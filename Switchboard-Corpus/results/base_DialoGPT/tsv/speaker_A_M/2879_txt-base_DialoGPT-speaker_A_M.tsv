M:	So what do you think of the relationship between Rome and New York?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	New York
A:	Uh-huh.  Yes.
M:	Yes.it.is.that
A:	Yeah, I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea, but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
M:	... uh, yes?
A:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.   Right, any ,  on the street, no, I know.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and Texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the, the I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
M:	...what
A:	and now, they can't find them and they're finding bodies in you know, I mean, you think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's over crowded, and you think how is, is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
M:	::.that.!
A:	I know.
M:	It
A:	And then,
M:	it is the first time,
A:	I don't know how Americans are about handguns but, uh, yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to accept the bill to access, to access handguns and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
M:	
A:	Is it, that's good.
M:	You can shoot through
A:	Say, that good,  I think that's, like the state of Virginia, yeah, that's great.
M:	I think, I think,, about, that, and
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I, uh, I'm not, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I know, because uh, I know.
A:	Uh-huh.   Right, they're no,  the cattiness behind, right, yeah,
M:	Er,
A:	I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
M:	I
A:	and how they just well, it hasn't been just but it was in the, I think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety
M:	The year before?
A:	and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad, you you know, this is nothing, and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but I actually, I mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,
M:	I
A:	I don't know,
M:	i have no idea what i'm talking
A:	I mean,
M:	That's, like, your opinion, man.
A:	So many times.
M:	and so many times
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh, he's not the only one,  you know,
M:	i know.
A:	you, you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime, there was something on, and this gets back to capital punishment, but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
M:	Wait, so they found out about it?
A:	and they buried her alive
M:	And the murder
A:	and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man, and, and at the end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh, that's nice.
M:	It's good
A:	I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting
M:	I've never heard that before. I'll have to check it out.
A:	Right, in that particular instance, uh, but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a and all and be all,
M:	Ahaaaaaaayyyy.
A:	that's the problem I have with it, in Texas they think it's and all and be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
M:	
A:	and we just moved here, uh, we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate, and then we were transferred back here, and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,
M:	now,
A:	and how, you're in,  Rome, New York,
M:	you.
A:	is that and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
M:	So, is that a question?
A:	What, what type of area is that,
M:	I live in the middle of nowhere, uh, and uh, I'm not even, uh
A:	is that in term,
M:	I'm in the area
A:	Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know what's going on in this picture but it's hilarious
A:	Sure.
M:	i know it's a joke, but it's still funny
A:	How would,  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,  and things that would,
M:	They do.
A:	not too bad.  Yeah.   Uh-huh.
M:	How bad?
A:	Not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,
M:	I can't. I can't be bothered to,,,
A:	yeah, now, Dallas is a I'm being very sarcastic, it's just a great,  uh,  on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,
M:	
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that, I mean, they really are over,  crowded,
M:	Money is their, money, money.
A:	I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh, and I just, you know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days, I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital punishment there.
M:	You're, like, but,
A:	Uh-huh.  Yeah, and I'm from Pittsburgh so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other
M:	You, you, uhhhh...
A:	Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up I and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,  years
M:	Uu '
A:	but, uh,
M:	It's ok, we can live in Pittsburgh
A:	There you go I don't know that's a different subject,  altogether
M:	I live in the west part, the east is like, I think.
A:	but, uh, I don't know I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime. I think everyone would, you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,  vehicle, uh,
M:	I'm not sure I'm understanding the question
A:	but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,  I think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah,
M:	I think everyone here would feel the same if they touched
A:	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me, you know,
M:	i think it's okay if you do it
A:	uh,
M:	no, i am not,
A:	Uh-huh.   Yeah, I just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate, I mean I just don't, uh, oh, I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, and I just, the subject, I remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things
M:	
A:	and you're thinking, oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh
M:	
A:	but, I don't know, methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either I just
M:	You
A:	Uh-huh.  Is it, uh, how about the injection,
M:	I don't have any ideas, I can you think of, u do, u,
A:	is that suppose to be.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	Yeah. I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, do you know which way it is the ratio, it's more than, aren't, uh, it's more that don't have it,
M:	It's just the state of being, isn't it?
A:	isn't that correct.
M:	The only thing that is a problem is the US.
A:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.
M:	What? You can't tell me what to do, I don't know what to say.
A:	Yeah, I don't know if they've, they did something about I'm not sure if Texas, Minnesota, I, they didn't, they didn't, they were well, did they have it, they were against it, uh, Texas, as I said, has it but I haven't been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,  if they've done it in the last,
M:	You.
