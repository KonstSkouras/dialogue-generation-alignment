M:	uh, uh
A:	Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
M:	Oh yeah?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, uh, know, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Well, what about random testing, though.
M:	I
A:	Do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
M:	It's not.
A:	I don't know that you do. If it's random, then it's random
M:	I know you do, I'm just asking how you know.
A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
M:	That's not how it works
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Do you know the difference between random and random.org?
A:	Yeah. Well, I I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test and it's not random.
M:	It's random.
A:	Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
M:	I don't think
A:	and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
M:	It
A:	And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
M:	And, and, and
A:	Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
M:	I'm serious.
A:	but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
M:	It's a drug use test
A:	and their manager assumes they have a drug problem I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.
M:	They do.
A:	It's an accusation, and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.
M:	what does that even mean?
A:	Right, exactly. I, I don't, the, I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.
M:	That,
A:	What type of job do you have?
M:	It.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's the job.
A:	Well, does your does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
M:	I have never had to work in a job that required me to be drug tested.
A:	Well, that doesn't, I mean I ...
M:	I've been told to not drive a car for several years now.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why is it illegal?
A:	That is odd. I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well, the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company
M:	What are you on about?
A:	so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
M:	
A:	Well, no, I don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I didn't, I mean,
M:	Yes??
A:	they don't know that I don't use drugs. They just tested me once.
M:	Drug tested.
A:	But, I used to work for a power company, so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
M:	I think they would have to give you a test, no?
A:	And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
M:	Uhhhuh. Uh
A:	No, they're, all of them are tested once every three
M:	Are they all tested?
A:	it's a rotation.
M:	It's a test.
A:	But it, but again, it depends on what job you're in.
M:	It's not, it's a good job.
A:	The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
M:	They're testing the men.
A:	But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
M:	And that's why I'm surprised they're hiring them.
A:	They say we, we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
M:	I know.
A:	Yeah, it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.
M:	Is that how they are?
A:	Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
M:	Oh? You've seen anything?
A:	Okay.
M:	Yes, it's not a problem.
A:	Okay.
M:	No, I think it was six or seven.
A:	Nice talking to you. Bye-bye
M:	You know what? I'm going to stop.
