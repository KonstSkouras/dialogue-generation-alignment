M:	It's not that.
A:	Uh, I think that's about where it is.
M:	What
A:	Uh, yeah, I do that, I, I do, uh, some Lotus on it. Uh, do some, uh, Samna, some, uh, P F M, uh, nothing extremely complex.
M:	So you just do the math, huh?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, yeah, I'm sure it's not very complicated.
A:	Yep.
M:	So, uh, what's the problem?
A:	Oh, yeah. I bet that's a pretty nice setup.
M:	I have a base for my PC, I have a few extra keyboards I use.
A:	Yep.
M:	I think I have that one. Is it a T?
A:	Wow.
M:	That's why I use my own spreadsheet
A:	Yep.
M:	Well, you know, that's true.
A:	Wow.
M:	The ability to move

A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	You're a tool.
A:	Right.
M:	Um. You?
A:	Well, um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M, and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect. So, I can never quite stay current with that.
M:	Are you still here?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Oh. Huh. I can I can believe that.
M:	.
A:	No, not really. I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.

A:	I can believe that. Well, it's, it's been interesting.
M:	So, it's your job?
A:	Yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
M:	...
A:	I is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?
M:	That's...
A:	That, that must be a fairly recent release.
M:	... That, that.
A:	Okay, okay. Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
M:	You, I, and the author, are all well aware.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Sure. Yeah.
M:	Oh. Well.
A:	I did too, and you have a good day.
