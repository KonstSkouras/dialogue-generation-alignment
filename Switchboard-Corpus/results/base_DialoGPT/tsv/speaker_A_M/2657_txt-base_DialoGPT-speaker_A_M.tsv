M:	It's not.
A:	See those type of people that, that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything
M:	Yeah, I know. I'm not a smart man.
A:	"Well, uh, I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers, and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective. Uh, I think this ""me"" generation has gone far too far. And the young people are overly impressed. And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint."
M:	L
A:	Uh, I personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though.
M:	Well, I'm not a little worried.
A:	But they have, I read somewhere, and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States. Have you ever heard about that one?
M:	i.
A:	Oh, really?
M:	You
A:	And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
M:	
A:	But she got credits for it?
M:	She's got a degree in economics, she's got plenty of money.
A:	That's very interesting.
M:	She got credits from Harvard for her law degree.
A:	Huh.
M:	She was a nurse and nurse practitioner.
A:	Yeah, I think that is an excellent program, I really do. I like that. And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.
M:	
A:	Right, you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,
M:	I'd
A:	but we could find one.
M:	That's what I said.
A:	We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	So, I, I can see the advantage to that one. The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?
M:	I'm not sure if it's a choice or not.
A:	It's still in existence.
M:	It was a joke
A:	I want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, uh, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.
M:	It is
A:	Yes. They,
M:	Do they?
A:	It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.
M:	I don't understand what you mean.
A:	And, yes, you're right, I think it's a sixties program. I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he, that was his big deal.
M:	I'm not sure what you mean.
A:	Right. Right. Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,
M:	I
A:	but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.
M:	I like
A:	But there's a,
M:	It's a pretty good game, I think
A:	Mandatory just like, like the draft. No.
M:	Mandate everyone to do a draft?
A:	Every time you, They could buy their way out.
M:	They could just be paid a minimum wage of 250,000 a year.
A:	Right, you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. Can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good.
M:	
A:	I don't know that it does. I, I, don't know that, um, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.
M:	
A:	You know, we're losing certain, races of people.
M:	it.
A:	There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.
M:	What are you, a historian?
A:	And I'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out. There's a German word for it that's elegant, but I never can remember what it was, uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.
M:	
A:	Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.
M:	
A:	Uh, when we were in Australia, uh, sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore, and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.
M:	They're
A:	And they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad.
M:	They're not really a side shows, they're more of a cult.
A:	But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people, and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	So, I, I'm wondering if the Peace Corps is, really an effective tool.
M:	I don't know. I think they would be.
A:	Good point. We've got enough without without a passport there's plenty.
M:	Can you get
A:	Yes. I think we ought to worry about our own species.
M:	I think we should be worried about the people who are in the military.
A:	I wonder now in, and I've been out of school too long to answer this, but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
M:	Social studies
A:	That's the last thing you want, to do.
M:	You
A:	Yeah, that's exactly it.
M:	I
A:	They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it. Now come on, let's be realistic,
M:	It's like, but you go
A:	that's just not realistic.
M:	The only reason I'm even considering it is because I'm trying to get my parents to give me a loan.
A:	Right.
M:	You can't go back to work.
A:	No, we're not I don't think. I think, that's more realistic than making them go in the Peace Corps.
M:	So do you think they are going to be on the Peace corps?
A:	I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
M:	That's not true.
A:	Uh, we've got plenty, in fact, we've got far too many. You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?
M:	N
A:	I was, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. Have you ever, have, have you been downtown
