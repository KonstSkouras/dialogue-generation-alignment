M:	
A:	Right, right.
M:	.right.
A:	Oh, yeah.  Okay.
M:	It's not a problem, it's a way to say you don't have a problem.
A:	You think that that's, uh, pretty adequate coverage and you get. Uh-huh. It's historic events, huh.
M:	What?
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	So.
A:	Yes.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't get it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	you might get more thorough, umm, from TV
A:	Um, I found out too, that, uh, quite often if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, uh, understanding or, or get, want to know more about it, that the, the newspaper or, uh, I read NEWSWEEK, can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V, but, uh, um, I found out that also on, on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N and, and like you said, the, the news shows that are, that are happening, and you can read some more about it if you want to. Um, I found out, though that, or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative. There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news, or, or bad news. And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
M:	...
A:	And, uh.
M:	
A:	Yes, we do.
M:	u.
A:	True, true.
M:	This is the only time in history that we have had news that happened.
A:	Uh-huh. I've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, but that takes time, that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
M:	
A:	and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things, so. I don't know, I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media
M:	..
A:	and we have to pay that price, but, uh, I don't know, I don't know. It's interesting, and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,
M:	It
A:	Exactly.  We saw,  Yes, you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that. So.
M:	This.
A:	Oh, yes.
M:	You know, I know.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	There was a World Series, right?
A:	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
M:	You mean like, you know, when they were playing in the Coliseum?
