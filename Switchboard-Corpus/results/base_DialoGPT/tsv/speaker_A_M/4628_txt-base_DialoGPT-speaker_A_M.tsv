A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... I don't know...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm guessing they are from a lab, but the fact that they have that much hair, I'm guessing it's a lab.
A:	Huh. Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place. I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
M:	Hahaha, you know, I'm not sure.
A:	Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
M:	Huh. Uh, you do?
A:	Uh, and, uh, so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T. So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution.
M:	Huh. So what?
A:	Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.

M:	Not really.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, that's right.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Ugh. Ugh. Uh
A:	Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
M:	Hehehuh
