M:	She nods.
A:	bit. Tell me how yours works. Well, at the I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we are, uh, we're on the east coast now.
M:	What? I'm from the US, and I've never heard of this.
A:	My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that, well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.
M:	I'm sorry for your
A:	And so naturally we put ourselves, we looked at our budget,
M:	And we all thought we were going to move there.
A:	and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, was realistic.
M:	But... we did draw up our budget...
A:	And, uh, so, we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory, and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
M:	u ouya lt 3
A:	So, you see,
M:	I mean, I'm not going to say it.
A:	Well, we actually planned for about one year.
M:	What's going on here?
A:	Uh, that God because, *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
M:	How long do you think the season will last?
A:	And, uh, what we did was just, uh, decide how we had been spending our money before,
M:	It was just a hypothetical.
A:	and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and, uh, and adjusted,  where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,
M:	And what we had to do.
A:	and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.
M:	Uh... uh... I mean, uh, I'm not gonna say it...
A:	But,
M:	i really hope they do
A:	Oh, just our own design.
M:	Didn't you have special programs on your computers to do it?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Haha!!!
A:	And the, so, but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, uh, you know, of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
M:	So. We've had this one, uh, so far.
A:	We spent too much money,  until our children went to college, so. So, tell me about,
M:	It's not really that complicated.
A:	do you all, uh, have a budget?
M:	Yeah, it's called a budget
A:	Wonderful.   Yes.
M:	
A:	Three and a two year old.
M:	
A:	Bang, *one utt?? bang.
M:	I'm trying to figure out how to pronounce this.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And you've been really busy, u
A:	Well, I think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though, you have to do something.
M:	
A:	Of course not.
M:	
A:	Well, I found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned,  but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.
M:	2.
A:	Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish,  gifts as,  we had done before.
M:	I see
A:	And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
M:	We're not.
A:	Yes.
M:	
A:	Well, I really do, I think you have to budget those things though.
M:	You're talking about the car?
A:	Yes.
M:	I'm guessing you're on the wrong website.
A:	Exactly, although so much per month anyway.
M:	I'm a student and I've got a car.
A:	And, uh, that really should be in your but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
M:	I have about 6 months worth of my money.
A:	Oh, no, no, no, no.
M:	You are correct. I'm not
A:	You don't want the government to spend your money. You want to be able,
M:	You're, to be
A:	Well, uh, but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people,
M:	This is how it works. If you have enough money, you have the money to buy something.
A:	and it was for us many years,  for many years.
M:	You could have saved up a few thousand dollars.
A:	Uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
M:	No. I want to see the eggs hatch
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I was just reading an article in, uh, a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, uh, letters of applications to universities.
M:	N.
A:	She was she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty, so, it can be done.
M:	This.
A:	Where there's a will,  where there's a will, there's a way, right?
M:	But I don't want to
A:	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you.
M:	Well, you're welcome
A:	Oh, I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard
M:	Yeah, well, I hope you have a nice weekend.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	I hope you have a good day.
