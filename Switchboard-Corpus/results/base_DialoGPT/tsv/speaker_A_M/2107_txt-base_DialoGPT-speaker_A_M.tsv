M:	They're both very pretty.
A:	I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years, I've had him probably five years.
M:	How old is your oldest one?
A:	Oh yes, I love my cats. I lost one, one time, uh,
M:	You must be so sad.
A:	the first one I got. He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.
M:	Ah. I didn't get that.
A:	And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.
M:	I think he was the one who made the cat out of his own heart.
A:	And it started raining and I was hysterical. I was, I was, I mean, you would have thought a child had died.
M:	He jumped off a balcony and I had to laugh at that
A:	I called everyone I knew, I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.
M:	Uhhh, you had a friend?
A:	And they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical.
M:	No, I told them that was the funniest cat ever.
A:	Oh yeah.
M:	Well, they did the same thing with the cat.
A:	The cat was here first so I know, it's hard.
M:	I think we need to talk
A:	Oh, how funny.
M:	I am.
A:	That's sweet, I have the two, the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.
M:	I'm going to say it. The cats.
A:	And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there, they love it. But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
M:	You're a big guy.
A:	Other than that he gets scared to death. If you shut that door he goes into hiding.
M:	He's
A:	I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
M:	When did he die?
A:	And Lord knows what happened to him. He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
M:	He's probably dead
A:	Probably.
M:	So, how many times is this gonna be posted?
A:	Are they.
M:	I bet they are
A:	Oh no.
M:	I am going to be so sad if we have to see any of my cats in the future.
A:	Oh my gosh.
M:	I know it's crazy, I'm a vet tech.
A:	Oh, I imagine.
M:	I think he was a dog, he was the most loving, the most obedient cat I ever had.
A:	I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.
M:	My cat's name is Tom, and he loves to play with the kids.
A:	Oh, I can imagine, what did he shoot him with.
M:	... I don't think I've ever seen a picture of him in my life.
A:	Oh my gosh. People are crazy.
M:	What did he do?
A:	Oh Lord.
M:	I'm not gonna lie, I cried.
A:	Oh man.
M:	He is a kitten!
A:	I imagine. They usually are after something like that happens to them. It seems to mellow them or something.
M:	How is the cat getting so much food?
A:	No.
M:	And you know that they are cats.
A:	Oh yeah, I I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,
M:	I think you're thinking of the cats.
A:	and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,
M:	I have a cat, it's okay.
A:	and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. But I can't give them up.
M:	You should just get a cat.
A:	I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.
M:	This is so confusing
A:	Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.
M:	But you don't need to worry about the cat.
A:	And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.
M:	I'm going crazy
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What? I'm just saying, I've never had a cat that was just that.
A:	Ugh!
M:	I don't want to make any promises, but I'm going to take a bath with a bath.
A:	Really.
M:	Oh, my.
A:	It's here now, we have to keep it. Yeah, my, my first one that I got, I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.
M:	You're not alone.
A:	So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.
M:	I'll take the free kitten
A:	And I thought well that's interesting, I'll call them.
M:	Yup. I'm from there.
A:	And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
M:	He was the last one, but he was only there for a couple of days.
A:	And he was the last one she carried across, you know, the whole big sad story.
M:	I don't think he was a baby, he was just the last person she had on the street.
A:	So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that.
M:	I didn't know he was so cruel.
A:	And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.
M:	I mean, he was born with a head.
A:	Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, so.
M:	I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you get better soon.
A:	But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.
M:	I'm sorry to hear that.
A:	He never meows, he, he doesn't have any front claws, I had him declawed,
M:	He's adorable, what happened to him?
A:	but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.
M:	But he doesn't bite anyone.
A:	Oh yeah, yeah, we do, we call that doing biscuits,
M:	C
A:	"it looks like their kneading bread *spelling ""their"" should be ""they're"""
M:	Oh yea, yes
A:	Oh, I just love cats. I like dogs, they're okay, I had, I had a dog when I lived at home
M:	You've got to be kitten me.
A:	but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.
M:	You're a little late on the cat hate train.
A:	Oh yeah, they do.
M:	Do they?
A:	Oh they are. I love it, it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.
M:	I love the idea of a cat fighting a dog.
A:	And they just act so funny.
M:	Because of the cats
A:	Really.
M:	We have a cat, I think we have a brother.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, I'm sorry?
A:	A train of cats running around.
M:	The train of kittens.
A:	Oh how funny, I can imagine. Yeah, I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death.
M:	Not sure if it's a joke, but my cats are just like that. They're very affectionate and sweet.
A:	What are your cats' names.
M:	The best part is that my cats'names are the same.
A:	Oh, how sweet.
M:	That's just what my cats like to do.
A:	I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.
M:	What are you using?
A:	Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like. Nothing. Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,
M:	What are the names of the colors?
A:	and Rascal is a black and white short hair.
M:	Yes, I think that's what I said.
A:	They don't look a thing a like,
M:	They look like a.
A:	and they came from the same litter and everything.
M:	The same person?
A:	Oh.
M:	That's a tortoise.
A:	So ugly she's cute, right.
M:	You can't tell me what to do.
A:	Really.
M:	I know she's not in a relationship, but I don't care.
A:	Oh.
M:	She's beautiful.
A:	Is she the oldest one?
M:	I know you are, but what am I?
A:	Really.
M:	Yes she is.
A:	Oh I know it's like the end of the world.
M:	I know it is, but I don't want to be mean.
A:	I know that's how I am about Xanadu.
M:	The beginning of the end
A:	Oh definitely.
M:	You guys get so cute together.You're the best
A:	Yeah.
M:	Your mother has cats?
A:	You can walk a dog and that's okay for weekend but cats are good all the time.
M:	I love dogs, but I hate dogs.
A:	It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem
M:	Wouldn't that be a bit of a problem for a dog?
A:	Have you seen those, uh, do you ever read COSMO.
M:	I can't even get a dog to walk a cat, I'm not even a cat owner.
A:	There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, you know, they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats. And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards. It was so funny.
M:	h
A:	Watch me.
M:	That, of, of!
A:	Definitely.
M:	I'
A:	Oh I wouldn't either. There'd be no way.
M:	Well I wouldn t mind if they left the cat alone.
A:	Oh really, oh well.
M:	They said they would do it.
A:	That's life, that's how life goes.
M:	Oh my god.
A:	I know, I love mine too. Well, it's been nice talking to you.
M:	Ah, I love you too.
A:	Me to. Bye, bye.
M:	You have a nice day.
