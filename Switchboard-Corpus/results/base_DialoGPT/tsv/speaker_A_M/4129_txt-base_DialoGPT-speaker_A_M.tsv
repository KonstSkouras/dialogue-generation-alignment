M:	Texas is the only state that is currently doing this.
A:	Yes, that's similar to Georgia.
M:	They practice capital, uh, murder, uh?
A:	That's probably true considering, Yes. Yes, uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,
M:	Not.
A:	Yes. Right, that would be the intent of it.
M:	No.
A:	Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals.
M:	I mean, I'm sure it would, but I think
A:	Yeah, if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,
M:	I think it's a little bit more complicated than that.
A:	Uh, I'm a research engineer, I work, uh, with Georgia Tech.
M:	What do you study?
A:	Um.
M:	ummm, uh, how do you feel about that?
A:	Yes.
M:	I think you mean elementary school.
A:	Um.
M:	Well, in a small town in a rich region of England.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. But I think it would be a lot easier to do if we could just do it for the other ones.
A:	Um, that's probably true, but I guess there's other factors that,
M:	We'd be better off if we had the money to buy the kids.
A:	But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,
M:	I think they'd be better off in the UK if they had to choose between the two.
A:	but it's not going to, Oh, I see.
M:	It's a lot of money, and a lot less money than in the US.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... and then
A:	Um.
M:	How are you liking the
A:	So that's a difficult situation.
M:	They were being deported to the Philippines for questioning.
A:	Um.
M:	Uhh... what?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes, but it is possible for them to be in the
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's wrong with that?
A:	Well, that's probably true.
M:	It's because we're all so weird
A:	Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. There's, there's no easy solution for that.
M:	I've been in the same boat as you.I'm just going to have to live with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not quite sure,
A:	I'm sure it is, yeah.
M:	But it's cheaper to send the kid
A:	Um, yeah, I don't, I don't, certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
M:	If the solution to any of these problems is to give the death penalty, then it's not going to work.
A:	but,
M:	And that's why I don'think it's going to fix anything
A:	Uh,
M:	are you for the murder of the whole of the planet?
A:	I guess I am  for certain
M:	I would say that it is pretty accurate
A:	yeah,  in certain crimes.
M:	It's a good thing you're not a criminal
A:	Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
M:	Do you know what crimes are committed by people using it?
A:	any mass murderer type individual.
M:	I think it should be a crime.
A:	Um. Uh-huh. Well, you always have castration
M:	What are you, a murderer?
A:	Yes, I read about that
M:	You know, the one time a girl was elected to the state legislature, and she was found not guilty of anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	They are all up votes.
