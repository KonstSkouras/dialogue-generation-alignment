M:	you.
A:	Some buildings do, it depends on the location. The area I live in right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all, no burglar alarms, no guards.
M:	I.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	that
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes, I'm.
A:	Uh-huh. Um.
M:	Uh, we have a lot in common.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhuhuh. And.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, uh, they're all over the place.
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	Uuh, uh, uh...
A:	Uh-huh. There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.
M:	What about Dallas?
A:	Yeah, it's really sad.
M:	Well, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
M:	You're not alone.
A:	Oh, I agree. I think that people are getting off too easy. They're getting, they're getting paroled too easily.
M:	I agree
A:	They're just getting, uh, put on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room so they get, they get lighter sentences,
M:	And they're going to get... uh, they're just going to be put on parades and they're not going to...
A:	and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.
M:	That's what I was saying. They get off.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	You know
A:	Oh my gosh.
M:	',,.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think he was in prison.
A:	Uh, that's terrible.
M:	I have a son. He's out.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, the one that had a job, and then he went to jail, that he had a problem with, that was the problem.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You think?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhuh. And?
A:	Yeah.
M:	The reason you're doing this is because of the way the laws are.
A:	Right, it's a little more understandable under the circumstances, I guess.
M:	That's true, but I think it's because he's in jail, and he's being held at gunpoint
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But if they are from another country, they are still citizens of that country.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, that's a very good point.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... what if they are innocent?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, no.
A:	Right, we have enough, enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is. So let, let their country take care of it.
M:	You are correct. They are not the same.
A:	We don't have, I guess too much trouble in Dallas with, well, I guess, I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico, that cause problems, but, uh.
M:	They're not going to come in because they have no problems.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Mexico. We have.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhhh, I think.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	It's like you know, uh, where the women are from.
A:	Uh-huh. It was amazing I went to the Far East, uh, back in October to do some training for T I and I,
M:	uhh. uh.
A:	uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal. Singapore is very, supposed to be very safe and, in fact, Tokyo, and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
M:	Ughuh
A:	but they, at, at the T I there, I said is there any area I should avoid. And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself, or anything. And she, she thought for a few minutes and she said, no. And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. She said, no. And they said, it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
M:	she?
A:	and somebody will turn it in and, and nothing will be missing. They said they can just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that. I thought, boy, in America, if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.
M:	...
A:	Yeah, that's true,
M:	i
A:	that's true. But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.
M:	It.
A:	I mean, I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place. They said, the, apparently the crime, is, just, uh,
M:	No, they were talking about the crimes.
A:	I'm not sure what it is there. Now, I know what it is in Singapore, is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it,
M:	
A:	like for drugs, for drugs they, they enforce the death penalty for that. Uh, they're just, very, very tough, and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too, or Japan is too. They're just very tough on criminals.
M:	Japan
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, no, no. They're
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's uh uh, it's a country.
A:	Uh-huh, oh yeah.
M:	uuhuh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, uh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um... I think we can get them out of here.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	We're not all bad, but there are some people who deserve to get out of jail.
A:	Right, and if they're overcrowded, well, you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place.
M:	And if they get overcrowded, well, they should have been put away.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	...
A:	Oh, yeah, I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that, that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,
M:	It's a shame that you're getting downvoted.
A:	Right.
M:	No, it's all fair
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's okay. I'll give you a safe
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What if I told you that the laws were harsher?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhuh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, you don't know what a joke is.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Oh no, not you.
A:	Right, not much.
M:	You pay them.
A:	Yeah, huh-uh, and especially not in some of these big cities, like in Dallas I mean they've had, they're up in the top, top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on, on, in the line of duty and that's really sad.
M:	Not all of them. There are a lot of places where police are not the most effective.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	A few hundred dollars a day
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	How are they?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... you are still out there.
