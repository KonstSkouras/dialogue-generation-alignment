M:	Ugh, the parents of kids who are going to school tomorrow.
A:	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
M:	You are not disciplined.
A:	You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
M:	I'm not a child, I'm a human being.
A:	Yeah, that's right,  that's right.
M:	I know, that's why I said I was a little bit scared.
A:	My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
M:	It's a girl
A:	and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
M:	Uhhh, and, uh, teacher, who's the teacher?
A:	and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
M:	Uhhh, uh, um, yeah, uh...
A:	Uh-huh. Well, they, they just don't do that any more.
M:	I was told that they are, uh, the teachers.
A:	But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
M:	We are.
A:	And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
M:	We don't, that's why.
A:	And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
M:	It's a joke
A:	Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
M:	...
A:	You know, I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that but, um, and what else, um, I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
M:	It's
A:	I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
M:	What
A:	Oh, yeah,
M:	That's right.
A:	I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
M:	That's why I keep a high school teacher's number.
A:	Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
M:	... um... um... you know, um...
A:	Uh-huh, so.
M:	So.what do you think?
A:	Yeah, okay, so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
M:	I am not really interested in the subject matter.
A:	Yeah. Okay, well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	It was a joy in talking with you.
M:	I'm fine.
A:	Okay, thanks.
M:	Sorry. I just wanted to say, I have a feeling that the others are the same as me.
A:	Bye.
