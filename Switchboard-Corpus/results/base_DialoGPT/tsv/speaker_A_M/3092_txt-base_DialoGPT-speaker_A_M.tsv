M:	You have no idea how hard it is to be a troll.
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	No, you have!
A:	Okay, well, yes I do.
M:	You don't have any proof.
A:	In fact, I am at work right now. Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela. Uh, I think what is really important, uh, of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job. And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits. Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
M:	...
A:	Okay. And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. And, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
M:	No.
A:	Like, uh, perhaps, uh, he has, uh, the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family, uh, uh, and how much coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um, probably dental. How important you think that would be.
M:	I
A:	Because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
M:	Why?
A:	Right,
M:	But... I don't have any of those...
A:	right.
M:	I'd like to know why you think it's a good idea to get a job with the government if you don't have a job.
A:	And they always have surprises for you.
M:	I think they are usually just random.
A:	With children,
M:	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he's always surprised when he wakes up.
A:	You know, and so, it's, it is, uh, we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.
M:	The US has no problem with this, and it's not a business
A:	You would still have something.
M:	Well, that's the problem.
A:	Right.
M:	Not with your own money.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh. They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
M:	
A:	And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles and professions.
M:	Many, uh, uh
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Would, it would, It would be just futile.
M:	...
A:	And they would not have the quality,
M:	If they had a job.
A:	And they,  would be deprived of their mother.
M:	They would be in the hospital.
A:	Yeah. No, I understand that totally
M:	Well, that's just the way it is.
A:	Oh, I hear , Yes, that's true.
M:	There are a lot women out there.
A:	Right.
M:	You mean to go home early and have a night of alone time?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why would you be in the hospital?
A:	Yes. Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting? Do you think that would be, acceptable?
M:	Are you saying that if I had a kid I would go to the hospital?
A:	I do too.
M:	Does it? I mean, if you want to fund it, it would.
A:	Right, that you, Right. That's right.
M:	If you're a company, you get paid, and if
A:	With the company than,  than having to go,  That's , that's right. Yes, I, agree with that.
M:	Well, I agree with you, but I can see it
A:	That would be fair.
M:	This is the best idea ever.
A:	Yeah.
M:	The company.
A:	Uh, and how, how do you feel about, uh, let's see, eye care?
M:	I dont care.I just want to know
A:	Okay.
M:	Eye Care.
A:	Vision, I guess it's called, vision care.
M:	Vision, I think it's a great idea.
A:	It depends on who examines your eyes.
M:	How would it work?
A:	If you have an, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, uh, professionals.
M:	I'm not sure if I'm a little bit biased or not, but I don't see any difference.
A:	Glaucoma.
M:	What is glaucomas?
A:	Oh. Oh, okay, so,
M:	I'm sure she does, she has it
A:	Yes.
M:	Are they changing?
A:	Uh-huh. Yes, they are.
M:	They are... but are they?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And the insurance is on her.
A:	Right, that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
M:	Yeah, she is. She is a doctor.
A:	Yes, and, you know, we have, uh, needs in our life that are unique to us and, uh, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
M:	You know, uh, that's pretty good.
A:	I mean, we are all different so,
M:	She's a human.
A:	Well, no that's my other phone.
M:	And? You are the one who is talking about the other phone.
A:	So, that's it that's okay, my, that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation,
M:	She's still here, I'm just not sure if she's a good person or not.
A:	so, it's okay.
M:	What is?
A:	Uh-huh. That's very expensive.
M:	How much do you think it is?
A:	Yes, that's true. Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
M:	You can get dental care at the dentist for free.
A:	Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, uh, not, uh, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
M:	That's true.
A:	I know, two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
M:	You mean like a regular tooth?
A:	And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing and when they were young.
M:	You had to foot the bill for the teeth
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	It's not an orthodon. It's a pallet.
A:	Uh-huh, major.
M:	You know, he's a big guy
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, what?
A:	Well, I tell you I, I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in, in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
M:	How many teeth do you have?
A:	It's, it's less painful and less expensive.
M:	Why is it so painful?
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, you're saying they're not?
A:	I, I know, but it, it's, it's, uh, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
M:	Aesthetic is the most important part of a treatment.
