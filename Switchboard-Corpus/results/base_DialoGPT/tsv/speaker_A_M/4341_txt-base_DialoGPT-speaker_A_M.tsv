M:	and
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, I think that's an extreme situation.
A:	So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.
M:	Uhh, you're thinking of a serial killer.
A:	Right.
M:	I meant that I like it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society.
M:	Serial murder
A:	Right. And then do it all over again. Uh-huh.
M:	And then the police would just do it in prison.
A:	Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it I just, I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh,
M:	
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh, huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.
M:	I,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhuhuh. Uuhuhuuhuh
A:	I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. Uh,
M:	You don't understand.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment.
M:	
A:	Right.
M:	
A:	Might make you feel better but
M:	i
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Well, I don't know, I think it's a possibility
A:	Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh. Right, because they're a danger to everybody else. Huh, that's interesting. I have to, uh agree with that.
M:	Yeah, but I think it's just the most likely scenario.
A:	There's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that, uh, that aren't really a danger to society, huh, and, uh,
M:	Uh, uh, I don't, uh...
A:	Right. Right, probably more of them then the other way around Interesting. I don't, I don't, not sure I, I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital punishment we have here.
M:	You, eh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry? I'm sorry.
