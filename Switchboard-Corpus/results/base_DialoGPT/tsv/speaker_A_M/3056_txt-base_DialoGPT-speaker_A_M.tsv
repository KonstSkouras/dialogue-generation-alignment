M:	I'm reading a book, uh, about the first world war, uh
A:	Who wrote that?
M:	I think that's the first time I've read a book I haven't read in a while.
A:	Huh.
M:	...
A:	I see.
M:	
A:	Well, that is interesting. Right.
M:	No.
A:	That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
M:	He's talking about the book.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think it's real.
A:	And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
M:	They haven't even made a film of it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Have you seen the movie?
A:	Uh. Explained , *listen; could be br
M:	
A:	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	The'n' we.not.they.not.
A:	Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
M:	
A:	I, I think that would be, I am sure there is something out there, uh, ,
M:	i.
A:	I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
M:	It's a bit of a shame, I think she's still alive.
A:	Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Of course, you know, it is so weird, cause no one will ever really know, it's, it, so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things.
M:	I don't know.
A:	That is for sure.
M:	I like it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Wait, what?
A:	Right. Well, I, I guess I just have not read I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
M:	Yeah, I read.
A:	and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
M:	It was
A:	And I just really, really liked the way he writes. It's just, incredible.
M:	I like it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Did you read it?
A:	Uh.
M:	I read that.
A:	That was good, I think. And, and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, uh,
M:	You.
A:	BON  yeah.
M:	You're the best.
A:	Uh. Yeah I, that was really, really good, the movie was nothing compared to the book.
M:	There is no way you read that, you should be ashamed.
A:	And. Yeah.
M:	He was in the movie
A:	Oh, the movie was a joke compared to, I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
M:	I think he's talking about the movie.
A:	and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
M:	I'm not really sure what you're saying.
A:	And, anyway, we are not talking about that, but, uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden and, uh, And, uh,
M:	i, do.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm reading
A:	Like, what is a book on your list, you know I have a list too and I have never gotten to it
M:	You.
A:	Oh.
M:
