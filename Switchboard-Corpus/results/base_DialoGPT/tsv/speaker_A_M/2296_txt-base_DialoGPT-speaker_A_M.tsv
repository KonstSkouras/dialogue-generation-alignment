A:	Uh, very good.
M:	I do. I don't, uh, exercise.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhm.
A:	Yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. I know, my son is a biker and he, he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
M:	i love it
A:	And so, but that somehow takes, organization. For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading,
M:	Uhh, I'm not sure, but it looks nice
A:	Um, but,
M:	... and so, you can.
A:	No, I live in Maryland.
M:	You're in the district, right?
A:	Right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
M:	You have a lot of work to do in the area.
A:	I mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops so I do. Now, I think, um, basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?
M:	It's just a bit of fun
A:	Uh-huh, right. I think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.
M:	...
A:	Oh, well, that's great, that's great.
M:	and.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I just,
A:	Right. And actually in, in summer I like to swim. We don't have facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake, I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
M:	
A:	So.
M:	I dont think so.
A:	No, I'm not.
M:	Do you?
A:	No.
M:	Are you in the US?
A:	Oh, really.
M:	Not sure why you're getting downvoted, I have no idea.
A:	No, I don't know that. But, I, I must say, that, um, when, when I did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.
M:	What, you don't have a proper accent?
A:	And it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California, and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot,
M:	You, I, I speak English,
A:	In Santa Barbara.
M:	Where
A:	Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Well, very good, I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits
M:	I'm in
A:	and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
M:	Yes, I'm a student.
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	He was talking to me.
A:	Bye-bye.
