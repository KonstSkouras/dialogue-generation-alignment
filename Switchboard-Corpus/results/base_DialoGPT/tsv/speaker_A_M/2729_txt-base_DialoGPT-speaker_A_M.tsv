A:	and, uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
M:	Uuhh... so, uh, why?
A:	She's, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
M:	So what's the backstory?
A:	I mean she actually asks to go out.
M:	What about the dog?
A:	And, uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
M:	This dog is so cute!!!
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Aww. She's a sweetie.
A:	Oh, really.
M:	She's a dog.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	She's so cute!
A:	Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
M:	Hehe, I'm glad you're okay.
A:	and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
M:	uhuhuh. and I uh, I think.
A:	um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.
M:	I can't even...
A:	And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
M:	He's also got the ability to move his car.
A:	So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard.
M:	I don't think I could've seen him like that.
A:	And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
M:	He had a pet dog, a pet rabbit, a dog and a dog
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
M:	I don't know. I'm not sure.
A:	And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did and, uh. She was really attached to it,
M:	I feel like this dog
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
M:	I don't care.
A:	Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
M:	uh, huh.
A:	Uh, it was in March of last year. So, uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
M:	Uhh, it's been a while.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, uh, it was last year.
A:	Right.
M:	You're just sooo far away from me.
A:	My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
M:	My dog's name is beagle. He passed away.
A:	no how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, I or, I Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
M:	Haha,
A:	And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing, but, mom went an,
M:	That's back.
A:	Yeah.
M:	He she's good
A:	Yeah, it is. Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
M:	He smiles and smiles back. Good.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's your favorite animal?
A:	Yeah.
M:	She's a golden retriever
A:	Right.
M:	Like, a golden retriever?
A:	Oh.
M:	Yeah.But shes a strawberry.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh... Um...
A:	Yeah.
M:	So she's not a brown eyed girl?
A:	That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
M:	Rosebtwink
A:	they're always, always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	Is that a dog?
A:	Right.
M:	She's so cute.
A:	This, this friend of mine has, well it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this, they just, they had a ball romping around,
M:	
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
M:	the.my.the.water.
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
M:	I'll go fishing for you're fishing, you, fishing, they're fishing.
A:	Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
M:	What a great story. He's so good.
A:	But he jumped in, in the, the river.
M:	He's in the river.
A:	Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
M:	Did the puppy jump in the river?
A:	'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
M:	Why is it so wet?
A:	And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.
M:	
A:	Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
M:	You
A:	and so, but, uh, she got over it, so.
M:	...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	She was so...
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	Uhh... well, you know.
A:	Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I mean, I've got, the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose, but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,
M:	
A:	so.
M:	You okay?
A:	Oh really.
M:	It's not like they're dangerous.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm sorry?
A:	No, no.
M:	Are you the one who did?
A:	Oh really.
M:	I know.
A:	Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
M:	He's not a dog, he's a dog.
A:	normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
M:	Umm... he
A:	Yeah.
M:	I guess she's not too fond of it then.
A:	Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
M:	He didn't say he was.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
A:	I'll have to check it out. I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie, but,
M:	
A:	uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
M:	I haven't seen the movie, but I hear the soundtrack is good.
A:	But, I got to do more, more fun things.
M:	It's a lot of fun
A:	Yeah, yeah. Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so I travel a lot.
M:	I was just talking about the movies.
A:	And yeah, I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, so.
M:	... And you're an engineer?
A:	That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
M:	I'm a pilot and I work in the military, so.
A:	But it's nice having a dog here, uh, the,
M:	No, I mean the dog.
A:	uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
M:	Oh, uh, there's uh, no.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I see
A:	No, no.
M:	You don't know what I'm talking about, you're talking about the dog.
A:	Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
