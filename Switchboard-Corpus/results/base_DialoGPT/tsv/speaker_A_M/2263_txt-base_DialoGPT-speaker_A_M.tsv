A:	Oh, really? Oh. You really rough it then.
M:	I'm not a native, I just like to go
A:	Uh-huh. Do you do that very often?
M:	Yeah, I do.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Uh-huh. You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
M:	Um. I don't do that often.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Ahh, uh huh.
A:	That would be really great.
M:	I'm thinking about making a trail, but I don't know how.
A:	Pardon?
M:	You're a real loser.
A:	Uh-huh. That sounds like it'd be fun. Did you go alone or with a group or,
M:	I'm the one who goes alone.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I've been to a few of these places.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, that's great. Long as it's not raining.
M:	Well, I mean, we did just go to a wedding.
A:	Uh-huh. Really, oh, that would be,
M:	Yeah, I have a cave in my back yard.
A:	Huh-uh. Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
M:	I'm in Texas.
A:	Yes
M:	Are you a native?
A:	Are you in Texas, now?
M:	I live in Texas.
A:	Oh. Okay.
M:	Yeah. It's a part of a game.
A:	Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas, but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
M:	I'm in the same state.
A:	Uh-huh. Well you kind of know what it's like, then. Yeah.
M:	Ohio. I've lived in the UP since I was in high school.
A:	But, we've, uh, we've done, uh, many types of camping. We've, we've done tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
M:	Oh, you mean you're in Ohio
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, we've never done it
A:	Right. Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on. We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, Delaware along the ocean most every year. And that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
M:	I was.
A:	Huh?
M:	Uhuhuh. Uhuhuhuh
A:	Oh, maybe my, dropping my phone. Is that better?
M:	What do you mean, you're losing me?
A:	Oh. But,
M:	It's fading out.
A:	Yeah. Well, we used to, we don't as much anymore, but, uh, we used to. We kind of slowed down a little bit. But, uh, I think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining. If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
M:	What happened?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... I'm sorry
A:	I don't think I would like that. What kind?
M:	Is it a snake?
A:	Oh. Those aren't too pleasant.
M:	... I guess.
A:	Yeah. We have some of them around here. You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
M:	They are...
A:	Oh.
M:	The last time they were here they werent.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why did you say it?
A:	Uh-huh. But you still backpacked and camped out.
M:	Oh.Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I was just kidding.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	How was it?
A:	Yeah. I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
M:	I know enough about it.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, I would think, I would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too.
M:	Oh yeah. I don't know anything about that.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, is your brother younger than you or,
M:	I can't even say that
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, that's great, that'd be a lot of fun. You have a lot good experiences from that. Yeah.
M:	It
A:	Did you really? What, black ones?
M:	I know.
A:	Yeah.  That would be exciting.
M:	I'm pretty sure you can
A:	Yeah, they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
M:	They are the best of friends.
A:	They're on the increase in this area.
M:	That's the scary part.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not sure...
A:	The black bear.
M:	What are they?
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	Heh, yeah.
A:	Yeah,  the population's been really up. They've, uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, uh, increasing so much.
M:	You can't even get rid off the bears in the wild.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Nah, they're up there
A:	Yeah. But, uh, we, we really like camping. I, I must say that, uh, we we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping and, uh.
M:	Thanks
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Like the trees.
A:	It's just, so, it's a lot of work, too
M:	I, uh, I don't know what to say, uh
A:	it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything. But it's, um, it's really refreshing. So,
M:	Yeah. It's, uh, nice.
A:	I think so Well, it was really good hearing from you and I hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
M:	It's really, um, nice to see you again.
A:	Okay. Thanks a lot, and you have a good day.
M:	Well, I'm going to, uh, I mean, uh... I'm sorry
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	See you around then.
