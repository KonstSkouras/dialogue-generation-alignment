M:	The most jarring thing about this is the and
A:	and
M:	You can say that again
A:	Right, right.
M:	Yeah, right
A:	Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
M:	What do you do for a living?
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
M:	I do, uh, err, don't I
A:	but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
M:	I don't think you can
A:	I like it.
M:	You're so... meh
A:	I like it, uh, part of my problem is I have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
M:	I guess that's one way to do it.
A:	Of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
M:	Yeah, uh.
A:	Right, you don't notice it  as much,
M:	I
A:	yeah.
M:	no, no, don't. I don' not really, it's, no.
A:	You feel it, don't you?
M:	... yeah, I feel it.
A:	It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
M:	You do.
A:	Do you enjoy it, or is it, uh. If you can have, find the time it's just the.
M:	It
A:	Yeah, it is hard
M:	It's, uh, uh like, that, that's, that
A:	it is hard. It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
M:	What is it?
A:	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
M:	My plan is to wake me up earlier.
A:	Don't get enough sleep as it is, right
M:	You do?
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
M:	... what?
A:	You feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
M:	I think I'm going to sleep, what's going on?
A:	If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
M:	It's a game, man.
A:	I do. I have to be real careful.
M:	Oh, so you don't have to eat much sugar, boy.
A:	Did you?

A:	Makes a lot of difference.
M:	I eat meat.
A:	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
M:	I eat a lot
A:	Right.
M:	... so it's basically a meatball?
A:	And unless you really like, uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
M:	I'd like to have a couple of fish.
A:	Kind of see what happens.
M:	I ate a lot and now I have no appetite.
A:	I've tried to do that with sugar
M:	I do that all the time, and it works.
A:	everything has sugar in it . I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
M:	It's all about the sugar in ketchup.
A:	Course, and I like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
M:	You like ketchup?
A:	but. Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
M:	You're so nice.
A:	Okay.
M:	I know, I'm just telling you that's how it sounded.
A:	Well, you, too. Good luck, uh, enjoy college while you can. Let me tell you it's, uh.
