M:	Ah. Cool.
A:	Yeah.
M:	No. No.
A:	Well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year?
M:	The Cardinals have been pretty good this year.
A:	Two.
M:	I mean, how many games have you won?
A:	Yeah. But they're not doing bad. People are pretty surprised that they, I mean they beat the Giants.
M:	This is a really bad list.
A:	I bet
M:	It was fun
A:	Oh, boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
M:	This is why I always go to the toilet
A:	Yep.
M:	I bet all of them were right on the roof.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, well, I am, I'm a big football fan. I never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it. And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.
M:	...
A:	And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football. So,
M:	Nope,
A:	Yep.
M:	You can't be.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, you know, you can't just... uh... join them.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. Well.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, I do. I just, I love it. It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport. And, uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet. We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet. But, uh,
M:	...
A:	Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here
M:	You're gonna get it?
A:	That's even harder. But,
M:	I think we can.
A:	No, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. We've only been married for five and a half years. And, uh, we have two small children, and he had a, uh, just got transferred here to E-Systems, so.
M:	Are they?
A:	Oh. Well, I tell you this, the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, you know, and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, you know, there's snow and it's an adventure And here, yeah you've just got to drive down to the, to the stadium
M:	I
A:	and, uh,
M:	It's, I've been
A:	Yes.
M:	Do you?
A:	Well, he's from here.
M:	So what?
A:	That's what I hear.
M:	And he's a very nice guy.
A:	Which is rare.
M:	You could always cheer for the Cowboys
A:	Which is good. Yeah. But, uh, I, you know, it's funny in, in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last, I don't know, five or six years whatever it's been. Um, they have these songs on the radio. They take popular songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the Broncos and stuff.
M:	It's not the worst thing.
A:	And they had, I was just thinking about one the other day. Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, um, but they did the Johnny Angel. They did Johnny Elway to that.
M:	I am...
A:	And, and I was trying to get my son to sing that. My husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song But, they, they do a lot of fun things. I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. Because you know there's just,
M:	
A:	It's exciting.
M:	Just, it's so exciting
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you like football?
A:	Yeah. Yeah, they I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado. Because, uh, I, I think about that a lot. But, you know, when I first moved here was when they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. This interstate seventy-five song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.
M:	Ohh.
A:	That was kind of a funny song but they sure do, it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here. Even when they were losing pitifully, you know, people still support them. We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs, we love the
