A:	Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
M:	They said they were from the south
A:	Yeah.
M:	You mean it would be?
A:	Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long.
M:	It's probably not a bad idea.
A:	That's right. That, that would be the problem. Sure would.
M:	If you don't want to be in the military, you don't have to serve anyone.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
M:	You.
A:	I'm not sure what but,
M:	I think it's a good idea
A:	I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know, a super do salary of any kind.
M:	They should get their own college credit.
A:	but that, that kind of takes away from public service.
M:	I'd say the same thing about a super salary.
A:	But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail, that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know. I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
M:	I
A:	I'm not either really.
M:	You know, that.
A:	That's right.
M:	
A:	That's right.
M:	I know
A:	Uh-huh. That's right. Absolutely. They need, young families, whatever,
M:	And then there's the kids who are born to be teenagers.
A:	they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
M:	You could say they were... so far.
A:	Oh,
M:	it's a question.
A:	That's right, uh-huh.
M:	they're both the same, right?
A:	Uh-huh, it sure would. It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like that, I would think.
M:	You're thinking of the most popular, not the most common.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It would be interesting to see how many people would go.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I, uh, know.
A:	That's right. I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.
M:	I think the only way to fix it is to have it run the program, and then not fix it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	This is not an answer
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm gonna.go
A:	Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
M:	Like if they went to a different country.
A:	That's right. Yeah, that's, that's true too. That's true too.
M:	I think they're all right.
A:	Yeah, yeah. Me neither. And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
M:	yeah,?
A:	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
M:	I mean, you can do that anyway.
A:	Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
M:	I'm not sure if it's hard or not.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm not sure either. But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.
M:	I think, they will.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I don't think they can be a'school '
A:	Yeah.
M:	Yes.Yeah. It's, it's.
A:	Yeah. That's right.
M:	It isnt.But if they had to spend a lot more money on advertising, it wouldnt be a lot, but it would be.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I guess.Yeah.Its a little hard to explain.They are like a small group of people.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a lot of stuff to do.
A:	Right.
M:	i think you mean like, you have to be a volunteer for the school, not a community member
A:	That's right. Yeah. That's a real waste too. It really is.
M:	I think they're volunteering for community
A:	I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
M:	They have a lot of things that we don't.
A:	that was, that was a big thing with him.
M:	What? That's not a thing.
A:	And, I guess even back to Kennedy, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	I just don't hear much about it anymore. Like I say, I don't even know what programs are, are even ongoing now, you know.
M:	There's a lot of people who are still alive who don't know about it.
A:	Anyway, it's a tough question.
M:	Well, I don t know.
A:	Okay, well thanks for your time. I enjoyed talking to you.
M:	Well, it's not my fault, I have a lot of people to work with.
A:	Okay, take care.
M:	You too.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	Ok, bye.
