A:	and actually I'm concerned that they're not. I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
M:	So they are.
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.
M:	There's one of those that was working for the American Cancer Society, and then the same one who worked for the British Cancer Society.
A:	And these were from other, people from other countries. He's a translator.
M:	He's a human translator.
A:	And in talking to the people from France he said, you know, he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is. And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
M:	It's so scary.
A:	Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more. I don't know that spending more always gets it.
M:	You're
A:	You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
M:	Yes.
A:	yeah.
M:	Are you saying we should spend more money on cancer research?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	.
A:	Well it, I, I agree with you there because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
M:	i, uh, i, uh.
A:	Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served? Uh, that's a good point.
M:	So you agree with that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... treating.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You don't.
A:	Well, and one of the things I'd, and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
M:	
A:	That's, that's the part that,
M:	What
A:	That's the part that scares me, you know. I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals, well no, it's for homosexuals and gays, well no, actually, it's, I mean, you know. Did they know that all along?
M:	No.
A:	Oh
M:	I...
A:	Right.
M:	It was
A:	And how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
M:	How is it transmitted?
A:	Which is, I think, what they also don't know. I mean that's, I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
M:	You don't think that's what they meant?
A:	It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
M:	They're not going to let you do that, but it's good to know.
A:	In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that, and it's huge over there. So I, I, you know, and it's beginning, other countries that's what's his point. This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
M:	?
A:	And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?
M:	It's not.
A:	I mean I don't know. All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know. Uh, or maybe they understand but,
M:	So it's the scarier.
A:	Yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back. If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
M:	You mean there are
A:	Yeah, right. I'll take anything you know.
M:	It
A:	I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.
M:	Heh, yeah, you can't.
A:	Go ahead.
M:	She smiles and puts her hands on her hips
A:	Exactly.
M:	You're not the one who needs to study.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I think they're saying too.
