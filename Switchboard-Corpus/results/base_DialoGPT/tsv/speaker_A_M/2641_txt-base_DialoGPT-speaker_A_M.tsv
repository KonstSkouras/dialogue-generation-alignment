M:	I had a cat.
A:	so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around, I like them.
M:	I'm not used to cats around
A:	Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all
M:	I'm not.
A:	Yeah, probably, I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid, in fact,
M:	... are you okay?
A:	I may still be, um, we,
M:	I don't think so.
A:	That , um, I wonder sometimes
M:	I don't think I'm a cat.
A:	Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything, we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday, it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog. It was like, oh, that could be it.
M:	I'm not allergic
A:	Yeah. Well, dogs are real high maintenances, you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot, you know, you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing.
M:	You '.
A:	Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know, all cats are indoor cats,
M:	,,
A:	so, you know, they're not, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,
M:	Why do
A:	yeah, it's, you know, it's a pain to clean but, you know, we used to, I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans . They didn't,
M:	...
A:	Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time, and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible. But now they have like this, you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
M:	
A:	and you, and you, you know the,
M:	you, '
A:	Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it away, and that's it,
M:	pull it, it's, it,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm just joking around, I'm not a cat
A:	Same idea
M:	We used to put newspaper on our cats'feet and then dump them in the garbage.
A:	Everyday?
M:	I have to clean the pan everyday
A:	Oh, okay, I see.
M:	I was using a different one
A:	Uh-huh.

M:	She's so kind.
A:	Oh, except the kid, huh, that's ,
M:	Well, we have the dog right now.
A:	Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, yeah, we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
M:	Yeah,
A:	and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really, I mean they're, they're happier when we're around but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves, um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
M:	...
A:	Well , that's, That's, um, pampering the, the petals
M:	i
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	,, and.
A:	But they're not that much fun, you know, you can't take them for a walk, you can't, you know, they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
M:	I think they
A:	they they can't do anything, so I've never, I think we had fish when I was a kid but I don't,
M:	Do they have any idea what they are doing?
A:	Oh.
M:	...
A:	Oh.
M:	The fish
A:	Oh.
M:	I did.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, I don t.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	He was a pet.
A:	No, it's like, I just, I don't know, I, I just never understood why, what the attraction, I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything but I've just never seen the attraction of having fish. It's not as much fun.
M:	... You have a fish?
A:	an eel?
M:	No, it's a fish.
A:	Oh, now we really get sick
M:	Fish.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, I mean, the fish was in a cage.
A:	Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha, and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in
M:	They do, and they're delicious.
A:	this is not, these aren't cats, you know,
M:	I don't know, but I don't like to think of them as such.
A:	this is gross.
M:	Oh look, a cat.
A:	Yep.
M:	No, that's not what happened.
A:	Yeah, well,
M:	I guess it's not too bad if you know how to use it
A:	Yeah, well, a cat will do the same trick
M:	I have a cat and he does it for me.
A:	I had a friend in I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.
M:	A cat, a cat, and a cat.
A:	Um, I forget how she got it, but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it, I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department.
M:	Hehe
A:	Whoops
M:	...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a feeling this is gonna be a long story
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts, so .
M:	Oh, um, yeah, er...
A:	Yeah, rats are not my favorite animals in the world, but I could see getting one from birth and everything.
M:	You know, he's like, uh, not really.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You mean you had one?
A:	Yeah, I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they, they tell me the same thing.
M:	I'm glad I have cats, I don't have any pets, I'm a cat person.
A:	I just, again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be. I,
M:	It's funny.
A:	Okay.
M:	The joke is that I live in Manhattan, the only place I can't live is Manhattan.
A:	Right.
M:	Yes, they are.
A:	Oh people,
M:	What is it?
A:	I don't, oh, plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York, so, you know .

A:	we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.
M:	I'm not sure that's
A:	Of course, not.
M:	They don't have a law against horses.
A:	Hit the bags.
M:	you can't be the most powerful man in the world, if you are the most dangerous man in a parking lot, you're not doing your job
