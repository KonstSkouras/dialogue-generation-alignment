M:	You
A:	Huh.
M:	I
A:	Huh.
M:	
A:	Oh, well that's interesting.
M:	It's all good.
A:	Oh, my God.
M:	You pay a lot.
A:	Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
M:	I'm not a hero.
A:	Oh, well, yeah
M:	It's a joke, I'm sure he's joking.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You are.
A:	Well, not, not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for.  I'm an engineer.
M:	I don't, I don't even know what to do.
A:	And,
M:	I have a kid
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, yeah, and it's a good thing.
A:	Yeah.
M:	We,
A:	Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.
M:	Oh?
A:	That's incredible.
M:	No, I was the teacher for the high school.
A:	Oh, oh.
M:	Well, it's been a while.
A:	Well.
M:	I'm not even a girl.
A:	Yeah.
M:	A lot of women in the UK.
A:	You know,   they could,  somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know, that's a good starting wage
M:	But they do.
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
M:	It's not the money that's the problem, it's the people who work and get paid.
A:	Huh.
M:	It's been like that since the first day
A:	I mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. But mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven so you know, that,
M:	I
A:	I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
M:	Baby siters are down at about six dollars an episode.
A:	Oh my.
M:	That's a good point. I just wanted to point out that a lot of people aren't even aware of the fact that they can get up to five dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is so sad. I can't imagine
A:	Oh, yeah.
