M:	I think it was the second time I heard of it, but I can't remember.
A:	Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes? Or just,
M:	That's a very interesting idea.
A:	Uh-huh. Um. Well.
M:	But, but, but...
A:	Yes, I know, the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent and, they want, I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
M:	What?
A:	I just, I can't see that.
M:	So what you
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hehuh.
A:	No.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it
M:	I don't think there
A:	it's really sad.
M:	But does it's sad.
A:	I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it
M:	Why? It's a very good movie, it's a great movie, and it's not like it's going to get better.
A:	with, someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know. Is really kind of bad
M:	I am.
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
M:	no.
A:	Oh, I don't know, is it, do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
M:	How is it really?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, that's the only reason I've ever had to use it.
A:	Um.
M:	Oh, is it?
A:	I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things. I don't know how I would feel about it. But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
M:	Why? How?
A:	Do you think most states have that or?
M:	I'm not sure. I don't know.
A:	That still does it, that's right.
M:	You
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, it's a felony.
A:	Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.
M:	I'm
A:	Uh-huh. So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through appeals.
M:	Yes, of, have
A:	Because I know they do frequently, I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
M:	Why?
A:	If it finally gets to that point.
M:	Do you think they'll ever stop?
A:	Yeah.
M:	So the appeal is for a while?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So is it, uh, are we doing lethal injection now?
M:	And the jury will decide that.
A:	Uh-huh, which seems so awful.
M:	It's a long story.
A:	So, it's a little bit more humane, I guess, it is,
M:	Yeah, uh, no.
A:	Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.
M:	Well, it's still a bit more painful than the other.
A:	Um.
M:	No, I don't think so
A:	Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
M:	Yes, it's because we are paying for them.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what they said, but it's because they don't have a problem
A:	Um.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Yes.
M:	So are you saying that they are going to be rehabilitated?
A:	Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it
M:	Not in the area I'm in.
A:	and, And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.
M:	Yes.But.Yes.It.is.up.to.now.If.But, the crime is down.
A:	You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
M:	I hate to be that guy, but what's the story with the number of murders in Dallas?
A:	But I, you know, we have been really fortunate our family, hasn't had any crime.
M:	It's not that I don't have any pride in my country, I just don't know how to feel about it.
A:	And, so we don't, it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.
M:	I'm not sure, but I know we have, so we've been really, really fortunate.
A:	And how they would expect, how they would hope,
M:	They wouldn't, they'd have, you know, the best of intentions.
A:	I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.
M:	Because the world is full of people that don't know how to do that.
A:	And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
M:	They have a law to prevent it from happening.
A:	So, maybe you would,
M:	I wouldn't
A:	but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
M:	I'm not a judge
A:	No, I know when, um, we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,
M:	What do you mean, we don't know?
A:	just like constantly, it seemed like,
M:	It was like, a lot of times, uh, times.
A:	but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.
M:	uhh, yes, uh
A:	And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,
M:	Well yeah. I mean, it's pretty much a right.
A:	it's just that, I didn't, I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
M:	I don't understand why you didn't go to the jury, if you did you would have been in charge.
A:	And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
M:	I know. It's just, I don't really know what the other guy was thinking.
A:	That would be really awful.
M:	I would be so mad.
A:	Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult but, uh.
M:	I've been to a few of them, they are pretty good.
A:	I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.
M:	What is it?
A:	Anyway, well, you have a good day.
M:	A little.
A:	Thank you, bye-bye.
M:	You're welcome.
