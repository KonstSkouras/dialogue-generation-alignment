M:	I'm so you're not uh, and uh, we can you're
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know, right?
A:	Do you have a lawn?
M:	I don't think so.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	Oh, no, it's just... We have the same tree.
A:	Well, um, actually it, we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
M:	But what do we do up here?
A:	And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
M:	Well, um, we've had an idea for a plot, so I'm not too sure.
A:	and the roses have been blooming for two weeks, and the grass is, uh, this lush green, and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
M:	Oh, wow.
A:	But, um, you know, I just keep looking at, and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
M:	And, uh, I'm not afraid of your kind.
A:	But, and my garden, you know, my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
M:	I don't know, I don'know.
A:	the plants and,
M:	The plants grow,
A:	you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know, we'll have a freeze.
M:	I am so, so, sorry
A:	Well, that's it. Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January, and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it, and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
M:	i
A:	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
M:	Oh, we're.
A:	So, but yeah, it, it's interesting, and I enjoy gardening. My son does the mowing of the grass.
M:	Well, you're not wrong.
A:	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.
M:	I know, I'm sorry
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Oh, they help you.
M:	You
A:	Oh dear. Oh but that's nice, you know, I mean the peach tree is, is a start and,
M:	Well, it's not that bad.
A:	Right. What about tomatoes, aren't they pretty hardy?
M:	i'a '
A:	Oh.
M:	...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Oh.
M:	That's a thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm gonna go with, and then you can have a big pool of water.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'S. The.
A:	Well, I would assume, too, I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.
M:	huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I'm a little nervous about the weather too.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh. That's pretty cool.
A:	Oh, dear.
M:	yes.
A:	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
M:	Yeah, I'm a bit of a little.
A:	Oh, sure, sure.
M:	I was joking, I don't think that's the case.
A:	Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full
M:	I'm sure I'll be able to do something in a few years.
A:	And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list, but it's not off the list.
M:	Not in the list of people who are, but it is on the to do list.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, what?
A:	Oh.
M:	
A:	Right. Maybe next year they'll do better.
M:	You
A:	Okay, well, thanks.
M:	I'm not a huge fan of the new colors.
A:	It was nice talking to you too. Bye-bye.
