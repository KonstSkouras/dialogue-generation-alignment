M:	then,, that, and?
A:	Yeah, I can, I can understand that. I was raised in Oklahoma, and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh, yeah, the hunting and everything, and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all, and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it, but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs. Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing. But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight
M:	
A:	Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas, and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, and of course it was definitely there. So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. I don't know what the answer is. I know that it's scary, and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
M:	
A:	Well, it's very true.
M:	.Why.that
A:	It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.
M:	
A:	And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too. I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.
M:	I don't think so.
A:	Because even if you said, okay, you know, armed forces could have them, some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
M:	Why do that.
A:	That's very true very true. Who knows, we maybe want to overthrow the government
M:	...
A:	I know, if somebody doesn't do something. Uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?
M:	How, then.
A:	Yes.
M:	No. Yes.
