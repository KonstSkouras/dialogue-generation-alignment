M:	you can't have a golden retriever
A:	Instead of being carried
M:	I'm sorry, I don't understand.

M:	So you're saying they wanted something to do with the puppy?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a dog.
A:	Huh.
M:	She is so tiny.
A:	Yes, I've seen those. They're cute.
M:	That's what I thought.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I can't help but feel like this is an ad for a breed.
A:	Oh, she's about four. She's not completely pure. We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy. She looks like a she looks just like a Golden Retriever, but she's a little bit smaller. She's like fifty-five pounds.

M:	A retriever is a dog, not a dog.
A:	Yeah. She's perfect. Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
M:	What about her nose?
A:	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
M:	She's not really in any danger.
A:	but, but we love her anyway. She's just a lot of company to us. We didn't, we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer, but up until then, she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun.
M:	I'm sorry. I'm not really sure how you can justify that.
A:	Right. Oh.
M:	You are so cute.
A:	I bet it had a pretty coat too.

M:	Do you think you can get a lab?
A:	We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures, and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
M:	Is it a breeding problem?
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	Golden Retriever
A:	Oh.
M:	Golden Retriever
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm...
A:	Yeah. They did. I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before. We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other, we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.
M:	...
A:	And we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down. And one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling And that, was mine.
M:	You were the dog.

A:	Huh.
M:	It's a German Shepherd, so it's a breed.
A:	Wow.
M:	No, they were bred for temperament.

M:	The only one that I've ever met who can't be a dog owner is my dog.
