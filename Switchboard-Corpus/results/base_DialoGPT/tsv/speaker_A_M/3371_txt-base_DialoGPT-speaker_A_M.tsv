M:	That,
A:	We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.
M:	How much do you guys have?
A:	Uh, we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.
M:	We've got four bedrooms, because we're the one that got hit by a car.
A:	A, a bedroom for my mother, and, uh,
M:	We have, uh, five bedrooms, so we can have a room.
A:	Oh.
M:	I built a sun room out of a sun.
A:	Oh, that's great.
M:	Well, they're just a big rock.
A:	Well, this, this house is very comfortable. We've got two living areas and that, that's the thing I probably like the most about it.
M:	Oh, what's that?
A:	It's just one story. Yeah. It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
M:	That's a great home. I'm sure you've seen many stories about it.
A:	Um, we've been real happy with it.
M:	I'm sure you'll be happy.
A:	Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that. They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight and this is under something but,
M:	I'm guessing you're a roofer, right?
A:	No.
M:	Do you have a bridge to sell?
A:	No, we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
M:	Have you ever tried to use it?
A:	No.
M:	I don't know if it's that or not.
A:	We've been real lucky. So,
M:	I don't know, it's been a while since we've had a big problem with it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a gas and it's a natural.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	And caves.
A:	Yeah, I, I've heard a lot of people say that. That's for sure. Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood over the beams and things up in the attic and so that, has replaced it to some extent
M:	It's an attic
A:	but certainly not,
M:	You have a basement, it's not a problem.
A:	Uh, in parts. I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.
M:	You know, I've never heard of a room being able to be torn down.
A:	Yes.
M:	Is that a thing?
A:	Yeah. Yeah, we, uh, we've got, you know, I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
M:	We've got some of the best presents in the world.
A:	Two living areas. We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
M:	Do you have a bedroom or do you have your own living room?
A:	and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.
M:	We have a bedroom, and a bath.
A:	In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that, you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house, but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have
M:	Ugh, I love that!
A:	I think that's true.
M:	There is a house in the play room
A:	Yeah. Probably our family room is the, the biggest. Uh,
M:	Oh. Well, I have a room.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I think they are.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, uh, can I come?
A:	Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
M:	They are.
A:	but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
M:	I don't like that...
A:	So
M:	It's always nice to see a family that's straight and straight
A:	Seventeen years.
M:	How long have u been in the church?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's been a long time
A:	Oh, wow.
M:	I am.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	I don't like the shape of that.
A:	Yes, it is.
M:	Are you the building on the right?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But... but... it's slab.
A:	Well, that's interesting.
M:	You can't.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you work in a basement?
A:	Uh-huh. Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway. That's his, that's his,
M:	They build it in the same way they build the house in the movies.
A:	worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
M:	I think he's saying it's a good thing he didn't have to do that.
A:	So,
M:	It's not really a bad thing.
A:	Well, uh, that's great. We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit and then he does all the repairing, you know, he does
M:	hmm, yeah, well, uh, you're just not a good, uh...
