M:	I'm here.
A:	Uh, I play the piano
M:	What's the music?
A:	and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano. He does that, uh, musically, listens and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.
M:	Well, what do you do?
A:	I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
M:	He's a weird guy.
A:	Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man.
M:	Uhhh, what?
A:	Yeah, and that's lots of fun.
M:	Yeah, we have a lot of fun in music too
A:	Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.
M:	So what's the story?
A:	And so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band.
M:	The actor who played the doctor was a child, so they were the child actors.
A:	So, yeah, it was really fun, and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school, and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.
M:	Did you go to school?
A:	But, uh, we just really like music. It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off, we get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music.
M:	I love it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, uh, I don
A:	Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki. Which is an auditory type learning experience.
M:	What do you think?
A:	You listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.
M:	Uuhhhuhuhuh. Uhuhuh.You listen, uhuhuh
A:	I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano, but he can't learn like that. He's a delayed child. He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
M:	Ohh.
A:	And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand, we went, wow
M:	
A:	we better have him do do something. You know, educationally.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	So that was really fun.
M:	We are, uh, um, friends.
A:	My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
M:	You're not.
A:	So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas.
M:	The music is the best part.
A:	Um.
M:	I am the most beautiful person in the world.
A:	Oh, I think that's great.
M:	It's why.
A:	That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something, they go, I don't want to do this anymore and you're like God, I really want you to do it.
M:	N
A:	You know.
M:	I don't think you should, but, I
A:	So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when, but, I don't know, if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's awwwww
A:	That's like me.
M:	You.
A:	Well, it can get expensive
M:	Well done!
A:	that's for sure.
M:	I guess so
A:	I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out.
M:	You know what, that's a good point.
A:	Yeah, so it's been good for our family.
M:	What about your family?
A:	I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,
M:	Uh, have you ever had a Suzuki student?
A:	Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will
