M:	I'm sorry to hear that.
A:	And I spend most of my time carpooling
M:	And we have a daughter
A:	The story of my life
M:	I have no idea what that story is about.
A:	My kids are involved in sports. My daughter has played basketball for six years, and my son plays football. I, my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
M:	I have a rule that my daughter can't be involved in any sports. I have to get her out of the house
A:	Yes. I know, I know. The insurance.
M:	It.uh, uh
A:	Yes. My son, is in both band and scouts too.
M:	You
A:	Oh, gee.
M:	You.the.what.
A:	Right.
M:	It's not really, you know, fun
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know what? We can.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Uhhh, uh
A:	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg .
M:	I would have guessed a game called mahjongg
A:	Have you?
M:	I've heard that.
A:	Well, it's really fun. Um, one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it, and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
M:	I have never played it, but I've been meaning to
A:	And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, and they both enjoy it. So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
M:	I don't know how you got to play this game.
A:	So, uh, we play that a lot of them, and, uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
M:	
A:	We have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
M:	You have family?
A:	So, that, and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
M:	I have family in the state of Texas.
A:	My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping. So that just kind of works out real well.
M:	I like camping. I don't go to the campsite.
A:	And, um, I'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too, so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
M:	Well, yeah.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Are you just gonna go and visit the museum?
A:	So that gives us special time together too.
M:	I'm a kid.
A:	And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so I can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too  so.
M:	It's not like she's a teacher. She's just a student.
A:	Yep.
M:	Are you a teacher?
A:	Yeah.
M:	So? It's a little different.
A:	Right.
M:	It's
A:	My husband has taken us to work with him, and we still don't know what he does.
M:	you, i, but, you, you?
A:	So, we just say he travels a lot. So, that kind of covers it.
M:	He's a professor.
A:	Yes. Yeah.
M:	You know, I don't really know the guy's personality. He's a pretty nice guy, but I don'know what it is.
A:	He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
M:	He said he's going to do it.
A:	Yes.
M:	So... He's been here for nine months?
A:	So those are the real killers. If he's just gone,
M:	Yes.
A:	he's gone three weeks right now and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,
M:	He's gone.
A:	so we just, you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. And something major, always needs to be done.
M:	I'm in the same boat.
A:	So you just have to, to handle it until he gets home
M:	Well yeah.
A:	And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
