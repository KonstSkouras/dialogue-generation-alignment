M:	Hehehehe
A:	Well, what about the idea that one is only guilty, uh, when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt? I thought that was the point of, uh, a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt.
M:	No.
A:	But, if there are some people who don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
M:	U
A:	Really? Have you served on a jury?
M:	That, uh.
A:	I never have either, but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just the opposite They say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. And, uh, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to, to air, and all that.
M:	well
A:	Right, , they don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
M:	
A:	And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that, if I were let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.
M:	
A:	I'd be, I mean I'd be tried by a jury of you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things, and, uh, I don't know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	I, I get a little bit nervous about it, and, uh,
M:	...
A:	Yeah, I, I was called once, but I was out of the country, and apparently I, apparently they thought I served so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it I came back and they said the record showed I served, but I was out of the country at the time, so I'm pretty sure I didn't. Uh,
M:	So
A:	Yeah, well, I I, I don't know, I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know,
M:	not
A:	And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury,  a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,
M:	I
A:	that's hard to say. Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
M:	Ah, um
A:	And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I, I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. Let's, let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
M:	
A:	So, not, I, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury, but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be,  things like that.
M:	I
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh. Well, how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow? I wonder if that's possible? I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
M:	Well, I guess
A:	They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
M:	I wonder how much money they pay to the judge.
A:	He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
M:	He's not a judge.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	What about a twelve people?
A:	Oh, of course. It's, it's political maneuvering. The, the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang everyone, and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic. They're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror. *whose who's Neither side wants that. They want to find a juror that's going to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
M:	
A:	Uh, I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually. I mean, I know, it, it, it's tricky because I know, you know, an awful lot of intelligent people who just, well I'm too busy to serve on a jury,
M:	...
A:	so I'll tell them that and they won't, or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
M:	You
A:	they just say do you believe in such and such. Uh,
M:	You know, you know.
A:	Right. Course, they'd be, they would be barred, but
M:	Well, they are
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury.
M:	Ohh...
A:	I hope we're called up before too long.
M:	Well, I hope you get to serve on the jury.
A:	They will, they will eventually. Okay, well it was nice talking with you.
M:	Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were the one that asked me to go on the mission.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	Goodbye to you too
