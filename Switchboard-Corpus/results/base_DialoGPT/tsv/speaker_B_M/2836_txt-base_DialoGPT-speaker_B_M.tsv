B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hmmm... that's what I thought.
B:	Uh, where I live now it's, it's not so bad. I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it. Uh, but I do have friends that live in the city and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.
M:	
B:	I live out in the country, yeah.
M:	I mean, I live in, live.
B:	I'm about fifteen miles out.
M:	Are you...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Where are you from?
B:	Um.
M:	I'm in Dallas.
B:	Um.
M:	That's because you are.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We don't have any crime statistics.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I wonder if they ever come back.
B:	Wow. That's huge .
M:	I live in a neighborhood that is a couple hundred miles away from the neighborhood that the neighborhood is in.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	How is it?
B:	Are there, are there any theories on why this is happening?
M:	It makes me laugh every
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, I would think it would be at least five in the evening.
B:	But why? Why is it happening?
M:	I would say most of it is happening during this time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, it's not a common thing, but it's definitely a thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They're happening all the time.
B:	So they're professionals?
M:	You should have known better, the people who run the company are people who make the decisions for the company.
B:	Um.
M:	And what do they do?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ugh. Uh, you got a couple of them, huh?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I can't speak for the
B:	Um.
M:	Uuhh, what kind of guns?
B:	Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?
M:	I think there are much more people with guns than people with penny, penny ante.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M:	I think it's funny that they think you
B:	But, I mean, that's going to tend to, I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit. The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
M:	You can
B:	Right. They're doing that in our state, too.
M:	Are you guys not going to stop?
B:	So you think that would be a deterrent?
M:	And they're the sentence for the inmates
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.
B:	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
M:	The only thing that's stopping you is the mass of innocent people who are guilty.
B:	Right.
M:	I'm not sure about that.
B:	So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.
M:	That's a lot easier to do than you think it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yea, I'll have a better word for it
B:	Uh-huh. Huh.
M:	uuhuhh. You uh... uhh, you know.
B:	Right.
M:	uuhhuhuhuh uuhuhhuuhuhuuhuh
B:	Oh, wow. Oh, my goodness.
M:	He's a murderer.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But... uh... it's been like a year since I've been back...
B:	Uh-huh. Right. Wow.
M:	You know, two counts, one of each.
B:	Did you, did you sue him under the civil system?
M:	I did sue him.
B:	Did you sue him under the civil system?
M:	I did, and he still owes me.
B:	Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him
M:	I am not even sure if he has any idea what I am doing.
B:	and,
M:	He has no money.
B:	Yeah. Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.
M:	I'm sure they'll be fine, it's not like they'll sue you for it.
B:	But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
M:	I would not go to prison for a year.
B:	Yeah, that's too bad.
M:	I'm sure the insurance company has some insurance to deal with that.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Haha. I am sure they will be fine.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You mean like, they've been in prison?
B:	Yeah, I, I think that's Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I think you're confused.
B:	That's awful
M:	Yeah, I think so
B:	Gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.
M:	He was in jail, he didn't have any
B:	Yeah.
M:	You mean like the vigilante that gave you the ticket?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I'm saying.
B:	Oh, my God.
M:	And we have a lot of guns, you know, like a gun.
B:	Right.
M:	So they'll wait, uh, for someone to do it, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	This is why I always go to the bathroom in the morning.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, that's right, I'm not arresting everyone.
B:	Right.
M:	I'm gonna get my stuff, and you're gonna get your stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can't
B:	And that, that's a deterrent, too. If you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake
M:	I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to shoot anyone who isn't armed with a gun.
B:	here you break in, and you're going to get shot.
M:	I have a friend who's been living in a house for 2 years and he's got a gun.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Heh, the guy in the video said that he broke in.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's that?
B:	Huh.
M:	Well, that's a bit of a different story.
B:	Wow,
M:	You should check out the other ones
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... I'm from a town that doesn't have newspapers, so I'm not really sure what's going on here
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, the locals have a lot of people that live in the city.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uhhh... uh huh.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, I, I tend to agree with you. I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.
M:	You.
B:	And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship. And they lose their constitutional rights. You know,
M:	
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
M:	So.h
B:	I know, and I think, I think that's ridiculous.
M:	No, we just wanted to have a conversation
