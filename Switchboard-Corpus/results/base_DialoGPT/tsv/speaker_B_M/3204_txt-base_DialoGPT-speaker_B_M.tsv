M:	Yea, I'm a nurse.
B:	Right.
M:	I think he's talking about the other kids
B:	Oh, it's very difficult I know.
M:	Yeah, it's hard for me too.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhm... What?
B:	Right.
M:	It's unrealistic.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Ohhh uh
B:	Yeah, how old is she?
M:	Yeah, she's cool.
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
M:	Oh. Well, how old are you?
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
M:	I, uh, I'm not a nurse, I just do, uh... I don'know, uh.
B:	They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
M:	Are you from Missouri?
B:	And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
M:	I know, it's so sad
B:	So,
M:	They're, uh, sad.
B:	Right.
M:	Yeah. I'm not a big fan of them either.
B:	Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
M:	Well, if you can afford it, I think you can handle a little.
B:	So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
M:	No, I mean like, I'm not the only one
B:	I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
M:	If anything happens, I'll.
B:	So, uh,
M:	He's a little short for me, but I'm not a big fan of him.
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
M:	I don't think you can really say that, unless I'm missing something.
B:	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
M:	Well I don't think I can say I have ever had to talk to anyone.
B:	I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
M:	You just need to drop into the nurse home, and you will find them.
B:	They never go to see them.
M:	How many people do you know who don't have their own.
B:	I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.
M:	And if they are in the hospital, they go.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Awwwwwwwww nursing homes.
B:	Right.
M:	Yeah. But I'm not sure.
B:	Oh, I do too.
M:	Yes, I do.
B:	Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
M:	Or when the parents are real
B:	Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
M:	You, uh, I know.
B:	So.
M:	He was the governor of California.
B:	Anyway.
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	Right. Oh, it's tough I'm sure.
M:	She nods.
B:	Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.
M:	They'd have to have the family or friends to have any good care.
B:	It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
M:	What if I don
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, uh, if you don't feel you could do that then...
B:	Right.
M:	Well, I'm not sure what you're asking, but I don't think you need any help.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yup. They are there.
B:	Right.
M:	Like a... father?
B:	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
M:	I don't know, I'm hoping we could get a third person to do it, but I'm not sure.
B:	Well, anyway,
M:	... yeah
B:	We've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
M:	You're welcome, but I think you've covered my answer too well.
B:	Have a good,
M:	he smiles and hugs her again Thank you
B:	Have a good
