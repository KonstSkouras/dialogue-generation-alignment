M:	What do you think is the main reason for the current outbreak?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I was going for.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's funny because he's not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I like the way he says it.
B:	Huh.
M:	He said the same thing to the French people in Paris.
B:	Yeah. I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary. I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases, and, uh, I mean whether,
M:	...
B:	Yes.
M:	So? Is that why you have less money than other people?
B:	And, uh, whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
M:	... because, uh, uh.
B:	uh
M:	Uhhhhhhhhhh.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then part of it's lack of education. I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
M:	I don't think it's the same. I think the money would go to education, and the money goes to cancer research.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuh, I don'know if it, uh, is still going to be the case.
B:	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things. One is preventing the spread and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.
M:	,
B:	And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't have any opinion.
M:	Uhh, you're not very good
B:	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
M:	
B:	Yeah, well, you know,
M:	No, and
B:	t-, whether my dentist or
M:	
B:	and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes. And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not. Can't get it from mosquitoes. And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions, yes.
M:	yes.
B:	And I don't know that's true or not. I mean, I just heard it in passing, but so what does that,
M:	I don't.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
M:	I work with him and shake his hand
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's not a virus. It's a virus.The same thing as the flu virus.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's wrong with that?
B:	No.
M:	So did the UN
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Oh.
M:	You know.
B:	I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
M:	We do know that the effects of it are very much different.
B:	I, I, give me cyanide. I mean, is it )),
M:	It's not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, yeah, but if I had a gun, I would still have it.
B:	Ri-, Exactly.
M:	Are you sure you are dying?
B:	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
M:	I'm not going to answer that question, you're not the same guy.
B:	let them, do it.
M:	Exactly. It's not like they're the only ones who can do it.
