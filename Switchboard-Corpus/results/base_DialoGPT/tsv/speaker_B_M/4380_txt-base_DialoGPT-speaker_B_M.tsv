B:	And I,
M:	Oh, and I?
B:	Okay Uh, I've, the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also. And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You are you not in the school, you know?
B:	What
M:	Well
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	And
B:	Yeah.  And I'm also  I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. More than they would you know, in areas where they
M:	I think that's it.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.  That's true.
M:	Your words
B:	Right.
M:	I don't
B:	Yeah.
M:	What?
B:	That's hard for me to say since I didn't, I didn't really grow, well when I went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area but I still, I mean, I learned to read, started learning to read when I was in kindergarten, you know.
M:	No, it.
B:	So I guess I can't really I can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region
M:	It's not like you can say what you would be if you grew up in the country.
B:	You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
M:	I mean, I know I'd be
B:	So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn and,
M:	I'm not sure, I think
B:	Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.
M:	I.
B:	No, I, I can't say that I have either. But, uh,
M:	I don't, but
B:	Yeah. I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.
M:	Nope.. Uh.
B:	If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools.
M:	Private school.
B:	I think they compare you know, fairly well.
M:	Not really, they don't compare you in any way.
B:	Yeah. I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there, I have a lot of once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
M:	Ya '
B:	That, I mean, that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Four levels.
