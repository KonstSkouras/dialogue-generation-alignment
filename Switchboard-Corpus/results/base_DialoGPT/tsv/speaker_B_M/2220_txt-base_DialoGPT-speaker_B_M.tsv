B:	Uh-huh. So you like a, a variety.
M:	A. A. B. C. D. A.A. D.A.D.
B:	Sort of easy listening because you like country but then,
M:	I like country.
B:	Um.
M:	They're both.
B:	Oh, uh-huh. Yeah, I, I like some of his songs, though. They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. They're just kind of sweet sometimes.
M:	Yeah, I love him.
B:	You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know
M:	It's a song, I don't care if it's not the typical Country song.
B:	Yeah, my truck's broken down and my house just burned down, you know.
M:	I'm sorry, I just feel bad for you.
B:	But,
M:	The story of my life
B:	No.
M:	Is there a guy who can play piano?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He's dead.
B:	Are, are you, do you play the piano, is, or you just like it?
M:	I'm not a piano player.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So you like it?
B:	Yeah, it must be fun to be able to play it and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.
M:	Nah, yeah,
B:	because I mean, I play the flute and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh, I like classical music just because of the, when, I, I don't play, I like jazz music but
M:	that
B:	What's that?
M:	I don't know, I like the flutes, I just like jazz.
B:	What's that?
M:	... and what about jazz?
B:	Yeah, I like a lot, like, I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the, I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection.
M:	I love this song so much, it's the only song I don't like
B:	Yeah, I love those, too. They're just so relaxing.
M:	I love them
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't really like the sound of the new album, but I love the new one.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Ohhh, that's awesome.
B:	Isn't that nice. I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,
M:	No, I'm not. I'm just very, very happy.
B:	and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, but, it, it's mostly relaxing and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or, but, uh,
M:	What?
B:	Yeah.
M:	How about what?
B:	Yeah.
M:	It
B:	Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying.
M:	I'm not a fan of that song.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, he is a child of a god.
B:	I, I can't identify them either. I just like them. I could, I know which ones come next, but I don't even know their names. Most of them I don't know their names of the song, but I, I can identify them. But I like that and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music.
M:	Nah, I'm not really that good at music.
B:	And, uh,
M:	Yeah. I think he is.
B:	I was in the band, yeah
M:	You know, I've been to a lot of shows.
B:	and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff, so I'm used to pieces and, and I played classical flute, I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, so. I I can relate to it, I suppose But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too, because I like Chicago
M:	You were in the marching band, right?
B:	and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh, you don't know Hebert Laws, but Hebert Laws a flute player, he's a jazz flute player and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione, do you know who Chuck Mangione is?
M:	...
B:	Yeah, I like Chuck Mangione Trying to think of all, uh, oh, what's his name, plays the trumpet. Yeah.
M:	I'm
B:	Yeah, I like Moody Blues. I, I like mostly the older groups I think. Oh, but we do have, I like Simply Red, we got Simply Red. I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like And, uh, I like Breeze, I like the group. I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh.
M:	Red
B:	No, it's, it's got people singing, but it's it is instrumental. But it's, it's got people singing but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing.
M:	But, and, and.
B:	You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the he can't hear me. I, I don't remember how many people, but, it's, it's got men and women and it's not, it's, it's nice, I mean it's pleasant, you know, music. It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything.
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't.
B:	Oh, you must live in this area.
M:	I'm.
B:	We're in Sherman.
M:	What area are you in?
B:	Oh, okay. You're going to Commerce?
M:	A friend of mine is going to be there.
B:	For East Texas or something?
M:	He nods. Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	Yeah, yeah.Yeah.Yeah
B:	Oh, okay. Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. That's why I was just
M:	They don't have any other schools.
B:	Yeah, East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester
M:	East Texas
B:	and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
M:	They're the biggest recruiting program in the state
B:	No more, huh.
M:	We'll be getting a few recruits in the spring, but they're a little out of the loop.
B:	Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant and that's what I know, so, and, uh, just nothing basically
M:	What do you know, huh?
B:	No, no, it, no I don't go to East Texas. I got a degree from T W U, but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, but I don't want to be a lawyer so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant.
M:	So?
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	I
B:	Yeah.
M:	Not ahem.
B:	Yeah, that's how it works.
M:	It's the same with all of them, and you just have to say the names.
B:	And this is the man that was in front of you?
M:	
B:	Oh, well they'll, weed him out.
M:	N
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He'll be fine.
B:	Well, not necessarily
M:	So, what are the requirements for a moderator?
B:	but there's probably something else that might make you. Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury.
M:	I would like to know that too
B:	I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. So but,
M:	I
B:	Yeah, so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,
M:	No
B:	because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment. So,
M:	It
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I said.
B:	Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,
