B:	Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
M:	It's a.me '
B:	So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
M:	We do.
B:	And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
M:	Ah, uh, it's a story.
B:	It's, uh, pretty nice. Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
M:	So, uh, what's it like?
B:	Yeah. It was a, Landmark is the one who built it.
M:	I know who you are.
B:	Yeah. That's true.
M:	It's a pretty nice place to live, but you can't live there forever.It's a paradise.For now.
B:	Exactly what happened to them.
M:	I think you mean that's what happened with the Germans.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
M:	They are all home made.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	It's going to be a fire.
B:	Are you doing it yourself?
M:	I don't think I can afford to buy a house with all that.
B:	Wow.
M:	Not much.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
M:	Yeah. It's nice.
B:	Oh, I see. Huh.
M:	He was a builder.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Did you ever build a house?
B:	That's great.
M:	Yes, we do.
B:	is that so?  I didn't know that.
M:	Yeah. I mean, I could build a home.
B:	Well that sounds kind of dumb.
M:	Because it's a loan and you can borrow money from people to build houses.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think it's just for the sake of it.
B:	Yeah.  Yeah.
M:	It's a bank, so it has to be a bank.
B:	Huh.
M:	It's a bag.
B:	That's right
M:	I've got a few of those.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	You can't really save the money, you can only borrow it.
B:	Uh-huh. That's good.
M:	It's not a bad place, just a little busy
B:	Yeah.  How big a lot do you got it on?
M:	I do!
B:	Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.
M:	I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere.
B:	Oh.
M:	Yeah. It is.
B:	God. That's pretty good.
M:	I'm at the top of the hill.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The weather is pretty cool.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Are you talking about me?
B:	Oh, that's pretty good.
M:	Yes. Yes.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
M:	I'm not planning on putting anything in it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, well, I'm not planning on putting anything in there.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uhh, uh, I think you mean a wood stove.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We'll use wood burning stoves, of course.
B:	Wow.
M:	It's not too bad.But I've had to put my laptop in the hot tub to keep it warm.
B:	Yeah. That's pretty good.
M:	It's not the heat.
B:	Yeah.
M:	A lot of them.
B:	Wow.
M:	It's the eastside.
B:	My wife would love that
M:	I'd love to see a picture of a glass window.
B:	She loves lots of windows. That's great.
M:	I know, she's like a million times more beautiful than I am.
B:	Is it a single story?
M:	Is that a single window?
B:	Oh, I see.
M:	It's a window.
B:	Uh-huh. Um, I see.
M:	Is it just me or is the second story on the left a bit high?
B:	Oh.
M:	It's a bit of a joke.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
M:	It's a little like a store in the middle of the street, I think.
B:	Yeah. I, I've always liked that. The, you know, I, we don't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back.
M:	I think that's the one.
B:	But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
M:	It's a big problem, isn't it?
B:	I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
