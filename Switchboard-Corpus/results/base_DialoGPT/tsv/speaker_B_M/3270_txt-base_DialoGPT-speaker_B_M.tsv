B:	Um,
M:	I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but it's a terrible idea.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Oh, which state is that?
M:	State of the art.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	State of Minnesota.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is one of the ugliest, most bizarre, most confusing, most nonsensical, most ridiculous, most annoying, most disturbing, most incomprehensible, most hilarious, most
B:	Right. Right.
M:	They might.
B:	Yep. Right.
M:	The military, uh, finds
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think you are talking about the military.

B:	I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	A big crunch.
B:	Well, that's right. Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste
M:	Because, uh, politicians don't talk about waste.
B:	but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
M:	Uuhh. Uh, it's not like they are doing anything.
B:	I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles.
M:	Because it costs taxpayers millions in military spending.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But the USA never did
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	It's not really.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	No.

B:	Bye-bye.
M:	See you later
