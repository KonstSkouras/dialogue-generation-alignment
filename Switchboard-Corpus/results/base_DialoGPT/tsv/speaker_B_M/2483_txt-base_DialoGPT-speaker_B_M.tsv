M:	How many of them were students?
B:	I rely primarily on, uh, newspaper combined with television.
M:	You, news.and, news.
B:	Uh.
M:	...
B:	Okay.
M:	It's not like it's hard to
B:	That's rather interesting.
M:	Hehehe's.
B:	I'd, I'd have to say I haven't either.
M:	Not.
B:	I listen to the radio, uh, probably five or six hours a week, but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical, uh, station here ,  for music purposes.
M:	 helicop.yes..
B:	We don't use the radio as a wake up, we have our, a television connected to a, uh, uh, electronic alarm, uh, system that kicks in,
M:	
B:	and it comes on with C N N in the morning.
M:	And the music
B:	That we, we wake up to television news and, uh, uh, shower and dress, and whatever to that, and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together, uh, in a car, we, we chat at each other rather than, than something else.
M:	So...
B:	Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car, so we have the advantage of being able to, uh, read and drive although there seems to be, from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
M:	
B:	So, we, we rely pretty, pretty heavily, I think, on a combination of the, of the two. I also, uh, use, uh, NEWSWEEK magazine. Uh,
M:	I
B:	we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the, the, uh, news magazine of the year for us.
M:	
B:	and, uh, I read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other, you know, trade magazines, and, uh, uh, such as that, uh, where I might read the, the occasional social and even current event commentaries, and, and everything as diverse as A C M to, uh, uh, some of the, uh, some of the other tabloids I get. So, uh, I guess I use about eighty percent written, is probably my input and twenty percent, uh, television. I, I think I respect the, from a journalistic perspective current events.
M:	
B:	I've always said that it, it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.
M:	.and,.
B:	Uh, other than that it was a at best.
M:	Then.
B:	Uh, we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh. There, there are other, uh, uh, I'm not sure what you would call them, they the small, uh, competing independent sort of newspapers. Little small weekly things, but there's only one daily, uh, called the NEWS AND OBSERVER, fondly referred to here by some as the, uh, uh, sometimes the Noise and Observer.
M:	...
B:	Uh, it depends. It, it's, has decent national coverage, but has an extremely focused political coverage, probably steeped in,  the southern history and the fact that this is a Democratic State.
M:	It's the?
B:	And, uh, consequently everything is filtered through that, uh, Republican Democratic sort of, glass, almost unnecessarily
M:	Local
B:	so.
M:	It's, uh, political.
B:	Yeah, we, we have, that is, uh, as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section, we, and we pay it sort of glancing nod. We, uh, have a very good friend who is, uh, tapped into the city planning structure. Uh, our developer architect friend and,
M:	I,
B:	Right. So, I think we find out what's happening in the city, uh, on a fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
M:	I think.
B:	Uh, and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than, than the paper would have anyway.
M:	You?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It
B:	Is that right? I'll heard there was some stuff on the, on the radio that was equivalent to C N N.
M:	I think it's the radio.
B:	Okay.
M:	C n N.
B:	Okay.
M:	I'll be back, I'll be around.
B:	Oh,  That didn't, uh,
M:	You.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not really, I'm,
B:	Uh, we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began. Uh, we almost live and, and breathed it for, because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done.
M:	N
B:	Uh, almost an addition, uh, and, and, and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in, in unhooking, uncoupling from the events, and going on with their. So,
M:	
B:	instead of being, watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. Uh, and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war, I guess about two and a half or three weeks in, we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would, uh, watch, uh, fifteen minutes before, fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news, or our local news. We would watch C N N until six thirty, then we would watch, uh, a rotating network news of either, uh, A B C, C B S, or N B C and we, we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.
M:	
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on, on news that way. And, then we would do a similar thing, uh, at uh, ten forty-five because, uh, C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage, uh, and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would, would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. Uh, three of the networks here, on their local news, uh, that if, if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who, murdered who, or stole what. from whom.
M:	:Yeah.adays.
B:	And, that was the sort of thing that I would say is the best MUMBLEx and not news
M:	.'s
B:	unless there's some trend or something that says, Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever. Uh, that's, that's sort of more of, of a pattern news.
M:	We.
