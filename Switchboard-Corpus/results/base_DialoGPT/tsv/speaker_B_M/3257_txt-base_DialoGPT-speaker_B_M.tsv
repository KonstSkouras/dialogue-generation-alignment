B:	Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.
M:	What are your favorite Mondays?

M:	Uhh... yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	That's not how it's pronounced.
B:	The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,
M:	u, uh,
B:	and there's a variety. Some of them is, uh, BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES, PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED? They, they rotate those around, and, um, we like that British comedy. British comedy is very fast, you really have to listen
M:	we,
B:	but.
M:	Yes, it is.
B:	They're real good, but they do come on kind of late, but we really do enjoy those. Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.
M:	Why are you watching them?
B:	And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there. But I'm very intrigued. I, one time I was watching an operation, and I thought, Gee, I don't believe I'm watching.
M:	It's on youtube.
B:	Yeah.

M:	I don't know, uhh, what?
B:	Yeah.
M:	...
B:	Um.
M:	It.
B:	Uh-huh.

B:	Um.
M:	I
B:	Yeah, the, you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
M:	I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I don't think I've ever seen any of those.
