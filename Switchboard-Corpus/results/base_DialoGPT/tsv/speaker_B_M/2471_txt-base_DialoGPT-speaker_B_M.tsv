B:	Uh-huh. Well that's,
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
M:	
B:	And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us, it seems to come in cycles.
M:	I'ma, we
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um.
B:	Right.
M:	I know, right.
B:	Right, and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,
M:	Is the...
B:	and their economy is, of several of the countries, especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable. It's just a, you know, such a small amount, and it it just, it, uh, cuts off just a trickle, and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, that will be another big problem.
M:	
B:	Right, right.
M:	That,
B:	And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.
M:	I,
B:	If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.
M:	You can't really cut back on the use of the market.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	Uhhh... that's the whole point of this map...
B:	we're just so much wealthier, and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,
M:	The world needs to stop being so unfair
B:	and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.
M:	Yeah, uh, uh.
B:	Yeah. That's right. Our own hemisphere, but we've, that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.
M:	It's been
B:	So, uh,
M:	
B:	Very much so, except when we need them. You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.
M:	I'm not sure if this is a joke or not, but I'm pretty sure it is.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And we've been there since the start.we're not friendly.
B:	Um.
M:	You know, in a recent war.
B:	Okay.
M:	He's a good guy.
B:	Sure did.
M:	Did you ever talk to the middle east about it?
B:	Always, yes ma'am.
M:	So, I'm assuming that you don't know about the middle east crisis?
B:	You too, dear.
M:	Have a good night
B:	Bye.
