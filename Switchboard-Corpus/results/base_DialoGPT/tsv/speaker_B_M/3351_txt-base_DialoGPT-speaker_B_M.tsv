B:	Tibby and Liberty.
M:	Are they?
B:	Tibby is the dog and Liberty is the cat.
M:	Tiberius is the puppy and the dog.
B:	Oh.
M:	They have a dog and a cat.
B:	Oh Ours are pretty calm.
M:	Ours are sooo cute.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, I'm just a dog.
B:	Yeah. Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. So that's why we call her Liberty.
M:	You're a lucky cat.
B:	Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
M:	I have a pet.
B:	I've had a skunk
M:	I love skunks.
B:	I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice
M:	You have had a snake, I've seen a snake.
B:	uh, let's see, I've had gerbils, I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
M:	What's your favourite animal?
B:	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
M:	You're not getting out.
B:	Yes
M:	Do you have a cat?
B:	it was litter trained
M:	Is it a snake?
B:	and we had it perfumed
M:	We had it lit up for a while.
B:	and, uh, it was very aggressive.
M:	Uh, that's not the only thing that's aggressive
B:	But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	You're right.
B:	And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	It was a dog and a cat.
B:	Nobody came near it when he was there.
M:	He got away with it, he had a good run.
B:	Oh.
M:	You know, the other day I was in the back of a house, and there was a dog.
B:	Yeah, they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them, but the glands had been removed
M:	Did they have to do this?
B:	so,
M:	He was very angry
B:	Right.
M:	So we have a dog and a cat, right?
B:	Yeah, I always said if I Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog
M:	I'm sorry I'm not like to talk
B:	That'd be the best way to be.
M:	I can't wait
B:	Well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia
M:	He is a little bit crazy.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
M:	He's a very big dog. He's only 8 weeks old.
B:	So, when he died, we got a little one.
M:	I'm sorry for your loss.
B:	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	She was almost a year old when we rescued her.
B:	Yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
M:	He had a dog?
B:	So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
M:	I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that it's not a simple matter of how many times we say it.
B:	And then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico now.
M:	I was gonna say it, but then I saw the name.
B:	Do you?
M:	I know, right? I think it's a little bit creepy.
B:	Um.
M:	You'av
B:	Yeah, well, don't even talk to me, I, when I was single I had gone away for the weekend,
M:	So, I, like, you, and, me, you

M:	I remember this, I was just in the same situation as you.
B:	And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
M:	I was, my cat died.
B:	Yeah, I found it, you know, in the street.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I was a social worker at the time, and found it,
