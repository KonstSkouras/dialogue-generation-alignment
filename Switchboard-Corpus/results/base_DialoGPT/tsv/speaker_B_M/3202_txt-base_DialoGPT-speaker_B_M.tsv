M:	I,
B:	Because I, since I came from, my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters. So I both of my parents had big families, and we always we always got together, just always. Now it's different because I live here and I, you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can but it's real different.

B:	And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.
M:	I'm not
B:	Right. I mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's and, you know, like I said there would be thirty, you know, thirty people, and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook.
M:	I'm in the day
B:	And
M:	I am the tree
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I came from Texas, and my mother was from Florida
B:	Yeah, I guess so. It really sounds like it was fun.
M:	Oh. I guess I was thinking of it as a family thing.
