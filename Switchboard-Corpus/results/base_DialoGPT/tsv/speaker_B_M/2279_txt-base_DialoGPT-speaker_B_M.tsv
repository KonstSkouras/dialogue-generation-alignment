M:	I am
B:	Um. Okay,  and did,
M:	I'm going to say yes, yes I am.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Are they?
B:	What, what are you doing?
M:	I'm sure it's fine.
B:	Oh, okay. Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball?
M:	It's an old joke, I'm sure they'll just give us a little description of the game and it'll be like, I know this game is called Baseball, but what's it's name?
B:	Okay, and, and in, in his league do they have like a pitcher, or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what?
M:	I'm not sure. They've played baseball for a while now.
B:	Okay.
M:	I'll be here until, the end of May.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	He's gonna be on the mound
B:	Yeah. I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York,
M:	Do you play baseball?
B:	so.
M:	Oh. So.
B:	Yeah, and how about, how about like on the weekends. Do you do sports or do you go out?
M:	I'm in the same boat.
B:	Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off?
M:	I do, but not for school.
B:	In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now?
M:	What time do you do your summer vacation?
B:	And where do you go?
M:	You can go to the beach, go to a beach, or go to school
B:	Have, have you been out of the country?
M:	Where do you live?
B:	Oh, okay, well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave,  I mean  I, I lived in places, like
M:	I live in the US
B:	when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial, and then when I went back to visit, I went to the Washington Memorial.
M:	What's the difference?
B:	Right.
M:	They're, they're
B:	Right. Well, it's, it's a beautiful city.
M:	Why?
B:	But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas
M:	Well, you can go to the museum and have a look around.
B:	and that was the most boring place on earth.
M:	I'm from Las Vegas.
B:	Yeah. Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?
M:	I know! I've been to Disneyland!
B:	Oh, okay. So, but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.
M:	I know, I'm a girl, and yes, I went to Disney World.
B:	and, uh, then after that, I, my sister lives in Turkey, so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.
M:	I go to school in Turkey.
B:	And this Christmas, I went to Turkey. But basically, it's a, for the past couple of years, I, since my parents are, are, well, I'm from Argentina, and my parents live down there. So, all the traveling I do is alone.
M:	Yeah, I'll leave
B:	And, uh, we were never much of, uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.
M:	...
B:	That was, uh, that was a lot of fun.
M:	I'm sure, it's been a long time.
B:	But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a family family thing. You know, one of those hell family vacations.
M:	I think you mean family.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You try to make it, we try.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Because, uh, we try, my mom is dead, you know, my dad was dead, and my mom's dead, I'm a dad, you mean.
B:	Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, so he could buy us material things.
M:	So why did you have kids?
B:	And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, but I still feel, you know, it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something
M:	Yeah, and, we never throw a football, but we throw.
B:	and the way I was brought up, and he wants me now, he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now
M:	I was raised by a woman, and I know how
B:	and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, and it's always the same man
M:	I, uh, don't know, I don't think
B:	and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best friends
M:	He has a friend who is like, 25 and he's the best friend he's ever had.
B:	but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. It's like, you know, I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know
M:	I
B:	and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together, and you know, his kids are, you know, when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach, and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know
M:	you.
B:	and, uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you have, just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up you know,
M:	It
B:	but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.
M:	But, he does, he's, he stays, stay, he, he' he, stay' stay, stay
B:	Yeah.
M:	you have to be in school to do that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You have a family?
B:	Yeah,  yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, what I'll do is, you know, like, I mean, you might have problems, but it's not your kids' problems you know,
M:	
B:	and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to, you know, like, thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know,
M:	
B:	and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,
M:	You
B:	first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know, and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yes, I'm, it's.
B:	Yeah, my, my father was raising four oh well, three kids before he had me, so it was, uh, you know, you're trying, to support, uh, four kids, and it's pretty hard you know,
M:	I, you,
B:	and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.
M:	I don't have any money.
B:	He says yeah, but then I wouldn't have you, I go, yeah, but then you would have a lot of money
M:	I'm not sure if I should say yes, but yeah
B:	Yeah.
M:	But I was told that I could have a much bigger family.I.could have been a lot richer.Thats why I have a family.It isnt really my fault
B:	But, you know, like, four, I mean four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition. I'm paying, you know, three thousand, no, what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.
M:	I'm paying.
B:	And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college, but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, it's like, what does it, what does it cost. It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose. Now they go to a state college and they live at home you know,
M:	No
B:	and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like
M:	...
B:	I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.
M:	Yeah,
B:	Oh, oh, excuse me?
M:	I'm not a student.
B:	Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.
M:	What kind of engineering are you doing?
B:	Yeah, and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
M:	I'm trying to get back home.
B:	because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina.
M:	Why not?
B:	Well, my dad wants me to go back. So.
M:	Yes, you do.
B:	No.
M:	I want to go to Argentina
B:	No, because if you go back there, then you can never get out.
M:	I'm going back to the future.
B:	Like you don't have any money to, to, get out.
M:	I don't.
B:	So, uh, and, uh, I was thinking, you know, like, Oh my God, you know, I go back there, and then, and I get married there, and now I have kids there, and then I'll never leave the place, you know.
M:	But you're married, so you don'have to go back.
B:	Yeah, I know, and that's, that's what happened to my brother. He came to school up here, and then when he went down there, he was just so bad off, you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain.
M:	...
B:	So.
M:	That's how you get.
B:	Yeah, I've been calling a lot of companies. There, some of them are interested. Well, at least for a year and a half I can work,
M:	Well, you're not the only one.
B:	so.
M:	It's been pretty good.
B:	All right, same here.
M:	You're right.
B:	Bye-bye.
