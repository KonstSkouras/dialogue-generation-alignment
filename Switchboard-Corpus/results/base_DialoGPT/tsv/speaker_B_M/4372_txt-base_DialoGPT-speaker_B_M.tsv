M:	sorry
B:	Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So I go outside the area for that. And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state. I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.
M:	they
B:	Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.
M:	pox. anyways
B:	Right. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden  shouldn't be placed on the consumer.
M:	,What.Oh
B:	Uh.
M:	That
B:	Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.
M:	I
B:	Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business.
M:	I,
B:	So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.
M:	N?
