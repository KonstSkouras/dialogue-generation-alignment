M:	They are.
B:	Yep.
M:	I like them.
B:	Oh, I think it would, it would be a lot of work but, um, you know, because it's, you know,
M:	No, I...
B:	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff but, but I think they're really neat and, you know, I think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
M:	I, think, you, know, I, don't.
B:	Oh, yeah
M:	the, is the word you're looking for.
B:	Right. Yeah.
M:	I guess I just have to scrape the watermelons out of it
B:	Is that, is that good? You know, I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but I've never tried it, are they really good?
M:	I'm not so worried
B:	Oh, I bet it doesn't mix well, does it?
M:	...
B:	Oh, well, that's good because I know they've been really expensive lately. Because they weren't in season,
M:	They've been, been.
B:	of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
M:	Wait, so they're the ones who
B:	Oh, is that right?
M:	Yeah, I know, I'm saying that they're expensive because of their origins.
B:	Oh, I .
M:	Well, the winter produce came from South American.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of winter.
B:	Well,
M:	How do you?
B:	Okay, sure,
M:	Well, I think I'll give it a try.
B:	Is that right? I've never heard of that.
M:	Pudding. I make it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I thought you were being sarcastic

B:	Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
M:	I just made a pie, it's delicious!
B:	Is that right? Oh, neat,
M:	You're.
B:	that is just really neat. Because I,
M:	I have a bunch of different kinds of pudding, and I just made a pudding for my own, so...
B:	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
M:	I would totally buy one of those
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is the first time I've seen a video that doesn't have a beter.
B:	So you put the milk in the cornstarch?
