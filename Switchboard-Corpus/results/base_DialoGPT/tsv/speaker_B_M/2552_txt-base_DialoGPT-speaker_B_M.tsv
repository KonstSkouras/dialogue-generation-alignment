B:	Right.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But of course, I'm not.
B:	Uh-huh. You must be a .
M:	you.
B:	So am I.
M:	He nods. So what do you want?
B:	Yes, what a coincidence.
M:	You're everywhere.
B:	Yeah, I know what family home evening's all about.
M:	Not anymore
B:	Uh-huh. Right, and then the family home evening, too.
M:	Well, that's not what I meant.
B:	Right. Well, that's good. Um, how many children do you have?
M:	Right, so, it's important to me.
B:	Two?
M:	Yes, they do.
B:	I have two daughters.
M:	How many daughters do you own?
B:	My oldest is, uh, four and my youngest is about to turn three. Two girls. And they are a handful
M:	Uh oh.
B:	Yes. We've, my, uh, well, when we first got married, my wife worked for a year. Then we decided to have kids.
M:	Well, they're a handful.
B:	And, uh, she, she got pregnant and then we decided she would stay home with the kids. We would make that sacrifice. It is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one.
M:	I love it!
B:	And, uh, we made that decision and, uh, so after she had the first baby, she stayed home. And, and we had a second baby and she's still at home
M:	
B:	And so, uh, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know, I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in. Most of them, uh, continue to work if they have, have kids.
M:	I,
B:	I only have one other person I know in my, in my group here that works where the wife stays home, and that's because of religious values as well. They're Baptists and they, and they think that's important.
M:	...
B:	But everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day-care and, and leave them and, I don't know, I just don't want, I just don't want strangers raising my children.
M:	...
B:	Right.
M:	So is the
B:	That's how it is at our house when you're on the phone. Oh, it's open, anything goes when mom's on the phone
M:	Is this
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ohhaha. So you...
B:	Right.
M:	I'm the kid's home.
B:	Right.
M:	right.
B:	Right.
M:	I read the books in the morning.
B:	With all the yard work and things like that.
M:	I wonder how many hours a day he spends in the office.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... I... I'm not sure
B:	Uh-huh. Right, we feel that, you know, just spending time together. You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, you know, that costs money or, or, you know, that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that. It's just the kids like to, being together as a family.
M:	...
B:	Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run and so we took the kids and, and went by the Farmers Market down in, in, down there in Garland.
M:	We
B:	And they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the, you know, the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out. And they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet, you know,
M:	...
B:	and they liked that. And then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an F A, F A A, Future F A, Future Farmers of America, F F A going on there,
M:	I
B:	and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in this, in the, in this schoolyard there. So we just said, hey, let's stop and and the kids got to go around and, you know, see pigs and animals and things like that,
M:	There,
B:	and, and for them that's wonderful, you know. They, they thought it was the greatest fun, you know, and it didn't cost any money. And, uh, you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.
M:	We,
B:	Right.
M:	...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's not.
B:	Right. Right. Oh, definitely motherhood is devalued in this society. If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's like what a waste. People think, you know, you should be fulfilling yourself
M:	I don't, I'm a woman.
B:	and, and a mother isn't an important important thing as, as having a career
M:	Because, you know, you're an important, important person.
B:	and, and that should be first and, and children second. But they don't have kind of an, what we call an internal perspective of things.
M:	You mean like, if you have a child, you have an internal, internal perspective?
B:	But that,
M:	And, the, and
B:	No. Right.
M:	No. Right.
B:	Uh, at this point.
M:	Well I, uh, I don't know.
B:	It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work. My mother's a school teacher and when, when we started, uh, having kids, she had to work for a little while, but then she just started substituting.
M:	Yeah, that's what I meant.
B:	So she would just substitute once or twice a week, you know, just for that little extra money when we were in school. Then we would just come home and just be, you know, go to a neighbor's house for an hour, then she'd be home. But she wouldn't do that every day.
M:	Every day
B:	But now that my, my, uh, youngest sister's at B Y U now, and so they have no one at home, she's back teaching school full time now, again. So if, you know, it's not, it's just a temporary thing.
M:	N.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I see, well that's good.
B:	Yeah, yeah, you, it's, it's hard sometimes at work because, you know, people say, oh, we're taking a cruise, we're going here, we're going there, you know because they have a lot more money.
M:	Well, you know, I'm not a crazy person.
B:	And a lot of them decide just not to have children.
M:	The world is full of people who don't have kids.
B:	It's, it's amazing, they either have one or none.
M:	The kids.
B:	And, and the one person I know that has one, they, they feel guilty. She has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing, and so on, uh, on weekends she would, you know, spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots of, lots and lots of money. Basically, I think they, they really spoil the child, to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings.
M:	lol
B:	And, and, and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think, you know, that, she doesn't think she could be a mother at home. That's not her bag. So she just doesn't think that she could, you know, the guilt feelings, she can't deal with with it anymore
M:	This, to,
B:	so,
M:	That, you, you?
B:	You know,
M:	I don't, she doesn't want to.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, my wife, uh, likes staying home.
M:	Well, I mean, you are the one who's the one, right?
B:	Uh, she works at home some, though.
M:	I work at home.
B:	The place she works with, worked with before, um, worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home, part time,
M:	Uhh, she works in a restaurant, part time, part of a family.
B:	and so, uh, that, it's kind of a seasonal thing. Three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business,
M:	That's good.
B:	but the rest of the time she's free. She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that So she enjoys staying at home, but, uh, the money part of it is not as rewarding, obviously, but there's different rewards, you know, different kinds of rewards.
M:	different
B:	Right, right, right. And you really have to make, uh, quite a bit of money. The wife doesn't make it worth it, with the cost of day-care.
M:	I
B:	I know there's, you know, when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care, you know, you're only making like five.
