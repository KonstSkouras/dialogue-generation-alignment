B:	Oh, boy.
M:	I am the child of the child.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I see.
B:	Are you? Where are a student?
M:	Good. I'm glad you're okay.
B:	No kidding.
M:	Awww. You should go to school for this.
B:	I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.
M:	It's an old meme.
B:	Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?
M:	Well, you know, that's why I was asking.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You're in school?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Okay, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I'm assuming it'll be a four to five hour week?
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	You'rein.
B:	Well, that's a good experience, I think, and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good and they kind of boil down to, uh, any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
M:	we're, they're'a.
B:	and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving
M:	We got it.
B:	and, uh, that's more important than anything else. We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
M:	We could have
B:	Uh, she goes to a home. This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives.
M:	What are you, uh, going to do, uh...
B:	They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
M:	Yeah, uh, uh.
B:	They've got three daughters. Uh, and, they have a loving home and, uh, they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
M:	That's odd.
B:	And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends,
M:	Uhhh. Yeah.
B:	so it's a good experience.
M:	I think it's pretty fun
B:	I if it's good, I think it's very good for the child.
M:	What about a nice and warm place?
B:	And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good and, and that's really what we've learned about it. She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
M:	It's a loving home, I think she'll do fine.
B:	but, uh, we feel real fortunate and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace. I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg.
M:	She's not a teacher.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	How about, uh, how do you feel about it?
B:	Yeah. I'll bet they're involved. Yeah.
M:	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
B:	Yeah
M:	They have a good looking, uh, child care facility.
B:	Well, that's, uh, I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
M:	I know it is.
B:	Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
M:	I'm gonna go to the, uh, library.
B:	So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
M:	I don't know.
B:	and I think this is really  is buyer beware.  Well, it is the best way  to do it, interestingly.
M:	Because I know that it's going to be an expensive process.
B:	I think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
M:	I
B:	Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.
M:	s
B:	Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
M:	Not.
B:	It's, it's phenomenal. It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
