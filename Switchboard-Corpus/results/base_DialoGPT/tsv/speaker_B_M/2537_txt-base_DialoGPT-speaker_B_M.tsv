B:	Uh-huh.
M:	...
B:	That's right.
M:	I'm not going.
B:	That's absolutely right. It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot, is, is definitely not acceptable.
M:	Haha.
B:	Uh, uh, I don't think anybody would ever argue that. Or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday
M:	What does it affect you know, uh, you know?
B:	but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, uh, see any results of it the next day.
M:	This
B:	Well, it, it is, it, you know, on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh, you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, it's a mark against them,
M:	...
B:	the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh,
M:	I,?
B:	That's right. That's right. Right. even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.
M:	I
B:	And, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there.
M:	Well, uh, there's
B:	I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, I never really thought of it that way.
M:	Oh, well, that's
B:	Yeah, if they really can,  um, I think the the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.
M:	You?
B:	Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned but, uh, not, nobody, no, I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh, It's just, it, it's a really tough question
M:	i
B:	and it, you know, it, people have, have really quieted down after everything started but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment.
M:	...
B:	Uh-huh. You bet.
M:	no
B:	No,  that's right.
M:	Oh, uh
B:	Yeah, I, I know of some people who did, uh, it was, it was indirectly related, you know, they could always come up with other reasons but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude, because it's really, uh, it's just really, it, it seems so T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have, um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot.
M:	i.
B:	You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, from what I've heard,
M:	It, I, you, or...
B:	but, uh,  yeah
M:	You've
B:	Uh-huh. No, I,
M:	uuh, you
B:	Absolutely not, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, if you hired me I'll be, you know, supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess.
M:	yeah, I, uh, think you're, you know, gonna,
B:	But, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. There's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play but that was, I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It
B:	I really don't think so. Yeah. I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, it may prevent, I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it.
M:	It
B:	Um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but, uh, I don't know if, you know, the, it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. There, there's still a big question in my mind that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing, is something that still bothers me.
M:	
B:	It, it's,
M:	,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I, and
B:	Uh-huh. Absolutely. And that, I, I don't know if, uh, I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was prescribed for you but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin, well, penicillin's not on the list but, you know,
M:	
B:	yeah, I, I think you understand what I'm getting at,
M:	I, you, you're, you are, you...
B:	it, it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and, and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent,
M:	That's what i'm the way
B:	and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.
M:	It's not really a negative.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uh, I'm not sure what you mean by that
B:	That's right.
M:	They don't have any left.
B:	That's right. I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,
M:	They're illegal.
B:	but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and,  that can happen.
M:	Yeah, and there's also the whole'you and there '.
B:	But, uh,
M:	Well
B:	Yeah, yeah, I think so
M:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
B:	You too.
M:	I hope you enjoy your day
B:	Good-bye.
