B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	It '
B:	okay.
M:	we've got 3.5 billion people.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	uhhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Huh.  Uh-huh.
M:	I think you can get the cash from the bank.
B:	That's true if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket. Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.
M:	No.
B:	Yeah, you think, well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money.
M:	This.
B:	But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,
M:	Oh, you have money
B:	Yes.
M:	Are you single?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Wait, how?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hahaha. Ok then.
B:	Huh.
M:	I think it's just her.
B:	Right.  Besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this ...
M:	I... I'm sorry?
B:	Yeah, this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time, you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.
M:	I'm sorry I don't get it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, it's a cash back gift card
B:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.
M:	I don't.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	you
B:	Huh.
M:	Uhhh?
B:	Service charge you mean?
M:	I have to get to my car, so I'm going to be taking the bus.
B:	Yearly fee, yeah.
M:	Do you mean the monthly fee?
B:	Oh, you get that stuff in the mail all the time.
M:	It's not a big deal, you can buy it in the US.
B:	What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still, that they send you these things that look like checks,
M:	you.
B:	and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know, all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan. I hate it,
M:	.
B:	I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.
M:	I'm pretty sure they're using the same script for the credits.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. But it's a bit of a shame
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	ThatYeah.?They.adays
B:	Yeah.
M:	she
B:	Yeah, I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation and that, we think we need all these things and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know, like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't, you know, do without too much and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time. You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,  you know, going in one big swoop, save up and then buy it.
M:	II
B:	But we're not into that. We're into like, have to have it all now.
M:	yes
B:	Well, we're geared to that. We're like, okay, like I want a living room set. And instead of sitting back and, and going, okay, well, it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars and I'll save for two years,
M:	:
B:	people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.
M:	I
B:	People aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it, they just put it on a charge card, put it on account, and then pay off the bill because they want it now.
M:	
B:	It's always have to have it now.
M:	You can't buy a credit card with it, it's a credit.
B:	no, no, but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense. So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at, all now we're, we're, you know, we, I use it occasionally but I pay it right off. We're ...
M:	I
B:	Yeah, you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.
M:	
B:	That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.
M:	You
B:	And then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything, you're always just paying bills, paying bills, you know, you don't feel that you have any extra to save. And I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck. I like to have a little there, you know, that I can, save so I can feel that, you know, if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, .
