M:	I love cats and I love my cats, but I can't have any.
B:	Yeah.
M:	They're not married.
B:	I had a cat, I've had several cats. My pet, uh, was hit by a car New Year's Eve, but, uh,
M:	I think you have to have a cat to have any pets.
B:	I'm going to get another one as soon as I get back in town. I'm going out of town this weekend, when I get back I'm going to find a cat. So,
M:	She nods.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were going to say something.
B:	I work and go to school and it's kind of nice you come home your, your pet's there for you and wants a little food a little attention.
M:	work
B:	And that's, it's kind of fun.
M:	...
B:	Yeah.
M:	And they want a cat badly.
B:	No it was an kind of indoor, outdoor, it, it was,
M:	I don't think you know what that means.
B:	well yeah, I don't, I don't care for the smell of the litter box so my cat was trained to go outside, other than that it was inside when it wanted to be, it was outside when .
M:	It was outside.
B:	Yeah, I, I, think, you know, I like dogs, but I think that, uh, I'm, kind of like big big dogs and you have to have room for them.
M:	i'
B:	And dogs take a lot of, a lot more care than cats do. Cats are pretty independent, you know, you feed them and they keep themselves clean and, if you, if you raise them right, you know, you don't have to worry about the litter box thing, where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.
M:	but
B:	Yeah.
M:	I.
B:	Yeah, I got to take care of a friend of mine's dog. He's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet, so it was, go over there and clean up after the dog,
M:	That
B:	And, uh, kids kind of, they want the, they want the fun part and not the, not the work.
M:	So, what are the kids?
B:	Yeah.
M:	Pet
B:	Well if you're, if you're going to have a pet,  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to, you know deal with the consequences, take care of the offspring
M:	I'm
B:	and, and I think, you know,
M:	And, I think, you know,
B:	when I was growing up we had cats and, you know, just seeing the cats, you know, the, the miracle of birth, you know, put that in quotes, is that's a, that's a neat thing to, to experience as a kid and understand,
M:	
B:	and, and it was a real positive thing, but on the other hand you don't want to, you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road, you know,
M:	... and,
B:	they're, they're, getting old now, and it's time to get rid of them.
M:	You know
B:	So.
M:	He is so, so old.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Are you kidding?
B:	Okay,
M:	Yeah, I was just making a joke about how we are a small community.
B:	Bye.
