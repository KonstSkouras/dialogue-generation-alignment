B:	Um, well, the, see, uh, well, we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
M:	You?
B:	right, we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. Or but naturally, no, it was even Mennonite related, I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
M:	that.
B:	Uh, what do you think?
M:	no, i'
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's awwwwwww.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uhm... I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah
M:	So, did you have a choice?
B:	yeah, that's important I would say.
M:	You can always move her out of the house.
B:	Okay.
M:	I have a friend that works there. I'm sure she can give you a list of what she's doing and what she is doing.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yourself.She's
B:	Right, and that becomes difficult then.
M:	She's not there anymore.
B:	Uh-huh. Yep, we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life, but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
M:	I
B:	but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,
M:	I think.
B:	and this, eventually things just went too far
M:	I was not talking about that, I was talking
B:	and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.
M:	He was a very nice man.
B:	Right
M:	I'm not really a guy.
B:	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.
M:	I mean, the kids'parents have a responsibility to take care of them.
B:	And.
M:	She is here.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't know.
B:	Yep.
M:	... Is she?
