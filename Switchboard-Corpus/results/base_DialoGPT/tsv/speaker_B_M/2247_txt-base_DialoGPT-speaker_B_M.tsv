B:	It's eighty eighty-eight?
M:	You're a joke.
B:	Okay. Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously.
M:	The only thing that's different is that it's an English based site.
B:	Okay. Uh, I use them both here at work and at home.
M:	I don't know what you're talking about.
B:	And I have I B M clones in both cases.
M:	uhh, what do you mean?
B:	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
M:	There's a T I clone in the box that's the same thing.
B:	Yes, it is. Uh, unfortunately I need all of it.
M:	Is the GX clone a clone?
B:	Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
M:	This is how you get a million people to download it.
B:	And that, I know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
M:	I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.
M:	Well, it was a good game.
B:	And then I have, uh, a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.
M:	You have, uh, a twelve inch machine, in your bedroom.
B:	And I'm really pleased with it.
M:	Uhhh... so you've never heard of it?
B:	It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
M:	I'm really, uh, impressed with it.
B:	Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. Have you,
M:	That's what I'm thinking.Uhh, what about the tools for word processing?
B:	To try to make them more effective and useful.
M:	Um... um... what?
B:	Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
M:	Yeah. I've been struggling along that line lately.
B:	Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
M:	...
B:	The, at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from.
M:	
B:	Very frustrating. Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. You come here with the B level of specs?
M:	This.
B:	Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.
M:	I'm.
B:	Well, I sure need them. Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them.
M:	
B:	Yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. When you start seeing what all they can do for you.
M:	what
B:	Well, I understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
M:	You.
B:	Right.
M:	I was thinking of the future.
B:	Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
M:	I'm pretty sure the original was released in 2003, and the original version was released just a few months after.
B:	It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
M:	Yeah, but it's been out for a while now.
B:	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	I'ma
B:	Well, okay. I enjoyed our discussion.
M:	You're right, I was just thinking of it in a different way.
B:	You do the same.
M:	Ah, well, you don't know me.
B:	Bye.
