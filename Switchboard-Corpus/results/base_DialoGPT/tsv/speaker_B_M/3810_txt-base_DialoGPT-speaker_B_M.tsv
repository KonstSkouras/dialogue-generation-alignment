B:	So,
M:	So, how's it
B:	Um.
M:	You don't.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	u bealphem, the girl plays the piano.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, it's always been the song that he listens to.
B:	Oh, they did?
M:	I am the one who sings, my son.
B:	How did, How did they get involved in that?
M:	Well, we've got a lot of people who've been involved in the production of this song.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Did they read it in the newspapers?
B:	Oh, how fun.
M:	No, I'm married and my wife is a teacher.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Huh. I did not know that.
B:	Um, uh-huh, um. Yeah, yeah, that's nice. You say have your four year old taking lessons already?
M:	It's a good time.
B:	And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?
M:	Uuhuh, um.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, uh, have you seen my handwriting?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh yeah? Uh huh?
B:	Oh.
M:	Um, uh, yeah, I'm pretty good with piano.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can't say that, you know.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I can do that
B:	Well, because my,
M:	I'm a bot, you're a bot.
B:	Pardon me?
M:	It's been a while since I've seen a musical.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
M:	So what's your opinion on musicals?
B:	because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. She just,
M:	
B:	So I wasn't sure when to start her. I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
M:	I don't.
B:	Uh-huh Yeah.
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	She says, but she says no.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, I think she'd like to, I just don't know if it's really, knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
M:	Yes.
B:	It was something easily forgotten. So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or, or should I say seven. I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. She does have to really work at it, but, uh, so,
M:	
B:	Yeah, but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but,
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm not really, it's expensive
B:	Yeah.
M:	But you?
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, that's good.
M:	She smiles back.
B:	Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method, have you had any former Suzuki students?
M:	Well, I'm a piano student.
B:	I was wondering how,
M:	Because, I have no idea what you're talking about.
