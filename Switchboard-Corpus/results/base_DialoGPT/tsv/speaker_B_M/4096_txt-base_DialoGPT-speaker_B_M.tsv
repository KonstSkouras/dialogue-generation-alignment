B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, did you go to the E O?
B:	Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.
M:	Uhhh, uh, I didn't think that the EPUB was a thing yet.
B:	Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?
M:	I don't know. I'm just a little confused.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The E P a is a pretty new proposal.
B:	Yeah.
M:	...
B:	Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.
M:	.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is it
B:	Right.
M:	I don't
B:	Well, that's good.
M:	I've had a few people have said that they're not buying it.
B:	Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
M:	
B:	and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
M:	they are recy recycle
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	?
B:	Oh really.
M:	N
B:	Right.
M:	I was just joking
B:	Huh.
M:	Solar panels can't even do that.
B:	Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?
M:	But... carbon dioxide emissions are only a problem if you are burning it.
B:	Oh.
M:	I know that. I mean it's just paper.
B:	Okay
M:	I'll burn it.
B:	No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.
M:	Yeah. She's a good cook
B:	Did it change anything for you?
M:	I was just wondering
