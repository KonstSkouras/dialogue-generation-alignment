M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	Do you have any

B:	All right.
M:	No
B:	Uh-huh  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
M:	Yes, uh?
B:	Well, I'm an E S L teacher.
M:	What's your point?
B:	Yes.
M:	You're an English teacher?
B:	I got my certification. But actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
M:	Well, you are an E E S l teacher.Well, they teach you how to go around helping people learn another languages.
B:	I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,
M:	That is what I get for trying to understand the question.
B:	it's not step for step.
M:	They are. They have a lot of people teaching it.
B:	Yeah
M:	so... do they have a secret?
B:	But anyway, I enjoy it. They, they, the kids I've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking.
M:	I know. It's not even that hard.
B:	And
M:	They, they, they...
B:	but I'm applying for, What? Yeah, it is.
M:	It's not a language.
B:	A lot of our words are the same,
M:	So is English
B:	like, you know,  they just change the pronunciation a little bit.
M:	What? What?
B:	But, I love it. I love the culture, uh, the way that they, uh, they respect education and their teachers their parents, so much more than, than my children do. You know,
M:	That's the most important thing, we love the language.
B:	and I like it. And what I've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this, uh, Asian center that, a Doctor Falk has started, that works with the school district.
M:	I like
B:	And doing what, trying to get them set up, inculturated,  into the system.
M:	I'm a bit confused
B:	I thought that would be good experience for me.
M:	What are you doing?
B:	And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.
M:	We have a small one
B:	And I think that would be wonderful too.
M:	I've already applied for a job at a different district.
B:	Right.
M:	No, it's not.
B:	Well, the times were different too.
M:	Chinese and, and
B:	My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish. And he's going through the, I don't know, the Jewish League or something. And helping a family that's come over from Russia.
M:	What?
B:	And he spends, well, right now, he's down to like once a week, but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,  and help them with the language.
M:	... he's Jewish.
B:	And he thoroughly enjoyed it.
M:	I told him that he was getting downvotes.
B:	No.
M:	Is it a problem?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, you can.
B:	Uh-huh. What's so sad about this is both of the, the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but,  their training isn't what we need in this country.
M:	It's sad. I don't know why people don't use this as a reason.
B:	And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.
M:	uhh.uh.uh
B:	So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.
M:	They can't even get a job here.
B:	No, no. And this woman was, uh, stocking the shelves in a drugstore.
M:	Was she English?
B:	I feel sorry for her.
M:	What if the girl is a drug dealer?
B:	Well, thank you.
M:	It's fine.
B:	Have a good night.
M:	She hugs back.
