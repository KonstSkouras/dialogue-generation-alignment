M:	And it's, uh, what?
B:	Yeah, yeah, it's not good
M:	It's not like I'm gonna have any issues with it.
B:	And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice, they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,
M:	The government is a pretty good place to start.
B:	Right, uh-huh, Uh-huh.
M:	This is like a 2 by 2plex.
B:	Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
M:	That's, price.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's uh, nice to see the neighborhood that's been around for a while.
B:	Oh, my heaven.
M:	... a thousand dollars.
B:	Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
M:	I live in Texas and I'm so confused.
B:	But we like our area. It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything
M:	I've lived here for almost 5 years and it is the best place on earth.
B:	but, uh,
M:	It's a small place.
B:	Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh north.
M:	Well, we are not in Pennsylvania.
B:	And yeah, and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
M:	It's really only about a mile from Pennsylvania, I think.
B:	Bradford's north of us.
M:	We're not all from the north.
B:	No, no.
M:	I'm not that close.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry, but you're being a little...
B:	Well, we've been here since sixty-six.
M:	I've been around since the beginning.
B:	Uh, we have fifty acres.
M:	Well, uh, we have two, I guess.
B:	Oh, pardon me, we have forty, we gave ten to one of our children
M:	And we've got fifty, you've got ten.
B:	No, not really, and, and towns keep creeping closer and closer, you know.
M:	Do you ever feel lonely?
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	This is my
B:	Yeah, it's ours up here. We have, our rural connections are real bad
M:	It's a joke, you know.
B:	But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, you know, reasonable.
M:	I don't know. I'm in the south, but I don't live near any towns.
B:	Uh, yeah, we're tired of doing it though. We, we don't want to do too much more
M:	Are you sure?
B:	Uh, oh, golly, I really.
M:	You know, a lot of people do
B:	We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
M:	I have a panty, and a kitchen, and we have a bed, but I don't know what to do with it.
B:	and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh we, have a half bath downstairs, too.
M:	we have a bathroom, we have two rooms, we both have a floor, we had a toilet, we're all the same
B:	We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room And, uh,
M:	we have a toilet, and a bathroom
B:	Pardon?
M:	I know, but you can have a junk and a bath together
B:	Well, it really isn't too big yet. We, we a lot of people say that but, um, it's,
M:	I'm pretty sure it's a big deal.
B:	we just like it real well Yeah,
M:	I don't know, I guess I'm just a little biased
B:	we had five children, so and they've all moved you know, on.
M:	We have, it's just so far away
B:	They're all out on their own now.
M:	But they're all dead, right?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	A little.
B:	Well, it sounds like a good buy.
M:	It's not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's not really a good deal, is it?
B:	Oh, that makes a big difference.
M:	I have a lot of family that lives in Minneapolis, so I'm not going to be able to rent a house.
B:	Uh-huh. You really aren't isolated because it's, the advantages, your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people,
M:	Ummm, you're.
B:	but yet you can have your friends, uh, you can have them in, you can go out.
M:	I can't be bothered to leave my house.
B:	You have more of a choice, you're not pressed upon as bad.
M:	Hmmm... I'm not sure I'm too far in.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not even sure.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Ohh... uh... huh

M:	I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.
B:	And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable. They didn't have to do much to it.
M:	You.
B:	The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done. It's twenty years old, I think.
M:	Oh yeah? How about the other one?
B:	And, but they have two children, too, and they, they bought what they could afford.
M:	But they have, uh, their, uh kids, uh
B:	Uh-huh.

M:	Is this real?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, it's nice
B:	Oh, my you you do when you When we first got married, uh, my husband works for the state, and we moved once a year usually
M:	When did you first move to Texas?
B:	And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more
M:	And the state had to pay us to move to the state.
B:	Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah.
M:	...
B:	Yeah.
M:	so it's a place, yeah?
B:	Uh-huh. I do too,
M:	Well, we've been considering Pennsylvania, and we think we're going to be okay.
B:	I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
M:	You have a house in a nice neighborhood and you live in a city. I don't think it matters.
B:	You know, they buy a place and they just hate the area.
M:	Ohh, I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well I hate Dallas
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
M:	But... but I'm gonna be there in five years!

M:	Yeah, I'm going to the police
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	You know
B:	Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.

B:	I, I couldn't handle that
M:	You know, you could, uh, have a home...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, I can't even look.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And it's not even a real grass.
B:	I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, because we mow, you know, a good bit of ground around the house area.
M:	Oh, well, I just really like the place.
B:	And I do get tired of that but, uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want to change it.
M:	You do.
