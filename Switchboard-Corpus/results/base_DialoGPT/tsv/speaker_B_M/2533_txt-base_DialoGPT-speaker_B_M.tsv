B:	after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.
M:	Football, baseball, and football.
B:	Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far I couldn't do it.
M:	
B:	Right, he's supposed to be able to do that.
M:	you
B:	Oh, really? I didn't know that.
M:	He was in the hospital, so he's probably not too serious
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Yeah, and I've been watching, uh, my husband's French and so if I've been watching the French news, when I watch it.
M:	I've been watch, you know.
B:	It's incentive , speaking of Bush, we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush, they that had a story where he went to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff.
M:	Yes.
B:	Did you see that, where he, the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
M:	I saw that.
B:	he said his .
M:	Who said he was?
B:	I know and see a credit card
M:	You don't need to know if he's a real person, you just need to see it.
B:	It was so funny to see, it was a really cute little kid too.
M:	I love how he was like Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh.
B:	Well, I can tell you, that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,
M:	I think I'm going to go and see, what, one, two
B:	because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game, and I couldn't tell you who pitched,
M:	Why are you saying that?
B:	but they won, the Mets won.
M:	I'm a Mets fan. I've never been to a game.
B:	But, yeah, not my a lot, *sp? by and then somebody else lost, maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees,
M:	They won.
B:	but I don't even know if they're still New York Yankees, or New Jersey.
M:	I'm pretty sure New York Mets is New Jersey Mets.
B:	Yeah.
M:	What about New York?
B:	Well, but it, then they can have them play against each other.
M:	I'm not sure what the purpose of this is, but it's a good thing.
B:	I think it's still the New York Yankees, you know,
M:	I mean... it is the New Jersey Yankees...
B:	I thought they were moving to New Jersey This is how much I know about baseball.
M:	It's the New Jersey Yankees
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So... who's the team?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's a baseball team?
B:	Right .
M:	Well, I was thinking more of a'They're not a big company, they're just a small company '
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... I'm surprised.
B:	With baseball tickets.
M:	I don't think it was that expensive.
B:	Yeah .
M:	But they were.
B:	Wow.
M:	They are my parents'rooms.
B:	Because they're fancy seats and stuff.
M:	Why is it that they are so cheap?
B:	I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game. I rarely go but we went last year because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
M:	
B:	and if there's a game on, he's watching it. I mean, that's all there is to it,
M:	w.
B:	and he's like glued at the T V.
M:	Yeah but it's not the same.
B:	Oh, I'm glad my husband's not like that either, I'd kill him My brother's like that and, um, see he goes to a lot of games, not a real lot, but he tries to go, then my father got us some tickets,
M:	I've been on the train to him since I was a kid.
B:	so my brother's wife and my husband and I went. Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like.
M:	My brother.
B:	And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd, it was nice weather and stuff, it wasn't a real problem, but you sit there in a crowd, and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um, because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,
M:	what?
B:	and, um, so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored, and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time,
M:	I, i'm...
B:	yeah, and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of O strip east to west, eastern part,
M:	Yes,
B:	but that ,
M:	You
B:	Yeah, he's not that far, he was sort of in between Strasbourg, and Paris.
M:	He's from Strasburg, but he's
B:	Oh, is she still there?
M:	No, she lives in Strasbourg.
B:	Because,
M:	Oh, I'm not the only one.
B:	Yeah, Saint Claude,
M:	Are you Saint Claude?
B:	yeah, we used to, that's one of the, um, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
M:	I'm not sure about that.
B:	And it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,
M:	Well, that's the limit of the street, but it's not really the limit, I'm pretty sure.
B:	I exactly where she is. But, um, we met in Paris.
M:	Umm... what?
B:	Twelve children?
M:	I know...
B:	Oh, my God, the poor woman.
M:	It's only her two children, she's fine.
B:	Were any of them twins?
M:	Oh, she was beautiful.
B:	You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
M:	And now I'm sad
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ughh, I can't eat!
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You.
B:	But how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first baby, almost any day Uh-huh.
M:	I have the.
B:	Wow.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're the book?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	I, I don't know what Foley's is
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ya but it's a store and it's not like a mall
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't think I'll ever be able to afford that.
B:	Yeah, well, that makes a really big difference. But, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,
M:	But, but
B:	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
M:	Yeah, but it's a very different situation.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We have a softball league
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	I admire someone that can do that, you know, I really can.
M:	You know, I have a lot of friends.
