B:	Huh-uh.
M:	Yup. uuh
B:	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.
M:	I'm, like... a dump, like, dump, dump.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Are they still in the bins?
B:	Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and I ask in Wal-Mart and they said they moved it just behind.
M:	Why do you ask?
B:	Huh-uh.
M:	Hehe, I like it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't,
B:	Yeah.
M:	I guess you could say it
B:	Like aluminum cans?
M:	I can't think of a single thing we do.
B:	That's about what we do too.
M:	Yeah. It's pretty common.
B:	Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.
M:	I'm in Houston, so I can't even get the car.
B:	Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,
M:	I don't think you know what I mean.

B:	Yeah.
M:	LOLF, why?
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah, like, you?
B:	Those milk cartons take up so much room.
M:	I think the only thing I can say is that I'm really looking forward to this
B:	I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.
M:	Why would they?
B:	We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.
M:	How was the recycling process?
B:	Some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff
M:	nots
B:	so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.
