B:	And we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger Staubach . And we kind of got spoiled.
M:	We're from Ohio.
B:	We expected it to continue forever. I think they're doing pretty well this year though.
M:	The Bears have a really good offense.
B:	I think two.
M:	I'm confused. How many playoff games have they won?
B:	I know they lost, yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia.
M:	And they're 2 0 against the NFC West.
B:	Yeah, and wasn't that fun. I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, and I must say I attracted a lot of attention.
M:	It's been a while since I've seen the Giants, but I think they're doing alright.
B:	People running up saying, oh, what's the score, what's the score?
M:	The score is so depressing, I can't even watch
B:	That's right and that's exactly what they said, to sound like a my wife dragged me away from the television.
M:	They said it was a little cold, so I'm not sure if they were right.
B:	You know, but I wasn't, I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't have been there.
M:	I was at the game and it was pretty loud
B:	Yeah.
M:	He was a fan of football, right?
B:	That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think.
M:	What?
B:	It was, uh, you know, it's easier to join them than fight them.
M:	Well I mean, it's not like they're the ones that fight them.
B:	And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.
M:	If you want a fight, you should go watch the Texans.
B:	And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
M:	I know.
B:	Well, it takes a little brainwashing first.
M:	Why?
B:	Yeah.
M:	We'll be back
B:	Are you, uh, transit usually? I mean do you stay not in one place too long?
M:	I don't know.
B:	Well, it will take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver.
M:	I'm so sorry
B:	Oh, I know.
M:	No.
B:	Well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
M:	I know, I have no idea
B:	But, uh, Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.
M:	The world is a weird place.
B:	Yeah, that's right, you know he was one of ours, one of our boys.
M:	We're still a pretty cool place
B:	So we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.
M:	We are never cheering for the Broncos.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Do they ever cheer for the Broncos?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's funny, we never ever cheer against the Broncos.
B:	Johnny Elway.
M:	Elway.
B:	Well, there is so much about it to like.
M:	That.
B:	You know it's so exciting.
M:	I love the fact that he's wearing a hat.
B:	And when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs, and we all ran out and bought the records, and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.
M:	There's a lot of stuff about the game here, so you might have to wait a bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I
