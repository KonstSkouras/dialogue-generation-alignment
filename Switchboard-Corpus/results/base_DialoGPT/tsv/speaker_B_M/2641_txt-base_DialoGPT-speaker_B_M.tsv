B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh yeah? Um, uh, uh.
B:	Yeah, I like having cats around or pets around in general I, I favor dogs over cats actually but,
M:	I like dogs, they're cool.
B:	Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person. I had, I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right?
M:	I was always a dog people. I don't, uh, like dogs.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You have a cat?
B:	But not cats.
M:	And dogs
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But no
B:	The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
M:	It's dog
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	They.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think that's cute.
B:	Limited.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	That's the most important thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	i'm?
B:	Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,
M:	No,
B:	Yeah, I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,
M:	I think you mean cat.
B:	and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.
M:	That's pretty cool, I'd love to do that.
B:	Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,
M:	I'm not sure how many times I've done this, but I have a good amount of time in the house
B:	and so it wasn't so bad.
M:	The last time I did that, it was for the second time
B:	two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling, I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there, because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been,
M:	How many times have you tried this?
B:	all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
M:	How do you know?
B:	I that true, yeah. Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is, is basically a reject, somebody had bought him, and wanted him.
M:	oh yeah! I remember that!
B:	It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was and now, she's stuck with it.
M:	What happened?
B:	And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it. So, you know,
M:	I
B:	No, we don't have anything right now.
M:	So, you don'have anything to
B:	Oh, right, now we have a kid but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat, he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid, and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend, And,
M:	What, you know
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can.
B:	That's, uh, yeah, really true. But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats, they have four of them, and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,
M:	, they,?
B:	and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that. I, I tried to have, um, figured something having, so I tried to have a goldfish,
M:	You.
B:	and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
M:	' about.
B:	Right.
M:	i, i, i.
B:	My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that, and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser. I'll never forget that because I remember my brother, he came home and he counted the fish
M:	i'm
B:	and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.
M:	Fish
B:	it was not gross, I didn't see it but, um, got them.
M:	How did he get out of that fish?
B:	Trying to remember we had a dog for a while, and I don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it, my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,
M:	Why would you do that?
B:	but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish.
M:	That is so weird.
B:	And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
M:	I think they are the most fun, they're just not as fun as a dog.
B:	Well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,
M:	It's a fish, not a
B:	and then he had a, um, I forget what type of fish it was, it was one of these fish that it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like that. There would be sort of moby fish in a tank.
M:	I'm
B:	Yeah, and it, I, I couldn't see having fish like that.
M:	You mean, he, I was sick, and I, I didn't have any fish.
B:	I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty but,
M:	I mean, they do have a lot of food in them.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yup, we have a few fish that are, uh, pretty rare.
B:	Yeah.
M:	What?! I'm not getting it.
B:	Yeah, no, that would be, what did they do, everyone come around and watch them.
M:	I like it.
B:	I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house, and your things destroyed the mice.
M:	Not really. I mean, I have a laptop and mouse, but I can't use the mouse anymore.
B:	But,
M:	It's not really a problem, I don't have any problems.
B:	Let's see , I had a pet rat, for a while, and it was a live rat, and, um, this woman just offered it to me while I was in, in graduate school and, she was actually a very fun pet.
M:	Oh, that's a good idea.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, he's a very nice guy.
B:	Yeah , mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick, and she said, I don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant,
M:	You
B:	And they had misclassed the sex of back there and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies, and I took the baby and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like, half the price of a mouse,
M:	yes
B:	and then she grew to be, you know, I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
M:	I
B:	I don't know how much, and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate. She would, you know, crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working, and things like that. Yeah, much more than you would think.
M:	She
B:	Yeah and,
M:	and...
B:	Yeah, I, sort of weird for me to have had one too but there, it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and, you know, it was easy. Easy to take care of
M:	my
B:	and but,
M:	He's a cat.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know, I'm just saying it's not true
B:	Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning but, um, yeah, we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.
M:	That was fun, you know.
B:	And so it's almost impossible to, it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,
M:	I've never met a dog that could do that.
B:	I mean, people do,
M:	They don't, they live in Manhattan
B:	but it's not,
M:	I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it is.
B:	Oh, yeah, you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them, it's really kind of funny.
M:	Yeah, I mean, it's a real, uh, place.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ohhhh, yeah, uh, no.
B:	Right, no, they don't. I should make you ,
M:	... and we have a deal.
B:	they have, um, the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to, keep them, yeah, keep them clean
M:	Are they not allowed to keep their bags in the back?
B:	but, oh, gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime, just the smell is so bad of the horses.
M:	You're a bit late, they're just getting there.
B:	Oh, well, it's not that long ago. It was , Oh, twelve times, of the year.
M:	Well, I guess it was the first time in the world.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think I know
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's been a long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know what I mean, eh?
B:	Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything or are they just,
M:	Yea. I live in the city.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... are they mutts?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know, right?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	uhh, uh, um, they're
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not sure how you know that, but I
B:	They're both females?
M:	They are both male.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Uh-huh.
