B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think you have a weird fixation on them.
B:	Oh.
M:	he's a redditor.
B:	Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science
M:	Why are you so awesome?
B:	but beyond that, uh, lately I've been reading, I've always liked the NEW YORKER.
M:	Yeah, you do.
B:	my  wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. BON APPETITE, and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET.
M:	I've always been interested in food magazines.
B:	Yeah. And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much
M:	yeah she likes to eat.
B:	but she seems to.
M:	I like her.
B:	Do you read a newspaper?
M:	I read a lot of newspapers, but I'm not one of them.
B:	Yeah.  larger computer ones.
M:	Like a computer?
B:	I haven't bought it now for about eight years. But when I used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three hundred of them advertising.
M:	I have it on a computer, and it's pretty great.
B:	That, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
M:	I think you mean the half of the fun.
B:	But, you know, some of the get ridiculous. TRAVEL AND LEISURE, all of the AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines
M:	Yeah, but they're also the ones who read the articles.
B:	so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.
M:	...
B:	Uh-huh. Have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time?
M:	not.
B:	But not worth it.
M:	'.
B:	I, I've always had this, one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective.
M:	I, I, I'm not sure.
B:	So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.
M:	I've always found the gun magazines to be a lot more comfortable to hold than the magazines themselves.
B:	And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on
M:	Umm... and I always think it's funny when people say they disagree with me.
B:	So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective. Uh, you know, their major interest is in commissions and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines. Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is and it gives you a different perspective on what people do.
M:	
B:	Uh, some of them. The, the general travel magazines do.
M:	i
B:	But I, I usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff.
M:	Huh, you
B:	No.
M:	Uhh, what's your favorite magazine?
B:	Yeah. I don't take much more in myself.
M:	You take any magazines?
B:	Okay.
M:	I don't need it.
B:	Okay,  nice talking to you.
