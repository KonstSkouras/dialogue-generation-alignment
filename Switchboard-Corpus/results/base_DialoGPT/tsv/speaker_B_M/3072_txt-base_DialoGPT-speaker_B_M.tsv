M:	You in Detroit?
B:	Well, it wasn't really. It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
M:	What happened to it?
B:	And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.
M:	Yeah.I think I know where you live.
B:	No. The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.
M:	I don't know, why would you recommend it?
B:	And that was real nice. Uh,
M:	Yeah, it was.
B:	No, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
M:	I'm from Canada, so I can't say that I've seen that.
B:	Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
M:	Have you ever been there?
B:	Huh.
M:	I'm a bit tired, but I'm going to do a little vacation in the beach.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
M:	How do you?
B:	Oh, well, that's nice. Yeah.
M:	What's that?
B:	Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, and that's canoeing.
M:	
B:	And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.
M:	They're... They're just...
B:	It's a whole new, Uh-huh.
M:	So... it's like... it is?
B:	Huh.
M:	They've been, uh, uh.
B:	Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	You know.
B:	Oh, that's neat. Sure.
M:	I'm
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yea.But what if it was too easy?
B:	Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too, and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,
M:	Yeah, I was.
B:	and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do
M:	I don't know, I don't really have any friends
B:	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
M:	I have a strong interest in learning, and I'm not sure what that means.
B:	And you're more receptive.
M:	I do what i want
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	well, we do, we've been in texas before
B:	Oh, that's exciting.
M:	I don't know. I've been to Spain and France.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh. I was there.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I,, uh
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	You've been
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Well, that's a little odd.
B:	Do your own thing. Yeah.
M:	Yeah, but then I'd have to walk around for hours.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah uh
B:	That's wonderful. There's a lot out there to see,
M:	Yeah. I was really surprised when I saw a lot more people.
B:	I'll say .
M:	I see
B:	Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada
M:	I don't think I've ever been to the United states.
B:	So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice.
M:	I'm from Canada, I was just thinking about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You live in Canada?
B:	Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around.
M:	So, do you know where you're going?
B:	Well, you've been quite a few places there
M:	Oh, right.
B:	Once you think about it, huh. Uh-huh.
M:	It's weird.
B:	Oh, that's great.
M:	I was.
B:	Uh-huh. That's great.
M:	And there was no language problem.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	I was there.
B:	What did you wind up with?
M:	I don't know, but it's the only place I know I've been to that has a decent menu.
B:	Oh, okay
M:	I know.
B:	Uh, uh-huh.
M:	Oh. You did?
B:	They kind of guided you.
M:	How did I get in?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Huh. What about them?
B:	Well, good.
M:	well, it was.
B:	I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.
M:	That's why I always, uh, plan for the future.
B:	Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about.
M:	Yeah. I guess.
B:	Yes.
M:	Do you have a job?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	I understand that. Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.
M:	It was nice talk.
B:	You do the same.
M:	He shrugs. I'm fine.
B:	Thank you.
M:	I am.
B:	Bye-bye.
