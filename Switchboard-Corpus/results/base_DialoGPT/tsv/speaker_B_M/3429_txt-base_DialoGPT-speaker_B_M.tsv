B:	So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
M:	No, I'm fine.
B:	Well, yeah, that.
M:	I can remember my youth
B:	I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
M:	Not in the last century.
B:	Uh-huh, relaxed and laid back and stuff
M:	I guess.
B:	and.
M:	And
B:	I think so.
M:	Well, it's not like they're doing anything.
B:	I think so, and a lot, I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
M:	Oh, okay. So, what's it like?
B:	Right.
M:	Yeah.Right.
B:	Yeah, I think so. I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
M:	I
B:	and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
M:	I think you mean like pro prochoice.
B:	I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
M:	And then you have the stigma of prochoice
B:	No, huh-uh.
M:	Huh. huh.
B:	Right. Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
M:	I was
B:	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
M:	No,
B:	but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
M:	I'm not, I'm just being a naive person
B:	It wasn't that long that I was that young.
M:	Oh, well... I mean...
B:	And I've got a ten year old, and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms, and and he knows about AIDS,
M:	You can't have kids if you don't have a sense of humor.
B:	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
M:	You have to tell me about what you have.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I said.
B:	No, I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part. I mean that's, sex is rampant,
M:	No, you're just
B:	and it always will be, and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
M:	I'm so sorry.
B:	I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
M:	I know,
B:	but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
M:	That's all of the good stuff
B:	and, and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer.
M:	You know, you just say, uh, it's cool, I'm not like that, you know?
B:	You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.
M:	How do I get the answers to my questions?
B:	They, they, that just does not go.
M:	And if you do not get the answer, you are, I am, I, I.
B:	And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know
M:	That's why they have the Cabbage patch, and you can see the cabbages.
B:	But it, it's interesting, listening to them. I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation.
M:	What? I'm just kidding.
B:	Yeah, I do too.
M:	...
B:	I know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
