B:	Yeah. I have two plots, one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four.
M:	I like to have a plan
B:	It's a long skinny one and,
M:	I, uh, uh... I'm not sure how to word that.
B:	Oh, I see. Yeah. I see.
M:	A lot of people do.
B:	Right. Right. Yeah, it's nice to get out in the open air.
M:	I know right. I like to fiddle around in my garage.
B:	And especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever,
M:	It's good
B:	but, uh,  sometimes I,  I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space you know.
M:	Well, it's the only way.
B:	I grow a lot of things, a lot of food.
M:	But, uh, you don't have to say that.
B:	And sometimes I, I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something,  like that.  Plant one of those
M:	I, I, I like plants.
B:	and it takes up your whole space
M:	I see. Well, uh...
B:	Yeah. Yeah. They, they just run all over, the place, don't they,
M:	I'm so
B:	Right. Right.
M:	Yes. It's a good garden area.
B:	The basics. Right. Yeah. That's what we do too.
M:	I've been doing it.
B:	Right. Peas
M:	Yeah. You can't really do that without the roots.
B:	I, I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
M:	We do.
B:	The first one, they started them indoors this time. I read it,
M:	Wait. Did you just make them?
B:	And so I,
M:	You know what I like?
B:	Yeah. I, uh, I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that,
M:	I'll be the one who grows.
B:	But, uh, sure is a heck of a lot of work.
M:	I can't even start a farm, so it's just a farm
B:	Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered
M:	Why would you want to do that?
B:	and I, I don't think I'll do it again
M:	Oh. I'm sorry
B:	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I enjoy it. I come home from work and, and I usually say hello to wife and kids, and then go out and fiddle, you know, just walk around the yard and inspect it
M:	Oh. Yeah, I've never been to a museum before.
B:	and the kids want to swing,
M:	It's the same in the UK.
B:	and I push them on swing.
M:	I'll play with your hand
B:	And I I mow my own lawn.
M:	I I'm a grown up.
B:	And I do, I don't have a sprinkler system. I, I don't enjoy watering.
M:	I don't, I'm not a robot.
B:	Especially,
M:	We do.
B:	Oh how,
M:	We have a water pump, but it's not enough to power our water.
B:	Oh.
M:	It's the best.
B:	Yeah, you can have it come on just early in the morning. And, and off by the, you know, by the time you're up and about.
M:	i'm just kidding
B:	Yeah. I, I usually get it started for my wife
M:	That sounds great!
B:	and I, and she moves it around ever other day.
M:	Ah, the, of.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You don't have to, it's a good habit.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	What do you do for a living?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... what?
B:	Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, uh, chemical services to come, out and spray for weeds, and fertilize, and all that and take that one step out of .
M:	I don't think I could ever get a lawn to go.
B:	But, uh, they want too much money.
M:	I don't know, I don't have an excuse.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, it's not expensive.
B:	Right. Right. But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.
M:	Because of the chemicals.
B:	Right and the weed come up,
M:	What do you mean?
B:	and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
M:	And now I'm in a good mood
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, right.
B:	Well, if you,  enjoy it too, you know, you, you can get out in the morning when, before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to,
M:	I, too, enjoy it
B:	Right.
M:	You're not limited, you have to do it
B:	When the days start getting a little longer, you know, you can, I can start doing it in the evening after work.
M:	What's the time for?
B:	When they, when they switch to, switch,
M:	When you, when they, switch
B:	when we get an hour more,
M:	I can start working on it in an hour.
B:	when they rollback an hour.
M:	When they roll back an hour.
B:	I don't know.
M:	When will the patch be available?
B:	I really don't know. It just seems like I here it on the news the day before.
M:	They're still in the news.
B:	And, uh, I, I think it's coming up here soon.
M:	Yea, I know.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Oh. Well I think I heard something about it being on the website.
B:	Are you having any trouble with bugs in, in your garden?
M:	I have no idea.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Right. Right. I, I, it seems like they come in spurts.
M:	Ugh, it's not good.
B:	One year I didn't put anything on and I didn't have any problems.
M:	Uhhh, you're not even on my list.
B:	Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever.
M:	How do you plant cabbage?
B:	They were just covered with them,
M:	How did they get that?
B:	I mean, I went up, I didn't go out there for about three days, you know, because I, and I went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem,
M:	The plants.
B:	they devoured it that quickly.
M:	The plant was just covered in leaves, it didn't even have a stem
B:	And, they, they, have a, you, a good appetite
M:	They have a great sense of humor.
B:	And they would, you know, I, I picked off like twenty of them and,
M:	They have, you know, the,,...
B:	yeah.
M:	It's also, they're just as much a threat to your crops as tomatoes.
B:	They got that, uh, what is that safer soap, uh, B T spray this, year.
M:	The first rule of being a tomato is never to use soap.
B:	And I've been watching them every day and I've, and I haven't seen any signs yet. So, if I see any signs I'm going to spray them,
M:	I've been doing that since the first week of July.
B:	and, uh,
M:	I've been seeing signs for years, and I'm not even in the UK.
B:	Right.
M:	Hehehe. No,
B:	Well, the good stuff. Right.
M:	It's the best thing ever.
B:	Right. Yeah, my backyard is, uh, is sloping so I built a box up, you know had to build the one, the low side up.
M:	So what about the wall?
B:	And, uh, I had sandy loam hauled in. I had a dump truck come and dump it.
M:	Well, that's just
B:	On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do and then, I had to wheel barrow it in.
M:	I guess they do that.
B:	But, uh, you know, you can improve your own soil there
M:	Right. So, uh, they'll fix it.
B:	but the Texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.
M:	That's the worst I've ever seen.
B:	Right. And you know, if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean
M:	I know, but you have no idea how much it cost to get it to grow
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have, do you have a rotor tiller?
M:	I don't.
B:	Small enough, you have a, just do it by hand?
M:	Why???! Why?
B:	Yeah.
M:	... so?
B:	Yeah.  Yeah.
M:	Oh? I think that was the last job I ever had.
B:	Yeah. I'd like to get one of these little small ones, that you see in all these gardening magazines.
M:	I don't have one.
B:	And it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.
M:	That's a big yellow'a '.
B:	My neighbor across the street has one. He always uses it to dethatch his lawn,
M:	You don't have a yard?
B:	I see him out there,
M:	The dog is in the background.
B:	and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
M:	It's a sniper rifle.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I see.
B:	I have a friend who has one and, and he lets me, you know, no problem borrowing if it's, just a hassle when you know, to go up
M:	How do you keep your phone unlocked?
B:	and it's a fairly large one to, heave it up into the back of the van, bring it home and, check it back and just grab it, you know, if I, just go to my garage and grab it.
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	That would be nice.
M:	I'll have to look up how to do it
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You've had the green grass for years.
B:	What have you got growing right now?
M:	Well, we've had one of the most successful seasons in a long time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, we don't have a tree...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, what?
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	Uuhh, I have a few radishes.
B:	Okay,
M:	Uhhh, yes, you are.
B:	what kind,
M:	Okay, okay.
B:	what kind of onions do you grow? Do you grow those, those ten, fifteen Y?
M:	Yup, I have a few, and they are awesome.
B:	Oh, they, they are the best.
M:	They're good!
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	What are you talking about? I was just talking about the garden.
B:	Uh, those,
M:	We've got them all over the place.
B:	I see.
M:	Oh. Uh, uh, I guess I'll see you then.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, those onions, I think, we, we planted like twice as much this year because, you know, we got, onions and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like October,
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	and, uh, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare.
M:	Uhhh, we,
B:	She made these onion rings that were so good,
M:	That's, so.
B:	and, and, and, uh, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in,  that it's an ingredient,
M:	I'm so proud of you
B:	and, and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
M:	They were good
B:	Right. Right. We froze a lot of peppers. We let some turn red.
M:	so.much.corn.corn.
B:	And some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas. And, and chops them up in recipes and things like that.
M:	We do a lot more than that.
B:	Oh, yeah. Put them in salad, yeah.
M:	We do green. And uh, yeah.
B:	You're, you're making me hungry here.
M:	Heh. Yeah.
B:	Oh.
M:	They're plant matter.
B:	Yellow peppers, huh.
M:	no, i haven't
B:	Yeah. Sounds like you have a real good garden.
M:	I have a garden.
B:	Just let me see what I got, I got the peas and I've got some broccoli, uh, onions some, some radishes and, uh, uh, beets.
M:	That's it.
B:	Uh, and I planted potatoes too.
M:	Well, we're also gonna be a bit different.
B:	Oh, the potato, They were, they're delicious but they, you don't get, seem to get that much for the space,
M:	Uh, they?
B:	they, they do.
M:	I've never seen a potato that big.
B:	Some beet, uh, potatoes
M:	... I don't think you understand the question.
B:	and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,
M:	They have a lot of potatoes
B:	I got to wait for a place to, to, to free up.
M:	Hehehe, I'm gonna wait for the next to be!
B:	Uh, our, our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year.
M:	Uhh, we're gonna be okay, right?
B:	We've got some good, um, um, Hybrid Burpee uh uh, pickler cucumbers
M:	We have some pretty good cucumbers.
B:	and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
M:	Uh, you're gonna need to pickle your own pickle.
B:	I know it. I said, why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers, you know?
M:	They're not that expensive.
B:	I guess. But we're going to try that, and see how that works.
M:	It's not, it's just a cucumber.
B:	An experiment.
M:	What are you trying to do?
B:	I'd like to try, you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	and,
M:	I'll try it.
B:	Well.
M:	I know
