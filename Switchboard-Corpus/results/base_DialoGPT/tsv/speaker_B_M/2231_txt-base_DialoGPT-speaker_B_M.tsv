B:	And that, that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
M:	That, that, that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, do you think that's a good idea?
B:	That's, I agree with that completely. I know we don't have enough prisons, but there has got to be some kind of punishment, For these people.
M:	No. They can be put in jail, but if they're convicted, they are not sentenced.
B:	Because if they turn around, they can get away, they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and then they do something worse
M:	Why do they do this?
B:	and they get a slap on the wrist. They get, thirty days in jail
M:	They get a lifetime ban.
B:	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else, and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
M:	They get a sentence. They get a fine.
B:	And it's, Well, they certainly are living off our at our expense.
M:	they're, They're
B:	I didn't ,
M:	You should've.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm sorry
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They are in jail.
B:	And, and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,
M:	And, and be put in prison, and, and.
B:	that's what, that's what people face with that choice. One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know, they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know,
M:	I'm not crying
B:	that should be life, but, instead, in, in given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know, and less they're out.
M:	and, to, you, to be.
B:	Even if, if they're even in that long. Or they appeal, and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something.
M:	They
B:	Yeah. I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent, I think people know that nobody, that it doesn't, you know, it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective.
M:	You
B:	There's should be, you know, this, for this crime, this is the penalty. You killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever.
M:	No, of, of you,
B:	This is what's going to happen.
M:	I'm not sure.
B:	And, I mean, it sounds horrible. It, I hear myself saying this, and, but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,
M:	I,,, I think,, you,, got it.
B:	because they let them back out again, and they do the same thing over,  and over,  again,
M:	Why is there no reason to do that?
B:	then they put them back in jail, and they get out, and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
M:	If they were, then they are.
B:	and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system.
M:	They were. They're still on the death row list.
B:	And it's like I said at our expense.
M:	yeah, they are in jail.
B:	Yes.
M:	Do you think that the US is the only country that does that?
B:	I know, I, you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible
M:	Oh, no, it's a big story. It's not news.
B:	and they just get away with it, and nothing happens.
M:	They get away, but they get away.
B:	Yeah. I think I think Texas is Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty, and I think, I know California had it for a long time, and then they, uh, took it off the books, they repealed it
M:	So...
B:	and people like Charles Manson, and, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now, now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes. The people who were there originally, when they, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are still in there for, are in prison, in quote, for life, and, and are now coming up for parole, some of them, like Manson who's come up you know
M:	the
B:	it's been denied fortunately but,
M:	i
B:	Yeah.
M:	Did you know??
B:	Well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death
M:	You know what, it's just a joke.
B:	and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies, and then they reinstated it later, but the penalty didn't go back. You know?
M:	I know. I'm just saying that he was sentenced to death.
B:	It seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
M:	I'm sorry, but I don't understand the appeal process.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think there is a criminal law in California, I think
B:	Yeah. And the, the laws are all, the rules. Some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women
M:	This
B:	and then he gets up for this one trial, and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
M:	Hmmmm
B:	and so they say, well, this is, you know, I, I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever, but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
M:	Ayeaay
B:	Yeah, yeah. Well, To some extent if they would do something with some of those people. But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
M:	This.
B:	They plead insanity
M:	They said they'd do it.
B:	and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
M:	What if they die?
B:	I mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out,
M:	They do it all the time. I don't think they're afraid of the consequences.
B:	I know, in, in the Dallas metroplex area, I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself
M:	It's a good thing you don't live in Dallas, I would have been terrified to go to the airport alone.
B:	and I, I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas, and it wasn't that way when I was younger.
M:	No, it's the opposite.
B:	We could go around, and, boy and,
M:	I've been to the very top of the world and I'm in the very bottom of the earth.
B:	Yes. Ever, you can't even, when I was a kid, I would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes, and, as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time,
M:	That's
B:	and now I don't let my kids out of the front yard, that I can't see them.
M:	I was sooooo
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not sure, but I can tell you, I'm not, you
B:	Well, good talking to you too. Bye,
M:	I know.
B:	bye.
M:	I don't know.
