B:	I kind of, I think so, too. I think that's a bit dramatic, but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing, helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.
M:	I, etc.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm not saying it's okay.I just think it is a little too
B:	Your right, I do, too, I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts a video doing
M:	I do,
B:	Right, that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you involved real good and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
M:	i.
B:	Something,
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	They are?
B:	I do, too. I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that. And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out. I think that's good and,
M:	Well.
B:	Yeah,  yeah.
M:	We
B:	Yeah There you go.
M:	you,
B:	Right.
M:	I'm just kidding.
B:	Yeah, it sounds pretty good That sounds good. I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff, and I think that's pretty neat. They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over
M:	I like that, uh, thing
B:	and they clean it up.
M:	It's called a garage
B:	And keep it clean. I think that's I pretty good idea. And I think, you know, again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older. I know I did, you know, in Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
M:	
B:	So, Oh.
M:	Hahaah. I'm... it's ice, and ice.
B:	Yeah, I'm in Texas. Where are you at?
M:	Oh??
B:	New York.
M:	Where are you from?
B:	Oh, gosh.
M:	Yeah, I'm from the US
B:	Yeah.
M:	Is this upstate New york?
B:	Yeah
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.  Oh, no.
M:	Yeah. And there's a bunch of trees in Rochester.
B:	Oh.
M:	I'm back.
B:	Golly.
M:	Ah, so it was.
B:	Are you serious?
M:	It's been on the internet for over a week now.
B:	Oh my God,  how do they live?
M:	I have a feeling that they'll be back soon.
B:	Yeah. I haven't heard a thing.
M:	Is there any news about this?
B:	Lord.
M:	It's been a few days since the last earthquake
B:	Well, that's good.  That's great.
M:	We're on the ground floor of a major hospital in the UK
B:	Right.   Yeah.
M:	I think it's good
B:	Right.
M:	Right.
B:	and we go along and, I'm really not sure how we find the individuals, but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it, and, uh, we go along with all the material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix whatever we can.
M:	I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say.
B:	Yeah, and spend a day doing, that's really neat. I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time, but you know, every little bit helps.
M:	Is
B:	Uh, yeah. They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company.
M:	They do it
B:	So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material. Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
M:	How does he, what do you do?
B:	Yeah. And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know so much as, we just want to help people out.
M:	I don't get it.
B:	So it's real neat.
M:	I am not sure what is happening.
B:	It's,   Yeah,
M:	So what is this?
B:	it's  like I say, it's not a lot, but it helps people. Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
M:	How do you do that?
B:	and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps, so
M:	I, uh, don't know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	so what you want to do, is it like a hug?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be mean.
B:	Gosh. That's great. That's a lot.
M:	A lot.
B:	That's, that's a lot of kids, though.
M:	A good chunk of my school participated.
B:	Oh, well, still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids.
M:	That, is, that's not a good thing.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, well, I mean, it's a small town.
B:	Yeah.  That's neat.
M:	It's really, really neat.I know of people who would buy it.
B:	That's great.
M:	I got involved with it.It was a dance dance, a group of people were dancing.
B:	That's great. But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think they should have to do a year
M:	It's a pretty good way to get into a lot of trouble.
B:	Yeah. I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean. They're not worth it
M:	I'm not sure. Maybe it's just a year or two in the academy.
B:	Right. Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
M:	You can't you?
B:	Oh.
M:	Nah.
B:	I couldn't either.
M:	You know, I'm not sure.
B:	I couldn't either.
M:	Oh.oh
B:	Right,  right.
M:	He's the best and he's the worst.
B:	Yeah. I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and, I mean, she's a teacher and, and just wanted to do it. She'd been a teacher for a while. Just decided she wanted to do it, so. I mean, I'm grateful for people like that, but, I don't see how they can just, Yeah,
M:	What?
B:	just, pick up and head on out.
M:	I mean, I'm not sure what I could do.
B:	I wish I could do something like that, but I can't, so
M:	Yeah, but it's not a problem
B:	Right, that's the way I am.  I know the feeling.
M:	I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do that.
B:	That's right We're against it That's right.
M:	Well, I mean, I've never voted for a government that didn't.
B:	You, too, and I hope everything works out up there.
M:	I hope so too.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I'm still here, right?
B:	Good, good, that's great. Yeah. Well, good luck.
M:	I think so.
B:	Thanks.
M:	No problem. Good luck with everything.
B:	Bye video
