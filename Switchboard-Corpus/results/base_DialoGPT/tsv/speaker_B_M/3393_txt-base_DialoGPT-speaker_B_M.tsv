B:	We did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, Boone Greene, no out at, uh Andrews,
M:	We got a bunch of airshows.
B:	yeah. So what's it been like up there?
M:	It's been great.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yup, that's why we're here.
B:	Yeah. Uh, like September was hot and dry, October.
M:	October? What about October?
B:	Really? Huh. It really has been strange here this year, I mean, this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one.
M:	Well, it's autumn.
B:	But, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh, somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather, but. Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,
M:	Uuuh, yoo, it.
B:	and we had all this rain, and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool. But all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in October, uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time. And, uh, then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, you know. There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal, and then uh, into of November, the first, like the second week, uh, you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze,
M:	i.
B:	and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here
M:	
B:	but usually it's not until later It's really strange.
M:	Oh, we're, we, and it's, you, we've, it, it's
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think we're getting a frost this year.It's a little weird.
B:	Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?
M:	I'm so glad I live in Arizona.
B:	It's just kind of, uh, we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange. We haven't really had an autumn. It's like we went into winter
M:	So.
B:	you know, the poor trees, said what
M:	This is it.
B:	Yeah, uh, it's, Yeah, there, you, you know, usually there's, uh, I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas, and you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, you know, it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,
M:	
B:	and, uh, I was up there last weekend, and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on, and they're green, but they're dead You know, the, the freeze just got them. They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently, and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all. Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all. Really weird this year. I'm not sure what that, what that means.
M:	I.
B:	So you, you all actually had some color, huh?
M:	
B:	It kind of crept in and,
M:	We've been a lot of course, yea of, like, yeah, a lot.
B:	Yeah, it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
M:	We, we did.
B:	Gorgeous. That's, you know, I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not, and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same. It's almost, you know, identical kind of country.
M:	I think you're right.
B:	Beautiful.
M:	What's the difference between a car and a car?
B:	Yeah. Oh. Yeah, I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend, so.
M:	The trees are the same.
B:	Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it .
M:	How'd you cut it?
B:	Well.
M:	It's not that bad.
B:	Uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy. There's, nothing bothers them. Their leaves are still green, and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves. Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit, but they still look pretty good.
M:	
B:	It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree.
