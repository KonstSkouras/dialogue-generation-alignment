A:	and she is charging out of her mind already. And I'm going, you just got off. That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,
M:	She's so she's just fine.
A:	Oh.
M:	Are you in the US?
A:	So,
M:	The award is the amount of money
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	.
A:	But we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
M:	It's u I Am The Law, I know.
A:	Yeah.
M:	See you around.
A:	Yeah, well, I I, I don't know, I definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because, uh, you know, there's the classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where you get, you know,
M:	She's not.
A:	That, yes. I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
M:	What's going on here?
A:	they're always, always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
M:	That's what they said, but it's because they don't have a problem
A:	Yeah, uh, I'm in, uh, New York.
M:	
A:	Um.
M:	It's a good motivation. I'll be doing it again soon.
A:	And I was by myself in China too.
M:	I, I, you, you' read.
A:	Right.
M:	And I'm not sure if you are aware of the fact that they didn't allow it.
A:	Uh-huh. Right. I agree with that, I agree with that. But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn
M:	I think you're misunderstanding the question.
A:	Uh-huh. Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? Will they make it through the summer sun?
M:	I think it's a good thing.
A:	And, um, so, and we're on the colder side, they're on the rainy side, we're on the snowy side and, um, we, we ski. My, my children all ski
M:	I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I didn't feel anything
A:	Yeah. But it's funny that, uh, I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania. I'm not even sure of that, but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that. And, it surprised, and even Florida, I know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
M:	Yep.
A:	Not this past fall but I mean fall, a few years, I mean, it it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty-five,
M:	It's not, it's just, it is.
A:	Right.
M:	Is that the place in the middle of the picture?
A:	So you're, you're not that far north then, okay.
M:	I can't help but read this in the voice of the dude who's been trying to convince everyone he's a vampire.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	How about you?
A:	Well, that,
M:	I guess that's one way to do it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Wait, what?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So are you saying that they are going to be rehabilitated?
A:	That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place and it affects,
M:	They are all friends with the same person.
A:	but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,  I think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah,
M:	I'm a girl.
A:	And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.
M:	Some of them are just going to be on the internet forever.
A:	we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.
M:	Oh, uh, I've got a paper bag.
A:	Yeah
M:	It's a nice place to live.
A:	Yeah.  I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people. Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money  but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
M:	Uhhh, I would be hung up on the Lincoln.
A:	Um.
M:	We got the first pick in the NFC East, and then we got a QB that wasn't even the first overall pick.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	I found that out. I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,
M:	
A:	I don't know,
M:	Well, the car was designed for air pollution so, no, it's probably not a good design.
A:	at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
M:	You, uh, might want to check your math.
A:	they just say do you believe in such and such. Uh,
M:	Uuhuh. Uhuh.
A:	Yeah. We have some of them around here. You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
M:	How did you learn, uh.learn?
A:	Thirty day notice for what?
M:	I'm sorry
A:	Oh.
M:	I hate rain.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I, uh, know.
A:	I guess that, I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
M:	Yes.
A:	I know, I love mine too. Well, it's been nice talking to you.
M:	I love running, I love exercise, I'm a runner, I just like running.
A:	now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
M:	No, not family
A:	And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it, it ends up burning, I mean, no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
M:	But we're not in the UK
A:	Uh-huh. It sure is. The, you know, as far as, I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this, and it was something more than just the conferences. They were using it as eating out, uh, when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
M:	Is it just bad?
A:	I know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. You know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything.
M:	That sounds good.
A:	Oh, gosh, Chris Xeros You grew up with his children, too, then?
M:	I don't know, it's been a while since we've had a big problem with it.
A:	Uh, Oh, of course, of course they are. They want you to buy their car. Yeah, there, it was, it was interesting. I was at, I, I also went to, uh, the Porsche and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
M:	I
A:	the I think the, I guess the only real, um, benefit I guess you could say working, for me working here, besides I mean I'm learning and stuff because,  I'm at, you know, in school.
M:	You
A:	Yes.
M:	then,, that, and?
A:	and, uh, I've got carrots, I yes, I've got a few carrots up and I've got some radishes up,
M:	I dunno.
A:	And I thought, you know, that really, now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.
M:	I don't think you can use the gun with a gun in it.
A:	Um, I have no idea.
M:	And that's why I don'think it's going to fix anything
A:	But .  That is a very good point. I am from West Virginia so I understand what you are saying there
M:	Oh. Well, I guess you're right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's like a real life version of a movie.
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
M:	com,
M:	Uhhh, what?
