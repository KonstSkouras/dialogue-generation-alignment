A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, if you're happy with your wife, you can have her. If not, then you're not a real woman.
A:	The next generation, uh-huh.
M:	Because of?
A:	Oh, I have. I've, I've, I watched that late, um, I guess it's on late Saturday nights or something,
M:	I'm just wondering.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, I understand. We just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. Uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
M:	I am so confused.
A:	uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal. Singapore is very, supposed to be very safe and, in fact, Tokyo, and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
M:	You
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, uh-huh.
M:	I guess she's not too fond of it then.
A:	See, I've only been to Texas once. I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas, and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
M:	It.
A:	Yeah, I do too. Well, It's been good talking with you.
M:	No we don't.
A:	and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, you lucky thing.
M:	N
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
M:	Wait, what?
A:	You listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.
M:	Do you have a tablet?
A:	But I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, I mean besides murder, I think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,  caught more than twice or something, uh,  it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
M:	I think so.uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, uh, I don't want to, uh...
A:	and Rascal is a black and white short hair.
M:	So, what happened?
A:	my kid will do four or five hours this week for me.  No problem.
M:	I just,
A:	also saves a lot of time with commercials.
M:	Well, I got a few plants from my garden, so I can get them all over the place.
A:	Oh, that's great.
M:	How are you?
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
M:	Oh. That's cool.
A:	Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki. Which is an auditory type learning experience.
M:	That's true, but I think it's because he's in jail, and he's being held at gunpoint
A:	Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
M:	I'm not quite sure,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I'm sure it would, but I think
A:	but, uh, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably feel any differently,
M:	Well, we have the dog right now.
A:	And so, but that somehow takes, organization. For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading,
M:	
A:	Right.
M:	Well, I've been eating for the past few days.
A:	I would not imagine that.
M:	I know what you're talking about, but what about the other thing?
A:	Yeah, that's good.
M:	I don't know, it just goes all around.
A:	Flooding anywhere. I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, but, uh, no, I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
M:	You.
A:	Sure, yeah,
M:	
A:	And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves. Um,
M:	I think it's Polk Institute of Technology
A:	Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
M:	You think that's wrong?
A:	Those are nice, aren't they?   Yes, those are nice.
M:	They're just making a joke.
A:	Yeah, you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
M:	Is she ok?
A:	so.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	Okay.
M:	This is a shame.
A:	in fact, I think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
M:	Well, I can
A:	Yes. That, that was true for mine too. Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.  You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.
M:	:You
A:	Yes.
M:	
A:	All that stuff that's bad for you.
M:	Well, that's, uh, not good.
A:	Uh, they sure are just because, some innocent person, can really,
M:	I know. It's just, I don't really know what the other guy was thinking.
A:	and we have to pay that price, but, uh, I don't know, I don't know. It's interesting, and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,
M:	Uh... and then, uh, we have a baby and we're married in Minneapolis.
A:	I mean but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is it, uh, Asian or is it European or who,
M:	I'll be sure to.
