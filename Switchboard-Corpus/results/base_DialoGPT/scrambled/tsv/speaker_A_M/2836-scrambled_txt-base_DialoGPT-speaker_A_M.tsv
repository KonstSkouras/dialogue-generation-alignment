A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I don't think you can
A:	and these kids, um, you know, every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.
M:	Do they?
A:	Uh-huh. That's right. Absolutely. They need, young families, whatever,
M:	
A:	Yeah, so, TWIN PEAKS, um, what happened was, I think, TWIN PEAKS, um, went, went off, they moved to a Saturday night for a while. And then put, and then put something, I guess, GABRIEL'S FIRE on it, and at Thursday nights, and then they moved, um, no, GABRIEL'S FIRE was on C B S, I think, I, I take that back. I'm not sure, but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when PEAKS was back in that time slot as well. So, I don't know.
M:	I'd be willing to bet the majority of those guys are just as bad.
A:	Uh, my more exciting spots have been, I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
M:	Oh. That's pretty cool.
A:	Which one?
M:	You can't have your own land.
A:	Uh-huh. Well isn't,
M:	Well yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know, there's a place in Kansas that has a nursing home.
A:	Yeah.
M:	The U. S. Government is not the one that has to deal with the U.
A:	We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.
M:	If you're not going to pay for it, why not?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So. We've had this one, uh, so far.
A:	and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
M:	I do, uh, err, don't I
A:	Yeah.
M:	I know you are, but what am I?
A:	Yeah. I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
M:	I don't like you
A:	Yeah.
M:	I have. It's just that it's not on TV.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Yes, yes, yes.
A:	Isn't that a shame.
M:	It's not a story the police would tell you.
A:	And, uh, I don't know whether that's bad or good, it's just a point that I have observed that we,
M:	I...
A:	But she had, it was interesting, you know, I don't know how valid it is, but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement. Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year? Is there kind of a, you know, salads go first and things like that?
M:	But... I don't have any.
A:	Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	But... but... your garden?
A:	and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	so. So it gives you idea that,
M:	... That's not true at all.
A:	you know what I mean?
M:	That is a real place.
A:	So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.
M:	
A:	Yeah. No. *aa
M:	Heheelong
A:	Yeah.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	You can't tell me what to do.
A:	Oh, okay, I see.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You pay a LOT of taxes.not much
A:	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
M:	How do they justify this?
A:	Uh, I'm a research engineer, I work, uh, with Georgia Tech.
M:	I, er, say, mostly,
A:	That's great.
M:	There's a group for this
A:	No, mashed potatoes.
M:	That is true.
A:	That's right, you, you have to work on. You, really do.
M:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	Right, right. Right.
M:	Well, that's how I've always been, and I'm just not a good hitter.
A:	Yes.
M:	I think it's time to go to the doctor.
A:	Yeah, I agree, I, I've, I have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person. And, uh, as far as, uh, you know there are some, some other crimes that I think, uh, you know, uh, kidnapping, um, you know, when they, I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,
M:	i wanna be in it.
A:	He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical
M:	Well, there's
A:	and they are, um, of an advanced years, and when I see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid, I mean, the,  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
M:	I'm ahem.
A:	Yeah. I was just going to say.
M:	No, right.
A:	Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
M:	I like
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	It's just a bit of fun
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm a girl.
A:	and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush.
M:	I'm gonna have to go with, I think Chris.
A:	That is good.
M:	Nah. I'm a Vikings fan.
A:	They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
M:	I love
A:	both, yeah, both females, they're both spayed, um, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, um,
M:	Because, I can't see where the line is drawn.
A:	So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Well you are...
A:	and, uh,
M:	No. It was a joke.
A:	That's true.
M:	You are not disciplined.
A:	I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.
M:	It's ok.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
M:	Yeah, you.
A:	Uh, but yeah, that was, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
M:	He said he was, and I don't know, that he wasn't.
A:	So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.
M:	Ughuh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a gas and it's a natural.
A:	Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,
M:	And we have to move out of
A:	I just, I can't see that.
M:	I've never, ever used it
A:	It's, it's less painful and less expensive.
M:	You think?
A:	So you do that and, right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
M:	you.
A:	Have you, have, have you seen this often?
M:	I'm not sure.
A:	That's right. Yeah, that's, that's true too. That's true too.
M:	You can't tell me what to do!
A:	and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
M:	No, it's a fish.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's a potato?
A:	Yeah. Well, you may be right. What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, uh, we as a society deal with it and I, and I think it is, what you say, it's, it's a,
M:	Yes, I do
A:	Uh-huh. Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?
M:	That's true.
A:	Uh, I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
M:	You have a nice yard.
A:	Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.
M:	Did you have to leave?
A:	Yeah. Oh.
M:	This is a big problem.
