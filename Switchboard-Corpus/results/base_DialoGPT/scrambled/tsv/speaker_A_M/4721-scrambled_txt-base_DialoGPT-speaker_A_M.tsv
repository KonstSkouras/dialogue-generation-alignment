A:	Yeah. Yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.
M:	What's your car?
A:	and no two of them are alike And

M:	you,
A:	Well, he could always get past, you know, he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. But, um, I guess you never could really see him play, because with the Cowboys, while he was with the team, the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team. But, I don't know.
M:	I don't really use anything.
