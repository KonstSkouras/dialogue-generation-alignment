A:	Um, let's see. I think it was an hour. I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.
M:	I don't have to
A:	and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions. And, you know, it's I, I'm not saying that I do either but you know, it's just funny
M:	Is it a place?
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I was just reading an article in, uh, a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, uh, letters of applications to universities.
M:	It was an uh, snake.
A:	and it is hard to make, uh, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
M:	Do you have a brother?
A:	Do you think most states have that or?
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	And I spend most of my time carpooling
M:	That's a nice shirt.
A:	Well, that's right. But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends are that, um, the family unit is devaluated. It's not nearly as important.
M:	Yeah, I'm not really sure what that means.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You sound like you're in a bad place.
A:	Oh, don't you hate that? I've got a, I got a few pounds to lose myself. That's okay.
M:	That.about.it.it
A:	Uh-huh, you'd just do it.
M:	You '.
A:	Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
M:	No, I'm in Texas.
A:	and, um, I find great disgust in them, in their, in their, um, their self-centeredness and their inability to understand, um, multicultural or multiracial situation
M:	I'm not sure what that is
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a drug use test
A:	But, I used to work for a power company, so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
M:	Well, yeah.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	you
A:	Yes. If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.
M:	It's all the students, the students...
A:	Okay, well, it was good talking to you and have a good evening.
M:	You mean like family?
A:	But there's a,
M:	
A:	And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football. So,
M:	you?
A:	A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and, but I disagree with that, I.
M:	It's a little more than that, but I think it's a bit less than 1.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I've got a lot more money now.
A:	that's hard to say. Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
M:	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
A:	Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
M:	The only thing that is a problem is the US.
A:	And, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
M:	Did you like, sing the song?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a friend who's a doctor, and he's always surprised when he wakes up.
A:	Yeah. Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
M:	uhh, yes.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a lot of money
A:	any mass murderer type individual.
M:	I just eat a potato salad and, uh, eat it.
A:	an eel?
M:	I'm not.
A:	I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, but he does.
M:	I dunno, sometimes it's just weird.
A:	Well, I tell you I, I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in, in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
M:	No.
A:	I said so do I, I forgot about jazz
M:	We are paying for his services, so we are.
A:	and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things, so. I don't know, I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media
M:	She was already there.
A:	I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before, I've got, my garden is shaped that I can, it's kind like this, uh, box shape, so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
M:	It's a tragedy.
A:	Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
M:	I was just kidding.
A:	Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that. They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight and this is under something but,
M:	I
A:	uh,
