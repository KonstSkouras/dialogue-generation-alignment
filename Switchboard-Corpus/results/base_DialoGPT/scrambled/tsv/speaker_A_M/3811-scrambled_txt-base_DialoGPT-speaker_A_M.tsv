A:	Huh  That is good.
M:	And then there's the kids who are born to be teenagers.
A:	Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
M:	You can't
A:	Uh, not a whole lot, uh. I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
M:	Well, I guess it is.
A:	Yeah
M:	It was a manual.
A:	And Spanish is a lot like English.
M:	I don't understand what you mean.
A:	Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, I guess. I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan. Other than that, I mean, you know, when I've, you know, when you grow up in a city that has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it.
M:	It sounds, I'm, I know.
A:	And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.
M:	There is a difference between being penalized and being punished.
A:	True.
M:	There's not much time left.
A:	Yes, now we have watched some things on that.
M:	It's not even cocoa powder. It's chocolate.
A:	And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing. He's really caught on so that's really neat
M:	I think about?
A:	I do too.
M:	I hate
A:	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
M:	Oh, it's not. I'm not too sure about that, I don't think so.
A:	I like it.
M:	
A:	so I made the decision to put her in a nursing home, and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility. She had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and T V set
M:	What
A:	Yeah, he sure did.
M:	Umm... he
A:	Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more. I don't know that spending more always gets it.
M:	And what if we eat it?
A:	You owe it to yourself
M:	Uuhhhuhuhuh. Uhuhuh.You listen, uhuhuh
A:	Uh.
M:	It's not, because it never happened to him.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	How about an R8?
A:	I mean, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful
M:	So Chris?
A:	Well actually, I play, I play the violin in, in a string quartet that often plays at weddings.
M:	What about the fact that they never did away?
A:	do that, that's true.
M:	How does it
A:	Oh, how beautiful, and it's pretty flat there?
M:	I think we've got a few of them in the past.
A:	Mandatory just like, like the draft. No.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You okay?
A:	Yeah.
M:	You
A:	And the, so, but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, uh, you know, of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
M:	I think the point is that he has to be careful not to break in.
A:	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
M:	He was told by the doctor to stop.
A:	Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will
M:	She nods.
A:	we have found state parks, not that they're lacking but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner. You've got the showers available. It's not, you know, in the same category. State parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different. But, so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. That's the only time you really use your campground. If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
M:	How
M:	Well, we do have a thing for Italian food.
