A:	Yeah, I think that is an excellent program, I really do. I like that. And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.
M:	I, uh, I think they're right here.
A:	I think they're real reasonably priced, some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but I didn't get that one, I got the Black and Decker kind. But, uh, it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the the milk, you know, and it does an excellent job, or just hand beat it. I guess you could use a hand mixer but I don't think it I don't think it gets it good enough.
M:	They're
A:	Uh, State of Minnesota.
M:	I'm not even sure what to do.
A:	but now that she has one, she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit,
M:	You okay?
A:	Yeah.
M:	What do you think?
A:	There you go I don't know that's a different subject,  altogether
M:	I mean you.
A:	Huh.
M:	It's okay.
A:	So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
M:	I think I have the same car
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	How old is your oldest one?
A:	Of course, not.
M:	i.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm a kid.
A:	Yeah.  Yeah, I think, I mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. My dad, I think my, I'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works, but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.
M:	Uhh, I work in the Atlanta Public Library.
A:	Oh my gosh.
M:	I live in Canada
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Not sure
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But you have the choice of which one to pass it.
A:	It is kind of expensive, it is.
M:	Where is that?
A:	Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.
M:	Yeah, that's why I don't cook.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I was never, you know, you do, she was allright?
A:	And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting.
M:	That's what I was wondering.
A:	Yeah. Yes. No.
M:	I'm a student, but I'm not a student.
A:	You think that's great.
M:	So, uh, can I come?
A:	In Richardson there.
M:	u TheLolzLizard u thel 0n
A:	Different places every year. We,
M:	He nods and smiles Well, I am a girl.
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
M:	i.
A:	Uh-huh, which seems so awful.
M:	I like the ones that are the ones with the funny music
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know
A:	Up until, it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May.
M:	Uhh, no.
A:	And families took care of themselves and, um, but now, you know, people don't, they don't support each other that way.
M:	Oh, I didn't say that.
A:	Exactly. Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. For some reason I was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.
