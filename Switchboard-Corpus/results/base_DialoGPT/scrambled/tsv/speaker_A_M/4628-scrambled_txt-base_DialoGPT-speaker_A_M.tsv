A:	Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that. One thing,
M:	
A:	It, it sounds like, I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
M:	I'm sorry, I don't get it.
A:	And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too. I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.
M:	Yeah, the whole point of the movie is that the entire thing is a bit of a mess.
A:	I think that might be true.
M:	That's what I mean.
A:	True, true.
M:	I'm not.
A:	You feel it, don't you?
M:	
A:	They don't have any, they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know because we're all going to get old someday.
M:	Oh, you mean you're in Ohio
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What?
A:	Oh, yeah, well we're, we are on the dry side of the mountains. Seattle is only about two and a half hours, so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ugh, I'm so glad you said this.
A:	Uh-huh.  Yes.
M:	Theres a big difference between how expensive you can make it and how expensive the student loan is.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I am I'm so we're not, building prisons.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, that's good. I, I'm, you know, unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't, they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection
M:	Uhm.
A:	But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?
M:	You, uh, I'm pretty sure he's a man.
A:	That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
M:	Well, you can't really talk about that.
A:	That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.
M:	That's the thing, I can't read the yellow legal pad.
A:	And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
M:	You know, uh, that's pretty good.
A:	We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
M:	I can't read that.
A:	We, it is snowing right now. We're to get one to three inches tonight.
M:	lol
A:	Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
M:	You can get dental care at the dentist for free.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I think they're saying too.
M:	You're in New York?
A:	Yeah. Yeah, they I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado. Because, uh, I, I think about that a lot. But, you know, when I first moved here was when they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. This interstate seventy-five song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.
M:	You, he's
A:	And, uh, that really should be in your but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
M:	Wait, how did you get him to sign with the Giants?
