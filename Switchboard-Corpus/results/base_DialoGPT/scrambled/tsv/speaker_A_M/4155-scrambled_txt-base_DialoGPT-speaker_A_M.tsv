A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we have a daughter
A:	uh, I know in my case, I, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty-five
M:	You know, I've never heard of a room being able to be torn down.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You can recycle them.
A:	But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	He nods.
A:	Right, you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. But, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. Can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good.
M:	It's a town hall. It's not a church.
A:	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
M:	I'msigh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I was just talking about the movies.
A:	Yeah, I think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest
M:	No,
A:	Uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. And pylons and things.
M:	Well, they're not out on the street.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I am.
A:	Oh, yeah. Um.
M:	What is the joke?
A:	Yeah, I think the, uh, actually I think they get, um, some of them from South America.

M:	She's a good boy.
A:	Around a thousand.
M:	I, I, I don't understand
A:	Yeah.
M:	You like lasagna?
A:	And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work
M:	He's not a dog, he's a dog.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We,
A:	We would no longer need paper at all.
M:	I was. I'm not really a tourist though.
A:	Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know. Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
M:	Well, they do have a way to get you to shoot them...
A:	Yeah.
M:	They don't have a law against horses.
A:	I know, two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.

Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing. But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight
M:	well
A:	Its
M:	Oh. Uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I love the idea of a cat fighting a dog.
A:	And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so I can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too  so.
M:	Hehe
A:	And I'm kind of like, yeah. I shall, they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. That was going to use it for good, so,
