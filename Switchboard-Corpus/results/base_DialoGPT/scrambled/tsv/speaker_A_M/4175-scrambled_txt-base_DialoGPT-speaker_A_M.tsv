A:	Well, um, actually it, we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
M:	You, eh
A:	Yeah, they, they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they, about eight months ago they gave it to us.
M:	... we
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And then the police would just do it in prison.
A:	Oh, I like that too. But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
M:	Yeah, I think you're right.
A:	So that was really fun.
M:	Are you?
A:	Uh-huh. Back when they were in Saint Louis?
M:	Well, I guess that makes it okay then.
A:	I know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, I guess. Uh,
M:	So did they give us some of that deer?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's not that
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	Yeah, the, you, a to, the to, he's
A:	so.
M:	Umm, I do
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	...
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'll take the car if you have the money
A:	Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.
M:	
A:	they don't know that I don't use drugs. They just tested me once.
M:	No, I don t like rain.
A:	Right.
M:	L
A:	But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.
M:	I'm gonna say yes
A:	Yep.
M:	So she's not a brown eyed girl?
A:	and I, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
M:	we, they have, you,
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. But I think it would be a lot easier to do if we could just do it for the other ones.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You're, you're, it's, it was, it is
A:	Yeah, I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea, but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	but you're right, it is temporary. Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	I'm in Texas. Where are you?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Have you been to Europe?
A:	So those are the real killers. If he's just gone,
M:	What if you have a family and family members who would like to go home?
A:	I, I think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	I've never seen it like that before. How is it?
A:	Okay, I mean like business programs or, Man.
M:	It's hot and humid and humid.
A:	Uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
M:	See you soon
A:	Oh, well, anyway. Uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
M:	Oh, I just... I just love them.
A:	about, uh, like you say, using them, our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
M:	I'd like to see a picture of a real job
A:	Like I say it's just,
M:	What?
A:	Uh-huh. I see.
M:	Oh uh uh uh, uh uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes.
A:	Yeah, yeah, well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.
M:	Uhhh, you don't know what a joke is.
A:	I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
M:	If you could, sure.
A:	And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
M:	What's the other thing?
A:	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
M:	And, uh, I think, you know, and
A:	I really, I really like the Mercedes.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	I, I
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hmmm.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But I'm going to the game!
A:	Uh, oh, I think, we're, we're supposed to hang up.
M:	Don't you hate it when your own child cries?
A:	But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
M:	We've got four bedrooms, because we're the one that got hit by a car.
A:	Oh, really? Oh. You really rough it then.
M:	I'll be right there with you. I'm going to get a ticket for this.
A:	and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It,
M:	I, uh, uh
A:	For music?
M:	I'm not,
A:	And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
M:	I did.
A:	Oh.
M:	You
A:	I think, Yes.
M:	Yeah, I know.
