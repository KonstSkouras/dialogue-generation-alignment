A:	I just, again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be. I,
M:	Wait, when do we get the frost?
A:	Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
M:	Well, that's the problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not going to lie. She's not going back to work.
A:	Huh?
M:	The only people that have ever gotten health care in this country are the ones who have been living in this city for generations.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, it's a felony.
A:	Oh, yeah, I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that, that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,
M:	I
A:	The rest of it is just like wild flowers
M:	
A:	However, I'm sure they're there.
M:	Have you seen the movie?
A:	It's exciting.
M:	I'll, yuh, money
A:	Yeah.   Yeah.  Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
M:	I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I do.
A:	Well, I have a friend who's the same way, and anything below sixty, she's just not happy but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, my husband's from Nebraska, and they have more of the four seasons.
M:	
A:	Definitely.
M:	
A:	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg .
M:	uhh... I think I know what you mean.
A:	When they're skiing they're fearless, and they go off,
M:	No, I'm, uh, I am.
A:	I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
M:	Have you been to a place?
A:	and you, and you, you know the,
M:	They're not getting anything for them.
A:	It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic we just do, oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
M:	I'm not saying they don't, I'm just saying
A:	Well, it's also important, I think, um, for my husband. I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, um, some time with them.
M:	That's
A:	Well, you ready for New Year's Eve?
M:	'
A:	Okay. We don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
M:	Uhh, it's been a while.
A:	Uh-huh almost cruel for him to, to walk.
M:	Oh yeah, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm fine.
A:	They look like, Yeah, they seem like a tennis ball but it almost doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah, the best I, I don't think I could, I, I could handle those tennis balls. So, what else to you tape besides AMERICAN at, there anything else?
M:	I see.
A:	That's true.
M:	yes.
A:	but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
M:	Yeah, and they are making the stuff in the air.
A:	and some, some of them did quit the company.
M:	Vision, I think it's a great idea.
A:	You don't like the cold. Well, I usually like it about sweater weather, and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.
M:	He is my father
A:	Oh.
M:	I would be a little, I could be, you
A:	Huh.
M:	So, it's your job?
A:	we have, you know, you can't just, just hope for abstinence.
M:	
A:	and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really, I mean they're, they're happier when we're around but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves, um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
M:	I have you pay a million dollars.
A:	Right. They don't have one of those. So, it, we decided that was it, you know, and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card. We have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not going to say.
A:	Well, I had never been there, that's pretty neat. My sisters both seem to like it pretty well. My brother-in-law works for the University, um, in Dallas. He's admissions director. Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.
M:	Why are you talking about the internet?
A:	And they bought their home in I, I want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that, and they paid like, they, they had it built from, you know, they, they designed it and everything, and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it, and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
M:	So
A:	But there wasn't a, it was strange, it was kind of sad, there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.
M:	Is it a breeding problem?
A:	I don't think I would like that. What kind?
M:	Are you a native?
A:	Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
M:	Is that a real cocoa powder?
A:	So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that.
M:	I mean, what would be the point of voting for you?
A:	Gosh.
M:	You're
A:	Yeah.
M:	Uhhhuh. Uh
A:	actually it, ours is on at eleven it, it's, um, eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here in New York. Um, I think they they do that, I think they put things on at, um, eleven o'clock here and I think they put it like eleven o'clock, um, California time, like in California but in the middle they sort of, um, like central time or mountain time they, they push things back. So, I was actually, actually I'm not sure , I was in, I was in Iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier, so, does your prime time start at seven o'clock?
M:	2.
A:	You would still have something.
M:	What about her nose?
A:	And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from the from South America, and Central America.
M:	They arent. They are in the garden.
A:	Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,
M:	'
A:	Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,
M:	I've got a hunch.
A:	amount of people eat, *listen and then say, man this is really good,
M:	Are they changing?
A:	And I don't know if they decided to do, or not, but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that. Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point,  without charging people.
M:	They are in the same house.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh yea, yes
