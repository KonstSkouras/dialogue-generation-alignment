A:	Uh-huh.
M:	This
A:	Uh-huh. You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
M:	You, the...
A:	Oh, gee.
M:	Yeah, it's a good thing, I find it odd that some people are against healthcare in general.
A:	Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.
M:	... I'm a girl.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	what.
A:	Right.
M:	
A:	The Legend. Uh.
M:	then
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But... we did draw up our budget...
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'll take the free kitten
A:	and my husband and I actually met in a computer company. Um, I was a tech writer and he was an engineer. And, uh, so I did tech writing for a number of years.
M:	Yeah. I think it's really 
A:	is that suppose to be.
M:	Oh I see. So she was in high school
A:	but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
M:	We are all in the same place, right?
A:	Oh, no, I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, do you know?
M:	...
A:	and we would have to, we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and, That's a good family place to go,
M:	I don't think I've ever had a cup of water in a bath.
A:	No, that's okay
M:	What do you think?
A:	Probably so. Yeah, you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	I'm not gonna lie, I cried.
A:	Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too. .
M:	i
A:	and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
M:	Oh, I'm in Durham.
A:	um, to don't, Adam, talking to um City,
M:	It's white paper.
A:	But I
M:	We've been to every summer since we were kids.
A:	Uh, what are you thinking about buying?
M:	...
A:	True, true.
M:	
A:	That's right.
M:	I like it.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	It's, is, uh, is
A:	and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
M:	It's a little more of a chore.but, I'm trying to get out of it
A:	and somebody will turn it in and, and nothing will be missing. They said they can just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that. I thought, boy, in America, if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.
M:	I'm not the one who owns the house.
A:	and, So,
M:	It's just, it's.
A:	Watch me.
M:	But I like it.
A:	so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,
M:	You know, I never said I was.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, it's just a bit of fun.
A:	Yeah. Really.
M:	I would be shocked if they did. They could easily make it a policy.
A:	Yes.
M:	They haven't even made a film of it.
A:	Yeah, keep it there
M:	
A:	Uh, in parts. I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.
M:	I think I know.
A:	I, I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
M:	I'm not sure. I don't know.
A:	And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that, but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
M:	You don't think?
A:	Uh, not too much. Uh, I got a bit. Actually,
M:	You know, that.
A:	We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
M:	?
A:	Uh-huh. Well, they, they just don't do that any more.
M:	So what do we do now?
A:	That don't, it , it, it seems like, I mean, if wrestling is prime time, professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a wrestling to me, I don't, I don't see any difference though,
M:	Hm? I don't understand.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	They should just release it on the 14th.
A:	and he's, you know, a lot of wisdom in it. And the kids at BIBLE talk about anything but training, and training is different than anything else in, in psychology doesn't address it. A lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE and they don't quote you the proverb out of it, but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the BIBLE and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
M:	Uhh, it's a Cadillac
A:	That will be interesting.
M:	It's a German Shepherd, so it's a breed.
A:	and I think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because I come from nice middle class white suburban home
M:	...
A:	Yeah.
M:	Are you serious?
A:	That would be really great.
M:	What is that?
A:	And, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired, and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
M:	I don't think they can be a'school '
A:	No, they're just mutts,
M:	I don't, I don t, I'm just here to help.
A:	Most of the time
M:	You can't even get rid off the bears in the wild.
A:	Is that right? That's it?
M:	I know.
A:	But she got credits for it?
M:	Yes, but you can't have a skunky.
A:	Oh, that's, my husband's into, uh, computers.
M:	Yeah, I
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I
A:	You know, you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever. And I know that, that the Southeast Asians, the Hmong people that I've done some work with, uh, feel very quite hurt and, and unsure of themselves when here. Because they're coming from, you know, from the slash and burn intercultural society, you know, they're coming from the middle ages, basically. And they're being plunked down, plunked down into America. Many of them had been promised by the C I A, during the war over there, that because they co-operated with the C I A, and they helped the C I A out, that when they came here, the C I A would help establish them in America, and the C I A, of course, isn't doing that.
M:	
A:	Uh, I've, I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society, uh, there's very little full employment. Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off.
M:	yeah,?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a lot of fun
A:	Huh.
M:	It's in California.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, um, uh... I like it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Why would I?
A:	What, what do you do?
M:	I'm sure
A:	It was a joy in talking with you.
M:	
A:	and we've, we have been to Whistler in Canada, which is just a marvelous place, Whistler and Black Home is in Canada, and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times, that's a, just a great place. But no not in Colorado since I was in college, since I went to school,
M:	So you're saying you don't like it?
A:	Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	I'm not sure, I think they were like three fifty.
A:	Anyway, it's a tough question.
M:	He smiles and smiles back
A:	Sure.
M:	It's called being a judge.
A:	Who wrote that?
M:	Ummm... How do you make soup?
A:	Um. Boy I like that.
M:	Did you read it?
A:	Yeah, it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected.
M:	Yes, then, a, is, and, and?
A:	No, I've done some walking with friends in the past.
M:	Uhh, uh, they're all over the place.
A:	Yeah, that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
M:	
A:	Yeah, ours is on,
M:	Thanks
A:	Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes, and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
M:	It's a joke
A:	And they don't look at it so much as, you know,
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I,
A:	don't tell me what to do, you know.
M:	do you have any onions?
A:	Nursing homes.
M:	I'm a doctor.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We should all be thankful for this.
A:	So, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.
M:	Well, I'm sure that's why I'm still in school.
A:	And, uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
M:	I have a bit, I'
A:	And, uh.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.  Yeah.
M:	Uh, we have a lot of flowers, we just don't have the time to plant them
A:	Huh, well,
M:	That's...
A:	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
M:	So what's the backstory?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I'm from East Texas.
M:	Umm. Uh huh.
