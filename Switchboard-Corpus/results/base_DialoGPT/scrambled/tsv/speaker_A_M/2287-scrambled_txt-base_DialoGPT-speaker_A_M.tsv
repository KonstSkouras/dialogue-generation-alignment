A:	What did you do, put it together?
M:	No, I'm sorry.
A:	I called everyone I knew, I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.
M:	This is the most important thing for me.
A:	this is not, these aren't cats, you know,
M:	I'm glad you
A:	No, I live in Maryland.
M:	They're coming to the Louisville area next week. I'm not sure what part of the city they're going to be in.
A:	my mother got a piano and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, so we all had to take lessons, and I was the one that did the least poorly, so she gave it to me. And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. It is real relaxing.
M:	Why is the air so cold?
A:	and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
M:	h?
A:	Yeah.
M:	And then?
A:	Yeah.
M:	You're, we've been, we.
A:	Huh.
M:	You have a lot of work to do in the area.
A:	It sounds nice.
M:	That's what you're supposed to do with your first language, not your first meal.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	They're not.
A:	Well how many rooms do you think, yeah?
M:	Yes, you can
A:	So he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
M:	Is that a question?
A:	Oh. Uh, I had, I had a dog one time, and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed
M:	Have u ever?
A:	Yes.
M:	That,
A:	Uh-huh.  Is it, uh, how about the injection,
M:	Are you still here?
A:	Uh, when we were in Australia, uh, sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore, and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.
M:	He nods.
A:	Yeah, I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh, he's not the only one,  you know,
M:	I like to eat it with my
A:	To, to compensate for some of the benefits.
M:	I can make you eat a lot of food, uh, food.
A:	I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
M:	Uhh, I don't think you understand.
A:	and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course we water a little bit, that's just too much to water all at once, but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
M:	I don't.
A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
M:	Uuhhh, how come?
A:	Oh, really.
M:	No, they are not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know if it gives you any confidence.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. And what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
M:	It's not like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think it's because of taxes.
A:	Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know, when you cook a package, it's, it's a little less,
M:	Well, I am an engineer.
A:	so many, uh, women are heads of state and I, you know, we, we keep saying oh yes, we feel some day a woman will be president. But, uh, I have some question, whether or not they will ever really get around to that. I think we'll have a black president before we have a women president.
M:	LOLPT : ummm
A:	Oh, I agree. I think that people are getting off too easy. They're getting, they're getting paroled too easily.
M:	Uhh, I think you might have the wrong person here.
A:	Oh, really. It's hard.
M:	Yea I know.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Alright, see ya later
A:	But they seem to like it okay. I think they're too far away from me, but maybe some day they can get closer,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. That's right. I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, you know,
M:	Maybe. But I wouldn't say that.
A:	Yeah. Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.
M:	I just had a kitten.
A:	So.
M:	They can't, they're, you know, the only, other, other...
A:	Well, it's not too new.
M:	The only thing I can think of is that there are no guns in the area.
A:	Yeah. It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if, as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do . Worked out really well for us too.
M:	Mormons. Not a lot of them.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I
A:	Gosh, small world, huh?
M:	They're not.
A:	Well, that sounds interesting. I bet he's enjoyed having it that way
M:	So...
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It would be handy.
M:	No, it's not.
A:	Well, I think that's all I have to say.
M:	Why?
A:	Oh.
M:	We weren't in the snow?
A:	Uh-huh, well you,
M:	I'm
A:	Uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
M:	Why not?
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers. Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
M:	
A:	That's right, uh-huh.
M:	What?
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I'm not afraid of your kind.
M:	You serious?
