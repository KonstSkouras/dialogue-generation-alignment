A:	Oh, boy, I bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
M:	That, work.
A:	But, that's been, it's been fun, I mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun, it's been fun, I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano. I've learned a lot about playing the piano.
M:	Ah. I didn't get that.
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
M:	Oh, so you're just being weird then.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Oh. Well I don't have any good ideas.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhm.
A:	And unless you really like, uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
M:	U
A:	Yeah, that's true. But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,
M:	
A:	is that and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
M:	We do have the most.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You've never seen a 3 car garage?
A:	but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card. And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh, well, I'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.
M:	Not really, the supreme court doesn't appeal the appeal.
A:	Uh, as a course for P E you know so I could graduate.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's not that hard.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, do, do you think that's good or bad?
M:	What's?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Carbon fuel
A:	Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it I just, I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh,
M:	It's all good. The political issues are far from being a bad thing.
A:	Yeah.
M:	German Shepherds are a breed of dog.
A:	I just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done.
M:	I, uh, I can't.
A:	Um, I found out too, that, uh, quite often if I see something on television that I want more in-depth, uh, understanding or, or get, want to know more about it, that the, the newspaper or, uh, I read NEWSWEEK, can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V, but, uh, um, I found out that also on, on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on C N N and, and like you said, the, the news shows that are, that are happening, and you can read some more about it if you want to. Um, I found out, though that, or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the newspapers is negative. There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news, or, or bad news. And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
M:	Uh, we have a lot in common.
A:	Yeah. But they're not doing bad. People are pretty surprised that they, I mean they beat the Giants.
M:	I
A:	Well, yes.
M:	you mean they don t get outta the house?
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	It's a lot easier to have a good relationship with your siblings than to have them be spoiled.
A:	Oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway. Would you not?
M:	The, have you
A:	But, uh,  Yeah, but, I mean, a, a, a lot of people would get involved and, you know, because there were all different, organizations to do. There was Big Brother, Big Sister,
M:	i, uh, i, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, is your brother younger than you or,
M:	That's what I thought.
A:	That's interesting. Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhuhuh. That's a bit different.
A:	And they always have surprises for you.
M:	Uhhh, and, uh, teacher, who's the teacher?
A:	Oh, yeah? What kind of programs do you,
M:	Oh... that's so nice.
A:	Uh, that's terrible.
M:	It's cool.
A:	Yeah.
M:	They wouldn't, they'd have, you know, the best of intentions.
