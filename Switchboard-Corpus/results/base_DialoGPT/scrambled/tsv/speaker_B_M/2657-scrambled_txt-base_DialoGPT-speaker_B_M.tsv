B:	Right, right. Yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...
M:	No. Not really.
B:	Huh.
M:	Because, I think, a lot people, uh, depends on how much money I have
B:	Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off.
M:	How about you?
B:	Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my, what I was going to study
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	No.
M:	I mean, the guy was a senator in Louisiana
B:	Uh-huh. Have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of time?
M:	Well, I don't have kids, so...
B:	but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit. Uh, my daughter lives in Arlington, and when I go to visit her, I love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to Southern Virginia or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although I don't do that regularly.
M:	He looks so happy!
B:	Yeah, haven't either.
M:	oh, yeah
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Okay, okay.
B:	and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.
M:	You can't, you can't win a Super Bowl in a season.
B:	and I totaled them all up and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
M:	And you?
B:	Right. The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
M:	You know
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	It's not that expensive.
B:	Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad
M:	I can't even start a farm, so it's just a farm
B:	So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.
M:	You're not getting out.
B:	Oh yes, yes.
M:	Right. So, uh, they'll fix it.
B:	and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.
M:	Is the...
B:	You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.
M:	Oh, uh
B:	Bye.
M:	There is no problem.
B:	But you're married?
M:	I was in middle school and i had no idea. I have no idea what I want to do.
B:	What
M:	Uhh, what?
B:	What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
M:	So, what are the requirements for a moderator?
B:	I live out in the country, yeah.
M:	I know I'm a minority, but I love this show.
B:	Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
M:	Well
B:	That's absolutely right. It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot, is, is definitely not acceptable.
M:	It's a golden retriever
B:	Did you sue him under the civil system?
M:	
B:	Right.
M:	I don't?
B:	Which was real nice. I got married, uh, during the Christmas season and we played, uh, old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not, and it was real nice, I liked that a lot.
M:	I think it's going to be a good
B:	Something like that.
M:	I'm going to say it. We're going to have to pay you more than you think you will.

M:	Yes. It's a good garden area.
B:	Oh, do you? So you live in Garland then.
M:	How'd you cut it?
B:	and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.
M:	I've never heard of this before, but I can't help but wonder what it is.
B:	No, we don't have anything right now.
M:	It's pretty hard to not feel like you've accomplished something
B:	Uh, his name is T Q or something like that. And my notebook is somewhere around here See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.
M:	Uh huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, well, I'm just a school teacher.
B:	Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
M:	i.
B:	I know, and that makes me so mad You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently
M:	I'm in the same boat.
B:	and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
M:	I think of course.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, um, the school is just a bunch of people with a lot of experience and experience.
