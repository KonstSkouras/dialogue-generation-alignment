B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know,
B:	I love gardens that are well tended, and I just, there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers, and just, I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long. And, uh, I, I was in England once, and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it. You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.
M:	I dunno, I don't really eat meat.
B:	And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping. And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and I told him,
M:	I don't really like the sound of the new album, but I love the new one.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Yeah, they just had the baby's christening so,
M:	You're not in a position to make decisions about it, you're a person.
B:	and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in this, in the, in this schoolyard there. So we just said, hey, let's stop and and the kids got to go around and, you know, see pigs and animals and things like that,
M:	Uhm... I don't know.
B:	Well.
M:	What about New York?
B:	Strange.
M:	I don't think so, I got a deal
B:	Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,
M:	right.
B:	I know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
M:	East Texas
B:	Some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
M:	I read
B:	it's  like I say, it's not a lot, but it helps people. Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
M:	I'm off
B:	and,  uh, somebody is on the premises
M:	That's what I said.
B:	We only see the tip of the iceberg only.
M:	You have to have some kind of special relationship with me to be an adult.
B:	And I've never been sorry,
M:	Yeah. It's pretty common.
B:	and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Yes.
M:	A lot of people do.
B:	Huh.
M:	I've been reading it.
B:	Uh-huh. Sure, yeah.
M:	Oh.Chris?
B:	And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible. So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this. So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be. Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian,
M:	I'm in the same boat. I'm going to hang out with my mom.
B:	Okay,  nice talking to you.
M:	Because the justice system is flawed.
B:	Oh, I love it
M:	Umm, uh, uh.,. Uh, uh?
B:	Uh-huh.  Wow, that's cute.  That's neat, yeah.  When you,
M:	You guys are weird.
B:	and, um, so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored, and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time,
M:	You don't think most States have capital
B:	Like aluminum cans?
M:	I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's a good idea.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
M:	Yeah. I've been struggling along that line lately.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	
B:	and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,
M:	
B:	and then you go over and release it and then it just, it just drops, you know.
M:	I guess. You?
B:	But we're not into that. We're into like, have to have it all now.
M:	Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I thought you were being sarcastic
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	Why
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	that's what, that's what people face with that choice. One thing I really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know, they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know,
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uhhh, I think I'm in love now.
B:	Yeah. And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know so much as, we just want to help people out.
M:	You're
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They're not married.
B:	You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think.
M:	Good. I'm glad you're okay.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Hmm, I wonder if they're expensive.
B:	We did, I did horseback riding, too, in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses and, uh, that was kind of for them, but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, we always had horses around, and I really enjoyed that,
M:	
B:	Right. Right. Oh, definitely motherhood is devalued in this society. If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's like what a waste. People think, you know, you should be fulfilling yourself
M:	so... do they have a secret?
B:	Wow.
M:	It's not about feeling good. It's about feeling happy.
B:	Isn't that nice. I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,
M:	I mean, the kids'parents have a responsibility to take care of them.
B:	And then just bake it, and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.
M:	Uh
B:	Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle
M:	Uhh, she works in a restaurant, part time, part of a family.
B:	Uh, yeah. They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company.
M:	Where are you?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I,,, I think,, you,, got it.
B:	Oh. Oh, good.
M:	I've lived here for almost 5 years and it is the best place on earth.
B:	When he retired?
M:	That's the worst I've ever seen.
B:	And he's like oh, thank you so much.
M:	Yeah, but you're not a guy
B:	And is it, um, a natural gas and,
M:	I
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	...
B:	Her eyes are changing,
M:	Lawyer and doctor make the least money in my country.And.they don't.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm paying.
B:	Well, it was nice to talk to you. I know they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives. They pick up newspapers, I think.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	Say out, instead of out you say out. Did you know that?
M:	Are you sure?
