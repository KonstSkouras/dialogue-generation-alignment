M:	I have to get to my car, so I'm going to be taking the bus.
B:	An, it, an I feel bad for the policeman, because he's out there every day facing these people. This, this craziness, you know, people with, uh, automatic weapons and, uh, all this other stuff and trying to do a job
M:	I,
B:	They're real good, but they do come on kind of late, but we really do enjoy those. Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.
M:	They're everywhere.
B:	How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
M:	It's a question, but it's not really a question.
B:	No, they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot, but they make it through probably winter and spring. So,
M:	Are you single?
B:	Yeah, yeah
M:	I don't need it.
B:	Right, yeah.
M:	Just stop.
B:	Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated, and it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.
M:	So what are you trying to say?
B:	Yeah.
M:	Ohhh, that's awesome.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, I'm sure.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I was there.

M:	He smiles back I know. I just think it's funny how it seems like he has no problem with it.
B:	Now when was that, when were you there?
M:	Oh, she was beautiful.
B:	No.
M:	Yeah, I was.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think it's the other way around.

B:	And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
M:	I'm not sure if you are saying that, but it's not that I don't want to be murdered, I'm saying I would rather be rehabilitated.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	... wait, do you have any relatives in Virginia?
B:	Oh, uh-huh, yeah, and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be.
M:	You mean the NFC South.
B:	Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?

M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah, you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.
