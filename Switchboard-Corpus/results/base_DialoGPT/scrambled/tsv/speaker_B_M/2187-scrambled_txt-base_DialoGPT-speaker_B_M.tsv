B:	Uh, you're very fortunate.
M:	If you're driving on the right, you can go down.
B:	and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.
M:	I'm not sure what's wrong with it
B:	Yes.
M:	I don't, but
B:	I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,

B:	Uh, yeah, although she is, uh, in pretty good health and she's, doesn't take any medication, it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.
M:	ohh, well I'm a very pretty girl.
B:	I have not gone back lately. In fact, uh, this past Sunday was the, was the reunion, but I did not get to go. Uh, I have,
M:	I'm going to hold you to that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're allowed to do things?
B:	you do not really feel that that really close to them.
M:	It's not like she's going to get out of bed or anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I've seen this before,
B:	I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know. If it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was innocent and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
M:	We have some in the kitchen
B:	"To operate, yeah.  But, you know, people are buying them. You know whose buying them? *""whose"" = who's"" The power company.  Free, you know, free for them."
M:	Yeah
B:	and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh,
M:	I was at the game and it was pretty loud
B:	I guess,
M:	... so?
B:	Yeah,
M:	It's not a problem.it's a problem.
B:	I have a friend who has one and, and he lets me, you know, no problem borrowing if it's, just a hassle when you know, to go up

B:	The the one week uh seven day the delay
M:	That's so sweet.
B:	Um, I don't know who else I've ever. That's about it, I was always a Viking fan. I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit and,

M:	It's in Texas.
B:	Yeah, that, that Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.
M:	I think he should be evaluated.
B:	Yes.
M:	Well, I can't say I'm very impressed by the quality of the high school students, but it's a school.
B:	I tape it. But I understand, uh, that in England, they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent, and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program.
M:	You know, I'm pretty sure the amount of time that's going to be spent
B:	I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
M:	...
B:	Yeah. Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures People, um, you know, just go on and on and on. I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care or, and it just extends with if it, what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous, you know, burden on the taxpayers.

B:	Yeah. Right.
M:	No. No. No.No.No.
B:	Oh, wow.
M:	No, but you can.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
M:	
B:	He,
M:	I'm sorry
B:	I'll let you lead out.
M:	It's like a million dollars or something.
B:	Yeah, it depends. Sure. Uh, so you don't, uh, if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?
M:	Umm... and I always think it's funny when people say they disagree with me.

M:	Did you hear the Richardson?
B:	I can't believe that I, I'm just thankful that I don't get all the government that I pay for.
