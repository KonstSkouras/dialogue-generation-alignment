B:	uh, just not, I have a younger daughter now and, uh, I, it's kind of hard to get her, get her there, and everything.
M:	I know, I'm not.
B:	But now that my, my, uh, youngest sister's at B Y U now, and so they have no one at home, she's back teaching school full time now, again. So if, you know, it's not, it's just a temporary thing.
M:	It's not.
B:	Is that right?
M:	OH.
B:	Yeah.
M:	No, you're just
B:	Um, uh-huh
M:	You can
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You were born in 1988.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can have my daughter if you want.
B:	Well, that's happened before.
M:	I work at home.
B:	Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
M:	
B:	Really.
M:	No, it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	How do I'm going to vote, now.
B:	Yeah. So now they're like marking, uh, they're, I don't know, there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.
M:	I'm not really, I'm,
B:	Yeah, except for time in service.
M:	You can't
B:	I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
M:	I don't
B:	God. That's pretty good.
M:	My mom has a house in my house. I don't know if I could stand in it.
B:	Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in, in the entire D C area. I'm, I'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of Washington D C, and Montgomery County, Maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to,
M:	I know. I'm just saying that he was sentenced to death.
B:	The west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so.
M:	I know...
B:	No one would want the job
M:	I have some?
B:	Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,
M:	No, I mean like, I'm not the only one
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
M:	Do you think the government is more responsible for the poor than the poor?
B:	Oh.
M:	i
B:	I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
M:	But it's a good thing!
B:	And she got kind of fearful of being on her own. She never really ate very well. It was one thing. She hardly  ever took care of herself
M:	I'm not going to answer that question, you're not the same guy.
B:	I, I shouldn't say innocent, because I mean, actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but,
M:	Oh, you, there were no
B:	Uh, oh, golly, I really.
M:	He's a very big dog. He's only 8 weeks old.
B:	Yes Yes. Yeah.
M:	I'm waiting for them to finish my graduate year, I'm so nervous.
B:	I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here.
M:	uhhhh. you're not gonna get away with this.
B:	Well, we live, uh, pretty close, to the Mesquite Golf Course.
M:	You don
B:	Uh-huh. I was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. And so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
M:	I have a lot of stuff you can use.
B:	Oh, super.
M:	What do you do?
B:	but she seems to.
M:	I'm pretty sure it's a big deal.
B:	We do
M:	I don't know, are you?
B:	Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
M:	That's a lot of money.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	That's what I thought.
B:	And what do you have.
M:	I'm sure the insurance company has some insurance to deal with that.
B:	Oh, yeah
M:	I know what you mean. But if they're going to try to do that, they should do it.
B:	Yeah, it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
M:	Ohhhh, uh, yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah. Well, most of my camping, I haven't done much since I was a kid but, uh, we'd, basically, take the tent up in the Sierras and, uh, usually just camp near some stream  or some lake.
M:	I am, uhh, I'm not.
B:	I do, too. I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that. And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out. I think that's good and,
M:	Well I guess that's the law
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... and, and, you know,
B:	and this, eventually things just went too far
M:	Do you think that's how it works?
B:	And all the civil rights people are up arms about it, you know.
M:	That's what I was saying.
B:	but I don't know that there's a real, uh,
M:	You would love Morocco.
B:	It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.
M:	It's awwwwwww.
B:	I've never seen you before Who are you?
M:	It's okay.
B:	they don't warp.
M:	... You know, I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah. I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean. They're not worth it
M:	They are.
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
M:	That.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're right.
B:	Yeah, it is a tough question.
M:	It
B:	Right. Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, yeah, a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.
M:	Um... um... what?
B:	Right, yeah.
M:	Should be paid?
B:	Yeah, yeah, I, I use that for for rice and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.
M:	
B:	And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
M:	Well, I mean, there are a lot of people that are a part of the community.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I am
B:	and that was the most boring place on earth.
M:	Have you ever heard of the mountain?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	no, i haven't
B:	I guess. But we're going to try that, and see how that works.
M:	Not really. I mean, I have a laptop and mouse, but I can't use the mouse anymore.
B:	I like it better, I think.
M:	I don't think I'll ever be able to afford that.
B:	But, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh, like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.
M:	Yea, I'll have a better word for it
B:	Oh, how wonderful.
M:	I mean, it really helps.
B:	And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, but I still feel, you know, it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something
M:	I can't even think of a way to get it.
B:	But, uh,
M:	...
B:	And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
M:	Well, there's plenty of full employment in the US.
B:	So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
M:	Why do you think?
B:	Bye.
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	Not in Dallas, Texas.
B:	What about you?
M:	It's not like it's hard to
B:	Well,
M:	I've never heard of a group of people doing that.
B:	That's right. I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,
M:	Okay. So you're not, huh?
B:	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
M:	the.the.dogs.are.good.
B:	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know. And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.
M:	It's been a long time.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
M:	This.
B:	No.
M:	...
B:	Yeah, I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, uh, don't travel too much .
M:	Um, I'm not sure. I don't think I know what you're talking about.
B:	I really like those, in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding.
M:	I am.
B:	And.
M:	Ohhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	They can recycle, and you can get them back.
B:	and they plan the reunions, the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer. Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.
M:	So, why are they so hostile?
B:	Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then?  Yeah,  yeah.
M:	I'm gonna go with dogs.
B:	Okay, yeah. Well you just do,
M:	What? I was saying you live in Clarion county.
B:	Oh, I know it The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful.
M:	The work schedule.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, but, you know, it's in the title.
B:	You're kidding!  No kidding!  Uh-huh.
M:	Do they have a lot of kids?
B:	I know and see a credit card
M:	...
B:	Oh, boy, that's frustrating.
M:	He was born with a mouth, and therefore, he can't speak.
B:	Huh.
M:	When you, when they, switch
B:	I don't know
M:	I mean, you could say that about any job.
B:	If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools.
M:	Oh, there's a lot of people who are dying, we're just losing some.
B:	Oh, that's pretty good.
M:	You're the best.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field. And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits. Uh, I've worked for, for for awhile and they are, you know, a really academic type of place. And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. And then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff. So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid and, you know, some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits and so, yeah, I would
M:	I would.
B:	Um. Wow.
M:	What?
B:	but usually it's not until later It's really strange.
M:	I'm sorry, but what is the point of this?
B:	And that, that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
M:	It is...
B:	Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
M:	Uhhhuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I dunno.
B:	Yes, it would almost have to be, I suppose. If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
M:	You have to admit it, that is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.
B:	Yeah,  yeah.
M:	You were in the marching band, right?
