M:	I dunno.
B:	But that's, uh, they're, so close, I, I don't consider Mexican people in the same category with, uh, especially like, uh, people who come from cultures that don't have the same, uh, kind of moral upbringing that we have.
M:	Uu do it's just, do, do it
B:	And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because we're so close to D C anyway.
