B:	Yes, yes. I agree.
M:	You know, I have a lot of friends.
B:	So you think that would be a deterrent?
M:	Ah, so it was.
B:	Uh, my home is, well, is typical for the area. I live in a development, uh, it's a relatively, I would say, well, God, it sounds like, sounds like I'm bragging
M:	I've been sorry
B:	And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it. So, you know,
M:	Maybe you can make a list of all the things that have been done in the past?
B:	So again, it never really penalizes,  the company doing the wrong.
M:	I
B:	and.
M:	What happened?
B:	So they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
M:	Are you going to be able to pay for yourself?
B:	Um. Ooh, this is a beneficial call. I like this
M:	I think.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You know
B:	Remember Jim Hart? Jim Hart was playing. Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals. This was a long time ago.
M:	I mean, you could just sit around, they don't have to pay you
B:	I really don't watch that much T V, what I do is I tape the programs I want to watch, and then on the nights I can watch, I'll pick out something.
M:	I'm not
B:	but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
M:	What?
B:	Well flower gardens. I like to have, matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. So, those ought to be coming up around spring time
M:	I don't.
B:	Well let me ask you this then.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
M:	There's a lot of houses in the neighborhood
B:	I'd like to try, you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before
M:	Yea. It was a terrible race
B:	Right.
M:	Well?
B:	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
M:	Nope. You don't.
B:	Really?
M:	I know, but it's on the computer in my room.
B:	The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
M:	Oh, I'm not the only one.
B:	I know, and I think, I think that's ridiculous.
M:	The most interesting thing about me is that I have never been on acid.
B:	You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know. I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.
M:	But, uh, you don't have to say that.
B:	Um, I'm twenty.
M:	It's been forever.
B:	but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
