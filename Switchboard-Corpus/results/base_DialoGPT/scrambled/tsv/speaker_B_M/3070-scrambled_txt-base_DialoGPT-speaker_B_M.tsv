B:	That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.

B:	Yeah, it is tough. It's, and I don't know who's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on implementing it, if they do.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do they do?
B:	I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, and it just continues to get worse.
M:	Oh, well.
B:	And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have.
M:	I've been on the train to him since I was a kid.
B:	But,
M:	I use it to write.it.very.very good.it is.good.it
B:	That's always a good thing. Vegetable trays always go over so well, because I think people get tired of eating junk. I mean, I think they like to have healthy stuff too, you know it's,
M:	I know. I know.
B:	I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
M:	That.
B:	Um, Kalachandji's. It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
M:	Well, you are an E E S l teacher.Well, they teach you how to go around helping people learn another languages.
B:	You
M:	This.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's uh, not.
B:	Uh-huh.

B:	Really. Gosh.
M:	What do you mean, I have, I, I've been to, you know, the moon.
B:	Oh, well they'll, weed him out.
M:	...
B:	Right, and then you get to their life story, Oh, they came from a broken family
M:	I don't have one.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, yeah, I think I know what you mean.
B:	So,  that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.
M:	I mean, I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm not that much of a car guy.
B:	Service charge you mean?
M:	And they're 2 0 against the NFC West.
B:	and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially or how does that work.
M:	Yes, I am.
B:	Yes, yes, yes.
M:	It's really only about a mile from Pennsylvania, I think.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm fading out
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh. You bet.
M:	we have a toilet, and a bathroom
B:	Wow. Boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	And there's no pollution.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't really care about my retirement, I'm just here for the money.
B:	Uh, no, I have not.
M:	We are you too
B:	So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.
M:	I am.
B:	It's more rural,
M:	Uhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Even if, if they're even in that long. Or they appeal, and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something.
M:	Not really. I just use it as a temporary storage.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I love skunks.
B:	Two hours where?
M:	Well, if you want to be an expert in the field, I'd say you're in the right place.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The world needs to stop being so unfair
B:	Oh.
M:	What is he doing in Dallas?
B:	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
M:	u know, stupid guys.
B:	Oh. Right. Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to. But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off. That's what I do. Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.
M:	
B:	You just get used to it.
M:	Beep beep beeps
B:	Oh, okay. Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball?
M:	I think it be like that.
B:	"Yeah, that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids, we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're JORDACHE new or whether they're *listen; ""because"" may start new utt unit  you know, something"
M:	I think that is...
B:	That's okay Um, I've, I've thought about that, too, and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here
M:	I was raised by a woman, and I know how
B:	And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.
M:	In Pennsylvania.
B:	Yeah. I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that I am, I do computer work and so I have a lot of those. So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them.
M:	It.
B:	But, I mean, that's going to tend to, I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit. The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
M:	But, we do have a program that does that.
B:	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
M:	Well, we've been considering Pennsylvania, and we think we're going to be okay.
B:	Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but, yes, we do. Both my husband and I work and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade. And the school years are wonderful, they're just wonderful.
M:	A lot of them.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Chili.
M:	Huehuehuhueh... that's how I've
B:	And, uh, we made that decision and, uh, so after she had the first baby, she stayed home. And, and we had a second baby and she's still at home
M:	He was a very nice man.
B:	Yeah
M:	Because it's a loan and you can borrow money from people to build houses.
