B:	it was just strange.
M:	You must be from the east coast
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He was really a big guy
B:	Is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?
M:	Yes, uh?
B:	I'm I'm with the N R A myself.
M:	we have a principal that has a gun and he shoots people
B:	Some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff
M:	I don't know, but I can tell you that they're all over the place in the ghetto.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can't just do that.
B:	Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley?
M:	Yeah, it's nice
B:	It should be, I think, a flat percentage and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.
M:	
B:	yeah, we used to, that's one of the, um, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
M:	that's, uh, kinda how it's supposed to be.
B:	Well, it really isn't too big yet. We, we a lot of people say that but, um, it's,
M:	I like them.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	'.
B:	There's should be, you know, this, for this crime, this is the penalty. You killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever.
M:	'
B:	Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it.
M:	It's a bit of a dilemma.
B:	Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science
M:	Uhhh, uh, I think they're having a great time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, you have to admit that they have some freedom of information.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	No, it's, you, that, you're.
B:	So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
M:	And it's
B:	Yeah, and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
M:	It's not.
B:	Oh, yes. Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
M:	I think you.
B:	Yeah, that's too bad.
M:	It's not my favorite, but I'm pretty sure it's my favorite.
B:	How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
M:	Uhhhhh... no
B:	Uh,
M:	Sorry about that.
B:	You know, but I wasn't, I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't have been there.
M:	Yeah, I mean, it's a real, uh, place.
B:	So,
M:	...
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not going to. I'm gonna dance.
B:	You know, I like what he says, and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
M:	you're... flexible?
B:	People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,
M:	I, too, enjoy it
B:	Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
M:	Ah, yeah, I'm gonna try it. I don't know what I'm doing right now, but...
B:	Four bedrooms?
M:	So what part of Texas are you from?
B:	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should.
M:	I'd rather not have my way out of it.
B:	just, pick up and head on out.
M:	Yes, we do.
B:	Oh, gosh.
M:	
B:	The one that was in for the seventeen years, actually served seven, and he's out.
M:	
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
M:	I'm a librarian, so I can do whatever I want.
B:	Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
M:	Uh, well, uh, I don't know a jury, you know, because, uh...
B:	Oh really.
M:	She's a dog, not a retriever.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, yeah. What do you mean?
B:	Yes it is. It's a tough, tough question. It really is. I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that. Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
M:	I think I read it
B:	I wish I could do something like that, but I can't, so
M:	What do you mean, you know?
B:	Yeah.
M:	They do.
B:	Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
M:	Yeah, I'd say so.
B:	We just had a bunch of people over and we had, we did lasagna and garlic bread and, uh, yummy.
M:	Ah, so you have to pay more than the cost of the job?
B:	Yes, uh-huh. I mean you can't help but love her. She's, she's the oldest one and, but, uh, very possessive.
M:	They had nothing stolen from us
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
M:	Are they still in the bins?
B:	They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it.
M:	Well, that's a little odd.
B:	Uh, we probably were listening to C N N fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began. Uh, we almost live and, and breathed it for, because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done.
M:	He's not a cook.
B:	Yeah. And, uh, if I couldn't have my luxury Maxima then I'd buy me a fancy little red C R X sports car
M:	Well, we are not in Pennsylvania.
B:	There probably are, you know, for but I'm sure, that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know, and I'm not saying just give them money but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be,
M:	yes.
B:	A health food?
