B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah I don't know.
B:	Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
M:	Why are you putting all that garbage in the trash can?
B:	That's correct.
M:	He said the same thing to the French people in Paris.
B:	Yeah. Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?
M:	Yeah, they're called the Peace corps.
B:	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
M:	So.You're saying that it's not a big deal?
B:	Oh, exactly.
M:	How do you feel about a child support?
B:	Oh, yeah, there's just,
M:	Right. So, uh, why do you?
B:	Uh-huh
M:	So,
B:	So, it's, uh, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, but the taxes would be, you know, perhaps, maybe one-third uh, of,
M:	Haha, that's awesome.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	There's, uh, uh...
B:	Right.
M:	Did you know that's a thing?
B:	So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
M:	Exactly. It's not like they're the only ones who can do it.
B:	Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is.
M:	We arent even going to get to that.
B:	Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car, so we have the advantage of being able to, uh, read and drive although there seems to be, from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
M:	You can be a medic if you have a heart attack.
B:	Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
M:	Are you in the US?
B:	Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.
M:	
B:	Yeah.
M:	
B:	so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.
M:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
B:	Philadelphia?
M:	you,?.yeah,' bout..??,What,manship,manship
B:	Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
M:	I, uh, I'm not a nurse, I just do, uh... I don'know, uh.
B:	Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
M:	Ugh, what about that?
B:	Yeah, and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh, and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.
M:	I like dogs.They are cute.They have a lot of personality.They don't have a place in the house.That is why they are dogs.
B:	Uh, well, uh, yeah. We 've spend a spend a did spend a lot of time, uh, it really helped when the, uh, older one was old enough to get his license and could, uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems.
M:	So is that the death sentence?
B:	that's fantastic.  Yeah
M:	... what?
B:	Uh.
M:	Well, I'm in Galvesto.
B:	and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country, you don't have to worry about any of that
M:	Yeah,
B:	That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, uh, Alsatian that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.
M:	Right, so, it's important to me.
B:	but.
M:	Like a... father?
B:	That's great. But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think they should have to do a year
M:	Yeah, uh, uh.
B:	My community, that's cute. I live in a place called Dye Mound.
M:	I'm not even sure.
B:	Uh, Grapevine, do you know Grapevine?
M:	Well, that's the limit of the street, but it's not really the limit, I'm pretty sure.
B:	With all the yard work and things like that.
M:	I don't know. I think I'm the only one that thinks they are the best.
B:	That throws the budget out of whack real fast.
M:	I'm not too sure.
B:	Yeah, see, that's the same thing here.
M:	Goodbye.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I, uh, don't know.
B:	yes, I do.
M:	I think we have that
B:	Elementary school.
M:	Yeah. I mean, I could build a home.
B:	Okay.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	We'll be on the other side of the river.
B:	It's a long skinny one and,
M:	The dog is in the background.
B:	Uh-huh. Ooh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	... but the men's bathroom?
B:	Oh.
M:	uhh.uh.uh
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	I'm a dog.
B:	Well, we're geared to that. We're like, okay, like I want a living room set. And instead of sitting back and, and going, okay, well, it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars, two thousand dollars and I'll save for two years,
M:	we,
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
M:	I'm not sure about
B:	Oh.
M:	I'd like the oasis
B:	and I find that I can often, you know, often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work
M:	What about the cat?
B:	I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
M:	I'm the kid's home.
B:	Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.
M:	I agree.
B:	Well, the times were different too.
M:	What's your job?
B:	Bye.
M:	Uhh... that's weird.
B:	At least in California, they're supposed to be. Not during the trial, during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background.
M:	Yes, I have.
B:	Yeah, yeah, well I, I went to Dallas, uh, when I worked for T I in Abilene and, uh, I'm a little familiar with the city area, Forest Lane and, you know, through that, off, off the freeway.
M:	you have.
B:	Uh-huh. Right, and then the family home evening, too.
M:	You've been
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, see?
B:	Well, that's, uh, I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
M:	I
B:	We were there for ten days.
M:	The way I understand it is that they're going to get the same treatment as the inmates.
B:	and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States. It's, uh, it's okay. I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
M:	Like a computer?
B:	and I just, sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
M:	Oh, Chris Xero
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,
M:	i
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Don't, they don'you,'they do, '
B:	Bradford's north of us.
M:	You, uh, you're a genius.
B:	I love classical music, and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the, all the characteristics of the instruments.
M:	I'm a guy
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yes.
B:	Hello?
M:	...
B:	Yeah, but you really need to see that movie. I, I we bought the movie and I I don't know how many times I've seen it.
M:	I don't?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think I heard it was three dollars and they just wanted to get it for free.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I know, uh, I know
B:	So he hasn't really gotten into, um, that yet. They have choir that they go to, you know, music class that they go to
M:	Oh, I think we need to overthrow them to overthrow, overthrow the way.
B:	Yeah, so, uh,
M:	
B:	Oh, yeah. Put them in salad, yeah.
M:	I went to a high school in Richardson
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But it's still not the same as a recycling center.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm so sorry
B:	Um, actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.
M:	I have a small group of my friends, but we're in China.
B:	It would really, um, and I don't the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend
M:	Uhhh...
B:	Yeah, I'm in Texas. Where are you at?
M:	...
B:	I know, we wondered about that. But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.
M:	Isn't there a death penalty in the US?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I've seen it.
B:	And over half of it has been drug related.
M:	It was
B:	How did you, what did you do,
M:	... are you okay?
B:	Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
M:	No, it's a Lancer.
B:	Okay.
M:	Ugh, I know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	How much money?
B:	Yep.
M:	You know, you just say, uh, it's cool, I'm not like that, you know?
B:	And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
M:	You know him?
B:	I, I, I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
