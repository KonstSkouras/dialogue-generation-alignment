B:	It seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
M:	Well, you can't, I'll, I'm.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ya, it is.
B:	You can't get away from it so I think, To some point,
M:	It's good

M:	I love how he was like Ohh ohh ohhhh ohh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm a bit confused
B:	Even the farmers.
M:	A
B:	and I, I don't think I'll do it again
M:	To be fair, I don't have a choice. I can get up at any time.
B:	Um.
M:	Oh. You're, uh, not, that's weird.
B:	Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
M:	They are. They have a lot of people teaching it.
B:	So that, that works out good.
M:	I've never tried them. I've only eaten them once. I'll try it next time.
B:	Oh, I .
M:	The youngest one is the oldest one.
B:	Well, it sounds like a good buy.
M:	I know what you're saying.
B:	But, um, they're kind of old older
M:	
B:	You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
M:	... so, uh, business?
B:	It's, it's amazing, they either have one or none.
M:	
B:	and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.
M:	You're, and
B:	Exactly, yeah, um,
M:	I guess you can't.
B:	Yeah. And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much
M:	You.
B:	Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up.
M:	You can't have a flag and a freedom.
B:	Yeah.  But,
M:	
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
M:	I'd love to see a picture of a glass window.
B:	Right, I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked.
M:	That's why they have the Cabbage patch, and you can see the cabbages.
B:	Really.
M:	The, uh, you know, night program?
B:	Uh, uh-huh.
M:	It was nice to be home again.
B:	There is a woman that, uh, made, well, she called herself a craft person so, I'm not quite sure what she made. And, uh, she made it. I mean there is no, your occupation has nothing to do with it.

B:	Oh yeah, that's great, too. Uh-huh. Yeah, we did some remodeling when we bought a house, we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering, that's fun.
M:	Oh, I see. So, if you don't mind me asking, what
B:	Uh-huh. Well that's,
M:	The cold cold cold part.
B:	Well, good.
M:	So, I, like, you, and, me, you
B:	Like you take Asian countries, or, uh, the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground,
M:	That's all of the good stuff
B:	Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
M:	It.
B:	Some baby-sitting groups, again, I know it sounds like a rationalization, but I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they, they learn to share.

M:	I can't think of a more iconic name than Jerry.
