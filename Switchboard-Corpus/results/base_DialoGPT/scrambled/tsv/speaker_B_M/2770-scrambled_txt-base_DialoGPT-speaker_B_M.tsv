M:	u bealphem, the girl plays the piano.
B:	Then I think it makes a big difference.
M:	Yeah. But I'm not sure.
B:	But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
M:	Well, I don't know.
B:	They never go to see them.
M:	You don't.
B:	Were you up in, in Wisconsin or would you go into where would you camp ?
M:	I mean, the whole system is broken. That's why they're doing it.
