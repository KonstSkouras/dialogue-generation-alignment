B:	Yeah. I think I think Texas is Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty, and I think, I know California had it for a long time, and then they, uh, took it off the books, they repealed it
M:	I'm not sure if I can do that.
B:	Bye-bye.
M:	So you wanna go with that?
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
M:	It's the police officer.
B:	So I, I, I, you know, it is a problem. And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford. When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.
M:	What?
B:	But, you know, our, like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not

M:	Oh. Well, I'll see you then.
B:	and I just, you get so attached to them.
M:	I'm, it's, and
B:	Good. There's nothing wrong with that. Actually I think probably if I were going to get if I were going to be practical, which doesn't mean I would be,  I would prefer white. Because, simply because it's more visible at night.
M:	I'm still waiting for them to get out of the hole.
B:	Right.
M:	Yea. I know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm going?
B:	Right.
M:	Oh, uh, uh.
B:	Where do you live?
M:	No, he had trouble with the river.
B:	Did you kill the deer?
M:	you.
B:	Um, you look at your paycheck and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go Um, what kind of, what kind of, uh, well have you pay a lot of in have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?
M:	I saw that.
B:	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
M:	You're welcome, but I think you've covered my answer too well.
B:	Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list, cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know, I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh, I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book and, uh, uh,

B:	So,
M:	This
B:	Uh-huh.  Right.
M:	You, and.
B:	Oh, that makes a big difference.
M:	
B:	And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know. It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes
M:	'
B:	Well, I was just talking about any company. Uh,  let's just say a lumber manufacturing company
M:	What?
B:	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
M:	Would it
B:	Yeah, well, you know,
M:	They would be mad at you if you did.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Japanese Nissan?
B:	Well, so, so . So, your wife, does she work right now?
M:	I'll get you off
B:	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
M:

B:	Yeah.
M:	Ohhhh, yeah, uh, no.
B:	but it's not,
M:	That
B:	We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.
M:	She's not a teacher.
B:	And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
M:	
B:	Are you serious?
M:	Florida? What?
B:	Yeah if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
M:	He nods. Yeah.
B:	Gosh.
M:	I think we should just do a tax on income.
B:	Uh-huh.
