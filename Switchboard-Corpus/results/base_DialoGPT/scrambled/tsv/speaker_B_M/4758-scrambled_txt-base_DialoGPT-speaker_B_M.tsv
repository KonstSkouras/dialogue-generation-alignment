B:	Oh, on one hand I see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
M:	Oh, you have money
B:	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else, and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
M:	They don't really.
B:	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
M:	No.No.no.no
B:	but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
M:	What breed is your dog?
B:	Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
M:	You know, I'm not too sure about this place.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The plants.
B:	Right.
M:	Yes.Yes.And if they dont know, they are just as bad as me.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M:	We do, but we don't have a roof.
B:	Because I, since I came from, my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters. So I both of my parents had big families, and we always we always got together, just always. Now it's different because I live here and I, you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can but it's real different.
M:	Hahaha! I'll be there all week
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, and?
B:	we're just so much wealthier, and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,

B:	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
M:	Yes, they do.
B:	Don't you want to be close to me? I mean, you know  be with other people.
M:	Uhh, I've never been there.
B:	I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person
M:	How do you know this?
B:	Right. That's right.
M:	I.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sure I can find some
B:	But,
