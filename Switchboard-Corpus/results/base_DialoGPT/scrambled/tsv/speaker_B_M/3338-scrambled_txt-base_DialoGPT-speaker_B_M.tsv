M:	i.
B:	You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
M:	Ahhuh??
B:	Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government, I don't know
M:	I know. But they taste good.
B:	You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, from what I've heard,
M:	I'm gonna go with a yes.
B:	Yes, I understand that, but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
M:	Uh oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I like to eat at the most, and eat a lot of food.
B:	Oh
M:	So, what are the kids?
B:	and I, I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas, and it wasn't that way when I was younger.
M:	Yup. You are all in America, though.

M:	That's funny, we never ever cheer against the Broncos.
B:	And then it just frosts me terribly.
M:	I think the best part is the
B:	But, uh, that was absurd  There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
M:	Well, I'm not sure. I don'know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I did, and he still owes me.
B:	And stuff like that. And so, um,
M:	I don't, she doesn't want to.
B:	Yes, uh-huh. That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas. Before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.
M:	Right. I'm. sorry
B:	Oh, that's not unusual, yeah.
M:	She nods.
B:	I don't know how much, and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate. She would, you know, crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working, and things like that. Yeah, much more than you would think.
M:	I don't,
B:	I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
M:	We got a bunch of airshows.
B:	At least they're coming around.
M:	She says that in her voice.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, it's not expensive.
B:	you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
M:	You are you not in the school, you know?
B:	Little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it .
M:	That's what I said.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm
B:	and I used to know as a Boy Scout but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.
M:	Yea, I know.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.
M:	Not exactly. I've never cooked it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think it is. It's a fact.
B:	Right.
M:	I'm sorry
B:	Oh, I see. So, do you ...
M:	You are the reason that I can't be the only one that thinks that.
B:	Right. Well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.
M:	uh, what?
B:	Yeah, uh-huh.
M:	
B:	and, I think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
M:	It's a fish, not a
B:	Yeah, just a little bit
M:	I'm sorry, but I think we're all out of ideas here.
B:	it's not step for step.
M:	So, you're
B:	Yeah, right, uh-huh.
M:	I think it's just her.
B:	They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy,
M:	That sounds funny.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, but what do you do when you're in a hospital?
B:	we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids.
M:	Well, you know, that's not how the world works.
B:	What's that?
M:	Oh. You did?
B:	and we all know one another and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.
M:	No, that's the same thing.
