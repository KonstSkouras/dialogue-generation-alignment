B:	Yeah. I'll bet they're involved. Yeah.
M:	Uhh, uh, I work in Georgia Tech.
B:	Yeah, it really does.
M:	I'm pretty sure they have, but I don t know.
B:	Oh. Well
M:	
B:	What's that?
M:	You have a cat?
B:	Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school. I, uh, I am a graduate student so, I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I wear too much of the time. Which is nice.
M:	No, you're thinking of the wrong person.
B:	But that,
M:	You can't really get it if you have no fast food
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	That's not how the study is supposed to be done.
B:	Bye, bye.
M:	I would not go to prison for a year.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	
B:	that should be life, but, instead, in, in given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know, and less they're out.
M:	I'm just trying to keep you from getting your hopes up
B:	And a lot of them decide just not to have children.
M:	I'm not.
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
M:	I'm
B:	I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for, for people to face.
M:	Oh, and I?
B:	No, I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.
M:	Uhh... um... I mean, uh, I think we're gonna need some of that.
B:	Ooh.
M:	How, are.
B:	Okay, sure,
M:	Yeah. I got it from a consumer.
B:	Right.  Well, I put,
M:	Well
B:	You're supposed to what.
M:	I know, I'm just saying it's not true
B:	Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever.
M:	Texas. You?
B:	Oh sure.
M:	I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but it's a terrible idea.
B:	Uh-huh. Right, uh, yeah, we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull.
M:	Yeah, uh, what's up?
B:	That's awful
M:	She nods.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We have some pretty good cucumbers.
B:	You're in New York?
M:	I think you mean... I don't know.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, I, I tend to agree with you. I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.
M:	The house is in Baltimore.
B:	And so yeah, it's, uh, wouldn't have, I mean, oh, if something happens to her.
M:	You're not the only one
B:	Uh-huh. Sometimes we'll have, uh, we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, uh, chemical services to come, out and spray for weeds, and fertilize, and all that and take that one step out of .
M:	What?! I'm not getting it.
B:	No, I don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up and I'm not that familiar with them to know,
M:	But, but
B:	I always, take home baked bread.
M:	And there was no language problem.
B:	We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.
