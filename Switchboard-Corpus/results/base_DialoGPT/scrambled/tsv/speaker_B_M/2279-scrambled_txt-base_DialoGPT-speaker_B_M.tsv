B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know, right?
B:	I mean, I, I used to enjoy going, I mean I still do kind of enjoy it, but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that I really, really enjoy seeing.
M:	So, I'm assuming that you don't know about the middle east crisis?
B:	Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.
M:	So, do you think that's a good idea?
B:	And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	My attic is a lot smaller than my house.
B:	Right.
M:	Ohhhh, okay, I'm a big fan of the egg.
B:	It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work. My mother's a school teacher and when, when we started, uh, having kids, she had to work for a little while, but then she just started substituting.
M:	Heh, I see
B:	It's probably happened to millions of people,
M:	That's what I said.
B:	We when I was, when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.
M:	I'm back.
B:	There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.  I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.
M:	Well, it's not really a nuclear weapon, so there's that.
B:	And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
M:	...
B:	Yeah.
M:	I
B:	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	Yeah, I'm going to the police
B:	Me, too.
M:	... Uh huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is one of the ugliest, most bizarre, most confusing, most nonsensical, most ridiculous, most annoying, most disturbing, most incomprehensible, most hilarious, most
B:	they don't get out of the house, they don't socialize but it's my home and I don't want to leave it.
M:	What is?
B:	but, uh,  sometimes I,  I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space you know.
M:	We're on the ground floor of a major hospital in the UK
B:	Really?
M:	You
B:	and it is, I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. It might be, I would say it's probably midsized for the area. There are some smaller, and there are, you know, several larger.
M:	I'm sorry
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's the thing?
B:	Huh. Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.
M:	How do they do that?
B:	It, it, it's pretty bad here, too.
M:	uuhh, uh
B:	Right. Well, that's good. Um, how many children do you have?
M:	It's really, really neat.I know of people who would buy it.
B:	Uh, cause that makes a big difference. My wife works part-time.
M:	That's not.
B:	Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and I was like, I'm not eating in there Are you nuts? And, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	I'm, uh, good.
B:	Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell. He, he's living now up, uh, in, in Maryland but, uh, he, lived in Grapevine for a long time.
M:	Is it just me or is the second story on the left a bit high?
B:	Well I'm not talking about any loss. I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. But it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their,  negligence.   For gross wanton negligence in a claim.
M:	I see.
B:	I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
M:	He's a part of the New York Rangers
B:	And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.
M:	I have no idea what you mean by that.
B:	I think it's great. I love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else, and competition. I'm going oh, great, you know, it's a, it's a great role model for everybody.
M:	Uh, yes.
B:	Have a good,
M:	You're, and it's
B:	No, we are west.
M:	I mean, you can just say that.
B:	Are you Mormons?
M:	You're dog?
B:	I, I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
M:	That's a big yellow'a '.
B:	Quicker  maybe, yeah.
M:	They should be.
B:	Well, but it, then they can have them play against each other.
M:	They have a dog and a cat.
B:	But, uh, well I got my thirty day notice yesterday.
M:	What are your fathers'fathers?
B:	but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
M:	Uhhhhh, uh
B:	Huh. I see. I know this isn't on our topic, but where did you grow up in California?
M:	So is it realistic to have Porsche Porsche racing on a racing simulator?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm just kidding
B:	And the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good, but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.
M:	I think I know you.
B:	Oh, gee, I heard Aspen got three feet.
M:	Well, he was a man of many talents.
B:	So what about yours?
M:	I'm pretty sure the farmer was a female.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then part of it's lack of education. I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
M:	I, I, I like plants.
B:	Well, when she got home, who took care of her?
M:	It's a book, so...
B:	Yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
M:	He's a good boy
B:	Right .
M:	It was pretty good.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you too, good luck and don't spend any money this weekend
M:	That's not true.
B:	Bye.
M:	I'm from the East Coast.
B:	Um, yeah.
M:	I don't know what you
B:	So.
M:	The garage is for work.
B:	That's what the Utah and the large family.
M:	well, we are the best team in the league.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh.
M:	And we're all French, so we
B:	Were any of them twins?
M:	
B:	I've skied in Colorado and we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper, you know.
M:	Well, they do it all the time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Well, thank you.
M:	Yeah.
B:	They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
M:	Oh, I agree. But it's a good
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They're all amazing.
B:	No. The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.
M:	Yeah. It's like he's gonna be back.
B:	Uh, usually either black or red.
M:	We do, you,

B:	Yeah. I'm anxious some day to have one here.

M:	Well, that's not what I meant.
