B|Right, Right. Uh-huh.
M|This is a lot more than just the dirt, this is the entire planet.
B|I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
M|The people I know are from Dallas, Texas, and I'm not from Dallas.
B|Of course.
M|Not at all.
B|Oh, that's great.
M|It would be a lot more efficient.
B|Okay.
M|That's what I said
B|Uh-huh.
M|Uhm, and, and you've been?
B|It really does, and, and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about, uh, much more crime than ever before. Drugs of course, uh, a big part of it I think.
M|I'm sorry, what?
B|it's a hard question, you look at the United States, we have the largest murder rate of any developed, uh,
M|Is this upstate New york?
B|Right.
M|I used a lot of brown rice, but I did use brown rice.
B|So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
M|That's a lot, I mean, it's a LOT.
B|Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered
M|Uhh, uh, uh... yeah, uh.
B|Uh, and we take the, the, uh, civil liberties, uh, stuff too far.
M|Because it's not fair
B|Uh-huh.
M|This
B|And so,
M|Because it is possible
B|but there are others in the family who do them better.
M|we could, we have, you know, children and money
B|I mean, they,
M|... because, uh, uh.
B|and I was disappointed when I went to Texas. I didn't see that many of them.
M|The appeal
B|Uh-huh.
M|Do you have a good job?
B|They're seen as senile
M|Well, they are.
B|Did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of,
M|I was,
B|So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
M|Heh, the guy in the video said that he broke in.
B|So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty So,
M|Red
B|And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
M|
B|I don't know  Yeah I think it was .
M|Umm. I think I'd be okay with that.
B|Yeah.
M|He got away with it, he had a good run.
B|you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on, and, uh, it's, it's interesting.
M|I'ma
B|Did you see that, where he, the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
M|I mean, you are a beautiful woman, and your dress is so pretty...
B|Uh-huh.
M|She smiles back.
B|Yeah. I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.
M|I think it's
B|Oh.
M|No. It's not really a problem.
B|when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house
M|
B|And I don't like that
M|You know, you're right.
B|and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
M|Yup. They are there.
B|They plead insanity
M|The seeds go in the tomatoes
B|Himself and her?
M|I'm... schl'er, sch... er... schm, I mean... schoo'er...
B|Oh, I'm not surprised.
M|I have a new car. I don't have a car.
B|but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, uh, see any results of it the next day.
M|It's the recycling thing
B|Um.
M|Oh yeah?
B|I'm not sure.
M|Oh I'm sorry, I'm not sure.
B|Yeah, I've, I've heard of that.
M|I like it, but I'm not sure why.
B|I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.
M|...
B|And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
M|I was just wondering
B|No, they don't.
M|What does a college
B|Huh.
M|I
B|So, five bedrooms and two living, two family
M|How do you?
B|instead of being, watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. Uh, and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war, I guess about two and a half or three weeks in, we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would, uh, watch, uh, fifteen minutes before, fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news, or our local news. We would watch C N N until six thirty, then we would watch, uh, a rotating network news of either, uh, A B C, C B S, or N B C and we, we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.
M|I don't think it's so much a punishment as it is a process of execution.
B|Do do you put it in the refrigerator then or
M|Yeah, and, we never throw a football, but we throw.
B|And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
M|Where do you live?
B|Uh-huh. Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.
M|I know.
B|So, it was real nice.
M|What?
B|and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,
M|That sounds great!
B|Right.
M|So.
B|Uh-huh.
M|They do it all the time. I don't think they're afraid of the consequences.
B|My husband got his big garage. He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
M|Right.
B|Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.
M|So the reason you don't want to be there is because of the cart?
B|Right. I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know.
M|But... you know... things like that.
B|You know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, uh, rollers or anything. It seems like a really good answer to portable music, that you can choose.
M|I'm not so worried
B|Um, that's possible I guess.
