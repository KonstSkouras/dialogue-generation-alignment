B|Uh-huh.
M|So.the.it.all.so.fine.it.
B|I think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with, with that. I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old.
M|It's not too bad.But I've had to put my laptop in the hot tub to keep it warm.
B|Uh-huh.
M|A small business company, if you will.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I think it is just, uh
B|Yeah.
M|Well, the kids in the UK are all working.
B|and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain, or, it seems they thrive when it rains, they just, really,
M|Are you Saint Claude?
B|Well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia
M|I think it's good
B|What, what are you doing?
M|No. Right.
B|But they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
M|I'm gonna say it's not.
B|It's a farm community, and we.
M|I don't know what you're talking about.
B|Yeah. Definitely I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
M|pox. anyways
B|I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but,
M|So they get the same treatment as the rest of us?
B|Oh, goodness. You get so attached to them.
M|That's good.
B|Uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.
M|I mean... You do have the peace corps though.
B|Yeah,  yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, what I'll do is, you know, like, I mean, you might have problems, but it's not your kids' problems you know,
M|You just need to drop into the nurse home, and you will find them.
B|Uh-huh.
M|He's a bit of a... cuddlebug.
B|So I do love classical music or it or, or, uh, contemporary classical.
M|
B|Bye-bye.
M|Because, you know, you're an important, important person.
B|They really do. I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more.
M|Why
B|Uh-huh.
M|Well I got out of the gym and ran a lot and I felt good.
B|Yeah.
M|I like to have a plan
B|you're not kidding. Do you ever watch AMERICAN GLADIATORS?
M|I love cats and I love my cats, but I can't have any.
B|Right.
M|They're, uh, sad.
B|Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.
M|I did. It was great.
B|Uh-huh.  Yeah.   Uh-huh.
M|Well, how do you pay for it?
B|Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything or are they just,
M|Did you learn that?
B|Yeah, you too, you too.
M|I do. It's not that bad.
B|Right. My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
M|...
B|right, we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. Or but naturally, no, it was even Mennonite related, I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
M|So you like it?
B|Uh-huh. Right.
M|So you have a church?
B|Oh, yeah, you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them, it's really kind of funny.
M|A lot of people have had the same issue with the same model.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I know that the jury decides.
B|therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
M|N?
B|Yeah.
M|We get the best of the best.
B|Oh, really.
M|I've heard of that too.
B|Yeah. Oh. Yeah, I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend, so.
M|I have, I, uhhhuhuhuh, we have, we, we
B|Okay, nice speaking to you.
M|Uhh, yeah, uh, that's what I said.
B|Okay. Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.
M|I guess.
B|Well that's the way it has gotten here.
M|And it's, uh, prison.
B|And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged,  you know.
M|I see
B|Uh-huh.
M|I mean, it's only her and she isn't.
B|yeah. So what's it been like up there?
M|i'm?
B|Right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
M|They're all back together now.
B|Uh-huh.
M|That?
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.  That's true.
M|It
B|Yeah.
M|It's not metal.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I don't think that's a small city.
B|I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered. I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen
M|I'm not
B|Well, yeah. Yeah, that's, uh, yeah, I think that's some of it. But, you know, I have, uh, I, I, it's just the way, you know, I think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.
M|That's because it's a good way to get your blood pressure up.
B|Right. Uh-huh Oh Now that's a big win.
M|I.
B|I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,
M|The, uh, foreground?
B|Oh no.
M|Uhhh... uh... how do you do that?
B|Thank you.
M|U
B|Uh-huh.
M|... guilty.
B|Yes. So would I.
M|Are you in the school?
B|Well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in the, the immediate, you know, Washington area.
M|You could, uh, not be interested.
B|Uh-huh.
M|you?
B|No, I don't. I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,
