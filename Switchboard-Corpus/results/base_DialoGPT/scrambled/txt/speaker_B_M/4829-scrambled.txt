M|Were you in the bears camp?
B|And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
M|Is that right?
B|Really?
M|I think you mean that.

M|Umm, no.
B|Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens. It was kind of fun.
