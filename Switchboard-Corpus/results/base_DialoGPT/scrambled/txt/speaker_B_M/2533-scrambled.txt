B|Right, and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,
M|Why is there no reason to do that?
B|And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
M|I know, I'm a girl, and yes, I went to Disney World.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|There's a lot of pollution down there
B|Um.
M|I think we're getting a frost this year.It's a little weird.
B|She's out,
M|He was in Richardson.
B|Yeah, this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time, you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.
M|What?
B|Uh, anything
M|I love it.
B|Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,
M|Oh, I've heard of it.
B|Yes, I understand.
M|The Vikings are going to the playoffs.
B|Right
M|They are.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|It is that, it.
B|And it's pretty cool.
M|?
B|Right.
M|What's that?
B|So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,
M|They are the best.
B|Yeah.
M|This is what I'm saying.
B|and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.
M|Did you know,
B|Oh, I see. Huh.
M|,They, shenan
B|And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.
M|I, uh,
B|Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged
M|Good morning
B|My husband is a physician, so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot. But children, I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.
M|Elway.
B|and I've been drug tested three times and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus. So see I, for some reason, I've come up three times. That's pretty high statistics.
M|I don't know.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Oh, well... I mean...
B|Uh-huh.
M|Okay, yeah.
B|Yeah, I, I, think, you know, I like dogs, but I think that, uh, I'm, kind of like big big dogs and you have to have room for them.
M|.
B|And, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but, There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.
M|Well, I came in from a dead family, so I'm not sure if that's how it works.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|
B|Uh-huh.
M|And, the, and
B|You know like people that are in prison, I mean we didn't put them there. They put themselves in that situation.
M|What is this soup?
B|Yeah, they're really wonderful.
M|You've never used it?
B|Uh-huh.
M|I'm not a cop.
B|Oh.
M|Why? Do they have to pay you for the time they put you through the website?
B|Right, exactly.
M|Can we just have a mandatory season?
B|Oh, catfish is wonderful.
M|I have to be home in time.It's not like they are going to miss me.But I'm sure they will.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I think we go to the same school.
B|Uh-huh.
M|But you?
B|Probably, yeah Yeah. But, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though, that, uh, that the people, though, that you, you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
M|Oh, and the, uh, the smo... Oh, well, they have the smoo...
B|Well another reason, well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. We have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,
M|I know.
B|We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.
M|Why are you gone
B|I, I think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. And there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing,
M|The last time I did that, it was for the second time
B|Oh that's terrible.
M|I don't know.
B|It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist. It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever
M|I don't know, I'm from the UK and I've never seen a single thing about it.
B|Pretty good trip. So what do you, what kind of hobbies are you in?
M|She has her own problems.
B|Because, uh, you know, that all depends, too, on where you are at. That's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. Because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less,
M|Uh, uh, uh.
B|Yeah. Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. So that's why we call her Liberty.
M|You could always just unload it and park it.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. Yeah, yeah.
M|Is that true?
B|Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
M|you mean unsweet?
B|Yeah.
M|I don't know about you but I've never seen a judge or jury that wasn't guilty of a crime.
B|It's always have to have it now.
M|Do you have a cat?
B|Yeah, same with drunk drivers.
M|Are you okay?
B|Yeah, that's how it works.
M|It's not that bad.
B|To try to make them more effective and useful.
M|I'm in Dallas.
B|You, too.
M|That's the most important thing, we love the language.
B|It starts with an E.
M|... and
B|Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
M|I don't think so.Right.It.Is.N
B|G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, well they actually have an electric minivan. Yeah. Their, their Caravan. But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars right now.
M|I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
B|And so, uh, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know, I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in. Most of them, uh, continue to work if they have, have kids.
M|Yeah, what?
B|You bet.
M|I like you.
B|I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.
M|I.
B|And everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
M|If you're not sure, you should be.
B|Well, if you,  enjoy it too, you know, you, you can get out in the morning when, before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to,
M|I guess it is.
B|So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.
M|Yeah. And there's a bunch of trees in Rochester.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I have a lot of family that lives in Minneapolis, so I'm not going to be able to rent a house.
B|I would have thought ,
M|How does one use a computer?
B|So they're professionals?
M|You mean people who are wronged.
