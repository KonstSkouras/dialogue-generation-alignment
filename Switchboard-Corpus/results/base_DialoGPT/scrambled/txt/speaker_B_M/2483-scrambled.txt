B|Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
M|It was a big problem in the 70s and 80s.
B|And that I, I've never been on a jury, I've never had that experience, I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
M|I'm not
B|Sort of easy listening because you like country but then,
M|I mean. Yeah.
B|My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that, and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser. I'll never forget that because I remember my brother, he came home and he counted the fish
M|Well, he was accused of it.
B|Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
M|I think it's the radio.
B|Kind of, uh, little guy in there. He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
M|You can cook it over rice, you just have to use the right broth
B|Um.
M|I'm sure you could get a good deal on it if you really wanted it.
B|Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
M|But what's the label on the label?
B|But it's just, it just was not and you get stung a time or two,
M|Uh, you're gonna need to pickle your own pickle.
B|Yeah, exactly. I like things that, you know, two people can do, but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know, kind of gives you some space for yourself, and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create, and I like to crochet and knit. I made some afghans and that kind of stuff. I like doing things with my hands.
M|I don't like the humidity
B|Italian food
M|Why do you think they have so many problems?
B|you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.
M|Uh, uh, uh?
B|Uh-huh
M|I have.
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's not a problem.
B|Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
M|I think.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Theylol
B|We're in Sherman.
M|A bit, I don't fight.
B|Oh, okay. Okay. Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
M|Yeah. They have a nice house.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Ohhh uh
B|Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
M|We should probably abandon the idea of being a family.
B|Uh-huh.
M|You are a terrible person.
B|Really?
M|I'm not a student.
B|I think I, think it would be fair.
M|We've been a lot of course, yea of, like, yeah, a lot.
B|No. Usually busy fighting for survival.
M|If they get a plea bargain then they can be charged with assault.
B|Have you, have you been active in, in politics trying to, concerning this? Have you like worked on political action committees or something like that?
M|
B|I just want to,
M|I think they're both guilty
B|And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
M|Uuhhh uhuh. Uhuhuhuh
B|Um, well, the, see, uh, well, we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
M|Oh.
B|No, I have not seen it. But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,
M|I can't
B|But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune. I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.
M|You're right.
B|You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.
M|What's wrong with that?
B|How many square feet do you have?
M|I'm in the industry.
B|Yeah.
M|It, it, it.
B|Uh-huh. Oh, yeah they're always in Florida. Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.
M|...
B|I sort of worked half time. I had very flexible hours. I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and I,  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers.
M|How much?
M|She.
