B|Well at least that would give a person a chance to look you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance
M|...
B|and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
M|uhuhuh. Uhuhuh uhuhuh
B|Right, yeah.
M|It's a car, not a car.
B|Uh-huh.
M|No, it's not.
B|and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
M|It's not like I had a chance to say that, it's just
B|Well, it's, uh, it's really both. I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, and, uh, and most of the time I enjoy it. Sometimes I don't, but I feel that, uh, that the discipline it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something.
M|I have a dog that likes to play fetch with me. He has a leash, so I've been doing it for about a year.
B|and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving

M|What do you're what
B|Yeah and,
M|Well I, uh, I don't know.
B|Oh, yeah. You bet you. You bet you. You know how they came up with the retriever, don't you, the Golden?
M|You can't just... you can't.
B|Right. Uh-huh.
M|Hmmm. Uh, I dunno.
B|public employees make great salaries around here
M|I don't know, I'm hoping we could get a third person to do it, but I'm not sure.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Uhhh. Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
M|He's the Chris, but his middle name isn't Chris.
B|Oh well that sounds like fun too
M|The question is, how?
B|Okay. Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously.
M|The only good thing about them is that they have the ability to be used in combat.
B|let them, do it.
M|u
B|Yeah. I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there, I have a lot of once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
M|Awwwwwwwww nursing homes.
B|You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.
M|Did you learn about the Utah Jazz?
B|And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.
M|New Mexico
B|Huh.
M|But then you have to have a watch that's on your wrist.
B|Oh, boy
M|
B|Right. Yeah, I'm not into watching sports. Now my husband likes to watch football, he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much, but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes to watch college on Saturday, and then of course Cowboys on Sunday.
M|There are no buildings.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Well they are the only two that have left
B|Yeah.
M|What did you do?
B|What about your home?
M|I'm a bit tired, but I'm going to do a little vacation in the beach.
B|But everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day-care and, and leave them and, I don't know, I just don't want, I just don't want strangers raising my children.
M|So what?
B|I'm building our house right now and I'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.
M|.
B|Two?
M|I don't have to be
B|Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
M|I am a father, you know.
B|That if the, the laws, and, and were, were harsher and were enforced,
M|How was the recycling process?
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
M|i,
B|Why?
M|He's, what?
B|Uh-huh.
M|I think you're confusing this with the car he bought.
B|Right.
M|So, uh, if you don't feel you could do that then...
