B|Well, that's true, and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,
M|I'mverysmart
B|Right.
M|You are a good man.
B|And it's like I said at our expense.
M|We don't.
B|Years, uh-huh.
M|' the,
B|It's a, it's a tough question. It really is. I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes. I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
M|What is?
B|Yeah, yeah. I think that it probably would be a, a good program. I think probably two years is too long.
M|I've been in a few, I have no idea what I'm doing.
B|Yeah, I tape it because I don't stay up that late to watch it,
M|You can.
B|Right, uh-huh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
M|We do know that the effects of it are very much different.
B|Uh, cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,
M|I was just joking
B|it, it was around there generally.
M|Yeah, it was.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary I'd, you know, I, Yeah, we, we do. We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.
M|I'm sure I could find something else to say about it
B|Uh-huh.
M|
B|Yeah, it's, it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs, at that point which could be one of, you know, many different night programs but it goes into night programs.
M|Because he did it.
B|And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship. And they lose their constitutional rights. You know,
M|And, uh, you know, recycling.
B|I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again.
M|It's the same as the B amp W, right?
B|and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.
M|Yeah, uh, uh.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Yeah, but it's been out for a while now.
B|And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
M|Yay! Another day of being
B|Oh, uh-huh.
M|I guess you're right.
B|How are they built?
M|Why?
B|and then she grew to be, you know, I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
M|Yeah, you?
B|I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
M|right.
B|and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
M|It's not really.
B|You think so?
M|I.
B|Well, good luck to you. I enjoyed it.
M|How many people do you know who don't have their own.
B|Yeah.
M|We do have a water system.
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's a pretty good city
B|Uh-huh. Um, I see.
M|Is it large?
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's just going for the sole purpose of the show.
B|Uh-huh. I know.
M|Uuhh. Uh, it's not like they are doing anything.
B|but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. It's like, you know, I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know
M|... and what about jazz?
B|But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated.
M|You know that.
B|but it's kind of, uh, all the industry has gone south,
M|Uhhh?
B|That's okay.
M|Oh. Yeah.
B|That's true if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket. Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.
M|Umm...
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|lol.
B|Yeah, yeah
M|I'm pretty sure the original was released in 2003, and the original version was released just a few months after.

M|And the state had to pay us to move to the state.
B|Tibby and Liberty.
M|... and we have a deal.
B|Uh-huh.
M|My brother.
B|That's one of my husband's pet peeves. He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
M|I'm a child care nurse.
B|Well, you know
M|u dogetipbot 10 doge verify
B|Uh-huh.
M|No. He said.
B|Once you think about it, huh. Uh-huh.
M|I'm sorry for your loss.
B|Um, like, like Europe,  um, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher.
M|and I was with him
B|Oh, really?
M|You know what I mean, eh?
B|Oh, that's great, uh-huh.
M|They're just playing the game.
B|Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
M|When did you first move to Texas?
B|we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the, the, uh, news magazine of the year for us.
M|That's good.
B|Yeah, that's true.
M|They were good
B|That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it
M|I know, I was just saying that.
B|He's got on I B M.
