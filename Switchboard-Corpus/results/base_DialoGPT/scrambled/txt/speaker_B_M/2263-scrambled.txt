B|Absolutely.
M|I wonder if they ever come back.
B|I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
M|:Yeah.adays.
B|And that was real nice. Uh,
M|Uhh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.Yes.
B|Oh, really?
M|Umm, yeah.
B|Uh-huh
M|Right, yeah
B|Yeah. So, that is pretty much for right now, that is, what I have been reading.
M|I mean, you can't be the judge of the jury.
B|Yeah.
M|I'm sorry.
B|Yeah. Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.
M|I love it.
B|so, that's not a good way to
M|It's nice here.It's a nice day.
B|That works, I'll go do that
M|Are you sure?
B|But not cats.
M|We have a lot of stuff in the US, so we can have a salad in
B|Uh-huh.
M|So, uh, what's the next step?
B|but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
M|I think
B|Uh-huh.
M|I told you, I was going to sell you a four eighty six.
B|Oh.
M|Are you referring to the damage?
B|Uh ...
M|I don't think you understand how the job market works.
B|Uh-huh. Right.
M|uh, uh, how did you get these?
B|Yep. Oh
M|I don't know
B|Uh-huh.
M|Nah.
B|And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh, I think the company still exists. What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know.
M|Uh huh, uh huh
B|and, and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
M|Wait, so they're the ones who
B|Yeah, that's right, you know he was one of ours, one of our boys.
M|Uh, you don't have to be so rude.
B|And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
M|I think that's just an old man saying that.
B|Well, in Florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year. It's constantly on the,
M|Food.
B|Well, I tell you, you know the, the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.
M|I'm a student, so uh, how?
B|uh-huh, a lot of women do. Um, I've just never really, you know, maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow, but, um, my husband takes it on, and I'll help rake up the grass, and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um, because, we don't have that much property, but we're on a corner lot, so there's a lot of edging to do
M|I'm
B|No, I haven't, I know that, uh, my sister, I have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.
M|It's the eastside.
B|and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful, they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.
M|I can't. I'm afraid.
B|But, they would have to be supported in some way, and I'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
M|What do you need?
B|We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
M|I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say.
B|Yes, it certainly does.
M|I don't
B|and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.
M|I know, I've been there for a while.
B|Oh, okay.
M|You're not a bad guy.
B|And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good and, and that's really what we've learned about it. She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
M|Does it have to go to trial?
B|Yeah.
M|Well, if you go through the rest of Europe you'll find a lot of them.
B|It's a whole new, Uh-huh.
M|I think that is the point of the experiment.
B|Uh-huh.
M|... but we do have capital penalty.
B|Uh-huh.
M|what?
B|to her Go talk to Daddy about it. Excuse me.
M|I'm not sure. Maybe it's just a year or two in the academy.
B|And
M|:
B|And it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,
M|I'm not sure.
B|Well, I mean, were there witnesses?
M|I know
B|Oh, uh-huh.   Yeah.
M|They're happening all the time.
B|Yeah.
M|A man's gotta do what a man's got to do.
B|My oldest is, uh, four and my youngest is about to turn three. Two girls. And they are a handful
M|The media is pretty much the only thing that can get him elected.
B|But wait
M|That's true.That's what I meant.
B|Is that right? Oh, neat,
M|Uhhh... what?
B|I'm a nurse and I work,
M|I'm sorry
B|uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh, it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have. I am sort of rereading it. It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle, but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian, he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know, he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,
M|That was the plan, yes.
B|so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
M|The Nineties.
B|Right. Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
M|You know, we have, uh, uh... the freedom to do, uh
B|I didn't know they did this.
M|How would you define it?
B|I mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides
M|Yeah. She's a good cook
