B|bye.
M|You're the book?
B|Uh, we had a, at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth. And, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, I would have liked to. I would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some T V watching.
M|Is it a middle name?
B|It was gorgeous. It was just gorgeous. I mean just gorgeous. Um, and they both, you know, both the half breed and the pure breed had the, uh, what I consider the, the, the perfect disposition. But you know what, you know what scares me about Golden Retrievers? Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders. Which is probably where yours came from. People that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic. And in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better. And when you start doing that you really tamper with, you know, the, all the, the years of, uh, culling litters and, and, uh, you tamper with what the dog innately is.
M|This
B|And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
M|But, what about paper?
B|and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.
M|He.
B|Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.
M|I do.
B|Yeah, I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh, I did some typing for my father when he had the company
M|
B|and it takes up your whole space
M|You were just standing on the side of the road.
B|And, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Now the interior, okay, I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.
M|Y
B|I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.
M|I have a. 22 in my living room.
B|You live in Pennsylvania?
M|And we used the same kind of paper towels
B|And, I mean, it sounds horrible. It, I hear myself saying this, and, but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,
M|
B|Uh-huh. Oh.
M|...
B|But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas
M|What, you know
B|Right. Right. I, I, it seems like they come in spurts.
M|I can remember my youth
B|I've, I've never I've never even been called to jury duty.
M|I'm from Pittsburgh, so I'm not too familiar with the area.
B|Right. And you know, if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean
M|I'm pretty sure New York Mets is New Jersey Mets.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|I know that. I mean it's just paper.
B|The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
M|I'm not sure about that.
B|Yeah.
M|We do.
B|Oh, yeah.
M|h,
B|Well, we have several children that are in sports, and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.
M|I love the dog.
B|Uh-huh.
M|What do you mean?
B|Uh-huh. I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
M|Why?
B|Oh, I do not remember the man's name, he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two, and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell, and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.
M|I think we've covered the subject.
B|Yeah, yeah.  That's,
M|What is important?
B|Yes, we do practice capital punishment, but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.
M|It's a small town.
B|It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
M|You don't need to be a skydiver to be in the military.
B|Fifty-five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five. And the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.
