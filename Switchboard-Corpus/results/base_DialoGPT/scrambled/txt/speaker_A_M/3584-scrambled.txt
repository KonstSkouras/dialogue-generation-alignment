A|Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
M|
A|My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
M|What
A|And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.
M|That, um, uh, uh?
A|Thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets. See, they, they sectioned it out even more. They used to just have like, uh, first of all it was all one price. And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. And now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one, just on the lower levels is the highest price, and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level, and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas, and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end, the direct end zones. But, um, they have about four or five different prices now, that they're structuring it with, but obviously yeah, they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do.
M|Well, you're not wrong.
A|Uh-huh, golly I know.
M|What? No.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I think I know what you're talking about.
A|They're kind of rare.
M|That's what I'm saying. I'm not going to consider that a loss
A|If you had to do something like that, day after day.
M|Uhhh... you are still out there.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it's a lot.
A|Yeah. I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
M|
A|and how, you're in,  Rome, New York,
M|Did you guys have any color in your leaves?
A|And, uh,
M|We have a bedroom, and a bath.
A|Yeah.
M|I'm so down for this.
A|Uh-huh.
M|The problem is that they're probably not trying it out in a home.
A|with, someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know. Is really kind of bad
M|I'm saying that the real people in the world would be able to see them all day.
A|And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
M|You can't really learn new skill when you are older, it's like you have to be really good at something.
A|But, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, I can just have anything I want. And I just don't see it like that. Of course, I always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover, that's what you have, but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that, but I can't stand owing. I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know, I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that. But, um, I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout. But, that's just the way I feel about it.
M|I'm in Texas.
A|Absolutely. They really go through it,
M|I can't,
A|Well, I have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons.
M|That's right.
A|and you're thinking, oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh
M|...what
A|Yeah.
M|There is that?
A|Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.
M|
A|Yeah, he's like, I thought he was the owner but it turns out my Mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about Neal Bush I think is his name.
M|You mean like, like, recycling?
A|He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
M|They're in the recycling bin.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I know, I'm sorry
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|Uh-huh.
M|That is the only thing that we really do.
A|Yeah.
M|not.
A|Yeah. Yeah. And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything, and oh, it was just awful. So, um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled. But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
M|I'm from Texas.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Weird. What's your point?
A|Products. Yes.
M|I can't
A|Wonderful.   Yes.
M|You are.
A|but certainly not,
M|I'm not sure if it's just me, but I've been paying a ton of taxes.
A|Yeah, the press has a lot of power.
M|It's not
A|Right. Right. And you usually get what you pay for. We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas, and they were like ten dollars, and we expected them to work nice for the little kids, and they didn't work worth anything
M|What is it?
A|so I'll tell them that and they won't, or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
M|I
A|But, I got to do more, more fun things.
M|Oh. Well... I guess you can't really argue that.
A|So, that's it that's okay, my, that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation,
M|No, I'm the only one that is, sorry
A|Ooh, that would be nice.
M|I feel like this dog
A|Uh-huh. Huh.
M|I spent as little as 5k on that, and I'm still in love.
A|It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was.
M|Where do you go to school?
A|Huh.
M|Wait... what?
A|Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
M|Yup. Uh, I think so
A|Than we think. Sure. Sure.
M|That'snot, I have problems
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure
M|I know, I was joking.
A|Yes, until you release it.
M|Well, it's a good thing I'm here, I'm just gonna be alone for a while
A|I, Well, yeah. So I am, and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
M|
A|um, I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
M|I did
M|Yes, I do.
