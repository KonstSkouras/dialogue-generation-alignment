M|I'm so
A|Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served? Uh, that's a good point.
M|
A|And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
M|It's a shame they don't see it that way.
A|Oh, well, that's not too bad,
M|I'm sorry
A|Well, not, not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for.  I'm an engineer.
M|That's
A|Wow, yeah.
M|You mean you are?
A|Oh, really?
M|You're a tool.
A|You know, so
M|And that's why I'm surprised they're hiring them.
A|I just don't know and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff.
M|I'm pretty sure you can.
A|Definitely seen it on, on, during the day down there , and I don't think it's a very violent show, I think it's funny. I think it's a real good concept, I think it's something completely new.
M|I stayed in Japan, it was like this
A|and they buried her alive
M|They are the best of friends.

A|I don't know that you do. If it's random, then it's random
M|Why is it illegal?
A|And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there, they love it. But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
M|...
A|I don't, I don't, I don't, I think that it should be, I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
M|What is glaucomas?
A|Yeah.
M|that coat
A|There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, you know, they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats. And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards. It was so funny.
M|It's not that I don't have any pride in my country, I just don't know how to feel about it.

A|That's what I hear.
M|the.my.the.water.
A|Well, don't they take people who have some sort of, um, big abilities like and, and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones I saw they had, um, a man on who was, uh, he played college football and almost went pro, and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the, uh, she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very, very big sports backgrounds. To have they, leaned away from that sort of,
M|Not really.
A|Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it away, and that's it,
M|Uhh, uh, uh.we're not in a basement
A|Yeah.
M|Why do you think so?
A|Yeah. What are you learning to be?
M|Uhhh
A|But what,  I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like
