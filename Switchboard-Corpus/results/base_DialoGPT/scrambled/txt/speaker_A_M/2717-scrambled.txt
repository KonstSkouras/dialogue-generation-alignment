A|That's very interesting.
M|You.
A|Yeah.
M|And the murder
A|Uh-huh. See, yeah, okay, well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind, okay, uh, we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
M|It's not.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I don't, but I'm right.
A|Yeah.
M|You were.
A|and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
M|... why?
A|Do you like to cook?
M|No, that's not what happened.
A|Because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're, you're dooming them to being underclass people.
M|I
A|it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything. But it's, um, it's really refreshing. So,
M|I
A|Oh, yeah.  It comes and goes.
M|It's not that. It's the wood burning.
A|Same idea
M|I got a snow peas last night.
A|Uh-huh. And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
M|
A|That's right.
M|Yeah, I'm sorry.
A|So I can see where that, that, may be a problem.
M|So uh, how did it go?
A|um, now I'm, actually I'm, I'm not working anymore. I'm a student, I'm a graduate student so I'm doing a lot of writing but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,
M|We can do a night's
A|What do you use it for?
M|Have you ever heard of the word, uh.
A|We've been real lucky. So,
M|What's the most common thing in the world?
A|they're all real young, they're just raised right that's what God's told them to do but they're not condemning you, if you, we only have one child, you know, they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do that, you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it. And so I'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't do that at all.
M|
A|it's just, you know, another killing.
M|It's a reference to the song'' Get out''
A|Uh-huh.
M|.of?
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|There are some places where it's not that expensive, and I live in Japan.
A|And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or,
M|Uuhuhuh. Uuhuhuuhuh
A|Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
M|No, she's not.
A|Yeah. Yeah, well, I am, I'm a big football fan. I never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it. And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.
M|I think it's a benefit of being a'long time'employee.
A|Uh, we have no basement I don't know,
M|We're
A|Yeah.
M|I like camping. I don't go to the campsite.
A|But they have, I read somewhere, and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States. Have you ever heard about that one?
M|Oh. Uh
A|Uh-huh. Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know.
M|But if they are from another country, they are still citizens of that country.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|You're
A|I'm building my own house.
M|We're the recycling center. We're the ones who make paper bags.
A|Yeah, I think so too. I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
M|I
A|My word isn't that sorry. That's sorry.
M|Uuhhh... what's that?
A|Oh! like a
M|
A|That was a dead giveaway, huh?
M|Well, it's not that bad.
A|and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
M|He's a cousin of Elijah.
A|uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
M|It's the most beautiful thing ever.
A|I've tried to do that with sugar
M|Are you going to make the joke about me?
A|and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty
M|Why do they fear having children?
A|I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
M|No...
A|Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
M|I think they'd be better off in the UK if they had to choose between the two.
A|Now we haven't watched any of those.
M|Just...
A|Uh-huh. I have a girl and a boy, and the boy's five, he's in kindergarten, and the girl is four. She'll be in kindergarten next year. Uh-huh.
M|you
