A|Yeah.
M|What??
A|Did you know that, No, really not. Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
M|I don't think he'd ever come home to me
A|Do you have a favorite instrument?
M|He she's good
A|You know it's,
M|And I think that's fair enough.
A|Just her whole house is like wow.
M|Oh, you know.
A|and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put, um, really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla, um, custard. Yeah,
M|I...
A|and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,
M|They practice capital, uh, murder, uh?
A|That'd probably be pretty interesting. I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. They had summonsed eight hundred people, about four hundred showed up, and it was for a murder trial.
M|I'm in the UK. We have an airbnb
A|Oh, oh, yeah, well, um, um, it may be that, um, it was recently replaced, by actually by, um, by what may be my favorite T V show of, because sort of, uh, um, TWIN PEAKS.
M|So, is there any way to change the color of the metal?
A|But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print
M|I know.
A|That's where the speed helps out.
M|So what do you think of the relationship between Rome and New York?
A|Uh-huh. That sounds like it'd be fun. Did you go alone or with a group or,
M|Oh, I know. It's a little... spicy.
A|Oh, yeah.
M|I, uh, I don't know.
A|Right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
M|That's a lot of money for a toy car.
A|Yeah. I wish we'd,
M|I mean, what state?
A|Oh. But,
M|I don't know, but I don't like to think of them as such.
A|It is, uh-huh.
M|I thought they were the best. I think we found them in the first year.
A|Ugh!
M|I have to ask... Why do you have a child?
A|Yeah, that's true.
M|I am.
A|We spent too much money,  until our children went to college, so. So, tell me about,
M|He said, and then, I.
A|I used to, when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
M|I mean you can't really do that with a spoon
A|Right, that's a good idea.
M|You are correct. They are not the same.
A|Uh, I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases. Course, I, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
M|... and what about how do you?
A|Uh-huh.
M|You have a point.They have no control over the press, they can't control the press.
A|I like it, uh, part of my problem is I have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
M|N '.
A|And, uh, where are you from?
M|I'm glad I have cats, I don't have any pets, I'm a cat person.
A|But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
M|It's a lot easier to say the world is flat when you're not even half way there.
A|And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals. I do that right now,
M|It
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yeah, we did, uh, we had, uh...
A|you know, stupid guys And, uh, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.
M|
A|And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe. It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
M|she?
A|and it's really a, a blast. My wife hates it, but that's the way life is, I guess.
M|How do you know that?
A|Um, I don't remember myself.
M|Well I wouldn t mind if they left the cat alone.
M|The best part is that my cats'names are the same.
