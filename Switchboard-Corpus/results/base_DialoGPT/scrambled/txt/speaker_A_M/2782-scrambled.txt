A|Well, it's very true.
M|Uh, um
A|Don't get enough sleep as it is, right
M|I'm Chris xeros.nuff said.
A|Yeah and how Yeah how it'll sway from one one extreme to another.
M|Yeah but I'm, you know, the one that's being made
A|yeah. Uh-huh.
M|If you don't mind, I'd like to know if we could put a website or something in the sidebar for people who do this?
A|Yes.
M|Well, they're just a big rock.
A|it's a rotation.
M|It's more close than I expected.
A|I see.
M|...
A|Good. Should we, uh, start this so we can,
M|Yes, and I am so happy I'm not dead.
A|See, I never, I, I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
M|It's a quote from the movie'The Prestige '.
A|Is that how you, I have never,
M|I don't know.
A|Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas, and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, and of course it was definitely there. So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. I don't know what the answer is. I know that it's scary, and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
M|We'd be better off if we had the money to buy the kids.
A|Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
M|...
A|Uh-huh.
M|Where
A|so.
M|Well, if you're a native American, you should probably be.
A|Yeah, it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.
M|You can see the lines on his back.
A|Yeah. It was a very interesting vacation. The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
M|But... they're not.
A|Yeah.
M|How long are you going?
A|I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
M|Well, it's nice to have some food, uh, and... food.
A|Go ahead.
M|What, you don't have a proper accent?
A|Yeah, right, right. Yeah, well I, I only, you know, subscribe to the things I'm interested in. I used to be into coin collecting so I used to get the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, you know. I used to get that. So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really, really want, you know.
M|
A|and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know. So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
M|Uhhh, what?
A|We have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
M|Metal, so metal.
A|How did they end up this year? Did they, did they make it to the play-offs at all?
M|It's not that bad. It's just that, you know, you're not the best at this.
A|um, it's really, I mean, and, and it's hard to sell the properties. People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
M|Uuhuh.
A|so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say.
M|Well, uh, I've been to Austin twice, and...
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm not going to say anything about it. I'm not gonna say anything.
A|And we just have this, uh, really good time there. One thing is they don't have mosquitoes and, uh, sorry to say,  and, uh, in Wisconsin we do, so, that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your, uh, you know, if, if you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs and, uh
M|I'm... I'm sorry.
A|Uh-huh. Yes, they are.
M|There are, uh, lots of things to be done down here.
A|but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these. I mean, it's just beautiful. It's like a custom, you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins. You know, I mean, it's modern it's,
M|how do we could'a, and, i,
A|Really.
M|I've got it all laid out now.
A|I know Florida has it.
M|But they're still the same.
A|And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
M|It's just a little bit of a pain.
A|Oh how funny, I can imagine. Yeah, I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death.
M|Not ahem
A|Yeah, I, I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
M|That's the first time I've seen it.
A|Well, it was good to talk to you.
M|You're assuming that.
A|And we've got grandchildren now, so when they come, they have to have a place.
M|... I... I just saw the second one...
A|That's even harder. But,
M|I know!
A|Yeah.
M|How old?
A|but it, this is her first credit card thing, well, when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal. Look at this they sent me this money, you know. So then when I explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff , of course, she tore it up.  But a lot of parents would not take the time, you know, and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and I are, and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it, they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something.  You know, somebody sent them something free.
M|you..
A|and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
M|Yeah, please, yes, and.
A|Well that's okay. I guess it's an easy thing to do. So you're you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?
M|But you could've done much, much better.
A|Well, they say, I think I, um, have read recently that, uh, the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps.
M|Uhh.
M|Not to be that guy, but it's a song
