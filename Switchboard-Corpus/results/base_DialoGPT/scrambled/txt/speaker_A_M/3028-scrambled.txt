A|Uh-huh.
M|It
A|Yeah, I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six. That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
M|Because, uh, that's the only thing that
A|Over a very long period of time.
M|I think they're in the mountains, but I could be
A|I like photography a lot,
M|I'd be nice,
A|And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, I, you know, I have interests that, too,
M|Uhhuh
A|Yes, it is.
M|That's.the.about.about.
A|Oh. Do you have brothers and sisters?
M|It's not the worst thing.
A|I mean, I'm not kidding you.
M|A retriever is a dog, not a dog.
A|You go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there. And I always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
M|That's a great deal.
A|Um.
M|You.the.what.
A|so we're considering Pennsylvania, and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
M|Do you?
A|Right. Yeah, my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,
M|And it's already been...
A|I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things. I don't know how I would feel about it. But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
M|No, I think it was six or seven.
A|You think about it and it's really, I don't know. This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.
M|I can't even get a hold of a cucumber.
A|We don't have, I guess too much trouble in Dallas with, well, I guess, I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico, that cause problems, but, uh.
M|You're not alone.
A|That's true. a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that. There, there is no well defined mechanism at all and, and that it is a a loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that. But it, but,
M|Well, it's a lot easier to get in prison than it is to get out.
A|Yeah.
M|You can't go back to work.
A|Uh-huh. I know it, I know it.
M|I know, right?
A|Yes
M|You know, I just have
A|And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. You start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.
M|Hahaha I can't do that.
A|These are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. You know, these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war. And, uh, they have, you know. So I, I, I do have a lot of sympathy for them, and I feel that America could try a little bit harder to, to help people adjusting to the American way. Because if they don't, you're just going to produce, you know, you're going to produce an underclass, you know. You're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks, being sort of led out of slavery and then, then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then. And there was no,  real up, upward movement.
M|He died in the second half of the first season.
A|I'll be darned.
M|Yeah, but we have snow.
A|They became a very successful immigrant group. But, and, but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam, right now, coming from worn torn countries, are, are not having the same success. I think some people have just assumed, well, why, why can't you be successful? The Japanese were, or the Chinese were, or something. And it's really much more complicated.
M|
A|You're, uh, everybody I speak to is in Texas, oh, oh, yeah, but I'm, I'm in New York and, uh, we seem, we seem to have, um, I think the AMERICAN GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well, sometimes.
M|It's because you don't have a cart.
A|right. Yeah.
M|Oh, yeah.
A|Uh-huh.   Yeah.
M|Hehe. I have a few of them.
A|Yeah.
M|You have to ask the question.
A|Well, that's pretty .
M|I know.
A|Well.
M|No.
A|Exactly,
M|What do you mean?
A|Yeah, are they, um, just house pets?
M|i
A|Yeah, the, uh, the B M W is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and, and then you go to Porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
M|What?! I'm just joking.
A|That's right. Everything we eat. Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it
M|Uhh, I've heard of those.
A|Okay.
M|I think it's a bit too far.
A|Oh, that's wonderful.
M|I'm sorry for your
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|Yeah.
M|We're just, not really, not a good relationship.
A|And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags. They won't take those. We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.
M|He, just, with.
A|It's cut back, you know, considerably, but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood, so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
M|I'm sorry.
A|It really was, yeah.
M|Yes she is.
A|Uh-huh. Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway. That's his, that's his,
M|I think they're saying it's not too late to get back to work.
A|What do you do?
M|It's just a good, fun,, game.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well those travel magazines, are that, more or less, show you different countries that you could go to or,
M|I.
A|Uh-huh.
M|sighs
A|Oh.
M|What's the significance of the Mets opening?
A|What type of job do you have?
M|Yeah, it's the school, not so, school.
A|and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around, I think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down. I don't know what channel he found that on
M|you, '
A|Yeah. Huh.
M|This dog is so cute!!!
A|Well, that's really, yeah that's, I bet that was nice.
M|It's random.
A|and, and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on.
M|You'll be fine.
A|Uh-huh.
M|You do?
A|I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.
M|You
A|Yeah.
M|Taxes.
A|So But.
M|
A|I like that.
M|I'm a man of many talents.
A|Uh-huh.

A|Right.
M|I don't know.
A|Sure. Let somebody get something out of it.
M|Yes, but that's not a problem.
A|I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
M|I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
A|and we caught, the individuals got caught, we, uh, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
M|The only one that I've ever met who can't be a dog owner is my dog.
