A|Pardon?
M|...
A|Oh.
M|I'm sure she does, she has it
A|Yeah, right. Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress
M|I think they did.
A|Yeah, that's true. Take them for walks, right. Yeah, I see all the people on, on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
M|Uhh, uh
A|And have a good afternoon.
M|What year?
A|It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
M|Baby siters are down at about six dollars an episode.

A|My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
M|I'm just glad he's not in jail.
A|I don't remember if I had shrimp.
M|I can't imagine why you would be so cold.
A|Oh, that's good.

A|Well, right now we're just renting, but it is a home. Um,
M|You're.
A|Yeah.
M|What?! What?
A|But, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, well, we got asparagus, and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
M|You can't be.
A|You know, and I'm, I'm thinking woman, wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.  But ...

A|Uh I think that uh you know I I just read something I think in TIME magazine uh about um protest

M|Hehehe.
A|But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
M|You wanna do something?
