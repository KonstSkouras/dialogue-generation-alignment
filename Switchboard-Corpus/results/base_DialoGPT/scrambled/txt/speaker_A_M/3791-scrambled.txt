M|We have a cat, I think we have a brother.
A|See them. Yeah. Yeah. It really is. Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon,

A|I have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
M|I know, right?
A|I know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets.

M|How do you know?
A|No. Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah. Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My accounting department will at the end of the month.

A|Yeah,  so the convenience,  Right.
M|But... Florida.
A|so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.

M|, I'm sorry.
A|Yes. The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,
M|And what we had to do.
A|So I'm, I, you know, I,
M|... because we're a state.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Right. It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality. Now it's we're protecting our lives. It's a it's a much different,

M|Oh? You've seen anything?
A|Yeah.
M|He's the one that runs the dog park.
