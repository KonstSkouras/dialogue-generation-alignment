A|Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands. I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh, and I needed air-conditioning and, uh, can't remember what my, oh, I wanted uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
M|So what's your point?

M|It's just a joke.It's not even funny.
A|Uh-huh. Well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
