M|It's
A|Right.
M|Well, I am a female.
A|Uh-huh.
M|... and
A|Uh-huh.
M|Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold, hold. Whoa.
A|So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long
M|
A|and their manager assumes they have a drug problem I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.
M|I'm
A|Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things

A|Is it in the phone book?
M|I'm guessing you're on the wrong website.
A|and I worked in a very rural school district and I, I, one of the things I taught was a computer class

A|bit. Tell me how yours works. Well, at the I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we are, uh, we're on the east coast now.

M|They do
A|but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.
M|And paper!
A|It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. The coastline was just incredible. It's huge.
M|Um, um, um.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment.
M|It's an attic
A|Right.
M|I don't think you understand the point of this post.
A|right, just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed

M|Yeah, I know.
A|Uh-huh.
M|This is so sad. I can't imagine
A|Oh, yeah, if you if you can, yeah.
M|The plants grow,
A|Oh, yeah.  Okay.
M|I love the idea of a car with a car.
A|You miss the whole thing.
M|
A|Sure. Yeah.
M|I'm sure there are many other countries that don't have this problem.
A|I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,
M|They've been in the NFL since the 70s
A|um, yeah , right in the, in the lukewarm milk. Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good. It seems to be better than putting the, the cornstarch into the liquid it, once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
M|So... yeah, it's fun
