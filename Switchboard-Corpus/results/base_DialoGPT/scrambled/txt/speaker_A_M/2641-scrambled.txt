A|Yeah.
M|I have a son. He's out.
A|Yeah, an, and my, my kids,
M|I
A|Okay. Yeah.
M|
A|Uh. Uh-huh.
M|what
A|Oh.
M|Well, I guess
A|But, if there are some people who don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
M|Hahaha. Nice.
A|and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really made me feel good.
M|you
A|Well, if you're looking for a nice, Uh-huh. Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
M|... and that's
A|Yeah, uh, uh, isn't that weird?
M|I dont know
A|And,
M|Uuh
A|Wow. Why is that? Do you know? I mean
M|I don't think we'll get any better.
A|they really do. Yeah.
M|I'm pretty sure they're just looking for a way to make money.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yeah, it's a bit of a problem, but I'm not going to be alone in the gym
A|And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
M|Uhm...
A|Oh, really.
M|no
A|Uh-huh.
M|That's a lot of money for a country that was so far away from being the most powerful nation in the world.
A|And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed. We do a lot of traveling around. We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
M|Just, it's so exciting
A|And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,
M|I can't even.
A|Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know, all cats are indoor cats,
M|I think it's a little bit more complicated than that.
A|Yeah. Right.
M|I
A|and that got to be somewhat expensive, so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount.
M|we
A|Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.
M|It
A|Right. Right. Uh-huh. Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.
M|Is it cold?
A|And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.
M|You should upgrade it.
A|Uh-huh.
M|What's wrong with that?
A|do you all, uh, have a budget?
M|No
A|Oh really.
M|?
A|Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
M|...
A|and it is too far south for me,
M|The most jarring thing about this is the and
A|Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all
M|I like you're doing it
A|Yes. Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting? Do you think that would be, acceptable?
M|You'd be hard pressed to find a, a, or a
A|Oh, that's great.
M|He was also the next generation.
A|Yeah.  Well, we had growing up I guess I can talk about us. We had nine kids in our family. We had eight boys and one girl. But, my Dad, uh,
M|Ohh.
A|Right.
M|Ugh, the parents of kids who are going to school tomorrow.
A|I'm glad my husband's not like that.
M|She's a lady, she can stay out of the way.
A|So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
M|Why is she so thin?
A|Yeah, we, we did, for a time.
M|
A|Um.
M|This.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Uhh, how close are we?
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's Sunday morning in New England.
A|Yeah.
M|How much do you guys have?
A|I bet
M|How is the cat getting so much food?
A|Oh yeah. That's a given.
M|
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Would, it would, It would be just futile.
M|It's not.
A|Just hadn't heard much about them lately.
M|Oh, yeah.
A|Okay. Thanks a lot, and you have a good day.
M|I'm so. so. uhh.
A|Yes. Yes. Not getting paroled, let's say in so many, years.
M|i think it's okay if you do it
A|Uh-huh.
M|Ah, well.
A|That's right. Uh-huh, yeah. I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really, really bad. I mean you,
M|Well,
A|Like what?
M|I know.
A|Uh, no but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money. If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.
M|It's just the state of being, isn't it?
A|and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.
M|Oh. Well, I have a room.
A|I, I get a little bit nervous about it, and, uh,
M|Cowboys? The only team that was ever really in contention for the NFC North?
A|No, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. We've only been married for five and a half years. And, uh, we have two small children, and he had a, uh, just got transferred here to E-Systems, so.
M|There is a house in the play room
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|Well, that's interesting.
M|What? You can't tell me what to do, I don't know what to say.
A|and I know she's eating the right things, and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her, so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
M|Yeah. It's a very slow process, but we can't really do anything without a lemon.
A|And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses
M|I guess you're right.
A|It's like a Macy's, kind of store,
M|Murdering
A|I'm sure that's fine.  I'm sure.  Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
M|Oh, cool.
A|We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.
M|So what you
A|But there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. that's about, five percent right there
M|I've been told by my family that I have an apple.
A|Uh-huh.
M|What about the jacket?
A|Uh, you know,
M|... uh... What?
A|Yeah.
M|I don't know.
A|It's, yeah, That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt? Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
M|They do.
A|Oh, sure.
M|
A|I've done a little, a lot of different kinds, but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great. And, uh, I'm, so I'm real spoiled.
M|Yeah. It's, uh, nice.
A|Yeah. It's like you said, you know, to each his own. And we're planning on having my wife stay home. And but,
M|This is why I always go to the toilet
A|Yeah, I heard that. It's, it's daughter, it's his daughter that,
M|Well, the owner is a lawyer.
A|Uh, I,
M|That is it.
A|Huh.
M|I have a base for my PC, I have a few extra keyboards I use.
A|Uh-huh.
M|We bought it, and it's the best thing we've ever done.
A|So he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching
M|Oh, okay. I'm gonna go and do that then.
M|I'm curious about the reason why it was done, like the people who had the money
