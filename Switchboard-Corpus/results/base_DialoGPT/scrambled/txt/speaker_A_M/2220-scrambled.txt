A|Oh no.
M|what
A|I think so, I think because people sort of get through, you know, um, I think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the, as well as, you know, some mental fitness and I think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.
M|Do you like the potato salad?
A|Which is rare.
M|You have a basement, it's not a problem.
A|No, they're, all of them are tested once every three
M|Yes.uh, um
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yup. I'm from there.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Heh, I see what you did there.
A|Uh, okay.
M|I'll have to check when I get home, but I think it'll be around three or five dollars.
A|Okay, so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,
M|Right, and
A|there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
M|It's not an orthodon. It's a pallet.
A|Uh, probably. Uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
M|I, uh, I think I'm gonna need to see some medical records.
A|I see.
M|I've had a cat.
A|Yeah, that's, that's right talk to, I had to talk about gun control with somebody and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day,  and was going target shooting, you know,
M|Do you like it?
A|Me to. Bye, bye.
M|We have a cat.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm talking about the American Kennels.
A|I kind of, uh, stopped listening after a while.
M|Does it
A|It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
M|
A|Oh, how funny.
M|...
A|and then when I would come home and he would leave, and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know, someone came home and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something. It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M|We're going to do this.
A|and, uh, really need a faster system. Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
M|You have a good point. I wonder what the other people are like.
A|Uh, that was about a year and a half ago, and,
M|
A|You feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
M|It's a bit over 2.5 million, so that's a pretty good deal.
A|Oh, my God.
M|I guess so.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I think they're volunteering for community
A|Right. Right, well I guess that's a good point, uh,
M|You know,
A|Yeah.
M|I have the receipt for the consumsers.
A|Yeah, but, you, you think that, I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
M|I don't know what you're talking about.
A|I had a friend in I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.
M|I could probably get a tv in the middle of a city.
A|And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, I think it's well worth it. I just demand that time for myself. Now I've learned to do that
M|Ohh.
A|Oh, out of  As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
M| helicoptering
A|She's, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
M|Because of the freedom of choices, I guess.
A|That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
M|He's not interested in the drums.
A|There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
M|Uhh, you like them?
A|Next thing you know, you've got him.
M|I hope you enjoyed your time here.
A|Problem, uh-huh
M|I know, I'm just telling you that's how it sounded.
A|Uh-huh.
M|... and a week?
A|Well, not really. It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
M|But it's still not a thing, right?
A|Oh really.
M|What is it?
A|Uh-huh.
M|I do this, I do this!
A|Bye.
M|You're a.
A|You know,   they could,  somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know, that's a good starting wage
M|No, not that. I don't think so.
A|And we got a few, you know, we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
M|That is the best thing about the car. When you're driving, you're always at a full stop.
A|On the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums, and we have morning glory
M|I just don't know how to tell the difference.
A|That's right. I'm, I'm kind of bad about that.
M|Yeah, but I think it's just the most likely scenario.
A|Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
M|Uhhh... I don't know...
A|Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats.
M|No.
A|Okay.
M|
A|Right, you know, if, if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist, we could find one it wouldn't be convenient,
M|It's awwwww
A|We, we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married
M|...
A|Oh, yeah.
M|I think they have, uh, some, uhm, winter produce coming from south America.
A|Oh, yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
M|Oh okay.
A|but, also most places, like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not but,
M|You know, I'm not sure.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Um, I have that on my, uh, computer here and also, um, I do some work at U T D and, uh, that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software. And, um, I don't know from my own experience, um, WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have. It may be improved by now but,
M|i know it's a joke, but it's still funny
A|See, I even know his name because he's on the news a lot, and I never had to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
M|
A|Oh, okay.
M|Nope, I don't.
A|That's a good idea. We ought to, Yeah, and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I don't know what they're going to do. It's really not my family. It's my fiancee's so I don't, I can't say much.
M|What do you mean?
A|we better have him do do something. You know, educationally.
M|I think it's possible, but it's not a good idea to be a medic and a caretaker.
A|You know.
M|Golden Retriever.
A|That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.
M|How are they?
A|Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
M|I'm serious.
M|...
