A|What about fast foods? Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
M|No, I'm not, you're not a real threat to me.
A|you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural
M|and so many times
A|I want to see your driver's I, I, I don't,
M|But we have no water
A|Snow peas are up and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.
M|It's been good
A|And, uh  you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.
M|The dog was never the same after the dog incident.
A|and I wish it were several months of that.
M|Yup, you're right
A|Yeah, they're going to get better. I mean, you know.
M|Polk, PA.
A|so, I think she'll adjust,
M|You think you know
A|Yeah, it is hard
M|You mean, like, you're driving a car?
A|Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing. And she does make a lot of sense.
M|Where in Pittsburgh?
A|I,
M|They are all up votes.
A|and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
M|The family, family, families.
A|Yeah.
M|It's not really.
A|Is it, that's good.
M|He's a weird guy.
A|You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
M|You're... I'm not sure
A|Uh-huh, that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.
M|this.that
A|So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
M|u.
A|Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.
M|You don't have to be a criminal to be in jail.
A|You,
M|I'm Chris Xero, son of Zeus.
A|And, It's really more of a, um, like a respect issue that the older, older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and, and they really seem as wise and, and in this country nobody really, Yeah, nobody really pays attention
M|It's in Richardson
A|Uh-huh.
M|Are you just gonna go and visit the museum?
A|I,
M|What about that?
A|Oh, that's good.
M|That's why they call it a bag.
A|Uh-huh.
M|This is?
A|Yeah. This is,
M|My cat's name is Tom, and he loves to play with the kids.
A|Yep.
M|You're, to be
A|Right. And then do it all over again. Uh-huh.
M|It was
A|So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.
M|It's fine.Thanks for the talk though
A|Yeah, that's, uh, spare time, with a child it's, kind of she's, we have, uh, we're looking for a baby-sitter so we've been out twice in in this year so far. By ourselves without the child
M|
A|Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly  but  you know, they get lesser sentences
M|you're saying you'd be ok with that?
A|oh, yeah, we they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
M|That's what I said.
A|Uh-huh
M|You said, uh, retirement, and I said, uhh, you said...
A|That's right.
M|I live in a small town in Ohio.
A|um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything I think
M|Goodbye to you
A|Are you?
M|for.
A|Right.
M|You are so cute.
A|Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.
M|I think he's just talking about how he got married to his daughter
A|so I figure that that will make me biased and I won't be chosen.
M|Uh, you know what to do.uh?
A|And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
M|I'm not a hero.
A|Right. Exactly. That's, because until, like eight,
M|I think we should be worried about the people who are in the military.
A|Uh-huh. But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me.
M|How do you?
A|Yeah.
M|You.
A|Yeah, yeah
M|Do you like jazz?
A|I know, and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady, but it's still not going up.
M|The reason you're doing this is because of the way the laws are.
A|So often I think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad. I work with a lot of elderly people, I'm a trust officer
M|It's
A|Oh, you're used to that, too.
M|I don't think that's a fair comparison.
A|I mean, Dallas is a very marked up area, although right now it's a lot lower um, because of all the layoffs and everything
M|Well
A|so. So, if we get what we what we deserve
M|I like the sound of the CRT's, and the CRTs are nice.
A|Yeah.
M|You can't be serious.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Just don't go
A|Uh, one's real nice, but the other one is a, well, she's pretty wild.
M|It's a shame that you're getting downvoted.
A|Well, we enjoyed having her here,
M|You were going to eat lunch?
A|In Clarion. Well, I live in Butler, but I'm at I'm at college. I'm at Clarion University.
