A|No earthly idea.
M|Uhh, what?
A|Which, uh, kind of taco turkey loaf. It was good. Uh, scalloped potatoes.
M|What do you mean?
A|Yeah, I voted absentee one year. I really was going to be gone. So, I did it, but, uh, it was nice. I would be tempted to do it again.
M|You know
A|Uh, I wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually. I mean, I know, it, it, it's tricky because I know, you know, an awful lot of intelligent people who just, well I'm too busy to serve on a jury,
M|...
A|We planted some yellow peppers this year. We've tried it, before
M|Just a normal one.
A|Right.
M|I've been using it for a year. I've been having issues with it
A|Well, yeah.  Yeah.
M|It's a shame they don't have a better way to spend money.
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.
M|Uhm.
A|Yes.
M|...
A|Yeah.
M|I think it's the other way around.
A|no. I'm not real familiar with that.

A|I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
M|I'm not sure if I'm being misunderstood or not.
A|Yes. Right.
M|Uuh, uh, uh...
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|The real question is, what do you do when you have to drop a hydraulic
A|Yeah. Um,
M|Yes. Yes it is.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|If you don't want to be in the military, you don't have to serve anyone.
A|And it started raining and I was hysterical. I was, I was, I mean, you would have thought a child had died.
M|That's what I said.
A|Yeah. But it's, I, I know.
M|She was in the hospital?
A|Well, yeah, it keeps, uh, well, it's doing real well, because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed
M|I don't
A|Yeah, that's good. I also, I was impressed by, uh, by the Mercedes, too.
M|It's in September.
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's a hard thing to say.
A|Yeah, really, especially in Texas
M|I'm still in L a lot
A|Because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers. And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
M|It's the, uh, limit.
A|So
M|uhuh. Uhuh.
A|and, um, but it's hard for him on Saturdays. He, he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,
M|So, you're not in the mood for a date?
A|That's great. Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life, so Might as well start now, huh?
M|Like, like, name one.
A|I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I, I think that we should be spending more time and, and again I don't think the, the Peace Corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. It doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
M|No. But do you talk to your parents about it?
A|They, they haven't the foggiest idea.
M|I guess I'm just, I'm sooooooo good at being a person.
A|Yeah,  I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
M|That's the best part.
A|Exactly.  We saw,  Yes, you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that. So.
M|They
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's like, but you go
A|one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and, she pushes the other one away from the food. Apparently I don't know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly.
M|I am a big fan of the Mercedes, but I think they're a little too.
A|Yeah. And I'll do this, uh, sometimes I'll put my after I pour that into my, back into my saucepan. I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg. So,
M|Uhhh, uh, um, yeah, uh...
A|Oh, all the time. Do you watch CHEERS
M|Uhm... what's wrong with that?
A|Yeah.
M|Not
A|and the roses have been blooming for two weeks, and the grass is, uh, this lush green, and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
M|Yeah, I'm not a fan of the taste
A|Yes, it is. I am, uh, like a Catholic and the people that go to my Church, you know Catholics dress very casual a lot of the times. People in jeans and in whatever, but yet the way I was raised, I am a converted Catholic, the way I was raised, I was raised a Baptist and like as a youngster I use to always dress up all the time. I guess that has changed also.
M|So you're not a bad person then.
A|I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff. The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.
M|That's the N
A|Yes, it's really kind of sad, and, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, right in our own back door.
M|No, I can.
A|Right.
M|... and it was just, you know, not very
A|Yeah.
M|No, they teach you how to go on and on and learn another way.
M|You read, uh, I'm sorry, new, uh.
