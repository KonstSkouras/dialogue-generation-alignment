M|It's a reference to the book.
A|So, not, I, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury, but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be,  things like that.
M|I don't have much to say about it.
A|But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.

M|But then how would you know it was the cat?
A|Oh.

A|Yes,  we sure do, smoke them
M|I think you're
A|Two living areas. We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
M|Aha! I can't!
A|Uh-huh. The Really? Okay.
M|Oh. Well I think I'm going to do it anyway.
A|Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
M|She is the only one who can be a ballplayer.
A|and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.
M|What about the dog?
A|No, huh-uh. Uh, I think they're interesting.
M|... I'm sorry
A|It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
M|I'd like to know why you think it's a good idea to get a job with the government if you don't have a job.
A|That's it.
M|Uu '
A|Many of the boys in the room had children and they were, they were high school juniors.
M|I guess so

M|I think he was just saying that if he didn't do it, he wouldn't have.
A|like for drugs, for drugs they, they enforce the death penalty for that. Uh, they're just, very, very tough, and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too, or Japan is too. They're just very tough on criminals.
M|Yeah.You?
A|Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent. It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast and it was
M|Do you live in the back of the house?
A|And we just had a really big ice storm. And, basically, half the trees in, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh right upstate. Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore.
M|That's why I keep a high school teacher's number.
A|Yeah, over uncooked rice
M|The second reunion, uh, what?
A|Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Uh-huh. Sure, sure,
M|Uuhh, I'm.
A|Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference. Right now,  I don't see it making a difference.
M|I'd have a, uh, uh.
A|And how they would expect, how they would hope,
M|Hey! You're not from Texas.
A|And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
M|I think the best thing about the benefits is the availability of the benefits.
A|One little ball here and there, yeah, and this guy's beating you up, so, I don't know the beating up part. I, I actually feel the tennis balls would hurt.
M|Upper Saint Clare
A|And myself, I guess.
M|That's the plan. I have a lot of practice
A|Local you mean?
M|you can't be the most powerful man in the world, if you are the most dangerous man in a parking lot, you're not doing your job
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yeah. Uh.
A|Uh-huh.
M|s.
A|That , um, I wonder sometimes
M|
A|Because I don't like credit cards for one thing, you know, I mean, they're okay, I guess, if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,
M|What about Monday night?
A|learn how to adapt, learn how to grow in the, in their college or whatever education they might take. Well, that, that's good, that's good.
M|Huehuehuhueh.
A|And, uh, it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when I hear it at other places, or when I, you know, see some, see and hear someone playing. I sort of watch their technique, too, and, and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning.
M|Uhhh, there was some places.
A|Yeah, or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,
M|i
A|Uh-huh.   Yeah, I just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate, I mean I just don't, uh, oh, I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, and I just, the subject, I remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things
M|It's a good deterrent
A|That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
M|Uhh, I think that's just weird.
A|Well , that's, That's, um, pampering the, the petals
M|Ayea
A|It gives you confidence. In my business if I call on the the J C Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago, then I wear coat and tie. If I call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, I might be casual.
M|N?
A|Huh.  You learn  something every day.
M|
A|Uh-huh.
M|They have to leave it on the ground, so it will not decompose
A|Yeah, yeah. That's another thing.  You have to go to different places to do that.
M|I have never played it, but I've been meaning to
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|What? I don't understand the point of your comment.
A|So, do you think, it was overdeveloped then?
M|Ah, I see.
A|Oh, uh-huh.
M|Uhh, yeah.
A|Yeah.
M|What's your day
A|Yeah, that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened. It comes in like a real dark can,
M|Yes.
A|Oh, I hear , Yes, that's true.
M|The worst part is, we don't
A|So he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,
M|you, you're
A|I think that's true.
M|She shrugs.
A|Are you in Texas, now?
M|It's not about the economy. It's about the economic situation.
A|Yeah
M|i
A|I imagine.
M|Yes. The US is a country.
A|that's entering the day as well.
M|It's just the guilt of the time.
A|I believe it is too.
M|He was the last one, but he was only there for a couple of days.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Good luck with the rest of course?
A|Yeah, isn't it funny.
M|Yup. It's all about the money
A|And, uh, this was during a holdup of a, uh, uh, a restaurant and it came out during the trial that, um, they had tried to rob another place and, uh, when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a couple cookies, and, uh, you know, jumbo cookies and, and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.
M|Um... What?
A|I can do it on most any day of the week.
M|Yeah, uh, uh.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, I've seen that.
M|But, uh, I don't, I'm a woman, so...
A|Yeah. One nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, you know, too many.
M|It
A|Yeah, I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.
M|Ah, right.
A|Well I'll tell you. I I think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag, it would never happen do you know what I mean?
M|He was a Saint Claude
A|So many times.
M|That's the point of the place.But I don'think you'll be able to find it in time.
