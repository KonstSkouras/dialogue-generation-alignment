A|Yeah. Right. Right, you got a little ways to go, too Right .
M|You know, I'm sure I'd rather be in a nursing home than a hospital.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
M|
A|And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
M|that is the joke
A|You know. Uh-huh.
M|Didn't you have special programs on your computers to do it?
A|Were you in the band?

M|You know what I mean.
A|Dye Mound?
M|I have a rule that my daughter can't be involved in any sports. I have to get her out of the house
A|I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
M|Hah, ah. I, ah, ah... I don't.
A|you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
M|Hm? Huh?
A|Well, it was good talking to you.
M|And, uh, if you
A|Oh, that's how they do it.
M|Do they?
A|Boy, they'll strip,
M|Well uh, I have no kids.
A|My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult. Was she in favor of it or, or was she kind of opposed to it?
M|I can see the future.
A|And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano, well, it's not little any more.
M|Ok, bye.
A|Sure. You got to inspect it, yeah.
M|I'm not sure if I'm a little bit biased or not, but I don't see any difference.
A|That's not too bad. That's north.
M|He got elected, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to call him the president.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M|What do you not
A|and I, uh, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
M|I know.
A|so, it's okay.
M|I think we have one room, but that's all
A|And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
M|I don't think I'm gonna read the whole thing, I think I'll just wait for the next one.
A|there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here, and so,
M|You.
A|they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to doing it. I keep saying we need to have one. They go, okay, then start one. But everybody wants to do it but, you know, God's sitting on my heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, but anyway, so they could really only have four members on the team. I think they only have four boys . I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
M|They're a bunch of twisted people.
A|Yeah, that's exactly it.
M|We
A|I'd be, I mean I'd be tried by a jury of you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things, and, uh, I don't know,
M|It would be interesting to see how many people would go.
A|And then I want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and I want an air bag and, uh, I guess,
M|Is that a dog?
A|Uh-huh. Yeah, that's true.
M|It isnt.But if they had to spend a lot more money on advertising, it wouldnt be a lot, but it would be.
A|No. Yeah. There was a, T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs. And, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know, and that's, they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program. It's, you know, T I doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that. And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
M|i think it's just a weird coincidence.
A|I mean she actually asks to go out.
M|You know what, you're right.
A|Uh-huh. That will be neat, yeah.
M|They are... but are they?
A|Right.
M|He's also got the ability to move his car.
