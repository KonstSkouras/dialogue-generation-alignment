0,sorry,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.","Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument. I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Um, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. Uh, but then why not pay, pay the sales tax Corporations have to, why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?","What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?","Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line. Devil's advocate possibly, but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law, you're still circumventing it. You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.","So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?"
1,,Yes.,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania.

2,they,"Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So I go outside the area for that. And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state. I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.",Yes.,"Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania.

3,:You,"I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get. With some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?","Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area.

4,pox. anyways,"Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.","I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.

6,",What.Oh",Right. But the point is is that businesses do that.

9,U.,"That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.

11,are,"No. Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah.

14,N?,"So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.
