31,"If you're driving on the right, you can go down.","Until you pull the pin, yeah.","Yes, until you release it.","Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, but you, it won't go down.","Okay, okay.","Very similar, yeah."
32,It's a small one.,All right.,"Until you pull the pin, yeah.","Yes, until you release it.","Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, but you, it won't go down.","Okay, okay."
