0,"Um, I'm not really sure, but it's an interesting question.","and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling",Hello Chuck.,Hello Ann.
1,"Uhhh, did you go to the E O?",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling",Hello Chuck.
2,Umm... I think that's a myth.,"and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling"
3,"Uhhh, uh, I didn't think that the EPUB was a thing yet.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.
4,"i mean, it is new","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places"
5,I don't know. I'm just a little confused.,"Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.
6,That's what they want you to think.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.","Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste."
7,The E P a is a pretty new proposal.,Uh-huh.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions.

8,I'morry,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print",Uh-huh.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions.

10,The money,"and they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away.",Yeah.,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print.

11,.,"Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.","and they could sell it for a while.

12,.,"Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though.

13,This is it,Uh-huh.,"Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though.

14,c'?,"There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation",Uh-huh.,"Yeah.

16,But they can't get it back.,and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.,Right.,"There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up.

17,I've had a few people have said that they're not buying it.,"Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

18,I'm interested,"So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.","Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

19,,"Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet","So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.","Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

20,U?,Uh-huh.,"Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle.

21,they are recy recycle,"and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.",Uh-huh.,"Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle.

22,the recycle recycle,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill","and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled.

24,...,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

26,I hate,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

27,I was just joking,Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.
28,I'msigh,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them."
29,Solar panels can't even do that.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.
30,Why? What's the point?,So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space"
31,But... carbon dioxide emissions are only a problem if you are burning it.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.
32,Carbon fuel,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.  Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity."
33,I know that. I mean it's just paper.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.  Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.
34,How is that even possible?,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.  Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.
35,I'll burn it.,Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.  Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?"
36,"Yeah, but what's the point?",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever.  Well that was he didn't deal with that.
37,Yeah. She's a good cook,"No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.
38,You don't know how it works?,"Yeah, well, real interesting.","No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.
39,I was just wondering,Did it change anything for you?,"Yeah, well, real interesting.","No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay
