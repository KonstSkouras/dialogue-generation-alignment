A:	Hi Ed.
B:	Hi.
A:	Hi.
B:	Uh, books, I've, actually I am reading a couple of different books, uh, one is, uh, a story, well it is not a story, it is a collection of, uh, of memos, supposedly written by Howard Hughes, uh,
A:	Oh.
B:	that was, uh, that was, it came out a couple of years ago and I have just now gotten around to reading it. I have had it a couple years, but, uh,
A:	Who wrote that?
B:	Oh, I do not remember the man's name, he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two, and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell, and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.
A:	Huh.
B:	They, on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles, they used to have a, or, I guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected, he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything, he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, And had ended up,
A:	I see.
B:	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect, and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from Hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main assistant back, uh, in the fifties and well, I guess, in the sixties, up until his death.
A:	Well, that is interesting. Right.
B:	So, it's pretty interesting work so,
A:	That is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
B:	Yeah, it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard you have to plod through it and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
A:	And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
B:	No, I have not seen it. But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,
A:	Yeah.
B:	uh, I also reading, uh, the, uh, it's a, an old, another old book that I happen to have. I am sort of rereading it. It's, uh, a book about, uh, the Bermuda Triangle, but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian, he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, Bermuda Triangle. You know, he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,
A:	Uh. Explained , *listen; could be br
B:	and, you know. Uh, and the reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen. And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's, uh, Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two, and they were, they were lost and, uh,
A:	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
B:	Yeah, they were.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And so, and in the book, you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth. And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
A:	Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
B:	Uh, no, I have not.
A:	I, I think that would be, I am sure there is something out there, uh, ,
B:	Yeah, I would I would like to, too, because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of of where she ,
A:	I thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
B:	Uh
A:	Well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Of course, you know, it is so weird, cause no one will ever really know, it's, it, so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things.
B:	Right.
A:	That is for sure.
B:	Yeah. So, that is pretty much for right now, that is, what I have been reading.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I kind of like to read different stuff and, uh, I like to read a novel every now and then, but, uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
A:	Right. Well, I, I guess I just have not read I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
B:	Yes.
A:	And I just really, really liked the way he writes. It's just, incredible.
B:	Yeah, I read that, too. I got it, uh, right, after it came out. My, uh, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book, and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in Chicago, and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this, this guy is, you know, from here.
A:	Uh.
B:	And, uh, I read it and really liked it and then about, that is when it really got big. And, uh, so I,
A:	That was good, I think. And, and the other book I am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year and I think I did read Tom Wolfe and VANITY, uh,
B:	OF THE VANITY ,
A:	BON yeah.
B:	I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.
A:	Uh. Yeah I, that was really, really good, the movie was nothing compared to the book.
B:	Yeah, that is what I have heard.
A:	And. Yeah.
B:	I saw the movie, and, uh,
A:	Oh, the movie was a joke compared to, I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
B:	Yeah. Right.
A:	and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
B:	Right. I know.
A:	And, anyway, we are not talking about that, but, uh, gee, I just I like to read gardening books and things like that. Just to tell me what to do with my garden and, uh, And, uh,
B:	Yeah. I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that I am, I do computer work and so I have a lot of those. So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I, I'm interested in a lot of that, but, uh, I have got a lot of books that I, I intend to read, but I have not been able to yet, you know, for one reason or another.
A:	Like, what is a book on your list, you know I have a list too and I have never gotten to it
B:	Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list, cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know, I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh, I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book and, uh, uh,
A:	Oh.
B:	I have one and I can not remember the name of it, uh, it is supposed to be a mystery.
