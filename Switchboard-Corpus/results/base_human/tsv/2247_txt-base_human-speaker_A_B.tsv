A:	Okay, um, now the term personal computer, uh, I don't happen to have one at home. Um, but I do have a personal computer on my desk here.
B:	A type of work station?
A:	Yeah, uh, yeah, just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process. And, uh, it, it works just fine. It says it's a monochrome monitor, Panasonic printer, uh, no big deal, it, it does the things I need for it to do.
B:	Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine?
A:	No, it's not even that.
B:	It's eighty eighty-eight?
A:	Uh, I think that's about where it is.
B:	Okay. Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously.
A:	Uh, yeah, I do that, I, I do, uh, some Lotus on it. Uh, do some, uh, Samna, some, uh, P F M, uh, nothing extremely complex.
B:	Okay. Uh, I use them both here at work and at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have I B M clones in both cases.
A:	Yep.
B:	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
A:	Oh, yeah. I bet that's a pretty nice setup.
B:	Yes, it is. Uh, unfortunately I need all of it.
A:	Yep.
B:	Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
A:	Wow.
B:	And that, I know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
A:	Yep.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.
A:	Wow.
B:	And then I have, uh, a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm really pleased with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
A:	Sure. Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. Have you,
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	To try to make them more effective and useful.
A:	Right.
B:	Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
A:	Well, um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M, and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect. So, I can never quite stay current with that.
B:	Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The, at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from.
A:	Oh. Huh. I can I can believe that.
B:	Very frustrating. Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. You come here with the B level of specs?
A:	No, not really. I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.
B:	Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.
A:	Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
B:	Well, I sure need them. Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them.
A:	I can believe that. Well, it's, it's been interesting.
B:	Yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. When you start seeing what all they can do for you.
A:	Yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
B:	Well, I understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
A:	I is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?
B:	Right.
A:	That, that must be a fairly recent release.
B:	Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
A:	Okay, okay. Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
B:	It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
A:	Sure. Yeah.
B:	Well, okay. I enjoyed our discussion.
A:	I did too, and you have a good day.
B:	You do the same.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye.
