B:	Okay, what kind of puppy you got?
A:	Well, uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd. Uh, she was, uh, uh, a person lives across the street from me, uh, brought her home from work because a coworker of hers, uh, had this dog appear on its front doorstep,
B:	Uh.
A:	somebody, somebody abandoned her and, she's only about, oh, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
B:	Oh.
A:	She's, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
B:	Wow.
A:	I mean she actually asks to go out.
B:	That's great.
A:	And, uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
B:	Yeah, well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, she just appeared.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, but we've had her now for about three years,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I just, you get so attached to them.
A:	Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
B:	Um. Wow.
A:	um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
B:	Oh no.
A:	So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard.
B:	Oh, gee.
A:	And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
B:	Oh, I bet.
A:	And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did and, uh. She was really attached to it,
B:	Oh gosh.
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
B:	Yeah, yeah. How long has it been since the first one?
A:	Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
B:	Uh, yeah,
A:	Uh, it was in March of last year. So, uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
B:	Yeah. Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me. I mean I was just, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore
A:	Right.
B:	And then God gave me this dog, so
A:	My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	no how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, I or, I Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing, but, mom went an,
B:	Okay, yeah. Well you just do,
A:	Yeah.
B:	you can't help it's like, it's like a kid.
A:	Yeah, it is. Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
B:	Yeah, well when, uh, my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
A:	Yeah.
B:	like who knows, you know.
A:	Right.
B:	But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
A:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	she doesn't have a brown nose, and her she's sort of unicolor, you know, eyes are the same color and everything,
A:	Yeah.
B:	so. I named her Rosebud, and, uh, a friend of mine said, she, that she this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years
A:	That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
B:	Yeah, right.
A:	they're always, always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
B:	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
A:	Yeah.
B:	You know, she loves everybody. And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
A:	Right.
B:	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
A:	This, this friend of mine has, well it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this, they just, they had a ball romping around,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
B:	Getting in, yeah.
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
B:	Oh, no.
A:	Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
B:	Really.
A:	But he jumped in, in the, the river.
B:	Did puppy go to?
A:	Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
B:	Oh, that's good, yeah.
A:	'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
B:	Ugh, ugh.
A:	And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.
B:	Yeah,
A:	Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and so, but, uh, she got over it, so.
B:	Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
A:	Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I mean, I've got, the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose, but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so.
B:	Yeah Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah, and she, oh baths. Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Have you seen, uh, CANINE. The movie, oh,
A:	No, no.
B:	you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German, it is so cute.
A:	Oh really.
B:	Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
A:	Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
B:	Yeah, well that's how Cleo, you know, she'd lay on her step,
A:	Yeah.
B:	but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
A:	Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
B:	Yeah, but you really need to see that movie. I, I we bought the movie and I I don't know how many times I've seen it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it came on T V the other night and I was watching it again, and my husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
A:	I'll have to check it out. I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie, but,
B:	It is great.
A:	uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, I got to do more, more fun things.
B:	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
A:	Yeah, yeah. Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so I travel a lot.
B:	Oh really.
A:	And yeah, I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, so.
B:	Oh.
A:	That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But it's nice having a dog here, uh, the,
B:	Oh, yeah, there's just,
A:	uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
B:	Right, that's it.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Really, not critical at all.
A:	No, no.
B:	Yeah, they're really wonderful.
A:	Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
