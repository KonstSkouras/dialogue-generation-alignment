A:	Okay
B:	Okay Carol. So, air quality.
A:	Yeah. Is it, like water running and she is doing I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, then again I originally was from California and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California. And, uh  they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
B:	Surely.
A:	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's ...
B:	You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
A:	No, not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
B:	Right. I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.
A:	Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.
B:	Oh, really
A:	Uh-huh We're  packing and getting ready to go to .
B:	Yeah. Actually, I'm a California born person.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about. In L A, it's pretty bad.
A:	Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, you do then.
B:	Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.
A:	Is it really?
B:	Yes.
A:	I would not imagine that.
B:	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
A:	Huh.
B:	The most polluted city in the world
A:	Huh. You learn  something every day.
B:	. Yeah. I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, I've seen that.
B:	Uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
A:	Huh.
B:	You ever heard of that?
A:	Huh-uh.
B:	Yeah. Methanol?
A:	Huh. No
B:	Yeah. Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
A:	Oh, yeah Yeah.
B:	Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
A:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	It doesn't make sense. Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world  is corn.
A:	Right. Huh. And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Huh.
B:	Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that. It's interesting. They're, they're looking at, there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
A:	Huh That is good.
B:	Unlike a car where it's running.
A:	Yeah.
B:	A electric car it's on demand. I mean it's either on or off.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Basically.
A:	Huh.
B:	You don't have to shift So you, cars become very simple all  of a sudden too.
A:	Oh.
B:	Very interesting.
A:	That would be nice. I think I saw that on T V one time. They, maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
B:	Yeah. There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars.
A:	Huh.
B:	And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.
A:	But what, I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like
B:	Right. Yeah
A:	I don't know. Huh. * See note above
B:	G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, well they actually have an electric minivan. Yeah. Their, their Caravan. But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars right now.
A:	Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too. .
B:	"To operate, yeah. But, you know, people are buying them. You know whose buying them? *""whose"" = who's"" The power company. Free, you know, free for them."
A:	Well, yeah. Yeah.
B:	Kind of interesting so see.
A:	Well, it doesn't make sense. Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. So it's  a good, good  vehicle.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know. So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
B:	Oh, I wasn't there too long ago. Uh.
A:	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
B:	Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley?
A:	Yeah.
B:	You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
A:	Well, we were there when they had a
