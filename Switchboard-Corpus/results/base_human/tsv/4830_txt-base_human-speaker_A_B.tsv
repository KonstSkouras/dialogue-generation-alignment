A:	You want to go first?
B:	No, you can start
A:	Okay. Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.
B:	Right.
A:	you know what I mean?
B:	Right. There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	there, there's no way. We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
A:	That's it.
B:	Uh, every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.
A:	Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
B:	Right.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know, all these things. I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
B:	Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal.
A:	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
B:	Yep.
A:	I, I think this is a little ridiculous.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
B:	Oh, that's right. I work for a law firm
A:	I, I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
B:	Right.
A:	You know, if someone is
B:	Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
A:	Well.
B:	Plea bargaining is something completely different. That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up.
A:	Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly but  you know, they get lesser sentences
B:	Right.
A:	and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.
B:	Right.
A:	But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
B:	Huh.
A:	you know what I'm saying? That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh I, I think they should.
B:	We do
A:	I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people and, uh, you know, all
B:	Right.
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
B:	Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned.
A:	Yeah.
B:	We just have the case, I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up
A:	Oh, really.
B:	So, I mean, his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
A:	It, uh, Yeah.
B:	But, uh, that was absurd There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
A:	I know that, that Uh-huh. And, I don't know. Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?
B:	Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd. There's no way that could work.
A:	Oh, yeah. I, I, I don't agree with that at all.
B:	Uh, but,
A:	Imagine the guilt that person would have. I mean  burned out.
B:	Oh, exactly.
A:	There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
B:	Exactly. Right.
A:	If you had to do something like that, day after day.
B:	No one would want the job
A:	No. Not really.
B:	Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
A:	Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
B:	Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury. That, that, that right
A:	I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.
B:	Well, I mean, were there witnesses?
A:	In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
B:	Right. Right. That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
A:	Yeah.
B:	and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances
A:	Well, I, I,
