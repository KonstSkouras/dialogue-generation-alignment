B:	Okay.
A:	Uh, go ahead.
B:	What are we supposed to discuss again?
A:	AIDS research is something that, that, I think whether our country is putting enough money into it
B:	More money )),
A:	and actually I'm concerned that they're not. I have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And these were from other, people from other countries. He's a translator.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And in talking to the people from France he said, you know, he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is. And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
B:	Huh.
A:	Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more. I don't know that spending more always gets it.
B:	Yeah. I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary. I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases, and, uh, I mean whether,
A:	You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
B:	Yes.
A:	yeah.
B:	And, uh, whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then part of it's lack of education. I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
A:	Well it, I, I agree with you there because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served? Uh, that's a good point.
B:	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things. One is preventing the spread and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't have any opinion.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
A:	Well, and one of the things I'd, and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
B:	Yeah, well, you know,
A:	That's, that's the part that,
B:	t-, whether my dentist or
A:	That's the part that scares me, you know. I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals, well no, it's for homosexuals and gays, well no, actually, it's, I mean, you know. Did they know that all along?
B:	and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes. And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not. Can't get it from mosquitoes. And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions, yes.
A:	Oh
B:	And I don't know that's true or not. I mean, I just heard it in passing, but so what does that,
A:	Right.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
A:	And how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Which is, I think, what they also don't know. I mean that's, I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
B:	No.
A:	In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that, and it's huge over there. So I, I, you know, and it's beginning, other countries that's what's his point. This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?
B:	Oh.
A:	I mean I don't know. All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know. Uh, or maybe they understand but,
B:	I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
A:	Yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back. If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
B:	I, I, give me cyanide. I mean, is it )),
A:	Yeah, right. I'll take anything you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.
B:	Ri-, Exactly.
A:	Go ahead.
B:	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
A:	Exactly.
B:	let them, do it.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I think they're saying too.
