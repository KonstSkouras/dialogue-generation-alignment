A|Uh-huh.
B|my  wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. BON APPETITE, and FOOD AND WINE and GOURMET.
A|Yeah. Yeah, I like those
B|Uh, so I guess that's one option.
A|and, uh, I've got carrots, I yes, I've got a few carrots up and I've got some radishes up,
B|I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,
A|Yeah.
B|I don't to men, it seems like the women out just out live their husbands, but, very reluctantly, that  whole, I mean
A|Yeah.
B|He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with? At least he didn't eat them, I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.
A|Okay I wasn't sure. Most of the ones, you know, up north and everything do, but, um, anyway, it's, uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area. Most of this area was developed, this house was built in seventy-four.
B|And boy that thing screams now.
A|Yeah.
B|it, it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and, and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent,
A|and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, I think that is an excellent program, I really do. I like that. And it's, it's beneficial to the small towns too because, they really, really have, have a disadvantage that we wouldn't understand because we're in the Metroplex.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh,
B|Right.
A|I mean, if your going to sentence somebody, let's say twenty years, let them stay twenty years.
B|And so, we, uh, I was just looking, for example there is a, uh, condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live, and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom, which is essentially a two bedroom apartment.
A|So we took those back, and that's about that all that were taken back in ages.
B|So,
A|Oh.
B|Uh-huh. I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
A|Yeah. I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
B|Yeah
A|so.
B|No, I do not.
A|Really.
B|I asked myself.
A|In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that, you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house, but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have
B|It's a whole new, Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|I'm serious.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Yeah, we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees. We have a peach tree. That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply. But that's nice to have
A|Yeah.
B|So they're professionals?
A|Yeah, right that's I think that's the only thing that's going to change it.
B|Uh-huh.
A|This is great. Well, we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans And, um, we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again. That was pretty pitiful, but they seem to be doing pretty good this year.
B|Yeah,
A|Maybe.
B|This is nothing like cats.
A|Yes, and that's, that's one thing I do have.
B|I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services. It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes.
A|Yeah.
B|Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile.
A|And of course, you know, they tried to make the cop look like he was, uh, a, uh, no good rotten drunk.
B|Just started shooting people,  because they botched the first job
A|Well, that is good.
B|Oh, I know,
A|and then when I would come home and he would leave, and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know, someone came home and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something. It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh. Yeah I, that was really, really good, the movie was nothing compared to the book.
B|It was nice talking to you.
A|And, uh, I don't know whether that's bad or good, it's just a point that I have observed that we,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Huh?
