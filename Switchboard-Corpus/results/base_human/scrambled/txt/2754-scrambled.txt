A|I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
B|It's probably happened to millions of people,
A|Well, great. That's excellent.
B|Uh-huh
A|Oh.
B|Yeah.
A|and she is charging out of her mind already. And I'm going, you just got off. That's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,
B|Uh, and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in, in the car, so we have the advantage of being able to, uh, read and drive although there seems to be, from what I've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
A|you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know, we'll have a freeze.
B|Did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of,
A|Say, that good, I think that's, like the state of Virginia, yeah, that's great.
B|and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country, you don't have to worry about any of that
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. Right.
A|Uh-huh.
B|It was really nice so
A|but. Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
B|and they just get away with it, and nothing happens.
A|Right, , they don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.
A|No, I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
B|Uh-huh.
A|No. I don't, I did it by hand,
B|No, we are west.
A|and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Did you really?
B|But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society.
A|So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.
B|I really don't watch that much T V, what I do is I tape the programs I want to watch, and then on the nights I can watch, I'll pick out something.
A|Huh.
B|I know it. I said, why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers, you know?
A|Uh-huh.
B|So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I mean, you honestly do. Now I have friends that I love to death, but, and they have children, but their children does anything, we have to take them, and, you know to do it.
B|Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift and, what, I'm, I'm curious. I, I know why I love a stick shift. Why why did you want one?
A|but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
B|yeah. So what's it been like up there?
A|Yes and,
B|And it was an older car,
A|My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
B|No, no.
A|and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
B|Well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal?
A|so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.
B|Uh, that's great.
A|Yeah, well, you learned then, right?
B|Yeah, well, it's very therapeutic, I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.
A|Oh yeah, they do.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, you are?
B|I think so.
A|Most of the time
B|I'm sure they will.
A|Okay. Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, did we, what do we think about a judge making the decision?
B|Right.
A|All right. Thank you. Bye, bye.
B|But that's another subject but,
A|Well, I just watch them.
B|Yes. Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh, which seems so awful.
B|And so, uh, you know, at work a lot of people are, you know, I think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in. Most of them, uh, continue to work if they have, have kids.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
B|Uh, other than that it was a at best.
A|It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
B|It was, uh, you know, it's easier to join them than fight them.
A|That's right.
B|Oh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, right.
A|Oh.
B|Oh.
A|Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Well, very good, I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits
B|Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned but, uh, not, nobody, no, I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh, It's just, it, it's a really tough question
A|Uh-huh.
B|Golly.
A|and I don't have that in my current operation, but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, in Yeah, it's really different because that's kind of the, you know, that's the chalk hills down there,  limestone hills,
A|Oh, I like that too. But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
B|Yeah.
A|How do you dress for work?
B|And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in East Texas, which is a hundred miles from here.
A|I,
B|Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year, they're grown and gone from home now
A|No, no I think the um sometimes I guess what did I read recently the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.
B|Uh-huh.
A|But she got credits for it?
B|No.
A|Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days. But I, ,
B|and, uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you have, just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up you know,
A|Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, so.
B|It really does, and, and I've seen the same thing that you're talking about, uh, much more crime than ever before. Drugs of course, uh, a big part of it I think.
A|We have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
B|Right. Yeah
A|All right. I've never done it before, so I guess that's all I have to do, right
B|You know, I like what he says, and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
A|I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.
B|Yeah.
A|I think some of them would rather be in jail
B|It is. Have you been living there very long?
A|Yeah.
B|No.
A|Uh-huh.
B|I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know. If it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was innocent and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
A|What part of the country are you in?
B|That's okay Um, I've, I've thought about that, too, and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here
A|Are you?
B|Uh-huh.
