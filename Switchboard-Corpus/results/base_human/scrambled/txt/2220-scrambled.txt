A|and, uh, really need a faster system. Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.

A|Well, I don't know about you, but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks, and I'm ready for it to come back.
B|Now,
A|Yeah. Yeah. And I think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything, and oh, it was just awful. So, um, I don't know I think we have just become really spoiled. But I think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled

A|Uh, you know,
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, heavy involvement from the public.
A|you, you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime, there was something on, and this gets back to capital punishment, but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
B|Basically about the same as what you've probably had.

A|Oh, yeah.
B|Some beet, uh, potatoes
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right. Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something, so
B|Really great,
A|Which is rare.
B|Oh uh-huh.
A|Oh, so you've heard the Richardson Symphony?
B|it really does the job. But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. And if you're not really committed to it, I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week, and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something, and by then it's burned up, you know.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh. Right. Wow.
A|I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
B|he was going to keep him as the coach somehow, but, uh, I don't know, I'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow.
A|Thank you. Well, that was one minute. They hung up.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, that, uh, if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.
A|Oh, uh-huh.
B|Yeah, it is tough. It's, and I don't know who's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on implementing it, if they do.
A|That's funny. Where is he from in France? Uh-huh.
B|of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
A|It's exciting.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, I agree, absolutely, and you know, it's all relative, because I was from West Texas, and it was very dry, and so I thought Dallas was awful, and I still think so, but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week, and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning. They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
B|and that was just trying to hold us, getting out of that was a used car.
A|Okay.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh.

A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, I, I, yeah, I, I, I truly believe that, that before that, that we have to address the racial, racial issues in the United States, before we can go anywhere.
A|but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
B|Uh-huh.
