A|Right, not much.
B|there, there's no way. We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
A|Um, they, they made a couple of those, uh, they made one for my, uh, bridal shower and I was pretty pleased. I never made one for myself though. But they look easy enough to make it's not,
B|I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago. In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it. I'll never forget. Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner. I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him They remodeled the entire back yard. Then they sold the house and got divorced, so I don't know what that says about it all
A|Yeah, that's true,
B|Okay.
A|and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.
B|That that might be a better way to do it.
A|I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
B|Yes, I have a dog and cat now.
A|So, uh, we play that a lot of them, and, uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
B|Oh, my God.
A|Oh, yeah. Yeah.
B|Back by that.
A|Uh-huh.
B|and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
A|Um, yeah, that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe, well, it says, why would you, what you would have for a dinner party. Um, this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin.
B|No, no, it, no I don't go to East Texas. I got a degree from T W U, but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, but I don't want to be a lawyer so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant.
A|No, actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, no maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare and,  but this is from Hong Kong,
B|It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
A|Yeah, but, um,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh, that's terrible.
B|Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for.
A|Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument. I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Um, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. Uh, but then why not pay, pay the sales tax Corporations have to, why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?
B|And, uh, so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, uh, just really help a lot
A|Okay. Well,
B|Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.
A|Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm not sure either. But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.
B|Um, so where do you live in Pennsylvania?
A|Remember that?
B|Oh, wow. Oh, my goodness.
A|That's true.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Glaucoma.
B|If you want to,  do it quickly.
A|so it's like completely opposed. I don't know, which do I like better, I think I like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
B|Never.
A|Yeah. That would be exciting.
B|Yeah.
A|I think so, I think because people sort of get through, you know, um, I think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the, as well as, you know, some mental fitness and I think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.
B|And we like movies, that yeah.
A|Okay, well, thanks.
B|And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
A|Right. And actually in, in summer I like to swim. We don't have facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake, I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
B|Think you,
A|with, someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know. Is really kind of bad
B|also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah
A|Absolutely. They really go through it,
B|but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit. Uh, my daughter lives in Arlington, and when I go to visit her, I love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to Southern Virginia or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although I don't do that regularly.
A|I mean they're nomadic farmers, you know, they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.
B|That's, uh, yeah, really true. But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats, they have four of them, and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh, every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.
A|Uh, got kids?
B|Cooking chocolate.
A|And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
B|Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
A|Yeah.
B|See.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, absolutely.
A|Yeah. They're real neat.
B|Right.
A|So, I, I can see the advantage to that one. The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?
B|Yeah. Yeah, it just gets so hot so fast here. We don't have really a Spring or a Fall
A|Yeah.
B|That's okay.
A|Make a mean spaghetti, huh?
B|So, I hope so.
A|Oh, really. It's hard.
B|Yeah, you can't enjoy it. Right.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|I think it must have been terribly boring to go through,  your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.
A|My wife used to plant a few snow peas. I don't really care for snow peas. Well, she just plants a few for herself.
B|Uh-huh.
A|You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
B|and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to, you know, like, thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know,
A|Sure.
B|What
A|Yeah.
B|yeah
A|Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea
B|but usually it's not until later It's really strange.
A|Well, yes.
B|Have a good,
A|Uh I think that uh you know I I just read something I think in TIME magazine uh about um protest
B|Uh, Clarion County.
A|But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year. I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|And, uh, we were never much of, uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh
A|Exactly.
B|or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
A|they just say do you believe in such and such. Uh,
B|Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family. I do other things very well,
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|You
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh really?
