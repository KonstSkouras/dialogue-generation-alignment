A|Okay.
B|You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude, and say, huh, you know, why should we vote, then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things.
A|Uh, I can't remember. Refresh my memory.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh.
B|Yeah. I don't take much more in myself.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Um, like, like Europe,  um, England. I know the taxes are a lot higher.
A|It's just, I don't, I don't know, I just
B|I'm in a, uh, in a ranch. A, uh, it was about, uh, sixteen hundred square feet when I bought it, and, uh, it's about two thousand square feet now, but it's one of those typical, uh, ranches that you find around here. Oh, it's, uh, built in the, probably built in the late fifties so it's not, um, what you would find, uh, where you live. But, uh, for the older, uh, ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess.
A|Huh That is good.
B|Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them.
A|Uh-huh. We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though, our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.
B|Yeah. So how old is your retriever?
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I was just reading an article in, uh, a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, uh, letters of applications to universities.
B|Yes. Yes.
A|Well, uh, that's great. We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit and then he does all the repairing, you know, he does
B|Yep.
A|Yeah, I think you're right.
B|Uh huh.
A|And, uh.
B|Strange.
A|Uh-huh. Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know.
B|Oh, gee, I heard Aspen got three feet.
A|And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too. I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.
B|You know,
A|so, I think she'll adjust,
B|So, right now we're just,
A|Huh.
B|and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat, and he let her out, and my house was loaded with fleas, I mean, you walked in and your legs were just black.
A|Visit.
B|and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
A|Okay.
B|Uh-huh.
A|You do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways and I know Manhattan's real expensive but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?
B|Yeah
A|but it's not going to, Oh, I see.
B|Um, I, I understand that it's being proposed as a requirement, for, uh, young people to be, to go into public service.
A|And that, I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. It was really,
B|But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, you know, reasonable.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Well, thank you.
A|Well, they fear being dependent  on somebody.
B|and then she grew to be, you know, I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Oh, definitely. I think better even than, than other kinds of food
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh. Yes.
A|Well.
B|Right. You know, the war last winter was certainly a good example of that  because we saw every single thing, practically.
A|Oh, now we really get sick
B|Oh, I do too.
A|Uh-huh. Right.
B|Uh-huh Uh, yeah. I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ. I have been raised in the Church of Christ and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best uh, uh, and dress and proper attire
A|You can, you can tell them anything and they won't tell anybody.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|and I don't have to concentrate too hard on them.
A|Uh, bye.
B|Well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in the, the immediate, you know, Washington area.
A|and they buried her alive
B|Oh.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|and there's a variety. Some of them is, uh, BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES, PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED? They, they rotate those around, and, um, we like that British comedy. British comedy is very fast, you really have to listen
A|Uh, oh.
B|I mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out,
A|Right.
B|Right.
A|Um. But I guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.
B|I know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there.
A|Yeah
B|Well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia
A|You don't like it?
B|Yeah, I mean, uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness. Literally.
A|Our anger is going to have to, to give rise to, to more activity on our part.
B|I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.
A|So, you don't have anything right now?
B|I just don't like the cold.
A|Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?
B|Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched.
A|No.
B|And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.
A|Everyday?
B|Great.
A|you know what I mean?
B|Oh, pardon me, we have forty, we gave ten to one of our children
A|Well, I I enjoy fiddling around. It's cheap entertainment.
B|Oh, I see.
A|Which is good. Yeah. But, uh, I, you know, it's funny in, in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last, I don't know, five or six years whatever it's been. Um, they have these songs on the radio. They take popular songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the Broncos and stuff.
B|See, I'm talking about, like, in, in, uh, I'm afraid I think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared. Uh, I know the institutions don't work that well, but a bad day because I all these kids through my office. I have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.
A|That would be really great.
B|I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,
A|Sure. Yeah.
B|Yeah. It's
A|Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things
B|That's true.
A|I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
B|uh, let's see, I've had gerbils, I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
A|and I thought that was, you know, very interesting and I, I would have thought of that earlier I probably would have done, you know, just like, is that, is this, is that the Mormon church, that does that?
B|Uh-huh.
A|and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
B|Uh-huh.
A|and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things, so. I don't know, I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media
B|I think it's great.
A|I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh,
B|You know, she loves everybody. And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yes.
A|Snow peas are up and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Well isn't,
B|Well a little bit, we mostly do our newspapers. We keep our newspapers, and stuff like that and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled.
A|She looks gorgeous, no she's gorgeous and she just liked having kids and she's thin and, I mean, four or more children are thin,
B|Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens. It was kind of fun.
A|Hey, oh. Well, my, well my oldest is eight and, and she's, we've, started her on piano so, uh,
B|Uh-huh, yeah.
A|Uh-huh, uh, we, we have a pretty nice recycling center, uh, in our city now and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there. They're open like two days a week and you can just take it up there and drop it off.
B|Yeah.
