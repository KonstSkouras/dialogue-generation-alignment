A|But, I do, do enjoy since the Gulf War listening to C N N radio too, as well as watching C N N on T V here at work. I don't have C N N at home. Let me turn this radio off, I'm actually at work right now believe it or not. Uh, where was I, I'm, go ahead, your, your turn.
B|So, we used to go and listen to them all the time and, my parents still do.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|that was, uh, that was, it came out a couple of years ago and I have just now gotten around to reading it. I have had it a couple years, but, uh,
A|Yeah. But, uh, we, we really like camping. I, I must say that, uh, we we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping and, uh.
B|it's not step for step.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances
A|and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah. And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
B|Yeah, right. Right. But still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.
A|so, we had to, we had to flea bath them and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.
B|Yeah. What do you, where do you like to camp? How do you like to camp?
A|It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
B|and it is, I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. It might be, I would say it's probably midsized for the area. There are some smaller, and there are, you know, several larger.
A|They don't look a thing a like,
B|I feel sorry for her.
A|Uh-huh.
B|that's been,
A|and ours start at, at, at, at eight and end at eleven, that's why we . I, I would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten.
B|Oh.
A|you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
B|Yeah, yeah,
A|And she thinks, yeah, twenty-five percent. It, it was a small school
B|Uh, you know, and, and generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion, so, uh
A|Because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers. And people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
B|okay.
A|And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. So there's one or two nights a week, we have a, on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening and we stay home that evening, all of us, and we do things together.
B|Uh-huh.
A|You think about it and it's really, I don't know. This country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country.
B|and the kids want to swing,
A|Uh-huh.
B|You're kidding.
A|I like that. And then, uh, my husband, he just, uh, subscribed to a wood, he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes.
B|Oh, well, that's nice.
A|in a lot of, well, especially in things, you pick up the paper, and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness
B|Oh, well, it's not that long ago. It was , Oh, twelve times, of the year.
A|They're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it. Now come on, let's be realistic,
B|Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
A|Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
B|Yeah, that, that Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right. Yeah, yeah.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, boy.
A|And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
B|Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um,
A|Yeah, I know.
B|It is, it's real nice.
A|Well, basically, yeah I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. I mean uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel,
B|What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well.
A|Yeah, an, and my, my kids,
B|Uh-huh.
A|and I take it so.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|So
B|Right, yeah.
A|Well, that,
B|Uh, no, I have not.
A|No. Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah. Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My accounting department will at the end of the month. I think that I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C.
B|Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley?
A|Oh, yeah?
B|and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks, the hours are good and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
A|I really, I really like the Mercedes.
B|Uh-huh.
A|and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know. So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
B|You just say, Have a good day or whatever.
A|I just don't know and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff.
B|That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.
A|And so naturally we put ourselves, we looked at our budget,
B|and it comes on with C N N in the morning.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Pardon?
A|I don't want to play strike out, you know.
B|On the grill, we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill
A|Uh-huh. Yes.
B|You know, I know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually I'm getting a call. I wonder if I could possibly take it on call waiting. Could I ask you to hold one minute?
A|You're, uh, everybody I speak to is in Texas, oh, oh, yeah, but I'm, I'm in New York and, uh, we seem, we seem to have, um, I think the AMERICAN GLADIATORS is on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well, sometimes.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Yes.
B|Well, same here. Thanks for calling.
A|Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
B|because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina.
A|Is she the oldest one?
B|and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
A|you can't get all of us.
B|Oh, that's okay.
A|Did you know that, No, really not. Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
B|So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
A|and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car, and I, I thought about that, and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it
B|Oh, really.
A|Around a thousand.
B|Yeah
A|That's right. Uh-huh, yeah. I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really, really bad. I mean you,
B|I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.
A|That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, that's good.
B|Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
A|Yeah. Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know, and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.
B|you want to buy American.
A|Uh-huh. Well, I still, all three of my daughters are married, but, I don't know, I just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. And some of them coming back home and things, you know.
B|Oh, exactly.
A|Oh.
B|Um, and I think we choose very, very carefully the, um, alternative situations that we had them in.
A|yeah, my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,
B|but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.
A|Uh-huh. That's right. That's, honestly right.
B|I know, I, you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible
A|Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
B|Oh, they did?
A|Oh, I think that's wonderful.
B|Well I have a bunch of computer journals because I'm in computer science
A|Okay, how do you feel about them?
B|Yeah, and I'm from Utah, so, I, I like, the four seasons
A|Oh, I'm so sorry. But that's good that you're going to get another one.
B|they devoured it that quickly.
A|Yeah. Yeah.
B|You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Um, I have that on my, uh, computer here and also, um, I do some work at U T D and, uh, that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software. And, um, I don't know from my own experience, um, WordPerfect is just so much better than, than Wordstar at least the version of Wordstar that I used to have. It may be improved by now but,
B|Nice talking to you.
A|Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
B|Yes.
A|Huh.
B|Yeah.
A|What do you do?
B|I couldn't either.
A|but, uh, I don't know I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime. I think everyone would, you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,  vehicle, uh,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, but how wonderful. Are you close to getting it done?
B|Well,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|What's that?
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|so they just felt absolutely awful.
