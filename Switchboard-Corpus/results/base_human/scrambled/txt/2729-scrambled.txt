A|Same thing, Yes.
B|You're supposed to what.
A|And that might be a partial solution, or something.
B|So, uh, but, uh,
A|So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
B|So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.
A|I guess you heard our our topic for today was clothing?
B|Yeah, and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
A|Uh-huh.
B|Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.
A|But, uh,
B|Yeah. Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. So that's why we call her Liberty.
A|Uh-huh. Right, they're no, the cattiness behind, right, yeah,
B|And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable. They didn't have to do much to it.
A|And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
B|Uh-huh. And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.
A|Oh.
B|And I I mow my own lawn.
A|I enjoyed speaking with you
B|No, they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot, but they make it through probably winter and spring. So,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, it gets kind of, I, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain.
A|Do you know how to spell it?
B|Okay.
A|That's very interesting.
B|Uh-huh.
A|'cause they're farmers. These,  are all farmers coming over,
B|Um.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Liked to kill me, because I it was, I didn't have that group cooperation, I did,  it by myself.
A|Uh-huh, thanks.
B|Yeah. Anyway, um, I guess it's,
A|Oh, how funny.
B|I guess I relate it to, to Japan where things are very expensive, aren't they?
A|My wife always wonders about that she says, look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time
B|Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall. It's,  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,
A|Right. I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,
B|Oh, uh-huh.
A|Yeah
B|Yes.
A|How would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home?
B|Limited.
A|Okay.
B|Yeah.
A|Australia. Yeah.
B|Oh really.
A|Yeah, so it's been good for our family.
B|The basics. Right. Yeah. That's what we do too.
A|And unless you really like, uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
B|Yeah.
A|and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put, um, really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla, um, custard. Yeah,
B|And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
A|and some of the are the overseas programs. Uh,
B|Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then?
A|Uh-huh.
B|And I'm really pleased with it.
A|Right. Course, they'd be, they would be barred, but
B|and you've a choice of where you want to go.
A|And they have been, we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.
B|I'll be right back. Excuse me,  just a moment. They're going to get mad
A|Uh.
B|And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know. He might do a good job.
A|And go out and spend it. And, um, it's just unreal. I mean, I don't like credit cards, I wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know, the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation. They would let you use it maybe once a year. You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but, um, I have seen so many people and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen. She got, uh, I can't remember what she called it, it's some kind of, maybe it's sure or something like that, it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,
B|Oh.
A|and, uh, I like those. We very seldom watch any, uh, Public Television, Channel Thirteen. Do you watch it much?
B|In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now?
A|So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
B|we tend to alternate between NEWSWEEK and TIME and whatever happens to be the, the, uh, news magazine of the year for us.
A|Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
B|And Ford and General Motors and all those compete.
A|Well, no, I don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I didn't, I mean,
B|Oh, how wonderful.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yes, yes, yes.
A|Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
B|Oh, you must live in this area.
A|Uh, that God because, *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
B|Uh-huh. Right.
A|Oh, you are?
B|Uh-huh.
A|But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
B|. Yeah. I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures,  them.
A|and I'm, I, that's fine with me. my fiancee and I both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever. If You know what I mean? We feel like, it's our responsibility,
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, right. I'll take anything you know.
B|Yours is a slab I assume.
A|they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to doing it. I keep saying we need to have one. They go, okay, then start one. But everybody wants to do it but, you know, God's sitting on my heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, but anyway, so they could really only have four members on the team. I think they only have four boys . I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
B|Okay, yeah, it sounds good.
A|Yeah.
B|Right. And, uh, I don't know, I've, I've always thought that any, uh, crime that, uh, that, uh, intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where I think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps, uh, doing it again, and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that, you know, there's a, a very steep penalty to, uh, be paid when that's done,
A|Oh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.
B|but that's just how it is. My mother was complaining last year about you know, it's dwindling down every year, you know, that's just, I think that's just
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I suppose you could use that.
B|The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done. It's twenty years old, I think.
A|No, a five speed. And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
B|and people like Charles Manson, and, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now, now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes. The people who were there originally, when they, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are still in there for, are in prison, in quote, for life, and, and are now coming up for parole, some of them, like Manson who's come up you know
A|Yeah.
B|Okay.
A|Yeah. I was just going to say.
B|Well, good luck to you. I enjoyed it.
A|but we could find one.
B|No kidding.
A|Oh, that's great.
B|Oh, well, still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Well, it's very true, now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth.
A|Yeah.
B|Yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. When you start seeing what all they can do for you.
A|Right. What about tomatoes, aren't they pretty hardy?
B|And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
A|Right, as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love. They just give it, and don't expect too much.
B|Uh-huh.
A|So, that's it that's okay, my, that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation,
B|Uh-huh.
A|And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it, it ends up burning, I mean, no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
B|I can I can just do it
A|Uh-huh, and it just pertained to that
B|Right. If, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?
A|Oh.
B|and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful, they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.
A|And, uh, you know, and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders, they, uh, been in jail before
B|Okay. Yeah.
A|Well, let's hope not. You can be, uh, get in trouble for that.
B|Right. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away,  at, at this point
A|Uh huh.
B|You can give me seventies
A|Okay.
B|Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure.
A|Well, they say, I think I, um, have read recently that, uh, the Bush Administration has increased the funding for the Peace Corps.
B|and they charge me all these others, and it's just too expensive.
A|Yeah. They did. I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before. We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other, we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.
B|Oh, yeah, that's neat.
A|Okay. Thanks a lot, and you have a good day.
B|Huh.
A|Yeah.
B|Are you having any trouble with bugs in, in your garden?
