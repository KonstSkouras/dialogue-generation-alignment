A|No, no, I haven't. Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition. So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.
B|Yeah. This cave that we used to go in was little, it was small it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out.
A|No.
B|You don't have to shift So you, cars become very simple all  of a sudden too.
A|Yeah. Yes. No.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Sevren is east, near the eastern shore,
A|so, It was, it was a pleasant time.
B|Uh, yeah a little bit. Uh, uh of course in the summer if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts and that's it. Run around barefoot, no shirt or anything But, uh,
A|Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
B|It's, it's amazing, they either have one or none.
A|Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and, and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems. So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.
B|Uh-huh.
A|but they, at, at the T I there, I said is there any area I should avoid. And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself, or anything. And she, she thought for a few minutes and she said, no. And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. She said, no. And they said, it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
B|Right. If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together.
A|So, maybe you would,
B|That's wonderful. There's a lot out there to see,
A|Uh,
B|Oh, yeah. Yeah, I enjoy it. I come home from work and, and I usually say hello to wife and kids, and then go out and fiddle, you know, just walk around the yard and inspect it
A|Oh, yeah, if you if you can, yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, yeah. It comes and goes.
B|So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material. Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
A|and now I, I've lost my excuse for that so I have to for the last couple of years I've done it myself.
B|It's, uh, pretty nice. Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
A|Yep.
B|Yep. Oh
A|Yeah well you can possess 'em here too but They have to be they're registered and Uh, like uh the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here, in gun control avenues,
B|Oh, gee.
A|Yeah. We tried to find them last year, we screwed around and waited too long and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
B|You know like people that are in prison, I mean we didn't put them there. They put themselves in that situation.
A|Uh-huh.
B|and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
A|But what, I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like
B|And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know. It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes
A|Yes, I live in northwest Garland. Right up there near the golf course.
B|Yeah.
A|Well, the only, uh, references that I have seen lately has been, uh, in, part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things, and, and they made references to in the past, how we have given arms to, uh, Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America, and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|But, uh, if everyone would take it, I think if everyone took it seriously
A|Uh, as a course for P E you know so I could graduate.
B|Yeah, there are. Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
A|Okay. What, uh, go ahead and tell me about your home
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Really? Well, that's a good deal.
B|I sort of worked half time. I had very flexible hours. I nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and I,  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things I preach all the time to, to mothers.
A|That's a good idea. We ought to, Yeah, and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, I don't know what they're going to do. It's really not my family. It's my fiancee's so I don't, I can't say much.
B|Right, he's supposed to be able to do that.
A|and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah. Yeah. Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
B|Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels,  Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat.
A|Uh, Uh, University of Southern Mississippi.
B|Well, they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
A|It's not unique,
B|You know, once they, they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt, these people are guilty.
A|Oh. Well, I tell you this, the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, you know, and when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, you know, there's snow and it's an adventure And here, yeah you've just got to drive down to the, to the stadium
B|and I was disappointed when I went to Texas. I didn't see that many of them.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
A|and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator and I think about all the people that he talks to all over the,
B|Oh.
A|isn't that correct.
B|a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order.
A|Haven't been there, I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and,
B|So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.
A|and, and we really don't have any that don't have the Social Security and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, can you believe it, that's just, uh,
B|Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?
A|Yeah. Yeah.
B|I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
A|I didn't know.
B|I can't remember which. I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got.
A|You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often, and that must be the thing. They really hadn't either. They went to the Memorial, you know, when they go, it's on business
B|They are beautiful homes.
A|So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
B|Yeah, it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
A|and they came from the same litter and everything.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh yeah, yeah. We did a lot of different things. We'd stop when we wanted to, that kind of stuff. So, we kind of did a little bit of hiking, sure, and a little bit of, uh, sightseeing, uh, different areas. Uh, sitting back at different areas and spending hours, we never had really a time limit, we just kind of did what we wanted to do for that day.
B|Yeah.
A|um, but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,
B|Yeah.
A|Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
B|Right. Right. I, I, it seems like they come in spurts.
A|Let's see, a good dinner party menu.
B|So, it's pretty interesting work so,
A|Just a moment Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.
B|You know what I miss though? Basements.
A|that's uh that's
B|Okay, Bye.
A|and each, uh, home does participate but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything. And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah. No, that's true. Course they have a requirement that, uh, that every single appeal must be permitted.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh. That's great.
A|Where there's a will,  where there's a will, there's a way, right?
B|Okay.
A|It would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.
B|that's MAJOR DAD at eight I think it is.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Think about, uh, taxes.
B|Right.
A|Yeah, um, something I do is a fruit, is, I'll get, um, make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them. Yeah, I have two nieces and they, they they go melt some chocolate chips, Go buy me some strawberries.
B|Yeah, my truck's broken down and my house just burned down, you know.
A|Oh, yeah.
B|I used to go with my brother.
A|But,
B|Uh-huh.
A|More, more, I can understand that, that's probably what I would, uh,
B|Uh-huh.
