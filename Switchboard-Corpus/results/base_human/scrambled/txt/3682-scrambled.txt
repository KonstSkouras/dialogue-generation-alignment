A|Yes, I read about that
B|Really.
A|Uh,
B|I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh, I'm with the university actually
A|Yes. Right. Oh, great.
B|Oh, how fun.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, in their own community, right. Yeah, that's true Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
A|I mean,
B|Oh, I see. Yeah. I see.
A|Do you have a lawn?
B|So.
A|Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,  so that's what they get to cook.
B|Oh.
A|And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
B|Uh-huh.
A|So ugly she's cute, right.
B|Yeah.
A|Right. Yeah, my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,
B|so they, they take their family.
A|Can I put you on hold for one minute?
B|Yeah, yes. So where have you been?
A|Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it
B|and, and that should be first and, and children second. But they don't have kind of an, what we call an internal perspective of things.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Tablets?
A|Uh-huh. Right, right.
B|Uh, he's, uh, up in, Huh?
A|Okay. Uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, I'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad. Uh, probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have.
B|Well, that, and the, and the economy is so bad and, And so many people have been laid off and stuff.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be done, and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside, but, uh,
A|It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
B|And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
A|Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.
B|Gosh. That's great. That's a lot.
A|Oh,
B|and, uh, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare.
A|Well, my favorite type of music is classical music, and, uh, I, I enjoy orchestral classical music and I enjoy classical guitar and classical piano, you know, and that's, those are, that's my favorite type.
B|Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh
A|That's like me.
B|I.
A|Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to Atchafalaya.
A|Uh-huh. They live lean for one thing and they tithe and they it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole we don't honor God with this portion and so they, I think that helps a lot. I think that's the key, in he, like his sales last year he just works a normal job. He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand, but last year he made that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van. He loves God, I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
B|I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?" "Yeah, but I'm, you know, it's too much trouble." So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family. And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano, but he can't learn like that. He's a delayed child. He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah.
B|and, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time, I lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting and I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|Yeah. I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York,
A|and I, uh, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because I tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
B|so, that's not a good way to
A|Uh-huh. Right, right. Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right. I, I teach swim lessons a lot, and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know, kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.
B|I am a speech pathology major and so I do a lot of clinical work and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh, uh, look my best.
A|Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
B|Um.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right. Well, I put,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh. Was it very expensive?
A|Yeah this is, it's like a duplex, like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
B|I think maybe you look at, uh, the age of the person and their station in life and, and, uh, how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up, you know, with, with that. I mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old.
A|Right.
B|Well, I sure need them. Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them.
A|I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, you know, until I retired
B|Yeah. Uh-huh.
A|Yeah. Um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs?
B|Uh-huh.
A|And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work
B|Um, now I didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.
A|Uh-huh, so.
B|Oh, no.
A|Sure.
B|I just don't understand why they, so much want to just stay in  that building.
A|Oh.
B|Yeah. Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.
A|Uh, there is a lot, you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
B|and I think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
B|Do do you put it in the refrigerator then or
A|Like I say it's just,
B|Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
A|Yeah, when I had a Cocker Spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog and, uh, I think I liked that better.
B|and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do
A|I, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,
B|Uh-huh.
A|so we're considering Pennsylvania, and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
B|Absolutely.
A|And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
B|and,
A|Oh.
B|Well, there is so much about it to like.
A|Bye-bye.
B|Yes, it's nothing to be proud of, certainly not.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Ours is not a working farm
A|It depends on, you can really vary it.
B|Yeah.
A|Nancy, that's right,
B|Very frustrating. Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. You come here with the B level of specs?
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, I know, and that's, you know, like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
B|And, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but, There's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.
A|If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, I don't think I would have insurance, uh, other,
B|Well, they it, the, their, they do have an extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example. It has one of the best school systems in the country.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.
A|and I did it, um, for one reason I wanted, I was working on a masters degree so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
B|Oh, I see. How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?
B|So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time and,
