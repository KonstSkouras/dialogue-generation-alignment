A|Right. we get,
B|Right.
A|Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
B|I a or, or foreign cars actually. Uh,
A|But, then again I originally was from California and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California. And, uh  they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line. Devil's advocate possibly, but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether or not you agree with that law, you're still circumventing it. You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.
B|Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself. That you've just got to   you've just got to
A|Yeah.
B|I used to be in Ohio, it's some pretty country up there.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. I, I, I, my schools, I mean, there, I have a lot of once, once it seemed I got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
A|Right.
B|That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, uh, Alsatian that's the other one. Alsatian, any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.
A|Uh-huh.
B|No, I don't. I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,
A|Sure, sure.
B|Uh-huh.
A|That's right, I mean, it does,  seem like we're,
B|Right.
A|Uh-huh. Right.
B|No.
A|you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this, there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate
B|Uh, I certainly can't argue with that. Definitely does need some improvements. Uh, and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to.
A|Got a problem, huh? Um,
B|but I feel closer to them, because I kind of grew up with them. But, But, uh, as, you know, for the rest of that group, no not really.
A|we have found state parks, not that they're lacking but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner. You've got the showers available. It's not, you know, in the same category. State parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different. But, so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. That's the only time you really use your campground. If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
B|Right, uh, but yes, we just, just love them to death.
A|Bang, *one utt?? bang.
B|Um.
A|Right. In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City. They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.
B|Uh-huh
A|Well, there's, uh, places in Wisconsin. There's the Apostle Islands, uh which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place.
B|It is, it really is. And I mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.
A|Yeah. Yeah, and get even with who, I mean,
B|Yeah, I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
A|like for drugs, for drugs they, they enforce the death penalty for that. Uh, they're just, very, very tough, and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too, or Japan is too. They're just very tough on criminals.
B|Right. So it's, so that's nice. It would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that, but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.
A|Uh-huh,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, right. Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress
B|I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
A|but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
B|They're cute. They look like an air headed let me tell you. They're calm, they're not yuppie , they're trainable, they're, uh, very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is. They're not dignified like a retriever can be.
A|Uh-huh.
B|and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh we, have a half bath downstairs, too.
A|That, yes. I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
B|Uh, it, it does, uh, I don't know, it, it's really more fun than anything else. As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun
A|Right, that you, Right. That's right.
B|Yeah. Now what about you, if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get
A|And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.
B|The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
A|So, um, I think that that would be a real, a real, uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, uh, do it early,
B|We only see the tip of the iceberg only.
A|Uh-huh
B|Well, I guess a lot of the, uh, something that's kind of more of a comedy. We do have, uh, cable, and we have premium stations like H B O and Showtime and such, and I guess a lot of times when I first turn the T V on, I, I normally go to those, because I pay for them
A|It might be handy,
B|Hi, well, I guess, which one have you got right now? Or,
A|Well, that's good. Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.
B|Uh, Jazz.
A|Um, hobbies, I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things, um,
B|Well, that's right. Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste
A|and we just moved here, uh, we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate, and then we were transferred back here, and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,
B|Well.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field.
A|Uh-huh. Uh, so, I, most of the kids here, I, you know, like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it, but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah, you know, you know.
B|It's just kind of, uh, we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. But really it's strange. We haven't really had an autumn. It's like we went into winter
A|Oh, gosh, Chris Xeros You grew up with his children, too, then?
B|Well, now you, you say two different parts of the country what, are, are, are you referring to yourself or,
A|Yeah, that's, that's right talk to, I had to talk about gun control with somebody and I talked with a woman who actually, you know, had just purchased a gun that day,  and was going target shooting, you know,
B|and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States. It's, uh, it's okay. I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
A|And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Right. Yeah, that would be a real good motivation for people.
B|Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
A|Physics.
B|Yeah,
A|And we just had a really big ice storm. And, basically, half the trees in, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh right upstate. Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore.
B|and, you know, there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them all at one time.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
B|Right. Uh-huh.
A|The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
B|Yes.
B|Yes, especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy. Yes.
