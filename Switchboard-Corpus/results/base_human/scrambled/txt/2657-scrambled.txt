A|Wow.
B|Yeah, yeah. Well, To some extent if they would do something with some of those people. But that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
A|Yes, yes.
B|Like last Saturday we went, had some errands to run and so we took the kids and, and went by the Farmers Market down in, in, down there in Garland.
A|My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now. She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California, and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her, and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, and, uh,
B|I I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.
A|Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
B|The kids, they are real people and they are interesting and, they, they have all their own activities and, um, I think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh yeah. It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.
A|Well, if you're looking for a nice, Uh-huh. Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
B|We do
A|and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.
B|so, it's, it's really sad
A|Oh, that's good.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right. No.
B|uh.
A|Uh-huh. Yes, they are.
B|So I wasn't sure when to start her. I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
A|Uh-huh. Right.
B|Pardon me?
A|And Spanish is,  pretty close to English, really.
B|And all the civil rights people are up arms about it, you know.
A|I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.
B|Yeah.
A|amount of people eat, *listen and then say, man this is really good,
B|I think that I would like to, if you know, we all say, if I could have the car I always wanted I would either buy a Nissan Maxima, uh,
A|Um.
B|Uh-huh. Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.
A|Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget.
B|Wild flowers.
A|Right.
B|I'm a nurse and I work,
A|Uh, not a whole lot, uh. I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
B|here you break in, and you're going to get shot.
A|That's right.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, wow. We like the stuff that glitters
A|That's what I hear.
B|so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
A|Yeah. I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people. Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
B|He,
A|Yeah. It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting.
B|You know, but I wasn't, I had forgotten or I probably wouldn't have been there.
A|So where was your last vacation?
B|I think I, think it would be fair.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure
B|Uh-huh.
A|Kalli , K A L L I? Okay.
B|Oh.
A|I don't remember if I had shrimp.
B|Uh-huh. I know.
A|Oh, neat.
B|Right. College credit is a good idea because,
A|He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical
B|Oh, yeah.
A|So,
B|Uh, there was certainly nothing like a, a bathroom, a shower or anything, near by It was dig your own hole and, uh  and I I'm not sure I'd do that  that anymore,
A|it is hard. It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
B|Uh, but,
A|Oh.
B|and so I learned that on there too, that was,
A|And I've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and, and vent their frustration with government. Like one, eight hundred capitol or something like that. You know, just a number you could call from anywhere, anytime.
B|Huh.
A|oh, yeah. I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that. But, um, I guess it's because I'm older, I mean, I'm not real old but I am older and, um, you know, I didn't feel like that I didn't feel like I had to have everything. I guess it was because, well, I had everything when I was at home but I, I don't know why I didn't.
B|Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
A|Right, research triangle and all of that.
B|Yeah. Right.
A|Uh-huh, you'd just do it.
B|And if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know, I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences, I'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know, maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right. That's right.
A|and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man, and, and at the end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh, that's nice.
B|And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, uh, brought him home,
A|Yeah.
B|How did, How did they get involved in that?
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah, uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
A|We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes, yes. And then, I'll have, just like , uh, department stores. They'll call me up, you know, and I'll say, look, I don't want the credit card, well, we're just going to send it to you, you know, you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to. They'll send me any credit card, I tear it up. I just can't see it.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, dear.
B|The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,
A|Oh.
B|And, because my daughter calls it her gravy and I mean, she thinks it's wonderful, my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to,
A|He makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
B|I, I lived in Abilene for a little while, and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant,
A|Uh-huh. Exactly. And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being, I mean it gave people jobs
B|But then, uh, we also didn't do , spend, uh, time with them trying to, trying to, uh, you know, just family time.
A|Uh, probably no.
B|You were?
A|and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.
B|Huh.
A|so.
B|and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,
A|and now, they can't find them and they're finding bodies in you know, I mean, you think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's over crowded, and you think how is, is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
