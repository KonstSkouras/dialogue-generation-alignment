A|this is gross.
B|Lots of wildlife huh? Yeah.
A|And it played by itself?
B|What did you wind up with?
A|and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
B|And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week, I, uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus So she you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon til close. Uh, so we have
A|Yeah. I don't, I, if I, you know, if I happen to find it, I'll go ahead and read it someplace, you know, if I'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that I never, I never liked that really.
B|She loves lots of windows. That's great.
A|Okay.
B|Yeah. I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean. They're not worth it
A|Oh, that will be good.
B|Uh-huh. That's right.
A|Of course, their seasons are switched.
B|Uh-huh, it really could, and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead, and they keep dragging it on, and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
A|and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
B|Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
A|Yeah.
B|My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that, and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser. I'll never forget that because I remember my brother, he came home and he counted the fish
A|and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers, and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water
B|Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
A|Yeah. But it's funny that, uh, I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania. I'm not even sure of that, but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that. And, it surprised, and even Florida, I know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
B|Uh-huh
A|We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures, and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
B|And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
A|Well,
B|Right.
A|Really.
B|Yeah, they, down here they, they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them.
A|I guess that, I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
B|And is it, um, a natural gas and,
A|Yeah, yeah.
B|In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.
A|But, um, I have, um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, I have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing. And, um, for a while I had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist. So I did some advertising and P R but,
B|Uh, Um, um, no, not really. in that, but, then again, uh, well, I, you know, I have some aunts that, uh, I, I, I do. That's about my mother's sisters, you know,
A|Well that's okay. I guess it's an easy thing to do. So you're you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?
B|Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh, for the bad times of the company.
A|And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
B|Yeah, I, I, New York does not
A|Yeah, that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
B|So K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury. That, that, that right
A|Yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
B|I exactly where she is. But, um, we met in Paris.
A|This, this friend of mine has, well it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this, they just, they had a ball romping around,
B|And
A|That, For, oh, Uh-huh.
B|But that,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh. Right, and then the family home evening, too.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, yeah, definitely.
A|Uh-huh.
B|None to cook. I don't like to cook
A|Are you ready to start?
B|Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
A|Or, you know, plead insanity.
B|Yeah, I like having cats around or pets around in general I, I favor dogs over cats actually but,
A|I used to, when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B|Okay, yeah. Well you just do,
A|and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Anyways, but, uh. Yeah, we just had a terrible case in Virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like I said, he just, uh, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.
A|Well, that's great that you all can work that out. That's really good.
B|Uh-huh.
A|The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
B|But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
A|I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq, but that,
B|Right.
A|Yeah, well, I was, I was actually in, uh, a lot of the B M W are produced in, uh, uh, Stutgardt and, uh, and Munich
B|It doesn't make sense. Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world  is corn.
A|Good-bye.
B|He's a little boy
A|Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
B|I think that starts in sixth grade.
A|Every time you, They could buy their way out.
B|But it was good. I mean it was, it, at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra. But the kids were,
A|She has twelve children.
B|Oh well that sounds like fun too
A|Yeah. I mean, and and in the, once you junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels. Well, no, I guess it in junior high, it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. Uh, which,
B|but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.
A|So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. Right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. Uh, I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
B|Well, you know
A|Yeah, the population's been really up. They've, uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, uh, increasing so much.
B|Two hours where?
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So is it, uh, are we doing lethal injection now?
B|Oh, exactly. Each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what, um, the going, you know, if you will the going, uh, award should be for a certain type of case, you know, within some kind of range.
