A|And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
B|And now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are have, uh, have died off, or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.
A|oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes. Yes. Not getting paroled, let's say in so many, years.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right. Huh. And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right?
B|Uh-huh.
A|This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, actually this fall, I was talking about, two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
B|exactly.
A|I have two boys that are boy scout age, and, uh, so I am very active in Boy Scouts
B|Uh-huh.
A|I don't believe that we're ,
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|Definitely. Well, he was a good player. I guess, well I don't know, he just never, I don't know, for a while there ,
B|Uh-huh.
A|And I don't know if they decided to do, or not, but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that. Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point,  without charging people.
B|Well, do we?
A|Yeah.
B|but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
A|and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
B|Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
A|Yeah. That's right. I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, you know,
B|I know I'm always scared of that whenever I go to a game. I rarely go but we went last year because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
A|Uh, a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know?
B|And that, that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
A|You spend what you have and, Yeah, I think that, the general idea is to you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy, but they're running under the you know, the way they're running it now, they're you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession, so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running, so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt, you're not going to payoff what you owe, but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay you know, get what you pay for.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes, yeah, we had summer lasting long and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.
B|Well, they started out really bad, they went like one and six, and then they won five or six in a row.
A|and I'm saying let's move right on
B|But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a family family thing. You know, one of those hell family vacations.
A|You feel it, don't you?
B|Probably, yeah Yeah. But, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though, that, uh, that the people, though, that you, you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
A|Uh, and, although I can't afford it right now, I would just like love to have one.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, I kind of, I haven't been keeping up with football, I mean, in the fall I, I can go on and on about football, but since it's kind of off season, it's kind of hard to think back about all that. But, uh,
B|The, the penalty phase, yeah, they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.
A|Wow.
B|uh,
A|They do. Well, it was very good it just takes up, you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area.
B|Oh.
A|uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal. Singapore is very, supposed to be very safe and, in fact, Tokyo, and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
B|Yeah. And she still likes to get TIME which I've never liked very much
A|Uh, but yeah, that was, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
B|They're seen as senile
A|I never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock,
B|I'm about fifteen miles out.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|You don't know what happened to GABRIEL'S FIRE then?
A|why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?
B|You do the same.
A|Sounds like a place where I grew up
B|but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids, we'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road, you know.
A|but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
B|Oh, is she still there?
A|Yeah, but, you, you think that, I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
B|Because they'll arrest someone and, you know, go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this, and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them, how you talk to them, uh, you know, what they say,
A|Because it's all geothermal.
B|Yeah. I, you know, I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program,
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
B|No.
A|Yes, and, you know, we have, uh, needs in our life that are unique to us and, uh, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
B|And, they, they, have a, you, a good appetite
A|and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,
B|Yeah.
A|Oh.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|It's, yeah, That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt? Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
B|Oh, okay.
A|You know, I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that but, um, and what else, um, I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
B|Right.
