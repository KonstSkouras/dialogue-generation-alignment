A|I see.
B|Yep.
A|and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met. Um, she's had them for a couple years. And um, you know, they're really cute, they're, they're sisters,
B|Yes it is. It's a tough, tough question. It really is. I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that. Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
A|and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
B|Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.
A|Uh-huh, wow, yeah.
B|So, I, how do you feel that it should be applied?
A|Yeah. Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Sure.
B|I can understand.
A|Yeah, yeah, I agree.
B|Okay.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
A|I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, uh, but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people,
B|At least they're coming around.
A|Material things, yes, that is, yes,
B|Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
A|Uh-huh. I see.
B|That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think.
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.
B|That's what, Oh, my goodness.
A|Thirty day notice for what?
B|Uh-huh.
A|But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
B|You, too, and I hope everything works out up there.
A|And I just, there, you know, they came from poverty, they were going to condition in poverty and it was, it was, the school district couldn't hire many people, it was very difficult for them to hire, and I think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, um, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, um, things, I think it's a really good idea. And even if it is overseas.
B|And so overbuilding is, has been a real problem there.
A|yeah.
B|No, kidding.
A|Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.
B|I guess so
A|As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?
B|I'm a summer person
A|Those are nice, aren't they? Yes, those are nice.
B|Uh, that's where the family grew.
A|Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will
B|Uh-huh
A|Huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
B|and I push them on swing.
A|And yeah, I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, so.
B|Yeah.
A|he's just there to serve his time, and get back out on the street.
B|I really don't know that much about it, you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when,
A|Oh, you do, okay, yeah. I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
B|You go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience, get them all in the auditorium,
A|It is inside and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
B|What I really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that I do have still, that they send you these things that look like checks,
A|that's still fairly new.
B|Uh, and we take the, the, uh, civil liberties, uh, stuff too far.
A|yeah.
B|Eye care is good. I do not, I am not I do not think we have that on our policy.
A|Yeah. Well, we had growing up I guess I can talk about us. We had nine kids in our family. We had eight boys and one girl. But, my Dad, uh,
B|I just want to,
A|Right.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.
B|Yeah, escape. But it's beautiful, it's, you know, it's Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest, there are a lot of pine trees, but it's mostly oaks and .
A|Uh-huh.
B|and, uh,
A|and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh you know, the, the forty-five to the head, you know, just the, the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh, you know, the guy only got five years.
B|For one person?
A|It's not a program to teach them to use the American money, it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant.
B|it's about, uh, well, I, I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach, I work in Rome, uh,
A|Uh-huh.
B|I have ambivalent feelings because I don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is. But, on the other hand, it is very, very expensive to maintain, you know, Texas has one of biggest criminal justice systems in the country.
A|Detroit?
B|Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
A|Sure. Uh-huh.
B|We rent a pavilion and, and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good. And, uh, they will rent a pavilion on a weekend, and uh
A|She lives in Garland and I'm not sure where, what she does. But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
B|Gosh.
A|They're on the increase in this area.
