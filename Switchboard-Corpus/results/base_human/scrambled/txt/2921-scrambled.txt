A|Up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,
B|Uh-huh.
A|What do you use it for?
B|Yeah. Uh, like September was hot and dry, October.
A|That, that kind of gripes on me some, but, but I don't know.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, is that right?
B|Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
A|Oh, now come on, no Texas Rangers?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah, yep,
A|Oh, they do, too. And they're impossible to crush. I mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know. If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily, so. You know,
B|Right.
A|I don't know how Americans are about handguns but, uh, yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to accept the bill to access, to access handguns and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
B|Uh-huh.
A|I think he's dead now, but he plays wonderfully.
B|But I, I usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff.
A|And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed. Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
B|You know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, uh, rollers or anything. It seems like a really good answer to portable music, that you can choose.
A|Yeah.
B|We're in Sherman.
A|Oh, yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yes.
B|Uh, the Nissan came and, and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the CONSUMER REPORTS said we should get.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and, and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
B|Oh.
A|and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes, uh, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow-through with that.
B|Yeah, she only taught there one year but I,
A|No, I have no idea. I don't think, I don't think that was on A B C, anyway I don't know what happened to it though.
B|Yes, I understand.
A|Well, listen, uh, I think I've, I've exhausted my, uh, self on, at least I've blown off steam of the way I feel about it.
B|Uh, almost an addition, uh, and, and, and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in, in unhooking, uncoupling from the events, and going on with their. So,
A|So, well, I don't know that's my, my great hard recipe.
B|Yeah, he's a pretty nice guy.
A|How would you go about organizing a family reunion?
B|Um.
A|Yeah.
B|you're going to have on extra expenses for car.
A|Yeah. Yeah, I think, I mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. My dad, I think my, I'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works, but it would definitely be something to look into once I get my own.
B|And a lot of them decide just not to have children.
A|Okay, have you participated in anything like that?
B|Uh-huh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
A|You know, it's just, but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her. She's down in Temple
B|Uh ...
A|It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. The coastline was just incredible. It's huge.
B|Wow.
A|I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.
B|Uh-huh. Ooh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|So it was pretty much a physical decision?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Good point. That's a good point.
B|Uh-huh.
A|That's coming up here pretty soon. Is it this weekend?
B|I got my certification. But actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
A|So, do you think, it was overdeveloped then?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right. yeah.
B|and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
A|Oh man.
B|I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
A|Uh-huh.
B|I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
A|Yeah, I heard that. It's, it's daughter, it's his daughter that,
B|t-, whether my dentist or
A|Yeah.
B|and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
A|Dye Mound?
B|The whole family was so disappointed
A|and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
B|and, uh, that's more important than anything else. We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
A|Uh-huh.
B|And it's like I said at our expense.
A|but then it depends on who you are calling on. Who you're, you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.
B|Oh, I .
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
B|Oh, I know.
A|Right.
B|Yeah.
A|Right.
B|Well, I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business, but it's a little sideline, part time thing.
A|and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places
B|but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.
A|I,
B|and you can give me eighties
A|Huh-uh.
B|Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children. I mean it has been a real, uh, there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think, I think they have captured a certain market. Again the, but then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.
A|And I thought, you know, that really, now that I'm thirty years old, I think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the United States or outside the country, I think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.
B|And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
B|I don't know Yeah I think it was .
A|Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long.
B|Right. There for a while, that would, that worked. We've, uh, I know I have, um, I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.
A|and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Okay.
B|I really like those, in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|That's right. If I have a problem discipline, you know, I think, now, boy, I really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, that's a full time job.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, really.
B|Oh, do they?
A|Oh, I think that's great.
B|Oh, now that's neat.
A|But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
B|Well, I know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years, you know, their carefree years
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right, right, that's, uh,
B|Right. Then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something, because really, I've thought lately, there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE.
A|Everyone would appeal. That's true, too.
B|Is that, is that good? You know, I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but I've never tried it, are they really good?
A|It is, because they,
B|I think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh, and some of them are our problems, but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do.
A|I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. So it's worked pretty well. There's, I don't really think anything's been broken. Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.
B|I always, take home baked bread.
A|AIDS research is something that, that, I think whether our country is putting enough money into it
B|So, we, we rely pretty, pretty heavily, I think, on a combination of the, of the two. I also, uh, use, uh, NEWSWEEK magazine. Uh,
A|So we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did,
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Makes a lot of difference.
B|Yeah, I've, I've heard of that.
A|Oh, okay, I know where that is.
B|and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially or how does that work.
A|Yes. My son, is in both band and scouts too.
B|I rely primarily on, uh, newspaper combined with television.
A|No.
B|Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my, what I was going to study
A|Oh, yeah, all that hoedown stuff.
B|It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time. And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop
A|You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
B|Yeah, that's true.
A|Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever.
B|I'm sorry for these beeps,
A|well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah. But, I think it's about an hour.
B|You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.
A|and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
B|I'm sure that's coming though. But,  they are wonderful kids.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh So, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. Very limited space waste
A|and I love to walk, so if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and, and walk. What about you?
B|What, uh, grade is your daughter in?
A|Yeah.
B|Oh, uh-huh, yeah, and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be.
A|Yeah.
B|Oh. Okay, well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say.
A|So, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
B|Oh, okay.
A|Okay. That keeps you do you have a lot of activities with your kids?
B|huh.
A|That is odd. I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well, the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company
B|And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.
A|Okay.
B|But some of these guys just don't care,  you know. And so, uh,
A|It wasn't too much of a job,  really.
B|Right,
A|And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles and professions.
B|Huh.
A|Oh.
B|I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
A|Right. Right, well I guess that's a good point, uh,
B|They almost always get thrown right back out again, but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.
A|um, um, but it just, work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
B|Italian food
A|do you all, uh, have a budget?
B|Yeah.
A|But, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, well, we got asparagus, and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
B|Are you serious?
A|Uh-huh.
B|and I, I certainly, I, I grew up in a smaller town in Texas, and it wasn't that way when I was younger.
A|Great, Nancy.
B|Wow.
A|Yeah, I, I've heard a lot of people say that. That's for sure. Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood over the beams and things up in the attic and so that, has replaced it to some extent
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right, and people don't see that either.
B|Uh.
A|Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
B|Okay.
A|Right,
B|I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.
A|No, not really. I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.
B|Oh no.
A|Uh-huh.
B|And so it's, in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, uh, the you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know, let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
A|They pick up everything.
B|but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know, that's,
A|Yeah.
B|Exactly.
A|I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out.
