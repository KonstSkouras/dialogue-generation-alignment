A|and as a matter of fact, I've already done a second row of radishes.
B|Course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
A|Yes, uh-huh.
B|You know, to get into the economics of things, uh, because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards,  it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.
A|Uh-huh. Back when they were in Saint Louis?
B|Right. My Dad is actually, uh,
A|Well Brent, I've been, um, I kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because I thought, uh, if it, it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school.
B|What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism
A|We planted some yellow peppers this year. We've tried it, before
B|Yes, it certainly does.
A|And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department
B|Really?
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
B|Especially,
A|Yeah.
B|Right. That's, Right.
A|and that's not really beneficial, so, uh I don't have time like that
B|Oh, really?
A|Okay, so, what are, what are your views on capital punishment?
B|And I think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.
A|Yes.
B|Okay, sure,
A|Yeah.
B|Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night. We, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.
A|Okay, maybe, maybe we're all set. Okay, we'll talk for five minutes, they interrupt at the end. Um, yeah, it says what you would have for a dinner party, I just happen to plan one out for Saturday I'll tell you, what I'm going to have. Um, if I can find it.
B|Yes.
A|Right, right.
B|Right
A|Because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the, sometimes the cocoa is like, my husband really likes it thick he says, I can stick the spoon right in this.
B|And there are distinct breeds in Europe. Now what happened over here was is that people saw the, the first, um, which would actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was.
A|I'm building my own house.
B|I'm trying to because you have a, you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the T I people crazy.
A|Yeah, uh, I'm in, uh, New York.
B|I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
A|Yeah,
B|Right, that's true. I knew that.
A|And that's, you know, that's the way they wanted to do it. And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, uh, you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.
B|But they selectively culled those litters, I mean, for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master, I mean it had, it had to be of a disposition to make it, you know, an animal you could keep around that closely. But they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect. Now, you know, that seems like a cruel thing to do.
A|I think that's coming and I think once, once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change. Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful. So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved, and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.
B|Recently, my most recent trip was last year, and that was Detroit.
A|And that really helped us out a great deal. So. But my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too.
B|I don't, I don't think they should be forced, but I think they should be, I guess, encouraged to, to do some kind of public work, I guess to, just to get them, I guess involved with community maybe, you know, just community activity. If nothing else, see how the city works, stuff like that.
A|we have, you know, you can't just, just hope for abstinence.
B|Uh-huh, relaxed and laid back and stuff
A|And I thought well that's interesting, I'll call them.
B|And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have.
A|Right. And what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him?
B|Uh-huh. Oh, no.
A|Well, what kind of garden do you have?
B|So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,
A|Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
B|And they would, you know, I, I picked off like twenty of them and,
A|Uh, not too much. Uh, I got a bit. Actually,
B|Sure.
A|Yes. Right, that would be the intent of it.
B|You ever heard of that?
A|I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
B|Yeah, I would I would like to, too, because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of of where she ,
A|Well, we have it just opposite here. My wife works in, you know, at, at, at the T I, and she's, uh, sedentary all day long so when she gets home she likes to mow.
B|Yeah.
A|I have to say that.
B|Right, right.
A|Uh, I want to talk about, um, our family budget,  and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and,  give you a general description of it
B|Uh, at this point.
A|My truck is broken down.
B|Yeah
A|I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
B|So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.
A|They, they went to all, all ...
B|Uh, we have fifty acres.
A|Okay.
B|Yeah, yeah
A|Everybody says that
B|You too.
A|Oh, I bet it is, too.
B|two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling, I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there, because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been,
A|Yep, that will, that will, slow you up
B|Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.
A|so I'll tell them that and they won't, or just, you know, just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that, you know,
B|The place she works with, worked with before, um, worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home, part time,
A|That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
B|Uh-huh.
