A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah, well I never I had to work for him and I never would want to work for him. So
A|Yeah, I do too. Well, It's been good talking with you.
B|but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.
A|No, I don't think so either.
B|And so yeah, it's, uh, wouldn't have, I mean, oh, if something happens to her.
A|Right.
B|I, I can't identify them either. I just like them. I could, I know which ones come next, but I don't even know their names. Most of them I don't know their names of the song, but I, I can identify them. But I like that and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music.
A|Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly but  you know, they get lesser sentences
B|yeah, there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like, uh, Massachusetts went back,  and reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,
A|I've been fighting my weight since I was about ten years old.
B|Yeah, and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh, and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.
A|Oh. Uh-huh.
B|I know
A|Huh.
B|Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
A|I will always remember, I will tell this real quick story when I graduated from college, my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.
B|But, uh,
A|Uh-huh.
B|One that I can't find anymore which is GABRIEL'S FIRE.
A|Yes. The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,
B|Yeah, right.
A|Yeah.
B|I mean, I went up, I didn't go out there for about three days, you know, because I, and I went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem,
A|Yeah
B|Uh-huh. That's good.
A|I'm not always sitting down, and,
B|Yeah.
A|Well, you ready for New Year's Eve?
B|and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain, or, it seems they thrive when it rains, they just, really,
A|Yeah.
B|And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it. So, you know,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.
A|Okay, how's the weather been in Plano?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Huh.
B|Uh, just, uh, the distance involved and,
A|On my mother's side we've had several, not,  it's not really on a regular basis,
B|So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you
A|and, uh, return offenders have, they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood, they'll rob one house, then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
B|It's real hard to rate something like that.
A|That was really called roughing it, yeah. I, Anymore. Yeah, see
B|But, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh, somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather, but. Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,
A|But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them. Now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called Rodolfo's over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.
B|Yeah.
A|and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
