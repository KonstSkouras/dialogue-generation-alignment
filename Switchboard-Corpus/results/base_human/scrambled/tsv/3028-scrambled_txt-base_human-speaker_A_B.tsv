A:	And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in, they were all completely clean,
B:	And,
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah, I, I think that's Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Probably.
B:	Yeah. We all went to high school together and, uh, and we're still in contact with each other.
A:	So you have a child Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Taco Bueno, right, uh-huh.
B:	One year I didn't put anything on and I didn't have any problems.
A:	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg .
B:	A health food?
A:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times
B:	and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.
A:	Uh-huh. That's very expensive.
B:	Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, and that's canoeing.
A:	Yeah, that's, uh, spare time, with a child it's, kind of she's, we have, uh, we're looking for a baby-sitter so we've been out twice in in this year so far. By ourselves without the child
B:	Yeah, that's true .
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, it depends. Sure. Uh, so you don't, uh, if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?
A:	Are you a T I or,
B:	Oh I see Oh, gosh.
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh no.
A:	Yeah, that's true. Take them for walks, right. Yeah, I see all the people on, on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
B:	Right, and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,
A:	With children,
B:	Um.
A:	Worked at a camp there, and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
B:	and you say, no thanks.
A:	Yeah. Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
B:	Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.
A:	Oh, I haven't watched that very much, is that, do you like that?
B:	And I have I B M clones in both cases.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell. He, he's living now up, uh, in, in Maryland but, uh, he, lived in Grapevine for a long time.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
A:	Kind of like the cowboys, huh.
B:	No more, huh.
A:	They say we, we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
B:	I guess. But we're going to try that, and see how that works.
A:	Uh, I guess my feelings are that, uh, we almost have a universal health care system, uh, to a great degree, except that now I read where we've left out about thirty-four million people.
B:	I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right. Right. Oh, definitely motherhood is devalued in this society. If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's like what a waste. People think, you know, you should be fulfilling yourself
A:	Really?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay, Jerry, I guess tonight's topic is about recycling.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Oh, that's how they do it.
B:	someone in the What's the name of that restaurant? in the background Where at? . someone in the background The Hari Krishna. in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's . Kalachandji's. It's all vegetarian, and it, it was just fabulous. I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
A:	Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference. Right now,  I don't see it making a difference.
B:	Okay, uh.
A:	I know, two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
B:	but, uh, we feel real fortunate and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace. I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg.
A:	Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
B:	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
A:	North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I think so, it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,
A:	do you ever watch that?
B:	Yeah. Right, and especially if you have a family.
A:	Yes. Yes, and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside, and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine, but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,
B:	and, uh, then after that, I, my sister lives in Turkey, so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.
A:	And it was just, uh, amazing to me, and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,  and being rearrested an.
B:	Physics.
A:	and that went over real well,
B:	It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.
A:	And as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is. You know, I, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that.
B:	But,
A:	Yeah, that cocoa, yeah, the unsweetened. It comes in like a real dark can,
B:	Um, I'm twenty.
A:	That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, we all used to,
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
A:	but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.
B:	We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not so,
A:	And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I don't know what it's like now, I haven't been back up there in awhile.
A:	I know, I do too, I, most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like, you know, that's really why God and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't, I had my tubes tied so you,
B:	Yeah, but at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far I couldn't do it.
A:	And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids
B:	Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
A:	True.
B:	You're still trying to dry out?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I used to know as a Boy Scout but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.
A:	Bye
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	How old are they?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, right. That's okay. Well, we've got, um, this town house is pretty big. It's about eighteen hundred square feet. It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
B:	I thought that was on the upswing again now.
A:	okay.
B:	Yeah I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money or, what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people, I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,
A:	And I'm kind of like, yeah. I shall, they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. That was going to use it for good, so,
B:	Mine's broke at the moment, but
A:	But yes, we're into baseball, and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. We even have peewee basketball here. So there's always something.
B:	Right.
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah, I agree, I, I've, I have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person. And, uh, as far as, uh, you know there are some, some other crimes that I think, uh, you know, uh, kidnapping, um, you know, when they, I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,
B:	Yes, uh-huh, that's it
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. So they're pretty good kids, huh?
B:	Would you then go hiking. I mean would the camping be part of a long hike?
A:	That's right. I'm, I'm kind of bad about that.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
B:	I don't know.
A:	Uh, I believe in it, too
B:	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.
A:	Really? I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but, um, I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers. I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground and that, um, yeah , I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system, and, uh, the radio's kind of cruel, I mean, think, the, he, this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground, I mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man. I don't care if you're President.
B:	Um, actually I have, um, I've, I've been in them but, um, just visiting and, uh, we used to when we were like in, in our teen ages we'd go on Sundays and visit, you know, the older people. But, um, I have an elderly grandma that lives with us.
A:	It's very easy to.
B:	No, I'm not.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person
A:	Huh.
B:	Statistically, that's true.
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
