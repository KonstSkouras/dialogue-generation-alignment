A:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh.
A:	Yeah. You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another. I've never seriously ran into someone, I mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life. Uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
B:	right, we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. Or but naturally, no, it was even Mennonite related, I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
A:	Yeah, well, it didn't hurt you, did it, to, I mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Oh, I have. I've, I've, I watched that late, um, I guess it's on late Saturday nights or something,
B:	And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. I'd like to get one of these little small ones, that you see in all these gardening magazines.
A:	Oh, well, yeah
B:	Well, yeah, when it finally came down to it, um, she just got to the point after the, I mean, it wasn't a very, um, strong stroke. It was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, uh, deal I hate to see.
B:	Yeah, we have, we have two children that live in Pittsburgh
A:	I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know, a super do salary of any kind.
B:	Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But I am going to, to, uh, hopefully next year get to go back, cause, uh, a lot of the family has not, uh, on her side, my mother's side, has not seen, you know, my daughter, so
A:	that's kind of like where we're,
B:	Uh, uh.
A:	Yeah, I think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility.
B:	No. Usually busy fighting for survival.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.
A:	And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
A:	Uh. Uh-huh.
B:	I like doing that kind of stuff.
A:	There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, you know, they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats. And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards. It was so funny.
B:	I, I like the idea that, uh, if someone is from a foreign country, and they come to this country and uh, commit, a crime, I think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything, they should be immediately deported.
A:	Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served? Uh, that's a good point.
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
A:	And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.
B:	Oh, definitely.
A:	and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else so that,
B:	Even if, if they're even in that long. Or they appeal, and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something.
A:	Okay, take care.
B:	They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.
A:	It, it sounds like, I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
B:	I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.
A:	You're in Plano also, huh?
B:	And the Cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys, and the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season, and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys, so.
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
B:	And, that was the sort of thing that I would say is the best MUMBLEx and not news
A:	Sure. Okay.
B:	That's rather interesting.
A:	Right.
B:	I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.
A:	Uh I think that's what's made democracy
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I put it in a nice glass bowl and, um, some people don't like that, that, film on the pudding so you can put, uh, Saran Wrap over the top.
B:	Uh, I think, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, should, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh?
B:	Well, it, it sure seems to save lives and
A:	I, I think that would be, I am sure there is something out there, uh, ,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
A:	Yeah, I mean it, it was really exciting, growing up when, when the Cowboys were really big. Because my parents would always have season tickets, and they'd go to all the games, and you know, the hype were just unbelievable. It's just, you know, the last, oh I guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really, but, you know, I'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys, and, you know, Super Bowl, and all this other stuff. So, I can't, you know, I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. I mean, I think they'll pull out of it, and, you know, they'll, they'll wind up being good again. They've got some, lot of really good young players that are going to, that are going to, uh, do pretty good, I think. But, they're raising prices on their tickets. So they're banking on doing good next season. I think tickets are,
B:	But, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?
A:	You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah that would be a good idea.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh. I mean, I, I tend to agree with you. I think, uh, what I would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. Uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.
A:	Okay, the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate, or how they differ today than they were ten, fifteen or thirty years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right, that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I can imagine, my lord.
A:	Yeah, yeah. That's another thing. You have to go to different places to do that.
B:	And, uh, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that, that part. You know because to me where we live out here in the north east, it, it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I had a cat, I've had several cats. My pet, uh, was hit by a car New Year's Eve, but, uh,
A:	Bye.
B:	Um, well, the, see, uh, well, we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
A:	first one, you know how that is. And, um, uh, I play the guitar and a banjo. I mainly play the guitar a lot, I play about every night. And, um, I really love that, if I had a druther , if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something, because that's, I've,
B:	Yeah. And don't they go into other countries and stuff?
A:	That's it.
B:	Um. Okay, and did,
A:	Um, are you working right now?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, so that was, that was one reason why I never considered it but now that I'm further along, and I'm still paying these college loans, I, I think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because I had them delayed because I'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. And are they tested random?
A:	Um.
B:	And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things.
A:	that was, that was a big thing with him.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Where do you play golf in this area?
B:	You do the same.
A:	Not this past fall but I mean fall, a few years, I mean, it it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty-five,
B:	Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Crazy. Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?
A:	in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street.
B:	it's,
A:	Uh, probably the favorite instrument would be, uh, the violin.
B:	Yeah, if they really can, um, I think the the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.
A:	Yeah. Yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.
B:	W R R and the Oasis are the two that I listen to, more than anything else.
B:	So,
