A:	Well, white paper's bad too. They, they treat it, too.
B:	That's right
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like, unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth. You're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits. So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that.
A:	Oh, yeah? What kind of programs do you,
B:	Oh.
A:	Oh, yeah. Well, sure it does. That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.
B:	How about you, do you have any children?
A:	and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, but yeah, it, it's interesting, and I enjoy gardening. My son does the mowing of the grass.
B:	So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective. Uh, you know, their major interest is in commissions and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines. Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is and it gives you a different perspective on what people do.
A:	And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?
B:	Wow. Boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time
A:	That's neat. Yeah, she married and they have twelve children.
B:	yeah.
A:	Um.
B:	It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Sharon, Pennsylvania's up there.
A:	Well, we have this philosophy, we use it when we go off somewhere but we pay for it as soon as we come back, you know, as soon as we get our bills, we pay it off.
B:	And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't have any opinion.
A:	Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
B:	and, uh, you might, you might get a little more thorough, uh, account of something, but really, um, I don't know. So I get most of mine from television
A:	I never have either, but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just the opposite They say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. And, uh, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to, to air, and all that.
B:	and I just, sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
A:	Yes. Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	you all equated the family reunions as,  with the Protestant.
B:	No, I have not seen it. But it's, but it is, it is real interesting,
A:	So the first, you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, so
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then they get out.
B:	That's, a lot of money that you went to buy this item.
A:	I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path.
B:	We just lived up there.
A:	I've been called several times, and I push in, pushed in my number, they kept saying you have the invalid code
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is it really?
B:	Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off.
A:	and I'm not near nursing home age.
B:	I work and go to school and it's kind of nice you come home your, your pet's there for you and wants a little food a little attention.
A:	but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.
B:	Yeah. Right.
A:	Oh how funny, I can imagine. Yeah, I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh, my.
A:	And Lord knows what happened to him. He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
B:	Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.
A:	Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
B:	Oh, yeah. Well you can teach them
A:	Well, they would probably never make it then because I don't think, uh, I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.
B:	I don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
A:	Oh, yeah. Um.
B:	Exactly.
A:	You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting. But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair, and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it. I I'll tell you one quick, uh, one thing very interesting. C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.
B:	"And I asked him, I got to talking to him, I said, well, how is his nephew doing. ""Well, I don't know, I haven't,  talked to my brother in three years."" I said , ""Well, how's your brother doing?"" ""I don't know."" Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think, but I don't."
A:	And we have about ten acres, and she tries to mow about half of it
B:	Yeah. Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.
A:	But there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax. that's about, five percent right there
