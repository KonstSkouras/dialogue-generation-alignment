A:	Yeah. Probably our family room is the, the biggest. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Three and a two year old.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, probably, I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid, in fact,
B:	Yeah.
A:	I found that out. I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,
B:	What is it about, nursing homes?
A:	Well, we haven't really heard that much in the news lately, about, uh, U S involvement in Latin America, since, uh, all this Middle East crisis began. So I haven't really paid that much attention like, since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on, uh, Iraq, and, the, so the last thing that I remember hearing that much about is the Iran Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency. Can you think of anything else that's happened recently?
B:	And I mean, I think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands. And that innocent people,
A:	Oh people,
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Exactly.
B:	Are you for it?
A:	Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
B:	Hello Chuck.
A:	Good. Should we, uh, start this so we can,
B:	I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh. They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
B:	Uh yeah
A:	it's a four bedroom home It has about, I guess, eighteen hundred square feet It's on one floor
B:	I like it better, I think.
A:	I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can
B:	You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the he can't hear me. I, I don't remember how many people, but, it's, it's got men and women and it's not, it's, it's nice, I mean it's pleasant, you know, music. It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything.
A:	Yeah. Uh, but, um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, uh, um, men waiters.
B:	Yeah.
A:	and we have to pay that price, but, uh, I don't know, I don't know. It's interesting, and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,
B:	had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly, and he gave me four choices of cars to buy
A:	I mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops so I do. Now, I think, um, basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?
B:	and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh, well you,
B:	I would have thought ,
A:	Oh I know it's like the end of the world.
B:	But, uh, Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.
A:	Uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
B:	Oh, I didn't, I didn't quite hear all of it.
A:	And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires. You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. Uh,
B:	I think so too. I'm in Texas
A:	And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
B:	Yeah, just a little bit
A:	Yeah, I think, um, this is a tough subject because, uh, when you come from two different parts of the country, uh, the political views are really different. I, uh, I, I guess I've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues,
B:	and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working and I, I go back and I've got new ideas, but still .
A:	so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,
B:	They kind of guided you.
A:	Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
B:	Yeah.
A:	They're about, oh, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand
B:	Right. Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, yeah, a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.
A:	and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
B:	No, I did not. I,
A:	Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	No, no, I haven't.
B:	Like you take Asian countries, or, uh, the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground,
A:	That don't, it , it, it seems like, I mean, if wrestling is prime time, professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a wrestling to me, I don't, I don't see any difference though,
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	And they don't look at it so much as, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.
B:	uh, they can't use, like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
A:	Huh. No
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It wasn't that long that I was that young.
A:	What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?
B:	Bye.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. They do list, um, you know, list the fat,
B:	So,
A:	Right. Right. Um
B:	And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together, and they come as far away from California, and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
A:	I see.
B:	This is what's going to happen.
A:	Yeah, with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and, uh, you know, the, the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and, and how come everybody is a lawyer, you know, you know
B:	Oh, wow.
A:	Okay, well, there's, uh, it's kind of an interesting topic and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh, not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know, you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World, and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned, and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period. We're also have a very humongous trade deficit, and, uh, and that's kind of frightening. Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life, and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime, and so I think, uh, you know, things, there's been an awful lot of social change lately, and and, uh.
B:	And, uh, I don't know, a lot of younger people, you know, into more violent crimes.
A:	It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,
B:	They're real good, but they do come on kind of late, but we really do enjoy those. Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
