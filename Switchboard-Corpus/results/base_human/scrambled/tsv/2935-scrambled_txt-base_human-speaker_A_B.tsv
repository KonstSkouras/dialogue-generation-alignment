A:	and were officially, yeah, and we're officially in a state of emergency. Funny thing is the news, the national news how they covered it. Uh,
B:	and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff, so I'm used to pieces and, and I played classical flute, I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, so. I I can relate to it, I suppose But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too, because I like Chicago
A:	Sure does. That's wonderful.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
A:	It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.
B:	But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	It's like, well, I can't really give you a recipe, uh
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
B:	Yeah, it really does.
A:	You have the seven day waiting period.
B:	I'd, I'd have to say I haven't either.
A:	Uh-huh. Health food, uh, restaurants that,
B:	But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or Japanese?
A:	And so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band.
B:	So they found a, a place nearby that they put her in last year.
A:	do you?
B:	and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving
A:	They are a handful.
B:	No, I, not that I'm aware of.
A:	I wonder now in, and I've been out of school too long to answer this, but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
B:	Well let me ask you this then.
A:	I said so do I, I forgot about jazz
B:	and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
A:	It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic we just do, oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
B:	Well, we've been here since sixty-six.
A:	Yeah and how Yeah how it'll sway from one one extreme to another.
B:	My tax bracket is, is pretty high up there. I pay the, I generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
A:	Yeah. Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect? Or,
B:	Yes.
A:	Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
B:	and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
A:	I don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. I really, don't know.
B:	Um, I, I, I think we pay too much. And I've, I look at my paycheck and I make, well, let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes
A:	I can believe that. Well, it's, it's been interesting.
B:	or,
A:	and how, you're in,  Rome, New York,
B:	My husband is a physician, so, uh, I, I I talk to parents about this a lot. But children, I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, um, need very early to come to grips with any guilt,  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order. And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person. You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
B:	Wow.
A:	Huh.
B:	Yeah, you think, well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money.
A:	Yeah.
B:	A electric car it's on demand. I mean it's either on or off.
A:	And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed. We do a lot of traveling around. We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
B:	Um. Wow.
A:	Exactly. Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. For some reason I was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, it's very difficult I know.
A:	.
B:	and, uh, I was up there last weekend, and there are trees that, that still have their leaves on, and they're green, but they're dead You know, the, the freeze just got them. They, they weren't ready for it at all apparently, and, and we haven't had a typical fall at all. Not much color, you know, changes have occurred at all. Really weird this year. I'm not sure what that, what that means.
A:	I mean you can just sit, you know those little booklets that come along with it
B:	And then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
A:	Okay. So we're in Garland.
B:	Uh, no, not actually
A:	But not all country. I don't like that, when they start,
B:	Uh, I guess, I, uh, I like to play golf.
A:	Did you?
B:	Well, she was almost ridiculous. Like she'd eat ice cream and cookies. She'd,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's , yeah,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think maybe a year would be, the longest.
A:	Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County .
B:	It was bred out of several different retrievers, and they bred it for companionship and, uh, uh, disposition and, and ability to hunt. It was kept only by kings.
A:	and it's really a, a blast. My wife hates it, but that's the way life is, I guess.
B:	so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others, uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.
A:	Well, it's really fun. Um, one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it, and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
B:	Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.
A:	Right. Right. Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,
