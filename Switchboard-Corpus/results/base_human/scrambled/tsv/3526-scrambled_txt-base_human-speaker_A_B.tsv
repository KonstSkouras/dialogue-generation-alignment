A:	Oh, really.
B:	Hello?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Can you stand up in it?
A:	Uh-huh. Well, how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow? I wonder if that's possible? I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
B:	and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.
A:	Sure.
B:	So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and, and what not. Plus my parents are, well, especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and I both, to a lot of it. So,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Flower Mound, yeah. So, we're a little you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. That, that seems to make sense but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the, uh, kind of the rate for different .
B:	Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
A:	Anyway, well, you have a good day.
B:	Well I mean, you know, I think, uh, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, uh, they'll do all right.
A:	Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up I and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,  years
B:	Well, my other line is ringing
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	Oh no.
A:	Really?
B:	Well, it's kind of, hilly, but, it's, you know, low hills, it's not, uh,
A:	It's really kind of fun.
B:	And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping. And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and I told him,
A:	I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
B:	but they, they were so destitute and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,
A:	Ooh, that would be nice.
B:	Uh-huh. Sometimes we'll have, uh, we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	we're just so much wealthier, and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,
A:	I do have friends who have tried to do more,  social work,   you know, by explaining to people how the language,  and what the problems learning English might be and such.
B:	Oh, is that right?
A:	There are, there are. It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah.
B:	Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	it's a hard question, you look at the United States, we have the largest murder rate of any developed, uh,
A:	Its
B:	And I was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh, I think the company still exists. What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off you know.
A:	They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
B:	Now when was that, when were you there?
A:	excuse me.
B:	Two?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, my, husband and I, we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired.
A:	and, So,
B:	And, uh, consequently everything is filtered through that, uh, Republican Democratic sort of, glass, almost unnecessarily
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, that's true.
B:	people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.
A:	it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and, you know, you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did. You know what I mean?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
B:	Kind of radical, I know but,
A:	I'll have to check it out. I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie, but,
B:	Well, I was just talking about any company. Uh,  let's just say a lumber manufacturing company
A:	That would be, certainly be a deterrent.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I come from a very small family. And we planned a family reunion this spring. Uh, where we are from Texas and my family is from Ohio and we met in Florida.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, the, uh, the B M W is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and, and then you go to Porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
B:	Right .
A:	Um.
B:	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
A:	So it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	that's how I keep looking at it.
B:	I'm in Plano also
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Oh, no, uh-huh. They always had a paddle in our school.
A:	Oh! like a
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made.
A:	Uh, what are you thinking about buying?
B:	I'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
A:	Okay, um, now the term personal computer, uh, I don't happen to have one at home. Um, but I do have a personal computer on my desk here.
B:	So I'm kind, yeah, I'm not sure if I really want,
A:	Where are you in relation to Sevren? are you close to Sevren?
B:	yeah, I, I think you understand what I'm getting at,
A:	Do you go back?
B:	A good weather man,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
A:	Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
B:	Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.
A:	I know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets. But they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
B:	Yeah.
