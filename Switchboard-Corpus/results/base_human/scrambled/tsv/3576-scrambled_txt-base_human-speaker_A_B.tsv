A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that, I mean, they really are over,  crowded,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
B:	but we're going to ignore it
A:	It was good talking to you.
B:	It's,   Yeah,
A:	Well, are you in the market for a new car?
B:	Wow.
A:	So many times.
B:	And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes and I'll put in there, and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person but I like it, it adds something to the chicken.
A:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't know that there's a real, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, well that's how Cleo, you know, she'd lay on her step,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um. Ooh, this is a beneficial call. I like this
A:	it's just that, I didn't, I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
B:	So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing. And, of course, I look at the economic problems in the United States right now. One of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.
A:	Yeah.
B:	They, on I think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something, there in Los Angeles, they used to have a, or, I guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected, he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything, he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, And had ended up,
A:	Definitely.
B:	And I used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
A:	And then I went to England a few years ago.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
B:	I don't know
A:	Yep.
B:	Well, uh, uh, smoking and all that stuff?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.
A:	Yeah, yeah. Me neither. And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
B:	so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.
A:	Yeah. Uh, they do that I think if you're, uh, research here then I know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and I think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that.  Pay for the classes and stuff
B:	and so they say, well, this is, you know, I, I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever, but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
A:	I think that's true.
B:	What was that?
A:	Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes, and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
B:	No, I'm not that old either
A:	and then the Iranian couldn't, he didn't want them, so he gave them to Alan, and Alan and his Dad had plans that night so they gave them to us, so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian, with baseball tickets,
B:	The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.
A:	No thanks. That's right.
B:	so I don't do that. So I take it and I send, and I mail it back to them.
A:	Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
B:	Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it pays you to use it.  I mean, if you pay your bill off right away,  if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,
B:	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things. One is preventing the spread and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.
A:	Oh, I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, I remember from her checking around, she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.
A:	there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
B:	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
A:	Uh, Okay, bye-bye.
B:	And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, I think that's true, and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.
A:	Yeah, or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know. And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.
A:	I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, you can experiment on me.
B:	I, I, everything is so automated, uh, and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,
A:	And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there, they love it. But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
B:	Um, actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.
A:	Well, I'll let you go it's,
B:	I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen. It's more negative, like you said.
A:	and, uh, once you kill off a few of them
B:	Right.
