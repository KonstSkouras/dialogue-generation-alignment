A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, yeah, I think that we're too easy.
A:	And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
B:	and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Top of, top of the line.
B:	Yeah, and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right, right. Uh-huh.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Say out, instead of out you say out. Did you know that?
A:	My word isn't that sorry. That's sorry.
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah
A:	Yes. I, it just, just doesn't make sense,
B:	because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like
A:	Oh, that's great.
B:	But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
A:	You want to go first?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I sort of, I see perspectives on all sides. Um, and I've have no hope for solutions. But, uh, I do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue. I have worked with, uh, uh, a little bit with refugees from,  Southeast Asia, uh, who've come over. Uh, you know, to escape the genocide programs that are over there. And seen, you know, heard about some of the problems that they've had. And I'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be. Because I, in general, like a smaller rather than a larger population, to the land area.
B:	So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice.
A:	In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that, and it's huge over there. So I, I, you know, and it's beginning, other countries that's what's his point. This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
A:	Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
B:	it's walls and it's furniture but  there's nobody there.
A:	And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
B:	Well, I really, the last car we got was a, was a used car. I really don't prefer buying a new car. I like to let somebody else pay for that
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
A:	I think that'd be an interesting experience. But, uh, I haven't done that
B:	In the way that it's applied or it's applied at all?
A:	Oh, oh, yeah, well, um, um, it may be that, um, it was recently replaced, by actually by, um, by what may be my favorite T V show of, because sort of, uh, um, TWIN PEAKS.
B:	So I don't know, I, I, it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go.
A:	but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. So I, I think most of them are there was, it, like most areas that are built, um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from
B:	but it's comfort. Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
A:	I'm not either really.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, this man was accused of killing, uh, I think it was two people, uh, and shooting a, uh, policeman, um, point blank in the face. Of course he didn't die.
B:	Wow.
A:	there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here, and so,
B:	Right.
A:	I think you do. You feel very good after you exercise. I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
B:	Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, kind of put in a certain amount per year, *82 and 84 same utt?
A:	How about your community?
B:	And he's like oh, thank you so much.
A:	the first one I got. He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.
B:	and they get a slap on the wrist. They get, thirty days in jail
A:	I don't, I don't, I don't, I think that it should be, I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I agree with that.
A:	Huh.
B:	Yeah. Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures People, um, you know, just go on and on and on. I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care or, and it just extends with if it, what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous, you know, burden on the taxpayers. They're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. You know, who would see it.
A:	Um, thinking about it, some of the ways I try and keep up on current events is, uh, I enjoy reading the newspaper, but, uh, quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper, and so, uh, I enjoy watching some of the T V highlights and also, uh, some of the news periodicals, uh, weekly magazines, and, uh, at work I also have, uh, management summary reports that, uh, give basically a lot of the current events. Uh, how about yourself?
B:	Different set
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I spent as much on that car in twelve months as I spent for the car.
A:	There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course, but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
A:	But I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, I mean besides murder, I think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,  caught more than twice or something, uh,  it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You would still have something.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's just, so, it's a lot of work, too
B:	Yeah, it really was. I enjoyed it there. But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting, because they like to see things grow. They've done a couple of little seed projects, and so I think it would be fun for them.
A:	And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars.
B:	Well, uh, no I I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or as I would like to, uh, uh, these days. I, seems to be to easy to get busy with other things. Uh, I have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run, and every, every January and every September, I start out again and then it tapers off
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I have got some of those too, cause I love flowers
A:	Oh.
B:	All right, bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said, where were they
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, I, I was called once, but I was out of the country, and apparently I, apparently they thought I served so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it I came back and they said the record showed I served, but I was out of the country at the time, so I'm pretty sure I didn't. Uh,
B:	Are you Mormons?
A:	Uh-huh. Well, I bet you, Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yes, I mean, when I had, uh, I was watching it, the, first time I ever saw a microbiologist on there I thought well, it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities. And, uh, there she was terrific, she was really terrific.
A:	Right, you don't notice it  as much,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Than you, sure. Than it, when you were younger, uh-huh.
B:	Well now wait a minute there
