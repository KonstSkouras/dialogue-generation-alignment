A:	Yeah.
B:	When you get one way out like that but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after. Who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. If they get some of those mega awards against them.
A:	We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, that's good.
B:	Well if you're, if you're going to have a pet,  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to, you know deal with the consequences, take care of the offspring
A:	Yeah. Well, my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.
B:	Uh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Okay, well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.
B:	I know they're really proud of independence.
A:	Oh, okay.
B:	No, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right.
A:	And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
B:	Oh.
A:	True, true.
B:	And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. His parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game, and I couldn't tell you who pitched,
A:	Which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. So, I guess I'm, I'm, I'd like to see us spend more. I don't know that spending more always gets it.
B:	They're in Richardson.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I would say.
A:	Okay, well, you,
B:	No.
A:	and he reads to them,
B:	Uh-huh. Um.
A:	My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.
B:	Oh, well, that's nice. Yeah.
A:	Oh, yes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh
B:	Yes, it is.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing, where there are more than one family in a house. And with the, uh, people that are coming into the country from other countries, not knowing the language
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
A:	Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that. One thing,
B:	I do, I do microwave too, a lot
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
A:	Okay
B:	Who else is, uh, oh there's, you know, Mike , Minnesota Vikings, used to be the general manager starting the World Football League.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Right.
A:	it will be whole. You'll be able to read  off of it.
B:	I'm not sure.
A:	Right. Exactly. That's, because until, like eight,
B:	some, I don't even, I recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot, but I didn't recognize the name.
A:	You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
B:	Yeah, I'm in Texas. Where are you at?
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah. Oh. Yeah, I was up, I was up there cutting some firewood this weekend, so.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And have a good afternoon.
B:	And he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd, it was nice weather and stuff, it wasn't a real problem, but you sit there in a crowd, and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um, because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
B:	Uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. Uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,
A:	We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left. And the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home, so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.
B:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So I guess it's supposed to be dinner party, is that what they said?
A:	Uh, very good.
B:	I see him out there,
A:	Uh-huh, yeah.
B:	We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.
A:	Yes, they will.
B:	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.
A:	No, it's like, I just, I don't know, I, I just never understood why, what the attraction, I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything but I've just never seen the attraction of having fish. It's not as much fun.
B:	That's,
A:	my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum, so we can't, can't ever recycle them. I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
B:	Of course.
A:	Well actually, I play, I play the violin in, in a string quartet that often plays at weddings.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh, that was about a year and a half ago, and,
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, I have, uh, I have, uh, I have children  Boy Scout age.
B:	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
A:	are you a summer person?
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, yes, that's out near the airport. That's about forty-five miles from us.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, instead of something greasy or,
B:	They, they, that just does not go.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.
A:	He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers. Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
B:	And home porting was a possibility a few years ago.
A:	Sure. Uh-huh. Sure.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
B:	Okay.
A:	But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,
B:	Yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
A:	and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that
B:	but
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, I think they're a necessary evil. Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, uh, businesses operate on and that is, uh you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in.
A:	Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.
B:	Yes. Yes, so have we been very, very fortunate.
A:	somebody, somebody abandoned her and, she's only about, oh, between six and eight, six to eight weeks old
B:	and, um, and that's,
A:	So, it's difficult, it really is and we're all heading that way and,
B:	And the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. And then go to McDonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing, think a thing about it.
A:	Uh, okay.
B:	But not worth it.
A:	Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation. They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.
B:	There's should be, you know, this, for this crime, this is the penalty. You killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever.
A:	and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Would, it would, It would be just futile.
B:	Yeah, because we don't miss it, we really don't, when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff, so. But we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the, uh, expenses for college already, you know, eighteen years away or whatever.
A:	And, yes, you're right, I think it's a sixties program. I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he, that was his big deal.
B:	Right, it's, it's, it's just south of there.
A:	Yeah, they get out in three years on probation,
B:	Uh-huh.
