A:	I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, well, that's great, that's great.
B:	So.
A:	I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh, and I just, you know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days, I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital punishment there.
B:	On the other hand, you sure, you know, they sure created a, a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.
A:	We have it in the break area, C N N. And, but the reason I say that is on the radio they'll say and look at this, you know. And when I first heard C N N, it only started about, uh, since the war, you know, or right before that. And, they would always say and look at this, and there would be a pause, you know, would be music and stuff and I realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the, uh, the news.
B:	The police don't catch them, or the courts don't convict them, or, or they don't serve very much of the time and so, uh, you know, their, their success rate is very high. Crime does pay, you can make a good living at it.
A:	Sure. You got to inspect it, yeah.
B:	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
A:	Huh?
B:	Uh, yeah, although she is, uh, in pretty good health and she's, doesn't take any medication, it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.
A:	I, I just don't feel right so. There's lots of places if you're going to go camping. K O A are wonderful. It's kind of it's kind of the, uh, yuppie type of camping because they have showers, they have things for kids to do. They have swimming pools, things like that. If you  can find, uh, some really nice, clean, uh, campgrounds versus, uh, if you go to state parks, uh,
B:	Well, I think we're about to run out of our time.
A:	Sounds like a lot of money though
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	made me stop and think a minute about, not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.
B:	So I, I, I, you know, it is a problem. And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford. When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.
A:	Huh, well,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, it would be a good experience, and you'd be helping people, I'm sure. Very much. And and I mean, not to put, not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but I do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble. I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
B:	Yeah, I have, too. I was real skinny till I was ten.
A:	That's about my extent of, um, about baseball, I don't know, that much about it.
B:	Those milk cartons take up so much room.
A:	But, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.
B:	and the way I was brought up, and he wants me now, he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now
A:	Yeah. That's true.
B:	Right.
A:	But . That is a very good point. I am from West Virginia so I understand what you are saying there
B:	They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
A:	it when it's uh it's an emotional issue, and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing, uh but logically um even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know I don't know anybody that actually supports abortion, but they would vote pro choice.
B:	Yeah, I have a, um, my aunt's mother is, uh, gotten ill recently and, uh, she lives in Pennsylvania, they live in Alabama. And they're saying, hey, we need you to be closer and you have, women like that,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess so.
A:	There you go. Did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like you live in an isolated area or,
B:	Me, too. You guys, are you guys getting snow?
A:	Well, you, too. Good luck, uh, enjoy college while you can. Let me tell you it's, uh.
B:	Right, that's the way I am. I know the feeling.
A:	So, um, do you want to discuss the recipe?
B:	Well, you've been quite a few places there
A:	Deer spaghetti is real good.
B:	I live out in the country, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do and then, I had to wheel barrow it in.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	If it,
A:	Yes. They,
B:	Uh-huh. Yep, we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life, but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
A:	Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
B:	Have, have you been out of the country?
A:	and and it's least hard on your body,
B:	Oh. Well
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um. Now that would be good.
A:	Because they're, Well, they have lunch specials that you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, my God.
B:	and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, and it's always the same man
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Absolutely. Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does.
A:	That would be nice. I think I saw that on T V one time. They, maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
B:	Pardon?
A:	Well, that is interesting. Right.
B:	And, I'm like, I don't believe this.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	So that, that works out good.
A:	It's cut back, you know, considerably, but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood, so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
B:	Right.
A:	Really.
B:	I don't know, there's, there's big bins out there, I don't know if they ever get I, I really don't know what the details are. There should be someplace where you could call and find out. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest, you know, thing to you, but, I think there should be some kind of curbside service.
A:	I, I, actually I didn't go diving.
B:	Gorgeous. That's, you know, I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not, and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same. It's almost, you know, identical kind of country.
A:	and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona, for that family.
B:	So what, what, how do you spend the time with your children?
A:	Really? That much of a difference?
B:	Huh?
