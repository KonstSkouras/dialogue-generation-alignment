A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
B:	Yeah, I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem, and I think it could get worse.
A:	No. Yeah, I think so. I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious. You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Really? Huh. It really has been strange here this year, I mean, this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one.
A:	and so, you know, I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
B:	and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
A:	I, I know, but it, it's, it's, uh, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
B:	Yeah, so do we.
A:	I don't know that it does. I, I, don't know that, um, if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually, there are forever over, as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.
B:	but she seems to.
A:	You don't
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Okay, wow
B:	I, I, I really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
A:	But, uh,
B:	I don't know. You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it pre specified in the policy so much but I don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value on somebody's limb,  uh, arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.
A:	Right
B:	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
A:	and these kids, um, you know, every girl I taught, except for one, was pregnant.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
B:	Yeah. Right.
A:	Oh they are. I love it, it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that.
B:	Huh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right, right.
A:	but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
B:	And he spends, well, right now, he's down to like once a week, but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,  and help them with the language.
A:	So. Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.
B:	And one of the men got, uh, I think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for, uh, life imprisonment.
A:	Because everyone gains from it.
B:	Wow. Wow. That's a, a big job.
A:	Sure. Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh, yeah, you still have to do it. I, I,
B:	and that can be part of continuing education, maybe for judges
