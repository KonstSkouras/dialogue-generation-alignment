A:	Well, it was good to talk to you.
B:	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
A:	The factory was nice and, And is it different for the, for the B M W?
B:	, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I don't know that's true or not. I mean, I just heard it in passing, but so what does that,
A:	Well, it was good talking to you.
B:	Fifty-five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five. And the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.
A:	yeah , it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestles Quik.
B:	Well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
A:	Yep. And then, you know, if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to. The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more.
B:	I thought that would be good experience for me.
A:	And, you know, just, you see a lot of things like you, you know, was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired, and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
B:	Um.
A:	and I know she's eating the right things, and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her, so. It became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
B:	Yeah.
A:	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
B:	and I think this is really  is buyer beware.  Well, it is the best way  to do it, interestingly.
A:	um, yeah , right in the, in the lukewarm milk. Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and I would put it in the sink and I'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good. It seems to be better than putting the, the cornstarch into the liquid it, once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
B:	Right. Right. Yeah, it's nice to get out in the open air.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because, uh, well, like I say, we live a way and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.
A:	and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away
B:	Uh, yeah. They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company.
A:	I know, that's
B:	Five hundred of them are good, solid kids and I have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.
A:	Yes. When is yours on?
B:	Yeah.
A:	and it was for us many years,  for many years.
B:	I mean, people do,
A:	Yeah, it, it was pretty good, it, uh, sometimes I like a dramatization, and I like, uh, U S A, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their made for T V movies
B:	I know, and that makes me so mad You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently
A:	So I like Gordon Lightfoot, do you know who he is?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	No.
B:	What about you?
A:	I guess like, like they're nothing, I guess, nothing is as awful as abortion but like gun control and, uh, day care an things like that, and there are some very different views, uh, of the people connected with the program which I thought was really interesting, you know.
B:	you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time, and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,
A:	Unless, it's, it's a toy.
B:	Yeah, right, right,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. I think I think Texas is Texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty, and I think, I know California had it for a long time, and then they, uh, took it off the books, they repealed it
A:	And then there's also, uh, what we found, uh, in the state of, uh, South Dakota, the Black Hills.
B:	Yeah, and spend a day doing, that's really neat. I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time, but you know, every little bit helps.
A:	All right. Well, good to hear, good to hear.
B:	Uh, you're very fortunate.
A:	at least where you .
B:	Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
A:	Oh, I just love cats. I like dogs, they're okay, I had, I had a dog when I lived at home
B:	Well, when she got home, who took care of her?
A:	It was a joy in talking with you.
B:	They never go to see them.
A:	Ha-ha Well, I was kind of hoping with, you know, do you work for T I?
B:	There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.
A:	would be a definite deterrent and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.
B:	But, uh, sure is a heck of a lot of work.
A:	No, regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
B:	Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
A:	and they, everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. But, uh, it's, yeah.
B:	We started out with two, with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
A:	And, and I was trying to get my son to sing that. My husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song But, they, they do a lot of fun things. I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. Because you know there's just,
B:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one and I thought it would be more reliable.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
A:	There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
B:	But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.
A:	I can hear the accent now I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	it was not gross, I didn't see it but, um, got them.
A:	Is it?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right.
B:	Oh.
A:	Well it was nice talking with you.
B:	That's correct.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that was the most boring place on earth.
A:	So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, the, course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever, so they're giving the early release, uh,
B:	Uh, cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,
