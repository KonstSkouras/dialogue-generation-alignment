A:	I used to be a builder.
B:	Really.
A:	Of course, not.
B:	And, uh, you know, they had, uh, in fact on the news last night we were watching this, uh, man who lost his ten year old daughter. He ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone. now ten years old, she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes, you know.
A:	Uh, I, uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I know at this, I know I feel like I would never do that with my parents either, you know. But I, I really feel bad for the people I see not very, I'm not really, really experienced but like I said I just have that one family, and I just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and, than he thought it would be. But,
B:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think the last I heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars.
A:	Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general,
B:	Well, it's, uh, we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,
A:	Well, that's good. Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions, so I learned a lot about them. I haven't,  been to a lot,
B:	I know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
A:	Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had. I've, uh, Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, I, I don't know. A, a number every week.
B:	and then it was all year, there was just copperheads everywhere.
A:	My, my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.
B:	instead of being, watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. Uh, and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war, I guess about two and a half or three weeks in, we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would, uh, watch, uh, fifteen minutes before, fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news, or our local news. We would watch C N N until six thirty, then we would watch, uh, a rotating network news of either, uh, A B C, C B S, or N B C and we, we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.
A:	Yeah, fairly recently. Well, that's really sad. I hadn't thought about that in a long time.
B:	And they had misclassed the sex of back there and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies, and I took the baby and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like, half the price of a mouse,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh yeah, that's great, too. Uh-huh. Yeah, we did some remodeling when we bought a house, we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering, that's fun.
A:	so, uh, it was sort of,
B:	Well, it wasn't really. It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
A:	Gosh, small world, huh?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.
B:	I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	yeah, I've done it before and when I was in in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it,
B:	Yeah, it is a tough question.
A:	Yeah, and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone. And,
B:	Oh, wow. That is really interesting. Are you saying to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,
A:	Right. They don't have one of those. So, it, we decided that was it, you know, and, I mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card. We have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.
B:	Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
A:	Yeah, where are you?
B:	Yeah if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
A:	Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all
B:	And, and that way we can be sure, you know, we can find out the truth, we can find out what really happened and, and base the sentence on what the person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
A:	No, your, I have a friend now that has seven. And, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
B:	Yeah. It was a, Landmark is the one who built it.
A:	and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
B:	I'm going to get another one as soon as I get back in town. I'm going out of town this weekend, when I get back I'm going to find a cat. So,
A:	Yeah, it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
B:	and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them.
A:	Just hadn't heard much about them lately.
B:	Yeah, yeah, well I, I went to Dallas, uh, when I worked for T I in Abilene and, uh, I'm a little familiar with the city area, Forest Lane and, you know, through that, off, off the freeway.
A:	That,  that's real good.
B:	Right, or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous.
A:	You go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there. And I always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
B:	Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever. I mean, it's kind of, I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it, but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst. They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	it's been denied fortunately but,
A:	You know my husband's always got it on.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	No, I don't think there was. Um, I know a little bit more from a, a co-worker. Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.
A:	You know, and so, it's, it is, uh, we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.
B:	Yeah we, Two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh, finding what we consider to be, real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think.
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
A:	Oh.
B:	Um.
A:	That's real nice.
B:	I mean it sounds like a train. We have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house
A:	Yeah. No. *aa
B:	but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
A:	they had a yearly auction, they had a dance marathon for charity or, to, to support that, group.
B:	Yeah, my name's Bill. Well,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is it, that's good.
B:	What does that house got attraction?
A:	Oh I wouldn't either. There'd be no way.
B:	I think so, and a lot, I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right, right, right. And you really have to make, uh, quite a bit of money. The wife doesn't make it worth it, with the cost of day-care.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	recently
B:	Isn't that nice. I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,
A:	Snow,
B:	Oh, that's good, too.
A:	Uh-huh. And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
B:	Um, that's possible I guess.
A:	You think that that's, uh, pretty adequate coverage and you get. Uh-huh. It's historic events, huh.
B:	Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
A:	Hopefully,
B:	Uh-huh Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me.
B:	and I'm okay. But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that
A:	That's so stupid that you all have two teams.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
B:	That was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting.
A:	Sure, sure. So,
B:	So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
A:	Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
B:	but I really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.
A:	Oh, do they really. Curbside pick up?
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,  center.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ri-, Exactly.
A:	and, uh,
B:	Well I'm not talking about just in the school system.
A:	Upstate New York, yeah.
B:	Bye video
B:	Oh okay, you get so attached to them.
