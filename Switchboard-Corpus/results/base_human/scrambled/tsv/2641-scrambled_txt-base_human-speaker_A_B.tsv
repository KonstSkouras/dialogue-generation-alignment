A:	That stress is a very prominent factor in the work place and it affects,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, small world. So, I, uh, I know Chris
B:	What about your home?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	if I had,
A:	I don't, oh, plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York, so, you know .
B:	Well, yeah, that's that's true.
A:	Yeah, it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff. The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.
B:	My community, that's cute. I live in a place called Dye Mound.
A:	I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years, I've had him probably five years.
B:	Well, that's a good experience, I think, and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good and they kind of boil down to, uh, any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with
A:	Well.
B:	Right, exactly.
A:	Most,
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Really?
B:	first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know, and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	You're, you're making me hungry here.
A:	Oh. That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing. Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, well, good. Well, I, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, you know, obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up.
A:	And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to. But I agree with you, the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.
B:	Sure.
A:	and I'm Brian.
B:	Well, the way things are going.
A:	Oh, you lucky thing.
B:	That's right.
A:	and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Oh, yeah. That's beautiful.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Well, you know, somebody elected that recently.
A:	Because we have, you know, everywhere that a tree is down people need help and,  we're all, all, a lot of older folks need help getting,  their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone
B:	Right, right.
A:	Huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
B:	Well, not necessarily
A:	Yeah, that's true. But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right. Oh, I understand
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well   well, who, who else is going to do this, then?
B:	I think in and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available.
A:	That's right.
B:	But it's, it's inexpensive
A:	I know.
B:	Oh, goodness. You get so attached to them.
A:	I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, yeah,
A:	Yeah, and, uh, um, yeah, we had cat, you know, my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my Mom developed an allergies,
B:	I'm so sorry.
A:	Uh-huh. Paris. And my cousin lives in Paris and she's lived there for like, oh, off and on for twenty years.
B:	You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know
A:	Right.
B:	Huh.
A:	Time, uh-huh. Yes. I was, I would just be, I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	No, no.
B:	But if I'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time, I want some real good classical music.
A:	You,
B:	Oh, okay. Near Polk?
A:	You think that's great.
B:	but I think it's Elijah
A:	Oh, you are? East or west, I'm from Pittsburgh. *listen
B:	Wow. That's huge .
A:	Go ahead ,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes, it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.
A:	Okay. I think I did know that, I just forgot. Okay.
B:	Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and I ask in Wal-Mart and they said they moved it just behind.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh
A:	Yeah.
B:	It is, and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, uh, built
A:	He, uh, um, last I heard, he, uh, he beat a push for the death penalty. Now whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.
B:	Okay, well we are in south Garland, but yeah, next time you go, uh, you know, check into it, they have, uh, it is just like, uh, a bus card and they just punch it. You know, it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you.
A:	and we ended up with them, right. And so we were, walking up
B:	It's, it's phenomenal. It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
A:	Uh-huh. Well, our home is, uh, probably, for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here. Uh, most of the, the homes that they're building, well, I shouldn't say all of them, but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars.
B:	But it's just, it just was not and you get stung a time or two,
A:	I had a friend in I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.
B:	What's that?
A:	Right.
B:	It's, it's real easy, I like doing that part.
A:	Tell me what you like to do.
B:	Um, so that's, that kind of helps out in terms of,  you know, keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry.
A:	uh, in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem, I know it's, you know, worse in the larger cities. Um, it's kind of a concern for me, in fact, at the moment I'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and, uh, it's, I am single and female, you definitely are going to worry about the location, and, uh, you know, accessibility of people to be able to break in. I live on a third floor now, but, I, you know, I'm real concerned that I, I don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that, and, the, um,
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh, or if somebody gets sick. Yeah, or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. That's neat.
A:	Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Five bedrooms. Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
B:	they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
A:	It's enough space for two people Yeah.
B:	Her eyes are changing,
A:	The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.
B:	Have you seen, uh, CANINE. The movie, oh,
A:	Uh-huh. Because I guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe, uh, they've increased funding for the Peace Corps. Some of the, I guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known,
B:	it's  like I say, it's not a lot, but it helps people. Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
A:	Yeah. Well, she stayed, she stayed in a temporary nursing home.  Until she was okay.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Okay. Well, how do you feel about, uh, drug testing?
B:	but it's not,
A:	Yeah, the cheese fondue I make, some people like swiss, um, I prefer cheddar. And I'll mix, I won't make, I won't have a sharp cheddar because it, for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp, cheddar.
B:	and um, that's really what makes the most sense, because you don't have to use so much water, and
A:	Oh, sure.
B:	Yeah, uh, of course, I like gadgets and, and, uh, fun things, on the cars, which are all the things, course, the
A:	And Spanish is a lot like English.
B:	Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
A:	And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
B:	Yes, absolutely.
A:	I really think, I think, um, people, you should, I, you know, the kids today I teach, I spend a lot of my time teaching college students
B:	Right.
A:	Right, okay.
B:	Right, yeah.
A:	Yeah, yeah
B:	Then she was starting to get, uh, you know, lose memory sometimes and, which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, so they come here and they don't know what the heck they're doing. And they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities. And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would do, like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
B:	and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions.
A:	and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.
B:	Over the uncooked rice?
A:	is that suppose to be.
B:	and, I think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
A:	Potato salad and, uh,
B:	And, on a, a scale, I guess it's still considered small. It just have a lot of different laboratories.
A:	Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.
B:	And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged,  you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and so it wasn't so bad.
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
B:	It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother but, uh, I like I like the way I did it.
A:	yeah, it's, you know, it's a pain to clean but, you know, we used to, I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans . They didn't,
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
B:	Uh, anything
