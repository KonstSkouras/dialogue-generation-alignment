A:	With all of you living so close together.
B:	And I've never been sorry,
A:	Yeah. Yeah that would be a real good idea. I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of. They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our, in our city .
B:	Well, I'll talk to you later,
A:	Um, the area itself, uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, um, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments
B:	Right.
A:	So,
B:	like who knows, you know.
A:	Uh, one's real nice, but the other one is a, well, she's pretty wild.
B:	Yes, yes.
A:	Rowlett, Texas.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
B:	And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, are you really?
A:	It really was, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right, right.
B:	I have two daughters.
A:	and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.
B:	To worry about it.
A:	And then,
B:	Yes. Ever, you can't even, when I was a kid, I would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes, and, as long as my mom had a general idea where I was and I was back on the time,
A:	Yes. Exactly.
B:	So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.
A:	Oh.
B:	Ugh, ugh.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	no, no, but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense. So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at, all now we're, we're, you know, we, I use it occasionally but I pay it right off. We're ...
A:	Oh, all the time. Do you watch CHEERS
B:	But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
A:	And the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
A:	Yeah. There's,
B:	I tape it.
A:	Yeah, I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they, they tell me the same thing.
B:	That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
A:	Uh-huh. Me too. I work at, uh, the Georgia Tech Research Institute.
B:	If you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I try to ride the stationary bicycle every day about five miles
B:	yeah, and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of O strip east to west, eastern part,
A:	Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
B:	The the one week uh seven day the delay
A:	That's right, you, you have to work on. You, really do.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Um, actually I found it in one of my mother's, um, homemade cookbooks, I mean, something she had collected out of WOMAN'S DAY or something.
B:	Polk Institute. It's, uh, an old, uh, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. Uh,
A:	Oh, really?
B:	It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives, so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that
A:	And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, and they both enjoy it. So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
B:	Uh-huh. Wow, that's cute. That's neat, yeah. When you,
A:	But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.
B:	I don't know. It's an interesting problem. I happen to, um, I'm a pediatrician.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, because we mow, you know, a good bit of ground around the house area.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so.
B:	Well, who's the running, is it Sammy Smith, or is it, Emmett Smith.
A:	Well, that's a great idea, that's a great idea.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I mean, I've got, the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose, but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,
B:	Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
A:	Oh, I saw that.
B:	But, uh, we,
A:	I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
B:	Yeah.
