A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, and I'm from Pittsburgh so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. I know, my son is a biker and he, he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
B:	Um.
A:	Oh, sure, sure.
B:	And, uh, they, uh, will get to playing chase through the house,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah, I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that, that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,
B:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, we're all skinny farts so, I, it, so when it comes to, I like to cook and eat and, to have, mainly, I guess, I get to
B:	Yeah, exactly.
A:	And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting.
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on, on news that way. And, then we would do a similar thing, uh, at uh, ten forty-five because, uh, C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage, uh, and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would, would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. Uh, three of the networks here, on their local news, uh, that if, if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who, murdered who, or stole what. from whom.
A:	Good to hear from you.
B:	yeah, you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, this is not in my control.
A:	Yeah. We do too. I think a lot of people agree the same.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
A:	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They, they fear being a burden to, to family members.
B:	Oh, God.
A:	Well, it seems to me that, that I'm paying anyway, because when I go, or my insurance carrier, anyway, when I pay something, the bills seem inordinately high.
B:	And you're more receptive.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	They're just getting, uh, put on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room so they get, they get lighter sentences,
B:	I mean, they,
A:	if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.
B:	I, I would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. You know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
A:	That's kind of what, like his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia,
B:	Yeah. It would be great, I mean, uh, the glasses that, the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.
A:	Yep.
B:	That we, we wake up to television news and, uh, uh, shower and dress, and whatever to that, and then because of the fact that my wife and I ride to work together, uh, in a car, we, we chat at each other rather than, than something else.
A:	Well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year?
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
B:	Oh.
A:	Did you really? What, black ones?
B:	I, I think so, and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one, and, uh, and then, uh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	That's true if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket. Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar. I live in one, I don't have a swimming pool. And mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.
B:	Well, it, it is, it, you know, on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh, you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, it's a mark against them,
A:	Go ahead.
B:	Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him. I said, now you do like cats, right. We don't
A:	Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music, or do, is it talk shows.
B:	If you're, like I've, I work with, uh, computer systems a lot. So it's kind of hard to say, you know. If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down, you know Yeah, you did a great job. But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers, you know.  Or do design studies or something.
A:	Huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Yes, well, I think sometimes when people get to be a certain age, other people have to kind of help them make decisions. It sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home, but she's accepted it real well now
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There has, that's right.
B:	Yeah. And the, the laws are all, the rules. Some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women
A:	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.
B:	and they clean it up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But that's, uh, they're, so close, I, I don't consider Mexican people in the same category with, uh, especially like, uh, people who come from cultures that don't have the same, uh, kind of moral upbringing that we have.
A:	Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, yeah, we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
B:	Yes.
A:	Well, those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
B:	everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.
A:	Oh. Those aren't too pleasant.
B:	so I know it sounds like a rationalization but it's, I really think it's true for our family, and I think it has worked very well.
A:	I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
B:	Okay, well
A:	Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. I just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, I tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it I just, I don't know that it's always effective but I guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh,
B:	And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. That, you know, you, never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
A:	I mean, I'm not kidding you.
B:	Oh, I know it The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, it's, it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs, at that point which could be one of, you know, many different night programs but it goes into night programs.
A:	Yeah
B:	but.
A:	Right.
