A:	And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.
B:	Surely.
A:	Like, what is a book on your list, you know I have a list too and I have never gotten to it
B:	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
A:	Uh, oh, I think, we're, we're supposed to hang up.
B:	Yeah, you had to, memorize it,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and at least I had some interest in, a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are, they say oh, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer. Why? Because they make a lot of money.
A:	You know, even if they're in good health it's incredible.
B:	I understand that. Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?
B:	The area I work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so.

B:	My husband got his big garage. He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.
A:	And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that, if I were let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
B:	Huh. Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.
A:	And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
B:	and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes. Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind, and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,  that have been handed,  down for years

A:	Yeah.
B:	after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.
A:	Well, it's very true.
B:	And I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.
A:	I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. So it's almost all glass.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Oh, did you?

A:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about. I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.
A:	Uh-huh. There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
