A:	My grandmother lived with us, um, until August, um, and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home. She has leukemia
B:	And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
A:	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, uh, to convict somebody
B:	We did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, Boone Greene, no out at, uh Andrews,
A:	Mandatory just like, like the draft. No.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That is good.
B:	Right and the weed come up,
A:	Oh.
B:	I mean, some of the,
A:	I worked for the, uh, Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and I sold uh, you know, manure.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
A:	That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something, they go, I don't want to do this anymore and you're like God, I really want you to do it.
B:	but there are others in the family who do them better.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.
A:	Oh, I've never heard of Polk but,
B:	It is great.
A:	I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.
B:	That's about what we do too.
A:	Um, we got two cats.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Wow.
B:	If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.
A:	But she had, it was interesting, you know, I don't know how valid it is, but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement. Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year? Is there kind of a, you know, salads go first and things like that?
B:	that is just really neat. Because I,
A:	Yeah, huh-uh, and especially not in some of these big cities, like in Dallas I mean they've had, they're up in the top, top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on, on, in the line of duty and that's really sad.
B:	Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed?
A:	Well, I am a travel agent at heart, and my hobby is just, I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh, but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband, so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
B:	I've,
A:	Hi.
B:	That's great. But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think they should have to do a year
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh. There, there are other, uh, uh, I'm not sure what you would call them, they the small, uh, competing independent sort of newspapers. Little small weekly things, but there's only one daily, uh, called the NEWS AND OBSERVER, fondly referred to here by some as the, uh, uh, sometimes the Noise and Observer.
A:	Well, not, not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. I'm an engineer.
B:	That's right. That's right. Right. even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on
A:	Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
B:	Oh, really?
A:	Right.
B:	Oh, my heaven.
A:	Yeah. This is,
B:	It was something easily forgotten. So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or, or should I say seven. I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. She does have to really work at it, but, uh, so,
A:	Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
