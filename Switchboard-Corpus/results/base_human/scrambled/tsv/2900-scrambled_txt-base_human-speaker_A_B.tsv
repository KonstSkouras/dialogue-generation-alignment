A:	So I don't think that they deserve anything less
B:	Yes, I have four cats.
A:	Oh, really?
B:	I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about. In L A, it's pretty bad.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh.
B:	I think I pay forty-two percent.
A:	And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
B:	Yeah.
A:	For colleges?
B:	Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in, in the entire D C area. I'm, I'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of Washington D C, and Montgomery County, Maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to,
A:	No, I'm the one,
B:	Sure do.
A:	But our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, uh, animals
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
A:	it seems like, really a rough time
B:	Right, but it still has to be a group of your peers.
A:	I do. I have to be real careful.
B:	Well, there is a guy in Dallas, that's all he does.
A:	My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping. So that just kind of works out real well.
B:	Yeah. I have two plots, one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, it was good talking to you too.
A:	Emmett Smith, yeah.
B:	Well, that's right. A lot of people they flunk out or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Huh?
A:	Okay, thanks.
B:	that should be life, but, instead, in, in given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know, and less they're out.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, you know, if, I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
A:	All right.
B:	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
A:	And I spend most of my time carpooling
B:	I mean, I, I used to enjoy going, I mean I still do kind of enjoy it, but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that I really, really enjoy seeing.
A:	Oh, God, I can't, Haven't been up there, last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad
B:	I really haven't, I really haven't, uh, when we built it ten years ago, it was, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
B:	And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
A:	Oh, so do I.
B:	I have a friend who has one and, and he lets me, you know, no problem borrowing if it's, just a hassle when you know, to go up
A:	my kid will do four or five hours this week for me. No problem.
B:	Your news is on at eleven?
A:	that's for sure.
B:	Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,
A:	Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
