A:	My wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.
B:	I see.
A:	Uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. And pylons and things.
B:	And, uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah, they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
B:	Bye.
A:	There are people now that are obsolete point and fact just, just like endangered species of animals, so there are quote tribes of people, that are endangered or obsolete.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.
B:	I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but, uh, it's on the books.
A:	Well, I, I,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, they're going to get better. I mean, you know.
B:	Oh, yeah. Put them in salad, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, do you ever watch CHEERS?
A:	Right.
B:	and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard? That's true.
A:	She's, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
B:	Um.
A:	Uh,
B:	and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes, so. But, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, that are more, you know, nonessential items.
A:	Well, I'm just saying I shouldn't, I shouldn't blast him like that, say, oh well, Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them, I mean, he didn't get to see much action. But, too bad. Because now, now, you know, he had a shot and, and didn't look too good and so, no one's going to have much faith in him any more.
B:	so I called four or five dog trainers because I don't like the little dogs.
A:	Because I'm always worrying it won't firm up because it, when you take it out of the saucepan it's like, boy, I hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick, you know, when you cook a package, it's, it's a little less,
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's incentive , speaking of Bush, we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush, they that had a story where he went to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff.
A:	But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
B:	Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
A:	Tight turns, hard acceleration. I've seen a lot of Mustangs, uh, compete and it's interesting. They get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class.
B:	It, it, it's pretty bad here, too.
A:	You know. Uh-huh.
B:	That's what I've heard.
A:	Right.
B:	Well, my home at the moment is an apartment.
A:	You know.
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
A:	Uh-huh. It sure is. The, you know, as far as, I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this, and it was something more than just the conferences. They were using it as eating out, uh, when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
B:	Quicker  maybe, yeah.
A:	Yes.
B:	Uh, what do you think?
A:	In fact, I think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback. I haven't, uh, I haven't kept up with it lately, but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on, or, or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody, but it wasn't anybody I'd really heard of. But I heard on the radio this morning, or yesterday morning, that, uh, Aikman's back in practicing, doing real, real well. Um, who is it, Michael Irvin
B:	So I do love classical music or it or, or, uh, contemporary classical.
A:	Oh, God.
B:	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
A:	And then before the milk gets too hot, um, I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good. And then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much, I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's, it starts thickening, when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little, I don't know, it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch, and you just keep beating it in. And it's the, the trick is, is to have this blender, so, if you were, you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time, it's, you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened I cook it for a good, once it starts boiling, I just, I cook it for a good seven minutes, seven to ten minutes
B:	Well, I thought I'd, you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. I don't know if you're familiar with that operation, but, what you do is you just build up the pressure
A:	Wow.
B:	What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?
A:	Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh. Right, because they're a danger to everybody else. Huh, that's interesting. I have to, uh agree with that.
B:	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
A:	But the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike. I think it's pretty much typical for this area.
B:	But it's, it's so lonely, you know they can't get out and see anyone and I mean, it's hard for, for someone like me to understand that
A:	Oh, no, no, no, no.
B:	Yeah.
A:	yeah, in certain crimes.
B:	Uh, both
A:	I kind of, uh, stopped listening after a while.
B:	is that so? I didn't know that.
A:	the I think the, I guess the only real, um, benefit I guess you could say working, for me working here, besides I mean I'm learning and stuff because,  I'm at, you know, in school.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yes. Yes.
A:	I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.
B:	Oh, it's, it is. I mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.
A:	So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
B:	Uh-huh. Okay. Well ...
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, I don't like nineties.
A:	Right.
B:	Yeah, well, that makes a really big difference. But, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,
A:	but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
B:	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
A:	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.
B:	Not too much. What kind of, what kind of things do you write?
A:	Forgot about that.
B:	Okay.
A:	Huh-uh. Well, I'm in Pennsylvania.
B:	Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
A:	Have you, have, have you seen this often?
B:	Right.
A:	and, they were very helpful
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Instead of being carried
B:	Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, those onions, I think, we, we planted like twice as much this year because, you know, we got, onions and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like October,
A:	Well, it can get expensive
B:	Yeah.
A:	Well, good to hear. I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
B:	Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. Uh, others have, there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra. Uh, just, you know, different backgrounds. It's been really kind of interesting.
A:	Okay. I'm sure that I probably, uh, prescribe to different magazines ones that you do
B:	Yeah, it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	Real excited when I heard this. So far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football, I love this.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Nursing homes.
B:	Yeah, yeah
A:	And it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California, and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh yeah, yeah, we do, we call that doing biscuits,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
B:	Okay.
A:	Oh, don't you hate that? I've got a, I got a few pounds to lose myself. That's okay.
B:	Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything or are they just,
A:	No, that's okay
B:	Okay
A:	Wow. Why is that? Do you know? I mean
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, okay, I see.
B:	Well, because my,
A:	Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.
B:	No.
A:	Well, right now we're just renting, but it is a home. Um,
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Because even if you said, okay, you know, armed forces could have them, some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
B:	Yeah, see, that's the same thing here.
A:	it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything. But it's, um, it's really refreshing. So,
B:	Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, uh, chemical services to come, out and spray for weeds, and fertilize, and all that and take that one step out of .
A:	Yes
B:	Yeah, no, that would be, what did they do, everyone come around and watch them.
A:	Well, it doesn't make sense. Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
B:	Well, for some things.
A:	so there's, everybody had deer coming out their ears. So,
B:	it, you know, you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,  uh, small city type problems,
A:	Uh-huh.
