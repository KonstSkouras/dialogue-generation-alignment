A:	So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did.
B:	Uh, no, no not, no, this was, well, I am actually from Mississippi, and, so that's,
A:	Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts.
B:	they have some nice stuff down there. I miss it
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Ooh. Uh-huh. Where in Colorado?
B:	They've done special stories on the news, local news here.
A:	but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that
B:	Yeah. I could see that, then maybe.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, no, no, no. Someone has been lying to you. What they use is roast beef.
A:	And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
B:	A whole new world. Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh, now there have been worse summers. In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,
B:	But if I had the little red C R X , I guess the interior would have to be black leather and I'd have to live with that. And if I got the C R X it would have to have a real good sound system in it because I'd want that too.
A:	and I find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people I talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity, and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
B:	Bye.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's true.
A:	Okay, did you vote in the last, uh, national election?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
B:	and I, by administrator I, I think I mean, I, they didn't, they did not define it, but for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
A:	and we were much happier,
B:	And this Christmas, I went to Turkey. But basically, it's a, for the past couple of years, I, since my parents are, are, well, I'm from Argentina, and my parents live down there. So, all the traveling I do is alone.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
A:	but, uh, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably feel any differently,
B:	so.
A:	Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it away, and that's it,
B:	but the rest of the time she's free. She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that So she enjoys staying at home, but, uh, the money part of it is not as rewarding, obviously, but there's different rewards, you know, different kinds of rewards.
A:	And, uh, I'm in California,  which has a lot of immigration. Probably more than any where else in the country, though I'm not sure if that's the case.
B:	But, you know, like, four, I mean four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition. I'm paying, you know, three thousand, no, what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.
A:	I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
B:	Right, Right. Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I said I'm losing you, you're getting you're fading out.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. And, is your mother still living?
B:	It seems like they would be able to.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
A:	Right. Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well.
B:	Yeah.
A:	um, it's really nice.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
B:	And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
A:	Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.
B:	That's okay, they say when you're done you're done,
A:	So, what kind of a house do you live in?
B:	And, uh, a lot of those people have, and at time, you know, they all knew one another.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	They pay that judge, they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge
B:	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
