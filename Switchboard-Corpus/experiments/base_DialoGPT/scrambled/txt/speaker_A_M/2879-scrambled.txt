A|Yeah.
M|Don't!
A|and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
M|How much do you pay?
A|and I've got little children here who needed me here she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.
M|No, no, no. This is the Mississippi.
A|so they think, well, you know, why vote.
M|My plan is to wake me up earlier.
A|That's great.
M|No, I'm not.
A|Yes.
M|Uh, what?
A|Right, okay.
M|Smog is in LA.
A|But, uh,
M|i
A|Well, church softball leagues, so,
M|Well, they are the only ones that aren't a big deal to me.
A|Right.
M|I'm not sure you understand how that works.
A|Oh, yes.
M|I'll be back.
A|No.
M|Ahaaaaaaayyyy.
A|Yeah, uh , I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,
M|Was it really?
A|Oh, he was found guilty, yeah.
M|Well, they're both boys.
A|Uh-huh.
M|She nods and walks away
A|Really? Well, that's a good deal.
M|I'm
A|Yeah.
M|No. I stay in my house.
A|and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. So, I
M|How is this a thing?
A|Some buildings do, it depends on the location. The area I live in right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all, no burglar alarms, no guards.
M|The paper is chemically treated, so it can't break down.
A|And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system. So what, what,
M|I am.
A|Yeah. Uh-huh.
M|What are you, a fruit farmer?
A|But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to.
M|Yeah, to,
A|You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting. But people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair, and when they recognize that it's their tax money, they're going to do more about it. I I'll tell you one quick, uh, one thing very interesting. C B S, after the State of the Union address is going to open up a telephone line, an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country.
M|I.
A|My grandmother lived with us, um, until August, um, and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home. She has leukemia
M|... but then you have to take care of them
A|Yeah.
M|No.
A|so.
M|Not that much, just a lot of work.
A|Well, uh, that's great. We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit and then he does all the repairing, you know, he does
M|I'm from the east coast, I'm used to it, but I like
A|You know what I'm saying? Like,
M|Uh, you know, I don't have any special qualifications.
A|The, the investigator. Yeah, he, he got off right away.
M|
A|Oh, I'm sure, yeah, there, I mean, you can go down a street, and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
M|It's a long story.
A|Uh,
M|Uhh, what did he expect?
A|What I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something, I make, uh, food kabobs. You take little toothpicks and cut up, uh, pineapple and strawberry, and even banana if you can do it just before you leave.
M|I mean you're, I'm going to, I've been, I know.
A|Yeah, oh, but, boy you try get into that, you'd really open a can of worms.
M|There's one of those that was working for the American Cancer Society, and then the same one who worked for the British Cancer Society.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yea, I am, and I'm just here for the fun.
A|you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this, there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING, by Richard Fugate
M|What happened to you?
A|Uh-huh.
M|How do you know this?
A|Yes. Yes, and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside, and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much Saturdays and Sunday, this is fine, but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,
M|I'm a student and I've got a car.
A|Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
M|I have no idea why I am so good at this.
A|but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use. I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore.
M|Well if they're not going to be there for a while, they're probably not going home.
A|And Um I believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in
M|The last time they were here they werent.
A|That's right. If I have a problem discipline, you know, I think, now, boy, I really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
M|You have to get the trade in.
A|Bang, *one utt?? bang.
M|Well, mine is still there.
A|Uh-huh. I've never done potato. We used to do it at home when I was a kid, had a huge garden.
M|.
A|Of course.
M|... I don't know...
A|Probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles, the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
M|You know what?
A|Oh it's tough, it really is.
M|I'm sorry?
A|Saint Claude is that sound familiar?
M|Are they?
A|Uh-huh.
M|Oh. Um,
A|And go out and spend it. And, um, it's just unreal. I mean, I don't like credit cards, I wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know, the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation. They would let you use it maybe once a year. You know, I mean, of course, I guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but, um, I have seen so many people and I have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen. She got, uh, I can't remember what she called it, it's some kind of, maybe it's sure or something like that, it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,
M|Oh, yeah, it
A|Uh-huh.
M|I get money
A|Well, great. That's excellent.
M|No, not you.
A|Uh-huh.
M|She's a human.
A|Sure. Okay.
M|What about your family?
A|Good point. We've got enough without without a passport there's plenty.
M|
A|Oh.
M|So... you think that's good?
A|Yeah, we all used to,
M|Not in the area I'm in.
A|Um yeah. Yeah.
M|You,
M|I
