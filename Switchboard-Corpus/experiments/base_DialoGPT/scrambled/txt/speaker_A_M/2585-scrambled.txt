A|Best friends, now.
M|Well, uh, uh.
A|And they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical.
M|It's not that.
A|Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.
M|English is my second language.
A|And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. So there's one or two nights a week, we have a, on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening and we stay home that evening, all of us, and we do things together.
M|I'm Brian.
A|Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes? Or just,
M|Uhhh... I'm in Dallas.
A|and, uh, I like those. We very seldom watch any, uh, Public Television, Channel Thirteen. Do you watch it much?
M|I'm not too good with names
A|Right, right, that's, uh,
M|I think you're a little bit off.
A|So,
M|Mmmmmm, taste.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm not sure if you're liberal or not, but you have a point
A|I know, I do too, I, most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like, you know, that's really why God and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't, I had my tubes tied so you,
M|What does it taste like?
A|And then I went to England a few years ago.
M|I live in Bradford.
A|There has, that's right.
M|i don't think it's a real life thing, but i
A|so, you know, they're not, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,
M|Why?
A|Uh-huh.
M|Oh, yeah.
A|Yeah, yeah, and it gives you a, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it,  and it seems like ...
M|I've never heard of a single girl having a son or daughter.
A|You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
M|What is the second floor?
A|Oh, she's about four. She's not completely pure. We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy. She looks like a she looks just like a Golden Retriever, but she's a little bit smaller. She's like fifty-five pounds.
M|It's not like they play each other every year.
A|because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old
M|I've never said that I don't like it.
A|My word, it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
M|Hong Kong
A|Uh-huh  We're  packing and getting ready to go to .
M|... um, how did she die?
A|And it was just, I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,
M|Nope,
A|Uh-huh.
M|So, how many times is this gonna be posted?
A|Uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
M|I dont know, how many cups of rice?
A|Uh-huh.
M|Hmmm, I think I might go there.
A|Oh, I imagine.
M|He had to get.it was.in.greee.me.up
A|And, uh, the green onions are coming along.
M|
A|Uh-huh
M|Because they are better than the other students.
A|They don't go and see them. That's right.
M|I have no idea what that story is about.
A|Uh-huh. There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.
M|Ohhh, it's not the same guy...
A|I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
M|Yeah, it's a lot easier to just put them in a different sentence, like in the case of the people that are already dead.
A|Yeah. Well, I figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so I want  to have a shop.
M|You know, I think, that's how they do it.
A|And that, I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. It was really,
M|I'm not a huge fan of the new colors.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were in the Midwest
A|Um.
M|You're
A|Yeah, but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers. We have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.
M|pull it, it's, it,
A|and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.
M|Oh, Debor
A|they paid fifty-eight for it.
M|What about Sevren
A|Uh-huh.
M|Oh,
A|Really?
M|laughs
A|Uh-huh. Born and raised Texan, huh.
M|I'm, um, just talking in general.
A|And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
M|You're right, it's probably your teeth.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yeah, uh.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yes, but the climate is much better than it was before
A|Yes. Uh-huh.
M|It's the show.
A|and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.
M|.
A|Well, I used to make the regular pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day, where you cut the pie, it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red, and I'm like, oh, this is kind of groedy .
M|You know.
A|Oh, gosh.
M|You can watch them, but they don't like it.
A|It might be handy,
M|You don't know my life.
A|and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
M|I do.
A|Oh. Okay.
M|That's good.
A|Oh, okay.
M|Well, I'm not a little worried.
A|Oh, okay, yeah, I got my brother and my whole family there. I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.
M|Yeah, Saint.Claude
A|My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
M|uh, uh
A|So, it's been fun.
M|... I don't know what to say.
A|No, not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
M|Yes, yes, I like, you like, I, you, like, yes.
A|Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
M|What did he do?
A|and I find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people I talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity, and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
M|Do you think they'll ever stop?
M|I know, I'm like a hundred pages in.
