A|Most,
M|What about a twelve people?
A|Uh, I don't take anymore than that
M|I would, but I'd have to be the one to ask you.
A|The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,
M|Uuhh uh uh.
A|The cat was here first so I know, it's hard.
M|I think we are, uh, uh
A|Yeah, yeah, I agree.
M|You mean the truck?
A|So, uh,
M|I have a cat, it's okay.
A|But it was,
M|I
A|Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
M|They're all grown up now.
A|Yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back. If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
M|I ate a lot and now I have no appetite.
A|Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
M|We are very aware of the human condition.
A|Oh, no, no, no, no.
M|What kind of food do you think would be best?
A|Yeah.
M|Uh, we've never had a break in.
A|Uh-huh.
M|... And then he, he wants, to go fly, and do something.
A|Uh-huh.
M|If you do, could you tell me?
A|I like the Moody Blues. Did you like them?
M|HUH, HUH.
A|Yeah. We do too. I think a lot of people agree the same.
M|You can't.
A|More taxes you pay.
M|They're a different breed.
A|Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had. I've, uh, Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, I, I don't know. A, a number every week.
M|That's why there are so many people.
A|Beets. Yeah, we've got some beets, uh-huh.
M|What? Uh, uh, I'm not really interested in that.
A|but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal. I, some of the cases I've heard about over the years,
M|I, I,
A|Uh-huh. So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.
M|Well, I don't know.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|I think so.Well, the cars are my main car.To me, the best car is the mustang.
A|Yeah.
M|I don'ts
A|it's a four bedroom home It has about, I guess, eighteen hundred square feet It's on one floor
M|Well, I'm a bit busy with work, but I'll be back soon.I'll be home in about an hour.But I can trade for a few hours.
A|Oh. Trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?
M|Oh, do you?
A|And, uh, so, we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory, and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
M|You have family?
A|but, um, I don't know do you like, I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
M|You're talking about the kittens, right?
A|Right, that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
M|They have some nice beaches, and a big aquarium.
A|I mean, I get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. So, no, this was given to us by some friends.
M|And, uh, uh
A|Uh, it was in March of last year. So, uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
M|Mexico. We have.
M|I don't think I'm a cat.
