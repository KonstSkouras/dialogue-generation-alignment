A|No, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
M|...
A|Well, I just,
M|So
A|and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.
M|I.
A|Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, yeah, we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
M|It was a joke
A|Oh.
M|Uhuhuh. Uhuhuhuh
A|Uh-huh
M|You know, I usually have to check things.
A|Oh, is that right? Okay.
M|He's
A|Yeah.
M|I'm saying that there is a difference between being right and being right.
A|Yeah. Well, the Cardinals, I don't know. I think the Cowboys probably have a, a better team. They just, at the end of the season, the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt, because, uh, Laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all. Of course, he sat along the sidelines all season, he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.
M|Are you a teacher?
A|Right.
M|They are still a crime, though.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I don't think there
A|But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really, I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.
M|He had it.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm a private school teacher.
A|I know.
M|I'm sure I'll find someone to date.
A|Uh-huh.
M|And the worst part is that the majority of the population was in the middle of the city.
A|Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
M|I'd rather just get the P C
A|Uh-huh.
M|How do you do it?
A|Huh.
M|Umm... I think that's a myth.
A|Right, because that would the eight o'clock here.
M|It is.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you get better soon.
A|Okay.
M|What about her?
A|in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street.
M|
A|yeah Sure
M|I think he was a dog, he was the most loving, the most obedient cat I ever had.
A|so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. So it's I don't know. It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a,
M|That's what I thought.
A|In fact, I am at work right now. Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela. Uh, I think what is really important, uh, of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job. And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits. Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
M|It's
A|Oh.
M|Are you sure you are a middle school girl?
A|Oh, well, yeah
M|Uhhh. I don't think so.
A|so she didn't have to be transported back and forth. So, she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well. It's not her favorite place to be in. She'd much rather be here with me. But when it got to the point I was spending more time at the hospital with her,
M|No. I want to see the eggs hatch
A|So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. Right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. Uh, I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
M|Yes.And.You.can.watch.all.of.the.the.
A|Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
M|I do.
A|Of course, their seasons are switched.
M|New York
A|I don't know. Yeah, our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now. I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
M|...
A|Right. Yeah, that would be a real good motivation for people.
M|I know
M|Yeah I know.
