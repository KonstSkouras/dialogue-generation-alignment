A|Yeah.
M|I see you're?
A|I do. I have to be real careful.
M|
A|and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
M|That's true.
A|So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I would.
M|I'm not sure what you mean.
A|Now, um,
M|I know enough about it.
A|I may still be, um, we,
M|Are you the building on the right?
A|Uh-huh.
M|June.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm just here for the weather.
A|Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers', uh, recent, uh, piece for, uh, Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful. But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are, are seeing their real incomes, and thus, standards of living, decline. And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve. That's not a formula for a better society.
M|Yeah, some of them.
A|That would be fair.
M|She was a girl, right?
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Sure, that happens quite a bit,
M|
A|Uh-huh. We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though, our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.
M|That, and the whole,''
A|And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.
M|I don't, I don't, I have no idea.
A|because I was already in Hong Kong and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride.
M|I'm interested
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm from the states.
A|Oh, I think it is.
M|Wait, what?
A|Uh-huh.
M|that,
A|That's really stupid.
M|I think they're just not as funny as they used to be.
A|you know what I'm saying? That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
M|I don't know, but I think you have to do jazz.
A|It's really kind of fun.
M|Do they have different kinds?
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|Not sure.
A|and they're just really close here. And his mother has bad health too and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
M|There are many lawyers.
A|Yeah.
M|You know, you're not wrong.
A|he said that, uh, Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time. So, sounds like he's going to be all right for next season. They're just trying not to overwork him right now, until he gets his shoulder, uh, back in it was his shoulder, wasn't it, that he had the problems with?
M|We have no money to buy.
A|I know, if somebody doesn't do something. Uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?
M|That's not really the case, I've never had a case in which the defendant was not involved.
A|Oh, yeah Yeah.
M|Do you have a resume?
A|Uh-huh, wow, yeah.
M|Because we have a little plot, and a lot of plots.
A|Oh.
M|They are happening
A|North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
M|I guess.Yeah.Its a little hard to explain.They are like a small group of people.
A|Oh, I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard
M|is your news on?
A|Yeah, I know, and that's, you know, like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
M|Ugh, I love that!
A|um, but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,
M|I
A|I guess, I'm, I'm a student right now and I don't make a whole lot of money and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long. My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything, but, uh, I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a,
M|The same person?
A|Yes.
M|I'm
A|Ooh, yes. And your kids all ski?
M|I've heard it's one of the most beautiful things in the world.
A|and it was very different it was a whole,  different view. It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know, at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that because I'd really never met people that did, and now, I talk to people that do. So that's, it's really interesting.
M|I'm in the valley, it's
A|Yeah, why, I don't know, I, I think they're kind of nice to have, they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to, I don't know, when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like, I don't know, something giving you some affection as well.
M|...
A|Uh-huh.
M|Uhhh, I, uh, I don't know.
A|Really? I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but, um, I understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers. I know George Bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground and that, um, yeah , I heard a joke on the radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system, and, uh, the radio's kind of cruel, I mean, think, the, he, this chain that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground, I mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man. I don't care if you're President.
M|I'll be her friend.
A|yeah, we, uh, she's, uh, into aerobics, and, uh, and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
M|I, uh, what?
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|Uh-huh.
M|I know, it's just... I don't know, I don't really know.
A|And, uh, so they come here and they don't know what the heck they're doing. And they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities. And, of course, there are people in the big cities who would do, like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
M|That's just, like, your opinion, man.
A|Right.
M|yes
A|Uh,
M|He didn't expect you to come back.
A|Okay.
M|You know, I voted for a lot of the local candidates.
A|yeah, now, Dallas is a I'm being very sarcastic, it's just a great,  uh,  on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,
M|...
A|I think that'd be an interesting experience. But, uh, I haven't done that
M|Food.
A|Sounds like a place where I grew up
M|I
A|Yeah.
M|We're all in a bath.
A|But they're not that much fun, you know, you can't take them for a walk, you can't, you know, they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
M|Yeah, uhuh.
A|I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
M|I'm sorry
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's a game, man.
A|because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know
M|And we have the two most important gun rights in the world.
A|I, I don't either. It's a really delicate, uh, moral, issue. Because, if you have, well, I guess the one thing I do see that is, is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, I do feel you have a certain obligation to,  to get them on their feet.
M|I
A|I've heard all these stories about, I travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in Europe every year,
M|I thought it was just the federal government that allowed guns to be purchased and sold in the state of Florida.
A|Uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder
M|...
M|I didn't play it
