A|Yes, we snow ski. We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon,
M|and.
A|Oh.  Uh-huh.
M|But he's an ex cop.
A|Well, most families, most families are young and both people are working.
M|I remember that, right, right
A|Um, and it's, it's, I, I couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until I, until I met with them. And I realized that, they, some of the information that I just, you know, don't even realize and know is information, they don't have. And I never thought, well, I guess that is something you need to know, you know. People getting into trouble because they come here, and so they start farming on, uh, available land, you know. Like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it. But then someone comes along and says you can't do that, you know. Why can't they? They have no idea why not, some, some of them, you know. The ones that have been here longer and have been in, you know, understand now. But when they initially come over,
M|What do you mean?
A|And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
M|I have a kid
A|Oh.
M|Do you have a problem?
A|Yeah.
M|Yeah, and the food is so small.
A|Right. Well, I, I guess I just have not read I mean, usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,
M|.
A|And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
M|I had a lot
A|I think so, and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.
M|
A|Yeah.
M|Oh, uhuh?
A|Yes, they will.
M|.the.very.very.
A|Uh-huh.
M|The east Texas school of engineering has a very large enrollment.
A|Well, he they, they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit
M|I
A|Oh, you are?
M|You
A|Uh, probably no.
M|And the jury will decide that.
A|or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.
M|Well, I know what I'm doing with my life.
A|Really?
M|...
A|Because it's all geothermal.
M|
A|and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
M|Oh, well, I guess that's how you feel.
A|Uh-huh.
M|That's right.
A|Uh-huh.
M|But you can play golf in the woods
A|In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that, you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house, but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have
M|It's all about the sugar in ketchup.
A|Yeah.
M|That's why we don't have them.
A|Sounds like a lot of money though
M|I'm not seeing you
A|and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
M|
A|I think some of them would rather be in jail
M|I work at a grocery store.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
M|I don't think I've ever seen a good game of pool in my life.
A|Huh. Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place. I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
M|That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't want to be a bad guy.
A|Yeah.
M|She's uh, in a good shape.
A|It's like a slap on the fingers for them.
M|It's not in my state.
A|Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
M|It's the only song I have in my playlist, it's a little sad.
A|But these people obviously weren't.
M|It's not like you could find evidence of him being a suspect or anything
A|Yeah. Yeah, I would think, I would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too.
M|No, they don't. The seeds go in the tomatoes.
A|More lax?
M|Well, you can have a steak and a beer.
A|Yeah.
M|
A|Is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes , we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.
M|I have a friend who's a lawyer, he's going to sue you for this.
A|Oh, yes, but we try, you know, I try, my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does
M|I love you too
A|Uh-huh. That's right.
M|You mean like, you make products?
A|Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
M|He gave you a copy of the book.
A|Oh.
M|I'm sorry, how much did you make?
A|No I don't know I guess the symbolism oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.
M|So, you're saying, he wanted to be friends with you?
A|Uh-huh.
M|No, I mean, I am not sure about the middle east, but I do know that there is no reason to go to Syria.
A|Well, I like it.
M|I
A|Uh-huh. Yeah. You get, it back, yeah.
M|We're gonna make a green bowl.
A|Yeah.
M|yes, it's.
A|Uh-huh.  Yeah, and I'm from Pittsburgh so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other
M|i, I think,
A|Yes. Uh-huh. They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
M|
A|Yeah, that's true.
M|They get a lifetime in jail.
A|This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, actually this fall, I was talking about, two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
M|Fun.
A|Yes, we've got about five of those. I love them.
M|I think you should get rid of capital punishment.
A|Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that I know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
M|How do you find it?
A|Yeah, Right.
M|Yeah, I've never used the water pump, but I've heard that you can use the pump to get out the water.
