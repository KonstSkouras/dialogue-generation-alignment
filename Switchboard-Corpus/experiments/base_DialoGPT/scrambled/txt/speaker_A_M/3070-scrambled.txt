A|About quality.
M|You like some country?
A|And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
M|I'em
A|And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, and they both enjoy it. So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
M|I
A|Yes.
M|They would be in the hospital.
A|Uh-huh. Sure.  Uh-huh.
M|That's back.
A|Hey, oh. Well, my, well my oldest is eight and, and she's, we've, started her on piano so, uh,
M|I'm a violinist, and I play a violin.
A|Oh. Oh, okay, so,
M|Do you have a problem with the others?
A|and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.
M|I have time
A|Uh-huh.
M|yeah, I'm.
A|Um, I forget how she got it, but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it, I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department.
M|I don't think so, but I'm not sure.
A|Yes. They,
M|I have never heard of a garage.
A|Uh-huh.
M|ohhh yeah.
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
M|I was joking, I don't think that's the case.
A|Yeah, I, I was called once, but I was out of the country, and apparently I, apparently they thought I served so I didn't, I didn't make any noise about it I came back and they said the record showed I served, but I was out of the country at the time, so I'm pretty sure I didn't. Uh,
M|He nods.
A|Yeah
M|I bet they are
A|and, you know, I would get hung up by my boot straps if I if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family.
M|No, I was the coach.
A|Uh-huh. Oh, that's great. Long as it's not raining.
M|I'm the... You...?
A|Uh-huh.
M|What is unsweet tea?
A|Uh, we've got plenty, in fact, we've got far too many. You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?
M|Why did you say it?
A|Yeah, yeah.
M|Neil.
A|Uh, yeah, exactly.
M|And so I said to them
A|have you ever been there?
M|I'm going to make a joke about it. I'm going out on a limb and saying that this is a Victorian shop.
A|Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
M|No. Yes.
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's the same as the rest of the world.
A|No, your, I have a friend now that has seven. And, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
M|The fish
A|Well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes, of course you're going to lose some that way
M|Well, you're welcome
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm not a monster.
A|you know. So I just go, you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there, you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
M|... I don't think I've ever seen a picture of him in my life.
A|um, um, but it just, work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,
M|Uhh.
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's ok.
A|Everybody says that
M|You know, it's kind of cool.
A|We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
M|I play tennis
A|And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in, they were all completely clean,
M|You
A|Yeah.
M|But you don't need to worry about the cat.
A|In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news
M|...
A|But very true to life, I mean, I've seen our family in several of those situations
M|Well, we do have a few of the top ten hospitals in the country.
A|Oh, oh.
M|That's a thing.
A|Yeah.
M|Is that a thing?
A|Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
M|That was great.
A|Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
M|The US has no problem with this, and it's not a business
A|Uh-huh.
M|And I thought we had a power outage
A|Cause I haven't been there probably ...
M|I,
A|I don't know. I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.
M|I don't think so.
A|Well, that's great that you all can work that out.  That's really good.
M|I
A|That's right. Yeah.
M|So I have that feeling that the freon price will increase...
A|I was, that's exactly what I was going to ask you. Have you ever, have, have you been downtown
M|What is your problem?
A|Huh.
M|I
A|Uh-huh.
M|Well, I hope you get to serve on the jury.
A|Uh-huh.
M|i
A|Uh-huh.
M|I've been told to not drive a car for several years now.
