A|Uh-huh. That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
M|Awww, I was so sad when I saw the sign.
A|Uh, but,
M|Why? It's a good idea.
A|And in talking to the people from France he said, you know, he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is. And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
M|What about Dallas?
A|whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,
M|I know, right?
A|'cause they're farmers. These,  are all farmers coming over,
M|It's, uh, uh like, that, that's, that
A|but, but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, I, it's hard to say. Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better.
M|I don't think it's real.
A|No, the times I've been out deer hunting, I, I can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
M|i
A|but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
M|Where are we
A|You know, it's just, but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her. She's down in Temple
M|I'm not.
A|Yeah, that's, that's what ours are too.
M|I wonder how much money they pay to the judge.
A|Oh, I had fondue. That was easy to say
M|The best of the best.
A|Is it really?
M|I have seen it in Raleigh.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|Not sure if you're joking, but I have a friend who plays piano.
A|Oh.
M|I live in Brazil, it's just a tourist place in the middle of nowhere.
A|Yeah. I mean, and and in the, once you junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels. Well, no, I guess it in junior high, it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. Uh, which,
M|You know, we have a lot of friends in this city,
A|Oh, yeah. I, I think it's a wonderful thing to do. And there's a lot, there's a lot more, I guess another possible solution is, since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and, and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it, uh,  more of the volunteer network service.
M|... and...
A|I think he's dead now, but he plays wonderfully.
M|Oh, no, it's just... We have the same tree.
A|They will, they will eventually. Okay, well it was nice talking with you.
M|I don't, I'm just saying it's the cheapest in the world, but,
A|Right.
M|I think the only way to fix it is to have it run the program, and then not fix it.
A|Oh, really?
M|yeah, say, that, you're, to be a problem,
A|My wife and I, you know, as mentioned, the question was, uh, do you get it from people too. And, and, I can say the same thing you do that, uh, my wife is, uh, she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and say, you didn't read the, uh, well, I always read the sports, uh, what am I thinking of, uh, the commentaries, I can't even think of what it is offhand, and she's always reading something, and she says, why haven't you read that. And, I say, I never have time to read it like you do. But, I always get a lot of my information from the, newspaper through her.
M|I am, it's fine.
A|and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.
M|I'm pretty sure they have to be convicted.
A|it will be whole. You'll be able to read  off of it.
M|Good luck with that.
A|My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping. So that just kind of works out real well.
M|It's a joke.
A|Uh-huh.
M|The.Joke.About.This.
A|The Utah Jazz.
M|...
A|Uh-huh.
M|I love dogs, but I hate dogs.
A|Yeah.
M|Ahh, uh huh.
A|would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.
M|You.
A|isn't that correct.
M|I was in China
A|So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
M|Why do
A|I mean it was amazing.
M|
A|Good.
M|That's a long time to wait for them to explore the house.
A|Yes.
M|we have a lot of them
A|No. I don't, I did it by hand,
M|you.
A|Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music, or do, is it talk shows.
M|Uhm... no.
