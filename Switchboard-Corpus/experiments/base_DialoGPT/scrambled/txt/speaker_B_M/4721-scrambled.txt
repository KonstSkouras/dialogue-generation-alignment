B|Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
M|
B|that, that's really sad, you know, you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and, no remorse, what so ever.
M|
B|oh duh, duh, duh you know,
M|We'll be getting a few recruits in the spring, but they're a little out of the loop.
B|yeah, fluid resistance.
M|How long is the waiting time?
B|Yeah.  Now what about you, if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get
M|Well, that's a bit of a different story.
B|They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.
M|How do I get the answers to my questions?
B|I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here, but.
M|I know.
B|Do you work, do you work for Texas Instruments then?
M|What are you talking about?
B|Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
M|I know.
B|Yeah, it's, it really is but, and she, she drives us
M|So, we're like the'do'thing, right?
B|Uh-huh.
M|You'll be fine.
B|It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was and now, she's stuck with it.
M|They're, they're
B|Yeah I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money or, what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people, I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,
M|... well, I'm a little bit older than you, and my parents are dead.
B|It just really gets way, when it gets way too hot
M|well, we do, we've been in texas before
B|You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.
M|I know, but you have no idea how much it cost to get it to grow
B|Oh.
M|He nods. So what do you want?
B|Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury.  That, that, that right
M|That's pretty cool, I'd love to do that.
B|It's It's very easy to do.
M|You mean they have to go to school to get the grades they want to go into.
B|Yeah.
M|Why?
B|they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
M|Yes, you do.
B|I I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.
M|And the Bears.
B|Yeah.
M|You
B|Yeah. I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York,
M|I love you.
B|So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant, you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.
M|Uh, what?
B|I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
M|And,
B|Midnight.
M|So, did you have a choice?
B|Oh, my heaven.
M|what?
B|We just lived up there.
M|Yeah, the number is a bit high.
B|Inconvenient, even
M|Yup, I have a few, and they are awesome.
B|Yeah, I guess so. It really sounds like it was fun.
M|.u'
B|Uh-huh.
M|Ummow
B|and at least I had some interest in, a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are, they say oh, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer. Why? Because they make a lot of money.
M|I'm sure it was.
