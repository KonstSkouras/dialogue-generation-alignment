B|Yeah. I, uh, those onions, I think, we, we planted like twice as much this year because, you know, we got, onions and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like October,
M|You have some problems.But you are a good boy.
B|It is just a real pain, or, you know, if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.
M|I've never met a dog that could do that.
B|So it's real neat.
M|I know
B|Oh, okay, because I grew up in North Hollywood, California went to U C L A and all that.
M|It's not a place, it's a city.
B|Huh, yeah.
M|That
B|Real good.
M|TIL there are people in Philadelphia
B|Bye-bye.
M|And, while it's still good, it's not reliable.
B|Yes.
M|I'm not saying it's okay.I just think it is a little too
B|Uh-huh.   Yeah.  Well the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. I mean, I can handle people, people selling drugs, you know, it's, it's wrong, but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for. But we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
M|What?
B|you can't help it's like, it's like a kid.
M|Well, uh, there's
B|Yeah.
M|That's what I thought.
B|And, they, they, have a, you, a good appetite
M|Well, that's not good.
B|because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. She just,
M|Yeah. I'm sorry.
B|Yeah, in their own community, right. Yeah, that's true Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
M|
B|but it's comfort. Uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. Uh,
M|.and,.
B|And, uh, just, it wasn't even a, a full tent. It would be more a tarp, uh strung up between trees
M|We do, we have the same problem
B|Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person. I had, I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right?
M|... where's the strip?
B|I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh, I'm with the university actually
M|I'm not sure if this is a joke or not, but I'm pretty sure it is.
B|Uh-huh.
M|yeah, they are in jail.
B|Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, so he could buy us material things.
M|I'm about.
B|Yep.
M|I think it's fine.
B|You, too, and I hope everything works out up there.
M|Well, I'm not a car guy, but I'm willing to take a small loan.
B|And this is before I was born.
M|It's a thing.It's a thing.
B|Well, it might be a good time for you to to, to start a tradition.
M|She has a small nose.
B|Uh-huh.
M|You, uh, you
B|Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall. It's,  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,
M|This is, what, the, what?
B|Um, I'm done, where I work.
M|I want to eat it.
B|but the rest of the time she's free. She likes to sew and do crafts and things like that So she enjoys staying at home, but, uh, the money part of it is not as rewarding, obviously, but there's different rewards, you know, different kinds of rewards.
M|And it's always good to be home
B|Well, uh, okay. Now that's inside again, right?
M|I'm pretty good
B|and that's it.  And we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made it.
M|Hehehe's.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|I've never heard of a black turtle.
B|And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.
M|I just made some rice noodles and it looks like rice noodles.
B|Ugh, ugh.
M|That's a lot easier to do than you think it is.
B|is talking to someone in Sorry.
M|I think there are much more people with guns than people with penny, penny ante.
B|But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy
M|adays
B|Oh yes, absolutely nuts. But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and,
M|He has a friend who is like, 25 and he's the best friend he's ever had.
B|Oh I see  Oh, gosh.
M|And here I am, in the US, where it's like the first time you've seen a baby, you know, before.
B|they're much more responsible. I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,
M|You can eat meat.
