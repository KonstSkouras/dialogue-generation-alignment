A:	Wow, yeah.
M:	Ohio. I've lived in the UP since I was in high school.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	There's no reason to be scared.
A:	And, yes, you're right, I think it's a sixties program. I think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he, that was his big deal.
M:	Hm, yeah.
A:	Um, but it's a beautiful home and, I mean, my brother lives,
M:	I'm going to be there, but I'm not going to
A:	I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.
M:	It was nice meeting you too
A:	Yeah. Well it's that they I think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and I uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that Uh, though I would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself I I I think uh you know but I I still what the flag stands for I guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh
M:	Why do you hate free?
A:	Okay, okay. Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
M:	Yes, I'm a student.
A:	There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course, but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
M:	i think you mean like, you have to be a volunteer for the school, not a community member
A:	and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad, you you know, this is nothing, and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but I actually, I mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,
M:	Uhhh, I know, I'm just gonna go sit in my chair and wait for the next one.
A:	Well, my wife and I and we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet.
M:	They did.
A:	What part, what sections are they in? Yeah, that's nice.
M:	Sorry.
A:	Huh.
M:	Oh? I see.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	He got out?
A:	Oh, wow.
M:	I don't get it.
A:	He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
M:	So, you want me to give you a clue?
A:	Do you have a lawn?
M:	I'm not from Europe.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I don't like the shape of that.
A:	Right. Right. Um, I think I, I've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're, they're pretty good, along those lines as compared to what I have seen from other people's children and grandchildren, mine aren't really that bad,
M:	Yes.it.is.that
A:	Oh yeah.
M:	no.
A:	Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.

A:	Okay, thanks.
M:
