A:	Yeah.
M:	I know it was
A:	Yeah, yeah, I was, left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,
M:	Alright then. Bye.
A:	I think that's coming and I think once, once people really start to communicate how they feel, things are going to change. Until then, I think, you know, it's going to be really painful. So the question is, how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth and, as you said, it's how soon we get involved, and I think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved, like allowing us to call a toll free number and say, hey, look, do it this way, not that way, or I like this, or I don't like that, or this is how I feel about your spending my money on art that I don't think is art.
M:	
A:	Uh, got, you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
M:	You've heard The Richardson Symphony?
A:	so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting, and I'm enjoying it. I'm around my kids
M:	Uhh, I think that's an extreme situation.
A:	and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest. Now it's, and people say, well, you know, I'm making money by using this credit card, but they don't realize that if they, I mean, it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest, I mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,
M:	We have, uh, five bedrooms, so we can have a room.
A:	Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. Um, and the luxuries of a large car.
M:	It
A:	And, and I was trying to get my son to sing that. My husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song But, they, they do a lot of fun things. I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. Because you know there's just,
M:	we.
A:	I hope we're called up before too long.
M:	Why would anyone donate to a charity?
A:	Oh, well that's interesting.
M:	Oh, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	But it, but again, it depends on what job you're in.
M:	it is the first time,
A:	So,
M:	I don't think
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order. And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person. You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
M:	You could have saved up a few thousand dollars.
A:	So,
M:	That's why I use my own spreadsheet
A:	That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden so I had, I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
M:	I have no idea.
A:	That's, that's been my impression.
M:	You
A:	It really makes an effort on, to, do this anymore.
M:	Like, a golden retriever?
A:	Oh, I think that's wonderful.
M:	They are.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death. I mean,  most people out there committing murders don't care.
M:	c'?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	He's there to get out of jail.
A:	that's going to take up what you would have made.
M:	I, and, right.
A:	And that's, you know, that's the way they wanted to do it. And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, uh, you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.
M:	I would be so mad.
A:	I don't think I would go through that expense. One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours
M:	Uh huh.
A:	Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.
M:	..
A:	Well, I am a travel agent at heart, and my hobby is just, I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh, but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband, so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
M:	.
A:	Yeah.
M:	What do you think of the new policy?
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
M:	No, I was the teacher for the high school.
A:	Yeah, you have to
M:	Heh, yeah.
A:	Yeah, small world. So, I, uh, I know Chris
M:	That's the scary part.
A:	Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.
M:	It's not the money that's the problem, it's the people who work and get paid.
A:	Yeah, we had, uh, I don't know, my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so, you know, and he's sit in front of it and, and he went by and he said, Whoops, and he backed up, and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,
M:	I mean, I'm a little nervous about the weather too.
A:	Uh-huh.  Yes.
M:	Yea. Yeah.
A:	There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
M:	You can see the little shelf for the back of the shop in the picture.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You're welcome.
A:	but it's uncomfortable
M:	u
A:	And the government really plays a role in this.
M:	We're in College station
A:	or, you know semi .
M:	What about it?
A:	and I enter things in our little state fair, and that's pretty fun.
M:	Well, they did the same thing with the cat.
A:	Exactly.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh my god.
A:	Yeah Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
M:	Oh, you're a cook, huh?
A:	and we just moved here, uh, we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate, and then we were transferred back here, and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,
M:	you might get more thorough, umm, from TV
A:	Yeah, so it's been good for our family.
M:	I've been to a few weddings, they were great.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And the most beautiful yellow flowers.
A:	Yeah. Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
M:	What?
A:	Oh, if you had it early.
M:	So. Where do you live?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I am going to be out of town for a few days.
A:	Whoops
M:	They do a LOT of things that we don't.
A:	Oh, yeah?
M:	What kind of stuff?
A:	Haven't been there, I keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and,
M:	I was just thinking about that, I think it would be a good idea to have them in the school, and then some.
A:	Yeah that would be a good idea.
M:	i
A:	I don't know. Huh. * See note above
M:	
A:	I guess it, it, might would,
M:	I'm sorry you have to play golf
A:	I enjoyed speaking with you
M:	That's a good point.
A:	They're on the increase in this area.
M:	...
A:	worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
M:	Oh?
A:	Um.
M:	The ability to move
A:	No, usually in the summer time.
M:	It's not.
A:	I was going to say, my sister wasn't spoiled very much.
M:	He was found innocent.
A:	Yeah.
M:	They should get their own college credit.
A:	That's funny. Where is he from in France? Uh-huh.
M:	Well, you can just see the picture of the tree...
A:	Yeah.
M:	I can't be the only one who noticed the lack of the word'appeal '.
A:	Right, research triangle and all of that.
M:	That's, like, your opinion, man.
A:	Yeah, yeah, she's the, she's the nice one. We, uh, we used to live in an apartment and like, our cats never went outside, but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out, and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy, and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in
M:	I don't think so.
A:	and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
M:	I'm guessing they are from a lab, but the fact that they have that much hair, I'm guessing it's a lab.
A:	Well, he's from here.
M:	I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
A:	Who makes that car?
M:	
A:	and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything, so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.
M:	I'm not sure if it's a choice or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I live in Texas.
A:	Oh, okay, your talking about
M:	h
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's a lot of dirt.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, yeah, you do.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hopefully so.That's good.But.So.Bad.But.
A:	Right, in that particular instance, uh, but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a and all and be all,
M:	I
A:	I do have friends who have tried to do more,  social work,   you know, by explaining to people how the language,  and what the problems learning English might be and such.
M:	It's an honor to get the second.
A:	so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,
M:	
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
M:	You know, got some.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I mean, we usually do.
A:	Right.
M:	I have a feeling this is gonna be a long story
A:	oh, yeah. I guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that. But, um, I guess it's because I'm older, I mean, I'm not real old but I am older and, um, you know, I didn't feel like that I didn't feel like I had to have everything. I guess it was because, well, I had everything when I was at home but I, I don't know why I didn't.
M:	They're not going to come in because they have no problems.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Uhhuhuh. And.
A:	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
M:	They do.
A:	Right.
M:	I know.you'll never know.
A:	Emmett Smith, yeah.
M:	Uhm. I think you need to pickle your own.
A:	So the first, you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
M:	How did you feel when you saw the news?
A:	so.
M:	I can't say I've ever heard of a home builder.
A:	It's that's no problem here. Yeah, we really liked it up there but then
M:	No, it's all fair
A:	Not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,
M:	I built a sun room out of a sun.
A:	I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.
M:	...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	you, i'm
A:	Um.
M:	It's
A:	Where there's a will,  where there's a will, there's a way, right?
M:	Ah, well I'm just a little bit jealous.
A:	first one, you know how that is. And, um, uh, I play the guitar and a banjo. I mainly play the guitar a lot, I play about every night. And, um, I really love that, if I had a druther , if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something, because that's, I've,
M:	
A:	but, uh,
M:	
A:	Uh, she's,
M:	They made some kind of funny looking onion ring,
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	Oh yeah.
A:	Uh I think that's what's made democracy
M:	Do you know that the word'i'is'a'word?
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
M:	I know.
A:	Yeah But I think I I Yeah I I I guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers. Um. there uh one of the Republican the appointees for the the judicial bench and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.
M:	Uh, I'm not a diver.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, that's right.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	I'm not even a girl.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I've always wondered why I've never seen any windows in my house.
A:	Right. Right, probably more of them then the other way around Interesting. I don't, I don't, not sure I, I'm in Washington, D C or at least very close to it. I'm not sure what kind of, uh, capital punishment we have here.
M:	He's pretty good.
A:	No. Yeah, I think so. I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious. You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
M:	You can't
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I'm in Georgia.
A:	Okay, take care.
M:	So, is that a question?
A:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, well, I hope you have a nice weekend.
A:	Yes. But still, it came up though, didn't it,
M:	You know what?
A:	Oh definitely.
M:	I have it's for?
A:	but it seems like here, I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
M:	He is the best.
A:	Oh Lord.
M:	Not in the sun.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It is, but I don't think it's old.
A:	Yes and,
M:	
A:	so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.
M:	Well, uh, and.
A:	and I just, I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful.
M:	C
A:	And, um, I'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too, so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
M:	I like windows.
A:	Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
M:	Yeah, she is. She is a doctor.
A:	I wonder now in, and I've been out of school too long to answer this, but I wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
M:	Er,
A:	And then,
M:	How?
A:	Yes.
M:	So, it's freezing.
A:	Sure, sure.
M:	You don't know who he is?
A:	Are you going up toward, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M, Bradford, no that's too far north.
M:	I'm not sure. I don't know if you are saying that or what you mean by that.
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.
M:	She's a golden retriever
A:	Anyway, do you have a pet?
M:	No, they were talking about the crimes.
