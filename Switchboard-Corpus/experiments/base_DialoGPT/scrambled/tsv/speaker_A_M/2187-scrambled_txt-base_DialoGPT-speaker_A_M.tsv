M:	he smiles and shrugs
A:	If, if, if I had the car I wanted.
M:	
A:	And so, one day I got up and thought well I will just go casual and you know that I called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional

M:	I'm
A:	and I did it, um, for one reason I wanted, I was working on a masters degree so I wanted to stay close to where I was working on a masters degree, but also because I just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
