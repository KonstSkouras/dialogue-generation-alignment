A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a joke
A:	Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places. But our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.
M:	She's just... ugh.
A:	Well, I'll let you go it's,
M:	A few months of it.
A:	and I'm Brian.
M:	They'll be back, just like they were when I got here.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I think the cowboys are pretty good
A:	You know. Twenty-five, I don't know. Twenty-five percent? A asks someone else in the Yeah, my wife was big in that
M:	Where are you from?
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
M:	I'm a little confused.
A:	Yep.
M:	It's not.
A:	I don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. I really, don't know.
M:	It's been raining for like 3 days now.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a law in most of the countries, so it's a big problem.
A:	Yes, I've for the first time we planted them this year.
M:	I'm not sure, I have no idea.
A:	Um, you know, I'm not sure, I'm not positive, I didn't, I didn't really think about that. I just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper. But, not that I'll ever go. I hadn't been to a Cowboys game, time, last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that, um, N F L strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there, and it was the, uh, Dallas and Washington Redskins game. And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets, and they, um, if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else. So my dad, I went with my dad to a game that one time. But that wasn't a real, you know, it was, it was the scab teams, it was kind of, you know, it was kind of different, I guess. And before that it's been quite a few years. I've been wanting to go to a game, I just never, never have gotten around to it. So maybe this year .
M:	Did you go to the great barrier reef?
A:	Yeah, it, and it if you, um, well, first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat.
M:	Nope.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That and, and
A:	About fifteen miles. I live in a little suburb, uh, which is, I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
M:	They were just trying to get the deer to go into the city.
A:	Yes. When is yours on?
M:	no, i am not,
A:	Yeah.
M:	Does it? I mean, if you want to fund it, it would.
A:	Time, uh-huh. Yes. I was, I would just be, I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
M:	We're all gonna make it brah
A:	but it's not going to, Oh, I see.
M:	
A:	Exactly.
M:	Avengerm, is a mod
A:	Right. Yeah. Uh huh.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	It's just one story. Yeah. It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
M:	But he doesn't bite anyone.
A:	and we ended up with them, right. And so we were, walking up
M:	What are the people who do the work?
A:	Okay.
M:	This is the only time in history that we have had news that happened.
A:	Oh, I'm so sorry. But that's good that you're going to get another one.
M:	What's wrong with classical music?
A:	and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.
M:	I agree. I'd rather be poor than have a high cost of living.
A:	Oh, really.
M:	American?
A:	Okay, well, there's, uh, it's kind of an interesting topic and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh, not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know, you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World, and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned, and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period. We're also have a very humongous trade deficit, and, uh, and that's kind of frightening. Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life, and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime, and so I think, uh, you know, things, there's been an awful lot of social change lately, and and, uh.
M:	I'm sorry to hear that.
A:	And I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have, oh, I'll have less of a bug problem at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
M:	Spanish is a dialect of English, not a language.
A:	Okay.   Well,
M:	She does.
A:	She has twelve children.
M:	I don't really have any of those.
A:	Yeah, I guess so that's true.  Yeah.
M:	I'm in Utah and it's not.
A:	I mean, it's worked successfully in Europe.
M:	I
A:	They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
M:	Yeah, and there's...
A:	Wow. All that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour.
M:	Are you in this picture?
A:	Wow.
M:	How do you know about that?
A:	It feels, after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house, they know everything.
M:	Oh, um, yeah, er...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Your mother has cats?
A:	Okay.
M:	Uhh uh uh huh
A:	Kind of like the cowboys, huh.
M:	uhh.uhuh.uh
A:	Oh,
M:	Yeah, we have a lot of fun in music too
A:	And it's a real big crunch, uh
M:	They were the most popular, and they were the first to be popular
A:	Yeah, I find it surprising. Because a lot of times, it, here, you know, I'll talk to some people here and I'll mention someone's, some talk host and I'll expect them to have an opinion on why I don't like him and don't listen, they don't even know, you know, what the guys name is, uh. Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States. Most people haven't heard of Bruce Williams. You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.
M:	Do you mean carpool?
A:	Huh. Well, that's, Well, that sounds interesting. Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
M:	My cat. She's a big one.
A:	But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,
M:	He's got the uhhhhh.
A:	and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.
M:	How many of those are from the towns?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I am so glad you were able to
A:	You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
M:	
A:	I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard. I, I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard,
M:	Well, the trial is a bit of a stretch.
A:	Can I put you on hold for one minute?
M:	Yeah, and they eat the tomatoes
A:	Oh.
M:	It's a song.
A:	See, that's we've we had a problem with that.
M:	Why do you hate the red lobster?
A:	I did too, and you have a good day.
M:	He has dysplastic
A:	Yeah,
M:	You know.
A:	Well it, I, I agree with you there because I know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
M:	It's not that hard. They just don't have the power to do it.
A:	it's not really just to getting to sight see.
M:	I'll go fishing for you're fishing, you, fishing, they're fishing.
A:	Oh, huh.
M:	I think I'm gonna be a bit of a hoot
A:	Right.
M:	You would think they would be able to.
A:	How far out from the city, I mean, do you,
M:	I do believe.
A:	Oh.
M:	The neighborhood?
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	...
M:	What was the school?
