A:	Uh-huh.
M:	uh
A:	Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
M:	They do, but I'm not sure about how much they're worth.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	Nope, why nothink
A:	Yeah.
M:	I, uh, I think I know what you mean.
A:	And it played by itself?
M:	
A:	People get shipped off and then, you know, and then, and then their parents, I have a, uh, a, a friend whose, whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now.
M:	I like the way you think.
A:	So.
M:	the.
A:	Of course not.
M:	They're not really a side shows, they're more of a cult.
A:	Yeah, can you believe it, that's just, uh,
M:	s.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	... I, I'm confused.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, I don't like stickshift.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
M:	
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	You are.
A:	Oh, good.
M:	It's a business.
A:	Well, the, course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever, so they're giving the early release, uh,
M:	They got lucky with that first round exit.
A:	Makes a lot of difference.
M:	I'm a lot of fun.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	What is your major crime?
A:	I never have either, but my friends, my few friends who have, uh, say just the opposite They say they're, uh, remarkably incompetent. And, uh, don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to, to air, and all that.
M:	I
A:	And then where do you meet?
M:	uuhh, uuhh.
A:	They're up and doing fine.
M:	You,.
A:	Right.
M:	I don't have any ideas, I can you think of, u do, u,
A:	Seems like I just bought it.
M:	This is so confusing
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Rosebtwink
A:	Really.
M:	Oh. Well, I'll have to go see a doctor then.
A:	Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
M:	You can do that.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, I think you're right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh, what are you guys up to?
A:	Right.
M:	What's up?
A:	Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	I have a house, so I can live in it.
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
M:	Yeah, keep it
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We have a decent number of people from Utah
A:	Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
M:	I love stick shift.
A:	You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and, and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
M:	
A:	Yes. And that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two, so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
M:	How much would it cost?
A:	uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I was thinking.
A:	That's, uh, only way to do it.
M:	She laughs. What do you mean, then?
A:	I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
M:	No, huhuhuhuhuuhuh
A:	Right.
M:	The,
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	That's a good point. I just wanted to point out that a lot of people aren't even aware of the fact that they can get up to five dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Is that a serious problem?
A:	Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
M:	So you agree with that.
M:	You guys ever have a fight in the middle of the night?
