M:	I've never seen it,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I live in a neighborhood that is a couple hundred miles away from the neighborhood that the neighborhood is in.

M:	Uhhhhh... huh?

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, well I'm not sure, I was thinking of the same people who are now in charge of the new map.
B:	But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them

M:	Do you listen to anything else?
B:	I'm sorry for these beeps,
M:	They do, but it takes a while.
