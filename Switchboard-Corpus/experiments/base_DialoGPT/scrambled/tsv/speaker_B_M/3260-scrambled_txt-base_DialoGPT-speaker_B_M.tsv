B:	Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself. That you've just got to   you've just got to
M:	That's true.
B:	Yes. Absolutely.
M:	You're not?
B:	Yeah. Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care, it's not because the punishment, but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
M:	What?
B:	and so they say, well, this is, you know, I, I don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever, but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
M:	Right.
B:	yeah, those are pretty good but true to life,
M:	You know, you do.
B:	And electric windows, and power locks
M:	Uhh... why not?
B:	Yeah, but that one's an easy one. It's like, just put in, a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine
M:	Australia?
B:	I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who I am so,
M:	The Cowboys are gonna win the Super Bowl this year.
B:	I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.
M:	You know
B:	Yeah.
M:	It
B:	So,
M:	The, uh, you have, uh.. you have been, uh... banned from.
B:	My, my kids are all grown.
M:	Ours are sooo cute.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I',
B:	They really are. The cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog.
M:	Uhhhhh.
B:	Yeah
M:	It's an egg. I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well I was just joking.
B:	Exactly. You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
M:	I'm not sure if you can call it a problem
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	N
B:	Right.
M:	not.
B:	It comes from trees. How can it be bad?
M:	Well I mean, it's not like they're the ones that fight them.
B:	So,
M:	People are still extinct point and figure
B:	and why?
M:	I'm in California.
B:	Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.  Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.
M:	That's the thing.
B:	That's really true.
M:	You can't say that, you know.
B:	Oh, I see. How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?
M:	uhhh, yeah, uh, but...
B:	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
M:	I mean... it is the New Jersey Yankees...
B:	So, I mean, his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
M:	
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
M:	We,
B:	No, I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part. I mean that's, sex is rampant,
M:	It's like the Freon
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why don't you have a job?
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah..that.Who
B:	So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat, but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.
M:	What about the speed of the car?
B:	Huh.
M:	She's got an optician.
B:	yeah.
M:	Uuhh, I have a few radishes.
