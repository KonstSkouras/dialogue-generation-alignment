B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, yeah.
B:	Are you having any trouble with bugs in, in your garden?
M:	You know, I can go back and talk to my friends.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Not really. They're not a bad country.
B:	Right. So, I think we find out what's happening in the city, uh, on a fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
M:	I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying that it's not a simple matter of how many times we say it.
B:	Yeah,
M:	Oh, right.
B:	Oh, really
M:	I don't really, but, uh, I don't know what you're on about.
B:	His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for for her daddy,
M:	I'm in a relationship, I'm going to try to do it as soon as possible
B:	Small enough, you have a, just do it by hand?
M:	Well, they're a handful.
B:	Just started shooting people,  because they botched the first job
M:	Yes, but it's mostly for the camping.
B:	We don't use the radio as a wake up, we have our, a television connected to a, uh, uh, electronic alarm, uh, system that kicks in,
M:	Well, we have a camp.
B:	Right. Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
M:	Yeah, it's good.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure, I will.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	No. No, not at all.
M:	You pay a ton of property tax.
B:	Oh.
M:	he's a redditor.
B:	and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. It's, it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally
M:	They.
B:	What part of Pittsburgh?
M:	I'm not really a guy.
B:	Right.
M:	My house is slab.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	...
B:	Do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
M:	That's a weird way to spell me
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. I guess it's okay.
B:	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	I think you have to have been married a year or two before this
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I don't
B:	Yeah, I think so. I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
M:	It's a sad thing.
B:	You know, they buy a place and they just hate the area.
M:	Oh.
B:	It kind of crept in and,
M:	You know, the locals have a lot of people that live in the city.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yes
B:	No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.
M:	You.
B:	Yeah.  Yeah.
M:	That's, so.
B:	So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that, but I just thought I'd throw that in there
M:	I can't.
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on, on news that way. And, then we would do a similar thing, uh, at uh, ten forty-five because, uh, C N N would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage, uh, and then I think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would, would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. Uh, three of the networks here, on their local news, uh, that if, if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who, murdered who, or stole what. from whom.
M:	I've seen it too, it's a lot of things.
B:	It's not, not to me personally, no.
M:	You don't have a farm.
B:	Oh.
M:	How much money are you making?
B:	Um. Okay,  and did,
M:	I have a high school friend who has a job.
B:	I'm sold on Nissans.
