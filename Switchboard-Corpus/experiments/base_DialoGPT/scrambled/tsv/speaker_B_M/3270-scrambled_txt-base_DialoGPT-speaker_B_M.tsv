B:	Oh, the potato, They were, they're delicious but they, you don't get, seem to get that much for the space,
M:	A friend of mine is going to be there.
B:	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
M:	You know what? I'm not sure.
B:	So we're talking about second and third great children here.
M:	Uh, where are the people from?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it. Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
M:	You can also get the rear brake removed.
B:	Well, I really, the last car we got was a, was a used car. I really don't prefer buying a new car. I like to let somebody else pay for that
M:	Do you work for a company?
B:	What was that?
M:	Do we have a team?
B:	That's amazing, well, what's the difference there, do you know?
M:	I have a friend who plays it. It's fun.It's fun
B:	he was an, an assistant district attorney in Chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book, and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in Chicago, and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this, this guy is, you know, from here.
M:	So it was ok then?
B:	Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother I have three children and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young, I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.
M:	It's not that far from the beach.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Wait, who is the winner of the lottery?
B:	Well, I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real issues here. Um,  that I think, um,
M:	Because, I have no idea what you're talking about.
B:	I see.
M:	But, uh, I have to get rid of them.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You don't have to be a little kid to understand
B:	yeah, and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it Um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of O strip east to west, eastern part,
M:	I think that's the one.
B:	So it's pretty minimal.
M:	Uhh, we don't have a tree...
B:	Oh my God,  how do they live?
M:	And, I think, you know,
B:	You know, people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because  they don't have the clothes to wear.
M:	You... uh... you don't know?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's not.
B:	Always, yes ma'am.
M:	We
B:	Oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through. When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, and, I mean, a chiropractor got it in one time
M:	You're welcome.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	I'll keep an eye out for them.
B:	so, I don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live. Um, so, now, since, uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, um,
M:	You know what?
