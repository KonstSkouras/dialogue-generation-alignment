B:	Is that right?
M:	We're always here, you're just not.
B:	That's right
M:	I'm not really sure. I eat fish. I'm not sure if I eat a ton of fish.
B:	Right. Okay.
M:	Ahh, that's interesting. My son and I do the mow the grass.
B:	Oh, no.
M:	I've been to Morocco.
B:	In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.
M:	Why not?
B:	And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
M:	You have a house in a nice neighborhood and you live in a city. I don't think it matters.
B:	they have, um, the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to, keep them, yeah, keep them clean
M:	It's a conference.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	100.
B:	No.
M:	Well, they don t like it here, but they don't like to eat.
B:	Yes.
M:	I like to go outside
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think it's bad. It's a plant, so it's a tree.
B:	Yes, what a coincidence.
M:	I'm, the.
B:	Okay. Yes, I do
M:	Is that a thing?
B:	And if, if they know some practice is wrong, you know, I'm not talking about your isolated occurrences, I'm talking more about the, you know, the thing that they know, maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.
M:	Where do you live?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's neat.
B:	A lot of our words are the same,
M:	It's from the Minnesota Minnesota
B:	I think so.
M:	We don't have any objections.
B:	And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. That, you know, you, never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
M:	Why?
B:	Yeah, well, my, my oldest is only nine.
M:	North America
B:	Wow.
M:	Yes...
B:	And I, I really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.
M:	Hehehe, did it again!
B:	It was so funny to see, it was a really cute little kid too.
M:	She was almost a year old when we rescued her.
B:	so that's not so bad, you know.
M:	Yeah, but she didn't get the credit
B:	Yeah.
M:	Why do you ask?
B:	Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them.
M:	I
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	I can't even speak English right now.
B:	Not a thing, goodness gracious.
M:	It's a joke, because the United states is in the middle of the list.
B:	I've had a skunk
M:	I know who you are.
B:	Huh.
M:	I know right. I like to fiddle around in my garage.
B:	So, right now we're just,
M:	she
B:	Yeah.
M:	I,
B:	Oh, how neat.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	There's no question, I think that's really the best. If, if a woman is happy doing that,
M:	I don't think.
B:	Yeah
M:	She says, but she says no.
B:	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
M:	That's it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Why, because you know, they have all of their stuff of their selves.
B:	And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things.
M:	I'm just trying to make the house fit in.
B:	Yeah.
