M:	I think it was given by some friend, and they were just going to go hunting.
B:	I grow a lot of things, a lot of food.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	It's a little place, looks like a castle.
M:	How, I'm
B:	because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment. So,
M:	What kind of jobs do you have?
B:	Right. Some people, I mean, families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.
M:	They might.
B:	I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
M:	I
B:	Well it was nice talking to you too, I enjoyed it.
M:	Yeah, the lion.
B:	Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.
M:	You know what I like?
B:	And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them
M:	I'm aghas aghaf.
B:	Huh that's,
M:	Most sports cars have stickshift.
B:	We expected it to continue forever. I think they're doing pretty well this year though.

B:	Um.
M:	Yeah. But it's a bit of a shame
B:	but.
M:	I like dogs, they're cool.
B:	Right.
M:	They are the only ones that have been built.
B:	but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.
M:	I don't know. I'm not from the state of Mississippi.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I tell you that's sad too because there one time Ford was the best, that was made.
M:	You can be her caregiver.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The story of my life
B:	Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company. I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this
M:	You, New New York?
B:	Oh.
M:	No, it's the opposite.
B:	Wow.

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Oh, don't made any excuses for him
M:	He's also a great driver
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, we have a card.
B:	Right, right.
M:	They are in jail.
B:	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is the best timeline.
B:	I really do. I think it'd be better that way and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because  they know that that there are problems
M:	We
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You and they all of us
B:	I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,
M:	I don't know.But it's
B:	Heavy involvement from the public.
M:	I'm confused. How many playoff games have they won?
B:	I have two daughters.
M:	They were. They're still on the death row list.
B:	Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,

B:	and I don't have to concentrate too hard on them.
M:	I've been a Vikings fan since the Vikings were founded, I'm a Packers fan, and I'm not even a Vikings fans.
B:	And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
M:	Is this real?
B:	Okay.
M:	It's not that complicated, just make a little button for the button and drag it up.
B:	No? Didn't have shrimp there huh
M:	Is this one of the better ones?
B:	That's right.
M:	I think you've got the wrong impression.
B:	I don't know. It's an interesting problem. I happen to, um, I'm a pediatrician.
