M:	?
A:	and then when I would come home and he would leave, and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know, someone came home and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something. It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M:	
A:	And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. So there's one or two nights a week, we have a, on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening and we stay home that evening, all of us, and we do things together.
M:	no
A:	Yes.
M:	...
A:	Oh, you are?
M:	I'm not a monster.
A:	Yes and,
M:	You are.
A:	So you do that and, right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
M:	We can do a night's
A:	Right, and then, you know, sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but, We're, it's real important to us to spend time together.
M:	It's. Not.
A:	I have two.
M:	I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so sorry.
A:	Uh-huh. I have a girl and a boy, and the boy's five, he's in kindergarten, and the girl is four. She'll be in kindergarten next year. Uh-huh.
M:	I'll be her friend.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hmmmmmm... I have two.
A:	They are a handful.
M:	The only time I have ever been told that my kids are a lot of fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well uh, I have no kids.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What about her?
A:	Yes.
M:	Uuh, uh, she?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, uh, she's not dead
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Huehuehuhueh.
A:	Well, no, and it's, it's just not, um, it's not as stable for the kids,
M:	
A:	and they, everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. But, uh, it's, yeah.
M:	I think they're just not as funny as they used to be.
A:	Well, it's also important, I think, um, for my husband. I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, um, some time with them.
M:	Yes.
A:	So he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,
M:	I'm ahem.
A:	and he reads to them,
M:	he sits down, and I sit down
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that, and that's, that's pretty good quality time, with them,
M:	I don't know, but he spends hours reading,
A:	and, um, but it's hard for him on Saturdays. He, he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,
M:	He has to be, he's a lot of fun to watch.
A:	and so, um, I try to say, well, why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something.
M:	I, uh, don't think he's gonna, he's, uh... not a guy.
A:	And if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.
M:	... And then he, he wants, to go fly, and do something.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's your wife?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	They had a fun time running around and playing.
A:	Yes.
M:	Are they happy with your decision?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we did they have kids?
A:	Well, that's right. But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends are that, um, the family unit is devaluated. It's not nearly as important.
M:	You.
A:	We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
M:	I think.
A:	And families took care of themselves and, um, but now, you know, people don't, they don't support each other that way.
M:	The family, family, families.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know right?
A:	That's right and,
M:	That and, and
A:	Right, right,
M:	I don't, but I'm right.
A:	And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, I, you know, I have interests that, too,
M:	I'm not, but I'm the one who's asking.
A:	and it is hard to make, uh, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
M:	No, right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh. Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	I think.
A:	It is temporary. It, in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,
M:	It's
A:	but you're right, it is temporary. Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	That's true, but it's still temporary.
A:	and, and, in spite of,
M:	They are in the same house.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	well, it's a long shot, but it's always the best idea.
A:	Yes.
M:	Do they have any children?
A:	That's true.
M:	I've never heard of a single girl having a son or daughter.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know I'm just not sure about
A:	Yeah.
M:	He, just, with.
A:	Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
M:	Oh I know, I'm just saying that it's not as bad as I thought it would be.
A:	and,
M:	I'm sorry, but...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, my wife, uh, likes that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	uh, she works in the bathroom.
A:	Well, that's good.
M:	I'm not going to lie. She's not going back to work.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, uh, what's the deal with that?
A:	No. Yeah, I think so. I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious. You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
M:	Yes.
A:	Yes.
M:	I like.
