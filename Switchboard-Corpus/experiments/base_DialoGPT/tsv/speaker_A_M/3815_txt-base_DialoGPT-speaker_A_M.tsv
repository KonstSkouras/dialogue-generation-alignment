M:	What kind of car?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What kind of car?
A:	I see
M:	Uh, uh, I'm not sure.
A:	Top of, top of the line.
M:	How is this a thing?
A:	Oh.
M:	You're not my friend.
A:	Uh-huh. Right, right.
M:	No, it's not.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, what?
A:	Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that I know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
M:	Oh, well, I guess that's how you feel.
A:	And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work
M:	Why?
A:	And then I want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and I want an air bag and, uh, I guess,
M:	And that's, uh, it.
A:	No, I haven't. Have you?
M:	Have u ever?
A:	Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea
M:	I'm not sure, I have no idea.
A:	Right.
M:	You sure?
A:	Right, that's a good idea.
M:	I, actually, I like that idea.you know, because, uh, I think it'll, uh... save lives.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	How do you do it?
A:	Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands. I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh, and I needed air-conditioning and, uh, can't remember what my, oh, I wanted uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
M:	
A:	It, it turned out to be a, a Chrysler. Uh Lancer.
M:	No.
A:	Yeah.
M:	A.uh. Yeah, shift. shift.
A:	No, a five speed. And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
M:	Was it a three or four speed?
A:	So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
M:	It was a manual.
A:	Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one and I thought it would be more reliable.
M:	I'll.
A:	Uh,
M:	Why do you like the stick shift?
A:	I found that out. I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,
M:	I can't find any stick shift car that has a manual transmission.
A:	So,
M:	That's what I thought.
A:	Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore. At least in this area.
M:	I am.
A:	Not that I was looking for sports cars, but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
M:	I know the majority of people don't, but I'd be willing to drive a stick shift car if it meant driving manual.
A:	And so why do you like stick shift?
M:	I love stick shift.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, I don't like stickshift.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	It's like a car.
A:	Right, and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active.
M:	I like the idea of it, but I don't know, I'm not a very good pilot.
A:	So,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
