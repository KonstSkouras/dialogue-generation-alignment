A:	Yeah, that's pretty out there. What, well,
M:	I live in the US.
A:	Oh, okay, yeah, I got my brother and my whole family there. I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.

M:	Well, what's up?
A:	No, my husband does.
M:	Are you in texas?
A:	And who, how about you?
M:	Uhh, I do
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
M:	That's what I said.
A:	Well that's okay. I guess it's an easy thing to do. So you're you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?
M:	i know i'm just being a meanie.
A:	Oh, that's a, Those are beautiful.
M:	I'm so glad you found something to do, it's so peaceful.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... You?
A:	Yeah, is it a, is it a working farm or is it?
M:	Oh, is it?
A:	More, more, I can understand that, that's probably what I would, uh,
M:	You can't make a farm without a working, working farm.
A:	Yeah
M:	But... but... your garden?
A:	I can hear the accent now I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
M:	He's from the west.
A:	We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
M:	Wait... what?
A:	We, we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married
M:	What happened to you?
A:	and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh, and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
M:	Uh... and then, uh, we have a baby and we're married in Minneapolis.
A:	at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
M:	So uh, how did it go?
A:	and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
M:	Uh, you know what to do.uh?
A:	And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano, well, it's not little any more.
M:	He's, uh, living in a little place called Planos.
A:	Uh, yes, that's out near the airport. That's about forty-five miles from us.
M:	That's... a lot of drive
A:	It's, yeah, That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt? Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
M:	Yeah, yeah, ya, er, that's
A:	you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
M:	You have you,
A:	It really is, I mean we're, we're in a leased town home, and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
M:	.
A:	But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
M:	What's your apartment?
A:	and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
M:	You're right, it's probably your teeth.
A:	No.
M:	And you
A:	Yeah this is, it's like a duplex, like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
M:	Are you saying that the people in that area think they're living in the ghetto?
A:	And it's nice but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten, and now she can't sell it. And our neighbors,
M:	The neighborhood?
A:	Yeah, I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God,
M:	And that's why we're in the market for houses, huh?
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
M:	You should have bought it
A:	That's how bad it, I know.
M:	How bad is it?
A:	That's right. Uh-huh, yeah. I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really, really bad. I mean you,
M:	That is a real place.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes, but it's a lot of houses
A:	How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually, because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania
M:	Uh, what?
A:	That's not too bad. That's north.
M:	I'm in the middle of Pennsylvania.
A:	Are you going up toward, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M, Bradford, no that's too far north.
M:	It's a small town in central PA.
A:	So you're, you're not that far north then, okay.
M:	I live in Bradford.
A:	Well, you're really not too bad. Yeah.
M:	I'm not too good with names
A:	Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years, or that you've,
M:	Um, yes.
A:	Oh, then you have, yeah. Do you have a lot of land or,
M:	I have a house, so I can live in it.
A:	Oh, my, well, then.
M:	I don't think it's the same, I've been in it since I was six.
A:	There you go. Did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like you live in an isolated area or,
M:	I, uh, don't know.
A:	Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
M:	Upper Saint Clare
A:	and now it's it's a terrible connection.
M:	It's not a connection. It's a city
A:	Oh, well that's okay, um,
M:	I'm not from the area, I'm from Pittsburgh, I don't have a clue about the internet, but I'm not going to
A:	But, but, yeah, substantially, you know. Um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
M:	I know.And, we live in an old house.But, I'm in a house with a nice, clean, quiet place.
A:	How big is it? How many square feet do you have?
M:	I'm down, I've been looking for a place to live for a while now.
A:	Well how many rooms do you think, yeah?
M:	Uhh, no. I'm not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I guess you're right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We're all in a bath.
A:	A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too. That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
M:	I think we have one room, but that's all
A:	That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
M:	That is huge
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is a big problem.
A:	It's enough space for two people Yeah.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	I was joking.
A:	Yeah, right. That's okay. Well, we've got, um, this town house is pretty big. It's about eighteen hundred square feet. It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
M:	Well, they're not out on the street.
A:	um, it's really nice.
M:	Well, I don't know.
A:	Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	That's a great deal.
A:	Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know. Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
M:	Well, the owner is a lawyer.
A:	right, near Dayton, Ohio, and he said, you know, he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
M:	... where do you live?
A:	Right.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can't have your own land.
A:	That's kind of what, like his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia,
M:	He's a big guy, he's got a big gun, he can do whatever he wants.
A:	and it is too far south for me,
M:	Uhh, what about it?
A:	but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these. I mean, it's just beautiful. It's like a custom, you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins. You know, I mean, it's modern it's,
M:	LOLGlad.
A:	Right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country
M:	A lot of all of modern, all of course
A:	it's you know, um, but, uh, I don't, what else about housing except it's, uh, well, Pittsburgh's housing economy, I think it's holding it's own.
M:	It's, is, uh, is
A:	What part, what sections are they in? Yeah, that's nice.
M:	I think they're in the mountains, but I could be
A:	Great.
M:	... and?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Which one?
A:	Uh-huh. That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by that.
A:	and, um, it's, it's, you know, they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
M:	Uhh, I think you might have the wrong person here.
A:	Um, but it's a beautiful home and, I mean, my brother lives,
M:	Uuhhh, yes?
A:	is it called Baldwin or Bebble?
M:	It's, like, beautiful.
A:	I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um, it's real pretty up there. It's just,
M:	Oh, that's a pretty cool place.
A:	And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
M:	That's why they call it the North.
A:	It's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
M:	Wait, what?
A:	Oh, my goodness.
M:	This is how I felt when I was married to a guy from Texas.
A:	Uh-huh. That's what it is here, yeah, that's why we're at a point now we've, uh, we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in Yeah,
M:	...
A:	that's kind of like where we're,
M:	And we have to move out of
A:	so we're considering Pennsylvania, and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
M:	Where are we
A:	A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and, but I disagree with that, I.
M:	I do, I think it's weird how many people say they don't live in a place that matters.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, if you're a native American, you should probably be.
A:	I know, and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady, but it's still not going up.
M:	It's because of the economy, not the people.
A:	And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
M:	Uhhh, I, uh, I don't know.
A:	Oh, I'm sure, yeah, there, I mean, you can go down a street, and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
M:	I'm, it, I'm, you, that's, I,
A:	um, it's really, I mean, and, and it's hard to sell the properties. People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
M:	I, and, right.
A:	And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
M:	I'll, yuh, money
A:	I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
M:	The
A:	Yeah, I know, and that's, you know, like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
M:	It's like you can see the future.
A:	You know, it's across the way, and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
M:	Hey, you know, you can look at the other side of the wall, and it'll look right back at you
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
M:	It's still, it's not that bad
A:	Yeah but you have a rider.
M:	There's no such thing as a bad time for me.
A:	No, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
