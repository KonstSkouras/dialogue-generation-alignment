M:	I was in an airforce, it was, uh, forty...
A:	Andrews?
M:	We've got to go back to, uh, where we came from.
A:	Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
M:	I don't know...
A:	but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry.
M:	Ah, well I'm just a little bit jealous.
A:	Um, September really was, I'm not sure about October. I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer.
M:	I mean, September is a month in the summer.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, so you're just being weird then.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	June.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Oh, if you had it early.
M:	Well, uh, and.
A:	Yeah, I think we usually have a frost in October.
M:	Wait, when do we get the frost?
A:	Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting, and it has not today, but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day.
M:	It's been raining for like 3 days now.
A:	Flooding anywhere. I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, but, uh, no, I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
M:	Are you referring to the flooding in the area
A:	Yes.
M:	Yeah, please, yes, and.
A:	Yes, yeah, we had summer lasting long and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.
M:	but not
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's just, it's.
A:	I don't know. Yeah, our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now. I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
M:	it
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	yes, it's.
A:	Yeah, we, we did, for a time.
M:	Did you guys have any color in your leaves?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm pretty sure the only thing that's ever gone is the last time.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's a nice car you have there.
A:	Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
M:	Uhhh, I know.
A:	Um.
M:	Ooh. Um.
A:	Yeah, that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early. Is that right?
M:	It's only like, one of a few trees that it can tolerate.
A:	If it would came later it would be all right?
M:	It was an early spring freeze.
A:	Um.
M:	I'em
