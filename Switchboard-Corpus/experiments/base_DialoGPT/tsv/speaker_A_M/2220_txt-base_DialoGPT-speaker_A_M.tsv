M:	I'm pretty sure that's a joke.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you like jazz?
A:	But not all country. I don't like that, when they start,
M:	You like it.
A:	I don't know. I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.
M:	Why do you think it's a good idea?
A:	Yeah.
M:	You like some country?
A:	My truck is broken down.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah.
M:	No.They.are.the usual.
A:	There, there's a guy, have you ever heard of George Winston, he plays piano.
M:	I'm not sure if I'm being misunderstood or not.
A:	I think he's dead now, but he plays wonderfully.
M:	Not sure if you're joking, but I have a friend who plays piano.
A:	I like that.
M:	He is the best.
A:	Very badly. I've got a piano,
M:	Do you play any instruments?
A:	my mother got a piano and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, so we all had to take lessons, and I was the one that did the least poorly, so she gave it to me. And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. It is real relaxing.
M:	I like it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm just wondering.
A:	Oh, so do I.
M:	You
A:	Forgot about that.
M:	You're not missing much
A:	I said so do I, I forgot about jazz
M:	I don't know, but I think you have to do jazz.
A:	Yes, we've got about five of those. I love them.
M:	I think the majority of them are, and I like the song, but I don't know if that s a majority.
A:	Uh-huh. I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
M:	Yeah, I'm not sure what you mean.
A:	and I just, I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful.
M:	Oh, I just... I just love them.
A:	And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
M:	I think they're called'Bongos '.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Don't you hate it when your own child cries?
A:	I mean you can just sit, you know those little booklets that come along with it
M:	
A:	and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
M:	You
A:	My, my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.
M:	Oh... I guess that's a good idea
A:	Huh?
M:	Well, you have to be a fan of the band to buy the pieces
A:	I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, but he does.
M:	You don't know who he is?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Not to be that guy, but it's a song
A:	Were you in the band?
M:	I can identify with this one.
A:	So was I.
M:	I played drums for a band once.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you play classical flutes?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Yes, yes, I like, you like, I, you, like, yes.
A:	I like the Moody Blues. Did you like them?
M:	I liked it.
A:	So what type, Simply Red, I've never heard of that. Is it just instrumental?
M:	Nope.
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
M:	I.
A:	Yeah, where are you?
M:	Are you in this picture?
A:	Okay. So we're in Garland.
M:	I'm in the same area
A:	Yeah
M:	You know, I'll just walk over to the other side of the river.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I know. I'm in east Texas.
A:	Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
M:	Why are you talking about the internet?
A:	For colleges?
M:	I know, right?
A:	Well, they're not
M:	I'm from East Texas.
A:	They're not going to recruit me anymore, I'm through. No more for me.
M:	The east Texas school of engineering has a very large enrollment.
A:	What, what do you do?
M:	I do.
A:	Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
M:	I'll be going to a state school in the northeast, and that'll be the best part.
A:	That'd probably be pretty interesting. I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. They had summonsed eight hundred people, about four hundred showed up, and it was for a murder trial.
M:	lol
A:	This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.
M:	What?
A:	And they had us fill out a long questionnaire. We stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June.
M:	June
A:	And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed. Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	The, the investigator. Yeah, he, he got off right away.
M:	I
A:	And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
M:	He said he'd get it back.
A:	so I figure that that will make me biased and I won't be chosen.
M:	I'm not sure, I just know that I was told to say that I wouldn't have to say anything.
A:	Hopefully
M:	I'll do it.
A:	Yeah. No. *aa
M:	I mean, what would be the point of voting for you?
A:	I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
M:	
A:	You know. Uh-huh.
M:	I know.
A:	Yeah. But then when you're, when you're picked, see I was picked for another murder trial before
M:	I'm so sorry
A:	oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision.
M:	Well
