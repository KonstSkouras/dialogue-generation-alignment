A:	Is that a nice vacation spot?
M:	I've been to Detroit a few times.
A:	Right, okay.
M:	You were.
A:	Right. So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
M:	I was. I'm not really a tourist though.
A:	Ooh, that would be nice.
M:	No, not that. I don't think so.
A:	Did you scuba dive there?
M:	I live in Brazil, it's just a tourist place in the middle of nowhere.
A:	Ooh, that would be nice.
M:	They have some nice beaches, and a big aquarium.
A:	Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.
M:	Well, I'm from Australia. I'm not going to be able to go to any other countries, so I guess it would be fun.
A:	I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
M:	So... How's it going?
A:	So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long
M:	I can't
A:	Worked at a camp there, and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
M:	oh, like.
A:	Oh.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	That's nice. We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.
M:	I
A:	And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.
M:	You can't be serious.
A:	It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
M:	
A:	and we would have to, we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and, That's a good family place to go,
M:	Yeah, the, you, a to, the to, he's
A:	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.
M:	Well.
A:	It was like,
M:	that's a pretty cool family tree
A:	That's true.
M:	You can't really learn new skill when you are older, it's like you have to be really good at something.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Oh? What about it?
A:	Yeah.
M:	So you're not a bad person then.
A:	Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
M:	I don't know, maybe.
A:	And then I went to England a few years ago.
M:	... and then?
A:	I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.
M:	What was the school?
A:	And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
M:	Fun.
A:	It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,
M:	I
A:	and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
M:	I
A:	and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
M:	No
A:	You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,
M:	You
A:	I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
M:	Why not just go out to the park?
A:	And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting.
M:	Yeah. You do have to talk to other people to get the message across though.
A:	Yeah, I know,
M:	I've been going to see it for a while now. It's so awesome.
A:	I keep wanting to get up to, I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States. I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,
M:	That sounds really cool.
A:	Oh.
M:	I live in Canada
A:	Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.
M:	I'm from Canada, I know where it is.
A:	Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
M:	That's good.
A:	So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
M:	Oh,
A:	Yeah, we have. We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.
M:	That is a lot
A:	It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, and you slept on the train at night.
M:	You know,
A:	But there wasn't a, it was strange, it was kind of sad, there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.
M:	I was in the middle of the bus at the end of my shift, there was a problem with German
A:	So we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in and got seated, and then no one knew English in there, and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
M:	Is it just bad?
A:	But it was,
M:	That's what you're supposed to do with your first language, not your first meal.
A:	Oh, I had fondue. That was easy to say
M:	What was it?
A:	Tried to get fondue and white wine, and that was,
M:	I don't think you did
A:	we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly. There were some people at the next table who spoke English, so we elicited their aid for a while
M:	... how do you do this?
A:	and, they were very helpful
M:	And, we were very friendly
A:	so, It was, it was a pleasant time.
M:	I know it was
A:	I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
M:	i dont,
A:	Right. That's
M:	I know, right?
A:	That and sleeping late
M:	I'm a college student, so I have no money.
A:	I keep hoping for.
M:	This is the most important thing for me.
A:	Well it was nice talking with you.
M:	It was nice meeting you too
A:	And have a good afternoon.
M:	Good morning, sir.
A:	Okay.
M:	No, I'm sorry.
A:	Good-bye.
M:	I don't think so.
