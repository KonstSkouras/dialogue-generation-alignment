M:	I'm so glad you like it.
A:	Oh, but how wonderful. Are you close to getting it done?
M:	Oh I'm just kidding, I don't know if I've ever done it before.
A:	Oh.
M:	It's a real thing.
A:	Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
M:	Well, I am a female.
A:	Uh-huh, kind of your getaway place.
M:	Ahem... Richardson.
A:	Oh, how beautiful, and it's pretty flat there?
M:	Yes, but the climate is much better than it was before
A:	See, I've only been to Texas once. I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas, and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this
M:	You.
A:	and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful
M:	Well, uh, I've been to Austin twice, and...
A:	I liked the hills and the trees,
M:	Did you go to Austin?
A:	Oh, and you've always,  lived in Texas, have you?
M:	I'm not, I'm from Texas
A:	Uh-huh. Born and raised Texan, huh.
M:	Hey! You're not from Texas.
A:	Well, I had never been there, that's pretty neat. My sisters both seem to like it pretty well. My brother-in-law works for the University, um, in Dallas. He's admissions director. Uh. University of Texas in Dallas.
M:	It's actually pretty neat.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So I guess you're a Texan?
A:	Yeah, well that's, he's got a job there and this is his first year, so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
M:	Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm still a bit confused.
A:	But they seem to like it okay. I think they're too far away from me, but maybe some day they can get closer,
M:	They have a great office and a nice community.
A:	we'll see.
M:	I don't know, maybe they're in a bad mood
A:	Well, I'm mother of four, so basically I'm just, real busy with my kids right now in sports, and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight, and, I substitute at the schools part-time.
M:	I see. So you like playing with other people?
A:	Well, I am a travel agent at heart, and my hobby is just, I love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out more, uh, but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband, so I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school,
M:	lt
A:	so I've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting, and I'm enjoying it. I'm around my kids
M:	I'm so, you're, I'm you

M:	i wanna be in it.
A:	Oh, yeah, well we're, we are on the dry side of the mountains. Seattle is only about two and a half hours, so of course I'm a real Seahawks fan
M:	I'm not a Seahawks fan. I'm just a Seattle fan.
A:	and, um, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.
M:	You guys have a pretty good defense, I think we can get a TD.
A:	And, um, so, and we're on the colder side, they're on the rainy side, we're on the snowy side and, um, we, we ski. My, my children all ski
M:	They, uh, we ski.
