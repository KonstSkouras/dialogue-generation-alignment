M:	No, I'm not, you're not a real threat to me.
A:	Okay
M:	No, I'm not.
A:	Pardon me?
M:	He walks over to you
A:	Okay, well, there's, uh, it's kind of an interesting topic and one that I think is quite fascinating because, uh, couple of years ago, I guess, uh, not very, not very long ago, seemed like the whole world, not just the United States, but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in, uh, you know, a very comfortable position, so to say, even though the, the cold war was, was in full swing. You know, you had the, the Russians against the Americans, the Communists against the Free World, and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically, not only on the political front but also on the economic front, where, uh, couple of years ago we had, uh, America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned, and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period. We're also have a very humongous trade deficit, and, uh, and that's kind of frightening. Also, you know, a couple of years ago, ten, fifteen, ten, fifteen years ago, an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life, and thirty years ago, that was, that was basically it, whereas now we're expected to have a career change every, you know, every couple of years and possibly four to five career changes throughout our lifetime, and so I think, uh, you know, things, there's been an awful lot of social change lately, and and, uh.

M:	Oh, is that what you think?
A:	True, true.
M:	Heh, I see what you did there.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, do, do you think that's good or bad?
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not going to say.
A:	You think that's great.
M:	Oh. Well I don't have any good ideas.
A:	That's some, yeah, because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position, they, they're very comfortable, they lose the ability to learn, and they in a sense become unteachable. They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five, and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education, and, and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh. Right. I agree with that, I agree with that. But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn
M:	you, you
A:	learn how to adapt, learn how to grow in the, in their college or whatever education they might take. Well, that, that's good, that's good.
M:	
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	you.
A:	Yeah, I, I read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
