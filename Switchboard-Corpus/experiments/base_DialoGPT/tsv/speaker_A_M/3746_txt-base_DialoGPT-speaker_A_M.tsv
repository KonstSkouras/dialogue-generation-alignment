M:	Uhhh, I know, I'm just gonna go sit in my chair and wait for the next one.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, how close are we?
A:	Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?
M:	Uhhh... I'm in Dallas.
A:	Oh.
M:	Well, we play in the same course.
A:	I was going to say, that could be difficult
M:	I know that. I just wanted to say that I've played golf with him a few times.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh.uhh
A:	I think that might be true.
M:	It's because you don't have a cart.
A:	I don't like pulling a cart on Firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path.
M:	Oh I get it, you mean the cart in the golf course?
A:	That is the reason, I don't play over there.
M:	We don't have a single cart in our area
A:	I like the course, but I don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.
M:	Why? I'm a nice guy.
A:	And, I don't think a cart damages the turf.
M:	It's just a cart.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, we don't have any courses there
A:	Well, I guess I could use a card too. I live, uh, very near, uh, very close to the Firewheel Golf Course.
M:	I love.
A:	Yes, I live in northwest Garland. Right up there near the golf course.
M:	Are you in the area?
A:	Well, in the last two years, I have not played very much golf because I am involved in Boy Scouts.
M:	Uhm.
A:	So, I have, uh, I have, uh, I have children  Boy Scout age.
M:	I'm on the one
A:	I have two boys that are boy scout age, and, uh, so I am very active in Boy Scouts
M:	Well, I don't know.
A:	so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.
M:	How do you know?
A:	But I
M:	You can't say that.
A:	but my golf clubs will probably rust before I get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
M:	I'm sorry you have to play golf
A:	That's right. Lessons are expensive though.
M:	I can teach you how to do it.
A:	Well, they would probably never make it then because I don't think, uh, I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.
M:	But you can play golf in the woods
A:	Uh, as a course for P E you know so I could graduate.
M:	How would you know?
A:	But, uh, that is the only time I think I have ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual.
M:	Oh right, right.
A:	I took one lesson one other time. Besides that, uh, I just, uh, try to make the club hit the ball.
M:	Well, that's uh, a little much.
A:	I don't want to play strike out, you know.
M:	Well, that's how I've always been, and I'm just not a good hitter.
A:	But I have fun doing it, some, uh, you know, I have some good shots and some bad shots.
M:	I'm not even sure what to do.
A:	So you said you work, uh, in the gardens too. Do you have, uh, a special flowers?
M:	Oh, it's okay.
A:	My wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.
M:	sighs
A:	She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.
M:	I'm curious, what happened?
A:	And they have been, we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.
M:	I know they are blooming, but they are still growing.
A:	That is when she did, I think.
M:	Did she have the plants in?
A:	Uh-huh. Do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? Will they make it through the summer sun?
M:	
A:	Well.
M:	
A:	Well, that is good.
M:	Well, I got a few plants from my garden, so I can get them all over the place.
