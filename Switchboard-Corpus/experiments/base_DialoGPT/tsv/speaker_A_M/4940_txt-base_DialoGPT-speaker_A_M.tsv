M:	I'm from Texas.
A:	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's ...
M:	They're
A:	No, not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
M:	Are they in Texas?
A:	Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.
M:	Well, I'm in Dallas.
A:	Uh-huh  We're  packing and getting ready to go to .
M:	Oh, okay. I'm gonna go and do that then.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's alright.
A:	Yeah. Oh, okay.  Yeah, you do then.
M:	Oh, I'm not talking about the city of L A.
A:	Is it really?
M:	It's actually the worst, in the, world.
A:	I would not imagine that.
M:	A city that's been in the middle of a civil war?
A:	Huh.
M:	Smog is in LA.
A:	Huh.  You learn  something every day.
M:	TIL that there is a city in China called Beijing.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, I've seen that.
M:	Haha. You know, you know, better running cars.
A:	Huh.
M:	They use the corn to fuel the vehicles.
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	Uhh, I've heard of those.
A:	Huh. No
M:	He nods.
A:	Oh, yeah Yeah.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. I guess?
A:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	It's a lot easier to say the world is flat when you're not even half way there.
A:	Right.  Huh. And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right?
M:	Yeah, uhuh.
A:	Yeah. Huh.
M:	Yes, you can
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uh huh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh. I thought they were looking at a battery powered car.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhhh... what's that?
A:	Huh  That is good.
M:	That is the best thing about the car. When you're driving, you're always at a full stop.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I see.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Are you sure?
A:	Huh.
M:	Electric cars.
A:	Oh.
M:	Well, it's a little easier to find the car then it is to find a place.
A:	That would be nice. I think I saw that on T V one time. They, maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that.
M:	I don't think I've ever seen a car in a non black car.
A:	Huh.
M:	There are also solar powered vehicles.
A:	But what,  I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like
M:	I think they did.
A:	I don't know. Huh. * See note above
M:	A. Yes.
A:	Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too. .
M:	You know what? I'm going to... I'm
A:	Well, yeah.  Yeah.
M:	But... I
A:	Well, it doesn't make sense. Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
M:	I don't understand, why do they want to convert?
A:	Yeah.   Yeah.  Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
M:	I
A:	and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know. So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
M:	I'y
A:	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
M:	I'm still in L a lot
