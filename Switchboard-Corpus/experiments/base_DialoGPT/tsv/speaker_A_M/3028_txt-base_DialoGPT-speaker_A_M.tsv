M:	She was already there.
A:	So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
M:	She nods and walks away
A:	Not for the price?
M:	I think, uh, I'll try to get out of the house and spend some time with her.
A:	Okay.
M:	I do not eat at restaurants.
A:	Uh-huh. The Really? Okay.
M:	I don't think you can afford that
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh. Well... I guess you can't really argue that.
A:	My word, it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
M:	It's like a real life version of a movie.
A:	Oh.
M:	I was thinking more of the food.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You serious?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	He's pretty good.
A:	Okay.
M:	He's not wrong.
A:	Wow. And where was that at, near your,
M:	Yeah, it's the one with the beef and the
A:	Where, is it in Dallas?
M:	Oh. Um,
A:	Is it in the phone book?
M:	You know, you're not wrong.
A:	Do you know how to spell it?
M:	It's a reference to the book.
A:	Okay.
M:	Umm, I'm not really sure.
A:	Kalli , K A L L I? Okay.
M:	Yeah, I think you're right.
A:	Uh-huh, section, yes, uh-huh.
M:	How do you find it?
A:	What about fast foods? Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
M:	Well, that's, uh, not good.
A:	You do, like Arby's? See I don't like Arby's.
M:	We like Arbys.
A:	No, because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever. They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver and they, they form it, and they make it look like roast beef, and I said, no, thank you.
M:	What?
A:	Well, that's not what I heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
M:	?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What is this?
A:	Really?
M:	I've worked at Arby s for many years.
A:	Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
M:	Well, they are the only ones that aren't a big deal to me.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No.
A:	Okay.
M:	I'm not sure if I want to go.
A:	How about the health food, uh, restaurants? Well, like this one but it's probably not advertised as such, is it? Or,
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Uh-huh. Health food, uh, restaurants that,
M:	What kind of food do you think would be best?
A:	Well well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
M:	Like, like, name one.
A:	But they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. You know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them. Now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called Rodolfo's over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.
M:	...
A:	And they have very good food over there.
M:	You know.their.their.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. They do list, um, you know, list the fat,
M:	How does it, how?
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	But I'm going to the game!
A:	Well, it was pretty reasonable. I, it was around ten dollars for lunch. Okay, which is kind of high for lunch I guess.
M:	I don't think it was that much, it was probably like, 50 dollars.
A:	Yes.
M:	You were going to eat lunch?
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	Is that what I said?
A:	Yeah. Uh, but, um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, uh, um, men waiters.
M:	Yes.uh, um
A:	Well, if you're looking for a nice, Uh-huh. Well, I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. It's a special occasion, type thing.
M:	You.
A:	Yeah.
M:	No, and
A:	Uh-huh. And now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Because they're, Well, they have lunch specials that you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.
M:	Why do you hate the red lobster?
A:	Well, I had the, I had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent. It was a marinated, broiled chicken breast and it was
M:	I'm not,
A:	Oh, it was,
M:	I know, I was joking.
A:	Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north and that was a no no.
M:	No, it's a food.
A:	And I haven't gotten over that from the north.
M:	You're from the south.
A:	I know they say that, that is,
M:	The north is best
A:	but I'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
M:	That's a good thing, though.
A:	and so I kind of stay
M:	he's gonna go down
A:	Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. I mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
M:	Why? I love the lake.
A:	and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
M:	It's all about the fish.
A:	I, Well, yeah. So I am, and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
M:	I'm, well, I'm, I don't, stop eating
A:	So I mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
M:	We have to look to the future.
A:	So I'm, I, you know, I,
M:	Are you sure?
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Corrode. Huh.
M:	I'm so confused.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, uh, I don't want to, uh...
A:	Well, I'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
M:	Err, yes. I'd rather have the metal in the water, rather than a mess of rust.
A:	Oh, dear.
M:	They don't. They have a long life.
A:	Wow.
M:	It's a joke.
A:	Sure. Yeah.
M:	Well, this is old.
A:	That's right. Everything we eat. Everything, everything we eat should have a label on it
M:	And what if we eat it?
A:	Yeah.
M:	But we can't, right?
A:	Well, you know,
M:	I think I know.
A:	Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
