M:	.of?
A:	and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It,
M:	Um.
A:	And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
M:	But I like it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	...
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	How much of what?
A:	Yeah,  yeah, I think so too. But, you know, it's one of those things.
M:	hehehe, yeah, that's right
A:	Yeah.
M:	yeah, yeah,
A:	Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever.
M:	I say, to be
A:	Yeah.
M:	But... the company is still a part of the company.
A:	Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
M:	This
A:	Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can,  stay off of it.
M:	I see you're?
A:	Yeah.
M:	That's a.
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	I think so too, uh, I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, boy, they just really, you know let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently
M:	It
A:	but, uh, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably feel any differently,
M:	Ohhuh?
A:	and some, some of them did quit the company.
M:	Some of them are just going to be on the internet forever.
A:	True.
M:	I'm, it's.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	we.
A:	Yeah,  I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
M:	I would, but I'd have to be the one to ask you.
A:	don't tell me what to do, you know.
M:	Uh huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'd be willing to bet the majority of those guys are just as bad.
A:	Yeah. Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. But I think it's too minor and too, you know,
M:	
A:	in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street.
M:	You,.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You're
A:	Well, yes.
M:	not.
A:	That, yes. I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
M:	I would be a little, I could be, you
A:	you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
M:	That, and the whole,''
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know, that's why
A:	Right. No.
M:	i.think it can.it.show up and flag as positive
A:	I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,
M:	I think you mean the one I'm talking about
A:	and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.
M:	No. It's a pill.
A:	You know, that's, that's totally out.
M:	A lot of people are saying that, I think.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, there's
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't know, but, I think.
A:	Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
M:	Yeah, but, uh, there are certain things they could do without a doctor's prescription.
A:	enjoyed talking to you.
M:	I guess so.
A:	Good-bye.
M:	I am
