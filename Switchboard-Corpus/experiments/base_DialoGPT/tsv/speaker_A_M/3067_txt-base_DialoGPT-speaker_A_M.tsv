A:	All local. Were they like all in Dallas?
M:	They, uh, have a family
A:	Oh.
M:	No, no, no. This is the Mississippi.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	It was in the middle of the night
A:	Just from city to city then .
M:	That's where my family grew
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, uh, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, uh, uh.
A:	Do you go back?
M:	I've been to a few weddings, they were great.
A:	Is it choice or just business or,
M:	I've never gone back to the house, I've never been in a car, and I've been away from the house for years.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hahaha. You're so funny.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A:	Oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway. Would you not?
M:	No. I just wanted to go back.
A:	I mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,
M:	I meant that he had a family reunion, like, the last time we went to the cabin, right?
A:	Relatives, right.
M:	Friends, right.But, uh, we are, uh..

A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I don't know
A:	Right, right. Right.
M:	I'm glad you
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhuh
A:	Is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes , we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.
M:	It's just.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We douh
A:	Right, right.
M:	The, have you
A:	It really makes an effort on, to, do this anymore.
M:	We're going to do this.
A:	Right, right.
M:	It's not, it's just, it is.
A:	Right, right.
M:	It's just a good, fun,, game.
A:	Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.
M:	Yes, I do.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I don't
A:	Right.
M:	Hah, ah. I, ah, ah... I don't.
A:	Right, right.
M:	I mean, uh, I'm not really a big fan of them, but uh, yeah, yeah.
A:	Right. In my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City. They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the Texas, Oklahoma area.
M:	?
A:	And, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,
M:	sends
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order. And then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about this person. You have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
M:	then
A:	So, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.
M:	No.
A:	And that, that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, I think.
M:	You're, we've been, we.
A:	We tried to start that in my husband's family. His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and I said, well let's start this letter, and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. I sent it, on to the next one,
M:	I'm sorry
A:	and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in Scottsdale, Arizona, for that family.
M:	You can't
A:	We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left. And the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home, so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.
