M:	i
A:	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
M:	I,
A:	and each, uh, home does participate but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything. And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.
M:	It's a joke
A:	Yeah, that's good.
M:	You.
A:	Yeah, yeah. That's another thing.  You have to go to different places to do that.
M:	...
A:	Uh-huh. But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me.
M:	No,
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Hmmm.
A:	Yeah. That's good,  that's good.
M:	Oh, um, well I think it's a good idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well that's nice
A:	Huh.  No.
M:	it is.
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
M:	No, it's just a plastic recycler.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do they have different kinds?

M:	That.
A:	and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that
M:	Yeah, and...
A:	She lives in Garland and I'm not sure where, what she does. But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
M:	Uhh
A:	Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
M:	Oh, uh, I've got a paper bag.
A:	Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing. And she does make a lot of sense.
M:	You mean she's not?
A:	Just her whole house is like wow.
M:	She nods.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. That's weird.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But you have the choice of which one to pass it.
A:	Yeah. And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat. I sat and watched him. You know the Barney? You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney.
M:	No.Of course not.
A:	They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing and how children can, can do that and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on.
