M:	Wait, how did you get him to sign with the Giants?
A:	So, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
M:	He's not that young.
A:	Right now, both of us are students.
M:	What's your age?
A:	Uh, Uh, University of Southern Mississippi.
M:	What's your school?
A:	Uh, she's,
M:	No, she's not.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know?
A:	Uh, probably. Uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
M:	Well, uh, that's uh, uh... uh, well, uh uh, we'll see what happens.
A:	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
M:	I don't think you understand.
A:	It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
M:	... and a week?
A:	So depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. Right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. Uh, I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. You know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
M:	
A:	So for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
M:	Just...
A:	Uh-huh
M:	You, the...
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. Uh huh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You could have done the same.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, uh, you're a bunch of uh, uh...
A:	Yeah.
M:	Um, uh, they've been in the country.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, they're kinda...
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's cool.
A:	Uh, that makes a big difference.
M:	Oh, I don't know about that.
A:	Yes.
M:	You think it is good?
A:	Yeah.
M:	So... you think that's good?
A:	There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
M:	How do you know this?
A:	And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department
M:	I was the one who made the, uh, first mistake.
A:	uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	So,
M:	I'm not the only one who thinks this, uh, is it just me or is it
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know what you're talking about.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, cool.
A:	Yeah. Yeah,
M:	I'm sure it's just a matter of time
A:	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,  because if you over,
M:	Yeah. I think it's really 
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.
M:	i don't think it's a real life thing, but i
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	Yes. And it's amazing how much good things like, uh, Sesame Street will do.
M:	You.
