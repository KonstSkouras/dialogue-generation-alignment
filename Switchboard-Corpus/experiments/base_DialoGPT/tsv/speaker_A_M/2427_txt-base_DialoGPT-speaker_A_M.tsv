M:	I do it too, I've grown up around the area.
A:	I see.
M:	Because we have a little plot, and a lot of plots.
A:	Yeah, you do a lot more area than I do. I've, all the rest of my yard, backyard is, uh, you know, pool and decking it's all the dirt I have, left in my backyard
M:	That's a lot of dirt.
A:	Well, I I enjoy fiddling around. It's cheap entertainment.
M:	I don't think I've ever seen a good game of pool in my life.
A:	It is, uh-huh.
M:	I think I'm going to be out.
A:	That's right. Yeah.
M:	You know, it's kind of cool.
A:	I enjoy,  Excuse me, go ahead. Uh-huh.
M:	... but I'm not a girl
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Umm, um.
A:	That's right. That's right. Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Takes a lot of room.
M:	You know, I love, uh
A:	It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was.
M:	Does it
A:	They do. Well, it was very good it just takes up, you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area.
M:	What? No.
A:	It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic we just do, oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	My wife used to plant a few snow peas. I don't really care for snow peas. Well, she just plants a few for herself.
M:	I'm sorry
A:	Yeah.
M:	We do
A:	Did you really?
M:	I got a snow peas last night.
A:	Oh, I see.
M:	They arent. They are in the garden.
A:	Okay. We don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
M:	No, it's not.
A:	Probably so. Yeah, you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	That's the plan. I have a lot of practice
A:	I guess it, it, might would,
M:	But, uh, I don't, I'm a woman, so...
A:	yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Because of?
A:	Well it will make, it will make them taste better I'm sure.
M:	I, I don'know.
A:	Sure. You got to inspect it, yeah.
M:	That's the point of the place.But I don'think you'll be able to find it in time.
A:	Sure.
M:	Do you like it?
A:	Sure.
M:	I like swinging.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know what I mean.
A:	No.
M:	Do you?
A:	I, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,
M:	Not if you live in the home we have.
A:	and boy, it is really nice,
M:	The whole country is beautiful.
A:	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
M:	It's not a home we're living in, it's a home they're living at.
A:	That's right. That's right. It's really nice.
M:	Yes, and that's why it's called a'' road''.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's been a while.
A:	I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard. I, I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard,
M:	You have a nice yard.
A:	I just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done.
M:	Uuhhh, how come?
A:	I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, you know, until I retired
M:	How do you get a lawn?
A:	and now I, I've lost my excuse for that so I have to for the last couple of years I've done it myself.
M:	Uhm... no.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	How about an E?
A:	It is kind of expensive, it is.
M:	... I have no idea what that is.
A:	Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
M:	They're not expensive.
A:	That's right. If I have a problem discipline, you know, I think, now, boy, I really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	That's right.
M:	You'll get high if you do that, boy.
A:	That's right. I'm, I'm kind of bad about that.
M:	You're, you're, it's, it was, it is
A:	I enjoyed having a lawn service but now I have the time and I really can't, I really you know, don't,  want to spend the money for it.
M:	You have to do it yourself.
A:	Yeah. That's right. I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, you know,
M:	You know, I just have
A:	I can do it on most any day of the week.
M:	Why not on the weekend?
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	You can do that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you do it?
A:	Yeah.
M:	They are.
A:	That's coming up here pretty soon. Is it this weekend?
M:	they have an hour left.they are just gonna rollback a lot of the servers.
A:	It's pretty soon.
M:	When is the patch coming?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Wait... Is it the same as last year?
A:	I believe it is too.
M:	Wait, what?
A:	Well,
M:	I'm not sure.
A:	Uh, not a whole lot, uh. I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
M:	I know.
A:	I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then, again, I don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
M:	... what do you mean?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're... I'm not sure
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I've been using it for a year. I've been having issues with it
A:	Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
M:	You can't tell me what to do!
A:	Yeah.
M:	Uuhh, I'm not sure, I think it was broccoli.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	Yes, but I was not able to get out of the plant.
A:	Absolutely. They really go through it,
M:	He's still there.
A:	they really do. Yeah.
M:	They really do.
A:	You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
M:	Yeah, and they eat the tomatoes
A:	Boy, they'll strip,
M:	They'll strip you of your tomatoes, and then turn you into a tomato.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. Uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, they're a good company.
A:	I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before, I've got, my garden is shaped that I can, it's kind like this, uh, box shape, so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
M:	LOLPT : ummm
A:	and, you know, various other things, Raised it up.
M:	You know, I am so happy that you put this up.
A:	And I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have, oh, I'll have less of a bug problem at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
M:	good
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	So what you are saying is, you're gonna build a roof
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you think?
A:	Yeah, Right.
M:	You know, I think, that's how they do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I mean, I can't really help you with that, but I can help you.
A:	That's right, you, you have to work on. You, really do.
M:	I do, but not to my liking.
A:	That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden so I had, I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
M:	LOL, it's good
A:	No. I don't, I did it by hand,
M:	You know what i meant, I don '?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hmmm.hm.hm. How did you do it?
A:	It wasn't too much of a job,  really.
M:	Not that much, just a lot of work.
A:	Like I say it's just,
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It would be handy.
M:	Hahaha I can't do that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	That's just, like, your opinion, man.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, you can just see the picture of the tree...
A:	Yeah.
M:	He's the one that runs the dog park.
A:	It might be handy,
M:	I like the idea of it.
A:	They're pretty neat little, I've never seen one.
M:	I don't think you can use the gun with a gun in it.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh Right. Yeah. That would be neat, sure.
M:	Do you?
A:	We've had a garden, gosh, for years and years and years, of some size, you know,
M:	I have never heard of a garage.
A:	I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.

A:	Yes, I've for the first time we planted them this year.
M:	do you have any onions?
A:	Yeah. We tried to find them last year, we screwed around and waited too long and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
M:	I thought they were the best. I think we found them in the first year.
A:	But we've got some this year.
M:	The leaves are so green, they're just not ripe.
A:	Snow peas are up and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.

A:	they were. That's right.  We use a lot,  we sure do.
M:	I bet they're a lot.
A:	Yeah. One nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, you know, too many.
M:	i dont think you can, they arent really that good.

M:	We're gonna make a green bowl.
A:	and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
M:	I can't wait to see what we do with this
A:	They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.

A:	That will be neat, yeah. Absolutely, they're expensive.
M:	Uhm. I think you need to pickle your own.
A:	I don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. I really, don't know.
M:	So... what's the difference between them?
A:	That will be interesting.
