M:	You
A:	The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.
M:	I
A:	They pick up everything.
M:	Are they just like a group of people who work together?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	There are a lot of homeless people in Florida.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But I have the money to buy a new car...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	uhhhhhhh. Uhuh.
A:	Yeah
M:	I think they are.
A:	Uh-huh. I know it, I know it.
M:	It's all the students, the students...
A:	It piles up.
M:	How do they get to the other side?
A:	I just don't know.
M:	I don't have much to say about it.
A:	I just don't know and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff.
M:	Well, I am an engineer.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Parking is free on campus.
A:	I know it, I know it.
M:	This is an inconvenient fact
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	The ,
M:	You're, uh, good at it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What is this, a for sale?
A:	Well, I mean, it's real, you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.
M:	I know.
A:	And since we go there all the time, I mean
M:	Oh, I'm not that crazy.
A:	probably at all.
M:	What's the most common thing in the world?
A:	Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.
M:	Yeah, I know who you are.
A:	Hi.
M:	Hi Bill.
A:	I'm from Atlanta.
M:	You live in Atlanta?
A:	Neat.
M:	Yeah. I live in Atlanta.
A:	I just think that everybody ought to do it.
M:	How do you know?
A:	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Yeah.
M:	I know.
A:	Oh, yeah, they have, uh, uh, what I, what I used to, uh, now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
M:	You mean like, like, recycling?
A:	but, also most places, like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not but,
M:	Most places do.
A:	Yeah, and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in.
M:	I think of stuff you?
A:	Can bring them in.
M:	How can I get in?
A:	I know it, I know it.
M:	You know what?
A:	It really is a small,  hostile planet
M:	We are the universe, it is us.
A:	Did you know that, No, really not. Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
M:	That's not a very nice thing to say.
A:	Huh?
M:	And paper!
A:	Well, it is, it is, though.
M:	You don't seem very threatening.
A:	It is, because they,
M:	I think it's bad, because it's not even bad.
A:	Well, they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.
M:	The paper is chemically treated, so it can't break down.
A:	You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
M:	They have to leave it on the ground, so it will not decompose
A:	Yeah
M:	You mean, like, in a place where the ground is dirt?
A:	it will be whole. You'll be able to read  off of it.
M:	I can't read that.
A:	Yeah, um.
M:	That's the thing, I can't read the yellow legal pad.
A:	Well, white paper's bad too. They, they treat it, too.
M:	It's white paper.
A:	I'm sure that's fine.  I'm sure.  Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
M:	Aye
A:	Maybe.
M:	... are you sure?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you have a tablet?
A:	You think? I don't know, well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,
M:	You're not the only one.
A:	I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.
M:	It's the internet. Everyone has a laptop.
A:	We would no longer need paper at all.
M:	We use paper
A:	I would love that.
