M:	Well, that's what I'm saying.
A:	you know what I mean?
M:	I know, uh huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Right.
M:	right.
A:	That's it.
M:	There is no way that I could live with that.
A:	Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
M:	.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know, all these things. I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
M:	You can't, or we know,
A:	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
M:	I'm not.
A:	I, I think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	Well, the trial is a bit of a stretch.
A:	I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
M:	Well, I know what I'm doing with my life.
A:	I, I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
M:	I'm serious. I'm pretty sure that there are a lot more of those people in the legal system than you think.
A:	You know, if someone is
M:	I think he's a sociopath.
A:	Well.
M:	I know it. I'm a lawyer.
A:	Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly  but  you know, they get lesser sentences
M:	But, I don't know, that's the whole system.
A:	and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.
M:	That's what the
A:	But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
M:	Yeah, they know.
A:	you know what I'm saying? That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
M:	... because we're a state.
A:	And, uh I, I think they should.
M:	I think you should get rid of capital punishment.
A:	I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people and, uh, you know, all
M:	I think you misunderstand what I am saying.
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
M:	It's a quote from the movie'The Prestige '.
A:	Yeah.
M:	No, I'm, uh, I am.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Oh, really.
M:	No, he didn't. He was arrested.
A:	It, uh, Yeah.
M:	He got out?
A:	I know that, that  Uh-huh. And, I don't know. Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?
M:	It's u I Am The Law, I know.
A:	Oh, yeah. I, I, I don't agree with that at all.
M:	Yes.
A:	Imagine the guilt that person would have. I mean  burned out.
M:	You... I don t, I?
A:	There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
M:	I... I don't know.
A:	If you had to do something like that, day after day.
M:	I feel like that would be a good way to go.
A:	No. Not really.
M:	So what do you think is the ideal outcome?
A:	Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
M:	Yes, because the people who were arrested are guilty of murder.
A:	I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.
M:	How do you know that?
A:	In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
M:	I'm saying that there is a difference between being right and being right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm pretty sure you can.
A:	Yeah.
M:	That's what I said.I think that you can remove the judge.But can't you remove the defendant.And it's not like there's a jury.
A:	Well, I, I,
