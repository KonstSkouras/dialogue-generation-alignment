B:	Right
M:	You? Um, I'm not sure.
B:	Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
M:	Yeah, I'm not really sure. I don't really have any plans for the next year, so I'm kinda just gonna wait for the new year.
B:	Well, a little bit for the price,
M:	How about food?
B:	but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places I've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
M:	I like to eat at the most, and eat a lot of food.
B:	Really. Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
M:	I'm sure I can find some
B:	Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and I was like, I'm not eating in there Are you nuts? And, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	lol
B:	Yeah.
M:	I guess. You?
B:	I'm serious.
M:	You serious?
B:	Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to Atchafalaya.
M:	She nods.
B:	No, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right.
M:	Is that right?
B:	someone in the What's the name of that restaurant? in the background Where at? . someone in the background The Hari Krishna. in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's . Kalachandji's. It's all vegetarian, and it, it was just fabulous. I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
M:	
B:	Um, Kalachandji's. It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
M:	I'm aghas aghaf.
B:	Yes.
M:	So, you're
B:	Uh, I think so. It should be.
M:	You're the best.
B:	Uh, it starts with a K.
M:	Oh. That's right.
B:	So K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
M:	I can't tell if you're talking about me or the guy.
B:	That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
M:	Yeah, I have to go to a restaurant. I'm not sure where I can find it.
B:	But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
M:	You're the best.
B:	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
M:	You can't really get it if you have no fast food
B:	Oh, really? Why?
M:	You don't have to like it.
B:	Oh, no, no, no. Someone has been lying to you. What they use is roast beef.
M:	But why do they make meat
B:	That's what, Oh, my goodness.
M:	Roasted beef?
B:	I'm surprised. My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
M:	So, uh, what are you going to do when you're done?
B:	Yeah.
M:	He chuckles.
B:	Well, that's happened before.
M:	They have been known to steal your food.
B:	But we like good uh, we're, we like Mexican food.
M:	I like it, but I'm not sure why.
B:	And stuff like that. And so, um,
M:	Oh, uh, yeah.
B:	A health food?
M:	We like, eat, uh, food.
B:	Like, like, name one
M:	I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
B:	I'm not sure what you're talking about.
M:	Are you talking about the food or the food?
B:	Huh.
M:	They're called'rood
B:	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	No. Why is it?
B:	It would be good I think,
M:	I think they would be.
B:	uh, I don't know how expensive they are. It sounds like that it would probably,
M:	Hmm, I wonder if they're expensive.
B:	For one person?
M:	I don't think so, I got a deal
B:	Oh
M:	A lot of people have a small family.
B:	A bit
M:	How about you?
B:	Yeah, I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
M:	You could, uh, not be interested.
B:	Yeah. Maybe, maybe that. Yeah.
M:	I'll show them.
B:	Yeah.  I could see that, then maybe.
M:	Maybe, I could
B:	Yeah, I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
M:	You know, I think it's pretty cool.
B:	Yeah. Probably that's true. But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
M:	Well,
B:	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
M:	I know
B:	That's one of my husband's pet peeves. He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
M:	Fish and chips.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	No, they don't.
B:	Oh, catfish is wonderful.
M:	The north.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	They're all amazing.
B:	Really.
M:	really really
B:	Why?
M:	I'll be here.
B:	Oh. Huh.
M:	There's a lot of water in the ocean.
B:	That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it
M:	I have been told that I can eat it without a problem.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I like chicken.
B:	That's true.
M:	I don't know, I don't like being on the look out for people I'm worried about.
B:	Oh, on one hand I see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
M:	Yeah, that's why I'm confused.
B:	So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
M:	Well, it's not really a nuclear weapon, so there's that.
B:	And then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
M:	Uhhh, they
B:	Oh. And then they wouldn't think. They were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them.
M:	I think that's how they got the radiation.
B:	And this is before I was born.
M:	You were born in 1988.
B:	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
M:	Yes. We did.
B:	and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
M:	Oh, I know, I was just wondering.
B:	You can't get away from it so I think, To some point,
M:	But what's the label on the label?
B:	yeah,  you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, this is not in my control.
M:	Yeah, that's why I said it.
B:	So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.
M:	I don't think so.
