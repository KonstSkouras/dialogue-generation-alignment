B:	That's the only way I could really,
M:	That sounds funny.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know
B:	During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff
M:	What? How?
B:	and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
M:	And they have a giant pile of cans and stuff, and a lot of money.
B:	and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them.
M:	u dogetipbot 10 doge verify
B:	But, when, during the winter time I think they, they move south or something
M:	Oh, you mean that they'll be back when winter comes?
B:	so, I don't do that anymore. And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
M:	They come in the winter and leave them in the recycling bin.
B:	They just overflow.
M:	What are you talking about?
B:	So what's a guy to do?
M:	A man's gotta do what a man's got to do.
B:	I asked myself.
M:	Who are you?
B:	Really? Huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient.
M:	There are no parking lots in the city center, so parking for people who want to park is very limited.
B:	Inconvenient, even
M:	You could always just unload it and park it.
B:	But, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?
M:	It's not that complicated, just make a little button for the button and drag it up.
B:	Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.
M:	You know, you're right.
B:	If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there
M:	I'd throw it, but I don't think you can throw a.
B:	but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.
M:	Yeah, but you're not a guy
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'll be in my bunk
B:	But wait
M:	And I know the farmer who goes there.
B:	I've never seen you before Who are you?
M:	That's a weird way to spell me
B:	Yeah, my name's Bill. Well,
M:	I'm sure it was.
B:	Hi.
M:	I'm Bill.
B:	Me, too.
M:	Atlanta.Atlanta.A.Atlanta.
B:	Crazy. Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?
M:	I love the smell of old people in the morning.
B:	Do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
M:	It's a thing.
B:	Really?
M:	They can recycle, and you can get them back.
B:	What about like those grocery bags?
M:	Not really. I just use it as a temporary storage.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, you?
B:	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
M:	But, what about paper?
B:	uh.
M:	They do
B:	Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
M:	That's a good point. I wonder if they will be able to bring in the oil from Saudi Arabia?
B:	The hostile planet, I think, Julie.
M:	Where is it?
B:	The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
M:	He's not a big guy.
B:	Um. Paper just seems so innocuous.
M:	That's not how you spell'paper '.
B:	Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.
M:	Paper. I know.
B:	It comes from trees. How can it be bad?
M:	I'm not sure if this is bad or good.
B:	They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it.
M:	I don't think it's bad. It's a plant, so it's a tree.
B:	Yep. Oh
M:	You know what? I'll stop being a tool.
B:	Really?
M:	They do, but it takes a while.
B:	Huh.
M:	They are.
B:	I'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then.
M:	she smiles back I'll see you then
B:	I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on. I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.
M:	i'm gonna go with the green ones
B:	Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile.
M:	It's all good. I'm good.
B:	You think so?
M:	You can
B:	Tablets?
M:	What about a book?
B:	I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.
M:	We should probably abandon the idea of being a family.
B:	What do you think?
M:	I don't think you know
B:	Kind of radical, I know but,
M:	Well, I think everyone is in on the joke.
B:	That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.
M:	But then you have to have a watch that's on your wrist.
