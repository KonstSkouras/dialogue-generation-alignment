B:	Yes.
M:	Do you have cats?
B:	Oh okay, you get so attached to them.
M:	The youngest one is the oldest one.
B:	Oh.
M:	No.No.no.no
B:	Oh no.
M:	I think he just got in a car accident
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What?
B:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	Did you know that's a thing?
B:	Yes, I understand.
M:	That's what I meant.
B:	Oh no, I understand, we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours, we've had, you know, they've been ill, I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,
M:	I don't know, I've been sick and tired for a while.
B:	my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy. And then we had a baby and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.
M:	
B:	It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
M:	Where's the other?
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	Well they are the only two that have left
B:	Oh no.
M:	That's what you said.Heh.
B:	Yes, uh-huh, that's it
M:	Oh, uh, I don't remember that.
B:	Right, traumatized for life here.
M:	It's a reference to Lord of the Rings.
B:	Oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats.
M:	So... are they house cats?
B:	We started out with two, with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
M:	What did you do?
B:	Oh well he lived through it, oh, I couldn't believe it. We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
M:	That's a lot of money.
B:	The, the cat almost died, and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat, oh he loves life now.
M:	That's so sweet.
B:	And he's like oh, thank you so much.
M:	He looks so happy!
B:	I know, we wondered about that. But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.
M:	That cat was just too cute.
B:	Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
M:	Was he shot?
B:	Oh yes, absolutely nuts. But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and,
M:	...
B:	I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
M:	Jesus. How did that happen?
B:	But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.
M:	He's a good boy
B:	Oh yes. But, uh, we wouldn't we wouldn't have them, I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.
M:	Well I have two dogs and a cat.
B:	There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.
M:	But why?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I have to get rid of them.
B:	Yes.
M:	Are you telling me that a cat is not safe?
B:	Oh no.
M:	I have to be home in time.It's not like they are going to miss me.But I'm sure they will.
B:	Right and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.
M:	It's hard to say.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know what?
B:	Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night. We, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.
M:	What about the cat?
B:	And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, uh, brought him home,
M:	Uhhh, I think I'm in love now.
B:	and oh, my husband just died.
M:	Uhhhhh, my husband and I are doing a wedding in July!
B:	It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.
M:	He's a bit of a... cuddlebug.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.
M:	Did you just give me your own apartment?
B:	Oh uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, uh, uh...
B:	Right.
M:	I've been there.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	But he was on the other side of the country
B:	Oh.
M:	You know, that is true.
B:	Right, right.
M:	Yeah, he's dead.
B:	Oh no.
M:	He was a good boy.
B:	Yeah.
M:	He was weaning on my finger.
B:	Oh.
M:	I'm a cat lover.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, but he's a cat.
B:	Oh that's good. Oh we just, uh, just love them. They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's like oh, your claws need trimming.
M:	oh god
B:	Oh yes, yes.
M:	Yes, yes, yes
B:	Oh it just drives us nuts.
M:	The weird thing is, it doesn't look like anything to me.
B:	Um, yeah.
M:	You have to admit it, that is one of the most adorable things I've ever seen.
B:	They really are. The cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog.
M:	I'm pretty sure cats are the most independent of all dogs.
B:	And, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.
M:	I'm gonna go with dogs.
B:	Yes.
M:	Is it just me or do cats look like little puppies?
B:	Oh, we've got, well the two that were outside, they're like brothers, I mean I've never seen two cats so close.
M:	I'm not really sure what you're trying to say.
B:	And, uh, they, uh, will get to playing chase through the house,
M:	I think they are friends, but they're not friends.
B:	and it is hysterical, I mean and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. It's like this train.
M:	You can't just... you can't.
B:	I mean it sounds like a train. We have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house
M:	Oh yeah, it's a train of cat's.
B:	Oh no, they're just, they're, they're just, uh, they're wonderful, uh.
M:	My cat's cat is a cat.
B:	Uh, we have, uh, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix.
M:	Are they yours?
B:	And what do you have.
M:	I have.
B:	Oh.
M:	Awww. I have a lot of stuff I need to do.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	Do you know what I'm talking about?
B:	Nothing.
M:	I think it's Precious and Raoula.
B:	Not a thing, goodness gracious.
M:	I think it's a thing.
B:	We have, uh, uh, tortoise which is a black and, and orange.
M:	I've never heard of a black turtle.
B:	And she's so ugly.
M:	They're both ugly.
B:	Yes, uh-huh. I mean you can't help but love her. She's, she's the oldest one and, but, uh, very possessive.
M:	Are you sure?
B:	I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma.
M:	You can't deny her beauty
B:	And, uh, I mean, it comes bedtime and she's right there.
M:	Uhh, um, hi.
B:	Yeah, she's the oldest. And she, well in fact I got her when I moved out of the house also.
M:	She's still in her house?
B:	And so yeah, it's, uh, wouldn't have, I mean, oh, if something happens to her.
M:	I mean, it's only her and she isn't.
B:	It will be.
M:	You don't know?
B:	Oh, goodness. You get so attached to them.
M:	Awwww, she's so cute.
B:	My mother has dogs and I'm like, no.
M:	Do you have any dogs?
B:	This is nothing like cats.
M:	I like dogs.They are cute.They have a lot of personality.They don't have a place in the house.That is why they are dogs.
B:	Right, I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked.
M:	I love my cat, but if he were a dog I would be a cat.
B:	Oh that's one of the requirements I asked him. I said, now you do like cats, right. We don't
M:	He didn't know. He said he didn't like dogs.
B:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	Are you okay?
B:	Oh yeah, oh, the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying, are you getting rid of your cats, are you getting rid of your cats. You can't be pregnant and have cats. I'm like, uh, no, no, no.
M:	
B:	Right, the child will learn to like cats. and deal with them,
M:	', you.
B:	I'm sorry, we are not getting rid of the cats.
M:	They can be pretty annoying.
B:	The whole family was so disappointed
M:	I would have been disappointed if the cat was dead.
B:	Right.
M:	I was kidding
B:	Right, uh, but yes, we just, just love them to death.
M:	Oh yeah, I was just joking around.
B:	Well it was nice talking to you too, I enjoyed it.
M:	Goodbye.
B:	Bye, bye.
