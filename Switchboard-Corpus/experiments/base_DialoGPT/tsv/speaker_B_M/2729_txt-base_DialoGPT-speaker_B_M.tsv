M:	Uh, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	... I... I don't know what to say.
B:	Wow.
M:	My dog is so beautiful.
B:	That's great.
M:	Yes. Yes she does.
B:	Yeah, well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
M:	I know, right?
B:	Yeah, she just appeared.
M:	Wait, what?
B:	Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, but we've had her now for about three years,
M:	Wait, so, uh, she's a dog?
B:	and I just, you get so attached to them.
M:	They're so cute!
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He was a beautiful dog, man.
B:	Um. Wow.
M:	Uh. You should try to be more like him.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
B:	Oh no.
M:	Well, he was a man of many talents.
B:	Oh, gee.
M:	He was really a big guy
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That was the hardest part of that video for me.
B:	Oh, I bet.
M:	I think they were just feeling bad.
B:	Oh gosh.
M:	I was so close to feeling bad for them.
B:	Yeah, yeah. How long has it been since the first one?
M:	It's been forever.
B:	Uh, yeah,
M:	Uh, yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah. Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me. I mean I was just, you know,
M:	No, I'm pretty sure it's a shepard.
B:	I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore
M:	I can't even speak English right now.
B:	And then God gave me this dog, so
M:	This dog is the best dog ever.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, huuuuh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uhh,
B:	Okay, yeah. Well you just do,
M:	I don't wanna talk about it.
B:	you can't help it's like, it's like a kid.
M:	I think you're right.
B:	Yeah, well when, uh, my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.
M:	You're all wrong.
B:	The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
M:	You don't have a golden retriever?
B:	like who knows, you know.
M:	She's a golden retriever, not a pitbull.
B:	But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
M:	I don't know. I'm just a little confused by this whole thing.
B:	And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
M:	I don't know, but, you know, it's in the title.
B:	she doesn't have a brown nose, and her she's sort of unicolor, you know, eyes are the same color and everything,
M:	Oh. Oh. Oh...
B:	so. I named her Rosebud, and, uh, a friend of mine said, she, that she this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years
M:	Oh, well.
B:	Yeah, right.
M:	I mean, it's, no
B:	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
M:	I love the dog.
B:	You know, she loves everybody. And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
M:	I can't wait to see what she'll do to me.
B:	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
M:	I'm sure she'll be fine
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	...
B:	Getting in, yeah.
M:	i.way.way.
B:	Oh, no.
M:	But, uh, they're so fast.
B:	Really.
M:	No, he had trouble with the river.
B:	Did puppy go to?
M:	He jumped in, in the river.
B:	Oh, that's good, yeah.
M:	I had the dog in the pool.
B:	Ugh, ugh.
M:	I'm going to go with puppy.
B:	Yeah,
M:	I loved it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I love it.
B:	Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool,
M:	It was pretty cold when we rescued her, but she's just been a bit chilly lately.
B:	and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
M:	You know, I never really understood why she would do that. She just had a bit of a bad luck thing going on.
B:	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
M:	I'd like to think that she was just laying there waiting for the water to cool.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I.
B:	Yeah Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
M:	No, I'm sorry.
B:	Yeah, and she, oh baths. Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
M:	Yes, I'm sure it was.
B:	Have you seen, uh, CANINE. The movie, oh,
M:	It's like, we're not there to fight.
B:	you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German, it is so cute.
M:	I'm so sorry
B:	Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's the thing?
B:	Yeah, well that's how Cleo, you know, she'd lay on her step,
M:	Well, you can't, I'll, I'm.
B:	but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
M:	Yeah, she said it was a bad idea.
B:	Yeah, but you really need to see that movie. I, I we bought the movie and I I don't know how many times I've seen it.
M:	It's not really that hard to figure out. It's not like I'm just going to go and see it.
B:	And it came on T V the other night and I was watching it again, and my husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
M:	Haha, that's awesome.
B:	It is great.
M:	I've never seen it,
B:	Yeah.
M:	Wait. I mean... are you sure?
B:	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
M:	Yeah I don't know.
B:	Oh really.
M:	I'm a soldier and I have a job.
B:	Oh.
M:	Well you're a doctor
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... What?
B:	Oh, yeah, there's just,
M:	I like it, uh, there's also
B:	Right, that's it.
M:	I know what you're saying.
B:	Really, not critical at all.
M:	You're not really giving it much of a chance.
B:	Yeah, they're really wonderful.
M:	The only good thing about them is that they have the ability to be used in combat.
