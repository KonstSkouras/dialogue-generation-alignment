B:	It is. Have you been living there very long?
M:	That's, very, very true
B:	So you've been there longer. We built this one about, uh, it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
M:	I was in the room for six months
B:	and we subcontracted it out ourselves. We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
M:	So... we subbed on a lot of people who didn't even get a chance to make a decision.
B:	and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
M:	I'm sure they'll love it
B:	My husband got his big garage. He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
M:	How is it?
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and, so he has all the work space he needs.
M:	I have a new car. I don't have a car.
B:	He,
M:	Hey. I don't know who you are.
B:	It is, and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, uh, built
M:	Why? It's not like the car is the only thing that's not being built.
B:	and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
M:	Yeah, but the houses were large, so the car was the size of the garage.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And the garaged houses are big and full of cars
B:	So we put a three car garage in.
M:	It's in the garage.
B:	But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. All of it was taken up with just car space.
M:	I think they did have a garage.
B:	And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
M:	The garage is for work.
B:	Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
M:	You know
B:	Oh, I see.
M:	This is the game where you
B:	Uh-huh. Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
M:	He does not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're not a bad guy.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why, because you know, they have all of their stuff of their selves.
B:	Right.
M:	Uhh... why not?
B:	Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
M:	He sighs.
B:	And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. His parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
M:	... That's a good question.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
M:	We do.
B:	Right. Oh, I understand
M:	I'm just trying to make the house fit in.
B:	Well, we, That's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
M:	They're all gone
B:	Well, I I haven't reached that point yet. I've heard people say that. But, uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
M:	Heh, that's good.
B:	He's out of college and has a good job,
M:	Why do you have a middle son?
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
M:	He doesn't know he's not married yet.
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while, but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
M:	uhh, no.
B:	That's what she plans to do.
M:	So he can go to college.
B:	So, I hope so.
M:	You can have my daughter if you want.
B:	Oh, ho-ho.
M:	It's not a problem.
B:	A whole new world. Uh-huh.
M:	I am. I am.
B:	I can understand.
M:	The most interesting thing about me is that I have never been on acid.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, you've been there. I've been to the library.
B:	So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
M:	I'm gonna go with a yes.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Are you watching them?
B:	Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
M:	No, I haven't put it up yet. I am not sure if I have.
B:	Um, uh-huh
M:	
B:	Well, we have,
