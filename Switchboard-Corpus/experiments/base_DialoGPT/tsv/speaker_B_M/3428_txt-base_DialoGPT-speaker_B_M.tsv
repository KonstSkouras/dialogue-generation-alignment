B:	And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
M:	' the,
B:	Yeah, it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, and, uh.
