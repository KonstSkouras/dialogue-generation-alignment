B:	It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time. And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop
M:	I see.
B:	and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.
M:	So uh
B:	Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,
M:	Well,
B:	and we've had it for a while, but all of a sudden it just wasn't working, and it looks like there's a part missing from it. My husband opened it up and whatever, and of course we don't have the receipt any more, so we can't take it back
M:	...
B:	Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
M:	Uhhh, you're right.
B:	uh,
M:	uh, but they have a receipt
B:	Yeah.
M:	so, you're saying, you could have the entire thing done in 5 years?
B:	Well, that's true, and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,
M:	We are the best at something. We are the only ones who can afford to buy a new car, and we are the worst at it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They are the most expensive ones in the
B:	Well, yeah, I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,
M:	Why
B:	I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,
M:	There's no lemon in that.
B:	you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time, and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,
M:	You, uh, you're a genius.
B:	I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
M:	Ohh, I thought you were talking about the lemon.
B:	We never could get it declared a lemon, and the car would go and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
M:	You can't
B:	and I, there was just, you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything, and they got it finally semifixed, but it was such a hassle
M:	Oh, you, there were no
B:	yeah, yeah it, it really is, uh, but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.
M:	I am
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That.
B:	Well, I think that's true, and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.
M:	not. I, i, I, and.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You're welcome!
B:	I think technology is better, I'm, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
M:	You.
B:	I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,
M:	I
B:	I, I, everything is so automated, uh, and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,
M:	What is the point of this?
B:	and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.
M:	It was done in an art program.
B:	Well, yeah, that's that's true.
M:	You know, I'm pretty sure the amount of time that's going to be spent
B:	Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.
