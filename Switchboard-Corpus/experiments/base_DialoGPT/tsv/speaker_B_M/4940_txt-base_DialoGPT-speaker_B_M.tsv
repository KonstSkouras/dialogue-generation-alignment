B:	Surely.
M:	Not. Yet.
B:	You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
M:	I know. They should have been more concerned about the smogginess of the air in the area.
B:	Right. I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.

M:	You were born in California?
B:	Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.

M:	I've seen it too, it's a lot of things.
B:	You ever heard of that?
M:	Uhhhhh... no
B:	Yeah. Methanol?

B:	Yeah. Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
M:	I'm a bit of a corn guy.
B:	Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.
M:	I don't know. I've never seen a corn crop that big.
B:	And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
M:	I don't really, but, uh, I don't know what you're on about.
B:	It doesn't make sense. Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world  is corn.

B:	Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
M:	That's a gas powered car.
B:	Unlike a car where it's running.
