B:	Uh, usually either black or red.
M:	Uhhh, uh, what color?
B:	And electric windows, and power locks
M:	You can also get the rear brake removed.
B:	Now,
M:	And what?
B:	Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.
M:	I've had that happen.
B:	It is just a real pain, or, you know, if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.
M:	That's
B:	And, uh, so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, uh, just really help a lot
M:	Uu do it's just, do, do it
B:	What about you?
M:	Uhhhhh, uh
B:	Oh.
M:	You don't have to be. I don't like power locks.
B:	Sure.
M:	Do you?
B:	Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
M:	I don't, I just want an Airbag
B:	No.
M:	Have we ever had an airbag?
B:	Well, it, it sure seems to save lives and
M:	That's a good idea.
B:	uh, yeah. I, actually, I like the anti-lock brakes.
M:	I, actually, I like that.
B:	And I have never had a chance to, I have been in cars that have had them, but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, uh, you know, on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up.
M:	I have never, never, done that.
B:	But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or Japanese?
M:	Well, uh, uh
B:	What was that?
M:

M:	I think the question is, why?
B:	It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.
