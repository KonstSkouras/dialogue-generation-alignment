B:	Oh, yeah. Well, most of my camping, I haven't done much since I was a kid but, uh, we'd, basically, take the tent up in the Sierras and, uh, usually just camp near some stream  or some lake.
M:	...

M:	
B:	and, uh, we just thought it was absolute heaven.
M:	Uhh, yeah.
B:	Uh, there was certainly nothing like a, a bathroom, a shower or anything, near by It was dig your own hole and, uh  and I I'm not sure I'd do that  that anymore,
M:	Uhhhh, uh
