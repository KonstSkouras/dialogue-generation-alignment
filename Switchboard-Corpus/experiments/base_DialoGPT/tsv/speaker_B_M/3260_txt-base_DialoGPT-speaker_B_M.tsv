B:	Uh, well, uh, yeah. We 've spend a spend a did spend a lot of time, uh, it really helped when the, uh, older one was old enough to get his license and could, uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems.
M:	...
B:	But, uh, I, uh, yeah, for one thing. Uh, but yeah, we, uh, we do but our two had, had, uh, totally different interests of, but there was not much, uh, overlap as such. The, the older one is not, was not at all into, uh, sports for the most part. Uh, he participated band and, and, uh, scouts were his two big things.
M:	s.
B:	And, uh and the, yeah, younger one is, uh, uh, the sports one and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite
M:	It.

B:	But then, uh, we also didn't do , spend, uh, time with them trying to, trying to, uh, you know, just family time.
M:	Hehe's, uh, uh.
B:	Uh, we had a, at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth. And, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, I would have liked to. I would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some T V watching.
M:	So

B:	Yeah.
M:	That's neat.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yea.huh.
B:	Uh-huh.  Oh, well, good. Well, I, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, you know, obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up.
M:	What?
B:	I, I, I grew up on a farm, uh, in Iowa, and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. And then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me and I, I helped out with it. But, uh, although I have brought my boys into to see where I work, it's not that easy, and it's, it's certainly not at all common, and they, they just don't really have that same idea,
M:	...
B:	so they, uh, it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
M:	I
B:	Yeah.
M:	I have to.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
