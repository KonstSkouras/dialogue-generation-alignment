B:	So, I own a home in Pensacola, and, uh, let's see, we are to compare homes. Correct?
M:	Well, we are from the same state.
B:	Uh, my home is, well, is typical for the area. I live in a development, uh, it's a relatively, I would say, well, God, it sounds like, sounds like I'm bragging
M:	Okay. So you're not, huh?
B:	But it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.
M:	It's a place.
B:	It's a two story colonial, which my wife and I designed.
M:	Is that an old model?
B:	Uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. Uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,
M:	... What's that?
B:	and it is, I would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. It might be, I would say it's probably midsized for the area. There are some smaller, and there are, you know, several larger.
M:	Is it large?
B:	And, uh, but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in, in Pensacola, in that area of Florida it, uh, it's what now, it is, uh, probably ten years old.
M:	That's, uh, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don
B:	And so it's, in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, uh, the you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know, let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
M:	Nope, no
B:	but,
M:	The house is in Baltimore.
B:	I really haven't, I really haven't, uh, when we built it ten years ago, it was, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
M:	I
B:	So, I, I would have really, I haven't really priced, you know, in the market, so I,
M:	What do you mean, I have, I, I've been to, you know, the moon.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	How much money?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... so what's the deal?
B:	I thought that was on the upswing again now.
M:	Yeah, it's not a huge deal.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But they are a part of the economy...
B:	Yes.
M:	You mean, like, in Dallas?
B:	Uh-huh
M:	Uh, I think the economy is good, so I'm not sure what's going on.
B:	Well, Pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now
M:	I'd say the Pensaclippers are the most expensive team in the state.
B:	And it isn't because of the, well, there has been a lot of speculative building. Uh, I don't know, perhaps not in Dallas,
M:	I don't think it is. It's a fact.
B:	but, uh, I'm sure people in, uh, you know, in, uh, Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it, uh, Pensacola is a Navy town.
M:	I've never been to Galvesto, I'm just not sure if I would ever be in a Navy ship.
B:	And home porting was a possibility a few years ago.
M:	Well, I'm in Galvesto.
B:	They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy,
M:	... I don't get it.
B:	a new carrier was coming in and, uh, the, uh, attendant, uh, support vessels. Well, that's no longer, the case.
M:	... what was the plan?
B:	Oh, it's, it is. I mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.
M:	You do realize that's not what they mean, right?
B:	And so overbuilding is, has been a real problem there.
M:	Yeah, the number is a bit high.
B:	So you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price. And I mean good, I would, let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. And probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.
M:	500
B:	What about your home?
M:	Well, that's
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's the rent like?
B:	Nor do we, but,
M:	Uhh, I don t know,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm pretty sure the house was made in the 70's.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hehuh.
B:	Right.
M:	Er uh
B:	Well, the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious. And in, in the entire D C area. I'm, I'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of Washington D C, and Montgomery County, Maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to,
M:	?
B:	No, we are west.
M:	You know?
B:	Sevren is east, near the eastern shore,
M:	I don't get it.
B:	if I had,
M:	I, wouldn't,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Sev ren?
B:	Oh, that's not unusual, yeah.
M:	It's like a million dollars or something.
B:	Well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in the, the immediate, you know, Washington area.
M:	The, then.
B:	And so, we, uh, I was just looking, for example there is a, uh, condominium complex next to the apartment complex where I live, and I was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. And ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom, which is essentially a two bedroom apartment.
M:	I'mverysmart
B:	Now, it was very nicely done.
M:	That was quite nice of you.
B:	I would have thought ,
M:	That was the plan, yes.
B:	Yes. I, I can't, I can't envision spending that much money, and on, on something along those lines.
M:	Did you not watch the video?
B:	So, you know, it's, I guess you pay the piper but, Plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally, high.
M:	No, I don't.
B:	Uh, for the, and so, you, on that it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house say, for example, in Pensacola, Florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,
M:	I
B:	but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.
M:	You, probably.
B:	So, it's, uh, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, but the taxes would be, you know, perhaps, maybe one-third uh, of,
M:	to, that's, a house
B:	Oh, absolutely. Yeah,
M:	Oh, I see. So, if you don't mind me asking, what
B:	so, it's, it's really sad
M:	Well, I'm not even a guy, and I've been told it's a joke.
B:	This is one, this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.
M:	I'm in the UK. I'm not a citizen.
B:	Well, they it, the, their, they do have an extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example. It has one of the best school systems in the country.
M:	Why do you think they have so many problems?
B:	Uh, and because the cost of living around here is so high,
M:	Why is that?
B:	public employees make great salaries around here
M:	But I'm from the UK.
B:	I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the, Montgomery County Public Schools makes, and I'm not, this is, uh, the figure, he makes eighty thousand dollars a year.
M:	You don't know what a Public employee is?
B:	That's,
M:	I'm not, I'm a private school teacher.
B:	and I, by administrator I, I think I mean, I, they didn't, they did not define it, but for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
