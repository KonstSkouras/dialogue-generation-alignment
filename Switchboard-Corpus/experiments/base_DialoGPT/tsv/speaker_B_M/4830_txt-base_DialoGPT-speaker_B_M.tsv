B:	Right.
M:	I know that the jury decides.
B:	Right. There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh
M:	What do you mean?
B:	there, there's no way. We, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
M:	They are.
B:	Uh, every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. Uh.
M:	We don't.
B:	Right.
M:	
B:	Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal.
M:	I'm a'there's.
B:	Yep.
M:	Can't be legal.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	What is?
B:	Oh, that's right. I work for a law firm
M:	I was at the school.
B:	Right.
M:	The lawyers have been involved in a lot.
B:	Well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
M:	Because it's the only option available to them.
B:	Plea bargaining is something completely different. That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up.
M:	If they get a plea bargain then they can be charged with assault.
B:	Right.
M:	I mean, the whole system is broken. That's why they're doing it.
B:	Right.
M:	It's a law
B:	Huh.
M:	They don't.
B:	Right.
M:	... but we do have capital penalty.
B:	We do
M:	Why don't we have capital punishments?
B:	Right.
M:	I think they're both guilty
B:	Right. When you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned.
M:	It's not that they're not guilty. It's that they aren't guilty.
B:	We just have the case, I'm, I'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry.
M:	I'm not sure, I've never heard of the appeal.
B:	Uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up
M:	Uh, what?
B:	So, I mean, his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail For cocaine possession.
M:	No, he's a minor.
B:	But, uh, that was absurd  There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
M:	He was on probation.
B:	Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd.  There's no way that could work.
M:	The appeal
B:	Uh, but,
M:	It's
B:	Oh, exactly.
M:	I, I don t know.
B:	Exactly.  Right.
M:	It's not about feeling good. It's about feeling happy.
B:	No one would want the job
M:	What if I told you, I would want to do this for a living.
B:	Uh, and, you know, like I said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
M:	I know.The majority do
B:	Oh yeah. I, I feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury.  That, that, that right
M:	I am, uhh, I'm not.
B:	Well, I mean, were there witnesses?
M:	I don't think so.
B:	Right.  Right.  That you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
M:	I know, I'm saying that you can
B:	I mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
M:	I was thinking of a different scenario.
B:	and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances
M:	There's only so many people you can watch in jury duty.
