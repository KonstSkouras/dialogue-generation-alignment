B:	Yes.
M:	Wait, so you think that's a real thing?
B:	Yes, it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.
M:	No, that's the same thing.
B:	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
M:	I think that is the point of the experiment.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes.
M:	Hehehehe.
B:	That happens on occasion, it sure does, maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
M:	It, it's, i know, you, you are, you.
B:	You know, I don't know, or a person personally.
M:	What's a coincidence?
B:	I think I would be, you know, I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty, I don't know that it's a big deterrent really. I don't know that it is. I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
M:	not.
B:	Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah, it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
M:	You're you are still not sure of appeals?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I hope you're kidding.
B:	Yes.
M:	Do you know?
B:	Yes it is. It's a tough, tough question. It really is. I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that. Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
M:	that.
B:	Oh, absolutely. that's right.
M:	i am i think you have to.
B:	Not with me personally. It is with a lot of other people.
M:	Is there a religious or a religious, religion.
B:	It's not, not to me personally, no.
M:	Is it, not to you personally?
B:	No.
M:	I am so sorry.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.
M:	Yeah, but if you don't feel it, you don't know how to feel.
B:	Yes, I think most states do have capital punishment. Yes. But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.
M:	You don't think most States have capital
B:	Yes, they're only, I was reading something about it the other day, I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.
M:	Isn't there a death penalty in the US?
B:	A lot of them had to have elected not to do so. Now I don't know, what they do in place of it. You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something, I I don't know how they handle it I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
M:	Ohhapparently.
B:	Oh, yes. Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
M:	That
B:	Yes.
M:	How do,
B:	Uh-huh. Yes.
M:	Well, I don't think they do.
B:	Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
M:	The appeal is that it takes a year or so to get to the next appeal.
B:	There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.
M:	I'm sorry. I don't get it.
B:	Yes, uh-huh. That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas. Before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.
M:	
B:	Yes, it certainly does.
M:	It's,
B:	Yes, it would almost have to be, I suppose. If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
M:	Does it have to go to trial?
B:	Yes, absolutely.
M:	Is this one of the better ones?
B:	It's a, it's a tough question. It really is. I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes. I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
M:	Is it?
B:	No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	Do you think we should have a prison system?
B:	I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
M:	How do you know?
B:	Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless. This may seem to be the best way out. I don't know.
M:	Yeah. It's a crime, but it's not a crime in the sense that it's illegal.
B:	Easiest way out maybe. No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	The worst thing is that it's not a legal thing.
B:	Yes, especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy. Yes.
M:	So what's the deal with Dallas?
B:	Absolutely. Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does.
M:	Do you know what the number of murders per capita in Texas is?
B:	Yes, it's nothing to be proud of, certainly not.
M:	Yes, you are.
B:	Yes. Yes, so have we been very, very fortunate.
M:	So have we
B:	That's right. Absolutely.
M:	Well, we are a very small country.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So what are you trying to say?
B:	Absolutely.
M:	Well, they do it all the time.
B:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, maybe.
B:	So would I, I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance, I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.
M:	If you were in the jury, I'm sure you would be able to tell the judge what the judge said.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Heh, uh. I think I know you, I'm uhhh... I think you're a guy, huh?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uh, yes
B:	Right.
M:	It's not a problem.it's a problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I'm not a lawyer but I can tell you this.
B:	Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is.
M:	I mean, you can't be the judge of the jury.
B:	Yes. So would I.
M:	I would.
B:	Yes. Absolutely.
M:	Would you be okay with this?
B:	It is, it's a tough subject, it really is.
M:	I think it's the most important question I have.
B:	Right. That's right.
M:	What about it?
B:	Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.
M:	Nods and smiles. Well, I hope you have fun.
B:	Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
