B:	Oh, you like the rain, do you?
M:	I'm going to try and enjoy the weather for a while.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It was nice to be home again.
B:	Oh, are you? I don't care for that as much.
M:	The weather is just too hot.
B:	No.
M:	I do.
B:	I'm a summer person
M:	Why do you have a summer job?
B:	I like the heat.
M:	I don't like the humidity
B:	Yeah, and I'm from Utah, so, I, I like, the four seasons
M:	It's winter, not summer.
B:	I just don't like the cold.
M:	You're welcome.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's cold.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I like it.
B:	The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Well, we have several children that are in sports, and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.
M:	You don
B:	I like it better, I think.
M:	This.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	We are.
B:	The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity, that part I don't care about.
M:	Well, it's not like you have to sweat to be hot.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	
B:	Oh, is that right?
M:	Oddo.
B:	Well another reason, well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. We have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,
M:	I do. It's not that bad.
B:	and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain, or, it seems they thrive when it rains, they just, really,
M:	You know, I've seen the light.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I guess.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I guess you could say it's raining
B:	Well,
M:	I'm ready for the cold and rainy rain and the rain.
B:	Well I like seventies I like seventies okay.
M:	I can't tell what you like.
B:	Oh, I don't like nineties.
M:	The Nineties.
B:	You can give me seventies
M:	I'm not a guy.
B:	and you can give me eighties
M:	No, you can't.
B:	and I'm okay. But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that
M:	Well you can keep it
B:	I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
M:	Why are you in the kitchen?
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	What's wrong with being a fan of the school?
B:	That's okay Um, I've, I've thought about that, too, and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here
M:	Why are you gone
B:	It just really gets way, when it gets way too hot
M:	I'm sorry, but it's so nice to be warm.
B:	and we've been here for several years, and we've been here years when it's been hundreds and,
M:	You've been to many places, and you've been there
B:	Years, uh-huh.
M:	I'm a guy. I'm not a guy
B:	Yeah, yeah. He, he always did such a good job, I thought.
M:	?
B:	A good weather man,
M:	
B:	Yeah. Anyway, um, I guess it's,
M:	No, he's just a good man.
B:	That's okay, they say when you're done you're done,
M:	That was the worst weather I've ever seen.
B:	you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.
M:	I know.
B:	You just say, Have a good day or whatever.
M:	Yeah, I'm sorry.
B:	You too.
M:	Good morning
B:	You too.
