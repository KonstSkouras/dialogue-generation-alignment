B:	Uh-huh.
M:	i,
B:	Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched.
M:	U
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, talk to me, you know.
B:	Well, it's very true, now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth.
M:	I
B:	Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh, I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere,  one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi.
M:	you have.
B:	But I lived in in Florida for ten years and I kind of like it down there, but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.
M:	I'm a Floridian and I think Florida is a beautiful state.
B:	I think uh, well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal.
M:	It's okay.
B:	I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
M:	Ah, I see. They didn't allow guns back then.
B:	But they uh quickly did away with it.
M:	They were also not allowed to carry concealed weapons.
B:	I think in the next session they they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida.
M:	Yeah I heard they changed it to a felony.
B:	The the one week uh seven day the delay
M:	It's been a week
B:	Uh huh.
M:	Yea but the 7 day wait
B:	Well I don't mind that too much
M:	Oh I get it.
B:	I'm I'm with the N R A myself.
M:	That's a weird way to spell
B:	And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
M:	We don't have any objections.
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's true.That's what I meant.
B:	Well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal?
M:	I'm not.
B:	Well let me ask you this then.
M:	I am not.
B:	How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
M:	I'm not
B:	Huh.
M:	You know what? I'm not sure.
B:	Well now wait a minute there
M:	I would never burn the American
B:	you just said it. It's their right by freedom of speech? What does speech have to do with burning a flag?
M:	I said it's their'right '.
B:	Now uh Well I I still go back to ...
M:	
B:	Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
M:	
B:	Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.
M:	Uuh, I don't.
B:	Uh yeah
M:	Uhhh, you know the flag isnt the
B:	but here again I go back to the second amendment You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.
M:	I don't think it's a good argument.
B:	Now I am I am adamantly against that.
M:	It is the right to peacefully assemble
B:	Uh-huh.

B:	No.
M:	You can't have a flag and a freedom.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh... I I I don't know...
B:	Well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
M:	I would never, uhhh.
B:	Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
M:	No, it's not.
B:	Uh, um so long as it's their possession. Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,
M:	Heh, sure, you can have your flag.
B:	and I used to know as a Boy Scout but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.
M:	Uhm, you're not the only one.
B:	And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.
M:	I think that's just an old man saying that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes. I agree.
B:	It's It's very easy to do.
M:	What's the deal with the'uh '?
B:	Uh Uh-huh.
