B:	you want to buy American.
M:	I want to know what's the best place to buy it
B:	Um.
M:	What?
B:	It terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
M:	What about the speed of the car?
B:	What about Mustang G T
M:	...
B:	Those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
M:	I can't, and, and you., and.
B:	Right. Well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.
M:	I'd rather wait and see what they do
B:	Right, would you use that for city driving and racing?
M:	I'm off
B:	Autocrossing is, what kind of track is that?
M:	It is that, it.
B:	Okay. And you put up, set up the track, pylons. Okay.
M:	It's a racing track.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah, I would guess so.
M:	I don't know. I think I'm the only one that thinks they are the best.
B:	Uh, I think I'd like to get, uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, I mean, a, a Acura Legend. Uh
M:	I'll buy it.
B:	a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order.
M:	A Honda, uh, Mercedes?
B:	You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think.
M:	Yeah, uh, I think you've got it.
B:	Yes.
M:	I was the one who bought the car.
B:	The, Yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
M:	It's, of,
B:	I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
M:	Well I was the one who told them I was
B:	Oh, really?
M:	We were
B:	Um.
M:	That's not.
B:	Yeah that's,
M:	It's the same as the B amp W, right?
B:	No, it's not realistic.
M:	So is it realistic to have Porsche Porsche racing on a racing simulator?
B:	Yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, uh
M:	It's a car, not a car.
B:	Yeah, just work, short trips. No no heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
M:	Do you think it's worth it?
B:	So it's pretty minimal.
M:	Well, I'm not a car guy, but I'm willing to take a small loan.
B:	Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for.
M:	What do you want?
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	It's the same as the Mercedes.
B:	But, But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
M:	But I have a Mercedes.
B:	Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
M:	You, it's not like the factory is expensive.
B:	So I'm kind, yeah, I'm not sure if I really want,
