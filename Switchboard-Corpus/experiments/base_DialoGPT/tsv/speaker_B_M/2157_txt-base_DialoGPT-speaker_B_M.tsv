B:	Well, they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
M:	I'm not even sure who the Cowboys are anymore.
B:	At least they're coming around.
M:	The Cowboys are gonna win the Super Bowl this year.
B:	Well I mean, you know, I think, uh, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, uh, they'll do all right.
M:	They're just playing the game.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And the Bears.
B:	I'm a Viking fan.
M:	Why do you hate the Packers?
B:	And they haven't been doing too hot, so.
M:	They're playing the Patriots, not the Jets.
B:	No, in fact, in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal.
M:	He was the best player on the Cowboys for a long time.
B:	I've never been over impressed with him.
M:	The Cowboys have been over hyped for a long time.
B:	Well, who's the running, is it Sammy Smith, or is it, Emmett Smith.
M:	That
B:	Emmett Smith.
M:	I'm still, he was a bit of course.
B:	Yeah.
M:	He's not that good
B:	I'm not sure.
M:	Is he?
B:	Who else is, uh, oh there's, you know, Mike , Minnesota Vikings, used to be the general manager starting the World Football League.
M:	What??!?! I'm sorry.
B:	So, and and he was trying to keep, uh, uh, I can't even think of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings.
M:	What?
B:	Jerry Burns.
M:	I can't think of a more iconic name than Jerry.
B:	he was going to keep him as the coach somehow, but, uh, I don't know, I'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow.
M:	That's a good idea.
B:	Well, they started out really bad, they went like one and six, and then they won five or six in a row.
M:	They're not that bad.
B:	So they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
M:	They won the Super Bowl and went 6 6.
B:	Yeah, I guess you can,
M:	You can't, you can't win a Super Bowl in a season.
B:	Yeah.
M:	The Vikings are going to the playoffs.
B:	And the Cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys, and the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season, and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys, so.
M:	You mean the NFC South.
B:	Oh, don't made any excuses for him
M:	no
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	I don't know  Yeah I think it was .
M:	We
B:	But, uh, well I got my thirty day notice yesterday.
M:	He's, what?
B:	Um, I'm done, where I work.
M:	You're done?
B:	So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that, but I just thought I'd throw that in there
M:	He's a little high.
B:	Oh, I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this.
M:	I guess you can't.
B:	They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.
M:	I think we should talk more about the past.
B:	Make sure we get our cash flow.
M:	I'm gonna go and get some food and drink.
B:	Um, actually, when I was younger, I was a Cardinal fan, too.
M:	I've been a Vikings fan since the Vikings were founded, I'm a Packers fan, and I'm not even a Vikings fans.
B:	Remember Jim Hart? Jim Hart was playing. Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals. This was a long time ago.
M:	I remember when I liked Jim Hart.
B:	Um, I don't know who else I've ever. That's about it, I was always a Viking fan. I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit and,
M:	Well, the only other person I know that's a Cardinals fan is my dad.
B:	Yes, oh, of course.
M:	Is that a thing?
B:	Yeah, well, the Cowboys were America's football team,
M:	
B:	there's no question about that, so.
M:	I think you mean the Cowboys.
B:	Again.
M:	
B:	What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?
M:	
B:	So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.
M:	
B:	That's interesting, I almost lost our electricity here .
M:
