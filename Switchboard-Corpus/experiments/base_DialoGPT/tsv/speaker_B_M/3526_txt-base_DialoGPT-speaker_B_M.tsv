B:	And boy that thing screams now.
M:	Yeah, but that's a four eighty six for six Hundred.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
M:	I think I heard it was three dollars and they just wanted to get it for free.
B:	Yeah, it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
