A:	but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Um,
A:	Uh, we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, uh, from that descendants.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's that's no problem here. Yeah, we really liked it up there but then
B:	If it's a company, you know that they're insured. Unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages,
A:	Well, most families, most families are young and both people are working.
B:	We've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	That's interesting, I almost lost our electricity here .
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?
A:	Uh-huh. Okay
B:	and, you know. Uh, and the reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, Well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight Nineteen. And I don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's, uh, Flight Nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two. Right after World War Two, and they were, they were lost and, uh,
A:	We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes. They just don't have them and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear,
B:	I have one and I can not remember the name of it, uh, it is supposed to be a mystery.
A:	Oh, yeah, he did, he did. It was it was really a shame.
B:	You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, from what I've heard,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have a recipe if you want
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You have to. Because   there's always more things to do.
B:	And as, as time grew, I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's, it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and I do not think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame
A:	Right. That will,
B:	Well, um, I'm research stuff here now so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um, and they pay for you know, pay for the classes.
A:	More taxes you pay.
B:	Well, she does not have it, but, she is like, on the verge of it or, something.
A:	and I was, I was there this, uh, summer and, uh, I was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for B M W.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	Sure.
B:	Where are you? See, Well, we've got a lot too. I'm in Texas.
A:	So. She was falling down and hemorrhaging and, you know, all kinds of physical problems, so it just became too much for me to handle, even though I would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore.
B:	I know, and I think, I think that's ridiculous.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They really do. I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more.
A:	Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north and that was a no no.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
B:	So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,
A:	and I think, um, in fact, if I had to do it all again I, you know, after that, you know, you never think of it because, I guess because I paid for all of my college education myself, I never thought about doing that because I had all these college loans I'd started paying back.
B:	let them, do it.
A:	Right, exactly. I was a, I was a Boy Scout. As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do, you know, projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project.
B:	I mean, I, I personally think life imprisonment, I don't think much of of life imprisonment. First of all, it's never, turns out to be life, but second, you know, why should we, the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. Well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again, well then, why bother. Just execute them, because that's, that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
B:	and then he gets up for this one trial, and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
