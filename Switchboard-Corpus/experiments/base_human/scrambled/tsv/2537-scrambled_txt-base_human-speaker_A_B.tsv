A:	Not as independence.
B:	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
A:	Yes, well, I've found out, too, that, uh, you know, a couple years ago, we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years, and at one time we could get a pretty good return, uh, with the Boy Scouts. We could take and collect the newspaper,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, that's good. I, I'm, you know, unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't, they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection
B:	And sometimes I, I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something,  like that.  Plant one of those
A:	Yeah
B:	then they put them back in jail, and they get out, and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
A:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	I was a social worker at the time, and found it,
A:	Oh. Now does, does the school in, in your, in your city, does it, does it offer, like band, or some of the instruments?
B:	"We did it that year, and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there. We sent invitations. We said, ""Please let us know if you're coming."" It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,"
A:	Wow.
B:	What does that mean, accidental tomatoes?
A:	Well, it's been nice talking to you again.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, I, you know, I keep telling them it's the same mentality you know, and something's wrong, and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night, because we're not home
B:	Yeah, I think it was November and I don't do anything to mine, water them or anything And they just, they do really good and I even had, uh, I guess it was last year or the year before, I had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible, but they came back later. I didn't do anything to them so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time. They last for a long time then. So, if you start putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too, but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.
A:	Both. If we're not doing sports we go somewhere.
B:	But, yeah, not my a lot, *sp? by and then somebody else lost, maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees,
A:	I don't know,
B:	and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right
A:	we got lucky. We had no damage to our house or anything so, The rest will just have to come with time.
B:	Oh.
A:	We do the same thing. It's, I just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet.
B:	Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.
A:	just like constantly, it seemed like,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well I,  uh, uh, I know it.
B:	Right.
A:	But I know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year. We got free tickets because someone at our church, one of the deacons at church, um, parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the, uh, the places and stuff.
B:	Okay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. How big a lot do you got it on?
A:	Of course.
B:	Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.
A:	Okay.
B:	Oh, oh, excuse me?
A:	Yeah, and that would be pushing it. So, I mean this is definitely a college town. Uh, we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh,
B:	Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.
A:	Were you in the band?
B:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	Well, they might tell you it's random.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
A:	Yes.
B:	Yeah. One year they were, they were just everywhere.
A:	That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden so I had, I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, I don't know, I think the, I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
A:	do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work?
B:	Did you sue him under the civil system?
A:	Huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	And, um, I know I was reading in the paper I believe yesterday that, um, they're talking, or maybe it was on the
A:	You do, like Arby's? See I don't like Arby's.
B:	and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue, and, uh, oh, that was great.
A:	But, uh, it's a problem, and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,
B:	Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That is the reason, I don't play over there.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	There, there's a guy, have you ever heard of George Winston, he plays piano.
B:	Yearly fee, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
A:	Yeah. And I'll do this, uh, sometimes I'll put my after I pour that into my, back into my saucepan. I'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg. So,
B:	And if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.
