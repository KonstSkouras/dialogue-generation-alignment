A:	And they,  would be deprived of their mother.
B:	Um, she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care. Uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory so they  were almost, you know, to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.
A:	Uh-huh. That will be neat, yeah.
B:	Uh, um so long as it's their possession. Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,
