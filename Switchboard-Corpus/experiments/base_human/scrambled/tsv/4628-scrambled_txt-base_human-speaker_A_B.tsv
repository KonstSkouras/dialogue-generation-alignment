A:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	These are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. You know, these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war. And, uh, they have, you know. So I, I, I do have a lot of sympathy for them, and I feel that America could try a little bit harder to, to help people adjusting to the American way. Because if they don't, you're just going to produce, you know, you're going to produce an underclass, you know. You're going to get a situation that I think a lot like what happened to the blacks, being sort of led out of slavery and then, then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then. And there was no,  real up, upward movement.
B:	I'll let you lead out.
A:	Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do
B:	and that may impact it as well.
A:	But, if there are some people who don't agree uh, then there must be, it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people.
B:	Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
A:	yeah, it's great, it's great, and what else do I do, I do lots of cross stitching when I have time
B:	and I find that I can often, you know, often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work
A:	Huh.
B:	Oh, that sounds good.
A:	everybody seems to be, you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting, and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold, and they'll say, well those are the ones that like the cold weather.
B:	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff but, but I think they're really neat and, you know, I think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
A:	Yeah.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
A:	Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything, we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday, it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog. It was like, oh, that could be it.
B:	And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.
A:	China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge. But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,
B:	I know, he's not a handy, right?
A:	How would,  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,  and things that would,
B:	Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah.
A:	but I, someone, I don't know, it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
B:	It starts with an E.
A:	That, that must be a fairly recent release.
B:	Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
A:	Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. There's, there's no easy solution for that.
B:	Nissan.
A:	I got a friend who goes there, by the way I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, that's right, that's right.
B:	Okay, nice speaking to you.
A:	See them. Yeah. Yeah. It really is. Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
A:	What, what do you think? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars, and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.
A:	Uh, when we were in Australia, uh, sad little things. Uh, I felt sorry for them. Because their society isn't there anymore, and their belief system and all their structured of theirs, all the structures of their society are gone, essentially.
B:	Uh-huh. No. Really?
A:	So I'm, I, you know, I,
B:	And, uh, I had sandy loam hauled in. I had a dump truck come and dump it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish. And he's going through the, I don't know, the Jewish League or something. And helping a family that's come over from Russia.
A:	Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, and I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, and I at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
B:	Uh-huh, I know a lot of
A:	I'm not sure what but,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um I would say I'm probably liberal yeah
