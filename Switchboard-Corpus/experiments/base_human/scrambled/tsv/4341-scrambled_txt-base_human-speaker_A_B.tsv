B:	Yeah. Sounds like you have a real good garden.
A:	and that we weren't normally very interested in them, and they have, in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know, that they have corruption, and, and they don't have, uh, I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.
B:	Oh. Yes. Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I love classical music, and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the, all the characteristics of the instruments.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah but, you know, we do everything together.
B:	Copper is kind of my favorite up there. Breckenridge and Keystone.
A:	and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.
B:	You're in New York?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Huh.
A:	Um.
B:	Right.
A:	Right, right. Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.
B:	Yeah, yeah, I, I use that for for rice and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	Well, we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict but, budget but, uh, the about and to our, when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just, you know, dirt poor. Then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. So, we virtually did that for about two years,  which worked real well, and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved,  and moved to Texas, bought a house immediately, you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,
A:	you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.

There's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play but that was, I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right. And you know, if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Wow.
A:	In fact, I am at work right now. Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela. Uh, I think what is really important, uh, of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job. And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits. Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	There you go I don't know that's a different subject,  altogether
B:	He's got on I B M.
A:	Oh my.
B:	But,
A:	so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around, I like them.
B:	Right.
A:	But I, you know, we have been really fortunate our family, hasn't had any crime.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
B:	I really believe that.
