A:	Oh.
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Oh, really.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Hopefully
B:	Right. I, I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.
A:	And, so we don't, it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.
B:	Some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent Son of Sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
A:	Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats.
B:	But wait
A:	Well, it's not too new.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers. We have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.
B:	Do you?
A:	Sure.
B:	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
A:	Yeah. And that does make a a person want to stay
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
A:	It is kind of expensive, it is.
B:	Oh yes, absolutely nuts. But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and,
A:	Um.
B:	It's eighty eighty-eight?
A:	Oh. Oh, okay, so,
B:	No.
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
B:	And I, so I mean, how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, I, I believe in the death penalty, I really do.
A:	So that was really fun.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I have one brother, so.
A:	I see
B:	Exactly,
A:	Uh, I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the, the border.
B:	Are you doing it yourself?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	Very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah, it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party.
B:	I think so. Yeah, seven twenty-five.
A:	Yeah, so I just wondered, you know, if the whole area was like that or,
B:	Right.
A:	Oh.
B:	Right, I, I usually see her a, couple times a year so that's no, no big thing. But, uh, I, uh, I do, I do enjoy the reunions. The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	They're all out on their own now.
A:	Well, I, uh, couple of them, I, at the moment, use an A S T two eighty-six and I got a leading edge and I got a American one and had a I B M one, but
B:	Uh, those,
A:	Same idea
B:	And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
A:	Products. Yes.
B:	and it's like, you know, um, they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago.
A:	That will be interesting.
B:	Uh-huh, completely. I mean, any kind of meat or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
A:	It goes from hot, and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer, and then it's cold
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, gosh.
B:	I'm a Viking fan.
A:	Yeah, the times are different, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, the green onions are coming along.
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
A:	oh, yeah, we they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
B:	Oh, don't made any excuses for him
A:	Uh-huh. Well, we're,  Who, who
B:	you're not kidding. Do you ever watch AMERICAN GLADIATORS?
A:	and, uh, I've seen, uh, a lot of people get convicted, sentenced, and then just nothing happens,  just endless, endless, endless appeals.
B:	It's a two story colonial, which my wife and I designed.
A:	Huh. Right.
B:	So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it. Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
A:	Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time, and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible. But now they have like this, you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
B:	Uh, what about you?
A:	Well, uh, the police force, for one, I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use. Uh, it's, oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
B:	And, uh, I read it and really liked it and then about, that is when it really got big. And, uh, so I,
A:	Oh, how beautiful, and it's pretty flat there?
B:	Oh, yeah that's about the same kind of thing.
A:	Uh-huh. Huh.
B:	No, it is not. It's lopsided, very much so.
A:	Uh-huh, kind of your getaway place.
B:	Exactly.
A:	Yeah, and that's lots of fun.
B:	and I've been drug tested three times and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus. So see I, for some reason, I've come up three times. That's pretty high statistics.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Ooh.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, it's terrible. I,
A:	That's right. I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.
B:	Yeah.
