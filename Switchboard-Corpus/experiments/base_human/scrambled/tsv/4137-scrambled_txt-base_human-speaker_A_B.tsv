A:	that are sometimes so dumb
B:	Always, yes ma'am.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Right.
A:	It's an eighty-nine and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight so, yeah.
B:	I like mysteries.
A:	They're pretty neat little, I've never seen one.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing
A:	And myself, I guess.
B:	An experiment.
A:	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. See there,
A:	Uh-huh. Really, oh, that would be,
B:	Right. My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I've always had this, one of the reasons I like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective.
A:	Um, you know, he would come home and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to you know, after he had to go,
B:	And even, um, uh, police corps which started, you know, finding other breeds to use because this thing, this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible. So about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this. So they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be. Which is a very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian,
A:	I mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
B:	But,
A:	or So what do you think? Should they, uh, should young Americans be forced to do a year of service?
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	All right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yes.
A:	Hi Ed.
B:	It's a, it's a tough question. It really is. I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes. I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
A:	And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list, but it's not off the list.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	Yeah.
B:	and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.
A:	what sort of company do you work for? Do you work for a big or a little place?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	She was she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty, so, it can be done.
B:	Well, I was from Illinois originally, and I grew up a Bear fan. And, uh, then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Just from city to city then .
B:	Or they on their within the own uh society, it can vary.
A:	Yeah, okay, I just thought they had some,
B:	But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time,
A:	Um, we've been real happy with it.
B:	Um.
A:	And now I'm a college educated builder There's still no work, you know.
B:	Oh, do you? So you live in Garland then.
A:	Wow.
B:	Well, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions. I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska, and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms, and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else, but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay. You're going to Commerce?
A:	And, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury,  a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,
B:	Oh, that's great, uh-huh.
A:	Yes. I know, I know. The insurance.
B:	But, um,
A:	Yeah, uh-huh.
B:	Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
B:	Oh, that's wonderful. Okay.
A:	Yeah, yeah, well neither can I, so, I, I, I, I, I, I, did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout, but never  never for a year again.
B:	Well, I I'm a physician. Uh  and, as is my husband.
A:	I guess it, it, might would,
B:	Uh-huh.
