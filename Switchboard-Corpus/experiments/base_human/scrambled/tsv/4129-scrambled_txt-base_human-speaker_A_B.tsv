A:	You said you have four cats?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, and, and it's, I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh, but for the,
B:	Well I work for an insurance company so I see a lot of, uh, verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. Um, by juries particularly, and I know in England the judges set all of the awards. You know juries will decide the guilt or innocence, but then they leave the awards up to more learned people. And I think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous, you know, like millions and millions of dollars
A:	And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
B:	Oh how,
A:	Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah. Well,
A:	it's a rotation.
B:	I see.
A:	Yeah, yeah. But, it's still good. It's still, uh, uh, you know, you don't really miss anything.
B:	Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,
A:	Uh, I Yeah, I and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable. Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. Yeah Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right
B:	Well, but it, then they can have them play against each other.
A:	I suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, I guess.
B:	Oh, oh, you are?
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that, and that's, that's pretty good quality time, with them,
B:	That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
A:	Oh, yeah. I, I, I don't agree with that at all.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	Well, he's from here.
B:	Well, I tell you, you know the, the German shepherd is the classic case of what I'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena.
A:	We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.
B:	You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know. I don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.
A:	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's ...
B:	But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas
A:	We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
B:	Are you? Where are a student?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
A:	Yeah.
B:	If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
A:	It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
B:	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
A:	and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
B:	Oh, that sounds nice. I like bluegrass, too.
A:	But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling.
B:	Yes.
A:	Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today?
B:	I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, I never really thought of it that way.
A:	But they have, I read somewhere, and I'm, I'm out on a limb here, some type of college, uh, volunteer work for teachers, that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the, uh, lower income brackets of the United States. Have you ever heard about that one?
B:	And so, Based on that, who do you think you're talking to, you're talking to an employer.
A:	Was it a boy or a girl?
B:	and but,
A:	And, uh, so when I met my husband, he was watching football and I figured out that I couldn't see him all weekend. I couldn't see him until like Tuesday because MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, if I didn't, like football. So,
B:	yeah, that's really lovely. I would love to have different fruit trees. It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches. They're just delicious. And, we, we we have, still have to spray some, but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good, because I just, I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.
A:	I don't think so.
B:	I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, and it just continues to get worse.
A:	But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. I don't, a lot of that's that recyclable steel and I don't know anybody that takes that.
B:	Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, so he could buy us material things.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Why?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
A:	that's the problem I have with it, in Texas they think it's and all and be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. We did that too,
B:	But, uh, well I got my thirty day notice yesterday.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
A:	Well, thank you, you have a good day.
B:	It's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
A:	There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
A:	No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Is it choice or just business or,
B:	Do you?
A:	Oh, gee.
B:	Well that sounds kind of dumb.
