A|And, uh I, I think they should.
B|God. That's pretty good.
A|Yeah. Um,
B|It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit, and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. Of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.
A|Yeah. I have a, I had a friend in college from Strasbourg,
B|Yeah, this thing that you thought you got on sale, by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time, you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing.

A|BON yeah.
B|Uh, yeah, uh, our, the my mother's side of the family is quite large, or well, was quite large at one time, and, uh, they, uh, for as long as I can remember, have had, uh, a yearly reunion, um, back, uh, early on they used to, to rotate them from from to, to different people's houses, in the family.
A|Uh, and how, how do you feel about, uh, let's see, eye care?
B|Uh-huh.

B|I think I would be, you know, I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty, I don't know that it's a big deterrent really. I don't know that it is. I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
A|but, but we love her anyway. She's just a lot of company to us. We didn't, we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer, but up until then, she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun.
B|Bye.

A|Yeah.
B|Are, are you, do you play the piano, is, or you just like it?
A|That's the last thing you want, to do.
