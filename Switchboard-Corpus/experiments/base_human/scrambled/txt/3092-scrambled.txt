A|Oh.
B|But why? Why is it happening?
A|Yeah
B|I think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, I mean, I think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
A|All that stuff that's bad for you.
B|and, and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
A|I, Well, yeah. So I am, and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
B|Oh, boy, that's frustrating.
A|That's great.
B|Yeah. Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care, it's not because the punishment, but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
A|What, what do you do?
B|Yeah, I, I know of some people who did, uh, it was, it was indirectly related, you know, they could always come up with other reasons but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude, because it's really, uh, it's just really, it, it seems so T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have, um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot.
A|You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
B|Uh-huh.
A|And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
B|And so it's almost impossible to, it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,
A|What about fast foods? Do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
B|No, they don't.
A|Yeah, did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
B|Because, uh, you know, that all depends, too, on where you are at. That's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. Because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, I mean less,
A|I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
B|Did you kill the deer?
A|It was like,
B|Yeah. Yeah.
A|But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really, I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.
B|Uh, yes. I, I try to grow, uh, uh, a vegetable garden and,
A|about, uh, like you say, using them, our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|So, five bedrooms and two living, two family
A|And, it makes, it makes it nice. It makes, you know, you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have  something else.
B|so we use that one.
A|Right, in that particular instance, uh, but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a and all and be all,
B|So what, you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?
A|Yes, I know, the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent and, they want, I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
B|They were just covered with them,
A|Oh.
B|Learned about their basketball team
A|And, uh, what we did was just, uh, decide how we had been spending our money before,
B|Yeah, we, we have, that is, uh, as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section, we, and we pay it sort of glancing nod. We, uh, have a very good friend who is, uh, tapped into the city planning structure. Uh, our developer architect friend and,
A|Huh.
B|Oh, yeah.
A|but you're right, it is temporary. Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
B|And we choose to bring congealed salad. You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,  as opposed to potato salad.
A|Oh.
B|And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
A|But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.
B|uh-huh, a lot of women do. Um, I've just never really, you know, maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow, but, um, my husband takes it on, and I'll help rake up the grass, and, um, sometimes I'll help him edge, um, because, we don't have that much property, but we're on a corner lot, so there's a lot of edging to do
A|Yeah.
B|Do your own thing. Yeah.
A|Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years, or that you've,
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, well that's interesting.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Good point. We've got enough without without a passport there's plenty.
B|Yeah, that's, you know, just minor. Just minor little ball here or there, you know.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right.
A|Right.
B|Yeah, we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,
A|Yeah. I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|But I do, I do think that, uh, I mean, public education in general I think can work. And I think it's a good thing.
B|and they liked that. And then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an F A, F A A, Future F A, Future Farmers of America, F F A going on there,
A|You can walk a dog and that's okay for weekend but cats are good all the time.
B|Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated, and it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases I think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person.
A|Oh, so he,
B|Oh, that's pretty good.
A|I mean, I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place. They said, the, apparently the crime, is, just, uh,
B|Uh-huh.
A|So, you know, it's just,
B|I mean you have to set an example. You have to start somewhere.
A|Exactly. I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too, and, and that's good too.
B|Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.
A|I'm sure it is, yeah.
B|No, I haven't, I know that, uh, my sister, I have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.
A|Oh, oh.
B|And my in-laws also have one, and they're almost as close.
A|They, they, just started trying to get them, something together like, like that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice storm uh, very, very recently.
B|Uh-huh.
A|What part, what sections are they in? Yeah, that's nice.
B|so they, uh, it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
A|The Texas Rangers, they, they lost, I think.
B|Uh-huh
A|Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
B|Yeah, except for time in service.
A|No, they're just mutts,
B|Um.
A|Look professional
B|Um,
A|Uh, she enjoys mowing. I can't believe it.
B|So you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.
A|So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas.
B|Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
A|Uh-huh.
B|yeah, that's important I would say.
A|Neat.
B|They just overflow.
A|It's still in existence.
B|Yeah. Actually, I'm a California born person.
A|Right, yeah.
B|Well, Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.
A|Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a, let down.
B|and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. It's, it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally
A|Well, no, and it's, it's just not, um, it's not as stable for the kids,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, I just found out that my car like an old was thirty months old, and it doesn't seem like it's that old.
B|Well, actually, you know, that's the breed standard for females. What you,
A|but we talked,  a lot about the, the rituals,
B|Uh, copperheads mostly,
A|Really, that's great. Well, my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death.
B|Oh, okay.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh, I think that's about where it is.
B|But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated.
A|Uh-huh. I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
B|Uh, she works at home some, though.
