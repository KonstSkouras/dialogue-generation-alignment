A|and, uh, now tonight I just finished up with that A WOMAN CALLED JACKIE, did you watch did you watch it?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue, and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which, you know, when you have fish au gratin, I was going to make some, uh, like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue. I don't know if it will come out.
B|And I pay a lot of property taxes.
A|but,
B|How long do you have to bake it?
A|I think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or, or a regular beater but, um,
B|Those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
A|Oh, okay.
B|Uh-huh.
A|So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when, but, I don't know, if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
B|and, and it was a real positive thing, but on the other hand you don't want to, you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road, you know,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, we actually planned for about one year.
B|Sometimes when you lose someone that you really love, you do some crazy things I don't know,
A|and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
B|see I tape MURDER SHE WROTE.
A|and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
B|Yeah.
A|Right.
B|But my youngest son is a skier.
A|It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that isn't how it was in Africa.
B|More luxury. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A|Right.
B|And then God gave me this dog, so
A|Exactly, although so much per month anyway.
B|Yes, we're not too long distance today.
A|Oh, that's, my husband's into, uh, computers.
B|Yeah, Lyndon LaRouche, that's it.
A|Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.
B|Yeah. I have a lot of, uh, uh, computer books that I am, I do computer work and so I have a lot of those. So, I spend a lot of time looking through those, not necessarily reading them but, looking through them.
A|Well, you know,
B|but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places I've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
A|So you do that and, right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
B|Oh, yeah. You bet you. You bet you. You know how they came up with the retriever, don't you, the Golden?
A|It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was.
B|Uh-huh. Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
A|The, the worst place was in Marrakech
B|Uh, she goes to a home. This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives.
A|Saint Claude is that sound familiar?
B|Absolutely.
A|But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
B|Oh, uh-huh.
A|I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um, it's real pretty up there. It's just,
B|Is that right?
A|Well,
B|See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
A|Right, that's a good idea.
B|Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment.
