A|and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, was realistic.
B|they always do.
A|Yeah, people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh. And then they wouldn't think. They were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them.
A|Uh-huh.
B|And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes. We had a great big fish fry, and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.
A|Uh-huh. That's right.
B|You know, they, they charge you, you know, it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.
A|Oh yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|or, you know semi .
B|Well,
A|Yeah.
B|Plea bargaining is something completely different. That, that actually prevents trials. Or at least speeds them up.
A|That's, that's the part that,
B|Uh-huh. Sure, yeah.
A|Oh, my.
B|Right, right.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right.
A|Yeah, it, and it if you, um, well, first of all I take about a quarter and a half of milk and I put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat.
B|But, But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
A|Uh-huh.
B|When the days start getting a little longer, you know, you can, I can start doing it in the evening after work.
A|And I thought it was a good sacrifice to make, because, um, it was important to me to, to spend some time with kids.
B|And over half of it has been drug related.
A|Yeah.
B|I'm surprised. My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
A|In Richardson there.
B|They plead insanity
A|Yeah. Well, you may be right. What I think is really going to be interesting is to see how, uh, we as a society deal with it and I, and I think it is, what you say, it's, it's a,
B|Yes. So would I.
A|Yeah. Yeah, we'll see then. Yeah, right now I'm stuck, I, I've got a, a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing. But it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the Saturn.
B|but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual  uh, reunion.
A|not too bad. Yeah. Uh-huh.
B|and, uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area and, uh, uh,  so it's,   Not too bad,
A|Yeah.
B|Have you recently bought a new car Catherine?
A|I have one that's a freshman in high school, a daughter. And a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school.
B|Well, uh, the, the only I can, I you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing I can possibly think of. Uh, like I said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd. There's no way that could work.
A|Do you have annual family reunions or,
B|Hi, fine, I'm Nancy. How are you?
A|And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.
B|During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|No, no.
B|Oh, uh-huh.
A|or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.
B|Oh really?
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
B|Exactly. Uh-huh, exactly. Uh,
A|Oh, you're kidding Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there, I mean, what it's,
B|Absolutely not, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, if you hired me I'll be, you know, supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess.
A|Um, can you, uh, hang on again
B|Twelve children?
