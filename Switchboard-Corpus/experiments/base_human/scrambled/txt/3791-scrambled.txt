A|Huh. You learn  something every day.
B|Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure, I will.
A|Uh-huh.
B|so it's a good experience.
A|Wow.
B|Okay, nice talking to you.
A|Yeah, yeah. That's probably where you've used it.
B|and it is good.
A|okay. Bye-bye
B|Bye, now.
A|Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full
B|Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,
A|Oh, I agree. I think that people are getting off too easy. They're getting, they're getting paroled too easily.
B|But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
A|And, uh, where are you from?
B|Uh-huh. What's so sad about this is both of the, the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but,  their training isn't what we need in this country.
A|and I just, I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful.
B|I didn't know they did this.
A|Yeah. No, I understand that totally
B|Really? Yeah. I feel that my, uh, I'm a junior in college now. And  I go to Tech, Georgia Tech?
A|Sure. Yeah.
B|Yeah. And I do, I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go,
A|Then you'll never leave.
B|Yes.
A|Yeah. They don't do that here. Course they pay them, but they don't, you don't, you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
B|and it, you know, it, people have, have really quieted down after everything started but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Okay.
A|Oh, yeah. Okay.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right, and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents.
A|No.
B|But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery. Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries. You know.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Yeah. Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?
A|Oh, I don't know, is it, do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
B|And, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
A|Yeah, that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler
B|Uh, I remember seeing that,
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|And have, you know, like three or four couples come over, and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like
A|It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, and you slept on the train at night.
B|Yeah. Yeah, yeah. From what I understand, they act up pretty bad
A|Huh. Yeah, no, they, um, the strawberries are coming in season now from , they're, they're coming up from Florida, of course. I live in Vermont, so. But they're really reasonably priced, they're coming up from Florida, so.
B|Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company. I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this
A|The ,
B|No, I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.
A|You know, that's, that's totally out.
B|Right.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, absolutely. that's right.
A|Right, and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
B|And I often find that even when I don't feel that much like exercising, like I'll be really tired, and I'll start swimming, and I'll, and I'll actually get energy. And I'll be, have much more energy when I'm done than when I started, I mean, I just feel great. That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim.
A|See you next time. Bye.
B|Uh, I do too, in fact
A|Oh yes, I love my cats. I lost one, one time, uh,
B|They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
A|Uh-huh. The taxes that people don't think about that, yeah, the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
B|Yeah.
A|It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
B|Bye.
A|I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
B|Uh.
A|Yes.
B|What about you?
A|Adapt.
B|Right, now like my ... Right. Well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,
A|Wonderful place.
B|He says yeah, but then I wouldn't have you, I go, yeah, but then you would have a lot of money
A|Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.
B|so, I don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live. Um, so, now, since, uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, um,
A|Yeah. Uh-huh Right. Yeah. That would be neat, sure.
B|So I guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier I guess.
A|I know where you mean. There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner, that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up?
B|Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
A|and they're being put in the middle of the city
B|Oh, really?
A|I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
B|Uh-huh. Oh, yeah they're always in Florida. Florida and Louisiana, I think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.
A|Huh. No.
B|Yeah, but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but,
A|Wonderful. Yes.
