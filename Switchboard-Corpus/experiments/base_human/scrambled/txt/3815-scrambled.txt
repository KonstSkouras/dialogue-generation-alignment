A|It takes a, yeah, it does take some space.
B|And, uh, whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
A|Oh.
B|So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
A|Well, that's probably true.
B|I mean they really had some great opportunities. But, what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,
A|Uh-huh. That's right. Absolutely. They need, young families, whatever,
B|Well, I haven't either, uh, I, I hate returning things.
A|It fluffs up, and it's really moist.
B|And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, but I still feel, you know, it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something
A|Well it will make, it will make them taste better I'm sure.
B|Well, uh, say, embezzlement, right. You get a guy down the street who comes up, uh, carrying a
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
A|Well, I am new to Texas, so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,
B|Oh, really?
A|Uh-huh.
B|And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.
B|Not a thing, goodness gracious.
A|Uh. Yeah.
B|Sure. Uh-huh.
A|and I really, you know, they don't understand, uh, how other people live, um, they don't understand,
B|Right, exactly.
A|So But.
B|Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system.
A|And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe. It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
B|And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.
A|Uh-huh.
B|So have you got a pet.
A|so.
B|I was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the, Montgomery County Public Schools makes, and I'm not, this is, uh, the figure, he makes eighty thousand dollars a year.
A|Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right.
B|I, I've, one thing, when, when I have run and jogged, uh, I've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do, I, I've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, I write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. The, it's
A|I may still be, um, we,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Huh.
B|Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment.
A|so we just, you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. And something major, always needs to be done.
B|Uh-huh.
A|But, I'm sure that's fun.
B|Trying to remember we had a dog for a while, and I don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it, my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,
A|In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news
B|I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas, but basically he does all the heavy stuff, and I do all the fun stuff
A|I don't know. What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?
B|Right, uh-huh. A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.
A|Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas, and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, and of course it was definitely there. So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. I don't know what the answer is. I know that it's scary, and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
B|What about Utah?
A|also saves a lot of time with commercials.
B|Yeah, I don't think we,
A|Uh-huh. Huh. Uh-huh.
B|They were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy,
A|Uh-huh. That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
B|Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
A|Yeah, I think the, uh, actually I think they get, um, some of them from South America.
B|I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles.
A|And then I was going to make other things like potato skins.
B|and I like it. And what I've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this, uh, Asian center that, a Doctor Falk has started, that works with the school district.
A|How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually, because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania
B|Well, that's happened before.
A|There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,
