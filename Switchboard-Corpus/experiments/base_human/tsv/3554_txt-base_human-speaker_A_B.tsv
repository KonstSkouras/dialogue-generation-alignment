B:	Well, um, I have a, a, a former exercise program. I'm a graduate student, and this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise. Um, last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard, so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and, um, and since I worked at a recreation center I could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often. But, um. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
A:	and and it's least hard on your body,
B:	Uh-huh, and there's and there's no jarring on the.
A:	I,
B:	Pardon?
A:	It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
B:	Exactly, yeah, um,
A:	and
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
A:	Right, right.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. How about you?
A:	Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
A:	but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
A:	I like it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I like it, uh, part of my problem is I have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
B:	Uh-huh. Sure, yeah.
A:	Of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
A:	Right, you don't notice it  as much,
B:	, yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it and,
A:	You feel it, don't you?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
B:	Yeah, there are. Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
A:	Do you enjoy it, or is it, uh. If you can have, find the time it's just the.
B:	Uh-huh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
A:	Yeah, it is hard
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	it is hard. It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
B:	Exactly.
A:	Don't get enough sleep as it is, right
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. Yeah, yeah.
A:	If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
A:	I do. I have to be real careful.
B:	Uh-huh. I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
A:	Did you?
B:	Uh-huh, completely. I mean, any kind of meat or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
A:	Makes a lot of difference.
B:	Yeah, it really does.
A:	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
A:	Right.
B:	and so. I found that really helps.
A:	And unless you really like, uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
B:	Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
A:	Kind of see what happens.
B:	Yeah, and I like it.
A:	I've tried to do that with sugar
B:	I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
A:	everything has sugar in it . I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	Course, and I like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but. Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
B:	Okay, yeah, it sounds good.
A:	Okay.
B:	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
A:	Well, you, too. Good luck, uh, enjoy college while you can. Let me tell you it's, uh.
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
A:	It's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
B:	Yeah. Yeah, it is. Well, it's good talking,
A:	Where are you going studying?
B:	Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
A:	Right.
