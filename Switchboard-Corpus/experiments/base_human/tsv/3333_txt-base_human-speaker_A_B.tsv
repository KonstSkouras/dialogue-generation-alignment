A:	All right. I've never done it before, so I guess that's all I have to do, right
B:	I guess so.
A:	I've been called several times, and I push in, pushed in my number, they kept saying you have the invalid code
B:	Oh, really.
A:	and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.
B:	Oh
A:	Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
B:	I think five minutes is the max.
A:	Oh, no, I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, do you know?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
A:	Yeah, okay, well back to crime, I guess we're supposed to talk about that. They say what aspect are you worried about, well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect
B:	Right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
A:	I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.
B:	Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
A:	Uh-huh, golly I know.
B:	and,
A:	Have they done that in Garland?
B:	No, I, not that I'm aware of.
A:	Now, um,
B:	I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
A:	Right.
B:	so, um,
A:	Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.
B:	Is that right?
A:	And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school, so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
A:	So. Yeah, it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot. I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
B:	I know
A:	What next?
B:	I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, and it just continues to get worse.
A:	Right, and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, they just can't do it.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
B:	Right.
A:	and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.
B:	Yeah, that's, I I agree, I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children
A:	Uh-huh. Right and,
B:	and that may impact it as well.
A:	I think so, and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.
B:	Right, right.
A:	These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
B:	Yeah
A:	I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
B:	they don't think twice about it. Yeah. Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
A:	I think it was just rare, I really do.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now. She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California, and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her, and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, and, uh,
B:	You're kidding.
A:	No, I'm the one,
B:	Himself and her?
A:	Yeah, that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
B:	Oh, wow, I bet.
A:	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas
B:	Oh, I know,
A:	it's just, you know, another killing.
B:	Well, they were, I was watching some show the other day, and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,
A:	Um. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, lots of their picture and life story and everything.
B:	Right, and then you get to their life story, Oh, they came from a broken family
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	oh this person had mental problems
A:	Right.
B:	oh duh, duh, duh you know,
A:	Right. I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah, I think it was on a Hard Copy, she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,
B:	Uh, I remember seeing that,
A:	Remember that?
B:	I saw that on Hard Copy
A:	Right, right, that's, uh,
B:	Yes.
A:	My daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School.
B:	Is that right?
A:	Yeah, can you believe it, that's just, uh,
B:	I'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something
A:	Taco Bueno, right, uh-huh.
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
B:	I remember seeing that.
A:	Yeah, uh, uh, isn't that weird?
B:	Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
A:	I know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. You know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And there are times I think, gee, I should give my kids
