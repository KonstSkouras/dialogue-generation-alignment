B:	Hi, well, I guess, which one have you got right now? Or,
A:	Well, I, uh, couple of them, I, at the moment, use an A S T two eighty-six and I got a leading edge and I got a American one and had a I B M one, but
B:	My, my, just a couple.
A:	What do you have
B:	Uh, I've got an Omega and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four eighty-six machine.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah, it's very, very generic.
A:	What did you do, put it together?
B:	Yeah, and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine
A:	Well, that's, Yeah.
B:	That's all I got to say for it.
A:	Yeah. What do you use it for?
B:	Huh?
A:	What do you use it for?
B:	Uh, work, uh, I'm a contract programmer.
A:	Oh, yeah? What kind of programs do you,
B:	Uh, anything
A:	Okay, I mean like business programs or, Man.
B:	Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens. It was kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh,
B:	Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
A:	Huh. Well, that's, Well, that sounds interesting. Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
B:	Oh, yeah, definitely.
A:	That's where the speed helps out.
B:	Uh, yeah, unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six. It's like slow out the
A:	Yep, that will, that will, slow you up
B:	Huh?
A:	Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, really need a faster system. Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
B:	I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.
A:	Who is that?
B:	Uh, his name is T Q or something like that. And my notebook is somewhere around here See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.
A:	I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
B:	Uh, he's, uh, up in, Huh?
A:	That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them. They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
B:	Oh, that works.
A:	that's why I have so many different levels of P C around at the moment.
B:	Uh, here it is. A T S Computers.
A:	A T S?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And where are they at?
B:	Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Okay, he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer. And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.
A:	In Richardson there.
B:	Huh?
A:	In Richardson?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know where you mean. There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner, that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.
B:	Right, it's, it's, it's just south of there.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's a little place, looks like a castle.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Kind of, uh, little guy in there. He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
A:	Oh.
B:	Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
A:	Really? Well, that's a good deal.
B:	Yeah, it was pretty reasonable.
A:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, uh, he, and he does a good job and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.
A:	Uh, there is a lot, you ever go by Lucky Computer there?
B:	Uh-huh, yeah.
A:	I used to, when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days. But I, ,
B:	Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.
A:	I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.
B:	Uh-huh, oh, yeah, I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in, you know, it's like, wow
A:	Yeah.
B:	That works, I'll go do that
A:	I,
B:	And boy that thing screams now.
A:	Yeah, I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six. That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
A:	Is that right? That's it?
B:	Yeah, it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	I'll be darned.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Huh, well,
