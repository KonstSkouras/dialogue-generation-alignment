A|0| A: Wow . 
B|1| B: _Oh_ . 
A|2| A: _Yeah_ , _so_ _I_ _just_ wondered _, you know _,_ if_ _the_ whole area _was_ _like_ _that_ or , 
B|3| B: _So_ _it's_ _nice_ _to have [,_ you know ,] _one_ place [that] [you] can _take_ _them_ _all_ _to_ instead _of_ driving [the] glass _to_ _one_ place 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ _There's_ _a _lot_ of_ [that] _going_ on _in_ Dallas , too . 
B|5| B: _Yes ._ 
A|6| A: _Yeah_ , _so_ , TWIN PEAKS , um , what happened _was_ _, I think_ , TWIN PEAKS , um , went , went off _, they_ moved [to] _a_ Saturday night _for_ _a_ while . _And_ _then_ put , and _then_ put something _, _I_ guess_ , GABRIEL'S FIRE on _it_ , and _at_ Thursday nights , and _then_ _they_ moved , um , _no_ , GABRIEL'S FIRE _was_ on C B S _, I think_ _, I_ _, I_ [take] [that] _back_ . I'm not sure , but anyway _they_ moved _it_ _back_ and forth and _that's_ when PEAKS _was_ _back_ _in_ [that] time slot as well . _So _,_ I_ _don't_ [know] . 
B|7| B: [So _,] it was_ _real_ _nice_ . 
A|8| A: _I_ mean , as _a_ matter [of] fact _, that's_ what we're _doing_ tonight 
B|9| B: _Well [,_ I] _really_ , [the] _last_ car _we_ _got_ _was a_ , _was a_ _used_ car _. I_ _really_ [don't] prefer buying [a] new car _. I_ [like] [to] let _somebody_ else _pay for_ [that] 
A|10| A: You're _, uh ,_ everybody [I] speak [to] _is_ _in_ Texas , oh , oh , yeah , but I'm , I'm _in New York_ and _, uh ,_ [we] seem , [we] seem [to have ,] um _, I think_ [the] AMERICAN GLADIATORS _is_ on Sunday afternoons actually around here as well , sometimes . 
B|11| B: Now [uh] _Well_ [I] [I] still _go_ [back] [to] ... 
A|12| A: and [, you know [,] I] would get hung up by my boot straps _if_ [I] _if_ [I] ever mentioned [the] Ford product _in_ my family . 
B|13| B: _Oh , that's_ great . 
A|14| A: That , For , oh , _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: Emmett Smith . 
A|16| A: [Well ,] [we] [have] this philosophy , [we] use [it] when [we] [go] off somewhere but [we] [pay for] [it] as soon as [we] come [back] [, you know ,] as soon as [we] get _our_ bills , [we] [pay] [it] off . 
B|17| B: [I guess] [so] . 
A|18| A: _Right ._ 
B|19| B: [And] [if] [they] were _in the_ same building [then] [you] are _going to_ [the] same place , 
A|20| A: _Right ._ 
B|21| B: Um . 
A|22| A: [So ,] um [, I] always _think_ _it's a_ [nice] break from [the] traditional organ or piano . 
B|23| B: [Yeah] 
A|24| A: Vision [, [I] guess] [it's] called , vision care . 
B|25| B: [There's] [no] question [, I think] [that's] _really_ [the] best . If [, _if] a_ woman [is] happy [doing] [that] , 
A|26| A: [Oh ,] okay , my my dog , [last] German Shepherd [, it [was] a] [real] chore trying [to] give him [a] bath too . [And] [that] [was] [the] thing [I] couldn't figure out because he would [go] [in the] lake [, it] wasn't [like] he _didn't_ 
B|27| B: _like _,_ you know , _they_ just_ change [the] pronunciation [a] little bit . 
A|28| A: [so] [they just] felt absolutely awful . 
B|29| B: Chili . 
A|30| A: Do [you] _, uh ,_ _do you_ ride or _do you_ pull [a] cart when [you] play golf ? 
B|31| B: _I didn't_ , 
A|32| A: _Right _._ I [know_ ,] how [we] and straighten up [all] these twisted people before [they] _do_ something terrible , 
B|33| B: Um , Kalachandji's . It's _, uh , [it's_ a] Hari Krishna run restaurant . 
A|34| A: [I think] _they're_ [real] reasonably priced , some [of] [them] [, they] [used] [to] be [a] hundred dollars and [they] [used] [to] whip skim milk into [a] dessert but [I didn't] get [that] [one] [, I] [got] [the] Black and Decker kind . But [, uh , it's] [real] handy because [it] doesn't [have] [a] cord and [you] beat this cornstarch right into [the] [the] milk [, you know ,] and [it] does an excellent job , or [just] hand beat [it] [. [I] guess] [you] could use [a] hand mixer but [I] [don't] [think] [it] [I] [don't] [think] [it] gets [it] _good_ enough . 
B|35| B:  . [Yeah] [. I know] [that] they've , [they're] looking [at] [, uh [,] uh [,] you know [,] uh [,] you know ,] better running automobiles . 
A|36| A: [And] I'm kind [of] [like ,] yeah [. I] shall [, they] would _do_ [that] because [at] least [somebody] [was] getting [the] money out [of] [it] [, you know] . That [was] [going to] use [it] [for] _good_ , [so] , 
B|37| B: [Yeah] . 
A|38| A: [Oh , that's] neat . 
B|39| B: Here [in New York] [it's [a] lot] harder than [that] [, uh] 
A|40| A: But [, it's] [the] cases [, you know ,] [like] sometimes [you] [, you know [,] you] hear [of] people [that] [they] say [they] went [to] jail falsely [, you know , they] [really] [didn't] _do_ [it] . [Well [,] you know [,] you] [, you] [got] [, you] [got] [that] point well [, you know ,] what , what [if a] mistake [is] made and [you] put someone [, you know ,] [to] death [that] [really] [didn't] _do_ [it] . 
B|41| B: [Yeah] . 
A|42| A: _Right ._ 
B|43| B: [Right .] [Right .] [Right .] 
A|44| A: [Oh [,] I] see . _Uh-huh ._ [Well ,] very _good_ [, I think] we've probably [know ,] [know] each other's exercise habits 
B|45| B: [I] [do] . 
A|46| A: We [don't] [have [,] [I] guess] too much trouble [in] Dallas with , well [, [I] guess] [, [I] guess] [we] [do] [have] [a _lot] of_ people come [in] from Mexico , [that] cause problems , but [, uh] . 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] That's [good] . 
A|48| A: [And] [then] when [I] put [the] verandas which will be twelve feet out [all] [the] way around on [the] north , south and east sides [that] will define [the] shop . 
B|49| B: How long [do you] [have] [to] bake [it] ? 
A|50| A: [Well ,] he's from here . 
B|51| B: A [lot of] [our] words are [the] same ,
