B|17| B: Crazy . Uh , well _, is_ [there] anything else you'd [like] [to] share _me_ [about] your recycling philosophy , Julie ? 
A|18| A: That _don't _,_ _it_ _,_ _it_ _,_ _it_ seems_ [like [,] _I] mean ,_ [if] wrestling [is] prime [time] , professional wrestling _, _it_ seems_ [like] [it's] _just_ _, just_ _, just_ [like] pros _in a_ wrestling _to me_ [, _I] don't [,_ _I] don't_ [see] _any_ difference though , 
B|19| B: Uh _, where_ [I] live now _it's _,_ it's_ _not_ _so_ bad _. [I_ mean] [I can] basically leave _my_ front door unlocked [and] _not_ [have] [to] worry [about] _it ._ Uh [, _but] [I_ do have] friends [that] live _in the_ city [and [I] _think] that_ [they] [get [a] lot of] fallout _from_ _this_ [war] [on] _drug_ [thing] . Uh [, just] _because_ [there] [are] _, [like_ ,] crack houses [, you know ,] [on] their street [and] stuff [like] _this_ . 
A|20| A: [and] [we] decided [that] _I [,_ I've] never [been] [to] Africa [and I] needed _to get_ [that] continent [since] [I] hadn't [been] [there] yet _. And_ _it _,_ it's _,_ actually_ [it's] [a] fairly common vacation _place_ _for_ French _people to_ _go_ [and they] speak French [and ,] _so [,_ uh [,] you know _,] in_ [that] sense [is] [just] _a little bit_ easier 
B|21| B: _Um _,_ yeah ._ 
A|22| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|23| B: Huh . 
A|24| A: Absolutely . They [really] _go_ through _it ,_ 
B|25| B: _I'm_ building our [house] _right_ now _and I'm_ [going to] incorporate _into_ _my_ [, uh ,] garage area [a] weight activated [, uh ,] crusher . 
A|26| A: With [the] company _than_ , _than_ having [to] _go_ , _That's_ , that's [right] . _Yes_ [, _I] ,_ agree [with] _that ._ 
B|27| B: [So] [it seems] [to me] [that] while [those] changes [are] taking [place] , maybe _we're_ _not_ well preparing [people _to] make_ [the] changes [with] [them] . 
A|28| A: That [is] _for_ sure . 
B|29| B: [I] _made_ [a [,] I] _made_ [a] fourth bedroom [out of] [, uh _,] a_ _made_ [a] fourth bedroom [out of] _one of_ our , [out of] our _living_ [room] [and then] added [a [,] uh _,] what_ [we] call [a] sunroom [to get] [the [,] you know ,] 
A|30| A: [So] _, _not_ [,_ _I] , _I_ mean _,_ _I'm_ ,_ [the] problem [is] [I] _can't_ guarantee [that] [a] judge [would] [be] necessarily [be] _much_ _better_ _than_ [a] jury [, but] I'd [be] _real_ nervous having [a] jury [not] [at] least fully agree [on] [what] [the] settlements [would] _be ,_ things [like] _that ._ 
B|31| B: How [about] yourself ? 
A|32| A: [Yeah .] 
B|33| B: [That's] interesting [, I] almost lost our electricity _here ._ 
A|34| A: _Well_ [the] puppy jumped [in [the] ,] [into] _some of the_ pools [but] [not] [into] [the [,] _I] was_ careful [to] keep her away [from] [the ,] [the] fast moving water , 
B|35| B: _Yeah ,_ well _, he's_ _, he's_ [out] [for] cardboard . 
A|36| A: What [, what] [do] [you] [think] ? [Oh [,] yeah [.] Yeah .] 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: _and I was_ [, _I] was_ [there] [this] [, uh ,] summer _and , uh [,_ _I] was_ [really] impressed _by [the_ [,] uh ,] [the [,] uh ,] factory [, uh ,] tours [and] such [for] [B] M W . 
B|39| B: [And] [it's] pretty cool . 
A|40| A: The , [the] investigator _. Yeah _,_ he_ _, he_ _got_ off [right] away . 
B|41| B: Uh _, _for_ [the_ [,] and] [so [,] _you] ,_ [on] [that] [it's] [not] unusual _, for_ example _, for_ somewhere around _here_ [on] [a ,] [on] [a ,] [on] [a [,] what] [we] [would [,] you know [,] what] [you] described [as] your [house] [and] [what] [I] [would] describe [as] _my_ [house] say _, for_ example [, in] Pensacola , Florida , [on] [that] [house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] [so] forth [and] [so] [on] , might pay _three_ [or] four hundred dollars [a] year taxes . maybe [, you know ,] maybe [a little bit] higher [than] [that] now , 
A|42| A: _Yes_ 
B|43| B: Some [of [the] ,] [some of the] best food _I have_ ever _had_ [was] [out of] [a ,] outside [or] inside [of] [a] [place] [that] [we] drove [up] [and I was] [like [,] _I'm] not_ eating [in] [there] Are [you] nuts ? [And , uh ,] [we] went [in] [and] [it] [was] [the] [it] [was] [the] [most] wonderful food . 
A|44| A: [but] _he_ doesn't bite anybody [he's] [just] [, he's] _just kind of_ [there] , _real_ friendly [and] docile . 
B|45| B: "I said , ""Hey , wouldn't _you like_ [to] [know] what's happening [with] [these people] ? "" ""Yeah [, but] [I'm [,] you know [,] it's] too [much] trouble . "" [So I] [got] busy , [got] together [, and] put [a] reunion together [for] his [family] [.

A|46| A: [But] [, _but] [,_ yeah ,] substantially [, you know .] [Um ,] [do] [you like] [living] [in] _an_ older home [and] restoring [it] [like] [that] ? 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right] . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [You] probably [can't] afford [to] eat [if] _you have_ _more_ [than] _two_ [of them] 
A|50| A: _It's like_ [a] Macy's , [kind of] store , 
B|51| B: [You] _had_ eight boys _and one_ girl ? 
A|52| A: [And] that's [, you know ,] that's [the] way [they] wanted [to _do] [it_ [.] And] _he_ [was] surprised [because] _he_ thought [there] [was] [going to] [be] [a] problem [because] _he_ [, uh [,] you know] [some] [people] _on the_ case [were] , [were] [a little] hesitant [on] convicting him [on] [some of the] charges [but [I] mean] _when_ [it] [all] came [down ,] [they] [just] , within _an_ hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|53| B: [Yes] . [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: Okay , how [do] [you] _feel_ [about] [them] ? 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: _have _a_ good_ weekend . 
B|57| B: [So] [you] [can] still [get [a] ,] [get [a] _,] [a_ good] [house] [for] [a] very , very reasonable price [. And] [I mean] [good] [, I] [would ,] let's say typical , say _three_ bedroom [, uh ,] _two_ [and] [a] half baths , [on] [a] half acre [or] [so] [of] land [uh ,] reasonable construction [would] probably [run] _you [,_ uh ,] [right] now anywhere between , somewhere between [a] hundred [and] [a] hundred [and] forty thousand dollars [. And] probably , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
A|58| A: [Oh] . 
B|59| B: _Yeah . [I_ , I] usually [get] [it] started [for] _my_ wife 
A|60| A: [Yeah .] We're doing [some] [here] [in] [, in] Cash Valley , [the] community [here .] 
B|61| B: Lots [of] wildlife huh ? [Yeah .] 
A|62| A: [But] , pumping [more] money [into] [the] school system [is] [a good] [thing] , 
B|63| B: No . Usually busy fighting [for] survival . 
A|64| A: [Oh ,] [they] help [you] . 
B|65| B: Now _we've_ _had_ _one_ lately [, um ,] oh _, [a_ [,] uh _,] a_ Dustbuster Plus [that] [we] bought , 
A|66| A: [I] read [my] newspaper [. [I] can] hardly wait [in the] mornings [for the] newspaper [to get] _here [,_ you know .] 
B|67| B: Are [you] serious ? 
A|68| A: _Well _,_ no_ [, _I] don't_ [think] [they] [can] , [they] [can] force _another_ company [to] [not] [drug] test [me] [just] _by_ saying [that] [I , I] [didn't] [, _I] mean ,_ 
B|69| B: [Yeah ,] [right] , [right] , 
A|70| A: [Yeah . _I] think it_ [made] [about] [three] minutes [on] [one [of] the] national news stations [or something] [and , and] [we've] [been] _in a_ state [of] emergency [for] over [, you know [,] for] ten [or] eleven _days_ . 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah [,] _it] is_ . 
A|74| A: [Oh] 
B|75| B: [Oh [, I] do] too 
A|76| A: [And] [since] [we] _go_ [there] [all] _the time_ [, [I] mean] 
B|77| B: [I , I] shouldn't say innocent , [because] [I mean [,] actually] [if they] commit [a] crime [that] they're [in [the] same] circumstances [but ,] 
A|78| A: [and] [you [,] there] [were] [some] places [, where] [people] , 
B|79| B: [It's] [not [,] not] [to me] personally [, no] . 
A|80| A: _Well [,_ [I] have] [this] new fondue pot [and I was] [going [to] do] basic cheese fondue [, [and] [I] have] [two] different _kinds of_ breads [and] [some] ham [and I was] [going to] try [something] weird _which_ [, you know _,] when_ [you have] fish au gratin [, [I] was] [going [to] make] [some] [, uh [,] like] fish chunks [and] dip [it] [in the] fondue [. _I] don't_ [know] [if] [it] _will_ [come] [out] . 
B|81| B: [It's] [just kind of] [, uh ,] _we're_ supposed [to] [have _a] chance to get_ [some] rain [the] next couple [of] [days] [here [,] uh ,] [which] [will] _be _, you know ,_ [a_ little bit] [more] typical [, uh ,] autumn weather . [But] [really] [it's] strange . We haven't [really] _had_ [an] autumn . [It's _like] we_ went [into] winter 
A|82| A: _Well [,_ [and] [one] [of] the] things I'd [, [and] I'm] [with] [you] [that] _I don't_ [know] [is] [, is] [that] [really] [the] only way [it's] [being] transmitted [or] [was] _that the_ easier way [to] tell us [and] [we're] [going to] _find_ [out] [more] . 
B|83| B: [Well] [I [have] a] bunch [of] computer journals [because] [I'm] [in] computer science 
A|84| A: Of course [, you] [got] [a little] different direction [going] [, [but] [,] uh] . 
B|85| B: [I think] [in] [and] [it [,] just] [would] depend upon [the] circumstances [and , and] [the] extent [of the] abuse [and , and] [if] [another] alternative [was] available . 
A|86| A: [That's] [right] [. Yeah .] 
B|87| B: [I] [know] [I'm] always scared [of] [that] whenever [I] [go] [to] [a] game [. I] rarely [go] [but] [we] went last year [because] [my] [brother] , [my] [brother] [is] impossible [, when] [, um [,] he] [does] football leagues [and] baseball leagues [and] [all] [kinds of] stuff , 
A|88| A: [Oh ,] [you're] kidding _Well ,_ [do] [you] mind [if] [I] ask [what] [it's] _worth_ [down] [there] [, [I] mean [,] what] [it's ,] 
B|89| B: They're [real] [good] [, but] [they] [do] [come] [on] [kind of] late [, but] [we] [really] [do] enjoy [those] . Sometimes [we] [get] [to] watching [some] stuff [on the] Discovery Channel . 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: Nevertheless [you] maintain [that] [it's] _it is_ [the] [right] [of] _of any_ citizen [to] burn [the] symbol [of] their country . 
A|92| A: [I'm not] sure [they] need [to] [be , you know ,] paid [, you know , a] super [do] salary [of any] [kind] . 
B|93| B: [Yeah [,] I've] [, I've] heard [of] [that .] 
A|94| A: _Well ,_ [do] [you] [think _that] [,_ um [,] it] should [be] [like we] [have] [this] sort [of] random spot testing type [of] [thing] [or] [do] [you] _think it_ [would] [be] [more] palatable [if] [we] [had] [some] sort [of] regular [schedule] [or] [would] [that] [just] allow everybody [a chance to get] [out of] [it] ? 
B|95| B: [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: [but] [then] _when I_ travel [it is] [a little] different situation . 
B|97| B: [Well [,] it's [,] uh [,] it's] [really] both . [I'm] certainly driven [by the] desire [to] maintain [my] weight [and] [be] healthy [and] [be] [in] shape [, [and] , uh [,] and] [most] [of [the] time] [I] enjoy [it .] Sometimes [I don't [,] [but] [I] feel [that] [,] uh ,] [that the] discipline [it] affords [me] [when [I] [do] it] [when [I] don't] want [to] [is] also [worth] [something] . 
A|98| A: [That's] funny . 
B|99| B: [Right] . 
A|100| A: [Oh ,] [really] . 
B|101| B: [I] [find] [that] [when I] ride [in a] cart [, I] play [better] [and [I] think [it] is] cause [I don't] [get] [as] tired
