A|30| A: It _depends_ [on] _who_ examines [your] eyes . 
B|31| B: [and] _now_ _I don't_ _let_ [my] kids _out_ _of the_ front yard _, _that_ _I_ can't_ _see_ [them] . 
A|32| A: [I don't] [see] _someone_ [not] _going_ _out there_ [and] committing murder _because_ _they're_ afraid _they're_ _going_ [to get] sentenced [to] death _. I_ mean , most [people] _out there_ committing murders [don't] care . 
B|33| B: [I'm] _for_ [it] [in] [in] some cases . 
A|34| A: [and _I] know_ she's eating [the] _right_ [things] [, and] _her_ doctor's _right_ _there_ _where_ _he_ can come [in] [and] check [on] _her [,_ so] .

B|35| B: [It's] [a] long skinny [one] _and ,_ 
A|36| A: [Okay] 
B|37| B: [It's] [like _,] well _,_ I can't_ _really_ _give_ [you] [a] recipe [, uh]

B|39| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: _Right ._ [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: That [that] _might_ [be a] _better_ _way to do it ._ 
A|42| A: _Well , I_ [just] found [out] [that] [my] car [like] [an] old [was] thirty months old [, and] [it] doesn't _seem like_ [it's] [that] old . 
B|43| B: [I know] [they're] [doing] some curbside recycling _as a_ [kind of] [a] test [there] . 
A|44| A: I'll [let] [you] go first . 
B|45| B: [Yeah .] 
A|46| A: Do _what_ [now] ? 
B|47| B: [I] wish [I] _could_ [do] [something like _that] _,_ _but_ _I_ can't_ [, so] 
A|48| A: _Oh_ . Do [you] _have_ brothers [and] sisters ? 
B|49| B: [I guess] [that's] _how_ [it] gets passed [on] [. You know _,] when_ [one] person [, you] hear [from] [another] person 
A|50| A: That's [really] hard _I think_ _, because_ , especially [if] [you] _start_ [them] [and] then [they] [get] [pretty] [good] [and] then [they] [get] _close_ , _ten_ _, you know ,_ eleven or [something] _, they_ go _, I don't_ _want [to_ do] [this] anymore [and] you're [like] God [, I] [really] _want_ [you] [to do it .] 
B|51| B: _And [,_ you know , you] [just] [see] _those_ kids [going] [down] [the] road . Now , [not] [all] [of] [them] will commit offenses [that] _have [to_ do] _with_ capital punishment _, but_ some [of] [them] [have] already [been] [in] youth centers _. And_ [that] [kind of] _thing ,_ 
A|52| A: Course [it] doesn't _always_ work [out] [in] their favor . 
B|53| B: [and _I] was_ disappointed _when _I_ went_ [to] Texas [. I] didn't [see] [that] [many] [of] [them] . 
A|54| A: _but _I don't_ like_ using [them] _because_ _I've_ seen _too_ [many] [people] [that] used [them] [and] ended _up_ bankrupt or [on] , chapter thirteen [and] stuff [like _that] ._ 
B|55| B: _So_ [I] wasn't sure _when_ [to] [start] [her] [. I] didn't [want to] push [her] [too] early , either _, but_ [, uh ,] [kind of] _had a_ mixed feelings [about that] scene . 
A|56| A: _Oh_ [people] , 
B|57| B: All [right .] 
A|58| A: _So _,_ it's_ difficult _, it_ [really] [is] [and] [we're] [all] heading [that] [way] [and ,] 
B|59| B: [Oh] no . 
A|60| A: _Uh [,_ I can't] remember . Refresh [my] memory . 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh .] Huh , [we] _don't ,_ 
A|62| A: _How_ far , _where_ [is] Clarion County [in] relation [to ,] actually _, because_ [we're] considering moving [to] Pennsylvania 
B|63| B: Besides which [, it] [would be] easier [, uh ,] there's _a lot of_ single mothers [out there] [now] , [from] divorces [and] _a lot of_ , women are starting _to have_ babies without [a] partner . 
A|64| A: Because by [the] vanilla doesn't _seem_ [to] thicken [as] [well] [as] _the ,_ sometimes [the] cocoa [is] [like ,] [my husband] [really] _likes_ [it] thick _he_ says [, I] can stick [the] spoon [right] [in] [this] . 
B|65| B: [So] [what] , [what] _, how_ [do] [you] _spend_ [the] time _with_ [your] _children_ ? 
A|66| A: [You] feel invigorated [and] [you] feel [oh [,] you] feel [in] [a lot] [better] shape [just] [like] eating [right] foods . 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [And] [really] [, that's] [about] [, that's] [really] [about] [it .] _Is_ [there] anything , _any_ place else [that] [really] _takes_ anything _other_ _than_ _that , _that_ [you_ know] [of] ? 
B|69| B: two cats [and] [just] [as] easy [it] [just] [never] started smelling [, I] [would] _put_ [just] [a] little bit [of] cat litter [in] [there] [, because] [if] [I] _put_ [a lot] , [one] _of the_ cats [would] [have] _been ,_ 
A|70| A: [You know] . [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: _But [,_ you know ,] [if] , [a ,] _a lot of_ [people] flat [can't] afford [to] . 
A|72| A: That's [, uh ,] only [way to do it .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah _,] yeah_ 
A|74| A: Like [, I] remember [a] friend [of] mine _at_ work telling _me_ [that] _at_ his frat [in] college [that] [they] [had a] tank [of] piranha [, and _,] uh , you know ,_ used [to] drop mice [in] 
B|75| B: _Yeah . And_ [she] still [likes] [to get] TIME which [I've never] liked _very_ _much_ 
A|76| A: [Well [,] the] only [, uh ,] references [that I] [have] seen lately has [been [,] uh ,] _in ,_ _part_ [of the] overmilitarization [of] Iraq [was] due [to] companies selling [them] arms [and] [things] [, and [,] and] [they] made references [to] _in the_ past [, how] _we have_ given arms [to , uh ,] Nicaragua [and] [to] _other_ places [in] Latin America [, and] [that] [those] [might] turn around [and] haunt us someday . 
B|77| B: [Well [,] they] [might] tell [you] [it's] random . 
A|78| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [And] while [he] [was] gone _, he_ [had] looked , _went_ _looking_ [for] [a] job [and] stopped [at the] _store_ [, that's] [what] [it] [was] _. And [,_ uh ,] [someone] [who] [was] [in the] neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , _went [in_ ,] raped [the] girl , murdered [her [,] [and] the] whole bit . 
A|80| A: Although [, he] shouldn't [be] evaluated [on] _that ._ 
B|81| B: [How] [do] [you] [, how] [, uh ,] [is] recycling done [in] [your] community ? [Is] , 
A|82| A: _Uh [,_ I] [play] [the] piano 
B|83| B: _But ,_ 
A|84| A: Dye Mound ? 
B|85| B: [And [I] don't [like] that] 
A|86| A: _Right_ , [as a] matter [of] fact [, [I] was] thinking [that] _same [thing_ ,] unconditional _love_ . They [just] [give] _it [,_ and] [don't] expect [too] [much] . 
B|87| B: _And [,_ uh [,] it] didn't [seem like] [it] [was] [that] congested [in] [that , that] [part] [. You know] [because] [to] [me] [where] [we] live [out] _here_ [in the] north east _, it , it's_ [there] are _a lot of_ buildings _very_ [close] [to] each [other] , 
A|88| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: Sometimes _when_ [you] lose [someone] [that you] [really] [love] [, you] [do] some crazy [things] _I don't know ,_ 
A|90| A: [Yeah .] 
B|91| B: [Well [,] I'm] [an] E S L teacher . 
A|92| A: [Yeah [. And] ,] _again _,_ I [don't_ [,] I] mean got [know] _the [,_ you know [,] how] qualified [, I] mean _, I think_ it'd [be] interesting [to [,] you know _,] to_ [spend] [a] couple [of] days [just] [looking] around [an] inner city school _. Uh [,_ you know ,] sort , sort [of] maybe [from] elementary through [, uh ,] high school [. You know ,] [just] sort [of] [to get] [a] feel [for] [what] [it's] [like] . 
B|93| B: [Oh ,] [definitely] [. [I] think] [better] even _than , than_ [other] kinds [of] food 
A|94| A: _Right_ [, and] [if] [they're] overcrowded [, well [,] you know] [they] shouldn't [have] gotten theirself [there] [in the] first place . 
B|95| B: Whatever [he] makes [, it's] [all] [out] [of the] [same thing] . 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] [Oh [,] yeah] . 
B|97| B: [Right [.] And [,] uh _,] _I don't know_ ,_ [I've] , [I've] [always] thought [that] [any] [, uh ,] [crime] [that [,] uh _,] that [,_ uh ,] intentionally [where] [someone] goes [out] [and] premeditatively [takes] [another] [life] [would be] [the] ones [where] [I think] [that] capital punishment [would be] necessary [to [keep] that] person [from] perhaps [, uh ,] [doing] [it] [again [,] and] even more [so] [to get] [people] [on] [the] outside [who] are professionals [to] realize [that [,] you know ,] there's [a ,] [a] _very_ steep penalty [to , uh ,] [be] paid _when_ [that's] done , 
A|98| A: [I don't know [,] I] [just] [think] , um , somehow [I] hoped [that] [as a] [people] [we] [could] [be] [better] [than , [than] ,] um , expecting [, the] feeling [that] [it] 
B|99| B: [So ,] 
A|100| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [Oh ,] okay [, because] [I] grew [up in] North Hollywood , California _went_ [to] U [C] L A [and] [all] [that .] 
A|102| A: [Yeah] [well] [you] can possess 'em [here] [too] [but] They [have _to] be_ [they're] registered [and] _Uh [,_ like] [uh] [the] [the] Brady Bill [that's] currently being discussed nationally [and] whatever [is] [very] [well] supported [here] , [in] gun control avenues , 
B|103| B: [So [,] I guess] [the] problem [is] [the [,] the] [thing] [to do] [is] [to] try [to , uh [,] [to] get] some [kind of] motivation [to] learn [and ,] 
A|104| A: Because [of] [all] [the] pollution [in the] lakes [and [the] ,] everywhere [. I] mean [there] isn't [any] safe haven anymore [for] fish . 
B|105| B: [Uh ,] [those] , 
A|106| A: Many [of the] boys [in the] room [had] [children] [and] [they] [were] [, they] [were] high school juniors . 
B|107| B: [Yeah .] 
A|108| A: [So [,] but] [yeah] [, it , it's] interesting [, [and] I] enjoy gardening . My son does [the] mowing [of the] grass . 
B|109| B: [Well _, I] [,_ it] [just] [depends] [. Uh [,] uh ,] roads are [very] expensive [, uh ,] commodity [and so] [is] [, uh ,] utilities [they] supply [and] police [and] fire department [, uh , you know [,] they] [need to] make [a] living . 
A|110| A: [So] [if] you're [a] nincompoop [on] trial , you'd , you'd [have [to] have] nincompoops [to , uh ,] 
B|111| B: [So [,] uh [,] I think] [the] jury selection process [is] [pretty] neat [, [but] I don't] [think] [that the] jury ought [to be] [the] ones picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
A|112| A: [No] [, I don't know] [that .] [But [,] I [,] I] must say [, that ,] um [, when] [, [when] I] did [do] [a] linguistics [course] [in ,] [in] school , ages ago , um [, the] professor [had [a] lot of] trouble [with] [my] accent . 
B|113| B: [Oh ,] pardon [me ,] [we have] forty , [we] gave [ten] [to] [one] [of] our [children] 
A|114| A: [Uh-huh .] I'd [never] heard [them] before until [I [went] in] [a] music [store] [and] [you know] [how] [you] [put] [the] headphones [on] [and] listen [to] [it]
