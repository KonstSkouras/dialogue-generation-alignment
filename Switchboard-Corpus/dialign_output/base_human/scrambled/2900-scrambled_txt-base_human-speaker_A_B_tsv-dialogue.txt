B|11| B: _Uh-huh ._

A|18| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|19| B: [yeah] 
A|20| A: [and] [we're] leasing [a] [, uh ,] two story town home [in] [a] section [of] Dallas [they] call North Dallas . 
B|21| B: [Yeah] , she [just] appeared . 
A|22| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: _Uh [,_ yes . I , I] _try to_ grow [, uh [,] uh ,] [a] vegetable garden [and ,] 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: _Yes [,_ uh ,] maybe you'll play around some [and] _figure out_ how [they] can help [you] do different things [. [I] think] that's when [you] [, you] start deciding [that] [you] [really] need greater assets than [you] already _have_ . When [you] start seeing _what_ _all_ [they] can do _for_ [you] . 
A|28| A: [and] we [were] [much] happier , 
B|29| B: [and ,] 
A|30| A: um , [they] [really] [want] [a] dog badly , [and] they've been looking [and] looking [and] [want] _, you know ,_ they'd take anything [I think] 
B|31| B: And there [would] [be] [like] thirty people _.

A|32| A: [Uh ,] oh . 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: They're not [going to] take [that] money [you] give them [and] [go] [try to] [figure out] [a] _way_ [to] dry [out] _with_ [it .] Now come [on] , let's [be] realistic , 
B|35| B: No [, I] don't [, I think] that's stupidity [on] parents' _part_ [. I] mean that's , sex [is] rampant , 
A|36| A: _That_ [, that] must [be] [a] fairly recent release . 
B|37| B: No . 
A|38| A: [Uh ,] [and [,] uh ,] so [we're] , [we're] [part] , [we're] actually [part] [of] M [I] T [. So] it's very [much] [the] same kind [of] place [and [,] uh] [the] technical institution . 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah] _, [yeah_ .] 
A|40| A: [Yes ,] [all] , [all] young Americans , [they] did not specify [, you know ,] exactly [what] young means . 
B|41| B: Okay . 
A|42| A: [Uh ,] [it] was [in] March [of] last year [. So] [, uh [,] yeah] , it'd been , didn't , didn't [have] _one_ [for] [a] whole year . 
B|43| B: [That] [way] [that] [, you know ,] [one] person wouldn't get [one] [big] blunt blow at [one] time . 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right] [and ,] 
B|45| B: [So] this [is] [the] [big] issue [with] us . Although [I] don't recall marking [it] [on] my little things [to] talk about but perhaps [they] are little [for] words [to] [be] [said] [like] day care [and] quality time [and ,]
