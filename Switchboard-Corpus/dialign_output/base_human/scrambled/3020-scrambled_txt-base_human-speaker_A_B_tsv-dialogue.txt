A|0| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|1| B: [Yeah .] 
A|2| A: [Yeah .] 
B|3| B: _Well _,_ that's_ _, uh , I_ _know_ _it's , _it's_ a_ real hard _thing_ _to do_ , _even_ _for_ _people_ _in , in , uh ,_ university communities . 
A|4| A: _So [,_ uh ,] 
B|5| B: _I always_ , _take_ _home_ baked bread . 
A|6| A: _But [,_ uh _,] you know ,_ _basically_ _the guy_ commits _, you know_ _three_ major crimes _and _,_ _and_ [, uh_ _,] and_ car theft _on_ top _of_ _it ,_ destroys _my_ car , 
B|7| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|8| A: [Well _,] it_ can _get_ expensive 
B|9| B: _and I_ totaled _them_ _all_ _up_ [and] [basically] [, uh _,] we_ _were_ _going to be_ paying seventy _or_ eighty percent tax . 
A|10| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|11| B: _yeah _,_ those_ _are_ _pretty_ _good_ _but_ true _to_ life , 
A|12| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: _I don't know_ _what_ _it's_ _like_ _now_ _, I_ haven't _been_ back _up there_ _in_ awhile . 
A|14| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: _and _,_ _and_ [,_ in] spite _of_ , 
B|17| B: _I'm sure_ _that's_ _coming_ though _. But _,_ they are_ wonderful _kids_ . 
A|18| A: _So_ [I don't] _think_ _that_ [they] deserve _anything_ less 
B|19| B: [Yeah .] I'd _like to_ see [the] death penalty _more_ _as_ _a_ deterrent _, I think_ _people_ [know] [that] nobody _, that_ [it] doesn't _, you know , it's_ _not_ _a_ deterrent _right_ _now_ _, because_ _it's_ _not_ _really_ effective . 
A|20| A: _You know_ _my_ husband's [always] _got_ [it] _on_ . 
B|21| B: _That's_ _one of_ _those_ _things_ [I] [got] famous _for_ [in] _college_ . People _would_ _come_ [and] _say_ _could_ _would_ [you] _come_ _over_ [and] _make_ lasagna _for_ _me_ 
A|22| A: [But] [I always] _feel like _I_ would_ _never_ _put_ _my_ parents [in] _either_ [and I] wonder _, I'm_ [going to be] [the] _only_ sibling [that] isn't [going _to] have_ _children_ _so_ _if_ _my_ parents [do] _need to_ _live_ _with_ someone _, it_ _will_ _probably_ [be] _with_ [me] [because] [all] _my_ brothers [and] sisters _will_ [be] having teenagers _around _and_ everything_ [to] care [for] . _You know ,_ 
B|23| B: _Yeah [,_ it] depends . Sure _. Uh _,_ so_ _you don't_ [, uh ,] [if] [you] _had_ [the] choice [would] [you] wear _a_ tie _or_ _not_ ? 
A|24| A: _And_ _then_ [even] _my_ eleven year old boy loves [to] _listen_ [to] [it] . 
B|25| B: _Right ._ 
A|26| A: [and] _in the_ summertime [we] _get_ [the] prettiest yellow flowers . 
B|27| B: It's _just_ too distracting _right_ _now_ [with] these _little_ _ones_ [in] _our_ lives _, so_ maybe _when_ [I] [get] older I'll _find_ [, uh ,] _some_ joy [in] [that] 
A|28| A: [That's] sweet [, _I] _have_ the_ _two_ _, the_ other _two_ cats _I have_ [are] outdoor cats . 
B|29| B: [Well [,] uh [,] uh ,] smoking [and] [all] [that] stuff ? 
A|30| A: _and _,_ and we_ [really] _don't _have_ any_ [that] _don't have the_ Social Security _and everything_ [really] isn't _that much for_ elderly [people] [to] _live_ _on_ . 
B|31| B: _and they_ _had_ [all] kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and everything] _, you know , all_ _out _in_ this_ [, _in] the [,_ _in] this_ schoolyard _there _._ So_ [we] _just_ _said_ , hey , let's stop [and] [and] [the] _kids_ [got] [to] _go_ [around _and] , you know ,_ see pigs [and] animals [and] _things_ _like _that_ ,_ 
A|32| A: _Um_ _, [and_ _,] um _,_ um [,_ you know , [it's] , it's] [just] nice [that] cats [, you know ,] cats _, [yeah_ [,] [you] _don't] have_ [to] _let_ [them] outside [, you know , all] cats [are] indoor cats , 
B|33| B: _Uh-huh . Yeah ,_ _ready_ [to] _go_ another _twelve_ hours _. Yeah _,_ yeah ._ 
A|34| A: [Yeah .] 
B|35| B: [So ,] social changes aren't [that much for] [me] [either] . 
A|36| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [pretty] [out] [there .] What _, well ,_ 
B|37| B: Oh , exactly . Each _individual_ jury [really] doesn't [have any] perception [of] _what_ [, um [,] the] _going [,_ you know ,] [if] [you] [will] [the] _going [,_ uh ,] award _should_ [be] _for a_ certain type [of] case [, you know ,] _within_ _some_ _kind of_ range . 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [And] 
A|40| A: [And] _have a_ [good] afternoon . 
B|41| B: _and I , I_ told _him ,_ [listen] [you] _could_ [have] _had_ _a lot of_ _money_ [if] [you] [would] [have] [only] _had_ [two] _kids_ . 
A|42| A: [and] [it] takes _about_ four [to] five cans [to] fill [up] [a] air conditioning unit [in] [a] car _, [and I_ , I] _thought_ _about_ [that _,] and_ _my_ husband [even] _was_ [kind of] woozy after [that] [because] [I'm sure] _he_ breathed [it] 
B|43| B: [That's] _right_ We're against [it] [That's] _right_ . 
A|44| A: [Yeah] 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: Look professional 
B|47| B: _It_ _was , uh _,_ that_ _was the_ _one_ [that] [was] used [so] [much] [in the] campaign . In [the] [in the] presidential race _. Uh ,_ may [, it] may _not_ [have] _been_ Maryland . _It_ may [have] _been_ Massachusetts [, [I] don't] remember . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] They _live_ lean [for] [one] [thing] [and they] tithe [and they] [it] puts [a] whole [in] your [money] bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor God [with] [this] portion [and] [so] [they] [, I think] [that] helps [a lot] _. [I_ think] [that's] [the] key [, in] _he_ , [like] _his_ sales last year _he_ [just] works [a] normal job . He _probably_ has an income [of] thirty-five thousand _, but_ last year _he_ made [that] [got] [him] [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed [him] [to] _pay_ cash [for a] full size van . He loves God [, _I] mean [,_ _it] [was_ the] biggest [thing] [that] [any] [one] [in this] company [had] ever done , 
B|49| B: [yeah [,] that's] important [I would] _say_ . 
A|50| A: [And] [so] [when] [that] [thing] came [up] [in] Wal-Mart parking [lot] [, we] _thought_ , oh , [this] _is_ great . [And] [we] started taking [them] [up [there] .] [And] _then [,_ all] [the] sudden [, it] disappeared [, you _know] I_ didn't _know ._ [And] we're [going ,] oh _, no_ , [there] goes [our] recycling place . 
B|51| B: [I] couldn't [either] . 
A|52| A: [So [,] that's] [it] [that's] _okay_ _, my [,_ that] phone _is_ ringing [to] an empty desk [and] she's _on_ vacation , 
B|53| B: [I] [never] felt spoiled . In fact [I always] [thought] [my] toys _were_ destroyed 
A|54| A: _We_ [don't] [even] [have any] concrete [or] asphalt . 
B|55| B: _he said_ [his] . 
A|56| A: [and] especially [, uh [,] in] Wisconsin [and] Michigan [they] _say _,_ no_ , buying [of] [our] fish . 
B|57| B: [So] _you [have_ a] [probably] [a] _more_ pitched roof _than_ [is] typical [around] here . 
A|58| A: _and [, uh_ ,] they'll [find] _something_ [like _that] _and_ just_ absolutely sit glued [to] _it _,_ I [,_ you know [,] I] keep _telling_ [them] [it's] [the] same mentality [you know _,] and_ something's wrong _, _and_ [, uh_ _,] but_ [, uh _,] and we_ very seldom watch television _on_ [a] Friday night [or] Saturday night [, because] we're [not] [home] 
B|59| B: [Yeah _,] _I , I_ ,_ _New_ York does [not] 
A|60| A: Like [what] ? 
B|61| B: _and then_ [you] _go_ _over_ [and] release [it] _and then_ [it] _just [,_ it] [just] drops [, you [know] .] 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh] [, [yeah] [,] you] still [have] [to do] [it] _. I , I ,_ 
B|63| B: Especially _when _you_ [have_ a] family , [with] [children] [, and] [you] [are] [always] [going _to] the_ doctor [for] , 
A|64| A: No , we're [not] [I don't] [think] _. [I_ think] [, that's] [more] realistic [than] making [them] [go] [in the] Peace Corps . 
B|65| B: [But] [it was] _good [._ [I] mean] [it _was] _,_ it ,_ at [that] _time_ [there] _were_ [two] [children] [and they] _were_ [in] special programs [and] _each_ [one] _was a little_ _over_ [two] hundred [a] week _and [then_ [,] in] addition [, I] paid _a little bit_ extra _. But_ [the] _kids_ _were_ , 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: Yes . 
A|68| A: [and then] [we] _put_ [that] _on the_ computer [and then] [we] took _about_ _three_ months _and [, uh_ [,] and] adjusted , where [we] [could] [come] _down_ [and] where [we] didn't _want to_ [come] _down_ , 
B|69| B: [Yeah [,] well [,] _my ,] my_ oldest [is] [only] nine . 
A|70| A: [And] [as] [I] look [out] [the] window [of] [my] trailer [, I] can envision [all] [the] insulation [that's] [going] [up] today 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [Well ,] anyway , 
A|74| A: [And] [it was] [just [,] uh ,] amazing [to] [me] [, and] [of] course [they] made [a] big deal [out] _of the [,_ the] few [that] [got] [out] [and] turned [around and] committed [a] crime [within] five days [of] getting [out] [, and] being rearrested an . 
B|75| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: _I mean [,_ well [,] they are] [the] [people] whose strings [are] pulled [and] by _I guess_ powerful 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: China [was [a little] bit] [more] [, uh ,] _of a_ challenge [. But [,] it [,] it] wasn't _more of a_ challenge [in] [a] sense _because I_ hired [a] guide [all] [the] [time] , 
B|79| B: [I'm] surprised . My dad worked [for] Arby's [for] several _years_ . 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: Is [it] [a] [two] eighty-six [or] [three] eighty-six base machine ? 
A|82| A: Huh . 
B|83| B: Wow . 
A|84| A: [Uh-huh . Yeah [,] you] saw , statistics [that] lawyers [and] doctors [make] [the] most [money] [in the] long run . 
B|85| B: [Yeah .] 
A|86| A: Huh . 
B|87| B: I'll [let] [you] lead [out] . 
A|88| A: [my] husband likes Pepsi [and] [those] cans [are] steel instead [of] aluminum [, so] [we] can't , can't ever recycle [them] [. [I] think] [it's a] [good] reason [to] quit buying [it] . 
B|89| B: [I] used _to [,_ uh ,] [live] [in the] Ozarks [and , uh] liked [to] [go] [up there] [and just] _take_ [a] backpack [and] strike [out] into _the woods_ . 
A|90| A: _Um_ , hobbies [, I] [like] , messing [around] [in] your house building [things] [, [and] , you know ,] putting cabinets _up [,_ [and] [,] those] [kind of] [things] [, um ,] 
B|91| B: Oh , [okay] . 
A|92| A: Recently graduated from high _school_ . Meaning [like] [, uh [,] you know ,] [three] [or] four [years] ago . [I'm] [a] senior [in , in , uh ,] [college] _now ._ 
B|93| B: [You know ,] [people] [just] [don't have] [that [and] [they] are] afraid [to] [go] [to] church [or] afraid [to] [go] simply [because] [they] [don't have the] clothes [to] wear . 
A|94| A: Okay . [I'm sure] [that] [I] [probably] [, uh ,] prescribe [to] different magazines [ones] [that] [you] [do] 
B|95| B: _Right ._ There [for a] while [, that] [would] [, that] worked . We've _, uh , I_ [know [I] have] [, um ,] I'll stick [to] [uh _,] _to_ [the_ [,] you know ,] sometimes I'll stick [to] [a] certain party , depends [on [the] guy] . 
A|96| A: [So ,] [a lot of] [things] [that] [are] saying [that] they're _no_ longer [going to be] doing [for] next wars [that] [are] [coming] [up] [that] [they] did [for] [this] [one] [in] getting rid _of [a_ lot of] [things] [. So] [I don't [know] .] 
B|97| B: That [was] [my] daughter's Brownie leader _telling me_ [that] [there] [is] [a] meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting . 
A|98| A: [Yeah ,] an [, and] [my , my] [kids] , 
B|99| B: Bye video 
A|100| A: Okay [. Uh ,] [one _of] the_ [things] [they] talked _about_ [was , uh ,] did [we] , [what] _do we_ [think] _about_ [a] judge making [the] decision ? 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: Than [you] , [sure] . Than [it ,] [when you] [were] younger , uh-huh . 
B|103| B: [Well [,] [I] guess] [a lot [of] the _,] uh , something_ [that's] [kind of] [more of a] comedy _. We_ [do] [have] [, uh ,] cable [, and we] [have] premium stations [like] H B O [and] Showtime [and] such [, and [I] guess] [a lot of] _times_ [when] [I] first _turn_ [the] T V [on] _, I , I_ normally [go] [to] [those] [, [because] I] [pay] [for] [them] 
A|104| A: [Uh ,] very [good .] 
B|105| B: [Well [,] I'm] [in] graduate [school] [now [.] I _, I ,] I_ [kind of] [feel like I] wish [I] [could] [have] gone back [to] undergraduate [now] 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh] [, yeah .] 
B|107| B: [Yeah .] There's , there's [a] race [in] Australia [with] solar powered cars . 
A|108| A: [it] seems [like] , [really] [a] rough [time] 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right [.] I] agree [with] [that [,] I] agree [with] [that] [. But] [I] believe [that [,] uh ,] an [individual] [should] [really] learn how [to [,] to] learn 
B|111| B: [Right [.] Yeah [,] my] backyard [is] [, uh ,] [is] sloping [so] [I] built [a] box [up [,] you know] [had] [to] build [the] [one] [, the] low side [up] . 
A|112| A: _Um_ , September [really] [was [,] I'm] [not] [sure] _about_ October [. [I] think] [for] _about_ [twelve] months through September [the [,] the] average temperature has [been] higher [than] normal [each] month . _Um_ , lots [of] ninety degree days during [the] summer . 
B|113| B: [Well ,] [do we] ? 
A|114| A: [Yeah .] 
B|115| B: [to] her Go [on] [and] talk [to] Daddy [about] [it] Tell Daddy [I] unplugged [it] [for] [you] [. But] [you don't] [need to] drag [it] [down] [the] hall 
A|116| A: [Well [,] you] [ready] [for] [New] Year's Eve ? 
B|117| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|118| A: [right] , [just] [to] [get] [you] by five [years] [and then] you'll throw [it] away rather [than] [have] [it] fixed 
B|119| B: [because] [if] [that's] [what] , [if] [that's] [what] [the] punishment [is] [in] [that [,] in] [that] instance , [then] _you're_ [always] [going to] [say [,] you know ,] [not] _you're_ _, you're_ [not] [going to] [want [to] have] [him] [have] [that] [uh [,] that] punishment _. So ,_ 
A|120| A: [You know [,] uh , something] light [and] easy . If [it was] [pretty] informal [about] _anything_ . 
B|121| B: sometimes [they] [do] [put] [them] [in , uh ,] fairly low paying situations . 
A|122| A: [and [, uh] , I] [like] [those] [. We] very seldom watch [any] [, uh ,] Public Television , Channel Thirteen . Do [you] watch [it] [much] ? 
B|123| B: [Yeah] [and ,] 
A|124| A: No [, the] [times] I've [been] [out] deer hunting [, I , I] can [go] [out [in] [the] woods] unarmed [and] deer [will] [be] tripping [over] [me] [and] vice versa . 
B|125| B: [Well [,] I , I] [really] choose restaurants [more] [for] [the] quality [of] food [than] [anything] else . 
A|126| A: What [do] [you] [like to] watch [on] television ? 
B|127| B: [Yeah .] 
A|128| A: [Well [,] um [,] I] seem [to] [always] [be] [in the [,] the] next [to the] last generation [of] word processing software . When everyone [was] [in] Samna [I] [was] still [in] P F M [, and] [now] [that] [I] finally become proficient [in] Samna everybody's [going to] WordPerfect [. So [,] I] can [never] quite stay current [with] [that] . 
B|129| B: [Um] . 
A|130| A: [It] [kind of] traveled [around] travel . 
B|131| B: [Uh-huh .] Oh [, no] . 
A|132| A: [Yeah [.] Yeah] [my] husband [was] complaining [the] other day [because] [he said] every [time] [I] [turn] [around] [you're] [telling me] [some] new rule [about] recycling [like] yesterday [I] [was] tell [him [,] [you] have] [to [,] you're] supposed [to] squeeze [the] plastic jugs before [you] [take] [them] [up [there] .] 
B|133| B: [And] [I don't know] [that's] true [or] [not] [. [I] mean [,] I] [just] heard [it] [in] passing [, but] [so] [what] does [that ,]
