A|0| A: Especially _if_ _your_ spouse _will_ _get in_ _there_ _with_ _you_ _and_ _get_ dirty _, yeah_ . 
B|1| B: _I think_ _that's_ _one_ reason _we have_ problems [in] schools _, uh _,_ and_ _some_ _of them_ _are_ _our_ problems _, but_ _a lot of_ _it's_ _because_ _everything_ society wants _, we_ _are_ supposed _to do_ . 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|4| A: [I] imagine . 
B|5| B: _Well_ _we _had_ a_ German Shepherd [and] he _had_ dysplasia 
A|6| A: It _really_ _is _,_ I mean_ _we're_ , _we're_ _in a_ leased _town_ _home_ [, _and] it's_ [, uh _,] you're_ _probably_ , _your_ teeth _will_ _probably_ fall _out_ figuratively speaking _, it's_ nine hundred [a] month . 
B|7| B: _my_ boss _thinks_ _I'm_ absolutely crazy _. And_ _then_ _we _had_ a_ baby [and it's] _like_ _, all_ _right_ _who_ comes first _the_ cat _or_ _the_ baby . 
A|8| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|9| B: _Oh ,_ wow . 
A|10| A: _Yes ._ 
B|11| B: _Yeah ._ _So_ _I think it_ _would_ _be_ [a] _good_ thing though _, to_ encourage _other_ _people who_ _aren't_ _even_ aware _that they_ _can_ _do_ such [a] thing . _to_ [get] _out there_ _and do_ _so_ . 
A|12| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: _Yeah _,_ yes ._ _So_ _where_ _have_ [you] _been_ ? 
A|14| A: [Yeah _,] _I_ _know ,_ and_ [that's] _, you know _,_ like I_ [can] _look_ outside [right] now [and] _look_ _into the_ next unit . 
B|15| B: _Oh _,_ that sounds_ _good ._ 
A|16| A: _Uh ._ Explained , *listen; could [be] br 
B|17| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _Well _,_ it's_ _very_ true . 
B|19| B: _I had a_ cat _, I've_ _had_ _several_ _cats ._ My pet [, uh ,] _was_ hit by [a] car _New_ Year's Eve _, but , uh ,_ 
A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: _Oh _,_ _I'm_ not_ surprised . 
A|22| A: _Oh , yes _,_ yes [,_ yes .] 
B|23| B: Surely . 
A|24| A: _That's_ _real_ nice . 
B|25| B: _So_ he hasn't [really] gotten [into] _, um _,_ that_ yet . _They_ _have_ _choir_ _that they_ _go _to_ [,_ you know ,] music class _that they_ _go to_ 
A|26| A: [and] [everything] _has_ _to be_ _an_ immediate reward _and it_ _has_ _to be_ fun . 
B|27| B: _and they_ _are_ _just_ _a lot_ _more_ mature , _than_ [the] average _student_ 
A|28| A: _Well _, _I_ _,_ I_ think_ [we] _kind of_ [are] along _the same_ lines . 
B|29| B: [Well _,] she_ _does_ _not_ _have _it_ _,_ but _,_ she_ [is] [like] , _on the_ verge _of it_ _or ,_ _something_ . 
A|30| A: _Uh _._ Yeah_ _I _,_ that was_ [really] , _really good _,_ the_ movie [was] nothing compared _to the_ book . 
B|31| B: [I think] maybe [you] [look] _at [,_ uh [,] the] age _of the_ _person_ _and their_ station [in] _life _and_ _, _and_ ,_ uh _,_ how_ _much_ longer _they_ _have_ _of work_ _years_ _that _they_ would_ _have to_ _put_ _up_ [, you know _,] _with_ , with_ _that _._ I mean_ maybe [you] _don't_ award [an] eighty-five _year_ old _guy_ [the same] thing [that] [you] _would_ award [a] twenty-one _year_ old . 
A|32| A: Are [you] _going_ [up] toward [, uh [,] uh [,] I'm] trying [to] [think] [of the] name [of] [that] _town_ [that] starts [with] [an] M , Bradford , _no_ [that's] _too_ _far_ north . 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [Oh ,] [really] _, that's great _._ Uh _,_ my_ daughter talked _to a_ [student] _. Uh _,_ in_ general most [of them] [, uh ,] [people] _doing_ _this_ [are] T [I] [but] [I] guess customers _too ,_ huh ? 
B|35| B: Physics . 
A|36| A: _I would_ love [that .] 
B|37| B: [Yeah ,] 
A|38| A: [Well [,] _I've] never_ [had] catfish _either_ _in a_ restaurant [because] [I'm] _from_ [the] north _and _that_ was_ [a] _no_ _no_ . 
B|39| B: [I _think] _that_ , uh [,_ my] own interest _in , in_ development , human development leads _me_ [to] _believe that_ [that's] [a] [good] sign [and _that] , uh ,_ private enterprise _is the_ _way_ [to] _go_ [and that] [it] [will] lead [to a] fundamental change _in the_ _way_ [we] learn . 
A|40| A: [but] [then] [just] another different set [of] [people] come [in [,] and] most [of the] _people are_ transients _from_ [out] , outside [of the] state . 
B|41| B: _You_ _have_ _more of_ [a] choice [, you're] _not_ pressed upon _as_ bad . 
A|42| A: _Uh-huh , uh-huh ._ 
B|43| B: [Well _,] not_ _so_ _much_ personally [but] [my] _, um ,_ _husband_ [has] [an] aunt _who_ [has] _been_ _like a_ second mother [, I mean] always lived _in [the_ same] [town] [and] took care [of] him [and] such . _They_ live down [in] College Station _where_ , _his_ parents _do_ _too _._ And_ _they_ _put_ _her_ [in a] [home] last _year_ . 
A|44| A: The men _that are_ [out there] fixing power lines [are] tested [a lot] [and] [the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with , _with] the_ guys [that] fix [the] power lines [aren't] tested [as] [much] . 
B|45| B: What's _that ?_ 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [I] [a] _or ,_ _or_ foreign cars actually [. Uh ,] 
A|48| A: [I think] [so] [Well ,] [it] [was] _really good_ hearing _from_ [you] [and] [I] hope [you] [get] _back_ [into] camping again [, [and] _do] _a_ little_ [more [of] it] . 
B|49| B: Is _that _,_ is that_ [good] ? _You know _,_ I've seen_ [that] [so] many times , strawberries dipped [in] chocolate [but] [I've never] tried _it ,_ [are] _they_ [really good] ? 
A|50| A: Actually [, _to] tell you_ [the] truth _, I think_ [, uh ,] jury selection _is a_ [, uh ,] prime [, uh ,] discussion topic [in] terms [of] possible improvements [on] [, uh [,] uh ,] finding _of , uh ,_ guilt . 
B|51| B: We _don't_ regret paying taxes . We [do] _think _that_ , uh ,_ sometimes [, uh _,] _we_ have_ [a] reverse [of] [a] regressive tax , [a] progressive tax . 
A|52| A: _Okay_ [Uh [,] I] [just] currently quit [my] job _and _so_ I_ _really don't_ receive _any_ benefits [right] now 
B|53| B: Now , 
A|54| A: [Yeah .] 
B|55| B: [Yeah .] Unfortunately . 
A|56| A: [I think] [so] _too _,_ uh , _I_ know_ _the , the_ group _I was_ [in] [at] [the] _time_ _this_ [all] _came_ [up] _they [,_ uh ,] _were_ quite vocal _about it ,_ through electronic mail , boy _, they_ [just] [really] [, you know] let [them] [have it] _from_ [one] _end_ _to the_ [other] , vehemently 
B|57| B: [Yeah] 
A|58| A: _Most_ everybody [I've] [been] talking [to] [is] _from_ Texas [, but , uh ,] _we're_ [up] _here_ [in] western , northwestern part [of] Pennsylvania . 
B|59| B: _Yeah , it's_ usually beautiful [up] [there] _isn't it_ ? 
A|60| A: [Yeah _.] I think_ [it's] _a little_ harsh [to] _say_ [that _they] should_ [have to] _spend a_ [year] [or] two . 
B|61| B: Bye-bye . 
A|62| A: _Oh , yes [,_ but] [we] try [, you know [,] I] try [, my] [husband] also , _we're_ involved [in] [everything] [our] kids [does] 
B|63| B: _And_ [probably] [then] _some_ I'll [spend _a] lot of_ [time] praying over [it] before [I] give [it] [up] . 
A|64| A: [Uh [,] in] parts [. I mean] [you] couldn't [, you] [really] couldn't use [it] _for a_ room . 
B|65| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: _Yes ._ _Yes_ [, yes [.] I] _just [,_ I] love [that [,] all] those [, that] two hours 
B|67| B: _and they_ [do _a] lot _of_ things_ [to] themselves [that [,] _that] we_ [really _don't] want_ [our] young [people] [to be] [doing] 
A|68| A: [Yeah ,] [isn't it] funny . 
B|69| B: [Yeah .] See [I'm] unfamiliar [with] [that] [because] _I don't , I_ [never] see [that] [end] [of the] business . 
A|70| A: [Well] [I] guess [that] [will] [be] [it] [then] [and ,] 
B|71| B: Hey , listen , [if] _I had_ [my] _way_ [, I] wouldn't _pay_ [my] taxes . Not _with the _,_ not_ [with] _some_ [of the] _things that_ [I] hear [that] [our] tax money [is] [going] [for] _some_ ludicrous _things_ . 
A|72| A: Huh . 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: Gosh . 
B|75| B: _after_ [that ,] [if] [you] asked _me_ [that] [I] wouldn't [have] [been] able [to tell you] [if] [that was] football [or] baseball . 
A|76| A: [Yeah _,] [I think_ it] [was] [on] [a] Hard Copy [, she] [was] [a] _real_ attractive blond girl [, [in] , in] [her] freshman [year] [of] _college_ 
B|77| B: [Okay] _, _what_ kind of_ puppy [you] _got_ ? 
A|78| A: [Yeah _,] that's_ exactly [it [,] and] [that's] [what] _we're_ finding [, um ,] _here_ , [where] _we're_ [at [,] in] Minneapolis area [, is that] [people] [don't want] [to] carpool [that] [there] [are] inconveniences [to] [that ,] 
B|79| B: _Um [,_ you] [look] [at] [your] paycheck [and] _you go_ _, oh_ [, my] gosh [where] _did_ _it all_ _go_ _Um _,_ _what_ kind of _,_ _what_ kind of , uh ,_ well [have] [you] _pay_ _a lot of_ [in] [have] [you] [been] [out] _working_ [and] [then] gone [back] [to] _school_ [or] [are] [you] , _did_ _you go_ directly [from] high _school_ [into] , [into] [college] ? 
A|80| A: [And] [how] [they would] expect [, how] [they would] hope , 
B|81| B: [Well [,] that's] _good _._ That's_ [great .] 
A|82| A: That [is] _when_ [she] [did] _, I think_ . 
B|83| B: For _, for_ honest mistakes [where] they've _done_ _something_ _and , and_ _something_ happens . One [of] _their_ employees causes damage [or] _something_ . Sure _. That's_ [what] [they] _buy_ insurance [for] . 
A|84| A: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
B|85| B: Bye . 
A|86| A: Remember [that ?] 
B|87| B: _And [,_ that was] [the] sort [of] thing [that] [I would] [say] _is the_ best MUMBLEx [and] _not_ news 
A|88| A: _Uh-huh ,_ you'd [just] [do] [it] . 
B|89| B: [Uh .] 
A|90| A: [Oh] dear . [Oh] [but] [that's] nice [, you know [,] I mean] [the] peach tree _is , _is_ a_ start [and ,] 
B|91| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: _It's_ _just _,_ so_ [, it's] [a lot [of] _work] _,_ too_ 
B|93| B: Always [, yes] ma'am . 
A|94| A: Go ahead . 
B|95| B: [Yeah [,] [they] ,] down [here] [they [,] they] stopped [for] awhile [or] [they] [really] made [it] _hard to_ hunt [them] . 
A|96| A: [the] [I think] [the [,] I] guess [the] _only_ _real_ [, um ,] benefit [I] guess [you] could [say] [working] [, for] [me] [working] [here] _, besides_ [I mean] [I'm] learning [and] stuff [because] [, I'm] [at [,] you know [,] in] [school] . 
B|97| B: [Yeah _.] Right ._ 
A|98| A: _Yes ._ If [you] [like] wildlife [, it's] [a] fabulous vacation . 
B|99| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: [Oh ,] _really ._ 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [I don't] [believe _that] we're_ , 
B|103| B: Nobody [came] near [it] [when] he [was] [there] . 
A|104| A: If [you] [had] [to do] [something] [like] [that ,] _day_ [after] _day_ . 
B|105| B: Strange . 
A|106| A: _and we_ start [out] [with] EVENING SHADE [and] MAJOR DAD , 
B|107| B: [Oh , yes ,] [or] [they [,] I] agree [with the] freedom [of the] press _, you know , and_ [all] [the] amendments [, but] sometimes [it's] [for] [the] public's own [good] _that _we_ don't_ hear _things_ . 
A|108| A: [That's] _right ._ 
B|109| B: [Oh ,] absolutely . [that's] [right .] 
A|110| A: [That's] [right .] When [we had] [our] pool [done] [I had] [them] [to] leave [some] extra loam [, you know [,] for] [my] garden _so [I_ had] [, [I] had [a] lot of] loam [out there] [to] start [with] [I] [just] turned [it all] [up] [and] mixed [it all] [up] together [with ,] 
B|111| B: _Right [._ [I] [, I] _,] yeah [,_ I] spent [a] summer [in] Tyler [so [I] know ,] [just] east [of] Dallas [there] . 
A|112| A: Huh . 
B|113| B: [Yeah .] 
A|114| A: [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [I know [,] I] [really] [will] [do] [that] [the] next [time] [, I] [buy] [it] [too .] 
B|117| B: Take [a] twenty-two [and] _go_ [out] . 
A|118| A: [Yeah .] 
B|119| B: _Right ._ 
A|120| A: [They] [, they] fear _being_ [a] burden [to [,] to] _family_ members . 
B|121| B: _And [, uh [,_ I] _think] [that_ we're] paying [too] [much] [because] [I _don't] have_ [any] children . 
A|122| A: _How_ [would] [, how] [is the] situation [in] [there] [in] terms [of] crime [and , and] [things that] [would] , 
B|123| B: [I don't] [think] necessarily [that ,] [things] [are] [being] made better _uh , you know ,_ 
A|124| A: [And , uh ,] 
B|125| B: [but ,] 
A|126| A: _But_ _very_ true [to] [life] [, I mean] [, I've seen] [our] _family_ [in] [several] [of] those situations 
B|127| B: [Yeah _,] we_ _, _we_ have_ [, that] [is [,] uh ,] [as] [a] matter [of] fact [they] update [it] once _a week_ [with] [a] special section _, we_ _, and we_ _pay_ [it] sort [of] glancing nod . We [, uh ,] [have] [a] [very] [good] friend _who_ [is [,] uh ,] tapped [into _the] city_ planning structure [. Uh ,] [our] developer architect friend [and ,] 
A|128| A: [That's] [really] stupid . 
B|129| B: _yeah _,_ we_ used [to [,] that's] [one] [of [the] [,] um ,] entrances [to the] periphery [to] [get in] [and] [out] _of the city_ . 
A|130| A: [You know ,] [even] [if] _they're in_ [good] health [it's] incredible . 
B|131| B: [Yeah _,] that sounds_ _like a_ [good] idea . My [only] concern [is] [what] happens _when you_ turn [things] over [to the] government _, I don't_ [know] 
A|132| A: [Yeah .] 
B|133| B: [Yeah .] [Well [, I] think] [one] [of [the] , the] best ways [to] eliminate [, uh ,] [or] help [the] recycling problem [is] [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
A|134| A: [Uh ,] premeditated _murder_ . Crimes [of] [that] nature [, I think] _should_ definitely , 
B|135| B: [Yes .] _So_ [would] [I] . 
A|136| A: [Um [,] we] [got] two [cats .] 
B|137| B: [Uh ,] [at] [this] point . 
A|138| A: What [, what] type [of] area [is [that] ,] 
B|139| B: [And] she's [so] easy [going] [and so] sociable , 
A|140| A: [Oh [,] yeah] [. That's] [good .] Actually , 
B|141| B: [but] _it's _kind of_ , uh [,_ all] [the] industry [has] gone south , 
A|142| A: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
B|143| B: [I think it] [would] [be] [really .] [really] [great .] 
A|144| A: [You know ,] [it] [was] [, and [,] you know [, [and] ,] [and] [they] [,] and we] didn't [have] power _for [a_ week] [and] [there] [are] still [people who] [don't have] power . 
B|145| B: Although they've [got] [, uh ,] Meals On Wheels , Which [I] _understand_ [is a] [really good [,] you know ,] _way_ [to] handle [that] [so] [that] _at least_ [they] eat . 
A|146| A: [And] [she] [thinks] [, yeah ,] twenty-five percent . It , [it] [was] [a] small [school] 
B|147| B: [But] [, like I] said , [if] , [if] someone [is , is] [just] pathologically [going] [to] [murder] [people] [no] matter [what] [then] [I think] [they should] [be] eliminated [from] society . 
A|148| A: [Right .] 
B|149| B: [Um _,] I don't_ [know] [who] else [I've] ever [. That's] [about it _,] I was_ always [a] Viking fan [. I think] [I was] [into the] Cardinals [for [a] little] bit [and ,] 
A|150| A: Ha-ha [Well [, I] was] [kind of] hoping [with [,] you know ,] [do] [you] [work] [for] T [I] ? 
B|151| B: [Well [,] we] [like] Arby's . As [far] [as] , fast food goes . 
A|152| A: [Yeah , [it's] kind of] [like] [in] Louisiana [where] [that , uh ,] [guy] [that's] [like a] Ku Klux Klan member [something] [got] elected . 
B|153| B: [but , uh [,] we] feel [real] fortunate [and _we] were_ able [to [,] uh ,] [just [,] uh ,] choose _in the_ marketplace _. I don't_ [know] [what] [it's] [like] _around_ [, uh ,] Hattiesburg . 
A|154| A: [Well ,] 
B|155| B: [Um] . Paper [just] seems [so] innocuous . 
A|156| A: [Oh _,] you are_ ? East [or] west [, I'm] [from] Pittsburgh . *listen 
B|157| B: [It's] [, it's] amazing [, they] [either] [have] [one] [or] none . 
A|158| A: [But] [I] find [that] [when you] [do] [that [,] you] [do] [more] chatting [than] [you] [do] exercise 
B|159| B: [but] [it's] comfort [. Uh _,] there's_ [a lot of] features [on] [there] [that are] desirable [if] [you're] [going] _to pay_ [that] [kind of] money [for a] car [. Uh ,] 
A|160| A: [So] [his] solution [was] [to] burn plastic . Collect [it] [and] burn [it] . 
B|161| B: Hey , 
A|162| A: No kids , 
B|163| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|164| A: [Oh [,] yeah] ? 
B|165| B: [Oh [,] that's great .] 
A|166| A: [and] _they're_ [being] [put] [in the] middle [of the city] 
B|167| B: Absolutely . 
A|168| A: [Right _.] Right ,_ [probably] [more [of] them] _then the_ [other] [way] [around] Interesting [. [I don't] [, [I] don't] [,] not] sure _I , _I'm_ in_ Washington , D C [or] [at least] [very] close [to] [it] . [I'm not] sure [what kind of , uh ,] capital punishment [we have] [here] . 
B|169| B: [Yeah . Yeah .] 
A|170| A: [Oh [,] yeah] [. Right .] 
B|171| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|172| A: [Well] _whatever_ , [this] [is] [one] aspect [of it] . 
B|173| B: [That's] [a] [good] idea . 
A|174| A: _Uh-huh , uh-huh [._ And] [what] kinds [of things] [do] [you] use [it] [for] [when you] [when [you] [go] to] [their] houses [to] [them] ? 
B|175| B: [Oh [,] uh-huh .] 
A|176| A: [Well ,] [do] [you] [think [that] we] [do] [it] [because] [we] [want] _it to_ deter crime [or [,] it's] [not] [because] [we [don't] want] [to pay] [for] inmates [to] stay [in] prison ? 
B|177| B: [Uh-huh , uh-huh .] [How] [about] [you] ? 
A|178| A: [Well [,] that sounds] interesting [. I] bet he's enjoyed having [it] [that] [way] 
B|179| B: [it's] [been] denied fortunately [but ,] 
A|180| A: [Yeah .] 
B|181| B: [Yeah .] 
A|182| A: Anyway [, it's] [a] tough question . 
B|183| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|184| A: [I [,] and] [I think] [if] [a] [person] [is] guilty [of] taking someone's [life and] [like] [you] [say] [, it's] [, it's] [, there's] [no] doubt whatsoever . Like drunk drivers [that] kill [people] [and , [uh ,] you know [,] all] 
B|185| B: [Yeah [,] you] [too [,] you] [too .] 
A|186| A: [um [,] it's] [really] [, I mean] [, [and ,] [and] it's] [hard to] sell [the] properties . People [from] J C Penney's [from] [New] York , [came] [here] [about] [a] couple [of] [years] ago . 
B|187| B: [Well [,] not] necessarily 
A|188| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|189| B: [Most] [people are] , [are] , retired [or ,] [or ,] [or [,] you know ,] [they're] , [they're _in] their_ forties [or ,] [or] [whatever] . [So] [and] [I'm in] [my] twenties [, [so] [I] , I'm] [, I'm] [out] [more] [than] [they] [are] [, but] [they're] [at] [home] [at] night , 
A|190| A: [Yeah .] 
B|191| B: [And] [to] [go to] [work [,] you are] worried _about your_ child [, besides] which [you] [have to] [get] [up] earlier [to] take [the] child [to] [day] care .
