A|2| A: _Yeah _,_ they_ _get out_ _in_ _three_ _years_ _on_ probation , 
B|3| B: Daddy , Daddy came home _and_ found _her_ playing _with_ [the] telephone _that_ _I_ _had_ unplugged 
A|4| A: [I] _just_ _think_ [that] everybody ought _to do_ _it_ . 
B|5| B: _so_ . 
A|6| A: _You_ _do_ , _like_ Arby's ? See _I don't_ _like_ Arby's . 
B|7| B: _Uh-huh ._ Yep , _we_ tried [to] convince _my_ grandfather [to] live _with_ us _at_ several points during [the] _last_ few [years] _of_ _his_ life _, but_ _he_ _was_ essentially _too_ proud _and_ _too_ independent _so_ [that] _even_ though _his_ heart _was_ _getting_ incredibly weak _and_ _his_ knees _were_ _going_ bad _he_ lived [in] _his_ own house as long as _he_ _could_ 
A|8| A: She looks gorgeous _, no_ she's gorgeous [and] she _just_ liked having kids [and] she's thin _and , I_ mean , four _or_ _more_ children _are_ thin , 
B|9| B: _I think_ _so_ . [Yeah ,] seven twenty-five . 
A|10| A: Just _because_ _there's_ _a_ friend _up_ _there_ , not _because_ _there's_ _much_ else 
B|11| B: _but_ _they _,_ they're_ already _, uh _,_ have_ [three] strikes _against_ _them_ _when_ _they're_ [out] _there ._

B|17| B: _And_ maybe _rather_ _than_ _just ,_ require [somebody] [to] join [like] _the Peace Corps_ [for] _a year_ maybe _like _,_ um ,_ during _college [,_ you know ,] maybe [have] _some_ _kind _of_ course_ where they'd _be_ required [to do] _some_ _kind of_ community service type work _, and_ help _people_ [in] [that] _area_ [or] _people_ _in the_ United States . 
A|18| A: _I don't_ let [that] worry _me_ _. And_ [I] _get_ [the] milk lukewarm _and then_ [I] pour about _a half_ [a] cup [of] cornstarch [in] _it_ [and] _I have_ _this_ _thing_ _it's_ called [the] slender blender _, it_ _, it_ makes [the] [, uh _,] it_ makes [, uh ,] [a] whip topping [out] [of] milk _if_ [you] _get_ [the] milk cold enough . It's [, uh _,] I _don't_ [know_ [,] they're] called moo goo leaves [or] _something_ [they're] 
B|19| B: _Well ,_ anytime [they] send [me] [a] return envelope [I] put _all_ [that] stuff back _in the_ envelope plus _the other_ stuff [that] _I [,_ you know ,] happen [to] gather [up] . 
A|20| A: Okay , _so ,_ _what_ _are_ , _what_ _are_ _your_ views _on_ capital punishment ? 
B|21| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|22| A: It's not unique ,

A|26| A: [Yeah .] 
B|27| B: [And] over [half] [of] [it] _has_ _been_ drug related . 
A|28| A: I'd [rather] see [it] [a] _little_ bit harder [and] _have a_ _little_ bit _more_ evidence [, uh ,] [to] convict [somebody] 
B|29| B: _but_ _I was_ very young [so] [I don't] _remember_ [that] [and , _I] was_ [three] _when_ [we] moved back _here_ . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [Yes .]

A|34| A: [Yeah .] We [do] _too ._ [I think] _a lot of_ [people] agree [the] same . 
B|35| B: _Really_ _was_ . 
A|36| A: _Well , they_ say [, [I] think] [I [,] um [,] have] read recently _that [,_ uh _,] the_ Bush Administration [has] increased [the] funding [for] [the Peace Corps] . 
B|37| B: No . The only [thing] [that] [I [,] I] visited [that [,] you know ,] _is_ quite [a] tourist spot _is_ Cancun , Mexico . 
A|38| A: [and [,] uh _,] I _have_ a_ four _year old_ who , who [has] _started_ [to] play [the] _piano_ _. He_ [does] [that [,] uh ,] musically , listens _and then_ [he] _can_ play , which [is] [kind of] [interesting] . 
B|39| B: My _husband_ [got] _his_ big garage [. He] _we have a_ [three] car garage _, that_ [he] _has a_ big work _area_ [in] 
A|40| A: Uh , _probably_ . Uh , actually spring semester [a year] from now he's _going to_ _have to_ [be] [in] child care [uh ,] _five_ days [a] week [more] [than] likely . Uh , depending _on_ how [my] class schedule runs 
B|41| B: Probably [so ,] 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [And they] say [it's] _going to_ [last] about two [to] [three] weeks [. And] [this] guy [in] front [of] [me] said [, I] can't believe [I was] summonsed . [I was] _an_ investigator [and] [I was] tailing [the] woman [that] [was] killed _. Well ,_ [then] _I [have_ a] friend [at] school [that] [has a] boyfriend that's [a] lawyer [and] [he] said [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] Plano [had] hired four guys [to] kill [her] [husband] [and] [the] _one_ that's accused [was] [the] _one_ [that] actually _did_ [it] [. And] she [has] since taken off [with] another lawyer who [had] [been] [, uh ,] [getting] cocaine from [his] client _and then_ selling [it] [, and] [he] [had] skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited him [and] he's _going to_ testify [for] [the] State [against] [her] [so] he'll [have] [his] sentence reduced . 
B|45| B: My neighbor across [the] street [has] [one] [. He] _always_ uses [it] [to] dethatch [his] lawn , 
A|46| A: Have [you] [, have] [you] done [this] repetitively , [or] [just] once ? 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [I] [know] [that] [it's] not settled [but] , [there] _are_ [other] areas [that] [we] [could] focus [our] attention _on_ . 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh] , golly [I] [know .] 
B|51| B: _So_ , who's [your] [, uh ,] favorite team ? 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [Well , they] [started] [out] _really_ bad [, they] went [like] [one] [and] six _, and _then_ they_ won [five] [or] six [in] [a] row . 
A|54| A: _Oh ,_ okay , yeah [, I] [got] [my] brother [and] [my] whole family [there .] I'm , I'm talking [to] [you] from Dallas [right] now . 
B|55| B: [Yeah] 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [Yeah .] 
A|58| A: Thirty , [or] thirty-two [for] [really] good tickets . See [, [they] [,] they] sectioned [it] [out] [even] [more] . They used [to] _just have_ [like [,] uh ,] first [of all] [it] [was] [all] [one] price [. And [then] they] sectioned [it] _out to_ end zone [and then] _everything_ else [. And] now [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] , from [one] twenty yard line [to] [the other] [one] , [just] _on the_ lower levels [is] [the] highest price [, and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] same [area] [but] above _it on the_ upper level [, and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line [. And then] [they're] [some] sections [kind of] [in the] corner areas [, and then] [the] cheapest [of course] [is] _going to_ [be] [the] end _, the_ direct end zones . But [, um [,] they] [have] about four [or] [five] _different_ prices now [, that] [they're] structuring [it] [with] [, but] obviously yeah [, they're] [all] [going] [up] , [more] [or] less [is] _what_ [it's] _going [to_ do] . 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|60| A: [and] [the] parents [do] not let [the] teachers discipline [the] children [the] way [that] [they] need [to] [be] disciplined [right] now . 
B|61| B: [Oh ,] well [my] favorite , well [, [I] [,] I don't] [really] [have a] favorite [, [I] [,] I] [like] [everything] basically . Um [, I] guess [if] [I] [had] [to] pick [, it] would [be] [like] pop [, I] would [think] [, but] [I] [like] [everything] . _So_ , [it's] [kind of] hard [to] choose sometimes . 
A|62| A: Okay _, the_ [topic] [is] social changes [and] discuss social changes [in] America [and] how [they] relate , [or] how [they] differ today [than] [they] [were] ten , fifteen [or] _thirty_ [years] ago . 
B|63| B: [I] [really] [don't [know] .] It [just] seems [like] [I] _here_ [it on the] news [the] day [before] . 
A|64| A: [Oh [,] it] [was] , 
B|65| B: [I] float [so] [that] [I have] [no] benefits except higher _pay_ [for] doing [that .] 
A|66| A: [Yeah .]

B|73| B: They've [been] [here] [probably] [thirty] , forty [years] . 
A|74| A: [Oh ,] [really] ? [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: _So_ , 
A|76| A: [I] mean [we] used [to] [pay] , [pay] _fifty_ cents [an] hour [to] baby-sit . But mine _are_ twenty-two , twenty-three [and] twenty-seven [so] [you know [,] [that] ,] 
B|77| B: [You] [don't know] [what] happened [to] GABRIEL'S FIRE [then] ? 
A|78| A: Wow . Why [is] [that] ? Do [you know] ? [I] mean 
B|79| B: [I have] [some] 
A|80| A: [I] will [always] [remember] [, I] will tell [this] real quick story [when] [I] graduated from [college ,] [my] first job [years] ago [, uh ,] [thirty] [years] ago , twenty-nine [years] ago , [in] fact , [was] selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|81| B: [Yes .] Absolutely . 
A|82| A: [So] [it] [is] , yeah [, and] [it] must [be] rough [for] [you] [too] [to] see [your] grandmother .

A|84| A: Just hadn't heard _much_ about [them] lately . 
B|85| B: Um . 
A|86| A: [so ,] that's why [I] [do] [that .] 
B|87| B: [Yeah ,] [I've] [been] calling [a lot of] companies . There , [some] [of] [them] [are] interested [. Well ,] [at] least [for] [a year] [and] [a half] [I] [can] work , 
A|88| A: [Yeah ,] [Yeah .] 
B|89| B: [And] [we] [really] [don't] spend [on] anything [much] [of] [a] luxury [or] anything [at] [all] [, but] [it] seems [like] [there's] [, um ,] times [when] [we] [just [have] to] [get out] where we'll go [and] [like] [get] [a] baby-sitter [and] we'll go [and] we'll blow [, you know ,] [fifty] , sixty dollars [in] [one] night [going] [out to] [eat] , [going to] [a] show [or] doing [something] [, you [know] .]
