B|55| B: _Right ._ 
A|56| A: [um ,] [but] [he] had [actually] [was] able [to get] him over [that] . 
B|57| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|58| A: [Oh .] 
B|59| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|60| A: [and] [it was] [for] _us_ many years , [for] many years . 
B|61| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|62| A: [Well [,] actually] [, I] don't [think] [they're] [out] [of] line . Devil's advocate possibly , [but] [it] [, you] [are] trying [to] avoid paying taxes [and] [whether] [or] [not] [you] agree [with] [that] law , you're still circumventing [it] . _You_ [are] legal [in] , [in] [your] circumvention [of] [that] law . 
B|63| B: [Well] [I] mean [, you know _, I] think_ [, uh ,] once Jimmy Johnson gets _his_ system established [, uh ,] they'll [do] [all] [right .] 
A|64| A: [Yeah .] 
B|65| B: Huh-uh . 
A|66| A: [Yeah .]

B|69| B: [That's] [what] [I] thought . 
A|70| A: [And] he'd never [been] outside [, like [,] you know ,] by himself outside . 
B|71| B: [and , [and] they] sit down [and they] look [at] [you] [right] [in the] face [and they] expect [a] truthful answer . 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: _So_ [, it's] [got] [real] high ceilings [on] [half] [the] house [and] [the] [other] [half] [is] [just] standard sized ceilings . 
A|74| A: [I think] [it] [, I think] [it was] [his] shoulder [he] had surgery [on] [. But] anyway [, they're] trying [to] keep him [, you know ,] keep him [, uh ,] from reinjuring [anything] , [but] anyway 
B|75| B: [she] doesn't [have a] brown nose [, and] [her] [she's] sort [of] unicolor [, you know ,] eyes [are] [the] same color [and] everything , 
A|76| A: [So] [of] course [, I] had [to] take him [. I] felt [so] sorry [for] him [after] [that] . 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [Um [,] yeah] [, I] don't [, I] don't , certainly capital punishment isn't [going to] solve [a lot of] problems 
B|79| B: [You] [know ,] there's [so] [much] [of] [it] [going] [on] [that] [it would] really [, you know [,] uh ,] set [us] into [a] deeper depression if [we knew] [the] whole picture .
