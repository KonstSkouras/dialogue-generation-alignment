A|50| A: _Uh-huh ,_ uh-huh . 
B|51| B: Oh . 
A|52| A: [I] [can] [just] make [out] his place [, you [know] .] I've [got] [a] thirty mile view [to] [the] east [and] about ten miles [to] [the] north . 
B|53| B: _No_ [, I] [did] [not] [. [I] ,] 
A|54| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: Now _when_ [was] [that ,] _when_ [were] [you] [there] ? 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [Well [,] you] could _probably_ sue _him_ [for] [mental] anguish [or] [something] , [right] [, and] try [to] [get] _money_ _from_ _him_ 
A|58| A: _But_ [they're] [not] [that] [much] fun [, you know [,] you] [can't] take [them] [for] [a] walk [, you] [can't] [, you know [,] they , they] [don't] [, _they] can't_ fetch [, you know ,] 
B|59| B: [Well] [the] _German Shepherd_ [that] _I had_ before [, we] [, [we] _had] _a_ little_ pool , 
A|60| A: [Well ,] [what I] believe [is] [one] [of the] major [uh ,] _things_ [that is] wrong with [our] public school system [is] [that _,] um [,_ [we] [do] not] [have] enough discipline 
B|61| B: _No_ , somebody played [it] 
A|62| A: Money [from] , [money] [for] taking [care] [of the] infants takes [money] away [from] taking [care] [of the] elderly , [or] [do] [they] both [get] served ? [Uh] [, that's] [a] [good] point . 
B|63| B: [and so] [we] use those [and] [there's] [some] , whenever [we] _go_ [over] [and] visit grandma [the] kids love [to] play [the] computer [game] [, [so] [,] that's] part [of] [it .] 
A|64| A: Yep . 
B|65| B: [Uh-huh [,] that's] [right] [, they] pull [the] strings . 
A|66| A: We're [to] discuss [a little] bit about [the] process [of] putting _someone_ [in] [a] nursing home [and] making [the] decision [on] [a] [family] basis [and ,] [probably] [the] [first] question [would] [be] whether you've ever [had] _to go_ through [that] process . 
B|67| B: [Yeah .] Wasn't [that] [what] part [of the] lottery [is] _going_ [to go] [for] [, if] [we] approve [it] ? 
A|68| A: [Yeah] 
B|69| B: _Um_ [, well] , [see] [it's] [more] _my_ grandma [that] feels [that] way . 
A|70| A: [Where are] [you] [going] studying ? 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: [I] guess [my] , [my] [best] [would] [be] [probably] sixty-eight [when] [you] wake [up] [or] sixty-six [, and] then [probably] seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|73| B: [Yeah .] 
A|74| A: [Yeah] _But_ [I think] [I] [I] [Yeah] [I] [I] [I] guess [the] idea _you know they_ [always] [keep] saying [like the] framers . [Um] . [there] [uh] [one] [of the] Republican [the] appointees [for] [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] [always] talk about [they] feel [that] [this] person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what] [the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set [down] . 
B|75| B: Oh [, okay .] 
A|76| A: This , [this] friend [of] mine has [, well] [it's] [the] same guy [that] [was] watching [, uh ,] [my] [German Shepherd] [when] [he] [got] hit [, but] [, uh ,] went fishing with [him] [on] Friday [and] took , he's [got] [a] full [, a] pure bred Golden Retriever [and] then [I had] [, uh [,] the] puppy [, [a] little] tiny puppy [and] [we] went [and] took [the] two dogs [up] fishing . [And] [this] [, they] [just] [, they] [had a] ball romping around , 
B|77| B: [Um] , usually [, uh ,] word processing [something] [, um ,] such [as ,] oh , forms [for] [things] [, uh ,] 
A|78| A: [Yeah .] 
B|79| B: [And] boy [that] [thing] screams now . 
A|80| A: [No] earthly idea . 
B|81| B: Oh . 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . 
B|83| B: So , 
A|84| A: Because otherwise [what] [you're] [doing] [is] [you're] letting people [in] [and] [you're] [, you're] dooming [them] [to] being underclass people . 
B|85| B: Oh [, okay .] You're [going] [to] Commerce ? 
A|86| A: [Yeah .] 
B|87| B: [But] [it's [,] it's] [so] lonely [, [you know] [they] can't] [get] [out] [and] [see] anyone [and I] mean [, it's hard] [for] [, for] [someone] [like] me [to] understand [that] 
A|88| A: [and so] [I] never [, you know ,] [got] [out] by myself , [or] [not] [much] ,
