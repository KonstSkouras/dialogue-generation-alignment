B|67| B: [Yeah , I] housesat [from] [cats] [for a] friend [of] mine which she [was] finishing [up] her thesis , 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] [Well [,] they] [, they] [just] don't [do] [that] any [more] . 
B|69| B: [Uh ,] [what] _I've_ gotten into [more] recently are [the] tools [to] use [them] . Have [you] , 
A|70| A: _It_ [was a] joy [in] talking [with] [you] . 
B|71| B: [I think] [they] compare [you know ,] fairly [well] . 
A|72| A: [Oh ,] yeah . 
B|73| B: [I [, I] ,] [everything] _is_ [so] automated [, uh [,] and] things [can] [be made] [without] [, I think] [a] human hand ever touching [it [,] you know] [an] awful [lot of] things , 
A|74| A: See , [I've] only [been] [to] Texas once . [I] [have] two sisters [in] Texas [now] , um , [one] [in] Austin , [one] [in] Dallas [, and] [the] [one] [in] Dallas [is] [the] [one that] got [me] [to] doing [this] 
B|75| B: That happens [on] occasion [, it] [sure] does , maybe [it] [just] depends [on] [, you know ,] how closely [the] crime [, you know ,] has affected [you] personally . 
A|76| A: [that's] true . But [I] [was] thinking boy , [in] Dallas , [if] somebody asked [me] [if] there [were] places [you] wouldn't go by yourself at night , I'd [have] [to] set [them] down [for] about five [or] ten minutes [to] list [all] [the] places [out .] 
B|77| B: [Oh .] 
A|78| A: [and ,] um [, my] husband [is] [a] ham radio operator [and] [I think] about [all] [the] [people] [that] [he] talks [to] [all] over [the ,] 
B|79| B: Really ? Huh [. It] [really] has [been] strange [here] [this year] [, [I mean] [,] this] [whole] [course] [this] [whole] [year] has [been] [a] different [year] [in] [more] ways than [one] .
