A|42| A: [That's] [right] . 
B|43| B: [Oh] . 
A|44| A: [Right .] 
B|45| B: [Oh _,] I'm_ glad _my_ husband's [not] [like that] either , I'd kill him My brother's [like [that] and [,] um ,] _see_ he goes [to] [a lot of] games _, not_ [a real] [lot] _, but_ he tries [to go] _, then_ _my_ father [got] _us_ [some] _tickets_ , 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh _.] So_ [, you] , [what] [you're] saying [is] [this ,] _if_ [there] [is] [the] second offense [, then] [you] execute [them .] 
B|47| B: [Well [,] I] understand [that] [you _know] ._ [if] , needs [and] wants were [the] same I'd [have a] four eighty-six machine _at_ home

B|51| B: [Yeah .] 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] Really , oh _, that_ would [be] , 
B|53| B: _And _,_ I'm_ [like [,] _I] don't_ believe [this] . 
A|54| A: oh , sure , [because] [if] [you] [take it] _into_ [a] service station [, they] [want] [to] charge [you] forty dollars [just] [for] [, uh ,] freon , _which_ only costs [you] [about] three dollars 
B|55| B: _Huh ?_ 
A|56| A: [Well ,] that's [kind [of] the] way our living room [and] dining room [is] , 
B|57| B: Nice talking [to] [you] . 
A|58| A: [Uh] 
B|59| B: [and , uh ,] 
A|60| A: _and I_ sort [of] [, I] [see] perspectives [on] all sides . _Um_ , [and] [I've] [have] no hope [for] solutions [. But] _, uh , I_ [do] [keep] myself somewhat abreast [of the] issue [. I] [have] worked [with] [, uh [,] uh ,] _a little_ [bit] [with] refugees [from] , Southeast Asia [, uh ,] who've _come_ over . [Uh [,] you know ,] [to] escape [the] genocide programs [that] _are_ over [there] . [And] _seen_ [, you know ,] heard [about] [some] [of the] problems [that] they've [had] . [And] [I'm] [also] fairly sensitive [to the] issues [about] [how] open [should] [the] borders [be] . Because [I ,] [in] general , [like] [a] smaller rather than [a] larger population , [to the] land area . 
B|61| B: [Right .] [You know ,] [the] war last winter [was] certainly [a] _good_ example [of] [that] [because] [we] saw every single [thing] , practically . 
A|62| A: [And [,] uh [,] yeah] [I] [was] amazed . Really [good] temperament [and] [very] playful [and] affectionate [, good] personality [. _I don't] know _,_ I can't_ imagine [what] [, uh ,] would [have] _been_ wrong [with] [this] dog , _so_ . 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh [,] yeah] . 
A|64| A: [Right .] 
B|65| B: he _was going to_ [keep] him as [the] coach somehow _, but_ [, uh , [I] don't know ,] I'd [like] [to] [see] [the] Vikings [get] revamped somehow . 
A|66| A: [I don't [know] .] [Huh] . * See note above 
B|67| B: [Um] . 
A|68| A: _I , I_ wasn't helping _them . I_ worked [with] [them] [, not] [to] help [them] [, but] [for] [my] own purposes . [I'm] [, I'm] [a] linguist _and I_ [was] [, uh ,] [doing] [a] language , trying [to] learn [their] language , _a little_ [bit] . [And] [I] _actually_ [, um _,] I mean ,_ [helped them] [them] [in] [the] sense [that] [they] received [money] [for] working [with] me _. But I_ didn't [, I] didn't [, I] wasn't [a] social worker or anything [like [that] .] 
B|69| B: [Oh ,] we've [got] _, well_ [the] _two_ [that] were outside , _they're_ [like] brothers [, I mean] [I've] never [seen] _two_ cats [so] close . 
A|70| A: When [they're] skiing [they're] fearless , _and they_ [go off] , 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [see] [you] [don't] necessarily [have to] dip [this] stuff . [And , um [,] I] [was going _to] have_ broccoli [and] cauliflower [for] [a] , [a] vegetable . 
B|73| B: Two cats . 
A|74| A: [It] [is] [kind of] expensive [, [it] is] . 
B|75| B: [I [, I] can't] identify [them] either [. I] [just] [like] [them . I] could [, I] [know] [which] ones [come] _next_ [, but] [I don't] even [know] [their] names . Most [of them] [I don't know] [their] names [of the] song [, but] [I , I] can identify [them [.] But I] [like [that] [and] I] [like [,] uh ,] course [I , I] [like] classical music . 
A|76| A: [Yeah [,] well] [I'm] planning [a] , [and] naturally [this] [is] [appropriate] [because] [I'm] planning dinner [for] [people] tomorrow night [and then] [the] [next] night . 
B|77| B: [Oh ,] wow . 
A|78| A: [Huh ?] [Uh-huh .] [I'm] sure 
B|79| B: Exactly . 
A|80| A: Yes . 
B|81| B: [Uh-huh .] No , even [that] [, that] [really] [, I think] [, [I] don't] [, it's] [been] awhile since [I've] looked _at_ , [my] youngest child [is] eight [. So] [it's] [been] [a little] while since [I've] looked [into] , [actually] daycare centers [. But] [they] [are] 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh ,] uh-huh . 
B|83| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [but] [, you know ,] Escort [is] supposed [to [have] a] great track record as far as sales . 
A|86| A: oh [, yeah] , [we] [they] called [us] [at] five [and] [the] game started [at] seven [so] [we] [just] threw everything together , ran over [and] [got] [the] [tickets] [and] walked [and] [so] [we] took [two] kids [with] [us] [and] nobody brings [two] children [in] these seats [, you know] [because] , 
B|87| B: [But] [it [,] it] makes [a] great [, I mean [,] I've] [got] [a] [two] year old [and] [a] four year old [and they] love [it .]
