A|8| A: _Right_ . [they] 
B|9| B: _Yeah . Well_ [I] lived down _in ,_ down _in_ _the_ bottom _of a_ big hollow _and_ _we had_ [to] _pretty_ _much_ hike _out_ _most of the_ _time_ .

B|15| B: _Yes ,_ yes . 
A|16| A: _But ,_ unemployment [now] [in] Dallas , [or] [in] Texas [is] [up] _around_ six _point ,_ 
B|17| B: _but_ [they] talk _about_ _things_ _that [I_ ,] _my_ brother _didn't_ talk _about_ _until_ _he_ [was] [in] college [you know ,] 
A|18| A: [I] [would] [not] imagine [that] . 
B|19| B: [That's] _true_ . 
A|20| A: _My_ [problem] [is] _I don't_ _want to_ wake [up] _another_ half hour earlier [and] [do] [more] 
B|21| B: [But] [we] did [, we] [really] truly did pay [a] fortune _. _I_ mean_ [we] [were] paying _at_ [one] [point _,] well_ _about ,_ _about_ [a] , close , _about_ five hundred dollars [a] _week_ [for] _two_ [children] . 
A|22| A: [It] wasn't _too_ [much] [of a] job , _really ._ 
B|23| B: _It was_ _her_ ex boyfriend [and _,] you know , just_ [was] [not] mature enough _to keep_ [the] dog , _didn't_ realize _how_ [much] work _it was_ [and] _now ,_ she's [stuck] [with] _it ._ 
A|24| A: That _there's_ _no_ [problem] [with] getting [them] [to] , [do] [stuff .] 
B|25| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|26| A: _and so_ _I kind of_ stay 
B|27| B: At least [they're] coming [around] . 
A|28| A: _Yeah [,_ [that] [,] that] [would] _all_ _start_ [at] , [at] _, um [,_ that] [would] _all_ _start_ [at] , [at] eight o'clock here [, that] wouldn't _start_ [at] seven _.

B|29| B: [we] invariably end [up] [at] _my_ house since _I've_ [got] _two_ _kids_ . 
A|30| A: [they] paid fifty-eight [for] [it .] 
B|31| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|32| A: _It's_ [pretty] soon . 
B|33| B: [just] , pick _up and_ _head_ _on_ _out_ . 
A|34| A: [But] [he] likes [to] [have a] spot [to keep] _all_ [of] _his _,_ his_ piddling _things ._ 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|37| B: _Huh ._ 
A|38| A: [Yeah . Well] _, she_ stayed _, she_ stayed [in] [a] temporary nursing _home_ . Until _she_ [was] _okay_ . 
B|39| B: _Huh_ _, yeah_ . 
A|40| A: [and , uh _,] [it_ was] _nice_ talking [to] [you] . 
B|41| B: [And] [, uh [,] they're] looking [at] where [you have a] battery operated [car] basically _, but_ [it] _has_ [a] [, a] engine [in] [the] back [that] charges [it .] 
A|42| A: [yeah] , _it's the_ unsweetened [kind] _it's_ [not] [like] Nestles Quik . 
B|43| B: Kind [of] radical [, I] [know] _but_ , 
A|44| A: _Um_ . 
B|45| B: [But [,] you know ,] [there's] [there's] [a lot of] taxes [you] pay [that] you're [not] even aware [of] [that] you're paying [, uh _,] like_ [when you] buy [a] tire [, you] pay [a] federal excise tax . 
A|46| A: [I] [is] , [is] [that] [the] newest [thing] [now [,] the] four eighty-six ? 
B|47| B: [Right] [, _the] first_ appeal [is] automatic _, so_ [that] delays [it] [for [a] few years] [just] [right] off [the] bat . 
A|48| A: [they] [they] [can't] [do] anything [, so] [I've] never [, I think] [we had] fish [when I was] [a] kid _but _I_ don't_ , 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: _Um _,_ I had a_ friend who [went to] Colombia _and I_ _used_ [to] _go_ [up and] visit [her] . 
B|51| B: [Um ,] _my_ husband _has_ [used] [the] [one] [at] [his] folks house [for] mostly business [things _.] Uh [,_ his] resume [, [his] [,] uh ,] letter , 
A|52| A: [Well] _, um ,_ actually _it ,_ we've _sort of_ [had] an ideal Spring . 
B|53| B: You [know [,] she] loves everybody _. And_ little _kids_ _can_ [just] [, you know ,] maul [all] over [her] , 
A|54| A: [And] [they had] us fill [out] [a] long questionnaire _. We_ stayed till [about] [one] thirty _and they're_ _going to_ call [the] ones [that] [they're] interested [in] from [the] questionnaire [two] [to] three [at] [a] [time] _and the_ trial won't _take_ place [until] June . 
B|55| B: [Yeah .] 
A|56| A: Bye-bye . 
B|57| B: [Yeah _,] just_ [a] little bit 
A|58| A: True . 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|61| B: Really . 
A|62| A: [And] [so] , [one] day _I got_ [up and] thought [well] [I] _will_ [just] _go_ casual [and] [you know] [that I] called _on a_ guy wearing exactly [that ,] bib overalls _, and_ [he] _sort of_ told _me_ [that] [he] expected _me_ [to be] professional 
B|63| B: _Oh ,_ [okay] 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [Uh-huh _.] I_ see . 
A|66| A: _it's_ [just] [that , I] [didn't] [, I] hate having [to be] [in] charge [of] someone else's life . 
B|67| B: Again . 
A|68| A: That [is] an intriguing [type of] book [to be] reading [and] [trying [to] keep] [up] [on] [things like that] . 
B|69| B: _Huh ._ 
A|70| A: They're [not] _going to_ recruit _me_ anymore , I'm _through_ . No [more] [for] _me ._ 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and] fortunately [it was] [just] [like] [a] retriever [and then] [I've] [had a] retriever . 
A|74| A: [Oh [,] just] our [own design] . 
B|75| B: [Yeah _,] yeah_ . 
A|76| A: [Yeah ,] _that's_ [a] good idea . 
B|77| B: [we had] five [children] [, so] [and] they've [all] moved [you know ,] [on] . 
A|78| A: [But ,] typically [, you know [,] uh ,] typically [, uh ,] everyone gets involved [in [,] uh [,] the] jury _process_ _and I_ suppose an elitist might say [, well] [, you] [really] _want_ someone who [is] [well] educated [to be] able [to] , [to] winnow [the] facts from [the ,] from [the] prejudice . 
B|79| B: [And] [then] [they] [take] these [things] [that] [will] rust [and they] throw [them] [in] [the] ocean which [is] [going to] speedup [the] [process] even [more] . 
A|80| A: [Uh [,] I] believe [in] _it _,_ too_ 
B|81| B: [and [it's] the] Alsatian [that's] [the] kid's dog . [It's] [just] [, you] see [them] [in] Europe [and they're] [just] lovely . 
A|82| A: [I mean] [they're] nomadic farmers [, you know [,] they're] [people] who farm [on] [the] hillside [and then] leave [the] hillside [to] _another_ hillside [and] farm [on] [that] hillside . 
B|83| B: [that's] what _my_ husband said [, so] _this_ _last year_ [he] changed [it ,] [of] course [, we] [didn't] [get] hardly [and then] nearly _as_ [much] back [and] [it was] [like] oh , [no] . Better find [another] _way_ [of] saving money 
A|84| A: [It was] _nice_ talking [to] [you] _too ._ Bye-bye . 
B|85| B: Let's see , *something missing ? A . 1 ? _my_ husband does [the] majority _of [the_ [,] um , the [,] uh ,] gardening [, uh ,] taking care _of the_ lawn [and] fertilizing _, but_ [, I [,] um ,] tend [to] [all] [the ,] planting [the] annuals [and , [and] the] spraying [and [,] um ,] taking care [of] [them] [and] _maybe_ putting flowers [in [,] you know ,] throughout [that] season [, and] later [on] _maybe_ planting _some_ mums [and that] [kind of] [stuff] [and [,] um ,] any [kind of] decorating [for] [the] holidays [, you know ,] 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [Yeah . Well] [I had] [, I had a] German Shepherd before _this_ [one] [and] [when] [she] died [it] [just] [, it] [just] absolutely destroyed [me _.] [I_ mean] [I was] [just] [, you know ,] 
A|88| A: [Uh-huh [.] Uh [,] so] [, I ,] [most of the] [kids] here [, I [,] you know [,] like] [, you know , just] from dorm mates [and stuff] , they'll say [that] [they] _don't_ believe [in] [it [,] but] [then after] [I] [would] say [my] [point] [of] view [, then] they'll say [, well] [, yeah] [, you know [,] you know] . 
B|89| B: [I mean] [it] sounds [like] [a] train [. We have] wooden floors [and so] [it] [just] [sort of] echoes [through] [the] house 
A|90| A: Exactly [. Uh ,] I'm [not] sure [about] Pennsylvania , whether [we] [have] [it] [or] [not] . For [some] reason [I was] thinking [that] [we] [do] [, but] [it's] [, you know ,] [it's] [not] very often [. [I] think] [maybe] [last year] [was [the] first] [time] [in] [like] eighteen [years] [or] something [like [that] [,] that] anyone anyone from Pennsylvania [had] gotten [it .] 
B|91| B: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
A|92| A: [And] _he's_ their [head] chauffeur , [is] [this] funny _, as_ [they're] parking [the] cars [the] valet service . 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [Yes] [. And] [that [,] the] other major factor [is] [that] [she] needs blood transfusions every [week] [to] ten days [, and] [would] [have] [to be] hospitalized [a] day [or] [two] [, so] [in] [this] facility [they can] [do] [it] [right] [there] from [her] [own] room 
B|95| B: [Oh] [no] . 
A|96| A: [Huh .] 
B|97| B: So [, we] [, we] rely [pretty] , [pretty] heavily [, I think] , [on a] combination [of [the] ,] [of the] [two] [. I] also [, uh ,] [use] [, uh ,] NEWSWEEK magazine [. Uh ,] 
A|98| A: _I don't_ [think] [so] . 
B|99| B: [Yeah [,] I] read [that , [too] [.] [I] got] [it [,] uh ,] [right] , [after] [it] came [out] . [My] [, uh [,] you know ,] 
A|100| A: [My] daughter graduated [with] [her] from Arlington High School . 
B|101| B: Ooh . 
A|102| A: [so] [, [I] mean] , I'm [used] , I'm [used] [to] having cats [around] [, I] [like] _them ._ 
B|103| B: Trying [to] remember [we [had] a] dog [for a] while [, [and] [I] don't] [know] [if] [we] [got] rid [of the] dog [because] [my] brother [was] allergic [to] [it ,] [my] brother [had] asthma [and] [some] allergies which [I think] [he's] outgrown [now ,] 
A|104| A: [and] [you [,] and] [you [,] you know] [the ,] 
B|105| B: [I] work [and] [go] [to] school [and it's] [kind of] [nice] [you] come [home] your , your pet's [there] [for] [you] [and] wants [a] little food [a] little attention . 
A|106| A: [We] [found] [this] Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg . 
B|107| B: [I think] five minutes [is] [the] max . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh] , [now] [there] [have] been worse summers . In fact [this] morning [when] [they] [were] talking [about [,] uh ,] Harold Taft , [they] [were] talking [about] [how] [this] [has] been [one] [of the] milder [of the] summers [and] milder fall , 
B|109| B: [but I] feel closer [to] [them] [, because] [I kind of] grew [up] [with] [them .] [But ,] [But [,] uh [,] as] [, you know ,] [for] [the] rest [of] [that] group , [no] [not] [really .] 
A|110| A: Good [point] . [That's] [a] good [point] . 
B|111| B: [Yeah .] 
A|112| A: [That's] probably [true] considering , [Yes] . [Yes [,] uh [,] I] guess [in] [a] [way] [that [,] [it] [,] it] [kind of] defeats [the] purpose [of] having capital punishment [if] ,
