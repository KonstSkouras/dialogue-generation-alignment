B|35| B: What did [you] wind up [with ?] 
A|36| A: [You know _,] um [,_ [I [,] I] think] nursing homes [are] , [are] _, um ,_ _some_ [are] [good] 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [.] Right .] [It] used [to be] [that] _we_ were _, that_ _we_ were trying [to] protect morality . _Now_ [it's] we're protecting [our] lives . It's [a] [it's a] [much] _different_ , 
B|39| B: [Oh] . 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] Sure 
B|41| B: _Well ,_ we've tried having , let me _turn_ [the] T V _off_ , we've tried having [a] vegetable garden [, and] _I'm_ _from_ Chicago [, and] _the way_ _that , uh ,_ bugs [and] weeds grow down _here_ [is] _very_ [different] _from_ Chicago _. And_ [we] [have] tried several _years_ [in] [a] row [, and] we've given up , between [the] fire ants _, the_ pill bugs _, the_ weeds _, the_ drought [, and] [a] hundred [and] _ten_ degree heat _all_ Summer [, and] [we] _just_ _kind of_ [, uh ,] decided _to go_ _with _a_ few_ flowers [and] give up _on the_ vegetable garden 
A|42| A: [and , uh ,] once [you] kill [off] [a few] [of] _them_ 
B|43| B: _but_ _they _don't_ know_ where _to go_ [to] [, to] [, _to] do_ _anything_ . 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] _So_ they're pretty [good] kids [, huh] ? 
B|45| B: Were [you] up _in ,_ [in] Wisconsin _or_ _would_ [you] _go_ _into_ where _would_ [you] camp ? 
A|46| A: Somehow [I just] _think [,_ you [know ,] I] [like] [the] idea 
B|47| B: [have] [you] noticed _that _on_ the_ bottom [of] plastic goods _, they_ [have] [this] little number now [that] tells [what] _kind of_ plastic _it_ [is] ? 
A|48| A: [Yeah [,] I] [wouldn't] [like] [anything] _of that_ nature [, you know ,] 
B|49| B: [Oh] [that's] [good] . [Oh] [we] [just] [, uh _,] just_ love [them] _. _They_ _,_ uh [, you know_ ,] _get_ [to] feeling [so] lovey [and] dovey [and] they'll come up [and] [just] _start_ kneading [in] [our] chest _and it's_ [like] oh , your claws _need_ trimming . 
A|50| A: _Okay ,_ _looks_ [like] we're _ready_ [to go] . Capital punishment _, uh , the_ problem _I have_ [with] capital punishment [is] [that _, uh ,] uh [,_ it's] supposed [to be] [a] deterrent [to] crime _, but_ [I don't] [think] [that] [it really] [actually] does [that] [. [I] don't] [think] [it] deters anybody _, because_ [most] [of] [the] [time] crimes [are] [, uh ,] [are] committed [with a] , without any thought [to] [the] consequences [and] [they don't] [think] [that , uh ,] stop [and] [think] [and] _say [,_ well _,] maybe_ [I] shouldn't [do] [this] [, uh _,] because_ [, uh [,] I] might [get] [the] gas chamber [or] something [like that] [. They] _worry [about_ it] _afterwards_ [and] _then_ [they] try [and] [get] out _of _it_ [._ And [,] uh ,] _how_ [about] [you] 
B|51| B: Yearly fee _, yeah ._ 
A|52| A: _Okay ._ 
B|53| B: [And] [it] _would be_ [just] , 
A|54| A: [and] [they] [, [and] , and] [they] certainly _can't_ carry [it] themselves 
B|55| B: [And [,] I think] [a] _great_ number [of] [students] who got word [of it] [and] participated [in] general [and] voiced who heard [about] [the] program . 
A|56| A: [and , uh _,] but_ he will [turn] [that _on] _,_ especially_ [for] [, if] , again [, if] [our] [, uh ,] oldest grandson [is] over _here ._ He's [ten] 
B|57| B: But [that's] [because] [it's] [so] old . 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: [So] [, _it's] [,_ uh ,] [so] [, the] question [of] _whether_ [to] _buy_ [here] [or] move [to] another county _, [say_ ,] drive twenty _more_ miles north , _buy_ [a] condominium [for] approximately [, uh , the] same price [, maybe] [a] little lower [, but] [the] taxes _would be [,_ you know ,] perhaps [, maybe] one-third [uh ,] [of] , 
A|60| A: [Right .] 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [Yeah [,] I] [was] [kind of] surprised _how_ rapidly [they] bypassed [, the] three eighty-six [. That] wasn't alive [for] [but] [maybe] two [years] . 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: _Okay ._ _Uh ,_ [do] [you] own [a] P C by [the way] ? [I'm] guessing [you] [probably] [do] . 
B|65| B: _Oh ,_ super . 
A|66| A: [Yeah .] 
B|67| B: [And] [I'm] [really] pleased [with] [it .] 
A|68| A: Wow _. Um ,_ [do] [the] skunk [, uh ,] [was] [it] _kind of _like_ a_ cat [to] [have] around [the] house ? 
B|69| B: [Um] . 
A|70| A: If [, if] [, if] [I] had [the] [car] [I] wanted . 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: _Well , _I_ really_ [do] [, I think] [you] [have] [to] budget those [things] though . 
B|73| B: [I mean] [I mean ,] [I'm] thinking [of] an extreme case [like a] serial murderer 
A|74| A: _yeah [,_ it's] [great] [, it's] [great] [, and] [what] else [do] _I do_ _, I do_ lots [of] cross stitching [when _I] have_ [time] 
B|75| B: [Well [, I] do] [think] [with] working parents [it] [is] _, I mean ,_ [there] [are] [some] real issues [here [.] Um [,] _that] I [think_ [,] um ,] 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: _Oh _, yeah_ ._ 
A|78| A: [and I] thought [that was] [, you know ,] [very] interesting [and [I] , I] [would] [have] thought _of that_ earlier [I] [probably] [would] _have done_ [, you know [,] just] _like ,_ [is] [that ,] [is] [this] , [is] [that] [the] Mormon church [, that] does [that] ? 
B|79| B: [so] [I really] [don't] [worry about] [anything] . 
A|80| A: [I] [was] [going] [to] [say ,] my sister wasn't spoiled [very] [much] . 
B|81| B: _No_ , [in] fact , [in] fact [the] Cowboys got [the] best _end [of_ that] _deal_ . 
A|82| A: [I] [like] [the] course [, but] [I don't] [play] over [there] [because] [, you] [, [they] don't] [, uh , you know] [don't] allow [you] [to] pull [a] cart . 
B|83| B: [Yeah [,] just] _work_ , [short] trips . _No_ no heavy mileage . [I'm] putting [on] less than fifteen thousand miles [a] [year .] 
A|84| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [Um ,] [I'm] twenty . 
A|86| A: [I] _know ._ 
B|87| B: [I think] [so] . 
A|88| A: [but] yet [they] want spend [the] [money] [to] build [the] new jails [that [,] I mean [,] they] [really] [are] over , crowded , 
B|89| B: _Oh ,_ ho-ho . 
A|90| A: [I [, I] think] [that] [would be [,] I] am sure _there is_ something out [there] [, uh ,] , 
B|91| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [Yeah [,] [and] , [and] [it's] [,] I think] [what] [they] [need] [to do] [is] stop building [more] jails [and] [start] giving stiffer sentences [, uh [,] but] [for the] , 
B|93| B: Make [it] financially [, uh ,] attractive [to] recycle 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [so] [that's] _not_ [so] bad [, you [know] .] 
A|96| A: [Yeah .] 
B|97| B: [So] [I] guess [I] [can't] [really] [I] [can't] [say] [what] [it] [would be] [like] [to] [, uh ,] grow up [in] [a] [really] oppressed region 
A|98| A: [Oh _, yeah] [,_ if you] [if you can] [, yeah .] 
B|99| B: [Okay .] 
A|100| A: [Oh [,] well] [that's] interesting . 
B|101| B: plus [it's] real easy _on the_ hostess [, because] [you can] [just] [have] [the] potatoes [ready] [, and] [just] [have a] salad [with] _it [,_ _and] you_ got [a] [great] dinner . 
A|102| A: [So] [that was] [really] [fun] . 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [No .] Businesses [, uh] [if] purchasing [things] mail order [, if] [, if] [I'm a] computer consulting firm [and I] [see] these , [this] [great] [deal] [on] forty-six mother boards [, uh _,] from_ _, from_ [say] Utah [. Um [,] [I ,] I] might [buy] [the] mother boards [from] Utah [but] _then_ still [have] [to] pay Pennsylvania sales tax . My accounting department will at [the] [end of] [the] month [. [I] think] [that I think] [that's] [the way] [things] [work] [in] Pennsylvania [. [And] I] [know] [they] [work] [that] [way] [in [,] uh [,] say] [here] [in] D C . 
B|105| B: [Now] why [would] [you] [go] [to] [a] seafood restaurant [to] eat chicken ? 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] 
B|107| B: [Okay ,] he's [, uh , uh ,] south [of] Renner [on ,] [on] Custer [. And] [there [is] a] little bitty mall [that] [looks] [kind of [like] ,] [or] , strip [kind of] center . 
A|108| A: [And [,] you know ,] gardening isn't , isn't high [on the] list [, but] [it's] [not] [off] [the] list . 
B|109| B: [They] always [say] you've talked your [ten] minute limit . 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [Uh-huh [.] And] [then] [how] [would] [you] feel [afterwards] [when] [you] came up negative [and [,] you know ,] your supervisor has accused [you] [of] using drugs . 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [Uh ,] uh-huh . 
A|114| A: [Well] [it [,] [I ,] I] agree [with] [you] [there] [because] [I] [know] every [time] [that] something comes [into] vogue [all] [the] [money] goes [to] [that] [one] [and you] [don't know] [whether] [it's] still also [going] [to] [the] [other] [or] [if] [it's a] limited pie . 
B|115| B: [but] people [that [I] have] known [that] [have done] [that ,] [like] [from] [other] countries [, especially] [, from] Germany [and] Finland [, um [,] they] [are] [just] [, they] [have] such [a] better , [more] mature , outlook [on] life 
A|116| A: [They [,] they] went [to] [all] , [all] ... 
B|117| B: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] I think] [so]
