A|36| A: _Yeah [,_ I] _think _that_ is_ _an_ excellent program [, I] _really_ [do] [. _I] [like_ _that] ._ [And] [it's , it's] beneficial [to] [the] small towns [too] _because_ [, they] _really_ , _really_ [have] [, [have] a] disadvantage [that] _we_ wouldn't understand _because_ we're [in the] Metroplex . 
B|37| B: [And] [, uh [,] but] based [, you know _,] in_ terms [of [,] you know _,] in_ _, in_ Pensacola _, in_ [that] area [of] Florida _it [,_ uh [,] it's] [what] [now] [, it] [is] [, uh ,] [probably] ten years old .

B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: _so_ [it] might _have [to_ be] [something] [that] [they] might consider doing _as_ [a] [that's] [got] [to be] very short term . 
B|43| B: [I] [I] sure wish [they] could build basements [in] homes [in] Texas . 
A|44| A: [And] [that] _really_ [gets] _kind of_ aggravating after [a] while _because_ you're [saying ,] [Well [,] I] [work] full [time too] _, you know ._ 
B|45| B: You [know [,] [I] like] [what] [he] says [, and] he'll [be] [so] far off [the] wall [that] they'll elect him . 
A|46| A: With _children_ ,

B|53| B: _I mean_ _there_ [was] [, um ,] [people] [at] Stanford who [were] soaking [the] government [, you know ,] using millions [of] dollars [of] research [money] [to [,] uh [,] [for] the] President [to] buy beach homes [or] whatever [it was] . 
A|54| A: [and , uh ,] _kind of_ [have] , _if_ you're _having_ [the] pressures [of] [school] [and , uh ,] everything else [, it's] _kind [of_ ,] course [it's] _really_ [, you know ,] _as_ soon _as_ [you do] [it [,] it's] _really_ [a] release . 
B|55| B: [Yeah .]

A|64| A: What about [, uh ,] white collar crimes [like [,] uh ,] theft [of] trade secrets . 
B|65| B: [Yeah [.] Well ,] [I'm] [just] [saying] _that , that [,_ that's] [what] [, [the] [,] the] client , lawyers [are] [saying] . They're [saying] [that [,] you know [,] you know ,] [more] [of my] clients [would] [have] pleaded guilty [if [they] would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly [having] [to ,] [to ,] [to get] [a] death sentence [because you] can't plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] going [to be] . 
A|66| A: [And] [he] [was] [the] last [one] she carried across [, [you know ,] the] [whole] [big] sad story . 
B|67| B: Kind [of [,] uh ,] [little] guy [in] _there ._ He [, he] [, uh ,] gives reasonable prices .
