A|32| A: How [do you] dress [for] work ? 
B|33| B: _and [you_ know , if [you] can] [do] any [a little bit] [, it] helps [, so] 
A|34| A: Huh . 
B|35| B: [And] [I] [was] reading [this] book one _time_ _about_ [this] guy [that] had [, uh , I think] [the] company [still] exists . _What_ [they] use [to do] _is [,_ they] used [to] cut [the] number [of] hours [for] everybody _as_ opposed [to] [just] laying [people] off _you know ._ 
A|36| A: It stays nice [and] fresh . 
B|37| B: Uh , then [you] [don't] draw [a] line between public property [and] [uh] [uh] [uh] [what] [a] public [uh] symbol .

B|39| B: [Yeah .] So [, uh , yeah ,] [we] _spend_ [a lot of] _time_ [, uh [,] uh ,] carpooling _and [,_ uh [,] you know [,] and] then trying [to] [be] [, uh ,] [up] _as_ _much_ _as_ possible with _anything_ [that they _,] [that_ they] [do .] 
A|40| A: Uh-huh _. The_ Really ? Okay . 
B|41| B: [I think] [that I] would [like] [to [,] if [you] know ,] [we] [all] [say [,] _if] I_ could _have the_ car [I] always wanted [I] would either buy [a] Nissan Maxima [, uh ,] 
A|42| A: [Oh ,] _okay ._ 
B|43| B: [Yeah [,] yeah ,] 
A|44| A: [I] [just] [don't] hear [much] [about] [it] anymore . Like [I] [say [,] [I] don't] even [know] [what] programs [are] , [are] even ongoing [now [,] [you know] .] 
B|45| B: _and I_ [like] [I] [like , uh [,] uh ,] let me [think] [who] [, uh [,] you] [don't know] Hebert Laws [, but] Hebert Laws [a] flute player , he's [a] jazz flute player _and I_ [like , uh [,] uh ,] Chuck Mangione , [do [you] know] [who] Chuck Mangione [is] ? 
A|46| A: [Yeah _,] that's_ true . 
B|47| B: [And] [I] [, so [I] mean ,] [how] [I] would [go] [about] doing [it] [is] [I] would [just] call [all] [my] relatives . 
A|48| A: It fluffs [up] [, and] [it's] [really] moist . 
B|49| B: We when [I] [was] , when [I] bought [my] last purebred retriever [I mean] [I] looked [all] over because [I] wanted one [that] [still] looked [like] [a] retriever [, you know _,] the_ [short] [to] [the] ground , stocky , golden [, uh ,] trainable , tractable , quiet animal [that] could hunt [and] [still be] [in] [the] [house] . 
A|50| A: [I] enjoyed having [a] lawn service [but] [now] [I] [have the] [time] [and I] [really] can't [, I] [really] [you know [,] don't] , want [to] [spend] [the] money _for it ._ 
B|51| B: [I know] 
A|52| A: Well , [there] [is so] many chances [for] appeal [, that] [it] 
B|53| B: [Yeah [,] I think [,] well [,] it's] [, it's] definitely [a] problem [, [and] [I] think] [it] could [get] worse . 
A|54| A: [Um [,] I] found [out] _too [,_ _that] , uh ,_ quite often [if I] see [something] on television [that I] want more in-depth [, uh ,] understanding [or] [, or] [get] , want [to] [know] more [about] [it [,] that] [the [,] the] newspaper [or] [, uh , I] read NEWSWEEK , [can] give [you] [a] better [and] more thorough coverage [of] [what] I've heard on T V [, but] [, uh [,] um [,] I] found [out] [that] also on , on T V [that [you] can] scan through [a whole [lot] of] different [things] on [C] N N [and [,] and] [like] [you] said [, [the] [,] the] news shows [that] [are] [, that] [are] happening [, [and] [you] can] read [some] more [about] [it] [if you] want [to] . [Um [,] I] found [out] , though _that [,_ or] [I] feel [that] [a lot of] [the] [stuff] on T V [and the] newspapers [is] negative . There's an awful [lot of] negative news [or] bad news [, or] [, or] bad news . [And] it'd [be] refreshing once [in a] while [to] hear [some] [good] news . 
B|55| B: [Right .] There has [to] [be] [, uh ,] [a] reuse [for it [.] I mean [,] that's] [why] [they] recycle [. The] one [I think] [is] [the] [most] interesting [is] with [the] recycled bottles [and] [all] [that , uh [,] the] industry seems [to] [be] doing with [the] recycled polymers . Uh , [everything] from [, uh ,] waste baskets [to] carpet [to] [the] [no] stick [, I mean] [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
A|56| A: Did [you] [really] ? [What] , black ones ? 
B|57| B: Exactly [, yeah [,] um ,] 
A|58| A: Uh-huh . 
B|59| B: [Oh [,] that's] [okay .] 
A|60| A: [Some] buildings [do] [, it] depends on [the] location [. The] area [I] [live] [in] right [now ,] [is ,] [is] _real good_ [as] [far] [as] crime rate [is] concerned [and] [we] [don't] [have] [anything] at [all] , [no] burglar alarms , [no] guards .
