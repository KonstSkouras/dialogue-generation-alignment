A|0| A: Okay _, _you_ get_ _it_ _from_ _people_ _then_ . 
B|1| B: _And_ _I'm_ _I'm_ [from] South Carolina . 
A|2| A: _It_ depends _on_ _, you_ can _really_ vary _it_ . 
B|3| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|4| A: _and , uh _,_ and_ _on_ huge doses _of_ antibiotics _, and_ _he_ _actually_ got over _it_ _with ,_ seven hundred dollars _in_ vet bills , 
B|5| B: _I think it_ must _have been_ terribly boring _to_ _go_ through , your life doing _just_ _one_ thing _for_ fifty years _or_ forty years . 
A|6| A: _That's_ _great ._ 
B|7| B: [and] _you know _,_ there's_ _a_ _big_ move , especially [in] _the_ industrial part _in Texas_ _right now_ [of] controlling _the_ C F C _that_ _the big_ manufacturing companies _are_ producing into _the_ air _they're_ having _to_ change _the type_ [of] products _they use_ 
A|8| A: _Right ._ 
B|9| B: [Right .] 
A|10| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|11| B: _Well ,_ preceding criminal record , according _to the_ judicial process _has_ nothing _to do_ [with] _the current_ crime . _But_ _when_ [it] comes _to [,_ uh ,] sentencing _for_ punishment , [of] course _, if_ _the_ person's _never_ _done_ _anything_ bad before , according _to the_ judicial system , [then] _they're_ going _to_ lean towards _a_ slightly more lenient side [, _and] the_ jury's supposed _to be_ notified [of] criminal records _when_ [it] comes _to_ sentencing _by_ jury . 
A|12| A: _I _,_ I'm_ [a] diver _and so_ _, that's_ _, that's_ _actually_ [been] another [of] _my_ favorite vacations _has been_ taking _little_ diving trips 
B|13| B: _So _,_ [I_ ,] _how_ _do_ [you] _feel_ _that_ [it] should _be_ applied ? 
A|14| A: Okay [, there's] [one] _, uh , I_ meant living [in Texas] _, where_ [you] _at_ ? 
B|15| B: _Well _,_ when_ [you] _when_ [you] _go_ _out_ into _the [,_ uh _,] when_ [you] _go_ _out_ into _the_ working world [it] _, it_ changes quickly . 
A|16| A: [I _think] the_ _drive_ [by] shootings [are] _getting_ [to be] _so_ common _, that's_ _really_ _a ,_ _something_ [you] got [to] protect yourself _from ._ 
B|17| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|18| A: _Oh_ . _Oh ,_ okay , _so_ , 
B|19| B: _but_ _I think it's_ Elijah 
A|20| A: [But] she _had [,_ _it] was_ interesting _, you _know _,_ I_ don't know_ [how] valid _it _is_ _,_ but_ she talked _about_ [that] [and] [how] _the , [the_ big] picnic table _was_ [the] symbolic communion _of _the_ people_ gathering together _, and ,_ um _, you know ,_ _about_ [the] bread [and the] ritual placement . Do [you] _have a _,_ _a_ certain_ way [that] _everything_ _is_ placed [out] _on the_ table _every_ , _every_ _year_ ? _Is_ _there_ _kind _of_ _a_ _,_ you know ,_ salads [go] first [and] things _like _that_ ?_ 
B|21| B: [Oh] [my] God , [how] _do_ _they_ _live_ ? 
A|22| A: whenever _we_ give arms [to] _people_ , _as_ _we_ _did_ [, and] _as_ _we_ sold arms [to ,] pardon _me_ , [to] Iraq [, when] _we_ wanted _them_ [to] fight Iran [, _and] then [,_ uh [,] _and] then_ [it] turn _around_ _and ,_ 
B|23| B: Um , 
A|24| A: _They_ pick _up_ _everything_ . 
B|25| B: [It] _is ._ [It] [really] _is ._ 
A|26| A: My word . 
B|27| B: _Yes _,_ what_ [a] coincidence . 
A|28| A: [Well _,] uh , the_ police force _, for_ [one] _, I think_ [they] _could [, uh_ ,] definitely add [to the] police force [and [the] type] equipment _that [they_ use] _. Uh _,_ it's ,_ oh , [right now] [I think] _, we are_ _about_ thirty thousand _people_ [and] [there's] only eight officers [that] patrol [for] thirty _, for_ [that] amount [of] _people_ _which_ [is] _not_ _very_ many . 
B|29| B: _Yeah [,_ it's] [like that] _good_ [for] us _just_ _because_ [my] uncle [and] [my] [, and] [my] mom switch off [like] [we] [have] _her_ [for] three months [and then] [he] [has] _her_ [for] three months . 
A|30| A: [I] [like that] _. And_ _then [,_ uh ,] [my] husband _, he_ _just [,_ uh ,] subscribed _to a_ wood _, he_ [just] started [a] woodwork _so_ [he] [just] sent _away_ _to get_ _some_ woodworking books . 
B|31| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|32| A: Okay , [have] [you] participated [in] [anything] [like _that] ?_ 
B|33| B: [I [,] uh , _I] [I_ [,] I don't] [think the] judge should [just] _make_ [the] decision alone . 
A|34| A: [Yeah .] _That's_ _true ._ 
B|35| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: Sure . 
B|37| B: Always _want to_ _go to_ Canada Canada [to] Banff _or_ somewhere [like that] 
A|38| A: [and] _some_ [of] _those_ _people_ _, they_ [don't] deserve [to be] let loose . 
B|39| B: They're [in] Missouri _and _I_ [could_ [,] [I] [,] I] [know , I] [know] stories [for] _sure_ [that they] [just [,] they] [, they] [just _,] well [,_ they] can't take [the] proper care [of] [them] . Most [of] [them] . 
A|40| A: [Yes _,] it is _._ I_ am [, uh _,] _like_ a_ Catholic [and _the] people that_ [go to] [my] Church _, you know_ Catholics dress _very_ casual _a lot _of_ the_ times _. People_ [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever _, but_ yet [the] way _I was_ raised [, I] am [a] converted Catholic _, the_ way _I was_ raised [, _I] was_ raised [a] Baptist [and] [like] _as_ [a] youngster [I] [use] [to] _always_ dress _up_ _all the_ _time_ _. _I_ guess_ [that] [has] changed also . 
B|41| B: Like last Saturday [we] went , [had] [some] errands [to] run [and so] [we] took [the] kids [and [,] and] went [by] [the] Farmers Market _down_ [in] _, in_ , _down_ [there] [in] Garland . 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: _Yeah ,_ escape . [But] [it's] beautiful [, it's [,] you know [,] it's] Eastern Hardwood [, uh ,] forest , [there] [are] [a lot of] pine trees [, but] [it's] mostly oaks [and] . 
A|44| A: Such _that [,_ you know ,] _lots of_ _people_ got involved [that] way . 
B|45| B: On [my] driveway _, I guess_ [, that's] _what_ [they] _do_ [and then [,] _I] had to_ wheel barrow [it] [in] . 
A|46| A: [Yeah _,] [I think_ it] [could] affect [the] outcome [, you know ,] [could] [make] [it] unfair . 
B|47| B: [That's] amazing _, well ,_ what's [the] difference [there] , _do_ [you know] ? 
A|48| A: _And I_ _would_ _not_ [have been] fun trying [to] retrieve [her] _, _but ,_ uh _,_ this_ _dog_ , Dennis jumped _in and_ got _this_ look _on_ _his_ face [like] [what] [do] [I] [do] [now] , _as_ he's floating [down] [the] river [then] finally discovered [that] [he] [could] swim _and , uh _,_ actually_ paddled _up_ against [the current] _and , uh ,_ made [it] back [to the] shore [and] climbed _up_ [and then _,] he , he_ jumped [in] _again [,_ and] _he was_ swimming [for] _quite a bit_ _, all_ afternoon . He loved [it] . 
B|49| B: [Uh [,] actually] [one] thing [we] [have] _done_ [quite a bit] through [the] holidays , [just] _because_ [it's] [a ,] real easy , [is] [just] baked potato dinners . 
A|50| A: _And I_ _would_ [never] [do] [it] _. [I_ I] love _this_ country _too_ much [, and] [that] symbol means [a lot] [to] _me_ . 
B|51| B: Some baby-sitting groups , [again [,] I] [know] [it] sounds [like a] rationalization [, but] [I] [really] [do] [think] sometimes [they] [very] early [on] [are] [around] [lots of] _other_ children [and] [they] [, they] learn [to] share . [They] learn [not] necessarily [to be] [the] center [of] attention [but] [that] [at] _the same_ [time] [we] [have] [to be] _sure_ [they] [are] secure . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: _But [,_ uh [,] we] [had [,] uh [,] you know [,] all] these [, we] [have] [all] these [, uh ,] somebody _said_ [, you know ,] you're either [a] stranger _or a_ fool [to] try [to] predict [Texas] weather [, but] . [Well ,] [always] [, they] were saying [it was] going [to be] [the] hottest summer ever , 
A|54| A: [Yeah _,] the_ times [are] different _, yeah ._ 
B|55| B: _I have_ [not] read [that ,] _although _,_ I have_ heard [it is] pretty _good_ . 
A|56| A: [Yeah .] 
B|57| B: _But [,_ uh [,] you] [think] you'd buy [, uh _,] an_ American car _or a_ European _or_ Japanese ? 
A|58| A: _is that_ suppose [to be] . 
B|59| B: Get rid [of] [them] . Exactly [. [I] [,] I] [really] [, [I] [,] I think] [that] [that's] [the] whole key here . This plea bargaining baloney [, where] [, uh [,] you know [,] they] plead [to a] lesser crime , _or_ [, uh [,] they] plead guilty [in] , _or_ [, you know ,] tell [about] someone _else_ [and] [they] [, they] [get] less [time] , 
A|60| A: [it's] [you know ,] um _, _but [,_ uh [,_ I] don't] [, what] [else] [about] housing except [it's [,] uh [,] well ,] Pittsburgh's housing economy [, [I think] it's] holding [it's] own . 
B|61| B: [Oh ,] _good_ . 
A|62| A: [Right .] [That's] 
B|63| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
A|64| A: [Well ,] _basically_ _, yeah_ [I had [to] _do] _,_ [that_ _,] uh , [the_ same] [, uh _,] for_ [about] _every_ quarter _of the_ _year_ _. I mean_ [uh ,] [because] _I was_ _in [a_ [,] _in] a_ position [of] management [I had] responsibilities over _people [that_ [,] uh , I] needed [to] [make] [my] schedule [, uh ,] [so] _that if_ _I was_ [not] [there] [I] _would_ [have] coverage [by] [some] [other] management personnel , 
B|65| B: She'll [be] two [in] July . 
A|66| A: Was _it a_ boy [or a] girl ? 
B|67| B: [It] [is] [great .] 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [I think] [those] should [be] uninsurable _. I think_ [those] should [have] [to be] paid [by] [the] corporation itself _that , that_ [did] [the] damage . 
A|70| A: [Oh _,] _yeah_ [,_ all] [that] hoedown _stuff_ . 
B|71| B: _So_ [we] _said_ [the] next [time] [around] we'd [get] [something] [little] [that if] [something] happened [, it] [would] [be] easier [to] carry . 
A|72| A: [Well [,] I guess] [I could] [use] [a] card _too [._ I] [live] [, uh ,] [very] near [, uh ,] [very] close [to the] Firewheel Golf Course . 
B|73| B: [but] [I'm] applying [for] , What ? [Yeah [,] it is .] 
A|74| A: He [just] [said] burn [it] . 
B|75| B: [It] _had been_ [, you know ,] [of] course [, a] farm . 
A|76| A: _You_ [know [,] that's] [, that's] totally [out] . 
B|77| B: [Yeah .] He's [about] [a] [year] [and] [a] half younger . 
A|78| A: [But ,] um [, I have] , um [, [that] , that] [was] [the] majority [of] [my] writing [although ,] um [, I have] also [done] oh , free lance magazine writing [and] [some] educational writing _. And_ , um _, for a_ while [I _had] a ,_ um _, uh , a_ partnership [with] [a [,] in] [an] advertising agency [with] another woman who [is] [a [,] an] artist . [So] [I] [did] [some] advertising [and] P R _but ,_ 
B|79| B: Statistically [, that's] [true .] 
A|80| A: [I think] [you] [do] . _You_ [feel] [very] [good] after [you] exercise [. [I think] it's] worth making [the] [time] [for] yourself . 
B|81| B: Um . 
A|82| A: A [, a] bedroom [for] [my] mother _, and , uh ,_ 
B|83| B: [so] . 
A|84| A: He _didn't_ talk [about] cleaning [it] _up_ [or] [anything] [like that] . [So] [it's] [not] [very] practical 
B|85| B: [You] pay gasoline taxes [every] [time] [you] pump [something] into your , your tank . 
A|86| A: [Right .] 
B|87| B: [Is] [it a] single story ? 
A|88| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|89| B: [And [I] think] [that] [would] [be] wonderful [too .] 
A|90| A: Than [we] [think] . Sure . Sure . 
B|91| B: [I'm] sorry [, we are] [not] [getting] rid [of the] cats . 
A|92| A: Okay , Jerry [, I guess] tonight's topic [is] [about] recycling . 
B|93| B: No . 
A|94| A: [And] _he was_ [the] only [one] left [and] _his_ mother [had been] killed _coming_ back across [the] road [to] [make] [sure] she'd gotten [all] [her] kittens . 
B|95| B: [And] [this] [is] before [I was] born . 
A|96| A: Snow , 
B|97| B: [and] [it's ,] 
A|98| A: [And] [, uh ,] [so] [when] [I] met [my] husband _, he was_ watching football [and I] figured [out] [that] [I] couldn't see him [all] weekend [. I] couldn't see him until [like] Tuesday [because] MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL [, if] _I didn't_ _, like_ football . [So ,] 
B|99| B: [a] new carrier [was] [coming] [in [and] [, uh ,] [the] [,] uh ,] attendant [, uh ,] support vessels . [Well [,] that's] _no_ longer [, the] case . 
A|100| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: Autocrossing [is [,] what] [kind of] track [is [that] ?] 
A|104| A: [So ,] [so] [I guess] our vote [is] [no] 
B|105| B: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
A|106| A: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ [Yeah .] 
B|107| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|108| A: [And] [you] [don't] [want to] ? 
B|109| B: [some] [, I don't] even [, I] recognize [the , the] melodies [, and] whatnot [, but] [I didn't] recognize [the] name . 
A|110| A: Huh . 
B|111| B: [Uh [,] well [,] uh [,] yeah .] We 've spend [a] spend [a] [did] spend [a lot of] [time] [, uh [,] it] [really] helped [when] [the [,] uh ,] older [one] [was] old enough [to get] [his] license [and] [could , uh] [drive] [around] [by] himself [although] [that] brought [in a] whole [other] set [of] problems . 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [They] , [on] [I think [it] was] Romain Drive [or] Romain Street [or] [something] , [there] [in] Los Angeles [, they] used [to] [have a ,] [or] [, I guess] [they] still [do [,] uh ,] [had a [,] uh [,] uh ,] [big] warehouse [kind of] thing , [which] [had] offices [and] [it was] sort [of] nondescript [for [a] [,] uh [,] you know [,] for] [the] size [of the] company [which] , inside [was] [basically] [a] store house [of a] bunch [of] [stuff] [he] collected [, he [, he] was] [, uh , a] [great] collector [of] [everything] [, he [, he] , he] [did] [not] [, he] [did] [not] throw [anything] [away] [and , uh ,] supposedly [this] guy [had ,] [had been] breaking [there] [for] [he was] [a [,] like] [, you know ,] burglar , [had been] breaking [there] awhile [and , uh ,] [And] [had] ended [up] , 
A|114| A: [But] [I] 
B|115| B: [It] [was] gorgeous . [It] [was] [just] gorgeous [. I mean] [just] gorgeous . Um [, and] [they] both [, you know ,] both [the] half breed [and the] pure breed [had] [the [,] uh [,] what] [I] consider [the , [the] , the] perfect disposition . [But] [you know] [what] [, you know] [what] scares [me] [about] Golden Retrievers ? Since they've become [so] popular [you get] [what] [I] call backyard breeders . Which [is] probably [where] yours came [from [.] People] [that] [don't know] [what] _they're_ doing [, and] [they] breed [them] [, you know [,] for [a] certain] characteristic [. And] [in] [the] retrievers [it] happens [to be] [they] [like] [them] [big] [, for] somehow [big] [is] perceived [as] [the] better [. And] [when] [you] start doing [that] [you] [really] tamper [with [,] you know [,] [the] [,] [all] [the] , the] years [of] [, uh ,] culling litters [and [,] and , uh [,] you] tamper [with] [what] [the] [dog] innately [is .] 
A|116| A: [And] [they] [have] [very] [good] food over [there] . 
B|117| B: Exactly _. Uh-huh [._ Uh [,] I don't know] [. [I] [,] uh [,] you] [, you] rarely hear [, you] hear , [of] course [there's] cases [where] someone [has been] put [in] [, in] [, in] [, uh ,] prison [, uh ,] falsely accused [but , uh ,] more than likely [the people that] [are] [on [the] , the] jury [know] [what] _they're_ doing [. Uh [,] [I] mean] [you] , 
A|118| A: [yeah [.] Uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [yeah [,] yeah] [it] [, it] [really] [is [,] uh [,] but ,] gee [, this] [is ,] [of] [all the] topics [I have] [had [,] I'm] doing [this] thing [, this] [is] [kind [of] the] strangest [one] . 
A|120| A: That will [be] neat [, yeah .] Absolutely , [they're] expensive . 
B|121| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [Well] maybe [something] will open [up] [for] [you] . 
B|123| B: More luxury [. Uh-huh] , uh-huh .
