B|19| B: _And _, I_ mean_ _, it_ sounds horrible . It [, I] hear myself saying [this] _, and [,_ [but] [,] _I] ,_ _don't know_ _what_ _else [to do_ with] _some of_ [these] _people_ , [that] _are_ , 
A|20| A: Course [, _and] _I_ like_ sugar , _too _,_ that's_ [that's] [a] problem , 
B|21| B: _Really_ ? 
A|22| A: _But_ [there] wasn't [a] [, [it] was] strange [, [it] was] [kind of] sad _, there_ wasn't ever [a] language problem [there] [, because] everyone [in] Germany knew English [and] everyone [in] Switzerland , knew English . 
B|23| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|24| A: Who wrote _that ?_ 
B|25| B: Then _I think_ [it] makes [a] _big_ difference . 
A|26| A: [Yeah .] 
B|27| B: [and they] charge _me_ [all these] others [, _and] it's_ [just] [too] expensive . 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [And] _one of the_ Congressmen _has_ , _has_ written [in the] last _three_ [years] [about] [a] thousand _bad_ checks . 
A|30| A: Okay . Hey , thanks [so] _much_ _for the_ conversation . 
B|31| B: _I've_ never _actually_ , never _actually_ played [it _.] But_ , 
A|32| A: [And] [the] _side_ [that's] _on [the_ _, uh ,] _the_ other_ _side_ [is] [about] six feet high . 
B|33| B: [and _,] um [,_ I] _killed_ [that] _one_ within [a] _very_ short amount [of] [time] . 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: _So_ you're [all] _back _to_ the_ safety catches [and the] whole nine yards _or_ either watching [them] every minute .

B|37| B: [Yeah [,] uh ,] [of] course [, [I] like] gadgets [and _,] and , uh ,_ fun _things _,_ [on_ the] cars , which _are_ [all] [the _things] ,_ course [, the] 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: _Uh ,_ cause _I've_ [been] [at] _places_ which offer [a lot of] support [and] others [that] [don't] offer any [and] _some_ _that ,_ _sometimes_ [that's] coincided [with] [a place] [that] offers _more_ vacation [time] though , 
A|40| A: _Oh_ . 
B|41| B: _Oh ,_ okay . 
A|42| A: [And] [in] _talking [to_ the] [people] [from] France [he] _said_ [, you know ,] [he] says , [one of [the] things] [that] [really] concerns [me] [is] your government [is not] telling [you] _enough_ [about] how [it] [and] _frightening_ [this] epidemic [is .] [And] _they're_ letting [, the] information [out] slowly [about] how [, you know ,] how [big] _it [is_ .] 
B|43| B: [Um .] 
A|44| A: [and] _they're_ _into_ sports 
B|45| B: Hi . 
A|46| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|47| B: _Uh [,_ _we] have_ fifty acres . 
A|48| A: No , huh-uh [. Uh [,] I think] _they're_ [interesting .] 
B|49| B: therefore [, the] individual , every [time] [they [have] a] service call , [if] [they have] an old unit [that's] still using [this] twenty-two freon _or_ whatever [it is] [, it] costs [them] _three_ times _as_ [much] _to get_ [it] fixed 
A|50| A: [Yeah .] 
B|51| B: _Right_ _. Yeah ._ 
A|52| A: _Right ,_ [it's] [a little] [more] understandable under [the] circumstances [, [I] guess] . 
B|53| B: [Oh] [really] ? 
A|54| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ [So] _is it_ [, uh ,] [are] [we] doing lethal injection _now_ ? 
B|55| B: What [was] [that ?] 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh _.] Well [,_ I] bet [you] , [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [But] [I] _had_ [, uh ,] _had a_ Ford Escort [that] absolutely needed taps _the day_ [we] [got] [it .] 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: Or [they] [on] _their_ within [the] own [uh] society [, it] [can] vary . 
A|60| A: [And] we're finding [that] crime _is going_ [up] [very] quickly [and] [has] become [a] major problem [, uh ,] _even_ [a] [more] major problem [. Uh ,] [in] Dallas , [some [of] the] major problems [, uh ,] drugs seems [to] be related [to] quite [a] [bit] [of the] crime [we have] _now_ . There [is] [a lot of] theft [, a lot of] assault dealing _with , uh ,_ [people] trying [to get] money [for] drugs . 
B|61| B: Of course . 
A|62| A: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
B|63| B: [and [it] is] _good ._

B|65| B: [So] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
A|66| A: _Right _,_ that's_ critical [, because] _she's in_ need [of] [it] [so] often . 
B|67| B: [but _,] um [,_ he's] [not] old [enough] yet [to get] [into] [the] band yet . 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right [,] uh ,] yeah [, we] [can] [get] [, uh ,] yeah , [if] [we] [get] _someone_ [in] [there] _like _that_ ,_ then [, you know [,] they] could make [all] _sorts of_ changes [that] [they] were [, you know ,] _had_ [enough] pull . 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] As _far_ _as_ yeah , getting doctors [and] _all that_ [stuff ,] yeah . 
A|72| A: They [had] [one] [, uh [,] on] [that] [kind _of] ,_ type [of] _thing_ [and] how children [can] , [can] [do] _that and_ how [to] save water _when_ [you] brush your teeth [in] water [and it's] [really] caught [on] [and] [he's] only _four_ [and] [he's] [really] caught _on ._ 
B|73| B: Just _started_ shooting [people] [, because] [they] botched [the] [first] job 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [Well] [it was] [nice talking to you] [too [,] I] enjoyed [it .] 
A|76| A: I'd be [, I mean] I'd be tried by [a] jury [of] [you know ,] [people] who [had] nothing [else to do] [and] weren't [very] knowledgeable [about] certain [sorts of] [things [,] and [, uh _,] I] don't [know_ ,] 
B|77| B: [And] [it's] [like] [I] [said] [at] [our] expense . 
A|78| A: Wow [. Yeah .] 
B|79| B: [and] [that] _may_ impact [it] _as_ [well] . 
A|80| A: _so I_ always [just] [had a] mother . [So] [I] always thought _, when _I_ have_ kids [, you know [,] I] [really] want [to] be involved [with] [them] . 
B|81| B: [Well ,] [for] [some] [things] . 
A|82| A: [Yeah .] 
B|83| B: [and] then [it was] [all] year [, there] [was] [just] copperheads everywhere . 
A|84| A: _Right , right_ , obstinate , obstinate . 
B|85| B: How [are] [they] built ? 
A|86| A: [he's] [been] doing real [good _.] I'm_ pretty impressed [with] him [so] [far] . 
B|87| B: [Yeah .] 
A|88| A: [he's] _gone_ [three] weeks _right_ _now_ [and] [that's] _, that's_ mild compare [to the] [big] ones , 
B|89| B: [Yeah [,] and [,] and] also _, um _,_ the [,_ _the] thing_ [I don't] [like] [about] [a lot of] [these] court trials [and] [a lot of] [these] appeals [is] [that] [it's] [not] based [on] _what_ [is] [true] [and] _what_ [is] false [but] rather [it's] [on the] rules [of] evidence _, what_ [can] [I] hide [and] _what_ [do] [I [have] [to] tell] . 
A|90| A: [Oh ,] _now_ _my_ husband _and I [,_ we] [go] [different] [places] [. But] [our] [but] _when_ [we] [go] [with] [our] children [we] usually [kind of] stay close . 
B|91| B: [so I] called [four] _or_ five [dog] trainers [because] [I don't] [like] [the] [little] dogs . 
A|92| A: [So] _, my_ husband _and I_ _love_ [to] [go] [to the] musicals _when_ [they] come [into] [town] [into] Dallas . 
B|93| B: [Right , [right] .] 
A|94| A: Are [you] [a] T [I] [or] , 
B|95| B: [Yeah [.] I'm] anxious [some] _day_ [to have] [one] _here ._ 
A|96| A: [the] same _I don't know_ [I guess] [I] [get] [I] [get] [uh] [all] mixed [up] inside . _when ,_ [Yeah] 
B|97| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: _with ,_ [someone] [is] calling [for] [someone] [else to] be [killed] [, you know] . Is [really kind of] [bad] 
B|99| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] 
B|101| B: _you just_ [kind of] [have to] read [and] understand _what_ [is going] [on .] 
A|102| A: [And] [I] wrote [that] down [on] _my_ questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that ,] 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh _.] I_ agree [with] _that ._ 
A|104| A: [Yeah .] 
B|105| B: [Yeah [,] [I] like] [a lot] , [like] [, [I] like] [, uh ,] [is it] [the] New Age music , [like] [with , uh [,] uh _, the] [, I_ don't know] [if] you've heard Neurotic Collection . 
A|106| A: [And , [I] guess] _even_ [back to] Kennedy , _as a matter of fact_ [, [I] guess] Kennedy [may] be [the] [one] [that] [actually] [started] [the thing] , [or] [was [,] you know ,] [really] interested [in] [things] [like [that] .] 
B|107| B: [Oh ,] boy [, that's] frustrating . 
A|108| A: Now [, um ,] 
B|109| B: _I've_ [been] [to] Telluride which [is] [on the] west [side] [and , uh ,] Copper , 
A|110| A: [Really] [, that's] great _. Well _,_ my_ boys [are] [at] [the] _point_ where [they] scare [their] mommy [to] death .

A|120| A: Yes , [I've] seen those . They're cute . 
B|121| B: [and it's] [just] [different] [things] _you [have_ to] [talk] [to] [them] [about] [now] [that] [you] would never [even] [have] dreamt [to [have] to] say [anything] [about] . 
A|122| A: [Oh] . Trying [to] figure [out] [what] [all that] [was] [about] , huh ? 
B|123| B: [Oh [,] on] [one] hand [I] [see] [that and] [on [the] other] hand [, uh [,] my] older sister remembers [when [,] uh ,] [at] [one] [point] [they] were taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [I guess] , [had a] half-life [of ,] oh , five [years] [if] [they] sit empty [on] dry land . 
A|124| A: [Right ,] exactly [. _I] , I don't_ [, the [, I] think] almost [the] only way [that] drug testing [can] be done fairly [is] [if] [it's] across [the] board [from] [, from] [the] janitors [to the] executive management . 
B|125| B: [Uh [,] well ,] yeah [, I] am [as a matter of fact] [. Well ,] [actually] [I'm looking for] [another] car [, [but] [,] uh [,] uh ,] new , probably [not] .

B|127| B: Then she [was] starting [to get] [, uh [,] you know ,] lose memory _sometimes_ [and ,] which [is] [kind of] [frightening] [when] [she's [in] the] car . 
A|128| A: You [know [,] [you] [just] , you] [did] [not] [see] [, I] [did] [not] [see] anybody [in] [my] classrooms [, when I was] [going] [to] school , act [up] [the] way [that] kids [do] [these] days [in the] classroom . 
B|129| B: [and [I ,] I don't] [think] I'll [do it] again 
A|130| A: Do [you] [go] [back] ? 
B|131| B: [Yeah ,] yeah .
