B|11| B: _So_ [you] put [the] milk [in the] cornstarch ? 
A|12| A: Oh _really_ ? 
B|13| B: That's [really] _interesting ,_ _I've_ _never_ heard [of] anybody making their _own_ pudding _before_ [that's really] neat . 
A|14| A: _but_ _it_ seems [like] here _, I_ _would_ [like] _it_ [to] rain [and] _then_ _be_ _over_ _, and_ _then_ _not_ rain _for a_ while _. It_ seems [like] when _it_ gets stuck [in] [a] rain pattern , [that's] _all_ _it_ _does_ .

B|19| B: bye . 
A|20| A: [Yeah .] [And] [the] time [that] _my_ _, we_ spent [with] our Dad _was_ , _he_ owned _his_ [own] business _so_ _we_ worked [with] him most _of the_ time _. So_ [that's] how _we_ spent most _of the_ time [with] him . 
B|21| B: [Yeah .] 
A|22| A: [Yeah .] 
B|23| B: [and] [my] husband _, then_ fianc3e , [was] [to] keep [my] cat [, and] [he] let [her] _out [,_ and] [my] house [was] loaded [with] fleas _, I mean [,_ you] walked [in] [and] your legs _were_ [just] black .

A|30| A: Wow Wow , [that's] , 
B|31| B: [Right .] 
A|32| A: _Yeah [,_ _I] think_ something [like] [the] Peace Corps [is] [a] [bit] harsh . 
B|33| B: [I] _don't_ [know] 
A|34| A: [and] [I] [was] thinking how _many_ _other people_ 
B|35| B: [So] _, I mean ,_ [his] appeal [was] denied [and] _two days_ later [he] got [out] [of] jail For cocaine possession . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|38| A: Um _, you know _,_ _I'm_ not_ sure _, _I'm_ not_ positive [, I] didn't [, I] didn't [really] _think_ _about_ _that ._ [I] [just] remember trying [to] figure [out] [where you] could [get] [that] [was] real close [to] [the] [good] section _but_ [in the] [little bit] cheaper _. But_ , _not_ [that] I'll [ever] _go ._ [I] hadn't _been_ _to a_ Cowboys game , time , last time [I] went [to] [the] Cowboys game [was] during [that] , um , N F L strike , or _the ,_ when [they] [had] [the] scab team , teams [in] [there] [, and] [it] [was] _the , uh ,_ Dallas [and] Washington Redskins game . [And I] went [because] [my] dad [can] usually [get] [a] hold [of] _some_ free tickets , [because] _a lot of_ those doctors [have] season tickets [, _and] _they_ ,_ um _, if_ _they're_ _not going to_ use them they'll give them [to] somebody else _. So_ [my] dad [, I] went [with] [my] dad _to a_ game [that] one time _. But_ [that] wasn't [a] real _, you know ,_ [it] [was] , [it] [was] [the] scab teams , [it] [was] _kind of_ _, you know ,_ [it] [was] _kind of_ _different_ [, I] guess . [And] [before] [that] [it's] _been_ quite [a] few years . [I've] _been_ wanting [to] _go to a_ game [, I] [just] [never] , [never] [have] gotten around [to] [it] _. So_ maybe [this] year . 
B|39| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|40| A: [that's] [the] problem [I have] [with] _it ,_ [in] Texas [they] _think it's_ [and] _all_ [and] _be_ _all_ [, they] _think_ [that] _if_ [they] electrocute or slip , or _do_ something , or gas somebody [, uh ,] [that] _they're_ _not going to_ _have the_ _crimes_ [that] [they] _do_ [have] [and] [we] _happen_ [to] _live_ [in] Dallas which [is] extremely _crime_ , ridden , 
B|41| B: [Well [,] we] [have] several children [that] _are_ [in] sports [, and so] [it] always makes their games [be] postponed forever [and] [ever] [and] [ever] _on_ , _on_ [, and] _on_ . 
A|42| A: [Yeah [.] [Well ,] I] guess _too_ _if_ [I] thought [that] [this] _would_ help [really] [and] truly _do_ away [with] [the] drug problem [, then] [that] _would be_ one [thing _.] But_ _I _think_ it's_ _too_ minor [and] _too_ _, you know ,_ 
B|43| B: [Yeah ,] _there's_ [just] [too] [many] crazy [people] [out] [there] _these_ _days_ . 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] 
B|45| B: [and] [they're] , they've [been] doing [a lot of] [that] [in the] area . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh _.] It_ sure [is] . The _, you know ,_ as far as [, _I] think_ [there] [was] something [with] [the] government official [that] went [on] conferences [for] [two days] [and] actually _, uh , the_ conferences [were] nothing _but , uh _,_ you know ,_ [they're] getting paid [for this] [, and] [it] [was] something more than [just] [the] conferences . They [were] using [it] as eating [out [,] uh ,] when [you] _think_ _about_ [people] [, uh ,] taking vacations [these] big government officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|47| B: [I'm not] _saying_ [they're] [all] [bad] [, but] [I think] [people] who _are_ guilty [of] [really] serious heinous [crimes] , [do] [not] deserve [to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] their lives . 
A|48| A: [and _,] you know [,_ you] _can't_ [get] [a] Golden Retriever near water without [it] jumping [in] . 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [I] imagine . They usually [are] after something [like] [that] happens [to] them _. It_ seems [to] mellow them or something . 
B|51| B: Huh . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: [Yeah ,] right . [Right [.] But] still [there] [are] , [there] [are] [other people] [there] doing [the ,] doing [the] same [thing .] 
A|54| A: [But] . That [is] [a] very [good] point . [I] am [from] West Virginia [so] [I] understand [what] [you] [are] [saying] [there] 
B|55| B: [And] [, you know ,] [people] say [, you know [,] it's] expensive [to] [think it's] college [, but [,] if] [, if] everybody [would [be] a] [little bit] responsible [, you know [,] it's] _like ,_ [what] [does] [it ,] [what] [does] [it] cost [. It] costs five _hundred_ dollars [a] semester suppose . Now _they [go_ to a] state college [and they] [live] _at_ _home_ [you know ,] 
A|56| A: To , [to] compensate [for] _some of the_ benefits . 
B|57| B: [Uh [,] I] certainly [can't] argue [with] [that .] Definitely [does] need [some] improvements . [Uh [,] and] [the] lawyers [can] throw [people] [out] [for] no reason whatsoever [just] [because] [they] want [to] . 
A|58| A: What _about_ fast foods ? Do [you] [have] [a] preference _if you_ [were] _going to_ , eat [a] fast food ? 
B|59| B: Hi , fine [, I'm] Nancy . How [are] [you] ? 
A|60| A: [It] , [it] sounds [like [,] I mean ,] [from] [the] _way_ [you] described [it] [a] [home] [like] [that] here [would be] [at] least [two] [hundred] [and] fifty thousand 
B|61| B: [Yeah ,] pizzas [and] spaghettis [and] lasagnas [and] [that] [kind of] stuff . 
A|62| A: Because [all] [the] models [of] teaching English [are] based [on] teaching English [to] Spanish speakers or [to] [other] European language speakers . [And] [people] [don't] realize how _different_ _some of the_ languages [they] speak [are .] 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [so] [I've] [been] librarian [all] [this] week , which has [been] real [interesting [,] and] [I'm] enjoying [it] . [I'm] around [my] kids 
B|65| B: You're kidding ! No kidding ! [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: There's [a lot of] child care available [, but] invariably [there's] waiting lists . 
B|67| B: This [is] what's [going to] [happen] . 
A|68| A: [Yeah ,] um , something [I] [do] [is] [a] fruit , [is] , I'll [get ,] um , make chocolate sauce [and] dip strawberries [and] bananas [in] them [. [Yeah] [,] [I] have] [two] nieces [and _they] , they_ [they go] melt [some] chocolate chips , Go buy me [some] strawberries . 
B|69| B: [I mean ,] pretty much [a lot of] [people] [would] [know] [about] [it [,] you [know ,] [and] [,] and] [know] [some of the] [different] things [about] [it] [but , uh [,] [they] , they] might weed [you] [out] [some] [other] [way] . [You know [,] [if] you] [, [if] you] [don't] _believe_ , [like] [if] _this was a_ capital [crime] [and [,] and] [you] [don't] _believe_ [in] [if you] [don't] _believe_ [in] death penalty [, you're] [not going [to] be] picked [at] [all] [. So] [but ,] 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|71| B: [You] [mean] [they] [don't] [have [the] [, uh ,] the] smog alerts ? 
A|72| A: [Uh ,] she enjoys mowing . [I] [can't] [believe] [it] . 
B|73| B: [Yeah] There [you] [go .] 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: It's [really] [kind of] curious [to] watch [this] [thing] occur . 
A|76| A: [I] [, yeah [,] [I] think] [, [I] think] [this was] , [this was a] very [interesting] topic [uh ,] [because] [it's] something [that] [, you know [,] we] [don't] talk [about] [in] [this] country probably enough . 
B|77| B: Like aluminum cans ? 
A|78| A: [And] [they] [would] [not] [have the] quality ,
