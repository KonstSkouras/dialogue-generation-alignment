A|8| A: _Uh , _and_ , uh ,_ 
B|9| B: [Uh-huh]

B|19| B: [Yeah ,] it'll [be] _hard to_ _get_ _people_ [to] give _up_ their mobility . 
A|20| A: _Yes_ . 
B|21| B: Did [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
A|22| A: _Uh ,_ _now_ color preferences [, I] think [I] would opt [to] go _with_ [a] bronze . Which [is] _probably_ closest [to] gold [that] [you] _can get_ 
B|23| B: [Uh [,] I] work for Georgia Tech . [Yes] sir _. I_ work for [the] research facility . [Uh , and] _it's_ , _it's_ _kind of_ small [in] [a] sense _but_ _it_ , _it_ does [have] , _about_ [, uh [,] _I] guess_ , two thousand civil employees . 
A|24| A: [and , uh ,] _I've_ seen [, uh ,] [a] lot [of] [people] [get] convicted , sentenced [, and] then [just] nothing happens , [just] endless , endless , endless appeals .

A|26| A: [Well] no , actually _he_ [had] no trouble [at] all . He [first] jumped [in] [and [I] ,] he's , he's [just] [about a year] [old] himself [and] never [had] really [, I] don't think he'd swum before . 
B|27| B: On your friends , that's _true_ , that's _true ._ [Well] , we [have] [so] many unexpected things come _up_ [so] often _it_ seems [with] , we both [have] older cars [and] something will come _up_ [and] wind _up_ having [to] spend [a] thousand dollars [, you know ,] on [the] car [in] two months or something , 
A|28| A: So [it's] [a] lot [of] fun [. I] worked [up] [there] last summer [, so] [I guess] [it] [was] [kind of] [like] [a] vacation _the ,_ whole summer long 
B|29| B: [I] mean [, you] can't guarantee [that] they wouldn't escape from prison [and] [do] [it] again . 
A|30| A: All _the ,_ yeah . [Uh-huh .] That's [true .] 
B|31| B: [Yeah [.] I] [know] [the] rain bring out [the] snakes or used [to] bring _them_ out [in the] Ozarks , 
A|32| A: No . 
B|33| B: [Yeah ,] [it's] , [it's] stopped around here [at] ten [and] [it] [goes] into night programs , [at] [that] point [which] _could_ [be] [one] [of] [, you know ,] many different night programs _but_ [it] [goes] into night programs . 
A|34| A: My word isn't [that] sorry . That's sorry . 
B|35| B: The , [the cat] almost died [, and] _but_ [he] turned out [to] [be] such [a] wonderful [cat] , oh [he] loves life [now] . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] Okay 
B|37| B: [Yeah .] You [can get] [the ,] they [have] some nice camping grounds [you know [,] that] [have] [the] water piped out 
A|38| A: [I] said [that [,] I] [could] believe [in] [it] [in] certain instances _, but_ [I] would [be] , I'd find [it] [hard to] levy [that] against [somebody] . 
B|39| B: [Well] , we try [to] stay away from those things [which] might [have] [, uh ,] salmonella [in] _them ._ 
A|40| A: They don't go [and] [see] [them .] That's right . 
B|41| B: [I] listen [to] [the] radio [, uh ,] [probably] five or six hours [a] week [, but] almost inevitably [to] [a] station [that] [is] [a] classical [, uh ,] station here , for music purposes .
