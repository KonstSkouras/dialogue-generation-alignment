B|49| B: _I , I_ [would] consider [it] [for] sexual abuse [of] [children ,] [on] [going] . You [know ,] [not] [one] instance [, but] perpetual abusers [of] [children] . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: _I've_ [had] four companies [actually] stop mailing _me_ stuff . 
A|52| A: Huh . [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: [Yeah .] 
A|54| A: _about , uh [,_ like] [you] [say ,] using _them_ , our interest _there_ [is , you know [,] what] profit _we_ _could_ make off [of] any [kind of] relationship _with_ _them_ , 
B|55| B: [Yeah .] 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [Right] [, right] . 
A|58| A: _Well ,_ [that] [is] interesting . [Right .] 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh .] Ooh . [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [my] mother [got] [a] _piano_ [and , uh ,] vowed [that] someone _in _the_ family_ [was] [going] [to] learn , [so] _we_ all [had] [to] take lessons [, _and] [I_ was] [the] [one] [that] [did] [the] least poorly , [so] she gave [it] [to] [me] _. [And_ it's] sitting here mostly taking _up_ space [, but] [sometimes] [it] makes [you] _feel_ good [to] sit down [and] _play_ [it .] [It] [is] real relaxing . 
B|61| B: You [think] [so] ? 
A|62| A: _We_ , _we_ either crock pot deer [or] we'll _, uh , you know ,_ put [it] out _on the_ grill [so] [that [,] uh] [the] bulk [of] [the] tallow will dribble off [of it .] 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh [.] Well [,] I'm] [a] little _different_ than [other] _people_ [because] [I don't] [have] [benefits] _with my_ job . 
A|64| A: Substitute . _My_ [, my] , yeah , 
B|65| B: [We] [have] [, uh [,] uh ,] four rooms downstairs [, and] [a] pantry 
A|66| A: [Um] . 
B|67| B: [Oh] , [that's] [right] [. I] work [for] [a] law firm 
A|68| A: _Wow ._ 
B|69| B: [It] [really] [does] [, [and] [,] _and] I've seen_ _the same_ [thing] _that you're_ talking [about , uh ,] _much_ _more_ crime than ever before . Drugs [of] _course [,_ uh ,] [a] big part [of it] [I think .] 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: _and [I_ think] [the] last [one] [I] read [like] [that] [was] Scott Thurow's [and] [that] [was] PRESUMED INNOCENT . 
B|73| B: Bye , bye . 
A|74| A: But [you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|75| B: [My] oldest [is , uh ,] four [and] [my] youngest [is] [about] [to] turn three . Two girls [. And] [they] [are] [a] handful 
A|76| A: [And] [the] government [really] plays [a] role [in] [this] . 
B|77| B: Not [getting] _to go_ . 
A|78| A: [My] husband's _family_ [are] reaching [that] point [but] [it's , it's] [so] difficult . Was she [in] favor [of it] [or] _, or_ [was] she [kind of] opposed [to] _it ?_ 
B|79| B: [Right .] 
A|80| A: Of [course [,] the] chemicals themselves [when] [you] buy _them_ , they're expensive [too .] 
B|81| B: [uh [,] they] [can't] use [, like] [, [I] [have] a] friend [that's] [in the] air conditioning heating _business_ 
A|82| A: [I] [just] [don't know] . 
B|83| B: [No] [, it's] [not] realistic . 
A|84| A: [Really] ? 
B|85| B: [Uh ,] _some of_ _them ._ [The] [, the] general travel magazines _do ._ 
A|86| A: [Yeah [,] you] [have] [to] 
B|87| B: [Uh ,] sports car . 
A|88| A: [Yeah [.] [I] _,] as_ [I think] [I] mentioned [, I was] [in the] trust [business] [and I've seen] [so] many elderly [people] . Usually _there_ [has] _to be_ [some] wealth involved , which [is] [great ,] [if] , [if] [you're] financially , [if] , [if] [you] [don't] make [the] decisions [so] late [that you're] worried [about] money [but] _the , the_ places [like] Presbyterian Village [and] [some of] _the , the_ retirement places where , where [they] [have] [different] levels [of] care seems _to be_ [so] [much] better _, as_ far _as_ elderly [people] adapting . 
B|89| B: [you] _do_ [not] [really] [feel] [that] [that] [really] close [to] _them ._ 
A|90| A: [Right .] 
B|91| B: [And] 
A|92| A: [It] [is] inside [and I've] been doing [a] lot [of] bike riding outside [with] [the] _nice_ weather we've been having 
B|93| B: [Right .] 
A|94| A: _Well , I_ guess [I'm] [, uh ,] [more] traditional [in] [that] [I don't] [like] power windows [or] power locks [, because] [the] [people] [that] _I know_ _who_ [have] [them] always seem [to] [have] trouble [with] [them .] 
B|95| B: [but [,] uh [,] I'm] sure [people] [in [,] uh , you know [,] [in] [,] uh ,] Galveston [and so] forth [would be] knowledgeable [about] _it [,_ uh ,] Pensacola [is] [a] Navy town . 
A|96| A: [Right .] 
B|97| B: Okay , [nice] talking [to] [you] . 
A|98| A: [Yeah .] It's [the same] [with [my] husband] cause [he's] [got] pretty flexible hours [if] _, as_ _long_ _as_ he puts [in the] hours he needs [to] [do .] Worked out [really] [well] [for] [us] [too .] 
B|99| B: [Well , [I] know] [it's] hard [for] young [people] [to] [think] [about] giving [up] their years [, you know ,] their carefree years 
A|100| A: [And] [, uh] [I , [I] _think] they_ should . 
B|101| B: [And] [we] [had] _such a_ time [, and] never [got] [the] cat back . 
A|102| A: [I think] [more] [people] [would] [do] [it] [if] [it] wasn't [such a] hassle . 
B|103| B: _Are_ , [are] [you] , [do] [you] [play] [the] [piano] , [is [,] or] [you] [just] [like] [it ?] 
A|104| A: [Oh] [really] . 
B|105| B: [and , uh ,] [that's] [more] important than anything else [. We] [could] [have] sent [, uh ,] her [to] [a] fancier [, uh ,] facility . 
A|106| A: [and] [that] _went_ over real [well ,] 
B|107| B: [Well [,] the] way [things] [are] [going] . 
A|108| A: [I [know] [,] and] [it [,] and] [the] economy here [in] Dallas _, I mean_ , [it [,] it's] steady [, but] [it's] still [not] [going] [up] . 
B|109| B: [And] [as] [, as] time grew [, I mean] [when] time [went] [on [the] family] grew [and] moved away [and so] forth [. And] [now] [when] [they] come together [it's , it's] generally [, you know [,] like] [say] [the] [kids] [of] those [people] [who] [are] [not] [, you know ,] anywhere near [one] another [and I] [do] [not] [think they] [feel] [the , the] closeness [that] [they] used [to be] [there] . Which [is] [a] shame 
A|110| A: [Are] [you] [going] [to go] [to] East Texas [for] [that] ? 
B|111| B: [Wow .] 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [Right .] 
B|114| B: Yes , we're [not] [too] [long] distance [today] .
