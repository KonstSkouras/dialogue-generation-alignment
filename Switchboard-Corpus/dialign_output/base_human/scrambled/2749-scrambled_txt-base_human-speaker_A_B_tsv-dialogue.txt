I] I'll tell [you] [one] quick [, uh ,] [one] [thing] very interesting .

B|31| B: [and we're] hoping [that they] [can] put together something _for_ us here [that] [we] [can] [have the] word processing , here 
A|32| A: No , [usually] [in the] summer _time_ . 
B|33| B: _and [it_ is] hysterical _, I mean_ [and] then [the] _other_ [two] [cats] will follow [in] pursuit . It's [like] [this] train . 
A|34| A: [and it] was [before] [, _I mean] [,_ this] was [before] [we] [even] met . Um , she's [had] [them] _for a_ couple years [. And] um [, you know ,] _they're_ really cute , _they're_ , _they're_ sisters , 
B|35| B: That's [about] [what] [we] [do] _too_ . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh , [well] [, that's] great , that'd [be] _a lot of_ fun [. You] [have _a] lot_ _good_ experiences [from] [that .] [Yeah .] 
B|37| B: [yeah .] So [what] [do] [you] [do] [up] [there] ? 
A|38| A: [And , uh _,] it_ [kind of] makes _me_ listen [a] _little_ closer [to] [, _to] the_ piano when [I] hear [it] at [other] places , [or] when _I , you know ,_ see some , see [and] hear [someone] playing [. I] sort [of] watch [their] technique _, too_ [, and [,] and] see [if] [it] corresponds [up] [to] [what] she's learning . 
B|39| B: [I mean] _as_ you're walking through [that] [little] tour [in [,] uh ,] Munich , [it's kind of] [they're] trying [to] brainwash _you [,_ too] 
A|40| A: Wow . 
B|41| B: [because] since [I'm] [an] international student [, they] [want to] send [me] back [to] Argentina . 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] Huh . 
B|43| B: [We] _just_ [had] [a] bunch [of] [people] over [and we] [had] [, we] did lasagna [and] garlic bread [and [,] uh ,] yummy . 
A|44| A: [Yeah [,] but] [, [you] [,] you] [think that [,] I mean] [if] [you] [think of] how many premeditated murders [are] committed [, you know ,] _compared to_ [that] [and] [to] how many [people] [are] being sent [, that] doesn't seem [like] very many . 
B|45| B: [And I] grew [up] [in] [a] real [not] [, I think] [not] normal setting . 
A|46| A: Ugh ! 
B|47| B: [Oh ,] [it's] [, it is] [. [I] mean ,] [the] , [the] [number] [of] single family units [on] sale [is] phenomenal [compared [to] the] population . 
A|48| A: [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: Thanks . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: Sure , same here . 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: _Uh ,_ [do] [you know] where [, uh ,] Custer [is] ? 
A|54| A: Um . 
B|55| B: [Well ,] [for] [, I] grew [up] [in the] deep south [like] south Alabama . So whenever [I [think] of] family reunions [, my] family , [like] , [got] together almost [every] week . 
A|56| A: [Right , and [,] you know [,] we] can't really depend [on] [the] police [to] solve [all] [this] [, they] [just] can't [do] [it] . 
B|57| B: [And] [so] _we've got_ plenty [of] [time] [to] go _, because_ down here [in] Houston , [it's] [, uh ,] [the] lines [are] long . 
A|58| A: As [, as] [you know ,] anything [that] involves [the] government [is ,] works half [as] [well] [as] [it's] supposed [to] costs three times [as] much . [Right] ? 
B|59| B: [Yeah . [I ,] you know [,] I think] [it] [would] [be] [good] [for [a] lot of] [people] [to get] involved [in] [that] [kind of] [program] , 
A|60| A: [Uh [,] [we've] got] five bedrooms [, because] [we] built onto our garage .
