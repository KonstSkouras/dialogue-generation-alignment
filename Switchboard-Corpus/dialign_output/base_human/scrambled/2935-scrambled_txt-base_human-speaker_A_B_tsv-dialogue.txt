B|51| B: [Yeah .] 
A|52| A: [And] [so] [they] went [and] tried [out] [and] [my] husband played Harold Hill from [the] Music Man [and] [my] son played [one [of] the] children [in] [a] band . 
B|53| B: Didn't [one] , 
A|54| A: [Right] 
B|55| B: _Oh [,_ well ,] [it's] [not] [that] long ago [. It] _was_ , _Oh ,_ twelve times , [of the] year .

B|57| B: _Oh [,_ oh [,] you] are ? 
A|58| A: _Oh _._ [Well ,_ I] tell [you] [this] , [the] weather here [and] there's [no] mountains _or anything_ [, you know [,] and] when [you] [go] _to a_ football game [in] Colorado [that's] [, you know ,] there's snow [and] [it's] an adventure [And] here [, yeah] you've _just_ [got] [to] drive down [to] [the _,] to_ [the] stadium 
B|59| B: [Yeah .] 
A|60| A: [and] [it] _just_ seemed [like] _it would be_ [a] fun [place] _to go_ [. [And] ,] _So_ [we [,] we] [didn't] [really] [have] enough [time] . 
B|61| B: [And [,] um [,] I think] [it would be] [, I] [know] [that] [also] [one of] [my] cousins who [, uh ,] he [is] [in] [like] [the] therapy [type] [thing] [and] he [was] [, um [,] some] [group] paid part [of] his college income [but] then he [was] required [to go] back [and] [work] [for] [a] certain number [of] [years] [in] [this] town [at] [, uh [,] uh , I mean ,] [it's a] nursing home [or] _something like that ._ 
A|62| A: Like [I] say [it's] _just_ , 
B|63| B: Do [do] [you] put [it] [in] [the] refrigerator then [or] 
A|64| A: _Oh ._ 
B|65| B: [Oh .] _Oh ,_ [that's] nice [, I] , [this] [is] different [for] us [because] [the] other [, in] [the] past we've [had] homes [that] haven't [had any] side walks [, and [,] um ,] [it's] [been] [a] little more [country] [with] [the] trees [, [and] we] [do] miss [that .] [Um [,] if] [we had] [a] chance [to move] [, I think] we'd [move] back [to] somewhere [that] [was] [a] little more countrified [and] [a] little less maintenance required as , as far as [that] goes . 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [So] [, I] grew [up] [with] [a lot of] his music [, [and ,] and] what [not] . Plus [my] parents are [, well , especially] [my] dad , likes [a lot of] classical music [and] he introduced [my] brother [and] [I] both [, [to] [a] lot of] [it .] [So] , 
A|68| A: [Oh [,] [I think] that's] great . 
B|69| B: No cracked slab [or anything] [like that] ? 
A|70| A: [Well] [you] must [have a] , _just_ [one] hero ace professional job [to] support [something like that .] 
B|71| B: [I] _don't_ [know] [if] , [they] _don't have_ them [up] [there] [do] [they] ? 
A|72| A: [Um ,] thinking [about] [it [,] some] [of the] ways [I] try [and] keep [up] [on] current events [is] [, uh , I] [enjoy] reading [the] newspaper [, _but ,] uh ,_ quite often [don't have] [time] [to] read [all [of] the] newspaper [, and so [,] uh , I] [enjoy] watching [some] [of the] T V highlights [and] [also] [, uh [,] some] [of the] news periodicals [, uh ,] weekly magazines [, [and ,] uh ,] [at] [work] [I] [also] [have , uh ,] management summary reports [that , uh ,] give _basically_ [a lot [of] the] current events . [Uh ,] how [about] yourself ? 
B|73| B: [Oh [,] yeah [.] Well ,] most [of] [my] camping [, I] haven't done much since [I] [was] [a] kid [but , uh ,] we'd , [basically] , take [the] tent [up] [in] [the] Sierras [and , uh ,] usually [just] camp near [some] stream [or] [some] lake . 
A|74| A: That's [the] last [thing] [you] want [, to] [do] . 
B|75| B: [Yeah .] Methanol ?
