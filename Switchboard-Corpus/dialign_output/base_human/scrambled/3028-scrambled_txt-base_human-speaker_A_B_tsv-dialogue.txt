A|6| A: [And] since _I was _just_ , you know ,_ _one_ _of the_ office folk _, I guess_ _it wasn't_ _as_ important _to_ _them_ _that they_ test _me_ regularly . But _I_ _know_ _they_ test most _of the_ service _people_ fairly regularly _uh ,_ _just_ across _the_ board . 
B|7| B: There probably needs _to be_ _some_ training _on_ _how_ _to ,_ _to ,_ [to] adjust [to] these changes [as] [they] _come_ _about_ _. _I_ mean_ _if you_ _look_ at _the , the_ high unemployment rate right _now_ _and_ [you] _look_ at [people] who _are_ _in_ _those_ situations [, I] don't [know] [that they] _have_ good coping skills _or_ _a lot of_ _them ,_ _even_ ideas [of] _how_ _to make_ _those_ changes _now_ .

B|13| B: _and ,_ 
A|14| A: [and] somebody _will_ turn _it_ [in] _and , and_ _nothing_ _will_ [be] missing _. They_ said [they] _can_ _just_ [about] guarantee [that] _there _,_ _that_ _,_ that_ would happen [if you] _did_ _that . I_ thought , boy _, in_ America , [if you] left [a] purse [on] [a] subway _, you_ would never _see_ _it_ again . 
B|15| B: _it's ,_ 
A|16| A: _That's_ [how] _bad_ _it [,_ I] _know ._ 
B|17| B: Tibby _is the_ dog [and] Liberty _is the_ cat . 
A|18| A: Right [. _And] , uh ,_ yeah _everybody_ , _everybody_ _was_ _pretty_ _much_ _, you know ,_ let's burn _him_ . 
B|19| B: _Because_ [they] _were_ _looking_ for _this_ disposition [. And] nowadays _you ,_ you'll _get ,_ you'll _get_ [a] dog trainer [to] recommend [a] specific [, you know ,] breeder handler [. They] [will] recommend their shepherds [as] [a] children's dog . 
A|20| A: More taxes [you] _pay_ . 
B|21| B: [and _, and] _I_ think_ [, you know ,] 
A|22| A: Hi . 
B|23| B: [Yeah _,] that's_ [, _I] I_ agree [, _I] think_ _that's_ where [it] stems _from_ _, is_ [that] _and , um [,_ you know ,] you've [got] _a lot _of_ ,_ _a lot_ _more_ women [that] _are_ _working_ nowadays [that] aren't _home_ _with_ [the] children 
A|24| A: [I mean] _it was_ amazing . 
B|25| B: [You] [know] _like_ [people] [that] _are_ [in] prison [, [I] mean] _we_ didn't _put_ [them] [there] [. They] _put_ themselves [in] [that] situation . 
A|26| A: _I mean , you know_ 
B|27| B: _and that_ [was just] trying [to] hold _us ,_ getting _out_ _of that_ [was] [a] used _car_ . 
A|28| A: [Okay .] 
B|29| B: Bye-bye . 
A|30| A: [um _,] but_ [there] [is] starting [to _,] in_ Minneapolis itself _, because_ [of] _so many_ [people] _on the_ highway , [there] [is] becoming [a] _problem_ [of] pollution _, and they_ [just] _put _in_ a_ strict law [that] [as] [of] _every_ year _when_ [you] [get] your license tabs [you] _have to have_ your [car] inspected _to see_ [if] [it's] releasing _any_ _, uh ,_ lead into [the] air [or] _other_ pollutants , 
B|31| B: [Yeah .] 
A|32| A: Wow . 
B|33| B: His middle _name_ [is] Chris , [or] Christopher for for _her_ daddy , 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [And] he describes [it] [as] [, you] sit [there] [in a] crowd _, [it_ was] nice weather [and] stuff _, [it_ wasn't] [a] real [problem] [, but] [you] sit [there] [in a] crowd [, and] you're waiting [and] waiting [and] waiting [and] [you] eat these lousy [the] hot dogs [um [,] because] _we made_ [him] try [a] hot dog [, you know ,] 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: [Yeah [,] _I] think_ _it's , it's_ _somewhat_ _a [,_ uh ,] symptom [of] _our_ , [me] generation _and [that_ ,] _we_ _think_ _we_ need all these _things_ _and _I_ think_ _my_ parents always [, you know ,] [did] without [or] saved _up_ [to [,] you know ,] buy _things_ _and we_ consider [that] [so many] [of] these _things_ _we_ [just] [have to have] [, you know ,] _like_ [when] [I] first [got] _my_ apartment _and [I_ was] setting [it] _up_ [I] [did] try [to] economize _some_ _but [,_ you know [,] [I] was just] _like_ , well [, I] [have to have] [it] all furnished _and I_ [have to have] all [of] _my_ kitchen setup [and] [you] don't [, you know ,] do without _too_ [much] [and [,] you know _,] that's_ [how] [I] [got] started _kind of_ _with_ setting _up_ [a] household all _up_ [, you know _,] it_ _kind of_ _like_ _, in the_ short amount _of time_ [. You] [know [,] you] [just] [have to have] these _things_ [just , you know ,] _have them_ at _home_ , [have to _have] them_ at _my_ own place [and] _that's_ [, you know ,] [a] big expenditure [to] _start_ _, um ,_ buying all these _things_ [that] [you] _think_ [or] , [or] [have to have] _and actually_ _they're_ _kind of_ luxuries [or] [you] should save _up_ slowly [and] keep buying [them] [and] _not_ [just] rush _out and_ furnish [the] whole place [, you know ,] going [in] [one] big swoop , save _up_ _and then_ buy _it ._ 
A|40| A: _Uh _,_ but ,_ 
B|41| B: [You] [know _,] there's_ [nothing] _in there_ [that] [can] wrap around _the , _the_ , uh ,_ rollers [or] anything . It seems _like_ [a] _really_ good answer [to] portable music [, that] _you can_ choose . 
A|42| A: _And , uh ,_ 
B|43| B: [and [,] uh _,] I've_ gotten good at [it] which [in _a] [,_ [in] a] way [is] [bad] [because] _then_ _you [,_ uh [,] you] _start_ [to] take pleasure _in it_ 
A|44| A: [Well ,] [I'm] , [are you] [there] ? 
B|45| B: [Oh [,] that] works . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [And] [have] [, you know ,] _like_ three [or] four couples _come_ over [, and] I'll do [the] potatoes [and] [you know ,] _like_ butter [and] cheese [and] stuff [and] [have] [everybody] else [just] bring [a] couple [of] toppings , _whatever_ [they] _like_ 
A|48| A: [Yeah .] [It's [,] it's] [not] _, they're_ [not] withholding information , 
B|49| B: _whatever_ [I'm] _doing_ [, I] watch [that . I] usually watch [the] news , either at [, you know ,] early evening [or] at ten o'clock 
A|50| A: [And] [they] sell _, I guess_ [they] sell everything _to some_ waste company [that] comes [and] _gets_ [it .] 
B|51| B: [Okay .] 
A|52| A: [Because] [even] [if you] said , okay [, you know ,] armed forces _could_ [have [them] ,] [some] idiot would [come] [out and] sell [it] [to] somebody _on the_ street [to make] [a] quick buck . 
B|53| B: Um . 
A|54| A: Nursing homes . 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: _Uh-huh . Yeah [._ You] [get [,] it] _back_ , yeah . 
B|57| B: [Yeah .] 
A|58| A: _Uh-huh . [Yeah_ [,] I've] seen [that .] 
B|59| B: [and] _so I_ learned [that] [on] [there] _too_ [, that] [was] , 
A|60| A: _Uh ,_ [there] [is] [a lot] [, you] ever go _by_ Lucky Computer [there] ? 
B|61| B: _Uh-huh . _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ Uh-huh ._ 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh . _Uh-huh .] Yeah _._ That's_ _something_ [, you know] _but , uh ,_ whether [they] plea bargain [or] [not] , [if] [they're] guilty [of] murder _, they're_ guilty [of] murder [, you _know] ._ 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: _So_ [we] [were] [kind of] pitiful . We found [one] restaurant [we] [were] [in] [and] [got] seated [, [and] then] _no_ [one] knew English _in there _, and_ we_ [were] [just] finally _had_ [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] [start] [looking] [up] [things] . 
B|65| B: _Well , I_ do [it] all 
A|66| A: Both . If we're [not] [doing] sports [we] go somewhere . 
B|67| B: [Yeah [,] I] tape [it] _because I_ don't stay [up] [that] late [to] watch [it ,] 
A|68| A: _Oh , that's_ great , sounds [like] [you ,] 
B|69| B: [And] [every] once [in a] while , I'll [put in] , I'll slice white grapes [and] I'll [put [in] there , [and] [,] that's] [just] [because] [I'm] [not] [a] real big wine person [but] [I] [like] [it [,] it] adds [something] [to] [the] chicken . 
A|70| A: [because] [kind of] hard [to] _find_ [one] prebuilt [that] 's [kind of] fits [those] specifications . 
B|71| B: [but] his _, what_ he does [is] , [when] he [gets] _home_ , he separates his work _from_ his _house_ . 
A|72| A: [Yeah [,] _is] it_ [a [,] _is] it_ [a] [working] farm [or] _is it_ ? 
B|73| B: [Uh ,] _almost_ an addition [, uh [,] [and] , [and] [, and] we] [could] equate [or] relate relay well [to _some] of the_ newspaper [and] television articles [about] [the] fact [that] [people] where having _this_ [problem] [in] [, in] unhooking , uncoupling _from_ [the] events [, and] going [on] _with_ their . [So] , 
A|74| A: [Well ,] _no_ [that's] [my] _other_ phone . 
B|75| B: [And] [not] being cared for . 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [I mean [, you know] [,] that] [was just] [so] phenomenal [to see] _this_ stadium shake [and] _the [,_ and] [the] announcers [, you know] grabbing , 
A|78| A: [Yeah .] [Well , I] took [a lot [of] time] [in] choosing [this] site [because] [the , the] [house] has _no_ heating [or] air conditioning . 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh . Yeah .] 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [Well [, I] guess] [I] stand [on] [, uh ,] [on] , probably ten for _no [,_ uh ,] restrictions [. _I] [,_ uh ,] recently [just] moved [to] Texas _from_ _, uh , South Dakota_ [and] Nebraska _, and [I_ guess] [in] terms [of] gun control [I've] always [, uh ,] been raised _with_ _the , uh ,_ idea _in the_ Constitution [that [,] uh ,] citizens [had] [a] right [to] bear arms _, and I_ realize [that] probably way [back] [when] [when] [the] Constitution [was] written [it] probably regarded _, uh , more_ [, uh ,] [of] [a] national defense [, uh ,] _than_ anything else [, [but ,] uh ,] [on the] [other] hand , _too_ [, uh ,] [people] [then] [, uh ,] needed [to] _use_ firearms for _, um ,_ survival [in] terms _of , uh ,_ food 
A|82| A: _Oh ._ 
B|83| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [Yeah] 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [when] [they're] decreasing [some of the] military spending , [some [of] that] _money_ has gone into [the] Peace Corps 
B|89| B: [Okay .] 
A|90| A: The Legend . [Uh] . 
B|91| B: Interesting thing [about] gas [is] [when] [, [I] mean ,] [about] battery powered cars [is] [when] you're at [a] stop light , you're [not] using [any] [any] _energy_ 
A|92| A: [and that] [got] [to be] [somewhat] expensive , [so [I] [I] think] [one] [of the] benefits _I , I_ [see] [is [the] , uh [,] [is] the] group [, uh ,] group discount . 
B|93| B: Have [I] ? 
A|94| A: [Yeah [,] it] [is] hard 
B|95| B: Like [you] take Asian countries , [or] [, uh [,] the] Eastern countries where women [are] [like] _in the_ foreground _, uh , in the_ background [and] [the] men [are] _in the_ foreground , 
A|96| A: My grandmother lived [with] [us [,] um ,] until August [, um [,] and [we] made] [the] decision [to] [put] [her] [in a] nursing [home] . She has leukemia 
B|97| B: [You] [know .] In [that] standpoint . 
A|98| A: Unless [, [it's] , it's] [a] toy . 
B|99| B: [And , uh ,] they've been [to] [the] Guadalupe River [, and they] _also , uh [,_ uh ,] [have] been [to [,] uh [,] I guess] Colorado [, and] they've _really_ enjoyed [it .] 
A|100| A: [Yeah [,] and] _they're , they're_ very expensive [too .] . 
B|101| B: [Oh] _no [,_ they're] [just [,] [they're] , they're] [just [,] uh [,] they're] wonderful [, uh] . 
A|102| A: [and] [there's] [almost] [no] [energy] [, there's] very little [energy] value [in] [actually] [doing] [a lot [of] the] recycling [, but] [there] [is] [a lot of] [energy] [in it] [if [you] can] burn [it] [and] [use] [it ,] produce electricity . 
B|103| B: [and they] [have] [a] bunch [of] computers leftover _from_ [that] 
A|104| A: [this] [is] gross . 
B|105| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [And] [then] [there's] [also , uh [,] what] [we] found [, uh , in the] state [of [, uh ,] South Dakota] [, the] Black Hills . 
B|107| B: Yep . 
A|108| A: _Oh ._ 
B|109| B: Monday night's [pretty] good [with] MURPHY BROWN [and] DESIGNING WOMEN . 
A|110| A: [Okay .] 
B|111| B: [So] [I] [find] [that] [it] makes [up] for [what] [I] [pay] for insurance _and [I_ , I] [make] enough [money] [by] [the] hour [to make] [up] for [that .] 
A|112| A: [but , uh [,] it's] unfortunate [, but] [now] [, I've] [got] another [one] , [so] . 
B|113| B: [so] , 
A|114| A: [and we] [really] [, uh ,] lessened [it [,] uh ,] [our] living expenses [, uh , more] [than] [what] [we] thought [we] would . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [because [I] was] already [in] Hong Kong [and , um [,] but] [it] only cost [you] [about] [a] thousand dollars [to] go [there] [and I] went [to] Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu [and actually] [then] [I] took [a] train [up] [from] Shanghai [to] [a] little , Quingdao [I think] [is the] [name] [of] [it .] [It's] [a] little [, uh ,] sort [of] getaway retreat village [not] far [from] Shanghai . [It's] [just] [a] train ride . 
B|117| B: Huh . 
A|118| A: Right . 
B|119| B: [Yeah .] 
A|120| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|121| B: [Oh , that's] [too] [much] trouble [. That's] [too] [much] trouble . Didn't want [to] cook . 
A|122| A: [Well ,] great [. That's] excellent . 
B|123| B: [And] [is [it] [,] um ,] [a] natural gas [and ,] 
A|124| A: [Yeah .] 
B|125| B: [Oh .] 
A|126| A: No [, because] [they] [use] everything [they] [can] [and] [make] [this] into pressed [whatever] [. They] [use] [the ,] [they] [use] [the] insides [of the] animals , heart [and] liver [and they] , [they] form [it [,] and they] [make] [it] [look] [like] roast beef [, and I] said , [no ,] thank [you] .
