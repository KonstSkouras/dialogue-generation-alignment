A|0| A: Okay . _Well _,_ how_ _do_ _you_ feel about _, uh , drug_ _testing_ ?

A|2| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|3| B: Um _, I would_ never _, I would_ never _have_ _a_ _problem_ _with_ anyone [testing] _me_ _, but I_ _can_ understand why _people_ _would_ object . So _, I guess _,_ uh _, I_ guess [,_ uh ,] I'm kind _of_ mixed _on_ _it ,_ still _at_ _this_ point . 
A|4| A: _Yeah . I_ am _too_ _a little_ bit [, I] mean _, I , I don't_ want _to_ _be_ _around_ _people who_ _are_ _really_ [on] drugs _and that_ sort [of] thing , 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and _, and_ _,_ you know ,_ _obviously_ they're probably _not_ _going to_ _be_ doing _a good_ _job_ [and] _so_ forth [, but [I] don't] _really_ _like_ having _to do_ _it _._ It ,_ 
B|7| B: That's right .

B|9| B: That's absolutely right [.

A|10| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|11| B: Uh _, uh [, _I_ don't] think_ anybody _would_ ever argue [that] . Or [, uh ,] _any_ , _any_ after affects carrying over _into_ [the] workday 
A|12| A: Huh-uh . 
B|13| B: _but _,_ um _,_ you know [, I_ don't] , I'm [not] particularly concerned _with_ _what_ [people] _do _,_ um ,_ after _they_ leave _for_ [the] day especially _if [I_ don't] _, _if_ [I_ don't] [, uh ,] see _any_ results [of it] [the] next day .

B|19| B: That's right . That's right . _Right ._ even [if] [it] _is [,_ you know ,] [a] [company] policy [of] [, uh ,] immediate termination [or whatever] _, they_ still _have_ [to] replace _them_ . 
A|20| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|21| B: [And] [, uh ,] there's , there's [a] lot involved there . 
A|22| A: [Well ,] [do] [you] _think _that_ _, um ,_ it_ _should_ [be] [like] _we have_ [this] sort [of] random spot [testing] _type_ [of] thing [or] [do] [you] [think] [it] _would be_ more palatable [if] _we_ _had some_ sort [of] _regular schedule_ [or] [would] [that] _just_ allow _everybody_ [a] chance _to _get_ out of it_ ? 
B|23| B: [I think] [, I think] [the] [regular schedule] stuff [, um _,] that_ when [you] _say_ [everybody] [get out [of it] _,] that's_ [a good] point [, I] never [really] _thought_ [of it] [that] _way ._ 
A|24| A: [Well _,] you know , _if_ _,_ if they_ [have] time _enough_ [they] _can ,_ stay off [of _it] ._ 
B|25| B: [Yeah [,] if they] [really] [can [,] um [,] I think] [the] [the] biggest [problem] I've _got_ _is ,_ _is_ forcing [it] [on] someone after [they've] already agreed _to the_ terms [of] employment . 
A|26| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|27| B: Um , as far as [the] new hires [, I , I] hired [on] [just] early [enough] [that] [I , I] missed [it .] Um , where [the] new hires _were_ concerned _but , uh ,_ [not] , nobody , no [, _I don't] think_ anybody questions [that , um ,] [testing] someone as [a] , as [a] precondition [to] being hired _but [,_ um ,] [for] [the] conditions [that ,] [for] our employment [to] change while you're [on] [the] [job] _that's [,_ I , I don't] _know , [that_ _,] that's_ where _I think that_ most [people] [get] upset . It's [, uh [,] you know [,] [it] , it's] changing [the] rules _in the_ middle [of] [the] game basically [and [,] uh ,] It's [just] [, [it] , it's] [a] [really] tough question 
A|28| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|29| B: [and] [it [,] you know [,] [it] ,] [people] [have] , [have] [really] _quieted down_ after everything started [but I] still [think] there's [a] lot [of] , there's [a] lot [of] resentment . 
A|30| A: _I think so_ _too_ [, uh _, I] know_ _the , the_ group _I was_ [in] [at] [the] time [this] [all] came _up_ [they] [, uh _,] were_ _quite_ vocal about [it ,] through electronic mail , boy [, they] _just really [,_ you know] let [them] [have] [it] _from_ one end [to [the] other] , vehemently 
B|31| B: _Uh-huh ._ _You_ bet . 
A|32| A: [but _, uh ,] it_ _has_ [quieted down] [, but [I] don't think] [they] probably feel [any] differently , 
B|33| B: _No_ _, that's_ right . 
A|34| A: [and] [some] _, some_ [of] [them] _did_ quit [the _company] ._ 
B|35| B: _Yeah [, I_ [, I] know] [of] [some] [people who] [did] [, uh , _it] was_ [, _it] was_ indirectly related [, you know [,] they] _could_ always come _up with_ [other] reasons [but] [it [,] it] [had] [a] lot [to do] _with_ [it .] Just [the , _the] whole_ attitude , because [it's] [really [,] uh [,] it's] [just really [,] [it] [,] it] seems [so] T [I [,] you know ,] _with [the_ , _the] whole_ relaxed atmosphere [that] [we have] [, um _,] to_ [all] [of a] sudden [, uh ,] search [for] attitudes [and] whatnot . 
A|36| A: True . 
B|37| B: _You know ,_ there's [not] [a] lot [of] pressure _to , to_ vote [the] right _way_ [or] _anything_ else [around] T [I] . Like there , [like] there _is_ [in] [some] companies [or] [at] least [, you know ,] [from] [what] I've heard , 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [but , uh [,] yeah] 
A|40| A: [Yeah , I] _wouldn't_ [like] [anything] [of] [that] nature [, you know ,] 
B|41| B: [Uh-huh _.] No_ [, I ,] 
A|42| A: [don't] tell [me] [what] [to [do] [,] you know] . 
B|43| B: Absolutely [not] [, you know [, it's] [, it's ,] it's [,] you know , if] [you] hired [me] I'll [be] [, you know ,] supposedly _your_ grade [was] [a little] majority [of] my views [and] my qualifications [to] begin _with_ [so] [, uh [,] you know _,] let's_ _, let's_ stick _with_ [that] original trust [, I guess] . 
A|44| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|45| B: [But [,] uh [,] it's , it's] still [, [it] [,] it] still remains [a] tough question [and [,] it's ,] there's [a] lot [of] [, you know [,] _the] whole_ [, _the] whole_ department [of] defense [, uh ,] reasoning behind [the] original plan [and] whatnot . There's [a] lot [of] different [things] _that , uh ,_ come [into] play [but] [that] [was] [, I think] [everybody] , [everybody] pretty [much] knows [that] [that] [was] kind [of a] smoke screen [to] implement [it] throughout _the whole_ [company .] 
A|46| A: _Yeah ._ [Well [,] I guess] _too_ [if I] [thought] [that] [this] [would] _help_ [really] [and] truly [do] away [with the] [drug] [problem] , then [that] _would be_ one thing . [But] [I think] [it's] _too_ minor [and] _too_ [, you know ,] 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: _in ,_ [in [the] whole] scope _of things_ [this] isn't _going [to ,_ to] [have] [any] real [affect] [on ,] what's _going_ [on] [in the] street . 
B|49| B: [I] [really] [don't [think] so] . [Yeah . I] [really] [don't] because [, some] [people] [are] [going to ,] [are] , [are] [going to] risk [it [,] um , it] may prevent [, I [, I] guess [,] I guess] [what] I'm trying [to get] [at] _is [,_ if] [it [,] if] [it [,] if] [it] does [help] [a] few individuals maybe , maybe [it's] worth [it .] 
A|50| A: [Yeah .] 
B|51| B: Um [, you know [,] it] may prevent somebody [who] [was] , [was] teetering [on] [the] edge [of] experimenting [or] whatnot [but [, uh [,] I] don't] [know] [if [,] you know [,] [the] [,] it's , it's] [a] needs [of] [the] few [and] [the] needs [of] [the] many [type] situation [I don't] [know] [if] [everybody] [should] [have] [to] sacrifice [quite] as [much] . There , there's still [a big] question [in] my mind [that [,] [the] , the] absolute refusal [to] accept [the] possibility [of] , [of] mistakes [on] [the] [testing] , _is_ [something] [that] still bothers [me] . 
A|52| A: [Well ,] yes . 
B|53| B: [It [,] it's ,] 
A|54| A: That , yes [. _I] , [I think_ that] [could be] [a big] [problem] [, you know [, I] would] [just] [be] irate [if they] said [it was] _positive and_ [I] knew [it] wasn't , 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [you know , that] [just really] rubbed [me] [the] wrong [way .] 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] Absolutely . [And] [that [,] I , I don't] [know] [if [,] uh [, I] don't] [know] [if] [everybody] understands [all] [the] implications [on] [that] [too .] even [if] [you] [, you know , if] _you take_ [, uh ,] [a] , [a] [drug] [that] [was] prescribed [for] [you] [but] [the , the] prescription [has] run [out] [you] still [had some] left _and you_ happen [to] _take_ an extra penicillin , well , penicillin's [not] [on] [the] list [but [,] you know ,] 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: [yeah [, [I] , I] think] [you] understand [what] I'm getting [at] , 
A|60| A: [Yeah .] 
B|61| B: [it [,] it] [can] still show [up] [and] [it] [can] still flag as [a] [positive [and] , and] [those] kinds [of things] [obviously] _that's not_ [the] intent , 
A|62| A: [Right [.] No] . 
B|63| B: [and [,] uh ,] [those] [are] [the] kinds [of things] [that] still [can] show [up] . 
A|64| A: [I guess] [the] one [that] [really] [got] [me] [too] [was] [that , uh [,] let's] [say] [your] spouse [is] [on] [a] particular [drug] [and [you] know] [what] [that] [is ,] 
B|65| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [and] then [you] end [up [with] the] same [problem] [and [you] take] [their] leftover _medicine_ [, [that's] not] allowed . 
B|67| B: That's right . 
A|68| A: [You know [,] [that's] [,] that's] totally [out] . 
B|69| B: That's right [. I] even [had] friends when [I was] [going to] college [who] [were] [in [,] uh ,] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally [, um ,] provide [medicine] [to] [their] family family members [and] friends certain medicines [were] [, were] legal now [I [, I] , I] believe [, you know ,] [any] [of] [the ,] [any] [of] [the] ones [we] [would] , [we] [would be] tested [for] [wouldn't] [be] [on] [those] lists , 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but , uh [,] um ,] there [were] certain [things] [that] [they] [could] provide without [a] doctors prescription based [on] [their] qualifications [and [,] that] [can] happen . 
A|72| A: Oh [, that's] interesting . 
B|73| B: [But [,] uh ,] 
A|74| A: [Well [,] I guess] we've exhausted [that] one . 
B|75| B: [Yeah , yeah , I think so] 
A|76| A: enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|77| B: [You] [too .] 
A|78| A: _Good-bye ._
