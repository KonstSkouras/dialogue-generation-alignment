B|13| B: _Right ,_ especially _, uh _,_ you_ , since you're _in _the_ same_ metroplex _, you know ,_ _there's_ [so] much [going] [on] _here_ . 
A|14| A: [I think] [the] drive by shootings _are_ _getting_ _to_ be [so] common _, that's_ [really] _a_ , _something_ [you] _got_ _to_ protect yourself _from_ .

A|16| A: _Uh-huh_ , golly _I [know_ .] 
B|17| B: _and ,_ 
A|18| A: Have _they_ done [that] [in] Garland ? 
B|19| B: _No [,_ I] , _not_ [that] _I'm_ aware _of_ . 
A|20| A: Now _, um ,_ 
B|21| B: _I just_ heard _, you know ,_ _last_ week [at] [that] [one] _school [,_ they] started putting _them_ [in] because _there_ _was_ [that] [one] shooting 
A|22| A: _Right ._ 
B|23| B: _so [,_ um ,] 
A|24| A: [Well ,] we _had_ _a_ vice principal _shot_ [at] [here] [last] year [on] _the [,_ you know ,] [on] [the] [school] grounds after [school] . 
B|25| B: Is [that] [right] ? 
A|26| A: And [the] [one] boy killed _himself_ _a_ few years ago , [in _the] ,_ [in] _a_ grade [school ,] [so] [you know ,] _these_ kids [don't] have any trouble _getting_ _a_ hold [of] guns [in] any [in] any neighborhood , doesn't seem like . 
B|27| B: _Uh-huh _._ Yeah ,_ yeah . 
A|28| A: So [. Yeah _,] it's_ kind [of] scary [to] _think [,_ you] send your child [to] [school] [and] [you] wonder _if_ he's [going] _to get_ _shot_ . [I] mean , we didn't have [to] worry _about_ [that] before . 
B|29| B: [I know] 
A|30| A: What next ? 
B|31| B: _I know [,_ it's] [, it's] [, it's] [getting] [, it's] [been] [out] [of] hand [, _I think] ,_ [for] [a] while [, and] [it] _just_ continues [to get] worse . 
A|32| A: _Right , [and_ [,] you know ,] we can't [really] depend [on] [the] police [to] solve _all_ _this_ [, they] [just] can't do _it ._ 
B|33| B: [Yeah] . 
A|34| A: [I think] [it] goes _all the_ way back [to] [the] break _up_ [of] [the] _family_ [to] [a] certain extent 
B|35| B: [Right .] 
A|36| A: [and [,] uh [,] and] how we [going] [to] bring [that] back together . 
B|37| B: [Yeah _,] that's [,_ I] [I] agree [, I think] [that's] where [it] stems [from] , _is that_ [and [,] um [,] you know ,] you've [got] [a] lot _of ,_ [a] lot _more_ women [that] [are] [working] nowadays [that] aren't home _with_ [the] children 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right] [and ,] 
B|39| B: [and] [that] may impact [it] as [well] .

B|43| B: [Yeah] 
A|44| A: [I think] [I think] years past maybe our criminals _had_ [a] little [more] morals [, you know] wouldn't kill somebody [in] cold blood . 
B|45| B: [they] [don't] [think] twice _about [it_ [.] Yeah] . Either [that] [or] [I] [don't] [know] [if] [it] _happened_ [and] [it] [wasn't] as highly publicized as [it] [is] _now ,_ [or] [what] [the ,] [what] [the ,] 
A|46| A: [I think] [it] [was] [just] rare [, I] [really] do .

B|51| B: Himself [and] [her] ? 
A|52| A: [Yeah [,] that] must have [been] [at] least fifty years ago [or] [more] , but [the] point [of] [the] _story_ [is [that] [,] that] [was] [so] unbelievable [a] thing [in] those _days_ [that] [it] [was] [in] _all the_ papers , _all_ over [the] country [for] weeks 
B|53| B: [Oh ,] wow [, I] bet . 
A|54| A: but [now [,] you know [,] you] wouldn't probably read [about it] [here] [in] Texas 
B|55| B: [Oh [,] _I] know ,_

B|57| B: [Well [,] they] were [, I] [was] watching [some] show [the] other [day] [, and] [they] were talking [about [,] uh ,] mass murderers 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and] [they] brought [up] [what] _happened_ [in] Killeen [here] recently [, and] [they] were [saying] [, you know [,] that] [these] guys want attention [, and] [that] [when] [it] happens they're glorified because [all the] newspaper [, it's] [on] [all the] newspapers [and] T V _and everything_ , 
A|60| A: Um . [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] [Right ,] lots [of] _their_ picture [and] _life story_ [and everything] .

B|69| B: Is [that] [right] ?
