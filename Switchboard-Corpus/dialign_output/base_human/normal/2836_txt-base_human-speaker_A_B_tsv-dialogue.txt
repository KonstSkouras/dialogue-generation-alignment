A|0| A: Okay _. Uh ,_ far as _, you know ,_ _crime_ _in the_ cities , _I'm_ sure _, like_ _in_ yours _it's_ pretty , pretty _bad _._ Uh ,_ _probably the_ biggest _thing_ we've got _going_ _now_ _is_ _the_ robberies _and_ theft _and_ _probably_ murder _are_ _the_ two top ones _that_ _we_ _have_ . 
B|1| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: How _about_ _you_ ? 
B|3| B: [Uh _,] well _,_ I_ _don't_ _actually_ _live [in_ _the] city _,_ but_ _I'd_ [probably] _say that's_ roughly _right_ _. _I_ mean_ _crimes_ against property seem _to_ outnumber _crimes_ against _life_ _, but_ _I _, I_ think_ _with_ [the] current war _on_ _drugs_ _and all_ this kind _of stuff_ _I'd_ _say [probably_ _the] police_ department _would_ claim [the] number _one_ _crimes ,_ _crimes_ [are] [probably] solicitation _of_ prostitution _, uh , and_ sale _of_ _drugs_ . 
A|4| A: [Uh-huh .] [probably] _right _,_ if_ _you_ look at _it_ _from_ _that_ stand point . 
B|5| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|6| A: What [, uh ,] _is_ _there_ anything [, uh ,] _that you_ particularly [are] concerned [with] [in] your particular area as far as security [and] _that _sort of_ thing_ ? 
B|7| B: [Uh _,] where_ _I live_ [now] _it's _,_ _it's_ not_ _so_ [bad _.] _I_ mean_ _I_ _can_ _basically_ leave _my_ front door unlocked [and] _not_ _have to_ worry [about] [it] [. Uh _,] but_ _I_ _do_ [have] friends [that] _live [in_ _the] city_ _and _I_ think _that_ they_ _get _a_ lot of_ fallout [from] this war _on_ drug [thing] [. Uh _,] just_ _because_ [there] [are] [, like] , crack houses [, you know ,] _on_ _their_ street [and] _stuff_ [like] this . 
A|8| A: [Uh-huh .] Do [you] [live in] [a] _real_ small town _or_ , _or_ _out in the country_ ? 
B|9| B: _I live_ [out _in the country] ,_ yeah . 
A|10| A: How far [out] [from] [the city _,] I mean ,_ _do _you_ ,_ 
B|11| B: [I'm] [about] _fifteen miles_ [out] . 
A|12| A: About [fifteen miles] [. [I] [live] in] _a little_ suburb [, uh ,] which _is [,_ I] guess [from] Dallas _is_ twelve [miles] _or_ [so] 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [but] [it's] pretty congested . We [are] considered [in the country ,] 
B|15| B: Um . 
A|16| A: [but] [it] doesn't really feel [like] _you're_ [in the country] . 
B|17| B: Um . 
A|18| A: Our major _crimes _in_ our_ immediate town [, uh ,] _is_ [probably] robberies , house robberies [and] very few instances [of] [, you know ,] alcohol , [drugs] [, uh ,] reported . 
B|19| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: However , [I'm] sure _they're_ [there] . 
B|21| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: _But [,_ uh _,] right_ [now] _our_ neighborhood _is_ running _about [,_ uh ,] eighty percent _of the_ homeowners _have been_ robbed , sometime during [their] , [their] [, uh ,] existence [in] [that] neighborhood . 
B|23| B: Wow . That's huge . 
A|24| A: _And_ since [that] _time_ everybody's got some _sort of_ burglar _system_ _or_ [, you know [,] uh ,] burglar alarms [uh , and] including [the] [out] [, uh ,] [the] outer perimeter type [, uh ,] devices , sensors [and] _things_ [like] [that] . 
B|25| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: It's cut back [, you know ,] considerably [, but] [it] , [it] [just] shifts [it] [from] _our_ neighborhood [to] another neighborhood [to] _other_ neighborhood , [so] [it] _still_ [, uh ,] remains [city] wide , pretty , pretty high . 
B|27| B: Are [there] , [are] [there] _any_ theories _on_ why this [is] _happening_ ? 
A|28| A: [Uh [,] _I] would_ [say] [the] majority [of] [it's] [happening] during [the] day [, uh ,] between [probably] ten [in the] morning [and] three [in the] afternoon . 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: Most , 
B|31| B: [But] why ? Why [is] [it] [happening] ? 
A|32| A: _Well ,_ most families , most families [are] young [and] both _people are_ working . 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _So they're_ [happening] during [the] hours _they're_ gone [from] work . 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [Uh ,] [so] [, uh [,] _I] would_ [say that's] [probably] [their] prime motivation . They'll , they'll stock your house _and [,_ uh ,] look at your pattern [and] then go [from] [there] . 
B|37| B: [So they're] _professionals_ ? 
A|38| A: [Uh _,] they_ classify most [of] _them_ as [professionals] . 
B|39| B: Um . 
A|40| A: [Uh [,] you] [get a] few [of] _them_ [that] [are] _a little bit_ sloppier [, uh [,] just] taking [, uh [,] you know [,] just] junk items [that they] _, they_ [can] [just] [get] [, you know ,] ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ _real_ quick . 
B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: Probably [the] biggest items _that [,_ uh ,] _that you_ [get] _in our_ neighborhood , _or_ , _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles , [the] [, you know ,] Mercedes , Volvos , _things [that_ they] [can] [get] [, you know ,] _big_ dollars _for_ [and] [the] jewelry [are] [the] major targets , 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: guns , _that sort [of_ stuff] . 
B|45| B: Um . 
A|46| A: Very few [, you know ,] penny , penny ante [stuff] . 
B|47| B: [Well _,] what_ [do you] _think_ [can] [be] done [to] reduce [that sort of] [crime] ? 
A|48| A: [Well [,] uh ,] [the police] force _, for_ _one [,_ I think] [they] _could_ [, uh ,] definitely add [to] [the police] force [and] [the] type equipment [that they] use [. Uh [,] [it's] ,] oh _, right_ [now] _I think _,_ we_ [are] [about] thirty thousand _people_ [and] _there's_ only eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty _, for_ [that] amount [of] _people_ which [is] [not] very many . 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] _Right ._ 
A|50| A: _And_ , 
B|51| B: [But [,] I mean _,] that's_ [going] [to] tend _to [,_ I mean] [it] seems [to] me [that sort of] approach _will_ tend [to] simply _make_ [the] cost [of] committing [the] [crime] slightly higher [in] [other] words , you've increased [the] probability [of] _somebody_ being _caught_ [a little bit] . The [real] question [is] how [do you] convince [people] [not] [to] commit such [crimes [in] the] first place . 
A|52| A: [Well ,] [the] , course _in our_ particular _state [,_ uh _,] we_ [have] [the] _prison_ overcrowding , whatever , [so] [they're] giving [the] early release [, uh ,] 
B|53| B: _Right ._ They're doing [that] [in our] [state ,] too . 
A|54| A: _Yeah [,_ _and] , and_ [it's [,] I think] [what] [they] need [to] _do is_ stop building more jails [and] start giving stiffer sentences [, uh [,] but] _for the_ , 
B|55| B: [So] [you] _think that_ _would _be a_ deterrent_ ? 
A|56| A: That [would be] , certainly [be a deterrent] . 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: _And_ [, uh ,] [not] necessarily [, you know ,] _give_ [in] [to] [their] [, uh ,] human _rights_ desires _. You know _,_ if_ [they're] overcrowded [, just] keep cramming _them_ [in] [there] till [they] [just] suffocate [. Uh ,] 
B|59| B: [Well _,] what_ [about] an innocent person _who_ happens [to] [have been] found _guilty_ ? 
A|60| A: [Uh [,] I think] they'd [have to] go [to] extra measures [to] [make] sure [a] person's [guilty] [, you know ,] [in] [a lot of] cases . Course _, I , _I_ know_ [you] can't [be a] hundred percent foolproof . 
B|61| B: _Right ._ 
A|62| A: [Uh ,] 
B|63| B: [So] you'd , you'd _rather see it_ _harder_ _to convict somebody_ . 
A|64| A: [I'd] [rather see it] [a little bit] [harder] [and] [have] [a little bit] more evidence [, uh _,] [to_ convict somebody] 
B|65| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [and] then _those_ convicted , especially [of] [, you know ,] murder _and , _and_ [,_ uh [,] you know ,] major [crimes [,] uh _,] to_ reach [the] [life] sentences _and [,_ you know ,] death penalties [and] follow-through [with] [that] . 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] Huh . 
A|68| A: [Uh ,] especially [, you know ,] [in the] case [of] murder 
B|69| B: _Right ._ 
A|70| A: [uh [,] _I] know_ [in] [my] case _, I _,_ my_ wife [and] daughter were kidnapped , during [a] house robbery back [in] eighty-five 
B|71| B: _Oh_ , wow . _Oh_ [, my] goodness . 
A|72| A: [and] _we_ [caught] , [the] individuals got [caught] _, we_ [, uh _,] we_ went through [the] court _system_ [and all] [that _sort of] thing_ 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: _and [,_ uh [,] you know ,] two counts [of] kidnapping [, uh] [you know ,] [the] , [the] forty-five [to] [the] head [, you know [,] just] [the] , [the] _mental anguish_ [and] [the] whole nine yards [uh [,] you know ,] _the guy_ only got five years . 
B|75| B: [Uh-huh .] _Right ._ Wow . 
A|76| A: _And_ [, you know ,] he was [out] within two months [because] _of the_ parole _system_ . [So] [what] [, what] , 
B|77| B: Did [you ,] did [you] sue _him_ under [the] civil [system] ? 
A|78| A: Do [what] [now] ? 
B|79| B: Did [you] sue _him_ under [the] civil [system] ? 
A|80| A: _no_ . [I'm] [not] [real] familiar [with] [that] . 
B|81| B: [Well [,] _you] could_ [probably] sue _him_ [for] [mental anguish] [or] _something_ [, [right] [,] and] _try to_ [get] _money_ [from] _him_ 
A|82| A: [Oh] . 
B|83| B: [and ,] 
A|84| A: [Well ,] [the] insurance companies [and all] [that] tried [to ,] tried [to] go after [him] [and] [they] said [, well [,] you know ,] he , [they're] , he has _no_ _job_ , he has nothing _, there's_ nothing [that] he has _that ,_ _that [you_ could] go after . 
B|85| B: _Yeah ._ Makes [you] wish [that] _had_ [, uh ,] [still] _had_ indentured servitude [, for] this [sort of thing] . 
A|86| A: [Yeah [.] Uh ,] very 
B|87| B: [But] [they] [give] [the guy] [a] [job] [in] [prison] [and] [make] [him] _pay_ his damn debt . 
A|88| A: [Yeah .] They [don't] [do] [that] _here_ . Course [they] [pay] _them_ [, but] [they] [don't] [, you] [don't] [, you] [or] [the] insurance companies never [see] [any] [of] [that] [money] . 
B|89| B: _Yeah , that's_ too [bad .] 
A|90| A: _And_ [, uh [,] you _know ,] and_ [they're] [right] [now] [they're] reluctant [to] go after [him] [because] [they're] [, you know ,] [they're] , [they're] repeat offenders _, they_ [, uh ,] [been] [in] jail before 
B|91| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|92| A: they've [been] released [, you know ,] several times , which [is] another [, uh ,] deal [I] hate _to see_ . 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [But [,] uh [,] you know ,] [basically] [the guy] commits [, you know] three major [crimes] _and , [and_ [,] uh , and] car theft [on] top [of] [it] , destroys [my] car , 
B|95| B: _Yeah [, I_ [, I] think] [that's] [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: [and] _we're_ [out] [, you know [,] uh [,] you know ,] [fifteen] thousand dollars [and [,] you know ,] [the guy] gets [out in] two months 
B|97| B: That's awful 
A|98| A: [and] he goes [out] [and] commits [it] again . Fact , he's back [in] jail [now] . [So] [, what] [, what] [, uh ,] 
B|99| B: Gives [you] sympathy [for the] vigilantes . 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] What [, what] [deterrent] does he really [have] ? 
B|101| B: [Yeah .] 
A|102| A: [Yeah [, I] think] [in our] , [in our] particular neighborhood , vigilantism [is] becoming [a] [real] , [real] possibility . 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [Uh ,] we've [had] [a] couple instances [where] _break_ ins [where] [the] [people] [have] [actually] [, you know ,] _shot_ [the] [people] 
B|105| B: [Oh] [, my] God . 
A|106| A: [and [,] uh ,] return offenders [have] , they've [actually] waited [for] _them_ [, where] they've robbed [, you know ,] particular neighborhood , they'll rob [one] house , then [other] [people] [will] wait up [, you _know ,] and_ wait [for] [somebody] [to] [do] [something] else , [try to] take [it] [in] [their] own hands . 
B|107| B: _Right ._ 
A|108| A: Course [it] doesn't always work [out in] [their] favor . 
B|109| B: _Right ._ 
A|110| A: [But [,] uh ,] nevertheless [, I think] _people are_ [just] _getting_ fed up [and] saying [, you know [,] you] can't arrest [all] [of] us , 
B|111| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: _you can_ [, you know [,] _you] can_ [get] some [of] us , 
B|113| B: _Right ._ 
A|114| A: [you] can't [get] [all] [of] us . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [Uh [,] and] _we're_ beginning _to see_ more [and] more [of] [that] . 
B|117| B: [And] [that _,] that's_ [a deterrent] , too . If [you] [think] [the] home owner might [be] armed [, [right] [,] and] awake 
A|118| A: [Yeah .] 
B|119| B: [here] [you] [break] _in , and_ [you're] [going] [to] [get] [shot] . 
A|120| A: [Yeah , that's] [, I mean] [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in ,] [in _,] we_ [have] [had] [a] few cases [where] [the guy] has broken [in [,] you know ,] during [the] middle _of the_ night [and] gotten himself [shot] [to] death . 
B|121| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [And] [, uh ,] [it] helps [for] [a] while 
B|123| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: [but] then [just] another different set [of] [people] come [in , and] most _of the_ _people are_ transients [from] [out] , outside _of the_ [state] . 
B|125| B: Huh . 
A|126| A: [Uh [,] _I] would_ [say probably] eighty percent [of] _them_ [that] [are] [caught] , [they're] [from] places [like] up [in] Oklahoma [, and] Louisiana , Arkansas [, you know ,] across [the] , [the] border . 
B|127| B: Wow , 
A|128| A: [So] [, you know ,] [people] [who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in our] town [or] whatever 
B|129| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|130| A: [it's not] many [from] [the] local communities . 
B|131| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|132| A: [But [,] uh [,] it's] [a] problem _, and [I_ , I] [just] [, [I think] that] [the] court systems need [to] [be] more accurate [in ,] [in ,] stiffer [in] [their] penalties , 
B|133| B: [Yeah .] 
A|134| A: [would be a] definite [deterrent] _and , [and_ [,] uh ,] giving [the] [, uh ,] [police] [, uh ,] agencies [a little bit] more jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] when [they] , when [they] catch _these people_ . 
B|135| B: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh [.] [I] mean [,] I , I] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. [I] think [,] uh [,] what] [I would] [like] [to see] [is ,] number [one ,] completely [getting] rid [of] [these] victimless [crimes] [. Uh [,] there's] [no] reason [to] enforce [those] [and] spend [time] [and] [money] doing [it] [and , and] worry [about] [these] [things] [where] [people are] [getting] hurt . 
A|136| A: [Right .] 
B|137| B: [And] [I think] [one] [of the] [big] [things [that] [you] can] [do [is] [,] to] increase deterrence [is [,] uh [,] if] someone [is] found [guilty] [of] [a] [, uh ,] felony level offense [, they] lose [their] citizenship . [And] [they] lose [their] constitutional [rights] [. You know ,] 
A|138| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|139| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] [things that] [we're] trying [to] worry [about [,] you know ,] protecting [these people] [from] [, we] [just] [don't] protect [them] . 
A|140| A: _I know_ [like] [in] [my] wife's case [, they] made her feel [like] [the] criminal . 
B|141| B: [I [know] [, and] [I] think [,] I think] [that's] ridiculous . 
A|142| A: They [, they] went [to] [all] , [all] ...
