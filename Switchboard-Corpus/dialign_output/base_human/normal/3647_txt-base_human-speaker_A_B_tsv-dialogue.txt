B|1| B: Hi , fine , _I'm_ _Nancy [._ How are you] ? 
A|2| A: Great , [Nancy .] 
B|3| B: _I'm_ _in Plano also_ 
A|4| A: You're [in Plano also] , huh ? 
B|5| B: _Yes ,_ _we're_ _not_ too long distance [today] . 
A|6| A: _Well ,_ _good_ _to_ hear _. I_ _was_ _just_ talking _to_ someone _the_ _other_ day from Pennsylvania . 
B|7| B: _Oh _,_ that was_ _good ._ _Utah_ , I've _had a_ couple _of _,_ but_ _that was_ it . 
A|8| A: Really ? 
B|9| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|10| A: All right _. Well ,_ [good] _to_ hear , [good] _to_ hear . 
B|11| B: Learned _about_ their basketball team 
A|12| A: Which one ? 
B|13| B: Uh , _Jazz ._ 
A|14| A: _Oh , yeah ._ 
B|15| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|16| A: The [Utah] [Jazz .] 
B|17| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|18| A: _Yeah ,_ they're , they're pretty [good .] They've got some [good] [good] , some [good] , uh , [good] players out there . 
B|19| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|20| A: _Well ,_ [you] ready _for_ New Year's Eve ? 
B|21| B: [I] am . 
A|22| A: Good . Should we , uh , start this _so_ we _can_ , 
B|23| B: _Okay_ . 
A|24| A: What [was] your name again ? 
B|25| B: [Nancy .] 
A|26| A: [Nancy] , _that's_ right , 
B|27| B: _Right ._ 
A|28| A: _and I'm_ Brian . 
B|29| B: _Right ._ 
A|30| A: Just [a] moment [Okay] [Nancy] , _then _I_ guess_ _the_ , today's subject _is_ _benefits_ [in] _the_ _job_ _other_ _than_ salary . 
B|31| B: _Right ._ 
A|32| A: What , uh _what_ _do_ [you] feel [are] important _to_ [you] _or_ _other people_ _as_ , _as_ crucial _benefits_ ? 
B|33| B: _Uh-huh [._ Well ,] [I'm] [a] little _different_ [than] [other people] _because _I_ don't have_ [benefits] _with_ _my job_ . 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [I'm] [a] nurse _and I_ _work ,_ 
A|36| A: [Oh] 
B|37| B: [I] float _so _that_ I_ _have_ no [benefits] except higher pay [for] [doing] _that_ . 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh _.] _Right_ . Uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: So [I] find _that_ it makes up [for] [what] [I] pay [for] _insurance_ _and _I_ , I_ _make_ enough money _by_ [the] _hour_ _to make_ up [for] _that_ . 
A|40| A: To , [to] compensate [for] some [of] [the] [benefits] . 
B|41| B: [Right . Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [Oh] . 
B|43| B: [Yeah ,] it's cheaper [for] me [to] buy _insurance_ _by_ [the] month [than] [to] _work_ staff someplace . 
A|44| A: [Yes] . 
B|45| B: _And_ [then I] _have_ _my_ freedom [. _I] can_ _work_ seven _days_ _in a_ row [and] take _a week_ off [or] whatever [I] want _to do_ . 
A|46| A: [Well [,] that] , _that's_ an excellent , [so] actually [that] _is_ [a] benefit , uh , 
B|47| B: [Well ,] it [is] [to] me . Most [people] prefer [the] security [of] _nine_ [to] five _, and_ weekends off [and] knowing [that] their _insurance_ [is] paid [and] their _retirement_ , 
A|48| A: [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: [and I'm] [just] _really_ _not_ interested [in] all [that] . 
A|50| A: [Right _.] Right _,_ well_ _I guess_ _that's_ [a] [good] point , uh , 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [I] [do] belong [to] [a] , [a] large corporation [or] [my] [, that] where [I'm] currently employed [and] there's , uh , there's some [different] things , uh , one [that] you've already mentioned [is] , [is] health [insurance] [. _I] think_ through our health [insurance] [that [I] can] get better rates _as_ [a] , through [a] group plan _as_ opposed [to] going out [and] getting health [insurance] on an individual basis [because I] [had] [to do] [that] at one time when [I] wasn't employed [with] [a] large corporation 
B|53| B: [Right .] 
A|54| A: [and] [that] got [to] be somewhat expensive , [so] [I] _I think_ one [of] [the] [benefits] [I , I] see [is] [the] , uh , [is] [the] group , uh , group discount . 
B|55| B: [Yeah [.] Right _,] and_ especially _if_ [you] _have a family_ . 
A|56| A: [Yes] . 
B|57| B: Then [I think] it makes [a] big difference . 
A|58| A: [Yes [,] and] _that's_ , _that's_ one _thing_ [I] [do] [have] . 
B|59| B: [Yeah .] 
A|60| A: If [I] didn't [have a family] [, [I] don't] [think] [I] would [have] , _as_ , _as_ [a] male [or] _as_ [a] , _as_ an individual [of ,] [in] this stage [of] [my] life [, [I] don't] [think] [I] would [have] [insurance] , uh , [other] , 
B|61| B: [Right .] 
A|62| A: [I don't] [think] [I] would go through [that] expense . One [other] benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous [job] [, I] [really] enjoyed [because] they [had] [what] [was] called flex schedule where [I] could go [and I] could [work ,] uh , [nine] [hour] [days] [and] [have] _like_ Friday only [work] four hours 
B|63| B: [Oh , yeah .] 
A|64| A: [or] [I] could [do] , uh , [work] four [days] [a week] at ten hours [a] day [and] [have a] , [you] know , three day weekend . [And] [make] , uh , [make] [my job] flexible [in] [that] case . 
B|65| B: [Right .] Could [you] change [that] [as] [you] felt [like] it [or] did [you] [have] [to do] it _the same_ _every_ [week] ? 
A|66| A: [Well ,] basically [, yeah] [I] [had] [to do] [, that] , uh , [the same] , uh , [for] [about] [every] quarter [of] [the] year [. I] mean uh , [because I] [was] [in a] , [in a] position [of] management [I] [had] responsibilities over [people] [that] , uh [, I] needed [to make] [my] schedule , uh , [so that] [if] [I] [was] [not] there [I] would [have] coverage [by] some [other] management personnel , 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: _so ,_ [so] [I , [I] think] [that] , uh [, that was] [a] [, that was] an excellent benefit [that I] [really] enjoyed 
B|69| B: [Yeah .] 
A|70| A: [and [I] don't have] [that] [in] [my] current operation [, but] , uh , [you] mentioned , uh , flexible [work] schedule [and] _that's_ , _that's_ [good .] 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: [And] , uh , [what] [other] [benefits] [do] [you] [think] [are] important ? 
B|73| B: [Oh [,] well] [, [I] guess] , _retirement_ [, that] kind [of] [thing] _which_ [I don't] worry much [about] [so] 
A|74| A: [Yeah [,] yeah] , _that's_ true . 
B|75| B: [I] [just] prefer [to] worry [about] [today] , probably [not] [a] practical attitude [but] [that's] who [I] am [so ,] 
A|76| A: [Well [,] and] [that's] an individual [thing] . 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [Yeah ,] [with] , uh , [with] our current , uh , organization , we [do] [have a] nice [retirement] package [and] [also] [a] , [a] nice [thing] [that] [, that] we [have] [in] our corporation [is] [a] , uh , [is] [a] profit sharing plan where we [can] , uh , participate [in] [the] , [the] profits [of] [the] company . If [we're] , [you] know , [if] we've been there [a] while [and] [we're] vested , uh , [which] means [that] , [you] know , we [have a] , an interest , uh , [in] [the] company [that] we [can] , uh , get some [of] [the] [benefits] [of] [the] , either [the] profit high times [or] , [or] [in a] sense , suffer during [the] low times 
B|79| B: [Right .] 
A|80| A: [and] , uh , [also] , uh , [in] one [of] [my] wife's , uh , companies where she worked , they'd [had a] real nice profit sharing plan [that] [, that] ,
