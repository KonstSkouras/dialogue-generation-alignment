A|0| A: _Hello_ Ann . 
B|1| B: [Hello] Chuck . 
A|2| A: _Uh _,_ _the_ other_ _day _,_ I_ attended _a_ _conference_ here _at_ Utah State University _on_ recycling 
B|3| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|4| A: _and , uh , I_ _was_ kind _of_ interested _to_ hear cause _they_ had _some_ people _from_ _the E P A_ _and_ lots _of_ different places 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and , uh ,_ _they_ had basically decided _that_ there _is_ going _to be_ _a_ real _problem_ here within _a_ few years _on_ solid _waste_ . 
B|7| B: _Uh , I_ _didn't_ think _that _was_ a_ _new_ revelation . 
A|8| A: _Well , it's_ not too [new] . 
B|9| B: Right _. So_ , _what_ _what_ [is] [the E P A] recommending _now_ ? 
A|10| A: _Oh_ , _they_ _really_ [didn't] propose any solutions . Actually , _they_ were _, the_ guy [was] pretty negative _about_ [the] _things_ [that] [the] government [was] _doing_ _even_ _though_ he [was] _from_ [the E P A] . 
B|11| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: But , he had [a] lot _of_ _, uh ,_ facts _to_ , _to_ give _and , uh ,_ _things like_ how many solid _waste_ plants were being shut down _and ,_ _and , uh ,_ _one_ _of _the_ most interesting_ _things_ [that] he [was] talking _about_ [was] recycling _of_ , _of_ news print . He [was] talking _about_ _, uh , the_ City _of_ _New York and_ how _they_ went _and_ collected _all_ this news print 
B|13| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|14| A: _and_ _they_ could sell _it_ _for_ _a while_ . They were able _to_ sell _it_ _for_ _some_ amount per ton _and_ [now] _at_ this stage _of the_ game where _they_ have gotten into recycling , they've collected _so_ much news print [that] _they_ have _to_ pay _to_ have _it_ hauled away . 
B|15| B: Right . That's [a] , that's [a] common [problem] [though] . That [it] seems , [that] has happened _in_ Dallas _as_ _well_ _as_ [New York and] [I] try [to] recycle [all] [of the] newspapers [that] come [to] my house [and] after [a while] [I] _just_ quit taking [the] newspaper because [I] couldn't recycle [it] anymore which isn't good [for] _business_ [on] [the other] end either [, I] suppose . 
A|16| A: [Yeah .] We're _doing_ _some_ here [in] , [in] Cash Valley _, the_ community here . 
B|17| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|18| A: There's _, uh ,_ we've actually got [a] kind [of] [a] nice set up . We've got [a] couple [of] plants here [that] actually take _, uh ,_ _recycled_ paper [and] shred [it] [and] spray [it] _with_ chemical treatment _so that_ _it's_ not [a] fire hazard [and] make [it] into insulation 
B|19| B: Right . 
A|20| A: [and] _they_ can actually use [as] much _recycled_ paper [as] [the] community can get [to] them . Because _they are_ actually buying [it] [and] shipping _it in_ _from_ outside . 
B|21| B: [Well ,] that's good . 
A|22| A: [So] _one_ [of the] real keys , [it] sounds _like_ , [to] getting recycling [for] _, uh ,_ paper or something _like that_ [to] go [is] [to] get _some sort_ [of] [business] [to] actually want [it] once _you_ have collected _it ._ 
B|23| B: Right _. There_ has [to be] [, uh ,] [a] reuse [for] [it .] [I] mean , that's why [they] recycle . The [one] [I] think [is] [the most interesting] [is] [with] [the] [recycled] bottles [and] [all] [that] [, uh , the] industry seems [to be] [doing] [with] [the] [recycled] polymers _. Uh ,_ everything [from] [, uh ,] [waste] baskets [to] carpet _to the_ _no_ stick [, I] mean [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [and , uh , I] think [they are] [even] _putting_ [it in] [the] roadways these days [and] they're making clothes [now] [that] [are] [recycled] . Like [the] [recycled] _plastic_ coke bottles [and] [and] milk cartons [and] [things _like] that ._ 
A|26| A: And there [was a] paper presented _at_ this _conference_ [from] [a] guy [from] Alabama [and] he [was] kind [of] hired [to] do [a] study by two departments [for] [the] government . One [was] [like] , environmental protection [and] [the other] [one] [was] , oh [, I] can't remember [what] _, but_ [the] basic idea , [it] [was] presented [to] him [was] how can we maximize [the] amount [of] energy [that] we can get back [from] recycling [and] minimize [the] volume [of] stuff [that] we [are] [putting] into our landfill 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and [, uh ,] the] solution [that] he came up [with] [for] plastics , [and] [it] [was] _really_ quite amazing , he says , [well] [the] best thing [to] do [with] plastics [is] [to] burn them . 
B|29| B: [Oh] [really] . 
A|30| A: He came [to the] conclusion , plastics [is] actually [one] [of the] biggest problems [in] landfills cause _it's_ _, it's_ low weight _, but_ _it's_ high volume _so_ [it] takes up [a] lot [of] space 
B|31| B: Right . 
A|32| A: [and] there's almost [no] energy , there's very little energy value [in] actually [doing] [a] lot [of the] recycling _, but_ there [is] [a] lot [of] energy [in] [it] if _you_ can burn [it] [and] use [it] , produce electricity . 
B|33| B: Huh . 
A|34| A: [So] his solution [was] [to] burn [plastic] . Collect [it] [and] burn [it .] 
B|35| B: [Well , it's] carbon [so that] makes sense , [like] [a] carbon fuel [of] [some sort] [, but] [what] [what] [about] emissions ? 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] And [it's] more than [even] paper or something [like that [.] There] [is] more energy [in] [it] per pound or whatever _. Well_ [that was] he [didn't] deal [with] [that .] 
B|37| B: [Oh] . 
A|38| A: He [just] said burn [it .] 
B|39| B: Okay 
A|40| A: He [didn't] talk [about] cleaning [it] up or _anything_ [like that [.] So] [it's] not very practical 
B|41| B: No [. Well] [it's] _interesting ._ [I] bet [that [was] a] good [day ,] [at] [the] yeah , [conference] then . 
A|42| A: [Yeah] , [well] , real [interesting .] 
B|43| B: Did [it] change [anything] [for] [you] ? 
A|44| A: [Uh ,] not too much [. [Uh ,] I] got [a] bit . Actually ,
