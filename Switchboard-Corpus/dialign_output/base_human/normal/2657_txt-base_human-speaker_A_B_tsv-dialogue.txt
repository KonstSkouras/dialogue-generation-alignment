A|0| A: Huh ? _Okay ._ 
B|1| B: _I don't know_ _how_ much _I know_ _about_ _this_ subject 
A|2| A: _Well _,_ I don't know_ _if_ [I know] _anything_ _or_ _not_ , 
B|3| B: _Yeah_ . 
A|4| A: _but_ I've , I've _got_ _some_ opinions _on_ _it ._ 
B|5| B: [Okay .] Go ahead . 
A|6| A: See those _type of_ _people _that_ _,_ _that_ have_ _the_ most opinions , ones _that_ [don't know] _anything_ 
B|7| B: _Yeah_ 
A|8| A: "Well _, uh ,_ I've had teenagers _and I_ _now_ _have_ grandchildren _that are_ teenagers _, _and_ _I_ don't know _that_ it_ _might_ _do_ _them_ _a little_ bit _of_ _good_ _to see_ _the_ world _from_ _a_ different perspective . Uh _, I think_ [this] ""me"" generation has gone _far_ too _far_ _. And_ _the_ young _people_ _are_ overly impressed _. And_ _I think _it_ wouldn't_ hurt _them_ _to_ step _back_ _from_ _themselves_ _just_ slightly _and_ _see_ things _from_ _a_ _far_ _more_ disadvantaged viewpoint . " 
B|9| B: _That's_ true . 
A|10| A: Uh _, I_ personally [know] nothing [about] _the Peace Corps_ though . 
B|11| B: _Um ,_ me _either _._ I , I_ went [to] _college and_ then started working [and] then [got] married _and ,_ 
A|12| A: _But_ _they _have_ [,_ I] read somewhere _, and I'm_ , _I'm_ _out_ _on_ _a_ limb _here _,_ some_ _type of_ _college _,_ uh ,_ volunteer _work for_ teachers _, _that_ they_ _are_ straight _out_ _of_ [college _and] they_ _do_ _one year_ _of_ volunteer _work_ teaching _in _the_ _,_ uh ,_ _lower income_ brackets _of _the_ United States ._ Have _you_ ever heard [about] _that_ _one_ ? 
B|13| B: _No [,_ I] haven't [, [I] _know] that [,_ uh ,] _my_ sister [, _I] _have_ a_ twin sister [and] _when_ [they] graduated _she_ went [to] [, uh ,] _teach_ _in a_ _small_ town down [in] south Texas [and [I] _know] [,_ that] _like_ _if you_ [have] [college] notes _, if you_ _teach_ _in a_ [lower income] bracket _where they_ [don't] pay _as_ much [and they] cancel part [of] your _, you know ,_ your [college] note [or] whatever . 
A|14| A: Oh _, really_ ? 
B|15| B: Uh-huh . If _it's_ _like _,_ you know [,_ _really] a _,_ you know ,_ [a] [lower] paying job _, you know _,_ where_ _in a_ _small_ town [you] [don't] obviously [you] [don't] need _as_ much _as_ [far] _as_ [to] _, you know _,_ to_ live . 
A|16| A: _And_ [this] _is_ _money_ [that] she's borrowed [to] form her [college] education ? 
B|17| B: _Yeah ,_ _she_ only taught _there_ [one year] _but _I_ ,_ 
A|18| A: _But_ [she] [got] credits _for_ _it_ ? 
B|19| B: Uh-huh . 
A|20| A: [That's] very interesting . 
B|21| B: _And _,_ um [,_ _I think] it would_ _be_ [, [I] [know] that] also _one of_ _my_ cousins who [, uh ,] _he_ [is] [in] _like the_ therapy [type] _thing_ [and] _he_ _was _,_ um [,_ some] group paid part [of] _his_ [college] [income] [but] then _he_ _was_ _required_ [to] _go_ [back] [and] [work for] [a] _certain_ number [of] _years_ [in] [this] town _at_ [, uh [,] uh [,] I] mean _, it's a_ nursing home _or something like that ._ 
A|22| A: Huh . 
B|23| B: _So _,_ you know , if [,_ _I think] that's _a_ good_ _way_ [for] [people] [to] _, you know ,_ _maybe_ get [people] [to] _come_ [back] [to] these _small towns_ [to] [work] by helping [people that] normally [might] [not] _be_ able [to] _go_ [to] [college and] get [the] [type of] degree [they] _want_ . 
A|24| A: _Yeah [, _I_ think] that_ [is] an excellent program [, _I] really_ _do_ [. I] [like that _.] And_ _it's [,_ it's] beneficial [to] [the] [small towns] too _because_ , [they] [really] [, really] _have ,_ [have a] disadvantage [that] we _wouldn't_ understand _because_ _we're_ _in the_ Metroplex . 
B|25| B: [Yeah] . As [far] _as_ yeah , getting doctors _and all_ [that] stuff , yeah . 
A|26| A: _Right [,_ you know , if [,] if] we had [some] [really] major health problem [that] [required] [a] specialist , we _could_ _find_ [one] _it wouldn't_ [be] convenient , 
B|27| B: [Yeah] . 
A|28| A: [but] we _could_ _find_ [one] . 
B|29| B: Uh-huh . 
A|30| A: We _wouldn't_ _have to_ drive _and spend_ [the] night someplace [or something like that .] 
B|31| B: [Yeah] . 
A|32| A: [So _,] I , I_ _can_ _see_ [the] advantage [to] [that] [one] . The _Peace Corps_ itself [is] [really a [,] uh ,] dying _out_ , isn't [it] ? 
B|33| B: [I really] [don't know that] much [about] [it] [, you know [,] _I _, I] ,_ I think_ [of [the] Peace Corps] [, you know ,] _more _like_ the_ _sixties_ [and] [that] _kind of_ stuff _when_ , 
A|34| A: It's still [in] existence . 
B|35| B: [Yeah] [. And] [don't] _they go into other countries and_ stuff ? 
A|36| A: [I] _want to_ believe [they go into other countries and] [teach] _them_ _how _to_ do_ things [like] farm [, uh ,] dig their _own_ wells , set _up_ , their schools . 
B|37| B: Uh-huh . Things [that] make [the ,] yeah . Make [them] [more] self-supporting ? 
A|38| A: Yes . They , 
B|39| B: [Yeah] . 
A|40| A: It's [not] [a] program [to] [teach] [them] [to] use [the] American _money_ [, it's a] program [to] [teach] [them] _to be_ [more] self-reliant . 
B|41| B: _Right ._ [Yeah] . 
A|42| A: [And ,] yes , you're right [, I think] [it's a] [sixties] program [. [I] think it] [was] [one of] Kennedy's hot _points_ [that] [he] [, that] [was] [his] big deal . 
B|43| B: [But] [it] definitely _would_ _give_ _a lot_ [of the] kids _now [that_ have] everything given [to] [them] [that they] [want [to] see] _what_ [it's] [like] _if you_ [don't] [have] _all the_ [money] [and] can't [have] _what_ _you want_ _when_ _you want_ [it .] 
A|44| A: [Right .] [Right .] [Um [,] I think] [I ,] I've singled _out_ [my] grandchildren [and] [but] actually _they're_ , _they're_ pretty [good] , along those lines [as] compared [to] [what] [I have] seen _from_ [other] people's children [and] grandchildren , mine _aren't_ [really] [that] _bad_ , 
B|45| B: Uh-huh . 
A|46| A: [but] [at] [the] same time [I think it would] _do_ [them] [a] world [of] [good] . 
B|47| B: [Yeah] . 
A|48| A: [But] _there's_ [a ,] 
B|49| B: [I don't] [, [I don't know] that] _you could_ require everyone [to] , [do] [that] [for] , yeah _, to do_ [it] [for] [a] whole [year] , [or] two _years_ [or something like [that] ,] 
A|50| A: Mandatory _just [like_ ,] [like the] draft . [No] . 
B|51| B: [I don't know that] [that] [would] [work] [if ,] somebody's , _was ,_ didn't [really] [want [to] be] _there and_ didn't [have ,] 
A|52| A: Every time [you] , They [could] buy their [way] _out_ . 
B|53| B: [Yeah , I] mean _, there_ [would] [be] loopholes [just like] _there_ [is] [in] _anything else_ 
A|54| A: _Right [,_ you know ,] [they] , _they'd_ figure [a] [way] around [that] [one] [in a] heartbeat . [But] , _I'm_ wondering [if] _there's_ another issue _here _,_ and_ [maybe] [this] [is] why [this] has died _out_ . Can [you] [go into] _, and_ [this] wasn't [the] question [but] _it's _,_ it_ may [be] [the] _more of the_ issue versus should young adults , _can_ [they go] [in] [there and] _can_ anyone [go into] , well , _out_ [of the] Kurdish _community_ [is] _a little_ bit extreme [at] [this] time _, but_ say [, I think] Bangladesh [would] [have] been [a good] example [or] [some] [, some] [really] desperate situation [and] [teach] [them] [to] farm [and] [teach] [them] [and] [it] doesn't [do] any [good] . 
B|55| B: [Yeah] . 
A|56| A: [I don't know _that] it_ does [. [I , I] ,] [don't [know that] [,] um [,] if you] step [back] _from_ [the] current issue [and] look [at] [it] [more] intellectually [, there] _are_ forever over , [as] long [as] we [know] [there] _are_ races [of] _people that are_ dropping _out_ . 
B|57| B: [Yeah] . 
A|58| A: You [know _,] we're_ losing [certain] , races [of] [people] . 
B|59| B: Uh-huh . 
A|60| A: _There_ _are_ [people] [now _that] are_ obsolete point [and] fact _just ,_ [just like] endangered species [of] animals , so [there] _are_ quote tribes [of] _people [,_ _that] are_ endangered [or] obsolete . 
B|61| B: Uh-huh . 
A|62| A: [And] _I'm_ [just] wondering [if] you're fighting [a] natural process [there] [of] being winnowed _out_ . There's [a] German word [for] [it] [that's] elegant _, [but_ I] never _can_ remember [what] [it] [was [,] uh _,] _but_ _,_ but_ [that] _they're_ , _they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ [, [where] they] _are_ _they're_ [not] adapted [to] their environment essentially . 
B|63| B: [Right ,] yeah . 
A|64| A: [Um _,] and_ [one [of] the] quick examples [is] [the] Aborigines . 
B|65| B: [Yeah ,] uh-huh . 
A|66| A: Uh _, when_ we _were_ [in] Australia [, uh ,] sad _little_ things . Uh [, I] felt sorry [for] [them] . Because their society isn't [there] anymore _, and_ their belief system [and all] their structured [of] theirs , [all the] structures [of] their society _are_ gone , essentially . 
B|67| B: [Yeah] . 
A|68| A: [And] _they're_ [just] [kind of] [more like] [a] side show _than_ [anything else] _and that's_ sad . 
B|69| B: [Yeah] . 
A|70| A: [But] [I don't] [think] _there's_ any [way] [you could] [go] [, uh ,] [the Peace Corps] [could] [go] [in] [and] rescue those _people _,_ [and_ [I] don't] [think] [you could] [have] done [it] fifty [or] [a] hundred [years] ago [either .] 
B|71| B: [Yeah] . 
A|72| A: [So [,] I ,] _I'm_ wondering [if] [the Peace Corps] [is] [, really] an effective tool . 
B|73| B: [Well ,] Down [here] _with_ [the Peace Corps] [we're] talking [about] [all] these [people that] [aren't] even [in] _our own_ country [when] [there's] _enough_ [people] [here] [that] [I think] probably need help _and ,_ [could] [be] helped . 
A|74| A: Good point . We've [got] [enough] without without [a] passport [there's] plenty . 
B|75| B: [Yeah] . 
A|76| A: Yes [. [I] think] we ought [to] worry [about] [our own] species . 
B|77| B: [And] [maybe] rather [than] [just ,] require somebody [to] join [like [the] Peace Corps] [for] [a] [year] [maybe] [like [,] um ,] during [college [,] you know ,] [maybe] [have] [some] [kind of] course [where] [they'd] [be] [required] [to do] [some] [kind of] [community] service [type] [work] [, and] help [people] [in] [that] area [or] [people] [in [the] United States .] 
A|78| A: [I] wonder [now] [in] [, and] I've been _out_ [of] school too long [to] _answer_ [this] _, [but_ I] wonder [if] [there] [aren't] [some] sociology courses . 
B|79| B: [There] probably [are] [, you know ,] [for] [but] [I'm] sure _, that's_ probably [like] [people that] [do] [that are] , [are] [the] [people that are] _going to_ [go into] social [work] [and] stuff [but [I] think [that] [it] wouldn't] [really] [be] half [bad] [for] everybody [not] [to do] [something] [, you know [,] and] realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to] [, um ,] help these [people [,] you know [,] and I'm] [not] saying [just] _give them_ [money] [but [,] I] mean , [because] [they [have] [to] be] taught [to be] , 
A|80| A: [That's] [the] last [thing] [you want] [, to do] . 
B|81| B: [Yeah] [I] mean [, [I] know] [that's] [what] [my] father-in-law [was] talking [about] [, you know [,] when] _you give_ these [people] [money] [or] _, what_ [was] [it] [they] [were] bringing [up] [points] asking [as] [far] [as] whether [they] need [to] _give_ [, um ,] [more] [money] [to] these [people [,] I] mean [, [and] that's] [not] [really] [the] [answer] [, I] mean , [because] [if] [they're] alcoholics they'll [just] [go] [out] [and spend] [, it] _on [,_ you know ,] booze [or something like [that] ,] 
A|82| A: [Yeah [,] that's] exactly [it .] 
B|83| B: [but] . 
A|84| A: They're [not] [going to] take [that] [money] [you [give] them] [and] [go] try [to] figure [out] [a] [way] [to] dry [out] [with] [it .] Now [come] [on ,] let's [be] realistic , 
B|85| B: [Yeah] . 
A|86| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|87| B: Or [, you know [,] to] [find] [a] job [where they] [can] learn [how to] support [themselves] , 
A|88| A: [Right .] 
B|89| B: [I] mean [, I] guess [we're] getting [kind of] off [the] subject , [here [,] but] . 
A|90| A: [No _,] we're_ [not] [I don't] [think] [. [I] think] [, that's] [more] realistic [than] making [them] [go] [in [the] Peace Corps] . 
B|91| B: [Yeah , I] mean [it's ,] True . [Yeah] . 
A|92| A: [I think that's [a] lot] [more] realistic . Uh [, I , [I think] that] we should [be] spending [more] time [and [,] and] again [I don't] [think] [the ,] [the Peace Corps] [is] , [is] [as] successful [now] simply [because] [it's] [not] . It doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|93| B: [Yeah] . 
A|94| A: Uh , we've [got] plenty , [in] fact , we've [got] [far] too many . You're [in] [, uh [,] what] _Flower Mound_ ? 
B|95| B: [Flower Mound] , yeah . [So [,] we're] [a little] [you know ,] farther removed [from] [like] Dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas [where they] probably [have] [more of the] homeless [and] [that] [type of] [thing] . 
A|96| A: [I] [was [,] that's] exactly [what] [I] [was] [going to] ask [you] . Have [you] ever , [have ,] [have] [you] been downtown
