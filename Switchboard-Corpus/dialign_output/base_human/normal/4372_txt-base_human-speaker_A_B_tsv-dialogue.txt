B|0| B: So , let's talk _about_ _the _,_ uh ,_ wonderful abuses _in the_ State _of_ _Pennsylvania_ _of_ personal property _taxes_ whereby _you_ _can_ purchase _something mail order and_ after _the_ fact _, the_ State _of_ _Pennsylvania_ _can_ _find out about it_ _and_ send _you_ _a_ bill _for_ _the sales tax_ appropriate _to_ _that_ item _that_ _you_ purchased as _well_ as interest _and_ _penalties_ _from_ _the_ time _that_ _you_ bought _it ._ What _do_ _you_ _think_ ? Is _Pennsylvania_ kind _of_ _out of line_ _there_ ? 
A|1| A: _Well ,_ actually _, I don't think_ they're [out of line] . Devil's advocate possibly _, but_ [it] _, you_ _are_ trying [to] avoid _paying_ [taxes] [and] whether or _not_ [you] agree _with that_ _law_ , _you're_ still circumventing [it .] You _are_ legal [in] , [in] your circumvention [of] [that] _law_ . 
B|2| B: What , _what_ _if_ [you're] [not] doing [it] _in order to_ circumvent _the_ [law] though ? _I mean_ _what_ _if you_ [don't] even _realize_ [that] [you're] subject [to] [paying] _, uh ,_ income _tax on_ _something_ [that] [you] purchase _mail order_ ? 
A|3| A: Really _, _I_ , _I_ _, I_ don't think_ _that's_ [a] valid argument _. _I_ think that_ most people _are_ quite aware they're [not] [paying] [that] _six percent_ [sales tax] . Um , naturally _some_ , _some_ _things_ [you] just _can't find_ [in] your _local_ K-Mart or , or [, uh ,] Bryn Mawr stereo dealer _. Uh , but_ _then_ why [not] _pay_ , _pay_ [the sales tax] Corporations have [to] , why should an individual just _because_ _it's_ , just _because_ _the state_ _can't_ really [find out about it] , _be_ able [to] avoid _paying _sales tax_ ?_ 
B|4| B: [Well _,] I mean _,_ it_ seems [to] me _that ,_ generally , _at_ least [in] _my_ own experience , when [I] purchase _something _mail order_ _,_ it's not_ [to] circumvent [paying sales tax] [to] [the] State [of] _Pennsylvania ._ It's [because] , _I'm_ sorry _, the_ Commonwealth [of] _Pennsylvania ._ 
A|5| A: Yes . 
B|6| B: [Uh _,] it's_ [because] [I , I] [can't find] [the] item _that I_ want _at_ [a] competitive price anywhere [in] _my_ [local] area . So [I] go outside [the] area _for_ _that _._ And [I_ think that] _it's not_ _my_ _responsibility_ [to] police myself [and] _pay Pennsylvania_ _what_ _they_ believe _they_ [are] owed even though [, you] _know_ _, _the_ _revenue_ stream_ went [to] another [state] [. [I] don't] [, I don't [think] that] [that's] _my_ _responsibility_ as [a] , as [a] conscientious consumer . 
A|7| A: [I ,] I'll agree [it] [, it's not] your [responsibility] _but ,_ _is_ [it] also legal , [for] [you] [to] _do that_ ? [from] [what] [I] understand [from] various net readings [, it] [, the] Federal government _is_ going [to] try [to] legislate [a] more aggressive enforcement _of state_ [tax] schemes [, uh ,] [in] , _into place_ [in the] next few years . It _is_ [, it] _is_ [a] lost [revenue stream] right now [and] states [can] use all [the revenue] [they] [can] get . With _some_ , _with_ [something] like [that _,] do_ your arguments still apply ? 
B|8| B: [Well _,] [I think_ that] _if , if_ policy [is] established [and] _if_ _a mechanism_ [is] put [into place] [to] promote [the] collection [of] [taxes] [in] _this_ fashion , [then] [I don't] argue [with] [it .] Because [it's not] [a] burden _on_ [the] consumer [to] remember [that] _oh , I_ bought _this_ [out [of] state] [. I] need [to] Xerox [the] receipt [and] make [out] [a] check [for] [six percent] [and] send [it] [to] _Pennsylvania ._ 
A|9| A: Which [is] exactly [what] _businesses do_ [at] [the] present . 
B|10| B: Right _. But the_ point [is] _is that_ [businesses [do] _that] ._ The business [that] [you] purchase [the] thing [from] [is] responsible [for] collecting [the] appropriate [sales tax] [and] forwarding [it] [to] [the state] [in] question . _That's_ [a] cost [of] doing business .

B|12| B: [Uh] .

A|17| A: [Yeah .]
