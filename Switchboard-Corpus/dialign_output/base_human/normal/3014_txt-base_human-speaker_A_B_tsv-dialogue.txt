A|0| A: Are _you_ _ready_ _to_ start ? 
B|1| B: _Yes_ . 
A|2| A: _Okay_ 
B|3| B: Have [you] recently _bought_ _a_ new _car_ Catherine ? 
A|4| A: _Well _, I_ just_ found _out_ _that_ _my_ [car] _like_ _an_ _old_ _was_ thirty _months_ _old _,_ and_ _it_ _doesn't_ seem _like_ _it's_ _that_ _old_ . 
B|5| B: _Oh ._ 
A|6| A: Seems _like_ _I just_ _bought _it_ ._ 
B|7| B: _Oh ,_ wow . 
A|8| A: _It's_ _an_ eighty-nine _and_ _I_ _bought _it_ _,_ uh ,_ _in_ _, uh ,_ eighty-eight so , yeah . 
B|9| B: [Well _, I] really_ _, the_ last [car] we _got_ [was] _a ,_ [was] _a_ used _car ._ _I really_ _don't_ prefer buying _a_ new _car ._ _I _like_ to_ let somebody else pay _for_ [that] 
A|10| A: [I] _know [, I_ really] _will_ _do_ [that] [the] next _time , I_ _buy_ _it_ _too ._ 
B|11| B: _But_ [, uh] mine [was] _a_ year [old ,] 
A|12| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: [and] we [bought it] _for_ very functional purposes , 
A|14| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [and] _that was_ we [bought] _a_ station wagon . We _wanted_ [an] economical [car] [to] operate , 
A|16| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _but_ we _wanted_ _one_ [that] could carry _a lot of_ equipment . _So_ , we chose _a_ Nissan Stanza wagon . 
A|18| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|19| B: And _I've_ _never_ been _sorry_ , 
A|20| A: [Oh ,] _that's_ wonderful . 
B|21| B: however [the] need _for_ [that] kind _of_ [car] has changed _now_ , 
A|22| A: _Uh-huh _._ Oh _,_ _okay_ ._ 
B|23| B: _and [,_ uh ,] while _it is_ still good [, _and] it's_ quite serviceable [, and] I'll drive [it] until [it] no longer _is_ reliable . 
A|24| A: _Uh-huh ._ Huh . 
B|25| B: And _probably_ then some I'll spend _a lot of_ [time] praying over [it] before [I] give [it] _up ._ 
A|26| A: _Sure_ . 
B|27| B: _I think_ [that] _I would_ _like _to_ _,_ if_ _you know ,_ we all say _, if I_ could _have_ _the car I_ always _wanted_ _I would_ either [buy] _a_ Nissan Maxima [, uh ,] 
A|28| A: Right . 
B|29| B: I'm sold _on_ Nissans . 
A|30| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|31| B: [I] _a_ _or_ _, or_ foreign cars actually . _Uh ,_ 
A|32| A: [But] _do you_ feel though [, uh ,] craftsmanship [is] _much_ superior _to _the_ American_ abilities ? 
B|33| B: _Uh ,_ 
A|34| A: Is [that] how _you [,_ I] [have] [never] , 
B|35| B: its reliability . 
A|36| A: _Its_ 
B|37| B: [Its] reliability . And [, uh [,] _I] _,_ you know ,_ _I've_ read all [the] CONSUMER REPORTS [and] things [, and] _they_ [just] run head [and] shoulders above [the American] made cars . _If_ _Ford_ [was] _a_ head _and the_ shoulders above [it ,] I'd [buy] _a_ _Ford_ . 
A|38| A: Isn't [that] [a] shame . 
B|39| B: _But _I_ had_ [, uh ,] _had_ [a] _Ford_ Escort [that] absolutely needed taps [the] day we _got_ [it .] 
A|40| A: My word isn't [that] [sorry] . _That's_ [sorry] . 
B|41| B: _Uh _,_ you know , _I_ mean_ [it] [was] [ready] _for_ [the] graveyard . 
A|42| A: My word . 
B|43| B: And [I] spent as [much] _on_ _that car_ [in] twelve [months] as [I] spent _for_ _the _car_ ._ 
A|44| A: [Oh ,] mercy . 
B|45| B: _So_ , 
A|46| A: _You_ , 
B|47| B: [and] _that was_ [just] trying [to] _hold_ us , getting [out] _of_ _that was_ [a] used _car ._ 
A|48| A: Huh . 
B|49| B: And [it] [was] [an] older [car] , 
A|50| A: Huh . 
B|51| B: _but_ _, you know ,_ Escort [is] supposed [to] [have] [a] great track record as far as sales . 
A|52| A: Huh _. Uh-huh ._ 
B|53| B: [But] [it's] [just] _, it_ [just] [was] not [and] [you] _get_ stung [a] [time] _or_ two , 
A|54| A: _Sure_ . 
B|55| B: [and] [you] say , no _thanks ._ 
A|56| A: _No_ [thanks .] _That's_ right . 
B|57| B: _So_ [, I just] trusted [the] CONSUMER REPORTS _and the_ auto [, uh ,] reports 
A|58| A: _Uh-huh , uh-huh ._ 
B|59| B: _had_ [my] son _who_ knows _a lot_ about [that] , study them thoroughly [, and] he gave _me_ four choices _of_ cars [to] [buy] 
A|60| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|61| B: An Escort definitely [was] not among them . In fact , there wasn't [an] [American] [car] [in] there . 
A|62| A: Wow . 
B|63| B: _Uh _,_ the_ Nissan came _and [,_ and] we [bought] [the] Nissan _for_ functional purposes not _what_ [the] CONSUMER REPORTS said we should _get_ . 
A|64| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: [But] [it] served our needs . _Uh ,_ later _on_ his reports _, the_ reports [that] he studied showed [that] [, uh ,] Nissan [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in] [the] [in] [the] class [that] we were looking _for_ . And [that] [, and] I'd rather [have] [a] Maxima than [a] Cadillac . [I really] _would_ . [It's] not necessarily prestige , 
A|66| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|67| B: _but_ [it's] _comfort_ . _Uh ,_ there's _a lot of_ features _on_ there [that] _are_ desirable _if_ _you're_ going [to] pay [that] kind _of_ money _for_ [a] _car ._ _Uh ,_ 
A|68| A: Who makes [that car] ? 
B|69| B: Nissan . 
A|70| A: [I mean] [but] where [are] [they] , where [are] [they] , [what] , [what] [is] their location , [is] [it [,] uh ,] Asian [or] [is] [it] European [or] [who] , 
B|71| B: [No] . [No] , no . Nissan _is Japanese ._ 
A|72| A: [Oh [,] [it] [is] Japanese .] 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh , uh-huh] , 
A|74| A: _Okay_ , 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [I] didn't [know] . 
B|77| B: _Yeah ._ And [, uh _,] if I_ couldn't [have] [my] luxury Maxima then I'd [buy] _me_ [a] fancy little red C _R_ X sports [car] 
A|78| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Okay_ 
B|79| B: [I mean] _, you know ,_ every every _one_ _of_ us [have] two sides 
A|80| A: [Yeah] _, I guess_ so _that's_ true _. Yeah ._ 
B|81| B: [Yeah .] Now [what] about [you _,] if_ [you] could [have] _the _car_ _that_ you_ _wanted_ [what] _would_ [you] _get_ 
A|82| A: [If] [, if] [, _if I] had [the_ car I] [wanted] . 
B|83| B: [and] why ? 
A|84| A: Gee . 
B|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: Probably , um [, uh ,] let's see [, [I] _like] the_ looks _of the_ Lincoln Town [car] 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh , uh-huh [.] Yeah .] See there , 
A|88| A: [But _I] _, I_ don't_ [know] [the] performance [of] [it .] _That's_ [a ,] [Ford] product , 
B|89| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|90| A: [and [,] you know _, I] would_ [get] hung [up] by [my] boot straps [if I] [if I] ever mentioned [the] [Ford] product [in] [my] family . 
B|91| B: _Uh-huh . _Uh-huh ._ Uh-huh ._ [I] tell [you] [that's] sad [too] because there _one_ [time] [Ford] [was] [the] best _, that was_ made . 
A|92| A: [Yeah] , yeah . 
B|93| B: Really [was] . 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: And [, uh [,] [I] [, I] really] [have] not seen _, now_ _a lot [of_ [the] American] cars actually [are] , [are] , parts [are] produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled here [or] vice versa . 
A|96| A: Can [I] put [you] [on] [hold] [for] [one] minute ? 
B|97| B: Of course . 
A|98| A: Thank [you] . [Well [,] that was] [one] minute . They hung [up .] 
B|99| B: [Okay] _Uh ,_ at any rate [do you] [have] _color preferences_ [or] [what] [would] be [the] features _that you_ [would] be looking [for] ? 
A|100| A: Um _, well [,_ the] [comfort] [of] [a] large [car that] [the] security [of] [a] large [car .] Um _, and the_ luxuries [of] [a] large [car .] 
B|101| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|102| A: [Uh [,] now] [color preferences] [, [I] think] [I would] opt [to] _go_ _with_ [a] bronze . Which [is] [probably] closest [to] gold _that you can_ [get] 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh , uh-huh [.] Yeah [.] Oh ,] wow . We [like the] stuff [that] glitters 
A|104| A: [Yeah .] 
B|105| B: Good . There's nothing wrong [with] [that] . Actually [I think] [probably] [if I] were going [to] [get] [if I] were going [to] be _practical_ , which [doesn't] [mean] [I would] be [, I would] prefer white . Because , simply because [it's] more visible at night . 
A|106| A: Right _, well ,_ [practical] yes [that's] _, Uh-huh ._ Right [and it's] cooler [I] believe , [too] , when [you're] driving [in] , 
B|107| B: And [, _Uh-huh .] Uh-huh ._ Now [the] interior [, okay] [, I don't] care about [the] interior [just] as long as [it's] not black [or] red . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh , uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [But] [if I had the] little red C _R_ X [, I guess] [the] interior [would] [have] [to] be black leather [and] I'd [have] [to] live [with] [that] . And [if I] _got the_ C _R_ X [it] [would] [have] [to] [have] [a] real good sound system [in] [it] because I'd want [that] [too .] 
A|110| A: [Oh .] 
B|111| B: I'd [just] [go] _back_ [to] [my] teenage years [and] [just] throw all [my] experience [to the] wind 
A|112| A: Um , _can_ [you [,] uh ,] hang [on] again 
B|113| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: Thanks [I've] [got the] phones [for] lunch hour . 
B|115| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [So] . Just [don't] mind [me] [if I] bounce [back] [and] forth . 
B|117| B: [That's] [okay .] 
A|118| A: Um , so [you] [like _to] listen to , uh ,_ [a lot of] _music [,_ or] [do] , [is] [it] talk shows . 
B|119| B: [No] , no , no . [I] generally [would] [uh ,] prefer [to listen to , uh [,] well [,] I] [listen to] K C B [I] [a lot] [but] [I] [will] [listen [to] the] news [and _the] [,_ and the] traffic [and] _those_ things at work . 
A|120| A: [Uh-huh , uh-huh .] 
B|121| B: [But] [if] I'm going [to] be traveling [in] [that car] [for] any period [of] [time , I] want some real good classical [music] . 
A|122| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: [I] love classical [music [,] and] [you] [just] can't enjoy [it] unless you've [got] [a] good sound system [to] produce all _the ,_ all [the] characteristics [of the] instruments . 
A|124| A: All [the ,] yeah [. Uh-huh .] [That's] true . 
B|125| B: [So] [I] [do] love classical [music] [or] [it] [or] [, or] [, uh ,] contemporary classical . 
A|126| A: Do [you] [listen] Do [you] [listen to] _W R R_ ? 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: Huh . 
B|129| B: [Sure] [do] . 
A|130| A: [Yeah .] 
B|131| B: [W R R] [and the] Oasis [are] [the] two [that] [I] [listen to ,] more than anything else . 
A|132| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|133| B: And [I] [do] [like] them . And I'd [like to] [have] [a] compact disc player [in] [the [car] .] That [would] be , something [that] [I would] [really] [like] . 
A|134| A: _Those_ [are] nice , aren't [they] ? [Yes] , [those] [are] nice . 
B|135| B: [Those] compact discs , [really] [are] good [for] cars because [they] [don't] melt , 
A|136| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|137| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
A|138| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|139| B: [You] [know ,] there's nothing [in] there [that] [can] wrap around [the [,] [the] [,] uh ,] rollers [or] anything . It seems [like] [a] [really] good answer [to] portable [music [,] [that] you can] choose . 
A|140| A: Huh .
