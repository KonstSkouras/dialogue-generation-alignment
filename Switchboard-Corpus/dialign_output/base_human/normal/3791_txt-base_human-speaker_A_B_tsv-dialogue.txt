B|49| B: Uh-huh . 
A|50| A: [and] whoever brought [it] down gets [the] lion's share [and the] rest _of [it_ is] split _with_ [the] rest , _with_ everybody [in] [the] group . 
B|51| B: _Oh , well ,_ that's nice . 
A|52| A: Well , he [they] , [they] went out _last year_ [and] almost everybody _got_ [it] , [the] limit
