A|58| A: [Yes .] 
B|59| B: [I] _really_ [like] [those] _, in_ fact [, I] had [a] harpsichord [played] _at_ [my] _wedding_ . 
A|60| A: [Oh ,] [did] _you_ ? 
B|61| B: [Yeah .] 
A|62| A: [Oh] . 
B|63| B: Which _was_ real _nice [._ I] _got_ married [, uh ,] during [the] Christmas season [and we] [played] [, uh ,] old fashioned Christmas carols instead [of] normal _wedding_ marches [and] _what_ [not [,] and] [it] _was_ real _nice_ [, I] liked [that] _a lot_ . 
A|64| A: [Oh] . 
B|65| B: [I] liked [the] sound [of the] harpsichord . 
A|66| A: _And_ [it] [played] _by itself_ ? 
B|67| B: [No ,] somebody [played] [it] 
A|68| A: [Well [,] I] mean [, but] _you_ _didn't_ [have] oboe [or something] [with] [it ?] 
B|69| B: [No , no] [, no] [, no] [, no .] Just [by itself] , [just] [by itself] . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] [Oh] . 
B|71| B: _It_ _was_ real _nice ._ 
A|72| A: [Well ,] that's [really] , yeah that's [, I] bet [that] [was] [nice .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah _.] It_ went [well [,] it] [was] [a] change [, you know ,] _from_ _your_ _traditional_ , normal [, you know ,] stuff [, and] since [it] [was] Christmas [time] _and [, and_ , uh [,] we] had [the] church decorated [with] Christmas hollies [and] poinsettias [and [,] you know ,] stuff [like] [that] [and] [so [,] we] [did] [the] harpsichord [with] old-time _traditional_ Christmas carols , 
A|74| A: [Oh] . 
B|75| B: Not , [not [,] you know [,] the] bouncy [, you know] sing along [kind] [but] _some of the_ old , older ones [that] 
A|76| A: Right . Right . 
B|77| B: _some [,_ [I] don't] even [, I] recognize [the] [, the] melodies [, and] whatnot [, but] [I] [didn't] recognize [the] [name] . 
A|78| A: Right . 
B|79| B: [So [,] it] [was] real [nice .] 
A|80| A: [Well] [actually] [, I] _play_ [, I] _play_ [the] violin [in] [, in] [a] string quartet [that] often _plays_ [at] weddings . 
B|81| B: Um . 
A|82| A: [So _,] um , I_ always [think [it's] a] [nice] break [from] [the] [traditional] organ [or] piano . 
B|83| B: Uh-huh . 
A|84| A: _And_ [, it] makes [, it] makes [it] [nice [.] It] makes [, you know [,] you] can say classy [or] [it] makes [an] elegant [wedding] [to] [have] [something] _else_ . 
B|85| B: [It] _does_ [. It] [really] _does_ [and] [it] has such [a] [different] sound [to] [it ,] anyway [. It's] almost [, [I] don't] [know] [the] way [it] vibrates [, [it's] kind of] haunting [, you know ,] _on_ , _on_ _some of the_ notes [It] [, it's] [, I , I] [like] [it] . 
A|86| A: [Oh] . 
B|87| B: [I don't] [know] how [else] [to] explain . _But _,_ we've_ _got_ friends [that] [are] [in the] [music] business [that] _go_ around Dallas , they're [, uh ,] called Odessa [. It's] [a] husband [and] wife team [that] _we've_ known [for] [years] [and , uh [,] we] try [to] make contact [with] them periodically _to see_ [what's] going _on_ [and] stuff [, too [,] so] _we've_ had _a lot of_ stuff [, you know ,] friends _and , and_ things [to do] [with] [music] [that] constant , plus [my] husband's real big into [music [,] too [,] so] . He doesn't [play] anything [, but ,] [he] [just] likes [to listen] . 
A|88| A: [Yeah .] 
B|89| B: [And] [my] dad [and] [my] kids [are] [now] [well [,] _my] oldest is_ getting [to the] point where [he] likes certain types [of [music] and] [favorite] songs [and] _when_ [they] come _on_ [we] [have] [to] turn [the] radio [up] full blast [and ,] 
A|90| A: [Oh] . Now [does] , [does] [the] [school] [in] [, in] [your] [, in] [your] city , [does] [it ,] [does] [it] offer , [like] _band_ [, or] [some of the] [instruments] ? 
B|91| B: [Yeah [,] well _,] my [,_ _my] oldest is_ only nine . 
A|92| A: Okay . 
B|93| B: [So] [he] hasn't [really] gotten into [, um ,] [that] yet . They [have] choir [that] [they] _go_ [to [,] you know ,] [music] class [that] [they] _go_ [to] 
A|94| A: Right . 
B|95| B: [but , um [,] he's] [not] old enough yet [to] get into [the] [band] yet . 
A|96| A: Right . 
B|97| B: [So ,] 
A|98| A: Right . 
B|99| B: [I] [think] [that] starts [in] sixth grade . 
A|100| A: Probably . [Oh] . 
B|101| B: [So ,] 
A|102| A: Gosh . 
B|103| B: [but] [I don't] [know .] He [, he's ,] [he [,] the] only [thing] [he's] shown interest [in] wanting [to play] [is] [the] drums cause [his [,] my] brother [plays] [, and [,] um , [I] don't] [, [I] don't] [know] _if_ [he's] [really] serious [about] [it] yet [or] [not] [you know [,] it's] [just] one [of] [those] things I'm [just] going [to] wait _and see if_ [he's] interested [in] [something] [, you know .] 
A|104| A: [Yeah .] Right . Right [, you] [got] [a little] ways [to go] [, too] Right . 
B|105| B: [Yeah ,] [just] [a little] bit 
A|106| A: Hey , [oh] . [Well [,] my [,] well [my] oldest is] eight [and , and] she's [, we've] , started [her] [on] piano [so [,] uh ,] 
B|107| B: [Uh] . 
A|108| A: [But ,] that's been [, it's] been fun [, I] mean [it's [a] lot of] [work] [to see] [that] she's prepared [but] [it's] been fun [, it's] been fun [, I] feel [like] I've learned [a lot] [about] [the] piano . I've learned [a lot] [about] playing [the] piano . 
B|109| B: Really ? 
A|110| A: [And] [, uh [,] it] [kind of] makes me [listen] [a little] closer [to [,] [to] the] piano [when] [I] hear [it] [at] [other] places [, or] [when] [I [,] you know ,] [see] [some ,] [see] [and] hear someone playing [. I] sort [of] watch their technique [, too [,] and , [and] see if] [it] corresponds [up] [to] [what] she's learning . 
B|111| B: [Yeah .] 
A|112| A: [So , it's] been fun . 
B|113| B: [I don't] [know] [if] any [of] mine will [be] interested [in] [it] [or] ...
