A|0| A: _Um _,_ are_ _you_ _working_ _right now_ ? 
B|1| B: _Uh ,_ yes _, I_ am . _I'm_ [working] _in_ _the_ computer science department _here_ _uh ,_ _at_ C M U . 
A|2| A: [Uh ,] What _kind _of_ ,_ _what_ _kind of_ _work_ _do_ _you_ _do_ ? 
B|3| B: [Uh _,] I'm_ doing basically system , system design _work and_ _, uh ,_ implementation [work] _for the_ speech _, _for_ the_ speech group _uh ,_ _here_ . 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Oh_ . _is that_ how _you_ heard about _this_ _thing_ ? 
B|5| B: _Yeah ,_ 
A|6| A: [Uh ,] 
B|7| B: actually through electronic mail . 
A|8| A: _Uh-huh ._ Me _too_ _. I_ [work] _at _,_ uh , the_ Georgia Tech Research Institute . 
B|9| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|10| A: _Um [,_ I'm] _a_ co-op student _so_ [I] [work and] go _to_ school about halftime . _And_ [, uh _,] I really_ _don't_ _have_ any job _benefits_ _to_ speak _of_ .

We_ _don't_ _really_ _have_ any vacation or _, you know ,_ sick days or _health care_ or anything _really_ _so_ . 
B|11| B: Right . So _it's_ _pretty_ fair they've got [you] slaving away , [at ,] [at] [this] point 
A|12| A: Exactly . Exactly . 
B|13| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|14| A: What about [you] ? 
B|15| B: Well [, um [,] I'm] _research_ _stuff_ _here_ [now] [so] [what] [they] [, they] _have [,_ uh [,] um ,] okay , [benefits] package . It's _not_ quite as good as industry _but_ one _of the_ significant [, um ,] [benefits] _here_ [is that] [you] _can_ _take_ [, uh ,] up [to] two courses [a] semester [, um ,] [and] [they] _pay for_ _you know , pay _for_ the classes_ . 
A|16| A: Huh . 
B|17| B: So _, that_ _works_ _out_ [to] _be_ [, um ,] [a] reasonable , [a] reasonable _benefit_ . 
A|18| A: [Yeah .] [Uh [,] they] _do_ [that] [I] think _if_ you're [, uh ,] [research] [here] then [I] [know] [of] some [of the] people [that] [have] gotten their masters [and] [I] think _that [,_ um [,] they] might _, [you know ,_ pay for] [that] . Pay [for the classes] [and] [stuff] 
B|19| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [but] [I] [know] [they] let [you] , they'll let [you] decrease how many hours [you] [work] by _kind of_ percentage . _You know ,_ they'll let [you] [work] halftime _if _you_ want to ,_ _if _you_ want to_ finish , 
B|21| B: If [you want to ,] [do] _it_ quickly . 
A|22| A: [you want to _,] [Yeah_ .] They'll let [you] [work] , decrease your number [of] hours by any percentage _just_ , _just_ about [so] _if [you_ want to] get your masters [and] then [, I] think [of] course [you] get _like_ [a] , _with_ your extra degrees [you] get [a] [pay] raise due [so] [that] will probably help [out] . 
B|23| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh _. _Yeah _._ Yeah_ ._ So [I] [, I don't know] _in_ _, in_ terms [of] other things , other [benefits] other than sort [of] monetary _I'd_ [, you know [,] I] [, _Yeah] _,_ we_ _, we_ [do] [. We] _have to_ contribute [a] certain amount [, uh ,] [to] _it_ . 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [And] _it's_ [kind of] split between C M U [and] , [and] [, you know [,] the] employee . 
A|26| A: [Yeah _. Yeah] [,_ I] think _, I mean_ _that's _pretty_ ,_ _that's a_ _pretty important_ [, uh ,] part [of] [it] there because _that , that_ [can] [be] _really_ expensive _if _you_ ever_ [have] any _health_ problems . My dad [, I] think my [, I'm] still covered _on_ , _with_ my dad's [, uh ,] _health_ plan [at] his , _where_ he [works] _, but_ [it] would definitely [be] something [to] look into once [I] get my own . 
B|27| B: Right [. Yeah ,] [and] _it's_ also , [right now] _it's_ [, uh , _the] ,_ [like] everywhere _else_ [, uh ,] [here] _in_ Pittsburgh [the] [health care] [, uh ,] rates [are] [, are] going up [pretty] quickly . 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: _That's_ _a whole_ other topic [to] begin [with] [too] [but] [. Yeah [,] but] _it's_ [, you] [are] [right] [. I] [, I] [, I really] agree [that , that] [that's [pretty] important] . 
A|30| A: [the] [I] think [the [,] I] guess [the] only real [, um ,] [benefit] [I] guess _you could_ say [working] [, for] me [working] [here] , besides _I mean_ [I'm] learning [and] [stuff] because [, I'm] [at _,] you know , in_ school . 
B|31| B: Right . 
A|32| A: But there's , there's some _where_ [, uh [,] uh ,] student employees [working] [for the] government [don't] [have to] [pay] _Social Security_ tax . [that's] about , five percent [right] there 
B|33| B: Right . [Uh-huh] [Oh] Now [that's a] big win . 
A|34| A: [so] . 
B|35| B: [Yeah _,] yeah_ . _That's_ , 
A|36| A: [That's] about [the] only real bonus 
B|37| B: [Yeah .] 
A|38| A: [I] [have _,] so_ [I] [have to] [take] [that] into consideration when [I] evaluate [like] how much [I] get paid [you know ,] because _if_ [I] was [working] somewhere [else] [I'd] [have [to] [,] [you know ,] pay] an extra five percent , or [so] . 
B|39| B: [Yeah [.] I] figured [for] [and] they've [just] raised [the [,] um ,] income caps [on] [Social Security] [to] [the] point [where] [you] [have to] [be] [pretty [,] you] [have to] [be] [pretty] _well_ off before [you] stop paying paying [that] as _well_ . 
A|40| A: Huh [. Yeah .] 
B|41| B: [Yeah _,] well_ [if [you] could] call [it] [a] [benefit] [that] C M U [, I mean] [the] other [thing] [that] [they] allow [you] [to] [do] [here] while [you] [are] [working] [is] , [is] consult [for] [, um [,] you know ,] other companies . 
A|42| A: [Oh] [, yeah] ? 
B|43| B: [Um [,] so] [that's] [, that] [kind of] helps [out] [in] terms _of , you know ,_ keeping up-to-date [with] contacts [in] industry . 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah .] 
B|45| B: [You [know ,] in] case [, you know , in] case [you ever] need [to] bail [out] 
A|46| A: help [a] lot [. Yeah .] See around , around [here] [it's] [like] [, uh [,] we] [pretty] much [work] from project [to] project [on] [, well] [, you know ,] [with] different sponsors . 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: There's [not] , there [is] [not] [a whole] lot [of , you know ,] funded [research] from ,
