A|8| A: _Uh-huh_ , uh-huh . [And] _what_ kinds _of things do you_ [use] _it for_ _when_ _you_ _when_ _you_ _go_ _to_ their houses _to_ them ? 
B|9| B: _Um ,_ usually _, uh ,_ _word_ processing something _, um ,_ such _as_ _, oh ,_ forms [for] [things] _, uh ,_ 
A|10| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|11| B: _also_ _I have_ [a] nine year old _that_ _I've_ _been_ _home_ schooling _for the_ last three _years ._

B|17| B: [And] _so_ _she_ _got_ _me_ copies _of , uh ,_ several _of the_ Apple programs [for] school programs , 
A|18| A: Great _. Yeah ._ 
B|19| B: _and_ _so_ _we_ [use] _those_ _and_ there's _some_ , whenever _we_ [go] _over_ _and_ visit grandma [the] kids love [to] play _the computer_ game _, _so_ _,_ that's_ part [of] _it ._ 
A|20| A: _Oh ,_ _sure_ . 
B|21| B: _Um _,_ my husband_ _has_ _used_ [the] one _at_ his folks house [for] mostly business [things] [. Uh ,] his resume , his _, uh ,_ letter , 
A|22| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|23| B: he's _been_ applying [for] jobs _and_ [things] _, so_ _that_ type _of thing_ [. Uh ,] forms [for] his photography business _, and_ _that_ _kind _of_ thing_ .

B|25| B: [Yeah .] 
A|26| A: [Uh ,] 
B|27| B: _I'm _,_ uh _,_ my_ father _had a_ _software_ _company_ , 
A|28| A: _Oh ._ 
B|29| B: _and_ _they have_ [a] bunch [of] _computers_ leftover _from_ _that_

B|31| B: _and_ we're hoping _that_ _they_ _can_ _put_ together something [for] us _here_ _that_ _we_ _can_ _have_ [the] _word_ processing , _here_ 
A|32| A: [Yeah .] 
B|33| B: _But , um _,_ they're_ _kind of_ old older

B|37| B: [Oh [.] _I] have_ one [of] _those_ [. Yeah .] 
A|38| A: Well , _then_ [, um ,] 
B|39| B: Mine's broke _at_ [the] moment _, but_ 
A|40| A: _Yeah ,_ ours really needs _to have_ [some] work done _on_ [it] [but] [, but] _then_ [my husband] [, um ,] worked [at] T [I] _and I_ [got] [a] [, um ,] this [has] [been] [years] ago _he_ doesn't work _there_ anymore [, but] _he_ [got] [a] [, um [,] uh , the] [, the] T [I] professional [and] brought [that] _home _and_ _I_ learned Wordstar_ _on_ _that ,_ 
B|41| B: [Oh .] 
A|42| A: _and ,_ boy _once_ [that] happened , _there_ _was_ [just] no way _that I_ _could_ ever [go] back [to] doing anything [of] length [of the] typewriter . 
B|43| B: [Yeah [,] [I] learned] [, _I] , [I_ learned Wordstar] [, uh [,] _I] did some_ typing [for] [my] father [when] [he] [had] [the] _company_ 
A|44| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|45| B: [and] _so [I_ learned] _that on_ [there] _too_ _, that was_ , 
A|46| A: [Yeah .] Have _you_ ever [used] , _do you_ [use] WordPerfect ever ? Have _you_ ever [used] WordPerfect ? Or , 
B|47| B: [I] haven't _. That's_ [the] one [that] [my] father [, well , I] guess _I have_ _used it_ [once] [or] twice . 
A|48| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|49| B: [Uh _,] it's_ [the] one _that's_ _on my_ father-in-law's _computer_ . 
A|50| A: Right . 
B|51| B: He's [got] [on] [I B M] . 
A|52| A: [Yeah ,] yeah [. That's] probably where you've [used [it] .] 
B|53| B: _And , uh , _so_ that's_ [the] program [that] [they're] _using_ [there] . 
A|54| A: _Uh-huh . Yeah ._ [Um [,] [I] have] [that [on] my] [, uh ,] [computer] _here and_ [also] [, um [,] I] [do] [some] work [at] U T D _and [,_ uh [,] that's] _what_ [they have] [there] [and] [it] [was] [just] [so] nice [to] [be able] _just to_ step _into the_ position _and [,_ and] already _know_ [the] _you know_ , already _know_ [the] [, the] [software] . [And [,] um [,] [I] don't] _know_ [from] [my] own experience [, um ,] WordPerfect [is] [just] [so] _much_ _better_ than , than [Wordstar] _at least_ [the] version [of] [Wordstar] _that I_ [used] _to have_ . It may [be] improved by now [but] , 
B|55| B: [That's] [what] _I've_ heard . 
A|56| A: [Yeah [,] it's] [, uh ,] [Wordstar] [was] never very intuitive [to] _me [._ I] mean _you know_ _, you_ , [some] [of the] commands [just] [had] nothing [to do] _with_ _, you know_ _, what_ _you_ were supposed [to] [be] doing [what] [they] _, what_ [they] [did] [on] [the computer] [but] [, uh ,] 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [I] mean like _going_ [, um ,] forward [and] backward [a] [word] [or] _up_ [and] _down_ [a] line [that] sort [of thing] [just] _, you know_ , didn't match _with the_ kinds [of] keys _, you_ were [using] . 
B|59| B: [Yeah [,] _you] had [to_ ,] memorize _it ,_ 
A|60| A: [Yeah .] 
B|61| B: [and ,] 
A|62| A: [And [,] but] WordPerfect [is] [just] [a] _lot_ more intuitive [in] [a] _lot_ [of] ways . [And] [you] [, and] [it] does [a] _lot_ _of things_ [too] [that] _if_ [you] _, if_ [you] [do] any _kind [of ,_ uh ,] research [or] anything like [that] where [you] [have] [to [,] uh ,] [use] footnotes _, it_ [is] [just] _wonderful ._ Because [it] keeps track [of] all your footnotes . 
B|63| B: [Oh _.] Oh [,_ that's] _neat ._ 
A|64| A: [Yeah [,] and] _if_ [you] add [it _,] if_ [you] [put] [a] footnote [in] , [in the] middle _, you know_ _, if_ [you] come _up_ _with_ [some] new piece [of] documentation [and] [you] [put] [that] [in the] middle [of] your paper [and] [have] [to] footnote _it , you_ [just] change [, um _,] it_ [just] automatically changes all your footnoting numbers _for you ._ 
B|65| B: [Oh ,] _how_ [wonderful .] 
A|66| A: _So_ _, you know_ [, it's] [just] , 
B|67| B: That [, [I] had] heard _that _that_ was_ [better] . That _was a_ [better] one . 
A|68| A: _Yeah [. Yeah_ .] [And I] think [about] [how] [it] [used] [to] [be] _if_ [you] were doing [a] paper [and] [you had to] [go] back [and] retype everything [, and] [oh _,] it_ [was] [just] awful . _So_ [, um [,] [I] don't] _know_ [I] think [we] [have] [just] become really spoiled _. But_ [I] think [, it's] [a] nice [kind of] way [to] [be] spoiled 
B|69| B: [Yeah [. Yeah] [,] I] agree 
A|70| A: _So_ [, um [,] well , [I] have] [not] really paid _much_ attention because [I] clock , although [I] think _we've_ probably [been] talking _at least_ ten minutes [so [,] um _,] if_ [you] [, um ,] unless [you] [have] [some] [other] [things] [you] want [to] _talk_ [about] [as] having [to do] _with_ P C 
B|71| B: Not [too] [much] . What [kind of [,] what] [kind [of] things do you] write ? 
A|72| A: Well [, um [,] I] [was a] technical writer [for] [many] [years] [, um ,] 
B|73| B: [Oh] 
A|74| A: [and] [my husband] _and I_ actually met [in] [a] [computer] [company] . [Um [,] I] [was a] tech writer [and] [he] [was] [an] engineer . [And , uh , [so] [I] did] tech _writing_ [for] [a] number [of] [years .] 
B|75| B: _to her_ Go [talk] [to] Daddy [about] [it .] Excuse [me .] 
A|76| A: [Oh ,] [sure] . 
B|77| B: _to her_ Go _on and_ [talk] [to] Daddy [about] [it] Tell Daddy [I] unplugged [it [for] you [.] But] [you] [don't] _need_ [to] drag [it] [down] [the] hall 
A|78| A: Got [a] problem , huh ? [Um ,] 
B|79| B: Daddy , Daddy came [home and] found _her_ playing [with the] telephone [that [I] had] unplugged 
A|80| A: [Oh .] Trying [to] figure _out_ [what] all [that was] [about] , huh ? 
B|81| B: [Yeah .] 
A|82| A: [But , um [,] [I] have] [, um [,] _that] [,_ that was] [the] majority [of] [my] _writing_ although [, um [,] [I] have] [also] done [oh ,] free lance magazine _writing_ [and] [some] educational _writing_ . [And [,] um ,] [for] [a] while [I [had] a] [, um [,] uh ,] [a] partnership [with] [a] , [in] [an] advertising agency [with] another woman [who is] [a] , [an] artist . _So_ [I did some] advertising [and] P R [but] , 
B|83| B: Huh . 
A|84| A: [um ,] now [I'm ,] actually [I'm ,] [I'm not] working anymore _. I'm_ [a] student , [I'm] [a] graduate student [so I'm] doing [a] _lot_ [of] _writing_ [but] [, uh ,] now all [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|85| B: [Yeah .] 
A|86| A: [I've] done [a] little , [a] _lot_ [of] different kinds [, but] [I , I] [just] _know_ _right_ now [that I] couldn't [have] [put] _out_ half [of] [what] [I did] _if_ [that] [much] without [the] being [in] [computers] [so that's] [been] really great . [And , uh ,] [I'm [,] [so] I'm] real spoiled . 
B|87| B: [Yeah [.] I'm] anxious [some] day [to have] one [here .] 
A|88| A: [Yeah .] 
B|89| B: [I'm [,] and] [they] [just] talked [to] [the] [other] day [other] day [about] setting something [up] again [so] hopefully pretty soon we'll [at least] [have] [the] [word] processing . 
A|90| A: _Uh-huh . Yeah ._ 
B|91| B: My nine year old [I've] decided [to] teach _her_ [how] [to] type [using] [the computer] , 
A|92| A: Good . 
B|93| B: _so ._ 
A|94| A: [That's] great . 
B|95| B: [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: [Yeah .] 
B|97| B: [I've] , 
A|98| A: Well , [those] are skills [that] [she] certainly [is] _going to_ [need] early [on [and] _,] you know_ [, the] [, and] [it] seems like [it's] getting earlier [and] earlier [with the] children . 
B|99| B: [That's] [right] . 
A|100| A: _So_ [, um [,] I] think [that that] _would be a_ real , [a] real [, uh ,] advantage [to ,] [to _her] [to_ have] [that] [and [,] uh ,] [do] [it] early , 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh . Yeah .] 
A|102| A: [so [.] Uh ,] [do] 
B|103| B: We've [been] , [we've] [been] [, uh ,] [writing] [a] story together . 
A|104| A: [Oh ,] [neat .] 
B|105| B: [And] [so [I] [,] and I] wanted [her to] [put] [it] [into [the] computer] [, and] [then] print [it] [out] [and ,] make [a] book [with] [it [, you] know] . 
A|106| A: _Yes_ . Right [. Oh ,] great . 
B|107| B: [And] [so I] decided [well [,] if] she's [going [to] do] [that [,] it] [would be a] whole [lot] easier [if] [she] [could] type 
A|108| A: Right 
B|109| B: [So] we'll slowly learn [just to] type [here and] [then] [then] [put] [the] story [in] . 
A|110| A: [That's] great . Well [, that's] [a] [, that's] [a] skill [that] [she] [can] [use] [for the] rest [of] [her] life [, so] Might [as] [well] start now , huh ? 
B|111| B: [Yes] , yes [. I] agree . 
A|112| A: Well , Nola [I have] enjoyed talking [with] [you] thoroughly . This [is] really [going to] [be] fun [I] think , 
B|113| B: [Yeah .] 
A|114| A: [and [,] um [,] my husband] [is] [a] ham radio operator [and I] think [about] all [the] people [that] [he] talks [to] all [over] [the] ,
