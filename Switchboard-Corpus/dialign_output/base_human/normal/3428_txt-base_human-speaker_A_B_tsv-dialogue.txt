A|0| A: Okay _on_ _a_ scale _of_ _one_ _to_ _ten_ _where_ do _you_ _stand_ _and_ why ? 
B|1| B: _Well _,_ I_ guess _I_ [stand] [on] _, uh ,_ [on] , _probably_ [ten] _for_ _no_ _, uh ,_ restrictions _. _I_ _,_ uh ,_ recently _just_ _moved_ [to] Texas from _, uh ,_ South Dakota [and] Nebraska _, and I_ guess _in_ terms _of gun control_ I've _always_ _, uh ,_ _been_ _raised_ _with _the_ , uh ,_ idea _in the_ Constitution _that _,_ uh ,_ citizens had [a] _right_ [to] bear arms _, and I_ realize _that_ _probably_ _way_ back _when_ _when_ _the_ Constitution _was_ written _it_ _probably_ regarded _, uh ,_ more _, uh ,_ _of a_ national defense _, uh ,_ _than_ anything else _, but_ _, uh ,_ _on the_ other hand _, too_ _, uh ,_ people _then_ _, uh ,_ needed [to] use firearms _for_ , um , survival _in_ terms [of] _, uh ,_ food 
A|2| A: Yes , true . 
B|3| B: [and] _, uh _,_ _I_ was raised_ _, uh _,_ you know ,_ _hunting_ _all_ _the_ time _, I_ _lived_ _on the_ farm _, and_ _, uh _,_ you know ,_ enjoy _hunting _and_ I_ guess _I have_ _, uh _,_ some_ problems _with_ _, uh _,_ being_ restricted [to] , um , owning _a gun_ _for_ _, you know ,_ _hunting_ purposes mainly . 
A|4| A: Right . 
B|5| B: _And_ , um _, it_ scares _me_ [a] little bit [to] _think that_ _they_ _would_ begin restricting _gun control_ _to the_ point [where] , um , eventually _we_ may _not_ _be_ able [to] _have_ _that_ _right_ any more . 
A|6| A: _Yeah [,_ I] can [, I] can understand [that] [. [I] was raised] [in] Oklahoma [, and] _of course_ [, being] Oklahoman [and] Texan [, uh _,] yeah _,_ the_ [hunting and] everything [, and I] used [to] _things_ [in] my father [and] my husband having guns [and] _all [, and_ _I] , I_ did , used _to be_ [all] [in] favor [of] _it [,_ but] it's , [all] [of a] sudden it's starting [to] _get_ really scary [with] these gangs . Yet _I think_ [I] [would] vote [a] _one_ _if_ [I] thought [that] [it] [would] [be] nation wide [and] [they] can guarantee [no] _one_ _would _have_ [a_ gun] , [no] crooks , nothing . But because [I] [know] _that's_ [not] _going_ [to] happen , [then] [I have] [to] [probably] [right] _up_ _there_ about an eight 
B|7| B: [Yeah _,] [it_ [,] uh ,] moving [to] _this_ area , _of course it_ happens everywhere [, but] [, uh [,] I] guess we're pretty naive _coming_ from small towns [, uh ,] _in the_ midwest [and] [then] [, uh ,] moving [to] [a] larger city [where] [there] _are_ drive-by shootings [and] [, uh ,] [there] _seems like_ killing _for_ [no] reason at [all , and] [, uh] . 
A|8| A: [Well [,] it] [just] [seems like] [in the] past three or four _years_ [it] has [just] gotten _so_ _much_ worse [than] [it] [was] . There's [always] [been] [a] certain amount [of] crime [in] your [, you know ,] your urban areas [, and I] [know] [we] [lived] [in] Chicago [for] seven _years_ [, and] [of course it] [was] definitely [there] . So [when] [we] first [moved] here [, it] wasn't as _bad_ as [this] . It's [, you know ,] it's [just] getting [all] [of a] sudden _so_ _much_ worse [. I] don't [know] whether it's due [to the] drugs [and] [the , uh ,] drug kings [that] [are] here [and] Jamaican drug kings [coming] [in] [. I] don't [know] whether _that's_ [it ,] or street gangs [. I] don't [know] what [the] answer is [. I] [know] [that] it's scary [, and] yet [I] hate _the government_ constantly telling [me] what [I] can do [and] what [I] can't do [, and] _that's_ basically what [the] [gun control] [would] end _up_ [being] . 
B|9| B: [I , [I] think] [so] [, and] [, and] there's [always] [the , uh [,] [the] , uh [,] the] old [, uh ,] saying [that] keeps [coming] [up] [that] [if] [a] person wants [a gun] [bad] enough they'll , they'll [get] [one] [, and] [, uh [,] and] [then] [, uh] . 
A|10| A: [Well ,] it's very true . 
B|11| B: [Yeah] . 
A|12| A: It's [not] [the] law abiding citizen [that [,] you know ,] is , is dangerous [with the] [gun] It's [the] ones [that] _are going_ out [and] stealing [it] . 
B|13| B: [Yeah] . 
A|14| A: [And] [I] said [I think] [the] only [way] [I] [would] [be] _in big_ favor [of gun control] is _if they_ could absolutely guarantee [that] nobody _would have_ them . [And] [I [think] that] [would] almost [have] [to] go [with] armies [, too] [. I] mean , they'd [have] _to be_ almost world-wide , which [we] [know] [would] never ever happen . 
B|15| B: [Yeah [,] yeah ,] [that's] [for] sure . 
A|16| A: Because even [if] [you] said , okay [, you know ,] armed forces could [have] them [, some] idiot [would] come out [and] sell [it] [to] somebody [on the] street [to] make [a] quick buck . 
B|17| B: [Yeah [,] and] [, uh [,] and] [, you know [,] uh [,] I] suppose [, uh ,] [years] ago , [way] back [when] [, uh ,] [when] [, uh ,] [they] had [the] revolutionary war [and] people decided [that] [they] [, uh ,] were fed [up] [with [the] government] [, uh [,] and] [if they] didn't [have a] [way] [to] [, uh ,] [to] fight back [they] [would have] [been] [in big] trouble . 
A|18| A: That's very true very true . Who knows , [we] maybe want [to] overthrow [the government] 
B|19| B: [Well [,] the] [way] [things] [are going] . 
A|20| A: [I] [know _,] if_ somebody doesn't do something . Uh , what about [, uh ,] what do [you] [think] [of] [this] , [this] [, uh ,] law [that] they're putting into effect [that] [you] [have] [to] wait X number [of] days before [you] can [, uh ,] carry [the] [gun] , or buy [, you know ,] actually purchase [the] [gun] ? 
B|21| B: [Well [,] you know ,] [they] introduced [some] [gun control] back [when] [I was] [a] teenager [, I] believe , [in] terms [of] [, uh ,] every [gun] [you] bought had [to be] licensed [, I] believe . 
A|22| A: Yes . 
B|23| B: [And] [, uh [,] you know ,] [that] didn't bother [me] [, uh [,] too] [much] [, and] [so] [, I] guess [it] depends , um [, if] [there] [are] [some] statistics [that] show [that [,] uh ,] [that] people [, uh ,] commit crimes [on the] spur [of] [the] moment .
