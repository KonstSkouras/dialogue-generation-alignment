B|6| B: Uh-huh . 
A|7| A: _but_ _usually_ sometimes _every_ few summers _. Well _,_ all_ _, see _,_ _all_ _the_ _family_ lives in_ once _place_ , except _for_ [a] few _of us are_ _scattered_ _about_ . 
B|8| B: _Right ._ 
A|9| A: _So_ _they're_ pretty _much_ _just_ reunited _always_ 
B|10| B: Uh-huh . 
A|11| A: _so_ _it's _,_ it's_ _just_ once _in a_ while _we_ _get_ _the_ special gathering _with_ everyone _together ._ 
B|12| B: [Well _,] it_ might be [a] _good_ time [for] _you_ _to_ _to_ , _to_ start [a] tradition . 
A|13| A: _I_ _know ,_ [that's] 
B|14| B: You could be responsible [for] _that_ yourself . 
A|15| A: _do_ _that ,_ [that's] true . 
B|16| B: _Sure_ . 
A|17| A: How _about_ [your family] ? 
B|18| B: [Well ,] [in] [my] [family] , let's [see ,] last October _was the_ forty fifth annual [uh ,] _reunion_ . 
A|19| A: Wow , _you're_ _, a_ pro _at_ _this_ . 
B|20| B: The _first_ Sunday [in] October _, the_ Jordan [family] gets [together .] 
A|21| A: Oh , [that's] [good] . 
B|22| B: _And_ [all] _of the_ descendants _of the_ Civil War _, I_ mean , yeah _, the_ Civil War veterans _come_ _together , and_ _they_ _come_ _as_ far _away from_ California _, and_ there's [usually] _oh ,_ between [a] hundred _and_ fifty _and_ two hundred _and_ fifty _people_ . 
A|23| A: _And then_ where _do_ [you] meet ? 
B|24| B: Uh , there's [a] _big_ community _hall_ _in Vernon_ Texas , 
A|25| A: Okay . 
B|26| B: _and , uh ,_ [that] seems _to_ be sort _of a_ middle ground [for] [all] _of the_ Texas [family] . 
A|27| A: Okay . [Do you have] relatives [in Vernon] _then_ ? 
B|28| B: Uh-huh . 
A|29| A: Okay . 
B|30| B: _Right_ , uh-huh . A _lot_ _of the_ _older_ [family lives [in] Vernon] . 
A|31| A: [Right .] 
B|32| B: Um [, all] [of] his direct descendants , descendants [have] now died _and the_ grandchildren [are] [in] _their_ seventies _and_ eighties . 
A|33| A: Oh . 
B|34| B: [So] we're talking [about] _second_ _and_ third great children here . 
A|35| A: [Right .] 
B|36| B: Uh _, I_ take [my] boys _well _,_ I_ took _them_ up until _this year ,_ [they're] grown _and_ gone _from_ _home_ now 
A|37| A: Oh . 
B|38| B: [so] _they_ , _they_ take _their_ [family] . 
A|39| A: [Right .] 
B|40| B: _But_ [, uh ,] let's [see ,] [that] _would make_ _them_ , grandfather , great grandfather , great great grandfather , okay _, _so_ it_ _would_ be _the second_ great grandchild . [And] [so] _they_ , 
A|41| A: Okay [, so] [this] town [hall] [that] [you] meet _in ,_ _is_ [that] _like_ _a ,_ um , 
B|42| B: [Well _,] it's a_ community center _, it's a_ community [hall] . It's [, a] great _big_ open building [that] has [a] _wonderful_ kitchen _it_ [in ,] 
A|43| A: Okay . 
B|44| B: _and , uh _,_ you_ [just] bring [the] covered dishes . Every _, every_ [family] brings _a , a_ dish [of] some _kind_ _, and_ _you get_ [all the] _wonderful_ old [family] recipes , [that] [have] _been_ handed , _down_ [for] _years_ 
A|45| A: Potato _salad_ [and , uh ,] 
B|46| B: [Well ,] [we] try _to_ stay _away from_ those _things_ which might [have] [, uh ,] salmonella [in] _them ._ 
A|47| A: Oh , [that's] [good] . 
B|48| B: [And] [we] choose _to_ bring congealed [salad] . You can bring [a] congealed vegetable [salad] , _as_ opposed _to_ potato [salad] . 
A|49| A: [Right .] 
B|50| B: [And] [we] [are] very conscious [of] , most [of us are] very conscious [of] , [of] [, uh ,] sanitation aspects , whatever you've got _to_ carry [for] any distance . 
A|51| A: [Right .] 
B|52| B: [I] [always] , take _home_ baked _bread_ . 
A|53| A: Oh , [that's] nice . 
B|54| B: Uh , [that] happens _to_ be [my] specialty [for] [that] [family] _. I_ [do] other _things_ very _well ,_ 
A|55| A: [Right .] 
B|56| B: [but] [there] [are] others _in the family who_ [do] _them_ better . 
A|57| A: [Do] [they] [always] [have] _the , the_ [one] person [in the family who] knows _, or_ everyone thinks [they] _know_ _how_ [to] [make] [this] [the] best [, so] _that's what_ _they get_ [to] cook . 
B|58| B: Uh-huh . 
A|59| A: [Well ,] [that's] [good] _. Well [,_ I] _had a_ professor [in] anthropology _at_ school [who] studied [family] _reunions [,_ so] [I] learned [a] [lot] [about] [them [.] _I] haven't ,_ [been] [to] [a] [lot] , 
B|60| B: Uh-huh . 
A|61| A: [but] [we] _talked_ [, a] [lot] [about] _the , the_ rituals , 
B|62| B: Uh-huh . 
A|63| A: [you] [all] equated [the family] _reunions_ _as ,_ _with_ [the] Protestant . 
B|64| B: Uh-huh . 
A|65| A: _It [was_ the] Protestant version [of the] Catholic pilgrimage . 
B|66| B: Uh-huh . 
A|67| A: _It _was_ _,_ it was an_ interesting theory . She _talked_ [about] _the [,_ uh [,] the] Catholics [all] [, it's a] [home] centered _, you know , it's_ [all] [family] centered anyway [, so] [you] [usually] [are] living where [your] parents live [and] [it's] [all] , [your] [, you] _don't_ [have] [to] [come] [home] [, so] [the] Catholics [would make] [a] pilgrimage [in] [older] Europe _, but_ _when_ [the] Protestant ethic happened [in] America , [there] were _people who_ ever went _out_ _and , you know ,_ went [away from] [the family] [to] seek [their] fortune _, and then_ _had to_ [come] _back_ [home] [for] [their] [reunion] [, so] _that ,_ became [their] version [of the] pilgrimage . 
B|68| B: Uh-huh . [Right .] 
A|69| A: [But] she _had_ _, it was_ interesting _, you know _, I_ don't know_ _how_ valid [it] _is_ _, but_ she _talked_ [about] [that] [and] _how_ _the , the_ [big] picnic table [was the] symbolic communion [of the] [people] gathering [together _, and] ,_ um _, you know ,_ [about] [the] [bread] [and the] ritual placement . [Do you [have] [a] , a] certain way [that] everything _is_ placed _out_ _on the_ table [every] [, _every] year_ ? Is [there] _kind of [a_ _,] you know ,_ salads go [first] [and] [things] _like_ [that] ? 
B|70| B: [Well [,] [it's] [,] uh ,] [we] [have] [, uh [,] uh ,] [kind of a] core group [that ,] [that] serves [as ,] quote , officers [of the] organization , 
A|71| A: [Right .] 
B|72| B: [and] [they] plan [the] [reunions [,] the] organize [the [,] you know ,] [who] [is] going [to] [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot gets [there ,] who's going [to] rent [the] tables , who's going [to] [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware gets turned [back] _to the_ caterer . Uh [, and] each [year] [it's] _done_ [a] little bit differently , because different [people] serve [in] those roles . 
A|73| A: [Well ,] [that's] pretty . 
B|74| B: _We_ [have a] biographer [who] , [who] continues [every year] [to] save clippings [on] any [family] member [, and] [they're] entered into [a , a] _wonderful_ [, uh ,] scrap book . [And] pictures [of] new babies [and] new [people who] [have] [been] added [and [,] and] obituaries [to] those [who] [are] gone . [And] [it] keeps [the family] alive , even [, you know ,] even though [it's] very fluid . 
A|75| A: [Sure] does . That's _wonderful ._ 
B|76| B: [And] [they're] very dedicated [to] [that [,] [and ,] uh [,] it's] [been] [really] [wonderful .] [It] helps [you] hang onto [your] roots . 
A|77| A: Yeah [. I] wish we'd , 
B|78| B: [And] [it] helps [you] feel [a] strong sense [of] belonging . My husband , [on the] other hand _, was_ [not] very close [to] his [family] . His [family] [was] very [scattered] [and] very diverse . 
A|79| A: [Right .] 
B|80| B: "And [I] asked him [, I] got [to] talking [to] him [, I] said _, well ,_ [how] [is] his nephew doing . ""Well [, I don't [know] , [I] haven't ,] [talked] [to] [my] brother [in] three _years_ . "" [I] said , ""Well , how's [your] brother doing ? "" ""I [don't know] . "" Uh [, you know ,] [my] son keeps [in] touch [with] him [, I] think [, but] [I don't] . " 
A|81| A: [Right .] 
B|82| B: "I said , ""Hey , wouldn't [you] [like] [to] [know] what's happening [with] these [people] ? "" ""Yeah [, but] I'm [, you know , it's] too [much] trouble . "" [So] [I] got busy , got [together , and] put [a] [reunion] [together] [for] his [family] . [And] succeeded [in] getting [all] [of] his brothers [and] sisters [and] [all] [of] [their] offspring [but] [one] [to] _our_ [place] _down_ [at] Lake Tawakoni . " 
A|83| A: Wow . You're [just] [, uh ,] Oh , [that's] incredible . 
B|84| B: Liked [to] kill me , because [I] [it [was] [,] I] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation [, I] did [, it] by myself . 
A|85| A: [Right .] 
B|86| B: [And] [, uh ,] nobody brought covered dishes _. We [had_ a] great [big] fish fry [, [and [,] you know ,] I] fixed [a] [salad] [in a] number three tub . 
A|87| A: [Right] 
B|88| B: [And] [, [and ,] uh [,] it was an] enormous task [to] bring [all] [of] those [people] [together] [with] [just] [one] [or] two [people] helping . [And] [, uh ,] _we [had_ to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] [all] [of] [them] [and] [I] told him , 
A|89| A: Have [you] , [have] [you] [done] [this] repetitively _, or_ [just] once ? 
B|90| B: "We did [it] [that] _year [,_ and _then] the_ following summer , [we] did [not] [have] [all] [of [the] family] [there] _. We_ sent invitations _. We_ said , ""Please let [us] [know] if [you're] coming . "" [It was] [when] [, uh ,] his mother , his step father [had] died [the] [year] before , " 
A|91| A: Oh . 
B|92| B: [and] [it] , his mother [was] alone [, _and] so_ [they] came [to] support her [, and then] [one] by [one] , his [you know ,] his sisters , he began [to] lose [family] members , 
A|93| A: See , [that's] we've [we [had] a] problem [with] [that] . 
B|94| B: [and] [it was] difficult [to] hold [them] [together .] [And then] , [of] course , he died two _years ago_ [, so] [, you know ,] [that] [family] has gone _down_ [to] [one] brother [and] [one] sister now . 
A|95| A: Oh . 
B|96| B: [And] [, uh [,] it] [, I] think [that's what] happens [when] [they get] [scattered] [, [the] , [the] family] unit [, you know ,] falls , into disrepair . 
A|97| A: [Right .] That's [our] [, was] [our] problem [. We had] [, uh [,] the] [first] [reunion] _, or_ [the] [first] [, you know ,] major [reunion] [was] probably six [or] seven [years ago] . 
B|98| B: Uh-huh . 
A|99| A: [And [then] [the] second] [reunion] , [people who] maybe [, you know ,] [had] sacrificed [things] [to] [come] [to the] [first] [one] thought , [oh [,] well [,] it's] [not] [that] [big] [a] thing [this year ,] 
B|100| B: Uh-huh . 
A|101| A: [and [so] it] [kind of] wound [down] , 
B|102| B: Uh-huh . 
A|103| A: [and then] finally [, you know ,] [you're] lucky [to] [get] [, you know [,] [you] get] [the] Shreveport relatives [there [,] but] no [one] else [so] [that ,] 
B|104| B: Uh-huh [. Well [,] see ,] [we] manage , those [people who] [are] [at] [that] core group manage [to] keep , keep [the] vigor alive . They'll send [out] news bulletins . Two [or] three times [a] [year] you'll [get] [a] news hey , guess [who] got [, you know ,] elected [to the] legislature [, or] guess [who] [our] local sheriff ,
