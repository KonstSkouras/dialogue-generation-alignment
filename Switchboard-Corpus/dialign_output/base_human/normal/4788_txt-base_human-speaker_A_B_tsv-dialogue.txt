A|2| A: _Oh_ _yeah_ _, yeah ._ We did _a lot_ [of] different things . We'd stop when _we_ wanted _to_ , _that_ kind [of] _stuff_ .

B|9| B: [Oh] [, yeah _.] That's_ beautiful . 
A|10| A: _And_ _we just_ _have_ _this_ _, uh ,_ really good time _there_ .

B|11| B: Right 
A|12| A: We found _this_ one area _that_ doesn't _have_ mosquitoes . They _just_ don't _have_ them _and_ _it's_ _just_ wonderful _not_ _to be_ bugged all night [long] with [a] humming mosquito at _your_ ear , 
B|13| B: [Oh] [, yeah .] [Well ,] most [of] [my] [camping [,] I] haven't done _much_ [since] [I] [was a] kid [but [, uh ,] we'd] , basically , [take] [the] [tent] _up in the_ Sierras [and , uh ,] usually [just] camp near [some] stream _or_ [some] lake . 
A|14| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . 
B|15| B: [And] [, uh , just] , [it] wasn't even [a] _, a_ full [tent] . It would [be] more [a] tarp [, uh] strung [up] between trees 
A|16| A: Sure . [Uh-huh .] Sure . 
B|17| B: [and , uh [,] we just] thought [it was] absolute heaven . 
A|18| A: _Yeah_ [, yeah .] 
B|19| B: [Uh ,] [there was] _certainly_ nothing [like] [a] _, [a_ bathroom] _, _a_ shower_ _or_ anything , near by It [was] dig [your] own hole [and , uh] [and I] I'm [not] [sure] I'd [do] [that] [that] anymore , 
A|20| A: That [was] really called roughing _it [,_ yeah [.] I] , Anymore . _Yeah_ , see 
B|21| B: [but] _it's ,_ [it [,] uh [,] uh ,] actually [some] friends [of] [mine] [and I] [are] planning [to] camp [this] summer [, uh ,] [for] four days . Also [going] fishing [, uh] 
A|22| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . [Uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [and I] [have a] idea [it's] _going to be_ [a] _, [a_ lot] more equipment [and [a] lot] more [stuff] than before . 
A|24| A: Than [you] , [sure] . Than [it ,] when [you] were younger , uh-huh . 
B|25| B: [Yeah] [. But ,] 
A|26| A: [it ,] with kids they don't care if they [take] [a shower] everyday . With kids they don't care , [you] know [, uh [,] a] about [a lot] [of] things [. But] as adults [, uh ,] [it's] [like] if [I] don't [take] [a shower] every day [, I] feel [like] , [you] know , ooh . 
B|27| B: [Yeah] . 
A|28| A: [I] [, I] [just] don't feel right so . There's lots [of] places if you're [going to] [go] [camping] . K O A [are] wonderful . It's kind [of] [it's] kind [of] [the] [, uh ,] yuppie type [of] [camping] because they [have] showers , they [have] things [for] kids [to] [do] . They [have] swimming pools , things [like] [that] . If [you] can find [, uh ,] [some] really nice , clean [, uh ,] campgrounds versus [, uh ,] if [you go] [to] state parks [, uh ,] 
B|29| B: [Oh] , [my] . 
A|30| A: [we] [have] found state parks , [not] [that] they're lacking [but , uh ,] they're [certainly] [not] [up] [to] [a] standard [of a] K O A [where] [it's ,] [you] know [, a] little bit cleaner . You've got [the] showers available . It's [not] , [you] know [, [in] the] same category . State parks , [you] know , [you] get [a] little bit fearful too [, uh ,] [you] know , things [like] [that] simply because [it ,] they [are] supposed [to be] patrolled [but , uh ,] [you] know , [it's ,] [it's] [a] little bit different [. But ,] so we've always kind [of] stayed with [a] K O A [and] [then] [, uh ,] did other things besides [just] sit at [the] campground at night [. That's] [the] only time [you] really use [your] campground . If you're [going to be] gone all day [long] , walking someplace [or] doing tourism [or] whatever [uh ,] you're [camping] really is [just] [for] [like] [in the] evening [to] start [the] fire , [to] sit back [and] watch [a] fire [, uh ,] [to] enjoy [that] , [you] know , [and] [then] [to] get [up in the] morning [and] get [a shower] [and] get cleaned [up] , [that] kind [of] [stuff] . 
B|31| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: So [we] never really spent [that] [much] time at [the] campground as [much] as [we] did ,
