B|36| B: [I] _used _to_ be_ [in] Ohio _, it's_ _some_ pretty country [up] _there_ . 
A|37| A: Uh-huh _. Well_ [you] [kind of] _know what it's like_ , _then_ _. Yeah ._ 
B|38| B: _So ,_ 
A|39| A: _But ,_ we've [, uh ,] we've [done] [, uh ,] many types [of] [camping] . We've , we've [done] tent [camping] , _and we had_ access [to] [a] motor home which is _really_ super great , _if_ [you] [don't] want [to] _rough_ [it] _too_ [much] . 
B|40| B: [Yeah [.] You] [can] _get_ _the_ , _they_ _have some_ [nice] [camping] grounds _you know [,_ that] [have] _the_ water piped _out_ 
A|41| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|42| B: [just] set [it] [up] [and] _get_ _out_ [of] , _get_ _out_ [of] _the_ city for awhile . 
A|43| A: Right . Just [get] [you] away from [the] everyday _things_ [that] _are_ going on . [We] , _when_ [the] children _were_ smaller _we used to go_ [to , uh ,] Delaware along [the] ocean _most_ _every year_ . And [that] [was] fun [we] stayed _mostly_ [in] state parks [and [, uh] [,] we] _really_ enjoyed _that ._ 
B|44| B: Tell [you] [what] [, I'm] losing [you] . 
A|45| A: Huh ? 
B|46| B: [I] said [I'm] losing [you] , _you're_ _getting_ _you're_ fading _out ._ 
A|47| A: _Oh ,_ maybe [my] , dropping [my] phone . Is [that] better ? 
B|48| B: [Yeah .] 
A|49| A: _Oh_ . _But ,_ 
B|50| B: _So_ [what] _, you_ try [to go] [and] take [a] vacation [every year] [and] [go] _out_ [and] [camp] ? 
A|51| A: _Yeah . _Well_ [,_ we [used to] [,] we] [don't] _as_ [much] anymore , _but , uh [,_ we used to] . [We] [kind of] slowed [down] [a] [little] [bit .] _But , uh _,_ I think_ [the] worst _, the_ worst thing is _when_ [it's] raining . _If_ [you] [get] [a] _rainy_ season [and] [you] happen [to be] [camping] _then it_ [can] [be] [kind of] bad . 
B|52| B: _Yeah . I_ [know] [the] rain bring _out_ [the] snakes [or] [used to] bring _them_ _out_ [in] [the] Ozarks , 
A|53| A: Uh-huh . 
B|54| B: That's [kind of] , [kind of] [rough] [when] [you] got [to] fight snakes off [when] _your_ sleeping . 
A|55| A: [I don't] _think_ [I] would _like that [._ What] [kind] ? 
B|56| B: Uh , copperheads [mostly] , 
A|57| A: _Oh_ . Those aren't _too_ pleasant . 
B|58| B: No _, they're_ . 
A|59| A: [Yeah .] [We] [have some] [of] [them] around [here [.] You] probably [have] _more_ [there] , though [, I] would imagine . 
B|60| B: [Yeah .] One [year] _they were ,_ _they were_ [just] everywhere . 
A|61| A: _Oh_ . 
B|62| B: [I don't] [know what] _it was_ [, [we] had] [a] real [rainy] spring 
A|63| A: Uh-huh . 
B|64| B: [and] [then _it] was_ all [year] , [there] [was] [just] copperheads everywhere . 
A|65| A: Uh-huh . [But] [you] still backpacked [and] camped [out .] 
B|66| B: [Yeah . Well] [I] lived [down in] [, down in] [the] bottom [of] [a] big hollow [and we had] [to] pretty [much] hike [out] [most] [of] [the] time . 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| B: [If] [it] rained [we] [were] stuck _back_ [in] [there] . Had [a] four wheel drive . 
A|69| A: Uh-huh . 
B|70| B: [You] [just] [get] [used to] _it ._ 
A|71| A: [Yeah . I] guess [you know] _enough_ [to] look [where] [you're] walking [or] sitting [or] whatever [you're] doing . 
B|72| B: [Yeah .] 
A|73| A: _Yeah . Yeah [,_ I] would _think_ [, I] would _think_ [a] _cave_ would [be] , could [have] problems _like that_ _, too ._ 
B|74| B: [Yeah .] This [cave] [that [we] used to go] [in] [was] [little] _, it was_ small _it was_ [more] _it was_ [just] big [enough] for [a] couple [of] people [to] sack [out .] 
A|75| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh , is [your] [brother] _younger_ than [you] [or] , 
B|76| B: [Yeah .] He's [about] [a] [year] [and] [a] half [younger] . 
A|77| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh , well , that's great , that'd [be] [a] lot [of] fun [. You] [have] [a] lot _good_ experiences from _that _._ Yeah ._ 
B|78| B: [Yeah . Yeah _,] it was_ . Saw [a] few bears [things] [like that .] 
A|79| A: Did [you] _really ?_ [What] , black ones ? 
B|80| B: [Yeah .] 
A|81| A: [Yeah .] That would [be] exciting . 
B|82| B: _Yeah , the_ first , first couple [of] times [it's] pretty scary [but , uh ,] after [that] [you] realize _they_ [are] [just] [as] _afraid of you_ [, too .] 
A|83| A: [Yeah [,] they're] usually [more] [afraid of you] than [you] [are] [of] [them] , usually . 
B|84| B: [But , uh ,] 
A|85| A: They're on [the] increase [in] [this] area . 
B|86| B: [Oh , really ?] 
A|87| A: Uh-huh . 
B|88| B: [I don't] [know] [if] , _they_ [don't] [have] [them] [up] [there] [do] _they_ ? 
A|89| A: The black bear . 
B|90| B: [Yeah .] 
A|91| A: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
B|92| B: [Oh ,] [do] _they_ ? 
A|93| A: [Yeah , the] population's _been_ [really] [up] . They've [, uh ,] they've [had] longer hunting seasons than [that] even _to get_ rid [of] [more] [of] [them] , because [they were [,] uh ,] increasing so [much] . 
B|94| B: [Yeah ,] [they] [, down] [here] [they] , [they] stopped for awhile [or] [they] [really] made [it] hard [to] hunt [them] . 
A|95| A: Uh-huh . 
B|96| B: [I don't] [know what it's like] [now] [, I] haven't [been] _back_ [up] [there] [in] awhile . 
A|97| A: [Yeah .] [But , uh [,] we] [, we] [really] [like] [camping] [. [I] [,] I] must say [that] [, uh [,] we] [we] [really] [have] [a] lot [of] fun , [a] lot [of] memories [in] [that] from [camping] [and , uh] . 
B|98| B: [Well _,] it's_ [good] [to get] [out] [and] smell [some] fresh air [, too .] 
A|99| A: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
B|100| B: _So ,_ 
A|101| A: It's [just] , so [, it's] [a] lot [of] work [, too] 
B|102| B: [Yeah .] 
A|103| A: [it's] [, uh [,] [you] know ,] [getting] ready [and] taking care [of] everything . [But] [it's] , um [, it's] [really] refreshing . [So ,] 
B|104| B: [Well [,] I think] [we're] [about] [to] run [out] [of] our time . 
A|105| A: [I think] so [Well [,] it was] [really] [good] hearing from [you] [and] [I] hope [you] [get] [back] [into] [camping] again , [and] [do] [a] [little] [more] [of] [it .] 
B|106| B: [Yeah . Yeah .] [I'm] sure [, I] will . 
A|107| A: [Okay .] Thanks [a] lot , [and] [you] [have] [a] [good] day . 
B|108| B: [You] [, too .] 
A|109| A: Bye-bye .
