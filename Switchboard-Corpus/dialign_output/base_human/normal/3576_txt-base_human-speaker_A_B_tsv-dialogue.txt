A|1| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|2| B: I'll fix _the_ porch _up_ _with_ pumpkins _for_ Halloween _and_ Christmas _, but_ basically he does _all the_ heavy stuff _, _and_ I_ _do_ _all the_ fun stuff 
A|3| A: _Well _,_ we_ _have_ _it_ _just_ opposite here . My wife works [in , you know ,] at , at , at [the] T [I [,] and] she's [, uh ,] sedentary [all] day long _so_ when she gets _home_ she likes [to] _mow_ . 
B|4| B: [Uh-huh _.] I_ see . 
A|5| A: And _we_ _have_ _about_ ten acres [, and] she tries [to] _mow_ _about_ half [of] _it_ 
B|6| B: Wow . Wow . That's _a_ _, a_ big job . 
A|7| A: _Well ,_ yeah , _it_ keeps [, uh ,] well _, it's_ doing _real_ well _, because_ when _we_ got _this_ place [the [,] the] dirt _was_ _just_ overgrazed 
B|8| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|9| A: [I] _mean [,_ you know ,] _it_ _was_ bare dirt [in] _a lot of_ places 
B|10| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|11| A: [and] now [, you know ,] since _we've_ _been_ mowing _it_ _, and [,_ you know ,] [of] course _we_ water _a little_ bit _, that's_ _just_ too _much_ [to] water [all] at once [, but] [but] _just_ by keeping _it_ mowed [and] getting _it_ mulched [in ,] _we've_ reclaimed _a lot of_ _it_ . 
B|12| B: Oh , sure . Oh _, I_ bet [it's] beautiful . 
A|13| A: Yeah [, but] _we _don't_ do_ _much_ _in the_ _way_ [of] [, uh ,] _flowers ._ We _have_ _one_ _little_ flower garden [that] _we_ _, that_ _we_ work [with] . 
B|14| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|15| A: The rest [of] _it_ _is_ _just_ _like_ _wild flowers_ 
B|16| B: Wild [flowers .] 
A|17| A: [and] _in the_ summertime _we_ _get_ [the] prettiest yellow [flowers .] 
B|18| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|19| A: They're _about_ _, oh [,_ I] guess [, a] third [the] size [of] your , palm [of] your hand 
B|20| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|21| A: [and] course _in the_ spring _we_ _get_ [the] bluebonnets [and] Indian paintbrush . 
B|22| B: Oh [, that] sounds lovely . [Uh-huh .] Oh [, the] [wild flowers] _are_ beautiful _. _I_ think_ , um _, I was_ thinking [about] throwing _some_ _for_ _, in the_ back _, just_ _where_ [the] kids , um _, just_ [way] [in the] back , behind [the] swing sets _or_ _, just_ [have] _some_ [wild flowers] growing back _there_ would be [real] pretty . Then [you] [don't] _really_ [have] [to] [have] [much] maintenance involved . 
A|23| A: Yeah _. Well _,_ my_ wife [and I] [really] enjoy [that] sort [of] thing . 
B|24| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|25| A: Uh , she enjoys mowing [. I] can't believe _it_ . 
B|26| B: [Uh-huh] [, I] [know] [a lot of] 
A|27| A: [I] _mean [,_ I] hate _it_ 
B|28| B: uh-huh [, [a] lot of] women [do] . Um , I've [just] never [really] [, you know ,] maybe _one of_ _these_ days I'll [have] [to] [get] _out_ _there_ [and] [mow] [, _but] ,_ um [, my] husband takes [it] on [, and] I'll help rake _up_ [the] grass [, and ,] um , sometimes I'll help him edge , um [, because] [, [we] don't] [have] [that] [much] _property_ [, but] _we're_ on [a] corner [lot] _, so_ _there's_ [a lot of] edging _to do_ 
A|29| A: _Right ._ 
B|30| B: [and ,] um [, uh [,] that's] what's nice [about] living more [in the] country [, you] [don't] [have] [to] worry [about] _any_ [of] [that] 
A|31| A: We [don't] even [have] [any] concrete [or] asphalt . 
B|32| B: Oh . Oh [, that's] nice [, [I] _,] this_ [is] different _for us_ [because] _the other_ _, in the_ past [we've] had homes [that] haven't had [any] _side_ walks [, and ,] um [, it's] [been] [a little] more country [with] [the] _trees_ _, and _we_ do_ miss [that] . Um , if [we] had [a] chance [to] move _, I think_ we'd move back [to] somewhere [that] [was] [a little] more countrified [and] [a little] less maintenance required _as_ , _as_ far _as_ [that] goes . 
A|33| A: [Uh-huh .] Yeah [but [,] you know [,] [we] do] everything together . 
B|34| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|35| A: This [, this] spring [we] got [a] thousand pine [trees] from [the ,] actually [this] fall [, I was] talking [about] , two weeks ago [we] got [a] thousand pine [trees] from [the [,] you know ,] soil [and] conservation people 
B|36| B: Oh . [Uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [and [,] uh ,] [we're] [in the] process [of] , [of] [planting] 
B|38| B: Wow [that's] , 
A|39| A: [and] [we're] building [a] stand [, uh [,] just] [to] [the] north [of] our house [, and] along [the] east [, uh ,] [property] line 
B|40| B: Um . 
A|41| A: [and [I] [,] uh [,] I think] what [we're] , what [we're] trying [to do] [is] create sort [of] [a] wind break [because] [I] tell [you] [, in the] winter time when [that] , when [that] wind comes [out] [of the] north , [it] [just] cuts _right_ through [you] _like_ you're not even [there] . 
B|42| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
A|43| A: So . 
B|44| B: [Right [.] Well [,] I] _put_ , 
A|45| A: On [the other] [side] [of the] house _, though [,_ that's] [where] [we] [have] [all the [,] the] delicate [flowers] [and the] [mums] [, and we] [have] morning glory 
B|46| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: [and we] [have] trumpet vine [and] moon [flowers] [, and we] planted those [out] by [the] septic [, so] [that] [, uh _,] they_ [get] plenty [of] water 
B|48| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|49| A: [and we] [get] hummingbirds come [in the] spring [, you know ,] [all] summer long . 
B|50| B: Oh . Oh [, that] sounds [so] pretty . 
A|51| A: And , well , when [we] leave [the] doors open _, they_ _fly_ [in the] house . 
B|52| B: Oh [really] Do [they] , [don't do] [any] damage [, though [,] they] [just] [fly] [right] back [out] , if [you] [have] [the ,] 
A|53| A: [Well ,] yeah [, they] [don't] _like_ [it] [in] here [because] [there's] _nothing_ [to] eat 
B|54| B: [I] see . 
A|55| A: [and] when you're [as] busy [as] [one of] those babies , you've got [to] eat most [of the] time . 
B|56| B: [I] see . 
A|57| A: And [we] got [a] few [, you know [,] we] [put] [up] [some] hummingbird feeders [and] [some] bird feeders . 
B|58| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|59| A: But [, you know ,] [for the] most part [, gardening] [for us] [is] , well [, we] got asparagus [, and [,] uh ,] [we've] got [some] plum [trees] [and] [some] apple [trees] [and] [some] tomato [and] [some] blackberries [and] strawberries . 
B|60| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|61| A: Man [, we] [get] [the] best strawberries [, that] [you] [just] can't believe . 
B|62| B: Oh [, oh [,] that] sounds wonderful . 
A|63| A: We [just] got our last _tomatoes_ . 
B|64| B: Oh [, I] love [home] grown _tomatos ._ 
A|65| A: Yeah . 
B|66| B: There's [nothing] [like] _them ._ They [just] [don't] [have] [the] same ones [in the] supermarket 
A|67| A: [Well ,] [these] [are] _accidental_ [tomatos .] 
B|68| B: What does [that] [mean ,] [accidental] [tomatoes] ? 
A|69| A: [Well ,] last year [the] birds came [and] ate [a] few [of the] [tomatoes] , [of] course you're going [to] lose [some] [that] [way] 
B|70| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|71| A: [and the] seeds go [right] through [them .] 
B|72| B: [I] see .
