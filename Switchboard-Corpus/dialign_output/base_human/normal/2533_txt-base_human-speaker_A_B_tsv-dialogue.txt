A|0| A: Okay _, um ,_ _what_ _baseball team_ are _you_ _familiar with_ ? 
B|1| B: _Well _,_ I'm_ _only_ _a little bit_ [familiar with] _the_ Red Sox _because_ _I_ _lived_ _up_ _in_ Boston _for a_ while , 
A|2| A: Really ? 
B|3| B: _and _,_ um , and_ _that's_ , 
A|4| A: _Oh ,_ now come _on ,_ no Texas Rangers ? 
B|5| B: after _that _,_ if you_ asked _me_ _that_ _I_ wouldn't _have been_ able _to_ tell [you] _if_ _that_ _was_ football _or_ [baseball] . 
A|6| A: Really _? I_ guess _they_ paired _two_ women together _on_ this call [for a] reason _which is_ _something_ _we_ _can_ _think_ _about_ later _but [,_ um _,] I_ _understand_ [a little bit] _about_ [the] Texas Rangers _. _I_ know_ George _Bush_ threw _out_ [the] _first_ pitch hitter bounced _off_ [the] ground [and] [that [,] um _,] yeah _,_ I_ heard [a] joke _on_ [the] radio yesterday [that ,] [in] regard [that] _he_ _didn't_ design [the] patriot missile system [, [and] _,] uh _,_ the_ radio's kind _of_ cruel _, _I_ mean ,_ _think _,_ _the_ _,_ _he_ ,_ this chain [that] must [have been] _on_ President _Bush_ [to] bounce [the] _first_ pitch _off_ [the] ground _, _I_ mean ,_ _how_ humiliating [for a] man _to _do that_ ,_ _any_ man _. _I_ don't_ care [if] _you're_ President . 
B|7| B: _Yeah _,_ but_ _at_ [the] same _time_ _, I don't know _,_ _it's_ pretty_ far [to] throw [that] far [I] _couldn't_ _do _it_ ._ 
A|8| A: _I know_ [but] _he's_ [a] man come _on ,_ men [know] _how_ _to _do that_ ,_ _right_ ? 
B|9| B: Right _, he's_ _supposed _to_ be_ able [to do _that] ._ 
A|10| A: _I know_ _so_ [, I] felt kind _of_ sorry [for] _him_ . [that] must [have been] _hard_ _on_ _him_ [because] [he's] _just_ [a] person _but [,_ um [,] I] never , [a] major owner _of_ _our_ _of the_ _team_ here . 
B|11| B: _Oh , really [?_ _I] didn't_ _know _that_ ._ 
A|12| A: _Yeah , _he's_ like_ [, _I] thought_ _he _was_ the_ owner _but it_ turns _out_ _my_ Mom _said_ [that] [he's] _part_ owner _but he_ must own [the] biggest chunk [because] _that's all_ [you] hear _about_ _is_ [, if] _, you know ,_ _about_ Neal _Bush_ _I think_ _is_ _his_ name . 
B|13| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: See [, I] _even know_ _his_ name [because] [he's] _on_ [the] _news_ _a lot _,_ and I_ never _had_ [to] _watch_ [the] _news_ _not_ _, you know _,_ _not_ like_ _some_ people hour [and] [a] half [a] _day_ [or] anything . 
B|15| B: [Yeah [,] and] I've [been] watching [, uh ,] _my husband's_ French _and so_ [if] I've [been] watching [the] French [news] , _when_ [I] [watch] _it ._ 
A|16| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: _It's_ incentive , speaking [of] [Bush] , we're _going to_ _get [a_ little] [off] topic [but] speaking [of] [Bush] _, they_ [that] _had a_ story where [he] went [to] visit [some] [little] [, uh ,] elementary school students _, _and stuff_ ._ 
A|18| A: [Oh [,] I] saw [that .] 
B|19| B: _Did_ [you] _see_ [that ,] where [he [,] the] guy asked [him] [for] proof [of] who [he was] , 
A|20| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|21| B: _he said_ [his] . 
A|22| A: [I] _want to see_ _your_ driver's _I , _I_ , I don't_ , 
B|23| B: _I know and_ [see] [a] credit card 
A|24| A: _you're_ _not_ President [Bush] _. [I_ know and] [he said] _yeah _,_ it_ _does_ [so] fast [, I] heard [it] _on_ [the] radio _. I_ heard [the] audio portion _on_ [the] radio [in] [the] car _but [I_ didn't] [see] [it] _but ,_ 
B|25| B: It [was] [so] _funny_ [to see] _, it was_ [a] _really_ cute [little] kid _too_ . 
A|26| A: That's _about_ [my] extent [of] [, um ,] _about baseball_ [, I don't know _,] that_ _much_ _about_ [it .] 
B|27| B: _Well [,_ I] [can] tell _you [,_ that] [the] Mets opened _, I [think_ ,] [two] days ago , 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [because] [my] brother [was] _supposed to_ _go to_ [the] opening _game_ [, and I] _couldn't_ tell [you] who pitched , 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [but] [they] won [, the] Mets won . 
A|32| A: [Did] [they] ? 
B|33| B: _But [,_ yeah [,] not] [my] [a lot ,] *sp ? _by_ _and then_ somebody _else_ _lost ,_ maybe _it was the_ _other_ New York [team] [which is] [the] Yankees , 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [but _I] don't [even_ know] [if] _they're_ still New York Yankees , [or] New Jersey . 
A|36| A: That's [so] stupid [that] [you] _all_ [have] [two] teams . 
B|37| B: [Yeah .] 
A|38| A: That's [really] stupid . 
B|39| B: _Well _,_ [but_ _it] _,_ then_ [they] [can] [have] _them_ _play_ against each _other_ . 
A|40| A: [Yeah [,] [I] know] . 
B|41| B: [I think] _it's_ still [the] New York Yankees [, you know ,] 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] 
B|43| B: [I thought] [they] _were_ moving [to] New Jersey This [is] [how] [much] [I know] [about baseball] . 
A|44| A: The Texas Rangers [, they] [, they] [lost [,] I think] . 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [But] [I [know] that] _last _year_ we_ did _go to _a_ baseball game_ _last year_ . We _got_ free _tickets_ [because] _someone_ [at] _our_ church , _one of the_ deacons [at] church [, um ,] parks cars [at] The Mansion [at] Turtle Creek [which _is] like_ _one of the [,_ uh [,] the] places [and stuff .] 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: _And_ [he's] their head chauffeur _, is_ this [funny] , _as_ [they're] parking [the] cars [the] valet service . 
B|49| B: Right . 
A|50| A: [Yeah _,] he_ _makes_ good money [too] doing [that ,] you'd [be] [I] [was] shocked [, but] anyway , _someone_ gave an Iranian [a] tip [of] four Rangers _tickets_ _last year_ , 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [and then] [the] Iranian [couldn't] _, he_ [didn't] _want_ [them] _, so_ [he] gave [them] [to] Alan [, and] Alan [and] [his] Dad [had] plans [that] night [so] [they] gave [them] [to] _us_ _, so_ [he] decided [that] [some] wealthy man tipped this Iranian , [with] _baseball _tickets_ ,_ 
B|53| B: With [baseball tickets] . 
A|54| A: [and] _we_ ended [up] [with] [them] , _right_ . _And_ [so] _we_ [were] , walking [up] 
B|55| B: [Yeah .] 
A|56| A: [and I] looked [at] _my husband and I_ [said] [, you _know] what_ Kyle this [is] The Mansion [at] Turtle Creek [a] tip [I] bet _these_ are [really] good _seats [and_ so] _we_ ended [up] _on_ _first_ base _right_ down _there_ _on_ [the] floor , 
B|57| B: Wow . 
A|58| A: oh [, _yeah ,] we_ [they] called _us_ [at] five [and] [the] [game] started [at] seven [so] _we_ _just_ threw everything together , ran over [and] _got_ [the] [tickets] [and] walked [and so] _we_ took [two] _kids_ [with] _us_ [and] nobody brings [two] _children_ [in] _these_ _seats_ [, you know] _because ,_ 
B|59| B: Because [they're] fancy [seats [and] stuff .] 
A|60| A: _yeah , _and_ you_ _just_ _sit_ down _and all_ [the] girls [were] _all_ dressed [up] _you know , I_ _just_ [was] _there_ [, you know ,] _like_ [I'm] loaded [, I'm] here [, you know [,] [and] [,] uh [,] it was] _just_ kind [of] [funny] _because , you know [,_ _but] we_ _got_ [to] _sit_ [by] _first_ base [if] [they] did hit [a] ball [I] would [have been] afraid [it] would [have] knocked [my] face _in [,_ you know] . 
B|61| B: [I know] [I'm] _always_ scared [of] [that] whenever [I] [go to a] [game] [. I] rarely [go] [but we] went [last year] [because] [my] brother , [my] brother [is] impossible , _when_ [, um [,] he] [does] football _leagues_ [and] [baseball] _leagues_ [and all] _kinds of_ _stuff ,_ 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [and] [if] _there's a_ [game] [on [,] he's] watching _it . [I_ mean _,] [that's_ all] [there] [is] [to] _it ,_ 
A|64| A: Really ? 
B|65| B: _and [he's_ like] glued [at] [the] T V . 
A|66| A: _I'm glad my husband's not like [that_ .] 
B|67| B: [Oh [,] [I'm] glad my husband's not like that] either , I'd kill [him] My brother's _like that [and_ [,] um ,] [see] [he] goes [to _a] lot of_ _games_ [, not] [a] _real_ [lot [,] [but] he] tries [to] _go _,_ then_ [my] father [got] [us] [some] [tickets ,] 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [so] [my] brother's wife [and] [my husband and I] went . Last [year we] wanted [to] show [my husband] [what] [a baseball game] [was] [because , you know ,] being [a] non-American [you] [want to see] [what] [a baseball game] [is like] . 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [And] [he] describes [it] [as] [, you] [sit] [there] [in] [a] crowd [, it was] _nice_ weather [and _stuff] [,_ it] wasn't [a] _real_ problem [, but] [you] [sit] [there] [in] [a] crowd [, and] [you're] waiting [and] waiting [and] waiting [and you] eat [these] lousy [the] hot dogs [um _,] because_ [we] _made_ [him] try [a] hot dog [, you know ,] 
A|72| A: That's [funny] . 
B|73| B: [and [,] um [,] _so] you_ [sit] [there] [and you] wait [for] [the] longest _time_ [really] bored [, [and] then] [all] _of a_ sudden [something] happens [but] [you] happen [to] look [the] _other_ way during [the] _time_ , 
A|74| A: _You_ miss [the] whole thing . 
B|75| B: [yeah , [and] so] [you're] basically [you] [sit] [there] [and] wait [for] [something] exciting [to] happen [and] _when_ [it] happened [he] missed _it [,_ and] [didn't] [understand] [it] Um [, he] grew [up] [out] _, well [,_ he] grew [up] [in ,] [which is] [the ,] sort [of] O strip east [to] west , eastern [part] , 
A|76| A: That's [funny] . Where [is] [he] from [in] France ? [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [but] [that ,] 
A|78| A: [Yeah [.] I] _have a_ [, I] [had a] friend [in] college from _Strasbourg ,_ 
B|79| B: [Yeah , he's] [not] [that] far [, [he] was] sort [of] [in] between [Strasbourg [,] and] _Paris ._ 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh .] [Paris .] [And] [my] _cousin_ lives _in Paris_ [and] she's [lived] [there] [for] [like] , oh , [off] [and] [on] [for] twenty years . 
B|81| B: [Oh [,] is] _she_ still [there] ? 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: Because , 
A|84| A: _Saint Claude_ [is] [that] sound [familiar] ? 
B|85| B: [Yeah ,] [Saint Claude] , 
A|86| A: [Yeah .] 
B|87| B: [yeah , we] used [to] _, that's_ [one of the [,] um ,] entrances [to] [the] periphery [to] _get_ [in] [and] _out of the_ city . 
A|88| A: [Oh , really ?] 
B|89| B: [And] _it [,_ _it] [,_ _it] [,_ it] sits [right] [at] [the] limit , 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: [I] exactly where _she_ [is] _. _But_ , um [,_ we] met [in [Paris] .] 
A|92| A: That's neat . [Yeah ,] [she] married [and] [they] [have] _twelve_ _children_ . 
B|93| B: Twelve [children] ? 
A|94| A: She has _twelve_ [children] . 
B|95| B: [Oh ,] [my] _God [,_ the] poor woman . 
A|96| A: She looks gorgeous , no she's gorgeous [and] [she] _just_ liked _having_ _kids_ [and] she's thin [and [,] [I] mean ,] four [or] _more_ [children] are thin , 
B|97| B: Were [any] _of them_ twins ? 
A|98| A: [I mean [,] I'm] [not] kidding [you] . 
B|99| B: [You] _probably_ _can't_ afford [to] eat _if you_ [have] [more] _than_ [two] _of them_ 
A|100| A: No , _your_ [, I] _have a_ friend now [that] has seven . [And] [, um , and] [they're] [all] eight [and] under [, and] nine [and] under , 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [they're] [all] [real] young , [they're] _just_ raised [right] [that's] [what] God's told [them] [to do] [but] [they're] [not] condemning [you [,] if [you] [,] we] [only] [have] [one] child [, you know [,] they] [don't] say [, they] [don't] put [on] bad [or] anything [which is] good [because] [it] would [be] easy [, I'm] sure , [for] [them] [to _do that] , you_ [get a] conviction [like that [and] you] [think] everyone should [have] [it .] [And] [so] [I'm] [real] proud [of them] [because] [they're] aren't [really] [, they] [don't] [do that] [at] [all] . 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [You] [go] [in] their bathroom [and] [there's] ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [And] [I] [always] give her [a] _hard_ [time] whose toothbrush did [you] [really] use this morning 
B|105| B: [But] [how] [do] [they] afford [to] [even] [have] _the _kids_ [,_ uh ,] we're expecting [our] [first] baby , almost [any] [day] [Uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] They live lean [for] [one] thing [and] [they] tithe [and] [they] [it] puts [a] whole [in] _your_ money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor [God] [with] this portion [and so] [they] [, I think] [that] helps [a lot] [. [I] think] [that's] [the] key , [in] [he ,] [like] [his] sales [last year] [he] _just_ works [a] normal job . He [probably] has an income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] [last year] [he] [made] [that] [got] [him] [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand [which] allowed [him] [to] pay cash [for a] full size van . He loves [God [,] [I] mean [,] [it was] the] biggest thing [that] [any] [one] [in] this company [had] ever done , 
B|107| B: Wow . 
A|108| A: [and] [he] [got] [to [do] it] [and so] [God] _just_ [really] blesses [him] [in] ways [like [that] ,] [do] trust [God] [because [,] I don't know ,] [kids] are [a] blessing [and [,] and] [some] people [you know [,] we] [think] [of] blessings [as] [nice] furniture [and] things [like [that] [,] but] [kids] are _just as_ [much] [of a] blessing inside [these] material things [but] [it's] [a] different kind [and] [a lot] times people [think ,] oh [, well [,] I'm] [not] blessed [I] [have] an old car [. But] you've [got] five [kids [,] you know ,] 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [you're] _just as_ blessed , [probably] [more] [, because] [if you] follow this , [there's a] good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING , [by] Richard Fugate 
B|111| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [and he's] [, you know ,] [a lot of] wisdom [in] [it .] [And] [the kids] [at] BIBLE talk [about] anything [but] training [, and] training [is] different [than] anything [else] [in ,] [in] psychology doesn't address [it .] A [lot [of] the] psychology [stuff [,] the] good [stuff] [that's] [in] psychology [it] _just_ comes [out of the] BIBLE [and] [they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out of] [it [,] but] [the] things [that] work [in] psychology [other] [the] years [that] they've proven [to] work [, they] _just_ come [out of the] BIBLE [and so] this book [it] _just_ [really] [all] [these] things [and] [how] [to] train [the] child [so] [they're] [not] [going [to] be] [a] curse [to] [you] [when] [they're] thirteen . 
B|113| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: What [I mean] [how] [to] train [them] [so] [they're] [going [to] be] [a] blessing [and so] [, you know [,] they] [do [that] and] [they] [, they] _just_ live lean [pretty] [much] [they] [don't] , [she] doesn't shop [at] _Foley's_ [you know [,] and stuff] [like [that] [.] But] [a lot] women die [or] shop [at] _Foley's_ [so] things , 
B|115| B: [I [, I don't] [know] what] [Foley's] [is] 
A|116| A: [It's] [like] [a] Macy's , kind [of] store , 
B|117| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|118| A: [it's pretty] [nice] [and] everything's [pretty] expensive [and [,] you know [,] you] _just_ [can't] [do [that] [and] you] [don't] [go to] [baseball] [games] [as] [much] [or] [you] [get] pictures [like] [we] did . [You] [know what] [I mean] ? 
B|119| B: [Yeah .] 
A|120| A: [You] [do] [these] fun things [, you know ,] [in] [other] [kinds of] ways [and [I] know] Manhattan's [real] expensive _but [,_ um [,] it's] kind [of a] different situation [because] [you're] [probably] living [in] an apartment , [right] ? 
B|121| B: [Yeah [,] well [,] that] [makes] [a] [really] big difference [. _But] [,_ [but] ,] still [it's] [just as] [hard] [as] [having] _, that ,_ 
A|122| A: [Yeah .] 
B|123| B: [but] [your] [cousin] _could_ [have [a] [baseball] team] [with] [twelve] [kids] 
A|124| A: [Well ,] church softball [leagues] [, so] , 
B|125| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|126| A: [they're] [not] [all] boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have a] girls' league [because] [I'm] [the] [one] [that's] [supposed to] start [one] [and I] [just] haven't gotten around [to] doing [it . I] keep saying [we] need [to] [have] [one] . They [go ,] okay [, then] start [one] [. But] everybody wants [to [do] it] [but [,] you know ,] God's sitting [on] [my] heart [and I] [just] hadn't gotten around [to] doing [it [,] but] anyway [, so] [they] [could] [really] [only] [have] four members [on] [the] [team] [. [I] think] [they] [only] [have] four boys [. [I] don't even] [think] [they] [have] [but] [two] old enough [to] [play] yet . 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: [But , um [,] then] [you] [didn't] believe [me] [about] her [kids] *listen: this [and] utt2 [as] [one] utt are [the] [they] are [so] good . [I'm] [not] kidding [you] [but] [she] [does] work [with] [them] [and] [it's] [a] commitment [and [,] that [,] that's] [what] [they're] called [to do] . 
B|129| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|130| A: [I] [have a] , most [of] [my] friends , 
B|131| B: [I] admire [someone] [that] [can] [do that [, [you] know ,] I] [really] [can] . 
A|132| A: [I [know] , I] [do] [too] [, [I] ,] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four [kids] [and] [they] feel [like] [, you know [,] that's] [really] why [God] [and] [some] [of the] people [in] [our] church use birth control [and] [some] [of them] [don't] [, I] [had] [my] tubes tied [so [you] ,]
