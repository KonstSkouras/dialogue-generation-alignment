A|0| A: _Well _,_ I_ don't _know_ if _there's_ going _to_ be solutions _to_ _the_ U S budget . 
B|1| B: [Well ,] _now_ _it's_ _in_ pretty disastrous shape _for_ _sure ._ 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: It's _only_ _getting_ worse exponentially _it_ seems . 
A|4| A: Yes . Exactly . 
B|5| B: Um , 
A|6| A: There's _, uh ,_ _maybe_ some short-term things _that_ they can do _and_ [it] hurts everybody's pocket , _of_ course _, but_ _, um _,_ I_ _know_ _that_ _state_ has _, uh ,_ cutback _, uh ,_ raises [for] _a_ year _to_ help _, uh ,_ _the_ _, uh ,_ _state_ financial _or whatever_ _you_ might want _to_ say _to_ get better [in] _a_ better condition . 
B|7| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|8| A: That , 
B|9| B: Oh , which [state] _is_ [that] ? 
A|10| A: _Uh ,_ State _of_ Minnesota . 
B|11| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: So _there's_ _the_ potential [that] perhaps _, you know ,_ _the_ U S budget might want _to_ take _a_ _look at_ [it's] _, uh ,_ federal employees _or_ , _and_ take _a_ _look at_ saying , _well ,_ let's freeze wages . _I mean_ everybody's doing [it] so [it] isn't _like_ _, uh ,_ private business has had _to_ do [it] 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: so [it] might _have_ _to_ be _something_ [that] they might consider doing as _a_ _that's_ got _to_ be very short term . 
B|15| B: Right . Right . 
A|16| A: _And_ _the_ [only] other avenue [that] _I_ can _think_ _of_ [is] _, uh ,_ looking _at_ where they're spending _the_ _money_ _and_ _not_ so _much_ as saying , _well ,_ we're spending _too_ _much_ [in] [that] area as perhaps looking _at_ what [is] costing them _the_ _money_ . As [for] _, for_ instance _, I think_ _you_ _probably_ remember _the_ military [getting] caught _, um ,_ with toilet seats [that] _cost_ them four hundred , five hundred _dollars_ . 
B|17| B: Yep . Right . 
A|18| A: _And_ _it was_ just _, _I_ mean_ _you_ can go _to_ K-Mart _and_ _buy_ them [for] _, uh ,_ eight _dollars_ _or_ _I think_ six _dollars_ _or whatever_ [for] toilet seats , 
B|19| B: Yeah . 
A|20| A: so . So [it] gives _you_ idea _that ,_ 
B|21| B: Yeah . Definitely [I think] [that] [there's] [probably] _a lot of_ waste [in] defense [and] [in] _government_ funded research [in] [the] first place . 
A|22| A: Sure , [sure .] So , 
B|23| B: [I mean] _there was_ [, um ,] _people_ [at] Stanford who _were_ soaking _the government_ [, you know ,] _using_ millions [of] [dollars] [of] research [money] [to] [, uh [,] for] [the] President [to] [buy] beach homes [or whatever] [it was] . 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh _.] Uh-huh ._ 
B|25| B: _And [I_ think] [that ,] [that] [maybe] _more_ widespread _than_ [well ,] _than_ we'd [like] [to] [have] _think ._ 
A|26| A: Than we [think .] Sure . Sure . 
B|27| B: But [, but] _then_ [it's] [something] [that's] hard [to] enforce [too] _I'm [sure_ .] 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] It [sure] [is] . The [, you know ,] as far as _, I think_ [there was] [something] with [the government] official [that] went on conferences [for] two days [and] actually [, uh ,] [the] conferences [were] nothing [but] [, uh [,] you know ,] they're [getting] paid [for] this , [and] [it was] [something] [more] [than] just [the] conferences . They [were] [using] [it] as eating out [, uh ,] _when you_ [think] _about_ [people] [, uh ,] taking vacations these big [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: The rest [of] them taking these vacations [and] [using] [the] taxpayers' [money] [for] [that] . 
B|31| B: Right . 
A|32| A: [And] [it's] [a] real big crunch [, uh] 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [of] course , _when_ they get caught [then] they're [, you know ,] they're guilty [of] course [, but] [, uh ,] during [that] time [I'm sure] [there's] hundreds [of] [, uh ,] thousands [of] [people] [that] are [, uh ,] spending [money] [that] does _not_ belong [to] them . So , 
B|35| B: [Well ,] [that's] right . [Uh [,] I think] [that ,] oh , politicians talk _a lot_ [about] waste 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [but] [I'm] [not] [sure] _that that's_ really [that] [much] [of] [the] problem . 
A|38| A: Sure . 
B|39| B: [I mean] [when you] [look at] [something] [like] [the] Gulf War [it] [cost] us God knows how [much] . You [know ,] [at] [a] million [dollars] _, a_ pop [for] patriot missiles . 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh .] Exactly . [And I] don't [think] [, uh ,] [it's] ended up being [, [I] mean] [it] gave [people] jobs 
B|41| B: Yeah . 
A|42| A: [but] [I think] [it] also [cost] [, um ,] quite [a] bit as far as because after they're done with [the] war [, [a] lot of] things [were] no longer put [to] use . [I mean] [it was] kind [of] [like] , okay , we'll do this during this point [and] time [but] after [that that's] [, you know [,] uh] they didn't want [to] do [it] anymore . 
B|43| B: Right [. Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: So [, [a] lot of] things [that] are saying [that] they're no longer going [to] be doing [for] next wars [that] are coming up [that] they did [for] this one [in] [getting] rid [of] [a lot of] things . So [I] don't [know] . 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
A|46| A: _Okay_ , [well ,] [it was] good talking [to] [you] [and] [have] [a] good evening . 
B|47| B: [Okay] All right . You [too] . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh] , thanks . 
B|49| B: Bye-bye . 
A|50| A: Bye [now] .
