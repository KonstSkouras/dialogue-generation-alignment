A|2| A: _And_ _, uh _,_ _I can't_ really_ talk too much about _the problems _with_ , uh ,_ _public education_ _in_ detail _because_ _the_ _school_ _system_ _I went to was , uh ,_ _really_ superb even though _it_ _was _a_ public_ _school_ _system_ .

A|4| A: Oh . _Okay_ _. Yeah ._ 
B|5| B: _And _I_ ,_

B|7| B: [Okay] _Uh ,_ I've , [the] [high school] [I went to was , uh ,] [was _a] good_ one also _. And _I_ ,_ _well_ _, I guess_ [you] _could_ say one _of [the_ problems with] [the] [public education] [system] _is_ _the disparity_ between different schools . Because [the] one [I went to was [,] you know ,] _I'm sure_ _a , a_ lot nicer _than_ [, you know _,] a_ lot _of the_ _inner city_ schools _and_ [the] things _around_ Atlanta . 
A|8| A: [Yeah _.] Yeah ._ [was [a] , [a] ,] it's _more_ or less [a] suburban [school] [system] ? 
B|9| B: [Yeah .] 
A|10| A: Yes . _That _,_ that_ [was] _true_ _for_ mine too . [Uh ,] although [I] [I'm sure] [to] _some_ extent _, that_ _money_ [is] part [of _the] problem_ _in [the_ disparity] , _but I_ don't _think_ [, I] honestly don't _think_ _that's_ [the] biggest part [of] _it_ . _You know , _I_ think_ _that , uh _,_ I mean_ [I] [know] [that] [in] [my] town [, you know ,] most [of _the] ,_ most [of the] parents , _they're_ valued _education ._ 
B|11| B: What 
A|12| A: [And] [, uh] [you know ,] [and] so [the] students were [, you know _,] to_ _some_ extent , motivated _to learn_ . 
B|13| B: _Yeah , that's true ._ 
A|14| A: _I mean_ [know] 
B|15| B: _Yeah . And_ [I'm] also _I mean [,_ _in] the [,_ in] those places where [, uh ,] [like] [the] economy [is] [really] bad _, they_ might [, you know ,] _be_ [more] tempted _to [,_ to] quit _school and_ _get_ jobs _and that_ kind [of] _thing_ [because] _they_ need _the , you know ,_ [money] [to] put food on [the] table [and] stuff [like] [that] . More _than_ _they_ _would_ [you know [,] in] areas where _they_ 
A|16| A: [Yeah , that's true _.] But_ _but_ [, uh [,] _I] think_ _, I mean_ even [more] [than] _that ,_ even _, I mean_ if [you] drop out [in] [high school] [you] should _still_ [be] able _to read_ [you know] ? Which _it_ [I mean] _it_ sounds _like [,_ uh ,] 
B|17| B: Uh-huh [. Yeah .] That's [true .] 
A|18| A: [now] _I think_ maybe it's _started_ changing [in the] past few years [because] [, uh [,] they] _have_ [of] these [, uh ,] sort [of] mandatory tests if [you] _have_ [to] take before [you] [get] [a] diploma . 
B|19| B: Right . 
A|20| A: _But , uh ,_ _but_ [, uh ,] certainly before _that _,_ there_ were _people that , you know ,_ [would] graduate from [high [school] and] [could] barely _read_ . [Uh ,] [and] [that's] just sort [of] inexcusable [and] [you] _can't _really_ _,_ _I , I _,_ I_ mean_ [I] just _can't_ even picture how _that could_ happen . _You know ,_ except maybe [to] someone whose [, you know ,] [really] badly _learning_ [, uh ,] disabled or something . 
B|21| B: [Yeah .] 
A|22| A: _But_ these _people_ obviously weren't . 
B|23| B: That's hard [for] me [to] say since [I] didn't [, I] didn't [really] grow , _well_ when [I went to] _elementary_ _school it_ _, it_ wasn't [in] [a] great area [but I] [still] _, I mean , I_ learned [to read] , [started] [learning] [to read] when _I was in_ kindergarten [, you know] . 
A|24| A: [Yeah .] 
B|25| B: So _I guess_ [I can't really] [I can't] say _what_ [it] [would] [be] [like] _to [,_ uh ,] grow up [in] [a] [really] oppressed region 
A|26| A: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
B|27| B: [You know _, I] guess_ [the] whole , [the] whole environment [and] attitude towards [school and] [learning] [is] different [for] [the] [people] . 
A|28| A: [Yeah [. And] _I] think_ [that's] almost [a] bigger factor , [than] anything else probably _. [I mean_ , I] don't [, _I] think_ [you know ,] [people] just , 
B|29| B: So _, I guess_ [the problem] [is] [the ,] [the] _thing_ [to] _do_ [is] [to] try _to [,_ uh [,] _to] get_ [some] kind [of] motivation [to learn] [and] , 
A|30| A: [Yeah . And] , again [, I] don't [, I mean] _got_ [know] [the , you know ,] how qualified [, I mean , _I] think_ it'd [be] interesting [to [,] you know [,] to] spend [a] couple [of] days just looking [around] an [inner city] [school] . [Uh [,] you know ,] sort , sort [of] maybe from [elementary] through [, uh ,] [high school] . [You know ,] just sort [of] [to get] [a] [feel] [for] [what] it's [like] . 
B|31| B: Uh-huh [. Yeah .] Uh-huh . 
A|32| A: _I think_ that'd [be] an interesting experience _. But , uh [,_ I] haven't done [that] 
B|33| B: No [, I [, I] can't] say [that] [I] [have] either [. But , uh ,] 
A|34| A: [But] [I] [do] [, I] [do] _think_ _that , uh [,_ I mean ,] [public education] [in] general _I think_ can work [. And _I] think_ it's [a good] [thing] . 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] I've , I've heard [some] [, I mean] I've heard statistics [and] things _that , that_ compare [a [public] education] [to] [a] private [education [.] I mean] within [like ,] within [the] same [, uh ,] income groups . 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] 
B|37| B: If [you] compare [the ,] [like] [the] [people [that] _could] have [,_ [that] _could] have_ sent their kids [to] private schools [and] [the] [people that , you know ,] [the] [people [that ,] uh ,] _did_ send their kids [to] private schools . 
A|38| A: Yes . 
B|39| B: [I think] [they] compare [you know ,] fairly _well ._ 
A|40| A: [Yeah [.] [Yeah [.] [I] mean] , I] don't [, I] honestly don't [really] [think] [I] [could have [,] you know ,] done much better [than] [I] [did] [in the] [school] [system] [I was in] . [mean] 
B|41| B: [Yeah . [I] [, I , I] ,] [my] schools [, I mean [,] [there] [,] I] [have] [a] lot [of] _once_ _, once_ [it] seemed [I got] _into_ _high school [,_ they] had [a] lot _of , uh ,_ accelerated programs [and] _all_ kinds [of] stuff [like] [that] . 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] 
B|43| B: [That [,] I mean _,] that makes_ [a] big difference cause [I] wondered when [they're] taking classes [with , uh ,] [with] [people that] are [really ,] are interested _in the ,_ [the] subject [and] stuff [like] [that] . 
A|44| A: [Yeah [. [I] mean] ,] [and] [and] [in the [,] once] [you] [junior] [high] [, uh ,] start [junior] [high] , starting [in] eighth grade [all] [the] way through [high school [,] there] were four levels . Well , no [, I guess] [it] [in] [junior] [high] [, it] [was] [still] three . Then [in] [high [school] it] changed [into] four levels [of , uh ,] [of] instruction [in the] major subjects . [Uh ,] which , 
B|45| B: Uh-huh . 
A|46| A: [I mean ,] actually [I think] [that] works pretty [well .] [and [that] [, that] makes] ,
