B|25| B:  _. Yeah _._ [I_ know] [that] they've _, they're_ looking _at_ [, uh [,] uh _,] you _know_ [,_ uh _,] you _know_ ,_ better [running] automobiles . 
A|26| A: _Uh-huh . Yeah_ , I've seen _that ._ 
B|27| B: Uh , _some_ _things_ [they] [do] , _one_ [of] them [is] _they're_ using corn [in] fuel . 
A|28| A: Huh . 
B|29| B: [You] ever heard [of] [that] ? 
A|30| A: Huh-uh . 
B|31| B: [Yeah .] Methanol ? 
A|32| A: Huh . No 
B|33| B: [Yeah _.] Well_ _that's_ [big] up [here] because [of] _the_ [, they] grow [a] lot [of] corn 
A|34| A: [Oh [,] yeah] [Yeah .] 
B|35| B: Uh _, that's_ _one_ thing [that] [they] [do] . At [that] _, it's pretty_ easy [to] [do] . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [And] _the_ [, uh ,] unfortunately _, it_ still contributes [to] global warming cause [, you] [have to] _, you _know_ ,_ wipe out forests [to] grow corn [and] _things_ [like] [that .] 
A|38| A: [Yeah] [, that's] true . 
B|39| B: It _doesn't make sense ._ Uh , _but_ [it's _, you] _know_ ,_ _one_ [of] _the_ most [, uh ,] productive crop [in] _the_ world [is] corn . 
A|40| A: [Right .] Huh . _And ,_ [of] course [, I] doubt if _there's_ _any_ [, you] _can_ buy regular anymore _. You_ buy unleaded . [Right] ? 
B|41| B: [Yeah .] 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] Huh . 
B|43| B: Drive cars [with] catalytic converters _, and_ all [that .] It's interesting . They're _, they're_ looking _at_ [, there's] _some_ work being done _on_ [, uh ,] automobiles [that] are electrical powered 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [And [, uh] _,] they're_ looking _at_ [where] [you] [have] [a] battery operated car basically , _but_ [it] has _a , a_ engine [in] _the_ back [that] charges [it .] 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _So_ _the_ engine kicks _on_ _when_ _the_ batteries need power [and] [it] turns off . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: Interesting thing about gas [is] _when_ [, I mean] , about battery powered cars [is] _when_ you're _at a_ stop light , you're [not] using [any] [any] energy 
A|50| A: Huh That [is] _good_ . 
B|51| B: Unlike [a] car [where] [it's] [running] . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: _A_ electric car [it's] _on_ demand _. [I_ mean] [it's] either _on_ _or_ off . 
A|54| A: [Yeah .] 
B|55| B: Basically . 
A|56| A: Huh . 
B|57| B: [You] [don't [have] to] shift _So_ [you ,] cars become _very_ simple all [of] [a] sudden _too ._ 
A|58| A: [Oh] . 
B|59| B: Very interesting . 
A|60| A: That would be nice [. I] think [I] saw [that] [on] T V [one] time . They , maybe [it] [was] C N N [where] [they] were demonstrating [that .] Or _something_ similar [to] [that .] 
B|61| B: [Yeah .] There's [, there's] [a] race [in] Australia [with] solar powered cars . 
A|62| A: Huh . 
B|63| B: [And] Ford [and] General Motors [and] all those compete . 
A|64| A: _But_ [what] [, I] think [that] [was] [a , [a] , a] setback . That [they] [, I] [don't] [know [,] they] went [, I] [don't] [know ,] how many _miles an hour [._ I] think [like] 
B|65| B: [Right [.] Yeah] 
A|66| A: [I] [don't] [know] . Huh . * See note above

A|68| A: [Yeah] [, and] [they're [,] they're] [very] expensive [too .] .

A|70| A: _Well [,_ yeah [.] Yeah .] 
B|71| B: Kind [of] interesting [so] [see] . 
A|72| A: _Well [,_ it] [doesn't make sense .] Because if [they] want [people] [to] convert [, you know] . They should [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh . Yeah] It's top speed [is] [something] [like] eighty [miles an hour _.] So_ [it's] [a] [good] , [good] vehicle . 
A|74| A: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] Um [. Well] I'll tell [you] . Sometimes [it's [,] it's pretty bad] [here] . Like today [I] think [it] [was] [pretty bad [.] I] [don't] [know] if [it] [was] , if [it's] [just] [, uh , the] allergies [or] [what] [but] [some] days [it's] [very] nice [here] downtown 
B|75| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|76| A: [and] other days [it's] [just] [really] [bad] , [so] [, I] [don't] [know] [. So] [what] , [what] kinds [of] [things] did [you] experience [in L A] [when] [you] were [there] ? Or _can_ [you] remember ? Were [you] [there] [at a] ? 
B|77| B: [Oh [,] I] wasn't [there] [too] long ago . Uh .

B|79| B: [Well [,] you [know] ,] [going] over [the] hills [, you [know] ,] coming into [the] valley ? 
A|80| A: [Yeah .]
