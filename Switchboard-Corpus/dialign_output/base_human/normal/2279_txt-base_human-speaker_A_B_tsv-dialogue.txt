A|11| A: Baseball has started . 
B|12| B: [Oh ,] okay . Do , _do_ [they] play _like_ _, uh ,_ _like_ _does_ _the_ [eight] _year old_ play _baseball_ ?

B|14| B: _Okay _,_ and _,_ and_ _in_ , _in_ his league _do_ _they have_ _like_ [a] pitcher _, or_ _do_ _they _have_ a_ standing ball _or_ [a] machine _, or_ [what] ? 
A|15| A: Up until _, it's_ coach pitch , until [you] _get_ nine _which_ [my] _little_ boy will [be] nine [in] May .

A|17| A: [So] _he's_ going _to be with_ [, uh ,] regular pitching 
B|18| B: [Oh ,] okay . 
A|19| A: _and my_ _eleven_ [year _old] ,_ _of_ course _, you know _,_ is_ pitching . 
B|20| B: _Yeah ._ _I _,_ I_ used [to] play soccer _when I was_ _that_ age _up_ [in] New York , 
A|21| A: Uh-huh . 
B|22| B: _so ._ 
A|23| A: _But_ yes , we're into [baseball] [, and] _it_ seems [like] soon _as_ [that] over [with] _we_ _get_ into basketball . We even [have] peewee basketball _here _._ So_ _there's_ _always_ _something ._ 
B|24| B: _Yeah [,_ and] _how_ about , _how_ about [like] _on_ _the_ weekends . Do [you] _do_ [sports] _or_ _do_ [you] _go_ _out_ ? 
A|25| A: Both . If we're _not_ [doing] [sports] _we_ [go] somewhere . 
B|26| B: Do [you] _go ,_ _how_ about [like] _for_ [, uh ,] _do_ [you] [go] _for_ long vacations , [like] [a] week _or_ [something] _when _they_ have_ school off ? 
A|27| A: [Oh _,] yeah _,_ yeah _,_ yeah_ . 
B|28| B: In _the summer_ _or_ [like] _in the_ Easter _time_ , [like] around _now_ ? 
A|29| A: _No ,_ usually [in [the] summer] [time] . 
B|30| B: _And_ where _do_ [you] [go] ? 
A|31| A: Different _places_ every [year] . We , 
B|32| B: Have , [have] [you] _been_ _out of_ [the] country ? 
A|33| A: _No_ 
B|34| B: [Oh ,] okay _, well_ , first , [they] [always] say , [get] [to] [know] your country first _before_ [you] _leave_ _, I mean_ _I _,_ I_ lived [in] [places] , [like] 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . 
B|36| B: _when I_ lived [in] _Washington_ [, uh ,] _Washington_ , D C _, I_ _never_ _went to the_ _Washington_ _Memorial [,_ and] _then_ _when I_ _went_ back [to] visit _, I_ _went to the_ _Washington_ _Memorial_ . 
A|37| A: _You know _,_ I've_ heard _, we_ [have a] _couple of_ _friends_ [that] goes [to] [Washington] quite often [, _and] that_ must [be] [the] _thing ._ They really hadn't either . They [went to the] [Memorial _,] you know , [when_ _they] [go_ _,] it's_ [on] business 
B|38| B: Right . 
A|39| A: _it's not_ really _just_ [to] _getting_ [to] sight _see_ . 
B|40| B: Right . [Well [,] it's] [, it's] [a] beautiful city . 
A|41| A: [Oh [,] I] bet _it_ _is ,_ too . 
B|42| B: [But] , [the] problem [is ,] [like] first [time] [I] [went] _out of_ [here] _, and they_ took me [to] Las Vegas 
A|43| A: Uh-huh . 
B|44| B: [and that] _was_ [the] most boring place [on] earth . 
A|45| A: [Oh _,] now_ [my] husband _and I _,_ we_ [go] different [places] _. But_ our _but_ [when] _we_ [go] [with] our [children] _we_ usually kind [of] _stay_ close . 
B|46| B: _Yeah ._ Did [, uh ,] did , [like] , did [you] [go] [to] Disneyland ? 
A|47| A: [Oh ,] yes , yes , yes . 
B|48| B: [Oh ,] okay [. So] _, but_ um [, now] [, I] _don't_ [know _,] but_ um _, but_ let's [see] _, when I was_ [eleven] [I] [went] _also_ [to the] Caribbean . 
A|49| A: [Oh] . 
B|50| B: _and [,_ uh ,] _then_ _after_ [that] [, [I] _,] my_ sister lives [in] Turkey , _so_ _when I was_ [like] fourteen , fifteen [, I] [went] [, I] [went to] Turkey . 
A|51| A: [Oh ,] 
B|52| B: _And_ _this_ Christmas [, I] [went to] Turkey [. But] basically [, it's] [a] , _for_ [the] past [couple of] _years_ [, [I] ,] since [my] parents [are] , [are] _, well_ , I'm from Argentina [, [and] my] parents live down there [. So] , all [the] traveling [I] _do_ [is] alone . 
A|53| A: Uh-huh . 
B|54| B: _And_ [, uh [,] we] were _never_ _much_ [of] [, uh ,] [a] _very_ [, uh ,] family [thing] [, you know ,] made , [like] [go] skiing [in] Vermont _or_ [something .] 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . 
B|56| B: That _was_ [, uh _,] that_ _was_ [a] lot [of] fun . 
A|57| A: Yes . 
B|58| B: [But] _, what_ happens [is] [we] used [to] fight [a] lot , _so_ [there's] _never_ _much_ [of] [a] family family [thing .] [You know ,] one [of] those hell family vacations . 
A|59| A: [Oh ,] yes [, but] [we] _try_ _, you know , I_ _try_ [, my] husband [also] , we're involved [in] _everything_ our _kids_ [does] 
B|60| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|61| A: _because [,_ uh _,] my dad_ died _, you know [, when_ I was] less than _a [year_ old] 
B|62| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [so] [I] [always] _just_ _had a_ mother [. So] [I] [always] thought [, when _I] have _kids_ _,_ you know , I_ really _want _to_ be_ involved _with them_ . 
B|64| B: [Well [,] my dad] , all he , all he wanted _to do_ [was] [get] _money_ _for_ _us ,_ [so] he could buy _us_ material _things_ . 
A|65| A: Material [things] , yes [, that] [is ,] yes , 
B|66| B: _And_ [, and] [to] me [, you know [,] it's] [like] [, now] I'm twenty-two [, but] [I] _still_ feel [, you know [,] it's] [like] [yeah [,] we] _never_ threw [a] football _or_ [something] 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| B: [and] [the] way [I was] brought _up_ [, and] he wants me [now] , he , [like] he [, you know ,] [like] he wants [to be] best [friends] [now] 
A|69| A: Best [friends] [, [now] .] 
B|70| B: [and] [it's] _very_ hard _for_ me [because [,] you know [,] it's] [like] [you] grow _up_ [to be] twenty _years_ [old [,] and] [it's] [always] [the] same man 
A|71| A: Uh-huh . 
B|72| B: [and] _then_ suddenly he sees [that] [he's] [getting] [old [,] and] he wants [to be] best [friends] 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] 
B|74| B: _but [,_ uh [,] you know [,] it's] [like] [, I] _can_ only express myself [so] _much_ , [because [,] you know ,] um , [everything] [that] he taught me [, you know [,] that] [my] family taught me , [which] [is] _very_ hard [to] change [that] all [of] [a] sudden from one [year] [to the] next [and] say , I'm sorry _, you know ._ It's [like] [, you know , _I] love_ [you] [and] let's [go] _out_ [and] _do_ [things] together [when I] _don't_ feel [like] [it] [, you know] 
A|75| A: Uh-huh . 
B|76| B: [and] [so] [, that's] [that] whole [thing] [that] he'll say [when] , [like] , [like] [I've] seen [my] uncle [and] his family [, you know ,] [does] [everything] together [, and] [you know ,] his [kids] [are] [, you know , when] his [little] girl [was] [five] _years_ [old] [and] [everything] , [they [,] uh ,] [they] [would] [go] [to the] beach [, and] she could [go] [to] sleep [at] two [in the] morning [you know] 
A|77| A: [Oh ,] uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|78| B: _and [,_ uh [,] [I] was] brought _up_ [the] same way _, it_ doesn't [matter] [what] age _you have_ , [just] [so] long [as] _you can_ [get] _up_ [to] [go] [to] class [the] next morning [, _you] can_ [stay] _up_ [you know ,] 
A|79| A: Uh-huh . 
B|80| B: [but] his _, what_ he [does] [is [,] when] he _gets_ home , he separates his _work_ from his house . 
A|81| A: [Yeah [,] [you] _have] to_ 
B|82| B: [Yeah .] 
A|83| A: _I mean , you_ honestly [do] _. Now_ _I have_ [friends] [that] [I love] [to] death _, but [,_ and [they] have] [children] [, but] their [children] [does] anything [, we] _have to_ take _them_ [, and [,] you know] [to do] [it] . 
B|84| B: [Yeah .] 
A|85| A: [And] [that] really [gets] kind [of] aggravating [after] [a] while [because] _you're_ _saying ,_ _Well , I_ [work] full [time] too [, you know .] 
B|86| B: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] but [,] uh [,] it's] [just] [, it's] [just] [something] [that] [, you know [,] my] theory [is [,] you know , when] [, when] [you [have] kids] [and] all [you] [, you] [want [to] do] _, well_ _, what_ I'll [do] [is [,] you know ,] [like] _, [I mean ,_ you] might [have] problems [, but] [it's not] your kids' problems [you know ,] 
A|87| A: [Yeah _,] oh [,_ yeah] . 
B|88| B: [and] [you] got [to] [try] [to be [with] them] [as] _much_ [as] _you can_ [and] [to] [, you know ,] [like] , [thing] [is [,] [is] [,] that] [, you know ,] [like] _if_ _, if_ [they] [would] ever happen [to] [have a] drug problem , suppose [, that] [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] [saying [,] I] got [a] problem [you know ,] 
A|89| A: Problem , uh-huh 
B|90| B: [and [,] uh] [and that] [would] make any parent feel _good_ [and] bad [at] [the] same [time] [, you know ,] 
A|91| A: [Yeah .] 
B|92| B: first [of] all [you're] coming [to] me [and] let's [see] _how_ [we] _can_ [get] rid [of] [the] problem [, you know [,] and] [that's] [uh [,] that's] _very_ [, that's] _very_ hard [to do] , [because] once [you're] best [friends] [with] your parents , _then_ [, I] think [everything] [go] [a] lot better . 
A|93| A: Uh-huh [, yeah [,] I] agree [with] [you] [very] [much] [so _.] Now_ [, we] waited several [years] [before] [we] started having [children] [because] [we] [was] [still] [in] _college [,_ and] [we] knew [time] wise [, or] [, and] [money] wise , too 
B|94| B: [Yeah .] 
A|95| A: [would] [, it] [would] [not] [have] [been] [a] [good] idea [to] _had_ [them] [then] . 
B|96| B: [Yeah [,] my] [, my] father [was] raising four [oh] _well_ , three [kids] [before] he [had] me , [so] [it] [was] [, uh [,] you know ,] [you're] trying , [to] support [, uh ,] four [kids [,] and] [it's] pretty hard [you know ,] 
A|97| A: [Yeah .] 
B|98| B: [and I [,] I] told him , listen [you] could [have] [had a] lot [of] [money] _if you_ [would] [have] only [had] two [kids] . 
A|99| A: Uh-huh [, yeah] . 
B|100| B: He says [yeah [,] but] [then] [I] wouldn't [have] [you] [, I] [go [,] yeah [,] but] [then] [you] [would] [have a] lot [of] [money] 
A|101| A: That's _right _,_ but you_ can't take [this] [money] [with] [us ,] though 
B|102| B: [Yeah .] 
A|103| A: [that's] [how] [I] keep _looking_ [at] [it] . 
B|104| B: [But] [, you know ,] [like] , four _, I mean_ four [children] [is] expensive , especially [when] [you] consider [like] , especially _for_ me , [which] I'm paying _out of_ state tuition . I'm paying [, you know ,] three thousand [, no _,] what_ [is] [it] , two thousand six hundred dollars _for_ one semester . 
A|105| A: [Oh] . 
B|106| B: [And] [, you know ,] people say [, you know [,] it's] expensive [to] think [it's] [college [,] but _,] if_ _, if_ everybody [would] [be] [a] [little] bit responsible [, you know [,] it's] [like] _, what_ [does] [it] _, what_ [does] [it] cost . It costs [five] hundred dollars [a] semester suppose [. Now] [they go] [to] [a] state [college] [and they] live [at] home [you know ,] 
A|107| A: Uh-huh . 
B|108| B: [and] _well_ [, it] costs two hundred dollars _for_ books [, but [you] know ,] seven hundred dollars [a] semester , [a] lot [of] people _can_ spare [that] _if_ [they] planned ahead [, you know ,] [like] 
A|109| A: [Oh [,] yeah _,] if you_ [if [you] can] [, yeah] . 
B|110| B: [I mean [,] it's] [like] [, if you] plan [a year] ahead [, [you] can] probably save _up_ seven hundred dollars [you know ,] one thousand four hundred dollars [to] send your child [to] [college [,] you know .] 
A|111| A: [Yeah .] [What] [are you] learning [to be] ? 
B|112| B: [Oh , oh ,] excuse me ? 
A|113| A: [What] degree [, I mean [,] what are you] wanting [to do] [after] [you] _get [out_ of] [college] ? 
B|114| B: [Well , [I] ,] I'm [doing] computer science , computer engineering . 
A|115| A: [Oh [,] _that's] [,_ my] husband's into [, uh ,] computers . 
B|116| B: [Yeah [,] and [,] and] [now] I'm [looking] _for_ [a] job [before] [they [have] to] send me back home 
A|117| A: Uh-huh . 
B|118| B: [because] since I'm an international student , [they] [want to] send me back [to] Argentina . 
A|119| A: [Yeah .] 
B|120| B: [Well [,] my dad] wants me [to] [go] back [. So] . 
A|121| A: [And] _you don't_ [want to] ? 
B|122| B: [No] . 
A|123| A: _No [,_ no] . 
B|124| B: [No ,] [because] [if you] [go] back there , [then] [you can] _never_ [get out] . 
A|125| A: [Oh] . 
B|126| B: Like [you don't] [have] any [money] [to] , [to] , [get out] . 
A|127| A: [Oh] . 
B|128| B: [So] [, uh [,] and [,] uh [,] [I] was] thinking [, you know ,] [like] , [Oh] [my] God [, you know , I] [go] back there [, and] [then] [, [and] I] [get] married there [, and] [now] [I have kids] there [, and] [then] I'll _never leave_ [the] place [, you know .] 
A|129| A: Then you'll [never leave] . 
B|130| B: [Yeah [,] I] [know [,] and] [that's [,] that's what] happened [to] [my] brother . He came [to] school _up_ [here] [, and] [then] [when] he [went] down there , he [was] [just] [so] bad off [, you know] from [not] being able [to] [stay] _up_ [here] [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
A|131| A: [Oh] . Uh-huh . 
B|132| B: [So] . 
A|133| A: [Well] maybe [something] will open [up] [for] [you] . 
B|134| B: [Yeah [,] I've] [been] calling [a] lot [of] companies . There , some [of] [them] [are] interested . [Well ,] [at] least [for] [a year] [and] [a] half [I] [can] [work] , 
A|135| A: Uh-huh . 
B|136| B: [so .] 
A|137| A: [Well [,] well] [I've] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|138| B: All [right ,] same [here .] 
A|139| A: [Okay ,] bye-bye . 
B|140| B: Bye-bye .
