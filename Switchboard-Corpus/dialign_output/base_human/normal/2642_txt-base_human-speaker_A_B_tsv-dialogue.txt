A|0| A: Okay , _how_ _do_ _you_ _feel_ _about_ _them_ ? 
B|1| B: _Well , I_ keep trying _to get_ _away_ _from_ [them] _, I used_ _to use_ _a lot of_ _credit cards_ _I guess_ _for a_ while _I_ _would_ _use_ _, you know _,_ a_ variety _of the_ Visa _and_ _the_ MasterCard _and_ _the_ _stores_ _, _but I_ think_ _I , I_ impulse buy _too_ much _with_ [them] _or_ _I_ buy things _, you know , I_ _see it_ _on_ sale _and _I_ _think_ _,_ oh _,_ it's_ _on_ sale _I _have_ _to_ get _it_ , _and_ I_ _really_ _don't_ need _it or_ _I_ _really_ haven't budgeted _for it_ _so_ _, um _,_ the_ last couple _of_ years _I_ _really_ _have_ tried _not_ _to _use_ them_ _at_ _all_ . 
A|2| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|3| B: What [about] _you ?_ 
A|4| A: [Well _,] we_ [have] _this_ philosophy _, we_ _use it_ _when_ _we_ _go_ _off_ somewhere [but] _we_ _pay for it_ as soon as _we_ _come_ _back_ [, you know ,] as soon as _we_ [get] _our_ _bills _,_ we_ _pay it off ._ 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _And_ _we_ only [have] _one_ . We tore _all the_ rest [of] [them] _up_ . 
B|7| B: _okay ._ 
A|8| A: Because _I don't_ _like_ [credit cards] [for] _one_ _thing [, you know ,_ I] _mean_ , _they're_ _okay [,_ [I] guess] _, if_ _you're_ _on a_ trip _or something_ _, you _don't_ [have_ to] take [a] _whole_ bunch [of] [, you know ,] _cash_ [with] [you] , 
B|9| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Right ._ 
A|10| A: [but _I] don't_ _like_ using [them] _because_ _I've_ seen [too] _many_ _people_ _that_ [used] _them and_ ended _up_ bankrupt [or] [on] , chapter thirteen [and] _stuff_ _like_ _that ._ 
B|11| B: _Huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: Because _they have_ _this_ weird opinion _that_ _if_ _you use_ _that _card_ _,_ you _don't_ [have_ _to] pay for _it_ ._ 
B|13| B: _That's_ true [if] [, if] _it's_ [on] _the credit card_ [it] doesn't seem [like] _it's_ _money_ _out of_ _your_ pocket . Sometimes [you] _may_ _think _, well , I_ don't have_ [the] _money_ _so_ [you _use] _the credit_ card_ _it's_ [like] fake _money_ [or _something] ._ 
A|14| A: _Yeah _,_ yeah_ [, and] [it] gives [you] _a [,_ um [,] a] false sense [of] security [or something] [it] seems [like] _because you_ _say _,_ oh [, well ,_ I don't [have] _to] pay for _it_ now but_ _you're_ _going _to_ [have_ _to] pay for [it ,_ and] [it] seems [like] ... 
B|15| B: [Yeah [,] you] _think [, well , I_ don't have] [it now but] payday will _come and_ _then_ _I'll have_ [the] _money_ . 
A|16| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: _But_ _that's_ probably paying [for] things [that] _were_ still owed _from_ last _time ,_ 
A|18| A: [Right .] Are [you] married ? 
B|19| B: _Yes_ . 
A|20| A: _Oh _,_ [okay_ .] [Well , I] [know] [that] [a lot of] young _people_ [, you know , [I] _,] it_ took _me_ _a long_ [time] [to get it] through _my_ child's head [, I] _mean_ _, that_ _was_ her goal [, you know _,] uh ,_ _got _to_ have a_ [credit _card] ,_ 
B|21| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: [but] [now] [that] she has _one_ , she's only [used] [it] _one_ [time] [but] she wanted [to] establish _some_ [credit] , 
B|23| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: [but I think] [it] _finally_ sunk _in_ [, you know _,] because_ she saw _some_ [of the] other _people_ [and] _just like_ she heard [them] _say [,_ you know [,] well [, I] used] [a] [credit _card] _._ And_ _my_ husband's sister _is_ [the] world's worst _at _,_ oh , well , I'll just_ [use _the credit] cards_ [and] she has _all of_ her [credit cards] _up to_ [the] limit . 
B|25| B: _Huh ._ 
A|26| A: _You know [,_ and] I'm , I'm thinking woman , wake _up and_ smell [the] roses before _they_ [come and] [get] [you] . [But] ... 
B|27| B: [Right .] Besides [the] fact [that] [how] much _interest_ _you pay_ [and] _then_ [this] ... 
A|28| A: [Right] [, and] _people_ [don't] [see] [that] either . 
B|29| B: [Yeah _,] _this_ thing_ _that you_ thought _you got on_ sale , _by_ _the time_ [you] [get] done paying [with] [that] [with] [all the] finance charges [because _you] [pay_ it off] over [a long] period [of] _time ,_ you've spent [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] _money_ [on] [that] [thing] . 
A|30| A: [Right .] The only _one_ [that] _we _,_ we_ [have] [that] _we_ kept _was_ [the] Discover _card ,_ 
B|31| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [and] [it] pays [you] [to _use] _it_ _._ I_ _mean_ [, if] [you pay] [your] _bill_ [off] _right_ [away] [, if] _you don't_ ever [have _to] pay_ _any_ [interest] [on] [it] _because they_ give [you] [a] certain _amount_ _every_ [time] [that [you] _use] [it_ ,] 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _and you_ make [that] [money] as [long] as _you don't_ ever [have _to] pay_ [them] _any_ _, uh ,_ [interest] . Now _it's [,_ and] _people_ _say [,_ well [,] you know ,] I'm making [money] [by] using [this] [credit _card] [,_ but] _they_ [don't] _realize that_ [if] _they_ [, I] _mean_ _, it_ only takes _one_ [time] [for] [you] [to _use] _it_ _and_ not_ [pay] [the] [interest] [, I] _mean_ [, _you] [have_ _to] pay_ [the] [interest] , [not] _pay it right off_ , 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [that's] _going to_ take _up_ _what_ [you] [would] [have] made . 
B|37| B: _Huh ._ 
A|38| A: _So_ [that's] [the] only reason [that] _we_ kept _that , we_ debated [for [a] long] [time] plus _they_ [don't have] _that [,_ um ,] _charge_ [on] [it _,] you know , like_ ... 
B|39| B: Service _charge you_ [mean] ? 
A|40| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|41| B: Yearly fee _, yeah ._ 
A|42| A: [Right .] They [don't have] _one_ [of] _those_ _. So _,_ [it_ _,] we_ decided [that] _was_ [it [,] you know [,] _and] [,_ I] [mean] , everybody calls us [and] wants [to] give us [a] [credit _card] ._ We _have _,_ we_ could [have] [credit cards] running down _our_ ears . 
B|43| B: [Oh [,] you] [get] [that] [stuff] [in] [the] mail [all _the] time_ . 
A|44| A: [Yes] , yes _. _And_ then_ _, [I'll_ _have] ,_ _just like _,_ uh ,_ department [stores] . They'll call _me_ _up , you know [,_ _and] I'll_ _say ,_ _look_ [, I don't] _want_ [the credit _card] [,_ well _,] we're_ _just_ _going to_ _send_ [it] _to you_ _, you know , you [don't_ [have] to] ever _use it_ [if] _you don't_ _want_ [to] . They'll _send_ _me_ _any_ [credit _card] [,_ I] tear _it up_ _. I_ _just_ _can't_ [see _it] ._ 
B|45| B: What [I] _really_ hate [in] [the] mail _is like_ [for] [the credit cards] _that I_ [do] [have] still [, _that] they_ [send] [you] these things [that] [look] [like] checks , 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] _Yeah ._ 
B|47| B: _and they_ [say ,] hey [, you know ,] two thousand dollars [, you know ,] _free_ [to you] _kind of_ [thing , you know ,] [all] _you [got_ to] [do] [is] [go] [cash] [those] things [and] you've [got] [a] short term loan [. I] hate [it ,] 
A|48| A: [I] [know] [it , _and] [you_ know] _what_ ... 
B|49| B: _I can't_ believe [they have] [the] nerve [to] [do] [that .] 
A|50| A: What's [really] bad [about] [those] though [is] _just like_ young _people_ [if] [they] _don't _, you know ,_ we_ take [the time] _to , you know ,_ help _my_ daughter , she's [in] college , 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [but] [it [,] _this] is_ her _first_ [credit card] [thing [,] well ,] _when_ she [got] her _first_ _one_ she _was_ [so] excited [it] _was_ unreal . Look [at] [this] [they] sent _me_ [this] [money] [, you know] _. So_ [then] _when I_ explained [to] her , [look] _you [have_ _to] pay_ [this] _back [and_ they] are _going to_ [charge you] [interest] [, and] [stuff] , [of] course , she tore _it up_ . [But] [a lot of] _parents_ [would] [not] take [the [time] [,] you know [,] [and] they] wouldn't even [think] [of] [it or] their kids [may] [not] be as close as _my_ daughter [and I] are [, _and] , uh , you know _,_ they_ [may] [not] even discuss _it , they_ [go] _out and_ [cash] their check thinking _that , you know ,_ they've [got] [something] , _maybe_ they've won [something _.] You know ,_ somebody sent [them] [something] [free] . 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: _And_ [go] _out and_ spend _it _._ And_ [, um [,] _it's] just_ unreal [. I] [mean] [, I don't] [like] [credit cards] [, I] wish [that they] [would] [come] _up_ [with] _some_ other _way_ _to _, you know ,_ the_ only _way_ [you] could [use them] [is] [if] [you] [were] _, like_ [on] vacation . They [would] let [you _use] it_ _maybe_ once [a] _year_ _. You [know ,_ I] [mean] , [of] course [, [I] guess] _some_ _people go_ _out and_ spend their _whole_ entire limit [on] [it] [like] [that] [at] [that] [time] _but [,_ um _,] I have_ seen _so many_ _people_ _and I _have_ a_ friend _right_ [now] she _just_ [got] [off] [of] thirteen . She [got] _, uh [,_ [I] can't] remember _what_ she called [it [,] it's] _some_ [kind of] , _maybe_ [it's] sure [or something] [like] _that [,_ it's] [something] [, it's] _some_ weird name [of a] [credit _card] ,_ 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and] she [is] charging [out of] her mind already _. And_ I'm _going _,_ you just_ [got] _off ._ [That's] [how] [you got on] [to] [it] _to start_ [with] [, you know ,] _what_ [is] [the] matter [with] [this] person , 
B|57| B: [Yeah .] 
A|58| A: [But] [, um _,] it_ seems [like] _people_ _just , you know _,_ they just_ [think , well , _I] can_ _just have_ _anything_ _I want_ _. And I_ _just_ [don't] [see it] [like] [that .] Of course [, I] _always_ [see] [pay] [the] _bills_ _first_ [and] whatever's leftover _, that's_ _what_ _you _have_ [,_ _but] [,_ um ,] _maybe [a_ lot of] _people_ [don't] [see it] [like] _that [,_ but [I] can't] stand owing [. I] [mean] [, I] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe [something] _like [,_ you know , [I] guess] _it's just_ [because] _I've_ _been_ brought _up_ [like] [that .] [But] [, um [,] I] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that _I] was_ _going _to_ [have_ _to] pay_ [this thing] [out] [for] ever [and] _maybe_ suffer [from] _having_ [to] payout . [But] _, that's_ _just_ [the] _way_ [I] _feel_ [about] _it ._ 
B|59| B: [Yeah [,] [I] think] [it's [,] it's] somewhat [a [,] uh ,] symptom [of] [our] , [me] generation [and] [that , we] [think] [we] need [all] these things [and [I] think] [my] [parents] [always] [, you know _,] did_ without [or] saved [up [to] , you know ,] buy things [and] [we] consider [that] [so many] [of] these things [we] [just [have] [to] [have] [,] you know , like] [when I] [first] [got] [my] apartment [and [I] was] setting [it up] [I] _did_ try [to] economize [some] [but [,] you know , [I] was] [just like [,] well [, I] [have] [to] have] [it] [all] furnished [and I [have] [to] have] [all of] [my] kitchen setup [and [you] [don't] , you know ,] [do] without [too] much [and [,] you know [,] that's] [how] [I] [got] started [kind of] [with] setting [up] [a] household [all] [up , you know [,] it] [kind of] [like ,] [in] [the] short [amount] [of] [time] [. You [know [,] you] [just] [have] [to] have] these things [just , you know ,] [have] [them] _at home_ , [have [to] have] [them] [at] [my] own place [and] [that's] [, you know [,] a] big expenditure [to start] [, um ,] buying [all] these things [that you] [think] [or] , [or] [have [to] have] [and] actually [they're] [kind of] luxuries [or] [you] should save [up] slowly [and] keep buying [them [and] not] [just] rush [out and] furnish [the] [whole] place [, you know ,] [going] [in] [one] big swoop , save [up and] [then] buy [it .] 
A|60| A: [Right .] [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [But] [we're] [not] into [that .] We're into [like ,] [have [to] have] [it] [all] [now] . 
A|62| A: [oh [,] yeah [.] [I] guess] [it] [is like] [that] though [because] [it] seems [like] _more_ [and] _more_ _people_ are [like] [that .] [But] [, um [,] [I] guess] [it's] [because] I'm older [, I] [mean] , I'm [not] real old [but I] am older [and [,] um [,] you know , I] didn't _feel like_ [that I] didn't _feel _like_ I_ _had_ [to have] everything [. [I] guess] [it] [was] [because] [, well , I] _had_ everything [when [I] was] [at home] [but [I] [, I] don't] [know] why [I] didn't . 
B|63| B: [Well [,] we're] geared [to] [that .] We're [like [,] [okay] [,] [like] [I] want] [a] living room set [. And] instead [of] sitting [back [and] [,] and] [going [,] [okay] [,] well [,] it's] [going to] cost [maybe a] thousand dollars , two thousand dollars [and I'll] save [for] two years , 
A|64| A: uh-huh . 
B|65| B: [people go] [, oh , well , I'll just] [go] buy [it ,] put [it] [on] [credit] [and] they'll [pay it off .] 
A|66| A: [yeah .] 
B|67| B: People aren't tuned [in] [to] [like] saving [for [it] and] [then] buying [it [, they] just] put [it] [on a] [charge] [card ,] put [it] [on] account [, and] [then] [pay] [off] [the] [bill] [because they] [want] [it now] . 
A|68| A: [Huh .] 
B|69| B: It's [always] [have [to] have] [it now] . 
A|70| A: [Yeah [,] well [,] it] didn't hurt [you] [, did] [it ,] [to [,] I] [mean] [, you] didn't [go] [out and] [charge] [a] [whole] bunch [and] lose everything [, did] [you ?] 
B|71| B: no , no [, but [I] have] [had] [some] times [when] [I've] [had] [some] pretty good balances [on] there [and , uh [, you know ,] I] [finally] [, you know ,] paid [them] [all] [off] [and] thought [this is] [, you know ,] [kind of] nonsense [. So [,] we] [don't [,] uh ,] [have] big balances [on] [them] [at ,] [all] [now] [we're] [, we're] [, you know , [we] [,] I] [use it] occasionally [but I] [pay it right [off] .] We're ... 
A|72| A: [Yeah [,] well [,] you] learned [then] , [right] ? 
B|73| B: [Yeah [,] you] learn [the] [, you know , the] hard [way] [, you] hate paying [all] [that] [interest] [and] [I've] never [been] [one] [to] itemize [on] [my] income , tax [and] never [had] enough [to] itemize [and] [so] [it's just] [a] big chunk [of] [money] [and you] [realize that] [you're] [not] buying [anything] [on] sale [your] paying , [so] much [more] [for] [that] item [, because] you've [got] finance [charge] [and] [the] cost [of] [having] [that card] [every] [year] which [is] [what] , forty dollars sometimes [just] [to have] [the] [card .] 
A|74| A: [Yeah .] 
B|75| B: [That's] [, [a] lot of] [money] [that you] went [to] buy [this] item . 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [And then] [you] never [feel like] you've [got] [anything] [to] [to] put into savings [or] [anything] , [you're] [always] [just] paying [bills ,] paying [bills [,] you know , you don't] [feel] [that [you] have] [any] extra [to] save [. And I] hate [, I] hate living paycheck [to] paycheck [. I] [like] [to have a] little there [, you know [,] [that] [I] can] , save [so] [I can] [feel] [that , you know [,] if] [something] comes [up] [I've] [got] [the] [money] [to pay for it ,] .
