A|17| A: _I like it ._ 
B|18| B: Uh-huh . 
A|19| A: _I like _it_ [,_ uh ,] part [of] _my_ problem _is_ [I have] small children [, so] [, uh ,] _to do_ [a] whole _lot_ _just_ requires _a lot of_ _, oh ,_ coordination as far as scheduling [and] _that_ type [of] [, uh ,] deal [, you know [,] uh ,]

B|24| B:  , _yeah ._ 
A|25| A: [yeah .]

A|27| A: You _feel_ _it ,_ [don't] [you ?] 
B|28| B: Uh-huh . 
A|29| A: It's amazing how [, uh ,] how much [, uh _,] it_ changes _, and [I_ weigh] probably [about] [the] same [I] weighed [for] _, oh [,_ _I] don't know_ how many years _, but_ [, uh [,] it's] changed places _And_ things [don't] fit _just_ [quite] exactly fit [the] same . 
B|30| B: _Yeah_ . Uh-huh . 
A|31| A: [But [,] uh [,] so] [, do you] _do [,_ uh ,] _in_ Texas [, uh ,] _does_ _there_ , probably [quite a] few [facilities] . 
B|32| B: _Yeah ,_ [there] _are_ . Um [, I'm] living _in a_ dorm [right] now [, and] [so] [right] downstairs _there's a_ facility . [And] [I] _really_ [feel] _kind of_ guilty [for] [not] working [out] _more_ than [I do] because _there's a_ facility [right] downstairs where _all_ [, you know ,] _all_ we _have [to_ do] _is ,_ _is [,_ uh ,] run down [there] 
A|33| A: [Do [you] enjoy _it] [,_ or] [is] _it [,_ uh] . If [you] can [have] , find [the] time [it's] _just_ [the .] 
B|34| B: Uh-huh [yeah] [, I] _really_ [do ,] because [I like] [to] _get_ [, you know ,] _get_ off alone [and] [just] _do that_ [for] [a] _while_ [, but] [that's] [hard] [, you know] . 
A|35| A: _Yeah , it is_ [hard] 
B|36| B: Uh-huh . 
A|37| A: _it is_ [hard] . It's [, uh [,] like] anything else whether [or] [not] [you] want [to] sacrifice _another_ half hour . 
B|38| B: Uh-huh . 
A|39| A: My problem [is] [I don't] want [to] wake up _another_ half hour earlier [and] [do] [more]

A|41| A: Don't [get] enough sleep as _it [is_ ,] [right] 
B|42| B: Uh-huh , [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|43| A: [and , uh ,] [kind of] [have] , [if] you're having [the] pressures [of] _school_ [and , uh ,] everything else [, [it's] kind of] , course [it's] [really] [, you know ,] as soon as [you] [do] _it [,_ it's] [really] [a] release . 
B|44| B: Oh , [yeah .] 
A|45| A: You [feel] invigorated [and] [you] [feel] _oh [,_ you] [feel] [in _a] lot better_ shape [just] [like] _eating_ [right] foods . 
B|46| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] ready [to go] [another] twelve hours . [Yeah ,] [yeah .] 
A|47| A: If _I eat_ very much sugar , boy , [just] _does_ something .

A|55| A: [Well ,] [there's _a] lot of_ [fat] [in] [meat] . 
B|56| B: Uh-huh , [yeah] [, that's] [it [,] _I] mean [,_ that's] [about] where almost _all_ [of] [the] [fat] comes from 
A|57| A: Right . 
B|58| B: [and] [so] [. I] found [that] [really] helps . 
A|59| A: [And] unless [you] [really] [like] [, uh ,] _fish_ . Fish [is] [pretty] _good_ [for] [you [,] but] [, uh] .
