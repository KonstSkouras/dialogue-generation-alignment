A|34| A: [Well [,] [I] , actually] _I don't know_ [a lot] [about] different brands [.

B|35| B: [What] [was] [that] ? 
A|36| A: [It] [, it] turned out [to] be [a] _, a_ Chrysler . [Uh] Lancer . 
B|37| B: Huh [, stick shift] , huh ? 
A|38| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|39| B: Did [it] [have ,] [what] [, a] _three_ _speed_ [or] [a] four _speed_ ? 
A|40| A: _No [,_ a] five [speed] . [And] [it ,] basically [, it] [was] something [that] [a] military [guy] [had] ordered [and] hadn't picked [up] [, and] [so] [it] [had] [been] [on the] [lot] [three] months [and] [they] were [really] eager [to] sell [it] . 
B|41| B: Wow . 
A|42| A: So _, I guess_ [in] this area , at least [, you know , if] [it's] [not] automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|43| B: [Well [,] actually] [, I] much [prefer] [a stick shift] [and ,] [what] _, [I'm_ _,] I'm_ curious [. [I] , [I] know] [why] [I] love [a [stick shift] .] Why [why] [did] [you] [want] [one] ? 
A|44| A: [Well [,] I] [just] wanted [it] because , again [, I] [had] _, I guess_ traditionally always [had a car] [that] [had] [one] [and] [I] thought [it] would be _more_ reliable . 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [Uh ,] 
B|47| B: It's hard [to] [find] [stick shift] _cars_ _anymore ._ 
A|48| A: [I] found [that] out [. _I] mean_ [, you know _,] the_ people would [just] sort [of] look at [me] [like] [, you] must be crazy [when] [I ,] went [in] [to [,] and] asked [and] [that] [was] [a] requirement [so ,] 
B|49| B: Huh , yeah . 
A|50| A: So , 
B|51| B: [No , [I] mean] most [of the] _sports cars_ [are] [stick shift .] 
A|52| A: [Well [,] I'm] [not] even [sure] _all_ [of] [them] [are] [anymore .] At least [in] this area . 
B|53| B: Huh . 
A|54| A: Not [that I] [was] [looking for] [sports _cars] [,_ but ,] now [the] people [I've] talked [to] _don't_ seem [to] [have] [stick shift .] 
B|55| B: Huh . 
A|56| A: [And] [so] [why] _do_ [you] [like] [stick shift] ? 
B|57| B: [Uh [,] I guess [I] , I] grew [up] [on] [it] [and] [it's] fun . It's , [it's] [an] enjoyable part [of] driving [. I] [do] feel [like] [I] [have [,] uh , more] control over [the] [car] 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and] [it [,] [it] ,] [to] [me] [, it] gives [me] [more] [, [a] lot] [more] control [in] snow [and] ice [and] slick conditions . 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|61| B: [Uh [,] [it] [,] it] does [, uh , [I] don't [know] [,] [it] ,] [it's] [really] [more] fun than [anything] else . As _long_ as you're [not] stuck [in] heavy traffic , [it's] fun 
A|62| A: Right [, and] [actually] [it's] [probably] safer [on] [, you know ,] at [long] trips because [it] keeps [you] [more] active . 
B|63| B: [Yeah] , yeah 
A|64| A: So , 
B|65| B: [Yeah] [, uh ,] [of] course [, I like] gadgets [and [,] [and] , uh ,] fun things , [on the] [cars ,] which [are] [all] [the] things , course [, the]
