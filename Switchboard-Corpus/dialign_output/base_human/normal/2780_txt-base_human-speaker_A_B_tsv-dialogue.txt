A|0| A: _Yeah_ _, _I_ think_ _, um_ , _this_ _is a_ tough subject because _, uh ,_ _when_ _you_ come from _two different parts of the _country_ _,_ uh ,_ _the_ political views _are_ really _different_ . _I_ _, uh , I_ _, I_ guess I've _had_ _to_ discuss _a_ number _of_ _what_ might _be_ considered controversial issues , 
B|1| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _I_ guess _like_ , _like_ they're _nothing_ _, I_ guess , _nothing_ _is_ _as_ awful _as_ abortion _but_ _like_ _gun control_ _and_ _, uh ,_ _day_ care an things _like_ _that_ _, and_ _there_ _are_ some _very_ _different_ views _, uh _,_ _of_ the_ people connected _with the_ program _which_ _I_ thought _was_ really interesting _, _you_ know_ . 
B|3| B: _Well_ , _now_ [you] [, you] _say_ [two different parts of the country] [what] , [are] , [are] , [are] [you] referring _to yourself_ _or_ , 
A|4| A: _Yeah_ _, well_ being _in_ , _in_ Baltimore see , Maryland _is_ _, um_ , _is_ sort [of] _, um_ , _is_ _as_ , _as a_ hub [of] liberalism _you know_ , compared _to [the_ _country] _,_ uh [,_ _you] know_ , _very_ _, uh ,_ _in_ , _in_ many ways _, uh ,_ _very_ _liberal_ _very_ somewhat [to] _New_ England _though_ Pennsylvania _and_ _New_ York _, uh , I_ , aren't actually _as_ _liberal_ , Maryland _is a_ _very_ _liberal_ _, uh ,_ state _so_ , _so_ , where _here_ _we have_ _, um_ , _we have_ _gun control_ laws _we_ probably _have_ some [of the] strictest _gun control_ laws _in the_ nation _and_ most people _in_ Maryland vote _for_ _that_ [, _you] know_ . 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: So _, it_ really _is a_ [different] _, um_ , 
B|7| B: _Uh _,_ well [,_ of] course [, you] _talk_ [gun] controls _down_ [here] [in] Texas [and] you're asking _to be_ lynched . 
A|8| A: _Yeah_ , _that's_ , _that's_ _right_ [talk] [to] _, I_ _had_ [to] [talk] _about_ _gun control_ _with_ somebody _and I_ talked _with_ _a_ woman who actually [, _you] know_ , _had_ _just_ purchased _a gun_ _that_ _day_ _, and_ _was_ going target shooting [, _you] know_ , 
B|9| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [and] _it_ _was_ _very_ [different] _it_ _was_ _a_ whole , [different] view _. It's_ really _, um_ , _this_ _has_ opened _my_ eyes [to] thinking [, _you] know_ , at _one_ time _I_ _just_ sat [here] [and] thought [, well ,] how _can_ anybody _believe_ _that_ because I'd really never met people _that_ _did_ _, and_ _now _,_ I_ [talk] [to] people _that_ _do ._ So _that's_ _, it's_ really interesting . 
B|11| B: _Well_ [, it's] _very true_ , [now] _I'm_ _a [,_ uh ,] [New] Yorker by birth . 
A|12| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: Although [I] claim Florida [as] [my] home [now [,] uh , I] [have] [two] sons living _down_ [there] _but I_ _also_ [have] [two] sons living elsewhere , [one] [in] Tennessee , [one] [in] Mississippi . 
A|14| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: _But I_ lived [in] [in] Florida [for] ten _years_ [and I] kind [of] [like] [it] _down_ [there] _, but they_ [had] [a [gun] control] law [which] went [a] little bit _too_ far . 
A|16| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|17| B: _I think [uh_ [,] well] [in] _your_ words , _they_ were [a] little bit _too_ [liberal] . 
A|18| A: _Yeah_ , isn't [it] funny . 
B|19| B: _I mean_ _they_ _they _I_ believe_ _if_ _I'm_ correct _I believe_ _they_ permitted _their_ carrying concealed weapons . 
A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: _But_ _they_ [uh] quickly [did] away [with] _it ._ 
A|22| A: [Uh] . _Yeah ._ 
B|23| B: _I think [in_ the] next session _they_ _they_ [uh] modified [it] [but] [it's] _still_ legal [to] _own_ _or_ _possess_ weapons [in] _uh uh_ Florida . 
A|24| A: _Yeah_ [well] [you] _can_ [possess] 'em [here] [too] [but] They _have [to_ be] they're registered [and] [Uh ,] [like] [uh] [the] [the] Brady Bill _that's_ currently being discussed nationally [and] whatever _is_ [very] [well] supported [here] , [in] [gun control] avenues , 
B|25| B: The [the] [one] week [uh] _seven day_ [the] delay 
A|26| A: _You_ [have] [the] [seven day] waiting period . 
B|27| B: _Uh huh ._ 
A|28| A: _Yeah_ 
B|29| B: _Well_ _I don't_ mind [that] _too much_ 
A|30| A: _that's uh_ _that's_ 
B|31| B: _I'm_ _I'm_ [with the] N R A _myself_ . 
A|32| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|33| B: _And_ [uh [,] uh] Really [the] _only_ objection [we have] Is _uh _you_ you_ _give_ [a] little [and] next _thing you know_ _somebody's_ trying [to] take more . 
A|34| A: _Yeah_ _that's_ [true] _that's_ [very true] That's [and] _that's_ [the] way [I] guess most [of the] _um_ [the] political organizations work [you know] [the] same [I] [know] [the] abortion issue [with] _right_ [to] life [and] _right_ [to] choose 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: [and] [and] both [of] them [are] both want [the] extent [of] extremes _so_ [that] [they] [don't] [give] anything [for] [a] balance [you know] there's there's always [that] difficulty 
B|37| B: _Well_ _then_ _tell_ _me_ _do you_ _consider_ _yourself_ [a] [liberal] ? 
A|38| A: Um [I] _would_ [say] [I'm] probably [liberal] _yeah_ 
B|39| B: _Well_ let _me_ ask _you this_ _then ._ 
A|40| A: _yeah_ Sure 
B|41| B: How [is] _your_ [what] [is] _your_ feeling [about] _uh uh_ expressing _yourself_ by _burning the_ American _flag_ ? 
A|42| A: [Well] I'll [tell] [you] . _I [I_ think] [you know] [if] [they] [if] [they] didn't [give] [as] [much] coverage [to] these idiots [that] _burn _the_ flag_ _, it_ _would_ never happen [do [you] know] [what] [I mean] ? 
B|43| B: Huh . 
A|44| A: _It's_ [only] because [they] make [a] big stink over [it .] [But _I] I_ guess actually [I believe] [that] [if] somebody wants _to burn _the_ flag_ [I] guess _that's_ [their] opportunity They're they're they're _right_ [in the] sense [of] _freedom of speech_ [But I] _would_ never 
B|45| B: [Well] [now] wait [a] minute [there] 
A|46| A: [Yeah .] 
B|47| B: [you] [just] said [it [.] It's] [their] [right] by [freedom of speech] ? What does [speech] [have _to] do_ [with] _burning_ [a] [flag] ? 
A|48| A: [Yeah _.] Well_ [it's] [that] [they [I] think] [the] idea [of] [freedom of speech] goes _back to_ [and I] [uh uh] [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] being able [to] display [your] [uh] [your] ideas [you know] [the] [what] [the country] stands _on_ America stands _on_ [is] [that] [they] _can_ [do] [that] [Uh ,] _though_ [I] _would_ never _even_ [consider] [it] [in] [a] million [years] [to _do] it_ [myself] _I _I_ [I_ think [uh] [you] know] [but _I] I still_ [what] _the flag_ stands [for] [I] guess _to me_ [is] [that] [if] somebody wants [to] voice [their] opinion [or] display [their] opinion openly [and] [if] [that] _is a_ [a] way [that] [they] _can_ show [their] opinion [then] [they] _should be_ allowed [uh] 
B|49| B: Now [uh] [Well] [I I still] go [back to] ... 
A|50| A: Unless [the] _burn_ unless [the] actual fire hinders [somebody's] health [and] well-being [you know] [but [I] [I] think] _that's_ [I] guess _that's_ [I] _that's_ [my] opinion [Yeah] [I] guess [you] feel differently . 
B|51| B: Then [would] [you] condone [the] _burning_ [of the] capitol building ? 
A|52| A: [Uh ,] no [but [I] think] _that's_ _that's uh_ [it's] _that's_ taxpayer's money . If somebody buys [their] [own] [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] _that's fine_ [but] [that] _that's_ [you know] _that's_ destruction [and] [of] [uh] _public property and_ whatever . 
B|53| B: [Uh ,] [then] _you don't_ draw [a] line between [public property and] [uh [uh] uh] [what] [a] [public] [uh] _symbol_ . 
A|54| A: _No_ [I don't] [know] [I] guess [the] symbolism oh [I think] [what] America stands [for] _is the right_ [to be] able [to] _disagree_ [with the] government . 
B|55| B: [Uh] [yeah] 
A|56| A: [Uh] [I think] _that's_ what's made democracy 
B|57| B: [but] [here] again [I] go [back [to] the] second amendment [You] _can disagree_ by [freedom of speech] [which] , [has] [nothing] [to do] [with] action . 
A|58| A: _Yeah . Uh-huh ._ [Yeah _.] Well_ _that's_ _that's_ [true] 
B|59| B: Now [I] am [I] am adamantly against _that ._ 
A|60| A: [Yeah] [But [I] think] [I I] [Yeah] [I [I] I] guess [the] idea [you know] [they] always keep saying [like] [the] framers . Um . [there] [uh] [one] [of the] Republican [the] appointees [for] [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] always [talk] [about] [they] feel [that] [this] person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what] [the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set [down] . 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [And] Um [I believe] [that] [the] idea [of] [burning _the] flag_ [is] [is] [in] 
B|63| B: _huh ._ 
A|64| A: [my] understanding [of] how [it] _was_ framed [is] [that] [you this] [the] [thing] [about] _this country_ [is] [that] [you] [can disagree] [with] its government [and] [you] [can] display [that .] 
B|65| B: [Yeah . Uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [Uh [,] I] [Yeah] [, I] [and] [and] _so_ [that] _as a_ [freedom of] expression [and] [speech] [and] whatever [I [I] think] [that] _that's_ viable . Um [as] _long as it's_ [your] [flag] [and] [and] you've made [your] [your] point . [I think] . [Yeah] Because , realistically , [like] [for] [you] [for] [you [you] don't] [think] [it's] [right] 
B|67| B: _No ._ 
A|68| A: [And] [I] [would] never _do [it_ .] [I I] love _this country_ [too much] _, and_ [that] [symbol] means [a] lot _to me_ . 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: Um . [But I] guess [it's] [just] [one] [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] _that's_ what's something [it's] [a] need [for] them [you know] . 
B|71| B: [Well] [here] again [we] [uh] [even] [though] [you] [uh] physically [you] _agree with_ [me] [you you] wouldn't [do it] _yourself_ . 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] Yes . [No .] 
B|73| B: Nevertheless [you] maintain _that it's_ [it] [is the right] [of] [of] any citizen [to burn the] [symbol] [of] [their] [country] . 
A|74| A: Right . [Yeah .] [Uh huh .] 
B|75| B: [Uh [,] um] [so] [long as it's] [their] possession . Ok , you're you're [that's fine] _up_ [to] [there] except _that [uh_ ,] [what] [that] [flag] symbolizes [is] [uh uh] [is] [this [country] ,] 
A|76| A: [Uh huh .] 
B|77| B: [and I] used [to] [know] [as a] Boy Scout [but] _all_ [I] remember [was] [the] red [in [the] flag] represented [the] blood [that] [was] shed [to] [to] create [this [country] [,] and] [to] maintain [it .] 
A|78| A: [Yeah .] 
B|79| B: [And] , [to me] [that's [uh] uh] black eye [to] every man [that] _ever_ [uh] carried [a] weapon [or] killed [for] his [country] . 
A|80| A: [I] [agree] [there] [too] . [I] [agree with] [you] [there] [too] . [I I] [the] [um] [I I] [it's] [I] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting [But [I] don't] [think] [that] [I don't] [think] [that uh] [we have] [a] [right] [to] stop somebody from [that] [you know] 
B|81| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [the] same [I don't] [know] [I] guess [I] get [I] get [uh] [all] mixed [up] inside . _when_ , [Yeah] 
B|83| B: [It's] _It's very_ easy [to [do] .] 
A|84| A: [it] _when_ [it's] [uh] [it's] an emotional issue [, and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] [about] [it] logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] [say] [to yourself] [now] emotionally [this] _is a_ disgusting [thing] [, uh] [but] logically [um] [even] [you know] [for] instance , [the] pro life pro choice movement [, [uh] [you] know] [I don't] [know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [, but they] [would] vote pro choice . 
B|85| B: [Uh] [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: because [you know] That's [just] [a] disgusting [thing you know] somebody an abortion means [it's] [somebody's] [in] trouble [and] [that it's] an awful [thing] [, [you] know] 
B|87| B: [Well] [I think] [it] [should be] permitted under certain 
A|88| A: [but] [Yeah .] [but] [it] [that's uh] [that's] [what] [I mean] , see [, but] [but] realistically _when_ [you] [think] [of] [it] [it] [just] sounds [like] such an awful [thing] [, and] [it] evokes an emotional response . [I think] [that's] [the] hardest [thing] [, [I] don't] [know] [if] [I] could [ever] [be] [a] judge , because some things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|89| B: [Uh-huh .] Huh [. Well] [tell] [me] [has] [it] [ever] been decided [when] [when] [is a] [uh] fetus [a] human ? 
A|90| A: [No] , no [I think] [the] [um] sometimes [I] guess [what] [did] [I] read recently [the] [um] [the] [uh] Christian [uh] point [is] [is] always [the] point [of] [well] [it's] at conception [but] [then] [um] [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception [is a] biblical term . [And] there's no concept [of] conception [in] medicine [or] biology . 
B|91| B: Huh . 
A|92| A: [so] [then] [that] [so] [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then .] So [it's] [I don't] [know] [. [It's] very] [it's] [it's] [uh [you] know] [It's] [a] [it's] [a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] really something how [um] political ideas [and] viewpoints _within_ [one] [country] _can vary_ [so] [much] [and] [also] _within_ [um] _within_ [a ,] 
B|93| B: Or [they] [on] [their] [within] [the] [own] [uh] society [, it] [can vary] . 
A|94| A: [Yeah] [and] how [Yeah] how it'll sway from [one] [one] extreme [to] another . 
B|95| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [Uh] [I think] [that [uh] [you] know] [I I] [just] read something [I think in] TIME magazine [uh] [about] [um] protest
