A|0| A: _Okay _,_ uh ,_ _what_ kind _of_ hobbies _do you_ _have_ Lori ? 
B|1| B: _Uh _,_ I guess_ _, I_ _, uh , _I_ like_ _to _play_ golf_ . 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _And _,_ uh , I_ also _like_ _to_ _plant_ _flowers_ _and_ [do] [do] _some_ gardening _and_ [do] arts _and_ crafts . 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ Where _do you_ [play golf] _in_ _this_ _area_ ? 
B|5| B: _Well _,_ we_ _live , uh ,_ pretty _close_ , _to the_ Mesquite _Golf Course ._ 
A|6| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: _So _,_ we_ _will_ [play] either _out_ _there_ _or_ _at_ _Firewheel_ . _That is_ usually where _we_ [play] _, but _I_ have_ _played_ _you know_ different courses [in] _in the_ Dallas [area] . 
A|8| A: Do [you] [, uh _,] do you_ _ride_ [or] _do you_ _pull_ _a cart_ _when_ [you] [play golf] ? 
B|9| B: _Uh ,_ both 
A|10| A: _Oh_ . 
B|11| B: Not _at the_ same _time ._ 
A|12| A: [I] _was_ _going to_ say , _that_ could _be_ difficult 
B|13| B: No , sometimes _we_ [ride] _and_ sometimes [, uh _,] we_ , [pull] _, we_ _like_ [to] , [to] _, uh , a_ lot [of] _the_ times _just_ walk [, uh ,] _for_ _the_ exercise . _But_ 
A|14| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [I] find [that] _when I_ [ride] _in [a_ cart] _, I_ [play] better _and_ _I think_ _it is_ _cause_ _I don't_ _get_ _as_ tired 
A|16| A: [I think] [that] might _be_ true . 
B|17| B: Yeah . 
A|18| A: [I don't] [like] pulling [a cart] _on_ Firewell [golf] _course_ _because_ _they_ want [you] [to] [pull] [the] [cart] _on the_ path . 
B|19| B: [I] _know _,_ _and_ that_ makes me _so_ mad You _know ,_ _it is_ [like] _it is_ _not_ [going to] [do] [that] _much_ damage _to _the_ course , but_ apparently [they] [think] differently 
A|20| A: [That is] _the reason_ [, [I] don't] _play over there_ . 
B|21| B: Yeah . 
A|22| A: [I like] [the course [, but] [I] don't] _play over there_ _because_ _, you_ _, they_ [don't] _, uh , you know_ [don't] allow [you] [to] [pull] [a cart] . 
B|23| B: _Right_ . 
A|24| A: [And [,] [I] don't] [think] [a cart] damages [the] turf . 
B|25| B: _Right_ . _Well ,_ [the reason] why _we_ [play over there] [is] [because] its where , since _we_ _are_ [a] _Garland_ resident [, they] gave us _a special_ deal where [you] can _get_ [, uh ,] ten rounds [of] [golf] _for_ [a] hundred dollars , yeah _, a_ hundred dollars _cause_ _it is_ half price [what] [the] normal green fees _are_ . 
A|26| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _So_ _that is_ why _we_ [you know] [play over there] _cause_ _we have_ got our _card_ 
A|28| A: [Well [,] I guess] [I] could use [a] [card] _too_ _. I_ [live , uh ,] very near [, uh ,] very [close] [to the] [Firewheel] [Golf Course .] 
B|29| B: [Oh] [, do you] ? _So you_ _live in_ _Garland_ _then_ . 
A|30| A: Yes [, I] [live in] northwest [Garland] _. Right_ _up_ [there] near [the] [golf] [course] . 
B|31| B: [Okay ,] well _we_ _are_ [in] south [Garland] [, but] yeah , next _time_ [you] _go_ _, uh , you know ,_ check into _it [,_ _they] _have_ , uh ,_ _it is_ _just_ [like] _, uh , a_ bus [card] _and_ [they] _just_ punch _it_ . You _know ,_ _it_ has got _one_ _through_ ten [on] _it_ _and_ every _time_ [you] _go_ [they] _just_ punch _it_ _for_ [you] . 
A|32| A: [Well ,] [in the] _last_ two years _, I have_ [not] [played] very [much] [golf] [because] [I] am involved [in] Boy Scouts . 
B|33| B: [Oh] , okay . 
A|34| A: [So _,] I [have_ [, uh _,] I] [have_ [, uh _,] I] have_ children Boy Scout age . 
B|35| B: You must [have] [a] _, a_ son . 
A|36| A: [I have] two boys [that] [are] boy scout age [, and] [, uh ,] [so] [I] am very active [in] Boy Scouts 
B|37| B: [Oh] , okay . 
A|38| A: [so] [I] would [have] [to] say [that] camping [and] hiking [and] canoeing [and] Boy Scouts [is] my hobby . 
B|39| B: Yeah . 
A|40| A: [But] [I] 
B|41| B: [Oh] well [that] sounds [like] _fun_ [too] 
A|42| A: [but] my [golf] clubs [will] _probably_ rust _before_ [I] [get] [to] use _them_ again [because] my boys [are] still right [at the] beginning age _and [it_ is] _probably_ [going _to] be_ six [to] eight years _before_ [they] [go] [to] college . 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] [Well [,] you] need [to] [, uh ,] teach [them] how _to play_ [and] take [them] _out_ [on [the] course] _with_ [you] 
A|44| A: That's right . Lessons [are] expensive though . 
B|45| B: [Oh] , yeah . [Well] [you] can teach [them] 
A|46| A: [Well [,] they] would _probably_ never _make it_ [then] [because] [I don't] [think] [, uh , I] only took lessons [for] [golf] [when I] _was_ [in] college . 
B|47| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [Uh ,] [as] [a] [course] [for] P E [you know] [so] [I] could graduate . 
B|49| B: [Right] , [Right] . [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [But] [, uh ,] [that is] [the] only [time] [I think] [I have] ever _really_ taken [golf] lessons [and that] _was_ kind [of] [a] group scenario [and] [not] individual . 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh [.] Right] [. Right] . 
A|52| A: [I] took [one] lesson [one] other [time .] Besides [that] [, uh , _I] _just_ [,_ uh ,] _try to_ _make_ [the] club hit [the] ball . 
B|53| B: [Right] . Yeah [, I] [know] [what] [you] mean 
A|54| A: [I don't] want [to play] strike [out] [, you know] . 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [But] [I have] [fun] doing [it ,] [some] [, uh , you know _,] I have_ [some] _good_ shots [and] [some] bad shots . 
B|57| B: [Oh] yeah . It , [it is] [just] nice [to] [get] outdoors [and] [do] something . 
A|58| A: [So you] said [you] work [, uh ,] [in the] _gardens_ [too] . Do [you] [have [, uh ,] [a] special] [flowers] ? 
B|59| B: [Well] flower [gardens] [. [I] like] [to] [have ,] matter [of] fact [this] past weekend [I just] got finished planting _a bunch of_ tulips [and] daffodil bulbs . [So ,] those ought [to be] coming [up] around spring [time] 
A|60| A: My wife _had , uh ,_ [just] _put_ [in [a] bunch of] [, I] want [to] say _, they are_ _pansies_ . 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: She _put them_ [in] [like] two months ago _cause _they_ are_ _winter_ plants . 
B|63| B: [Right] . 
A|64| A: _And [they_ have] been [, we] thought _even_ [with] all [the] cold _weather_ _weather_ [we have] _had_ [they have] been blooming [just] fine . 
B|65| B: [Oh] [, they] [do] great [. I] [put] mine [in] [probably] [in] November . 
A|66| A: [That is] [when] she did _, I think_ . 
B|67| B: Yeah [, I think] [it] [was] November [and] [I don't] [do] anything [to] mine , water [them] [or] anything [And they] [just [,] they] [do] [really] [good] [and] [I] [even] [had [, uh [,] I] guess] [it] [was] [last] year [or] [the] year [before] [, I] [had] [some] [out] [and it] froze [and] [the] [pansies] looked terrible [, but] [they] came back later [. I] didn't [do] anything [to] [them] [so] [they are] [, uh [,] they are] [good] [to] _plant_ _in the winter [time_ .] They [last] [for] [a] long [time] [then] . [So ,] _if you_ start putting [them] [, you know [,] you] can [put them] [out] [in the] spring [too] [, but] once [it] starts getting real hot [then] [it] [just] kills [them] [cause they] can't stand [the] hot [weather] . 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] Do [they] survive longer [if you] [plant] [them] [in the winter time] ? Will _they _make it through_ the summer_ sun ? 
B|69| B: No [, they] won't [make it through the summer] [because] [it] gets [too] hot [, but] [they make it through] [probably] [winter] [and] spring . [So ,] 
A|70| A: [Well] . 
B|71| B: Yeah [, I have] got [some] [of] those [too] , [cause] [I] love [flowers] 
A|72| A: [Well ,] [that is] [good] . 
B|73| B: Yeah . [And] [I] [do] [, I] [try to] [do] [some] arts [and] crafts [and] [I] love [to] [go] ,
