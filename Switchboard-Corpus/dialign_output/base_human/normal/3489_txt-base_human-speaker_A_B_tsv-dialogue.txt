A|0| A: Okay , Jerry _, I_ guess tonight's topic _is_ _about_ _recycling_ . 
B|1| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _And_ _I'd_ _like_ _to_ tell _you_ first _of_ _all_ _what's_ happening _in_ _our_ _community_ here _in_ Plano . 
B|3| B: _All right ._ 
A|4| A: Right _now_ _we_ _have_ _a_ pretty nice _recycling_ program where _a_ lot _of the_ _recyclable materials_ can _be_ picked _up_ by _the ,_ by _the_ collection agency _or_ _the , the_ _city_ along _with_ _your_ garbage can . Uh _, you_ can _put_ _out_ newspaper _, you_ can _put_ _out_ glass _, you_ can _put_ _out_ aluminum cans _, you_ can _put_ , _put_ _out_ certain types _of plastic_ material _and_ _that_ _is_ _on a_ roll _out_ effort _right now_ . Not _all_ _the_ citizens _and_ _the_ people _in_ Plano can _go_ ahead _and , uh ,_ participate _right now_ _, but _,_ uh ,_ _that_ _will be_ rolled _out_ _to_ everyone _, I_ hope _, in the_ next year _or_ _so_ . _And_ those _that_ aren't participating , _they_ _have_ _the_ specific drop _off_ sites where _you_ can _take_ glass _and_ newspaper _and_ aluminum . _And _I_ think_ _, uh ,_ overall _that's_ _an_ _, an_ excellent opportunity because _I_ hate _to_ _see_ _our_ landfills being filled _up_ _and , uh ,_ growing bigger _and_ bigger _and_ bigger where _they_ are becoming _a_ big _problem_ _for_ _not_ _only_ _the_ people _that_ are living today _, but_ _for_ _the_ future also _. So_ , 
B|5| B: Yeah [, uh [,] I] was 
A|6| A: How _about_ _your_ _community_ ? 
B|7| B: My [community] _, that's_ cute _. I_ live [in] _a place_ called _Dye Mound_ . 
A|8| A: [Dye Mound] ? 
B|9| B: Or [Dye] Community . 
A|10| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|11| B: [And] _it's_ [not] [a] [city] , [not] incorporated , my nearest neighbor's [about] [a] half [a] mile _at_ least [, I] can't even [see] their house [and , uh ,] 
A|12| A: Sounds _like_ [a place] where [I] grew _up_ 
B|13| B: Yeah [, I] mean [, uh ,] I'm [out] [in] , I'm [out] [in the] wilderness . Literally . 
A|14| A: _Well , I_ _like_ _it ._ 
B|15| B: [And] [, uh _,] well ,_ give [you] [an] _idea _,_ it's_ three [and] [a] half miles [of] dirt road [to] [the] concrete [, I] mean , [to] [the] asphalt , we're [out] there . 
A|16| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: [And] [, uh ,] [we] [, I] _do_ _some_ interesting [recycling] things . 
A|18| A: _Well ,_ good . 
B|19| B: I'm building [our] house [right now] [and] I'm going _to incorporate_ into my [, uh ,] garage area [a] weight activated [, uh ,] crusher . 
A|20| A: Oh , okay . 
B|21| B: [So] when [I] drive [the] car [in [the] [,] in the] driveway [in the] afternoon , [it] , [it] [will] just drive [it] [up] [on a] ramp [that] actually puts me [on] top [of [the] , [the] [,] uh ,] pressure side [of] [a] [, uh ,] _hydraulic_ cylinder . 
A|22| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [And] [the] weight [of the] car [will] crush , [what's] ever [in the] disposer . 
A|24| A: Oh . 
B|25| B: hopefully _, it's_ [not] my wife . 
A|26| A: _Well ,_ let's hope [not] _. You_ can _be [,_ uh ,] _get_ [in] trouble _for _that_ ._ 
B|27| B: [Well , I] _thought_ [I'd] _, you know ,_ [I'd] use [it] as [a] [, an] escapement type _thing_ _. I_ don't _know_ _if_ you're familiar [with] [that] operation [, but ,] what [you] _do_ [is] [you] just build [up] [the] pressure 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [and] _then_ [you] [go] over [and] _release it_ [and] _then_ [it] just , [it] just drops _, you know_ . 
A|30| A: [Well [,] it's] quite _similar_ [to] [a] [hydraulic] _jack ,_ isn't [it] ? 
B|31| B: Very [similar] , yeah . 
A|32| A: Okay , okay . 
B|33| B: [Well ,] what , what [it] [will [be] [,] you] just [, you] drive [up] [on] [the] [jack [,] but] [you] , [it] won't [go] down . 
A|34| A: Yes , until [you] [release _it] ._ 
B|35| B: Until [you] pull [the] pin , yeah . 
A|36| A: [All right .] 
B|37| B: Anyway [I] [have] another [, uh ,] [recycling] method [I] use . 
A|38| A: _I think_ , Yes . 
B|39| B: [You] _know_ [all] [that] _junk mail_ [you] [get] ? 
A|40| A: Oh , yes [, I] sure [do] . 
B|41| B: The glossy paper [that] says , buy _this_ _, and_ send [off] [for _that] and_ [you] [have] won [and] [all] [that .] 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [Well ,] anytime [they] send me [a] _return_ envelope [I] [put] [all] [that] stuff back [in the] envelope plus [the] other stuff [that] [I] _, you know ,_ happen [to] gather [up] . 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] Oh . 
B|45| B: Because [, uh _,] well ,_ [like] [I] say , [we] live [a] way [and] when [you] throw trash away [, you] throw [it] [in] my yard . 
A|46| A: Yes . 
B|47| B: [And I] don't [like] [that] 
A|48| A: No . 
B|49| B: [so] [I] don't [do] [that [.] So] [I] [take] [it] [and] [I] send _, and_ [I] _mail_ [it] back [to] them . 
A|50| A: [Well ,] great . That's excellent . 
B|51| B: _I've_ had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
A|52| A: [Well [,] uh ,] [if] [a] lot [of] people did [that] , [then] [we] wouldn't [have] [a] lot [of] [this] [junk mail] . That's [a] great [idea] [. I] hadn't [thought] [about] [that and] [we] might [be] able [to incorporate] [some] [of] [that .] One [thing] , 
B|53| B: Yeah . [Well , [I] think] _one_ [of [the] , the] best ways [to] eliminate [, uh ,] [or] help [the] [recycling] [problem] [is] [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
A|54| A: Right . 
B|55| B: For instance [, uh [,] I] saw [a] [thing] [on] [, uh ,] NOVA [, [I] think] [it] was [the] other day . 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: This guy has designed [recyclable materials] [, I] mean [recyclable] items . 
A|58| A: Right . 
B|59| B: Whatever he makes [, it's] [all] [out] [of the] same [thing] . 
A|60| A: Oh . 
B|61| B: See , [so] , [plastic] [, it's] [all] [out] [of plastic] . 
A|62| A: Yes . 
B|63| B: If [it's] metal [, it's] [all] [out] [of] metal . It's , he's [a] design , he's [a] engineer , designing stuff . 
A|64| A: [Well [,] that's] [a] great [idea [,] that's] [a] great [idea] . 
B|65| B: [And] _, [and_ ,] incorporating _, you know ,_ reusable [materials] into [your] _, uh , you know ,_ [your] assembly line into [your] actual scheme [of] product operations [is] [is] [the] [only] way [to] really [do] [it] [on a] , [on a] broad scale . 
A|66| A: Products . Yes . 
B|67| B: Make [it] financially [, uh ,] attractive [to] recycle 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [and] somebody [will] find [a] way [to] make money _at_ [it .] 
A|70| A: Yes , [they] [will] . 
B|71| B: [And] , 
A|72| A: Exactly . 
B|73| B: [Well ,] there [is] [a] guy [in] Dallas [, that's] [all] he does . 
A|74| A: Huh . 
B|75| B: He collects trash [. You] _know _,_ [and_ ,] 
A|76| A: [Well [,] that's] [a] full time job . 
B|77| B: Yeah _, well ,_ he's , he's [out] [for] cardboard . 
A|78| A: Yes [, well ,] [I've] found [out] , too , [that] [, uh , you know ,] [a] couple years ago , we've always been [recycling] newspaper [for] [the] last twelve years [, and] [at] [one] time [we] could [get] [a] pretty good [return] [, uh ,] [with] [the] Boy Scouts . We could [take] [and] collect [the] newspaper ,
