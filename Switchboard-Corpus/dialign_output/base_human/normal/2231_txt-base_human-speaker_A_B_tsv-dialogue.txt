A|0| A: Okay . Capital _punishment ,_ oh _, I_ honestly _don't_ _feel_ _like_ _it's_ strict _enough_ _in_ _my_ opinion . 
B|1| B: In _the_ way _that_ [it's] applied _or_ [it's] applied _at all_ ? 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh ._ Applied [at all] . 
B|3| B: So _, I ,_ how do _you_ [feel] _that_ _it_ should _be_ applied ? 
A|4| A: _Well [,_ I] [I] _just_ [feel] _like_ there's _a lot of_ murderers _and_ rapists _, and_ everything _else ,_ _just_ walking [the] streets _. You know ?_ 
B|5| B: _And_ _that_ , _that_ , [the] penalty ought _to_ _be_ _out_ _there_ [, and] _be_ enforced ? 
A|6| A: _Yes ._ _Yes ._ Not getting _paroled ,_ let's _say_ _in_ _so_ _many_ , _years_ . 
B|7| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| A: _I mean _,_ if_ _your_ _going to_ _sentence_ _somebody_ , let's _say_ twenty _years ,_ _let them_ stay twenty _years_ . 
B|9| B: _That's [,_ I] agree with _that_ completely _. _I_ know_ we [don't] have [enough] prisons _, but_ _there_ _has_ got [to] _be_ _some_ kind [of] [punishment ,] For these _people_ . 
A|10| A: There [has] _, that's_ _right_ . 
B|11| B: Because [if] _they_ turn around _, they_ _can_ _get_ away _, they_ _get_ away with _it [,_ and] _they_ _get_ away with _it [,_ and] _they_ _get_ away with _it [,_ and] then _they_ do something worse 
A|12| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: [and] _they_ _get_ [a] slap _on the_ wrist . They _get ,_ thirty days [in] jail 
A|14| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|15| B: [and] _they_ final _get_ _up_ [to] where _they_ kill [somebody] [else [,] and] _they go_ through fourteen appeals [, and] how [many] hundreds [of] thousands [of] taxpayer dollars . 
A|16| A: _Uh-huh ._ [That's] _right_ . [That's ,] honestly _right_ . 
B|17| B: _And_ _it's ,_ [Well _,] they_ certainly _are_ living off our [at] our expense . 
A|18| A: Uh [, they] sure [are] _just_ _because_ _, some_ _innocent_ person , [can] _really_ , 
B|19| B: [I] _didn't_ , 
A|20| A: [it] _seems like_ , _really_ [a] rough _time_

A|22| A: _you _know_ ?_ I'm _not_ _saying_ _innocent_ person , let's _say_ _someone_ wrote [a] hot check _, for_ instance _. You _know_ _,_ it_ _seems like_ _when [they_ go] [to] _prison _,_ [it_ [,] they] _really_ _seem_ _like_ _it's a_ rough _time_ _for_ _them_ 
B|23| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _he's_ _just_ [there] [to] serve _his_ _time , and_ [get] _back out_ [on the] street . 
B|25| B: _And_ [, and] _be_ [paroled [,] and] [and] have served [the] [sentence] , 
A|26| A: [Yeah .] 
B|27| B: [that's] _what_ [, that's] _what_ _people_ face with _that_ choice . One _thing_ [I] [really] hate , _is_ [they] [don't] explain [to] [the] jurors , _in a_ , _in a_ trial , _in a_ _capital_ murder trial , _or_ [in] cases [of] rape , _or_ [in] different _things_ _that_ [are] [so] horrible , _what_ [it] means [when they] [sentence] [them] [to] _, you know ,_ they'll [sentence] [them] [to] ninety [years] [and] [say] _that_ _it's _,_ you know ,_ _that_ [it's] [going to] _, you know ,_ 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: _that_ should _be_ life _, but_ , instead , [in] , [in] given [the] choice [of] _either_ sentencing [to] death , _or_ sentencing [to] life , they'll give [them] ninety [years] [in] [prison] _or_ something [, and] then turn around [in] thirty [years ,] _that_ _, you know [,_ and] _less_ they're [out] . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: Even [if] [, if] they're _even_ [in] _that_ long . _Or_ [they] appeal [, and] then [they] [get] an appeal _that_ says [it] _was _,_ you know ,_ an unjust amount _of [time_ ,] an extraordinary long length , _or_ something . 
A|32| A: Time , uh-huh . _Yes [._ _I] [was_ _,] I would_ _just_ _be _,_ I would_ love _to _see_ them_ _just_ [really] [get] real strict [on] _parole_ [you know] . 
B|33| B: [Yeah .] I'd [like] [to see] [the] death penalty _more_ _as_ [a] deterrent [, I] _think_ _people_ [know] _that_ nobody , _that_ [it] _doesn't_ _, you know ,_ [it's] [not] [a] deterrent [right] _now_ _, because_ [it's] [not] [really] effective . 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: There's should [be _,] you know ,_ this [, for] this crime , this _is_ [the] penalty [. You] killed , [someone] _you know ,_ [in] _cold_ blood _or_ whatever . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [.] You] [get _,] it_ _back_ _, yeah ._ 
B|37| B: This _is_ what's [going to] happen . 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: _And_ [, [I] mean [,] it] sounds horrible _. It_ [, I] hear myself [saying] this [, and] _, but_ _, I ,_ _don't know what_ [else] [to] do with [some] [of] these _people_ , _that_ [are] , 
A|40| A: [Yeah _.] But_ [it's _,] I _, I_ know_ . 
B|41| B: [because] [they] [let them] [back out] again [, and] [they] do [the] same _thing_ over [, and] over , again , 
A|42| A: Same [thing] , _Yes ._ 
B|43| B: then [they] put [them] [back] [in] jail [, and] [they] [get] [out] [, and] [and] _more_ [and] _more_ [innocent] _people_ [are] hurt _or_ killed 
A|44| A: _Yes ._ [Uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and] these guys [just] [are] [on the] endless merry-go-round _in the_ legal system . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _And_ [it's] _like I_ _said_ [at] our expense . 
A|48| A: Uh _, _a_ lot of_ [people] [really] [doesn't] [think] [that] much _about [it_ [,] because] [it] hasn't happened [to] _them ,_ which [it] hasn't [to] me [either] [, you _know] ?_ 
B|49| B: [Yes .] 
A|50| A: Thank goodness _. But_ _still_ [, it] _could_ . 
B|51| B: [I _know] , I [,_ _you] read_ [about it] _in _the_ paper ,_ every day , [somebody] who's done this , _or_ [that] , something [really] horrible 
A|52| A: [Yes .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and] [they] [just] [get] away with [it [,] and] nothing happens . 
A|54| A: [And] [as] far [as] [the] _other_ _states_ [, I] honestly [don't know what] their [capital] [punishment] [is] _. You _know_ , I [, I_ ,] haven't kept [up] [, you know ,] _anything_ _, like_ [that] . 
B|55| B: [Yeah [.] I] [think] [I] [think] Texas [is] Texas , [the] southern [states] [seem] [to] [be] somewhat _more_ conservative [and] [still] have [the] death penalty [, and] [I] _think [,_ I know] California had [it] [for] [a] long [time , and] then [they] _, uh ,_ took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [and] [people] [like] Charles Manson [, and] [, and] [some] [of] these [other] [people] , who were sentenced [to] death [at] [the] [time] [they] repealed [the] death penalty , were sentenced [to] life [in] [prison [,] and] [are] _now_ , _now_ [that] _even_ _though_ California [has] reinstated [the] death penalty [, for] whatever various crimes _. The_ [people] who were [there] originally , [when they] , [when they] _changed_ [the] laws [to] revoke [the] death penalty , [are] [still] [in] [there] [for] , [are] [in] [prison ,] [in] quote [, for] life [, and] [, and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] [parole] [, some] [of] [them [,] like] Manson who's come [up] [you know] 
A|58| A: Uh . [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [it's] been denied fortunately _but_ , 
A|60| A: [Yes _.] But_ [still] [, it] came [up] [though] , [didn't] [it ,] 
B|61| B: [Yeah .] 
A|62| A: [I mean [,] you know] 
B|63| B: [Well ,] [the] jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him [to] death 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] [his] thousandth [and] one appeal , [the] state [of] California revoked [the] law _in the_ early seventies [, and] then [they] reinstated [it] later _, but_ [the] penalty [didn't] [go] [back] [. You know ?] 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: _It_ [seems like] [a lot of] times [the] law [is] , [is] totally [on the] criminal side [, and] [, and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
A|68| A: [Yes [.] The] victim [is] [really] , [seems like] left [out] [in the] [cold] , [more] [or] [less] , [doesn't] [it ,] 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [in [a] lot of] _, well ,_ especially [in] [things] [, you] pick [up] [the paper [,] and] [you read] [, you know [,] you] [think ,] oh _my_ goodness 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] [And] [the] , [the] laws [are] [all] , [the] rules . Some [of] [the] [things] [that] [would] _make sense_ [to] , [to] tell [the] jury , [that] this , this guy [has] [a] [, a] prior criminal history [, you know ,] where [he's] raped ten women 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] this one trial [, and] [they] [don't] finds [anything] [out] [about] [the] facts [that] [he's] done this over [and] over [and] over again 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [so] [they] [say] [, well ,] this [is] [, you [know ,] I , I] [don't know] [if] [they] [say] [it's] [the] first [time] offense [or] whatever _, but_ [they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] , thinking [he's] [not] [a] habitual criminal . 
A|76| A: [Or] [, you know ,] _plead insanity_ . 
B|77| B: [Yeah] [, yeah _.] Well ,_ To [some] extent [if] [they] [would] do something with [some] [of] those [people] [. But] [that] [seems] [to] [be] [a] good way [to] [get] off [for] [a lot of] [them] too . 
A|78| A: Oh yes , 
B|79| B: They [plead insanity] 
A|80| A: uh-huh . [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [and] then three [years] later they're cured [, and] [let] loose [on] society again . 
A|82| A: [Yes [.] [I] [,] it] [just] , [just] [doesn't] [make sense] , 
B|83| B: [I mean ,] [it's a] [it's a] scary world [out] [there] anymore , where [your] afraid [to] [go] [out] , 
A|84| A: [I ,] 
B|85| B: [I [know] ,] [in] , [in the] Dallas metroplex area [, I] [don't] [go] [out] hardly [if] [I] [don't] have [to] [at] night by myself 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [and] [I , I] certainly [, I , I] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] Texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way _when I was_ younger . 
A|88| A: [Uh-huh [.] Well [,] [like] [I] ,] [said] [, I] live [in a] small place [. You know] . 
B|89| B: We [could] [go] around [, and] , boy [and] , 
A|90| A: [But] [, uh ,] [even] [the] small towns [now] [though] , [has] [really] [changed] from _when I was a kid [,_ but] [now] I'm raising children [. It] [it] [really] [is] . 
B|91| B: [Yes .] Ever [, you] can't [even] , [when I was a kid [,] I would] _run_ between [my] neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and] , [as] long [as] [my] mom had [a] general idea where [I was] [and] [I was] [back] [on the] [time ,] 
A|92| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [and] [now] [I] [don't] [let] [my] kids _out of_ [the] front yard , [that] [I] can't [see _them] ._ 
A|94| A: See [them .] [Yeah .] [Yeah [.] It] [really] [is] [. Well ,] we're probably fixing [to] [run] [out [of] time] pretty , soon , 
B|95| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [but] I've enjoyed _talking to you_ . 
B|97| B: [Well ,] good [talking to you] too . _Bye_ , 
A|98| A: [Bye] 
B|99| B: bye .
