A|0| A: We're _to_ discuss _a little bit_ _about_ _the_ process _of_ putting _someone_ _in a_ nursing _home and_ making _the_ decision _on_ _a_ _family_ basis _and ,_ probably _the_ _first_ question would _be_ _whether_ you've _ever_ _had_ _to_ _go_ through _that_ process . 
B|1| B: _Well ,_ _not_ _so much_ personally _but_ _my_ , um , husband _has_ an aunt who _has_ _been_ _like_ [a] second _mother_ _, I_ mean _always_ lived _in the_ same town [and] took _care_ [of] him [and] such . _They_ _live_ _down _in_ College Station_ _where ,_ his parents _do_ too _. And_ _they_ put _her_ [in a] [home] last year . 
A|2| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _She_ appeared [to] _have_ [a] couple [of] light strokes [and] started _to ,_ uh , _not_ [be] _able _to_ be_ [in] _her_ apartment [on] _her_ own . 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _So_ _they_ found [a] , [a] place nearby [that] _they_ put _her_ [in] last year . 
A|6| A: [So] _it_ _was_ _pretty much_ [a] physical decision ? 
B|7| B: Uh , _yeah_ , although _she_ _is_ , uh _, in_ [pretty] good _health_ [and] she's , doesn't _take_ any medication _, it's just_ _she_ [had] [had] _her_ own apartment [and] drove [a] car [and] everything up until _that point_ . 
A|8| A: _Um ._ 
B|9| B: Then _she was_ starting [to] get , uh , _you _know_ ,_ lose memory _sometimes_ [and _,] which is_ _kind of_ _frightening_ _when_ she's _in the_ car . 
A|10| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|11| B: Uh , 
A|12| A: My husband's _family_ _are_ reaching [that point] _but _it's_ , it's so_ difficult . Was [she] [in] favor _of it_ _or_ , _or_ [was] [she] [kind of] opposed _to it_ ? 
B|13| B: _Well ,_ _yeah_ , _when_ [it] finally came _down_ [to _it] ,_ um _, she_ _just_ got _to the_ [point] after _the _,_ I_ mean _, it_ _wasn't a_ _very_ , um , strong stroke . _It_ [was] _just_ [kind of] _all of a sudden_ [she] _wasn't_ _herself_ anymore . 
A|14| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: _And_ [she] got [kind of] fearful [of] _being_ [on] _her_ own _. She_ _never_ _really_ ate _very_ _well_ . _It_ [was] one thing _. She_ hardly [ever] took _care_ [of] _herself_ 
A|16| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [and] [she] _didn't_ eat _. She_ ate _very_ poor [so] _I think_ _she was_ , _you _know_ ,_ _bad_ , uh , nutrition [on] top [of it] _. And ,_ uh _, she_ got _to the_ [point] [she] _didn't want to_ alone anymore _. _So_ ,_ 
A|18| A: [So] often [I think] though , elderly _people_ _don't_ realize [that] _their_ diet [is] [that] [bad] . [I] work _with_ [a] lot [of] elderly _people_ , I'm [a] trust officer 
B|19| B: [Um .] 
A|20| A: _and so_ often [they] [think] _they're_ adequately caring _for_ themselves [when] _they're really_ [not] eating [very] [much] _or_ [very] balanced _meals ._ 
B|21| B: _Well , _she_ was_ almost ridiculous . Like she'd eat ice cream [and] cookies . She'd , 
A|22| A: Yes . [Well] [you know] _that's_ part _of the_ aging process , That _your_ taste buds goes back [to the] sweet taste . 
B|23| B: Didn't one , 
A|24| A: [It] [really] [is] . 
B|25| B: _Oh_ [really] ? 
A|26| A: _Yeah ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: [Well] [she] _didn't want to_ cook [for] _herself_ anymore . 
A|28| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|29| B: _Oh_ _, that's_ too [much] trouble _. That's_ too [much] trouble . Didn't _want to_ cook . 
A|30| A: [And] [the] portions _, people_ _don't want to_ try [to] figure _out_ _little_ bitty individual _meals ._ [I] [do] [that] right now , 
B|31| B: [Yeah .] 
A|32| A: [and] I'm [not] near nursing [home] age . 
B|33| B: Although _they've_ got , uh , Meals On Wheels , Which [I] understand [is] [a] [really] good , [you _know] ,_ _way_ [to] handle [that] [so] [that] at least [they] eat . 
A|34| A: [Yeah .] _Uh-huh [._ So] _as a_ _family_ [you] [all] [just] visited nursing homes _or_ probably [in College Station] _there_ [wasn't a] _whole_ lot [of] choice . 
B|35| B: No _, I_ [don't] [think] [there] [was] . [Um] _, I_ [know] [a little bit] more _from_ [a] , [a] co-worker . Her mother-in-law [had] _been in_ [for] quite _some_ time [and] [had] _different_ degrees _of a_ place [that] _she _was_ _in_ ._ 
A|36| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|37| B: [Um] _, _she_ was_ ambulatory [and so] [there] [was] [a] lesser _care_ . Uh , _then_ [she] got , uh , uh , hip broken [and] _then_ , uh _, she_ [wasn't] [as] ambulatory [so] [they] were almost , [you _know] _,_ [to_ the] [point] [of] saying [she] _can't_ [be] here anymore . 
A|38| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: But _, I_ remember _from her_ checking around _, she_ ended up staying at [the] Arkansas House [I think] [out] [in] Arlington , _something_ _like_ [that] . 
A|40| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|41| B: _And ,_ uh , [you know] [the] type [of] facilities [whether] [it's] [a] shared room [or] two separate rooms [that] share uh , [a] , uh , bathroom . All [of] them [all] seem [to] _say_ [that] [people] [there] [are] _going to_ steal [their] items 
A|42| A: [Oh] [yeah] [. That's] [a] given . 
B|43| B: _They're_ _always_ saying [that] somebody's _going _to_ _,_ _and_ some of_ them _, I think_ unconsciously [do] _it ,_ [you _know] _,_ [as_ a] _just ,_ [you _know] ,_ half 
A|44| A: _Uh-huh [._ And] [sometimes] [the ,] [the] help [there] _does_ [it [,] I think] . 
B|45| B: Uh _So _,_ they_ _, they_ , uh , [don't] _have_ too _many_ facilities [it] _seems_ [for] [their] personal items . Very limited space waste 
A|46| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|47| B: [but] , um , at least [they] [all] seem [to] _have_ , uh , [you _know] [,_ people] [that] monitor [their] , uh , medication intake [and] dining facilities , [you _know] ,_ [go] [to the] dining room _and , and_ eat _some_ good [meals .] 
A|48| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|49| B: [I] [know] [when] _my_ friend's mother-in-law [first] went _in [,_ I] mean , [very] antisocial . Maybe [it] takes [a] _while_ [for] them [to] _say ,_ _okay_ _, well_ I'll [be] [with] other [people] [but] , 
A|50| A: Adapt . 
B|51| B: [Yeah] [, I] [don't] understand [that] _, they_ _, they_ [don't _want to] be_ [with] anybody else . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] _I [,_ as] [I think] [I] mentioned [, I] [was [in] the] trust business [and] I've seen [so] [many] elderly _people ._ Usually [there] [has] [to be] [some] wealth involved [, which is] great , if , if you're financially , if , if [you] [don't] make [the] decisions [so] late [that] you're worried _about_ money [but] [the ,] [the] places [like] Presbyterian Village [and some _of] [the_ ,] [the] retirement places [where ,] [where] [they] [have] [different] levels [of] [care] [seems] [to be] [so much] better [, as] far [as] elderly [people] adapting . 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [They're] [able _to] move_ [in] [while] _they're_ still independent [and] still social 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and , and] [they] [do] group things [. And] [then] if [health] [or] , [or] mental capacity deteriorates , _they're_ [able to] [take] [the] next steps without [so much] change [and] oh [, I] wish everybody _could_ [go] [that] direction rather than [just] [all of a sudden] moving _out of the_ [home] [they've] [always] [been [in] .] _It's_ [really] [kind of] difficult . 
B|57| B: [Yeah] [, I] [have] [a] , um , _my_ aunt's _mother_ [is] , uh , gotten ill recently [and ,] uh _, she_ lives [in] Pennsylvania _, they_ _live_ [in] Alabama [. And] [they're] saying , hey , _we_ need [you] [to be] closer [and] [you] [have] , women [like] [that] , 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: [I] [don't] [to] men _, it_ [seems] [like] [the] women [out] [just] [out] _live_ [their] husbands _, but_ , [very] reluctantly , [that] [whole] [, I] mean 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [they] [don't] get [out of the] house _, they_ [don't] socialize [but it's] _my_ [home and] [I] [don't want to] leave [it] . 
A|62| A: [Well] _and it's_ [the] [first] step [in [,] in] actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing [and , and] aging . 
B|63| B: Uh . 
A|64| A: You [know] once [you] make [that] step [you know] [that] [it's just] [going [to] be] downhill [from] [then] [on] [and , and] I've seen [people] [really] fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to] make [the] change . 
B|65| B: [Um .] 
A|66| A: [They] [, they] became [, in] fact [, that's] probably what's [going to] happen [with] [my] husband's [mother] . She's [going to] endanger [herself] before she'll willingly [and] probably will [never] willingly make [the] decision [. And] [that] scares _me_ [the ,] [the] _thought_ [of] forcing somebody [to] [do] [something] . 
B|67| B: But [it's , it's so] lonely , [you know] [they] _can't_ get [out] [and] _see_ anyone [and] [I] mean [, it's] hard [for] , [for] [someone] [like] [me] [to] understand [that] 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: _because_ [I] [I think] , what [do] [you] [have] [there] ? [It's] [a] house , 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [it's] walls [and it's] furniture [but] there's nobody _there ._ 
A|72| A: Not [as] _independence ._ 
B|73| B: Don't [you] _want to be_ close [to] [me] ? [I] mean , [you know] [be] [with] other [people .] 
A|74| A: [Yeah .] 
B|75| B: [I] [just] [don't] understand why [they] , [so much] [want to] [just] stay [in] [that] building . 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [And] there's no [family] [there] [, they] [don't] get [to] _see_ [their] grandkids [, they] [don't] get [to] _see_ [their] children [, they] [just] [there] [in] [that] house . 
A|78| A: [Yeah [.] And] [the] quality [of] life [really] isn't [there .] 
B|79| B: [Yeah .] 
A|80| A: [Oh] [it's] tough [, it] [really] [is] . 
B|81| B: [That's] [from] [the] child's standpoint . The child [is] [going] , why [don't] [you] _want to be_ close [to] [me] [and] [your] other [family] . 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: What [does] [that] house got attraction ? 
A|84| A: [Well [,] they] fear [being] dependent [on] somebody . 
B|85| B: [I] [know] [they're really] proud [of] [independence .] 
A|86| A: [They] [, they] fear [being] [a] burden [to [,] to] [family] members . 
B|87| B: Uh . 
A|88| A: My husband's [mother] will [have] major surgery [and] _we'll_ find [out] _about_ [it] [in a] casual conversation . She'll let [something] slip [and] _we'll_ [say ,] wait [a] minute [. And [,] and] [that's] [it [,] she] , [just [,] well] [I] [didn't want to] bother [you] [. She] [can't] accept [that] [we] [want to be] [the] [care] givers . 
B|89| B: [Well ,] [when] [she] got [home] , who took [care] [of] _her_ ? 
A|90| A: [Yeah .] [Well , she] stayed [, she] stayed [in a] temporary nursing [home] . Until [she was] [okay] . 
B|91| B: [Oh] . 
A|92| A: You [know [,] it's [just] [,] [but] it's] [frightening] [to] us [because] [we] [live] [pretty] far [from her] . She's [down in] Temple 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [and] [we] [can't] [see] [her] often enough [to] [really] [know] what's [going] [on] . 
B|95| B: [Um] 
A|96| A: [So [,] it's] difficult [, it] [really] [is] [and] we're [all] heading [that] [way] [and ,] 
B|97| B: [Yeah] , [my] , husband [and] [I ,] [we] [have] [been] thinking [about] his folks [are] [in College Station] [and] we've [pretty much] planned [that] [we'll] [be] here [in the] Dallas area [and] there's nothing [to] hold them [there] [in College Station] since [they're] retired . 
A|98| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|99| B: [So] [we] [thought] maybe [we] [could] get them [to move] [a little] closer here . 
A|100| A: [Yeah]
