B|0| B: _Okay ._ 
A|1| A: [Okay] , where _have_ _you_ _all_ _been_ on vacation recently ? 
B|2| B: Recently , _my_ _most_ recent trip _was_ _last_ _year_ _, and that was_ _Detroit_ . 
A|3| A: [Detroit] ? 
B|4| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: Is [that] _a nice_ vacation _spot_ ? 
B|6| B: _Well _,_ _it_ wasn't_ _really_ _. _It was_ _,_ um _,_ uh _,_ _to_ see_ an old relative . 
A|7| A: Right _, okay_ . 
B|8| B: _And_ _it was _,_ uh ,_ _just_ _to _,_ uh ,_ [have] _some_ fellowship _with_ her . 
A|9| A: Right . _So_ _you_ _probably_ wouldn't recommend [that] as _a_ big _tourist spot_ ? 
B|10| B: No . The _only_ _thing_ [that] _I , I_ visited [that] _, you know ,_ _is_ quite [a] [tourist spot] _is_ Cancun , _Mexico_ . 
A|11| A: Ooh _, that_ would be _nice ._ 
B|12| B: _And that was_ _real_ [nice .] Uh , 
A|13| A: Did [you] scuba dive _there_ ? 
B|14| B: No _, we_ _just kind of_ walked _the_ beaches _and_ looked _at_ _all the_ beautiful scenery _there ._ 
A|15| A: Ooh _, that_ would be [nice .] 
B|16| B: _Yeah _,_ and_ _just kind of_ relaxed _and_ unwound _a little bit ,_ _from_ our daily routine . 
A|17| A: _Oh _,_ that_ would be enjoyable . Right , yeah _, that's_ , _a nice_ break . 
B|18| B: Huh . 
A|19| A: [I] haven't _been_ on vacation _in_ [a] while either . Um , usually _when we_ _go_ [, we] _go_ [to] _Colorado [,_ to] Estes Park area . Which [is] _up_ [kind of] near Denver . _And , uh ,_ stay _in_ [the] mountains _up_ [there] , _do_ [a little] hiking [and] resting , _get away from_ [the] Texas heat _, that_ [kind of] _thing ._ 
B|20| B: _Uh-huh ._ Yes . [Oh [,] that's] always refreshing _to [get_ away from] . 
A|21| A: _So_ _it's_ _a lot of_ fun _. I_ worked _up_ [there] [last] summer _, so_ _I guess_ [it was] [kind of] like [a] vacation _the ,_ _whole_ summer long 
B|22| B: [Oh ,] well [, that's] [nice .] _Yeah ._ 
A|23| A: Worked [at] [a] camp [there] [, and] _so_ [I] got [to] spend _a lot of_ _time_ _up_ _in_ [the] mountains . _So_ [that's] _probably_ [my] favorite _place_ _when_ [I] [have] [to] _go_ somewhere on [a] vacation . 
B|24| B: _Well ,_ [my] [, uh ,] [my] middle daughter [and] her husband [have] _just_ taken [up] [a] new activity [, _and] that's_ canoeing . 
A|25| A: [Oh] . 
B|26| B: [And , uh ,] they've _been to_ [the] Guadalupe _River_ [, _and] they_ also [, uh [,] uh ,] [have] _been _to_ [,_ uh _,] [I_ guess] [Colorado [,] and] they've _really enjoyed_ [it] . 
A|27| A: _That's_ [nice .] We [, um [,] we] canoed [up] _in_ Arkansas [at] [the] Buffalo [River] . 
B|28| B: _It's_ _a whole_ new , _Uh-huh ._ 
A|29| A: [And] [that's] [the] best _place_ [that] I've ever canoed . 
B|30| B: Huh . 
A|31| A: [It's] [really] , [really] pretty _. I_ [was] [a little] kid then [, and] [we] [to] [have] [, uh [,] we] stayed [at] [some] park [and they] _had [a_ little] [uh ,] mountain man who came down [the] river every night [, and] he would give [a little] talk _about_ mountain things . _You_ [know _,] I think_ he [wasn't] [a] [real] mountain man _, but_ [we] were pretty convinced he [was] [a] full , hermit who _lived_ [up] _in_ _, the_ woods _, that_ he'd come _in_ his [little] log boat down [the] river , 
B|32| B: Sure . _Uh-huh ._ 
A|33| A: [and] [we] would [have] [to ,] we'd [and] he'd make sassafras tea _out_ [of] sassafras roots [that] he'd found [and] , _That's_ [a] _good_ family _place_ [to] _go_ , 
B|34| B: [Oh [,] that's] _neat_ . Sure . 
A|35| A: [and] then [the] river [was] [really] [nice] _because_ [it wasn't] _too_ frightening _, but_ [it wasn't] [, you know ,] _too_ easy either . 
B|36| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|37| A: [It was] like , 
B|38| B: _Well [,_ you] learn [a lot of] [, um ,] skills [too] [, and] [I think] _you're_ more receptive [when] _you're_ younger than [when] _you're_ older [, to] learn new skills , 
A|39| A: _That's_ true . 
B|40| B: [and] [I think] [they] [really] [it] [really] penetrates [in] your memory [, you know ,] _what_ [to] [do] _, because_ [you] [really] _have _a_ great_ interest [in] [it] . Because [it's] something [you] weren't forced [to] [do] 
A|41| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|42| B: _so you_ [have] [kind _of] a_ relaxed mode [of] learning . 
A|43| A: [Yeah .] 
B|44| B: [And] _you're_ more receptive . 
A|45| A: [Well [,] that's] _good _._ Well [,_ we] [, um ,] let's _see _,_ the_ [only] other _place_ I've ever vacationed , we'd [, you know ,] _go_ on camping trips [up] [to] Texoma [and] things like _that ._ 
B|46| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: [And] then [I] went _to England_ _a few_ _years_ ago . 
B|48| B: [Oh [,] that's] exciting . 
A|49| A: [I] [was] [a] , student [there] [and] spent [, um ,] [a] semester studying abroad [in] London . 
B|50| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|51| A: [And that was] [a great] _time [,_ because] [it's] [so] [, that's] such [a] [neat] _place_ [and] [it's] , there's _not_ [a] language barrier [so you] don't [, I] mean , [there] there's [a little bit [,] because] there's [some] [of] those English words [that] [you] [just] don't exactly [know] [what] [they] mean [, and] [a lot of] people [have] trouble wrestling [with] _their_ accents _, but_ [it's] _, it was_ [really] fun _. [I_ , [I] , I] [really enjoyed] _that ._ I'm _probably_ going _back_ _there to_ work , _for_ [a] [year] . 
B|52| B: [Uh-huh [.] Well _,] _I had_ a friend_ [that] [, uh ,] visited [England] [not] , well [, I think] [it's] [been] [probably] two [years] now [, but] [that's] her _next_ goal [, and] she _can_ [do] [it] , [is] _go back_ [to England] [, because] she [really] has [a great] desire [to] [do] [that] [, because] [the] _love_ [that] she [, um ,] has [for] [it] now after visiting [it] . 
A|53| A: [It] , [it's] [really] [nice _.] I_ would [, I] would spend [all] [my] _time_ [in] London , or [most] [of] [my] _time ,_ 
B|54| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|55| A: [and that's] [it was] [really] different being [in] [a] big city [, because] [I] don't [get] much into urban [, you know ,] [really] urban areas [a lot] 
B|56| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|57| A: [and] [it was ,] [it's] [really] , [it's] sort [of a] weird [little] anonymous feeling where no one _knows_ who [you] are [and] [you] [can] spend [a whole] day without _talking_ [to] anyone , which [I] thought [I] would [just] hate [, but] [it] ended [up] being [kind of] [nice] [because] [you're] [not] accountable [to] anyone . 
B|58| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|59| A: _You_ could [just kind of] [kind of] walk _around_ [and] observe , 
B|60| B: Do your own [thing .] [Yeah .] 
A|61| A: [I] _did_ [a lot of] [just] going _out_ by myself [and] riding on [the] subway [and] watching people . 
B|62| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [And] [I had [a] great] _time_ doing _that [._ It was] [really] interesting . 
B|64| B: [That's] wonderful _. There's_ [a lot] [out] [there _to] [see_ ,] 
A|65| A: [Yeah [,] I] [know ,] 
B|66| B: I'll _say_ . 
A|67| A: [I] keep wanting [to get] [up] [to [,] I] haven't [, I] haven't [been] anywhere else outside [the] United States _. I_ haven't [been to] [Mexico] or _Canada_ or , 
B|68| B: [Well [,] I] [lived] across [the] street almost [from] [Canada] 
A|69| A: [Oh] . 
B|70| B: [So] _that was [,_ that] [, that's] [a nice] [place] . [Canada] [is] _very_ [nice .] 
A|71| A: [Yeah [,] that] would be [nice _.] [I_ had a friend] [from] [there .] 
B|72| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|73| A: Then [I ,] I'd [love] [to] [go] somewhere [in] Asia [, but] I'd [have] [to] [have a] tour guide [with] me [to] help [with] [all the] language [and] [all] _that ._ 
B|74| B: [Oh ,] yes , absolutely . Sure , somebody [that] [knows] [their] way [around] . 
A|75| A: [So] , yeah [, _that's] why_ [, _that's] why_ [England] _was [nice_ .] Even [, we] traveled [in] Europe [for] _about_ [a] week [, and that was] even [nice] [because] [there] [wasn't] [, uh _,] _the_ ,_ [most] [the] _places_ [we] went [, we] went [to] Germany [and] Switzerland [and] , 
B|76| B: [Well ,] you've [been] quite [a few] [places] [there] 
A|77| A: [Yeah [,] we] [have] . We . We _did_ [, we] whirlwinded through , Europe . 
B|78| B: Once [you] [think] [about] [it] , huh . [Uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: [It was] [just] insane twelve days where we'd [just] stop like [a] city [a] day [, and] [you] slept on [the] train [at] night . 
B|80| B: [Oh [,] that's] [great] . 
A|81| A: But [there] [wasn't] [a] _, it was_ strange _, it was_ [kind of] sad , [there] [wasn't] ever [a] language problem [there] [, because] everyone [in] Germany knew English [and] everyone [in] Switzerland , knew English . 
B|82| B: [Uh-huh _.] That's_ [great] . 
A|83| A: [So] [we] were [kind of] pitiful . We found one restaurant [we] were [in] [and] got seated [, and] then no one knew English [in] [there] [, and] [we] were [just] finally [had] [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking [up] things . 
B|84| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|85| A: But [it was ,] 
B|86| B: What [did] [you] wind [up] [with] ? 
A|87| A: [Oh [,] I had] fondue . That [was] easy [to] [say] 
B|88| B: [Oh [,] okay] 
A|89| A: Tried [to get] fondue [and] white wine [, and [that was] ,] 
B|90| B: Uh , uh-huh . 
A|91| A: [we] were able [to] [have] [that] pretty , pretty effortlessly . There were [some] people [at] [the] [next] table who spoke English _, so_ [we] elicited [their] aid [for] [a] while 
B|92| B: They [kind of] guided _you ._ 
A|93| A: [and] , [they] were [very] helpful 
B|94| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [so] , [It was _,] it was_ [a] pleasant _time_ . 
B|96| B: [Well ,] [good .] 
A|97| A: I'd , I'd [love] [to] [go back] [there [.] There's] [just] [not] _time_ [There's] [not] enough _time_ [to] [go] [see] everything [, and] then [to] afford [to see] everything . 
B|98| B: [I guess] [that's why] [we] need [to] plan [for] retirement [, so] [when we] [do] [have] [the] free [time ,] we'll [have] [the [,] the] means [to [,] uh ,] pursue our dreams . 
A|99| A: Right [. That's] 
B|100| B: [Yeah [.] [I] guess] [that's] [what] retirement [is] [all] [about] . 
A|101| A: That [and] sleeping late 
B|102| B: Yes . 
A|103| A: [I] keep hoping [for] . 
B|104| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [Well] _it was nice talking with [you_ .] 
B|106| B: [I] understand [that [.] Well [,] [it was] nice talking with you] [too] , Craig . 
A|107| A: [And] [have a] [good] afternoon . 
B|108| B: [You] [do] [the] same . 
A|109| A: [Okay .] 
B|110| B: Thank [you .] 
A|111| A: Good-bye .
