B|58| B: Kind [of] [, uh ,] little guy [in [there] .] He , he [, uh ,] gives reasonable _prices_ . 
A|59| A: [Oh] . 
B|60| B: Like [I , I] traded [my] [, uh ,] _three eighty-six_ _for the_ four [eighty-six] [for] [about] six hundred . 
A|61| A: Really ? _Well ,_ that's _a good_ deal . 
B|62| B: _Yeah ,_ [it] _was_ pretty reasonable . 
A|63| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|64| B: _But_ [, uh , uh ,] he [, and] he does [a good] job [and] he , he , he [, uh ,] guarantees everything he sells . 
A|65| A: [Uh ,] [there is a] lot [, you] ever _go_ by Lucky Computer [there] ? 
B|66| B: [Uh-huh [,] yeah .] 
A|67| A: [I] used [to] _, when_ _I was_ putting shop _floor_ computers together [for] guys , I'd _go_ [and] _get_ their units [and put] them together [and] _go_ [and] interface [the] [stuff] _with_ our systems .

A|73| A: [I] tell [you] , those [prices] [have] [just] , unbelievably come down . 
B|74| B: [Uh-huh ,] oh [, yeah] _, I was_ amazed [I was] able [to] [get this] four [eighty-six] [for] six hundred even [with] [a] trade [in] [, you] [know] , it's [like] , wow 
A|75| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|76| B: _That_ works , _I'll_ [go] [do] [that] 
A|77| A: [I ,] 
B|78| B: [And] boy [that] thing screams now . 
A|79| A: [Yeah [,] I [was] kind of] surprised how rapidly [they] bypassed [, _the] three [eighty-six_ .] [That] wasn't alive [for] but maybe two years . 
B|80| B: [Uh-huh] [. [Well ,] I] thought [was] funny [that] [they] kept pushing [the three eighty-six] [S] X even though [the [,] the] price difference [is] [about] ten dollars . 
A|81| A: Is [that] [right] ? [That's] [it] ? 
B|82| B: [Yeah ,] [it] [, when] [it] comes [on] [the] manufacturing [floor] it's [about] ten bucks . 
A|83| A: [I'll] be darned .
