A|6| A: [Well ,] there _are_ [a] lot [of] [things that] _people_ [, I] think general , 
B|7| B: [And] _then_ _it_ [just] frosts [me] terribly . 
A|8| A: [Well [,] I] think it's interesting _to_ look at [, uh ,] where [the] [money] goes [, [and] it] goes [a] lot [of] places where [it] probably ought [not] go [and] [and] [I] don't think generally [, I] think what's interesting [is] [that] _we_ probably represent [the] majority [of] _people_ in [this] country in terms [of] their feelings [about the] government 
B|9| B: Absolutely . 
A|10| A: [and] [how] [it] serves _us_ given [the] extraordinarily large sum [of] [money] [the] government has _to_ operate [with] . 
B|11| B: [I] believe _that's_ true , yes . 
A|12| A: [And] _that ,_ _what_ [I] think [is going] _to_ be _really_ interesting [is] _what_ _we_ do [about] _it [._ [I] mean ,] _we_ _are_ [going] _to_ have _to_ change _the people_ who represent _us_ . 
B|13| B: _That's_ correct . 
A|14| A: [I mean [,] and] [I] think it's [going] _to_ be real interesting _to_ _see_ [and [,] and] [then] force upon them [, uh ,] 
B|15| B: Heavy involvement _from_ _the public_ . 
A|16| A: _Yeah ,_ _right_ [that's] [I] think [that's the] _only_ [thing] [that's] [going] _to_ change _it ._ 
B|17| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] heavy involvement _from_ _the public_ . 
A|18| A: Our anger [is going] _to_ have _to_ , _to_ give rise _to_ , _to_ more activity [on] [our] part . 
B|19| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|20| A: [Uh ,] I've , I've said [for] years [that] _there's_ full employment [for] [the] politically active [and] in [our] society [, uh _,] there's_ _very_ little full employment . Most _people_ in [this] country _are_ getting worse off [, not] better off . 
B|21| B: Absolutely . 
A|22| A: Eighty percent [of [the] public] , according _to_ Bill Moyers' [, uh ,] recent [, uh ,] piece [for] [, uh ,] Public Broadcasting , which , by [the] [way] [is] [a] _very_ good use [of] government [money [.] I] think P B S [is] wonderful . But [this] special focused [on] [the] fact [that] eighty percent [of _the] people_ in [this] country _are_ , _are_ seeing their real incomes [, and] thus , standards [of] living , decline . [And] twenty percent _are_ seeing theirs improve . [That's] [not] [a] formula [for] [a] better society . 
B|23| B: No , _it is_ [not] . It's lopsided , [very] _much_ so . 
A|24| A: [And] [the] government _really_ plays [a] role in [this] . 
B|25| B: Uh-huh _, that's_ [right] [, they] pull [the] _strings_ . 
A|26| A: [I mean ,] well [, they] _are_ _the people_ whose [strings] _are_ pulled [and] by [I] guess powerful 
B|27| B: _Right_ , [the] , yeah 
A|28| A: _You know [,_ and] it's _really_ interesting _to_ _see_ [how] [that] affects _people_ because essentially more [and] more _people_ in [this] country _are_ [not] likely _to_ revolt in [the] [way] [that] _people_ used _to_ think [of] , [of the] voter revolting . But _people_ _are_ pretty [much] getting [the] _picture_ [that] [some] _people_ get taken care [of] [and] others don't [and they] think it's unfair [, and] when [they] recognize [that] it's their [tax money] , they're [going] _to_ do more [about] _it [._ I] I'll tell [you] one quick [, uh ,] one [thing] [very] interesting . C B S , after [the] State [of the] Union address [is going] _to_ open up [a] telephone line , an eight hundred number [and] _people_ can call in [and] say _what_ [they] think [about] what's _going on_ in [this] country . 
B|29| B: Uh-huh . 
A|30| A: They expect , opening [it] [for] one hour , [that] they'll get three , hundred thousand telephone calls . 
B|31| B: I'm sure [they] will . 
A|32| A: [And] I've thought [for] years _it would_ make [a] lot [of] sense _to_ create an eight hundred number [for] voters _to_ call [and [,] and] vent their frustration [with] government . Like one , eight hundred capitol or something like [that] . _You know ,_ [just] [a] number [you] could call [from] anywhere , anytime . 
B|33| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
A|34| A: [I] think [that's] coming [and] [I] think once , once _people_ _really_ start _to_ communicate [how] [they] feel , [things] _are_ [going] _to_ change . Until [then] [, I] think _, you know ,_ it's [going] _to_ be _really_ painful . So [the] question [is] [, how] soon _are_ _we_ [going] _to_ start _to_ get [our] money's worth [and ,] as [you] said , it's [how] soon _we_ get involved [, and] [I] think _we_ need _to_ create mechanisms _to_ allow _us_ _to_ get involved , like allowing _us_ _to_ call [a] toll free number [and] say , hey , look , do [it] [this] [way [,] not] [that] [way ,] or [I] like [this ,] or [I] don't like _that ,_ or [this] [is] [how] [I] feel [about] your spending [my] [money] [on] art [that I] don't think [is] art . 
B|35| B: Yes [, I] understand [that ,] but hopefully [that] [the people] [that] [are] listening [to] [what] [our] comments [are] take [some] action [on] [it .] 
A|36| A: [Well [,] that's the] good [thing] [about] [what] [is] happening because [I] think more [and] more [the] news media , which takes [a] heck [of] [a] beating [and [,] and] deserves [some _of] it_ , [is] telling _us_ _, you know [,_ about the] problems . So [the] more _we_ communicate , hey , look , _we_ want [a] change here , because _, you know ,_ as [it] turns out , we've wasted [a] tremendous amount [of] [money] [on] [our] defense spending in [this] country . 
B|37| B: Oh , absolutely . 
A|38| A: Over [a] [very] long period [of] time . 
B|39| B: _Right_ , absolutely . 
A|40| A: [Uh [,] [and] [,] uh ,] 
B|41| B: We [only] [see] [the] tip [of the] iceberg [only] . 
A|42| A: [Right] . 
B|43| B: [You know [,] there's] so [much] [of it] [going on] [that] [it would] [really] [, you know [,] uh ,] set [us] into [a] deeper depression if [we] knew [the] whole [picture] . 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] [Well [,] you] may be [right] . What [I] think [is] [really] [going] [to] be interesting [is] [to] [see] [how] [, uh ,] [we] as [a] society deal [with] [it] [and] [I [,] and] [I] think [it is] , [what] [you] say , it's , it's [a] ,
