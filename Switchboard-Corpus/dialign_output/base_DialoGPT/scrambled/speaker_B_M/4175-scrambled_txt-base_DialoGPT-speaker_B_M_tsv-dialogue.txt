B|71| M: Yup . uuh 
A|72| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] his thousandth [and] one appeal , [the] state [of California] revoked [the] law [in the] early seventies , [and] then [they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty [didn't] [go] back . [You] [know] ?

A|88| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh [. [I] [,] [I] agree] we're [the] largest munitions producer [in the] world , [and] so , uh , there's [a lot] [of] money [to] be made [there] , [and] [it's] , uh , be very difficult [to] , [to] cut [it] back [to] [a] , [a] level where [it] should be . 
B|89| M:  
A|90| B: [and] , [you know ,] even [, [I] don't know] [if] that's because plants [are] _just_ [that] way [and] [they] like rain , or [, it] seems [they] thrive when [it] rains , [they] _just_ , really , 
B|91| M: No [, I] mean , I'll [just] ask [them] [about it] . 
A|92| B: [I] [just] [don't] like [the] cold . 
B|93| M: Yes [. We] [did] . 
A|94| B: [And] [I was] reading [this] book one [time] [about] [this] guy [that] [had] , uh [, I] [think] [the] company still exists . What [they] use [to do] [is] , [they] used [to] cut [the] number [of] hours [for] everybody as opposed [to] [just] laying people off [you [know] .]
