B|59| M: [Yeah .] [It's] [not] _a lot of_ fun . 
A|60| B: [And] [I] often find [that] [even] when [I don't] feel [that] much _like_ exercising _, like_ _I'll_ [be] really tired , _and_ _I'll_ start swimming , _and_ _I'll_ , _and_ _I'll_ actually _get_ energy . [And] _I'll_ _be ,_ [have] much more energy when [I'm] done than when [I] started [, I] _mean [,_ I] [just] feel great . That happens _to me_ probably one [in] four or five times [that] [I] swim . 
B|61| M: There's _a lot of_ houses [in] [the] neighborhood 
A|62| B: [Yeah] _, but_ , [so] [I'm] kind [of] [, you know ,] [just] playing _with [it_ _,] but_ at [this] [point] we're [going to] kind [of] wait _, I think_ [just] more [for the] financial reasons [of] [it] anyway _but_ , 
B|63| M: They _are_ . They [have] _a lot of_ [people] teaching [it .] 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: Wait , [what] ? 
A|66| B: Besides which _, it_ _would_ [be] easier [, uh ,] there's [a lot of] single mothers out there now , [from] divorces _and_ [a lot of] , women [are] starting [to] [have] babies without [a] partner . 
B|67| M: True [. I'm] [not] saying [that] [the] military [is] [the] only branch [of the] US government . 
A|68| B: But _that's_ probably paying [for] _things_ [that] [were] [still] owed [from] [last] [time] , 
B|69| M:  
A|70| B: [Yeah] , [yeah] _, [I think_ so] 
B|71| M: Nope [, no] 
A|72| B: Are [you] [for] [it] ?

B|81| M: [No] 
A|82| B: Uh-huh . Oh [, you] [, you] [, you] [don't] plan _on_ putting [any] , [any] [of that] [in] ? 
B|83| M: [I'm] [not] [going to] answer [that] question , you're [not] [the same] _guy_ . 
A|84| B: _and_ _my_ daughter's [been] [going] _with_ [the same] boy [for a] while _, but_ she's [still] [in] college _and_ we're [just] [as] happy [for] her [to] finish her education first . 
B|85| M: [I've] [been] [on the] train [to] [him] since [I] _was a_ kid . 
A|86| B: Uh , she works at home some , though . 
B|87| M: [I've] seen [it] _too_ [, it's] [a lot of] [things] . 
A|88| B: Oh [, it's] [good] _and_ [it's] healthy , [too] . 
B|89| M:  ...

A|96| B: _and_ [so] [we] _use_ those _and_ there's some , whenever _we go_ over _and_ visit grandma [the] kids _love_ [to] [play] [the] computer game , [so] , _that's_ part [of] [it .] 
B|97| M: What's wrong ? 
A|98| B: [Well] . 
B|99| M: [I] used [a lot of] brown rice _, but [I_ did] [use] brown rice . 
A|100| B: [I know ,] [we] wondered [about] [that] . But [, uh ,] oh [that] [was a] traumatic experience [for] [us] [too] . 
B|101| M: [I'll] [play] [with] [your] hand 
A|102| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] Uh-huh .

A|104| B: Uh [yeah] 
B|105| M: [I think] [that's] [how] [it] should [be [,] I think] [they] [would] [get] away [with it] [if] [it] wasn't [for] 
A|106| B: [Yeah] [, but] at [the same] [time] [, [I] don't] [know [,] it's] pretty far [to] throw [that] far [I] couldn't [do] [it .] 
B|107| M: Tiberius [is] [the] puppy [and the] dog . 
A|108| B: Huh . 
B|109| M: Don't [, they] don'you , 'they [do] , ' 
A|110| B: [Yeah] , well [, you know [,] you just] [have to] decide [, you know ,] well there's really two separate decisions there [I] guess , one _is ,_ [did] [it] really happen [the] way [the] , [the] prosecutor said [it] happened [, you know [,] is] [this] man really guilty , [and] [you] [have to] decide [that] [, but] then [you] [have to] decide [, you know ,] [as] [a] member [of] society [what] [do] [I] want [to] [do] [with] [this] [guy] who [did] [this] _thing_ . 
B|111| M: [I'm] [not] 
A|112| B: But [, uh ,] [so] [, you] [do] recycle , [don't] [you] ? 
B|113| M: [I think] [we go] [to [the] same] [school .] 
A|114| B: [Yeah] , [yeah] , well [I] [, I] went [to] Dallas [, uh ,] when [I] worked [for] T [I] [in] Abilene [and] [, uh [,] I'm] [a little] familiar [with] [the] city area , Forest Lane [and] [, you know ,] through [that] , off , off [the] freeway . 
B|115| M: [I think] [I'll] [see] ya . 
A|116| B: But [I] [, I'm] interested [in] [a lot [of] that] [, but] [, uh [,] [I] have] got [a lot of] books [that] [I] [, I] intend [to] read [, but [I] have] [not] [been] able [to] yet [, you know ,] [for] one reason or another . 
B|117| M: [I think] [it is] [good] . For [you] 
A|118| B: To worry [about] [it .] 
B|119| M: [It's] [the] Carter Administration 
A|120| B: Oh . 
B|121| M: Ow [, I] [love] [my] hobbies . 
A|122| B: [Yeah] our biggest way [of] saving money [is] then [to] stop [all] these deductions , um [, you know [,] is] [to] , let's [see] , now [, I] forget which way [we] [do] [it .] [We] [don't] list [all] [the] deductions [and] then [we] [get] more money back [, you know ,] at [the] end [of the] [year] , 
B|123| M: The weird [thing] [is [,] it] doesn't look [like] [anything [to] me] . 
A|124| B: Right . [Yeah] [, I know] [what] [you mean]
