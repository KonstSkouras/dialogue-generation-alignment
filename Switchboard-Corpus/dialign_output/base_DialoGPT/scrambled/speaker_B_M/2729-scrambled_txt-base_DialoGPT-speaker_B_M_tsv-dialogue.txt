B|65| M: [I think] [it's] [the] most important [question] [I] [have] . 
A|66| B: Um , actually , when [I was] younger [, [I] was] [a] Cardinal fan , too . 
B|67| M: He's gonna [be] [on the] mound

A|72| B: [Well ,] we've _been_ here since sixty-six . 
B|73| M:  
A|74| B: [and] [just] [a] lot [of] things [that] we're trying [to] worry [about] _, you_ _know_ , protecting these [people] _from_ , _we_ [just] [don't] protect [them .] 
B|75| M: [I ,] 
A|76| B: _Yeah ,_ pizzas [and] spaghettis [and] lasagnas [and] [that] kind [of] stuff . 
B|77| M: [We] _could_ [have] 
A|78| B: Right , _it's ,_ _it's ,_ [it's] [just] south [of] [there .] 
B|79| M: [I think] [I] read [it] 
A|80| B: _but_ [he] [was] living alone , [had] [an] upstairs apartment , [could] barely make [it] up [the] steps [to] [the] top without [a] great deal [of] pain , 
B|81| M: [I] _live _in_ Texas_ [and] [I'm] [so] confused . 
A|82| B: _How_ [about] yourself ? 
B|83| M: _Where are you_ ? 
A|84| B: _but_ [I'm not sure] [that] [that's] really [that] _much_ [of] [the] _problem ._ 
B|85| M: u wot m8 
A|86| B: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: He [is] [just] [going _to] go_ [get] [a] _nice_ pizza 
A|88| B: Pardon me ? 
B|89| M: [I] 
A|90| B: _You know_ _, in_ case _, you_ _know_ _, in_ case [you] ever need [to] bail out 
B|91| M: [I'm] _pretty_ [much] . 
A|92| B: [and] [they] brought up [what] happened [in] Killeen here recently [, and] [they were] saying _, you_ _know_ , [that] these guys want attention [, and] [that] when [it] happens _they're_ glorified because _all_ [the] newspaper , [it's] [on] _all_ [the] newspapers [and] T V [and] _everything_ , 
B|93| M: He jumped _in [, in_ the] river . 
A|94| B: _Uh_ . 
B|95| M: [No] [problem .] Good luck [with] [everything] . 
A|96| B: Bye-bye . 
B|97| M: Ugh . [I'm] sorry , [but] [I [don't] think] [it's] worth [the] trouble . 
A|98| B: _Uh ,_ [there] [was] certainly nothing _like a_ , [a] bathroom , [a] shower [or] anything , near by [It was] dig your own hole [and] [, uh] [and] [I] [I'm not sure] I'd do [that] [that] anymore , 
B|99| M: Uhhh , [you're] [not] even [on] [my] list . 
A|100| B: [I'm] serious . 
B|101| M: [I'm not , I'm] [just] [being] [a] [naive] person 
A|102| B: So [I] guess [that] makes [it] easy [to] recycle [and] then _they're_ _, they're_ [, uh ,] trying [to] make plastic goods [that] [don't] _have a_ bunch [of] different plastics [in] [them] _, you_ _know_ , [that] [are] , [that] [are] only made out [of] one kind [of] plastic [so] [that] [that] makes [it] easier [I] guess . 
B|103| M: [Yeah .] I've [been] struggling along [that] line lately . 
A|104| B: So _, you_ _know_ , [if] [, [I] think] [that's] [a] [good] way [for] [people] [to] _, you_ _know_ , maybe [get] [people] [to] come back [to] these small towns [to] work by helping [people] [that] normally might [not] [be] able [to go] [to] college [and] [get] [the] type [of] degree [they] want . 
B|105| M: [It] . 
A|106| B: [Yeah .] [No [,] that's] true . Course [they _have] a_ requirement [that] [, uh ,] [that] every single appeal must [be] permitted . 
B|107| M: [It's] [not] [about] feeling [good] [. It's] [about] feeling happy . 
A|108| B: _And_ [so] [, uh _,] you_ _know_ , at work [a] lot [of] [people] [are] _, you_ _know_ [, [I] think] well [this is] [not] [a] normal situation anymore [in] our [, in] our world _we_ [live in] . Most [of] [them] [, uh ,] continue [to] work [if] [they have] , [have] kids . 
B|109| M: [Uh [,] they] ? 
A|110| B: [We] , _we_ usually collect [a] _, you_ _know_ , collect [a] quite _a bit_ [and] then _we_ take [them] , take [them] [in] . 
B|111| M: [I'm] [a bit] _of a_ corn guy . 
A|112| B: [It's] [, uh ,] [pretty] [nice] . Unfortunately , [the] builder who built [it] went out [of] business [already] 
B|113| M: [And] _it's , uh ,_ prison . 
A|114| B: Huh . 
B|115| M: [You know] [that .] 
A|116| B: _Yeah [,_ [I'm] [in] Texas] . [Where are you] at ? 
B|117| M: today s young [people] [will] [be] short term pleasure oriented 
A|118| B: [Uh ,] copperheads mostly , 
B|119| M: [Yeah ,] [but] [if] [you] [don't] [feel] [it] [, you] [don't know] [how] [to] [feel] . 
A|120| B: [Uh [,] and] [it's [, uh ,] I] guess [what] [they] call [a] story [and] [a] half . Because [it's] [not] [a] full two story . [Where] [, you] [know] , [everything] [on] top [is] [on] bottom . 
B|121| M: [It] [is] ... 
A|122| B: [I] would imagine [that] I'll [, uh ,] [if] something happens , I'll move one [of] [them] [or] [you] [know] [, [in] , in] [with] me . 
B|123| M: [I think] [they] did [have a] garage . 
A|124| B: [Oh] , [my] God . 
B|125| M: We're [not] [all] [from] [the] north . 
A|126| B: [You] [go] [to] school [and] [you] [have a] kind [of a] captive audience , [get] [them] [all] [in the] auditorium , 
B|127| M: We're [in [,] uh]

B|131| M: [not] [. [I] ,] i [, [I ,] and] . 
A|132| B: [Yeah ,] right , uh-huh . 
B|133| M: Didn't [we] [get] [like a] dozen last year ? 
A|134| B: Uh-huh . 
B|135| M: You're [a bit] late [, they're] [just] getting [there .]
