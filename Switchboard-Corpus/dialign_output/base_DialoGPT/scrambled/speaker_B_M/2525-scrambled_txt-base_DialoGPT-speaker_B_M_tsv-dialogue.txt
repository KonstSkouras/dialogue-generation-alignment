A|30| B: Uh _, that's_ where [the] family grew . 
B|31| M: [That's] nice [, but] [I'm] [not] sure _if you_ _can_ find [a] place _to stay in_ Dallas

B|33| M: [I] [like] [it .] 
A|34| B: Uh-huh . _Yeah ,_ yeah [, and] [you] [don't] want [to stay _in] the_ very , very , very exclusive , because [you] [don't] really [even] [get] [a] flavor _of the_ country [if] you're , 
B|35| M: [I] 
A|36| B: [So] [if you] look at Russia [and] what's happened over [there] [, I] [think] [the] change [in] Communism _was_ as [a] result _of the_ economic problems _that_ [they] were experiencing .

B|37| M: What ? 
A|38| B: Uh-huh 
B|39| M: [You] [know .]

A|42| B: [I] mean , some _of the_ , 
B|43| M: _So ,_ [are] [you]

B|45| M: Oddo . 
A|46| B: [And] [they] had misclassed [the] sex [of] back [there] [and] _so_ , um _, she_ asked me [if] [I] want [to] , one [of] those babies [, and I] took [the] baby [and I] got her when _she was_ [, you know ,] [just] this tiniest [little] _thing_ _like ,_ half [the] price [of a] mouse , 
B|47| M: [the] [thing] [, I'm] [not] sure . 
A|48| B: Right . 
B|49| M: That _, I _don't know_ ._ 
A|50| B: _Yeah_ . Uh-huh . [I] mean [, I] [, I] tend [to] agree [with] [you] . [I] [think] [, uh ,] [what] [I] would [like] [to] see [is] , number one , completely getting rid [of] these victimless crimes . Uh , there's [no] reason [to] enforce those [and] spend time [and] money doing [it] [and] [, and] worry _about_ these things where [people] [are] getting hurt . 
B|51| M: [Well [,] I] came [from] Texas [, and] _my_ mother [was] [from] Florida 
A|52| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|53| M: How 
A|54| B: _Yeah _,_ she_ [just] appeared . 
B|55| M: [You] [are] correct . 
A|56| B: _Oh_ , uh-huh . 
B|57| M: Uhh , _I've_ _never_ been _there ._ 
A|58| B: [And] you're more receptive . 
B|59| M: Not . Yet . 
A|60| B: Uh-huh . 
B|61| M: Heh , [the] guy [in the] video _said_ [that] he broke [in] . 
A|62| B: But [, I] [think] [people] [try to] , on , on T V [I] [think] [, they] [try to] throw [in] good stuff [, but] [it] doesn't [, uh ,] [it] doesn't sway [the] vote . 
B|63| M: [Oh] . [I'm] sorry 
A|64| B: [That's] true [if] , [if] it's on [the] credit card [it] doesn't seem [like] it's money out [of] your pocket . Sometimes [you] may [think] , well [, I [don't] have] [the] money _so_ [you] use [the] credit card it's [like] fake money or something . 
B|65| M: [The] first girl [she] tried [with] [, [she] was] [like] 15 [, and] [she was] pretty [hot] . 
A|66| B: _Yeah ,_ [it] [is] . It really [is] . 
B|67| M: Wait , [so] [what ?] 
A|68| B: Uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [I'm ,] [like] ... [a] dump , [like ,] dump , dump . 
A|70| B: [and] it's very hard for me because [, you know ,] it's [like] [you] grow up [to be] twenty years old [, and] it's always _the same_ man 
B|71| M: [I'm] . 
A|72| B: _Yeah_ . [That's] true . 
B|73| M: You're welcome . 
A|74| B: Uh-huh . [That's] great . 
B|75| M:  
A|76| B: [I] [, I don't know] [what] Foley's [is] 
B|77| M: We [don't] . 
A|78| B: _No_ . _No_ , [no] . Nissan [is] Japanese . 
B|79| M: [Yeah ,] _my_ daughter graduated [from] High School . 
A|80| B: [And , uh] . [The] [thing] _about_ [it] [, you know ,] now [that] [I've] found , [is] [that] [we] [get] such good coverage on T V , or at least such [, I don't [know] ,] attempted thoroughness [of] coverage , by [the] time [you] [get] [the] TIME MAGAZINE , there's nothing [in] [it] [you] [don't know .] 
B|81| M: Australia ? 
A|82| B: _Because_ _if they_ turn around [, they] [can] [get] away [, they] [get] away [with] [it] [, and they] [get] away [with] [it] [, and they] [get] away [with] [it] [, and] then [they] do something worse 
B|83| M: That 
A|84| B: [So ,] it's , it's [a] really tough question . [That's] _right_ . 
B|85| M: [No] 
A|86| B: [So] am [I] . 
B|87| M: [Because] [, uh ,] politicians [don't] talk [about] waste . 
A|88| B: _And if_ it's , [a] loving environment [, I] [think] it's very good [and] [, and] _that's_ really [what] we've learned [about] [it .] She'll [have to] _go_ on [to] something more stimulating [in] terms [of] preschool [in] [a] year 
B|89| M: [You] [know] [that's] [a] lie _right ?_ 
A|90| B: Um . 
B|91| M: [I] did sue him . 
A|92| B: [Oh] wow . 
B|93| M: Ummow 
A|94| B: [and they] had all kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and] everything [, you know ,] all out [in] this , [in the] , [in] this schoolyard [there .] [So] [we just] [said] , hey , let's stop [and] [and] [the] kids got [to] _go_ around [and] [, you know ,] see pigs [and] animals [and] things [like] [that] , 
B|95| M:  
A|96| B: It manages [to] take care [of] all [my] home needs [in] terms [of] word processing [and] spreadsheets [and] [, uh ,] databases , database searches . 
B|97| M: uuhh [, uh] 
A|98| B: For instance [, uh [,] I] saw [a] [thing] on [, uh ,] NOVA [, I] [think] [it] [was] [the] other day . 
B|99| M: [I'm] sorry [, but [I] don't] understand [the] appeal process . 
A|100| B: [it] [was] [just] strange . 
B|101| M:  
A|102| B: [I] mean , teenagers [in] our country [are] kind [of] , kind [of a] year [that] parents [don't] look forward [to] [and] [, and] things [like] [that] 
B|103| M: [I'm] [not] [even] sure . 
A|104| B: Uh [, we] probably were listening [to] C N N fairly heavily before [the] war broadcasts began . Uh [, we] almost live [and] [, and] breathed [it] for , because during [the] war itself [to] [the] point where [we] began [to] sort [of] [have] household pact [of] lets turn [the] war off [and] [get] something done . 
B|105| M: [Well [,] that's] [not] [a] place . 
A|106| B: Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: It's [a] reference [to] Lord [of the] Rings . 
A|108| B: [Oh] [that's] good . [Oh] [we just] [, uh ,] [just] love them . They [, uh , you know ,] [get] [to] feeling [so] lovey [and] dovey [and] they'll come up [and] [just] start kneading [in] our chest [and] it's [like] oh , your claws need trimming . 
B|109| M: [I [don't know] .] 
A|110| B: when [I] lived [in] Washington [, uh ,] Washington , D C [, I] [never] went [to] [the] Washington Memorial [, and] then when [I] went back [to] visit [, I] went [to] [the] Washington Memorial . 
B|111| M: [The] movie [was] called [the same] [thing] . 
A|112| B: [And] then after [they] had [to] start paying [to] move us , [that] suddenly wasn't necessary any more 
B|113| M: Do [you] ? 
A|114| B: Right . 
B|115| M: [I'm] [a] dog . 
A|116| B: But [, you know ,] some [of the] [get] ridiculous . TRAVEL AND LEISURE , all [of the] AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines 
B|117| M: [And [if] [they] are] [in the] hospital [, they] [go] . 
A|118| B: [Yeah ,] well [, I] [, I] do [, uh , you know ,] craft [work] [and] sell stuff at shows [and] [that] [, and] [uh [,] uh , you know ,] it's , it's , it's [a] real eye-opener as far as [, you know ,] why [people] charge [what] [they] do [to] [, you [know] .] 
B|119| M: [uh [,] and] 
A|120| B: [Well [,] uh ,] okay . Now [that's] inside again , [right ?] 
B|121| M: [I'm] sorry [, I'm] [a] [little] confused .
