A|0| B: _Right ._ 
B|1| M: She's _not a_ teacher . 
A|2| B: Uh-huh . 
B|3| M: _That's_ _what_ _I_ _was_ _thinking_ . 
A|4| B: _and_ _we_ had _all_ _this_ rain _, and_ _it_ _really_ _is_ [not a] _bad_ _summer_ at _all_ , _really_ cool . _But_ _all _of_ a_ sudden , _in_ , _in_ _, uh ,_ _in_ October _, uh ,_ September , October _it_ _got_ real hot _and_ dry _and_ _just_ stayed _that_ _way_ _for_ [a] long time . _And_ _, uh ,_ _then_ _the_ end _of_ October _it_ started rain almost [a] _week_ without stopping , _just_ pouring down _, _you_ _know_ ._ _There were_ flash floods everywhere , _that_ _kind of_ _deal _,_ and_ _then_ _uh ,_ into _of_ November _, _the_ first_ , _like_ _the_ second _week_ _, uh _,_ _you_ _know_ _,_ _the_ first_ _week_ actually , _we_ had , _we_ had [a] freeze , 
B|5| M: Is [this] 
A|6| B: _But_ _, I_ love _it ._ [I] love _the_ culture _, uh _,_ the_ _way_ _that_ _they_ _, uh _,_ they_ respect education _and_ their teachers their parents , _so_ _much_ _more than_ , _than_ _my_ children _do _._ You know ,_ 
B|7| M: He's [a] _good_ boy 
A|8| B: _Oh ,_ _really_ . 
B|9| M: [And] [they] _get_ _them_ _out_ . 
A|10| B: _Yes_ . 
B|11| M: _That's_ [not] _really a_ _good_ [deal _,] is_ [it] ? 
A|12| B: _Well , I_ _can_ tell _you_ , _that_ _the_ Mets opened _, _I_ think_ , two days ago , 
B|13| M: _We_ [do] _a lot_ [more than] _that ._ 
A|14| B: _and_ [they] liked [that .] [And] _then_ on _the_ _way_ _home_ _we_ drove by _the_ local high _school_ _and_ _there_ happened _to be_ an F _A_ , F _A_ _A_ , Future F _A_ , Future Farmers _of_ America , F F _A_ _going_ on _there ,_ 
B|15| M: _I can't_ [, you] ? 
A|16| B: Uh-huh . 
B|17| M: [Yes] [, I] am . 
A|18| B: Sevren [is] east , near _the_ eastern shore , 
B|19| M: OH . 
A|20| B: _Well _,_ the_ jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him _to_ death 
B|21| M: _What_ ? 
A|22| B: _Oh _, I'm_ _,_ I'm_ [a] _dog_ _person ._ [I] had [, _I] guess_ [it] depends on [what] [you] had when he _were_ [a] kid _, right ?_ 
B|23| M: You're [not] [really] giving [it] [much] [of a] chance . 
A|24| B: when _we_ [get] an hour [more] , 
B|25| M: _Yeah _,_ that's_ [what] [I] meant . 
A|26| B: _What about_ yourself ? 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: [We] _all_ go _back_ _to_ parents' houses on _the_ weekends _, and_ [what] [not] _so_ , 
B|29| M: _Yeah _,_ it's_ _nice_ 
A|30| B: _Right ._ 
B|31| M: _I'll_ _have [you_ _know] _that_ I_ am [a] vegetarian . 
A|32| B: Uh-huh . 
B|33| M: Why [do] _you have a_ [summer] _job_ ? 
A|34| B: [Yeah] . Our _cat_ _we_ _got_ from _the_ pound _the_ day _the_ night she [was] _going to be_ put _to_ sleep . _So_ [that's] _why_ _we_ call her Liberty . 
B|35| M: [So] [what] _are_ [you] _trying _to_ say_ ? 
A|36| B: _and_ _it ,_ his mother [was] alone _, and_ _so_ [they] came [to] support her _, and_ _then_ one by one , his [you _know] ,_ his sisters , he began [to] lose family members , 
B|37| M: [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|38| B: If _you're_ , _like_ _I've_ [, I] work _with_ _, uh ,_ computer systems [a lot] . [So] [it's] _kind of_ hard [to say] [, [you] _know] ._ If _you're_ [, [you] _know] ,_ [a] brick layer , somebody _can_ look _and_ _see_ [, [you] _know] ,_ well _, yeah_ [, you] laid [, [you] _know] ,_ fifteen thousand bricks today _and_ [they] _were_ _all_ straight _and_ _your_ building didn't fall down [, [you] know] [Yeah [,] you] _did_ [a] great [job] . _But_ _if you_ build computer systems , _like_ , well [, [you] _know] ,_ [what] does [that] computer program [really] _do [,_ [you] _know] ._ Or , especially _if you_ write _like_ papers [, [you] _know] ._ Or [do] design studies or something . 
B|39| M: Pick ? 
A|40| B: [I can't] believe [that I] _, _I'm_ just_ thankful [that _I] don't_ [get] _all_ _the_ government [that I] _pay_ _for_ . 
B|41| M: _That_ _, _is_ _,_ that's_ [not a] _good_ _thing ._ 
A|42| B: _But_ , _then_ , [what] [do] _I know _,_ I don't have any_ _kids_ . _No ,_ none at _all_ 
B|43| M: [And] [it's] always _good_ _to be home_ 
A|44| B: _No _,_ uh ,_ 
B|45| M: Is [it] ? 
A|46| B: _But_ [, I] remember from her checking _around_ , she ended up staying at _the_ Arkansas House _I think_ _out in_ Arlington , something _like_ [that .] 
B|47| M:  
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [What] _are_ [you] _doing_ ? 
A|50| B: [And] _, uh ,_ _we_ made [that] decision _and_ _, uh ,_ _so_ after she had _the first_ baby , she stayed [home] . [And] _, and_ _we_ had [a] second baby _and_ she's still at [home] 
B|51| M: _It's not_ _really a_ negative . 
A|52| B: _I think it's_ great . 
B|53| M: _I don't think_ [you know] [what] [that] word means . 
A|54| B: _But_ _it was_ [good] . _I mean_ _it was_ _, _it_ ,_ at [that] time _there_ _were_ two children _and_ [they] _were_ _in_ special programs _and_ each one _was a_ little over two hundred [a] _week_ _and_ _then_ , _in_ addition [, I] paid [a] little _bit_ extra . _But the_ _kids_ _were_ , 
B|55| M: [A] man's gotta [do] [what] [a] man's [got] _to do ._ 
A|56| B: [Yeah] . 
B|57| M: _I have_ _never_ heard [that .] 
A|58| B: _Oh_ 
B|59| M: _I _would_ ._ 
A|60| B: The , [Yeah _,] they_ , their _, they_ [have] _the whole_ philosophy _, I mean , they_ _, they_ _kind of_ even brainwash themselves into [thinking] _they're_ _better ,_ which [is] _kind of_ hard [to] take 
B|61| M: [I think] [the] _point_ [of] _this is_ [that] [it] _makes_ _people_ [think it's] [a] [good] idea [to] buy drugs . 
A|62| B: [And] she works _, uh ,_ as [a] assistant manager _in_ [a] fabric store . 
B|63| M: uhuhuh [. You know _,] [if_ _you] can't_ afford [a] Ferrari [, _you] [don't_ _have] to_ . 
A|64| B: [Yeah] . 
B|65| M: [You] _should_ [have] known [better [,] the] _people who_ run [the] company _are_ _people who_ _make_ [the] decisions [for] [the] company . 
A|66| B: _I mean_ usually [, [you] [know] [,] you] go [to] work before _they're_ awake or as _they're_ getting , up [for] _school_ _and_ [you] [get] [home] _and it's_ already dark unless [it's] [summer] time [, [you] _know] ._ [And] even _in_ [summer] time , sometimes [you] [get] [home] _so_ late [that] there's [, [you] [know] [,] [you] can't] [do] anything _with_ _them ._ 
B|67| M: [that's] _a pretty_ common _thing ._ 
A|68| B: [It's] [more] [of a] [, [you] [know] ,] [a] smaller , smaller unit _, and_ [you [know] ,] _we_ , _we_ tend [to] try [to do] things [, [I] think] _with_ our immediate family , as opposed [to] [the] extended family . Of [people] [that] _we_ may or may [not] remember or [know [,] [you] [know] ,] very well . 
B|69| M:  
A|70| B: _Well [,_ that's] _right ._ Uh [, [I] think] [that] , oh , politicians talk [a lot] _about_ waste 
B|71| M: [What] ? [I'm just] kidding . 
A|72| B: [And] _so_ _yeah_ [, it's] _, uh ,_ wouldn't [have] _, I mean ,_ oh [, if] something happens [to] her . 
B|73| M:  ... [You know [,] I'm] [not] sure . 
A|74| B: _and_ , 
B|75| M: [I think it's] [the] _other_ [way] [around] . 
A|76| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|77| M: _Because_ [it's] [a] random . org poll . 
A|78| B: [A] [good] weather man , 
B|79| M: [But the] question _is ,_ [why] ? 
A|80| B: [Yeah] . 
B|81| M: [You] [mean] [to say] [what] ? 
A|82| B: Uh-huh . If [it's] _like_ [, [you] [know] ,] [really a] [, [you] [know] ,] [a] lower paying [job] [, [you] [know] _,] where_ _in_ [a] small town [you don't] obviously [you don't] need as [much] as far as [to] [, [you] [know] ,] [to] live . 
B|83| M: [You] . 
A|84| B: Uh-huh . 
B|85| M: _It's not_ [really a] _problem_ [, I don't have any] problems . 
A|86| B: Uh , at [this] [point] . 
B|87| M: [Well] [I] _hate_ [to say] [it _,] but_ ... 
A|88| B: _Oh ,_ [That] didn't _, uh ,_ 
B|89| M: [I'm] [not] sure [what] _I'm doing_ . 
A|90| B: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [You] [can] only _get [out_ _in] [the_ first] 2 rounds . 
A|92| B: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [What about] [the] [cat] ? 
A|94| B: _Well _,_ my_ dad wants _me_ [to] go _back_ . [So] . 
B|95| M: [And] _they just_ watch [, uh ,] movies 
A|96| B: Uh , _a lot of_ _I guess_ [is] . 
B|97| M: _I'll_ [see] [you] _later_ . 
A|98| B: Wow . 
B|99| M: [I'm] [not] _really [,_ I'm ,] 
A|100| B: Uh-huh _. Right ._ 
B|101| M:  ... _That's_ [a] [good] _thing ._ 
A|102| B: See , _so_ , plastic [, it's] _all_ [out] [of] plastic . 
B|103| M: [I'm] sure [it's] fine . 
A|104| B: _Um_ . 
B|105| M: _That's_ [all _of] the_ [good] stuff 
A|106| B: [I'm] [trying to] because [you have a] [, [you] have] one funny vowel [that's] probably _going to_ drive [the] T [I] [people] crazy . 
B|107| M: [You know _,] um [,_ the] [school] _is _just_ a_ bunch _of people_ [with] [a lot of] experience [and] experience . 
A|108| B: Have , [have you] _been_ [out] [of the] country ? 
B|109| M: [Oh [,] uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|110| B: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: We'll [be] [back] 
A|112| B: [So] [that] has put [a] crimp [in] _my_ every activity [other] [than] diapers [and] laundry , [I'll] tell [you] 
B|113| M: _I don't think_ _so [._ Right _.] It_ . Is . N 
A|114| B: [Yeah] . 
B|115| M: [And] _we used_ [the] same [kind of] paper towels 
A|116| B: [and] [I'm just] [really] [not] interested [in] [all] [that .] 
B|117| M: [Oh , I'm] sure [. You] _like to_ 
A|118| B: _So ,_ five bedrooms [and] two living , two family 
B|119| M: Ohh [, my] [bad] . 
A|120| B: [Yeah] . 
B|121| M: They _have been_ known [to] steal [your] food . 
A|122| B: [yeah] [, yeah] [it _,] it_ [really] [is [,] uh [,] but] , gee , [this [is] ,] [of] [all] [the] topics [I have] had [, [I'm] doing] [this] [thing] , [this is] [kind [of] the] strangest one . 
B|123| M: _Oh , I_ thought [the] car _was _just_ a_ battery . 
A|124| B: [It] [is] [. It] [really] [is] . 
B|125| M: Perem's [not] [that] [bad] 
A|126| B: [Yeah] . 
B|127| M: [I'm just] kidding 
A|128| B: _Well ,_ [we] live [, uh ,] [pretty] close , [to] [the] Mesquite Golf Course . 
B|129| M: [Yeah [,] but] [it's] [not a] _problem_ 
A|130| B: [I think it's] still [the] New York Yankees [, [you] [know] ,] 
B|131| M: [You] [pay] [a] ton [of] property _tax ._ 
A|132| B: [And] [I don't think] [that] , [that] rehabilitation [is] effective . 
B|133| M: [I] [do .] 
A|134| B: [that] [is just] [really] neat . [Because] [I] , 
B|135| M: [It's] [going to be] [a] fire . 
A|136| B: [and] _then_ [we] subbed [it] [out] , [so] , we've [been] _here_ [a] little over six years now . [And] [uh ,] [have] [really] enjoyed [it] because [we] built [what] [we] wanted _to [have_ to] live [in] . 
B|137| M: Uhhh ... [so] _you've_ _never_ heard [of] [it] ? 
A|138| B: There's [just] too many [people] . Uh-huh . [That's] _right ._ Not enough [people] want [to _do] that_ [to] , [for] [, uh ,] because [of a] service [that] [they] _could_ provide . 
B|139| M:  
A|140| B: [Oh [,] that's] _right ._ [I] work [for] [a] law firm 
B|141| M: [No [,] it's] [not] . 
A|142| B: [yeah] 
B|143| M: [Yeah] [but] [it's] [not] [the] same . 
A|144| B: [Yeah] . Uh-huh . 
B|145| M: _I think they_ [do [,] [and] it's] [a] [good] _thing ._ 
A|146| B: [But] [they] selectively culled _those_ litters _, I mean ,_ [for] many hundreds [of] years [and] _since_ [it] slept [in the] castle [with] its master _, I mean_ [it] had _, it_ had [to be] [of a] disposition [to] [make] [it [,] [you] [know] ,] an animal _you could_ keep [around] [that] closely . [But] [they] [would] go through [all] [the] litters [and] destroy [the] puppies [if] [they] _were_ anything [other] [than] perfect . Now [, [you] [know] ,] [that] seems _like a_ cruel [thing] [to do .] 
B|147| M: [I think] 
A|148| B: [Oh] _no_ . 
B|149| M: [So [,] uh [,] [if] [you] don't] _feel_ [you could] [do that] [then] ... 
A|150| B: [But] [it] served our needs . Uh , [later] on his reports [, the] reports [that] he studied showed [that] [, uh ,] Nissan [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in the] [in the] class [that] [we] _were_ looking [for] . [And] [that] [, and] I'd rather [have a] Maxima [than] [a] Cadillac . [I] [really] [would .] [It's not] necessarily prestige , 
B|151| M: She's [not] [going [to] [have] any] _of those_ . 
A|152| B: Where does [your] friend go [to] [to] recycle ? 
B|153| M: [There] _are_ [no] buildings . 
A|154| B: [Yeah [,] yeah .] 
B|155| M: My [dog] [is] [so] beautiful . 
A|156| B: [So [,] _I] guess_ [the] [problem] [is] [the] [, the] [thing] [to do] [is] [to] try [to] [, uh ,] [to] [get] _some_ [kind of] motivation [to] _learn_ [and] , 
B|157| M: [right .] _are_ [you] [a] girl ? 
A|158| B: [Oh [,] that's] great . 
B|159| M: [I've] [been] [around] [since] [the] beginning . 
A|160| B: Uh-huh [. Right .] 
B|161| M: [What] [is] [this] ? 
A|162| B: [But] , [then] [, [you] [know] [,] [I] think] [that] , [that] _some_ murderers [don't] [really] warrant capital punishment [. You know ,] [just] , [like] , [for] example [, uh [,] [you] [know] [,] you] hear [about] cases _where_ women [have] killed their husbands [who] abused [them] 
B|163| M: [I'll] [be] _here ._ 
A|164| B: [Oh ,] [that] sounds [nice] . [I] [like] bluegrass , too . 
B|165| M: [Oh [,] yeah .] [What] [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|166| B: [Right .] 
B|167| M:  ... 
A|168| B: [Yeah _,] he's_ [a pretty] [nice] guy . 
B|169| M: Theylol 
A|170| B: [so .] [I] named her Rosebud [, and] [, uh ,] [a] friend [of] mine said , she , [that] she [this] friend [of] mine grew up on [a] farm [and] said [that] she had [, uh ,] [a] pet cow named Rosebud [and] she said there's [a lot of] longevity [in] [that] name , said [my] cow lived seventeen years 
B|171| M: Did _you learn_ [about] [the] Utah Jazz ? 
A|172| B: _I know_ [they] lost [, yeah] , [to] Washington [and] Philadelphia . 
B|173| M: [It's] [a] [bit] . 
A|174| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh , 
B|175| M: [I mean , they] _are_ [, but] [they're] [not] [like a] normal [person .] 
A|176| B: Now [, the] [, the] [, and] [that's] [with] [, uh [,] [you] [have] [to] have] [, uh ,] oh , [a] police investigation [, [you] [have] to] , [have] references , 
B|177| M:  
A|178| B: _Oh ._ 
B|179| M: [It] 
A|180| B: [and] [that] [would] upset [a lot [of] people] too , because [they just] want [to] [get] on , 
B|181| M:  
A|182| B: _Oh ._ 
B|183| M: Ah , okay . 
A|184| B: [and] [what] [we used] [to do] [was just] put [, um ,] newspaper on [the] bottom [and] [then] put [cat] litter [and] [then] [I would] [just] take _the whole_ [thing] [to] [the] garbage [can] [and] dump _the whole_ [thing .] 
B|185| M: [Oh] ok . Hmmm [I guess] . 
A|186| B: [Because] , 
B|187| M: How [do] [you know] ? 
A|188| B: when [they] rollback an hour . 
B|189| M: You're [not] ? 
A|190| B: [so] , 
B|191| M: [There were] [some] [kids] [there [,] where] [were] [you] ? 
A|192| B: [But] , [like] [I] said [, if] [, if] someone [is [,] [is] just] pathologically [going to] murder [people] [no] matter [what] [then] [I think they] [should] [be] eliminated from society . 
B|193| M: [Oh [,] he's] [in] Dallas [for] [the whole] [week] . 
A|194| B: _Oh ._ 
B|195| M: [Oh .] Alright . 
A|196| B: _Well ,_ when [you] start early [, [I] guess] , 
B|197| M: [I'm] 
A|198| B: [Yeah] . [I'm [,] I'm] ambivalent [about] [it] because [, um [,] uh ,] well [it] [is] very frightening [and] scary . [I have] [no] perspective on _how_ [it] relates [to] [other] diseases [, and] [, uh _,] I mean_ whether , 
B|199| M: [I'm] sorry [, but] [how] [do] [you] [think they] [do that] ? 
A|200| B: [Right] _, it_ requires [a lot of] effort [to] , [to] , [to [do] that] sort [of] [thing .] 
B|201| M:  
A|202| B: [Yeah] . 
B|203| M: i , i , i . 
A|204| B: [yeah] , fluid resistance . 
B|205| M: [I think] [you're] [right .] 
A|206| B: Uh-huh [. Right .] 
B|207| M: I'ma 
A|208| B: [it's] [just] north [of] _me_ [here .] 
B|209| M: [Well [, I] mean , they] [do] [have] paper bags [in] [them .] 
A|210| B: [Yeah _,] it_ gets [kind of] [, I] , [we used] [to have] one [of those] little caves [you] [can] go [back] [in] [get out] [of the] rain . 
B|211| M: When [did] [you] [first] move [to] Texas ? 
A|212| B: Uh-huh . 
B|213| M: [Yes] 
A|214| B: He says [yeah] [, but] [then] [I] wouldn't [have you] [, I] go [, yeah] [, but] [then] [you] [would] [have [a] lot of] money 
B|215| M: [Well [,] [it] [was] a] [good] trade . 
A|216| B: [Yeah [,] [you] learn] [the] [, [you] [know] [,] the] hard [way] [, you] [hate] paying [all] [that] interest [and] [I've] [never] [been] one [to] itemize on [my] income , [tax] [and] [never] had enough [to] itemize [and] [so] [it's] [just a] big chunk [of] money [and] [you] realize [that] [you're] [not] buying anything on sale [your] paying , [so] [much] [more] [for] [that] item , because [you've] [got] finance charge [and] [the] cost [of] having [that] card every year which [is] [what] , forty dollars sometimes [just] [to have] [the] card . 
B|217| M: What's wrong [with] being [a] fan [of the] [school] ? 
A|218| B: [Yeah ,] well when [, uh [,] my] [, my] doggie [, uh ,] [that] [we] [have] now [, uh ,] she's , she's mostly Golden Retriever . 
B|219| M: They _are_ [the] best ! 
A|220| B: [And] [you're] [in] Minneapolis , 
B|221| M: [No ,] [you're] [just] 
A|222| B: Uh-huh [. Right .] 
B|223| M: [I've] [been] [doing] [it .] 
A|224| B: Daddy , Daddy came [home] [and] found her playing [with] [the] telephone [that I] had unplugged 
B|225| M: My house [is] slab . 
A|226| B: [but] [they] _won_ [, the] Mets _won_ . 
B|227| M: What's [that] ? 
A|228| B: Strictly [your] skill . 
B|229| M: [You] [and] [me] both brother . 
A|230| B: [Yeah ,] well , [that] [makes] [a] [really] big difference . [But] [, but] , still [it's] [just] as hard as having , [that] ,
