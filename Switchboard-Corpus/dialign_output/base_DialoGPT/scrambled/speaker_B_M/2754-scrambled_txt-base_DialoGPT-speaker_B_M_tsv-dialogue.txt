Then [you] [don't] _really_ [have] [to] [have] _much_ maintenance involved . 
B|69| M: [It's] okay . 
A|70| B: [It's] _really_ kind [of] curious [to] watch _this_ _thing_ occur . 
B|71| M: [Are you] [from] Missouri ? 
A|72| B: Um , usually [, uh ,] word processing something , um , such as , oh , forms [for] [things] [, uh ,] 
B|73| M: [It's] [not] [that] expensive . 
A|74| B: And progressive tax _, I think [,_ uh ,] does [not] give [people] incentive [to] make _more_ _money_ _, and_ [what] [I] [mean] by [that] , [the] _more_ income [you] make , [the] _more_ tax [you] pay . 
B|75| M: Pudding [, I] made pudding [for] breakfast . 
A|76| B: they're , they're , getting old now _, and_ _it's_ time [to] [get] rid [of] [them] .

A|78| B: [Yeah] . 
B|79| M: [I] . 
A|80| B: [We] _had _a_ lot_ [of] bank robberies [and] different , _lot_ [of] break ins [and] _stuff_ _. I [know_ ,] like [a] week or [so] ago [, [I] live in] [a] , [in] [a] town [house] , which [is] [, you] [know ,] [it's a] pretty nice neighborhood [and] _this_ lady [was] going [to] work , she came home [and] everything [in] her [house] [was] total gone , light fixtures , everything . And nobody thought any different , [they] [just] thought she [was] moving . It [was a] moving man pulled right up [to] her [house] , broke [in] [and] stole everything she owned 
B|81| M: That's 
A|82| B: [Yeah ,] [it] [is] tough . [It's] [, and] [I don't know] who's [even] proposing [it] , or , or _how_ [they] plan _on_ implementing [it] , if [they] [do] . 
B|83| M:  
A|84| B: Forty-two cents out [of] every dollar [I] make goes [to the] government [, and] [then] [they] charge me sales tax [and] [they] charge me gasoline taxes , 
B|85| M: uhuhuh uhuhuh 
A|86| B: after [that] , if [you] asked me [that] [I] wouldn't [have] [been] able [to] tell [you] if [that] [was] football or baseball . 
B|87| M: [I know] [it's a] bichon . 
A|88| B: Those milk cartons take up [so] _much_ room . 
B|89| M: Because [, I think [,] a lot] [people] [, uh ,] depends [on] [how] [much] [money] [I have] 
A|90| B: Very frustrating . [Uh] _, but_ again [I've been] dealing [with] large files both data [and [,] and] otherwise . [Uh] , [that] [was a] engineering spec [on] B two . _You_ come here [with] [the] B level [of] specs ? 
B|91| M: _I'm_ gonna [go] [with a] [yes] . 
A|92| B: And [so] [it's] , [in] terms [of] cost [and [,] [and] [,] and] size [and] [so] forth , [it] [, uh ,] [the] [you] [know ,] housing there [is] extremely affordable [, [and] [,] uh ,] compared [to] other parts [of the] country [, you] [know ,] let's _say_ compared [to] Maryland [that] same [house] here would probably cost three-quarters [of] [a] million dollars 
B|93| M: _I'm_ sorry [, but] _I'm not_ [a] doctor . 
A|94| B: Really ? 
B|95| M: [I] am [so] sorry . 
A|96| B: For _one_ person ? 
B|97| M: [I [think] the] only [thing] [I] [can] [say] [is] [that] _I'm_ [really] looking forward [to] [this] 
A|98| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh .
