A|50| B: [I think] [so] . 
B|51| M:  ... [Uh] huh . 
A|52| B: _he_ _was_ an , an assistant district attorney [in] Chicago at [, uh _,] and_ _while_ _he_ _was_ writing [the] book _, and_ [, uh ,] my sister-in-law lives [in] Chicago _, and_ she had , before [it] actually [got] big , she sent me [this] book saying , [you] might [like this] , [this] guy [is] , [you] _know_ , [from] here . 
B|53| M: He . 
A|54| B: Oh [, yeah .] [You] bet [you] . [You] bet [you] . [You] _know how_ [they] came up with [the] retriever , _don't_ [you] , [the] Golden ? 
B|55| M: [I'm] gonna [go] [and] _get_ _some_ food [and] drink . 
A|56| B: [You] too , dear . 
B|57| M: We _should_ _just_ _go to the_ end [of the] world . 
A|58| B: [and] one [of the] fish _was_ missing [and] [they] couldn't find [it] anyplace _, they_ couldn't figure out [what] had happened [and] then [they] found [it] fried on , [the] radiator behind . 
B|59| M: [You] . 
A|60| B: Uh-huh [, yeah .] [Uh] _, I_ , um _, I_ used [to] _, uh , I_ used [to] weigh [, uh ,] two hundred fifteen pounds _, and_ now [I] weigh only [about] one , [about] one seventy-five . Um , [so] [I] drastically had [to] change [the] way [I] ate when [I] , when [I] first moved _to college_ _, and_ _, uh , I_ had started weight lifting quite regularly _, and_ [so] [I] [got] my weight down _, _and_ it's_ kind [of] easy [for] me [to] forget [about] [it] now , because [, uh ,] [you] _know_ , when _I'm not_ fat [like] [I] used [to] _be_ _I don't_ worry [about] [it] 
B|61| M: _I would be_ surprised [if] [they] didn't .

A|66| B: Uh-huh . 
B|67| M: Do [they] [have] streets ? 
A|68| B: Yes [it is] . [It's] [a] tough , tough question . It [really] [is] . [I] suspect [I would be] [, uh ,] [you] [know] , [a lot] more favor [of] [it] [if] , [you] [know] , one [of] my children were , [you] [know] , brutally killed , or something [like] _that ._ Like [I] say _, [I_ think] [it] depends on [how] personally affected , [you] [know] , [you] might [be] [by] [it .] 
B|69| M: [I mean _,] it_ [really] helps . 
A|70| B: [Yeah [,] and] [, and] [, uh ,] upgraded [it] [and] put things [in] there [and] dibbled [and] dabbled [and] now , now _it's_ , now _it's a_ fast machine 
B|71| M: [I] 
A|72| B: [and] [if] _we_ had something _to do_ before [they] [get] [to] [be] full-blown adult criminals [, and] _I'm not_ talking [about] necessarily _in _the_ school_ system [, _I'm] not_ [sure] [that] _the school_ system [should] [be] [the] agent [of] all [the] social action . 
B|73| M: well [, they] [do] [have] [the best] voice [of] any _student_ [in the] history [of [the] school] _, if_ [that] counts . 
A|74| B: [Uh] [So [,] they] [, they] [, uh ,] _don't_ [have] too many facilities [it] seems [for] their personal items . Very limited space waste 
B|75| M: Just stop . 
A|76| B: Well [, uh [,] uh] [about the] same [I] dress [for] [school] . [I] _, uh , I_ am [a] graduate [student] [so] _, _I_ don't_ _have to_ worry too much [about] [, uh [,] what] [I] wear too much [of [the] time] . Which [is] [nice] . 
B|77| M: [It's] _been_ [a] [while] since [I've] seen [the] Giants [, but] [I think] they're doing alright . 
A|78| B: [Uh] [, it] starts with [a] K . 
B|79| M: [But] [, uh , I] [have to] [get] rid [of] [them] . 
A|80| B: [Yeah ,] right . 
B|81| M: [I think] [you] [mean] ... [I don't] _know ._ 
A|82| B: Uh-huh . 
B|83| M: Ya [but] [it's a] store [and it's] [not] [like] [a] mall 
A|84| B: Oh , my God , [the] poor [woman] . 
B|85| M:  ... [and we] [have] [a] deal . 
A|86| B: Oh , [you] [get] [that] stuff [in the] mail all [the time] . 
B|87| M: What [are] [you] trying [to do] ? 
A|88| B: Did [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
B|89| M: [I think] [they] [would be] . 
A|90| B: [Yeah] . 
B|91| M: [I don't] understand , [are] [you] [in the] room ? 
A|92| B: [Right .] 
B|93| M: [It's] [the] deer . 
A|94| B: [but] we're going [to] ignore [it] 
B|95| M: [I don't] [think] [you] [can] [do] [that .] 
A|96| B: And [it's] kind [of] split between C M U [and] [, and] , [you] [know] , [the] employee . 
B|97| M: Uhm . Hmm . 
A|98| B: [I] guess [it's] [just] [that] maybe people [are] , [you] [know] , upset at court , [you] [know .] If [it] [was] [, if] [it] [was] [a] , [a] family member [of] theirs , though [that] [was] innocent [and] , then they'd want [to] [be] on [that] jury . 
B|99| M: [So] [he] [can] [go [to] college] . 
A|100| B: [Uh] , that's great . 
B|101| M: We [do] . 
A|102| B: [I think] [that] [should] [be] left up [to] people who [have] [some] knowledge [in the] subject [and] more knowledge than [a] jury [would] [have] . you're talking [about] , [the] person's already [been] found guilty , right 
B|103| M: self . 
A|104| B: Well [, I] [do] [think] with working parents [it is] [, [I] mean ,] there [are] [some] real issues here . Um , [that] [I think] , um , 
B|105| M: Uhhuh 
A|106| B: [Yeah] . 
B|107| M: [How] [do] [they] [do] [that ?] 
A|108| B: [So ,] [we] , [we] rely pretty , pretty heavily [, [I] think] , on [a] combination [of the] , [of the] two . [I] also [, uh ,] use [, uh ,] NEWSWEEK magazine . [Uh] , 
B|109| M: [I'm not] [a] fan [of] [that] song .
