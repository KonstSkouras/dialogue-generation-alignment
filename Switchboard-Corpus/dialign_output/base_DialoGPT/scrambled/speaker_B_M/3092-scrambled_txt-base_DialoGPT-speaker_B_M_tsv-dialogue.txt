A|70| B: Uh , almost an addition [, uh ,] _and_ , _and_ , _and_ we could equate or relate relay well [to] some [of the] newspaper _and_ television articles [about the] fact [that] [people] where having _this_ _problem_ _in_ , _in_ unhooking , uncoupling _from the_ events , _and_ _going_ _on_ _with_ their [. [So] ,] 
B|71| M: [Huh] ? [Where do you] work ? 
A|72| B: [Oh .] 
B|73| M: Not sure [if] you're aware [, but] [the] federal prison system [is a] federal crime .

A|90| B: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: _I'm_ sorry [, but] [what] [is] [the] point [of] [this] ? 
A|92| B: [I think] [it's] real important [that] [you] [have a] place [that] , first [of] all parents [have [a] lot of] input into _and_ [that] _they're_ always welcome _and_ [that they] [have [a] lot of] activities where parents come _in_ during [the] day _and_ [that] at any time [you can] drop _in_ . [And] we had [a] [really] wonderful arrangement [, [uh ,] I'm] [with the] university actually 
B|93| M: [He] [has] no money . 
A|94| B: Bye , now . 
B|95| M: [No .] She's [not] [in] my room .

A|98| B: Do your own thing [. Yeah .] 
B|99| M: [I] can't _wait_ 
A|100| B: Uh-huh . 
B|101| M: [I'm] [so] sorry 
A|102| B: [Oh ,] [is] [she] still [there] ? 
B|103| M: This . 
A|104| B: [Yeah .] Anyway , um [, I] guess [it's] , 
B|105| M: [He] nods [and] puts his hands [on] his hips . [I'm] fine . 
A|106| B: [Well] we always [wait] until we [can] rent them , [you] know 
B|107| M: A little . 
A|108| B: Um , [so] [that's [,] that] kind [of] helps out [in] terms [of] , [you] know , keeping up-to-date [with] contacts [in] industry . 
B|109| M: They're [not] [, they're] [just] [big] [and] strong . 
A|110| B: Sharon , Pennsylvania's up [there] . 
B|111| M:  
A|112| B: Uh-huh .
