B|63| M: I'll _buy_ [it] . 
A|64| B: Uh-huh [. I] _was_ [just] saying [that] way , [what] they're saying [is] [that] [they] _can't_ _get_ _people_ [to] turn themselves _in_ then . And _so_ _, we_ _have to_ go through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's guilty . 
B|65| M: [Uh [,] I'm] sorry ? 
A|66| B: _Right_ . That's true . _Yeah [,_ well] , [it] , [it] [, you [know] [,] you] _get_ certain circumstances where [you] hear [about] these _people_ [that] [have] [, you [know] ,] stolen kids [and [,] you [know] ,] done terrible things [to] them [and] killed them [and [,] you [know] ,] [that] sort _of_ thing , 
B|67| M: [Right _,] yeah_ 
A|68| B: And [, [and] ,] incorporating [, you [know] ,] reusable materials into [your] [, uh [,] you [know] ,] [your] assembly line into [your] actual scheme _of_ product operations [is] [is] [the] only way [to] [really] [do] [it] _on a_ , _on a_ broad scale . 
B|69| M: _You_ [have _to] [be_ a] murderer [to] _have a_ choice . 
A|70| B: Uh-huh .

A|84| B: If [you] compare [the] , [like] [the] _people_ [that] [could] [have] , [that] [could] [have] sent their kids [to] private schools [and] [the] _people_ [that] [, you [know] ,] [the] _people_ [that] [, uh ,] [did] send their kids [to] private schools . 
B|85| M: Why ? 
A|86| B: Okay , thank [you] . Bye-bye 
B|87| M: [I'm] [in the] same boat . 
A|88| B: Even if , if they're _even_ [in] [that] long . Or [they] appeal [, and] then [they] _get_ an appeal [that] says [it] _was_ [, you [know] ,] an unjust amount _of_ time , an extraordinary long length , or something . 
B|89| M:  ... [what] [was] [the] plan ? 
A|90| B: [and [,] uh ,] then after [that] [, I] , my sister lives [in] Turkey _, so_ when [I] [was] [like] fourteen , fifteen [, I] went [, I] went [to] Turkey . 
B|91| M: [Yeah [,] uh [,] I'm] sorry . 
A|92| B: [I mean] [they] [they] [I] believe if [I'm] correct [I] believe [they] permitted their carrying concealed weapons . 
B|93| M: [I don't] _have [a_ lot of] sugar . 
A|94| B: [yeah [,] you know .] [So] there's [, you [know] ,] there's some things [I think] [we] [can] [we] [, you know] [we] _can't_ avoid [for] health purposes [and] some things [that] [we] [just] [need] [to] [like] [, you [know] ,] [this] [is] [not] [in] my control . 
B|95| M: You're [right .] 
A|96| B: [You] 
B|97| M: [It's] [not] [a] scam [, it's a] deal 
A|98| B: [Right] . 
B|99| M: [So] ... [we] subbed [on a lot [of] people] who didn't [even] [get] [a] chance [to make] [a] decision .

B|101| M: [I [know] .] They should [have] [been] [more] concerned [about] [the] smogginess [of the] air [in the] area . 
A|102| B: [Uh [,] and] occasionally [what] we'll each [do] depending [on] whoever [is] driving [is] [have] [the] newspaper sort [of] [on] our lap [on] [the] way [in] , [in the] car _, so_ [we] [have] [the] advantage [of] being able [to] [, uh ,] read [and] drive although [there] seems [to be] , _from_ [what] _I've seen_ [on] [the] freeway recently [that] [a] fair number [of people] are reading [and] driving 
B|103| M: They [were] [good] 
A|104| B: [I] remember seeing _that ._ 
B|105| M: [No ,] 
A|106| B: That [was] [, uh ,] [that] [was] [a lot of] fun .

A|108| B: Have [you] [seen] [, uh ,] CANINE . [The] movie , oh , 
B|109| M: Goodbye . 
A|110| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|112| B: This [is] bred [for] [, and] [they] had [to] go through [and] destroy [a] , [for a] while [there] , [about] seventy-five percent [of] their puppies [that] [they] bred . 
B|113| M: What [about] camping ? 
A|114| B: [I] [was] born [in] L A [so [I] know what you're talking about .] In L A [, it's] pretty bad .
