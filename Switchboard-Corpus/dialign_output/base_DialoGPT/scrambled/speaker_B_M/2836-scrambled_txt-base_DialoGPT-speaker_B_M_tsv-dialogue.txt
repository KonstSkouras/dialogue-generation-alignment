A|66| B: Uh-huh . [No] . Really ? 
B|67| M: How _many_ [of] [them] [were] students ? 
A|68| B: Right . Then [you can] [just] sort [of] [have] pictures [to] go along [with] [it] or something [, because] [really] , [I've] thought lately , there's nothing new [in the] TIME MAGAZINE . 
B|69| M: _Yeah [,_ the] number [is] [a] [bit] high . 
A|70| B: [and I] find [that] [I] [can] often [, _you] know ,_ often [, uh ,] [when] [I] get around [to] doing [it] , then _I [,_ I] feel better [when] [I] get back [to] work 
B|71| M: [So] [is] English 
A|72| B: Over [the] uncooked rice ?

B|75| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|76| B: [Uh [,] it] , there's some trees [like] [the] oaks , [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] pretty hardy . There's , nothing bothers [them .] Their leaves [are] still green [, and] some [of] [the] other oaks . There [are] _a few_ oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . Um [, what] [I] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples , [that] [the] leaves [are] [just] dead [, the] dogwoods still [look] , still [look] [, _you] know ,_ they got [, uh ,] [bit] _on the_ ends [of] [the] leaves _a little_ [bit] [, but] they still [look] pretty [good] . 
B|77| M: You [know .] [I'm] just'bout _that ._ com . 
A|78| B: Uh-huh .

A|90| B: Right . There [has] [to be] [, uh _,] a_ reuse _for_ [it [.] I mean ,] [that's] [why] they recycle . The one [I think] [is] [the] most [interesting] [is] [with] [the] recycled bottles [and] all [that [,] uh [,] the] industry seems [to be] doing [with] [the] recycled polymers . [Uh ,] everything from [, uh ,] waste baskets [to] carpet _to the_ no stick [, [I] mean] [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet
