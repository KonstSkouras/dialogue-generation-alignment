B|71| M: [I'm not sure] [you know] [what] [the] word opinion means . 
A|72| B: [I] [can] [I] [can] _just_ [do] [it] 
B|73| M: How [about] [you] ? 
A|74| B: [Yeah] . 
B|75| M: [I] [have] [, I'm] [just] saying [that's] [what] [I've] seen [a lot] . 
A|76| B: [We] [just] try [not] [to] pay any more _in_ than [we] [have to] [, uh [,] we] pay _in_ [a] substantial amount . [Uh] , 
B|77| M:  . 
A|78| B: Right . They shouldn't allow an appeal . 
B|79| M: [I] am [. I] am . 
A|80| B: Uh-huh . 
B|81| M: [I think] [the] fact [that] [they] were so sad [when] [they] were kicked _out of the_ country [was a] [good] example . 
A|82| B: Ten [, I] [was] [just] _in_ [the] middle [of] watching [it] . 
B|83| M: [I] [like to] [go] outside 
A|84| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . [Yeah] . 
B|85| M: [I] [know] . [I'm] [just] saying .

A|88| B: [Yeah] . 
B|89| M: [I'm not sure] [about] 
A|90| B: [Oh ,] yeah . 
B|91| M: [That's] [the] joke . 
A|92| B: My brother [had] fish [when] [I] [was a] kid [I] remember [that] , [and] _one of_ his fish jumped [out of the] _, um ,_ gosh , [what] _do you_ call [it ,] fish tank . And fried itself , on [the] radiator behind [the] dresser . I'll [never] forget [that] because [I] remember [my] brother , he came home [and] he counted [the] fish 
B|93| M: Where [do you] _live_ ? 
A|94| B: Anyway [, I] dealt [with] two or three [kids] today [that] [are going to] end up where somebody [has] , making [a] decision [what] [to do] [with] them . 
B|95| M: [I] [would] [totally] [buy] [one of] those 
A|96| B: [and] , 
B|97| M: [I] [want to] [go to] Argentina 
A|98| B: [Yeah ,] 
B|99| M: [Oh [,] well [,] um , I] [like _to] live_ [my] life . 
A|100| B: [No ,] it's [not] realistic . 
B|101| M: They're so cute ! 
A|102| B: Uh-huh . 
B|103| M: [work] 
A|104| B: They almost always [get] thrown right back [out] again [, but [they] _have to] have_ every single appeal made open [to] them . 
B|105| M: [We] _have to have a_ [good] story [to [the] people] [of] Iceland . 
A|106| B: [Oh ,] close [to] five minutes [, I] believe . 
B|107| M: [The] [, uh ,] foreground ? 
A|108| B: [Uh] , [that] happens [to] be [my] specialty for [that] family [. I] [do] [other] things very [well ,] 
B|109| M: _I'd_ love [to] [see] [a] picture [of a] glass window . 
A|110| B: Then [I think] [they] ought [to [have] to] pay something [out of] their own pocket . 
B|111| M: [I'm] [just] curious [as] [to] [what] [the] [real] reason [is .] 
A|112| B: But [if] [I] [had] [the] little red C R X [, I] guess [the] interior [would] [have to] be black leather [and] [I'd] [have [to] live] [with] [that] . And [if] [I] got [the] C R X [it] [would] [have to have a] [real] [good] sound system _in_ [it] because [I'd] [want] [that] too . 
B|113| M: so , [you're] saying [, you] [could] [have] [the] entire [thing] [done] [in] 5 years ? 
A|114| B: [I'm a] nurse [and] [I] [work] ,
