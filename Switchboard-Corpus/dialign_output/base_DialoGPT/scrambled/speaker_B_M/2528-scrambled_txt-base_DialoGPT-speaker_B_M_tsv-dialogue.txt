A|86| B: _But_ , yeah , [not] [my] [a lot] , *sp ? by [and] [then] somebody else lost , maybe [it] [was] _the other_ New York team which [is the] Yankees , 
B|87| M: [I think] [I'm] [going [to] [go] and] see [, what] , one , _two_ 
A|88| B: Um .

A|90| B: [Well ,] she does [not] [have] [it] , [but] , she [is] [like] , on [the] verge [of] [it] or , something . 
B|91| M: [I'm] [sorry] 
A|92| B: [but] your cousin could [have a] baseball team with twelve [kids] 
B|93| M: Did [you] learn [that] ? 
A|94| B: [Oh] , okay . [I don't] [think] [I] really [know [that] .] 
B|95| M: What [if] [the] girl [is] [a] drug dealer ? 
A|96| B: So [I] [do] admire [that] , [but] [I] haven't really [put] [, uh ,] too much energy into [it .] Course [we] [have] [two] [little] [kids] [that] [are] [two] [and] three years old 
B|97| M: Where's [the other] ? 
A|98| B: [and] [that] [was] [we] bought [a] station wagon . [We] wanted [an] economical car [to] operate , 
B|99| M: [But] [you] can't make [a] choice [to] participate . 
A|100| B: Right , [the] first appeal [is] automatic , [so] [that] delays [it] [for [a] few] years [just] right off [the] bat . 
B|101| M: [Yeah [,] I'm] [sorry] . 
A|102| B: Uh-huh .
