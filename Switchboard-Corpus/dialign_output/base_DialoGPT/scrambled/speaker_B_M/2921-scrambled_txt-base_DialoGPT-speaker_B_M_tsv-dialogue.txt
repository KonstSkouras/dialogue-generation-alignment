B|21| M: Uhhh _, uh _, I_ didn't_ _think_ [that] [the] EPUB _was_ [a] _thing_ yet . 
A|22| B: Right . 
B|23| M: _You_ _are_ _going_ _on _the_ same_ day _, if_ [you] _are_ _in the_ exact _same_ place . 
A|24| B: [Yeah _.] I_ [, uh , I] guess [you can] get [an] earlier harvest by _doing_ _that ,_ 
B|25| M: Did [you] hear [the] Richardson ? 
A|26| B: _That's_ _too_ bad _, because_ _I'm_ probably _not_ [going] [to] stop eating [it] 
B|27| M: [I] mean _, I know_ I'd [be] 
A|28| B: [But ,] _with_ [the] three children _um_ , orthopedic care _, um_ , _not_ orthopedic , orthodontic care , 
B|29| M: Why [do] [you] _think_ ? 
A|30| B: Right [. [Well ,] [you] can] wait till [you] graduate _and_ you'll _have_ plenty _of_ _money_ [, [you] can] buy whatever [you] want . 
B|31| M: Some _people _,_ we_ call [it] _a family_ . 
A|32| B: _Yeah ,_ [it] really [does] . 
B|33| M: _I think_ . 
A|34| B: _It_ _is_ _, it's_ real nice . 
B|35| M: _It's_ [not] . 
A|36| B: _Uh _,_ the_ worst city [in the] , [in the] world _is_ actually [, uh ,] Mexico City . 
B|37| M: [Yeah _, I] know ,_ [I'm] _saying_ [that they're] expensive [because] [of] their origins . 
A|38| B: [Yeah .] 
B|39| M: Ugh . [Uh [,] _you] _got_ a_ couple [of] [them] , _huh_ ? 
A|40| B: [they] devoured [it] [that] quickly . 
B|41| M: [Yeah ,] _he's_ dead . 
A|42| B: _Oh_ _, well ,_ _still_ _that's_ [a] _, you know _,_ that's_ [a] _good_ chunk [of] kids . 
B|43| M: [I] _would_ [like] [to] _know that_ [too] 
A|44| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah _.] I think_ [going] [to] [the] schools [would] [be] [the] easiest _for_ [them] . 
B|45| M: _You_ 
A|46| B: [Yeah .] 
B|47| M: _I have_ _no_ idea what _you're_ talking [about] 
A|48| B: Right . 
B|49| M: [That's] [so] sweet . 
A|50| B: _and_ [we] _all_ [know] one [another] _and_ _, and_ , [on] our one little section _of the_ street [we] _all_ [know] one [another] _and_ [know that] _we're_ [not] moving _and_ different things [like] [that] . 
B|51| M: Oooh . [Uh] . 
A|52| B: Uh-huh . Huh [, we] _don't_ , 
B|53| M: _It's_ [a] book [, so] ... 
A|54| B: _Oh_ _. [I_ have] one [of] those [. Yeah .] 
B|55| M: [I] [do] . 
A|56| B: [Well , you] [learn] [a] _lot of_ _, um_ , skills [too] _, _and_ [I_ think] [you're] _more_ receptive when [you're] younger than when [you're] older , [to] [learn] new skills , 
B|57| M: They're [still] [in the] news . 
A|58| B: _and so_ [I] learned [that] [on] there [too] _, that_ [was] , 
B|59| M: Really . yes 
A|60| B: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|61| M: He's [a] cat . 
A|62| B: Huh . 
B|63| M: [I think] [they] [do] . 
A|64| B: [Uh ,] _for_ example [, _I] was_ messing [around] _with_ [a] spreadsheet _this_ weekend _that's_ [a] third _of a_ meg [in] beta size . 
B|65| M:  , cake 
A|66| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: The vet called _her_ [, uh ,] [a] golden mix 
B|69| M: [I'm] [not] sure what's wrong [with] [it] 
A|70| B: _Oh_ _, that's_ okay . 
B|71| M: _Um_ ... [I] did [that [,] um] ... [for] [the] [money] . 
A|72| B: And [the] uncertainty [of] whether [you're] [going] _to _have_ a_ _job_ _is_ [not] as _good_ _, but_ _, the_ fact [that] [you] really [can] make major changes [in] _your_ life _and_ jobs . 
B|73| M: Ohh [, that] guy 
A|74| B: Exactly . 
B|75| M: _You_ [know] 
A|76| B: Uh-huh . 
B|77| M: [Well [,] that's] 
A|78| B: Uh-huh . 
B|79| M: [It] 
A|80| B: [You] live [in] Pennsylvania ? 
B|81| M: _No ._ _No ._ _no_ . _no_ 
A|82| B: Uh-huh . 
B|83| M: [I have] _no_ idea . 
A|84| B: And [, uh , I] read [it] _and_ really liked [it] _and_ then [about] [, that] _is_ when [it] really [got] _big_ . And [, uh [,] so] [I] , 
B|85| M: _So_ what's [the] deal _with them_ ? 
A|86| B: [it] [was] [not] gross [, I didn't] _see_ [it] _but_ [, um] , [got] [them] . 
B|87| M: _So _,_ we're_ [like] the'do'thing , [right] ? 
A|88| B: [it] , [it] [was] [around] there generally . 
B|89| M: [I [have] a] strong interest [in] learning [, and] [I'm] [not] sure what [that] means . 
A|90| B: [I know [,] I know _,] it's_ true . 
B|91| M: [I'm] sorry 
A|92| B: [It's] , [Yeah ,] 
B|93| M: [I think] [it's] just [for] [the] sake [of] [it .] 
A|94| B: Uh-huh . 
B|95| M: What's [a] coincidence ? 
A|96| B: [So [,] if] [it's] _your_ peers [and] [you're] [not] educated then , 
B|97| M: _I was in_ [a] van 
A|98| B: Uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [Uh [,] well [,] uh _, [I] don't know_ a] jury [, you know [,] because] [, uh] ... 
A|100| B: They've _been_ here probably thirty , forty _years_ . 
B|101| M:  
A|102| B: _Oh_ , [on] one hand _I see_ [that] [and] [on the] other hand [, uh _,] my_ older sister remembers when [, uh ,] at one _point_ [they] were taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [I] guess , had [a] half-life [of] , [oh] , five _years_ _if they_ sit empty [on] dry land . 
B|103| M: What [does] [it] affect [you know _,] uh , you know_ ? 
A|104| B: _Oh_ , wow . 
B|105| M:  ... [do] [you] [have] any [job] ? 
A|106| B: Farming ? 
B|107| M: [You] [know _,] I've_ seen [the] light . 
A|108| B: Two ? 
B|109| M: _there's_ [more] [of a] difference between [this] _and the_ death penalty 
A|110| B: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [I think] _he's_ [in] jail 
A|112| B: Uh-huh . 
B|113| M: [I'm] sorry [for] [your] loss . 
A|114| B: [Well , they] [are] [, they] [are] [the] ultimate dog _to have_ [around] kids [so] long as [your] kid _is_ [not] scared [of _a] big_ dog [, because] [I] had [a] retriever , actually [I] had [a] retriever Irish Setter cross . Which _is_ [a] really nice animal 
B|115| M: A [lot _of] people_ [have a] small _family_ . 
A|116| B: [Well [,] we're] Catholics _. I_ came from [a family] [of] five _. I_ had four brothers , 
B|117| M: [So [,] uh ,] how's [it] [going] ? 
A|118| B: Uh-huh . 
B|119| M: :Yeah . adays . 
A|120| B: [I was [in] the] band , yeah 
B|121| M: They're both . 
A|122| B: [Yeah .] 
B|123| M: _No_ 
A|124| B: _and so_ [they] say [, well ,] [this] _is_ [, you know [,] I] [, I don't know] _if they_ say _it's the_ first time offense or whatever _, but_ [they] give him [a] lighter sentence , thinking [he's] _not a_ habitual criminal . 
B|125| M: [You] [know] 
A|126| B: [I think] [so] . 
B|127| M: [Well [, it's] a] _thing_ [you know] . 
A|128| B: [Well ,] [it] will take [you] [a] little while _but_ you'll probably always [have a] soft spot [in] [your] heart though [for] [for] Denver . 
B|129| M: What [if they] can't afford [it] ? 
A|130| B: [No .] The only [thing] [that] [I] [, I] visited [that [,] you know ,] _is_ quite [a] tourist spot _is_ Cancun , Mexico . 
B|131| M: [I] 
A|132| B: [no] , [no] _, but [I_ have] had some times when [I've] had some _pretty_ _good_ balances [on] there [and] [, uh [, you know] [,] I] finally [, you know ,] paid [them] _all_ off [and] thought [this] _is_ [, you know ,] kind [of] nonsense . [So [,] we] [don't] [, uh ,] [have] _big_ balances [on] [them] at , _all_ now [we're] [, we're] [, you know [,] we] [, I] use [it] occasionally _but I_ pay [it] [right] off . We're ... 
B|133| M: [I know] . 
A|134| B: [and] [, uh ,] [they're] [going] [to] [the] _big_ cities . [It] makes [it] very difficult . 
B|135| M: Ummm 
A|136| B: The whole [family] [was] [so] _disappointed_ 
B|137| M: [It's] [not] [the] heat . 
A|138| B: Huh ? 
B|139| M: [It's] [not a] coincidence . 
A|140| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|141| M: [I know ,] [I'm] [a] girl [, and] yes [, I] went [to] Disney World . 
A|142| B: [But [,] uh [,] we] , 
B|143| M: [I] [would] [have] [been] [disappointed] [if] [the] cat [was] dead . 
A|144| B: _Oh_ [, that's] [not] unusual , yeah . 
B|145| M: [Well [,] the] last two [years] [have] [been] [a] ... [uh] ,... 
A|146| B: [No] [, it's] [, it's] [got] [people] singing _, but_ [it's] [it] _is_ instrumental . [But] [it's] [, it's] [got] [people] singing _but_ [it's] [got a] , [like] [a] whole bunch [of people] singing . 
B|147| M: [Yeah [,] uh [,] uh] . 
A|148| B: [Yeah .] Flexible _hours_ [are] , [are] _pretty_ important [to] me as [well] . 
B|149| M: [Oh] ? 
A|150| B: Uh-huh . 
B|151| M: What [is] [the] [point] [of] [this] ? 
A|152| B: Uh-huh . 
B|153| M:  ? 
A|154| B: Uh-huh . 
B|155| M:  
A|156| B: [So ,] 
B|157| M: High ? [No .] 
A|158| B: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|159| M: [I know] . [That's] why [I] said [it .] 
A|160| B: [Yeah .] 
B|161| M: [I have] , maybe 
A|162| B: Right . If [you] [don't] [go] [and] vote , then [, you know ,] very _good_ chance [that] [they] [, they] will [because] [a] [lot _of] the_ [people] [like] [that ,] they'll strike [a] chord [in] _something_ [, you know ,] [in] some _of the_ [people [,] that] [so] will say , _look_ [, you know ,] [this] guy's [got] everything together . 
B|163| M: [I don't] [think] [it's _the] same_ [. I think] [the] [money] [would] [go] [to] education [, _and] the_ [money] goes [to] cancer research . 
A|164| B: Yes , uh-huh . 
B|165| M: [I have] [to have] [her] eyes [tested] . 
A|166| B: Right [. I] agree [with] [that] . Because [I know] personally myself [, I've] [been] [in [the] same] [job] [for] three [years] , [it] will [be] three [years] [in] August [and] [I've] already [been] drug [tested] three times . 
B|167| M: [But] [you] [have] , [right] ? 
A|168| B: Uh-huh . 
B|169| M: 3 , 
A|170| B: [It] [was] incredible actually 
B|171| M: [You] [see] ? 
A|172| B: Right . 
B|173| M: [It's] [pretty] _much_ [all] [you] [have] . 
A|174| B: [and the] way [I was] brought _up_ [, and] [he] wants me now [, he ,] [like] [he [,] you know ,] [like] [he] wants [to] [be] best friends now 
B|175| M:  ... [and so] [it] wound [up] . 
A|176| B: [and] [you got] [to] try [to] [be] [with them] as [much] as [you can] [and] [to] [, you know ,] [like] , [thing] [is] , [is] [, [that] [,] you know ,] [like] [if] [, [if] they] [would] ever happen [to [have] a] drug problem , suppose [, that] [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] [saying] [, I] [got a] problem [you know ,] 
B|177| M: [I'm] [not] sure [, but I] [can] find [something] [that] [would] [look] [good] . 
A|178| B: [and] [it] takes [up] [your] whole space 
B|179| M: [Yeah ,] [I'm] [a big] fan [of] [this] idea . 
A|180| B: [but [I] don't [know] that] [there's] [a] real [, uh ,] 
B|181| M: [I] wonder how many [hours] [a] day [he] spends [in the] office . 
A|182| B: [Uh] [huh] . 
B|183| M: Uhhhhh [, my] husband [and I] [are] [doing] [a] wedding [in] July !

A|188| B: Uh-huh . 
B|189| M: Ah [, [I] [see] .] 
A|190| B: [Um] , most _of the_ lawyer programs [like] [, uh ,] LAW AND ORDER , [they're] [not] [on the] times [that] [I've] [got] [, that] [I've] watched [because] [I] haven't had T [got] , T V GUIDE [around] here [in] ages . 
B|191| M: [So [,] the] Triangle [is] [the] North Carolina [of the] South ?
