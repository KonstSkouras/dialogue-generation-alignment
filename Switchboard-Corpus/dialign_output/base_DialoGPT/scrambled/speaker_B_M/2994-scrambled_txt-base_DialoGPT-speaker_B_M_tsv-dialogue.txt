A|4| B: Uh-huh . 
B|5| M: _How_ many _people_ _do_ _you know_ who _don't have_ their own . 
A|6| B: That sounds _like_ [it] would hurt more . 
B|7| M: _I know_ . 
A|8| B: So [I] guess [I] can't really [I] can't say what [it] would be _like_ _to_ , uh , grow up _in a_ really oppressed region 
B|9| M: It's _been_ [a] while since [I've] _seen a_ musical . 
A|10| B: because we're so , _we_ love our freedom and our freedom _of_ choice and , um , having [people] _like_ 
B|11| M: _I know ,_ right ? It's [like] they're _not_ even trying . 
A|12| B: Yeah , _I think_ _that's_ , uh , _I think_ _that's_ [a] good term , demanding _the_ time for yourself . That you've _just_ got _to_ you've _just_ got _to_ 
B|13| M: It's [the] eastside . 
A|14| B: And , uh , _we_ , [I] [do] some interesting recycling things . 
B|15| M:  
A|16| B: Interesting thing about gas is when , [I] mean , about battery powered cars is when you're at [a] stop light , you're [not] using any any energy 
B|17| M: Hehehehe . 
A|18| B: Right . [I] mean Sunday dinner _was_ at my grandmother's and _, [you_ [know] ,] [like] [I] said _there_ would be thirty _, [you_ [know] ,] thirty [people] , and everyone would _just_ bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook . 
B|19| M: Uhhh 
A|20| B: They're _in_ Missouri and [I] could , [I] , [I know ,] [I know] stories for _sure_ _that they_ _just_ , _they_ , _they_ _just_ , well , _they_ can't take [the] proper care _of_ them . Most _of_ them . 
B|21| M: Oh _, that's_ cool . It _was in_ Mississippi . 
A|22| B: And , uh , _it's_ , _it's_ tragic _that_ _, [you_ [know] ,] when [people] _live_ so long _that they_ , uh , [don't _have] a_ really [don't _have] _a_ place_ _to_ go . 
B|23| M: [I've] heard [of] [that] too . 
A|24| B: That's what she plans _to_ [do] . 
B|25| M: [I] [live] [in [a] place] where [we] _can_ play over here . 
A|26| B: Uh-huh . 
B|27| M: _Do you_ play baseball ? 
A|28| B: unless there's some trend or something [that] says , Jesus this neighborhood has [been] hit forty-seven times or whatever . Uh [, that's] [, that's] sort [of] more [of] , [of] [a] pattern news . 
B|29| M: Are [you] guys _on_ [the] same _course_ ? 
A|30| B: And _a lot of_ them decide _just_ [not] _to_ [have] children . 
B|31| M: [I think] [it's] funny [that _they] think_ [you] 
A|32| B: And , because my daughter calls [it] her gravy and [I] mean , she thinks [it's] wonderful , my , good , you're [a] picky eater , _if I can_ get [you] _to_ , 
B|33| M: I'm [not] [sure] [if I _can] _do_ _that_ ._ 
A|34| B: [I know ,] and [that] makes me so mad _You_ [know ,] [it] is [like] [it] is [not] going _to_ [do that] much damage _to_ [the] [course] _, but_ apparently [they think] differently 
B|35| M: She nods . 
A|36| B: and [it] turns out great , because [I] mean , you've got [like] hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and _, [you_ [know] ,] bacon and _all_ [that] good stuff . 
B|37| M: [I] [don't] , I'm [not] [a] robot . 
A|38| B: Yeah , [I] , [I think] [that's] Yeah . Yeah . 
B|39| M: Yes [, but] [we] [do] need [to] spend money _on_ education . 
A|40| B: Right . 
B|41| M: There's [a lot of] pollution down [there] 
A|42| B: And , uh , [it] , [I think] [that's] what happens when [they] get scattered , [the] , [the] family unit _, [you_ [know] ,] falls , into disrepair . 
B|43| M: I'm [not] [sure] . 
A|44| B: [Do you] read [a] newspaper ? 
B|45| M: right . 
A|46| B: Well , [I] [have] [seen a] big change , [I think] , [in] high school kids [that] my relatives and friends , [that] , um , [I know] when [I] [was in] high school [I] had an idea [of] what [I] really wanted [to] [do] with what my , what [I] [was] going [to] study 
B|47| M: [you] . 
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M: Why [not] ? 
A|50| B: [How] are [they] built ? 
B|51| M: [You] [have a] cat ? 
A|52| B: [I] would [have] thought , 
B|53| M: But they're [all] dead , right ? 
A|54| B: Yeah , [it's] really neat . And , uh , uh , [course] [I've] [been] working [on] [it] for five years [, but] _, [you_ [know] ,] 
B|55| M: [You] [don't] need [to] [know] [if] [he's] _a real_ person [, you] [just] need [to] [see] [it] . 
A|56| B: [I] really believe [that .] And [it] has , um , helped us [to] afford some things for our children [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [I think] are wonderful particularly at this age , and [I think] our kids are [real] secure . And [have [a] real] sense [of] priorities and [that they] [can do] anything and be anything both male and female [a lot]
