B|83| M: [I think] [it's] mostly [the] first [one] . 
A|84| B: _it's a_ hard _question_ [, you] look at [the] United States , we [have] [the] largest murder rate [of] [any] developed [, uh ,] 
B|85| M: _You [know ,_ I] [just] [don't like] tacos . 
A|86| B: Well , that's [good] . 
B|87| M: [How] [is] [it] ? 
A|88| B: _Yeah_ .

A|104| B: _and the_ garages [were] always , if [the] house [was] large [, it] seemed [like the] garages [were] small even if [they] [were] three car garages which [is] _what_ we [have] .
