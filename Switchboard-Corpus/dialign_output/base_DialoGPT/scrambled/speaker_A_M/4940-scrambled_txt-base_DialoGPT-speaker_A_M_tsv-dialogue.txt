B|43| M: Serial murder 
A|44| A: Potato [salad] _and_ [, uh ,] 
B|45| M: [I think] [the] majority _of them are_ [, and] [I] _like_ [the] song [, but] _I don't know_ [if] [that] s [a] majority . 
A|46| A: In fact _, I_ am at work right now . Uh [, and] so let me take [the] lead [, uh ,] Angela .

B|47| M: Uuhhh [, yes] ? 
A|48| A: _No ._ Yeah _, [I_ think] so . [I think] it's an investment _in_ [your] future , even [if] it's purely [not] , [not] religious . _You can_ at least [say that] it's important _to_ our country , [that] our family unit stays strong . 
B|49| M: Just [don't] [go] 
A|50| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is pretty] much [the same] . So [I] _, [I_ think] most [of them are] _there_ _was_ , [it] , [like] most areas [that] [are] built , um , _there_ were probably , [like] two or three styles [you] could choose from 
B|51| M: [I'm] sorry ? 
A|52| A: Uh-huh .

A|58| A: [Do you] [know] where [that] [is ?] 
B|59| M: [You can] shoot through
