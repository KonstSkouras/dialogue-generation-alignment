B|77| M: [Yes .] [but] [what] 
A|78| A: Yeah . T [I] got _, uh ,_ [a lot of] advances [in] [it] [really .] [Uh] , hopefully _this_ will turn [out] [to be] [a good] program _for_ us . We [sure] need _, uh [,_ the] business . Okay , Current Events . [Uh] [, [you] ,] you've got [the] [question] [you] _can_ [go] first there , since [I] called . 
B|79| M: _I'm_ [so] you're [not] [uh [,] and] [uh [,] we] [can] you're 
A|80| A: Yeah . 
B|81| M: [I live in] Canada

B|83| M: [I] am ... 
A|84| A: my husband likes Pepsi [and] those cans [are] steel instead [of] aluminum , [so] [we] [can't] , [can't] ever recycle _them_ . [I think it's a good] reason [to] quit buying [it .] 
B|85| M: [That's] . 
A|86| A: [That's] funny . 
B|87| M: _I'm ,_ [um ,] [just] talking [in] general . 
A|88| A: _Um [,_ you] [know ,] different things _, is it_ restricted [to] certain _crimes_ ? Or [just] , 
B|89| M: [Um ,] [um ,] [um] ... 
A|90| A: Okay . 
B|91| M: [I think] [they're] volunteering [for] community 
A|92| A: Which [is] scary [, you] [know ,] pretty scary when [so] many _people_ [get [it] .] So [, I] guess [I'm [,] [I'm] ,] [I'd] [like] [to see] us spend more . [I don't know] [that] spending more always gets [it .] 
B|93| M: [They] [don't] [really] care . [They] [just] punish [the] [people] who commit [crimes] . [They] [don't] [even] care [about] [the] [people] committing [crimes] . 
A|94| A: Our anger [is] going [to] [have] [to] [, to] give rise [to] [, to] more activity [on] our part . 
B|95| M: [I'm] [not] [the] only one who thinks [this] [, uh [,] is [it] just] me [or] [is it] 
A|96| A: Yeah . 
B|97| M: [You] [can] watch [them] [, but] _they don't_ [like] [it .] 
A|98| A: [And] [they don't] look at [it] [so] much as [, you] [know ,] 
B|99| M: Are [you [,] uh ,] interested [in] [any] [of] [this] ? 
A|100| A: [Oh [,] I've] never [heard] [of] Polk [but] , 
B|101| M: You're 
A|102| A: _No_ , we're [not] [I don't think] . [I think] , that's more realistic [than] making [them] [go] [in the] Peace Corps . 
B|103| M: Is [that] [a] dog ? 
A|104| A: [Oh ,] that's great , sounds [like] [you ,] 
B|105| M: [No]
