B|35| M: They're _all the_ same . 
A|36| A: Right . 
B|37| M: _I'm_ [not] [sure] . 
A|38| A: [Oh ,] [all the] time . Do [you] watch CHEERS

B|41| M: _I'm_ sorry [, but] _I'm_ [not] [sure] _what_ [you] _mean_ _by_ _that ._ 
A|42| A: [Well [,] um ,] actually [it] , we've sort [of] _had_ _an_ ideal Spring . 
B|43| M: _You_

A|50| A: Ugh ! 
B|51| M: _they have_ [an] hour [left] _. they_ [are] [just] gonna rollback _a lot of_ [the] servers . 
A|52| A: _and_ nope _, we_ haven't _had_ [much] luck with [it] we're going [to] try [it] again [this] year . 
B|53| M: We've [been] [to] _every_ summer since [we] _were_ _kids_ . 
A|54| A: [Well ,] _yeah_ _, it_ keeps [, uh ,] well [, it's] doing real well , because when [we] got [this] _place_ [the] _, the_ dirt [was] [just] overgrazed 
B|55| M:  
A|56| A: Uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [I] _don't_ [think] [so] . 
A|58| A: Huh [. You] learn something [every] day . 
B|59| M: It [is] [, but] [I] _don't_ [think it's] old . 
A|60| A: [Yeah .] 
B|61| M: [Yeah ,] [I'm] [not] [sure] [what] [you] _mean_ . 
A|62| A: Right [. they] 
B|63| M: _Oh [._ Uh] . 
A|64| A: Um , [so] [you] [like] [to] listen [to] [, uh ,] [a lot of] music , or [do] , [is] [it] talk shows . 
B|65| M: [You] [know] 
A|66| A: [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: It's [a] [nice] [place] [to] live . 
A|68| A: Uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [I] [know [,] right] ? 
A|70| A: [And] when [we] got back [to] Dallas [it] seemed _really_ dry because [it's] kind [of] [like] [what] you're used [to] . [But] [I] agree with [you] _, the_ humidity , especially for curly heads [like] me . 
B|71| M: [I] _don't_ care . 
A|72| A: [And] [, uh ,] evaluation [of] [an] individual . Course , [all] [of] [it] depends on [the] type [of] job responsibility [you have] _. I_ [think] [you have] [to] dress sort [of] accordingly . 
B|73| M: [Yeah [,] we] [did] [, uh , we [had] , uh] ... 
A|74| A: _No ,_ I've done some walking with friends _in the_ past . 
B|75| M: It's [a] weightless [, uh ,] crusher . 
A|76| A: Than [we] [think] . Sure . Sure . 
B|77| M: Why [did] [you] [say] [it] ? 
A|78| A: Uh-huh . Huh . Uh-huh . 
B|79| M: Ohh . 
A|80| A: Probably [the] biggest items [that] [, uh ,] [that] [you] get _in_ our neighborhood , or , would be [the] high classed automobiles _, the_ _, you know ,_ Mercedes , Volvos , things [that] [they] [can] get _, you know ,_ _big_ dollars for _and_ [the] jewelry [are] [the] major targets , 
B|81| M: [Yeah .] It's [the] reason why [I] live [in] Florida . 
A|82| A: _and_ [so] often [they] [think] they're adequately caring for themselves when they're _really_ [not] eating very [much] or very balanced meals . 
B|83| M: ohhh [yeah .] 
A|84| A: They pay [that] judge , [they] pay those jury members very little money compared [to] [that] judge 
B|85| M: [You] [like] lasagna ? 
A|86| A: Um . [But] [I] guess [it's] [just] [one] [of] those things where if [they] if _that's_ what's something [it's] [a] need for them _you _know_ ._ 
B|87| M: What [do] [you] _mean_ ? 
A|88| A: Okay . 
B|89| M: [I] ,, 
A|90| A: [it's] [just] [that] [, I] didn't [, I] hate having [to] be [in] charge [of] someone else's life . 
B|91| M: [Yeah] [but] [I'm] [, you know [,] the] [one] [that's] [being] made 
A|92| A: [Well [,] I] [, I] feel _the other_ thing too [, uh ,] [they] [were] saying [, uh [,] you know ,] [what] new ways could could [it] [, you] [, you know ,] change [the] system _. I_ [, I] _really_ [think] [that] [, uh , we] spend [a lot of] time [, uh ,] going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal [, _I] mean ,_ if [you] go [to] [a] trial [by] jury _and_ especially if [a] person has confessed . If [they have] [been] caught [, you know ,] point blank _in the_ crime . There's [, uh ,] no question 
B|93| M: [I mean ,] 
A|94| A: _and_ [that's] [not] necessarily fair . 
B|95| M: [And the] worst _part_ [is] [that] [the] majority [of] [the] population [was] [in the] middle [of] [the] city . 
A|96| A: [And] [, uh ,] 
B|97| M: [No [,] it's] [not] . 
A|98| A: Uh-huh . You'd [have] [a lot of] hills [in] [that] , _down_ [in] [that] area . 
B|99| M: [That's] . [the] . [about] . [about] . 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] 
B|101| M: [You] can't . It's [the] best . 
A|102| A: [Uh ,] we've got plenty , [in] fact , we've got far too many . You're [in] [, uh ,] [what] Flower Mound ? 
B|103| M: [So .] 
A|104| A: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [This is] [a] [big] _problem ._ 
A|106| A: [but] I've enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|107| M: [I just] [had a] kitten . 
A|108| A: [I like] [it] [, uh ,] [part] [of] my [problem] [is] [I] [have] small children , [so] [, uh ,] [to] [do] [a] whole [lot] [just] requires [a lot of] , oh , coordination as far as scheduling _and_ [that] type [of] [, uh ,] deal [, you know [,] uh ,] 
B|109| M:  
A|110| A: [Yes _.] I_ [do] [not] [like] [the] 
B|111| M:  
A|112| A: [Yeah .] [Well [,] we had] growing up [I] guess [I] [can] talk [about] us . [We] [had] nine [kids] [in] our family . [We] [had] eight boys _and_ [one] girl . [But] , my Dad [, uh ,] 
B|113| M: Are [you] ? 
A|114| A: [Yeah .] 
B|115| M: [I] [know .] It's [just] [, I] _don't_ [really] [know] [what] [the other] guy [was] thinking . 
A|116| A: see [you] [don't] necessarily [have] [to] dip [this] stuff . [And] [, um [,] I] [was] going [to] [have] broccoli _and_ cauliflower for [a] , [a] vegetable . 
B|117| M: [he] sits [down] [, and] [I] sit [down] 
A|118| A: Right , research triangle [and] [all] [of] [that .] 
B|119| M: [I'm] [in the] US . 
A|120| A: Nice talking [to] [you] . Bye-bye 
B|121| M:  ? 
A|122| A: [So] [he] gets [a] break two days [a] week [but] [it's] only for [like] two or three hours at [a] time . 
B|123| M: Uhhuhuhuh [. I] [don't] [know .] 
A|124| A: [So] [I] [can] see where [that] , [that] , may be [a] [problem .] 
B|125| M: [And] [that's] [, uh [,] it] . 
A|126| A: [Oh .] 
B|127| M: Not . 
A|128| A: Right . [That] will , 
B|129| M: [I] am . 
A|130| A: [Oh ,] well , [yeah]
