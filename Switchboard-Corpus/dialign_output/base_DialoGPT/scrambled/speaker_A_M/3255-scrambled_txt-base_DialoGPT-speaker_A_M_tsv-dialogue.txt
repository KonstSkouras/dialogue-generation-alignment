B|37| M: [I'm] [going to] [say] [it .] The _cats ._ 
A|38| A: There _is_ always things [that] [you] can make priority [to] [it] [but I] just _, [I_ don't] demand [a lot] for myself and [so] [you know _,] I_ just feel entitled [to] [it] 
B|39| M: _I'm not_ sure [. [I] don't know] [if you] [are] saying [that] [or] [what] [you] _mean_ by [that .]
