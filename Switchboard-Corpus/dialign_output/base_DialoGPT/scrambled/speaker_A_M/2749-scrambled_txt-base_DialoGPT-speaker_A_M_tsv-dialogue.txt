B|1| M: Yea [I] _know_ . 
A|2| A: Uh-huh . _Well , I_ do . [I] _just_ _, I_ love _it_ . _It's_ such _, I_ _just_ _think_ _it's_ such _a_ fun sport . And _, uh ,_ _I'm_ _just_ hoping _that_ _the_ Broncos can _get_ _back_ on their feet . We're _not_ convinced _that_ we're going _to_ be Cowboy fans yet . _But_ _, uh ,_ 
B|3| M: _Oh ,_ well _, yeah [,_ I] guess _that's_ _interesting_ 
A|4| A: So , maybe _you_ would , 
B|5| M: Yea . [That is] _pretty much_ what _it is_ . 
A|6| A: [I] _don't_ , do _you_ [know] if Virginia has [it] ? 
B|7| M: helicoptering 
A|8| A: _that's the problem_ [I] _have_ _with_ [it] , _in_ Texas _they_ _think_ _it's_ _and_ _all_ _and_ be _all_ , _they_ _think_ _that_ if _they_ electrocute or slip , or do something , or gas somebody _, uh ,_ _that_ they're _not_ going _to_ _have_ _the_ crimes _that_ _they_ do _have_ _and_ _we_ happen _to_ _live in_ Dallas which [is] extremely crime , ridden , 
B|9| M: They're [all] free 
A|10| A: That'd probably be [pretty] [interesting] . _I was_ summonsed down _to_ _the_ courthouse last week . They _had_ summonsed eight hundred _people_ , about four hundred showed up , _and_ [it] _was_ for _a_ murder trial . 
B|11| M:  . 
A|12| A: but , _you_ [know] , seems like there's _just_ _so_ many things _to_ do down here [, I] like _the_ sports [, I] play _a_ lot _of_ racquetball . 
B|13| M: [I'm] 
A|14| A: And _then_ before _the_ milk gets too hot , um [, I] add two beaten eggs _and_ [I] really mix them _in_ good . And _then_ about _a_ half _a_ cup _of_ sugar _and_ [I] let [it] [pretty much] [, I] beat [it] like every minute for about ten seconds _and_ _it's_ , [it] starts thickening , when [it] thickens _the_ cornstarch might _get_ _a_ little [, I] _don't_ [know] , [it] gets like little globs _of_ this rubbery cornstarch , _and_ _you_ _just_ keep beating [it] _in ._ And _it's the_ , _the_ trick [is] , [is] _to_ _have_ this blender , _so_ , if _you_ _were_ , you'd _have_ _to_ probably almost go out _and_ someone who's _just_ going _to_ make [it] first time _, it's_ , you'll _have_ [much] _better_ luck if _you_ _had_ one _of_ these little blenders . And _then_ _you_ can add cocoa powder _to_ [it] _to_ make chocolate or after _it's_ thickened [I] cook [it] for _a_ good , once [it] starts boiling [, I] _just_ [, I] cook [it] for _a_ good seven minutes , seven _to_ ten minutes 
B|15| M: _I [,_ uh ,] [don't] [think] _he's_ gonna , _he's_ [, uh] ... [not] [a] guy . 
A|16| A: _No_ . 
B|17| M: She's [a] nurse . 
A|18| A: [I] [think] [that's] true . 
B|19| M: Do [you] [live in] [the] [back] _of the_ house ? 
A|20| A: Yeah , [it is] hard 
B|21| M: You [were] [the] dog . 
A|22| A: My truck [is] broken down . 
B|23| M: [No] [, _I] mean_ [the] dog . 
A|24| A: [I [,] [I] ,] I'd force them . [I] [think] _that_ [, uh [,] I] [think] [it] would be [, I] [think] [I] [think] [a] lot [of] kids actually do [a] lot [of] _work and_ _no_ one _just_ realizes [it] . 
B|25| M: [But] _he's_ an ex cop . 
A|26| A: Uh-huh . 
B|27| M: [Well ,] [that's] , read . 
A|28| A: And , [you] [know] , _just_ , [you] see [a] lot [of] things like [you] , [you] [know] , _was a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play golf when he retired , _and_ [you] [know] _that_ [a] lot [of the] things he thought he would do when he retired [he's] [not] able _to_ do now . 
B|29| M: what does [that] even _mean_ ? 
A|30| A: Yes , yes , I've known _people_ _with_ effectively worthless degrees [in] this country . [I mean] , _and_ they're highly educated _people_ , but [of] course , if you're educated _and_ [you] [don't] speak English , _no_ one thinks anything [of] [you] . 
B|31| M: There [is] [no] way [that] [I] could [live] [with] [that] . 
A|32| A: [Oh ,] sure . 
B|33| M: Uh , we've never [had] [a] break [in .] 
A|34| A: And [I] thought , [you] [know] , [that] really , now [that] [I'm] thirty years old [, I] [think] [that] one or two years out [of] my life would _have_ , probably like [you] said , _to_ be able _to_ travel some place else whether [it] be [the] United States or outside [the] country [, I] [think] [it] would _have_ been [a] very good , um , experience for me . 
B|35| M: [I was] [just] kidding . 
A|36| A: Bye-bye . 
B|37| M: There [was a] moment where [we] [all] agreed [to] tip each _other_ . 
A|38| A: [Oh ,] _they_ help [you] . 
B|39| M: You [mean] there _are_ 
A|40| A: Andrews ? 
B|41| M: [Well , I] guess [it is] . 
A|42| A: Um . 
B|43| M: Are [they] happy [with] your decision ? 
A|44| A: Yes [, yeah ,] [we] [had] summer lasting long _and then_ [it] , _then_ [it] , _then_ [it] became winter like [, uh] today _it's_ , today _it's_ sort [of] change [to] warmer [to] sort [of] more typical autumn day . 
B|45| M: June 
A|46| A: Um , 
B|47| M: [I'm] [so] 
A|48| A: That's sweet [, I] _have_ [the] two , [the] [other] two cats [I] _have_ [are] outdoor cats . 
B|49| M: [It's] [a] shame [they] [don't] [have] [a] [better] way [to] spend money . 
A|50| A: Yeah . So [other] than [the] Vikings , _who_ do [you] like ? 
B|51| M: You [think] they'd [have] [a] choice ? 
A|52| A: Uh-huh , [that] [was] one [of the] most wonderful vacations I've ever [had] . 
B|53| M: [It's] [not] [the] money [that's the problem] [, [it's] the] [people] [who] [work and] [get] paid . 
A|54| A: _We_ , [we] originally lived [in] Dallas [and] [we] met [and] got married 
B|55| M: [We] [have] mosquit . 
B|56| M:  ... [and then] ?
