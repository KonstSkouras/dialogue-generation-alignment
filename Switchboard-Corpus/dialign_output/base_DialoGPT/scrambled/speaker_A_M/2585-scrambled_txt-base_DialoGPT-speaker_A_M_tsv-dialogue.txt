A|54| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . 
B|55| M: She [had] [a] pet [, _and] she's_ [now] [in a] relationship . 
A|56| A: [I don't] see someone [not] [going] out [there] [and] committing [murder] because they're afraid they're [going to] get sentenced [to] death [. _I] mean ,_ most people out [there] committing murders [don't] care . 
B|57| M: They're pretty [good] . 
A|58| A: Uh-huh . 
B|59| M: [I mean [,] it's] similar _to the_ hydraulic jack . 
A|60| A: Uh-huh . 
B|61| M: _Not_ 
A|62| A: [She's] ninety-two . 
B|63| M: [I don't think] [so [,] but] [I'm] [not] [sure] . 
A|64| A: [Not] [that] [I was] looking [for] sports cars [, but] , [now] [the] people I've talked [to] [don't] seem [to] [have] stick shift . 
B|65| M: Your mother [has] cats ? 
A|66| A: Uh-huh , wow , _yeah_ . 
B|67| M: [I'm] _sorry ._ 
A|68| A: Uh-huh . 
B|69| M: Why [do] [you] hate free ? 
A|70| A: [I] _know_ [, and] [, uh ,] [the] police [are] [not] [going to] [do] anything until they [, they've] committed some sort [of] [a] crime . [You] _know_ , he [was] [just] begging her on [the] phone , [that's] [not] doing anything . 
B|71| M: Social welfare 
A|72| A: [Oh] , _yeah ,_ _yeah ,_ _yeah_ . 
B|73| M: It . [uh [,] uh] 
A|74| A: [Well , I] [can't] [think] [of] anything else really about [the] polls or voting _, to_ talk about . 
B|75| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] . 
A|76| A: Uh-huh . 
B|77| M: i . 
A|78| A: let's see , what [was] [it] , three quarters [of] cup [of] rice or , 
B|79| M: [Well , [I] don't [know] .] 
A|80| A: [Oh] , my . 
B|81| M: They [have] [that] [now] ? 
A|82| A: [Yeah] . 
B|83| M: _Yeah , I_ don'like [that] . 
A|84| A: My word isn't [that] [sorry .] [That's] [sorry .] 
B|85| M: [yeah [,] to] 
A|86| A: Okay . 
B|87| M:  
A|88| A: [and] her , [the] rest [of] her family [and] her regular doctors [and] everybody she trusted [and] knew [was] [in] Dayton [, and] [were] several thousand miles away 
B|89| M: [I guess] [so] . 
A|90| A: Uh-huh . Right [, [right] .] 
B|91| M: N ? 
A|92| A: [Yeah ,] okay , [so] this [is] probably [a] real hard subject [for] [you] . 
B|93| M: _He_ [was] [found] innocent . 
A|94| A: [Well , I] [have] this new fondue pot [and] [I was] [going to] [do] basic cheese fondue [, and] [I] [have] two different kinds [of] breads [and] some ham [and] [I was] [going to] try something [weird] which , [you] [know] , when [you have] fish au gratin _, I was_ [going to] [make] some [, uh ,] _like_ fish chunks [and] dip [it] [in the] fondue [. [I don't] know] if [it] will come out . 
B|95| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] . 
A|96| A: [And] since [I was] [just] , [you] [know] , one [of the] office folk [, I guess] [it] wasn't as important _to them_ [that] they test me regularly . But [I] [know] they test most [of the] service people fairly regularly [uh ,] [just] across [the] board . 
B|97| M: It [was] [like ,] [a] lot [of] times [, uh ,] times . 
A|98| A: [and] [then] [we] put [that] on [the] computer [and] [then] [we] took about three months [and] [, uh [,] and] adjusted , where [we] could come down [and] where [we] didn't want [to] come down , 
B|99| M: Huh [, uh] . 
A|100| A: [Yeah] [that] would be [a good] idea . 
B|101| M: Umm ... [I think] [that's] [a] myth . 
A|102| A: [Yeah , [I] think] [in] today's society [, uh ,] [there] [is] more credibility [to] be quite honest 
B|103| M: [I'm] [sorry .] [I'm] [sorry] [I'm] [so] [sorry .] 
A|104| A: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [And so] [I] said [to them] 
A|106| A: [She's] [, [I] mean] [she's] [that] , this young [and she's] almost housebroken . 
B|107| M: Hehehuh 
A|108| A: [And] [I] would [not] [have] [been] fun trying [to] retrieve her [, but] [, uh ,] this dog , Dennis jumped [in] [and] got this look on his face [like] what [do] [I do] [now] , as he's floating down [the] river [then] finally discovered [that] he could swim [and] [, uh ,] actually paddled up against [the] current [and] [, uh ,] made [it] back [to the] shore [and] climbed up [and] [then] , he , he jumped [in] again [, and] he [was] swimming [for] quite [a bit] , [all] afternoon . [He] loved [it .] 
B|109| M: [It's] ... 
A|110| A: Yes , yes . 
B|111| M: You've [been] using [the] heat ? 
A|112| A: [and] [, uh ,] [it] seems [to] [just] blow [the] competition away . 
B|113| M:  . 
B|114| M: [No] [, I was] [the] teacher [for] [the] high school .
