A|0| A: _Is that a_ nice vacation spot ? 
B|1| M: _Well _,_ I_ _mean_ _, I can't_ _really_ _help_ _you_ _with_ _that _,_ _but_ I_ _can_ _help_ _you_ . 
A|2| A: We've _been_ real lucky . _So ,_ 
B|3| M: _they_ 
A|4| A: They _don't_ _go_ _and_ see _them _._ That's_ _right ._ 
B|5| M: How _bad_ ? 
A|6| A: [I] took _one_ lesson _one_ _other_ _time_ . Besides [that _,] uh , I_ just _, uh ,_ try _to_ make _the_ club hit _the_ ball . 
B|7| M: I'll _be_ _going _to_ a_ _state_ _school _in_ the_ northeast _, and_ that'll _be_ [the] best part . 
A|8| A: _you know ,_ [in] terms _of_ , *listen; [with] previous slash unit ? [and] [in] terms _of_ housing _down here_ , um _, you_ [really] _have_ your pick [but] _it's_ just everything's overpriced _for_ [the] economy . 
B|9| M: Japan 
A|10| A: Now _how_ _do you mean_ [that] ? [I] _know_ _it ,_ 
B|11| M: There _are_ [, uh ,] lots [of] _things_ [to] _be_ _done_ [down here] . 
A|12| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| M: _uh _, uh ,_ uh_ 
A|14| A: _Oh ._ 
B|15| M: [That's] _not_ [how] [it] works . 
A|16| A: _The_ men [that] [are] _out_ _there_ fixing power lines [are] tested [a] lot [and] [the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with] , _with the_ guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't tested as _much_ . 
B|17| M: [Is that a] _thing_ ? 
A|18| A: _So _,_ it's been_ _fun_ . 
B|19| M: Uuhuh . 
A|20| A: _Yeah_ , _they're_ , _they're_ _pretty good ._ They've _got_ some _good_ _good_ , some _good_ [, uh ,] _good_ players _out_ _there_ . 
B|21| M: A _dog_ 
A|22| A: _Yeah_ [, _I] love_ [to] cook , _too_ _, I'm_ [, uh ,] 
B|23| M:  
A|24| A: 'cause _if_ she fell [in] _then_ _I'd_ [of] _been_ , _had_ [to] _go in_ after her . _And_ _up_ [here] [the] water's _probably_ _about_ forty degrees _right_ _now ._ 
B|25| M: Do _you _have_ a_ _home_ ? 
A|26| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|27| M: What's [the] difference ? 
A|28| A: Who _is that_ ? 
B|29| M:  ... 
A|30| A: _Yeah _._ _I_ think it_ would also [help] _them_ _if_ [they] _then_ went _on_ [to] college _. I_ _know_ [that] _my_ _first_ couple [of] _years_ [of] college _were_ , um [, uh ,] _probably_ _too_ carefree _at the_ , beginning 
B|31| M:  . [now .] 
A|32| A: Uh-huh . 
B|33| M: [The] fish 
A|34| A: _And_ _we_ just _had a_ [really] big ice storm . _And ,_ basically , half [the] trees [in] , [in] our city _, I'm in_ Rochester which _is_ [, uh] _right_ upstate . Half _of the_ trees [in the] city [, uh ,] [are] no _good_ anymore . 
B|35| M: _I guess_ _she's_ _not_ [too] fond _of it_ [then] . 
A|36| A: _and [,_ uh [,] but] _he_ will [, uh ,] he'll flip around _, I think_ [the] _other_ night _we had_ _on_ [, [uh , uh] ,] _it was_ [a] , _it was_ car races , some kind [of] car races where _they were_ bumping over hills [and] flying into [the] air [and] coming [down] _. _I_ _don't know_ what_ channel _he_ found [that] _on_ 
B|37| M: _Yes _._ Yeah ._ It's [, it's] . 
A|38| A: Um , well , [the] comfort [of] [a] large car _that the_ security [of] [a] large car . Um [, and] [the] luxuries [of] [a] large car . 
B|39| M: Carbon fuel 
A|40| A: _Oh ._ 
B|41| M: _I _,_ and _,_ right ._ 
A|42| A: Uh-huh . 
B|43| M: Yea [, _but] _I_ can't_ _say_ [I'd] _be_ [up] [there] _without_ seeing _a few_ _people ._ 
A|44| A: _And_ [I] _had a_ _great_ _time_ doing _that ._ _It was_ [really] interesting . 
B|45| M:  ... 
A|46| A: Other than [that] _he_ gets scared [to] _death_ _. If you_ shut [that] door _he_ goes into hiding . 
B|47| M: [I think] _you're_ _wrong [,_ I'm] [right .] 
A|48| A: _They're_ just getting [, uh ,] put _on_ probation or _something_ , because [the] prisons _don't _have_ enough_ room so [they] _get_ _, they_ _get_ lighter sentences , 
B|49| M: [I] am , 
A|50| A: Right 
B|51| M: [And [,] it's been] [a] _long_ [time] since [we [had] a] system _like that ._ 
A|52| A: [Yes .] 
B|53| M: [Oh .] _Well_ [I [don't] have] any [good] ideas . 
A|54| A: Um . Boy _I [like_ that .] 
B|55| M: Uhuhuh . Uhuhuhuh 
A|56| A: [Yeah] , well _, a cat_ will _do_ _the same_ trick 
B|57| M: [I'm] reading [a] book [, uh ,] _about the_ [first] world war [, uh] 
A|58| A: _That_ _is_ _for_ _sure ._ 
B|59| M: _No _,_ they don't_ . [The] seeds [go [in] the] tomatoes . 
A|60| A: _Oh [,_ I] imagine . 
B|61| M: [I'm] _not_ seeing [you] 
A|62| A: [and] [now] [I _,] I've_ lost _my_ excuse _for that_ so [I] _have to_ _for_ [the] last couple [of] _years_ _I've_ [done] [it] myself . 
B|63| M: _Well [,_ I'm] _not_ [a] criminal [, but] [I'm] [pretty] [sure] [if] _I _was_ ,_ [I'd] [get] [a] sentence . 
A|64| A: Okay 
B|65| M:  . 
A|66| A: They [, they] became , [in] fact _, that's_ _probably_ _what's_ [going to] happen _with my_ husband's mother . _She's_ [going to] endanger herself before she'll willingly [and] _probably_ will never willingly make [the] decision . [And] [that] scares _me_ [the] , [the] thought [of] forcing somebody _to do_ _something ._ 
B|67| M: _Because_ [it's] 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| M: _Uh_ huh . 
A|70| A: Okay . 
B|71| M: It's _okay ._ 
A|72| A: _You don't_ sound [like] [you're] [in the] north . _You_ sound [like] [you're] [in the] south somewhere . 
B|73| M: It's [the same] reason [you] _can't_ _agree_ _to a_ political protest . It's _a [right_ .] 
A|74| A: Uh-huh . 
B|75| M: [They're] _still_ trying [to] add [it [,] _and] _they_ have_ [the] technology [to do] _it ._ 
A|76| A: [Uh] , she enjoys mowing _. [I_ can't] believe [it .] 
B|77| M: uhuhuh . [and] [I] [uh [, _I] think] ._ 
A|78| A: [And] [I don't] [like] [the] idea [of [it] [,] it's] [, it's] , makes [too] _much_ [of] [a] big brother type [of] [thing] . 
B|79| M: [the] recycle recycle 
A|80| A: Right [, right] _, that's [,_ uh ,] 
B|81| M: _Well [,_ uh , uh] . 
A|82| A: Uh-huh . 
B|83| M: _And [, uh [,_ I] think] _, you know , and_ 
A|84| A: [That's] nice . _We_ , um , [we] canoed [up] [in] Arkansas _at the_ Buffalo River . 
B|85| M: [She's] _a little_ [too] smart [for [that] .] 
A|86| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|87| M: [We] [are] . 
A|88| A: [Uh] . Uh-huh . 
B|89| M: [I'm] _not_ [sure .] 
A|90| A: _Are you_ [going to] move your whole _family_ over [there] [then] ? 
B|91| M: Did [you] [go] [to] _school_ ? 
A|92| A: Yep . 
B|93| M: _No [,_ [they] were] talking _about the_ crimes . 
A|94| A: Uh-huh . 
B|95| M: [I don't [know] [,] I've] [been] [to] [the] US . 
A|96| A: [Is that] just family's lack [of] priority , anymore _, maybe_ yes , [we] [get] so _involved_ [in] our work lives [and] just , social lives [and] so forth . 
B|97| M: [You] [can't] [really] learn new skill _when_ [you] [are] _older_ [, it's] _like _you have_ to_ _be_ [really] [good] [at] [something .] 
A|98| A: [And , uh _,] not_ necessarily [, you know ,] give [in] [to] their [, uh ,] _human_ rights desires . [You] [know ,] [if] _they're_ overcrowded , just keep cramming _them_ [in] [there] till [they] just suffocate . [Uh] , 
B|99| M: [Is] [there] any radio station [that] _has_ [the same] radio ? 
A|100| A: Uh-huh . 
B|101| M: It's [a] joke 
A|102| A: [No ,] _they're_ , all _of them_ [are] tested once every three 
B|103| M: Rosebtwink 
A|104| A: Anyway [, _it's] a_ tough question . 
B|105| M: [Is] [there] any way [to] change [the] date [of the] month ? 
A|106| A: But she _got_ credits [for] _it ?_ 
B|107| M: [The] neighborhood ? 
A|108| A: Everyone would appeal _. That's_ true , [too] . 
B|109| M: [You] ' . 
A|110| A: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: Why ? 
A|112| A: [No ,] no [I think] [the] um sometimes [I guess] _what_ did [I] read recently [the] um [the] [uh] Christian [uh] point _is_ _is_ always [the] point [of] well [it's] [at] conception [but] [then] um [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception _is_ [a] biblical term . [And] there's no concept [of] conception [in] medicine or biology . 
B|113| M:  ... 
A|114| A: _We have_ _family_ [that] lives outside [of the] [state] so [we] [go] visit both sets [of] grandparents _and , and_ take car trips . 
B|115| M: You're [not] aww 
A|116| A: [Yeah .] 
B|117| M: [You] [mean] _she's_ [not] ? 
A|118| A: Wow . 
B|119| M: June . 
A|120| A: [Uh] , no _but I think_ _that's_ _that's_ [uh] [it's] _that's_ taxpayer's _money_ _. If_ somebody buys their own flag [and] [and] burns [it] _that's_ fine [but] [that] _that's_ [you know] _that's_ destruction [and] [of] [uh] public property [and] whatever . 
B|121| M: [So ,] [what] ? 
A|122| A: Okay , [it] does sound [like you have] some children [to] take _care_ [of] 
B|123| M: A [cat] [, a cat] [, and] [a cat] . 
A|124| A: [Yeah] 
B|125| M:  ... [I [,] I'm] confused . 
A|126| A: [And] [that] might [be] [a] partial solution , or [something .] 
B|127| M: It's 
A|128| A: Huh _That_ _is_ _good ._ 
B|129| M: Uhhh [, you know [,] I'm] [a] [human] . 
A|130| A: [And] [we] went [to a] pen [of] [a little] bit bigger dogs [and] all [the] others [were] standing [there] barking [and] jumping [up] [and] [down] . [And] _one_ [dog] would stand [there] wagging her tail [and] smiling [And] [that ,] [was] mine . 
B|131| M: _I'm sure_ [there] [are] _many_ [other] countries [that] [don't have] _this_ problem . 
A|132| A: [And] [this] _is_ _money_ [that] [she's] borrowed [to] form her college education ? 
B|133| M: _Well ,_ _he was_ almost twelve [years] old . 
A|134| A: Really ? 
B|135| M: Uhhh . [it's a] [thing] 
A|136| A: Uh-huh . 
B|137| M: He's [, uh ,] living _in [a_ little] place called Planos . 
A|138| A: There's [, uh _,] maybe_ some short-term [things] [that] [they] _can do_ [and] [it] hurts everybody's pocket , [of] course [, but] , um [, I] [know] [that] [state] [has] [, uh ,] cutback [, uh ,] raises [for] [a] year [to] [help] [, uh ,] [the] [, uh ,] [state] financial or whatever [you] might want [to] [say] [to] [get] better [in a] better condition . 
B|139| M: [Oh ,] _cool_ . 
A|140| A: [and [,] uh ,] they'll find [something] [like that] [and] just absolutely sit glued [to] [it [,] [I] [,] you know [,] I] keep telling _them_ [it's] [the same] mentality [you know , and] something's [wrong [,] and [,] uh [,] but] [, uh [,] and] [we] very seldom watch television _on_ [a] Friday night or Saturday night , because _we're_ [not] [home] 
B|141| M:  
A|142| A: [and] _we're_ spending _on_ these useless , [many] times useless [and] inordinately complex unnecessary tests [in] hospitals [for] [older] [people .] 
B|143| M: [It was] 
A|144| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|145| M: Nope . Just [don't know what] [to] _use_ [it] [on] . 
A|146| A: [Yeah _.] [I_ think] _one_ [thing] [that] _maybe_ would [help] [people] vote _is_ [if] [the] polls [were] either open more days , or [you] could mail [it] [in] , or [something] _like ,_ [if] [you have] , [if] [you have] real strict work hours _, and _you_ can_ only [go] [like] [at] seven [in the] morning or after work _and [you_ have to] stand [in] line [for] so [long] 
B|147| M: [I'm] [not] [, but] [I'm] [the] [one] who's asking . 
A|148| A: Uh-huh . 
B|149| M: _Because_ [, you know ,] he's [not] . 
A|150| A: Uh-huh . 
B|151| M: It's [, uh , uh] [like _,] [that_ [,] that's _,] that_ 
A|152| A: [Yeah] [, that's [,] uh ,] spare [time] , [with] [a] child [it's] , kind [of] [she's] , [we] [have] [, uh _,] we're_ looking [for] [a] baby-sitter so we've [been] _out_ twice [in] [in] [this] year so far . By ourselves [without] [the] child 
B|153| M: _Well [,_ I] am 
A|154| A: [and they] [can] actually [use] as _much_ recycled paper as [the] community _can get_ _to them ._ [Because] _they are_ actually buying [it] [and] shipping [it] [in] from outside . 
B|155| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] [, maybe] [you know] 
A|156| A: _That_ [still] does [it [,] that's] [right .] 
B|157| M: This [is] [how] [it] works [. If [you] [have] enough] [money] [, [you] have] [the] [money] [to] buy [something .] 
A|158| A: [Oh .] Now does , does [the] [school in] , [in] your , [in] your city , does [it ,] does [it] offer , [like] band , or some [of the] instruments ? 
B|159| M:  ... [I don't know] . 
A|160| A: Uh-huh . 
B|161| M: He _said_ _, and then [,_ I] . 
A|162| A: Uh-huh . 
B|163| M: [That] [, and you] [, [and ,] and] ... 
A|164| A: Five hundred dollars [a] week . For two kids . 
B|165| M: uuh [, uh ,] charge [, they] pay , charge 
A|166| A: [And] [there] [was] [a] paper presented [at] [this] conference from [a] guy from Alabama [and] [he was] kind [of] hired [to do] [a] study _by_ two departments [for] [the] government . One [was] [like ,] environmental protection [and] [the] [other] [one] [was ,] oh [, I can't] remember [what] [, but] [the] basic idea , _it was_ presented [to] him [was] [how] [can] [we] maximize [the] amount [of] energy [that] [we] _can get_ back from recycling [and] minimize [the] volume [of] stuff [that] [we] [are] putting into our landfill 
B|167| M: [The] problem [is that] [they're] [probably] [not] trying [it] [out] [in a] [home] . 
A|168| A: Um , no _, not_ [right] [now .] 
B|169| M: [Is] [it] [a] breeding problem ? 
A|170| A: [Oh ,] _it is_ Japanese . 
B|171| M: [You [don't] have] any proof . 
A|172| A: But [they have] [, I] read somewhere [, and] [I'm] [, I'm] [out] [on] [a] limb [here] , some type [of] college [, uh ,] volunteer work [for] teachers [, that] _they are_ straight [out] [of] college [and they] [do] [one] year [of] volunteer work teaching [in the] [, uh ,] lower income brackets [of the] United States . Have [you] ever heard [about] [that] [one] ? 
B|173| M: [I've] [been] [to _a] few_ [of them] [, [they] are] [pretty good .] 
A|174| A: [Yeah] [, you] [do] [a] lot more area than [I] [do] . [I've] , all [the] rest [of] _my_ yard , backyard [is] [, uh [,] you know ,] pool [and] decking [it's] all [the] dirt [I] [have] , left [in] _my_ backyard 
B|175| M: Wait . Wait . Wait . Wait . Wait . wait . 
A|176| A: [Well [,] it's] _got_ [a] [, a] very small furnace . 
B|177| M: [I've] [been] [to _a] few_ weddings [, [they] were] [great] . 
A|178| A: Wow . 
B|179| M: [We _have] [a_ cat] . 
A|180| A: [Uh] [, and] [how] , [how] _do you_ feel [about] [, uh ,] let's see , eye _care_ ? 
B|181| M:  ... 
A|182| A: so [, it's] [okay .] 
B|183| M: Ah [. I] _didn't_ [get] [that .] 
A|184| A: [And , uh [,] and] yet [if] [you] [didn't] feel [like you] could [be] [a] [good] caretaker [I don't] [, uh [,] [it's] a] very , very hard decision [I think .] 
B|185| M: [I like] _to eat_ [it] [with my] 
A|186| A: People [get] shipped off [and then [,] you know [, and] then [,] and then] their parents [, I] [have a] [, uh [,] a] [, a] friend whose , whose son [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala , or daughter [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala [right] [now .] 
B|187| M: Aye [, I'm [in] the] US . 
A|188| A: Uh-huh [. Yeah .] 
B|189| M: [Is that] _how [they_ are] ? 
A|190| A: Might make [you] feel better [but] 
B|191| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] [, [but] [I think] [it] was] [to them .] 
A|192| A: [That] would [be] , certainly [be] [a] deterrent . 
B|193| M: [I'm] ... 
A|194| A: [Yeah .] 
B|195| M: [So] [what] [do you] [think] [is] [the] ideal outcome ? 
A|196| A: Sure . 
B|197| M: It's [a] girl 
A|198| A: [Well ,] [there] [is] so [many] chances [for] appeal [, that] [it] 
B|199| M:  ... 
A|200| A: [and] [how they] just well , [it] hasn't [been] just [but] [it was] [in the] [, I think] [the] second or third quarter [of] last year , nineteen ninety 
B|201| M: [I] [mean] [, you] [can't] really'use'it [for [that] .] 
A|202| A: But [I] [have] _fun_ doing [it ,] some [, uh [,] you know [,] I] [have] some [good] shots [and] some [bad] shots . 
B|203| M: s . 
A|204| A: _yeah [,_ I've] [done] [it] before [and] [when] [I was] [in] [in] high [school] [and] college [, and] thoroughly enjoyed [it ,] 
B|205| M: [I love] [them] [, but] [they are] [too] short [for] [me] 
A|206| A: [Well ,] _yeah [,_ they don't] [like] [it] [in] [here] because there's nothing [to eat] 
B|207| M: [So] ... [what's] [the] difference between [them] ? 
A|208| A: [I'm sure] [that's] fine . [I'm [sure] .] Maybe [we] ought [to] just start carving [in] stone again . 
B|209| M: [not] . 
A|210| A: Right [, right .] 
B|211| M:  
A|212| A: [Well _,] not_ [the] rain so _much_ as [the] [cool] , [the] [other] mornings [when] [it was] [like] sixty-five [when] [we] woke [up] [and] sixty-six [, and] today [I] [know] [when] [I] _got_ [up] _that the_ temperature [said] more [like ,] close , seventy-nine or eighty 
B|213| M: [I] [mean] [, [you] [can] do] [that] anyway . 
A|214| A: [Yeah .] But [then] [when] [you're] , [when] [you're] picked , see [I was] picked [for] another murder trial before 
B|215| M: He [didn't] [say] [he was] . 
A|216| A: Go ahead . 
B|217| M: Do [you [know] what] crimes [are] committed [by] [people] using [it ?] 
A|218| A: [Yeah .] 
B|219| M: [I think [it] _is] ._ 
A|220| A: uh-huh . 
B|221| M: [So ,] [what] [you're] saying [is [that] the] [people] [that] [were] [involved] [with the] bombing [are] [the] ones who [got] [the] [death] sentence ? 
A|222| A: Uh-huh . 
B|223| M: [Yes] [, we're] [in the] middle [of the] US . 
A|224| A: [Yeah] [, that's] [pretty] [out] [there] . _What_ , well , 
B|225| M: [What] [do you mean] , [you're] losing [me] ? 
A|226| A: _No , not_ [in] _, not_ [in] well [not] [in] Dallas [, that] [is .] 
B|227| M: Uhm ... 
A|228| A: [Yeah .] 
B|229| M: [Well] _yeah [._ I] [mean] [, it's] [pretty] [much] _a [right_ .]

B|231| M: [Are you] 
A|232| A: [So ,] 
B|233| M: i 
A|234| A: [That's] [about the] only real bonus
