B|47| M: How long [do] [you] [think the] season will [last] ? 
A|48| A: [I think] it's _because_ [he's] always heard music [in] our [home] all [the ,] since he [was] [a] baby . 
B|49| M: Yes [, [and] , you] . 
A|50| A: _Yeah_ , it's , it's made very clear upon hiring .

B|57| M: You [are] [in the] area ? 
A|58| A: [I have] _, so_ [I _have] to_ take [that] into consideration when [I] evaluate like how [much] [I] _get_ paid [you _know] _,_ because_ if [I was] working somewhere else I'd _have to_ [, [you] _know] ,_ [pay] an extra five percent , or [so] . 
B|59| M: Golden Retriever . 
A|60| A: [Well ,] [for the] past week or two it's _been_ cold [and] wet 
B|61| M: [Oh] ? 
A|62| A: They're able [to] move [in] _while_ they're still independent [and] still social 
B|63| M:  
A|64| A: _Yeah_ this [is] , it's like [a] duplex , like [a] two by two [they] call [it] like [in] Pittsburgh . 
B|65| M: She [was] . 
A|66| A: No thanks . [That's] [right] . 
B|67| M: [I] can't , can't 
A|68| A: [Oh] _, yeah ._ [That's] [good] . Actually , 
B|69| M: [I think] [, uh ,] I'll try [to] [get] [out [of] the] [house] [and] spend [some] [time] [with] her . 
A|70| A: Instead [of] being carried 
B|71| M: [They] [, uh ,] [have] [a] [family] 
A|72| A: Uh-huh . [I think] _that's_ [right] , 
B|73| M: [I'm] [in] Australia . 
A|74| A: everybody seems [to be] [, you] can tell [some] [of the] newscasters when [they] like [the] heat _, because_ they'll talk [about it] being [so] gorgeous on those days when we're melting [, and] [you] can tell when [they] talk [about] beautiful weather [some] mornings when we're , it'll [be] too cold [, and] they'll say , well those [are] [the] ones [that] like [the] cold weather . 
B|75| M: [Yeah .] 
A|76| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . _And_ , [is] _your_ mother still living ? 
B|77| M: [And then] ? 
A|78| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] Right . It used [to be] [that] we _were_ , [that] we _were_ trying [to] protect morality . Now it's we're protecting our lives . [It's a] it's [a] [much] different , 
B|79| M: [It's a] bit over 2 . 5 million [, so] [that's] [a] [pretty] [good] deal . 
A|80| A: [Oh] [I've] _I've been_ lots [of] places . My [last] vacation [was] [actually] [in] Morocco [I] guess we , [that] _one_ _would_ count , 
B|81| M: What's [your] point ? 
A|82| A: [And] _I would_ _never_ [do] [it .] [I] [I] love this country too [much] [, and] [that] symbol means [a] lot [to] me . 
B|83| M: [I'm] sorry [for] [your] 
A|84| A: [Yeah .] 
B|85| M: You're welcome 
A|86| A: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: You [have to] . 
A|88| A: [Yeah .] 
B|89| M: Yes [, because] [the] [people] who [were] arrested [are] guilty [of] murder . 
A|90| A: [I mean] [I don't] like guns [in] general [but] when [I think] [about] [, uh ,] this topic like capital [punishment] [I] look at somebody [, I mean [,] I] just remember when [I [was] in] college [in a] dorm [and] [I think] if he'd _been_ around _one_ [of] my [family] members probably _would have_ killed him [but] [in] Florida [, in _the] state_ [of] Washington when [they] had [the] Ted Bundy case 
B|91| M: [I'm] [down] , [I've been] looking [for] [a] [place to] live [for] [a] [while] [now] . 
A|92| A: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [I [would] have] guessed [a] game _called_ mahjongg 
A|94| A: But , 
B|95| M: i [know .] 
A|96| A: Wow , you're , [a] pro at this . 
B|97| M: You [know , the] [one] [time] [a] girl [was] elected [to] [the state] legislature [, and] she [was] [found] [not] guilty [of] [anything] . 
A|98| A: Uh , one's [real] nice [, but] [the] other [one] [is] [a] , well , she's [pretty] wild . 
B|99| M: Uhh , where's [the] rest [of the] world ? 
A|100| A: Uh-huh 
B|101| M: [We don't] , [that's] why . 
A|102| A: Uh-huh . 
B|103| M: You [know [,] I] [never] [said [I] was] . 
A|104| A: [Yeah .] [I mean [,] and] [and] [in the ,] once [you] junior high [, uh ,] start junior high , starting [in] eighth grade all [the] way through high school , there [were] four levels . [Well ,] no [, I] guess [it] [in] junior high , [it] [was] still three . Then [in] high school [it] changed into four levels [of] [, uh ,] [of] instruction [in the] major subjects . Uh , which , 
B|105| M: [I do] [, uh [,] uh] 
A|106| A: Um . 
B|107| M: Hehehe [, yeah .] 
A|108| A: That [was] [really] [called] roughing [it] [, yeah .] [I] , Anymore . [Yeah] , see
