B|45| M: What [are] [you] [talking] [about] ? 
A|46| A: It gives [you] confidence . In _my_ business if [I] call [on the] [the] J C Penney company here [in] Dallas or [say] someone [say] Sears _and_ Roebuck [in] Chicago , [then] [I] wear coat _and_ tie .

B|47| M: What [are] [you] doing ? 
A|48| A: _and_ these _kids_ _, um_ , [you] [know] , every girl [I] taught , except for one , [was] pregnant . 
B|49| M: Uhhh [, I think] [you] [mean] [we] weren't _even_ _a family_ [, uh ,] before [you] . 
A|50| A: Huh . 
B|51| M: [She] looks [like] _a great_ mom . 
A|52| A: _Yeah ,_ _yeah ._ Me neither . [And] , [you] wonder , [you] [know] [, what] kind _of_ quality job _would_ _they_ [do] , [you] [know] , Just sit around for _their_ year , 
B|53| M: [I] am [so] confused . 
A|54| A: Oh _my_ gosh . People [are] crazy . 
B|55| M: _So_ [what] [do] [you] [think] [of the] relationship between Rome [and] New York ? 
A|56| A: Yep . [And] [then] , [you] [know] , if [you] can put your _cocoa_ [in] with your cornstarch if [you] wanted [to] . [The] _cocoa_ [even] seems [to] thicken [it] [even] more . 
B|57| M: Uhhhh [, I think] . 
A|58| A: but [it] seems [like] here [, I] _would_ [like] [it] [to] rain [and] [then] _be_ over , [and] [then] [not] rain for [a] while . It seems [like] when [it] gets stuck [in] [a] rain pattern , that's all [it] does . 
B|59| M: [It's] [a] shame [they don't] [see] [it] [that] way . 
A|60| A: [And] [they] thought [they] were getting [a great] deal _, um_ , because [they] could _get_ [a] five hundred thousand dollar home with , [they] call [it] , zero lot lines , no property , [And] _it would_ make [you] ill [to] [see] [this] . 
B|61| M:  ... 
A|62| A: _You_ [go] [in] _their_ bathroom [and] there's ten tooth brushes [in] there . [And] [I] always give her [a] _hard_ time whose toothbrush [did] [you] really use [this] morning 
B|63| M: [The] [kids] [are] [the] best feeders . 
A|64| A: [Well ,] [that] _is_ interesting . Right . 
B|65| M: [I] [like] [the] weather . 
A|66| A: [Well ,] _my_ wife [and] [I] [and] we've got [a] thirteen week old baby [so] [don't] [do] much cooking for him yet . 
B|67| M: Aesthetic [is] [the] most important [part of] [a] treatment . 
A|68| A: _Yeah ,_ that's [good .] [Well ,] one [of] _my_ favorites if [I don't] want [to] [have] _other_ _people_ bring stuff [, I] [just] want [to] treat them [is] [to] make chicken [and] rice . 
B|69| M: [They] should [get] [their] own [college] credit . 
A|70| A: _We_ [have] got [about] [, uh ,] twenty , I'd [say] [about] twenty-four hundred . 
B|71| M: He laughs [. Yeah [,] I think] [so] . 
A|72| A: There's [not] , there [is] [not a] whole lot [of] , [you] [know] , funded research _from_ , 
B|73| M: [It's] [not] [even] [cocoa] powder [. It's] chocolate . 
A|74| A: _I can't_ remember [a] year when [we] didn't [have] one [of] some kind . 
B|75| M: [They] 
A|76| A: [But] [very] true [to] life [, I mean [,] I've] seen [our] [family] [in] several [of] those situations 
B|77| M: Ah . Cool . 
A|78| A: _Yeah ._ Uh-huh . [So] as [a family] [you] all [just] visited nursing homes or probably [in] College Station there wasn't [a] whole lot [of] choice . 
B|79| M:  
A|80| A: [it] [is] _hard_ [. It's] [, uh ,] [like] anything else whether or [not] [you] want [to] sacrifice another half hour . 
B|81| M: [Well] [yeah .] 
A|82| A: [That's] [the] last thing [you] want , [to do .] 
B|83| M: [Well [,] I'm] [from] Australia [. I'm] [not] [going] [to] [be] able [to] [go] [to] any [other] countries _, so_ [I] guess [it would] [be] fun . 
A|84| A: Oh , really . 
B|85| M:  
A|86| A: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: [You] . 
A|88| A: Oh , except [the] kid , huh , that's , 
B|89| M: Why ? 
A|90| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|91| M: [So] 
A|92| A: [I ,] 
B|93| M: [We] should [have a] separate food truck . 
A|94| A: Oh [, [I] know] [we'll] [have] [to] stay home [and] mow [the] yard 
B|95| M: Uhh [, um] . Yes . 
A|96| A: Oh . 
B|97| M: ' 
A|98| A: Okay , [have a] [good] night . All right , bye-bye . 
B|99| M: Umm ...? 
A|100| A: [I] wonder how many [of] his lives _he_ missed , when [that] happened . 
B|101| M: Uhh [, what] [did] [he] expect ? 
A|102| A: [I don't know] [that] [it] does . [I [,] [I] ,] [don't know] [that] [, um] , if [you] step back [from] [the] current issue [and] look at [it] more intellectually , there [are] forever over , as long as [we] [know] there [are] races _of people_ [that] [are] dropping out . 
B|103| M:  
A|104| A: Every time [he] turns around [I'm] giving him some new rule , where [you're] supposed [to] squish up [the] , [you] [know] , [like] collapse [the] plastic jugs . Instead [of] taking them up there solid . 
B|105| M: [It's] [a] German Shepherd _, so_ [it's] [a] breed . 
A|106| A: [Yeah ,] that's , that's [what] ours [are] too . 
B|107| M: [You] [mean] [I can't] build [my] own recyclables ? 
A|108| A: [And] [, uh [,] so] [they] cancelled [that] one [and] [, uh ,] [are] looking next year bringing [it] back closer , but [we] [have a] letter , [a family] letter , [that] circulates , 
B|109| M: How's [it] [going] ? 
A|110| A: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: Why [would] anyone donate [to] [a] charity ? 
A|112| A: Uh-huh , well [you] , 
B|113| M:  
B|114| M: [I] guess [. Yeah .] Its [a] [little] [hard to] explain [. They] [are] [like] [a] small group [of people] .
