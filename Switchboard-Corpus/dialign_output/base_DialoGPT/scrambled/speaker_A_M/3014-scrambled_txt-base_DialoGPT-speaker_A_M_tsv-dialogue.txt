B|65| M: [I'm] [not] sure [if] [it's] [a] choice [or] [not] . 
A|66| A: [I think] [was] [the] last [time] [I] [was] up , up [there] [and] at Center Park . 
B|67| M: [I think] _it was_ [a] joke . 
A|68| A: _And_ [the] side [that's] [on] [the] _, uh ,_ [the] other side _is_ [about] six feet high . 
B|69| M: Friends , [right] _. But [,_ uh _,] we_ [are] [, uh] .. 
A|70| A: I'd [be] [, _I] mean_ I'd [be] tried by [a] jury [of] [you know] , people _who_ had nothing else [to] [do] [and] weren't very knowledgeable [about] certain sorts [of] things , [and] [, uh [,] [I] don't know] , 
B|71| M: _I know_ [they] [are] blooming _, but_ [they] [are] still growing . 
A|72| A: _And_ [so] , _one_ day [I] got up [and] [thought] [well] [I] will [just] [go] casual [and] [you know] [that] [I] called [on] [a] guy wearing exactly _that ,_ bib overalls , [and] he sort [of] told me [that] he expected me [to] [be] professional 
B|73| M: [Yeah , _I] [know_ .] 
A|74| A: _And_ [you] _don't want to_ ? 
B|75| M: [Yeah [,] uh ,] she's [not] dead 
A|76| A: [Do you] [like] [to] cook ?

A|78| A: Really ? 
B|79| M: [Oh [,] _you] mean_ [that ,] 
A|80| A: [Well ,] then , um , 
B|81| M: No [. I] [want to] _see_ [the] eggs hatch 
A|82| A: [So] [that's] [a] difficult situation . 
B|83| M:  
A|84| A: Or maybe [it's] only half hour . Um [, you] [just] , until [the] rice looks fluffy , [and] [and] [not] overdone . You [know] , before [it] gets overdone . 
B|85| M: [Yes .] 
A|86| A: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: No . It [was] [a] joke . 
A|88| A: [Well ,] [there] [are] [a] lot [of] things [that] people [, I think] general , 
B|89| M: Good luck [with] [that .] 
A|90| A: [But ,] unemployment now [in] Dallas , [or] [in] Texas _is_ up around six [point] , 
B|91| M: i [used] [to] eat [that] stuff . Tis [a] _good_ source [of] vitamin c 
A|92| A: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: Where [is] [that] ? 
A|94| A: Uh-huh . 
B|95| M: _I don't _,_ but [I_ do] [like] spaghetti 
A|96| A: Uh-huh . 
B|97| M: _I mean [,_ it's] [just] chicken . 
A|98| A: _That is_ odd [. I] [was] drug tested [, uh ,] [not] [for] [the] job [I have] now [, but] [for] [the] prior job [, uh [,] but [I] know] [that] [they] sent , [that] [the] job [I] had before , [that [,] well] , [the] job [I have] , [have] now , requested my [, uh [,] uh ,] my [, uh ,] medical record from my [old] company 
B|99| M: Uhh 
A|100| A: [Yeah] 
B|101| M: No ... 
A|102| A: Local [you mean] ? 
B|103| M: That's 
A|104| A: [I don't ,] oh , plus [, [I] mean ,] [the] pooper scooper [one] New York [, so] [, [you] know .] 
B|105| M: [That [is] [,] uh ,] interesting . 
A|106| A: Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: Goodbye [to] [you] [too] 
A|108| A: [Yeah ,] [with] [, uh ,] [with] our current [, uh ,] organization [, we] [do] [have] [a] nice retirement package [and] also [a] _, a_ nice thing [that ,] [that] [we] [have] [in] our corporation [is] [a] [, uh ,] [is] [a] profit sharing plan where [we] can [, uh ,] participate [in the] , [the] profits [of the] company . If we're [, [you] know] , [if] we've [been] [there] [a while] [and] we're vested [, uh ,] which means [that [,] [you] know] [, we] [have] [a] , an interest [, uh ,] [in the] company [that] [we] can [, uh ,] get [some of the] benefits [of the] , either [the] profit high times [or] , [or] [in] [a] sense , suffer during [the] low times 
B|109| M:  
A|110| A: [Well ,] [that's] probably true . 
B|111| M:  
A|112| A: Huh . 
B|113| M: [I [don't] want to] [make] [any] promises [, but] [I'm] [going to] take [a] bath [with] [a] bath . 
A|114| A: [Well ,] those [are] skills [that] she certainly [is] [going to] need early [on] [and] [, [you] know] , [the] , [and] [it] seems [like] [it's] getting earlier [and] earlier _with the_ children . 
B|115| M: What's [the] music ? 
A|116| A: Uh , [and] [if] , [and] [if] [that's] [the] only way [that] will , [it] will [make] [you] save [and] [have] _a little_ nest egg at [the] end [of the] , [the] year then doggone [it] [that's] [what] [you] should [do] . 
B|117| M: [I mean [,] I'm [a] little] nervous [about] [the] weather [too] . 
A|118| A: You [know] , [and] [I'm] [, I'm] thinking woman , wake up [and] smell [the] roses before [they] come [and] get [you] [. But] ... 
B|119| M: Why ? What's [the] [point] ? 
A|120| A: [Well ,] he could always get past [, [you] know] , he'd get past [like] six [or] seven tackles [and] [just] keep spinning around [and] get [on] into [the] end zone [. But ,] um [, I] guess [you] never could really [see] him play , because _with the_ Cowboys , [while] he [was] _with the_ team , _the rest [of_ the] team [was] pretty poor [so] [you] couldn't really tell [if] [it was] [just] him [or] [the] team [and] [I] always [just] assumed [that] he [was] [too] [good] [for] _the rest [of_ the] team [. But [,] [I] don't know .] 
B|121| M: No [, [they] were] bred [for] temperament . 
A|122| A: My word . 
B|123| M:  ... 
A|124| A: [Well] . 
B|125| M: Why [do] [that .] 
A|126| A: Wow 
B|127| M: [It's] [the] show . 
A|128| A: _And_ [, I] guess even back [to] Kennedy , as [a] [matter] [of] fact [, I] guess Kennedy may [be] [the one] [that] actually started [the] thing , [or] [was] [, [you] know] , really interested [in] things [like] [that .] 
B|129| M: Weep . 
A|130| A: [But [,] I] got [to] [do] more , more fun things . 
B|131| M: Uhuh [. And] ? 
A|132| A: Right , [and] [, [you] know] [, we] [can't] really depend [on] [the] police [to] solve all [this] [, they] [just] [can't] [do] [it] . 
B|133| M: What [are] [you] [, a] historian ? 
A|134| A: [Yeah ,] [the] [, uh ,] [the] B M W [is] really , oh , [like] , oh [, we] [have] all these [like] high tech things [and] everything [is] put together [with] exacting tolerances [and] , [and] then [you] [go] [to] Porsche [and] [it's] [like] [, well] [, uh ,] these cars [are] completely handmade 
B|135| M: Good luck [with [the] rest [of] course] ?
