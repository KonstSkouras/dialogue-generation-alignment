A|4| A: Uh-huh . 
B|5| M: _That's_ [what] I'm saying , [the] prices _are_ _usually_ higher than [the] cost [of the] game .

B|15| M: My plan _is_ [to] wake me _up_ earlier . 
A|16| A: _Well_ , they _do_ treat paper _with_ chemicals _like_ yellow paper , [you] _know_ takes something _like_ twenty times as long [to] decompose .

A|18| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|19| M:  ... 
A|20| A: Wow , yeah . 
B|21| M: [Yeah] 
A|22| A: _Well_ , not being _a_ drug user [I don't] _have a_ problem _with_ [that] personally 
B|23| M: [I] was [the] [one] _who_ made [the _,] uh ,_ first mistake .

B|25| M: [You] [have a] _nice_ yard . 
A|26| A: _Well_ , _it_ sounds _like_ [you] , you've got your hands full 
B|27| M: Because [the] media _is_ biased . Not [the] case [with] [the] elections _. But_ [we] [do] [have] elections . They [are] very important . So . Do . They . Like . [it] . Much . Much more . 
A|28| A: Right . Right . And [you] [usually] _get_ [what] [you] pay [for] . [We] bought [some] walkie-talkies [a] couple [of] years ago [for] Christmas , and they were _like_ ten _dollars_ , and [we] _expected_ them [to] work [nice] [for] [the] little kids , and they didn't work worth anything 
B|29| M: [You know ,] _there_ [are] [some] [things] _that are_ better than this [, like] [the] way [the] government works . 
A|30| A: Money from , money [for] taking care [of the] infants takes money away from taking care [of the] elderly , _or_ [do] they both _get_ served ? Uh , that's [a] good point . 
B|31| M: [I] [have] 
A|32| A: Oh , _boy_ [, I] bet [all] [the] men [that] got direct down [there] were just right on [it] 
B|33| M: [It's] more close than [I] [expected] . 
A|34| A: [I think] [the only] people [who] benefit from [that are] [the] lawyers . 
B|35| M:  ... [what] [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|36| A: [we] [have] found [state] parks , not [that] they're lacking _but_ [, uh ,] they're certainly not [up] [to] [a] standard [of] [a] K O A where _it's_ , [you] [know ,] [a] little bit cleaner . You've got [the] showers available . [It's] not , [you] [know ,] _in_ [the] same category .

[That's] [the only] time [you] really use your campground . If [you're] going [to] [be] gone [all] day long , walking someplace _or_ [doing] tourism _or_ whatever [uh ,] [you're] camping really [is] just [for] [like] _in_ [the] evening [to] start [the] fire , [to] sit back and watch [a] fire [, uh ,] [to] enjoy [that] , [you] [know ,] and then [to] _get_ [up] _in_ [the] morning and _get_ [a] shower and _get_ cleaned [up] , [that] kind [of] stuff . 
B|37| M: Yes , [of] , [have] 
A|38| A: [I] see 
B|39| M: [I] was [in] China 
A|40| A: Oh , really ? 
B|41| M: [I think] [it] was 
A|42| A: Just hadn't heard much about them lately . 
B|43| M: So [, it's] [the] US ? 
A|44| A: [you] want [to] , [Yeah] . They'll let [you] work , decrease your number [of] hours by any percentage just , just about [so] if [you] want [to] _get_ your masters and then [, [I] think] [of] course [you] _get_ [like] [a] , [with] your extra degrees [you] _get_ [a] pay raise due [so] [that] will probably help out . 
B|45| M: [Well] I'm [a] [boy] scout . 
A|46| A: Are [you] ? 
B|47| M: I'll [have] [to] check [when I] [get] home [, but [I] think] it'll [be] around three [or] five [dollars] .
