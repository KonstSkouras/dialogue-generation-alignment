A|54| A: [have a] _good_ weekend . 
B|55| M: _That's_ why [they] call [it] [a] bag . 
A|56| A: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] and] there's _, uh ,_ there's [a lot] [of] people here [in] Baltimore [that] _, uh ,_ [have] [and] we [just] [had] _, uh ,_ [a] real big cocaine bust [, and] [of] course _, you_ [know ,] they're , they're playing [it] up real big [that] [it] [was] , looked [like it] [was] [a] _very_ , _very_ _small_ ring [and] [they] [just] [happened to] get lucky [and] catch _the guy_ . 
B|57| M: Cooked chocolate [is] [so] [good] 
A|58| A: [I've] heard all these stories [about] [, I] travel extensively [and] spend _, uh ,_ maybe [half] [a] year [in] Europe every year , 
B|59| M: [I'm not] _even_ [a] girl . 
A|60| A: They're pretty neat _little_ , [I've never seen] _one ._ 
B|61| M:  
A|62| A: [Well] , basically [, yeah] [I] [had] [to] [do] [, that] _, uh [,_ the] same _, uh ,_ [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year . [I] [mean] _uh ,_ because [I was] _in a_ , _in a_ position [of] management [I] [had] responsibilities over people [that] _, uh [,_ I] needed [to] make my schedule _, uh ,_ [so] [that] if [I was] [not] [there] [I] _would_ [have] coverage by some other management personnel , 
B|63| M: [I] didn't [feel] _anything_ 
A|64| A: [You know [,] it's] [, [I] think] [it's] _very_ difficult [in _the] first_ [place] [to] make [that] choice [to] [have] them [go] [there .] 
B|65| M: He's _been_ gone [for a] while 
A|66| A: [Yeah] . [That's] [right .] [I'm not] limited [to] , [just] mowing [it] on Saturday morning _, you_ [know ,] 
B|67| M: What's wrong _with_ classical music ? 
A|68| A: [Yeah] . 
B|69| M: Hey _, [that's_ [the] guy] [who] shot [the] police officer [that] shot [the guy] [in the] 
A|70| A: Uh , what _are_ [you] thinking [about] buying ? 
B|71| M: Uhh [, uh [,] uh] . [we're] [not] [in a] basement 
A|72| A: Which [, uh ,] _kind of_ taco turkey loaf . It [was] [good] . Uh , scalloped potatoes . 
B|73| M: Not _really_ . 
A|74| A: [and] as [a] matter [of] fact , [I've] already done [a] second row [of] radishes . 
B|75| M: _What_ [are] [they] ? 
A|76| A: Uh-huh . 
B|77| M:  , [I'm] sorry . 
A|78| A: [Well] , _it _is_ [,_ the] hardest thing [I've] ever done , as _much_ as you'd [go] [out] 
B|79| M: [I] read [that .] 
A|80| A: Uh-huh . Right . Uh-huh . Right , because they're [a] danger [to] everybody else . Huh [, that's] interesting . _I have_ [to] [, uh] agree [with] [that .] 
B|81| M: [I] can't , 
A|82| A: With [the company] than , than having [to] [go] , [That's] [, that's [right] .] _Yes [,_ I] , agree [with] [that .] 
B|83| M: congrats . 
A|84| A: And [, uh ,] [so] , we [had] [to] make some adjustments because we [really] [are] _kind of_ looking [for] something [that] we want [to] [do] [and] [he] wants [to] [do] [that's] satisfactory [, and] we've [been] here seven [months] [and] he's [still] hasn't hit up on [anything] permanently . 
B|85| M: [I [have] a] bit , I' 
A|86| A: Probably , um [, uh ,] let's see [, I] [like] [the] looks [of the] Lincoln Town _car_ 
B|87| M: yes . 
A|88| A: A [lot] [of] people [say] [it] doesn't matter where [they] [live] if [they] [have a] nice house [and] [, but] [I] disagree [with] [that] [, I] . 
B|89| M: Where [in] Pittsburgh ? 
A|90| A: [I] [mean] , if your going [to] sentence somebody , let's [say] twenty years , let them stay twenty years . 
B|91| M: [Yes [,] you] [can] 
A|92| A: Right . In my , my [, uh ,] father's family , we get together every year at [a] different location , either Dallas or Oklahoma City . They [had] chosen Santa Barbara , California [for] [this] summer [and] [, and] did [not] get enough people [that] were willing [to] [go] [that] far , because most [of] us [live] either [in the] midwest , or [like] [in the] Texas , Oklahoma area . 
B|93| M:  ... 
A|94| A: They , [they] [went to] all , all ... 
B|95| M: _What kind of_ food [do you] [think] [would be] [best] ? 
A|96| A: That [is the] reason [, [I] don't] play over [there .] 
B|97| M: [the] . 
A|98| A: We [don't] [even] [have] _any_ concrete or asphalt . 
B|99| M: [How] [much] [do you] [think] [it is] ? 
A|100| A: [Oh] , [how] funny . 
B|101| M: [You] [don't] seem [very] threatening . 
A|102| A: [Yeah [,] [I] think] [so] too . [I] [know] our grass needs mowing twice as often [when] [it] rains 
B|103| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|104| A: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: _It's_ , [is [,] uh ,] [is] 
A|106| A: [Yes] 
B|107| M: [You] [think] ? 
A|108| A: Uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [I'm] [a] [kid] . 
A|110| A: [It's] enough space [for] two people [Yeah] . 
B|111| M: He [was] also [the] next generation . 
A|112| A: [but] [I don't like] using them because [I've] [seen] too many people [that] used them [and] ended up bankrupt or on , chapter thirteen [and] stuff _like [that_ .] 
B|113| M: [It's] [been] [like that] since [the first] [day] 
A|114| A: [Yeah [,] I] guess [so] [that's] [true .] [Yeah] . 
B|115| M: [How] [about] [an] E ? 
A|116| A: [Yeah] . [I] guess [you] [know] enough [to] look where [you're] walking or sitting or whatever [you're] [doing] . 
B|117| M: [Oh] [no ,] [not] [you] . 
A|118| A: [I] did [a lot] [of] [just] going [out] by myself [and] riding on [the] subway [and] watching people . 
B|119| M: [No .] 
A|120| A: [Oh] [, yeah] ? [What kind of] programs [do you] , 
B|121| M: [It's] [just] [a] [little] bit [of a] pain . 
A|122| A: Uh-huh . 
B|123| M: Who's [the] team ? 
A|124| A: Sounds [like] [a lot] [of] money though 
B|125| M: He [was] [the] last [one [,] but] [he] [was] [only] [there] [for a] couple [of] days . 
A|126| A: [Well] , we were [there] [when] [they] [had a] 
B|127| M: [It's] [a] [small] [one .] 
A|128| A: Um . 
B|129| M: [It's] why . 
A|130| A: [Yeah [,] that's] what we buy [the] most [of] , unless [we're] going on [a] trip or something where we want [to] , put [the] cans [in a] cooler 
B|131| M: [You] 
A|132| A: Right . [Yeah] . Uh huh . 
B|133| M: [yeah] ,? 
A|134| A: Uh-huh . 
B|135| M: [I] can't find [any] stick shift [car] [that] has [a] manual transmission .
