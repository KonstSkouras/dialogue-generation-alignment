B|21| M: _Oh ,_ uhuh ? 
A|22| A: [I'm] building my own house . 
B|23| M: How [do] _they_ [get] [to the] other side ?

B|25| M: They _are_ ... 
A|26| A: _Uh_ [, but] yeah , [that] _was_ [, I] highly recommend [that] way [to] go . If [you're] ever interested _in_ going [the] route [, I] dealt with _this_ woman , her name _was_ Rita at China Tours _in_ Boston 
B|27| M: [I] [have] [been] [in] Morocco [and] [there] [was] [a lot of] [people] [there] .

B|39| M: [I'm] sorry 
A|40| A: And they're , they're incredible victims [of] crime . And part [of] [it] _is_ _this_ lack [of] , lack [of] basic information , being dissimilated . And [I'm not] saying _it's_ easy [to] [do] , [and] [I] [know] [there] _are a few_ [people] who [are] trying [, but [,] but] [the] funding isn't [there] _for_ very much work [to] [be] going [on] . 
B|41| M: You [can't] [say] [that .]
