B|29| M: [That] . [about] . [it] . [it] 
A|30| A: [I] [, I] [know] , but [it] , it's , it's , uh , easier on [the] patient in [the] long run , which amazed me . 
B|31| M: Good morning , sir . 
A|32| A: I've done [a] little , [a] lot _of_ different kinds , but [I] [, I] [just] [know] right now [that] [I] couldn't have put out half _of_ [what] [I] did if [that] much without [the] being in computers so that's been really great . And , uh , [I'm] , so [I'm] _real_ spoiled . 
B|33| M: I'd [like] [to] [see] [a] picture [of] [a] [real] job
