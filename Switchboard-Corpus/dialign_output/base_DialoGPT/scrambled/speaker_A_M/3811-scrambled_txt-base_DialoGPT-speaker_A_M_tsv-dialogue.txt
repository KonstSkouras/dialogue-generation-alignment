B|3| M: It's _all_ _good_ . 
A|4| A: Yeah . 
B|5| M: _for_ . 's're , : ! 
A|6| A: We are real glad we got together because since [that] , [that] time there were only _like_ two [of the] , one sister and one sister-in-law [of the] original family left . And [the] sister-in-law died and [the] sister _is_ [in] _a_ nursing _home_ _, so_ , we are glad [that] we took [that] opportunity two years ago . 
B|7| M:  
A|8| A: _But_ _I_ 
B|9| M:  
A|10| A: Uh-huh . 
B|11| M: No . 
A|12| A: Oh , oh .

B|17| M: Uhh , pickles . 
A|18| A: _but_ . Anyway , well _, it's_ [, uh ,] nice talking _to_ _you_ . Think we've [, uh ,] covered [all] [the] subject . 
B|19| M: [I] 
A|20| A: See them . Yeah . Yeah . It _really_ _is_ . _Well ,_ we're probably fixing _to_ run out [of] time pretty , soon , 
B|21| M:  
A|22| A: Yeah , my husband _is_ _really_ [good] at fixing things , too _, so_ he usually , _be able to_ fix _anything_ _that's_ minor , and and [that] has saved us thousands [of] dollars , _you_ _know_ , from _to_ mechanic _to_ _anything_ _like_ [that] 
B|23| M: _The_ . 
A|24| A: Yeah . 
B|25| M: Did [you] _have_ [to] [leave] ? 
A|26| A: Most , 
B|27| M: You ,.

B|29| M: [I] _have a_ house [, so] _I can_ live [in] [it] . 
A|30| A: Uh , and [, uh ,] 
B|31| M: It's [a] photo _of a_ car [, so] [it's] [not] fake . 
A|32| A: Yeah , _that's_ because [it] , [it] _can't_ tolerate [a] freeze this early . [Is that] [right] ? 
B|33| M: [you] ? 
A|34| A: That's [right] . 
B|35| M: [I] [can't] say I've ever heard _of a_ [home] builder . 
A|36| A: So , [a] lot [of] things [that] are saying [that] they're _no_ longer _going to_ _be_ doing [for] next wars [that] are coming up [that] _they_ did [for] this one [in] getting rid [of a] lot [of] things . So [I] _don't know_ . 
B|37| M: You [don't know] how [it] works ? 
A|38| A: [I] _think_ [so] , [I] _think_ because people sort [of] get through , [you] [know] , um , [I] _think_ [that] people sort [of] learn [the] importance [of] sort [of] physical fitness as well as [the] , as well as , [you] [know] , some mental fitness and [I] _think_ [that] people sort [of] learn [good] sportsmanship and [so] forth .

B|43| M: _I'm_ sorry . _I'm not_ [really] sure how [you can] justify [that] . 
A|44| A: So , [I] , [I can] see [the] advantage [to] [that] one . [The] Peace Corps itself _is_ [really] [a] [, uh ,] dying out , isn't [it] ?
