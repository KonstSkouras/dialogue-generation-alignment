B|37| M: [I] [know ,] _right_ ? 
A|38| A: China _was [a_ little] [bit] more _, uh ,_ _of_ [a] challenge . But , _it ,_ _it_ wasn't more _of_ [a] challenge _in_ [a] sense because [I] hired [a] guide all _the time_ , 
B|39| M: _Yeah [,_ I] read . 
A|40| A: _Uh ,_ probably . _Uh ,_ actually spring semester [a] year _from_ now he's going _to [have_ _to] be_ _in_ child care _uh ,_ five days _a week_ more than likely . _Uh ,_ depending _on_ _how_ [my] class schedule runs 
B|41| M: [Oh ,] [I've] heard [of it] . 
A|42| A: So _, uh ,_ 
B|43| M: [Uh _,] we_ _have _a_ _lot_ of_ flowers _, we_ [just] [don't] [have] [the time] [to] plant [them] 
A|44| A: But , we've _, uh ,_ we've done _, uh ,_ many types [of] camping . We've , we've done tent camping _, and_ [we] had access [to] [a] motor home which [is] [really] super great , _if_ [you] [don't] want [to] rough [it] too _much_ . 
B|45| M: _And , uh _,_ _I'm_ not_ afraid [of] _your_ [kind] . 
A|46| A: _with_ , someone [is] calling [for] someone else _to be_ killed , [you _know] ._ _Is_ [really] [kind] [of] bad 
B|47| M: _I'm_ [good] [for] [a week] [and] [a] half . 
A|48| A: Right . 
B|49| M: [Well , I] am [an] engineer . 
A|50| A: Uh-huh . 
B|51| M:  
A|52| A: Uh-huh , now there [have] been worse summers . In _fact_ _this_ morning when _they_ [were] _talking about [,_ uh ,] Harold Taft , _they_ [were] _talking about_ _how_ _this_ has been _one_ [of] [the] milder [of] [the] summers [and] milder fall , 
B|53| M: _I like_ . 
A|54| A: [Yeah _,] but_ [I] still [think] [a] beater [would] [do] [it] [good] enough , um _, the_ trick [is] [to] _get_ [the] cornstarch , 
B|55| M: _We're_ _in , uh [,_ the] process . 
A|56| A: That , [that] _must _be_ a_ fairly recent release . 
B|57| M: _I'm_ guessing [they] [are] [from] [a] lab _, but the_ [fact] [that] _they _have_ that_ [much] hair _, I'm_ guessing [it's] [a] lab . 
A|58| A: [and] there [really] [are] criminals [that] [are] hard-core [and] , repeat _, and_ never [have] _any_ chance [for] , 
B|59| M: s . 
A|60| A: [Uh [,] I] personally [know] nothing _about the_ Peace Corps though . 
B|61| M: [you] . 
A|62| A: [Well [,] I'm] [just] [saying] [I] shouldn't [, I] shouldn't blast [him like _that] ,_ say , oh well , Laufenberg got _out_ there [and] blew [it] [for] [them] [, I] mean _, he didn't_ _get [to_ see] [much] action . But , too bad . Because now , now , [you [know] _,] he_ had [a] shot [and] _, and_ _didn't_ look too [good] [and] [so] , no one's going _to have_ [much] faith [in] [him] _any_ more . 
B|63| M: _I think_ [it's] _a lot_ [like] [how] I'd [be a] guy [if _I] [was_ a] guy . 
A|64| A: [And] [it's] probably because _I [,_ _I] [,_ [I] was] born _in the_ Chicago area [and] grew up [in] California _, and_ at [that] point [that] [was] sort [of] [the] limit [but] since _then_ [I've] been abroad [a lot] , 
B|65| M: [It's] [not] [about [the] economy] . [It's] [about _the] economic_ situation . 
A|66| A: _and then_ at [the] end [I] had _to be_ too serious . 
B|67| M: _You_ . 
A|68| A: [and] [so] [, I] went [to] Hawaii _and then_ [to] Australia [and] Japan [and] China , 
B|69| M: [Yeah ,] keep [it] 
A|70| A: [you're] definitely [right] , 
B|71| M:  ... [and] ? 
A|72| A: Because [even] [if] [you] [said] , okay , [you [know] ,] armed forces could _have them_ , _some_ idiot [would] come _out_ [and] sell [it] [to] somebody _on_ [the] street [to make] [a] quick buck . 
B|73| M: Uhm . 
A|74| A: _Yes ._ 
B|75| M: _No [,_ he didn't] . He [was] arrested . 
A|76| A: [and] [we] [can't] [see] her often enough [to] [really] [know] what's going _on_ . 
B|77| M: He's [in] [his] garage 
A|78| A: [and] [I] looked at [my] husband [and] [I said] , [you _know] what_ Kyle _this is_ [The] Mansion at Turtle Creek [a] tip [I] bet these [are] [really] [good] seats [and] [so] [we] ended up _on_ first base [right] down there _on_ [the] floor , 
B|79| M: [Did you] [go] [to] [Austin] ? 
A|80| A: Course _, and_ [I like] sugar , too , [that's] [that's] [a] problem , 
B|81| M: _I think_ 
A|82| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right . 
B|83| M: [It's] [like a] car . 
A|84| A: [Oh ,] yeah . Okay . 
B|85| M: They're [not] . 
A|86| A: [Yeah [,] the] cheese fondue [I] [make] , _some_ people [like] swiss , um [, I] prefer cheddar . [And] [I'll] mix [, I] won't [make] [, I] won't [have a] sharp cheddar because _it ,_ [for] fondue _I think it_ should _be a little_ calmer than real sharp , cheddar . 
B|87| M: [I don't know] [if] [it] gives [you] [any] confidence . 
A|88| A: Okay , well , there's [, uh ,] [it's] [kind] [of] [an] interesting topic [and] _one that_ [I think] [is] quite fascinating because [, uh ,] couple [of] years ago [, [I] guess] [, uh ,] [not] very , [not] very long ago , seemed [like] [the] [whole] world , [not] [just] [the] United States [, but the] [whole] world [was] [kind] [of] [in] [a] standstill where everyone [was] basically [in , uh ,] [you [know] ,] [a] very comfortable position [, so] [to] say , [even] though [the] [, the] cold war [was] , [was] [in] full swing . [You] [know ,] [you] had [the] [, the] Russians against [the] Americans [, the] Communists against [the] Free World _, and_ _in the_ last couple [of] years things [have] changed dramatically , [not] _only_ _on_ [the] political front [but] also _on_ [the economic] front , where [, uh ,] couple [of] years ago [we] had [, uh ,] America [was] _one_ [of] [the] leading powers [and] _one_ [of] [the] strongest nations _in the_ world as far as economics [were] concerned _, and_ now we're having [a] very tough [time] [in] [a] recessionary period . [We're] also [have a] very humongous trade deficit _, and_ [, uh _,] and_ [that's] [kind] [of] frightening . Also , [you [know] ,] [a] couple [of] years ago , ten , fifteen , ten , fifteen years ago , [an] individual going into [a] career could expect _to [have_ that] career basically throughout their [whole] life _, and_ thirty years ago , [that] [was] , [that] [was] basically _it ,_ whereas now we're expected _to [have_ a] career change every , [you [know] ,] every couple [of] years [and] possibly four [to] five career changes throughout our lifetime _, and_ [so] [I think] [, uh ,] [you [know] ,] things , there's been [an] awful [lot of] social change lately _, and_ [and] [, uh] . 
B|89| M: [You] . 
A|90| A: Uh-huh . Sure . Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [Oh _.] [Well ,_ I] [have a] room . 
A|92| A: Bye-bye . 
B|93| M: He's adorable , [what] happened [to] [him] ? 
A|94| A: [You] [know ,] [even] [if] they're [in] [good] health [it's] incredible . 
B|95| M: [The] [only] [one that] [I've] ever met [who] [can't] [be a] dog owner [is] [my] dog . 
A|96| A: [Yeah] . [And] [the time] [that] [my] [, we] spent _with_ our Dad [was] [, he] owned [his] [own] business [so] [we] worked _with_ [him] most [of] [the time] . So [that's] [how] [we] spent most [of] [the time] _with_ [him] . 
B|97| M: [I [,] uh ,] [what] ? 
A|98| A: [so] [it's] [kind] [of] [, uh ,] become [an] issue [you] could say . 
B|99| M: [You] [can't] . 
A|100| A: Right . Maybe next year they'll [do] better . 
B|101| M:  ! 
A|102| A: [Oh] 
B|103| M: How does [it ,] [how] ? 
A|104| A: Yep . 
B|105| M: [is] _your_ [news] [on] ? 
A|106| A: [No [,] I] live [in] Maryland . 
B|107| M: [I] [can't] help [but] feel [like] [this is] [an] ad [for] [a] breed . 
A|108| A: [Well] [and] [it's] [the] first step [in ,] [in] actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing [and] _, and_ aging . 
B|109| M: They're [not] expensive . 
A|110| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] well [, I] tell [you] once _you get_ used [to] having [them] [you] , _you get_ spoiled [really] quickly . 
B|111| M: [I think] [it's] [a] [good] _thing ._ 
A|112| A: [so] . 
B|113| M: [Yes .] [Yes] [it] [is] . 
A|114| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . 
B|115| M: [I was] [just] thinking [about] [that [,] [I] think it] _would [be_ a] [good] idea [to [have] them] [in the] school [, [and] then] [some] . 
A|116| A: Uh-huh [. Well ,] we're , Who , [who] 
B|117| M: [You] [must be] [so] sad . 
A|118| A: [but] , 
B|119| M: [Is] [that] [what] [I said] ? 
A|120| A: [And , uh ,] [that] [really] should [be] [in] [your] [but] [if] [you] [don't] spend [it ,] [it] should [be] [in] [your] bank account at [the] end [of] [the] month 
B|121| M: [I can] identify [with] [this] [one] . 
A|122| A: Right . Course , they'd [be] , [they] [would be] barred [, but] 
B|123| M: [I] [know .] 
A|124| A: Uh-huh . Right [and] , 
B|125| M: [Oh ,] [my] . 
A|126| A: [And] we've got grandchildren now [, so] when [they] come , [they [have] [to] [have] a] place . 
B|127| M: [You] [don't [know] what] [I'm] [talking about ,] [you're] [talking [about] the] dog . 
A|128| A: [No ,] [not] [really] . [I'm not] [that] up [be] [on] [that] sort [of] [thing .] 
B|129| M: [And] [then] [you [get] [to] [be] a little] girl [and] [get to] hang [out] [with] [them] .
