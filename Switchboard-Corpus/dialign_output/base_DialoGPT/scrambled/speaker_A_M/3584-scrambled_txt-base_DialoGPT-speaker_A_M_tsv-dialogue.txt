A|74| A: Right [, you know [,] they] , they'd [figure] [a] way [around] [that] one [in] [a] heartbeat . [But] [, I'm] wondering if there's another issue here [, and] maybe [this] is why [this] [has] died [out] . Can [you] go into [, and] [this] wasn't [the] question [but it's] , [it] may _be_ [the] [more of] [the] issue versus should young adults , _can_ [they] go [in] [there] [and] _can_ anyone go into , [well ,] [out] [of] [the] Kurdish community is [a] little bit extreme at [this] time [, but] [say] [, [I] think] Bangladesh would [have] _been_ [a] good example or some , some really desperate situation [and] _teach_ them [to] farm [and] _teach_ them [and it] doesn't [do] [any] good .

B|91| M: [I'm] [so] . [so] . uhh . 
A|92| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] [I mean , [I] don't] [, I] honestly [don't] really [think] [I] could [have] [, you know ,] done much better [than] [I] did [in the] school [system] [I] [was] [in] . [mean] 
B|93| M: [Yeah .] [Uh] .
