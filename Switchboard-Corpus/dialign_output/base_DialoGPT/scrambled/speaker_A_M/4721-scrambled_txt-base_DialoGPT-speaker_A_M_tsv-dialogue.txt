B|5| M: _I'm not sure_ _what_ you're trying [to] [say] . 
A|6| A: Uh-huh . 
B|7| M: yes . yes . _no ._ _no_ 
A|8| A: _Well ,_ oh , hobbies , gee whiz _, _I_ guess_ _I_ got too _many_ hobbies _so_ _I_ never have time [to] deal with them . 
B|9| M: What [about] _your_ kids ? 
A|10| A: Right _, we_ have _enough_ , _enough_ problems with overcrowding _in the_ jails as _it is ._ So let , let their country _take_ care _of_ _it ._

A|16| A: Uh-huh . 
B|17| M: _They_ _, uh , we_ ski . 
A|18| A: And that was [a] great time , _because_ _it's_ _so_ , that's such [a] neat _place_ [and] _it's_ _, there's_ [not] [a] language barrier _so_ [you] _don't_ [, I] mean , there _there's a_ little _bit_ , _because_ _there's_ some _of_ those English words that [you] just _don't_ exactly _know_ [what] they mean [, and] _a lot of_ people have trouble wrestling with their accents _, but_ _it's_ , _it_ was _really_ fun .

B|21| M: [I don't] _think_ [there's a] reason [for] [you] [to] vote . 
A|22| A: Yeah [, I] mean _it_ , _it_ was _really_ exciting , growing up _when_ , _when_ [the] Cowboys were _really_ big .

So [, I] _can't_ , [you] _know ,_ [I'm not] going [to] decide [I don't] [like] them just _because_ they're having [a] few bad years . [I] mean _, I think_ they'll pull _out_ [of] _it_ [, and] , [you] _know ,_ they'll , they'll wind up being _good_ again . They've got some , [lot of] _really_ _good_ young players that [are] going [to] , that [are] going [to] [, uh ,] [do] _pretty good_ _, I think_ . But , they're raising prices on their tickets . So they're banking on doing _good_ next [season] . [I think] tickets [are] , 
B|23| M: What's _your_ age ? 
A|24| A: Yeah . 
B|25| M: You'll get [the] same result _when you_ cook [it .] 
A|26| A: _Yes_ . [I think] [we] ought [to] worry [about] our own species .
