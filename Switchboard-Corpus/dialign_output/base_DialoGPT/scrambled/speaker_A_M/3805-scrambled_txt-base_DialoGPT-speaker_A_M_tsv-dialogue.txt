A|0| A: Say , _that_ good , _I_ _think_ that's , _like_ _the_ state _of_ Virginia , yeah , that's _great_ . 
B|1| M: [I] am confused . 
A|2| A: Uh-huh _. _That's_ what_ it is here , yeah , that's why we're at _a_ point now we've _, uh ,_ we're adopting _and_ we _have been_ married ten plus years _and_ _what_ happens is _, uh ,_ _you_ just realize _that_ once _you_ get to _a_ certain age _the_ next house _that_ _you_ get we'll _be_ staying _in_ Yeah , 
B|3| M: [That's what] [I] was thinking . 
A|4| A: So , [I] guess _in_ this area , at least , _you_ _know ,_ _if_ _it's_ _not_ automatic , it doesn't move . 
B|5| M: It's [not] [like] there's anything else [that] could [be] done . 
A|6| A: Yeah , that's . But , 
B|7| M: _They_ _are_ happening 
A|8| A: [I] bet it had _a_ pretty coat too . 
B|9| M: [That's] [a] nice car [you] [have] there . 
A|10| A: _Well_ no , actually he had no trouble at all . He first jumped _in_ _and_ [I] , he's , he's just about [a] year old himself _and_ never had really , _I don't think_ he'd swum before . 
B|11| M: Mormons . Not [a] lot _of them_ . 
A|12| A: Um , [I] [have] no idea . 
B|13| M: _Well [,_ uh ,] you're [a] bunch [of] [uh [,] uh] ... 
A|14| A: _I know ,_ [I] do too , [I] , most [of] my friends [have] three or four kids _and_ _they_ feel [like] , [you] _know ,_ that's really why God _and_ some [of] _the_ people _in_ our church use birth control _and_ some [of them] _don't_ , [I] had my tubes tied so [you] , 
B|15| M: Oh [. That's] weird . 
A|16| A: _it's_ [not] many from _the_ local communities . 
B|17| M: [I know _,] right_ ? 
A|18| A: [Well ,] good luck to [you] , too . 
B|19| M: You _are_ _right_ , but [they] [have been] _in the_ past . 
A|20| A: [I] _think_ that's coming _and_ [I] _think_ once , once people really start to communicate how [they] feel , things [are] going to change . Until then , [I] _think_ , [you] [know _,] it's_ going to [be] really painful . So [the] question is , how soon [are] we going to start to get our money's worth _and_ , as [you] said _, it's_ how soon we get involved , _and_ [I] _think_ we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved , [like] allowing us to call [a] toll free number _and_ say , hey , look , do it this way , [not] [that] way , or [I] [like] this , or _I don't_ [like] [that] , or this is how [I] feel about your spending my _money_ on art [that] _I don't think_ is art . 
B|21| M: [I don't think] 
A|22| A: Then you'll never leave . 
B|23| M: You're [a] [great] , [great] , wonderful person . 
A|24| A: Uh-huh . 
B|25| M: I'll take [the] car [if] [you] [have] [the] [money] 
A|26| A: So [what] type , Simply Red , I've never heard [of] [that] . Is it just instrumental ? 
B|27| M:  ... [and] ... 
A|28| A: Really . 
B|29| M: You 
A|30| A: Yeah , so _it's_ [been] good _for_ our family . 
B|31| M: It's 
A|32| A: Yeah . [They] probably [have] it better [in] jail than [what] [they] would out [in the] streets . 
B|33| M: It 
A|34| A: [That's] , that's [been] my impression . 
B|35| M: What [are] [you] doing [for] [a] week ? 
A|36| A: Right [, right] . 
B|37| M: Oh , okay . 
A|38| A: Uh-huh .
