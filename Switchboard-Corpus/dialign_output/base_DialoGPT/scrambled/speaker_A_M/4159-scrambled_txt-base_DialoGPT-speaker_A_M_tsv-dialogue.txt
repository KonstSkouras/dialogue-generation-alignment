A|36| A: Now , um , 
B|37| M: Do [they have] any idea [what] [they are] doing ? 
A|38| A: Well , it [just] seems [like] in [the] past three or four years it has [just] gotten so much worse than it [was] . There's always been [a] certain amount [of] crime in your , [you] [know ,] your urban areas , and [I] [know] [we] lived in Chicago for seven years , and [of] course it [was] definitely [there] . _So_ when [we] first moved [here] , it wasn't as bad as this . It's , [you] [know ,] [it's just] getting all [of] [a] sudden so much worse [. I] [don't know] whether [it's] due [to] [the] drugs and [the] [, uh] , drug kings [that] [are] [here] and Jamaican drug kings coming in [. I] [don't know] whether [that's] it , or street gangs [.
