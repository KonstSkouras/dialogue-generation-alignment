B|25| M: You're 
A|26| A: Uh-huh . _Well_ isn't , 
B|27| M: You're [thinking] _of the_ most popular , [not] [the] most common . 
A|28| A: _And_ _I think it's_ _really_ very sad [that] north [of the] border _, you_ [know ,] [the] United States [and] Canada [is] so different , from [the] from South America [, and] Central America . 
B|29| M: _Oh_ [, I'm] sorry [. I] thought [you] _were_ [the] _one_ [that] asked me [to _go] on_ [the] mission .

A|32| A: Yes . 
B|33| M: _yeah_ [, I'm] .

B|35| M: [And] _if_ [you're] [not] [the] owner [of the] flag _then_ [you're] wrong . 
A|36| A: _It_ [is] , because _they_ , 
B|37| M: The _only_ people [that] [have] _ever_ [gotten] health care [in] _this_ country _are_ [the] ones who [have] _been_ [living] [in] _this_ city [for] generations . 
A|38| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|39| M: It's [a] [state] , [not] [a] country . 
A|40| A: Usually _it's_ , [one] other couple come over _for a_ dinner . 
B|41| M: [I think _it's] _a_ good_ idea 
A|42| A: [And] _, I_ also believe we [don't] , even though [I] feel like [I] _pay_ [a good] share towards [the] school system , [that the] teachers [are] still underpaid [and] we still [don't] [have] enough money towards put [in] toward public school . 
B|43| M: You're [, uh ,] [good] _at_ [it .] 
A|44| A: but _Yeah_ . but [it] _that's_ [uh] _that's_ what [I] _mean_ , _see_ , but but realistically when _you think_ [of] [it] [it] just sounds like such an awful thing [, and] [it] evokes an emotional response [.

B|53| M: You [know [,] I'm not] [a] big fan [of] the'' . 
A|54| A: Uh , we've got five bedrooms , because we built onto our garage .

B|61| M: [That's] [not] [how] [it] works 
A|62| A: [Right .] 
B|63| M: Uhh [, you] [don't] [pay] taxes [on] [the] income [of] [your] income , [right ?] 
A|64| A: [Oh] . 
B|65| M: It's [a] common misconception . 
A|66| A: There was cartoon [in] COSMO [about] [a] year or two ago [and] [it] had [this] man sitting [on] [a] couch with his date [and] there [were] cats hanging all over him . Hanging [on] his clothes [, you] [know ,] _they_ had ripped him up [and] [the] couch was ripped up [and] down [at] [the] bottom he said , [of] course [I] love cats .

A|74| A: _Well [,_ that's] [good] . _Well ,_ we [, um ,] let's [see] , [the only] other _place_ [I've] [ever] vacationed , we'd [, you] [know ,] [go on] camping trips up [to] Texoma [and] things like [that] . 
B|75| M: So [do] [you think] [they] [are] [going [to] be] [on] [the] Peace corps ? 
A|76| A: because kind [of] hard _to find_ [one] prebuilt [that] 's kind [of] fits those specifications .
