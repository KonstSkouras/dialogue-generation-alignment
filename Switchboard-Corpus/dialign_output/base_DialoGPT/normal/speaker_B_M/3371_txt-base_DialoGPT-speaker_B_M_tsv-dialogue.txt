B|17| M: They [are] [the] only ones [that] [have] _been_ [built] . 
A|18| B: But [I] _mean_ _it_ doesn't give _you_ trouble ? 
B|19| M: Not _in the_ sense [that] you're gonna [have] [to get] _a whole_ bunch [of] stuff . 
A|20| B: Uh-huh . 
B|21| M: _You_ [mean] [the construction] [on Fox] amp [Jacobs] ?

A|24| B: All right . 
B|25| M: Not _at_ all . 
A|26| B: And _is_ _it_ , um , [a] natural gas [and] , 
B|27| M: The question [is] , _how_ ? 
A|28| B: [You] _know_ [what I] miss though ? Basements . 
B|29| M: He shrugs [. I've] _been_ lucky . 
A|30| B: [I] [I] sure wish _they_ _could_ build basements [in] homes [in] Texas .

A|32| B: So _you_ , 
B|33| M: [I] [have] , I'm just saying _that's_ [what] [I've] seen _a lot_ . 
A|34| B: Can _you_ _stand_ up _in _it_ ?_ 
B|35| M: _My_ mom _has_ [a] [house] [in] my [house] . [I] _don't_ [know] _if_ _I could_ [stand] [in _it] ._ 
A|36| B: So _you _have_ a_ _probably a_ more pitched _roof_ _than_ [is] typical around here . 
B|37| M: [I] _don't_ [know ,] _it's_ [probably _a] lot_ louder [than] [it] sounds . 
A|38| B: ours [is] pitched so shallow [that] _you_ [, uh ,] [don't] [get] much room [in the] _attic_ . 
B|39| M: _My_ [attic] _is _a_ lot_ smaller [than] my [house] .

A|44| B: Uh-huh . 
B|45| M: Uhhhhh . What's [the] difference between [the] [two] ? 
A|46| B: Isn't [it] funny [how] families end up living [in] one room [in the] [house] most [of] [the] time . 
B|47| M: The only thing [I] can think [of] [is] [the] 
A|48| B: [You] 
B|49| M: [You] [are] correct . 
A|50| B: Right . _Some people [,_ I] [mean] , families seem [to] migrate towards one , one room [and] carry [on] most [of] their activities there [, and] [, uh [,] uh ,] some rooms _, we_ [have] one room [that] [we] never use . 
B|51| M: [Some people [,] [we] call] [it] [a] [family] . 
A|52| B: [I] [mean] might as well [not] _even_ heat [and] _cool_ [it .] 
B|53| M: We arent [even] going [to get] [to] [that] . 
A|54| B: Strange . 
B|55| M: Well [, we] [do] [have a] [house] .

B|61| M: [I] [don't] [know] . 
A|62| B: Wow . Boy , [it] doesn't seem [that] _long_ [but] [it] [is] because [we] [, uh ,] came [to] _this area_ _about [the_ same] time 
B|63| M: [How long have] [we] [been in] [this area] ? 
A|64| B: We've [been] fifteen , fifteen _years_ [in the] , [in the] [house] [that] we're living [in] . 
B|65| M: You've [been [in] the] neighborhood for eighteen [years] ? 
A|66| B: And [we] , [the] , [the] principal feature [I] like [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
B|67| M: What [about the] tower ? 
A|68| B: Yours [is _a] slab_ [I] assume . 
B|69| M: Well , [it's] _a slab ._ 
A|70| B: Yeah , ours [is a] pier [and] beam which [has] allowed me [to] go under [it] [and] [do] [a whole] [lot of] different things [that] [I could] [not] [have] done [if] [it] was [slab .] 
B|71| M: Is [it] [slab] ? 
A|72| B: [I've] done [a lot of] electrical [and] plumbing [and] other work [that] , by myself [and] saved [a lot of] money [that] [I] couldn't [have] done [if] [the] [house] was [on] [a slab .] 
B|73| M: Do [you have] any experience [with] [slab] building ? 
A|74| B: But [that's] because [it's] so old . 
B|75| M: _My_ [house] [is] [slab .] 
A|76| B: [It's] thirty-five , thirty-six [years] old [when] [they] used [to] build like [that] [, and] [, uh ,] 
B|77| M: That's [pretty] [cool] . 
A|78| B: [I] [know ,] he's [not] [a] handy , right ? 
B|79| M: That's [not] [how] [that] works 
A|80| B: [I ,] [on] [the] other hand [, uh ,] [do] [a lot] [too] much [of] [it] 
B|81| M: [I] [have [a] lot of] problems [with it .] 
A|82| B: [and] [, uh ,] [I've] gotten _good at_ [it] which [in] [a] , [in] [a] way [is] bad because then [you] [, uh ,] [you] start [to] take pleasure [in it] 
B|83| M: Well , [that's] why [you] [get] [good at] making [a] joke , isn't [it ?]
