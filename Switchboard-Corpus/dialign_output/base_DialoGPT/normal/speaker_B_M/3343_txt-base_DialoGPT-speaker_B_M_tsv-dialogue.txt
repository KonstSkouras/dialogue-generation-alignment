B|13| M: [so] , _you're_ saying _, you could_ [have the] entire _thing_ done [in] 5 _years_ ? 
A|14| B: [Well ,] _that's_ true _, and_ lot _of_ times though , _it_ _is_ , _it_ costs [so] much _to_ get _something_ fixed _that_ [you] almost _are_ just as well off buying another one [you] _know ,_ if it's ,

B|19| M: Why 
A|20| B: _I _,_ you _,_ I_ think there's _, there_ [can] _be_ [a] _lemon in_ anything [but] _, uh _,_ I_ think more often than _not_ ,

A|22| B: _you [,_ you] _pretty_ well _know_ what [you're] getting ahead _of time_ [, and] _, uh_ [you] _know ,_ if [you] [buy a] good one [, you] shouldn't [have] any [, you] _know ,_ too much _of_ [a] problem with [it] ,

B|25| M: Ohh [, I] thought [you] were talking about [the lemon] . 
A|26| B: [We] never [could] get [it] declared [a] [lemon] [, and] [the] [car] would go [and] , without any warning whatsoever [, you could] _be_ _going_ down [the] freeway [at] sixty [and] [it] would stop 
B|27| M: You [can't] 
A|28| B: [and] _I _,_ there_ _was_ just [, you] _know [,_ and] , oh , [we] went round [and] round with [the] manufacturer [and] [, and] everything [, and] [they] got [it] finally semifixed [, but] [it] _was_ such [a] hassle 
B|29| M: Oh [, you [,] there] were no

B|31| M: [I] am 
A|32| B: Uh-huh . 
B|33| M: That . 
A|34| B: [Well [,] I] think _that's_ true [, and] _I [,_ uh ,] now [we] generally don't [buy a] warranty , because [you] think [, you] _know ,_ [at] least for [the] first couple _of_ [years] , nothing should go wrong with [it .]
