A|0| B: Okay . Go ahead . 
B|1| M: _I know_ . 
A|2| B: _Yeah_ 
B|3| M: _I mean ,_ I've seen _people_ say _that ._ 
A|4| B: _That's true ._ 
B|5| M: They _are the_ best . 
A|6| B: Um , me either _. _I_ _,_ I_ went _to_ college _and_ then started working _and_ then got married _and_ , 
B|7| M: What _about_ _you_ ? 
A|8| B: _No_ _, I_ haven't _, [I_ know] _that _,_ uh ,_ _my_ sister _, I_ _have a_ twin sister _and_ _when they_ graduated _she_ went _to_ _, uh ,_ teach _in_ _a_ small town down _in_ south Texas _and_ _I know ,_ [that] _like_ _if_ [you] _have_ college notes , _if_ [you] teach _in_ _a_ lower income bracket _where_ _they_ _don't_ pay as much _and_ _they_ cancel part _of_ your _, you_ _know ,_ your college note or whatever . 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: Uh-huh . If _it's_ _like_ _, you_ _know ,_ _really a_ _, you_ _know ,_ _a_ lower paying job _, you_ _know ,_ _where_ _in_ _a_ small town [you] _don't_ obviously [you] _don't_ need as much as far as _to_ _, you_ _know ,_ _to_ live . 
B|11| M:  
A|12| B: _Yeah ,_ _she_ _only_ taught there _one_ year _but_ _I ,_ 
B|13| M: How , _I'm_ 
A|14| B: Uh-huh . 
B|15| M: [Yeah _,] but_ [she] _didn't_ _get the_ credit 
A|16| B: And , um _, _I_ think_ _it_ would be _, [I_ know] [that] also _one_ _of_ _my_ cousins _who_ _, uh ,_ he _is in_ _like_ [the] therapy type thing _and_ he _was_ , um , _some_ group paid part _of_ his college income [but] then he _was_ required _to go_ back _and_ work for _a_ certain number _of_ years _in_ this town at _, uh _,_ uh , [I_ mean _,] it's_ _a_ nursing home or something _like_ [that .] 
B|17| M: [I think] [it's] [the] [one] [where] [she] teaches 
A|18| B: So _, you_ _know ,_ _if_ _, [I_ think] that's _a good_ _way_ for [people] _to_ _, you_ _know ,_ maybe [get] [people] _to_ come back _to_ these small towns _to_ work by helping [people] [that] normally might _not_ be able _to go to_ college _and_ [get the] type _of_ degree _they_ want . 
B|19| M: You [know] 
A|20| B: [Yeah] . As far as yeah , getting doctors _and_ _all_ [that] stuff , yeah . 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: [Yeah] . 
B|23| M: Oh , 
A|24| B: Uh-huh . 
B|25| M: Oh [. [I] think] _I'm_ gonna [go] _with_ no . 
A|26| B: [Yeah] . 
B|27| M: You _can_ _see_ [the] city . [and] [the] city [is _in] the_ middle _of the_ ocean . You [know] _what_ [I mean] . It's [not] [like] we _are going to_ [get] any new cities . _But_ we _have [to_ go to] [the] city . 
A|28| B: [I] _really_ _don't_ [know] [that] much [about] _it_ _, you_ _know _,_ _I_ _,_ _I_ _,_ [I_ think] [of _the] Peace_ Corps _, you_ _know ,_ more [like] [the] sixties [and] [that] kind [of] stuff _when_ , 
B|29| M: [I [,] uh _, I] don't_ . 
A|30| B: [Yeah] . And [don't] _they_ [go] into other countries [and] stuff ? 
B|31| M: [Yeah ,] _they're_ called [the Peace] corps . 
A|32| B: Uh-huh . Things [that] _make_ [the] , yeah . Make them more self-supporting ? 
B|33| M: How _do_ [they] _do that_ ? 
A|34| B: [Yeah] . 
B|35| M: [Yeah [,] you] ? 
A|36| B: Right . [Yeah] . 
B|37| M: _But_ , we _do_ [have a] program [that] does [that .] 
A|38| B: [But] _it_ definitely would give _a lot [of_ the] _kids_ now _that have_ everything given [to] them _that they_ want [to] [see] [what] [it's] [like] _if_ [you] [don't] [have] _all the_ _money_ [and] can't [have] _what you_ want _when_ [you] want _it ._ 
B|39| M: _I don't_ [think] so 
A|40| B: Uh-huh . 
B|41| M: You're [kids] . 
A|42| B: [Yeah] . 
B|43| M: Would [it] 
A|44| B: [I don't] [, I don't] [know] [that] [you] could require everyone [to] , [do that] for , yeah , _to _do_ it_ for [a] whole year , or two years or something [like] _that ,_ 
B|45| M: Maybe [you] _can_ [make] [a] list [of] [all the] things [that have] been done _in the_ past ? 
A|46| B: [I don't] [know] [that] [that] would work _if_ , somebody's , _was_ , [didn't] _really_ want [to] be there [and] [didn't] [have] , 
B|47| M: Can we _just_ [have a] mandatory season ? 
A|48| B: [Yeah [,] [I] mean ,] there would be loopholes [just] [like] there [is in] anything else 
B|49| M: I'd _rather_ [not] [have] [my] [way] _out_ [of] [it .] 
A|50| B: [Yeah] . 
B|51| M:  
A|52| B: [Yeah] . 
B|53| M: L 
A|54| B: Uh-huh . 
B|55| M: Oh , _there's_ [a lot of] [people] [who] _are_ dying _, we're_ [just] losing [some] . 
A|56| B: Uh-huh . 
B|57| M: People _are_ still extinct point [and] figure 
A|58| B: Right , yeah . 
B|59| M: You're right . 
A|60| B: [Yeah ,] uh-huh . 
B|61| M: It's [a] question _, but_ [it's] _not [really_ a] question . 
A|62| B: [Yeah] . 
B|63| M: [I think] [the] fact [that _they] were_ so sad [when _they] were_ kicked _out_ [of the] _country_ [was] [a good] example . 
A|64| B: [Yeah] . 
B|65| M: They _are_ [all] [like] friends . 
A|66| B: [Yeah] . 
B|67| M: [I mean] ... You [do] [have] [the] peace corps though . 
A|68| B: Well , Down here [with] [the Peace] Corps [we're] talking [about] [all] these [people] [that] aren't even [in] our own [country] [when] [there's] enough [people] here [that] [I think] probably need help [and] , could be helped . 
B|69| M: [I know ,] _I'm not_ . 
A|70| B: [Yeah] . 
B|71| M: [No] . It's _not [really_ a] problem . 
A|72| B: And maybe [rather] than [just] , require somebody [to] join [like] [the Peace] Corps for [a] year maybe [like] , um , during college [, you] [know ,] maybe [have] [some] kind [of] course [where] they'd be required _to do_ [some] kind [of] community service type work _, and_ help [people] [in] [that] area or [people] [in the] United States . 
B|73| M: North America 
A|74| B: There probably [are] [, you] [know ,] for [but] [I'm] sure , that's probably [like] [people] [that] [do that] [are] , [are the] [people] [that] [are going [to] go] into social work [and] stuff [but] [I think] [that] [it] wouldn't [really] be half bad for everybody [not] _to do_ something [, you] [know _,] and_ realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to] , um , help these [people] [, you] [know _,] and_ _I'm not saying_ [just] give them _money_ [but] [, [I] mean ,] because [they] [have to] be taught [to] be , 
B|75| M: [I] 
A|76| B: [Yeah] [I mean [,] [I] know] that's [what] [my] father-in-law [was] talking [about] [, you] [know ,] [when] [you] give these [people] _money_ or , [what] [was] [it] [they were] bringing up points asking as far as whether [they] need [to] give , um , more _money_ [to] these [people] [, [I] mean _,] and_ that's [not really] [the] answer [, [I] mean ,] because _if they're_ alcoholics they'll [just] [go] [out] [and] spend , [it] on [, you] [know ,] booze or something [like] _that ,_ 
B|77| M:  ... 
A|78| B: [but] . 
B|79| M: [money] 
A|80| B: [Yeah] . 
B|81| M: [I'm] [, _it's] [,_ and] 
A|82| B: Or [, you] [know ,] [to] find [a] job [where] [they] [can] learn how [to] support themselves , 
B|83| M: [I know] [what you] [mean] . [But] [if they're] [going to] try [to [do] [that] ,] [they] should [do [it] .] 
A|84| B: [I mean [,] I] guess [we're] getting kind [of] off [the] subject , here [, but] . 
B|85| M: You're right . 
A|86| B: [Yeah [,] [I] mean] [it's ,] _True ._ [Yeah] . 
B|87| M: [True .] [I'm not saying] [that] [the] military [is] [the] [only] branch [of the] US government . 
A|88| B: [Yeah] . 
B|89| M: [That's true .] 
A|90| B: Flower Mound , yeah . So [, we're] [a] little [you] [know ,] farther removed from [like] Dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas [where] [they] probably [have] more [of the] homeless [and] [that] type [of] thing .
