A|0| B: _So _,_ I_ own _a_ home _in_ Pensacola _, and_ _, uh ,_ let's _see_ _, we are_ _to_ compare homes . Correct ? 
B|1| M: _Well [,_ we are] _from _the_ same_ state . 
A|2| B: _Uh ,_ my home _is_ , well , _is_ typical for [the] area . _I_ live _in a_ development _, uh _,_ _it's_ a_ relatively _, _I_ would_ _say_ , well , God , _it_ sounds _like ,_ sounds _like_ _I'm_ bragging 
B|3| M: Okay . [So] you're _not ,_ huh ? 
A|4| B: _But_ _it's_ upper middle class _, uh ,_ kind _of_ _an_ environment . 
B|5| M: _It's a_ place . 
A|6| B: [It's a] two story colonial , which my wife _and_ _I_ designed . 
B|7| M: Is _that_ [an] _old_ model ? 
A|8| B: _Uh ,_ _it_ has around thirty-two hundred square feet . _Uh ,_ five bedrooms _and_ _so_ forth _and_ _so_ _on_ , 
B|9| M:  ... What's _that_ ? 
A|10| B: _and_ _it is_ _, _I_ would_ imagine _in_ terms _of_ , _of_ size _and_ _so_ forth _, it's_ relatively typical for [the] area . It might _be_ _, _I_ would_ _say_ _it's_ _probably_ midsized for [the] area . There [are] some smaller _, and_ there [are] _, you know ,_ several larger . 
B|11| M: Is [it] large ? 
A|12| B: And _, uh ,_ but based _, you know _,_ in_ terms _of_ _, you know _,_ in_ _, in_ Pensacola _, in_ [that] area _of_ Florida [it] _, uh _,_ it's_ _what_ now , _it is_ _, uh _,_ probably_ ten years [old] . 
B|13| M: _That's [,_ uh [,] uh] . 
A|14| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|15| M: [I] don 
A|16| B: And _so_ _it's_ _, in_ terms _of_ cost _and_ _, and_ _, and_ size _and_ _so_ forth , [it] [, uh _,] the_ _you know ,_ housing there _is_ extremely affordable _, and_ [, uh ,] compared _to_ other parts _of the_ country _, you know ,_ let's _say_ compared _to_ Maryland [that] [same] _house_ here _would_ _probably_ cost three-quarters _of_ _a million dollars_ 
B|17| M: Nope , _no_ 
A|18| B: but , 
B|19| M: The [house] [is] [in] Baltimore . 
A|20| B: [I] really haven't _, I_ really haven't [, uh ,] when [we] built [it] ten years ago , [it] _was_ , [it] ran around [a] hundred _and_ forty thousand _dollars_ . 
B|21| M: [I] 
A|22| B: _So _,_ I _,_ _I_ would_ _have_ really _, I_ haven't really priced _, you know _,_ _in_ the_ market _, so_ _I ,_ 
B|23| M: _What_ _do_ [you] _mean , I_ [have] [, I ,] I've _been_ _to [,_ you know [,] the] moon . 
A|24| B: Uh-huh . 
B|25| M: How _much money_ ? 
A|26| B: Uh-huh . 
B|27| M:  ... [so] what's [the] deal ? 
A|28| B: [I] thought [that] _was_ _on_ [the] upswing again now . 
B|29| M: _Yeah [,_ _it's] not_ [a] huge deal . 
A|30| B: Uh-huh . 
B|31| M: [But] _they_ [are] [a] part [of the] economy ... 
A|32| B: Yes . 
B|33| M: You _mean ,_ [like [,] _in] Dallas_ ? 
A|34| B: Uh-huh 
B|35| M: _Uh _, I_ think_ [the] economy [is] _good [,_ so] _I'm not_ _sure_ what's going [on] . 
A|36| B: [Well ,] Pensacola has [it's] really _is a_ buyer's market there now 
B|37| M: I'd [say] [the] Pensaclippers [are] _the most expensive_ team [in the] state . 
A|38| B: And [it] isn't because [of the] , well , there has [been] [a] lot [of] speculative building . [Uh _, I] _don't_ [know_ ,] perhaps [not] [in Dallas] , 
B|39| M: [I don't] _think_ _it is ._ [It's a] fact . 
A|40| B: but [, uh _,] I'm_ [sure] people [in] [, uh [,] you know [,] in] [, uh ,] Galveston _and_ [so] forth _would_ _be_ knowledgeable about [it] [, uh ,] Pensacola _is _a_ Navy_ town . 
B|41| M: I've never [been] [to] Galvesto [, I'm] _just_ [not] [sure] _if [I_ would] ever [be] [in [a] Navy] ship . 
A|42| B: And home porting _was_ [a] possibility [a] few years ago . 
B|43| M: [Well [,] I'm] [in] Galvesto . 
A|44| B: They were expecting [an] influx [of] _something_ [on] [the] order [of] fifty thousand people _or_ more [from the] [Navy] , 
B|45| M:  ... [I don't] _get_ _it ._ 
A|46| B: [a] new carrier _was_ coming [in] _and_ [, uh [,] the] [, uh ,] attendant [, uh ,] support vessels . _Well , that's_ [no] longer [, the] case . 
B|47| M:  ... [what] [was] [the] plan ? 
A|48| B: _Oh [,_ it's] , [it is .] [I] [mean [,] the] _, the number_ [of] single family units [on] sale [is] phenomenal compared [to] [the] population . 
B|49| M: You _do_ realize _that's not_ [what] _they_ [mean _,] right_ ? 
A|50| B: And [so] overbuilding [is] , has [been] [a] real problem there . 
B|51| M: _Yeah [,_ the number] [is a] _bit_ _high ._ 
A|52| B: [So] [you] can still [get] [a] , [get] [a] _, a_ [good] [house] for [a] very , very reasonable price . And [I] [mean] [good [,] [I] would] , let's [say] typical , [say] three bedroom [, uh ,] two _and_ [a] half baths , [on] [a] half acre _or_ [so] [of] land [uh ,] reasonable construction [would] _probably_ run [you] [, uh [,] right] now anywhere between , somewhere between [a] hundred _and_ [a] hundred _and_ forty thousand _dollars_ . And _probably_ , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
B|53| M: 500 
A|54| B: [What] about your home ? 
B|55| M: [Well , that's] 
A|56| B: Uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|58| B: Uh-huh . 
B|59| M: What's [the] rent [like] ? 
A|60| B: Nor [do] [we] , but , 
B|61| M: Uhh [, I] don t [know ,] 
A|62| B: Uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [I'm] pretty [sure] [the] [house] [was] made [in the] 70's . 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: Hehuh . 
A|66| B: Right . 
B|67| M: Er [uh] 
A|68| B: [Well [,] the] housing here [in] Maryland [is] [just] atrocious . And [in] [, [in] the] entire D C area _. I'm_ [, I'm] only about [, uh ,] twelve miles _or_ [so] [from the] [, uh ,] border [of] Washington D C _, and_ Montgomery County , Maryland [is] _probably_ one [of [the] most expensive] , places [to ,] 
B|69| M:  ? 
A|70| B: _No [,_ we are] west . 
B|71| M: You [know] ? 
A|72| B: Sevren [is] east , near [the] eastern shore , 
B|73| M: [I don't] [get] _it ._ 
A|74| B: [if I] had , 
B|75| M: [I ,] wouldn't , 
A|76| B: Uh-huh . 
B|77| M: Sev ren ? 
A|78| B: _Oh [,_ [that's] not] unusual , yeah . 
B|79| M: [It's] [like] [a million dollars] [or] [something] . 
A|80| B: [Well _, that's] ,_ [that] area over there [is] [not] as [expensive] as [in the] [, the] immediate [, you know ,] Washington area . 
B|81| M: The , then . 
A|82| B: And [so] [, we] [, uh [,] I] [was] [just] looking , for example there [is a] [, uh ,] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex where [I] live _, and_ [I] [was] over there recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] two bedroom condominium . And ninety-two thousand [dollars] for [a] two bedroom , which [is] essentially [a] two bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: I'mverysmart 
A|84| B: Now , [it] [was] very nicely done . 
B|85| M: That [was] quite nice [of] [you] . 
A|86| B: [I would] [have] thought , 
B|87| M: That [was] [the] plan , yes . 
A|88| B: Yes . [I [,] I] can't [, I] can't envision spending [that] [much money] _, and_ [on] , [on] [something] along those lines . 
B|89| M: Did [you] [not] watch [the] video ? 
A|90| B: _So [,_ you know [,] it's] [, I] guess [you] pay [the] piper but , Plus [the] [, the] [, the] taxes around here [are] phenomenally , [high .] 
B|91| M: [No [,] I don't] . 
A|92| B: [Uh ,] for [the] _, and_ [so] [, you] , [on] [that] [it's not] unusual , for example , for somewhere around here [on] [a] , [on] [a] , [on] [a] _, what_ [we] [would] [, you know _,] what_ [you] described as your [house] _and_ [what] [I would] describe as my [house] [say] , for example [, in] Pensacola , Florida , [on] [that] [house] with [the] homestead exemption _and_ [so] forth _and_ [so] [on] , might pay three [or] four hundred [dollars] [a] year taxes . maybe [, you know ,] maybe [a] little [bit] higher than [that] now , 
B|93| M: [I] 
A|94| B: but [that] [same] [house] here , you'd pay almost six thousand [dollars] [a] year , taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: You [, probably] . 
A|96| B: _So [,_ it's] [, uh [,] so] [, the] question [of] whether [to] buy here [or] move [to] another county , [say] , drive twenty more miles north , buy [a] condominium for approximately [, uh [,] [the] same] price , maybe [a] little lower , but [the] taxes [would] [be] [, you know ,] perhaps , maybe one-third [uh ,] [of] , 
B|97| M: [to [,] that's [,] a] [house] 
A|98| B: _Oh ,_ absolutely . [Yeah ,] 
B|99| M: [Oh [,] I] [see] . [So ,] [if] [you] [don't] mind me asking [, what] 
A|100| B: [so] [, it's] [, it's] really sad 
B|101| M: [Well [,] _I'm] not_ even [a] guy [, and] I've [been] told [it's a] joke . 
A|102| B: This [is] one , this [is] one [of [the] most] highly taxed areas [in the] country . 
B|103| M: [I'm] [in the] UK [. _I'm] not_ [a] citizen . 
A|104| B: [Well ,] [they] [it] [, the] , their , [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good ,] such things as extremely [good] _school_ systems , for example . It has one [of the] best _school_ systems [in the] country . 
B|105| M: Why [do] [you] _think_ [they] [have] [so] many problems ? 
A|106| B: [Uh [,] and] because [the] cost [of] living around here [is] [so] [high] , 
B|107| M: Why [is] [that] ? 
A|108| B: public employees make great salaries around here 
B|109| M: [But] [I'm] [from the] UK . 
A|110| B: [I] [was] reading [just] recently where [the] typical administrator [in the] , Montgomery County _Public_ Schools makes [, and] _I'm not ,_ this [is] [, uh [,] the] figure , he makes eighty thousand [dollars] [a] year . 
B|111| M: You [don't know] [what] [a] [Public] employee [is] ? 
A|112| B: [That's ,] 
B|113| M: [I'm not [,] I'm] [a] private [school] teacher . 
A|114| B: [and] [I ,] by administrator [I [,] I think] [I] [mean [, I] ,] [they] didn't , [they] did [not] define [it] , but for example [, a] curriculum supervisor [or] principal [or] someone [, you know [,] in] [that] [, uh [,] in] [that] range .
