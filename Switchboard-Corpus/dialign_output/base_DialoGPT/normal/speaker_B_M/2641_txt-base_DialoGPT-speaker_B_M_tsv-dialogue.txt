A|0| B: Uh-huh . 
B|1| M: _Oh_ _yeah_ ? Um _, uh _,_ uh_ . 
A|2| B: _Yeah , _I_ like_ having cats around or pets around _in_ general _I , I_ favor _dogs_ over cats actually _but_ , 
B|3| M: [I like] _dogs _,_ they're_ cool . 
A|4| B: _Oh _,_ I'm_ _, I'm_ _a dog_ person _. I_ had _, I guess it_ depends on _what_ _you_ had when _he_ were _a_ kid _, right ?_ 
B|5| M: _I was_ always [a dog] _people_ [. _I] don't_ _, uh _,_ like_ [dogs] . 
A|6| B: Uh-huh . 
B|7| M: You _have _a_ cat_ ? 
A|8| B: _But_ _not_ cats . 
B|9| M: _And_ [dogs] 
A|10| B: Uh-huh . 
B|11| M: [But] _no_ 
A|12| B: _The_ _thing_ [I don't] [like] _about_ [dogs] sometimes _is_ _that_ _the house_ will _just_ reek , _of_ _the_ [dogs _,] and_ constantly . 
B|13| M: It's [dog] 
A|14| B: _Yeah _,_ that's_ _true_ . 
B|15| M: They . 
A|16| B: Uh-huh . 
B|17| M: _I think_ [that's] cute . 
A|18| B: Limited . 
B|19| M: [I'm] sorry _, I don't_ understand . 
A|20| B: _Oh ,_ _really_ ? 
B|21| M: _That's_ _the most_ important _thing ._ 
A|22| B: Uh-huh . 
B|23| M: i'm ? 
A|24| B: _Oh ,_ _that_ sounds _so_ easy , _what _I_ did_ , 
B|25| M: _No ,_ 
A|26| B: _Yeah , I_ housesat from cats _for_ [a] friend _of_ mine which she [was] finishing up her thesis , 
B|27| M: _I think_ [you] _mean_ _cat_ . 
A|28| B: _and_ _what_ _we_ used _to do_ [was] _just_ put _, um ,_ newspaper on [the] bottom _and_ then put [cat] litter _and_ then [I] _would_ _just_ take [the] whole [thing] _to_ [the] garbage _can_ _and_ dump [the] whole [thing .] 
B|29| M: _That's_ _pretty_ cool , I'd love [to do] _that ._ 
A|30| B: Then [I] _would_ [do] _it_ _, you _know_ ,_ everyday or two days _so_ [I] _would_ clean [that] pan _very_ , _very_ rarely , 
B|31| M: [I'm] [not] sure _how_ _many_ _times_ I've done _this_ , _but I_ _have a_ good _amount of time_ _in [the_ house] 
A|32| B: _and_ _so_ _it_ wasn't _so_ bad . 
B|33| M: [The] last _time_ [I did] _that _,_ it was_ _for the_ second _time_ 
A|34| B: two cats _and_ _just_ _as_ easy [it] _just_ _never_ started smelling [, I] _would_ put _just_ [a] little _bit_ [of] [cat] litter [in] _there_ , because if [I] put _a lot_ , one [of] [the] cats _would_ [have] _been_ , 
B|35| M: How _many_ _times_ [have] [you] _tried_ _this_ ? 
A|36| B: all [of] her animals [that] she ever had were adopted . 
B|37| M: How _do [you_ know] ? 
A|38| B: [I] [that] _true_ _, yeah_ . _Yeah ,_ she's even got , she's got one [dog] now _and_ [the] two cats _and_ her [dog] _there_ _is_ , _is_ basically [a] reject , somebody had bought him _, and_ wanted him . 
B|39| M: _oh_ [yeah] ! _I remember that_ ! 
A|40| B: It [was] her ex boyfriend _and_ _, you _know_ ,_ _just_ [was] [not] mature enough _to keep_ [the] [dog] , _didn't_ realize [how] much work [it was] _and_ now , she's stuck with _it ._ 
B|41| M: What _happened_ ? 
A|42| B: [And] she's _just_ _so_ kindhearted [that] she _just_ takes all [the] animals [but [I] think] [that] [for] me , well , _my_ husband _just_ has completely nixed [the] _idea_ [of] having [a dog] or [a cat] because [that's] all _there_ _is_ [to] _it ._ _So _, you_ _know_ ,_ 
B|43| M: [I] 
A|44| B: [No _,] we_ _don't have_ _anything_ _right_ now . 
B|45| M: [So , you] don'have [anything] [to] 
A|46| B: _Oh _,_ right_ , now _we have a_ kid [but] _he_ [was] _, no_ , completely against having [a dog] or [cat] _, he_ said [, they're] much [, they're] _as_ much work _as a_ kid _, and_ [they're] harder [to] _get_ rid [of] [for the] weekend , [And] , 
B|47| M: What [, you know] 
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M: You [can] . 
A|50| B: [That's] [, uh _,] yeah ,_ _really_ _true_ . [But] [like] [the] friends , other friends [of] mine [have] cats _, they_ [have] four [of] _them_ _, and_ if _they_ go away _, they_ [have] _, they_ hire [a] pet sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day _and_ pet _them_ _and_ things [like] [that] _and_ _their_ cats [, you _know] [,_ they're] _so_ used [to] [the] attention , [that] if _they_ [don't] _get_ [it] _, they_ _get_ _really_ upset , 
B|51| M:  [, they] ,? 
A|52| B: _and_ [, you _know] [,_ they] sort [of] cause trouble around [the house] _and_ things [like] [that [.] _I] , I_ [tried] [to] [have] _, um ,_ figured something having , _so_ [I] [tried] [to] [have a] goldfish , 
B|53| M: You . 
A|54| B: _and_ _, um [,_ I] killed [that] one within _a very_ short [amount of _time] ._ 
B|55| M: ' [about] . 
A|56| B: Right . 
B|57| M: i , i , i . 
A|58| B: My brother had _fish_ when [I was] [a] kid [I remember [that] _,] and_ one [of] his _fish_ jumped _out of_ [the] _, um ,_ gosh , _what_ [do you] call [it] , _fish_ tank . [And] fried itself , on [the] radiator behind [the] dresser . I'll _never_ forget [that] because [I remember] _my_ brother _, he_ came home _and_ _he_ counted [the] _fish_ 
B|59| M: i'm 
A|60| B: _and_ one [of] [the] _fish_ [was] missing _and_ [they] couldn't find [it] anyplace [, they] couldn't figure _out_ _what_ had [happened] _and_ then [they] found [it] fried on , [the] radiator behind . 
B|61| M: Fish 
A|62| B: [it was] [not] gross _, I didn't_ see [it] [but] _, um ,_ got _them ._ 
B|63| M: How [did] [he] [get] [out _of] that_ [fish] ? 
A|64| B: Trying [to] [remember] _we_ had [a dog] [for] [a] while _, and [I_ don't] [know] if _we_ got rid [of] [the] [dog] because _my_ brother [was] allergic [to] [it] , _my_ brother had asthma _and_ some allergies which [I think] _he's_ outgrown now , 
B|65| M: Why [would] [you] [do] [that] ? 
A|66| B: [but] because [of that] _we_ _didn't have_ _very_ [many] pets afterwards _and_ then [he] had _fish ._ 
B|67| M: That _is so_ _weird_ . 
A|68| B: [And] [you] [, they're] [, like] [you] say [, they're] [not] [the most] exciting pet [to] [have] . 
B|69| M: [I think] [they] _are_ [the most] _fun_ [, they're] [just] [not] [as] _fun_ [as [a] dog] . 
A|70| B: _Well ,_ [a] friend [of] mine had _, um ,_ an eel , 
B|71| M: It's [a] _fish ,_ _not a_ 
A|72| B: _and_ then [he] had [a] _, um [,_ I] forget _what_ type [of] [fish] [it was] [, it was] one [of] these _fish that_ [it] [would] eat [, it] ate [a] big other [fish] _and_ things [like] [that .] There [would] be sort [of] moby [fish] [in] [a] tank . 
B|73| M: [I'm] 
A|74| B: _Yeah _,_ and_ [it] [, _I] , I_ couldn't see having [fish] [like] [that .] 
B|75| M: You _mean [,_ he] [, [I] was] _sick [, and_ [I] [, I] [didn't] have] any [fish .] 
A|76| B: [I] _could_ see some having , maybe some [of] [the] tropical [fish ,] _that are_ _really_ , _really_ [pretty] [but] , 
B|77| M: _I mean [,_ _they] do_ [have [a] lot] [of] food [in] [them .] 
A|78| B: Uh-huh . 
B|79| M: Yup [, [we] have a] few [fish [that] are] [, uh ,] [pretty] rare . 
A|80| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|81| M: What ?! [I'm] [not] getting [it .] 
A|82| B: _Yeah _,_ no_ , [that] [would] be , _what_ [did] [they do] , everyone come around [and] watch [them .] 
B|83| M: [I like] [it .] 
A|84| B: _I mean _, I_ guess_ [that's] fine if [you] [have a] _mouse_ _problem_ at your frat [house] [, and] your things destroyed [the] mice . 
B|85| M: Not [really] [. [I] mean , I] [have a] laptop [and] _mouse ,_ [but _I] can't_ use [the] [mouse] anymore . 
A|86| B: [But] , 
B|87| M: It's [not] [really] [a] [problem] _, I [don't_ have] any problems . 
A|88| B: Let's see [, I] had [a] pet rat , [for] [a] while [, and] [it was] [a] _live_ rat [, and] _, um ,_ [this] woman [just] offered [it] [to] me while [I was] [in] , [in] graduate school [and] , she [was] actually _a very_ [fun] pet . 
B|89| M: [Oh [,] that's] [a] good [idea] . 
A|90| B: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [Yeah ,] [he's] [a very] nice guy . 
A|92| B: [Yeah ,] mine had _been a_ , [a] , [a] [how] [did] [this] work , [a] mill rat had _been_ bought [and] [the] [people] [in the] lab one day called [in] _my_ friend [and] said [, you _know] ,_ [this] rat [is] acting [really] strange [I think] [he's] [sick , and] she said [, I don't] [think] [he's] [sick [,] [I] think] she's pregnant , 
B|93| M: You 
A|94| B: [And] [they] had misclassed [the] sex [of] _back_ _there_ [and] [so] _, um ,_ she asked me if [I] want [to] , one [of] those babies [, and I] took [the] baby [and I] got her when she [was] [, you _know] ,_ [just] [this] tiniest little [thing] [like] , half [the] price [of] [a] [mouse ,] 
B|95| M: yes 
A|96| B: [and] then she grew [to] be [, you _know] [,_ I] had pictures [of] her when she [would] sit on _my_ hand [and] then she grew [to] be [pretty] big [, you _know] [,_ like] [a] pound or something 
B|97| M: [I] 
A|98| B: [I don't] [know] [how] much [, and I] had her [for] over two years [and] she [was] [very] affectionate . _She_ [would] [, you _know] ,_ crawl on me [and] she [would] sit [like] on _my_ neck or _my_ shoulder while [I was] working [, and] things [like] [that .] [Yeah ,] much more than [you] [would] [think] . 
B|99| M: [She] 
A|100| B: [Yeah] [and] , 
B|101| M: [and] ... 
A|102| B: _Yeah , [I_ ,] sort [of] [weird] [for] me [to] [have] had one too [but] _there_ [, it was] [a] convenient little pet [to] [have] because [it] stayed [in] its cage [and] [, you _know] [,_ it was] easy . Easy [to] take care [of] 
B|103| M: [my] 
A|104| B: [and] [but] , 
B|105| M: He's [a cat] . 
A|106| B: Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: [I] [know [,] I'm] [just] saying _it's not_ [true] 
A|108| B: Actually [it was] more [fun] than [you] [would] [think] . [Yeah ,] starting from [the] beginning [but] _, um _,_ yeah [,_ we] _live_ , also _live in the city_ now , actually _in Manhattan_ . 
B|109| M: That [was] [fun] [, you know] . 
A|110| B: [And] [so] [it's] almost _impossible_ [to] _, [it's_ not] fair [to] [a] pet [to] [have a] pet here , or certainly , certainly [not [a] dog] , 
B|111| M: I've [never] met [a dog] [that] [could] [do] [that .] 
A|112| B: [I mean ,] [people] [do] , 
B|113| M: They [don't] [, they] [live [in] Manhattan] 
A|114| B: [but] [it's not] , 
B|115| M: [I'm] [not] saying [it's] [impossible] [, I'm] [just] saying [it] [is] . 
A|116| B: [Oh _,] yeah [,_ you] see all these [people] _, yeah ,_ these stately [people] [, and] well dressed [people] [out] walking _their_ [dogs] with _their_ plastic bag or _their_ piece [of] paper [for] [them] _, it's_ [really] kind [of] funny . 
B|117| M: [Yeah , [I] mean [,] it's] [a] real [, uh ,] place . 
A|118| B: Uh-huh . 
B|119| M: Ohhhh [, yeah [,] uh [,] no] . 
A|120| B: Right [, no] [, they] [don't] [. I] should make [you] , 
B|121| M:  ... [and] [we have a] deal . 
A|122| B: [they] [have] _, um ,_ [the] _bags_ behind [them] [but [I] think] [they're] actually supposed [to] , _keep_ [them] [, yeah ,] _keep_ [them] clean 
B|123| M: Are [they] [not] allowed [to keep] [their] [bags] [in the] [back] ? 
A|124| B: [but] , [oh] , gosh [, [I] can't] even walk by Central Park [yeah] when summertime , [just] [the] smell [is so] bad [of] [the] horses . 
B|125| M: You're [a] [bit] late [, they're] [just] getting [there] . 
A|126| B: [Oh ,] well [, [it's] not] [that] _long_ ago . It [was] , [Oh ,] twelve [times] , [of] [the] year . 
B|127| M: [Well [,] I guess [it] was] [the] first [time] [in the] world . 
A|128| B: Uh-huh .
