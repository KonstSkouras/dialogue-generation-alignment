A|0| B: Uh-huh . 
B|1| M: fun . 
A|2| B: Right . 
B|3| M: They _have , uh ,_ _recycling_ . 
A|4| B: Oh . Right . Over here _, they_ [, uh ,] [have] several private companies _that_ _you_ can take [, uh ,] recycled , materials to . But [, uh ,] if _you_ want to take them all to one place _, they_ [have , uh ,] _the_ first Saturday of every month _, they_ [have] certain places _that_ _you_ can drop them off . _That's_ what _I_ _do_ . Uh _, and_ _I_ _, I_ recycle aluminum , glass [, uh ,] newspapers . 
B|5| M:  
A|6| B: So _it's_ nice to [have _,] you_ _know ,_ one place _that_ _you_ can take them all to instead of driving _the_ glass to one place 
B|7| M: That . 
A|8| B: Right . So _it's ,_ so _that's_ nice . It would be , _it_ would be really nice if _they_ [, uh ,] came to _the_ house to pick _it_ up _and_ _they_ just were talking _about_ _a_ bill _in_ Tucson _about_ _that ,_ but [, uh [,] uh ,] _it_ didn't go through . 
B|9| M: i [, I] 
A|10| B: Right . [I] guess what _they_ , what _they_ were talking _about_ here was [, uh ,] was reducing _the_ garbage collection _in_ order to make _that_ up or something _, you_ _know ._ 
B|11| M: That . 
A|12| B: Uh , so [I] guess _that's_ one option . 
B|13| M: I'll [do] [you] think [about] [it] . 
A|14| B: [I] guess one _thing_ they're working on now is [recycling] plastics too . Like [, uh] 
B|15| M: [That's] good . 
A|16| B: [have] [you] noticed _that_ on _the_ bottom of plastic goods _, they_ [have] _this_ little number now _that_ tells what kind of plastic [it] is ? 
B|17| M: [I] think [they] [do] [, and] [it's] [a] good [thing] . 
A|18| B: Yeah [, I] guess _the_ _problem with_ plastic is there's so many different kinds _that_ [you] can't recycle _, you_ can't just throw all plastic into one recycler . 
B|19| M: [I] _have a_ _friend_ [that's] [a] mechanic who's been [in] [the] field for 20 years . He said he has [the] same [problem with] metal . 
A|20| B: Yeah . So now they're like marking [, uh ,] they're [, _I] don't _know_ ,_ there's six , seven , eight different kind of plastics [and] [they] _, they_ mark on [the] bottom what kind [it] is . 
B|21| M: I've seen [this] before , 
A|22| B: So [I] guess _that_ makes [it] easy to recycle [and] then they're , they're [, uh ,] trying to make plastic goods _that_ _don't_ [have a] bunch of different plastics [in] them _, you_ _know _,_ that_ are _, that_ are only made out of one kind of plastic so _that_ _that_ makes [it] easier [I] guess . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: Right . 
B|25| M: [I] 
A|26| B: Where does your [friend] go to to recycle ? 
B|27| M: Don't [, they] don'you , 'they [do] , ' 
A|28| B: Uh-huh . 
B|29| M: I'm sorry . 
A|30| B: Yeah . 
B|31| M: What [about] her ? 
A|32| B: Yeah . 
B|33| M: Uhm ... [I don't [know] .] 
A|34| B: [I] guess [that's] how [it] gets _passed_ on . You _know ,_ when one _person_ _, you_ hear from another _person_ 
B|35| M: She says [that] [in] her voice . 
A|36| B: [and] then [, uh [,] and] then _you [,_ and] then [you] pass [it] on . 
B|37| M: No . Not even [the] [person] who [passed] [it] . 
A|38| B: It seems to be catching on [, uh ,] slowly but surely [, I] guess 
B|39| M: [That's] [the] [thing] . 
A|40| B: Uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [I] [know [,] uh] huh 
A|42| B: Uh-huh . Wow , [that's] cute . [That's] neat , yeah . When _you ,_ 
B|43| M: No , [it's [,] [you] [,] [that] ,] you're . 
A|44| B: Well , when [you] start early [, I] guess ,
