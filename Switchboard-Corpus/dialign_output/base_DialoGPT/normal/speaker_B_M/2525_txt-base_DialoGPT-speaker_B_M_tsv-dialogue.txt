A|0| B: Do _they_ _have_ many buildings _that_ _have_ security _there_ ? 
B|1| M: N 
A|2| B: _Yeah _,_ yeah_ , well _I ,_ _I_ went _to_ Dallas _, uh ,_ when _I_ worked _for_ T _I_ _in_ Abilene _and_ _, uh ,_ _I'm_ _a_ little familiar _with_ _the_ city area , Forest Lane _and_ _, you know ,_ through _that_ , off , off _the_ freeway . 
B|3| M: i ? 
A|4| B: _And_ _, uh _,_ it_ _didn't_ seem _like_ _it_ _was_ _that_ congested _in that_ , _that_ part . _You_ _know_ _because_ _to_ me where _we_ live _out_ _here_ _in the_ north east _, it_ , _it's_ _there_ _are_ _a_ lot _of_ buildings very close _to_ each other , 
B|5| M:  . 
A|6| B: _and_ _the_ cities _are_ very populated _with_ tenement housing , where _there_ _are_ more than one family _in a_ house . _And_ _with_ _the_ _, uh ,_ _people_ _that_ _are_ coming into _the_ _country_ _from_ other countries , _not_ knowing _the_ language 
B|7| M:  
A|8| B: _and_ _, uh ,_ _they're_ _going to_ _the_ big cities . It makes _it_ very difficult . 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: It really does _, and_ _, and_ _I've_ seen _the_ same _thing_ _that_ _you're_ _talking about_ _, uh ,_ _much_ more _crime_ than ever _before_ . Drugs _of_ course _, uh ,_ _a_ big part _of_ _it_ _I think_ . 
B|11| M: i'm [not] _sure_ _if_ i'm missing 
A|12| B: _And_ _, uh ,_ _I _don't_ _know_ ,_ _a_ lot _of_ younger _people_ _, you know ,_ into more violent crimes . 
B|13| M: [uh [,] yeah] . 
A|14| B: _that_ _, that's_ really sad _, you know _,_ you_ got young boys or girls , _that_ at fourteen or twelve years old _that_ _are_ committing murders _and_ , no remorse , _what_ _so_ ever . 
B|15| M: _This [,_ uh ,] reminds 
A|16| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|17| M: _That's_ [a] pretty cool [thing] _to _do_ ._ 
A|18| B: It _is_ _and_ _, and _I_ _don't_ know_ [if] _it's , uh _,_ the_ family _, you know ,_ [thing] where _they're not_ bonding anymore , where mothers _are_ working _all the_ _time_ _and_ _, the_ kids aren't getting _the_ attention _that_ _they_ need , or _the_ television . 
B|19| M: [I don't] [think] [that's] 
A|20| B: _And_ _I ,_ [I] really [think] _that_ _we're_ , _we're_ falling by _the_ wayside _with_ [not] incarcerating these _people ._ 
B|21| M: [I think] [you're] _right_ . 
A|22| B: Uh [, uh] . 
B|23| M: [I think] [that's] [a] 
A|24| B: _Yeah ,_ exactly . 
B|25| M: [And] [it's , uh ,] _prison_ . 
A|26| B: [And] [, uh _,] you know _,_ they_ had [, uh ,] _in_ fact on _the_ news last night _we_ _were_ watching this [, uh ,] man _who_ lost his ten year old daughter . _He_ ran _out_ [to] _the_ store _for a_ few minutes _and_ he had left her home alone . now ten years old , she's old enough _to be_ alone _for a_ few minutes _, you know_ . 
B|27| M: youself 
A|28| B: [And] _while_ he _was_ gone , he had looked , went looking _for a_ job _and_ stopped at _the_ store _, that's_ _what_ _it_ _was_ . [And] [, uh ,] _someone_ _who_ _was _in_ the_ neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , went _in_ , raped _the_ girl , murdered her _, and_ _the_ whole bit . 
B|29| M: [you know] 
A|30| B: [And] one _of_ _the_ men got [, uh ,] [I think] _it_ _was_ seventeen years _and_ _the_ other one _was in_ _for_ [, uh ,] life imprisonment . 
B|31| M: _This_ . 
A|32| B: _The_ one _that_ _was in_ _for_ _the_ seventeen years , actually served seven _, and_ he's _out_ . 
B|33| M: [He] [was [in] a] [time] [out] 
A|34| B: [And] _the_ man _said_ , _that_ _, you know _,_ if_ _it_ weren't _for_ _the_ fact _that_ he _would_ go [to] _jail ,_ _that_ he _would_ eliminate this person himself . [And] _then_ go [to] McDonalds _and_ _have a_ hamburger _and_ [not] [thing] [a] [thing] , [think] [a] [thing] _about it_ . 
B|35| M: [I don't] [think] [so] . 
A|36| B: [And] [I] _mean_ , [I think] _that_ _what_ this _is_ _going to_ lead [to] _is_ _people_ will take things into their _own_ hands . [And] _that_ innocent _people_ , 
B|37| M: _I think it's_ [going [to] be] [a] _good_ 
A|38| B: _I ,_ [I] shouldn't say innocent _, because_ [I] _mean_ , actually _if they_ commit [a] _crime_ _that_ _they're_ _in the_ same circumstances _but_ , 
B|39| M: Well [, the] judge [said] 
A|40| B: [the] reasons _that_ _they're_ doing _it_ compared [to] [the] reason _someone_ else _is_ _in jail_ _for_ _it_ _, you know ,_ [it's] _like_ two different things . 
B|41| M: What [are] [you] [talking about] ? 
A|42| B: Sometimes when [you] lose _someone_ _that_ [you] really love _, you_ [do] some crazy things [I _don't] _know_ ,_ 
B|43| M: [I] [know ,] [I've] _been_ [there] [for a] [while] . 
A|44| B: _I ,_ [I] _like_ [the] idea _that_ [, uh _,] _if_ someone is_ _from_ [a] foreign _country_ _, and_ _they_ come [to] this _country_ _and_ [uh ,] commit , [a] _crime_ , [I think] _that_ irregardless _of_ whether _they_ _have_ already become [a] citizen or anything _, _they_ _should_ be_ immediately deported . 
B|45| M: So ... 
A|46| B: Especially [if] _they're_ found _guilty_ _of_ _the crime_ . 
B|47| M: If [they] [are] [not] convicted , [then] [they] [are] considered _guilty ._ 
A|48| B: _You_ [know ,] once [they] _, they_ _have been_ arrested _and_ _if they_ [know] beyond [a] shadow _of a_ doubt , these _people_ _are [guilty_ .] 
B|49| M: No _, _but_ they_ [are] . 
A|50| B: [That's] _it_ , _we_ [don't] take care _of_ _them_ , _we_ [don't] support _them_ , nothing , 
B|51| M: So [do] _we [have_ a] policy _against_ those [who] [don't know] [the crime] ? 
A|52| B: [I] _mean_ [they] go [right] back where [they] came _from_ . 
B|53| M: What ? [You] [mean] [the] _ones that_ [were] [there] [before] [you] ? 
A|54| B: Exactly _and_ , 
B|55| M: _They_ can't [, because] [they're not] [a] [country] . 
A|56| B: But [that's] [, uh ,] [they're] _, so_ close , _I ,_ [I don't] consider Mexican _people_ _in the_ same category _with_ [, uh ,] especially _like_ [, uh ,] _people who_ come _from_ cultures [that] [don't] [have] [the] same [, uh ,] kind _of_ moral upbringing [that] [we have] . 
B|57| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|58| B: Like [you] take Asian countries , or [, uh [,] the] Eastern countries where women [are] _like_ _in the_ _foreground_ [, uh ,] _in the_ background _and_ [the] men _are in the_ _foreground_ , 
B|59| M: [The] [, uh ,] [foreground] ? 
A|60| B: _and_ [it's] _like_ _, you know ,_ um _, they_ live back [in] where [we] came _from_ two hundred years ago . 
B|61| M: It's 
A|62| B: [You] [know ,] we've advanced beyond [that] _, and [I_ think] [that] their [, uh ,] mentality as far as [the] way [they] treat _them_ _and_ [that] kind _of_ [thing] _, you know_ _what_ [I] [mean] . 
B|63| M:  ... [but] [the] men's bathroom ? 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [I'm] ... _I'm not_ _sure_ [, you know _,] how_ [it] works . 
A|66| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: Wow . 
B|69| M: i . 
A|70| B: Wow . [You] better _believe_ [it] _, if_ [, you] _wouldn't_ even [have] [to] _leave it_ , [I] [mean] , 
B|71| M: No 
A|72| B: _it would_ get snatched [right] off your arm 
B|73| M: If [you] could just [leave it] [in the] car [, [it] would] [be] nice . 
A|74| B: Oh [sure] . 
B|75| M: Well [, the] only [thing] [I] [would] [be] afraid [of] [is] [the] possibility [of a] potential kidnapping [if someone is] _there [,_ and _I] wouldn't_ want [to be] _in that situation ._ 
A|76| B: [That's] amazing , well , _what's the_ difference [there ,] [do] [you know] ? 
B|77| M: Well [I] am [from] Texas [and I] can't [believe] [I] [didn't] [think] [about] 
A|78| B: Oh , _I ,_ [I] [believe] [in _the] death_ penalty , [I] really [do .] 
B|79| M: If [you're] [not] [sure] [, you] [should be] . 
A|80| B: _Yeah [,_ yeah] , [I think] [that] _we're_ too easy . 
B|81| M: So [is] [that] [the death] sentence ? 
A|82| B: Uh [, and] [we] take [the] [, the] [, uh ,] civil liberties [, uh ,] stuff too far . 
B|83| M: [I'm] sorry _, but I _think_ we're_ [all] [out] [of] ideas _here ._ 
A|84| B: [You] [know] _like people_ [that] _are in_ [prison] , [I] [mean] [we] [didn't] put _them_ [there] . [They] put themselves [in that situation .] 
B|85| M: Uhhh , [like _people] who [are_ [in] [jail] [,] uh ,] huh . 
A|86| B: [And] as far as [like] _them_ [, uh ,] entertaining [the] rights [that] _they should have_ . 
B|87| M: Uhh [, uh ,] interesting . 
A|88| B: [I] [mean] , [we] educate _them_ , [we] feed _them_ , [we] take care [of] _them_ [and] [they] no sooner get [out] on [the] street [and] [they're] back [in] again . 
B|89| M: So [what's the] deal [with] [them] ? 
A|90| B: [I'm not] _saying_ [they're] [all] _bad_ [, but I think] [people who _are] guilty_ [of] really serious heinous crimes , [do] [not] deserve [to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] their lives . 
B|91| M: Well [, [if] they] [are guilty] [, they] [are] [not] [bad] [people .] 
A|92| B: [I think] [that] _they [should_ be] put away . 
B|93| M: [Yeah [,] _but] [they_ should [have] been] . 
A|94| B: Get rid [of] [them] . Exactly . _I ,_ [I] really , _I ,_ [I think] [that] _that's the_ whole key [here .] [This] plea bargaining baloney , where [, uh [,] you know [,] they] plead [to] [a] lesser [crime] , or [, uh [,] they] plead [guilty] [in] , or [, you know ,] tell [about] [someone] else [and] [they] [, they] get less [time] , 
B|95| M: [I ,] eh ? 
A|96| B: Or [, if] [they're] [in] [there] [and] they've got seventeen years [and] [they're] on [good] behavior , [for] every year [they're] [in] [they] get [so] many less [, you know ,] [that] [they] [don't] serve [the] full penalty . 
B|97| M: [I'm] 
A|98| B: [I ,] [I ,] [I] really [think we're] [going to] far overboard [with] [all] [of] this . 
B|99| M: H . 
A|100| B: [Yeah ,] same [with] drunk drivers . 
B|101| M: [This] [is] [a] great point . 
A|102| B: [I think it's] too easy [for] [them] . 
B|103| M: So [you're] [saying] _there's_ [a] chance ? 
A|104| B: That [if] [the] [, the] laws [, and] [, and] [were] , [were] harsher [and] [were] enforced , 
B|105| M: Well [I] guess [that's the] law 
A|106| B: [I] [mean] [you] [have] [to] set an example . [You] [have] [to] start somewhere . 
B|107| M: [This] [is] [what] [I'm] [saying] . 
A|108| B: [And] [I think] [that] [people] [know] [that] [they're] [going to] get [a] slap on [the] wrist [, they] might serve [a] little bit [of] [time] [and] [that] they'll [be] [out] on [the] street again . 
B|109| M: [They] [are in the] UK 
A|110| B: An [, it] , an [I] feel [bad] [for] [the] policeman [, because] he's [out] [there] every day facing these [people .] [This ,] this craziness [, you know ,] [people] [with] [, uh ,] automatic weapons [and] [, uh ,] [all] this other stuff [and] trying [to do] [a] job 
B|111| M: Ugh [, [that's] the] [thing] . 
A|112| B: [and] let's face [it] , [what] [do] [they] get paid . 
B|113| M: [I think it's] [because] [the] police [are] trained 
A|114| B: Twenty thousand dollars [a] year [, if] [they're] lucky . [I wouldn't] [do] [it] [for] [that] . 
B|115| M: How [much] ? 
A|116| B: It [is] [, it] really [is] . [And] [I] [mean] , [they're] [the] first [ones that] take [the] brunt [of] everything . 
B|117| M: Is [it] legal [to] [own] [a] 
A|118| B: [You] [know [,] and] [I'm not] [saying] [that] [they're] [all] [good] either [, because] [there's] [good] [and] [bad] [in] everything , 
B|119| M: [I don't] [like] [to] _talk_ [about it] 
A|120| B: [but they] , [they're] already [, uh ,] [have] three strikes [against] [them] when [they're] [out] [there] . 
B|121| M: They're [all the] best [, so] [that's] _all that_ matters . 
A|122| B: Because they'll arrest [someone] [and] [, you know ,] go through [all that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] this [, and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and] [you] [have] [to] even [be] careful [how] [you] arrest [them] [, how] [you] [talk] [to] [them] [, uh [,] you know ,] [what] [they] say ,
