A|0| B: Uh-huh . Well _I_ am _a_ working mother _I_ have three _children_ and my _children_ , since _I_ , uh , since _they_ were very young , I've _had_ various , um , different alternatives , _child care_ arrangements and _like_ most working mothers _I'm_ really not defensive about _it_ . _I_ personally _feel_ , uh , _in_ our particular situation , _I'm a_ much better mother when _I_ work out _of_ _the_ home and my kids _, _I_ think_ , are very , very secure , well raised _children_ . My comment _on_ this _is_ _that_ we paid an absolute fortune over _the_ years for _a_ variety _of opportunities ._ 
B|1| M:  
A|2| B: _So_ _I_ _, I_ _, I_ , _you_ know _, it_ _is_ _a_ problem . And , but as _you_ pointed out _, I_ _, _I_ think_ _the_ real problem _is_ _the_ low pay _child_ facilities and _that_ _is_ sometimes _what_ some women who have _to_ work , _that_ _is_ all _they_ can _afford_ . When our _children_ were very young , we _had a_ pay , _a_ live _in_ paid baby-sitter _that_ _was_ wonderful . 
B|3| M:  . 
A|4| B: And then as _they_ _got_ older , _they_ went _to_ , uh _, I_ preferred _to_ call them schools and _they_ were really all day preschools and _they_ were wonderful . And _I _think_ they_ _got_ exposed _to_ _a lot of_ neat things . 
B|5| M: You . 
A|6| B: But we did , we really truly did pay _a_ fortune . _I mean_ we were paying at one point , well about , about _a_ , close , about five hundred dollars _a_ week for two _children_ . 
B|7| M: [I think] . 
A|8| B: _So_ . 
B|9| M: We [got] married [in] like'09 . 
A|10| B: Well _, I_ _I'm a_ physician . Uh and , as _is_ my husband . 
B|11| M: Why _do_ [you] [think] ? 
A|12| B: And , and [I] felt , uh , very _good_ about working _. _I'm_ a_ pediatrician _actually_ . 
B|13| M: You [feel] [good] ? 
A|14| B: _So_ , uh , but [I think] there are some wonderful _child care_ _opportunities_ out there for _children_ but , and we all know _the_ kind _of_ things _that_ you're supposed _to_ look for . [I think] , 
B|15| M: [I] ... [I think] _so_ . 
A|16| B: Oh . Well 
B|17| M: [I'm a] [child care] nurse . 
A|18| B: [I think] it's real important _that_ [you] have [a] place _that_ , first _of_ all parents have _a lot of_ input into and _that_ they're always welcome and _that_ _they_ have _a lot of_ activities where parents come [in] during _the_ day and _that_ at any time [you] can drop [in] . And we _had a_ really wonderful arrangement , uh , [I'm] _with_ _the_ university _actually_ 
B|19| M: That 
A|20| B: and _they had a_ wonderful , uh , program _that_ started at age three and _it was_ about [a] block away from _the_ hospital where [I] work . And [so] , many times , at lunchtime _, I_ would _go_ over and visit _the children_ and eat _with_ them and see _what_ _they_ were doing . And _they had_ wonderful , _they had_ things _like_ gardens and lots _of_ pets and _just_ , _they had a_ four _to_ one uh , teacher student ratio . 
B|21| M: You 
A|22| B: _So_ _that_ , _that_ sort _of_ an , most _of_ _the_ teachers _had_ degrees . Uh , 
B|23| M:  ... 
A|24| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|25| M: That's [what] [I] said 
A|26| B: It _was_ incredible _actually_ 
B|27| M: This [is] awesome . 
A|28| B: But _it was_ [good] . _I mean_ _it was_ _, it_ , at _that_ time there were two _children_ and _they_ were [in] special programs and each one _was a_ little over two hundred [a] week and then , [in] addition _, I_ paid [a] little bit extra . But _the_ kids were , 
B|29| M: [I think] [it [was] [a] lot] more than _that ._ 
A|30| B: _I mean_ _they_ really _had_ some great _opportunities ._ But , [what] [you] were alluding _to_ earlier [is] , [you] know , women who work for minimal wage and , and really have [feel] _they_ have _to_ put their _children_ , 
B|31| M: _No_ [. I'm] [just] saying [they had [a] lot [of] opportunities .] 
A|32| B: sometimes [they] [do] put them [in] , uh , fairly low paying situations . 
B|33| M: It's [a] sad thing . 
A|34| B: Uh-huh . 
B|35| M: _I don't_ [think they] could [afford] [to] get [on] welfare . 
A|36| B: Uh-huh . [No] , even [that] , [that] really _, [I_ think] _, [I_ don't] , it's been awhile since I've looked at , my youngest [child] [is] eight . _So_ it's been [a] little while since I've looked into , _actually_ daycare centers . But [they] are 
B|37| M: [I'm] sorry 
A|38| B: [you] know _, the_ [good] ones [do] cost maybe sixty dollars [a] week since . 
B|39| M:  ... that's [actually] [a] [good] idea . 
A|40| B: Uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [Yeah] [, [I] mean] [, it] 
A|42| B: Something _like_ [that .] 
B|43| M: what's [a] baby ? 
A|44| B: Well , [you] know , but [you] made _the_ comment earlier , why would someone be interested [in] _children_ . [I mean] [it] has been [a] real , uh , there have been some [good] entrepreneurial type experiences . And [I think] [, [I] [think] they] have captured [a] certain market . Again _the_ , but then there are baby-sitting groups . As [a] pediatrician , one [of] _the_ things we've been real concerned about [is] _the_ infections . 
B|45| M: You [mean] , [like] [, [the] children] ? 
A|46| B: As [you] start putting lots [of] little kids together [, the] infection rates [that] _go_ around 
B|47| M: [So] [I'm] gonna [go] [with] [a] baby .
