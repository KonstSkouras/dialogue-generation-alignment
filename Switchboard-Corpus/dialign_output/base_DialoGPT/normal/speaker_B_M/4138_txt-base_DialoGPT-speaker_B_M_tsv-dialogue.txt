B|3| M: [I] [, uh ,] 
A|4| B: Uh , you're very fortunate . 
B|5| M: How 
A|6| B: We _just_ try _not_ to pay any more in than _we_ have to [, uh ,] _we_ pay in _a_ substantial _amount_ . Uh , 
B|7| M: [I] 
A|8| B: We _don't_ regret paying _taxes ._ We _do_ _think_ that [, uh ,] sometimes [, uh ,] _we_ have _a_ reverse _of_ _a_ _regressive_ _tax_ , _a_ progressive _tax_ . 
B|9| M: _I'm_ pretty sure [we] [don't] [regressive] [taxes .] 
A|10| B: And progressive _tax_ , _I think_ [, uh ,] does _not_ give people incentive to _make_ more _money_ , and _what_ [I] mean by that , _the_ more _income_ _you make_ , _the_ more _tax_ _you_ pay . 
B|11| M: [I think] [we] _should_ [just] [do] [a] [tax] [on] [income] . 
A|12| B: It [should] be , [I think] , [a] flat percentage and [, uh ,] that percentage ought to be _an_ equitable _amount_ . 
B|13| M: What _is_ [the] average [amount] [of money] [you make] ? 
A|14| B: Uh , last year when they passed [the] [tax] laws for [the] [, uh ,] nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one [uh ,] [I] added up all [the] [taxes] that [we] were going to pay [on] all these different specific luxury items and travel _expenses_ and everything else , 
B|15| M: Travel [expenses] . 
A|16| B: and [I] totaled them all up and basically [, uh ,] [we] were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent [tax] . 
B|17| M: Uhhh ... 
A|18| B: Now , that was [the] assumption that [you] spent that same dollar for every , for every item [on] there even though _there's_ [, uh ,] [taxes] [on] different things . 
B|19| M:  
A|20| B: But , [you] know _, there's_ _there's_ [a] lot [of] [taxes] [you] pay that you're _not_ even aware [of] that you're paying [, uh ,] like when [you] buy [a] tire , [you] pay [a] federal excise [tax] . 
B|21| M: _Yeah_ _, I'm_ [a] big fan [of] _this_ idea . 
A|22| B: You pay gasoline [taxes] every time [you] pump something into your , your tank . 
B|23| M: _Yeah_ [, uh [,] there's] [an] 
A|24| B: But [you] probably pay more percentage wise in other [taxes .] 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: [Yeah] if [you] implemented [a] flat percentage , it would encourage people [, uh ,] to [make] more [money] and [the] _, what_ people need to understand in my opinion , now [this] [is] [just] my opinion , okay [, uh ,] [is] that businesses create jobs and jobs create [income] and [income] pays [taxes .] 
B|27| M: [you] 
A|28| B: And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough to say , _here's_ my break point [, I'm] _not_ going to work any harder and [make] any more or create any more jobs . 
B|29| M: No , 
A|30| B: And so , Based [on] that , who [do] [you] [think] you're talking to , you're talking to [an] employer . 
B|31| M: No , [not] [here's] , here [, what] ?
