Sometimes [I] _don't_ , but [I] feel _that_ _, uh ,_ _that_ [the] discipline [it] affords me when [I] [do it] when [I] _don't_ want [to] is also worth something . 
B|16| M:  ... 
A|17| B: And [I] often [find] _that_ even when [I] _don't_ feel _that_ much like exercising , like I'll be really tired , and I'll start swimming , and I'll , and I'll actually get energy . And I'll be , _have_ much more energy when _I'm_ done than when [I] started _, [I_ mean _,] I_ just feel great . That happens [to] me probably one _in_ four or five times _that_ [I] swim . 
B|18| M: [you] 
A|19| B: And that's really [a] terrific feeling , because [you] just [go] _there_ at [the] end _of_ [the] day , and [you] figure , God _, I'm_ ready for bed and [you] exercise and [then] , [it's] sort _of_ painful for [a] while ,
