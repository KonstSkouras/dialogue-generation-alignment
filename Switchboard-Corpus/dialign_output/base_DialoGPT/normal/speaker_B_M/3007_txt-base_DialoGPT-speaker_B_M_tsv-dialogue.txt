A|0| B: Yes . Yes . 
B|1| M: Did _you ever_ _have_ _a dog_ ? 
A|2| B: Yes , well , they were , they really _wanted_ something teeny tiny , and _I_ , uh , really _wanted_ _that_ retriever's disposition . Uh , _the_ ultimate _to_ tolerant , trainable disposition , 
B|3| M: _It's_ _a_ _cute_ _dog ._ 
A|4| B: _so_ _I_ called four or five [dog] trainers because _I_ don't _like_ _the_ little _dogs ._ 
B|5| M: [I] _have_ _a dog that_ likes [to] play fetch _with_ _me_ . He has _a_ leash , [so] _I've_ _been_ _doing_ _it for_ _about_ _a_ year . 
A|6| B: And , and [I] asked _them_ , [you] _know_ , these _are_ _the_ ages _of_ _the_ kids _, what_ do [I] _get_ . And they _all_ said , _Golden_ Retriever and [I] said okay , put [it] under twenty pounds . And _the_ only thing [that] they could come up [with] _was_ [a] Bichon Frize which _is a_ , 
B|7| M:  
A|8| B: Do [you] _know_ _what_ [that] _is_ ? 
B|9| M: [I] [know] _it's_ [a] bichon . 
A|10| B: They're [cute] . _They_ _look like_ an air headed let [me] tell [you] . They're calm , they're _not_ yuppie , they're trainable , they're , uh , very personable in [a] different way [that] [a] _Golden_ Retriever _is_ . They're _not_ dignified _like _a_ retriever_ _can_ be . 
B|11| M: He's [not] 
A|12| B: Yeah . _So_ how old _is your_ _retriever_ ? 
B|13| M: _It's_ [a] _golden_ [retriever] 
A|14| B: Well , actually , [you] [know] _, that's_ _the_ _breed_ standard [for] females . _What_ [you] , 
B|15| M: Looks [like] . 
A|16| B: yeah _, what_ [you] see shown and bred now as _Golden_ Retrievers , _this_ , [you] [know] , plus eighty [to] [a] hundred pound range . 
B|17| M: [So] _this [is_ a] _golden_ 
A|18| B: That [is] [not] _breed_ standard . 
B|19| M: _I've seen_ [them] [breed] [with] [a] _golden_ _retriever ._ 
A|20| B: Fifty-five [is] _the_ minimum but they usually run [about] sixty [to] sixty-five . And _the_ ones [that] _are_ shown , they _are_ inside [that] weight allowance . 
B|21| M: [What] [breed] [is your] [dog] ? 
A|22| B: _You_ cannot show [your] [retriever] if [it's] , [you] [know] , [a] hundred plus pounds . 
B|23| M: Aww [, that's] _what _I_ wanted_ . 
A|24| B: [So] don't say she's _small_ , _just_ say she's perfect . 
B|25| M: She's _a _dog_ ,_ [not] _a retriever ._ 
A|26| B: Uh-huh . 
B|27| M: She's beautiful 
A|28| B: Yep . 
B|29| M: She has [a] [small] nose . 
A|30| B: Well , they _are_ , they _are_ _the_ ultimate [dog] [to] [have] around kids [so] long as [your] kid [is] [not] scared _of_ [a] big [dog ,] because [I] had [a retriever] , actually [I] had [a retriever] Irish Setter cross . Which [is a] really nice animal 
B|31| M: She . 
A|32| B: and fortunately [it] _was just_ _like [a_ retriever] and then [I've] had [a retriever .] 
B|33| M: You're [dog] ? 
A|34| B: It _was_ gorgeous . It _was just_ gorgeous . [I] mean _just_ gorgeous . Um , and they both , [you] [know] , both _the_ half [breed] and _the_ pure [breed] had _the_ , uh _, [what_ I] consider _the_ , _the_ , _the_ perfect disposition . But [you] [know] [what] , [you] [know] [what] scares [me] [about] _Golden_ Retrievers ? Since they've become [so] popular [you] _get_ [what I] call backyard breeders . Which [is] probably where yours came from . People [that] don't [know] [what] they're [doing] , and they [breed] [them] , [you] [know] , [for] [a] certain characteristic . And in _the_ retrievers [it] happens [to] be they [like] [them] big , [for] somehow big [is] perceived as _the_ better . And when [you] start [doing] [that] [you] really tamper [with] , [you] [know] , _the_ , _all_ _the_ , _the_ years _of_ , uh , culling litters and , and , uh , [you] tamper [with] [what] _the dog_ innately [is] . 
B|35| M:  . 
A|36| B: We when _I was_ , when [I] bought my last purebred [retriever] [I] mean [I] looked _all_ over because [I wanted] one [that] still looked _like [a_ retriever] , [you] [know] , _the_ short [to] _the_ ground , stocky , [golden] , uh , trainable , tractable , quiet animal [that] could hunt and still be in _the_ house . 
B|37| M:  
A|38| B: And [I] ended up getting one [that] , uh , came out _of_ [a] , [a] , [a] hunting stock because [I wanted] one [that] could still perform _like [a_ retriever] did . 
B|39| M: [What] ? 
A|40| B: And [I've seen] an awful lot _of_ lately really dumb , dumb retrievers and _I'm_ , and [I] really fear [for] _the_ [breed] because [I] love [that] [breed] , 
B|41| M: [I'm] [so] _much_ 
A|42| B: but [I] really figure right when [it] becomes really popular [that] [it's] going [to] be ruined . 
B|43| M: [You] [can] _get a_ pretty _good_ _dog _that_ can_ handle [a] high level [of] water . 
A|44| B: Oh , yeah . [You] bet [you] . [You] bet [you] . [You] [know] how they came up [with] _the_ [retriever] , don't [you] , _the_ _Golden_ ? 
B|45| M: [Golden] Ret 
A|46| B: It _was_ bred out [of] several different retrievers , and they bred [it for] companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and , and ability [to] hunt . It _was_ kept only by kings . 
B|47| M: [the] . [the] . [dogs .] [are] . _good_ . 
A|48| B: But they selectively culled those litters , [I] mean , [for] many hundreds [of] years and since [it] slept in [the] castle [with] its master , [I] mean [it] had , [it] had [to] be [of] [a] disposition [to] make [it] , [you] [know] , an animal [you] could keep around [that] closely . But they would go through _all_ [the] litters and destroy [the] puppies if they were anything other than perfect . Now , [you] [know] , [that] seems _like a_ cruel thing [to] do . 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: On [the] other hand , [you] sure , [you] [know] , they sure created [a] , [a] wonderful [breed] , [I] mean [a] wonderful [breed] . 
B|51| M: Lol 
A|52| B: Uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [I] 
A|54| B: Well , [I] tell [you] , [you] [know] [the] , [the] _German shepherd_ [is] [the] classic case [of] [what] [I'm] talking [about] because in America [that's] called [a] Rin Tin Tin phenomena . 
B|55| M: [You] . 
A|56| B: Only in America [is] there [a dog] called _a German_ Shepherd . 
B|57| M: [I [was] just] making [a] joke [about] [the dog] being [a German] Shepard . 
A|58| B: That [dog] [is] bred out [of] three European [dogs .] The Belgian Tervurien , [a German] Skutzhund , and [a] makes [a] [I] always forget [the] third one . [I] [can] see _it ._ Uh , uh , but [the] third one [is a] children's [dog .] 
B|59| M: Why does [this] [dog] [look [like] _a] German shepherd_ ? 
A|60| B: And there [are] distinct breeds in Europe . Now [what] happened over here [was] [is] [that] people saw [the] , [the] first , um , which would actually [have] [been] [a] Skutzhund which [is] [what] Rin Tin Tin [was] . 
B|61| M: Wait [, what] ? 
A|62| B: And everybody [wanted] Rin Tin Tin . And [it] [was] known as [a German shepherd] here . [So] they created [a] [breed] standard . The American Kennel Club did . 
B|63| M: [So] . [the] . [it .] [all] . [so] . fine . [it .] 
A|64| B: That said anything [that] [is a] Skutzhund , [a] , [a] Tervurien and , uh , Alsatian [that's] [the] other one . Alsatian , any inner breeding [of] [that can] be called [a German shepherd] here . 
B|65| M: [German shepherd] 
A|66| B: And [what] happened [is] , [is] [that] people [wanted] [this] [shepherd] [to] [shepherd] and protect . And they bred [a dog that] [I] [it's] called [a] , an animal's critical span which basically translates [to] how [much] shit will [it] take before [it] bites [you] . That [German shepherd] , [the] American [German] Shepherd here [was] [a] , [a] , [a] such an unreliable animal [that] [the] American Seeing Eye Institute refused [to] use [them] , because they would turn on on their handlers . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: And even , um , uh , police corps which started , [you] [know] , finding other breeds [to] use because [this] thing , [this] , [this] thing known as [a German shepherd] here , its personality and its dependability and its reliability [was just] terrible . [So] [about] fifteen years ago [the] [German] Shepherd Club [of] America decided amongst themselves [that] they were going [to] change [this] . [So] they went back [to] Europe and brought back some [good] examples [of] each [of] [the] three breeds and bred [to] [a] standard [what] they [wanted] an American [German shepherd] [to] be . Which [is a] very heavily now Skutzhund and Alsatian , 
B|69| M:  
A|70| B: and [it's] [the] Alsatian [that's] [the] kid's [dog .] [It's] [just] , [you] see [them] in Europe and they're [just] lovely . 
B|71| M: [They] . 
A|72| B: But you'll see , [I] mean , if [you ever] start looking in papers now and [you] start seeing these ads [for] [German] Shepherds , they will say on [them] , bred [for] disposition , A K C conforming which means [that] their advertising [that] [this is] no longer an indiscriminate [dog .] 
B|73| M: [I] 
A|74| B: This [is] bred [for] , and they had [to] go through and destroy [a] , [for] [a] while there , [about] seventy-five percent [of] their puppies [that] they bred . 
B|75| M:  
A|76| B: Because they were looking [for] [this] disposition . And nowadays [you] , you'll [get] , you'll [get [a] dog] trainer [to] recommend [a] specific , [you] [know] , breeder handler . [They] will recommend their shepherds as [a] children's [dog .] 
B|77| M: Why ? 
A|78| B: But ...
