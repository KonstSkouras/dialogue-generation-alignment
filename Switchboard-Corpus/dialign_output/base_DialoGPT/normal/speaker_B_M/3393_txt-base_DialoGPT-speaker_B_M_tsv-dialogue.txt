A|0| B: _We_ _did_ an air show out at , uh , out at , uh , Boone Greene , no out at , uh Andrews , 
B|1| M: [We] _got_ _a_ bunch _of_ airshows . 
A|2| B: _yeah_ . _So_ what's _it_ _been_ _like_ up there ? 
B|3| M: _It's_ [been] great . 
A|4| B: Uh-huh . 
B|5| M: Yup , that's why _we're_ _here_ . 
A|6| B: Yeah . Uh _, like_ September was hot _and_ dry , _October_ . 
B|7| M: [October] ? What about [October] ? 
A|8| B: Really ? Huh . It really has [been] strange [here] _this year_ , _I_ mean , _this_ whole _course_ _this_ whole _year_ has _been a_ different _year_ _in_ more ways than one . 
B|9| M: _Well _,_ it's_ _autumn ._ 
A|10| B: But , uh _, we_ had , uh _, you_ know , all these _, we_ have all these , uh , somebody said _, you_ know , _you're_ either [a] stranger or [a] fool to try to predict Texas weather , but . [Well ,] always , they were saying _it_ was going to be _the_ hottest summer ever , 
B|11| M: Uuuh , yoo _, _it_ ._ 
A|12| B: _and_ _we_ had all _this_ rain _, and_ [it] really _is_ _not_ [a] _bad_ summer at all , really cool . But all [of] [a] sudden , _in_ , _in_ , uh , _in_ [October] , uh , September , [October] [it] [got] real hot _and_ dry _and_ just stayed _that_ way for [a] long time . And , uh , then _the_ end [of] [October] [it] started rain almost [a] week without stopping , just pouring down _, you_ know . There were flash floods everywhere , _that_ kind [of] deal _, and_ then uh , into [of] November , _the_ first _, like_ _the_ second week , uh _, you_ know , _the_ first week actually _, we_ had _, we_ had [a] freeze , 
B|13| M: i . 
A|14| B: _and_ _the_ average _, you_ know , _the_ average , uh , first _frost_ _is_ _like_ _the_ fifteenth [of] November [here] 
B|15| M:  
A|16| B: but usually [it's] _not_ until later [It's] really strange . 
B|17| M: _Oh_ _, we're_ [, we] [, and] _it's _,_ you ,_ we've _, it _,_ it's_ 
A|18| B: Yeah . 
B|19| M: _I think_ _we're_ getting [a] [frost] _this year _._ It's_ _a little_ _weird_ . 
A|20| B: Is [it ,] _is [it_ ,] _is it_ flooding anywhere ? 
B|21| M: _I'm_ _so_ glad [I] live [in] Arizona . 
A|22| B: [It's] just kind _of ,_ uh [, we're] supposed to have [a] chance to get some rain _the_ next couple [of] days [here] , uh , which will be [, you] know _, [a_ little] bit more typical , uh , [autumn] weather . But really [it's] strange . [We] haven't really had an [autumn [.] It's] _like_ [we] went into winter 
B|23| M: [So] . 
A|24| B: [you] know , _the_ poor _trees_ , said what 
B|25| M: This [is _it] ._ 
A|26| B: Yeah , uh [, [it's] ,] Yeah , there [, you [,] you] know , usually there's , uh , [I] have [a] farm [a] hundred miles east [of] [here] [in] East Texas [, and] [you] know , all these huge _trees_ just _like_ _the_ eastern hard wood belt all _the_ way up to Maine [, you] know [, it's] _that_ _same_ _trees_ , pines [and] [, and] hard woods [, you] know hickories [and] oaks [and] stuff , 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: [and] , uh , [I] was up there last weekend [, and] there _are_ _trees_ _that_ , _that_ still have their leaves on [, and] they're green , but they're dead You know , _the_ , _the_ freeze just [got] them . They , they weren't ready for [it] at all apparently [, and] [, and] [we] haven't had [a] typical fall at all . Not much color [, you] know , changes have occurred at all . Really [weird] [this year .] [I'm] _not_ sure what _that_ , what _that_ means . 
B|29| M: [I] . 
A|30| B: [So] [you [,] you] all actually had some color , huh ? 
B|31| M:  
A|32| B: It kind [of] crept [in] [and] , 
B|33| M: We've [been a] lot [of] [course] , yea [of [,] like] , [yeah] [, a] lot . 
A|34| B: Yeah [, it's] usually beautiful up there isn't _it ?_ 
B|35| M: [We] [, we] [did] . 
A|36| B: Gorgeous . That's [, you] know , [I think] [you] could drive along [in] Maryland [and] look at _the_ sweet gum _trees_ on each side [and] _the_ [, and] _the_ pines [and] what _not_ [, and] [you] could [, you] know [, you] could be driving along [in] East Texas [and] looks just _the same [._ It's] almost [, you] know , identical kind [of] country . 
B|37| M: [I think] [you're] right . 
A|38| B: Beautiful . 
B|39| M: What's [the] difference between [a] car [and] [a] car ? 
A|40| B: Yeah . [Oh] . Yeah , [I] was up , [I] was up there cutting some firewood [this] weekend , [so] . 
B|41| M: The [trees] [are] [the same .] 
A|42| B: Little , [little] oak tree _that_ was dead [, and] _cut it_ up [and] split [it .] 
B|43| M: How'd [you] [cut [it] ?] 
A|44| B: [Well] . 
B|45| M: [It's] [not] [that] [bad] . 
A|46| B: Uh [, it ,] there's some [trees] [like] [the] oaks [, like] [the] white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . There's , nothing bothers them . Their leaves [are] still green [, and] some [of] [the] other oaks . There [are] [a] few oaks [that] have lost their leaves . Um , what [I] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples , [that] [the] leaves [are] just dead , [the] dogwoods still look , still look [, you] know , they [got] , uh , bit on [the] ends [of] [the] leaves [a little] bit , but they still look pretty good . 
B|47| M:  
A|48| B: It just depends on [the] , on [the] , uh , on [the] tree .
