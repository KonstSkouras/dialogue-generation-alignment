A|10| B: _And , uh _,_ well ,_ give _you_ _an_ _idea ,_ it's three and [a] half miles _of_ dirt road _to_ _the_ concrete _, I_ _mean_ , _to_ _the_ asphalt , we're _out_ there . 
B|11| M: Oh [, well ,] um [, I] _like_ [to] [live] [my] life .

B|15| M:  ... [well ,] good . 
A|16| B: So when [I] drive _the car_ _in the_ , _in the_ driveway _in the_ afternoon , _it_ , _it_ _will_ _just_ drive _it_ up _on_ _a ramp_ _that_ actually puts me _on_ top _of the_ , _the_ [, uh ,] pressure side _of a_ [, uh ,] _hydraulic_ cylinder .

A|20| B: hopefully , it's [not] [my] wife . 
B|21| M: [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|22| B: Well [, I] thought I'd _, you know ,_ I'd use _it_ as [a] , _an_ escapement type thing _. [I_ don't know] if _you're_ familiar with [that] operation _, but_ , _what_ [you] _do_ _is_ [you] _just_ [build] up [the] pressure 
B|23| M: That's [not] [an] escape [, that's] [a ramp] . 
A|24| B: and _then_ [you] _go_ over and release _it_ and _then it_ _just ,_ _it_ _just_ drops _, you [know_ .] 
B|25| M: But [then _it] won't_ , it'll [just [,] uh ,] [just] drop 
A|26| B: Very similar , yeah . 
B|27| M: Like [a] [hydraulic] pump ? 
A|28| B: Well , _what_ , _what_ [it] _will_ _be_ _, you_ [just _,] you_ drive up _on the_ jack _, but_ [you] , [it won't] _go down ._

B|31| M: _If_ [you're] driving [on the] [right] [, you] can [go down .]

B|37| M: Yes [, [I] have] . 
A|38| B: Well , anytime they send me [a] return envelope [I] put _all that_ stuff back _in the_ envelope plus [the] other stuff [that] [I] _, you know ,_ happen [to] gather up . 
B|39| M: What [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|40| B: Because [, uh [,] well ,] [like] [I] _say_ , we [live] [a way] and when [you] throw _trash_ away [, you] throw [it] [in my] yard . 
B|41| M: Why are [you] putting [all that] garbage [in the] [trash] can ? 
A|42| B: _And_ [I don't] _like that_ 
B|43| M: _He_ sighs . 
A|44| B: so [I don't] [do] _that ._ So [I] take [it] and [I] send , and [I] mail [it] back [to] them . 
B|45| M: [I don't] [have] any [. [I] do] [have] [the] receipt . 
A|46| B: _I've_ _had_ four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
B|47| M: You've [had] [a] lot [of] work done 
A|48| B: Yeah . Well [, [I] think] one [of the] , [the] best ways [to] eliminate [, uh ,] or help [the] _recycling_ problem _is_ [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
B|49| M: It 
A|50| B: For instance [, uh , I] saw [a] thing [on] [, uh ,] NOVA [, [I] think] [it] was [the] other day . 
B|51| M: Ugh [. I] hate [you] 
A|52| B: This guy has _designed_ recyclable materials [, I] [mean] recyclable items . 
B|53| M: [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|54| B: Whatever _he_ makes , it's [all] [out of the] same thing . 
B|55| M: [I think] [he] meant [to] [say] [that] [he] [designed] [it] 
A|56| B: See , so , _plastic_ , it's [all] [out of] _plastic_ . 
B|57| M: No _. It's_ [a] [plastic] recycler . 
A|58| B: [If] it's _metal_ , it's [all] [out of] _metal [._ It's] _, he's_ [a] design _, he's_ [a] engineer , designing stuff . 
B|59| M: [It's] [not] [metal .] 
A|60| B: _And ,_ and , incorporating _, you know ,_ reusable materials into your _, uh , you know ,_ your assembly line into your actual scheme [of] product operations _is_ _is_ [the] only [way to] really [do] [it] [on] [a] , [on] [a] broad scale . 
B|61| M: [I] [like] [this] [idea [,] but] [it] [is] very , very impractical . 
A|62| B: Make [it] financially [, uh ,] attractive [to] recycle 
B|63| M: But [the] question [is] , why ? 
A|64| B: and somebody _will find_ [a way to] make money at [it .] 
B|65| M: [And [, uh ,] you know [,] recycling] . 
A|66| B: [And ,] 
B|67| M: [The] people [will find] [another] [way] . 
A|68| B: Well , there [is] [a] guy _in Dallas_ [, that's] [all] [he] does . 
B|69| M: [I don't] [think] [I've] [ever] seen someone [in the] US [say] anything [like [that] .] 
A|70| B: [He] collects [trash] . You [know ,] and , 
B|71| M: What [is] [he] doing [in Dallas] ? 
A|72| B: Yeah [, well _,] he's_ _, he's_ [out] _for_ cardboard .
