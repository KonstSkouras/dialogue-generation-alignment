B|39| M: [No ,] you're [just] 
A|40| B: _and_ [it] always will be _, and_ _and_ [I think] , too , noticing [the] [kids] , _that_ [the] fourth _and_ fifth graders , which is [what] [my] son is _and_ _stuff_ , _they_ , [they're] [just] , [they're] more , [they're] very open . 
B|41| M: [I'm] [so] sorry . 
A|42| B: [I mean] , [the] boys _are_ very open because that's , that's _all_ [I] [have] is boys , [so] that's _all_ [I'm] around basically , is boys , 
B|43| M: _I know ,_
