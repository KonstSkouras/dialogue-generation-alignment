B|0| M: How many _of_ _them_ _were_ students ? 
A|1| B: _I_ rely primarily on _, uh ,_ newspaper combined with television . 
B|2| M: You _, _news_ ._ _and _,_ _news_ ._ 
A|3| B: Uh . 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| B: Okay . 
B|6| M: It's _not_ like _it's_ hard _to_ 
A|7| B: That's rather interesting . 
B|8| M: Hehehe's . 
A|9| B: I'd , I'd have [to] say _I_ haven't either . 
B|10| M: Not . 
A|11| B: _I_ listen [to] _the radio_ _, uh ,_ probably five or six hours a week , but almost inevitably [to] a station that is a classical _, uh ,_ station here , for _music_ purposes . 
B|12| M: helicop . yes .. 
A|13| B: _We_ don't use _the radio_ as a wake up , we have our , a television connected [to] a _, uh _,_ uh ,_ electronic alarm _, uh ,_ system that kicks in , 
B|14| M:  
A|15| B: [and] it comes on with _C_ _N_ _N_ in _the_ morning . 
B|16| M: _And_ [the] [music] 
A|17| B: That we , we wake up [to] television [news] [and _,] uh _,_ uh ,_ shower [and] dress , [and] whatever [to] that , [and] then because [of] [the] fact that my wife [and] _I_ ride [to] work together _, uh ,_ in a car , we , we chat at each other rather than , than something else . 
B|18| M: _So_ ... 
A|19| B: Uh , [and] occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have [the] newspaper sort [of] on our lap on [the] way in , in [the] car , so we have [the] advantage [of] being able [to] _, uh ,_ read [and] drive although there seems [to] _be_ , from what I've seen on [the] freeway recently that a fair number [of] people are reading [and] driving 
B|20| M:  
A|21| B: [So] , we , we rely pretty , pretty heavily , _I think_ , on a combination [of] [the] , [of] [the] two . _I_ also _, uh ,_ use _, uh ,_ NEWSWEEK magazine . Uh , 
B|22| M: [I] 
A|23| B: we tend [to] alternate between NEWSWEEK [and] TIME [and] whatever happens [to] _be_ [the] , [the] _, uh [,_ news] magazine [of] [the] year for us . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| B: [and _,] uh ,_ [I] read sporadically [of] commentary [and] a couple [of] other , you know , trade magazines , [and _,] uh _,_ uh ,_ such as that _, uh ,_ where [I] might read [the] , [the] occasional social [and] even current event commentaries , [and ,] [and] everything as diverse as A _C_ M [to] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ some [of] [the] _, uh ,_ some [of] [the] other tabloids [I] get . [So] _, uh ,_ [I] guess [I] use about eighty percent written , is probably my input [and] twenty percent _, uh ,_ television . _I ,_ _I think_ [I] respect [the] , from a journalistic perspective current events . 
B|26| M:  
A|27| B: I've always said that it , [it's] _really_ [not] interesting unless [it's] three weeks old [and] found its way into a [news] weekly headline . 
B|28| M:  . [and] ,. 
A|29| B: Uh , other than that it was a at best . 
B|30| M: Then . 
A|31| B: Uh , we're probably [not] thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in Raleigh . There , there are other _, uh _,_ uh _,_ _I'm_ not_ sure what you would call [them] , they [the] small _, uh ,_ competing independent sort [of] newspapers . Little small weekly things , but there's only one daily _, uh ,_ called [the] NEWS AND OBSERVER , fondly referred [to] here by some as [the] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ sometimes [the] Noise [and] Observer . 
B|32| M:  ... 
A|33| B: Uh , it depends . _It_ , [it's] , has decent national coverage , but has an extremely focused _political_ coverage , probably steeped in , [the] southern history [and] [the] fact that this is a Democratic State . 
B|34| M: It's [the] ? 
A|35| B: [And] _, uh ,_ consequently everything is filtered through that _, uh ,_ Republican Democratic sort [of] , glass , almost unnecessarily 
B|36| M: Local 
A|37| B: so . 
B|38| M: It's [, uh ,] [political] . 
A|39| B: Yeah , we , we have , that is [, uh ,] as a matter [of] fact they update it once a week with a special section , we , [and] we pay it sort [of] glancing nod . _We_ [, uh ,] have a very good friend who is [, uh ,] tapped into [the] city planning structure . Uh , our developer architect friend [and ,] 
B|40| M: [I ,] 
A|41| B: Right . [So] , _I think_ we find out what's happening in [the] city [, uh ,] on a fairly frequent basis , over a , over a gin [and] tonic sort [of] thing . 
B|42| M: [I think] . 
A|43| B: Uh , [and] that probably gives us a better insight as [to] [the] city [of] Raleigh than , than [the] paper would have anyway . 
B|44| M: You ? 
A|45| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|46| M:  
A|47| B: Uh-huh . 
B|48| M: [It] 
A|49| B: Is that right ? _I'll_ heard there was some stuff on [the] , on _the radio_ that was equivalent [to] _C_ _N_ _N ._ 
B|50| M: [I think] [it's] [the radio] . 
A|51| B: Okay .

A|53| B: Okay . 
B|54| M: [I'll] [be] back , [I'll] [be] _around_ . 
A|55| B: Oh , That didn't [, uh ,] 
B|56| M: You . 
A|57| B: Uh-huh . 
B|58| M: [I'm not] [really] [, I'm] , 
A|59| B: Uh , we probably [were] listening [to] [C] [N] [N] fairly heavily before [the] war broadcasts began . Uh , we almost live [and ,] [and] breathed it for , because during [the] war itself [to] [the] point where we began [to] sort [of] have household pact [of] lets turn [the] war off [and] get something done . 
B|60| M: [N] 
A|61| B: Uh , almost an addition [, uh ,] [and ,] [and ,] [and] we could equate or relate relay well [to] some [of] [the] newspaper [and] television articles about [the] fact that people where having this problem in , in unhooking , uncoupling from [the] events , [and] going on with their . [So] , 
B|62| M:  
A|63| B: instead [of] being , watching [the] missiles [and] being glued [to] [the] tube or whatever . Uh , [and] because [of] that we began towards [the] middle [and] [of] [the] war , [I] guess about two [and] a half or three weeks in , we began [to] restrict our [news] almost deliberately where we would [, uh ,] watch [, uh ,] fifteen minutes before , fifteen minutes after six our time which would [be] national [news] , or our local [news .] _We_ would watch [C] [N] [N] until six thirty , then we would watch [, uh ,] a rotating network [news] [of] either [, uh ,] A B [C] , [C] B S , or [N] B [C] [and] we , we sort [of] just rotated [around] [the] dial each night a different one . 
B|64| M:  
A|65| B: [and] then we would turn [the] television off [and] we [were] sort [of] limiting or dieting ourselves on , on [news] that way . [And] , then we would do a similar thing [, uh ,] at [uh ,] ten forty-five because [, uh ,] [C] [N] [N] would [be] wrapping their hourly coverage up [and] then we would get [the] local coverage [, uh ,] [and] then [I think] [the] local coverage we would tend [to] watch [the] same station that would , would have better state coverage rather than local coverage . Uh , three [of] [the] networks here , on their local [news] [, uh ,] that if , if you wish [to] listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who , murdered who , or stole what . from whom . 
B|66| M: :Yeah . adays . 
A|67| B: [And] , that was [the] sort [of] thing that [I] would say is [the] best MUMBLEx [and] [not] [news] 
B|68| M:  . 's 
A|69| B: unless there's some trend or something that says , Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever . Uh , that's , that's sort [of] more [of] , [of] a pattern [news .]
