A|0| B: _Yes_ , we're _not too_ long distance _today ._ 
B|1| M: Are _you_ guys still going ? 
A|2| B: _Oh ,_ _that_ was good . _Utah_ , I've had _a_ couple _of_ , but _that_ was _it_ . 
B|3| M: You must be from _the_ east coast 
A|4| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|5| M: You know _, I'm_ [not too] sure . 
A|6| B: Learned _about_ their basketball _team_ 
B|7| M: Did _you_ learn [about] _the_ [Utah] _Jazz_ ? 
A|8| B: Uh , [Jazz] . 
B|9| M: Which [team] ? 
A|10| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|11| M: He's [a] [Jazz] fan . 
A|12| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| M: _Well_ . They were _in_ [Utah] _for_ [a] while . 
A|14| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|15| M: _I_ mean . [Yeah .] 
A|16| B: [I] am . 
B|17| M: _I'm_ confused . 
A|18| B: Okay . 
B|19| M: _I'm_ [not] . 
A|20| B: Nancy . 
B|21| M: You mean _to_ say _what_ ? 
A|22| B: Right .

A|24| B: Right . 
B|25| M: _I'm_ Brian . 
A|26| B: Right . 
B|27| M: _I don't_ _think_ _I can_ give _you_ [a] _job ._ 
A|28| B: Uh-huh . [Well] [, I'm] _a little_ different _than_ other people _because_ [I don't] _have_ _benefits_ with _my_ [job .] 
B|29| M: Are _you_ going _to_ be able _to_ _pay for_ yourself ? 
A|30| B: [I'm] [a] nurse and [I] _work_ , 
B|31| M: [I don't] know . What's your [job] ? 
A|32| B: [I] float _so_ _that_ _I have_ no _benefits_ except higher [pay for] doing _that ._ 
B|33| M: What _do_ _you_ mean ? 
A|34| B: So [I] find _that_ _it_ makes up [for] [what] [I] [pay for] _insurance_ and [I] _, I_ make enough _money_ by [the] hour [to] make up [for] _that ._ 
B|35| M: It's [because] you're [not] getting any [benefits] 
A|36| B: Right . Uh-huh . 
B|37| M: What _do_ _you_ mean ? 
A|38| B: [Yeah] _, it's_ cheaper [for] me [to] buy _insurance_ by [the] month _than_ [to] _work_ staff someplace . 
B|39| M: Ah , [so] _you have to_ [pay] more [than] [the] cost [of] [the] [job] ? 
A|40| B: And then _I have_ _my_ freedom . [I can] _work_ seven days [in] [a] row and take [a] _week_ off or whatever [I] want _to do_ . 
B|41| M: The only _thing_ [I can] _think_ [of] _is_ _you_ being _paid_ [for] your time . 
A|42| B: [Well] , _it_ [is] [to] me . Most people prefer [the] security [of] nine [to] five , and weekends off and knowing _that_ their _insurance_ [is] [paid] and their _retirement ,_ 
B|43| M: _I'm just_ [not] sure how [it] would be financially wise [to do] [that .] 
A|44| B: and [I'm just] _really_ [not] interested [in] all [that .] 
B|45| M: _I think_ [it's] mostly [the] first one . 
A|46| B: Uh-huh . 
B|47| M:  ... You know [, I'm] [not] sure . 
A|48| B: Right . 
B|49| M: [Yes] ... 
A|50| B: [Yeah .] Right , and especially if [you _have] a_ family . 
B|51| M: You've got [to] get some 
A|52| B: Then [I think] [it] makes [a] big difference . 
B|53| M: [I think] [the] group discount [is] [a little] more important [than] [that .] 
A|54| B: [Yeah .] 
B|55| M: Do _you have to_ be [a] parent [to] [have a] [job] ? 
A|56| B: Right . 
B|57| M: [I have] [insurance] . 
A|58| B: _Oh ,_ yeah . 
B|59| M: The [work] schedule . 
A|60| B: Right . Could [you] change [that] as [you] felt like [it] or did [you have [to] do] [it] [the] same _every week_ ? 
B|61| M: [every week] 
A|62| B: Uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [I] . 
A|64| B: [Yeah .] 
B|65| M: [Yeah .] [I'm] [really] enjoyed [it] 
A|66| B: [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: you're ... flexible ? 
A|68| B: _Oh , well , I_ guess , _retirement ,_ [that] kind [of] [thing] which [I don't] worry much [about] [so] 
B|69| M: [I] mean [, it's] [just] an example . 
A|70| B: _I just_ prefer [to] worry [about] _today_ , probably [not] [a] practical attitude but that's [who] [I] am [so] , 
B|71| M: [I don't] [really] care [about] [my] [retirement [,] [I'm] just] here [for] [the] [money] . 
A|72| B: Uh-huh . 
B|73| M: [Oh , well , [I] just] feel better [about] myself [today .] 
A|74| B: Right .
