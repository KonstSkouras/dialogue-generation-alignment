A|0| B: The area _I work_ in , _it_ , _it_ primarily have maybe _a_ hundred _people_ or so . 
B|1| M: _I don't_ _think_ _that's_ [a] _small_ city . 
A|2| B: So [that's] make up most _of the_ laboratory so from , from _that_ standpoint , it's pretty [small] it's pretty [small] . 
B|3| M: It's mostly [the] size [of the] lab . 
A|4| B: _What_ about yourself ? 
B|5| M: _That's_ _true_ . 
A|6| B: Oh , okay . 
B|7| M: She's [a] scientist , she _can_ _do_ anything . 
A|8| B: Oh , okay . [I] see . 
B|9| M: I'm [a] student _, and_ [I work] with [the] [people] _down_ _there_ . 
A|10| B: Oh , okay . Right . _Uh ,_ 
B|11| M: _I mean_ _, you_ _can_ _just_ _say_ _that ._ 
A|12| B: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|13| M: _You're_ 
A|14| B: Well those [and] probably [the] security aspect [of] _it_ . 
B|15| M: [What] _is_ important ? 
A|16| B: Because [a] lot [of] time nowadays , _even_ though you're working , uh , you're treated [, and] _it_ may _not_ _be_ [true] in every _place_ . In [a] lot [of] cases _I think_ you're treated more like [a] number instead [of] [a] , [a] person . 
B|17| M: Why _would_ [I] want _to_ go _to_ [a] [place] where [I] _can_ _do_ [it] ? 
A|18| B: Because when [it] come [down] [to] layoff , they [don't] really consider [people] [and] [, and] [, _you] know ,_ their well being as far as [, _you] know ,_ how they going , their next dollar going [to] come in . How they going [to] pay their bills . They [just] lay them off . 
B|19| M: Lol ' 
A|20| B: And [I] was reading _this_ book one time about _this_ guy [that] had , uh _, I think_ [the] _company_ still exists . [What] they use [to] [do] [is] , they used [to] cut [the] number [of] hours _for_ everybody as opposed [to] [just] laying [people] off _you know_ . 
B|21| M: [I think] 
A|22| B: That way [that] [, _you] know ,_ one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time . 
B|23| M: I'm [not] [even] 
A|24| B: And , uh [, _you] know , I think_ if they had programs [that] set up [to] subsidize [people] [that] [do] get laid off [a] little bit better [, _you] know ,_ other than _you know ,_ something like , unemployment [is] good but [I mean] [the] _company_ as [a] whole because [you] as an employee , [even] [the] _company_ [is] making money , they paying [you] [a] salary but [you] are responsible _for_ [that] _company_ growth . [You're] responsible also _for_ helping [that] _company_ get [to] _the point_ [that] it's at at making profits . So [there] should _be_ something in [there] or some kind [of] clause [that] will subsidize [people] if they did lose their job other than [, _you] know ,_ uh , neglect or something like [that .] 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: _You know_ . Because it's [not] [a] person's fault [that] [, _you] know ,_ [people] [not] buying or businesses are , are [not] on [the] up [and] up all [the] time [, _you] know_ . [I don't] see how one or two [people] , maybe more one or two , but [, _you] know ,_ [a] number [of] [people] [can] , _can be_ [the] downfall [of] _a company_ situation . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: Well in [a] sense [that] [say] , how [do] [you] make [a] , [a] conclusion [that] you're going [to] lay off these ten [people] . _Uh ,_ _for_ [the] bad times [of the] _company_ . 
B|29| M: [you] . 
A|30| B: [What] about [the] , [the] [work] effort those ten [people] did when [the] _company_ was doing well . 
B|31| M: [I don't] ? 
A|32| B: _You know_ . In [that] standpoint . 
B|33| M:  ... [Uh ,] what ? 
A|34| B: yes _, I_ _do ._ 
B|35| M: Do [you] [work] [for] [a company] ? 
A|36| B: [I] really _do ._ [I think] it'd _be_ better [that] way [and] [even] at [that] , [it] [would] at least give [the] person time [to] look [for] another job because they _know_ [that] [that] [there] are problems 
B|37| M: [You [know] [,] you] [do .] 
A|38| B: [and] [, _you] know ,_ [there] are reason [to] look [for] another job instead [of] [just] dumping [it] on them all at one time . 
B|39| M: [you know , I think] _that would_ [be] [a] great idea . 
A|40| B: [You know] . [That's] [just] , [that's] my views [, [you] know] . 
B|41| M: [I don't] [think] [you] understand [the point] [of] [this] post 
A|42| B: Right . Right . Right . 
B|43| M:  ... 
A|44| B: Well at least [that would] give [a] person [a] chance [to] look [you know] . Because [the] way [it] [is] , [a] person really [don't] have [a] chance 
B|45| M: [You] [can be] ?
