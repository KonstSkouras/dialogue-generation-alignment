B|5| M: _Oh_ . 
A|6| B: _yeah ._ So _what_ _do you_ _do_ up there ? 
B|7| M: _He_ smiles [and] nods

A|12| B: Yeah . 
B|13| M: _I don't know what_ [to] say . _it's just_ _something_ _I've_ noticed . 
A|14| B: Really . Gosh . 
B|15| M: Well , _I've_ [been] watching [the] show [for] [the] _last_ _year ._ 
A|16| B: [Oh ,] boy 
B|17| M: Well , they're _all_ tomatoes . 
A|18| B: _that_ sounds wonderful . 
B|19| M: _I_ [have to] make _some_ [of] those plants [and] tomatoes . 
A|20| B: If [you] [don't] _have a_ frost you'll be [all] right That's [what] [I] remember from living up north , is _that_ you'd get everything set [and] then you'd _have a_ frost [and] half [the] stuff would get frostbitten _, and_ you'd [have to] . 
B|21| M: _I don't [know_ [,] but] _it's_ [the] same _as_ _it's_ _always_ [been] . 
A|22| B: Wow . Uh-huh . 
B|23| M: [You] . 
A|24| B: [Oh ,] boy _, that's_ frustrating . 
B|25| M: You're [, and] 
A|26| B: [Oh , yeah] , _my_ husband does _that_ , thank goodness , because [I] _, that's_ not [a] pleasure [for] me 
B|27| M: Ahh [, that's] interesting . My son _and _I_ do_ [the] mow [the] grass . 
A|28| B: [I] love gardens _that_ _are_ well tended [, [and] _I] just_ , there's [been] [a] few different places [I've] lived where [I've] [just] [I don't know] whether [it's] little old ladies living there or [what] [, but] [you] could [just] tell _that_ they had [a] love , [uh ,] [a] love affair with their gardens , with beautiful wild flowers [, and] [just] _, I_ love [the] host [of] colors _that_ [just] keep coming [all] , [you] [know ,] [year] _long_ . And , [uh _,] I_ _, I_ was _in_ England once [, and] [that's] one thing _that_ impressed me so much is no matter [what] size yard somebody had , they had [a] beautiful _garden_ _in_ it . [You] [know ,] it could be three feet by four feet or [something] . 
B|29| M:  
A|30| B: So [I do] admire _that_ [, but] [I] haven't really put , [uh ,] _too_ much energy into it . Course we [have] two little kids _that_ _are_ two [and] three years old 
B|31| M:  
A|32| B: So _that_ [has] put [a] crimp _in_ _my_ every activity other than diapers [and] laundry , I'll tell [you] 
B|33| M: The . 
A|34| B: [yeah] [, that's] really lovely . [I] would love [to] [have] different fruit trees . It's [, it's] [been] wonderful [to] [have] [the] peaches . They're [just] delicious . And , we , we we [have] , still [have to] spray [some] [, but] we [don't] [have to] [just] asphyxiate ourself with [the] poison , which is _good ,_ because _I just_ _, I_ can't _see_ [the] point _in_ doing _that_ [and] eating anything [out] [of] it afterwards . 
B|35| M:  
A|36| B: Um , we've tried them [, but] again [, it's just] like [the] sun scorch . 
B|37| M: [You] ? 
A|38| B: We've tried them _in_ kind [of] halfway _in the_ shade [and] halfway _in the_ [I] [mean] [it's just] , [you] really , really [have to] be prepared [to] _water_ constantly during [the] Summer . 
B|39| M: How [long] _, what_ ? 
A|40| B: People _that_ [have] [been] successful [out] here _have done_ this drip irrigation [and] installed _that_ , 
B|41| M: [We [have] done] _that ._ 
A|42| B: [and] um [, that's] really [what] makes [the] most sense , because [you] [don't] [have to] use so much _water_ [, and] 
B|43| M: [We] [do] [have a] [water] system . 
A|44| B: it really does [the] job . But [it's just] amazing how hot [and] dry [and] [for] how [long] it gets [out] here . And if you're not really committed [to] it _, I_ [mean] , me , _I'm_ , [you] [know ,] _I'm_ real committed [to] it [for] about [a] week [, and] then [I] forget about it [for a] week [, and] then [I] go , [Oh , yeah] _, I_ need [to] [do] [something] [, and] by then [it's] burned up , [you] [know] . 
B|45| M: I'e ? 
A|46| B: It's [just] _too_ distracting right now with these little ones _in_ our lives , so maybe when [I] get older I'll find , [uh ,] [some] joy _in_ [that] 
B|47| M: [I'm] [too] 
A|48| B: Yeah . Yeah , it [just] gets so hot so fast here . [We] [don't] [have] really [a] Spring or [a] Fall 
B|49| M:  ...

B|51| M: [You] ? 
A|52| B: [We] [always] had gardens when [I] was , [uh ,] living _in_ Chicago . In fact , _my_ mother once tore up our entire back yard [and] redid it . I'll never forget . Got _my_ stepfather [to] put _in_ , [uh ,] [a] waterfall [and] [a] little pond _in_ one corner . [I] [mean] , [that] was like [the] most energy invested _in_ anything _in the_ whole time [I] ever knew him They remodeled [the] entire back yard . Then they sold [the] house [and] got divorced , so [I don't know what] [that] says about it [all] 
B|53| M:  
A|54| B: [Oh [,] but] she used [to] love [to] [do] stuff like [that .] 
B|55| M: Sheroflip . 
A|56| B: Yeah , it really was . [I] enjoyed it there . But maybe when [the] boys get [a] little older , we'll [do] [some] more planting , because they like [to] _see_ things grow . They've [done] [a] couple [of] little seed projects [, and] so _I think_ it would be fun [for] them . 
B|57| M: That ? 
A|58| B: Yeah [, yeah .] 
B|59| M: [I'm] sorry _, I think_ [I just] saw [you] [in the] [garden] [of] [my] friends . 
A|60| B: [Oh ,] yes They're both running around now . 
B|61| M: [I don't] [think] [you can do] [that .] 
A|62| B: Yeah , well [, it's] very therapeutic [, I think] , really [to] get [out] there [and] dig [in the] dirt , [you] [know] . 
B|63| M: Ah [, I] [see] . 
A|64| B: They certainly enjoy [that] part [of] it It's [just] trying [to] keep anything . [I] planted bulbs [last] , [uh ,] Fall on [the] side guard [, and] when [I] went [out] there [in the] Spring [and] [the] first [day] they came [out] [the] little one went [and] pulled [all] [the] flowers off [, and] [the] flower petals were scattered [all] over [the] walk 
B|65| M:  
A|66| B: [He] thought [, what] _are_ these fun toys [that] mommy put [out] here with [all] these colors [for] me [to] play with ? At least he didn't eat them [, I] [mean] [, I] guess [I] could be thankful [for] [that .] 
B|67| M: [I'm] sorry 
A|68| B: Yeah , really . If they survive this [year .] [Oh ,] well , _good_ luck [to] [you] .
