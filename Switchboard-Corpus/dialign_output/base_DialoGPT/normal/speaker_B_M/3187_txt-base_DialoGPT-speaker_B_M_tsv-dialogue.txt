A|0| B: Um , well _, the_ , see , uh , well , we , he wanted _to_ get into _a_ Mennonite nursing home which _is_ _very_ popular _and_ hard _to_ get into _and_ had like _a_ ten year waiting _list_ 
B|1| M: You ? 
A|2| B: right , we wound up just choosing _a_ , another Mennonite nursing home _that_ _was_ easier _to_ get into . Or but naturally , _no ,_ it _was_ even Mennonite related , _I'm sorry ,_ it _was_ actually _not_ _a_ particularly great nursing home . Mostly _the_ thing _was_ _that_ it _was_ available when we needed it , because he suddenly got sick _and_ needed _to_ be put in . 
B|3| M: [that] . 
A|4| B: Uh , _what_ do _you_ _think_ ? 
B|5| M: [no ,] i' 
A|6| B: Uh-huh . 
B|7| M: It's awwwwwww . 
A|8| B: Yeah . 
B|9| M: Uhm ... [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|10| B: Yeah 
B|11| M: So , did [you] _have_ [a] choice ? 
A|12| B: yeah , that's important _I_ would say . 
B|13| M: You can always move her out _of_ [the] _house_ . 
A|14| B: Okay . 
B|15| M: [I] _have_ [a] friend [that] works there . [I'm] sure she can give [you] [a] [list] _of_ [what] she's doing [and] [what] she [is] doing . 
A|16| B: Yeah . 
B|17| M: Yourself . She's 
A|18| B: Right , [and] [that] becomes difficult then . 
B|19| M: She's [not] there anymore . 
A|20| B: Uh-huh . Yep , we tried _to_ convince my grandfather _to_ live with us at several points during [the] last few years [of] his life , but he _was_ essentially too proud [and] too independent so [that] even though his heart _was_ getting incredibly weak [and] his knees were going bad he lived in his own [house] as long as he could 
B|21| M: [I] 
A|22| B: but he _was_ living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up [the] steps _to_ [the] top without [a] great deal [of] pain , 
B|23| M: [I] [think] . 
A|24| B: [and] this , eventually things just went too far 
B|25| M: [I] [was] [not] talking about [that] , [I] [was] talking 
A|26| B: [and] he allowed himself _to_ be put into [a] nursing home . 
B|27| M: He [was] [a] [very] nice man . 
A|28| B: Right 
B|29| M: [I'm] [not] really [a] guy . 
A|30| B: well that's , yeah , that's right [that] [the] children [have] some _responsibility_ , too , _to_ their parents [and] such , _to_ help decide what's [the] right thing . 
B|31| M: [I] mean [, the] kids'parents [have] [a] [responsibility] [to] take care [of] them . 
A|32| B: And . 
B|33| M: She [is] here . 
A|34| B: Uh-huh . 
B|35| M: [I'm sorry ,] [I] don't know . 
A|36| B: Yep . 
B|37| M:  ... Is she ?
