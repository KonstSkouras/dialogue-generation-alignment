B|1| M: Why 
A|2| B: so _I_ get it from T V a lot . _I_ get TIME _I read_ TIME MAGAZINE Um , that's one _I read_ pretty regularly . 
B|3| M: [I read] 
A|4| B: And , uh . The thing about it , you _know ,_ now _that_ I've found , _is_ _that_ we get such good coverage on T V , or at least such _, I_ don't _know ,_ attempted thoroughness of coverage , by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE , there's nothing in it you don't _know_ . 
B|5| M: No , [I'm] there . 
A|6| B: Right . Then you can _just_ sort of have pictures to go along with it or something , because really , I've thought lately , there's nothing new in the TIME MAGAZINE . 
B|7| M:  ... 
A|8| B: _You_ _know ,_ it's , it's , basically you've heard everything 
B|9| M: That's magaz ... 
A|10| B: and , uh , you might , you might get a little more thorough , uh , account of something , but really , um _, I_ don't _know_ . So [I] get most of mine from television

A|12| B: [I] _would say_ . 
B|13| M: [You] [would say] [that] ? 
A|14| B: Right 
B|15| M:  
A|16| B: and [I] _, I_ think there's an attempt to do _that ._ [You] _know , I_ think people , there's a mild attempt for [that] , but [I] think basically , we basically associate _news_ with bad _news_ or , or catastrophes or problems or crises , or , uh , you _know_ . 
B|17| M:  ... 
A|18| B: [I] think our concept of _news_ isn't necessarily events [that] happen . It's more negative , like you said . 
B|19| M: This [is] not [news] . 
A|20| B: But _, I_ think people try to , on , on T V [I] think , they try to throw in good stuff , but it doesn't , uh , it doesn't sway the vote . 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: Uh-huh . 
B|23| M:  ? 
A|24| B: Uh-huh . 
B|25| M:  ... 
A|26| B: Right . [You] _know ,_ the war last winter _was_ certainly a good example of [that] because we saw every single thing , practically . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: [I] mean , you _know , I_ remember , well , _just_ the things [that] are covered . [I] remember watching the World Series during the earthquake , and _just_ seeing [that] happen 
B|29| M: I' 
A|30| B: [I] mean , you _know ,_ [that] _was just_ so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the , and the announcers , you _know_ grabbing , 
B|31| M: [I'm] 
A|32| B: [I] mean , it's like , [that] _was just_ something because [that] _was_ like live and real like you said , 
B|33| M: [I] [know , I] [was just] saying [that .]
