B|69| M: _I ,_ i'm ... 
A|70| B: yeah [, and] [so] you're basically [you] sit there [and] wait for something exciting [to] happen [and] when [it] happened [he] missed [it] [, and] didn't understand [it] Um , [he] grew up out , well , [he] grew up [in] , which [is the] , sort [of] O strip east [to] west , eastern part ,
