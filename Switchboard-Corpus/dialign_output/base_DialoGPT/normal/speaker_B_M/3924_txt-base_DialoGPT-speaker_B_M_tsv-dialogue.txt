B|24| M: Uhh , you're [not] [very] good 
A|25| B: But whether or [not] [it] [would] [be] [, uh ,] our [money would] [be] better spent [, uh ,] teaching , [you] _know_ , working on [the] drug problems [and the] [, and the] sex problems [, uh ,] rather [than] trying [to] cure [the] [people] [that] already _have it ._

B|32| M: [yes .] 
A|33| B: And [I don't] _know_ that's true or [not [.] I] mean [, I] just heard [it] [in] passing _, but_ so [what] does [that] , 
B|34| M: [I don't] . 
A|35| B: [what] does [that] mean [for] [people] [that] [you] _work with_ _and shake_ hands _with_ [and] 
B|36| M: [I] [work with] him [and shake] his hand 
A|37| B: Yeah . 
B|38| M: It's [not] [a] virus . It's [a] virus . The same thing as [the] flu virus . 
A|39| B: Uh-huh .

B|44| M:  
A|45| B: Oh . 
B|46| M: You [know] . 
A|47| B: [I think] maybe more information should [be] given out about [it .] 
B|48| M: We _do_ [know] [that] [the] effects [of] [it] [are] [very] much different .

B|50| M: It's [not .] 
A|51| B: Uh-huh .

A|53| B: Ri- , _Exactly ._ 
B|54| M: Are [you] sure [you] [are] dying ? 
A|55| B: And [why] can't [you] , [why] can't [the] F D A say , [you] [know] , [if] these [people] knowingly consent [to be] , [research] monkeys [and] well , let them , 
B|56| M: [I'm not] going [to] answer [that] question , you're [not] [the] same guy . 
A|57| B: let them , _do it ._
