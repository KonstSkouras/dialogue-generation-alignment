B|19| M: [I] love [you] . 
A|20| B: The kids , [they are] real people _and_ [they are] interesting _and_ , [they] , [they] [have] all their own activities _and_ , um _, [I_ think] as parents we really enjoy them _in_ , _in_ our personal situation our children [have] [not] yet decided [to] rebel 
B|21| M: [I] can't

B|25| M:  ... 
A|26| B: Are [you] Mormons ? 
B|27| M: _That's_ how [I] _got_ [my] _wife_ [and] [my] wife's friend 
A|28| B: [That's] [what] [the] Utah [and] [the] large _family_ . 
B|29| M: Yeah _. They_ _have a_ nice house . 
A|30| B: [Well ,] we're Catholics [. _I] came_ _from a_ _family_ of five [. I] _had_ four brothers , 
B|31| M: [Well , [I] came] [in] [from a] dead _family _,_ so_ [I'm] [not] [sure] [if] [that's] how [it] works . 
A|32| B: [the] only _girl ._ 
B|33| M: Which [one] ? 
A|34| B: And everyone always asked [if] [the] _girl_ [got] spoiled . 
B|35| M: _I don't know ._ I've _never_ [had] [a] [girl .] 
A|36| B: [I] [never] felt spoiled . In fact [I] always thought [my] toys _were_ destroyed 
B|37| M: _I don't know_ [if] _it's_ _because_ _I'm a_ [girl] _but _I_ feel_ _that way ._ 
A|38| B: [No] . Usually busy fighting for survival . 
B|39| M: What's up [with] [the] guy [in] [the] picture ? 
A|40| B: [Well , [I] do] [think] [with] working parents [it] is [, I] mean , there [are] some real issues here . Um , [that] [I think] , um , 
B|41| M: _It's a_ good _thing ._ 
A|42| B: [I don't know .] [It's] an interesting problem [. I] happen [to] , um [, [I'm] a] pediatrician . 
B|43| M: What [about] [it] ? 
A|44| B: My husband is [a] physician [, so] , uh [, I] [, I] [I] talk [to] parents [about] [this] [a] lot . But children [, I] [, [I] think] working mothers [or] mothers who choose [to] work outside [the] home , um , need very early [to] come [to] grips [with] any guilt , [that] [they] [feel] [and] decide what's best for them [and] their [family] . 
B|45| M:  ... 
A|46| B: And [I feel] when [my] children _were_ very young [, I] [had] jobs [that] helped me be flexible [with] [my] schedule [and] spend time [with] them [and] all [that] sort of [thing .] And [I] long ago decided [I'm a] better mother [because] [I] work outside [the] home . 
B|47| M: [You] . 
A|48| B: [I] really believe [that .] And [it] has , um , helped us [to] afford some things for our children [that] we couldn't otherwise [that] [I think] [are] wonderful particularly at [this] age , [and] [I think] our kids [are] real secure . And [have a] real sense of priorities [and] [that] [they] can [do] anything [and] be anything both male [and] female [a] lot 
B|49| M: [I] . 
A|50| B: [so] [I] [know] [it] sounds [like] [a] rationalization [but] [it's] [, I] really [think] [it's] true for our [family ,] [and] [I think] [it] has worked very well . 
B|51| M: [You] 
A|52| B: There's no question [, [I] think] [that's] really [the] best . If , [if] [a] woman is happy doing [that] , 
B|53| M: _your_ [right] . 
A|54| B: _I hate to_ put [it] quite [that way .] 
B|55| M: [Well] [I hate to] say [it] _, but_ ... 
A|56| B: [I] was twenty-nine when [I] [had] [my] first [child] [and] , uh [, I] would [not] [have been] real fulfilled [. I] really would [not] [have been] totally staying home [with] [a] young [child] . 
B|57| M: _She's_ [like] , 10 [years] old . 
A|58| B: [It's a] wonderful , [it's] wonderful [to] be [a] mother [but] , uh [, [I] like] [I like] [the] [way] [I] did [it] . 
B|59| M: _You're_ [a] terrible parent . 
A|60| B: [I] sort of worked half time [. I] [had] very flexible hours [. I] nursed all three of our children until _they were_ at least [a year] [and] [I] , [you] can [do] [that] despite working very easily which is [one] of [the] things [I] preach all [the] time [to] , [to] mothers . 
B|61| M:  
A|62| B: Um , [and] [I think] we choose very , very carefully [the] , um , alternative situations [that] we [had] them [in] . 
B|63| M: What [do] [you] [think] ? 
A|64| B: Some baby-sitting groups , again [, I] [know] [it] sounds [like] [a] rationalization [, [but] I] really [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early on [are] _around_ lots of other children [and] [they] , [they] learn [to] share [. They] learn [not] necessarily [to] be [the] center of attention [but] [that] at [the] same time we [have to] be [sure] [they are] secure . 
B|65| M: Yes , 
A|66| B: [I think] [that] helps . 
B|67| M: Yeah [, but] [what] [if] [they were] [around] , too ? 
A|68| B: [Well [,] so] [, so] . _So ,_ _your wife_ , does she work [right] now ? 
B|69| M: [I'm] [not] . 
A|70| B: [She's] out , 
B|71| M: [So ,] how's [your wife] ? 
A|72| B: [You're] still trying [to] dry out ?
