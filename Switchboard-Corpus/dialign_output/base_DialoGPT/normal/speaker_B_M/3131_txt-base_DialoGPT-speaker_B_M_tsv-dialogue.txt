B|63| M: Why ? 
A|64| B: because [I] [I] think [, what] [do [you] have] there ? _It's_ [a] _house_ , 
B|65| M: [I have] _no_ idea [what] you're talking _about_ .

B|69| M: You [don't have] [to be] [alone] [, we] [can't] [have] [it .] 
A|70| B: _I just_ [don't] understand _why_ [they ,] [so] much _want to_ _just_ _stay in_ [that] building . 
B|71| M: [So _,] why_ [are] [they] [so] hostile ? 
A|72| B: And there's [no] _family_ there [, they] [don't] _get_ [to] see their grandkids [, they] [don't] _get_ [to] see their children [, they] _just_ there [in] [that] _house_ .

A|74| B: [Yeah] . 
B|75| M: [No] . [They're] not . 
A|76| B: _That's_ from [the] child's standpoint . The child [is] _going_ [, why] [don't] [you] _want [to_ be] close [to] me [and] your other [family] . 
B|77| M: [I don't] [really] [care .] [I just] [want to] [know] . 
A|78| B: [What] does [that] [house] got attraction ? 
B|79| M: [I don't] [know] . 
A|80| B: [I] [know] they're [really] proud [of] independence . 
B|81| M: Why [do] [they] hate us ? 
A|82| B: [Uh .] 
B|83| M: Why ? What's [the point] ? 
A|84| B: Well , when [she] got _home_ , who took [care] [of] [her] ? 
B|85| M: I'm not sure if she'll [be] [home] soon . 
A|86| B: [Oh .] 
B|87| M: You can [be] [her] caregiver . 
A|88| B: Uh-huh . 
B|89| M: [I don't] [know] . 
A|90| B: Um 
B|91| M: [It's] not [like] [she's] [going [to] [get] out of] bed [or] anything . 
A|92| B: [Yeah ,] my , husband [and] [I] [, we] [have] been thinking [about] his folks [are] [in] College Station [and] we've [pretty] much planned [that] we'll [be] here [in the] _Dallas_ area [and] there's nothing [to] hold them there [in] College Station since they're retired . 
B|93| M: [That's] nice [, but] I'm not sure if [you] can find [a place] [to] [stay in] [Dallas] 
A|94| B: [So] [we] thought maybe [we] could [get] them [to] move [a] little closer here .
