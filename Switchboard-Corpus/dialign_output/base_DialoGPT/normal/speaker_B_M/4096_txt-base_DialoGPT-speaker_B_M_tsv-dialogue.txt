B|3| M: Uhhh _, uh [, I_ didn't think that] _the_ EPUB [was a] thing yet . 
A|4| B: Right . So , what what _is_ [the _E] P_ A recommending now ? 
B|5| M: [I] don't know . I'm _just_ [a] little confused . 
A|6| B: Uh-huh . 
B|7| M: _The_ [E P] [a] [is] [a] pretty [new] proposal . 
A|8| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: Right . That's [a] , that's [a] common _problem_ though . That _it_ seems , [that] has happened in Dallas as well as New York and [I] try [to] _recycle_ all of [the] newspapers [that] come [to] my house and after [a] while [I] [just] quit taking [the] newspaper because [I] couldn't _recycle_ _it_ anymore which isn't _good_ for business on [the] other end either [, I] suppose . 
B|11| M:  . 
A|12| B: Uh-huh . 
B|13| M: This [is] [it] 
A|14| B: Right . 
B|15| M: [I] don't 
A|16| B: Well , that's _good_ . 
B|17| M: I've had [a] few people have said [that] _they're_ not buying _it ._ 
A|18| B: Right . There has [to] be [, uh ,] [a] reuse for [it _.] I mean_ , that's why _they_ _recycle_ . [The] one [I] [think] [is] [the] most interesting [is] with [the] recycled bottles and all [that] [, uh ,] [the] industry seems [to] be doing with [the] recycled polymers . Uh , everything from [, uh ,] waste baskets [to] carpet [to the] no stick [, _I] mean_ [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
B|19| M:  
A|20| B: and [, uh , I] [think] _they are_ _even_ putting [it] in [the] roadways these days and [they're] making clothes now [that] _are_ recycled . Like [the] recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like _that ._ 
B|21| M: [they are] recy [recycle] 
A|22| B: Uh-huh . 
B|23| M:  ? 
A|24| B: Oh really . 
B|25| M: N 
A|26| B: Right . 
B|27| M: [I] [was] [just] joking 
A|28| B: Huh . 
B|29| M: Solar panels can't [even] do [that .] 
A|30| B: Well , _it's_ _carbon_ so [that] makes sense , like [a] _carbon_ fuel of some sort , but what what about _emissions_ ? 
B|31| M: But ... [carbon] dioxide [emissions] [are] only [a] [problem] if _you_ [are] burning [it .] 
A|32| B: Oh . 
B|33| M: [I] know [that [.] I mean] [it's] [just] paper . 
A|34| B: Okay 
B|35| M: I'll burn [it .] 
A|36| B: No . Well [it's] interesting [. I] bet [that] [was _a] good_ day , at [the] yeah , conference then . 
B|37| M: [Yeah .] She's [a good] cook 
A|38| B: Did [it] change anything for [you] ? 
B|39| M: [I] [was] [just] wondering
