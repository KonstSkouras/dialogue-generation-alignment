A|62| B: [Yeah [, I] like] Moody Blues [. I] [, I like] mostly [the] older groups [I think] . Oh [, but] we _do_ _have_ [, I like] Simply _Red_ , we got Simply _Red_ [. I] figure _all_ our [C] Ds [that] we _have_ _what I_ [really like] And , uh [, I like] Breeze [, I like the] group [. I think] [just] because they _all_ sort [of] [sound] , they [sound] [a lot] [like] uh , Simply _Red_ . Uh . 
B|63| M: [Red] 
A|64| B: [No [,] it's] [, it's] got people singing [, but] [it's] [it] [is] instrumental . _But_ [it's] [, it's] got people singing [but] [it's] got [a] , [like] [a] whole bunch [of] people singing . 
B|65| M: [But _,] and , and_ . 
A|66| B: [You know ,] how many people _are_ [in] Simply [Red] , Stuart [to] someone else [in the] [he] can't hear me [. I] [, I don't] remember how many people [, but] [, it's] [, it's] got men [and] women [and] [it's not] [, it's] [, it's] nice [, I] mean [it's] pleasant , _you know ,_ [music .] [It's] [not] where [it's] , [it] hurts your ears [to] hear [it] . [But] [it's not] as [, [it's] not] [like] , uh , Chicago where [it's] got [that] [much] instrument [to] [it] . [You know ,] [it] doesn't _have_ , [like] _all_ [the] brass [and] everything . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: [Yeah .] 
B|69| M: [I don't] . 
A|70| B: Oh , [you] must live [in] [this] _area_ .

B|81| M: They [don't] [have] any _other_ schools . 
A|82| B: [Yeah ,] _East Texas_ [is] _recruiting_ [for] , _you know ,_ their fall semester 
B|83| M: [East Texas] 
A|84| B: [and] _they're_ , they've [been] doing [a lot [of] that] [in the] [area] . 
B|85| M: [They're] [the] biggest [recruiting] program [in the] state 
A|86| B: [No] more _, huh_ . 
B|87| M: We'll [be] getting [a] few recruits [in the] spring [, but] [they're] [a] little _out_ [of the] loop . 
A|88| B: [Well [,] right] now [I'm just] [a] homemaker [, but] [I'm] [going to] school , uh , [for] legal assistant [and] [that's] _what I_ [know ,] [so] [, and ,] uh , [just] nothing basically 
B|89| M: What [do [you know] [,] huh] ? 
A|90| B: [No ,] no , [it] , no [I don't] go [to] [East Texas] [. I] got [a] degree from T W U [, but] [I'm] [really] interested [in] legal , [you know ,] [in the] legal environment [, but [I] don't] want [to be] [a] lawyer [so] _I said_ well [, [I] think] I'll go back [to] school [and] see [about] being [a] legal assistant . 
B|91| M: [So] ? 
A|92| B: Oh , uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [I] 
A|94| B: [Yeah .] 
B|95| M: Not ahem . 
A|96| B: [Yeah [,] that's] how [it] works . 
B|97| M: [It's] [the] same [with] [all] [of them] _, and [you_ just] [have _to] say_ [the] [names .] 
A|98| B: And [this] [is] [the] man [that] was [in] front [of] [you] ? 
B|99| M:  
A|100| B: Oh , well they'll , weed [him] [out] . 
B|101| M: N 
A|102| B: [Yeah .] 
B|103| M: [That's] [right] . 
A|104| B: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: He'll [be] fine . 
A|106| B: [Well ,] [not] necessarily 
B|107| M: _So ,_ [what] [are] [the] requirements [for] [a] moderator ? 
A|108| B: [but] there's probably something else [that] might make [you .] Because [you] could [know] [about] , [you] could [know] [about] [the] crime [, but] [not] necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury , [you know ,] [not] [be] accepted [for] [the] jury . 
B|109| M: [I] _would_ [like] [to] [know] [that] [too] 
A|110| B: [I] mean , pretty [much] [a lot of] people [would] [know] [about] [it] , [you know [,] and , and] [know] some [of the] different things [about] [it] [but] , uh , they , they might weed [you] [out] some [other] way . [You know ,] [if] [you] , [if] [you] [don't] believe , [like] [if] [this] was [a] capital crime [and [, and] you] [don't] believe [in] [if] [you] [don't] believe [in] death penalty , you're [not] [going to be] picked [at] [all] . [So] [but] , 
B|111| M: [I] 
A|112| B: [Yeah ,] [so] , see , [there] , [there] they [would] [have] [a] doubt [about] [you] , [that] , [you know ,] 
B|113| M: [No] 
A|114| B: because [if] [that's] [what] , [if] [that's] [what] [the] punishment [is] [in] [that] , [in] [that] instance , then you're always [going [to] say] , [you know ,] [not] you're , you're [not] [going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have] [that] uh , [that] punishment . [So ,] 
B|115| M: It 
A|116| B: Uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [That's] [what [I] said] . 
A|118| B: [Well ,] especially [with] something where [you] [have to] [you] [have to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . [You] [have to] find whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like] , [do you] [really] [feel] [that] sure [about] ,
