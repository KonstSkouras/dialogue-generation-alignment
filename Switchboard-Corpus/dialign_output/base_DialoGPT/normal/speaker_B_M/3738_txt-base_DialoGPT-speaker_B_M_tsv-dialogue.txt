B|1| M: I'm ready 
A|2| B: I'll let _you_ _lead_ out . 
B|3| M: _Oh_ . Alright . 
A|4| B: I'll let _you_ _lead_ out . 
B|5| M: _I don't_ _have_ anything _to_ [lead] [you] . 
A|6| B: [I] _think_ one of the things that's interesting [to] me _is_ if [you] look particularly at the political changes _is_ that the , they seem [to] be social , they seem [to] be economically driven also . 
B|7| M: Theylol 
A|8| B: So if [you] look at Russia and what's happened over there , [I] _think_ the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing . And , of course , [I] look at the economic problems in the United States right now . One of the things [you] wonder _is_ _what_ that's going [to] _do_ [to] us . 
B|9| M:  _, yeah_ ? yes 
A|10| B: [I] _think_ the other kind of changes _like_ job changes and those kinds of things , [I] mean , [I] _think_ it's great [to] even [have] three _or_ four different careers in your life . 
B|11| M: What [do] _you're_ [what] 
A|12| B: [I] _think it_ must [have] been terribly boring [to] go through , your life doing just one thing for fifty _years_ _or_ forty _years_ . 
B|13| M: 50 [years] 
A|14| B: Some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that , that aspects changing . 
B|15| M: It's pretty _hard_ [to] _not_ feel [like] you've accomplished something 
A|16| B: And the uncertainty of whether [you're] going [to] [have] a job _is_ [not] as _good_ , but , the fact that [you] really can make major changes in your life and jobs . 
B|17| M: That's true . 
A|18| B: [I] _think_ it's great . 
B|19| M: Do [you] [think it] [is] [good] [or] [not] ? 
A|20| B: [Oh] [, yeah] . 
B|21| M: It's [good] . 
A|22| B: [I] [think] one of the problems with , with education as [it] relates [to] this , though , [is] that [I don't] know that education [is] prepared [to] help people make those changes . It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on [is] gearing people towards a profession and [not] giving them the skills and whatever those skills _are_ necessary [to] make those job changes , which [I] [think] [is] going [to] be a [hard] thing for , for people [to] face . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: Yeah . 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: There probably needs [to] be some training on how [to] , [to] , [to] adjust [to] these changes as they come about . [I] mean if [you] look at the , the high unemployment rate right now and [you] look at people who _are_ in those situations , [I don't] know that they [have] [good] coping skills [or] a lot of them , even ideas of how [to] make those changes now . 
B|27| M:  . 
A|28| B: So [it] seems [to] me that while those changes _are_ taking place _, maybe_ we're [not] well preparing people [to] make the changes with them . 
B|29| M: [I] [have] [, maybe] 
A|30| B: Uh-huh . 
B|31| M: What [are]
