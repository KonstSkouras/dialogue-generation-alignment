A|0| B: _I_ can't _remember_ which . _I_ was on _a_ _jury_ trial last year only _I_ got kicked _out_ as , uh , _the_ last selection _that_ _the_ , uh , defense got . 
B|1| M: _You_ can _get_ [out] _of_ [jury] 
A|2| B: Um . 
B|3| M: Perem's _not_ [that] _bad_ 
A|4| B: That , uh , 
B|5| M: _I don't_ [remember] . 
A|6| B: Right , but it still has _to_ _be_ _a _group_ of_ your _peers ._ 
B|7| M: _But_ _it's_ _not_ [a group] , _it's [a_ group] . 
A|8| B: See . 
B|9| M: _I think_ _you_ mean [the] [group of] [peers .] 
A|10| B: So , if [it's] your [peers] and you're [not] educated then , 
B|11| M: _I'm_ _in the_ _process_ [of] getting my education . 
A|12| B: [You] _want_ [you] _want_ [a] nincompoop [jury] because they'll sympathize _with_ [you] [a] bit as well as hopefully being honest people and _do_ their best _to_ comply _with_ [the] facts as they were presented _to_ them . 
B|13| M: _I don't _know_ what_ [I] [want] _to do with_ my life . 
A|14| B: So , _that's_ why [the] defense is there picking through them , whereas at [the] same time , [the] , uh , [the] prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him , uh , [a] _guilty_ verdict if [the] facts warrant . 
B|15| M: Yes 
A|16| B: So , uh , [I _think] the_ [jury] selection [process] is pretty neat , but [I don't] [think] [that] [the] [jury] ought [to] _be_ [the] ones picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
B|17| M: Pick ? 
A|18| B: [I think] [that] _should be_ left up [to] people who have some knowledge [in the] subject and more knowledge than [a] [jury] would have . you're talking about , [the] person's already been found _guilty_ , _right_ 
B|19| M:  ... [guilty] . 
A|20| B: and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V , [the] [jury] will make [a] recommendation as [to] leniency or as [to] [the] death penalty or whatever , but [I think] [that] it _should be_ up [to] [the] judge and [the] , uh , lawyers [to] make [the] decision as [to] [what] [the] actual penalty will _be ._ 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: Maybe just [the] judge because they're [the] people who [know what] [the] system is and [what] [it's] all about and believe [in the] system . 
B|23| M: [I] agree . 
A|24| B: Uh , and [I think] [that] would provide [a] more fair sentencing procedure . As opposed [to] an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may _be_ [a] more consistent sentencing procedure . 
B|25| M: Uhhuh 
A|26| B: Well , preceding criminal record , according [to] [the] judicial [process] has nothing [to do with] [the] current crime . [But] when it comes [to] , uh , sentencing for punishment , [of] course , if [the] person's never done anything [bad] before , according [to] [the] judicial system , then they're _going_ [to] lean towards [a] slightly more lenient side , and [the] jury's supposed [to] _be_ notified [of] criminal records when it comes [to] sentencing by [jury] . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: At least [in] California , they're supposed [to] _be ._ Not during [the] trial , during [the] trial as [to] whether they're [guilty] or [not] has nothing [to do with] their background . 
B|29| M:  
A|30| B: [But] when it comes [to] [what] kind [of] sentence you're _going_ [to] lay down , [I think] [that] , uh , [that] they _should_ . 
B|31| M: _I'm_ [going] ? 
A|32| B: [I don't] , [I don't know] [that] they always have because [I] never sat all [the] way through [a] [jury] trial . _They_ [get] too boring . 
B|33| M: [You] [know] [that's] [a] lie [right] ? 
A|34| B: Well , if [it's a] second offense , [the] punishment _should_ certainly _be_ more severe than [a] first offense , because obviously , [the] rehabilitation [process] did [not] work [the] first time . 
B|35| M: [You] 
A|36| B: So [you] got [to] give them either more time [in the] system or [a] different [process] [that] will hopefully work better . When it comes down [to] things like alternative sentencing , [I'm] all for [that] for , uh , small crimes , infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets [that] have gone [to] warrant , [you] give them [the] option [of] working off their time doing civil service sort [of] things . 
B|37| M: It 
A|38| B: [I think] those ought [to] _be_ punished [a] whole lot worse than they are . 
B|39| M: [They] [should [be] .] 
A|40| B: Yeah . 
B|41| M: Do [you] [think the] police [should] 
A|42| B: Well , uh , say , embezzlement , [right] . [You] [get] [a] guy down [the] street who comes up , uh , carrying [a]
