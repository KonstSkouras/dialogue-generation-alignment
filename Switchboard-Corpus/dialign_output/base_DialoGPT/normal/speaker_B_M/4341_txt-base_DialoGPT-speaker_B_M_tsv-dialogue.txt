A|0| B: _I mean_ _I mean _,_ I'm_ thinking of an extreme case _like_ _a_ serial _murderer_ 
B|1| M: _You_ _have_ _to_ _be_ [a] [murderer] _to_ _have_ [a] choice . 
A|2| B: or , 
B|3| M: Uhh , it's not illegal . 
A|4| B: Well , for some things . 
B|5| M: You're not _in_ [a] position _to_ make decisions _about_ _it ,_ you're _a person_ . 
A|6| B: _I think_ for serial murder _it is_ warranted because _if_ [a person] who _would_ _do something_ _like_ _that_ [in] cold blood , 
B|7| M: [I mean ,] it's not [like] anyone [is] _going to_ [do something] _about_ [it] . 
A|8| B: [I mean ,] _you_ _can't_ guarantee _that they_ wouldn't escape from prison and _do it_ again . 
B|9| M: _You_ [can't] say [that] _about_ [a] [murderer] . 
A|10| B: And _I don't_ _think_ _that ,_ [that] rehabilitation [is] effective . 
B|11| M: Because he did [it] . 
A|12| B: But , then , _you_ know , _I think_ _that ,_ [that] some murderers _don't_ really warrant capital punishment . [You] know , just , [like] , for example , uh , _you_ know , _you_ hear [about] cases where women [have] killed their husbands who abused them 
B|13| M:  
A|14| B: and _I don't_ _think_ , [that] _would_ really warrant capital punishment . 
B|15| M:  ... 
A|16| B: Uh _it is_ [to] [a] certain extent 
B|17| M: You're 
A|18| B: _but_ _I think_ , _I don't_ know because , 
B|19| M: [I think] you've got _the_ wrong impression . 
A|20| B: [I think] [in] and [it ,] just _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances and , and [the] extent of [the] abuse and , and _if_ another alternative was available . 
B|21| M: If [they] were not [in] jail , how did [they] [do it] ? 
A|22| B: Well , [I think] [that] _would_ [be] kind of drastic punishment . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: And , 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: But , one thing , [I think] [that] _if_ there [is] [a] chance for rehabilitation then [that] chance should [be] investigated . 
B|27| M: [I'm] not saying it's impossible . [I'm] saying [it is] . 
A|28| B: But , [like] [I] said , _if_ , _if_ someone [is] , [is] just pathologically [going to] murder people no matter what then [I think] [they] should [be] eliminated from society . 
B|29| M: [I'm] not sure [if] [you] _are_ saying [that ,] [but] it's not [that] [I don't] want [to] [be] murdered [, I'm] saying [I] [would] rather [be] rehabilitated . 
A|30| B: But , 
B|31| M: [I] agree with [you] . [I'm] not saying [that they] _are a danger_ . 
A|32| B: And [a] lot of people [that] [are a danger] [to] society [that] aren't [in] prison . 
B|33| M: U 
A|34| B: Well , [I] know [in] North Carolina , we [do] [have] capital punishment . 
B|35| M:  
A|36| B: And [I'm] [I'm] from South Carolina .
