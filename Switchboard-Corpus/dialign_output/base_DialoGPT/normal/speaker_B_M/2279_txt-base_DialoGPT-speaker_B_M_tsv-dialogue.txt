A|17| B: _so_ . 
B|18| M: [Oh] _. So ._ 
A|19| B: _Yeah , and_ _how_ about , _how_ about [like] [on the] weekends . [Do _you] do_ sports _or_ _do you_ _go_ out ?

A|23| B: In [the] _summer_ _or_ [like] [in the] Easter _time_ , [like] _around_ [now] ? 
B|24| M: [What] [time] [do [you] do] _your_ [summer] vacation ? 
A|25| B: And where [do you] _go_ ? 
B|26| M: _You_ _can_ _go to the beach ,_ _go to a_ _beach [,_ or] _go _to_ school_

B|28| M: Where [do you] _live_ ? 
A|29| B: [Oh] , okay , well , first , [they] always [say] , _get_ [to] [know] [your] country first before [you] _leave_ [, I] _mean_ _I [,_ I] lived [in] places , [like] 
B|30| M: [I] _live_ [in the] US 
A|31| B: when [I] lived [in] Washington _, uh ,_ Washington , D C [, I] _never_ _went [to_ the] Washington Memorial _, and_ then when _I went_ _back to_ visit _, I went [to_ the] Washington Memorial . 
B|32| M: What's [the] difference ? 
A|33| B: Right . 
B|34| M: They're , they're 
A|35| B: Right . _Well _,_ it's_ _, it's_ [a] beautiful city . 
B|36| M: Why ? 
A|37| B: _But [,_ the] problem [is] , [like] first [time] _I went_ out [of] [here] _, and_ [they] took me [to] _Las Vegas_ 
B|38| M: [Well _,] you can_ _go to the_ museum [and] [have a] look [around] . 
A|39| B: [and] _that_ _was_ [the] most boring place [on] earth . 
B|40| M: _I'm from_ [Las Vegas] . 
A|41| B: _Yeah_ . Did _, uh ,_ _did_ , [like ,] _did you_ [go _to] Disneyland_ ? 
B|42| M: _I know_ ! _I've been_ [to Disneyland] ! 
A|43| B: [Oh] , okay [. So] [, but] um , [now] _, I _don't_ know [,_ but] um [, but] let's see , when _I was_ eleven _I went_ also [to the] Caribbean . 
B|44| M: _I know _,_ I'm_ [a] _girl_ [, and] yes [, I went to] Disney World . 
A|45| B: _and _,_ uh ,_ then after _that_ [, _I] _,_ my_ sister lives _in Turkey_ _, so_ when _I was_ [like] fourteen , fifteen [, I went] [, I went to] _Turkey ._ 
B|46| M: _I [go_ _to] school_ [in [Turkey] .] 
A|47| B: And [this] Christmas [, I went to] [Turkey .] _But_ basically _, it's_ [a] , [for] [the] past couple [of] years [, _I] ,_ since _my_ parents _are_ , _are_ , well [, [I'm] from] _Argentina_ _, and my_ parents [live] down there [. So] , all [the] traveling [I do] [is] alone . 
B|48| M: [Yeah ,] _I'll_ [leave] 
A|49| B: And _, uh , we_ were _never_ _much_ [of] _, uh ,_ [a] very _, uh ,_ _family_ thing _, you know ,_ made , [like] [go] skiing [in] Vermont [or] something . 
B|50| M:  ... 
A|51| B: That _was_ _, uh ,_ _that_ _was_ _a lot_ [of] fun . 
B|52| M: [I'm] sure [, it's] [been] [a] [long] [time] . 
A|53| B: _But ,_ what happens [is] _we_ used [to] fight _a lot_ _, so_ there's _never_ _much_ [of] _a family_ _family_ thing . [You] [know ,] _one_ [of] those hell _family_ vacations . 
B|54| M: _I think_ [you] [mean] [family] . 
A|55| B: [Yeah] . 
B|56| M: [You] _try to_ _make_ _it [,_ we] _try_ . 
A|57| B: [Yeah] . 
B|58| M: Because [, uh , we] _try_ [, my] mom [is] dead _, you know _, my_ dad_ [was] dead [, and my] mom's dead [, I'm] [a] _dad [,_ you] [mean] . 
A|59| B: [Well [,] my [dad] ,] all _he ,_ all _he_ wanted _to do_ [was] _get_ _money_ [for] [us] _, so_ _he_ _could_ buy [us] material things . 
B|60| M: [So] why [did _you] have kids_ ? 
A|61| B: And [, and] [to] me [, you know [,] it's] [like ,] [now] [I'm] twenty-two [, but] [I] still feel [, you know [,] it's] [like] _yeah_ _, we never_ threw _a football_ [or] something 
B|62| M: _Yeah , and [,_ we never] throw [a football] [, but] [we] throw . 
A|63| B: [and] [the] way _I was_ brought up [, and] _he_ wants me [now] _, he ,_ [like] _he [,_ you know ,] [like] _he_ wants _to be_ _best_ friends [now] 
B|64| M: [I was] raised by [a] woman _, and _I_ know_ [how] 
A|65| B: [and] [it's] very hard [for] me because [, you know [,] it's] [like] [you] grow up _to be_ twenty years [old] [, and] [it's] always [the same] man 
B|66| M: [I [,] uh ,] [don't _know [,] I_ don't] _think_ 
A|67| B: [and] then suddenly _he_ sees _that_ _he's_ getting [old] [, and] _he_ wants _to be_ _best_ friends 
B|68| M: _He_ has [a] friend who [is] [like ,] 25 [and] [he's] [the] [best] friend [he's] _ever_ _had_ . 
A|69| B: [but] [, uh [,] you know [,] it's] [like , I] [can] _only_ express myself _so_ _much_ , because [, you know ,] um , everything _that_ _he_ taught me [, you know ,] _that_ [my] [family] taught me , which [is] very hard [to] change _that_ all [of] [a] sudden [from] _one_ year [to the] next [and] [say] [, I'm] sorry [, you know] . [It's] [like [,] you [know ,] I] love [you] [and] let's [go] out [and] [do] things together when [I don't] feel [like] [it [,] you know] 
B|70| M: [I] 
A|71| B: [and] _so_ , that's _that_ whole thing _that_ he'll [say] when , [like ,] [like] [I've] seen [my] uncle [and] his [family] [, you know ,] _does_ everything together [, and] [you know ,] his [kids] _are_ [, you know ,] when his [little] [girl] [was] five years [old] [and] everything , [they] [, uh ,] [they] would [go to the beach [,] and] she _could_ [go to] sleep at two [in the] morning [you know] 
B|72| M: [you] . 
A|73| B: [and [,] uh [,] [I] was] brought up [the same] way , [it] doesn't matter what age [you have] , [just] _so_ [long] as [you can] _get_ up _to go to_ class [the] next morning [, you can] _stay_ up [you know ,] 
B|74| M: _It_ 
A|75| B: [but] his , what _he does_ [is] , when _he_ gets _home_ _, he_ separates his work [from] his house . 
B|76| M: [But [,] [he] does] , [he's] [, he] stays , [stay] [, he ,] he' [he ,] stay' [stay] , [stay] 
A|77| B: [Yeah] . 
B|78| M: [you _have] [to_ be] [in] [school] [to do] [that] . 
A|79| B: [Yeah] . 
B|80| M: [You] [have [a] family] ? 
A|81| B: [Yeah ,] _yeah_ [, but] [, uh [,] it's] [just] [, it's] [just] something [that] [, you know , my] theory [is] [, you know ,] when , when [you have kids] [and] all _you [,_ you] _want [to_ [do] ,] well , what [I'll] [do] [is] [, you know ,] [like , I] [mean] [, you] might [have] problems [, but] [it's] [not] [your] kids' problems [you know ,] 
B|82| M:  
A|83| B: [and] [you] got [to] [try [to] be] with them as _much_ as [you can] [and] [to] [, you know ,] [like ,] thing [is] , [is] , [that] [, you know ,] [like] _if_ , _if_ [they] would [ever] happen [to] [have a] drug problem , suppose , [that] [they] _could_ feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] saying [, I] got [a] problem [you know ,] 
B|84| M:  
A|85| B: [and [,] uh] [and] [that] would [make] _any_ parent feel _good_ [and] bad at [the same] [time] [, you know ,] 
B|86| M: [You] 
A|87| B: first [of] all _you're_ coming [to] me [and] let's see [how] [we] [can] _get_ rid [of the] problem [, you know [,] and] that's [uh ,] that's very , that's very hard [to [do] ,] because once _you're_ [best] friends with [your] parents , then [, [I] think] everything [go] _a lot_ better . 
B|88| M:  
A|89| B: [Yeah] . 
B|90| M: Yes [, I'm] [, it's] . 
A|91| B: [Yeah [,] my] [, my] father [was] raising four oh well , three [kids] before [he] [had] me _, so_ [it] [was] [, uh [,] you know _,] you're_ _trying_ , [to] support [, uh ,] four [kids] [, and] [it's] _pretty_ hard [you know ,] 
B|92| M: [I [,] [you] ,] 
A|93| B: [and [I] [,] I] _told_ him , listen [you] _could have_ [had] _a lot_ [of] _money_ _if_ [you] would [have] _only_ [had] two [kids] . 
B|94| M: [I _don't] have any money_ . 
A|95| B: [He] says _yeah_ [, but] then [I] wouldn't [have] [you [,] [I] go] , _yeah_ [, but] then [you] would [have _a] lot_ [of] [money] 
B|96| M: [I'm] [not] sure [if] [I] should [say] yes [, but] [yeah] 
A|97| B: [Yeah] . 
B|98| M: [But] [I was] [told] [that] [I] [could [have] a] [much] bigger [family] [. I] . [could have] [been] [a lot] richer . Thats why _I [have_ [a] family] _. It_ isnt really [my] fault 
A|99| B: [But [,] you know ,] [like ,] four [, I] [mean] four children [is] expensive , especially when [you] consider [like ,] especially [for] me , which _I'm paying_ out [of] state tuition . _I'm paying_ [, you know ,] three thousand , no , what [is] [it ,] two thousand six hundred dollars [for] _one_ semester . 
B|100| M: [I'm paying] . 
A|101| B: And [, you know ,] people [say] [, you know [,] it's] expensive [to] [think] [it's] college [, but] , [if] , [if] everybody would [be] [a little] bit responsible [, you know [,] it's] [like ,] what [does] [it ,] what [does] [it] cost [. It] costs five hundred dollars [a] semester suppose . Now [they] [go to a] state college [and] [they] [live] at _home_ [you know ,] 
B|102| M: _No_ 
A|103| B: [and] well , [it] costs two hundred dollars [for] books [, but] [you know ,] seven hundred dollars [a] semester , [a lot] [of] people [can] spare [that] [if] [they] planned ahead [, you know ,] [like] 
B|104| M:  ... 
A|105| B: [I] [mean] [, it's] [like ,] [if] [you] plan [a] year ahead [, you can] probably save up seven hundred dollars [you know ,] _one_ thousand four hundred dollars [to] send [your] child [to] college [, you know] . 
B|106| M: [Yeah ,] 
A|107| B: [Oh] , oh , excuse me ? 
B|108| M: [I'm] [not] [a] _student_ . 
A|109| B: [Well [,] [I] [,] I'm] _doing_ computer science , computer _engineering_ . 
B|110| M: [What] kind [of] [engineering] [are you doing ?] 
A|111| B: [Yeah , and [,] and] [now] [I'm] looking [for a] job before [they] [have to] send me _back home_ 
B|112| M: [I'm] [trying] [to] [get] [back home] . 
A|113| B: because since [I'm] [an] international [student] , [they] _want to_ send me _back _to_ Argentina_ . 
B|114| M: Why [not] ? 
A|115| B: [Well [,] my dad] wants me _to go back [._ So .] 
B|116| M: Yes [, [you] do] . 
A|117| B: [No] . 
B|118| M: [I] [want [to] go [to] Argentina] 
A|119| B: [No] , because [if] [you] _go back_ there , then [you can] [never] [get] out . 
B|120| M: [I'm] going [back [to] the] future . 
A|121| B: Like [you] [don't have any money] [to] , [to] , [get] out . 
B|122| M: [I don't] . 
A|123| B: [So] [, uh [,] and [,] uh [,] [I] was] thinking [, you know ,] [like ,] [Oh] [my] God [, you [know ,] [I] _go] back_ there [, and] then [, and I] [get] _married_ there [, and] [now] [I [have] kids] there [, and] then [I'll] [never] [leave] [the] place [, you know] . 
B|124| M: [But] [you're] [married] [, so] [you] don'have [to go back .] 
A|125| B: [Yeah [,] [I know] [,] and] that's , that's what happened [to] [my] brother . [He] came [to school] up [here] [, and] then when [he] [went] down there [, he] [was] [just] [so] bad off [, you know] [from] [not] being able [to] [stay] up [here] [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
B|126| M:  ... 
A|127| B: [So .] 
B|128| M: That's [how] [you] [get] . 
A|129| B: [Yeah ,] [I've been] calling [a lot] [of] companies . There , some [of] them [are] interested . [Well ,] at least [for a] year [and] [a] half [I] [can] work , 
B|130| M: [Well [,] you're] [not] [the] [only] [one] . 
A|131| B: [so] . 
B|132| M: [It's] [been] [pretty] [good] . 
A|133| B: All _right_ , [same] [here] . 
B|134| M: You're [right] . 
A|135| B: Bye-bye .
