B|57| M: Um [, uh _,] I don't_ think [so] . 
A|58| A: _you_ all equated [the] family reunions as , with [the] Protestant . 
B|59| M: They [are] . 
A|60| A: _It was_ [the] Protestant _version [of_ the] Catholic pilgrimage . 
B|61| M: [that's] [the] catholic [version of] _it_ [, not] [the] catholian [version] . 
A|62| A: _It was_ , _it was_ an interesting theory . She talked about [the] [, uh ,] [the] Catholics all [, it's a] [home] centered , _you_ [know [,] it's] all family centered anyway , [so] _you_ usually [are] living where [your] parents live [and] [it's] all [, your] , _you_ [don't] [have] [to] come [home] , [so] [the] Catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older Europe , but when [the] Protestant ethic happened [in] America , there [were] people [who] [ever] went out [and ,] _you_ [know ,] went away from [the] family [to] seek their fortune _, and_ then had [to] come back [home] [for] their _reunion ,_ [so] [that] , became their [version [of] the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| A: [But] she had , _it was_ interesting , _you_ [know [, [I] don't] know] how valid [it] [is] , but she talked about [that] [and] how [the] , [the] big picnic table [was] [the] symbolic communion [of the] people gathering together _, [and_ ,] um , _you_ [know ,] about [the] [bread] [and] [the] ritual placement . Do _you_ [have a] , [a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed out on [the] table [every] , [every] year ? Is there kind [of] [a] , _you_ [know ,] salads go _first_ [and] things [like that] ? 
B|65| M:  
A|66| A: _Right_ . 
B|67| M: h . 
A|68| A: [Well [,] that's] pretty .

A|80| A: _Right_ . 
B|81| M: What's [the] worst ? 
A|82| A: _Right_ 
B|83| M: No . [It was] [a] joke . 
A|84| A: Have [you] , [have] [you] done [this] repetitively , [or] [just] once ? 
B|85| M: [Right] [, and] 
A|86| A: [Oh .] 
B|87| M: [I] think [it was] 
A|88| A: See [, that's] we've [we] had [a] problem with [that] . 
B|89| M: _We_ 
A|90| A: [Oh .] 
B|91| M: He died [in _the] second_ half [of _the] first_ season . 
A|92| A: [Right] . That's our , [was] our problem . [We] had [, uh ,] [the first] _reunion ,_ [or] [the first] , [you] [know ,] major _reunion_ [was] probably six [or] seven [years] ago . 
B|93| M: [I] [, uh ,] [what] ? 
A|94| A: And then [the _second] reunion ,_ people [who] maybe , [you] [know ,] had sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first] [one] thought , oh , [well] [, it's] [not] [that] big _a thing_ [this] year , 
B|95| M: The [second reunion [,] uh ,] [what] ? 
A|96| A: [and] [so] [it] kind [of] wound down , 
B|97| M: [But] [it's] still [not] [a thing] , right ? 
A|98| A: [and] then finally , [you] _know , you're_ lucky [to] get , [you] [know ,] [you] get [the] Shreveport relatives there , but no [one] else [so] [that] , 
B|99| M: You [know , you're] [not] wrong .
