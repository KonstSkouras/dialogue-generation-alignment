B|2| M: It's _not_ _that_ hard . _They just don't_ _have the_ power _to do it ._ 
A|3| A: _Yeah ,_ what's amazing is some _of_ them [have] been on [death] row for _a_ number _of_ years . 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: And _, uh ,_ here _in_ Maryland _I_ _know_ _we_ [have] _a_ _real_ problem _with_ overcrowding _in_ prisons _, uh _,_ just ,_ 
B|6| M: _that_ . 
A|7| A: _Yeah ,_ but _I_ mean , _in_ , here it's _, uh ,_ [to] [the] point where _they were_ letting prisoners go . Uh , commuting [the] sentences _of_ those [that] _were_ _in_ , _in jail_ for lesser _crimes_ , _in_ order [to] put more _people_ _in_ , into [the] jails . 
B|8| M: _You_ _don't_ _have _to_ be a_ criminal _to be_ [in jail] . 
A|9| A: And [it] _was_ _just _,_ uh ,_ amazing _to me_ _, and_ _of_ course _they_ made [a] big deal _out_ _of the_ , [the] few [that] got _out_ _and_ turned around _and_ committed [a] crime within five days _of_ getting _out_ _, and_ being rearrested an . 
B|10| M: _They_

B|16| M: Yes , 
A|17| A: _I don't_ _see_ someone [not] going _out_ there _and_ _committing_ murder because _they're_ afraid _they're_ going [to] get sentenced [to] [death] . _I_ mean , most _people_ _out_ there _committing_ murders [don't] _care ._ 
B|18| M: Murdering 
A|19| A: [They just don't] _care ._ 
B|20| M: How _do_ [they] justify _this_ ? 
A|21| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|22| M: [They] [don't] really [care .] [They just] punish [the] [people] _who_ _commit_ [crimes] . [They] [don't] _even_ [care] _about_ [the] [people] [committing] [crimes] . 
A|23| A: _Yeah ,_ yeah _, and_ there's _, uh ,_ there's [a] lot _of_ [people] here [in] Baltimore [that] _, uh ,_ [have] _and_ _we_ [just] had _, uh ,_ [a] [real] big cocaine bust _, and_ _of_ course , you _know _,_ they're _,_ they're_ playing [it] _up_ [real] big [that] [it] _was ,_ looked like [it] _was_ [a] very , very small ring _and_ [they] [just] [happened] [to] get lucky _and_ catch [the] _guy_ . 
B|24| M: [I] 
A|25| A: But _, I_ mean _, uh ,_ Baltimore has _, uh ,_ an all _time_ record for [the] number _of_ deaths so far [this] year . [I] _think_ they've got over [a] hundred dead already [this] year . 
B|26| M: I'a . 
A|27| A: Well , it's kind _of_ , it's kind _of_ moved _up_ _and_ you [have to] remember [that] [it] , [it] , [it] _, uh ,_ there's _, I_ _think_ , X number _of_ [people] _out_ there [that] _are_ going [to] [commit] murders , 
B|28| M: We , 
A|29| A: _and _,_ uh ,_ once you kill off [a] few _of_ them 
B|30| M: You'll [see] , I'll [commit] [, I] 
A|31| A: [I] mean _if_ you murder [a] _guy_ because _he_ murdered your partner _or_ something like [that] [, I] mean pretty soon you run _out_ _of_ [people] [to] murder . 
B|32| M: What's wrong [with] [that] ? 
A|33| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|34| M: [then] 
A|35| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|36| M:  
A|37| A: _Yeah ,_ you _know ,_ [it] makes sense , um , you _know ,_ you [have the] occasional person [who] may [have] been falsely accused , but [I] mean _, uh ,_ so few _and_ far between _, uh ,_ you _know ,_ makes good T V movies _and_ [that's] [about] [it .] 
B|38| M: ' 
A|39| A: _Yeah_ .

A|41| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|42| M: It's . [about] . [a] . [about] . ''s . 
A|43| A: _Yeah [,_ I] had , my _, uh ,_ my father-in-law participated [in] [a] _, uh ,_ [a] jury trial , _he was ,_ _he was_ actually on [the] jury , 
B|44| M: I'm [not] sure _what_ _you're_ _trying to_ say . 
A|45| A: _and _,_ uh ,_ [this] man _was_ accused _of_ killing _, uh , I_ _think_ [it] _was_ two [people] _, uh _,_ and_ shooting [a] _, uh ,_ policeman , um , point blank [in] [the] face . Of course _he_ didn't die . 
B|46| M: I'm [not] gonna lie . 
A|47| A: And _, uh ,_ [this] _was_ during [a] holdup _of_ [a] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ [a] restaurant _and_ [it] came _out_ during [the] trial [that] , um _, they_ had tried [to] rob another place _and _,_ uh ,_ when [the] _guy_ came _out_ [with] [the] bag [they] thought _was_ money , [it] turned _out_ [to be a] couple cookies _, and _,_ uh ,_ you _know ,_ jumbo cookies _and , and_ so _they were_ so upset from robbing [this] _guy_ , you _know ,_ [trying [to] do] [this] holdup [that] didn't work [that] [they] quite literally _were_ mad _and_ went into [a] restaurant [to] hold [the] place _up_ _and_ [just] started , you _know ,_ shooting [people] . 
B|48| M:

B|50| M: [They] 
A|51| A: _Yeah_ . _Yeah _,_ and_ get [even] [with] [who] [, I] mean , 
B|52| M: [Yeah [,] they're ,] i [don't] [, they] [are] , we're , [we] [, just [,] [they] _were] ,_ [we] [are] [, [and ,] and] [they're] . 
A|53| A: you _know ,_ stupid guys And _, uh ,_ [it] turned _out_ [that] [the] , you _know ,_ policeman survived [to] [the] point _that _he_ was_ able [to] , you _know ,_ identify [the] _guy_ . 
B|54| M: _I [,_ uh _, I] don't know ._ 
A|55| A: And _of_ course , you _know [,_ they] tried [to] make [the] cop look like _he was [,_ uh ,] [a] [, uh ,] no good rotten drunk . 
B|56| M: _He_ _said_ [he was [,] and] _I don't [know_ [,] [that] he] wasn't . 
A|57| A: [I] mean [it] [was] amazing . 
B|58| M: It [was] 
A|59| A: Oh , [he _was] found_ guilty , yeah . 
B|60| M: _He_ [was found] innocent . 
A|61| A: _He [,_ uh ,] um , last [I] heard , [he] [, uh ,] [he] beat [a] push for [the death] penalty . Now whether [they] finally got [it] _or not_ [, I don't know .] 
B|62| M: I'm [just] [trying to] figure [out] [if] [the] _other_ [guy] [was] [the] one [who] [was] beaten [up] [or not] . 
A|63| A: [I] kind _of_ [, uh ,] stopped listening after [a] while . 
B|64| M: How [was] [the] whole thing ? 
A|65| A: Um , you [know ,] [he] would _come home_ [and [, and] ,] you [know ,] after [the] trial [was] over [he] came _home_ [and] told us [what] [was] going on [and] _of_ course [then] [they] had [to] go back [to] you [know ,] after [he] had [to] go , 
B|66| M: [I don't] [think] he'd ever [come home] [to me] 
A|67| A: Right . And [, uh ,] yeah everybody , everybody [was] pretty much , you [know ,] let's burn him . 
B|68| M: It's [just] [the] guilt [of the] [time] . 
A|69| A: And [that's] , you [know [,] that's] [the] way [they] wanted [to do it .] And [he was] surprised because [he] thought there [was] going [to be a] problem because [he] [, uh ,] you [know] some [people] on [the] case [were ,] [were] [a] little hesitant on convicting him on some [of the] charges but [I] mean when [it] all came down [, they] [just ,] within an hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|70| M: What . 
A|71| A: [Yeah] . 
B|72| M:  ... 
A|73| A: [Yeah ,] yeah , well , [it] , [it] , [it] went pretty , pretty quick from [what] [he] [said] . 
B|74| M:  
A|75| A: But [I] mean there's , there's , there's [a] lot [of] [other] [crimes] [out] there [, I] mean besides murder [, I] [think] [, uh ,] now [if] [you're] dealing drugs now , caught more than twice [or] something [, uh ,] [it] , there's [, uh ,] [a] [death] penalty associated [with] [it .] 
B|76| M: No . 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . 
B|78| M:  . 
A|79| A: [Yeah ,] yeah [, I] agree . 
B|80| M:  
A|81| A: [Yeah [,] I] agree [, [I] ,] I've [, I] [have] [, uh ,] [a] low tolerance for [that] kind [of] [, uh [,] that] kind [of] person . And [, uh ,] as far as [, uh ,] you [know] there [are] some , some [other] [crimes] [that] [I] [think] [, uh ,] you [know [,] uh ,] kidnapping , um , you [know ,] when [they] [, I] mean kidnapping per se has [a] certain [, uh [,] uh ,] fine [and] penalty associated [with] [it] , 
B|82| M: [He ,] 
A|83| A: but , um , some [of] these [people] [are] [just] [out] [and] [out] brutal . [I ,] some [of the] cases I've heard [about] over [the] years ,
