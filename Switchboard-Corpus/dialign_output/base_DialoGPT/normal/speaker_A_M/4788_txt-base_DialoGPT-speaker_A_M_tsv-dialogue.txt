B|4| M: I'm _a little_ confused , [are] _you_ saying _that_ [there's] [a] lake , _or_ _that_ _there_ [are] no lakes [in the] south ? 
A|5| A: And we just _have_ this , uh , really good time [there] .

B|6| M: [Well ,] 
A|7| A: _We_ found this one area [that] doesn't _have_ mosquitoes . They just don't _have_ them and it's just wonderful not _to_ _be_ bugged all night long with [a] humming mosquito at your ear , 
B|8| M: [We] [have] mosquit . 
A|9| A: Uh-huh . Sure . 
B|10| M: How 
A|11| A: Sure . Uh-huh . Sure . 
B|12| M:  ... 
A|13| A: Yeah , yeah . 
B|14| M: You [know _,] I_ think I've heard [of a] guy ... 
A|15| A: That was really called roughing it , yeah . [I] , Anymore . Yeah , see 
B|16| M: You'd [be] hard pressed [to] _find_ [a] _, a_ , _or_ [a] 
A|17| A: Uh-huh . Sure . Uh-huh . 
B|18| M: Yup . Uh _, I_ think [so] 
A|19| A: Than [you] , sure . Than it , when [you] were younger , uh-huh . 
B|20| M: Uh , yea . 
A|21| A: it , with kids they don't care if they take [a] shower everyday . With kids they don't care , [you] [know ,] uh [, a] about [a] lot [of] things . But as adults , uh , it's like if [I] don't take [a] shower every day [, I] feel like , [you] [know ,] ooh . 
B|22| M: No ... 
A|23| A: [I] [, I] just don't feel right [so] . There's lots [of] places if you're going [to] go camping . K O A [are] wonderful . It's kind [of] it's kind [of] [the] , uh , yuppie type [of] camping because they [have] showers , they [have] things for kids [to] do . They [have] swimming pools , things like [that] . If [you] can [find] , uh , some really nice , clean , uh , campgrounds versus , uh , if [you] go [to] state parks , uh , 
B|24| M: u 
A|25| A: we [have] found state parks , not [that] they're lacking but , uh , they're certainly not up [to] [a] standard [of a] K O A where it's , [you] [know [,] [a] little] bit cleaner . You've got [the] showers available . It's not , [you] [know ,] [in the] same category . State parks , [you] [know ,] [you] get [a little] bit fearful too , uh , [you] [know ,] things like [that] simply because it , they [are] supposed [to] [be] patrolled but , uh , [you] [know ,] it's , it's [a little] bit different . But , [so] we've always kind [of] stayed with [a] K O A and then , uh , did other things besides just sit at [the] campground at night . That's [the] only time [you] really use your campground . If you're going [to] [be] gone all day long , walking someplace [or] doing tourism [or] whatever uh , you're camping really is just for like [in the] evening [to] start [the] fire , [to] sit back and watch [a] fire , uh , [to] enjoy [that] , [you] [know ,] and then [to] get up [in the] morning and get [a] shower and get cleaned up , [that] kind [of] stuff . 
B|26| M:  
A|27| A: [So] we never really spent [that] much time at [the] campground as much as we did ,
