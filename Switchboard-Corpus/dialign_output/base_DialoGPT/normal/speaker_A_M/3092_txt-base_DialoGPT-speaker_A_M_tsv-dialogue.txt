A|59| A: Okay . 
B|60| M: Eye Care . 
A|61| A: _Vision , I_ guess [it's] called , vision [care .] 
B|62| M: [Vision [, I] think] [it's] [a] great idea . 
A|63| A: It depends _on_ _who_ examines [your] eyes . 
B|64| M: [How] [would] [it] [work] ? 
A|65| A: [If] [you have] _an_ , _an_ optometrist _or_ _an_ ophthalmologist , there's [a] vast _difference_ [in] [those] two [, uh ,] professionals . 
B|66| M: [I'm] [not] sure [if] [I'm] [a] little bit biased [or] _not [,_ but] [I] don't [see] [any] [difference] . 
A|67| A: Glaucoma . 
B|68| M: What [is] glaucomas ? 
A|69| A: Oh . Oh , okay , _so_ , 
B|70| M: [I'm] sure [she] does [, she] [has] [it] 
A|71| A: Yes . 
B|72| M: Are [they] changing ? 
A|73| A: Uh-huh . Yes , [they are] . 
B|74| M: [They are] ... [but] [are] [they] ? 
A|75| A: Uh-huh . 
B|76| M: [And] [the] insurance [is] [on] [her] . 
A|77| A: Right [, that's] critical , because _she's_ [in] need [of] _it so_ often . 
B|78| M: [Yeah] [, [she] is] . She [is] [a] doctor . 
A|79| A: Yes [, and] [, you] _know ,_ we [have] [, uh ,] needs [in] our life [that] [are] unique [to] us [and] [, uh [,] you] _know ,_ people [have] needs [in] their life [that] unique [to] us , [to] them . 
B|80| M: [You [know ,] uh [,] that's] pretty good . 
A|81| A: [I mean ,] we [are] all different _so_ , 
B|82| M: She's [a] human . 
A|83| A: [Well ,] [no] [that's] my _other phone ._ 
B|84| M: [And] ? [You] [are] [the] [one] [who] [is] talking [about] [the] [other phone .] 
A|85| A: _So [,_ that's] [it] [that's] okay , my , [that] [phone] [is] ringing [to] _an_ empty desk [and] _she's_ [on] vacation , 
B|86| M: She's [still] here [, I'm] [just] [not] sure [if] [she's] [a] good person [or] [not] . 
A|87| A: _so_ , [it's] okay . 
B|88| M: What [is] ? 
A|89| A: Uh-huh . _That's_ very expensive . 
B|90| M: [How] [much] [do [you] _think] [it_ is] ? 
A|91| A: Yes [, that's] _true ._ Orthodontic [work] [is] terribly expensive . 
B|92| M: [You] can _get_ [dental] [care] [at] [the] dentist [for] free . 
A|93| A: Especially [when] [you [have] [a] lot] [of] problems [with the] children _teeth_ [, and] [, and] [you have] [to] really [get] them [when] [they are] young , [in] order [to] [have] [, uh ,] [not [,] uh ,] [a] decent smile [when] [they are] fifteen , sixteen years old . 
B|94| M: [That's] [true .] 
A|95| A: [I] [know ,] two [of] my daughters _had to_ [have] [that] [and] [they] started having extractions [at] age eight [, uh ,] because [they] [just] [had] too _many teeth_ [for] their size mouth . 
B|96| M: [You] [mean] [like] [a] regular tooth ? 
A|97| A: [And] we footed _the bill_ , because [there] was [not] [any] such thing [and] [when] [they] were young . 
B|98| M: [You] [had to] foot [the bill] [for _the] teeth_ 
A|99| A: Oh , uh-huh . 
B|100| M: _It's_ [not] [an] orthodon . _It's_ [a] pallet . 
A|101| A: Uh-huh , major . 
B|102| M: [You know ,] he's [a] big guy 
A|103| A: Uh-huh . 
B|104| M: Uhhh [, what] ? 
A|105| A: [Well , I] tell [you] [I] [, [I] just] read [an] article [in the] paper [about] [what] [they are] doing [, I [think] it] was [an] ad [in] , [in] our publication [at] Texas Instruments , where [they are] breaking [the] jaw [and] [, and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with [the] teeth] . 
B|106| M: [How] [many teeth] [do [you] have] ? 
A|107| A: [It's] , [it's] less _painful_ [and] less expensive . 
B|108| M: Why [is] [it so] [painful] ? 
A|109| A: [Yeah] . 
B|110| M: [So ,] you're saying they're [not] ? 
A|111| A: [I] [, I] [know [,] but] [it ,] [it's] , [it's] [, uh ,] easier [on] [the] patient [in the] long run , which amazed me . 
B|112| M: Aesthetic [is] [the] most [important] part [of] [a] treatment .
