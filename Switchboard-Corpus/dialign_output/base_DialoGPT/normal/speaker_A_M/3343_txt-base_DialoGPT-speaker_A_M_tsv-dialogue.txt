B|0| M: _Oh_ ? What _do_ _you_ _think_ _about_ _it_ ? 
A|1| A: Uh-huh . 
B|2| M: Don't _you_ mean _the_ game ? 
A|3| A: Right . 
B|4| M: You _know , I_ _usually_ _have_ _to_ check _things_ . 
A|5| A: Uh-huh . 
B|6| M: Uuhuh . Uhuh . 
A|7| A: Of course , uh-huh . 
B|8| M: _And_ we've been saying this _for a_ long time _, but_ we've never had _it_ _work_ _, so_ we've always been _able to_ 
A|9| A: Right 
B|10| M: Because _of_ _the_ whole _, uh ,_ thing ? 
A|11| A: right , _just_ [to] get [you] by five years _and_ then you'll throw [it] away _rather_ _than have_ [it] _fixed_ 
B|12| M: _uh ,_ i'm _not_ _sure_ _what you_ mean . 
A|13| A: We're , we're [a] wasteful society , [for] [sure] . 
B|14| M: _I_ agree . I'd [rather] _be_ poor [than have] [a] high cost _of_ living . 
A|15| A: Right . Right . [And] [you] [usually] get [what you] pay [for] . _We_ bought some walkie-talkies [a] couple [of] years ago [for] Christmas , _and_ they were like ten dollars , _and_ _we_ expected them [to] [work] nice [for] [the] little kids , _and_ they didn't [work] worth _anything_ 
B|16| M: You're 
A|17| A: So _we_ took those back , _and_ _that's_ [about] _that_ all _that_ were taken back in ages . 
B|18| M: _I_ can _be_ [fixed] _, a lot of_ money . 
A|19| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|20| M: _It's_ [a] brand ? 
A|21| A: Right . 
B|22| M: _Yeah _,_ but_ [what] [about] lemon ? 
A|23| A: Right . 
B|24| M: You _know_ [what] ? 
A|25| A: [Oh] , _really_ _. It's_ hard . 
B|26| M: The lemon law _is_ pretty difficult [to] enforce . 
A|27| A: [Oh] , wow . 
B|28| M: [Yeah [.] It's] [a] _very_ slow process _, but_ [we] can't [really] _do_ [anything] without [a] lemon . 
A|29| A: Uh-huh , _and it_ _just_ pertained [to] _that_ 
B|30| M:  ... [and _it] was_ [just] _, you know ,_ _not_ _very_ 
A|31| A: [I] , at first [I] thought [of] food [, you know ,] because _that's_ [what] , mainly [what] [I] buy , [it] seems like , [and] [, uh [,] you [know ,] I] still don't [have] any , [anything] [to] [do] there [, but] , But [I] [, _I] think_ , too [, a lot of] people don't buy their warranties either because they [know] _that_ when _it's_ _that_ old they're going [to] buy [a] new _one_ , 
B|32| M:  ... 
A|33| A: [so] . 
B|34| M: That's _not_ [that] . 
A|35| A: [Yeah ,] my husband [is] [really] good at fixing [things] , too [, so] he [usually] , [be] [able to] fix [anything] _that's_ minor , [and] [and] [that] has saved us thousands [of] dollars [, you know ,] from [to] mechanic [to] [anything] like [that] 
B|36| M: That . 
A|37| A: [but] [, but] , [it was] interesting [to] [, I] don't [know] if they're making them better or [not] [, I] , _it's_ hard [to] say . Some [, _I] think_ they more [of] their parts plastic , which [, you know ,] makes [things] break easier [, but] _I think_ [the] technology [is] better . 
B|38| M: Ayea 
A|39| A: About quality . 
B|40| M: Ohh , why [you] . 
A|41| A: Right . 
B|42| M: [Yeah] [but] I'm [, you know ,] [the] [one] [that's] being made 
A|43| A: [Yeah ,] [Yeah .] 
B|44| M: Do [you] ? 
A|45| A: Right . Well , people aren't willing [to] pay those prices [very] often [, so] [, you know ,] [for a] handcrafted something [, so] 
B|46| M: [I think] [it's] [a] bit overpriced . 
A|47| A: [so] . So , if [we] get _what we_ _what we_ deserve 
B|48| M: [We] got [what we] wanted .
