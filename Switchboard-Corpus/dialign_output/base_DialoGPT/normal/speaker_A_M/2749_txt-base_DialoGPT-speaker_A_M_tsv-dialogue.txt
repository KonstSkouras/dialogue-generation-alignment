B|0| M: Hehehehe 
A|1| A: _Well ,_ what _about_ _the_ idea _that_ _one_ is only guilty _, uh_ , when proven guilty beyond _a_ reasonable doubt ? _I thought_ _that_ was _the_ point of _, uh_ , _a_ unanimous _jury_ was _the_ idea _that_ if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt . 
B|2| M: No . 
A|3| A: But , if there _are_ some _people_ who don't agree _uh_ , then there must be , it seems _to_ be there must be at least _a_ reasonable doubt for some _people_ . 
B|4| M: U 
A|5| A: Really ? Have _you_ served _on_ _a_ _jury_ ? 
B|6| M: That [, uh] . 
A|7| A: _I_ never have either , but my friends , my few friends who have [, uh] , say just _the_ opposite They say they're [, uh] , remarkably incompetent . And [, uh] , don't _know_ what they're doing and say _one_ thing in _the_ courtroom and then as soon as _they_ _get_ in _the_ back room _they_ just start letting all their prejudices hang out and _to_ , _to_ air , and all _that_ . 
B|8| M: _well_ 
A|9| A: Right , _, they_ don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of _the_ legal system . 
B|10| M:  
A|11| A: And _they_ tend , and since anyone can _get_ out of it who basically says _they_ don't want _to_ do it _, I_ mean _, you _know_ ,_ it's , it's anyone can _get_ out of _jury_ just _about_ , and [, uh] , so , it , it's [, uh] , it's _not_ really my peers _that_ , if _I_ _were_ let's say _I_ _were_ arrested falsely or _not_ and put up for _a_ _jury_ _I_ wouldn't feel _that_ [, uh] _, I_ would be being tried by _a_ _jury_ of my peers . 
B|12| M:  
A|13| A: I'd be _, I_ mean I'd be tried by _a_ _jury_ of _you _know_ ,_ _people_ who had nothing else _to_ do and weren't very knowledgeable _about_ certain sorts of things , and [, uh] _, I_ don't _know ,_ 
B|14| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _I_ _, I_ _get_ _a_ little bit nervous _about_ it , and [, uh] , 
B|16| M:  ... 
A|17| A: [Yeah] _, I_ _, I_ was called once , but _I_ was out of _the_ country , and apparently _I_ , apparently _they_ _thought_ _I_ served so _I_ didn't _, I_ didn't make any noise _about_ it _I_ came back and _they_ said _the_ record showed _I_ served , but _I_ was out of _the_ country at _the_ time , so _I'm_ pretty sure _I_ didn't . Uh , 
B|18| M: _So_ 
A|19| A: [Yeah] , [well] _, I_ _I_ _, I_ don't _know _,_ I_ definitely feel like we need _to_ keep it at least unanimous because [, uh] _, you _know_ ,_ there's _the_ classic sort of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD kind of story where _you get_ _, you _know_ ,_ 
B|20| M: [not] 
A|21| A: And [, uh] , it seems _to_ _me_ _that_ if _you_ could just have _a_ simple majority or something _you_ could pretty _much_ _you _know_ ,_ browbeat _the jury_ , _a_ majority , in _the_ , of _the_ , _a_ majority of _the jury_ , 
B|22| M: [I] 
A|23| A: that's hard _to_ say . Uh , so , it's , it's [, uh] _, you _know_ ,_ saying , [well] , look we don't like _the_ way he looks and , let's [, uh] , let's throw _the_ rascal in jail and stuff . 
B|24| M: Ah , um 
A|25| A: And _you_ also _get_ _a_ lot of [, uh] , juries _are_ extremely [, uh] , and from what [I] hear _, I_ _, I_ have _, I_ have some friends who do expert witness testimony and _they_ say _that_ [, uh] , juries _are_ extremely vulnerable _to_ [, uh] , sort of emotional pitches _, you _know_ ,_ _the_ prosecutor will want _to_ , oh _, I_ don't _know_ show _the_ , show _the_ mugging victim _, you _know_ ,_ show what _the_ nice person he was and what _a_ family life , and basically _get_ _the jury_ _to_ be very sympathetic with _the_ victim , and [, uh] , or , or [, uh] , if it's _a_ corporation , _that_ was [, uh] _, you _know_ ,_ harming some individual or something like _that_ _, they_ _get_ very _much_ , [well] _, you _know_ ,_ it's just _a_ big faceless corporation . Let's , let's make them _pay_ as _much_ as possible . Things like _that_ . 
B|26| M:  
A|27| A: [So] , [not] _, I_ _, I_ mean _, I'm_ , _the_ problem is [I] can't guarantee _that_ _a judge_ would be necessarily be _much_ better than _a_ _jury_ , but I'd be real nervous having _a_ _jury_ [not] at least fully agree _on_ what _the_ settlements would be , things like _that_ . 
B|28| M: [I] 
A|29| A: [Yeah .] 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: Uh-huh . _Well ,_ _how_ _about_ having _a_ _jury_ and _a judge_ work together _on_ it somehow ? _I wonder_ if that's possible ? _I guess_ _the_ judge's time is worth _too_ _much_ , though . 
B|32| M: [Well [,] [I] guess] 
A|33| A: They _pay_ _that_ _judge_ _, _they_ pay_ those _jury_ members very little _money_ compared _to_ _that_ _judge_ 
B|34| M: [I wonder] [how] [much] [money] [they pay] [to] [the] [judge] . 
A|35| A: He makes more [money] in an hour than all _twelve_ of them put together . 
B|36| M: He's [not] [a judge] . 
A|37| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|38| M: What [about] [a] [twelve] [people] ? 
A|39| A: _Oh ,_ of course . It's , it's political maneuvering . The , _the one_ side is looking for someone whose face [they] think will _, you _know_ ,_ want [to] hang everyone , and [the] other _one_ is going [to] look for someone very sympathetic . They're [not] looking for someone who's going [to] be [the] most reasoned or sensible or rational juror . *whose who's Neither side wants _that_ . They want [to] find [a] juror that's going [to] [, uh] , be most persuadable by their arguments _, you know ._ 
B|40| M:  
A|41| A: Uh [, I] wish it _were_ [a] little bit harder [to] [not] _serve on_ juries actually _. I_ mean [, I] _know ,_ it , it , it's tricky because [I] _know , you _know_ ,_ an awful lot of intelligent [people] who just , [well] _I'm_ _too_ busy _to serve on_ [a] _jury_ , 
B|42| M:  ... 
A|43| A: so I'll tell them _that_ and [they] won't , or just _, you _know_ ,_ just answer _one_ of [the] questions [the] wrong way because _you_ can do _that_ _, you _know_ ,_ 
B|44| M: You 
A|45| A: [they] just say do _you_ believe in such and such . Uh , 
B|46| M: You [know [, you know] .] 
A|47| A: Right . Course , they'd be _, they_ would be barred , but 
B|48| M: [Well [,] they] [are] 
A|49| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] , [well] it sounds like we both need [to] _get_ out there and _serve on_ [a] _jury ._ 
B|50| M: Ohh ... 
A|51| A: _I hope_ we're called up before _too_ long . 
B|52| M: [Well [,] [I] hope] [you get] [to serve on] [the [jury] .] 
A|53| A: They will [, they] will eventually . Okay , [well] it was nice talking with [you] . 
B|54| M: [Oh [,] I'm] sorry [. [I] thought] [you] [were] [the one] [that] asked [me] [to] go [on] [the] mission . 
A|55| A: Bye-bye .
