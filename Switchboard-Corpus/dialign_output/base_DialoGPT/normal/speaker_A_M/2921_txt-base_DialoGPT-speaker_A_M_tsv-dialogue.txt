B|40| M: [So] [uh [,] how] did [it] _go_ ? 
A|41| A: [and we're] leasing [a] [, uh ,] two story _town_ home _in a_ section _of_ Dallas _they call_ _North_ Dallas . 
B|42| M: _Uh _,_ you know what_ [to do .] [uh] ? 
A|43| A: _And_ [it's] [, uh ,] near _a little_ _town_ _called_ Plano , well _, it's not_ _little_ any more .

B|46| M: [That's] ... _a lot of_ drive 
A|47| A: _It's _,_ yeah ,_ _That's why_ [we] _not sure_ [, we] , [we're] _not sure_ [we] want [to] [, uh ,] buy _down_ _here_ , _because_ [we] actually [, we] lived [up] north long enough [to] appreciate [the] , um , *listen--one utt ? Minneapolis-Saint Paul [is] very _clean_ 
B|48| M: [Yeah [,] yeah ,] ya , er [, that's] 
A|49| A: _you know ,_ [in] terms [of] , *listen; _with_ previous slash unit ? [and] [in] terms [of] housing _down_ _here_ , um [, you] really _have your_ pick _but it's_ [just] everything's overpriced _for_ _the economy_ . 
B|50| M: _You_ [have] _you ,_ 
A|51| A: It really _is [,_ I] _mean_ [we're] , _we're [in_ a] leased _town_ home _, and_ [it's] [, uh ,] _you're_ _probably_ , _your teeth_ will _probably_ fall _out_ figuratively speaking [, it's] nine hundred [a] month . 
B|52| M:  . 
A|53| A: _But [,_ you know what] _, if_ [you _,] if_ [you] get anything under five hundred [you] get into [what] _they call_ high density [living] _you know _,_ the_ _big_ _apartment_ complexes 
B|54| M: What's [your] [apartment] ? 
A|55| A: _and _,_ and_ [I] [just] [have] _no_ tolerance _for_ _that ._ 
B|56| M: You're _right , it's_ [probably] [your teeth] . 
A|57| A: [No] . 
B|58| M: [And] [you] 
A|59| A: [Yeah] this _is [,_ it's] _like_ [a] duplex _, like_ [a] two _by_ two _they call it_ _like_ [in Pittsburgh .] 
B|60| M: _Are you_ [saying] [that] [the] _people_ _in that_ [area] _think_ _they're_ _living _in_ the_ ghetto ? 
A|61| A: [And] [it's] _nice_ _but it's_ [, I] _mean_ _, the_ girl _bought it_ _for a_ hundred [and] ten _, and_ _now_ she [can't] sell _it _._ And_ our neighbors , 
B|62| M: The neighborhood ? 
A|63| A: [Yeah [,] I] _mean_ , we'll , our neighbors _, the_ attached _on _the_ other side_ _, they're_ very _nice ,_ thank God , 
B|64| M: [And] _that's why [we're_ _in] the_ market [for] houses , huh ? 
A|65| A: _they_ paid fifty-eight [for] _it ._ 
B|66| M: _You_ should [have] [bought it] 
A|67| A: [That's] [how] _bad_ _it [,_ _I] know ._ 
B|68| M: _How_ [bad] [is it ?] 
A|69| A: [That's] _right ._ Uh-huh [, yeah] [. _I] have_ some friends [that] [live in] Westport [and] [it's] really , really [bad] [. I] _mean_ [you ,] 
B|70| M: That [is] [a] _real_ [place] . 
A|71| A: Uh-huh . 
B|72| M: Yes _, but it's _a_ lot of_ houses 
A|73| A: [How] far , _where_ [is] Clarion County [in] relation [to] , actually , _because_ [we're] considering moving [to] [Pennsylvania] 
B|74| M: [Uh _,] what_ ? 
A|75| A: [That's] _not too_ [bad] . [That's] north . 
B|76| M: [I'm] _in the_ middle [of] [Pennsylvania] . 
A|77| A: [Are you] _going_ [up] toward [, uh [,] uh [,] I'm] trying [to] [think] _of the_ name [of] [that] _town_ [that] starts _with_ _an_ M , _Bradford_ _, no_ [that's] _too_ far north . 
B|78| M: [It's] [a] small [town] [in] central PA . 
A|79| A: [So] _you're_ , _you're_ _not that_ far north [then ,] okay . 
B|80| M: [I] [live in] [Bradford] . 
A|81| A: [Well ,] _you're_ really _not too_ [bad] . [Yeah .] 
B|82| M: _I'm [not_ too] _good_ [with] names 
A|83| A: _Um ,_ _was_ [it] [a] home [that] you've had [for] quite [a] few years , or [that] you've , 
B|84| M: [Um [,] yes] . 
A|85| A: [Oh ,] [then] [you] [have] [, yeah] . Do [you] [have [a] lot of] _land_ or , 
B|86| M: [I [have] _a] _house_ ,_ _so_ [I can] [live in] [it .] 
A|87| A: [Oh ,] my , well , [then] . 
B|88| M: _I don't_ _think it's_ [the] _same_ , I've _been in_ [it] since [I] [was] six . 
A|89| A: There [you] [go] . Did [you] [have a] hard _time_ getting used [to] , _do you_ feel _like _you_ _live_ in an_ isolated [area] or , 
B|90| M: _I [,_ uh ,] _don't_ [know .] 
A|91| A: [Yeah _,] I think_ [that] _that's ,_ um [, [I] can] remember [in Pittsburgh] _when_ , this has [to do] [with] homes [, uh ,] indirectly _but [I_ can] remember _when_ _Upper Saint_ Clair [was] _out_ [in the] _, you know _,_ the_ rural end [of] Washington , 
B|92| M: [Upper Saint] Clare 
A|93| A: [and] _now_ [it's] [it's a] terrible _connection ._ 
B|94| M: [It's] [not] [a] [connection _.] It's_ _a city_ 
A|95| A: [Oh ,] well [that's] okay , um , 
B|96| M: _I'm not_ [from] [the] [area [,] I'm] [from] [Pittsburgh _,] I don't_ [have a] clue [about] [the] internet _, but_ _I'm not going to_ 
A|97| A: _But [,_ but] [, yeah ,] substantially [, you [know] .] [Um ,] _do you_ _like_ [living _in] an_ older home [and] restoring [it] _like_ [that] ? 
B|98| M: [I know [.] [And] [,] we] [live in an] _old_ [house] . [But [,] I'm] [in _a] house_ [with] _a [nice_ ,] [clean] , quiet [place] . 
A|99| A: [How] _big_ [is it ?] [How] _many_ square feet _do you_ [have] ? 
B|100| M: [I'm] [down] , I've _been_ looking [for a] [place] [to] [live] [for a] while [now .] 
A|101| A: [Well] _how many_ rooms _do you_ [think] [, yeah] ? 
B|102| M: Uhh [, no] [. _I'm] not_ . 
A|103| A: Uh-huh . 
B|104| M: [I guess] [you're] [right .] 
A|105| A: Uh-huh . 
B|106| M: We're _all [in_ a] bath . 
A|107| A: _A_ junk _room [,_ yeah] [I] understand [, we have] [that] [too] . [That's] [, that's] large _if_ [your] children aren't _at_ home any more . 
B|108| M: [I think] [we _have] one_ [room [,] but] [that's] _all_ 
A|109| A: [That's] large _if_ [your] kids aren't _at_ home any more . 
B|110| M: That [is] huge 
A|111| A: Uh-huh . 
B|112| M: This [is] [a big] problem . 
A|113| A: [It's] enough space [for] two [people] [Yeah .] 
B|114| M: [What] [do you] [mean] ? 
A|115| A: [Oh ,] okay . 
B|116| M: [I] [was] joking . 
A|117| A: [Yeah _,] right ._ [That's] okay . [Well ,] we've _got_ , um , this [town] [house] [is] _pretty_ [big] [. It's] [about] eighteen hundred square feet [. It's] _got_ three bedrooms , two [and] [a] half baths 
B|118| M: [Well [,] they're] [not] [out] [on the] _street_ . 
A|119| A: um [, it's] really [nice] . 
B|120| M: [Well _,] I don't_ [know .] 
A|121| A: [Yeah _,] it_ _is [,_ I] [mean] [, I] would never buy [it] [but] leasing [it] [is] fine . 
B|122| M: [That's] _a great deal_ . 
A|123| A: [Um [,] but] [, it's] [just] again _, the_ _, the_ privacy [, you [know] .] [Um [,] we] had [a house] [in Minneapolis] [that] [was] [on] three acres _, and_ my husband [was] raised , um , [on] [a [working] farm] near 
B|124| M: [Well [,] the] owner [is] [a] lawyer . 
A|125| A: [right ,] near Dayton , Ohio _, and_ _he_ [said] _, you know _,_ he's_ _, he's_ slowly getting _me_ [to] , um _, not_ feel isolated _if_ [we] _move_ [to] _where_ there's more _land ._ 
B|126| M:  ... [where] [do [you] live] ? 
A|127| A: Right . 
B|128| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|129| A: Uh-huh . 
B|130| M: _You_ [can't] [have your] _own_ [land .] 
A|131| A: [That's] kind [of] [what] _, like_ his parents [have] [, uh ,] [land] [that] _they_ retired [to] , um , [about] [a] hundred miles _out of_ Atlanta _and ,_ [in] Georgia , 
B|132| M: He's [a big] guy [, he's] [got] [a big] gun _, he_ [can] [do] whatever [he] wants . 
A|133| A: [and] [it] [is] [too] far south _for me_ , 
B|134| M: Uhh _, what_ [about] [it ?] 
A|135| A: [but] , um , um _, but I_ [mean] , _they_ [have one] _of the_ , um , _when_ _they_ [said] log cabin [, I] [just] laughed , [that] _they_ retired [to] [, but] _they_ built [one] [of] these [. I] [mean] [, it's] [just] _beautiful [._ _It's] like_ [a] custom [, you know] _it's not_ _like_ [what I] would [think] [of] _when [I_ think] [of] [old] log cabins . [You] _know [,_ I] [mean] [, it's] _modern_ [it's] , 
B|136| M: LOLGlad . 
A|137| A: Right _, [right_ , it's] _modern [,_ it's] _beautiful_ [, it's] country 
B|138| M: _A lot of_ _all_ [of] [modern ,] _all_ [of] course 
A|139| A: [it's] _you know ,_ um [, but] _, uh , I don't_ [, what] else [about] housing except [it's] [, uh ,] well , Pittsburgh's housing _economy _,_ I think it's_ holding [it's] [own] . 
B|140| M: [It's [,] _is] , uh [,_ is] 
A|141| A: [What] part [, what] sections _are_ _they_ [in] ? [Yeah [,] that's] [nice] . 
B|142| M: [I think] [they're] [in the] mountains [, but I] _could_ _be_ 
A|143| A: Great . 
B|144| M:  ... [and] ? 
A|145| A: Uh-huh . 
B|146| M: Which [one] ? 
A|147| A: Uh-huh . [That's] [, yeah ,] [a] really [good] friend [of] mine lives [in] Penn Hills _, and_ they've [been in] their [house ,] oh , [probably] [about] twelve years [now] 
B|148| M: [I'm] sorry [, but] _I'm [not_ sure] [what] [you] [mean] [by] [that .] 
A|149| A: _and ,_ um [, it's] [, it's] _, you know [,_ they're] [going to] start [to] _see_ their return [on] their investment very soon . 
B|150| M: Uhh [, I think] [you] might [have] [the] wrong person [here] . 
A|151| A: [Um [,] but it's a] _beautiful_ home _and [,_ I] [mean] , my brother lives , 
B|152| M: Uuhhh [, yes] ? 
A|153| A: [is it] [called] Baldwin or Bebble ? 
B|154| M: [It's [,] like] , [beautiful .] 
A|155| A: [I] [mean] [, he] lives [all [in] that] [same] [area] [going] [from] Mount Lebanon , um [, it's] [real] _pretty_ [up] there [. It's] [just] , 
B|156| M: [Oh , that's a] [pretty] cool [place] . 
A|157| A: [And] [the] neighborhoods _are_ stable [you [know] .] 
B|158| M: [That's why] [they call it] [the] [North] . 
A|159| A: [It's [,] uh ,] _when_ [you] come [to] this part _of the_ country , we've [been] away [from] Dallas long enough [that] [you] _see the_ difference [in] housing . 
B|160| M: Wait [, what] ? 
A|161| A: [Oh ,] my goodness . 
B|162| M: This [is] [how] [I] felt [when I] [was] [married] _to a_ guy [from] [Texas] . 
A|163| A: Uh-huh . [That's what] [it] [is] [here] [, yeah [,] [that's] why we're] _at_ [a] point [now] we've [, uh ,] [we're] adopting [and] [we have] [been] [married] ten plus years [and] [what] happens [is , uh [,] you] [just] realize [that] once [you] get [to a] certain age [the] next [house] [that] [you] get we'll [be] staying [in] [Yeah ,] 
B|164| M:  ... 
A|165| A: [that's] kind [of] [like] [where] [we're] , 
B|166| M: [And] [we have] [to] [move] [out of] 
A|167| A: [so] [we're] considering [Pennsylvania] _, [and_ we're] [just] kind [of] _, you know ,_ toying [with] [what] exactly , [where] [we] want [to] [be] [, you [know] .] 
B|168| M: Where [are] [we] 
A|169| A: [A lot of] _people say_ [it] doesn't matter [where] [they] [live] _if_ [they] [have [a] nice] [house] _and [,_ but I] disagree [with] [that] [, I] . 
B|170| M: [I] [do] [, I think it's] weird [how many] [people say] [they] [don't] [live [in] a] [place that] matters . 
A|171| A: Uh-huh . 
B|172| M: [Well [,] if] [you're] [a] native American [, you] should _probably be_ . 
A|173| A: [I _know] _,_ and_ _it _,_ and_ _the economy_ [here] [in] Dallas [, I] [mean] _, it [,_ it's] steady [, but it's] _still_ [not going] [up] . 
B|174| M: [It's] [because] [of [the] [economy] [,] not] [the] [people] . 
A|175| A: [And] [I ,] um [, I] [just] refuse [to] buy _it ,_ um [, if] [I know] [I'm not going to] [be] there [for] _at_ least five years [, uh _,] you [,_ you [know] .] 
B|176| M: Uhhh [, [I] [,] uh , I don't] [know .] 
A|177| A: [Oh [,] I'm] [sure] [, yeah ,] there [, I] [mean] _, you can_ [go] [down] [a] [street] _, and_ [here] [, he] told [you] this , every _other_ [house _,] you know [,_ if] [it's] [been] foreclosed [on] or _, you know ,_ even [big] executives 
B|178| M: [I'm [,] it [,] [I'm] [,] you [,] [that's] [,] [I] ,] 
A|179| A: um [, it's] really [, I] [mean] _, and _,_ and_ [it's] hard [to] sell [the] properties . People [from] J C Penney's [from] New York , came [here] [about] [a] couple [of] years ago . 
B|180| M: [I [,] and [,] right .] 
A|181| A: [And] [they] thought [they] were getting [a great deal] , um , [because] [they] [could] get [a] five hundred thousand dollar home [with] , [they call [it] ,] zero [lot] lines [, no] property , [And] [it] would [make] [you] ill [to] _see_ this . 
B|182| M: I'll , yuh , money 
A|183| A: [I] [mean] [it] would [probably be] [like] [your] [house] [on] [, uh _,] you know ,_ [a] half [a city] block [in Pittsburgh] or [something] . 
B|184| M: The 
A|185| A: [Yeah [,] [I] _know] [,_ and] [that's _,] you know [,_ like] [I _can] look_ outside [right] [now] [and] _look_ into [the] next unit . 
B|186| M: [It's [like] [you] can] [see the] future . 
A|187| A: [You] _know [,_ it's] across [the] way [, and] [it's] landscaped [and] [all] [that] [with] azaleas , 
B|188| M: Hey [, you know [,] you [can] look] [at] [the other side] [of the] wall [, and] it'll [look] [right] [back] [at] [you] 
A|189| A: [but it's] _still , it's_ _still_ _not that_ private . 
B|190| M: [It's] [still [, it's] [not] that] [bad] 
A|191| A: [Yeah] [but] [you] [have a] rider . 
B|192| M: There's [no] such [thing] as [a] [bad] [time] [for me] . 
A|193| A: [No [,] and] [your] kids [have] , [to] tell [you] [the] truth , um [, I think] [that] [if] [you can] keep [that] , [that] way [, you know ,] kind [of] [like] [a] homestead ,
