B|0| M: _I think _the_ cowboys_ _are_ _pretty good_ 
A|1| A: Uh-huh . 
B|2| M: _So_ _did_ _the Cowboys_ . 
A|3| A: Yeah , they're _going to_ _get_ _better ._ [I] mean _, you_ _know_ . 
B|4| M: _I don't_ _think_ we'll [get] _any_ [better .] 
A|5| A: Yeah . As long as Troy Aikman doesn't [get] hurt again . _That_ kind _of_ killed _them_ at [the] end _of the_ season _last year ._ 
B|6| M: If _the team_ does _well ,_ _I'll_ _be_ glad _if_ _we_ _can_ _get a_ decent amount [of] experience _out of_ [them] . 
A|7| A: [So] _, [I_ don't] _, [I_ don't] _even_ _know_ who your favorite [team] _is_ , actually . 
B|8| M: We're _not_ 
A|9| A: Okay . [I think] [I] [did] _know_ _that_ _, I_ just forgot . Okay . 
B|10| M: Nah _. I'm_ _a_ _Vikings_ _fan ._ 
A|11| A: Yeah . Has Herschel Walker done much _for_ [them] ? 
B|12| M: _I don't know _,_ I guess_ you're _right_ . 
A|13| A: Definitely _. _Well_ ,_ _he was a_ [good] player . [I guess] , [well] [I don't know ,] _he_ just never [, [I] don't know ,] _for_ [a] while there , 
B|14| M: _Cowboys_ ? The only [team] _that was_ _ever really_ _in_ contention _for the_ NFC North ? 
A|15| A: _Well ,_ _he_ could always [get] past _, you_ [know ,] he'd [get] past _like_ six or seven tackles _and_ just keep spinning around _and_ [get] _on_ into [the] end zone . But , um [, I guess] _you_ never could [really] see him play , because _with_ [the Cowboys] , while _he was_ _with_ [the team] , [the] rest _of [the_ team] [was] [pretty] poor so _you_ couldn't [really] tell [if] _it_ [was] just him or [the team] _and_ [I] always just assumed [that] _he was_ too [good] [for the] rest _of [the_ team] . But [, [I] don't know] . 
B|16| M: [I] 
A|17| A: Emmett Smith _, yeah_ . 
B|18| M: You . 
A|19| A: he's _been_ doing real [good] [. I'm] [pretty] impressed _with_ him so far . 
B|20| M: [That] _is _it_ ._ 
A|21| A: Did _he_ , [did] _he_ actually play _in the_ Pro _Bowl ._ _I remember_ _he was_ _like_ [a] backup _and then_ somebody _got_ injured _and_ _he was_ supposed _to_ _go ._ 
B|22| M: Nah [he was a] rookie [last year .] 
A|23| A: Yeah [, I] kind [of] [, I] haven't _been_ keeping up _with_ football [, I] mean , _in the_ fall [I] [, I] [can] _go_ _on_ _and_ _on_ _about_ football , but _since_ it's kind [of] off season , it's kind [of] hard _to_ [think] back _about_ _all_ _that ._ But , uh , 
B|24| M: Not _sure_ . 
A|25| A: Yeah . 
B|26| M: This [is] ? 
A|27| A: Um [, I] _have_ no idea . 
B|28| M: _What_ ? 
A|29| A: _No_ earthly idea . 
B|30| M: _What_ _is the_ name [of the] coach ? 
A|31| A: How [did] _they_ end up this [year] ? Did _they_ , [did] _they_ make [it] _to_ [the] play-offs at _all_ ? 
B|32| M: We [got] [the] _first_ pick [in the] NFC East _, and then_ _we got_ [a] QB _that wasn't_ [even] [the] _first_ overall pick . 
A|33| A: Uh-huh . 
B|34| M: _They_ [got] lucky [with] [that] _first_ round exit . 
A|35| A: Kind [of] _like_ [the cowboys] , huh . 
B|36| M: The Rams , Chiefs _, and_ [the] Chiefs [have] [all] won _Super_ Bowls . 
A|37| A: Except [I think [the] _Cowboys] are_ _on the_ upswing [I don't know] _about_ [the] [Vikings] 
B|38| M: The [Vikings] [and] [Cowboys are] both [on the] downswing 
A|39| A: Just hadn't heard much _about_ [them] lately . 
B|40| M: _Oh [._ Well] [I think] [I'm] _going to do_ [it] _anyway_ . 
A|41| A: Yeah [. _Well] ,_ [the] Cardinals [, [I] don't know] . [I think [the] Cowboys] probably _have a_ , [a] [better] [team] . [They] just , at [the] end [of the] season , [the] kind [of] [got] messed up [with] Aikman getting hurt , because , uh , Laufenberg just couldn't [ever really] [get] [it] together at [all] . Of course , [he] sat along [the] sidelines [all] season , [he] never [really] [got] [in] [a] game , never [did] [a] whole lot . 
B|42| M: [I] 
A|43| A: _Well ,_ [I'm] just saying [I] shouldn't [, I] shouldn't blast him _like_ [that] , say , oh [well ,] Laufenberg [got] [out] there [and] blew [it] [for] [them] [, I] mean , [he] didn't [get] [to] see much action . But , too bad . Because now , now _, you_ [know ,] [he] had [a] shot [and] [, and] didn't look too [good] [and] so , no one's [going to] [have] much faith [in] him [any] more . 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: In fact [, [I] think] they're getting [a] different guy [for] [a] backup quarterback . [I] haven't , uh [, I] haven't kept up [with] [it] lately , but _I remember_ reading something [a] few months ago _about_ [them] signing somebody else [on] , or , or trying [to] _go_ after somebody or trade [for] somebody , but [it] [wasn't] anybody I'd [really] heard [of] . But [I] heard [on the] radio this morning , or yesterday morning , [that] , uh , Aikman's back [in] practicing , doing real , real [well] . Um , who [is it] , Michael Irvin 
B|46| M: ' 
A|47| A: [he] said [that] , uh , Aikman [was] hitting him [right] [on the] numbers every time . [So] , sounds _like_ he's [going to] [be] [all] [right] [for] next season . They're just trying [not] [to] overwork him [right] now , until [he] gets his shoulder , uh , back [in] [it] [was] his shoulder , [wasn't] [it] , [that] [he] had [the] problems [with] ? 
B|48| M: s 
A|49| A: [I think] [it] [, [I] think] [it] [was] his shoulder [he] had surgery [on] . But [anyway] , they're trying [to] keep him _, you_ [know ,] keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but [anyway] 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: _Thirty_ day notice [for] what ? 
B|52| M: [Thirty] days ? 
A|53| A: _Oh ,_ [really] . 
B|54| M: He [was] told by [the] doctor [to] stop . 
A|55| A: [What] . _Oh ,_ _okay_ , maybe [I'll] call _you_ back after , after [the] recording [is] finished . Actually [I think] [we] [have] talked _about_ football [for] five minutes . [I] _can't_ _remember_ . 
B|56| M: [Well [,] you] [can't] [really] _talk _about_ that ._ 
A|57| A: Really . _I usually_ [have] , too . 
B|58| M: [Oh [,] _yeah] [,_ [I] usually] _do ._ 
A|59| A: Yeah , I've done [that] once or twice . [I] didn't look at [the] clock _when_ [we] started talking , so [I guess] [we] should [talk about] football [a] little bit longer just [to] [be] [sure] [we got] five minutes [in] . 
B|60| M: _It's_ [okay] . 
A|61| A: Yeah . [So] other than [the] [Vikings] , who [do] [you] _like_ ? 
B|62| M: [I] [like] . 
A|63| A: Uh , oh . 
B|64| M: [No] [, I] _was the_ coach . 
A|65| A: Yeah . 
B|66| M: [They] [have a] history [of] letting [the] best _players_ [go .] 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . Back _when they_ were [in] Saint Louis ? 
B|68| M: [I remember] [when they] won [the] _Super [Bowl_ .] 
A|69| A: Since they've _been_ [to] Phoenix [they] haven't _been_ , uh , [all] [that] impressive [, I guess] . [I guess] I've always _been_ [a] Cowboy [fan .] Other than [that] [, I] mean [, you] [know ,] [when] I've [, you] [know ,] [when] [you] grow up [in] [a] city [that] has [the] [, you] [know ,] one [of the] greatest football teams until [the] [last] few years [, you] kind [of] tend [to] [get] caught up [in] [it .] 
B|70| M:  
A|71| A: Yeah . 
B|72| M: _They've_ [been] [in the] NFL [since] [the] 70s 
A|73| A: Yeah [, I] mean [it] , [it] [was] [really] exciting , growing up [when] , [when] [the Cowboys] were [really] big . Because my parents would always [have] season tickets [, and] they'd [go] [to] [all] [the] games [, and] [you] [know ,] [the] hype were just unbelievable . [It's] just [, you] [know ,] [the] [last] , oh [I guess] probably [since] [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when they] started kind [of] [going] downhill [really] , but [, you] [know ,] [I'm] just used [to] always growing up [and] hearing [Cowboys] , [Cowboys] , [Cowboys] [, and] [, you] [know ,] [Super Bowl] [, and] [all] this other stuff . [So] [, I] [can't] [, you] [know ,] [I'm] [not] [going to] decide [I don't] [like] [them] just because they're having [a] few bad years . [I] mean [, [I] think] they'll pull [out of] [it] [, and] [, you] [know ,] they'll , they'll wind up being [good] again . [They've] [got] some , lot [of] [really] [good] young [players] [that] [are] [going to] , [that] [are] [going to] , uh , [do] [pretty good] [, [I] think] . But , they're raising prices [on] their tickets . [So] they're banking [on] doing [good] next season . [I think] tickets [are] , 
B|74| M: [Oh ,] Debor 
A|75| A: Yeah . 
B|76| M:  ... 
A|77| A: [Thirty] , or thirty-two [for] [really] [good] tickets . See , [they] , [they] sectioned [it] [out] [even] more . [They] used [to] just [have] [like] , uh , [first] [of] [all] [it] [was] [all] one price . And [then] [they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] end zone [and then] everything else . And now they're sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] , from one twenty yard line [to] [the] other one , just [on the] lower levels [is the] highest price [, and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] same area but above [it] [on the] upper level [, and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . And [then] they're some sections kind [of] [in the] corner areas [, and then] [the] cheapest [of] course [is] [going to] [be] [the] end , [the] direct end zones . But , um , [they] [have] [about] four or five different prices now , [that] they're structuring [it] [with] , but obviously [yeah ,] they're [all] [going] up , more or less [is] what it's [going to [do] .] 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: Um [, you] [know ,] [I'm] [not] [sure] , [I'm] [not] positive [, I] didn't [, I] didn't [really] [think] [about that .] [I] just [remember] trying [to] figure [out] where [you] could [get] [that was] real close [to] [the] [good] section but [in the] little bit cheaper . But , [not] [that] [I'll] [ever] [go .] [I] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [Cowboys] game , time , [last] time [I] went [to] [the Cowboys] game [was] during [that] , um , N F L strike , or [the] , [when they] had [the] scab [team] , teams [in] there [, and] [it] [was the] , uh , Dallas [and] Washington Redskins game . And [I] went because my dad [can] [usually] [get a] hold [of] some free tickets , because [a] lot [of] those doctors [have] season tickets [, and] [they] , um , [if] they're [not] [going to] use [them] they'll give [them] [to] somebody else . [So] my dad [, I] went [with] my dad [to] [a] game [that] one time . But [that wasn't] [a] real [, you] [know ,] [it] [was] , [it] [was the] scab teams , [it] [was] kind [of] [, you] [know ,] [it] [was] kind [of] different [, I guess] . And before [that] it's [been] quite [a] few years . I've [been] wanting [to] [go] [to] [a] game [, I] just never , never [have] gotten around [to] [it .] [So] maybe this [year .]

And now they're sectioning it off to like from the , from one twenty yard line to the other one , just on the lower levels is the highest price , and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line . And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas , and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end , the direct end zones . But , um , they have about four or five different prices now , that they're structuring it with , but obviously yeah , they're all going up , more or less is what it's going to do .

I hadn't been to a Cowboys game , time , last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that , um , N F L strike , or the , when they had the scab team , teams in there , and it was the , uh , Dallas and Washington Redskins game . And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , and they , um , if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else . So my dad , I went with my dad to a game that one time . But that wasn't a real , you know , it was , it was the scab teams , it was kind of , you know , it was kind of different , I guess .
