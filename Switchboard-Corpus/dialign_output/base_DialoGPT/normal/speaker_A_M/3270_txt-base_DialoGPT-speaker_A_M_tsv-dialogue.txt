A|3| A: That , 
B|4| M: [I] [, uh [,] I] [, uh] ... _I don't know ._ 
A|5| A: _Uh ,_ State _of_ Minnesota . 
B|6| M: Where _are_ [you] from ? 
A|7| A: [So] there's [the] potential _that_ perhaps , _you _know_ ,_ _the U_ _S_ budget might want _to_ take _a_ look at [it's] [, uh ,] federal employees or _, and_ take _a_ look at saying , _well ,_ let's freeze wages . [I] mean everybody's doing it _so_ it isn't _like_ [, uh ,] private business _has_ had _to_ do it 
B|8| M: _I'm_ pretty _sure_ _they're_ _just_ _looking_ [for a] way [to] make _money ._ 
A|9| A: _so_ it might _have_ [to] be something _that_ _they_ might consider doing as [a] that's got [to] be very short term . 
B|10| M: _The_ [U] . [S] . Government _is_ _not_ [the] _one_ [that] [has] [to] deal _with [the_ U] . 
A|11| A: And [the] only other avenue [that] [I] can _think_ _of_ [is] [, uh ,] [looking] at where [they're] _spending_ [the] [money] _and_ [not] _so_ much as saying , _well ,_ we're _spending_ too much _in_ [that] area as perhaps [looking] at _what_ [is] costing them [the] [money .] As [for] , [for] instance [, _I] think you_ probably remember _the military_ getting _caught_ , um , [with] toilet seats [that] cost them four hundred , five hundred dollars . 
B|12| M:  
A|13| A: And it _was_ [just] [, I] mean [you] can _go to_ K-Mart _and_ buy them [for] [, uh ,] eight dollars or _I think_ six dollars or whatever [for] toilet seats , 
B|14| M: [you _know] ._ 
A|15| A: _so_ . [So] it gives [you] _idea_ [that] , 
B|16| M: [I think [you] know] ? 
A|17| A: Sure , [sure] . [So ,] 
B|18| M: [I think you] need [to] [go to] [a] school [to] learn [the military] [, and] [military] research [is] [not] _done_ [in] school . 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: You [know ,] _there_ _are_ [some] _things that are_ [better] _than_ _this ,_ [like] [the] way _the government_ works . 
A|21| A: Than we [think] . Sure . Sure . 
B|22| M: [So] what's your _point_ ? 
A|23| A: Uh-huh . It [sure] [is] . [The] , [you [know] ,] as _far_ as [, [I] think] [there] _was_ something [with [the] government] official [that] went on conferences [for] two days [and] actually [, uh ,] [the] conferences were nothing but [, uh ,] [you [know] ,] [they're] getting paid [for] [this [,] and] it _was_ something more [than] [just] [the] conferences . _They_ were using it as eating out _, uh , when_ [you] [think] _about_ _people_ [, uh ,] taking vacations these big [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|24| M: You . 
A|25| A: [The] rest _of_ them taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' _money for_ [that] . 
B|26| M: [I] love how [is] [the] [idea] [of course] [they] _have a_ bunch [of] [the military] [spending] , [military] _spending [money_ .] 
A|27| A: And [it's] [a] real big crunch [, uh] 
B|28| M: [The] . 
A|29| A: [of course] _, when they_ get _caught_ then [they're] , [you [know] ,] [they're] guilty [of course] , but [, uh ,] during [that] time [I'm] [sure] there's hundreds [of] [, uh ,] thousands _of people_ [that are] [, uh ,] [spending money] [that] does [not] belong [to] them . [So ,] 
B|30| M: What [about] [the] millions [of people] who [have] never been [caught] ? 
A|31| A: Uh-huh . 
B|32| M: [Uh [,] uh [, when] they] catch [you] , uh'uh 
A|33| A: Sure . 
B|34| M: [well [,] uh [,] uh] huh . 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . Exactly . And [I don't] [think] [, uh [,] it's] ended up _being_ [, I] mean it gave [people] jobs 
B|36| M: That's _a lot of_ [money [for] a] country [that] [was] [so] [far] away from [being] [the] most powerful nation [in] [the] world . 
A|37| A: but [I think] it also cost , um , quite [a] bit as [far] as because after [they're] [done] [with the] war , [a lot of] [things] were no longer put [to] use . [I] mean it [was] kind [of] [like] , okay , we'll do [this] during [this] [point] [and] time but after [that] that's , [you [know] [,] uh] [they] didn't want [to] do it anymore . 
B|38| M: Yeah 
A|39| A: [So ,] [a lot of] [things that are] saying [that] [they're] no longer going [to] be doing [for] next wars [that are] coming up [that] [they] did [for] [this] [one] [in] getting rid [of] [a lot of] [things] . [So] [I don't know .] 
B|40| M: [They] [are] [done] 
A|41| A: Okay , [well ,] it [was] good talking [to] [you] [and] [have a] good evening . 
B|42| M: You [know] 
A|43| A: Uh-huh , thanks .
