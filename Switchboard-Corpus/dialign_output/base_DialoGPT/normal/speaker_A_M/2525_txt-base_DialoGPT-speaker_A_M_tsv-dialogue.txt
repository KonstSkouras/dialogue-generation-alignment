B|54| M: You [are] correct _. They_ [are] _not_ [the] same . 
A|55| A: _We_ _don't_ [have] _, I_ guess too much trouble [in] [Dallas] [with _,] well _,_ I_ guess _, I_ guess [we] do [have _a lot] of_ _people_ _come in_ [from] _Mexico_ [, that] cause _problems_ [, but] [, _uh] ._ 
B|56| M: [They're] _not_ [going] [to] [come in] [because] _they have_ [no] [problems] .

A|59| A: Uh-huh . 
B|60| M: Uhhhh [, [I] think] . 
A|61| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|62| M: It's _like_ _you know [,_ uh ,] _where_ [the] women [are] [from] . 
A|63| A: Uh-huh . _It_ [was] amazing [I] [went to] [the] Far East [, uh ,] back [in] October [to] do _some_ training for T [I] [and] [I] , 
B|64| M: uhh . [uh .] 
A|65| A: [uh ,] _some_ [of] those countries _were_ so _safe_ , it [was] unreal . Singapore [is] [very] , supposed [to be] [very] _safe_ [and] , [in] fact , Tokyo [, and] [I] thought Tokyo would [be] dangerous [being] such [a] huge large city [with] so many _people_ , 
B|66| M: Ughuh 
A|67| A: [but] [they] , [at] , [at] [the] T [I] _there_ [, I] said [is] _there_ any area [I] _should_ avoid [. And] [the] guy said let me ask [another] girl _here_ [and] [he] turned [and] asked [this] girl [, and] said , _can_ [you] [think] [of] any [place] [where] Dana shouldn't go by herself , or anything [. And] _she_ , _she_ thought for [a] _few_ minutes [and] _she_ said [, no [.] And] [he] said [is] _there_ any [place] [you] wouldn't go by yourself . She said [, no [.] And] [they] said , it [is] so _safe_ _there_ [that] [you] _can_ leave your purse [on] [the] subway 
B|68| M: [she] ? 
A|69| A: [and] somebody will turn it [in] [and] [, and] nothing will [be] missing [. They] said [they] _can_ [just] [about] guarantee [that] _there_ [, that] [, that] would happen [if] [you] did [that] . [I] thought , boy , [in] America , [if] [you] left [a] purse [on] [a] subway _, you_ would never see it again . 
B|70| M:  ... 
A|71| A: Yeah [, that's] [true ,] 
B|72| M: i 
A|73| A: [that's] [true] . [But] [I was] thinking boy , [in] [Dallas] , [if] somebody asked me [if] _there_ _were_ _places_ [you] wouldn't go by yourself [at] night , I'd [have] [to] set _them_ down for [about] five or ten minutes [to] list [all] [the] _places_ [out .] 
B|74| M: [It] . 
A|75| A: _I mean [,_ I] couldn't believe [that] [she] couldn't [think] [of] any [place [.] They] said [, the] , apparently [the] crime , [is] , [just] [, uh ,] 
B|76| M: No [, they] [were] talking [about] [the] crimes . 
A|77| A: [I'm] [not] sure [what] it [is] _there ._ Now [, I] _know what_ it [is] [in] Singapore , [is] [they have] [the] death penalty [and] [they] really enforce it , 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: [like] for drugs , for drugs [they] [, they] enforce [the] death penalty for [that] . [Uh [,] they're just] , [very] , [very] tough [, and] [I] guess maybe [that's] [the way] Tokyo [is] too , or _Japan_ [is] too _. They're_ [just] [very] tough [on] criminals . 
B|80| M: [Japan] 
A|81| A: Uh-huh . 
B|82| M: No [, no] [, no [.] They're] 
A|83| A: Uh-huh . 
B|84| M: That's [uh] [uh [,] it's a] [country] . 
A|85| A: Uh-huh , oh [yeah .]

A|87| A: Uh-huh . 
B|88| M: [I mean [,] uh [,] yeah .] 
A|89| A: Uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [Um] ... [I think] [we] [can] [get] [them] [out] [of] [here] . 
A|91| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|92| M: We're [not] [all] bad [, but] [there] [are] [some] [people] who [deserve to] [get] [out] [of] jail . 
A|93| A: Right [, and] [if] [they're] _overcrowded , well _,_ [you_ know] [they] shouldn't [have] gotten theirself [there] [in] [the] first [place .] 
B|94| M: [And] [if] [they get] [overcrowded , well [,] they] [should] [have] been [put] away . 
A|95| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|96| M:  
A|97| A: Uh-huh . 
B|98| M:  ... 
A|99| A: _Oh_ [, yeah] [, [I] agree] , [because] [it's] [not] _fair_ [to] those [of] us [that] [, that] [deserve] _a safe_ _, [you_ know ,] life [to] [have] [to] , 
B|100| M: It's [a] shame [that] you're [getting] downvoted . 
A|101| A: Right . 
B|102| M: No [, it's] [all] [fair] 
A|103| A: Uh-huh . 
B|104| M: It's okay . I'll give [you] [a safe] 
A|105| A: Uh-huh . 
B|106| M: What [if] [I] told [you] [that] [the] laws [were] harsher ? 
A|107| A: Uh-huh . 
B|108| M: Uuhuh . 
A|109| A: Uh-huh . 
B|110| M: Uhhh [, you] [don't] [know what] [a] joke [is .] 
A|111| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|112| M: [Oh] [no] _, not_ [you] . 
A|113| A: Right [, not] much . 
B|114| M: You pay [them] . 
A|115| A: Yeah , huh-uh [, and] especially [not] [in] [some] [of] these big cities , [like] [in] [Dallas] [I mean] they've [had] [, they're] up [in] [the] top , top five [I think] [of] cities [that] [are] [getting] policeman killed [on] , [on] , [in] [the] line [of] duty [and] [that's] really sad . 
B|116| M: Not [all] [of] [them] . There [are] [a lot of] [places] [where] police [are] [not] [the] most effective . 
A|117| A: Uh-huh . 
B|118| M: A [few] hundred dollars [a] day 
A|119| A: Uh-huh . 
B|120| M: How [are] [they] ?
