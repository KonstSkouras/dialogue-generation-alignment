B|6| M: _I_ meant _that I_ _like_ _it ._ 
A|7| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Needs to be punished or _, uh ,_ eliminated from society . 
B|8| M: Serial murder 
A|9| A: Right . _And then_ _do it_ all over again . Uh-huh . 
B|10| M: [And _then] the_ police _would_ _just_ [do it] _in prison_ . 
A|11| A: Right . Have to agree with you , [and] _I'm_ kind [of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also . [I] [just] _don't_ [think] [that] [it] acts much as [a] deterrent to these people because _, uh ,_ you still see them committing [the] same crimes _, but_ [, I] tend to agree with you [that] _, uh ,_ we should have [it] [I] [just] _, I don't know_ [that] _it's_ always effective _but I_ guess we _, uh ,_ we're kind [of] stuck with [it .] It's , _it's a_ difficult _, uh ,_ problem , isn't [it] , to determine how [you're] going to punish somebody for [a] particular crime _, uh ,_ 
B|12| M:  
A|13| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Right , uh-huh . 
B|14| M:  
A|15| A: Uh-huh , huh . Do you [think] they should be punished at all , or _, uh ,_ [like] go to [prison] _, uh ,_ because they're not really [a] danger to society . It was almost really self defense , isn't [it] , [in] [a] case [like] [that] . 
B|16| M: _I ,_ 
A|17| A: Uh-huh . 
B|18| M: Uuhuhuh . Uuhuhuuhuh 
A|19| A: [I] _know_ they put _, uh ,_ put them [in] jail sometimes [, I] guess . _Uh ,_ 
B|20| M: _You_ [don't] understand . 
A|21| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Um . Uh-huh . [You] _know ,_ now [, I] wonder what you [think] about this [and] _, uh ,_ unfortunately , we , we [don't] get to [do it] _, but_ _, uh ,_ [it] used to be [a] long time ago [, I] guess [in] Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something , for example , to your family , [then] you had [the] right to administer [the] punishment .

B|22| M:  
A|23| A: Right . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| A: Might make you feel better _but_ 
B|26| M: i 
A|27| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|28| M: Well [, I don't [know] [,] I] [think] [it's a] possibility 
A|29| A: Uh-huh . Right . Uh-huh . Right , because they're [a] danger to everybody else . Huh , [that's] interesting . [I] have to _, uh_ agree with [that] . 
B|30| M: Yeah [, [but] I] [think] [it's] [just] [the] most likely scenario . 
A|31| A: There's [a] lot [of] folks , probably , [that] are [in prison] [that] _, uh ,_ [that] aren't really [a] danger to society , huh , [and] _, uh ,_ 
B|32| M: [Uh [,] uh _,] I don't [,_ uh] ... 
A|33| A: Right . Right , probably more [of] them [then the] other way around Interesting . [I don't [,] I don't ,] not sure [I ,] _I'm_ [in] Washington , D C or at least very close to [it .] _I'm_ not sure what kind [of] [, uh ,] capital punishment we have here .
