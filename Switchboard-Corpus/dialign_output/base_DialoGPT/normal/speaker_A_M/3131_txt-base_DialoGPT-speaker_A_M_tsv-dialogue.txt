B|58| M: [you] mean [they] don t get outta [the] house ? 
A|59| A: [You know] once [you] make [that] step [you] [know] [that] [it's just] going _to_ [be] downhill [from] then on [and] [, and] I've [seen people] really fight _it_ [that] desperately needed _to_ make [the] change . 
B|60| M: [Oh] [. I] _thought_ [it was] [a] new thing . 
A|61| A: _They_ , [they] became [, in] fact , [that's] probably what's going _to_ happen with my husband's mother .
