B|42| M:  
A|43| A: [and [,] uh ,] but he will [, uh ,] he'll flip around , [I] think [the] other [night] we had _on [, uh [,_ uh] ,] [it] was [a] , [it] was car races , some kind [of] car races where [they] were bumping over hills [and] flying into [the] air [and] coming down . [I] don't [know] [what] channel he found [that] _on_ 
B|44| M: i 
A|45| A: [and [,] uh ,] but he will turn [that] _on ,_ especially for , if , again , if our [, uh ,] oldest grandson is over here . He's ten 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: [and [,] uh [,] they'll] find something [like] [that] [and] just absolutely sit glued [to] [it] , [I] [, you] [know ,] [I] keep telling them it's [the] same mentality [you] [know [,] and] something's wrong [, and [,] uh ,] but [, uh [,] and] we very seldom [watch] television _on_ [a] Friday [night] or Saturday [night] , because we're [not] home 
B|48| M: [Yes ,] 
A|49| A: [and [,] uh ,] so [, and] Sundays [, uh ,] we usually have , [all] [of] our _kids_ [are] over _on_ Sunday , so [, you] [know ,] we don't [get] into [that] , except [that] sometimes we'll [get] into [their] home videos

A|55| A: _that are_ sometimes so dumb 
B|56| M: [I like] [the] ones [that are] [the] ones [with] [the] funny music
