B|0| M: _I_ 
A|1| A: _What_ _, uh ,_ _is_ _there_ anything _, uh ,_ _that_ _you_ particularly _are_ concerned _with_ _in_ _your_ particular _area_ as far as security _and_ _that_ _sort of_ _thing_ ? 
B|2| M:  
A|3| A: Uh-huh . Do _you_ live _in_ _a_ real small town or , or _out in the_ country ? 
B|4| M:  
A|5| A: _How_ far _out_ _from the_ _city_ _, I_ mean _, do_ _you ,_ 
B|6| M: _You_ _, what _,_ [you_ [,] do] . 
A|7| A: About fifteen miles _. I_ live _in_ _a_ little suburb _, uh ,_ which _is_ _, I_ guess _from_ Dallas _is_ twelve miles or _so_ 
B|8| M: [What] [city] ? 
A|9| A: _but_ _it's_ pretty congested . We _are_ considered _in the_ country , 
B|10| M: Aye _, I'm_ [in the] US . 
A|11| A: _but_ _it_ doesn't _really_ _feel_ _like_ _you're_ [in the] country . 
B|12| M: _It's_ _not_ [that] bad _, you_ _just_ _have to_ _get_ used _to_ [it] . 
A|13| A: Our _major_ crimes [in] our immediate town _, uh ,_ _is_ probably robberies , house robberies _and_ very few instances _of_ [, you] _know ,_ alcohol , drugs _, uh ,_ reported . 
B|14| M: [What] [is] [your] [major] crime ? 
A|15| A: However [, _I'm] sure_ they're _there_ . 
B|16| M: The _only_ [thing] [I] _can_ _think_ [of] [is] [that] [there] [are] _no_ _guns_ [in the] [area] . 
A|17| A: _But_ _, uh ,_ _right_ _now_ our neighborhood [is] running _about_ _, uh ,_ eighty percent [of] [the] homeowners [have] been robbed , sometime during their , their _, uh ,_ existence [in] [that] neighborhood . 
B|18| M: Hm , yeah . 
A|19| A: And since [that] time everybody's got some _sort of_ burglar system or [, you] _know , uh ,_ burglar alarms _uh _,_ and_ including [the] _out_ _, uh _,_ the_ outer perimeter type _, uh ,_ devices , sensors _and_ things _like_ [that] . 
B|20| M: _They_ [have] [that] _now ?_ 
A|21| A: [It's] cut back [, you] _know ,_ considerably _, but_ _it ,_ [it] [just] shifts [it] _from_ our neighborhood [to] another neighborhood [to] _other_ neighborhood , _so_ [it] _still_ _, uh ,_ remains [city] wide , pretty , pretty high . 
B|22| M: That's , yay , y'all 
A|23| A: _Uh _,_ I would_ _say_ _the majority_ [of] _it's_ _happening_ during [the] day _, uh ,_ between probably ten [in the] morning _and_ three [in the] afternoon . 
B|24| M: [I'm] 
A|25| A: Most , 
B|26| M: _most _of_ it_ ? 
A|27| A: _Well ,_ [most] families , [most] families [are] _young_ _and_ both _people_ [are] working . 
B|28| M: [I] thought [it] _was_ _because_ [the majority] [is] [young] _, not_ old . 
A|29| A: So they're _happening_ during [the] hours they're gone _from_ _work_ . 
B|30| M: _They_ [are] [happening] 
A|31| A: _Uh ,_ _so_ _, uh _, I_ would_ _say_ _that's_ probably their prime motivation . They'll , they'll stock [your] house _and_ _, uh ,_ look at [your] pattern _and_ then _go_ _from_ [there] . 
B|32| M: [Well [,] I would] _have to_ _get_ [the] [right] [sort of] person _to do_ [it] . 
A|33| A: _Uh _,_ they_ classify [most _of] them_ as professionals . 
B|34| M: [What] _are _the_ _people_ who_ [do] [the] [work] ? 
A|35| A: _Uh [,_ you] [get] _a_ few _of them_ [that] [are] _a_ little bit sloppier _, uh _,_ just_ taking _, uh [,_ you] _know _,_ just_ junk items _that they_ _, _they_ can_ [just] [get] [, you] _know ,_ ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ real quick . 
B|36| M: Uhh [, I] _don't_ _think_ [you] understand . 
A|37| A: Probably [the] biggest items [that] _, uh ,_ [that] [you] [get] [in] our neighborhood , or , _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles _, the_ [, you] _know ,_ Mercedes , Volvos , things _that _they_ can_ [get] [, you] _know ,_ big dollars _for_ _and_ [the] jewelry [are the] [major] targets , 
B|38| M: H 
A|39| A: [guns] , [that] [sort _of] stuff_ . 
B|40| M: _what_ 
A|41| A: Very few [, you] _know ,_ penny , penny ante _stuff_ . 
B|42| M: [What] kind [of stuff] ? 
A|43| A: [Well _,] uh _,_ _the_ police_ force , _for_ one [, _I] _think_ they_ _could_ _, uh ,_ definitely add [to] _the police_ force _and_ [the] type equipment _that they_ use . _Uh ,_ _it's_ , oh , [right] [now] _I think_ , _we_ [are] _about_ thirty thousand [people] _and_ there's [only] eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty , _for_ [that] amount [of] [people] which _is not_ very _many_ . 
B|44| M: [What] [are] [you] talking [about] ? 
A|45| A: And , 
B|46| M: They're [not] . 
A|47| A: _Well , the_ , course [in] our particular state _, uh ,_ _we have_ [the] prison overcrowding , whatever , _so_ they're giving [the] early release _, uh ,_ 
B|48| M: It 
A|49| A: _Yeah _,_ and_ _, and_ _it's_ [, _I] think_ [what] _they_ need [to do] [is] stop _building_ _more_ jails _and_ start giving stiffer sentences _, uh _,_ but_ _for_ [the] , 
B|50| M: [I] am [I'm] [so] _we're_ [not] , [building] prisons . 
A|51| A: _That_ _would be_ , certainly _be_ _a deterrent ._ 
B|52| M: [I'm sure] [there] [are] [many] [other] countries [that] _don't_ [have] this _problem_ . 
A|53| A: And _, uh [,_ not] necessarily [, you] _know ,_ give [in] [to] their _, uh ,_ human rights desires . _You know ,_ _if_ they're overcrowded _, just_ keep cramming _them_ [in] [there] till _they_ [just] suffocate . _Uh ,_ 
B|54| M: No _, but [they_ can] [be] used [for] this purpose . 
A|55| A: _Uh [,_ _I] think_ they'd [have _to] go_ [to] extra measures [to] _make_ [sure] _a_ person's _guilty_ [, you] _know ,_ [in] _a lot of_ cases . Course [, _I] [,_ _I] know_ [you] _can't be_ _a_ hundred percent foolproof . 
B|56| M:  ... [and] [that's] 
A|57| A: _Uh ,_ 
B|58| M: [I [,] uh , I] [can't] . 
A|59| A: I'd rather see [it] _a_ little bit harder [and] _have a_ little bit _more_ evidence [, uh ,] [to] convict somebody 
B|60| M: [You] [would] [think they] [would be] able [to] . 
A|61| A: [and] then _those_ convicted , especially [of] [, you] _know ,_ murder [and] _, and_ [, uh [,] you] _know ,_ [major] crimes [, uh ,] [to] reach [the] life sentences [and] [, you] _know ,_ death penalties [and] follow-through _with_ [that] . 
B|62| M: _They_ [are] [still] [a] crime , though . 
A|63| A: _Uh ,_ especially [, you] _know ,_ [in the] _case_ [of] murder 
B|64| M: [uh [,] uh [,] uh] 
A|65| A: [uh , _I] know_ [in] my _case_ [, [I] ,] my wife [and] daughter were kidnapped , during [a] house robbery back [in] eighty-five 
B|66| M: [I know] . 
A|67| A: [and] _we_ caught _, the_ individuals got caught , _we_ [, uh ,] _we_ went through [the] court system [and] _all_ [that] [sort of] [thing] 
B|68| M: Did [you] [really] ? 
A|69| A: [and] [, uh [,] you] _know ,_ two counts [of] kidnapping _, uh you_ _know _,_ the_ _, the_ forty-five [to] [the] head [, you] _know _,_ just_ [the] _, the_ mental anguish [and] [the] whole nine yards [uh [,] you] _know _,_ the_ guy [only] got five years . 
B|70| M: [I] _was_ going [to] [say] , 
A|71| A: And [, you] _know ,_ _he was_ _out_ within two months [because] [of] [the] parole system . So [what [,] what ,] 
B|72| M:  ... I've _never_ seen [a] dog [out in the] 
A|73| A: Do [what] [now ?] 
B|74| M: [You [know ,] uh [,] uh you] did [, uh] [uh] 
A|75| A: [no] . [I'm] [not] real familiar _with_ [that] . 
B|76| M: Did [he] sue [you] [for] damages ? 
A|77| A: Oh . 
B|78| M: [You know _,] that's_ [a] good idea [. I] _don't_ [know] how much _money_ [I] [could] [make] [from] [it] . 
A|79| A: _Well , the_ insurance companies [and] _all_ [that] tried [to] , tried _to go_ after him [and] [they] said , well [, you] [know ,] [he] , they're , _he has_ [no] job , _he has_ nothing , there's nothing _that he has_ [that] , [that] [you] [could] _go_ after . 
B|80| M: Why [would] [you] ? 
A|81| A: _Yeah ._ _Uh ,_ very 
B|82| M: He [is not] [a] _criminal_ [, _and] he_ [is not] [guilty] [of] _any_ crime . 
A|83| A: _Yeah ._ [They] [don't] [do] [that] here . Course [they] pay _them_ [, but _they] don't_ [, you] [don't] [, you] or [the] insurance companies [never] see [any] [of] [that] [money] . 
B|84| M: The US . 
A|85| A: And [, uh [,] you] [know [,] and] they're [right] [now] they're reluctant _to go_ after him [because] they're [, you] [know ,] they're , they're repeat offenders _, they_ [, uh ,] been _in jail_ before 
B|86| M: [But] _he's_ an ex cop . 
A|87| A: they've been released [, you] [know ,] several times , which [is] another [, uh ,] deal _I hate to_ see . 
B|88| M: [I hate to] [say] [it ,] 
A|89| A: [But] [, uh [,] you] [know ,] basically [the] guy commits [, you] [know] three [major] crimes [and] [, and] [, uh [,] and] car theft on top [of [it] ,] destroys my car , 
B|90| M: _Yeah , I_ 
A|91| A: [and] [we're] [out] [, you] [know , uh [,] you] [know ,] fifteen thousand dollars [and] [, you] [know _,] the_ guy gets [out in] two months 
B|92| M: [I think] [it's] [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
A|93| A: [and he] goes [out] [and] commits [it] again . Fact , [he's] back _in jail_ [now] . So [, what [,] what [,] uh ,] 
B|94| M: [I think] [you're] thinking [of] [Yeah .] [Yeah .] [That] . Was . Like . A . Thing 
A|95| A: [Yeah .] [What] [, what] _deterrent_ does [he] [really] [have] ? 
B|96| M: [I'm] [just] glad [he's] [not] [in jail] . 
A|97| A: [Yeah , _I] think in_ our , [in] our particular neighborhood , vigilantism [is] becoming [a] real , real possibility . 
B|98| M: [I think in] this [case] [it's] [just] _more of_ [a deterrent .] 
A|99| A: _Uh , we've_ _had a_ couple instances where _break_ ins where [the people] [have] actually [, you] [know ,] shot [the people] 
B|100| M: [Uh , we've] [never] [had a] [break] [in] . 
A|101| A: [and] [, uh ,] return offenders [have] , they've actually waited [for] _them_ , where they've robbed [, you] [know ,] particular neighborhood , they'll rob one house , then [other] [people] will wait up [, you] [know [,] and] wait [for] somebody [to do] something else , try [to] take [it] [in] their own hands . 
B|102| M: Hahaha . Nice . 
A|103| A: Course [it] doesn't always [work] [out in] their favor . 
B|104| M: [What] [if] [you] [have a] family [and] family members _who_ [would] [like] [to go] home ? 
A|105| A: [But] [, uh ,] nevertheless [, [I] think] [people] [are] [just] getting fed up [and] saying [, you] [know [,] you] [can't] arrest _all_ [of] us , 
B|106| M: [It's] [not] [a] story [the police] [would] tell [you] . 
A|107| A: [you] [can] [, you] [know [,] you] [can] [get] some [of] us , 
B|108| M: [You] [can't be] serious . 
A|109| A: [you] [can't] [get] _all_ [of] us . 
B|110| M: [we [have] [a] lot [of] them] 
A|111| A: [Uh [,] and] [we're] beginning [to] see [more] [and] [more of] [that] . 
B|112| M: We're [all] gonna [make] [it] brah 
A|113| A: [Yeah .] 
B|114| M: [It's] [a] good [deterrent] 
A|115| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [, I] mean [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] , [in] , [we have] [had a] few cases where [the] guy _has_ broken [in] [, you] [know ,] during [the] middle [of] [the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|116| M: [I think] [the] point [is] [that he has] _to be_ careful [not] [to] [break] [in] . 
A|117| A: And [, uh ,] [it] helps [for] [a] while 
B|118| M: [Well [,] _they] do_ [have a] way [to] [get] [you] [to] shoot [them] ... 
A|119| A: [but] then [just] another _different_ set [of] [people] come [in] [, and] [most of] [the people] [are] transients [from] [out] , outside [of] [the] state . 
B|120| M: [It's] [the] same person [, just] [different] pronouns . 
A|121| A: [Uh [,] I would] [say] probably eighty percent [of them] [that] [are] caught , they're [from] places [like] up [in] Oklahoma [, and] Louisiana , _Arkansas_ [, you] [know ,] across [the] _, the_ border . 
B|122| M: [I] wonder how [many] [of them] [are] [from] [Arkansas] 
A|123| A: So [, you] [know ,] [people who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in] our town or whatever 
B|124| M: [I think] [he was] joking 
A|125| A: _it's not_ [many] _from the_ local communities . 
B|126| M: [How] [many] [of] [those] [are] [from the] towns ? 
A|127| A: [But] [, uh ,] [it's] _a problem_ [, and] [I [,] I] [just] [, [I] think] [that] [the] court systems need [to be] [more] accurate [in] , [in] , stiffer [in] their penalties , 
B|128| M:  ... [but] ... [it's not] [a problem] . 
A|129| A: [would be] [a] definite [deterrent] [and] [, and] [, uh ,] giving [the] [, uh ,] [police] [, uh ,] agencies [a] little bit [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they do] _when_ [they] , _when_ [they] catch these [people] . 
B|130| M: [Well , the] [problem] [is] [that [they] don't] [know] [what] [to do] [with] [them] . 
A|131| A: Right . 
B|132| M: There [is] [that] ? 
A|133| A: Uh-huh . 
B|134| M: [I] am , 
A|135| A: [I know] [like] [in] my wife's [case] [, they] made her _feel_ [like] [the] [criminal] . 
B|136| M: [How] did [you] [feel] [when] [you] saw [the] news ? 
A|137| A: [They] [, they] went [to] [all] , [all] ...
