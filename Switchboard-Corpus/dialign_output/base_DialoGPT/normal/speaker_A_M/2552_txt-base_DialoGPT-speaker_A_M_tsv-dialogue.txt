B|2| M:  
A|3| A: _And_ _so_ _I think_ , um _, it's_ become real important _to_ me _that_ _we_ try _to_ spend _time_ together _as_ _a_ _family_ . So there's _one_ _or_ _two_ nights _a_ week , _we_ _have_ _a_ , on Monday nights _we_ set aside _time_ where _it's_ called _, uh _,_ family_ home evening _and_ _we_ stay home _that_ evening , all _of_ us _, and_ _we_ _do_ things together . 
B|4| M: _no_

B|12| M: _We_ _can [do_ a] night's 
A|13| A: _Right_ _, and_ _then_ , you _know ,_ sometimes _we_ try _to_ [do] our lesson on Sunday night _and_ _then_ our activity _or_ _something_ on Monday _but_ , We're _, it's_ real important _to_ us _to_ spend _time_ together . 
B|14| M: _It's_ . Not . 
A|15| A: _I have two ._ 
B|16| M: I'm sorry . I'm sorry I'm [so] sorry . 
A|17| A: Uh-huh . _I have_ [a] _girl_ _and_ [a] boy _, and_ _the_ boy's five _, he's_ _in_ kindergarten _, and_ _the_ _girl_ is four . She'll _be_ _in_ kindergarten next year . Uh-huh . 
B|18| M: I'll [be] her friend .

A|23| A: Uh-huh . 
B|24| M: _Well_ [uh _,] I have_ _no_ [kids] . 
A|25| A: Uh-huh .

B|34| M:  
A|35| A: _and_ _they_ , everybody decided _to_ come over _and_ talk _to_ me _right_ now . But [, uh _,] it's_ , yeah . 
B|36| M: [I think] they're [just [not] as] funny [as] [they] used [to] [be] . 
A|37| A: [Well] _, it's_ also important [, [I] think] , um , for [my] husband . _I [,_ I] try _to go_ out [of] [my] way [to] _, to_ plan things [that] _he_ [can do] _with_ _the_ [kids] because , since [I] am home _with_ them _and_ [so] [I] get [a lot of] [time] _with_ them _, he_ needs [to] [have] , um , some [time] _with_ them . 
B|38| M: [Yes .] 
A|39| A: So _he ,_ when _he_ comes home _, _he_ ,_ um , you _know _,_ it's_ his job at night . _He_ puts _the_ [kids] [to] bed , 
B|40| M: I'm ahem . 
A|41| A: _and_ _he_ reads [to] them , 
B|42| M: [he] sits down [, and] [I] sit down 
A|43| A: [and] _he spends_ [about] an hour doing [that] [, and] that's , that's pretty good quality [time] _, with_ them , 
B|44| M: [I] _don't_ [know _,] but_ [he spends] hours reading , 
A|45| A: _and ,_ um _, but it's_ hard for him on Saturdays . _He _,_ he wants ,_ _Right_ _, he wants_ [to] run out [and] get things done , 
B|46| M: [He] has [to] [be] [, he's] [a lot of] fun [to] watch . 
A|47| A: [and] [so] , um [, I] try [to] say , _well ,_ why [don't] you _go fly_ kites _or_ why [don't] you _do something ._ 
B|48| M: [I [,] uh ,] [don't] [think] [he's] gonna [, he's] [, uh] ... [not] [a] guy . 
A|49| A: _And_ if [I have] _something_ _in_ mind , _then he , he_ remembers [that] , that's what _he wants_ [to] [do] . 
B|50| M:  ... [And] [then he [, he] wants [,] [to] [go] fly] [, and] [do something .] 
A|51| A: Uh-huh . 
B|52| M: [I think] 
A|53| A: Uh-huh . 
B|54| M: What's _your_ wife ? 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [They] _had_ [a] fun [time] running around [and] playing . 
A|57| A: [Yes .] 
B|58| M: Are [they] happy [with] _your_ decision ? 
A|59| A: Uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [And] [we] did [they] [have] [kids] ? 
A|61| A: [Well] , that's _right ._ But [I] [do] [think] , um , you [know ,] _like_ _the_ current trends [are] [that] , um , _the_ _family_ unit is devaluated . [It's] [not] nearly [as] important . 
B|62| M: _You_ . 
A|63| A: [We] find [that] , you [know ,] _back_ [just] even fifty years ago when people [had] financial problems , _the_ first place [they] went [to] was their _family_ . 
B|64| M: [I think] . 
A|65| A: [And] _families_ took care [of] themselves _and ,_ um [, but] now , you [know ,] people _don't ,_ [they] [don't] support each other [that] way . 
B|66| M: The [family] [, family] , [families] . 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| M: [I] [know] [right] ? 
A|69| A: _That's_ [right] _and ,_ 
B|70| M: That _and , and_ 
A|71| A: _Right_ _, right_ , 
B|72| M: [I] [don't [,] but] I'm [right .] 
A|73| A: [And] _it's not_ an easy sacrifice for [a] person [to] make , because , you [know [,] [I] ,] you [know [,] I have] interests [that] , too , 
B|74| M: I'm [not [,] but] I'm [the] [one] who's asking . 
A|75| A: [and] _it_ is hard [to] make [, uh ,] those interests [not] [be] [as] [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|76| M: _No_ [, [right] .] 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . 
B|78| M: [Oh] . _Right ._ 
A|79| A: Uh-huh . 
B|80| M: _Yeah [,_ uh] . 
A|81| A: [Right .] 
B|82| M: [I think] . 
A|83| A: It is _temporary ._ It , _in the_ middle [of] _it_ , _it_ seems _like_ _a long_ [time] , 
B|84| M: [It's] 
A|85| A: [but] you're [right] , _it_ is _temporary ._ [Well] [, I] see [that] [we] both share _the same_ belief here _that it's_ important [that] [we] spend [time] [with] our [kids] 
B|86| M: _That's true_ [, but it's] still [temporary .] 
A|87| A: [and , [and] ,] _in_ spite [of] , 
B|88| M: [They are] [in [the] same] house . 
A|89| A: Uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [well [,] it's] [a long] shot [, but it's] always [the] best idea . 
A|91| A: [Yes .] 
B|92| M: Do [they] [have] any children ? 
A|93| A: [That's true] . 
B|94| M: _I've_ never heard [of] [a] single [girl] having [a] son [or] daughter . 
A|95| A: Uh-huh . 
B|96| M: [I] [know] I'm [just not] sure [about] 
A|97| A: [Yeah] . 
B|98| M: [He ,] [just] [, with] . 
A|99| A: [Well] , _it_ is , [the] hardest thing [I've] [ever] done , [as] much [as] you'd [go] out 
B|100| M: [Oh] [I] [know ,] I'm [just] saying [that [it's] not as] bad [as] [I] [thought] [it] [would] [be] . 
A|101| A: [and ,] 
B|102| M: I'm sorry [, but] ... 
A|103| A: Uh-huh . 
B|104| M: _Yeah ,_ [my] wife [, uh ,] likes [that] . 
A|105| A: Uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [uh ,] she works [in the] bathroom . 
A|107| A: [Well] , that's good . 
B|108| M: I'm [not] going [to] lie . She's [not] going [back] [to] work . 
A|109| A: Uh-huh . 
B|110| M: [Oh [,] uh ,] what's [the] deal [with] [that] ? 
A|111| A: [No] . [Yeah [,] [I] think] [so] . [I think] [it's] an investment [in] [your] future , even if [it's] purely [not ,] [not] religious . [You] [can] at least say [that it's] important [to] our country , [that] our [family] unit stays strong . 
B|112| M: [Yes .]
