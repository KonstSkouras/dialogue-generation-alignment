A|1| A: Um _, you know ,_ different things _, is it_ restricted _to_ certain crimes ? Or _just ,_ 
B|2| M: That's _a_ _very_ interesting idea . 
A|3| A: Uh-huh . Um . _Well_ . 
B|4| M: _But_ _, _but_ _,_ but_ ... 
A|5| A: _Yes _,_ _I_ _know_ , the_ one thing _that [I_ think] _is_ _really_ _sad_ _about [it_ ,] as [I] recall , _from_ [the] articles _that_ _I've_ read _, is_ _that_ _if_ _, if_ _people_ who _have been_ _there_ , _are going to be_ killed . Um , there's _people that_ come _to the_ prisons _and_ they're [very] violent _and_ _, they_ want _, _I_ mean_ they're anxious _for_ someone _to be_ killed 
B|6| M: What ? 
A|7| A: _I _just_ , [I_ can't] see _that ._ 
B|8| M: _So_ _what_ [you] 
A|9| A: Uh-huh . 
B|10| M: Hehuh . 
A|11| A: _No_ . 
B|12| M: What _do you_ [mean] ? 
A|13| A: _Well ,_ _there_ _is_ _so_ many chances _for_ _appeal_ , _that_ [it] 
B|14| M: _I don't_ [think] [there] 
A|15| A: _it's_ _really_ _sad ._ 
B|16| M: _But_ _does_ [it's] [sad .] 
A|17| A: _I don't _know_ _,_ I just_ [think] , um , somehow [I] hoped _that_ as [a] _people_ _we_ could _be_ _better_ _than_ , _than_ , um , expecting _, the_ feeling _that_ [it] 
B|18| M: Why ? _It's_ [a] [very] _good_ movie _, it's a_ great movie _, and_ _it's not_ _like_ [it's] [going to] _get_ [better] . 
A|19| A: _with_ , someone _is_ calling _for_ someone else _to be_ killed _, you _know_ ._ Is _really_ kind [of] bad 
B|20| M: [I] am . 
A|21| A: [and] [there] _really_ _are_ criminals _that_ _are_ hard-core [and] , repeat [, and] never _have any_ chance _for_ , 
B|22| M: no . 
A|23| A: _Oh _,_ _I don't_ _know_ _,_ is [it_ ,] [do you] _feel_ at all _like [,_ it's a] religious issue ? 
B|24| M: How [is it] [really] ? 
A|25| A: Uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [Well _,] that's_ [the] only reason [I've] ever _had_ [to] use _it ._ 
A|27| A: Um . 
B|28| M: [Oh [,] is it] ? 
A|29| A: _I don't _know_ ,_ sometimes [I] _feel_ _, _I_ mean_ [I] [do] _go to_ church [and] things _. I _don't know_ how_ _I would_ _feel about it _._ But_ [like] [you] say _, if_ [it] hit [you] personally , closer at home _you would_ _feel_ , _feel_ differently . 
B|30| M: Why ? How ? 
A|31| A: _Do you think_ most states _have_ _that_ or ? 
B|32| M: I'm _not_ _sure_ [. I don't [know] .] 
A|33| A: That _still_ [does] [it [,] that's] _right ._ 
B|34| M: _You_ 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . 
B|36| M: _No [,_ it's a] felony . 
A|37| A: Have _that ._ [Well [,] and] [it] doesn't seem [like] [very] many _people_ _, uh ,_ _are_ _really _,_ _I_ mean ,_ there's _a lot _of_ people that_ _are_ on death row _. But_ there's [not] [very] many _people that_ actually , um . [do] [get] killed . 
B|38| M: I'm 
A|39| A: Uh-huh . [So] , [it] seems [like] [a] _of people_ live [there] [, and] then through appeals . 
B|40| M: [Yes ,] [of] , [have] 
A|41| A: _Because_ _I know_ _they_ [do] frequently _, _I_ mean_ _they_ cover , cover [it] _pretty_ heavily on television [and] [the] newspaper . 
B|42| M: Why ? 
A|43| A: _If_ [it] finally gets [to] _that_ point . 
B|44| M: [Do you think] they'll ever _stop_ ? 
A|45| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|46| M: [So] [the] [appeal] [is] [for] [a] while ? 
A|47| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . [So] [is [it] _,] uh ,_ _are_ _we_ doing lethal injection _now_ ? 
B|48| M: _And_ _the jury_ _will_ _decide_ [that .] 
A|49| A: Uh-huh , which seems _so_ awful . 
B|50| M: _It's_ [a] long story . 
A|51| A: [So] [, it's a] _little_ _bit more_ humane _, I_ guess , [it] [is] , 
B|52| M: [Yeah] [, uh ,] no . 
A|53| A: [Yes _,] _the_ other_ one _just_ seems _so_ terrible . 
B|54| M: [Well [,] it's] [still] [a] [bit more] painful [than] [the other] . 
A|55| A: Um . 
B|56| M: _No [, I_ don't] [think] [so] 
A|57| A: [Well ,] [do [you] think] [that] _we_ [do] [it] _because we_ want [it] [to] deter _crime_ or [, [it's] not] _because _we_ don't_ want [to] pay [for] inmates [to] stay _in_ prison ? 
B|58| M: [Yes [,] it's] [because we] [are] paying [for] them . 
A|59| A: Uh-huh . 
B|60| M: That's _what_ [they] said _, but_ [it's] [because] [they] [don't] _have a_ problem 
A|61| A: Um . 
B|62| M: What [do you] [mean] ? 
A|63| A: _Yes ._ 
B|64| M: [So] [are] [you] saying [that] [they] [are going to be] rehabilitated ? 
A|65| A: Um . [Well ,] um [, and] [I] notice [that] _the crime_ rate [was] _up_ _in the_ _Dallas_ _area_ [It's] , [It's] kind [of] _been_ scary , [to] [think] _about it_ 
B|66| M: Not [in the] [area] I'm [in] . 
A|67| A: [and] , [And] you're hoping [there] [is] something [that] [will] cut _down_ on [that .] 
B|68| M: [Yes [.] But] . [Yes .] It . [is] . [up] . [to] . [now] . [If] [. But] [, [the] crime] [is] [down] . 
A|69| A: [You] _hate to_ [have] [the] dubious honor [of] being _, you know _,_ so_ high [in the] , [in] statistics , 
B|70| M: _I _hate_ to be_ [that] guy _, but_ what's [the] story [with] [the] number [of] murders [in] [Dallas] ? 
A|71| A: [But] [I] _, you know _,_ _we_ _have_ _been_ _really_ fortunate_ our family , hasn't [had] _any_ [crime] . 
B|72| M: [It's] _not [that_ [I] don't] [have any] pride [in] my country [, I just] [don't know how] [to] [feel about it .] 
A|73| A: [And] _, so_ _we don't_ [, it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor _people that_ [have] suffered [that] way . 
B|74| M: I'm [not] _sure_ _, but [I_ know] [we _have] [,_ so] we've [been [really] ,] [really fortunate] . 
A|75| A: [And] [how] [they] _would_ expect , [how] [they] _would_ hope , 
B|76| M: They wouldn't , they'd _have [,_ you [know ,] the] best [of] intentions . 
A|77| A: _I mean_ [you] [, you] hear _of people_ who [have ,] um , committed crimes [, and] then [they] [get] out [of] jail [and] [they] _go_ [, and] [they] [do] [the] same thing again . 
B|78| M: [Because] [the] world [is] full [of people that] [don't know how] _to do_ [that .] 
A|79| A: [And] [you] wonder _why_ [they] [can't] [just] [stop] [it .] 
B|80| M: They _have a_ law [to] prevent [it] [from] happening . 
A|81| A: [So] , maybe _you would_ , 
B|82| M: [I] wouldn't 
A|83| A: [but] [still] _I would_ [hate to be] on [the jury] [that] sentenced someone . 
B|84| M: I'm [not] [a] judge 
A|85| A: [No , [I] know] when , um _, we_ _just _,_ we_ moved here [, uh [,] I] [from] [the] [, I] got [a] summons , [jury] summons , 
B|86| M: What [do you] [mean [,] [we] [don't] know] ? 
A|87| A: [just] [like] constantly , [it] seemed _like ,_ 
B|88| M: It [was] [like ,] [a lot of] times [, uh ,] times . 
A|89| A: [but] fortunately [I] [had] small children [and] [I] _didn't_ [have] [to] _go_ . 
B|90| M: uhh , yes [, uh] 
A|91| A: [And] [it's [not] that] [, _I] mean [,_ [I] think] everyone should [have] [to] serve on _the jury ,_ 
B|92| M: [Well] yeah [. [I] mean [,] it's] [pretty] much [a] [right .] 
A|93| A: [it's] [just] [that] [, I] _didn't_ [, [I] hate] having [to be] _in charge_ [of] someone else's life . 
B|94| M: [I don't] understand [why] [you] [didn't] [go [to] [the] jury [,] if] [you] did [you would] [have been] [in charge] . 
A|95| A: [And] _I would_ [hate to] [have] [to] hear [any] kind [of] case , involving [a] violent [crime] or anything . 
B|96| M: [I [know] .] [It's] [just [, I] don't] [really] [know] _what_ [the other] guy [was] thinking . 
A|97| A: That _would be_ [really] awful . 
B|98| M: [I [would] be] [so] mad . 
A|99| A: [Well ,] anyway [, I] [sure] [have] enjoyed [, uh ,] talking [to] [you] [about] this . Although [it] has [been] difficult [but [,] uh] . 
B|100| M: [I've] [been] [to] [a] few [of] them [, they] [are] [pretty] _good_ . 
A|101| A: I'd [hate to] [decide] [it , but I] guess [, uh ,] guess [it's] important , [that] [we] [decide] as [a] [people] [what] , [what] we're [going [to] do] . 
B|102| M: What [is it] ? 
A|103| A: Anyway , well [, you] [have a] [good] day . 
B|104| M: A [little] . 
A|105| A: Thank [you] , bye-bye .
