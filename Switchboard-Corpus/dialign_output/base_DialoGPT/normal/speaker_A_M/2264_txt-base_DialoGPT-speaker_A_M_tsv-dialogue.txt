A|7| A: Oh . That's _really_ nice _to_ _know ,_ because _we_ _were_ doing [the] same _thing ._ Because _to_ take _it_ _to_ _a_ Metco _, you_ _have_ _to_ take _it_ when _they're_ open _, you _know_ ,_ which _is_ always _a_ real pain . 
B|8| M: _I'm_ _just_ saying _, you know ._ 
A|9| A: And so when _that_ _thing_ came up [in] Wal-Mart parking lot , _we_ thought , oh , this _is_ great . And _we_ started taking them up _there ._ And then , all [the] sudden , _it_ disappeared [, you know] [I] didn't [know .] And we're _going_ , oh , no , _there_ goes our [recycling] place .

B|14| M: [I] am ? 
A|15| A: Yeah . Yeah . 
B|16| M: [So] _, uh _,_ do_ _we have_ _any_ _other_ food ?

A|23| A: _I know ._ _I know ._ We're kind _of the_ same way . _You know ,_ at first [, you _know] [,_ you] , at first _it_ _was_ _a_ real , _it_ _was_ _a_ real hassle , and [I'm] wondering are [we really] _going to_ [do] this , but [you] kind _of_ get [, I] guess , into _a little_ routine [, you _know] ,_ where _it_ becomes , [is] automatic , now , _to_ throw , different things [in] different places , 
B|24| M:  
A|25| A: [you know .] [So] [I] [just] _go_ [, you _know] ,_ [we have] _a_ pretty _good_ size pantry [in] our kitchen and _I've_ [just] _got_ three trash cans sitting [in] _there_ [, you _know] ,_ [we] [just] kind _of_ dump things [in] each one , if [, you _know] ,_ if [we] get them , 
B|26| M: [You know ,] [got] some . 
A|27| A: so . 
B|28| M: _I mean_ you're , [I'm] [going to] , [I've] been [, [I] know .] 
A|29| A: Oh , they [do] , [too] . And _they're_ impossible [to] crush . [I mean] [, you] can't get [the] down [to] [any] size [, you know .] If [you] get four milk cartons and [that] fills up trash bag [, you know] pretty easily , so . [You know ,] 
B|30| M: [I] 
A|31| A: Oh , [really] . 
B|32| M: _yeah_ , [it's] [a little] less [than] [a] year old . 
A|33| A: Yeah . Yeah . 
B|34| M: [So] [you] [were] [in] [a] car . 
A|35| A: Oh , [that] will _be_ _good_ . 
B|36| M: Just don't [go] 
A|37| A: Sure . Let somebody get something out _of_ _it_ . 
B|38| M: [You] . 
A|39| A: Yeah 
B|40| M: The government won't _give_ [it] away . 
A|41| A: Ha-ha [Well , I] _was_ kind _of_ hoping with [, you [know] [,] do] [you] work for T [I] ? 
B|42| M: _It's_ [a] [good] [thing .] 
A|43| A: No . Yeah . There _was_ [a] , T [I] has [got] this organization called T A D which [is] T I'ers Against Drugs . And [, you [know] ,] we're [recycling] aluminum cans up _here_ and [, uh ,] [just] _what_ [you] would buy out _of the_ machines and drink _here_ and _there_ _was_ crushers out [in] all _of the_ hallways [you [know] ,] and that's , they use [the] money from [that] [to] fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program . [It's] [, you [know] ,] T [I] doesn't [give] them [any] money , all , everything [is] made from [that] . And they had talked about having [a] [thing] like , one Saturday [a] month [, you] could come and drop _your_ aluminum cans off from home [, you [know] ,] 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: And [I'm] kind _of_ like , [yeah] . [I] shall , they would [do] [that] because at least somebody _was_ getting [the] money out _of_ [it] [, you know .] [That] _was_ [going to] use [it] for [good] , so , 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: Sounds like [you] [have] [a little] one [just] like [I] [do] 
B|48| M: [I] . 
A|49| A: Yeah . Mine _was_ two [in] December 
B|50| M: [I] don't [have] [any] [in] [the] bank . 
A|51| A: [Well ,] [it] _was_ [good] [to] talk [to] [you] . 
B|52| M: [I] _hope_ [you] enjoyed [your] time [here] . 
A|53| A: Oh [, do] they [really] . Curbside pick up ? 
B|54| M: My dad [was] [there .] 
A|55| A: [I] [really] [hope] they [do] [that] [in] _Louisville_ . It would make [it] [a] lot easier on all _of_ us . Talk [to] [you] later . 
B|56| M: They're coming [to] [the] [Louisville] area next week . [I'm] not sure [what] part [of the] city [they're] [going to] [be] [in] . 
A|57| A: Bye-bye .
