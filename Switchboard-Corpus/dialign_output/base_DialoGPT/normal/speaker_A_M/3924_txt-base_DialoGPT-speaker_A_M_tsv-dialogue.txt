B|47| M: [So] [it's] [the] [scarier] . 
A|48| A: Yeah [, and] [, uh [,] and then the] people [that] have [it] , [it] does seem [that] _there are_ , [are] some drugs [that] [are] _there_ [that _,] you_ [know] , [they] keep holding back . If [you] , if [I] were dying , I'm [not] sure [I] would care .
