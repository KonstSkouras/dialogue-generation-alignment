B|40| M: Ugh . Ugh . [Uh] 
A|41| A: [Yeah] . I've heard of [a] couple of companies [that] [have] done [that] . [I] think [, uh ,] back about , [a] few years ago when things were tough , Hewlett-Packard did [that] for awhile . They went to [a] [, uh ,] [a] , [a] four and [a] half day work week rather than cut , yeah , just cut everybody back ten percent . And [, uh ,] [have] to , give everybody [a] half day [a] week off . 
B|42| M: Hehehuh
