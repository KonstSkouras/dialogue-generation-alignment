B|38| M: [I think it's a] bit _too_ far . 
A|39| A: _That's_ [how] bad _it was_ . Everything _is_ [just] down everywhere . 
B|40| M: _Oh_ [no] . 
A|41| A: _You _know_ ,_ _we had_ three hundred thousand _people_ without _power_ .

B|46| M: [And] [it's] [already] [been] ... 
A|47| A: [and] _were_ officially , yeah _, and we're_ officially [in] [a] state [of] emergency . Funny _thing_ [is] [the] news _, the_ national news [how] [they] covered _it ._ Uh , 
B|48| M: [I think] [you] _mean_ _they're_ 
A|49| A: [Yeah .] [I think] _it_ made _about_ three minutes on _one_ [of the] national news stations or something [and] _, and_ we've [been] [in] [a] state [of] emergency _for_ over _, you know ,_ _for_ ten or eleven days . 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: _You _know_ ._ _We_ [just] got our phone back today _, uh _,_ and_ _, and_ _, they're_ _you know ,_ putting out ads now _for_ _people_ [to] come volunteer , or [to] [have] their organizations come , volunteer _to help_ clean up [the] streets . 
B|52| M: This [is] awful . 
A|53| A: _Because_ [we] [have] _, you know ,_ everywhere [that] [a] tree [is] down _people_ need _help_ [and] _, we're_ all , all , _a lot of_ older folks need _help_ _getting_ , their yards cleaned out because [they] _can't_ afford [to] pay anyone 
B|54| M:  ... 
A|55| A: _and they_ _, and_ _, and they_ certainly _can't_ carry _it_ themselves 
B|56| M: _You know ?_ 
A|57| A: [and] , So , 
B|58| M: [They] [can't] [, they're] [, you know [,] the] only , other , other ... 
A|59| A: [Oh] , _that's_ great . 
B|60| M: [I'm] _not_ saying [it's] [the] only [thing] [that's] keeping [me] [from] buying [a] _house_ . 
A|61| A: [And] [is that] supported by all donations [to] [the] church [and] so forth or , 
B|62| M: [I] [get] _money_ 
A|63| A: [Oh] , so he , 
B|64| M: [You] [, uh , I'm] pretty sure he's [a] man . 
A|65| A: _That's_ real nice . 
B|66| M: He's _not_ donating _anything_ . 
A|67| A: Right . 
B|68| M: [We] [have] [an] anime page 
A|69| A: _That_ , [that's] real _good_ . 
B|70| M: _Just_ [a] normal [one] . 
A|71| A: [And [I] _,] and_ [I] bet _it_ gives [you] [a] real _good feeling_ _to be_ _doing_ [that] . 
B|72| M: [I'm] [doing] [it] _too_ 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] 
B|74| M: _I mean [,_ it's] [just] [a] bit [of] fun . 
A|75| A: _That's_ , [that's] [, uh ,] [that's] real _good_ . 
B|76| M: It's [just] [a] [good feeling] . 
A|77| A: [We] [had] [, uh ,] [we had] organizations [like] [that] [in] college [, you _know] ._ [We] [had a] community service _group_ [in] college [that] [had] all sorts [of] different groups [and] some did [like] [that] , some did elderly visits , 
B|78| M: _I [know_ .] 
A|79| A: some did [, uh ,] some did [, you know ,] _Big Brother_ , _Big_ Sister , stuff [like] [that] . [And] [I'm] convinced [that] , [that] , [that] at least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] [a] , some sort [of] _group_ . [You [know] ,] activity [like] [that] . 
B|80| M: There's [a] [group] [for] [this] 
A|81| A: [You [know] .] Twenty-five [, _I] don't_ [know .] Twenty-five percent ? A asks someone else [in the] _Yeah ,_ my wife [was] [big] [in] [that] 
B|82| M: Yes , yes , yes . 
A|83| A: [And] _she_ thinks , yeah , twenty-five percent . It , _it [was_ a] small school 
B|84| M:  ... 
A|85| A: But [, uh ,] _Yeah _,_ but_ [, [I] mean ,] [a] , [a] , _a lot of people_ would [get] _involved_ [and] [, you know ,] because there _were_ all different , organizations _to do_ . There [was] _Big Brother_ , _Big_ Sister , 
B|86| M: [Big Brother] 
A|87| A: [they] [had a] yearly auction , [they] [had a] dance marathon [for] charity or , [to] , [to] support [that] , [group] . 
B|88| M: [They] [were] [the] most popular [, and they] [were] [the] first [to be] popular 
A|89| A: Such [that] [, you know ,] lots _of people_ got _involved_ [that] way . 
B|90| M: [I'm] curious [about] [the] reason why [it was] done [, like] [the] [people who] [had] [the] _money_ 
A|91| A: [Yeah .] 
B|92| M: [Oh] . [That's] cool . 
A|93| A: _Yeah ,_ [no] , neither [do] [I] . [I think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you [know] .] 
B|94| M: [You] _can_ [, but] [I] don'think [it's] going [to _be] [a_ lot of people] [getting] [involved] . 
A|95| A: _Yeah [,_ they're] [not] worth [a] year . Or some [people] [just ,] [just] [can't] even afford [it] [, you know ,] whatever . [I mean [,] the] Peace Corps doesn't pay very well . [You know ?] 
B|96| M: [That] . [about] . [it .] [it] 
A|97| A: People [get] shipped off [and] then [, you know [,] and] then [, and] then their parents [, [I] [have] a] [, uh ,] [a] , [a] friend whose , whose son [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala , or daughter [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: i ... 
A|99| A: [And] [, you know ,] he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and] [, you know [,] [I] know] [I] could _never_ afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] Guatemala . 
B|100| M: [You] [can't] 
A|101| A: [You [know] ,] so 
B|102| M: [I] [can't] , 
A|103| A: so [I think] [, you know [,] and] [, and] [, and] [the] kid's certainly [not] making [much] [money] . 
B|104| M: She's [not] . 
A|105| A: So [I] [can] _see where_ [that] , [that] , may [be a] problem . 
B|106| M: [Because] [, I] [can't] [see where] [the] line [is] drawn . 
A|107| A: [Just] take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: Is [she] [a] 
A|109| A: _Yeah [,_ _I] don't ,_ 
B|110| M: [I] am [not] [, but] [I'm] going [to] try [to be] . 
A|111| A: _Yeah ,_ yeah , well neither [can] [I ,] so [, [I] , [I] , [I] , [I] , [I] , [I] ,] did my service before [and] I'll [do] my little community service throughout [, but] _never_ _never_ _for a_ year _again_ . 
B|112| M: [I think] [you] [mean] [in the] sense [of] [never] having [to do] _anything_ [for a] month [again] 
A|113| A: So , so [I] guess our vote [is] [no] 
B|114| M: [I don't [,] I] don t [, I'm] [just] [here] [to help] . 
A|115| A: Well [, it's] [been] nice talking [to] [you] [again] . 
B|116| M: [I'm] glad [you're] [here] 
A|117| A: Well , yeah _, we're _,_ we're_ slowly [getting] everything back _together_ [again] . [You [know] ,] [it] [, it's] taking [time [,] but] everything [, you know ,] 
B|118| M: [Yeah [,] I'm] sorry . 
A|119| A: [we] got lucky . [We] [had] [no] damage [to] our [house] or [anything] so , The rest will [just [have] to] come with [time] . 
B|120| M: [I'm] sure [the] [house] [is] fine . 
A|121| A: Well , [good] luck [to] [you] , [too] . 
B|122| M: We're [, we're [,] and we're] gonna [be] [together] [for a] while . 
A|123| A: Bye-bye or 
B|124| M: Ok , bye .
