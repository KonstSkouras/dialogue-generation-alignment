A|27| A: So [, uh _,] you know [,_ I] decided [this] summer _that_ [, uh _,] you know ,_ we had enough credit _on_ [the] credit cards _to buy_ [the] materials _so_ [I] did . 
B|28| M: [I] [know ,] right ? 
A|29| A: _And , uh ,_ _see the_ [, the] [, the] state has [a] law _that_ says [you] cannot _borrow_ [the] _money to_ build _your own_ home . 
B|30| M: _I _have_ a_ friend who's [a] lawyer _, he's_ [going] [to] sue [you] for [this] . 
A|31| A: _You can_ _borrow_ [the] _money to_ pay somebody else [to] build [your] [house] but [you] can't _borrow_ [the] _money to_ build _your own_ . 
B|32| M: Can [you] [borrow] [money [to] buy] [your [own] house] ? 
A|33| A: _Well _,_ it's_ [to] protect [the] [, the] banks from guys _that_ say yeah [I] want [to] build _my_ [own house] _and_ go _out_ [a] build [a] spec home 
B|34| M: What's [the] point [of] having [a] bank _then_ ?

A|37| A: _Well_ . 
B|38| M: [I] don't _have a_ bank . 
A|39| A: As , as _you know ,_ anything _that_ involves [the] government [is] , works half as well as [it's] supposed [to] costs three times as much . Right ? 
B|40| M: That's why they _call_ [it] [a] [bag .] 
A|41| A: Hence [the] savings _and_ loan [problem] we [have] . 
B|42| M: We [have] [no] [money [to] buy] . 
A|43| A: But [, uh _,] you know ,_ _my_ home [is] [, uh ,] fairly simple _. It's_ designed _to be_ added _on_ [to] . 
B|44| M: [I] think you're misunderstanding [the] question . 
A|45| A: [Yeah .] _Well [,_ I] figure [it's] [just] me _and_ _my_ wife but _, you know [,_ _I] like_ [to] _do_ stuff [with] _my_ hands _and_ whatnot , _so_ [I] want [to] [have a] _shop ._ 
B|46| M: [You] [do] [you] , ummm , [have] [you] tried any _other_ hobby ? 
A|47| A: Ten acres . 
B|48| M: Do [you] [have _a] lot of_ plants ? 
A|49| A: _Well ,_ yeah _. It's_ really nice too [because] [I] can't _see_ _my_ nearest neighbor . _He's_ _on_ [the] [other] _side of_ [a] hill . 
B|50| M: [I like] [the] [look] [of] [it] . 
A|51| A: _And_ _my_ _second_ nearest neighbor _is a_ dot _on_ [the] horizon . Seriously . 
B|52| M: [He's] right . 
A|53| A: _Well ,_ [in the] winter time [, I] _can see_ , _see_ another _guy_ but _, you know [,_ he's] 
B|54| M: What [do] [you] _mean_ ? 
A|55| A: [I] _can_ [just] _make_ _out_ his place _, you [know_ .] _I've_ got [a] thirty mile view [to] [the] east _and_ _about_ ten miles [to] [the] north . 
B|56| M: Not [in the] sun . 
A|57| A: _And , uh ,_ 
B|58| M: [And , uh [,] uh] 
A|59| A: [Yeah .] _Well [,_ I] took [a lot of] time [in] choosing [this] site [because] [the] [, [the] house] has [no] heating or _air_ conditioning . 
B|60| M: [Well ,] how [about] [you] ? 
A|61| A: [Well _,] it's_ got [a] , _a very_ small furnace . 
B|62| M: How [do] [you] [like] [your] ... 
A|63| A: [And] [a] [, uh ,] we'll use [a] _wood burning_ stove as well . 
B|64| M: I'll [make] [a] fire . 
A|65| A: But , [in [the] house] itself , _I've_ _been_ working inside _, you know ,_ these , these many months 
B|66| M: [It's] _not_ [that] [. It's] [the] [wood burning] . 
A|67| A: _and_ [I have] [not] had [to] use _the heat_ . 
B|68| M: You've [been] using [the heat] ? 
A|69| A: [Because] [it's] all geothermal . 
B|70| M: Why [is] [the] [air] [so] cold ? 
A|71| A: [And] [with] all [the] , _see_ _I've_ got , _on_ [the] south _side is_ all glass . [Well ,] as much as [I] could get [in] [it] _, you [know_ .] [And _, uh ,] the_ east _side is_ glass . 
B|72| M: [I have] seen [this] . 
A|73| A: _I've_ got one , two , three , four , five , six _windows [in_ the] east _side_ _on_ forty-eight feet . So [it's] almost all glass . 
B|74| M: No [, the] west [side [is] [a] lot] more green . 
A|75| A: [And , uh ,] 
B|76| M: [I] think , if you're [going] [to be] [that] [guy] [, it's] , [like] , if [, uh , the] East [side of] [the] Mississippi , [it] should [be] [the] East Side [of] [the] State . 
A|77| A: Oh , yeah . [I] [mean] _, you [know_ .] There's [no] place [in [the] house] where [you] _can_ stand _and_ [not] _see_ four _windows ._ 
B|78| M: [I've] always wondered why [I've] never seen any [windows in] [my] [house .] 
A|79| A: So [, uh ,] 
B|80| M: [I like] [windows .] 
A|81| A: [Well ,] [not] really [. It's] [, uh [,] it's] _on_ [the] [side of] [a] hill . 
B|82| M: Is [that] [the] only door ? 
A|83| A: So [the] first _, you know [,_ the] [, the] [, the] , _what_ [I] [call] residential level at [the] [side] that's [in the] hill [is] [about] four feet deep . 
B|84| M: What [is] [the] [second] floor ? 
A|85| A: [And] [the] [side] that's _on_ [the] [, uh , the] [other] [side is] [about] six feet high . 
B|86| M: [You] [know] [what] ? 
A|87| A: So [I've] got [a] pretty good grade there . 
B|88| M: He nods . 
A|89| A: [And] [then] when [I] put [the] verandas which will [be] twelve feet _out_ all [the] way around _on_ [the] north , south _and_ east sides [that] will define _the _shop_ ._ 
B|90| M: [I] think you'll find [it's] [a very] confusing [shop .] 
A|91| A: Exactly . 
B|92| M: [I'm] [going] [to] [make] [a] joke [about] [it] . [I'm] [going] [out] [on] [a] limb [and] saying [that] [this] [is a] Victorian [shop .] 
A|93| A: Uh-huh . 
B|94| M: [You [can] [see] the] little shelf for [the] back [of] [the shop] [in the] picture . 
A|95| A: Uh-huh . 
B|96| M: Uhhh [, you know ,] [I'm a] human .
