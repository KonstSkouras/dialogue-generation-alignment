A|1| A: And _, uh _,_ I'm_ in California , which has _a_ lot _of_ immigration . Probably _more_ than any where else in _the_ _country_ , though _I'm not sure_ if _that's_ _the_ case . 
B|2| M:  ... 
A|3| A: Uh-huh , yeah . 
B|4| M: Not . 
A|5| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|6| M: _It's a_ state _, not_ [a] _country ._ 
A|7| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|8| M: Uhh , where's [the] rest _of the_ world ? 
A|9| A: _Yeah_ . Sure _, well ,_ Texas , used _to_ be part [of] Mexico , or most [of] _it_ 
B|10| M: _I think_ we _are [,_ uh [,] uh] 
A|11| A: Huh . 
B|12| M: No [, [I'm] not] . 
A|13| A: [I] , _I don't_ either . [It's a] really delicate [, uh ,] moral , issue . Because , if _you_ have _, well ,_ [I] guess [the] one _thing_ [I] do see _that_ _is_ , _is_ _that_ needs _to_ be [a] solution _is_ , _that_ if _you_ do let people into [the] [country] , [I] do feel _you_ have [a] certain obligation _to_ , _to_ get them _on_ their feet . 
B|14| M: This 
A|15| A: Because otherwise _what_ _you're_ doing _is_ _you're_ letting people in _and_ _you're_ , _you're_ dooming them _to_ being underclass people . 
B|16| M: _You_ _can't_ . 
A|17| A: [You] _know ,_ _you're_ dooming them _to_ ghetto _life_ or whatever . And _I know that ,_ _that the_ Southeast Asians _, the_ Hmong people _that_ I've done some work with [, uh ,] feel _very_ quite hurt _and_ _, and_ unsure [of] themselves when here . Because they're coming from _, you know ,_ from [the] slash _and_ burn intercultural society _, you know ,_ they're coming from [the] middle ages , basically . And they're being plunked down , plunked down into America . Many [of] them had _been_ promised by [the] C [I] A , during [the] war over there , _that_ because _they_ co-operated with [the] C [I] A _, and_ _they_ helped [the] C [I] A out , _that_ when _they_ came here _, the_ C [I] A _would_ help establish them in America _, and_ [the] C [I] A , [of] course , isn't doing _that ._ 
B|18| M:  
A|19| A: And [, uh ,] so _they_ come here _and_ _they_ _don't know what_ [the] heck they're doing . And they're finding themselves adrift in [the] big cities . And , [of] course , there [are] people in [the] big cities who _would_ do , _like_ nothing better than _to_ take advantage [of] them . 
B|20| M: [I] . 
A|21| A: And they're , they're incredible victims [of] crime . And part [of] _it_ _is_ _this_ lack [of] , lack [of] basic information , being dissimilated . And [I'm not] _saying_ _it's_ easy _to_ do _, and_ _I know_ there [are] [a] few people who [are] trying _, but_ _, but_ [the] funding isn't there for _very_ much work _to_ be going _on_ . 
B|22| M:  
A|23| A: _Uh_ , yeah , exactly . 
B|24| M:  ... 
A|25| A: [I] _mean_ , these [are] people who _don't_ have [the] foggiest idea about _what_ America's _like_ . 
B|26| M: [You] _can't_ . 
A|27| A: Um _, and_ _it's_ _, it's_ , [I] , [I] couldn't really conceptualize _how_ hard _it_ was _to_ _understand_ _that_ until [I] , until [I] met with them . And [I] realized _that _,_ they_ , some [of the] information _that_ [I] _just_ _, you know ,_ _don't_ even realize _and_ _know_ _is_ information _, they_ _don't_ have . And [I] _never_ thought _, well ,_ [I] guess _that_ _is_ something _you_ need _to_ _know _,_ _you know_ ._ People getting into trouble because _they_ come here _, and_ so _they_ start farming _on_ [, uh ,] available land _, _you know_ ._ Like [the] median strips _on_ freeways because no one's using _it _._ But_ then someone comes along _and_ says _you_ [can't] do _that _,_ _you know_ ._ _Why_ [can't] _they_ ? _They_ have no idea _why_ [not] , some , some [of] them _, _you know_ ._ The ones _that_ have _been_ here longer _and_ have _been_ in _, you know ,_ _understand_ now _. But_ when _they_ initially come over , 
B|28| M:  
A|29| A: _Yeah ,_ 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: 'cause they're farmers . These , [are] all farmers coming over , 
B|32| M:  
A|33| A: _and_ they're being put in [the] middle [of the] city 
B|34| M:  ... [why] ? 
A|35| A: [I] _mean_ they're nomadic farmers _, you know ,_ they're people who farm _on the_ hillside _and_ then leave [the] hillside _to_ _another_ hillside _and_ farm _on_ _that_ hillside . 
B|36| M: _So_ [like] ... [a] farmer's [life] ? 
A|37| A: These [are] people who've _never_ seen flat ground before _and_ people who've _never_ seen property rights before . [You] _know ,_ these people who've _never_ seen any machines other than those used in war . And [, uh _,] they_ have _, _you know_ ._ [So] [I] , [I] , [I] do have [a] lot [of] sympathy for them _, and_ [I] feel _that_ America could try [a] little bit harder _to_ , _to_ help people adjusting _to the_ American _way ._ Because if _they_ _don't_ , _you're_ _just_ going _to_ produce _, you know ,_ _you're_ going _to_ produce an underclass _, _you know_ ._ You're going _to_ get [a] situation _that_ [I think] [a] lot [like] _what_ happened _to the_ blacks , being sort [of] led out [of] slavery _and_ then , then many [of] them ended up _just_ working [the] same jobs _they_ were as slaves then . And there was no , real up , upward movement . 
B|38| M:  
A|39| A: And [, not] being _, you know ,_ 
B|40| M:  
A|41| A: Um , 
B|42| M:  
A|43| A: _Well ,_ 
B|44| M: _Oh , you_ did . 
A|45| A: [I] , [I] wasn't helping them . [I] worked with them [, not] _to_ help them _, but_ for _my_ own purposes . [I'm] [, I'm] [a] linguist _and_ [I] was [, uh ,] doing _a language_ , trying _to_ _learn_ their _language_ , [a] little bit . And [I] actually _, um ,_ [I] _mean_ , helped them them in [the] sense _that_ _they_ received money for working with me _. But I_ didn't , [I] didn't , [I] wasn't [a] social worker or anything [like] _that ._ 
B|46| M: [I] 
A|47| A: [I] do have friends who have tried _to_ do _more_ , social work _, you know ,_ by explaining _to_ people _how_ [the] _language_ _, and_ _what_ [the] problems learning _English_ might be _and_ such . 
B|48| M: _you ,_ i'm 
A|49| A: Because all [the] models [of] teaching _English_ [are] based _on_ teaching _English_ _to_ _Spanish_ speakers or _to_ other European _language_ speakers . And people _don't_ realize _how_ different some [of the] languages _they_ speak [are] . 
B|50| M: [English] ? 
A|51| A: [Oh , you] [are] ? 
B|52| M: [English] [is] [my] second [language] . 
A|53| A: Uh-huh _, well_ [you ,] 
B|54| M: [I] am [not] . 
A|55| A: That's _, that's_ _been_ [my] impression . 
B|56| M: No [, they] teach [you] [how] [to] go [on] [and] [on] [and] [learn] [another] [way .] 
A|57| A: _Yeah_ . [It's] _, it's_ [not] , they're [not] withholding information , 
B|58| M: [It's] ... [it's] ... 
A|59| A: [they] _just_ _don't_ have _that_ information . 
B|60| M: [It's] [not] [a] step [, _it's] a_ step 
A|61| A: _They_ [, they] haven't [the] foggiest idea . 
B|62| M: [They] should [just] release [it] [on the] 14th . 
A|63| A: Yes . 
B|64| M: [So] [you're] [saying] _you don't_ [like] [it] ? 
A|65| A: And _Spanish is_ , pretty close [to] _English ,_ really . 
B|66| M: _Spanish is a_ dialect [of] [English [,] not] [a language] . 
A|67| A: And [Spanish is a] lot [like] [English] . 
B|68| M: It [is] . 
A|69| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|70| M: Do [you [know] [that] the] word'i'is'a'word ? 
A|71| A: _Yeah ,_ yeah . _Yeah_ . 
B|72| M: [I know that [,] _but] [I_ don't] [like] [it .] 
A|73| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|74| M: Uhh [, um [,] uh] ... [I] [like] [it .] 
A|75| A: Uh-huh . 
B|76| M: uuhh , uuhh . 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|78| M: uhuh . Uhuh . 
A|79| A: [Oh [,] I'm] _sure_ [it] _would_ . 
B|80| M: Maybe [. But I] wouldn't say [that .] 
A|81| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|82| M: Uhhh ... [Yeah [,] that's] [not] [how] [it] works . 
A|83| A: [Yeah ,] [it] _would_ be [a] good experience _, and_ you'd be helping people [, I'm] _sure_ . Very much . And [and] [I] _mean_ [, not] [to] put [, not] [to] trivialize [the] problems [of] any immigrant group [but I] do [know] [the] Asian groups [are] having [a] lot [of] trouble . [I] _mean_ _, and_ part [of the] problem [is] [that ,] [a] lot [of] Chinese [and] Japanese immigration from _, you know ,_ decades ago has _been_ _very_ successful because [they] valued education [and] so forth . 
B|84| M: No . 
A|85| A: [They] became [a] _very_ successful immigrant group [. But] _, and_ [, but] [a] lot [of] people coming over from Vietnam , right now , coming from worn torn countries , [are ,] [are] [not] having [the] same success . [I think] some people have [just] assumed _, well ,_ [why] , [why] [can't] [you] be successful ? The Japanese were , or [the] Chinese were , or something . And [it's] really much _more_ complicated . 
B|86| M:  . 
A|87| A: [Yeah _,] the_ times [are] different , yeah . 
B|88| M:  . 
A|89| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|90| M: No [, not] family 
A|91| A: Uh-huh . 
B|92| M: [I don't] [think] [you] [understand] [the] point [of] [this] post . 
A|93| A: [Oh ,] yeah . [I] , [I think] [it's a] wonderful _thing_ [to] do . And there's [a] lot , there's [a] lot _more_ , [I] guess [another] possible solution [is] , since taxpayers aren't going [to] start paying _more_ money for [this] [and] _, and_ other budgets aren't going [to] be cut [to] pay for [it] [, uh ,] _more_ [of the] volunteer network service . 
B|94| M: Uuh 
A|95| A: Because everyone gains from [it .] 
B|96| M: [Why] [would] anyone donate [to] [a] charity ? 
A|97| A: Would be , [would] , might be really useful _. Uh_ _, and_ if [it's] _, you know [,_ uh ,] [just] people helping people [I think] makes , makes [the] community so much happier . 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: Uh-huh . Yes . 
B|100| M: Uhhhhhh [. Uh] [. Uh] 
A|101| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|102| M: [Well [,] the] [more] [you know .] 
A|103| A: Yes , yes , I've known people with effectively worthless degrees in [this] [country .] [I] _mean_ _, and_ they're highly educated people [, but] [of] course , if [you're] educated [and] [you don't] speak [English ,] no one thinks anything [of] [you] . 
B|104| M: [You] [mean] you've [never] [been] [to the] US ? 
A|105| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [I'm not sure] [you] [understand] [how] [that] works . 
A|107| A: [Yeah ,] [I] do too . [Well ,] [It's] [been] good talking with [you] . 
B|108| M:  ... [I [don't] know what] [to] say . 
A|109| A: [Uh] , okay . 
B|110| M: [Oh [,] uh [,] well [,] you know [,] that's] [not] [a] bad [thing] . 
A|111| A: Okay , [it] does sound [like] [you] have some children [to] take care [of] 
B|112| M: She nods [, and] she's [very] nice . 
A|113| A: [Uh] , Okay , bye-bye .
