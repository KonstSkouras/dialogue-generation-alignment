B|1| M: _I don't_ _think_ _so_ . 
A|2| A: Anyway , _do_ _you have a pet_ ? 
B|3| M: _Yeah , _I_ _know_ ._ 
A|4| A: Oh ! _like_ _a_

A|6| A: Oh , _I'm_ [so] _sorry ._ But _that's_ good _that_ you're going to get another one . 
B|7| M: [I] [just] _had a_ kitten . 
A|8| A: [I know] some _of_ _my_ friends who _have_ pets _, uh [,_ and] they [just] are really _, you know ,_ _the_ ones _that_ _have_ dogs are very _, uh ,_ protective _of_ them [and] _I think_ _that's_ one _reason_ they _have_ them , especially older people _that_ [I _know] ,_ _that_ _have_ pets . But they [just] , um , really take care _of_ them , or _, uh ,_ are protective _of_ them . 
B|9| M: _that ,_ 
A|10| A: [Yeah ,] an [, and] _my_ , _my_ kids , 
B|11| M: Food . 
A|12| A: um , they really _want a_ _dog_ badly [, and] they've been looking [and] looking [and] _want_ _, you know ,_ they'd take anything _I think_ 
B|13| M: [I] [want _a] lot_ [of] course . 
A|14| A: _but_ , um [, [I] don't] [know] _do_ _you_ _like_ [, I] guess your _cat_ _was_ an indoor _cat ._ 
B|15| M: He [was] never in [my] house _, but I_ [do] [like] [the] [cat .] 
A|16| A: It kind [of] traveled around travel . 
B|17| M: You're [a] [cat] ? 
A|18| A: [Yeah ,] _when_ [I] [had a] Cocker Spaniel _it_ , _it was_ an outdoor _dog_ [and] _, uh , I think_ [I] liked [that] _better_ . 
B|19| M: Did [you know] [the] [dog] [was] trained ? 
A|20| A: [Yeah ,] _that's_ _true ._ 
B|21| M: Yes , _it's_ 
A|22| A: [Yeah ,] _that's_ _true ._ Take them _for_ walks _, right_ . [Yeah , I] see all [the] people on , on Sunday going _for_ [a] walk with their dogs [and] [, and] [I] , _I'm_ kind [of] skeptical with [my] son getting [a] [dog] , _I'm_ [like] [I know] _it_ will be fun [the] first week maybe , 
B|23| M: no . 
A|24| A: [and] then mom gets to take care [of] _it_ , or something . _So_ [, I] 
B|25| M: [that's] 
A|26| A: Oh , [that's] exciting . [Yeah] . 
B|27| M: [So] 
A|28| A: [Yeah _, I] think_ [it's] really important to [that ,] [that] if [you] get [a pet] [that] they're either spayed or neutered [so] [that _,] you know ,_ we're not [just] going on with this [pet] population [and] having to , [just] get rid [of] them . 
B|29| M: It'shoot . 
A|30| A: That , [that] kind [of] gripes on me some [, but] [, but [I] don't] [know .] 
B|31| M: It's [the] [same] [reason] [you have a pet] . 
A|32| A: More [and] more people are , Right _, right_ . 
B|33| M:  ... 
A|34| A: But _, uh ,_ 
B|35| M: And [, uh , I think] [, you know [,] and] 
A|36| A: [I think] [that's] really _true ._ 
B|37| M: The best part _is_ [when] [you] realize [it's] [true .] 
A|38| A: [Yeah] . 
B|39| M: [I'm] [sorry .] 
A|40| A: [Yeah ,] exactly . 
B|41| M: You're talking about [the] kittens [, right] ? 
A|42| A: Exactly . [I think] our _community_ [is] [a lot] more conscious [now] _though_ too [, and] [, and] [that's] good too . 
B|43| M: It's still [a lot] [better] than [the] [community] . 
A|44| A: Well [, I think] [that's] all [I] [have] to say . 
B|45| M: It's fine . Thanks [for] [the] talk [though] 
A|46| A: Okay , [have a] good night . All [right] , bye-bye . 
B|47| M: [I think] [it was] [the] [same] .
