B|36| M: [I don't] [understand] _what_ [you] mean .

B|38| M: [I'm] [not] sure _what_ [you] mean . 
A|39| A: Right . Right . Um _, I think_ [I] , I've singled out _my_ grandchildren [and] _but_ actually _they're_ _, they're_ _pretty good_ , along those lines as compared _to_ [what I] have seen [from] other people's children [and] grandchildren , mine aren't _really_ that bad , 
B|40| M: [I] 
A|41| A: _but_ at _the_ same time _I think_ _it_ _would_ _do_ them [a] world [of] [good .] 
B|42| M: [I like] 
A|43| A: But there's [a] , 
B|44| M: [It's] [a] [pretty good] game [, I think] 
A|45| A: Mandatory _just_ _like ,_ [like] _the_ _draft_ . No . 
B|46| M: Mandate everyone [to do] [a] [draft] ? 
A|47| A: Every time _you ,_ _They could_ buy their way out . 
B|48| M: [They could] [just] [be] paid [a] minimum wage [of] 250 , 000 [a] [year] . 
A|49| A: Right , [you] [know] , [they] , they'd figure [a] way around that one [in] [a] heartbeat . But [, I'm] wondering [if] there's another issue here , [and] maybe this [is] why this has died out . _Can _you_ go_ into , [and] this wasn't _the_ question _but_ [it's] , _it_ may [be] _the_ _more of_ _the_ issue versus _should_ young adults , can [they] _go_ [in] there [and] can anyone _go_ into , well , out [of] _the_ Kurdish community [is] [a little] bit extreme at this time _, but_ say [, I think] Bangladesh _would_ have been [a] [good] example [or] some , some _really_ desperate situation [and] teach them [to] farm [and] teach them [and] _it_ doesn't [do] any [good .] 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: _I don't know_ that _it_ does _. I_ [, I] , _don't know_ that , um , [if] [you] step _back_ [from] _the_ current issue [and] look at _it_ _more_ intellectually , there _are_ forever over , as long as _we_ [know] there _are_ races [of] _people_ that _are_ dropping out . 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: [You] [know] , we're losing certain , races [of] _people_ . 
B|54| M: _it ._ 
A|55| A: There _are_ _people_ now that _are_ obsolete point [and] fact [just] , [just] [like] endangered species [of] animals , so there _are_ quote tribes [of] _people_ , that _are_ endangered [or] obsolete . 
B|56| M: What [are] [you ,] [a] historian ? 
A|57| A: And [I'm] [just] wondering [if] you're fighting [a] natural process there [of] being winnowed out . There's [a] German word [for] [it] [that's] elegant _, but_ [I] never can remember [what] [it] [was] , uh _, but_ _, but_ that _they're_ _, they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ , where _they are_ _they're_ [not] adapted [to] their environment essentially . 
B|58| M:  
A|59| A: Um , [and] one [of] _the_ quick examples [is] _the_ Aborigines . 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: Uh , when _we_ were [in] Australia , uh , sad [little] things . Uh [, I] felt _sorry_ [for] them . Because their society isn't there anymore , [and] their belief system [and] all their structured [of] theirs , all _the_ structures [of] their society [are] gone , essentially . 
B|62| M: _They're_ 
A|63| A: And _they're_ [just] kind [of] _more_ [like] _a side_ show than anything else [and] [that's] sad . 
B|64| M: _They're not_ [really [a] side] shows [, they're] [more of] [a] cult . 
A|65| A: But [I don't] [think] there's any way [you] [could] _go_ , uh , _the Peace_ Corps [could] _go_ [in] [and] rescue those _people_ , [and] [I don't] [think] [you] [could] have done [it] fifty [or] [a] hundred years ago either . 
B|66| M: [I'm] [sorry] . 
A|67| A: _So_ [, I] [, I'm] wondering [if] _the Peace_ Corps [is] , [really] an effective tool . 
B|68| M: [I don't know] [. I think] [they] [would] [be] . 
A|69| A: Good point . We've [got] enough without without [a] passport there's [plenty] . 
B|70| M: [Can you] get 
A|71| A: Yes [. _I think] we_ ought [to] worry _about_ our own species . 
B|72| M: [I think _we] should be_ worried [about the] [people] who [are] [in the] military . 
A|73| A: [I] wonder now [in] , [and] I've been out [of] school too long [to] answer this _, but_ [I] wonder [if] there aren't some sociology courses . 
B|74| M: Social studies 
A|75| A: [That's] [the] last thing [you] want , [to do] . 
B|76| M: [You] 
A|77| A: [Yeah [,] that's] exactly [it .] 
B|78| M: [I] 
A|79| A: [They're not] _going to_ take that [money] [you] _give_ them [and] _go_ try [to] figure out [a] way [to] dry out with [it .] Now come _on_ , let's [be] realistic , 
B|80| M: [It's] [like [,] but] [you go] 
A|81| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|82| M: [The] only reason [I'm] even considering [it] [is] [because] [I'm] trying [to] get [my] parents [to] [give] me [a] loan . 
A|83| A: Right . 
B|84| M: [You] can't [go] [back] [to] [work] . 
A|85| A: No , we're [not] [I don't] [think] [. I think] [, that's] [more] realistic than making them [go] [in _the] Peace_ Corps . 
B|86| M: [So] [do] [you] [think] [they are] [going [to] be] [on] [the Peace] corps ? 
A|87| A: [I think] [that's] [a] lot [more] realistic . Uh [, I] [, I think] that [we should be] spending [more] time [and] , [and] again [I don't] [think] [the] , [the Peace] Corps [is] , [is] as successful now simply [because] [it's] [not .] [It] doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|88| M: [That's] [not] true . 
A|89| A: Uh , we've [got plenty] , [in] fact , we've [got] far too many . You're [in] , uh , [what] Flower Mound ? 
B|90| M: N 
A|91| A: [I] [was] [, that's] exactly [what I] [was] [going to] ask [you] . Have [you] ever , have , have [you] been downtown
