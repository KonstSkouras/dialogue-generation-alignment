A|71| A: [Yeah ,] where _are _you_ ?_ 
B|72| M: _Are [you_ in] _this_ picture ? 
A|73| A: Okay . So we're [in] Garland . 
B|74| M: [I'm] [in the] same area 
A|75| A: [Yeah] 
B|76| M: [You know ,] I'll [just] walk over _to the_ other side [of] [the] river . 
A|77| A: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
B|78| M: [I] [know .] [I'm] [in] east _Texas_ . 
A|79| A: Just because there's [a friend] up there , [not] because there's [much] else 
B|80| M: Why [are you] talking [about] [the] internet ? 
A|81| A: For colleges ? 
B|82| M: [I] [know ,] _right_ ? 
A|83| A: [Well ,] [they're] [not] 
B|84| M: [I'm] _from_ _East Texas_ . 
A|85| A: They're [not] _going to_ recruit me anymore [, I'm] through . [No] more [for] me . 
B|86| M: _The_ east _Texas_ _school_ [of] engineering _has a_ very large enrollment . 
A|87| A: _What_ _, what_ [do you] [do] ? 
B|88| M: [I] [do] . 
A|89| A: [Are you] _going to_ go [to] [East Texas] [for] [that] ? 
B|90| M: I'll _be_ [going to] [a] state _school_ [in the] northeast [, and] that'll _be_ [the] best part . 
A|91| A: That'd probably [be] [pretty] interesting . _I was_ summonsed down [to the] courthouse last week [. They] had summonsed eight hundred people , [about] four hundred showed up [, and] [it] _was_ [for a] murder trial . 
B|92| M: lol 
A|93| A: This [guy] had supposedly , uh , strangled [this] woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling down her throat [and] up her nose Anyway , [this] [is] happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|94| M: [What] ? 
A|95| A: And they had us fill out [a] long questionnaire . We stayed till [about] [one] thirty [and] [they're] [going to] call [the] ones [that] [they're] interested [in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three at [a] time [and] [the] trial won't take place until _June_ . 
B|96| M: [June] 
A|97| A: And they _say_ [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . And [this] [guy] [in] front [of] me _said_ [, I] can't believe _I was_ summonsed . _I was_ an investigator [and _I] was_ tailing [the] woman [that] _was_ killed . [Well ,] then [I have a friend] at [school] [that] [has a] boyfriend [that's a] lawyer [and] [he] _said_ [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] Plano had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the] [one] [that's] accused _was_ [the] [one] [that] actually did [it .] And she [has] since taken off [with] another lawyer [who] had been , uh , getting cocaine [from] his client [and] then selling [it] [, and] [he] had skipped bail [and] they finally extradited him [and] he's [going to] testify [for] [the] State against her _so_ he'll [have] his sentence reduced . 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: [Yeah] . 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: [The] , [the] investigator . [Yeah ,] [he] , [he] got off [right] away . 
B|102| M: [I] 
A|103| A: And [I] wrote [that] down on my questionnaire [that] _he'd_ _told_ me [that] , 
B|104| M: He [said] [he'd] _get_ [it] back . 
A|105| A: _so_ [I] figure [that] [that] will make me biased [and I] won't [be] chosen . 
B|106| M: [I'm] [not] sure [, [I] just] [know] [that] [I was] [told] [to] [say] [that] [I] wouldn't [have to] [say] anything . 
A|107| A: Hopefully 
B|108| M: I'll [do] [it .] 
A|109| A: [Yeah] . [No .] *aa 
B|110| M: [I mean [,] what] _would be_ [the] point [of] voting [for] [you ?] 
A|111| A: [I] [said] [that] [, I] could believe [in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but I] [would be] , I'd find [it] hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|112| M:  
A|113| A: [You [know] .] Uh-huh . 
B|114| M: [I] [know .] 
A|115| A: [Yeah] . But then [when] [you're] , [when] [you're] picked , see [I was] picked [for] another murder trial before 
B|116| M: [I'm] [so] sorry 
A|117| A: oh , gosh [and] [it's] [so] hard because [, you] [know ,] everybody [is] wanting [to] go on [and] [get] [the] sentence done [, and] [if you're] trying [to] hold out [, you] [know ,] there's [so] [much] pressure on [you] [and] you've got [to] come up [with] [a] decision . 
B|118| M: [Well]
