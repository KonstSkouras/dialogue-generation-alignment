B|6| M: Ah [. I] _didn't_ _get_ _that ._ 
A|7| A: _And_ he'd _never_ been outside , _like_ _, _you_ know_ , by himself outside . 
B|8| M: _I think_ _he was the_ [one] _who_ made [the] _cat_ _out_ _of his_ _own_ heart . 
A|9| A: _And_ _it_ started raining _and I_ [was] hysterical [. I] [was] _, I_ [was] _, _I_ mean _,_ you_ _would_ _have_ thought _a_ child _had_ died . 
B|10| M: [He jumped off] [a] [balcony] [and _I] had to_ laugh _at_ _that_ 
A|11| A: [I] called everyone [I] knew _, [I_ had] every _friend_ [I] knew _in the_ apartment searching _for_ _this_ _cat ._ 
B|12| M: Uhhh [, you] _had a_ [friend] ? 
A|13| A: _And_ _they_ laughed [at] _me_ _, they_ thought _that _was_ so_ hysterical .

B|22| M: I'm going _to_ _say_ _it ._ [The] [cats .] 
A|23| A: _And_ [they] [didn't] used _to be_ actually _, but_ [they] _got_ kind [of] wild [and] weren't doing [very] well inside , [so] [I] put [them] outside once [I] _got_ [a] house [and] they're doing great [out] _there_ [, they] _love_ [it .] _But_ [the] other _one _,_ the_ first [one] [I] _got_ _he doesn't_ _want_ anything _to do_ [with] outside unless _you're_ _there ._ 
B|24| M: You're _a big_ guy . 
A|25| A: Other than [that] [he] gets scared [to] death . If [you] shut [that] door [he] goes into hiding . 
B|26| M: _He's_ 
A|27| A: [I think] _it's_ _from_ [the] time [he] [jumped off] [the] [balcony] 
B|28| M: When _did he_ die ? 
A|29| A: _And_ Lord knows _what happened to him_ . _He's probably_ been through all kinds [of] nightmares . 
B|30| M: [He's probably] dead 
A|31| A: Probably . 
B|32| M: _So_ [, _how] many_ times _is_ [this] gonna [be] posted ? 
A|33| A: Are [they] . 
B|34| M: [I] bet _they are_ 
A|35| A: _Oh_ no . 
B|36| M: _I am_ going [to be] [so] _sad_ if _we have to_ _see_ _any_ _of [my_ cats] [in the] future . 
A|37| A: _Oh my_ gosh . 
B|38| M: _I know it's_ _crazy_ , I'm [a] _vet_ tech . 
A|39| A: _Oh [,_ I] imagine . 
B|40| M: [I think] _he was_ _a dog_ _, _he_ was the_ most loving [, the] most obedient [cat] [I] _ever_ [had] . 
A|41| A: [I] wonder [how many] [of his] lives [he] missed , when [that] _happened_ . 
B|42| M: My cat's name _is_ Tom _, _and_ he_ loves _to play with_ [the] kids . 
A|43| A: _Oh [,_ I] can imagine _, what_ [did he] shoot _him_ [with] . 
B|44| M:  ... _I don't_ [think] [I've] _ever_ _seen_ [a] picture [of] [him] [in] [my] _life_ . 
A|45| A: _Oh my_ gosh . People [are] [crazy] . 
B|46| M: _What_ [did he] [do] ? 
A|47| A: _Oh_ Lord . 
B|48| M: I'm not gonna lie [, I] cried . 
A|49| A: _Oh_ man . 
B|50| M: [He] _is a_ kitten ! 
A|51| A: [I] imagine . _They_ usually [are] after something _like that_ happens [to] [them] . It seems [to] mellow [them] or something . 
B|52| M: How _is the_ [cat] _getting_ [so] much food ? 
A|53| A: [No] . 
B|54| M: _And [you_ know] [that] _they are_ [cats .] 
A|55| A: _Oh_ yeah [, I] [I] keep talking _about_ [getting] rid [of my] outdoor [cats] because [I] feel _like_ [I don't] [, _I] can't_ _take_ _care_ [of] [them] as well because they're outside , 
B|56| M: [I think] [you're] _thinking_ _of the_ [cats .] 
A|57| A: [and] [it] worries _me_ [that] [one] _day_ [one] [of] [them] won't come back , 
B|58| M: [I have] [a] _cat [,_ it's] _okay_ . 
A|59| A: [and I] feel _like_ [they] [need] [a big] home , _a nice_ place where someone can [have] [the] time [to play with] [them] [and] things . _But_ _I can't_ give [them] up . 
B|60| M: _You_ _should_ _just_ _get_ [a] [cat .] 
A|61| A: [I] [just] [, I] go hysterical when [they] [don't] come home . 
B|62| M: This _is_ [so] confusing 
A|63| A: _Oh ,_ oh yeah [, and] every time [you] [see] [one] hit _on the_ side [of the] road [you] [say] _is that my_ [cat .] 
B|64| M: [But] [you] [don't] [need] [to] worry [about] [the] [cat .] 
A|65| A: [And you] go [crazy] [thinking] [it] might [be] yours . 
B|66| M: I'm going [crazy] 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| M: _What_ ? I'm [just] saying [, I've] [never] _had a_ [cat] [that was] [just] _that ._ 
A|69| A: Ugh ! 
B|70| M: [I don't] [want] _to make_ _any_ promises [, but] I'm going _to take_ [a] bath [with] [a] bath . 
A|71| A: Really . 
B|72| M: [Oh _,] my_ . 
A|73| A: It's here now , [we have to] keep [it .] Yeah [, my] [, my] first [one] [that] [I] _got_ [, [I] had] [just] moved away _from_ home [and] _got_ [my] [own] apartment . It took _me_ [about] two weeks [to] realize , [that was] real lonely . 
B|74| M: You're not alone . 
A|75| A: [So] [I] found [this] [one] [and] , uh , actually [it] [was] _on_ [a] sign [at] Taco Bell drive-thru [that] _said_ _free_ _kittens ._ 
B|76| M: _I'll_ [take] [the] [free] kitten 
A|77| A: [And] [I] thought well _that's_ interesting , [I'll] call [them] . 
B|78| M: Yup . I'm [from] [there .] 
A|79| A: [And] [he was the] _only_ [one] _left_ [and] [his] _mother_ [had] been killed coming back across [the] road [to make] _sure_ she'd gotten all her _kittens ._ 
B|80| M: [He] _was the last [one_ [,] _but] [he_ was] [only] [there] [for] [a] couple [of] days . 
A|81| A: [And] [he [was the] last one] _she_ carried across [, [you] know] [, the] whole [big] [sad] story . 
B|82| M: [I don't] [think] [he was] [a] baby _, [he_ was] [just] [the last] person [she] [had] [on the] street . 
A|83| A: [So] [of] course [, [I] had [to] take] [him] [. I] felt [so] _sorry for_ [him] after [that .] 
B|84| M: [I] [didn't] [know] [he [was] so] cruel . 
A|85| A: [And] [he] _is ,_ uh [, you] can _tell_ [he was] weaned _too_ young because he'll nurse [on] [your] ears [and] [your] fingers . 
B|86| M: [I mean _,] [he_ was] born [with] [a] _head_ . 
A|87| A: Yeah [, he] [, I] asked [the] [vet] why [he] [did] [that] [and he] _said_ [he was] [probably] weaned _too_ young , which [he was] , because [his] mom [was] killed , [so] . 
B|88| M: I'm [sorry for] [your] loss [. I] hope [you] _get_ better soon . 
A|89| A: _But he_ [is the] lovingest [cat .] Everybody , people [who] [don't] _even_ _like_ [cats] , _like_ [him] . 
B|90| M: I'm [sorry] [to] hear [that .] 
A|91| A: [He] [never] meows [, he] [, _he] doesn't_ [have] [any] front claws [, [I] had] [him] declawed , 
B|92| M: [He's] adorable [, [what] happened to him] ? 
A|93| A: [but _he] doesn't bite_ anybody he's [just] , he's [just] kind [of] [there] , real friendly [and] docile . 
B|94| M: [But [he] doesn't bite] anyone . 
A|95| A: [Oh] yeah , yeah , [we] [do] , [we] call [that] doing biscuits , 
B|96| M: C 
A|97| A: "it looks _like_ their kneading bread *spelling ""their"" [should] [be] ""they're""" 
B|98| M: [Oh] yea , [yes]
