A|3| A: Uh-huh . 
B|4| M: Hmmm _. _I_ don't _know_ ._ 
A|5| A: _Oh_ , really ? Uh-huh . 
B|6| M: We bought _it_ _, and_ _it's_ [the] best thing _we've_ ever done . 
A|7| A: Uh-huh . _Well , I_ bet _you_ , Uh-huh .

A|11| A: _Well ,_ _that_ sounds interesting [. I] bet _he's_ enjoyed having [it] _that_ way 
B|12| M: He's [in] _his_ _garage_ 
A|13| A: because kind _of_ hard _to_ _find_ one prebuilt _that_ 's kind _of_ fits those specifications .

B|20| M: You've _never_ seen [a] 3 [car garage] ?

B|26| M: [I'm] _so_ sorry 
A|27| A: Now _, mine_ does [not] work _on_ [cars] , _he_ _just_ piddles _on_ this [and] _that ._ 
B|28| M: Your wife _is_ [a big] , 
A|29| A: But _he_ likes _to_ [have a] spot _to_ keep all [of] [his] , [his] piddling things . 
B|30| M: _And_ [he's] always busy . 
A|31| A: It really [is] . 
B|32| M: [Well [,] mine] [is] _still_ there . 
A|33| A: Because [, you] _know ,_ _they_ [have a] lot [of] things [of] their own [, and] [I] [, you] _know _,_ I_ wouldn't mind having [, and] [I] at one _time_ _was_ _going to_ fix up when one [of] my daughters left , [a] bedroom _to_ where [I] _had_ [a] room _to_ _just_ [put] all [of] my craft stuff [and] sewing machine [and] all _that_ kind [of] stuff , 
B|34| M: You [know ,] [the] _whole_ ,? 
A|35| A: _but I_ , _someone_ _, [I don't_ [know] ,] [it] ended up [I] got some furniture back _that_ one [of] _them_ _had_ moved out or something . 
B|36| M: [I don't] _think_ [it] [was] . 
A|37| A: So [I] didn't end up with my vacant room _like_ [I] _had_ thought [I] would . 
B|38| M: [I] 
A|39| A: Uh-huh . 
B|40| M: What [are] [you] doing ? 
A|41| A: Uh-huh . 
B|42| M: [I'm] [going to] _do [that_ .] 
A|43| A: Uh-huh . _Well , I_ [still] , all three [of] my daughters [are] married _, but_ _, [I don't_ [know] _,] _I_ just_ [still] [have] need _for_ [the] four bedrooms _just_ having company from _time to_ _time_ . [And] some [of] _them_ coming back home [and] things [, you] [know .] 
B|44| M: Uhh ... _well_ [, I _don't] ._ 
A|45| A: [And] [we've] got grandchildren now , [so] when _they_ come , _they_ [have] [to] [have a] place . 
B|46| M: [Oh] . Uh ... _I guess_ [that] makes sense . 
A|47| A: _That's_ right [, you] _sure_ [don't .] At times [I] keep thinking , though , [that] might _be_ kind [of] nice . 
B|48| M: [I'm] sorry [for] being [a] _little_ rude . 
A|49| A: Uh-huh . 
B|50| M: [I'm] [not] [a] girl [, [but] I] 
A|51| A: Uh-huh . 
B|52| M: What's [going] [on] ? 
A|53| A: Uh-huh . 
B|54| M:  ... why [is] [he] [in] [a] relationship ? 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . 
B|56| M: Ugh _, uh_ . 
A|57| A: _Well [, I_ don't] blame [you] [for] [that .] 
B|58| M: [I just] [had] [to] [be] told . 
A|59| A: _Well , I_ [have] [the] three girls [and] then we ended up with four grandsons . 
B|60| M: [I'm] [sure] I'll [find] [someone] [to] date . 
A|61| A: [And] [little] boys [are] around _the house_ [a] [whole] lot more than girls . 
B|62| M: He nods [and] smiles [Well , I] am [a] girl . 
A|63| A: [And] [, uh [,] I] enjoy _them_ coming [, but] [for] _short_ doses 
B|64| M: [I] love [them] [, but] [they] [are] too [short] [for] me 
A|65| A: It feels , after they've been here ten minutes , [they] [have] already explored [the] entire _house_ , [they] [know] everything . 
B|66| M: [That's] [a] long [time to] wait [for] [them] [to] explore [the house] . 
A|67| A: But , they're fun . 
B|68| M: [They're] [not] . 
A|69| A: [Well , [I] just] _watch them_ . 
B|70| M: Do [you] [watch] [the] videos ? 
A|71| A: [I] [I] [never] did [put] things up when my kids were [little] [and] [I] haven't with [them] [. I] try [to] teach [them] [not] [to] get [into] things . 
B|72| M: You can [watch them] [, but] [they] [don't] [like] [it] . 
A|73| A: [I] [think] [that] once [you] [do that] , your children kind [of] develop [the] same attitudes . At least my daughters [have] . They try [to] teach theirs [not] [to] get [into] things instead [of] having [to] [put] everything up . So [it's] worked pretty [well] . There's [, I don't] really [think] anything's been broken . Every now [and] then we [have] [to] kind [of] go [and] say , now [don't] bother this [you] [know .] 
B|74| M:  
A|75| A: But , all [in] all , [they] mind pretty [well] . But [, [I] guess] most [of the] what kind [of] roof does your [house] [have] ? Here [I'm] getting off [the] subject .
