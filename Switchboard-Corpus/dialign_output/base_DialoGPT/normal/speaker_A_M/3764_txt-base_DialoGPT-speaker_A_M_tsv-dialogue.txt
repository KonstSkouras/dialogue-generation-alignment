B|4| M: Uhm _, uh ,_ huh . 
A|5| A: Look professional 
B|6| M: I'm _not_ . 
A|7| A: Yeah _, I_ _understand_ . _I am_ _a_ _, I_ own _my_ company . _I am_ _in the_ _, _I_ am [,_ uh ,] manufactures rep sales organization _and_ _my_ office is _a_ small office _and_ _I am_ _very_ casual _and_ [wear] slacks _and_ sports shirt _and_ things _like_ that 
B|8| M: [You] sound [like] _you're_ [in] [a] bad place . 
A|9| A: but then when [I] travel _it_ is [a] little different situation . 
B|10| M: [You] don't _have to_ [wear] [it] . 
A|11| A: Yeah _, I think_ [in] today's society [, uh ,] there is more credibility [to] be quite honest 
B|12| M: You're 
A|13| A: [I] will always remember _, I_ will tell this real quick story when [I] graduated _from_ college , _my_ first _job_ years ago [, uh ,] thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago , [in] fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|14| M: [uh] 
A|15| A: [I] worked [for] _the_ [, uh ,] Smith Douglas Division _of_ Borden Chemical _and_ [I] sold [uh _,] you know ,_ manure . 
B|16| M: That's [the] kind [of] stuff _I would_ never sell . 
A|17| A: And [, uh _,] [I_ would] go out _and_ _call_ on farmers _and_ [I would] always try [to] look _my_ best wearing sport coats _and_ things [like] that , but [I] was calling on guys that wore bib overalls . 
B|18| M: Uhh . 
A|19| A: And so , one day [I] got up _and_ thought well [I] will just go casual _and_ _you know_ that [I] called on [a] guy wearing exactly that , bib overalls , _and_ _he_ sort [of] told me that _he_ expected me [to] be professional 
B|20| M:  
A|21| A: _and_ _he_ sort [of] expected me [to] _dress_ as [a] professional 
B|22| M: Uhh , _what_ did [he] expect ? 
A|23| A: so [, uh ,] [it] was sort [of] , 
B|24| M: No [it] wasn't 
A|25| A: [You] bet even _back_ then 
B|26| M: He didn't expect [you] [to] come [back] . 
A|27| A: so [I] sort [, uh ,] been aware [of] _my dress_ ever since then _and_ try [to] look _my_ best , 
B|28| M: She does . 
A|29| A: but _here_ again [I] _dress_ casual quite [a] bit so , 
B|30| M:  ... [and] [here] [I am ,] sitting [in] [my dress] . 
A|31| A: _It_ _gives you_ _confidence ._ In [my] business _if_ _I call_ on [the] [the] J C Penney company [here] [in] Dallas or say someone say Sears [and] Roebuck [in] Chicago , then [I] [wear] coat [and] tie . If _I call_ on just [, uh ,] [a] normal little dealer [of] mine _, I_ might be casual . 
B|32| M: [I] don't [know] [if] [it] [gives you] any [confidence .] 
A|33| A: _I call_ on Oshman's sporting goods , again , [it] may be casual or [it] may be coat [and] tie . So [it] depends . 
B|34| M: _What about_ [the] jacket ? 
A|35| A: Uh , probably no . 
B|36| M: Are [you] 
A|37| A: but then [it] depends on who [you] are calling on . Who [you're] _, you_ [like] your minister standing up [in] front [of] [you] with no tie _, you_ just [, uh ,] [he] [would] be missing something . 
B|38| M: [I call] [it] [the] . 
A|39| A: Although , [he] shouldn't be evaluated on that . 
B|40| M: _But you_ can see [the] difference between [the] two 
A|41| A: So _, it's_ its' just different . 
B|42| M: Because [, you know ,] he's _not_ . 
A|43| A: Yes , [it] is . [I am [,] uh ,] [like] [a] Catholic [and] [the] people that go [to] [my] Church [, you know] Catholics [dress] _very_ casual [a] lot [of] [the] times . People [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever , but yet [the] way [I] was raised _, [I_ am] [a] converted Catholic , [the] way [I] was raised _, I_ was raised [a] Baptist [and] [like] as [a] youngster [I] use [to] always [dress] up all [the] time . _I guess_ that has changed also . 
B|44| M: I'm . 
A|45| A: Right . 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: Sure . 
B|48| M: _That_ , work . 
A|49| A: [But] . [That] is _a very_ good point . [I am] _from_ West Virginia so [I] _understand_ [what] [you] are saying there 
B|50| M: It's [a very] big city [in the] US . 
A|51| A: [and] _it's_ _it's_ [a very] good point . 
B|52| M: No [, it's] _not_ . 
A|53| A: [But you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|54| M: [I] don't [know [,] I think] [it's] pretty cool . 
A|55| A: And [, uh ,] evaluation [of] an individual . Course , all [of] [it] depends on [the] type [of] _job_ responsibility [you] [have] . [I _think] you_ [have to] [dress] sort [of] accordingly . 
B|56| M: [I] don't [think you] [understand] [the] concept [of] [a] [job] . 
A|57| A: [But] [, uh [,] you] certainly should [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and] [, uh ,] or evaluate [a] person by that . 
B|58| M: Oh . Well _, I guess_ [you're] right . 
A|59| A: [What about] _season to_ _season_ . Does [, I guess] your [dress] changes . 
B|60| M: [It] varies [from] [season to] seasons .
