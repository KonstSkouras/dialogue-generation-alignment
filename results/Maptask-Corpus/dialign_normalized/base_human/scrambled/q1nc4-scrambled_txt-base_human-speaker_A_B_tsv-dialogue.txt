A|12| f: _right_ 
B|13| g: [right] _now_ [right] what _you're [going_ to] _do_ _now_ is moving _down_ [all the] time but _you're_ _you're_ not [going to] follow [the] coastline as much _you're [going_ to] slightly move away from _it_ 
A|14| f: _yes_ 
B|15| g: _uh-huh_ 
A|16| f: [uh-huh] 
B|17| g: [right] 
A|18| f: directly _below it_

B|53| g: _do_ _you_ [have] [a] graveyard 
A|54| f: _right okay_ 
B|55| g: imagine [a] [a] triangle with ehm [an] equilateral triangle with [the] pebbled shore flagship [and] finish [right] can _you_ 
A|56| f: they're [all] [on] [a diagonal] 
B|57| g: [and] turn east [to] [and] travel [right] [along] 
A|58| f: [there's a] [cottage] [on] my [map] 
B|59| g: [no] _do_ _you_ [have] pebbled shore 
A|60| f: [uh-huh] 
B|61| g: _aye_ 
A|62| f: [yeah] 
B|63| g: oh [have] _you_ [got an] _old_ _pine tree_ sort _of_ [down] diagonally [right] from [the] cliffs 
A|64| f: [no] [so] [that's] irrelevant 
B|65| g: [right okay] 
A|66| f: [right okay] 
B|67| g: about [a] centimetre from [where] [it] says cliffs _to the_ _left-hand_ side _of it_ [okay] _then_ _you go_ back [left] slightly until [you're] beneath [the] [the] start [and] [down] _you_ _know_ [two] _or_ three inches until [you're] 
A|68| f: [uh-huh] 
B|69| g: _mm_ [right okay] is _that_ sort _of_ above [the] _lighthouse_ 
A|70| f: [i] can't _i don't_ [know] _if_ i'm supposed [to] tell [you] [that] 
B|71| g: _right so_ imagine you've _got a_ _tree_ _there_ [and] [i] want [you] [to] draw _between_ [where] [that] _tree_ would [be] [where] [the] pebbled shore is [so] _just_ keep drawing [go] make your line [go] [down] _a bit_ [right] [and] _just to_ [come] [to] above pebbled shore [and] _just_ stop [the] _end_ _there_ _and then_ ehm [i don't] suppose you've [got] finished marked [on] your [map] [no] [right] [have] [you] [got] anything [below] pebbled shore 
A|72| f: [of the] camp [or] [of the map] 
B|73| g: [and] [right] through 
A|74| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|75| g: [cottage] round [yes] 
A|76| f: [okay] 
B|77| g: _then_ [down] [uh-huh] [that's] [right]

A|80| f: [right] [all] [right] [no] problem 
B|81| g: [right so] we _just_ like take [the] line [down] vertically [down] [the] side [of the] page 
A|82| f: [yeah] _it's right_ [of] [where] [i] am _at the_ moment 
B|83| g: oh is [it] 
A|84| f: _past [the_ top [of] it] 
B|85| g: _and then_ [have] [you] [got] lost steps 
A|86| f: [up] _past [the_ [pine] tree] 
B|87| g: [no] [well] [yeah] slightly [to] its [right] [there's] some [stone slabs] 
A|88| f: [and] [i've] [and then] [where] [do] [i] [go] [after] [that] [to _the] old_ [lighthouse] 
B|89| g: _go [along_ the] side [of the] trout farm 
A|90| f: [yeah] 
B|91| g: [right] 
A|92| f: [just to] [below] [and] [to the right] [of the] outlaws' [hideout] [i've got a] gold mine 
B|93| g: [right] take [that] same line still [down] vertically [to _the] left_ [of the] ravine 
A|94| f: [right so] [out] [the] caravan park 
B|95| g: [and] turn [to] your [the] west 
A|96| f: [uh-huh] 
B|97| g: [i see] you'll [have] [to] [go] through [the] forest [then] 
A|98| f: [uh-huh] [right] 
B|99| g: 'til you've sort [of] curved [to the right] [then] [to _the] left_ [and then] back [out] [to the right] again 
A|100| f: i'm [just] i'm [just] [come down] 
B|101| g: [uh-huh] 
A|102| f: [right] i'm [in] [between] [the] remote village [and [the] pyramid] 
B|103| g: [and then] curve [it] back [in] [towards [the] old] light house [don't] [have] [a] cave 
A|104| f: [no] 
B|105| g: [right] [well] [it] doesn't doesn't matter 
A|106| f: [right okay]

A|120| f: [yeah] 
B|121| g: [uh-huh] 
A|122| f: [where] [do] [i] [end] [up] [in] relation [to the] [concealed hideout] 
B|123| g: like [you're going] over [the top] something [and then] coming back [down] [and] [going] under [the] fort 
A|124| f: [okay] [okay] [there] [you go] 
B|125| g: [mmhmm]

A|130| f: [uh-huh] [in [the] right] kind [of] [towards [the] middle] [a bit] 
B|131| g: [well] uh [i] think [you're] probably trying [to] avoid [that] [so] [if] [you go] [down] um [and then] [left] [in a] sort [of] curve 
A|132| f: [mmhmm] 
B|133| g: [just] [down] [at the] side [just] [straight] [down] 
A|134| f: [mmhmm] [right] _next to_ [it] 
B|135| g: turn [left] again 
A|136| f: [right so] [i] continue [and go] [below the] fast running [creek] 
B|137| g: [uh-huh] [uh-huh] 
A|138| f: [right so] [i] [go [along] [to] the right] 
B|139| g: [okay] moving [down] [all the] time 
A|140| f: [okay] 
B|141| g: [uh-huh] [have] [you] [got a] [pine] forest [on] [right] 
A|142| f: [aye] [got] [that] 
B|143| g: [right okay] [well] [you're [going] to] curve round them [right] [have] [you] [got] [the] flagship 
A|144| f: [mm] okey-dokey 
B|145| g: [well] [just] [at the] [the] footbridge [next to] when [you] [come] off [there's a] poisoned [stream] [so] when [you] [come] off [the] footbridge [you] [have] [to] [go] due south maybe about [an] inch [and] [a] half
