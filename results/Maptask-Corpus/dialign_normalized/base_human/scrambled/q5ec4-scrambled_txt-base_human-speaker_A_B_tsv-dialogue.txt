B|3| g: _well_ _you_ _turn left_ _so_ you're going [up] [the] map again 
A|4| f: _and_ it's _on_ _the left_ [well] i'm _coming_ _from _the_ left_ _to _go_ to_ _above_ _it_ 
B|5| g: aha _so_ _don't_ [go] round _the pine forest_ _just_ like pass _down_ by [it] 
A|6| f: _uh-huh_ _right_ _now_ _where_ 
B|7| g: _okay_ 
A|8| f: _right_ _that's_ [okay] 
B|9| g: um _do_ _you_ _have_ anything _between_ _this_ cattle stockade [and] [the] bandit territory 
A|10| f: [well] mine's _to the _right_ and_ _below_ [it] 
B|11| g: oh _two_ or three _inches_ _down_ [from _the] pine forest_ [okay] _you_ know [it] doesn't _have_ [to] be an arc as long as _you_ avoid all [the] obstacles [i] think [eh] if _you_ _you_ know if _you_ finish [up] [eh] _in_ line with [the] wheatfields [okay] _but_ _beneath the pine forest_ _you_ if _you_ stop drawing your line _there_ _above the_ bakery _in_ other words _above the_ [eh] 
A|12| f: _yeah_ 
B|13| g: [right _and] then_ follow [the] crane bay round [the] coast

A|28| f: [yeah] _okay so_ i'm i'm moving [right] basically 
B|29| g: [on] your map _no_ [well] [the] 
A|30| f: _i've_ _just _come_ down_ [there] 
B|31| g: _and then_ due west for _about two inches_ _uh_ _then_ 
A|32| f: [right] [so] it's [a] diagonal across _the page_ _towards_ [that] 
B|33| g: _okay _and_ then_ [just] like [a] nice big curve heading [down] _about_ six _inches_ 
A|34| f: [okay] 
B|35| g: [now] you're going _along_ 
A|36| f: _mmhmm_

A|44| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|45| g: [well] directly [above] them _maybe_ _about_ three quarters [of] an inch [above] [there] _is the_ start point 
A|46| f: erm [no] 
B|47| g: [uh-huh] 
A|48| f: wait [a] minute sure [i] [don't] [turn left] 
B|49| g: crane bay 
A|50| f: [and then go] [right] 
B|51| g: [mmhmm] until _you_ [just] get _past_ them [then] [come down] [to] them south 
A|52| f: [so] how far am [i] [from _the] left_ [of the page] 
B|53| g: [no] [i] _told_ _you_ _to [turn_ left] around [the] old abandoned cottage _you_ _turn right_ once _you_ went round [the] cottage 
A|54| f: [right] 
B|55| g: [right and] [see where] [the] pebbled shore _is_ 
A|56| f: [and then] [you] [told] me [to [turn] right] 
B|57| g: [right] _underneath it [and_ then] [just come] back [up] 'til you're level with [the] top [of the] plant thing _about_ [a] 
A|58| f: [mmhmm] i'm _well i've got_ [it] [at the] moment i'm slightly _below_ [it] [but] 
B|59| g: _do_ [you] _have_ an obstacle [there] 
A|60| f: [no] 
B|61| g: [right] [you] [well] [right] you're going _past_ you're going [up] over stone creek [and] your line's [just] _about_ touching [where] flat rocks _is_ written 
A|62| f: [uh] i'm nowhere _near_ [it] 
B|63| g: [so] you're _about_ an inch away [from the] _edge_ [of the] sheet [of] paper 
A|64| f: [i] [have] [come] across far enough [now] 
B|65| g: [the left] you've you've drawn [above] pebbled shore 
A|66| f: [is] [that] [beneath] [so] [is the] nose [to come] [beneath the pine forest] 
B|67| g: [right [okay] so] you're going [to] [in] [a] straight line [go] [go [to] the right] [have] [you] [got] [the] _ravine_ 
A|68| f: [uh-huh] [right okay] 
B|69| g: [no] 
A|70| f: [a bit] flatter what [on] [the] same does [this] [have] [have] [i] [to] _cross_ [a] stream

B|75| g: [but] [not] [don't] [go] [down] [just] [go] _along_ [don't] [go] [don't] [go] [down] [where] [it] [it] really curves away [there] [don't] [don't] follow [that] 
A|76| f: [yeah] 
B|77| g: [no] 
A|78| f: _okay right_ 
B|79| g: [turn left] [so] [that's] _two_ turns [left] after [you] [come] out _the caravan park_ 
A|80| f: er [about two inches] [maybe] [two] [and] [a] half 
B|81| g: [uh-huh] [and] [just] [the] [cross] [is] [right] [you] know [the] left-hand side [of the] lighthouse [just] next [to] [it]

B|91| g: [so] [you] want [to [come] down] [from the] mountain [and] [turn] sharp [left] 
A|92| f: [this] [edge] here 
B|93| g: [uh-huh] [so] [that's] over [the] top [of the] walled city 
A|94| f: [right] 
B|95| g: [edge] [of the] map 
A|96| f: [mmhmm] 
B|97| g: [right] [below] [the] pyramid there's [a] cobbled street [and] 
A|98| f: immediately [past] [the caravan park] 
B|99| g: [yeah] 
A|100| f: [right] hold [on] wait [a] minute am [i] [right] under [the] sandstone [cliffs] 
B|101| g: [right [okay] right] round [the] white water or [right] round [the] rapids 
A|102| f: [uh-huh] 
B|103| g: [and] [that's] [you] if [you] sort [of] curve off [to the left]
