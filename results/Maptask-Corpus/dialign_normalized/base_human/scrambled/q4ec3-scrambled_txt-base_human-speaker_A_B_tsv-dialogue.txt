A|64| f: _no i don't have_ _any_ trig points 
B|65| g: _eh_ take your line [down] [to] crane _bay_ _oh_ _i've got_ two wheatfields that's [not] important [is] _it right_ anyway [so] [you] [get] [to the] canal [right] [you] [don't have one] [but] [just] [go] [down] _about_ two _inches_ until [you] [get] [to] crane _bay_ [and] follow follow [the] curve [okay] [of] crane _bay_ 
A|66| f: [am i] [and] [am i] [going] [straight] kind [of] [along the] outline [of _the] bay_ 
B|67| g: [right] you've come [through] [the] _forest_
