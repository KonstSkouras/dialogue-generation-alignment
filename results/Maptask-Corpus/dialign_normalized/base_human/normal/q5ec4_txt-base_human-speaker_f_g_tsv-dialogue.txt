B|0| g: _right_ you start _at _the_ top_ _left_ 
A|1| f: [right] _oh_ _sorry_ _okay_ 
B|2| g: [right] _and_ eh _have_ you _got_ _cliffs_ _below_ _that_ _just below_ _and_ _to the_ [right] 
A|3| f: _yes_ 
B|4| g: _right so_ _go_ _down_ _just_ sort _of_ diagonally _just_ _towards_ _them_ _but_ _pass them_ 
A|5| f: _on the_ _the bottom_ _side of_ [them] _pass them _on_ _the_ bottom_ 
B|6| g: [pass them on] your their _left_ 
A|7| f: _on _the_ left_ 
B|8| g: uh-huh [right] _and then_ _have_ you _got_ _a_ forge underneath _the cliffs_ 
A|9| f: _no_ i've [just] [got] nothing _in_ _below the cliffs_ 
B|10| g: [oh] _have_ you [got] an _old_ _pine tree_ sort [of] _down_ diagonally [right] from [the cliffs] 
A|11| f: _yes_ 
B|12| g: [right] _well_ sort [of] _pretend_ _there's a_ forge [right] [below the cliffs] [right] _and_ instead [of] _right so_ you _go_ _down_ _round [the_ bottom] _of the_ forge _so_ like draw _a_ sort [of] _a pretend semicircle_ 
A|13| f: [a pretend semicircle] [to the] 
B|14| g: _well_ like you know [a pretend] loop 
A|15| f: _inside_ _or_ [the] aye [to _the] inside_ _or_ _the _outside of the_ map_ 
B|16| g: [right] start _right so_ you're _just below the cliffs_ 
A|17| f: i'm [just below the cliffs] 
B|18| g: _right so_ you _go_ _out_ _towards_ [outside of the map] 
A|19| f: _towards _the_ [outside of the_ map] [right] 
B|20| g: yeah _and then_ _round [the_ bottom] [of the] forge _which isn't there_ 
A|21| f: [which isn't there] 
B|22| g: _but_ _it's_ [on] _on the same_ level as _the pine tree_ 
A|23| f: _right okay_ 
B|24| g: [right] _and then_ you _go_ _up [the_ inside] _of the pine tree_ 
A|25| f: [the inside] 
B|26| g: [right] _not_ [no] _that_ _the left _of the pine_ tree_ _so_ [the] that's [outside of the map] 
A|27| f: _to [the left_ of the pine] 
B|28| g: uh-huh 
A|29| f: [up] _past [the_ pine tree] 
B|30| g: uh-huh 
A|31| f: [the pine tree] _is_ always [on] my [right] 
B|32| g: yeah 
A|33| f: _okay_ 
B|34| g: _and then_ _so_ you get [to _the] _top of the_ pine tree_ 
A|35| f: [top of the pine tree] 
B|36| g: [right] _and then_ _go_ _vertically across_ [to] about _two_ thirds _across the page_ 
A|37| f: [vertically across] 
B|38| g: horizontally [sorry] 
A|39| f: [right so] i'm _going_ [across the page] [right] 
B|40| g: uh-huh _have_ you [got] [a] _pine forest on_ [right] 
A|41| f: _yes_ 
B|42| g: _well_ you slope _down_ with _the _pine forest_ on_ your [right] 
A|43| f: [pine forest on] my [right] 
B|44| g: aha [so] _don't_ _go_ _round _the_ pine forest_ [just] like [pass] _down_ by _it_ 
A|45| f: [so] i'm cut _right okay_ 
B|46| g: _"right_ _and then_ [just] _where_ [the] word [pine forest] [is] _just stop at the_ ""p""" 
A|47| f: ["right] [right] [stop at the] ""p"" right" 
B|48| g: [right] _and then_ sort [of] loop _round_ [a] wee _bit_ more _don't_ _don't_ draw your line _in _the_ same_ angle sort [of] make _it_ _a bit flatter_ _and then_ draw another wee loop 
A|49| f: [a bit flatter] _what_ [on the same] does _this_ [have] [have] _i_ [to] cross _a stream_ 
B|50| g: [what] 
A|51| f: [have] _i_ [to] cross _a stream_ 
B|52| g: _no i_ haven't [got] [a stream] [i] suppose [just] avoid [the] [stream] _but_ sort [of] like as though 
A|53| f: [it] runs 
B|54| g: you're drawing [a] _nose_ [right] say [this] _is the_ face you're drawing _and then_ you've [got] [to] sort [of] _do_ [a] sort [of] _round_ [bit] for _the nose_ 
A|55| f: _is that_ _beneath_ [so] [is [the] nose] [to] _come_ _beneath the pine forest_ 
B|56| g: [beneath the pine forest] uh-huh 
A|57| f: _okay_ [right] 
B|58| g: [right] [have] you [got] [a] _bakery_ underneath [right] [a bit] lower _down_ 
A|59| f: _yes_ 
B|60| g: [right so] see when [the nose] _comes_ _out_ [it] _comes back in_ [to the] face 
A|61| f: [comes back in] _yes_ 
B|62| g: [right] [that] should be [just] above _the bakery_ 
A|63| f: [right] 
B|64| g: [is that] [okay] 
A|65| f: [okay] 
B|66| g: _and then_ _go_ _and_ _do_ another big [nose] _round the bakery_ 
A|67| f: [round the bakery] 
B|68| g: uh-huh _and then_ [come] [right] [back in] 
A|69| f: [okay] 
B|70| g: underneath [the bakery] _and_ maybe [in] [past [the] bakery] about _two centimetres_ [just] before [the] _canal_ [have] you [got] _a canal_ 
A|71| f: [no i] _don't have [a_ canal] 
B|72| g: all [right] [right] [just] [come] [in] _two centimetres_ [towards the] middle 
A|73| f: [okay] 
B|74| g: from [the bakery] 
A|75| f: [right] 
B|76| g: ["right] _and then_ are you sort [of] above [the] ""e"" [in] crane bay" 
A|77| f: _yes_ 
B|78| g: [right] _well_ _go_ _down_ [towards the] coast 
A|79| f: alright 
B|80| g: [right] _and then_ follow [the] crane bay [round the] coast 
A|81| f: [okay] what's [the] direction 
B|82| g: "to [the] [to the left] _it's_ [towards the] ""c"" [of] crane bay" 
A|83| f: [okay] [right] 
B|84| g: [right] _and_ eh _then_ _it's_ sort [of] [have] you [got] wheatfields 
A|85| f: _yes_ [but] they're [up [the] top] 
B|86| g: [oh] you [got] _a rocket warehouse_ 
A|87| f: _yes_ [i] _have [a_ rocket warehouse] 
B|88| g: mm [right okay] [is that] sort [of] above [the] _lighthouse_ 
A|89| f: _yes_ 
B|90| g: [right] _well_ sort [of] sticking [to the] coast you know _where_ [the] coast goes [up] _and_ _down_ vertical 
A|91| f: _yes_ 
B|92| g: [right] sort [of] [don't] _go_ [vertically] _down_ [it] [but] start sloping _down_ [towards] _around the top of the rocket warehouse_ 
A|93| f: [around the top of the rocket warehouse] 
B|94| g: uh-huh 
A|95| f: [right okay] 
B|96| g: _and then_ slope [the] line _right out to the side of the page_ 
A|97| f: [right out to the side of the page] 
B|98| g: uh-huh 
A|99| f: [right] 
B|100| g: [the outside [of the] page] _and then_ eh sort [of] draw [a] are you about [in] line with [the rocket] [bit] [or] [have] you done [that] 
A|101| f: [no] i'm [past [the] rocket] 
B|102| g: [no] [but] like see _where_ your line [is] [at [the] side of the page] [is that] [at] [rocket] like _where_ [the] words [rocket] are written 
A|103| f: [oh] aye near enough 
B|104| g: [right so] we [just] like take [the] line _down_ [vertically] _down the side of the page_ 
A|105| f: [down the side of the page] 
B|106| g: for about _two centimetres_ 
A|107| f: [right] 
B|108| g: _and then_ curve [it] [back in] [towards _the] old_ light house [don't have _a] cave_ 
A|109| f: [past the] [cave] [well] [there's [a] cave] [in] between [the rocket warehouse] [and] _the old lighthouse_ 
B|110| g: you [going] [to] hit [it] 
A|111| f: _yes_ if [i] [go] [in] [so] i'll [come] [down] further than [the] [two centimetres] 
B|112| g: [okay] 
A|113| f: [and] [go] [past] [down] [below the] [cave] 
B|114| g: [yes] yeah [oh] will [that] put you _in the sea_ 
A|115| f: [no] [it's] [not] [in the sea] 
B|116| g: [okay] _then_ 
A|117| f: [and] i've [and then] [where] [do] [i] [go] after [that] [to _the] old lighthouse_ 
B|118| g: _just stop at the old lighthouse_ uh-huh 
A|119| f: [just stop at the old lighthouse] [okay]
