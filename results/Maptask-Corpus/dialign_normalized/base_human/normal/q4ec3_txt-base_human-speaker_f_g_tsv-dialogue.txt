B|0| g: _right_ _ehm_ you've _got_ _to_ take your line _down_ _from the_ start _to_ _just_ vertically _to_ _just_ _to the left of burnt forest_ 
A|1| f: [to the left of burnt forest] 
B|2| g: _mmhmm_ 
A|3| f: _so it's_ _not_ _far down_ 
B|4| g: _no_ [it's] _a_ tiny bit _okay_ _and_ while you're doing that _go_ in [to] your _right_ _a_ bit _but_ _it_ doesn't really matter _okay_ _ehm_ _have_ _you_ _got_ _a_ _ravine_ 
A|5| f: _yeah_ 
B|6| g: _right_ take that same line still [down] vertically [to _the left of] the ravine_ 
A|7| f: _there's a_ _cottage_ _on my map_ 
B|8| g: _well_ _just_ _draw round_ _it_ 
A|9| f: [the left of the ravine] 
B|10| g: _uh-huh_ _is_ _the cottage_ in [the] way _there_ _no_ 
A|11| f: [it's] _next_ [to [the] ravine] 
B|12| g: _well_ _that's_ _okay_ _right_ now take that take [the] line _is_ _the cottage_ directly beside [the ravine]

A|21| f: [mmhmm] 
B|22| g: between [the cottage] [and] [the ravine] 
A|23| f: _i've_ [just] _come down_ [there] 
B|24| g: _you_ weren't meant [to] 
A|25| f: [right] 
B|26| g: _okay_ [right] _you_ _went_ _down past_ [burnt forest]

B|36| g: [past [the] cottage] 
A|37| f: [and _then] go right_ 
B|38| g: [then go right] _underneath [the_ cottage] 
A|39| f: [uh-huh] 
B|40| g: [go] up [through] between [the cottage] [and] [the ravine] 'til [you] get [to] stop [just] above [the ravine]

B|52| g: [a pine grove] [uh-huh] 
A|53| f: [uh-huh] 
B|54| g: [i] want [you] [to] [draw] [the] line keep going [to] your [right] _okay_ [so] you're sort [of] _like_ drawing towards [the] top [of _the] pine grove_ [then] stop [and] [go] _from_ [left] [to] [right] in _a diagonal_ _underneath the pine grove_ 
A|55| f: [a diagonal] 
B|56| g: _from_ _from the_ top [of the ravine] [to] _underneath the pine grove_ 
A|57| f: [so it's] [like] diagonally [down] 
B|58| g: [uh-huh] _okay_ [and then] _do you_ _have_ anything [underneath] [pine grove] 
A|59| f: _avalanche_ 
B|60| g: mm _is_ that [just] [right] beneath [it]

B|62| g: _do you_ _have_ _concealed hideout_ 
A|63| f: [yeah] [it's] [that's] [underneath _the] avalanche_ 
B|64| g: _okay_ [right] [i] [that's] fine [right] [i] want [you] _to go_ [draw] [to] your [to] your [right] under _the pine grove_ avoiding [the avalanche] 
A|65| f: [underneath the pine grove] 
B|66| g: [uh-huh] 
A|67| f: [down] _or_ 
B|68| g: can [you] [go] between [the pine grove] [and] [the avalanche] 
A|69| f: [uh-huh] 
B|70| g: [to] get [past] [it] [yeah] [well] [draw] that way 
A|71| f: _down [to_ _the] concealed hideout_ 
B|72| g: [not] [not] completely [down] [just] get _past the avalanche_ [right] 
A|73| f: [past the avalanche] 
B|74| g: [and then] _ehm_ eventually [i] want [you] _to go_ [round] [concealed hideout] 
A|75| f: [right] 
B|76| g: _okay_

A|101| f: [no] 
B|102| g: good [right] imagine you've [got] [a] [boat house] [to [the left [of] the] concealed hideout] [right] [do you] see where in can [you] see crane _bay_ 
A|103| f: [mmhmm] 
B|104| g: [do you] see where [there's] where [the] coastline comes [round] [it's] um [there's a] sort [of] [like] jutting out bit [there's] [like] [a] point 
A|105| f: [yeah] 
B|106| g: [just] [underneath] [concealed hideout] 
A|107| f: [mmhmm] 
B|108| g: [or] [just] _to the right of_ [it] _okay_ [i] want [you] [to] [you] see where [it] comes _down like_ that 
A|109| f: [mmhmm] 
B|110| g: [well] [i] want [you] [to] follow follow [the] line [of the] _the coast_ [there] [so] [draw] [from] [concealed hideout] vertically downwards 'til [you] [come] [to] that jutting out bit [of the] coastline [then] until until [on] that incline [draw] [you] know follow [the] line [of _the] coast_ [but] [don't] [don't] [go] [on] [to] crane _bay_ until [you] [come] [to the] [the] [next] bit that comes up _okay_ stop [there] 
A|111| f: [mmhmm] [mmhmm] 
B|112| g: [right] [do you] [have] _ehm_ coconut palm [to] your [left]

A|117| f: [mmhmm] 
B|118| g: [right] [so] imagine you've [got] [a] tree [there] [and] [i] want [you] [to] [draw] between where that tree [would] be where _the pebbled shore_ [is] [so] [just] keep drawing [go] make your line _go down_ [a] bit [right] [and] [just] [to] [come] [to] above _pebbled shore_ [and] [just] stop [the end] [there] [and then] _ehm_ [i don't] suppose you've [got] finished marked [on] your [map] [no] [right] [have] [you] [got] anything _below pebbled shore_ 
A|119| f: _washed stones_ 
B|120| g: [well] 
A|121| f: [and] _flagship and_ [bay] 
B|122| g: [right] see see where [the] [flagship] [is] 
A|123| f: [mmhmm] 
B|124| g: [right] [and] see where _the pebbled shore_ [is] 
A|125| f: [mmhmm]

A|127| f: [mmhmm] [yeah] 
B|128| g: sort [of] see where that [is] [right] imagine _the finish_ [is] [there] [draw] roughly [down to] [there] 
A|129| f: [ehm] bypassing [pebbled shore] 
B|130| g: [it] [would] be [just] [just] [near] [mmhmm] [but] [you] [just] [right] _near [the_ end of the page] 
A|131| f: [so i] [just] [go [down] [to] the right of] [pebbled shore] 
B|132| g: [yeah] [uh-huh] 
A|133| f: [uh-huh and] [down like] 
B|134| g: [no] [no] [not] [to the right] 
A|135| f: [the right] as [you] face [the] [map] 
B|136| g: [no] 
A|137| f: [well] what side [then] 
B|138| g: [the left] you've you've drawn above [pebbled shore] 
A|139| f: [uh-huh] 
B|140| g: [well] [just] [draw] in [a diagonal] [to] your [left] 
A|141| f: [to [the] end of the page] 
B|142| g: [mmhmm right] quite [far down] 
A|143| f: [and then] [down] 
B|144| g: [and then]

B|146| g: [well] [i] want [you] [to] avoid that 
A|147| f: [uh-huh] [so i] [go] [underneath the] beach [the pebbled shore] again 
B|148| g: [and] [go] [uh-huh] [no] [well] [i don't] know where's your where's your [washed stones] 
A|149| f: [it's] [below pebbled shore] [to the left] 
B|150| g: [well] [that's] _okay_ [just] [draw round] [it] [and] [past] [it] 
A|151| f: [to the left] [yeah] 
B|152| g: [yeah] 
A|153| f: [and then] [that's] [the finish] 
B|154| g: [and then] [the finish] [is] [just] [ehm] [on] [a] horizontal with [the] [flagship] [near] [to _the] coast_ about [a] centimetre away [from _the] coast_ 
A|155| f: [near [the] coast] 
B|156| g: [mmhmm] 
A|157| f: [right] [there] 
B|158| g: _okay_ 
A|159| f: [okay] 
B|160| g: [is] that [just] beside [the] [flagship] [yeah] 
A|161| f: [mmhmm] 
B|162| g: [okay] 
A|163| f: [i] bet they're totally different
