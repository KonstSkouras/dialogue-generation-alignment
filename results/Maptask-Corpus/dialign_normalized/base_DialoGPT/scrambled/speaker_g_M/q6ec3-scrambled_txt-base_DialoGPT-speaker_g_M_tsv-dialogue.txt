A|1| M: ok , i'll try _that_ 
B|2| g: _no_ _do you have_ pebbled shore 
A|3| M: _right_ till _you get_ _a little bit_ _of_ elevation 
B|4| g: that's [right]

B|6| g: _so_ ehm ehm _i'm_ kind [of] stuck 
A|7| M: _you know_ , _the right_ _of the_ pines 
B|8| g: [right] well _go_ _down_ towards [the] coast 
A|9| M: [so] how many times _have you_ done _this_ 
B|10| g: _okay_ 
A|11| M: goin _for the_ _bay_ 
B|12| g: [right] [so] see _when_ [the] nose comes out _it_ comes back _in_ _to the_ face 
A|13| M: _i think_ _it's_ _the top of_ _stone creek_ _and_ _the top_ [right] [of] stonecreek 
B|14| g: uh we turn _right there_ _at_ [that] bulge _okay_ since [you] _don't_ _have a_ trig point we'll use [that] instead 
A|15| M: [yeah] , _what_ _about_ [it] ? 
B|16| g: _okay_ _if_ [you] _just_ [get] _to the_ waterfall first [and] then [you] want _to go_ straight _up to_ _where_ these lost steps _are_ 
A|17| M: _i don't_ _know_ [where] [i'm] _going_ _from_ here 
B|18| g: ehm straight _down_ [from] [that] [have you] got an actual wee [bay] _there_ _like_ curves 
A|19| M: [i'm] not sure , _i think_ _i_ [have _a] graveyard_ , _but_ _i don't_ _know_ _for_ sure 
B|20| g: [right] you've come through [the] forest 
A|21| M: _i_ am 
B|22| g: [right] take [the] line _and _go_ to_ your [right] underneath [the] cottage _can_ [you] _do that_ 
A|23| M: yea sure 
B|24| g: underneath _draw a_ line _to_ your [right] [and] straight along _at_ [a] slight angle rising _up_ towards [the] back [of the] corner [of the] page 
A|25| M: [i'm] _on_ 
B|26| g: you've got [a] lake _now_ [you] skirt around [the] inside side [of the] lake that's side [of the] lake _that is_ nearest _to _the_ middle of the_ map 
A|27| M: uhhhh ... _yes_ . 
B|28| g: [i think] _you're_ _on the_ wrong _one_ 
A|29| M: [no] _its_ [just] [a] regular _ravine_ [that] [i] built 
B|30| g: [you] got another [stone creek] 
A|31| M: _right _where_ the_ bridge ends 
B|32| g: _are you_ 
A|33| M: uhh _what_ ? 
B|34| g: _and you_ want _to _go to_ the_ sort [of] midpoint [of the] rift valley [you] want _to_ intersect _in the_ midpoint [of the] rift valley [going] _down_ [the] _way_ _do [you_ _know] what_ _i mean_ 
A|35| M: how high [are you] ? 
B|36| g: mm 
A|37| M: _it's_ fine . [i] [just] [don't] [like] [to] be caught [in [the] middle of] [a] river [when] [i'm] [on the] foot bridge

A|39| M: _yes_ touching 
B|40| g: _okay_ [i] want [you] _go_ _down_ [about] three inches 
A|41| M: yea im fine 
B|42| g: [right] [you] [just] want [to] curve _up the_ left-hand side [of the] fort [just] curve [a] nice big curve _round_ [it] 
A|43| M: oh [yeah] 
B|44| g: [about] [a] centimetre [from] [where] [it] says cliffs _to the_ left-hand side _of it_ _okay_ then [you] _go_ back _left_ slightly until _you're_ beneath [the] [the] _start_ [and] _down_ [you know] _two_ _or_ three inches until _you're_ 
A|45| M: [i think] i've found [a] goldmine 
B|46| g: edge [of the] map 
A|47| M: [and [you] have] [to _go] north_ _for_ [a] mile [to _the] north_ 
B|48| g: aye 
A|49| M: [you] wanna [go] [round] [up] 
B|50| g: [right] _okay_ [so] _you're_ [going] [to] [in] [a] straight line [go] _go to [the_ right] [have you] got [the] [ravine] 
A|51| M: _i don't_ [know what] [you're] talking [about] . 
B|52| g: [you] turn [round] [to] [a] abandoned cottage [so] always keeping _it on_ your left-hand side 
A|53| M: [and you] [can] [do] [it on] [a] wooden board [and] _it's_ [a] _very_ quick [and] easy 
B|54| g: [and] then [so] [you get] [to [the] top [of] the] pine _tree_ 
A|55| M: [yeah] ... 
B|56| g: uh-huh _okay_ [so] [don't] [go] as _far_ as [the] pine grove 
A|57| M: [like] _where are you_ [going] ? 
B|58| g: _okay_ 
A|59| M: oh [yeah] , [i] did [that] [right] 
B|60| g: before [you] reach [the] fort 
A|61| M: [where] _is the_ _little_ blue circle _at the_ bottom [right] ? 
B|62| g: [i] [i don't] suppose you've got [a graveyard] [have you] 
A|63| M: i'll [do] [it] , _but_ i'll [have] [to go to] work [now] 
B|64| g: [and] _do you have a_ remote village

B|66| g: [is] [that] _okay_ 
A|67| M: _its_ not [a] minecraft server 
B|68| g: [so] [you're] trying [to] avoid [that] _so go_ _down [a_ little bit] 'til [just] underneath [where the] indian country [is] 
A|69| M: [i don't] [know what] [to] [do] [now] 
B|70| g: ah there's [no] lemon grove [in] [this] _one_ 
A|71| M: [yeah] [i think] [so] 
B|72| g: [right] _start_ [right] [so] [you're] [just] below [the] cliffs 
A|73| M: [you] [can] [just] [go to the] bottom [and you] [can] [do] [the] final finish 
B|74| g: [right [where] are you] [now] then 
A|75| M: [the] banana [tree] [is] [there] 
B|76| g: [but] [you know] beneath [the] _start_ 
A|77| M: _you should_ [start] [a] thread 
B|78| g: [you're] [going] [to go] [and] [you're] [going] [to] come [right] through [you're] [going] [to] [like] intersect [right] almost [at the] midpoint [of the] rift valley 
A|79| M: [i'm] [in the] _east_ 
B|80| g: [and] then [go to] your [right] 
A|81| M: [so] [just] stop [right there]
