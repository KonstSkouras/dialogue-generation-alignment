B|0| f: _right_ start _from_ _the_ cross _yeah_ 
A|1| M: can _you_ give _me_ _a_ rough estimate _of the_ distance ? 
B|2| f: _it's_ directly _down_ _yeah_ 
A|3| M: _i_ _have_ one . 
B|4| f: mm no [i] haven't _got_ any _wagon wheel_ 
A|5| M: _do you_ _have_ _the diamond_ ? 
B|6| f: _to the right_ _i've got_ eventually [a] _cactus_ 
A|7| M: _i've got a_ wooden rock _to the left_ 
B|8| f: _oh_ [i've got _a] rift valley_ _above_ _that_ 
A|9| M: _it's a_ [wagon wheel] . 
B|10| f: you've [got] _the rift valley_ _right up_ _at the top_ right-hand _side_ 
A|11| M: _i've got it_ , _but_ _i'm not_ sure _what_ _i'm_ _doing_ 
B|12| f: mmhmm 
A|13| M: [i] _don't know what_ you're talking _about_ 
B|14| f: towards [the] right-hand _corner_ 
A|15| M: under _what_ [corner] ? 
B|16| f: ehm _that's_ _going to_ _take_ [me] pretty near _to the cactus thing_ _so_ [i'm] trying _to avoid_ _that_ 
A|17| M: _if you_ _go_ [to the cactus thing] _you_ can get _it on [the_ right] hand [corner] 
B|18| f: hang [on] hang [on] [right] _an_ inch _to the right of [the_ diamond] _mine_ 
A|19| M: [right] _side [of_ the] cacti ? 
B|20| f: _yeah and then_ _straight_ _down to_ _an_ inch _below_ [it] 
A|21| M: [yeah] [i] _know what_ [that] _is_ , _i was_ _just_ curious 
B|22| f: [yeah] 
A|23| M: they arent really , _you_ _should_ probably _be_ ok 
B|24| f: _okay_ [to] _right [to_ the] edge [of _the] page_ 
A|25| M: ok [then] _go_ _left_ _and go_ [right] 
B|26| f: er [right] _okay_ [that] takes [me] [to] 
A|27| M: _go_ [right to] [page] 
B|28| f: _okay_ 
A|29| M: okays [i] will _go_ [to] [page] 3 [and then] [page] 4 
B|30| f: _okay_ hang [on] 
A|31| M: ok _now_ [the page] _is_ _back_ [up] 
B|32| f: _have _you_ got_ _the rift valley_ _there_ 'cause [i've got] _the rift valley_ _right up_ _in_ [that] _top_ right-hand [corner] 
A|33| M: [i] can _do_ [that] 
B|34| f: [yeah] 
A|35| M: [have] u ever gotten _through the_ rifts ? 
B|36| f: [right] [go] [through the] centre _i'll_ [just] _take it_ [up] [and go] [through the] centre [yeah] 
A|37| M: _okay so_ you're _not_ [going to] get past [the rift] ? 
B|38| f: [right] [okay] erm [i'm not] [that] [so] _i should_ [be] _below_ _there_ when [i'm] taking _the line_ [up] 
A|39| M: you're [not] getting past [me] 
B|40| f: [okay] [right] 
A|41| M: _i'm going [to_ _the] bottom_ 
B|42| f: _i'll have to_ _i'll_ _i'll have to_ kind [of] change [it] slightly 'cause [i've] taken [it on the] wrong [side of] this [cactus thing] _i think_ _i'll_ [just] _do a_ slight detour [right] [and] [just] _take _it_ straight_ [through] towards _the top of [the_ page] 
A|43| M: ok [just] [so] _you know_ , you're [right] 
B|44| f: _alright_ _there_ we [go] 
A|45| M: [i think] [i should] [have] _done [it_ straight] [up] _but_ [it's] [up] [to] [you] 
B|46| f: _not quite_ 
A|47| M: [that's] _what i_ said 
B|48| f: [was] [i] 
A|49| M: [you got] [me] [there] 
B|50| f: [right] mm [that's] [not] _where_ [i] am [now] [right] [so] _where_ hang [on] [right] [so] 
A|51| M: [it's] _in [the_ rift] valleys 
B|52| f: [yeah] [in] [a] like _as_ [the] two ends _are_ pointing [up] towards _top of [the_ page] 
A|53| M: [i] [have] [a rift valley] 
B|54| f: [right] [and] _i was supposed_ [to] start _above it_ [there] [and] _come_ _down_ [through] [it] 
A|55| M: [i was supposed] , [i'm] _in the middle_ [of [the] rift valley] 
B|56| f: well [i've] [done it] [back] [to] front [but] never mind [right] eh [so] [i should] [now] [be] _below_ [it] 
A|57| M: _its_ [a] little more complicated than [that] 
B|58| f: [yeah] 
A|59| M: [yeah] [i] [do] 
B|60| f: erm no [i've got] [the] rocks [i've got] like two rocks 
A|61| M: [so] _do you want_ [to] trade ? 
B|62| f: _and again a_ couple [of] _inches below_ [that] [i've got] outlaws' hideout 
A|63| M: uhh ... [and again a] few [inches _below] the_ water 
B|64| f: [but] [i] haven't _got anything_ else round [about] [that] area 
A|65| M: you're [right] . [i'll have to] [do] [that] 
B|66| f: er [right] over [i've got] _rapids_ [about] three [inches] across _from_ [the] rocks 
A|67| M: [i've got _a] _bit_ of_ dirt around [the top of the] rock [and] [it's] [not quite] [as] nice [as] [that] 
B|68| f: [through the] centre [of the] two rocks 
A|69| M: _is_ [that] [where] _the rapids_ [are] ? 
B|70| f: [right] [okay so] [is] [it] well [okay] _alright_ [i think] [i've got] this [the] first _part_ [of] this [is] [a] total state 
A|71| M: we're [on [the] top of the] hill 
B|72| f: er well that'll [be] [the rapids] 
A|73| M: [okay] cool [i'll] try [to] get some [of _the] other_ stuff [done] 
B|74| f: no [i've got] 
A|75| M: [okay] ok _do you_ [have] [a] white water [above] _your_ rock _creek_ ? 
B|76| f: [i've got] [the] swamp [and] like directly _above [the_ rapids] [i've got a] [diamond] _mine_ 
A|77| M: [i'll] [take] [the] white water . 
B|78| f: [but] [you know] [right] [right] [back] _at the_ start 
A|79| M: [the] best [part] [is] [the] water 
B|80| f: nope 
A|81| M: _you mean_ [to the] rapian's [right] ? 
B|82| f: am [i] [going] [above] or [below] here _at the moment_ [i'm] _at_ _at the moment_ [i'm] [just] slightly [to the left] [of the] rocks 
A|83| M: [it's] [the] opposite 
B|84| f: [so] where's [where] [do] [i] _go from there_ 
A|85| M: [at the moment] im _just [to_ the right of the] rock 
B|86| f: taking [it] round _from_ [the top] or 
A|87| M: _what_ [are] [you] _doing_ ? 
B|88| f: [right] [okay] [right] [so] [i'm] [now] _at the top_ left-hand [corner] [of [the] rapids] 
A|89| M: theres [a] few [of] _them_ , _and the_ one with [the] giant white [thing] [on the] ground 
B|90| f: _oh_ [i] see [what] [you mean] [yeah] 
A|91| M: [i think] [you mean] [that] they will [come] [to the] rapades , [but] stay [there] for [a] while 
B|92| f: _have [you_ [got] a] manned _fort_ [below [the] rapids] 
A|93| M: _i mean_ [you] can [just] walk [up] [to the] rapid [and] [take it] [and go] [up] [to] their encampment 
B|94| f: 'cause [i've got] [that] interrupting er like almost directly [below] [it] slightly [to the left] [i've got a] manned _fort_ 
A|95| M: [you know] you're gonna [have to] make [a] [fort] with [that] [line] , [right] ? 
B|96| f: eh _oh_ [right] 
A|97| M: [i think] [i] [have] [a] _stone creek_ , [i'll] check later 
B|98| f: _yeah _it's_ right_ [the] _way_ _down_ [below the] manned [fort] _have you_ [not] _got anything_ [in] _between_ [the rapids] [and _the] [stone_ creek] _down_ [at [the] bottom] 
A|99| M: [it's [right] up] [the] hill , there's [a] [stone creek] [above it] 
B|100| f: [yeah] no [in] [right] [in] _between_ [the] two [of] those [i've got a] manned [fort] 
A|101| M: [it's right] [above the] minecraft [fort] _in [the_ bottom] [left] [corner] , [the] one with [the] rock [and the] rock monster . 
B|102| f: er [about] two [inches] maybe two _and a_ half 
A|103| M: how far [down] ? 
B|104| f: _the [stone_ creek] [and _the] stone_ slabs 
A|105| M: what's [the] difference [between] [a] [stone] [and a] slab ? 
B|106| f: which _way_ [do you want] [me] [to] [go] round [the left] or [the] right-hand [side of] [that] 
A|107| M: [go] [go] [go] [go] 
B|108| f: [right] [okay] 
A|109| M: [i think] [it's] _the other_ [way] around 
B|110| f: [right] [so] [it's a] diagonal across [the page] towards [that] 
A|111| M: [yeah and then] [it's] [an] angle [so] [you] can get [the] horizontal [line] 
B|112| f: [that] sounds [a bit] drastic [right] 
A|113| M: theres [a] small [line] [at the top] [that] goes [down [to] the] end [of [the] line] , [so] [you] can [go from there] [to the right] 
B|114| f: [yeah] _have [you_ [got] a] _gold mine_ [there] [as] well [just] 
A|115| M: yes , [i'm] _in the_ same place 
B|116| f: [just to] [below] [and] [to the right of the] outlaws' hideout [i've got a] _gold mine_ 
A|117| M: [alright] thanks 
B|118| f: [i'm going to] [be] [quite] wealthy [i've got] all [the] mines 
A|119| M: [you [got] anything] [to] trade ? 
B|120| f: erm no 
A|121| M: can [you] [be] _my_ friend ? 
B|122| f: er [i've got a] saloon _bar_ [right] [down] [on the] left-hand [side] 
A|123| M: u [got a] palace [bar] ? 
B|124| f: short cut [yeah] 
A|125| M: [i think] [i'm] gonna [go] with [a] little more than [that] . 
B|126| f: mmhmm [i'm] well [i've got it] [at the moment] [i'm] slightly [below] [it] [but] 
A|127| M: [oh] god , [you] [have] [a] [bar] ? 
B|128| f: [yeah] 
A|129| M: [have you] found [anything] ? 
B|130| f: "not directly [below] [it] [just] [just] [below the] ""u"" [if you] [take it] [down] [from] [the] hideout er [that] [that's] [just] [that's] [just] [at the] left-hand side" 
A|131| M: what's [the] best [way] [to] get [it] [to] show [up] ? 
B|132| f: [but] [are] _your stone_ slabs [not] kind [of] [at [the] other] [side of] [that] 
A|133| M: yea , [i was] [going to] [do a] cave , [but] [the] whole [thing] [was] too much 
B|134| f: 'cause [my] [stone] slabs [are] like maybe [what] two [and a] half [inches below] [and] [to the left] 
A|135| M: why [is] [your stone] [on [the] other] end [of the] block ? 
B|136| f: _the gold mine_ [is] 
A|137| M: [i think] [it's] [just [to] [the] other] end [of the] block 
B|138| f: mm aye directly [above the] _noose_ [that's] [a] better _description_ 
A|139| M: [i] _don't_ [think] [the gold mine] [of] [gold] [is] [the] best [description] for [a] [stone] . 
B|140| f: [on] [its] right-hand [side] 
A|141| M: [it's] [on [the] right] hand [side] 
B|142| f: [so] [that's] like towards [the] edge [of the] paper here 
A|143| M: [its] [a] [noose] 
B|144| f: [right] [there] we [go] [i've] [come] [right] [down] [below] [that] 
A|145| M: [right] [where] [it] [is] 
B|146| f: [i've got] [the] saloon [bar] [and] [i've got] _the [stone_ creek] directly across [to the left] [of the] [noose] er [but] [i've got] nothing else [in] [that] area [at] all 
A|147| M: [the] salt water [line] [is] [down [to] [the] bottom] [of the] ocean . 
B|148| f: [you know] like [below] [that] [i should] _say_ [i mean] [in the] [in the middle] [and] [to] [above] [them] [and _the] stone_ slabs 
A|149| M: [the stone] wall 
B|150| f: mmhmm 
A|151| M: [so] , [where] [is] [the] saloons [bar] ? 
B|152| f: [right] [so] [i've] _to avoid_ [that] 
A|153| M: [yeah it's] called [the] ocean 
B|154| f: [so] [go] [above it] 
A|155| M: [yeah] , [i think] [i'm] gonna try [to avoid] [it] 
B|156| f: _phoar_ 
A|157| M: what's [your] favorite type [of] hotdog ? 
B|158| f: [that's] [it] [yeah] 
A|159| M: [i think] [you mean] [phoar] . 
B|160| f: [what] [the] first [bit of] [that] [was] [a] total disaster 
A|161| M: yeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhh ... you're [not] alone 
B|162| f: 'cause [i] came [through [the] rift valley] [the] wrong [way] [i was supposed] [to] [come] [from] [the top] [and go] [down] 'til like [down] [through] [it] 
A|163| M: why [do you] [say] [that] ? 
B|164| f: 'cause [i] well [i] came [from] underneath [don't know [what] [i] was] [doing] [down] [there]
