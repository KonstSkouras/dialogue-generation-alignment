A|0| M: _what_ size _diamond mine_ _are_ _you_ mining ? 
B|1| g: 'til _it's_ 'til _it's_ _an_ inch below _the [diamond_ mine] _right_ _do you have a_ 
A|2| M: [the] only _thing_ _i_ can think _of_ _is_ [the diamond] mining part 
B|3| g: _yeah_ _do you have a_ _a wagon_ wheel _just_ _to the right of the_ [the [diamond] mine] 
A|4| M: [yeah] _i_ _know_ _i_ can't afford [a wagon] [right] _now_ _but_ _i_ could [do] _it_ _in_ [a] few hours 
B|5| g: _what's the_ next [thing] _to_ _its_ [right] 
A|6| M: _yeah _i've got_ a_ [diamond mine] , _and_ [it's] _in [the_ diamond] mines 
B|7| g: _you don't_ _have a_ _rift valley_ 
A|8| M: _i_ [have] [the] same problem . 
B|9| g: [yeah] _okay_ 
A|10| M: [yeah] _i_ guess youre [right] 
B|11| g: you're drawing _your_ _line_ _down_ 
A|12| M: _i_ am _not_ sure _how_ _i_ can _get_ _it_ _on _the_ _top_ of_ _my_ _head_ 
B|13| g: underneath draw [a] _line_ _to_ _your_ [right] [and] straight _along_ _at_ [a] slight angle rising _up_ towards [the] _back_ _of the_ _corner _of_ the_ page 
A|14| M: [what's _the] line_ ? 
B|15| g: [yeah] 
A|16| M: _i mean_ ... [do _you] mean_ _on [the_ right] hand _side_ ? 
B|17| g: [right] 
A|18| M: [the] cactus ? 
B|19| g: [yeah] 
A|20| M: [do you have a] _way_ [to] tell _how far_ _it_ _is_ ? 
B|21| g: should _be_ [now] [yeah] _if_ _your_ line's below [the [diamond] mine] [you] should _be_ _okay_ 
A|22| M: i'll try _that_ 
B|23| g: _and then_ _go_ straight _along_ [to] [my] [right] _which_ [is] _your_ [right] as _well_ _go_ straight _along_ _to the right_ 
A|24| M: [yeah] , [yeah] , [yeah] . 
B|25| g: _no_ [to] about halfway [to] page about four inches off before [the] page 
A|26| M: _yes_ _to the left of the_ center [of the] screen 
B|27| g: _then_ _go up_ [to] almost [the] very _top of the_ page 
A|28| M: ok , _how far_ [do] _i_ _need to go_ ? 
B|29| g: [right] _and then_ [to] _your_ [right] again 
A|30| M: [right] [now] 
B|31| g: _well_ [but] 
A|32| M: _yes_ [and then] 
B|33| g: [yeah] you're _going to_ actually [go] _through_ _the rift valley_ like _the rift_ valley's like [a] half moon 
A|34| M: [the _rift valley] is_ [the rift] river 
B|35| g: you're _going [to_ go] [and] you're _going to_ come [right] _through_ you're _going to_ like intersect [right] almost _at the_ midpoint _of the rift valley_ 
A|36| M: [yeah] _i_ think _so_ 
B|37| g: "yeah like [right] _through_ [the] sort [of] midpoint like _through_ [the] [it's] like [a] ""u"" [and] you're _going_ [right] _through_ [the] midpoint [you] want [to] _be_ _down_ into [the] ""u"" as though [you] were _going_ _if _you_ _know_ what_ [i] mean" 
A|38| M:  
B|39| g: [yeah] below [and then] like into [the rift valley] 
A|40| M: _so_ [you know] 
B|41| g: [and] [right] _through_ 
A|42| M: ok , i'll try _that_ 
B|43| g: straight _through_ [yeah] 
A|44| M: [i] dont think _so_ 
B|45| g: _and you_ want _to go to the_ sort [of] midpoint _of the rift valley_ [you] want [to] intersect [in the] midpoint _of the rift valley_ _going_ _down_ _the way_ _do you _know_ what_ [i mean] 
A|46| M: [i] [have a] compass [in the] middle [of the] river , _so_ [i] can _see_ _where_ [i] am [going] 
B|47| g: [right] _you've got_ [in] you're _above [the_ rift valley] first [of] all [right] 
A|48| M: i'm [in [the] rift] , _so_ i'll [just] say i'm _not_ [in the] rifts . 
B|49| g: [yeah] _above [the_ rift valley] _you go_ _above [the_ rift valley] [and _then] you_ start coming _down_ as [in] into [the rift valley] _and you_ intersect like [the line] _of the rift valley_ [in the] midpoint 
A|50| M: [what] ? i'm confused . 
B|51| g: "your [rift valley is] ""u""-shaped yeah" 
A|52| M: _i don't_ [know] _where_ i'm [going] _from_ _here_ 
B|53| g: [yeah] 
A|54| M: _that's_ [the rift] river [valley] , [right] ? 
B|55| g: [yes] 
A|56| M: [its] [in [the] rift valley] 
B|57| g: [yeah] _through_ [the] midpoint below _your_ [rift valley] about four inches _down_ [do you have] _rocks_ 
A|58| M: [i] [just] hit [the] bottom [of the rift valley] 
B|59| g: _and [do_ you have _a] _stone_ creek_ 
A|60| M: [i] can try [to] _get_ [a] pic _of it_ 
B|61| g: uh-huh 
A|62| M: [yeah] [i] [got] [the] stones 
B|63| g: [yeah i've got] [that] 
A|64| M: [if [you] don't] mind i'll trade [you] [my] fenrir _for_ [a stone] mountain 
B|65| g: _you've got_ nothing [to] like [the left [of] it] 
A|66| M: [what's] [that] 
B|67| g: _well_ [i've got [a] _stone] creek_ _there_ [see] _in between_ [you] want [to _go] from [the_ rift valley] [right] _down_ _in between_ [the] _rocks_ 
A|68| M: [okay] i'll try [and] find [it] 
B|69| g: _no_ _no_ [not] sorry [i] [i] [i don't] [mean] _through_ [the] _two rocks_ [i mean] like [to the left of the] _two rocks_ about _an_ inch 
A|70| M: theres [a] rock [in between] [two rocks] ? 
B|71| g: [do you have] _white water_ 
A|72| M: i'm [going to] _take the_ time [to] look [up] [the] name [of the] lake 
B|73| g: [yeah] [that's] true _and [you_ don't] [have [a] _stone] _creek_ _above_ your_ _white water_ 
A|74| M: [i don't] [know] [if [you] have a] rock [creek [above] _the] white water_ [but] [it's] [not] [a] rock 
B|75| g: or [a] swamp [to] [its] [left] 
A|76| M: _you've got a_ lake [above your] rock 
B|77| g: [to] [its] [left] _well_ [that's] [a] [a stone] ss 
A|78| M: _you mean_ [to the right] ? 
B|79| g: oh _no_ aye [yeah] [you don't] [have] like [above the] [the] _rapids_ [to] [its] slightly [to] [its] [right] [you don't] [have [a] _stone] creek_ 
A|80| M: [no] [you] dont 
B|81| g: [no] _well_ [take] [your] [line] [right] _down_ [to] [your] _rapids_ _which_ [is] [my] [white water] [and] [just] like 
A|82| M: i'll _take it_ [back] 
B|83| g: [above] 
A|84| M: _where_ _are_ [you] [going] ? 
B|85| g: [right] [okay] [right] round [the white water] or [right] round [the] _rapids_ 
A|86| M: [just] [the way] [it] looks . 
B|87| g: _from the top_ [but] stay quite close 'cause [you don't] otherwise you're [going to] _be_ [in] [that] _stone creek_ 
A|88| M: [i don't] [know] _where_ [to go] [but] i'm _going to [the_ top] 
B|89| g: [right] [okay] come _down_ come straight _down_ [to] below [that] like [a] straight [line] _down_ [but] [take it] [to] _at_ least [two] inches below [your] outlaws' hideout [not] like [you mean] like straight _down_ [but] like 
A|90| M: [right] ok _so_ [i] am [at the] bottom [right] [corner of] [rapids] [and you] _are_ [at [the] left] 
B|91| g: [in] like length further _down_ [from] [that] [on the] page 
A|92| M: _how_ [do [you] [go] [from the] top] [right] [to the] bottom [left] ? 
B|93| g: [no] 
A|94| M: [do you have] [an] outlaws'hideout ? 
B|95| g: [you] [got] another _stone creek_

B|97| g: [and] [stone] slabs 
A|98| M: [and] _the other_ [stone] 
B|99| g: [no] _well_ [yeah] slightly [to] [its] [right] there's some [stone] slabs 
A|100| M: [no] [stone creek] ? 
B|101| g: [no] [how far] down's [the] manned fort 
A|102| M: [right] _where_ [the right of the] [well] [is] 
B|103| g: [take it] further _down_ [go] [right] under [the] manned [go] under [your] manned fort [and] [between] [your] [stone creek] 
A|104| M: [how far] [down] [is] [it] ? 
B|105| g: [no] [go] [go] [down] under [your] manned fort [and then] 
A|106| M: [you] can _see the_ [stone] walls 
B|107| g: [go] round [the] left-hand [side] 
A|108| M: [which] direction [do you] wanna [go] ? 
B|109| g: [and then] when [you get] [to the] when [you get] below [it] _go up_ towards [your] outlaws' hideout [and] sort [of] [take [the] line] sloping [up] [so] [it's] like [going] straight [up] towards [the] outlaws' hideout or [it's] [going] close [to the] hideout [it's] like you're [so] you're [going to [the] other] [side] [of the] page 
A|110| M: [you] can't [go up] [there] 
B|111| g: [yeah] 
A|112| M: [right] [side] ? 
B|113| g: [right] below [your] outlaws' hideout [a] good bit below [do you have a] noose

B|125| g: you're [right] [up] beside [that] 
A|126| M: [but] [then [you] have] [to go to the] outlaw club

A|128| M: i'm [not] gonna lie [i] [have a] goldmine 
B|129| g: [far] below [it] directly below [it] 
A|130| M: i'm pretty sure [that's] [the [top] of the] ocean 
B|131| g: aye that'll [be] [where] [my] that'll [be] [where] [my] [stone] labs that'll [be] [where] [my] [stone] slabs [are] 
A|132| M: [the] [stone] [is] [at the] bottom [of the] mountain [above the] hide out . 
B|133| g: [i] _would_ imagine 
A|134| M: [you] [would] [be] surprised [how] many people think [the] world [is] [a] flat 
B|135| g: aye [right] [okay] [so] you're saying they're [it's] [to the right] [then] this [thing] 
A|136| M: [no] [it's] [not] 
B|137| g: _right above the_ noose 
A|138| M: [how] [do you know] 
B|139| g: [okay] [from] [where] [that] [line] [is] [that] [you've] drawn [go] straight [down] 'til [you] pass [the] noose [and] you're passing [the] noose like [on] [its] right-hand [side] by [a] wee bit 
A|140| M: [you] can't [see] [it] [but] [it's] pretty much [right above [the] line] 
B|141| g: [if [you] _know] what_ [i mean] [yeah]

B|153| g: [you] want [to] avoid [that] [so] 
A|154| M: [i] [have a] pool [to the right of the] saloons [bar] 
B|155| g: [need to go] [go up] [above] [it] [and then] [down] [and] under [the] saloon [bar] [to the] finish 
A|156| M: [what] [are] [you] trying [to] [do] ?
