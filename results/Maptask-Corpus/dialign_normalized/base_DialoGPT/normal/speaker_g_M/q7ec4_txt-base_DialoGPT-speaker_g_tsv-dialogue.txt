A|0| M: _what about_ _the_ start _of the_ hill ? 
B|1| g: _go along_ _to the_ [the] left 
A|2| M: i'm _at the_ start _of the mountain_ 
B|3| g: there's no _banana tree_ _in_ this _one_ 
A|4| M: [the] [banana tree] _is there_ 
B|5| g: uh-huh well say [the] top's _north_ _and_ 
A|6| M: _the top_ _is_ [north] 
B|7| g: _go_ west 
A|8| M: _i_ can't 
B|9| g: until you've _just_ got past [the] edge [of the] crest falls 
A|10| M: [go] [north] 
B|11| g: "and _then_ _come_ _down_ until _you_ reach _a_ an angle maybe _just_ past _south_ towards west slightly past until _you_ reach [the] bottom [of] crest falls _and a_ level with [the] ""c"" _and_ maybe [about] an inch _to_ west [of the] ""c""" 
A|12| M: _that's_ [a] lot [of] _up_ _and down_ 
B|13| g: _right and then go_ due west until _about two_ centimetres _from the_ edge [of the] paper 
A|14| M: [then go] east [and] _up the_ slope 
B|15| g: _now_ _do _you_ _have_ a_ footbridge 
A|16| M: _i_ [have a] bridge 
B|17| g: _right_ [go] _up north_ _now_ until _you're_ _just_ due [north] until _you're_ _just_ below [the] [the] level [of the] footbridge 
A|18| M: _right i_ am _going_ [up north] , _i_ am [just] _going_ _up the_ [tree]

A|22| M: yes sir 
B|23| g: well [just] [at the] [the] footbridge next _to_ _when_ _you_ _come_ off there's [a] poisoned stream _so_ _when_ _you_ _come_ off [the] footbridge _you have to go_ due _south_ maybe [about] an inch _and a_ half 
A|24| M: _i_ think _it's_ [just] [the] foot bridge 
B|25| g: uh-huh _and then_ och take [a] wee bit more _to be_ safe [just] [a] wee touch more 
A|26| M: _it's_ fine . _i_ [just] _don't_ like [to be] caught [in] [the] middle _of a_ river [when] i'm _on the_ foot bridge 
B|27| g: _and then_ _do _you_ have_ an _old temple_ 
A|28| M: _and just_ like _that_ , [you're] [in] 
B|29| g: [right] _go along_ _eastward_ _for_ _about two inches_ 
A|30| M: _and do you_ want [to go] [to the] [eastward] 
B|31| g: _and _then_ curve_ [up] until [you're] [at the] bottom [of _the] old temple_ 
A|32| M: [right] [then [go] along] westward [for] [a] few [inches] 
B|33| g: mmhmm _now_ [go] [up] _about two_ _and a_ half [inches] [do _you] have_ anything above _the old temple_ [in] [that] area [up] [there] 
A|34| M: yes , yes _i_ [do] 
B|35| g: [right] [what about] [do _you] have_ an _abandoned_ _truck_ 
A|36| M: _i_ [have a] car . 
B|37| g: uh-huh 
A|38| M: okay _where_ _are_ [you] ? 
B|39| g: [is there] anything between _the old temple_ [and] _the truck_ 
A|40| M: [the old temple] [is] _the abandoned_ [one] . 
B|41| g: [right i] [don't] [have] [that] 
A|42| M: [i] think _it's_ [a] slate _mountain_ , but i'm not 100 
B|43| g: [go] _two_ _and a_ half [inches] [up] over [the] [temple] [the] [up the] _side_ [of] _it_ 
A|44| M: [what] [is] [the] stone ? 
B|45| g: _and then_ _and then_ say an angle [of] northwest forty-five degrees 
A|46| M: [and] start _and stop_ [and] start [and] start [again] 
B|47| g: [go] [up] [for] _about two inches_ [that] would probably take [you] past [the top] [of the] 
A|48| M: [go] [one] [and a] quarter [and] you'll [have] [it] 
B|49| g: something uh-huh 
A|50| M: huh [what] ? 
B|51| g: _and _then_ _back_ down_ [at _the] same_ angle [to] well [the] opposite angle anyway _to get_ [you] [down] [to] your [abandoned] _truck_ [just] below [it] 
A|52| M: [so] [then [the] truck] goes _down the_ hill [to [the] truck] , [then _back] up_ 
B|53| g: _and then go_ straight across [the] bottom [of [the] abandoned] [truck] 
A|54| M: [right and then go] backwards [to the] [back] [of [the] truck] 
B|55| g: "until [you're] [just] below [the] ""a""" 
A|56| M: [then] _it's_ [a] [truck] 
B|57| g: _now_ [have] [you] got baboons 
A|58| M: i'm [a] baby . 
B|59| g: [right] _now come_ due _south_ 
A|60| M: [now come] [south] 
B|61| g: [about] an inch [and a] half [to] an inch [and] three quarters 
A|62| M: [about] [tree] fiddy 
B|63| g: [and then] due west [for] _about two inches_ _uh_ [then] 
A|64| M: okay , [just] tell me [when] [you're] ready 
B|65| g: [do _you] [have_ a] white [mountain] further [up] 
A|66| M: [about two inches] 
B|67| g: "right [now] well _the best_ _thing_ [to] [do] first [of] all would [be] [come] [back _up] to_ [where] [you] were [at the] ""a"" [and] [the] [come] _up to_ make [that] [a] ""u"" shape" 
A|68| M: huh , [uh] 
B|69| g: [and then] draw [a] line straight between this point [and] maybe [about] half [a] centimetre [to the] west [of the] bottom [of the] white [mountain] 
A|70| M: [you're] welcome 
B|71| g: [right] [now] mm [go] [up the] _side_ [of the mountain] until [you're] maybe follow [the] _side_ [for] [up] until [about] half an inch below [the] summit 
A|72| M: [right] [then] 
B|73| g: [and then] change [to] [going] due _north for_ [about] three [inches] 
A|74| M: move [north] 
B|75| g: ah there's no lemon grove [in] this [one] 
A|76| M: [and] [you have to go] [north for] [a] mile [to the] [north] 
B|77| g: [right] [is there] _a pyramid_ 
A|78| M: [right and] east _are_ [the same] 
B|79| g: yeah [now] this'll [be] [you] [just] [about] [a] third [of the] _way_ [up _the] pyramid_ 
A|80| M: [and] [now] [you're] _on [the_ other side] 
B|81| g: [and then] straight across until [about] [a] centimetre [to the] west [of _the] pyramid_ 
A|82| M: [and] [back down] 
B|83| g: no straight across until 
A|84| M: [you] should [have] walked [up [to] _the] pyramid and_ said [you're] sorry 
B|85| g: [on [the] same] level 
A|86| M: [and then] 
B|87| g: [and then] mm [go] [up] over [the top] [of [the] pyramid and] [in] [a] [a] cone sort [of a] [a] triangle shape [and [down] [the] other side] until [you're] [at the] base [of [the] pyramid] 
A|88| M: theres [a pyramid] [in] [the] center [of the] map 
B|89| g: [right] [do [you] [have] a] _cobbled_ street 
A|90| M: _it's_ pretty good but _the cobbled_ streets _are_ not very good 
B|91| g: [right] below [the pyramid] there's [a] [cobbled] street [and] 
A|92| M: [i] know [what] [you] mean . 
B|93| g: ehm [it's] below [the] western [side] [of [the] pyramid] 
A|94| M: _that's_ _where [the_ pyramid] [is] 
B|95| g: "now _from_ [where] [you] [are] [just] [now] draw [a] _curved_ line 'til [you're] below [the] ""d"" [of] pyramid" 
A|96| M: [the pyramid] [is] not [the] only [thing] [that] [is] [curved] 
B|97| g: [and then] straight across until [you're] [just] below [the] point [of [the] pyramid] [at the] western tip 
A|98| M: [you] could [just] straighten [the pyramid] . 
B|99| g: [right] [go] [at] an angle slightly more slightly [to the] west [of] [south] 
A|100| M: [right] , [so] [what] [is] [the best] [way] [to get] [the pyramid] [to [the] top] ? 
B|101| g: [to] avoid [the cobbled] street [there] [and do [you] [have] a] _remote_ village 
A|102| M: i'll [be] [on] my [way] 
B|103| g: [and _just] to_ [where the] [the] thick lines [at _the] remote_ village drawing [are] 
A|104| M: [just [to] the] far east 
B|105| g: [just] [about] [a] centimetre [to the] west [of the] thick line [and stop] [there] 
A|106| M: how far away [is] [it] [from the] road ? 
B|107| g: "now _curve_ round draw [a] _curve_ until [you're] below [the] ""r"" [of] remote" 
A|108| M: _that's_ not [what] [i] meant . i'm asking if [you're] saying _that's_ [what] [you] mean by [a] circle , [and] not [a] circle . 
B|109| g: "and [then] straight across until [you're] below [the] ""e""" 
A|110| M: [then curve] 
B|111| g: "the ""e"" [in] village sorry" 
A|112| M: [you] should [have] [the remote] , you'll [get] [the remote] 
B|113| g: [and then go] straight across another inch [and] [that's] [the] finish 
A|114| M: [and] [you] can [do] [it] [on] [a] wooden board [and] [it's] [a] very quick [and] easy
