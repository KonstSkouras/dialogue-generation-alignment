A|0| M: _okay_ , i'll _just_ _go_ _in_ _there and_ check 
B|1| g: _right_ _take_ _that_ same _line_ still _down_ vertically _to the_ left _of the_ _ravine_ 
A|2| M: _no i_ mean _like a_ little _bit_ [down] 
B|3| g: well [just] _draw round_ _it_ 
A|4| M: _i_ think _you_ can't _go_ around [the] ravines _on_ [the] ravins 
B|5| g: uh-huh _is _the_ cottage_ _in the_ _way_ [there] [no] 
A|6| M: _it's_ _a_ [ravine] . 
B|7| g: well _that's_ [okay] _right now_ _take_ _that_ _take_ _the line _is_ _the_ cottage_ directly beside [the] [ravine] 
A|8| M: _i_ dont _know_ how [to] [take] _a_ picture [of] _a_ [ravine] , [it] was [the] ravines fault 
B|9| g: _is_ [there] [a] space _between_ them _yeah_ 
A|10| M: _oh_ _so you're_ [in the] ravines [right now] ? 
B|11| g: [right] [take] _the line_ [and] _go to_ _your_ [right] underneath _the cottage_ _can_ [you] _do that_ 
A|12| M: i'm [in the] ravines , [just] walk around [and] you'll find me 
B|13| g: _yeah_ _but i want _you_ _to_ draw_ _up_ _through_ _between_ _the cottage_ _and the_ [ravine] 
A|14| M: [i] think _you're_ [the] _one_ [that] needs [to _draw] that_ 
B|15| g: [no] _up_ _through_ [go] _go down_ vertically until [you're] [and] [draw] underneath _the cottage_ [and] _then_ _come_ _up_ 
A|16| M: [i] think _it's_ more [to] [do] _with the_ angle [of the] picture 
B|17| g: _between_ _the cottage_ _and the_ [ravine] 
A|18| M: _where_ _do you_ live ? 
B|19| g: [you] weren't _meant to_ 
A|20| M: [i] was told [it] was supposed _to be_ [a] pond 
B|21| g: [okay] [right] [you] _went_ [down] _past _burnt_ forest_ 
A|22| M: [i] _did_ 
B|23| g: well [you] weren't _meant to_ 
A|24| M: [i] was _not_ 
B|25| g: [okay] [right] [you're] _meant _to_ come_ [down] from [the] start 
A|26| M: [i] was [meant [to] [draw] round] , [but i] [went] [up] 
B|27| g: vertically _right past _burnt_ forest_ 
A|28| M: turns around [and] stands [up] [you] were supposed [to come] 
B|29| g: keep _drawing_ vertically 
A|30| M: vertical _towards_ [burnt forest] [and] back 
B|31| g: _past_ _the cottage_ 
A|32| M: [right past burnt] mountain 
B|33| g: _then_ [go] [right] underneath _the cottage_ 
A|34| M: [then] turn [right] 
B|35| g: [go] [up] _through_ _between_ _the cottage_ _and the_ [ravine] 'til [you] _get to_ stop [just] above [the] [ravine] 
A|36| M: [go down] [through] [the] ravines 
B|37| g: [and] [do you] _have a_ remote village 
A|38| M: _go to [the_ cottage] [then] 
B|39| g: well [on] _my_ _map_ _to the right_ [of] [burnt] [cottage] there's [a] remote village [okay] 
A|40| M: [i] can't find any . 
B|41| g: uh-huh [and] _that's_ [just] situated above [the] [ravine] 
A|42| M: yes , _where_ [is] [it] ? 
B|43| g: [okay] [so] _i want _you_ _to_ imagine_ _i want _you_ _to_ imagine_ [that] [the] remote village [is] [there] [just] _to the right_ [of the] [burnt forest] [right] [so] [it's] kind [of] [like] [in] [a] triangle 
A|44| M: [i want _you] _not_ [to_ imagine] 
B|45| g: [so] _draw your_ _line_ _to the right_ horizontally above [the] [ravine] [okay] [then] [do you] _have a_ pine [forest] 
A|46| M: _i don't_ [have _a] tree_ [on] [the] [map] 
B|47| g: [a] pine grove uh-huh 
A|48| M: [a] [forest] 
B|49| g: [i want _you] [to_ _draw] _the_ line_ keep _going to_ _your_ [right] [okay] [so you're] sort [of] [like] _drawing_ [towards] [the] top [of the] pine grove [then] stop [and] [go] from left [to] [right] [in] [a] diagonal underneath [the] pine grove 
A|50| M: [okay] [but i want you] [draw your] lines 
B|51| g: from from [the] top [of the] [ravine] [to] underneath [the] pine grove 
A|52| M: what's [the] story here ? 
B|53| g: uh-huh [okay] [and] [then] [do you] [have] _anything_ underneath pine grove 
A|54| M: [i want] [to] say [i] _did_ [but _i] don't_ . [i want] [to] _see_ if anyone [can] confirm . 
B|55| g: mm [is] [that] [just] [right] beneath [it] 
A|56| M: [the] air vent [is the] air vent 
B|57| g: [do you] [have] concealed _hideout_ 
A|58| M: [i] think [i] [have a] small [hideout] for [you to] hang [in the] cove 
B|59| g: [okay] [right] [i] _that's_ _fine_ [right] [i want [you] _to] go_ [draw] [to] [your] [to] [your] [right] _under_ [the] pine grove avoiding _the avalanche_ 
A|60| M: [i] was [going to] [do that] , [but i] didn't [want] _to get_ caught [in [the] avalanche] [and] [have] _to go to_ [my] [to] [my] [right] 
B|61| g: uh-huh 
A|62| M: [that's] _not_ _where i want_ [to go] 
B|63| g: [can] [you] [go] _between_ [the] pine grove _and [the_ avalanche] 
A|64| M: _okay i_ [can] [do that] 
B|65| g: [to get] [past] [it] _yeah_ well [draw that] _way_ 
A|66| M: huhuh [i] wanna [draw] [it] 
B|67| g: [not] [not] completely [down] [just] [get] [past] [the avalanche] [right] 
A|68| M: [get [to] the] hidden [hideout] [and] you'll _be_ [fine] 
B|69| g: [and] [then] ehm eventually [i want [you] [to] go] [round] concealed [hideout] 
A|70| M: yes [i] [can] 
B|71| g: [okay] 
A|72| M: im [not] sure

A|74| M: [i] dont _see_ [anything] 
B|75| g: uh-huh [and] [i want [you] [to] draw] underneath concealed [hideout] stop [just] underneath concealed [bit] [there] [okay] are [you] [there]

A|80| M: [i] [have] [one] 
B|81| g: [draw] [to] [just] before _the boat_ house writing starts [there] [right] [okay] [that's] [where [i want] [you] [to] be] 
A|82| M: i'm [going to] _make_ [you] [a] camper 
B|83| g: uh-huh

B|93| g: uh-huh 
A|94| M: [the] other side 
B|95| g: [have] [you] drawn [down] [to] [there] 
A|96| M: yea [i] [got] [it] 
B|97| g: _good_ [right] [imagine] you've [got] [a] [boat] house [to the] left [of the] concealed [hideout] [right] _do you see_ [where] [in] [can] _you see_ crane _bay_ 
A|98| M: [yeah i] _know_ 
B|99| g: _do you see_ [where] there's _where the_ coastline comes [round] [it's] um there's [a] sort [of] [like] jutting out [bit] there's [like a] point 
A|100| M: what [do you] mean ? 
B|101| g: [just] underneath concealed [hideout] 
A|102| M: [i] [thought you] said [you] were [in] canada ? 
B|103| g: or [just] _to the right_ [of] [it] [okay [i] want [you] to] _you see_ [where] [it] comes [down] [like] [that] 
A|104| M: how [do you see] [it] ? 
B|105| g: well [i want [you] to] follow follow _the line of the_ [the] coast [there] [so] [draw] from concealed [hideout] vertically downwards 'til [you] [come] [to] [that] jutting out [bit] [of the] coastline [then] until until [on] [that] incline _draw you_ [know] follow _the line of the_ coast [but] [don't] [don't] [go] [on] [to] crane _bay_ until [you] [come] [to the] [the] next [bit] [that] comes [up] [okay] stop [there] 
A|106| M: i'm pretty sure [it's] [just] [under] concealment . 
B|107| g: [right] [do you] [have] ehm _coconut palm_ [to] [your] left 
A|108| M: [you] need [to draw] [a] [line] [between] 
B|109| g: [no] [do you] [have] pebbled shore 
A|110| M: [i don't] think [so] 
B|111| g: well [i want [you] [to] draw] uh i've [got] pebbled shore [and] above [that] i've [got] _coconut palm_ 
A|112| M: [i] am [not] sure if [i] am , [but i] _would_ [like] [to [draw] you] [a] picture [of] [a] [coconut palm] . 
B|113| g: [right] [so] [imagine] you've [got] [a tree] [there and] [i want [you] [to] draw] [between] [where] [that] [tree] [would] [be] _where the_ pebbled shore [is] [so] [just] keep [drawing] [go] [make] [your] [line] [go down] [a] [bit] [right] [and] [just] [to come] [to] above pebbled shore [and] [just] stop [the] end [there and] [then] ehm [i don't] suppose you've [got] finished marked [on] [your] [map] [no] [right] [have] [you] [got] [anything] _below_ pebbled shore 
A|114| M: gasp 
B|115| g: well 
A|116| M: [not] [a] problem [i] [just] [have] [to draw] [a tree] 
B|117| g: [right] [see] [see] _where the_ flagship [is] 
A|118| M: [the line of the] [tree] [and [the] line of] [a] ship . 
B|119| g: [right] [and] [see] _where the_ pebbled shore [is] 
A|120| M: [right] look [where the] [bay] [is] 
B|121| g: [imagine] [a] [a] triangle [with] ehm an equilateral triangle [with the] pebbled shore flagship [and] _finish_ [right] [can] [you] 
A|122| M: yes [you] [can] 
B|123| g: sort [of] [see] [where] [that] [is] [right] [imagine] [the] _finish_ [is] [there] [draw] roughly [down] [to] [there] 
A|124| M: im sure [it] will [be] [a] great [finish] [but i] [just] [want] [to] [know] if [i] [can] [finish] [the] final [one] 
B|125| g: [it] [would] [be] [just] [just] near mmhmm [but] [you] [just] [right] near [the] end [of the] page 
A|126| M: [i want] [to] [see] [the] [map] 
B|127| g: [yeah] uh-huh 
A|128| M: [so] , [where] [is] [it] ? 
B|129| g: [no] [no] [not _to] the right_ 
A|130| M: _i don't know_ how [to] [do that] [but] i'm [not] sure how [to] [make] [it] work 
B|131| g: [no] 
A|132| M: [it's] [a] bug 
B|133| g: [the] left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore 
A|134| M: what side [of the] [map] ? 
B|135| g: well [just] [draw] [in] [a] diagonal [to] [your] left 
A|136| M: [i] am [not] [good] [at] [drawing] . 
B|137| g: mmhmm [right] quite _far_ [down] 
A|138| M: [you're] [right] , [i] should [draw [the] right] [way] [down] 
B|139| g: [and] [then] 
A|140| M: [then] [then] 
B|141| g: well [i want [you] _to] avoid_ [that] 
A|142| M: [i want] [to avoid] [the] downvotes 
B|143| g: [and] [go] uh-huh [no] well [i don't know] where's [your] where's [your] washed stones 
A|144| M: [oh] , [you're] [right] . 
B|145| g: well [that's] [okay] [just] [draw round] [it] [and] [past] [it] 
A|146| M: its [right] [below] [the] beach 
B|147| g: [yeah] 
A|148| M: [but] [the line _is] just_ too [far] [to the right] 
B|149| g: [and] [then] [the] [finish] [is just] ehm [on] [a] horizontal [with the] flagship near [to the] coast about [a] centimetre away from [the] coast 
A|150| M: [you] [can] [just] [go to the] bottom [and] [you] [can] [do] [the] final [finish] 
B|151| g: mmhmm 
A|152| M: [you] should [have] waited for [the] last minute , [you] could [have] had [a] chance [to get] [the] achievement 
B|153| g: [okay] 
A|154| M: i'll [be] [there] 
B|155| g: [is] [that] [just] beside [the] flagship [yeah] 
A|156| M: [there] [is] [one] [in the] bottom [right] corner 
B|157| g: [okay] 
A|158| M: [just] wait till [i] [get] back
