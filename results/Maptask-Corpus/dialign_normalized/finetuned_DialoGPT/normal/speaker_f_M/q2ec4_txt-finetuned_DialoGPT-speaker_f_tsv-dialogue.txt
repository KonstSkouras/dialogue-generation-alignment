B|12| f: [mmhmm] 
A|13| M: _just_ keep _going_ [down] until you're _about_ _an inch_ away [from _the] left-hand_ _edge of [the_ rift]

A|15| M: [yeah] 
B|16| f: [ehm] _that's_ _going to_ _take_ _me_ pretty near _to the_ cactus thing _so_ _i'm_ trying _to_ avoid _that_ 
A|17| M: [so] you're avoiding [the] cactuses 
B|18| f: hang _on_ hang _on_ [right] [an inch] _to the right of the_ diamond _mine_ 
A|19| M: _right right_ 
B|20| f: [yeah] _and then_ _straight_ _down to_ [an inch] _below it_ 
A|21| M: _right right_ 
B|22| f: [yeah] 
A|23| M: [right] _now_ _you want_ _to go_ [ehm] [down] [towards _the] bottom_ _of the page_

B|34| f: [yeah] 
A|35| M: _right okay so_ _if you_ _go_ [up] _the left-hand _side_ [of_ [the] rift] midway [up] [the page] [and] stop [at the] end [of] [it] 
B|36| f: [right] [go] through [the] centre i'll _just take_ [it] _up and_ [go] through [the] centre [yeah] 
A|37| M: [yeah] [okay] 
B|38| f: [right okay] erm [i'm] [not] _that so_ [i] _should be below_ _there_ when [i'm] taking [the] _line_ [up]

A|43| M: [right] 
B|44| f: alright _there_ we [go] 
A|45| M: " !!! ' !!! ' !! "" !! 8 !! 4 !! 6 !! 7 !! "

B|128| f: [yeah] 
A|129| M: [you want] [to go] [you want] [to] keep _the gold mine_ [on] _your_ [left-hand side] 
B|130| f: "not directly _below it_ [just] _just [below_ the] ""u"" [if you] [take] [it] [down] [from the] [hideout] [er] [that] [that's] [just] [that's] [just] [at [the] left-hand] side"

A|133| M: [i've got rapids] 
B|134| f: 'cause [my] [stone slabs] [are] [like] maybe [what] two [and] [a] half inches [below] [and to the left] 
A|135| M: [yeah] [so] [if you] [just take] [a] [line] [right] [round [the] bottom] [of the] abandoned cottage 
B|136| f: [the gold mine] [is] 
A|137| M: [right okay] 
B|138| f: [mm] aye directly [above [the] noose] [that's] [a] better description 
A|139| M: " !!! ' !!,!!! ' !! 226 !! "" !! bolshevik !! " 
B|140| f: [on] its [right-hand] [side]

A|145| M: [right] 
B|146| f: [i've got] [the] saloon bar [and] [i've got] [the stone creek] directly across [to the left of [the] noose] [er] [but] [i've got] nothing else in [that] area [at] [all] 
A|147| M: [so] [have you [got] anything] [to the right of the] saloons 
B|148| f: [you know] [like] [below that] [i] [should] say [i mean] in [the] in [the] middle [and to] [above] [them [and] [the] [stone] slabs]

B|150| f: [mmhmm] 
A|151| M: [right] 
B|152| f: [right so] [i've] [to] avoid [that] 
A|153| M: [and then] [i go] along [to the left] 
B|154| f: [so] [go] _above it_ 
A|155| M: [above it]
