A|48| M: _uh-huh_ 
B|49| g: [yeah] _above the_ rift valley _you go_ _above the_ rift valley _and then you_ _start_ coming _down_ [as] _in_ into [the] rift valley [and] [you] intersect _like_ [the] line _of the_ rift valley _in the_ midpoint 
A|50| M: [in the] west 
B|51| g: "your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah" 
A|52| M: [yeah okay] 
B|53| g: [yeah] 
A|54| M: _right okay_ 
B|55| g: yes 
A|56| M: [right]

B|65| g: [you've got] nothing [to] _like_ _the left _of_ it_ 
A|66| M: _the left of the_ outlaws'hideout _'cause_ [it's] _directly_ [above the] [start] 
B|67| g: _well [i've_ got a] _stone_ creek [there] see [in] between _you want to go_ _from_ [the] rift valley [right] [down] [in] between _the rocks_ 
A|68| M: [uh-huh] 
B|69| g: [no] [no] _not_ sorry i i i don't mean through [the] [two] _rocks_ i mean _like_ _to the left of the_ [two] _rocks_ _about an inch_

A|80| M: [no] 
B|81| g: [no] [well] take [your] line [right] [down] [to] [your] rapids which is [my] _white water_ [and] _just like_ 
A|82| M: _so_ [i've] [to [go] up] [and] _round _the_ [top_ of _the] white water_ 
B|83| g: [above]

A|88| M: [right] 
B|89| g: [right okay] [come] [down] [come] [straight down] [to] [below] _that_ _like a_ [straight] line [down] _but_ take _it_ [to] _at_ least [two inches] [below] [your] outlaws' _hideout_ [not] _like_ [you] mean _like_ [straight down] _but_ _like_ 
A|90| M: [right] 
B|91| g: [in] _like_ length further [down] _from that_ _on [the_ page] 
A|92| M: [right] 
B|93| g: [no] 
A|94| M: [right] [well] [you're going to _go] down_ [slightly [to] the [right] and] form [a] curve around [the] outside [of _the] manned fort_

A|96| M: [uh-huh] 
B|97| g: [and] _stone_ slabs 
A|98| M: [yeah] 
B|99| g: [no] [well] [yeah] [slightly to] its [right] there's some _stone_ slabs 
A|100| M: [right] [well go] [along [to the] left of the] [stone] slants [and then] [sort of] [up [to] the sort of] bottom _left-hand _side_ of [the_ white] [of the] rapid 
B|101| g: [no] how far down's [the manned fort] 
A|102| M: _ehm_ [it's] [about halfway] [down [the] page] 
B|103| g: take _it_ further [down] [go] [right] _under_ [the manned] [go] _under_ [your] [manned fort] [and] between [your] [stone] creek 
A|104| M: [under] [manned fort] _mmhmm_ 
B|105| g: [no] [go] [go down] [under] [your] [manned fort] [and then] 
A|106| M: [under] [manned fort] [do you have] [stone] slaps 
B|107| g: [go] [round the left-hand side] 
A|108| M: [right] 
B|109| g: [and then] when [you] get [to the] when [you] get [below] _it_ [go up] towards [your] outlaws' _hideout_ [and] [sort of] take [the] line sloping [up] _so it's_ _like_ [going] _straight up_ towards [the] outlaws' _hideout_ or [it's] [going] close [to the] _hideout_ [it's] _like_ [you're] _so [you're_ going [to] the] other [side of the page] 
A|110| M: [right] [right okay] 
B|111| g: [yeah] 
A|112| M: [right] 
B|113| g: [right] [below] [your] outlaws' _hideout_ [a] good bit [below] [do you have] [a] _noose_ 
A|114| M: [yeah] [it's] [about] [it's] [below] _it's [to the right_ of] [my] [manned fort] _about two inches_ 
B|115| g: [no] 
A|116| M: [right] [well] [you want to [go] down] [slightly] [from _that] [so_ you're] [sort of] level _with the_ _gold mine_ [at the] bottom 
B|117| g: [no i've got] nothing 
A|118| M: [right] [well] [you] _need to [go_ up] [and] [round the] _gold mine_ [so] [that] [you're] [on the] _right-hand [side_ [of] it] 
B|119| g: [do you have] [a] swan pond 
A|120| M: [no] 
B|121| g: [no] [do you have] [a] saloon bar 
A|122| M: [no] 
B|123| g: head for [that] [and] we'll be [okay] [no] [ehm] see [the] outlaws' _hideout_ 
A|124| M: [yeah] 
B|125| g: [you're] [right] [up] beside [that] 
A|126| M: [right] 
B|127| g: [you've _got] a gold mine_ _a gold mine_ [you _got] a gold mine_ [below] [that] 
A|128| M: [i've got] [the] outlaw's [hideout] [yeah] 
B|129| g: far [below] [it] _directly below_ [it] 
A|130| M: [yeah] [directly [below] the] [start] 
B|131| g: aye that'll be where [my] that'll be where [my] [stone] labs that'll be where [my] [stone] slabs are 
A|132| M: [right] 
B|133| g: i would imagine 
A|134| M: [right okay right] 
B|135| g: aye [right okay] [so you're] saying they're [it's to the right] [then] this thing 
A|136| M: [yeah] 
B|137| g: [right] [above the] _noose_ 
A|138| M: [above the] [no] [noose] [i've [got a] gold mine] [as well] 
B|139| g: [okay] [from] where [that] line is [that] [you've] drawn _go [straight_ down] 'til [you] pass [the] [noose] [and] [you're] passing [the] [noose] _like_ [on] its [right-hand side] by [a] wee bit 
A|140| M: okaye 
B|141| g: if [you] know what i mean [yeah] 
A|142| M: [on [the] left-hand] left-huh 
B|143| g: [mmhmm] 
A|144| M: [and then [you] [go] [straight] up] [about an inch] [and then] [you're going to [go] up] [again] [but] [you're] [not] [going] over [the] [no] [noose] yet [you're] still [on the] right-left-hand slope 
B|145| g: [yeah] [then you] don't [have] [anything] else [down] _like_ 
A|146| M: [i've got a] ravine 
B|147| g: [uh-huh] [right] 
A|148| M: [so] [you've got] 
B|149| g: [okay right] [you] know how [the] _like_ [on] line [with the] saloon bar 
A|150| M: uh [yeah] 
B|151| g: [about two inches] [along] [i've got a] swans pond 
A|152| M: [no] 
B|153| g: [you want to] avoid [that so] 
A|154| M: [so] i'm [going [right] round the] saloons 
B|155| g: [need to go] [go up] [above] [it] [and then] [down] [and] [under] [the] saloon bar [to the] finish 
A|156| M: [so it's] [just [like] a] [sort of] 
B|157| g: is [that] [you] 
A|158| M: [no] 
B|159| g: yee-ha [okay] 
A|160| M: [right] [so] we're [at the] bottom
