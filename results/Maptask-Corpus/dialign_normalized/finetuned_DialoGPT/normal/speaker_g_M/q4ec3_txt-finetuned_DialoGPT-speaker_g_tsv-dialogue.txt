A|48| M: _right okay_ 
B|49| g: _i want you_ [to] draw [the] line keep _going to_ your [right okay] [so] you're sort [of] like drawing towards [the] top [of the pine grove] _then_ stop _and go_ from [left] [to] [right] in [a] diagonal _underneath [the_ pine grove] 
A|50| M: [right okay] 
B|51| g: from from [the] top [of the] ravine [to] _underneath [the_ pine grove]

A|60| M: [right okay] 
B|61| g: [uh-huh] 
A|62| M: [and [go] up] _about_ two inches 
B|63| g: _can_ [you go] between [the pine grove] [and] [the] avalanche 
A|64| M: [i] [can] indeed 
B|65| g: [to] get _past it_ [yeah] [well] draw [that] _way_ 
A|66| M: [to go] [past it] 
B|67| g: _not_ _not_ completely [down] _just_ get [past] [the] avalanche [right] 
A|68| M: [right] 
B|69| g: _and then_ ehm eventually _i want you_ [to go] [round] _concealed_ hideout 
A|70| M: _mmhmm_ 
B|71| g: [okay] 
A|72| M: [i want you] [then] [to go] straight [up] [the way] [to _the] concealed_ hide _out_

B|97| g: good [right] imagine _you've got a_ boat house [to [the] left] [of [the] concealed] hideout [right] _do you_ see where in [can] [you] see _crane bay_ 
A|98| M: [yeah] 
B|99| g: _do you_ see where there's where [the] coastline comes [round] it's um there's [a] sort [of] like jutting [out] bit there's like [a] point 
A|100| M: [yeah] 
B|101| g: _just underneath_ [concealed] hideout 
A|102| M: [yeah] [i've got] [that] 
B|103| g: or _just_ _to the right_ [of it] [okay] [i want you] [to] [you] see where [it] comes [down] like [that] 
A|104| M: [to the right] 
B|105| g: [well] [i want you] [to] follow follow [the] line [of the] [the] coast _there_ [so] draw from [concealed] hideout vertically downwards 'til [you] come [to] [that] jutting [out] bit [of the] coastline [then] until until on [that] incline draw [you] know follow [the] line [of the] coast but [don't] [don't] [go] on [to] _crane bay_ until [you] come [to the] [the] next bit [that] comes [up] [okay] stop _there_ 
A|106| M: [mm] 
B|107| g: [right] _do you have_ ehm coconut palm [to] your [left]

B|113| g: [right so] imagine _you've got a_ _tree_ [there] [and] [i want you] [to] draw between where [that] _tree_ would [be] where [the] pebbled shore [is] [so] _just_ keep drawing [go] make your line [go down] [a] bit _right and_ _just_ [to] come [to] above pebbled shore [and] _just_ stop [the] end [there] _and then_ ehm [i don't] suppose _you've got_ _finished_ marked on your map [no] [right] _have you got_ anything [below] pebbled shore 
A|114| M: [i've got] [i've] curved [round] [crane bay] 
B|115| g: [well] 
A|116| M: [have you got] pea [tree] 
B|117| g: [right] see see where [the] flagship [is] 
A|118| M: [uh-huh] 
B|119| g: _right and_ see where [the] pebbled shore [is] 
A|120| M: [uh-huh] 
B|121| g: imagine _a a_ triangle with ehm _an_ equilateral triangle with [the] pebbled shore flagship [and] _finish_ [right] [can] [you] 
A|122| M: [can] [i] [go down] [there] 
B|123| g: sort [of] see where [that] [is] [right] imagine _the finish_ [is] [there] draw roughly [down] [to] [there] 
A|124| M: [right okay] 
B|125| g: [it] would [be] _just_ _just_ near [mmhmm] but [you] _just_ [right] near [the] end [of the] page 
A|126| M: [yeah] 
B|127| g: [yeah] [uh-huh] 
A|128| M: [right] 
B|129| g: [no] [no] _not_ [to the right] 
A|130| M: [oh] [right [okay] right] 
B|131| g: [no] 
A|132| M: [right okay] [go down] _about_ [an] inch [and then] curve [round] [the] side [of the] missionary camp 
B|133| g: [the left] _you've_ _you've_ [drawn] above pebbled shore 
A|134| M: [uh-huh] 
B|135| g: [well] _just_ draw in [a] diagonal [to] your [left] 
A|136| M: [right okay] 
B|137| g: [mmhmm] [right] quite far [down] 
A|138| M: [right okay] 
B|139| g: [and then] 
A|140| M: " !!! >] !! ' !!! ' !! "" !!,!! 8 !! 4 !! 6 !! 7 !! " 
B|141| g: [well] [i want you] [to] avoid [that] 
A|142| M: [so] i'm [going] [up] [and then] across 
B|143| g: [and go] [uh-huh] [no] [well] [i don't] know where's your where's your _washed_ stones 
A|144| M: [i've] [not] [got] [washed] 
B|145| g: [well] _that's_ [okay] _just_ draw [round] [it] [and] [past it] 
A|146| M: [right] 
B|147| g: [yeah] 
A|148| M: " !!!!,!! ' !!! ' !! "" !! rem !! [okay] !! [there] !! " 
B|149| g: [and then] _the finish_ [is] _just_ ehm on [a] horizontal with [the] flagship near [to the] coast [about] [a] centimetre [away] from [the] coast 
A|150| M: [okay] 
B|151| g: [mmhmm] 
A|152| M: [right so] [you've got [a] [a] a] wee cross [then] [that] [that's] [it] [finished] 
B|153| g: [okay] 
A|154| M: [right [and] then] we're [going [to] go] straight along [to [the] finish] 
B|155| g: [is] [that] _just_ beside [the] flagship [yeah] 
A|156| M: [yeah] 
B|157| g: [okay] 
A|158| M: [and [then do you have] a] great viewpoint [just [underneath] the] east lake
