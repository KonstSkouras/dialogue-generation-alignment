g:	right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
M:	okay where are you?
g:	no well
M:	the cave is about 2 blocks away
g:	yes
M:	can you please tell me how to curve the curve?
g:	right
M:	right now
g:	you have a fast flowing creek
M:	oh i'm on the right side
g:	right and then to your right again
M:	the only way to do it
g:	no the height above them but just below the lake but above the antelope
M:	then go east and up the slope
g:	past the cottage
M:	turn around
g:	right so we'll go straight down then straight down and don't hit the bay but but follow that curve in the bay so you're going to go straight down south
M:	i have a feeling you're going to have a hard time finding a parking spot
g:	right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout
M:	yeah back down
g:	no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like
M:	ok alright alright
g:	go north and go north due north and proceed east over the footbridge just over it stop at the end of the footbridge
M:	i cant see it, im on the right side
g:	no ehm it's about in line with the fallen pillars
M:	i'm on the way to the east then
g:	yeah
M:	right i don't care
g:	yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine
M:	bottom left
g:	right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
M:	do you go to the bottom?
g:	turn right now go diagonally down towards the not a steep diagonal towards the middle
M:	i'll be there
g:	you're coming you're coming back you're coming down the map so you're turning left that's into that's into the map
M:	i dont think so
g:	between the cottage and the ravine
M:	turn around
g:	above
M:	oh yeah
g:	understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
M:	the other side
g:	yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water
M:	no i dont
g:	right you uh-huh below the diamond mine
M:	so i'm going to the wrong hideout right?
g:	go right go straight underneath the trout farm
M:	what? i'm confused.
g:	um do you have anything between this cattle stockade and the bandit territory
M:	how do you get to the top of the mountain?
g:	to the left of the fort and level with the base of the wooden pole but not actually beside the wooden pole
M:	i'm going to take the time to look up the name of the lake
g:	yeah ehm do you have the pyramid
M:	go to the cottage then
g:	no you see the walled city
M:	
g:	then you go along
M:	no, you have to go to the graveyard
g:	okay until you for about two or three inches until you're about a centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
M:	right then
g:	right okay
M:	turn left now
g:	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
M:	is it possible to go east of the ice?
g:	past the the shelter that's over the top
M:	now pass the wall
g:	okay now should come to a do you have a monument
M:	yeah, just keep walking north till you get south
g:	okay
M:	yeah i can do that. do you want me to come back in a couple of hours?
g:	um to about just before the middle of the page
M:	i think it's on the final point
g:	yeah
M:	right, that's the way it is
g:	uh-huh i know
M:	you don't need to go any further
g:	ehm right do you know where go down about two inches okay
M:	gasp
g:	oh have you got an old pine tree sort of down diagonally right from the cliffs
M:	theres a few of them, i can't remember what they're called though
g:	he'll probably kill me here
M:	yeah i think so
g:	yeah if you just mm do you have a sort of the water coming down
M:	i don't know how to do it
g:	do you have the remote village
M:	i don't know

M:	left is a hole in the ground
g:	"right and then just where the word pine forest is just stop at the ""p"""
M:	about two inches
g:	do you have an old pine
M:	i'm in the east
g:	until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start
M:	i thought you said you were in canada?
g:	now you should come to a fenced meadow on your right
M:	okay i'm in the process of moving my car and the car is still there
g:	below the buffalo
M:	are you on the east coast?
g:	mm is that just right beneath it
M:	where do you want me to meet you?
g:	right beside it you just go straight down underneath it
M:	i can arrange it for you if you want
g:	now do you have a walled city
M:	and then go down further
g:	right now mm go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
M:	you can't build a graveyard, you have to build a river.
