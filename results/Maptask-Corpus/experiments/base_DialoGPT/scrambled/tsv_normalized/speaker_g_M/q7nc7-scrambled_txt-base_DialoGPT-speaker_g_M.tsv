g:	i want you to draw the line keep going to your right okay so you're sort of like drawing towards the top of the pine grove then stop and go from left to right in a diagonal underneath the pine grove
M:	i'm in the mountains so the map is in the middle of the mountains
g:	"go in a ""c""-shaped curve"
M:	i want you not to imagine
g:	right and then follow the crane bay round the coast
M:	huh uh
g:	right above the noose
M:	i don't understand what you mean
