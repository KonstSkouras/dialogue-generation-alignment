g:	right okay you see my boat house is to the left of the concealed hideout
M:	i know but you know what the map is
g:	right
M:	i'm not gonna lie i have a goldmine
g:	uh-huh
M:	the stone is at the bottom of the mountain above the hide out.
g:	yeah
M:	right i just got the map
g:	yeah probably yeah
M:	i don't know how to do that but i'm not sure how to make it work
g:	no
M:	up and to left
g:	to get past it yeah well draw that way
M:	i am just wondering how you did it
g:	oh you've got another boat house
M:	you're not gonna give me a good answer
g:	then you come straight down and right
M:	okay but i want you draw your lines
g:	go to your left 'til you're uh ah until you're level and then south so that you're just underneath it you should be above it
M:	okay then
g:	"go keep going up 'til you're about an inch below the ""x"" marks finish which i don't know if you have"
M:	i'm in the ravines, just walk around and you'll find me
g:	for about two centimetres
M:	i'll go
g:	no your left
M:	you have a grave
g:	far below it directly below it
M:	before the fort is reached
g:	no no no no
M:	it's on my left
g:	just ehm just about an inch above the starting cross
M:	under the bakery.
g:	or just to the right of it okay i want you to you see where it comes down like that
M:	i'm guessing they're all around the corner from me
g:	well just draw round it
M:	the north
g:	how far down
M:	i see a buffalo
g:	go down south and then do you have anything else between the fort and the cattle ranch
M:	i don't think so
g:	right then south
M:	how do you see it?
g:	no
M:	yes but you didnt get it
g:	well yeah well the great rock is level with the indian country and ehm in between the gold mine
M:	i'm not going to say anything
g:	go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left have you got a rocket warehouse
M:	and you want me to go fast
g:	right okay right have you got the crane bay
M:	yeah i know
g:	beneath the pine forest uh-huh
M:	you can see it from the way the rift came through
g:	so you do that again
M:	i don't know what that means
g:	uh-huh
M:	left side
g:	uh-huh and then come right back in
M:	but you can go up to the fallen pillar
g:	you go to your left obviously yes 'cause that's where the abandoned truck is now south so that you're just underneath it and just go to the end of the abandoned truck
M:	what's going to happen?
g:	oh two or three inches down from the pine forest okay you know it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields okay but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there above the bakery in other words above the eh
M:	you know the forest?
g:	sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there
M:	you're not allowed to go up
g:	"and then come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and a level with the ""c"" and maybe about an inch to west of the ""c"""
M:	how do i do that?
g:	keep drawing vertically
M:	i dont have a compass, i have a map
g:	no well have you got a collapsed shelter
M:	right? i'm not sure what to do
g:	and do you have a desert
M:	yes! i want to see the tree!
g:	right okay sorry that's the wrong one you don't wanna go anywhere near that one right
M:	you have a gold mining facility?
g:	okay
M:	i see
g:	well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks
M:	yes, but if you're on the right, you'll end up right on the far left
g:	oh
M:	what is the stone?
g:	right below the flat rocks
M:	and just like that, you're in
g:	turn right now okay do you have a fenced meadow
M:	huh? how do i do that?
g:	no
M:	oh no
g:	so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right
M:	i dont know
g:	and turn to your the west
M:	i'm just a bit more right now
g:	not not to the if you come have you come down past the caravan park
M:	that's a lot of up and down
g:	no you don't go to the bottom of the map
M:	the top is north
g:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
M:	i'm in the waterfall
g:	no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch
M:	where are you standing?
g:	right and see where the pebbled shore is
M:	which direction do you wanna go?
g:	right exactly right come across a tad 'til you are roughly a centimetre from the white mountain if you take a line up but not you know so that your line is the same direction that you took the line under the pyramid
M:	and you can't get to the top of the maps
g:	there's no
M:	left hand side of the edge
g:	if you know what i mean yeah
M:	yea i am, i can get on now
g:	no i've no got any canoes
M:	just the way it looks.
g:	well what have you got instead of a fenced meadow

M:	you can't
g:	right see the buffalo
M:	i have no idea
g:	okay
M:	vertical towards burnt forest and back
g:	just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there
M:	oh yeah
g:	if you know what i mean
M:	it's a secret

g:	"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean"
M:	okay, you can go over to the left and then the other way.
g:	go along the side of the trout farm
