g:	uh-huh
M:	yes but it's not a very good way to start
g:	need to go go up above it and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish
M:	i don't understand what you mean
g:	yes
M:	i'm a little confused.
g:	that should be on your left-hand side
M:	i don't know i don't have any idea.
g:	ah yeah back down the paper
M:	right and you are
g:	yes
M:	you're on a mountain and you're going south
g:	right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest
M:	i mean i am
g:	then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery
M:	i don't have a tree on the map
g:	and the indian country
M:	yeah just like that
g:	not not completely down just get past the avalanche right
M:	you can get them in the gold mines
g:	then travel to the east just past the antelopes
M:	i think it's a slate mountain but i'm not 100
g:	do you see the carved wooden pole
M:	how do you get to the burnt tree?
g:	okay moving down all the time
M:	do you curve?
g:	uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city
M:	i go right up
g:	an inch and a half if you draw that line down you'll be on the left-hand side of the forge you don't have a forge but there is one there
M:	yes i am
g:	you've go up and over the cattle ranch
M:	there is one in the bottom right corner
g:	okay
M:	i think you mean a cattle rancher
g:	okay then
M:	okay im in the saloons and ill go there and wait for you to come
g:	you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom
M:	can i stop?
g:	and then and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees
M:	i'm not sure what you're trying to say
g:	as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
M:	i don't get it
g:	uh-huh right
M:	like the ghost village
g:	mmhmm over the cattle ranch right
M:	it's just a little curve
g:	okay eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half
M:	you should have walked up to the pyramid and said you're sorry
g:	so that's where you want to end up
M:	so it's a river?
g:	and go to your right
M:	how far do you go?
g:	from where you are at the moment
M:	i'm in the south and i'm getting there
g:	yeah the cactus
M:	yes i know
g:	and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
M:	what's that
g:	and then back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to your abandoned truck just below it
M:	uhhh... huh...
g:	and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
M:	go left go right go right
g:	between the walled city and what
M:	i don't have flat rocks.
g:	do you have a graveyard
M:	and then
g:	right
M:	turns around and stands up you were supposed to come
g:	uh-huh
M:	i go up to the forge
g:	mmhmm and then north now have you got big white mountain
M:	i can do this but i can't do it right now
g:	right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
M:	you mean a steep slope?
g:	stop after you reach the just just right after you've gone under it okay
M:	i think you just got the joke
g:	okay from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit
M:	turn right so you can't get in
g:	i cannae see your hands fae here
M:	i think you can't go around the ravines on the ravins
g:	and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
M:	you can go along
g:	underneath the diamond mine
M:	just finished the antelope
g:	no well the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery
M:	i don't know what you're talking about there's a huge rock in the middle of the middle east.
g:	and then go back down to the side of it and underneath the bandit territory
M:	the flat rocks in the forest
g:	do you have the remote village
M:	do you want to finish just before the lake?
g:	no how far down's the manned fort
M:	i'm doing the opposite of that
g:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
M:	no you have canoes.
g:	okay if you now come down a couple of centimetres
M:	and back down
g:	underneath them
M:	yeah i am
g:	underneath the bakery
M:	uhhuh but then you have to go in a circle
g:	right see see where the flagship is
M:	ok then pass
g:	go along to the end of the cattle stockade
M:	then turn right
g:	there's a savannah right you want to travel east until you get to before the savannah
M:	right go go
g:	"just past the remote village and mark ""x"" 'cause that's us finished a complete trial"
M:	what size diamond mine are you mining?
g:	draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be
M:	go to the bottom of the hill
g:	go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get to stop just above the ravine
M:	i have a house
g:	then you turn left go
M:	uhuh uh uh
g:	yeah but i want you to draw up through between the cottage and the ravine
M:	yes sir
g:	right come due south from the edge of the footbridge straight south for about two inches
M:	i was not
g:	is that just beside the flagship yeah
M:	ohh yeah
g:	is there anything between the old temple and the truck
M:	i can't see the river. i want to see it.
g:	from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek
M:	ayy euw
g:	and just that's your cross is there that's it finished
M:	yes where is it?
g:	or hot springs
M:	where do you want to meet
g:	right underneath it and then just come back up 'til you're level with the top of the plant thing about a
M:	no it's not.
g:	right well when you when you're coming down the left-hand of the apache camp just keep heading along and go over the top of the walled city
M:	i am not sure how i can get it on the top of my head
g:	"no don't pass straight across right just curve downwards in a a ""u"" slight ""u"" a very very very slight curve and then pass upwards in a like an upside-down ""u"" because you want to avoid the cattle ranch which lies between the fort and the buffalo there's a cattle there's a cattle ranch"
M:	no i'm not sure what you're asking
g:	right sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
M:	i have no idea what you're talking about
g:	oh do you not have another one to your right of the concealed hideout
M:	have they gone to the wrong end?
g:	right
M:	i don't know how to get to the bottom
g:	right well sort of pretend there's a forge right below the cliffs right and instead of right so you go down round the bottom of the forge so like draw a sort of a pretend semicircle
M:	i mean what is the secret to the secret?
g:	do you have a graveyard just along from the diamond mine
M:	oh yeah
g:	just to below the shelter below the level of the shelter
M:	a forest
g:	well i want you to follow follow the line of the the coast there so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there
M:	i am not sure if you are aware of the difference between a bar and a salon bar.
g:	oh is it
M:	i can't
g:	do you have a cavalry
M:	where is it?
g:	past it
M:	you know what you need to do?
g:	underneath that and then heading across to the right to the trout farm
M:	the mountain
g:	and right through
M:	right i am
g:	erm mark no just wait i know you're thirsty but just wait 'til you get to the desert
M:	no it's not
g:	and then go straight do you have a cattle stockade
M:	yes you can
g:	uh-huh just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout
M:	but below the water
g:	yeah
M:	the one that's above the right side of the diamond farm
g:	below it
M:	i'm just gonna go ahead and stop right there right there
g:	and then continue straight left along until about four centimetres from the end and then go straight up again
M:	that's not there
g:	you go up the map past the abandoned cottage turn left
M:	yea i got it
g:	i see you'll have to go through the forest then
M:	its not that hard
g:	and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left
M:	i am not a smart man i just have the order down
g:	well just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact okay
M:	ok i have the redwood tree and the red wood bridge
g:	well that's okay right now take that take the line is the cottage directly beside the ravine
M:	i don't know how to do that.
g:	uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine
M:	it's pretty good but the cobbled streets are not very good
g:	so just do that
M:	i think i've found the end
g:	oh you've got a different boat house i've got two boat houses
M:	turn around
g:	well have you got fallen pillars
M:	yes i do
g:	mm right okay is that sort of above the lighthouse
M:	i don't know where to go but i'm going to the top
g:	just take it a wee bit further across so that you'll clear the remote village
M:	what about the crane bay?
g:	"and then straight across until you're below the ""e"""
M:	i dont know how to go about it
g:	well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city
M:	what are you trying to do?
g:	now have you got anything down that side
M:	turn left then turn right
M:	so where is it?
