g:	and along the bottom yeah to the left of it
M:	i will
g:	right you're just heading along past that you see the flat rocks
M:	there's a way
g:	you're going quite far down maybe wait a second what do you have underneath the gold mine anything
M:	right, right straight down the start then you're in the bottom of the start?
g:	where's the one at the top
M:	i can't find any.
g:	it's right ehm go right along to about an inch from the end of the paper
M:	not anymore
g:	right okay ehm right so you're where are you now then
M:	that's the rift river valley, right?
g:	from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove
M:	i'm a bit far away but i'll try and see what i can do
g:	no i haven't got a stream i suppose just avoid the stream but sort of like as though
M:	uhhh... the goldmine
g:	ehm and go right underneath them
M:	oh, i'm gonna be going to the end of the island to the middle of the ocean
g:	sort of curving round now see stone creek
M:	no, i can't, i don't have stone.
g:	abandoned cottage yes yes
M:	i live in the valley and have been looking for a cave with a rock creek
g:	mmhmm
M:	i'll be on my way
g:	now you turn left towards the middle of the page
M:	i'm trying to get to the point where i want to hit a guy right in the face
g:	you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	how do i do that
g:	just down at the side just straight down
M:	i have a lot of them
g:	right well it doesn't doesn't matter
M:	it's a ravine.
g:	you got to you've got to pass below the flat rocks
M:	how do you get that?
g:	no
M:	and the face of the tree
g:	uh-huh and then back to the left
M:	yes and no
g:	okay er the lake should have a a bulge in it just at the top
M:	you can go into the caravan and go through the door and then go through it again
g:	and then go straight across another inch and that's the finish
M:	right and then go backwards to the back of the truck
g:	keep going
M:	the lake
g:	right
M:	then turn left!
g:	well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve
M:	you're wrong, it's three hundred and sixty
g:	go go back so that you'll just miss the remote village if you come south
M:	i'm sure it's not, but i'm sure you could tell from the way it's shaped.
g:	aye aye
M:	okay, just keep it up, i'm not a big fan of the bandits, i prefer the way the band is laid out.
g:	to its left well that's a a stone ss
M:	u got 2 btw
g:	you want to just go over the top of that and round
M:	i'll be there in a minute
g:	so the abandoned cottage should now be below you on the map
M:	no stone creek?
g:	uh do you have a rope bridge
M:	you're in the wrong country.
g:	you've got a bay there
M:	so you can get to the museum of freedom
g:	no
M:	but what if you turn right?
g:	okay and then just like a nice big curve heading down about six inches
M:	of the camp
g:	okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
M:	the whole thing is a lie
g:	the remote village is about
M:	yes, there is
g:	mmhmm
M:	come to the village
g:	right okay then right you're going to go below the diamond mine
M:	i'll let you know when i'm ready
g:	a totem pole sort of thing
M:	then curve
g:	now do you have a footbridge
M:	no im pretty sure i am
g:	it's it's in the finishing point
M:	it is a bit hard to read
g:	okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields
M:	i'll be the guy who goes to the lake and takes the water
g:	right do you have a cobbled street
M:	the left one
g:	imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you
M:	i'll go up there and do it for you
g:	you no got two fenced meadows
M:	i have a compass in the middle of the river, so i can see where i am going
g:	but above the carved wooden pole and above the stone creek
M:	you come straight up and down
g:	right go south past buffalo
M:	i think it's more to do with the angle of the picture
g:	well do you have an apache camp
M:	then turn right
g:	crane bay
M:	i can try to get a pic of it
g:	horizontally sorry
M:	so what you're saying is that the top is my house?
g:	right no below the flat rocks
M:	you are going to have to leave
g:	"sort of ""c"" shape to cover the bottom of a ""c"" right from when you pass down below the walled city"
M:	now you're going into the wrong bar
g:	the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
M:	i have a boat house.
g:	no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
M:	just don't go in too far
g:	do you have concealed hideout
M:	go straight up then go down
g:	and stone slabs
M:	right in line at the top
g:	right okay
M:	i have a fire
g:	right okay right what you do then is you go south from the walled city
M:	i'll be there
g:	and then travel south and then
M:	no, i don't
