g:	yeah
M:	ok i'll try that
g:	no do you have pebbled shore
M:	right till you get a little bit of elevation
g:	that's right
M:	yes i do
g:	so ehm ehm i'm kind of stuck
M:	you know the right of the pines
g:	right well go down towards the coast
M:	so how many times have you done this
g:	okay
M:	goin for the bay
g:	right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face
M:	i think it's the top of stone creek and the top right of stonecreek
g:	uh we turn right there at that bulge okay since you don't have a trig point we'll use that instead
M:	yeah what about it?
g:	okay if you just get to the waterfall first and then you want to go straight up to where these lost steps are
M:	i don't know where i'm going from here
g:	ehm straight down from that have you got an actual wee bay there like curves
M:	i'm not sure i think i have a graveyard but i don't know for sure
g:	right you've come through the forest
M:	i am
g:	right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage can you do that
M:	yea sure
g:	underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page
M:	i'm on
g:	you've got a lake now you skirt around the inside side of the lake that's side of the lake that is nearest to the middle of the map
M:	uhhhh... yes.
g:	i think you're on the wrong one
M:	no its just a regular ravine that i built
g:	you got another stone creek
M:	right where the bridge ends
g:	are you
M:	uhh what?
g:	and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean
M:	how high are you?
g:	mm
M:	it's fine. i just don't like to be caught in the middle of a river when i'm on the foot bridge
g:	no
M:	yes touching
g:	okay i want you go down about three inches
M:	yea im fine
g:	right you just want to curve up the left-hand side of the fort just curve a nice big curve round it
M:	oh yeah
g:	about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're
M:	i think i've found a goldmine
g:	edge of the map
M:	and you have to go north for a mile to the north
g:	aye
M:	you wanna go round up
g:	right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
M:	i don't know what you're talking about.
g:	you turn round to a abandoned cottage so always keeping it on your left-hand side
M:	and you can do it on a wooden board and it's a very quick and easy
g:	and then so you get to the top of the pine tree
M:	yeah...
g:	uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove
M:	like where are you going?
g:	okay
M:	oh yeah i did that right
g:	before you reach the fort
M:	where is the little blue circle at the bottom right?
g:	i i don't suppose you've got a graveyard have you
M:	i'll do it but i'll have to go to work now
g:	and do you have a remote village
M:	i mean i would but i have no clue what that is
g:	is that okay
M:	its not a minecraft server
g:	so you're trying to avoid that so go down a little bit 'til just underneath where the indian country is
M:	i don't know what to do now
g:	ah there's no lemon grove in this one
M:	yeah i think so
g:	right start right so you're just below the cliffs
M:	you can just go to the bottom and you can do the final finish
g:	right where are you now then
M:	the banana tree is there
g:	but you know beneath the start
M:	you should start a thread
g:	you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley
M:	i'm in the east
g:	and then go to your right
M:	so just stop right there
g:	right
M:	yes yes i do
g:	so you want to come down from the mountain and turn sharp left
M:	so... how far?
g:	no but right the way over
M:	east east
g:	eh right um you're quite close to the mountain at the moment on its right-hand side
M:	yes mister
g:	hmm have you got the pebbled shore
M:	i dont get it
g:	you're drawing your line down
M:	theres a rock in between two rocks?
g:	okay you should see a trig point do you see
M:	the one on the right is the one on top
g:	ah yeah and go up to the left of the north temple of the old temple go north to the left of the old temple
M:	there is a very small fish in the middle of the tree
g:	okay you keep going up there
M:	right i can do that
g:	mm-mm
M:	not a problem i just have to draw a tree
g:	ah right do you have a poisoned stream directly east
M:	are you coming up to camp?
g:	then you want to start like carry on that curve for about four or five inches just gradually heading up the way right
M:	you're welcome.
g:	uh-huh
M:	do you have a beefy beefy cattle stockades?
g:	uh-huh you just
M:	what do you mean?
g:	mmhmm and come back round on yourself 'til you get to
M:	to the left
g:	no
M:	just be on top of it
g:	worry too much about the exact
M:	i don't think so
g:	see your apache camp
M:	you know
g:	no i don't have the ravine
M:	so go over that and go over it again
g:	right
M:	and up the left
g:	in like length further down from that on the page
M:	i'm confused
g:	ehm uh-huh yes more or less but don't go as far as that
M:	i can't tell if you're joking or not
g:	mmhmm
M:	i'm on my way!
g:	you're drawing a nose right say this is the face you're drawing and then you've got to sort of do a sort of round bit for the nose
M:	how far down is it?
g:	just like just more a wee bit more than a straight line along past the diamond mine
M:	ok umm i think i have to go buy a new one
g:	then go up to almost the very top of the page
M:	but the rock is down a bit
g:	but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
M:	okay im at the plaza
g:	mmhmm right got your antelopes
M:	okay
M:	just to the far east
