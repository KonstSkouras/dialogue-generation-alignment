g:	right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
M:	but... what about the antelope?
g:	well yeah that would be okay
M:	I'm a baby.
g:	about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters
M:	right look where the bay is
g:	oh yeah you you you keep you go down and then you go left right you you right uh i don't suppose you've got the balloons the baboons
M:	up and then right

M:	I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.
g:	well that's wrong then
M:	i dont have'x'marks finished
g:	yeah over the top
M:	I'll keep this one.
g:	in a curve above the carved stones
M:	the one in the back
g:	'til you're right above the wigwams
M:	just stop
g:	ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
M:	I'm pretty sure that's the top of the ocean
g:	right up above it
M:	i mean like on the top
g:	okay right ehm have you got the boat house
M:	you should have waited for the last minute, you could have had a chance to get the achievement
g:	aye that'll be where my that'll be where my stone labs that'll be where my stone slabs are
M:	no I mean the line, not the wheat field
g:	just stop at the old lighthouse uh-huh
M:	you could just use a portal to the ancient ruin
g:	or a swamp to its left
M:	I have a horse, you can have a dragon.
g:	yes your right-hand edge my left-hand edge
M:	start at the foot bridge
g:	cottage round yes
M:	okay i can do that
g:	uh-huh and that's just situated above the ravine
M:	i go to the pyramid and then south
g:	yeah more or less
M:	left right
g:	now are go straight across to the abandoned truck and then come south so that you're just underneath it
M:	that's what i meant, i meant the ones that are on the top and they're not in the top left
g:	on your map no well the
M:	i can't think of anything
g:	i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top
M:	that's where the pyramid is
g:	and you've got the lost steps
M:	what are you talking about?
g:	is there a space between them yeah
M:	no, it's the diamond
g:	uh-huh
M:	yeah but what if I'm in a boat
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	so i'm not wrong?
g:	well
M:	I'll finish the first thing I see in the map, but you'll have to finish the second thing first
g:	right to the very end of paper
M:	I have fallen pillars, which are lost steps?
g:	don't go round about it just go up before it
M:	i don't
g:	so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
M:	i think you mean a bit more
g:	right and then you go up the inside of the pine tree
M:	okay im in the middle of a drawing
g:	right so so we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideout
M:	right ok okay
g:	okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
M:	oh okay.
g:	"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid"
M:	yes and i have the sword
g:	do you have white water
M:	I have a bridge
g:	i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about
M:	ok, do you know how to build a rope?
g:	well like you know a pretend loop
M:	I told you I'd go to the old house and go around the side of the old cottage you go around to the side
g:	until you get to a kind of level above the shelter
M:	I can't believe I just watched this.
g:	mmhmm
M:	i dont know how to do this
g:	right not no that the left of the pine tree so the that's outside of the map
M:	but i'm still stuck on the forest and i don't know what to do
g:	straight north to up to the level with the bottom of the lake
M:	right and east are the same
g:	just beyond crest falls
M:	left?
g:	and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave
M:	To the right of the top gazelle
g:	yes
M:	not if i have anything to say about it
g:	great ehm okay head up ehm past stone creek you need to be going at about up curving up to the right at about a forty-five degree angle
M:	I have a car.
g:	so now you're about
M:	ohh... well...
g:	is it sort of underneath the cattle stockade
M:	right i'm going to do it
g:	right well just go a little curve above it
M:	have you washed stones?
g:	on the left-hand side okay so where are you now
M:	are you sure?
g:	no do you have a saloon bar
M:	left straight up?
g:	you going to hit it
M:	i can't get them to work
g:	uh-huh
M:	try clicking on the bottom of the map
g:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
M:	and do you want to go to the eastward
g:	so draw your line to the right horizontally above the ravine okay then do you have a pine forest
M:	the cactus?
g:	right
M:	uhh, what's that?
g:	to your right uh-huh
M:	so you know
g:	uh-huh right do you have the remote village

M:	i have everything else in the area
g:	right now have you got the hot wells
M:	before I get to the fort.
g:	don't have a graveyard
M:	yeah i know but i just want to get out of the straight line and into the city
g:	yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left
M:	there is a crane bay?
g:	oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout
M:	right side of course
g:	good right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout right do you see where in can you see crane bay
M:	and the fallen steps
g:	what
M:	it's a bot
g:	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the
M:	you mean the one on the bottom right?
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	we can go back
g:	uh-huh but right have oh god right where are you now again
M:	im sure it will be a great finish but i just want to know if i can finish the final one
g:	vertically right past burnt forest
M:	well i've been doing it for a while and i'm still curving it
g:	mmhmm
M:	straight up?
g:	yeah
M:	i'm going to the abandoned shack
g:	ah we better score them out then
M:	go south and do you
g:	and about about an inch away from the end of the sheet of paper
M:	its just a hideout, so you can hide in the water and not risk drowning
g:	where are your uh-huh you should be about a couple of inches below it but not directly under it
M:	uhh, what do you mean by that?
g:	on the left-hand side of it
M:	I have the same problem.
g:	okay
M:	yes to the left of the center of the screen
g:	'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a
M:	I think the new mill has a better layout.
