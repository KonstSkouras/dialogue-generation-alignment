g|right do you have a boat house to your left
M|how do you go up?
g|right go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge
M|i think i just have to do the same thing
g|that's right
M|i dont have a tree there
g|mmhmm
M|you mean to the left of the abandoned creeper farm?
g|to the edge of the page
M|right now
g|now do you have a white mountain
M|i want to avoid the downvotes
g|now have you got baboons
M|i can do it
g|so come along to about mm about five six inches anyway straight along to the right
M|in the corner
g|and then the finish is just ehm on a horizontal with the flagship near to the coast about a centimetre away from the coast
M|uhhh, you're going to have to explain that one to me.
g|in between the rope bridge and the waterfall
M|i'll take it back
g|well just draw in a diagonal to your left
M|how do you get up there?
g|well i want you to avoid that
M|oh my god that's amazing
g|over the pine
M|where's the blue line?
g|well er you know imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's it's on mine but imagine where it would be
M|what if you're on the right hand side?
g|turn left so that's two turns left after you come out the caravan park
M|mmhhmm it has a good reputation
g|and then
M|I'm in the old Mill now.
g|right well see ah about an inch above the abandoned truck that is where you should be
M|right do you want me to take it back to the nose
g|well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit
M|and what are you going to do about it?
g|underneath the bakery and maybe in past the bakery about two centimetres just before the canal have you got a canal
M|huhuh uh
g|and be at this at
M|for a minute
g|due south to level at the bottom of crest falls that sounded like a long line ken
M|do u have a graveyard?
g|and left back up into the map
M|what about the start of the hill?
g|go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it
M|at the top
g|sorry
M|left on the flat rock
g|then left again so you're coming down the side of the caravan park
M|I'm going to make you a camper
g|sorry no i said a graveyard
M|how far?
g|come down just past the remote village
M|I'm going to make it a rocket
g|and and do you have a cattle ranch
M|i'll come back
g|to the side down by the side of the wigwams underneath this great rock
M|go north
g|okay
M|okay, just tell me when you're ready
g|well but
M|we'll see
g|you've passed twice should pass it again on your left
M|im in the forge
g|do you have gazelles
M|i have an acme and a scythe
g|yeah
M|how far along is the salon bar?
g|so that you want to come up the page and then just when you're about in line with the rope rope bridge just turn right so you're across it
M|i'm not sure where it is
g|right and then down underneath the fort sort of um to your left
M|You turn left and then turn right so you get the train.
g|and below the graveyard below the graveyard but above the carved wooden pole
M|i have the canoes and canoes, i can't get the canoe, but i can get the canoe and canoe
g|okay
M|what are you trying to accomplish?
g|no straight across until
M|huh?
g|right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like
M|yeah i'm pretty sure i have a few of those in my inventory
g|uh-huh right and then have you got a forge underneath the cliffs
M|I love how you can hear the sound of a man trying to hear his own mind.
g|uh-huh
M|what level?
g|two inches above it
M|i don't get it
g|uh-huh it's just a slight curve
M|i would say that it's a bit of a stretch to call it a totem pole, but i guess that's just me
g|you should really end up about four inches down from the the cross er you know in the same line like just beneath it in fact four inches down okay
M|right...
g|uh-huh
M|we have a border
M|i guess we'll have to agree to disagree then.
