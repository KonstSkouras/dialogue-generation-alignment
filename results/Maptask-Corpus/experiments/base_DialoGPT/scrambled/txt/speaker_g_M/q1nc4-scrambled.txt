g|mmhmm right quite far down
M|so you wanna help me out?
g|be careful for the old mill you'll see it it should be on your right-hand side
M|mm have you seen the lake?
g|yeah okay um do you have a soft furnishings store
M|ok, I'll be there
g|uh-huh
M|you're right
g|yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint
M|ok then its towards the to right it's toward the to a a
g|if you sort of head along
M|it's a tree
g|away at the other side right you're heading to go under that but like on your way about halfway between the buffalo and the fort there's a wee blip in your line
M|I'm good
g|no go go down under your manned fort and then
M|i mean i'm going to try it right now
g|you're right up beside that
M|um, and then the right
g|the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore
M|I'm pretty sure it's just under concealment.
g|okay that's fine now you've got the rope bridge
M|theres a pyramid in the center of the map
g|and you want to come south and round the antelopes
M|right, but the point is just right.
g|no just up so that you're you're coming away from it up towards the top of the paper
M|ok I'll be there in a few minutes
g|right and then are you sort of above the "e" in crane bay
M|The old temple is the abandoned one.
g|yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon
M|okay then, I'll try to find it
g|okay now right look down to the crane bay right
M|you mean under the diamond mines?
g|right go east and go north west of the old you know go north just to the west of the old temple
M|uhh where do you go?
g|on the same level
M|you got it
g|do you have a white mountain further up
M|right, so what is the best way to get the pyramid to the top?
g|yeah okay
M|i have a new weapon
g|but you haven't gone far enough across so that you're so that if you came south you'd hit the white mountain
M|It's not a crime to be a little bit crazy.
g|right just keep going 'til the end
M|go north
g|well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there
M|I'm sorry I'm not a native english speaker
g|uh-huh if you had a great rock as if you're going underneath it
M|and a pine tree
g|eh take your line down to crane bay oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway so you get to the canal right you don't have one but just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve okay of crane bay
M|What does a compass do?
g|past the diamond mine not that not that steep a curve like just
M|do i have a farm
g|to the left
M|i'm on the right
g|right and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop
M|what do you mean?
g|yeah i don't want you to go near the river at all
M|ok, where's the left side of your page?
g|well never mind you should be on the left-hand side of it but it should be on your left-hand side
M|how come?
g|right is there a pyramid
M|I was told it was supposed to be a pond
g|okay
M|yeah i got the stones
g|oh three hundred sixty
M|no, but i have a forest
g|before you reach the fort
M|oh, yeah, i just realized that
g|have you got a bay at the bottom
M|h
g|go round the monument keeping the monument always on your left
M|I'm so sorry.
g|right now well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the "a" and the come up to make that a "u" shape
M|ok i'll be on the way
g|yeah
M|i want you in the boat
g|yeah
M|m'lady '

g|yeah a single old pine
M|Where is it?
g|oh you're at the walled city

g|then back up and above the gold mine
M|you're going to be stuck in the desert for a while
g|right just go round enough so you're like in a above them
M|the air vent is the air vent
g|right so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no right have you got anything below pebbled shore
M|right i am going up north, i am just going up the tree
g|the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished
M|what do you mean go straight east to the truck?
g|uh-huh well say the top's north and
M|I'm pretty sure it's in the middle of the map.
g|no that's right okay now we turn right again okay and you go up the map you should come to a lake
M|i was going to do that, but i didn't want to get caught in the avalanche and have to go to my to my right
g|that's you going across to the other side of the map
M|left, right, left, right
g|then so you're coming down the side of the caravan park
M|yup and then u
g|uh-huh
M|and the same goes for the hot springs.
g|right you well right you're going past you're going up over stone creek and your line's just about touching where flat rocks is written
M|yeah but i can't get up there because it's a firepit
g|to to the left of the page not not right along i mean it in a i mean in a left direction
M|about 2 inches
g|right don't go right right you can go a bit further about another inch
M|you can go straight up, you'll hit the sea
g|and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and and down about you know two and a half inches three inches
