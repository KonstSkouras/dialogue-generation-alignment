g|uh-huh
M|you want to go west?
g|right okay well you're going to curve round them right have you got the flagship
M|you can go up to the wall and just walk up to it
g|but don't actually go near them
M|i am on my phone, i don't know what i'm talking about
g|thought you did
M|how would you get the top right side of a page?
g|okay you got the lake
M|Uhh, on the right side of that page
g|continue south
M|and over the left side
g|until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
M|i'm at the start of the mountain
g|yeah but stop when you get just to above the bakery
M|i think you're going too far
g|go along to the the left
M|right where
g|okay erm
M|I don't think you know what a line is
g|right do you have to the left of the indian country a great rock
M|I have a torch and a torch.
g|uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then
M|where is the cross?
g|just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M|where is the line?
g|uh-huh right round them and back down towards the indian country
M|i know what you mean
g|right and then go between the flat rocks and the stone creek okay can you do that you pass in a pass
M|i can do that, i'll be on in a bit
g|to the west of the antelopes
M|right i just wanna know how far the cross is
g|now you're going along
M|okay, I'll just go in there and check
g|i'll keep it english
M|yeah, yeah, yeah.
g|yee-ha okay
M|that's how you get stuck on the bottom of the lake
g|right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
M|Where do you live?
g|no go just until you go go below the diamond mine until just before the fast fast flowing river
M|I think you mean the c
g|okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath
M|I'm on the right.
g|okay
M|You're stuck
g|and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
M|i don't even know where that is
g|then do you have ancient ruins
M|you mean to the right?
g|oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek
M|it's a bit of a circle, so it looks like the one you're trying to get across is a bit out of the way.
g|uh-huh uh-huh
M|how do you say that?
g|right and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper
M|you wanna go?
g|you weren't meant to
M|I am in the waterfall and i am going straight up
g|well you slope down with the pine forest on your right
M|yes, and then we will start to build a house
g|until you're just below the "a"
M|right right
g|go up past the monument
M|I'm guessing you are in the bottom right corner?
g|right well go past the buffalo
M|right over the fort?
g|do you have carved stones
M|what are you talking about
g|now curve round draw a curve until you're below the "r" of remote
M|there is a hill at the bottom
g|yeah down below it
M|and THEN have you been lost in the water?
g|the roman baths
M|what if I just go to the bottom right?
g|goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs
M|no its not
g|okay 'cause you're going to go you're about an a centimetre above the pebbled shore and you're going to go along the top of the pebbled shore
M|yeah, i mean i dont have anything down
g|right what you're trying to do is avoid the totem pole
M|i'm going to be doing the whole thing in the temple
g|and then you want to go sharp right
M|I am not good at drawing.
g|just a a couple of inches and then west
M|i'm coming back
g|and then go up and over the top of where the creek is
M|I'm confused, the first line from a cross, the second line from an enemy
g|you turn left
M|so i guess i'm the only one that thinks this is a good idea
g|no bottom right-hand corner of the boat house
M|i think you need to add one more letter
g|can you go between the pine grove and the avalanche
M|get to the hidden hideout and you'll be fine
g|okay so i want you to imagine i want you to imagine that the remote village is there just to the right of the burnt forest right so it's kind of like in a triangle
M|what level are you?
g|to the bottom of the cliffs
M|and then the other way
g|moving eh left
M|you need to draw a line between
g|okay you got that
M|i dont know
g|no don't go don't go below the wooden pole
M|the map is in a tree
g|never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything
M|ok im moving now
g|and then go round in a curve underneath the diamond mine
M|uhhhhhhhhhhh
g|and go uh-huh no well i don't know where's your where's your washed stones
M|well, I am you
g|well
M|Do you have any horses?
g|right on my map there's a slate mountain you're traveling north
M|huh what?
g|okay
M|now come south
g|to the to the left it's towards the "c" of crane bay
M|yes yes
g|above the right below the buffalo below the buffalo right
M|what side of the map?
g|head for that and we'll be okay no ehm see the outlaws' hideout
M|yes i can
g|at at the bandit territory
M|yea right go right over
g|no you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
M|they all have a lot of stones creek and jasper, i would say thats a good spot
g|hmm antelopes
M|yeah, let's go
g|uh-huh so we've made a mistake you
M|turn left
g|you're just above it have you come down
M|where are you going?
g|straight down and then left
M|how do i get to the fort?
g|why
M|I know what you mean.
g|pass them on your their left
M|where are you going?
g|map right
M|You would be surprised how many people think the world is a flat
g|yeah below and then like into the rift valley
M|you can't go up there
g|right
M|oh, you're right.
g|well just draw the arc and stop the arc you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest okay
M|ok fine
g|is that you
M|the map has been drawn
g|aha so don't go round the pine forest just like pass down by it
M|I am in a tent
g|aye right okay so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing
M|so then the truck goes down the hill to the truck, then back up
g|do you have a fort
M|do you just roll around on the paper and pray for the best?
g|uh-huh
M|far away
g|right have you got the coconut palm
M|ok, how far do i need to go?
g|okay you go up round the uh abandoned cottage
M|right ok so i am at the bottom right corner of rapids and you are at the left
g|keep going down
M|right i'll try that
g|right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right
M|i think it's just the foot bridge
g|do you see a cattle ranch no
M|i have a little bit of water coming up the side of the lake.
g|okay uh-huh
M|then do another one
g|alright now and come down below them
M|it's a joke
g|you'll miss the lost steps
M|uhhhmmm... hmmm...
g|yeah
M|right what am i looking at
g|yeah you're heading from the indian country to the gold mine but trying to avoid the gold rock so come down to the bottom of
M|the pyramid is not the only thing that is curved
g|no
M|no, i have a graveyard
g|okay
M|they are too hot
g|right so what you're going to is curve round your stones there and your the finish is just ehm about a centimetre from that black line that's marking the crane bay just directly across from the ship
M|it's in the middle of the cliff
g|right you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page okay
M|oh okay
g|you don't okay then so just go south and then straight along underneath the fort
M|i'll do that and then i'll get back to you
g|so you've anyway after you've turned around the cottage
M|if you don't mind i'll trade you my fenrir for a stone mountain
g|yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
M|the line of the tree and the line of a ship.
g|yes
M|there is no end
g|well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout
M|i've come across plenty of people who have gone far too
g|uh-huh and then och take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
M|not touching it
g|ten inches get away i don't know if i'd say that do you have the abandoned truck
M|what about the one above it?
g|right oh well i don't have this on my map so ehm do you have flat rocks
M|I don't want to be stuck in a cliff
g|yes
M|and start and stop and start and start again
g|and then just in a sort of virtual straight line past the bar mark
M|mmmhmmm...
g|a straight line
M|move north
g|right and then go vertically across to about two thirds across the page
M|yes but i can't use my old pine or a new pine
g|okay right i that's fine right i want you to go draw to your to your right under the pine grove avoiding the avalanche
M|mfw i don't have antelope
g|have you done that then
M|but then you have to go to the outlaw club
g|so that you're sort of in line with the left-hand side of the mountain
M|i'm just gonna say that this is a nice thing to do
g|it goes down to where it says cliffs okay
M|
g|do you have a swan pond
M|and above the ghost village
g|okay then so you're about so once right where are you now
M|left the page to draw a line
g|yeah right round it uh-huh
M|open and shut case
g|down south again until just above the apache camp
M|oh ok sorry no i just found a diamond ore on the bottom left of the map
M|I'll make a video
