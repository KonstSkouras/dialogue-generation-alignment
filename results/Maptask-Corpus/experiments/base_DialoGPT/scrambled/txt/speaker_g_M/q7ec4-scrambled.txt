M|and then i'm going to the bottom of the tree
g|uh-huh
M|understood, what is it going to?
g|right travel straight up north 'til you get just above the hot wells make sure you've cleared the the height of it
M|ok now do you want me to teach you how to ride a mountain
g|aye quite why you want to go there i don't know but
M|you come down the caravan
g|and you want to go right round about the lake
M|i'm gonna be on the opposite side of the lake
g|right well sort of sticking to the coast you know where the coast goes up and down vertical
M|how do you do that?
g|yeah just stop
M|i dont know how to take a picture of a ravine, it was the ravines fault

M|You're right, I should draw the right way down
g|no no
M|i can help u in a sec
g|no no it's okay now if you just uh at the top there's some stones and that's about four centimetres from the top
M|in the shelter, above the shelter...
g|oh that's fair enough right just just go between those two
M|turn left
g|the right yeah well you're getting from underneath the totem pole above which is above the great rock
M|i did

M|now do it again and again and so forth and so again
g|then go right underneath the cottage
M|go down through the ravines
g|you've come out about a centimetre from
M|i don't know if you have a rock creek above the white water but it's not a rock
g|that's it finished
M|turn around and back up
g|right
M|huh u just
g|right what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat house
M|when you are coming down
g|right go straight up north
M|the cactus?
g|right you want to go sure you don't have a lake
M|no they don't
g|right that should be just above the bakery
M|i think i know where that totem is but i can't remember where it is
g|all right right just come in two centimetres towards the middle
M|what do you mean?
g|if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars
M|oh so you're in the ravines right now?
g|there's no banana tree in this one
M|i'm not sure i can do that, i'm trying to get up, so i keep coming down and i'm still going down
g|right what about do you have an abandoned truck
M|i'll give it a shot, but i'm not sure if i can get the original version of the temple, and the new one is a bit too long
g|aye
M|ok i'll try to be there
g|right then travel west again
M|oh so i'm a hundred degrees

g|go down the left-hand side of the page once you've done that
M|i have a creek, i've had a river, and i've been a river for a while.
g|mmhmm until you're like at the bottom of the kind of level with the bottom of the desert
M|yea but the joke is that you're going to the wrong way up there
g|emerging at the left-hand side of the fort and you've to finish opposite the base more or less opposite the base of the carved wooden pole
