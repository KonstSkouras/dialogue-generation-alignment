g|so you're about an inch away from the edge of the sheet of paper
M|right where you want them
g|okay that's it
M|i just hit the bottom of the rift valley
g|and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge
M|but the line is just too far to the right
g|and then down south again
M|ok then
g|okay so you don't have a graveyard do you have a fast flowing river
M|the two little wheatfields
g|up the map you'll then come to an abandoned cottage it should be on your left-hand side
M|no i mean like a little bit down
g|to to the right of concealed hideout
M|yeah i know. but im just saying that i have come to the right place.
g|the "e" in village sorry
M|yeah, just go to the south east
g|okay right you're meant to come down from the start
M|the curve is a little steep for me
g|right right have you got the concealed hideout
M|now it's at the bottom of the screen
g|right you're going to go straight down eh straight down to the crane bay
M|u have a boat
g|ah right right head down the right sand hand side of the paper and curve underneath the buffalo
M|you mean you haven't passed it?
g|right head down towards that and then just curve down the left-hand side that
M|yes sir
g|uh-huh okay and then do you have anything underneath pine grove
M|no it's a long way to the right
g|and you follow a sort of curve ehm how do you describe the last south sort of from go in a
M|I'm gonna try and get there
g|okay and that's you
M|i dont see anything
g|you don't have a forge well the forge is eh below the the cliffs say about two inches down okay so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve
M|so... how far can I go?
g|of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres
M|i dont know where i am, i dont know what i am doing, i am just in the right place
g|right do you have the cobbled street
M|right past burnt mountain
g|okay keep going 'til you find a lake
M|I'm in the boat with you.
g|and then draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain
M|its a bit further away but it's a little further
g|is that right
M|canoe or canoes?
g|route but eh
M|ok well ill be on later today if you still want to trade
g|can you manage that
M|yes and i'm not near the pinegrove
g|no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left
M|i have a pool to the right of the saloons bar
g|do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point
M|yeah i've got a diamond mine, and it's in the diamond mines
g|until you get to the hot wells
M|the rift valley is the rift river
g|a pine grove uh-huh
M|I'm pretty sure that's not it.
g|to the right of them
M|you got a fast running river?
g|you don't have a trig point
M|u are a little slow
g|right and eh then it's sort of have you got wheatfields
M|that's the bay.
g|well okay do you have any flat rocks
M|oh okay
g|right have you got the lake
M|the only thing i can think of is the diamond mining part
g|so that you're about in line with the bottom of the water
M|you can't change the map...
g|is there
M|nah, it's the slope on the left
g|no don't go over the top of them
M|what is the best way to do that?
g|right at about at the level of the top of the fort right in line with the top of the fort
M|left is the left edge
g|you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're
M|yes and then
g|and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page
M|i am drawing a face i think
g|should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay
M|just wait till i get back
g|right i don't have that
M|he walks past the door and gets in
g|right then pass pass below the ghost town
M|yes i have the red one
g|well you weren't meant to
M|i dont think so
g|mmhmm now go up about two and a half inches do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there
M|what about the trout?
g|without actually coming into contact with them
M|on the top of the mountain
g|keeping it always on your left
M|ok so i'll just leave the antelopes and the antels to the left of the lake?
g|to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
M|is this a joke
g|okay you're
M|what do you mean
g|no well yeah slightly to its right there's some stone slabs
M|i'm right handed
g|right that's it finished
M|just go between the two
g|and then up north
M|theres a little waterfall going up from a bit of the top right corner
g|uh-huh
M|I'm pretty sure that's the end.
g|and then
M|its right below the beach
g|right and then the path the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge now do you have a poisoned stream there
M|the rocket part?
g|and then change to going due north for about three inches
M|You'll be fine.
