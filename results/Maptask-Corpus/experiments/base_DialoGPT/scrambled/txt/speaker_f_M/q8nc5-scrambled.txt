f|right
M|how do you do that?
f|round the bakery
M|in the middle of the pillars?
f|right
M|the head is the same as the body

M|i am now
f|right i've come up by the abandoned cottage right i was heading straight up the map towards the top of the blackboard
M|yeah you can, i think you have to be in a certain area to do it
f|so this is about a ten inch line from the where i am just now
M|just east of the level, east of a level.
f|but it's sort of nearer the cattle stockade but roughly in the middle cattle
M|how far along am i
f|right
M|ok i'll get on in a sec
f|the inside
M|you can see crane beach
f|yeah okay
M|what is that

M|it's a wagon wheel.
f|how far do you west do you want me to go
M|you are right
f|oh
M|aye, but the forest

f|right
M|yeah it's the last one
f|am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks
M|is it there?
f|above or below the trout farm
M|you can't curve the tree in the way you curve it
f|it runs
M|is it okay?
f|well my left yeah paper left uh-huh right
M|yeah i know what that is, i was just curious
f|right
M|I don't think you have.
f|well above it anyway on no wait a minute i have got flat rocks
M|yeah, i think i'm gonna try to avoid it
f|so do i move to the left-hand or the right-hand side of the gazelles
M|just follow the cranes
f|so right over to the end of the page
M|uhhhh... what?
f|yeah
M|the bottom of it is a cave, i know that's not there

M|its just a small radius
f|yeah right okay right
M|there are fenced areas
f|right as if i was going underneath the gold rock if it if i had it there
M|I've been in the back of the line for like a week and a half now.
f|uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit
M|if you want to go back to the abandoned house, you can go to the other side of the cliff
f|right
M|theres a hidden hideout in the back
f|mm more or less yeah more or less
M|yes, I'm in the same place
f|mmhmm
M|its a lot more complicated than that.
f|and eh i'm just above that bit of land in between there the curved bit of land
M|no, you just have a tree in there
f|right right i think we'll go back to the right before i come to the abandoned cottage
M|No, that's the Roman Empire.
f|mmhmm
M|left temple

M|the pine gro vewy
f|right okay oops that was
M|at the bandipede

f|no
M|i just want to go over the fallen pillar
f|mm okey-dokey
M|I'm so high right now
f|ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that
M|you know you're gonna have to make a fort with that line, right?
f|okay
M|mhm, just past antelope
f|nothing up until a poisoned stream
M|i've got it, but i'm not sure what i'm doing
f|the very end of the map
M|yeah i'll stop
f|a diagonal
M|You can't take a picture of a photo of a picture
f|right i'm right under it
M|so then i can just build a forge and get it?
f|left come out turn left then turn left again and get to the bottom then turn left again
M|i'm on my way there now
f|it's aye but it's still to my left
M|yea you have it, it's just not as flat as you think it is.
f|uh-huh
M|left turn round
