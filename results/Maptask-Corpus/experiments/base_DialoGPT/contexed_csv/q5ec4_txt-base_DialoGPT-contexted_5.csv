97,you are going through the rocket and then you are past the other side of it.,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right,uh-huh,right out to the side of the page
98,the rocket part?,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right,uh-huh
99,about a 5 min,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right
100,it is a bit hard to read,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
101,"i mean, how is that a rocket?",down the side of the page,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket
102,for a minute,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
103,"right, for about two millimetres.",right,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page,oh aye near enough
104,"yes, and then we will start to build a house",and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
105,what is this?,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page
106,I'm going to make it a rocket,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres
107,so what's the point?,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right
108,just don't go in too far,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave
109,yes i am,and go past down below the cave,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse
110,and then go down further,yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea,and go past down below the cave,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it
111,but it is in the ocean,no it's not in the sea,yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea,and go past down below the cave,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres
112,I'll make a video,okay then,no it's not in the sea,yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea,and go past down below the cave,okay
113,yes yes and yes,and i've and then where do i go after that to the old lighthouse,okay then,no it's not in the sea,yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea,and go past down below the cave
114,i don't know what to do now,just stop at the old lighthouse uh-huh,and i've and then where do i go after that to the old lighthouse,okay then,no it's not in the sea,yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea
115,"i just stopped at the new lighthouse, so i dont need to do anything",just stop at the old lighthouse okay,just stop at the old lighthouse uh-huh,and i've and then where do i go after that to the old lighthouse,okay then,no it's not in the sea
