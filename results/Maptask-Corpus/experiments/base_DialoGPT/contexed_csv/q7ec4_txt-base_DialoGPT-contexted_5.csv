78,right and east are the same,right is there a pyramid,right,ah there's no lemon grove in this one,up past the lemon grove,and then change to going due north for about three inches
79,right where we want them,mmhmm,right is there a pyramid,right,ah there's no lemon grove in this one,up past the lemon grove
80,and now you're on the other side,yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid,mmhmm,right is there a pyramid,right,ah there's no lemon grove in this one
81,so where are you going,mmhmm,yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid,mmhmm,right is there a pyramid,right
82,and back down,and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid,mmhmm,yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid,mmhmm,right is there a pyramid
83,i will walk to it,will we walk to the top of it,and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid,mmhmm,yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid,mmhmm
84,you should have walked up to the pyramid and said you're sorry,no straight across until,will we walk to the top of it,and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid,mmhmm,yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
85,and the top is a little bit higher,right,no straight across until,will we walk to the top of it,and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid,mmhmm
86,and then,on the same level,right,no straight across until,will we walk to the top of it,and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
87,I'm so high right now,okey-dokey,on the same level,right,no straight across until,will we walk to the top of it
88,theres a pyramid in the center of the map,and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid,okey-dokey,on the same level,right,no straight across until
89,You can also just use a rope and some rope,yeah,and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid,okey-dokey,on the same level,right
90,it's pretty good but the cobbled streets are not very good,right do you have a cobbled street,yeah,and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid,okey-dokey,on the same level
91,do you have the original map?,no,right do you have a cobbled street,yeah,and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid,okey-dokey
92,I know what you mean.,right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and,no,right do you have a cobbled street,yeah,and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
93,i think theres a hole there,directly below it,right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and,no,right do you have a cobbled street,yeah
94,that's where the pyramid is,ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid,directly below it,right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and,no,right do you have a cobbled street
95,yeah it's the last one,right so it'll be mmhmm,ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid,directly below it,right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and,no
96,the pyramid is not the only thing that is curved,"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid",right so it'll be mmhmm,ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid,directly below it,right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
97,but how,right,"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid",right so it'll be mmhmm,ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid,directly below it
98,You could just straighten the pyramid.,and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip,right,"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid",right so it'll be mmhmm,ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
99,right until you get to the end of the line,right,and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip,right,"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid",right so it'll be mmhmm
100,"right, so what is the best way to get the pyramid to the top?",right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south,right,and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip,right,"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid"
101,i mean you could always do it to south,right,right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south,right,and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip,right
102,I'll be on my way,to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village,right,right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south,right,and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
103,it is a problem,mmhmm,to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village,right,right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south,right
104,just to the far east,and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are,mmhmm,to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village,right,right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south
105,so just to the nearest village?,yeah,and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are,mmhmm,to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village,right
106,How far away is it from the road?,just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there,yeah,and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are,mmhmm,to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
107,about a centimeter,right,just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there,yeah,and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are,mmhmm
108,"That's not what I meant. I'm asking if you're saying that's what you mean by a circle, and not a circle.","now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote",right,just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there,yeah,and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
109,"so, you want me to do it then?",mmhmm,"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote",right,just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there,yeah
110,then curve,"and then straight across until you're below the ""e""",mmhmm,"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote",right,just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there
111,in remote,"the ""e"" in remote","and then straight across until you're below the ""e""",mmhmm,"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote",right
112,"you should have the remote, you'll get the remote","the ""e"" in village sorry","the ""e"" in remote","and then straight across until you're below the ""e""",mmhmm,"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote"
113,in remote village,"""e"" in village right","the ""e"" in village sorry","the ""e"" in remote","and then straight across until you're below the ""e""",mmhmm
114,and you can do it on a wooden board and it's a very quick and easy,and then go straight across another inch and that's the finish,"""e"" in village right","the ""e"" in village sorry","the ""e"" in remote","and then straight across until you're below the ""e"""
