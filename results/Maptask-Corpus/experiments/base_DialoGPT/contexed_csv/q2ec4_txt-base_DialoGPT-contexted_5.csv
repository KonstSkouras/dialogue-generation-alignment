0,what size diamond mine are you mining?,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down,mmhmm,do you have a diamond mine just below it,yep,right at the very top of the page there's a cross
1,can you give me a rough estimate of the distance?,right start from the cross yeah,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down,mmhmm,do you have a diamond mine just below it,yep
2,the only thing i can think of is the diamond mining part,'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a,right start from the cross yeah,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down,mmhmm,do you have a diamond mine just below it
3,i have one.,it's directly down yeah,'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a,right start from the cross yeah,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down,mmhmm
4,yeah i know i can't afford a wagon right now but i could do it in a few hours,yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine,it's directly down yeah,'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a,right start from the cross yeah,about an inch to your right draw a line straight down
5,do you have the diamond?,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel,yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine,it's directly down yeah,'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a,right start from the cross yeah
6,"yeah i've got a diamond mine, and it's in the diamond mines",what's the next thing to its right,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel,yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine,it's directly down yeah,'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a
7,I've got a wooden rock to the left,to the right i've got eventually a cactus,what's the next thing to its right,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel,yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine,it's directly down yeah
8,I have the same problem.,you don't have a rift valley,to the right i've got eventually a cactus,what's the next thing to its right,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel,yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine
9,it's a wagon wheel.,oh i've got a rift valley above that,you don't have a rift valley,to the right i've got eventually a cactus,what's the next thing to its right,mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel
10,yeah i guess youre right,yeah okay,oh i've got a rift valley above that,you don't have a rift valley,to the right i've got eventually a cactus,what's the next thing to its right
11,"i've got it, but i'm not sure what i'm doing",you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side,yeah okay,oh i've got a rift valley above that,you don't have a rift valley,to the right i've got eventually a cactus
12,i am not sure how i can get it on the top of my head,you're drawing your line down,you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side,yeah okay,oh i've got a rift valley above that,you don't have a rift valley
13,I don't know what you're talking about,mmhmm,you're drawing your line down,you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side,yeah okay,oh i've got a rift valley above that
14,What's the line?,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page,mmhmm,you're drawing your line down,you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side,yeah okay
15,under what corner?,towards the right-hand corner,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page,mmhmm,you're drawing your line down,you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side
16,i mean... do you mean on the right hand side?,yeah,towards the right-hand corner,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page,mmhmm,you're drawing your line down
17,If you go to the Cactus thing you can get it on the right hand corner,ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that,yeah,towards the right-hand corner,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page,mmhmm
18,the cactus?,right,ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that,yeah,towards the right-hand corner,underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page
19,right side of the cacti?,hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine,right,ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that,yeah,towards the right-hand corner
20,do you have a way to tell how far it is?,yeah,hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine,right,ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that,yeah
21,"yeah i know what that is, i was just curious",yeah and then straight down to an inch below it,yeah,hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine,right,ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that
22,i'll try that,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay,yeah and then straight down to an inch below it,yeah,hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine,right
23,"they arent really, you should probably be ok",yeah,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay,yeah and then straight down to an inch below it,yeah,hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine
24,"yeah, yeah, yeah.",and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right,yeah,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay,yeah and then straight down to an inch below it,yeah
25,ok then go left and go right,okay to right to the edge of the page,and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right,yeah,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay,yeah and then straight down to an inch below it
26,yes to the left of the center of the screen,no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page,okay to right to the edge of the page,and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right,yeah,should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay
27,go right to page,er right okay that takes me to,no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page,okay to right to the edge of the page,and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right,yeah
28,"ok, how far do i need to go?",then go up to almost the very top of the page,er right okay that takes me to,no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page,okay to right to the edge of the page,and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right
29,okays i will go to page 3 and then page 4,okay,then go up to almost the very top of the page,er right okay that takes me to,no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page,okay to right to the edge of the page
30,right now,right and then to your right again,okay,then go up to almost the very top of the page,er right okay that takes me to,no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page
31,ok now the page is back up,okay hang on,right and then to your right again,okay,then go up to almost the very top of the page,er right okay that takes me to
32,yes and then,well but,okay hang on,right and then to your right again,okay,then go up to almost the very top of the page
33,i can do that,have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner,well but,okay hang on,right and then to your right again,okay
34,the rift valley is the rift river,yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon,have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner,well but,okay hang on,right and then to your right again
35,have u ever gotten through the rifts?,yeah,yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon,have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner,well but,okay hang on
36,yeah i think so,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley,yeah,yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon,have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner,well but
37,okay so you're not going to get past the rift?,right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley,yeah,yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon,have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner
38,,"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean",right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley,yeah,yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon
39,You're not getting past me,right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up,"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean",right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley,yeah
40,so you know,yeah below and then like into the rift valley,right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up,"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean",right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah,you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley
41,I'm going to the bottom,okay right,yeah below and then like into the rift valley,right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up,"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean",right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah
42,"ok, I'll try that",and right through,okay right,yeah below and then like into the rift valley,right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up,"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean"
43,"ok just so you know, you're right",i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page,and right through,okay right,yeah below and then like into the rift valley,right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up
44,i dont think so,straight through yeah,i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page,and right through,okay right,yeah below and then like into the rift valley
45,i think i should have done it straight up but it's up to you,alright there we go,straight through yeah,i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page,and right through,okay right
46,"i have a compass in the middle of the river, so i can see where i am going",and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean,alright there we go,straight through yeah,i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page,and right through
47,that's what i said,not quite,and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean,alright there we go,straight through yeah,i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page
48,"I'm in the rift, so I'll just say I'm not in the rifts.",right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right,not quite,and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean,alright there we go,straight through yeah
49,you got me there,was i,right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right,not quite,and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean,alright there we go
50,what? i'm confused.,yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint,was i,right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right,not quite,and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean
51,it's in the rift valleys,right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so,yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint,was i,right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right,not quite
52,i don't know where i'm going from here,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah",right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so,yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint,was i,right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right
53,i have a rift valley,yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah",right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so,yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint,was i
54,"that's the rift river valley, right?",yeah,yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah",right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so,yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint
55,"I was supposed, I'm in the middle of the rift valley",right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it,yeah,yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah",right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so
56,its in the rift valley,yes,right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it,yeah,yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page,"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah"
57,its a little more complicated than that,well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it,yes,right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it,yeah,yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page
58,i just hit the bottom of the rift valley,yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks,well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it,yes,right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it,yeah
59,yeah i do,yeah,yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks,well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it,yes,right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it
60,I can try to get a pic of it,and do you have a stone creek,yeah,yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks,well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it,yes
61,so do you want to trade?,erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks,and do you have a stone creek,yeah,yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks,well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it
62,yeah i got the stones,uh-huh,erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks,and do you have a stone creek,yeah,yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks
63,Uhh... and again a few inches below the water,and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout,uh-huh,erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks,and do you have a stone creek,yeah
64,if you don't mind i'll trade you my fenrir for a stone mountain,yeah i've got that,and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout,uh-huh,erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks,and do you have a stone creek
65,you're right. i'll have to do that,but i haven't got anything else round about that area,yeah i've got that,and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout,uh-huh,erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks
66,what's that,you've got nothing to like the left of it,but i haven't got anything else round about that area,yeah i've got that,and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout,uh-huh
67,i've got a bit of dirt around the top of the rock and it's not quite as nice as that,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks,you've got nothing to like the left of it,but i haven't got anything else round about that area,yeah i've got that,and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout
68,okay i'll try and find it,well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks,you've got nothing to like the left of it,but i haven't got anything else round about that area,yeah i've got that
69,is that where the rapids are?,through the centre of the two rocks,well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks,you've got nothing to like the left of it,but i haven't got anything else round about that area
70,theres a rock in between two rocks?,no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch,through the centre of the two rocks,well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks,you've got nothing to like the left of it
71,we're on the top of the hill,right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state,no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch,through the centre of the two rocks,well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks,er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks
72,I'm going to take the time to look up the name of the lake,do you have white water,right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state,no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch,through the centre of the two rocks,well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks
73,okay cool I'll try to get some of the other stuff done,er well that'll be the rapids,do you have white water,right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state,no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch,through the centre of the two rocks
74,i don't know if you have a rock creek above the white water but it's not a rock,yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water,er well that'll be the rapids,do you have white water,right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state,no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch
75,okay ok do you have a white water above your rock creek?,no i've got,yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water,er well that'll be the rapids,do you have white water,right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state
76,you've got a lake above your rock,or a swamp to its left,no i've got,yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water,er well that'll be the rapids,do you have white water
77,I'll take the white water.,i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine,or a swamp to its left,no i've got,yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water,er well that'll be the rapids
78,you mean to the right?,to its left well that's a a stone ss,i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine,or a swamp to its left,no i've got,yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water
79,the best part is the water,but you know right right back at the start,to its left well that's a a stone ss,i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine,or a swamp to its left,no i've got
80,no you dont,oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek,but you know right right back at the start,to its left well that's a a stone ss,i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine,or a swamp to its left
81,you mean to the rapian's right?,nope,oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek,but you know right right back at the start,to its left well that's a a stone ss,i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine
82,i'll take it back,no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like,nope,oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek,but you know right right back at the start,to its left well that's a a stone ss
83,it's the opposite,am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks,no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like,nope,oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek,but you know right right back at the start
84,where are you going?,above,am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks,no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like,nope,oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek
85,at the moment im just to the right of the rock,so where's where do i go from there,above,am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks,no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like,nope
86,just the way it looks.,right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids,so where's where do i go from there,above,am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks,no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like
87,what are you doing?,taking it round from the top or,right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids,so where's where do i go from there,above,am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks
88,I don't know where to go but I'm going to the top,from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek,taking it round from the top or,right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids,so where's where do i go from there,above
89,"theres a few of them, and the one with the giant white thing on the ground",right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids,from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek,taking it round from the top or,right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids,so where's where do i go from there
90,right ok so i am at the bottom right corner of rapids and you are at the left,right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like,right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids,from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek,taking it round from the top or,right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids
91,"i think you mean that they will come to the rapades, but stay there for a while",oh i see what you mean yeah,right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like,right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids,from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek,taking it round from the top or
92,how do you go from the top right to the bottom left?,in like length further down from that on the page,oh i see what you mean yeah,right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like,right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids,from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek
93,i mean you can just walk up to the rapid and take it and go up to their encampment,have you got a manned fort below the rapids,in like length further down from that on the page,oh i see what you mean yeah,right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like,right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids
94,Do you have an outlaws'hideout?,no,have you got a manned fort below the rapids,in like length further down from that on the page,oh i see what you mean yeah,right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like
95,"you know you're gonna have to make a fort with that line, right?",'cause i've got that interrupting er like almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned fort,no,have you got a manned fort below the rapids,in like length further down from that on the page,oh i see what you mean yeah
