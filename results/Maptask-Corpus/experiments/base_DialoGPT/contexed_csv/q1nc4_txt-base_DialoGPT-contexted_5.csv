29,I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for here.,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start,right
30,i don't know how you'd get that from the picture.,yeah a single old pine,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start

34,there's a way,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh,yeah a single old pine
35,I think you need to start with the first word.,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh
36,i go up to the forge,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay
37,you go up to the forge,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right
38,under the forge,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start
39,i go right and left as far away as i can,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh
40,I go right up,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
41,yes but you wouldnt be able to see what it is,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine
42,so... how far can I go?,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine
43,"i mean if you go to the forge, you don t have to go back",oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine
44,not really,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less
45,I think i'll just go with the pine,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean
46,I have a torch and a torch.,route but eh,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to

48,I don't know how to do that.,right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest,right up,route but eh,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact
49,do you have a drill?,uh-huh,right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest,right up,route but eh,okay i don't have a forge anyway
50,huh? how do i do that?,you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest,uh-huh,right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest,right up,route but eh
51,so you're a tree?,am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay,you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest,uh-huh,right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest,right up
52,and a pine tree,you've got a bay there,am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay,you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest,uh-huh,right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest
53,well I guess you are now,uh-huh,you've got a bay there,am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay,you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest,uh-huh
54,i dont have a tree there,i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top,uh-huh,you've got a bay there,am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay,you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
55,u r u i'm i r i,uh-huh,i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top,uh-huh,you've got a bay there,am i and am i going straight kind of along the outline of the bay
56,uhhhhhhhhhhh,have you got a bay at the bottom,uh-huh,i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top,uh-huh,you've got a bay there
57,i think i have a good idea,yeah,have you got a bay at the bottom,uh-huh,i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top,uh-huh
58,which one is it?,crane bay,yeah,have you got a bay at the bottom,uh-huh,i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top

62,theres a way to get the screenshot up,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top,uh-huh,crane bay
63,How far down?,erm about an inch and a half,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top,uh-huh
64,goin for the bay,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest,erm about an inch and a half,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top
65,i dont know how i can prove it. i just say,uh-huh okay,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest,erm about an inch and a half,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top
66,that's the bay.,okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine,uh-huh okay,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest,erm about an inch and a half,how far down
67,"i think he means the bay, where the",mmhmm,okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine,uh-huh okay,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest,erm about an inch and a half
68,h,okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields,mmhmm,okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine,uh-huh okay,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest
69,i am not going to lie i think i might have made a mistake,no,okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields,mmhmm,okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine,uh-huh okay
70,what if I just go to the bottom right?,on your map no well the,no,okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields,mmhmm,okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
71,yea uh,oh yeah uh-huh,on your map no well the,no,okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields,mmhmm
