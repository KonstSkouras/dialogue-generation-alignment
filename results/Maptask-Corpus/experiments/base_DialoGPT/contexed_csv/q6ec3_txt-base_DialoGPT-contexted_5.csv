73,i just want to go over the fallen pillar,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move
74,i think i just have to do the same thing,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page
75,no i don't want to,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine
76,ok i'll try that,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
77,that's a good point,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars
