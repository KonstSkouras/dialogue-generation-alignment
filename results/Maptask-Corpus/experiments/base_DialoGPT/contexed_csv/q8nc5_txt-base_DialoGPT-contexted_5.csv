1,and the left,to the right,right okay ehm right you're going to start coming down but but as you come down you're you curve to the right,yeah,to the left of the burnt forest,uh-huh
2,how do you get to the burnt tree?,uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest,to the right,right okay ehm right you're going to start coming down but but as you come down you're you curve to the right,yeah,to the left of the burnt forest
3,left to the left,right how far,uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest,to the right,right okay ehm right you're going to start coming down but but as you come down you're you curve to the right,yeah
4,right i can see it,right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start,right how far,uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest,to the right,right okay ehm right you're going to start coming down but but as you come down you're you curve to the right
5,how far away do you wanna go?,uh-huh,right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start,right how far,uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest,to the right
6,"understood, what is it going to?",understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve,uh-huh,right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start,right how far,uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest
7,I have,have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage,understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve,uh-huh,right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start,right how far
8,have they gone to the wrong end?,no,have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage,understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve,uh-huh,right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
9,you can't curve the tree in the way you curve it,how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve,no,have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage,understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve,uh-huh
10,is this a joke,no you just see how,how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve,no,have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage,understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
11,how do you go about it?,i just go past it,no you just see how,how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve,no,have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage
12,i think you just got the joke,uh-huh you just,i just go past it,no you just see how,how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve,no
13,its just a small radius,so it's only a slight curve,uh-huh you just,i just go past it,no you just see how,how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve
14,huh u just,uh-huh it's just a slight curve,so it's only a slight curve,uh-huh you just,i just go past it,no you just see how
15,uhhh and then backwards,to the right and then back to the left,uh-huh it's just a slight curve,so it's only a slight curve,uh-huh you just,i just go past it
16,"um, and then the right",uh-huh and then back to the left,to the right and then back to the left,uh-huh it's just a slight curve,so it's only a slight curve,uh-huh you just
17,right uhh,right uh-huh,uh-huh and then back to the left,to the right and then back to the left,uh-huh it's just a slight curve,so it's only a slight curve
18,yeah i think so,okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath,right uh-huh,uh-huh and then back to the left,to the right and then back to the left,uh-huh it's just a slight curve
19,ummm and then right,mm mmhmm,okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath,right uh-huh,uh-huh and then back to the left,to the right and then back to the left
20,no its just a regular ravine that i built,right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine,mm mmhmm,okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath,right uh-huh,uh-huh and then back to the left
21,"Oh okay, I'll try that.",uh-huh,right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine,mm mmhmm,okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath,right uh-huh
22,"right, that's the way it is",right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine,uh-huh,right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine,mm mmhmm,okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath
23,like this?,below it,right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine,uh-huh,right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine,mm mmhmm
24,right go go,uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine,below it,right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine,uh-huh,right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
25,the ravine is a bit higher up than the ravines,right so i go along to the right,uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine,below it,right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine,uh-huh
26,right go ahead,mmhmm,right so i go along to the right,uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine,below it,right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
27,"i think the ravines are supposed to be on the right, so you're in the raven",until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it,mmhmm,right so i go along to the right,uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine,below it
28,uhuh uh uh,uh-huh uh-huh,until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it,mmhmm,right so i go along to the right,uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine
29,what? i dont know what you mean,and then i go up past the left-hand side of it,uh-huh uh-huh,until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it,mmhmm,right so i go along to the right
30,uhh what?,uh-huh right do you have the remote village,and then i go up past the left-hand side of it,uh-huh uh-huh,until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it,mmhmm
31,you got to the end of the ravines,no,uh-huh right do you have the remote village,and then i go up past the left-hand side of it,uh-huh uh-huh,until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it
32,right i don't care,right well it doesn't doesn't matter,no,uh-huh right do you have the remote village,and then i go up past the left-hand side of it,uh-huh uh-huh
33,okay i'm back,i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine,right well it doesn't doesn't matter,no,uh-huh right do you have the remote village,and then i go up past the left-hand side of it
34,"i have to go now, but i'll be back later",uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then,i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine,right well it doesn't doesn't matter,no,uh-huh right do you have the remote village
35,still can't go above it,still to the left of it,uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then,i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine,right well it doesn't doesn't matter,no
36,umm how are you now?,uh-huh uh-huh,still to the left of it,uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then,i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine,right well it doesn't doesn't matter
37,"i can't go the bottom right, you can't see the back of it.",uh-huh,uh-huh uh-huh,still to the left of it,uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then,i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine
38,uhhuh but then you have to go in a circle,and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line,uh-huh,uh-huh uh-huh,still to the left of it,uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then
39,the pine gro vewy,have you got the pine grove,and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line,uh-huh,uh-huh uh-huh,still to the left of it
40,huhuh uh,uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove,have you got the pine grove,and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line,uh-huh,uh-huh uh-huh
41,i'll go as close as i can to the pines grove.,mmhmm,uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove,have you got the pine grove,and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line,uh-huh
42,and then i'm going to the bottom of the tree,right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up,mmhmm,uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove,have you got the pine grove,and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
43,"I'm pretty sure it's level 1, but I could be wrong",right,right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up,mmhmm,uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove,have you got the pine grove
44,yes and i'm not near the pinegrove,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet,right,right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up,mmhmm,uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove
45,ok i'll get on in a sec,okay,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet,right,right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up,mmhmm
46,I'm not sure.,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right,okay,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet,right,right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
47,i have to stop for a while so i will be back,okay mmhmm,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right,okay,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet,right
48,I don't think you know what a line is,see what i mean,okay mmhmm,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right,okay,but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
49,i dont think so,uh-huh,see what i mean,okay mmhmm,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right,okay
50,I don't understand what you mean,so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove,uh-huh,see what i mean,okay mmhmm,so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right
51,top left corner,bottom left-hand corner,so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove,uh-huh,see what i mean,okay mmhmm
52,I'm guessing you are in the bottom right corner?,mmhmm,bottom left-hand corner,so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove,uh-huh,see what i mean
53,"i go down, up, down, right, left, left...",but not ehm touching it or,mmhmm,bottom left-hand corner,so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove,uh-huh
54,yes touching,no not touching,but not ehm touching it or,mmhmm,bottom left-hand corner,so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
