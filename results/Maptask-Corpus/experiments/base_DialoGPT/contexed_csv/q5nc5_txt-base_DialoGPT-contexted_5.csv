50,what do you mean?,well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there,aye,you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom,mmhmm now where which way am i heading down,okay and then just like a nice big curve heading down about six inches
51,in the bottom of the water,from the top,well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there,aye,you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom,mmhmm now where which way am i heading down
52,You don't need to go any further,two inches above it,from the top,well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there,aye,you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom
53,the right side of the page is the one with the black stripes.,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it,two inches above it,from the top,well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there,aye
54,so... how far?,yeah,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it,two inches above it,from the top,well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there
55,the left,right,yeah,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it,two inches above it,from the top
56,"right,",sort of curving round now see stone creek,right,yeah,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it,two inches above it
57,is this the same one?,yeah,sort of curving round now see stone creek,right,yeah,and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it
58,"it's not a flat rock, it's a flat lake",right you're just heading along past that you see the flat rocks,yeah,sort of curving round now see stone creek,right,yeah
59,i'll help you out,no,right you're just heading along past that you see the flat rocks,yeah,sort of curving round now see stone creek,right
