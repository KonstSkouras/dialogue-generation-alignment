M:	what size diamond mine are you mining?
g:	'til it's 'til it's an inch below the diamond mine right do you have a
M:	the only thing i can think of is the diamond mining part
g:	yeah do you have a a wagon wheel just to the right of the the diamond mine
M:	yeah i know i can't afford a wagon right now but i could do it in a few hours
g:	what's the next thing to its right
M:	yeah i've got a diamond mine and it's in the diamond mines
g:	you don't have a rift valley
M:	i have the same problem.
g:	yeah okay
M:	yeah i guess youre right
g:	you're drawing your line down
M:	i am not sure how i can get it on the top of my head
g:	underneath draw a line to your right and straight along at a slight angle rising up towards the back of the corner of the page
M:	what's the line?
g:	yeah
M:	i mean... do you mean on the right hand side?
g:	right
M:	the cactus?
g:	yeah
M:	do you have a way to tell how far it is?
g:	should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay
M:	i'll try that
g:	and then go straight along to my right which is your right as well go straight along to the right
M:	yeah yeah yeah.
g:	no to about halfway to page about four inches off before the page
M:	yes to the left of the center of the screen
g:	then go up to almost the very top of the page
M:	ok how far do i need to go?
g:	right and then to your right again
M:	right now
g:	well but
M:	yes and then
g:	yeah you're going to actually go through the rift valley like the rift valley's like a half moon
M:	the rift valley is the rift river
g:	you're going to go and you're going to come right through you're going to like intersect right almost at the midpoint of the rift valley
M:	yeah i think so
g:	"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean"
M:	
g:	yeah below and then like into the rift valley
M:	so you know
g:	and right through
M:	ok i'll try that
g:	straight through yeah
M:	i dont think so
g:	and you want to go to the sort of midpoint of the rift valley you want to intersect in the midpoint of the rift valley going down the way do you know what i mean
M:	i have a compass in the middle of the river so i can see where i am going
g:	right you've got in you're above the rift valley first of all right
M:	i'm in the rift so i'll just say i'm not in the rifts.
g:	yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint
M:	what? i'm confused.
g:	"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah"
M:	i don't know where i'm going from here
g:	yeah
M:	that's the rift river valley right?
g:	yes
M:	its in the rift valley
g:	yeah through the midpoint below your rift valley about four inches down do you have rocks
M:	i just hit the bottom of the rift valley
g:	and do you have a stone creek
M:	i can try to get a pic of it
g:	uh-huh
M:	yeah i got the stones
g:	yeah i've got that
M:	if you don't mind i'll trade you my fenrir for a stone mountain
g:	you've got nothing to like the left of it
M:	what's that
g:	well i've got a stone creek there see in between you want to go from the rift valley right down in between the rocks
M:	okay i'll try and find it
g:	no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch
M:	theres a rock in between two rocks?
g:	do you have white water
M:	i'm going to take the time to look up the name of the lake
g:	yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water
M:	i don't know if you have a rock creek above the white water but it's not a rock
g:	or a swamp to its left
M:	you've got a lake above your rock
g:	to its left well that's a a stone ss
M:	you mean to the right?
g:	oh no aye yeah you don't have like above the the rapids to its slightly to its right you don't have a stone creek
M:	no you dont
g:	no well take your line right down to your rapids which is my white water and just like
M:	i'll take it back
g:	above
M:	where are you going?
g:	right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids
M:	just the way it looks.
g:	from the top but stay quite close 'cause you don't otherwise you're going to be in that stone creek
M:	i don't know where to go but i'm going to the top
g:	right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like
M:	right ok so i am at the bottom right corner of rapids and you are at the left
g:	in like length further down from that on the page
M:	how do you go from the top right to the bottom left?
g:	no
M:	do you have an outlaws'hideout?
g:	you got another stone creek
M:	how do you get that?
g:	and stone slabs
M:	and the other stone
g:	no well yeah slightly to its right there's some stone slabs
M:	no stone creek?
g:	no how far down's the manned fort
M:	right where the right of the well is
g:	take it further down go right under the manned go under your manned fort and between your stone creek
M:	how far down is it?
g:	no go go down under your manned fort and then
M:	you can see the stone walls
g:	go round the left-hand side
M:	which direction do you wanna go?
g:	and then when you get to the when you get below it go up towards your outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page
M:	you can't go up there
g:	yeah
M:	right side?
g:	right below your outlaws' hideout a good bit below do you have a noose

M:	you would be surprised how many people think the world is a flat
g:	aye right okay so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing
M:	no it's not
g:	right above the noose
M:	how do you know
g:	okay from where that line is that you've drawn go straight down 'til you pass the noose and you're passing the noose like on its right-hand side by a wee bit
M:	you can't see it but it's pretty much right above the line
g:	if you know what i mean yeah
M:	i know what you mean
g:	mmhmm
