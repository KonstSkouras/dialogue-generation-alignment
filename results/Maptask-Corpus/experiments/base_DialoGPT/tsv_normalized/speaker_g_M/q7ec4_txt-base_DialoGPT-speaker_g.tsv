M:	what about the start of the hill?
g:	go along to the the left
M:	i'm at the start of the mountain
g:	there's no banana tree in this one
M:	the banana tree is there
g:	uh-huh well say the top's north and
M:	the top is north
g:	go west
M:	i can't
g:	until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
M:	go north
g:	"and then come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and a level with the ""c"" and maybe about an inch to west of the ""c"""
M:	that's a lot of up and down
g:	right and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper
M:	then go east and up the slope
g:	now do you have a footbridge
M:	i have a bridge
g:	right go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge
M:	right i am going up north, i am just going up the tree
g:	and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge
M:	start at the foot bridge
g:	right and then the path the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge now do you have a poisoned stream there
M:	yes sir
g:	well just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half
M:	i think it's just the foot bridge
g:	uh-huh and then och take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
M:	it's fine. i just don't like to be caught in the middle of a river when i'm on the foot bridge
g:	and then do you have an old temple
M:	and just like that, you're in
g:	right go along eastward for about two inches
M:	and do you want to go to the eastward
g:	and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old temple
M:	right then go along westward for a few inches
g:	mmhmm now go up about two and a half inches do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there
M:	yes, yes i do
g:	right what about do you have an abandoned truck
M:	i have a car.
g:	uh-huh
M:	okay where are you?
g:	is there anything between the old temple and the truck
M:	the old temple is the abandoned one.
g:	right i don't have that
M:	i think it's a slate mountain, but i'm not 100
g:	go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it
M:	what is the stone?
g:	and then and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees
M:	and start and stop and start and start again
g:	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the
M:	go one and a quarter and you'll have it
g:	something uh-huh
M:	huh what?
g:	and then back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to your abandoned truck just below it
M:	so then the truck goes down the hill to the truck, then back up
g:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
M:	right and then go backwards to the back of the truck
g:	"until you're just below the ""a"""
M:	then it's a truck
g:	now have you got baboons
M:	i'm a baby.
g:	right now come due south
M:	now come south
g:	about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters
M:	about tree fiddy
g:	and then due west for about two inches uh then
M:	okay, just tell me when you're ready
g:	do you have a white mountain further up
M:	about two inches
g:	"right now well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the ""a"" and the come up to make that a ""u"" shape"
M:	huh, uh
g:	and then draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain
M:	you're welcome
g:	right now mm go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
M:	right then
g:	and then change to going due north for about three inches
M:	move north
g:	ah there's no lemon grove in this one
M:	and you have to go north for a mile to the north
g:	right is there a pyramid
M:	right and east are the same
g:	yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
M:	and now you're on the other side
g:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
M:	and back down
g:	no straight across until
M:	you should have walked up to the pyramid and said you're sorry
g:	on the same level
M:	and then
g:	and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
M:	theres a pyramid in the center of the map
g:	right do you have a cobbled street
M:	it's pretty good but the cobbled streets are not very good
g:	right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
M:	i know what you mean.
g:	ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
M:	that's where the pyramid is
g:	"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid"
M:	the pyramid is not the only thing that is curved
g:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
M:	you could just straighten the pyramid.
g:	right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south
M:	right, so what is the best way to get the pyramid to the top?
g:	to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
M:	i'll be on my way
g:	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
M:	just to the far east
g:	just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there
M:	how far away is it from the road?
g:	"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote"
M:	that's not what i meant. i'm asking if you're saying that's what you mean by a circle, and not a circle.
g:	"and then straight across until you're below the ""e"""
M:	then curve
g:	"the ""e"" in village sorry"
M:	you should have the remote, you'll get the remote
g:	and then go straight across another inch and that's the finish
M:	and you can do it on a wooden board and it's a very quick and easy
