M:	okay, i'll just go in there and check
g:	right take that same line still down vertically to the left of the ravine
M:	no i mean like a little bit down
g:	well just draw round it
M:	i think you can't go around the ravines on the ravins
g:	uh-huh is the cottage in the way there no
M:	it's a ravine.
g:	well that's okay right now take that take the line is the cottage directly beside the ravine
M:	i dont know how to take a picture of a ravine, it was the ravines fault
g:	is there a space between them yeah
M:	oh so you're in the ravines right now?
g:	right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage can you do that
M:	i'm in the ravines, just walk around and you'll find me
g:	yeah but i want you to draw up through between the cottage and the ravine
M:	i think you're the one that needs to draw that
g:	no up through go go down vertically until you're and draw underneath the cottage and then come up
M:	i think it's more to do with the angle of the picture
g:	between the cottage and the ravine
M:	where do you live?
g:	you weren't meant to
M:	i was told it was supposed to be a pond
g:	okay right you went down past burnt forest
M:	i did
g:	well you weren't meant to
M:	i was not
g:	okay right you're meant to come down from the start
M:	i was meant to draw round, but i went up
g:	vertically right past burnt forest
M:	turns around and stands up you were supposed to come
g:	keep drawing vertically
M:	vertical towards burnt forest and back
g:	past the cottage
M:	right past burnt mountain
g:	then go right underneath the cottage
M:	then turn right
g:	go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get to stop just above the ravine
M:	go down through the ravines
g:	and do you have a remote village
M:	go to the cottage then
g:	well on my map to the right of burnt cottage there's a remote village okay
M:	i can't find any.
g:	uh-huh and that's just situated above the ravine
M:	yes, where is it?
g:	okay so i want you to imagine i want you to imagine that the remote village is there just to the right of the burnt forest right so it's kind of like in a triangle
M:	i want you not to imagine
g:	so draw your line to the right horizontally above the ravine okay then do you have a pine forest
M:	i don't have a tree on the map
g:	a pine grove uh-huh
M:	a forest
g:	i want you to draw the line keep going to your right okay so you're sort of like drawing towards the top of the pine grove then stop and go from left to right in a diagonal underneath the pine grove
M:	okay but i want you draw your lines
g:	from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove
M:	what's the story here?
g:	uh-huh okay and then do you have anything underneath pine grove
M:	i want to say i did but i don't. i want to see if anyone can confirm.
g:	mm is that just right beneath it
M:	the air vent is the air vent
g:	do you have concealed hideout
M:	i think i have a small hideout for you to hang in the cove
g:	okay right i that's fine right i want you to go draw to your to your right under the pine grove avoiding the avalanche
M:	i was going to do that, but i didn't want to get caught in the avalanche and have to go to my to my right
g:	uh-huh
M:	that's not where i want to go
g:	can you go between the pine grove and the avalanche
M:	okay i can do that
g:	to get past it yeah well draw that way
M:	huhuh i wanna draw it
g:	not not completely down just get past the avalanche right
M:	get to the hidden hideout and you'll be fine
g:	and then ehm eventually i want you to go round concealed hideout
M:	yes i can
g:	okay
M:	im not sure
g:	to to the right of concealed hideout
M:	i dont see anything
g:	uh-huh and i want you to draw underneath concealed hideout stop just underneath concealed bit there okay are you there
M:	okay im in the middle of a drawing
g:	right do you have a boat house to your left
M:	yea i am, i can get on now
g:	oh do you not have another one to your right of the concealed hideout
M:	i have one
g:	draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be
M:	i'm going to make you a camper
g:	uh-huh
M:	oh yeah
g:	yeah i don't want you to go near the river at all
M:	i can't see the river. i want to see it.
g:	no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left
M:	i want you in the boat
g:	thought you did
M:	yes i do
g:	well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout
M:	i think you need to add one more letter
g:	uh-huh
M:	the other side
g:	have you drawn down to there
M:	yea i got it
g:	good right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout right do you see where in can you see crane bay
M:	yeah i know
g:	do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point
M:	what do you mean?
g:	just underneath concealed hideout
M:	i thought you said you were in canada?
g:	or just to the right of it okay i want you to you see where it comes down like that
M:	how do you see it?
g:	well i want you to follow follow the line of the the coast there so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there
M:	i'm pretty sure it's just under concealment.
g:	right do you have ehm coconut palm to your left
M:	you need to draw a line between
g:	no do you have pebbled shore
M:	i don't think so
g:	well i want you to draw uh i've got pebbled shore and above that i've got coconut palm
M:	i am not sure if i am, but i would like to draw you a picture of a coconut palm.
g:	right so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no right have you got anything below pebbled shore
M:	gasp
g:	well
M:	not a problem i just have to draw a tree
g:	right see see where the flagship is
M:	the line of the tree and the line of a ship.
g:	right and see where the pebbled shore is
M:	right look where the bay is
g:	imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you
M:	yes you can
g:	sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there
M:	im sure it will be a great finish but i just want to know if i can finish the final one
g:	it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page
M:	i want to see the map
g:	yeah uh-huh
M:	so, where is it?
g:	no no not to the right
M:	i don't know how to do that but i'm not sure how to make it work
g:	no
M:	it's a bug
g:	the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore
M:	what side of the map?
g:	well just draw in a diagonal to your left
M:	i am not good at drawing.
g:	mmhmm right quite far down
M:	you're right, i should draw the right way down
g:	and then
M:	then then
g:	well i want you to avoid that
M:	i want to avoid the downvotes
g:	and go uh-huh no well i don't know where's your where's your washed stones
M:	oh, you're right.
g:	well that's okay just draw round it and past it
M:	its right below the beach
g:	yeah
M:	but the line is just too far to the right
g:	and then the finish is just ehm on a horizontal with the flagship near to the coast about a centimetre away from the coast
M:	you can just go to the bottom and you can do the final finish
g:	mmhmm
M:	you should have waited for the last minute, you could have had a chance to get the achievement
g:	okay
M:	i'll be there
g:	is that just beside the flagship yeah
M:	there is one in the bottom right corner
g:	okay
M:	just wait till i get back
