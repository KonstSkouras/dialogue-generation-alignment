M:	i dont get it
g:	roughly up a bit huh
M:	i'm guessing they're all around the corner from me
g:	of the map
M:	of the camp
g:	right okay so if you just go left from the missionary camp a bit and then down
M:	i'm not sure how to get it, but it's on the map.
g:	yeah to about a couple of centimetres above the top of the bottom of the page
M:	i don't get it
g:	and then continue straight left along until about four centimetres from the end and then go straight up again
M:	i mean i'm going to try it right now
g:	sorry
M:	i don't see what you mean
g:	yeah probably yeah
M:	yes, but if you're on the right, you'll end up right on the far left
g:	uh do you have a rope bridge
M:	ok i have the redwood tree and the red wood bridge
g:	yeah
M:	ok, do you know how to build a rope?
g:	uh-huh yeah
M:	uhh where do you go?
g:	right
M:	right side of course
g:	mmhmm
M:	i see
g:	okay that's fine now you've got the rope bridge
M:	i'm not going to say anything
g:	so that you want to come up the page and then just when you're about in line with the rope rope bridge just turn right so you're across it
M:	i'll do that and then i'll get back to you
g:	yeah
M:	ok, how about the rope?
g:	okay if you now come down a couple of centimetres
M:	ok i'll try to be there
g:	and do you have a waterfall
M:	i have a fire
g:	yeah if you just mm do you have a sort of the water coming down
M:	okay im at the plaza
g:	if you sort of head along
M:	okay i'm heading there now
g:	so that you're about in line with the bottom of the water
M:	i have a little bit of water coming up the side of the lake.
g:	if you know what i mean
M:	ohh... well...
g:	and then have you got lost steps
M:	and then have you been lost in the water?
g:	okay if you just get to the waterfall first and then you want to go straight up to where these lost steps are
M:	i am in the waterfall and i am going straight up
g:	well have you got fallen pillars
M:	i have fallen pillars, which are lost steps?
g:	it's it's in the finishing point
M:	i dont know how to do this
g:	no ehm it's about in line with the fallen pillars
M:	i think it's on the final point
g:	to the right of them
M:	there is no end
g:	in between the rope bridge and the waterfall
M:	where exactly?
g:	uh-huh well you want to go straight up
M:	i don't want to be stuck in a cliff
g:	and you've got the lost steps
M:	and the fallen steps
g:	if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars
M:	theres a little waterfall going up from a bit of the top right corner
g:	but don't actually go near them
M:	but you can go up to the fallen pillar
g:	and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left
M:	i'm in the waterfall
g:	you'll miss the lost steps
M:	i have a feeling you're going to have a hard time finding a parking spot
g:	um to about just before the middle of the page
M:	where is the little blue circle at the bottom right?
g:	and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
M:	the one in the middle is the last step
g:	right just keep going 'til the end
M:	i think i just have to do the same thing
g:	of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres
M:	ok i'll try that
g:	do you have an obstacle there
M:	not anymore
g:	well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve
M:	i have it but i dont know how to get it
g:	and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page
M:	try clicking on the bottom of the map
g:	then do you have ancient ruins
M:	i have a lot of them
g:	yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left
M:	up and to left
g:	well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit
M:	you're not helping me with this.
g:	without actually coming into contact with them
M:	you could just use a portal to the ancient ruin
g:	a straight line
M:	i'm just gonna say that this is a nice thing to do
g:	yeah
M:	so you wanna help me out?
g:	yeah now do you have stones in the top left
M:	i can't get them to work
g:	no no it's okay now if you just uh at the top there's some stones and that's about four centimetres from the top
M:	okay then, i'll try to find it
g:	yeah
M:	yeah, just like that
g:	to about four centimetres
M:	he's not moving at all
g:	and then you want to go sharp right
M:	i'm trying to get to the point where i want to hit a guy right in the face
g:	to about halfway across the page
M:	and you want me to go fast
g:	now do you have a white mountain
M:	ok now do you want me to teach you how to ride a mountain
g:	you want to just go over the top of that and round
M:	i'm sure it's not, but i'm sure you could tell from the way it's shaped.
g:	mmhmm
M:	so go over that and go over it again
g:	yeah okay um do you have a soft furnishings store
M:	ok umm i think i have to go buy a new one
g:	eh right um you're quite close to the mountain at the moment on its right-hand side
M:	i'll be there in a minute
g:	well if you under directly underneath the mountain about three centimetres down there's a soft furnishings store
M:	i live on the mountain
g:	so you want to come down from the mountain and turn sharp left
M:	yes i am
g:	so that you're sort of in line with the left-hand side of the mountain
M:	i'm a little confused.
g:	then you come straight down and right
M:	but what if you turn right?
g:	do you have gazelles
M:	you come straight up and down
g:	underneath them
M:	so what you're saying is that the ones that go under the top are the best?
g:	the right-hand side
M:	how do you get gazelle?
g:	to about the right-hand side of the mountain level if you know what i mean
M:	to the right of the top gazelle
g:	okay that's it
M:	the mountain
g:	yeah
M:	i think you're going too far
g:	that's right
M:	i have a new weapon
