M:	yeah i'm pretty sure i have a few of those in my inventory
g:	you don't have a forge well the forge is eh below the the cliffs say about two inches down okay so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve
M:	turn around
g:	to the bottom of the cliffs
M:	where is it?
g:	and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and and down about you know two and a half inches three inches
M:	i don't know how to get to the bottom
g:	an inch and a half if you draw that line down you'll be on the left-hand side of the forge you don't have a forge but there is one there
M:	what if you're on the right hand side?
g:	so now you're about
M:	it's not really a problem if you're a right handed man
g:	you should really end up about four inches down from the the cross er you know in the same line like just beneath it in fact four inches down okay
M:	i'm not sure how you can tell the length of a cross
g:	no no
M:	you know
g:	no the initial line from the cross
M:	no it's a long way to the right
g:	goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs
M:	i'm confused
g:	it goes down to where it says cliffs okay
M:	i'm confused, the first line from a cross, the second line from an enemy
g:	about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're
M:	i don't get it
g:	yeah
M:	right, right straight down the start then you're in the bottom of the start?
g:	until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start
M:	left straight up?
g:	do you have an old pine
M:	yes but i can't use my old pine or a new pine
g:	yeah a single old pine
M:	i don't know how you'd get that from the picture.
g:	and down down as far as that okay
M:	u dogetipbot 50 doge verify
g:	but you know beneath the start
M:	there's a way
g:	so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
M:	i go up to the forge
g:	over the pine
M:	under the forge
g:	yeah more or less
M:	i go right up
g:	as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
M:	so... how far can i go?
g:	worry too much about the exact
M:	not really
g:	route but eh
M:	i have a torch and a torch.
g:	right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest
M:	i don't know how to do that.
g:	you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	huh? how do i do that?
g:	you've got a bay there
M:	and a pine tree
g:	i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top
M:	i dont have a tree there
g:	have you got a bay at the bottom
M:	uhhhhhhhhhhh
g:	crane bay
M:	which one is it?
g:	where's the one at the top
M:	what about the one above it?
g:	how far down
M:	theres a way to get the screenshot up
g:	yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	goin for the bay
g:	okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
M:	that's the bay.
g:	okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields
M:	h
g:	on your map no well the
M:	what if i just go to the bottom right?
g:	you have right
M:	no, it's a map
g:	well just draw the arc and stop the arc you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest okay
M:	i dont know i didnt draw it.
g:	oh two or three inches down from the pine forest okay you know it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields okay but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there above the bakery in other words above the eh
M:	it's a joke
g:	well er you know imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's it's on mine but imagine where it would be
M:	im in the forge
g:	about two inches down from that in in between the the forge and the old pine
M:	how far down
g:	on the left-hand side okay so where are you now
M:	the forge is right there
g:	mmhmm no no no
M:	up to the forge where you meet the new guys, then we'll get to the other side
g:	no don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line
M:	can i stop?
g:	never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything
M:	no i mean the line, not the wheat field
g:	just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	i am just wondering how you did it
g:	okay and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is
M:	i am
g:	you see what i
M:	ohh i see
g:	yeah but stop when you get just to above the bakery
M:	you can see what im going to do right now
g:	then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery
M:	i'm not sure what you mean. i can't draw circles on the ground.
g:	yeah right round it uh-huh
M:	what is the best way to do that?
g:	underneath the bakery
M:	in the corner
g:	have you got a canal
M:	under the bakery.
g:	no well the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery
M:	i think you mean the canal
g:	eh take your line down to crane bay oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway so you get to the canal right you don't have one but just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve okay of crane bay
M:	the two little wheatfields
g:	but not don't go down just go along don't go don't go down where it it really curves away there don't don't follow that
M:	yeah...
g:	so you're at the top left-hand side of crane bay right just northwest of where it says crane
M:	i'm on the right
g:	"or the where the ""c"" is"
M:	what about the crane bay?
g:	i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about
M:	what are you talking about?
g:	okay so you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half okay to to avoid the wheatfields which are just to the left of crane bay so you go down there right
M:	so i'm not wrong?
g:	go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left have you got a rocket warehouse
M:	
g:	well just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact okay
M:	how do you know when you have a rocket farm?
g:	an an inch or so above the rocket warehouse but to the left of it go round it the same way as you went round the igloo but on the other side okay just follow it round
M:	i don't get it
g:	go down the left-hand side of the page once you've done that
M:	i know right? how do you do that?
g:	have you got a lighthouse
M:	the building in the background
g:	the rocket warehouse
M:	where are you standing?
g:	the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished
M:	i can help u in a sec
g:	on the left-hand side of it
M:	where is the cross?
g:	well yeah that would be okay
M:	right i just wanna know how far the cross is
g:	uh-huh and just the cross is right you know the left-hand side of the lighthouse just next to it
M:	oh okay.
g:	okay got it
M:	uhhhh... yes.
g:	right that's it finished
