M:	right i just got the map
g:	the remote village is about
M:	the village
g:	are you just you should have gone just right under the pyramid should
M:	it's not a pyramid, it's a triangle
g:	right exactly right come across a tad 'til you are roughly a centimetre from the white mountain if you take a line up but not you know so that your line is the same direction that you took the line under the pyramid
M:	i'm a bit far away but i'll try and see what i can do
g:	just take it a wee bit further across so that you'll clear the remote village
M:	what is the right way to do this?
g:	right
M:	right right
g:	you're actually above it
M:	you can't see it because you're not on the map
g:	if you if you take a line due south you're going to hit it all i want you to do is clear the remote village
M:	i want to take a road
g:	yes you are just you are just below the pyramid
M:	but you are not in the remote village
g:	you've come out about a centimetre from

g:	are you
M:	i am
g:	why
M:	i don't know
g:	yeah you're under the pyramid okay right
M:	i am
g:	but you haven't gone far enough across so that you're so that if you came south you'd hit the white mountain
M:	i go to the pyramid and then south
g:	well that's wrong then
M:	i've come across plenty of people who have gone far too
g:	go go back so that you'll just miss the remote village if you come south
M:	yeah i know. but im just saying that i have come to the right place.
g:	right ah so come down
M:	oh my god that's amazing

g:	"just past the remote village and mark ""x"" 'cause that's us finished a complete trial"
M:	how close to the edge of the village?
