M:	it's just a little curve
g:	uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest
M:	how do you get to the burnt tree?
g:	right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
M:	right i can see it
g:	understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
M:	understood, what is it going to?
g:	no
M:	have they gone to the wrong end?
g:	no you just see how
M:	is this a joke
g:	uh-huh you just
M:	i think you just got the joke
g:	uh-huh it's just a slight curve
M:	huh u just
g:	uh-huh and then back to the left
M:	um, and then the right
g:	okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath
M:	yeah i think so
g:	right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
M:	no its just a regular ravine that i built
g:	right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
M:	right, that's the way it is
g:	uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine
M:	right go go
g:	mmhmm
M:	right go ahead
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	uhuh uh uh
g:	uh-huh right do you have the remote village
M:	uhh what?
g:	right well it doesn't doesn't matter
M:	right i don't care
g:	uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then
M:	i have to go now, but i'll be back later
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	umm how are you now?
g:	and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
M:	uhhuh but then you have to go in a circle
g:	uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove
M:	huhuh uh
g:	right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
M:	and then i'm going to the bottom of the tree
g:	but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
M:	yes and i'm not near the pinegrove
g:	so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right
M:	i'm not sure.
g:	see what i mean
M:	i don't think you know what a line is
g:	so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
M:	i don't understand what you mean
g:	mmhmm
M:	i'm guessing you are in the bottom right corner?
g:	no not touching
M:	yes touching
g:	okay
M:	not touching it
g:	right right have you got the concealed hideout
M:	open and shut case
g:	oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout
M:	you mean the one on the bottom right?
g:	okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
M:	yeah i have that, i've got the hideout on the bottom left.
g:	okay moving down all the time
M:	well i've been doing it for a while and i'm still curving it
g:	you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're
M:	what's going to happen?
g:	uh-huh
M:	it's a secret
g:	right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout
M:	i know what happens, but what happens when you go straight to the middle of the cover?
g:	no
M:	do you go to the bottom?
g:	no
M:	do you curve?
g:	no you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
M:	so i'm going to the wrong hideout right?
g:	mmhmm
M:	no its not
g:	'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right again
M:	what are you doing?
g:	uh-huh
M:	huh?
g:	right okay ehm right so you're where are you now then
M:	i am not
g:	okay right ehm have you got the boat house
M:	yes i have
g:	right what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat house
M:	right ehm how do you do that?
g:	no bottom right-hand corner of the boat house
M:	bottom left
g:	right okay right have you got the crane bay
M:	i'm in the boat with you.
g:	right you're going to go straight down eh straight down to the crane bay
M:	right i'm going to do it
g:	uh-huh
M:	u have a boat
g:	oh is it
M:	the boat house.
g:	oh you've got a different boat house i've got two boat houses
M:	uhhhmmm... hmmm...
g:	uh-huh so we've made a mistake you
M:	u got 2 btw
g:	right okay you see my boat house is to the left of the concealed hideout
M:	its just a hideout, so you can hide in the water and not risk drowning
g:	right okay sorry that's the wrong one you don't wanna go anywhere near that one right
M:	the one on the right is the one on top
g:	uh-huh just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout
M:	you can't change the map...
g:	right so so we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideout
M:	yup and then u
g:	mmhmm
M:	bottom left
g:	right okay
M:	i have no idea
g:	right you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page okay
M:	mmmhmmm...
g:	to to the left of the page not not right along i mean it in a i mean in a left direction
M:	oh right
g:	mmhmm under that uh-huh
M:	under the concealed hiding hideout?
g:	right don't go right right you can go a bit further about another inch
M:	right what am i looking at
g:	okay now right look down to the crane bay right
M:	i'm just a bit more right now
g:	ehm straight down from that have you got an actual wee bay there like curves
M:	there is a crane bay?
g:	from where you are at the moment
M:	straight up?
g:	right so we'll go straight down then straight down and don't hit the bay but but follow that curve in the bay so you're going to go straight down south
M:	that's how you get stuck on the bottom of the lake
g:	okay
M:	you can go straight up, you'll hit the sea
g:	have you done that then
M:	go straight up then go down
g:	right
M:	how do you say that?
g:	right have you got the coconut palm
M:	yes sir
g:	hmm have you got the pebbled shore
M:	yes i do
g:	which is where is it on your map
M:	oh no
g:	oh you've got another boat house
M:	i have a boat house.
g:	uh-huh but right have oh god right where are you now again
M:	oh yeah, i did that right
g:	mmhmm
M:	he nods you can't really know what's going on, but you can know that it's not a bad thing
g:	mmhmm
M:	yes yes
g:	right
M:	i think you mean the c
g:	right that's perfect right so you're going to come down and follow that wee curve
M:	oh i'm sorry i'm not good at that, i'll just take it
g:	right
M:	right so youre going to follow the curve
g:	to the left
M:	of the stick
g:	straight down and then left
M:	up and then down
g:	"okay so you're you're sort of on on the corner on the bit that juts out now above the ""c"" of crane"
M:	i don't know, i don't have any idea.
g:	is that right
M:	u are a little slow
g:	right now right what you're going to do now is moving down all the time but you're you're not going to follow the coastline as much you're going to slightly move away from it
M:	right... you're right
g:	okay eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half
M:	hmm... ok...
g:	uh-huh
M:	how far do you go?
g:	ehm uh-huh yes more or less but don't go as far as that
M:	so, it's a river?
g:	okay 'cause you're going to go you're about an a centimetre above the pebbled shore and you're going to go along the top of the pebbled shore
M:	yeah but what if i'm in a boat
g:	moving eh left
M:	hmhmhmhmm yeah
g:	okay then so you're about so once right where are you now
M:	i'm a little out of the way
g:	right okay move you're going to move to the left but moving down at the same time
M:	ok im moving now
g:	okay until you for about two or three inches until you're about a centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
M:	i'm not really sure what i'm doing.
g:	no
M:	have you washed stones?
g:	where are your uh-huh you should be about a couple of inches below it but not directly under it
M:	how do you do that?
g:	uh-huh
M:	where's the blue line?
g:	a good bit to the left of it
M:	ohh yeah
g:	uh-huh
M:	uhh, on the right side of that page
g:	okay where's your stones
M:	ok, where's the left side of your page?
g:	right okay well you're going to curve round them right have you got the flagship
M:	oh, yeah that's what i meant
g:	and the bit and the bit of land that juts out well and the bit that's
M:	yes, i know
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	uhuhuh uhuh
g:	right so what you're going to is curve round your stones there and your the finish is just ehm about a centimetre from that black line that's marking the crane bay just directly across from the ship
M:	it's a bit of a circle, so it looks like the one you're trying to get across is a bit out of the way.
g:	right
M:	right and you are
