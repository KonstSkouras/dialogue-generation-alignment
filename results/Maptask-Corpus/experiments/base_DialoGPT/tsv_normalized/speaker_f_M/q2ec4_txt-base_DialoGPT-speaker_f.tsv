f:	right start from the cross yeah
M:	can you give me a rough estimate of the distance?
f:	it's directly down yeah
M:	i have one.
f:	mm no i haven't got any wagon wheel
M:	do you have the diamond?
f:	to the right i've got eventually a cactus
M:	i've got a wooden rock to the left
f:	oh i've got a rift valley above that
M:	it's a wagon wheel.
f:	you've got the rift valley right up at the top right-hand side
M:	i've got it, but i'm not sure what i'm doing
f:	mmhmm
M:	i don't know what you're talking about
f:	towards the right-hand corner
M:	under what corner?
f:	ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that
M:	if you go to the cactus thing you can get it on the right hand corner
f:	hang on hang on right an inch to the right of the diamond mine
M:	right side of the cacti?
f:	yeah and then straight down to an inch below it
M:	yeah i know what that is, i was just curious
f:	yeah
M:	they arent really, you should probably be ok
f:	okay to right to the edge of the page
M:	ok then go left and go right
f:	er right okay that takes me to
M:	go right to page
f:	okay
M:	okays i will go to page 3 and then page 4
f:	okay hang on
M:	ok now the page is back up
f:	have you got the rift valley there 'cause i've got the rift valley right up in that top right-hand corner
M:	i can do that
f:	yeah
M:	have u ever gotten through the rifts?
f:	right go through the centre i'll just take it up and go through the centre yeah
M:	okay so you're not going to get past the rift?
f:	right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up
M:	you're not getting past me
f:	okay right
M:	i'm going to the bottom
f:	i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page
M:	ok just so you know, you're right
f:	alright there we go
M:	i think i should have done it straight up but it's up to you
f:	not quite
M:	that's what i said
f:	was i
M:	you got me there
f:	right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so
M:	it's in the rift valleys
f:	yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page
M:	i have a rift valley
f:	right and i was supposed to start above it there and come down through it
M:	i was supposed, i'm in the middle of the rift valley
f:	well i've done it back to front but never mind right eh so i should now be below it
M:	its a little more complicated than that
f:	yeah
M:	yeah i do
f:	erm no i've got the rocks i've got like two rocks
M:	so do you want to trade?
f:	and again a couple of inches below that i've got outlaws' hideout
M:	uhh... and again a few inches below the water
f:	but i haven't got anything else round about that area
M:	you're right. i'll have to do that
f:	er right over i've got rapids about three inches across from the rocks
M:	i've got a bit of dirt around the top of the rock and it's not quite as nice as that
f:	through the centre of the two rocks
M:	is that where the rapids are?
f:	right okay so is it well okay alright i think i've got this the first part of this is a total state
M:	we're on the top of the hill
f:	er well that'll be the rapids
M:	okay cool i'll try to get some of the other stuff done
f:	no i've got
M:	okay ok do you have a white water above your rock creek?
f:	i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine
M:	i'll take the white water.
f:	but you know right right back at the start
M:	the best part is the water
f:	nope
M:	you mean to the rapian's right?
f:	am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks
M:	it's the opposite
f:	so where's where do i go from there
M:	at the moment im just to the right of the rock
f:	taking it round from the top or
M:	what are you doing?
f:	right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids
M:	theres a few of them, and the one with the giant white thing on the ground
f:	oh i see what you mean yeah
M:	i think you mean that they will come to the rapades, but stay there for a while
f:	have you got a manned fort below the rapids
M:	i mean you can just walk up to the rapid and take it and go up to their encampment
f:	'cause i've got that interrupting er like almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned fort
M:	you know you're gonna have to make a fort with that line, right?
f:	eh oh right
M:	i think i have a stone creek, i'll check later
f:	yeah it's right the way down below the manned fort have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the bottom
M:	it's right up the hill, there's a stone creek above it
f:	yeah no in right in between the two of those i've got a manned fort
M:	it's right above the minecraft fort in the bottom left corner, the one with the rock and the rock monster.
f:	er about two inches maybe two and a half
M:	how far down?
f:	the stone creek and the stone slabs
M:	what's the difference between a stone and a slab?
f:	which way do you want me to go round the left or the right-hand side of that
M:	go go go go
f:	right okay
M:	i think it's the other way around
f:	right so it's a diagonal across the page towards that
M:	yeah and then it's an angle so you can get the horizontal line
f:	that sounds a bit drastic right
M:	theres a small line at the top that goes down to the end of the line, so you can go from there to the right
f:	yeah have you got a gold mine there as well just
M:	yes, i'm in the same place
f:	just to below and to the right of the outlaws' hideout i've got a gold mine
M:	alright thanks
f:	i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mines
M:	you got anything to trade?
f:	erm no
M:	can you be my friend?
f:	er i've got a saloon bar right down on the left-hand side
M:	u got a palace bar?
f:	short cut yeah
M:	i think i'm gonna go with a little more than that.
f:	mmhmm i'm well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it but
M:	oh god, you have a bar?
f:	yeah
M:	have you found anything?
f:	"not directly below it just just below the ""u"" if you take it down from the hideout er that that's just that's just at the left-hand side"
M:	what's the best way to get it to show up?
f:	but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of that
M:	yea, i was going to do a cave, but the whole thing was too much
f:	'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left
M:	why is your stone on the other end of the block?
f:	the gold mine is
M:	i think it's just to the other end of the block
f:	mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description
M:	i don't think the gold mine of gold is the best description for a stone.
f:	on its right-hand side
M:	it's on the right hand side
f:	so that's like towards the edge of the paper here
M:	its a noose
f:	right there we go i've come right down below that
M:	right where it is
f:	i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at all
M:	the salt water line is down to the bottom of the ocean.
f:	you know like below that i should say i mean in the in the middle and to above them and the stone slabs
M:	the stone wall
f:	mmhmm
M:	so, where is the saloons bar?
f:	right so i've to avoid that
M:	yeah it's called the ocean
f:	so go above it
M:	yeah, i think i'm gonna try to avoid it
f:	phoar
M:	what's your favorite type of hotdog?
f:	that's it yeah
M:	i think you mean phoar.
f:	what the first bit of that was a total disaster
M:	yeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhh... you're not alone
f:	'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through it
M:	why do you say that?
f:	'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there
