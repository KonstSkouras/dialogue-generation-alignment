M:	you have to go up to the top
g:	pass them on your their left
M:	right, and how do you pass them?
g:	uh-huh right and then have you got a forge underneath the cliffs
M:	pass the on the right and the bottom pass the on their left.
g:	oh have you got an old pine tree sort of down diagonally right from the cliffs
M:	yeah i do
g:	right well sort of pretend there's a forge right below the cliffs right and instead of right so you go down round the bottom of the forge so like draw a sort of a pretend semicircle
M:	i can't think of anything
g:	well like you know a pretend loop
M:	what do you mean?
g:	right start right so you're just below the cliffs
M:	i don't know what that means
g:	right so you go out towards outside of the map
M:	I'm in the mountains, so the map is in the middle of the mountains
g:	yeah and then round the bottom of the forge which isn't there
M:	it's in the middle of the cliff
g:	but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
M:	that's not there
g:	right and then you go up the inside of the pine tree
M:	yeah but i can't get up there because it's a firepit
g:	right not no that the left of the pine tree so the that's outside of the map
M:	right the outside of that tree
g:	uh-huh
M:	you know, the right of the pines
g:	uh-huh
M:	u want to go there
g:	yeah
M:	uhhuh? the tree is on your left
g:	and then so you get to the top of the pine tree
M:	I'll do it, but I'll have to go to work now
g:	right and then go vertically across to about two thirds across the page
M:	and what are you going to do about it?
g:	horizontally sorry
M:	you're on a list now
g:	uh-huh have you got a pine forest on right
M:	turn around
g:	well you slope down with the pine forest on your right
M:	what is the pattern on your feet?
g:	aha so don't go round the pine forest just like pass down by it
M:	nah, it's the slope on the left
g:	"right and then just where the word pine forest is just stop at the ""p"""
M:	so just stop right there
g:	right and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop
M:	right, but the point is just right.
g:	what
M:	i can do this, but i can't do it right now
g:	no i haven't got a stream i suppose just avoid the stream but sort of like as though
M:	i think you mean a bit more
g:	you're drawing a nose right say this is the face you're drawing and then you've got to sort of do a sort of round bit for the nose
M:	i am drawing a face i think
g:	beneath the pine forest uh-huh
M:	and the face of the tree
g:	right have you got a bakery underneath right a bit lower down
M:	bend the knee, bend the knee
g:	right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face
M:	you know what?
g:	right that should be just above the bakery
M:	right do you want me to take it back to the nose
g:	is that okay
M:	I'm good
g:	and then go and do another big nose round the bakery
M:	then do another one
g:	uh-huh and then come right back in
M:	you're not gonna give me a good answer
g:	underneath the bakery and maybe in past the bakery about two centimetres just before the canal have you got a canal
M:	yes! i want to see the tree!
g:	all right right just come in two centimetres towards the middle
M:	yeah i can do that. do you want me to come back in a couple of hours?
g:	from the bakery
M:	where do you want me to meet you?
g:	"right and then are you sort of above the ""e"" in crane bay"
M:	i am from crane bay and i am looking for the right and the second
g:	right well go down towards the coast
M:	i dont know where crane bay is
g:	right and then follow the crane bay round the coast
M:	right then
g:	"to the to the left it's towards the ""c"" of crane bay"
M:	I'm pretty sure it's in the middle of the map.
g:	right and eh then it's sort of have you got wheatfields
M:	ok then its towards the to right it's toward the to a a
g:	oh you got a rocket warehouse
M:	that's what i meant, i meant the ones that are on the top and they're not in the top left
g:	mm right okay is that sort of above the lighthouse
M:	I think you have to be in the lighthouse to get the crates.
g:	right well sort of sticking to the coast you know where the coast goes up and down vertical
M:	I dont have a warehouse
g:	right sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
M:	yes mister
g:	uh-huh
M:	about the mountain
g:	and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
M:	how would you get the top right side of a page?
g:	uh-huh
M:	left out to page
g:	the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
M:	left the page to draw a line
g:	no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
M:	the rocket part?
g:	right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
M:	it is a bit hard to read
g:	for about two centimetres
M:	for a minute
g:	and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave
M:	yes, and then we will start to build a house
g:	you going to hit it
M:	I'm going to make it a rocket
g:	okay
M:	just don't go in too far
g:	yes yeah oh will that put you in the sea
M:	and then go down further
