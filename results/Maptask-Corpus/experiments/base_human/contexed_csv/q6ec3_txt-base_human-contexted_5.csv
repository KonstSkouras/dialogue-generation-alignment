63,but don't actually go near them,okay,if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars,yeah so i'm straight up i'm now at the top of the waterfall ehm not quite halfway up the page,and you've got the lost steps,straight up
64,yeah okay that's fine,but don't actually go near them,okay,if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars,yeah so i'm straight up i'm now at the top of the waterfall ehm not quite halfway up the page,and you've got the lost steps
65,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left,yeah okay that's fine,but don't actually go near them,okay,if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars,yeah so i'm straight up i'm now at the top of the waterfall ehm not quite halfway up the page
66,uh-huh,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left,yeah okay that's fine,but don't actually go near them,okay,if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars
67,you'll miss the lost steps,uh-huh,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left,yeah okay that's fine,but don't actually go near them,okay
68,okay and how far along do i move,you'll miss the lost steps,uh-huh,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left,yeah okay that's fine,but don't actually go near them
69,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move,you'll miss the lost steps,uh-huh,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left,yeah okay that's fine
70,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move,you'll miss the lost steps,uh-huh,and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left
71,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move,you'll miss the lost steps,uh-huh
72,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move,you'll miss the lost steps
73,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page,okay and how far along do i move
74,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine,um to about just before the middle of the page
75,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them,fine
76,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars,and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
77,do you have an obstacle there,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end,uh-huh okay that's fine i'm now halfway along underneath the fallen pillars
78,i do flamingoes,do you have an obstacle there,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay,right just keep going 'til the end
79,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve,i do flamingoes,do you have an obstacle there,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres,okay
80,uh-huh yeah,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve,i do flamingoes,do you have an obstacle there,yeah,of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres
81,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page,uh-huh yeah,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve,i do flamingoes,do you have an obstacle there,yeah
82,yeah,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page,uh-huh yeah,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve,i do flamingoes,do you have an obstacle there
83,then do you have ancient ruins,yeah,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page,uh-huh yeah,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve,i do flamingoes
84,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment,then do you have ancient ruins,yeah,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page,uh-huh yeah,well uh i think you're probably trying to avoid that so if you go down um and then left in a sort of curve
85,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment,then do you have ancient ruins,yeah,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page,uh-huh yeah
86,yeah yeah uh-huh,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment,then do you have ancient ruins,yeah,and up again and you're pretty near the edge of the page
87,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit,yeah yeah uh-huh,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment,then do you have ancient ruins,yeah
88,yeah,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit,yeah yeah uh-huh,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment,then do you have ancient ruins
89,without actually coming into contact with them,yeah,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit,yeah yeah uh-huh,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left,um ruined city is about three quarters up on the page and just slightly to the right of where i am at the moment
90,yeah okay so i'm i'm moving right basically,without actually coming into contact with them,yeah,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit,yeah yeah uh-huh,yeah okay just like a bit up from the fallen pillars and to the left
91,a straight line,yeah okay so i'm i'm moving right basically,without actually coming into contact with them,yeah,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit,yeah yeah uh-huh
92,right now do i move up so that i'm level with the ruined city,a straight line,yeah okay so i'm i'm moving right basically,without actually coming into contact with them,yeah,well you want to sort of come towards the ancient ruins a bit
