122,mmhmm yeah,imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you,mmhmm,right and see where the pebbled shore is,mmhmm,right see see where the flagship is
123,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there,mmhmm yeah,imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you,mmhmm,right and see where the pebbled shore is,mmhmm
124,ehm bypassing pebbled shore,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there,mmhmm yeah,imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you,mmhmm,right and see where the pebbled shore is
125,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page,ehm bypassing pebbled shore,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there,mmhmm yeah,imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you,mmhmm
126,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page,ehm bypassing pebbled shore,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there,mmhmm yeah,imagine a a triangle with ehm an equilateral triangle with the pebbled shore flagship and finish right can you
127,yeah uh-huh,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page,ehm bypassing pebbled shore,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there,mmhmm yeah
128,uh-huh and down like,yeah uh-huh,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page,ehm bypassing pebbled shore,sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there
129,no no not to the right,uh-huh and down like,yeah uh-huh,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page,ehm bypassing pebbled shore
130,the right as you face the map,no no not to the right,uh-huh and down like,yeah uh-huh,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore,it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page
131,no,the right as you face the map,no no not to the right,uh-huh and down like,yeah uh-huh,so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore
132,well what side then,no,the right as you face the map,no no not to the right,uh-huh and down like,yeah uh-huh
133,the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore,well what side then,no,the right as you face the map,no no not to the right,uh-huh and down like
134,uh-huh,the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore,well what side then,no,the right as you face the map,no no not to the right
135,well just draw in a diagonal to your left,uh-huh,the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore,well what side then,no,the right as you face the map
136,to the end of the page,well just draw in a diagonal to your left,uh-huh,the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore,well what side then,no
137,mmhmm right quite far down,to the end of the page,well just draw in a diagonal to your left,uh-huh,the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore,well what side then
