64,yes,and do you have a desert,yes,now do you have a walled city,passing above it right,right take the southwest direction
65,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city,yes,and do you have a desert,yes,now do you have a walled city,passing above it right
66,between them,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city,yes,and do you have a desert,yes,now do you have a walled city
67,uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city,between them,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city,yes,and do you have a desert,yes
68,right okay,uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city,between them,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city,yes,and do you have a desert
69,okay,right okay,uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city,between them,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city,yes
70,but i'm that's not in a straight line,okay,right okay,uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city,between them,well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city
71,oh that's fair enough right just just go between those two,but i'm that's not in a straight line,okay,right okay,uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city,between them
