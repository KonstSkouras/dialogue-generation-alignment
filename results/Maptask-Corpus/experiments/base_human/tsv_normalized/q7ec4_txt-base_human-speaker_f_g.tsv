g:	we're starting down at the bottom right-hand corner nearly
f:	right
g:	have you got crest falls
f:	mmhmm
g:	well directly above them maybe about three quarters of an inch above there is the start point
f:	yeah
g:	go along to the the left
f:	my left or the paper's left towards the banana tree
g:	there's no banana tree in this one
f:	well my left yeah paper left uh-huh right
g:	uh-huh well say the top's north and
f:	right
g:	go west
f:	okey-dokey
g:	until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
f:	right
g:	"and then come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and a level with the ""c"" and maybe about an inch to west of the ""c"""
f:	mm okey-dokey
g:	right and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper
f:	right
g:	now do you have a footbridge
f:	just north of the banana tree yeah
g:	right go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge
f:	mmhmm
g:	right and then the path the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge now do you have a poisoned stream there
f:	no not at all
g:	well just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half
f:	right
g:	uh-huh and then och take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then do you have an old temple
f:	yes
g:	right go along eastward for about two inches
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old temple
f:	rightee-ho
g:	mmhmm now go up about two and a half inches do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there
f:	nothing up until a poisoned stream
g:	right what about do you have an abandoned truck
f:	what way to the left of it
g:	uh-huh
f:	yeah
g:	is there anything between the old temple and the truck
f:	eh slate mountain
g:	right i don't have that
f:	mmhmm
g:	go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it
f:	right
g:	and then and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees
f:	mmhmm
g:	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the
f:	up past the truck and the mountain
g:	something uh-huh
f:	right
g:	and then back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to your abandoned truck just below it
f:	right
g:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
f:	mmhmm
g:	"until you're just below the ""a"""
f:	right
g:	now have you got baboons
f:	no
g:	right now come due south
f:	yeah
g:	about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then due west for about two inches uh then
f:	right
g:	do you have a white mountain further up
f:	yes uh-huh
g:	"right now well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the ""a"" and the come up to make that a ""u"" shape"
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain
f:	right
g:	right now mm go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then change to going due north for about three inches
f:	up past the lemon grove
g:	ah there's no lemon grove in this one
f:	right
g:	right is there a pyramid
f:	mmhmm
g:	yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
f:	mmhmm
g:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
f:	will we walk to the top of it
g:	no straight across until
f:	right
g:	on the same level
f:	okey-dokey
g:	and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
f:	yeah
g:	right do you have a cobbled street
f:	no
g:	right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
f:	directly below it
g:	ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
f:	right so it'll be mmhmm
g:	"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid"
f:	right
g:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
f:	right
g:	right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south
f:	right
g:	to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
f:	mmhmm
g:	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
f:	yeah
g:	just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there
f:	right
g:	"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote"
f:	mmhmm
g:	"and then straight across until you're below the ""e"""
f:	"the ""e"" in remote"
g:	"the ""e"" in village sorry"
f:	"""e"" in village right"
g:	and then go straight across another inch and that's the finish
f:	okey-dokey there we go have i missed anything
