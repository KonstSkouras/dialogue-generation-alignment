g:	right okay have you got the start up at the top left-hand corner
f:	uh-huh
g:	to the left of the burnt forest
f:	yeah
g:	right okay ehm right you're going to start coming down but but as you come down you're you curve to the right
f:	to the right
g:	uh-huh just just below the burnt forest without touching the burnt forest
f:	right how far
g:	right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
f:	uh-huh
g:	understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
f:	have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage
g:	no
f:	how how far below the burnt forest do i go do i go right along the beneath it before i curve
g:	no you just see how
f:	i just go past it
g:	uh-huh you just
f:	so it's only a slight curve
g:	uh-huh it's just a slight curve
f:	to the right and then back to the left
g:	uh-huh and then back to the left
f:	right uh-huh
g:	okay so you're about eh three to four inches below start then directly underneath
f:	mm mmhmm
g:	right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
f:	uh-huh
g:	right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
f:	below it
g:	uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine
f:	right so i go along to the right
g:	mmhmm
f:	until i'm about an inch below the ravine but to the left of it
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
f:	and then i go up past the left-hand side of it
g:	uh-huh right do you have the remote village
f:	no
g:	right well it doesn't doesn't matter
f:	i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine
g:	uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then
f:	still to the left of it
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
f:	uh-huh
g:	and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
f:	have you got the pine grove
g:	uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove
f:	mmhmm
g:	right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
f:	right
g:	but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
f:	okay
g:	so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right
f:	okay mmhmm
g:	see what i mean
f:	uh-huh
g:	so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
f:	bottom left-hand corner
g:	mmhmm
f:	but not ehm touching it or
g:	no not touching
f:	right
g:	okay
f:	uh-huh
g:	right right have you got the concealed hideout
f:	uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though
g:	oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout
f:	uh-huh
g:	okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
f:	mmhmm
g:	okay moving down all the time
f:	along what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it
g:	you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're
f:	towards the concealed hideout
g:	uh-huh
f:	where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout
g:	right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout
f:	but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove
g:	no
f:	so it's not much of a curve
g:	no
f:	right eh and i end up to the left of the concealed hideout
g:	no you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
f:	along the top of it right
g:	mmhmm
f:	okay
g:	'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right again
f:	mmhmm
g:	uh-huh
f:	no but i haven't hit anything so
g:	right okay ehm right so you're where are you now then
f:	i'm to the right of the concealed hideout
g:	okay right ehm have you got the boat house
f:	uh-huh
g:	right what you're going to do is you're going to curve round the concealed hideout going round the right of it and then straight along until you get to the boat house the bottom left-hand corner of the boat house
f:	left
g:	no bottom right-hand corner of the boat house
f:	okay
g:	right okay right have you got the crane bay
f:	uh-huh
g:	right you're going to go straight down eh straight down to the crane bay
f:	and to the right of the boat house

f:	you've got two
g:	uh-huh so we've made a mistake you
f:	well which which
g:	right okay you see my boat house is to the left of the concealed hideout
f:	well mine's to the right and below it
g:	right okay sorry that's the wrong one you don't wanna go anywhere near that one right
f:	"right so will i do a ""u""-turn"
g:	uh-huh just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout
f:	okay
g:	right so so we'll say we're at the bottom right-hand corner of the concealed hideout
f:	bottom right
g:	mmhmm
f:	uh-huh
g:	right okay
f:	mmhmm
g:	right you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page okay
f:	the left
g:	to to the left of the page not not right along i mean it in a i mean in a left direction
f:	towards the you mean under the concealed hideout
g:	mmhmm under that uh-huh
f:	right i'm going along under the i'm now at the bottom left-hand corner of the the concealed hideout right
g:	right don't go right right you can go a bit further about another inch
f:	right
g:	okay now right look down to the crane bay right
f:	uh-huh
g:	ehm straight down from that have you got an actual wee bay there like curves
f:	straight down from where
g:	from where you are at the moment
f:	uh-huh uh-huh

g:	is that right
f:	uh-huh
g:	right now right what you're going to do now is moving down all the time but you're you're not going to follow the coastline as much you're going to slightly move away from it
f:	mmhmm
g:	okay eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half
f:	towards the pebbled shore

f:	straight towards it
g:	ehm uh-huh yes more or less but don't go as far as that
f:	mmhmm
g:	okay 'cause you're going to go you're about an a centimetre above the pebbled shore and you're going to go along the top of the pebbled shore
