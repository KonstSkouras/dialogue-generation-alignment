f:	aye but but the
g:	left yes
f:	i have a monument
g:	yeah
f:	fine
g:	then travel to the east just past the antelopes
f:	mountain and move yeah
g:	no you don't go to the bottom of the map
f:	and then i go up past the left-hand side of it
g:	right no below the flat rocks
f:	so it's like diagonally down
g:	well if you under directly underneath the mountain about three centimetres down there's a soft furnishings store
f:	yes i have a rocket warehouse
g:	the right yeah well you're getting from underneath the totem pole above which is above the great rock
f:	alright there we go
g:	if you if you take a line due south you're going to hit it all i want you to do is clear the remote village
f:	right okay right okay
g:	it's it's in the finishing point
f:	right
g:	and just that's your cross is there that's it finished
f:	uh-huh
g:	it goes down to where it says cliffs okay
f:	i'm just below the cliffs
g:	just a a couple of inches and then west
f:	uh-huh
g:	do you have a white mountain further up
f:	"i don't have ""x"" marks finished how far above the old temple"
g:	uh-huh yeah
f:	okay am i below the pebbled shore
g:	should be now yeah if your line's below the diamond mine you should be okay
f:	right to the top
g:	okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields
f:	okay mmhmm
g:	you want to just go over the top of that and round
f:	and then bandit territory right at the bottom
g:	go along to the end of the cattle stockade
f:	right how far underneath the diamond mine
g:	right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
f:	mmhmm
g:	before you reach the fort
f:	'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left
g:	until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
f:	right now is there anything i should be watching for
g:	right see the start
f:	right
g:	just beyond crest falls
f:	so i'm bypassing canoes yeah
g:	right beside it you just go straight down underneath it
f:	the right-hand side
g:	or just to the right of it okay i want you to you see where it comes down like that
f:	right
g:	well just draw the arc and stop the arc you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest okay
f:	right so i'm going above them
g:	oh you're at the walled city
f:	on its right-hand side
g:	go west
f:	mmhmm
g:	well that's wrong then
f:	but i'm that's not in a straight line
g:	of the fallen pillars yeah um now go down two or three centimetres
f:	yes
g:	right
f:	right there's a cattle ranch between your buffalo and your fort
g:	right have you got the lake
f:	the very end of the map
g:	up the map you'll then come to an abandoned cottage it should be on your left-hand side
f:	uh-huh yeah
g:	"or the where the ""c"" is"
f:	yeah okay
g:	no don't go don't go below the wooden pole
f:	but i haven't got anything else round about that area
g:	and you've got the lost steps
f:	and eh
g:	right sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
f:	right okay
g:	yeah okay um do you have a soft furnishings store
f:	yeah in a like as the two ends are pointing up towards top of the page
g:	yeah but stop when you get just to above the bakery
f:	uh-huh
g:	moving eh left
f:	right
g:	right now mm go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
f:	what way to the left of it
g:	right then pass pass below the ghost town
f:	but i have to go near it to go to the boat house
g:	go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left have you got a rocket warehouse
f:	ah you still i still don't know where your boat house is
g:	right and then the path the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge now do you have a poisoned stream there
f:	through the centre of the two rocks
g:	do you have a stone creek in that area
f:	right from
g:	okay you should see a trig point do you see
f:	oh well maybe you don't have canoe
g:	is that right
f:	inside or the aye to the inside or the outside of the map
g:	right you start at the top left
f:	okay
g:	you're actually above it
f:	"right right stop at the ""p"" right"
g:	the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that
f:	my right-hand edge of the map
g:	on the left-hand side okay so where are you now
f:	no
g:	well
f:	right okay
g:	no the initial line from the cross
f:	i'll have to i'll i'll have to kind of change it slightly 'cause i've taken it on the wrong side of this cactus thing i think i'll just do a slight detour right and just take it straight through towards the top of the page
g:	and then travel south and then
f:	pine forest on my right
g:	then you come straight down and right
f:	still to the left of it
g:	yeah
f:	is it
g:	right come due south from the edge of the footbridge straight south for about two inches
f:	aye right so i've been through a forest
g:	and pass that by go to your southwest of the apache camp
f:	down to the concealed hideout
g:	you should be round a hundred and eighty degrees around to the abandoned cottage and then turn right okay so you've what you've done is you went round
