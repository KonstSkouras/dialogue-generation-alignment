f:	i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mines
g:	well never mind you should be on the left-hand side of it but it should be on your left-hand side
f:	towards the concealed hideout
g:	from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove
f:	mmhmm
g:	so the abandoned cottage should now be below you on the map
f:	straight up
g:	you've got a lake now you skirt around the inside side of the lake that's side of the lake that is nearest to the middle of the map
f:	right
g:	right now right what you're going to do now is moving down all the time but you're you're not going to follow the coastline as much you're going to slightly move away from it
f:	yes
g:	uh-huh
f:	uh-huh
g:	right
f:	directly below it
g:	something uh-huh
f:	along the bottom and left
g:	and then you want to come down in a diagonal so that you've missed the fallen pillars and go underneath them
f:	uh-huh
g:	don't go round about it just go up before it
f:	uh-huh
g:	yeah more or less
f:	right
g:	without actually coming into contact with them
f:	mmhmm

g:	oh have you got an old pine tree sort of down diagonally right from the cliffs
f:	no so that's irrelevant
g:	right okay
f:	right okay
g:	about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're
f:	uh-huh
g:	mm right okay is that sort of above the lighthouse
f:	i can't i don't know if i'm supposed to tell you that
g:	right so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no right have you got anything below pebbled shore
f:	of the camp or of the map
g:	and right through

f:	past the top of it
g:	and then have you got lost steps
f:	up past the pine tree
