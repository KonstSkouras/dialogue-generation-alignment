f:	right i've come up by the abandoned cottage right i was heading straight up the map towards the top of the blackboard
g:	okay start off above the diamond mine
f:	right
g:	well but
f:	right
g:	right on my map there's a slate mountain you're traveling north
f:	right i i'm at the walled city right
g:	well i've got one i've got one to the left of the concealed hideout
f:	okay
g:	well you you need to be about two inch you you need to end up about two inches from the top there
f:	on the the bottom side of them pass them on the bottom
g:	go right go straight underneath the trout farm
f:	yeah
g:	between the walled city and what
f:	mmhmm
g:	mmhmm until you're like at the bottom of the kind of level with the bottom of the desert
f:	right right right that's it
g:	right that's it finished
f:	yeah it's that's underneath the avalanche
g:	you got to you've got to pass below the flat rocks
f:	right up so i'm sitting just above the antelopes
g:	right okay sorry that's the wrong one you don't wanna go anywhere near that one right
f:	i have cleared it right the remote village is like ah four inches below the pyramid in this
g:	but it's on on the same level as the pine tree
f:	the eh the bay bit that the flagship's in
g:	you want to avoid that so
f:	aye that's wrong
g:	emerging at the left-hand side of the fort and you've to finish opposite the base more or less opposite the base of the carved wooden pole
f:	uh-huh
g:	no you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
f:	uh-huh
g:	mmhmm and then north now have you got big white mountain
f:	uh-huh
g:	right until do you you you have no carved wooden pole at all
f:	right
g:	right
f:	of the map now i have a banana tree instead
g:	below the buffalo
f:	i'm i'm going to hit the round rocks no
g:	you don't have a forge well the forge is eh below the the cliffs say about two inches down okay so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve
f:	mmhmm
g:	never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything
f:	uh-huh okay
g:	no but right the way over
f:	uh-huh
g:	oh
f:	no
g:	underneath the diamond mine
f:	'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there
g:	okay the start part is at the top left-hand corner
f:	straight down from where
g:	i i don't suppose you've got a graveyard have you
f:	okay
g:	of the map
f:	mmhmm
g:	right oh well i don't have this on my map so ehm do you have flat rocks
f:	because you told me to come under the pyramid
g:	okay you're
f:	have you not got have you not got the carpenter's cottage
g:	you've got neither a graveyard nor a fast flowing river
f:	uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though
g:	aye right okay so you're saying they're it's to the right then this thing
f:	and i go right as far as the pine
g:	the right-hand side
f:	mmhmm
g:	okay that's fine now you've got the rope bridge
f:	okay
g:	aye get the tippex out
f:	on the left
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
f:	right
g:	uh-huh
f:	it's taking me straight buh up a up a up again
g:	right ehm go just beyond the crest falls to to well it's my left anyway mmhmm i think it
f:	i've got a parched river bed
g:	uh-huh just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout
f:	right okay oops that was
g:	have you got a canal
f:	mmhmm
g:	can you go between the pine grove and the avalanche
f:	that's it yeah
g:	well like you know a pretend loop
f:	uh-huh
g:	well
f:	right okay right i know what you mean right
g:	uh-huh
f:	to the right i've got eventually a cactus
g:	map right
f:	oh no i have got a gold mine but it's it's a it's a good bit below that
g:	so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
f:	so would it bypass the river
g:	right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
f:	phoar
g:	well just draw round it
f:	right
g:	go i would say go underneath the totem pole do you have a trout farm
f:	no
g:	is there
f:	right mm that's not where i am now right so where hang on right so
g:	i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about
f:	right i've got that i just misread you
g:	you're right up beside that
f:	mmhmm
g:	the start is ah here it's due north of the crest falls at the bottom right-hand side of your page
f:	uh-huh
g:	beneath the pine forest uh-huh
f:	mmhmm
g:	the rocket warehouse
f:	and straight down and
g:	right and then to your right again
f:	okay
g:	so you're at the top left-hand side of crane bay right just northwest of where it says crane
f:	it's underneath it to the right
g:	okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
f:	uh-huh
g:	i would imagine
f:	south
g:	"your rift valley is ""u""-shaped yeah"
f:	the right as you face the map
g:	right take the southwest direction
f:	okey-dokey
g:	right
f:	mmhmm
g:	no well the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery
f:	right okay
g:	and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
f:	left
g:	no don't go over the top of them
f:	to the no
g:	there's a savannah right you want to travel east until you get to before the savannah
f:	uh um okay right now i'm i'm on the left-hand side of the ruined city and about three quarters of the way up the page
g:	okay
f:	right
g:	you see the carved wooden pole at the bottom
f:	yeah have you got a gold mine there as well just
g:	so do you want to just go along to your right
f:	mmhmm
g:	well that's okay right now take that take the line is the cottage directly beside the ravine
f:	all right so you've the rope bridge and the waterfall and the fallen pillars so at the moment i'm at the waterfall
g:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
f:	okay
g:	okay right i that's fine right i want you to go draw to your to your right under the pine grove avoiding the avalanche
f:	right oh sorry okay
g:	okay
f:	mmhmm
g:	to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
f:	alright
g:	yeah
f:	uh-huh
g:	right do you have to the left of the indian country a great rock
f:	okay
g:	and then the finish is just ehm on a horizontal with the flagship near to the coast about a centimetre away from the coast
f:	mmhmm
g:	no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written
f:	how far right to my my left
g:	right and then go vertically across to about two thirds across the page
f:	uh-huh
g:	go along to the the left
f:	round the bakery
g:	and then up north
f:	can i just go straight to the saloon bar
g:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
f:	right okay erm i'm not that so i should be below there when i'm taking the line up
g:	yeah then you don't have anything else down like
f:	i've got to a lake
g:	you turn left
f:	so that's like towards the edge of the paper here
g:	oh aye sarah and danielle
f:	from the top
g:	keeping it always on your left
f:	but that's like at forty-five degrees south east
g:	do you have a desert
f:	not quite
g:	vertically right past burnt forest
f:	uh-huh
g:	how far down
f:	towards the you mean under the concealed hideout
g:	right do you have the cobbled street
f:	mmhmm
g:	okay er the lake should have a a bulge in it just at the top
f:	underneath the pine grove
g:	"right and then just where the word pine forest is just stop at the ""p"""
f:	mmhmm
g:	to the edge of the page
f:	nope
g:	a good bit to the left of it
f:	just the bottom
g:	and you should finish just past the the lake
f:	right uh-huh
g:	okay keep going 'til you find a lake
f:	right i know
g:	okay and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is
f:	mmhmm
g:	in between the rope bridge and the waterfall
f:	so that i end up on the left of what is the banana tree on this map or maybe the gorillas on yours
g:	yeah to about a couple of centimetres above the top of the bottom of the page
f:	mmhmm
g:	right head down towards that and then just curve down the left-hand side that
f:	okey-dokey oh that looks an
g:	you go up the map past the abandoned cottage turn left
f:	mmhmm below them
g:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
f:	good
g:	well
f:	uh-huh
g:	right that should be just above the bakery
f:	but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of that
g:	uh do you have a rope bridge
f:	er well that'll be the rapids
g:	we're starting down at the bottom right-hand corner nearly
f:	mmhmm
g:	uh we turn right there at that bulge okay since you don't have a trig point we'll use that instead
f:	no
g:	until you get to the hot wells
f:	mmhmm
g:	right and then you go up the inside of the pine tree
f:	right
g:	need to go go up above it and then down and under the saloon bar to the finish
f:	i'm above the pebbled shore to the left of it
g:	yes
f:	no
g:	about two inches down from that in in between the the forge and the old pine
f:	about quarter of the way up
g:	okay you got that
f:	level with the bottom of the lake
g:	no i've got nothing
f:	right
g:	"right and then are you sort of above the ""e"" in crane bay"
