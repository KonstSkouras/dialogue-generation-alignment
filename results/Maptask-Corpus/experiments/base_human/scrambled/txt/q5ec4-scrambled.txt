f|yes
g|mm-mm
f|right eh and i end up to the left of the concealed hideout
g|well you turn left so you're going up the map again
f|and it's on the left well i'm coming from the left to go to above it
g|aha so don't go round the pine forest just like pass down by it
f|uh-huh right now where
g|okay
f|right that's okay
g|um do you have anything between this cattle stockade and the bandit territory
f|well mine's to the right and below it
g|oh two or three inches down from the pine forest okay you know it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields okay but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there above the bakery in other words above the eh
f|yeah
g|right and then follow the crane bay round the coast
f|mmhmm
g|well have you got fallen pillars
f|yes
g|and you want to come south and round the antelopes
f|right
g|yeah
f|yeah
g|in a curve above the carved stones
f|see where i mean
g|you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
f|not in that corner
g|but above the carved wooden pole and above the stone creek
f|right okay
g|right now well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the "a" and the come up to make that a "u" shape
f|yeah okay so i'm i'm moving right basically
g|on your map no well the
f|i've just come down there
g|and then due west for about two inches uh then
f|right so it's a diagonal across the page towards that
g|okay and then just like a nice big curve heading down about six inches
f|okay
g|now you're going along
f|mmhmm
g|now keep heading to the right a bit
f|mmhmm
g|well i want you to avoid that
f|uh-huh
g|and then continue straight left along until about four centimetres from the end and then go straight up again
f|to the end of the page
g|okay until you for about two or three inches until you're about a centimetre from the left-hand side of the page
f|uh-huh
g|well directly above them maybe about three quarters of an inch above there is the start point
f|erm no
g|uh-huh
f|wait a minute sure i don't turn left
g|crane bay
f|and then go right
g|mmhmm until you just get past them then come down to them south
f|so how far am i from the left of the page
g|no i told you to turn left around the old abandoned cottage you turn right once you went round the cottage
f|right
g|right and see where the pebbled shore is
f|and then you told me to turn right
g|right underneath it and then just come back up 'til you're level with the top of the plant thing about a
f|mmhmm i'm well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it but
g|do you have an obstacle there
f|no
g|right you well right you're going past you're going up over stone creek and your line's just about touching where flat rocks is written
f|uh i'm nowhere near it
g|so you're about an inch away from the edge of the sheet of paper
f|i have come across far enough now
g|the left you've you've drawn above pebbled shore
f|is that beneath so is the nose to come beneath the pine forest
g|right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
f|uh-huh right okay
g|no
f|a bit flatter what on the same does this have have i to cross a stream
g|right should be a roman baths below the lake
f|no
g|sort of "c" shape to cover the bottom of a "c" right from when you pass down below the walled city
f|almost the extreme left of the page and about four centimetres up
g|but not don't go down just go along don't go don't go down where it it really curves away there don't don't follow that
f|yeah
g|no
f|okay right
g|turn left so that's two turns left after you come out the caravan park
f|er about two inches maybe two and a half
g|uh-huh and just the cross is right you know the left-hand side of the lighthouse just next to it
f|right how far
g|uh-huh uh-huh
f|right
g|but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
f|mmhmm
g|do you have cliffs just to to the right
f|okay yeah
g|no just up so that you're you're coming away from it up towards the top of the paper
f|right
g|so you want to come down from the mountain and turn sharp left
f|this edge here
g|uh-huh so that's over the top of the walled city
f|right
g|edge of the map
f|mmhmm
g|right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
f|immediately past the caravan park
g|yeah
f|right hold on wait a minute am i right under the sandstone cliffs
g|right okay right round the white water or right round the rapids
f|uh-huh
g|and that's you if you sort of curve off to the left
f|so i'm cut right okay
g|straight through yeah
f|uh-huh
g|come due south to level at the bottom of crest falls
f|bit underneath it and i've got a ravine right in the middle between they two
g|thought you did
f|right
g|mmhmm
f|okay and how far along do i move
g|above the right below the buffalo below the buffalo right
f|above the carved stones
g|to the side down by the side of the wigwams underneath this great rock
f|yes
g|no
f|no
g|well on mines there is and you come between the lake and the roman baths so you'll have to avoid them
