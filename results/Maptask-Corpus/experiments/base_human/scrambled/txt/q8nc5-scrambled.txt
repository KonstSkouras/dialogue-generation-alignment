f|right
g|okay you keep going up there
f|i've got the swamp and like directly above the rapids i've got a diamond mine

g|you turn round to a abandoned cottage so always keeping it on your left-hand side
f|the gold mine is
g|aye aye
f|and then turn right right
g|go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get to stop just above the ravine
f|and then to the along to the fort

g|have you done that then
f|right i'm going along under the i'm now at the bottom left-hand corner of the the concealed hideout right
g|no it's no how many sides of the abandoned cottage have you past

g|do you have an old pine
f|right
g|then do you have ancient ruins
f|ah where do i start ross
g|uh-huh right
f|i'm now at the top left-hand side of the ravine
g|go round the left-hand side
f|so this is about a ten inch line from the where i am just now
g|well pass from above the apache camp um and over the top of the walled city but between the desert and the walled city
f|have you got a manned fort below the rapids
g|go up past the monument
f|right
g|mmhmm
f|so i do i go to the left of the abandoned truck

g|no i've no got any canoes
f|aye
g|do you have a cavalry

g|then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery
f|no
g|mmhmm
f|right okay
g|go go back so that you'll just miss the remote village if you come south
f|right okay
g|and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
f|mmhmm
g|are you
f|top of the pine tree
g|it's about an inch or so
f|no
g|uh-huh and then och take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
f|right
g|and do you have a stone creek
f|right
g|right well sort of sticking to the coast you know where the coast goes up and down vertical
f|yeah
g|right you want to go right up north
f|yes
g|okay so you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half okay to to avoid the wheatfields which are just to the left of crane bay so you go down there right
f|mmhmm
g|so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
f|mmhmm mmhmm
g|see your apache camp
f|and i'm going am i going straight down
g|no it's a tiny bit okay and while you're doing that go in to your right a bit but it doesn't really matter okay ehm have you got a ravine

f|will we walk to the top of it
g|yeah
f|a forest
g|if you go straight up from the waterfall you keep going up until you're in line with the fallen pillars
f|mmhmm
g|and then back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to your abandoned truck just below it
f|right
g|right straight up north yeah and finish erm beyond the fort
f|right down there
g|two inches above it
f|no
g|do you see the carved wooden pole
f|right okay

f|it's directly down yeah
g|okay
f|okey-dokey there we go have i missed anything
g|right so you're taking a sort of north
f|nothing up until a poisoned stream
g|and then go round in a curve underneath the diamond mine
f|right okay i'm below the flat rocks
g|no no not sorry i i i don't mean through the two rocks i mean like to the left of the two rocks about an inch
f|right so i've got to go along and uh over a "u" shape right

g|now you should come to a fenced meadow on your right
f|do you go go right go to the right
g|okay
f|and down through
g|go round the monument keeping the monument always on your left
f|oh
g|right so what you're going to is curve round your stones there and your the finish is just ehm about a centimetre from that black line that's marking the crane bay just directly across from the ship
f|oh hang on i don't have a graveyard
g|okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
f|okay
g|yeah that's true and you don't have a stone creek above your white water
