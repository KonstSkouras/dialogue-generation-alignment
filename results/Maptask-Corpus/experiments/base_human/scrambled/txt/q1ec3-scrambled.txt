f|no i don't see a nuclear test site
g|the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished
f|towards the right-hand corner
g|yes
f|right up
g|to get past it yeah well draw that way
f|i don't go to the bottom of the map
g|it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page
f|uh-huh
g|no do you have a saloon bar
f|no
g|right go right up to the top of the page
f|mmhmm
g|all right right just come in two centimetres towards the middle
f|yeah
g|okay so you don't have a graveyard do you have a fast flowing river
f|right okay right so i go back left again i keep going left i go down then i go left
g|just take it a wee bit further across so that you'll clear the remote village
f|no i've had a fenced meadow but there's only another there's nae more fenced meadows
g|yes
f|no but i haven't hit anything so
g|right now turn to the west
f|mmhmm
g|as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
f|so i'm making a curve round the diamond mine yeah
g|and then you want to go sharp right
f|right well the boat house is sort of on crane bay beside it
g|eh starting at the top of the caravan park
f|and go past down below the cave
g|further until you're about an inch away from the edge of the paper
f|yeah
g|there's no banana tree in this one
f|mmhmm
g|okay where's your stones
f|er right okay that takes me to
g|great ehm okay head up ehm past stone creek you need to be going at about up curving up to the right at about a forty-five degree angle
f|uh-huh
g|and then when you get to the when you get below it go up towards your outlaws' hideout and sort of take the line sloping up so it's like going straight up towards the outlaws' hideout or it's going close to the hideout it's like you're so you're going to the other side of the page
f|it's right next to the lighthouse
g|right you uh-huh below the diamond mine
f|uh-huh
g|no do you have a gold mine
f|it's below pebbled shore to the left
g|yeah
f|okay
g|right you're going to go in a straight line along the left of the page okay
f|i went underneath burnt forest
g|and then go straight do you have a cattle stockade
f|should directly below me almost
g|so just do that
f|mm more or less yeah more or less
g|well just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact okay
f|that sounds a bit drastic right
g|underneath them
f|how unlucky
g|no not touching
f|so between the ghost town and sort of like a forty-five degree line or something
g|right don't go right right you can go a bit further about another inch
f|a pine grove
g|and then ehm eventually i want you to go round concealed hideout
f|east over the footbridge
g|between the cottage and the ravine
f|erm about an inch and a half
g|right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage can you do that
f|yes
g|right do you have ehm coconut palm to your left
f|uh-huh
g|okay
f|up past the lemon grove
g|ehm uh-huh yes more or less but don't go as far as that
f|mmhmm
g|come right to the page come right along and just go round the pyramid go round it and then under it so and then stop just at the just after you've been under the pyramid
f|okay
g|and below the graveyard below the graveyard but above the carved wooden pole
f|come up to the abandoned cottage skirted it
g|right and then sort of loop round a wee bit more don't don't draw your line in the same angle sort of make it a bit flatter and then draw another wee loop
f|uh-huh
g|ehm right do you know where go down about two inches okay
f|uh-huh
g|past the the shelter that's over the top
f|okay
g|okay erm
f|yes uh-huh
g|that's it
f|aye
g|well on my map to the right of burnt cottage there's a remote village okay
f|i bet they're totally different
g|a totem pole sort of thing
f|have you got the pine grove
g|you going to hit it
f|how do you mean go down
g|ah yeah and go up to the left of the north temple of the old temple go north to the left of the old temple
f|a pretend semicircle to the
g|yeah you're heading from the indian country to the gold mine but trying to avoid the gold rock so come down to the bottom of
f|to the east or the west
g|until you're just below the "a"
f|right okay
g|and then do you have an old temple
f|mm
g|i think you're on the wrong one
f|bottom right
g|to the to the left it's towards the "c" of crane bay
f|right i've got you
g|and go to your right
f|uh-huh
g|right so see when the nose comes out it comes back in to the face
f|and then that's the finish
g|just like just more a wee bit more than a straight line along past the diamond mine
f|right of the burnt forest
g|and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and and down about you know two and a half inches three inches
f|between them
g|yeah right round it uh-huh
f|uh-huh
g|ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
f|yeah
g|to the left of the fort and level with the base of the wooden pole but not actually beside the wooden pole
f|okay i don't have a forge anyway
g|to about halfway across the page
f|right
g|well i want you to follow follow the line of the the coast there so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there
f|yes
g|mm is that just right beneath it
f|right okay
g|no don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line
f|just north of the banana tree yeah
g|right okay come down come straight down to below that like a straight line down but take it to at least two inches below your outlaws' hideout not like you mean like straight down but like
f|ehm bypassing pebbled shore
g|and down the right-hand side
f|yeah it's right the way down below the manned fort have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the bottom
g|eh right um you're quite close to the mountain at the moment on its right-hand side
f|right got you
g|so that you're about in line with the bottom of the water
f|uh-huh
g|mmhmm
f|right there we go i've come right down below that
g|yeah above the rift valley you go above the rift valley and then you start coming down as in into the rift valley and you intersect like the line of the rift valley in the midpoint
f|aye
g|ehm you're coming the for three inches down below that do you have a diamond mine there
f|do i go to the side of the indian country
g|right well try and ehm go as close to ravine as possible but up towards the carved stones
f|i'm going north
g|well just draw in a diagonal to your left
f|okay
g|yeah if you just mm do you have a sort of the water coming down
f|okay
g|right turn round the old turn to the right after the old mill
f|always on my left
g|right starts above the stony desert
f|right
g|and then go back down to the side of it and underneath the bandit territory
f|yeah so i'm straight up i'm now at the top of the waterfall ehm not quite halfway up the page
g|mmhmm
f|i'll have to go through the forest
g|okay eh but going down at the same time so down about an inch and a half
f|ehm that's going to take me pretty near to the cactus thing so i'm trying to avoid that
g|but don't actually go near them
f|no no steps
g|do you have carved stones
f|yeah right
g|can you manage that
f|right so it'll be mmhmm

f|uh-huh
g|no it's to the right-hand side of the diamond mine on my map there's a graveyard right beside it okay
f|uh-huh
g|which you are you heading towards your left-hand edge of the map
f|ah but there's something in the road
g|uh-huh if you had a great rock as if you're going underneath it
