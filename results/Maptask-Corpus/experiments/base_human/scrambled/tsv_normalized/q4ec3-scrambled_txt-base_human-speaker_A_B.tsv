f:	it's aye but it's still to my left
g:	"yeah like right through the sort of midpoint like through the it's like a ""u"" and you're going right through the midpoint you want to be down into the ""u"" as though you were going if you know what i mean"
f:	right okay
g:	understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
