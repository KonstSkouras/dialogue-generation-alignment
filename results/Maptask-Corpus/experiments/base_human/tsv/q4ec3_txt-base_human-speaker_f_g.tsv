g:	right ehm you've got to take your line down from the start to just vertically to just to the left of burnt forest
f:	to the left of burnt forest
g:	mmhmm
f:	so it's not far down
g:	no it's a tiny bit okay and while you're doing that go in to your right a bit but it doesn't really matter okay ehm have you got a ravine
f:	yeah
g:	right take that same line still down vertically to the left of the ravine
f:	there's a cottage on my map
g:	well just draw round it
f:	the left of the ravine
g:	uh-huh is the cottage in the way there no
f:	it's next to the ravine
g:	well that's okay right now take that take the line is the cottage directly beside the ravine
f:	mmhmm right next to it
g:	is there a space between them yeah
f:	mmhmm
g:	right take the line and go to your right underneath the cottage can you do that
f:	no 'cause the ravine's on the right of the cottage
g:	yeah but i want you to draw up through between the cottage and the ravine
f:	and down through
g:	no up through go go down vertically until you're and draw underneath the cottage and then come up
f:	mmhmm
g:	between the cottage and the ravine
f:	i've just come down there
g:	you weren't meant to
f:	right
g:	okay right you went down past burnt forest
f:	i went underneath burnt forest
g:	well you weren't meant to
f:	well you said draw round the cottage
g:	okay right you're meant to come down from the start
f:	mmhmm
g:	vertically right past burnt forest
f:	mmhmm
g:	keep drawing vertically
f:	oh right down past the carpenter's cottage
g:	past the cottage
f:	and then go right
g:	then go right underneath the cottage
f:	uh-huh
g:	go up through between the cottage and the ravine 'til you get to stop just above the ravine
f:	uh-huh
g:	and do you have a remote village
f:	no
g:	well on my map to the right of burnt cottage there's a remote village okay
f:	right of the burnt forest
g:	uh-huh and that's just situated above the ravine
f:	uh-huh
g:	okay so i want you to imagine i want you to imagine that the remote village is there just to the right of the burnt forest right so it's kind of like in a triangle
f:	right
g:	so draw your line to the right horizontally above the ravine okay then do you have a pine forest
f:	a pine grove
g:	a pine grove uh-huh
f:	uh-huh
g:	i want you to draw the line keep going to your right okay so you're sort of like drawing towards the top of the pine grove then stop and go from left to right in a diagonal underneath the pine grove
f:	a diagonal
g:	from from the top of the ravine to underneath the pine grove
f:	so it's like diagonally down
g:	uh-huh okay and then do you have anything underneath pine grove
f:	avalanche

f:	down or
g:	can you go between the pine grove and the avalanche
f:	uh-huh
g:	to get past it yeah well draw that way
f:	down to the concealed hideout

f:	past the avalanche
g:	and then ehm eventually i want you to go round concealed hideout
f:	right
g:	okay
f:	what do you mean round

f:	yeah right of the concealed hideout uh-huh
g:	draw to just before the boat house writing starts there right okay that's where i want you to be
f:	what from the concealed hideout to the boat house
g:	uh-huh
f:	so would it bypass the river
g:	yeah i don't want you to go near the river at all
f:	but i have to go near it to go to the boat house
g:	no i want you to go to the boat house on your right on your on your left
f:	i don't have one on my left

f:	oh no mine's is underneath the concealed hideout
g:	have you drawn down to there
f:	no
g:	good right imagine you've got a boat house to the left of the concealed hideout right do you see where in can you see crane bay
f:	mmhmm
g:	do you see where there's where the coastline comes round it's um there's a sort of like jutting out bit there's like a point
f:	yeah
g:	just underneath concealed hideout
f:	mmhmm
g:	or just to the right of it okay i want you to you see where it comes down like that
f:	mmhmm
g:	well i want you to follow follow the line of the the coast there so draw from concealed hideout vertically downwards 'til you come to that jutting out bit of the coastline then until until on that incline draw you know follow the line of the coast but don't don't go on to crane bay until you come to the the next bit that comes up okay stop there
f:	mmhmm mmhmm
g:	right do you have ehm coconut palm to your left
f:	no
g:	no do you have pebbled shore
f:	mmhmm
g:	well i want you to draw uh i've got pebbled shore and above that i've got coconut palm
f:	mmhmm
g:	right so imagine you've got a tree there and i want you to draw between where that tree would be where the pebbled shore is so just keep drawing go make your line go down a bit right and just to come to above pebbled shore and just stop the end there and then ehm i don't suppose you've got finished marked on your map no right have you got anything below pebbled shore
f:	washed stones
g:	well
f:	and flagship and bay

g:	sort of see where that is right imagine the finish is there draw roughly down to there
f:	ehm bypassing pebbled shore
g:	it would be just just near mmhmm but you just right near the end of the page
f:	so i just go down to the right of pebbled shore
g:	yeah uh-huh
