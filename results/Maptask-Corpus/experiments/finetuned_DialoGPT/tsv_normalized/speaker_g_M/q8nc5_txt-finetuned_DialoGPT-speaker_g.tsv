M:	right
g:	right you're what you're going to do is you're going to curve to the right and then back left okay so that when you come you're going to be about three to four inches below directly below start
M:	mmhmm
g:	understand what i mean so it's not going to it's it's not going to be a straight line it's going to be a curve
M:	mmhmm

M:	right
g:	right okay so you're going to in a straight line go go to the right have you got the ravine
M:	uh-uh
g:	right going to go straight along ehm say about along to the right leaving about an inch about an inch from the ravine
M:	mmhmm so i'm going to curve up
g:	uh-huh then you're going to eh slope up to the right eh oh uh-huh to the left of the ravine you're going to slope up go above the top of the ravine

g:	uh-huh you can go about a centimetre above the the ravine okay and then
M:	right
g:	uh-huh uh-huh
M:	and you should be sort of like at the left-most tip
g:	and then you're going to go straight along to the right in a straight line
M:	right okay
g:	uh-huh okay so don't go as far as the pine grove
M:	right okay
g:	right so you should be about ehm level with the top of the pine grove that that far up
M:	mm
g:	but you're about you know you're not in near the you're not at the pine grove yet
M:	right i'm at the top
g:	so you're about an inch and a half from the pine grove you're going to your line is going to slope down to the right but you're going to keep to the left-hand side of the pine grove i'm not making this very easy am i right
M:	right okay
g:	see what i mean
M:	right
g:	so you go down until you're ehm 'til you're at the bottom left-hand corner of the pine grove
M:	right

M:	and then turn to your right
g:	right right have you got the concealed hideout
M:	yeah
g:	oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout
M:	yeah
g:	okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
M:	uh i'm going to go down to the left first then
g:	okay moving down all the time
M:	uh right
g:	you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're
M:	right okay
g:	uh-huh
M:	okay
g:	right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout
M:	so you're basically in a line with the end of the concealed out of it
g:	no
M:	right
g:	no
M:	right so i'm going down
g:	no you're going you're going to go to the right of the concealed hideout you're going to go along the top to the right
M:	right okay
g:	mmhmm
M:	and then you're just going up the side of it okay
g:	'til you've sort of curved to the right then to the left and then back out to the right again

M:	right
g:	right okay ehm right so you're where are you now then
M:	right
g:	okay right ehm have you got the boat house

g:	right okay sorry that's the wrong one you don't wanna go anywhere near that one right
M:	right i'll just go down there
g:	uh-huh just just scrub that bit out then and go back up to the concealed hideout

M:	mmhmm
g:	mmhmm
M:	and you're going to come up and you're just going to keep going up past the concealed out of the page
g:	right okay
M:	now if you move straight up the page until you're at just about level with the top of the white mountain that's your peak
