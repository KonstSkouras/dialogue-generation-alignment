M:	yeah
g:	you don't have a forge well the forge is eh below the the cliffs say about two inches down okay so you go from the start slightly to your right down the way right a curve
M:	mm right
g:	to the bottom of the cliffs
M:	uh i've got a forge about two and a half inches below the cliff what do you want me to do
g:	and then you start to go left go about half an inch out to the left and and down about you know two and a half inches three inches
M:	mmhmm
g:	an inch and a half if you draw that line down you'll be on the left-hand side of the forge you don't have a forge but there is one there
M:	right i'm on the right-hand
g:	so now you're about
M:	i've got a forge about two inches below the cliffs okay
g:	you should really end up about four inches down from the the cross er you know in the same line like just beneath it in fact four inches down okay
M:	right okay
g:	no no
M:	"right well i'll tell you what right you're under the ""t"" of cliffs"
g:	no the initial line from the cross
M:	right
g:	goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs
M:	oh right
g:	it goes down to where it says cliffs okay
M:	right
g:	about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're
M:	uh right okay
g:	yeah
M:	okay
g:	until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start
M:	right okay
g:	do you have an old pine
M:	yeah
g:	yeah a single old pine
M:	yeah okay
g:	and down down as far as that okay
M:	okay
g:	but you know beneath the start
M:	uh yeah
g:	so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
M:	so i go right underneath it
g:	over the pine
M:	yeah
g:	yeah more or less
M:	more or less yeah
g:	as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
M:	right
g:	worry too much about the exact
M:	well i've got a forge about two inches to the left of the pine so
g:	route but eh
M:	so i go down to the bottom of the pine grove
g:	right so once you're at the top of the pine if you go about two and a half inches three inches to the right have you got a pine forest
M:	uh-huh
g:	you have well just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	right
g:	you've got a bay there
M:	yes
g:	i don't have a bay there it'll be at the top
M:	right okay
g:	have you got a bay at the bottom
M:	uh i've got an apache camp it's it's below the apache
g:	crane bay
M:	yeah well head down past the centre of the map past the bottom of it
g:	where's the one at the top
M:	it's at the the top of the page right
g:	how far down
M:	about two centimetres
g:	yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	right
g:	okay once you're at the bottom of the pine forest just where it says pine
M:	right okay
g:	okay if you if you just kind of draw a draw an arc er to the right just more or less the same direction as you've been going until have you got wheatfields
M:	right okay
g:	on your map no well the
M:	yeah
g:	you have right
M:	yeah
g:	well just draw the arc and stop the arc you know in line with the wheatfields but beneath the pine forest okay
M:	mm
g:	oh two or three inches down from the pine forest okay you know it doesn't have to be an arc as long as you avoid all the obstacles i think eh if you you know if you finish up eh in line with the wheatfields okay but beneath the pine forest you if you stop drawing your line there above the bakery in other words above the eh
M:	right
g:	well er you know imagine where the forge would be on your map or it's it's on mine but imagine where it would be
M:	right
g:	about two inches down from that in in between the the forge and the old pine
M:	mm
g:	on the left-hand side okay so where are you now
M:	ehm about two inches to the right of the old temple
g:	mmhmm no no no
M:	right okay
g:	no don't worry about the wheatfields it's just to tell you where to stop the line
M:	right
g:	never mind about it being an arc or a curve or anything
M:	no no just straight down
g:	just just go down the left-hand side of the pine forest
M:	right
g:	okay and once you get to the where it says pine draw a line from there to eh above the bakery but not the chimney a bit to the left of that in fact the left-hand side it must be a wee shed or whatever it is
M:	right so i'm going down to the level of the bottom of the bakery
g:	you see what i
M:	!!!'!!!'!!there's a tree
g:	yeah but stop when you get just to above the bakery
M:	right okay right
g:	then just go round the bakery on the right-hand side just draw a an oval shape round the right-hand side of the bakery
M:	mmhmm
g:	yeah right round it uh-huh
M:	right
g:	underneath the bakery
M:	no
g:	have you got a canal
M:	no
g:	no well the canal is about two inches to the left-hand side of the bakery but it's in line with it so once you get an inch or and a half or so past the bakery
M:	right okay
g:	eh take your line down to crane bay oh i've got two wheatfields that's not important is it right anyway so you get to the canal right you don't have one but just go down about two inches until you get to crane bay and follow follow the curve okay of crane bay
M:	mm
g:	but not don't go down just go along don't go don't go down where it it really curves away there don't don't follow that
M:	right okay
g:	so you're at the top left-hand side of crane bay right just northwest of where it says crane
M:	right i'm just about at the left-most er there's about a half an inch to the right
g:	"or the where the ""c"" is"
M:	uh right
g:	i've got wheatfields in line with where it says bay okay about an inch or so to the left of crane bay itself just in line in fact beneath where the other wheatfields were that i that i was telling you about
M:	right
g:	okay so you go round the round that curve and you have to go down and about an inch and a half okay to to avoid the wheatfields which are just to the left of crane bay so you go down there right
M:	right
g:	go beneath the wheatfields in other words draw a line you know two inches or so to the left have you got a rocket warehouse
M:	uh-huh
g:	well just draw a line between well above the rocket warehouse in fact okay
M:	uh right
g:	an an inch or so above the rocket warehouse but to the left of it go round it the same way as you went round the igloo but on the other side okay just follow it round
M:	right
g:	go down the left-hand side of the page once you've done that
M:	uh right
g:	have you got a lighthouse
M:	uh a lighthouse no
g:	the rocket warehouse
M:	uh rocket warehouse uh-hope so
g:	the cross is right next to the lighthouse and just take your line to there and that's it finished
M:	right
g:	on the left-hand side of it
M:	uh well it's sort of on the right-hand but very slightly on the left
g:	well yeah that would be okay
M:	right
g:	uh-huh and just the cross is right you know the left-hand side of the lighthouse just next to it
M:	uh yeah
g:	okay got it
M:	you got a rocket warehouse
g:	right that's it finished
