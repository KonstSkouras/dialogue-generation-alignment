M:	mm
g:	go along to the the left
M:	mm
g:	there's no banana tree in this one
M:	right
g:	uh-huh well say the top's north and
M:	"!!!,!!'!!""!!!'!!226!!8!!147!!4!!7!!6!!987!!146!!424!!328!!488!!886!!286!!487!!288!!88!!688!!889!!84!!89!!92!!888!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!.!!'t!!86!!44!!"
g:	go west
M:	right okay
g:	until you've just got past the edge of the crest falls
M:	right okay
g:	"and then come down until you reach a an angle maybe just past south towards west slightly past until you reach the bottom of crest falls and a level with the ""c"" and maybe about an inch to west of the ""c"""
M:	mmhmm
g:	right and then go due west until about two centimetres from the edge of the paper
M:	mmhmm
g:	now do you have a footbridge
M:	yes
g:	right go up north now until you're just due north until you're just below the the level of the footbridge
M:	okay
g:	and then from there go over right to the edge of the the the western side of footbridge
M:	right
g:	right and then the path the path starts again at the other side of the footbridge now do you have a poisoned stream there
M:	no
g:	well just at the the footbridge next to when you come off there's a poisoned stream so when you come off the footbridge you have to go due south maybe about an inch and a half
M:	mm
g:	uh-huh and then och take a wee bit more to be safe just a wee touch more
M:	right right
g:	and then do you have an old temple
M:	yeah
g:	right go along eastward for about two inches
M:	okay
g:	and then curve up until you're at the bottom of the old temple
M:	mm
g:	mmhmm now go up about two and a half inches do you have anything above the old temple in that area up there
M:	"!!!'!!""!!226!!456!!228!!8!!84!!88!!889!!4!!888!!86!!886!!96!!92!!89!!98!!"
g:	right what about do you have an abandoned truck
M:	ehm no
g:	uh-huh
M:	right okay
g:	is there anything between the old temple and the truck
M:	there's a slate mountain
g:	right i don't have that
M:	okay so if you draw a line from the start
g:	go two and a half inches up over the temple the up the side of it
M:	right
g:	and then and then say an angle of northwest forty-five degrees
M:	mm
g:	go up for about two inches that would probably take you past the top of the
M:	mm
g:	something uh-huh
M:	yeah
g:	and then back down at the same angle to well the opposite angle anyway to get you down to your abandoned truck just below it
M:	right right so i'm going down
g:	and then go straight across the bottom of the abandoned truck
M:	right so i'm going round in a sort of curve
g:	"until you're just below the ""a"""
M:	right okay
g:	now have you got baboons
M:	no
g:	right now come due south
M:	mmhmm
g:	about an inch and a half to an inch and three quarters
M:	yeah right
g:	and then due west for about two inches uh then
M:	right
g:	do you have a white mountain further up
M:	yes
g:	"right now well the best thing to do first of all would be come back up to where you were at the ""a"" and the come up to make that a ""u"" shape"
M:	right okay
g:	and then draw a line straight between this point and maybe about half a centimetre to the west of the bottom of the white mountain
M:	right
g:	right now mm go up the side of the mountain until you're maybe follow the side for up until about half an inch below the summit
M:	mm
g:	and then change to going due north for about three inches
M:	mm
g:	ah there's no lemon grove in this one
M:	well go to the right until you get to the top of the lemon ave
g:	right is there a pyramid
M:	"!!!'!!!'!!""!!2015!!2014!!224!!226!! 226!!4!!8!!81!!84!!86!!88!!92!!7!!85!!89!!!.!!!,!!.!!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!"
g:	yeah now this'll be you just about a third of the way up the pyramid
M:	uh-huh
g:	and then straight across until about a centimetre to the west of the pyramid
M:	okay
g:	no straight across until
M:	until i'm directly below the left-hand edge of the page
g:	on the same level
M:	"!!! rem!!okay!!!.!!'!!!'!!""!!226!!456!!4!!72!!8!!88!!7!!91!!6!!74!!754!!775!!92!!81!!84!!886!!86!!83!!!!!!!.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
g:	and then mm go up over the top of the pyramid and in a a cone sort of a a triangle shape and down the other side until you're at the base of the pyramid
M:	mmhmm
g:	right do you have a cobbled street
M:	no
g:	right below the pyramid there's a cobbled street and
M:	i've got a pyramid
g:	ehm it's below the western side of the pyramid
M:	uh-huh
g:	"now from where you are just now draw a curved line 'til you're below the ""d"" of pyramid"
M:	"mmhmm so i'm going to go down to the bottom of the ""b"""
g:	and then straight across until you're just below the point of the pyramid at the western tip
M:	right okay
g:	right go at an angle slightly more slightly to the west of south
M:	mmhmm
g:	to avoid the cobbled street there and do you have a remote village
M:	yeah
g:	and just to where the the thick lines at the remote village drawing are
M:	uh-huh
g:	just about a centimetre to the west of the thick line and stop there
M:	right
g:	"now curve round draw a curve until you're below the ""r"" of remote"
M:	mmhmm
g:	"and then straight across until you're below the ""e"""
M:	right right
g:	"the ""e"" in village sorry"
M:	"!!!'!!""!! bolshevik!! bolshe!!'t!!lenin!! lenin!!,!!r!!8!!4!!"
g:	and then go straight across another inch and that's the finish
M:	straight across
