f:	am i going above or below here at the moment i'm at at the moment i'm just slightly to the left of the rocks
M:	well take your curve right round the white water so that you're coming down and then you go down
f:	so where's where do i go from there
M:	right you're going from the left-hand side of the rapids to the right-hand edge of the white water
f:	taking it round from the top or
M:	no no just straight up the side of the white i mean you should be round the side where the the the whitewashed cottage is and then you go straight up and then back down the other side of it
f:	right okay right so i'm now at the top left-hand corner of the rapids
M:	uh-huh
f:	oh i see what you mean yeah
M:	you see what i mean
f:	have you got a manned fort below the rapids
M:	no
f:	'cause i've got that interrupting er like almost directly below it slightly to the left i've got a manned fort
M:	well i've not got that so you need to go round it
f:	eh oh right
M:	you've got stone creek and then below that you've got an outlaws' hideout
f:	yeah it's right the way down below the manned fort have you not got anything in between the rapids and the stone creek down at the bottom
M:	no i've not no i've gone i've went down past the manned
f:	yeah no in right in between the two of those i've got a manned fort
M:	right well go right up to them and round them
f:	er about two inches maybe two and a half
M:	right
f:	the stone creek and the stone slabs
M:	stone slabs yeah
f:	which way do you want me to go round the left or the right-hand side of that
M:	go go down so you're on the left of the stone creek that way you're going down you know to underneath the stone circle
f:	right okay
M:	"!!!'!!""!!2016!! 2016!!8!!84!!88!!4!!886!!89!!286!!487!!488!!889!!911!!!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!.!!.!! remind me!!mm!!u!!i!!'t!!right!!you!!yeah!!okay!!r!!oh!!there!!god!!and!!until you!!!'!!===!!"
f:	right so it's a diagonal across the page towards that
M:	yeah that's right yeah
f:	that sounds a bit drastic right
M:	right i'm going to go down and then round the top of the manned fort then
f:	yeah have you got a gold mine there as well just
M:	i have a gold like a mine between my outlaws hideout and the noose so
f:	just to below and to the right of the outlaws' hideout i've got a gold mine
M:	"!!!'!!!'!!""!!"
f:	i'm going to be quite wealthy i've got all the mines
M:	right so you're going to go up and then you're sloping to the left
f:	erm no
M:	"!!!'!!!'!!""!!2!!8!!4!!7!!6!!8000!!88!!886!!888!!889!!!.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!!!--!!'t!!u!!.!!"
f:	er i've got a saloon bar right down on the left-hand side
M:	right
f:	short cut yeah
M:	right
f:	mmhmm i'm well i've got it at the moment i'm slightly below it but
M:	right and then you go along the top of the page to the right and then
f:	yeah
M:	you want to go you want to keep the gold mine on your left-hand side
f:	"not directly below it just just below the ""u"" if you take it down from the hideout er that that's just that's just at the left-hand side"
M:	yeah just below it right
f:	but are your stone slabs not kind of at the other side of that
M:	i've got rapids
f:	'cause my stone slabs are like maybe what two and a half inches below and to the left
M:	yeah so if you just take a line right round the bottom of the abandoned cottage
f:	the gold mine is
M:	right okay
f:	mm aye directly above the noose that's a better description
M:	"!!!'!!,!!!'!!226!!""!! bolshevik!!"
f:	on its right-hand side
M:	uh-huh
f:	so that's like towards the edge of the paper here
M:	mmhmm
f:	right there we go i've come right down below that
M:	right
f:	i've got the saloon bar and i've got the stone creek directly across to the left of the noose er but i've got nothing else in that area at all
M:	so have you got anything to the right of the saloons
f:	you know like below that i should say i mean in the in the middle and to above them and the stone slabs
M:	uh yeah
f:	mmhmm
M:	right
f:	right so i've to avoid that
M:	and then i go along to the left
f:	so go above it
M:	above it
f:	phoar
M:	right
f:	that's it yeah
M:	right okay
f:	what the first bit of that was a total disaster
M:	right
f:	'cause i came through the rift valley the wrong way i was supposed to come from the top and go down 'til like down through it
M:	okay
f:	'cause i well i came from underneath don't know what i was doing down there
