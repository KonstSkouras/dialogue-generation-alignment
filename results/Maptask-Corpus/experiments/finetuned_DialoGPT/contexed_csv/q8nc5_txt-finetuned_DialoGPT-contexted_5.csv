60,yeah,oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout,uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though,right right have you got the concealed hideout,uh-huh,okay
61,well you want to go up to the concealed out round the concealedout,uh-huh,oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout,uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though,right right have you got the concealed hideout,uh-huh
62,uh i'm going to go down to the left first then,okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right,uh-huh,oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout,uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though,right right have you got the concealed hideout
63,and then you're kind of curving back up so you're sort of going vertically downwards,mmhmm,okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right,uh-huh,oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout,uh-huh i've got an avalanche above it though
64,uh right,okay moving down all the time,mmhmm,okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right,uh-huh,oh right okay ehm directly above the concealed hideout
65,well i don't know i donae understand what way,along what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it,okay moving down all the time,mmhmm,okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right,uh-huh
66,right okay,you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're,along what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it,okay moving down all the time,mmhmm,okay well i haven't got that but what you what you're going to do is you're going to right you've got we've got another curve on the line so this is probably why you're curving to avoid that avalanche so you curve first of all to the right
67,uh-huh towards the concealed out of the line,towards the concealed hideout,you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're,along what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it,okay moving down all the time,mmhmm

69,you go you go round it just draw a wee cross,where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout,uh-huh,towards the concealed hideout,you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're,along what along the bottom of the pine grove or going past it
70,so you're basically in a line with the end of the concealed out of it,right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout,where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout,uh-huh,towards the concealed hideout,you're just you're just you're going down but also to the right you're you're
71,no,but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove,right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout,where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout,uh-huh,towards the concealed hideout
72,right,no,but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove,right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout,where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout,uh-huh
73,no not much,so it's not much of a curve,no,but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove,right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout,where do i end up in relation to the concealed hideout
74,right so i'm going down,no,so it's not much of a curve,no,but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove,right what happens is you go you curve to the right and then back into the left and then you curve to the right again along the top of this concealed hideout
75,uh-huh that's right that's good right and then you go down,right eh and i end up to the left of the concealed hideout,no,so it's not much of a curve,no,but i i don't go along the bottom of the pine grove
