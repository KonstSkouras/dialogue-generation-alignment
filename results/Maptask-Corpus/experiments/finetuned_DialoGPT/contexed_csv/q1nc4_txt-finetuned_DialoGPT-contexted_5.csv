18,oh right,goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs,mmhmm,no the initial line from the cross,no,no no
19,and then you're going to do a forty-five degree line straight down at forty-f degrees,right okay,goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs,mmhmm,no the initial line from the cross,no
20,right,it goes down to where it says cliffs okay,right okay,goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs,mmhmm,no the initial line from the cross
21,right,uh-huh,it goes down to where it says cliffs okay,right okay,goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs,mmhmm
22,uh right okay,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're,uh-huh,it goes down to where it says cliffs okay,right okay,goes right but it doesn't go as far right as the cliffs
23,uh just slightly underneath the start yeah,right straight down under the start,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're,uh-huh,it goes down to where it says cliffs okay,right okay
24,okay,yeah,right straight down under the start,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're,uh-huh,it goes down to where it says cliffs okay
25,right and then you've got a forge about an inch below the cliffs okay,right,yeah,right straight down under the start,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're,uh-huh
26,right okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start,right,yeah,right straight down under the start,about a centimetre from where it says cliffs to the left-hand side of it okay then you go back left slightly until you're beneath the the start and down you know two or three inches until you're
27,and then go straight down about three inches,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start,right,yeah,right straight down under the start
28,yeah,do you have an old pine,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start,right,yeah
29,right,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start,right
30,yeah okay,yeah a single old pine,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine,okay,until you're about you know four inches or four and a half inches or so down from the start
31,right okay,uh-huh,yeah a single old pine,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine,okay
32,okay,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh,yeah a single old pine,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit,do you have an old pine
33,and then curve round the top of it,right,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh,yeah a single old pine,uh-huh in the right kind of towards the middle a bit
34,uh yeah,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh,yeah a single old pine
35,right i'm there,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay,uh-huh
36,so i go right underneath it,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right,and down down as far as that okay
37,yeah,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start,right
38,yeah,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh,but you know beneath the start
39,right okay,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay,uh-huh
40,more or less yeah,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine,so then you go right which would be under the forge and you go up over the old pine okay
41,right,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine,right right up over the pine
42,right,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine,over the pine
43,so you're going like diagonally down towards the pine grove,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less,and i go right as far as the pine
44,well i've got a forge about two inches to the left of the pine so,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean,yeah more or less
45,ok,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to,if you see what i mean
46,so i go down to the bottom of the pine grove,route but eh,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact,oh,as as long as you avoid the forge and the pine you you don't have to
47,to the left-hand side of the fallen cairn,right up,route but eh,okay i don't have a forge anyway,worry too much about the exact,oh

61,uh right okay right,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top,uh-huh,crane bay,yeah
62,about two centimetres,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top,uh-huh,crane bay
63,right,erm about an inch and a half,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top,uh-huh
64,right,yeah well don't go much you know don't go any higher than than the the height of the old pine or or the forest that must be where the bay is i don't have a bay there but the route you know must miss the bay er so you know just go along 'til you get to the pine forest more or less and then go go down on the left-hand side of the pine forest,erm about an inch and a half,how far down,it's just in the centre of the page at the top very top,where's the one at the top
