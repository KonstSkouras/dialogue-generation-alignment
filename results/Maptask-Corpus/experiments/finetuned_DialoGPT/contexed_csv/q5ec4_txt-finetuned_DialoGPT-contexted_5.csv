91,and then you go down and there's a sort of a bit you go along and you go right down and underneath the letters of the letters where they say warehouse,right okay,uh-huh,around the top of the rocket warehouse,right sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse,yes
92,okay,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page,right okay,uh-huh,around the top of the rocket warehouse,right sort of don't go vertically down it but start sloping down towards around the top of the rocket warehouse
93,yeah until you're about a centimetre and a half from the edge of the paper,right out to the side of the page,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page,right okay,uh-huh,around the top of the rocket warehouse
94,okay,uh-huh,right out to the side of the page,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page,right okay,uh-huh
95,and now you want to go ehm to your left,right,uh-huh,right out to the side of the page,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page,right okay
96,yeah i've got it yeah,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right,uh-huh,right out to the side of the page,and then slope the line right out to the side of the page
97,right so if you could take a line up to about the middle of the east lake,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right,uh-huh,right out to the side of the page
98,uh-uh yeah,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right,uh-huh
99,yeah about a,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that,right
100,uh-huh,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page,oh aye near enough,no but like see where your line is at the side of the page is that at rocket like where the words rocket are written,no i'm past the rocket,the outside of the page and then eh sort of draw a are you about in line with the rocket bit or have you done that

104,right ehm go round the cave ehm round the side where the two bits meet and go to the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page,right so we just like take the line down vertically down the side of the page
105,uh-huh well go up above the cave in a circle sort of thing you know just curve round it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres,down the side of the page
106,no i'm going to go straight down,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right,for about two centimetres
107,right okay right,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave,right
108,right okay,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse,and then curve it back in towards the old light house don't have a cave
109,right,and go past down below the cave,okay,yes if i go in so i'll come down further than the two centimetres,you going to hit it,past the cave well there's a cave in between the rocket warehouse and the old lighthouse
