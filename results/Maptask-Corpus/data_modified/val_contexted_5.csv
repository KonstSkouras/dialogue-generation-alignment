586,hot springs,ehm do you see the hot wells,right,ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left,right,no ehm never mind ehm once you get to the side of the head up the left-hand side of the savannah about four inches
587,hot springs yeah,hot springs,ehm do you see the hot wells,right,ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left,right
588,aye,hot springs yeah,hot springs,ehm do you see the hot wells,right,ehm now about an inch and a half back to the left
589,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of if you slope towards the bottom in a uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line,aye,hot springs yeah,hot springs,ehm do you see the hot wells,right
590,aye right right,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of if you slope towards the bottom in a uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line,aye,hot springs yeah,hot springs,ehm do you see the hot wells
591,right and now go to the left about an inch just so that you're going under the hot wells,aye right right,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of if you slope towards the bottom in a uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line,aye,hot springs yeah,hot springs
592,right,right and now go to the left about an inch just so that you're going under the hot wells,aye right right,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of if you slope towards the bottom in a uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line,aye,hot springs yeah
593,then another sort of diagonal slope downwards but ehm slightly steeper than forty-five degree line forty-five degrees for about an inch,right,right and now go to the left about an inch just so that you're going under the hot wells,aye right right,ehm from from where you are at the moment to about the bottom of the hot springs in a sort of if you slope towards the bottom in a uh the middle halfway you know underneath the middle of them about like a forty-five degree line,aye

830,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way,okay so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far,you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints,oh i've only got one that's not fair how far do i walk from where,yeah yeah i've actually got two great viewpoints,mmhmm have you got a great viewpoint
831,well it's about sort of four inches up,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way,okay so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far,you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints,oh i've only got one that's not fair how far do i walk from where,yeah yeah i've actually got two great viewpoints
832,four inches up and slightly to the left,well it's about sort of four inches up,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way,okay so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far,you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints,oh i've only got one that's not fair how far do i walk from where
833,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards,four inches up and slightly to the left,well it's about sort of four inches up,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way,okay so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far,you can have my map if you want two i'm i'm not very keen on great viewpoints
834,uh-huh,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards,four inches up and slightly to the left,well it's about sort of four inches up,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way,okay so do i go near the great viewpoint or not very far
835,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the,uh-huh,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards,four inches up and slightly to the left,well it's about sort of four inches up,um ah so the great viewpoint's in the way
836,where are you at the moment,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the,uh-huh,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards,four inches up and slightly to the left,well it's about sort of four inches up
837,above the stile,where are you at the moment,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the,uh-huh,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards,four inches up and slightly to the left
838,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route,above the stile,where are you at the moment,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the,uh-huh,well very very slightly are we going to go to this tree afterwards
839,bump like a like a hill,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route,above the stile,where are you at the moment,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the,uh-huh
840,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose,bump like a like a hill,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route,above the stile,where are you at the moment,well can i not go straight down because otherwise i'll have to go over the
841,yeah okay so,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose,bump like a like a hill,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route,above the stile,where are you at the moment
842,what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map,yeah okay so,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose,bump like a like a hill,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route,above the stile
843,okay i'll go right i've gone i've gone further up,what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map,yeah okay so,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose,bump like a like a hill,above the stile on this map there's a a sort of a bump basically in in the route
844,right now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree,okay i'll go right i've gone i've gone further up,what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map,yeah okay so,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose,bump like a like a hill
845,right to the tree yay,right now move right and down in a sort of circular sweep until you get to the dead tree,okay i'll go right i've gone i've gone further up,what i mean by that is there's a bump in the route there isn't a bump on the map,yeah okay so,yeah no no no well like a hill except yeah i suppose

1102,just stop above the farmer's gate,right and where where should i end up,yeah,so that's quite a small space is it i i presume,yeah,so i go between the the circle the stone circle and the gate then
1103,right directly above it,just stop above the farmer's gate,right and where where should i end up,yeah,so that's quite a small space is it i i presume,yeah
1104,yeah,right directly above it,just stop above the farmer's gate,right and where where should i end up,yeah,so that's quite a small space is it i i presume
1105,right,yeah,right directly above it,just stop above the farmer's gate,right and where where should i end up,yeah
1106,you there,right,yeah,right directly above it,just stop above the farmer's gate,right and where where should i end up
1107,uh-huh straight above it,you there,right,yeah,right directly above it,just stop above the farmer's gate
1108,right now do you have the meadow,uh-huh straight above it,you there,right,yeah,right directly above it
1109,yeah i do on the bottom bottom right,right now do you have the meadow,uh-huh straight above it,you there,right,yeah

1113,uh-huh,you just ignore that completely right,uh-huh,right well,yeah i do on the bottom bottom right,right now do you have the meadow
1114,what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow,uh-huh,you just ignore that completely right,uh-huh,right well,yeah i do on the bottom bottom right
1115,right so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow,what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow,uh-huh,you just ignore that completely right,uh-huh,right well
1116,yeah,right so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow,what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow,uh-huh,you just ignore that completely right,uh-huh

1118,right have you got what have you got the lake,right,yeah,right so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow,what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow,uh-huh
1119,no,right have you got what have you got the lake,right,yeah,right so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow,what do well basically you go up sort of a very slight diagonal line until you're above the meadow
1120,no,no,right have you got what have you got the lake,right,yeah,right so it's just a sort of very small gradient above the meadow
1121,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow,no,no,right have you got what have you got the lake,right,yeah
1122,i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow,no,no,right have you got what have you got the lake,right
1123,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation",i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow,no,no,right have you got what have you got the lake
1124,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation",i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow,no,no
1125,oh where's your map say to go,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation",i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow,no
1126,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards,oh where's your map say to go,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation",i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation,i'm i'm at the moment i'm underneath overnight accommodation and just almost in the i'm just in the beginning of the meadow
1127,oh right i see,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards,oh where's your map say to go,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation",i don't have that i don't have overnight accommodation
1128,at that point,oh right i see,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards,oh where's your map say to go,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there,"right well that's just eh if you take the the left of the meadow and go straight up to eh then the overnight accommodation is straight up from the left of the meadow and it's just slightly above the well it's actually in a line with the start writing if you put a wee ""x"" there for overnight accommodation"
1129,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then,at that point,oh right i see,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards,oh where's your map say to go,yeah well that's that'll be that's probably where you should go then if that's overnight accommodation probably want go there
1130,yeah,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then,at that point,oh right i see,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards,oh where's your map say to go
1131,where's it head after that,yeah,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then,at that point,oh right i see,it doesn't say go anywhere it just it turns turns northwards
1132,right well it goes,where's it head after that,yeah,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then,at that point,oh right i see
1133,i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest,right well it goes,where's it head after that,yeah,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then,at that point
1134,it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery,i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest,right well it goes,where's it head after that,yeah,so i so it's going to overnight accommodation then
1135,right right well i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah,it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery,i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest,right well it goes,where's it head after that,yeah
1136,oh where how is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow,right right well i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah,it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery,i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest,right well it goes,where's it head after that
1137,it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow,oh where how is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow,right right well i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah,it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery,i'll just just tell briefly and then i'll go to overnight accommodation we'll start again just sort of point of interest,right well it goes

1139,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there,right,it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow,oh where how is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow,right right well i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah,it goes up for it goes up for about ten ten or twelve centimetres it it goes round the north of the the ruined monastery
1140,yeah just above the wee birds,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there,right,it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow,oh where how is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow,right right well i'll i'll move into overnight accommodation and it just goes straight up from where i say overnight accommodation would be just right up northwards yeah
1141,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh,yeah just above the wee birds,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there,right,it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow,oh where how is it is your overnight accommodation directly above the meadow
1142,right that's right i know where you are,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh,yeah just above the wee birds,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there,right,it's the middle of of it's a wee a wee house the middle of it is straight up from the meadow
1143,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing,right that's right i know where you are,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh,yeah just above the wee birds,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there,right
1144,right that's it,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing,right that's right i know where you are,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh,yeah just above the wee birds,on the left of the meadow the the far left the meadow straight up from there
1145,so,right that's it,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing,right that's right i know where you are,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh,yeah just above the wee birds
1146,right that's that's where on my map is,so,right that's it,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing,right that's right i know where you are,yeah above the wee birds uh-huh
1147,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there,right that's that's where on my map is,so,right that's it,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing,right that's right i know where you are
1148,uh-huh,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there,right that's that's where on my map is,so,right that's it,and sight and eh the start of it is straight across from the start writing
1149,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side,uh-huh,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there,right that's that's where on my map is,so,right that's it
1150,oh have you got the ruined monastery,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side,uh-huh,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there,right that's that's where on my map is,so
1151,yeah the ruined monastery's,oh have you got the ruined monastery,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side,uh-huh,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there,right that's that's where on my map is
1152,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left,yeah the ruined monastery's,oh have you got the ruined monastery,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side,uh-huh,uh-huh so i just want to go up from there
1153,sort of,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left,yeah the ruined monastery's,oh have you got the ruined monastery,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side,uh-huh
1154,but then stop once you're at the left side of it right,sort of,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left,yeah the ruined monastery's,oh have you got the ruined monastery,which side of the ruined monastery should i sort of be coming out at the right side
1155,right right so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the left,but then stop once you're at the left side of it right,sort of,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left,yeah the ruined monastery's,oh have you got the ruined monastery
1156,yeah,right right so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the left,but then stop once you're at the left side of it right,sort of,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left,yeah the ruined monastery's
1157,and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand side,yeah,right right so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the left,but then stop once you're at the left side of it right,sort of,right you should go up the right side and over over the top and down the left
1158,just yeah just about there,and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand side,yeah,right right so i go straight up round to the right over the top and down by the left,but then stop once you're at the left side of it right,sort of

1161,uh-huh,are you,right right i'm there,just yeah just about there,and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand side,yeah
1162,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that,uh-huh,are you,right right i'm there,just yeah just about there,and how far down so i'm just sort of where the writing is on the left-hand side
1163,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that,uh-huh,are you,right right i'm there,just yeah just about there
1164,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that,uh-huh,are you,right right i'm there
1165,uh-huh,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that,uh-huh,are you
1166,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in,uh-huh,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that,uh-huh
1167,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in,uh-huh,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake,right we go eh left right along 'cause there's a lake just underneath that there's west lake have you got that
1168,well it's it's sort of,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in,uh-huh,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing,no i've only got east lake i've not got west lake
1169,what's this,well it's it's sort of,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in,uh-huh,right west lake is between the start and where you are and it's sort of a big circle and it's the eh the the top of it's just just very just underneath the ruined monastery writing
1170,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle,what's this,well it's it's sort of,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in,uh-huh
1171,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle,what's this,well it's it's sort of,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it,so it's just a sort of big circle so if you draw that in
1172,yeah,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle,what's this,well it's it's sort of,right it starts just under the ruined monastery it goes to the start and now what is it
1173,uh-huh,yeah,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle,what's this,well it's it's sort of
1174,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway,uh-huh,yeah,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle,what's this
1175,right right okay,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway,uh-huh,yeah,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say,it's above the start whereas the what is it it's a sort of eh how can i describe the shape it go so straight along the top straight straight down the right-hand side right just along a wee bit then a diagonal line up so it's like a triangle you could join the bottom of the lake with the start and the and the left-hand side of it to make a triangle
1176,right,right right okay,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway,uh-huh,yeah,you join the the bottom oh see i've not got the bottom lake the bottom lake's the start you say
1177,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery,right,right right okay,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway,uh-huh,yeah
1178,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery,right,right right okay,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway,uh-huh
1179,i've got a,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery,right,right right okay,but it doesn't go right the way along to the start it stops about halfway
1180,a line along the top,i've got a,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery,right,right right okay
1181,a line right a straight line along the top,a line along the top,i've got a,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery,right
1182,right,a line right a straight line along the top,a line along the top,i've got a,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn,i've got that roughly and where's the next point in the triangle just under the ruined monastery
1183,from from where i am sort of thing,right,a line right a straight line along the top,a line along the top,i've got a,eh no wait a minute what have you drawn
1184,yeah,from from where i am sort of thing,right,a line right a straight line along the top,a line along the top,i've got a
1185,right,yeah,from from where i am sort of thing,right,a line right a straight line along the top,a line along the top
1186,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight,right,yeah,from from where i am sort of thing,right,a line right a straight line along the top
1187,oh right uh-huh right i've got that,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight,right,yeah,from from where i am sort of thing,right
1188,then straight line down the right-hand side,oh right uh-huh right i've got that,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight,right,yeah,from from where i am sort of thing
1189,eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or what,then straight line down the right-hand side,oh right uh-huh right i've got that,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight,right,yeah
1190,eh it's going down towards the start,eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or what,then straight line down the right-hand side,oh right uh-huh right i've got that,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight,right
1191,right straight down or sort of diagonally down towards it,eh it's going down towards the start,eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or what,then straight line down the right-hand side,oh right uh-huh right i've got that,it's not really straight but it's but it's easier to draw it straight
1192,sort of straight down,right straight down or sort of diagonally down towards it,eh it's going down towards the start,eh to just the start bit down from down from where where's it start going down from the stile or from the start or what,then straight line down the right-hand side,oh right uh-huh right i've got that
