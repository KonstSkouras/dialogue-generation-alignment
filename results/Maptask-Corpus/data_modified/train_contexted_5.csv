497,it's an old mill,the mill wheel,no right okay we're going see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map,do i go past the picket fence,and then across about two and go back up in,right
498,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing,it's an old mill,the mill wheel,no right okay we're going see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map,do i go past the picket fence,and then across about two and go back up in
499,okay right,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing,it's an old mill,the mill wheel,no right okay we're going see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map,do i go past the picket fence
500,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence,okay right,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing,it's an old mill,the mill wheel,no right okay we're going see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map
501,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence,okay right,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing,it's an old mill,the mill wheel
502,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence,okay right,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing,it's an old mill
503,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence,okay right,i don't have an old mill it says mill wheel must be the same thing
504,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence,okay right
505,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh,so i go down from the caravan park turn right before the picket fence
506,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it,you go to the old mill there's no picket fence here eh
507,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park,you don't have a picket i've a i've got a picket fence about three inches down from the caravan park so i need to stop short of that and turn right right and go and pass beneath the mill wheel or the old the old mill as you have it
508,where's your actually go to it well,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine,well no i go down and then i turn right no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park
509,mmhmm,where's your actually go to it well,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence,yeah it's about i mean maybe an inch and a half or two inches southeast of it on mine
510,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing,mmhmm,where's your actually go to it well,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence,mm and have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the you've not to pass that fence
511,hmm but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing,mmhmm,where's your actually go to it well,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first,well if i went three inches down from the caravan park i would you know i'd more or less hit the picket fence
512,where well i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it on the map beneath it on the map,hmm but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing,mmhmm,where's your actually go to it well,so then right i see so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first
513,right okay mmhmm,where well i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it on the map beneath it on the map,hmm but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing,mmhmm,where's your actually go to it well
514,you know so i can go down and then to the right and and you know another couple of inches and that's me below the mill wheel,right okay mmhmm,where well i you i don't suppose you you you can go outside the picket fence eh i i could i could go down about you know two and a half inches and then go right and that would take me underneath my mill wheel right you know beneath it so that not not beneath it on the map beneath it on the map,hmm but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first,i you know i wouldn't have to really go down i could just i could just go you know down and to the right rather than go down and then turn right sort of thing,mmhmm

661,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,why it's just a fence,well do you not have to go round it,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but,uh-huh uh-huh,i don't think so that that's what we did first of all the the the first line
662,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,why it's just a fence,well do you not have to go round it,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but,uh-huh uh-huh
663,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,why it's just a fence,well do you not have to go round it,when i was asking you whether i could you know i had to eh stop before i got to the picket fence or not so but
664,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,why it's just a fence,well do you not have to go round it
665,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely,why it's just a fence
666,i'm above the chimney just now,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence,it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely
667,right you're above the chimney and if you start going in an angle about forty-five degrees down,i'm above the chimney just now,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know,you think so maybe it's the the route's to stay inside the picket fence
668,mm mmhmm,right you're above the chimney and if you start going in an angle about forty-five degrees down,i'm above the chimney just now,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there,well maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know
669,to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottage right,mm mmhmm,right you're above the chimney and if you start going in an angle about forty-five degrees down,i'm above the chimney just now,right right you went by the abandoned cottage right,i've got one i've got one i don't know realise why it's there

731,right,no from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake,up from its furthest point,yeah,is it,the golf course is just beneath the east lake about an inch or so down
732,there's a golf course it's not that big,right,no from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake,up from its furthest point,yeah,is it
733,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think,there's a golf course it's not that big,right,no from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake,up from its furthest point,yeah
734,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think,there's a golf course it's not that big,right,no from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake,up from its furthest point
735,right,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think,there's a golf course it's not that big,right,no from eh okay it's about two inches down from where it says east lake in the lake
736,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top,right,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think,there's a golf course it's not that big,right
737,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top,right,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think,there's a golf course it's not that big
738,they must be,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top,right,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so,so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think
739,right,they must be,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top,right,well let's get round the lake first the west lake so
740,towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it,right,they must be,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top,right
741,right west lake isn't you don't want to cross the lake,towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it,right,they must be,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then,i mean then then that's how i i'd need to go right round the top
742,but how am i going to get to the farmland or or anything else,right west lake isn't you don't want to cross the lake,towards the top of the page unless i cross unless i cross the lake i'd need to go right round it,right,they must be,i take it they're the same shape on the maps then

757,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake,mmhmm,and you've gone straight up,mmhmm,right you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right,mmhmm
758,mmhmm oh i didn't actually i didn't actually go there,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake,mmhmm,and you've gone straight up,mmhmm,right you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right
759,"see the see see west lake see where the ""e"" is",mmhmm oh i didn't actually i didn't actually go there,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake,mmhmm,and you've gone straight up,mmhmm
760,yeah mmhmm,"see the see see west lake see where the ""e"" is",mmhmm oh i didn't actually i didn't actually go there,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake,mmhmm,and you've gone straight up
761,directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded,yeah mmhmm,"see the see see west lake see where the ""e"" is",mmhmm oh i didn't actually i didn't actually go there,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake,mmhmm
762,yeah i know the i know the bit the bottom right-hand side this is you're talking about,directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded,yeah mmhmm,"see the see see west lake see where the ""e"" is",mmhmm oh i didn't actually i didn't actually go there,to the bottom of west lake see directly underneath it where it says west lake

856,what bit of east lake do i go up to,uh-huh,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course,and then go straight up towards the east lake,right,go left
857,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve,what bit of east lake do i go up to,uh-huh,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course,and then go straight up towards the east lake,right
858,i can imagine see where the see where the,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve,what bit of east lake do i go up to,uh-huh,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course,and then go straight up towards the east lake
859,nuclear test site is,i can imagine see where the see where the,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve,what bit of east lake do i go up to,uh-huh,so i go left along the left-hand side of the golf course
860,the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know,nuclear test site is,i can imagine see where the see where the,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve,what bit of east lake do i go up to,uh-huh
861,to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake,the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know,nuclear test site is,i can imagine see where the see where the,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve,what bit of east lake do i go up to
862,i can't yeah at the bottom i can't go any further left sorry further right than that because i've been i i'd need to go through the golf course so i've actually you know that's where i am now more or less beneath that point because that's the like the,to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake,the the left-hand side of the east lake at the bottom right if you draw a straight line down there that's the edge of the golf course so i can't go any i can't you know,nuclear test site is,i can imagine see where the see where the,just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve

868,so i just go from there now,uh-huh,at the bottom,uh-huh,at at the left-hand side,but that's where you're meant to end up underneath east lake
869,no that's the finish,so i just go from there now,uh-huh,at the bottom,uh-huh,at at the left-hand side
870,yeah i,no that's the finish,so i just go from there now,uh-huh,at the bottom,uh-huh
871,do you know where the farmed land is,yeah i,no that's the finish,so i just go from there now,uh-huh,at the bottom
872,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake,do you know where the farmed land is,yeah i,no that's the finish,so i just go from there now,uh-huh
873,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake,do you know where the farmed land is,yeah i,no that's the finish,so i just go from there now
874,mmhmm right okay,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake,do you know where the farmed land is,yeah i,no that's the finish
875,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument,mmhmm right okay,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake,do you know where the farmed land is,yeah i
876,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument,mmhmm right okay,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake,do you know where the farmed land is
877,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument,mmhmm right okay,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake,yeah the farmed land's between east and west lake
878,i've not done that yet,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument,mmhmm right okay,yeah you go well your finish point's just beside east lake
879,see where east lake is,i've not done that yet,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument,mmhmm right okay
880,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round,see where east lake is,i've not done that yet,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now,so if you went have you went round curved round the monument
881,are you talking about the very bottom,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round,see where east lake is,i've not done that yet,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake,yeah yeah i've done that i i'm at the finish now
882,no,are you talking about the very bottom,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round,see where east lake is,i've not done that yet,are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake
883,you talking about the bottom right,no,are you talking about the very bottom,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round,see where east lake is,i've not done that yet
884,the bottom left,you talking about the bottom right,no,are you talking about the very bottom,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round,see where east lake is
885,you've just reached there,the bottom left,you talking about the bottom right,no,are you talking about the very bottom,you didn't say that yeah i'm at the i'm at the bottom left of east lake now right and so i curve round
886,yeah,you've just reached there,the bottom left,you talking about the bottom right,no,are you talking about the very bottom
887,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course,yeah,you've just reached there,the bottom left,you talking about the bottom right,no
888,well i've already gone round it,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course,yeah,you've just reached there,the bottom left,you talking about the bottom right
889,right,well i've already gone round it,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course,yeah,you've just reached there,the bottom left
890,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it,right,well i've already gone round it,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course,yeah,you've just reached there
891,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it,right,well i've already gone round it,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course,yeah
892,that's the finish,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it,right,well i've already gone round it,but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well maybe you go round your golf course
893,that's finish point,that's the finish,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it,right,well i've already gone round it
894,right,that's finish point,that's the finish,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it,right
895,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left,right,that's finish point,that's the finish,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake,in one direction do you mean i have to go back round it
896,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left,right,that's finish point,that's the finish,no no that's the finish right see at the the bottom left of east lake
897,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left,right,that's finish point,that's the finish
898,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left,right,that's finish point
899,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left,right
900,yeah yeah mmhmm,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site,eh well just a centimetre past it right to your left
901,so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side,yeah yeah mmhmm,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then,right so i'd i'd have to go up between the golf course and the nuclear test site
902,the left-hand side so i've i've to go round it on the right-hand side,so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side,yeah yeah mmhmm,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,right that's finish point so so i take it that must be another they must be between each other the line should be between that then

1117,and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up,uh-huh,level to the top of the mountain right,uh-huh,see the line should kind of slope towards the right,but i'm a bit high i think
1118,right and is there any obstacles there,and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up,uh-huh,level to the top of the mountain right,uh-huh,see the line should kind of slope towards the right
1119,no none on mine,right and is there any obstacles there,and then it should go straight up from there about an inch and a half just a straight line up,uh-huh,level to the top of the mountain right,uh-huh

1182,what way,it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes,yes mmhmm,right and do you have antelopes,right okay right,right and then from there you kind of go down about two and a half inches
1183,to to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes,what way,it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes,yes mmhmm,right and do you have antelopes,right okay right
1184,oh i came okay right,to to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes,what way,it should be kind of erm the line should be going round the antelopes,yes mmhmm,right and do you have antelopes

1187,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish,mmhmm,right,oh i came okay right,to to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes,what way
1188,from the antelopes an inch and a half,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish,mmhmm,right,oh i came okay right,to to your right your line should be at the left of the antelopes
1189,uh-huh,from the antelopes an inch and a half,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish,mmhmm,right,oh i came okay right
1190,right,uh-huh,from the antelopes an inch and a half,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish,mmhmm,right
1191,right well the start is,right,uh-huh,from the antelopes an inch and a half,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish,mmhmm
1192,i know the start it's marked down here,right well the start is,right,uh-huh,from the antelopes an inch and a half,and just carry on round the antelopes and about an inch and a half just draw a line about an inch and a half to your right and that's your finish

1317,you've come down about one and a half inches,i've just come down a couple of inches,yes,right see where the fast running creek is right,no,right i see right so from the walled city to where i am just there it's at a forty-five degree angle to where i just came from
1318,uh-huh,you've come down about one and a half inches,i've just come down a couple of inches,yes,right see where the fast running creek is right,no
1319,right so if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page right,uh-huh,you've come down about one and a half inches,i've just come down a couple of inches,yes,right see where the fast running creek is right
1320,so i should be around the middle of the page,right so if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page right,uh-huh,you've come down about one and a half inches,i've just come down a couple of inches,yes
1321,no not the the centre no not,so i should be around the middle of the page,right so if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page right,uh-huh,you've come down about one and a half inches,i've just come down a couple of inches
1322,see where i am just now right i've come i've come round the top of the fast running creek,no not the the centre no not,so i should be around the middle of the page,right so if you do it then do a forty-five degree line for maybe about three inches 'til you're probably in line with the top of the walled city that height what you're you've to come down the middle of the page take the forty-five degree line down to the middle of the page right,uh-huh,you've come down about one and a half inches

1941,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there,mmhmm,that line on the west lake goes sharply up,uh-huh,right see where you've stopped draw a straight line in that in that in that angle see where that that vertical see that ehm,uh-huh away down uh-huh
1942,right down to the monument eh,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there,mmhmm,that line on the west lake goes sharply up,uh-huh,right see where you've stopped draw a straight line in that in that in that angle see where that that vertical see that ehm
1943,mmhmm on that angle,right down to the monument eh,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there,mmhmm,that line on the west lake goes sharply up,uh-huh
1944,and eh have you got a golf course,mmhmm on that angle,right down to the monument eh,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there,mmhmm,that line on the west lake goes sharply up
1945,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line,and eh have you got a golf course,mmhmm on that angle,right down to the monument eh,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there,mmhmm
1946,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line,and eh have you got a golf course,mmhmm on that angle,right down to the monument eh,draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there
1947,ah so it is,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line,and eh have you got a golf course,mmhmm on that angle,right down to the monument eh
1948,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course,ah so it is,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line,and eh have you got a golf course,mmhmm on that angle
1949,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course,ah so it is,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line,and eh have you got a golf course
1950,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course,ah so it is,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so,no i take it you're going round the golf course just draw a straight line
1951,and go round underneath it,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course,ah so it is,no the golf course is like nearer the east lake below the east lake so
1952,round the bottom of it,and go round underneath it,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course,ah so it is
1953,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh,round the bottom of it,and go round underneath it,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument,so i would be going to the left-hand side of the golf course
1954,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh,round the bottom of it,and go round underneath it,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving,right so where see the monument is you're going underneath the monument and up okay you're curving round the monument
1955,no,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh,round the bottom of it,and go round underneath it,i'm i'm doing like a i'm drawing a straight line down to the monument and curving
1956,between the west lake and the monument,no,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh,round the bottom of it,and go round underneath it
1957,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point,between the west lake and the monument,no,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh,round the bottom of it
1958,where's that so i have i have to avoid it,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point,between the west lake and the monument,no,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below,and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh
1959,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up,where's that so i have i have to avoid it,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point,between the west lake and the monument,no,i mean and like you've not got any obstacles here have you below
1960,but where is it anyway,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up,where's that so i have i have to avoid it,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point,between the west lake and the monument,no
1961,where the vertical bit is,but where is it anyway,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up,where's that so i have i have to avoid it,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point,between the west lake and the monument
1962,where is it,where the vertical bit is,but where is it anyway,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up,where's that so i have i have to avoid it,the west lake and the monument i've got a trig point
1963,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake,where is it,where the vertical bit is,but where is it anyway,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up,where's that so i have i have to avoid it
1964,uh-huh,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake,where is it,where the vertical bit is,but where is it anyway,that's that's it's it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up
1965,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake,uh-huh,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake,where is it,where the vertical bit is,but where is it anyway
1966,okay right so if i draw down,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake,uh-huh,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake,where is it,where the vertical bit is
1967,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake,okay right so if i draw down,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake,uh-huh,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake,where is it
1968,i will have right uh-huh,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake,okay right so if i draw down,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake,uh-huh,see where the west lake is with the writing west lake
1969,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line,i will have right uh-huh,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake,okay right so if i draw down,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake,uh-huh
1970,a straight line,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line,i will have right uh-huh,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake,okay right so if i draw down,it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake
1971,going sloping downwards towards the monument,a straight line,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line,i will have right uh-huh,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake,okay right so if i draw down
1972,right i've and then curve round the monument,going sloping downwards towards the monument,a straight line,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line,i will have right uh-huh,you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake
1973,round the monument,right i've and then curve round the monument,going sloping downwards towards the monument,a straight line,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line,i will have right uh-huh
1974,right,round the monument,right i've and then curve round the monument,going sloping downwards towards the monument,a straight line,you will right and then you go straight it's a total straight line
1975,just right round that,right,round the monument,right i've and then curve round the monument,going sloping downwards towards the monument,a straight line
1976,i've done that,just right round that,right,round the monument,right i've and then curve round the monument,going sloping downwards towards the monument
1977,eh sort of right are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head,i've done that,just right round that,right,round the monument,right i've and then curve round the monument
1978,yes that's where i am,eh sort of right are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head,i've done that,just right round that,right,round the monument
1979,right stop about there okay curved above it ehm you know the east lake is,yes that's where i am,eh sort of right are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head,i've done that,just right round that,right
1980,uh-huh,right stop about there okay curved above it ehm you know the east lake is,yes that's where i am,eh sort of right are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head,i've done that,just right round that

2573,right,okay down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map,right okay,okay well you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it,that's right,right
2574,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left,right,okay down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map,right okay,okay well you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it,that's right
2575,no i've got a banana tree though,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left,right,okay down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map,right okay,okay well you need to go ehm travel left about an inch and then go down along the side of the missionary camp so you're going downwards just running along parallel to it
2576,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same,no i've got a banana tree though,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left,right,okay down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map,right okay
2577,yeah that's probably about it,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same,no i've got a banana tree though,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left,right,okay down so that you're about an inch above the bottom of the map
2578,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree,yeah that's probably about it,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same,no i've got a banana tree though,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left,right
2579,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree,yeah that's probably about it,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same,no i've got a banana tree though,okay now you have you got a some gorillas over on the left
2580,right okay,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree,yeah that's probably about it,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same,no i've got a banana tree though
2581,right nothing else kind of down there,right okay,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree,yeah that's probably about it,alright that's probably do you think that's probably the same
2582,right,right nothing else kind of down there,right okay,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree,yeah that's probably about it
2583,and i want to stop directly below,right,right nothing else kind of down there,right okay,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that,mm yeah so you just need to run along the bottom of the map until you get to just below the gorillas or the banana tree
2584,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map,and i want to stop directly below,right,right nothing else kind of down there,right okay,right er we'll probably have to take it down a wee bit further for for that
2585,mmhmm right that's okay,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map,and i want to stop directly below,right,right nothing else kind of down there,right okay
2586,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge,mmhmm right that's okay,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map,and i want to stop directly below,right,right nothing else kind of down there
2587,yeah,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge,mmhmm right that's okay,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map,and i want to stop directly below,right
2588,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge,yeah,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge,mmhmm right that's okay,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map,and i want to stop directly below
2589,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge,yeah,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge,mmhmm right that's okay,yeah well actually you need to then you need to bend up round the side of the gorillas so you're then going along so you're running parallel with the eh left-hand side of the map
2590,ah right,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge,yeah,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge,mmhmm right that's okay
2591,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across,ah right,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge,yeah,okay so you then go upwards about and then have you got a rope bridge
2592,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across,ah right,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge,yeah
2593,right okay,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across,ah right,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so,right you need to run up vertically until you become parallel with the rope bridge
2594,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge,right okay,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across,ah right,oh i've taken it over much further than that i'm kind of almost at the edge of the page so
2595,right fine,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge,right okay,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across,ah right
2596,okay down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch,right fine,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge,right okay,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge,is it okay is it safe enough to head diagonally across
2597,right erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually,okay down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch,right fine,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge,right okay,yeah if you head diagonally across to the beginning of the rope bridge
2598,oh yeah i yeah there's a river isn't there well if you just take it so that you're running alongside the river,right erm i don't know if i can do that without going in the river actually,okay down about an inch so you come you've come off the rope bridge and you drop down about an inch,right fine,and then you you're walking across the rope bridge so your line will stop and then start coming out at the other side of the rope bridge,right okay

5789,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,uh-huh,you're certainly above it right,i'm above banana tree,so you don't have that ehm right well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are,right well no i haven't got that
5790,okay,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,uh-huh,you're certainly above it right,i'm above banana tree,so you don't have that ehm right well mine that must mean that this that you can bypass this obstacle so ehm from where you are you're you're you're next to banana tree the word aren't you yeah is that where you are
5791,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,okay,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,uh-huh,you're certainly above it right,i'm above banana tree
5792,from banana tree over to rope bridge,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,okay,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,uh-huh,you're certainly above it right
5793,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge,from banana tree over to rope bridge,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,okay,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree,uh-huh
5794,okay,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge,from banana tree over to rope bridge,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,okay,okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree
5795,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line,okay,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge,from banana tree over to rope bridge,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down,okay
5796,mmhmm,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line,okay,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge,from banana tree over to rope bridge,now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down
5797,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there,mmhmm,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line,okay,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge,from banana tree over to rope bridge
5798,sorry say that again,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there,mmhmm,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line,okay,yeah well no no no just a vertical line straight down ehm to just below the level of rope bridge
5799,right,sorry say that again,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there,mmhmm,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line,okay
5800,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now,right,sorry say that again,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there,mmhmm,right and then eh and it's about ehm it's near the midpoint of eh banana tree rock fall line
5801,you're beside rope bridge,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now,right,sorry say that again,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there,mmhmm
5802,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to,you're beside rope bridge,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now,right,sorry say that again,it's just slightly below that ehm then you want to go eh right ehm from left to right want to draw horizontal line ehm to about the middle of the page if there's if there's no obstacle there
5803,yes i meant to go straight down yeah,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to,you're beside rope bridge,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now,right,sorry say that again
5804,right okay i'll just change that,yes i meant to go straight down yeah,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to,you're beside rope bridge,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now,right
5805,right,right okay i'll just change that,yes i meant to go straight down yeah,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to,you're beside rope bridge,right i'm i'm beside rope bridge just now
5806,uh-huh,right,right okay i'll just change that,yes i meant to go straight down yeah,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to,you're beside rope bridge
5807,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly,uh-huh,right,right okay i'll just change that,yes i meant to go straight down yeah,did you mean just go straight keep going down but not go to
5808,okay,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly,uh-huh,right,right okay i'll just change that,yes i meant to go straight down yeah
5809,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge,okay,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly,uh-huh,right,right okay i'll just change that
5810,mmhmm,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge,okay,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly,uh-huh,right
5811,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself,mmhmm,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge,okay,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly,uh-huh
5812,mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself,mmhmm,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge,okay,right so you've just drawn a a vertical line from banana tree down right now you want to go eh from left to right ehm about to the middle of the page roughly
5813,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page,mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself,mmhmm,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge,okay
5814,roughly okay,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page,mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself,mmhmm,right then you want to draw a a vertical line from there up the way eh to the same level as the rope bridge
5815,right then,roughly okay,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page,mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page,not the rope bridge word but the actual rope bridge itself,mmhmm

5817,right from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram,mmhmm,right then,roughly okay,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page,mmhmm and this would be like sort of in the centre of the page
5818,uh-huh right,right from there you want to eh go from left to right across the rope bridge and it's actually ehm if if you think of a it was it's not on the rope bridge the word but the rope bridge itself you want the the the line to pass through the diagram,mmhmm,right then,roughly okay,it's more or less yes in the centre of the page

5823,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes,uh-huh,right now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly,okay,right,uh-huh right
5824,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes,uh-huh,right now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly,okay,right
5825,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes,uh-huh,right now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly,okay
5826,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes,uh-huh,right now do you have giraffes in eh below rope bridge roughly
5827,right i see right,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes,uh-huh
5828,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes,right i see right,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge,right ehm now you want to eh draw a vertical line down from the where you've just left the rope bridge but to the the right of the giraffes
5829,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes,right i see right,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge,do you do you have crocodiles underneath the rope bridge
5830,no that that won't that won't affect it,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes,right i see right,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge,no right so there's crocodiles on yours ehm there's no crocodiles on mine whereabouts are they eh as with respect to the rope bridge
5831,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page,no that that won't that won't affect it,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes,right i see right,directly underneath the right-hand side of the rope bridge
5832,from before crossing the rope bridge,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page,no that that won't that won't affect it,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes,right i see right
5833,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right,from before crossing the rope bridge,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page,no that that won't that won't affect it,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay,so if there's no obstruction beneath the rope bridge on the other side before you cross it do you think i could go from directly from there to the giraffes
5834,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right,from before crossing the rope bridge,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page,no that that won't that won't affect it,yeah i i suppose if as long as we don't draw over the the crocodiles themselves it'll be okay
5835,oh right so they're so they're actually barring that way,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right,from before crossing the rope bridge,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page,no that that won't that won't affect it
5836,without the crocodiles well i imagine so less i just drew round them which i suppose i could,oh right so they're so they're actually barring that way,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right,from before crossing the rope bridge,right okay so as long as you avoid them eh if you can just extend your horizontal line out to the the just from the the side of the page
5837,eh can you actually draw round them,without the crocodiles well i imagine so less i just drew round them which i suppose i could,oh right so they're so they're actually barring that way,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right,from before crossing the rope bridge
5838,well yeah i suppose,eh can you actually draw round them,without the crocodiles well i imagine so less i just drew round them which i suppose i could,oh right so they're so they're actually barring that way,but then i can't actually get from the other end of the rope bridge to the giraffes,well no i'm i want you to cross the rope bridge right

5852,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner,so that's it finished then,okay,well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that,where's the finish just there,yeah
5853,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner,so that's it finished then,okay,well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that,where's the finish just there
5854,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner,so that's it finished then,okay,well the finish is just between rock fall and great lake it's it's not directly between them but it's on the same level as that
5855,no right,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner,so that's it finished then,okay
5856,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop,no right,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner,so that's it finished then
5857,no it's just allotments to the eh right,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop,no right,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right,right eh from start position you move down past the camera shop to the bottom left corner
5858,no,no it's just allotments to the eh right,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop,no right,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop,right right the camera shop's directly below the start position right
5859,and slightly below,no,no it's just allotments to the eh right,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop,no right,yes you move down to past the left-hand side of the camera shop
5860,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments,and slightly below,no,no it's just allotments to the eh right,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop,no right
5861,and where do i stop,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments,and slightly below,no,no it's just allotments to the eh right,and have you got parked van marked there beneath the camera shop
5862,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed,and where do i stop,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments,and slightly below,no,no it's just allotments to the eh right
5863,right right,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed,and where do i stop,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments,and slightly below,no
5864,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop,right right,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed,and where do i stop,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments,and slightly below
5865,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop,right right,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed,and where do i stop,you move well approximately three inches below the camera shop you make an arc and then move up up and around the left-hand side of the allotments
5866,it's not marked on my map,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop,right right,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed,and where do i stop
5867,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically,it's not marked on my map,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop,right right,stop just at the the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed
5868,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically,it's not marked on my map,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop,right right
5869,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically,it's not marked on my map,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the,then you move in an angle sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop
5870,a straight line yes,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically,it's not marked on my map,so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the
5871,right from there to just above the camera shop,a straight line yes,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically,it's not marked on my map
5872,yeah approximately two thirds away from the right-hand side of the page,right from there to just above the camera shop,a straight line yes,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop,oh right ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically
5873,uh from the right-hand side of the page,yeah approximately two thirds away from the right-hand side of the page,right from there to just above the camera shop,a straight line yes,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line,slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop
5874,no sorry one third away from the right-hand side of the page,uh from the right-hand side of the page,yeah approximately two thirds away from the right-hand side of the page,right from there to just above the camera shop,a straight line yes,right so you make an angle and that's a straight line

5886,approximately three inches,right so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about,to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left,and uh right okay that's okay,above the monastery,what on top of the monastery
5887,same level as the camera shop basically,approximately three inches,right so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about,to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left,and uh right okay that's okay,above the monastery
5888,three four inches yeah,same level as the camera shop basically,approximately three inches,right so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about,to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left,and uh right okay that's okay
5889,and then eh from there going to disused monastery,three four inches yeah,same level as the camera shop basically,approximately three inches,right so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about,to the left up the to the right and then curves over to the left
5890,yes,and then eh from there going to disused monastery,three four inches yeah,same level as the camera shop basically,approximately three inches,right so we're going from like above the allotments to just above the yacht club no just above but ehm about
5891,right,yes,and then eh from there going to disused monastery,three four inches yeah,same level as the camera shop basically,approximately three inches
5892,curving around the top of the disused monastery,right,yes,and then eh from there going to disused monastery,three four inches yeah,same level as the camera shop basically
5893,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where,curving around the top of the disused monastery,right,yes,and then eh from there going to disused monastery,three four inches yeah
5894,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where,curving around the top of the disused monastery,right,yes,and then eh from there going to disused monastery
5895,right could you just say that again,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where,curving around the top of the disused monastery,right,yes
5896,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough,right could you just say that again,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where,curving around the top of the disused monastery,right
5897,right,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough,right could you just say that again,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where,curving around the top of the disused monastery
5898,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden,right,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough,right could you just say that again,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden,yeah right right so curve around the disused monastery then where
5899,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden,right,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough,right could you just say that again,and stop on the level with the base of it then the curve reverses itself and goes approximately like it was before and then goes vertically up the side of the the alpine garden
5900,no a curve going down the way uh,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden,right,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough,right could you just say that again
5901,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically,no a curve going down the way uh,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden,right,right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough
5902,yes,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically,no a curve going down the way uh,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden,right
5903,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden,yes,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically,no a curve going down the way uh,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery,and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden
5904,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden,yes,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically,no a curve going down the way uh,right so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery
5905,right right,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden,yes,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically,no a curve going down the way uh
5906,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel,right right,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden,yes,that's what i mean i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically
5907,there is no youth hostel,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel,right right,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden,yes
5908,then about three inches,there is no youth hostel,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel,right right,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden,right and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden
5909,where was the youth hostel,then about three inches,there is no youth hostel,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel,right right,yeah you stop on a level with the disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden
5910,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically,where was the youth hostel,then about three inches,there is no youth hostel,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel,right right
5911,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically,where was the youth hostel,then about three inches,there is no youth hostel,then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden then you go right to the end of the alpine garden then vertically again to the top of the youth hostel
5912,after where,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically,where was the youth hostel,then about three inches,there is no youth hostel
5913,after the this youth hostel,after where,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically,where was the youth hostel,then about three inches
5914,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical,after the this youth hostel,after where,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically,where was the youth hostel
5915,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical,after the this youth hostel,after where,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that,youth hostel was upwards and to the right of the alpine garden if you go up from four inches from where you stopped at the alpine garden vertically
5916,the telephone box,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical,after the this youth hostel,after where,right right i think i know where it is right ehm where where would i be going after that
5917,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van,the telephone box,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical,after the this youth hostel,after where
5918,no you go to about two inches below the parked van,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van,the telephone box,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical,after the this youth hostel
5919,right right and then from there,no you go to about two inches below the parked van,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van,the telephone box,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to,after youth hostel you'd be going an inch to your right and then a diagonal line sloping at approximately eh what'd it be now hundred and thirty five degrees from vertical
5920,you go,right right and then from there,no you go to about two inches below the parked van,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van,the telephone box,right eh can you give me a name of an object i'll be going to
5921,so it's,you go,right right and then from there,no you go to about two inches below the parked van,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van,the telephone box
5922,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box,so it's,you go,right right and then from there,no you go to about two inches below the parked van,right okay uh right so i go up just below just to below the parked van have you got a parked van
5923,right all right underneath the telephone telephone box,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box,so it's,you go,right right and then from there,no you go to about two inches below the parked van
5924,yes,right all right underneath the telephone telephone box,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box,so it's,you go,right right and then from there
5925,right,yes,right all right underneath the telephone telephone box,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box,so it's,you go
5926,not directly underneath it you're going to draw a you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box,right,yes,right all right underneath the telephone telephone box,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box,so it's
5927,right right okay okay,not directly underneath it you're going to draw a you're going to have to draw a straight line adding on to that that passes underneath the telephone box,right,yes,right all right underneath the telephone telephone box,two inches right from that and then a straight line diagonally 'til underneath the telephone box

6050,yeah until you come to the next peak there,and then do a curved line right okay,yeah,okay so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh crest,to bay yeah uh-huh,oh right to the right to curve round right
6051,right,yeah until you come to the next peak there,and then do a curved line right okay,yeah,okay so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh crest,to bay yeah uh-huh
6052,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore,right,yeah until you come to the next peak there,and then do a curved line right okay,yeah,okay so eh i'm going for a straight line from concealed hideout to the first eh crest
6053,yes,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore,right,yeah until you come to the next peak there,and then do a curved line right okay,yeah
6054,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm,yes,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore,right,yeah until you come to the next peak there,and then do a curved line right okay
6055,there's no such thing on this map,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm,yes,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore,right,yeah until you come to the next peak there
6056,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there,there's no such thing on this map,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm,yes,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore,right
6057,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there,there's no such thing on this map,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm,yes,okay right from now on you're going to go generally in a diagonal from right to left okay but i want you to draw above have you got pebbled shore
6058,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there,there's no such thing on this map,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm,yes
6059,what you you mean curve,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there,there's no such thing on this map,well on my map above directly above pebbled shore there's coconut palm
6060,can make it curve curve downwards a bit,what you you mean curve,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there,there's no such thing on this map
6061,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore,can make it curve curve downwards a bit,what you you mean curve,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore,okay so i want you to draw from right to left in a in a diagonal passing the top of pebbled shore okay can you do that and just stop at the end of pebbled shore there
6062,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore,can make it curve curve downwards a bit,what you you mean curve,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit,right okay so it's just a diagonal from that first crest to above pebbled shore
6063,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore,can make it curve curve downwards a bit,what you you mean curve,uh-huh can you make it can you make that a diagonal sink downwards a bit
6064,it's above pebbled shore to the right of pebbled shore just above,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore,can make it curve curve downwards a bit,what you you mean curve
6065,above and to the right right i understand now is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastline,it's above pebbled shore to the right of pebbled shore just above,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore,can make it curve curve downwards a bit
6066,ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastline,above and to the right right i understand now is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastline,it's above pebbled shore to the right of pebbled shore just above,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go,right so to make it curve above pebbled shore
6067,right okay right so curve right,ehm the same distance away as pebbled shore is away from the lower coastline,above and to the right right i understand now is it ehm how far roughly is it from the the coastline,it's above pebbled shore to the right of pebbled shore just above,where where is the object eh you're trying to avoid,but yeah but still so that it's more following the the the coastline again okay but coming away to go

6109,yes,no so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right,no,so have you got a flight museum on your,slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point,yes
6110,and how far away from the yacht club,yes,no so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right,no,so have you got a flight museum on your,slightly to the left of that you have to draw a point on a level with the the top of the camera shop and then draw a straight line from the corner of the allotments to that point
6111,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club,and how far away from the yacht club,yes,no so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right,no,so have you got a flight museum on your
6112,uh-huh right,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club,and how far away from the yacht club,yes,no so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right,no
6113,you got that,uh-huh right,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club,and how far away from the yacht club,yes,no so i've got to go along from the allotments to the right
6114,mmhmm,you got that,uh-huh right,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club,and how far away from the yacht club,yes
6115,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery,mmhmm,you got that,uh-huh right,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club,and how far away from the yacht club
6116,straight up right,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery,mmhmm,you got that,uh-huh right,it's on a it's on a level with the the roof of the camera shop horizontally and vertically slightly to the left of the yacht club
6117,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery,straight up right,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery,mmhmm,you got that,uh-huh right
6118,mmhmm above the monastery,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery,straight up right,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery,mmhmm,you got that
6119,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve,mmhmm above the monastery,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery,straight up right,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery,mmhmm
6120,so it's right round the monastery,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve,mmhmm above the monastery,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery,straight up right,then you go straight up and curve over the top of the disused monastery
6121,yeah,so it's right round the monastery,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve,mmhmm above the monastery,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery,straight up right
6122,mmhmm,yeah,so it's right round the monastery,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve,mmhmm above the monastery,have you over are you eh curved over the monastery
6123,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden,mmhmm,yeah,so it's right round the monastery,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve,mmhmm above the monastery
6124,mmhmm,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden,mmhmm,yeah,so it's right round the monastery,you go down to the left-hand side in this following the same curve
6125,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there,mmhmm,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden,mmhmm,yeah,so it's right round the monastery
6126,no,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there,mmhmm,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden,mmhmm,yeah
6127,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right,no,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there,mmhmm,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden,mmhmm
6128,have you got parked van,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right,no,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there,mmhmm,then at that point the curve reverses itself and dips round to a level which is vertically at the left-hand side of the alpine garden roughly but it ends at the same line as the disused monastery in a curve that dips down from the left-hand side of it then you go straight up to the left-hand side of the alpine garden
6129,yes it's it's below the parked van,have you got parked van,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right,no,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there,mmhmm
6130,uh-huh,yes it's it's below the parked van,have you got parked van,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right,no,then to the right 'til the other side of the the alpine garden and straight up now have you got a youth hostel marked there
6131,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that,uh-huh,yes it's it's below the parked van,have you got parked van,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right,no
6132,yeah,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that,uh-huh,yes it's it's below the parked van,have you got parked van,no well you go up about four inches from the alpine garden and then draw a line two inches to the right
6133,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence,yeah,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that,uh-huh,yes it's it's below the parked van,have you got parked van
6134,right uh-huh,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence,yeah,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that,uh-huh,yes it's it's below the parked van
6135,and then you go to your right,right uh-huh,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence,yeah,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that,uh-huh
6136,underneath the parked van,and then you go to your right,right uh-huh,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence,yeah,it's about it's below the level of the picket fence have you got that
6137,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that,underneath the parked van,and then you go to your right,right uh-huh,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence,yeah
6138,uh-huh,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that,underneath the parked van,and then you go to your right,right uh-huh,it's about an inch below the level of the picket fence
6139,and do you have a telephone box,uh-huh,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that,underneath the parked van,and then you go to your right,right uh-huh
6140,yeah,and do you have a telephone box,uh-huh,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that,underneath the parked van,and then you go to your right
6141,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to,yeah,and do you have a telephone box,uh-huh,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that,underneath the parked van
6142,i don't have youth hostel,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to,yeah,and do you have a telephone box,uh-huh,yes to to roughly about the middle of the parked van a line and that
6143,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round,i don't have youth hostel,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to,yeah,and do you have a telephone box,uh-huh
6144,mmhmm,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round,i don't have youth hostel,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to,yeah,and do you have a telephone box
6145,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's,mmhmm,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round,i don't have youth hostel,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to,yeah
6146,so vertical have you got level crossing,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's,mmhmm,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round,i don't have youth hostel,well do you the next stage is you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-hand side of the youth hostel down to
6147,no,so vertical have you got level crossing,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's,mmhmm,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round,i don't have youth hostel
6148,no,no,so vertical have you got level crossing,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's,mmhmm,oh right well from that point that i've just gone round
6149,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box,no,no,so vertical have you got level crossing,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's,mmhmm
6150,uh-huh,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box,no,no,so vertical have you got level crossing,down to the it's slightly to the left of the telephone box 'cause there's
6151,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at,uh-huh,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box,no,no,so vertical have you got level crossing
6152,right right i've done that,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at,uh-huh,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box,no,no
6153,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box,right right i've done that,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at,uh-huh,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box,no
6154,mmhmm,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box,right right i've done that,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at,uh-huh,there's a there's a horizontal line that goes under the telephone box
6155,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake,mmhmm,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box,right right i've done that,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at,uh-huh
6156,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake,mmhmm,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box,right right i've done that,eh that's on a line with the yacht club and you've to draw a diagonal line between that and the point you've just ended at
6157,yes,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake,mmhmm,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box,right right i've done that
6158,right to the middle of the east lake,yes,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake,mmhmm,then you go up to about slightly above the top of the telephone box
6159,to a line approximately just it's below the,right to the middle of the east lake,yes,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake,mmhmm
6160,yeah uh-huh,to a line approximately just it's below the,right to the middle of the east lake,yes,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that,then the path curves it in a follows a curve rising to the left until it reaches a line approximately level with the middle of east lake that's a a vertical line approximately the middle of east lake
6161,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence,yeah uh-huh,to a line approximately just it's below the,right to the middle of the east lake,yes,mmhmm so i've got a level cross between telephone box and the east lake so i curve round that
6162,mm right done that,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence,yeah uh-huh,to a line approximately just it's below the,right to the middle of the east lake,yes
6163,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side,mm right done that,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence,yeah uh-huh,to a line approximately just it's below the,right to the middle of the east lake
6164,mmhmm so sorry say that again,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side,mm right done that,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence,yeah uh-huh,to a line approximately just it's below the
6165,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence,mmhmm so sorry say that again,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side,mm right done that,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence,yeah uh-huh
6166,mmhmm,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence,mmhmm so sorry say that again,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side,mm right done that,east lake it's approximately level with the the bottom of the picket fence
6167,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake,mmhmm,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence,mmhmm so sorry say that again,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side,mm right done that
6168,right actually touches the,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake,mmhmm,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence,mmhmm so sorry say that again,right and from there it's a straight line to another line which is ehm level with the top of the picket fence and the furthest most part of east lake that bulge that goes out the left-hand side
6169,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake,right actually touches the,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake,mmhmm,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence,mmhmm so sorry say that again
6170,no right think that's where it is,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake,right actually touches the,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake,mmhmm,on a eh the finish point is on a line level with the picket fence
6171,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map,no right think that's where it is,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake,right actually touches the,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake,mmhmm
6172,oh,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map,no right think that's where it is,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake,right actually touches the,about the middle of the picket fence and a vertical line that touches the outer the left most part of east lake
6173,but it's marked well,oh,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map,no right think that's where it is,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake,right actually touches the
6174,okay i was looking at the top,but it's marked well,oh,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map,no right think that's where it is,it doesn't eh doesn't actually touch the east lake
6175,have you found it,okay i was looking at the top,but it's marked well,oh,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map,no right think that's where it is
6176,yeah it's okay,have you found it,okay i was looking at the top,but it's marked well,oh,start top of the extinct volcano it's the bottom right-hand corner of the map
6177,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left,yeah it's okay,have you found it,okay i was looking at the top,but it's marked well,oh
6178,mmhmm,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left,yeah it's okay,have you found it,okay i was looking at the top,but it's marked well
6179,and stop,mmhmm,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left,yeah it's okay,have you found it,okay i was looking at the top
6180,is that horizontally,and stop,mmhmm,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left,yeah it's okay,have you found it
6181,horizontally yeah sorry,is that horizontally,and stop,mmhmm,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left,yeah it's okay
6182,okay,horizontally yeah sorry,is that horizontally,and stop,mmhmm,right and if you move maybe one and a half centimetres from the top of there to the left
6183,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it,okay,horizontally yeah sorry,is that horizontally,and stop,mmhmm
6184,pen's not working there that's done it okay,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it,okay,horizontally yeah sorry,is that horizontally,and stop
6185,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement,pen's not working there that's done it okay,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it,okay,horizontally yeah sorry,is that horizontally
6186,no,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement,pen's not working there that's done it okay,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it,okay,horizontally yeah sorry
6187,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map,no,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement,pen's not working there that's done it okay,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it,okay
6188,mm,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map,no,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement,pen's not working there that's done it okay,and then go down vertically about maybe five centimetres so you're actually below the extinct volcano you go down the left-hand side of it
6189,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped,mm,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map,no,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement,pen's not working there that's done it okay
6190,okay mmhmm,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped,mm,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map,no,and stop about you're there then you go horizontally left have you got a tribal settlement
6191,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge,okay mmhmm,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped,mm,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map,no
6192,just in a horizontal line,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge,okay mmhmm,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped,mm,that's in the bottom left-hand corner of the map
6193,horizontal line straight across,just in a horizontal line,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge,okay mmhmm,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped,mm
6194,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement,horizontal line straight across,just in a horizontal line,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge,okay mmhmm,it's just a bit below the extinct volcano but sort just about the same level but the opposite side so you go from that point where you stopped
6195,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement,horizontal line straight across,just in a horizontal line,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge,okay mmhmm
6196,uh-huh,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement,horizontal line straight across,just in a horizontal line,along to the left-hand corner of the map to about one and a half centimetres from the edge
6197,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement,uh-huh,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement,horizontal line straight across,just in a horizontal line
6198,okay how far away from the edge of the paper,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement,uh-huh,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement,horizontal line straight across
6199,one and a half centimetres,okay how far away from the edge of the paper,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement,uh-huh,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it,okay do i have to do anything to avoid the the settlement
6200,okay,one and a half centimetres,okay how far away from the edge of the paper,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement,uh-huh,well if you if you go if you're just below the extinct volcano just now a bit below it
6201,stop,okay,one and a half centimetres,okay how far away from the edge of the paper,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement,uh-huh
6202,just get my ruler out,stop,okay,one and a half centimetres,okay how far away from the edge of the paper,you can go straight along and you'll be underneath the tribal settlement
6203,have you got a rope bridge,just get my ruler out,stop,okay,one and a half centimetres,okay how far away from the edge of the paper
6204,yeah,have you got a rope bridge,just get my ruler out,stop,okay,one and a half centimetres
6205,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean,yeah,have you got a rope bridge,just get my ruler out,stop,okay
6206,mmhmm,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean,yeah,have you got a rope bridge,just get my ruler out,stop
6207,so,mmhmm,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean,yeah,have you got a rope bridge,just get my ruler out
6208,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper,so,mmhmm,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean,yeah,have you got a rope bridge
6209,upwards for about,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper,so,mmhmm,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean,yeah
6210,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge,upwards for about,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper,so,mmhmm,if you go straight up the left-hand side of where the tribal settlement would be 'til you're ehm just maybe below the rope bridge but like in a straight line so you're not absolutely underneath it but you're to the left-hand side of it because it curves round over onto the rope bridge you know what i mean
6211,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge,upwards for about,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper,so,mmhmm
6212,below the writing of rope bridge,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge,upwards for about,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper,so
6213,no,below the writing of rope bridge,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge,upwards for about,okay so i i go upwards like the same distance away from the paper
6214,below,no,below the writing of rope bridge,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge,upwards for about
6215,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge,below,no,below the writing of rope bridge,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round,the edge of the paper until i'm just across from the rope bridge
6216,uh-huh,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge,below,no,below the writing of rope bridge,yeah no 'til you've maybe one centimetre below it and then you sort of curve round
6217,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge,uh-huh,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge,below,no,below the writing of rope bridge
6218,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge,uh-huh,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge,below,no
6219,yes you,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge,uh-huh,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge,below
6220,okay,yes you,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge,uh-huh,below do you the left-hand side of the rope bridge
6221,are you crossing the rope bridge,okay,yes you,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge,uh-huh
6222,you want me to cross it uh-huh,are you crossing the rope bridge,okay,yes you,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah,but you don't go a straight line and then turn you curve round onto the rope bridge
6223,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge,you want me to cross it uh-huh,are you crossing the rope bridge,okay,yes you,okay so i'm going to cross the rope bridge yeah
6224,okay,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge,you want me to cross it uh-huh,are you crossing the rope bridge,okay,yes you
6225,and then stop when you get to the other side,okay,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge,you want me to cross it uh-huh,are you crossing the rope bridge,okay
6226,uh-huh,and then stop when you get to the other side,okay,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge,you want me to cross it uh-huh,are you crossing the rope bridge
6227,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres,uh-huh,and then stop when you get to the other side,okay,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge,you want me to cross it uh-huh
6228,mmhmm,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres,uh-huh,and then stop when you get to the other side,okay,well if you curve round slightly and cross the rope bridge
6229,so,mmhmm,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres,uh-huh,and then stop when you get to the other side,okay
6230,do you have a machete,so,mmhmm,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres,uh-huh,and then stop when you get to the other side
6231,no i don't where's the machete,do you have a machete,so,mmhmm,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres,uh-huh
6232,it's to the right and just down,no i don't where's the machete,do you have a machete,so,mmhmm,because you've got to curve down ehm it's not a wide curve it's quite a narrow curve down two centimetres
6233,from the rope bridge,it's to the right and just down,no i don't where's the machete,do you have a machete,so,mmhmm
6234,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay,from the rope bridge,it's to the right and just down,no i don't where's the machete,do you have a machete,so
6235,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay,from the rope bridge,it's to the right and just down,no i don't where's the machete,do you have a machete
6236,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay,from the rope bridge,it's to the right and just down,no i don't where's the machete
6237,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay,from the rope bridge,it's to the right and just down
6238,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay,from the rope bridge
6239,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down,it's to it's about three centimetres to the right and just down from the rope bridge so if i if i curve down and and go underneath where that is is that okay
6240,uh-huh just above there,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map,is that curving down a lot 'cause it's only about one and a half centimetres two centimetres you've got to curve down
6241,yeah,uh-huh just above there,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position,mmhmm well where would i go once i curve down on your map
6242,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh,yeah,uh-huh just above there,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then,you turn right and go straight across so you're you're about three centimetres above the start position
6243,about two underneath it,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh,yeah,uh-huh just above there,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter,okay that's fine i'll just go underneath it then
6244,that's fine,about two underneath it,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh,yeah,uh-huh just above there,and stop when you're you're have you got a collapsed shelter
6245,have you got a saxon barn,that's fine,about two underneath it,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh,yeah,uh-huh just above there
6246,uh-huh,have you got a saxon barn,that's fine,about two underneath it,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh,yeah
6247,well you go straight up from that point where you were,uh-huh,have you got a saxon barn,that's fine,about two underneath it,so i should be like just underneath the collapsed shelter uh-huh
6248,mm,well you go straight up from that point where you were,uh-huh,have you got a saxon barn,that's fine,about two underneath it
6249,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn,mm,well you go straight up from that point where you were,uh-huh,have you got a saxon barn,that's fine
6250,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn,mm,well you go straight up from that point where you were,uh-huh,have you got a saxon barn
6251,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn,mm,well you go straight up from that point where you were,uh-huh
6252,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn,mm,well you go straight up from that point where you were
6253,no straight line upwards,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn,mm
6254,well i can't do that,no straight line upwards,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left,past the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter just go straight up until you're on level with the top of the saxon barn
6255,why not,well i can't do that,no straight line upwards,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map,mmhmm so just so just in a diagonal upwards from right to left
6256,'cause my saxon barn's on the,why not,well i can't do that,no straight line upwards,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the,and stop there no straight line up to the left-hand side of collapsed shelter so you're on the level with the top of saxon barn but not actually near it you're still on the right-hand side of the map
6257,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter,'cause my saxon barn's on the,why not,well i can't do that,no straight line upwards,so it's a it is a diagonal upwards towards the
6258,uh-huh,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter,'cause my saxon barn's on the,why not,well i can't do that,no straight line upwards
6259,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it,uh-huh,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter,'cause my saxon barn's on the,why not,well i can't do that
6260,oh okay have you got a crevasse,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it,uh-huh,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter,'cause my saxon barn's on the,why not
6261,no,oh okay have you got a crevasse,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it,uh-huh,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter,'cause my saxon barn's on the
6262,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn,no,oh okay have you got a crevasse,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it,uh-huh,no you go straight up the left-hand side of the collapsed shelter
6263,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn,no,oh okay have you got a crevasse,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it,uh-huh
6264,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn,no,oh okay have you got a crevasse,you're not going over towards the saxon barn yet you're going to be on the same level with it
6265,if you go well i was going,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn,no,oh okay have you got a crevasse
6266,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah,if you go well i was going,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn,no
6267,but the the top of it,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah,if you go well i was going,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn,well have you got anything to the right of the saxon barn
6268,okay,but the the top of it,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah,if you go well i was going,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay,no so if you go straight up would you curve round the crevasse to get to the saxon barn
6269,just a bit above and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn,okay,but the the top of it,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah,if you go well i was going,if i went a bit to the right i could just go straight up would that be okay
6270,say that again i'm on just now i'm on a horizontal line just beside above the saxon barn,just a bit above and you go straight up and curve round and then down and underneath the saxon barn,okay,but the the top of it,so i'd be on like a horizontal line with the saxon barn yeah,if you go well i was going

10512,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it,in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well,and is that the only obstacle you've got,yeah uh-huh uh-huh,right now you've got have you got a rift valley in the top right hand corner,right
10513,right so it's straight up to the rift valley,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it,in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well,and is that the only obstacle you've got,yeah uh-huh uh-huh,right now you've got have you got a rift valley in the top right hand corner
10514,uh-huh,right so it's straight up to the rift valley,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it,in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well,and is that the only obstacle you've got,yeah uh-huh uh-huh
10515,and then down through the middle of it,uh-huh,right so it's straight up to the rift valley,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it,in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well,and is that the only obstacle you've got
10516,down through the middle of it yes,and then down through the middle of it,uh-huh,right so it's straight up to the rift valley,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it,in just where i'm going there's a cactus as well
10517,right,down through the middle of it yes,and then down through the middle of it,uh-huh,right so it's straight up to the rift valley,right well you want to go up straight up and then along over the top of the rift valley and then down through the middle of it
10518,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley,right,down through the middle of it yes,and then down through the middle of it,uh-huh,right so it's straight up to the rift valley
10519,uh-huh,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley,right,down through the middle of it yes,and then down through the middle of it,uh-huh
10520,now have you got rocks below that,uh-huh,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley,right,down through the middle of it yes,and then down through the middle of it
10521,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh,now have you got rocks below that,uh-huh,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley,right,down through the middle of it yes
10522,uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh,now have you got rocks below that,uh-huh,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley,right
10523,right,uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh,now have you got rocks below that,uh-huh,right so you're you're at the middle of the rift valley
10524,a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line,right,uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh,now have you got rocks below that,uh-huh
10525,right okay,a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line,right,uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh,now have you got rocks below that
10526,missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres,right okay,a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line,right,uh-huh quite a bit below it now you want to go down straight down to about halfway to the rocks and then just miss the rocks on the left-hand side,yeah quite a bit below it uh-huh

10528,right eh you've have you got a stone creek,right,missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres,right okay,a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line,right
10529,eh no,right eh you've have you got a stone creek,right,missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres,right okay,a sort of miss them by go a diagonal line straight down in a diagonal line
10530,no you've not right,eh no,right eh you've have you got a stone creek,right,missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres,right okay
10531,ehm there's like to the left of the rocks there's rapids and then like below the rocks there's an outlaws' hideout,no you've not right,eh no,right eh you've have you got a stone creek,right,missing the rocks by a couple of centimetres
10532,uh-huh well straight across from the rocks on the left i've got the stone creek so what you want to do is you want to keep going down the same direction you're going,ehm there's like to the left of the rocks there's rapids and then like below the rocks there's an outlaws' hideout,no you've not right,eh no,right eh you've have you got a stone creek,right
10533,uh-huh,uh-huh well straight across from the rocks on the left i've got the stone creek so what you want to do is you want to keep going down the same direction you're going,ehm there's like to the left of the rocks there's rapids and then like below the rocks there's an outlaws' hideout,no you've not right,eh no,right eh you've have you got a stone creek

10583,right,just a straight line down,right,uh-huh go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it,yeah uh-huh,and then just go straight down have you got the noose
10584,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond,right,just a straight line down,right,uh-huh go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it,yeah uh-huh
10585,no,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond,right,just a straight line down,right,uh-huh go go just go straight down from there so you're eh at the bottom of the noose on the right-hand side of it
10586,you've not got the swan pond,no,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond,right,just a straight line down,right
10587,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else,you've not got the swan pond,no,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond,right,just a straight line down
10588,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else,you've not got the swan pond,no,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond,right
10589,uh-huh,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else,you've not got the swan pond,no,right now you want to curve down have you got the swan pond
10590,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left,uh-huh,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else,you've not got the swan pond,no
10591,right,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left,uh-huh,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else,you've not got the swan pond
10592,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar,right,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left,uh-huh,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar,there's just a noose and then like to the left there's stone creek and below that there's a saloon bar but nothing else
10593,right right,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar,right,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left,uh-huh,aye right the saloon bar right well basically from the noose you're wanting to get to underneath the saloon bar
10594,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much,right right,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar,right,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left,uh-huh
10595,right,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much,right right,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar,right,what you've got to do is ehm drop from the the noose in a sort of curve to your left
10596,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round,right,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much,right right,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar,right
10597,mmhmm,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round,right,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much,right right,so that you're just about the level at the top of the saloon bar
10598,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down,mmhmm,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round,right,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much,right right
10599,right so so should i be ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down,mmhmm,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round,right,right now just go along a a couple of centimetres not too much
10600,ehm yes you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got,right so so should i be ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down,mmhmm,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round,right
10601,right right okay,ehm yes you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got,right so so should i be ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down,mmhmm,and and curve curve up and then back down so you're ah you've not got the swan pond of course see i've got a swan pond there you need to go up over and round
10602,right from there you just want to go eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar,right right okay,ehm yes you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got,right so so should i be ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down,mmhmm
10603,right,right from there you just want to go eh curves you're underneath the saloon bar,right right okay,ehm yes you go underneath the saloon bar and finish to the to the left of it yeah so from from here you want to go up in a curve and then back down so you're at the same level you were originally avoiding the swan pond that i've got,right so so should i be ehm to the left of the saloon bar yeah when i finish,so you want to be going up up the way slightly and then back down

12052,aye,halfway up the trunk just before the,the dimple uh,yeah you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree you see the dimple in the chestnut tree,so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bottom,right
12053,the branches start,aye,halfway up the trunk just before the,the dimple uh,yeah you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree you see the dimple in the chestnut tree,so i curve round oh so i'm on its left-hand side and i'm out about half an inch bottom
12054,the branches right okay,the branches start,aye,halfway up the trunk just before the,the dimple uh,yeah you go up about half the trunk of the chestnut tree to the dimple in the chestnut tree you see the dimple in the chestnut tree
12055,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long,the branches right okay,the branches start,aye,halfway up the trunk just before the,the dimple uh
12056,so,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long,the branches right okay,the branches start,aye,halfway up the trunk just before the
12057,and that's your finish point,so,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long,the branches right okay,the branches start,aye
12058,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point,and that's your finish point,so,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long,the branches right okay,the branches start
12059,about half an inch,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point,and that's your finish point,so,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long,the branches right okay
12060,above,about half an inch,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point,and that's your finish point,so,you've got that's only about like a centimetre long
12061,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree,above,about half an inch,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point,and that's your finish point,so
12062,yeah,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree,above,about half an inch,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point,and that's your finish point
12063,and you then you go due north,yeah,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree,above,about half an inch,mmhmm so i've taken my i've gone down past spaceship i've curved round to a point
12064,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree,and you then you go due north,yeah,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree,above,about half an inch
12065,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree,and you then you go due north,yeah,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree,above
12066,curve around,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree,and you then you go due north,yeah,no you're you're half an inch from the base of the tree
12067,all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the,curve around,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree,and you then you go due north,yeah
12068,right right and that's it there,all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the,curve around,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree,and you then you go due north
12069,and that's your finish so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start,right right and that's it there,all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the,curve around,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk,oh right i've go to the i go to the base of the tree
12070,uh-huh right,and that's your finish so your the finish point should be level with where the branches start,right right and that's it there,all the way up the tree trunk basically to the stop at the,curve around,from there you half an inch from the base of the tree and then you go north half a way up the the tree trunk

12190,back up,to the left of the carved stones and then sort of go back a bit to the right and you're sort of,right to the left of the carved stones right,come down just after the carved stones,like towards the,right
12191,back towards the right,back up,to the left of the carved stones and then sort of go back a bit to the right and you're sort of,right to the left of the carved stones right,come down just after the carved stones,like towards the
12192,towards the ravine,back towards the right,back up,to the left of the carved stones and then sort of go back a bit to the right and you're sort of,right to the left of the carved stones right,come down just after the carved stones
12193,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine,towards the ravine,back towards the right,back up,to the left of the carved stones and then sort of go back a bit to the right and you're sort of,right to the left of the carved stones right
12194,right okay right,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine,towards the ravine,back towards the right,back up,to the left of the carved stones and then sort of go back a bit to the right and you're sort of
12195,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows,right okay right,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine,towards the ravine,back towards the right,back up
12196,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows,right okay right,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine,towards the ravine,back towards the right
12197,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows,right okay right,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine,towards the ravine
12198,mmhmm,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows,right okay right,curve round to yeah well try and avoid the ravine
12199,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine,mmhmm,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows,right okay right
12200,okay right,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine,mmhmm,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side,and well the graveyard's here so do you have gallows
12201,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that,okay right,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine,mmhmm,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them,right uh-huh they're sort of away over to the left hand side
12202,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that,okay right,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine,mmhmm,yeah okay well say about ehm a centimetre above them
12203,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that,okay right,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine,mmhmm
12204,uh-huh different oh no,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that,okay right,go underneath like where the graveyard is to the diamond mine straight along to the diamond right mine
12205,well we did it reversed,uh-huh different oh no,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that,okay right
12206,so we should have started there,well we did it reversed,uh-huh different oh no,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing,by the way i started at the finish instead of at the start i've just realised that
12207,yeah,so we should have started there,well we did it reversed,uh-huh different oh no,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start,i know 'cause i was just aye just about a couple of minutes ago i saw the start thing
12208,doesn't matter,yeah,so we should have started there,well we did it reversed,uh-huh different oh no,yeah snap anyway and then like after the diamond mine cut up on the left-hand side of it up to the start
12209,well we did it the wrong way round but,doesn't matter,yeah,so we should have started there,well we did it reversed,uh-huh different oh no
12210,right ready,well we did it the wrong way round but,doesn't matter,yeah,so we should have started there,well we did it reversed
12211,yeah,right ready,well we did it the wrong way round but,doesn't matter,yeah,so we should have started there
12212,okay,yeah,right ready,well we did it the wrong way round but,doesn't matter,yeah
12213,okay,okay,yeah,right ready,well we did it the wrong way round but,doesn't matter
12214,go start at start do you have a start,okay,okay,yeah,right ready,well we did it the wrong way round but
12215,yeah,go start at start do you have a start,okay,okay,yeah,right ready
12216,do you have you're at start okay,yeah,go start at start do you have a start,okay,okay,yeah
12217,uh-huh,do you have you're at start okay,yeah,go start at start do you have a start,okay,okay
12218,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump,uh-huh,do you have you're at start okay,yeah,go start at start do you have a start,okay
12219,what way,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump,uh-huh,do you have you're at start okay,yeah,go start at start do you have a start
12220,directly south,what way,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump,uh-huh,do you have you're at start okay,yeah
12221,right,directly south,what way,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump,uh-huh,do you have you're at start okay
12222,say you know,right,directly south,what way,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump,uh-huh
12223,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump,say you know,right,directly south,what way,um alright go directly south but make the shape of a little camel's hump
12224,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump,say you know,right,directly south,what way
12225,like how big's the hump like,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump,say you know,right,directly south
12226,just like a wee little like a little hill,like how big's the hump like,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump,say you know,right
12227,aye but how how long a one,just like a wee little like a little hill,like how big's the hump like,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump,say you know
12228,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to,aye but how how long a one,just like a wee little like a little hill,like how big's the hump like,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches,how far is that how far south before i make a camel's hump
12229,a curve a curvy line,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to,aye but how how long a one,just like a wee little like a little hill,like how big's the hump like,the just just on your way south make a little hump and go down about oh three inches
12230,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches,a curve a curvy line,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to,aye but how how long a one,just like a wee little like a little hill,like how big's the hump like
12231,right okay,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches,a curve a curvy line,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to,aye but how how long a one,just like a wee little like a little hill
12232,then go,right okay,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches,a curve a curvy line,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to,aye but how how long a one
12233,one two,then go,right okay,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches,a curve a curvy line,just like the well the three inch line going south should just be like a little just have a little a hump to
12234,east about two inches,one two,then go,right okay,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches,a curve a curvy line
12235,east,east about two inches,one two,then go,right okay,it does pardon yeah yeah sort of well well just with one but i i guess it doesn't matter so just go down south about three inches
12236,mm,east,east about two inches,one two,then go,right okay
12237,that's right isn't it,mm,east,east about two inches,one two,then go
12238,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch,that's right isn't it,mm,east,east about two inches,one two
12239,oh shit no no,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch,that's right isn't it,mm,east,east about two inches
12240,no,oh shit no no,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch,that's right isn't it,mm,east
12241,well does it go through any obstacles,no,oh shit no no,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch,that's right isn't it,mm
12242,no we're trying to avoid one,well does it go through any obstacles,no,oh shit no no,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch,that's right isn't it
12243,right,no we're trying to avoid one,well does it go through any obstacles,no,oh shit no no,and then go or maybe no just go east about one inch
12244,so,right,no we're trying to avoid one,well does it go through any obstacles,no,oh shit no no
12245,i think right,so,right,no we're trying to avoid one,well does it go through any obstacles,no
12246,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone,i think right,so,right,no we're trying to avoid one,well does it go through any obstacles
12247,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone,i think right,so,right,no we're trying to avoid one
12248,we'll see okay because,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone,i think right,so,right
12249,to the right i mean,we'll see okay because,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone,i think right,so
12250,yeah to the right,to the right i mean,we'll see okay because,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone,i think right
12251,okay,yeah to the right,to the right i mean,we'll see okay because,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left,there so what we want to do now well we should have gone
12252,yeah,okay,yeah to the right,to the right i mean,we'll see okay because,well one and a half inches along that would be better right to the left
12253,right okay that's done,yeah,okay,yeah to the right,to the right i mean,we'll see okay because
12254,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that,right okay that's done,yeah,okay,yeah to the right,to the right i mean
12255,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that,right okay that's done,yeah,okay,yeah to the right
12256,carpenter,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that,right okay that's done,yeah,okay
12257,yeah so have i,carpenter,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that,right okay that's done,yeah
12258,okay,yeah so have i,carpenter,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that,right okay that's done
12259,right okay,okay,yeah so have i,carpenter,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle,but so now we want to go um diagonally northeast and sort of avoid the obstacle on the right so you should be on the outside of that
12260,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that,right okay,okay,yeah so have i,carpenter,yeah have you got a name written on it that wee obstacle
12261,no that's different in mine,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that,right okay,okay,yeah so have i,carpenter
12262,okay anyway,no that's different in mine,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that,right okay,okay,yeah so have i
12263,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like,okay anyway,no that's different in mine,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that,right okay,okay
12264,north yeah,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like,okay anyway,no that's different in mine,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that,right okay
12265,northeast diagonal how long,north yeah,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like,okay anyway,no that's different in mine,and so now we're right below the green bay do you have that
12266,yeah about two inches maybe,northeast diagonal how long,north yeah,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like,okay anyway,no that's different in mine
12267,right okay,yeah about two inches maybe,northeast diagonal how long,north yeah,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like,okay anyway
12268,i don't know really inches that well,right okay,yeah about two inches maybe,northeast diagonal how long,north yeah,right wait a minute right hang on right diagonal sort of like
12269,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's,i don't know really inches that well,right okay,yeah about two inches maybe,northeast diagonal how long,north yeah
12270,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's,i don't know really inches that well,right okay,yeah about two inches maybe,northeast diagonal how long
12271,yeah,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's,i don't know really inches that well,right okay,yeah about two inches maybe
12272,so,yeah,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's,i don't know really inches that well,right okay
12273,along to some trees maybe roughly,so,yeah,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's,i don't know really inches that well
12274,yeah,along to some trees maybe roughly,so,yeah,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east,well yeah just sort of roughly right okay that's
12275,right,yeah,along to some trees maybe roughly,so,yeah,okay so now we want to go to the right which is to the east
12276,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches,right,yeah,along to some trees maybe roughly,so,yeah
12277,right,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches,right,yeah,along to some trees maybe roughly,so
12278,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees,right,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches,right,yeah,along to some trees maybe roughly
12279,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees,right,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches,right,yeah
12280,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees,right,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches,right
12281,right,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees,right,well we want to of this is what i okay well let's see we want to go east east about two inches
12282,and then,right,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees,right
12283,how how long do you want that diagonal to be,and then,right,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them,and then sort of slope down about two inches and approach the left of these trees
12284,ah well it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half,how how long do you want that diagonal to be,and then,right,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees,right to sort of cut from above the trees to cut in to the left of them
12285,right an inch and a half,ah well it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half,how how long do you want that diagonal to be,and then,right,to to come in below yeah yeah the left of the trees
12286,so it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slope,right an inch and a half,ah well it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half,how how long do you want that diagonal to be,and then,right
12287,"so almost like half a ""zed"" shape you know like a letter ""zed""",so it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slope,right an inch and a half,ah well it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half,how how long do you want that diagonal to be,and then
12288,mmhmm,"so almost like half a ""zed"" shape you know like a letter ""zed""",so it it doesn't go directly from it's sort of like more like a slope,right an inch and a half,ah well it has to go east right about two inches and then come down about an inch and a half,how how long do you want that diagonal to be

12296,so now there's another little obstacle,right,so now so alright here we are,to me eh,"""zed"" okay","yeah i mean ""zed"""
12297,yeah,so now there's another little obstacle,right,so now so alright here we are,to me eh,"""zed"" okay"
12298,and ah,yeah,so now there's another little obstacle,right,so now so alright here we are,to me eh
12299,oh trees,and ah,yeah,so now there's another little obstacle,right,so now so alright here we are
12300,well well there were trees that we just,oh trees,and ah,yeah,so now there's another little obstacle,right
12301,yeah,well well there were trees that we just,oh trees,and ah,yeah,so now there's another little obstacle
12302,got by and now,yeah,well well there were trees that we just,oh trees,and ah,yeah
12303,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them,got by and now,yeah,well well there were trees that we just,oh trees,and ah
12304,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them,got by and now,yeah,well well there were trees that we just,oh trees
12305,right okay,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them,got by and now,yeah,well well there were trees that we just
12306,but now is there something even right below the trees,right okay,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them,got by and now,yeah
12307,no there isn't,but now is there something even right below the trees,right okay,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them,got by and now
12308,okay well,no there isn't,but now is there something even right below the trees,right okay,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be,i'm well i'm not quite beyond well i'm just about at the bottom of them
12309,there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called fields,okay well,no there isn't,but now is there something even right below the trees,right okay,yeah yeah that's exactly where you should be
12310,yeah that's we're above there we're halfway okay we're right at the bottom of the trees right,there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called fields,okay well,no there isn't,but now is there something even right below the trees,right okay
12311,uh-huh,yeah that's we're above there we're halfway okay we're right at the bottom of the trees right,there's a there's a bit a couple of bits down called fields,okay well,no there isn't,but now is there something even right below the trees

12425,oh right,okay 'cause that's where we're is do you have a an that's where we're supposed to finish,you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side,yeah yeah yeah,yeah see see the attractive cliffs and chestnut tree are sort of in a straight well not really a straight line but one under the other,on the left of the chestnut tree
12426,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about,oh right,okay 'cause that's where we're is do you have a an that's where we're supposed to finish,you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side,yeah yeah yeah,yeah see see the attractive cliffs and chestnut tree are sort of in a straight well not really a straight line but one under the other
12427,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about,oh right,okay 'cause that's where we're is do you have a an that's where we're supposed to finish,you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side,yeah yeah yeah
12428,okay,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about,oh right,okay 'cause that's where we're is do you have a an that's where we're supposed to finish,you've got a crashed space crashed spaceship on the left-hand side
12429,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs,okay,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about,oh right,okay 'cause that's where we're is do you have a an that's where we're supposed to finish
12430,mm,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs,okay,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about,oh right
12431,bit,mm,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs,okay,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm,so what you do if you're at the edge of the paper just drop down about
12432,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper,bit,mm,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs,okay,i'm not at the edge i've i've got about an inch and a half to go i'm
12433,right,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper,bit,mm,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs,okay
12434,and then you drop down about an inch and a half,right,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper,bit,mm,just above i've just come through the attractive cliffs
12435,uh-huh,and then you drop down about an inch and a half,right,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper,bit,mm
12436,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up,uh-huh,and then you drop down about an inch and a half,right,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper,bit
12437,what right,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up,uh-huh,and then you drop down about an inch and a half,right,okay so another like very very slight slope to the left 'til you're about like a half uh a quarter of an inch away from the paper
12438,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree",what right,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up,uh-huh,and then you drop down about an inch and a half,right
12439,oh,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree",what right,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up,uh-huh,and then you drop down about an inch and a half
12440,you're making me pick my nose,oh,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree",what right,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up,uh-huh
12441,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit,you're making me pick my nose,oh,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree",what right,then you go to the right about an inch and a little bloop up
12442,yeah just,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit,you're making me pick my nose,oh,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree",what right
12443,like what we did round the fields,yeah just,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit,you're making me pick my nose,oh,"then you just go bloop and like about tiny tiny bit up and draw an ""x"" and we're done it should be right to the left of the chestnut tree"
12444,sort of but very very,like what we did round the fields,yeah just,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit,you're making me pick my nose,oh
12445,earlier on,sort of but very very,like what we did round the fields,yeah just,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit,you're making me pick my nose
12446,no it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came to,earlier on,sort of but very very,like what we did round the fields,yeah just,well we we might be in the chestnut trees might be in different position is it a bloop like a kind of round bit
12447,what to the left or to the right,no it's like it's so slight it's only like it's less than a quarter of an inch 'cause you just came to,earlier on,sort of but very very,like what we did round the fields,yeah just

12457,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got,okay so,where do and i'm just above the spaceship right,so how how,just over half an inch three quarters of an inch right,mmhmm
12458,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got,okay so,where do and i'm just above the spaceship right,so how how,just over half an inch three quarters of an inch right
12459,no it's just above the tree,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got,okay so,where do and i'm just above the spaceship right,so how how
12460,oh no you should be,no it's just above the tree,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got,okay so,where do and i'm just above the spaceship right
12461,it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree,oh no you should be,no it's just above the tree,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got,okay so
12462,"okay well just just go to the right about an inch and then draw an ""x"" and we'll be done",it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree,oh no you should be,no it's just above the tree,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree,so where do you want do you want me to bloop round this round what i've got
12463,right,"okay well just just go to the right about an inch and then draw an ""x"" and we'll be done",it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree,oh no you should be,no it's just above the tree,is the eh is the spaceship right to the left of the tree
12464,i got to see your map,right,"okay well just just go to the right about an inch and then draw an ""x"" and we'll be done",it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree,oh no you should be,no it's just above the tree

12504,yeah it's way above though,have you got this granite quarry,okay,you should have above you a granite quarry,okay,right okay now have you got there's a 'til you're just sort of right if you turn right and continue along horizontally for about six inches
12505,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up,yeah it's way above though,have you got this granite quarry,okay,you should have above you a granite quarry,okay
12506,okay mmhmm okay,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up,yeah it's way above though,have you got this granite quarry,okay,you should have above you a granite quarry
12507,towards towards the granite quarry,okay mmhmm okay,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up,yeah it's way above though,have you got this granite quarry,okay
12508,okay,towards towards the granite quarry,okay mmhmm okay,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up,yeah it's way above though,have you got this granite quarry
12509,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry,okay,towards towards the granite quarry,okay mmhmm okay,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up,yeah it's way above though
12510,yeah,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry,okay,towards towards the granite quarry,okay mmhmm okay,yeah so that's okay it's supposed to be you're sort of you're you're level with the adventure playground but you have to right wait a minute go along about six inches from the adventure playground and then directly up
12511,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way,yeah,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry,okay,towards towards the granite quarry,okay mmhmm okay
12512,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way,yeah,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry,okay,towards towards the granite quarry
12513,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way,yeah,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry,okay
12514,no,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way,yeah,and sort of turn right wait a minute you just sort of the right-hand side of the granite quarry can you go right up above the granite quarry
12515,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry,no,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way,yeah
12516,okay,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry,no,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry,and then back down again i don't have you got any obstacles in your way
12517,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing,okay,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry,no,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you,ah right like directly diagonal from the adventure playground i've privately owned fields about four inches under the granite quarry
12518,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing,okay,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry,no,mmhmm mmhmm but you haven't gone through them have you
12519,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing,okay,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry,no
12520,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing,okay,okay right so if you continue going right up above the granite quarry
12521,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing,okay
12522,okay,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so,you should come to a train crossing do you have the train crossing
12523,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no,okay,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map,ah yeah but it's up on the far left of my paper so
12524,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no,okay,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry,oh oh right there's actually two on mine so if you uh you should have a granite quarry and then a waterfall well that's what i've got on my map
12525,mmhmm oh no,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no,okay,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map,yeah i have a waterfall to the left of the granite quarry
12526,for around two inches or what should i have done,mmhmm oh no,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no,okay,yeah but on this map there's a train crossing so if you could come down you go up above the granite quarry and then back down again but not too far otherwise you'll pass through the train crossing in my map
12527,you should have gone to the left,for around two inches or what should i have done,mmhmm oh no,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no,okay
12528,okay,you should have gone to the left,for around two inches or what should i have done,mmhmm oh no,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right,so if you keep going along just about half an inch below the waterfall and right up to the left no
12529,sorry towards the waterfall sorry,okay,you should have gone to the left,for around two inches or what should i have done,mmhmm oh no,right what i did at the top of the granite quarry was i made a right
12530,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go,sorry towards the waterfall sorry,okay,you should have gone to the left,for around two inches or what should i have done,mmhmm oh no
12531,about couple of about half a centimetre,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go,sorry towards the waterfall sorry,okay,you should have gone to the left,for around two inches or what should i have done
12532,and then go left,about couple of about half a centimetre,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go,sorry towards the waterfall sorry,okay,you should have gone to the left
12533,yeah sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall just if you keep about two centimetres below the the writing that says waterfall,and then go left,about couple of about half a centimetre,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go,sorry towards the waterfall sorry,okay
12534,do you okay keep below it,yeah sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall just if you keep about two centimetres below the the writing that says waterfall,and then go left,about couple of about half a centimetre,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go,sorry towards the waterfall sorry
12535,mmhmm not too far though,do you okay keep below it,yeah sort of over the granite quarry in the direction of the waterfall just if you keep about two centimetres below the the writing that says waterfall,and then go left,about couple of about half a centimetre,that's okay so then okay how far above the granite quarry should i go
