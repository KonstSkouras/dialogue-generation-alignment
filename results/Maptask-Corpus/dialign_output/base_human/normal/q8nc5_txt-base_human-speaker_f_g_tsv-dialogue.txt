B|4| g: _right_ _okay_ _ehm_ _right_ _you're going_ _to_ start coming _down_ _but_ _but_ as _you_ come _down_ _you're_ _you_ _curve_ _to the right_ 
A|5| f: [to the right] 
B|6| g: [uh-huh] _just_ _just_ _below the burnt forest_ without _touching_ _the burnt forest_ 
A|7| f: [right] _how_ _far_ 
B|8| g: [right] _you're_ _what_ _you're going_ [to] _do_ _is_ _you're going_ [to] _curve_ _to the right and then back_ _left_ _okay_ _so_ _that_ when _you_ come _you're going_ [to] be _about_ three [to] four inches _below_ directly _below_ start 
A|9| f: [uh-huh] 
B|10| g: understand _what_ _i mean_ _so it's not_ _going_ [to] _it's_ _it's not_ _going_ [to] be _a_ _straight_ line _it's_ _going_ [to] be _a curve_ 
A|11| f: [have you] [not] [got] [have you] [not] [got the] carpenter's cottage 
B|12| g: _no_ 
A|13| f: _how_ _how_ _far_ [below the burnt forest] [do] [i] _go_ [do] [i] _go _right_ _along_ the_ beneath _it_ before [i] [curve] 
B|14| g: _no_ [you] _just_ _see_ [how] 
A|15| f: [i] [just] _go_ past _it_ 
B|16| g: [uh-huh] [you] [just] 
A|17| f: [so it's] only _a slight curve_ 
B|18| g: [uh-huh] [it's] [just] [a slight curve] 
A|19| f: [to the right _and then back] to the left_ 
B|20| g: [uh-huh] [and then back to the left] 
A|21| f: [right] [uh-huh] 
B|22| g: _okay_ [so] _you're_ _about_ _eh_ three [to] four inches [below] start [then] directly underneath 
A|23| f: mm _mmhmm_ 
B|24| g: [right] _okay_ [so] _you're going_ [to] _in a_ _straight_ line [go] [go] [to the _right] _have you got_ _the_ ravine_

B|26| g: [right] _going_ [to] [go] _straight_ [along] _ehm_ say _about_ _along to the right_ leaving _about an inch_ _about an inch_ _from_ _the ravine_ 
A|27| f: _below it_ 
B|28| g: [uh-huh] [then] _you're going_ [to] _eh_ slope _up [to the_ _right] eh_ oh [uh-huh] _to the left _of the_ ravine_ _you're going_ [to] slope _up_ [go] _above _the_ top _of_ the ravine_ 
A|29| f: _right so_ [i] _go [along_ to the right] 
B|30| g: [mmhmm] 
A|31| f: _until_ _i'm_ [about an inch] [below [the] ravine] [but] _to the left of it_ 
B|32| g: _uh-huh uh-huh_

B|48| g: [but] _you're_ [about] [you] _know_ _you're_ [not] _in_ near [the] _you're_ [not] [at [the] pine grove] yet 
A|49| f: [okay] 
B|50| g: [so] _you're_ [about an inch] [and] [a] half _from_ [the pine grove] _you're going_ [to] _your_ line _is_ _going_ [to] slope _down_ [to the right] [but] _you're going_ [to] keep [to _the] left-hand side _of the_ pine grove_ [i'm] [not] making this very easy _am i_ [right] 
A|51| f: [okay] [mmhmm]

A|67| f: [mmhmm] 
B|68| g: [okay] moving _down_ _all_ [the] time 
A|69| f: [along] [what] _along [the_ bottom] [of the pine grove] _or_ [going] past [it]

A|73| f: _where_ [do] [i] end [up] [in] relation _to the concealed hideout_ 
B|74| g: [right] [what] happens _is_ _you go_ [you] [curve] [to the right and then back] into [the left] [and then] [you] [curve] [to the right] again _along the top of_ this [concealed hideout] 
A|75| f: [but] [i] [i] [don't _go] along [the_ bottom] [of the pine grove] 
B|76| g: [no]

B|78| g: [no] 
A|79| f: [right eh] [and] [i] end [up _to the] left of the concealed hideout_ 
B|80| g: [no] _you're going_ _you're going_ [to] [go] _to the right of the concealed hideout_ _you're going_ [to] [go _along the] top_ [to the right] 
A|81| f: [along the top _of] it_ [right] 
B|82| g: [mmhmm] 
A|83| f: [okay]

B|146| g: [which] [is] [where] [is] [it] [on] _your_ map 
A|147| f: [it's] _good [bit_ further] [down] opposite [the] other [boat house] [but] [further] [down] 
B|148| g: oh [you've got] another [boat house] 
A|149| f: ah [you] still [i] still [don't] [know] [where] [your] [boat house is]
