B|0| g: _okay_ start off _above _the_ diamond mine_ 
A|1| f: [okay] _yeah_ 
B|2| g: _right_ _now_ _go_ _south_ _from_ _the diamond mine_ until _you_ are _just_ _above the_ _desert_ 
A|3| f: _so that's_ _with [the_ diamond mine] _on_ _on_ _your right_ 
B|4| g: [that's] [that's] correct _uh-huh_ _and go _below the_ diamond mine_ 
A|5| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|6| g: _and_ _below the_ _graveyard_ _below the_ _graveyard_ _but_ _above _the_ carved wooden pole_ 
A|7| f: _oh_ hang _on_ _i _don't have a_ graveyard_

B|12| g: [to] [your right] _uh-huh_ 
A|13| f: _right so_ _i_ _continue_ [and go below _the] _fast_ running creek_ 
B|14| g: _no_ [go] _just_ until _you_ [go] [go _below the] diamond mine_ until _just_ _before_ [the fast] _fast flowing river_ 
A|15| f: _i don't [have a fast_ flowing river] 
B|16| g: _you [have_ a fast flowing] [creek] 
A|17| f: _i've_ [a fast flowing] _running creek_ _which_ _is_ _on_ [the] far right-hand corner

A|33| f: [okay so] _i'm_ _still_ [below the diamond mine] 
B|34| g: [right] [you] _uh-huh_ [below the diamond mine] 
A|35| f: [right okay] 
B|36| g: _and then_ [go] [to] [your right]

A|71| f: [between] them 
B|72| g: _uh-huh_ [so that's] _over the_ top _of _the_ walled city_ 
A|73| f: [right okay]
