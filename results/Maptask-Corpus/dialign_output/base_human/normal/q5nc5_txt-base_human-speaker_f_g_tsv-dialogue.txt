B|0| g: _right_ see _the_ start 
A|1| f: _you_ _got_ _to_ say _sarah and danielle_ 
B|2| g: _oh_ _aye_ [sarah and danielle] 
A|3| f: [right] 
B|4| g: [right] see _the_ start 
A|5| f: it's _above_ _the diamond mine_ 
B|6| g: [right] 
A|7| f: [right] 
B|8| g: _okay_ _i_ want [you] _go_ _down_ about three inches 
A|9| f: _where_ [down] _past the diamond mine_ 
B|10| g: _yeah_ 
A|11| f: [right] 
B|12| g: _just_ [down] at [the] _side_ _just_ straight [down] 
A|13| f: [okay] 
B|14| g: _and then go_ _round_ in _a curve_ underneath [the diamond mine] 
A|15| f: [right] mm 
B|16| g: _then_ [you] want [to] start like carry _on_ that _curve_ for about four or five inches _just_ gradually _heading_ _up the_ _way_ [right] 
A|17| f: _so_ i'm making [a _curve] _round_ [the_ diamond mine] [yeah] 
B|18| g: _no no no no_ 
A|19| f: [no no no no] 
B|20| g: [past the diamond mine] not that not that steep [a curve] like _just_ 
A|21| f: pass _it_ [yeah] [just] slightly 
B|22| g: [just] like [just] more [a] wee bit more than [a] straight line along [past the diamond mine] 
A|23| f: [yeah] [right] [okay] [right] 
B|24| g: _i_ _i_ _don't_ suppose you've _got a_ graveyard _have_ [you] 
A|25| f: _ehm_ [no] 
B|26| g: [no] [right] 
A|27| f: [got a] _fast_ running _creek and_ _canoes_ [and] things 
B|28| g: _yeah okay_ _what_ [you] want [to] do is is [you] want [to] be sort _of_ like _going_ _up_ _and then_ curving [right] [round the] [fast] flowing [creek] 
A|29| f: [what] [round] [up _the] top of_ _it_ 
B|30| g: [yeah] _over the top_ 
A|31| f: [right] 
B|32| g: [and] [down] _the right-hand side_ 
A|33| f: [the right-hand side] 
B|34| g: [right] 
A|35| f: [yeah] 
B|36| g: see your _apache_ camp 
A|37| f: [yeah] 
B|38| g: [right] head [down] towards that _and then_ [just] [curve] [down] [the] _left-hand side_ that 
A|39| f: _so_ i'm bypassing _canoes_ [yeah] 
B|40| g: [canoes] 
A|41| f: [oh] _well_ maybe [you] [don't] [have] canoe 
B|42| g: [no] i've [no] [got] any [canoes] 
A|43| f: [right] [okay] _left-hand side _of the_ apache_ 
B|44| g: do [you] see [the] carved wooden pole 
A|45| f: _ehm_ [no] [don't] [have] one 
B|46| g: [no] [you] see [the] walled city 
A|47| f: [yeah] 
B|48| g: [right] [well] when [you] when you're _coming_ [down] [the] [left-hand] [of the apache] camp [just] keep _heading_ along [and] _go_ _over [the top_ [of] the] walled city 
A|49| f: [over the top] [okay] 
B|50| g: [okay] _and then_ [just] like [a] nice big [curve] _heading down_ about six inches 
A|51| f: mmhmm _now_ _where_ which [way] am [i] [heading down] 
B|52| g: [you] see [the] carved wooden pole at [the] bottom 
A|53| f: [aye] 
B|54| g: [well] [you] [you] need [to] be about two inch [you] [you] need [to] end [up] about two inches _from the top_ there 
A|55| f: [from the top] 
B|56| g: two inches _above it_ 
A|57| f: [and] it's [on] [the] left [well] i'm [coming] [from the] left _to go_ [to] [above it] 
B|58| g: [yeah] 
A|59| f: [right] 
B|60| g: sort [of] curving [round] [now] see _stone creek_ 
A|61| f: [yeah] 
B|62| g: [right] you're [just] [heading] along [past] that [you] see [the] _flat rocks_ 
A|63| f: [no] 
B|64| g: [no] 
A|65| f: [no] 
B|66| g: great [ehm] [okay] head [up] [ehm] [past] _stone creek_ [you] need [to] be _going_ at about [up] curving [up] [to] [the] [right] at about [a] forty-five degree angle 
A|67| f: _so_ i'm _going _over_ stone creek_ 
B|68| g: [aye] 
A|69| f: [well] [above it] anyway [on] [no] wait [a] minute [i] [have] [got] [flat rocks] 
B|70| g: [right] [you] [well] [right] you're [going] [past] you're [going] [up] [over stone [creek] and] your line's [just] about touching [where] [flat rocks] is written 
A|71| f: [yeah okay] 
B|72| g: [so] that's [where] [you] want [to] end [up] 
A|73| f: _right right_ 
B|74| g: [now] keep [heading] [to] [the] [right] [a] bit 
A|75| f: mmhmm 
B|76| g: further until you're about an inch away [from the] edge [of the] paper 
A|77| f: _right right_ 
B|78| g: [right] see [the] buffalo 
A|79| f: mmhmm 
B|80| g: ah [right right] head [down] [the] [right] sand hand [side of the] paper [and] [curve] underneath [the] buffalo 
A|81| f: [yeah] [right] 
B|82| g: do [you] see [a] cattle ranch [no] 
A|83| f: nope 
B|84| g: [right] [ehm] [you] see that _fort_ 
A|85| f: mmhmm 
B|86| g: away at [the] other [side] [right] you're [heading] [to _go] under_ that but like [on] your [way] about halfway between [the] buffalo [and] _the fort_ there's [a] wee blip in your line 
A|87| f: mmhmm 
B|88| g: like you're [going [over] the top] something _and then_ [coming] back [down] [and] [going] _under the fort_ 
A|89| f: [yeah] 
B|90| g: [so] [just] do that 
A|91| f: [right] [and then [go] [under] the fort] 
B|92| g: [right] [where] are [you] [now] [then] 
A|93| f: i'm [under the fort] 
B|94| g: [right] [you] [just] want [to] [curve] [up the] [left-hand side of [the] fort] [just] [curve] [a] nice big [curve round] [it] 
A|95| f: mmhmm 
B|96| g: [and] that's [it] you're finished
