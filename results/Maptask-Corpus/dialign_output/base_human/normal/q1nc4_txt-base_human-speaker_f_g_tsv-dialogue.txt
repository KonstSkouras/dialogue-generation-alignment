B|0| g: _right_ _so_ _the start_ _is_ _at the top_ left-hand side _of the page_ 
A|1| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|2| g: do _you_ _have_ _cliffs_ _just_ _to_ _to the right_ 
A|3| f: [to the right] _uh-huh_ sandstone [cliffs] 
B|4| g: _mmhmm_ do _you_ _have a forge_ below [the] [cliffs] _about_ _you_ know _an inch_ or _so_ _down_ two inches maybe 
A|5| f: _er_ _no_ 
B|6| g: _you_ _don't have a forge_ well [the] _forge_ _is_ eh below [the] [the] [cliffs] _say_ _about_ two inches _down_ _okay_ _so_ _you_ _go_ _from _the_ start_ slightly [to] _your_ [right] _down_ [the] way [right] _a_ curve 
A|7| f: _uh-huh_ _how far down_ 
B|8| g: [to the] bottom _of the_ [cliffs] 
A|9| f: [right] 
B|10| g: _and_ then _you_ _start_ [to] _go_ _left_ _go_ _about_ _half_ _an inch_ out _to the left_ _and_ _and_ [down] _about_ _you_ know two _and a half_ inches three inches 
A|11| f: [so] _how far_ am _i_ [from _the] left [of_ the page] 
B|12| g: _an inch and a half_ _if you_ draw _that_ line [down] you'll be _on_ [the] left-hand side [of the] _forge_ _you_ _don't have a forge_ but there _is_ one there 
A|13| f: [right] 
B|14| g: [so] _now_ you're _about_ 
A|15| f: _no_ hold [on] [a] minute 
B|16| g: _you_ should really end _up_ _about_ four inches [down] [from the] [the] cross [er] _you_ know _in the_ same line like _just_ beneath it _in_ fact four inches [down] _okay_ 
A|17| f: [right] hold [on] wait [a] minute am _i_ [right] _under the_ sandstone [cliffs] 
B|18| g: [no] [no] 
A|19| f: [no] 
B|20| g: [no] [the] initial line [from the] cross 
A|21| f: [mmhmm] 
B|22| g: goes [right] but it doesn't _go_ _as far_ _right _as_ the_ [cliffs] 
A|23| f: [right] [okay] 
B|24| g: it goes [down] [to] _where_ it says [cliffs] [okay] 
A|25| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|26| g: _about_ [a] centimetre [from] _where_ it says [cliffs] [to the] left-hand side [of] it [okay] then _you_ _go_ back [left] slightly until you're beneath [the] _the start_ _and_ [down] _you_ know two or three inches until you're 
A|27| f: [right] straight [down] _under [the_ start] 
B|28| g: _yeah_ 
A|29| f: [right] 
B|30| g: until you're _about_ _you_ know four inches or four _and a half_ inches or [so] [down] [from [the] start] 
A|31| f: [okay] 
B|32| g: do _you_ _have_ _an_ old _pine_ 
A|33| f: _uh-huh_ [in [the] right] _kind of_ towards [the] middle _a bit_ 
B|34| g: _yeah_ [a] single old _pine_ 
A|35| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|36| g: _and_ [down] [down] _as far as_ _that_ [okay] 
A|37| f: [right] 
B|38| g: but _you_ know beneath [the start] 
A|39| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|40| g: [so] then _you_ _go right_ which would be [under the] _forge_ _and_ _you_ _go_ _up over the_ old _pine_ [okay] 
A|41| f: [right] [right] [up _over the] pine_ 
B|42| g: [over the pine] 
A|43| f: [and] _i_ [go [right] [as] far [as] [the] pine] 
B|44| g: _yeah_ more or less 
A|45| f: [if _you] see what i_ mean 
B|46| g: [as] [as] long [as] [you] avoid [the] _forge_ [and] [the pine] [you] [you] _don't have_ [to] 
A|47| f: _oh_ 
B|48| g: worry too much _about_ [the] exact 
A|49| f: [okay] _i [don't have a_ forge] _anyway_ 
B|50| g: route but eh 
A|51| f: [right] [up] 
B|52| g: [right] [so] once you're _at the top_ [of [the] pine] [if you] [go] _about_ two _and a half_ inches three inches [to the right] [have] [you] got [a] _pine forest_ 
A|53| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|54| g: [you] [have] well _just go_ [down] [the] left-hand side [of _the] pine forest_ 
A|55| f: am _i_ [and] am _i_ _going_ straight _kind of_ _along_ [the] outline [of _the] bay_ 
B|56| g: you've got [a] [bay] there 
A|57| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|58| g: [i don't have a] [bay] there it'll be _at the top_ 
A|59| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|60| g: [have] [you] got [a] [bay] _at the_ bottom 
A|61| f: [yeah] 
B|62| g: crane [bay] 
A|63| f: _uh-huh_ 
B|64| g: where's [the] one _at the top_ 
A|65| f: _it's _just_ [in_ the] centre [of the page] [at the top] very [top] 
B|66| g: [how far down] 
A|67| f: erm _about an inch and a half_ 
B|68| g: [yeah] well [don't] [go] much [you] know [don't] [go] any higher than than [the] [the] height [of the] old [pine] or or [the] _forest_ _that_ must be _where_ [the bay] _is_ [i don't have a] [bay] there but [the] route [you] know must miss [the bay] [er] [so] [you] know _just go_ [along] 'til [you] get [to _the] pine forest_ more or less [and] then [go] [go] [down] [on] [the] left-hand side [of _the] pine forest_ 
A|69| f: _uh-huh_ [okay] 
B|70| g: [okay] once you're [at the] bottom [of _the] pine forest_ [just] _where_ it says [pine] 
A|71| f: [mmhmm] 
B|72| g: [okay] [if you] [if you] [just] [kind of] draw [a] draw [an] arc [er] [to the right] [just] more or less [the] same direction [as] you've been [going] until [have] [you] got _wheatfields_ 
A|73| f: [no] 
B|74| g: [on] _your_ map [no] well [the] 
A|75| f: _oh_ [yeah] _uh-huh_ 
B|76| g: [you] [have] [right] 
A|77| f: [mmhmm] 
B|78| g: well [just] draw [the] arc [and] stop [the] arc [you] know [in] line with _the wheatfields_ but beneath _the pine forest_ [okay] 
A|79| f: [i don't] understand [say] [that] again 
B|80| g: [oh] two or three inches [down] [from _the] pine forest_ [okay] [you] know it doesn't [have] [to] be [an] arc [as] long [as] [you] avoid all [the] obstacles [i] think eh [if you] [you] know [if you] finish [up] eh [in] line with _the wheatfields_ [okay] but beneath _the pine forest_ [you] [if you] stop drawing _your_ line there above [the] bakery [in] other words above [the] eh 
A|81| f: [where] [is] [your] [wheatfields] 
B|82| g: well [er] [you] know imagine [where] [the] [forge] would be [on] [your] map or [it's] [it's] [on] mine but imagine [where] it would be 
A|83| f: [mmhmm] 
B|84| g: [about] two inches [down] [from] [that] [in] [in] between [the] [the] [forge] [and] [the] old [pine] 
A|85| f: [right] 
B|86| g: [on] [the] left-hand side [okay] [so] [where] are [you] _now_ 
A|87| f: [right] i'm [going] [down] _past [the_ pine forest] [in] [an] arch towards [the wheatfields] 
B|88| g: [mmhmm] [no] [no] [no] 
A|89| f: [no] 
B|90| g: [no] [don't] worry [about] [the wheatfields] [it's just] [to] tell [you] [where] [to] stop [the] line 
A|91| f: [right] [okay] 
B|92| g: never mind [about] it being [an] arc or [a] curve or anything 
A|93| f: [okay] 
B|94| g: [just] _just go_ [down] [the] left-hand side [of [the] pine forest] 
A|95| f: [right] 
B|96| g: _okay and_ once [you] get [to the] [where] it says [pine] draw [a] line [from] there [to] eh above [the] bakery but not [the] chimney [a bit] _to [the left_ of] [that] [in] fact [the] left-hand side it must be [a] wee shed or whatever it [is] 
A|97| f: [right] 
B|98| g: [you see what i] 
A|99| f: [and] i'm [going] am [i] [going] straight [down] 
B|100| g: [yeah] but stop when [you] get [just] [to] above [the] bakery 
A|101| f: _uh-huh_ [right] [okay] 
B|102| g: then _just go_ _round_ [the] bakery [on] [the] right-hand side [just] draw [a] [an] oval shape _round_ [the] right-hand side [of the] bakery 
A|103| f: i'm i'm [going] _down and_ [round] 
B|104| g: [yeah] _right round_ it [uh-huh] 
A|105| f: [uh-huh] [right] [now] [where] 
B|106| g: _underneath the_ bakery 
A|107| f: [uh-huh] 
B|108| g: [have] [you] got [a] canal 
A|109| f: [no] 
B|110| g: [no] well [the] canal [is] [about] two inches [to the] left-hand side [of the] bakery but [it's] [in] line with it [so] once [you] get [an inch] or [and a half] or [so] [past the] bakery 
A|111| f: [mmhmm] 
B|112| g: eh take [your] line [down] [to] crane [bay] [oh] i've got two [wheatfields] that's not important [is] it [right] [anyway] [so] [you] get [to the] canal [right] [you] [don't have] one but _just go_ [down] [about] two inches until [you] get [to] crane [bay] [and] follow follow [the] curve [okay] [of] crane [bay] 
A|113| f: [uh-huh] [right round] [to the left] 
B|114| g: but not [don't] [go] [down] _just go_ [along] [don't] [go] [don't] [go] [down] [where] it it really curves away there [don't] [don't] follow [that] 
A|115| f: [right] [okay] 
B|116| g: [so] you're [at the top] left-hand side [of] crane [bay] [right] [just] northwest [of] [where] it says crane 
A|117| f: [uh-huh] 
B|118| g: "or [the] [where] [the] ""c"" is" 
A|119| f: [uh-huh] 
B|120| g: i've got [wheatfields] [in] line with [where] it says [bay] [okay] [about an inch] or [so] [to [the left] of] crane [bay] itself [just in] line [in] fact beneath [where] [the] other [wheatfields] were [that] [i] [that] [i] was telling [you] [about] 
A|121| f: [mmhmm] [right] [okay] 
B|122| g: [okay] [so] [you] [go] [round] [the] [round] [that] curve [and] [you] [have] [to] [go] [down and] [about an inch and a half] [okay] [to] [to] avoid [the wheatfields] which are [just] [to [the left] of] crane [bay] [so] [you] [go] [down] there [right] 
A|123| f: hmm 
B|124| g: [go] beneath [the wheatfields] [in] other words draw [a] line [you] know two inches or [so] [to the left] [have] [you] got [a] rocket _warehouse_ 
A|125| f: [uh-huh] 
B|126| g: well [just] draw [a] line between well above [the] rocket _warehouse_ [in] fact [okay] 
A|127| f: [uh-huh] 
B|128| g: [an] [an inch] or [so] above [the] rocket _warehouse_ but [to [the left] of] it [go] [round] it [the] same way [as] [you] went [round] [the] igloo but [on] [the] other side [okay] [just] follow it [round] 
A|129| f: [yeah] [okay] 
B|130| g: [go] [down] [the] left-hand side [of the page] once you've done [that] 
A|131| f: [uh-huh] 
B|132| g: [have] [you] got [a] _lighthouse_ 
A|133| f: [yeah] [kind of] directly [underneath the] [warehouse] 
B|134| g: [the] rocket [warehouse] 
A|135| f: [uh-huh] 
B|136| g: [the] cross [is] _right next to the lighthouse_ _and just_ take [your] line [to] there [and] that's it finished 
A|137| f: [it's] [right next to the lighthouse] 
B|138| g: [on] [the] left-hand side [of] it 
A|139| f: [right] [okay [and] [just] go] straight [down] 
B|140| g: well [yeah] [that] would be [okay] 
A|141| f: [uh-huh] 
B|142| g: [uh-huh] [and just] [the] cross [is] [right] [you] know [the] left-hand side [of [the] lighthouse] [just] [next to] it 
A|143| f: [okay] 
B|144| g: [okay] got it 
A|145| f: [mmhmm] 
B|146| g: [right] that's it finished
