B|0| g: _right_ _at the_ very _top of the page_ there's _a_ _cross_ 
A|1| f: yep 
B|2| g: _do you_ _have_ _a diamond mine_ _just _below_ it_ 
A|3| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|4| g: _about_ _an inch to_ _your_ _right_ draw _a_ _line_ _straight down_ 
A|5| f: [right] _start_ _from the_ [cross] _yeah_ 
B|6| g: _'til_ _it's_ _'til_ _it's_ _an inch _below_ _the_ diamond mine_ [right] _do you_ _have_ _a_ 
A|7| f: [it's] _directly_ [down] _yeah_ 
B|8| g: [yeah] _do you_ _have_ _a_ _a_ _wagon wheel_ _just _to_ the right of the_ _the diamond mine_ 
A|9| f: mm _no_ _i_ haven't _got_ any [wagon wheel] 
B|10| g: what's [the] next _thing_ _to_ _its_ [right] 
A|11| f: [to the right] _i've got_ eventually [a] cactus 
B|12| g: _you_ _don't_ _have_ _a rift valley_ 
A|13| f: _oh_ _i've got [a_ rift valley] _above_ _that_ 
B|14| g: [yeah] _okay_ 
A|15| f: _you've got_ _the rift valley _right_ up_ [at _the] top_ _right-hand side_ 
B|16| g: you're drawing _your_ _line_ [down] 
A|17| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|18| g: _underneath_ draw [a] _line_ [to] _your_ _right and_ _straight_ along [at] _a slight_ angle rising _up _towards_ the_ _back_ _of the_ _corner _of the_ page_ 
A|19| f: [towards the] _right-hand_ [corner] 
B|20| g: [yeah] 
A|21| f: _ehm_ _that's_ _going to_ _take_ _me_ pretty near [to the] cactus [thing] _so_ i'm trying _to avoid that_ 
B|22| g: [right] 
A|23| f: hang _on_ hang _on_ [right] [an inch [to] the right of [the] diamond mine] 
B|24| g: [yeah] 
A|25| f: [yeah] _and then_ _straight down to_ [an inch [below] it] 
B|26| g: _should be_ _now_ [yeah] _if_ _your_ line's _below [the_ diamond mine] _you_ _should be_ _okay_ 
A|27| f: [yeah] 
B|28| g: [and then] _go_ [straight] along [to] _my_ [right] _which_ _is_ _your_ [right] _as well_ _go_ [straight] along [to the right] 
A|29| f: [okay] [to] [right] [to the] edge [of the page] 
B|30| g: [no] [to] _about_ halfway [to] [page] _about_ four _inches_ off before [the page] 
A|31| f: er _right okay_ _that_ takes _me_ [to] 
B|32| g: [then] _go_ [up] [to] _almost_ [the] very _top of the page_ 
A|33| f: [okay] 
B|34| g: _right [and_ then] [to] _your_ [right] _again_ 
A|35| f: [okay] hang _on_ 
B|36| g: _well_ _but_ 
A|37| f: [have] _you got_ _the rift valley_ _there_ _'cause_ _i've got_ _the rift valley _right_ up_ _in that_ [top] _right-hand_ [corner] 
B|38| g: [yeah] you're [going to] actually _go _through the_ rift valley_ _like_ [the rift] valley's _like_ _a half_ moon 
A|39| f: [yeah] 
B|40| g: you're [going _to] go_ [and] you're [going _to] _come_ right_ _through_ you're [going to] _like_ intersect [right] _almost_ [at the] midpoint [of [the] rift valley] 
A|41| f: [right] [go through the] centre i'll [just] _take it_ [up] [and] [go through the] centre [yeah] 
B|42| g: "yeah _like_ [right] [through the] sort [of] midpoint _like_ [through the] [it's] _like_ [a] _""u""_ [and] you're [going] [right] [through the] midpoint _you want_ _to be_ [down] into _the ""u""_ _as_ though [you] were [going] _if _you_ _know_ what i_ mean" 
A|43| f: _right okay_ erm i'm _not_ _that so_ [i] [should be] [below] _there_ _when_ i'm taking _the line_ [up] 
B|44| g: [yeah] _below [and_ then] _like_ into [the rift valley] 
A|45| f: _okay right_ 
B|46| g: [and] [right] [through] 
A|47| f: i'll [have] [to] i'll i'll [have] [to] kind [of] change [it] _slightly_ _'cause_ _i've_ taken [it] _on the_ wrong _side of_ _this_ cactus [thing] [i] think i'll [just] [do] [a slight] detour [right _and] just_ _take it_ _straight through_ [towards _the] [top_ of the page] 
B|48| g: [straight through] [yeah] 
A|49| f: alright _there_ we [go] 
B|50| g: [and] _you want_ _to go_ [to the] sort [of] midpoint [of [the] rift valley] _you want_ [to] intersect _in the_ midpoint [of [the] rift valley] [going] [down] _the _way_ do _you_ _know_ what _i_ mean_ 
A|51| f: _not_ _quite_ 
B|52| g: [right] [you've got] [in] you're _above [the_ rift valley] _first_ [of] _all_ [right] 
A|53| f: was [i] 
B|54| g: [yeah] _above [the_ rift valley] [you] _go _above_ [the_ rift valley] [and then] [you] [start] coming [down] _as_ [in] into [the rift valley] [and] [you] intersect _like_ [the line] [of [the] rift valley] _in the_ midpoint 
A|55| f: [right] mm _that's_ _not_ _where_ [i] am [now] [right] _so_ _where_ hang _on_ [right] _so_ 
B|56| g: "your [rift valley] _is_ ""u""-shaped yeah" 
A|57| f: [yeah] [in] [a] [like] [as] _the two_ ends _are_ pointing [up towards] [top of the page] 
B|58| g: [yeah] 
A|59| f: [right and] [i] was supposed [to] [start] _above it_ _there_ [and] _come down_ [through] [it] 
B|60| g: yes 
A|61| f: _well i've_ done [it] [back] [to] front [but] never mind [right] eh _so_ [i] [should] [now] [be] [below it] 
B|62| g: [yeah] [through the] midpoint [below] _your_ [rift valley] _about_ four _inches_ [down] _do you_ [have] _rocks_ 
A|63| f: [yeah] 
B|64| g: [and] _do you_ [have] [a] _stone creek_ 
A|65| f: erm _no i've got_ _the rocks_ _i've got_ [like] _two rocks_ 
B|66| g: uh-huh 
A|67| f: [and] [again] [a] couple [of] _inches _below_ that_ _i've got_ _outlaws' hideout_ 
B|68| g: [yeah] _i've got that_ 
A|69| f: [but] [i] haven't [got] _anything else_ _round_ [about] [that] area 
B|70| g: [you've _got] nothing_ [to] [like] _the left of_ [it] 
A|71| f: er [right] over [i've got] _rapids_ [about] three [inches] across _from _the_ rocks_ 
B|72| g: _well [i've got_ a] _stone creek_ [there] _see_ _in between_ _you want_ _to _go_ [from_ [the] rift valley _right] down_ _in between [the_ rocks] 
A|73| f: [through the] centre _of the two rocks_ 
B|74| g: [no] [no] [not] sorry [i] [i] [i] _don't_ _mean_ [through [the] two rocks] _i mean_ [like] _to the left [of the_ two rocks] [about] [an inch] 
A|75| f: _right okay so_ [is] [it] [well] [okay] alright [i] think [i've got] _this_ [the] [first] part [of] _this_ [is] [a] total state 
B|76| g: _do you_ [have] white water 
A|77| f: er [well] _that'll be_ _the rapids_ 
B|78| g: [yeah] [that's] true [and] [you] _don't_ [have] [a] _stone creek_ [above] _your_ white water 
A|79| f: _no i've got_ 
B|80| g: _or_ [a] _swamp_ [to] _its_ _left_ 
A|81| f: [i've got] [the] [swamp] [and] [like] _directly_ [above _the] rapids_ [i've got [a] diamond mine] 
B|82| g: [to] _its_ _left_ [well] _that's a_ [a] _stone_ ss 
A|83| f: [but] [you know] [right] [right] [back] [at the] [start] 
B|84| g: [oh] [no] _aye_ [yeah] [you] _don't_ [have] [like] [above the] [the rapids] [to] _its_ _slightly to_ _its_ [right] [you] _don't_ [have] [a] _stone creek_ 
A|85| f: nope 
B|86| g: [no] [well] [take] _your_ [line] _right [down_ to] _your_ [rapids] _which_ [is] _my_ white water [and just] [like] 
A|87| f: am [i] [going] [above] [or] [below] _here_ [at the] moment i'm [at] [at the] moment i'm [just] [slightly [to] the left of [the] rocks] 
B|88| g: [above] 
A|89| f: _so_ where's _where_ [do] [i] [go from] [there] 
B|90| g: _right okay right_ _round the_ white water [or] [right] _round [the_ rapids] 
A|91| f: taking [it] [round] _from the top_ [or] 
B|92| g: [from the top] [but] stay [quite] close ['cause] [you] _don't_ otherwise you're _going to be_ [in that] _stone creek_ 
A|93| f: [right okay right] _so_ i'm [now] [at [the] top] _left-hand_ [corner of [the] rapids] 
B|94| g: [right okay] [come down] [come] [straight down _to] [below_ that] [like] [a] [straight] [line] [down] [but] [take it] [to] [at] least _two [inches_ below] _your_ [outlaws' hideout] [not] [like] _you mean_ [like] [straight down] [but] [like] 
A|95| f: [oh] [i] [see] [what] [you _mean] yeah_ 
B|96| g: [in] [like] length further _down from_ [that] [on [the] page] 
A|97| f: [have] _you got a_ _manned fort_ [below [the] rapids] 
B|98| g: [no] 
A|99| f: ['cause] [i've got that] interrupting er [like] [almost] _directly below it_ [slightly [to] the left] [i've got a] _manned fort_ 
B|100| g: [you got] another _stone creek_ 
A|101| f: eh [oh] [right] 
B|102| g: [and] _stone slabs_ 
A|103| f: [yeah] [it's] [right] [the way] [down] [below _the] manned fort_ [have] [you] [not] [got] _anything_ [in between [the] rapids] [and] [the] [stone creek] [down] [at the] bottom 
B|104| g: [no] [well] [yeah] [slightly to] _its_ [right] there's some _stone slabs_ 
A|105| f: [yeah] [no] [in] [right] [in between [the] two] [of] those [i've got a] _manned fort_ 
B|106| g: [no] how far down's [the manned fort] 
A|107| f: er _about two inches_ maybe [two] [and] [a half] 
B|108| g: [take it] further [down] [go] [right] under [the manned] [go] under _your_ [manned fort] [and] [between] _your [stone_ creek] 
A|109| f: [the] [stone creek] [and] [the] [stone slabs] 
B|110| g: [no] [go] _go down_ under _your_ [manned fort] [and then] 
A|111| f: [which] [way do [you] want] _me_ [to _go] round [the_ left] [or] [the] _right-hand _side_ of_ [that] 
B|112| g: [go round _the] left-hand side_ 
A|113| f: [right okay] 
B|114| g: [and then] [when] [you] get [to the] [when] [you] get [below it] [go] [up towards] _your_ [outlaws' hideout] [and] sort [of] [take] [the line] sloping [up] _so it's_ [like] [going] [straight] [up [towards] _the] outlaws' hideout_ [or] [it's] [going] close [to _the] hideout_ [it's] [like] you're [so] you're [going [to] _the] other side [of_ the page] 
A|115| f: [right] [so it's] [a] diagonal across [the page] [towards] [that] 
B|116| g: [yeah] 
A|117| f: [that] sounds [a] _bit_ drastic [right] 
B|118| g: [right] [below] _your_ [outlaws' hideout] [a] good [bit] [below] [do you] [have] [a] _noose_ 
A|119| f: [yeah] [have] _you got a gold mine_ [there] [as well] [just] 
B|120| g: [no] 
A|121| f: [just [to] [below] and] [to the right of [the] outlaws' hideout] [i've _got a] gold mine_ 
B|122| g: [no _i've got] nothing_ 
A|123| f: i'm [going to be] [quite] wealthy [i've got] [all] [the] mines 
B|124| g: [do you] [have] [a] swan pond 
A|125| f: erm [no] 
B|126| g: [no] [do you] [have] _a saloon bar_ 
A|127| f: er [i've got [a] saloon bar] [right down] [on [the] left-hand side] 
B|128| g: head for [that] [and] we'll [be] [okay] [no] [ehm] [see] [the outlaws' hideout] 
A|129| f: short cut [yeah] 
B|130| g: you're [right up] beside [that] 
A|131| f: _mmhmm_ i'm [well i've got] [it] [at the] moment i'm [slightly] [below it] [but] 
B|132| g: [you've [got] a gold mine] [a gold mine] [you got a gold mine] [below that] 
A|133| f: [yeah] 
B|134| g: far [below it] [directly below it] 
A|135| f: "not [directly below it] [just] [just [below] [the] ""u""] [if you] [take it] [down [from] [the] hideout] er [that] [that's] [just] [that's] [just] [at [the] left-hand] side" 
B|136| g: _aye_ [that'll be] [where] _my_ [that'll be] [where] _my stone_ labs [that'll be] [where] _my stone slabs are_ 
A|137| f: [but] [are] [your [stone] slabs] [not] kind [of] [at [the] other side of] [that] 
B|138| g: [i] would imagine 
A|139| f: ['cause] [my stone slabs are] [like] maybe [what] [two] [and] [a half] [inches [below] and] [to the left] 
B|140| g: _aye_ [right okay so] you're saying they're [it's] [to the right] [then] [this] [thing] 
A|141| f: [the] [gold mine] [is] 
B|142| g: [right] _above the noose_ 
A|143| f: mm [aye] [directly] [above the noose] [that's a] better description 
B|144| g: [okay] [from] [where] [that] [line] [is] [that] [you've] drawn [go] [straight _down] 'til_ [you] pass [the noose] [and] you're passing [the noose] [like] _on its right-hand side_ by [a] wee [bit] 
A|145| f: [on its right-hand side] 
B|146| g: [if [you] _know] what _i_ [mean_ yeah] 
A|147| f: [so] [that's] [like] [towards the] edge [of the] paper _here_ 
B|148| g: [mmhmm] 
A|149| f: [right] [there] we [go] [i've] [come [right] down] [below that] 
B|150| g: [yeah] [then] [you] _don't_ [have] [anything else] [down] [like] 
A|151| f: [i've got] _the saloon bar_ [and] [i've got] [the] [stone creek] [directly] across [to the left of [the] noose] er [but] [i've got nothing] [else] [in that] area [at] [all] 
B|152| g: uh-huh [right] 
A|153| f: [you know] [like] [below that] [i] [should] say [i mean] [in the] [in the] middle [and] [to] [above] them [and] [the] [stone slabs] 
B|154| g: [okay right] [you know] how [the] [like] [on] [line] with [the saloon bar] 
A|155| f: [mmhmm] 
B|156| g: [about two inches] along [i've got a] swans pond 
A|157| f: [right] [so] [i've] _to avoid that_ 
B|158| g: [you want] [to avoid [that] so] 
A|159| f: [so] [go _above] it_ 
B|160| g: need [to go] [go] [up] [above it] [and then] [down] [and] under [the saloon bar] [to the] finish 
A|161| f: phoar 
B|162| g: [is] [that] [you] 
A|163| f: [that's] [it] [yeah] 
B|164| g: yee-ha [okay] 
A|165| f: [what] [the] [first] [bit] [of] [that] was [a] total disaster 
B|166| g: he'll probably kill [me] [here] 
A|167| f: ['cause] [i] came [through the rift valley] [the] wrong [way] [i] was supposed [to come] [from the top] [and] [go [down] 'til] [like] [down] [through] [it] 
B|168| g: [yeah] 
A|169| f: ['cause] [i] [well] [i] came [from] [underneath] [don't] [know what i] was doing [down] [there]
