B|0| g: we're starting down _at_ _the_ bottom right-hand corner nearly 
A|1| f: _right_ 
B|2| g: _have_ you got crest falls 
A|3| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|4| g: _well_ _directly_ above them maybe about three quarters _of_ an inch above _there_ is _the_ start point 
A|5| f: _yeah_ 
B|6| g: _go_ along _to the_ _the left_ 
A|7| f: my [left] or [the] paper's [left] _towards_ [the] _banana tree_ 
B|8| g: there's _no_ [banana tree] _in_ this one 
A|9| f: [well] my [left] _yeah_ _paper_ [left] _uh-huh_ _right_ 
B|10| g: [uh-huh] [well] say [the] top's _north_ _and_ 
A|11| f: _right_ 
B|12| g: _go_ west 
A|13| f: okey-dokey 
B|14| g: _until_ you've _just_ got _past the_ edge _of the_ crest falls 
A|15| f: _right_ 
B|16| g: "and then come down _until_ you reach _a_ an angle maybe _just_ _past_ south [towards] west slightly _past_ _until_ you reach [the] bottom _of_ crest falls _and_ _a_ level with [the] ""c"" _and_ maybe about an inch _to_ west _of the_ ""c""" 
A|17| f: _mm_ okey-dokey 
B|18| g: [right] _and_ then _go_ due west _until_ about two centimetres from [the] edge _of the_ [paper] 
A|19| f: [right] 
B|20| g: now do you _have_ _a_ footbridge 
A|21| f: [just] [north] [of the] [banana tree] _yeah_ 
B|22| g: [right] _go_ _up_ [north] now _until_ you're [just] due [north] _until_ you're [just] _below_ [the] [the] level [of the] footbridge

A|25| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|26| g: [right] _and_ then [the] path [the] path starts again _at_ [the] other side [of the] footbridge now do you _have_ _a poisoned stream_ _there_ 
A|27| f: [no] not [at] _all_ 
B|28| g: [well] [just] [at] [the] [the] footbridge next _to_ when you come off there's _a poisoned stream_ _so_ when you come off [the] footbridge you _have_ _to_ _go_ due south maybe about an inch _and_ _a_ half 
A|29| f: [right] 
B|30| g: [uh-huh] _and_ then och take _a_ wee bit more _to_ _be_ safe [just] _a_ wee touch more 
A|31| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|32| g: _and_ then do you _have_ an old temple 
A|33| f: yes 
B|34| g: [right] _go_ along eastward for about two inches 
A|35| f: _mmhmm_ 
B|36| g: _and_ then curve _up until_ you're [at] [the] bottom [of the] old temple 
A|37| f: rightee-ho 
B|38| g: [mmhmm] now _go_ _up_ about two _and_ _a_ half inches do you _have_ _anything_ above [the] old temple _in_ that area _up_ _there_ 
A|39| f: nothing [up until] [a poisoned stream] 
B|40| g: [right] _what_ about do you _have_ an abandoned _truck_ 
A|41| f: [what] _way_ [to [the] left] _of it_ 
B|42| g: [uh-huh] 
A|43| f: _yeah_ 
B|44| g: is _there_ _anything_ between [the] old temple _and _the_ truck_ 
A|45| f: eh slate _mountain_ 
B|46| g: [right] _i_ don't _have_ that 
A|47| f: [mmhmm] 
B|48| g: _go_ two _and_ [a] half inches [up] over [the] temple [the] [up] [the] side [of it] 
A|49| f: [right] 
B|50| g: _and_ then _and_ then say an angle [of] northwest forty-five degrees 
A|51| f: [mmhmm] 
B|52| g: _go_ [up] for about two inches that would probably take you _past _the_ top [of_ the] 
A|53| f: [up] [past [the] truck] [and _the] mountain_ 
B|54| g: something [uh-huh] 
A|55| f: [right] 
B|56| g: [and] then back down [at] [the] same angle [to] [well] [the] opposite angle anyway [to] get you down [to] your abandoned [truck] [just] _below it_ 
A|57| f: [right] 
B|58| g: [and] then _go_ straight across [the] bottom [of the] abandoned [truck] 
A|59| f: [mmhmm] 
B|60| g: "until you're [just] _below_ [the] ""a""" 
A|61| f: [right] 
B|62| g: now _have_ you got baboons 
A|63| f: [no] 
B|64| g: [right] now come due south 
A|65| f: _yeah_ 
B|66| g: about an inch [and] [a] half [to] an inch [and] three quarters 
A|67| f: [mmhmm] 
B|68| g: [and] then due west for about two inches uh then 
A|69| f: [right] 
B|70| g: do you _have_ [a] white [mountain] further [up] 
A|71| f: yes [uh-huh] 
B|72| g: "right now [well] [the] best thing [to] do first [of] [all] would _be_ come back [up] [to] where you were [at] [the] ""a"" [and the] come [up] [to] make that [a] ""u"" shape" 
A|73| f: [mmhmm] 
B|74| g: [and] then draw [a] line straight between this point [and] maybe about half [a] centimetre [to the] west [of the] bottom [of the] white [mountain] 
A|75| f: [right] 
B|76| g: [right] now [mm] _go_ [up] [the] side [of [the] mountain] [until] you're maybe follow [the] side for [up until] about half an inch _below_ [the] summit 
A|77| f: [mmhmm] 
B|78| g: [and] then change [to] going due [north] for about three inches 
A|79| f: [up] [past the] _lemon grove_ 
B|80| g: ah there's [no] [lemon grove] _in_ this one 
A|81| f: [right] 
B|82| g: [right] is _there_ [a] pyramid 
A|83| f: [mmhmm] 
B|84| g: [yeah] now this'll _be_ you [just] about [a] third [of the] [way] [up] [the] pyramid 
A|85| f: [mmhmm] 
B|86| g: [and] then straight across [until] about [a] centimetre [to the] west [of the] pyramid 
A|87| f: will we walk [to [the] top [of] it] 
B|88| g: [no] straight across [until] 
A|89| f: [right] 
B|90| g: on [the] same level 
A|91| f: okey-dokey 
B|92| g: [and] then [mm] _go_ [up] over [the top [of] the] pyramid [and] _in_ [a] [a] cone sort [of] [a] [a] triangle shape [and] down [the] other side [until] you're [at] [the] base [of the] pyramid 
A|93| f: [yeah] 
B|94| g: [right] do you _have_ [a] cobbled street 
A|95| f: [no] 
B|96| g: [right] _below_ [the] pyramid there's [a] cobbled street [and] 
A|97| f: [directly] [below it] 
B|98| g: ehm it's [below] [the] western side [of the] pyramid 
A|99| f: [right] [so] it'll [be] [mmhmm] 
B|100| g: "now from where you are [just] now draw [a] curved line 'til you're [below] [the] ""d"" [of] pyramid" 
A|101| f: [right]

A|103| f: [right] 
B|104| g: [right] _go_ [at] an angle slightly more slightly [to the] west [of] south 
A|105| f: [right] 
B|106| g: [to] avoid [the] cobbled street _there_ [and] do you _have_ [a] remote _village_ 
A|107| f: [mmhmm] 
B|108| g: [and] [just] [to] where [the] [the] thick lines [at] [the] remote _village_ drawing are 
A|109| f: [yeah] 
B|110| g: [just] about [a] centimetre [to the] west [of the] thick line [and] stop _there_ 
A|111| f: [right] 
B|112| g: "now curve round draw [a] curve [until] you're [below] [the] ""r"" [of] _remote"_ 
A|113| f: [mmhmm]

B|116| g: ["the ""e"" _in] village_ sorry" 
A|117| f: """e"" [in village] right" 
B|118| g: [and] then _go_ straight across another inch [and] that's [the] finish
