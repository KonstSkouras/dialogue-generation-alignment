B|0| g: _okay ehm_ _have_ you _got_ _a_ starting point above _the missionary camp_ 
A|1| f: _uh-huh_ _i_ [have] _yeah_ 
B|2| g: _and_ [have] you _got_ _gorillas_ 
A|3| f: _no_ 
B|4| g: well they're in _the_ _bottom_ _left-hand_ corner 
A|5| f: [bottom] 
B|6| g: roughly _up_ _a bit_ huh 
A|7| f: _of the_ [camp] _or_ _of the map_ 
B|8| g: [of the map] 
A|9| f: [of the map] _now_ _i_ _have a_ banana tree instead 
B|10| g: _right_ _okay so_ if you _just_ _go_ _left_ from _the missionary camp_ _a bit_ _and_ then _down_ 
A|11| f: [left] [and] [down] 
B|12| g: [yeah] _to_ _about_ [a] couple [of] _centimetres_ above _the top of the_ [bottom] _of the page_ 
A|13| f: [yeah] 
B|14| g: [and] then _continue_ _straight_ [left] _along_ _until_ _about four centimetres_ from [the] _end_ [and] then _go_ _straight up_ again 
A|15| f: _so that_ i'm _on_ _the left_ [of] _what i_ [have] as [a] banana tree 
B|16| g: sorry 
A|17| f: _so that_ _i_ [end] [up] _on_ _the left_ [of] _what_ is [the] banana tree _on_ this [map] _or_ maybe [the] [gorillas] _on_ yours 
B|18| g: [yeah] probably [yeah] 
A|19| f: [okay] 
B|20| g: _uh_ _do_ you [have a] _rope bridge_ 
A|21| f: _i_ [do] [ehm] [do] _i_ _avoid_ [the missionary camp] _where_ i'm moving 
B|22| g: [yeah] 
A|23| f: [so] _i_ move [along] _so that_ i'm _to the left_ [of [the] missionary camp] _when_ _i_ _go down_ 
B|24| g: _uh-huh yeah_ 
A|25| f: _okay now_ i'm _at _the_ left-hand side of the_ banana tree [about] 
B|26| g: _right_ 
A|27| f: almost [the] extreme [left] [of _the page] and_ [about four centimetres] [up] 
B|28| g: _mmhmm_ 
A|29| f: [about] quarter [of the] way [up] 
B|30| g: _okay that's fine_ [now] _you've_ _got_ _the rope bridge_ 
A|31| f: [uh-huh] 
B|32| g: [so that] you want [to] come _up [the page_ and] then _just_ [when] you're [about] in line _with _the_ rope_ _rope bridge_ _just_ turn _right so_ you're across it 
A|33| f: [okay so] i'm _going_ [straight up] [and] _actually_ cross _over [the_ rope bridge] 
B|34| g: [yeah] 
A|35| f: [so] _i_ move [up] [and] cross _over [the_ rope bridge] [right so] i'm [now] standing _at the_ other _side of [the_ rope bridge] 
B|36| g: [okay] if you [now] come [down] [a] couple [of] [centimetres] 
A|37| f: [uh-huh yeah] 
B|38| g: [and] [do] you [have a] _waterfall_ 
A|39| f: [yeah] _it's_ _right of_ _where_ _i_ am _at the moment_ 
B|40| g: [yeah] if you _just_ _mm_ [do] you [have a] sort [of the] water coming [down] 
A|41| f: [uh-huh] 
B|42| g: if you sort [of] head [along] 
A|43| f: [mmhmm] 
B|44| g: [so that] you're [about] in line _with the_ [bottom] [of the] water 
A|45| f: [uh-huh] 
B|46| g: if you know [what i] mean 
A|47| f: [yeah] 
B|48| g: [and] then [have] you _got lost steps_ 
A|49| f: _no no_ [steps] 
B|50| g: [okay] if you _just_ get [to _the] waterfall_ first [and] then you want [to] [go] [straight up] [to] [where] these _lost steps_ _are_ 
A|51| f: oh [yeah] which [are] [where] 
B|52| g: well [have] you _got_ _fallen pillars_ 
A|53| f: [mm] [yeah] [i] [do] [yeah] 
B|54| g: [it's] [it's] in [the] finishing point 
A|55| f: _no_ 
B|56| g: [no] [ehm] [it's] [about] in line _with _the_ fallen pillars_ 
A|57| f: [uh-huh] 
B|58| g: _to the right of_ them 
A|59| f: [yeah] 
B|60| g: in between _the rope bridge and the waterfall_ 
A|61| f: all [right so] [you've] [the rope bridge and the waterfall] [and [the] fallen pillars] [so] _at the moment_ i'm _at [the_ waterfall] 
B|62| g: [uh-huh] well you want [to] [go] [straight up] 
A|63| f: [straight up] 
B|64| g: [and] [you've] _got_ [the] _lost steps_ 
A|65| f: [yeah] [so] i'm [straight up] i'm [now] _at [the top_ of [the] waterfall] [ehm] not _quite_ _halfway_ [up the page] 
B|66| g: if you [go] [straight up] from [the waterfall] you keep [going] [up] _until_ you're in line _with [the_ fallen pillars] 
A|67| f: [okay] 
B|68| g: but don't [actually] [go] near them 
A|69| f: _yeah [okay_ that's fine] 
B|70| g: [and] [that's] you if you sort [of] curve off [to the left] 
A|71| f: [uh-huh] 
B|72| g: you'll miss [the] _lost steps_ 
A|73| f: [okay] [and] how far [along] [do] [i] move 
B|74| g: _um_ [to] [about] _just_ before [the] middle [of the page] 
A|75| f: [fine] 
B|76| g: [and] then you want [to] come [down] in [a] diagonal [so that] [you've] missed [the fallen pillars] [and] [go] _underneath_ them 
A|77| f: [uh-huh] [okay that's fine] i'm [now] _halfway_ [along] _underneath [the_ fallen pillars] 
B|78| g: [right] _just_ keep [going] 'til [the] [end] 
A|79| f: [okay] 
B|80| g: [of [the] fallen pillars] [yeah] _um_ [now] [go down] two [or] _three_ [centimetres] 
A|81| f: [yeah] 
B|82| g: [do] you [have] an obstacle there 
A|83| f: [i] [do] flamingoes 
B|84| g: well _uh_ [i] think you're probably trying [to] [avoid] [that] [so] if you [go down] _um_ [and] then [left] in [a] sort [of] curve 
A|85| f: [uh-huh yeah] 
B|86| g: [and] [up] again [and] you're pretty near [the] edge [of the page] 
A|87| f: [yeah] 
B|88| g: then [do] you [have] ancient ruins 
A|89| f: [um] ruined city is _about three_ quarters [up] _on_ [the page and] [just] slightly [to the right of] [where] [i] am _at the moment_ 
B|90| g: [yeah okay] [just] like _a bit_ [up] from [the fallen pillars] _and [to the_ left] 
A|91| f: [yeah] [yeah] [uh-huh] 
B|92| g: well you want [to] sort [of] come towards [the] ancient ruins _a bit_ 
A|93| f: [yeah] 
B|94| g: without [actually] coming into contact _with_ them 
A|95| f: [yeah [okay] so] i'm i'm moving [right] basically 
B|96| g: [a] [straight] line 
A|97| f: [right] _now do_ [i] move [up] [so that] i'm _level_ [with the] ruined city 
B|98| g: [yeah] 
A|99| f: [uh] [um] [okay] [right] [now] i'm i'm _on_ _the left-hand side of the_ ruined city [and] _about three_ quarters [of the] way [up the page] 
B|100| g: [yeah] [now do] you [have] stones in [the top] [left] 
A|101| f: _eh_ [no] [i] [have a] rock fall which is _about halfway_ [along] [the page and] _about three_ quarters [of the] way [up] 
B|102| g: [no no] [it's] [okay now] if you [just] [uh] [at the top] there's some stones [and] [that's] [about four centimetres] from [the top] 
A|103| f: [uh-huh] [okay so] [just] [continue] [to] move [straight up] 
B|104| g: [yeah] 
A|105| f: [until] almost [at the top] 
B|106| g: [to] [about four centimetres] 
A|107| f: [fine] 
B|108| g: [and] then you want [to] [go] sharp [right] 
A|109| f: [mm] 
B|110| g: [to] [about halfway] across [the page] 
A|111| f: [okay] 
B|112| g: [now do] you [have a] white _mountain_ 
A|113| f: [uh-huh] 
B|114| g: you want [to] [just] _go over [the_ top of] [that] [and] round 
A|115| f: [so] [go over _the] mountain_ 
B|116| g: [mmhmm] 
A|117| f: [okay ehm] i'm [at] _about three_ quarters [of the] way [along] [and] [at] almost [at [the top] [of the] page] 
B|118| g: [yeah okay] [um] [do] you [have a] soft furnishings store 
A|119| f: [no] i've [got lost steps] [actually] 
B|120| g: [eh] [right] [um] you're [quite] close [to [the] mountain] [at the moment] [on] its _right-hand side_ 
A|121| f: [yeah] [yeah] 
B|122| g: well if you under directly [underneath [the] mountain] [about three] [centimetres] [down] there's [a] soft furnishings store 
A|123| f: [yeah] 
B|124| g: [so] you want [to] come [down] from [the _mountain] and_ turn sharp [left] 
A|125| f: [mountain and] move [yeah] 
B|126| g: [so that] you're sort [of] in line [with [the] left-hand side of [the] mountain] 
A|127| f: [okay] 
B|128| g: then you come _straight down and_ [right] 
A|129| f: [and] [straight down and] 
B|130| g: [do] you [have] _gazelles_ 
A|131| f: [yeah] 
B|132| g: [underneath] them 
A|133| f: [so] [do] [i] move [to [the] left-hand] [or] _the right-hand side of the_ [gazelles] 
B|134| g: [the right-hand side] 
A|135| f: [fine] 
B|136| g: [to] [about] [the right-hand side of [the] mountain] [level] if you know [what i] mean 
A|137| f: oh [i] see [right] [that's] [a bit] further [along] [fine] 
B|138| g: [okay that's] it 
A|139| f: [so] i've stopped [so] [ehm] [i] am [three] quarters [of the] way [along] slightly more than [halfway] [up] [and [to the] right [of] the] [gazelles] 
B|140| g: [yeah] 
A|141| f: [yeah] 
B|142| g: [that's] [right] 
A|143| f: [fine] [okay]
