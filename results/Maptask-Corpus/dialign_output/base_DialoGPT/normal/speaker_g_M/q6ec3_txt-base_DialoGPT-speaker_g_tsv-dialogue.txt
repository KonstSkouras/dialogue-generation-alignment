A|0| M: _i_ dont _get_ _it_ 
B|1| g: roughly _up_ _a bit_ huh 
A|2| M: i'm guessing they're all around _the_ corner _from_ me 
B|3| g: _of the map_ 
A|4| M: Of [the] _camp_ 
B|5| g: _right_ _okay_ _so_ _if you_ _just_ _go_ _left_ _from the_ missionary [camp] _a bit_ _and then_ _down_ 
A|6| M: I'm not sure how _to_ _get_ _it_ , _but_ _it's_ _on_ [the map] . 
B|7| g: _yeah_ [to] _about_ _a_ couple _of_ centimetres above _the top_ _of _the_ bottom of the_ page 
A|8| M: _i_ _don't_ _get_ _it_ 
B|9| g: _and then_ continue _straight_ _left_ along until _about_ four centimetres _from the_ _end_ _and then_ _go_ _straight up_ _again_ 
A|10| M: _i mean_ i'm _going_ [to] try _it_ [right] _now_ 
B|11| g: sorry 
A|12| M: _i_ _don't_ see _what_ [you] _mean_ 
B|13| g: _yeah_ probably _yeah_ 
A|14| M: yes , _but_ [if] _you're_ _on_ _the right_ , _you'll_ [end] [up] [right] _on_ [the] far [left] 
B|15| g: uh _do you_ _have _a_ rope_ _bridge_ 
A|16| M: ok _i_ [have] [the] redwood tree _and the_ red wood [bridge] 
B|17| g: _yeah_ 
A|18| M: ok , [do _you] know_ how [to] build [a rope] ? 
B|19| g: uh-huh _yeah_ 
A|20| M: uhh _where_ [do _you] go_ ? 
B|21| g: [right] 
A|22| M: [right] _side of_ course 
B|23| g: mmhmm 
A|24| M: _i_ see 
B|25| g: _okay_ that's fine [now] you've got _the rope_ [bridge] 
A|26| M: I'm not _going_ [to] say anything 
B|27| g: _so_ _that_ _you _want_ to_ _come_ _up the_ page _and then_ _just_ when [you're] _about_ _in_ line _with_ _the rope_ [rope] [bridge] _just_ _turn right_ _so_ [you're] across [it] 
A|28| M: i'll [do] _that [and_ then] i'll _get_ back [to] [you] 
B|29| g: _yeah_ 
A|30| M: ok , how _about [the_ rope] ? 
B|31| g: _okay_ _if you_ [now] _come_ _down_ [a] couple [of] centimetres 
A|32| M: ok i'll try [to] be _there_ 
B|33| g: [and] [do you] _have a_ _waterfall_ 
A|34| M: I [have a] fire 
B|35| g: _yeah_ _if you_ _just_ mm [do you] [have a] sort _of _the_ _water_ coming_ _down_ 
A|36| M: [okay] im _at the_ plaza 
B|37| g: _if you_ sort [of] head along 
A|38| M: [okay] i'm heading _there_ [now] 
B|39| g: _so_ [that] [you're] [about] _in_ line _with_ _the bottom of _the_ water_ 
A|40| M: _i_ [have a] little [bit] [of] [water coming] [up the] _side of the_ lake . 
B|41| g: _if [you_ know] [what] [i mean] 
A|42| M: ohh ... _well_ ... 
B|43| g: [and then] _have you_ got _lost steps_ 
A|44| M: [and] THEN [have you] been [lost] _in [the_ water] ? 
B|45| g: [okay] _if you_ _just_ _get to _the_ waterfall_ first [and then] _you _want_ _to_ go_ _straight _up_ to_ [where] these _lost steps_ _are_ 
A|46| M: I am _in [the_ waterfall] [and] [i] am _going_ [straight up] 
B|47| g: [well] [have you] got _fallen pillars_ 
A|48| M: I [have] [fallen pillars] , which [are] [lost steps] ? 
B|49| g: [it's] [it's] [in the] finishing _point_ 
A|50| M: [i] dont [know] how [to] [do] this 
B|51| g: _no_ ehm [it's] [about] [in] line _with_ _the [fallen_ pillars] 
A|52| M: _i think_ [it's] _on_ [the] final [point] 
B|53| g: _to _the_ right _of_ them_ 
A|54| M: _there_ is [no] [end] 
B|55| g: [in] between [the rope] [bridge] [and [the] waterfall] 
A|56| M: [where] exactly ? 
B|57| g: uh-huh [well] _you _want_ _to_ go_ [straight up] 
A|58| M: I _don't_ [want to] be stuck _in a_ cliff 
B|59| g: [and] you've got [the] [lost steps] 
A|60| M: [and [the] fallen] [steps] 
B|61| g: _if [you_ go] [straight _up] _from_ [the_ waterfall] [you] keep _going up_ until [you're] [in] line _with_ [the [fallen] pillars] 
A|62| M: theres [a] little [waterfall] [going [up] from] [a bit] [of [the] top] [right] corner 
B|63| g: [but] [don't] actually [go] near _them_ 
A|64| M: [but] [you] can [go] [up [to] [the] fallen] pillar 
B|65| g: [and] that's [you] _if you_ sort [of] curve off [to the] [left] 
A|66| M: i'm [in [the] waterfall] 
B|67| g: [you'll] miss [the] [lost steps] 
A|68| M: [i] [have a] feeling [you're] [going] [to] [have a] hard time finding [a] parking spot 
B|69| g: um [to] [about] _just_ before _the middle_ [of the] page 
A|70| M: [where] is [the] little blue circle _at [the_ bottom] [right] ? 
B|71| g: [and then] _you [want_ to] _come_ _down_ [in a] diagonal _so_ [that] you've missed [the [fallen] pillars] _and go_ underneath _them_ 
A|72| M: [the] one [in [the] middle] is [the] last step 
B|73| g: [right] _just_ keep [going] 'til [the] [end] 
A|74| M: _i think_ [i] [just] [have] [to] [do] [the] same thing 
B|75| g: [of [the] [fallen] pillars] _yeah_ um [now] [go] _down_ two or three centimetres 
A|76| M: ok i'll try [that] 
B|77| g: [do you] [have] an obstacle [there] 
A|78| M: not anymore 
B|79| g: [well] uh _i think you're_ probably _trying to_ avoid [that] _so_ _if [you_ go] _down_ um [and then] [left] [in a] sort [of] curve 
A|80| M: [i] [have] [it] [but] [i] dont [know] how [to] [get] [it] 
B|81| g: [and] [up] _again_ [and] [you're] pretty near [the] edge [of the] page 
A|82| M: try clicking _on_ [the bottom [of the] map] 
B|83| g: [then] [do you] [have] _ancient_ ruins 
A|84| M: [i] [have a] lot [of them] 
B|85| g: _yeah_ [okay] _just like_ [a bit] [up _from] [the_ [fallen] pillars] _and [to_ the] [left] 
A|86| M: [up] [and to] [left] 
B|87| g: [well] _you [want_ to] sort [of] _come_ towards _the ancient_ ruins [a bit] 
A|88| M: [you're] not helping me [with] this . 
B|89| g: without actually [coming] into contact [with] [them] 
A|90| M: [you] could [just] use [a] portal [to [the] ancient] ruin 
B|91| g: [a] [straight] line 
A|92| M: i'm [just] gonna say [that] this is [a] nice thing [to] [do] 
B|93| g: _yeah_ 
A|94| M: _so you_ wanna help me out ? 
B|95| g: _yeah_ _now do you_ [have] stones [in [the] top] [left] 
A|96| M: [i] can't [get] [them] [to] work 
B|97| g: [no] [no] [it's] [okay] [now] _if you_ [just] uh [at [the] top] there's some stones [and] that's [about] four centimetres _from [the_ top] 
A|98| M: [okay] [then] , I'll try [to] find [it] 
B|99| g: _yeah_ 
A|100| M: [yeah] , [just like] [that] 
B|101| g: [to] [about] four centimetres 
A|102| M: he's not moving [at] all 
B|103| g: [and then] _you [want_ _to] go_ sharp [right] 
A|104| M: I'm [trying to] [get to the] [point] [where] I [want to] hit [a] guy [right] [in the] face 
B|105| g: [to] [about] halfway across [the] page 
A|106| M: [and] [you want] me [to go] fast 
B|107| g: _now do you_ [have a] white _mountain_ 
A|108| M: ok [now do [you] want] me [to] teach [you] how [to] ride [a] [mountain] 
B|109| g: [you [want] to] [just] _go over_ [the top] [of] [that and] round 
A|110| M: I'm sure [it's] not , [but] I'm sure [you] could tell [from the] way [it's] shaped . 
B|111| g: mmhmm 
A|112| M: So [go over] [that [and] [go] over] [it] [again] 
B|113| g: [yeah] [okay] um [do you] [have a] soft furnishings store 
A|114| M: ok umm [i think] [i] [have] [to go] buy [a] new one 
B|115| g: eh [right] um [you're] quite close [to _the] mountain_ [at the] moment [on] its right-hand [side] 
A|116| M: i'll be [there] [in a] minute 
B|117| g: [well] _if you_ _under_ directly underneath _the mountain_ [about] three centimetres _down_ there's [a] soft furnishings store 
A|118| M: [i] live [on] [the mountain] 
B|119| g: [so [you] [want] to] _come_ _down_ [from [the] mountain] [and] _turn_ sharp [left] 
A|120| M: yes [i] am 
B|121| g: [so] [that] [you're] sort [of] [in] line [with] [the] left-hand [side of [the] mountain] 
A|122| M: I'm [a] little confused . 
B|123| g: [then] _you come straight_ _down_ [and] [right] 
A|124| M: [but] [what] [if you] [turn right] ? 
B|125| g: [do you] [have] gazelles 
A|126| M: [you come [straight] up] [and] [down] 
B|127| g: underneath [them] 
A|128| M: [so] [what] [you're] saying is [that] [the] ones [that] [go] [under] [the top] [are] [the] best ? 
B|129| g: [the] right-hand [side] 
A|130| M: how [do you] [get] gazelle ? 
B|131| g: [to] [about the] right-hand [side of [the] mountain] level [if [you] know] [what] [i mean] 
A|132| M: To [the right [of] [the] top] gazelle 
B|133| g: [okay] that's [it] 
A|134| M: [the mountain] 
B|135| g: [yeah] 
A|136| M: [i think you're] [going] too far 
B|137| g: that's [right] 
A|138| M: [i] [have a] new weapon
