A|0| M: sarah _and_ dan 
B|1| g: _right_ 
A|2| M: left _is_ _a_ hole _in_ _the_ ground 
B|3| g: okay _i_ want _you_ _go_ _down_ _about_ three inches 
A|4| M: I'm _so_ sorry . 
B|5| g: yeah 
A|6| M: [you] _got_ _it_ 
B|7| g: _just_ _down_ at [the] _side_ _just_ straight _down_ 
A|8| M: how far ? 
B|9| g: [and] then _go round_ _in _a_ curve_ underneath _the diamond_ mine 
A|10| M: [i] can _do that_ , i'll _be_ _on_ [in _a] bit_ 
B|11| g: then [you] want _to_ start _like_ carry [on] [that] _curve_ _for_ _about_ four _or_ five inches _just_ gradually heading _up_ _the way_ _right_ 
A|12| M: _no_ , i'm [just] _going_ _to be_ [in] [the way] 
B|13| g: [no] [no] [no] [no] 
A|14| M: [no] , it's [the diamond] 
B|15| g: past [the diamond] mine _not_ [that] _not_ [that] _steep_ _a curve_ _like_ [just] 
A|16| M: _you're going_ [to] make [a curve] _that's_ [not] [steep] 
B|17| g: [just] _like_ [just] more [a] wee [bit] more than [a] straight line along past [the diamond] mine 
A|18| M: [the] [curve] _is_ [a] little [steep] [for] me 
B|19| g: [i] _i don't_ suppose you've [got] _a graveyard_ _have_ [you] 
A|20| M: [i don't] think _so_ 
B|21| g: [no] _right_ 
A|22| M: [no] , [i] [have] [a graveyard] 
B|23| g: yeah okay _what_ [you] want _to do_ [is] [is] [you] want [to be] sort _of_ _like_ [going] _up_ [and] then curving _right_ _round_ [the] fast flowing _creek_ 
A|24| M: [i] dont know how _to go_ [about] _it_ 
B|25| g: yeah _over _the_ top_ 
A|26| M: [you] wanna [go round] [up] 
B|27| g: [and] _down_ [the] right-hand _side_ 
A|28| M: [and] [over the] left [side] 
B|29| g: _right_ 
A|30| M: Left [side] 
B|31| g: _see_ your apache camp 
A|32| M: we'll [see] 
B|33| g: _right_ head _down_ towards [that] [and] then [just] [curve] _down_ [the] left-hand [side] [that] 
A|34| M: [right] ? i'm [not] sure [what] [to do] 
B|35| g: _canoes_ 
A|36| M: canoe [or] [canoes] ? 
B|37| g: [no] i've [no] [got] _any_ [canoes] 
A|38| M: _no you_ [have] [canoes] . 
B|39| g: _do you_ [see] [the] carved wooden pole 
A|40| M: [i] [have] [the] [canoes] [and] [canoes] , [i] can't get [the] canoe , _but_ [i] can get [the] canoe [and] canoe 
B|41| g: [no you] [see] [the] walled city 
A|42| M: [no] , I [don't] 
B|43| g: [right] _well_ _when you_ _when_ [you're] _coming down_ [the] left-hand _of_ [the] apache camp [just] keep heading along [and] [go] [over _the] top of_ [the] walled city 
A|44| M: [when you] _are_ [coming down] 
B|45| g: okay [and] then [just] _like_ [a] nice big [curve] heading [down] [about] six inches 
A|46| M: ok i'll [see] [what] [i] can [do] 
B|47| g: [you] [see] [the] carved wooden pole at [the] bottom 
A|48| M: yea sure 
B|49| g: _well_ [you] [you] _need [to_ be] [about] two inch [you] [you] _need to_ end [up] [about] two inches from _the top_ there 
A|50| M: [what] [do you] mean ? 
B|51| g: two inches above [it] 
A|52| M: You [don't] [need _to] go_ [any] _further_ 
B|53| g: yeah 
A|54| M: _so_ ... how far ? 
B|55| g: sort _of_ curving [round] now [see] _stone creek_ 
A|56| M: [right] , 
B|57| g: [right] [you're] [just] heading along past [that] [you] [see] [the] _flat_ rocks 
A|58| M: it's [not] [a] [flat] rock , it's [a] [flat] lake 
B|59| g: [no] 
A|60| M: [i] think it's [the top of] _stone creek _and_ [the_ top] [right] [of] stonecreek 
B|61| g: great ehm okay head [up] ehm past [stone creek] [you] [need [to] be] [going] at [about] [up] curving [up] _to _the_ right_ at [about] [a] forty-five degree angle 
A|62| M: I'm [not] sure [what] [you're] trying [to] say 
B|63| g: aye 
A|64| M: [you're] [not] [in a] cave 
B|65| g: [right] [you] _well right_ [you're going] past [you're going] [up] [over] [stone creek and] your line's [just] [about] touching _where_ [flat] rocks [is] written 
A|66| M: [right] me [well right] me [well] [what] [is] [flat] rock ? 
B|67| g: [so] [that's] _where_ [you] want [to] end [up] 
A|68| M: i'm [not] even sure 
B|69| g: now keep heading _to _the_ right_ [a bit] 
A|70| M: I'm [on] [the right] . 
B|71| g: [further] until [you're] [about] an inch _away_ from [the] edge [of] [the] paper 
A|72| M: far [away] 
B|73| g: [right] [see] [the] _buffalo_ 
A|74| M: left [right] 
B|75| g: ah [right] [right] head [down] [the right] sand _hand side_ [of] [the] paper [and] [curve] underneath [the] _buffalo_ 
A|76| M: [right] [hand side] [down] 
B|77| g: [do you] _see a_ cattle _ranch_ [no] 
A|78| M: [i] [see a] horse [ranch] 
B|79| g: [right] ehm [you] [see] [that] _fort_ 
A|80| M: [i] [see a] [buffalo] 
B|81| g: [away] at [the] other [side] [right] [you're] heading [to go] under [that] [but] _like_ [on] your [way] [about] halfway between [the] [buffalo] [and _the] fort_ there's [a] wee blip [in] your line 
A|82| M: [i] cant [see] [it] , im [on] [the right] [side] 
B|83| g: _like_ [you're going] [over [the] top] something [and] then [coming] _back_ [down] [and] [going] under _the fort_ 
A|84| M: [like] _where are you_ [going] ? 
B|85| g: [so] [just] [do that] 
A|86| M: [the] one [in] [the] [back] 
B|87| g: [right] [where are you] now then 
A|88| M: [right] [over [the] fort] ? 
B|89| g: [right] [you] [just] want [to] [curve] [up] [the] left-hand [side] [of] [the fort] [just] [curve] [a] nice big [curve] [round] [it] 
A|90| M: how [do] [i] get [to [the] fort] ? 
B|91| g: [and] [that's] [it] [you're] finished
