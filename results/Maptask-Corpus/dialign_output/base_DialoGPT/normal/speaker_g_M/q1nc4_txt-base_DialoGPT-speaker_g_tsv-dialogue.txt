A|0| M: _yeah_ i'm pretty sure _i_ _have a_ few _of_ those _in_ my inventory 
B|1| g: _you_ _don't_ [have a] _forge_ well _the forge is_ eh below _the_ _the_ cliffs say _about_ _two_ inches _down_ _okay_ _so_ _you_ _go_ _from _the_ start_ slightly _to_ your _right_ _down the_ _way_ _right_ [a] curve 
A|2| M: turn around 
B|3| g: _to _the bottom_ of the_ cliffs 
A|4| M: _where_ _is it_ ? 
B|5| g: _and_ _then_ _you_ _start_ _to_ _go_ _left_ _go_ _about_ half _an_ inch out _to the_ _left_ _and_ _and_ _down_ _about_ _you know_ _two_ _and a_ half inches three inches 
A|6| M: _i don't_ [know] _how_ [to] _get [to the_ bottom] 
B|7| g: _an_ inch _and a_ half _if_ _you_ _draw_ _that_ _line_ _down_ you'll be _on the_ left-hand _side_ _of _the_ forge_ _you_ [don't] [have a] _forge_ _but_ _there_ [is] _one_ _there_ 
A|8| M: _what_ [if] _you're_ [on _the] right_ hand [side] ? 
B|9| g: _so_ _now_ [you're] _about_ 
A|10| M: _it's_ _not_ _really_ [a] problem [if] [you're] [a] [right] handed man 
B|11| g: _you_ should [really] end _up_ _about_ four inches _down_ _from the_ _the cross_ er _you know_ _in the_ same _line_ like _just_ beneath [it] [in] fact four inches _down_ _okay_ 
A|12| M: i'm _not_ sure _how_ [you] can _tell_ [the] length [of] [a] [cross] 
B|13| g: _no_ _no_ 
A|14| M: [you know] 
B|15| g: _no_ [the] initial _line _from_ _the_ cross_ 
A|16| M: [no] _it's_ [a] _long_ [way] _to the right_ 
B|17| g: goes [right] _but_ [it] doesn't _go_ as _far_ [right] as [the] cliffs 
A|18| M: i'm confused 
B|19| g: [it] goes _down_ [to] [where] [it] says cliffs _okay_ 
A|20| M: i'm confused [the] first [line from] [a] [cross] [the] second [line from] [an] enemy 
B|21| g: _about_ [a] centimetre [from] [where] [it] says cliffs [to the] left-hand [side] [of] [it] _okay_ _then_ [you] _go_ back _left_ slightly until [you're] beneath [the] _the start_ _and_ _down_ [you know] _two_ _or_ three inches until [you're] 
A|22| M: _i don't_ _get_ [it] 
B|23| g: [yeah] 
A|24| M: [right] [right] straight [down [the] start] [then] [you're] [in [the] bottom of [the] start] ? 
B|25| g: until [you're] _about_ [you know] four inches _or_ four _and a_ half inches _or_ _so_ [down] _from [the_ start] 
A|26| M: [left] straight [up] ? 
B|27| g: _do _you_ have_ [an] _old pine_ 
A|28| M: yes [but] _i_ can't use my _old pine _or_ a_ new [pine] 
B|29| g: [yeah] [a] single [old pine] 
A|30| M: _i don't_ [know] _how_ you'd _get_ [that] [from the] picture . 
B|31| g: _and_ [down] [down] as _far_ as [that] _okay_ 
A|32| M: u dogetipbot 50 doge verify 
B|33| g: [but] [you know] beneath [the start] 
A|34| M: there's [a] [way] 
B|35| g: _so_ [then] [you] _go right_ _which_ would be _under the forge_ _and_ [you] _go up_ over [the] [old pine] _okay_ 
A|36| M: _i_ [go up] [to [the] forge] 
B|37| g: over [the] [pine] 
A|38| M: [under the forge] 
B|39| g: [yeah] more [or] less 
A|40| M: _i_ [go right] [up] 
B|41| g: as as [long] as [you] avoid [the forge] _and_ [the] [pine] [you] [you] [don't] [have] [to] 
A|42| M: [so] ... _how far_ can _i_ [go] ? 
B|43| g: worry too much _about the_ exact 
A|44| M: _not_ [really] 
B|45| g: route [but] eh 
A|46| M: _i_ [have a] torch [and a] torch . 
B|47| g: [right] [so] once [you're] at [the] top [of the] [pine] [if] [you] [go] _about_ _two_ [and a] half inches three inches [to the right] [have] [you] got _a pine_ forest 
A|48| M: _i don't_ [know] _how_ [to] [do] [that] . 
B|49| g: _you have_ well _just go_ [down the] left-hand [side] [of the] [pine] forest 
A|50| M: huh ? _how_ [do] _i_ [do] [that] ? 
B|51| g: you've got [a] _bay_ _there_ 
A|52| M: [and [a] pine] tree 
B|53| g: [i don't] [have a] _bay_ _there_ it'll be at [the] top 
A|54| M: [i] dont [have a] tree [there] 
B|55| g: [have] [you] got [a] _bay_ at [the bottom] 
A|56| M: uhhhhhhhhhhh 
B|57| g: _crane bay_ 
A|58| M: [which] [one] _is it_ ? 
B|59| g: where's _the one_ at [the] top 
A|60| M: _what_ [about [the] one] _above_ [it] ? 
B|61| g: _how far down_ 
A|62| M: theres [a] [way] [to] _get_ [the] screenshot [up] 
B|63| g: [yeah] well [don't] [go] much [you know] [don't] [go] any higher than than [the] [the] height [of the] [old pine or] [or] [the] forest [that] must be [where] _the bay_ [is] [i don't] [have a] _bay_ [there] [but] [the] route [you know] must miss _the bay_ er [so] [you know] _just go_ along 'til [you] [get to the] [pine] forest more [or] less [and] [then] [go] [go] [down] [on the] left-hand [side] [of the] [pine] forest 
A|64| M: goin for [the bay] 
B|65| g: _okay_ once [you're] at [the bottom of the] [pine] forest _just_ [where] [it] says [pine] 
A|66| M: _that's_ [the bay] . 
B|67| g: _okay_ [if] [you] [if] [you] _just_ kind [of] _draw_ [a] _draw_ [an] arc er [to the right] _just_ more [or] less [the] same direction as you've been _going_ until [have] [you] got _wheatfields_ 
A|68| M: h 
B|69| g: [on] your _map_ [no] well [the] 
A|70| M: _what_ [if] [i] [just go] [to the bottom] [right] ? 
B|71| g: _you have_ [right] 
A|72| M: [no] _it's_ [a] [map] 
B|73| g: well [just] _draw_ [the] arc [and] _stop_ [the] arc [you know] [in] [line] with [the] _wheatfields_ [but] beneath [the] [pine] forest _okay_ 
A|74| M: [i] dont [know] [i] didnt [draw] [it] . 
B|75| g: _oh_ _two_ [or] three inches [down] [from the] [pine] forest _okay_ [you know] [it] doesn't [have] [to] be [an] arc as [long] as [you] avoid all [the] obstacles _i think_ eh [if] [you] [you know] [if] [you] finish [up] eh [in] [line] with [the] _wheatfields_ _okay_ [but] beneath [the] [pine] forest [you] [if] [you] _stop_ drawing your [line] [there] [above] _the bakery_ [in] _other_ words [above] [the] eh 
A|76| M: _it's_ [a] joke 
B|77| g: well er [you know] imagine [where] [the forge] would be [on] your [map] [or] [it's] [it's] [on] mine [but] imagine [where] [it] would be 
A|78| M: im [in [the] forge] 
B|79| g: [about] _two_ inches [down] [from] [that] [in] [in] between [the] [the forge] [and] [the] [old pine] 
A|80| M: [how far down] 
B|81| g: [on the] left-hand [side] _okay_ [so] _where are you_ _now_ 
A|82| M: [the forge _is] right_ [there] 
B|83| g: mmhmm [no] [no] [no] 
A|84| M: [up] [to [the] forge] [where] [you] meet [the] new guys [then] we'll [get to _the] other side_ 
B|85| g: [no] [don't] worry [about the] _wheatfields_ [it's] [just] [to] [tell] [you] [where] [to] _stop_ _the line_ 
A|86| M: can [i] [stop] ? 
B|87| g: never mind [about] [it] being [an] arc [or a] curve [or] anything 
A|88| M: [no] [i] mean [the line] _not the_ wheat field 
B|89| g: [just] [just go] [down the] left-hand [side] [of the] [pine] forest 
A|90| M: [i] am [just] wondering [how] [you] did [it] 
B|91| g: _okay_ [and] once [you] [get to the] [where] [it] says [pine] [draw] [a] [line from] [there] [to] eh [above] _the bakery_ [but] [not the] chimney [a] bit [to the] [left] [of] [that] [in] fact [the] left-hand [side] [it] must be [a] wee shed [or] whatever [it] [is] 
A|92| M: [i] am 
B|93| g: [you] _see what_ [i] 
A|94| M: ohh [i] [see] 
B|95| g: [yeah] [but] [stop] _when you_ [get] [just] [to] [above] _the bakery_ 
A|96| M: [you] can [see what] im [going] [to] [do] [right] [now] 
B|97| g: [then] [just go] round _the bakery_ [on the] right-hand [side] [just] [draw] [a] [an] oval shape round [the] right-hand [side] [of _the] bakery_ 
A|98| M: i'm [not] sure [what] [you] mean . [i] can't [draw] circles [on the] ground . 
B|99| g: [yeah] [right] round [it] uh-huh 
A|100| M: [what] [is] [the] best [way] [to] [do] [that] ? 
B|101| g: underneath _the bakery_ 
A|102| M: [in the] corner 
B|103| g: [have] [you] got [a] _canal_ 
A|104| M: [under [the] bakery] . 
B|105| g: [no] well _the canal_ [is] [about] _two_ inches [to the] left-hand [side] [of [the] bakery] [but] [it's] [in] [line] with [it] [so] once [you] [get] [an] inch [or] [and a] half [or] [so] past [the bakery] 
A|106| M: [i think] [you] mean [the canal] 
B|107| g: eh take your [line] [down] [to] _crane bay_ _oh_ i've got _two_ _wheatfields_ [that's] [not] important [is it] [right] anyway [so] [you] [get to [the] canal] [right] [you] [don't] [have] [one] [but] [just go] [down] [about] _two_ inches until [you] [get to] _crane bay_ [and] follow follow [the] curve _okay_ [of] _crane bay_ 
A|108| M: [the] [two] little [wheatfields] 
B|109| g: [but] [not] [don't] [go] [down] [just go] along [don't] [go] [don't] [go] [down] [where] [it] [it] [really] curves away [there] [don't] [don't] follow [that] 
A|110| M: [yeah] ... 
B|111| g: [so] [you're] at [the] top left-hand [side] [of] _crane bay_ [right] [just] northwest [of] [where] [it] says _crane_ 
A|112| M: i'm [on [the] right] 
B|113| g: "or [the] [where] [the] ""c"" is" 
A|114| M: [what] [about the] [crane bay] ? 
B|115| g: i've got [wheatfields] [in] [line] with [where] [it] says [bay] _okay_ [about] [an] inch [or] [so] [to the] [left] [of] [crane bay] itself [just] [in] [line] [in] fact beneath [where] [the other] [wheatfields] were [that] [i] [that] [i] was telling [you] [about] 
A|116| M: [what] [are you] talking [about] ? 
B|117| g: _okay_ [so] [you] [go] round [the] round [that] curve [and] _you have_ [to] [go] [down] [and] [about] [an] inch [and a] half _okay_ [to] [to] avoid [the] [wheatfields] [which] [are] [just] [to the] [left] [of] [crane bay] [so] [you] [go] [down] [there] [right] 
A|118| M: [so] i'm [not] wrong ? 
B|119| g: [go] beneath [the] [wheatfields] [in] [other] words [draw] [a] [line] [you know] [two] inches [or] [so] [to the] [left] [have] [you] got _a rocket_ warehouse 
A|120| M:  
B|121| g: well [just] [draw] [a] [line] between well [above] [the] _rocket_ warehouse [in] fact _okay_ 
A|122| M: [how] [do [you] know] [when [you] [have] [a] rocket] farm ? 
B|123| g: [an] [an] inch [or] [so] [above] [the] [rocket] warehouse [but] [to the] [left] [of] [it] [go] round [it] [the] same [way] as [you] went round [the] igloo [but] [on [the] other side] _okay_ [just] follow [it] round 
A|124| M: [i don't] [get] [it] 
B|125| g: [go] [down the] left-hand [side] [of the] page once you've done [that] 
A|126| M: [i] [know] [right] ? [how] [do you] [do] [that] ? 
B|127| g: [have] [you] got [a] lighthouse 
A|128| M: [the] building [in the] background 
B|129| g: [the] [rocket] warehouse 
A|130| M: [where are you] standing ? 
B|131| g: _the cross [is_ right] next [to the] lighthouse [and] [just] take your [line] [to] [there] [and] [that's] [it] finished 
A|132| M: [i] can help u [in] [a] sec 
B|133| g: [on the] left-hand [side] [of] [it] 
A|134| M: [where] [is] [the cross] ? 
B|135| g: well [yeah] [that] would be _okay_ 
A|136| M: [right] [i] [just] wanna [know] [how far] [the cross is] 
B|137| g: uh-huh [and] [just] [the cross [is] right] [you know] [the] left-hand [side] [of the] lighthouse [just] next [to] [it]
