A|0| M: _it's just a_ little _curve_ 
B|1| g: uh-huh [just] [just] below _the burnt_ forest without _touching_ _the burnt_ forest 
A|2| M: _how_ _do _you_ get to [the_ burnt] tree ? 
B|3| g: _right_ _you're_ _what_ _you're_ _going to do_ _is_ _you're_ _going to_ [curve] [to _the] _right_ _and_ then_ _back_ _left_ okay _so_ _that_ _when you_ come _you're_ _going to_ _be_ about three [to] four inches below directly below start 
A|4| M: [right] _i_ _can_ _see_ _it_ 
B|5| g: _understand what_ [i] _mean_ _so_ _it's not_ _going to_ [it's] _it's not_ _going to_ _be_ [a] _straight_ _line_ [it's] _going to_ _be_ [a] [curve] 
A|6| M: understood , [what] _is it_ [going to] ? 
B|7| g: _no_ 
A|8| M: _have_ they gone [to _the] wrong_ end ? 
B|9| g: _no_ _you just_ [see] [how] 
A|10| M: [is] _this_ [a] joke 
B|11| g: uh-huh _you just_ 
A|12| M: [i] think [you just] _got the_ joke 
B|13| g: uh-huh [it's just a] slight [curve] 
A|14| M: huh u [just] 
B|15| g: uh-huh _and then_ _back_ [to _the] left_ 
A|16| M: um , [and then] [the right] 
B|17| g: okay _so_ _you're_ about eh three [to] four inches below start [then] directly underneath 
A|18| M: yeah [i] think [so] 
B|19| g: [right] okay [so] _you're_ [going to] _in a_ _straight_ _line_ _go _go_ to [the_ right] _have you_ [got the] _ravine_ 
A|20| M: [no] its [just a] regular [ravine] [that] [i] built 
B|21| g: [right] [going _to] _go_ straight_ along _ehm_ _say_ about along [to [the] right] leaving about an inch about an inch from [the] [ravine] 
A|22| M: [right] , _that's the_ way _it_ [is] 
B|23| g: uh-huh [then] _you're_ [going to] eh slope _up_ [to [the] right] eh _oh_ uh-huh [to _the] left_ _of the_ [ravine] _you're_ [going to] slope _up_ _go_ above [the] _top_ _of the_ [ravine] 
A|24| M: [right] [go go] 
B|25| g: mmhmm 
A|26| M: [right] [go] ahead 
B|27| g: uh-huh uh-huh 
A|28| M: uhuh uh uh 
B|29| g: uh-huh [right] [do _you] have_ [the] remote village 
A|30| M: uhh [what] ? 
B|31| g: [right] _well_ [it] doesn't doesn't matter 
A|32| M: [right] [i] _don't_ care 
B|33| g: uh-huh _you can go_ about [a] centimetre above [the] [the] [ravine] okay [and then] 
A|34| M: [i] [have] [to go] _now_ , _but_ i'll [be] [back] later 
B|35| g: uh-huh uh-huh 
A|36| M: umm [how] _are you now_ ? 
B|37| g: [and then] _you're_ [going [to] _go] straight_ along [to [the] right] _in a_ _straight_ _line_ 
A|38| M: uhhuh _but_ _then [you_ have] _to go in a_ circle 
B|39| g: uh-huh okay [so] [don't] [go] as _far_ as [the] pine grove 
A|40| M: huhuh uh 
B|41| g: _right _so_ you_ should [be] about _ehm_ level _with_ [the] _top_ _of the_ pine grove [that] [that] _far_ _up_ 
A|42| M: [and then] _i'm_ [going [to] _the] bottom_ [of the] tree 
B|43| g: [but] _you're_ about _you know_ _you're_ _not_ [in] _near the_ _you're_ _not_ _at_ [the] pine grove yet 
A|44| M: _yes_ [and] _i'm not_ [near the] pinegrove 
B|45| g: [so] _you're_ about an inch [and] [a] half from [the] pine grove _you're_ [going to] _your_ _line is_ [going to] slope _down_ [to [the] right] [but] _you're_ [going to] keep [to the] left-hand _side [of_ the] pine grove [i'm not] making [this] very easy _am i_ [right] 
A|46| M: I'm [not] sure . 
B|47| g: [see] [what] [i] _mean_ 
A|48| M: I [don't] think [you know] [what] [a] [line is] 
B|49| g: _so _you_ _go_ down_ until _you're_ _ehm_ 'til _you're_ _at_ [the bottom] left-hand _corner_ [of the] pine grove 
A|50| M: I [don't] [understand _what] you_ [mean] 
B|51| g: mmhmm 
A|52| M: I'm guessing _you are_ _in [the_ bottom] [right] [corner] ? 
B|53| g: [no] _not touching_ 
A|54| M: _yes_ [touching] 
B|55| g: okay 
A|56| M: [not touching] [it] 
B|57| g: [right] [right] _have you_ [got _the] concealed_ _hideout_ 
A|58| M: open [and] shut case 
B|59| g: _oh right_ okay _ehm_ directly above _the concealed_ _hideout_ 
A|60| M: [you] [mean] [the] _one_ _on [the_ bottom] [right] ? 
B|61| g: okay _well_ [i] haven't [got] [that] _but [what_ you] [what] _you're_ _going to do_ [is] _you're_ [going to] [right] you've [got] we've [got] another [curve] [on the] [line] [so] [this] [is] probably why _you're_ _curving_ [to] avoid [that] avalanche _so _you_ curve_ first [of] all [to [the] right] 
A|62| M: yeah [i] [have] [that] , I've [got the] [hideout] [on [the] bottom] [left] . 
B|63| g: okay _moving_ _down_ all [the] time 
A|64| M: [well] _i've_ been doing [it] _for_ [a] while [and] [i'm] still [curving] [it] 
B|65| g: _you're_ [just] _you're_ [just] _you're_ [going] _down_ [but] also [to [the] right] _you're_ _you're_ 
A|66| M: what's [going to] happen ? 
B|67| g: uh-huh 
A|68| M: [it's] [a] secret 
B|69| g: _right _what_ happens_ [is] _you go_ _you curve_ [to [the] _right] [and_ then] [back] into _the left_ [and [then] _you] curve_ [to [the] right] again along [the] _top_ [of] [this] _concealed_ [hideout] 
A|70| M: I [know] [what happens] , [but [what] happens] [when [you] [go] straight] [to the] middle [of the] cover ? 
B|71| g: [no] 
A|72| M: [do [you] [go] to [the] bottom] ? 
B|73| g: [no] 
A|74| M: Do [you curve] ? 
B|75| g: [no] _you're_ [going] _you're_ [going [to] [go] to [the] right] [of _the] concealed_ [hideout] _you're_ [going [to] go] along [the] _top_ [to [the] right] 
A|76| M: [so] [i'm] [going [to] _the] wrong_ [hideout] [right] ? 
B|77| g: mmhmm 
A|78| M: [no] its [not] 
B|79| g: 'til you've sort [of] curved [to [the] right] [then] [to _the] left_ [and then] [back] _out_ [to [the] right] again 
A|80| M: What _are you_ doing ? 
B|81| g: uh-huh 
A|82| M: huh ? 
B|83| g: [right] okay _ehm_ _right so_ _you're_ where [are you now] [then] 
A|84| M: [i] [am] [not] 
B|85| g: okay _right ehm_ _have you_ [got _the] boat house_ 
A|86| M: _yes_ [i] [have] 
B|87| g: _right what_ _you're_ _going to do_ [is] _you're_ [going to] [curve] round _the concealed_ [hideout] [going] round [the right] [of] [it] [and then] [straight] along until [you get to _the] boat house_ [the bottom] left-hand [corner] [of _the] boat house_ 
A|88| M: [right ehm] [how] [do you] [do] [that] ? 
B|89| g: [no] [bottom] right-hand [corner] [of _the] boat house_ 
A|90| M: [bottom] [left] 
B|91| g: [right] okay [right] _have you_ [got the] _crane bay_ 
A|92| M: I'm _in [the_ boat] [with] [you] . 
B|93| g: [right] _you're_ [going [to] [go] straight] _down_ eh [straight] _down_ [to the] _crane bay_ 
A|94| M: [right] [i'm] [going to do] [it] 
B|95| g: uh-huh 
A|96| M: u [have] [a] [boat] 
B|97| g: _oh_ [is it] 
A|98| M: [the boat house] . 
B|99| g: _oh_ you've [got] [a] different [boat house] [i've] [got] two [boat] houses 
A|100| M: uhhhmmm ... hmmm ... 
B|101| g: uh-huh [so] we've made [a] mistake [you] 
A|102| M: u [got] 2 btw 
B|103| g: [right] okay [you] [see] my [boat house] [is] [to _the] left_ [of _the] concealed_ [hideout] 
A|104| M: its [just a] [hideout] , [so [you] can] hide _in the_ water [and] [not] risk drowning 
B|105| g: [right] okay _sorry_ [that's [the] wrong] [one] [you] [don't] wanna [go] anywhere [near] [that] [one] [right] 
A|106| M: [the] [one] [on [the] right] [is] [the] [one] [on] [top] 
B|107| g: uh-huh [just] [just] scrub [that] _bit out_ [then] [and] [go] [back] _up_ [to _the] concealed_ [hideout] 
A|108| M: [you] can't change [the] _map_ ... 
B|109| g: _right so_ [so] we'll _say_ we're _at_ [the bottom] right-hand [corner] [of _the] concealed_ [hideout] 
A|110| M: yup [and then] u 
B|111| g: mmhmm 
A|112| M: [bottom] [left] 
B|113| g: [right] okay 
A|114| M: I [have] [no] idea 
B|115| g: [right] _you're_ [going [to] go in a] [straight] [line] along _the left_ [of the] _page_ okay 
A|116| M: mmmhmmm ... 
B|117| g: [to] [to _the] left_ [of the] _page_ [not] [not] [right] along [i] [mean] [it] [in a] [i] [mean] [in a] [left] direction 
A|118| M: [oh right] 
B|119| g: mmhmm under [that] uh-huh 
A|120| M: Under [the concealed] hiding [hideout] ? 
B|121| g: [right] [don't] [go] [right] [right] _you can go_ _a bit_ further about another inch 
A|122| M: [right what] [am i] looking [at] 
B|123| g: okay [now] [right] look _down_ [to the] _crane bay_ [right] 
A|124| M: [i'm] [just [a] bit] _more_ _right now_ 
B|125| g: [ehm] [straight] _down_ from [that] _have you_ [got] an actual wee _bay_ _there_ _like_ curves 
A|126| M: [there] [is] [a] [crane bay] ? 
B|127| g: from where [you are] [at] [the] moment 
A|128| M: [straight] [up] ? 
B|129| g: _right so_ we'll [go straight] _down_ [then] [straight] _down_ [and] [don't] _hit the_ [bay] [but] [but] _follow_ [that] [curve] [in the] [bay] [so] _you're_ [going [to] [go] straight] _down_ south 
A|130| M: [that's] [how] [you get] stuck [on [the] bottom] [of the] lake 
B|131| g: okay 
A|132| M: [you can [go] straight] [up] , you'll [hit the] sea 
B|133| g: _have you_ done [that] [then] 
A|134| M: [go straight] [up] [then] [go down] 
B|135| g: [right] 
A|136| M: [how] [do you] [say] [that] ? 
B|137| g: [right] _have you_ [got the] coconut palm 
A|138| M: _yes_ sir 
B|139| g: _hmm_ _have you_ [got the] pebbled shore 
A|140| M: _yes_ [i] [do] 
B|141| g: which [is] where [is it] [on] _your_ [map] 
A|142| M: [oh] [no] 
B|143| g: [oh] you've [got] another [boat house] 
A|144| M: I [have] [a] [boat house] . 
B|145| g: uh-huh [but] [right] [have] [oh] god [right] where [are you now] again 
A|146| M: [oh] yeah , [i] did _that right_

B|149| g: mmhmm 
A|150| M: _yes_ _yes_ 
B|151| g: [right] 
A|152| M: I think [you] [mean] [the] c 
B|153| g: [right] [that's] perfect _right so_ _you're_ [going to] come [down] [and] _follow_ [that] wee [curve] 
A|154| M: [oh] [i'm] [sorry] [i'm not] _good_ [at] [that] , i'll [just] take [it] 
B|155| g: [right] 
A|156| M: [right so] youre _going to follow the_ [curve] 
B|157| g: [to _the] left_ 
A|158| M: [of the] stick 
B|159| g: [straight] [down] [and then] [left] 
A|160| M: [up] [and then] [down] 
B|161| g: "okay [so] _you're_ _you're_ sort [of] [on] [on the] [corner] [on the] [bit] [that] juts _out_ [now] above [the] ""c"" [of] crane" 
A|162| M: I [don't] [know] , I [don't] [have] any idea . 
B|163| g: [is] [that right] 
A|164| M: u [are] [a] little slow 
B|165| g: [right now] [right what] _you're_ [going to do] [now] [is] _moving_ [down] all [the] time [but] _you're_ _you're_ [not] [going to follow the] coastline as much _you're_ [going to] slightly move away from [it] 
A|166| M: [right] ... [you're] [right] 
B|167| g: okay eh [but] [going] [down] [at] [the] same time [so] [down] about an inch [and] [a] half 
A|168| M: [hmm] ... ok ... 
B|169| g: uh-huh 
A|170| M: [how] [far] [do [you] go] ? 
B|171| g: [ehm] uh-huh [yes] [more] or less [but] [don't] [go] as [far] as [that] 
A|172| M: So , [it's] [a] river ? 
B|173| g: okay 'cause [you're] [going [to] go] [you're] about an [a] centimetre above [the] pebbled shore [and] [you're] [going [to] go] along [the] [top] [of the] pebbled shore 
A|174| M: yeah [but what] if I'm [in a] [boat] 
B|175| g: _moving_ eh [left] 
A|176| M: hmhmhmhmm yeah 
B|177| g: okay [then] [so] [you're] about [so] once [right] where [are you now] 
A|178| M: I'm [a] little [out] [of the] way 
B|179| g: [right] okay move [you're] [going to] move [to _the] left_ [but] _moving_ [down] [at] [the] same time 
A|180| M: ok im [moving] [now] 
B|181| g: okay until [you] [for] about two or three inches until [you're] about [a] centimetre from [the] left-hand _side [of_ the] _page_ 
A|182| M: I'm [not] really sure [what] I'm doing . 
B|183| g: [no] 
A|184| M: [have you] washed _stones_ ? 
B|185| g: where [are] _your_ uh-huh [you] should [be] about [a] couple [of] inches below [it] [but] [not] directly under [it] 
A|186| M: [how] [do you] [do] [that] ? 
B|187| g: uh-huh 
A|188| M: _where's_ [the] blue [line] ? 
B|189| g: [a] [good] [bit] [to _the] left_ [of] [it] 
A|190| M: ohh yeah 
B|191| g: uh-huh 
A|192| M: Uhh , [on [the] right] [side of] [that] [page] 
B|193| g: okay [where's] _your_ [stones] 
A|194| M: ok , [where's] [the left] [side of] [your] [page] ? 
B|195| g: [right] okay [well] [you're] [going to] [curve] round them [right] [have you] [got the] flagship 
A|196| M: [oh] , yeah [that's] [what] I meant 
B|197| g: [and] [the] [bit] [and] [the] _bit of_ land [that] juts [out] [well] [and] [the] [bit] [that's] 
A|198| M: [yes] , [i] [know] 
B|199| g: uh-huh uh-huh 
A|200| M: uhuhuh uhuh 
B|201| g: [right so] [what] [you're] [going to] [is] [curve] round [your] [stones] [there] [and] [your] [the] finish [is] [just] [ehm] about [a] centimetre from [that] black [line] [that's] marking [the] [crane bay] [just] directly _across_ from [the] ship 
A|202| M: [it's] [a [bit] of] [a] circle , [so] [it] looks [like] [the] [one] [you're] trying [to] [get] [across] [is] [a [bit] out] [of the] way . 
B|203| g: [right] 
A|204| M: [right and] [you are]
