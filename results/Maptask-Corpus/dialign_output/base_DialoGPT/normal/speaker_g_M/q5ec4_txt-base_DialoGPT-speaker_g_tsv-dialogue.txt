B|1| g: _pass them_ _on your_ _their left_ 
A|2| M: _right and_ how _do_ _you_ [pass them] ? 
B|3| g: uh-huh [right _and] then_ [have] [you] got _a_ forge underneath [the] cliffs 
A|4| M: [pass] [the] _on the_ [right and] _the bottom_ [pass] [the] [on] [their left] . 
B|5| g: oh [have] [you] got an old pine _tree_ sort _of_ _down_ diagonally [right] _from_ [the] cliffs 
A|6| M: _yeah_ _i_ _do_ 
B|7| g: [right] well sort _of_ pretend there's _a_ forge [right] below [the] cliffs [right and] instead _of_ [right] _so_ [you] _go down_ round [the bottom] _of the_ forge _so_ like _draw a_ sort _of a_ pretend semicircle 
A|8| M: _i_ can't think [of] anything 
B|9| g: well like _you know_ _a_ pretend loop 
A|10| M: _what_ _do_ [you] mean ? 
B|11| g: [right] _start_ [right] _so_ _you're_ _just_ below [the] cliffs 
A|12| M: _i_ _don't_ [know] _what_ _that_ means 
B|13| g: [right] _so_ [you] [go] _out_ _towards_ _outside _of_ the map_ 
A|14| M: i'm _in the_ mountains _so [the_ map] _is_ _in _the_ middle_ [of the] mountains 
B|15| g: [yeah] _and then_ round [the bottom] [of the] forge which isn't _there_ 
A|16| M: _it's_ _in _the_ middle_ [of the] cliff 
B|17| g: _but_ [it's] [on] [on the] same level as [the] pine _tree_ 
A|18| M: _that's_ _not_ [there] 
B|19| g: [right _and] then_ [you] [go up] [the] inside [of the] pine _tree_ 
A|20| M: [yeah] [but] _i_ can't _get_ [up] [there] because [it's] [a] firepit 
B|21| g: [right] [not] no [that] _the left_ [of the] pine _tree_ [so the] [that's] _outside _of_ the map_ 
A|22| M: [right] _the outside of_ [that] [tree] 
B|23| g: uh-huh 
A|24| M: [you know] [the] [right] [of the] pines 
B|25| g: uh-huh 
A|26| M: u want _to_ [go] [there] 
B|27| g: [yeah] 
A|28| M: uhhuh ? [the] [tree] _is_ [on your] [left] 
B|29| g: _and then_ [so] _you get_ [to the top] [of the] pine [tree] 
A|30| M: i'll _do_ _it but_ i'll [have] [to] [go] [to] work now 
B|31| g: [right _and] then go_ vertically across [to] _about_ two thirds across _the page_ 
A|32| M: [and] _what_ _are _you_ going to_ _do_ [about] _it_ ? 
B|33| g: horizontally sorry 
A|34| M: [you're] [on] [a] list now 
B|35| g: uh-huh [have] [you] got [a] pine forest [on] [right] 
A|36| M: turn _around_ 
B|37| g: well [you] _slope_ _down_ with [the] pine forest [on your] [right] 
A|38| M: _what_ _is the_ pattern [on your] feet ? 
B|39| g: aha [so] _don't go_ round [the] pine forest _just_ like [pass] _down_ by [it] 
A|40| M: nah [it's] [the] [slope] [on [the] left] 
B|41| g: "right _and then_ _just_ _where_ [the] word pine forest _is _just_ stop_ at [the] ""p""" 
A|42| M: [so] [just stop] [right] [there] 
B|43| g: [right _and] then_ sort [of] loop round [a] wee _bit more_ [don't] [don't] _draw_ [your] _line_ [in the] same angle sort [of] _make it _a_ bit_ flatter _and then_ _draw_ _another_ wee loop 
A|44| M: [right] [but] [the] point [is just] [right] . 
B|45| g: [what] 
A|46| M: _i_ can _do_ _this_ [but] _i_ can't _do_ [it] [right] now 
B|47| g: no [i] haven't got [a] stream [i] suppose [just] avoid [the] stream [but] sort [of] like as though 
A|48| M: [i] think [you] mean [a [bit] more] 
B|49| g: [you're] _drawing a_ _nose_ [right] say [this] [is _the] face_ [you're] _drawing_ _and then_ you've got [to] sort [of] [do] [a] sort [of] round [bit] _for _the_ nose_ 
A|50| M: [i] am [drawing a] [face] [i] think 
B|51| g: beneath [the] pine forest uh-huh 
A|52| M: [and] [the face] [of the] [tree] 
B|53| g: [right] [have] [you] got [a] bakery underneath [right] [a bit] lower _down_ 
A|54| M: bend [the] knee bend [the] knee 
B|55| g: [right] [so] _see_ when _the nose_ comes _out_ [it] comes _back in_ [to [the] face] 
A|56| M: [you know] [what] ? 
B|57| g: [right] [that] should _be_ [just] above [the] bakery 
A|58| M: [right] [do] [you] want me [to] _take_ _it back_ [to [the] nose] 
B|59| g: [is] [that] okay 
A|60| M: i'm good 
B|61| g: _and then go_ [and] _do another_ big [nose] round [the] bakery 
A|62| M: [then] [do another] one 
B|63| g: uh-huh _and then_ _come_ [right] _back in_ 
A|64| M: [you're] [not] gonna give me [a] good answer 
B|65| g: underneath [the] bakery [and] maybe [in] past [the] bakery [about] two centimetres [just] before [the] canal [have] [you] got [a] canal 
A|66| M: _yes_ ! [i] want [to] [see] [the] [tree] ! 
B|67| g: all [right] [right] [just] _come_ [in] two centimetres _towards [the_ middle] 
A|68| M: [yeah] [i] can [do] [that] . [do] [you] want me [to] [come] [back in] [a] couple [of] hours ? 
B|69| g: _from_ [the] bakery 
A|70| M: [where] [do] [you] want me [to] meet [you] ? 
B|71| g: "right _and then_ [are you] sort [of] above [the] ""e"" [in] _crane_ bay" 
A|72| M: [i] am [from] _crane bay_ [and] [i] am looking [for the] [right and] [the] second 
B|73| g: [right] well _go down_ _towards the_ coast 
A|74| M: [i] dont _know where_ _crane bay_ [is] 
B|75| g: [right _and] then_ follow [the] [crane bay] round [the] coast 
A|76| M: [right] [then] 
B|77| g: "to _the [to_ [the] left] [it's] _towards the_ ""c"" [of] [crane] bay" 
A|78| M: i'm pretty sure [it's] [in [the] middle] [of the map] . 
B|79| g: [right and] eh [then] [it's] sort [of] [have] [you] got wheatfields 
A|80| M: ok [then] its [towards [the] to] [right] [it's] toward [the to] [a] [a] 
B|81| g: oh [you] got _a rocket_ _warehouse_ 
A|82| M: [that's] [what] [i] meant [i] meant [the] ones [that] [are] [on [the] top] [and] they're [not] [in [the] top] [left] 
B|83| g: mm [right] okay [is] [that] sort [of] above _the lighthouse_ 
A|84| M: [i] think [you] [have] [to] [be] [in [the] lighthouse] [to] [get] [the] crates . 
B|85| g: [right] well sort [of] sticking [to the] coast [you [know] where] [the] coast goes [up] [and] _down_ vertical 
A|86| M: [i] dont _have a_ [warehouse] 
B|87| g: [right] sort [of] _don't go_ vertically _down_ [it but] _start_ sloping _down_ [towards] [around] [the top] [of _the] rocket_ [warehouse] 
A|88| M: _yes_ mister 
B|89| g: uh-huh 
A|90| M: [about] [the] mountain 
B|91| g: _and then_ [slope] [the] _line_ [right] _out [to_ the] _side [of_ _the] page_ 
A|92| M: how would [you get] [the top] [right] [side [of] a] [page] ? 
B|93| g: uh-huh 
A|94| M: [left] [out to] [page] 
B|95| g: [the outside [of] _the] page_ _and then_ eh sort [of] _draw a_ [are you] [about] [in] _line_ with _the rocket_ [bit] or [have] [you] done [that] 
A|96| M: [left] [the page] [to] [draw a] [line] 
B|97| g: no [but] like [see] [where] [your] [line] [is] at [the] [side [of] [the] page] [is] [that] at _rocket_ like [where] [the] words _rocket_ [are] written 
A|98| M: [the rocket] part ? 
B|99| g: [right] [so] _we_ [just] like [take] [the] [line] _down_ vertically _down_ [the] [side [of] [the] page] 
A|100| M: [it] [is] [a bit] hard [to] read 
B|101| g: [for] [about] two centimetres 
A|102| M: [for] [a] minute 
B|103| g: _and then_ curve [it [back] in] [towards the] old light _house_ [don't] [have a] cave 
A|104| M: _yes_ [and then] [we] _will_ [start] [to] build [a] [house] 
B|105| g: [you going to] hit [it] 
A|106| M: i'm [going to] [make it [a] rocket] 
B|107| g: okay 
A|108| M: [just] [don't go] [in] too far 
B|109| g: [yes] [yeah] oh [will] [that] put [you] [in the] sea 
A|110| M: [and then [go] down] further 
B|111| g: okay [then] 
A|112| M: i'll [make] [a] video 
B|113| g: [just stop] at [the] old [lighthouse] uh-huh 
A|114| M: [i] [don't] [know] [what] [to] [do] now
