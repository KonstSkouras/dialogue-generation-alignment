B|28| g: an inch _and a_ half _if you_ draw [that] line _down_ you'll be [on the] left-hand _side of _the_ forge_ [you] [don't have a] _forge_ [but] _there is one_ _there_ 
A|29| M: [yes] _i_ am

A|57| M: what's [that] 
B|58| g: _and then_ _back down_ at [the] same angle [to] well _the opposite_ angle anyway _to get_ [you] _down_ [to] your abandoned truck [just] _below_ [it] 
A|59| M: uhhh ... huh ...
