B|0| g: _right_ _you're_ _what_ _you're going _to_ do_ _is_ _you're going _to_ curve_ _to _the_ right_ _and then_ _back_ _left_ _okay_ _so_ _that_ when _you_ _come_ _you're going to_ _be_ _about_ three _to_ four _inches_ below directly below start 
A|1| M: [okay] _where_ _are_ [you] ? 
B|2| g: _no_ well 
A|3| M: [the] cave [is] [about] 2 blocks away 
B|4| g: yes 
A|5| M: can [you] please tell _me_ how [to curve] [the] [curve] ? 
B|6| g: _right_ 
A|7| M: _right now_ 
B|8| g: _you _have_ a_ fast flowing creek 
A|9| M: _oh_ i'm _on_ [the right] _side_ 
B|10| g: [right] _and then_ [to] your [right] again 
A|11| M: [the] only way [to do] _it_ 
B|12| g: _no_ [the] height above _them_ but _just_ below _the lake_ but above [the] antelope 
A|13| M: [then] _go_ _east_ [and] _up the_ slope 
B|14| g: past _the cottage_ 
A|15| M: _turn_ around 
B|16| g: [right] _so_ we'll [go] straight _down_ [then] straight _down_ [and] _don't_ hit [the] bay but but follow _that_ [curve] _in the_ bay _so_ _you're going _to_ go_ straight _down_ _south_ 
A|17| M: _i_ [have a] feeling [you're going to] [have a] hard time finding [a] parking spot 
B|18| g: [right] _what_ happens [is] _you go_ [you] [curve] _to [the_ right] _and then_ _back_ into [the] _left_ _and then_ [you] [curve] _to [the_ right] again along _the top of_ this concealed _hideout_ 
A|19| M: _yeah_ [back] [down] 
B|20| g: _no_ well _take_ your line [right] [down] [to] your rapids which [is] _my_ white water [and] _just_ like 
A|21| M: ok alright alright

B|32| g: [turn] [right now] [go] diagonally [down] towards [the] not [a] steep diagonal towards [the] middle 
A|33| M: i'll [be] there 
B|34| g: [you're] coming [you're] coming [back] [you're] coming [down] [the] map _so_ [you're] turning [left] _that's_ into _that's_ into [the] map 
A|35| M: _i_ dont think [so] 
B|36| g: between _the cottage_ _and the_ ravine 
A|37| M: [turn] around 
B|38| g: above

B|40| g: understand _what_ [i] mean [so] _it's_ not [going to] _it's_ _it's_ not [going to] [be] [a] straight line _it's_ [going to] [be] [a] [curve] 
A|41| M: [the] other _side_ 
B|42| g: [yeah] _that's_ true [and] _you don't_ [have a] stone creek above your white water 
A|43| M: [no] [i] dont 
B|44| g: [right] [you] uh-huh below [the] diamond mine 
A|45| M: [so] i'm [going [to] the] wrong [hideout] [right] ? 
B|46| g: [go] [right] [go] straight underneath [the] trout farm 
A|47| M: [what] ? i'm confused . 
B|48| g: um [do _you] have_ anything between this cattle stockade _and the_ bandit territory 
A|49| M: how [do you] get [to [the] top _of the] mountain_ ?

B|64| g: past [the] [the] shelter _that's_ over [the top] 
A|65| M: [now] pass [the] wall 
B|66| g: [okay] [now] should _come_ [to] [a] [do [you] [have] a] monument 
A|67| M: [yeah] [just] keep walking [north] till [you] get [south]
