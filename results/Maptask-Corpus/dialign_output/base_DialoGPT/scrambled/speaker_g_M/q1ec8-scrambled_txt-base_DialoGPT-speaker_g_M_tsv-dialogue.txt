A|1| M: _right_ _where_ _you_ _want_ _them_ 
B|2| g: _okay_ _that's_ _it_ 
A|3| M: _i_ _just_ hit _the bottom of the_ rift valley 
B|4| g: _and then_ _from_ _there_ _go_ over [right] _to the_ _edge_ [of the] [the] [the] western side [of] footbridge 
A|5| M: _but_ [the] _line_ _is_ _just_ too far _to the right_ 
B|6| g: _and then_ _down_ _south_ again 
A|7| M: ok [then] 
B|8| g: _okay_ _so_ [you] don't _have a_ graveyard _do you_ _have _a_ fast_ flowing _river_ 
A|9| M: [the] _two_ little _wheatfields_ 
B|10| g: _up_ _the map_ _you'll_ [then] _come to_ an abandoned cottage _it_ should _be on_ your left-hand side 
A|11| M: _no i_ mean _like a_ little _bit_ [down] 
B|12| g: [to] _to the right of_ concealed hideout 
A|13| M: _yeah_ _i_ know . _but_ im _just_ saying _that_ _i_ [have] [come [to] the right] place . 
B|14| g: "the ""e"" _in_ village sorry"

A|17| M: [the] _curve_ _is_ [a] little steep _for_ me 
B|18| g: [right] [right] [have] _you got_ [the] concealed hideout 
A|19| M: _now_ _it's_ _at _the_ bottom of the_ screen 
B|20| g: [right] you're _going_ [to] [go] straight [down] eh straight [down] [to the] crane _bay_ 
A|21| M: u [have a] _boat_ 
B|22| g: ah [right] [right] head [down] [the right] sand hand side [of the] paper _and_ [curve] underneath [the] buffalo 
A|23| M: [you] mean [you] haven't passed [it] ? 
B|24| g: [right] head [down] towards [that] _and then_ [just] [curve] [down] [the] left-hand side [that] 
A|25| M: yes sir 
B|26| g: uh-huh _okay_ _and then_ _do you_ [have] _anything_ underneath pine grove 
A|27| M: _no_ _it's_ [a] long _way_ [to the right] 
B|28| g: _and_ [you] follow [a] sort [of] [curve] ehm _how_ _do you_ describe [the] last [south] sort [of] _from_ [go] _in_ [a] 
A|29| M: i'm gonna try [and] _get_ [there] 
B|30| g: _okay_ [and] _that's_ [you] 
A|31| M: _i_ dont _see_ [anything] 
B|32| g: [you] don't [have a] forge _well_ [the] forge [is] eh _below the_ [the] cliffs say _about_ [two] inches [down] _okay_ _so_ [you] [go] _from_ [the] start slightly [to] your [right] [down] [the] [way] [right] [a] [curve] 
A|33| M: [so] ... [how] far _can_ _i_ [go] ? 
B|34| g: [of the] fallen pillars [yeah] um [now] [go] [down] [two] _or_ three centimetres 
A|35| M: _i_ dont know _where_ _i_ am _i_ dont know what _i_ am doing _i_ am [just] [in] [the right] place 
B|36| g: [right] _do you_ _have the_ cobbled street

A|39| M: i'm [in] _the boat_ _with_ [you] . 
B|40| g: _and then_ draw [a] [line] straight _between_ _this_ point [and] maybe _about_ half [a] centimetre [to the] west [of [the] bottom of the] white [mountain] 
A|41| M: _its_ [a] _bit_ further [away] _but_ _it's_ [a] little further 
B|42| g: [is] [that] [right] 
A|43| M: canoe [or] canoes ? 
B|44| g: route [but] eh 
A|45| M: ok [well] ill [be on] later today _if_ [you] still _want_ [to] trade 
B|46| g: [can] [you] manage [that] 
A|47| M: yes [and] i'm not _near the_ pinegrove 
B|48| g: [no i] [want] [you] [to] [go to [the] boat] house [on] your [right] [on] your [on] your _left_ 
A|49| M: [i] [have a] pool [to the right [of] the] saloons bar 
B|50| g: _do you_ [see] [where] there's [where] [the] coastline comes round [it's] um there's [a] sort [of] [like] jutting out [bit] there's [like a] point 
A|51| M: [yeah] i've [got] [a] _diamond mine_ [and] [it's] [in] _the diamond_ mines 
B|52| g: until [you] [get] [to the] hot wells 
A|53| M: [the] rift valley [is] [the] rift [river] 
B|54| g: [a] pine grove uh-huh 
A|55| M: i'm _pretty_ sure [that's] not [it] . 
B|56| g: [to the right of] [them] 
A|57| M: [you got] [a fast] running [river] ? 
B|58| g: [you] don't [have a] trig point 
A|59| M: u are [a] little slow 
B|60| g: [right] [and] eh [then] [it's] sort [of] [have] [you got] [wheatfields] 
A|61| M: [that's] [the] [bay] . 
B|62| g: [well] _okay_ _do you_ [have] any flat rocks 
A|63| M: oh [okay] 
B|64| g: [right] [have] [you got] _the lake_ 
A|65| M: [the] only thing [i] [can] think [of] [is] _the diamond_ mining part 
B|66| g: [so] [that] you're _about_ [in] [line] [with] [the bottom of the] water 
A|67| M: [you] can't _change_ [the map] ... 
B|68| g: [is] [there] 
A|69| M: nah [it's] [the] slope [on] [the] [left] 
B|70| g: [no] don't [go] over _the top of_ [them] 
A|71| M: what [is] [the] best [way] [to] [do] [that] ? 
B|72| g: [right] [at] _about_ [at the] level _of _the top_ of the_ fort [right] [in] [line] [with] _the top of the_ fort 
A|73| M: [left] [is] [the] [left] [edge] 
B|74| g: you're [just] you're [just] you're _going_ [down] [but] also [to the right] you're you're 
A|75| M: yes [and then] 
B|76| g: [and] _up_ again [and] you're [pretty] [near the] [edge] [of the] page 
A|77| M: [i] am drawing [a] face [i] think 
B|78| g: should [be] [now] [yeah] [if] your line's _below [the_ [diamond] mine] [you] should [be] [okay] 
A|79| M: [just] wait till [i] [get] back 
B|80| g: [right] [i] don't [have] [that] 
A|81| M: he walks past [the] door [and] gets [in] 
B|82| g: [right] [then] pass pass _below the_ ghost town 
A|83| M: yes [i] [have the] red one 
B|84| g: [well] [you] weren't meant [to] 
A|85| M: [i] dont think [so] 
B|86| g: mmhmm [now] [go] _up_ _about_ [two] [and] [a] half inches _do you_ [have] [anything] above [the] old temple [in] [that] area _up_ [there] 
A|87| M: what [about] [the] trout ? 
B|88| g: without actually coming into contact [with] [them] 
A|89| M: [on] [the top of the] [mountain] 
B|90| g: keeping [it] always [on] your [left] 
A|91| M: ok [so] i'll [just] leave [the] antelopes [and] [the] antels [to the] [left] [of [the] lake] ? 
B|92| g: [to] avoid [the] cobbled street [there] [and] _do you_ [have a] remote village 
A|93| M: [is] [this] [a] joke 
B|94| g: [okay] you're 
A|95| M: what [do you] mean 
B|96| g: [no] [well] [yeah] slightly [to] _its right_ there's some stone slabs 
A|97| M: i'm [right] handed 
B|98| g: [right] [that's] [it] finished 
A|99| M: [just] [go] [between] [the] [two] 
B|100| g: [and then] _up_ north 
A|101| M: theres [a] little waterfall [going] [up] [from] [a] [bit] [of the top] [right] corner 
B|102| g: uh-huh 
A|103| M: i'm [pretty] sure [that's] [the] end . 
B|104| g: [and then] 
A|105| M: [its right] [below the] beach 
B|106| g: [right] [and then] [the] path [the] path starts again [at the] other side [of the] footbridge [now] [do you] [have a] poisoned stream [there] 
A|107| M: [the] rocket part ? 
B|108| g: [and then] [change] [to] [going] due north [for] [about] three inches 
A|109| M: [you'll] [be] fine .
