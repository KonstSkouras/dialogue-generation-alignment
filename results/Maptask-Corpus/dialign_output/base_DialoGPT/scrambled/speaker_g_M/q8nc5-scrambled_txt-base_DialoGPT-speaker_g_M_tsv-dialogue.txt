B|18| g: _go to_ [your] [left] 'til [you're] uh ah until [you're] level _and then_ _south_ _so_ _that you're_ [just] underneath [it] [you] should _be_ [above] [it] 
A|19| M: [okay] [then] 
B|20| g: "go keep _going_ [up] 'til [you're] _about_ _an_ inch below [the] ""x"" marks finish _which_ [i don't know] _if_ [you] have"
