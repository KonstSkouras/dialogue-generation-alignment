B|22| g: mmhmm 
A|23| M: i'll _be_ _on_ my way 
B|24| g: _now_ _you _turn_ left_ towards [the middle of the] page 
A|25| M: i'm _trying to_ get [to the] _point_ [where] [i] _want to_ hit [a] guy [right] _in the_ face 
B|26| g: _you_ [have] well _just_ _go [down_ the] left-hand side [of the] pine forest 
A|27| M: how [do] [i] [do] [that] 
B|28| g: _just_ [down] _at the_ side _just_ [straight down] 
A|29| M: [i] _have a_ lot [of] [them] 
B|30| g: [right] well _it_ doesn't doesn't matter 
A|31| M: [it's] [a] [ravine] . 
B|32| g: _you_ _got_ [to] you've _got_ [to] pass below [the] flat rocks 
A|33| M: how [do you] get [that] ? 
B|34| g: [no] 
A|35| M: [and] [the] face [of the] tree 
B|36| g: uh-huh _and then_ _back_ [to _the] left_ 
A|37| M: [yes] [and] [no] 
B|38| g: _okay_ er _the lake_ should [have a] [a] bulge [in] _it_ _just_ _at the top_ 
A|39| M: [you] _can_ [go] into [the] caravan [and go] through [the] door _and then go_ through [it] again 
B|40| g: [and then _go] straight_ across another inch [and] [that's the] finish 
A|41| M: [right] [and then go] backwards [to the] [back] [of the] truck 
B|42| g: _keep_ [going] 
A|43| M: [the lake] 
B|44| g: [right] 
A|45| M: [then] [turn left] ! 
B|46| g: well uh _i think_ [you're] probably [trying to] avoid [that] _so_ _if you_ _go down_ um [and then] [left] _in a_ sort [of] _curve_ 
A|47| M: [you're] wrong [it's] three hundred [and] sixty 
B|48| g: [go] [go] [back] _so_ [that] you'll _just_ miss [the] remote _village_ _if _you_ come_ south 
A|49| M: i'm sure [it's] not [but] i'm sure [you] could tell [from the] way [it's] shaped . 
B|50| g: aye aye 
A|51| M: [okay] [just] [keep] [it] up i'm not [a] _big_ fan [of the] bandits [i] prefer [the] way [the] band _is_ laid out . 
B|52| g: [to] its [left] well [that's] [a] [a] [stone] ss 
A|53| M: u [got] 2 btw 
B|54| g: [you] [want to] [just] [go] over _the top_ [of] [that] [and] round 
A|55| M: i'll _be_ _there_ [in a] minute 
B|56| g: _so_ [the] abandoned cottage should _now_ [be] below [you] [on] [the] map 
A|57| M: [no] [stone creek] ? 
B|58| g: uh [do you] [have a] rope bridge 
A|59| M: [you're] _in the_ wrong country . 
B|60| g: you've [got] [a] bay [there] 
A|61| M: _so you_ _can_ get [to the] museum [of] freedom 
B|62| g: [no] 
A|63| M: _but what_ [if [you] turn] [right] ? 
B|64| g: [okay] [and then] [just] like [a] nice [big] _curve_ heading [down] about six inches 
A|65| M: [of the] _camp_ 
B|66| g: [okay] well [i] haven't [got] [that] [but what] [you] _what _you're_ [going_ _to] do_ [is] _you're [going_ to] [right] you've [got] we've [got] another _curve_ [on] [the] _line_ [so] this [is] probably why [you're] curving [to] avoid [that] avalanche [so you] _curve_ first [of] all [to the] [right] 
A|67| M: [the] whole _thing_ [is] [a] lie 
B|68| g: [the] remote _village_ [is] about 
A|69| M: [yes] [there] [is] 
B|70| g: mmhmm 
A|71| M: [come] [to the] [village] 
B|72| g: [right] [okay] [then] [right] _you're [going_ to] [go] below [the] diamond mine 
A|73| M: i'll let [you] know _when_ i'm ready 
B|74| g: [a] totem pole sort [of] [thing] 
A|75| M: [then] [curve] 
B|76| g: _now_ [do you] [have a] footbridge 
A|77| M: [no] im pretty sure [i] am 
B|78| g: [it's] [it's] [in the] finishing [point] 
A|79| M: [it] [is] [a] _bit_ hard [to] read 
B|80| g: [okay] [if you] [if you] [just] kind [of] draw [a] draw an arc er [to the] [right] [just] _more_ or less [the] same direction as you've [been] [going] until [have] [you] [got] wheatfields 
A|81| M: i'll [be] [the] guy who goes [to [the] lake] [and] takes [the] water 
B|82| g: [right] [do you] [have a] cobbled street 
A|83| M: [the left] [one] 
B|84| g: imagine [a] [a] triangle [with] ehm an equilateral triangle _with the_ pebbled shore flagship [and] finish [right] [can] [you] 
A|85| M: i'll [go] up [there] [and] [do] [it] for [you] 
B|86| g: [you] [no] [got] two fenced meadows

A|89| M: [you come] [straight] up [and] [down] 
B|90| g: [right] [go] south past buffalo 
A|91| M: [i think] [it's] [more] [to do] [with the] angle [of the] picture 
B|92| g: well [do you] [have] an apache [camp] 
A|93| M: [then] [turn] [right] 
B|94| g: crane bay 
A|95| M: [i] [can] try [to] get [a] pic [of it] 
B|96| g: horizontally sorry 
A|97| M: [so] [what you're] saying _is that_ [the top] [is] my house ? 
B|98| g: [right] [no] below [the] flat rocks 
A|99| M: [you] [are] [going to] [have] [to] leave 
B|100| g: "sort [of] ""c"" shape [to] cover [the bottom of] [a] ""c"" [right] [from] [when] [you] pass [down] below [the] walled city" 
A|101| M: [now] [you're going] into [the] wrong bar 
B|102| g: [the] outside [of the] page [and then] eh sort [of] draw [a] [are] [you] about _in line_ [with the] rocket [bit] or [have] [you] done [that] 
A|103| M: [i] [have a] boat house . 
B|104| g: [no] [but] like [see where] your _line_ [is] _at the_ side [of the] page [is that] _at_ rocket like [where] [the] words rocket [are] written 
A|105| M: [just] don't [go] [in] too [far] 
B|106| g: [do you] [have] concealed hideout 
A|107| M: [go straight] up [then [go] down] 
B|108| g: [and] [stone] slabs 
A|109| M: [right] [in line] [at the top] 
B|110| g: [right] [okay] 
A|111| M: [i] [have a] fire 
B|112| g: [right] [okay] [right] [what] [you] [do] [then] [is] [you] [go] south [from the] walled city
