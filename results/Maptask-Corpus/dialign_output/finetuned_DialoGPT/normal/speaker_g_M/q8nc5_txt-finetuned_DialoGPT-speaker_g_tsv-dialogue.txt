A|62| M: uh [i'm] [going to [go] [down] [to the] left] [first] [then]

B|69| g: [right] [what] happens is [you] [go] [you] [curve] [to the] _right _and_ then back_ into [the left] [and then you] [curve] [to the] [right] again _along_ _the top of_ this _concealed_ hideout 
A|70| M: [so you're] basically [in a] [line] [with the] end _of the concealed_ _out_ _of it_ 
B|71| g: _no_ 
A|72| M: [right] 
B|73| g: _no_ 
A|74| M: [right so] [i'm] [going down]

A|76| M: [right okay] 
B|77| g: [mmhmm] 
A|78| M: [and then [you're] just] [going] [up] [the] [side _of] it_ [okay] 
B|79| g: 'til [you've] [sort of] curved [to the] [right] [then] [to the left] _and then back_ [out] [to the] [right] again

A|88| M: ok 
B|89| g: [no] _bottom_ _right-hand_ _corner of the_ boat house
