A|48| M: _right okay_ [right] 
B|49| g: you're drawing [a] nose [right] say this is [the] face you're drawing [and] then you've [got] _to_ sort [of] do [a] sort [of] _round_ bit for [the] nose 
A|50| M: [round] 
B|51| g: beneath [the] pine forest _uh-huh_ 
A|52| M: [right] 
B|53| g: [right] have [you] _got a bakery_ underneath [right] [a] bit lower [down]

B|63| g: _uh-huh_ [and] then come [right] back [in] 
A|64| M: mmhmm 
B|65| g: underneath [the bakery] [and] maybe [in] past [the bakery] about _two_ centimetres [just] before [the] canal have [you] [got a] canal

A|82| M: [uh-huh] 
B|83| g: mm [right okay] is that sort [of] above [the] _lighthouse_ 
A|84| M: [uh-huh] 
B|85| g: [right] well sort [of] sticking _to the_ coast [you] know _where the_ coast goes up [and] [down] vertical 
A|86| M: _yes_ [uh-huh] 
B|87| g: [right] sort [of] [don't] [go] vertically [down] _it_ but start sloping [down] towards around [the] top [of the] rocket warehouse 
A|88| M: [right] 
B|89| g: [uh-huh] 
A|90| M: [right] 
B|91| g: [and] then slope [the] line [right] out _to _the_ side_ [of the] page

B|93| g: [uh-huh] 
A|94| M: [okay] 
B|95| g: [the] outside [of the] page [and] then eh sort [of] draw [a] are [you] about [in] line with [the] rocket bit or have [you] done that 
A|96| M: [yeah] i've [got] [it] [yeah] 
B|97| g: [no] but like see _where_ your line is [at _the] side_ [of the] page is that [at] rocket like _where the_ words rocket are written 
A|98| M: uh-uh [yeah] 
B|99| g: [right so] we [just] like take [the] line [down] vertically [down] _the side_ [of the] page 
A|100| M: [uh-huh] 
B|101| g: for about _two_ centimetres 
A|102| M: [to the left] 
B|103| g: [and] then curve [it] back [in] towards _the old_ light house [don't] have [a] _cave_ 
A|104| M: [right] ehm [go round the] [cave] ehm [round [the] side] [where the] [two] bits meet [and] [go] [to _the] old lighthouse_
