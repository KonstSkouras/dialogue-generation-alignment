A|0| M: _yeah_ 
B|1| g: _you_ don't have _a forge_ _well_ _the_ _forge_ is eh _below _the_ _the_ cliffs_ say _about two inches_ _down_ _okay_ _so_ _you_ _go_ from _the_ start _slightly_ _to_ your _right_ _down_ _the_ way _right_ _a_ curve 
A|2| M: mm [right] 
B|3| g: _to the bottom of _the_ cliffs_ 
A|4| M: uh _i've _got_ [a_ forge] _about two and a half inches_ [below the] cliff _what_ _do you_ want me [to] _do_ 
B|5| g: [and] then [you] start [to] _go_ _left_ _go_ [about] _half an inch_ out _to the left_ [and] [and] _down_ [about] [you] know [two and a half inches] three [inches] 
A|6| M: _mmhmm_ 
B|7| g: _an inch_ [and a half] if [you] draw that line _down_ you'll be _on the_ left-hand side _of the_ [forge] [you] don't have [a forge] _but_ there is one there 
A|8| M: [right] i'm _on the right-hand_ 
B|9| g: _so_ now _you're_ [about] 
A|10| M: _i've _got_ [a_ forge] [about two inches] [below [the] _cliffs] okay_ 
B|11| g: [you] should really end up [about] four [inches] _down_ from _the the_ cross _er_ [you] know in [the] same line like _just_ beneath _it_ in fact four [inches] _down_ [okay] 
A|12| M: [right] [okay] 
B|13| g: _no no_ 
A|14| M: "right [well] i'll _tell you_ _what_ [right] [you're] _under the_ ""t"" [of] cliffs" 
B|15| g: _no_ [the] initial line from [the] cross 
A|16| M: [right] 
B|17| g: goes [right] _but_ _it_ doesn't _go_ as far [right] as [the cliffs] 
A|18| M: _oh_ [right] 
B|19| g: _it_ goes _down to_ where _it_ says [cliffs okay] 
A|20| M: [right] 
B|21| g: _about a_ centimetre from where _it_ says [cliffs] _to the_ left-hand side _of it_ [okay] then [you] _go_ back _left_ _slightly_ until [you're] beneath _the the_ start [and] _down_ [you] know [two] _or_ three [inches] until [you're] 
A|22| M: uh [right] [okay] 
B|23| g: [yeah] 
A|24| M: [okay] 
B|25| g: until [you're] [about] [you] know four [inches] _or_ four [and a half inches] _or_ _so_ _down_ from [the] start 
A|26| M: [right] [okay] 
B|27| g: [do you] have _an_ _old_ _pine_ 
A|28| M: [yeah] 
B|29| g: [yeah] [a] single _old_ _pine_ 
A|30| M: [yeah] [okay] 
B|31| g: [and] _down_ _down_ as far as that [okay] 
A|32| M: [okay] 
B|33| g: _but_ [you] know beneath [the] start 
A|34| M: uh [yeah] 
B|35| g: _so_ then [you] _go right_ which would be [under the] [forge] [and] [you] _go_ up over _the old_ _pine_ [okay] 
A|36| M: [so] _i_ [go right] _underneath_ [it] 
B|37| g: over _the pine_ 
A|38| M: [yeah] 
B|39| g: [yeah] _more or less_ 
A|40| M: [more or less] [yeah] 
B|41| g: as as long as [you] avoid [the] [forge] [and] _the pine_ [you] [you] don't have [to] 
A|42| M: [right] 
B|43| g: worry too much [about] [the] exact 
A|44| M: [well] _i've _got_ [a_ forge] _about two inches _to the_ left _of_ the pine_ [so] 
B|45| g: route _but_ eh 
A|46| M: [so] _i_ _go [down_ [to] _the bottom of the] pine_ grove 
B|47| g: _right so_ once [you're] _at _the_ top [of the_ pine] if [you] [go] [about two and a half inches] three _inches to the right_ have _you got a_ [pine] forest 
A|48| M: _uh-huh_ 
B|49| g: [you] have [well] _just_ [go down] [the] left-hand side [of the pine] forest 
A|50| M: [right] 
B|51| g: you've [got a] bay there 
A|52| M: yes 
B|53| g: [i] don't have [a] bay there it'll be _at _the_ top_ 
A|54| M: [right] [okay] 
B|55| g: have _you got a_ bay _at [the_ bottom] 
A|56| M: uh _i've got_ [an] apache camp _it's it's_ [below the] apache 
B|57| g: crane bay 
A|58| M: _yeah well_ head [down] _past the_ centre [of the] _map_ _past [the_ bottom [of] it] 
B|59| g: where's [the] one _at _the_ top_ 
A|60| M: _it's_ [at [the] [the] top _of the] page_ [right] 
B|61| g: how far [down] 
A|62| M: [about two] centimetres 
B|63| g: [yeah well] don't [go] much [you] know don't [go] any higher than than [the the] height _of the old_ [pine] [or] [or] [the] forest that must be where [the] bay is [i] don't have [a] bay there _but_ [the] route [you] know must miss [the] bay _er_ [so] [you] know _just_ [go] along 'til [you] get [to [the] pine] forest [more or less] [and] then [go] [go down] [on the] left-hand side [of the pine] forest 
A|64| M: [right] 
B|65| g: [okay] once [you're] [at [the] bottom of the pine] forest _just_ where [it] says [pine] 
A|66| M: [right] [okay] 
B|67| g: [okay] if [you] if [you] _just_ kind [of] draw [a] draw [an] arc _er_ _to the right_ _just_ [more or less] [the] same direction as you've been _going_ until have _you got_ wheatfields 
A|68| M: [right] [okay] 
B|69| g: [on] your [map] _no_ [well] [the] 
A|70| M: [yeah] 
B|71| g: [you] have [right] 
A|72| M: [yeah] 
B|73| g: [well] _just_ draw [the] arc [and] stop [the] arc [you] know in line with [the] wheatfields _but_ beneath [the pine] forest [okay] 
A|74| M: mm 
B|75| g: [oh] [two] [or] three [inches] [down] from [the pine] forest [okay] [you] know [it] doesn't have [to] be [an] arc as long as [you] avoid all [the] obstacles [i] think eh if [you] [you] know if [you] finish up eh in line with [the] wheatfields [okay] _but_ beneath [the pine] forest [you] if [you] stop drawing your line there above _the bakery_ in other words above [the] eh 
A|76| M: [right] 
B|77| g: [well] _er_ [you] know imagine where [the] [forge] would be [on] your [map] [or] [it's it's] [on] mine _but_ imagine where [it] would be 
A|78| M: [right] 
B|79| g: [about two inches] [down] from that in in between [the the] [forge] [and] _the old_ [pine] 
A|80| M: mm 
B|81| g: [on the] left-hand side [okay] [so] where are [you] now 
A|82| M: ehm _about two [inches to the_ right] [of the old] temple 
B|83| g: [mmhmm] _no _no_ no_ 
A|84| M: [right] [okay] 
B|85| g: _no_ don't worry [about] [the] wheatfields [it's] _just_ [to] [tell you] where [to] stop [the] line 
A|86| M: [right] 
B|87| g: never mind [about] [it] being [an] arc [or] [a] curve [or] anything 
A|88| M: [no no] [just] straight [down] 
B|89| g: [just] [just] [go down] [the] left-hand side [of the pine] forest 
A|90| M: [right] 
B|91| g: [okay] [and] once [you] get [to the] where [it] says [pine] draw [a] line from there [to] eh above _the bakery_ _but_ not [the] chimney [a] bit [to the left of] that in fact [the] left-hand side [it] must be [a] wee shed [or] whatever [it] is 
A|92| M: [right so] i'm [going] [down [to] the] level [of [the] bottom _of the] bakery_ 
B|93| g: [you] see [what] [i] 
A|94| M:  !!! ' !!! ' !! there's [a] tree 
B|95| g: [yeah] _but_ stop when [you] get [just] [to] above [the bakery] 
A|96| M: [right] [okay] [right] 
B|97| g: then [just] [go] round [the bakery] [on the right-hand] side [just] draw [a] [an] oval shape round [the right-hand] side [of the bakery] 
A|98| M: [mmhmm] 
B|99| g: [yeah] [right] round [it] [uh-huh] 
A|100| M: [right] 
B|101| g: [underneath] [the bakery] 
A|102| M: [no] 
B|103| g: have _you got a_ canal 
A|104| M: [no] 
B|105| g: [no] [well] [the] canal is [about two inches to the] left-hand side [of the bakery] _but_ [it's] in line with [it] [so] once [you] get _an inch_ [or] [and a half] [or] [so] [past [the] bakery] 
A|106| M: [right] [okay] 
B|107| g: eh take your line [down to] crane bay [oh] [i've got] [two] wheatfields that's not important is [it] [right] anyway [so] [you] get [to the] canal [right] [you] don't have one _but_ [just] [go down] [about two inches] until [you] get [to] crane bay [and] follow follow [the] curve [okay] [of] crane bay 
A|108| M: mm 
B|109| g: _but_ not don't [go down] [just] [go] along don't [go] don't [go down] where [it] [it] really curves away there don't don't follow that 
A|110| M: [right] [okay] 
B|111| g: [so] [you're] [at [the] top] left-hand side [of] crane bay [right] [just] northwest [of] where [it] says crane 
A|112| M: [right] i'm [just] [about] [at the] left-most [er] there's [about [a] [half] an inch] [to the right] 
B|113| g: "or [the] where [the] ""c"" is" 
A|114| M: uh [right] 
B|115| g: [i've got] wheatfields in line with where [it] says bay [okay] [about] [an inch] [or] [so] [to the left of] crane bay itself [just] in line in fact beneath where [the] other wheatfields were that [i] that [i] was telling [you] [about] 
A|116| M: [right] 
B|117| g: [okay] [so] [you] [go] round [the] round that curve [and] [you] have [to] [go down] [and] [about] [an inch] [and a half] [okay] [to] [to] avoid [the] wheatfields which are [just] [to the left of] crane bay [so] [you] [go down] there [right] 
A|118| M: [right] 
B|119| g: [go] beneath [the] wheatfields in other words draw [a] line [you] know [two inches] [or] [so] [to the left] have _you got a rocket warehouse_ 
A|120| M: [uh-huh] 
B|121| g: [well] [just] draw [a] line between [well] above [the] _rocket warehouse_ in fact [okay] 
A|122| M: uh [right] 
B|123| g: [an] [an inch] [or] [so] above [the] _rocket warehouse_ _but_ [to the left [of] it] [go] round [it] [the] same way as [you] went round [the] igloo _but_ [on the] other side [okay] [just] follow [it] round 
A|124| M: [right] 
B|125| g: [go down] [the] left-hand side [of the page] once you've done that 
A|126| M: uh [right] 
B|127| g: have _you got _a_ lighthouse_ 
A|128| M: uh [a lighthouse] [no] 
B|129| g: [the] _rocket warehouse_ 
A|130| M: uh [rocket warehouse] uh-hope [so] 
B|131| g: [the] cross is [right] next [to the] [lighthouse] [and] [just] take your line [to] there [and] that's [it] finished 
A|132| M: [right] 
B|133| g: [on the] left-hand side [of it] 
A|134| M: uh [well] [it's] sort [of] [on the right-hand] [but] very [slightly] [on [the] left] 
B|135| g: [well] [yeah] that would be [okay] 
A|136| M: [right] 
B|137| g: [uh-huh] [and] [just] [the] cross is [right] [you] know [the] left-hand side [of the] [lighthouse] [just] next [to] [it] 
A|138| M: uh [yeah] 
B|139| g: [okay] [got] [it] 
A|140| M: [you got a rocket warehouse]
