A|28| B: gosh . 
B|29| M: [yeah .] 
A|30| B: [yeah] 
B|31| M: _and , uh_ . 
A|32| B: [yeah .] 
B|33| M: _and_ _so ,_ 
A|34| B: _well [,_ we've] been married [for] five [and a half] _years_ [and we] started [out] without kids , [of] course [, and] found [it] much easier [to] save [and] used [to do] _a lot_ _more_ fun kinds [of] [of] things [and , uh ,] [did] really [, um] [, you know ,] [have _a] real_ strict [but ,] budget [but , uh ,] [the] [about] [and] [to] [our] , when [we] first [got] married [we were] [in] graduate school [and we were] [just] [, you know ,] dirt poor . [then] when [we] [got] [our] first jobs after [about] [a year] [of] marriage [we] decided we'd bank [my] salary [so we] could [buy a house] . [so [,] we] virtually [did] [that] [for] [about] two _years ,_ which worked _real_ _well [,_ [and] then] moved from [california] where [we] realized [we] could never [buy a house] anyway _no_ matter how much [we] saved [, and] moved [to] texas , bought [a house] immediately [, you know ,] which , [of] course , _is now_ devalued [with] [the] housing market , 
B|35| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| B: [so [,] i] don't [know] if [we , we did] _a good_ thing [to buy a house] or [not] [but] [at] least [we've] [got a] place [to] live . [um] [, [so] ,] _now_ , since [, uh , we] [have a] three [year] old [and a] two [year] old _now_ [, um] , 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|39| M: [and , uh] . 
A|40| B: that's , that's [, that] threw [our] budget really [out] [of] whack too . an [we [,] um] , [have] been [just] forced [to] budget much _more_ because [i] quit working [to] be home [with] [the] kids . [and , um] [, we] [just] really [have] [, _uh ,] i_ don't [know [,] we , we've] tried [different] times [, we've] done [like] [a] survey [of] [like] taking [, you know ,] [the] past three months [of] where [all] [the money] [went] . 
B|41| M: [um] . 
A|42| B: [and we] really don't spend on anything much [of] [a] luxury or anything [at] [all] , [but] [it] seems [like] there's [, um] , times when [we] [just] [have] [to] _get_ [out] where we'll [go and] [like] _get_ [a] baby-sitter [and] we'll [go and] we'll blow [, you know ,] fifty , sixty dollars [in] _one_ night [going] [out] [to] eat , [going to] [a] show or _doing_ _something_ [, you know] . 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: "yeah , that's [the] hard part because when [we] sit down [to] make [it [,] we] try [to] make [it] _real_ spartan [and] _real_ narrow [so we] _can_ [put] [a] certain amount [in] [savings] every week [and then] _it's not_ really [that] realistic because [we] [do] find [that] [we] want [to] [go and] [do] _something_ or splurge [for [,] you know ,] birthday [for] somebody or [, you know ,] even [we , we] even [do] things _real_ frugally [for] [the] kids [, we] _get_ _a lot_ [of] toys [and] clothes [and] [stuff] [at] garage sales or from friends because they don't [know] [the] difference [at] [this] age [, you know ,] whether _they're_ jordache new or whether _they're_ *listen; ""because"" may start new utt unit [you know ,] something" 
B|45| M: [uh , _i] guess_ _so ._ 
A|46| B: [and] _they're_ both boys [so] they [just] _one_ [year] after [the] other [in] each other's clothes [, [so] .] _but , um_ , that's [the] hardest part [for] us _is_ [that] [it's] really [, um] [, you know ,] _budgeting_ [and] some extra things [, you know [,] that] are _more_ [, you know ,] nonessential items . 
B|47| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: [and , uh] [i] [, i] would say [that] [in] [the] situation [that] [it] [is now] [it's] [more] important _to have_ [the] time _to ,_ [to] deal [with] [that] [budgeting] , _as_ far _as_ [, uh] . 
A|50| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] [uh-huh .] 
B|51| M: [but , um] . 
A|52| B: on your friends , that's true , that's true . _well [,_ we] [have] [so] many unexpected things come up [so] often [it] seems _with [,_ we] both [have] older cars [and] _something_ will come up [and] wind up having [to] spend [a] thousand dollars [, you know ,] on [the car] [in] two months or _something_ , 
B|53| M: right . right . 
A|54| B: [and , you know _,] _a_ lot_ [of] things [like] [that] [that] really are hard [to] plan [for] . [and , uh ,] 
B|55| M: [well [,] that] [, that] [is] [a] big [one] . [i] [, i] think [that] [, uh] [you know [,] you] [can] [have [a] good] career [and [,] [and] , uh] [and [,] i] [know] [that] [a lot] [, [a] good] portion _of the_ people [that] [i] work [with [,] uh] ... 
A|56| B: [yeah] , [kind of] [put] [in] [a] certain amount per [year] , *82 [and] 84 same utt ? 
B|57| M: right . 
A|58| B: you're [going [to] have] on extra expenses [for] [car] . 
B|59| M: right , right . 
A|60| B: [yeah] _, yeah ._ 
B|61| M: [so ,] [it's _not] [a_ real] , [it] isn't [a real] big problem . [i] mean , [it ,] [it] [is] [something] [that] [i] [have] noticed [, uh [,] that] [i] notice [in] [the] _last_ couple [of] [years [,] uh] . 
A|62| B: [yeah] [our] biggest way [of] saving [money] [is] [then] [to] stop [all] these deductions [, um] [, you know ,] [is] [to ,] let's see , [now] [, i] forget which way [we] [do] [it .] [we] don't list [all] [the] deductions [and then we] _get_ [more] [money] back [, you know ,] [at] [the] end [of the] [year] , 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [so ,] that's [not [a] good] way [to] 
B|65| M: [no] [, that] isn't [a good] idea . 
A|66| B: that's [what] [my] husband said [, so] [this last year] he changed [it ,] [of] course [, we] didn't _get_ hardly [and then] nearly [as] much back [and] [it was like] _oh ,_ [no] . better find another way [of] saving [money] 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [yeah .] 
B|69| M: [but ,] 
A|70| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|71| M: [and , uh] . 
A|72| B: [yeah] , because [we] don't miss [it [,] we] really don't , when _it's just_ taking [out] [of the] paycheck [and] [stuff] [, [so] .] [but] [we're] trying [to] [put] [a] little [money] away [for] [the] kids because [we] [can] envision [the [, uh] ,] expenses [for] college already [, you know ,] eighteen [years] away or whatever . 
B|73| M: [oh [,] yeah .] 
A|74| B: gosh . 
B|75| M: [and , uh] [they're] , [they're] [doing] [this] [in] [the] fall . [it's just] [for] those interested [in] [it .] 
A|76| B: [i guess] , 
B|77| M: [it's just] [not] , [it's not] , 
A|78| B: that's fantastic . [yeah] 
B|79| M: [and] i'm sure [that] she's , i'm hoping [that] she'll , she'll [get] around [to] [it .] 
A|80| B: [well [,] i] enjoyed talking [to] [you] too , [good] luck [and] don't spend any [money] [this] weekend
