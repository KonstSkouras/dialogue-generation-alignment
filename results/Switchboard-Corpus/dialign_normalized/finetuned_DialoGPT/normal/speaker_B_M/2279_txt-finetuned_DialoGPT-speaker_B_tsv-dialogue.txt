B|38| M: uh-huh . 
A|39| B: [and] [that] _was_ [the] most boring _place_ [on] earth .

A|41| B: [yeah .] did [uh] did [like] did _you_ [go to] disneyland ? 
B|42| M: yes . 
A|43| B: [oh] okay . [so] [but] [um] now _i don't know_ [but] [um] [but] let's _see_ when _i was_ eleven [i went] also [to the] caribbean . 
B|44| M: uh-huh . 
A|45| B: [and uh] [then] after [that] [i] _my_ sister lives [in] turkey [so] when _i was_ [like] fourteen fifteen [i went] [i went to] turkey . 
B|46| M: uh-huh . 
A|47| B: [and] _this_ christmas [i went to] turkey . [but] basically it's [a] [for] [the] past [couple of years] [i] since _my_ parents _are_ _are_ [well] [i'm] from argentina [and] _my_ parents live down _there_ . [so] _all_ [the] traveling [i] [do] _is_ alone . 
B|48| M:  !!!!!! [oh] !! 
A|49| B: [and uh] _we were_ never much [of] [uh] [a] very [uh] family thing _you know_ made [like] [go] skiing [in] vermont _or_ something . 
B|50| M: [um .] 
A|51| B: [that] _was_ [uh] [that] _was_ [a lot of] fun . 
B|52| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|53| B: [but] _what happens_ _is_ [we] used [to] fight [a lot] [so] there's never much _of a_ family family thing . _you know_ one [of] those hell family vacations . 
B|54| M: [right .] 
A|55| B: [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [and [and] and] [we] _try _to_ go_ over _there and_ [we] [go] over [to] grand canyon [and] [we] [do] [that] . 
A|57| B: [yeah .] 
B|58| M: [so] [we were] really [in] kind [of a] rough spot [you] couldn't really _make_ [a] living _at_ _it_ . 
A|59| B: [well] _my_ dad _all_ he _all_ he wanted [to] [do] _was_ get money [for] us [so] he could _buy_ us material [things] . 
B|60| M: _yeah [yeah_ .] 
A|61| B: [and and] [to] me _you know_ it's [like] now [i'm] twenty-two [but] [i] still feel _you know_ it's [like] [yeah] [we] never threw [a] football _or_ something 
B|62| M: [right .] 
A|63| B: [and] [the] way _i was_ brought up [and] he wants me now he [like] he _you know_ [like] he wants [to] _be_ best friends now 
B|64| M: [uh] . 
A|65| B: [and] it's very hard [for] me because _you know_ it's [like] [you] grow up [to] _be_ twenty [years] old [and] it's _always_ [the] same man 
B|66| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|67| B: [and then] suddenly he sees [that] _he's_ getting old [and] he wants [to] _be_ best friends 
B|68| M: [uh] . 
A|69| B: [but uh] _you know_ it's [like] [i] can only express myself [so] much because _you know_ [um] everything [that] he taught me _you know_ [that] _my_ family taught me which _is_ very hard [to] change [that] _all_ [of a] sudden from one year [to the] next [and] say [i'm] sorry _you know ._ it's [like] _you know_ [i] love [you] [and] let's [go out] [and] [do] [things] together when _i don't_ feel [like] [it] _you know_ 
B|70| M: _uh that's_ true . 
A|71| B: [and] [so] [that's] [that] whole thing [that] he'll say when [like] [like] _i've_ seen _my_ uncle [and] his family _you know_ does everything together _and you know_ his _kids_ _are_ _you know_ when his [little] girl _was_ five [years] old [and] everything [they [uh] they] _would_ [go to the] beach [and] she could [go to] sleep [at] two [in] [the] morning _you know_ 
B|72| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|73| B: [and [uh] _i] was_ brought up [the] same way [it] doesn't matter _what_ age [you] [have] _just_ [so] long [as] [you] can get up [to [go] to] class [the] next morning [you] can stay up _you know_ 
B|74| M: [right .] 
A|75| B: [but] his _what_ he does _is_ when he gets home he separates his [work] from his house . 
B|76| M: [oh] . 
A|77| B: [yeah .] 
B|78| M: [he's] _got _to_ have a_ [place] [to] store [all] [that] stuff [and [you know] .] 
A|79| B: [yeah .] 
B|80| M: [and you] [just] _have to_ trust their judgment . 
A|81| B: [yeah yeah] [but uh] it's [just] it's [just] something [that] [you know] _my_ theory _is_ [you know] when when [you] [have] _kids_ [and] [all] [you] [you] want [to] [do] [well] _what_ i'll [do] _is_ [you know] [like] [i] mean [you] might [have] problems [but] it's [not] _your_ kids' problems [you know] 
B|82| M: uh-huh . 
A|83| B: [and you] [got to] [try to] _be_ with them [as] much [as] [you] can [and] [to] [you know] [like] thing _is_ _is that_ [you know] [like] _if_ _if_ [they] _would_ ever happen [to have a] drug problem suppose [that] [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] saying [i] [got] [a] problem [you know] 
B|84| M: [right .] 
A|85| B: [and uh and] _that would_ [make] _any_ parent feel good [and] bad [at] [the] same time [you know] 
B|86| M: [right .] 
A|87| B: first [of] [all] _you're_ coming [to] me [and] let's _see_ how [we] can get rid [of] [the] problem [you know] [and] [that's] [uh that's] very [that's] very hard [to] [do] because [once] _you're_ best friends with _your_ parents [then] [i] think everything [go] [a lot] better . 
B|88| M: uh-hums [uh] [uh] . 
A|89| B: [yeah .] 
B|90| M: [and] [we were] [you] [were] [just] sort [of] [like] [well] we'll [just] wait [and] [see] [what happens] [you] [you're] [not] going [to _have] any_ [kids] [in] _college_ . 
A|91| B: [yeah] _my_ _my_ father _was_ raising four [oh] [well] three [kids] before he _had_ me [so] [it] _was_ [uh] [you know] [you're] trying [to] support [uh] four [kids] [and] it's pretty hard [you know] 
B|92| M: [yeah] 
A|93| B: _and i i_ told him listen [you] could [have] _had_ [a lot of] money _if you_ _would_ [have] only _had_ two [kids] . 
B|94| M: [that's] [right .] 
A|95| B: he says [yeah] [but] [then] [i] wouldn't [have] [you] [i go] [yeah] [but] [then] [you] _would_ [have [a] lot of] money 
B|96| M: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|97| B: [yeah .] 
B|98| M: [and] [i'm] sure [that] [that's] [not] going [to] help either . 
A|99| B: [but] [you know] [like] four [i] mean four children _is_ expensive especially when [you] consider [like] especially [for] me which [i'm] paying [out] [of] [state] tuition . [i'm] paying [you know] three thousand _no_ [what] _is_ [it] two thousand six hundred dollars [for] one semester . 
B|100| M: _oh my_ goodness . 
A|101| B: [and you know] people say [you know] it's expensive [to] think it's [college] [but] _if_ _if_ everybody _would be a_ [little] bit responsible [you know] it's [like] [what] does [it] [what] does [it] cost . [it] costs five hundred dollars [a] semester suppose . now [they [go] to] [a] [state] [college] [and they] live [at] home [you know] 
B|102| M: [right .] 
A|103| B: [and] [well] [it] costs two hundred dollars [for] books [but] [you know] seven hundred dollars [a] semester [a lot of] people can spare [that] _if_ [they] planned ahead [you know] [like] 
B|104| M: [uh] . 
A|105| B: [i] mean it's [like] _if you_ plan [a] year ahead [you] can probably save up seven hundred dollars [you know] one thousand four hundred dollars [to] send _your_ child [to] [college] [you know .] 
B|106| M: [right .] 
A|107| B: [oh] [oh] excuse me ? 
B|108| M: what's [your] interest ? 
A|109| B: [well i] [i'm doing] computer science computer engineering . 
B|110| M: [oh] . 
A|111| B: _yeah [and_ and] now [i'm] looking [for a] job before [they have to] send me back home 
B|112| M: [yeah .] 
A|113| B: because since [i'm] [an] international student [they] want [to] send me back [to] argentina . 
B|114| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|115| B: [well] [my] dad wants me [to go] back . [so .] 
B|116| M: [uh [i] don't [know] [.] i i] [uh] [i've] [always] considered going [to] japan . 
A|117| B: _no ._ 
B|118| M: [no] [no] [no .] 
A|119| B: [no] because _if you_ [go] back [there] [then] [you] can never get [out] . 
B|120| M: huh-uh . 
A|121| B: [like] [you] [don't] [have any] money [to] [to] get [out] . 
B|122| M: [yeah [and] i [i] was] wondering [if you] [had] [if you] [were] [to] [buy] [a] car [or] 
A|123| B: [so] [uh [and] [uh] [i] was] thinking [you know] [like] [oh my] god [you know] [i go] back [there [and] then] [and i] get married [there and] now [i] [have] [kids] [there [and] then] i'll never leave [the] [place] [you know .] 
B|124| M: [yeah .] 
A|125| B: [yeah] [i] [know] [and] [that's] [that's] [what] happened [to] [my] brother . he came [to] school up here [and then] when he [went] down [there] he [was] [just] [so] bad off [you know] from [not] being able [to] stay up here [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
B|126| M: uh-huh . 
A|127| B: [so .] 
B|128| M: [well] [that] [that] [is [that] [would] be a] really tough tough situation . 
A|129| B: [yeah] [i've] [been] calling [a lot of] companies . [there] some [of] them _are_ interested . [well] [at] least [for a] year [and] [a] half [i] can [work] 
B|130| M: uh-hums . 
A|131| B: [so .] 
B|132| M: [i'm] [not] sure [i'm] [not] too sure [what] [the] laws [are] pertaining [to] [this] . 
A|133| B: [all] [right] same here . 
B|134| M: _bye-bye ._
