A|29| B: [oh ,] okay _, well ,_ first [, they] _always_ say , get [to] _know_ _your_ country first before _you_ leave [, i] mean [i , i] lived [in] places , [like] 
B|30| M: [oh] . 
A|31| B: when [i] lived [in] washington [, uh ,] washington , d c [, i] never [went [to] the] washington memorial _, [and_ then] when [i went] back [to] visit [, i went [to] the] washington memorial .

A|33| B: _right ._ 
B|34| M: _and [they_ have] their own _little_ club _, and _they_ go_ _and , uh_ . 
A|35| B: _right ._ [well ,] it's , it's [a] beautiful city . 
B|36| M: uh-huh . 
A|37| B: [but ,] [the] problem _is ,_ [like] first time [i went] [out] [of] here [, and they] took me [to] las vegas 
B|38| M: uh-huh . 
A|39| B: [and] [that] _was_ [the] most boring _place_ [on] earth . 
B|40| M: [yeah .] 
A|41| B: [yeah .] did [, uh ,] did , _like ,_ did _you_ [go to] disneyland ? 
B|42| M: yes . 
A|43| B: [oh ,] okay . [so [,] but] [um ,] now _, i don't know_ [, but] [um [,] but] let's _see_ , when _i was_ eleven [i went] also [to the] caribbean . 
B|44| M: uh-huh . 
A|45| B: [and [, uh] ,] [then] after _that [,_ i _,] my_ sister lives [in] turkey , [so] when _i was_ [like] fourteen , fifteen [, i went] [, i went to] turkey . 
B|46| M: uh-huh . 
A|47| B: [and] _this_ christmas [, i went to] turkey . [but] basically , it's [a] , [for] [the] past [couple of years] [, i ,] since _my_ parents _are_ , _are_ _, well [,_ i'm] from argentina [, and] _my_ parents live down _there_ . [so ,] _all_ [the] traveling [i] [do] _is_ alone . 
B|48| M:  !!!!,!! [oh] !! 
A|49| B: [and [, uh] ,] _we were_ never much [of] [, uh ,] [a] very [, uh ,] family thing _, you know_ , made , [like] [go] skiing [in] vermont _or_ something . 
B|50| M: [um .] 
A|51| B: [that] _was_ [, uh _,] that_ _was_ [a lot of] fun . 
B|52| M: [oh _,] [yeah_ .] 
A|53| B: [but ,] _what happens_ _is_ [we] used [to] fight [a lot] , [so] there's never much _of a_ family family thing . _you know_ , one [of] those hell family vacations . 
B|54| M: [right .] 
A|55| B: [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [and [, and] , and] [we] _try _to_ go_ over [there] [and] [we] [go] over [to] grand canyon [and] [we] [do] [that] . 
A|57| B: [yeah .] 
B|58| M: [so] [we were] really [in] kind [of a] rough spot [, you] couldn't really _make_ [a] living _at_ _it_ . 
A|59| B: [well _,] my_ dad , _all_ he , _all_ he wanted [to] [do] _was_ get money [for] us , [so] he could _buy_ us material [things] . 
B|60| M: _yeah , [yeah_ .] 
A|61| B: [and , and] [to] me _, you know_ , it's _like ,_ now [i'm] twenty-two [, but] [i] still feel _, you know_ , it's [like] [yeah ,] [we] never threw [a] football _or_ something 
B|62| M: [right .] 
A|63| B: [and] [the] way _i was_ brought up [, and] he wants me now , he , [like] he _, you know_ , [like] he wants [to] _be_ best friends now 
B|64| M: [uh] . 
A|65| B: [and] it's very hard [for] me because _, you know_ , it's [like] [you] grow up [to] _be_ twenty [years] old [, and] it's _always_ [the] same man 
B|66| M: [uh _,] [yeah_ .] 
A|67| B: [and then] suddenly he sees [that] _he's_ getting old [, and] he wants [to] _be_ best friends 
B|68| M: [uh] . 
A|69| B: [but [, uh] _,] you know_ , it's _like [,_ i] can only express myself [so] much , because _, you know_ [, um ,] everything [that] he taught me _, you know_ _, that_ _my_ family taught me , which _is_ very hard [to] change [that] _all_ [of a] sudden from one year [to the] next [and] say [, i'm] sorry _, you know ._ it's _like _,_ you know_ [, i] love [you] [and] let's [go out] [and] [do] [things] together when _i don't_ feel [like] [it] _, you know_ 
B|70| M: _uh , that's_ true . 
A|71| B: [and] [so [,] that's] [that] whole thing [that] he'll say when , _like ,_ [like] _i've_ seen _my_ uncle [and] his family _, you know_ , does everything together [, and] _you know_ , his _kids_ _are_ _, you know_ , when his [little] girl _was_ five [years] old [and] everything [, they [, uh] [,] they] _would_ [go to the] beach [, and] she could [go to] sleep [at] two [in] [the] morning _you know_ 
B|72| M: [oh _,] [yeah_ .] 
A|73| B: [and [, uh] _, i] was_ brought up [the] same way , [it] doesn't matter _what_ age [you] [have ,] _just_ [so] long [as] [you] can get up [to [go] to] class [the] next morning [, you] can stay up _you know_ , 
B|74| M: [right .] 
A|75| B: [but] his , _what_ he does _is ,_ when he gets home , he separates his [work] from his house . 
B|76| M: [oh] . 
A|77| B: [yeah .] 
B|78| M: [he's] _got _to_ have a_ [place] [to] store [all] [that] stuff [, _and [,] you know_ .] 
A|79| B: [yeah .] 
B|80| M: _and , you_ [just] _have to_ trust their judgment . 
A|81| B: [yeah , [yeah] [,] but [, uh] ,] it's [just] , it's [just] something _that [,_ you know] _, my_ theory _is [,_ you know] , when , when [you] [have] _kids_ [and] [all] _you [,_ you] want [to] [do] _, well ,_ _what_ i'll [do] _is [,_ you know] , _like [,_ i] mean [, you] might [have] problems [, but] it's [not] _your_ kids' problems [you know] , 
B|82| M: uh-huh . 
A|83| B: [and] [you] [got to] [try to] _be_ with them [as] much [as] [you] can [and] [to [,] you know] , _like ,_ thing _is ,_ _is _, that_ [,_ you know] , [like] _if_ _, if_ [they] _would_ ever happen [to have a] drug problem , suppose _, that_ [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] saying [, i] [got] [a] problem [you know] , 
B|84| M: [right .] 
A|85| B: [and , uh and] _that would_ [make] _any_ parent feel good [and] bad [at] [the] same time [, you know] , 
B|86| M: [right .] 
A|87| B: first [of] [all] _you're_ coming [to] me [and] let's _see_ how [we] can get rid [of] [the] problem [, you know] [, and] [that's] [uh , that's] very [, that's] very hard [to] [do] , because [once] _you're_ best friends with _your_ parents , [then] [, i] think everything [go] [a lot] better . 
B|88| M: uh-hums [, uh [,] uh] . 
A|89| B: [yeah .] 
B|90| M: [and] [we were] [, you] [were] [just] sort [of] [like [,] well ,] we'll [just] wait [and] [see] [what happens] [, [you] _,] you're_ [not] going [to _have] any_ [kids] [in] _college_ . 
A|91| B: [yeah _,] my_ _, my_ father _was_ raising four [oh] [well ,] three [kids] before he _had_ me , [so] [it] _was_ [, uh [,] you know] [, you're] trying , [to] support [, uh ,] four [kids] [, and] it's pretty hard [you know] , 
B|92| M: [yeah] 
A|93| B: _and i , i_ told him , listen [you] could [have] _had_ [a lot of] money _if you_ _would_ [have] only _had_ two [kids] . 
B|94| M: [that's] [right .] 
A|95| B: he says [yeah [,] but] [then] [i] wouldn't [have] [you [,] i go] [, [yeah] [,] but] [then] [you] _would_ [have [a] lot of] money 
B|96| M: [yeah [,] that's] true . 
A|97| B: [yeah .] 
B|98| M: [and] [i'm] sure [that] [that's] [not] going [to] help either . 
A|99| B: [but [,] you know] , [like ,] four [, i] mean four children _is_ expensive , especially when [you] consider [like ,] especially [for] me , which [i'm] paying [out] [of] [state] tuition . [i'm] paying [, you know] , three thousand _, no ,_ [what] _is_ [it] , two thousand six hundred dollars [for] one semester . 
B|100| M: [oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|101| B: [and , you know] , people say [, you know] , it's expensive [to] think it's [college] [, but _,] if_ _, if_ everybody _would be a_ [little] bit responsible [, you know] , it's [like ,] [what] does [it] , [what] does [it] cost . [it] costs five hundred dollars [a] semester suppose . now [they [go] to] [a] [state] [college] [and they] live [at] home [you know] , 
B|102| M: [right .] 
A|103| B: [and] [well ,] [it] costs two hundred dollars [for] books [, but] [you know] , seven hundred dollars [a] semester , [a lot of] people can spare [that] _if_ [they] planned ahead [, you know] , [like] 
B|104| M: [uh] . 
A|105| B: [i] mean , it's [like _,] if you_ plan [a] year ahead [, you] can probably save up seven hundred dollars [you know] , one thousand four hundred dollars [to] send _your_ child [to] [college] [, you know .] 
B|106| M: [right .] 
A|107| B: [oh ,] [oh ,] excuse me ? 
B|108| M: what's [your] interest ? 
A|109| B: [well [, i] [,] i'm doing] computer science , computer engineering . 
B|110| M: [oh] .

B|112| M: [yeah .] 
A|113| B: because since [i'm] [an] international student [, they] want [to] send me back [to] argentina . 
B|114| M: [uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|115| B: [well [,] my] dad wants me [to go] back . [so .] 
B|116| M: [uh [, i] don't [know] [.] i [, i] [,] uh _,] i've_ [always] considered going [to] japan . 
A|117| B: _no ._ 
B|118| M: [no [,] no [,] [no] .] 
A|119| B: [no ,] because _if you_ [go] back [there] , [then] [you] can never get [out] . 
B|120| M: huh-uh . 
A|121| B: [like] [you] [don't] [have any] money [to ,] [to ,] get [out] . 
B|122| M: [yeah _, [and] i_ [, i] was] wondering [if you] [had] [, if you] [were] [to] [buy] [a] car [or] , 
A|123| B: [so [,] uh [,] [and [,] uh] [, i] was] thinking [, you know] , [like ,] [oh] [my] god [, you know] [, i go] back [there] [, [and] then] [, and i] get married [there] [, and] now [i] [have] [kids] [there] [, [and] then] i'll never leave [the] [place] [, you know .] 
B|124| M: [yeah .] 
A|125| B: [yeah [,] i] [know] [, and] [that's] [, that's] [what] happened [to] [my] brother . he came [to] school up here [, [and] then] when he [went] down [there] , he [was] [just] [so] bad off [, you know] from [not] being able [to] stay up here [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
B|126| M: uh-huh . 
A|127| B: [so .] 
B|128| M: [well [,] that [,] that] [is , [that] [would] be a] really tough , tough situation . 
A|129| B: [yeah [,] i've] [been] calling [a lot of] companies . [there] , some [of] them _are_ interested . [well ,] [at] least [for a] year [and] [a] half [i] can [work] , 
B|130| M: uh-hums . 
A|131| B: [so .] 
B|132| M: [i'm] [not] sure [, i'm] [not] too sure [what] [the] laws [are] pertaining [to] [this] . 
A|133| B: [all] [right] , same here . 
B|134| M: _bye-bye ._
