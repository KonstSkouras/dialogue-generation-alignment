B|23| M: [uh] . 
A|24| B: [and] this , eventually things [just] [went] [too] far 
B|25| M: [yeah , _that's] ,_ [that was] [my] mother [living] [with] me [, and] [i] [was] [just] , [you] know , [i] [was] [in] [a ,] [a] situation where [my] mother [was] [in] [an] [apartment] [and] [, uh ,] [you] [could] [see] her crying , 
A|26| B: [and] he allowed himself _to be_ put into [a nursing] _home_ . 
B|27| M: [yeah , _that's] ,_ [that] [would] [be] [a] nightmare . 
A|28| B: _right_

A|30| B: [well] [that's _,] [yeah_ , that's] _right_ [that] _the_ children _have_ some responsibility [, too] [, to] their parents [and] such [, to] help decide what's _the_ _right_ thing . 
B|31| M: [yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|32| B: [and] .
