B|1| M: [uh] . 
A|2| B: _right_ _we_ wound up _just_ choosing _a_ another mennonite _nursing_ _home_ _that was_ easier _to_ get into . or _but_ naturally no _it_ _was_ even mennonite related i'm sorry _it_ _was_ actually not _a_ particularly great _nursing_ _home_ . mostly _the_ thing _was_ _that_ _it_ _was_ available when _we_ needed _it_ _because_ he suddenly got sick _and_ needed _to be_ put _in_ . 
B|3| M: _uh-huh ._ oh _that's_ [that] sounds awful 
A|4| B: [uh] what _do_ _you_ _think_ ? 
B|5| M: [well] _i_ _i_ don't [think] [that] [uh] [nursing] homes are safe .

A|8| B: _yeah ._ 
B|9| M: _so_ she [had] [to] _make_ [that] decision on her _own_

A|12| B: _yeah that's_ _important_ _i would_ say . 
B|13| M: [yeah .] [yeah] [i] [i would] [i] really [think] _so_ [because] it's [important] for your [uh] your family [and] for your future _too_ . 
A|14| B: okay . 
B|15| M: [and] [uh] she [is] able [to] [to] [do] [that] [and] it's [very] convenient [because] [you] know she has [a] private baby-sitter [that] [you] can [just] trust her _with_ whatever she decides [you] she will [do] [it] 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [and] she [was] [very] [very] concerned about me 
A|18| B: _right_ [and] [that] becomes difficult then . 
B|19| M: [it] really [is] . 
A|20| B: [uh-huh .] yep [we] tried [to] convince _my_ grandfather [to] live [with] us at several points _during the_ last few years [of] his life [but] he [was] essentially [too] proud [and] [too] independent [so] [that] even though his heart [was] getting incredibly weak [and] his knees were going bad he lived [in] his [own] house as long as he _could_ 
B|21| M: [uh] . 
A|22| B: [but] he [was] _living_ alone [had] _an_ upstairs _apartment_ _could_ barely [make] [it] up _the_ steps [to] _the_ top without [a] great deal [of] pain 
B|23| M: [uh] . 
A|24| B: [and] this eventually things [just] [went] [too] far 
B|25| M: [yeah that's] [that was] [my] mother [living] [with] me [and] [i] [was] [just] [you] know [i] [was] [in] [a] [a] situation where [my] mother [was] [in] [an] [apartment] [and] [uh] [you] [could] [see] her crying 
A|26| B: [and] he allowed himself _to be_ put into [a nursing] _home_ . 
B|27| M: [yeah that's] [that] [would] [be] [a] nightmare . 
A|28| B: _right_ 
B|29| M: [and] she's she's gone through [a] period [of] depression [and] she's [had] [to] find [a] good [home] [and] [and] [uh] take care [of] herself [and] everything . 
A|30| B: [well] [that's] [yeah that's] _right_ [that] _the_ children _have_ some responsibility [too] [to] their parents [and] such [to] help decide what's _the_ _right_ thing . 
B|31| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|32| B: [and] .
