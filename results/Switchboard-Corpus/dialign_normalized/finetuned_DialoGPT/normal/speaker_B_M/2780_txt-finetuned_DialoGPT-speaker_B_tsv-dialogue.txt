B|49| M: [right] . [right] . 
A|50| B: [uh] [yeah] 
B|51| M: [and [i] [i] think] [i] _agree with_ _that ._ 
A|52| B: [but] here again [i] [go] back [to] [the] second amendment [you] can disagree by [freedom of speech] which has nothing _to do_ [with] action . 
B|53| M: [right] [right] . 
A|54| B: [now i] am [i] am adamantly _against_ [that .] 
B|55| M: uh-hum . 
A|56| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [and] [they] keep fighting each other [and [i] think] _that's_ [just] [what] [they] need [to do] [and [i] don't] [think] [it's] going [to] stop anytime soon . 
A|58| B: huh . 
B|59| M: [and] [that] [is] [what [is] [uh] [what] is] keeping [the] united states from [uh uh] having [a] revolution . 
A|60| B: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] 
B|61| M: [but [i] don't] [think] [you] [have [to] be] [a] complete lunatic _to to_ [uh] follow [the] scriptural principals . 
A|62| B: [no .] 
B|63| M: [and [i] think] [i think] [you're] [right] . 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [i mean] [i don't] [know] [what] i'd [do] [if] [it] _was_ someone [i] knew _was_ oppressing [me] . [but [i] mean] [it's] [just] [i think] [i] [would] [be] scared [to] death [of] [my] [own] family [you know] . 
A|66| B: [well] here again [we uh] even though [you] [uh] physically [you] [agree with] [me] _you you_ wouldn't [do] [it] yourself . 
B|67| M: [no .] not at _all_ . 
A|68| B: nevertheless [you] maintain _that _it's_ _it_ is_ [the right] _of of_ [any] citizen [to] burn [the] symbol [of] their [country .] 
B|69| M: uh-uh . _that's_ [right] . 
A|70| B: [uh] um _so_ [long] as [it's] their possession . ok [you're] [you're] [that's] fine [up] [to] there except [that [uh] what] [that] [flag] symbolizes [is [uh] uh] [is] this [country] 
B|71| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [and i] used [to] [know] as [a] boy scout [but] [all] [i] remember [was] [the] red [in [the] flag] represented [the] blood [that] [was] shed [to to] create this [country] [and] [to] maintain _it ._ 
B|73| M: oh [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [and] _to me_ [that's] [uh uh] black eye [to] every man [that] [ever] [uh] carried [a] weapon [or] killed [for] his [country .] 
B|75| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [but i] don t [mind] [if] they're going [to] get convicted [of] [uh [you] know] sexual offenses [and] stuff [like] [that] [and i] don [think] [that] [they] _should be_ allowed [to] [you] can't [you] could not sentence them [to] life without possibility [of] parole . 
A|78| B: [it's] [it's] very easy [to do] . 
B|79| M: [uh] [and [i] think] [that's] [one] [thing] [that's] good [about] [it is] [that [uh] [you] don't] [have [to] be] [so] uh-honed out [you know] 
A|80| B: [uh] [uh-huh .] 
B|81| M: [you know] [i mean] [i think] [that's] [one] [of] those things [that] [you know] [it's] sort [of like] supporting animal rights . [you know] [you] support animal rights [but] [you don't] [you] don tinker [with it] [or] [you] don [you you] sort [of] [you're] [against] [it .] 
A|82| B: [well [i] think] [it] [should be] permitted under [certain] 
B|83| M: uh-hue . 
A|84| B: [uh-huh .] huh _. well_ tell [me] has [it] [ever] [been] decided when when [is a] [uh] fetus [a] human ? 
B|85| M: [well i i] [know] [that] [i have] heard [uh uh] 
A|86| B: huh . 
B|87| M: [and [uh] [i] think] [i mean] [i] don t understand [the] idea [of the] father [or] [the] mother being [the one] who ultimately decides what's going [to] happen . 
A|88| B: [or] [they] [on] their within [the] [own] [uh] society [it] can vary . 
B|89| M: [yeah [.] [well] [it's] it] [it] seems [to me] [that uh] [that it's] [just] [it] [was] [a] convenient way [to] get [away] from having [to] [go] through [so] many generations [of of] [uh uh] [of] history before [you] could [really] say [well] [you know] [you] can't [have] [it] [any] [more] 
A|90| B: [uh-huh .]
