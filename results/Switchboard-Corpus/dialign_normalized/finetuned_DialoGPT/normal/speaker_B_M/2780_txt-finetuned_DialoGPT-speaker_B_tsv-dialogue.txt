A|66| B: [well] here again [we] [uh] even though [you] [uh] physically [you] [agree with] [me] [you] [you] wouldn't [do] [it] yourself . 
B|67| M: [no .] not at _all_ . 
A|68| B: nevertheless [you] maintain _that it's_ _it is_ [the right] [of] [of] [any] citizen [to] burn [the] symbol [of] their [country .] 
B|69| M: uh-uh . _that's_ [right] .

A|88| B: [or] [they] [on] their within [the] [own] [uh] society [, it] can vary . 
B|89| M: [yeah [.] [well] , it's] [, it] [, it] seems [to me] [that] [, uh ,] [that it's] [just] [, it] [was] [a] convenient way [to] get [away] from having [to] [go] through [so] many generations [of] [, of] [, [uh] [uh] [,] of] history before [you] could [really] say [, well [,] [you] know] [, you] can't [have] [it] [any] [more]
