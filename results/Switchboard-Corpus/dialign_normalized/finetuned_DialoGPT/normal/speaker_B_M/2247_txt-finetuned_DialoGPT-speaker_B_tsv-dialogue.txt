A|10| B: yes _, it_ is . _uh ,_ unfortunately _i_ need all _of_ _it ._ 
B|11| M: uh-huh . 
A|12| B: _uh ,_ for example _, i was_ messing around _with a_ spreadsheet this weekend _that's_ _a_ third _of_ _a_ meg in beta size . 
B|13| M: yeah . 
A|14| B: _and_ that _, _i_ know_ that _, _uh_ ,_ brings an eighty eighty-eight machine _to_ its knees because _i_ had taken _it_ over from _a_ friend _who_ _was_ working on _it_ _and_ he had _a_ two eighty-six machine ,

A|24| B: _uh ,_ what i've gotten into more recently _are_ _the_ tools _to_ use them . have _you_ , 
B|25| M: [uh] . 
A|26| B: _to_ try _to_ make them more effective _and_ useful . 
B|27| M: yeah _, [and_ [i] know] [a] lot [of] people [who] [are] _very_ , _very_ against [it .] 
A|28| B: have _you_ been _, _uh_ ,_ struggling along those lines ? 
B|29| M: _no_ [, i] haven't . 
A|30| B: well _, i think_ _you_ will be real pleased _to_ get away from _the_ banana as [i] used _to_ call [it .] _it's_ _, _uh_ [,_ i] used [it] on _, _uh_ ,_ some other machines in days gone by [and] _was_ real pleased _to_ leave [it .] _it was_ [a] real memory hog when _you_ started making large blot changes _to_ [it .]

B|39| M: yeah . 
A|40| B: yes _, [uh_ ,] maybe you'll play around some [and] figure _out_ how they can help _you_ do different things _. _i think_ that's_ when _you_ , _you_ start deciding that _you_ [really] need greater assets than _you_ already have . when _you_ start seeing what all they can do for _you ._ 
B|41| M: uh-huh . 
A|42| B: well [, i] understand that _you_ [know] . if , needs [and] wants were _the_ same i'd have [a] four eighty-six machine at home
