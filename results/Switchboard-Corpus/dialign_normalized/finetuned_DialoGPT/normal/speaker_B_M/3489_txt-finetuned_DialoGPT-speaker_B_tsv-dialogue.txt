A|0| B: _yeah_ _uh i_ was 
B|1| M: _well_ _you know_ [i] _i think_ _we're_ _going to_ _see_ _a_ lot more _recycling_ centers _and a_ lot _a_ lot _going_ _on_ here _in_ _this_ _area_ . 
A|2| B: _my_ community _that's_ cute _. i_ live [in] [a] place called _dye_ mound . 
B|3| M: oh okay . 
A|4| B: or _dye_ community . 
B|5| M: oh [dye] 
A|6| B: [and] _it's_ _not_ [a] city _not_ incorporated _my_ nearest neighbor's about [a] half [a] mile at least [i] can't even [see] their house [and] _uh_ 
B|7| M: [uh] 
A|8| B: _yeah_ _i mean_ [uh] _i'm_ out [in] _i'm_ out [in] _the_ wilderness . literally . 
B|9| M: oh [i] [see] . 
A|10| B: [and] [uh] [well] give [you] an idea _it's_ three [and a] half miles _of_ dirt road [to] _the_ concrete _i mean_ [to] _the_ asphalt [we're] out there . 
B|11| M: uh-huh . 
A|12| B: [and] [uh] we _i do_ some interesting [recycling] things . 
B|13| M: oh _really_ . 
A|14| B: _i'm_ building our house _right_ now [and] _i'm_ [going to] incorporate into _my_ [uh] garage [area] [a] weight activated [uh] crusher . 
B|15| M: oh great . 
A|16| B: so when [i] drive _the_ car [in] _the_ [in] _the_ driveway [in] _the_ afternoon _it_ _it_ will just drive _it_ up [on] [a] ramp _that_ actually puts me [on] top _of_ _the the uh_ pressure side _of_ [a] [uh] hydraulic cylinder . 
B|17| M: uh-huh . 
A|18| B: [and] _the_ weight _of_ _the_ car will crush what's ever [in] _the_ disposer . 
B|19| M: [right] . 
A|20| B: hopefully _it's_ _not_ _my_ wife . 
B|21| M: _yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _well i_ thought i'd [you know] i'd use _it_ as [a] an escapement type thing _. _i_ _don't_ know_ if you're familiar with _that_ operation _but_ _what_ [you] _do_ _is_ [you] just build up _the_ pressure 
B|23| M: uh-huh . 
A|24| B: [and] then [you] go over [and] release _it_ [and] then _it_ just _it_ just drops [you know] . 
B|25| M: [uh] _i've_ heard [of] [it] [but] [i] haven't done _it ._ 
A|26| B: very similar [yeah .] 
B|27| M: [yeah .] 
A|28| B: [well] _what_ _what_ [it] will be [you] just [you] drive up [on] _the_ jack [but] [you] [it] won't go down . 
B|29| M: oh okay [yeah] [that's] [what] [it's] _for_ . 
A|30| B: until [you] pull _the_ pin [yeah .] 
B|31| M: [yeah .] 
A|32| B: anyway _i have_ another [uh] [recycling] method [i] use . 
B|33| M: uh-huh . 
A|34| B: [you know] all _that_ _junk mail_ [you] get ? 
B|35| M: [well] [not] [junk mail] . [uh] [it's] [uh] 
A|36| B: _the_ glossy paper _that_ says buy [this] [and] send off [for] _that_ [and] [you] _have_ won [and] all _that_ . 
B|37| M: uh-huh . 
A|38| B: [well] anytime they send me [a] return envelope [i] put all _that_ stuff back [in] _the_ envelope plus _the_ other stuff _that_ _i you know_ happen [to] gather up . 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: because [uh] [well] like [i] say we live [a] way [and] when [you] throw _trash_ away [you] throw [it] [in] _my_ yard . 
B|41| M: [right] . 
A|42| B: [and] _i don't_ like _that_ 
B|43| M: no . 
A|44| B: so _i don't_ _do that_ . so [i] take [it] [and] [i] send [and] [i] [mail] [it] back [to] them . 
B|45| M: [yeah .] 
A|46| B: [i've] had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
B|47| M: oh [my] goodness . 
A|48| B: [yeah .] _well [i_ think] _one_ [of] _the the_ best ways [to] eliminate [uh] or help _the_ [recycling] problem _is_ [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
B|49| M: [yeah] [i've] [i] [i'm] [not] real sure [what] [the] steps are [to] [do that] [but] [i think] [we're] [going to] [have] [to] [do] something [. [i] you know] [i] don [i] _really_ [don't know] [what] [the] solution [is] . 
A|50| B: [for] instance _uh i_ saw [a] thing [on] [uh] nova [i think] [it] was [the] other day . 
B|51| M: uh-huh . 
A|52| B: [this] guy has designed recyclable materials _i mean_ recyclable items . 
B|53| M: oh [yeah .] 
A|54| B: whatever he makes [it's] all out [of] [the] same thing . 
B|55| M: [yeah .] 
A|56| B: [see] so plastic [it's] all out [of] plastic . 
B|57| M: [yeah .] 
A|58| B: if [it's] metal [it's] all out [of] metal . [it's] he's [a] design he's [a] engineer designing stuff . 
B|59| M: uh-huh . 
A|60| B: [and] [and] incorporating [you know] reusable materials into your [uh] [you know] your assembly line into your actual scheme [of] product operations [is] [is] [the] only way [to] [really] [do] [it] [on] [a] [on] [a] broad scale . 
B|61| M: uh-huh . 
A|62| B: make [it] financially [uh] attractive [to] recycle 
B|63| M: [right] . 
A|64| B: [and] somebody will find [a] way [to] make money at [it .] 
B|65| M: [yeah .] 
A|66| B: [and] 
B|67| M: [i] [i'm] [not] sure [that] [the the uh] . 
A|68| B: [well] there [is] [a] guy [in] dallas [that's] all he does . 
B|69| M: uh-huh . 
A|70| B: he collects _trash_ . [you know] [and] 
B|71| M: [well [i] have] [uh [i] have] [one] [i don't] [i mean] [i do] [have] two [trash] cans . 
A|72| B: [yeah] [well] he's he's out [for] cardboard . 
B|73| M: uh-huh .
