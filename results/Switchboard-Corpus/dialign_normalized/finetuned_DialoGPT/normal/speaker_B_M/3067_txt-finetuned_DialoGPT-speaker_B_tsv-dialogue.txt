B|30| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|31| B: [uh] father's . _my mother's_ father's _family_ had quite _a_ few [uh] brothers _and_ sisters .

B|38| M: oh [yeah .] 
A|39| B: _and_ _so_ [uh] _it's_ not quite as close as [it] used _to_ be . _so _i_ think_ people feel less _of_ _a_ desire _to_ _really_ go _. _i_ _know_ that_ 
B|40| M: [yeah .] 
A|41| B: _well _i_ i_ _just_ _think _that_ _uh_ you know_ at [that] when when they were _you know_ the those were all brothers _and_ sisters _a_ lot _and_ or they were all in the same geographical location . 
B|42| M: uh-hau [uh] . 
A|43| B: _you know_ back around _you know_ in the twenties _and_ thirties when they were growing up _uh you know_ they were all located together in one small community . 
B|44| M: _right ._ 
A|45| B: _and_ as as time grew _i mean_ when time went on the _family_ grew _and_ moved away _and_ _so_ forth . _and_ now when they come together _it's_ _it's_ generally _you know_ _like_ say the kids _of_ those people who are not _you know_ anywhere near one another _and i_ do not _think_ they feel the the closeness [that] they used _to_ be there . which [is] _a_ shame 
B|46| M: [uh] [uh] . 
A|47| B: _but_ [that's] _just_ _how_ _it is_ . _my_ mother [was] complaining last year about _you know_ _it's_ dwindling down every year _you know_ [that's] _just_ _i think_ [that's] _just_ 
B|48| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of that] 
A|49| B: _well_ [yeah .] [yeah] [that's] [uh] _yeah _i_ think_ [that's] some [of] [it] . _but_ _you know i_ _have_ [uh] _i i_ _it's_ _just_ the way _you know i think_ society [is] now [is] [that] we are not we do not _have_ the extensive _family_ we used _to_ . 
B|50| M: _uh well [i_ [know] [my] mother's] always worked [and [i] know] [how] important [it is] [to] [have a] _family ._ 
A|51| B: _it's_ more [of] [a] _you know_ [a] smaller smaller unit [and] _you know_ we we tend [to] try [to] do things _i think_ _with_ our immediate [family] as opposed [to] the extended [family .] [of] people [that] we may or may not remember or [know] _you know_ _very_ [well] . 
B|52| M: _right _._ right ._

B|54| M: _i mean i_ don't [know] [. i] don _i really_ don't [i mean] [it] [just] seems [like] [uh] 
A|55| B: [right] [it] requires [a] lot [of] effort [to] [to] [to] do [that] sort [of] thing . 
B|56| M: [yeah] [yeah [i] i] agree [with] [that] [. [i] think] [uh that [uh] _that] [i_ know] [uh [you know] i [think] that] [it's] [very] difficult [to uh] 
A|57| B: [i mean [i] i] used [to] enjoy going [i mean i] still do kind [of] enjoy [it] _but uh_ [it's] [it] does not [it's] not as many people there [that [i] really] [really] enjoy seeing . 
B|58| M: _uh-huh ._

B|64| M: oh okay . 
A|65| B: [uh you know] [and] [and] generally when [i] [was] growing up [a] lot [of] those people the only time [i] ever saw them [was] at the reunion _so_ [uh]
