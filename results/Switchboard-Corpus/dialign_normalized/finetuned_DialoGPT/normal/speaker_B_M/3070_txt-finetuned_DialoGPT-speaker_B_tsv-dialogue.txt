" 
B|78| M:  !!! % !! remind _me_ . _that's_ [a ,] _that's_ [a] [really] nice area . 
A|79| B: liked [to] kill [me] , because [i] _it was [,_ i] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation [, i] [did _,] it_ by myself . 
B|80| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! remind [me] . 
A|81| B: [and , uh ,] nobody brought covered dishes . _we had_ [a great big] fish fry [, [and] [,] you know , i] fixed [a] salad in [a] number three tub . 
B|82| M: [oh [,] that] sounds [great] . 
A|83| B: [and [,] [and] _, uh ,] it was_ an enormous task [to] bring all [of] those people together [with] [just] _one_ or two people helping . [and , uh ,] _we had_ [to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] all [of] them [and] [i] told him , 
B|84| M: [oh ,] [i'm] sorry [, i] missed [that] . [yeah [,] i don't know] _what_ [they] were , 
A|85| B: "we [did] [it] [that] year [, and then] [the] following summer , [we did] [not] [have] all [of [the] family] [there] . [we] sent invitations . [we] said , ""please let us [know] if you're coming . "" [it was] when [, uh ,] his mother , his step father _had_ died [the] year before , " 
B|86| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| B: [and] [it ,] his mother [was] alone [, [and] [so] they] came [to] support her [, and then] _one_ by _one ,_ his [you know ,] his sisters , he began [to] lose [family] members , 
B|88| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|89| B: [and] [it was] difficult [to] hold them together . [and then] , [of] course , he died two years ago [, [so] [,] you know [,] that] [family] has gone down [to] _one_ brother [and] _one_ sister now . 
B|90| M: [yeah] . 
A|91| B: [and _, uh ,] [it_ [,] i think] [that's] [what] happens when [they] [get] scattered [, the] [, the family] unit [, you know ,] falls , into disrepair . 
B|92| M: [right .] 
A|93| B: [uh-huh .]

B|98| M: [but] [the second] [one] [was [,] uh , it was] [a good] [one ,] [too] . 
A|99| B: [uh-huh .] well , see , [we] manage , those people [who are] at [that] core group manage [to] keep , keep [the] vigor alive . they'll send [out] news bulletins . two or three times [a] year you'll [get] [a] news hey , guess [who] got [, you know ,] elected [to] [the] legislature , or guess [who] our local sheriff ,
