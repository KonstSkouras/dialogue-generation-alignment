A|14| B: _no_ [i] [have] _not_ seen _it ._ _but it's_ [but] _it is it is_ real interesting 
B|15| M: _yeah ._ 
A|16| B: [uh i] also _reading_ [uh] _the_ [uh] _it's_ [a] an old _another_ old _book_ [that] [i] happen [to] [have] _. i_ am sort [of] rereading _it ._ _it's_ [uh] [a] _book_ [about] [uh] _the_ bermuda triangle _but it's_ [uh] _it's_ [about] _it's_ [a] real _good_ _book_ [that] [a] guy [uh] wrote [who] _was uh_ [a] research librarian _he_ wrote [uh] sort [of] debunking many [of] _the_ [uh] [uh] _the_ stories [about] _the_ [uh] bermuda triangle _. you know_ _he_ _he_ _was_ thinking many many [of] _the_ _the_ myths many [of] _the_ myths [of] _the_ triangle were [uh] actually could _be_ explained 
B|17| M: uh-huh . 
A|18| B: _and_ _you know [._ uh] _and_ _the_ reason _i was_ picked _it_ _back_ up _was_ _in_ light [of] _all_ _the_ [uh] [well] _when_ _they_ found _the_ [uh] _the_ airplanes _on_ _the_ _in_ _the_ atlantic thinking _they_ were flight nineteen . _and_ _i don't know if_ [you] _are_ familiar _with_ [that] at _all_ _but it's_ [uh] flight nineteen _was_ _one_ [of] _the_ [uh] _was_ [a] [a] collection [of] [a] flight [of] five navy adventures at _the_ end [of] world war _two_ .

A|20| B: [yeah] _they_ were . 
B|21| M: [and uh] . 
A|22| B: [and] _so_ [and] _in_ _the_ _book_ _you know_ _even_ _he_ wrote _this_ _book_ _back_ _in_ _the_ seventies [and] _even_ [and] _even_ _then_ _he_ _he_ had [a] very _good_ case [for] _the_ fact _they_ probably _just_ got lost [and] _they_ ditched _in_ _the_ water . [and uh] _because_ _he_ _he_ mentions _he_ _he_ goes through [and] brings out points from _the_ navy's findings [and] _so_ forth . [and uh] _it's_ probably _you know_ real close [to] _what_ _you know_ everyone _is_ thinking _now_ [that] _they_ _just_ got turned around [and] could _not_ find their way _back_ . 
B|23| M: [well] that's true .
