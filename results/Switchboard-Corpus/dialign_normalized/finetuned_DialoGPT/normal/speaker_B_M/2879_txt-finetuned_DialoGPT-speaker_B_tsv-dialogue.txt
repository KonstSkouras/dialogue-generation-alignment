A|62| B: [it's] more rural , 
B|63| M: [i'm] [in] , [i'm] [in] plano [, _so] ._ 
A|64| B: [uh [,] it] use [to be] use _to be [a_ , uh [,] uh ,] _have [a_ lot of] heavy industry , 
B|65| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| B: [but it's] kind [of] [, uh ,] [all] [the] industry has gone south , 
B|67| M: [right .] 
A|68| B: [and [, uh] ,] now [the] air force [is] [the] largest employer _in the [,_ uh ,] area [and [, uh] [,] uh [,] so] [it's ,] [not] too bad , 
B|69| M: _yeah ._ 
A|70| B: _it [,_ you _know ,] you_ still [have] [the [,] uh ,] more drug problems [and] typical [, uh ,] small city type problems , 
B|71| M: _yeah ._

A|78| B: [right .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's like [,_ you] [just] [don't] [, you] [don't] see [, you] can't see what [they're] doing . 
A|80| B: _i think , i think_ pennsylvania may [have] [just] reenacted [it] [because] [i'm] from [, uh ,] from pennsylvania [also] , [just] [, uh ,] [just] outside , [of] philadelphia , 
B|81| M: uh-uh . [oh ,] uh-h . 
A|82| B: [yeah .] 
B|83| M: [but [,] i] mean , i've been [there] _like [,_ i] [was] [in] , _like [,_ the] second grade [, [and] then] [i] _went_ [to] college , 
A|84| B: [right .] 
B|85| M: [and , uh] . 
A|86| B: [the] west part [of the] [state] [is] [and then] [the] east part [of the] [state] has [got] [all] [the] bleeding hearts [and] [all] [the] welfare cases [so .] 
B|87| M: [oh ,] [that's] [, that] [is] [a _,] that would [be_ a] [really] scary [thought] . 
A|88| B: [right .] 
B|89| M: [i , _i] guess_ [i [have] [a] hard] time [with _that] ._ 
A|90| B: [right .] 
B|91| M: [and] [it's] [not] [that] [we [have] [to] be a] little bit romanesque [about] [it ,] 
A|92| B: sure . 
B|93| M: [if] _they_ _had_ [a] chance [to] do something , _they_ [would] say [that] _they_ were [very] , [very] creative [and ,] 
A|94| B: [yeah ,] 
B|95| M: [but it's] [not] [like] [it's] going [to] _happen to_ everybody . 
A|96| B: [if] your friends [or] family [got] [, uh ,] [had] [that] [happen to] them [i think] everyone [would] [, i ,] they'd , probably pull [the] trigger themselves [or] flip [the] switch themselves [and] [with] [a] smile on their face , as [they] did [it .] 
B|97| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hue . [yeah .] [yeah _, yeah [,] [i_ think] , i think] _that would [be_ the] best _thing to_ do . 
A|98| B: [yeah [.] right .] 
B|99| M: [and , uh] [that] [was] [a] big factor [in] my decision . 
A|100| B: [right . right .] 
B|101| M: [but] [you] [would] want [to] [know , you] wouldn tinker [with] [it .] [i] mean [, i think] [that's] [the] whole point [of the] trial [by] jury . 
A|102| B: [well [,] uh [,] [i [,] uh] [,] yeah , i] [don't know] [i think] [the] old gas chamber [seems] [to be] [about] [the] most painless [because] [i guess] [it's a] pretty , pretty rough [thing [to] be] [, uh ,] electrocuted . 
B|103| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| B: [oh , yeah ,] an injection , 
B|105| M: [yeah .] 
A|106| B: [yeah [,] that would be] even [, yeah , i] didn't even , [think] [about] [that .] 
B|107| M: [yeah .] 
A|108| B: [i think ,] 
B|109| M: [but [i] think , i think] [in the [,] in] [, in] texas [they] _have [it_ .] 
A|110| B: [yeah ,] [there's] more [that] [don't] [have it] [but] amazingly [it's like [,] uh ,] massachusetts [went] back [, and] reinstated capital punishment , [oh ,] maybe six [or] seven [years] ago , 
B|111| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| B: [i] [don't know] [if] [they've] used [it] since [then] since [they've] reinstated [it] [but [, uh] [,] it's] on [the] books .
