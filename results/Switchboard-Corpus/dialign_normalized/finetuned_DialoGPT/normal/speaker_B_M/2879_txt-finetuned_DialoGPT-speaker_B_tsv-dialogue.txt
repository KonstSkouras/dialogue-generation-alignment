B|59| M:  !!!!!! iful !! my little boy [just] _got_ [in] kindergarten [and i] [was] [just] thinking [you know] [that's] [great] [that] [they're] starting kindergarten next [year] . 
A|60| B: [it's] _about_ [uh] [well] [i i] actually live [in a] village [of] sylvan beach [i] work [in] rome [uh] 
B|61| M: _oh yeah_ [uh-huh .] 
A|62| B: [it's] more rural 
B|63| M: [i'm] [in] [i'm] [in] plano _so ._ 
A|64| B: [uh] [it] use [to be] use _to be [a_ uh] [uh] _have [a_ lot of] heavy industry 
B|65| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| B: [but it's] kind [of] [uh] [all] [the] industry has gone south 
B|67| M: [right .] 
A|68| B: [and uh] now [the] air force [is] [the] largest employer [in the] [uh] area [and uh] [uh] [so] [it's not] too bad 
B|69| M: _yeah ._ 
A|70| B: [it] [you _know] you_ still [have] [the] [uh] more drug problems [and] typical [uh] small city type problems 
B|71| M: _yeah ._ 
A|72| B: _but i_ [don't know] [that there's a] real [uh] 
B|73| M: _yeah ._ 
A|74| B: [no] _there_ isn't [the] harsh crime [and] [all .] 
B|75| M: [oh] [i] [agree] . [uh] 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: _they_ _they_ go out [and kill] [the] person [you] can't do [that] 
A|78| B: [right .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's like_ [you] [just] [don't] [you] [don't] see [you] can't see what [they're] doing . 
A|80| B: _i think i think_ pennsylvania may [have] [just] reenacted [it] [because] [i'm] from [uh] from pennsylvania [also] [just] [uh] [just] outside [of] philadelphia 
B|81| M: uh-uh . [oh] uh-h . 
A|82| B: [yeah .] 
B|83| M: [but i] mean i've been [there] [like] [i] [was] [in] [like] [the] second grade [and then] [i] _went_ [to] college 
A|84| B: [right .] 
B|85| M: [and uh] . 
A|86| B: [the] west part [of the] [state] [is] [and then] [the] east part [of the] [state] has [got] [all] [the] bleeding hearts [and] [all] [the] welfare cases [so .] 
B|87| M: [oh] [that's] [that] [is] [a] _that would [be_ a] [really] scary [thought] . 
A|88| B: [right .] 
B|89| M: [i _i] guess_ [i [have] [a] hard] time [with _that] ._ 
A|90| B: [right .] 
B|91| M: [and] [it's not] [that] [we [have] [to] be a] little bit romanesque [about] [it] 
A|92| B: sure . 
B|93| M: [if] _they_ _had_ [a] chance [to] do something _they_ [would] say [that] _they_ were [very] [very] creative [and] 
A|94| B: [yeah] 
B|95| M: [but [it's] not] [like] [it's] going [to] _happen to_ everybody . 
A|96| B: [if] your friends [or] family [got] [uh] [had] [that] [happen to] them [i think] everyone [would] [i] they'd probably pull [the] trigger themselves [or] flip [the] switch themselves [and] [with] [a] smile on their face as [they] did [it .] 
B|97| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hue . [yeah .] [yeah [yeah] [i] think i think] _that would [be_ the] best _thing to_ do . 
A|98| B: [yeah [.] right .] 
B|99| M: [and uh] [that] [was] [a] big factor [in] my decision . 
A|100| B: [right . right .] 
B|101| M: [but] [you] [would] want [to] [know you] wouldn tinker [with] [it .] [i] mean [i think] [that's] [the] whole point [of the] trial [by] jury . 
A|102| B: [well] [uh] [i uh] [yeah i] [don't know] [i think] [the] old gas chamber [seems] [to be] [about] [the] most painless [because] [i guess] [it's a] pretty pretty rough [thing [to] be] [uh] electrocuted . 
B|103| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| B: [oh yeah] an injection 
B|105| M: [yeah .] 
A|106| B: [yeah] [that would be] even [yeah i] didn't even [think] [about] [that .] 
B|107| M: [yeah .] 
A|108| B: [i think] 
B|109| M: [but [i] think i think] [in the] [in] [in] texas [they] _have [it_ .] 
A|110| B: [yeah] [there's] more [that] [don't] [have it] [but] amazingly [it's like] [uh] massachusetts [went] back [and] reinstated capital punishment [oh] maybe six [or] seven [years] ago 
B|111| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| B: [i] [don't know] [if] [they've] used [it] since [then] since [they've] reinstated [it] [but uh] [it's] on [the] books . 
B|113| M: [oh] [really] .
