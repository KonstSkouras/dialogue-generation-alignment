B|2| M: oh [, [yeah] _,] i_ agree . 
A|3| B: _i think_ maybe _a_ year [would _be] ,_ _the_ longest . 
B|4| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|5| B: [yeah _,] and_ there will [be] _a lot_ _of_ rebellion _in_ _that and_ when _you_ get _people_ who _have_ no desire _to be_ there _in the_ first place _, i don't_ _think that_ _they're_ going _to be_ serving anybody . 
B|6| M: _right ._ 
A|7| B: _yeah ._ _so_ _i think_ _it_ [would be] _a_ [good] thing though , _to encourage_ other _people_ who aren't even aware _that _they_ can_ _do_ such _a_ thing . _to_ get out there _and_ _do_ _so_ . 
B|8| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|9| B: _yeah ._ [right .] 
B|10| M: _but i think_ there's _, _you_ , _you_ _have_ to_ [have] _some_ sort , _of a_ commitment _to do that ._ 
A|11| B: [right .] college credit is [a] [good] idea _because_ , 
B|12| M: [i] mean , _i'm not_ [, _i don't] know_ . 
A|13| B: [right .] 
B|14| M: _but ,_ 
A|15| B: [that's] [right] [yeah _,] they_ probably couldn't _do anything_ monetary _, [but i_ think] , giving , giving [some] _kind of_ college credit , 
B|16| M: [yeah .] 
A|17| B: no [, i don't] [think] _so_ either _because_ _a lot_ [of] _people_ , um , depending _on_ how _the_ public service programs are set up _and_ [i'm not] [that] familiar _with_ _them to_ _know ,_ 
B|18| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|19| B: [but _,] you know _,_ if _,_ _a_ , _a_ lot_ [of] _people_ flat _can't_ afford [to] . 
B|20| M: [right .] 
A|21| B: _you know ,_ 
B|22| M: well _, that's true_ . 
A|23| B: _and_ most kids _these_ days [have] gotten themselves _into_ _, uh ,_ financial situations , _where they_ [have _to] be_ working all _the_ time . 
B|24| M: [yeah .] 
A|25| B: _so_ , _it's_ , _it's a_ _really_ _tough question_ _. that's_ [right .] 
B|26| M: [it's _a] tough question_ _, and [i_ think] [it's] [really] important _that we_ [do] , _we_ try [to encourage] [them _to] go_ [into] [a] _better_ world [where [they] can] _have a_ happy life , 
A|27| B: [yeah ,] 
B|28| M: [i] mean _, i think_ [it's] [really] important [that _they] do_ [, uh] . 
A|29| B: _and _,_ if you_ put [them] _in_ public service [right] out [of] high school , _then_ [that , that] postpones their college , for [a] year 
B|30| M: [yeah .] 
A|31| B: [and] [that would] upset _a lot_ [of] _people_ _too _,_ because_ [they] _just_ _want to_ get _on_ , 
B|32| M: uh-hue . 
A|33| B: [yeah _.] _i_ _,_ you _know ,_ i think_ _it_ [would be good] for _a lot_ [of] _people_ [to] get involved _in_ [that] _kind of_ program , 
B|34| M: [yeah , yeah .] 
A|35| B: [but _i] , i think_ _it_ _can't_ [be] something [that's] mandatory . 
B|36| M: [right .] 
A|37| B: _it_ _has_ _to be_ something [that's] voluntary . _you know ,_ which is pretty much _the way_ _it_ is now . [they] might , 
B|38| M: [yeah [,] i] [know] [. i think] [that's] _, _that's_ [the_ way] [they're] thinking [. i] mean [, you] [can't] [, you] [don't] [have _to] do anything ._ 
A|39| B: [yeah [,] and] [that's the] other thing is _that _, you_ know ,_ instead [of] making _it_ mandatory _, they_ maybe _need to_ publicize _it_ _a little_ bit [better] . _and _,_ uh _, you_ know ,_ [go] [to] [the] schools [and] [do] programs [, and] tell [them] [that we] _need_ _your_ help [, _and] _, you_ know _,_ uh ,_ volunteer for such [and] such [a] time , 
B|40| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|41| B: [and] you've [a] choice [of] [where] _you want [to_ go] . 
B|42| M: [right .] 
A|43| B: _and , and_ [that] [way] , handling _it_ [that] [way] [they] _could_ probably get [some] results out [of] _it_ . 
B|44| M: [right .] 
A|45| B: [yeah ,] _in_ their own community , [right .] [yeah [,] that's true] most [of] [them] probably wouldn't [do] something _like_ [that .] although there are _a lot_ [of] kids who [would] [do] _it_ _just_ [to] get away _from_ their parents 
B|46| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|47| B: [but _,] they_ [would] [have _to] be_ supported _in_ [some] [way] [, and] [i'm not] sure [that] those programs are available [to do that .] 
B|48| M: [i] [know [, _i] don't] [know_ ,] you're _right [,_ [i] , i think] [they] should _have [a_ , [a] little] _more_ [, uh ,] information [on] [that and] [then] [we] [could] start talking about _it ,_

B|54| M: well [, i think] [it's] [just] [a] matter [of] [, _you] [have_ to] decide what [you want [to] [do] .] [if [you] want] [, [you] want] [your] child [to be] taken care [of] while you're at work . [if [,] if [,] if [you] want] her [to [be] [,] _you] , you_ [can] leave her at home . 
A|55| B: [yeah .] [yeah [.] i think] going [to] [the] schools [would be] [the] easiest for [them] . 
B|56| M:  !!! % !! remind me [that .] 
A|57| B: _you know ,_ [it] [be ,] [it] wouldn't take up much , much , [it] [would] take up [more] time than [anything] [but] [it] wouldn't take up _a lot_ [of] money . 
B|58| M: oh [, that's true] [. [that's] true] [, [that] [would] be] [true] . 
A|59| B: [they] wouldn't [have to] spend money advertising [and] _things like_ [that .] 
B|60| M: [right .] 
A|61| B: [you] [go] [to] school [and] [you [have] a] _kind of a_ captive audience , get [them] all _in the_ auditorium , 
B|62| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|63| B: [and] [you , you] give [them] [your] speech [and] maybe [a little] slide show or something , 
B|64| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|65| B: _and [,_ i think] [, [that] they] [could] get [some] results _from_ [that _,] because_ there are _a lot_ [of] _people_ who are volunteer [and] community minded , 
B|66| M: [right .] 
A|67| B: [but] [they] [don't know] [where] [to go] _to ,_ _to ,_ [to do anything .]

A|69| B: [yeah ,] [it] is . [it] [really] is . 
B|70| M: [and [, and] i don't] [, i] don [, i] mean [, [i] ,] [i'm] [, i] guess [i'm] [kind of] an arlingtonite , [too [,] you know [,] because] [i'm] originally [from] plano [, and] [so] i've lived _here_ forever , 
A|71| B: [right .] 
B|72| M: [and ,] you're [right [,] they] , [they're] [really] trying [to] start [people] off [on] [a] different level . 
A|73| B: [yeah , yeah .] 
B|74| M: [and [i] think [that] , you] see , you're beginning [to] see [more] [and] [more] [of] [that] [on] young [people] . 
A|75| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|76| M: [but [,] [i] [, [i] don't] [know] , i think] [it's] [kind of a] sad situation [. i] don [, i] [really] [do [.] i think [that] [,] uh , [you] , you] [need to] look at what [, uh] what [the] , what [the] united states [has] done [in the] past [with] regards [to [,] you] [do] see about [these] [things] ? 
A|77| B: [i don't] either [that's] one , 
B|78| M: [i] mean [, you] hear [a lot] about [, uh ,] funding [things like] aids research [and , [you] , you] [think] [that's] [, that's] funded , you're [right [,] but i] don t understand [, uh] . 
A|79| B: [yeah ,] [it] is [a tough question] . 
B|80| M: [but [,] uh [,] i think] [that's the] best answer .
