B|11| M: [yeah] 
A|12| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah] . _that's_ true . 
B|13| M: _you know i_ don't [know] it's just [a] _it_ seems [like] _it _it_ would [be_ more] [of] [a] challenge .

B|23| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|24| B: so [i] guess [the] problem _is_ [the] [the] thing [to do] _is_ [to try] [to] _uh_ [to] get some kind [of] motivation [to] learn [and] 
B|25| M: [yeah] [yeah] [i] [i've] _i have a lot of_ friends _that are_ teachers .

B|31| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|32| B: if [you] compare [the] [like] [the] [people] [that] [could] [have] [that] [could] [have] sent their kids [to] private schools [and] [the] [people] [that] [you know] [the] [people] _that uh_ did send their kids [to] private schools . 
B|33| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: [i think] [they] compare [you know] fairly _well_ . 
B|35| M: [well] [that's] [good] . 
A|36| B: [yeah] [. [i] [i] i] my schools [i mean] [there] [i have a lot of] once once [it] seemed [i] got into high [school] [they] had [a lot of] [uh] accelerated programs [and] all kinds [of] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [that] [i mean] [that] makes [a] big difference cause [i] wondered when they're taking classes with [uh] with [people] [that are] _really_ [are] interested in [the] [the] subject [and] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|39| M: [uh-huh .]
