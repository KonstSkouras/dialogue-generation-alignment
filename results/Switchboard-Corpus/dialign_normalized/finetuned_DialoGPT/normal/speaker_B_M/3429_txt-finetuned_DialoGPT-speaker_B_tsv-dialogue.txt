B|35| M: [right .] 
A|36| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| M: [but ,] uh _, it's_ hard [to] [know] _what_ we're doing _because_ _i don't know_ [what's] [going to] happen . 
A|38| B: no _, i don't_ [, i think that's] stupidity on parents' part . _i mean_ [that's ,] sex is rampant , 
B|39| M: [yeah] . 
A|40| B: [and] it always will _be_ [, and] [and _i think] ,_ _too_ , noticing the kids , [that] the fourth [and] fifth graders , which is [what] my son is [and] stuff , _they_ , they're just , they're _more_ , they're very open . 
B|41| M: uh-uh . uh-hue .

B|55| M: uh _, i do too ._ 
A|56| B: [yeah [, i] do too .]
