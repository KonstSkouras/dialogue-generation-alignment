B|19| M: uh-huh . 
A|20| B: the kids , _they_ are _real_ people _and_ _they_ are interesting _and ,_ _they_ , _they have_ all their own activities _and ,_ [um [,] i think] as parents [we] _really_ enjoy _them_ _in_ , _in_ our personal situation our [children] [have] not yet decided _to_ rebel 
B|21| M: _uh_ .

B|39| M: [well ,] yeah , yeah . [that's] _true_ . 
A|40| B: [well [,] i] [do] [think] _with_ working parents _it_ is [, _i] mean ,_ there are _some_ _real_ issues here [. um ,] [that] [i think ,] [um ,] 
B|41| M: [i don't] [think] [they have] enough control .

B|43| M: [oh] , uh-hau . 
A|44| B: [my] husband is _a_ physician , [so] _, uh , _i_ , i_ [i] talk _to_ parents _about_ this _a_ lot . but [children] [, _i] [, i_ think] working mothers or mothers who choose _to work_ outside the home , [um ,] need very early _to_ come _to_ grips _with_ [any] guilt , [that] [they] feel _and_ decide what's best for _them_ _and_ their family . 
B|45| M: [uh] . uh-hum . [uh] . 
A|46| B: _and i_ feel when [my] [children] were very young [, i] [had] jobs [that] helped [me] be flexible _with_ [my] schedule _and_ spend time _with_ _them_ _and_ all [that] sort [of] thing . _and i_ long ago decided [i'm] _a_ better mother because [i] _work_ outside the home . 
B|47| M: uh-hauhuh , uh-hue . 
A|48| B: [i] _really_ believe _that ._ _and it_ has , [um ,] helped us _to_ afford _some_ things for our [children] [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [i think] are wonderful particularly at this age _, _and_ [i_ think] our kids are _real_ secure . _and_ [have] _a real_ sense [of] priorities _and_ [that] [they] can [do] anything _and_ be anything both male _and_ female _a_ lot 
B|49| M: _uh , i would_ [, i] agree [with] [that .] 
A|50| B: [so] [i know] _it_ sounds like _a_ rationalization but [it's] [, i] _really_ [think it's] [true] for our family _, _and_ [i_ think] _it_ has worked very [well] . 
B|51| M: yeah . 
A|52| B: there's [no] question _, i think that's_ _really_ the best . if , if _a_ woman is happy doing [that] , 
B|53| M: yeah , yeah . 
A|54| B: [i] hate _to put it_ quite [that] _way_ . 
B|55| M: [uh [,] [and] [,] and] [that's] _, you_ can't blame [them] [. [i] mean ,] i've seen [some] [really] , [really] marvelous [, uh ,] creative use [of] _it [._ [you] know _,] you_ [could] [put] [a] bedspread [on] [a] wall [and it] wouldn't [take] more than [a] few minutes [to do] _it ._ 
A|56| B: _i was_ twenty-nine when [i] [had] [my] first child _and _, [uh_ , i_ would] not _have been_ _real_ fulfilled [. i] [really] [would] not _have been_ totally staying home [with] [a] young child . 
B|57| M: [uh ,] [that's] [right] . 
A|58| B: [it's] [a] wonderful , [it's] wonderful [to] be [a] mother but _, uh , i_ like [i] like the _way_ [i] did [it .] 
B|59| M: [well ,] [that's] great . 
A|60| B: [i] sort [of] worked half time [. i] [had] very flexible hours [. i] nursed all three [of] our [children] until [they] were at least [a] year _and i [,_ you] can [do] [that] despite working very easily which is one [of] the things [i] preach all the time [to] , [to] mothers . 
B|61| M: yeah . 
A|62| B: [um [,] _and] [i_ think] [we] choose very , very carefully the , [um ,] alternative situations [that] [we] [had] [them] _in_ . 
B|63| M: uh-hue . 
A|64| B: [some] baby-sitting groups , again [, [i] know] [it] sounds like [a] rationalization , but [i] [really] [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early [on] are around lots [of] other [children] [and] [they] , [they] learn [to] share . [they] learn not necessarily [to] be the center [of] attention but [that] at the same time [we] [have] [to] be [sure] [they] are secure . 
B|65| M: [right] . 
A|66| B: [i think] [that] helps . 
B|67| M: yeah [, i think that's] , [that's] [a real] good [way] [to put [it] .] 
A|68| B: [well ,] [so] , [so .] [so] , your wife , does _she_ _work_ [right] now ? 
B|69| M: [uh ,] [no] , [she] works .
