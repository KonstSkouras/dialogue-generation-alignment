B|43| M: [oh] uh-hau . 
A|44| B: [my] husband is _a_ physician [so] _uh _i_ _i_ i_ talk _to_ parents _about_ this _a_ lot . but [children] _i [i_ think] working mothers or mothers who choose _to work_ outside the home [um] need very early _to_ come _to_ grips _with_ [any] guilt [that] [they] feel _and_ decide what's best for _them_ _and_ their family . 
B|45| M: [uh] . uh-hum . [uh] .

B|49| M: _uh i would_ [i] agree [with] [that .] 
A|50| B: [so] [i know] _it_ sounds like _a_ rationalization but [it's] [i] _really_ [think it's] [true] for our family _and [i_ think] _it_ has worked very [well] . 
B|51| M: yeah . 
A|52| B: there's [no] question _i think that's_ _really_ the best . if if _a_ woman is happy doing [that] 
B|53| M: yeah yeah . 
A|54| B: [i] hate _to put it_ quite [that] _way_ . 
B|55| M: [uh] [and] [and] [that's] [you] can't blame [them] [. [i] mean] i've seen [some] [really] [really] marvelous [uh] creative use [of] _it [._ [you] know] [you] [could] [put] [a] bedspread [on] [a] wall [and it] wouldn't [take] more than [a] few minutes [to do] _it ._

B|61| M: yeah . 
A|62| B: [um] _and [i_ think] [we] choose very very carefully the [um] alternative situations [that] [we] [had] [them] _in_ . 
B|63| M: uh-hue . 
A|64| B: [some] baby-sitting groups again [i know] [it] sounds like [a] rationalization but [i] [really] [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early [on] are around lots [of] other [children] [and] [they] [they] learn [to] share . [they] learn not necessarily [to] be the center [of] attention but [that] at the same time [we] [have] [to] be [sure] [they] are secure . 
B|65| M: [right] . 
A|66| B: [i think] [that] helps . 
B|67| M: yeah [i think that's] [that's] [a real] good [way] [to put [it] .]
