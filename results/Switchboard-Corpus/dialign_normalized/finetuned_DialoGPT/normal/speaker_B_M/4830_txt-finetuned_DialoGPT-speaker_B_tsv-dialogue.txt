A|32| B: [right .] 
B|33| M: [and] [and] [i] _think_ it's [i] don't _know_ it's [a] little hard _to_ believe [that _that] _you_ know_ [a] lot [a] majority _of the_ _people_ don't realize _just_ how many how many horrible things [that] _have_ _to_ [be] done _to_ keep _the_ prisons full . 
A|34| B: _we_ _do_

B|47| M: [oh] . 
A|48| B: well [uh] [the] [the] [only] [i] [can] [i] [you know] [the] appeal procedure [is] [the] [only] [thing] [i] [can] possibly [think] [of] . [uh] _like_ [i] said as far as removing [of the] [jury] [and] having [the] judge sentence [that's] absurd . [there's] [no] [way] [that] _could_ work . 
B|49| M: [right .] 
A|50| B: [uh] [but] 
B|51| M: _i i_ [think] [i mean] [i'm] not [for] [sure] _that [you_ know]

B|59| M: [right .] 
A|60| B: [oh yeah [.] [i] i] feel [that] everyone [is] everyone [is] [uh] entitled [to a trial] [by] [jury] . [that [that] that] [right] 
B|61| M:  !!! et !! 
A|62| B: well [i mean] were [there] _witnesses_ ? 
B|63| M: [yeah] [there was] [witnesses] _that you_ _you could_ say ? 
A|64| B: [right .] [right .] [that you] [can't] [you] [can't] remove [the] [jury] regardless [of the] case . 
B|65| M: [uh-huh] . 
A|66| B: [i mean] [you could] [have] fifty [people] _in_ audience watching [a] murder take place 
B|67| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [and] [you] you'd [still] [there's] [still] mitigating _circumstances_ 
B|69| M: [yeah] [and] [and that's] [and] [i] [think] [that [you] know] [there] [should] [be] some [way] [of] [uh] [you] [uh] [you] [can] [be] selective [about] [jury] too because [there] are [circumstances] [you] [have] [to] [be] selective [in] [jury selection] too .
