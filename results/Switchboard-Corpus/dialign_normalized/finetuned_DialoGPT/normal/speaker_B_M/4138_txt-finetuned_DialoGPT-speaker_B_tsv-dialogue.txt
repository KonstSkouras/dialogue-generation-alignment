B|1| M: uh-huh . 
A|2| B: but _uh_ then again _uh_ _it's_ _the_ hard to justify with all _the_ wastefulness of money _that_ _the_ government spends on all levels of of _uh_ government including municipalities as _well_ as _state_ _and_ federal governments . 
B|3| M: [well] that's true . 
A|4| B: _uh_ _you're_ very fortunate . 
B|5| M: _and uh_ 
A|6| B: _we just_ try not to _pay_ any _more_ in than _we have_ to _uh we_ _pay_ in _a_ substantial amount . [uh] 
B|7| M: [well] [we just] _we have a_ [a] [uh [we] just] [pay] [the] [state] _tax_ which _is_ [uh] 
A|8| B: [we] don't regret paying taxes . [we] do _think that_ [uh] sometimes [uh [we] have a] reverse of [a] regressive [tax] [a] progressive [tax] . 
B|9| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|10| B: [and] progressive [tax] _i think_ [uh] does not give _people_ incentive to _make_ _more_ money [and] what _i_ mean by _that_ [the] _more_ _income_ _you_ _make_ [the] _more_ [tax] _you_ [pay] . 
B|11| M: right . 
A|12| B: it should be _i think_ [a] flat percentage [and uh] _that_ percentage ought to be an equitable amount . 
B|13| M: _yeah_ [i] agree . 
A|14| B: [uh] last year when _they_ passed [the] [tax] laws for [the] [uh] nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one [uh] [i] added up all [the] taxes _that_ [we] were going to [pay] on all these different specific luxury items [and] travel expenses [and] everything else 
B|15| M: _yeah_ . 
A|16| B: [and] [i] totaled them all up [and] basically [uh we] were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent [tax] . 
B|17| M: huh . 
A|18| B: now _that_ was [the] assumption _that_ _you_ spent _that_ same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's [uh] taxes on different things . 
B|19| M: [uh] that's true . 
A|20| B: but _you know_ there's there's [a] lot of taxes _you_ [pay] _that_ _you're_ not even aware of _that_ _you're_ paying [uh] like when _you_ buy [a] tire _you_ [pay] [a] federal excise [tax] . 
B|21| M: oh [i] see . 
A|22| B: _you_ [pay] gasoline taxes every time _you_ pump something into your your tank . 
B|23| M: _yeah_ . 
A|24| B: but _you_ _probably_ [pay] _more_ percentage wise in other taxes . 
B|25| M: _yeah_ that's true . [i think] [i think] [it's] [probably] [more] obvious [that] [people] [have] [have a] [have] [uh] [a] lower [income] . 
A|26| B: [yeah] if _you_ implemented [a] flat percentage it would encourage [people] [uh] to _make_ [more] money [and] [the] what [people] need to understand in my opinion now this [is] [just] my opinion okay [uh] [is] [that] businesses create jobs [and] jobs create [income] [and] [income] pays taxes . 
B|27| M: right . 
A|28| B: [and] so if _they_ penalize businesses business [people] _are_ smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder _and make_ any [more] or create any [more] jobs . 
B|29| M: right . 
A|30| B: [and] so based on [that] who do _you_ [think] _you're_ talking to _you're_ talking to an employer . 
B|31| M: [i think] that's true . [i [think] that] [i think] [it's] important [that] [they] check [you] out [and make] sure [you're] [you] [are] [you know]
