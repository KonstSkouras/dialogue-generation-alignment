B|27| M: [yeah] [well] _they_ do uh-havings [for] [uh] [you know] [for] _different_ companies [and] [i think] _that's_ [what] [i'd] [really] [like to] [have] . 
A|28| B: yes . 
B|29| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|30| B: [the] [yeah] [they] their [they] [have] [the] whole philosophy _i mean_ [they] [they] kind [of] even brainwash themselves into thinking _they're_ better which [is] kind [of] hard [to] take 
B|31| M: _yeah ._ 
A|32| B: _i mean_ as you're walking through [that] little tour in [uh] munich [it's] kind [of] _they're_ trying [to] brainwash [you] too 
B|33| M: [yeah] _yeah ._ 
A|34| B: [oh] [really] ?
