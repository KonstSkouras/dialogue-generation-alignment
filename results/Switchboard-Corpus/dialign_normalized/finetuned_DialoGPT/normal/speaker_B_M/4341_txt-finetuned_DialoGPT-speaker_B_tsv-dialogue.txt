A|2| B: or 
B|3| M: yeah [i] don [i mean i] don t even _know_ _what_ _the_ guy's name _is_ . 
A|4| B: well for _some_ things . 
B|5| M: yeah . 
A|6| B: _i think_ for serial murder _it_ [is] warranted because _if_ _a_ person who _would_ do something like _that_ _in_ cold blood 
B|7| M: right right . 
A|8| B: [i mean] _you_ can't guarantee _that_ _they_ wouldn't escape from prison and do _it_ again . 
B|9| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind me [of] [that] . 
A|10| B: and [i] don't _think _that_ that_ rehabilitation [is] effective . 
B|11| M: _no_ . 
A|12| B: but then _you know_ _i think _that_ that_ _some_ murderers don't really warrant capital punishment _. _you_ know_ just like for example _uh you know_ _you_ hear _about_ cases where women _have_ killed their husbands who abused _them_ 
B|13| M: uh-hue . 
A|14| B: and [i] don't _think that_ _would_ really warrant capital punishment . 
B|15| M: [uh] [i mean i] [i] [would] _think that if_ [they] had [if] [they] [you] had _a lot of_ violent crimes [uh you know] you'd you'd want _to_ look at [that] [you] see how many [uh] [of] [them] _are_ still doing violent crimes . 
A|16| B: [uh] _it_ [is] [to] [a] certain extent 
B|17| M: [uh] 
A|18| B: but _i think i_ don't [know] because 
B|19| M: right . 
A|20| B: _i think_ _in_ and _it_ just [would] depend upon [the] circumstances and and [the] extent [of] [the] abuse and and [if] another alternative was available . 
B|21| M: [uh] uh-hue 
A|22| B: well _i think that_ _would be_ kind [of] drastic punishment . 
B|23| M: yeah [i] agree . [i think] so . [i] [uh] . 
A|24| B: and 
B|25| M: [i] [i] agree with [you] . [i think [i] mean i'm] i've seen [some] _people_ get [uh] . 
A|26| B: but one thing _i [think that_ if] there [is] [a] chance for rehabilitation then [that] chance should _be_ investigated . 
B|27| M: uh-huh . 
A|28| B: but like [i] said [if] [if] someone [is] [is] just pathologically going [to] murder [people] [no] matter [what] then [i think] [they] should _be_ eliminated from society . 
B|29| M: right . 
A|30| B: but 
B|31| M: [i think that] [uh you know] [that that] [you] you're [you] [have] [to] [think] [about] [it] more than once though [. you] [have] [to] wonder [if] [they] [would be] willing [to] pay [a] little more [to] keep somebody else [in] line . 
A|32| B: and [a lot of] [people] [that] [are] [a] danger [to] society [that] aren't [in] prison . 
B|33| M: right . 
A|34| B: well [i] [know] [in] north carolina we do [have] capital punishment . 
B|35| M: huh-uh .
