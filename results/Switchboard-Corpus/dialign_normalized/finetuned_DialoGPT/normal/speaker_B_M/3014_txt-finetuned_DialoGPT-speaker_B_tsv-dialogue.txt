B|7| M: _yeah ._ 
A|8| B: [and] _we_ [bought it] for _very_ functional purposes 
B|9| M: _yeah ._ 
A|10| B: [and] _that_ _was_ _we_ [bought] _a_ station wagon . _we_ wanted an economical _car_ _to_ operate 
B|11| M: right .

B|39| M: _that's_ right . 
A|40| B: _so_ 
B|41| M: [well] _that's_ [a] pretty [good] deal . 
A|42| B: [and] [that] _was_ just trying [to] hold us getting out _of_ [that] _was_ _a used car ._

A|44| B: [and] [it] _was_ an older _car_ 
B|45| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|46| B: _but _you_ know_ escort [is] supposed _to [have_ a] great track record as far as sales . 
B|47| M: _yeah ._

[and] [that] [and] _i'd_ rather [have a] maxima than [a] cadillac _. i_ _really_ [would .] it's _not_ necessarily prestige 
B|61| M: _yeah ._ 
A|62| B: _but_ it's comfort . [uh] there's _a lot of_ features on there [that] are desirable _if_ you're _going to_ pay [that] kind _of_ money for [a] _car ._ [uh] 
B|63| M: [well] _that's_ true [. [i] think] [i think _that] [you_ know _i] _i_ do _like_ the_ looks [of] _those_ [. _i] don't_ [know] _why_ _why_ [they] wouldn't _go_ _with_ _something_ _that's_ _more_ comfortable . 
A|64| B: nissan . 
B|65| M: nasaki . 
A|66| B: no . no no . nissan [is] japanese . 
B|67| M: [oh] _okay ._ 
A|68| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh] 
B|69| M: _yeah_ _that's_ [the] [one] [i] [was] thinking [of] . 
A|70| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] . 
A|72| B: [yeah .] [and uh] _if i_ couldn't [have] my luxury maxima then _i'd_ _buy_ [me] [a] fancy little red c r x sports _car_ 
B|73| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|74| B: _i mean_ [you know] every every [one] [of] us [have] two sides 
B|75| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|76| B: [yeah .] now _what_ about [you] _if_ [you] _could_ [have] [the] _car_ [that you] wanted _what_ [would] [you] get 
B|77| M: _uh well _i_ _i_ don't_ [know [i] think] [uh you know] [what] [i'd] _really _like_ to have_ [is] _something that [i_ could] afford . 
A|78| B: [and] [why] ? 
B|79| M: [why] [not [and] [i] think] _that's_ [what] [i would] _do ._ 
A|80| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| M: [i mean] [i'm] [not] saying [i would] [buy [a] new car] [but [i] would] [definitely] [buy [a] used car .] 
A|82| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh [.] yeah .] see there 
B|83| M: [and [i] like] _that too ._ 
A|84| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: [but uh] . 
A|86| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh [.] i] tell [you] [that's] sad [too] because there [one] time ford [was] [the] best [that] [was] made . 
B|87| M: [yeah .] 
A|88| B: [really] [was] . 
B|89| M: _i don't_ [know] [but you] [you] [got] [to] look _at_ [the] history . 
A|90| B: [and uh [i] i] [really] [have] [not] seen now _a lot of_ [the] american [cars] actually are are parts are produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled here _or_ vice versa . 
B|91| M: right . 
A|92| B: [of] course . 
B|93| M: _okay ._ 
A|94| B: [okay] [uh] [at] any rate [do [you] have] color preferences _or_ [what] [would] be [the] features [that you] [would] be looking for ? 
B|95| M: [well] [uh] . 
A|96| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: um . 
A|98| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh [.] yeah .] [oh] wow . _we_ [like the] _stuff_ [that] glitters 
B|99| M: [yeah .] 
A|100| B: [good] . there's nothing wrong [with] [that] . actually [i think] probably _if i_ were _going to_ get _if i_ were _going to_ be practical _which_ doesn't _mean [i_ would] be [i would] prefer white . because simply because it's [more] visible [at] night . 
B|101| M: right . right . 
A|102| B: [and] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] now [the] interior [okay] [i don't] care about [the] interior just as long as it's [not] black _or_ red . 
B|103| M: uh-uh . 
A|104| B: [but] _if i_ had [the] little red c r x [i] guess [the] interior [would] _have to_ be black leather [and] [i'd] _have to_ live [with] [that] . [and] _if i_ [got] [the] c r x [it] [would] _have [to_ [have] a] _real_ [good] sound system [in] [it] because [i'd] want [that too .] 
B|105| M: [yeah .] 
A|106| B: [i'd] just [go] back [to] my teenage years [and] just throw all my experience [to] [the] wind 
B|107| M: [uh] [oh] [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|108| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [so] .

A|112| B: [that's] [okay .] 
B|113| M: [i'm] [not] [going to] [do] [it .] 
A|114| B: no no no [. i] generally [would] [uh] prefer [to] _listen [to_ [uh] well _i] listen to_ k c b [i] _a lot_ [but i] will _listen to_ [the] news [and] [the] [and] [the] traffic [and] [those] things [at] work . 
B|115| M: uh-uh [. yeah .] 
A|116| B: [but] _if_ [i'm] [going to] be traveling [in] [that] [car] for any period [of] time [i] want some _real_ [good] classical _music ._ 
B|117| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|118| B: [i] love classical _music_ [and] [you] just can't enjoy [it] unless you've [got] [a good] sound system [to] produce all [the] all [the] characteristics [of] [the] instruments . 
B|119| M: right . 
A|120| B: [so] [i do] love classical _music_ _or_ [it] _or_ _or_ [uh] contemporary classical . 
B|121| M: [well [i] [i] like] both kinds [of] [music [.] i like] [i don't] [like the] [real] hard rock [or] [i] don [like the] [really] heavy metal [stuff] . 
A|122| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|123| M: [uh [i] don't] [i [mean] [i] listen to] [like the] christian [music] [but i] don [i'm] [not] _sure_ [if [i] [like] the] [real] hard rock [or] 
A|124| B: [sure] [do .] 
B|125| M: [and uh] . 
A|126| B: w r r [and] [the] oasis are [the] two [that [i] listen to] [more] than anything else . 
B|127| M: uh-uh . [well i] [i've] [been] listening [to] [a lot of] different [uh] [new] [music [.] [i] don't] [know] [which] artist [it is] [but uh] . 
A|128| B: [and [i] do like] them . [and] [i'd] [like to [have] a] compact disc player [in] [the] [car .] [that] [would] be [something that [i] would] [really like] . 
B|129| M: [well] 
A|130| B: [those] compact discs [really] are [good] for [cars] because [they] [don't] melt 
B|131| M: [oh] [they] [do] ? 
A|132| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
B|133| M: [oh .] 
A|134| B: [you know] there's nothing [in] there [that] can wrap around [the] [the] [uh] rollers [or] anything . [it] seems [like] [a] [really] [good] answer [to] portable [music] [that you] can choose . 
B|135| M: right .
