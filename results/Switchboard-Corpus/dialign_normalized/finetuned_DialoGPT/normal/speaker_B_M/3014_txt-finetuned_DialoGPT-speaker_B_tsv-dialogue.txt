B|3| M: _yeah ._ 
A|4| B: _well , i_ _really_ , _the_ last _car_ _we_ _got_ _was_ _a_ , _was_ _a used car _._ i_ _really_ _don't_ prefer buying _a new _car_ _._ i _like_ to_ let somebody else pay for _that_ 
B|5| M: _yeah ._ 
A|6| B: _but , uh_ mine _was_ _a_ year old , 
B|7| M: _yeah ._ 
A|8| B: [and] _we_ [bought it] for _very_ functional purposes , 
B|9| M: _yeah ._ 
A|10| B: [and] _that_ _was_ _we_ [bought] _a_ station wagon . _we_ wanted an economical _car_ _to_ operate , 
B|11| M: right . 
A|12| B: _but_ _we_ wanted _one_ _that_ _could_ carry _a lot of_ equipment . _so_ _, we_ chose _a_ nissan stanza wagon . 
B|13| M: [uh] . 
A|14| B: [and] _i've_ never _been_ sorry , 
B|15| M: [well ,] _that's_ nice . 
A|16| B: however _the_ need for _that_ kind _of_ _car_ has changed now , 
B|17| M: _uh ,_

B|19| M: _uh , well _,_ _that_ _,_ that_ sounds [like] _you _have_ a_ [very] [, uh] [uh ,] refined taste _in_ _cars ._

B|21| M: [well ,] _that's_ _, that_ [is] _a good_ way [to] _do_ _it ._ 
A|22| B: _i think _that_ _i_ would_ _like _to_ ,_ _if_ _you know _,_ we_ all say , _if _i_ could_ [have] _the_ _car_ [i] always wanted _i would_ either _buy a_ nissan maxima [, uh ,]

B|33| M: _yeah_ , [i'm] _sure_ [they] _would ._ 
A|34| B: _but i_ had [, uh ,] had [a] ford escort [that] absolutely needed taps _the_ day _we_ _got_ [it .] 
B|35| M: _yeah ._ 
A|36| B: [uh _,] you know _, i_ mean_ [it] _was_ ready for _the_ graveyard . 
B|37| M: [well , i] [know [,] uh] . 
A|38| B: _and i_ spent as much on [that] _car_ [in] twelve months as [i] spent for _the_ _car ._ 
B|39| M: _that's_ right . 
A|40| B: _so_ , 
B|41| M: [well ,] _that's_ [a] pretty [good] deal . 
A|42| B: [and] [that] _was_ just trying [to] hold us , getting out _of_ [that] _was_ _a used car ._ 
B|43| M: _yeah_ , _yeah _._ yeah ._ 
A|44| B: [and] [it] _was_ an older _car_ , 
B|45| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|46| B: _but _, you_ know ,_ escort [is] supposed _to [have_ a] great track record as far as sales . 
B|47| M: _yeah ._ 
A|48| B: _but_ it's just , [it] just _was_ _not_ [and] [you] get stung [a] time _or_ two ,

B|51| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! et !! grammar !! [you] !! line !! clamation !! [you] !! xtended !! 
A|52| B: _so_ [, i] just trusted _the_ consumer reports [and] _the_ auto [, uh ,] reports 
B|53| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|54| B: had my son who knows _a lot_ about [that ,] study them thoroughly _, and_ he gave _me_ four choices _of_ [cars] [to] _buy_ 
B|55| M: [uh] . 
A|56| B: an escort _definitely_ _was_ _not_ among them . [in] fact , there wasn't an american _car_ [in] there . 
B|57| M: [uh [,] uh] . 
A|58| B: [uh ,] _the_ nissan came [and _,] and_ _we_ [bought] _the_ nissan for functional purposes _not_ _what_ _the_ consumer reports said _we_ should get . 
B|59| M: right . 
A|60| B: _but_ [it] served our needs . [uh ,] later on his reports , _the_ reports [that] he studied showed [that [, uh] ,] nissan _was_ head [and] shoulders above _the_ rest [in] _the_ [in] _the_ class [that] _we_ were looking for . [and] [that _,] and_ _i'd_ rather [have a] maxima than [a] cadillac _. i_ _really_ [would .] it's _not_ necessarily prestige , 
B|61| M: _yeah ._ 
A|62| B: _but_ it's comfort . [uh ,] there's _a lot of_ features on there [that] are desirable _if_ you're _going to_ pay [that] kind _of_ money for [a] _car ._ [uh ,] 
B|63| M: [well ,] _that's_ true [. [i] think] [, [i] think [that] [,] you know _, i] , _i_ do _like_ the_ looks [of] _those_ [. _i] don't_ [know] _why_ , _why_ [they] wouldn't _go_ _with_ _something_ _that's_ _more_ comfortable . 
A|64| B: nissan . 
B|65| M: nasaki . 
A|66| B: no . no , no . nissan [is] japanese . 
B|67| M: [oh _,] _okay_ ._ 
A|68| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh] , 
B|69| M: _yeah_ , _that's_ [the] [one] [i] [was] thinking [of] . 
A|70| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] . 
A|72| B: [yeah .] [and , uh ,] _if i_ couldn't [have] my luxury maxima then _i'd_ _buy_ [me] [a] fancy little red c r x sports _car_ 
B|73| M: [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|74| B: _i mean [,_ you know ,] every every [one] [of] us [have] two sides 
B|75| M: [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|76| B: [yeah .] now _what_ about _you ,_ _if_ [you] _could_ [have] [the] _car_ [that] [you] wanted _what_ [would] [you] get 
B|77| M: _uh , well _, i_ _, i_ don't_ [know , [i] think] [, uh] [you know] [what] [i'd] _really _like_ to have_ [is] _something that [i_ could] afford . 
A|78| B: [and] [why] ? 
B|79| M: [why] [not] [, [and] [i] think] _that's_ [what] [i would] _do ._ 
A|80| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| M: [i mean ,] [i'm] [not] saying [i would] [buy [a] new car] [but [i] would] [definitely] [buy [a] used car .] 
A|82| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh [.] yeah .] see there , 
B|83| M: [and [i] like] [that ,] _too ._ 
A|84| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: [but , uh] . 
A|86| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh [.] i] tell [you] [that's] sad [too] because there [one] time ford [was] [the] best [, that] [was] made . 
B|87| M: [yeah .] 
A|88| B: [really] [was] . 
B|89| M: _i don't_ [know ,] [but , [you] [,] you] [got] [to] look _at_ [the] history . 
A|90| B: [and , uh [, i] , i] [really] [have] [not] seen , now _a lot of_ [the] american [cars] actually are , are , parts are produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled here _or_ vice versa . 
B|91| M: right . 
A|92| B: [of] course . 
B|93| M: _okay ._ 
A|94| B: [okay] [uh ,] [at] any rate [do [you] have] color preferences _or_ [what] [would] be [the] features [that] [you] [would] be looking for ? 
B|95| M: [well [,] uh] . 
A|96| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: um . 
A|98| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh [.] yeah .] [oh ,] wow . _we_ [like the] _stuff_ [that] glitters 
B|99| M: [yeah .] 
A|100| B: [good] . there's nothing wrong [with] [that] . actually [i think] probably _if i_ were _going to_ get _if i_ were _going to_ be practical , _which_ doesn't [mean] [i would] be [, [i] would] prefer white . because , simply because it's [more] visible [at] night . 
B|101| M: right . right . 
A|102| B: [and ,] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] now [the] interior [, okay] [, i don't] care about [the] interior just as long as it's [not] black _or_ red . 
B|103| M: uh-uh . 
A|104| B: [but] _if i_ had [the] little red c r x [, i] guess [the] interior [would] _have to_ be black leather [and] [i'd] _have to_ live [with] [that] . [and] _if i_ [got] [the] c r x [it] [would] _have [to_ [have] a] _real_ [good] sound system [in] [it] because [i'd] want [that] [too .] 
B|105| M: [yeah .] 
A|106| B: [i'd] just [go] back [to] my teenage years [and] just throw all my experience [to] [the] wind 
B|107| M: [uh ,] [oh ,] [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|108| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [so] .

B|113| M: [i'm] [not] [going to] [do] [it .] 
A|114| B: no , no , no [. i] generally [would] [uh ,] prefer [to] _listen [to_ [, [uh] ,] well _, i] listen to_ k c b [i] _a lot_ [but i] will _listen to_ [the] news [and] [the] [, and] [the] traffic [and] [those] things [at] work . 
B|115| M: uh-uh [. yeah .] 
A|116| B: [but] _if_ [i'm] [going to] be traveling [in] [that] [car] for any period [of] time [, i] want some _real_ [good] classical _music ._ 
B|117| M: [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|118| B: [i] love classical _music [,_ and] [you] just can't enjoy [it] unless you've [got] [a good] sound system [to] produce all [the] , all [the] characteristics [of] [the] instruments . 
B|119| M: right . 
A|120| B: [so] [i do] love classical _music_ _or_ [it] _or ,_ _or [,_ uh ,] contemporary classical . 
B|121| M: [well [, i] , [i] like] both kinds [of] [music [.] i like] [, i don't] [like the] [real] hard rock [or] [i] don [like the] [really] heavy metal [stuff] . 
A|122| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|123| M: [uh [, i] don't] [, [i mean] [,] i listen to] [like the] christian [music ,] [but i] don , [i'm] [not] _sure_ [if [i] [like] the] [real] hard rock [or ,] 
A|124| B: [sure] [do .] 
B|125| M: [and , uh] . 
A|126| B: w r r [and] [the] oasis are [the] two [that [i] listen [to] ,] [more] than anything else . 
B|127| M: uh-uh . [well [, i] [,] i've] [been] listening [to] [a lot of] different [, uh ,] [new] [music [.] [i] don't] [know] [which] artist [it is] , [but , uh] . 
A|128| B: [and [i] do like] them . [and] [i'd] [like to [have] a] compact disc player [in] [the] [car .] [that] [would] be , [something that [i] would] [really like] . 
B|129| M: [well ,] 
A|130| B: [those] compact discs , [really] are [good] for [cars] because [they] [don't] melt , 
B|131| M: [oh ,] [they] [do] ? 
A|132| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
B|133| M: [oh .] 
A|134| B: [you know ,] there's nothing [in] there [that] can wrap around [the] , [the] [, uh ,] rollers [or] anything . [it] seems [like] [a] [really] [good] answer [to] portable [music [,] that] [you] can choose . 
B|135| M: right .
