A|20| B: yes _it is ._ _it's a_ tough , tough question . _it really _is_ . i_ suspect _i _would_ be_ _, uh , you know _,_ a_ lot [more] favor _of_ [it] _if _,_ you know ,_ _one of_ _my children_ were _, you know ,_ brutally killed , _or_ [something like _that] ._ [like] [i] say [, i think] [it] depends [on] _how_ personally affected _, you know [,_ you] might _be_ _by_ _it ._ 
B|21| M: [uh-huh .]

A|32| B: yes [, i think] _most_ states [do] [have] capital punishment . yes _. but [,_ i think] [the] u s [is] _one of the_ few countries [that] still _do ._ 
B|33| M: [oh [,] really] ? 
A|34| B: yes [, they're] only [, i] _was_ reading [something] _about_ [it] [the] other day [, i think] there _was_ only [like] six _or_ eight countries _in the_ world _, that_ [have] capital punishment still . 
B|35| M: uh-oh . 
A|36| B: [a] lot _of_ _them_ had [to have] elected [not] _to do_ [so] . _now_ _i don't know ,_ _what they do_ _in_ place _of_ _it ._ _you know ,_ maybe [it's] life _in_ prisonment _or_ _, you know ,_ [something] [, i] _i don't know how_ [they] handle [it] [i] _was_ surprised [to] learn [that] [so] few countries [have] capital punishment . 
B|37| M: [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [oh ,] yes . yes _, a_ lot _of_ _them_ [do] [get] their sentences commuted [to] [something] _else_ . 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: yes . 
B|41| M: [i] mean _, it's [,_ it] [, it] _may_ [not] _be the best_ [system] [but] [it's] _the best_ [one] [that] exists . 
A|42| B: [uh-huh .] yes . 
B|43| M: [but [,] uh [,] i don't [know [,] i] think] _that ,_ i'm [not] [a] lawyer [by] any means _, but_ _i think _,_ i would_ [think] [that it's a] _very_ important aspect [of] [a] civil case . 
A|44| B: _right_ [, the] first _appeal_ [is] automatic , [so] [that] delays [it] [for] [a] few [years] [just] _right_ off [the] bat . 
B|45| M: [yeah ,] [right .] 
A|46| B: there's , there's [a] lot _of _,_ you know ,_ last minute [, uh ,] _things_ [that] happen cause [a person] [not] [to ,] _have to_ [go] through [the] whole _thing_ . 
B|47| M: uh-uh . 
A|48| B: yes , [uh-huh .] [that's , that's] fairly recent [, i don't know ,] _how_ recent [, but] fairly recent _, _in_ the_ state [of] texas . before [that _,] it was_ [, uh ,] [death] [by] electrocution . 
B|49| M:  !!!!,!! [oh] !! 
A|50| B: yes [, it] certainly does . 
B|51| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|52| B: yes _, it would_ [almost] _have to_ [be] [, i] suppose . _if_ [you _,] if_ [you] had [to] chose _, i guess_ _i would , i_ am _sure i would_ take [the] lethal injection . 
B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: yes , absolutely . 
B|55| M: [uh [,] i don't [know ,] i] [just] , i'm , i've always felt [that [,] uh [,] uh] [you know [,] [if] [,] if] [they] _would have_ [, uh] ... 
A|56| B: [it's _a] [,_ [it's] a] tough question . _it really [is_ . _i] guess_ [, if] [i] had [to] say yes _or_ no [, i would] say _, you know ,_ yes [. [i] [, i] [would] _have] to_ lean toward capital punishment _, you know ,_ [for] _certain_ crimes . 
B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: no [, i don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|59| M: [right .] 
A|60| B: [i think _,] we_ hope [that] [it] will [be] _, you know ,_ _some_ sort [of] deterrent _or_ _, you know ,_ an eye [for] an eye type _thing_ , _or_ [something like _that] ._ 
B|61| M: [right .] 
A|62| B: _some_ _of the_ crimes [are] [just] [so] brutal [and] [so _,] you know ,_ useless . this [may] seem [to] [be the best] _way_ [out] [. [i] don't know] . 
B|63| M: [yeah [,] [i] , i] agree [with] _you ._ 
A|64| B: easiest _way_ [out] maybe . no [, i don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|65| M: [yeah .] 
A|66| B: yes , especially [the] murder rate , its [just] gone crazy . yes . 
B|67| M: [yeah [,] i] mean [, [i] , i] [know [that] [.] i] mean [i _,] it's ,_ i'm [, i guess] i'm [in] [a [,] in] [a] real strange mood [right] [now] . i'm trying [to] [think] [of] [what] [else] [we] can talk [about] . 
A|68| B: absolutely . yes [, i] wish [i] had [the] answer [for] [that ,] everybody does . 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: yes [, it's] nothing [to] [be] proud _of ,_ certainly _not ._ 
B|71| M: [i , [i] ,] i'm [sure] [it's [not] [.] [i] [think] it's a] shame [that [,] uh , you] [have [to] have] [a] degree [in] [, uh] [in] , selection [of] jury , jury selection [and] [that] [you] [have] [a [,] a] _very_ narrow view [of [,] [of] the] jury selection . 
A|72| B: yes . yes , [so] [have] [we] been [very] , [very] fortunate . 
B|73| M: [yeah , it] [, it was] [a] [very] difficult choice . 
A|74| B: [that's] [right .] absolutely . 
B|75| M: [uh [,] and] [i don't know how] [you] combat [that [,] uh , [you] [,] i] mean [you [,] you] must [have] [a] [certain] frame [of] thought [on] [it] [, but] [i think] [that [,] [that] [,] you] [have [to] have] [some] frame [of] reason [to] believe [that] somebody [else] [is] worse . 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [but] [i think] [that's] [what] [we] all [have to] face . 
A|78| B: absolutely . 
B|79| M: [so [,] [i] [, i] think] [that [,] [that] ,] um . 
A|80| B: [uh-huh .] [that's] [right .] 
B|81| M: [you know [,] and] [i think] [that's] [one of the] [things] [that's] [so] sad . 
A|82| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| M: [but [,] uh [,] [i think] [,] i don't [know ,] [i] , i] [do] , i'm [not] [sure [i would] , i] mean [, i would] [like] [to] [know that] [my children] [, you know ,] [would be] okay [with] [it [.] but [,] uh] . 
A|84| B: [so] [would] [i , i] fortunately [, i] [have] never been [in] [that] circumstance [, i] hope [i] never am , [like] , [like] everybody [else] . 
B|85| M: [uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|86| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| M: [and] , um i'm [not] [sure] [what they do] [with] [it [.] i] mean [, you] can [appeal] [and] [they] can [appeal] again . 
A|88| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|89| M: [and] , um . 
A|90| B: [right .] 
B|91| M: [so ,] 
A|92| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| M: [and] [it's] [just] [not] [that] [people] [are] choosing [the] jury [or] [that] [people] aren't selected . 
A|94| B: _sure [,_ [it's ,] [it's] a] big responsibility [, _it] really [is_ .] 
B|95| M: [it really _is] [,_ and] [, uh , you know [,] and] [i] [know ,] i'm [, i] work [in the] legal department [and] [, and] [we] [have to] hire lawyers , 
A|96| B: yes . [so] [would] [i] . 
B|97| M: [i think [,] uh [, you know [,] i] [think] it's] probably [the] [right] [thing] [to [do] [.] [i] think ,] i'm [not] [sure ,] though [, [that] [,] that] [the] jury [system] works [that] [way] . 
A|98| B: yes . absolutely . 
B|99| M: [but] [i think] [that [,] you know [,] it] [, it [would] be] [something] [that] [you] [would] look [into] [, you] [would be] able [to do] , you'd [be] able [, you] could [be] able able [to] make friends [with] these [people] , 
A|100| B: [it [is] [,] [it's] a] tough subject [, [it] really [is] .] 
B|101| M: [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [right .] [that's] [right .] 
B|103| M: [uh ,] we're , we've [, we] [have to] make ourselves [a] pact [with] [the] [people] [that] [we] [find] [the] [most] ways [to] help [them] . 
A|104| B: [well ,] thank [you [,] it's] nice talking [to] [you .] 
B|105| M: [you] too . 
A|106| B: [uh-huh .] bye-bye .
