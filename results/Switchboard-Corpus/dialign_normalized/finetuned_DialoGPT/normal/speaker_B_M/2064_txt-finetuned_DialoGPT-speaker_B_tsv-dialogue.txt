B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _oh_ [yeah] _oh_ absolutely _yeah it_ goes [on] _for_ [years] [and] [years] [and] costs hundreds _of_ thousands _of_ dollars taxpayer money . 
B|15| M: _yeah ._ 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [it's] sad [. i] mean _i i_ _do_ feel sorry [for] _people_ who _are_ [you] [you] _do_ realize [that] [the] average [person] doesn't _go_ [out] [and] [and] _do_ _something like that_ 
A|18| B: yes . 
B|19| M: [and] um . 
A|20| B: yes _it is ._ _it's a_ tough tough question . _it really _is_ . i_ suspect _i _would_ be_ _uh you know_ [a] lot [more] favor _of_ [it] _if_ [you know] _one of_ _my children_ were [you know] brutally killed _or_ [something like _that] ._ [like] [i] say [i think] [it] depends [on] _how_ personally affected [you know] [you] might _be_ _by_ _it ._ 
B|21| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: _oh_ absolutely . [that's] _right ._ 
B|23| M: [i] mean _they're_ _they_ _they_ can kill somebody pretty easily _but_ _they're_ [not] going _to you_ can't [you] [don't know] _they_ [don't] _have_ [the] mental capacity [to] kill [a person] . 
A|24| B: [not] [with] me personally . _it is_ [with] [a] lot _of_ other [people] . 
B|25| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| B: [it's not] [not] [to] me personally no . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] 
A|28| B: no . 
B|29| M: _so_ 
A|30| B: [uh-huh .] yes . [that's] [a] _it's a_ tough tough question _it really _is_ ._ 
B|31| M: [yeah [it] is . [i] think [i] _think] it's_ important _to have_ [the] support . 
A|32| B: yes [i think] _most_ states [do] [have] capital punishment . yes _. _but_ i think_ [the] u s [is] _one of the_ few countries [that] still _do ._ 
B|33| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|34| B: yes [they're] only [i] _was_ reading [something] _about_ [it] [the] other day [i think] there _was_ only [like] six _or_ eight countries _in the_ world [that] [have] capital punishment still . 
B|35| M: uh-oh . 
A|36| B: [a] lot _of_ _them_ had [to have] elected [not] _to do_ [so] . _now_ _i don't know_ _what they do_ _in_ place _of_ _it ._ [you know] maybe [it's] life _in_ prisonment _or_ [you know] [something] [i _i] don't know how_ [they] handle [it] [i] _was_ surprised [to] learn [that] [so] few countries [have] capital punishment . 
B|37| M: [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [oh] yes . yes [a] lot _of_ _them_ [do] [get] their sentences commuted [to] [something] _else_ . 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: yes . 
B|41| M: [i] mean [it's] [it] [it] _may_ [not] _be the best_ [system] [but] [it's] _the best_ [one] [that] exists . 
A|42| B: [uh-huh .] yes . 
B|43| M: [but] [uh] [i don't [know] [i] think] [that] i'm [not] [a] lawyer [by] any means [but [i think] i would] [think] [that it's a] _very_ important aspect [of] [a] civil case . 
A|44| B: _right_ [the] first _appeal_ [is] automatic [so] [that] delays [it] [for] [a] few [years] [just] _right_ off [the] bat . 
B|45| M: [yeah] [right .] 
A|46| B: there's there's [a] lot [of] [you know] last minute [uh] _things_ [that] happen cause [a person] [not] [to _have] to_ [go] through [the] whole _thing_ . 
B|47| M: uh-uh . 
A|48| B: yes [uh-huh .] [that's that's] fairly recent _i don't know how_ recent [but] fairly recent _in the_ state [of] texas . before [that] _it was_ [uh] [death] [by] electrocution . 
B|49| M:  !!!!!! [oh] !! 
A|50| B: yes [it] certainly does . 
B|51| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|52| B: yes _it would_ [almost] _have to_ [be] [i] suppose . _if_ [you] _if_ [you] had [to] chose _i guess_ _i would i_ am _sure i would_ take [the] lethal injection . 
B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: yes absolutely . 
B|55| M: [uh] [i don't [know] i] [just] i'm i've always felt [that] [uh] [uh you know] [if] [if] [they] _would have_ [uh] ... 
A|56| B: [it's a] [it's a] tough question . _it really [is_ . _i] guess_ [if] [i] had [to] say yes _or_ no [i would] say [you know] yes [. [i] [i] [would] _have] to_ lean toward capital punishment [you know] [for] _certain_ crimes . 
B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: no [i don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|59| M: [right .] 
A|60| B: [i think] _we_ hope [that] [it] will [be] [you know] _some_ sort [of] deterrent _or_ [you know] an eye [for] an eye type _thing_ _or_ [something like _that] ._ 
B|61| M: [right .] 
A|62| B: _some_ _of the_ crimes [are] [just] [so] brutal [and] [so] [you know] useless . this [may] seem [to] [be the best] _way_ [out] [. [i] don't know] . 
B|63| M: [yeah] [i i] agree [with] _you ._ 
A|64| B: easiest _way_ [out] maybe . no [i don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|65| M: [yeah .] 
A|66| B: yes especially [the] murder rate its [just] gone crazy . yes . 
B|67| M: [yeah] [i] mean [i i] [know [that] [.] i] mean [i] [it's] i'm [i guess] i'm [in] [a] [in] [a] real strange mood [right] [now] . i'm trying [to] [think] [of] [what] [else] [we] can talk [about] . 
A|68| B: absolutely . yes [i] wish [i] had [the] answer [for] [that] everybody does . 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: yes [it's] nothing [to] [be] proud [of] certainly _not ._ 
B|71| M: [i i] i'm _sure [it's_ [not] [.] [i] [think] it's a] shame [that] [uh you] [have [to] have] [a] degree [in] [uh] [in] selection [of] jury jury selection [and] [that] [you] [have] [a] [a] _very_ narrow view [of] [of the] jury selection . 
A|72| B: yes . yes [so] [have] [we] been [very] [very] fortunate . 
B|73| M: [yeah it] [it was] [a] [very] difficult choice . 
A|74| B: [that's] [right .] absolutely . 
B|75| M: [uh] [and] [i don't know how] [you] combat [that] [uh you] [i] mean [you] [you] must [have] [a] [certain] frame [of] thought [on] [it] [but i think] [that] [that] [you] [have [to] have] [some] frame [of] reason [to] believe [that] somebody [else] [is] worse . 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [but i think] [that's] [what] [we] all [have to] face . 
A|78| B: absolutely . 
B|79| M: [so] [i [i] think] [that] [that] um . 
A|80| B: [uh-huh .] [that's] [right .] 
B|81| M: [you know] [and] [i think] [that's] [one of the] [things] [that's] [so] sad . 
A|82| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| M: [but] [uh] [i think [i] don't [know] [i] i] [do] i'm [not] [sure [i would] i] mean [i would] [like] [to] [know that] [my children] [you know] [would be] okay [with] [it [.] but] [uh] . 
A|84| B: [so] [would [i] i] fortunately [i] [have] never been [in] [that] circumstance [i] hope [i] never am [like] [like] everybody [else] . 
B|85| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| M: [and] um i'm [not] [sure] [what they do] [with] [it [.] i] mean [you] can [appeal] [and] [they] can [appeal] again . 
A|88| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|89| M: [and] um . 
A|90| B: [right .] 
B|91| M: [so] 
A|92| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| M: [and] [it's] [just] [not] [that] [people] [are] choosing [the] jury [or] [that] [people] aren't selected . 
A|94| B: [sure [it's] [it's] a] big responsibility _it really [is_ .] 
B|95| M: [it really is] [and] [uh you know] [and] [i] [know] i'm [i] work [in the] legal department [and] [and] [we] [have to] hire lawyers 
A|96| B: yes . [so] [would i] . 
B|97| M: [i think] [uh [you know] [i] [think] it's] probably [the] [right] [thing] [to [do] [.] [i] think] i'm [not] [sure] though [that] [that] [the] jury [system] works [that] [way] . 
A|98| B: yes . absolutely . 
B|99| M: [but i think] [that] [you know] [it] [it [would] be] [something] [that] [you] [would] look [into] [you] [would be] able [to do] you'd [be] able [you] could [be] able able [to] make friends [with] these [people] 
A|100| B: [it is] [it's a] tough subject [it really [is] .] 
B|101| M: [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [right .] [that's] [right .] 
B|103| M: [uh] we're we've [we] [have to] make ourselves [a] pact [with] [the] [people] [that] [we] [find] [the] [most] ways [to] help [them] . 
A|104| B: [well] thank [you] [it's] nice talking [to [you] .] 
B|105| M: [you] too .
