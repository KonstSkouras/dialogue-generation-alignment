B|3| M: _but , uh_ _i_ don tinker _with_ [it] _too_ _much_ _. uh _,_ i_ _, i_ _just_ _think_ _it's ,_ _it's_ _not_ _very_ good _for the_ _people_ who _have ,_ _have to_ _live_ _with_ _it ._ 
A|4| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._

B|13| M: _i mean _,_ i mean _,_ it ,_ _it's _,_ it_ _was_ _a case_ _of_ _, uh _,_ it_ seemed , uh-hilmable _. _i_ mean_ _the , _the ,_ uh_ [the evidence] _was_ , _was_ presented _so_ openly [and , uh .] 
A|14| B: _well , i think_ [that] should [be] likewise decided _by_ [the] _jury _,_ you know ,_ because _, i don't know [, i_ think] [a] _jury_ _would_ [be] less likely [to] [just] send [a] man [to] death [just] _for ,_ any reason , 
B|15| M: [right .] 
A|16| B: [i don't know] [a] judge might [be] [a] little _more_ cold-blooded _about it ._ 
B|17| M: _uh [,_ _i] guess_ _it's ,_ _it's_ [the] idea [that] [if] [you] _have _a_ trial_ [by] [jury _,] _that ,_ uh_ [that] _if _they_ can't_ _prove_ beyond [a] reasonable doubt _that the_ _person_ _is_ _guilty_ , _then _they_ have_ [the] [right] _to , _to ,_ uh_ [you know] take _their_ first , first , second , third _, and_ fourth degree . 
A|18| B: [yeah [,] i don't _think] we_ , 
B|19| M: _i mean ,_ i've been _in_ texas [and] _pennsylvania_ _and _, and_ , uh [,_ _i] guess_ _there's_ _some_ _, there's_ _a lot of_ _things_ [that] [i] [would] _like_ [to] [know] [more] _about ._ 
A|20| B: no , huh-uh . no _we don't_ . 
B|21| M: [we don't] either . 
A|22| B: _yeah ._ 
B|23| M: _but _, uh_ ,_ we're _, we_ _are_ doing [it] this _year_ _, _so_ ._ 
A|24| B: _uh-huh ._ _oh , yeah_ _they're_ always [in] florida . florida [and] louisiana [, _i think] [,_ and , uh ,] [some] _of [the_ ,] other southern states . 
B|25| M: yes [. yeah ,] i've heard _that ._ 
A|26| B: course [they have] such [a] crime [problem] because [they have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] uh-hue . 
A|28| B: _get_ [that] unemployment _way_ up [so] [then] [people] _, you know_ tend towards crime [, and] [then they] [they] _start_ stiffening [the] penalties . 
B|29| M: [right .] 
A|30| B: [well _,] in_ florida seems [like] [, uh ,] two or three times [a] [year] . [it's] constantly on [the ,] 
B|31| M: [yeah ,] [it's] [just] [a] _, it_ [just] [a] real [problem] _. _i_ mean_ _they _,_ they_ _just don't_ [do] anything [about it .] 
A|32| B: [yeah .] no _, that's true ._ course [they [have] a] requirement [that [, uh] [,] that] every single appeal must [be] permitted . 
B|33| M: [right .] 
A|34| B: _so ,_ [of] course [, [the ,] the] attorneys , 
B|35| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| B: _they go_ all [the] _way_ up _to the_ supreme court _, you [know_ .] 
B|37| M: [oh , [yeah] [,] [yeah] .] 
A|38| B: [they] almost always _get_ thrown [right] back _out_ again , [but] [they [have] to] [have] every single appeal made open [to] them . 
B|39| M: [right .] 
A|40| B: [some] [of] these guys [are] really _, uh , you know ,_ violent son [of] sam killers [and] stuff [like] [that _,] you [know_ .] 
B|41| M: [right .] 
A|42| B: [i mean _,] they ,_ 
B|43| M: [but] [i think] [it's] _just ,_ 
A|44| B: everyone knows _they're_ going _get ,_ [not] going _to get out_ . 
B|45| M: [right .] 
A|46| B: [yeah .] 
B|47| M: [and] [they] [get [,] [they] go] [to the] principal's office _and , you know [,_ and] [they [,] they] _just [,_ _you] can't_ [do] anything . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: _so ._ 
A|50| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| M: [and , uh [,] i] [, _i think] that's_ one [of the] reasons [that [, uh] .] 
A|52| B: [i think] [so .] 
B|53| M:  !!! % !! remind _me_ . 
A|54| B: [uh ,] [a lot [of] [the] , [the ,] the] other violent crimes [i don't] really _feel that_ strongly [about .] although [, you know ,] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole , 
B|55| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|56| B: [i mean ,] these guys [are] certainly [not] going [to [, uh] ,] [be] [, [they] can't] [, i mean] _they're_ getting into drugs [and] fights [and] all [that] stuff [in] prison [. [i] don't think] [the] parole _system_ [is] really helping [that much] 
B|57| M: [uh .] 
A|58| B: reduce [the] violence _in the_ prisons _. [i think_ that's] its _only_ purpose [is] , [is] [, you know [,] to] reduce [, uh , the] violence _in the_ prisons [so] [people] behave themselves [a] little bit better [if they] _think they're_ going _to get_ off early . off earlier . 
B|59| M: [yeah [,] that's true .] 
A|60| B: [but] [some] [of] these guys [just don't] care [, you [know] .] _and _so_ [,_ uh ,] 
B|61| M: [yeah [,] that's true .] 
A|62| B: [yeah ,] [right ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|63| M: [and] [they [,] they [,] you] [don't know ,] [they're] [just] happy [to get out] [of] [it .] 
A|64| B: _um_ [, that's] possible [i guess] . 
B|65| M: [and , uh .] 
A|66| B: _um_ [, so] _where_ [do] [you] _live in_ [pennsylvania] ? 
B|67| M: [um] pittsburgh . 
A|68| B: [oh ,] _okay [._ [i] don't think] [i] really _know [that_ .] 
B|69| M: [uh [,] i [think] they're] trying [to] [start] [some] programs down [in the] elementary schools . 
A|70| B: because _, uh , you know [,_ that] all depends , [too] , on _where_ [you] [are] at . [that's] [, uh ,] sort [of] interesting [to get] opinions as [to] _where_ different parts [of the] country [are] . because [the] [more] grass root country [, uh ,] parts [of the] country tend [to , to] support capital punishment , _where_ [the] places [that] [are] [, you know ,] less [in] contact [with] crime [you know [,] [the ,] the] [more] , [more] urban [, i mean] less , 
B|71| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| M: [and , uh] [and so] _i'm_ [not] [, i] don [, i think] _i'm_ pretty far from [, uh] [you know] _what_ [i] call [a] nut [and] bolts kind [of] attitude . 
A|74| B: two hours _where_ ? 
B|75| M: [uh [,] i] [live in] garland . 
A|76| B: [oh ,] _okay ._ near polk ? 
B|77| M: [yeah .] 
A|78| B: polk institute . [it's [,] uh ,] an old [, uh ,] university [that] turned into [a] place [for the] mentally retarded [. uh ,] 
B|79| M: [oh] . 
A|80| B: [very] old [, uh ,] historical place [there] . 
B|81| M: [oh] . 
A|82| B: sharon , pennsylvania's up [there] . 
B|83| M: [yeah [,] that's] [where] i've seen [it .] 
A|84| B: [yeah .] 
B|85| M: [that's] [a] nice area . 
A|86| B: [oh ,] _okay ._ 
B|87| M: [okay .] 
A|88| B: _in that_ [case] , maybe [, you [know] .] 
B|89| M: [yeah [.] [i] mean [,] i] [know that] _my_ older brother [and] sister-in-law , they've been [in] [a] relationship [for ,] [oh ,] probably twenty-five years , 
A|90| B: [right .] [that's true [.] yeah _,] [well_ [,] it [,] it [,] you know [,] you] [get] certain circumstances [where] [you] hear [about] these [people] [that] [have [,] you know ,] stolen kids [and , you know ,] done terrible [things] [to] them [and] killed them [and , you know [,] that] sort [of] thing , 
B|91| M: [uh [,] well] 
A|92| B: [you] [just] [like] [, i don't] want [that] [person] sharing [the] earth [with] [me] [, you _know [,] i_ mean [,] that] [is] [just] terrible . 
B|93| M: [uh ,] 
A|94| B: [and _, uh ,] you know [,_ we] had [a case] [like] [that] here [and ,] on [the] other hand [, you know ,] [people] [are] saying [that] because [the ,] he knows , because [the] criminals [know [that] [the] , uh ,] penalties can [be] [very] severe [, they [,] uh [,] there's] less criminals [that] [are] [, you know ,] turning themselves [in] , or [, you know ,] pleading or whatever , because [they] [know [that] the] judge [, you know [,] if they] find them [guilty] [is] [, you know ,] has [the , the] opportunity [to] sentence them [, you know ,] [for ,] [for the] death sentence . 
B|95| M: [yeah .] 
A|96| B: [yeah .] [well ,] [i'm] [just] saying [that [,] that [,] that's] [what] [, [the ,] the] client , lawyers [are] saying . [they're] saying [that [,] you know [,] you know ,] [more] [of] [my] clients [would] [have] pleaded [guilty] [if they] [would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly _having_ [to , [to ,] [to] get] [a] death sentence because [you can't] plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] going [to] [be] . 
B|97| M: [right .] 
A|98| B: [right ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|99| M: [so [,] i don't know , i] [, [i] guess] [, i] _just [,_ i] [feel [that] the] justice [system] works [in] our favor [in that] we're [not] satisfied [with] [the] [system] [and] [i think] [it's] [just] [that] [there's] , [there] [is] [too] [much] [, uh] [you know] [the] justice systems [are] working [in] our favour . 
A|100| B: [yeah ,] [right .] 
B|101| M:  !!!!,!! ; !! remind [me] [of] [that] now . 
A|102| B: [uh-huh [.] i] [was] [just] saying [that] _way_ , [what] [they're] saying [is] [that] [they can't] [get] [people] [to] turn themselves [in] [then] . [and [so] [,] _we] [have_ _to] go_ through [a trial] [then] [to] [prove] [the] person's [guilty] . 
B|103| M: [uh [,] i] see . 
A|104| B: [and] perhaps [we] can [and] perhaps [we] [can't] [and so] [the] guy might [get] off . 
B|105| M: [well , i [think] [we] have] got [a] long [way] [to go] [. [i think] [,] uh , you know [,] [in] the] last ten years [, uh] [uh , the] [only] [way] [that] we've gone down [is] [to , uh] [to] [having] [a] unanimous verdict . 
A|106| B: [and , uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are] , [are] guys [that] [are] [, you know] going [to get] caught anyways [but [,] there's] always [a] few [of] those [people] [that] [are] [, you know ,] lost [their] head or whatever . 
B|107| M: [right .] 
A|108| B: anyways , [but [, uh] [.] yeah [,] we] [just] had [a] terrible [case] [in] virginia [where] [some] girl disappeared [and , and] [the] guy , [like] [i] said , he [just [,] uh ,] said [that] he took her , [but] he won't admit [that] she died or whatever [, and] he won't say [where] [the] body [is] because he knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know ,] mandatory life sentences [for] murder .
