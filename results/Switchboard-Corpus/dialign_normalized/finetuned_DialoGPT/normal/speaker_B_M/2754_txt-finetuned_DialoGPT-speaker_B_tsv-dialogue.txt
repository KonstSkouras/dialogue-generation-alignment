A|0| B: _and uh _._ yeah_ how _do_ _you_ _feel_ _about it_ ? 
B|1| M: _well i_ [uh] 
A|2| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| M: _but uh_ _i_ don tinker _with_ [it] _too_ _much_ _. uh_ _i_ _i_ _just_ _think_ _it's_ _it's_ _not_ _very_ good _for the_ _people_ who _have_ _have to_ _live_ _with_ _it ._ 
A|4| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|5| M: _but_ _i_ _i don't _think_ that's_ _right ._ 
A|6| B: [right] exactly . 
B|7| M: _you know_ _so_ _i_ _i_ you're [right] [you] see _i don't _know_ ._ 
A|8| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|9| M: _i don't_ _i think _that's_ true ._ 
A|10| B: [right .] _if if_ _the evidence_ _wasn't_ overwhelming [right] ? 
B|11| M: [yeah] [if] [it] [wasn't] [if _if] they_ didn't _have_ _the _the_ _uh_ the_ peer pressure _there_ wouldn't _be_ _that much_ _of_ _a_ _problem_ . 
A|12| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| M: _i mean_ _i mean_ [it] _it's_ [it] _was_ _a case_ _of_ [uh] [it] seemed uh-hilmable _. _i_ mean_ _the _the_ _uh_ [the_ evidence] _was_ _was_ presented _so_ openly [and uh .] 
A|14| B: _well i think_ [that] should [be] likewise decided _by_ [the] _jury_ [you know] because _i don't know [i_ think] [a] _jury_ _would_ [be] less likely [to] [just] send [a] man [to] death [just] [for] any reason 
B|15| M: [right .] 
A|16| B: [i don't know] [a] judge might [be] [a] little _more_ cold-blooded _about it ._ 
B|17| M: [uh] _i guess_ _it's_ _it's_ [the] idea [that] [if] [you] _have _a_ trial_ [by] [jury] _that uh that_ _if _they_ can't_ _prove_ beyond [a] reasonable doubt _that the_ _person_ _is_ _guilty_ _then _they_ have_ [the] [right] _to _to_ _uh_ you know_ take _their_ first first second third [and] fourth degree . 
A|18| B: [yeah] [i don't _think] we_ 
B|19| M: _i mean_ i've been _in_ texas [and] _pennsylvania_ _and [and_ uh] _i guess_ _there's_ _some_ _there's_ _a lot of_ _things_ [that] [i] [would] _like_ [to] _know more_ _about ._ 
A|20| B: no huh-uh . no _we don't_ . 
B|21| M: [we don't] either . 
A|22| B: _yeah ._ 
B|23| M: _but uh_ we're [we] _are_ doing [it] this _year_ _so ._ 
A|24| B: _uh-huh ._ _oh yeah_ _they're_ always [in] florida . florida [and] louisiana [i think] [and uh] [some] _of the_ other southern states . 
B|25| M: yes [. yeah] i've heard _that ._ 
A|26| B: course [they have] such [a] crime [problem] because [they have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] uh-hue . 
A|28| B: _get_ [that] unemployment _way_ up [so] [then] [people] [you know] tend towards crime [and] [then _they] they_ _start_ stiffening [the] penalties . 
B|29| M: [right .] 
A|30| B: [well] [in] florida seems [like] [uh] two or three times [a] [year] . [it's] constantly on [the] 
B|31| M: [yeah] [it's] [just] [a] [it] [just] [a] real [problem] _. _i_ mean [they_ they] _just don't_ [do] anything [about it .] 
A|32| B: [yeah .] no [that's true .] course [they [have] a] requirement [that uh that] every single appeal must [be] permitted . 
B|33| M: [right .] 
A|34| B: [so] [of] course [the the] attorneys 
B|35| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| B: _they go_ all [the] _way_ up _to the_ supreme court [you [know] .] 
B|37| M: [oh yeah] [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [they] almost always _get_ thrown [right] back _out_ again [but] [they [have] to] [have] every single appeal made open [to] them . 
B|39| M: [right .] 
A|40| B: [some] [of] these guys [are] really [uh you know] violent son [of] sam killers [and] stuff [like] [that] [you [know] .] 
B|41| M: [right .] 
A|42| B: [i mean they] 
B|43| M: [but] [i think] [it's] [just] 
A|44| B: everyone knows _they're_ going _get_ [not] going _to get out_ . 
B|45| M: [right .] 
A|46| B: [yeah .] 
B|47| M: [and] [they] [get] [they go] [to the] principal's office _and you know_ [and] [they they] [just] _you can't_ [do] anything . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: _so ._ 
A|50| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| M: [and uh] [i] _i think that's_ one [of the] reasons [that [uh] .] 
A|52| B: [i think] [so .] 
B|53| M:  !!! % !! remind _me_ . 
A|54| B: [uh] [a lot [of] [the] [the] the] other violent crimes [i don't] really _feel that_ strongly [about .] although [you know] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole 
B|55| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|56| B: [i mean] these guys [are] certainly [not] going [to uh] [be] [they can't] [i mean] _they're_ getting into drugs [and] fights [and] all [that] stuff [in] prison [. [i] don't think] [the] parole _system_ [is] really helping [that much] 
B|57| M: [uh .] 
A|58| B: reduce [the] violence _in the_ prisons _. [i think_ that's] its _only_ purpose [is] [is] [you know] [to] reduce [uh the] violence _in the_ prisons [so] [people] behave themselves [a] little bit better [if they] _think they're_ going _to get_ off early . off earlier . 
B|59| M: [yeah] [that's true .] 
A|60| B: [but] [some] [of] these guys [just don't] care [you [know] .] _and so_ [uh] 
B|61| M: [yeah] [that's true .] 
A|62| B: [yeah] [right] [uh-huh .] 
B|63| M: [and] [they they] [you] [don't know] [they're] [just] happy [to get out] [of] [it .] 
A|64| B: _um_ [that's] possible [i guess] . 
B|65| M: [and uh .] 
A|66| B: _um_ [so] _where_ [do] [you] _live in_ [pennsylvania] ? 
B|67| M: [um] pittsburgh . 
A|68| B: [oh] _okay [._ [i] don't think] [i] really _know [that_ .] 
B|69| M: [uh] [i [think] they're] trying [to] [start] [some] programs down [in the] elementary schools . 
A|70| B: because [uh you _know] that_ all depends [too] on _where_ [you] [are] at . [that's] [uh] sort [of] interesting [to get] opinions as [to] _where_ different parts [of the] country [are] . because [the] [more] grass root country [uh] parts [of the] country tend [to to] support capital punishment _where_ [the] places [that] [are] [you know] less [in] contact [with] crime _you know [the_ the] [more] [more] urban [i mean] less 
B|71| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| M: [and uh] [and so] _i'm_ [not] [i] don [i think] _i'm_ pretty far from [uh you know] _what_ [i] call [a] nut [and] bolts kind [of] attitude . 
A|74| B: two hours _where_ ? 
B|75| M: [uh] [i] [live in] garland . 
A|76| B: [oh] _okay ._ near polk ? 
B|77| M: [yeah .] 
A|78| B: polk institute . [it's] [uh] an old [uh] university [that] turned into [a] place [for the] mentally retarded [. uh] 
B|79| M: [oh] . 
A|80| B: [very] old [uh] historical place [there] . 
B|81| M: [oh] . 
A|82| B: sharon pennsylvania's up [there] . 
B|83| M: [yeah] [that's] [where] i've seen [it .] 
A|84| B: [yeah .] 
B|85| M: [that's] [a] nice area . 
A|86| B: [oh] _okay ._ 
B|87| M: [okay .] 
A|88| B: _in that_ [case] maybe [you [know] .] 
B|89| M: [yeah [.] [i] mean] [i] [know that] _my_ older brother [and] sister-in-law they've been [in] [a] relationship [for] [oh] probably twenty-five years 
A|90| B: [right .] [that's true [.] yeah] [well] [it] [it] [you know] [you] [get] certain circumstances [where] [you] hear [about] these [people] [that] [have] [you know] stolen kids [and you know] done terrible [things] [to] them [and] killed them [and you [know] that] sort [of] thing 
B|91| M: [uh] [well] 
A|92| B: [you] [just] [like] [i don't] want [that] [person] sharing [the] earth [with] [me] [you _know] [i_ mean] [that] [is] [just] terrible . 
B|93| M: [uh] 
A|94| B: [and [uh] you know] [we] had [a case] [like] [that] here [and] on [the] other hand [you know] [people] [are] saying [that] because [the] he knows because [the] criminals [know [that] [the] uh] penalties can [be] [very] severe [they] [uh] [there's] less criminals [that] [are] [you know] turning themselves [in] or [you know] pleading or whatever because [they] [know [that] the] judge [you know] [if they] find them [guilty] [is] [you know] has [the the] opportunity [to] sentence them [you know] [for] [for the] death sentence . 
B|95| M: [yeah .] 
A|96| B: [yeah .] [well] [i'm] [just] saying [that] [that] [that's] [what] [the the] client lawyers [are] saying . [they're] saying [that] [you know] [you [know] more] [of] [my] clients [would] [have] pleaded [guilty] [if they] [would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly _having_ [to [to] [to] get] [a] death sentence because [you can't] plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] going [to] [be] . 
B|97| M: [right .] 
A|98| B: [right] [uh-huh .] 
B|99| M: [so] [i don't know i] [i guess] [i] [just] [i] [feel [that] the] justice [system] works [in] our favor [in that] we're [not] satisfied [with] [the] [system] [and] [i think] [it's] [just] [that] [there's] [there] [is] [too] [much] [uh [you know] the] justice systems [are] working [in] our favour . 
A|100| B: [yeah] [right .] 
B|101| M:  !!!!!! ; !! remind [me] [of] [that] now . 
A|102| B: [uh-huh [.] i] [was] [just] saying [that] _way_ [what] [they're] saying [is] [that] [they can't] [get] [people] [to] turn themselves [in] [then] . [and so] _we [have_ _to] go_ through [a trial] [then] [to] [prove] [the] person's [guilty] . 
B|103| M: [uh] [i] see . 
A|104| B: [and] perhaps [we] can [and] perhaps [we] [can't] [and so] [the] guy might [get] off . 
B|105| M: [well i [think] [we] have] got [a] long [way] [to go] [. i think] [uh you know] [in the] last ten years [uh] [uh the] [only] [way] [that] we've gone down [is] [to uh] [to] [having] [a] unanimous verdict . 
A|106| B: [and uh] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are] [are] guys [that] [are] [you know] going [to get] caught anyways [but] [there's] always [a] few [of] those [people] [that] [are] [you know] lost [their] head or whatever . 
B|107| M: [right .] 
A|108| B: anyways [but [uh] [.] yeah] [we] [just] had [a] terrible [case] [in] virginia [where] [some] girl disappeared [and and] [the] guy [like] [i] said he [just] [uh] said [that] he took her [but] he won't admit [that] she died or whatever [and] he won't say [where] [the] body [is] because he knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know] mandatory life sentences [for] murder .
