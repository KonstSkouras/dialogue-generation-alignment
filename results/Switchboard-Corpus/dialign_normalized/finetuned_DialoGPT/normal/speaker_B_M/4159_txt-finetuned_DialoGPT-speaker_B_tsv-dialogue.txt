A|30| B: [and [, uh] ,] somebody _is_ _on_ the premises 
B|31| M: [yeah .] 
A|32| B: [and] one [of] the employees actually _is_ driving by with [a] forklift [and] he pushes the wrong button [and] he drops [a] load [of] lumber _on_ somebody [and] [it] injures , them . 
B|33| M: oh . oh . oh , no . 
A|34| B: [sure] . insurance should pay [for] [that] . 
B|35| M: [well ,] [that's] true , 
A|36| B: [well] [i'm not] talking about any loss [. i] was talking about only losses [that] [are] judged [for] [a] punitive damage which _is_ another category [of] , the juries [are] awarding damages these days based _on_ the person's actual injuries [and] _what_ [they] [are] due .

B|37| M: _right_ . _right_ . uh-huh . _right_ , [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [and] unfortunately the the , lately the courts have been deciding [that] those [could] be paid [for] by insurance too . 
B|39| M: _right_ . 
A|40| B: so again _, it_ never _really_ penalizes , the company doing the wrong . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] uh-uh . [well ,] [it's] [, it really] [is] . [it's] [, uh [,] it] [, it] depends [on] [what] you're , [what] [you buy] [. uh ,] 
A|42| B: [they] [can] go [right] [on] doing the same old thing [they] always used to . 
B|43| M: [yeah . yeah .] 
A|44| B: [and] [if] , [if they] [know] [some] practice [is] wrong [, you know [,] i'm not] talking about your isolated occurrences [, i'm] talking [more] about the [, you know ,] the thing [that] [they] [know ,] maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] [know] [is] hurting [people] out there [and they] continue to do [it] even after [they] become aware [of] [that] .
