A|36| B: _well _,_ we_ [like] _arby's_ . _as_ far _as_ , fast [food] goes . 
B|37| M: _oh ,_ [yes .] 
A|38| B: _oh , really ?_ _why_ ? 
B|39| M: [because] _they're_ , _they're_ terrible . 
A|40| B: [oh ,] no , no , no . someone _has_ [been] lying _to_ [you] . [what] _they_ use [is] _roast_ _beef_ .

A|42| B: [that's] _what ,_ [oh ,] [my] goodness . 
B|43| M: _and they_ said , [well _,] you know [,_ [it's] [,] it] [is] [, it [was] like] [roast] , [but it's] [not] _like , like [,_ uh ,] [beef] [, you] put [in the] rice [, and] [you] put [, uh] . 
A|44| B: [i'm] surprised [. my] dad worked _for_ _arby's_ _for_ several years . 
B|45| M: [arby's] [, i] wonder [why] . 
A|46| B: [yeah .] 
B|47| M: [oh , really ?] 
A|48| B: _well , that's_ _happened_ before . 
B|49| M: _yeah [,_ and] [it's] [happened] [a lot] .

B|51| M: [yeah .] [oh _,] that_ _sounds_ [good] . 
A|52| B: [and] stuff [like] _that ._ [and] _so ,_ [um ,]

A|54| B: [a] _health food_ ? 
B|55| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|56| B: [like , like ,] name _one_ 
B|57| M: _yeah _, i_ don't _know_ [,_ i [, i] think] [i've] seen _them_ [, uh] 
A|58| B: [i'm not sure what] [you're] talking about . 
B|59| M: _uh , i don't _know_ [,_ _i] guess_ [it's just] _like _, you know ,_ the_ [health food] [is] [just] [so] [expensive] [, _you] can't_ afford [it .] 
A|60| B: huh . 
B|61| M: [and] [it's a] very health- inspiring [restaurant .] 
A|62| B: [i don't] [guess] [i've] _ever_ [been] _to_ anything [like] [that] _so [,_ i] [really] [don't] [have] anything _to_ compare [it] _to_ . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [it] _would be_ [good] [i think ,] 
B|65| M: _yeah _, i_ don't know_ _if_ you've [ever] heard [of] _them_ [but ,] 
A|66| B: [uh , i don't know] _how_ [expensive] [they] [are .] [it] [sounds] [like] [that] [it] _would probably_ , 
B|67| M: _yeah [, i_ think that] [would be] [a] [really] [good] idea . 
A|68| B: _for_ _one_ _person_ ? 
B|69| M: _yeah ,_ [yeah .] 
A|70| B: [oh] 
B|71| M: [but , uh _,] you know [,_ i think] [we're] _going to get_ [, we're] getting ready _to get_ [a [,] a] new [one] . we've got [a ,] we've got [, a] nine month old [, and] [we're , _we] [,_ we] [get] ready [to , _to] get_ her [to] start kindergarten next year . 
A|72| B: [a] bit 
B|73| M:  !!! remind me . 
A|74| B: [yeah [, i] , i] won't [really] [be] interested [in] [going [to] ,] [in] [going] [there .] [because] [, i] feel [like] _i'm [,_ i'm] _paying_ [, you know ,] five dollars _for_ [the] [food] _probably_ [and] five dollars _for_ something _that i_ [could] [get] along quite [well] without 
B|75| M: [yeah] 
A|76| B: [yeah .] maybe , maybe _that ._ [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [and , uh] . 
A|78| B: [yeah [.] i] [could] see _that ,_ then maybe . 
B|79| M: [well] [it's [,] it's just] [a] matter [of] [how] [you] [look] [at] [it .] [you know ,] _if_ [i] _were_ [, i] [would] say [that i] [would probably] say [that] [the] people who [are] [really] committed [to] [the] cause [, uh ,] [are] _not going to_ pay any taxes [are] [not] [paying] [a] substantial amount [in] taxes . 
A|80| B: [yeah , i] [like] [the [,] the] seafood [that] _they ,_ _when_ [they] had _it [,_ you know , the] broiled , 
B|81| M: [uh] . 
A|82| B: [yeah .] [probably] _that's true ._ [but] [i] [know] [a lot] [of] [their] [, [a] lot] [of] [their] specials sometimes [are] fried things [, that] [you can't] [really] [get] away from [the] fried , 
B|83| M: [yeah] 
A|84| B: now [why] [would] [you go] [to] [a] seafood [restaurant] [to] eat chicken ? 
B|85| M: [well] [it's] [good] [, it's just] [good] [for] [you] [, it] [has] [a] [good] [, uh] 
A|86| B: [that's] [one] [of] [my] husband's pet peeves . he doesn't understand [why] somebody [would] [go] [to] [a] seafood _place_ [and] eat either chicken or steak [, you [know] .] 
B|87| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|88| B: [oh , really ?] 
B|89| M: [yeah ,] _they're_ , _they were_ [really] [, uh [,] you] [would] [have] _to be [,_ uh] . 
A|90| B: [oh ,] _catfish_ [is] wonderful . 
B|91| M: [i have] never eaten [catfish] . 
A|92| B: [oh , really] . 
B|93| M: [yeah [,] [and] i] love [that .] 
A|94| B: [really] . 
B|95| M: [and , uh [,] you know ,] they've , [they ,] [they] check [for] drugs . 
A|96| B: [why] ? 
B|97| M: [they] [have] [a place] [at] resurrection lutheran church _that will_ accept [you] [as] an alternate 
A|98| B: [oh .] huh . 
B|99| M: [and [, uh _,] [i] mean_ [,] i'm not] [a] great fisher [but] [i'm [,] i [, i] don't] [, _i] guess_ [i'm] [a] [good] [enough] [person] [to , to] [go] [and] catch fish [. i] don'm . 
A|100| B: [that's] too bad , [because] [i'm] [probably] [not going to] stop eating [it] 
B|101| M: [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|103| M: [and [i] [, i] [,] [and] [i] have] [been] very , very [, uh] ... 
A|104| B: _that's true ._ 
B|105| M: [and , uh] . 
A|106| B: [oh ,] _on_ [one] hand [i] see [that] [and] _on_ [the] other hand [, uh ,] [my] older sister remembers _when_ [, uh ,] [at] [one] point [they were] taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [i guess] , had [a] half-life [of] , [oh ,] five years [if] [they] sit empty _on_ dry land . 
B|107| M: uh-uh . uh-hum . [uh ,] [yes .] 
A|108| B: [so] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
B|109| M: [oh .] 
A|110| B: [and] then [they] take these things [that will] rust [and they] throw [them] [in the] ocean which [is] [going to] speedup [the] process [even] more . 
B|111| M:  !!! % [well , [that's] true .] 
A|112| B: [oh .] [and] then [they] wouldn't [think] . [they were] floating around [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them] . 
B|113| M: [yeah .] 
A|114| B: [and] this [is] before [i] [was] born . 
B|115| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| B: _so [,_ i mean] [we're] taking thirty years ago , this [happened] , 
B|117| M: [yeah .] 
A|118| B: [and [,] and] who's [, you know , the] tuna [is] radioactive [to] [a] certain extent . 
B|119| M: [right .] 
A|120| B: [you can't] [get] away from [it] [so] [i think [,] to] some point , 
B|121| M: [so ,] 
A|122| B: [yeah [,] you [know] .] [so] _there's_ [, you know ,] _there's_ some things [i think we] can [we [,] you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] [health] purposes [and] some things [that] [we] [just] need [to] [like , you know ,] this [is] [not] [in] [my] control . 
B|123| M: [yeah ,] [well [, i] don't [know] [.] i] don [, i [, i] think [that] [,] uh , [it's] [,] [it] , it] [just] seems [like] [it's just] [, it] seems [like] [there's] [just] [so] [much] [going] [on] [that] [it's] almost overwhelming [when] [you] [think] [of] [it .] 
A|124| B: [so] [i'm] either [going [to] be [,] i'm] either [going to] starve [to] death or [i'm] [going to get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and] eat [as] healthily [as] [i] possibly can [, you [know] .] 
B|125| M: [yeah [,] [that's] true .]
