B|3| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|4| B: _well_ _a_ little bit _for_ _the_ price 
B|5| M: _yeah ._

B|9| M: [um] . 
A|10| B: some _of_ _the_ some _of_ _the_ best _food_ _i have_ _ever_ had _was_ out _of_ _a_ outside or inside _of_ _a place_ _that_ [we] drove _up_ _and i_ _was like_ _i'm not_ eating _in_ [there] _are_ [you] nuts ? _and uh_ [we] went _in_ [and] _it was_ _the_ _it was_ _the_ most wonderful _food ._

B|19| M: [that's not] [even] [right [.] um] [i [i] think] [that's] [the worst] thing _i think we_ _could_ come [up] _with_ _. i think_ _i mean_ _i don't know_ [it] [just] _i'm not sure what_ [the] criteria _are _._ _i_ guess_ [i] _it's_ _i guess_ _it's_ [not] [just] _you know_ _i don't _know_ _._ i mean_ [i] do [i have] [not] [been] _in the_ situation _where_ [uh] . 
A|20| B: someone [in the] what's [the] name _of_ _that_ _restaurant_ ? [in the] background [where] _at_ ? . someone [in the] background [the] hari krishna .

B|29| M: [oh] okay . 
A|30| B: _so_ k [a] l [a] [i think] c h [a] n d . 
B|31| M: [right .] 
A|32| B: _that_ should _get_ [you] close _enough_ _to _to_ be_ able _to_ find [it [.] i think] [it's] [uh] _probably_ listed [in the] restaurants [you [know] .] 
B|33| M: [yeah] [it] _is_ [it's] [in the] _uh-huh_ menu . 
A|34| B: _but it's_ _uh _it's_ just_ fabulous _food ._ 
B|35| M: [oh] [i] love _their_ [food _.] [my_ husband] [really] likes [it .] 
A|36| B: _well_ [we] [like] _arby's_ . _as_ far _as_ fast [food] goes . 
B|37| M: [oh] [yes .] 
A|38| B: _oh really ?_ _why_ ? 
B|39| M: [because] _they're_ _they're_ terrible . 
A|40| B: [oh] no no no . someone _has_ [been] lying _to_ [you] . [what] _they_ use [is] _roast_ _beef_ . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [that's] [what] [oh] [my] goodness . 
B|43| M: _and they_ said [well] [you know] [it's] [it] [is] [it [was] like] [roast] [but it's] [not] _like like_ [uh] [beef] [you] put [in the] rice [and] [you] put [uh] . 
A|44| B: [i'm] surprised [. my] dad worked _for_ _arby's_ _for_ several years . 
B|45| M: [arby's] [i] wonder [why] . 
A|46| B: [yeah .] 
B|47| M: [oh really ?] 
A|48| B: _well that's_ _happened_ before . 
B|49| M: [yeah] [and] [it's] [happened] [a lot] . 
A|50| B: [but] [we] [like] _good uh_ _we're we_ [like] _mexican [food_ .] 
B|51| M: [yeah .] [oh] [that] _sounds_ [good] . 
A|52| B: [and] stuff [like] _that ._ [and] _so_ [um] 
B|53| M: [what] [what] kind [of] [mexican food] do [you] [like] ? 
A|54| B: [a] _health food_ ? 
B|55| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|56| B: [like like] name _one_ 
B|57| M: _yeah _i_ don't know_ [i [i] think] [i've] seen _them_ [uh] 
A|58| B: [i'm not sure what] [you're] talking about . 
B|59| M: _uh i don't know_ _i guess_ [it's just] _like _you know_ the_ [health food] [is] [just] [so] [expensive] _you can't_ afford [it .] 
A|60| B: huh . 
B|61| M: [and] [it's a] very health- inspiring [restaurant .] 
A|62| B: [i don't] [guess] [i've] _ever_ [been] _to_ anything [like] [that] [so] [i] [really] [don't] [have] anything _to_ compare [it] _to_ . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [it] _would be_ [good] [i think] 
B|65| M: _yeah _i_ don't know_ _if_ you've [ever] heard [of] _them_ [but] 
A|66| B: [uh i don't know] _how_ [expensive] [they] [are .] [it] [sounds] [like] [that] [it] _would probably_ 
B|67| M: _yeah [i_ think that] [would be] [a] [really] [good] idea . 
A|68| B: _for_ _one_ _person_ ? 
B|69| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|70| B: [oh] 
B|71| M: [but uh] [you know] [i think] [we're] _going to get_ [we're] getting ready _to get_ [a] [a] new [one] . we've got [a] we've got [a] nine month old [and] [we're we] [we] [get] ready [to _to] get_ her [to] start kindergarten next year . 
A|72| B: [a] bit 
B|73| M:  !!! remind me . 
A|74| B: [yeah [i] i] won't [really] [be] interested [in] [going to] [in] [going] [there .] [because] [i] feel [like] [i'm] [i'm] _paying_ [you know] five dollars _for_ [the] [food] _probably_ [and] five dollars _for_ something _that i_ [could] [get] along quite [well] without 
B|75| M: [yeah] 
A|76| B: [yeah .] maybe maybe _that ._ [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [and uh] . 
A|78| B: [yeah [.] i] [could] see [that] then maybe . 
B|79| M: [well] [it's] [it's just] [a] matter [of] [how] [you] [look] [at] [it .] [you know] _if_ [i] _were_ [i] [would] say [that i] [would probably] say [that] [the] people who [are] [really] committed [to] [the] cause [uh] [are] _not going to_ pay any taxes [are] [not] [paying] [a] substantial amount [in] taxes . 
A|80| B: [yeah i] [like] [the] [the] seafood [that] [they] _when_ [they] had [it] [you know the] broiled 
B|81| M: [uh] . 
A|82| B: [yeah .] [probably] _that's true ._ [but] [i] [know] [a lot] [of] [their] [a lot] [of] [their] specials sometimes [are] fried things [that] [you can't] [really] [get] away from [the] fried 
B|83| M: [yeah] 
A|84| B: now [why] [would] [you go] [to] [a] seafood [restaurant] [to] eat chicken ? 
B|85| M: [well] [it's] [good] [it's just] [good] [for] [you] [it] [has] [a] [good uh] 
A|86| B: [that's] [one] [of] [my] husband's pet peeves . he doesn't understand [why] somebody [would] [go] [to] [a] seafood _place_ [and] eat either chicken or steak [you [know] .] 
B|87| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|88| B: [oh really ?] 
B|89| M: [yeah] _they're_ _they were_ [really] [uh] [you] [would] [have] [to be] [uh] . 
A|90| B: [oh] _catfish_ [is] wonderful . 
B|91| M: [i have] never eaten [catfish] . 
A|92| B: [oh really] . 
B|93| M: [yeah] [and i] love [that .] 
A|94| B: [really] . 
B|95| M: [and uh] [you know] they've [they] [they] check [for] drugs . 
A|96| B: [why] ? 
B|97| M: [they] [have] [a place] [at] resurrection lutheran church _that will_ accept [you] [as] an alternate 
A|98| B: [oh .] huh . 
B|99| M: [and [uh] [i] mean] [i'm not] [a] great fisher [but] [i'm] [i [i] don't] _i guess_ [i'm] [a] [good] [enough] [person] [to to] [go] [and] catch fish [. i] don'm . 
A|100| B: [that's] too bad [because] [i'm] [probably] [not going to] stop eating [it] 
B|101| M: [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|103| M: [and [i] i] [and [i] have] [been] very very [uh] ... 
A|104| B: _that's true ._ 
B|105| M: [and uh] . 
A|106| B: [oh] _on_ [one] hand [i] see [that] [and] _on_ [the] other hand [uh] [my] older sister remembers _when_ [uh] [at] [one] point [they were] taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [i guess] had [a] half-life [of] [oh] five years [if] [they] sit empty _on_ dry land . 
B|107| M: uh-uh . uh-hum . [uh] [yes .] 
A|108| B: [so] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
B|109| M: [oh .] 
A|110| B: [and] then [they] take these things [that will] rust [and they] throw [them] [in the] ocean which [is] [going to] speedup [the] process [even] more . 
B|111| M:  !!! % [well [that's] true .] 
A|112| B: [oh .] [and] then [they] wouldn't [think] . [they were] floating around [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them] . 
B|113| M: [yeah .] 
A|114| B: [and] this [is] before [i] [was] born . 
B|115| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| B: [so] [i mean] [we're] taking thirty years ago this [happened] 
B|117| M: [yeah .] 
A|118| B: [and] [and] who's [you know the] tuna [is] radioactive [to] [a] certain extent . 
B|119| M: [right .] 
A|120| B: [you can't] [get] away from [it] [so] [i think] [to] some point 
B|121| M: [so] 
A|122| B: [yeah] [you [know] .] [so] _there's_ [you know] _there's_ some things [i think we] can [we] [you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] [health] purposes [and] some things [that] [we] [just] need [to] [like you know] this [is] [not] [in] [my] control . 
B|123| M: [yeah] [well [i] don't [know] [.] i] don [i [i] think that] [uh it's] [it it] [just] seems [like] [it's just] [it] seems [like] [there's] [just] [so] [much] [going] [on] [that] [it's] almost overwhelming [when] [you] [think] [of] [it .] 
A|124| B: [so] [i'm] either [going [to] be] [i'm] either [going to] starve [to] death or [i'm] [going to get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and] eat [as] healthily [as] [i] possibly can [you [know] .] 
B|125| M: [yeah] [that's true .]
