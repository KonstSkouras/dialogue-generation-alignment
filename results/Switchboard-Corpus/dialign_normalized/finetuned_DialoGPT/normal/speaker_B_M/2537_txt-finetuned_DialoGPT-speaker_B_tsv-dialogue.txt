A|62| B: [that's right .] 
B|63| M: [and uh] 
A|64| B: [that's right [.] i] even [had] [friends] when [i] was going to [college] [who] were [in] [uh] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally um provide medicine to their family family members [and] [friends] certain medicines were were legal [now] [i [i] i] believe [you know] [any] [of the] [any] [of the] ones we [would] we [would be] tested for wouldn't [be] _on_ those lists
