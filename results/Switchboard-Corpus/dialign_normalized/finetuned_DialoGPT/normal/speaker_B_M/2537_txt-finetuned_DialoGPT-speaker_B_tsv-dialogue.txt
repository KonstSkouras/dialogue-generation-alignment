A|62| B: [that's right .] 
B|63| M: [and , uh] 
A|64| B: [that's right [.] i] even [had] [friends] when [i] was going to [college] [who] were [in] [, [uh] ,] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally , um , provide medicine to their family family members [and] [friends] certain medicines were , were legal [now] [i , [i] , i] believe [, you know ,] [any] [of [the] ,] [any] [of the] ones we [would] , we [would be] tested for wouldn't [be] _on_ those lists , 
B|65| M: uh-uh [. right .] 
A|66| B: [but , [uh] ,] um [, there] were certain [things] [that] [they] [could] provide without [a] doctors prescription based _on_ their qualifications [and [,] that] [can] happen . 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [but , [uh] ,] 
B|69| M: [so ,] what's [your] opinion [on] [it] ?
