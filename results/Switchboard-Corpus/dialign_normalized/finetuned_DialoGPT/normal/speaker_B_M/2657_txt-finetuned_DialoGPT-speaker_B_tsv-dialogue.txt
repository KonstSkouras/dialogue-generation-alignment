B|17| M: [uh ,] uh-homing 
A|18| B: so _, you know ,_ _if_ _, i think _that's_ a_ _good_ _way_ for [people] _to _, you_ know ,_ maybe get [people] [to] come back [to] these small towns [to] work by helping [people] [that] normally might _not_ _be_ able _to go_ [to] college [and] get [the] type [of] degree _they_ _want_ . 
B|19| M: uh-uh _. yeah ._ 
A|20| B: [yeah .] as far as _yeah ,_ getting doctors [and] all [that] stuff _, [yeah_ .] 
B|21| M: _well _,_ _it_ _,_ it_ depends _on_ [the] doctor [. [i] mean] [if _you] _want_ _to_ go into_ [a] profession [, [you] _have] to be_ willing [to _go] out [and_ [,] uh] 
A|22| B: [yeah .] 
B|23| M: _but [,_ uh ,] 
A|24| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: [but] [it's] [not] [a ,] you're _right [,_ it's a] major medical problem _, but_ [it's] [something] [that] needs _to be_ addressed _, [and_ [,] uh _,] and_ [it's] _going _to_ be_ [a] big [, uh ,] 
A|26| B: [yeah .] 
B|27| M: _but ,_ 
A|28| B: [i really] _don't _know_ that_ much about [it _,] you know [, i_ [, i] [, i] think] _of _the_ peace corps _,_ you know ,_ _more_ _like_ [the] sixties [and] [that] _kind of_ stuff _when_ , 
B|29| M:  !!! % !! clamation point !! remind [me] [of] [that [.] i] used _to _do_ that_ quite [a] bit [when] [i] [was] _in [the_ peace corps ,] you're _right ._ 
A|30| B: [yeah .] [and] [don't] _they_ [go into] _other_ countries [and] stuff ? 
B|31| M:  !!!!,!! clamation !! [there] !! 
A|32| B: [uh-huh .] [things that] _make_ [the] _, [yeah_ .] _make them_ _more_ self-supporting ? 
B|33| M: [yeah _,] yeah ,_ [make them] self-starters . 
A|34| B: [yeah .] 
B|35| M: [they] , [they] , _they [have_ a] very [, uh] 
A|36| B: [right [.] yeah .] 
B|37| M: [and [,] uh [,] you know [, i] think] [, uh] . 
A|38| B: [but] [it] definitely _would_ give [a lot _of] the_ kids now [that] [have] everything given [to] [them] [that] [they] [want to] see _what_ _it's like_ [if you] _don't have_ all [the] [money] [and] _can't_ [have] _what_ [you want] [when] [you want] [it .] 
B|39| M: [yeah .] [that's true .] [that _,] [that's_ true] [, [that] [,] that] [really] [is] [true .] 
A|40| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [and , um [, [i] know] [,] um] . 
A|42| B: [yeah .] 
B|43| M: _i think _that_ [would_ be] [a] [really] [good] [thing] _to do_ . 
A|44| B: [i don't] _, i don't _know_ that_ [you] _could_ require everyone [to ,] [do that] for [, yeah [,] _to] do it_ for [a] _whole_ year , or two years or [something] _like_ [that ,] 
B|45| M: [yeah _,] [that's_ true .] 
A|46| B: _i don't _know_ that_ [that would] work [if] , somebody's , [was] , didn't [really] [want [to] be] [there] [and] didn't [have] , 
B|47| M: [yeah ,] _well _,_ [that's_ true .] 
A|48| B: [yeah [,] i mean ,] [there] [would be] loopholes _just_ _like_ [there] [is] [in] anything else 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [yeah .] 
B|51| M: [and [,] uh [,] you] [just] [don't] [want _to] go into_ [that .] 
A|52| B: [yeah .] 
B|53| M: _and that's_ [the] [way] _they're_ _going [to_ do [it] .] 
A|54| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: [and _,] and that's_ _, that's_ [one [of] the] problems . 
A|56| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [and [,] uh ,] [they] [, uh] _they're_ very , very [, uh] ... 
A|58| B: [right [,] [yeah] .] 
B|59| M: [but] _they're_ _in the_ process [of] being , 
A|60| B: [yeah ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|61| M: _they're_ [, uh] 
A|62| B: [yeah .] 
B|63| M: [and _i] mean [, i_ ,] _i'm_ _, i guess_ _i'm_ [kind of] old-fashioned too [. _i] think [that_ , uh] 
A|64| B: [yeah .] 
B|65| M: _but [,_ uh] . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [i don't [know] , i] don , _i'm_ _, i guess_ _i'm_ cynical [of the] [whole] [thing] _, [but_ i] don [think] [there] _could be_ [a] [more] permanent solution [to] [it .] 
A|68| B: [well ,] down here _with [the_ peace corps] we're talking about all these [people] [that] aren't even [in] our own country [when] [there's] enough [people] here [that i think] probably _need_ [help] [and ,] [could be] helped . 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [yeah .] 
B|71| M: _but , _i mean [,_ i_ think that's] [, i don't [know] _,] [that's_ [a] [,] [that] [,] that] [is] [a [,] a] problem [with _the] united states [._ [i] think] [it's a] big problem [. i] don t understand why _the united_ nations [, uh ,] why [they [don't] _have] more_ input [into] [it [.] [i] mean] [i [,] [it's] like , you know ,] why [not] , why , why we [don't] [want] [some] assistance . 
A|72| B: [and] maybe rather than [just] , require somebody [to] join [like] [the peace corps] for [a] year maybe [like [,] um ,] during college [, you know ,] maybe [have] [some] [kind of] course where they'd [be] required [to do] [some] [kind of] community service type work [, and] [help people] [in] [that] area or [people] [in [the] united states .] 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [there] probably _are_ [, you know ,] for [but] [i'm] sure [, that's] probably [like] [people] [that] [do that] _are_ , _are_ [the] [people] [that] _are_ [going [to] go into] social work [and] stuff [but [i think] that] [it] wouldn't [really] [be] half bad for everybody [not] [to do] [something] [, you know [,] and] realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to [,] um ,] [help] these [people] [, you know [,] and] [i'm] [not] saying [just] give _them money_ [but , i mean ,] because [they [have] to be] taught [to be] , 
B|75| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| B: [yeah] [i mean [, i] know] [that's] _what_ my father-in-law [was] talking about [, you know ,] [when] [you] give these [people] [money] or _, what_ [was] [it] [they] were bringing up points asking as far as whether _they need_ [to] give [, um ,] [more] _money to_ these [people] [, i mean [,] and that's] [not] [really] [the] answer [, i mean ,] because [if] [they're] alcoholics they'll [just] [go out and] spend [, it] [on] [, you know ,] booze or [something] [like] [that ,] 
B|77| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| B: [but] . 
B|79| M: [that [,] [that] [,] that] [is] [the] [whole] _thing [._ i [, i] don't know] . 
A|80| B: [yeah .] 
B|81| M: [you know [,] what] [if you] gave [them [money] to] clean [out] their closets [and] tell [them] [they need] [some] lube ? 
A|82| B: or [, you know [,] to] find [a] job where [they] can learn how [to] support themselves , 
B|83| M: [right .] 
A|84| B: [i mean [, i] guess] we're getting [kind of] off [the] subject , here [, but] . 
B|85| M: [yeah [.] yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah [,] i mean] [it's] , [true [.] yeah .] 
B|87| M: [it's] [not] [like] [they're] [going [to] , you] [can't] , 
A|88| B: [yeah .] 
B|89| M: [and [,] uh , i] don [, i know that] [there] [are] [a lot of] [other] organizations [that] [could] [do [it] .] 
A|90| B: flower mound [, [yeah] .] so , we're [a] little [you know ,] farther removed [from] [like] dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas where [they] probably [have more] [of the] homeless [and] [that] type [of] [thing .]
