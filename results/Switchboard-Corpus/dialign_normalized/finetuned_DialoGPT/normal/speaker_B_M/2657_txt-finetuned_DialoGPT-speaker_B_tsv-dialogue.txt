B|9| M: _yeah ._ 
A|10| B: [uh-huh .] _if_ _it's like you know_ [really] [a] [you know] [a] lower paying job [you know] where _in_ [a] small town [you] [don't] obviously [you] [don't] _need_ as much as far as _to [you_ know] [to] live .

A|20| B: [yeah .] as far as [yeah] getting doctors [and] all [that] stuff [yeah .] 
B|21| M: _well_ [it] [it] depends _on_ [the] doctor [. [i] mean] [if _you] _want_ _to_ go into_ [a] profession [you _have] to be_ willing [to _go] out and_ [uh] 
A|22| B: [yeah .] 
B|23| M: [but] [uh] 
A|24| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: [but] [it's] [not] [a] you're _right_ [it's a] major medical problem [but] [it's] [something] [that] needs _to be_ addressed [and] [uh] [and] [it's] _going _to_ be_ [a] big [uh] 
A|26| B: [yeah .] 
B|27| M: [but] 
A|28| B: [i really] _don't _know_ that_ much about [it] _you know [i_ [i] [i] think] _of _the_ peace corps_ [you know] _more_ _like_ [the] sixties [and] [that] _kind of_ stuff _when_ 
B|29| M:  !!! % !! clamation point !! remind [me] [of] [that [.] i] used _to do that_ quite [a] bit [when] [i] [was] _in [the_ peace corps] you're _right ._

A|34| B: [yeah .] 
B|35| M: [they] [they] _they [have_ a] very [uh] 
A|36| B: [right [.] yeah .] 
B|37| M: [and] [uh] [you know [i] think] [uh] . 
A|38| B: [but] [it] definitely _would_ give [a lot _of] the_ kids now [that] [have] everything given [to] [them] [that] [they] [want to] see _what_ _it's like_ [if you] _don't have_ all [the] [money] [and] _can't_ [have] _what_ [you want] [when] [you want] [it .] 
B|39| M: [yeah .] [that's true .] [that] [that's true] _that that_ [really] [is] [true .] 
A|40| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [and um [i] know] [um] . 
A|42| B: [yeah .] 
B|43| M: _i think _that_ [would_ be] [a] [really] [good] [thing] _to do_ . 
A|44| B: [i don't] _i don't _know_ that_ [you] _could_ require everyone [to do that] for [yeah] _to do it_ for [a] _whole_ year or two years or [something] _like_ [that] 
B|45| M: [yeah] [that's true .] 
A|46| B: _i don't _know_ [that_ [that] would] work [if] somebody's [was] didn't [really] [want [to] be] [there] [and] didn't [have] 
B|47| M: [yeah] _well_ [that's true .] 
A|48| B: [yeah] [i mean] [there] [would be] loopholes _just_ _like_ [there] [is] [in] anything else 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [yeah .] 
B|51| M: [and] [uh] [you] [just] [don't] [want _to] go into_ [that .] 
A|52| B: [yeah .] 
B|53| M: _and that's_ [the] [way] _they're_ _going [to_ do [it] .] 
A|54| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: [and] _and that's_ [that's] [one [of] the] problems . 
A|56| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [and] [uh] [they] [uh] _they're_ very very [uh] ... 
A|58| B: [right] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [but] _they're_ _in the_ process [of] being 
A|60| B: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|61| M: _they're_ [uh] 
A|62| B: [yeah .] 
B|63| M: [and _i] mean i_ _i'm_ _i guess_ _i'm_ [kind of] old-fashioned too [. _i] think [that_ uh] 
A|64| B: [yeah .] 
B|65| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [i don't [know] i] don _i'm_ _i guess_ _i'm_ cynical [of the] [whole] [thing] [but i] don [think] [there] _could be_ [a] [more] permanent solution [to] [it .] 
A|68| B: [well] down here _with [the_ peace corps] we're talking about all these [people] [that] aren't even [in] our own country [when] [there's] enough [people] here [that i think] probably _need_ [help] [and] [could be] helped . 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [yeah .] 
B|71| M: _but _i mean_ [i_ think that's] [i don't _know] [that's_ a] [that that] [is] [a] [a] problem [with _the] united states [._ [i] think] [it's a] big problem [. i] don t understand why _the united_ nations [uh] why [they [don't] _have] more_ input [into] [it [.] _i] mean i_ [it's like you know] why [not] why why we [don't] [want] [some] assistance . 
A|72| B: [and] maybe rather than [just] require somebody [to] join [like] [the peace corps] for [a] year maybe [like] [um] during college [you know] maybe [have] [some] [kind of] course where they'd [be] required [to do] [some] [kind of] community service type work [and] [help people] [in] [that] area or [people] [in [the] united states .] 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [there] probably _are_ [you know] for [but] [i'm] sure [that's] probably [like] [people] [that] [do that] _are_ _are_ [the] [people] [that] _are_ [going [to] go into] social work [and] stuff [but [i think] that] [it] wouldn't [really] [be] half bad for everybody [not] [to do] [something] [you know] [and] realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to] [um] [help] these [people] [you know] [and] [i'm] [not] saying [just] give _them money_ [but i mean] because [they [have] to be] taught [to be] 
B|75| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| B: [yeah] [i mean [i] [know] that's] _what_ my father-in-law [was] talking about [you know] [when] [you] give these [people] [money] or _what_ [was] [it] [they] were bringing up points asking as far as whether _they need_ [to] give [um] [more] _money to_ these [people] [i mean] [and that's] [not] [really] [the] answer [i mean] because [if] [they're] alcoholics they'll [just] [go out and] spend [it] [on] [you know] booze or [something] [like] [that] 
B|77| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| B: [but] . 
B|79| M: [that [that] that] [is] [the] [whole] _thing [._ i [i] don't know] . 
A|80| B: [yeah .] 
B|81| M: [you know] [what] [if you] gave [them [money] to] clean [out] their closets [and] tell [them] [they need] [some] lube ? 
A|82| B: or [you know] [to] find [a] job where [they] can learn how [to] support themselves 
B|83| M: [right .] 
A|84| B: [i mean [i] guess] we're getting [kind of] off [the] subject here [but] . 
B|85| M: [yeah [.] yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah] [i mean] [it's] [true [.] yeah .] 
B|87| M: [it's] [not] [like] [they're] [going [to] you] [can't] 
A|88| B: [yeah .] 
B|89| M: [and] [uh i] don [i know that] [there] [are] [a lot of] [other] organizations [that] [could] [do [it] .] 
A|90| B: flower mound [yeah .] so we're [a] little [you know] farther removed [from] [like] dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas where [they] probably [have more] [of the] homeless [and] [that] type [of] [thing .]
