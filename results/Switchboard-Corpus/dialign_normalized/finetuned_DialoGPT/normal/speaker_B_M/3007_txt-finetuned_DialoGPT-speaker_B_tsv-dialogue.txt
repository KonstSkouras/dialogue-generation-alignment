A|0| B: yes . yes . 
B|1| M: _well_ _that's_ _good_ . 
A|2| B: yes [well] _they were_ _they_ _really_ wanted something teeny tiny _and_ _i_ _uh_ _really_ wanted _that_ retriever's disposition . _uh_ the ultimate _to_ tolerant trainable disposition 
B|3| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|4| B: so _i_ called four or five dog trainers _because_ _i don't_ like the _little_ _dogs_ . 
B|5| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| B: _and_ _and_ _i_ asked them _you know_ _these_ _are_ the ages _of_ the kids what _do_ _i_ get . _and they_ _all_ said _golden retriever_ _and_ _i_ said _okay_ put _it_ under twenty pounds . _and_ the only thing _that_ _they_ could come up with _was_ _a_ bichon frize which _is a_ 
B|7| M: [uh] _yeah ._ 
A|8| B: _do_ _you know_ what _that is_ ? 
B|9| M: _no_ . 
A|10| B: _they're_ _cute ._ _they_ _look_ like an air headed let _me_ tell _you_ . _they're_ calm _they're_ _not_ yuppie _they're_ trainable _they're_ [uh] very personable _in a_ different way _that_ _a_ _golden retriever_ _is_ . _they're_ _not_ dignified like _a_ _retriever_ _can_ _be ._ 
B|11| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| B: [yeah .] so _how old_ _is_ your _retriever_ ? 
B|13| M: _she's_ _about_ eleven weeks _now_ _but_ _she's_ _still_ [a] [little] puppy . 
A|14| B: [well] actually _you know_ [that's] the _breed_ standard _for_ females . what _you_ 
B|15| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remindme !! _and they're_ [a] _purebred_ ? 
A|16| B: [yeah] what _you_ see shown [and] bred [now] as _golden_ retrievers this _you know_ plus eighty _to_ [a] hundred pound range . 
B|17| M: _oh_ . 
A|18| B: _that is not_ _breed_ standard . 
B|19| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] _. [that_ is not] _a _breed_ ._ 
A|20| B: fifty-five [is] the minimum [but] _they_ usually run [about] sixty _to_ sixty-five . [and] the ones [that] _are_ shown _they_ _are_ inside [that] weight allowance . 
B|21| M: _oh yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _you_ cannot show your _retriever_ _if_ _it's_ _you know_ [a] hundred plus pounds . 
B|23| M: _right_ . 
A|24| B: so _don't_ say [she's] small just say [she's] perfect . 
B|25| M: [yeah] _well i_ think [she's] real [cute .] 
A|26| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|27| M: _and uh_ she has [a] dark nose blackened nose _and uh_ 
A|28| B: yep . 
B|29| M: [but] [she's] she [is a] _good_ example [for] young _people_ [to] [look] [for] too . [because] [you know] _if you_ want _to be_ [a] _good_ [a] _good_ parent [you] [can] _always_ learn _to be ._ 
A|30| B: [well] _they_ _are_ _they_ _are_ the ultimate dog [to] have around kids so long as your kid [is not] scared _of_ [a] big dog [because] [i] had [a] _retriever_ actually [i] had [a] _retriever_ irish setter cross . which [is a] _really_ nice animal 
B|31| M: _oh yeah ._ 
A|32| B: [and] fortunately _it was_ just like [a] _retriever_ [and] then i've had [a] _retriever ._ 
B|33| M: _oh yeah ._ 
A|34| B: _it was_ gorgeous . _it was_ just gorgeous . [i] mean just gorgeous . um _and they_ both [you know] both the half [breed] [and] the pure [breed] had the [uh] what [i] consider the the the perfect disposition . [but] [you know] what [you know] what scares [me] [about] _golden_ retrievers ? since they've become so popular [you] get what [i] call backyard breeders . which [is] probably where yours came from . [people] [that] _don't know_ what [they're] doing _and they_ [breed] them [you know] [for] [a] certain characteristic . [and] _in_ the retrievers _it_ happens [to be] _they_ like them big [for] somehow big [is] perceived as the better . [and] when [you] start doing [that] [you] _really_ tamper with [you know] the _all_ the the years _of_ [uh] culling litters [and] [and uh] [you] tamper with what the dog innately [is] . 
B|35| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hauhuh uh-hue . 
A|36| B: we when [i] _was_ when [i] bought my last [purebred] _retriever_ [i] mean [i] looked _all_ over [because] [i] wanted one [that] [still] looked like [a] _retriever_ [you know] the short [to] the ground stocky _golden_ [uh] trainable tractable quiet animal [that] could hunt [and] [still] [be] _in_ the house . 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [and] [i] ended up getting one [that] [uh] came out _of_ [a] [a] [a] hunting stock [because] [i] wanted one [that] could [still] perform like [a] _retriever_ did . 
B|39| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| B: [and] i've seen an awful lot _of_ lately _really_ dumb dumb retrievers [and] i'm [and] [i] _really_ fear [for] the [breed] [because] [i] love [that] [breed] 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [but] [i] _really_ figure [right] when _it_ becomes _really_ popular [that] _it's_ going [to be] ruined . 
B|43| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|44| B: [oh yeah .] [you] bet [you] . [you] bet [you] . [you know] _how_ _they_ came up with the _retriever_ _don't_ [you] the _golden_ ? 
B|45| M: [uh] [yeah] _and it's_ [it's] [a] [purebred] [golden [retriever] .] 
A|46| B: _it was_ bred out _of_ several different retrievers _and they_ bred _it_ [for] companionship [and uh] [uh] disposition [and] [and] ability [to] hunt . _it was_ kept only by kings . 
B|47| M: [uh-huh .] [oh] [that's] interesting . 
A|48| B: [but] _they_ selectively culled those litters [i] mean [for] many hundreds _of_ years [and] since _it_ slept _in_ the castle with its master [i] mean _it_ had _it_ had [to be] _of_ [a] disposition [to] make _it_ [you know] an animal [you] could keep around [that] closely . [but] _they_ would go through _all_ the litters [and] destroy the puppies [if] _they were_ anything other than perfect . [now] [you know] [that] seems like [a] cruel thing [to] _do_ . 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: on the other hand [you] sure [you know] _they_ sure created [a] [a] wonderful [breed] [i] mean [a] wonderful [breed .] 
B|51| M: [well] [it's] [it] [it was] [it] certainly [was] [uh] 
A|52| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| M: [and [they] were] [all] purebreds . 
A|54| B: [well i] tell [you] [you know] the the german shepherd [is] the classic case _of_ what i'm talking [about] [because] _in_ america [that's] called [a] rin tin tin phenomena . 
B|55| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] _of that_ . 
A|56| B: only _in_ america [is] there [a] dog called [a] german shepherd . 
B|57| M: [yeah .] 
A|58| B: [that] dog [is] bred out [of] three european _dogs_ . the belgian tervurien [a] german skutzhund [and] [a] makes [a] [i] [always] forget the third one . [i] [can] see [it] . [uh] [uh] [but] the third one [is a] children's dog . 
B|59| M: [okay] . 
A|60| B: [and] there _are_ distinct breeds _in_ europe . [now] what happened over here [was] [is] [that] [people] saw the the first um which would actually have been [a] skutzhund which [is] what rin tin tin [was] . 
B|61| M: huh . 
A|62| B: [and] everybody wanted rin tin tin . [and] [it was] known as [a] german shepherd here . so [they] created [a breed] standard . the american kennel club did . 
B|63| M: huh . 
A|64| B: [that] said anything [that [is] a] skutzhund [a] [a] tervurien [and uh] alsatian [that's] the other one . alsatian any inner breeding [of that] [can] [be] called [a] german shepherd here . 
B|65| M: huh . 
A|66| B: [and] what happened [is] [is] [that] [people] wanted this shepherd [to] shepherd [and] protect . [and they] bred [a] dog [that] [i] [it's] called [a] an animal's critical span which basically translates [to] _how_ much shit will [it] take before [it] bites [you] [. that] german shepherd the american german shepherd here [was] [a] [a] [a] such an unreliable animal [that] the american seeing eye institute refused [to] use them [because] [they] would turn on on their handlers . 
B|67| M:  !!! % !! translated !! ; !! translate !! translation !! [you] can't [do] [that] [in a] school . 
A|68| B: [and] even um [uh] police corps which started [you know] finding other breeds [to] use [because] this thing this this thing known as [a] german shepherd here its personality [and] its dependability [and] its reliability [was] just terrible . so [about] fifteen years ago the german shepherd club [of] america decided amongst themselves [that] [they were] going [to] change this . so [they] went back [to] europe [and] brought back some [good] examples [of] each [of] the three breeds [and] bred [to] [a] standard what [they] wanted an american german shepherd [to be .] which [is a] very heavily [now] skutzhund [and] alsatian 
B|69| M: [uh] [how old] [are] [these] [dogs] ? 
A|70| B: [and it's] the alsatian [that's] the kid's dog . [it's] just [you] see them [in] europe [and they're] just lovely . 
B|71| M: [well [i] [don't] know] [uh] . 
A|72| B: [but] you'll see [i] mean [if you] ever start looking [in] papers [now] [and] [you] start seeing [these] ads [for] german shepherds [they] will say on them bred [for] disposition [a] k c conforming which means [that] their advertising [that] this [is] [no] longer an indiscriminate dog . 
B|73| M: [uh] . 
A|74| B: this [is] bred [for] [and they] had [to] go through [and] destroy [a] [for] [a] while there [about] seventy-five percent [of] their puppies [that] [they] bred . 
B|75| M:  !!!!!! ; !! % !! remind [me] . 
A|76| B: [because] [they were] looking [for] this disposition . [and] nowadays [you] you'll get you'll get [a] dog trainer [to] recommend [a] specific [you know] breeder handler . [they] will recommend their shepherds as [a] children's dog . 
B|77| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|78| B: [but] ...
