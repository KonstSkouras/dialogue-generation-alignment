B|1| M: _well_ _that's_ true . _i_ mean it's [it] [it] is [it] [would] [be] [a] _big_ problem _i_ mean _there are_ [a] lot _of_ [a] lot [a] large number _of_ guns out _there_ . 
A|2| B: yeah [it] _uh_ moving _to_ this area [of] course [it] happens everywhere _but_ _uh i_ guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns _uh_ in _the_ midwest _and_ then _uh_ moving _to_ [a] larger city where [there are] drive-by shootings _and uh_ [there] seems like killing for no reason at all _and uh_ . 
B|3| M: uh-huh . 
A|4| B: _i _i_ think_ so _and and_ there's always _the_ _uh_ _the_ _uh_ _the_ old _uh_ saying _that_ keeps coming up _that_ if [a] person wants [a] _gun_ bad enough they'll they'll _get_ _one_ _and uh_ _and_ then _uh_ . 
B|5| M: uh-huh . 
A|6| B: yeah .

A|8| B: yeah . 
B|9| M: [and] [i think] _that's_ _that's_ [one] _of the_ problems [that] [the] police [have] identified as being [the] ones who [are] really out [to] [get] [the] guns . 
A|10| B: yeah yeah [that's] for sure . 
B|11| M: [but] [i] don't _know_ . [i] don [i] donno [i think] [it] [would] [be] [a] good idea . [i i] _you_ you've got [to have] [the] _people_ who [are] who [are] legitimate [and and] legitimate [uh] [right] _to uh [to_ have] them _you_ got _to [be_ able to] prove [that] you're [a] legitimate owner [and uh] 
A|12| B: yeah [and uh] [and] [you] [know] [uh i] suppose [uh] years ago way back when [uh] when [uh] they had [the] revolutionary war [and] [people] decided [that] they [uh] were fed up with [the] government [uh] [and] if they didn't [have] [a] way [to uh to] fight back they [would] [have] been in [big] trouble . 
B|13| M: uh-huh . 
A|14| B: [well] [the] way things [are] going . 
B|15| M: [and uh] 
A|16| B: [well] [you] [know] they introduced some [gun] control back when [i] was [a] teenager [i] believe in terms [of] [uh] every [gun] [you] bought had [to be] licensed [i] believe . 
B|17| M: uh-huh . 
A|18| B: [and uh] [you] [know] [that] didn't bother me [uh] too much [and] so [i] guess [it] depends um if [there are] some statistics [that] show [that] [uh] [that] [people] [uh] commit crimes on [the] spur [of the] moment .
