B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: _what_ [about] your _home_ ? 
B|55| M: [well] [it's [it] uh] 
A|56| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: _it's _it's_ [uh_ it's] [an] older [home] [and] _it's not_ [it] [it] used [to] [be] _a little_ [more] _expensive_ [but] [we] we're [still] [we] [still] [have] [about] [a [hundred] square feet] [and it is] [still] pretty _much_ [an] [old] [house] . 
A|58| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| M: [and] _it's [uh_ it's] got [uh] [uh] [uh] [a] den [on the] side [and [uh] it's] completely brick [and] [it's] [the] _only_ thing [that] [we] [don't] [like] [about [it] is] [the] privacy [of the] den . 
A|60| B: nor _do_ [we] [but] 
B|61| M: [but uh] [we] we've got [two] [bedrooms [and] uh] .

A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] _that house_ . 
A|66| B: [right .] 
B|67| M: [and and] [they were] all _the same_ 
A|68| B: [well] [the] housing [here] in maryland [is just] atrocious . [and] in in [the] entire d c _area ._ i'm i'm [only] [about] [uh] twelve miles or [so] _from the_ [uh] border [of] washington d c [and] montgomery county maryland [is] probably one [of the] most [expensive] places [to] 
B|69| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|70| B: no [we] are west . 
B|71| M:  !!!!!! etwork !! % !! eting !! ety !! okay [you] sound [like] you're [from the] _east_ . 
A|72| B: sevren [is] [east] near [the] eastern shore 
B|73| M: okay [yeah .] 
A|74| B: _if i had_ 
B|75| M: [if i had] [a] boat [what] [would] [i] [do] _with_ [it] ? 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [and [uh] [it's] _it] was [very_ very] [expensive] . 
A|78| B: [oh] _that's not_ unusual [yeah .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's [it's_ a] nice [area .] 
A|80| B: _well that's_ [that] [area] over [there] [is] [not] as [expensive] as in [the] [the] immediate [you] [know] washington [area .] 
B|81| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|82| B: [and] [so] [we] [uh i] [was] [just] looking [for] example [there] [is] [a] [uh] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex [where i] live [and] [i] [was] over [there] recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] [two] bedroom condominium . [and] ninety-two thousand dollars [for a] [two] bedroom which [is] essentially [a] [two] bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: [oh] [yeah] [that] [is] pretty [expensive] . 
A|84| B: now [it was very] nicely [done] . 
B|85| M: [well] [it sounds like] you're you're [very very] [well] versed [on the] subject . 
A|86| B: [i] [would have] thought 
B|87| M: [it was] [it's] beautiful . 
A|88| B: [yes [.] [i] i] [can't] [i] [can't] envision spending [that] [much] _money_ [and] [on] [on] something along those lines . 
B|89| M: [well that's] true . 
A|90| B: [so] [you] [know] [it's] [i guess you] pay [the] piper [but] plus [the] [the] [the] taxes around [here] are phenomenally high . 
B|91| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|92| B: [uh] [for] [the] [and] [so] [you] [on] [that] [it's not] unusual [for] example [for] somewhere around [here] [on] [a] [on] [a] [on] [a] [what] [we] [would] [you] [know] [what] [you] described as your [house] [and] [what] [i] [would] describe as my [house] say [for] example in pensacola florida [on] [that house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] [so] forth [and] [so] [on] might pay three or four [hundred] dollars [a] year taxes . maybe [you] [know] maybe [a little] bit higher than [that] now 
B|93| M: [right] [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|94| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] [here] you'd pay almost six thousand dollars [a] year taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: wow [that's not] bad . 
A|96| B: [so] [it's uh] [so] [the] question [of] whether [to] buy [here] or move [to] another county say drive twenty [more] miles north buy [a] condominium [for] approximately [uh] [the same] price maybe [a little] lower [but] [the] taxes _would be_ [you] [know] perhaps maybe one-third [uh] [of] 
B|97| M: [yeah] [that] [would be] [a a good] way [to] [uh] 
A|98| B: [oh] absolutely . [yeah] 
B|99| M: [oh] . 
A|100| B: [so] [it's it's] _really_ sad 
B|101| M: [yeah] [it is] [it] [really [is] .] 
A|102| B: this [is] one this [is] one [of the] most highly taxed areas in [the] country . 
B|103| M: [yeah] [i i] [know] . 
A|104| B: [well] [they] [it] [the] their [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good] such things as extremely [good] school systems [for] example . [it has] one [of the] best school systems in [the] country . 
B|105| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|106| B: [uh] [and] because [the cost of living] around [here is] [so] high 
B|107| M:  !!! remind me . 
A|108| B: public employees [make] great salaries around [here] 
B|109| M: [oh] [i i] agree . 
A|110| B: [i] [was] reading [just] recently [where] [the] typical administrator in [the] montgomery county public schools makes [and] i'm [not] this [is] [uh] [the] figure he makes eighty thousand dollars [a] year . 
B|111| M: [oh] okay . 
A|112| B: [that's] 
B|113| M: [that] doesn't sound [like] [a lot of] [money] . 
A|114| B: [and] [i] by administrator [i i think] [i mean i] [they] didn't [they] did [not] define [it] [but] [for] example [a] curriculum supervisor or principal or someone [you] [know] in [that] [uh] in [that] range .
