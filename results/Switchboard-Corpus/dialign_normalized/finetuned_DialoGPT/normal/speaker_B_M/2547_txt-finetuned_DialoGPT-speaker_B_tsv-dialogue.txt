B|57| M: _it's _, it's_ , uh_ [it's] [an] older [home] [and] _it's _not_ [,_ it [,] it] used [to] [be] _a little_ [more] _expensive [,_ but] _we ,_ we're [still] [, we] [still] [have] [about] [a [hundred] square feet] [and it is] [still] pretty _much_ [an] [old] [house] . 
A|58| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| M: [and] _it's [, uh ,_ it's] got [, uh] [uh [,] uh] [a] den [, [on] the] side [and , uh] [it's] completely brick [, and] [it's] [the] _only_ thing [that] [we] [don't] [like] [about [it] is] [the] privacy [of the] den . 
A|60| B: nor _do_ [we [,] _but] ,_ 
B|61| M: [but , uh _,] we ,_ we've got [two] [bedrooms [and] , uh] .

B|63| M: [so [,] uh] . 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] _that house_ . 
A|66| B: [right .] 
B|67| M: [and , and] [they were] all _the same_ , 
A|68| B: [well ,] [the] housing [here] in maryland [is just] atrocious . [and] in , in [the] entire d c _area ._ i'm , i'm [only] [about] [, uh ,] twelve miles or [so] _from the_ [, uh ,] border [of] washington d c [, and] montgomery county , maryland [is] probably one [of the] most [expensive ,] places _to ,_ 
B|69| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|70| B: no [, we] are west . 
B|71| M:  !!!!,!! etwork !! % !! eting !! ety !! okay [, you] sound [like] you're [from the] _east_ . 
A|72| B: sevren [is] [east] , near [the] eastern shore , 
B|73| M: okay _, yeah ._ 
A|74| B: _if i had_ , 
B|75| M: [if i had] [a] boat _, what_ [would] [i] [do] _with_ [it] ? 
A|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [and [, uh [,] it's] _, it] was [very_ , very] [expensive] . 
A|78| B: [oh _,] that's not_ unusual [, yeah .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's [, it's_ a] nice [area .] 
A|80| B: _well , [that's_ [,] that] [area] over [there] [is] [not] as [expensive] as in [the] , [the] immediate [, you] [know ,] washington [area .] 
B|81| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|82| B: [and] [so [,] we [,] [uh ,] i] [was] [just] looking , [for] example [there] [is] _a [,_ uh ,] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex [where i] live [, and] [i] [was] over [there] recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] [two] bedroom condominium . [and] ninety-two thousand dollars [for a] [two] bedroom , which [is] essentially [a] [two] bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: [oh [,] _yeah] [,_ that] [is] pretty [expensive] . 
A|84| B: now [, it was very] nicely [done] . 
B|85| M: [well [,] it sounds like] you're , you're [very , very] [well] versed [on the] subject . 
A|86| B: [i] [would have] thought , 
B|87| M: [it was [,] it's] beautiful . 
A|88| B: [yes [.] [i] , i] [can't] [, i] [can't] envision spending [that] [much] _money_ [, and] [on] [, on] something along those lines . 
B|89| M: [well , that's] true . 
A|90| B: [so [,] you] [know [,] it's [,] i guess] [you] pay [the] piper [but ,] plus [the] , [the] , [the] taxes around [here] are phenomenally , high . 
B|91| M: _yeah [,_ yeah .] 
A|92| B: [uh ,] [for] [the] [, and] [so [,] you] [, on] [that] [it's not] unusual , [for] example , [for] somewhere around [here] [on] _a [,_ on] _a [,_ on] _a [,_ what] [we] [would] [, you] [know [,] what] [you] described as your [house] [and] [what] [i] [would] describe as my [house] say , [for] example , in pensacola , florida [, on] [that house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] [so] forth [and] [so] [on] , might pay three or four [hundred] dollars [a] year taxes . maybe [, you] [know ,] maybe [a little] bit higher than [that] now , 
B|93| M: [right] [, _yeah] [,_ that's] true . 
A|94| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] [here] , you'd pay almost six thousand dollars [a] year , taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: wow [, that's not] bad . 
A|96| B: [so [,] [it's , uh] ,] [so ,] [the] question [of] whether [to] buy [here] or move [to] another county , say , drive twenty [more] miles north , buy [a] condominium [for] approximately [, uh ,] [the same] price , maybe [a little] lower [, but] [the] taxes _would be_ [, you] [know ,] perhaps , maybe one-third [uh ,] [of] , 
B|97| M: _yeah [,_ that] [would be] [a , a good] way [to [,] uh] 
A|98| B: [oh ,] absolutely . [yeah ,] 
B|99| M: [oh] . 
A|100| B: [so [,] [it's ,] it's] _really_ sad 
B|101| M: [yeah [,] it is [,] it] [really [is] .] 
A|102| B: this [is] one , this [is] one [of the] most highly taxed areas in [the] country . 
B|103| M: [yeah [,] i , i] [know] . 
A|104| B: [well ,] [they] [it ,] [the] , their , [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good] , such things as extremely [good] school systems , [for] example . [it has] one [of the] best school systems in [the] country . 
B|105| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|106| B: [uh [,] and] because [the cost of living] around [here is] [so] high , 
B|107| M:  !!! remind me . 
A|108| B: public employees [make] great salaries around [here] 
B|109| M: [oh [,] i , i] agree . 
A|110| B: [i] [was] reading [just] recently [where] [the] typical administrator in [the] , montgomery county public schools makes [, and] i'm [not ,] this [is [,] uh ,] [the] figure , he makes eighty thousand dollars [a] year . 
B|111| M: [oh ,] okay . 
A|112| B: [that's ,] 
B|113| M: [that] doesn't sound [like] [a lot of] [money] . 
A|114| B: [and] [i ,] by administrator [i , i think] [i mean , i ,] [they] didn't , [they] did [not] define [it [,] but] [for] example [, a] curriculum supervisor or principal or someone [, you] [know ,] in [that] [, uh ,] in [that] range .
