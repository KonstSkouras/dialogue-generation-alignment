A|2| B: _uh_ where [i] _live_ now _it's [it's_ not] _so_ _bad_ _. _i mean_ i_ can basically leave my front door unlocked _and_ [not] _have to_ worry _about _it_ ._ _uh_ _but i_ _do_ [have] friends [that] _live _in_ the_ city _and _i think_ _that_ they_ _get _a_ lot of_ fallout _from_ _this_ war _on_ drug _thing_ . _uh_ [just] _because_ there _are_ _like_ crack houses _you know_ _on_ their street _and stuff like_ _this_ . 
B|3| M: _yeah ._ 
A|4| B: [i] _live_ out _in the_ country [yeah .]

B|7| M: _oh_ _that's a_ pretty small town . 
A|8| B: uh-huh . 
B|9| M: [and] [so] [i] [have to] drive [about] twenty [miles] each way . 
A|10| B: _um ._ 
B|11| M: [and] _we_ [have] [a] couple [of] areas [that] [are] really really [bad] areas . 
A|12| B: _um ._ 
B|13| M: [it's it's] [uh] [it] [it] has [a lot of] different problems [. i mean] [you] [have to] [you know] _you're_ [not] sure [you] _don't_ [know] _who_ _you're going to_ come up against 
A|14| B: uh-huh . 
B|15| M: [so] [it's] [uh] . 
A|16| B: uh-huh . 
B|17| M: [but _i] i_ [you] [have to] wonder [about] [the] [uh] ... 
A|18| B: wow . [that's] huge . 
B|19| M: [yeah .] 
A|20| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|21| M: [so] [uh] [it's] [a] _real_ problem . 
A|22| B: [are] there [are] there any theories _on_ why _this_ [is] happening ? 
B|23| M: _well_ [the] [the] _one_ theory [i] [have] [is] [that] [uh] [it's not] [uh] _the crime_ [is] [not] _going to_ go down as much as [it] used [to] _and that that's_ _one_ theory [but] [uh] . 
A|24| B: uh-huh . 
B|25| M: [i] _don't_ [know] . 
A|26| B: [but] why ? why [is] [it] happening ? 
B|27| M: [i] _don't_ [know] . 
A|28| B: uh-huh . 
B|29| M: [and] [uh] [so] [it's] [it] [it] keeps [the] family budget [from] [uh] [uh] [you know] [it] _makes_ [it] [uh] easier [to] [uh] 
A|30| B: uh-huh . 
B|31| M: [and] [uh] [you know] [it's] [it] [is] [a] _big_ problem [. _i] i_ _don't_ [know] _what_ [the] solution [is] _. i think_ _we_ [have to] [do] _something_ [. i] don tought [about] [this] at all . 
A|32| B: [so] _they're_ professionals ? 
B|33| M: yes . 
A|34| B: _um ._ 
B|35| M: [they're] [not] [uh] 
A|36| B: uh-huh . 
B|37| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|38| B: uh-huh . 
B|39| M: [and] [uh] 
A|40| B: _um ._ 
B|41| M: _i i_ _don't_ [know] _i think _that's_ _a_ little_ far fetched [but [i] think] [it] _would be a_ great idea . 
A|42| B: [well] _what do you_ [think] can [be] done [to] reduce [that] sort [of] [crime] ? 
B|43| M: [well] _i think i _think_ the_ [thing] [is] [is] [that] [that] [uh] [you] _see_ [you] [you] say [well] [i] _don't_ [know] . [what do you] [do] [about] [uh] 
A|44| B: uh-huh . uh-huh _. right ._ 
B|45| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|46| B: [but [i] mean] [that's] [going to] tend [to] [i mean] _it seems to me that_ sort [of] approach will tend [to] simply make [the] cost [of] committing [the crime] slightly higher _in_ other words you've increased [the] probability [of] somebody being caught [a little] bit . [the] [real] question [is] how [do you] convince [people] [not] [to] commit such _crimes_ _in the_ first _place_ . 
B|47| M: [right .] 
A|48| B: [right .] [they're] doing [that] _in_ _our_ state too . 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: _so you_ _think that_ [would be a] deterrent ? 
B|51| M: [i] _don't_ [know] . 
A|52| B: uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [i mean i] _don't_ [know] [. _i] i_ guess [i'm] kind [of] uh-hating [on] [it .] 
A|54| B: [well] [what] [about] an innocent _person who_ happens _to _have_ been_ found guilty ? 
B|55| M: [well] then then [they] [have] [the] [right] [to] [know] [that they] [have been] 
A|56| B: [right .] 
B|57| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|58| B: [so] you'd you'd rather [see] [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
B|59| M: [yeah .] 
A|60| B: uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|62| B: uh-huh . huh . 
B|63| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|64| B: [right .] 
B|65| M: [because] [it's] [a] capital [crime] . 
A|66| B: [oh] wow . [oh] my goodness . 
B|67| M: [and] [uh] [it] was [it's] [it] really was [a] very violent [and] [uh] [it] was very violent . 
A|68| B: uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [but] [it] was really [a] tough _time_ _. i think_ _we_ all came up _with_ _with_ [a] good start [but] [uh] . 
A|70| B: uh-huh _. right ._ wow . 
B|71| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|72| B: _did_ [you] _did_ [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
B|73| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|74| B: _did_ [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
B|75| M: [uh] [i] [did] [i] [just] got [a] letter [from] _them_ saying [uh] [that] [they're] [going to] start paying attorneys [and i] [just] signed up _for_ [it .] 
A|76| B: [well] [you] _could_ probably sue him [for] mental anguish _or_ [something] [right] [and] try _to get_ _money_ [from] him 
B|77| M: [yeah .] 
A|78| B: [and] 
B|79| M: [oh] [that's] good . 
A|80| B: [yeah .] [makes] [you] wish [that] _had_ [uh] still _had_ indentured servitude [for] [this] sort [of] [thing] . 
B|81| M: [that's] [right .] 
A|82| B: [but] [they] give [the] guy [a] job _in_ prison [and] make him _pay_ _his_ damn debt . 
B|83| M: [that's] [right .] 
A|84| B: [yeah] [that's] too [bad] . 
B|85| M: [but] [um] [i] guess [you know] _i i_ _don't_ [know] maybe [it's] [because] [i'm] [not] [a] great athlete [i think] [i'm] average at [this] point [but] [um .] 
A|86| B: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|87| M: [and] they've got [the] [money] [to] [pay] [for] [it] [but] [you] _you're_ [right] [it's] [it] costs [so] much [you] can't afford [it .] 
A|88| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|89| M: [i] [i'm] [not] sure [that] [uh] 
A|90| B: [yeah] [i [i] think that's] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|91| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|92| B: [that's] awful 
B|93| M: [yeah] [it] [is] [it's] really [i mean] [i'm] _i know_ [it's] [a] _big_ problem [but] [uh] . 
A|94| B: gives [you] sympathy [for] [the] vigilantes . 
B|95| M: [right .] 
A|96| B: [yeah .] 
B|97| M: [it's not] [like] he's [going to] go into [a] neighborhood [and] [do] [something] _with_ [his] kids [or] whatever . 
A|98| B: uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [but] [uh] [you know] [it's] [it] [it seems to me that] [uh] [uh] [they're] _trying to_ [do] [a] [a] good [thing] _here_ by [uh] putting [the] [uh] [the] [the] [a] [the] authorities [in] charge . 
A|100| B: [oh] my god . 
B|101| M: [and] then [the] [person who] broke [the] law gets [the] [money] anyway . 
A|102| B: [right .] 
B|103| M: [and] [it's it's] really [a] [it] [it] really [is] [a] problem . 
A|104| B: [right .] 
B|105| M: [but [i] i] [uh] . 
A|106| B: uh-huh . 
B|107| M: [and] _we're_ [going to] _protect_ [our] citizens 
A|108| B: [right .] 
B|109| M: [but] _if you_ catch yourself short [on] cash [and] [you] need [it] _you're going [to_ [have] to] use [it .] 
A|110| B: uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [and] then [uh] _we_ [have] [a] dog [and] she [uh] she does everything [just] fine . 
A|112| B: [and that [that's] a] deterrent too . [if you] [think the] home owner might [be] armed [right] [and] awake 
B|113| M: [uh] . 
A|114| B: [here] [you] break [in] [and] [you're going _to] get_ shot . 
B|115| M: [right .] 
A|116| B: uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [but] [uh] [i think [that] that's] _one of the_ worst _things_ [that's] happened [to me] . i've [been] [in] i've served [on] [a] jury before [but i] never actually [had] [the] opportunity [to] serve [on] _one_ . 
A|118| B: uh-huh . 
B|119| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|120| B: huh . 
B|121| M: [so] [it's] [a] [real] problem . 
A|122| B: wow 
B|123| M: [so] [uh] [that's] [uh] [that's] [about it] [you] [see] [a lot _of] the_ [crimes] [that] [are] committed [uh] [you know] [in the] [in the] cities [are] [the] same as [uh] [the] [crimes] [of] passion [and stuff like] [that] . 
A|124| B: uh-huh . 
B|125| M: [and] [they're] all 
A|126| B: uh-huh . 
B|127| M: [and] [uh] [so you] [have to] [be] pretty selective [in] your area [to [get] a] good newspaper . 
A|128| B: [yeah .] 
B|129| M: [and i think] [they] ought [to get] [on] _with_ [a] _a uh_ [a] more thorough trial before [they] settle [the] case . 
A|130| B: [yeah .] uh-huh [. [i mean] [i] i] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. i think] [uh] [what] [i] [would] [like] [to] [see] [is] number [one] completely getting rid [of] these victimless [crimes] . [uh] there's no reason [to] enforce those [and] spend [time] [and] [money] doing [it] [and] [and] worry [about] these [things] where [people] [are] getting hurt . 
B|131| M: uh-uh [. right .] 
A|132| B: [and i think] [one of the] [big] [things] [that] [you] can [do] [is] [to] increase deterrence [is] [uh] [if] someone [is] found guilty [of] [a uh] felony level offense [they] lose their citizenship . [and] [they] lose their constitutional rights . [you know] 
B|133| M: [right] exactly . 
A|134| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] [things] [that] [we're] [trying to] worry [about] [you know] protecting these [people] [from] [we] [just] [don't] [protect] [them] . 
B|135| M: [uh] _i know_ [i] [don't] _think i_ [could] [live in] [a] [place] [like] [that] . 
A|136| B: [i know] [and [i think] [i think] that's] ridiculous . 
B|137| M: [and i] [don't] [think the] courts work .
