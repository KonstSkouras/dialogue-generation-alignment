B|3| M: _so_ , 
A|4| B: _oh_ . right . over here , [they] _, uh ,_ [have] several private companies _that_ you can take _, uh ,_ recycled , materials _to_ . _but , uh ,_ if you want _to_ take them all _to_ [one] place , [they have] _, uh ,_ [the] first saturday _of_ every month , [they have] certain places _that_ you can drop them off . _that's_ what _i_ _do_ . _uh _,_ _and_ _i_ , i_ recycle aluminum , glass _, uh ,_ newspapers .
