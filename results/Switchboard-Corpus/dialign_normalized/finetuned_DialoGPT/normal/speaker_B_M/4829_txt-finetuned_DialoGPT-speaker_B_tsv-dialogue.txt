A|0| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|1| M: _and _they_ have_ _one_ for _the_ homeless _and_ _one_ for _uh_ for _the_ regular people . 
A|2| B: right . 
B|3| M: _so_ 
A|4| B: _oh_ . right . over here [they] [uh] [have] several private companies _that_ you can take [uh] recycled materials _to_ . _but uh_ if you want _to_ take them all _to_ [one] place [they have] [uh] [the] first saturday _of_ every month [they have] certain places _that_ you can drop them off . _that's_ what _i_ _do_ . [uh] _and _i_ i_ recycle aluminum glass [uh] newspapers . 
B|5| M: uh-oh . 
A|6| B: [so] _it's_ nice _to_ [have] you _know_ [one] place _that_ you can take them all _to_ instead _of_ driving [the] glass _to_ [one] place 
B|7| M: _yeah ._ 
A|8| B: right . [so] _it's_ [so] _that's_ nice . _it_ would be _it_ would be really nice if [they] [uh] came _to_ [the] house _to_ pick _it_ up [and they] just were talking about _a_ bill in tucson about _that_ _but uh_ [uh] _it_ didn't go through . 
B|9| M: [oh] [i] see . 
A|10| B: right _. _i_ guess_ what [they] what [they] were talking about here was [uh] was reducing [the] garbage collection in order _to_ make _that_ up or something you _know ._ 
B|11| M: _yeah ._ 
A|12| B: [uh] [so] _i guess_ _that's_ [one] option . 
B|13| M: [but] [i] think [that's] [a] bigger waste . 
A|14| B: _i guess_ [one] thing they're working on now is _recycling_ plastics too . like [uh] 
B|15| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|16| B: [have] you noticed _that_ on [the] bottom _of_ plastic goods [they have] this _little_ number now _that_ tells what _kind of_ plastic _it_ is ? 
B|17| M: _yeah_ they've started [to] [do] [that] . 
A|18| B: _yeah _i_ guess_ [the] problem _with_ plastic is there's [so] many different kinds [that] you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into [one] recycler . 
B|19| M: [uh] 
A|20| B: [yeah .] [so] now they're like marking [uh] they're _i don't know_ there's six seven eight different _kind of_ plastics [and they] [they] mark on [the] bottom what _kind_ _it_ is . 
B|21| M:  !!!!!! you're kidding . 
A|22| B: [so] _i guess_ [that] makes _it_ easy [to] recycle [and] then they're they're [uh] trying [to] make plastic goods [that] _don't_ [have] [a] bunch _of_ different plastics in them you _know_ [that] are [that] are only made out _of_ [one] _kind of_ plastic [so] [that] [that] makes _it_ easier _i guess_ . 
B|23| M:  !!!!!! iful !! 
A|24| B: right . 
B|25| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|26| B: where does your friend go [to] [to] recycle ? 
B|27| M: [uh] he goes [to] garland high [and] he he has [a] [recycling] center [but] [it's] not big enough for [uh] 
A|28| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| M: [but] she also [uh] . 
A|30| B: [yeah .] 
B|31| M: [but uh] . 
A|32| B: [yeah .] 
B|33| M: [but uh] [i don't know] [i guess] i've [kind of] gotten used [to] [it] [and i] don [i] mean [i] haven't [i] never tried [to] [uh] 
A|34| B: [i guess] [that's] how [it] gets passed on . you [know] when [one] person you hear from another person 
B|35| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|36| B: [and] then [uh] [and] then you [and] then you pass [it] on . 
B|37| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [it] seems [to] be catching on [uh] slowly [but] surely [i guess] 
B|39| M: [yeah i] [know [.] [i] i] [uh] . 
A|40| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: he's he's [a] [little] boy [with] [a] [with] [a] beard [and] [a] beard .
