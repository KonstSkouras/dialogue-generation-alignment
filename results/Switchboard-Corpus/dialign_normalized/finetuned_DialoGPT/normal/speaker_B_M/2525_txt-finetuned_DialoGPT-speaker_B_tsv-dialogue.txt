A|4| B: _and_ _uh_ _it_ didn't seem _like_ _it_ was _that_ congested _in_ _that that_ part . _you know_ because _to_ _me_ _where_ _we_ live _out_ here _in the_ north east _it_ _it's_ _there_ _are_ _a_ lot _of_ buildings _very_ close _to_ each _other_ 
B|5| M: _uh ._ 
A|6| B: _and the_ cities _are_ _very_ populated _with_ tenement housing _where_ _there_ _are_ _more_ than _one_ family _in_ _a_ house . _and_ _with_ _the uh_ people _that_ _are_ coming into _the_ country from _other_ countries _not_ knowing _the_ language 
B|7| M: _uh ._ 
A|8| B: _and_ [uh] _they're_ going _to_ _the_ _big_ cities . _it_ makes _it_ _very_ difficult . 
B|9| M: _uh i_ [know] _uh ._ 
A|10| B: _it_ _really_ does _and_ _and_ i've seen _the_ _same_ _thing_ _that_ _you're_ talking _about_ [uh] _much_ _more_ crime than ever before . drugs _of_ course [uh] _a big_ part _of_ _it_ _i think_ . 
B|11| M: _yeah ._ 
A|12| B: _and_ [uh _i] don't know_ _a_ lot _of_ younger people _you know_ into _more_ violent crimes . 
B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _that_ _that's_ _really_ sad _you know_ _you_ _got_ young boys _or_ girls _that_ _at_ fourteen _or_ twelve years old _that_ _are_ committing murders _and_ no remorse what _so_ ever . 
B|15| M: _yeah _i_ i think_ [that's] true . 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [and you] just [don't] hear anybody _talk_ _about it ._ 
A|18| B: [it] _is_ [and] _and _i_ don't _know_ if_ _it's_ _uh the_ family _you know_ _thing_ _where_ _they're_ _not_ bonding anymore _where_ mothers _are_ working _all_ _the_ _time_ _and the_ kids aren't getting _the_ attention _that they_ need _or_ _the_ television . 
B|19| M: [well] [that that] _would_ _be_ [a] _good_ _idea_ _. [i_ think] [i think] _the other_ [thing] [that's] _good_ [is] _the fact that_ [the [uh] the] parents [are] always _saying_ [you] [you] can [do] _this_ _or you_ can stay [at] _home_ . 
A|20| B: _and [i_ i] _really_ _think that_ we're we're falling by [the] wayside _with_ _not_ incarcerating these people . 
B|21| M:  !!! % _yeah i_ agree . 
A|22| B: [uh] [uh .] 
B|23| M: _i mean they_ _they've got_ _the the_ parole [thing] [and [the] uh] _they've_ [they _have] the_ [they] just [you] [you] _go through_ [the] [you] just _go through_ [a] period _of time_ [where] [you] _say_ okay _this is_ [the] punishment phase _and then_ [when] [it's] [all] over [and] over _and it's_ over _and they_ just hang around _for a_ _while_ _and then_ [they] [you] _get out_ _and they're_ paroled . 
A|24| B: [yeah] exactly . 
B|25| M: _and _they're_ out there_ _doing it_ _again ._ 
A|26| B: [and] [uh] _you know_ [they] had [uh] _in_ [fact] on [the] news last night _we_ were watching [this] [uh] man who lost his ten year old daughter . he ran [out] _to_ [the] store [for a] few minutes [and] he had left her [home] alone . now ten years old she's old enough _to be_ alone [for a] few minutes _you _know_ ._ 
B|27| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| B: [and] [while] he was gone he had looked went looking [for a] _job_ [and] stopped [at] [the] store [that's] what [it] was . [and] [uh] someone who was _in the_ neighborhood cleaning carpets these _two_ men went _in_ raped [the] girl murdered her [and the] whole bit . 
B|29| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|30| B: [and] _one_ [of] [the] men [got] [uh [i] think] [it] was seventeen years [and [the] other] _one_ was _in_ [for] [uh] life imprisonment . 
B|31| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|32| B: [the] _one_ [that] was _in_ [for] [the] seventeen years actually served seven [and] he's [out] . 
B|33| M: _wow ._ 
A|34| B: [and the] man _said _that_ _you_ know if_ [it] weren't [for] [the fact that] he [would] [go] _to_ _jail_ [that] he [would] eliminate [this] person himself . [and then] [go] _to_ mcdonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] _not_ [thing] [a] [thing] [think] [a] [thing] [about it .] 
B|35| M: [yeah .] 
A|36| B: _and _i_ mean [i_ _think] that_ what [this is] going _to_ lead _to_ [is] people will take things into their own hands . _and that_ innocent people 
B|37| M: [uh .] 
A|38| B: [i i] shouldn't [say] innocent because [i mean] actually _if they_ commit [a] crime _that they're_ _in the_ _same_ circumstances _but_ 
B|39| M: _right_ . 
A|40| B: [the] reasons _that they're_ [doing it] compared _to_ [the] reason someone else [is] _in_ _jail_ [for] [it] _you know it's_ _like_ _two_ different things . 
B|41| M: _right_ . 
A|42| B: sometimes [when] [you] lose someone _that you_ _really_ love [you] [do] some crazy things _i don't know_ 
B|43| M: [yeah well i] don [i mean i] don tinker _too_ [much] [with] [it] _but [i_ i] [do] [i] [have a] hard [time] [you're] _right_ _. i_ [do] _stuff_ [you] _don't _have_ [to_ be] [so] [uh] obsessive [about it] [that you] don taint over [it .] 
A|44| B: [i i] _like_ [the] [idea] _that uh if_ someone [is] from [a] foreign country [and they] come [to] [this] country [and] [uh] commit [a] crime [i _think] that_ irregardless [of] whether [they have] already become [a] citizen [or] anything [they] should [be] immediately deported . 
B|45| M: _right_ . 
A|46| B: especially _if_ [they're] found guilty [of] [the] crime . 
B|47| M: _right_ . 
A|48| B: _you know_ once [they] [they have] been arrested [and] _if they_ [know] beyond [a] shadow [of] [a] doubt these people [are] guilty . 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [that's] [it] _we_ [don't] take care [of] _them_ _we_ [don't] support _them_ nothing 
B|51| M: [yeah .] 
A|52| B: [i mean they] [go] [right] back [where] [they] came from . 
B|53| M: [right] . 
A|54| B: exactly [and] 
B|55| M: [so] 
A|56| B: [but] [that's] [uh] [they're] [so] close [i _i] don't_ consider mexican people _in the_ _same_ category [with] [uh] especially _like_ [uh] people who come from cultures [that] [don't [have] the] _same_ [uh] kind [of] moral upbringing [that] _we_ [have] . 
B|57| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|58| B: _like_ [you] take asian countries [or] [uh the] eastern countries [where] women [are] _like_ _in the_ foreground [uh] _in the_ background [and the] men [are] _in the_ foreground 
B|59| M: uh-hue . 
A|60| B: [and it's] _like_ _you know_ um [they] live back _in_ [where] _we_ came from _two_ hundred years ago . 
B|61| M: [uh] [that's] true . 
A|62| B: _you know_ we've advanced beyond [that] _and [i_ _think] that_ their [uh] mentality as far as [the] way [they] treat _them_ _and that_ kind _of thing_ _you know_ what [i mean] . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [and they] [said [that] they're] [very] [very] conservative [and _that] they don't_ want [to be] associated [with] [that] type [of thing] . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [and i] thought [well] _if you_ just train [them] [you] can make [them] [do] _your_ [job] 
A|68| B: [wow .] 
B|69| M:  !!! remind [me] [of] _that ._ 
A|70| B: [wow .] [you] better believe [it] [if you] wouldn't even [have to] leave [it] [i mean] 
B|71| M: [you know] _i'm not_ _sure_ [if] [you're] [a] true [uh] vegan [or] [not] [but] [you know] [you're] [not] supposed [to] eat any animal products unless [you] [you] die [of] leukemia [or] something [like] _that ._ 
A|72| B: [it] [would] [get] snatched [right] off [your] arm 
B|73| M: [right] . 
A|74| B: _oh_ _sure ._ 
B|75| M: _i mean [you_ know it's] [not] [like] [it's] [a big] deal . 
A|76| B: [that's] amazing [well] what's _the difference_ [there] [do] [you know] ? 
B|77| M: [i don't [know] _.] i_ _i'm not_ [really] [sure _.] _i_ think it's_ just [the difference] [in the] [in the] women's lib [and _the] the_ [more] liberal [uh] lib women's movements . 
A|78| B: _oh [i_ i] believe [in the] death penalty [i] [really] [do] . 
B|79| M: [yeah .] 
A|80| B: [yeah] [yeah [i] _think] that_ we're [too] easy . 
B|81| M: [i i] [do] [think [that] uh if] [uh .] 
A|82| B: [uh] [and] _we_ take [the [the] uh] civil liberties [uh] [stuff] [too] far . 
B|83| M: [right] . 
A|84| B: [you know] [like] people [that] [are] [in] prison [i mean] _we_ didn't put [them] [there] . [they] put themselves [in] [that] situation . 
B|85| M: [right] . 
A|86| B: [and] as far as [like] [them] [uh] entertaining [the] rights [that they] should [have] . 
B|87| M: [yeah .] 
A|88| B: [i mean] _we_ educate [them] _we_ feed [them] _we_ take care [of] [them] [and they] no sooner [get out] on [the] street [and they're] back [in] [again .] 
B|89| M: [right] . 
A|90| B: [i'm not] [saying] [they're] [all] bad [but [i] think] people who [are] guilty [of] [really] serious heinous crimes [do] [not] deserve [to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] their lives . 
B|91| M: [yeah .] 
A|92| B: [i [think] [that] they] should [be] put away . 
B|93| M: [well [i] don't [know] _.] [i_ think] [they] ought [to] [you know [if] _they] [get_ out] [of] [jail] [they] ought [not] [to be] allowed [to] [have] parole . 
A|94| B: [get] rid [of] [them] . exactly [. [i] i] [really] [i i [think] that] [that's] [the] whole key here . [this] plea bargaining baloney [where] [uh] [you know] [they] plead [to] [a] lesser crime [or] [uh] [they] plead guilty [in] [or [you] know] tell [about] someone else [and they] [they get] less [time] 
B|95| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|96| B: [or] [if] [they're] [in] [there] [and] [they've got] seventeen years [and they're] on [good] behavior [for] every year [they're] [in] [they get] [so] many less [you know] [that they don't] serve [the] full penalty . 
B|97| M: [uh] 
A|98| B: [i [i] i] [really] [think] we're going [to] far overboard [with] [all] [of] [this] . 
B|99| M: [right] . 
A|100| B: [yeah] _same_ [with] drunk drivers . 
B|101| M:  !!!!!! % !! [you] !! [it] !! [i] !! [that] !!?!! [well] !! [yeah] !! nice !! [you] !! [they] !! [have] !! translated !! [one] !! [one] !! [two] !! [we] !! [and] !! rem !! [same] !! okay !! [good] !! [same] !! great !! [so] !! [oh] !! 
A|102| B: [i think it's] [too] easy [for] [them] . 
B|103| M: [yeah .] 
A|104| B: [that] [if] [the the] laws [and] [and] were were harsher [and] were enforced 
B|105| M: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|106| B: [i mean you] [have to] set an example . [you] [have to] start somewhere . 
B|107| M: [right] . 
A|108| B: [and [i] [think] that] people [know] [that they're] going [to] [get] [a] slap on [the] wrist [they] might serve [a] little bit [of time] [and that] they'll [be] [out] on [the] street [again .] 
B|109| M: [yeah .] 
A|110| B: an [it] an [i] feel bad [for] [the] policeman because he's [out there] every day facing these people . [this] [this] craziness [you know] people [with] [uh] automatic weapons [and] [uh] [all] [this] [other] [stuff] [and] trying [to] [do] [a] [job] 
B|111| M: [uh] 
A|112| B: [and] let's face [it] what [do] [they get] paid . 
B|113| M: [right] . 
A|114| B: twenty thousand dollars [a] year [if] [they're] lucky [. i] wouldn't [do] [it] [for] [that .] 
B|115| M: [oh i] wouldn tinker [with] [that [.] [i] mean] you'd [be] surprised . 
A|116| B: [it] [is] [it] [really] [is] . [and [i] mean] [they're] [the] first ones [that] take [the] brunt [of] everything . 
B|117| M: [that's] true . 
A|118| B: [you know] [and] [i'm not] [saying] [that they're] [all] [good] either because there's [good] [and] bad [in] everything 
B|119| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|120| B: [but] [they] [they're] already [uh] [have] three strikes against [them] [when] [they're out there] . 
B|121| M: [right] . 
A|122| B: because they'll arrest someone [and [you] know] [go through] [all] [that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and you] [have to] even [be] careful how [you] arrest [them] how [you] [talk] [to] [them] [uh] [you know] what [they] [say]
