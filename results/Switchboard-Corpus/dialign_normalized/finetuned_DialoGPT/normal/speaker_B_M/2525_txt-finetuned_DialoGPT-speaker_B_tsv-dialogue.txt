A|2| B: _yeah _,_ _yeah_ , well_ _i , i_ went _to_ dallas _, uh ,_ _when_ _i_ worked _for_ t _i_ _in_ abilene _and _,_ uh _,_ i'm_ _a_ little familiar _with_ _the_ city area , forest lane _and _, you_ know ,_ _through_ _that ,_ off , off _the_ freeway . 
B|3| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|4| B: _and _,_ uh ,_ _it_ didn't seem _like_ _it_ was _that_ congested _in_ _that , that_ part . _you know_ because _to_ _me_ _where_ _we_ live _out_ here _in the_ north east , _it _,_ it's_ _there_ _are_ _a_ lot _of_ buildings _very_ close _to_ each _other_ , 
B|5| M: _uh ._ 
A|6| B: _and the_ cities _are_ _very_ populated _with_ tenement housing , _where_ _there_ _are_ _more_ than _one_ family _in_ _a_ house . _and_ _with_ _the _, uh_ ,_ people _that_ _are_ coming into _the_ country from _other_ countries , _not_ knowing _the_ language 
B|7| M: _uh ._ 
A|8| B: _and _,_ uh ,_ _they're_ going _to_ _the_ _big_ cities . _it_ makes _it_ _very_ difficult . 
B|9| M: _uh , i_ [know _,] uh ._ 
A|10| B: _it_ _really_ does _, _and_ _,_ and_ i've seen _the_ _same_ _thing_ _that_ _you're_ talking _about_ _, uh ,_ _much_ _more_ crime than ever before . drugs _of_ course _, uh ,_ _a big_ part _of_ _it_ _i think_ . 
B|11| M: _yeah ._ 
A|12| B: _and _,_ [uh _,_ i] don't [know_ ,] _a_ lot _of_ younger people _, you know ,_ into _more_ violent crimes . 
B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _that _,_ that's_ _really_ sad _, you know _,_ you_ _got_ young boys _or_ girls _, that_ _at_ fourteen _or_ twelve years old _that_ _are_ committing murders _and ,_ no remorse , what _so_ ever . 
B|15| M: _yeah _, i_ , i think_ [that's] true . 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [and , you] just [don't] hear anybody _talk_ _about it ._ 
A|18| B: [it] _is_ [and _,] _and_ _i_ don't know_ _if_ _it's_ _, uh _,_ the_ family _, you know ,_ _thing_ _where_ _they're_ _not_ bonding anymore , _where_ mothers _are_ working _all_ _the_ _time_ [and _,] the_ kids aren't getting _the_ attention _that they_ need _, or_ _the_ television . 
B|19| M: _well _,_ [that ,_ that] _would_ _be_ [a] _good_ _idea_ _. [i_ think] _, i think_ _the other_ [thing] [that's] _good_ [is] _the fact that_ [the , uh] [the] parents [are] always _saying_ [, you] [, you] can [do] _this_ [or] [you] can stay [at] _home_ . 
A|20| B: _and [i_ , i] _really_ _think that_ we're , we're falling by [the] wayside _with_ _not_ incarcerating these people . 
B|21| M:  !!! % _yeah , i_ agree . 
A|22| B: [uh [,] uh .] 
B|23| M: _i mean _,_ _they_ ,_ _they've got_ _the , the_ parole [thing] [and [the] , uh] _they've_ _, they _have_ [the_ _,] they_ just [, you] [, you] _go through_ [the [,] you] just _go through_ [a] period _of time_ [where] [you] _say_ okay _, _this_ is_ [the] punishment phase [, _and] then_ [when] [it's] [all] over [and] over _and it's_ over _and they_ just hang around _for a_ _while_ _and then_ _they [,_ you] _get out_ _and they're_ paroled . 
A|24| B: [yeah ,] exactly . 
B|25| M: _and _they're_ out there_ _doing it_ _again ._ 
A|26| B: [and _,] uh _,_ you know [,_ they] had _, uh _,_ in_ [fact] on [the] news last night _we_ were watching [this] _, uh ,_ man who lost his ten year old daughter . he ran [out] _to_ [the] store [for a] few minutes [and] he had left her [home] alone . now ten years old , she's old enough _to be_ alone [for a] few minutes _, you _know_ ._ 
B|27| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| B: [and] [while] he was gone , he had looked , went looking [for a] _job_ [and] stopped [at] [the] store _, that's_ what [it] was . [and _,] uh ,_ someone who was _in the_ neighborhood cleaning carpets , these _two_ men , went _in_ , raped [the] girl , murdered her [, [and] the] whole bit . 
B|29| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|30| B: [and] _one_ [of] [the] men [got] _, [uh [,_ i] think] [it] was seventeen years [and [the] other] _one_ was _in_ [for] _, uh ,_ life imprisonment . 
B|31| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|32| B: [the] _one_ [that] was _in_ [for] [the] seventeen years , actually served seven [, and] he's [out] . 
B|33| M: _wow ._ 
A|34| B: [and the] man _said_ [, that _,] you know , if_ [it] weren't [for] [the fact that] he [would] [go] _to_ _jail [,_ that] he [would] eliminate [this] person himself . [and then] [go] _to_ mcdonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] _not_ [thing] [a] [thing] , [think] [a] [thing] [about it .] 
B|35| M: [yeah .] 
A|36| B: _and [i_ mean [,] i _think] that_ what [this is] going _to_ lead _to_ [is] people will take things into their own hands . _and that_ innocent people , 
B|37| M: [uh .] 
A|38| B: [i , i] shouldn't [say] innocent , because [i mean ,] actually _if they_ commit [a] crime _that they're_ _in the_ _same_ circumstances _but ,_ 
B|39| M: _right_ . 
A|40| B: [the] reasons _that they're_ [doing it] compared _to_ [the] reason someone else [is] _in_ _jail_ [for] _it _,_ you know , it's_ _like_ _two_ different things . 
B|41| M: _right_ . 
A|42| B: sometimes [when] [you] lose someone _that you_ _really_ love [, you] [do] some crazy things _i don't [know_ ,] 
B|43| M: [yeah _, well] [,_ i] don _, i mean_ [i] don tinker _too_ [much] [with] [it _,] but [i_ , i] [do] [, i] [have a] hard _time ,_ [you're] _right_ _. i_ [do] _stuff_ [, you] _don't _have_ [to_ be] [so] [, uh ,] obsessive [about it] [that you] don taint over [it .] 
A|44| B: [i , i] _like_ [the] [idea] _that , uh , if_ someone [is] from [a] foreign country [, [and] they] come [to] [this] country [and] [uh ,] commit , [a] crime [, i _think] that_ irregardless [of] whether [they have] already become [a] citizen [or] anything [, they] should [be] immediately deported . 
B|45| M: _right_ . 
A|46| B: especially _if_ [they're] found guilty [of] [the] crime . 
B|47| M: _right_ . 
A|48| B: _you know ,_ once [they [,] they have] been arrested [and] _if they_ [know] beyond [a] shadow [of] [a] doubt , these people [are] guilty . 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [that's] [it ,] _we_ [don't] take care [of] _them ,_ _we_ [don't] support _them ,_ nothing , 
B|51| M: [yeah .] 
A|52| B: [i mean] [they] [go] [right] back [where] [they] came from . 
B|53| M: [right] . 
A|54| B: exactly [and ,] 
B|55| M: [so] , 
A|56| B: [but] [that's] [, uh ,] [they're] , [so] close [, i _, i] don't_ consider mexican people _in the_ _same_ category [with] [, uh ,] especially _like_ [, uh ,] people who come from cultures [that] [don't [have] the] _same_ [, uh ,] kind [of] moral upbringing [that] _we_ [have] . 
B|57| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|58| B: _like_ [you] take asian countries _, or_ [, uh [,] the] eastern countries [where] women [are] _like_ _in the_ foreground [, uh _,] in the_ background [and the] men [are] _in the_ foreground , 
B|59| M: uh-hue . 
A|60| B: [and it's] _like_ _, you know ,_ um [, they] live back _in_ [where] _we_ came from _two_ hundred years ago . 
B|61| M: [uh [,] that's] true . 
A|62| B: _you know ,_ we've advanced beyond [that [,] _and] [i_ _think] that_ their [, uh ,] mentality as far as [the] way [they] treat _them_ _and that_ kind _of thing_ _, you know_ what [i mean] . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [and they] [said] [that they're] [very] , [very] conservative [and _that] they don't_ want [to be] associated [with] [that] type [of thing] . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [and i] thought _, well [,_ if] [you] just train [them [,] you] can make [them] [do] _your_ [job] , 
A|68| B: [wow .] 
B|69| M:  !!! remind [me] [of] _that ._ 
A|70| B: [wow .] [you] better believe [it _,] if [,_ you] wouldn't even [have to] leave [it [,] [i mean] ,] 
B|71| M: [you know [,] _i'm] not_ _sure_ [if] [you're] [a] true [, uh ,] vegan [or] [not] _, [but_ [,] you know ,] [you're] [not] supposed [to] eat any animal products unless [you] [, you] die [of] leukemia [, or] something [like] _that ._ 
A|72| B: [it] [would] [get] snatched [right] off [your] arm 
B|73| M: [right] . 
A|74| B: _oh_ _sure ._ 
B|75| M: [i mean [,] you know , it's] [not] [like] [it's] [a big] deal . 
A|76| B: [that's] amazing [, well ,] what's _the difference_ [there] , [do] [you know] ? 
B|77| M: [i don't [know] _.] i [,_ _i'm] not_ [really] [sure _.] _i_ think it's_ just [the difference] [in [the] [,] in the] women's lib [and _the] , the_ [more] liberal [, uh] lib , women's movements . 
A|78| B: _oh [, i_ , i] believe [in the] death penalty [, i] [really] [do] . 
B|79| M: [yeah .] 
A|80| B: [yeah _,] [yeah_ [, i] _think] that_ we're [too] easy . 
B|81| M: [i , i] [do] [think [that] , uh [, if] [,] uh .] 
A|82| B: [uh [,] and] _we_ take [the , [the] [, uh] ,] civil liberties [, uh ,] [stuff] [too] far . 
B|83| M: [right] . 
A|84| B: [you know] [like] people [that] [are] [in] prison [, i mean] _we_ didn't put [them] [there] . [they] put themselves [in] [that] situation . 
B|85| M: [right] . 
A|86| B: [and] as far as [like] [them [,] uh ,] entertaining [the] rights [that they] should [have] . 
B|87| M: [yeah .] 
A|88| B: [i mean ,] _we_ educate [them ,] _we_ feed [them ,] _we_ take care [of] [them] [and they] no sooner [get out] on [the] street [and they're] back [in] [again .] 
B|89| M: [right] . 
A|90| B: [i'm not] [saying] [they're] [all] bad [, but [i] think] people who [are] guilty [of] [really] serious heinous crimes , [do] [not] deserve [to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] their lives . 
B|91| M: [yeah .] 
A|92| B: [i [think] [that] they] should [be] put away . 
B|93| M: [well [,] i don't [know] _.] [i_ think] [they] ought [to] [, you know , [if] _they] [get_ out] [of] [jail [,] they] ought [not] [to be] allowed [to] [have] parole . 
A|94| B: [get] rid [of] [them] . exactly [. [i ,] i] [really] [, i , i [think] that] [that's] [the] whole key here . [this] plea bargaining baloney , [where] [, uh [,] you know [,] they] plead [to] [a] lesser crime [, or] [, uh [,] they] plead guilty [in] [, or] [, you know ,] tell [about] someone else [and [they] [,] [they] get] less [time ,] 
B|95| M: [uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|96| B: [or] [, if] [they're] [in] [there] [and] [they've got] seventeen years [and they're] on [good] behavior , [for] every year [they're] [in] [they get] [so] many less [, you know [,] [that] they don't] serve [the] full penalty . 
B|97| M: [uh ,] 
A|98| B: [i [, i] , i] [really] [think] we're going [to] far overboard [with] [all] [of] [this] . 
B|99| M: [right] . 
A|100| B: [yeah ,] _same_ [with] drunk drivers . 
B|101| M:  !!!!,!! % !! [you] !! [it] !! [i] !! [that] !!?!! [well] !! [yeah] !! nice !! [you] !! [they] !! [have] !! translated !! [one] !! [one] !! [two] !! [we] !! [and] !! rem !! [same] !! okay !! [good] !! [same] !! great !! [so] !! [oh] !! 
A|102| B: [i think it's] [too] easy [for] [them] . 
B|103| M: [yeah .] 
A|104| B: [that] [if] [the , the] laws [, [and] [,] and] were , were harsher [and] were enforced , 
B|105| M: [yeah [,] that's] true . 
A|106| B: [i mean] [you] [have to] set an example . [you] [have to] start somewhere . 
B|107| M: [right] . 
A|108| B: [and [i] [think] that] people [know] [that they're] going [to] [get] [a] slap on [the] wrist [, they] might serve [a] little bit [of time] [and that] they'll [be] [out] on [the] street [again .] 
B|109| M: [yeah .] 
A|110| B: an , [it ,] an [i] feel bad [for] [the] policeman , because he's [out there] every day facing these people . [this] [, this] craziness [, you know ,] people [with] [, uh ,] automatic weapons [and [,] uh ,] [all] [this] [other] [stuff] [and] trying [to] [do] [a] [job] 
B|111| M: [uh ,] 
A|112| B: [and] let's face [it ,] what [do] [they get] paid . 
B|113| M: [right] . 
A|114| B: twenty thousand dollars [a] year [, if] [they're] lucky [. i] wouldn't [do] [it] [for] [that .] 
B|115| M: [oh , i] wouldn tinker [with] [that [.] [i] mean ,] you'd [be] surprised . 
A|116| B: [it] [is] , [it] [really] [is] . [and [i] mean ,] [they're] [the] first ones [that] take [the] brunt [of] everything . 
B|117| M: [that's] true . 
A|118| B: [you know [,] and] [i'm not] [saying] [that they're] [all] [good] either , because there's [good] [and] bad [in] everything , 
B|119| M: [uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|120| B: [but] [they ,] [they're] already [, uh ,] [have] three strikes against [them] [when] [they're out there] . 
B|121| M: [right] . 
A|122| B: because they'll arrest someone [and [, you] know ,] [go through] [all] [that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [, and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and] [you] [have to] even [be] careful how [you] arrest [them ,] how [you] [talk] [to] [them [,] uh [,] you know ,] what [they] [say] ,
