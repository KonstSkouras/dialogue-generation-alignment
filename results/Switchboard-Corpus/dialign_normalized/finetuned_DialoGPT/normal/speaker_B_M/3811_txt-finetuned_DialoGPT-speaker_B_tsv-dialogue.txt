B|21| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: [and] what [we] found [, uh ,] _to_ be the best guide was our own instincts about , people who were [going] _to_ be loving 
B|23| M: [uh] . 
A|24| B: [and , uh ,] [that's] more important than anything else . [we] could [have] sent [, uh ,] her _to_ [a] fancier [, uh ,] facility . 
B|25| M: right . 
A|26| B: [uh ,] she goes _to_ [a] _home_ . this is [a] [, uh ,] [a] couple [, uh ,] emigrated from china early in , in their lives .

A|32| B: [and] our daughter is healthy , happy , well adjusted [and] enjoys [going] _to_ _see_ her friends , 
B|33| M: [uh] . 
A|34| B: [so] it's [a] good experience . 
B|35| M: [yeah ,] i've never had [to] leave _my_ _kids_ _at_ [home] without [them] , 
A|36| B: _i_ if it's good _, i_ think it's very good [for] the child . 
B|37| M: [yeah [,] i] [, i] agree with [you] [there] . 
A|38| B: [and] if it's , [a] loving environment [, i] think it's very good [and ,] [and] [that's] [really] what we've learned about it . she'll [have] [to] go on [to] something more stimulating in terms [of] preschool in [a] [year] 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: but [, uh [,] we] feel [real] fortunate [and] [we] were able [to] [, uh ,] just [, uh ,] choose in the marketplace . [i] don't know what it's like around [, uh ,] hattiesburg . 
B|41| M:  !!! ; !! remind _me_ [of] _that ._ 
A|42| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah .]

A|46| B: [yeah] 
B|47| M: [so] [, uh] . 
A|48| B: well , [that's] [, uh [,] i] know it's , it's [a real] hard thing [to] do , even [for] people in , in [, [uh ,] university] communities . 
B|49| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| B: out here [at] manford , they [have a] , [you] know , [a] , [a] , [a real] good facility [and] [there] [, uh ,] is quite [a] waiting list [to] get into [that .] 
B|51| M: [oh [,] i] [see] . 
A|52| B: [so] it's [, uh [,] uh ,] [you] know , it's [a] , it's [a] , it's an important , decision , it's an industry [that's] still [a] cottage industry 
B|53| M: [uh] . 
A|54| B: [and] [i] think this is [really] is buyer beware . well , it is the best way [to] do it , interestingly . 
B|55| M: [that's] right . 
A|56| B: [i] think [that] [, uh ,] [my] own interest in , in development , human development leads [me] [to] believe [that] [that's a] good sign [and] [that] [, uh ,] private enterprise is the way [to] go [and] [that] it will lead [to] [a] fundamental [change] in the way [we] learn . 
B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: because [, i] think what we're [going] [to] go [to] is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . as [a] matter [of] fact , [my] future is banked on [that] [, uh ,] professionally because [i] believe [that] , [that] [there] are [, uh ,] pressing needs in the marketplace , unmet by schools , colleges universities [for] [, uh ,] learning [a] lot [of] things [that] [kids] can learn watching sesame street [and] in child care . 
B|59| M: right . right . right , right .
