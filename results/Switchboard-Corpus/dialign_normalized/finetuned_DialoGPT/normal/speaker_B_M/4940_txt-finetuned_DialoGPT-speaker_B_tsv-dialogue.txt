A|42| B: [so] [the] engine kicks on when [the] batteries need power [and] [it] turns off . 
B|43| M: [right .] 
A|44| B: interesting [thing] [about] gas [is] when [i] mean [about] battery powered cars [is] when you're [at] a stop light you're [not] using any any energy 
B|45| M: [uh] no . 
A|46| B: unlike a car where it's running . 
B|47| M: [right .] 
A|48| B: a electric car it's on demand [. i] mean it's either on [or] off . 
B|49| M: [oh] my . 
A|50| B: basically . 
B|51| M: [so] 
A|52| B: [you] [don't] [have to] shift [so] [you] cars become very simple all [of] a sudden too . 
B|53| M: [right .] 
A|54| B: very interesting . 
B|55| M: [so] 
A|56| B: [yeah .] there's there's a race [in] australia [with] solar powered cars . 
B|57| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|58| B: [and] ford [and] general motors [and] all those compete . 
B|59| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|60| B: [right .] [yeah] 
B|61| M: [but] [uh] 
A|62| B: g m [uh] chrysler announced [that] they're going [to] they're [well] they actually [have] [an] electric minivan . [yeah .] their their caravan . [but] [it] costs [uh] fifty thousand dollars [right] now . 
B|63| M: [yeah .]

B|65| M: [right .] 
A|66| B: kind [of] interesting [so] [see .]
