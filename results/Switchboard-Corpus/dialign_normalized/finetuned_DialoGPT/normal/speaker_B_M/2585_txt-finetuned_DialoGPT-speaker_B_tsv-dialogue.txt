B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [and i] like [it [.] and] [what] i've been thinking [about] [doing] [is] volunteering [for] [this] [uh] asian center [that] [a] doctor falk has started [that] works [with the] [school] district . 
B|75| M: [uh] [that's] _wonderful_ . 
A|76| B: [and] [doing] [what] trying [to] get [them] [set] up inculturated [into the] [system] .

B|99| M: [right .]

B|101| M: [right .] 
A|102| B: [so] they'll [have] [to] go back [and] get [a] degree here [. you know] almost start [all] over .
