A|62| B: [but] anyway [, i] [enjoy] [it .] [they [, they] [,] the] kids i've worked [with] [so] far [have] been _spanish_ speaking . 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [and] 
B|65| M: [well ,] [that's] neat . 
A|66| B: [but] i'm applying [for] , [what] ? [yeah [,] it] [is .] 
B|67| M: [it's] [spanish] . 
A|68| B: [a] lot [of] our words [are] [the] [same] ,

A|70| B: like [, you know , they] [just] change [the] pronunciation [a] little bit . 
B|71| M: [right .] [right .] 
A|72| B: [but , i] love [it [.] i] love [the] culture [, uh [,] [the] way] [that] [they [,] uh [,] they] respect education [and] [their] teachers [their] parents , [so] [much] more than , than [my] [children] [do] [. you know ,] 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [and i] like [it [.] and] [what] i've been thinking [about] [doing] [is] volunteering [for] [this [,] uh ,] asian center [that [,] a] doctor falk has started [, that] works [with the] [school] district . 
B|75| M: [uh ,] [that's] _wonderful_ . 
A|76| B: [and] [doing] [what] , trying [to] get [them] [set] up , inculturated , [into the] [system] . 
B|77| M: [right .] 
A|78| B: [i] thought [that] would [be] [good] experience [for] [me .]

A|88| B: [my] neighbor , let's [see] , [is] jewish [. and] he's [going] through [the [,] i don't know [,] the] jewish league [or] something [. and] [helping] [a] family [that's] [come] over from russia . 
B|89| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|90| B: [and] he spends [, well ,] [right] [now] , he's down [to] like once [a] week , [but] he [was] [going] over [there] several times [a] week [to] [be] [with the] family [, and] [help] [them [with] the] [language .] 
B|91| M: [oh [,] uh [,] uh] .

B|95| M: [i don't know] . 
A|96| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: [but [,] uh] . 
A|98| B: [uh-huh .] what's [so] sad [about] [this] [is] both [of] [the , the] man [and] [the] woman had [a] degree having [to] [do] [with] computers [but ,] [their] training isn't [what] [we] need [in] [this] [country] . 
B|99| M: [right .] 
A|100| B: [and] [because] [they're] [so] deficient [in] english [, they] haven't been [able] [to] get jobs . 
B|101| M: [right .] 
A|102| B: [so] they'll [have] [to] go back [and] get [a] degree here [. you know ,] almost start [all] over . 
B|103| M: [that's true .] 
A|104| B: no , no [. and] [this] woman [was] [, uh ,] stocking [the] shelves [in a] drugstore .
