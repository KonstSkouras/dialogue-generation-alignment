A|12| B: [yeah .] 
B|13| M: [and] _it's it's_ _really_ [a] pain . 
A|14| B: _well_ _that's_ true [and] lot [of] times though _it_ is _it_ costs [so] much _to get_ _something_ _fixed_ _that you_ almost are _just_ [as] _well_ off buying another _one_ [you _know] if_ [it's]

A|16| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| M:  !!! % !! remind me .

B|19| M: [uh] _well _i_ don't_ [know if] _you've_ heard about [the] [the] [uh] [the] sears [uh] sears [the] [one] [that] [uh] [that] [just] [opened] [up] here [a] few months ago . 
A|20| B: [i] [you] [i think] there's _there_ can _be_ [a] lemon _in_ anything _but_ [uh [i] think] more often than _not_ 
B|21| M: uh-uh . [yeah [i] i] agree _with_ [you] [there] . 
A|22| B: _you you_ pretty [well] [know] what _you're_ getting ahead [of] time [and] _uh you [know_ if] [you] buy [a] good [one] [you] shouldn't _have_ any [you know] too much [of] [a] problem [with] [it] 
B|23| M: [that's] right . 
A|24| B: _i mean_ we we _had_ [a] car once [that] we tried _to have_ declared [a] lemon under [the] lemon law which is extremely difficult _to do ._ 
B|25| M: right right . 
A|26| B: we never could [get it] declared [a] lemon [and] [the] car _would_ go [and] without any warning whatsoever [you] could _be_ _going_ down [the] freeway at sixty [and] _it would_ stop 
B|27| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: _and i_ [there] was [just] [you know] [and] [oh] we went round [and] round [with] [the] manufacturer _and and_ _everything_ _and they_ _got_ [it] finally semifixed _but_ [it] was such [a] hassle 
B|29| M: [yeah .] 
A|30| B: [yeah yeah] _it it_ [really] is [uh] _but_ gee _this_ is [of] all [the] topics [i] _have had_ i'm doing _this_ thing _this_ is kind [of the] strangest [one] . 
B|31| M: [well] [it's] funny _because_ i've talked [to] _people_ who [have had] dogs [and they] say [that] [they] [have the] greatest reactions . 
A|32| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| M: [and] they're [not] [going] [to] they're saying [well] [you] [can't] [have] [you're] [not] allowed [to have] [it] anymore [and i] thought [you you] [got] [to [get] it] [and] [you're] supposed _to you_ [have] [to make] [this] deal [so] [you] didn't [you] [don't] [want] [to make] [a] deal [you] [want] [to get] rid [of] [it .]

B|45| M: right right . 
A|46| B: [well] [yeah] [that's] [that's] true .
