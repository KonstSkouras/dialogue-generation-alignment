A|0| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|1| M: _so_ _i_ _i_ thought _well_ i'll _try_ _that ._ 
A|2| B: _uh_ [i] _didn't_ _think_ [that] _was_ _a_ new revelation . 
B|3| M: _well_ _it_ [was] . 
A|4| B: right . [so] _what_ _what_ _is_ _the _e_ p a_ recommending _now_ ? 
B|5| M: _well_ [e p a] _has_ been _doing_ [a] lot _of_ [uh] _you_ know [a] lot more research _and uh_ _and_ _they_ have _they_ have _really_ _really_ [uh] ... 
A|6| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| M: _and _uh_ [the_ e] s [p a] [was] _the one_ [that] said [that] _they_ should have been more involved _with the_ war . 
A|8| B: _yeah ._ 
B|9| M: _and uh_ _they_ were saying _that uh the_ _waste_ [is] not being _recycled ._ _it's_ being burned . 
A|10| B: right . _that's_ [a] _that's_ [a] common problem though . [that] [it] seems [that] [has] happened _in_ dallas as [well] as new york [and] [i] [try] _to_ recycle all _of the_ newspapers [that] come _to_ my house [and] after [a] while [i] _just_ quit taking _the newspaper_ _because_ [i] couldn't recycle [it] anymore which isn't good _for_ business on [the] other end _either_ [i] suppose . 
B|11| M: [yeah] i've i'm not [a] real big fan [of [the] newspaper] [either] . 
A|12| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| M: _and they're_ trying [to] start _putting_ [the] recycling _in the_ _in the_ bins out front _and and_ [the] _like_ . 
A|14| B: right . 
B|15| M: _and uh_ . 
A|16| B: [well] _that's_ good . 
B|17| M: [so] 
A|18| B: right . there [has] [to] be [uh] [a] reuse _for_ _it _._ i_ mean _that's_ why [they] recycle . [the one] _i think_ [is] [the] most interesting [is] [with the] [recycled] bottles [and] all [that uh the] industry seems [to] be [doing] [with the] [recycled] polymers . [uh] everything from [uh] [waste] baskets [to] carpet [to] [the] _no_ stick [i] mean [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
B|19| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: [and uh] _i think_ [they] are even [putting] [it] [in the] roadways these days [and they're] making clothes _now_ [that] are [recycled .] [like] [the] [recycled] plastic coke bottles [and and] milk cartons [and] things [like] [that .] 
B|21| M: [uh] [they] have those [in the] [uh] [in the] parks . 
A|22| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| M: [so] he went [in] [and and] he got [the] engineering major [and] he proved [that] [that] he could do [it] by [just] using [the] engineering degree . 
A|24| B: oh [really] . 
B|25| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] 
A|26| B: right . 
B|27| M: _but_ [uh] 
A|28| B: huh . 
B|29| M: [so] [i] [i think] [that's] [the] major [uh] _change_ [is] [that uh] . 
A|30| B: [well] [it's] carbon [so] [that] makes sense [like] [a] carbon fuel [of] some sort [but] _what_ _what_ _about_ emissions ? 
B|31| M: [uh] [yeah _.] well_ [i] don't know how [they] would how they'd do [it] [with] gasoline [. i] guess they'd have [to] burn [it] 
A|32| B: oh . 
B|33| M: [and and] he didn tinker [with] [it .] he he tinker [but] [but] he didn _you_ know [it] [it] [was] [it] got [it] wasn't [it] [didn't] get anywhere near [what] he [was] trying [to] do . 
A|34| B: okay 
B|35| M: [well] [what] do _you_ [think] [of] [uh the] space shuttle landing ? 
A|36| B: _no_ [. well] [it's] interesting [. _i] bet_ [that] [was] [a] good day at [the] [yeah] conference then . 
B|37| M: [yeah] [i bet] [it] [was] . 
A|38| B: did [it] [change] anything _for you_ ? 
B|39| M: [no] not [really] [because] i've had [it] [for you] know i've been [in] this [for] [i] guess [about] three years [now] .
