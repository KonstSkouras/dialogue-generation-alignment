B|43| M: _but we_ had power . [we] had four h p m here [in] mckinney . 
A|44| B: _are_ [you] serious ?

B|53| M: _so it's_ [it is a] [real] change . 
A|54| B: _right ._ [yeah .] 
B|55| M: _and _and_ [it's_ it's a] [real] problem . 
A|56| B: _right ._ 
B|57| M: _but uh_ [they] [do they] [have] [the] facilities _to do it ._ 
A|58| B: [and] [we] go along [and] [i'm] [really] _not sure_ [how] [we] find [the] individuals [but we] find older _people_ [that] cannot afford [to] fix _up_ their homes [that] desperately _need_ [it] [and uh] [we] go along _with_ _all the_ material [and] [in] one _day_ [more] or less go [in] [and] say roof paint fix whatever [we] _can_ . 
B|59| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [yeah] [and] spend [a] _day_ doing [that's] [really] _neat [. [i_ mean] it's not] [a lot] because _you're_ [just] doing [a] house at [a] time [but] [you know] every little bit _helps_ . 
B|61| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| B: [uh] [yeah .] [they] [uh] luckily [we] _have [a_ a] man who owns [a] [building] company . 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [so] he donates [a lot] [not] everything [but] [a lot _of] the_ material . then _what_ he doesn't donate _we just_ go _out_ [and] buy . 
B|65| M: [right .] 
A|66| B: [yeah .] [and [it's] not] [you know] [we] [don't] promote _it [a_ lot] outside [the] community because [we] [don't] _want_ recognition [for] [it you know] _so much_ [as] _we just want to_ help _people_ _out_ . 
B|67| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| B: [so it's] [real] [neat .] 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [it's] [yeah] 
B|71| M: [and [it's] _it's] like_ [uh] 
A|72| B: [it's like] [i] say [it's not] [a lot] [but] [it] _helps_ _people_ . [like] _this_ last couple [we] helped [you know] [they [were] in] their eighties _and she_ [was] bedridden _and _i_ _just_ [you_ know] [just] tears your heart _out_ [to] [to see] _this_ _kind of_ [thing] 
B|73| M: [yeah .] 
A|74| B: [and] [you know] [if] _you can do_ [any] [a] little bit [it] _helps_ [so] 
B|75| M: [oh] [i know] [. i know [i] _do] it_ [too _. i] just_ _can't_ seem [to get] [over] [the] fact [that i] [need] _to do it _._ i don't_ [know] why [i] don trenches [. [i] do] [all the] [other] [stuff] . 
A|76| B: [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [that] [helps] _a lot ._ 
A|78| B: [yeah .] 
B|79| M: [and] [other] ones [did you] [you] [just] had [to] meet [people] 
A|80| B: gosh . [that's] _great_ . [that's] [a lot .] 
B|81| M: [so] [i] [i think _i] mean i'm_ [not sure] [you] [you're] [right] [that] [the] [that] [there] [is a] [great] deal [of] responsibility [and i _think] that_ [you can] [see] [where] [that] comes [in] handy . 
A|82| B: [that's] [that's] [a lot of] [kids] [though .] 
B|83| M: [yeah . i] [i know [i] think _that's] the_ only [thing] [i] [can] [think] [of] [that's] [uh] . 
A|84| B: [oh] _well_ still [that's] [a] [you know] [that's] [a good] chunk [of] [kids] . 
B|85| M: [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah .] 
B|87| M: _and _and_ [and_ it] [was] [just you] [you] knew [you] [were] going [to get] into [a] class [that] [was] going [to] be about [the] same [as] theirs . 
A|88| B: [yeah .] [that's neat .] 
B|89| M: [so] [that] [was] [kind of] [neat . i] [i] [uh] . 
A|90| B: [that's] [great] . 
B|91| M: [so] 
A|92| B: [that's] [great] . [but uh] [like] i'll _agree with_ [you] [though] [i don't] _think they_ should _have [to_ do] [a] year 
B|93| M: [no] [i] [i] [agree with] [that .] 
A|94| B: [yeah [. i] don't] [think that] [some] [people] [i don't] [think] [have] [uh a] year [in] _them_ [to] volunteer [if] [you know] _what_ [i mean] . they're [not] worth [it] 
B|95| M: [yeah] 
A|96| B: [right .] [oh] [yeah] [that's] true [that's] true . 
B|97| M: [and uh] . 
A|98| B: [oh] . 
B|99| M: [and she] _works_ _in the_ same [kind of] station [with] t v [you] [don't] hear about [them] .

B|101| M: [but uh] . 
A|102| B: [i] couldn't _either_ . 
B|103| M: [oh] [i] [was] [just] thinking [that's what] _that's the_ only [thing] [i] [can] [really] [think] [of] [that] [would] [really] be [a] crime [you] wouldn't [know] anything about [it] 
A|104| B: [right] [right .] 
B|105| M: [and i think] [the] [the] [and i [think] that] [the] [i think they] [have a] very [i don't] [know i] [i'm] [not] [really] [sure] [what] [the] [what] [the] quality [of the] [of the] products [they] put [out] [are] [you're] [you] [have to] wonder [you] _can't_ [you] [don't] [just] _can't_ tell . 
A|106| B: [yeah [. i] just] [know] one person [that's] [in the] peace corps [and [i] mean] she's [a] teacher [and and] [just] wanted [to do it .] she'd [been] [a] teacher [for] [a] while . [just] decided [she] wanted [to do it] [so] [. [i mean] i'm] grateful [for] [people] [like] [that] [but [i] don't] [see] [how they] [can] [just] [yeah] 
B|107| M: [i don't] [either] [i think] there's [so much] pressure [i just] [i guess] [you] [just] [have to] accept [that] there's [a] limit [on] [on] [what] [you can do] . 
A|108| B: [just] pick _up_ [and] head [on] [out] . 
B|109| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| B: [i] wish [i] [could] [do] something [like] [that] [but i] [can't] [so] 
B|111| M: [well] [i think] [i've] always considered [it a] hobby . 
A|112| B: [right] [that's the] [way] [i] am [. i know] [the] feeling . 
B|113| M: [but uh] [it's [a] lot of] work [i mean i'm] [not] into sitting around [and] taping [up] [the] whole [day] [you know] . 
A|114| B: [that's] [right] [we're] against [it] [that's] [right .] 
B|115| M: [yeah .] 
A|116| B: [you] [too] [and i] hope everything [works] [out] [up] [there] . 
B|117| M: okay . 
A|118| B: [yeah .]
