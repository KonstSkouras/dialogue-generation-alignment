B|65| M: [right .] 
A|66| B: [yeah .] [and [it's] not] [, you know [,] we] [don't] promote _it [a_ lot] outside [the] community because [we] [don't] _want_ recognition [for] [it , you know] _so much_ [as] _, we just want to_ help _people_ _out_ .

B|85| M: [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah .]

B|95| M: [yeah]

B|107| M: [i don't] [either] [, i think] there's [so much] pressure [, i just [,] i guess [,] you] [just] [have to] accept [that] there's [a] limit [on] , [on] [what] [you can do] .
