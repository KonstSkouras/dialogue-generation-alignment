A|56| B: [i know] [i'm] always scared _of that_ whenever [i] [go to a game] _. i_ rarely [go] [but] [we went] last year [because] _my_ brother _my_ brother [is] impossible _when_ um [he] does [football] leagues [and] [baseball] leagues [and] _all kinds of_ _stuff_ 
B|57| M: [oh really ?] 
A|58| B: [and] [if] there's [a game on] [he's] watching [it _.] _i_ mean_ [that's] [all] [there] [is] [to] [it]

A|60| B: [and he's] [like] glued [at the] _t v_ . 
B|61| M: [uh] . 
A|62| B: [oh] [i'm] glad _my_ husband's [not] [like that] either _i'd_ kill [him] _my_ brother's [like that] [and] um [see] [he] goes [to _a] lot of_ games _not a real_ _lot_ [but] [he] tries [to go] then _my_ father [got] us _some_ tickets 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [so] _my_ brother's wife [and] _my_ husband [and i] [went] . last year [we] wanted [to] show _my_ husband what [a] [baseball] [game] [was] [because] [you know] being [a] non-american [you] want [to] [see] what [a] [baseball] [game] [is] [like] . 
B|65| M: [uh] . 
A|66| B: [and he] describes [it] as [you] sit [there] [in] [a] crowd _it was_ nice weather _and stuff_ [it] wasn't _a real_ problem _but you_ sit [there] [in] [a] crowd [and] _you're_ waiting [and] waiting [and] waiting [and] [you] eat [these] lousy [the] hot dogs um [because] [we] made [him] [try] [a] hot dog [you know] 
B|67| M: _oh my_ gosh . 
A|68| B: [and] um _so you_ sit [there and] [you] wait [for the] longest time [really] bored [and] then [all] [of] [a] sudden something happens _but you_ happen [to] look [the other] way during [the] time 
B|69| M: [yeah .] 
A|70| B: [yeah] _and so_ _you're_ basically [you] sit [there and] wait [for] something exciting [to] happen [and] _when_ [it] happened [he] missed [it] [and] _didn't_ understand [it] um [he] _grew up_ _out_ [well] [he] _grew up_ [in] which [is] [the] sort [of] o strip east [to] west eastern part 
B|71| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [but] [that] 
B|73| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] . [that's] [funny] [because] [that's] [where] [i] [grew up] . 
A|74| B: [yeah] [he's] _not that_ far [he was] sort [of] [in] between strasbourg [and] paris . 
B|75| M: [yeah] 
A|76| B: [oh] [is] _she_ still [there] ? 
B|77| M: [yeah] 
A|78| B: [because]

B|83| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| B: _and it_ [it] [it] [it] sits right [at the] limit 
B|85| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| B: [i] exactly [where] _she_ [is _.] but_ um [we] met [in] paris . 
B|87| M: [uh] i'll bet [you [that] was] quite [a] experience . 
A|88| B: twelve children ? 
B|89| M: [yeah .] 
A|90| B: [oh my] god [the] poor woman . 
B|91| M: [yeah] [yeah] [she] has [uh] [i mean] [i'm] sure [she] has [some] [some] work [to do] [on] [that .] 
A|92| B: _were_ any [of them] _twins_ ? 
B|93| M: [oh] [yeah] _two of them_ [were] [twins] . 
A|94| B: [you] probably [can't] afford [to] eat [if] _you have_ more than [two of them] 
B|95| M: [oh] [i know] . 
A|96| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: [so you] [can] [you know] [you] [can] [get] [them] [for] [you're] [you have] [to] pay extra [for] those [because they're] [they're] [really] expensive . 
A|98| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|99| M: [they] [don't] [you] [don't] [see] [you see] [them] getting married [or] anything [but they] don [they] [go] [out] [and] [they] [go] [they] [do] [all kinds of] things [so] . 
A|100| B: [but] [how do] [they] afford [to] even _have the_ _kids_ [uh] [we're] expecting our first baby almost any day [uh-huh .] 
B|101| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of [that] .] 
A|102| B: wow .

A|104| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: [so] 
A|106| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: [but] [it's] [uh] [it's] [not a real] easy read . 
A|108| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [and it] [it's] [it] teaches [them] [how] [to] deal [with] problems [and] [how] [how] [to] fix [them] [and] [uh] [you] [don't] _just_ [have] [to be] good [at] [it .] [you have] [to] [you have] [to] [have the] discipline [to do that .] 
A|110| B: _i [i_ don't know] what _foley's_ [is] 
B|111| M: f [foley's] an electronics company . 
A|112| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|113| M: [but] [they're] [not that] expensive . 
A|114| B: [yeah .] 
B|115| M: [i mean] [it's] [it was [a] lot of] money [you have] [to] pay [for] everything [but you] don [have] [to [do] it .] 
A|116| B: [yeah] [well] [that] makes [a] [really] [big] difference _. but_ [but] still [it's just] as hard as having [that] 
B|117| M: [oh] [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|118| B: [but] your cousin could _have a_ [baseball] team [with] twelve _kids_ 
B|119| M: [yeah] 
A|120| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|121| M: [yeah] [that's] [that was] [one] thing [that i] [did] [i] [did] [that] [when i] [was] [i] [was] [with] [the] church [and [i] didn't] [do it] anymore [. [i] i] [just] 
A|122| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|123| M: [and so] [it's] [it's] [a little] difficult [for] [me] [to get] started [on] [it] [because] [i] don [i] don [have [a] lot of] friends [that] are into sports [and so] [i] don tinker around [with] [it [.] but] [uh] [you [see] [a] lot] [on] [t v] [with] [kids] [and stuff] [and] [i'd] [like] [to] start [that] sometime . 
A|124| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|125| M: [i don't know] . 
A|126| B: [i] admire someone [that] [can] [do [that] [you] know i] [really] [can] .
