B|57| M: [oh , really ?]

B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [so] _my_ brother's wife [and] _my_ husband [and i] [went] . last year [we] wanted [to] show _my_ husband what [a] [baseball] [game] [was] [because] [, you know ,] being [a] non-american [you] want [to] [see] what [a] [baseball] [game] [is] [like] . 
B|65| M: [uh] . 
A|66| B: [and he] describes [it] as [, you] sit [there] [in] [a] crowd _, it was_ nice weather _and stuff_ _, it_ wasn't _a real_ problem _, but you_ sit [there] [in] [a] crowd [, and] _you're_ waiting [and] waiting [and] waiting [and] [you] eat [these] lousy [the] hot dogs um _, because_ [we] made [him] [try] [a] hot dog [, you know ,] 
B|67| M: _oh , my_ gosh . 
A|68| B: [and ,] um _, _so_ you_ sit [there and] [you] wait [for the] longest time [really] bored [, and] then [all] [of] [a] sudden something happens _but you_ happen [to] look [the other] way during [the] time , 
B|69| M: [yeah .] 
A|70| B: [yeah [,] _and] so_ _you're_ basically [you] sit [there and] wait [for] something exciting [to] happen [and] _when_ [it] happened [he] missed [it [,] and] _didn't_ understand [it] um [, he] _grew up_ _out_ [, well [,] he] _grew up_ [in] , which [is] [the] , sort [of] o strip east [to] west , eastern part , 
B|71| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [but] [that ,] 
B|73| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] . [that's] [funny] [, because] [that's] [where] [i] [grew up] . 
A|74| B: [yeah [,] he's] _not that_ far [, he was] sort [of] [in] between strasbourg [, and] paris . 
B|75| M: [yeah] 
A|76| B: [oh ,] [is] _she_ still [there] ? 
B|77| M: [yeah]

A|80| B: [yeah ,] saint claude , 
B|81| M: [yeah .] 
A|82| B: [yeah ,] [we] used _to _,_ that's_ [one] [of] [the] , um , entrances [to] [the] periphery [to get] [in] [and] _out_ [of] [the] city . 
B|83| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| B: _and it _,_ [it_ _,] [it_ _,] it_ sits right [at the] limit , 
B|85| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| B: [i] exactly [where] _she_ [is _.] but ,_ um , [we] met [in] paris . 
B|87| M: [uh ,] i'll bet [you] [that was] quite [a] experience . 
A|88| B: twelve children ? 
B|89| M: [yeah .] 
A|90| B: [oh , my] god , [the] poor woman .

A|92| B: _were_ any [of them] _twins_ ? 
B|93| M: [oh] [yeah [,] _two] of them_ [were] [twins] . 
A|94| B: [you] probably [can't] afford [to] eat [if] _you have_ more than [two of them] 
B|95| M: [oh [,] [i] know] . 
A|96| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: [so you] [can] [, you know [,] you] [can] [get] [them] [for] , [you're] [, [you] have] [to] pay extra [for] those [, [because] they're] , [they're] [really] expensive . 
A|98| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|99| M: [they] [don't] [, you] [don't] [see [,] [you] see] [them] getting married [or] anything [, [but] they] don [, they] [go] [out] [and] [they] [go [,] they] [do] [all kinds of] things [, so] . 
A|100| B: [but] [how do] [they] afford [to] even _have the_ _kids_ [, uh [,] we're] expecting our first baby , almost any day [uh-huh .] 
B|101| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of [that] .]

A|104| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: [so] , 
A|106| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: [but] [it's] [, uh [,] it's] [not a real] easy read . 
A|108| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [and it [,] it's] [, it] teaches [them] [how] [to] deal [with] problems [, and] [how] , [how] [to] fix [them] [, [and] [,] uh [,] you] [don't] _just_ [have] [to be] good [at] [it .] [you have] [to [,] [you] have] [to] [have the] discipline [to do that .] 
A|110| B: _i [, i_ don't know] what _foley's_ [is] 
B|111| M: f [foley's] an electronics company . 
A|112| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|113| M: [but] [they're] [not that] expensive . 
A|114| B: [yeah .] 
B|115| M: [i mean [,] it's] [, it was [a] lot of] money [, [you] have] [to] pay [for] everything [, but you] don [have] [to [do] it .] 
A|116| B: [yeah [,] well _,] that_ makes [a] [really] [big] difference _. but [,_ _but] ,_ still [it's just] as hard as having _, [that_ ,] 
B|117| M: [oh [,] yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|118| B: [but] your cousin could _have a_ [baseball] team [with] twelve _kids_ 
B|119| M: [yeah] 
A|120| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|121| M: [yeah [,] that's] [, [that] was] [one] thing [that i] [did] [, i] [did] [that] [when i] [was [,] i] [was] [with] [the] church [, and [i] didn't] [do it] anymore [. [i] , i] [just] , 
A|122| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|123| M: [and so] [it's] [, it's] [a little] difficult [for] [me] [to get] started [on] [it] [because] [i] don [, i] don [have [a] lot of] friends [that] are into sports [and so] [i] don tinker around [with] [it [.] but [,] uh [,] [you] [see] [a] lot] [on] [t v] [with] [kids] [and stuff] [and] [i'd] [like] [to] start [that] sometime . 
A|124| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|125| M: [i don't know] . 
A|126| B: [i] admire someone [that] [can] [do [that] [, you] know , i] [really] [can] .
