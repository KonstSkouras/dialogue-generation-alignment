A|0| B: _well_ we live _uh_ pretty close _to_ _the_ mesquite _golf course_ . 
B|1| M: _oh_ uh-hoh . 
A|2| B: _so_ we will play either _out_ there or at firewheel . _that is_ usually where we play _but _i_ have_ played _you know_ different courses _in_ _in the_ dallas area . 
B|3| M: _well [that_ is] neat . _what_ [is] your favorite [golf course] ?

B|9| M: _yeah_ that's true . 
A|10| B: [i] find [that] _when i_ ride _in_ _a_ cart [i] play better _and i_ think _it is_ cause [i] don't _get_ as tired 
B|11| M: [uh] that's true . 
A|12| B: [yeah .] 
B|13| M: [so] [i] _i guess_ i'm kind [of] [uh] _. _i_ guess_ it's more [a] _matter of_ [you know] [i] don [i] _can't_ _go_ _out _and_ do something_ [and] [you] i'm [not] _really_ motivated

A|18| B: right . 
B|19| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|20| B: right .

B|27| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| B: [oh] okay . 
B|29| M: [and] [so] [i have] [i] am [in the] process [of] quitting [that] [and] [going] [into] [a] company [that is] hiring more people . 
A|30| B: [you] must [have] [a] [a] son . 
B|31| M: [yeah .] he [is] three . 
A|32| B: [oh] okay . 
B|33| M: [and] [uh] .

B|35| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|36| B: [oh] [well that] sounds [like] fun too 
B|37| M: [yeah] [it is] it's _really_ neat . 
A|38| B: [uh-huh .] [well] [you] need _to_ [uh] teach them how _to_ play [and] take them [out] on [the] [course] with [you] 
B|39| M: [uh] [well] that's true [i] i've [uh] i've always done [that] [but] i've [just] recently [uh]

B|47| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|48| B: right _. [yeah_ i know] [what] [you] mean 
B|49| M: [and [that] is] 
A|50| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|52| B: [oh] [yeah .] [it] [it is] [just] nice _to get_ outdoors [and do something] . 
B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: [well] flower gardens [. i] [like] _to_ [have] [matter of] fact this past weekend [i] [just] [got] finished planting [a] bunch [of] tulips [and] daffodil bulbs . [so] _those_ ought _to_ be coming up around spring time 
B|55| M: [oh] _really_ ? 
A|56| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [and _i] had_ [to get] all [those] off _. and_ [uh] .

[so] if [you] start putting them [you know] [you] can put them [out] [in the] spring too [but] once [it] starts getting real hot then [it] [just] kills them cause they [can't] stand [the] hot weather . 
B|63| M: [well] [i have] _i _do_ some_ [water] aerobics . 
A|64| B: no they won't make [it] through [the] summer because [it] gets too hot [but] they make [it] through probably winter [and] spring . [so] 
B|65| M: [oh] that's [good] . 
A|66| B: [yeah [i] have] [got] [some] [of] [those] too cause [i] love flowers 
B|67| M: [uh] [what] kind [of] trees [do you] [have] ? 
A|68| B: [yeah [.] [and] [i] do] [i] try [to] [do some] arts [and] crafts [and i] love [to] [go]
