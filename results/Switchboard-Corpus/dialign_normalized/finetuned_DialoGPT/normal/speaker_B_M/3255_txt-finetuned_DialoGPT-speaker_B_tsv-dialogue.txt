A|38| B: we _have_ [just] had [that] law _i think_ about [a] year maybe [a] year [and] [a] half here in texas 
B|39| M: uh-uh . [oh] [that's] _good_ . 
A|40| B: [but _uh] _i think_ it's_ [a] [good] idea because [a lot of] [people] still want [to] drive [the] older cars which _you can't_ blame [them] for [that] 
B|41| M: _yeah ._
