A|98| B: [and] [this is] [the] [man] [that] _was_ [in] front [of] [you] ? 
B|99| M: [yeah .] [he's a] attorney [in] garland [texas .] 
A|100| B: [oh] [well] [they'll] weed him out . 
B|101| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|102| B: [yeah .] 
B|103| M: [and] [he] [was just] [as] surprised [as] [everybody] [else] [because they all] had [their] had [their] little [uh] pets [and [and] [uh] .] 
A|104| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: "i [said] ""okay [i'll] [let] [you] start . """ 
A|106| B: [well] _not_ necessarily 
B|107| M: [but] [if] [i] did [i] _would_ [be a] very very unhappy person . 
A|108| B: [but] _there's_ probably something [else] [that] might make [you] . [because] [you] could [know] _about_ [you] could [know] _about_ [the] crime [but] _not_ necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury [you know] _not_ [be] accepted [for] [the] jury . 
B|109| M: uh-uh . uh-hue [. [uh] [i] think] [there's] [a lot of] [things] [that] [can] [be] done _about [it_ [.] [i] don't [know] [i] just] [think] [it's] [a] very complex thing . 
A|110| B: [i mean] pretty much [a lot of] _people_ [would] [know] [about it] [you know] [and and] [know] some [of the] different [things] [about it] [but uh] [they] [they] might weed [you] out some other _way_ . [you know] [if] [you] [if] [you] [don't] believe [like] [if] [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and _and] you_ [don't] believe [in] [if] [you] [don't] believe [in] death penalty you're _not_ [going to] [be] picked [at all .] [so but] 
B|111| M: [well] [that's] [that that] [would] [be] true [. i mean] [you can't] _say_ _that uh_ 
A|112| B: [yeah] [so] see [there] [there] [they] [would] _have_ [a] doubt [about] [you] [that] [you know] 
B|113| M: [right] . 
A|114| B: [because] [if] [that's] what [if] [that's] what [the] punishment [is] [in] [that] [in] [that] instance [then] you're always [going to] [say] [you know] _not_ you're you're _not_ [going to] want [to] _have_ him _have_ [that uh] [that] punishment . [so] 
B|115| M: [well [i] [i don't] [know] [i] think] [that [that] [that] we] [uh [you] know [.] i think] [there's] [i'm] [not] _sure_ [that] [there's] any [way] [that we] [would] [uh] [be able to] completely eliminate [all] [of the] criminals [from] society [. i mean] [if] [if] [we] [just] eliminate [all the] criminals [i mean] [we're] [not] [we're] [just] [going to] solve [the] problem . 
A|116| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|117| M: [and you] [you have to] [you've] [got] [to] get [people] [who] [are] [not] swayed by emotion [or] by [uh _you] really_ [know] [uh] facts [or] whatever [to] [to] [uh .] 
A|118| B: [well] especially with something where [you have to] [you have to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . [you have to] find whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like] [do] [you really] feel [that] [sure] [about]
