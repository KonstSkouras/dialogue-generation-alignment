B|99| M: [yeah .] [he's a] attorney [in] garland , [texas .] 
A|100| B: [oh [,] well] [they'll] , weed him out . 
B|101| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|102| B: [yeah .] 
B|103| M: [and] [he] [was just] [as] surprised [as] [everybody] [else] [, [because] they all] had [their] , had [their] little [, uh ,] pets [and [, and] , [uh] .] 
A|104| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: "i [said] , ""okay , [i'll] [let] [you] start . """

B|107| M: [but] [if] [i] did [, i] _would_ [be a] very , very unhappy person . 
A|108| B: [but] _there's_ probably something [else] [that] might make [you] . [because] [you] could [know] _about_ [, you] could [know] _about_ [the] crime [, but] _not_ necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury [, you know ,] _not_ [be] accepted [for] [the] jury . 
B|109| M: uh-uh . uh-hue [. [uh] [, i] think] [there's] [a lot of] [things] [that] [can] [be] done _about [it_ [.] [i] don't [know] , [i] just] [think] [it's] [a] very complex thing . 
A|110| B: [i mean ,] pretty much [a lot of] _people_ [would] [know] [about it] [, you know [,] [and ,] and] [know] some [of the] different [things] [about it] [but [, uh] ,] [they] , [they] might weed [you] out some other _way_ . [you know _,] if_ _you _,_ if_ [you] [don't] believe [, like] [if] [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and , and] [you] [don't] believe [in] [if] [you] [don't] believe [in] death penalty , you're _not_ [going to] [be] picked [at all .] [so] [but ,] 
B|111| M: [well [,] that's] _, [that ,_ that] [would] [be] true [. [i mean] [,] [you] can't] _say_ [that [,] uh] 
A|112| B: [yeah ,] [so ,] see , [there ,] [there] [they] [would] _have_ [a] doubt [about] _you [,_ that [,] you know ,] 
B|113| M: [right] . 
A|114| B: [because] [if] [that's] what _, if_ [that's] what [the] punishment [is] [in] [that ,] [in] [that] instance , [then] you're always [going to] [say] [, you know ,] _not_ you're , you're _not_ [going to] want [to] _have_ him _have_ [that] [uh [,] that] punishment . [so ,] 
B|115| M: [well [, i] [, i don't] [know] [, i] think] [that] [that , [that] we] [, uh] [you know [.] i think] [there's] [, i'm] [not] _sure_ [that] [there's] any [way] [that we] [would] [, uh] [be able to] completely eliminate [all] [of the] criminals [from] society [. [i mean] [,] if] [, if] [we] [just] eliminate [all the] criminals [, i mean] [we're] [not ,] [we're] [just] [going to] solve [the] problem . 
A|116| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|117| M: [and , [you] [,] [you] have to] , [you've] [got] [to] get [people] [who] [are] [not] swayed by emotion [or] by [, uh , _you] really_ [know [,] uh] facts [or] whatever [to] , [to] [, [uh] .] 
A|118| B: [well ,] especially with something where [you have to] [you have to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . [you have to] find whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like ,] [do] [you really] feel [that] [sure] [about] ,
