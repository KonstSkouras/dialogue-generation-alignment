[so] [we] [don't] [uh] [have] [big] balances on [them] at all now we're we're [you know we] [i] use [it] occasionally [but] [i] pay [it] [right] [off] . we're ... 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [yeah] [you] learn [the] [you know] [the] hard way [you] hate [paying] all [that] interest [and] i've never [been] [one] [to] itemize on [my] income tax [and] never had enough [to] itemize [and] [so [it's] just] [a] [big] chunk [of money] [and you] realize [that] [you're] [not] buying anything on sale [your] [paying] [so] [much] [more] [for] [that] item because you've got finance charge [and] [the] cost [of] having [that] [card] every year which [is] what forty dollars sometimes [just] [to] [have] [the] [card] . 
B|69| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [that's] [a lot of money] [that] [you] went [to] buy this item . 
B|71| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|72| B: [and then you] never feel [like] you've got anything [to] [to] put into savings [or] anything [you're] always [just] [paying] bills [paying] bills [you know] [you don't] feel [that] [you] [have] any extra [to] save . [and i] hate [i] hate living paycheck [to] paycheck [. i like] [to] [have] [a little] there [you know] [that] [i] can save [so] [i] can feel [that] [you [know] if] [something] comes [up] i've got [the] [money] [to] pay [for [it] .]
