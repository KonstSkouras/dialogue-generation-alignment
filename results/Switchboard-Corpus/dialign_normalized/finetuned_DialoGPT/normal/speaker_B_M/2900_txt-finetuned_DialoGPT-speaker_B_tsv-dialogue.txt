B|7| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|8| B: _do_ _they_ wind up with more red tape [and] more problems then ? [yeah] _yeah ._

A|16| B: wow . 
B|17| M: but uh . 
A|18| B: _yeah ._ [well] [i think] part [of] [the] [the] tremendous benefit [of [that] is] [that] _there's_ [so] many [people] who wait now _because _they_ don't have [the_ money] until [you] _know_ [they] [have] no preventative measures [people] um [you] _know_ [just] go on [and] on [and] on .

B|29| M: [oh .] 
A|30| B: [it] was [just] strange . 
B|31| M: [i don't know] [i just] [i don't] [think] [there's] [a] day [that] we can [do] everything [in] [the] world .
