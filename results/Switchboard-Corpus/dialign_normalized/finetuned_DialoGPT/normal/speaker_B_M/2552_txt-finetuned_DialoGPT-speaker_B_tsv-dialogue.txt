B|13| M: _right right ._ 
A|14| B: [right .] [well that's] good . [um] _how_ many _children_ do _you_ [have] ?

B|17| M: uh-uh .

A|20| B: _my_ oldest is _uh_ [four] [and] _my_ youngest is about [to] turn _three_ . _two_ girls [. and] _they_ _are_ [a] handful 
B|21| M: _yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _yes_ . we've _my_ _uh_ [well] [when] we first _got_ married _my_ wife worked _for_ [a] _year_ . [then] we decided [to] [have] [kids] . 
B|23| M: _oh_ [how] neat . 
A|24| B: _and uh_ _she she got_ pregnant [and then] we decided _she_ [would] stay [home] _with_ _the_ [kids] . we [would] make _that_ sacrifice . _it_ is [a] financial sacrifice [to] make because we go _from_ _two_ incomes down [to] one . 
B|25| M: _yeah ._ 
A|26| B: _and uh_ we made _that_ decision _and uh_ _so_ after _she_ [had] _the_ first baby _she_ stayed [home] [. _and] and_ we [had] [a] second baby [and] she's still at [home] 
B|27| M: [uh] . 
A|28| B: [and] _so_ _uh you know_ at work [a] lot _of_ people _are_ _you know_ _i think_ [well] this is [not] [a] normal situation anymore in our in our world we live in . most _of_ _them_ [uh] continue [to] work if _they_ [have] [have] [kids] . 
B|29| M: [yes] _and [i_ _think] that_ [uh] . 
A|30| B: [i] only [have] one other person [i] _know_ in _my_ in _my_ group here [that] works where _the_ wife stays [home] [and] [that's] because _of_ religious values as [well] . _they're_ baptists [and] _they_ [and] _they_ [think] [that's] important . 
B|31| M: _oh_ _really_ . 
A|32| B: _but_ everybody _else_ works [and] _they_ drop their [kids] off at day-care _and and_ leave _them [and_ _i] don't know_ [i] _just_ _don't_ _want_ [i] _just_ _don't_ _want_ strangers raising _my children_ . 
B|33| M: [well] [i] [i] agree [with] [you] . [i] [uh] . 
A|34| B: [right .] 
B|35| M: _and you know_ [they're] [not] used [to] [it] yet . 
A|36| B: [that's] [how] [it] is at our house [when] you're _on_ _the_ phone . [oh] it's open anything _goes_ [when] mom's _on_ _the_ phone 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|39| M: [and] [um] . 
A|40| B: [right .] 
B|41| M: [and then] he [goes] [and and] watches [them] _. and then_ he gives [them] [to] me [and i] pay him rent [and] feed [them _and] everything_ [else] . 
A|42| B: [right .] 
B|43| M: [so] . 
A|44| B: [right .] 
B|45| M: [so] . 
A|46| B: [with] all _the_ yard work [and] things _like_ _that ._ 
B|47| M: [right] [yeah] [and] he's he's working [on] his his master's . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: _but [uh_ you know] he [just] wants [to] get away [from] [the] lawn _and the_ dirt 
A|50| B: [uh-huh .] [right] we feel [that] [you know] [just] spending _time_ together . [you] _don't_ necessarily [have _to] be_ doing anything [you know] [that] costs money or or [you know] [that] requires [you] [to] go [a] [great] distance or anything _like_ _that ._ it's [just] [the] [kids] _like_ [to] being together as [a] _family_ . 
B|51| M: [right .] 
A|52| B: _like_ last saturday we went [had] _some_ errands [to] run [and] [so] we took [the] [kids] [and and] went by [the] farmers market down in in down there in garland . 
B|53| M:  !!! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|54| B: [and] _they_ [had] [a] blast running around [the] farmers market looking at all [the] [you know] [the] food [and] tasting all [the] free samples _they_ were giving _out_ [. and] _they_ [had] [a] little pen there [with] animals in _they_ could pet [you know] 
B|55| M: [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|56| B: [and] _they_ liked [that [.] and then] [on] [the] way [home] we drove by [the] local high school [and] there happened _to be_ an f [a] f [a] [a] future f [a] future farmers [of] america f f [a] going [on] there 
B|57| M: [oh] [that's] [great] . 
A|58| B: [and] _they_ [had] all kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and everything] [you know] all _out_ in this in [the] in this schoolyard there . [so] we [just] said hey let's stop [and [and] the] [kids] _got_ [to] go around [and you know] see pigs [and] animals [and] things _like_ [that] 
B|59| M: [oh] _yeah ._ 
A|60| B: [and and] _for_ [them] _that's wonderful_ [you know] . _they_ _they_ [thought] [it] was [the] greatest fun [you know] [and] [it] didn't cost any money [. _and] [uh_ you] _don't_ [have] quite as much money [when] [when] [the] wife doesn't work . 
B|61| M: _yeah ._ 
A|62| B: [right .] 
B|63| M: [and uh] . 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!!!!! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|66| B: [right .] [right .] [oh] definitely motherhood is devalued in this society . if you're stay at [home] [and] you're [a] mother it's _like_ what [a] waste . people [think] [you know] [you] should _be_ fulfilling yourself 
B|67| M: [uh] 
A|68| B: [and _and] a_ mother isn't an important important thing as as having [a] career 
B|69| M: _right right ._ 
A|70| B: [and and] [that] should _be_ first [and and] _children_ second . [but] _they_ _don't_ [have] kind [of] an what we call an internal perspective [of] things . 
B|71| M: [right .] 
A|72| B: [but] [that] 
B|73| M:  !!! % !! remind me 
A|74| B: no . [right .] 
B|75| M: [i] _want [to_ be] able [to] _spend_ _time with_ [my] [with] [my children] 
A|76| B: [uh] at this point . 
B|77| M: [and i] [i _think] that_ [uh] . 
A|78| B: it's [not] [to] say [that] _some_ day [you] won't go back [to] work . [my] mother's [a] school teacher [and] [when] [when] we started [uh] having [kids] _she_ [had] [to] work _for_ [a] little while [but] [then] _she_ [just] started substituting . 
B|79| M: [oh] . 
A|80| B: [so] _she_ [would] [just] substitute once or twice [a] week [you know] [just] _for_ [that] little extra money [when] we were in school . [then] we [would] [just] [come home] [and] [just] [be] [you know] go [to] [a] neighbor's house _for_ an hour [then] she'd [be] [home] . [but] _she_ wouldn't do [that] every day . 
B|81| M: _yeah ._ 
A|82| B: [but] now [that] [my] [my] [uh] youngest sister's at b y u now [and] [so] _they_ [have] no one at [home] she's back teaching school full [time] now again . [so] if [you know] it's [not] it's [just] [a] temporary thing . 
B|83| M: [oh] [that's wonderful] . 
A|84| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: [but] [um] [she she got] [out] _of it_ [for] [some] reason . 
A|86| B: [yeah .] 
B|87| M: _and and [and_ i] agree [with] [that] [too] [that] [uh] 
A|88| B: [yeah] [yeah] [you] it's it's _hard_ sometimes at work because [you know] people say [oh] we're taking [a] cruise we're going here we're going there [you know] because _they_ [have] [a] lot _more_ money . 
B|89| M: [right .] 
A|90| B: _and a_ lot [of] [them] decide [just] [not] [to] [have] [children] . 
B|91| M: [right .] 
A|92| B: it's it's amazing _they_ either [have] one or none . 
B|93| M: [yeah i] [i think] i've seen [some] [that] [are] [more] [um] [i don't know] [they're] [they] seem [more] [family] oriented . 
A|94| B: [and [and] the] one person [i] [know] [that] _has_ one [they] [they] feel guilty . [she] _has_ this continual guilt trip [that] she's [not] doing [the] [right] thing [and] [so] [on] [uh] [on] weekends [she] [would] [you know] [spend] all [of] her [time with] her [kids] [and] [spend] lots [of] lots [and] lots [of] money . basically [i think] [they] [they] [really] spoil [the] child [to] try [to] overcompensate [for] their guilt feelings . 
B|95| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| B: [and and and] [they] [don't] [want to] [have] anymore [children] because [they] [just] [don't] [think] [you know] [that] [she] doesn't [think] [she] could [be] [a] mother at [home] . [that's not] her bag . [so] [she] [just] doesn't [think that] [she] could [you know] [the] guilt feelings [she] can't deal [with] [with] [it] anymore 
B|97| M: [uh] [that's] true [i] mean [yeah .] 
A|98| B: [so] 
B|99| M: [well] [i] guess [i] [i] [uh] 
A|100| B: [you know] 
B|101| M: [like] [uh] [my] husband [and i] he [has] [a] [three] [year] old [and a] [two] [year] old 
A|102| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [my] wife [uh] likes staying [home] . 
B|103| M: [uh] [that's] [that] [would] [be] [hard] [yeah .] 
A|104| B: [uh] [she] works at [home] [some] though . 
B|105| M: [right .] 
A|106| B: [the] place [she] works [with] worked [with] before [um] worked [out] an arrangement [with] her where [she] can work at [home] part [time] 
B|107| M: [uh] . 
A|108| B: [and] [so] [uh] [that] it's kind [of] [a] seasonal thing . [three] times [a] [year] she's [really] busy doing certain things based [on] [that] kind [of] business 
B|109| M: [uh] . 
A|110| B: [but] [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . [she] likes [to] sew [and] do crafts [and] things [like] [that] [so] [she] enjoys staying at [home] [but uh] [the] money part [of it] is [not] as rewarding obviously [but] there's different rewards [you know] different kinds [of] rewards . 
B|111| M: [yeah .] 
A|112| B: [right [right] [right .] [and] you] [really] [have to] make [uh] quite [a] bit [of] money . [the] wife doesn't make [it] worth [it] [with] [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|113| M: [yeah .] 
A|114| B: [i] [know] there's [you know] [when] [you] adjust your income [for] what [you] put [out] [for] day-care [you know] you're only making [like] five .
