B|21| M: _yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _yes_ . we've _, _my_ _,_ uh [,_ _well] ,_ [when] we first _got_ married _, my_ wife worked _for_ [a] _year_ . [then] we decided [to] [have] [kids] . 
B|23| M: _oh [,_ how] neat . 
A|24| B: _and _, uh_ _,_ she , she got_ pregnant [and then] we decided _she_ [would] stay [home] _with_ _the_ [kids] . we [would] make _that_ sacrifice . _it_ is [a] financial sacrifice [to] make because we go _from_ _two_ incomes down [to] one . 
B|25| M: _yeah ._ 
A|26| B: _and _, uh_ ,_ we made _that_ decision _and _, uh_ ,_ _so_ after _she_ [had] _the_ first baby _, she_ stayed [home] [. _and] , and_ we [had] [a] second baby [and] she's still at [home] 
B|27| M: [uh] . 
A|28| B: [and] _so_ _, uh , you know ,_ at work [a] lot _of_ people _are_ _, you know _,_ i think_ [well] this is [not] [a] normal situation anymore in our , in our world we live in . most _of_ _them_ _, uh ,_ continue [to] work if _they_ [have] , [have] [kids] . 
B|29| M: [yes [,] and] [i _think] _that_ [,_ uh] . 
A|30| B: [i] only [have] one other person [i] _know_ in _my ,_ in _my_ group here [that] works where _the_ wife stays [home [,] and] [that's] because _of_ religious values as [well] . _they're_ baptists [and] _they_ [, and] _they_ [think] [that's] important . 
B|31| M: _oh ,_ _really_ . 
A|32| B: _but_ everybody _else_ works [and] _they_ drop their [kids] off at day-care _and , and_ leave _them _and_ _,_ i don't know _,_ i_ _just_ _don't_ _want_ _, i_ _just_ _don't_ _want_ strangers raising _my children_ . 
B|33| M: [well [,] i] [, i] agree [with] [you] . [i] [, uh] . 
A|34| B: [right .] 
B|35| M: _and , you know ,_ [they're] [not] used [to] [it] yet . 
A|36| B: [that's] [how] [it] is at our house [when] you're _on_ _the_ phone . [oh ,] it's open , anything _goes_ [when] mom's _on_ _the_ phone 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|39| M: [and _,] um_ . 
A|40| B: [right .] 
B|41| M: [and then] he [goes] [and , and] watches [them] _. and then_ he gives [them] [to] me [, and] [i] pay him rent [and] feed [them _and] everything_ [else] . 
A|42| B: [right .] 
B|43| M: [so] . 
A|44| B: [right .] 
B|45| M: [so] . 
A|46| B: [with] all _the_ yard work [and] things _like_ _that ._ 
B|47| M: [right _,] yeah [,_ and] he's , he's working [on] his , his master's . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: _but [, uh ,_ you know ,] he [just] wants [to] get away [from] [the] lawn _and the_ dirt 
A|50| B: [uh-huh .] [right ,] we feel [that [,] you know ,] [just] spending _time_ together . [you] _don't_ necessarily [have _to] be_ doing anything [, you know _,] that_ costs money or , or [, you know _,] that_ requires [you] [to] go [a] [great] distance or anything _like_ _that ._ it's [just] [the] [kids] _like_ [to] , being together as [a] _family_ . 
B|51| M: [right .] 
A|52| B: _like_ last saturday we went , [had] _some_ errands [to] run [and] [so] we took [the] [kids] [and , and] went by [the] farmers market down in , in , down there in garland . 
B|53| M:  !!! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|54| B: [and] _they_ [had] [a] blast running around [the] farmers market looking at all [the] [, you know ,] [the] food [and] tasting all [the] free samples _they_ were giving _out_ [. and] _they_ [had] [a] little pen there [with] animals in _they_ could pet [, you know ,] 
B|55| M: [oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|56| B: [and] _they_ liked [that [.] and then] [on] [the] way [home] we drove by [the] local high school [and] there happened _to be_ an f [a] , f [a] [a] , future f [a] , future farmers [of] america , f f [a] going [on] there , 
B|57| M: [oh [,] that's] [great] . 
A|58| B: [and] _they_ [had] all kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and everything] [, you know ,] all _out_ in this , in [the] , in this schoolyard there . [so] we [just] said , hey , let's stop [and] [and the] [kids] _got_ [to] go around [and , you know ,] see pigs [and] animals [and] things _like_ [that ,] 
B|59| M: [oh _,] _yeah_ ._ 
A|60| B: [and , and] _for_ [them] _that's wonderful_ [, you know] . _they_ _, they_ [thought] [it] was [the] greatest fun [, you know [,] and] [it] didn't cost any money [. _and] [, uh_ , you] _don't_ [have] quite as much money [when ,] [when] [the] wife doesn't work . 
B|61| M: _yeah ._ 
A|62| B: [right .] 
B|63| M: [and , uh] . 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!!!!! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|66| B: [right .] [right .] [oh ,] definitely motherhood is devalued in this society . if you're , stay at [home] [and] you're [a] mother , it's _like_ what [a] waste . people [think] [, you know [,] you] should _be_ fulfilling yourself 
B|67| M: [uh ,] 
A|68| B: [and , _and] a_ mother isn't an important important thing as , as having [a] career 
B|69| M: _right , right ._ 
A|70| B: [and , and] [that] should _be_ first [and , and] _children_ second . [but] _they_ _don't_ [have] kind [of] an , what we call an internal perspective [of] things . 
B|71| M: [right .] 
A|72| B: [but] [that ,] 
B|73| M:  !!! % !! remind me 
A|74| B: no . [right .] 
B|75| M: [i] _want [to_ be] able [to] _spend_ _time with_ [my _,] with_ [my children] , 
A|76| B: [uh ,] at this point . 
B|77| M: [and] [i] [, i _think] [that_ [,] uh] . 
A|78| B: it's [not] [to] say [that] _some_ day [you] won't go back [to] work . [my] mother's [a] school teacher [and] [when ,] [when] we started [, uh ,] having [kids _,] she_ [had] [to] work _for_ [a] little while , [but] [then] _she_ [just] started substituting . 
B|79| M: [oh] . 
A|80| B: [so] _she_ [would] [just] substitute once or twice [a] week [, you know ,] [just] _for_ [that] little extra money [when] we were in school . [then] we [would] [just] [come home] [and] [just] [be] [, you know ,] go [to] [a] neighbor's house _for_ an hour , [then] she'd [be] [home] . [but] _she_ wouldn't do [that] every day . 
B|81| M: _yeah ._ 
A|82| B: [but] now [that] [my [,] [my] [,] uh ,] youngest sister's at b y u now [, and] [so] _they_ [have] no one at [home ,] she's back teaching school full [time] now , again . [so] if [, you know ,] it's [not] , it's [just] [a] temporary thing . 
B|83| M: [oh [,] [that's] wonderful] . 
A|84| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: _but _,_ um [,_ she , she got] [out] _of it_ [for] [some] reason . 
A|86| B: [yeah .] 
B|87| M: _and , and , and_ [i] agree [with] [that [,] too] _, that [,_ uh] 
A|88| B: [yeah [,] yeah [,] you] , it's , it's _hard_ sometimes at work because [, you know ,] people say , [oh ,] we're taking [a] cruise , we're going here , we're going there [, you know] because _they_ [have] [a] lot _more_ money . 
B|89| M: [right .] 
A|90| B: _and a_ lot [of] [them] decide [just] [not] [to] [have] [children] . 
B|91| M: [right .] 
A|92| B: it's , it's amazing _, they_ either [have] one or none . 
B|93| M: [yeah , i] [, i think] i've seen [some] [that] [are] [more] _, um [,_ i don't know ,] [they're] [, they] seem [more] [family] oriented . 
A|94| B: [and , [and] the] one person [i] [know] [that] _has_ one [, they] [, they] feel guilty . [she] _has_ this continual guilt trip [that] she's [not] doing [the] [right] thing [, and] [so] [on] [, uh ,] [on] weekends [she] [would] [, you know ,] [spend] all [of] her [time with] her [kids] [and] [spend] lots [of] , lots [and] lots [of] money . basically [, i think] [they] [, they] [really] spoil [the] child , [to] try [to] overcompensate [for] their guilt feelings . 
B|95| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| B: [and , and , and] [they] [don't] [want to] [have] anymore [children] because [they] [just] [don't] [think] [, you know [,] that [,] she] doesn't [think] [she] could [be] [a] mother at [home] . [that's not] her bag . [so] [she] [just] doesn't [think that] [she] could [, you know ,] [the] guilt feelings [, she] can't deal [with] [with] [it] anymore 
B|97| M: [uh [,] that's] true [, i] mean [, [yeah] .] 
A|98| B: [so] , 
B|99| M: [well [,] i] guess [i] [, i] [, uh] 
A|100| B: [you know ,] 
B|101| M: [like] [, uh [,] my] husband [and] [i] , he [has] [a] [three] [year] old [and a] [two] [year] old , 
A|102| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah [,] my] wife [, uh ,] likes staying [home] . 
B|103| M: [uh [,] that's] [, that] [would] [be] [hard] [, [yeah] .] 
A|104| B: [uh [,] she] works at [home] [some] , though . 
B|105| M: [right .] 
A|106| B: [the] place [she] works [with] , worked [with] before [, um ,] worked [out] an arrangement [with] her where [she] can work at [home ,] part [time] , 
B|107| M: [uh] . 
A|108| B: [and] [so] [, uh [,] that ,] it's kind [of] [a] seasonal thing . [three] times [a] [year] she's [really] busy doing certain things based [on] [that] kind [of] business , 
B|109| M: [uh] . 
A|110| B: [but] [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . [she] likes [to] sew [and] do crafts [and] things [like] [that] [so] [she] enjoys staying at [home ,] [but , uh ,] [the] money part [of it] is [not] as rewarding , obviously , [but] there's different rewards [, you know ,] different kinds [of] rewards . 
B|111| M: [yeah .] 
A|112| B: [right , [right] , [right .] and] [you] [really] [have to] make [, uh ,] quite [a] bit [of] money . [the] wife doesn't make [it] worth [it] [, with] [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|113| M: [yeah .] 
A|114| B: [i] [know] there's [, you know ,] [when] [you] adjust your income [for] what [you] put [out] [for] day-care [, you know ,] you're only making [like] five .
