A|7| B: [that's] rather interesting .

B|12| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|13| B: we _don't_ use [the] [radio] [as] [a] wake up we [have] our [a] [television] connected to [a] [uh] [uh] electronic alarm [uh] system [that] kicks in 
B|14| M: _oh_ [okay .] 
A|15| B: [and] [it] comes [on] _with_ _c_ n n in [the] morning . 
B|16| M: _oh_ [okay .] 
A|17| B: [that] we we wake up to [television] [news] _and uh_ [uh] shower [and] dress [and] whatever to [that] [and] then _because_ [of the] fact [that] my wife _and i_ ride to work together [uh] in [a] car we we chat at each other rather than than something else . 
B|18| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|19| B: [uh] [and] occasionally what we'll each [do] depending [on] whoever _is_ driving _is_ [have] [the] newspaper _sort of_ [on] our lap [on] [the] way in in [the] car [so] we [have] [the] advantage [of] being able to [uh] read [and] drive although there seems to be [from] what _i've_ seen [on] [the] freeway recently [that] [a] fair number [of] people are reading [and] driving 
B|20| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|21| B: [so] we we [rely] pretty pretty heavily _i think_ [on] [a] combination [of the] [of the] two [. i] also [uh] use [uh] newsweek magazine . [uh] 
B|22| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|23| B: we tend to alternate between newsweek [and] time [and] whatever happens to be _the [the_ uh] [news] magazine [of the] year for _us ._ 
B|24| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|25| B: _and uh_ [i] read sporadically [of] commentary [and] [a] couple [of] other [you know] trade magazines _and uh_ [uh] such [as] [that uh] where [i] might read _the the_ occasional social [and] even current event commentaries [and] [and] everything [as] diverse [as] [a] _c_ m to [uh] [uh] some [of [the] uh] some [of the] other tabloids [i] [get] . _so uh_ [i] guess [i] use [about] eighty percent written _is_ probably my input [and] twenty percent [uh] [television . _i] i think_ [i] respect [the] [from] [a] journalistic perspective current events . 
B|26| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|27| B: _i've_ always said [that] [it] [it's] _really_ [not] interesting unless [it's] three weeks old [and] found its way into [a] [news] weekly headline . 
B|28| M: _yeah_ . 
A|29| B: [uh] other than [that] [it] was [a] at best . 
B|30| M: _yeah_ . 
A|31| B: [uh] we're probably [not] thrilled _with_ our only newspaper [that] we [have] in raleigh . there there are other [uh] [uh] _i'm not_ _sure_ what [you] [would] call them [they] [the] small [uh] competing independent _sort of_ [newspapers] . _little_ small weekly things [but] there's only [one] daily [uh] called [the] [news] [and] observer fondly referred to here by some [as] [the uh] [uh] sometimes [the] noise [and] observer . 
B|32| M: _yeah_ . 
A|33| B: [uh] [it] depends . [it] [it's] has decent national coverage [but] has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in [the] southern history [and] [the] fact [that] this _is_ [a] democratic state . 
B|34| M:  !!!!!!!.!! iful !! 
A|35| B: _and uh_ consequently everything _is_ filtered through [that uh] republican democratic _sort of_ glass almost unnecessarily 
B|36| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|37| B: [so] . 
B|38| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|39| B: [yeah] we we [have] _that is_ [uh] [as] [a] matter [of] fact [they] update [it] once [a] week _with_ [a] special section we [and] we pay [it] _sort of_ glancing nod . we [uh] [have] [a] _very_ good friend who _is_ [uh] tapped into [the] city planning structure . [uh] our developer architect friend [and] 
B|40| M: _oh_ [really] . 
A|41| B: right . [so] _i think_ we find out what's happening in [the] city [uh] [on] [a] fairly frequent basis over [a] over [a] gin [and] tonic _sort of_ _thing_ . 
B|42| M: _uh-huh ._ uh-hue .

B|50| M: [yeah] . 
A|51| B: [okay .] 
B|52| M: [it's] [it's] kind [of] like [c] nn [you know] [sort _of] a_ [little] bit _different_ . 
A|53| B: [okay .] 
B|54| M: [and i] [and [i] i think] [it's] [because] [the uh] [the the] [i] [don't] [know] [i've] [i'm not] [really] [sure] [uh .]

B|60| M: [yeah] . 
A|61| B: [uh] almost an addition [uh] [and] [and] [and] we could equate or relate relay [well] to some [of the] newspaper [and] [television] articles [about] [the] fact [that] people where having this problem in in unhooking uncoupling [from the] events [and] going [on] _with_ their . [so] 
B|62| M: [well] [that's] true [that] [that is] true . uh-hue . 
A|63| B: instead [of] being watching [the] missiles [and] being glued to [the] tube or whatever . [uh] [and] [because] [of] [that] we began towards [the] middle [and] [of the] war [i] guess [about] two [and] [a] half or three weeks in we began to restrict our [news] almost deliberately where we [would] [uh] [watch] [uh] fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which [would] be national [news] or our local [news] . we [would] [watch c] n n until six thirty then we [would] [watch] [uh] [a] rotating network [news] [of] either [uh] [a] b [c] [c] b s or n b [c] [and] we we [sort of] just rotated around [the] dial each night [a] [different] [one] . 
B|64| M: [oh] [yeah] [i think] _that's that's_ _the same_ [thing] [with] [us .] we've [uh] 
A|65| B: [and] then we [would] turn [the television] off [and] we were [sort of] limiting or dieting ourselves [on] [on] [news] [that] way . [and] then we [would] [do a] similar [thing] [uh] at [uh] ten forty-five [because] [uh] [c] n n [would] be wrapping their hourly coverage up [and] then we [would get] [the] local coverage [uh] [and] then [i think] [the] local coverage we [would] tend to [watch] [the same] station [that] [would] [would] [have] [better] state coverage rather than local coverage . [uh] three [of the] networks here [on] their local [news] [uh] [that] if if [you] wish to listen at eleven o'clock [you] can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what . [from] whom . 
B|66| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|67| B: [and] [that] was [the] [sort of] [thing] [that] [i would] say [is] [the] best mumblex [and not] [news] 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| B: unless there's some trend or something [that] says jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever . [uh] [that's that's] [sort of] [more] [of] [of a] pattern [news] .
