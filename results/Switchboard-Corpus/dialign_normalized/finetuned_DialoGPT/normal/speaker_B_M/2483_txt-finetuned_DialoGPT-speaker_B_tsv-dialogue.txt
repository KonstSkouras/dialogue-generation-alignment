B|50| M: [yeah] . 
A|51| B: [okay .] 
B|52| M: [it's [,] it's] kind [of] like [c] nn [, you know ,] [sort _of] a_ [little] bit _different_ . 
A|53| B: [okay .] 
B|54| M: [and [i] [,] [and] [i] , i think] [it's] [because] [the , uh] [the , the [,] i] [don't] [know ,] [i've] [, i'm not] [really] [sure] [, [uh] .] 
A|55| B: [oh _,] that_ didn't [, [uh] ,]

A|57| B: [uh-huh .]

[uh ,] we almost live [and [,] and] breathed [it] for , [because] during [the] war itself to [the] point where we began to [sort of] [have] household pact [of] lets turn [the] war off [and] [get] something done . 
B|60| M: [yeah] . 
A|61| B: [uh ,] almost an addition [, [uh] [,] [and] [,] [and] [,] and] we could equate or relate relay [well] to some [of the] newspaper [and] [television] articles [about] [the] fact [that] people where having this problem in , in unhooking , uncoupling [from the] events [, and] going [on] _with_ their . [so ,] 
B|62| M: [well] _, that's_ true [, [that] [,] that is] true . uh-hue . 
A|63| B: instead [of] being , watching [the] missiles [and] being glued to [the] tube or whatever . [uh [,] and] [because] [of] [that] we began towards [the] middle [and] [of the] war [, i] guess [about] two [and] [a] half or three weeks in , we began to restrict our [news] almost deliberately where we [would] [, [uh] ,] [watch] [, [uh] ,] fifteen minutes before , fifteen minutes after six our time which [would] be national [news] , or our local [news] . we [would] [watch c] n n until six thirty , then we [would] [watch] [, [uh] ,] [a] rotating network [news] [of] either [, [uh] ,] [a] b [c] , [c] b s , or n b [c] [and] we , we [sort of] just rotated around [the] dial each night [a] [different] [one] . 
B|64| M: [oh ,] [yeah [,] i think] _that's , that's_ _the same_ [thing] [with] [us .] we've [, uh] 
A|65| B: [and] then we [would] turn [the television] off [and] we were [sort of] limiting or dieting ourselves [on] , [on] [news] [that] way . [and ,] then we [would] [do a] similar [thing] [, [uh] ,] at [uh ,] ten forty-five [because] [, [uh] ,] [c] n n [would] be wrapping their hourly coverage up [and] then we [would get] [the] local coverage [, [uh] [,] and] then [i think] [the] local coverage we [would] tend to [watch] [the same] station [that] [would] , [would] [have] [better] state coverage rather than local coverage . [uh ,] three [of the] networks here , [on] their local [news] [, [uh] [,] that] if , if [you] wish to listen at eleven o'clock [you] can find out who raped who , murdered who , or stole what . [from] whom . 
B|66| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|67| B: [and [,] that] was [the] [sort of] [thing] [that] [i would] say [is] [the] best mumblex [and not] [news] 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| B: unless there's some trend or something [that] says , jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever . [uh [,] [that's] , that's] [sort of] [more] [of] , [of a] pattern [news] .
