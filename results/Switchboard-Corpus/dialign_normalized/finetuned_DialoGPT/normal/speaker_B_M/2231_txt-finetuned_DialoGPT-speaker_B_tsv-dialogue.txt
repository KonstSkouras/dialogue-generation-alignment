B|23| M: _right_ .

B|27| M: _right_ . 
A|28| B: _yeah ._ _i'd_ [like] _to see_ [the] death penalty more _as_ [a] deterrent [, i think] _people_ [know] [that] [nobody] _, that_ [it] doesn't [, you know _,] it's_ _not a_ deterrent [right] _now_ , because _it's_ _not really_ effective .

B|31| M: [right] . 
A|32| B: [this] _is_ [what's [going] to] _happen_ .

A|34| B: [and [,] i mean [,] it] sounds horrible . [it , i] hear myself saying [this [,] and [,] but [,] i ,] [don't know] [what] else [to do] with [some] [of] these _people _,_ _that_ are ,_ 
B|35| M: [well ,] [they're] [not] , 
A|36| B: because [they] let them back [out] again [, [and] _they] do_ [the] same _thing_ over [, and] over , again , 
B|37| M: [i know] . [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: then [they] put them back [in] jail [, [and] _they] _get_ out_ [, and] [and] more [and] more innocent _people_ [are] hurt or killed 
B|39| M: _yes ._ 
A|40| B: [and] these guys [just] [are on] [the] endless merry-go-round [in the] legal system . 
B|41| M: _yes_ [, [they] do] [, they] [are ,] [they're] [just] getting , 
A|42| B: _and it's_ [like] [i] said at our expense . 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: [yes .] 
B|45| M: [so] [, [it's] [,] [it] [,] it] [can] [happen] [to] anyone [and it's] happened [to] me , _too ._ 
A|46| B: [i [know] [, i] , you] read [about] [it] [in the] paper , every day , somebody who's done [this ,] or [that ,] [something] [really] horrible 
B|47| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| B: [and they] [just] _get_ away with [it , and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: [right] . 
A|50| B: [yeah [.] [i] think] [i think] texas _is_ texas , [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] still [have] [the] death penalty [, and [i] think] [, [i] know] california had [it] [for] [a] long time [, and] then _they [,_ uh ,] took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: uh-hope . 
A|52| B: [and] _people_ [like] charles manson [, and , and] [some] [of] these _other people ,_ who were sentenced [to] death at [the] time [they] repealed [the] death penalty , were sentenced [to] life [in] prison [, and] [are] _now_ , _now_ [that] even though california has reinstated [the] death penalty , [for] whatever various crimes . [the] _people_ who were there originally , when _they ,_ when [they] changed [the laws] [to] revoke [the] death penalty , [are] still [in] there [for] , [are] [in] prison , [in] quote , [for] life [, and , and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] parole , [some] [of] them , [like] manson who's come [up] [you know] 
B|53| M: [uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|54| B: [it's] been denied fortunately [but ,] 
B|55| M: _yeah [,_ that's] true . 
A|56| B: [yeah .] 
B|57| M: [and _it's] _a_ , [a_ [,] [it's] [,] [it] _was] [a_ [,] you know [,] it] [is] [a] tough issue [, but [,] uh [,] you] [can] [see] [that] [there's] _a lot of_ [people] [that are [,] you] [just] _have to_ accept [it , and] [that's] [not a] bad [thing] . 
A|58| B: [well ,] [the] jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him [to] death 
B|59| M: _yeah , yeah ._ 
A|60| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] his thousandth [and] one appeal , [the] [state] [of] california revoked [the] law [in the] early seventies [, and] then [they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty didn't [go] back _. [you_ know] ? 
B|61| M: huh . 
A|62| B: _it seems like_ [a lot of] times [the] law [is] , [is] totally [on] [the] criminal side [, and , and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] [not] [as] [, [it] seems like] [they're] [not really] making any effort [to] protect [the] victim . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] [and] [the] , [the laws are] all , [the] rules . [some] [of] [the] things [that] [would] make sense [to ,] [to] tell [the] jury _, that_ [this ,] [this] guy has [a , a] prior criminal history [, you know ,] where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: [uh ,] 
A|68| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] [this] one trial [, [and] they] [don't] finds anything [out] [about] [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] [now] . 
A|70| B: [and] [so] [they] [say , [well] ,] [this] [is] [, you know [, i] , i don't know] if [they] [say] [it's] [the] first time offense or whatever [, but] [they] give him [a] lighter sentence , thinking he's [not a] habitual criminal . 
B|71| M: [yeah .] 
A|72| B: [yeah , yeah .] [well ,] [to] [some] extent if [they] [would] [do] [something] with [some] [of] those [people] . [but] [that] [seems] [to be] [a] good way _to get_ off [for] [a lot of] them [too .] 
B|73| M: [i don't] [, i mean [,] [they] [,] they get] [so] easily swayed _by_ emotion . 
A|74| B: [they] plead insanity 
B|75| M: [yeah .] 
A|76| B: [and] then three [years] later [they're] cured [, and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: uh-hue . 
A|78| B: [i mean [,] [it's] a] [it's a] scary [world] [out] there anymore , where _your_ afraid [to [go] out] , 
B|79| M: uh-hue . 
A|80| B: [i [know] ,] [in] , [in the] dallas metroplex area [, i don't] [go out] hardly if [i don't] [have to] at night [by] myself 
B|81| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| B: [and i , i] certainly [, i , i] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way when [i] [was] younger . 
B|83| M: [uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|84| B: we could [go] around [, and ,] boy [and ,] 
B|85| M: [it's [,] [it's] [,] uh [,] it] [is] nice [to [get] out] [and] [see] [other people [,] you know] [. you] [, you] [don't] feel [like] you're alone [, but] [you] feel [like] [your] , [your] , you're [not] quite [as] _, as_ much [of] [a] person [, and] [you] don [, you] [have] [other] responsibilities . 
A|86| B: [yes .] ever [, you can't] even , when [i] [was a] kid [, i would] run between my neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and [,] as] long [as] my mom had [a] general idea where [i] [was] [and i] [was] back [on] [the] time , 
B|87| M: [uh [,] that's] true . 
A|88| B: [and] [now] [i don't] let my kids [out] [of] [the] front yard _, [that_ i] [can't] [see] them . 
B|89| M: [uh [,] that's] [a [,] [that ,] that] [is] [a] problem . 
A|90| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [but [,] uh ,] 
A|92| B: [well ,] good talking [to] [you] [too .] _bye_ ,
