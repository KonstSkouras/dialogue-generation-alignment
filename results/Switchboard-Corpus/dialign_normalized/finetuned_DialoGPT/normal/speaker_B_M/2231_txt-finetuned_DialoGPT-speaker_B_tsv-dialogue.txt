A|4| B: _that's_ [i agree] with [that] completely [. _i] know_ we [don't] _have_ enough prisons [but] there has got [to be] _some_ kind _of_ punishment [for] these _people_ . 
B|5| M: _right_ . 
A|6| B: because if [they] turn around [they] _can_ _get_ away _they get_ away with _it _and_ _they_ get_ away with _it _and_ _they_ get_ away with _it and_ then _they do_ _something_ worse

A|18| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|19| M: _and _and_ and_ _you know_ _they're out_ _in the_ real _world_ [and] _they're_ spending _so_ much money [and they] [have] no concept [of] _what's going_ [on] _you know_ . 
A|20| B: [and and] [be] paroled [and and] [have] served [the] sentence 
B|21| M: _right_ . 
A|22| B: _that's_ [what] _that's_ [what] _people_ face with [that] choice . one _thing_ [i] [really] hate _is_ [they] [don't] explain [to] [the] jurors [in a] [in a] trial [in a] capital murder trial or [in] cases [of] rape or [in] different things _that are_ [so] horrible [what] [it] means when [they] sentence them [to] [you know] they'll sentence them [to] ninety [years] [and _say] that_ _it's_ [you know] [that] _it's_ [going to] [you know] 
B|23| M: _right_ . 
A|24| B: [that] [should] [be] life [but] instead [in] [in] given [the] choice [of] either sentencing [to] death or sentencing [to] life they'll give them ninety [years] [in] prison or _something_ [and] then turn around [in] thirty [years] [that] [you know] [and] less [they're out] . 
B|25| M: _right_ . 
A|26| B: even if if [they're] even [in] [that] long . or [they] appeal [and] then _they get_ an appeal [that] says _it was_ [you know] an unjust amount [of] time an extraordinary long length or _something_ . 
B|27| M: _right_ . 
A|28| B: _yeah ._ _i'd_ [like] _to see_ [the] death penalty more _as_ [a] deterrent [i think] _people_ [know] [that] [nobody] [that] [it] doesn't [you know] _it's_ _not a_ deterrent [right] _now_ because _it's_ _not really_ effective . 
B|29| M: no . 
A|30| B: _there's_ [should] [be] [you know] [this] [for] [this] crime [this] _is_ [the] penalty _. you_ killed someone [you know] [in] cold blood or whatever . 
B|31| M: [right] . 
A|32| B: [this] _is_ [what's [going] to] _happen_ . 
B|33| M: _i _i_ i don't know_ i've i'm [not] sure i'm _i mean_ [i] [see] [some] aspects [to] [it] [but] [i'd] _i would_ [say _that] i_ don [i] wouldn't want [to see] [it] [you] [you] _have to_ [have] [a] _state_ [that] does [something] [like] [that] . 
A|34| B: [and [i] mean] [it] sounds horrible . [it i] hear myself saying [this] [and] [but [i] don't know] [what] else [to do] with [some] [of] these _people that are_ 
B|35| M: [well] [they're] [not] 
A|36| B: because [they] let them back [out] again [and _they] do_ [the] same _thing_ over [and] over again 
B|37| M: [i know] . [uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: then [they] put them back [in] jail [and _they] _get_ out [and_ and] more [and] more innocent _people_ [are] hurt or killed 
B|39| M: _yes ._ 
A|40| B: [and] these guys [just] [are on] [the] endless merry-go-round [in the] legal system . 
B|41| M: _yes_ [they do] [they] [are] [they're] [just] getting 
A|42| B: _and it's_ [like] [i] said at our expense . 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: [yes .] 
B|45| M: [so] [it's] [it] [it] [can] [happen] [to] anyone [and it's] happened [to] me _too ._ 
A|46| B: [i [know] [i] you] read [about] [it] [in the] paper every day somebody who's done [this] or [that] [something] [really] horrible 
B|47| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| B: [and they] [just] _get_ away with [it and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: [right] . 
A|50| B: [yeah [.] [i] think] [i think] texas _is_ texas [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] still [have] [the] death penalty [and [i] think] [i know] california had [it] [for] [a] long time [and] then [they] [uh] took [it] off [the] books [they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: uh-hope . 
A|52| B: [and] _people_ [like] charles manson [and and] [some] [of] these _other people_ who were sentenced [to] death at [the] time [they] repealed [the] death penalty were sentenced [to] life [in] prison [and] [are] _now_ _now_ [that] even though california has reinstated [the] death penalty [for] whatever various crimes . [the] _people_ who were there originally when [they] when [they] changed [the laws] [to] revoke [the] death penalty [are] still [in] there [for] [are] [in] prison [in] quote [for] life [and and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] parole [some] [of] them [like] manson who's come [up] [you know] 
B|53| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|54| B: [it's] been denied fortunately [but] 
B|55| M: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|56| B: [yeah .] 
B|57| M: [and _it's] _a_ _a_ it's_ [it _was] a_ [you know] [it] [is] [a] tough issue [but] [uh] [you] [can] [see] [that] [there's] _a lot of_ [people that are] [you] [just] _have to_ accept [it and] [that's] [not a] bad [thing] . 
A|58| B: [well] [the] jury [that] sentenced him sentenced him [to] death 
B|59| M: _yeah yeah ._ 
A|60| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] his thousandth [and] one appeal [the] [state] [of] california revoked [the] law [in the] early seventies [and] then [they] reinstated [it] later [but] [the] penalty didn't [go] back _. [you_ know] ? 
B|61| M: huh . 
A|62| B: _it seems like_ [a lot of] times [the] law [is] [is] totally [on] [the] criminal side [and and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
B|63| M: [yeah .] 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [it's] [just] [it's] [just] [not] [as] [it seems like] [they're] [not really] making any effort [to] protect [the] victim . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] [and] [the] [the laws are] all [the] rules . [some] [of] [the] things [that] [would] make sense [to] [to] tell [the] jury [that] [this] [this] guy has [a a] prior criminal history [you know] where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: [uh] 
A|68| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] [this] one trial [and they] [don't] finds anything [out] [about] [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] [now] . 
A|70| B: [and] [so] [they] [say well] [this] [is] [you know [i] i don't know] if [they] [say] [it's] [the] first time offense or whatever [but] [they] give him [a] lighter sentence thinking he's [not a] habitual criminal . 
B|71| M: [yeah .] 
A|72| B: [yeah yeah .] [well] [to] [some] extent if [they] [would] [do] [something] with [some] [of] those [people] . [but] [that] [seems] [to be] [a] good way _to get_ off [for] [a lot of] them [too .] 
B|73| M: [i don't] [i mean] [they] [they get] [so] easily swayed _by_ emotion . 
A|74| B: [they] plead insanity 
B|75| M: [yeah .] 
A|76| B: [and] then three [years] later [they're] cured [and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: uh-hue . 
A|78| B: [i mean] [it's [a] [it's] a] scary [world] [out] there anymore where _your_ afraid [to [go] out] 
B|79| M: uh-hue . 
A|80| B: [i know] [in] [in the] dallas metroplex area [i don't] [go out] hardly if [i don't] [have to] at night [by] myself 
B|81| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| B: [and i i] certainly [i i] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] texas [and] [it] wasn't [that] way when [i] [was] younger . 
B|83| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|84| B: we could [go] around [and] boy [and] 
B|85| M: [it's] [it's] [uh] [it] [is] nice [to [get] out and] [see] [other people] [you know] [. you] [you] [don't] feel [like] you're alone [but] [you] feel [like] [your] [your] you're [not] quite [as] [as] much [of] [a] person [and] [you] don [you] [have] [other] responsibilities . 
A|86| B: [yes .] ever [you can't] even when [i] [was a] kid [i would] run between my neighbors three [and] four blocks sometimes [and] [as] long [as] my mom had [a] general idea where [i] [was] [and i] [was] back [on] [the] time 
B|87| M: [uh] [that's] true . 
A|88| B: [and] [now] [i don't] let my kids [out] [of] [the] front yard [that i] [can't] [see] them . 
B|89| M: [uh] [that's] [a] [that that] [is] [a] problem . 
A|90| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [but] [uh] 
A|92| B: [well] good talking [to] [you] [too .] _bye_ 
B|93| M: _bye ._ 
A|94| B: [bye .]
