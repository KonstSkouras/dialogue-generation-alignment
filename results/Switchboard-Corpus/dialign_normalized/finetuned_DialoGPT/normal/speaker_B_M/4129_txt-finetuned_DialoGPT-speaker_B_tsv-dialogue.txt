A|14| B: elementary _school_ . 
B|15| M: _oh_ okay . 
A|16| B: _and_ _in_ [a] very poor section _of_ town with predominantly anglo kids . _and i_ see kids already _that_ are going [to be] criminals _in_ spite _of_ everything _we_ can _do_ 
B|17| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hum . 
A|18| B: _and_ see _i'm_ afraid [i think] if _we_ [would] take _the_ equivalent amount _of_ money _and_ invest [it] _in_ young people _that_ [i] mean course _you_ couldn't _do_ _that_ because _you_ got _to do_ something with _the_ ones _that_ are already _there_ 
B|19| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: _but i think_ _we_ [would] make [a] bigger investment _in_ kids we'd [have] fewer decisions [to] make . down _the_ road _you _know_ ._ 
B|21| M: [yeah .] 
A|22| B: [oh] [yeah .] 
B|23| M: [uh] [the] _the school system_ [in] dallas [is] so rundown _and _you_ just_ can't seem [to] _get_ around [the] _system ._ 
A|24| B: _well_ _i'm_ _not_ talking about [just] [in] [the school [system] .] 
B|25| M: right right . 
A|26| B: see _i'm_ talking about like [in] [in] [uh] _i'm_ afraid [i think] _that_ _there_ are kids who [just] ought [to be] taken out _of_ their homes [and] reared . [uh i] _know_ [the] institutions _don't_ [work] _that_ _well_ [but] [a] bad day because [i] all these kids through my office . [i] [have] [a] [school] _of_ five hundred [and] thirty-seven kids . 
B|27| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: five hundred _of_ them are good solid kids _and i_ [have] [the] same thirty-seven [in] my office every day . 
B|29| M: [yeah .] 
A|30| B: [and] [a] lot _of_ their parents are totally irresponsible . _some_ _of_ them [in] [the] penal [system .] 
B|31| M: [yeah .] 
A|32| B: [and _you] know_ [you just] see those kids going down [the] road . now _not_ all _of_ them will commit offenses _that_ [have _to] do_ with capital _punishment_ [but] _some_ _of_ them [have] already been [in] youth centers . [and] _that_ kind _of_ thing 
B|33| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: [and] if _we_ had something _to do_ before they [get] [to be] full-blown adult criminals [and] _i'm_ _not_ talking about necessarily [in] [the school system] _i'm_ _not_ _sure_ _that_ [the school system] _should be_ [the] agent _of_ all [the] social action . 
B|35| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| B: [i think] that's one reason _we_ [have] problems [in] schools [uh] [and] _some_ _of_ them are our problems [but] [a] lot _of_ [it's] because everything society wants _we_ are supposed _to do ._ 
B|37| M: [yeah .]

B|39| M: [yeah] [i think] [it's a] [it's] [it] really [is] [a] problem . 
A|40| B: anyway [i] dealt with two or three kids today _that_ are going [to] end up where somebody has making [a] decision _what_ _to do_ with them . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [uh-huh .] _i don't_ _i don't know_ _that_ _there_ [is] _an_ easy solution [but] if [you] could find [a] way [to] prevent _some_ _of_ [it] [and] _i'm_ _not_ _sure_ _what_ _it would be_ . _it would be_ money better spent than 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: _do_ _you know_ [it] costs more [to] keep _an_ inmate _on_ death row than [it] does [to] send [a] kid [to] harvard ? that's true . 
B|45| M: no [i'm] [sure] [it's] [not] . 
A|46| B: statistically that's true . 
B|47| M: [yeah .] 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: [but i think] [it would be] [an] appropriate [punishment] . 
A|50| B: are [you] _for it_ ? 
B|51| M: [i] am [for [it] .] 
A|52| B: [i'm] [for it] [in] [in] _some_ cases . 
B|53| M: [i don't [know] .] 
A|54| B: [yeah .] 
B|55| M: [and [i] think] [it's] important [that] [we] decide [what] [we] want [to do .] 
A|56| B: [what] kind _of_ crimes [would] [you] use [it] [for] ?
