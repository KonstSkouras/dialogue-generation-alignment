B|1| M:  !!! ; !! remind me _of [that_ .] 
A|2| B: so _i_ get _it_ from t v a lot . _i_ get time _i_ _read_ time magazine um that's _one_ _i_ _read_ pretty regularly . 
B|3| M: _uh_ _well_ [that] [that] _is_ [one] _of_ my favorites _too_ . 
A|4| B: _and_ _uh ._ _the_ _thing_ _about_ _it_ _you know_ now [that] i've found [is] [that] we get such good coverage on t v or at least such _i_ _don't_ _know_ attempted thoroughness [of] coverage by _the_ time _you_ get _the_ time magazine there's nothing _in_ _it_ _you don't_ _know ._ 
B|5| M: yeah . 
A|6| B: _right ._ _then_ _you can_ _just_ sort [of] have pictures _to_ go along with _it_ or something because really i've thought lately there's nothing new _in_ _the_ time magazine . 
B|7| M: uh-hau yeah there there [is] _but_ _it's it's_ [just] [that] _uh you know ._ [it] [it] [it] [just] seems _like [you_ can] [uh] _see_ [the] same [thing] [in] [just] [about] [uh] 
A|8| B: [you know] [it's it's] basically you've heard everything 
B|9| M: yeah . 
A|10| B: _and_ [uh you] might [you] might get a little more thorough [uh] account [of] something [but] really um _i_ _don't_ [know .] so _i_ get most [of] mine from television 
B|11| M: yeah . 
A|12| B: _i_ would say . 
B|13| M: yeah [i watch] _for_ [the news] _and then_ i'll [watch] _for_ _for_ _for_ [the] commercials . 
A|14| B: _right_ 
B|15| M: _i i_ _like_ [to] [read] [the] washington post . 
A|16| B: _and [i_ i] think there's an attempt [to] do [that .] [you know] [i] think people there's a mild attempt [for] [that] [but] [i] think basically we basically associate [news] with bad [news] or or catastrophes or problems or crises or [uh you know .] 
B|17| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|18| B: [i] think our concept [of] [news] isn't necessarily events [that] happen . [it's] more negative [like you] said . 
B|19| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|20| B: [but] [i] think people try [to] on on t v [i] think they try [to] throw [in] good stuff [but] [it] doesn't [uh] [it] doesn't sway [the] vote . 
B|21| M: [right .] 
A|22| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| M: [and] [you don't] hear [the news] very often . 
A|24| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: [uh] [and i] guess [uh .] 
A|26| B: [right .] [you know] [the] war last winter was certainly a good example [of that] because we saw every single [thing] practically . 
B|27| M: [uh] yeah yeah . 
A|28| B: [i] mean [you know] [i] remember [well] [just] [the] things [that] are covered . [i] remember watching [the] world series during [the] earthquake [and] [just] seeing [that] happen 
B|29| M: yeah . 
A|30| B: [i] mean [you know] [that] was [just] so phenomenal [to] [see] this stadium shake [and] [the] [and] [the] announcers [you know] grabbing 
B|31| M: oh . 
A|32| B: [i] mean [it's] [like] [that] was [just] something because [that] was [like] live [and] real [like you] said 
B|33| M: yeah . 
A|34| B: [and then] [of] course [one] [thing] [i] think [too] [is] with
