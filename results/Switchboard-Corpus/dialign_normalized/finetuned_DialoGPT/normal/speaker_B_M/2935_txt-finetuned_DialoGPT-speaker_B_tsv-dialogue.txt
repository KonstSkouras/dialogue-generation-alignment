A|26| B: [oh [,] yeah [,] my] husband does [that ,] thank goodness , because [i ,] that's [not] [a] pleasure _for_ me 
B|27| M: [oh] . 
A|28| B: [i] love gardens [that] _are_ [well] tended _, and [i_ just ,] there's [been] [a] few different places _i've lived_ where _i've_ [just] [i don't know] whether [it's] little old ladies living there or [what] [, but] [you] could [just] tell [that] _they_ had [a] love [, uh [,] a] love affair [with] their gardens , [with] beautiful wild flowers [, and] [just , i] love [the] host [of] [colors] [that] [just] keep coming all [, you] [know ,] year long . [and , uh [,] i , i was] [in] england once [, and] that's one thing [that] impressed me [so] [much] [is] _no_ matter [what] size yard somebody had _, they_ had [a] beautiful [garden] [in] [it] . [you] [know [,] it] could [be] three feet by four feet or something . 
B|29| M: [yeah _,] [that_ _,] that_ [is] _, that_ _would be_ [a] big influence . 
A|30| B: [so] [i] [do] admire [that [,] but] [i] haven't [really] put [, uh [,] [too] much] energy into [it] . course [we have] two little kids [that] _are_ two [and] three _years_ old 
B|31| M: [uh ,] 
A|32| B: [so] [that] has put [a] crimp [in] [my] every activity [other] than diapers [and] laundry , i'll tell [you] 
B|33| M: [oh] [yeah [,] they] [do] . 
A|34| B: [yeah ,] that's [really] lovely [. i] [would] love [to] [have] different fruit trees . [it's [,] it's] [been wonderful] [to] [have] [the] peaches . they're [just] delicious . [and [,] we] [, we] [we have] , still [have to] spray some [, but] [we] [don't] [have to] [just] asphyxiate ourself [with] [the] poison , which [is] _good_ , because [i just , i] can't [see the] point [in] doing [that] [and] eating anything [out] [of] [it] afterwards . 
B|35| M: [yeah .] 
A|36| B: um , we've tried them [, but] again [, [it's] just] [like] [the] sun scorch . 
B|37| M: [oh ,] [no] . 
A|38| B: we've tried them [in] kind [of] halfway [in the] shade [and] halfway [in the] [i] mean [it's [just] [,] you] [really] , [really] [have [to] be] prepared [to] water constantly during [the] summer . 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: [people] [that] [have] [been] successful [out] here [have] done this drip irrigation [and] installed [that ,] 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [and] um , that's [really] [what] _makes_ [the] most _sense_ , because [you] [don't] [have to] use [so] [much] water [, and] 
B|43| M: [yeah _,] that_ [makes] [sense] . 
A|44| B: [it] [really] does [the] [job .] [but [it's] just] amazing how hot [and] dry [and] _for_ how long [it] gets [out] here . [and] if [you're] [not] [really] committed [to] [it [,] i] mean , me [, i'm] [, you] [know [,] i'm] real committed [to] [it] _for_ about [a] week [, and then] [i] forget about [it] _for_ [a] week [, and then] [i] [go] , [oh [,] yeah [,] i] need [to] [do] something [, and] by [then] [it's] burned up [, you] [know] . 
B|45| M: [yeah .] 
A|46| B: [it's just] [too] distracting [right] _now_ [with] these little ones [in] our lives , [so] maybe [when] [i] [get] older i'll [find] [, uh ,] some joy [in] [that] 
B|47| M: [uh _,] well _,_ i think_ [that [,] uh] . 
A|48| B: [yeah .] [yeah , [it] just] gets [so] hot [so] fast here . [we] [don't] [have] [really] [a] [spring] or [a] fall 
B|49| M:  !!! % !! _weather_ !! _weather_ !! _weather_ !! forecast !! wind !! 
A|50| B: [and] [it [just] [,] uh ,] immediately heats up . [so ,] that's one thing [i] miss about living up [north] , as [i] remember , um [, you] [know [,] the] long springs [and] long falls [and the] cooler [weather] . [it was] [really] [nice] . 
B|51| M: [uh _,] well [,_ i'm] originally [from] [the] [, uh] new york area [and [i] ,] [i've lived] _in , uh [,_ the] northern _part of_ [the] state [for] [, uh] twenty [years] . 
A|52| B: [we] always had gardens [when] [i [was] , uh ,] living [in] chicago . [in] fact [, my] mother once tore up our entire back yard [and] redid [it] . i'll never forget . [got] [my] stepfather [to] put [in , uh [,] a] waterfall [and] [a] little pond [in] one corner [. i] mean [, that] [was] [like] [the] most energy invested [in] anything [in the] whole [time] [i] ever knew him [they] remodeled [the] entire back yard . [then] [they] sold [the] house [and] [got] divorced , [so] [i don't know] [what] [that] says about [it] all 
B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: [oh [,] but] she used [to] love [to] [do] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|55| M: _well ,_ [now [,] is that] [the] _part_ [that] [you're] saying [that [,] [that] [,] uh] ... 
A|56| B: [yeah , it] [really] [was] [. i] enjoyed [it] there . [but] maybe [when] [the] boys [get] [a] little older , we'll [do] some [more] planting , because [they] [like to] [see] things grow . they've done [a] couple [of] little seed projects [, and] [so] [i think] [it] [would be] fun [for] them . 
B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: [yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
B|59| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [oh ,] _yes_ they're both running around [now] . 
B|61| M: [yes] [, they] [are] . 
A|62| B: [yeah [,] _well ,] it's_ very therapeutic [, i think ,] [really] [to get] [out] there [and] dig [in the] dirt [, you] [know] . 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [they] certainly enjoy [that] [part of] [it] [it's just] trying [to] keep anything [. i] planted bulbs last [, uh ,] fall [on the] side guard [, and] [when] [i] [went] [out] there [in the] [spring] [and the] first day [they] came [out] [the] little one [went] [and] pulled all [the] flowers off [, [and] the] flower petals were scattered all over [the] walk 
B|65| M: [oh] . 
A|66| B: he thought , [what] [are] these fun toys [that] mommy put [out] here [with] all these [colors] [for] me [to] play [with] ? at least he didn't eat them [, i] mean [, i] guess [i] could [be] thankful [for] [that] . 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [yeah ,] [really] . if [they] survive this year . [oh [,] well ,] _good_ luck _to you_ . 
B|69| M: [well , it's] [good] _talking to you_ [, and i] hope [you [have] a] [good] evening . 
A|70| B: [nice] [talking to you] .
