[and uh] [i i was] [in] england once [and] that's one thing [that] impressed me [so] [much] [is] _no_ matter [what] size yard somebody had _they_ had [a] beautiful [garden] [in] [it] . [you] [know] [it] could [be] three feet by four feet or something . 
B|29| M: [yeah] [that] [that] [is that] _would be_ [a] big influence . 
A|30| B: [so i] [do] admire [that] [but] [i] haven't [really] put [uh] [too much] energy into [it] . course [we have] two little kids [that] _are_ two [and] three _years_ old 
B|31| M: [uh] 
A|32| B: [so] [that] has put [a] crimp [in] [my] every activity [other] than diapers [and] laundry i'll tell [you] 
B|33| M: [oh yeah] [they] [do] . 
A|34| B: [yeah] that's [really] lovely [. i] [would] love [to] [have] different fruit trees . [it's] [it's] [been wonderful] [to] [have] [the] peaches . they're [just] delicious . [and] [we] [we] [we have] still [have to] spray some [but] [we] [don't] [have to] [just] asphyxiate ourself [with] [the] poison which [is] _good_ because [i just i] can't [see the] point [in] doing [that] [and] eating anything [out] [of] [it] afterwards . 
B|35| M: [yeah .] 
A|36| B: um we've tried them [but] again [it's just] [like] [the] sun scorch . 
B|37| M: [oh] [no] . 
A|38| B: we've tried them [in] kind [of] halfway [in the] shade [and] halfway [in the] [i] mean [it's just] [you] [really] [really] [have [to] be] prepared [to] water constantly during [the] summer . 
B|39| M: [yeah .] 
A|40| B: [people] [that] [have] [been] successful [out] here [have] done this drip irrigation [and] installed [that] 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [and] um that's [really] [what] _makes_ [the] most _sense_ because [you] [don't] [have to] use [so] [much] water [and] 
B|43| M: [yeah] [that] [makes] [sense] . 
A|44| B: [it] [really] does [the] [job .] [but [it's] just] amazing how hot [and] dry [and] _for_ how long [it] gets [out] here . [and] if [you're] [not] [really] committed [to] [it] [i] mean me [i'm] [you] [know] [i'm] real committed [to] [it] _for_ about [a] week [and then] [i] forget about [it] _for_ [a] week [and then] [i] [go] [oh yeah] [i] need [to] [do] something [and] by [then] [it's] burned up [you] [know] . 
B|45| M: [yeah .] 
A|46| B: [it's just] [too] distracting [right] _now_ [with] these little ones [in] our lives [so] maybe [when] [i] [get] older i'll [find] [uh] some joy [in] [that] 
B|47| M: [uh] [well] _i think_ [that] [uh] . 
A|48| B: [yeah .] [yeah [it] just] gets [so] hot [so] fast here . [we] [don't] [have] [really] [a] [spring] or [a] fall 
B|49| M:  !!! % !! _weather_ !! _weather_ !! _weather_ !! forecast !! wind !! 
A|50| B: [and] [it just] [uh] immediately heats up . [so] that's one thing [i] miss about living up [north] as [i] remember um [you] [know] [the] long springs [and] long falls [and the] cooler [weather] . [it was] [really] [nice] . 
B|51| M: [uh] [well] [i'm] originally [from] [the] [uh] new york area [and i] [i've lived] _in uh_ [the] northern _part of_ [the] state [for] [uh] twenty [years] . 
A|52| B: [we] always had gardens [when] [i [was] uh] living [in] chicago . [in] fact [my] mother once tore up our entire back yard [and] redid [it] . i'll never forget . [got] [my] stepfather [to] put [in uh] [a] waterfall [and] [a] little pond [in] one corner [. i] mean [that] [was] [like] [the] most energy invested [in] anything [in the] whole [time] [i] ever knew him [they] remodeled [the] entire back yard . [then] [they] sold [the] house [and] [got] divorced [so i don't know] [what] [that] says about [it] all 
B|53| M: [yeah .] 
A|54| B: [oh] [but] she used [to] love [to] [do] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|55| M: [well] [now] [is that] [the] _part_ [that] [you're] saying [that] [that] [uh] ... 
A|56| B: [yeah it] [really] [was] [. i] enjoyed [it] there . [but] maybe [when] [the] boys [get] [a] little older we'll [do] some [more] planting because [they] [like to] [see] things grow . they've done [a] couple [of] little seed projects [and] [so [i] think] [it] [would be] fun [for] them . 
B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [oh] _yes_ they're both running around [now] . 
B|61| M: [yes] [they] [are] . 
A|62| B: [yeah] _well it's_ very therapeutic [i think] [really] [to get] [out] there [and] dig [in the] dirt [you] [know] . 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [they] certainly enjoy [that] [part of] [it] [it's just] trying [to] keep anything [. i] planted bulbs last [uh] fall [on the] side guard [and] [when] [i] [went] [out] there [in the] [spring [and] the] first day [they] came [out] [the] little one [went] [and] pulled all [the] flowers off [and the] flower petals were scattered all over [the] walk 
B|65| M: [oh] . 
A|66| B: he thought [what] [are] these fun toys [that] mommy put [out] here [with] all these [colors] [for] me [to] play [with] ? at least he didn't eat them [i] mean [i] guess [i] could [be] thankful [for] [that] . 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| B: [yeah] [really] . if [they] survive this year . [oh] [well] _good_ luck _to you_ . 
B|69| M: [well it's] [good] _talking to you_ [and i] hope [you [have] a] [good] evening . 
A|70| B: [nice] [talking to you] . 
B|71| M: bye .
