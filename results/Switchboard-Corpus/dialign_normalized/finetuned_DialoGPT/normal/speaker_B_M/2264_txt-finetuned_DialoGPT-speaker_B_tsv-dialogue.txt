A|0| B: huh-uh . 
B|1| M: _and_ you're _not_ supposed _to_ _put_ your _stuff_ _in_ _the_ garbage _and _they_ pick_ _it_ _up_ _at the_ curb but you're supposed _to_ . 
A|2| B: they'll help _you_ recycle because _we_ there is some bins _like_ _behind_ wal-mart _that_ _take_ some _things ._ 
B|3| M: _oh_ really ? 
A|4| B: _yeah ._ 
B|5| M: _oh_ _i_ see . 
A|6| B: because [i] finally asked because _you_ know _we_ had all of _those_ milk cartons [and] there _was_ nowhere else [to] _take them_ [and they] had [it] [in] front of wal-mart _and i_ ask [in] wal-mart [and they] said _they moved_ [it] _just_ _behind_ . 
B|7| M: [yeah] [they moved] _the_ ones [that] _were_ _behind the_ counter _to the_ other ones _too ._ 
A|8| B: huh-uh . 
B|9| M: but _uh_ [you] _just don't have the_ time _to do_ _it ._ 
A|10| B: _yeah ._ 
B|11| M: _so_ [we] went [and] took _it to the_ _uh_ _the city_ [and they] took [it] _up_ _to the city_ _. and_ _uh_ . 
A|12| B: _yeah ._ 
B|13| M: _um_ [and i] can't even remember _what_ [they] call [those] [things .] 
A|14| B: _like_ aluminum cans ? 
B|15| M: [yeah] [i] [i] [like] _to use_ [those] . 
A|16| B: _that's_ about [what] [we] [do] [too .] 
B|17| M: [yeah] [i] i've done [that] [too .] i've made [like] _uh_ _two_ _or_ three different ones _. i_ [just] _use_ plastic . 
A|18| B: well [i] guess [um] down [in] kind of [in] north dallas there is _a_ place [that] will _take_ almost anything . 
B|19| M: uh-huh . 
A|20| B: [uh] [i] [don't] [we] [just don't have the] _room_ [to] store all [that] much [you] know 
B|21| M: [yeah .] 
A|22| B: [i] [don't] want [to] be running down there every week [or] whatever . 
B|23| M: right . 
A|24| B: [yeah .] 
B|25| M: [and] [and] [uh] _i'm_ sure [that] [the] more [we] learn _to do_ _with_ [it] [the] more [it] seems [to] work _out_ . 
A|26| B: [yeah .] 
B|27| M: [and] then [i] [just] throw [them] away [you] can't [take them] . 
A|28| B: [those] milk cartons [take] [up] [so] much _room_ . 
B|29| M: right . 
A|30| B: [i] guess [we] kind of started recycling after [i] [moved] here about _a_ year _and a half_ ago . 
B|31| M: uh-huh . 
A|32| B: [we] [were] using baby food [and] there _was_ [so] many baby food jars kind of [what] started [it .] 
B|33| M: [yeah .] 
A|34| B: some of our neighbors [were] doing [it] [and] [so] [you] know when [i] found [out] some places [to] [take] [it] [and] [um] [like] [um] [they] also [take] some [things] [at the] flower mound dump [behind the] fire station there [and i] know [that] they're going [to use] [you] know [the] money for [that] [to] build some kind of multipurpose field [and] [that] type of thing . [put] lights [and] [stuff] 
B|35| M: uh-huh . 
A|36| B: [so] [you] know if [i'm] [not] going [to] get [the] money for aluminum [i] _would_ [just] assume give [it [to the] city] of flower mound . [to do] something [with] [you] know . 
B|37| M: uh-huh . 
A|38| B: [yeah .] _that's_ true [. [and] they] won't raise our taxes . 
B|39| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! remind _me_ . 
A|40| B: [yeah .] 
B|41| M: but 
A|42| B: no [i] [don't] [. i] _have a_ friend of mine told [me] about this program is [the] reason [that] [i'm] 
B|43| M: _oh_ [that's] [a] neat idea . 
A|44| B: [yeah .] 
B|45| M: [and] then [they] [would] [put] [you] [in] [a] different one [. and] then they'd [have a] [a] special [room] _where_ [you] could drop [them] off [and] then [you] could go back [and] forth [. and] _it was_ _it was_ really neat . 
A|46| B: is _talking to_ someone [in] sorry . 
B|47| M: [yeah] it's _okay_ _it was nice_ [talking _to] you ._ 
A|48| B: she'll be [two] [in] july .
