B|23| M: right . 
A|24| B: [yeah .] 
B|25| M: _and _,_ and ,_ [uh ,] _i'm_ sure [that] [the] more [we] learn _to do_ _with_ _it _,_ the_ more [it] seems [to] work _out_ . 
A|26| B: [yeah .] 
B|27| M: [and] then [i] [just] throw [them] away [, you] can't [take them] .

[put] lights [and] [stuff] 
B|35| M: uh-huh . 
A|36| B: [so] [, you] know , if [i'm] [not] going [to] get [the] money for aluminum [, i] _would_ [just] assume give [it [to the] city] of flower mound . [to do] something [with] [, you] know . 
B|37| M: uh-huh . 
A|38| B: [yeah .] _that's_ true [. [and] they] won't raise our taxes .

A|44| B: [yeah .] 
B|45| M: [and] then [they] [would] [put] [you] [in] [a] different one [. and] then they'd [have a] , [a] special [room] _where_ [you] could drop [them] off [and] then [you] could go back [and] forth [. and] _it was_ _, it was_ really neat .
