A|58| B: eye [care] _is good_ . _i do_ _not_ [i] am _not_ _i do_ _not_ _think we_ [have] [that] _on_ our policy .

A|60| B: _but uh_ [we] 
B|61| M: [i [think] we] need [to] [uh] . 
A|62| B: [yeah .] [it would be] great [i mean] _uh the_ _glasses_ [that] [the] exams themselves _are not_ _expensive_ [it's] [the] _glasses ._ 
B|63| M: _yes_ [and] [they] [are not] [they] _are expensive_ [because] [of the] different types [of] [glasses .] [uh the] one [that] [is good] [for] [for] [women] [is] [the] plano [uh] [glasses] [company] . 
A|64| B: [yeah] [that's] [true .] 
B|65| M: [but] _um_ [you know] [that] [that] [is] one [of the] things [that [i] think] [is] [really] [important] [and] [i think] [it's] [really] [really] hard _on the_ elderly . 
A|66| B: [right] _now_ [like] _my_ ... [right .] [well] [like] _my_ mother she has [to go] [for] testing cause she has got 
B|67| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that] [now] . 
A|68| B: [well] she does _not have_ _it but_ she [is] [like] [on the] verge [of] [it] _or_ something . 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|70| B: her eyes [are] changing 
B|71| M: [yeah .] 
A|72| B: [and] she has [to] [be] tested periodically [. [and] and] those [are expensive] tests . 
B|73| M: _yes_ [i i think that] [uh] 
A|74| B: [now] [i think] [your] insurance covers her [on] [that] 
B|75| M: [uh] _yes_ [i do .] 
A|76| B: [but] [you know] [for] something [like] [that] [that's] [just] as bad as [a] _medical_ [you know] [that's] 
B|77| M: _oh_ [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|78| B: [right .] 
B|79| M: [and] [uh] 
A|80| B: [right .] 
B|81| M: so [uh] . 
A|82| B: [now] [i would like to see] better _dental_ insurance [to] [me .] _was_ [that] our beep ? 
B|83| M: _oh_ [i think] so [i] [was] [just] listening [to] [a] program [on the] radio [and] [they were] talking [about] [uh] [medical] coverage 
A|84| B: [oh] . huh . 
B|85| M: so [i [have] to] say [i [would] [not] have] chosen _the dental_ plan over [the] health plan . 
A|86| B: [okay .] 
B|87| M: [and] [uh [i] have] [two] kids [and] so [i] don't [have [a] lot of] [time] [to] watch t v so . 
A|88| B: [but] [with] [the] three children [um] orthopedic [care] [um] [not] orthopedic orthodontic [care] 
B|89| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|90| B: [because] [on] [on] [a lot [of] [the] dental] insurance [they] [do] [not] cover [that] [well] . [for] [the] [the] orthodontia stuff . 
B|91| M: [uh] uh-hauhuh [uh] 
A|92| B: [yes] [it] [is] . 
B|93| M: [uh] [but uh] [but] [they] they're [they] [have] [they] [work] [with] [uh] [you know] other [companies] _that do _that_ [do_ .] 
A|94| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|95| M: [and] [then] [uh] . 
A|96| B: [yeah .] 
B|97| M: [and] [uh] 
A|98| B: [right .] _my_ middle _child_ needs [to have] [uh] orthodontic he's [because] his his pallet [is] squared [not] rounded . 
B|99| M: uh-oh . 
A|100| B: [and] [it] affects his speech [a] little bit [not] [not] anything [you know] 
B|101| M: [right] [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [right .] 
B|103| M: so i'm [i] guess [i] don't [know] how [i] feel [about] [it but] [i] don [i [i think] [i] would] [probably be] _more_ comfortable [with] [a] [a] person taking [care] [of] [my] [child] . 
A|104| B: [but] [just] enough [that] his bite [is] off [a] little bit [and] [it's] [like] four hundred dollars [and] [my] insurance [is] only _going to_ cover [like] fifty [of] _it ._ 
B|105| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|106| B: [oh] . 
B|107| M: so i'm [going [to] [have] to] [do] some consulting [work] [on] [it .] i'm [not] sure [if] [i] trust [them] [or] [not] [but] [i do] [i do] trust [them] . 
A|108| B: [really] . 
B|109| M: so [uh i] 
A|110| B: [that] sounds [like] [it would] hurt [more] . 
B|111| M: [i would] [think it would] . 
A|112| B: [oh] gosh . [i i would] much rather [that do that] [to] myself than make [my] five year old [go] in [and] [do] [it [.] [that] would] kill [me .]
