B|61| M: [i [think] we] need [to] [, uh] . 
A|62| B: [yeah .] [it would be] great [, i mean _,] _uh ,_ the_ _glasses_ _that _,_ the_ exams themselves _are not_ _expensive_ , [it's] [the] _glasses ._ 
B|63| M: _yes [,_ and] [they] [are [not] _,] they_ _are expensive_ [because] [of the] different types [of] [glasses .] [uh , the] one [that] [is good] [for [,] for] [women] [is] [the] plano [, uh] [glasses] [company] . 
A|64| B: [yeah ,] [that's] [true .] 
B|65| M: [but _,] um [,_ you know ,] [that ,] [that] [is] one [of the] things [that [i] think] [is] [really] [important] [, and] [i think] [it's] [really] , [really] hard _on the_ elderly . 
A|66| B: [right ,] _now_ [like] _my_ ... [right .] [well ,] [like] _my_ mother , she has [to go] [for] testing cause she has got , 
B|67| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that] [now] . 
A|68| B: [well ,] she does _not have_ _it _, but_ ,_ she [is] [like] , [on the] verge [of] [it] _or_ , something . 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|70| B: her eyes [are] changing , 
B|71| M: [yeah .] 
A|72| B: [and] she has [to] [be] tested periodically [. [and] , and] those [are expensive] tests . 
B|73| M: _yes [,_ [i] , i think [that] [,] uh ,] 
A|74| B: [now] [, i think] [your] insurance covers her [on] [that ,] 
B|75| M: [uh ,] _yes [,_ [i] do .] 
A|76| B: [but] [you know [,] for] something [like] [that ,] [that's] [just] as bad as [a] _medical_ [, you know ,] [that's] , 
B|77| M: _oh ,_ [yeah ,] [yeah .] 
A|78| B: [right .] 
B|79| M: [and [,] uh ,] 
A|80| B: [right .] 
B|81| M: so [, uh] . 
A|82| B: [now] [, i would like to see] better _dental_ insurance [to] [me .] _was_ [that] our beep ? 
B|83| M: _oh [,_ i think] so [, i] [was] [just] listening [to] [a] program [on the] radio [, and] [they were] talking [about] [, uh] [medical] coverage , 
A|84| B: [oh] . huh . 
B|85| M: so [i [have] to] say [i [would] [not] have] chosen _the dental_ plan over [the] health plan . 
A|86| B: [okay .] 
B|87| M: [and [,] [uh [,] i] have] [two] kids [and] so [, i] don't [have [a] lot of] [time] [to] watch t v , so . 
A|88| B: [but ,] [with] [the] three children [um ,] orthopedic [care] [, um ,] [not] orthopedic , orthodontic [care] , 
B|89| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|90| B: [because] [on] , [on] [a lot [of] [the] dental] insurance [, they] [do] [not] cover [that] [well] . [for] [the] [, the] orthodontia stuff . 
B|91| M: [uh ,] uh-hauhuh [, uh ,] 
A|92| B: [yes [,] it] [is] . 
B|93| M: [uh [,] [but ,] uh [,] but] [they] , they're [, they] _have [,_ they] [work] [with] [, uh] [you know ,] other [companies] [that] [do] , [that] [do .] 
A|94| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|95| M: [and] [then] [, uh] . 
A|96| B: [yeah .] 
B|97| M: [and [,] uh] 
A|98| B: [right .] _my_ middle _child_ needs [to [have] [,] uh ,] orthodontic , he's [because] his , his pallet [is] squared , [not] rounded . 
B|99| M: uh-oh . 
A|100| B: [and] [it] affects his speech [a] little bit , [not ,] [not] anything [, you know ,] 
B|101| M: [right ,] [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [right .] 
B|103| M: so , i'm [, i] guess [, i] don't [know] how [i] feel [about] [it , but] [i] don [, [i] , [i think] [i] would] [probably be] _more_ comfortable [with] [a] [, a] person taking [care] [of] [my] [child] . 
A|104| B: [but] [just] enough [that] his bite [is] off [a] little bit [and] [it's] [like] four hundred dollars [, and] [my] insurance [is] only _going to_ cover [like] fifty [of] _it ._ 
B|105| M: _oh ,_ [really] ? 
A|106| B: [oh] . 
B|107| M: so i'm [going [to] [have] to] [do] some consulting [work] [on] [it .] i'm [not] sure [if] [i] trust [them] [or] [not [,] but] [i do] [, [i] do] trust [them] . 
A|108| B: [really] . 
B|109| M: so [, [uh ,] [i] ,] 
A|110| B: [that] sounds [like] [it would] hurt [more] . 
B|111| M: [i would] [think it would] . 
A|112| B: [oh ,] gosh . [i , i would] much rather [that ,] [do] [that [,] to] myself than make [my] five year old [go] in [and] [do] [it [.] [that] would] kill [me .]
