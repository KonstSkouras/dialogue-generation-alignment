A|0| B: _the_ area _i work_ _in_ _it_ _it_ primarily _have_ maybe _a_ hundred _people_ or _so_ . 
B|1| M: yeah . 
A|2| B: _so_ _that's_ make up most of _the_ laboratory _so_ from from _that_ standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small . 
B|3| M: yeah i've _i was_ thinking _about_ [that] too _and i_ _i think_ [that's] [a] [that's] _probably_ _true_ _. i_ _uh i_ [have] _some_ friends [that] [work] _for_ [a] university uh-havings _uh_ . 
A|4| B: _what_ [about] yourself ? 
B|5| M: _well_ i'm [a] [i work] _for_ [a] university . 
A|6| B: oh okay . 
B|7| M: _and_ [so] _uh_ . 
A|8| B: oh okay [. i] see . 
B|9| M: _and uh_ . 
A|10| B: oh okay . _right ._ [uh] 
B|11| M: _but_ [uh] . 
A|12| B: uh-huh . _right ._ 
B|13| M: _and uh_ . 
A|14| B: [well] those [and] [probably] _the_ _security_ aspect of _it_ . 
B|15| M: [right .] 
A|16| B: because [a] lot of time nowadays even though _you're_ working _uh you're_ treated [and] _it_ may not _be_ [true] _in_ every place . _in a_ lot of cases [i think] _you're_ treated more like [a] number instead of [a] [a] person . 
B|17| M: yeah . 
A|18| B: because when _it_ come down _to_ layoff _they_ _don't_ _really_ consider _people_ [and] _and _you_ know_ their [well] being as far as _you know_ how _they_ going their next dollar going _to_ come _in_ . how _they_ going _to_ pay their bills . _they_ just lay them off . 
B|19| M: yeah . 
A|20| B: [and [i] was] reading this book one time [about] this guy [that] had [uh [i] think] _the_ company still exists _. what_ _they_ use _to_ _do_ is _they_ used _to_ cut _the_ number of hours [for] everybody as opposed _to_ just laying _people_ off _you _know_ ._ 
B|21| M: huh . 
A|22| B: [that] way _that _you_ know_ one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time . 
B|23| M: [right .] 
A|24| B: [and uh] _you know [i_ think] if _they_ had programs [that] set up _to_ subsidize _people_ [that] _do_ get laid off [a] little bit _better_ _you know_ other _than_ _you know_ something like unemployment is good [but] _i mean_ _the_ company as [a] whole because _you_ as an employee even _the_ company is making money _they_ paying _you_ [a] salary [but] _you_ are responsible [for] [that] company growth . _you're_ responsible also [for] helping [that] company get _to_ _the_ point [that] it's at at making profits . [so] there should _be_ something _in_ there or [some] kind of clause [that] will subsidize _people_ if _they_ did lose their _job_ other _than_ _you know_ [uh] neglect or something like _that ._ 
B|25| M: [right .] 
A|26| B: _you _know_ ._ because it's not [a] person's fault _that _you_ know_ _people_ not buying or businesses are are not on _the_ up [and] up all _the_ time _you _know_ [._ _i] don't_ see how one or two _people_ maybe more one or two [but] _you know_ [a] number of _people_ can can _be_ _the_ downfall of [a] company situation . 
B|27| M: yeah . 
A|28| B: [well] _in a_ sense [that] say how _do you_ make [a] [a] conclusion [that] _you're_ going _to_ lay off these _ten people_ . [uh] [for] _the_ bad times of _the_ company . 
B|29| M: [well] yeah [that's] [true] . 
A|30| B: _what_ [about] _the_ _the_ [work] effort those _ten people_ did when _the_ company [was] doing [well] . 
B|31| M: [well] [you] can't [really] [. [i] mean] [they] [they] put [ten people] [in a] [in a] room where [they] _have a_ kitchen 
A|32| B: _you _know_ ._ [in] [that] standpoint . 
B|33| M: [right .] 
A|34| B: yes [i] _do_ . 
B|35| M: [i] [i] [i think] _it would_ _be better_ [than] [that .] 
A|36| B: [i] [really] _do_ [. [i] think] it'd [be better] [that] way [and] even at [that] [it would] at least give _the_ person time _to_ look [for] another _job_ because [they] _know_ _that that_ there are _problems_ 
B|37| M: [uh] [well] [you know i] [i think] [that] [uh you're] [right] [that [that] you] [the] [you] [have] [to] [have] [the] [job] [security] [and you] [have] [the] [uh] [the] training [and] [the] background [to] deal with [problems] 
A|38| B: [and [you] know] there are reason [to] look [for] another [job] instead of just dumping [it] on them all at one time . 
B|39| M: yeah . yeah . 
A|40| B: [you _know] ._ [that's] just [that's] my views [you _know] ._ 
B|41| M: [well] [i don't] [know [.] what] [do you] [think] ? 
A|42| B: [right .] [right .] [right .] 
B|43| M: [and uh] . 
A|44| B: [well] at least [that] [would] give [a] person [a] chance [to] look [you [know] .] because [the] way [it] is [a] person [really] [don't] [have a] chance 
B|45| M: yeah [well] yeah .
