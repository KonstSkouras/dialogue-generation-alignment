A|0| B: _yeah _._ yeah _,_ i've_ had _a_ variety of different jobs with _a_ various types _, uh ,_ in _the_ computer field . _and_ _so_ _i've_ seen _a_ variety of types of benefits . _uh , i've_ _worked_ for , for for awhile _and_ they are _, _you_ know_ , _a_ _really_ academic type of place . _and_ then _i've_ _worked_ with regular _, _you_ know_ , industry type places . _and_ then with others _that_ are kind of half way between _and_ stuff . _so_ _i've_ seen _a_ wide range of both _, _you_ know_ , nonsalary type benefits _and_ other stuff _, _you_ know_ , _like_ health care _that's_ either fully or partially paid _and_ _, _you_ know_ , some _have_ _like_ bonuses _and_ others _have_ had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits _and_ _so_ _, yeah , i_ would 
B|1| M: right . 
A|2| B: i'd say health care is way up _there_ , especially anybody with kids . _uh_ _and_ _that's_ one of _the_ big things _that_ we _always_ look _at_ _, _you_ know ._ _when_ we , _when_ _i _think_ about_ changing jobs is _, _you_ know_ _, _you_ know_ , what kind of health care they _have_ 
B|3| M: _uh _, i_ think_ [that's] _probably_ [the] most _important_ _thing_ . 
A|4| B: _and_ does [the] company pay for _it_ . _you know_ , all or partially or how does _that_ _work ._ 
B|5| M: [yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|6| B: _and_ _, uh ,_ also _, uh ,_ vacation time too is _a_ , is _a_ big one for me . [uh ,] _and _i_ guess_ support for whatever , whatever other _, _you_ know_ , kinds of professional activities _you have_ _at_ _, _you_ know_ , _work ._ 
B|7| M: right . 
A|8| B: [uh ,] cause _i've_ _been_ _at_ places which offer _a_ lot of support _and_ others _that_ _don't_ offer any _and_ some _that ,_ sometimes [that's] coincided with _a_ place _that_ offers _more_ vacation time though , 
B|9| M: [yeah ,] [that's] true . 
A|10| B: _so_ [that's] not _so_ bad _, _you_ know ._ 
B|11| M: [that's] true . [that's] true _, i guess_ i'm _just_ used _to_ [it] now [, _you] ,_ _you're_ used _to_ [when] _you go to_ [a] restaurant [, you] [don't] [really] [think about] what's _out_ [there] 
A|12| B: _you know_ , it's kind of [a] give _and_ take kind of [thing] [, i think] . 
B|13| M: right . 
A|14| B: [uh , i] say _that_ health care is [probably] definitely number one though . want [to] [just] [, _you] know_ , all your salary can't even begin [to] pay for what [you] can wind up losing [, _you] know_ in [a] major illness or _something_ . _uh ._ 
B|15| M: right . 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [you know .] 
A|18| B: uh-huh . 
B|19| M: [so] . 
A|20| B: [yeah .] _flexible_ hours are , are pretty [important] [to] me as _well_ . 
B|21| M: _well [, yeah [,_ i] think] [so] _. _i_ _,_ i , [uh ,_ i've] [always] [been] [a] [flexible] person _and i think_ [that's] [probably] why [i] _was_ [so] _good_ [at] _school_ _was_ because [i] [worked] [more] than [i] _did_ because [i] _did_ [have] _to [work_ .] 
A|22| B: [uh ,] cause _that_ makes [a] big difference . my wife works part-time . 
B|23| M: oh _, really_ ? 
A|24| B: [and] she works [, uh ,] as [a] assistant manager in [a] fabric store . 
B|25| M: oh , uh-hauhuh [, [uh] .] 
A|26| B: [and] [so] she works [a] lot of evenings [and] weekends [and] [so] two days [a] week [, i , uh ,] manage [to] get home early enough [to] meet [the] kids on [the] bus [so] she [you know] , goes in early those days [and] works _like_ [, [you] know] , noon til close . [uh ,] [so] we [have] 
B|27| M: [yeah .] 
A|28| B: [yeah ,] [and] being on [a] [, [you] know] , rigid schedule wouldn't , [there] wouldn't be anyway _to do_ _that_ [at] all . 
B|29| M: no [, i think] [, [uh] .] 
A|30| B: [and i think] it's kind of neat [to] be able [to] spend [the] afternoons with [the] kids occasionally too . 
B|31| M: [that's] true . 
A|32| B: [i] mean usually [, [you] know] [, [you] go [to] work] before they're awake or as they're getting , up for [school] [and] [you] get home [and] it's already dark unless it's summer time [, [you] know .] [and] even in summer time , sometimes [you] get home [so] late _that_ there's [, [you] know] [, you] can't _do_ anything with them . 
B|33| M: [yeah .] 
A|34| B: [and] especially in [the] winter [. i] mean [, you] get up in [the] dark [and] come home in [the] dark [you know .] it's _like_ , it's _like_ [a] vampire sometimes 
B|35| M: [yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|36| B: [yeah .] 
B|37| M: he's _a great_ man [and i think] [that [,] _you] [,_ [you] have] [to] [have] [the] leadership [to do] _something like that ._ 
A|38| B: [uh ,] [a] lot of [i guess] is . 
B|39| M: what's [that] ? 
A|40| B: [yeah [.] [i] think] some of , is how [the] [, uh [,] [you] know] [, i guess] it's not [really] [a] direct benefit but how your [, uh ,] performance is rated [and] stuff [like that] [at] [work .] 
B|41| M: right . 
A|42| B: cause [i've] [been] [, uh ,] especially in large corporations . [you] can [really] [, [you] know] , wind up getting , having [, [you] know] , real problems [i've] found [out] . [i've] [worked] for [a] few [, [you] know] , several thousand plus [, [you] know] , type companies . [and] [it] , [and] especially if [you're] doing [like] professional [work .] where [you know] , it's kind of ethereal as [to] what [you're] doing [you know .] 
B|43| M: right . 
A|44| B: if [you're] , [like] [i've] [, i] [work] with [, uh ,] computer systems [a] lot . [so] it's kind of hard [to] say [, [you] know .] if [you're] [, [you] know] , [a] brick layer , somebody can look [and] see [, [you] know] , [well , yeah [,] you] laid [, [you] know] , fifteen thousand bricks today [and] they were all straight [and] your building didn't fall down [, [you] know] [yeah [,] you] [did] [a great] job . but if [you] build computer systems , [like] , [well [,] [you] know] , what does [that] computer program [really] [do] [, [you] know .] or , especially if [you] write [like] papers [, [you] know .] or [do] design studies or [something] . 
B|45| M: right . right [. yeah ,] [that's] true . 
A|46| B: it's real hard [to] rate [something like that .] 
B|47| M: oh [, [yeah] .] 
A|48| B: it's [like] get [a] painter [, [you] know] , or [something] , [a] artist . it's [like] [well] [you ,] how [do] [you] [really] rate [, [you] know] , michelangelo [, [you] know] how would [you] tell if he [was] [, [you] know] [, really] [good] or so-so or whatever
