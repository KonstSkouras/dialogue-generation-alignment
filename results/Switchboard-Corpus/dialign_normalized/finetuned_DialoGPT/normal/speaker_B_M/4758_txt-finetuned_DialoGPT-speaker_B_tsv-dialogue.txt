B|7| M: [uh] [well _i] i_ _read_ [that] . 
A|8| B: _my_ wife also gets _a lot of_ _the_ food magazines . bon appetite [and] food [and] wine [and] gourmet . 
B|9| M: [oh] _yeah ._ 
A|10| B: [yeah .] [and] she still likes _to_ get time which i've never liked very much

A|12| B: _but_ she seems _to_ . 
B|13| M:  !!! % !! remind me . 
A|14| B: _do_ _you_ _read a_ newspaper ? 
B|15| M: [yeah] [i] _do _._ i_ [read [a] lot of] newspapers . 
A|16| B: [yeah .] larger computer ones . 
B|17| M: [but] 
A|18| B: _i haven't_ bought _it_ now [for about] eight [years .] [but] when [i] used _to_ get _it_ _it_ _was_ [about] five hundred pages [about] three hundred [of] them advertising . 
B|19| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: _that that_ half _the_ fun _is_ finding out what _all the_ products are . 
B|21| M: [yeah .] 
A|22| B: [but] _you know_ some [of] _the_ get ridiculous . travel [and] leisure _all_ [of] _the_ american express magazines 
B|23| M: [oh] [i] didn't [know] [that] . 
A|24| B: so travel [and] leisure food [and] wine [and i] think they _have_ some others [uh] certainly half _the_ pages [and] maybe more are pure ads plus they _have_ _the_ advertising supplement sections [that] are supposed _to_ look _like_ articles [but] are paid [for] [and] they don't care if they make any money on _the_ magazine subscription they're making everything on ads . 
B|25| M: [yeah .] 
A|26| B: [uh-huh .] _have_ _you_ ever [uh] [read] or subscribe _to_ consumer reports [for] any length [of] time ? 
B|27| M: _no_ [i haven't] . 
A|28| B: [but] _not_ worth _it_ . 
B|29| M: [well] [that that] [was] [a] [that] really [was] [a] good movie . 
A|30| B: [i] i've always had this _one_ [of] _the_ reasons [i] _like_ _just_ _to_ pick up magazines _in_ other fields _is_ _that you_ seem _to_ get [a] very different perspective . 
B|31| M:  !!! % !! translated _it's_ interesting isn't [it] ? 
A|32| B: so i've always had this problem with consumer reports [that] _in_ _the_ areas [that] [i] [know] [a lot] [about] [i] disagree with them . 
B|33| M: [oh] [i] see . 
A|34| B: [and i] always wonder whether _there_ are _people_ who [know] [a lot] [about] every area disagreeing with them on everything or or what's _going_ on 
B|35| M: [uh] [well] _you know there's_ [a lot of] things [like] [that you] [just] can't put [all the] [all] theuries [in] [one] place you're [not] [going] [to] put [all] these [people] [in] [one] spot [you] can't [do] [that] . 
A|36| B: so [i] [like] i've picked up now [a] subscription [to] [one] [of] [the] travel agent [uh] organization magazines [and] [it's] [a] ridiculous difference when [you] start reading from their perspective . [uh] [you know] their major interest _is_ [in] commissions [and] [you know there's] very little talk [about] [the] quality [of] places or airlines . their major talk _is_ [about] [you know] commissions [and] commission rebates [and] how they won't suggest hotels [to] [people] if [the] commission's [not] [a] [the] full ten percent or whatever [it] _is_ [and] [it] gives [you] [a] different perspective on what [people] [do .] 
B|37| M: right . 
A|38| B: [uh] some [of] them . [the] [the] general travel magazines [do .] 
B|39| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|40| B: [but] [i i] usually [just] [read] through [the] sections on on domestic stuff . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [no] . 
B|43| M: um [i] guess [my] favorite [is] [the new] york times . 
A|44| B: [yeah [.] i] don't take much more [in] myself . 
B|45| M: [yeah] [well i] guess that's [about] [all] then . 
A|46| B: okay . 
B|47| M: we [uh] [have a] couple [of] friends [that] live down [there] . 
A|48| B: okay nice talking [to] [you] .
