A|0| B: _you_ bet . 
B|1| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! 
A|2| B: i'll let _you_ lead out . 
B|3| M: all _right_ . 
A|4| B: i'll let _you_ lead out . 
B|5| M: _well_ _it's_ _not_ mine _. i_ _just_ got _it_ from _a_ friend _who_ _was_ _taking_ _it_ _for_ _a_ friend _and_ she _was_ _going to_ take _it_ _to_ _a_ friend's _and_ _i_ said _well_ _i_ _can_ _just_ charge _it_ [you] _know_ . 
A|6| B: _i think_ one of _the_ things _that's_ interesting [to] me _is_ _if_ [you] look particularly at _the_ political changes _is_ _that_ _the_ they seem _to be_ social they seem _to be_ economically driven also . 
B|7| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|8| B: so _if_ [you] look at russia [and] _what's_ happened over there _i think_ _the_ change _in_ _communism_ [was] as [a] result of _the economic_ problems _that_ they were experiencing . [and] of course [i] look at _the economic_ problems _in the_ united states [right] now . one of _the_ things [you] wonder _is_ _what_ _that's_ [going _to] do_ [to] us . 
B|9| M: _well_ [that's] true _that that_ [is] true _. i_ _i mean i_ _it_ _i don't know_ i'm _not_ sure [if] [the] soviet union itself _is going to be_ better off under [communism] _or_ _not_ _but_ [what's] [going] _on_ [in [the] economic] situation . 
A|10| B: _i think_ [the] other kind of changes like job changes [and] those kinds of things [i mean _i] think_ [it's] great [to] even _have_ three [or] four different careers [in] your life . 
B|11| M: [right] . 
A|12| B: _i think it_ must _have_ been terribly boring [to] go through your life doing [just] one thing [for] fifty years [or] forty years . 
B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: some of [that] opportunity [for] job change [in the] fact [that that] aspects changing . 
B|15| M: [right] . [right] . 
A|16| B: [and] [the] uncertainty of whether you're [going to] _have a_ job [is] [not] as _good_ [but] [the] fact [that] [you] really [can] make major changes [in] your life [and] jobs . 
B|17| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|18| B: _i think_ [it's] great . 
B|19| M: _yeah_ [i think it] [is] . 
A|20| B: oh [yeah .] 
B|21| M: [and] uh [and] [and] i'm [not] i'm _i don't_ [think] i'm getting [a] [good] _education_ [i think] [i] would _probably_ [be] better off [in] [a] larger school [but] [i] don'ely _know_ [what] [to do] _about_ [it] . 
A|22| B: [i think] one of [the] problems _with_ _with_ [education] as [it] relates [to] this though [is] _that [i_ don't _know] that_ [education] [is] prepared [to] help _people_ make those changes . [it] [just] seems _a lot_ of [the] training [and] [education] [that] goes [on] [is] gearing _people_ towards [a] profession [and] [not] giving them [the] skills [and] whatever those skills _are_ necessary [to] make those job changes which [i think] [is going to be] _a hard_ thing [for] [for] _people_ [to] face . 
B|23| M: [yeah] [i think] [i] don [i] agree [with] [you] [i] i've [i] [have [a] hard] time getting into [a] [a] [good] teaching field because [i think] [a lot] [a lot] [the] [people] [that i] [know that] _are [in_ the] [education] field _are in_ [that] field [and] uh [i] [know] [a lot] _who_ would _who_ wouldn't _who_ would benefit most from [a] [good] [education] . 
A|24| B: [yeah .] 
B|25| M: [and] [i] don tinker [with] [it] [but] [i think] [you] [know] . 
A|26| B: there [probably] needs [to be] some training [on] how [to] [to] [to] adjust [to] these changes as they come [about] [. [i] mean] [if] [you] look at [the] [the] high unemployment rate [right] now [and] [you] look at [people] [who] [are in] those situations [i don't [know] that] they [have] [good] coping skills [or] [a lot] of them even ideas of how [to] make those changes now . 
B|27| M: [right] . 
A|28| B: so [it] seems [to] me [that] while those changes [are] [taking] place maybe we're [not] [well] preparing [people] [to] make [the] changes [with] them . 
B|29| M: [well] [it's] [hard] [to] say . 
A|30| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| M: [and] uh
