B|4| M: _right ._ 
A|5| B: [right .] [but] [the] point is is [that] businesses do [that] .

A|9| B: [uh] , do [you] mean businesses from [the] point _of_ view as , _of_ , _of_ selling [things] [to] _a_ consumer [and] then being responsible [for] _the sales_ [tax] ? or purchasing . 
B|10| M: [i think] [it's] [, it's] [a] total waste [of] somebody's money . 
A|11| B: yeah . _see_ i'm unfamiliar with [that] because [i] [don't] [, i] never _see_ [that] end [of] [the] business . 
B|12| M: [well [,] you] [don't] [see] [it] [in] [, you] [see] [it] [on [the] sales] , [in] [the] _, uh_ [in] [the] mail ? 
A|13| B: so , my only experience has been from [the] point [of] view [of] [a] consumer .
