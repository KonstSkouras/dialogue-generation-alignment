B|2| M: _well i think_ [i think] [they] should have [the] ability [to] [to] _check_ _things_ like [that] [and i think] [it's] just [the] fact [that] [they] [they] [i] [believe they] [uh] [they] _check [for_ that] _but_ [they] [don't] actually _check for_ [for] [you] [i] [know] _uh ._ 
A|3| B: [well i think] [that] _if_ _if_ policy is established [and] _if_ _a_ mechanism is put into place [to] promote [the] collection _of_ taxes _in_ this fashion then [i] [don't] argue with _it_ . because [it's] _not_ _a_ burden _on the_ consumer [to] remember [that] oh [i] bought this out _of_ state . [i] need [to] xerox [the] receipt [and] make out _a_ [check for] six percent [and] send _it_ [to] pennsylvania . 
B|4| M: _right ._ 
A|5| B: [right .] [but] [the] point is is [that] businesses do [that] . [the] business [that] [you] purchase [the] thing from is responsible [for] collecting [the] appropriate _sales_ _tax_ [and] forwarding _it_ [to] [the] state _in_ question . that's _a_ cost _of_ doing business . [the] burden shouldn't be placed _on the_ consumer . 
B|6| M: yes . 
A|7| B: [uh .] 
B|8| M: [if] you're going [to] buy _something_ you're [not] going [to] [pay] [tax] [on] [on] [it] 
A|9| B: [uh] do [you] mean businesses from [the] point _of_ view as _of_ _of_ selling [things] [to] _a_ consumer [and] then being responsible [for] _the sales_ [tax] ? or purchasing . 
B|10| M: [i think] [it's] [it's] [a] total waste [of] somebody's money . 
A|11| B: yeah . _see_ i'm unfamiliar with [that] because [i] [don't] [i] never _see_ [that] end [of] [the] business . 
B|12| M: [well] [you] [don't] [see] [it] [in] [you] [see] [it] [on [the] sales] [in] [the] [uh] [in] [the] mail ? 
A|13| B: so my only experience has been from [the] point [of] view [of] [a] consumer . [uh] [but] [if] that's [the] case [if] [the] business is responsible [for] policing themselves then [i think] some [well] defined mechanisms need [to] be [in] place so [that] [uh] [the] opportunity [to] forget [that] [you] owe [sales] [tax] [for] [something] [uh] can be avoided . 
B|14| M: uh-huh .
