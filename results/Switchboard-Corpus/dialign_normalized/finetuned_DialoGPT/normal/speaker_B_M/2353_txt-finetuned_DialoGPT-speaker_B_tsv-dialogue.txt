A|32| B: uh-huh . 
B|33| M: [and] [it] _was_ [like] [the] only thing [that i] _ever_ taught _was_ assembly

B|35| M: _and , _um_ ._ 
A|36| B: uh-huh .

A|42| B: [it] [would] [really] [, um [,] and [i] don't] [the] _people that_ [i've] known [like] [from] germany [and] finland [that] [have] done _that _are_ ,_ [they] [do] military service [which] _, you know [, i_ don't] exactly recommend 
B|43| M: _uh ,_ 
A|44| B: [but] still [they] [have] benefited [from] _it ._ 
B|45| M: [yeah] _, _that's_ true ._ 
A|46| B: [and , [um _,] you] know ,_ although [i] wouldn't want [it] [to] make _people_ [to] [go] [off] [to the] military voluntarily [but] [it's , it] has helped [them] 
B|47| M: uh-hums . 
A|48| B: [and they] [are] [just] [a lot] more mature , than [the] average student 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [and] [like] she's washing 
B|51| M: _uh_ . 
A|52| B: uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [but] [i think] [they] did [a] [really] _good_ job [of] [that] . 
A|54| B: _well [,_ that's] [right .] [a lot _of] people_ [they] flunk [out] [or] [they] _get ,_ [they] [just] _get_ [so] excited [to be] away [from] home , [they] [just] spend [all] [there] time partying 
B|55| M: [yeah] , [yeah .] 
A|56| B: [and they] [do [a] lot of things] [to] _themselves_ _that , that_ [we] [really] [don't] want our _young people_ [to be] _doing_ 
B|57| M: _uh ,_ uh-hue . 
A|58| B: [and ,] 
B|59| M: [yeah .] 
A|60| B: [um .] 
B|61| M: _well , i , i don't [know_ _, i] guess_ [it's] [a] matter [of _,] uh [,_ [of] [,] of] different priorities [, i] suppose . 
A|62| B: [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [but _,] uh [,_ _you] can_ [, you] _could_ _say_ [you're] probably [right] _, [that ,_ [that] the] _, uh_ [the] government's probably _not_ [doing] itself any _good_ [, and] [that] [there's] probably [other] problems [that _,] uh_ 
A|64| B: _because_ [we're] [so ,] [we] love our freedom [and] our freedom [of] choice [and , um ,] having _people_ [like] 
B|65| M: uh-hue . 
A|66| B: [but _,] you know ,_ our , [like] [in] our church _, it [, it_ is] , your free [to do that] [or not] 
B|67| M: _uh_ . 
A|68| B: [you're] encouraged [to do] [it] _because [,_ [um _,] you] _know ,_ it , it_ helps [you [,] and [,] of] course , [we] [think it's] helping [other] _people_ . 
B|69| M: _uh ,_ [yeah] [, i think] [it is] . 
A|70| B: _and [so_ ,] 
B|71| M: [i think] [it [,] [and _i] think] [,_ and] [it's] _sad_ _, [because_ [,] you] see [so] _many_ [young [people] [that] are] [in] trouble [, [and] so] _many [people_ [that] [,] you] [don't] even [know] [it .] 
A|72| B: uh-huh . 
B|73| M: [and i think that] [it's] _a big_ problem . 
A|74| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|75| M:  !!!!,!! ; !! % !! remind me [of] [that] . 
A|76| B: _and they're_ preoccupied [with] , drinking . 
B|77| M: [right] [, [and] they're] , [they're] [in a] _, [in_ a] mental institution . 
A|78| B: uh-huh [. and] 
B|79| M: [yeah] [, and _,] uh_ . 
A|80| B: uh-huh . 
B|81| M: [and _,] uh_ [i [think] [it's] ,] [it's] interesting [that _, that] _,_ uh_ ... 
A|82| B: [that's true .] paper 
B|83| M: _uh _,_ but_ _i _,_ uh_ . 
A|84| B: [that's] [really] [true .] 
B|85| M: [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah .] [well , i , i don't know] how [that] [would] [ever] happen here [but] at least [, um ,] 
B|87| M: _uh _,_ [i know_ _,] uh _,_ uh_ [i ,] _my ,_ _my_ sister-in-law [is] [a] _, uh_ [a] _, a_ vietnam veteran [and] she _was in_ [the] _, uh_ [and] [it _,] i guess_ [it] _was_ [the] [, the] theater [or] whatever _, uh_ . 
A|88| B: [oh ,] [really] . 
B|89| M: [and _,] uh_ . 
A|90| B: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [and _,] uh_ . 
A|92| B: huh . 
B|93| M: [and _,] uh_ . 
A|94| B: [well , i] [have] seen [a big] change _, i think [,_ in] high school [kids] [that] [my] relatives [and] friends [, that [,] um [,] i know] [when [i] [was] in] high school [i] had an [idea] [of] [what] [i] [really] [wanted [to] do] [with] [what] [my ,] [what] [i was] [going to] study 
B|95| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|96| B: [and] at least [i] had [some] interest [in] [, a lot of] [the] youth [that i] come [in] contact [with] _are ,_ [they] [say] [oh [,] i] want [to be] [a] doctor [, i] want [to be] [a] lawyer . [why] ? [because] [they] make [a lot of] [money] . 
B|97| M: [right .] 
A|98| B: [and they] [don't [have] a] goal , [they] [don't [have] a] goal , [they] [don't have] an interest [in] their own field [of] study . 
B|99| M: [that's true] [, that] [is] [true [.] [i] don't know] [what] [they] call [it] [in] college [. [i] think] [they] call [themselves] institutions [of] [like] thirty [or] forty thousand [or] something [like that] . 
A|100| B: [they're] [just] looking _what's_ [going [to] pay] [the] biggest cash . 
B|101| M: [that's true] [, that] [is] [true _.] [that's_ true] [and [, and] _,] uh [,_ you know [, i] think _,] uh_ [and] [that's] also [true] [of _,] uh_ [you know] [a lot] [, a] whole [lot of] companies , [you're] [right] [, a] [, a] large percentage [of [people] [that] are] hired [are [,] you] [get _,] uh_ 
A|102| B: uh-huh . 
B|103| M: [and they're] [all] , 
A|104| B: yes . 
B|105| M: [i mean [,] i don't [know] , it , it] seems ridiculous [. [i] mean [,] you know ,] [what's] [the] solution . 
A|106| B: [there's] [just] [too] [many people] . uh-huh [. that's] [right .] [not] enough [people] want [to do that] [to] , [for] [, uh [,] because] [of] [a] service [that they] [could] provide . 
B|107| M: uh-uh . [yeah [.] [i] [think] [it's] ,] [it's] [a] shame [that] [there's] [so] [many people] who [are] uninsured [and] can't afford [to] [get] [a] , [to] [get] treatment [and to be] able [to] [get] [help] . 
A|108| B: [you know ,] [if] [you] want [to be] [a] lawyer [because] [you know] [that] [you can] provide [a] service [that] [people] need [because] [you have to have] lawyers [in] [this] country [, um [,] but] [if] [you're] [just] [doing] [it] [because] [you] [think that's] [the] best way [to] , [be] rich . 
B|109| M: [right .] 
A|110| B: uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [and [, and] [,] you know ,] [it's] [not] [just] [the] [money] [that's] available [, it is] [the] principle . 
A|112| B: [that's] [kind of] [sad] . [well ,] anyway . 
B|113| M: okay . 
A|114| B: [well [, i] guess] [i] [better] [go] . 
B|115| M: okay . 
A|116| B: [well ,] [good] luck [to] [you] [. i] enjoyed [it .]
