B|25| M: _uh_ [yeah .] 
A|26| B: _i mean_ teenagers [in] our country _are_ _kind of_ _kind of_ [a] year [that] parents [don't] [look] forward [to] [and and] _things _like_ that_ 
B|27| M: [yeah .]

A|30| B: uh-huh . 
B|31| M: [so] [you] _don't _have_ [to_ be] [you] can't [be] self-employed [and] _not_ _have a_ budget _you have to have_ _some_ [kind of] budget [and i _think] it's_ [really] important [to be] able [to do] [things like] _this_ . 
A|32| B: uh-huh . 
B|33| M: [and] [it] _was_ [like] [the] only thing [that i] _ever_ taught _was_ assembly 
A|34| B: [oh] [no .] 
B|35| M: _and _um_ ._ 
A|36| B: uh-huh . 
B|37| M: _and they_ were _just_ playing board games [and] _this_ [and] _that you_ [you] [would] see _them_ _all_ [in] [the] same room [you] never _could_ decide _which_ one [you] _wanted to_ play [on] . 
A|38| B: _right ._ uh-huh .

A|42| B: [it] [would] [really] [um] [and [i] don't] [the] _people that_ [i've] known [like] [from] germany [and] finland [that] [have] done _that are_ [they] [do] military service [which] _you know [i_ don't] exactly recommend 
B|43| M: _uh_ 
A|44| B: [but] still [they] [have] benefited [from] _it ._ 
B|45| M: [yeah] _that's true ._ 
A|46| B: [and [um] [you] know] although [i] wouldn't want [it] [to] make _people_ [to] [go] [off] [to the] military voluntarily [but] [it's it] has helped [them] 
B|47| M: uh-hums . 
A|48| B: [and they] [are] [just] [a lot] more mature than [the] average student 
B|49| M: [yeah .] 
A|50| B: [and] [like] she's washing 
B|51| M: _uh_ . 
A|52| B: uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [but] [i think] [they] did [a] [really] _good_ job [of] [that] . 
A|54| B: _well_ [that's] [right .] [a lot _of] people_ [they] flunk [out] [or] [they] _get_ [they] [just] _get_ [so] excited [to be] away [from] home [they] [just] spend [all] [there] time partying 
B|55| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|56| B: [and they] [do [a] lot of things] [to] _themselves_ _that that_ [we] [really] [don't] want our _young people_ [to be] _doing_ 
B|57| M: _uh_ uh-hue . 
A|58| B: [and] 
B|59| M: [yeah .] 
A|60| B: [um .] 
B|61| M: _well i i don't [know_ _i] guess_ [it's] [a] matter [of] _uh_ [of] [of] different priorities [i] suppose . 
A|62| B: [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [but] _uh_ _you can_ [you] _could_ _say_ [you're] probably [right] [that [that] the] _uh_ [the] government's probably _not_ [doing] itself any _good_ [and] [that] [there's] probably [other] problems [that] _uh_ 
A|64| B: _because_ [we're] [so] [we] love our freedom [and] our freedom [of] choice [and um] having _people_ [like] 
B|65| M: uh-hue . 
A|66| B: [but] [you know] our [like] [in] our church _it [it_ is] your free [to do that] [or not] 
B|67| M: _uh_ . 
A|68| B: [you're] encouraged [to do] [it] _because_ [um [you] _know] it it_ helps [you] [and] [of] course [we] [think it's] helping [other] _people_ . 
B|69| M: _uh_ [yeah] [i think] [it is] . 
A|70| B: _and so_ 
B|71| M: [i think] [it] [and i think] [and] [it's] _sad_ _because you_ see [so] _many_ [young [people] [that] are] [in] trouble [and so] _many [people_ _that] you_ [don't] even [know [it] .] 
A|72| B: uh-huh . 
B|73| M: [and i think that] [it's] _a big_ problem . 
A|74| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|75| M:  !!!!!! ; !! % !! remind me [of] [that] . 
A|76| B: _and they're_ preoccupied [with] drinking . 
B|77| M: [right] [and they're] [they're] [in a] [in a] mental institution . 
A|78| B: uh-huh [. and] 
B|79| M: [yeah] [and] _uh_ . 
A|80| B: uh-huh .

A|84| B: [that's] [really] [true .] 
B|85| M: [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [yeah .] [well i i don't know] how [that] [would] [ever] happen here [but] at least [um] 
B|87| M: _uh_ [i know] _uh_ _uh_ [i] _my_ _my_ sister-in-law [is] [a] _uh_ [a] [a] vietnam veteran [and] she _was in_ [the] _uh_ [and] [it] _i guess_ [it] _was_ [the] [the] theater [or] whatever _uh_ . 
A|88| B: [oh] [really] . 
B|89| M: [and] _uh_ . 
A|90| B: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [and] _uh_ . 
A|92| B: huh . 
B|93| M: [and] _uh_ . 
A|94| B: [well i] [have] seen [a big] change [i think] [in] high school [kids] [that] [my] relatives [and] friends [that] [um] [i know] [when [i] [was] in] high school [i] had an [idea] [of] [what] [i] [really] [wanted [to] do] [with] [what] [my] [what] [i was] [going to] study 
B|95| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|96| B: [and] at least [i] had [some] interest [in [a] lot of] [the] youth [that i] come [in] contact [with] [are] [they] [say] [oh] [i] want [to be] [a] doctor [i] want [to be] [a] lawyer . [why] ? [because] [they] make [a lot of] [money] . 
B|97| M: [right .] 
A|98| B: [and they] [don't [have] a] goal [they] [don't [have] a] goal [they] [don't have] an interest [in] their own field [of] study . 
B|99| M: [that's true] [that] [is] [true [.] [i] don't know] [what] [they] call [it] [in] college [. [i] think] [they] call [themselves] institutions [of] [like] thirty [or] forty thousand [or] something [like that] . 
A|100| B: [they're] [just] looking _what's_ [going [to] pay] [the] biggest cash . 
B|101| M: [that's true] [that] [is] [true _.] [that's_ true] [and and] _uh_ [you know [i] think] _uh_ [and] [that's] also [true] [of] _uh_ [you know] [a lot] [a] whole [lot of] companies [you're] [right] [a] [a] large percentage [of [people] [that] are] hired [are] [you] [get] _uh_ 
A|102| B: uh-huh . 
B|103| M: [and they're] [all] 
A|104| B: yes . 
B|105| M: [i mean] [i don't [know] it it] seems ridiculous [. [i] mean] [you know] [what's] [the] solution . 
A|106| B: [there's] [just] [too] [many people] . uh-huh [. that's] [right .] [not] enough [people] want [to do that] [to] [for] [uh] [because] [of] [a] service [that they] [could] provide . 
B|107| M: uh-uh . [yeah [.] [i] [think] it's] [it's] [a] shame [that] [there's] [so] [many people] who [are] uninsured [and] can't afford [to] [get] [a] [to] [get] treatment [and to be] able [to] [get] [help] . 
A|108| B: [you [know] if] [you] want [to be] [a] lawyer [because [you] know] [that [you] can] provide [a] service [that] [people] need [because [you] have to have] lawyers [in] [this] country [um] [but] [if] [you're] [just] [doing] [it] [because you] [think that's] [the] best way [to be] rich . 
B|109| M: [right .] 
A|110| B: uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [and and] [you know] [it's] [not] [just] [the] [money] [that's] available [it is] [the] principle . 
A|112| B: [that's] [kind of] [sad] . [well] anyway . 
B|113| M: okay . 
A|114| B: [well [i] guess] [i] [better] [go] . 
B|115| M: okay . 
A|116| B: [well] [good] luck [to] [you] [. i] enjoyed [it .]
