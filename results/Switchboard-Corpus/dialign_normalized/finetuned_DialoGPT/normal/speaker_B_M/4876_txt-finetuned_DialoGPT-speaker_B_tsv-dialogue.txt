A|0| B: _uh-huh ._ _well_ _i_ am _a_ working mother _i_ _have_ three children _and_ _my_ children , since _i _,_ _uh_ ,_ since they were very young , i've had various , um , different alternatives , _child_ care arrangements _and_ like most working mothers _i'm_ really _not_ defensive about it _. i_ personally feel _, _uh_ ,_ in our particular situation _, i'm_ _a_ much better mother when _i work_ out _of_ _the_ _home_ _and_ _my_ kids _, i think ,_ are very , very secure , _well_ raised children . _my_ comment on this _is that_ we paid an absolute fortune over _the_ years for _a_ variety _of_ opportunities . 
B|1| M: _well , i_ guess [, _i] mean_ _, _the_ _,_ the_ difficulty _with_ _that [is_ _that] [,_ uh] _you know_ _what_ [i'm] telling _you_ [is that] if , if _you're_ going _to_ _have a_ [child] who's going _to_ _be_ [a] _good_ parent _, you_ can't _just_ leave _them_ _at_ [home] . 
A|2| B: _so_ _i _, i_ _, i_ [,_ [you] know] , it [is] [a] problem . _and ,_ but as [you] pointed out _, i , i think_ [the] real problem [is] [the] low pay [child] facilities _and_ [that is] sometimes [what] some women who [have] [to] _work_ , [that is] all they can afford . when our children were very young , we had [a] pay _, a_ live in paid baby-sitter [that] was wonderful . 
B|3| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] _that ._ 
A|4| B: _and_ then as they got older , they went [to] [, _uh] [,_ i] preferred [to] call [them] schools _and_ they were really all day preschools _and_ they were wonderful . _and _i_ think_ they got exposed [to] [a] lot [of] neat _things ._ 
B|5| M: uh-uh . 
A|6| B: but we did , we really truly did pay [a] fortune _. i mean_ we were paying [at] one point , [well] about , about _a ,_ close , about _five_ hundred dollars [a] week for two children . 
B|7| M: wow . 
A|8| B: _so_ . 
B|9| M: wow . 
A|10| B: [well , i] [i'm] [a] physician . [uh] _and ,_ as [is] _my_ husband . 
B|11| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|12| B: _and ,_ _and i_ felt [, _uh] ,_ very [good] about working . [i'm] [a] pediatrician actually . 
B|13| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| B: _so_ [, _uh] ,_ but _i think_ there are some wonderful [child] care opportunities out there for children but , _and_ we all [know] [the] kind [of] _things_ [that] [you're] supposed [to] look for _. _i_ think ,_ 
B|15| M: [uh _,] what_ _type_ [of] [work] _do_ [you] _do_ ? 
A|16| B: _oh_ . [well] 
B|17| M: [i mean] [, i [,] i'm] [not] [a] career person [. i mean] [i'm] [, [i] work] full _time_ [and i] travel [, i] _do_ _that [,_ i] travel [and i] _do_ other [things .] 
A|18| B: _i think_ it's real important [that] [you] [have a] place [that ,] first [of] all parents [have a] lot [of] input into [and] [that] _they're_ always welcome [and] [that] they [have a] lot [of] activities where parents come in during [the] day [and] [that] [at] any [time] [you] can drop in . [and] we had [a] really wonderful arrangement [, [uh] [,] i'm] [with] [the] university actually 
B|19| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: [and] they had [a] wonderful [, [uh] ,] program [that] started [at] age three [and] it was about [a] block away from [the] hospital where [i work] . [and] _so_ , many times , [at] lunchtime [, i] would go over [and] visit [the] children [and] eat [with] [them] [and] _see_ [what] they were doing . [and] they had wonderful , they had [things] like gardens [and] lots [of] pets [and] [just] , they had [a] four [to] one [uh ,] teacher student ratio . 
B|21| M: [uh ,] that's _great_ . 
A|22| B: _so_ [that ,] [that] sort [of] an , most [of] [the] teachers had degrees . [uh ,] 
B|23| M: _yeah_ , _yeah_ [, i , i think] that's [a [,] a] [good] thing . 
A|24| B: _yeah ._ 
B|25| M: [and [,] uh] . 
A|26| B: it was incredible actually 
B|27| M: [oh] [, i] [know] . 
A|28| B: but it was [good] [. i mean] it was , it , [at] [that] [time] there were two children [and] they were in special programs [and] each one was [a] little over two hundred [a] week [and] then , in addition [, i] paid [a] little bit extra . but [the] kids were , 
B|29| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| B: [i mean] they really had some [great] opportunities . but [, what] [you] were alluding [to] earlier [is] [, [you] know] , women who [work] for minimal wage [and ,] [and] really [have] feel they [have] [to] put their children , 
B|31| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| B: sometimes they [do] put [them] in [, [uh] ,] fairly low paying situations . 
B|33| M: [yeah] _, i think [, i_ , i] agree [with] _that ._ 
A|34| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| M: [and ,] [you're] [not] going [to] [see] _that ._ 
A|36| B: [uh-huh .] no , even [that ,] [that] really [, i think , i] don't , it's been awhile since i've looked [at] _, my_ youngest [child] [is] eight . _so_ it's been [a] little while since i've looked into , actually daycare centers . but they are 
B|37| M: [yeah .] 
A|38| B: [you know] [, the] [good] ones [do] cost maybe sixty dollars [a] week since . 
B|39| M: [oh] [, my] goodness . 
A|40| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [so] that's [a] pretty [good] savings . 
A|42| B: something like [that .] 
B|43| M: [yeah] [, i think] [they're] up [to] [five] . 
A|44| B: [well [,] [you] know] , but [you] made [the] comment earlier , why would someone [be] interested in children [. i mean] it has been [a] real [, [uh] ,] there [have] been some [good] entrepreneurial [type] experiences . [and [i] think [, i] think] they [have] captured [a] certain market . again [the ,] but then there are baby-sitting groups . as [a] pediatrician , one [of] [the] [things] we've been real concerned about [is] [the] infections . 
B|45| M: uh-uh . right . 
A|46| B: as [you] start putting lots [of] little kids together [, the] infection rates [that] go around
