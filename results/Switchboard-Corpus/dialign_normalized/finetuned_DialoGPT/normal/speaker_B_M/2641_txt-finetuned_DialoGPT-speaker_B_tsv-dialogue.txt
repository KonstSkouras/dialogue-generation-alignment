A|0| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|1| M: _and_ _we_ _never_ _did_ _get_ _around_ _to_ cleaning _them_ _up_ , 
A|2| B: _yeah , i_ _like_ having cats [around] or _pets_ _around in_ general _i , i_ favor _dogs_ over cats actually _but ,_ 
B|3| M: _well _,_ i _,_ _you_ _,_ you_ _think _that_ _,_ you_ _don't _think_ that_ _a dog_ _can_ _really_ _take_ _on the_ responsibilities _of_ being _a_ parent _and _,_ and_ parent _, you_ _can't_ _really_ _be_ _a_ good parent _and_ expect _to be_ able _to take care of_ _your_ kids _and_ everything , 
A|4| B: _oh ,_ _i'm_ , _i'm_ [a dog] person . [i] _had _,_ i guess_ _it_ depends [on] what [you] _had_ _when_ he were [a] kid , _right_ ? 
B|5| M: _yeah ._ 
A|6| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| M: _but _, um _,_ i_ ,_ 
A|8| B: [but] _not_ cats . 
B|9| M: _no _,_ _no ,_ we_ _like _,_ um_ _we_ [like] _dogs ,_ _too_ . 
A|10| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| M: _and i_ _know_ _some_ _people _,_ um_ . 
A|12| B: [the] _thing_ _i don't like about_ [dogs] sometimes _is_ _that _the_ house_ will _just_ reek , [of] [the] [dogs [,] and] constantly . 
B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _yeah _,_ that's true ._ 
B|15| M: _you know _,_ _so_ , um_ . 
A|16| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| M: _and , um_ 
A|18| B: limited . 
B|19| M: [yeah ,] [but] _they're _,_ they_ _are_ _a lot_ [of] _fun_ . 
A|20| B: _oh _,_ really_ ? 
B|21| M: _and _,_ uh _,_ you_ _can_ _, _you_ _,_ you_ _don't have_ _to_ mess _with_ _that ._ 
A|22| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|23| M: _and _they_ have_ _this_ _little_ _plastic_ [thing] [that] fits _in the_ _back_ [of] _it ,_ 
A|24| B: _oh _,_ that_ sounds [so] easy , what [i] [did] , 
B|25| M: _yeah ._ 
A|26| B: _yeah , i_ housesat from cats _for_ [a] friend [of] mine which _she was_ finishing [up] her thesis , 
B|27| M: uh-oh . 
A|28| B: [and] what [we] _used to_ _do_ _was just_ _put_ [, um ,] newspaper [on the] bottom _and then_ _put_ _cat_ litter _and then i_ _would just_ [take] [the] whole [thing] _to the_ garbage [can] [and] dump [the] whole _thing ._ 
B|29| M: _uh_ . 
A|30| B: _then i_ _would_ _do_ [it _,] you know ,_ everyday or two days [so] [i] _would_ clean [that] pan _very , very_ rarely , 
B|31| M: _yeah ._ 
A|32| B: _and so_ [it] wasn't [so] bad . 
B|33| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: two cats [and] _just_ as easy _it just_ [never] started smelling [, i] _would_ _put_ _just_ _a little_ bit [of] _cat_ litter [in] _there_ _, because_ if [i] _put [a_ lot] _, one of_ [the] cats _would_ [have] been , 
B|35| M: [oh] . 
A|36| B: _all_ [of] her animals _that she_ _ever had_ were adopted . 
B|37| M: _uh_ . 
A|38| B: [i] [that] _true_ _, _yeah ._ yeah ,_ _she's_ even _got_ , _she's_ _got_ _one_ [dog] _now_ _and the_ two cats [and] her [dog] _there_ _is_ , _is_ basically [a] reject , somebody _had_ bought him [, and] wanted him . 
B|39| M: _oh , yeah ,_ uh-hue . 
A|40| B: _it was_ her ex boyfriend _and _, you_ know ,_ _just_ _was_ _not_ mature enough [to] keep [the] [dog] , didn't realize how much _work_ _it was_ [and] _now_ , _she's_ stuck [with] [it] . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [and] _she's_ _just_ [so] kindhearted _that she_ _just_ _takes_ _all the_ animals [but] _i think that_ _for_ _me_ _, well _,_ my_ husband _just_ has completely nixed [the] idea [of] having [a dog] or _a cat_ _because that's_ _all_ _there_ _is_ [to] [it] . _so _, you_ know ,_ 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: [no , we] [don't have] anything _right_ _now_ . 
B|45| M: [well [,] that's] good . 
A|46| B: [oh ,] _right_ , _now_ _we have_ [a] kid [but] he _was_ [, no ,] completely against having [a dog] or _cat_ , he _said _,_ they're_ much _, they're_ as much _work_ as [a] kid _, and they're_ harder _to get_ rid [of] _for_ [the] weekend [, [and] ,] 
B|47| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] _of _that_ [,_ _that] _,_ uh ,_ [dog] . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: [and then] [we] [put [a] little] fence _around the_ yard , _but it's not_ _like _,_ it's_ _like _,_ you know , it_ doesn't _, [it_ _,] it_ won't _do you_ any good [, and] _it's_ _, [it_ _just] _,_ it_ [takes] _too_ _long_ [to get] _out_ [and] [get] _back_ _in [the_ _house] _, and_ [i_ think] _it's_ [a lot] [of] _work ,_ 
A|50| B: _that's [,_ uh [,] yeah _,] really_ _true ._ [but] [like] [the] friends , _other_ friends [of] mine [have] cats [, [they] have] four _of _them_ , and_ if [they] go away [, [they] _have] [,_ they] hire [a] pet sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day [and] pet _them and_ things [like] [that] [and] their cats [, you know _,] _they're_ so_ _used _to_ the_ attention [, that] if [they] [don't] [get] [it [,] they] [get] [really] upset , 
B|51| M: [oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|52| B: _and [, _you_ know ,] they_ sort [of] cause trouble [around [the] house] [and] things [like] [that .] _i , i_ tried _to _have_ [,_ um ,] figured something having [, so] [i] tried _to have_ [a] goldfish , 
B|53| M: _oh [, yeah_ .] 
A|54| B: [and [, um] , i] killed [that] _one_ within [a] _very_ short amount [of] _time_ . 
B|55| M: [oh [,] my] _gosh_ . 
A|56| B: _right ._ 
B|57| M: [you] _can't_ [just] leave [them] _in the_ yard [and] leave [them] _out_ 
A|58| B: [my] brother _had_ fish _when_ [i] _was a_ kid [i] _remember_ [that [,] and] _one of_ his fish jumped [out] [of] _the [,_ um ,] [gosh] , what [do you] call [it ,] fish _tank_ . [and] fried itself , [on the] radiator behind [the] dresser . i'll [never] forget [that] _because_ [i] _remember_ [my] brother , he came home [and] he counted [the] fish 
B|59| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [and] _one of_ [the] fish _was_ missing [and they] couldn't find [it] anyplace [, they] couldn't figure [out] what _had_ happened [and then] [they] found [it] fried [on] _, the_ radiator behind . 
B|61| M: [oh [,] no] . 
A|62| B: _it was_ [not] gross [, i] didn't _see_ [it] [but , um ,] _got_ [them] . 
B|63| M: [i'm] sure [you] [did] . 
A|64| B: trying [to] _remember_ [we] _had_ [a dog] _for_ [a] while [, and _i] don't know_ if [we] _got_ rid [of] [the] [dog] _because_ [my] brother _was_ allergic [to] [it [,] my] brother _had_ asthma [and] [some] allergies which [i think] he's outgrown _now_ , 
B|65| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| B: [but] _because_ [of _that] we_ didn't [have] _very_ many _pets_ afterwards [and then] he _had_ fish . 
B|67| M: [uh] . 
A|68| B: [and] [you _,] they're ,_ [like] [you] _say_ _, they're_ [not] _the most_ exciting pet _to have_ . 
B|69| M: [no [,] no [,] no] . 
A|70| B: [well _,] a_ friend [of] mine _had [,_ um ,] an eel , 
B|71| M: _oh [, yeah_ .] 
A|72| B: [and then] he _had_ _a [,_ um , i] forget what type [of] fish _it was_ _, it was_ _one of_ these fish [that] [it] _would_ _eat_ [, it] ate [a] big _other_ fish [and] things [like] [that .] _there_ _would_ [be] sort [of] moby fish _in a_ _tank_ . 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [yeah [,] and] [it _,] i , i_ couldn't _see_ having fish [like] [that .] 
B|75| M: [well _,] i think_ _, [i don't_ _know] [, i_ guess] _it's_ _, it's_ [a lot] different [now] [that [we] have] [all the] conveniences [of] living [, you know ,] [when] _you have , you_ [don't have] [to] worry [about] _people_ getting _sick [,_ you] [get] [to] [know] [that] you're [not] alone , you're [in [a] _,] [in_ a] situation where _you have_ [to have] _people_ [around] [you ,] 
A|76| B: [i] _could_ _see_ [some] having , maybe [some] [of] [the] tropical fish [, that] [are] _really , really_ pretty [but ,] 
B|77| M: [right .] 
A|78| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|79| M: [and they] [would just] _kind of_ , you'd open [the] [tank] [up] [, and] they'd [eat] _the mice_ [, you] open [the] _bag_ [up] [, you] [get] [the [,] [the] [,] you] [got] [the] chance [to] [eat] [the [,] uh] [the] rats [, [and] the] grub [, [and] then] [you] [could] feed [them , and] [all] kinds [of] [other] stuff . 
A|80| B: [yeah .] 
B|81| M: [but [,] they're [,] _they] [,_ they] [are] [used to] running [around _in] the_ warehouse [with] [them [and] , you] [can] [see] [them] running [around] , you're [right .] 
A|82| B: [yeah [,] no [,] that] [would] [be] , what [did] [they] [do] , everyone come [around] [and] watch [them] . 
B|83| M: uh-uh [. yeah [,] well _,] [i don't_ know] . 
A|84| B: _i mean _,_ i guess that's_ fine if [you have] [a] mouse problem _at_ [your] frat [house , and] [your] things destroyed [the mice] . 
B|85| M: _oh [, yeah_ .] 
A|86| B: [but ,] 
B|87| M: [but] [that's _,] that's not_ [really] _fair_ . 
A|88| B: let's [see] [, i] _had_ [a] pet rat , _for_ [a] while [, and] _it _was_ a_ live rat [, [and] [, um] ,] [this] woman [just] offered [it] _to me_ while [i] _was_ [in] [, in] graduate school [and _,] _she_ was_ actually [a] _very_ [fun] pet . 
B|89| M: _oh [, yeah_ .] 
A|90| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [and [,] uh [,] _she] said_ [it [was] _just] [the_ most] wonderful [thing] [that she] [had] [ever [had] _,] and she_ [, she] [had] [never] owned [one] [, and i] _said , i_ [just] _want [to_ have] [one] [for] [my] kids . 
A|92| B: [yeah ,] mine [had] been [a _,] [a_ _,] a_ how [did] [this] [work _,] a_ mill rat [had] been bought [and _the] people_ [in the] lab [one] day called [in] [my] friend [and] [said [,] you know ,] [this] rat _is_ acting [really] strange [i think] he's [sick [,] and [she] [said] [, i] [don't] think] he's [sick [,] i think] _she's_ pregnant , 
B|93| M: [yeah .] 
A|94| B: [and they] [had] misclassed [the] sex [of] [back] _there_ _and [so [,_ um] [,] she] asked [me] if [i] [want to] _, one of_ those babies [, and i] took [the] baby [and i] [got] her [when] _she was_ [, you know ,] [just] [this] tiniest [little] [thing] [like ,] half [the] price [of] [a] mouse , 
B|95| M: uh-oh . 
A|96| B: [and then] [she] grew [to be] [, you [know ,] i] [had] pictures [of] her [when] [she] [would] sit [on] [my] hand [and then] [she] grew [to be] pretty big [, you know ,] [like] [a] pound or something 
B|97| M: [oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|98| B: [i don't know] how much [, and i] [had] her [for] over two years [and _she] was_ _very_ affectionate . [she] [would] [, you know ,] crawl [on] [me] [and she] [would] sit [like] [on] [my] neck or [my] shoulder while [i] [was] working [, and] things [like] [that [.] yeah ,] much more than [you] [would] [think] . 
B|99| M: [uh [,] i guess that's] [a] good [thing .] 
A|100| B: [yeah] [and ,] 
B|101| M: [well [,] i think] [that's] good . 
A|102| B: _yeah [, i_ ,] sort [of] weird [for] [me] [to have] [had] [one] [too] [but] _there_ _, it _was_ a_ convenient [little] pet [to have] _because_ [it] stayed [in] its cage [and [, you] know _, it] was_ easy . easy [to take care of] 
B|103| M: [yeah .] 
A|104| B: [and] [but ,] 
B|105| M: [well [,] [we] [have] ,] we've [had [,] uh [,] a] couple [of] different [pets] . [uh [,] one [of] them] [was [a] [,] uh] [a cat] [and [,] uh] [she [was] a] hamster . 
A|106| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: [you know , they] [say] [that the] hamsters [are] [the] best [pets] . 
A|108| B: actually [it was] more [fun] than [you] [would] [think] [. yeah ,] starting from [the] beginning [but , um [,] yeah [,] we] live , also live [in the] city [now] , actually [in] manhattan . 
B|109| M: [oh ,] okay . 
A|110| B: _and so_ [it's] almost impossible [to] [, [it's] not] [fair] [to] [a] pet [to have] [a] pet here , or certainly , certainly [not] [a dog] , 
B|111| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|112| B: _i mean ,_ [people] [do] , 
B|113| M: [well [,] that's true .] 
A|114| B: [but it's not] , 
B|115| M: [yeah [, i] think] [, [i] mean [,] [it] [,] it] seems [to me] [that [,] [that] _,] um , [the_ [,] the] only [thing] [that [,] you know [,] that] [i don't like about] [pets] [is] [when] [, [you] have] [to have] [them] 
A|116| B: [oh , yeah [,] you] [see] [all] these [people [,] yeah ,] these stately [people [,] and] [well] dressed [people] [out] walking their [dogs] [with] their [plastic] [bag] or their piece [of] paper [for] [them [,] it's] [really] [kind of] _funny_ . 
B|117| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! [that's [,] that's] [funny] [, [because] [that's] [,] i , i] [know] [a lot] [of] [people] who [work] [at] , [at] [, uh [,] uh] [at] [the [,] uh] [the] university [, [and] they] [say] [that [the] [,] [the] people] [that] [work] [there] [are] [very , very] nice . 
A|118| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|119| M: [and] [it's] _just [,_ it was] [really , [really] [,] i _, i] can't_ [remember] [the] word [, [it] just] bothered [me] . 
A|120| B: [right] [, no [,] they] [don't] . [i] should make [you ,] 
B|121| M: okay . 
A|122| B: [they [have] [,] um , the] bags behind [them] [but] [i think] [they're] actually supposed [to] , keep [them [,] yeah ,] keep [them] clean 
B|123| M: [oh ,] uh-hum . 
A|124| B: [but ,] [oh ,] [gosh] [, i can't] even walk by central _park_ [yeah] [when] summertime , [just the] smell [is] [so] bad [of] [the] horses . 
B|125| M: [yeah . yeah [,] yeah .] 
A|126| B: [oh [,] well [,] [it's] not] [that] [long] ago . [it was] , [oh ,] twelve times , [of] [the] year . 
B|127| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|128| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|129| M: [and [,] uh [,] [the] [,] the] weather [, [it] _just] [,_ [i don't] [know] , it] gets [so] hot [in the] summer [time] [, you know ,] 
A|130| B: [yeah .] 
B|131| M: [and [,] uh [,] we] went [to [the] [,] uh] [to the] [park] [and] playground . 
A|132| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|133| M: [and [i] think that] [was [a] lot] [of] [fun] . 
A|134| B: [yeah [,] that's not] [too] far from were [we] live , [do [you] have , you] [said] [you] [had] two cats , [are] [they [,] um ,] [just] what [you] call [it ,] [are] [they] breed cats or anything or [are] [they] [just ,] 
B|135| M: [no [,] no [,] no] . 
A|136| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|137| M: [they're [,] um] 
A|138| B: [uh-huh .]

A|140| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|141| M: [but] [she's] [, she] doesn't [know] [them] yet [, and [i] [, i] [,] [and] then i] [just] [get] [them] [when] [they're] young [, and [they're] so] cute , 
A|142| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|143| M: [and [so ,] you] [don't] [see] [them] [very] often . 
A|144| B: [they're] _both_ females ? 
B|145| M: yes . 
A|146| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|147| M: [they] [both] [have [,] uh [,] [very] , very] definite personalities
