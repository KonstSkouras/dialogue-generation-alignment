A|0| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|1| M: _and_ _we_ _never_ _did_ _get_ _around_ _to_ cleaning _them_ _up_ 
A|2| B: _yeah i_ _like_ having cats [around] or _pets_ _around in_ general _i i_ favor _dogs_ over cats actually _but_ 
B|3| M: _well_ [i] _you_ _you_ _think that_ _you_ _don't _think_ that_ _a dog_ _can_ _really_ _take_ _on the_ responsibilities _of_ being _a_ parent _and_ _and_ parent _you_ _can't_ _really_ _be_ _a_ good parent _and_ expect _to be_ able _to take care of_ _your_ kids _and_ everything 
A|4| B: _oh_ _i'm_ _i'm_ [a dog] person . [i] _had_ _i guess_ _it_ depends [on] what [you] _had_ _when_ he were [a] kid _right_ ? 
B|5| M: _yeah ._ 
A|6| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| M: _but _um_ i_ 
A|8| B: [but] _not_ cats . 
B|9| M: _no_ _no we_ [like] _um_ _we_ [like] [dogs] _too_ . 
A|10| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| M: _and i_ _know_ _some_ _people_ _um_ . 
A|12| B: [the] _thing_ _i don't like about_ [dogs] sometimes _is_ _that _the_ house_ will _just_ reek [of] [the] [dogs] [and] constantly . 
B|13| M: _yeah ._ 
A|14| B: [yeah] _that's true ._ 
B|15| M: _you know_ _so um_ . 
A|16| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| M: _and um_ 
A|18| B: limited . 
B|19| M: [yeah] [but] _they're_ _they_ _are_ _a lot_ [of] _fun_ . 
A|20| B: _oh_ [really] ? 
B|21| M: [and] _uh_ [you] _can_ [you] [you] _don't have_ _to_ mess _with_ _that ._ 
A|22| B: _uh-huh ._ 
B|23| M: _and _they_ have_ _this_ _little_ _plastic_ [thing] [that] fits _in the_ _back_ [of] [it] 
A|24| B: _oh_ [that] sounds [so] easy what [i] [did] 
B|25| M: _yeah ._ 
A|26| B: _yeah i_ housesat from cats _for_ [a] friend [of] mine which _she was_ finishing [up] her thesis 
B|27| M: uh-oh . 
A|28| B: [and] what [we] _used to_ _do_ _was just_ _put_ [um] newspaper [on the] bottom _and then_ _put_ _cat_ litter _and then i_ _would just_ [take] [the] whole [thing] _to the_ garbage [can] [and] dump [the] whole _thing ._ 
B|29| M: _uh_ . 
A|30| B: _then i_ _would_ _do_ [it] [you know] everyday or two days [so] [i] _would_ clean [that] pan _very very_ rarely 
B|31| M: _yeah ._ 
A|32| B: _and so_ [it] wasn't [so] bad . 
B|33| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: two cats [and] _just_ as easy _it just_ [never] started smelling [i] _would_ _put_ _just_ _a little_ bit [of] _cat_ litter [in] _there_ _because_ if [i] _put [a_ lot] _one of_ [the] cats _would_ [have] been 
B|35| M: [oh] . 
A|36| B: _all_ [of] her animals _that she_ _ever had_ were adopted . 
B|37| M: _uh_ . 
A|38| B: [i] [that] _true_ _yeah . yeah_ _she's_ even _got_ _she's_ _got_ _one_ [dog] _now_ _and the_ two cats [and] her [dog] _there_ _is_ _is_ basically [a] reject somebody _had_ bought him [and] wanted him . 
B|39| M: _oh yeah_ uh-hue . 
A|40| B: _it was_ her ex boyfriend _and [you_ know] _just_ _was_ _not_ mature enough [to] keep [the] [dog] didn't realize how much _work_ _it was_ [and] _now_ _she's_ stuck [with] [it] . 
B|41| M: [yeah .] 
A|42| B: [and] _she's_ _just_ [so] kindhearted _that she_ _just_ _takes_ _all the_ animals [but] _i think that_ _for_ _me_ [well] _my_ husband _just_ has completely nixed [the] idea [of] having [a dog] or _a cat_ _because that's_ _all_ _there_ _is_ [to] [it] . _so [you_ know] 
B|43| M: [yeah .] 
A|44| B: [no we] [don't have] anything _right_ _now_ . 
B|45| M: [well] [that's] good . 
A|46| B: [oh] _right_ _now_ _we have_ [a] kid [but] he _was_ [no] completely against having [a dog] or _cat_ he _said_ [they're] much [they're] as much _work_ as [a] kid _and they're_ harder _to get_ rid [of] _for_ [the] weekend [and] 
B|47| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] _of that_ [that] _uh_ [dog] . 
A|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: [and then] [we] [put [a] little] fence _around the_ yard _but it's not_ [like] _it's_ _like _you_ know it_ doesn't [it] [it] won't _do you_ any good [and] _it's_ [it just] [it] [takes] _too_ _long_ [to get] _out_ [and] [get] _back_ _in _the_ house _and_ [i_ think] _it's_ [a lot] [of] [work] 
A|50| B: [that's] [uh] [yeah] [really] _true ._ [but] [like] [the] friends _other_ friends [of] mine [have] cats [they have] four _of _them_ and_ if [they] go away [they have] [they] hire [a] pet sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day [and] pet _them and_ things [like] [that] [and] their cats [you know] _they're so_ _used _to_ the_ attention [that] if [they] [don't] [get] [it] [they] [get] [really] upset 
B|51| M: [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|52| B: _and _you_ know they_ sort [of] cause trouble [around [the] house and] things [like] [that .] _i i_ tried _to have_ [um] figured something having [so] [i] tried _to have_ [a] goldfish 
B|53| M: _oh [yeah_ .] 
A|54| B: [and [um] i] killed [that] _one_ within [a] _very_ short amount [of] _time_ . 
B|55| M: [oh] [my] _gosh_ . 
A|56| B: _right ._ 
B|57| M: [you] _can't_ [just] leave [them] _in the_ yard [and] leave [them] _out_ 
A|58| B: [my] brother _had_ fish _when_ [i] _was a_ kid [i] _remember_ [that] [and] _one of_ his fish jumped [out] [of] [the] [um] [gosh] what [do you] call [it] fish _tank_ . [and] fried itself [on the] radiator behind [the] dresser . i'll [never] forget [that] _because_ [i] _remember_ [my] brother he came home [and] he counted [the] fish 
B|59| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [and] _one of_ [the] fish _was_ missing [and they] couldn't find [it] anyplace [they] couldn't figure [out] what _had_ happened [and then] [they] found [it] fried [on the] radiator behind . 
B|61| M: [oh] [no] . 
A|62| B: _it was_ [not] gross [i] didn't _see_ [it] [but um] _got_ [them] . 
B|63| M: [i'm] sure [you] [did] . 
A|64| B: trying [to] _remember_ [we] _had_ [a dog] _for_ [a] while [and _i] don't know_ if [we] _got_ rid [of] [the] [dog] _because_ [my] brother _was_ allergic [to] [it] [my] brother _had_ asthma [and] [some] allergies which [i think] he's outgrown _now_ 
B|65| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| B: [but] _because_ [of _that] we_ didn't [have] _very_ many _pets_ afterwards [and then] he _had_ fish . 
B|67| M: [uh] . 
A|68| B: _and you_ [they're] [like you] _say_ [they're] [not] _the most_ exciting pet _to have_ . 
B|69| M: [no] [no] [no] . 
A|70| B: [well] [a] friend [of] mine _had_ [um] an eel 
B|71| M: _oh [yeah_ .] 
A|72| B: [and then] he _had_ [a] [um i] forget what type [of] fish _it was_ _it was_ _one of_ these fish [that] [it] _would_ _eat_ [it] ate [a] big _other_ fish [and] things [like] [that .] _there_ _would_ [be] sort [of] moby fish _in a_ _tank_ . 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [yeah] [and] [it] _i i_ couldn't _see_ having fish [like] [that .] 
B|75| M: [well] [i think] [i don't _know] [i_ guess] _it's_ _it's_ [a lot] different [now] [that [we] have] [all the] conveniences [of] living [you know] [when] _you have you_ [don't have] [to] worry [about] _people_ getting _sick_ [you] [get] [to] [know] [that] you're [not] alone you're [in a] [in a] situation where _you have_ [to have] _people_ [around] [you] 
A|76| B: [i] _could_ _see_ [some] having maybe [some] [of] [the] tropical fish [that] [are] _really really_ pretty [but] 
B|77| M: [right .] 
A|78| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|79| M: [and they] [would just] _kind of_ you'd open [the] [tank] [up] [and] they'd [eat] _the mice_ [you] open [the] _bag_ [up] [you] [get] [the] [the] [you] [got] [the] chance [to] [eat] [the] [uh] [the] rats [and the] grub [and then] [you] [could] feed [them and] [all] kinds [of] [other] stuff . 
A|80| B: [yeah .] 
B|81| M: [but] [they're] [they] [they] [are] [used to] running [around _in] the_ warehouse [with] [them [and] you] [can] [see] [them] running [around] you're [right .] 
A|82| B: [yeah] [no] [that] [would] [be] what [did] [they] [do] everyone come [around] [and] watch [them] . 
B|83| M: uh-uh [. yeah] [well] [i don't know] . 
A|84| B: _i mean_ _i guess that's_ fine if [you have] [a] mouse problem _at_ [your] frat [house and] [your] things destroyed [the mice] . 
B|85| M: _oh [yeah_ .] 
A|86| B: [but] 
B|87| M: [but] [that's] _that's not_ [really] _fair_ . 
A|88| B: let's [see] [i] _had_ [a] pet rat _for_ [a] while [and] _it _was_ a_ live rat [and um] [this] woman [just] offered [it] _to me_ while [i] _was_ [in] [in] graduate school _and _she_ was_ actually [a] _very_ [fun] pet . 
B|89| M: _oh [yeah_ .] 
A|90| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [and] [uh] _she said_ [it [was] _just] [the_ most] wonderful [thing] [that she] [had] [ever had] [and she] [she] [had] [never] owned [one] [and i] _said i_ [just] _want [to_ have] [one] [for] [my] kids . 
A|92| B: [yeah] mine [had] been [a] [a] [a] how [did] [this] [work] [a] mill rat [had] been bought [and _the] people_ [in the] lab [one] day called [in] [my] friend [and] [said] [you know] [this] rat _is_ acting [really] strange [i think] he's [sick] [and [she] [said] [i] [don't] think] he's [sick] [i think] _she's_ pregnant 
B|93| M: [yeah .] 
A|94| B: [and they] [had] misclassed [the] sex [of] [back] _there_ _and [so_ um] [she] asked [me] if [i] [want to] _one of_ those babies [and i] took [the] baby [and i] [got] her [when] _she was_ [you know] [just] [this] tiniest [little] [thing] [like] half [the] price [of] [a] mouse 
B|95| M: uh-oh . 
A|96| B: [and then] [she] grew [to be] [you [know] i] [had] pictures [of] her [when] [she] [would] sit [on] [my] hand [and then] [she] grew [to be] pretty big [you know] [like] [a] pound or something 
B|97| M: [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|98| B: [i don't know] how much [and i] [had] her [for] over two years [and _she] was_ _very_ affectionate . [she] [would] [you know] crawl [on] [me] [and she] [would] sit [like] [on] [my] neck or [my] shoulder while [i] [was] working [and] things [like] [that [.] yeah] much more than [you] [would] [think] . 
B|99| M: [uh] [i guess that's] [a] good [thing .] 
A|100| B: [yeah] [and] 
B|101| M: [well] [i think] [that's] good . 
A|102| B: _yeah i_ sort [of] weird [for] [me] [to have] [had] [one] [too] [but] _there_ [it _was] a_ convenient [little] pet [to have] _because_ [it] stayed [in] its cage [and [you] know [it] was] easy . easy [to take care of] 
B|103| M: [yeah .] 
A|104| B: [and] [but] 
B|105| M: [well] [we have] we've [had] [uh] [a] couple [of] different [pets] . [uh] [one [of] them] [was a] [uh] [a cat] [and] [uh] [she [was] a] hamster . 
A|106| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: [you know they] [say] [that the] hamsters [are] [the] best [pets] . 
A|108| B: actually [it was] more [fun] than [you] [would] [think] [. yeah] starting from [the] beginning [but um] [yeah] [we] live also live [in the] city [now] actually [in] manhattan . 
B|109| M: [oh] okay . 
A|110| B: _and so_ [it's] almost impossible [to] [it's not] [fair] [to] [a] pet [to have] [a] pet here or certainly certainly [not] [a dog] 
B|111| M: uh-uh . [right .] 
A|112| B: _i mean_ [people] [do] 
B|113| M: [well] [that's true .] 
A|114| B: [but it's not] 
B|115| M: [yeah [i] think] [i mean] [it] [it] seems [to me] [that] [that] _um the_ [the] only [thing] [that] [you know] [that] [i don't like about] [pets] [is] [when] [you have] [to have] [them] 
A|116| B: [oh yeah] [you] [see] [all] these [people] [yeah] these stately [people] [and] [well] dressed [people] [out] walking their [dogs] [with] their [plastic] [bag] or their piece [of] paper [for] [them] [it's] [really] [kind of] _funny_ . 
B|117| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! [that's] [that's] [funny] [because that's] [i i] [know] [a lot] [of] [people] who [work] [at] [at] [uh] [uh] [at] [the] [uh] [the] university [and they] [say] [that the] [the people] [that] [work] [there] [are] [very very] nice . 
A|118| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|119| M: [and] [it's] [just] [it was] [really really] [i _i] can't_ [remember] [the] word [it just] bothered [me] . 
A|120| B: [right] [no] [they] [don't] . [i] should make [you] 
B|121| M: okay . 
A|122| B: [they have] [um the] bags behind [them] [but] [i think] [they're] actually supposed [to] keep [them] [yeah] keep [them] clean 
B|123| M: [oh] uh-hum . 
A|124| B: [but] [oh] [gosh] [i can't] even walk by central _park_ [yeah] [when] summertime [just the] smell [is] [so] bad [of] [the] horses . 
B|125| M: [yeah . yeah] [yeah .] 
A|126| B: [oh] [well] [it's not] [that] [long] ago . [it was] [oh] twelve times [of] [the] year . 
B|127| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|128| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|129| M: [and] [uh] [the] [the] weather [it just] [i don't [know] it] gets [so] hot [in the] summer [time] [you know] 
A|130| B: [yeah .] 
B|131| M: [and] [uh] [we] went [to the] [uh] [to the] [park] [and] playground . 
A|132| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|133| M: [and [i] think that] [was [a] lot] [of] [fun] . 
A|134| B: [yeah] [that's not] [too] far from were [we] live [do [you] have you] [said] [you] [had] two cats [are] [they] [um] [just] what [you] call [it] [are] [they] breed cats or anything or [are] [they] [just] 
B|135| M: [no] [no] [no] . 
A|136| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|137| M: [they're] [um] 
A|138| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|139| M: [and they're] real spooky . 
A|140| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|141| M: [but] [she's] [she] doesn't [know] [them] yet [and [i] i] [and then i] [just] [get] [them] [when] [they're] young [and [they're] so] cute 
A|142| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|143| M: [and [so] you] [don't] [see] [them] [very] often . 
A|144| B: [they're] _both_ females ? 
B|145| M: yes . 
A|146| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|147| M: [they] [both] [have] [uh] [very very] definite personalities
