B|47| M: [right .] 
A|48| B: [and] _the_ polls are open [what] was [it] _a_ couple [of] weeks _the_ hours are good [and] [they're] even open [on] saturdays [and] _a_ couple [of] sundays . 
B|49| M: [uh] . 
A|50| B: [and] [so] we've got plenty [of] time [to] go [because] down here _in_ houston [it's] _uh the_ lines are long . 
B|51| M: [yeah .] 
A|52| B: [so] [uh] [but uh] 
B|53| M: [i [know] in] [in] [i [know] in] [the] dallas area [it] [it seems] [like] [uh [the] uh] 
A|54| B: [well] _uh i_ recommend [it] [because] [you] [just] walk [right] [on] [in] [and] there's usually [not] anybody [in] line 
B|55| M: [yeah .] 
A|56| B: [and uh] [you know that] vote's [just] as good as [you know] _the one_ [on] election day .

A|58| B: [uh-huh] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [you don't have to] wait until [the next] turn . 
A|60| B: _um_ [yeah i've] [been] involved with [uh some] [of] [the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of] [the] [of] [the] republican _party_ [. and] _it's really_ interesting _to see_ [the] process as far as [what] goes through as far as [the] voting [and] [the uh] how [the [uh] the] [not] [the] ballots [but uh] my mind [has] gone blank . [i've] [been] [all] evening how [they] develop [uh] [what] [the] candidate stands [for] 
B|61| M: [uh] 
A|62| B: [you know] [the] views [and uh] [you know] everybody gets [to vote] [on] [you know] [well] should [he] [be] [for] [this] [and] [on] [and] [on] [and] [on] [and uh] _it's it's_ interesting . 
B|63| M: [uh] uh-hau [yeah] [that's] [uh] . 
A|64| B: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [and uh] 
A|66| B: [right .] [there] [for] _a_ while [that] [would] [that] worked . we've _uh [i_ _know] i_ [have] _um_ i'll stick [to] [uh] [to] [the] [you know] sometimes i'll stick [to] _a_ certain _party_ depends [on] [the] guy . 
B|67| M: [uh i] guess i'd [have to] [say] [the one] thing [i [i] like] [to see] [is [uh] is] [the uh] [party] [system] [in] [in] texas _where_ [the _the] party_ [system] [is] [so] easy [to get] rid [of] . 
A|68| B: [but uh] if [it] [uh] gets down between two [then] i'll i'll [vote for] [the party] [because] [i know] [you know] [something about] [the] other guy 
B|69| M: [right] [right .] 
A|70| B: or [you know] [they're] [both] [just] as [bad] [and] i'll [say] [well [i] know what] [this] guy stands [for] as far as [for] his [party] [and] _um_ [but] [yeah .] [you know] [that's] [not] [the] best way [but] 
B|71| M: _no_ [i don't know _i] mean_ [i i] [do] [i] [just] [think] [it's [it's] really] [a] dumb [i] guess [uh] 
A|72| B: [but] [it] gets [to] [the] point [where] [i mean] you've got [to] [have] [the] find [the] time also [to] read [about] [the] guy [and and] [be] able [to] find [the] information [about] [what] [he] stands [for] . 
B|73| M: [yeah i think] [uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [right] or [what] you've heard _on t v_ which [i think] [is] [just] outrageous . 
B|75| M: [yeah .] 
A|76| B: [i [i] don't] [agree] with how _the media_ handles elections . 
B|77| M: [well [i] [i] think] [it's] [the media] [but [i] _think] [that_ [uh] i] [would] [like] [to see] them [uh] . 
A|78| B: [i] [you know] _i'm_ tired [of] hearing [about] [the] polls [you know] [you know] [this] [is] how [he] stands such [and] such [a] day [the] way [they] break [it] _out_ 
B|79| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|80| B: [it's] [just] [it's] [just] ridiculous . 
B|81| M: [well [i] _think] [that_ [uh] [i] [i] [know] that] [um] [i've] seen [a lot of] these [things] [on t v] [and i think] [they they] tend [to] sensationalize [things] [that] shouldn't [be] sensationalized . 
A|82| B: [uh-huh] [it] [really] could [and uh] [then] how sometimes how [the media] will blow [things] _out of_ proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] good [and] dead [and] [they] keep dragging [it] [on] [and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an election [for] [the] guy [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [right .] 
A|84| B: [yeah] [so] [uh] 
B|85| M: [i mean] [i'm] [not] saying [that] [it's] [not] going [to] [be] popular [but] [it's] certainly [not] going [be] popular either . 
A|86| B: _they really_ [do] . [i i] sometimes [think [that] that] should [be] limited [more .] 
B|87| M: uh-uh . 
A|88| B: [oh] yes or [they] [i] [agree] with [the] freedom [of] [the] press [you know] [and] [all] [the] amendments [but] sometimes [it's] [for] [the] public's own good [that [we] don't] hear [things] . 
B|89| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|90| B: [no] [they] [don't] . 
B|91| M: [i think that's] [that's] [a] shame [because] [they really] ought [to] [do] [something about] you're [right] [they] ought [to] [put] these [people] [in] jail [and] [then you] [you] can't expect them [to] you'll [you] won't [get] them [out of] jail [you] [might] [get] somebody 
A|92| B: [well i] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|93| M: [you] too [and uh] thank [you] [for] calling . 
A|94| B: [all] [right .]
