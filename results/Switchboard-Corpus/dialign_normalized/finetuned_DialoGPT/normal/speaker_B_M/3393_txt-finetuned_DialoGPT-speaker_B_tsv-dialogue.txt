A|44| B: [well] . 
B|45| M: [well [,] [that] , [that] was] [the [, _the] ,] uh [,_ the] big [freeze] [we had] . 
A|46| B: [uh [,] it ,] there's some trees [like] [the] oaks , [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] pretty hardy . there's , nothing bothers them . their leaves [are] still green , [and] some [of the] other oaks . there [are] [a] few oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . um [, what] [i] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [, that] [the] leaves [are] [just] dead [, the] dogwoods still look , still look [, you] [know] , they got [, uh ,] bit on [the] ends [of the] leaves [a] little bit [, but] they still look pretty good .
