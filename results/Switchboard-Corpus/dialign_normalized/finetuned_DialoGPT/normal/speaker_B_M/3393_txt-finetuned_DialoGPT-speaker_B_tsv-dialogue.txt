B|7| M: _oh_ _i_ didn't _know_ _that_ . 
A|8| B: _really_ ? huh . _it really_ [has been] strange here _this_ _year_ [i] mean _this_ whole course _this_ whole _year_ [has been] [a] _different_ _year_ in more ways than _one_ . 
B|9| M: uh-uh _. yeah_ [it] [it] seems [like] _it's_ _going to be_ [uh] it'll _be_ [different] [this] _time_ _of_ [year] though . 
A|10| B: _but uh_ _we had_ _uh you_ [know] all these _we_ _have_ all these [uh] somebody said _you_ [know] you're either [a] stranger or [a] fool [to] try [to] predict texas weather _but_ . _well_ always they were saying [it] _was_ [going to be] _the_ hottest summer ever 
B|11| M: [uh] . 
A|12| B: [and] _we had_ all [this] rain [and] _it really_ _is_ _not_ [a] _bad_ summer at all _really_ cool . _but_ all [of] [a] sudden in in [uh] in october [uh] september october [it] got _real_ hot [and] dry [and] _just_ stayed [that] way for [a] long [time] . [and] [uh] then _the_ end [of] october [it] started rain almost [a] week without stopping _just_ pouring down _you_ [know] . there were flash floods everywhere [that] kind [of] deal [and] then [uh] into [of] november _the_ first [like] _the_ second week _uh you_ [know] _the_ first week actually _we had_ _we [had_ a] _freeze_ 
B|13| M: [yeah .] 
A|14| B: [and] _the_ average _you_ [know] _the_ average [uh] first frost _is_ [like] _the_ fifteenth [of] november here 
B|15| M: [yeah .] 
A|16| B: _but_ usually [it's] _not_ until later [it's] _really_ strange . 
B|17| M: [uh] _i'm not_ [real] _sure what_ day _what_ day _it is_ [but uh] . 
A|18| B: [yeah .] 
B|19| M: [but uh] . 
A|20| B: [is] [it is] [it is] [it] flooding anywhere ? 
B|21| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: [it's] _just_ kind [of] [uh] we're supposed _to have a_ chance [to] get some rain _the_ next couple [of] days here [uh] which will [be] _you_ [know] [a] little bit more typical [uh] autumn weather . [but] _really_ [it's] strange . _we_ haven't _really_ [had] an autumn . [it's] [like] _we_ went into winter 
B|23| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|24| B: _you_ [know] _the_ poor trees said [what] 
B|25| M: [well] [what] [what] _are_ [you] [what] do [you] _think_ [is] causing _it ?_ 
A|26| B: [yeah] [uh] [it's] [yeah] there [you] [you] [know] usually there's [uh] [i] _have a_ farm [a] hundred miles east [of] here in east texas [and] [you] [know] all these huge trees _just_ [like] _the_ eastern hard wood belt all _the_ way up [to] maine [you] [know] [it's] [that] same trees pines [and] [and] hard woods [you] [know] hickories [and] oaks [and] stuff 
B|27| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: [and] [uh] _i was_ up there last weekend [and] there [are] trees _that that_ still _have_ their leaves on [and] they're green [but] they're dead [you] [know] _the the_ _freeze_ _just_ got them . they they weren't ready for [it] at all apparently [and] [and] _we_ haven't [had a] typical fall at all . [not] much color [you] [know] changes _have_ occurred at all . _really_ weird [this] [year] . [i'm not] [sure what] [that] [what] [that] means . 
B|29| M: _oh_ [no] [i'm] [sure what] [it is] [i] [just] remember [uh] . 
A|30| B: so [you] [you] all actually [had] some color huh ? 
B|31| M: [well] [we did] [uh] . 
A|32| B: [it] kind [of] crept in [and] 
B|33| M: [it] [it] [did] [it really] [did] . 
A|34| B: [yeah] [it's] usually _beautiful_ up there isn't [it ?] 
B|35| M: [it's] _beautiful ._ 
A|36| B: gorgeous . _that's_ [you] [know] [i] [think] [you] could drive along in maryland [and] look at _the_ sweet gum trees on each side [and] _the_ [and] _the_ pines [and] [what] [not] [and] [you] could [you] [know] [you] could [be] driving along in east texas [and] looks [just] _the_ same . [it's] almost [you] [know] identical kind [of] country . 
B|37| M: [uh] 
A|38| B: [beautiful .] 
B|39| M: [yeah] [that's] [that _that] was_ [one] _of the_ things [i was] thinking about too [was] [uh you] [have] [to have a] certain amount [of] rainfall . 
A|40| B: [yeah .] [oh] [. yeah] [i was] up [i was] up there cutting some firewood [this] weekend so . 
B|41| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|42| B: little little oak tree [that was] dead [and] cut [it] up [and] split [it] . 
B|43| M: [oh] [that's] [not] too [bad] . 
A|44| B: [well] . 
B|45| M: [well] [that [that] was] [the _the] uh_ [the] big [freeze] [we had] . 
A|46| B: [uh] [it] there's some trees [like] [the] oaks [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] pretty hardy . there's nothing bothers them . their leaves [are] still green [and] some [of the] other oaks . there [are] [a] few oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . um [what] [i] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [that] [the] leaves [are] [just] dead [the] dogwoods still look still look [you] [know] they got [uh] bit on [the] ends [of the] leaves [a] little bit [but] they still look pretty good . 
B|47| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|48| B: [it] [just] depends on [the] on [the uh] on [the] tree .
