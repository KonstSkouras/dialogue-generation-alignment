B|4| M: uh-huh . 
A|5| A: yes . _that ,_ [that] was _true_ for mine too . [uh] , although [i] _i'm sure_ [to] some extent , [that] _money_ [is] part [of] [the] problem [in] [the] disparity [, but [i] don't] _think [,_ i] honestly [don't] _think_ _that's_ [the] biggest part _of it ._ _you know _,_ i think_ _that , uh_ _, i mean i_ [know] [that] [in] my [town _,] _you_ know ,_ most [of] [the ,] most [of] [the] parents , they're valued education . 
B|6| M: uh-huh . 
A|7| A: [and , uh] _you know [,_ and] so [the] students were _, _you_ know ,_ [to] some extent , motivated [to] learn . 
B|8| M: _yeah , that's true ._ 
A|9| A: [i mean] [know] 
B|10| M: [you know ,] 
A|11| A: [yeah , that's true .] [but] [but] [, uh] _, i think _,_ i mean_ even _more_ than _that ,_ even _, i mean_ if [you] drop out [in] high school [you] should still be able [to] read [you know] ? [which] [it] [i mean] [it] sounds _like_ [, uh] , 
B|12| M: [yeah] 
A|13| A: now _i think_ maybe it's started changing [in] [the] past few years because [, uh] , _they_ [have] [of] these [, uh] , sort [of] mandatory tests if [you] [have] [to] take before _you get_ [a] diploma . 
B|14| M: [yeah] 
A|15| A: [but] [, uh] [, but] [, uh] , certainly before _that ,_ there were people _that _,_ [you_ know ,] would graduate from high school [and] _could_ barely read . [uh] [, and] [that's] just sort [of] inexcusable [and] [you] can't really [, i _, i] , i mean i_ just can't even picture _how_ [that] _could_ happen . [you know ,] except maybe [to] someone whose _, [you_ know ,] really badly learning [, uh] , disabled or something . 
B|16| M: [yeah .] 
A|17| A: [but] these people obviously weren't . 
B|18| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] 
A|19| A: [yeah .] 
B|20| M: [and , uh] 
A|21| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|22| M: [and] [i'm sure] [that , uh] ... 
A|23| A: [yeah [.] _and] _i_ think_ [that's] almost [a] bigger factor , than anything else probably . [i mean [, i] don't] _, i think_ [you know ,] people just , 
B|24| M: [yeah ,] _well [,_ i , i mean i] don tinker with drugs [, but [i] [,] uh] _i do [,_ uh] 
A|25| A: [yeah [.] and ,] again [, i don't] [, i mean] got [know] [the _,] [you_ know ,] _how_ qualified [, [i mean] _, i] think_ it'd be interesting [to _,] [you_ know ,] [to] spend [a] couple [of] days just looking around an inner city school . [uh] _, [you_ know ,] sort , sort [of] maybe from elementary through [, uh] , high school . [you know ,] just sort [of] [to] _get_ [a] feel for what it's _like_ . 
B|26| M: uh-huh . uh-hue . 
A|27| A: _i think_ that'd be an interesting experience . [but] [, uh] [, [i] haven't] done [that] 
B|28| M: [yeah [,] i ,] i've heard [of it .] 
A|29| A: [but [i] do [,] [i] do] _think_ [that , uh] [, [i mean] ,] _public_ education [in] general _i think_ can work [. _and] _i_ think_ it's [a] good thing . 
B|30| M: [yeah .] 
A|31| A: [yeah .] 
B|32| M: [and] [i'm] not [sure] [how] _well_ [that] [is] . 
A|33| A: yes . 
B|34| M: [and] [they] _could have_ had [a] lot [more] [money] . 
A|35| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] [i mean [, i] don't] [, i] honestly [don't] really _think_ [i] [could have] _, [you_ know ,] done much better than [i] did [in] [the] school system [i] was [in] . [mean] 
B|36| M: uh-huh . 
A|37| A: [yeah .] 
B|38| M: [and i] don [, i think ,] i'd [like] [to] see them [, i] wish they'd _start_ with [, you] , first [of] _all_ [you get] _into_ [the [,] uh] [public] schools [, and] _then_ [you get] [to] [the] private ones . 
A|39| A: [yeah .] [i mean [,] and] [and] [in] [the ,] once [you] junior high [, uh] , [start] junior high , starting [in] eighth grade [all] [the] way through high school , there were four levels [. well ,] no [, i] guess [it] [in] junior high , [it] was still three . [then] [in] high school [it] changed [into] four levels [of] [, uh] , [of] instruction [in] [the] major subjects . [uh] [, which] , 
B|40| M: uh-huh . 
A|41| A: [i mean ,] actually [i think] [that] works pretty [well] [. and] [that ,] [that] makes ,
