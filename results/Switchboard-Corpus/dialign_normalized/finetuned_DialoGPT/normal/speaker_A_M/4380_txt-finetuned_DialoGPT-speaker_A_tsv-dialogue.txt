B|0| M: _yeah ._ 
A|1| A: _i_ got _a friend_ who _goes_ there by _the_ way _i_ want _to_ talk _to_ _you_ _about_ _that_ afterward okay . 
B|2| M: _yeah _._ well_ [i] _have_ [a friend] [that] [goes] [to] tech also _and uh_ she [goes] [to] _uh_ [the] _uh_ [to] [the] university _of_ small _town_ _which_ _is_ _in_ wichita falls _. _and_ _uh_ i mean _i_ _i_ don't_ _know_ i've heard [about] _it_ _but _i_ haven't_ heard [about] [the] program . 
A|3| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] was [a] [a] it's _more_ or less [a] suburban school system ? 
B|4| M: uh-huh . 
A|5| A: yes . [that] [that] was _true_ for mine too . [uh] although [i] _i'm sure_ [to] some extent [that] _money_ [is] part [of] [the] problem [in] [the] disparity [but [i] don't] _think_ [i] honestly [don't] _think_ _that's_ [the] biggest part _of it ._ _you know_ _i think_ _that [uh_ i mean i] [know] [that] [in] my [town] _you know_ most [of] [the] most [of] [the] parents they're valued education . 
B|6| M: uh-huh . 
A|7| A: [and uh] _you know_ [and] so [the] students were _you know_ [to] some extent motivated [to] learn . 
B|8| M: _yeah that's true ._ 
A|9| A: [i mean] [know] 
B|10| M: [you know] 
A|11| A: [yeah that's true .] [but] [but] [uh _i] think_ [i mean] even _more_ than [that] even [i mean] if [you] drop out [in] high school [you] should still be able [to] read [you know] ? [which] [it] [i mean] [it] sounds _like_ [uh] 
B|12| M: [yeah] 
A|13| A: now _i think_ maybe it's started changing [in] [the] past few years because [uh] _they_ [have] [of] these [uh] sort [of] mandatory tests if [you] [have] [to] take before _you get_ [a] diploma . 
B|14| M: [yeah] 
A|15| A: [but] [uh] [but] [uh] certainly before [that] there were people [that] [you know] would graduate from high school [and] _could_ barely read . [uh] [and] [that's] just sort [of] inexcusable [and] [you] can't really [i _i] i mean i_ just can't even picture _how_ [that] _could_ happen . [you know] except maybe [to] someone whose [you know] really badly learning [uh] disabled or something . 
B|16| M: [yeah .] 
A|17| A: [but] these people obviously weren't . 
B|18| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] 
A|19| A: [yeah .] 
B|20| M: [and uh] 
A|21| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|22| M: [and] [i'm sure] [that uh] ... 
A|23| A: [yeah [.] _and] _i_ think_ [that's] almost [a] bigger factor than anything else probably . [i mean [i] don't] _i think_ [you know] people just 
B|24| M: [yeah] _well_ [i i mean i] don tinker with drugs [but i] [uh _i] do_ [uh] 
A|25| A: [yeah [.] and] again [i don't] [i mean] got [know] [the] [you know] _how_ qualified [i mean _i] think_ it'd be interesting [to] [you know] [to] spend [a] couple [of] days just looking around an inner city school . [uh] [you know] sort sort [of] maybe from elementary through [uh] high school . [you know] just sort [of] [to] _get_ [a] feel for what it's _like_ . 
B|26| M: uh-huh . uh-hue . 
A|27| A: _i think_ that'd be an interesting experience . [but] [uh [i] haven't] done [that] 
B|28| M: [yeah] [i] i've heard [of it .] 
A|29| A: [but [i] do] [i do] _think_ [that [uh] i mean] _public_ education [in] general _i think_ can work [. _and] _i_ think_ it's [a] good thing . 
B|30| M: [yeah .] 
A|31| A: [yeah .] 
B|32| M: [and] [i'm] not [sure] [how] _well_ [that] [is] . 
A|33| A: yes . 
B|34| M: [and] [they] _could have_ had [a] lot [more] [money] . 
A|35| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] [i mean [i] don't] [i] honestly [don't] really _think_ [i] [could have] [you know] done much better than [i] did [in] [the] school system [i] was [in] . [mean] 
B|36| M: uh-huh . 
A|37| A: [yeah .] 
B|38| M: [and i] don [i think] i'd [like] [to] see them [i] wish they'd _start_ with [you] first [of] _all_ [you get] _into_ [the] [uh] [public] schools [and] _then_ [you get] [to] [the] private ones . 
A|39| A: [yeah .] [i mean] [and] [and] [in] [the] once [you] junior high [uh] [start] junior high starting [in] eighth grade [all] [the] way through high school there were four levels [. well] no [i] guess [it] [in] junior high [it] was still three . [then] [in] high school [it] changed [into] four levels [of] [uh] [of] instruction [in] [the] major subjects . [uh] [which] 
B|40| M: uh-huh . 
A|41| A: [i mean] actually [i think] [that] works pretty [well] [. and] [that] [that] makes
