B|36| M: _right ._ 
A|37| A: [and ,] yes _, you're_ [right] _, _i think_ it's_ _a_ sixties program _. [i_ think] [it] was one _of_ kennedy's hot points _that_ he _, that_ was his _big_ deal . 
B|38| M: uh-huh . 
A|39| A: _right . right ._ [um] _, i think_ _i ,_ i've singled [out] my grandchildren [and] [but] actually _they're_ , _they're_ pretty _good_ , along those lines [as] compared _to_ what [i] _have_ _seen_ from _other_ people's children [and] grandchildren , mine aren't _really_ _that_ bad , 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [but] at _the same_ _time_ [i think] [it] _would_ _do_ [them] _a_ world _of_ _good_ . 
B|42| M: [uh , [i] don't [know] [,] i [,] _it's] , it_ seems [to] me [that _,] uh , _the_ more_ [i think] [about] [it] [, uh] ... 
A|43| A: [but] there's _a_ , 
B|44| M: _well [,_ [i] don't know] . 
A|45| A: mandatory _just_ _like_ , _like_ [the] draft . [no .] 
B|46| M: [i , i] agree _with_ [you] _there_ _. _i , i_ think [that_ [,] uh [,] [that] , that] [would] [be] _a good_ idea . 
A|47| A: every _time_ [you] , _they_ could buy _their_ way [out] . 
B|48| M: [yeah] . 
A|49| A: [right] _, [you_ know ,] _they_ , they'd figure [a] way around [that] one _in_ [a] heartbeat . [but ,] i'm wondering if there's another issue here [, and] maybe _this_ _is_ why _this_ has died [out] . _can_ [you] _go_ into [, and] _this_ wasn't [the] question [but] [it's , it] may _be [the_ more] _of_ [the] issue versus should young adults , _can_ _they_ _go_ _in_ [there] [and] _can_ anyone _go_ into , [well ,] [out] _of_ [the] kurdish community _is_ [a] little bit extreme at _this_ _time_ , [but] say [, i think] bangladesh [would] _have_ been [a good] example or some , some _really_ desperate situation [and] teach _them to_ farm [and] teach [them] [and] [it] doesn't _do_ any [good] . 
B|50| M: uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [i don't know] [that] [it] does [. i [, i] ,] [don't know] [that [,] um] , if [you] step back from [the] current issue [and] look at [it] [more] intellectually , _there are_ forever over , [as] long [as] we [know] _there are_ races _of_ people [that] _are_ dropping [out] . 
B|52| M: uh-huh . 
A|53| A: [you know ,] we're losing certain , races _of_ people . 
B|54| M: [right .] 
A|55| A: _there are_ people now [that] _are_ obsolete point [and] fact _just ,_ _just_ _like_ endangered species _of_ animals , _so_ _there are_ quote tribes _of_ people [, that] _are_ endangered or obsolete . 
B|56| M: [huh .] 
A|57| A: [and] i'm _just_ wondering if _you're_ fighting [a] natural process [there] _of_ being winnowed [out] . there's [a] german word [for it] [that's] elegant , [but] [i] never _can_ remember what [it] was [, uh ,] [but ,] [but] [that] _they're_ , _they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ , where _they_ _are_ _they're not_ adapted [to] _their_ environment essentially . 
B|58| M: [right .] 
A|59| A: [um] [, and] one _of_ [the] quick examples _is_ [the] aborigines . 
B|60| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|61| A: [uh ,] when we were _in_ australia [, uh ,] sad little _things_ . [uh , i] felt sorry [for] [them] . _because_ _their_ society isn't [there] anymore [, and] _their_ belief system [and] _all_ _their_ structured [of] theirs , _all the_ structures [of] _their_ society _are_ gone , essentially . 
B|62| M: [oh , really] . 
A|63| A: _and they're_ _just_ kind [of] [more] _like_ [a] side show than anything else [and] [that's] sad . 
B|64| M: [well [,] i] guess [i] haven't [really] [seen] [too] much [of] [it] lately . 
A|65| A: [but] [i don't] [think] there's any way [you] could _go_ [, uh , the] peace corps could _go_ _in_ [and] rescue those people [, _and] [i_ don't] [think] [you] could _have_ done [it] fifty or [a] hundred years ago either . 
B|66| M: _no ,_ [no .] 
A|67| A: _so [,_ i ,] i'm wondering if [the] peace corps _is [,_ really] _an_ effective tool . 
B|68| M: [i don't know] . 
A|69| A: [good] point . we've [got] _enough_ without without [a] passport there's plenty . 
B|70| M: uh-huh . 
A|71| A: yes [. [i] think] we ought [to] worry [about] our own species . 
B|72| M: [i think] [so ,] [too] [. i [,] [uh ,] i _think] the , the_ [other] _thing_ [that's] [interesting] [, uh] . 
A|73| A: [i] wonder now _in_ [, and] i've been [out] [of] school [too] long [to] answer _this ,_ [but] [i] wonder if [there] aren't some sociology courses . 
B|74| M: [well _,] i , i think_ [there are] [. i [,] uh [,] have a] son who's graduating [, and] he's [not] even yet old [enough] [to] _, to_ even get involved . 
A|75| A: [that's] [the] last [thing] _you want_ [, _to] do_ . 
B|76| M: [and [,] uh [,] you] [think] [of] [all the] [things] [that [,] [you] [want] [to] do] [, you] [would] [like] [to do] [in] your spare [time] . 
A|77| A: [yeah ,] [that's] exactly [it .] 
B|78| M: [and _they're] not going to_ pay [for [it] [.] and [i think] it's] _going [to_ be] [a] [big] [problem] [for] [the] kids , [because [,] you're] encouraging [them to] rebel [, you] [don't [know] [,] you] [just [,] you] can't [do] [this] [and] [you're] _going [to_ do] [this [,] and] [you] [can] [not] [do] [that [,] [and] [it's] _not] going_ [be [the] same] [for] [the] parents . 
A|79| A: [they're not going to] take [that] money [you] give [them] [and] _go_ try [to] figure [out] [a] way [to] dry [out] [with] [it .] now come on , let's [be] realistic , 
B|80| M: uh-huh . 
A|81| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|82| M: [well [,] [that] , [that] [is] [,] that] [would] [be] [an] [interesting] concept . 
A|83| A: [right .] 
B|84| M: [and] then , then [they] [can] [go] [out] [and] [do] [their] [thing] [and they] [can] make [themselves] wealthy . 
A|85| A: [no ,] we're [not] [i don't] [think] [. [i] think ,] [that's] [more] realistic than making [them] [go] [in] [the] peace corps . 
B|86| M: [yeah] . 
A|87| A: [i think] [that's] [a] lot [more] realistic . [uh [, [i] , i think] that] we should [be] spending [more] [time] [and [,] and] again [i don't] [think the , the] peace corps [is ,] [is] [as] successful now simply [because] [it's not] . [it] doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|88| M: [right . right .] 
A|89| A: [uh ,] we've [got] plenty , [in] fact , we've [got] [far] [too] many . [you're] [in] [, uh ,] what flower mound ? 
B|90| M: uh-huh . 
A|91| A: [i] was , [that's] exactly what [i] was [going to] ask [you] . [have] [you] ever [, have] [, have] [you] been downtown
