B|20| M: uh-huh . 
A|21| A: _right_ _you know_ if if we had some _really_ major health _problem_ _that_ required _a_ specialist we could find one [it] wouldn't _be_ convenient

A|31| A: [i] _want to_ believe _they_ _go_ into _other_ countries [and] teach _them_ how _to do_ _things_ _like_ farm [uh] dig _their_ own wells set up _their_ schools . 
B|32| M: uh-huh . 
A|33| A: yes . _they_

B|36| M: _right ._ 
A|37| A: [and] yes _you're_ [right] _i think it's_ _a_ sixties program _. [i_ think] [it] was one _of_ kennedy's hot points _that_ he _that_ was his _big_ deal . 
B|38| M: uh-huh . 
A|39| A: _right . right ._ [um] [i think] [i] i've singled [out] my grandchildren [and] [but] actually _they're_ _they're_ pretty _good_ along those lines [as] compared _to_ what [i] _have_ _seen_ from _other_ people's children [and] grandchildren mine aren't _really_ _that_ bad 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [but] at _the same_ _time_ [i think] [it] _would_ _do_ [them] _a_ world _of_ _good_ . 
B|42| M: [uh [i] don't know] [i] _it's it_ seems [to] me [that] _uh _the_ more_ [i think] [about] [it] [uh] ... 
A|43| A: [but] there's _a_ 
B|44| M: _well_ [i don't know] . 
A|45| A: mandatory _just_ _like_ _like_ [the] draft . [no .] 
B|46| M: [i i] agree _with_ [you] _there_ _. _i i_ think that_ [uh] [that that] [would] [be] _a good_ idea . 
A|47| A: every _time_ [you] _they_ could buy _their_ way [out] . 
B|48| M: [yeah] . 
A|49| A: [right] [you know] _they_ they'd figure [a] way around [that] one _in_ [a] heartbeat . [but] i'm wondering if there's another issue here [and] maybe _this_ _is_ why _this_ has died [out] . _can_ [you] _go_ into [and] _this_ wasn't [the] question [but] [it's it] may _be [the_ more] _of_ [the] issue versus should young adults _can_ _they_ _go_ _in_ [there] [and] _can_ anyone _go_ into [well] [out] _of_ [the] kurdish community _is_ [a] little bit extreme at _this_ _time_ [but] say [i think] bangladesh [would] _have_ been [a good] example or some some _really_ desperate situation [and] teach _them to_ farm [and] teach [them] [and] [it] doesn't _do_ any [good] . 
B|50| M: uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [i don't know] [that] [it] does [. i [i] don't know] [that] [um] if [you] step back from [the] current issue [and] look at [it] [more] intellectually _there are_ forever over [as] long [as] we [know] _there are_ races _of_ people [that] _are_ dropping [out] . 
B|52| M: uh-huh . 
A|53| A: [you know] we're losing certain races _of_ people . 
B|54| M: [right .] 
A|55| A: _there are_ people now [that] _are_ obsolete point [and] fact _just_ _just_ _like_ endangered species _of_ animals _so_ _there are_ quote tribes _of_ people [that] _are_ endangered or obsolete . 
B|56| M: [huh .] 
A|57| A: [and] i'm _just_ wondering if _you're_ fighting [a] natural process [there] _of_ being winnowed [out] . there's [a] german word [for it] [that's] elegant [but] [i] never _can_ remember what [it] was [uh] [but] [but] [that] _they're_ _they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ where _they_ _are_ _they're not_ adapted [to] _their_ environment essentially . 
B|58| M: [right .] 
A|59| A: [um] [and] one _of_ [the] quick examples _is_ [the] aborigines . 
B|60| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that .] 
A|61| A: [uh] when we were _in_ australia [uh] sad little _things_ . [uh i] felt sorry [for] [them] . _because_ _their_ society isn't [there] anymore [and] _their_ belief system [and] _all_ _their_ structured [of] theirs _all the_ structures [of] _their_ society _are_ gone essentially . 
B|62| M: [oh really] . 
A|63| A: _and they're_ _just_ kind [of] [more] _like_ [a] side show than anything else [and] [that's] sad . 
B|64| M: [well] [i] guess [i] haven't [really] [seen] [too] much [of] [it] lately . 
A|65| A: [but] [i don't] [think] there's any way [you] could _go_ [uh the] peace corps could _go_ _in_ [and] rescue those people _and [i_ don't] [think] [you] could _have_ done [it] fifty or [a] hundred years ago either . 
B|66| M: [no] [no .] 
A|67| A: _so_ [i] i'm wondering if [the] peace corps _is_ [really] _an_ effective tool . 
B|68| M: [i don't know] . 
A|69| A: [good] point . we've [got] _enough_ without without [a] passport there's plenty . 
B|70| M: uh-huh . 
A|71| A: yes [. [i] think] we ought [to] worry [about] our own species . 
B|72| M: [i think] [so] [too] [. i] [uh i _think] the the_ [other] _thing_ [that's] [interesting] [uh] . 
A|73| A: [i] wonder now _in_ [and] i've been [out] [of] school [too] long [to] answer _this_ [but] [i] wonder if [there] aren't some sociology courses . 
B|74| M: [well] _i i think_ [there are] [. i] [uh] [have a] son who's graduating [and] he's [not] even yet old [enough] [to] [to] even get involved . 
A|75| A: [that's] [the] last [thing] _you want to do_ . 
B|76| M: [and] [uh] [you] [think] [of] [all the] [things] [that] [you want to do] [you] [would] [like] [to do] [in] your spare [time] . 
A|77| A: [yeah] [that's] exactly [it .] 
B|78| M: [and _they're] not going to_ pay [for [it] [.] and [i think] it's] _going [to_ be] [a] [big] [problem] [for] [the] kids [because] [you're] encouraging [them to] rebel [you] [don't know] [you] [just] [you] can't [do] [this] [and] [you're] _going [to_ do] [this] [and] [you] [can] [not] [do] [that] [and [it's] _not] going_ [be [the] same] [for] [the] parents . 
A|79| A: [they're not going to] take [that] money [you] give [them] [and] _go_ try [to] figure [out] [a] way [to] dry [out] [with] [it .] now come on let's [be] realistic 
B|80| M: uh-huh . 
A|81| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|82| M: [well] [that [that] is] [that] [would] [be] [an] [interesting] concept . 
A|83| A: [right .] 
B|84| M: [and] then then [they] [can] [go] [out] [and] [do] [their] [thing] [and they] [can] make [themselves] wealthy . 
A|85| A: [no] we're [not] [i don't] [think] [. [i] think] [that's] [more] realistic than making [them] [go] [in] [the] peace corps . 
B|86| M: [yeah] . 
A|87| A: [i think] [that's] [a] lot [more] realistic . [uh [i] i think that] we should [be] spending [more] [time] [and] [and] again [i don't] [think the the] peace corps [is] [is] [as] successful now simply [because] [it's not] . [it] doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|88| M: [right . right .] 
A|89| A: [uh] we've [got] plenty [in] fact we've [got] [far] [too] many . [you're] [in] [uh] what flower mound ? 
B|90| M: uh-huh . 
A|91| A: [i] was [that's] exactly what [i] was [going to] ask [you] . [have] [you] ever [have] [have] [you] been downtown
