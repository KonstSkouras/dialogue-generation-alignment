B|53| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|54| A: [oh] yes _but we_ try [you _know] i_ try [my] husband also we're involved [in] _everything_ our _kids_ does 
B|55| M: uh-oh .

B|57| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [so] [i] _always_ [just] had [a] mother . [so] [i] _always_ [thought] _when_ [i] _have kids_ [you _know] i_ [really] _want to be_ involved _with them_ . 
B|59| M: _yeah i_ [i] think [that's] [the thing] _that really_ hit home [a] [little] bit _though_ [i mean] [i] _don't_ [have a] lot [of friends that] [that] _have children but_ [i] think i'm [always] hearing [a] lot about [the] [kids] [that] [have] _them and_ _how_ [they're] [doing] [so] [well] [you] _you don't_ hear [a] lot [you] hear [a] [little] [you] probably hear [a] whole lot about [them] from your [friends that] [have kids] . 
A|60| A: material things yes [that] is yes

A|66| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|67| M: [you know] _and you don't_ [you] don _you have to_ think about [that] _and _you_ can't_ [just] say [well] [you] need [to] exercise [you] got [to be] active you've got _to do_ [what] [you] [want _to] do_ [and i] [i] think [that's] important [you] _you're_ [not] [just] [going to] sit there [and] say _well i_ need _to do_ _this_ [but] [i] need some [time] _to do it ._ 
A|68| A: [yeah .] 
B|69| M: [but] [he's] _you can't_ _you don't_ [have] _you have to_ [have] all [that] [in] [in] your life . 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| M: [so] [it] [just] [kind of] makes [you] feel _good_ _you're_ [kind of] bonding [with _them] [and_ it] makes [you] [not] feel guilty [and] [it's] [something] [that] _you don't_ _have _to_ do_ [every] day . 
A|72| A: [oh] [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|73| M: [so] _you can_ [see] [that] [there's] [a] lot [of] changes [and i] think [i] think [that] [uh] . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| M: _you have [to_ be] [a] certain income holder [and] [that's] [it] _you have to_ [go] back [to] _work_ [and that] [that] _you have_ all these rights [that] you've beenogged [over] [and] [over] [and that] [just] doesn't _work_ 
A|76| A: [yeah] [you have to] 
B|77| M: [and] [uh] .

B|79| M: uh-uh . uh-hums uh-hum .

A|88| A: [uh-huh] [yeah i] agree [with] [you] very _much_ _so ._ now [we] waited several _years_ before [we] started having [children] [because] [we] [was] _still_ [in] _college_ [and] [we] knew [time] wise or [and] _money_ wise [too]

A|122| A: [oh .] 
B|123| M: [so] [you know] [there's] there [are] [places] [like] [you] said where [you can] [just] [go] ahead [and] pay cash _for_ [as] [much] [as] [you] [want] [but you] don taj [a] nickel . 
A|124| A: then you'll [never] _leave_ .
