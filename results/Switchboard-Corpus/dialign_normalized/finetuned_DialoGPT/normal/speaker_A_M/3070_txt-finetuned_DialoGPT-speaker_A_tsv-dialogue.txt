A|58| A: [you] [all] equated [the] [family] reunions as with [the] protestant . 
B|59| M: [right .] [right .] 
A|60| A: _it _was_ the_ protestant version [of the] catholic pilgrimage . 
B|61| M: [oh that's] _interesting_ . 
A|62| A: _it was_ _it was_ an [interesting] theory . she talked _about_ [the] [uh the] catholics [all] [it's a] home centered [you know] [it's] [all] [family] centered anyway [so you] [usually] [are] living where _your_ parents [live] [and it's] [all] _your_ [you] _don't _have_ to_ come home [so] [the] catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older europe [but] when [the] protestant ethic happened [in] america [there] _were_ _people_ who _ever_ went [out [and] you know] went away _from the_ [family] [to] seek their fortune [and then] _had to_ come back home _for_ their [reunion] [so] [that] became their version [of the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M: huh _. that's_ [interesting] . 
A|64| A: [but] she [had] _it was_ [interesting] [you _know] [i_ don't know] how valid _it is_ [but] she talked _about_ [that] [and] how [the] [the] [big] [picnic] table _was the_ symbolic communion [of the] _people_ gathering [together] [and] [um] [you know] _about_ [the] bread [and] [the] ritual placement . [do you] [have [a] a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed [out] [on] [the] table [every] [every year] ? [is] [there] _kind of a_ [you know] salads [go] [first] [and] things [like] [that] ? 
B|65| M: _yeah_ _yeah ._ 
A|66| A: [right .] 
B|67| M: [and uh] [we] we're [all] [from] [uh] [in the] [you] [i] guess [you're] [from the] dallas area 
A|68| A: _well that's_ pretty . 
B|69| M: [and uh] . 
A|70| A: sure does [. that's] _wonderful ._ 
B|71| M: [so i] think [it's [it's] a] [wonderful] _thing_ . 
A|72| A: [yeah _.] i_ wish _we'd_ 
B|73| M: [we'd] [have to] [have] some [kind of a] plan [that] [was] able [to] accommodate [everyone] . 
A|74| A: [right .] 
B|75| M: [so] he [had to] work until he [was] ready [to] [go] [and] _and so_ he [had [a] lot] [of] time [to] think [about] [what] he wanted [to] [do] . 
A|76| A: [right .] 
B|77| M:  !!!!!! % !! remind me .!!!!! [that's] [right] !! [you] !! [i] !! [it] !! [yeah] !!?!! did !! [okay] !! [well] !! hi !! _have you_ [ever] [had a] [uh] [a] real barbecue ? 
A|78| A: wow . [you're] [just] [uh] [oh that's] incredible . 
B|79| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] now . 
A|80| A: [right .] 
B|81| M: [but] [i] [was] able [to] [you] [you] [had to] [have] [have] [your] own [people] [you] weren't able [to] [just] walk around [and] shoot everybody _else_ . 
A|82| A: [right] 
B|83| M: [and then] _we had uh_ [uh] [a] [big] roast [that] _we had_ [for] breakfast . 
A|84| A: [have you] [have you] done [this] repetitively [or] [just] _once_ ? 
B|85| M: [yeah] [once] . 
A|86| A: [oh .] 
B|87| M: [and] [we] [were] [there] [for a] week [and] [i] [was] [there] [for] [about] [a] week [and] [a] half [and] [it was] [wonderful [.] i] mean [it] [it is] [a] beautiful country . 
A|88| A: see [that's] we've [we [had] _a] problem_ with [that] . 
B|89| M: [i don't [know] i] guess [i [don't] [have] [a] _problem] [._ i] [i] [just] think [that] [uh] [you know] . 
A|90| A: [oh .] 
B|91| M: [and] [they're] still [you] still can't [get] around . 
A|92| A: [right [.] that's] [our] [was] [our] [problem .] [we had [uh] [the] first] [reunion] [or] [the first] [you know] major [reunion] [was] probably six [or] seven years ago . 
B|93| M: uh-huh . 
A|94| A: [and then the] second [reunion] [people] who maybe [you know] [had] sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first one] thought [oh] [well it's not] [that] [big] [a] [thing] [this] [year] 
B|95| M: [uh] . 
A|96| A: [and so] [it] [kind of] wound down 
B|97| M: [well that's] [that] [was the] only bad experience [i] [ever] [had] . 
A|98| A: [and then] finally [you know] [you're] lucky [to] [get] [you know] [you] [get] [the] shreveport relatives [there] [but] no [one] [else] [so] [that] 
B|99| M: [right .]
