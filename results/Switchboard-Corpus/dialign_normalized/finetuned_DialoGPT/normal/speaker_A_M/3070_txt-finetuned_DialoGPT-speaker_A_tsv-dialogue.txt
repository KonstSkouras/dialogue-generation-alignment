B|37| M: _well , it's not_ [a] [town hall] _, it_ _, it_ [it's just] [a _,] it_ has [like] two rooms _, _and ,_ uh_ _the one_ room [is] [like a] _big_ _, it_ only has _one_ door _, _and then_ the_ other door [is] open _, so you_ can [just] _go_ _out_ _there_ _and , you know ,_ enjoy [the] quiet _of the_ room . 
A|38| A: _okay_ . 
B|39| M: _and it's_ _the first one_ [that] [we] [have] . 
A|40| A: potato salad [and , uh ,] 
B|41| M: [and] [you] [just] heat _them_ up _, you know _,_ and then_ _you ,_ 
A|42| A: _oh [, that's_ good .]

A|44| A: _right ._ 
B|45| M: [uh _,] and _,_ and_ [that's] [a] real _big_ _thing_ [in] _our_ [family] , too [, is] squash ,

A|48| A: _oh , that's_ nice . 
B|49| M: _yeah_ _, [and ,_ uh] . 
A|50| A: _right ._ 
B|51| M: _and _so_ that's_ why [we] [have] [, uh [,] a] variety . 
A|52| A: [do] [they] always [have] _the [,_ [the] one] person _in the_ [family] who knows , [or] _everyone_ thinks [they] [know] how [to] make [this] [the] best [, [so] that's] _what_ [they] [get] [to] cook . 
B|53| M: [right] , uh-huh . 
A|54| A: _well [, that's_ good .] [well [,] i] _had a_ professor [in] anthropology at school who studied [family] reunions [, so] [i] learned [a lot] _about_ [them] _. i_ haven't , been [to] [a lot] , 
B|55| M: [oh .] 
A|56| A: [but] [we] talked [, [a] lot] _about_ _the [,_ the] rituals , 
B|57| M: [right .] 
A|58| A: [you] [all] equated [the] [family] reunions as , with [the] protestant . 
B|59| M: [right .] [right .] 
A|60| A: _it _was_ the_ protestant version [of the] catholic pilgrimage . 
B|61| M: [oh , that's] _interesting_ . 
A|62| A: _it was_ [, _it] was_ an [interesting] theory . she talked _about_ _the [,_ uh , the] catholics [all] _, it's a_ home centered [, you know [,] it's] [all] [family] centered anyway [, so you] [usually] [are] living where _your_ parents [live] [and it's] [all] , _your_ [, you] _don't _have_ to_ come home [, so] [the] catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older europe , [but] when [the] protestant ethic happened [in] america , [there] _were_ _people_ who _ever_ went [out [and] , you know ,] went away _from the_ [family] [to] seek their fortune [, and then] _had to_ come back home _for_ their [reunion] [, so] [that ,] became their version [of the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M: huh _. that's_ [interesting] . 
A|64| A: [but] she [had [,] _it] was_ [interesting] [, you _know [,] i_ don't know] how valid _it is_ , [but] she talked _about_ [that] [and] how _the [,_ the] [big] [picnic] table _was the_ symbolic communion [of the] _people_ gathering [together] [, and ,] [um [,] you know ,] _about_ [the] bread [and] [the] ritual placement . [do you] [have [a] , a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed [out] [on] [the] table [every] , [every year] ? [is] [there] _kind of [a_ [,] you know ,] salads [go] [first] [and] things [like] [that] ? 
B|65| M: _yeah_ , _yeah ._ 
A|66| A: [right .] 
B|67| M: [and , uh] [we] , we're [all] [from] [, uh] [in [the] [,] _you] [,_ i] guess [you're] [from the] dallas area , 
A|68| A: _well , that's_ pretty . 
B|69| M: [and , uh] . 
A|70| A: sure does [. that's] _wonderful ._ 
B|71| M: [so] [, i] think [it's [, it's] a] [wonderful] _thing_ . 
A|72| A: [yeah _.] i_ wish _we'd_ , 
B|73| M: [we'd] [have to] [have] some [kind of a] plan [that] [was] able [to] accommodate [everyone] . 
A|74| A: [right .] 
B|75| M: [so] he [had to] work until he [was] ready [to] [go] [and [,] _and] so_ he [had [a] lot] [of] time [to] think [about] [what] he wanted [to] [do] . 
A|76| A: [right .] 
B|77| M:  !!!!!! % !! remind me .!!!,!! [that's] [right] !! [you] !! [i] !! [it] !! [yeah] !!?!! did !! [okay] !! [well] !! hi !! _have you_ [ever] [had [a] [,] uh [,] a] real barbecue ? 
A|78| A: wow . [you're] [just] [, uh ,] [oh , that's] incredible . 
B|79| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] now . 
A|80| A: [right .] 
B|81| M: [but] [i] [was] able [to] [, _you] [,_ you] [had to] [have] _, have_ [your] own [people] [, you] weren't able [to] [just] walk around [and] shoot everybody _else_ . 
A|82| A: [right] 
B|83| M: [and then] _we had , uh_ [uh [,] a] [big] roast [that] _we had_ [for] breakfast . 
A|84| A: [have [you] [,] [have] you] done [this] repetitively , [or] [just] _once_ ? 
B|85| M: [yeah] , [once] . 
A|86| A: [oh .] 
B|87| M: [and] [we] [were] [there] [for a] week [, and] [i] [was] [there] [for] [about] [a] week [and] [a] half [, and] [it was] [wonderful [.] i] mean [, it] [, [it] is] [a] beautiful country . 
A|88| A: see [, that's] we've [we [had] _a] problem_ with [that] . 
B|89| M: [i don't [know] , i] guess [, i [don't] [have] [a] _problem] [._ i] [, i] [just] think [that [,] uh] [you know] . 
A|90| A: [oh .] 
B|91| M: [and] [they're] still [, you] still can't [get] around . 
A|92| A: [right [.] that's] [our] , [was] [our] [problem .] [we had [, uh] , [the] first] [reunion] , [or] [the first] [, you know ,] major [reunion] [was] probably six [or] seven years ago . 
B|93| M: uh-huh . 
A|94| A: [and then the] second [reunion] , [people] who maybe [, you know ,] [had] sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first one] thought , [oh [,] [well , it's] not] [that] [big] [a] [thing] [this] [year] , 
B|95| M: [uh] . 
A|96| A: [and so] [it] [kind of] wound down , 
B|97| M: [well , that's] , [that] [was the] only bad experience [i] [ever] [had] . 
A|98| A: [and then] finally [, you know ,] [you're] lucky [to] [get] [, you know [,] you] [get] [the] shreveport relatives [there] , [but] no [one] [else] [so] [that ,] 
B|99| M: [right .]
