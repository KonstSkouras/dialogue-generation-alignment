B|0| M: and so _you_ _you_ can't really make judgments based on _that_ based on one person _you're_ not _you_ _have to_ make judgments on six people . 
A|1| A: _right ._ 
B|2| M: and then _the_ judge decides whether _or_ not it's _uh_ . 
A|3| A: _right ._ _they_ 
B|4| M: i mean i _think_ i mean it's _it_ _it_ is _a_ terrible problem . 
A|5| A: _right ._ 
B|6| M: so 
A|7| A: _well_ how _do_ [you] feel _about_ setting like _well_ _for_ _example_ [a] car type accident where [uh] [or] _some_ incident where someone loses [a] limb . _do_ [you] [think] _the jury_ _should _have_ a_ dollar figure _for_ losing an arm [a] dollar figure _for_ losing different body parts ? 
B|8| M: i [think] _it_ [should] be based on [the] number _of_ people _that_ were killed . 
A|9| A: uh-huh . 
B|10| M: i mean i [think] _that's_ [a] i donno i'm not _sure_ _that's_ _that's_ really [the] [right] way _to_ [do] _it_ . i i [uh] i [think] i would agree with [you] _that_ there [should] be [some] way _of_ checking [for] [uh] [uh] [you] [you] can't just say you've _you're_ [you] [have a] certain age _that_ _you're going to_ be drug tested and then [you] can say [well] i'm _sure_ [you] [have] drug use . 
A|11| A: huh . 
B|12| M: [you] know and i [think] i [think] _that_ _that's_ _that_ would be unfair _to [the_ jury] because _they have to_ decide whether [or] not [they] want _to_ hear [the] facts . 
A|13| A: uh-huh . 
B|14| M: _but_ i [think] i don't know i i'm not _sure_ _that_ it's _that_ important . i [think] [they] [should have] more say . 
A|15| A: _yeah ._ 
B|16| M: _but_ i don't [think] it's [a] [a] necessity . 
A|17| A: _right ._ 
B|18| M: so i don't i donno i i [think] i'm not i mean i just [think] it's not _going to_ be it's _going to_ _have to_ be unanimous . 
A|19| A: _yeah _._ that's_ true . 
B|20| M: _but_ [uh] . 
A|21| A: huh . 
B|22| M: _but_ it's not [you] can't [do] _that_ . 
A|23| A: oh _out of_ as opposed [to _the] insurance_ _paying_ [the] bills 
B|24| M: [yeah .] [right .] 
A|25| A: uh-huh . [well] _we're_ who who 
B|26| M: [we're] [we're] _in_ [the] process [of] [of] building [a] [a] system . 
A|27| A: [do] [they] get [they] get insured [they] get insured from other _insurance companies_ [or] how does [that] _work_ ? 
B|28| M: [uh] [they] they're [they] go through [the] process [of] selection . 
A|29| A: oh okay your _talking about_ 
B|30| M: i'm [talking about] [the] [the [insurance] companies] [the] ones [that] are [that] are [paying] [out] huge amounts [of] money [to] these people . 
A|31| A: [sure] . 
B|32| M: and [they] and _they have to_ pay [for] _it_ themselves . 
A|33| A: okay . [well] 
B|34| M: so [uh] [that's] [the] first thing [they] look [for] is _if_ _you're going to_ [do] _it_ [that] way . 
A|35| A: [but] [in] [some] instances [you're going to] put [companies] _out of_ business by taking [that] stance [if] [they have to] take [it] _out of_ their own retained earnings . 
B|36| M: [right .] 
A|37| A: [that] [for] oh uh-huh . 
B|38| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind me [of] [that] [. that's] [a] very good [example] . 
A|39| A: uh-huh . 
B|40| M: so i mean [they have] no way [of] knowing [if] [the] person is guilty [or] innocent . 
A|41| A: [right .] _that will_ 
B|42| M: and [that will] make [it] even more difficult [for] them . 
A|43| A: huh . 
B|44| M: and [uh] i i [think] it's it's [going to] be [a] big problem . [uh] [the] way our tax laws are structured and [uh] [you] can't just tax people [out of] [the] [work] place [uh] . 
A|45| A: [sure] . okay .
