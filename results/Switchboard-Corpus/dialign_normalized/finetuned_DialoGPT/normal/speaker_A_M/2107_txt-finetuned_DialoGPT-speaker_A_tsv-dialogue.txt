B|52| M: [yeah .] 
A|53| A: no . 
B|54| M: _we have_ [two _cats] . _and_ , uh_

B|56| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|57| A: [and] [it] worries [me] [that] _one_ day _one_ [of] _them_ won't come back , 
B|58| M: [yeah , [i] know ,] 
A|59| A: [and i] feel [like] [they] need [a] big home [, a] nice place where someone _can_ [have] [the] time [to] play _with_ _them_ [and] _things ._ _but _i_ can't_ give _them_ [up] . 
B|60| M: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: [i [just] [,] i] [go] hysterical [when] [they] [don't] come home .

B|64| M: [yeah .] 
A|65| A: [and] [you] [go] [crazy] thinking [it] might _be_ yours . 
B|66| M: [that's] _right ._ 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: _he was_ [just] [like , you _know [,] i_ can't] [do] [this] [, i] [want] [to do] [this] .

A|73| A: [it's] here now _, we _have_ to_ keep [it .] [yeah [,] my] [, my] first _one_ [that] [i] got [, i] [had] [just] moved away from home [and] got [my] own apartment . [it] took [me] [about] [two] [weeks] [to] realize _, that_ [was] real lonely . 
B|74| M: [yeah .] 
A|75| A: [so] [i] found [this] _one_ [and [, uh] ,] actually [it was] [on] [a] sign [at] taco bell drive-thru [that] [said] free kittens . 
B|76| M: [oh , [i] know] . 
A|77| A: [and i] thought [well] [that's] interesting , i'll call _them ._ 
B|78| M: [yeah _,] that's_ [, that] [, _that] would be_ _good_ . 
A|79| A: [and [he] was] [the] only _one_ left [and] his mother [had] _been_ killed coming back across [the] road [to] make sure she'd gotten [all] _her_ kittens . 
B|80| M: uh-hauh . 
A|81| A: [and [he] was] [the] last _one_ _she_ carried across _, you know , the_ whole big _sad_ story . 
B|82| M: [yeah .]

B|84| M: [yeah .] 
A|85| A: [and _he] is_ [, uh _,] you can tell_ [he was] weaned _too_ young because he'll nurse [on] your ears [and] your fingers . 
B|86| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: [yeah [,] [he] [,] i] asked [the] vet why [he] did [that] [and he] [said] [he was] probably weaned _too_ young , which [he was] , because his mom [was] killed [, so .] 
B|88| M: _well _,_ that's_ [sad] . 
A|89| A: [but] _he is_ [the] lovingest _cat_ . everybody , [people] who [don't] even [like] _cats ,_ [like] him . 
B|90| M: [he is] . 
A|91| A: [he] _never_ meows [, [he] , he] _doesn't_ [have] [any] front claws [, i] [had] him declawed , 
B|92| M: [oh ,] [really] ? 
A|93| A: [but] [he] _doesn't_ bite anybody [he's] [just ,] [he's] [just] kind [of] [there] , real friendly [and] docile .
