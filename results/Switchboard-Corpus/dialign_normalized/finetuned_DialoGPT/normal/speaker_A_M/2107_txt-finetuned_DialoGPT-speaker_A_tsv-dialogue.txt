B|86| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: [yeah] [he] [i] asked [the] vet why [he] did [that] [and he] [said] [he was] probably weaned _too_ young which [he was] because his mom [was] killed [so .] 
B|88| M: [well that's] [sad] . 
A|89| A: [but] _he is_ [the] lovingest _cat_ . everybody [people] who [don't] even [like] [cats] [like] him .
