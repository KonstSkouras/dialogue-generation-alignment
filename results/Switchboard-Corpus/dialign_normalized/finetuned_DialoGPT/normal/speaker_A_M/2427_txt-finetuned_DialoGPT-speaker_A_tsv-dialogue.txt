A|103| A: [uh] [not] [a] whole lot [uh [.] i [i] don't] use [i i] seldom use _anything_ harsher [than] seven dust _you know ._

A|115| A: [uh-huh .] _that's right ._ 
B|116| M: [and i] went [and i] took [it] back [and i] [put] [it] back [in the] middle [of the] [garden] [and] [it was] dead . 
A|117| A: absolutely . [they] [really] [go] through [it]
