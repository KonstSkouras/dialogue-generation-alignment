[i don't] know] [i] donno [i [i] think] [i'd] [have [to] take] [the] advice [you know] _from_ [a] [a] _an_ english major [to] [a] [to] [a] university [and see] [how] [they] treat [them] _you're_ [you] [don't] [have to] _have a_ [you] [have to] _be_ _an_ expert [to] _get_ [in] [on] subjects [like that] [and you] [have] _you've got to_ _be_ [a] [good] student [to] _get_ _an_ idea [of] [what] [a] subject [is] . 
A|77| A: [yeah yeah .] 
B|78| M: [okay .] 
A|79| A: [just] because there's [a] friend up there [not] because there's [much] else 
B|80| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: _for_ colleges ? 
B|82| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|83| A: [well] they're [not]

B|86| M: [oh] [okay .] 
A|87| A: [what] [what] [do] [you] [do] ? 
B|88| M: [i'm] [a] nurse . 
A|89| A: are [you] [going to] go [to] east [texas] _for_ [that] ? 
B|90| M: [yeah .] 
A|91| A: that'd probably [be] [pretty] [interesting] [. [i] was] summonsed down [to the] courthouse last week . [they] had summonsed eight hundred people [about] four hundred showed up [and] [it was] _for_ [a] murder trial . 
B|92| M: [oh] really ? 
A|93| A: this guy had supposedly [uh] strangled this woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling down her throat [and] up her nose anyway this [is] happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|94| M: [huh] . 
A|95| A: [and] [they] had us fill out [a] long questionnaire . [we] stayed till [about] [one] thirty [and] they're [going _to] call_ [the] ones [that] they're interested [in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three at [a] time [and] [the] trial won't [take] place until june . 
B|96| M: uh-hauhuh [uh] . 
A|97| A: [and] [they] say [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . [and] this guy [in] front [of] [me] said [i] [can't] _believe_ [i was] summonsed [. [i] was] [an] investigator [and [i] was] tailing [the] woman [that was] killed . [well] [then] [i have a] friend at [school] [that] has [a] boyfriend [that's] [a] lawyer [and] [he] said [that] this woman this socialite [in plano] had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the one] [that's] accused [was] [the one] [that] actually did [it] . [and she] has since taken off [with] another lawyer [who] had been [uh] getting cocaine [from] his client [and then] selling [it and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited him [and] [he's] [going to] testify _for_ [the] state against her [so] he'll [have] his sentence reduced . 
B|98| M: [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|99| A: [yeah .] 
B|100| M: [okay] [i [i] [was] just] [sitting here] waiting [for] _somebody_ [to call] [me .] 
A|101| A: [the the] investigator [. yeah] [he] [he] [got] off [right] away . 
B|102| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of that] _oh gosh_ !! 
A|103| A: [and i] wrote [that] down [on] [my] questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that] 
B|104| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [so i] figure [that] [that] will make [me] biased [and i] won't [be] chosen . 
B|106| M: [right] . 
A|107| A: hopefully 
B|108| M: [but] [uh] [i] [do] [feel] [like that] [uh] ... 
A|109| A: [yeah .] no . *aa 
B|110| M: [but] [uh] 
A|111| A: [i] said [that] [i] could _believe_ [in] [it] [in] certain instances [but i] _would_ [be] [i'd] find [it] hard [to] levy [that] against [somebody] . 
B|112| M: [well] [i [i] don't know] [uh] [i] [uh] [. [i] think] [uh] [you know] [in the] [in the] cases [like] [uh] [uh] [in] [uh] england [and] france [where] [they] [have] [the] death penalty [and you] [have to] register as [a] as [a] social [uh] citizen 
A|113| A: _you know ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: [they] [would] [they] [would] [not] [believe] [that] [you know .] 
A|115| A: [yeah .] [but] [then] [when] [you're] [when] [you're] picked [see] [i was] picked [for] another murder trial before 
B|116| M: uh-hoh . 
A|117| A: [oh gosh] [and it's] [so] hard because [you know] everybody [is] wanting [to] go [on] [and] [get] [the] sentence done [and] if [you're] trying [to] hold out [you know] there's [so] [much] pressure [on] [you] [and] [you've got to] come up [with] [a] decision . 
B|118| M: [uh] [yeah .]
