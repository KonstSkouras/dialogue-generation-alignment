A|17| A: [yeah i i] _was_ called once but [i] _was_ out of _the_ country [and] apparently [i] apparently [they] thought [i] served [so] [i] didn't [i] didn't make any noise about _it_ [i] came back [and] [they] said _the_ record showed [i] served but [i] _was_ out of _the_ country at _the_ time [so] _i'm_ _pretty_ _sure_ [i] didn't [. uh] 
B|18| M: _well i'm_ [sure] [you] [were] . 
A|19| A: [yeah] [well [i] [i] i] _don't_ _know i_ definitely feel like we need [to] keep _it_ at least unanimous because [uh] _you know_ there's _the_ classic sort of [to] kill [a] mockingbird kind of story where [you] get _you know_ 
B|20| M: _oh_ _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: _and uh_ _it_ seems [to] me [that] if [you] could just _have a_ simple majority [or] something [you] could _pretty much_ _you know_ browbeat _the jury_ [a] majority in _the_ of _the_ [a] majority of _the jury_ 
B|22| M: _right ._ 
A|23| A: _that's_ hard [to] say [. uh] [so] [it's] [it's] [uh] _you know_ saying [well] look we _don't_ like _the_ way he looks [and] let's [uh] let's throw _the_ rascal in jail [and] stuff . 
B|24| M: _yeah ._ 
A|25| A: [and] [you] also get [a] lot of [uh] juries _are_ extremely [uh] [and] from what [i] hear [i i] _have_ [i] _have_ some friends who [do] expert witness testimony [and] [they] say [that] [uh] juries _are_ extremely vulnerable [to] [uh] sort of emotional pitches _you know_ _the_ prosecutor will want [to] [oh] [i] _don't_ _know_ show _the_ show _the_ mugging victim _you know_ show what _the_ _nice_ person he _was_ [and] what [a] family life [and] basically get _the jury_ [to] _be_ very sympathetic [with] _the_ victim _and uh_ [or] [or] [uh] if [it's] [a] corporation [that] _was_ [uh] _you know_ harming some individual [or] something like [that they] get very _much_ _well _you_ know_ [it's] just [a] big faceless corporation . let's let's make them pay as _much_ as possible . things like [that .] 
B|26| M: [uh i] _think_ uh-havings [i mean] jeez jeezer jokes [are] [are] [pretty much] automatic penalties . 
A|27| A: [so] [not] [i [i] mean] [i'm] _the_ problem is [i] _can't_ guarantee [that] [a] judge _would_ _be_ necessarily _be_ [much] better than [a] _jury_ but i'd _be_ real nervous having [a] _jury_ [not] at least fully [agree] [on] what _the_ settlements _would_ _be_ things like [that .] 
B|28| M: [well you] [can't] [you] [you] [don't] [have a] perfect [system .] 
A|29| A: [yeah .] 
B|30| M: [you [know] i] _think_ [the jury] should [be] able [to] recommend sentencing . 
A|31| A: uh-huh . [well] how about having [a] [jury] [and] [a] judge work together [on] _it_ somehow ? [i] wonder if _that's_ possible ? [i] guess [the] judge's time is worth _too_ [much] though . 
B|32| M: [well [i] would] _think_ [so] . 
A|33| A: [they] pay [that] judge [they] pay those [jury] members very [little] money compared [to] [that] judge 
B|34| M: [uh] 
A|35| A: he makes [more] money in an hour than all twelve of them put together . 
B|36| M: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|37| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [and uh] . 
A|39| A: [oh] of course . [it's] [it's] political maneuvering . [the] [the] one side is looking for someone whose face [they] [think] will [you know] want [to] hang everyone [and] [the] other one is [going to] look for someone very sympathetic . they're [not] looking for someone who's [going to] [be] [the] most reasoned [or] sensible [or] rational juror . *whose who's neither side wants [that .] [they] want [to] find [a] juror [that's] [going to] [uh] [be] most persuadable by their arguments [you know] . 
B|40| M: _right ._ 
A|41| A: [uh i] wish _it_ [were] [a little] bit harder [to] [not] serve [on] juries actually . [i mean] [i] [know] _it_ _it_ [it's] tricky because [i] [know] [you know] an awful lot of intelligent people who just [well i'm] _too_ busy [to] serve [on] [a] [jury] 
B|42| M: uh-uh _. [yeah_ .] 
A|43| A: [so] i'll tell them [that] [and] [they] won't [or] just [you know] just answer one of [the] questions [the] wrong way because [you] can [do] [that] [you know] 
B|44| M: [yeah .] 
A|45| A: [they] just say [do] [you] believe in such [and] such [. uh] 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [right .] course they'd [be] [they] [would] [be] barred but 
B|48| M: [right] [right .] 
A|49| A: uh-huh [. yeah] [well] _it_ sounds like we both need [to] get out there [and] serve [on] [a] [jury] . 
B|50| M: [i] [think] [so] [too] . 
A|51| A: [i] hope we're called up [before] [too] long . 
B|52| M: _okay well_ we'll talk [to] [you] later . 
A|53| A: [they] will [they] will eventually . [okay well] _it was nice_ talking [with you] . 
B|54| M: [it was nice] [to] talk [to] [you] [too] .
