A|21| A: [and] [i think [it's] really] very sad [that] north _of_ [the] border [you know] [the] united states [and] canada [is] so different from [the] from south [america] [and] central [america .] 
B|22| M: oh _yeah_ . 
A|23| A: _there's_ [really] [a] disparity between [the] [uh] what [a] [i] would call civilization _of_ [the] countries [you know] . 
B|24| M: _yeah_ [that's] true . 
A|25| A: _uh-huh ._

A|27| A: yes [it's really] kind [of] sad [and] [that] [we] would go all [the] way [to] iraq [and] [that] [we] would [be] very concerned [with] [the] situation between jerusalem [and uh] israel [and the] middle east arab countries [and and] when [we] have when [we] have [a lot of] problems [right] [in] our own back door . 
B|28| M: [uh] _yeah_ . 
A|29| A: um . 
B|30| M: [and uh] . 
A|31| A: so _i guess_ we've kind [of] neglected [latin america .] 
B|32| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|33| A: recently 
B|34| M: [right .] 
A|35| A: [yeah] fairly recently . _well_ [that's] [really] sad [. i] hadn't thought about [that] [in] [a] long time . 
B|36| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: _well _i_ guess_ then [i] will go [but i]

A|39| A: made me stop [and] [think] [a] minute about [not] worrying so much about [the] middle east crisis . 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [i] [know] [that] [it's not] settled [but] [there] [are] other areas [that] [we] could focus our attention on . 
B|42| M: [right .] 
A|43| A: [well] thank [you] [you] have [a] [good] day .
