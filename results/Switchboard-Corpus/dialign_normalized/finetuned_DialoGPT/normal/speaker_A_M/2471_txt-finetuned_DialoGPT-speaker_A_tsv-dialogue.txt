A|21| A: [and] [i think [it's] really] very sad [that] north _of_ [the] border , [you know [,] the] united states [and] canada [is] so different , from [the] from south _america [,_ and] central [america .] 
B|22| M: oh , _yeah_ .

B|24| M: _yeah [,_ that's] true .

B|28| M: [uh ,] _yeah_ . 
A|29| A: um . 
B|30| M: [and , uh] . 
A|31| A: so _i guess_ we've kind [of] neglected [latin america .] 
B|32| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|33| A: recently 
B|34| M: [right .] 
A|35| A: [yeah ,] fairly recently . _well_ [, that's] [really] sad [. i] hadn't thought about [that] [in] [a] long time . 
B|36| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: _well_ _, i guess_ then [, i] will go [, but [i] ,] 
B|38| M: [well] [i [,] i] [don't] [know [,] it's] [just] [, [i] ,] [it] seems [like] i'm getting older [and , and] i'm [not] sure if i'm going [to [,] to] stay [as] old [as] [i] want [to] [be] . 
A|39| A: made me stop [and] [think] [a] minute about , [not] worrying so much about [the] middle east crisis . 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [i] [know] [that] [it's not] settled [but ,] [there] [are] other areas [that] [we] could focus our attention on . 
B|42| M: [right .] 
A|43| A: [well] , thank [you] , [you] have [a] [good] day .
