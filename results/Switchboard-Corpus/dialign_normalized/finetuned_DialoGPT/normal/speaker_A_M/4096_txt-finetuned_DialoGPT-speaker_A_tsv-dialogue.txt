B|0| M: _uh_ . 
A|1| A: _and uh_ they had basically decided _that_ there _is_ going to be _a_ real _problem_ here within _a_ _few years_ on solid waste . 
B|2| M: [uh] _yeah ._ 
A|3| A: well _it's_ not too new . 
B|4| M: _yeah ._ 
A|5| A: oh they _really_ didn't propose any solutions . actually they were _the_ guy _was_ pretty negative _about_ _the_ things _that_ _the_ government _was_ doing _even_ though _he was_ from _the_ e p _a_ . 
B|6| M: _yeah ._ 
A|7| A: _but_ _he_ had _a_ lot _of_ [uh] facts to to give _and uh_ things like _how_ many solid waste plants were being shut down _and_ _and uh_ one _of_ _the_ most interesting things _that_ _he was_ talking _about_ _was_ _recycling_ _of_ _of_ news print _. he was_ talking _about_ [uh] _the_ city _of_ new york _and_ _how_ they went _and_ collected all this news print 
B|8| M: [uh] . 
A|9| A: _and_ they could sell _it_ for _a_ while . they were able to sell _it_ for some amount per ton _and_ now at this stage _of_ _the_ game where they _have_ gotten into _recycling_ they've collected _so_ much news print _that_ they _have_ to pay to _have_ _it_ hauled away . 
B|10| M: _yeah_ _i_ _i_ don't know _if _you_ have_ [a] local _paper_ [but] _i_ [uh] 
A|11| A: [yeah .] we're doing some here _in_ _in_ cash valley _the_ community here . 
B|12| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|13| A: there's [uh] we've actually got [a] _kind of_ [a] nice set up . we've got [a] couple _of_ plants here _that_ actually take [uh] recycled [paper] _and_ shred _it_ _and_ spray _it_ with chemical treatment _so_ _that_ _it's_ not [a] fire hazard _and_ make _it_ into insulation 
B|14| M: [uh] [how] _do_ _you_ handle [that] ? 
A|15| A: _and_ they _can_ actually use as much recycled [paper] as _the_ community _can_ get to them . because they are actually buying _it_ _and_ shipping _it_ _in_ from outside . 
B|16| M: right right . 
A|17| A: _so_ one _of_ _the_ real keys _it_ sounds like to getting _recycling_ for [uh] [paper] or something like [that] to go _is_ to get some sort _of_ business to actually want _it_ once [you have] collected _it_ . 
B|18| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|19| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|20| M: [and uh] . 
A|21| A: [and] there _was_ [a] [paper] presented at this conference from [a] guy from alabama [and] _he was_ _kind of_ hired to [do] [a] study by two departments for _the_ government . one _was_ like environmental protection [and] _the_ other one _was_ oh [i] can't remember _what_ [but] _the_ basic idea _it was_ presented to him _was_ [how] _can we_ maximize _the_ amount _of_ energy [that] _we_ _can_ get back from _recycling_ [and] minimize _the_ volume _of_ stuff [that] _we_ are putting into our landfill 
B|22| M: [uh] 
A|23| A: [and uh] _the_ solution [that] _he_ came up with for plastics [and] _it was_ _really_ quite amazing _he_ says well _the_ best _thing_ to [do] with plastics _is_ to burn them . 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! ; !! line !! line !! [you] bet !! that's [the] [kind of] [thing] that's [that] [i] think that's [really] been [a] major [problem] [in] [the] last [few years] [is] [that] [uh] ... 
A|25| A: _he_ came to [the] conclusion plastics [is] actually one [of] [the] biggest problems [in] landfills cause _it's_ _it's_ low weight [but] _it's_ high volume _so_ _it_ takes up [a] lot [of] space 
B|26| M: [uh] . 
A|27| A: [and] there's almost no energy there's very little energy value [in] actually doing [a] lot [of] [the] _recycling_ [but] there [is] [a] lot [of] energy [in] _it_ [if you] _can_ burn _it_ [and] use _it_ produce electricity . 
B|28| M: right [yeah .] 
A|29| A: _so_ his solution _was_ to burn plastic . collect _it_ [and] burn _it_ . 
B|30| M:  !!! % !! translated [it's] 
A|31| A: [yeah .] [and] [it's] _more than_ _even_ [paper] or something like [that] . there [is] _more_ energy [in] _it_ per pound or whatever . well [that] _was_ _he_ didn't deal with [that] . 
B|32| M: [yeah] [i] think [it's] [it was] [more than] _just_ [paper] [. he was] [even] [he was] [even] [recycling] [the] [the] tin cans . 
A|33| A: [he] [just] said burn [it] . 
B|34| M: okay . 
A|35| A: [he] didn't _talk about_ cleaning [it] up or anything like [that] . _so_ [it's] not very practical 
B|36| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [yeah] well real interesting . 
B|38| M: [so] [uh] [what] else [can we] [talk about] . 
A|39| A: [uh] not too much . [uh] [i] got [a] bit . actually
