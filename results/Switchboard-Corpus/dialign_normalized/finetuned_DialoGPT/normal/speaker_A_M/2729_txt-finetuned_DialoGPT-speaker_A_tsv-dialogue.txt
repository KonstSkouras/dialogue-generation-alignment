[he] loved [it .] 
B|85| M: [oh .] 
A|86| A: cocoa didn't [think] too much [of] [it] though . _she_ jumped [in] [and] then started screaming [and] made [me] pull _her_ back _out_ [. i] pulled _her out_ [and uh] then [had] [to] wrap _her_ up [in] [a] sweatshirt _because_ _she_ [was] shivering [so] bad
