B|46| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: _and so_ _um_ [i] try _to_ say [well] why _don't_ [you] _go_ fly kites or why _don't_ _you do_ something . 
B|48| M: [oh] [that] [is] [that] [would] [be] [good] 
A|49| A: [and] if _i have_ something _in_ mind _then_ he he remembers [that] [that's] _what_ he wants _to_ _do_ . 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|52| M: [you know] [and] [i think] [that's] [important] _because _you_ can_ tell [when] they're [when] [they] [get] older _you can_ _see_ how _much_ they've lost . 
A|53| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and they] _had_ [a] nice big roast [it was like] roast beef [you] could feed [it] [for] [two] adults [and then] roast [the] potatoes [and then you] _had_ [uh] _like a_ big roast beef sack full [of] fresh berries [and then] put [on] aitas [and] onions [and then] [a] little bit [of] amaretta [and] [some] crayon wine [and then] [just] cover [it] [with] foil [and] put _it in the_ microwave [for] [just] [a] minute [to] cool [it] up .

A|57| A: [yes] . 
B|58| M: [so] [we] left [and then we] [came] _back_ _and [it_ was] dark [and we] were gone [so] _long_ . 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [but] [we] [didn't] [know] [that] . 
A|61| A: [well] [that's right .] _but i_ _do_ [think] _um_ [you know] [like] [the] current trends are [that] _um_ [the] family unit [is] devaluated . _it's_ _not_ nearly _as_ [important] . 
B|62| M: [uh] [i think] [that's] probably _true ._ 
A|63| A: [we] _find_ [that] [you know] [back] [just] even fifty years ago [when] _people_ [had] financial problems [the] first _place_ [they] went [to] [was] their family . 
B|64| M: uh-uh . uh-uh uh-uh 
A|65| A: [and] families took _care_ [of] themselves [and] _um_ [but] now [you know] _people_ _don't_ [they] _don't_ support each other [that] way . 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [and] [uh] _it it_ [just] [you] [you] [don't] [have] [that] anymore _. you_ [have] [to] work [for] [it] . 
A|69| A: [that's right] [and] 
B|70| M: [and so] [it's] [it] really [is] [a] waste [of] someone's [time .] 
A|71| A: [right right] 
B|72| M: [and they] don tinker [with] [that and] [you know] [they] don [they] aren't [you] [don't] _see_ [the] mistakes [in] every work [place] 
A|73| A: [and] [it's] _not_ an easy sacrifice [for] [a] _person_ _to make_ [because _you] know i_ _you know i have_ interests [that] _too_ 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and _it] is_ hard _to make_ [uh] those interests _not_ [be] _as_ [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|76| M: [right .] 
A|77| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: [but uh] . 
A|79| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|80| M: [and] i'm [like] i'm [not] [that] old [but i] [just] [i] [just] can't seem [to] stick [with] [it] . 
A|81| A: [right .] 
B|82| M: [and so] [it was] [a] little different . 
A|83| A: _it is_ temporary . [it in the] middle [of] [it it] seems [like a] [long] [time] 
B|84| M: uh-uh _. [yeah_ .] 
A|85| A: [but] _you're right_ _it is_ temporary . _well i_ [see] [that] [we] both share [the] same belief here [that] [it's] [important] [that] [we] spend [time] [with] our kids 
B|86| M: [uh] _that's true ._ 
A|87| A: [and] [and] [in] spite [of]

A|89| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|90| M: [and] [uh] i'm sure [you're] [not] alone there . 
A|91| A: [yes] . 
B|92| M: [so [i] [i] think] [you] [see] [you] [don't] [see] [too] many single mothers having children _. you_ [see] more single mothers [um] having children [you do] [see] more [um] 
A|93| A: [that's true .] 
B|94| M: [you know i] mean [i] _i've_ [had] [people] [uh] let's [see] [i] [had] [a] friend who [was] [a] teacher [and] she [said] [that] [uh] ... 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [so] [it] really [is] [you're [right] .] 
A|97| A: [yeah .] 
B|98| M: [and] she [just] she [just] really doesn't [care] [about] [the] child either . she's [just] [you] [you] [just] [have] [to] accept [that] [as] [it is] . 
A|99| A: [well] [it is] [the] hardest thing [i've] ever done [as] [much] [as] you'd _go out_ 
B|100| M: uh-uh . uh-uh uh-uh 
A|101| A: [and] 
B|102| M: [i] [just] [i] [was] [just] thinking [i] [just] [you know i have] [to] [you] [just] [have] [to] [find] [a] [place] [you] [have] [to make] [it] [you] [don't] [have] [to go [out] and] buy [it] 
A|103| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|105| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|107| A: [well] [that's] [good] . 
B|108| M: [and] [uh [it's] just] [you know] she's such [a] wonderful [person] [and] [i i] [just] [i] really i'm [just] pulling [for] her . 
A|109| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|110| M: [so] [that's] really [uh] . 
A|111| A: no [. yeah] [i think] [so] . [i think] [it's] an investment [in] your future even if [it's] purely [not] [not] religious [. [you] can] at least say [that] [it's] [important] [to] our country [that] our family unit stays strong . 
B|112| M: [uh] [well i] [know] [my] wife's mother [in] law [is] [a] [a] [uh] [a] practicing vegetarian .
