A|93| A: [but] [i'm] [but] they've got [all] these caution signs now [on] fish 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [and] [so [i] kind of] stay 
B|96| M:  !!! % !! remind me .

B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: [and] especially [uh in] wisconsin [and] michigan [they] say [no] buying [of] our fish . 
B|100| M: [yeah .] 
A|101| A: [i] [well] [yeah .] [so i] am [and] _the the_ best brand [of] [chicken] [to] buy [is] [the uh] pilgrim pride [because] [they] [don't] use [all] these hormones [to] remote [uh] unnatural growth [in] their products . 
B|102| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|103| A: [so [i] mean] [we have _to] be_ [on] [the] lookout if [we] _want_ [to] stay healthy .
