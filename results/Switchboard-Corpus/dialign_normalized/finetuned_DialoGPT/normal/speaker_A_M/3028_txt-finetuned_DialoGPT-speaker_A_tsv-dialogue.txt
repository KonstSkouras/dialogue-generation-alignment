B|90| M: [really ?] 
A|91| A: [i know] [they] say [that , that] [is] , 
B|92| M: _you know , _i_ mean [,_ it's] [, [it] [,] it] [really] [is] [good] [for] [you] [to] [eat] [it] . 
A|93| A: [but] [i'm [,] but] they've got [all] these caution signs now [on] fish 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [and] [so] [i kind of] stay 
B|96| M:  !!! % !! remind me . 
A|97| A: [because] [of] [all] [the] pollution [in the] lakes [and] [the ,] everywhere [. [i] mean] there [isn't] any safe haven anymore [for] fish . 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: [and] especially [, uh ,] [in] wisconsin [and] michigan [they] say , [no ,] buying [of] our fish . 
B|100| M: [yeah .] 
A|101| A: [i [,] well [,] yeah .] [so] [i] am [, and] _the , the_ best brand [of] [chicken] [to] buy [is] [the [, uh] ,] pilgrim pride [because] [they] [don't] use [all] these hormones [to] remote [, uh ,] unnatural growth [in] their products . 
B|102| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|103| A: [so] [i mean [,] [we] have _to] be_ [on] [the] lookout if [we] _want_ [to] stay healthy . 
B|104| M: _right ._ 
A|105| A: [so] [i'm [,] i [,] [you know [,] i] ,]
