A|41| A: [yeah .] 
B|42| M: [it's] _like_ [, uh _,] you_ _see_ [the] same thing _happen_ _with_ [the] kids , you're _like_ _, well , you_ got _to do_ [something] [to] [get] _them_ _to do_ . 
A|43| A: _right_ [, _it's] a_ little [more] understandable under [the] circumstances [, i guess] .

A|45| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|46| M: _and i_ don [, i] don's _that [,_ that's] _, that _would_ be_ _fair_ _, _but_ [i_ think] _the _,_ the_ problem [is] _that ,_ [um] _, you know _,_ the [,_ uh] _the [,_ _i] [,_ i] [really] [don't] _see_ [the] problem _with_ _it [._ _i] [,_ uh] 
A|47| A: _uh-huh ._

A|49| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|50| M: _and , _and_ _,_ you know [,_ that's] [a] _big_ problem [. i] [don't] _know [,_ [i] think] [there's] [so] _much_ wrong _with_ [the] system , [um] _, you_ _, you_ [have] [people] who [are] , who [are] abusing [the] systems [and] who [are] committing crimes _that _,_ you_ can't _, you_ [don't] want _them_ _out_ [of] society _for_ _any_ length [of] time . 
A|51| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|52| M: _and [,_ uh ,] [so] _, you know [,_ [i] think] [that's] , _i'm not sure_ [that's] _right ._ 
A|53| A: [right] _, _we_ have_ enough , enough problems [with] overcrowding [in] [the] jails _as_ [it is .] [so] let , let [their] [country] [take] _care_ [of it .] 
B|54| M: [yeah _,] well [,_ we] , we're _not_ doing _that ._ we're [, we] [are] trying _to [,_ uh [,] uh [,] i] [don't] _know ,_ [to] make _it [,_ uh] 
A|55| A: [we] _don't have_ [, i guess] [too much] trouble [in] dallas [with] [, well [, i] guess [,] i guess] [we] [do] _have _a_ lot of people_ come [in] [from] mexico [, that] cause problems [, [but] , uh .] 
B|56| M: uh-uh . [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [yeah .] _uh-huh ._ 
B|58| M: _and ,_ uh-hue [, [i] think] [that's] probably [the] most common example _, and [i_ think] [, uh] _that's the_ most prevalent problem . 
A|59| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|60| M: _and i_ don , _i'm not sure_ [that] [they're] [as] , [as] close [as] [we] might [have] [with] [the] domestic political situation . 
A|61| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|62| M: [and] [they're] still raping [people] [and] killing [people] _and _,_ you_ can't even imagine _that ._ 
A|63| A: _uh-huh ._ [it] was amazing [i] went [to] [the] far east [, uh ,] _back_ [in] october [to do] some training [for] t [i] [and [i] ,] 
B|64| M: [uh ,] 
A|65| A: [uh ,] some [of] those countries [were] [so] safe [, it] was unreal . singapore [is] very , supposed [to] [be] very safe [and ,] [in] fact , tokyo [, and i] thought tokyo [would be] dangerous [being] such [a] huge large city [with] [so] many [people ,] 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [but _they] ,_ [at] , [at] [the] t [i] [there] [, _i] said_ [is] [there] [any] area [i] [should] avoid . [and] [the] guy _said_ let _me_ ask another girl here _and he_ turned [and] asked this girl [, and] _said ,_ _can_ [you] [think] [of] [any] place where dana shouldn't _go_ by herself , _or_ [anything] . [and] she , she thought [for] [a] few minutes [and] she _said ,_ no . _and he_ _said_ [is] [there] [any] place [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself . she _said ,_ no . _and they_ _said [,_ it is] [so] safe [there] [that] _you can_ leave your purse _on_ [the] subway 
B|68| M: [uh .] 
A|69| A: [and] _somebody_ will turn [it] [in] [and , and] nothing will [be] missing . [they] _said_ [they] _can_ [just] [about] guarantee [that] [there] _, that [, that_ would] [happen] _if _you_ did_ [that [.] i] thought , boy , [in] america , _if you_ left [a] purse _on_ [a] subway [, _you] would_ never [see] [it] _again_ . 
B|70| M: [yeah , yeah .] 
A|71| A: [yeah [,] that's] true , 
B|72| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|73| A: [that's] true [. [but] i] was _thinking_ boy , [in] dallas , _if_ _somebody_ asked [me] _if_ [there] [were] places [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself [at] night , i'd [have to] set [them] down [for] [about] five _or_ ten minutes [to] list _all_ [the] places [out] . 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: _i mean , i_ couldn't believe [that] she couldn't [think] [of] [any] place . [they] _said [,_ the ,] apparently [the crime] , [is ,] [just [,] uh ,] 
B|76| M: _oh , yeah , [i_ mean _,] you know [,_ that , that] [just] doesn't make sense [to] [me] either . 
A|77| A: [i'm not sure] [what] [it is] [there] . [now] [, i] [know what] [it is] [in] singapore , [is] [they] _have the_ death penalty _and they_ [really] enforce [it ,] 
B|78| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: [like] [for] drugs , [for] drugs _they , they_ enforce [the] death penalty [for] [that _.] uh [,_ they're] [just ,] very , very tough [, and [i] guess] maybe [that's the] way tokyo [is] [too] , _or_ japan [is] [too] . [they're] [just] very tough _on_ criminals . 
B|80| M: [yeah [,] well] [i _,] you know [,_ i] [don't] [know] [if] [i agree] [with] [that] [or] [not] . 
A|81| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|82| M: [i] [don't] [think] [we [have] the] [right] system [to do] [it .] 
A|83| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|84| M: [and [,] uh .] 
A|85| A: [uh-huh] , [oh] [yeah .]

A|87| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|88| M: [like] [i [said] [,] [i] [,] i] [really] [don't have] [any] problem [with] [it [.] uh ,] 
A|89| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|90| M: [so] [, [i] mean , [i] [,] i] [don't] [know] . 
A|91| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|92| M: [and [,] uh [,] i] [don't] _know [,_ [i] think] [there] [are] certain crimes _that are_ [, _that] are_ beyond [, uh] [uh ,] rehabilitation . 
A|93| A: [right] [, and] [if] [they're] overcrowded _, well , you know_ [they] shouldn't [have] [gotten] theirself [there] [in] [the] first place . 
B|94| M: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [and] [you] can't say [, well] [you know] you're sorry [, and] then [you can] [go] [back] [and] say [, [you] did] [something] wrong [and] you're [not] guilty , you're [, [you] can] still [be] tried [again] [, and] [you can] [be] tried [for] [the] same [crime] [again] , 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [and , [and] [,] uh] [you know] [it's] [just [,] i] [don't] [know] . 
A|99| A: [oh , yeah , [i] agree] [, because] [it's] [not] [fair] [to] those [of] us [that , that] deserve [a] safe [, you know ,] [life] _to have to ,_
