A|49| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|50| M: _and and_ _you know_ [that's] [a] _big_ problem [. i] [don't] _know_ [i think] [there's] [so] _much_ wrong _with_ [the] system [um] _you_ _you_ [have] [people] who [are] who [are] abusing [the] systems [and] who [are] committing crimes _that you_ can't _you_ [don't] want _them_ _out_ [of] society _for_ _any_ length [of] time . 
A|51| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|52| M: [and] [uh] [so] _you know_ [i think] [that's] _i'm not sure_ [that's] _right ._ 
A|53| A: [right] _we have_ enough enough problems [with] overcrowding [in] [the] jails _as_ [it is .] [so] let let [their] [country] [take] _care_ [of it .] 
B|54| M: [yeah] _well_ [we] we're _not_ doing _that ._ we're [we] [are] trying [to] [uh] [uh] [i] [don't] _know_ [to] make [it] [uh] 
A|55| A: [we] _don't have_ [i guess] [too much] trouble [in] dallas [with] [well [i] guess] [i guess] [we] [do] _have _a_ lot of people_ come [in] [from] mexico [that] cause problems [but uh .] 
B|56| M: uh-uh . [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [yeah .] _uh-huh ._ 
B|58| M: [and] uh-hue [i think] [that's] probably [the] most common example _and [i_ think] [uh _that's] the_ most prevalent problem . 
A|59| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|60| M: _and i_ don _i'm not sure_ [that] [they're] [as] [as] close [as] [we] might [have] [with] [the] domestic political situation . 
A|61| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|62| M: [and] [they're] still raping [people] [and] killing [people] [and] _you_ can't even imagine _that ._ 
A|63| A: _uh-huh ._ [it] was amazing [i] went [to] [the] far east [uh] _back_ [in] october [to do] some training [for] t [i] [and i] 
B|64| M: [uh] 
A|65| A: [uh] some [of] those countries [were] [so] safe [it] was unreal . singapore [is] very supposed [to] [be] very safe [and] [in] fact tokyo [and i] thought tokyo [would be] dangerous [being] such [a] huge large city [with] [so] many [people] 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [but they] [at] [at] [the] t [i] [there] _i said_ [is] [there] [any] area [i] [should] avoid . [and] [the] guy _said_ let _me_ ask another girl here _and he_ turned [and] asked this girl [and] _said_ _can_ [you] [think] [of] [any] place where dana shouldn't _go_ by herself _or_ [anything] . [and] she she thought [for] [a] few minutes [and] she _said_ no . _and he_ _said_ [is] [there] [any] place [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself . she _said_ no . _and they_ _said_ [it is] [so] safe [there] [that _you] can_ leave your purse _on_ [the] subway 
B|68| M: [uh .] 
A|69| A: [and] _somebody_ will turn [it] [in] [and and] nothing will [be] missing . [they] _said_ [they] _can_ [just] [about] guarantee [that] [there] [that [that] would] [happen] _if _you_ did_ [that [.] i] thought boy [in] america _if you_ left [a] purse _on_ [a] subway _you would_ never [see] [it] _again_ . 
B|70| M: [yeah yeah .] 
A|71| A: [yeah] [that's] true 
B|72| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|73| A: [that's] true [. but i] was _thinking_ boy [in] dallas _if_ _somebody_ asked [me] _if_ [there] [were] places [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself [at] night i'd [have to] set [them] down [for] [about] five _or_ ten minutes [to] list _all_ [the] places [out] . 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [i mean i] couldn't believe [that] she couldn't [think] [of] [any] place . [they] _said_ [the] apparently [the crime is] [just] [uh] 
B|76| M: _oh yeah [i_ mean] _you know_ [that that] [just] doesn't make sense [to] [me] either . 
A|77| A: [i'm not sure] [what] [it is] [there] . [now] [i] [know what] [it is] [in] singapore [is] [they] _have the_ death penalty _and they_ [really] enforce [it] 
B|78| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: [like] [for] drugs [for] drugs _they they_ enforce [the] death penalty [for] [that _.] uh_ [they're] [just] very very tough [and [i] guess] maybe [that's the] way tokyo [is] [too] _or_ japan [is] [too] . [they're] [just] very tough _on_ criminals . 
B|80| M: [yeah] [well i] _you know_ [i] [don't] [know] [if] [i agree] [with] [that] [or] [not] . 
A|81| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|82| M: [i] [don't] [think] [we [have] the] [right] system [to [do] [it] .] 
A|83| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|84| M: [and] [uh .] 
A|85| A: [uh-huh] [oh [yeah] .] 
B|86| M: [and they] [put] [them] [in] [there] [for] twenty years [and] [they're] still [going on] . 
A|87| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|88| M: [like] [i said] [i] [i] [really] [don't have] [any] problem [with] [it [.] uh] 
A|89| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|90| M: [so] [i mean i] [i] [don't] [know] . 
A|91| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|92| M: [and] [uh] [i] [don't] [know] [i think] [there] [are] certain crimes _that are_ _that are_ beyond [uh] [uh] rehabilitation . 
A|93| A: [right] [and] [if] [they're] overcrowded _well you know_ [they] shouldn't [have] [gotten] theirself [there] [in] [the] first place . 
B|94| M: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [and] [you] can't say [well you know] you're sorry [and] then [you can] [go] [back] [and] say [you did] [something] wrong [and] you're [not] guilty you're [you can] still [be] tried [again] [and] [you can] [be] tried [for] [the] same [crime] [again] 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [and and] [uh] [you know] [it's] [just] [i] [don't] [know] . 
A|99| A: [oh yeah [i] agree] [because] [it's] [not] [fair] [to] those [of] us [that that] deserve [a] safe [you know] [life] [to have to]

A|103| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: [and [they] they] [just] [they don't] [care] . 
A|105| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [and and] [so] [i think] [they're] [thinking] [well you know] [you] you've got [to [have] a] deterrent [and] we've got [a lot of people] _that are_ breeding [them] [so] [that] [uh] [they] can't [get] [out] [of [that] .] 
A|107| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|108| M: [and] [uh] [i] [don't] [know] [if] we've ever _had_ [a] [a] [real good] example [but uh] 
A|109| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|110| M: [but [i] think] [i think] [they're] [really] [going] [to have to] [i] [i] [don't] [know] [i] [just] [i'm] beginning [to] [think [that] that] [um] [that] [a lot of [people] are] [just] [not] [real] informed [about] [what] what's [going on] . 
A|111| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|112| M: [and he] [just] [he] [just] got caught . 
A|113| A: [right] [not] [much] . 
B|114| M: [yeah .] 
A|115| A: [yeah] huh-uh [and] especially [not] [in] some [of] these [big] cities [like] [in] dallas [i mean] they've [had] [they're] up [in] [the] top top five [i think] [of] cities [that are] getting policeman killed [on] [on] [in] [the] line [of] duty [and] [that's] [really] sad . 
B|116| M: [well [i] think] [that's] [a] [that's] [not] [a] [good] thing [i mean i] [don't] [think] [it's a] [good] idea [at all] . 
A|117| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|118| M: [and] [uh] [i mean] [it's] [it's] [just] [you know] [i] [don't] [know] [it] [just] seems [like] [you] [just] [don't] [you] [don't] want [to] over kill [somebody] [just] [because] [they're] black [or] [you know] 
A|119| A: [uh-huh .]
