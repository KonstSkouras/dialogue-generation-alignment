B|44| M:  !!! % 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and] then we [have] [a] plan [where] [, uh] we [vote] _on_ [the] local mayor

A|53| A: _yeah [,_ i] voted absentee [one] year _. [i_ really] _was_ going [to] be gone . [so [,] i] [did] [it [,] [but] , uh [,] it] _was_ nice _. i_ would be tempted [to] _do_ [it] again . 
B|54| M: _well , [it_ [,] it] [is] interesting though , _because i_ [was [,] uh] thinking [about that] [the] _other_ day [, uh] 
A|55| A: [right .] 
B|56| M: [you can] _just_ [go] [right] _ahead and_ [get] [it] . 
A|57| A: [yeah _.] [i_ think] [they] should change [the] whole system [so] [that] [it's] easier 
B|58| M: [yeah ,] 
A|59| A: [i think] _more_ _people_ would _do_ [it] if [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|60| M: [right .] [that's] true . 
A|61| A: [uh-huh] , 
B|62| M: _and [i_ think] [that's] [what] [really] works [the] _best_ [. i] [, _i] [don't_ know] how [the] [voting] [is] done [, but] [i think] [it's] done by [more] informed [people [.] i] don tinker with [the] details . [i'm] [not sure] how [it's] run . 
A|63| A: [yeah [,] that] would be [. i] usually [vote .] [a] lot [of] times i'll [vote] [a] straight party ticket [just] [because [i] don't] take [the] time [to] find [out] [what] every [, you know ,] [other] than [the] major candidates _, what_ [they] stand for [on] [what] issues , 
B|64| M: [uh [,] well] i've [, i] [have] [a] couple [of] parties [that] [i] [vote] [on] . [uh ,] [one] [of] them [is] [a] woman [, and] [one] [of the] others [is] [a] man _, and i_ [, i think] [i] [, uh] [think] [i] [like] [the] idea [of] [, uh]

B|66| M: [well ,] [that's] _good_ . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [but , uh] . 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and] [, and] [, uh] . 
A|71| A: _no _,_ i guess_ it'd be [best] if [you] knew each person [and] [what] [they] stood for [and] why [and] everything . 
B|72| M: [yeah [,] _well ,] i_ [do] [, i] [have [,] uh] 
A|73| A: [right [,] and] try [to] determine if [what] [you] read [was] objective or [not .] 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [and] _, and i_ [, i] , 
A|77| A: [yeah .] 
B|78| M: [but , uh ,] 
A|79| A: [yeah .] 
B|80| M: _and [i_ think] [that's] [one] [of the] frustrating things . 
A|81| A: [yeah [,] i think] [it] could affect [the] outcome [, you know ,] could make [it] unfair . 
B|82| M: _oh , yeah ._ 
A|83| A: [oh , yeah .] 
B|84| M: [and] then [it's] [like [,] oh ,] [no ,] [no] .

B|86| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|87| A: [yeah [,] oh [,] [but] ,] boy [you] try [get] into [that ,] you'd [really] open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|88| M: [oh [,] i] [know] . 
A|89| A: [yeah ,] seems [that] [they] should regulate themselves [a] little bit [, and [i] don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|90| M: _well [, [i_ think] [that] [,] i] mean [, i] [, uh [,] i guess] [i] agree [that , uh] [the] [, the] [, i] don [, i'm] [not sure] _, i can't think of_ [a] , [a] _good_ example , i've heard [of] [, uh [,] oh [,] well [,] what] [do] [you] call [it] ? [the] [, uh] 
A|91| A: [well [, i] can't think of] anything else [really] [about] [the] polls or [voting] , [to] talk [about] .
