B|22| M: [right] [right .] 
A|23| A: [kind of] scary when [you] [think] _about that_ .

B|26| M: [and] he's [a] [uh] [a] black [guy] [that] [that's] [that] [i] [know] _is_ [you know] sort [of] [a] closet fascist . 
A|27| A: [yeah .] 
B|28| M: [and] [uh] .

A|39| A: [yeah] _he sure did_ . 
B|40| M: [he sure did] [and] then um . 
A|41| A: [yeah _.] [i_ think] [one] _thing_ [that] maybe would help _people_ [vote] [is] if _the_ polls were either open _more_ days or [you] could mail [it] [in] or something _like_ if [you have] if [you have] real strict work hours [and _you] can_ only _go_ _like_ at seven [in] _the_ morning or after work [and [you have] to] stand [in] line for [so] long

B|44| M:  !!! % 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and] then we [have] [a] plan [where] [uh] we [vote] _on_ [the] local mayor

A|51| A: [yeah] [i'm] [in] dallas [and] they're long here too . 
B|52| M: [oh] [they] [are] . 
A|53| A: [yeah] [i] voted absentee [one] year _. [i_ really] _was_ going [to] be gone . [so] [i] [did] [it] [but uh] [it] _was_ nice _. i_ would be tempted [to] _do_ [it] again . 
B|54| M: _well it_ [it] [is] interesting though _because i_ [was] [uh] thinking [about that] [the] _other_ day [uh] 
A|55| A: [right .] 
B|56| M: [you can] _just_ [go] [right] _ahead and_ [get] [it] . 
A|57| A: [yeah _.] [i_ think] [they] should change [the] whole system [so] [that] [it's] easier 
B|58| M: [yeah] 
A|59| A: [i think] _more_ _people_ would _do_ [it] if [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|60| M: [right .] [that's] true . 
A|61| A: [uh-huh] 
B|62| M: _and [i_ think] [that's] [what] [really] works [the] _best_ [. i] _i [don't_ know] how [the] [voting] [is] done [but] [i think] [it's] done by [more] informed [people [.] i] don tinker with [the] details . [i'm] [not sure] how [it's] run . 
A|63| A: [yeah] [that] would be [. i] usually [vote .] [a] lot [of] times i'll [vote] [a] straight party ticket [just] [because [i] don't] take [the] time [to] find [out] [what] every [you know] [other] than [the] major candidates [what] [they] stand for [on] [what] issues 
B|64| M: [uh] [well] i've [i] [have] [a] couple [of] parties [that] [i] [vote] [on] . [uh] [one] [of] them [is] [a] woman [and] [one] [of the] others [is] [a] man _and i_ [i think] [i] [uh] [think] [i] [like] [the] idea [of] [uh] 
A|65| A: [so] i'll [just] trust [well] [the] party [kind of] goes along these lines [so] i'll [go] [ahead [and] vote .] 
B|66| M: [well] [that's] _good_ . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [but uh] . 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and] [and] [uh] . 
A|71| A: _no_ _i guess_ it'd be [best] if [you] knew each person [and] [what] [they] stood for [and] why [and] everything . 
B|72| M: [yeah] _well i_ [do] [i] [have] [uh] 
A|73| A: [right] [and] try [to] determine if [what] [you] read [was] objective or [not .] 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .]

A|77| A: [yeah .] 
B|78| M: [but uh] 
A|79| A: [yeah .] 
B|80| M: _and [i_ think] [that's] [one] [of the] frustrating things . 
A|81| A: [yeah] [i think] [it] could affect [the] outcome [you know] could make [it] unfair . 
B|82| M: _oh yeah ._ 
A|83| A: [oh yeah .] 
B|84| M: [and] then [it's] [like] [oh] [no] [no] . 
A|85| A: [yeah] [the] press has [a] lot [of] power . 
B|86| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|87| A: [yeah] [oh] [but] boy [you] try [get] into [that] you'd [really] open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|88| M: [oh] [i] [know] . 
A|89| A: [yeah] seems [that] [they] should regulate themselves [a] little bit [and [i] don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|90| M: _well [i_ think that] [i] mean [i] [uh] [i guess] [i] agree [that uh] [the] [the] [i] don [i'm] [not sure] _i can't think of_ [a] [a] _good_ example i've heard [of] [uh] [oh] [well] [what] [do] [you] call [it] ? [the] [uh] 
A|91| A: [well [i] can't think of] anything else [really] [about] [the] polls or [voting] [to] talk [about] .
