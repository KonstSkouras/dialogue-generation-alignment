A|1| A: uh-huh . 
B|2| M: _and_ _and_ he's he's _going _to_ be_ out _in_ two years . 
A|3| A: so you're [in] you're _in favor_ _of_ capital punishment _then_ . 
B|4| M: well _i_ _think_ _i_ mean _i_ _think_ _it's a_ good thing _but i_ _think _that_ it's_ _i don't know_ _it's_ _something_ _that_ _needs to be_ taken care [of] . 
A|5| A: _right ._ 
B|6| M: _but uh_ _i _i don't_ know_ _. _i_ guess_ i'd _have to_ say _that_ _i'm not_ [in favor] _. uh_ _i_ _think_ _it's a_ pretty good idea . 
A|7| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . [needs to be] punished _or_ [uh] eliminated from _society_ . 
B|8| M: yeah . 
A|9| A: _right ._ _and then_ do _it_ all over _again ._ uh-huh . 
B|10| M: yeah . 
A|11| A: _right ._ [have to] [agree with you] [and] [i'm] kind [of] [in favor] [of] capital punishment also [. i] _just_ [don't] [think that] _it_ acts much as [a] deterrent [to] these _people_ _because_ [uh] [you] still _see them_ committing _the_ same crimes [but i] tend [to] [agree with you] [that] [uh] we should [have] _it_ [i] _just_ [i don't _know] [that_ it's] always effective [but [i] guess] we [uh] we're kind [of] stuck [with] _it_ . [it's] [it's a] difficult [uh] problem isn't _it_ [to] determine how you're [going to] punish somebody _for a_ particular crime [uh] 
B|12| M: [right] [right .] 
A|13| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . [right] uh-huh . 
B|14| M: [and _then] you_ [see _them] in jail_ [for a] year [or] two [and] _they're_ out doing [it] [again .] 
A|15| A: uh-huh huh . do [you] [think] they should [be] punished at all [or] [uh] like go [to] prison [uh] _because_ [they're] [not] really _a danger_ [to] _society_ . [it] was almost really self defense isn't [it] [in] [a] case like [that] . 
B|16| M: yeah [. _i] i_ [you] [you] can't say [that] [they're] _they're a danger_ [but i] [uh] . 
A|17| A: uh-huh .

A|19| A: _i know_ they put [uh] put [them in jail] sometimes [i guess] [. uh] 
B|20| M: [uh] well 
A|21| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . um . uh-huh . [you] [know] now [i] wonder what [you] [think] about this [and] [uh] unfortunately we we [don't] get [to] do [it] [but uh] [it] used [to be] [a] long time ago [i guess] [in] biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did [something] [for] example [to] your family [then you] had _the_ [right] [to] administer _the_ punishment . so if somebody killed somebody [in] your family [then you] had _the_ [right] [to] [uh] if [that] person was caught [and] found guilty [you] had _the_ [right] [to] [uh] execute [that] person . [and] _i know that_ [uh] if somebody had done [something] [to] my family [i] _would_ feel [that] [i] had _the_ [right] [to] [to] get revenge on [them] [and] [uh] [but [i] i don't] [think] _that's_ done much anywhere _that's_ kind [of] drastic punishment . 
B|22| M: well [i know] [uh] 
A|23| A: [right .] 
B|24| M: [but uh] . 
A|25| A: might make [you] feel better [but] 
B|26| M: well [i] 
A|27| A: uh-huh . [right .] 
B|28| M: [because] [i know that] there _are_ _a lot of_ [people] who [would] [be] willing [to] give up their american citizenship [just] [for] [that] _very_ reason . 
A|29| A: uh-huh . [right .] uh-huh . [right] [because] [they're a danger] [to] everybody else . huh _that's_ interesting [. i] [have to] [uh] [agree with] [that] . 
B|30| M:  !!!!!! [that's] [right .] 
A|31| A: _there's [a_ lot of] folks probably [that] [are] [in] prison [that] [uh] [that] aren't really [a danger] [to] _society_ huh [and] [uh] 
B|32| M: yeah yeah [i] [think that] [that] [there's a] [a lot] [a] big part [of] [it] is [uh] [uh] [the] [the] [society] doesn't understand [uh] . 
A|33| A: [right .] [right] probably more [of] [them] [then] [the] other way around interesting [. [i] don't] [i don't] [not] sure [i] [i'm] [in] washington d c [or] at least [very] close [to] [it] . [i'm not] sure what kind [of] [uh] capital punishment we [have] here . 
B|34| M: uh-uh . 
A|35| A: uh-huh .
