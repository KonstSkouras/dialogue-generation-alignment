A|29| A: uh-huh . [right .] uh-huh . [right ,] [because] [they're a danger] [to] everybody else . huh , _that's_ interesting [. i] [have to] [, uh] [agree with] [that] .

B|32| M: yeah , yeah [, i] [think [that] [,] that] [there's a] , [a lot] , [a] big part [of] [it] is [, uh] [uh ,] [the] , [the] [society] doesn't understand [, uh] . 
A|33| A: [right .] [right ,] probably more [of] [them] [then] [the] other way around interesting [. [i] don't] [, i don't] , [not] sure [i ,] [i'm] [in] washington , d c [or] at least [very] close [to] [it] . [i'm not] sure what kind [of] [, uh ,] capital punishment we [have] here .
