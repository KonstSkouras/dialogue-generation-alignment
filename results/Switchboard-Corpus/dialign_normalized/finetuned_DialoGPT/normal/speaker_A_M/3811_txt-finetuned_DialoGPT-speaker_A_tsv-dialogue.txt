B|0| M: oh well that's _good_ . 
A|1| A: _so_ _we're_ just starting _into_ hunting _for_ child care . 
B|2| M: _yeah ._ 
A|3| A: _right_ now both _of_ _us_ are students . 
B|4| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _uh_ _uh_ _university of_ southern mississippi .

A|9| A: [yeah .] 
B|10| M: _and_ [uh] she she _got_ she was _from_ _a_ poor immigrant _family_ _and_ [uh] 
A|11| A: [uh] probably . [uh] actually spring semester [a] year [from] now he's _going to _have to_ be_ _in_ child care [uh] five days [a] week more than likely . [uh] depending _on_ how _my_ class schedule runs 
B|12| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|13| A: because _my_ wife will _be_ doing _her_ internship _that_ semester . 
B|14| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|15| A: _it_ will _be_ forty hour week not no eight _to_ five type [of] thing . 
B|16| M: oh that's great . 
A|17| A: _so_ depending _on_ what _my_ class schedule looks _like_ he may spend four anywhere [from] four _to_ eight hours [a] day _in_ child care [at] _that_ point . _right_ now _we're_ trying _to_ avoid _it_ but _we_ just as [a] matter [of] fact just yesterday hired [a a] girl _to uh_ watch him . [uh] _i_ _get_ out [of] class [at] certain time [and] _my_ wife _is_ already supposed _to be_ _on_ _her_ way _to_ _her_ class . _you know_ once [a] day this overlap happens where _we_ _can't_ _one of_ _us_ _be_ home . 
B|18| M: [right] . 
A|19| A: _so_ _for_ about twenty twenty thirty minutes [a] day _we_ [got] [a] baby-sitter comes _in_ . 
B|20| M: oh [my] goodness . 
A|21| A: [uh-huh] 
B|22| M: [and] [uh] 
A|23| A: [yeah .] 
B|24| M: [and] whether [it] was [going to] cost [us] money or whether [it] would [be] better [for] [us] [to have] [you know] our own [you] would [have to be] willing [to] sacrifice [to have] someone guide [us] . 
A|25| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: [we] could [have] had [her] there [to have] [her] dressed [uh] . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [and] _they_ live [in] [a] town called david which [is] _on the_ outskirts [of] london _. and_ they're they're very happy . _they have_ [uh] [a] very elderly population . 
A|29| A: [yeah .]

A|35| A: [uh] _that_ makes [a] big difference . 
B|36| M: [yeah] [i] think [so] . 
A|37| A: yes . 
B|38| M: _it's_ _it's_ [uh] [it] has _a lot of_ _things_ [to] offer [uh] . 
A|39| A: [yeah .] 
B|40| M: [and] 
A|41| A: _there's a lot of_ child care available but invariably _there's_ waiting lists . 
B|42| M: [yeah] that's true . 
A|43| A: [and] [we] were [a] little slow getting [on the] waiting list with [the] [uh] [okay] [the university] [uh] university's [uh] [uh] department [of] [uh] [uh] their home ec department 
B|44| M: [uh] . 
A|45| A: [uh] [they] [uh] [they have] [a] subbranch [uh] american [family] counseling [and] their people staff this this [uh] [the] child care center just off campus . but [uh] [they have] [a] pretty [good] size waiting list . 
B|46| M: oh _really_ ? 
A|47| A: [so] 
B|48| M: [and] [i] think that's [one of] [the] _things_ that's _really_ important [to] [us] [is] [to uh] [to] make sure [that] [uh] ... 
A|49| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|50| M: [you know] [it] [it] seems _like uh_ [you know] [the] longer [you] wait [the] easier [it] [is] [to] [get] somebody [you know] . 
A|51| A: [yeah .] 
B|52| M: [and] [i] think you're [right] [there's a lot of] _things_ [that] [you] could _do_ [like] [you] [you] could go [and] [and] [uh] [you know] walk [into] [a] room [and] [you] [can't] _do_ anything . 
A|53| A: [yeah .] [yeah] 
B|54| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|55| A: [a] cottage industry's [the] best way [to] [do] [it] [really] because _if_ [you] over 
B|56| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|58| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [and] [i] think [that] [we're] [really] [going to have [to] uh] 
A|61| A: yes [. and] [it's] amazing how much [good] [things] [like uh] sesame street will [do] . 
B|62| M: [i] [know] [i] [i] don't [know] [if] [it's] [uh] .
