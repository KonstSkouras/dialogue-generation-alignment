B|8| M: _yeah ._

B|14| M: _yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _it's_ _really_ sad . 
B|16| M: _it is_ . 
A|17| A: _i don't know , i just_ _think _,_ um ,_ somehow [i] hoped [that] _as a_ _people_ _we_ could [be] better than , than _, um ,_ expecting _, the_ feeling [that] [it] 
B|18| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|19| A: _with_ , _someone_ [is] calling for _someone_ _else_ _to_ [be] killed _, you _know_ ._ [is] _really_ kind [of] bad

B|22| M: _right ._ 
A|23| A: _oh_ [, i don't know ,] [is] _it ,_ _do_ [you] _feel_ at _all_ _like_ _, it's_ [a] _religious_ issue ? 
B|24| M: [i _don't] ,_ [no _.] i_ don tinker [with] [it] [that] much . 
A|25| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: _and _i_ _,_ i think_ _it's important_ _that we_ _, uh ,_ [be] aware [of] [all] [the] problems [that] _we're_ _having_ _and [i_ _think] that we_ need [to] take steps [to] correct _it ._ 
A|27| A: [um .] 
B|28| M: i'm _not_ [religious] _but [,_ _i] do_ believe [that] god works _in_ [all] [things] _through_ [all] kinds [of] grace [and _,] uh [,_ you [know _,] i] _think_ _that_ _,_ uh_ god's [going to] take care [of] us [all] _in_ _this ._ 
A|29| A: [i don't know ,] sometimes [i] _feel_ [, i] mean [i do] _go to_ church [and] [things] _. i don't _know_ how_ _i would_ _feel_ [about it .] [but] _like_ [you] say _, if_ [it] hit [you] personally , closer at home [you] _would_ _feel_ , _feel_ differently . 
B|30| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|31| A: [do] [you] [think] _most states_ [have that] or ? 
B|32| M: [most] definitely . 
A|33| A: [that] _still_ does _it [,_ that's] [right .] 
B|34| M: [i think] [so] . 
A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: _and [i_ _think] that_ [it's] [still] [, _it's] _,_ it_ [still] [is] [a] law _in_ [many] , [many] [states] [still] [. um ,] 
A|37| A: [have [that] _.] [well_ _,] and_ [it] doesn't seem _like_ very [many] _people_ [, uh ,] _are_ _really_ [, i] mean , [there's a lot of] _people that are_ [on] death row . [but] [there's] [not] very [many] _people that_ actually _, [um_ .] [do] _get_ killed . 
B|38| M: _yeah ._ 
A|39| A: [uh-huh .] _so [,_ it] seems _like_ [a] [of] _people_ live there _, and_ then [through] appeals . 
B|40| M: _yeah ._ 
A|41| A: _because [i_ know] _they_ [do] frequently [, i] mean _they_ cover , cover [it] _pretty_ heavily [on] television [and] [the] newspaper . 
B|42| M: [well ,] i'm [not] _sure_ [i've] ever [been] [to] [a] _jury that_ _didn't have_ some sort [of] background check . 
A|43| A: _if_ [it] finally _gets_ [to] [that] point . 
B|44| M: _yeah ._ 
A|45| A: [yeah .] 
B|46| M: _but [,_ um _,] i think_ [the] [appeal] process takes too long [. [i don't know] , _i] ,_ i'm [not] _sure_ [if] [they're] ready _to go_ back [and] _do [it_ .] 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [so] [is] _it [,_ uh ,] _are_ [we] doing lethal injection now ? 
B|48| M: [yeah] [, _it's] [,_ [it] [,] it] [just [,] uh] [it's] [going to] take _, uh ._ 
A|49| A: [uh-huh] , which seems [so] awful . 
B|50| M: [yeah] _, [so_ _,] uh ._ 
A|51| A: [so [,] it's] [a] little bit _more_ humane [, i] guess [, [it] _is] ,_ 
B|52| M: _uh , _i_ [,_ [i] do] [feel] _that [,_ uh] [uh [,] you know ,] [people that are] _in prison_ _, i [think_ [,] uh] _should_ [be] able _to serve_ . [uh ,] [i've] heard some talk [about it [,] _you] , you_ wouldn't [be] able [, uh] [to] sentence [someone to] _life_ without possibility [of] parole 
A|53| A: _yes_ _, the_ _other_ one [just] seems [so] terrible . 
B|54| M: [yeah] , [yeah] [, _i] [,_ [i] would] [like] [to] [see] [, uh ,] [like] _in the_ united [states] where [, uh] [you know ,] [like] [if , [if] [,] uh] [someone] [, uh] [uh [,] uh] [gets] seriously ill [, they] [, _they] [go_ to] [a] , [a] hospital [and they're] treated [like] [any] [other] [, uh] ... 
A|55| A: [um .] 
B|56| M: [i don't know , [i just] , _i] ,_ i'm [, i don't] [see] _anything_ wrong [with] [it .] 
A|57| A: [well ,] [do] [you] [think that we] [do it] _because_ _we want_ [it] [to] deter crime or [, it's] [not] _because_ _we don't_ _want to_ pay for inmates [to] stay [in prison] ? 
B|58| M: [well] _no ,_ [because [i] think] [we [want] to] [, uh ,] _have the_ best [prison] systems _in the_ world . 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [i think] [it] [just] drives [, uh [,] the] jails _down_ [, the] economy _down_ _, and i_ don [, _i] , _you_ , you_ [can't] blame [the] _people that have_ them [because] [they [want] to] [, you] [don't] _have to go_ _out_ [and] [get] them [, you] [just] _have to_ , [have] them [do] _something_ [else] . 
A|61| A: [um .] 
B|62| M: _and [i_ think] [it] _will_ [, it] _will_ help _the [,_ uh [,] the] economy . 
A|63| A: _yes ._ 
B|64| M: _but [, uh_ ,] 
A|65| A: [um _.] [well_ [,] um [,] and i] notice [that] [the] crime rate [was] up [in the] dallas area [it's [,] it's] kind [of] [been] scary , [to] [think] [about it] 
B|66| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|67| A: [and [,] and] you're hoping there [is] [something] [that] [will] cut [down] [on that .] 
B|68| M: [yes [.] well] [the] [thing] [is _,] i think_ [that's] [a] , [a] big part [of] [it [is] [that] [we] don't] [really] [know how] serious [the] problem [is] . 
A|69| A: [you] hate [to] [have the] dubious honor [of] being [, you know [,] so] [high] [in [the] [,] in] statistics , 
B|70| M: [right .] 
A|71| A: [but] _i , you know ,_ [we] [have] [been] [really] fortunate our family , hasn't _had_ [any] crime . 
B|72| M: [well [,] that's] true . 
A|73| A: [and [,] so] [we [don't] [,] it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor [people that have] suffered [that] _way_ . 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and] [how] [they] [would] expect , [how] [they] [would] hope , 
B|76| M: [yeah .] 
A|77| A: [i] mean [you , you] hear [of] [people] who _have [,_ um ,] committed crimes [, and] then _they get_ [out] [of] jail [and] [they go] [, and] [they] [do] [the] same [thing] again . 
B|78| M: _uh , [i_ [,] i don't [know] [.] [i] , you [know ,] i] [have _,] i [think_ [,] uh [,] you] [see] [it] [more] [as a] , [a] social disease . 
A|79| A: [and] [you] wonder why [they] [can't] [just] stop [it .] 
B|80| M: [uh _,] well [,_ they] can . 
A|81| A: [so ,] maybe [you] [would] , 
B|82| M: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: [but] [still] [i would] hate [to] [be] [on] [the] [jury that] sentenced [someone] . 
B|84| M: [yeah] [, [i] _,] i [think_ _that] [,_ uh [,] the] [way] [the] law reads [, uh] [you know [,] in] [most states] [it] reads [, if] [you] sentence [someone to] _life_ [in prison] [, [they] get] twenty years [and [,] uh] [they] _have a_ possibility [of] parole . 
A|85| A: [no [,] i know] when [, um ,] [we] [just ,] [we] moved here [, uh , i] from [the [,] i] got [a] summons , [jury] summons , 
B|86| M: [oh] . 
A|87| A: [just] [like] constantly [, it] seemed [like] , 
B|88| M: [well [,] that's] [, that] [is [,] _that] [,_ that] [was] [a] , [a] [pretty] wild experience . 
A|89| A: [but] fortunately [i] _had_ small children [and [i] [didn't] [have] to go] . 
B|90| M: [uh ,] [i've] [been] [in] [that] situation where [i _,] uh ._ 
A|91| A: [and] [it's] [not] [that [,] i] mean [, i think] everyone [should] [have [to] serve] [on] [the] [jury] , 
B|92| M: [right] , [right .] 
A|93| A: [it's] [just] [that [,] i didn't] [, i] hate [having] [to] [be] [in] charge [of] [someone] else's [life] . 
B|94| M: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [and [i] would] hate [to] [have to] hear [any] kind [of] case , involving [a] violent crime or [anything] . 
B|96| M: [uh , [i] would] . [uh [, i] know [,] uh [,] uh] [uh ,] my wife [and i] were [, uh [,] uh [,] in] [a] , [a] situation where [we] were recently married [and] [we] [had] [a] [, uh] [a] child [and [,] uh] [it] [was] [a] [, it] [was] [, [it] [,] it] involved [a] [, you know ,] [a] murder . 
A|97| A: [that] [would] [be] [really] awful . 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: [well ,] anyway [, i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [, uh ,] talking [to] [you] [about] [this .] although _it has_ [been] difficult [but [, uh] .] 
B|100| M: [yeah] [, [it] has] [, it's] [been] real interesting . 
A|101| A: i'd hate [to] decide [it ,] [but] [i] guess [, uh ,] guess [it's important] [, [that] we] decide [as a] [people] what , what [we're] [going to] [do] . 
B|102| M: [right .] 
A|103| A: anyway [, well , you] [have a] good day . 
B|104| M: [you] too . 
A|105| A: thank [you ,] _bye-bye_ .
