B|0| M: _uh i_ donno _i didn't_ _know_ _it_ _was_ _that_ _high_ _. i_ _i_ hadn't heard . 
A|1| A: _um_ _you know_ different _things_ _is_ [it] restricted _to_ certain crimes ? or _just_ 
B|2| M: _uh_ _well you_ _see_ _i_ i'm _not_ _sure_ _. i_ _uh _i_ know_ _that_ _in_ _in_ _uh_ _in_ my state _uh ._ 
A|3| A: _uh-huh _._ um _._ well_ . 
B|4| M: [you know] they've already ruled _on that ._ 
A|5| A: _yes_ [i know] _the_ one _thing_ [that] _i think_ _is_ _really_ sad _about it_ _as_ [i] recall from _the_ articles [that] _i've_ read _is that_ _if if_ _people_ who _have_ _been_ there _are_ _going to_ _be_ killed _. um_ _there's_ _people that_ come _to_ _the_ prisons _and they're_ very violent _and_ _they want_ [i] mean _they're_ anxious for _someone to_ _be_ killed 
B|6| M: _uh ._ 
A|7| A: _i just i_ _can't_ [see] [that .] 
B|8| M: _yeah ._ 
A|9| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|10| M: [um] _i don't know [i_ think] _there's a lot of_ [things] [that] can [be] done _about it [._ um .] 
A|11| A: _no ._ 
B|12| M: _i don't_ _have that_ problem either . 
A|13| A: [well] there _is_ _so_ _many_ chances for _appeal_ [that] [it] 
B|14| M: _yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _it's_ _really_ sad . 
B|16| M: _it is_ . 
A|17| A: _i don't know i just_ [think] [um] somehow [i] hoped [that] _as a_ _people_ _we_ could [be] better than than [um] expecting _the_ feeling [that] [it] 
B|18| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|19| A: _with_ _someone_ [is] calling for _someone_ _else_ _to_ [be] killed [you _know] ._ [is] _really_ kind [of] bad 
B|20| M: _yeah_ _that's_ true . 
A|21| A: _and_ there _really_ _are_ criminals _that are_ hard-core _and_ repeat _and_ never [have] _any_ chance for 
B|22| M: _right ._ 
A|23| A: _oh_ [i don't know] [is] [it] _do_ [you] _feel_ at _all_ _like_ _it's_ [a] _religious_ issue ? 
B|24| M: [i don't] [no _.] i_ don tinker [with] [it] [that] much . 
A|25| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: _and i_ [i think] _it's important that we_ _uh_ [be] aware [of] [all] [the] problems [that] _we're_ _having_ _and [i_ _think] that we_ need [to] take steps [to] correct _it ._ 
A|27| A: [um .] 
B|28| M: i'm _not_ [religious] _but _i_ do_ believe [that] god works _in_ [all] [things] _through_ [all] kinds [of] grace [and] _uh_ [you [know] [i] _think] that_ _uh_ god's [going to] take care [of] us [all] _in_ _this ._ 
A|29| A: [i don't know] sometimes [i] _feel_ [i] mean [i do] _go to_ church [and] [things] _. i don't _know_ how_ _i would_ _feel_ [about it .] [but] _like_ [you] say _if_ [it] hit [you] personally closer at home [you] _would_ _feel_ _feel_ differently . 
B|30| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|31| A: [do] [you] [think] _most states_ [have that] or ? 
B|32| M: [most] definitely . 
A|33| A: [that] _still_ does [it] [that's] [right .] 
B|34| M: [i think] [so] . 
A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: _and [i_ _think] that_ [it's] [still] [it's] [it] [still] [is] [a] law _in_ [many] [many] [states] [still] [. um] 
A|37| A: [have [that] _.] well_ [and] [it] doesn't seem _like_ very [many] _people_ [uh] _are_ _really_ [i] mean [there's a lot of] _people that are_ [on] death row . [but] [there's] [not] very [many] _people that_ actually [um .] [do] _get_ killed . 
B|38| M: _yeah ._ 
A|39| A: [uh-huh .] [so] [it] seems _like_ [a] [of] _people_ live there [and] then [through] appeals . 
B|40| M: _yeah ._ 
A|41| A: _because [i_ know] _they_ [do] frequently [i] mean _they_ cover cover [it] _pretty_ heavily [on] television [and] [the] newspaper . 
B|42| M: [well] i'm [not] _sure_ [i've] ever [been] [to] [a] _jury that_ _didn't have_ some sort [of] background check . 
A|43| A: _if_ [it] finally _gets_ [to] [that] point . 
B|44| M: _yeah ._ 
A|45| A: [yeah .] 
B|46| M: [but] [um] [i think] [the] [appeal] process takes too long [. [i don't know] i] i'm [not] _sure_ [if] [they're] ready _to go_ back [and] _do [it_ .] 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [so] [is] [it] [uh] _are_ [we] doing lethal injection now ? 
B|48| M: [yeah] [it's] [it] [it] [just] [uh] [it's] [going to] take _uh ._ 
A|49| A: [uh-huh] which seems [so] awful . 
B|50| M: [yeah] [so] _uh ._ 
A|51| A: [so] [it's] [a] little bit _more_ humane [i] guess [it is] 
B|52| M: _uh i_ [i do] [feel] [that] [uh] [uh] [you know] [people that are] _in prison_ [i think] [uh] _should_ [be] able _to serve_ . [uh] [i've] heard some talk [about it] _you you_ wouldn't [be] able [uh] [to] sentence [someone to] _life_ without possibility [of] parole 
A|53| A: _yes_ [the] _other_ one [just] seems [so] terrible . 
B|54| M: [yeah] [yeah] [i] [i would] [like] [to] [see] [uh] [like] _in the_ united [states] where [uh] [you know] [like] [if if] [uh] [someone] [uh] [uh] [uh] [gets] seriously ill [they] _they [go_ to] [a] [a] hospital [and they're] treated [like] [any] [other] [uh] ... 
A|55| A: [um .] 
B|56| M: [i don't know [i just] i] i'm [i don't] [see] _anything_ wrong [with] [it .] 
A|57| A: [well] [do] [you] [think that we] [do it] _because_ _we want_ [it] [to] deter crime or [it's] [not] _because_ _we don't_ _want to_ pay for inmates [to] stay [in prison] ? 
B|58| M: [well] [no] [because [i] think] [we [want] to] [uh] _have the_ best [prison] systems _in the_ world . 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [i think] [it] [just] drives [uh] [the] jails _down_ [the] economy _down_ _and i_ don _i _you_ you_ [can't] blame [the] _people that have_ them [because] [they [want] _to] you_ [don't] _have to go_ _out_ [and] [get] them [you] [just] _have _to_ have_ them [do] _something_ [else] . 
A|61| A: [um .] 
B|62| M: _and [i_ think] [it] _will_ [it] _will_ help [the] [uh] [the] economy . 
A|63| A: _yes ._ 
B|64| M: _but uh_ 
A|65| A: [um _.] well_ [um] [and i] notice [that] [the] crime rate [was] up [in the] dallas area [it's] [it's] kind [of] [been] scary [to] [think] [about it] 
B|66| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|67| A: [and] [and] you're hoping there [is] [something] [that] [will] cut [down] [on that .] 
B|68| M: [yes [.] well] [the] [thing] [is] [i think] [that's] [a] [a] big part [of] [it [is] [that] [we] don't] [really] [know how] serious [the] problem [is] . 
A|69| A: [you] hate [to [have] the] dubious honor [of] being [you know] [so] [high] [in the] [in] statistics 
B|70| M: [right .] 
A|71| A: [but _i] you know_ [we] [have] [been] [really] fortunate our family hasn't _had_ [any] crime . 
B|72| M: [well] [that's] true . 
A|73| A: [and] [so] [we don't] [it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor [people that have] suffered [that] _way_ . 
B|74| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and] [how] [they] [would] expect [how] [they] [would] hope 
B|76| M: [yeah .] 
A|77| A: [i] mean [you you] hear [of] [people] who [have] [um] committed crimes [and] then _they get_ [out] [of] jail [and] [they go] [and] [they] [do] [the] same [thing] again . 
B|78| M: _uh i_ [i don't [know] [.] [i] you [know] i] [have] [i think] [uh] [you] [see] [it] [more] [as a] [a] social disease . 
A|79| A: [and] [you] wonder why [they] [can't] [just] stop [it .] 
B|80| M: [uh] [well] [they] can . 
A|81| A: [so] maybe [you] [would] 
B|82| M: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: [but] [still] [i would] hate [to] [be] [on] [the] [jury that] sentenced [someone] . 
B|84| M: [yeah] [i] [i [think] that] [uh] [the] [way] [the] law reads [uh] [you know] [in] [most states] [it] reads [if] [you] sentence [someone to] _life_ [in prison] [they get] twenty years [and] [uh] [they] _have a_ possibility [of] parole . 
A|85| A: [no] [i know] when [um] [we] [just] [we] moved here [uh i] from [the] [i] got [a] summons [jury] summons 
B|86| M: [oh] . 
A|87| A: [just] [like] constantly [it] seemed [like] 
B|88| M: [well] [that's] [that] [is that] [that] [was] [a] [a] [pretty] wild experience . 
A|89| A: [but] fortunately [i] _had_ small children [and [i] [didn't] [have] to go] . 
B|90| M: [uh] [i've] [been] [in] [that] situation where [i] _uh ._ 
A|91| A: [and] [it's] [not] [that] [i] mean [i think] everyone [should] [have [to] serve] [on] [the] [jury] 
B|92| M: [right] [right .] 
A|93| A: [it's] [just] [that] [i didn't] [i] hate [having] [to] [be] [in] charge [of] [someone] else's [life] . 
B|94| M: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [and [i] would] hate [to [have] to] hear [any] kind [of] case involving [a] violent crime or [anything] . 
B|96| M: [uh [i] would] . [uh [i] know] [uh] [uh] [uh] my wife [and i] were [uh] [uh] [in] [a] [a] situation where [we] were recently married [and] [we] [had] [a] [uh] [a] child [and] [uh] [it] [was] [a] [it] [was] [it] [it] involved [a] [you know] [a] murder . 
A|97| A: [that] [would] [be] [really] awful . 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: [well] anyway [i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [uh] talking [to you] [about] [this .] although _it has_ [been] difficult [but [uh] .] 
B|100| M: [yeah] [it has] [it's] [been] real interesting . 
A|101| A: i'd hate [to] decide [it] [but i] guess [uh] guess [it's important that we] decide [as a] [people] what what [we're] [going to] [do] . 
B|102| M: [right .] 
A|103| A: anyway [well you] [have a] good day . 
B|104| M: [you] too . 
A|105| A: thank [you] _bye-bye_ . 
B|106| M: [bye-bye]
