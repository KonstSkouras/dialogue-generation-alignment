B|69| M: [yeah [,] i] agree . 
A|70| A: [now] [i know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] father [, uh ,] she brought [to] her [home] [, uh ,] [to] live [there [,] but] he needed [the] medical treatment [and] she had [a] [nursing] person come [in] [like] three times [a] week [to ,] [to] help him [out] .
