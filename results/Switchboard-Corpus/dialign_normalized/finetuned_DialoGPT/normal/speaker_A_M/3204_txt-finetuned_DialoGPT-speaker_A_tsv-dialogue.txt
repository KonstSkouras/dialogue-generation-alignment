A|22| A: _yes_ . 
B|23| M: _but_ [uh] . 
A|24| A: _uh _i_ think it's_ wonderful these these places [that] aren't _nursing homes_ necessarily [but] [they] can go [and] reside [there] [like] little apartments places [in] between places . 
B|25| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [and i] [like that] idea if [they] can handle _it_ themselves . _um_ 
B|27| M: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|28| A: [yeah] [yeah] 
B|29| M: [i] mean [you know] [he's] [you] can't take [your] own stuff [and] put [it] [in] this other room [and] [it] won't do [you] any _good_ . 
A|30| A: [yeah .]

B|35| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|36| A: _nursing homes_ . 
B|37| M: [yes] [and uh] . 
A|38| A: visit . 
B|39| M: _i know_ . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [um] [but] _i have_ [you know] i've done [some] _of_ [the] [uh] planning around [here .] 
A|42| A: [they] don't go [and] see [them] . [that's] right . 
B|43| M: [but] [uh _i] [i think_ that's] one _of_ [the] reasons [that] _nursing homes are_ [so] expensive . 
A|44| A: [that's] right . 
B|45| M: _so ._ 
A|46| A: [you know] [um] [i i think] [nursing homes are] [are] [um] [some] [are] [good] 
B|47| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [i [have] to] say _that ._ 
B|49| M: [yeah] [i] agree [with] _you _._ i think_ [they're] [really] [a] _a good_ thing . 
A|50| A: [but] [for] [the] [most] part [i] truly believe [that] [the] parents would [be] better if [they] were [with] [the] children . 
B|51| M: [uh i] agree [with] _you ._ 
A|52| A: [um] 
B|53| M: [um] . 
A|54| A: right right . 
B|55| M: [i [i think] that's] [a] [really] important point _. i think_ [uh] [in the] [in] our society [um] we've we're [really] _trying_ [to] [uh] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|58| A: [i] hope [so .] 
B|59| M: [yeah] _i'm_ _i know_ i've been [i was] raised [in] one [and _i] know_ [it] [you know] [the] [the] horror stories [you] _hear_ about people [going to] [the] [nursing] _home_ [and] [the] people actually dying [there] 
A|60| A: [you know] _it's_ _i think it's_ [very] difficult [in the] first place [to] make [that] choice _to have_ [them] go [there] . 
B|61| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|62| A: [and] then if [you] find [out] [that] [they] [are] _not_ having [good] care [you know] [i'm] sure [that] [it] is just [you know] you'd pull [them] [out] [of] [there] [so] fast . 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [and uh] [and] yet if [you] didn't feel [like] [you] could _be [a_ good] caretaker [i] don't [uh] _it's_ [a] [very] [very] hard decision [i think] . 
B|65| M: [yeah] [i] agree . 
A|66| A: [uh-huh [.] [i think] that's] right 
B|67| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|68| A: [and] especially if you're _not_ [a] person [that] is [like] [a] medical person maybe or something [that] [the] person needs medical treatment . 
B|69| M: [yeah] [i] agree . 
A|70| A: [now] [i know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] father [uh] she brought [to] her [home] [uh] [to] live [there] [but] he needed [the] medical treatment [and] she had [a] [nursing] person come [in] [like] three times [a] week [to] [to] help him [out] . 
B|71| M: uh-uh . 
A|72| A: [and] [that] might _be a_ partial solution or something . 
B|73| M: _well [i_ think that's] probably [the] only way [that] we're [going to] get [to] [that [.] [i think] it's] [going [to] [have] [to] be a] continuing problem . 
A|74| A: [but] [um] [i] personally am [for] [the] [trying] [it] at [home] caretaker part before [i think] i'd ever 
B|75| M: [uh] 
A|76| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [and] [i'm] [not] [i'm] [i think] we're probably [going [to] be] talking about [uh] [going] into [the] [nursing] [home] . 
A|78| A: [well [i] i think] we kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|79| M: [i] do [too] .
