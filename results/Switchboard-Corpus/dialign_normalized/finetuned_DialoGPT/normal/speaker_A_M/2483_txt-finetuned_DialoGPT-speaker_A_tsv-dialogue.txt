A|54| A: [we] [have] [it] [in the] break area , _c n_ [n] . [and [,] but] [the] reason [i] _say_ [that] is _on_ [the] radio they'll _say_ [and] look at this _, you know_ . [and] when [i] first _heard_ _c n_ [n [,] it] only started about [, uh] , since [the] war _, you know ,_ or _right_ before [that] . [and ,] [they] would always _say_ [and] look at this [, and] there would be [a] pause _, you know ,_ would be music [and] [stuff] [and i] realized [that] [it's] [the] exact commentary [that] _you_ [have] _on_ [the] [, uh] [, the] news . 
B|55| M: [right .] 
A|56| A: [yeah ,] [yeah .] _but ,_ [it's] still [good .] [it's] still [, uh] [, uh] _, you know _,_ you_ [don't] [really] miss [anything] .
