B|54| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|55| A: [and] [of] course [you know] [they] tried [to] make [the] cop look [like] he [was] [uh [a] uh] no [good] rotten drunk . 
B|56| M: [yeah [yeah] .] 
A|57| A: _i mean_ [it was] amazing . 
B|58| M: [well] [that's] [that] [is] [a] [a] frightening [thought] . 
A|59| A: [oh] he [was] found guilty [yeah .] 
B|60| M: [and uh] . 
A|61| A: he [uh] um last [i] heard he [uh] he beat [a] push for [the] death penalty . now whether [they] finally got [it] or _not_ [i don't [know] .]

B|66| M: okay . 
A|67| A: [right .] [and uh] [yeah] everybody everybody [was] pretty much [you know] let's burn him . 
B|68| M: [yeah [yeah] .] 
A|69| A: [and] [that's] [you know] [that's] [the] [way] [they] wanted [to] [do] [it .] [and] he [was] surprised because he [thought] there [was] going [to be a] problem because he [uh you know] some [people] on [the] case [were] [were] [a] little hesitant on convicting him on some [of] [the] charges _but [i_ mean] when [it] all came down [they] [just] within an hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|70| M: [yeah .] 
A|71| A: [yeah .] 
B|72| M: [you know] [i think] [that] [you [have] a] [you] can [have] civil rights [but] [it's] [not] equal [to] equal rights . 
A|73| A: [yeah yeah] [well it] [it] [it] went pretty pretty quick from what he said . 
B|74| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|75| A: _but [i_ mean] [there's] [there's] [there's a lot of] other crimes out there [i mean] besides murder [i think] [uh] now [if] [you're] dealing drugs now caught [more] than twice or something [uh] [it] [there's] [uh a] death penalty associated [with] [it .] 
B|76| M: [right .] 
A|77| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: [i mean] [you] [can't] imagine [that] [you] could [you] couldn't imagine [a] [a] [you] [you're] [not] [a] hero [you] [don't] [you] wouldn't [be] [able to] [kill] [uh] 
A|79| A: [yeah [yeah] i] agree . 
B|80| M: [i] [i] [i don't know] [i] feel [like] i'm [not] saying [that] [it's] [right] [but [i] think] [that] [that uh] . 
A|81| A: [yeah i] agree [i] i've [i] [have] [uh a] low tolerance for [that] [kind of] [uh] [that] [kind of] [person] . [and uh] as far as [uh you know] there are some some other crimes [that [i] think] [uh you know] [uh] kidnapping um [you know] when [they] [i mean] kidnapping per se has [a] certain [uh] [uh] fine [and] penalty associated [with] [it] 
B|82| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|83| A: [but] um some [of] these [people] are [just] out [and] out brutal [. i] some [of] [the] cases i've heard about over [the] years
