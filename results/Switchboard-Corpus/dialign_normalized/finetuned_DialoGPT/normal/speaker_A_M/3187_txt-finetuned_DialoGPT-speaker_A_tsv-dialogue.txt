B|16| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|17| A: [and] i've _got_ little children here who needed me here _she_ needed somebody [to] watch her twenty-four hours [a] day . 
B|18| M: [right .] 
A|19| A: _so_ . _she_ [was] falling down [and] hemorrhaging _and , you_ know , all kinds [of] physical problems , _so_ _it_ _just_ became [too] much [for] me [to] handle , even though [i] [would] _have_ liked _to have_ [had] her stay , _with_ her health being what _it_ [was] _she_ _couldn't_ _anymore ._ 
B|20| M: [yeah ,] _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|22| M: [and we] [just] [couldn't] deal [with] [it] . 
A|23| A: [oh] . 
B|24| M: [and , you] [, you] [got [to] have] [that] space [and [,] and] [time] [, [and] ,] uh [, you] [could] really _feel_ like [you] [were] _in the_ house . 
A|25| A: [yeah .] 
B|26| M: [so ,] 
A|27| A: yes , well [, i think] sometimes when people get [to] [be] [a] certain age , other people [have] [to] [kind of] help them _make_ decisions . [it] sure wouldn't [have] been granny's decision [to] leave _us_ [and] go back [to] [a] nursing home , but _she's_ accepted [it] real well now 
B|28| M: [yeah ,] [yeah [,] i] don't [think] [she] feels like [she's] [a] whole lot [of] responsibility [anymore .] 
A|29| A: [so] . 
B|30| M: [i think] [it's] probably best _for us to_ [do] [that ,] _because_ [i think] [it] [would] [make] [a] lot [of] difference . 
A|31| A: well , [we] enjoyed having her here , 
B|32| M: [oh ,] [that] [was] wonderful . 
A|33| A: but [we] [feel] [she's] much safer where [she] is now . [she] still continues [to] fall , but when [she] does there , [a] nurse is [right] there [to] help her 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! translated [it's] really [a] good idea . 
A|35| A: [and] [i] know [she's] eating [the] [right] things [, and] her doctor's [right] there where he can come [in] [and] check on her , [so] . [it] became dangerous [for us to] keep transporting her back [and] forth [in the] car [because] [she] [was] [so] wobbly [and] needed [a] walker or [a] wheel chair 
B|36| M: uh . uh-hum . 
A|37| A: [so [,] i think] she'll adjust ,
