A|11| A: [yeah .] 
B|12| M: _okay [i_ _i] think i've_ heard [about] [that] . 
A|13| A: [i] _just_ [like] [i] _just_ finished watching [that] [a] few minutes ago [um] _and_ _it and_ [that] _that's_ [a] interesting _one_ [. [i] [i] [i] like] [that] _because_ _there's_ _there_ _are_ [i've] noticed [that] every every major station _now_ has their own _law_ show . _there's_ _l_ [a] _law and_ _there's_ [um] equal justice _some_ other _one_ _law and order_ or _something_ . _do_ _you_ _like the_ _law_ shows or

A|17| A: _also_ saves _a lot of_ _time_ with commercials . 
B|18| M: [well] _yeah [i_ guess] [that's] true [that] _is_ true . 
A|19| A: _oh [i_ have] . [i've] _i've i_ watched [that] late _um [i_ guess] _it's on_ late _saturday_ nights or _something_ 
B|20| M: [yeah] [it's] [it [was] on] [uh] [saturday night] . 
A|21| A: [that's] entering [the] day _as_ [well] . 
B|22| M: [oh yeah] [it] _is_ [it's] _it it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|23| A: [have] [you] [have] [have] [you] [seen] _this_ often ? 
B|24| M: [um] _yeah _i_ saw_ [it] [um] . 
A|25| A: _oh really ?_

A|27| A: [yeah .] 
B|28| M: _and i_ [watch] [it] [at] five _thirty_ _in the_ morning 
A|29| A: _really ?_ [i] 
B|30| M: _and so_ [you know] [it's] _it it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|31| A: [that] [don't] [it [it] it] seems [like] _i mean_ _if_ wrestling [is] prime _time_ professional wrestling [it] seems [like it's] [just] [just] [just] [like] pros [in] [a] wrestling [to] _me_ [i don't] [i don't] [see] any difference though 
B|32| M: [yeah [.] [yeah] .] 
A|33| A: _i i don't_ understand [it] _they_ consider [it] violent [. [i] have] [so] ever [i have] [seen] [it] [on] where _we_ _are_ [i] live [in] [uh] rochester new york [and [i] think] [a] 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that] . 
A|35| A: _yes_ . 
B|36| M: [oh really ?] 
A|37| A: where _are_ [you] ?

B|40| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|41| A: [i think] [it's] been [on] [i think [i've] seen] [it] during [the] day . 
B|42| M:  !!! % !!?!! remind [me] . 
A|43| A: definitely [seen] [it] [on] [on] during [the] day down _there_ [and [i] don't] [think] [it's] [a] very violent show [i think] [it's] [funny [.] [i] think] [it's] [a] _real good_ concept [i think] [it's] _something_ completely new . 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! ; !! etwork !! remind [me] . 
A|45| A: [i think] [so] [i think] [because] people _sort of_ _get_ through [you know] _um i _think_ that_ people _sort of_ learn [the] importance [of] _sort of_ physical fitness _as_ [well] _as_ [the] _as_ [well] _as_ [you know] _some_ mental fitness [and [i] _think] that_ people _sort of_ learn _good_ sportsmanship [and so] forth . 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [well] [don't] _they_ _take_ people _who_ [have] _some_ _sort of_ [um] _big_ abilities [like] [and] [and] [at] least _they_ used [to] _when_ [it] _when_ [it] [the] first ones [i saw] _they_ had [um] [a] man [on] _who_ [was] [uh] _he_ played college football [and] almost _went_ pro _and they_ had [a] [a] woman _who_ [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] _the uh_ she [was] [in the] junior olympics or _something_ or _they_ seem [to] [have] people _who_ [have] very very _big_ sports backgrounds . [to] [have] _they_ leaned away from [that] _sort of_ 
B|48| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|49| A: [oh] [that's] _how_ _they do_ [it .]

B|54| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah _i] thought_ [they] had _some_ _sort of_ _i mean _i_ thought_ [they] were [just] poor people [like] us [i guess] _not_ [that's] _great_ . 
B|56| M: [well] [i [i don't] know] [i've [i] think i] [really] [think [that] _um] the_ way _things_ [have] changed over [the] years [and] [um i think the] [the] women's movement [sort of] brought [in the] individuality [i guess] rather than [the uh] 
A|57| A: [but] maybe i'll try [it] _one_ day . i'll _get_ [on] _there_ _one_ day [and] [see] _if_ [i] [can] [uh] [um] _what_ _what_ _do_ [they] win [they] [they] win money [i think] [don't] [they] ? 
B|58| M: _yeah [they_ do] . 
A|59| A: [really ?] 
B|60| M: [yeah so] .

[so] [i] [was] actually actually [i'm not sure] [i] [was] [in] [i] [was] [in] iowa awhile ago [and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier [so] does [your] prime _time_ start [at] seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M: [um [i] don't know] [i i] [went] [to] school [in] [central time] zone [and [i] thought] [it was] five _thirty_ .

B|94| M: [right] . 
A|95| A: [yeah] [that] [that] would [all] start [at] [at] [um] [that] would [all] start [at] [at] eight o'clock here [that] wouldn't start [at] seven . [we] [have] [um] [at] seven o'clock [we] [just] [have] [um the] they'll play [you know] [they have] old reruns [of] cheers or [something] from seven [to] seven [thirty] [and then] [something] else from seven [thirty] [to] eight 
B|96| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|97| A: [and] ours start [at] [at] [at] [at] eight [and] end [at] eleven [that's] why [we] [. [i] i] would actually [like] [it] better [if] everything started [at] seven [and] ended [at ten] . 
B|98| M: [oh [yeah] .] 
A|99| A: [oh] [that's] [great] .
