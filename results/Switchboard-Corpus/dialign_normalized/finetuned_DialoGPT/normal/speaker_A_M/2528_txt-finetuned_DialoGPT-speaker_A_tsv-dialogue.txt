B|4| M: [oh] . 
A|5| A: _yeah , _so_ ,_ twin peaks _, um ,_ _what_ happened _was_ _, i think ,_ twin peaks _, um ,_ _went_ , _went_ off _, they_ moved _to_ _a_ _saturday night_ _for_ _a_ while _. _and_ then_ _put_ _, and then_ _put_ _something_ _, i guess ,_ gabriel's fire _on_ _it , and_ _at_ thursday nights _, _and then_ they_ moved _, um ,_ _no ,_ gabriel's fire _was on_ _c_ b s _, i think _, i_ , i_ _take_ _that_ back _. i'm not sure_ _, but_ anyway _they_ moved _it_ back _and_ forth _and_ _that's_ _when_ peaks _was_ back _in_ _that_ _time_ slot _as_ _well_ . _so _,_ i don't know_ . 
B|6| M: [i] _see_ .

B|8| M: _oh , okay ._ 
A|9| A: _um _,_ it's_ hard _to say_ _i'm_ _sort _of_ a_ very _big_ twin peaks _fan_ _, and_ beyond _that_ [i] _just_ _sort of_ _watch_ anything _that_ happens _to_ be _on_ _. i'm_ _, i'm_ , half _the_ _time_ _i'm_ _a_ t _v_ addict _and_ _the_ other half _the_ _time_ [i] _just_ ignore _it_ _it's_ _really_ bad _. _yeah_ _,_ _there's_ some_ new shows _that_ [i] _sort of_ _like _,_ um ,_ _have_ _you_ _seen_ _this_ shannon field show or _, uh _,_ it's_ _about_ _a_ lawyer _, it's_ _one_ _of_ _these_ lawyer shows _, you know _,_ they_ seem _to_ be popular _these_ days _. and_ _there's _a_ lot of_ those blair shows floating _around_ . 
B|10| M: [yeah _,] _i've_ seen_ [a lot] _. i [,_ um] [. _i] like_ _to watch _the_ [,_ um] [the] anchors [, i] can't [think] [of] [the] name [of] _the _,_ the_ anchors . they're usually pretty _funny ._ 
A|11| A: [yeah .] 
B|12| M: _okay [, i_ _, i] think i've_ heard [about] [that] . 
A|13| A: [i] _just_ [like] [i] _just_ finished watching [that] [a] few minutes ago _, um _,_ and_ _it_ _and _,_ _that_ _,_ that's_ [a] interesting _one_ [. [i [,] i] _, i] like_ _that ,_ _because_ _there's_ , _there_ _are_ [, i've] noticed [that] every , every major station _now_ has their own _law_ show . _there's_ _l_ [a] _law_ _, and_ _there's_ _, um ,_ equal justice , _some_ other _one_ , _law and order_ or _something_ . _do_ _you_ _like the_ _law_ shows or , 
B|14| M: [no [, i] don't] [watch] [law and order] [, but] [i [,] uh] [i [like] [,] uh] 
A|15| A: _that _,_ that_ makes logic , 
B|16| M: [yeah [.] _and] [i_ have] [a] [v] [c] r , which [i like] [because] [it's] [like [,] it's] more convenient [, you know [,] you] _can_ [just] go _right_ _on the_ computer [and] record [it , and] [watch] _it ._ 
A|17| A: _also_ saves _a lot of_ _time_ with commercials . 
B|18| M: [well [,] _yeah [,] i_ guess] [that's] true [, that] _is_ true . 
A|19| A: _oh , [i_ have] . _i've _,_ i've , i_ watched [that] late _, _um [,_ i_ guess] _it's on_ late _saturday_ nights or _something_ , 
B|20| M: [yeah _,] it's [,_ it [was] _on] [,_ uh ,] [saturday night] . 
A|21| A: [that's] entering [the] day _as_ [well] . 
B|22| M: [oh] [yeah [,] it] _is_ _, it's _,_ it , it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|23| A: [have] _you ,_ [have] , [have] [you] [seen] _this_ often ? 
B|24| M: [um [,] _yeah ,] _i_ saw_ [it [,] um] . 
A|25| A: _oh , really ?_ 
B|26| M: _yeah [, and_ then] , [of] course [, i] [watch] [it] [at] five _thirty_ _in the_ morning . 
A|27| A: [yeah .] 
B|28| M: _and i_ [watch] [it] [at] five _thirty_ _in the_ morning , 
A|29| A: _really ?_ [i ,] 
B|30| M: _and [so_ [,] you know _,] it's _,_ it , it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|31| A: [that] [don't] [, it [, it] , it] seems [like [,] _i] mean ,_ _if_ wrestling [is] prime _time_ , professional wrestling [, it] seems [like] [it's] [just] , [just] , [just] [like] pros [in] [a] wrestling [to] _me_ [, i don't] [, i don't] [see] any difference though , 
B|32| M: [yeah [.] [yeah] .] 
A|33| A: _i , i don't_ understand [it _,] they_ consider [it] violent [. [i] have] [so] ever [, [i] have] [seen] [it] [on ,] where _we_ _are_ [, i] live [in] [, uh ,] rochester , new york _, and [i_ think] [a] , 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that] . 
A|35| A: _yes_ . 
B|36| M: [oh , really ?]

B|40| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|41| A: [i think] [it's] been [on [,] i think [i've] seen] [it] during [the] day . 
B|42| M:  !!! % !!?!! remind [me] . 
A|43| A: definitely [seen] [it] [on ,] [on ,] during [the] day down _there_ _, and [i_ don't] [think] [it's] [a] very violent show [, i think] [it's] [funny [.] [i] think] [it's] [a] _real good_ concept [, i think] [it's] _something_ completely new . 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! ; !! etwork !! remind [me] . 
A|45| A: [i think] [so [,] i think] [because] people _sort of_ _get_ through [, you know _,] _um [,_ i_ _think] that_ people _sort of_ learn [the] importance [of] _sort of_ physical fitness _as_ [well] _as_ [the ,] _as_ [well] _as_ [, you know ,] _some_ mental fitness [and [i] _think] that_ people _sort of_ learn _good_ sportsmanship [and so] forth . 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [well ,] [don't] _they_ _take_ people _who_ [have] _some_ _sort of_ _, um ,_ _big_ abilities [like] _and [,_ and] [at] least _they_ used [to] _when_ [it ,] _when_ [it [,] the] first ones [i saw] _they_ had _, um ,_ [a] man [on] _who_ [was] [, uh ,] _he_ played college football [and] almost _went_ pro [, _and] they_ had [a] , [a] woman _who_ [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] _the [, uh_ ,] she [was] [in the] junior olympics or _something_ or _they_ seem [to] [have] people _who_ [have] very , very _big_ sports backgrounds . [to] [have] _they ,_ leaned away from [that] _sort of_ , 
B|48| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|49| A: [oh _,] that's_ _how_ _they do_ [it .]

B|54| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah , _i] thought_ [they] had _some_ _sort of_ [, _i] mean , _i_ thought_ [they] were [just] poor people [like] us [i guess] _not_ _, that's_ _great_ . 
B|56| M: [well [,] [i [, i] don't] [know] [,] i've [, i] think , i] [really] [think [that] _, um ,] the_ way _things_ [have] changed over [the] years [and [,] um] [i think [the] [,] the] women's movement [sort of] brought [in the] individuality [, i guess ,] rather than [the , uh] 
A|57| A: _but ,_ maybe i'll try [it] _one_ day . i'll _get_ [on] _there_ _one_ day [and] [see] _if_ [i] [can] [, uh [,] um ,] _what_ , _what_ _do_ [they] win _, [they_ _,] they_ win money [i think ,] [don't] [they] ? 
B|58| M: _yeah , [they_ do] . 
A|59| A: [really ?] 
B|60| M: [yeah , so] . 
A|61| A: _wow_ . _all_ [that] _for_ getting _tennis_ balls shot [at] [you] [at] [a] hundred miles an hour .

[i] mean [, i] like] _to watch the_ [ball] go [around] [, [you] [,] [but] [,] i] [really] [don't] [like] [to] [see] [the] [ball] hit [in the] air [, you] [get] hit [in] _your_ hand [, and] [you] [get] caught [up] [in] [it .] 
A|65| A: [they] look [like [,] [yeah ,] they] seem [like] [a tennis] [ball] [but] [it] almost doesn't look [like] [it's] almost livable [yeah [,] the] best [i , i don't] [think] [i] could [, i , i] could handle those [tennis] balls .

[so [,] i] [was] actually , actually [i'm not sure] [, i] [was] [in] [, i] [was] [in] iowa awhile ago [, and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier [, [so] ,] does [your] prime _time_ start [at] seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M: [um [, i] don't [know] [,] i , i] [went] [to] school [in] [central time] zone [, and [i] thought] [it was] five _thirty_ . 
A|89| A: wait , [no ,] [no ,] 
B|90| M: [but [,] um] . 
A|91| A: [not] , [not] even [the] news [but] [do] [they have] [like [,] um ,] [do] [like] [sort of] [all] [the] regular sitcoms [and so] forth , start [at] seven o'clock ? [you [,] [so] ,] [like [,] you know [,] the] regular television shows [that] [are] [, that] [are] very popular , [do] [they] start [at] , seven or , or [at] eight ? 
B|92| M: [yeah [,] yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|93| A: [right] , [because] [that] would [the] eight o'clock here . 
B|94| M: [right] . 
A|95| A: [yeah [,] [that] [,] that] would [all] start [at] , [at] [, um [,] that] would [all] start [at] , [at] eight o'clock here [, that] wouldn't start [at] seven . [we] [have] [, um ,] [at] seven o'clock [we] [just] [have] [, um , [the] ,] they'll play [, you know [,] [they] have] old reruns [of] cheers or [something] from seven [to] seven [thirty] [, and then] [something] else from seven [thirty] [to] eight 
B|96| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|97| A: [and] ours start [at] , [at] , [at] , [at] eight [and] end [at] eleven [, that's] why [we] [. [i ,] i] would actually [like] [it] better [if] everything started [at] seven [and] ended [at ten] . 
B|98| M: [oh , [yeah] .] 
A|99| A: [oh [,] that's] [great] . 
B|100| M: [and , uh [,] [and] , uh] [i guess] [there's [some] [,] [there's] a] [little] bit [of a] decline [in the] family values [, [but] [,] uh] . 
A|101| A: [oh ,] [all] [the] [time] . [do] [you] [watch] cheers
