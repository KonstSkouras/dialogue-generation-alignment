B|6| M: [uh] . 
A|7| A: _and_ _so_ _what_ _we_ _did_ _was_ draw up _a_ budget _that_ _we_ thought [uh] _was_ realistic . 
B|8| M:  !!! % !! ; !!!!! remind [me] . 
A|9| A: _and uh_ _so_ _we_ _had _to_ make_ _some_ adjustments _because_ _we_ _really_ _are_ kind _of_ _looking_ for _something_ _that_ _we_ _want _to_ do_ _and_ _he_ wants _to do_ _that's_ satisfactory _and_ _we've been_ here seven months _and_ _he's_ still hasn't hit up on anything permanently . 
B|10| M: _well _i_ know_ [that] [my] husband's [been] working [and] [and] doing other _things_ with his life [and uh] [he's] [had to] _take_ care [of] his _own_ business . 
A|11| A: _so_ _you_ _see_

B|14| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|15| A: [uh] [that] _god_ _because_ *listen [it] never occurred [to] [it] never occurred [to] us [that] [it] _would_ [take] seven months . 
B|16| M: yeah . 
A|17| A: [and uh] _what_ _we_ _did_ _was_ [just] [uh] decide _how_ _we_ [had] [been] spending our _money_ before 
B|18| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|19| A: [and] _then_ _we_ put [that] on [the] computer [and] _then_ _we_ took about three months [and uh] [and] adjusted where _we_ could come down [and] where _we_ didn't _want to_ come down 
B|20| M: yeah . 
A|21| A: _and we_ _really_ [uh] lessened [it] [uh] our living expenses [uh] more than _what_ _we_ thought _we_ _would_ . 
B|22| M: yeah . 
A|23| A: _but_ 
B|24| M: _i think_ _i think that's_ [really] _important_ 
A|25| A: [oh] [just] our [own] design . 
B|26| M: [oh] . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [and uh] _it _it_ was_ it's [really] neat . 
A|29| A: [and] [the] _so_ _but_ _we've_ [had] budgets [that] didn't _work_ when our [uh] _you know_ [of] our first fifteen years or eighteen years [of] being married nothing worked 
B|30| M: [uh] 
A|31| A: _we_ spent [too] _much_ _money_ until our children went [to] college _so_ . _so_ tell [me] about 
B|32| M: _well i_ _i _have_ a_ sister who's [a] [a] _uh a_ _an_ english major who's _in uh_ 
A|33| A: [do] _you_ _all_ [uh] [have a] budget ?

A|43| A: [well [i] think that's] [important] for [your] budget [to] be for [it] [to] _work_ though [you] [have] _to do something_ . 
B|44| M: _right_ . 
A|45| A: [of] course _not_ . 
B|46| M: [but] 
A|47| A: [well i] found [uh] [that] _in the_ _place_ [that] [it was] harder for [me] [to] stick [to] [a] budget [was] _not_ where _we_ were concerned [but] where maybe our friends were concerned [and] our relatives [and] parents . 
B|48| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|49| A: [uh] _we_ _we_ tended [to] _want to_ keep on giving lavish gifts _as_ _we_ [had] done before . 
B|50| M: yeah . 
A|51| A: [and] [i] [really] believe [that] _if_ you're _going to_ cut down on yourself [you] need [to] cut down somewhat on [your] friends . 
B|52| M: _right_ . 
A|53| A: yes . 
B|54| M: [and [we] both] [know] [that] [that's] [not] [going to] happen . 
A|55| A: [well i] [really] [do] [i think] [you] [have] [to] budget those [things] though . 
B|56| M: _i know_ . 
A|57| A: yes . 
B|58| M: [and] _you don't [want_ to] _over_ [do] [it] _you want [to_ make] [it a] habit . 
A|59| A: exactly although _so_ _much_ per month anyway . 
B|60| M: _right_ _right_ . 
A|61| A: [and uh] [that] [really] should be [in] [your] [but] _if_ [you don't] spend [it it] should be [in] [your] bank account at [the] end [of] [the] month 
B|62| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [oh] _no_ _no_ _no_ _no_ . 
B|64| M: [so] [we're] [not] allowed [to] add any deductions [and] [we're] even [going to] try [to] [to] add [some] [in _the] the_ interest . 
A|65| A: [you don't want] [the] government [to] spend [your] _money_ . [you want to] be _able_ 
B|66| M: [no] [i think] [that] [i] [i] agree with [you] [i] [would] [much] rather [have] [the] [money] [to do something] like [that] . 
A|67| A: [well] [uh] [but] [i] [do] realize [that] [that] _is_ realistic for [some] people
