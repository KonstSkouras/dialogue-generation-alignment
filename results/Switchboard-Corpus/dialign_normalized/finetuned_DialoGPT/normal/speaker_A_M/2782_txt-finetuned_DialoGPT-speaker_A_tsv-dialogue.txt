B|8| M:  !!! % !! ; !!!!! remind [me] . 
A|9| A: _and , uh ,_ _so_ , _we_ _had _to_ make_ _some_ adjustments _because_ _we_ _really_ _are_ kind _of_ _looking_ for _something_ _that_ _we_ _want _to_ do_ _and_ _he_ wants _to do_ _that's_ satisfactory _, and_ _we've been_ here seven months _and_ _he's_ still hasn't hit up on anything permanently .

B|16| M: yeah . 
A|17| A: _and , uh ,_ _what_ _we_ _did_ _was_ [just] _, uh ,_ decide _how_ _we_ [had] [been] spending our _money_ before , 
B|18| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|19| A: [and] _then_ _we_ put [that] on [the] computer [and] _then_ _we_ took about three months _and , uh [,_ and] adjusted , where _we_ could come down [and] where _we_ didn't _want to_ come down , 
B|20| M: yeah . 
A|21| A: _and we_ _really_ _, uh ,_ lessened _it _,_ uh ,_ our living expenses _, uh ,_ more than _what_ _we_ thought _we_ _would_ . 
B|22| M: yeah . 
A|23| A: _but ,_ 
B|24| M: _i think_ _, i think that's_ [really] _important_ , 
A|25| A: [oh ,] [just] our [own] design . 
B|26| M: [oh] . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [and , uh _,] _it_ , _it_ was_ , it's [really] neat . 
A|29| A: [and] _the ,_ _so_ , _but_ _we've_ [had] budgets [that] didn't _work_ when our [, uh _,] you know_ , [of] our first fifteen years or eighteen years [of] being married nothing worked 
B|30| M: [uh ,] 
A|31| A: _we_ spent [too] _much_ _money_ , until our children went [to] college , _so_ . _so_ , tell [me] about , 
B|32| M: _well , i_ _, i _have_ a_ sister who's [a] [, a] [, uh] [a] , _an_ english major who's _in , uh_ 
A|33| A: [do] _you_ _all_ [, uh ,] [have a] budget ?

B|42| M: [and ,] um [we've been] trying , um . [we've] tried everything [, you] _can_ go [to] any store [and] [you] _can_ [take] _your_ clothes _out of_ _your_ [own] clothes [, and] they're [just] like , [oh ,] [how] nice , [how] neat . 
A|43| A: [well [, i] think that's] [important] for [your] budget [to] be for [it] [to] _work_ though [, you] [have] _to do something_ . 
B|44| M: _right_ . 
A|45| A: [of] course _not_ . 
B|46| M: [but ,] 
A|47| A: [well , i] found [, uh ,] _that ,_ _in the_ _place_ [that] [it was] harder for [me] [to] stick [to] [a] budget [was] _not_ where _we_ were concerned , [but] where maybe our friends were concerned [and] our relatives [and] parents . 
B|48| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|49| A: [uh ,] _we_ , _we_ tended [to] _want to_ keep on giving lavish , gifts _as_ , _we_ [had] done before . 
B|50| M: yeah . 
A|51| A: [and] [i] [really] believe [that] _if_ you're _going to_ cut down on yourself [, you] need [to] cut down somewhat on [your] friends . 
B|52| M: _right_ . 
A|53| A: yes . 
B|54| M: [and [we] both] [know] [that] [that's] [not] [going to] happen . 
A|55| A: [well , i] [really] [do] [, i think] [you] [have] [to] budget those [things] though . 
B|56| M: _i know_ . 
A|57| A: yes . 
B|58| M: [and] _you don't [want_ to] _over_ [do] [it [,] _you] want [to_ make] [it] [a] habit . 
A|59| A: exactly , although _so_ _much_ per month anyway . 
B|60| M: _right_ _, right_ . 
A|61| A: [and , uh ,] [that] [really] should be [in] [your] [but] _if_ [you don't] spend [it , it] should be [in] [your] bank account at [the] end [of] [the] month 
B|62| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [oh ,] _no ,_ _no ,_ _no ,_ _no_ . 
B|64| M: [so] [we're] [not] allowed [to] add any deductions [, and] [we're] even [going to] try [to] , [to] add [some] [in _the] , the_ interest . 
A|65| A: [you don't want] [the] government [to] spend [your] _money_ . [you want to] be _able_ , 
B|66| M: [no [,] i think] [that [,] i] [, i] agree with [you] [, i] [would] [much] rather [have] [the] [money] [to do something] like [that] . 
A|67| A: [well [,] uh ,] [but] [i] [do] realize [that ,] [that] _is_ realistic for [some] people , 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: [and] [it was] for us many years , for many years . 
B|70| M: yeah [, i think] [it was] [, [it] was] [a] dream back [then] [too] [, you know] . 
A|71| A: [uh [,] and] _if_ [, and] _if_ _that's the_ only _way_ [that] will [, it] will [make] [you] save [and] [have a] little nest egg at [the] end [of] [the , the] year [then] doggone [it] [that's] _what_ [you] should [do] . 
B|72| M: [that's] _right_ . 
A|73| A: [uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] [well , i] [was] [just] reading [an] article [in [, uh] [,] a] north carolina paper today where [a] high school [student] obtained [over] _two_ hundred thousand dollars worth [of] scholarships for herself by sitting up at night [and] typing at [, uh ,] letters [of] applications [to] universities . 
B|74| M: [oh ,] [really] . 
A|75| A: she [was] she [was] third [out of] [a] class [of] _two_ hundred [and] twenty , [so] [, it] [can] be done . 
B|76| M: huh . 
A|77| A: where there's [a] will , where there's [a] will , there's [a] _way_ [, right] ?
