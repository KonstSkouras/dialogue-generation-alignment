A|3| A: [it's] an eighty-nine _and i_ _bought_ _it_ _uh_ _in_ _uh_ eighty-eight _so_ _yeah ._ 
B|4| M: [yeah] _well_ [i] _i've_ _had_ [uh]

B|28| M: _i i don't _know_ ._ [i] donno _i think_ [it's] _probably_ _i mean_ [i] _i've_ _had_ _i had_ _a_ _a_ couple _of_ cars [and] [uh] _i think_ _one_ _of_ them _was_ _a_ ninety-one _ford_ taurus . 
A|29| A: _is_ [that] how [you] [i] [have] _never_ 
B|30| M: uh-uh . [i] [never] [really] thought about [it] [that] way . _i mean_ _i _i_ would_ [i] _probably_ _would_ [buy] _a_ new _car_ every two years . 
A|31| A: its 
B|32| M: _and the_ [uh] 
A|33| A: isn't [that] [a] shame . 
B|34| M: _i don't _know_ ._ _i i don't_ [i _just] don't_ _think_ there's [a] quality difference between [the] two . 
A|35| A: _my_ word isn't [that] sorry . _that's_ sorry . 
B|36| M: _i mean_ [it] [it] [just] [it] handled [like] [a] truck [you] couldn't [really] push [it .] [it] _was_ [just] 
A|37| A: _my_ word . 
B|38| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|39| A: _oh_ mercy . 
B|40| M: _i don't know_ _if_ _you're_ familiar _with_ [that] [but] 
A|41| A: [you] 
B|42| M: _well_ [my] husband _had_ [a] volvo [and _i] had_ [a] honda 
A|43| A: huh . 
B|44| M: [and] [uh] _so that's_ [the] first _car _i_ ever_ [bought] new . 
A|45| A: huh . 
B|46| M: [and] [it] _was_ [uh] [it] _was_ not [a] very good _one_ at _all_ . 
A|47| A: huh . _uh-huh ._ 
B|48| M: [but] [uh] [it's] [a] hard question [really] . _i mean_ _i i don't [know_ _i] guess_ [i] [it] [just] [seems like] there's [so] many cars [that] _i think_ _are_ [really] going _to go_ out _of_ style . 
A|49| A: _sure ._ 
B|50| M: [it] _was_ not [uh] _i i don't [know_ _i] guess_ [it's] because [it] _was_ [a] big [uh] _large_ company _i mean_ [you] _didn't_ _see_ _a lot of_ [uh] _you know_ [you] couldn't _see_ [too] many people [that] worked _for_ [a] big company . 
A|51| A: _no_ thanks . [that's] _right ._ 
B|52| M: [so] [i] i'm not [really] [sure] _what_ [the] solution [to] [that] [is] . 
A|53| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|54| M: [i just] _i i_ felt [like] [uh] . 
A|55| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|56| M: [and _i] think_ _one_ _of_ them _was_ [a] seventy-six buick _and the_ other _one_ _was_ [a] eighty-seven . 
A|57| A: wow . 
B|58| M: [and] [uh] there _was_ [no] 
A|59| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|60| M: [and] [so] we _had_ [to] we _had_ [a] [a] we [bought] [a] _uh a_ used used [uh] c _r_ x . [it] _was_ [a] [it] _was_ [a] seventy-seven . 
A|61| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|62| M: [but] [it] _was_ [a] [much] better _car_ than _what_ we _got_ . 
A|63| A: _who_ makes [that] [car] ? 
B|64| M: [uh] [it's] [a] [it] _was_ [a] demo . [it] _was_ demo'd at _a ford_ dealership . 
A|65| A: [i mean] [but] where [are] _they_ where [are] _they_ [what] [what] [is] their location [is] [it] [uh] asian [or] [is] [it] european [or] _who_ 
B|66| M: _um_ [it's] [it] [it] _was_ built _by_ [the] same people [who] built [the] toyota camry . 
A|67| A: _oh_ [it] [is] japanese . 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: _okay_ 
B|70| M: [yeah] [and _i] _i_ think i_ 
A|71| A: [i] [didn't] [know .] 
B|72| M: [yeah] [they] _had_ [a] [uh] [they] [they] _put_ out [a] [a] paper release _on_ [uh] _on_ _on_ _you know_ recycling _of_ plastic [uh] magazines . 
A|73| A: [uh-huh .] _okay_ 
B|74| M: [but] [uh] 
A|75| A: _yeah [i_ guess] [so _that's] true ._ [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|77| A: [if] [if] [if] [i had] _the [car_ i] [wanted] . 
B|78| M: uh-uh . 
A|79| A: gee . 
B|80| M: why not [just] pay [the car] insurance [and] [and] [uh] [that] _would_ be [the] easy way . 
A|81| A: [probably] [um] [uh] let's [see] _i _like_ the_ looks _of the_ lincoln town [car] 
B|82| M: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: [but] [i i don't know] [the] performance _of it ._ [that's] [a ford] product 
B|84| M: [yeah .] 
A|85| A: [and] [you [know] [i] would] get hung up [by] [my] boot straps [if] [i] [if] [i ever] mentioned [the] [ford] product [in] [my] family . 
B|86| M: [right .] 
A|87| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|88| M: [and] [uh] [you] [would] _think_ [that] [they] [would] make quality products .
