B|18| M: [uh] _well [i_ was] [i] [had] [not] _heard_ _that ._

A|21| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|22| M: [i think] [they] _just_ [got] [it] _out ._ 
A|23| A: [i know] florida has [it .] 
B|24| M: no . 
A|25| A: _uh-huh ._ [yeah .] 
B|26| M: [but uh] . 
A|27| A: [uh you know] 
B|28| M: [yeah .] 
A|29| A: [yeah .] [but] [it's] funny _that [uh_ [i] mean] [like] [you know like] [i] said [i think] last _year_ [was] [the] first _time_ [in] [like] eighteen years [for] [pennsylvania] . [i'm not] even [sure] [of] [that] [but] [for] [some] reason _i think [that_ you know] [it] [was] something [like] [that .] [and] [it] surprised [and] even florida [i know] _they have_ _it _and_ [you_ don't] really _hear_ _about_ [it] real often [how] many _people_ 
B|30| M: uh-uh . 
A|31| A: [yeah] _but [you_ you] [think that] [i mean] [if] [you] [think] [of] [how] many premeditated murders [are] committed [you know] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] [how] many _people_ [are] being sent [that] doesn't seem [like] _very_ many . 
B|32| M: _well i_ [i] _i think you_ _can_ _see_ [it] _in the_ _in the_ society [uh] . 
A|33| A: [yeah .] 
B|34| M: [but you] don t [have] [to] [be] convicted [of] [a] certain crime [and _you] can't_ [be] [you] _can be_ sentenced [to death] [but you] _can_ _only_ [be] sentenced once . 
A|35| A: everyone [would] appeal _. that's true_ [too] .

A|39| A: _uh-huh ._ [yeah .] 
B|40| M: _and then they_ [they _have] a_ waiting period _and [they_ have] [all] [the] information [you] _can_ find _out_ [about] your license [and] everything . 
A|41| A: [yeah] _uh-huh ._ 
B|42| M: [so] [you] _see_ [a] lot [of] [a] lot more men [a] [a] lot [uh] _in the_ media [and] [and] [uh] . 
A|43| A: [and then they] _get_ [out .] 
B|44| M: [and] _and they_ [and] [and then] [you] _see_ _them _in_ the_ headlines [you] _never_ _know who_ _they're_ [you [don't] _know] who_ [to] [believe] _them ._ 
A|45| A: [yeah] [they] _get_ [out] [in] three years _on_ probation 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and they] [do] [it] again _you know ._ 
B|48| M: [well] [that's true] [. that's true] _that is_ [true] . 
A|49| A: [it's] [like] [a] slap _on_ [the] fingers [for] [them .] 
B|50| M: _yeah yeah_ [i mean] _it's just [i don't_ [know] [.] i] donno . 
A|51| A: [i don't [i] don't [i] don't _i] think that_ [it] _should be_ [i mean] [if] [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] someone [did] premeditate someone [a] murder [then] [i think [you] [know] that] [they] _should_ likewise [you know] someone _should_ take their life _also_ . [but uh] [but] [are] _are [you_ would] [you] draw [the] [line] [there] [with] [just] [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|52| M: [uh i] [i would] _probably_ [say] yes [. i think] [there] [should be] [some] controls _against [it_ and] [uh i] [and] [i] [there] [should] [also] [be] [some] control _against it_ [if] [it] [if] [it] does happen [. [uh] i] [also] [think that] [there] [should] _definitely_ [be] [some] penalties [for] [people] _who_ commit certain crimes such [as] rape [uh] 
A|53| A: [yeah .] 
B|54| M: because [i think] [the] _way_ [the] trial by jury [was] set up [was] [to] make [sure] [that uh] [that [that] [you] you] knew [that] yes [you're] _guilty_ [you] _can be_ you've been charged [with] [a] crime [and _you] can't_ [you don't] [have] [to] give up your right [to] continue living [with] your crime . 
A|55| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|56| M: [but uh] . 
A|57| A: [yeah .] 
B|58| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|59| A: _uh-huh ._ [yeah .] 
B|60| M: [and] [and] [and] [i] don [i] don [think] [they have] [the] right [to] [do] [that] because [you you] [have] [to] [go] through you've [got] [to] [get] [people that] [are _you] can't_ [just] [you don't] [have] [to] [be] [the] _most_ hardened [and] [uh [you know] .] 
A|61| A: [i think] [some] [of] [them] [would] _rather_ [be] [in] jail 
B|62| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [yeah .] [they] [probably] [have] [it] better [in] jail [than] [what they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: uh-uh _. well i_ guess [i don't [know] [.] i] _i you know_ _i've_ [i] _have a_ [hard] [time] [thinking [that] [uh] [you know] it's] [a] [it's not] [a] problem anymore [it] [it] seems [like] [there's] been [a] lot [of] _you can't_ [say that] [it's] [it] [just] hasn't been [a] problem [for] [a] [very] long [time] . 
A|65| A: [i don't know] [uh [i] was just] _going to_ [say] something [i] forgot [what] [it] [was] . [oh] [i don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] [now] . 
B|66| M: [oh] _okay_ . 
A|67| A: [in] clarion [. well i] live [in] butler [but] [i'm] at [i'm] at college . [i'm] at clarion university . 
B|68| M: [oh] _okay_ . 
A|69| A: [yeah] 
B|70| M: _okay_ . 
A|71| A: _uh-huh ._ [see] [yeah] [okay] [well] [see] [i'm] _i'm in_ [kind] _i'm in_ [kind] [okay] [uh] [we] [only] [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|72| M: [uh] [okay] 
A|73| A: [yeah] [and] [that] [would] [be] pushing [it .] [so [i] mean] [this] [is] [definitely] [a] college town [. uh] we're [about] _two_ hours north [of] pittsburgh [if] [that] [would] help [you] [out] any [. uh] 
B|74| M: [yeah .] 
A|75| A: north [of] pittsburgh [pennsylvania] . 
B|76| M: [okay] . 
A|77| A: [oh] [i've] [never] [heard of] polk [but] 
B|78| M: [okay] [i'm in] garland . 
A|79| A: [oh] [i] [never] [heard of] [that .]

A|85| A: we're [probably] [about] an hour away from sharon . 
B|86| M: [okay] . 
A|87| A: [uh-huh [.] uh] [so i] [most] [of] [the] kids here [i [you know] like] [you know] [just] from dorm mates [and] stuff they'll [say that] [they] [don't] [believe] [in] [it] [but] [then] after [i would] [say] [my] point [of] view [then] they'll [say] [well] [yeah] [you know] [you know .] 
B|88| M: right . 
A|89| A: [yeah .] [you [know] [i] think] [people] [can be] persuaded [one] [way] _or_ another . [i've] [never] seriously ran into someone [i mean] [like] other [than] [my] priest [you [know] who] [definitely] says [you can't] take [a] [you know] [you can't] take anyone's life [. uh] anyone [that is] [like] [so] [against it] [that you] couldn't persuade [them in] any instance . 
B|90| M: right . 
A|91| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|92| M: [but [you] don't] [hear] [you [you] hear] stories [about] [people that] [are] [you're] [sure] _they're guilty_ . 
A|93| A: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [and] [and] [and] [i think [you] you] [have] [to] [have] [the] [you] need [to] [have] [some] background [on] [it [you know] .] 
A|95| A: [yeah] 
B|96| M: [so i] [i think [that] that] [there's] [there] [there] [is] [a] [a] double standard [in] [in the] courts . 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [yeah [.] that's] something [you know] [but uh] whether [they] plea bargain _or_ [not] [if] [they're guilty] [of] murder [they're guilty] [of] murder [you know .] 
B|98| M: [well [i] mean] [the] guy's [you're] right he's [not] [going to] [get] off [the] street [for] [a] [year] [or] [two] . 
A|99| A: [so [i] don't] [think that] [they] deserve anything less 
B|100| M: no [that] seems [rather] shortsighted . 
A|101| A: [it's just [i don't] [i] don't know i] [just] 
B|102| M: [i think [that] uh] . 
A|103| A: [uh-huh] [and] [that] costs money [yeah .] 
B|104| M: [and] 
A|105| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [but [uh] i'm not sure] [that [that] [we] have] [the] right solution [to] [it .] 
A|107| A: [yeah .]
