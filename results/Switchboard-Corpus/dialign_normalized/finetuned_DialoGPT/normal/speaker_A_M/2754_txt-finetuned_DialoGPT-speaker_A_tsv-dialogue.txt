B|30| M: uh-uh . 
A|31| A: _yeah [,_ _but] [, you_ , you] [think that [,] i mean] [if] [you] [think] [of] [how] many premeditated murders [are] committed [, you know ,] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] [how] many _people_ [are] being sent [, that] doesn't seem [like] _very_ many . 
B|32| M: [well] [i [,] i _,] _i think_ , you_ _can_ _see_ [it] _in the_ , _in the_ society [, uh] . 
A|33| A: [yeah .] 
B|34| M: [but , you] don t [have] [to] [be] convicted [of] [a] certain crime [and _you] can't_ _be [,_ you] _can be_ sentenced [to death] [, but] [you] _can_ _only_ [be] sentenced once .

A|39| A: _uh-huh ._ [yeah .] 
B|40| M: _and then they_ [, [they] _have] a_ waiting period [, _and] [they_ have] [all] [the] information [, you] _can_ find _out_ [about] your license [and] everything . 
A|41| A: _yeah ,_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|42| M: [so [,] you] _see_ [a] lot [of] _, a_ lot more men _, a_ [a] lot [, uh] _in the_ media [and [,] [and] [,] uh] . 
A|43| A: [and then they] _get_ [out .]

A|45| A: _yeah [,_ they] _get_ [out] [in] three years _on_ probation , 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and they] [do] [it] again _, you know ._ 
B|48| M: [well ,] [that's true] [. that's true [,] _that] is_ [true] . 
A|49| A: [it's] [like] [a] slap _on_ [the] fingers [for] [them .] 
B|50| M: _yeah _, yeah_ [,_ i mean [,] _it's] just [, i don't_ [know] [.] i] donno . 
A|51| A: [i don't [, i] don't [, i] don't _, i] think that_ [it] _should [be_ [,] i mean] [if] [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] someone [did] premeditate someone [, a] murder , [then] [i think [, you] know [,] that] [they] _should_ likewise [, you know ,] someone _should_ take their life _also_ . _but , uh [,_ [but] ,] _are ,_ [are] [you ,] [would] [you] draw [the] [line] [there] [with] [just] [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|52| M: [uh , i [,] i would] _probably_ [say] yes [. i think] [there] [should be] [some] controls _against [it_ , [and] [,] uh] [i [,] and] [i ,] [there] [should] [also] [be] [some] control _against it_ [if] [it [,] if] [it] does happen [. [uh ,] i] [also] [think that] [there] [should] _definitely_ [be] [some] penalties [for] [people] _who_ commit certain crimes , such [as] rape [, uh] 
A|53| A: [yeah .] 
B|54| M: because [i think] [the] _way_ [the] trial by jury [was] set up [was] [to] make [sure] [that , uh] [that , [that] [, you] , you] knew [that ,] yes , [you're] _guilty_ [, you] _can [be_ ,] you've been charged [with] [a] crime [, and _you] can't_ [, [you] don't] [have] [to] give up your right [to] continue living [with] your crime .

B|60| M: [and [,] [and] [,] and] [i] don [, i] don [think] [they have] [the] right [to] [do] [that ,] because [, you , you] [have] [to] [go] through , you've [got] [to] [get] [people that] [are _,] you can't_ _just [,_ [you] don't] [have] [to] [be] [the] _most_ hardened [and [,] uh] [you know .] 
A|61| A: [i think] [some] [of] [them] [would] _rather_ [be] [in] jail 
B|62| M: [uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [yeah .] [they] [probably] [have] [it] better [in] jail [than] [what they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: uh-uh _. well , i_ guess [, i don't [know] [.] [i] _,] i , you know _,_ i've_ [, i] _have a_ [hard] [time] [thinking [that] , uh] [you know] [it's] _a [,_ it's not] [a] problem anymore [, [it] [,] it] seems [like] [there's] been [a] lot [of] _, you can't_ [say that] [it's [,] it] [just] hasn't been [a] problem [for] [a] [very] long [time] . 
A|65| A: [i don't know [,] [uh [,] i] was just] _going to_ [say] something [, i] forgot [what] [it] [was] . _oh [,_ i don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] [now] .

B|88| M: right . 
A|89| A: [yeah .] [you [know [,] i] think] [people] [can be] persuaded [one] [way] _or_ another . [i've] [never] seriously ran into someone [, i mean] [like] , other [than] [my] priest [, you know ,] [who] [definitely] says [you can't] take [a [,] you know [,] you can't] take anyone's life [. uh ,] anyone [that is] [like] [so] [against it] [that you] couldn't persuade [them in] any instance . 
B|90| M: right . 
A|91| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|92| M: [but , [you] don't] [hear] [, you [, you] hear] stories [about] [people that] [are ,] [you're] [sure] _they're guilty_ . 
A|93| A: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [and [,] [and] [,] and] [i think [, you] , you] [have] [to] [have] [the] [, you] need [to] [have] [some] background [on] [it [, you know] .] 
A|95| A: [yeah ,] 
B|96| M: [so , i [,] [i think [that] ,] that] [there's] , [there] , [there] [is] [a [,] a] double standard [in] , [in the] courts . 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [yeah [.] that's] something [, you know] _but , uh ,_ whether [they] plea bargain _or_ [not] [, if] [they're guilty] [of] murder , [they're guilty] [of] murder [, you know .] 
B|98| M: [well [, i] mean ,] [the] guy's , [you're] right , he's [not] [going to] [get] off [the] street [for] [a] [year] [or] [two] . 
A|99| A: [so [i] don't] [think that] [they] deserve anything less 
B|100| M: no [, that] seems [rather] shortsighted . 
A|101| A: [it's just [, i don't] [, [i] don't know] , i] [just] 
B|102| M: [i think [that ,] uh] . 
A|103| A: [uh-huh] [, and] [that] costs money [, yeah .]
