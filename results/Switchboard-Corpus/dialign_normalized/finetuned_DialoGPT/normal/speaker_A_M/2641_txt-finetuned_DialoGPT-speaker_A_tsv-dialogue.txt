B|16| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|17| A: _so_ [you know] _they're not_ you're _not_ worried _about_ _them_ running all-around _the_ neighborhood [and] [you know] _they_ [you know] _they they_ make their mess _in _the_ cat_ _pan_ which _is_ 
B|18| M: [yeah .] 
A|19| A: [yeah] [it's] [you know] [it's] [a] pain _to_ clean _but_ [you know we] _used to_ [i] mean _they_ _got_ great stuff [out] _now_ _for_ cleaning cats' pans . _they_ didn't 
B|20| M: _no_ [i] [i'm not] sure _if_ [i] would consider [that] [a] hobby . 
A|21| A: [well] when _i was_ [you know] when _i was_ growing _up_ [i] _had a_ clean _the cat_ _pan_ _all the_ time [and i] hated [it] _because_ [i] _had to_ carry everything upstairs [and] [you know] [and] use this _thing_ _to_ [you know] scoop _the_ take _the_ stuff [out and] _put_ [it] _in the_ toilet [and] everything _it was_ [really] terrible . _but_ _now_ _they have_ _like_ this [you] _get_ _these_ liners _that is_ garbage bags [you know] 
B|22| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|23| A: [and] [you] [and] _you [you_ know] _the_ 
B|24| M: _and the_ _and the_ _people_ [and] [it's just] [it] [you don't] _even_ _know what_ _it is_ [you] [just] [you] [have to] [wonder] _if_ [it's] some sort _of_ [uh] some sort uh-hive [uh] [uh] _uh you know_ [for] [for] [uh] 
A|25| A: [yeah] [the] _cats_ _do_ [it] _in_ _there_ [you] pull [it] [and] take [it] [out and] throw [it] away [and] _that's_ [it] 
B|26| M: _i've_ [got] [a] _i've_ [got] two [cats] [now] _and _they're_ both_ [about] [the same] age . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [and] _we [had_ a] _a cat_ [um] _who_ [was] [uh] [about] eight _years_ old _and she_ would sleep [in the] back _of_ [the] [house] _with_ us 
A|29| A: [same] idea 
B|30| M: [uh] _and it [was_ [a] lot] _of_ _fun_ _but [i_ was] also trying [to] figure [out] [you know] _how_ [to] [get] rid _of_ _the the_ [uh] sticky buns [and] _and the_ [and] [all the] little things [that] [that] [we] [have to] peel _for the_ [to] open [the] _can_ . 
A|31| A: everyday ? 
B|32| M: _and it was_ [it [was] a] very dirty [pan] 
A|33| A: _oh okay_ [i] see . 
B|34| M: [and] [so _i] guess_ _i _i_ think_ [that's] [the] only [thing] [i] _can_ [really] complain [about] [about] [is] [uh] [the] service charge _. _i_ don't _know_ if_ [it's just] [a] part _of_ _it but_ [uh] 
A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [and it] would [have] killed [the cat] _but it was_ [so] worth [it .] 
A|37| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|38| M: [so] _she's_ _she_ [has a] [real] fear [about] cucumbers cucumbers [because] _she_ says [that] _they're just_ too hard _she_ doesn't want [to] eat [them .] 
A|39| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|40| M: [and] [so] _she_ [has] [put] [in] [a lot] _of_ _work and_ [and] he's _been_ _an_ excellent [dog .] 
A|41| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|42| M: [so] 
A|43| A: [so] _you don't have_ anything _right now_ ? 
B|44| M: _no_ [not] [right now] . 
A|45| A: [oh] except [the] kid huh [that's] 
B|46| M: [yeah] _so ._ 
A|47| A: _uh i don't_ [i don't know] [because] [the] [cats] _pretty_ _much_ [um] [yeah] [we] [can] leave [them] [for] [a] weekend _as_ _long_ _as_ [we] [put] plenty [of] food [out] 
B|48| M: _oh ._ 
A|49| A: _and um_ [uh] [it's] [not] [a] _big_ deal [really] [i] mean _they're they're_ happier when we're _around_ [but] [you know] _they_ [they're] _pretty_ _much_ _okay_ by themselves [um] [and [i] don't] [you know _we] couldn't_ _do that_ [with] [a [dog] .] 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: _well that's_ [that's] [um] pampering [the the] petals 
B|52| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|53| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and] then [you you] [had _to] go_ [out and] mow [the] grass 
A|55| A: _but they're not_ [that] _much_ [fun] [you know] _you can't_ take [them] [for] [a] walk _you can't_ [you know] _they they_ [don't] _they_ _can't_ fetch [you know] 
B|56| M: [yeah .] 
A|57| A: _they they_ _can't do_ anything [so] [i've] never [i think] [we had] fish when [i [was] a] kid [but [i] don't] 
B|58| M: [oh] [i've] heard _of [them_ .] 
A|59| A: [oh .] 
B|60| M: _and [it was_ like] [it was] [about] eleven _or_ twelve feet [long] [and] [he] jumped [out and] jumped [right] _into_ [it .] 
A|61| A: [oh .] 
B|62| M: _and it [was_ a] [it was] _it it_ looked [like] _it was the same_ color [as] [the] _one_ [that] [my] mother made . 
A|63| A: [oh .] 
B|64| M: [but] [um] . 
A|65| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [so] [we] [just] took our [dog] [in] [and] [he] [was] [just] [it was] [just] too [much] . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [and] [we [had] to] [get] rid [of] [all] [of] [the] barns [that] [were] _there _and_ the_ barn [was] empty [and] [we couldn't] [get] [out] _there and_ [we were] trying [to] [get] [out] [the the] [uh] [the] drag net [out and] [we] tried [to] [get] back [out _and] the_ [and] then [we] couldn tinker [with] [that] [and] [we] ended [up] [having] [to] [get] [all the] drag [out] [of] [the] dragnet [and] [that] [was] [that] [was a] [that's] [a] part [of] [the] problem [you know [we] had] [all the] barn space [in the] [house] [but [we] had] _no_ room [for] dragnet . 
A|69| A: [no it's] [like] [i] [just] [i don't know i i] [just] never understood why [what] [the] attraction [i] mean [they're] [you know] [they're] _pretty_ [and] everything [but] [i've] [just] never seen [the] attraction [of] [having] fish . [it's] [not] [as] [much] [fun] . 
B|70| M: [well] [they [they] [have] to] [be] [they] [just] [have to] [get] [used to] each _other_ _i guess_ . 
A|71| A: [an] eel ? 
B|72| M: [an] elk . 
A|73| A: [oh] [now] [we] [really] [get] sick 
B|74| M: [yeah] [but they're not] too _bad_ . 
A|75| A: [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [but] [uh] we've [had] some [pretty] [nice] weather down [there] . 
A|77| A: [like] [i] _remember_ [a friend] [of] mine at [work] telling me [that] at his frat [in] college [that] [they] [had a] tank [of] piranha [and [uh] you know] [used to] drop mice [in] 
B|78| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: this [is] [not] _these_ aren't [cats] [you know] 
B|80| M: [oh] [really] .

B|82| M: [i] _know ._ 
A|83| A: yep . 
B|84| M: [i don't _know] ._ 
A|85| A: _yeah well_ 
B|86| M: [but] [uh [i don't] know [i] think] [uh] . 
A|87| A: _yeah well_ [a cat] will _do_ [the same] trick 
B|88| M: [yeah .] 
A|89| A: [i] [had [a] friend] [in] [i] [had [a] friend] [in] college [who] [had a] [um] [had a] _pet_ rat [for] [a] while . 
B|90| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|91| A: [um] [i] forget [how] [she] [got] [it [but] it was] [um] [it was the same] kind [of] [a] deal [i think] [she] [got] [it] [i think] _she was a_ psych major [and she] [got] [it] from [the] psych department . 
B|92| M: [oh] [really] . 
A|93| A: whoops 
B|94| M: [so i] don [know] [but _i] guess_ [i i] [my] [pet] peeve [with] magazines [is] [i] find [them] [to] [be] very formula oriented [and [i] think] [that's] _one of_ [the] reasons [that] they've gone downhill _the last_ _few years_ [but [they're] they're] [still] [around] 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [and i] said [well] [you [can't] [do] that] [i'm] sorry . 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [but] [um] . 
A|99| A: [uh-huh .] [oh] [yeah] [i] mean [you [know] if] [you] [get] [them] young [and] everything before [they] [go] kind [of] nuts [so .] 
B|100| M: [well] [i [i] think] [i'm not] sure [how] [much] [of] [that is] [uh [you] you] [have to] [do] [with] [the the] social changes [that] [have] occurred [uh] . 
A|101| A: [yeah] rats _are_ [not] [my] favorite animals [in the] world [but i] could see getting [one] from birth [and] everything . 
B|102| M: [well] [we] [we] [have] [a dog] [now] [and] [we] [uh] [we] found _her_ [about] [a] year [ago [and] uh] [we] took _her_ home [and she] [had] picked [up] [a] ham _and [it was_ the] strangest [thing] [she was a] hamster . 
A|103| A: [yeah .] 
B|104| M: [and] 
A|105| A: [yeah] [i [i] i have] friends [with] hamsters [and] gerbils [and] [they they] tell me [the same] [thing] . 
B|106| M: [well] [they] 
A|107| A: [i] [just] again [it] gets [into] vivant [much] [fun] [you [know] what] [i guess] [they] [can] [be] [. i]

A|109| A: _okay ._ 
B|110| M: [and um] . 
A|111| A: [right] .

A|113| A: [oh] [people]
