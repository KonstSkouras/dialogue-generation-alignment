A|3| A: because _i don't_ _like_ _credit cards_ _for_ _one_ thing _, you know _,_ i mean ,_ _they're_ _okay_ _, i guess ,_ _if_ _you're_ on _a_ trip _or_ something _, you don't have to_ take _a_ whole bunch _of_ _, you know ,_ cash _with _you_ ,_ 
B|4| M: _uh ,_ no .

B|12| M: _so [,_ _i mean [,] i_ guess [,] _i] just _don't_ _know_ _._ _i_ _,_ i'm not_ [too] much _of a_ _person_ _that _,_ uh _, i_ _,_ uh_ [i] don tinker [with] [credit cards] [or] _anything_ . 
A|13| A: _right ._ are _you_ married ? 
B|14| M: no _, i'm not_ . 
A|15| A: _oh , okay ._ _well [,_ _i] know_ [that] _a lot_ [of] young people _, you know [,_ i _,] it_ took _me_ [a] long time _to_ _get_ _it_ through _my_ child's head [, i mean _,] that_ was her goal _, you know [,_ uh ,] _got to have a_ [credit] card , 
B|16| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|17| A: _but_ now [that] she has _one_ , she's only used _it_ _one_ time _but_ she wanted _to_ establish some [credit] , 
B|18| M: [right .] 
A|19| A: _but_ [i] think _it_ finally sunk in _, you know ,_ because she saw some [of] _the_ other people _and_ [just] _like_ she heard _them_ say _, you know _,_ _well_ [,_ i] used [a] [credit] card _. and_ _my_ husband's sister _is_ _the_ world's worst at , [oh _,] _well_ ,_ _i'll_ [just] use _the_ [credit cards] _and_ she has all [of] her [credit cards] up _to_ _the_ limit . 
B|20| M: [uh ,] 
A|21| A: _you know _,_ _and_ i'm_ [, i'm] thinking woman , wake up _and_ smell _the_ roses before _they_ come _and_ _get_ _you ._ _but_ ... 
B|22| M: [yeah [,] i] agree [with you] there . 
A|23| A: [right] _, and_ people [don't] see [that] either . 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|25| A: [right .] _the_ only _one_ [that] we , we _have_ [that] we kept was _the_ discover card , 
B|26| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: _and_ _it_ pays [you] _to_ use _it [._ [i] mean ,] _if you_ _pay_ your _bill_ off [right] away , _if _you_ don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ any interest on _it_ because _they_ give [you] [a] certain _amount_ _every_ time [that] [you] use _it ,_ 
B|28| M: [oh _,] that's_ good . 
A|29| A: _and_ [you] _make that_ _money_ as long as _you don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ _them_ any [, uh ,] interest . now _it's_ _, and_ people say _, _well_ _,_ you _know ,_ i'm_ making _money_ by using this [credit] card _, but_ _they_ [don't] realize [that] _if_ _they_ [, i mean _,] it_ only takes _one_ time _for_ [you] _to_ use _it and_ [not] _pay_ _the_ interest [, i mean _,] you have to_ _pay_ _the_ interest , [not] _pay_ _it_ [right] off , 
B|30| M: [right .] 
A|31| A: [that's] _going to_ take up _what_ [you] would _have_ made . 
B|32| M: _yeah ._ 
A|33| A: [so] [that's] _the_ only reason [that] we kept [that ,] we debated _for_ [a] long time plus _they_ _don't have_ [that _,] um_ , _charge_ on _it _,_ you know ,_ _like_ ... 
B|34| M: [well ,] [i've] never [, i] haven't [, i] never _, it's_ _always_ _been_ [like] [my] mom _always_ says [, well] [if you] [charge] [it [,] it] will _be_ automatically undoed , _so ,_ 
A|35| A: [yeah .] 
B|36| M: [oh , okay .] 
A|37| A: [right .] _they_ _don't have_ _one_ [of] those . [so [,] [it] ,] we decided [that] was [it _,] you know _,_ and [,_ i mean ,] everybody calls us _and_ wants _to_ give us [a] [credit] card . we _have_ , we could _have_ [credit cards] running down our ears . 
B|38| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|39| A: yes , yes _. _and_ then ,_ _i'll have_ , [just] _like [,_ uh ,] department stores . they'll call [me] up _, you know _,_ and_ _i'll_ say , look _, i don't_ want _the_ [credit] card [, [well] ,] we're [just] _going to_ _send it_ _to _you_ _, you_ know _,_ you don't have to_ ever use [it] [if _you] don't_ want _to_ . they'll _send_ [me] any [credit] card [, i] tear [it] up [. [i] just] can't see _it ._ 
B|40| M: _yeah . [i_ _know] ._ 
A|41| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|42| M: [and then] [you have to] write [a] _check_ [for _it _.] and_ i just_ hate [them] . 
A|43| A: [i know] [it _,] and_ _you _know_ what_ ... 
B|44| M: [and then] [they] [send it] _back_ [to [you] .] 
A|45| A: what's really [bad] about those though _is_ [just] [like] young people [if] [they] [don't] _, you know ,_ we take _the_ time _to _, you_ know ,_ help [my] daughter , she's in college , 
B|46| M: uh-uh . 
A|47| A: _but_ [it ,] this _is_ her first [credit] card thing [, [well] ,] when she _got_ her first _one_ she was [so] excited [it] was unreal . look at this [they] sent [me] this _money _,_ you [know_ .] [so] [then] when [i] explained [to] her , look [you have to] _pay_ this _back and_ [they] are _going to_ [charge] [you] interest _, and_ stuff , [of] course , she tore [it] up . _but_ _a lot_ [of] parents would [not] take _the_ time _, you know _,_ and_ [they] wouldn't _even_ think [of] [it] [or] their kids may [not] [be] as close as [my] daughter [and i] are _, and [,_ uh _,] you know ,_ [they] may [not] _even_ discuss [it ,] [they] _go_ out [and] cash their [check] thinking _that _, you_ know ,_ they've _got_ something , maybe they've won something . _you know ,_ somebody sent [them] something free . 
B|48| M: [uh ,] [i've] _had_ _, i have_ _had_ [a] couple [of] _credit cards [,_ and] [i've] [, [you] , you] [get] [one] [or] two bucks [for] [every] dollar [you] _spend_ [, [and] then] [you] [get] [, uh] [a lot] _more_ [for] [the] [amount] [you] _spend_ . 
A|49| A: [and] _go_ out [and] [spend] [it . _and] , um_ [, it's] [just] unreal [. _i] mean , i don't_ [like] [credit cards [,] i] wish [that] [they] would come up [with] some other way _to _, you_ know ,_ [the] only way [you] could use [them] _is_ [if you] were , [like] on vacation . [they] would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] _year_ . _you know [,_ i mean ,] [of] course [, i guess] some people _go_ out [and] [spend] their whole entire limit on [it] [like] [that] at [that] time _but _,_ um_ [, i have] seen [so] many people [and [i] _have] a_ friend [right] now she [just] _got_ off [of] thirteen . she _got_ [, uh , i] can't remember _what_ she called [it [,] it's] some kind [of] , maybe [it's] _sure_ [or] something [like] [that [,] it's] something [, it's] some weird name [of a] [credit] card , 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [and] she _is_ _charging_ out [of] her mind already _. and i'm_ _going_ [, you] [just] _got_ off . [that's] _how_ [you] _got_ on [to] [it] [to] start [with] _, you know ,_ _what_ _is_ [the] matter [with] this [person] , 
B|52| M: [yeah .] 
A|53| A: _but _,_ um_ [, it] seems [like] people [just] _, you know ,_ [they] [just] think [, [well] [,] _i] can_ [just] [have] [anything] [i] want [. and [i just] don't] see [it] [like] [that .] [of] course [, i] [always] see _pay_ [the] bills first [and] whatever's leftover [, that's] _what_ [you have] _, but _,_ um_ , maybe [a lot] [of] people [don't] see [it] [like] [that _,] but_ [i] can't stand owing [. [i] mean , i] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe something _like _,_ you know [,_ i guess] [it's] [just] because [i've] [been] brought up [like] [that .] _but _,_ um_ [, i] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that] [i] was _going to have to_ _pay_ this thing out [for] ever [and] maybe suffer from having [to] payout . _but [,_ that's] [just] [the] way [i] feel about [it .] 
B|54| M: [yeah _, yeah] ._ 
A|55| A: [right .] [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [and [,] you] don tinker [with] [it [and] [i] can] [always] tell [my] husband [, [you] ,] you've [got to have a] budget [and [,] [and ,] um] . 
A|57| A: [oh [,] [yeah .] [i] guess] [it] _is_ [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] [more] [and] [more] people are [like] [that .] _but [,_ um] [, i guess] [it's] because [i'm] older [, i mean [,] i'm not] real old _but_ [i] am older [and , um] _, you know [,_ i] didn't feel [like] [that] [i] didn't feel [like] [i] [had] [to have] everything [. [i] guess] [it] was because [, [well] [,] i] [had] everything when [i] was at home _but_ [i _,] _i don't_ know_ why [i] didn't . 
B|58| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [and i'm] [like [,] well] [then] [i'll [have] to] [make [that] [.] and i'm] [sure] [that , [you] ,] [you're] [not] [going to have [to] [, you] have to] [be] [, you don't have to] [spend] [that] much [money ,] 
A|61| A: [yeah .] 
B|62| M: [and then [,] you] [can] [go] [back and] [pay for it] again . 
A|63| A: huh . 
B|64| M: [so [,] you know [,] that's] [, [that] [,] that] [is] [a] big problem . 
A|65| A: [yeah [,] [well] [,] it] didn't hurt [you ,] did [it ,] [to [,] i mean [,] you] didn't [go] out [and] [charge] [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything , did [you] ? 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [yeah [,] [well] [,] you] learned [then ,] [right] ? 
B|68| M: [yeah .] 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [you know [,] that's] [not] , [you're] [, uh] 
A|71| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [i don't [know] [, i'm] not] [sure] [how] much [they're] [charging] per [year] per [year] [, but [,] [i mean ,] i don't] [even] [know] [if] [i [know] what] [my] total [bill] [is] per [year] [or] per month [or] [how] much [i'm] actually supposed [to] [be] getting paid [for it .]
