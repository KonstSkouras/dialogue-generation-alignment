B|0| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|1| A: _and_ we only _have_ _one_ . we tore all _the_ rest _of_ _them_ up . 
B|2| M: _oh_ _that's_ _not_ _bad_ . 
A|3| A: because _i don't_ _like_ _credit cards_ _for_ _one_ thing _you know_ _i mean_ _they're_ _okay_ _i guess_ _if_ _you're_ on _a_ trip _or_ something _you don't have to_ take _a_ whole bunch _of_ _you know_ cash _with you_ 
B|4| M: _uh_ no . 
A|5| A: _but _i_ don't_ _like_ using _them_ because _i've_ seen _too_ many people _that_ used _them_ _and_ ended up bankrupt _or_ on chapter thirteen _and_ stuff _like_ _that ._ 
B|6| M: _yeah ._ 
A|7| A: because _they_ _have_ this weird opinion _that_ _if you_ use _that_ card _you don't have to_ _pay _for it_ ._ 
B|8| M: _yeah ._ 
A|9| A: _yeah yeah_ _and_ _it_ gives _you_ _a_ _um_ _a_ false sense _of_ security _or_ something _it_ seems _like_ because _you_ say [oh] _well_ _i _don't_ have to_ _pay for it_ now _but_ _you're_ _going to have to_ _pay for _it_ and_ _it_ seems _like_ ... 
B|10| M: _yeah ._ 
A|11| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|12| M: _so_ _i mean [i_ guess] _i just _don't_ _know_ _._ i_ _i'm not_ [too] much _of a_ _person_ [that] _uh i_ _uh i_ don tinker [with] [credit cards] [or] _anything_ . 
A|13| A: _right ._ are _you_ married ? 
B|14| M: no _i'm not_ . 
A|15| A: _oh okay ._ _well_ _i know_ [that] _a lot_ [of] young people _you know_ [i] _it_ took _me_ [a] long time _to_ _get_ _it_ through _my_ child's head [i mean] [that] was her goal _you know_ [uh] _got to have a_ [credit] card 
B|16| M: uh-uh . uh-hue . 
A|17| A: _but_ now [that] she has _one_ she's only used _it_ _one_ time _but_ she wanted _to_ establish some [credit] 
B|18| M: [right .] 
A|19| A: _but i_ think _it_ finally sunk in _you know_ because she saw some [of] _the_ other people _and_ [just] _like_ she heard _them_ say _you know_ _well_ [i] used [a] [credit] card _. and_ _my_ husband's sister _is_ _the_ world's worst at [oh] _well_ _i'll_ [just] use _the_ _credit cards and_ she has all [of] her [credit cards] up _to_ _the_ limit . 
B|20| M: [uh] 
A|21| A: _you know_ _and i'm_ [i'm] thinking woman wake up _and_ smell _the_ roses before _they_ come _and_ _get_ _you ._ _but_ ... 
B|22| M: [yeah] [i] agree [with you] there . 
A|23| A: [right] _and_ people [don't] see [that] either . 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|25| A: [right .] _the_ only _one_ [that] we we _have_ [that] we kept was _the_ discover card 
B|26| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: _and_ _it_ pays [you] _to_ use _it [._ [i] mean] _if you_ _pay_ your _bill_ off [right] away _if _you_ don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ any interest on _it_ because _they_ give [you] [a] certain _amount_ _every_ time _that you_ use _it_ 
B|28| M: [oh] _that's_ good . 
A|29| A: _and you_ _make that_ _money_ as long as _you don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ _them_ any [uh] interest . now _it's_ _and_ people say _well_ _you _know_ i'm_ making _money_ by using this [credit] card _but_ _they_ [don't] realize [that] _if_ _they_ [i mean] _it_ only takes _one_ time _for_ [you] _to_ use _it and_ [not] _pay_ _the_ interest [i mean] _you have to_ _pay_ _the_ interest [not] _pay_ _it_ [right] off 
B|30| M: [right .] 
A|31| A: [that's] _going to_ take up _what_ [you] would _have_ made . 
B|32| M: _yeah ._ 
A|33| A: [so] [that's] _the_ only reason [that] we kept [that] we debated _for_ [a] long time plus _they_ _don't have_ [that] _um_ _charge_ on _it_ _you know_ _like_ ... 
B|34| M: [well] [i've] never [i] haven't [i] never [it's] _always_ _been_ [like] [my] mom _always_ says [well] [if you] [charge] [it] [it] will _be_ automatically undoed [so] 
A|35| A: [yeah .] 
B|36| M: [oh okay .] 
A|37| A: [right .] _they_ _don't have_ _one_ [of] those . [so] [it] we decided [that] was [it] _you know_ _and [i_ mean] everybody calls us _and_ wants _to_ give us [a] [credit] card . we _have_ we could _have_ [credit cards] running down our ears . 
B|38| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|39| A: yes yes _. _and_ _then_ i'll have_ [just] [like] [uh] department stores . they'll call [me] up _you know_ _and_ _i'll_ say look _i don't_ want _the_ [credit] card [well] we're [just] _going to_ _send it_ _to _you_ _you_ know_ _you don't have to_ ever use [it] [if _you] don't_ want _to_ . they'll _send_ [me] any [credit] card [i] tear [it] up [. [i] just] can't see _it ._ 
B|40| M: _yeah . [i_ _know] ._ 
A|41| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|42| M: [and then] [you have to] write [a] _check_ [for _it _.] and_ i just_ hate [them] . 
A|43| A: [i know] _it _and_ _you_ _know_ what_ ... 
B|44| M: [and then] [they] [send it] _back_ [to [you] .] 
A|45| A: what's really [bad] about those though _is_ [just] [like] young people [if] [they] [don't] _you know_ we take _the_ time [to _you] know_ help [my] daughter she's in college 
B|46| M: uh-uh . 
A|47| A: _but_ [it] this _is_ her first [credit] card thing [well] when she _got_ her first _one_ she was [so] excited [it] was unreal . look at this [they] sent [me] this _money_ _you [know_ .] [so] [then] when [i] explained [to] her look [you have to] _pay_ this _back and_ [they] are _going to_ [charge] [you] interest [and] stuff [of] course she tore [it] up . _but_ _a lot_ [of] parents would [not] take _the_ time _you know_ [and] [they] wouldn't _even_ think [of] [it] [or] their kids may [not] [be] as close as [my] daughter [and i] are [and] [uh] _you know_ [they] may [not] _even_ discuss [it] [they] _go_ out [and] cash their [check] thinking _that _you_ know_ they've _got_ something maybe they've won something . _you know_ somebody sent [them] something free . 
B|48| M: [uh] [i've] _had_ _i have_ _had_ [a] couple [of] [credit cards and] [i've] [you you] [get] [one] [or] two bucks [for] [every] dollar [you] _spend_ [and then] [you] [get] [uh] [a lot] _more_ [for] [the] [amount] [you] _spend_ . 
A|49| A: [and] _go_ out [and] [spend] [it . _and] um_ [it's] [just] unreal [. _i] mean i don't_ [like] [credit cards] [i] wish [that] [they] would come up [with] some other way [to _you] know_ [the] only way [you] could use [them] _is_ [if you] were [like] on vacation . [they] would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] _year_ . _you know_ [i mean] [of] course [i guess] some people _go_ out [and] [spend] their whole entire limit on [it] [like] [that] at [that] time _but_ _um_ [i have] seen [so] many people [and [i] _have] a_ friend [right] now she [just] _got_ off [of] thirteen . she _got_ [uh i] can't remember _what_ she called [it] [it's] some kind [of] maybe [it's] _sure_ [or] something [like] [that] [it's] something [it's] some weird name [of a] [credit] card 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [and] she _is_ _charging_ out [of] her mind already _. and i'm_ _going_ [you] [just] _got_ off . [that's] _how_ [you] _got_ on [to] [it] [to] start [with _you] _know_ what_ _is_ [the] matter [with] this [person] 
B|52| M: [yeah .] 
A|53| A: _but_ _um_ [it] seems [like] people [just] _you know_ [they] [just] think [well] _i can_ [just] [have] [anything] [i] want [. and [i just] don't] see [it] [like] [that .] [of] course [i] [always] see _pay_ [the] bills first [and] whatever's leftover [that's] _what_ [you have] _but_ _um_ maybe [a lot] [of] people [don't] see [it] [like] [that] _but i_ can't stand owing [. [i] mean i] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe something [like] _you know_ [i guess] [it's] [just] because [i've] [been] brought up [like] [that .] _but_ _um_ [i] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that] [i] was _going to have to_ _pay_ this thing out [for] ever [and] maybe suffer from having [to] payout . _but_ [that's] [just] [the] way [i] feel about [it .] 
B|54| M: [yeah [yeah] .] 
A|55| A: [right .] [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [and you] don tinker [with] [it [and] [i] can] [always] tell [my] husband [you] you've [got to have a] budget [and] [and um] . 
A|57| A: [oh] [yeah . [i] guess] [it] _is_ [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] [more] [and] [more] people are [like] [that .] _but_ [um] [i guess] [it's] because [i'm] older [i mean] [i'm not] real old _but i_ am older [and um] _you know_ [i] didn't feel [like] [that] [i] didn't feel [like] [i] [had] [to have] everything [. [i] guess] [it] was because [well] [i] [had] everything when [i] was at home _but i_ _i don't know_ why [i] didn't . 
B|58| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|59| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [and i'm] [like] [well] [then i'll [have] to] [make [that] [.] and i'm] [sure] [that you] [you're] [not] [going to have [to] [you] have to] [be] [you don't have to] [spend] [that] much [money] 
A|61| A: [yeah .] 
B|62| M: [and then] [you] [can] [go] [back and] [pay for it] again . 
A|63| A: huh . 
B|64| M: [so] [you know] [that's] [that] [that] [is] [a] big problem . 
A|65| A: [yeah] [well] [it] didn't hurt [you] did [it] [to] [i mean] [you] didn't [go] out [and] [charge] [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything did [you] ? 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [yeah] [well] [you] learned [then] [right] ? 
B|68| M: [yeah .] 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [you know] [that's] [not] [you're] [uh] 
A|71| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [i don't [know] [i'm] not] [sure] [how] much [they're] [charging] per [year] per [year] [but [i] mean i don't] [even] [know] [if] [i [know] what] [my] total [bill] [is] per [year] [or] per month [or] [how] much [i'm] actually supposed [to] [be] getting paid [for it .]
