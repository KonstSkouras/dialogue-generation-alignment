B|0| M: _yeah_ _it's_ _uh_ 
A|1| A: [uh] 
B|2| M: _well_ _i_ _i work_ _in_ _the_ legal department _and i_ _uh _i_ work_ _on_ [uh] speech [uh] speech recognition systems . 
A|3| A: uh-huh . me too . _i work at_ [uh] [the] georgia tech research institute . 
B|4| M: _oh yeah_ _yeah ._ 
A|5| A: _um_ _i'm_ _a_ co-op student _so_ [i work] [and] _go_ _to_ school about halftime . _and [uh_ i] _really_ _don't_ have any job benefits _to_ speak of . we're kind of _um_ [i] _don't_ know _they_ just kind of forget us [on] _that_ end . we _don't_ _really_ have any vacation or _you_ know sick days or health care or anything _really_ _so_ . 
B|6| M: _yeah ._ _well_ _that's_ _that that_ sounds _like_ [you] guys are _pretty_ _well_ employed _then_ . 
A|7| A: exactly . exactly . 
B|8| M: [i'm] [i] _i guess_ [i'm] _pretty_ lucky _because_ [i work] _for_ [a] university . 
A|9| A: what about [you] ? 
B|10| M: _well_ [i work at] [a] university . 
A|11| A: huh . 
B|12| M: [and _uh] they_ [um] . 
A|13| A: [yeah .] [uh they] _do that_ _i think_ if _you're_ [uh] research here [then] [i] know of some of [the] _people_ [that] have gotten _their_ masters [and _i] think_ [that] [um] [they] might [you] know pay [for] _that ._ pay [for] [the] classes [and] stuff 
B|14| M: [yeah] _that's_ true . 
A|15| A: _but i_ know [they] let [you] they'll let [you] decrease how many hours _you work_ by kind of percentage . [you] know they'll let _you work_ halftime if _you want to_ if _you want to_ finish 
B|16| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|17| A: _you want to_ [yeah .] they'll let _you work_ decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about _so_ if _you want to_ get your masters [and] [then] _i think_ of course [you] get [like] [a] with your extra degrees [you] get [a] pay raise due _so_ [that] will probably help _out_ . 
B|18| M: _right_ . 
A|19| A: uh-huh . 
B|20| M: [but] [uh] . 
A|21| A: [yeah .] [yeah] _i think_ _i mean_ [that's] [pretty] [that's] [a] [pretty] important [uh] part of _it_ there [because] [that that] can _be really_ expensive if [you] ever have any health problems . my dad _i think_ my [i'm] still covered [on] with my dad's [uh] health plan [at] his where he works [but] _it_ would definitely _be_ _something_ _to_ look into once [i] get my own . 
B|22| M: _well_ _i guess_ [i] [uh] . 
A|23| A: uh-huh . 
B|24| M: [i think] _it's_ going [to] [be really] hard [for] everybody [to] find [a] good program [uh] . 
A|25| A: [the] [i think] [the] [i guess] _the only_ real [um] _benefit_ [i guess] [you] could say working [for] me working here besides _i mean i'm_ learning [and] stuff [because] [i'm] [at] [you] know [in] school . 
B|26| M: [yeah .] 
A|27| A: [but] there's there's some where [uh] [uh] student employees working [for] [the] government _don't_ have [to] pay social security tax . [that's] about five percent [right] there 
B|28| M:  !!!!!!!.!! etwork !! % !! eting !!?!! [i] !! [you] !! iful !! [so] [you're] [you] [you work] [for] texas instruments ?! [you] [do] !! [that's] great !! _oh_ !! 
A|29| A: [so] . 
B|30| M: _well_ [that's] good . 
A|31| A: [that's] about _the only_ real bonus 
B|32| M: [yeah .] 
A|33| A: [i] have [so] [i] have [to] take [that] into consideration when [i] evaluate [like] how much [i] get paid [you] know [because] if [i] was working somewhere else i'd have [to] [you] know pay an extra five percent or [so] . 
B|34| M: [right] . [right] . 
A|35| A: huh . [yeah .] 
B|36| M: [but [i] guess] [that's] [the only] thing [i] _see_ changing _is_ [that] [uh] [people] are more willing [to] sacrifice [their] time [and] energy [to] [benefit] society rather than [uh] 
A|37| A: [oh yeah] ? 
B|38| M: [and] [um] . 
A|39| A: uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|40| M: [i mean i'm] sure [that] [you] [you] [don't] [want to] [go] [out] [and] [and] buy [something] [but] [you want to] [do] [it] [you] need [to] [do [that] .] 
A|41| A: help [a] lot . [yeah .] [see] around around here [it's] [like] [uh] we [pretty] much [work] from project [to] project [on] [well] [you] know with different sponsors . 
B|42| M: [yeah .] 
A|43| A: there's not there [is] not [a] whole lot of [you] know funded research from
