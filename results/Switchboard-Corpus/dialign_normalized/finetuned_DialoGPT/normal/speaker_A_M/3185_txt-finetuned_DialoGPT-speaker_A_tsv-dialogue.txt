A|11| A: _well _,_ i_ _have_ [a] friend who's _the_ same way _, and_ anything below sixty , she's _just_ _not_ happy _but_ _i , i_ think _what i would_ miss _is_ _the_ change _of_ seasons _and_ _all_ _because _i_ know_ _in_ plano _we_ _really_ _don't_ _have_ as many seasons as _, uh ,_ _my_ husband's _from_ nebraska _, and_ _they_ _have_ _more_ _of_ _the_ four seasons . 
B|12| M: _oh ,_ [really] ?

B|14| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind _me_ _of that_ _time ._ 
A|15| A: _you_ _don't_ _like the_ _cold_ . _well _,_ i_ usually _like it_ about sweater weather _, and the_ problem here _in_ plano _is_ _it_ _doesn't_ _last_ very long . 
B|16| M: [oh] . 
A|17| A: _it_ goes _from_ _hot _,_ and then_ _you_ _get_ [a] couple [of] weeks [of that] indian summer _, and then_ _it's_ _cold_ 
B|18| M: [uh] . 
A|19| A: _and i_ wish _it_ were several months [of _that] ._ 
B|20| M: _oh , yeah ._

B|22| M: [oh _,] well _,_ that's_ _that's_ [not] bad . 
A|23| A: [oh , yeah .] [well ,] sure _it_ _does ._ [that] kind [of] schedule _, you_ [really] need [a] lot _more_ sunshine . 
B|24| M: _yeah ,_ [it] [really] [does .] 
A|25| A: _and_ also _the_ evenings are going _to_ _be_ _getting_ _, uh ,_ darker sooner as _it gets_ cooler . 
B|26| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|27| A: _but_ _i_ did [a] walk _last_ night _, and it_ seemed _like it_ was [a] little bit _hot_ still . _sometimes_ when _you_ work _up_ [a] sweat _you_ need [it] _to_ _be_ [a] little bit cooler . 
B|28| M: [oh _,] that's_ _good ._ 
A|29| A: [well _,] i_ agree , absolutely _, and_ _you know _,_ it's_ _all_ relative , _because i_ was _from_ west texas _, and it_ was very dry _, and_ _so_ _i_ thought dallas was awful _, _and_ i_ still think _so_ _, but_ _then_ this summer _we_ went _to_ orlando for [a] week _, and it_ was _so_ humid there [that] your , _um ,_ _all_ your windows were were wet every morning . _they_ _had_ _to get_ _the_ squeejies _and_ clean them _off_ . 
B|30| M: [yeah .] 
A|31| A: _and_ when _we_ got back _to_ dallas [it] seemed [really] dry _because_ _it's_ kind [of] _like_ _what_ you're used _to_ . _but_ _i_ agree _with_ _you_ _, the_ humidity , especially for curly heads _like_ [me] . 
B|32| M: _yeah , [i_ , [i] know] .

A|37| A: [yeah , i] think _so_ _too ._ [i know] our _grass_ needs mowing twice as often when [it] rains 
B|38| M: [uh [,] [i] , i] [like] [to [get] out] [and] mow [my] [grass] [, too .] 
A|39| A: _but_ [it] _seems like_ here [, _i] would_ _like it_ [to] rain _and then_ _be_ over _, and then_ [not] rain for [a] while . [it] _seems like_ when _it gets_ stuck _in a_ rain pattern [, that's] _all_ [it] [does .] 
B|40| M: [uh [,] [i] , _i] guess_ [that's] [what i would] _do [, too_ .]

B|64| M: [oh ,] [really] ? 
A|65| A: everybody [seems] [to] _be_ _, you_ [can] tell some [of] [the] newscasters when _they_ [like the] heat , [because] they'll talk about [it] being [so] gorgeous on those days when we're melting [, and] _you_ [can] tell when _they_ talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're , it'll _be_ [too] _cold_ [, and] they'll _say , well_ those are [the] ones [that] [like the] _cold_ weather .

A|69| A: [he] didn't go [with] [all the] gimmicks [that] some [of] them did . 
B|70| M: [well [,] that's] true . 
A|71| A: [it's] kind [of] hard [to] keep on about [the] weather for five minutes 
B|72| M: [yeah ,] [it] [is] , [it] [really] [is] .
