B|2| M: _uh_ uh-hints .

A|11| A: _well_ _i_ _have_ [a] friend who's _the_ same way _and_ anything below sixty she's _just_ _not_ happy _but_ _i i_ think _what i would_ miss _is_ _the_ change _of_ seasons _and_ _all_ _because _i_ know_ _in_ plano _we_ _really_ _don't_ _have_ as many seasons as [uh] _my_ husband's _from_ nebraska _and_ _they_ _have_ _more_ _of_ _the_ four seasons . 
B|12| M: _oh_ [really] ? 
A|13| A: [oh] you're used _to_ _that_ _too ._ 
B|14| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind _me_ _of that_ _time ._ 
A|15| A: _you_ _don't_ _like the_ _cold_ . _well_ _i_ usually _like it_ about sweater weather _and the_ problem here _in_ plano _is it_ _doesn't_ _last_ very long . 
B|16| M: [oh] . 
A|17| A: _it_ goes _from_ _hot_ _and then_ _you_ _get_ [a] couple [of] weeks [of that] indian summer _and then_ _it's_ _cold_ 
B|18| M: [uh] . 
A|19| A: _and i_ wish _it_ were several months [of _that] ._ 
B|20| M: _oh yeah ._

B|22| M: [oh] [well] _that's_ _that's_ [not] bad . 
A|23| A: [oh yeah .] [well] sure _it_ _does ._ [that] kind [of] schedule _you_ [really] need [a] lot _more_ sunshine . 
B|24| M: [yeah] [it] [really] [does .] 
A|25| A: _and_ also _the_ evenings are going _to_ _be_ _getting_ [uh] darker sooner as _it gets_ cooler . 
B|26| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|27| A: _but_ _i_ did [a] walk _last_ night _and it_ seemed _like it_ was [a] little bit _hot_ still . _sometimes_ when _you_ work _up_ [a] sweat _you_ need [it] _to_ _be_ [a] little bit cooler . 
B|28| M: [oh] _that's_ _good ._ 
A|29| A: [well] _i_ agree absolutely _and_ _you know_ _it's_ _all_ relative _because i_ was _from_ west texas _and it_ was very dry _and_ _so_ _i_ thought dallas was awful _and i_ still think _so_ _but_ _then_ this summer _we_ went _to_ orlando for [a] week _and it_ was _so_ humid there [that] your _um_ _all_ your windows were were wet every morning . _they_ _had_ _to get_ _the_ squeejies _and_ clean them _off_ . 
B|30| M: [yeah .] 
A|31| A: _and_ when _we_ got back _to_ dallas [it] seemed [really] dry _because_ _it's_ kind [of] _like_ _what_ you're used _to_ . _but_ _i_ agree _with_ _you_ _the_ humidity especially for curly heads _like_ [me] . 
B|32| M: _yeah [i_ [i] know] .

A|37| A: [yeah i] think _so_ _too ._ [i know] our _grass_ needs mowing twice as often when [it] rains 
B|38| M: [uh] [i i] [like] [to [get] out] [and] mow [my] [grass] [too .] 
A|39| A: _but_ [it] _seems like_ here _i would_ _like it_ [to] rain _and then_ _be_ over _and then_ [not] rain for [a] while . [it] _seems like_ when _it gets_ stuck _in a_ rain pattern [that's] _all_ [it] [does .] 
B|40| M: [uh] [i _i] guess_ [that's] [what i would] _do too ._

B|42| M: [yeah .] 
A|43| A: [i guess] [my] [my] best [would] _be_ probably sixty-eight when _you_ wake _up_ or sixty-six _and then_ probably seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|44| M: [oh] [really] . 
A|45| A: [yeah .] [yeah] are _you_ [do] _you_ _like the_ heat [in] [the] summer _then_ when _it gets_ _up_ [in] [the] nineties [and] hundreds .

A|47| A: [yeah] [yeah .]
