B|56| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|57| A: [i don't] [think] [i would] [go] through [that] expense . one other benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [, i really] enjoyed [because] [they] had _what_ was called flex schedule where [i] could [go] [and i] could [work] [, uh ,] nine hour days [and] [have] [like] friday only [work] four hours
