B|56| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|57| A: [i don't] [think] [i would] [go] through [that] expense . one other benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [i really] enjoyed [because] [they] had _what_ was called flex schedule where [i] could [go] [and i] could [work] [uh] nine hour days [and] [have] [like] friday only [work] four hours 
B|58| M: [uh-huh .]

A|61| A: [well] basically [yeah i] had [to do [that] [uh] the] same [uh] [for] [about] every quarter [of] [the] [year [.] i] mean [uh] [because] [i] was [in] [a] [in] [a] position [of] management [i] had responsibilities over people [that [uh] i] needed [to] make [my] schedule [uh] [so that] [if] [i] was [not] [there] [i would] [have] coverage [by] some other management personnel 
B|62| M: [uh-huh .]

A|65| A: [and [i] [don't] have] [that] [in] [my] current operation [but uh] [you] mentioned [uh] flexible [work] schedule [and] [that's] [that's] [good] . 
B|66| M: [uh i] 
A|67| A: [and uh] _what_ other [benefits] [do] [you] [think] [are] [important] ? 
B|68| M: [well] [the [uh] _the] the_ most [important] [thing] [for] me [i guess] [is] [uh] [i'm] [i'm] [in the] medical field . 
A|69| A: [yeah] [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|70| M: [i'm] [not] _real_ sure [what] [they're] [going] [to do] [with] it .

[if] we're [you [know] if] we've been [there] [a] while [and] we're vested [uh] [which] means [that] [you know] [we] [have a] [an] interest [uh] [in the] company [that] [we] can [uh] [get] some [of] [the] [benefits] [of] [the] either [the] profit high times or or [in] [a] sense suffer during [the] low times 
B|74| M: [uh] uh-homing . 
A|75| A: [and uh] also [uh] [in] one [of] [my] wife's [uh] companies where she worked they'd had [a] [real] [nice] profit sharing [plan [that] that]
