B|24| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|25| A: five minutes , _oh ,_ [okay] . 
B|26| M: [okay ,] well , we're _all_ ready . 
A|27| A: minneapolis area , 
B|28| M: [yeah _,] yeah [,_ [yeah] .] 
A|29| A: [uh ,] actually no . _we_ _have_ _, uh ,_ quite _a_ bit _, uh _,_ the_ only problem [that] _we_ _have_ _and that's_ [all] over [the] whole world [is] ozone [and] [of] course hay fever season 
B|30| M: [oh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|31| A: [you] get some pollutants such as those _, but_ those are natural 
B|32| M: [uh] . 
A|33| A: [um] _, but_ there [is] starting [to] , _in_ minneapolis itself , because [of] [so] many people [on] [the] highway , there [is] becoming _a_ problem [of] pollution , [and] [they] [just] put _in_ _a_ strict law [that] as [of] every year when [you] get your license tabs [you] _have_ [to] _have_ your car inspected [to] see _if_ it's releasing any _, uh ,_ lead into [the] air or other pollutants , 
B|34| M: [uh] . 
A|35| A: [and] _if_ [that's] [the] case , then [you] _have_ [to] get your car fixed , 
B|36| M: [yeah .] 
A|37| A: [at] least where [you .] 
B|38| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that [,] [yeah] .] 
A|39| A: [sure] [, yeah ,] 
B|40| M: [and] they've had _it_ _for_ [a] few years now . 
A|41| A: [yeah ,] it's [not] [a] _bad_ idea . [uh-huh .] [sure] , [sure] , 
B|42| M: [they're , they're] still [, uh] 
A|43| A: exactly , 
B|44| M: _i don't know if_ [they're] going [to] [do] [that] [in] california [, _but] , uh_ 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and that's] _, that's_ _a [,_ [that] [,] that] [would] [be] [a] huge step [in] [the] [right] direction . 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|48| M: _and [,_ uh ,] she can't , she doesn't [like _the] , uh_ [the] styrofoam [, _the] [,_ the] _the [,_ you] [know] _the _,_ all the_ styrofoams , 
A|49| A: [sure] .

A|55| A: [uh [,] the] other [thing] when you're [talking] about freon with cars [, uh ,] air conditioning , [i'm] [sure] over there it's [a] necessity versus something up here [we] [can] live without [it] 
B|56| M: [uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|57| A: [but] it's uncomfortable 
B|58| M: [right] . 
A|59| A: [but [, uh] ,] [this] year my husband recharged [our] freon because [it was] , needed [to] [be] done , [and] [one of the] cans released entire amount [of] freon into [the [, uh] ,] into [the] air because he opened [it] , 
B|60| M: [uh ,] uh-hous . 
A|61| A: [and [,] [i] don't know if] there [was] something wrong with [it] , or [it] , his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto [that ,] 
B|62| M: [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [and i] [was] thinking how many other people 
B|64| M: [yeah .] 
A|65| A: [oh ,] [sure] , because [if] [you] take [it] into [a] service station [, they] want [to] charge [you] forty dollars [just] [for] [, uh ,] freon , which only costs [you] about three dollars 
B|66| M: [right] . 
A|67| A: [so] [i] [have] [this] feeling [that] freon probably will increase [in] price because [it] [is] something [that] people will [have] [to] take into consideration [and] say , hey [, that's] [that's] [right] there . 
B|68| M: [right] . 
A|69| A: [i think] it's [like] three or four dollars [a ,] [a] [can] 
B|70| M: [uh [,] that] [is] [not] [bad] [at] [all] . 
A|71| A: [and] [it] takes about four [to] five cans [to] fill up [a] air conditioning unit [in] [a] car , [and [i] , i] thought about [that ,] [and] my husband even [was] kind [of] woozy after [that] because [i'm] [sure] he breathed [it] 
B|72| M: [oh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|73| A: [but [, uh] [,] you] [think] about [that [,] all the] people [that] are using freon [and] [things] [like] [that] 
B|74| M: [yeah [,] i think] ,
