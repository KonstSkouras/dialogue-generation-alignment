A|1| A: or maybe _you_ _don't_ _like the_ person _you_ _have_ _to you_ _would_ want _to_ carpool with _that_ kind _of_ _thing_ _so_ it's it's kind _of_ _a_ _thing_ where _uh i think_ _the_ majority _of the_ people _do_ _not_ carpool . 
B|2| M: [uh] [that] [would] _be_ _true ._ 
A|3| A: [uh-huh .]

A|5| A: _yeah ._ 
B|6| M: _but uh_ . 
A|7| A: exactly . 
B|8| M: [so] _they_ they'll stay _at_ _home and_ [do] their own [thing] . 
A|9| A: [uh-huh] or _if_ somebody gets sick _. yeah_ or _if_ somebody gets sick [and] it's _not_ _the_ other person [and] [they] want _to_ go [home and] [that] _one_ person's got _the_ car then _they're they're_ stuck 
B|10| M: [yeah _.] yeah ._ 
A|11| A: you're definitely _right_ 
B|12| M: [yeah .] 
A|13| A: [uh-huh .] _sure_ . _sure_ [that] happens quite _a_ bit 
B|14| M: _and [i_ think] _that's_ _one of the_ major _things_ [that] needs [to] happen . 
A|15| A: yes [yeah] 
B|16| M: _but_ [i] donno [i] guess _i'm_ [not] _for_ [sure] what _our_ next step _is_ . 
A|17| A: [that's] very [true .] [uh] other than [that] [uh _i] don't know_ 
B|18| M: _i i_ _just_ [uh] 
A|19| A: _okay_ . 
B|20| M: [okay] [i] guess we're _on_ .

B|22| M: [okay] well _it was_ nice _talking_ [to _you] ._ 
A|23| A: [the] other [thing] then [is] because _i don't know_ how long [they] want us [to] talk

A|25| A: five minutes _oh_ [okay] . 
B|26| M: [okay] well we're _all_ ready . 
A|27| A: minneapolis area 
B|28| M: [yeah] [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|29| A: [uh] actually no . _we_ _have_ [uh] quite _a_ bit _uh the_ only problem [that] _we_ _have_ _and that's_ [all] over [the] whole world [is] ozone [and] [of] course hay fever season 
B|30| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|31| A: [you] get some pollutants such as those [but] those are natural 
B|32| M: [uh] . 
A|33| A: [um] [but] there [is] starting [to] _in_ minneapolis itself because [of] [so] many people [on] [the] highway there [is] becoming _a_ problem [of] pollution [and] [they] [just] put _in_ _a_ strict law [that] as [of] every year when [you] get your license tabs [you] _have_ [to] _have_ your car inspected [to] see _if_ it's releasing any [uh] lead into [the] air or other pollutants 
B|34| M: [uh] . 
A|35| A: [and] _if_ [that's] [the] case then [you] _have_ [to] get your car fixed 
B|36| M: [yeah .] 
A|37| A: [at] least where [you .] 
B|38| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of] [that] [yeah .] 
A|39| A: [sure] [yeah] 
B|40| M: [and] they've had _it_ _for_ [a] few years now . 
A|41| A: [yeah] it's [not] [a] _bad_ idea . [uh-huh .] [sure] [sure] 
B|42| M: [they're they're] still [uh] 
A|43| A: exactly 
B|44| M: _i don't know if_ [they're] going [to] [do] [that] [in] california _but uh_ 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and _that's] that's_ [a] [that] [that] [would] [be] [a] huge step [in] [the] [right] direction . 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|48| M: [and] [uh] she can't she doesn't [like _the] [uh_ the] styrofoam [the] [the] [the] [you] [know] [the] _all the_ styrofoams 
A|49| A: [sure] . 
B|50| M: [but] [they] _can_ [they] [know] [they're] getting [the] message . 
A|51| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . 
B|52| M: [so] . 
A|53| A: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] [sure]

A|55| A: [uh the] other [thing] when you're [talking] about freon with cars [uh] air conditioning [i'm] [sure] over there it's [a] necessity versus something up here [we] [can] live without [it] 
B|56| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [but] it's uncomfortable 
B|58| M: [right] . 
A|59| A: [but uh] [this] year my husband recharged [our] freon because [it was] needed [to] [be] done [and] [one of the] cans released entire amount [of] freon into [the uh] into [the] air because he opened [it] 
B|60| M: [uh] uh-hous . 
A|61| A: [and [i] don't know if] there [was] something wrong with [it] or [it] his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto [that] 
B|62| M: [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [and i] [was] thinking how many other people 
B|64| M: [yeah .] 
A|65| A: [oh] [sure] because [if] [you] take [it] into [a] service station [they] want [to] charge [you] forty dollars [just] [for] [uh] freon which only costs [you] about three dollars 
B|66| M: [right] . 
A|67| A: [so] [i] [have] [this] feeling [that] freon probably will increase [in] price because [it] [is] something [that] people will [have] [to] take into consideration [and] say hey [that's that's] [right] there . 
B|68| M: [right] . 
A|69| A: [i think] it's [like] three or four dollars [a] [a] [can] 
B|70| M: [uh] [that] [is] [not] [bad] [at] [all] . 
A|71| A: [and] [it] takes about four [to] five cans [to] fill up [a] air conditioning unit [in] [a] car [and [i] i] thought about [that] [and] my husband even [was] kind [of] woozy after [that] because [i'm] [sure] he breathed [it] 
B|72| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|73| A: [but uh] [you] [think] about [that] [all the] people [that] are using freon [and] [things] [like] [that] 
B|74| M: [yeah] [i think]
