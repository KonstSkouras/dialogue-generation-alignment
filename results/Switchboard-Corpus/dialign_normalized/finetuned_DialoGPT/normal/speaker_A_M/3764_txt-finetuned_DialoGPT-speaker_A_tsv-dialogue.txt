B|34| M: oh [, i] [know] . 
A|35| A: [uh ,] probably no . 
B|36| M: oh , okay . 
A|37| A: [but] then it depends on who _you_ are calling on . who you're _, you_ _like_ your minister standing up [in] front [of] _you_ _with_ no tie _, you_ just [, [uh] ,] he would [be] missing _something_ . 
B|38| M: _right ._ 
A|39| A: although , he shouldn't [be] evaluated on _that ._ 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [so] , _it's_ its' just different . 
B|42| M: [yeah] . 
A|43| A: yes , it _is_ . [i] am [, [uh] ,] _like_ [a] catholic [and] [the] people [that] _go_ [to] my church _, you know_ catholics dress very casual [a lot] [of the] times . people [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever , [but] yet [the] way [i] was raised [, i] am [a] converted catholic _, the_ way [i] was raised [, i] was raised [a] baptist [and] _like_ as [a] youngster [i] use [to] always dress up all [the] time .

A|53| A: [but] [you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|54| M: [uh ,] [well] , that's true . 
A|55| A: [and] [, [uh] ,] evaluation [of] an individual . course , all [of] it depends on [the] type [of] job responsibility [you have] . [i think] [you have to] dress sort [of] accordingly . 
B|56| M: [right .] 
A|57| A: [but , [uh] [,] you] certainly should not judge [a] book by its cover [and] [, [uh] ,] or evaluate [a] [person] by [that .] 
B|58| M: [right .]
