B|4| M: i'm _a_ graduate _of the_ school _and _so_ i_ _know_ _a lot_ _about_ _that_ kind _of_ thing . 
A|5| A: look professional 
B|6| M: uh-huh . 
A|7| A: _yeah_ [i] understand . [i] am [a] [i] _own_ my company . [i] am [in] [the] [i] am [uh] manufactures rep sales organization [and] my office _is_ [a] small office _and i_ am very casual [and] wear slacks [and] sports shirt [and] things _like that_ 
B|8| M: uh-huh . 
A|9| A: [but] then when [i] travel it _is_ [a] _little_ different situation . 
B|10| M: _right ._ 
A|11| A: _yeah_ _i think_ [in] today's society [uh] there _is_ more credibility _to be_ quite honest 
B|12| M: [uh] [yeah] . 
A|13| A: [i] will always remember [i] will tell this _real_ quick story when [i] graduated from college my first job years ago [uh] thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago [in] fact was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|14| M:  !!! % !! remind _me_ . 
A|15| A: [i] worked for _the uh_ smith douglas division [of] borden chemical _and i_ sold _uh you know_ manure . 
B|16| M: oh really ? 
A|17| A: [and] _uh i_ would _go out and_ call on farmers _and i_ would always try _to_ look my best wearing sport coats [and] things _like that_ [but] [i] was calling on guys [that] wore bib overalls . 
B|18| M: oh really . 
A|19| A: [and so] one day [i] got up [and] thought [well i] will just _go_ casual [and] _you know that_ [i] called on [a] guy wearing exactly [that] bib overalls [and] he sort [of] told [me] [that] he expected [me] _to be_ professional 
B|20| M: [uh] . 
A|21| A: [and] he sort [of] expected [me] _to_ dress as [a] professional 
B|22| M: _right ._ 
A|23| A: [so] [uh] it was sort [of] 
B|24| M: oh . 
A|25| A: _you_ bet even back then 
B|26| M: [yeah] they had [to be] [in] their [own] [little] world . 
A|27| A: [so i] sort [uh] been aware [of] my dress ever since then [and] try [to] look my best 
B|28| M: uh-huh . 
A|29| A: [but] here again [i] dress casual quite [a] bit [so] 
B|30| M: [yeah] . 
A|31| A: it gives _you_ confidence . [in] my business if [i] call on _the the_ j c penney company here [in] dallas or say someone say sears [and] roebuck [in] chicago then [i] wear coat [and] tie . if [i] call on just [uh] [a] normal [little] dealer [of] mine [i] might [be] casual . 
B|32| M: [uh i] _have_ [uh i] _have_ [a] problem uh-hilted skirt . 
A|33| A: [i] call on oshman's sporting goods again it may [be] casual or it may [be] coat [and] tie . [so] it depends . 
B|34| M: oh [i] [know] . 
A|35| A: [uh] probably no . 
B|36| M: oh okay . 
A|37| A: [but] then it depends on who _you_ are calling on . who you're _you_ _like_ your minister standing up [in] front [of] _you_ _with_ no tie _you_ just [uh] he would [be] missing _something_ . 
B|38| M: _right ._ 
A|39| A: although he shouldn't [be] evaluated on _that ._ 
B|40| M: [yeah] . 
A|41| A: [so] _it's_ its' just different . 
B|42| M: [yeah] . 
A|43| A: yes it _is_ . [i] am [uh] _like_ [a] catholic [and] [the] people [that] _go_ [to] my church _you know_ catholics dress very casual [a lot] [of the] times . people [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever [but] yet [the] way [i] was raised [i] am [a] converted catholic [the] way [i] was raised [i] was raised [a] baptist [and] _like_ as [a] youngster [i] use [to] always dress up all [the] time . [i] guess [that] has changed also . 
B|44| M: oh [yeah] [yeah] . 
A|45| A: [right .] 
B|46| M: _but uh_ . 
A|47| A: sure . 
B|48| M: [and i] [i think] [that] [the [the] [uh] you know] [the] [real] problem [with] [the] [with] [the] whole system [is] [is] [uh] . 
A|49| A: [but] . [that] [is] [a] very good point . [i] am from west virginia [so i] understand what [you] are saying there 
B|50| M: uh-huh . 
A|51| A: _and it's_ _it's_ [a] very good point . 
B|52| M: [and it's] hard [to] believe [that] [you know that] [the] average _person_ can't afford [you] can't imagine [you] _you have to_ pay [that] much money [to] [to] [go out and] do [something] [like [that] .] 
A|53| A: [but] [you] shouldn't what's [the] old saying [you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|54| M: [uh] [well] that's true . 
A|55| A: [and] [uh] evaluation [of] an individual . course all [of] it depends on [the] type [of] job responsibility [you have] . [i think] [you have to] dress sort [of] accordingly . 
B|56| M: [right .] 
A|57| A: [but [uh] you] certainly should not judge [a] book by its cover [and] [uh] or evaluate [a] [person] by [that .] 
B|58| M: [right .] 
A|59| A: what [about] season [to] season . does [i] guess your dress changes . 
B|60| M: [well] [uh] .
