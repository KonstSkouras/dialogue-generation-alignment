B|42| M: [right] . 
A|43| A: _you you_ _see_ somebody's mini series [and you] hear [about] somebody's _crime_ [there] [was] _something_ on [and] this gets [back] [to] capital [punishment] [but] [the] man [had] stolen [uh] _not_ stolen [but] kidnapped [uh] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere [in] florida [and] they changed all [the] facts [that] they said [it was] _true_ 
B|44| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|45| A: [and] they buried her alive 
B|46| M: [right] . 
A|47| A: [and] peter strauss [had] played [the] lead role [and] [the] man [and] [and] at [the] end [of] [you know] how they [have] these mini dramas at [the] end they said this set person [was] paroled like six months ago _and you're_ _thinking_ [oh] [that's] [nice] . 
B|48| M: [oh] . 
A|49| A: [i mean] [you know] _i'm not sure_ [that] capital [punishment] serves as [a] deterrence [but] [it] does serve as [a uh] definite [you know] lasting

A|51| A: [right] [in] [that] particular instance [uh] [but i] _but i don't_ [but [i] know] [it's] on [a] [and] all [and] [be] all 
B|52| M: [that's] [right] . 
A|53| A: [that's] [the] problem [i] [have] [with] [it] [in] texas they _think it's_ [and] all [and] [be] all they [think] [that] if they electrocute or slip or _do something_ or gas somebody [uh] [that] they're _not_ going [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] they _do_ [have] [and we] happen [to] [live in] dallas which is extremely _crime_ ridden 
B|54| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hue . 
A|55| A: [and we] [just] moved here [uh] we've [been] here before _lived_ [in] minneapolis saint paul [uh] which has an exceedingly low _crime_ rate [and then] [we] were transferred [back] here [and] _when_ _you're_ gone from some place like [it] [for] [about] six years as [we] were _you really_ begin [to] _see_ [uh] [just] how problematic [just] living is even suburban no matter [where _you] are_

B|62| M: [well it] [it] [just] _happened_ [so] fast [i mean] [it was] [just you _know] the_ minute [the] sun went [down] _it would_ [just] completely turn yellow [you] couldn't [see] [the] dirt . 
A|63| A: is [that] [in] term 
B|64| M: _yeah and i'm_ [thinking] um we're talking [about] um 
A|65| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [but uh] . 
A|67| A: _sure ._ 
B|68| M: _and uh_ . 
A|69| A: how [would] how is _the situation_ [in] [there] [in] terms [of] _crime_ [and] [and] things [that] [would] 
B|70| M: [well] [i think it's] improving . 
A|71| A: _not_ too bad _. yeah ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [but uh] . 
A|73| A: _not_ [the] harsh criminality [that] [you] find [in] 
B|74| M: [yeah .] 
A|75| A: [yeah] now dallas is [a] [i'm] [being] very sarcastic [it's [just] a] great [uh] on some days [uh] [it's] [uh _i] don't [know_ the] [good] ole boy network here is [uh] very strange like [i] said they believe [that] if they kill somebody [you know] tit [for] tat [and] deed [for] deed [that] [that] does _something_ [uh] 
B|76| M: [yeah [.] [yeah] that's] [true] . 
A|77| A: [but] yet they [want] spend [the] money [to] build [the] new jails _that [i_ mean] they [really] _are_ [over] crowded 
B|78| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|79| A: [i mean] [that's] [that's] [just] _not_ [a] cop out [uh] [and i] [just you know] [i'm] originally from pennsylvania which [i think] is basically like new york these days _i'm not sure_ if they [i don't] [think] they [have] capital [punishment] [there .] 
B|80| M: [yeah .] 
A|81| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] and i'm] from pittsburgh [so] [oh] [well] we'll forgive each other 
B|82| M: [yeah .]

B|88| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [but [uh] _i] don't know [i_ think] everybody [would] feel [it] is same [way] if they were touched by _crime_ _. i think_ everyone [would] [you] [and i think] _are_ honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do_ [it] on [in] this vehicle [uh] 
B|90| M: [yeah .] 
A|91| A: [but [i] think] everybody if they were touched by [it would] say if they [had] _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [i think] every human does [i think] they'd say [yeah] 
B|92| M: [i think that's] [true] . 
A|93| A: _do_ [it] if somebody [in] my family or if _it happened_ [it] [me] [you know] 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [uh]

A|97| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] i] [just] [don't] [think] _that uh_ [you] can rehabilitate [i mean i] [just] [don't] [uh] [oh i] did [a] paper [back] [in] college [a] long time ago [for] criminal justice class [and i] [just] [the] subject [i] remember [we] drew things out [of] [a] hat [and] [it was] [something] [uh] [it was] basically [the] essence [was] does [the] _crime_ fit [the punishment] [and] [when] [you] [see] how many repeat offenders [there] _are_ [uh] check check fraud cases [where] they [go] [to] jail [for] five [to] ten years [and uh] rape rapist getting their hand [just] slapped _you know and_ how [it] is based on [the] judge [and] if [the] time [of] day [that] [the] court is [in] session [you know] all these [uh] intangible things 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: _and you're_ [thinking] [oh] [you] [would] _not_ only [would] [you] _not_ [want to be a] victim [you] wouldn't [want to be a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't [know] _what_ _you're_ getting [uh] 
B|100| M: [uh] [yeah [.] yeah .] 
A|101| A: _but i don't know_ methods [of] capital [punishment] [i] [have] no opinions on [that] either [i] [just] 
B|102| M:  !!! % !! remind [me] [of] [that i] [i know] exactly [what] [you are] talking [about] .

A|107| A: [yeah .] [i'm not] even [sure] [in] [the] split among [the] fifty states [do] [you know] which [way] [it] is [the] ratio [it's [more] than] aren't [uh] [it's more] [that] [don't] [have] [it] 
B|108| M: _yeah i don't [know_ .]

B|110| M: [but [i don't know] i] donno . 
A|111| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|112| M: [and it's] [it was] [a] [it] [it] wasn't [a] particularly [heinous] [crime] [it] [just you know] [it happened] [in] such [a] random [and] unusual [way] [that uh] . 
A|113| A: [yeah i don't know] if they've they did [something] [about] [i'm not sure] if texas minnesota [i] they [didn't] they [didn't] they were [well] did they [have] [it] they were against [it] [uh] texas as [i] said has [it] [but i] haven't [been] [back] here long enough [to] [to] realize whether or [not] if they've done [it] [in] [the] last
