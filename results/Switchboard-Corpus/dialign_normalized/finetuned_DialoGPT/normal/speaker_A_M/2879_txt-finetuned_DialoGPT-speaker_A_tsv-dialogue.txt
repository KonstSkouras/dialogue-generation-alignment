A|37| A: [so] many times . 
B|38| M: [yeah [, [and] i] think] [it was] _, it was_ _just a_ publicity thing . [you know ,] [he] went [over] [there] [and] [he] [was] _being_ [, uh ,] excused [because he] _didn't_ _want to be a_ policeman .

B|40| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! remindme ! remind !! et !! command

B|42| M: [right] . 
A|43| A: _you , you_ _see_ somebody's mini series [and you] hear [about] somebody's _crime ,_ [there] [was] _something_ on [, and] this gets [back] [to] capital [punishment] _, but_ [the] man [had] stolen [, uh ,] _not_ stolen [but] kidnapped [, uh ,] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere [in] florida [and] they changed all [the] facts [that] they said [it was] _true_

A|45| A: [and] they buried her alive 
B|46| M: [right] . 
A|47| A: [and] peter strauss [had] played [the] lead role [and] [the] man [, [and] [,] and] at [the] end [of _,] you know_ how they [have] these mini dramas , at [the] end they said , this set person [was] paroled like six months ago _and you're_ _thinking_ [oh [,] that's] [nice] . 
B|48| M: [oh] . 
A|49| A: [i mean _,] you know _,_ _i'm_ not sure_ [that] capital [punishment] serves as [a] deterrence [but] [it] does serve as [a] [uh ,] definite _, you know ,_ lasting 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [right] , [in] [that] particular instance [, uh _,] [but_ [i] _,] _but_ i don't_ _, [but_ [i] know] [it's] on [a] [and] all [and] [be] all , 
B|52| M: [that's] [right] . 
A|53| A: [that's] [the] problem [i] [have] [with] _it ,_ [in] texas they _think it's_ [and] all [and] [be] all , they [think] [that] if they electrocute or slip , or _do something_ , or gas somebody [, uh ,] [that] they're _not_ going [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] they _do_ [have] [and we] happen [to] [live in] dallas which is extremely _crime ,_ ridden ,

A|63| A: is [that] [in] term , 
B|64| M: _yeah , and i'm_ _thinking ,_ um , we're talking [about ,] um 
A|65| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [but , uh] . 
A|67| A: _sure ._ 
B|68| M: _and , uh_ .

A|71| A: _not_ too bad _. yeah ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [but , uh] . 
A|73| A: _not_ [the] harsh criminality , [that] [you] find [in] , 
B|74| M: [yeah .] 
A|75| A: [yeah ,] now , dallas is [a] [i'm] [being] very sarcastic , [it's [just] a] great [, uh ,] on some days [, uh ,] _it's [,_ uh _, i] don't know_ [the] [good] ole boy network here is [, uh ,] very strange , like [i] said they believe [that ,] if they kill somebody [, you know ,] tit [for] tat [and ,] deed [for] deed [that ,] [that] does _something_ [, uh ,] 
B|76| M: [yeah [.] [yeah ,] that's] [true] . 
A|77| A: [but] yet they [want] spend [the] money [to] build [the] new jails _that [, i_ mean ,] they [really] _are_ [over] , crowded , 
B|78| M: [oh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|79| A: [i mean [,] that's [,] that's] [just] _not_ [a] cop out [, uh [,] and i] [just , you know _,] i'm_ originally from pennsylvania which [i think] is basically like new york these days _, _i'm_ not sure_ if they _, i don't_ [think] they [have] capital [punishment] [there .] 
B|80| M: [yeah .]

B|88| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [but [, uh] _, i] don't know_ [i think] everybody [would] feel [it] is same [way] if they were touched by _crime_ _. i think_ everyone [would] [, you] [and i think] _are_ honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do_ [it] on , [in] this , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|90| M: [yeah .] 
A|91| A: [but [i] think] everybody if they were touched by [it would] say , if they [had] _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [, i think] every human does [, i think] they'd say [, yeah ,] 
B|92| M: [i think that's] [true] . 
A|93| A: _do_ [it] if somebody [in] my family or if _it happened_ [it] [me] [, you know ,] 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [uh ,]

A|97| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah ,] i] [just ,] [don't] [think] _that [, uh_ [,] you] can rehabilitate [, i mean] [i] [just] [don't] [, uh [,] oh , i] did [a] paper [back] [in] college [a] long time ago [for] criminal justice class [, and i] [just [,] the] subject [, i] remember [we] drew things out [of] [a] hat [and] [it was] [something] [, uh [,] it was] basically [the] essence [was] does [the] _crime_ fit [the punishment] [and] [when] [you] [see] how many repeat offenders [there] _are_ [, uh ,] check , check fraud cases [where] they [go] [to] jail [for] five [to] ten years [and [, uh] ,] rape , rapist getting their hand , [just] slapped _, you know , and_ how [it] is based on [the] judge [and] if [the] time [of] day [that] [the] court is [in] session [, you know ,] all these [, uh ,] intangible things 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: _and you're_ [thinking [,] oh [,] you] [would] _not_ only [would] [you] _not_ [want to be a] victim [you] wouldn't [want to be a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't [know] _what_ _you're_ getting [, uh] 
B|100| M: [uh [,] [yeah] [.] yeah .]
