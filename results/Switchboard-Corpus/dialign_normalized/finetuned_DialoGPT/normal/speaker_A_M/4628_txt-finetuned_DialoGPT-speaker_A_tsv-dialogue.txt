B|0| M: _but_ um _i think_ _i i_ _do_ _know_ _that_ _they_ _have_ _they_ _have_ _a few_ different dress codes _and_ um 
A|1| A: uh-huh . 
B|2| M: _but_ _we're_ _trying to_ keep _it_ up _uh and uh_ 
A|3| A: uh-huh . 
B|4| M: _and_ _i'm_ not _i'm_ pretty _much_ limited _to_ _just_ _the_ large study areas . 
A|5| A: huh . _well_ [i i] _work_ _for_ [uh] actually probably similar kind _of_ place _. i_ _work_ _for_ [uh] lincoln laboratory . 
B|6| M: oh uh-hoh . 
A|7| A: [uh] _yeah ._ _we_ actually [do] some _work_ _with_ some _people_ down at georgia tech . 
B|8| M: okay . 
A|9| A: [uh and uh] _so_ [we're] [we're] part [we're] actually part _of_ m [i] t . _so_ _it's_ _very_ [much] [the] same kind _of_ place [and _uh] the_ technical institution . 
B|10| M: [yeah .] 
A|11| A: [uh] while [i] was sitting here waiting while [they] tried [to] find somebody _for_ me [to] talk [to] [trying to] [think] _of_ _what_ [uh] [uh] _what_ things were important [uh] besides salary [and] [a] [and] [a] job _. _i_ guess_ [uh] list [i] had scribbled down was _the people_ _you_ worked _with_ [and] maybe _the uh the_ challenge _of the_ _work_ [and _uh] the_ working conditions things like _that ._ 
B|12| M: [yeah .] [yeah .] [yeah] _i think_ _i don't know_ [i _i] know_ [that] there _are_ [a] lot [of] [people] who [uh] 
A|13| A: [i don't know] . _what_ [are] your [uh] _what_ sorts [of] things _would_ _you_ consider important ? 
B|14| M: [well] [uh] . 
A|15| A: uh-huh . 
B|16| M: _and i think_ [that] [uh] _i think uh_ [you] [know] we've [we're] [we] _have to_ be careful _about_ [what] [we] [do] [with] them . 
A|17| A: uh-huh . 
B|18| M: [and uh] [you] [know] [people] [they] [don't] want [to] be called out [for] something they're not supposed [to] be doing . 
A|19| A: [yeah .] 
B|20| M: [and uh] . 
A|21| A: uh-huh . 
B|22| M: [so] [they] _just_ sort [of] [you] can't say okay [we're] not going [to] [do] this [we] won't [do] this . [we're] _just_ going [to] let [you] go _. and_ then [they] [would] come in [and] say you're not [you] [don't] _have to_ _do [that_ .] 
A|23| A: uh-huh . 
B|24| M: _but_ [they] could [you] could make _it_ [a] practice . 
A|25| A: uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [i] _mean_ that's [that] [would] be [a] good way [to] [do] _it_ . 
A|27| A: now how [do] [you] [mean] [that] ? [i know] [it] 
B|28| M: [it's] [uh] . 
A|29| A: uh-huh . 
B|30| M: [i] [mean] _i've_ seen [it] in other places [and] [it's] [uh] [i guess] [it's] almost impossible [to] say [it's] any worse _than_ any other _company_ [uh] . 
A|31| A: uh-huh . 
B|32| M: [and] that's that's [a] negative [of] mine [. [i] i] [the] only [the] one [the uh] one positive [that] [i] see is [that] [they] [don't] _have_ enough time [to] devote [to] [the] needs [of [the] people] . 
A|33| A: [well] [you] [you] [think] [it's] _better_ [than] [to] [to] try [to] spread [the] [the] effort equally among all [the] employees [of the] [company] or 
B|34| M: [uh] _i think_ [it] [would] be [better] [to] _have_ _have_ [uh [the] uh the] unanimous vote . 
A|35| A: uh-huh . 
B|36| M: _i think_ [that] [uh] [that] [the uh] ... 
A|37| A: uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [and] [they] could see [that] there's [a] lot [of] [people] [that] [don't] want [to] [work] . 
A|39| A: [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|40| M: _and i think_ that's _i think_ they're both [very] true . 
A|41| A: [yeah .] [i've] heard [of] [a] couple [of] companies [that] [have] done [that [.] [i] think uh] back [about] [a few] years ago when things were tough hewlett-packard did [that] [for] awhile . [they] went [to] [a] [uh] [a] [a] four [and] [a] half day [work] week rather [than] cut [yeah] [just] cut everybody back ten percent [. [and] uh] [have to] give everybody [a] half day [a] week off . 
B|42| M: right . 
A|43| A: [and i think] [you] can [do that] [for] [a] little while [but] [i'm] 
B|44| M: [yeah] [that] [that] [would] be [a] good idea . 
A|45| A: [yeah .]
