B|47| M: [so] [i'm] _not_ _really_ going _to have_ much choice [i] guess . 
A|48| A: [yeah] [that's good .] [well] one [of] [my] favorites [if] [i don't] want [to have] other [people] bring stuff [i just] want [to] treat [them] [is] [to make] chicken [and] rice . 
B|49| M: uh-uh . uh-uh uh-uh 
A|50| A: [it's] [very] easy [to] . 
B|51| M: [oh] _i'll_ _have to_ try [that .] 
A|52| A: _you don't_ [like] [it] ? 
B|53| M: no huh-uh . 
A|54| A: [oh] [you] [do] _okay_ [yeah [.] [i] have a] [really] easy recipe [for] [that] where _you just_ brown [the] chicken _and then you put_ rice [in the] bottom [of] [the] pan [you] pour bouillon [or] chicken broth _over it_ 
B|55| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and _and] you put_ [the] chicken [in] [then] pour [the uh] broth [over] _and you can put_ mushrooms [in] [if you] want _and then you just_ . 
B|57| M:  !!! % [okay] [okay] . 
A|58| A: [yeah] [over] uncooked rice 
B|59| M: [okay] . 
A|60| A: _and _you can_ either_ _microwave_ [it] [or] [do] [it in the] oven [and] [it] [just] . 
B|61| M: [okay] . 
A|62| A: [it] fluffs _up_ [and] [it's] [really] moist . 
B|63| M: _i'll_ bet . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh] wow [yeah .] 
B|65| M: [and then you just] cover [it] _with_ [a] [uh] newspaper [and you] cover [it] [and then you put] [it in] [a] [microwave] [for] _about_ five minutes [and then] [uh] [put] [it] _on_ [the next] plate [and] [uh] [and] cover [it [.] [and] you can put] [uh] carrots [and] green peppers [and and] green olives _on_ _there_ _too_ . 
A|66| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [so i] [i] [uh] [i] try [to] [i [like] [to] make] sure [i don't] [make] _too_ many mistakes 
A|68| A: [well] [i'll] [keep] [that] one [in] mind . 
B|69| M: _yeah [i_ don't] _know_ [if] _i've_ ever had [uh] _you know_ [a] real [good] [uh] real [good] ham [or] [if] _i'd_ [just] had ham . 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| M: _i've_ been trying [to make] [a] [a] fajita now [and] [i'm] _not_ _you know_ [i don't] _know_ [if] [it's] fajitas [or] _what_ _but [you_ just] [put] [it] _on_ [the] outside [and you] marinate [it] [and you put] [uh] [put] tomato sauce [over it] [and] [i just] love [that .] 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| M: [and] [i] _was_ going [okay] [i'm] going [to] take [that] [that] [and then] [i] took [um .] 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [you can] [get] away [with] [it] even _having a_ semi _nice_ dinner 
B|75| M: [yeah] [it's] _not_ [it] [it] doesn't [really] 
A|76| A: _or [you_ know] semi . 
B|77| M: [uh] [well i'm] _not_ [really] into formal dining [out] [i] [i like] [just] [having a] [nice] meal . 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| M: _but_ [um] [i don't] [know] [. i] guess [i just] [i] guess [i'm] _not_ [i'm] [just] _not_ [really] into [it .] 
A|80| A: [yeah .] [you put] [in] [um] 
B|81| M: [and] [uh] [it's] [a good] thing [to have] [because] [it] makes [the uh] [the] meatballs come [out] [a] lot bigger . 
A|82| A: let's _see_ [what] [was it] three quarters [of] cup [of] rice [or] 
B|83| M: [uh] [i don't] _remember ._ _it was_ something [like that .] 
A|84| A: [it] depends [on] [you can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|85| M: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: [but _you] have to_ [put] [the] water [in] proportionally [. i] [can't] [remember [.] [i] think] [it was] three quarters cup rice [to] [two] cups water [two] cups [um] broth . 
B|87| M: [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [yeah] flavor . [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|89| M: [i] mean [it's] _not_ [like] [it's] [a] big [uh] thick piece [of] something 
A|90| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [and] [uh] [that's] [the] type [of] thing [i [like] to] experiment [with] [. i] [uh] [i] [it's] [it [was] it] [it] seemed [to be] [a] [very] interesting thing [to] [do] [. [i] don't] [know] [it] sounds [like] [you] might enjoy [it .] 
A|92| A: [um] let's _see [._ [i] think] [it was] [an hour] . [i've] [done] _it in the microwave_ [so] often lately [because] [it's] [it's] [really] easy . 
B|93| M: [oh] [i] [see .] 
A|94| A: [yeah .] [but [i] think it's] [about] [an hour] . 
B|95| M: [oh] [okay] . 
A|96| A: [or] maybe [it's] only half [hour] . [um] [you just] until [the] rice looks fluffy [and and] [not] overdone . [you know] before [it] gets overdone . 
B|97| M: [oh] [that's good .] 
A|98| A: [yeah .] 
B|99| M: [okay] . 
A|100| A: [um] [i'd] [let it cook] [just] [a] little bit [just] [so] [that] [the] cooking goes [a] little faster . 
B|101| M: [okay] . 
A|102| A: [yeah i] liked your _idea_ [too] [there] . 
B|103| M: [i] [i like] [the] [idea .] 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: [and then [you] can either] go ahead [and] [cook] [it in the microwave] [or [you] can] [just] leave [it in] [there] [and] [let it] rise [and then] [uh] heat [it] [up] . 
A|106| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: [uh] [you can] [you don't] [have [to] be] [you have to] you've [just] [put] [it in] [there] [you just] [have to] accept [it [.] [i] don't] [know] how long [it] takes [i] guess . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [and] [i] love [it] [when they] come home [and] they're [just] lonesome [and and] [the] smell [is] [just] [just] absolutely wonderful .
