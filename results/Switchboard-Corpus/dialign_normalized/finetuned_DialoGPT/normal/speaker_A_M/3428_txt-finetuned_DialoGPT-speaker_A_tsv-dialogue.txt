A|1| A: _yeah_ _i_ can _i_ can understand _that . i_ was raised _in_ oklahoma [and] of course being oklahoman [and] texan [uh] _yeah_ the hunting [and] everything [and] _i_ used _to_ things _in_ my father [and] my husband having guns [and] all [and] _i i_ did used _to_ be all _in_ favor of _it_ but _it's_ all of _a_ sudden _it's_ starting _to_ get really scary with these gangs . yet _i think_ _i_ would vote _a_ one if _i_ thought _that_ _it_ would be nation wide [and] they can guarantee no one would _have_ _a gun_ no crooks nothing . but because _i_ _know_ _that's_ not going _to_ happen then _i_ _have to_ probably _right_ up there _about_ an eight 
B|2| M: [right] [right] . 
A|3| A: _well_ _it_ _just_ seems like _in_ the past three or four years _it_ has _just_ gotten _so_ _much_ worse than _it_ was . there's always _been a_ certain amount of crime _in your_ _you know_ _your_ urban areas [and] _i_ _know_ we lived _in_ chicago _for_ seven years [and] of course _it_ was definitely there . _so_ when we first moved here _it_ wasn't as bad as this . _it's_ _you know_ _it's_ _just_ getting all of _a_ sudden _so_ _much_ worse _. i_ _don't_ _know_ whether _it's_ due _to_ the drugs [and] the [uh] drug kings _that_ are here [and] jamaican drug kings coming _in_ _. i_ _don't_ _know_ whether _that's_ _it_ or street gangs _. i_ _don't_ _know_ what the answer is _. i_ _know_ _that_ _it's_ scary [and] yet _i_ hate the government constantly telling me what _i_ can do [and] what _i_ can't do [and] _that's_ basically what the _gun_ control would end up being . 
B|4| M: uh-huh . 
A|5| A: _well_ _it's_ very true . 
B|6| M: [uh] [i] [you] [you] [you know] [i think] [it's] [so] [you] [don't] [have to] worry [about] [it] _too_ [much] _. uh_ i've [i] live [in] [a] small town [in] [a] town [in] mesquite 
A|7| A: [it's] not the law abiding citizen _that_ [you know] is is dangerous with the _gun_ [it's] the ones _that_ are going out [and] stealing [it] . 
B|8| M: [right] . 
A|9| A: [and] [i] said [i think] the only way [i] would be [in] big favor of _gun_ control is if they could absolutely guarantee _that_ nobody would [have] _them_ . [and] [i think] _that_ would almost [have _to] go_ with armies [too] _. i_ mean they'd [have to] be almost world-wide which we [know] would never ever happen . 
B|10| M: [right] . 
A|11| A: because _even_ if [you] said okay [you know] armed forces could [have] _them_ some idiot would come out [and] sell [it] [to] somebody on the street [to] make [a] quick buck . 
B|12| M: [right] . 
A|13| A: _that's_ very true very true . who knows we maybe want [to] overthrow the government 
B|14| M: [yeah] . 
A|15| A: [i] [know] if somebody doesn't do something [. uh] what [about] [uh] what do [you] [think] of this this [uh] law _that_ they're putting into effect _that_ [you] [have to] wait x number of days before [you] can [uh] carry the _gun_ or buy [you know] actually purchase the _gun_ ? 
B|16| M: [well] [that's] [a] good question [. [i] [i] think] [it's] [it's] [been a] while since i've [even] talked [to] [a] person [about] [that . [i] think] they've [just] [uh] 
A|17| A: yes . 
B|18| M: [and] [you] had [to] [have] [your] [gun] [in your] name . [you] had [to go] [to] [a gun] show [and] ask [them] [for] [a] driver's license .
