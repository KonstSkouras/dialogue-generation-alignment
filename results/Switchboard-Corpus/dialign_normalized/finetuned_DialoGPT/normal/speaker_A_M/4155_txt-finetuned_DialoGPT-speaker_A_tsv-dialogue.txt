B|42| M: [and i] [and i] [you] know [i] [just] [i] feel like [you] [you] [can't] [you] _don't_ have [to] [pay] [for] [it] [you] [just] have [to] accept [it] . 
A|43| A: [uh-huh .] _taxes ._ 
B|44| M: _so_ [i'm] paying twice [as] [much] [as] [i] would have been paying [in [taxes] _.] _so_ _i_ don't_ know [i i] _think_ that's [a] problem with _the the_ [uh] _the_ economy . 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and] _so _i_ don't_ [i] don tinker with [it] [too much] . 
A|47| A: huh . 
B|48| M: [but] _uh i_ 
A|49| A: [yeah .] 
B|50| M: [and] it's it's amazing [that] people _don't_ realize this .

A|57| A: everybody says [that] 
B|58| M: [yeah .] 
A|59| A: huh . 
B|60| M: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: [um] [i] [haven't] [i] [haven't] gotten [too] terribly [much] into my major yet . actually [um] [the the] degree [i'm] getting _is_ physics . there's [a] different one [for] applied physics [so [i] guess] [you] could call [it] _more_ straight stuff than applied . 
B|62| M: [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [i] doubt [about] [that] . [are] [are] _is_ america [i mean] [are] [we] _pretty_ _pretty_ steep compared [to] most countries ? 
B|64| M: [well _i] don't_ know [i] _think_ [uh i] [i'm] not [really] [sure] [um] . [i] _think_ it's [a] it's probably [a] [a] [pretty] good indicator [of] how [well] [you're] handling [the] problem . 
A|65| A: no [i don't] [think] [so] either . 
B|66| M: [you] know [i] [think] [uh] [in] [in] [some] ways it's better [to] have [the] metric system [and] [and uh] [the] english system [you] know [it] seems like [uh] . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [but] [uh] [you] know it's [it] [is] [it] [it] seems like it's [a] lot [more] lax [you] [can't [really] make] everything seem like [you're] [going to] be good [you're] not [going to get] caught every [time] . 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and] [you] know [and] [and i] [think] it's [going to] be real important . [i] [think] [the the] way [the] government [is] running it's [really] [going to] have [to get] even [more] important .
