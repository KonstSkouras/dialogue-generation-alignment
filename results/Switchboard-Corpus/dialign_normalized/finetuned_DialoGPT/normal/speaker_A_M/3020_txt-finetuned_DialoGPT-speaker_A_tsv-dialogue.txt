A|103| A: china [was] [a little bit] more [uh [of] a] challenge . [but] [it] [it] wasn't more [of a] challenge [in] [a] sense [because] [i] hired [a] guide [all] [the] time 
B|104| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [and] [so] [i] never [you know] got _out_ [by] myself [or] [not] much

B|110| M: [oh] [really] . 
A|111| A: [and] [that] [i had] [two] internal [one] [yeah] [two] internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other [things] . [it] [was] [really]
