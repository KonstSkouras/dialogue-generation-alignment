A|93| A: [oh , i] [like that] too . [but [, uh] , in] fact [i] didn't eat _out_ [that] much [there] [because] [i] [was] traveling [by] myself [in] [a] car , [it] [would] [have] [been] [, [i think] ,] much more fun [to] [do] [it] [like] [in] [the] van , _with_ [a] bunch [of] people .

A|103| A: china [was] [a little bit] more [, uh ,] [of a] challenge . [but ,] [it] , [it] wasn't more [of a] challenge [in] [a] sense [because] [i] hired [a] guide [all] [the] time , 
B|104| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [and] [so] [i] never [, [you] [know] ,] got _out_ [by] myself , [or] [not] much , 
B|106| M: [yeah .] uh-hue . 
A|107| A: [no ,] _actually_ [i] paid about either [a] thousand dollars [or] [a little bit] , [no] maybe [it] [was] about [a] thousand dollars , maybe [a little bit] less [, i don't] [really] remember , [for] ten days including [all] [my] meals , [a] guide , [a] car [, the] airfare [and ,] [but] [this] [is] from hong kong ,

B|110| M: [oh [,] really] . 
A|111| A: [and] [that [,] [i] had] [two] internal , [one] _, yeah ,_ [two] internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other [things] . [it] [was] [really] , 
B|112| M: [oh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|113| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: [oh , that's] [great] . 
A|115| A: around [a] thousand .
