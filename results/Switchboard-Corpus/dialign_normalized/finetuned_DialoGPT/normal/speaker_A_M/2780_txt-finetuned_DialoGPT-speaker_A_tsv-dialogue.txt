A|37| A: [well] i'll tell [you [.] i] [i think] [you know] [if] [they] [if] [they] didn't [give] [as] [much] coverage [to] these idiots [that] burn _the flag ,_ _it would_ _never_ happen _do [you_ know] [what] [i mean] ? 
B|38| M: [i _know] ._ 
A|39| A: [it's] only because [they] [make] [a] big stink over _it ._ _but_ [i] [i guess] actually [i] believe [that if] somebody wants [to] burn _the flag_ [i guess] [that's] [their] opportunity [they're] [they're] [they're] [right] [in the] sense [of] _freedom of speech_ _but_ [i] _would_ _never_ 
B|40| M: _right ._ 
A|41| A: [yeah .] 
B|42| M: [i] _, _i don't know_ [._ i] , [i'm] not [really] [for] _it . i_ don [, _i] mean [,_ [i] think] [, i] , 
A|43| A: [yeah .] [well] [it's] [that] [they] [i think] [the] idea [of] _freedom of speech_ goes back [to] [and i] _uh uh_ [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] being _able to_ display your [uh] your ideas [you know] [the] [what the] country stands [on] america stands [on] _is_ [that] [they] can [do] [that] [uh ,] though [i] _would_ _never_ even consider [it] [in a] million years [to] [do] [it] myself [i] [i] [i think] [uh you know] _but_ [i] [i] still [what _the] flag_ stands [for] [i guess] [to] _me_ _is_ [that if] somebody wants [to] voice [their] opinion or display [their] opinion openly [and] [if] [that] _is_ [a] [a] _way_ [that] [they] can show [their] opinion then [they [should] be] allowed [uh] 
B|44| M: [yeah _,] [yeah_ .] 
A|45| A: unless [the] burn unless [the] actual fire hinders somebody's health [and] well-being [you know] _but_ [i] _i think that's_ [i guess] [that's] [i] [that's] [my] opinion _yeah [i_ guess] [you] feel differently . 
B|46| M: [yeah _i] don't_ [, i] don [, i] [, [i] think] _, [uh_ _,] _uh_ i_ don'member [the] _, the_ _burning_ [of [the] flag ,] 
A|47| A: [uh ,] _no_ _but_ _i think that's_ [that's] [uh] [it's] [that's] taxpayer's money . [if] somebody buys [their] own [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] [that's] fine _but_ [that] [that's] [you know] [that's] destruction [and] [of] [uh] public property [and] whatever . 
B|48| M: [well [,] [that's] true] . 
A|49| A: _no_ [i don't [know] [i] guess] [the] symbolism [oh] [i think] [what] america stands [for] _is_ [the right _to] _be_ able to_ disagree [with] _the government_ . 
B|50| M: _right ._ 
A|51| A: [uh _i think] that's_ what's made democracy 
B|52| M: [yeah .] 
A|53| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [yeah .] [well] [that's] [that's true] 
B|54| M: [uh ,] 
A|55| A: [yeah] _but_ [i think] [i] [i] [yeah i] [i] [i guess] [the] idea [you know] [they] _always_ keep [saying] like [the] framers . um . [there] [uh] _one_ [of the] republican [the] appointees [for] [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] _always_ talk [about] [they] feel [that] this person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set down . 
B|56| M: uh-hue 
A|57| A: [and] um [i] believe _that the_ idea [of] [burning] [the flag] _is_ _is_ [in] 
B|58| M: [uh ,] [what] [do _you] think [of_ the] civil war ? 
A|59| A: [my] understanding [of] how _it was_ framed _is_ [that] [you] this [the] _thing_ [about] this country _is_ [that] [you] can disagree [with] its _government_ [and] [you] can display _that ._ 
B|60| M: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: [uh , i] [yeah , i] [and] [and] [so] [that] [as] [a] _freedom of_ expression [and] _speech_ [and] whatever [i] [i think that] [that's] viable . um [as] long [as] [it's] your [flag] [and] [and] you've made your your _point . [i_ think] . [yeah] because , realistically , like [for you] [for you] [you] _don't think_ [it's] [right] 
B|62| M: _no _,_ i don't_ [. i] donno [. _i] mean [,_ i] [, [i] think] [it would] [be] good [if] [it was _a] ,_ [a] [flag] [that] said [freedom of speech] , 
A|63| A: [and i] [would] _never_ [do] [it . i] [i] love this country [too] [much] [, and] [that] symbol means [a lot] [to] _me ._ 
B|64| M: _right ._ 
A|65| A: um . _but_ [i guess] [it's just] _one_ [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] [that's] what's something [it's] [a] need [for] _them_ [you [know] .] 
B|66| M: [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [yeah .] yes . _no ._ 
B|68| M: [and] _, [uh_ _, i] don't [know_ [,] i] [, [i] think that's] [one] [thing] [that's] important . 
A|69| A: [right .] [yeah [.] uh] huh . 
B|70| M: [uh [,] [and] _i] don't think [that_ [the] government] [should] _, [uh_ _,] [uh_ ,] excuse [me] , excuse [me .] [the] _, the_ _, the_ power structure [of the] united states [is] not [as] _, [uh_ [uh] ,] [as] powerful [as] [it] [should be] . 
A|71| A: [uh] huh . 
B|72| M: [and [i] don't] [want] [them] [to] [have to] live [here] . 
A|73| A: [yeah .] 
B|74| M: [and] _, [uh_ ,] [i'm] not [sure] [what the] colors were _, but_ _, [uh_ .] 
A|75| A: [i agree] [there] _too [._ [i] agree with] [you] [there] _too [._ i] [i] [the] um [i] [i] [it's] [i] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting [but] [i don't think [that] [i] don't think that] [uh] [we] [have a] [right to] stop somebody from [that] [you know] 
B|76| M: [no .] 
A|77| A: [the same] [i don't [know] [i] guess] [i] get [i] get [uh] all mixed [up] inside . when [, yeah] 
B|78| M: [yeah [.] i] [do] , [too .] 
A|79| A: [it] when [it's] [uh] [it's] [an] emotional issue [, and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] _about it_ logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] [say] [to] yourself now emotionally this [is] [a] disgusting [thing] [, uh] [but] logically um even [you know] [for] instance [, the] pro life pro choice movement [, uh you know [i] don't know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [, but] [they] [would] [vote] pro choice . 
B|80| M: [uh [,] [that's] true] . 
A|81| A: because [you know] [that's] [just] [a] disgusting [thing] [you know] somebody [an] abortion means [it's] somebody's [in] trouble [and] [that] [it's] [an] awful [thing] [, you know] 
B|82| M: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: [but] [yeah .] [but] [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] [what] [i mean ,] see [, but] [but] realistically when [you think of] [it] [it] [just] sounds like such [an] awful [thing] [, and] [it] evokes [an] emotional response [. [i] think [that's] the] hardest [thing] [, i don't know] [if] [i] could ever [be] [a] judge , because _some_ things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|84| M: uh-hugs . 
A|85| A: [no ,] [no] [i think] [the] um sometimes [i guess] [what] did [i] read recently [the] um [the] [uh] christian [uh] _point_ [is] [is] _always_ [the] _point_ [of] [well] [it's] at conception [but] then um [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception [is] [a] biblical term . [and] [there's] [no] concept [of] conception [in] medicine or biology . 
B|86| M: [uh ,] i've heard [of] [that .] 
A|87| A: [so] then [that] [so] [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion then . [so] [it's] [i don't know .] [it's] very [it's] [it's] [uh you know] [it's] [a] [it's] [a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] [really] something how um political ideas [and] viewpoints within [one] country can vary [so] [much] [and] also within um within [a ,] 
B|88| M: [uh [,] well [,] that's] [a] good [point . [i] guess] i've [never] [really] [thought] [about it] [that] [way] . i've [just] [always] [thought] [that] maybe [there] [are] [some] boundaries [that] we're not supposed [to be] drawn [on] [. [i] mean] [that] maybe [we] [should [be] able to] separate [them] . 
A|89| A: [yeah] [and] how [yeah] how it'll sway from [one] [one] extreme [to] another . 
B|90| M: [right] , exactly . 
A|91| A: [uh [i think] that] [uh you know i] [i] [just] read something [i think] [in] time magazine [uh] [about] um protest
