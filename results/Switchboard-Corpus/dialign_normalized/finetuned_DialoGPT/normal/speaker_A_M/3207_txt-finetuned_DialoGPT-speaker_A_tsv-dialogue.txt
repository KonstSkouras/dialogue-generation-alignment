A|1| A: his grandmother too _and they're_ _that_ her son his uncle whatever _you know_ anyway . he he _has_ he's recently retired _and_ _so_ he's _the_ one who _she_ moved _in_ _with_ when _she_ had _a_ stroke _and and_ all _the_ _other_ children _are_ working or whatever . 
B|2| M:  !!!!!! % !! _that's_ right . 
A|3| A: _they're_ all my parents age . _and_ _uh_ _so_ he's got _you know_ his retirement though _is_ [really] twenty-four hours _a_ day . they _have_ _a_ day care _two_ days _a_ week . they call _it_ senior citizen day care . _but_ _she_ goes _in_ _the_ senior citizen center . 
B|4| M: huh . 
A|5| A: _so_ he gets _a_ break _two_ days _a_ week _but_ it's only for _like_ _two_ or three hours _at_ _a_ time . 
B|6| M: wow . 
A|7| A: _and_ _you know_ _just_ _you_ see _a_ lot of _things_ _like_ _you _you_ know_ _was_ _a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play golf when he retired _and_ _you know_ _that_ _a_ lot of _the_ _things_ he thought he _would_ _do_ when he retired he's _not_ able _to_ _do_ now . 
B|8| M: _yeah_ . 
A|9| A: _but_ he refuses _to_ consider any _other_ _i_ _don't_ 
B|10| M: _well_ [i] _think_ _i mean_ there [are] [so] many [other] [things] [that] [uh] [you] [just] _can't_ [do] [and _and] i_ don's _i _i'm not_ really_ sure _what_ [the] answer [is] . 
A|11| A: [yeah] [and] [is] [that] _how_ your parents _feel_ or 
B|12| M: [yeah] . 
A|13| A: uh-huh . 
B|14| M: she's [not] real _good_ _about_ keeping _up with_ [things] . 
A|15| A: uh-huh . 
B|16| M: [and] [she] [has] [two] kids [and they're] [you know] [they're] grown _and everything_ _but _i_ mean_ [they're] still [in] school _and i'm_ [like] no [i] won't no 
A|17| A: _i know_ _at_ _this_ _i know_ [i] _feel_ [like] [i] _would_ never [do] [that] [with] my parents either [you know] . [but i] [i] [really] _feel_ bad for [the] _people_ [i] see [not] very [i'm not really] [really] experienced [but] [like] [i] said [i] [just] _have_ [that] one family [and i] [just] [really] _feel_ bad for [the] guy who his whole life [is] different now [and] than he thought _it_ _would be_ . [but] 
B|18| M: [yeah] . [i] _think_ _that's a_ _that's_ _probably_ true . [i] [you you] _probably_ [feel] better [you] [don't] _you ?_ 
A|19| A: [yeah] [and] he's got [you know] seven brothers [and] sisters [and and] [uh] he's [the] one because he's [the] one [that] isn't going _to_ work every day [and] [that] [she] moved [in] [with] when [she] needed _to_ move [in] [with] someone . [and] 
B|20| M: _oh_ _that's_ sad . 
A|21| A: [oh] [well] [that's] great . 
B|22| M: [yeah] . 
A|23| A: [that's a] [good] idea . we ought _to_ [yeah] [and] maybe when [the] [other] brothers [and] sisters retire or whatever [i] [don't] [know] [what] [they're] going _to_ [do] . it's [really] [not] my family . it's my fiancee's [so] [i] [don't] [i] [can't] say much . 
B|24| M: [well] [i know] [uh] . 
A|25| A: [but i] always [feel] [like] [i] _would_ never put my parents [in] either [and i] wonder [i'm] going _to be_ [the] only sibling [that] isn't going _to_ _have_ children [so] if my parents [do] need _to_ live [with] someone _it_ will [probably] _be_ [with] me because all my brothers [and] sisters will _be_ having teenagers around [and everything] _to_ care for . [you know] 
B|26| M: right . 
A|27| A: [and _i'm] i_ [that's] fine [with] me . my fiancee [and i] both figure [that's] what's we're going _to_ end [up with] both of [the] parents or whoever . if [you know] [what] [i mean] ? we [feel] [like] it's our responsibility 
B|28| M: [yeah] . 
A|29| A: [and i] [feel] [like] [i] _would_ never put them _in a_ _home_ . [but i] wonder _how_ much [you know] if one of us [is] going _to_ _have to_ quit work someday or retire early or something . 
B|30| M: [well] [you you] [would be] surprised [at] [how] many [people] [that] [are] staying [home] you'd _think_ . 
A|31| A: [you] [think] [about] _it_ [and] it's [really] [i] [don't] [know] . _this_ country kind of takes [the] worst care of [the] elderly of any [other] country . 
B|32| M: right . 
A|33| A: [and] it's [really] more of [a] _um_ [like] [a] respect issue [that] [the] older older [people] [in] [other] countries [that] _i've_ been _to_ seem _to_ [really] _have_ [a] lot more respect for [the] elderly [people] [and and] they [really] seem as wise [and and] [in] _this_ country nobody [really] [yeah] nobody [really] pays attention 
B|34| M: [yeah] . 
A|35| A: [and] they [oh] [the] old-timer made [with] [the] old way [and] nobody respects [the] traditions . [and] [you know] it's [i i'm not] saying [that] [i] [do] either [but] [you know] it's [just] funny 
B|36| M: [well] [i] guess [i'm [i] mean] [i] [it] [i've] [i] [was] raised [in a] generation [that] didn't [have] [this] [you you] _don't [have_ [to] be] [so] [um] . 
A|37| A: [and and] we [really] [don't have] any [that] [don't have] [the] social security [and everything] [really] isn't [that] much for elderly [people] [to] live on . 
B|38| M: right right . 
A|39| A: [you know] even if [they're] [in] [good] health it's incredible . 
B|40| M: right right . 
A|41| A: they [don't have] any they [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe they should [you know] because we're all going [to] get old someday . 
B|42| M: [yeah] [i] agree [with] [you] there . 
A|43| A: [and] [so] it's [a] it's kind of [a] depressing topic though . [how] old [are] [you ?] 
B|44| M: [i'm] [i'm] twenty-eight . 
A|45| A: [so] _it is_ [yeah] [and] [it] must [be] rough for [you] too [to] see your grandmother . 
B|46| M: [yeah] [it is] .
