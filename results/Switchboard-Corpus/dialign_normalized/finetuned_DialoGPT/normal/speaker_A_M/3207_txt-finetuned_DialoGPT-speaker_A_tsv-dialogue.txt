B|4| M: huh . 
A|5| A: _so_ he gets _a_ break _two_ days _a_ week _but_ it's only for _like_ _two_ or three hours _at_ _a_ time . 
B|6| M: wow . 
A|7| A: _and _,_ you know ,_ _just_ _, you_ see _a_ lot of _things_ _like_ _you _, you_ know ,_ _was_ _a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play golf when he retired _, and_ _you know_ _that_ _a_ lot of _the_ _things_ he thought he _would_ _do_ when he retired he's _not_ able _to_ _do_ now .

B|18| M: [yeah] . [i] _think_ _that's _a_ _,_ that's_ _probably_ true . [i [,] [you] , you] _probably_ [feel] better [, you] [don't] _you ?_ 
A|19| A: _yeah [,_ and] he's got [, you know ,] seven brothers [and] sisters [and [, and] [,] uh ,] he's [the] one because he's [the] one [that] isn't going _to_ work every day [and] [that] [she] moved [in] [with] when [she] needed _to_ move [in] [with] someone . [and ,] 
B|20| M: _oh _,_ that's_ sad . 
A|21| A: [oh ,] [well [,] that's] great . 
B|22| M: [yeah] . 
A|23| A: [that's a] [good] idea . we ought _to_ , _yeah [,_ and] maybe when [the] [other] brothers [and] sisters retire or whatever [, i] [don't] [know] [what] [they're] going _to_ [do] . it's [really] [not] my family . it's my fiancee's [so] [i] [don't] [, i] [can't] say much . 
B|24| M: [well [,] i [know] [,] uh] . 
A|25| A: [but i] always [feel] [like] [i] _would_ never put my parents [in] either [and i] wonder [, i'm] going _to be_ [the] only sibling [that] isn't going _to_ _have_ children [so] if my parents [do] need _to_ live [with] someone _, it_ will [probably] _be_ [with] me because all my brothers [and] sisters will _be_ having teenagers around [and everything] _to_ care for . [you know ,] 
B|26| M: right . 
A|27| A: [and _i'm] [, i_ [,] that's] fine [with] me . my fiancee [and i] both figure [that's] what's , we're going _to_ end [up with] both of [the] parents or whoever . if [you know] [what] [i mean] ? we [feel] [like ,] it's our responsibility , 
B|28| M: [yeah] . 
A|29| A: [and i] [feel] [like] [i] _would_ never put them _in a_ _home_ . [but i] wonder _how_ much [, you know ,] if one of us [is] going _to_ _have to_ quit work someday or retire early or something . 
B|30| M: [well [,] [you] , you] [would be] surprised [at] [how] many [people] [that] [are] staying [home] , you'd _think_ . 
A|31| A: [you] [think] [about] _it_ [and] it's [really] [, i] [don't] [know] . _this_ country kind of takes [the] worst care of [the] elderly of any [other] country . 
B|32| M: right . 
A|33| A: [and ,] it's [really] more of [a _,] um_ , [like] [a] respect issue [that] [the] older , older [people] [in] [other] countries [that] _i've_ been _to_ seem _to_ [really] _have_ [a] lot more respect for [the] elderly [people] [and , and] they [really] seem as wise [and , and] [in] _this_ country nobody [really] , _yeah ,_ nobody [really] pays attention 
B|34| M: [yeah] . 
A|35| A: [and] they , [oh ,] [the] old-timer made [with] [the] old way [and] nobody respects [the] traditions . [and [,] you know ,] it's [i , i'm not] saying [that] [i] [do] either [but] [you know ,] it's [just] funny

B|40| M: right , right . 
A|41| A: they [don't have] any , they [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe they should [, you know] because we're all going [to] get old someday . 
B|42| M: [yeah [,] i] agree [with] [you] there . 
A|43| A: [and] [so] it's [a ,] it's kind of [a] depressing topic though . [how] old [are] [you ?] 
B|44| M: [i'm [,] i'm] twenty-eight . 
A|45| A: [so] _it is_ , [yeah [,] and] [it] must [be] rough for [you] too [to] see your grandmother .
