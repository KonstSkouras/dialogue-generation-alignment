A|44| A: _i was_ [a] student [there] [and] spent um [a] semester studying abroad _in_ london . 
B|45| M: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: [and] [that] _was_ [a] great time [because] _it's_ [so] [that's] such [a] _neat_ place [and] _it's_ there's _not_ [a] language barrier [so] _you_ don't [i mean] [there] there's [a little] bit [because] there's some [of] those english words [that] _you_ just don't exactly _know_ [what] they [mean] [and _a] lot_ [of] people [have] trouble wrestling _with_ their accents [but] _it's it_ _was_ [really] fun [. _i] _i_ i_ [really] enjoyed [that] _. i'm_ probably _going_ back [there] [to] work _for _a_ year_ .

A|48| A: _it_ _it's_ [really nice [.] _i] would i would_ spend _all_ _my_ time _in_ london or most [of] _my_ time 
B|49| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [and] [that's] _it_ _was_ [really] different being _in_ [a] big city [because] [i] don't get much into _urban_ _you know_ [really] _urban_ areas _a lot_ 
B|51| M:  !!!!!! % !! remind _me_ [of] [that] [that] [i] used [to] [do [a] lot] more [urban] exploring [when [i] was] younger _and i_ didn't [have to] drive [as] far [as] _i did_ now [because] [my] car [was] [so] old

B|53| M: [right .] 
A|54| A: _you_ could just [kind of] [kind of] walk around [and] observe 
B|55| M: [right .] 
A|56| A: [i did] [a lot] [of] just _going_ [out] by myself [and] riding [on] _the_ subway [and] watching people . 
B|57| M: [oh] how [neat] . 
A|58| A: [and i] had [a] great time doing [that] . _it_ [was] [really] interesting . 
B|59| M: [oh .] 
A|60| A: [yeah] [i] _know_ 
B|61| M: [and [i] would i would] _love to [go_ to] [the] east coast [you know i] _love to_ travel 
A|62| A: [i] keep wanting [to] get up [to] [i haven't] [i haven't been] anywhere else outside _the united states [._ [i] haven't been] [to] mexico or canada or 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [oh .] 
B|65| M: [and [uh] we] [lived] [there] _for a while_ [and then] [we] moved [to] dallas _about [a_ year] [and a] half [ago] 
A|66| A: [yeah that] [would] _be_ [nice [.] i] had [a] friend from [there] . 
B|67| M: [oh] [yeah] [and [i] [i] would] [like] [to [go] to] spain . 
A|68| A: [then] [i] i'd [love to go] somewhere _in_ asia [but] i'd [have _to] [have_ a] tour guide _with_ [me] [to] help _with_ _all_ [the] language [and] _all_ [that] . 
B|69| M: [oh] that'd [be] [neat] . 
A|70| A: [so] [yeah] [that's] why [that's] why england [was] [nice .] even [we] traveled _in_ europe [for] [about a] week [and] [that] [was] even [nice] [because] [there] wasn't [uh] [the] most [the] places [we] went [we] went [to] germany [and] switzerland [and] 
B|71| M: [uh] [i'm] [not] sure if [you] [have] any children [in [the] united states .] 
A|72| A: [yeah] [we have] . [we] . [we] [did] [we] whirlwinded through europe . 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: _it_ [was] just insane twelve days where we'd just stop [like] [a] city [a] day [and] [you] slept [on] [the] train at night . 
B|75| M: uh-hue . 
A|76| A: [but] [there] wasn't [a] _it_ [was] strange _it_ [was] [kind of] sad [there] wasn't ever [a] language _problem_ [there] [because] everyone [in] germany knew english [and] everyone [in] switzerland knew english . 
B|77| M: uh-hau uh-hue . 
A|78| A: [so we] were [kind of] pitiful . [we] found [one] restaurant [we] were [in] [and] [got] seated [and then] [no] [one] knew english [in] [there] [and] [we] were just finally had [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking up things . 
B|79| M: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [but] _it_ [was] 
B|81| M: [uh] 
A|82| A: [oh] [i] had fondue . [that] [was] easy [to] say 
B|83| M: [oh .] 
A|84| A: tried [to] get fondue [and] white wine [and] [that] [was] 
B|85| M: [okay .] [uh] first [of] [all] [what] type [of] painting [do] [you] [do] ? 
A|86| A: [we] were able _to have_ [that] pretty pretty effortlessly . [there] were some people at [the] next [table] who spoke english [so we] elicited their aid [for a while] 
B|87| M: [oh .] 
A|88| A: [and] they were very helpful 
B|89| M: uh-hue . 
A|90| A: [so] _it_ [was] _it_ [was] [a] pleasant time . 
B|91| M: [yeah .] 
A|92| A: i'd i'd [love to go] back [there] . there's just [not] time there's [not] enough time [to go] see everything [and then] [to] afford [to] see everything . 
B|93| M: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [right .] [that's] 
B|95| M: [yeah .] 
A|96| A: [that] [and] sleeping late 
B|97| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [i] keep hoping [for] . 
B|99| M: [yeah] [it's it] [is] [a real] [problem] [. i'm] [not] sure how [long] [it's] [going] [to] [last] [but] [you know] we've [got] [we have] [got [to] have] something . 
A|100| A: [well] [it] [was] _nice talking with you_ . 
B|101| M: [nice talking with you] [too] . 
A|102| A: [and] [have a] good afternoon . 
B|103| M: [you] [too] . 
A|104| A: [okay .]
