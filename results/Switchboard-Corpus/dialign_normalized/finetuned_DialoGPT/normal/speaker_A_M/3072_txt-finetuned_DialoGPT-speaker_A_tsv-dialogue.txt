B|21| M: _so [,_ that] [is] [a] new experience _for_ them .

B|25| M: [oh [,] that's] _really nice ._ 
A|26| A: _it's_ [really] _, really_ pretty [. _i] was_ [a little] kid _then_ _, and_ [we] _to have_ [, uh , we] stayed at some park [and] they had [a little] [uh ,] mountain man who came down _the_ river every night _, and_ he _would_ give [a little] talk _about_ mountain things . _you know , i_ think he wasn't [a real] mountain man _, but_ [we] were pretty convinced he _was_ [a] full , hermit who _lived_ up _in_ , _the_ woods [, that] he'd come _in_ his [little] log boat down _the_ river , 
B|27| M: uh-hue . 
A|28| A: [and] [we] _would_ _have to_ , we'd [and] he'd make sassafras tea [out] [of] sassafras roots [that] he'd found [and [,] that's] [a] good family place _to go_ , 
B|29| M: _yeah ._ 
A|30| A: _and then_ _the_ river _was_ [really nice] [because] _it_ wasn't _too_ frightening _, but_ _it_ wasn't _, you know ,_ _too_ easy either . 
B|31| M: _yeah ._ 
A|32| A: _it_ _was_ [like] , 
B|33| M: _yeah ._ 
A|34| A: [that's] true . 
B|35| M: [so] . 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] _right ._ 
B|37| M:  !!!!,!! et !! remind _me_ . 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| M: [and , uh [,] so] [that] [, that] [, uh] ... 
A|40| A: [well [,] that's] good . [well [,] [we] ,] um , let's see , _the_ only other place [i've] ever vacationed , we'd _, you know ,_ _go_ [on] camping trips up [to] texoma [and] things [like] [that] . 
B|41| M: uh-uh . 
A|42| A: _and then_ [i] went [to] england [a] few years _ago_ . 
B|43| M: [oh [,] really] ? 
A|44| A: _i was_ [a ,] student [there] [and] spent , um , [a] semester studying abroad _in_ london . 
B|45| M: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: [and] [that] _was_ [a] great time [, because] _it's_ [so [,] that's] such [a] _neat_ place [and] _it's ,_ there's _not_ [a] language barrier [so] _you_ don't [, [i] mean ,] [there] there's [a little] bit [, because] there's some [of] those english words [that] _you_ just don't exactly _know_ [what] they [mean _,] [and_ _a] lot_ [of] people [have] trouble wrestling _with_ their accents _, but_ _it's , it_ _was_ [really] fun [. _i] , _i_ , i_ [really] enjoyed [that] _. i'm_ probably _going_ back [there] [to] work , _for _a_ year_ . 
B|47| M: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: _it_ _, it's_ [really nice [.] _i] would , i would_ spend _all_ _my_ time _in_ london , or most [of] _my_ time , 
B|49| M: [uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|50| A: [and] [that's] _it_ _was_ [really] different being _in_ [a] big city [, because] [i] don't get much into _urban_ _, you know [,_ really] _urban_ areas _a lot_ 
B|51| M:  !!!!,!! % !! remind _me_ [of] [that] [, that] [, i] used [to] [do [a] lot] more [urban] exploring [when [i] was] younger [, _and] i_ didn't [have to] drive [as] far [as] _i did_ now [, because] [my] car [was] [so] old , 
A|52| A: [and] _it_ [was] _, it's_ [really] _, it's_ sort [of] [a] weird [little] anonymous feeling where [no] [one] knows who _you_ are [and] _you_ can spend [a] whole day without _talking_ [to] anyone , which [i] thought _i would_ just hate _, but_ _it_ ended up being [kind of] [nice] [because] you're _not_ accountable [to] anyone . 
B|53| M: [right .] 
A|54| A: _you_ could just [kind of] [kind of] walk around [and] observe , 
B|55| M: [right .] 
A|56| A: [i did] [a lot] [of] just _going_ [out] by myself [and] riding [on] _the_ subway [and] watching people . 
B|57| M: [oh ,] how [neat] . 
A|58| A: [and i] had [a] great time doing [that] . _it_ [was] [really] interesting . 
B|59| M: [oh .] 
A|60| A: [yeah [,] i] _know ,_ 
B|61| M: [and [i] would , i would] _love to [go_ to] [the] east coast [, [you know ,] i] _love to_ travel , 
A|62| A: [i] keep wanting [to] get up [to] [, i haven't] [, i haven't been] anywhere else outside _the united states [._ [i] haven't been] [to] mexico or canada or , 
B|63| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [oh .] 
B|65| M: [and [, uh ,] we] [lived] [there] _for a while_ _, and then_ [we] moved [to] dallas _about [a_ year] [and a] half [ago] 
A|66| A: [yeah , that] [would] _be_ [nice [.] i] had [a] friend from [there] . 
B|67| M: [oh [,] yeah [,] [and] [i] [, i] would] [like] [to [go] to] spain . 
A|68| A: [then] [i ,] i'd [love to go] somewhere _in_ asia _, but_ i'd [have _to] [have_ a] tour guide _with_ [me] [to] help _with_ _all_ [the] language [and] _all_ [that] . 
B|69| M: [oh ,] that'd [be] [neat] . 
A|70| A: [so [,] yeah [,] that's] why [, that's] why england [was] [nice .] even [, we] traveled _in_ europe [for] [about a] week [, and] [that] [was] even [nice] [because] [there] wasn't [, uh ,] [the] , most [the] places [we] went [, we] went [to] germany [and] switzerland [and ,] 
B|71| M: [uh ,] [i'm] [not] sure if [you] [have] any children [in [the] united states .] 
A|72| A: [yeah [,] we have] . [we] . [we] [did] [, we] whirlwinded through , europe . 
B|73| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: _it_ [was] just insane twelve days where we'd just stop [like] [a] city [a] day [, and] [you] slept [on] [the] train at night . 
B|75| M: uh-hue . 
A|76| A: [but] [there] wasn't [a _,] it_ [was] strange _, it_ [was] [kind of] sad , [there] wasn't ever [a] language _problem_ [there [,] because] everyone [in] germany knew english [and] everyone [in] switzerland , knew english . 
B|77| M: uh-hau , uh-hue . 
A|78| A: [so we] were [kind of] pitiful . [we] found [one] restaurant [we] were [in] [and] [got] seated [, and then] [no] [one] knew english [in] [there [,] and] [we] were just finally had [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking up things . 
B|79| M: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [but] _it_ [was] , 
B|81| M: [uh ,] 
A|82| A: [oh [,] i] had fondue . [that] [was] easy [to] say 
B|83| M: [oh .] 
A|84| A: tried [to] get fondue [and] white wine [, and] [that] [was] , 
B|85| M: [okay .] [uh ,] first [of] [all] , [what] type [of] painting [do] [you] [do] ? 
A|86| A: [we] were able _to have_ [that] pretty , pretty effortlessly . [there] were some people at [the] next [table] who spoke english [, so we] elicited their aid [for a while] 
B|87| M: [oh .] 
A|88| A: [and ,] they were very helpful 
B|89| M: uh-hue . 
A|90| A: [so _,] it_ [was] _, it_ [was] [a] pleasant time . 
B|91| M: [yeah .] 
A|92| A: i'd , i'd [love to go] back [there] . there's just [not] time there's [not] enough time [to go] see everything [, and then] [to] afford [to] see everything . 
B|93| M: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [right .] [that's] 
B|95| M: [yeah .] 
A|96| A: [that] [and] sleeping late 
B|97| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [i] keep hoping [for] . 
B|99| M: [yeah [,] [it's] , it] [is] [a real] [problem] [. i'm] [not] sure how [long] [it's] [going] [to] [last] [, but] [, you know ,] we've [got] [, we have] [got [to] have] something . 
A|100| A: [well] [it] [was] _nice talking with_ [you] . 
B|101| M: [nice talking with] [, you] [too] . 
A|102| A: [and] [have a] good afternoon . 
B|103| M: [you] [too] .
