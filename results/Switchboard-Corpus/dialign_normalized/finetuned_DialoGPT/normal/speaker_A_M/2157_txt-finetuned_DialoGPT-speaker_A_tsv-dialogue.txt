B|14| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|15| A: [well] _he_ could _always_ get past _you know_ he'd get past [like] six or seven tackles _and_ _just_ keep spinning around _and_ get _on_ into [the] end zone . [but] um _i guess_ _you_ _never_ could [really] _see_ _him_ play because with _the cowboys_ _while_ _he was_ with [the] [team] [the] rest _of the_ [team] [was] [pretty] poor _so_ _you_ couldn't [really] tell if _it_ [was] _just_ _him_ or [the] [team] _and _i_ always_ _just_ assumed [that] _he was_ _too_ [good] _for the_ rest _of the_ [team] . _but _i_ don't _know_ ._

A|21| A: did _he_ did _he_ actually play _in_ [the] pro bowl [. i] remember _he was_ [like] [a] backup _and_ then somebody got injured _and_ _he was_ supposed [to] go . 
B|22| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|23| A: [yeah i] kind [of] [i] haven't [been] _keeping_ up with football [i] mean _in_ [the] fall [i i] can go _on_ _and_ _on_ [about] football [but] since _it's_ kind [of] off season _it's_ kind [of] hard [to] _think_ back [about] _all_ [that] . [but uh] 
B|24| M: [yeah] 
A|25| A: [yeah .] 
B|26| M: _they _they_ had_ [uh] _they _had_ _a_ a_ _guy_ _that was_ _in there_ [for a while] [who] [uh] [he was a] [he was] an assistant coach [at] _one time_ [for the] minnesota minnesota twins . 
A|27| A: um [i] have _no_ idea . 
B|28| M: [he's] [uh] [he's] [the] assistant coach [for the] new orleans raiders .

B|38| M: [yeah .] 
A|39| A: _just_ hadn't [heard] much [about] them lately . 
B|40| M: [no] . 
A|41| A: _yeah . well_ _the cardinals_ _i don't [know_ [.] _i] think_ _the cowboys_ probably have [a a] [better team] [. they] _just_ [at] [the] end [of the] season [the] kind [of] got messed up with aikman getting hurt because [uh] laufenberg _just_ couldn't ever [really] get [it] together _at all ._ [of] course [he] sat along [the] sidelines _all_ season [he] [never] [really] got [in] [a] game [never] did [a] whole [lot] . 
B|42| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|43| A: [well] _i'm_ _just_ saying [i] shouldn't [i] shouldn't blast [him] [like] [that] say [oh] [well] laufenberg got _out_ [there] _and_ blew [it] [for] them [i] mean [he] [didn't] get [to] _see_ much action . [but] _too_ bad . because _now_ _now_ [you know] [he] [had a] shot _and_ _and_ [didn't] look _too_ [good] _and_ [so] [no] one's [going to] have much faith [in] [him] _any_ more . 
B|44| M: _right_ . 
A|45| A: [in] fact _i think_ [they're] getting [a] different [guy] [for a] backup quarterback [. i] haven't _uh i_ haven't kept up with [it] lately _but i_ remember reading something [a] few months ago [about] them signing somebody else _on_ or or trying [to] go after somebody or trade [for] somebody [but] [it] wasn't anybody i'd [really] [heard of] . _but i_ [heard] _on_ [the] radio this morning or yesterday morning [that] [uh] aikman's back [in] practicing [doing real] [real] [well] . um [who] is [it] michael irvin 
B|46| M: [uh _i] can't_ [think] [of the] guy's name . 
A|47| A: [he] said [that] [uh] aikman [was] hitting [him] [right] _on_ [the] numbers every _time ._ [so] sounds [like] [he's] [going to be] _all_ [right] [for] next season [. they're] _just_ trying [not] [to] overwork [him] [right] _now_ until [he] gets his shoulder [uh] back [in] [it] [was] his shoulder wasn't [it] [that] [he] [had] [the] problems with ? 
B|48| M: [right] . 
A|49| A: _i think_ [it] _i think_ [it] [was] his shoulder [he] [had] surgery _on_ . [but] _anyway_ [they're] trying [to] keep [him] [you know] keep [him] [uh] _from_ reinjuring anything [but] _anyway_ 
B|50| M: [yeah [i] don't [i] i] [know] [i guess] [i'm] [a] _big_ _dallas_ _fan_ _i'm not_ [a] _big_ _cowboy fan_ [at all .] 
A|51| A: thirty _day notice for_ what ? 
B|52| M: [day notice for] _having_ [your] car checked [out] . 
A|53| A: [oh really] . 
B|54| M: [yeah .] 
A|55| A: what . [oh] _okay_ maybe i'll call [you] back after after [the] recording is finished . actually _i think_ we have talked [about] football [for] five minutes [. [i] can't] remember . 
B|56| M: [yeah] [okay .] 
A|57| A: [really] [. i] usually have _too_ . 
B|58| M: [i [i] [i] don't know] [i think] _i've_ [i] _do_ [i always] [i just] _i'm not_ [real good] [at] [keeping] track [of] [time .] 
A|59| A: [yeah] [i've] done [that] once or twice [. i] [didn't] look [at] [the] clock [when] we started [talking] [so] [i guess] we should talk [about] football [a] little bit longer [just] [to be] [sure] we got five minutes [in] . 
B|60| M: [right] . [right] . 
A|61| A: [yeah .] [so] [other] than [the] vikings [who] [do] [you] [like] ? 
B|62| M: [well i] [like the] packers [. i] [like] _dallas_ . 
A|63| A: [uh] [oh] . 
B|64| M: [but [uh] i] _i'm not_ [a] _big_ [uh] 
A|65| A: [yeah .] 
B|66| M: [but [uh] i] [like] [to] watch [the cardinals] [and i] [like the] giants [too] [but i] [like] philadelphia . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] back [when] [they were] [in] _saint louis_ ? 
B|68| M: [yeah [i] i] _used [to_ be] [a] _big_ [saint louis] [cardinals] _fan_ 
A|69| A: since [they've] [been] [to] phoenix [they] haven't [been] [uh] [all] [that] impressive [i guess] [. [i] guess] [i've] [always] [been] [a] [cowboy fan] . [other] than [that] [i] mean [you know] [when] [i've] [you know] [when] [you] grow up [in] [a] city [that] has [the] [you know] [one] [of the] greatest football teams until [the] [last] few _years_ [you] kind [of] tend [to] get caught up [in] [it .] 
B|70| M: [yeah . well] you've [uh] you've [had] _some_ [good] _years ._ 
A|71| A: [yeah .] 
B|72| M: _and now_ [uh] [you know .] 
A|73| A: [yeah i] mean [it] [it] [was] [really] exciting growing up [when] [when] _the cowboys_ [were] [really] [big] . because _my_ parents would [always] have season tickets [and] they'd go [to] [all] [the] games [and] [you know] [the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . _it's just_ [you know] [the] [last] [oh [i] guess] probably since [about] eighty-four [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they] started kind [of] [going] downhill [really] [but] [you know] [i'm] [just] [used to] [always] growing up [and] hearing _cowboys_ _cowboys_ _cowboys_ [and] [you know] super bowl [and] [all] this [other] stuff . [so] [i can't] [you know] [i'm [not] going to] decide [i don't] [like] them [just] because [they're] [having] [a] few bad [years [.] i] mean [i think] they'll pull [out] [of] [it] [and] [you know] they'll they'll wind up being [good] again . [they've] got [some] [lot] [of] [really] [good] young players [that] are [going to] [that] are [going to] [uh] [do] [pretty good] [i think] . [but] [they're] raising prices _on_ their tickets . [so] [they're] banking _on_ [doing] [good] next season [. [i] think] tickets are 
B|74| M: [well i] don [i've] [never] bought [any] merchandise _from [the_ cowboys] [but [i] always] [like] [to] shop [anyway] . 
A|75| A: [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [i don't know] [it's just] me [and] [my] brother [and] [my] wife [and] our daughter [and] [it's] [it] seems [like] [it's] [really] [a] sad commentary [on] life [uh] 
A|77| A: thirty or thirty-two [for] [really] [good] tickets . _see_ [they they] sectioned [it] [out] even more [. they] [used to] [just] have [like] [uh] first [of] [all] [it] [was] [all] [one] price . [and] then [they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] end zone [and] then everything else . [and now] [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] [from the] [from] [one] twenty yard line [to] [the other] [one] [just] [on] [the] lower levels is [the] highest price [and] then [the] next highest price is [that] same area [but] above [it] [on] [the] upper level [and] then [like] [from the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . [and] then [they're] [some] sections kind [of] [in] [the] corner areas [and] then [the] cheapest [of] course is [going to be] [the] end [the] direct end zones . [but] um [they] have [about] four or five different prices [now] [that] [they're] structuring [it] with [but] obviously [yeah] [they're] [all] [going] up more or less is what [it's] [going to] [do] . 
B|78| M: [oh i] [see] . 
A|79| A: um [you know] [i'm [not] sure] [i'm not] positive [i] [didn't] [i] [didn't] [really] [think] [about] [that] [. [i] just] remember trying [to] figure [out] where [you] could get [that was] [real] close [to] [the] [good] section [but] [in] [the] little bit cheaper . [but] [not] [that] i'll ever go [. i] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [cowboys] game [time] [last] [time] [i] went [to] [the cowboys] game [was] during [that] um n f l strike or [the] [when] [they had] [the] scab [team] teams [in there] [and] [it] [was] [the] [uh] [dallas] [and] washington redskins game . [and i] went because [my] dad can usually get [a] hold [of] [some] free tickets because [a lot] [of] those doctors have season tickets [and] [they] um if [they're not going to] use them they'll give them [to] somebody else . [so] [my] dad [i] went with [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one [time] .] [but] [that] wasn't [a] [real] [you know] [it] [was] [it] [was] [the] scab teams [it] [was] kind [of] [you know] [it] [was] kind [of] different [i guess] . [and] before [that] [it's] [been] quite [a] few [years .] [i've] [been] wanting [to] go [to] [a] game [i just] [never] [never] have gotten around [to] [it .] [so] maybe this [year .] 
B|80| M: [well] that's true .
