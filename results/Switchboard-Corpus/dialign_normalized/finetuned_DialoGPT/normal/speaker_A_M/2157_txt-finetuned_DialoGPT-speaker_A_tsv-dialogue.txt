B|14| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|15| A: [well _,] he_ could _always_ get past _, _you_ _know_ ,_ he'd get past [like] six or seven tackles _and_ _just_ keep spinning around _and_ get _on_ into [the] end zone . [but ,] um _, i guess_ _you_ _never_ could [really] _see_ _him_ play , because with _the cowboys ,_ _while_ _he was_ with [the] [team] , [the] rest _of the_ [team] [was] [pretty] poor _so_ _you_ couldn't [really] tell if _it_ [was] _just_ _him_ or [the] [team] _and _i_ always_ _just_ assumed [that] _he was_ _too_ [good] _for the_ rest _of the_ [team] .

B|20| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|21| A: did _he_ , did _he_ actually play _in_ [the] pro bowl [. i] remember _he was_ [like] [a] backup _and_ then somebody got injured _and_ _he was_ supposed [to] go . 
B|22| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|23| A: [yeah , i] kind [of] [, i] haven't [been] _keeping_ up with football [, i] mean , _in_ [the] fall [i , i] can go _on_ _and_ _on_ [about] football _, but_ since _it's_ kind [of] off season _, it's_ kind [of] hard [to] _think_ back [about] _all_ [that] . [but , uh ,] 
B|24| M: [yeah] 
A|25| A: [yeah .] 
B|26| M: _they , _they_ had_ [, uh] _they _had_ _a_ , a_ _guy_ _that was_ _in there_ [for a while] [who] [, uh] [he was _a] [,_ he was] an assistant coach [at] _one time_ [for the] minnesota minnesota twins . 
A|27| A: um [, i] have _no_ idea . 
B|28| M: [he's] [, uh] [he's] [the] assistant coach [for the] new orleans raiders . 
A|29| A: _no_ earthly idea . 
B|30| M: _i've_ [never] _heard of_ [him] . 
A|31| A: how did [they] end up this [year] ? did [they ,] did [they] _make it_ [to] [the] play-offs _at all_ ? 
B|32| M: [uh _,] no_ _. [they_ [,] uh] [they] _didn't_ [make _it] ._ 
A|33| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|34| M: [so ,] 
A|35| A: kind [of] [like _the] cowboys ,_ huh . 
B|36| M: [yeah .] 
A|37| A: except _i think_ _the cowboys_ are _on_ [the] upswing _i don't know_ [about] [the] vikings 
B|38| M: [yeah .] 
A|39| A: _just_ hadn't [heard] much [about] them lately . 
B|40| M: [no] . 
A|41| A: _yeah . well ,_ _the cardinals _,_ i don't [know_ [.] _i] think_ _the cowboys_ probably have [a , a] [better team] [. they] _just ,_ [at] [the] end [of the] season , [the] kind [of] got messed up with aikman getting hurt , because [, uh ,] laufenberg _just_ couldn't ever [really] get [it] together _at all ._ [of] course [, he] sat along [the] sidelines _all_ season [, he] [never] [really] got [in] [a] game , [never] did [a] whole [lot] . 
B|42| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|43| A: [well _,] i'm_ _just_ saying [i] shouldn't [, i] shouldn't blast [him] [like] [that] , say , [oh] [well ,] laufenberg got _out_ [there] _and_ blew [it] [for] them [, i] mean [, he] [didn't] get [to] _see_ much action . [but _,] too_ bad . because _now ,_ _now [,_ [you] _know] [,_ he] [had a] shot _and_ _, and_ [didn't] look _too_ [good] _and_ [so [,] no] one's [going to] have much faith [in] [him] _any_ more . 
B|44| M: _right_ . 
A|45| A: [in] fact _, i think_ [they're] getting [a] different [guy] [for a] backup quarterback [. i] haven't _, uh , i_ haven't kept up with [it] lately _, but i_ remember reading something [a] few months ago [about] them signing somebody else _on_ , or , or trying [to] go after somebody or trade [for] somebody _, but_ [it] wasn't anybody i'd [really] [heard of] . _but i_ [heard] _on_ [the] radio this morning , or yesterday morning , [that] [, uh ,] aikman's back [in] practicing , [doing real] , [real] [well] . um , [who] is [it] , michael irvin 
B|46| M: [uh _, i] can't_ [think] [of the] guy's name . 
A|47| A: [he] said [that] [, uh ,] aikman [was] hitting [him] [right] _on_ [the] numbers every _time ._ [so ,] sounds [like] [he's] [going to be] _all_ [right] [for] next season [. they're] _just_ trying [not] [to] overwork [him] [right] _now ,_ until [he] gets his shoulder [, uh ,] back [in] [it] [was] his shoulder , wasn't [it] , [that] [he] [had] [the] problems with ? 
B|48| M: [right] . 
A|49| A: _i think_ [it] _, i think_ [it] [was] his shoulder [he] [had] surgery _on_ . [but] _anyway_ [, they're] trying [to] keep [him] [, [you] _know] ,_ keep [him] [, uh ,] _from_ reinjuring anything _, but_ _anyway_ 
B|50| M: [yeah [, i] don't , [i] , i] [know [,] i guess] [i'm] [a] _big_ _dallas_ _fan_ _, i'm not_ [a] _big_ _cowboy fan_ [at all .] 
A|51| A: thirty _day notice for_ what ? 
B|52| M: [day notice for] _having_ [your] car checked [out] . 
A|53| A: [oh , really] . 
B|54| M: [yeah .] 
A|55| A: what . [oh _,] okay_ , maybe i'll call [you] back after , after [the] recording is finished . actually _i think_ we have talked [about] football [for] five minutes [. [i] can't] remember . 
B|56| M: [yeah [,] [okay] .] 
A|57| A: [really] [. i] usually have _, too_ . 
B|58| M: [i , [i] [, i] don't know [,] i think] _i've [,_ i] _do_ [, [i] always] [, i [just] _,] i'm not_ [real good] [at] [keeping] track [of] [time .] 
A|59| A: [yeah _,] i've_ done [that] once or twice [. i] [didn't] look [at] [the] clock [when] we started [talking] , [so] [i guess] we should talk [about] football [a] little bit longer [just] [to be] [sure] we got five minutes [in] . 
B|60| M: [right] . [right] . 
A|61| A: [yeah .] [so] [other] than [the] vikings , [who] [do] [you] [like] ? 
B|62| M: [well [,] i] [like the] packers [. i] [like] _dallas_ . 
A|63| A: [uh ,] [oh] . 
B|64| M: [but [, uh ,] [i] _,] i'm not_ [a] _big_ [, uh] 
A|65| A: [yeah .] 
B|66| M: [but [, uh ,] i] [like] [to] watch [the cardinals [,] [and] i] [like the] giants [, too] [, but i] [like] philadelphia . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] back [when] [they were] [in] _saint louis_ ? 
B|68| M: [yeah , [i] , i] _used [to_ be] [a] _big_ [saint louis] [cardinals] _fan_ , 
A|69| A: since [they've] [been] [to] phoenix [they] haven't [been] [, uh ,] [all] [that] impressive [, i guess] [. [i] guess] [i've] [always] [been] [a] [cowboy fan] . [other] than [that] [, i] mean [, [you] [know] ,] [when] [i've [,] [you] [know] ,] [when] [you] grow up [in] [a] city [that] has [the] [, [you] [know] ,] [one] [of the] greatest football teams until [the] [last] few _years_ [, you] kind [of] tend [to] get caught up [in] [it .] 
B|70| M: [yeah . well ,] you've [, uh] you've [had] _some_ [good] _years ._ 
A|71| A: [yeah .] 
B|72| M: _and [now_ [,] uh] [you know .] 
A|73| A: [yeah , i] mean [it] _, it_ [was] [really] exciting , growing up [when] , [when] _the cowboys_ [were] [really] [big] . because _my_ parents would [always] have season tickets [, and] they'd go [to] [all] [the] games [, and] [you [know] ,] [the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . _it's [just_ [,] [you] [know] ,] [the] [last] , [oh] [i guess] probably since [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they] started kind [of] [going] downhill [really] [, [but] [,] [you] [know] [,] i'm] [just] [used to] [always] growing up [and] hearing _cowboys ,_ _cowboys ,_ _cowboys [,_ and] [, [you] [know] ,] super bowl [, and] [all] this [other] stuff . [so [,] i can't] [, [you] [know] [,] i'm [not] going to] decide [i don't] [like] them [just] because [they're] [having] [a] few bad [years [.] i] mean [, i think] they'll pull [out] [of] [it] [, and] [, [you] [know] ,] they'll , they'll wind up being [good] again . [they've] got [some] , [lot] [of] [really] [good] young players [that] are [going to] , [that] are [going to] [, uh ,] [do] [pretty [good] [,] i think] . [but [,] they're] raising prices _on_ their tickets . [so] [they're] banking _on_ [doing] [good] next season [. [i] think] tickets are , 
B|74| M: [well [,] i] don [, i've] [never] bought [any] merchandise _from [the_ cowboys [,] but [i] always] [like] [to] shop [anyway] . 
A|75| A: [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [i don't know [,] [it's] just] me [and] [my] brother [and] [my] wife [and] our daughter [and] [it's] [, it] seems [like] [it's] [really] [a] sad commentary [on] life [, uh] 
A|77| A: thirty , or thirty-two [for] [really] [good] tickets . _see_ [, [they] , they] sectioned [it] [out] even more [. they] [used to] [just] have [like] [, uh ,] first [of] [all] [it] [was] [all] [one] price . [and] then [they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] end zone [and] then everything else . [and now] [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] [from the] , [from] [one] twenty yard line [to] [the other] [one] , [just] [on] [the] lower levels is [the] highest price [, and] then [the] next highest price is [that] same area [but] above [it] [on] [the] upper level [, and] then [like] [from the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . [and] then [they're] [some] sections kind [of] [in] [the] corner areas [, and] then [the] cheapest [of] course is [going to be] [the] end , [the] direct end zones . [but ,] um [, they] have [about] four or five different prices [now ,] [that] [they're] structuring [it] with [, but] obviously [yeah [,] they're] [all] [going] up , more or less is what [it's] [going to] [do] . 
B|78| M: [oh [,] i] [see] . 
A|79| A: um [, [you] [know] [,] i'm [not] sure] [, i'm not] positive [, i] [didn't] [, i] [didn't] [really] [think] [about] [that] [. [i] just] remember trying [to] figure [out] where [you] could get [that was] [real] close [to] [the] [good] section [but] [in] [the] little bit cheaper . [but ,] [not] [that] i'll ever go [. i] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [cowboys] game , [time] , [last] [time] [i] went [to] [the cowboys] game [was] during [that] , um , n f l strike , or [the] , [when] [they had] [the] scab [team] , teams [in there] [, and] [it] [was] [the] [, uh ,] [dallas] [and] washington redskins game . [and i] went because [my] dad can usually get [a] hold [of] [some] free tickets , because [a lot] [of] those doctors have season tickets [, and] [they ,] um , if [they're not going to] use them they'll give them [to] somebody else . [so] [my] dad [, i] went with [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one [time] .] [but] [that] wasn't [a] [real] [, [you] [know] [,] it] [was] [, it] [was] [the] scab teams [, it] [was] kind [of] [, [you] [know] [,] it] [was] kind [of] different [, i guess] . [and] before [that] [it's] [been] quite [a] few [years .] [i've] [been] wanting [to] go [to] [a] game [, i just] [never] , [never] have gotten around [to] [it .] [so] maybe this [year .] 
B|80| M: [well ,] that's true .
