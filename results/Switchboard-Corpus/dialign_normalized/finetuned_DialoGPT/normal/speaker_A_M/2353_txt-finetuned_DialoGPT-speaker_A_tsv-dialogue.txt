B|0| M: _and _i think_ that's_ _good_ . 
A|1| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|2| M: _because_ _they're_ not _you know_ _they're_ more _um_ 
A|3| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|4| M: _but_ _the_ women _don't_ . 
A|5| A: _you know _i_ i_ _really_ _agree with you ._ [um] [i] _uh_ though i've never done _that_ myself [i] _i'm_ _was a_ basically _an_ education major when [i] graduated _from_ college [and i] accepted _a_ job _that_ _at_ [the] time _was_ _just_ slightly above [the] poverty level _to_ teach _to_ [um] _very_ rural _children_ _in_ _a very_ low income district [and i] spent _a_ year teaching _there_ 
B|6| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|7| A: [and i think] _it_ _was_ probably _one_ _of_ my largest eye-opening experiences [because] [i] come _from_ _nice_ middle class white suburban home 
B|8| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|9| A: _and i did_ _it_ [um] for _one_ reason [i] wanted [i] _was_ working _on_ _a_ masters degree _so i_ wanted _to_ stay close _to_ _where_ [i] _was_ working _on_ _a_ masters degree [but] also [because] _i just_ thought _that_ _it would be_ interesting _to_ live some place else _so_ totally different than my own up bringing 
B|10| M: [uh] . 
A|11| A: [and i] _it_ changed _it_ probably changed my political views _it_ changed my understanding _of _the_ world_ _around_ me 
B|12| M: [uh] uh-hue 
A|13| A: [and i think] [um] _in_ fact _if_ [i] had _to_ _do_ _it_ _all_ again _i [you_ know] after _that you know_ [you] never [think] _of it_ [because] _i guess_ [because] [i] paid for _all_ _of_ my college education myself [i] never thought _about_ doing _that_ [because] [i] had _all_ these college loans i'd started paying back . 
B|14| M: [uh] _yeah ._ 
A|15| A: [um] _so_ _that was_ _that was_ _one_ reason why [i] never considered _it_ [but] _now_ _that_ _i'm_ further _along_ [and] _i'm_ still paying these college loans _i [i_ think] realistically [you know] [you] can _have_ _your_ college loans delayed _now_ [because] [i] had _them_ delayed [because] _i'm_ back _in_ graduate _school_ _at_ thirty years old 
B|16| M: huh-uh . _oh_ _that's_ _that _is_ that_ [would be] that'd _be an_ ideal _situation_ . 
A|17| A: [um] [i] had _them_ delayed [because] _i'm_ back _in_ graduate _school_ [and] _on_ [that] form _it_ says _if_ _your_ joining [the] peace corps [you] can _have_ _them_ delayed 
B|18| M: _oh_ [really] ? 
A|19| A: [and i] thought _that was_ [you know] _very_ interesting [and _i] i_ [would] _have_ thought _of_ [that] earlier [i] probably [would] _have_ done [you know] _just_ _like_ [is [that] is] this [is that] [the] mormon church [that] does [that] ? 
B|20| M: [uh] 
A|21| A: [because] _one_ _of_ my neighbors [uh] _did_ [that] _in_ pittsburgh _from_ pittsburgh . 
B|22| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|23| A: [and i] thought [you know] [that] [really] _now_ [that] _i'm_ thirty years old _i think that_ _one_ _or_ two years out _of_ my life [would] _have_ probably _like_ [you] said _to be_ able _to_ travel some place else whether _it_ _be the_ united states _or_ outside [the] country [i think] _it would_ _have_ been _a very good_ [um] experience for me . 
B|24| M: _yeah ._ 
A|25| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: [and] _it's_ kind _it's_ [it] _it _is_ a_ [it would be] kind [of] selfish [but] _it's _a_ good_ thing . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: _and um_ . 
A|29| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] [and i think] [you know] _we have_ such [a] need _now_ _you know i_ taught _you know _i_ _i_ think i_ _was_ paid [uh] _about_ nine thousand dollars _to_ teach for [the] year 
B|30| M: [uh] . 
A|31| A: [and i] worked _in_ _a very_ rural _school_ district [and _i] i_ _one_ _of the_ things [i] taught _was a_ computer class 
B|32| M: [uh] . 
A|33| A: [and] these kids _um you know_ every girl [i] taught except for _one_ _was_ pregnant . 
B|34| M: [uh] . 
A|35| A: _many_ _of the_ boys _in the_ room had _children and_ _they_ were _they_ were high _school_ juniors . 
B|36| M: [uh] . 
A|37| A: [and _i] just_ _there_ [you know] _they_ came _from_ poverty _they_ were _going to_ condition _in_ poverty [and] [it] _was_ [it] _was_ _the school_ district couldn't hire _many_ _people_ [it] _was_ _very_ difficult for _them_ _to_ hire [and i think] [you know] _in the_ sense [that] aspect [of] public service for education _in_ some _of the_ inner cities for [um] _just_ social workers _in_ some _of the_ inner cities [and] some _of the_ rural areas _where_ _they_ _just_ need advice _on_ medical [um] things [i think] [it's a] [really] [good] idea . [and] even _if_ [it is] overseas . 
B|38| M: _well_ [i'm] not sure [if] [it's] [the] teachers themselves [that] _are the_ problem [but] [i think] [the school] districts . 
A|39| A: _see_ [i] never _i i_ tell [you] sometimes [i] worry _about_ things over seas [because] _we have_ such problems _right_ here _in_ our own country . 
B|40| M: _well_ you're [right] we're [a] _long_ way away [from] [that] . 
A|41| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|42| M: [i i] _don't_ [know [i] guess] [uh] [i just] _don't_ [see] _the the_ _uh _the_ i_ mean [i'm] not sure [i] [see] [a] _great_ deal [of] [uh] [uh] improvement [from] [from] [the] way [we have] [it] [now] . 
A|43| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|44| M: [i] mean [it's] [it is] [you] [you] either want [to] serve [the] community [or] [you] want [to [be] [the] world] leader which [is] [the] same thing . 
A|45| A: _right ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: _uh you_ _don't_ [see] _too_ [many] [uh] _young_ _young_ men running [around] [with] guns [and] shooting [people] [or] anything [like] [that] . 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|48| M: _and uh_ 
A|49| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|50| M: [i think [that] _is] a_ big part [of it] _too_ . 
A|51| A: [yeah .] [i think] [it would] also _help them_ [if] _they_ then _went_ _on_ [to] college . _i know_ [that] my first couple [of] years [of] college were [um] [uh] probably [too] carefree _at_ [the] beginning 
B|52| M: [uh] . 
A|53| A: [and] then _at_ [the] end [i] had [to be] [too] serious . 
B|54| M: [uh] [i know] . 
A|55| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|56| M: [they] [have] [to be] [there] [at] [all] times . 
A|57| A: [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|58| M: [but] [i think that] [that's] part [of the] problem . 
A|59| A: [uh-huh] _that's right ._ 
B|60| M: [uh] 
A|61| A: [i] [yeah] _i think [i_ think] this _was_ this _was _a_ very_ interesting topic [uh] _because it's_ something _that you know_ [we] [don't] _talk about_ _in_ this country probably enough . 
B|62| M: [uh] _well_ [i i] [have] _a lot of_ friends [that] [have] [uh] [children] [that] [have] [children [and] [i] you] [you] can't blame [your] parents . 
A|63| A: _uh you know_ 
B|64| M: [yeah] _well_ [i guess] [that's] [that [was] _a] good_ [one] [to] put [on] [the] list . 
A|65| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|66| M: _and um_ . 
A|67| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [but] [it's] [it's _a] lot_ more expensive [and _i think] that's_ part [of it] [too] [is that] [um _you know] the the_ quality [of the] food [is] [really] not _as_ important [because it's] not [you] can't [just] _make_ [a] meal [now] [and] expect [to] [you] you're [going to] [have] [a very good] meal . 
A|69| A: [oh] [i think] [it is] . 
B|70| M: [so] . 
A|71| A: [i] [really] _think [i_ think] [um] [people] [you] should [i [you] know the] kids today [i] teach [i] spend [a lot of] my time teaching college students 
B|72| M: uh-uh . uh-hum . 
A|73| A: [and um] [i] find [great] disgust _in_ _them_ _in_ their _in_ their [um] their self-centeredness [and] their inability [to] understand [um] multicultural [or] multiracial [situation] 
B|74| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|75| A: [and i] [really] [you know] [they] [don't] understand [uh] how other [people] live [um] [they] [don't] understand 
B|76| M: [uh] . 
A|77| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [i think that's] [uh] [just] having [a good] time . 
B|78| M: [yeah .] 
A|79| A: [i] [uh] [a] friend [of] mine [is a] psychologist [and] he always refers [to] [it] [as] short-term pleasure oriented . [i guess] he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] [it] [you know] 
B|80| M: [uh] . 
A|81| A: today's [young] [people] [are] short-term pleasure oriented 
B|82| M: [right .] 
A|83| A: [and] everything _has [to_ [be] an] immediate reward [and] [it] _has [to_ be] fun . 
B|84| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|85| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|86| M: _well_ [it's] [nice] talking [to] [you .] 
A|87| A: [well] [they] say _i think i_ [um] [have] read recently [that] [uh the] bush administration _has_ increased [the] funding for [the] peace corps . 
B|88| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|89| A: [uh-huh .] [because] [i guess] [because] [of the] changes _in_ eastern europe [uh] they've increased funding for [the] peace corps . some [of [the] [i] guess] [it's] some [of the] peace dividend _in the_ sense [you] known 
B|90| M: [uh] . 
A|91| A: when [they're] decreasing some [of the] military spending some [of] [that] money _has_ gone into [the] peace corps 
B|92| M: [uh] . 
A|93| A: [and] some [of the] [are the] overseas programs . [uh] 
B|94| M: [i] [see] . 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [so i] [went] [and i did] what [i] could [to] [help them] [along] [the] way 
A|97| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|98| M: [but] [i think that's] [really] [a] [a] big part [of it] . 
A|99| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|100| M: [so] [uh] [i i] [don't] [know [i] think i] mean [i] [do] [like] _the the_ [uh [the] school] systems [in the] city _and uh_ 
A|101| A: [yeah] [that's] [very] true . [you know] how [many] [is] [it] [they] say [we have] [so] [many] _lawyers_ [in] this country [and [i] guess] [i i] live near washington being [in] [in] baltimore [it's] something [like] [one] [in] four [people] [in the] washington area [are] _lawyers_ 
B|102| M: [uh] 
A|103| A: [and] [and [i] just] sort [of] [think that's] ridiculous . 
B|104| M: [that's right .] 
A|105| A: [yeah] [with] [with] [the] [great] needs [that] [we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and _uh] [you know_ the the] problems [we have] [with] aids [and] cancer [and] [and] how come everybody [is a] lawyer [you know] [you know] 
B|106| M: [uh] [i'm] [i] am [i] [agree with you .] 
A|107| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|108| M: [you know [i] think i] [don't] [know] there's [too] [many] cases [where] [uh you know] [it's] not [the] person's fault [that] [has to] pay [the] full price . 
A|109| A: [uh-huh .] _yeah you_ saw statistics [that] _lawyers_ [and] _doctors_ [make] [the] most money [in the] [long] run . 
B|110| M: [right .] 
A|111| A: [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|112| M: [i] mean [it's] [just] [that [you know] the the] [lawyers] [are the] ones [that] [are] making [the] decisions [and] [the] [doctors] 
A|113| A: [that's] interesting . [uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: [so] [uh] [i guess] we're supposed [to] [talk about] family reunions . 
A|115| A: okay . hey thanks [so] much for [the] conversation . 
B|116| M: [yeah you] [too] . 
A|117| A: [well] thank [you] [very] much . _bye-bye_ .
