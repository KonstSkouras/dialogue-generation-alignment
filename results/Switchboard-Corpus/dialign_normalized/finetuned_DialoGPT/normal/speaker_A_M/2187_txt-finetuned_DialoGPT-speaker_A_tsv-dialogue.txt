B|2| M:  !!! ; !! remind _me_ [of] _that ._ 
A|3| A: _yeah_ _the_ cheese fondue _i_ _make_ _some_ people like swiss [um] _i_ prefer cheddar . _and_ _i'll_ mix _i_ won't _make_ _i_ won't _have a_ sharp cheddar _because_ _it_ for fondue _i think_ _it_ should be _a_ _little_ calmer than real sharp cheddar . 
B|4| M: uh-huh . 
A|5| A: _and_ then _i_ _was_ going _to make_ other things like potato skins . 
B|6| M: _oh_ _those_ _are_ _good_ _too_ .

B|8| M: uh-huh . 
A|9| A: _oh yeah_ _it's_ amazing how vegetables trays will _go_ at _a_ party .

B|12| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind _me_ [of] _that_ _now_ . 
A|13| A: my _uh_ girlfriends _do_ catering _and_ _they_ always about every party _they_ _do_ [is] _they_ _have a_ vegetable tray _. _i_ think_ _they_ try _and_ suggest _it ._ 
B|14| M: uh-huh . 
A|15| A: what _i've_ been doing _when_ _i_ get invited someplace _and_ bring something _i_ _make_ _uh_ food kabobs . _you_ take _little_ toothpicks _and_ cut up _uh_ pineapple _and_ strawberry _and_ even banana if _you_ can _do_ [it] _just_ _before_ _you_ leave . 
B|16| M: [um] . 
A|17| A: [it] stays nice _and_ fresh . 
B|18| M: yes . 
A|19| A: _yeah ._ [yeah] _i_ like [those] 
B|20| M: _yeah that_ sounds _good ._ 
A|21| A: [um] _they_ _they_ made _a_ couple [of] [those] _uh_ _they_ made one for my _uh_ bridal shower _and_ _i_ _was_ pretty pleased _. i_ _never_ made one for myself though . _but_ _they_ look easy enough _to make_ _it's not_ 
B|22| M: uh-huh . 
A|23| A: _yeah ._ 
B|24| M: [it's] [just] _so_ _much_ _work_ . 
A|25| A: [yeah] _you_ probably get _this_ probably pretty sticky after _you_ get done . 
B|26| M: [yeah] 
A|27| A: then you've got _to_ drain _the_ water _out_ [of] _the_ watermelon _because_ _you_ _know_ _when_ _you_ scrape [it] [it] makes _the_ water . 
B|28| M: [yeah [.] i] [know] [uh] _we_ _used [to_ _do] that_ _with_ _our_ [uh] _our_ kids we'd _we_ _would_ _we_ did _that_ [to] _our_ trees [when] [they] _were_ [little] [and] we'd [go] through _the _the_ uh_ [the] mulch 
A|29| A: [yeah] [um] something [i] [do] _is a_ fruit [is] _i'll_ get [um] _make_ chocolate sauce [and] dip strawberries [and] bananas in _them ._ [yeah] _i have_ two nieces [and] [they] [they] [they] [go] melt _some_ chocolate chips [go] buy [me] _some_ strawberries . 
B|30| M:  !!! remind [me] [of] _that_ _now_ . 
A|31| A: [yeah] _you_ [know] if _you_ get _a_ sweet strawberry _they're_ [much] better _but_ if _you_ get _a_ sour strawberry 
B|32| M: [yeah .] 
A|33| A: huh . [yeah] no [they] [um] [the] strawberries [are] coming in season [now] from _they're_ _they're_ coming up from florida [of] course [. i] live in vermont [so] . _but they're_ [really] reasonably priced _they're_ coming up from florida [so] . 
B|34| M: [oh] . 
A|35| A: [yeah .] 
B|36| M: [but they're] [out] [now] 
A|37| A: [yeah] _i think_ [the uh] actually _i think_ [they] get [um] _some_ _of them_ from south america . 
B|38| M: uh-huh . 
A|39| A: yep [they] _a_ lot [of] [um] [of] _a_ [um] winter produce comes from south america . 
B|40| M: uh-huh . 
A|41| A: [of] course their seasons [are] switched . 
B|42| M: uh-huh . 
A|43| A: [so] [um] [do] _you_ want [to] discuss [the] recipe ? 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! auto !! ety !! _this [is_ a] dog [and] cat cross 
A|45| A: _i have a_ recipe if _you_ want 
B|46| M: _yeah that_ sounds _good ._ 
A|47| A: [um] [it] filled [a] lot [of] people try [to] stay away from [this] _but i_ _make_ my own homemade pudding [just] _because _i_ don't_ like box pudding . 
B|48| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|49| A: [yeah it] [and] [it] if _you_ [um] _well_ first [of] _all_ [i] take about [a] quarter [and] [a] half [of] milk [and] [i] put [it] in [a] two quart saucepan [and] _you_ put [it] on _a really_ low heat . 
B|50| M: uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [and] _you_ want [to] use one [of] your [good] sauce pans [that] dissipate [the] heat _because_ [it] [it] ends up burning [i] mean no matter how careful _you_ [are] _you_ still might get [a] film on [the] bottom [of] [the] pot . 
B|52| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|53| A: _i don't_ let [that] worry [me] . [and] [i] get [the] milk lukewarm [and] then [i] pour about [a] half [a] cup [of] cornstarch in [it] [and] _i have_ [this] thing [it's] called [the] slender blender [it] [it] makes [the uh] [it] makes [uh] [a] whip topping [out] [of] milk if _you_ get [the] milk cold enough . [it's] _uh _i_ don't know_ [they're] called moo goo leaves or something [they're] 
B|54| M: [oh] [i've] heard [of [them] .] 
A|55| A: [yeah .] [they're] real _neat ._ 
B|56| M: [oh] _that's_ [neat .] [i've] [never] heard [of] [that] [before] . 
A|57| A: _i think_ [they're] real reasonably priced _some_ [of them] [they] [used to] be [a] hundred dollars [and] [they] [used to] whip skim milk into [a] dessert _but i_ didn't get [that] one [i] got [the] _black_ [and] decker kind . [but] [uh] [it's] real handy _because_ [it] doesn't _have a_ cord [and] _you_ beat [this] cornstarch right into [the the] milk _you_ [know] [and] [it] does an excellent job or [just] hand beat _it [._ i] guess _you could_ use [a] hand mixer _but _i_ don't_ _think_ [it] _i don't_ _think_ [it] gets [it] [good] enough . 
B|58| M: [yeah] [i've] _had_ [some] [i have [a] a] [black] iron skillet [that] [i] [i] bought [it] [because i] _wanted [to_ make] [a] barbecue [but i] thought _you just_ can't _make [it_ .] 
A|59| A: [and] then [before] [the] milk gets [too] hot [um] [i] add two beaten eggs [and] [i] [really] mix [them] in [good .] [and] then about [a] half [a] cup [of] sugar [and] [i] let [it] pretty [much] [i] beat [it] like every minute for about ten seconds [and] [it's] [it] starts thickening [when] [it] thickens [the] cornstarch might get [a] [little] _i don't know_ [it] gets like [little] globs [of] [this] rubbery cornstarch [and] [you just] keep beating [it] in . [and] [it's] [the the] trick [is] [is] [to] [have] [this] blender [so] if [you] [were] you'd [have] [to] probably almost [go] [out] [and] someone who's [just] going [to [make] it] first time [it's] you'll [have] [much] better luck if [you] [had] one [of] these [little] blenders . [and] then [you] can add cocoa powder [to] [it] [to make] chocolate or after [it's] thickened [i] cook [it] for [a] [good] once [it] starts boiling [i] [just] [i] cook [it] for [a] [good] seven minutes seven [to] ten minutes 
B|60| M: [oh] _that's_ [good .] 
A|61| A: [and] then [you] can [make] chocolate or [you] can take [it] off [and] let [it] cool [you] put [um] _really good_ vanilla favoring in [it] [and] [some] butter [and] [that] makes french vanilla [um] custard . [yeah] 
B|62| M: [oh] [that] sounds [good .] 
A|63| A: [a] chocolate powder . 
B|64| M: yes . 
A|65| A: [yeah that] cocoa [yeah] [the] unsweetened . [it] comes in like [a] real dark can 
B|66| M: [um] . 
A|67| A: [our] mothers [used to] use [it .] [and] then 
B|68| M: [oh] _that's_ _great_ . 
A|69| A: [yeah] _we all [used_ to] 
B|70| M: [we all used] 
A|71| A: [yeah] [it's] [the] unsweetened kind _it's not_ like nestles quik . 
B|72| M: [yeah .] 
A|73| A: [i] suppose _you could_ use [that .] 
B|74| M: [yeah .] 
A|75| A: [yeah] [but] [um] 
B|76| M: [i don't know] . 
A|77| A: _well_ [i] [used [to] make] [the] regular pudding [the] chocolate [and] put [it] in [the] pie shell [and] if [it] [would] sit in [the] refrigerator for [a] day where [you] cut [the] pie [it] [would] soak into [the] pie shell [and] [it] _was_ like red [and] i'm like [oh] [this is] kind [of] groedy . 
B|78| M: [i] [know] . 
A|79| A: [um] actually [i] found [it] in one [of] my mother's [um] homemade cookbooks [i] mean something she [had] collected [out] [of] woman's day or something . 
B|80| M:  !!! % !! _that's_ funny . 
A|81| A: [so] 
B|82| M: [yeah] _that's_ [that] [was] [a [really] good] book . 
A|83| A: _i think_ [you] couldn't [make it] [with] [a] hand whisk or or [a] regular beater [but] [um] 
B|84| M: [well] [i've] [never] tried [it] [but _i] would_ imagine [you could] . 
A|85| A: [yeah] [but i] still _think_ [a] beater [would] [do] [it] [good] enough [um] [the] trick [is] [to] get [the] cornstarch 
B|86| M: uh-huh . 
A|87| A: [um] [yeah] right in [the] in [the] lukewarm milk . sometimes [i] put [the] cornstarch in [a] separate bowl [and] [i would] put [it] in [the] sink [and] _i'll_ take my lukewarm milk [and] put [it] in [the] cornstarch [and] beat [it] [good .] [it] seems [to] be better than putting [the the] cornstarch into [the] liquid [it] once [it] hits [the] top [of] [the] liquid [it] seems [to make] [little] balls [and] stuff on [the] top . 
B|88| M: [uh [i] think] _that's_ true . 
A|89| A: [yeah .] [and] _i'll_ [do] [this] [uh] sometimes _i'll_ put my after [i] pour [that] into my back into my saucepan . _i'll_ put [the] eggs in [the] same dish [and] beat [them] up [and] then pour [the] cornstarch [and] [the] milk mixture in [the] egg . [so] 
B|90| M:  !!! [it's not] [it's not] very _thick_ [but] _it's a_ very _thick_ piece [of] cornstark . 
A|91| A: yep . [and] then [you] [know] if [you] can put your cocoa in [with] your cornstarch if [you] [wanted to] . [the] cocoa even seems [to] thicken [it] even more . 
B|92| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|93| A: [because] by [the] vanilla doesn't seem [to] thicken as [well] as [the] sometimes [the] cocoa [is] like my husband [really] likes [it] [thick] he says [i] can stick [the] spoon right in [this] . 
B|94| M: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [because] i'm always worrying [it] won't firm up [because] [it] [when] [you] take [it] [out] [of] [the] saucepan [it's] like boy [i] hope [this] thickens [a] [little] more [because] [it's not] like real package [thick] [you] [know] [when] [you] cook [a] package [it's] [it's a] [little] less 
B|96| M: [yeah .] 
A|97| A: [but i] put [it] in [a] nice glass bowl [and] [um] [some] people [don't] like [that] [that] film on [the] pudding [so] [you] can put [uh] saran wrap over [the] top . 
B|98| M: [uh] [i'll] bet [you] _that's_ [uh] 
A|99| A: [and] then once [the] pudding starts cooling [it] makes [little] balls [of] water on [the] saran wrap [so] [when] [you] pull [the] saran wrap back [you] sort [of] should be [a] [little] careful pull [it] back [and] shake [the] water off [the] saran wrap [and] [i] might put [it] back on . [but] [um] 
B|100| M: [now] _that's_ interesting . 
A|101| A: [yeah] after [well] [when] [it] starts steaming [a] lot [uh i] definitely [yeah] put [it] in [the] refrigerator 
B|102| M: [uh] [i'll] bet [you] _do that_ [yeah .] 
A|103| A: [but] [um] [i] my father always told [me] if [you] put hot food in your refrigerator you're going [to [make] it] [work] [too] hard . 
B|104| M: [oh [yeah] .] 
A|105| A: [that's] [yeah] 
B|106| M: [and] [uh] . 
A|107| A: [so] [that's] why [i] [do [that] .] 
B|108| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|109| A: [so] [well] [i don't know] [that's] my my [great] hard recipe .
