B|16| M: oh , _yeah ._ 
A|17| A: eighty percent of _the public_ , according _to_ bill moyers' _, uh ,_ recent _, uh ,_ piece for _, uh ,_ _public_ broadcasting , which , _by the_ way _is a_ very good use of government money _. i think_ p b s _is_ wonderful . but this special focused on [the] fact [that] eighty percent of [the] people in this country are , are seeing _their_ real incomes , [and] thus , standards of living , decline .

B|28| M: _yeah ._ 
A|29| A: [i think] [that's] coming [and i think] once , once people really start [to] communicate how they feel , things are going [to] change . until then [, [i] think] _, you_ [know] [, it's] going [to] be really painful . so [the] question [is] , how soon are we going [to] start [to] get our money's worth _and ,_ as _you_ said [, it's] how soon we get involved , [and i think] we need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to] get involved , like allowing us [to] _call_ [a] toll free _number_ [and] say , hey , look , _do_ [it] this way , [not] [that] way , or [i] like this , or [i] _don't_ like [that ,] or this [is] how [i] feel _about_ your spending my money on art [that] [i] _don't_ [think] [is] art . 
B|30| M: [well , _i] [,_ i] agree [with] [you] [. i think] [the] [thing] [is [that] [,] uh ,] [when] [you] [call] [the] [eight hundred] dollar [number] [, you] [don't] [have to [,] uh] 
A|31| A: [well [,] that's] [the] good [thing] _about_ _what_ [is] happening because [i think] more [and] more [the] news media , which takes [a] heck of [a] beating _and ,_ [and] deserves some of [it ,] [is] telling us [, you] [know] , _about the_ problems . so [the] more we communicate , hey , look , we want [a] change here , because [, you] [know] , as [it] turns out , we've wasted [a] tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country .
