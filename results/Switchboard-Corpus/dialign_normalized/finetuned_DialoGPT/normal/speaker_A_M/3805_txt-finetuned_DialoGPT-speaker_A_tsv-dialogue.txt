B|0| M: uh-huh . 
A|1| A: _well_ there are _a_ lot of things _that_ people _i think_ general 
B|2| M: uh-huh . 
A|3| A: _well _i_ think_ _it's_ interesting _to_ look at _uh_ where _the_ money goes _and_ _it_ goes _a_ lot of places where _it_ probably ought _not_ go _and_ _and i_ _don't_ _think_ generally _i think_ what's interesting _is that_ we probably represent _the_ majority of people in this country in terms of _their_ feelings _about the_ government 
B|4| M: uh-huh . 
A|5| A: _and_ how _it_ serves us given _the_ extraordinarily large sum of money _the_ government has _to_ operate _with_ . 
B|6| M: uh-huh . 
A|7| A: _and_ _that_ _what_ _i think_ _is_ going _to_ be really interesting _is_ _what_ we _do_ _about_ _it_ _. i_ mean we are going _to_ _have to_ change _the_ people who represent us . 
B|8| M: _right ._ 
A|9| A: _i_ mean _and i think_ _it's_ going _to_ be real interesting _to_ see _and_ _and_ then force upon them _uh_ 
B|10| M: _yeah ._ 
A|11| A: [yeah] [right] _that's_ _i think_ _that's_ _the_ only _thing_ _that's_ going _to_ change _it_ . 
B|12| M: [and i think] [the] [uh] 
A|13| A: our anger _is_ going _to_ _have to_ _to_ give rise _to_ _to_ more activity on our part . 
B|14| M: [i think] [that] [uh] . 
A|15| A: [uh] i've i've said for years [that] there's full employment for [the] politically active [and] in our society [uh] there's very little full employment . most people in this country are getting worse off _not_ better off . 
B|16| M: oh _yeah ._ 
A|17| A: eighty percent of _the public_ according _to_ bill moyers' [uh] recent [uh] piece for [uh] _public_ broadcasting which _by the_ way _is a_ very good use of government money _. i think_ p b s _is_ wonderful . but this special focused on [the] fact [that] eighty percent of [the] people in this country are are seeing _their_ real incomes [and] thus standards of living decline . [and] twenty percent are seeing theirs improve . _that's_ _not_ _a formula_ for _a_ better society . 
B|18| M: no no . [it's] [not] . [it] [it's] _it [is_ [a] formula] [that's] [that's] being _used_ [by] politicians _and by_ industry _and [by_ [the] public] [to] [their] advantage . 
A|19| A: [and] [the] government really plays [a] role in this . 
B|20| M: uh-huh . 
A|21| A: [i] mean _well_ they are [the] people whose strings are pulled [and by] [i] guess powerful 
B|22| M: _yeah ._ 
A|23| A: _you_ _know_ [and] [it's] really interesting [to] see how [that] affects people because essentially more [and] more people in this country are [not] likely [to] revolt in [the] way [that] people [used] [to] [think] of of [the] voter revolting . but people are pretty much getting [the] picture [that] some people get taken care of [and] others _don't_ [and] they [think] [it's] unfair [and] _when_ they recognize [that] [it's] [their] tax money they're going [to] _do_ more _about_ [it] _. i_ i'll tell _you_ one quick [uh] one _thing_ very interesting . c b s after [the] state of [the] union address [is] going [to] open up [a] telephone line an _eight hundred_ _number_ [and] people can _call_ in [and] say _what_ they _think about_ what's going on in this country . 
B|24| M: oh [i] [know] . 
A|25| A: they expect opening [it] for one hour [that] they'll get three _hundred_ thousand telephone calls . 
B|26| M: oh goodness . 
A|27| A: [and] i've thought for years [it] would make [a] lot of sense [to] create an _eight hundred_ _number_ for voters [to] _call_ [and] [and] vent [their] frustration _with_ government . like one _eight hundred_ capitol or something like [that] . _you_ [know] just [a] _number you_ could _call_ from anywhere anytime . 
B|28| M: _yeah ._ 
A|29| A: [i think] [that's] coming [and i think] once once people really start [to] communicate how they feel things are going [to] change . until then [i think] _you_ [know] [it's] going [to] be really painful . so [the] question [is] how soon are we going [to] start [to] get our money's worth [and] as _you_ said [it's] how soon we get involved [and i think] we need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to] get involved like allowing us [to] _call_ [a] toll free _number_ [and] say hey look _do_ [it] this way [not] [that] way or [i] like this or [i] _don't_ like [that] or this [is] how [i] feel _about_ your spending my money on art [that] [i] _don't_ [think] [is] art . 
B|30| M: [well i] [i] agree [with] [you] [. i think] [the] [thing] [is that] [uh] [when] [you] [call] [the] [eight hundred] dollar [number you] [don't] [have to] [uh] 
A|31| A: [well] [that's] [the] good [thing] _about_ _what_ [is] happening because [i think] more [and] more [the] news media which takes [a] heck of [a] beating [and] [and] deserves some of [it is] telling us [you] [know] _about the_ problems . so [the] more we communicate hey look we want [a] change here because [you] [know] as [it] turns out we've wasted [a] tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country . 
B|32| M: _right ._ 
A|33| A: over [a] very long period of time . 
B|34| M: _yeah ._ 
A|35| A: [uh] _and uh_

A|37| A: [right .] 
B|38| M: [and uh] . 
A|39| A: [yeah .] [well] [you] may be [right .] [what] [i think] [is] really going [to] be interesting [is] [to] see how [uh] we as [a] society deal [with] [it] [and i] [and i think] [it is] [what] [you] say [it's] [it's] [a]
