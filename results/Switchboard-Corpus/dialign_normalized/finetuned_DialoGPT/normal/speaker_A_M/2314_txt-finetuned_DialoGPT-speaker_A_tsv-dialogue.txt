B|28| M: _right_ [uh-huh .] 
A|29| A: [and] their manager assumes [they] _have a_ drug _problem_ [i mean] if someone assumed [that] [of] [me] [i] would be upset .

A|31| A: [it's] _an_ accusation [and] [and] [it's] [and] [it's] based _on_ _on_ [a] perception [that] someone has _as_ [how] [a] drug user would behave when some drug users behave [uh] normal [uh] [you [know] .] 
B|32| M: [uh-huh .] uh-hue . 
A|33| A: [right] _exactly [._ [i] [i] don't] [the] [i think] almost [the] only _way_ [that] drug _testing_ _can_ be _done_ fairly _is_ if [it's] across [the] board _from_ _from_ [the] janitors [to] [the] executive management .

A|39| A: _well_ does _your_ does _your_ _job_ require [you] [to] drive company equipment or [to] operate [any] type [of] machinery [that] might endanger someone ? 
B|40| M: [uh well] [it's] [it] _it depends [on_ _the] job_ [. [i] mean] [uh] _i mean [i_ i] [can] _work_ [in the] automotive air bag industry [and] i've [i] worked [in the] transportation industry [for] nineteen years . 
A|41| A: [well] [that] doesn't [i mean i] ... 
B|42| M: [i [i] _think] they_ should [have] more control over [what] [they] [do .] 
A|43| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|44| M: [but] [you] can't [do] [that] . 
A|45| A: _that is_ odd [. i] was drug tested [uh] [not] [for [the] job] [i] [have] now [but] [for the] prior [job] [uh] [but] _i know_ [that] [they] sent [that] [the job] [i] had [before] [that] [well] [the job] [i] [have] [have] now requested my [uh uh] my [uh] medical record _from_ my old company 
B|46| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|47| A: [so [i] don't know] if [i] wasn't drug tested based [on] [that] or [because the] man who hired [me] didn't request [the] drug [test] [because] _i know_ [that] my company does drug [testing] [on] occasion . 
B|48| M: uh-uh . oh [that's] [that is] 
A|49| A: [well] no [i don't] [think they] [can] [they] [can] force another company [to] [not] drug [test] [me] [just] by saying [that] [i i] didn't [i mean] 
B|50| M: uh-hope . 
A|51| A: [they] [don't know] [that] [i don't] use drugs . [they] [just] tested [me] once . 
B|52| M: [yeah] [i] 
A|53| A: [but] [i] used [to] [work for] [a] power company [so] [it] was very important [that] [they] make _sure_ their employees especially linemen [uh] were [clean] . 
B|54| M: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|55| A: [and] since [i] was [just] [you know] one [of] [the] office folk [i guess] [it] wasn't _as_ important [to] them [that] [they] [test] [me] regularly . [but] _i know_ [they] [test] most [of] [the] service people fairly regularly [uh] [just] across [the] board . 
B|56| M: [yeah .] 
A|57| A: no they're _all_ [of] them are tested once every three 
B|58| M: oh _okay ._ 
A|59| A: [it's a] rotation .

A|61| A: [but] [it] [but] again [it depends on] [what] [job] you're [in] . 
B|62| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [the] men [that] are out there fixing power lines are tested [a] lot [and the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with] [with the] guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't tested _as_ much . 
B|64| M: [right] . 
A|65| A: [but] [but] [see] [they] make [that] clear [to] them _as_ [they hire] those guys [what] [what] [the] drug [testing] schedule [is] . 
B|66| M: [right] . 
A|67| A: [they] say [we] we're [testing] [you] tomorrow [and] we'll [test] [you] every three months thereafter while [you] [work] here . 
B|68| M: [yeah .] 
A|69| A: [yeah] [it's] [it's] made very clear upon hiring .
