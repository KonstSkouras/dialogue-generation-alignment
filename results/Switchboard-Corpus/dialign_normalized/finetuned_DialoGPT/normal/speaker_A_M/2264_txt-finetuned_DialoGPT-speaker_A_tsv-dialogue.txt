B|0| M: _oh _no_ ._ 
A|1| A: _so_ if _they_ would come up curbside _recycling_ 
B|2| M: _yeah_ _that's_ true . 
A|3| A: _well_ now _have_ _they _moved_ them_ behind wal-mart ? 
B|4| M: _yeah_ [they] [they] [have] they've [moved them] _i_ _think_ [they moved] _the_ _other_ _one_ _um_ _to a_ _different_ _place_ _and uh_ _they're_ trying _to_ _to_ put some [recycling] _there_ _and_ _it's_ _just_ _uh_ . 
A|5| A: [oh] god . 
B|6| M: _they're_ _they're_ _really_ trying _to_ trying _to_ start _that_ trend . 
A|7| A: [oh] . _that's really_ nice [to] _know_ _because_ _we_ _were_ doing [the] same thing . _because_ [to] take _it_ [to a] metco _you_ [have] [to] take _it_ when [they're] open _you_ _know_ which _is_ always _a real_ pain . 
B|8| M: _yeah_ we've _i've_ _had_ [to] stop _and_ _think_ _about_ _that because_ _um_ _i_ don't [know] _it's_ _just_ _i just_ [it] [it] seems ridiculous . 
A|9| A: [and] _so_ when [that] thing came up in wal-mart parking lot _we_ thought [oh] this _is_ _great_ . [and] _we_ started taking [them] up _there ._ [and] then _all_ [the] sudden [it] disappeared _you_ [know] [i] didn't _know ._ [and] we're going [oh no] [there] goes our [recycling] [place] . 
B|10| M: _yeah ._ 
A|11| A: _that's really_ nice [to] find out [that] [it's] behind [there] _well_ _we_ pretty much _do_ [um] plastic milk cartons [and] [um] [um] [um] newspapers . [i] couldn't even [think] _of_ what _you_ call [them] . 
B|12| M: _oh really_ ? 
A|13| A: plastic milk cartons newspapers [and] cans [and] glass _i guess_ _is_ [the] four _is really_ [the] four things [that] _we_ _do ._ 
B|14| M: uh-huh . 
A|15| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|16| M: [i guess] we've _got_ [to] wait _a little_ bit . 
A|17| A: [and] [really] [that's] [about] _that's really_ [about] [it] . _is_ [there] anything any [place] else [that] [really] takes anything [other] than _that that_ _you_ [know] _of_ ? 
B|18| M: _uh_ [we] _uh_ _we have_ _uh_ . 
A|19| A: [oh really] . 
B|20| M: uh-huh . 
A|21| A: [i] _know ._ 
B|22| M: _so ._ 
A|23| A: [i] _know ._ [i] _know ._ we're kind _of_ [the] same way . _you_ [know] at first _you_ [know] _you_ at first _it was_ _a real_ _it was_ _a real_ hassle [and] i'm wondering are [we] [really] going [to] _do_ this but _you_ kind _of_ get [i guess] into [a little] routine _you_ [know] where [it] becomes _is_ automatic now [to] throw [different] things in [different] places 
B|24| M: uh-huh . 
A|25| A: _you_ _know ._ [so] [i just] go _you_ [know] [we have] [a] pretty _good_ size pantry in our kitchen [and] [i've] [just] [got] three trash cans sitting in [there] _you_ [know] [we] [just] kind _of_ dump things in each [one] if _you_ [know] if [we] get [them] 
B|26| M: uh-huh . 
A|27| A: [so .] 
B|28| M: _well i_ [think] [that's really] important . 
A|29| A: [oh] [they] _do_ _too ._ [and] [they're] impossible [to] crush . _i mean_ _you_ can't get [the] _down_ [to] any size _you_ _know ._ if _you_ get four milk cartons [and] [that] fills up trash bag _you_ [know] pretty easily [so .] _you_ [know] 
B|30| M: _well i_ don't [know .] 
A|31| A: [oh really] . 
B|32| M: [yeah] [and] [i] [and] [and] [it's] [it's] been [a real] problem _for_ me . 
A|33| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|34| M: _and uh_ [they] [were] [real] convenient _and uh_ . 
A|35| A: [oh] [that] will be _good_ . 
B|36| M: [so .] 
A|37| A: sure . let somebody get something out _of_ [it] . 
B|38| M: [yeah] [yeah] [it's] [a real] [good] idea . 
A|39| A: [yeah] 
B|40| M: [i mean] [that's] [just] [that that] [just] isn't right . 
A|41| A: ha-ha [well i] _was_ kind _of_ hoping with _you_ [know] _do_ _you_ work [for] t [i] ? 
B|42| M: [yeah] _i [do_ .] 
A|43| A: [no .] [yeah .] [there] _was_ [a] t [i] has [got] this organization called t [a] d which _is_ t i'ers against drugs . [and] _you_ [know] we're [recycling] aluminum cans up here [and uh] [just] what _you_ would buy out _of_ [the] machines [and] drink here [and] [there] _was_ crushers out in _all_ _of_ [the] hallways _you_ [know] [and] [that's] [they] use [the] money from [that] [to] fund this t i'ers against drugs program . [it's] _you_ [know] t [i] doesn't give [them] any money _all_ everything _is_ made from [that] . [and] [they] [had] talked [about] having [a] thing like [one] saturday [a] month _you_ could come [and] drop your aluminum cans off from home _you_ [know] 
B|44| M: [yeah .] 
A|45| A: [and] i'm kind _of_ like [yeah .] [i] shall [they] would [do] [that because] at least somebody _was_ getting [the] money out _of_ [it] _you_ [know .] [that] _was_ going [to] use [it] [for] [good] [so] 
B|46| M: [well i] [think] [that's] [a] [great] idea . 
A|47| A: sounds like _you_ [have] [a little] [one] [just] like [i do] 
B|48| M: [yeah] [i [do] .] 
A|49| A: [yeah .] mine _was_ two in december

A|53| A: [oh] [do] [they] [really] . curbside pick up ? 
B|54| M: [oh] [yeah] [and uh] [it's] [it] [it] [is really] weird . [they] [have] [uh] [a little] bit [of] [a] strangler [down] [there .] 
A|55| A: [i] [really] hope [they] [do] [that] in louisville . [it] would make [it] [a] lot easier on _all_ [of] us . talk [to you] later . 
B|56| M: [all] righty .
