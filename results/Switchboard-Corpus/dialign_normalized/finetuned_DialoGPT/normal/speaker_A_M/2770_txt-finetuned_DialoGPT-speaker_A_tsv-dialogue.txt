A|28| A: [yeah] _i think it's_ [really] important _to_ [that that] if _you_ get [a] _pet_ [that] [they're] either spayed or neutered [so] [that] _you_ _know_ we're not [just] _going_ on _with_ this _pet_ population [and] having _to_ [just] get rid [of] _them_ . 
B|29| M: _well_ [that] [uh] [that's] [a] big part [of it] . 
A|30| A: [that that] [kind of] gripes on [me] some but but _i don't know_ . 
B|31| M: [i think] [uh] . 
A|32| A: [more] [and] [more] people are [right] [right] . 
B|33| M: _and that's_ [a] [that's] [the] way [it's] [going to] [be] . 
A|34| A: but [uh] 
B|35| M: [i think it's] [a] wonderful [thing] _though_ . 
A|36| A: [i think] [that's] [really] true . 
B|37| M: [i] [i think] [that] [was] [one] [of] [the] things [that i] [i was] [really] interested in [when [i] was] younger [was] in [pet] raising .

A|40| A: [yeah] exactly . 
B|41| M: [so [i] don't know] [it's] [it] seems [like] there's _a lot_ [of] things [that] need [to] [be] done about [uh] recycling . 
A|42| A: exactly . [i think] our community is [a lot] [more] conscious now [though] too [and] [and that's] good too . 
B|43| M: uh-huh . 
A|44| A: [well] [i think] [that's] all [i] [have to] say .
