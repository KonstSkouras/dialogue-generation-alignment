A|20| A: money _from_ money _for_ taking _care of the_ infants takes money away _from_ taking _care of the_ elderly _or_ _do_ _they_ both _get_ served ? [uh] [that's [a] good] _point_ . 
B|21| M: [yeah .] 
A|22| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| M: [so] [i'm] [really] [concerned] [about] [that] .

B|25| M: _i'm not_ [i] don [i] [really] [don't know] _what_ [the] answer [is .] 
A|26| A: [well] [and] one _of the_ things i'd [and i'm] [with you] [that] [i] [don't know] [is] [is] [that] [really] [the] only way _it's_ being transmitted _or_ was [that] [the] easier way [to] _tell us_ [and] we're [going to] find out _more_ . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] 
A|28| A: [that's] [that's] [the] [part] [that] 
B|29| M: _i mean you_ [you] [have] [to] look at [it] [more] [from] [a] [a] selfish [point] [of] view [you don't] want [to] [you] want [to] _take_ [care of the] world [and you] want [you] can't _just_ come [in] [and] [do] [this] [you] need [to] make [this] world [a] better place [for] [all] [of] [us]

A|36| A: [and] how [is] [it] [really] transmitted _et_ cetera . 
B|37| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: which [is] [i think] [what] _they_ [also] [don't know] . _i mean that's_ [i think] _they_ _they_ told [us] [what] was convenient [and] felt safe [to] say [you know] . 
B|39| M: [right .] [well] [they] _can_ [tell us] _anything_ [they] want . 
A|40| A: [it] was _nice_ [to] _isolate_ [it] [to] one particular community [that] [they] [have] trouble [you know] [they] [just] as soon [not] approve [of] anyway [but] [but] [that] isn't how [it] was [in] africa .
