B|62| M:  !!! % [oh [,] _really] ?_ 
A|63| A: [so] most _of the [,_ it's] _almost_ twenty years old [, and] most [of the] houses around _here_ [were] built pretty _much_ [the] _same_ _style_ [uh ,] [we] [have a] friend [that] lives _two_ blocks over [, and] his _house_ [is] _almost_ identical [to] us , except his [is] three bedrooms [and] _ours_ [is] four 
B|64| M: [uh ,] uh-homing . 
A|65| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty _much_ [the] _same_ . _so _i_ , i think_ most [of] them _are_ [there] _was [, it_ ,] like most areas [that] _are_ built _, um ,_ [there] [were] probably , like _two_ [or] three styles [you] could choose from 
B|66| M: [uh] . 
A|67| A: [and [,] [and] , uh [,] that's] pretty _much_ _all_ [the] houses [in] [the area] , [for] probably [a] [square] mile , i'd say , at least , _maybe_ [even] [a] little bit _more_ than [that .]
