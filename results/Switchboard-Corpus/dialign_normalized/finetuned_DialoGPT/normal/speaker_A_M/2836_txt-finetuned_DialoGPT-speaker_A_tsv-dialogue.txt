A|7| A: _about_ fifteen miles [. i] live [in a] little suburb [uh] which [is] [i guess] _from_ dallas [is] twelve miles [or] [so] 
B|8| M: uh-uh . 
A|9| A: [but] [it's] pretty congested . [we] [are] considered _in _the_ country_ 
B|10| M: [uh] . 
A|11| A: [but] [it] doesn't really feel [like] _you're_ _in _the_ country_ . 
B|12| M: um _well_ _that's_ _that that_ [is] _a problem_ too uh-homing [uh] . 
A|13| A: _our_ major _crimes_ [in] _our_ immediate town [uh] [is] probably robberies _house_ robberies [and] very few instances [of] _you know_ alcohol _drugs_ [uh] reported . 
B|14| M:  !!! % 
A|15| A: however [i'm] [sure] _they're_ [there] . 
B|16| M: _yeah _i_ know_ _they_ [are] . 
A|17| A: [but uh] _right_ [now] _our_ _neighborhood_ [is] running _about_ [uh] eighty percent _of the_ homeowners [have] _been_ robbed sometime during [their] [their uh] existence [in] [that] _neighborhood ._ 
B|18| M: _oh_ goodness . 
A|19| A: [and] since [that] _time_ everybody's _got_ _some_ sort [of] burglar system _or _you_ know_ [uh] burglar alarms _uh and_ including [the] _out_ _uh the_ outer perimeter type [uh] devices sensors [and] things [like _that] ._ 
B|20| M: _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: [it's] cut _back_ _you know_ considerably [but] _it _it_ just_ shifts [it] _from_ _our_ _neighborhood_ [to] [another] _neighborhood_ [to] _other_ _neighborhood_ [so] [it] still [uh] remains city wide pretty pretty high . 
B|22| M: _yeah ._ 
A|23| A: _uh i_ _would_ _say_ [the] majority [of] [it's] happening during [the] day [uh] between probably ten _in the_ morning [and] _three_ _in the_ afternoon . 
B|24| M: _yeah ._ 
A|25| A: most 
B|26| M: _well_ _i'm not_ [sure] [. i] _don't_ [know] _what what_ percentage [of the] voters _actually_ turn [out] [to] vote [. _i] i_ _we're_ supposed _to be_ talking [about] _people who_ turn [out] _at_ lunch [time] [to] vote [in the] evening . 
A|27| A: [well] most families most families [are] young [and] both _people are_ working . 
B|28| M: _oh_ uh-hoh . 
A|29| A: [so] _they're_ happening during [the] hours _they're_ gone _from_ work . 
B|30| M: _right ._ 
A|31| A: [uh] [so] _uh i_ _would_ _say_ [that's] probably [their] prime motivation . they'll they'll stock [your] _house_ [and] [uh] look [at] [your] pattern [and] _then_ [go] _from_ [there] . 
B|32| M: _right ._ 
A|33| A: _uh they_ classify most [of] them as professionals . 
B|34| M: _yeah ._ 
A|35| A: _uh _you_ get_ [a] few [of] them _that are_ [a] little bit sloppier [uh] _just_ taking _uh you know_ _just_ junk items [that] [they] _they can_ _just_ _get_ _you know_ ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ real quick . 
B|36| M: _right ._ 
A|37| A: probably [the] biggest items _that uh_ _that _you_ get_ [in] _our_ _neighborhood_ [or] _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles [the] _you know_ mercedes volvos things [that] _they can_ _get_ _you know_ [big] dollars _for_ _and the_ jewelry [are] [the] major targets 
B|38| M: [uh] . 
A|39| A: guns [that] sort [of] stuff . 
B|40| M: _yeah that's_ true . 
A|41| A: very few _you know_ penny penny ante stuff . 
B|42| M: [uh i] _see ._ 
A|43| A: [well] _uh the_ police force _for_ [one] _i think_ [they] could [uh] definitely add _to the_ police force _and the_ type equipment [that] [they] use _. uh_ [it's] [oh] [right] [now] _i think_ [we] [are] [about] thirty thousand [people] [and] there's only eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty _for_ [that] amount _of people_ which [is] [not] very _many_ . 
B|44| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|45| A: [and] 
B|46| M: [and the] _problem_ _with that_ [is] [that [uh] you know] _when_ [you get] into _the the_ drug culture _the people are_ selling [it] [to the] highest bidder . 
A|47| A: [well] [the] course [in] _our_ particular state [uh] [we] _have the_ prison overcrowding whatever [so] _they're_ giving [the] early release [uh] 
B|48| M: [uh] 
A|49| A: [yeah] _and and_ [it's] _i think_ [what] [they] need _to do_ [is] stop building _more_ jails [and] _start_ giving stiffer sentences [uh] [but] _for_ [the] 
B|50| M: okay _i i_ [can] [start] off [at] this point [. [uh] [i] guess] _i'd_ [like] [to] [say] [that uh] [uh the] problems [with] capital punishment [in the] united states [are] _that that [you_ know] [it's] [so] easy [to] kill _somebody_ simply _because they're_ [you're] [they're] [a] violent person . 
A|51| A: [that] _would be_ certainly [be] [a] deterrent . 
B|52| M: [i mean] [i] _don't_ [know] [it it] seems [like] [it] [would be] [so] [so] stupid [that you] wouldn't _do something_ . 
A|53| A: [and] [uh] [not] necessarily [you know] [give] [in] [to] [their uh] human rights desires . [you _know] _if_ they're_ overcrowded _just_ keep cramming them [in] [there] till [they] _just_ suffocate [. uh] 
B|54| M: [uh] [that's] true . 
A|55| A: [uh _i] think_ they'd [have] [to] [go] [to] extra measures [to] make [sure] [a] person's guilty [you know] _in a lot of_ _cases ._ course [i [i] know] _you can't_ [be] [a] hundred percent foolproof . 
B|56| M: _yeah [i_ mean] [i] _don't_ [know] [. [i] mean] [i] [uh] . 
A|57| A: [uh] 
B|58| M: [but] _you can_ [be] completely innocent [in] [some] [cases .] 
A|59| A: [i'd] rather [see] [it] [a] little bit harder [and] [have] [a] little bit _more_ evidence [uh] [to] convict [somebody] 
B|60| M: [right] [i] agree . 
A|61| A: [and] _then_ those convicted especially [of] [you know] murder _and and_ [uh you know] major _crimes_ [uh] [to] reach [the] life sentences _and you know_ death penalties [and] follow-through _with that ._ 
B|62| M: _yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [uh] especially [you know] [in the] case [of] murder 
B|64| M: _right ._ 
A|65| A: [uh [i] know] [in] [my] case [i] [my] wife [and] daughter were kidnapped during [a] _house_ robbery _back in_ eighty-five 
B|66| M: [oh] [my] . 
A|67| A: [and] [we] caught [the] individuals _got_ caught [we] [uh] [we] went through [the] court system [and] [all] [that] sort [of] _thing_ 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: [and] [uh you know] two counts [of] kidnapping [uh _you know] the the_ forty-five [to the] head [you know] _just_ [the the] mental anguish [and _the] whole_ nine yards [uh _you know] the_ _guy_ only _got_ five years . 
B|70| M: _yeah ._ 
A|71| A: _and you know_ _he_ _was_ [out] within two months [because] [of the] parole system . [so] [what what] 
B|72| M: [yeah] [well] [that's] _that that_ [is] true [. [i] i] _don't_ [know if] [that] [i mean] [i] [uh] . 
A|73| A: [do] [what] [now] ? 
B|74| M: okay . 
A|75| A: [no . [i'm] not] real familiar _with that ._ 
B|76| M: [i] [was] going [to] [say] [we] [got] [a] [guy] [from] maryland _who_ did [that] [to] [our] son's volleyball net _and he_ [got] [he] [got] [three] point seven . 
A|77| A: _oh ._ 
B|78| M: [but] [you know] _it's not_ [it] wouldn't [be] legal 
A|79| A: [well] [the] insurance companies [and] [all] [that] tried [to] tried [to] [go] after _him_ _and they_ _said_ _well [you_ know] [he] [they're] [he] has [no] job [he] has nothing there's nothing [that] [he] has [that that you] could [go] after . 
B|80| M: _right ._ 
A|81| A: [yeah [.] uh] very 
B|82| M: [you know] [that] [i mean] [i] _don't_ [know] [it's] [it just] seems [like] [it's] _so [you_ can't] [say] [you] [just] [can't] [do] [it] _you don't_ [have the] authority [you] [you] [have [the] the] authority [to do] [it] . 
A|83| A: [yeah .] [they] [don't] [do] [that] [here] . course [they] _pay_ them [but] [they] [don't] [you don't] [you] [or] [the] insurance companies never [see] _any_ [of] [that] _money_ . 
B|84| M: [no] [they] don tinker [with that .] [that's] [that's] [the whole] [thing] . [and [and] they] don [they] put [uh they] put [in a lot of] [uh] [a lot] [more] [money] [for] [for] [uh] [their] causes . 
A|85| A: [and] [uh you know] [and] [they're] [right] [now] [they're] reluctant [to] [go] after _him_ [because they're] [you know] [they're] [they're] repeat offenders [they] [uh] _been_ [in] jail before 
B|86| M: [yeah] 
A|87| A: they've _been_ released [you know] several _times_ which [is] [another] [uh] deal _i hate_ [to] [see .] 
B|88| M: [uh _and] [you know the_ the] [other] [thing] [that] [i hate] [about] [the] news [you] hear [so] much [about] [the] number [of] violent [crimes] [that are] committed [you] [you] [say] [you're] glad [that] [there] [are] [you] [said] [there] [are] [more] than [one] person [you] [are] glad [that] [somebody] [is] doing [that] crime [but] [you] wonder [how] [many] [times] [have] [you] heard [of people] being killed [or you] [have] [you] seen _these_ [uh] 
A|89| A: [but [uh] you know] basically [the] [guy] commits [you know] [three] major [crimes] [and and] [uh and] [car] theft _on_ top [of] [it] destroys [my] [car] 
B|90| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|91| A: [and] [we're] [out] [you know] [uh you know] fifteen thousand dollars [and you know the] [guy] gets [out] [in] two months 
B|92| M: [yeah .] 
A|93| A: [and he] goes _out and_ commits [it] again . fact _he's_ _back in_ jail [now] . [so] [what what] [uh] 
B|94| M: what's [the] latest crime you've seen ? 
A|95| A: [yeah .] [what what] deterrent does [he] really [have] ? 
B|96| M: [well you] [you don't] hear [you] hear too much [on] [the] news [about] [him] being [out and] [about] [you] [think] [well] [he] may [have] [just] [been] [out] [of [the] country] _for a while_ [and [and] that] [he's] doing _something_ [to] _try to_ [get] [back [in] the] [neighborhood .] 
A|97| A: [yeah _i] think_ [in] [our] [in] [our] particular [neighborhood] vigilantism [is] becoming [a] real real possibility . 
B|98| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|99| A: [uh] we've [had a] couple instances where break ins where [the people] [have] [actually] [you know] shot [the people] 
B|100| M: [uh] . 
A|101| A: [and] [uh] return offenders [have] they've [actually] waited [for] them where they've robbed [you know] particular [neighborhood] they'll rob [one] _house_ _then_ [other] [people] will wait up [you know] [and] wait [for] [somebody] [to [do] something] _else_ [try to] [take] [it] [in] [their] own hands . 
B|102| M: [oh .] 
A|103| A: course [it] doesn't always work [out] [in] [their] favor . 
B|104| M: [no .] 
A|105| A: [but uh] nevertheless _i think_ [people are] [just] getting fed up [and] saying [you know] [you can't] arrest [all] [of] us 
B|106| M: [that's] true . 
A|107| A: [you can] [you know] [you can] [get] [some] [of] us 
B|108| M: [yeah .] 
A|109| A: [you can't] [get] [all] [of] us . 
B|110| M: _yeah that's_ true . 
A|111| A: [uh and] [we're] beginning [to] [see] [more] [and] [more] [of] [that .] 
B|112| M: [yeah .] 
A|113| A: [yeah .] 
B|114| M: [but] [the people] [that are] going [to] steal [from] [you] [that are] [in the] [house] [they're] going [to] kill [somebody] [else] 
A|115| A: [yeah that's] [i mean] [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] [in] [we] [have] [had a] few [cases] where [the] [guy] has broken [in] [you know] during [the] middle [of the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|116| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|117| A: [and] [uh] [it] helps [for a while] 
B|118| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! ; !! funniest !! line !! [i] !! [you] !! [you] !! okay !! [well] !! nice !! [you] !! [that] !! [yeah] !! [one] !! [one] !! [and] !! hi !! [we] !! [have] !! this !!?!! remind !! [it] !! [all] !! [what] !! did !! this !! [how] !! xt !! auto !! sv !! 
A|119| A: [but] _then_ [just] [another] different set [of people] come [in] [and] most [of [the] people are] transients [from] [out] outside [of the] state . 
B|120| M: [yeah [i] _i] think [that_ uh] . 
A|121| A: [uh i] [would] [say] probably eighty percent [of] them [that are] caught [they're] [from] places [like] up [in] oklahoma [and] louisiana arkansas [you know] across [the the] border . 
B|122| M: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|123| A: [so [you] know] [people who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in] [our] town [or] whatever 
B|124| M: _right ._ 
A|125| A: [it's not] [many] [from] [the] local communities . 
B|126| M: [uh] uh-hue . 
A|127| A: [but uh] [it's] [a problem] _and [i_ i] [just] [i think that] [the] court systems need [to be] [more] accurate [in] [in] stiffer [in] [their] penalties 
B|128| M: [uh] 
A|129| A: [would be] [a] definite deterrent [and and] [uh] giving [the] [uh] police [uh] agencies [a] little bit [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] [when] [they] [when] [they] catch [these] [people] . 
B|130| M: [yeah i] 
A|131| A: [right .] 
B|132| M: [and i] [that's] [what] [i think] should happen [is] [if] [if] [they] [have the] [money] [to] [pay] [for] [it] [then] [they] should [have the] [right] [to] [to] enforce [it] . 
A|133| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|134| M: [if they're] [if they're] [a] habitual user [of] [any] kind [of] [drugs] [they can] lose [their] driver's license . 
A|135| A: [i know] [like] [in] [my] wife's case [they] made her feel [like] [the] criminal . 
B|136| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|137| A: [they] [they] went [to] [all] [all] ...
