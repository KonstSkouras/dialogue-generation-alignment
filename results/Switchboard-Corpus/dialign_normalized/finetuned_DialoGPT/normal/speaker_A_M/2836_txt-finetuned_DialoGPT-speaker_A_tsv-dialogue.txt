A|7| A: _about_ fifteen miles [. i] live [in a] little suburb [, _uh] ,_ which [is] _, i guess_ _from_ dallas [is] twelve miles [or] [so] 
B|8| M: uh-uh . 
A|9| A: [but] [it's] pretty congested . [we] [are] considered _in _the_ country_ , 
B|10| M: [uh] . 
A|11| A: [but] [it] doesn't really feel [like] _you're_ _in _the_ country_ . 
B|12| M: um _, well _,_ that's [,_ _that] , that_ [is] _a problem_ too , uh-homing [, uh] . 
A|13| A: _our_ major _crimes_ [in] _our_ immediate town [, _uh] ,_ [is] probably robberies , _house_ robberies [and] very few instances _of _,_ you know ,_ alcohol , _drugs [,_ _uh] ,_ reported . 
B|14| M:  !!! % 
A|15| A: however [, i'm] [sure] _they're_ [there] . 
B|16| M: _yeah _, i_ know_ _they_ [are] . 
A|17| A: [but , _uh] ,_ _right_ [now] _our_ _neighborhood_ [is] running _about [,_ _uh] ,_ eighty percent _of the_ homeowners [have] _been_ robbed , sometime during [their ,] [their , _uh] ,_ existence [in] [that] _neighborhood ._ 
B|18| M: _oh ,_ goodness . 
A|19| A: [and] since [that] _time_ everybody's _got_ _some_ sort [of] burglar system _or _, you_ know [,_ _uh] ,_ burglar alarms _uh , and_ including [the] _out_ [, _uh] , the_ outer perimeter type [, _uh] ,_ devices , sensors [and] things [like _that] ._ 
B|20| M: _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: [it's] cut _back_ _, you know ,_ considerably [, but] _it _, it_ just_ shifts [it] _from_ _our_ _neighborhood_ [to] [another] _neighborhood_ [to] _other_ _neighborhood_ _, so_ [it] still [, _uh] ,_ remains city wide , pretty , pretty high . 
B|22| M: _yeah ._ 
A|23| A: _uh , i_ _would_ _say_ [the] majority [of] [it's] happening during [the] day [, _uh] ,_ between probably ten _in the_ morning [and] _three_ _in the_ afternoon . 
B|24| M: _yeah ._ 
A|25| A: most , 
B|26| M: _well [,_ _i'm] not_ [sure] [. i] _don't_ [know] _what , what_ percentage [of the] voters _actually_ turn [out] [to] vote [. _i] _, i_ ,_ _we're_ supposed _to be_ talking [about] _people who_ turn [out] _at_ lunch [time] [to] vote [in the] evening . 
A|27| A: [well ,] most families , most families [are] young [and] both _people are_ working . 
B|28| M: _oh ,_ uh-hoh . 
A|29| A: [so] _they're_ happening during [the] hours _they're_ gone _from_ work . 
B|30| M: _right ._ 
A|31| A: _uh _,_ _so_ [,_ _uh] , i_ _would_ _say_ [that's] probably [their] prime motivation . they'll , they'll stock [your] _house_ _and [,_ _uh] ,_ look [at] [your] pattern [and] _then_ [go] _from_ [there] . 
B|32| M: _right ._ 
A|33| A: _uh _,_ they_ classify most [of] them as professionals . 
B|34| M: _yeah ._ 
A|35| A: _uh _,_ _you_ get_ [a] few [of] them _that are_ [a] little bit sloppier [, _uh] ,_ _just_ taking [, _uh] _,_ you know ,_ _just_ junk items [that] [they] _, they can_ _just_ _get_ _, you know ,_ ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ real quick . 
B|36| M: _right ._ 
A|37| A: probably [the] biggest items _that , _uh_ [,_ _that] _you_ get_ [in] _our_ _neighborhood_ , _or ,_ _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles [, [the] _,] you know ,_ mercedes , volvos , things [that] _they can_ _get_ _, you know ,_ [big] dollars _for_ _and the_ jewelry [are] [the] major targets , 
B|38| M: [uh] . 
A|39| A: guns [, that] sort [of] stuff . 
B|40| M: _yeah , that's_ true . 
A|41| A: very few _, you know ,_ penny , penny ante stuff . 
B|42| M: [uh , i] _see ._ 
A|43| A: [well [,] _uh] , the_ police force _, for_ [one] _, i think_ [they] could [, [uh] ,] definitely add _to the_ police force _and the_ type equipment [that] [they] use _. uh _,_ it's ,_ [oh ,] [right] [now] _i _think_ _,_ we_ [are] [about] thirty thousand [people] [and] there's only eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty _, for_ [that] amount _of people_ which [is] [not] very _many_ . 
B|44| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|45| A: _and ,_ 
B|46| M: [and the] _problem_ _with that_ [is] [that _, uh] you know_ _when_ [you get] into _the , the_ drug culture [, _the] people are_ selling [it] [to the] highest bidder . 
A|47| A: [well [,] [the] ,] course [in] _our_ particular state [, [uh] _,] we_ _have the_ prison overcrowding , whatever _, so_ _they're_ giving [the] early release [, [uh] ,] 
B|48| M: [uh ,] 
A|49| A: [yeah _,] and , and_ [it's _,] i think_ [what] [they] need _to do_ [is] stop building _more_ jails [and] _start_ giving stiffer sentences [, [uh] [,] but] _for_ [the ,] 
B|50| M: okay _, i , i_ [can] [start] off [at] this point [. [uh [,] i] guess] , _i'd_ [like] [to] [say] [that , uh] [uh , the] problems [with] capital punishment [in the] united states [are] _that , [that_ [,] you know [,] it's] [so] easy [to] kill _somebody_ simply _because they're ,_ [you're] _, they're_ [a] violent person . 
A|51| A: [that] _would be_ , certainly [be] [a] deterrent . 
B|52| M: [i mean [,] i] _don't_ [know [,] [it] , it] seems [like] [it] [would be] [so [,] so] stupid [that you] wouldn't _do something_ . 
A|53| A: _and [,_ [uh] ,] [not] necessarily [, you know ,] [give] [in] [to] [their , [uh] ,] human rights desires . [you know _,] if they're_ overcrowded , _just_ keep cramming them [in] [there] till [they] _just_ suffocate [. uh ,] 
B|54| M: [uh _,] that's_ true . 
A|55| A: [uh _, i] think_ they'd [have] [to] [go] [to] extra measures [to] make [sure] [a] person's guilty [, you know ,] _in a lot of_ _cases ._ course [, i [, i] know] _you can't_ [be] [a] hundred percent foolproof . 
B|56| M: _yeah [, i_ mean [,] i] _don't_ [know] [. [i] mean] [i [,] uh] . 
A|57| A: [uh ,] 
B|58| M: [but] _you can_ [be] completely innocent [in] [some] [cases .] 
A|59| A: [i'd] rather [see] [it] [a] little bit harder [and] [have] [a] little bit _more_ evidence [, [uh] _,] to_ convict [somebody] 
B|60| M: [right] [, i] agree . 
A|61| A: [and] _then_ those convicted , especially _of [,_ you know ,] murder _and _, and_ [,_ [uh] [,] you know ,] major _crimes_ [, [uh] _,] to_ reach [the] life sentences _and [,_ you know ,] death penalties [and] follow-through _with that ._ 
B|62| M: _yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [uh ,] especially [, you know ,] [in the] case [of] murder 
B|64| M: _right ._ 
A|65| A: [uh [, i] know] [in] [my] case [, i _,] my_ wife [and] daughter were kidnapped , during [a] _house_ robbery _back in_ eighty-five 
B|66| M: [oh [,] my] . 
A|67| A: [and] [we] caught [, the] individuals _got_ caught _, we_ [, [uh] _,] we_ went through [the] court system [and] [all] [that] sort [of] _thing_ 
B|68| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: _and [,_ [uh] [,] you know ,] two counts [of] kidnapping [, uh [you know] [,] [the] , the] forty-five [to the] head [, you know ,] _just_ [the , the] mental anguish [and _the] whole_ nine yards [uh [,] you know [,] the] _guy_ only _got_ five years . 
B|70| M: _yeah ._ 
A|71| A: _and [,_ you know _,] he_ _was_ [out] within two months [because] [of the] parole system . [so] [what , [what] ,] 
B|72| M: [yeah _,] well _,_ that's [,_ _that] , that_ [is] true [. [i] , i] _don't_ [know] [if] [that [,] i mean [,] i [,] uh] . 
A|73| A: [do] [what] [now] ? 
B|74| M: okay . 
A|75| A: [no . [i'm] not] real familiar _with that ._ 
B|76| M: [i] [was] going [to] [say] [, we] [got] [a] [guy] [from] maryland _who_ did [that] [to] [our] son's volleyball net _and he_ [got] [, he] [got] [three] point seven . 
A|77| A: _oh ._ 
B|78| M: [but [,] you know [,] _it's] not_ [, it] wouldn't [be] legal , 
A|79| A: [well [,] the] insurance companies [and] [all] [that] tried _to ,_ tried [to] [go] after _him_ _and they_ _said_ [, _well [,] you_ know [,] he] [, [they're] [,] he] has [no] job [, he] has nothing , there's nothing [that] [he] has [that , [that] you] could [go] after . 
B|80| M: _right ._ 
A|81| A: [yeah [.] uh ,] very 
B|82| M: [you know [,] [that] [,] i mean [,] i] _don't_ [know [,] it's [,] it just] seems [like] [it's] _so _, you_ can't_ [say] [, you] [just] [can't] [do] [it _,] you don't_ [have the] authority [, [you] [,] you] [have [the] , the] authority [to do] [it] . 
A|83| A: [yeah .] [they] [don't] [do] [that] [here] . course [they] _pay_ them [, but] [they] [don't] [, you don't] [, you] [or] [the] insurance companies never [see] _any_ [of] [that] _money_ . 
B|84| M: [no] [, they] don tinker [with that .] _that's _,_ that's_ [the whole] [thing] . [and , [and] they] don [, they] put [, uh] [they] put [in a lot [of] [,] uh] [a lot] [more] [money] [for] [, for] [, uh] [their] causes . 
A|85| A: [and [,] [uh] [,] you know [,] and] [they're] [right] [now] [they're] reluctant [to] [go] after _him_ [because they're [,] you know [,] [they're] [,] they're] repeat offenders [, they] [, [uh] ,] _been_ [in] jail before 
B|86| M: [yeah] 
A|87| A: they've _been_ released [, you know ,] several _times_ , which [is] [another] [, [uh] ,] deal _i hate_ [to] [see .] 
B|88| M: [uh , and] [you know] [the , the] [other] [thing] [that] [i hate] [about] [the] news [, you] hear [so] much [about] [the] number [of] violent [crimes] [that are] committed [, [you] [,] you] [say] , [you're] glad [that] [there] [are] [, you] [said] [there] [are] [more] than [one] person [, you] [are] glad [that] [somebody] [is] doing [that] crime [, but] [you] wonder [how] [many] [times] [have] [you] heard [of people] being killed [or , you] [have] [you] seen _these_ [, uh] 
A|89| A: [but , [uh] [,] you know ,] basically [the] [guy] commits [, you know] [three] major [crimes] [and _, and] [,_ [uh] , and] [car] theft _on_ top [of] [it ,] destroys [my] [car] , 
B|90| M: [uh ,] [yeah .] 
A|91| A: [and] [we're] [out] [, you know [,] [uh] [,] you know ,] fifteen thousand dollars [and [,] you know [,] the] [guy] gets [out] [in] two months 
B|92| M: [yeah .] 
A|93| A: [and he] goes _out and_ commits [it] again . fact , _he's_ _back in_ jail [now] . [so [,] [what] , [what] [,] [uh] ,] 
B|94| M: what's [the] latest crime you've seen ? 
A|95| A: [yeah .] [what , what] deterrent does [he] really [have] ? 
B|96| M: [well , [you] [,] you don't] hear [, you] hear too much [on] [the] news [about] [him] being [out and] [about [,] you] [think [,] well [,] he] may [have] [just] [been] [out] [of [the] country] _for a while_ [, and , [and] that] [he's] doing _something_ [to] _try to_ [get] [back [in] the] [neighborhood .] 
A|97| A: [yeah _, i] think_ [in] [our] , [in] [our] particular [neighborhood] , vigilantism [is] becoming [a] real , real possibility . 
B|98| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|99| A: [uh ,] we've [had a] couple instances where break ins where [the people] [have] [actually] [, you know ,] shot [the people] 
B|100| M: [uh] . 
A|101| A: [and [,] [uh] ,] return offenders [have] , they've [actually] waited [for] them , where they've robbed [, you know ,] particular [neighborhood] , they'll rob [one] _house _,_ then_ [other] [people] will wait up [, you know [,] and] wait [for] [somebody] [to [do] something] _else ,_ [try to] [take] [it] [in] [their] own hands . 
B|102| M: [oh .] 
A|103| A: course [it] doesn't always work [out] [in] [their] favor . 
B|104| M: [no .] 
A|105| A: [but , [uh] ,] nevertheless _, i think_ [people are] [just] getting fed up [and] saying [, you know [,] you can't] arrest [all] [of] us , 
B|106| M: [that's] true . 
A|107| A: [you can] [, you know [,] [you] can] [get] [some] [of] us , 
B|108| M: [yeah .] 
A|109| A: [you can't] [get] [all] [of] us . 
B|110| M: _yeah , that's_ true . 
A|111| A: [uh , and] [we're] beginning [to] [see] [more] [and] [more] [of] [that .] 
B|112| M: [yeah .] 
A|113| A: [yeah .] 
B|114| M: [but] [the people] [that are] going [to] steal [from] [you [,] [that] are] [in the] [house [,] they're] going [to] kill [somebody] [else ,] 
A|115| A: [yeah [, that's] [,] i mean] [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] , [in] [, we] [have] [had a] few [cases] where [the] [guy] has broken [in] [, you know ,] during [the] middle [of the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|116| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|117| A: [and [,] [uh] [,] it] helps [for a while] 
B|118| M:  !!! % !! remindme !! ; !! funniest !! line !! [i] !! [you] !! [you] !! okay !! [well] !! nice !! [you] !! [that] !! [yeah] !! [one] !! [one] !! [and] !! hi !! [we] !! [have] !! this !!?!! remind !! [it] !! [all] !! [what] !! did !! this !! [how] !! xt !! auto !! sv !! 
A|119| A: [but] _then_ [just] [another] different set [of people] come [in] [, and] most [of [the] people are] transients [from] [out] , outside [of the] state . 
B|120| M: [yeah [, i] _, i] think [that_ , uh] . 
A|121| A: [uh , i] [would] [say] probably eighty percent [of] them [that are] caught [, they're] [from] places [like] up [in] oklahoma [, and] louisiana , arkansas [, you know ,] across [the , the] border . 
B|122| M: [oh ,] [yeah .] 
A|123| A: [so [, you] know ,] [people who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in] [our] town [or] whatever 
B|124| M: _right ._ 
A|125| A: [it's not] [many] [from] [the] local communities . 
B|126| M: [uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|127| A: [but , [uh] [,] it's] [a problem] [, _and] [i ,_ i] [just] [, i think that] [the] court systems need [to be] [more] accurate [in] , [in] , stiffer [in] [their] penalties , 
B|128| M: [uh ,] 
A|129| A: [would be] [a] definite deterrent [and [, and] [,] [uh] ,] giving [the [,] [uh] ,] police [, [uh] ,] agencies [a] little bit [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] [when] [they] , [when] [they] catch [these] [people] . 
B|130| M: [yeah [, i] ,] 
A|131| A: [right .] 
B|132| M: [and i [,] that's] [what] [i think] should happen [is] [if] [, if] [they] [have the] [money] [to] [pay] [for] [it [,] then] [they] should [have the] [right] [to [,] to] enforce [it] . 
A|133| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|134| M: [if [they're] [,] if they're] [a] habitual user [of] [any] kind [of] [drugs [,] they can] lose [their] driver's license . 
A|135| A: [i know] [like] [in] [my] wife's case [, they] made her feel [like] [the] criminal . 
B|136| M: [uh ,] [yeah .] 
A|137| A: [they] [, they] went [to] [all] , [all] ...
