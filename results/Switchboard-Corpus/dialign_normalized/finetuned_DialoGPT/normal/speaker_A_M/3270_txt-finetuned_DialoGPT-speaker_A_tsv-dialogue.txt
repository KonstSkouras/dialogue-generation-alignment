B|10| M: right . 
A|11| A: [and] [the] only other avenue [that] [i] can [think] _of_ [is] [uh] looking at where _they're_ spending [the] money [and] [not] so much as saying _well_ _we're_ spending [too] much [in] [that] area as perhaps looking at _what_ [is] costing them [the] money . as for for instance [i think you] _probably_ remember [the] military getting caught _um_ with toilet seats [that] cost them four hundred five hundred dollars . 
B|12| M: [uh] right . 
A|13| A: [and [it] was] [just] _i mean_ [you] can go _to_ k-mart [and] buy them for [uh] eight dollars or [i think] six dollars or whatever for toilet seats 
B|14| M: right right . 
A|15| A: so . so [it] gives [you] idea [that]

A|17| A: sure sure . so 
B|18| M: [i mean] 
A|19| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|20| M: [but um] . 
A|21| A: than we [think] . sure . sure . 
B|22| M: _but uh_ . 
A|23| A: uh-huh . [it] sure _is ._ [the] [you know] as far as [i think] there [was] something with [the] [government] official [that] went on conferences for two days [and] actually [uh the] conferences [were] nothing [but [uh] you know] _they're_ getting paid for this [and [it] was] something more than [just] [the] conferences . _they_ [were] using [it] as eating out [uh] [when] [you think about] people [uh] taking vacations these [big] [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|24| M: oh yeah . 
A|25| A: [the] rest _of_ them taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' money for [that] . 
B|26| M: right . right . 
A|27| A: [and [it's] a] real [big] crunch [uh] 
B|28| M: right right . 
A|29| A: _of_ course [when] _they_ get caught then _they're_ [you know] _they're_ guilty _of_ course [but uh] during [that] time _i'm_ sure there's hundreds _of_ [uh] thousands _of_ people [that] are [uh] spending money [that] does [not] belong [to] them . so 
B|30| M: yeah [that's] true . 
A|31| A: uh-huh . 
B|32| M: _and [i_ think] [they're] right [that] [uh] [that] [that] _a lot of_ times [they] [do] throw [in] [the] towel [the] wrong way . 
A|33| A: sure . 
B|34| M: [um i] guess [i'm] [a] little _bit_ [too] uh-hated [about] [the [uh] the] [the] [um i] _i don't know_ _i don't_ really [know] [what] [the] solution [to] [that] [is .] 
A|35| A: uh-huh . exactly . [and [i] don't] [think] [uh it's] ended up being [i mean] [it] gave people jobs 
B|36| M: yeah . 
A|37| A: [but] [i think] [it] also cost [um] quite [a] [bit] as far as [because] after [they're] done with [the] war [a lot of] things [were] no longer put [to] use . [i mean] [it was] kind [of] like [okay] we'll [do] this during this point [and] time [but] after [that] [that's] [you know] [uh] [they] didn't want [to] [do] [it] anymore . 
B|38| M: right . 
A|39| A: so [a lot of] things [that] are saying [that] [they're] no longer [going to] be doing for next wars [that] are coming up [that] [they] did for this one [in] getting rid [of] [a lot of] things . so [i don't [know] .] 
B|40| M: yeah [i think] [they're] [probably] right . 
A|41| A: [okay] [well] [it was] good [talking] [to] [you] [and] have [a] good evening . 
B|42| M: [well] [you] [too] . 
A|43| A: uh-huh thanks .
