A|1| A: there's [, uh ,] maybe some short-term things [that] _they_ can _do_ [and it] hurts everybody's pocket , _of_ course , _but _, um_ , i_ [know] [that] state has [, uh ,] cutback [, uh ,] raises for [a] year _to_ help [, uh [, the] [, uh] ,] state financial or whatever [you] might want _to_ say _to_ get better _in_ [a] better condition .

B|8| M: [uh] . 
A|9| A: so [it] might have _to_ be something [that] _they_ might consider doing as [a] _that's_ got _to_ be very short term . 
B|10| M: right . 
A|11| A: [and] [the] only other avenue [that] [i] can [think] _of_ [is] [, uh ,] looking at where _they're_ spending [the] money [and] [not] so much as saying , _well ,_ _we're_ spending [too] much [in] [that] area as perhaps looking at _what_ [is] costing them [the] money . as for , for instance _, i think_ [you] _probably_ remember [the] military getting caught _, um ,_ with toilet seats [that] cost them four hundred , five hundred dollars . 
B|12| M: [uh ,] right .

B|22| M: _but , uh_ . 
A|23| A: uh-huh . [it] sure _is ._ [the [,] you know ,] as far as _, i think_ there [was] something with [the] [government] official [that] went on conferences for two days [and] actually [, uh , the] conferences [were] nothing [but [, uh] [,] you know ,] _they're_ getting paid for this [, [and] [it] was] something more than [just] [the] conferences . _they_ [were] using [it] as eating out [, uh ,] [when] [you think about] people [, uh ,] taking vacations these [big] [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|24| M: oh , yeah . 
A|25| A: [the] rest _of_ them taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' money for [that] . 
B|26| M: right . right . 
A|27| A: [and [it's] a] real [big] crunch [, uh] 
B|28| M: right , right . 
A|29| A: _of_ course , [when] _they_ get caught then _they're_ [, you know ,] _they're_ guilty _of_ course , [but [, uh] ,] during [that] time _i'm_ sure there's hundreds _of_ [, uh ,] thousands _of_ people [that] are [, uh ,] spending money [that] does [not] belong [to] them . so , 
B|30| M: yeah , [that's] true . 
A|31| A: uh-huh . 
B|32| M: _and [i_ think] [they're] right , [that [,] uh] [that ,] [that] _a lot of_ times [they] [do] throw [in] [the] towel [the] wrong way . 
A|33| A: sure . 
B|34| M: [um , i] guess [i'm] [a] little _bit_ [too] , uh-hated [about] [the , uh] [the [,] the [,] um , i] [, _i] don't [know_ [,] _i] don't_ really [know] [what] [the] solution [to] [that] [is .] 
A|35| A: uh-huh . exactly . [and [i] don't] [think [,] uh [,] it's] ended up being [, [i] mean] [it] gave people jobs 
B|36| M: yeah . 
A|37| A: [but] [i think] [it] also cost [, um ,] quite [a] [bit] as far as [because] after [they're] done with [the] war , [a lot of] things [were] no longer put [to] use . [i mean] [it was] kind [of] like [, okay] , we'll [do] this during this point [and] time [but] after [that] [that's] [, you know [,] uh] [they] didn't want [to] [do] [it] anymore . 
B|38| M: right . 
A|39| A: so , [a lot of] things [that] are saying [that] [they're] no longer [going to] be doing for next wars [that] are coming up [that] [they] did for this one [in] getting rid [of] [a lot of] things . so [i don't [know] .] 
B|40| M: yeah [, i think] [they're] [probably] right . 
A|41| A: [okay] , [well [,] it was] good [talking] [to] [you] [and] have [a] good evening .
