B|42| M: _and_ [uh] 
A|43| A: no . 
B|44| M: [i] don't [i] donno what _the_ solution is [to] [that .] 
A|45| A: [well] great . [that's] excellent . 
B|46| M: yeah . 
A|47| A: [well] [uh] if [a lot of] people _did that_ [then] _we_ wouldn't [have] [a lot _of] this_ junk mail . _that's a_ great idea _. i_ hadn't thought [about] [that] [and] _we_ might _be able to_ incorporate [some] [of] [that .] _one_ thing 
B|48| M: [well] we're we're doing [that .] we're doing [it] [in] [all] _the_ schools _too_ so . 
A|49| A: right .
