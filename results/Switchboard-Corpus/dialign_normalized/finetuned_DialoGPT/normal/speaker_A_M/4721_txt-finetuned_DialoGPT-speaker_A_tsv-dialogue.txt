B|20| M: _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: _so_ _i've enjoyed_ _that_ part [of] [it .] [yeah .] [and] at [the] gym even [in the] [class] [uh i] _it's_ not _really_ [a] group where [you] chat [a] lot . everybody's on their way [to] someplace 
B|22| M: _yeah [yeah_ .] 
A|23| A: _and so_ _you know_ _i do_ [have] one _friend_ who goes occasionally 
B|24| M: _uh-huh_ . 
A|25| A: [but] basically _i do_ [it] by myself [in a] group [of] maybe forty _so ._ 
B|26| M: [yeah .] 
A|27| A: there are there are . _it's_ _more_ motivating _that_ way _i think_ . [yeah .] 
B|28| M: _because_ [it's] [like] [it's] [it] [really] [is] . 
A|29| A: [you] _could get_ [a] tape probably [and] [do] [it] at home [in] front [of the] t v [but] [you] probably wouldn't .

A|37| A: _right ._ 
B|38| M: [and uh i] [uh] . 
A|39| A: [uh-huh] 
B|40| M: [and so [i] think] _that's_ [good] [too] . 
A|41| A: [i think] [you] [do] . [you] feel very [good] after [you] [exercise] [. [i] think] [it's] worth making [the] time for yourself . 
B|42| M: [uh] [yeah [.] i] [uh [i] have a] [friend] who's [a] [uh] [a] [a] nurse [and] [she] has [to] _take_ [her] little girl [to] [uh] [to] [to] 
A|43| A: [you] owe [it] [to] yourself 
B|44| M: [yeah] _that's_ true . 
A|45| A: [and] [i think] [you] [do] accomplish _more_ after [that] . 
B|46| M: _that's_ [right .] 
A|47| A: [and] [i think] [that] _it's _just_ is_ [good] for your self-esteem for everything [because] when [you] look better [you] feel better [and] _it's just_ [uh [i] think] [it's] [well] worth [it [.] i] [just] demand [that] time for myself . now [i've] learned [to [do] that] 
B|48| M: [yeah i] [i do] [the] same thing . 
A|49| A: [and] _you know_ [and] [it's] _i think _it_ just_ benefits [you] all around . [so .] 
B|50| M: [well] [i'm] [i] [i] [know] [that] [uh] 
A|51| A: [you] [have] [to] . [because] there's [always] _more_ things [to do] . 
B|52| M: [i think it] [would] [be] [nice] if [we] [could get] [more] people involved [in the] work force 
A|53| A: there [is] [always] things [that] [you] can make priority [to] [it] [but i] [just] [i don't] demand [a] lot for myself [and so] _you know_ [i] [just] feel entitled [to] [it] 
B|54| M: [uh-huh] . 
A|55| A: [and] [i] [take] [it] [so .] 
B|56| M: [well] [it's just] [you know] [it's] [it is] [just] [a] [it [just] is] [a] problem . 
A|57| A: [no i've] done some walking with friends [in the] past . 
B|58| M: [uh-huh] . 
A|59| A: [but i] find [that] when [you] [do that] [you] [do] [more] chatting than [you] [do] [exercise] 
B|60| M: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: [and] [that's] not [really] beneficial [so] [uh [i] don't] [have] time [like] [that] 
B|62| M: [yeah] [well] [that's] [good .] 
A|63| A: [and] [i] spend [enough] time chatting around everywhere [you know]
