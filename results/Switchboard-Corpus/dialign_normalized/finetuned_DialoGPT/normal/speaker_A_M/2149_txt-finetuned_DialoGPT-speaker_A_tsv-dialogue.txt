B|76| M: [yeah _,] _it ,_ it_ [really] [is] . 
A|77| A: [we had] [, uh , [we] had] organizations like [that] [in] college [, you _know] _._ [we_ had] [a] community service group [in] college [that] [had] [all] sorts [of] different groups [and] some did like [that ,] some did elderly visits , 
B|78| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: some did [, uh ,] some did [, you _know] ,_ _big_ brother , _big_ sister , stuff like [that .] [and] [i'm] convinced [that [, that] , that] [at] least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] _a ,_ some sort [of] group . [you _know] ,_ activity like [that .] 
B|80| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [you _know] ._ twenty-five [, _i] don't know ._ twenty-five percent ? [a] asks someone else [in the] [yeah [,] my] wife _was_ _big_ [in] [that]

A|83| A: [and] she thinks [, [yeah] ,] twenty-five percent . _it , it was_ [a] small school 
B|84| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|85| A: [but [,] uh [,] [yeah] ,] [but [,] i] mean _, _a_ , _a_ , _a_ lot of_ people [would] get involved [and [,] you _know] ,_ [because] there were [all] different , organizations _to do_ . there _was_ _big_ brother , _big_ sister , 
B|86| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: _they_ [had] [a] yearly auction , _they_ [had] [a] dance marathon _for_ charity or , _to_ , _to_ support [that ,] group .

A|89| A: such [that [,] you _know] ,_ lots [of] people got involved [that] way . 
B|90| M: [well [,] that's great .] 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| M: [so [,] uh [,] it's] _, [it [,_ it was] [,] it] [had [to] _be] [a_ lot of] fun . 
A|93| A: [yeah _,] no ,_ neither _do_ [i] _. [i_ think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you _know] ._ 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [yeah ,] they're not worth [a] year . or some people [just , just] can't even afford [it [,] you _know] ,_ whatever _. i_ mean , [the] peace corps doesn't _pay_ very [well] . [you know] ? 
B|96| M: [no [,] i [, i] think] [they] [do [,] i] [do] [think] [they] [pay] [a little] bit _too_ _much_ . 
A|97| A: people get shipped off [and] then [, you _know] _,_ and_ then _, and_ then their parents [, i] [have] _a [,_ uh _,] _a_ , a_ friend whose , whose son [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala , or daughter [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|99| A: [and [,] you _know] ,_ he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and [,] you _know] _, i_ know_ [i] could never afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] guatemala .

B|104| M: [no [,] no [,] no] . 
A|105| A: [so] [i] can see where [that [, that] ,] may [be [a] problem .] 
B|106| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|107| A: [just] take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: _yeah [, i_ [know] [, i] think] [that's] [a , [a] big] [problem] [, and [i] think it's [a] big] [part of] [it] _too ._ 
A|109| A: [yeah , _i] don't_ , 
B|110| M: [i don't know .] 
A|111| A: [yeah [,] _yeah] , well_ neither can [i ,] [so [,] i [, i] [, i] [, i] [, i] [, i] ,] did [my] service before [and] i'll [do] [my] [little] community service throughout , [but] never never _for_ [a] year again . 
B|112| M: [uh-huh .]

B|118| M: [it's] hard [to] find [time] [for] [all] [of] us . 
A|119| A: [we] got _lucky _._ [we_ had] [no] damage [to] our _house_ or anything [so ,] [the] rest will [just] [have] [to] come [with] [time] . 
B|120| M: [yeah , [well] , we] , [we've been] [lucky [.] [i] guess] [, i guess] [we're] [just] [lucky] [to have] [been] able [to do] [that [.] we] [, uh , we] bought [a] [new] [house] [about] [two] [and] [a] [half] years ago . 
A|121| A: [well ,] [good luck] [to] [you] [, too .]
