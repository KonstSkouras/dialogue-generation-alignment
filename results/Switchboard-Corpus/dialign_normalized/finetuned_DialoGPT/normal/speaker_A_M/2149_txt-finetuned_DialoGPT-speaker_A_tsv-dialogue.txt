B|76| M: [yeah] _it it_ [really] [is] . 
A|77| A: [we had] [uh [we] had] organizations like [that] [in] college [you _know] _._ [we_ had] [a] community service group [in] college [that] [had] [all] sorts [of] different groups [and] some did like [that] some did elderly visits 
B|78| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: some did [uh] some did [you know] _big_ brother _big_ sister stuff like [that .] [and] [i'm] convinced [that [that] that] [at] least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] [a] some sort [of] group . [you know] activity like [that .] 
B|80| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [you _know] ._ twenty-five _i don't know ._ twenty-five percent ? [a] asks someone else [in the] [yeah] [my] wife _was_ _big_ [in] [that] 
B|82| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|83| A: [and] she thinks [yeah] twenty-five percent . _it it was_ [a] small school 
B|84| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|85| A: [but] [uh] [yeah] [but] [i] mean _a _a_ _a_ lot of_ people [would] get involved [and] [you know] [because] there were [all] different organizations _to do_ . there _was_ _big_ brother _big_ sister 
B|86| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: _they_ [had] [a] yearly auction _they_ [had] [a] dance marathon _for_ charity or _to_ _to_ support [that] group . 
B|88| M: [oh] . 
A|89| A: such [that] [you know] lots [of] people got involved [that] way . 
B|90| M: [well] [that's great .] 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| M: [so] [uh] [it's] [it it was] [it] [had [to] _be] [a_ lot of] fun . 
A|93| A: [yeah] [no] neither _do i_ _. [i_ think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you _know] ._ 
B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [yeah] they're not worth [a] year . or some people [just just] can't even afford [it] [you know] whatever _. i_ mean [the] peace corps doesn't _pay_ very [well] . [you know] ? 
B|96| M: [no] [i [i] think] [they] [do i] [do] [think] [they] [pay] [a little] bit _too_ _much_ . 
A|97| A: people get shipped off [and] then [you know] [and] then [and] then their parents [i] [have] [a] [uh] _a a_ friend whose whose son [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala or daughter [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|99| A: [and] [you know] he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and] [you _know] _i_ know i_ could never afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] guatemala .

A|101| A: [you know] [so] 
B|102| M: [yeah .]

B|104| M: [no] [no] [no] . 
A|105| A: [so] [i] can see where [that that] may [be [a] problem .] 
B|106| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|107| A: [just] take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: _yeah [i_ know [i] think] [that's] [a [a] big] [problem] [and [i] think it's [a] big] [part of] [it] _too ._

A|119| A: [we] got _lucky _._ [we_ had] [no] damage [to] our _house_ or anything [so] [the] rest will [just] [have] [to] come [with] [time] . 
B|120| M: [yeah [well] we] [we've been] [lucky [.] [i] guess] [i guess] [we're] [just] [lucky] [to have] [been] able [to do] [that [.] we] [uh we] bought [a] [new] [house] [about] [two] [and] [a] [half] years ago . 
A|121| A: [well] [good luck] [to] [you too .]
