A|37| A: [yeah .] 
B|38| M: [so [i] don't know] _it's_ [it] seems [like] _it's_ _always_ [been] [the] new orleans giants [you]

B|40| M: [yeah] _they _did_ ._ 
A|41| A: _but _i_ know_ [that] [last year] _we_ [did] [go] _to _a baseball_ game_ [last year .] _we_ [got] free tickets _because_ someone [at] our church _one_ [of the] deacons [at] church [um] parks cars [at the] mansion [at] turtle creek which is [like] _one_ [of [the] uh] [the] places _and stuff_ . 
B|42| M: _oh [yeah_ .]

B|44| M: [yeah] _that's funny ._ 
A|45| A: [yeah] [he] makes _good_ money _too_ [doing] [that] you'd be [i was] shocked [but] anyway someone gave _an_ iranian [a] tip [of] four rangers tickets [last year] 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and then] [the] iranian couldn't [he] [didn't] _want_ [them] _so he_ gave [them] [to] alan [and] alan [and] his dad _had_ plans [that] night [so] [they] gave [them] [to] us _so he_ decided [that] some wealthy man tipped _this_ iranian [with] _baseball_ tickets 
B|48| M: [yeah .] 
A|49| A: [and] _we_ ended up [with] [them] [right .] [and] _so we_ were walking up

A|51| A: _and i_ looked [at] _my_ husband _and _i_ said_ [you know] what kyle _this_ is [the] mansion [at] turtle creek [a] tip [i] bet these _are_ [really] _good_ seats [and] _so we_ ended up on [first] base [right] [down] [there] on [the] floor 
B|52| M: [oh] [that's] _good ._ 
A|53| A: [oh yeah] _we_ [they] called us [at] _five_ [and] [the] [game] started [at] seven _so we_ [just] threw everything together ran [over] [and] [got] [the] tickets [and] walked [and] _so we_ took [two] _kids_ [with] us [and] nobody brings [two] children [in] these seats [you know] _because_ 
B|54| M: [that's] great . 
A|55| A: _yeah [and_ _you] just_ _sit_ [down] [and] all [the] girls were all dressed up [you know i] [just] [was] [there] _you know like_ [i'm] loaded [i'm] _here_ [you know] [and uh] _it was just_ _kind of_ [funny] _because_ [you know] [but] _we_ [got] [to] _sit_ by [first] base if [they did] hit _a ball_ [i] would _have_ [been] afraid [it] would _have_ knocked _my_ face [in] [you know] . 
B|56| M: [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .]

B|96| M: [oh] gosh . 
A|97| A: [they're] all real young [they're] [just] raised [right] [that's] what god's told [them] [to do] [but] [they're] [not] condemning [you] if [you] [we] [only] [have] _one_ child [you know] [they] [don't] [say] [they] [don't] put on bad _or_ [anything] which is [good] _because_ [it] would be easy [i'm] sure [for them] [to do] [that] [you get] [a] conviction [like] [that] [and you] [think] everyone should [have] [it .] [and] [so] [i'm] real proud [of them] _because_ [they're] aren't [really] [they] [don't] [do] [that] [at] all . 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: _you go in_ their bathroom [and] [there's] ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [and i] [always] give her [a] [hard] time whose toothbrush [did] [you] [really] use [this] morning 
B|100| M: [oh] [no] . 
A|101| A: [uh-huh .] [they] [live] lean [for] _one_ thing [and they] tithe [and they] [it] puts [a whole] [in] your money bag *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor god [with] [this] portion [and] [so] [they] [i think] [that] helps [a] [lot .] _i think [that's_ the] key [in] [he] [like] his sales [last year] [he] [just] works [a] normal job . [he] probably has _an_ income [of] thirty-five thousand [but] [last year] [he] made [that] [got] him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash [for a] full size van . [he] loves god [i mean] [it was] [the] biggest thing [that] any _one_ [in] [this] company _had_ [ever] done 
B|102| M: [uh] . 
A|103| A: [and he] [got] [to do] [it and] [so] god [just] [really] blesses him [in] ways [like] [that] [do] trust god _because_ [i don't know] _kids_ [are] [a] blessing _and and_ some people [you know] [we] [think] [of] blessings as nice furniture [and] things [like] [that] [but] _kids_ [are] [just] as [much] [of] [a] blessing inside these material things [but] [it's] [a] different [kind] [and] [a] [lot] [times] people [think] [oh] [well] [i'm not] blessed _i have_ _an_ old car . [but] you've [got] _five_ _kids_ [you know] 
B|104| M: [uh] _i know [i_ have] [i had a] [a] [uh] [i had] [an] oldsmobile [that] [i] bought used [for] [uh] ... 
A|105| A: [you're] [just] as blessed probably more _because_ if [you] follow [this] [there's] [a] [good] book called what [the] bible has [to] [say] about child training by richard fugate 
B|106| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|107| A: [and] [he's] [you know] [a] [lot] [of] wisdom [in] [it .] [and] [the] _kids_ [at] bible talk about [anything] [but] training [and] training is different than [anything] else [in in] psychology doesn't address [it .] [a] [lot] [of the] psychology [stuff] [the] [good] [stuff] [that's] [in] psychology [it] [just] comes [out of the] bible [and they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out [of] it] [but] [the] things [that] work [in] psychology other [the] [years] [that] [they've] proven [to] work [they] [just] come [out of the] bible [and] [so] [this] book [it] [just] [really] all these things [and] how [to] train [the] child [so] [they're] [not] [going to] be [a] curse [to] [you] when [they're] thirteen . 
B|108| M: [yeah [i] think that's] true . 
A|109| A: what [i mean] how [to] train [them] [so] [they're] [going to] be [a] blessing [and] [so] [you know] [they] [do] [that] [and they] [they] [just] [live] lean pretty [much] [they] [don't] she doesn't shop [at] foley's [you know] _and stuff_ [like] _that ._ [but] [a] [lot] women die _or_ shop [at] foley's [so] things 
B|110| M: [yeah .] 
A|111| A: [it's] _like a_ macy's [kind of] [store] 
B|112| M: [right .] 
A|113| A: [it's] pretty nice [and] everything's pretty expensive [and [you] [know] [you] just] [can't do] [that] [and you] [don't] [go] [to] [baseball] games as [much] _or_ [you get] pictures [like] [we] [did .] [you know] what [i mean] ? 
B|114| M: [yeah] [i'm not] [i [i] think] [i was] [i] went [to] [one] [i guess] [it was] [like a] [a] [year] [or] [so] ago [and i] went [and] bought [a] [like a] membership [at the] dollar [store] [and [and] _then] you_ [you go] [and you] buy [like a] pair [of] shoes [and stuff] [and _then] [you_ go in] [and] buy [like] [like] maybe maybe [five] dollars worth [of] merchandise . 
A|115| A: [you] [do] these fun things [you know] [in] other kinds [of] ways [and [i] know] manhattan's real expensive [but] [um] [it's] [kind of] [a] different situation _because_ [you're] probably living [in] [an] apartment [right] ? 
B|116| M: [right] [right .] 
A|117| A: [yeah .] 
B|118| M: [you know] we're [in] [a] town home [here] [in] plano _and it's_ [it] [it was] [it] [really] [was] difficult [to] move [because] [there] [was] [so] many [kids] [in the] neighborhood . 
A|119| A: [well] church softball leagues [so] 
B|120| M: [right .] 
A|121| A: [they're] [not] all boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have a] girls' league [because] [i'm] [the] [one] [that's] supposed [to] start [one] [and i] [just] haven't gotten around [to] [doing [it] .] [i] keep saying [we] need [to have] [one] . [they] [go] [okay] [then] start [one] . [but] everybody wants [to do] [it] [but] [you know] god's [sitting] on [my] heart [and i] [just] hadn't gotten around [to] [doing it] [but] anyway [so] [they] could [really] [only] [have] four members on [the] team . [i think] [they] [only] [have] four boys . [i don't] [even] [think] [they] [have] [but] [two] old enough [to] play yet . 
B|122| M: [uh] 
A|123| A: [but] [um] [then you] [didn't] believe _me_ about her [kids] *listen: [this] [and] utt2 as [one] utt [are] [the] [they] [are] [so] [good .] [i'm not] kidding [you] [but] she does work [with] [them [and] it's] [a] commitment [and that] [that's] what [they're] called [to do] . 
B|124| M: [yeah .] 
A|125| A: [i [have] a] most [of] [my] friends 
B|126| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|127| A: [i know i] [do] [too] [i] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four [kids] [and they] feel [like [you] know] [that's] [really] why god [and] some [of the] people [in] our church use birth control [and] some [of them] [don't] [i had] [my] tubes tied [so] [you]
