B|32| M: _well _,_ they're_ , _they've_ _only_ [been] _doing it_ [for a] couple [of] _years ._

B|44| M: [yeah _,] _that's_ funny ._ 
A|45| A: [yeah [,] he] makes _good_ money _too_ [doing] [that] , you'd be [i was] shocked _, but_ anyway , someone gave _an_ iranian [a] tip [of] four rangers tickets [last year] , 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and then] [the] iranian couldn't [, he] [didn't] _want_ [them] [, _so] he_ gave [them] [to] alan [, and] alan [and] his dad _had_ plans [that] night [so] [they] gave [them] [to] us [, _so] he_ decided [that] some wealthy man tipped _this_ iranian [, with] _baseball_ tickets , 
B|48| M: [yeah .] 
A|49| A: [and] _we_ ended up [with] [them] _, right ._ [and] _so we_ were , walking up

A|51| A: _and i_ looked [at] _my_ husband _and _i_ said [,_ you know] what kyle _this_ is [the] mansion [at] turtle creek [a] tip [i] bet these _are_ [really] _good_ seats [and] _so we_ ended up on [first] base [right] [down] [there] on [the] floor , 
B|52| M: [oh _,] that's_ _good ._ 
A|53| A: [oh _, yeah] ,_ _we_ [they] called us [at] _five_ [and] [the] [game] started [at] seven _so we_ [just] threw everything together , ran [over] [and] [got] [the] tickets [and] walked [and] _so we_ took [two] _kids_ [with] us [and] nobody brings [two] children [in] these seats [, you know] _because_ , 
B|54| M: [that's] great . 
A|55| A: _yeah [, and_ _you] just_ _sit_ [down] [and] all [the] girls were all dressed up [you know , i] [just] [was] [there] _, you know , like_ [i'm] loaded [, i'm] _here_ [, you know [,] [and] , uh _,] _it was_ just_ _kind of_ [funny] _because_ [, you know _,] but_ _we_ [got] [to] _sit_ by [first] base if [they did] hit _a ball_ [i] would _have_ [been] afraid [it] would _have_ knocked _my_ face _in [,_ you know] . 
B|56| M: [yeah .] 
A|57| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .]

A|65| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [so we] went [to a [baseball] [,] and] _i'm not_ [really] [a] big [baseball] fan 
A|67| A: [that's funny .] 
B|68| M: [it was just] _like _, you_ just_ [go] [and] [sit] [there] [and he] tries [to] eat _it [,_ you] _can't do_ [anything .] [he's like ,] gee , [you're] eating [too] [much] . 
A|69| A: [you] miss [the] [whole] thing .

A|95| A: [no ,] your _, i [have_ a] friend now [that] has seven . [and [,] um] [, and] [they're] all eight [and] under [, and] nine [and] under , 
B|96| M: [oh ,] gosh . 
A|97| A: [they're] all real young [, they're] [just] raised [right] [that's] what god's told [them] [to do] [but] [they're] [not] condemning [you ,] if [you ,] [we] [only] [have] _one_ child [, you know [,] they] [don't] [say [,] they] [don't] put on bad _or_ [anything] which is [good] _because_ [it] would be easy [, i'm] sure , [for them] [to do] [that] [, you get] [a] conviction [like] [that] [and you] [think] everyone should [have] [it .] [and] [so] [i'm] real proud [of them] _because_ [they're] aren't [really [,] they] [don't] [do] [that] [at] all . 
B|98| M: [yeah .] 
A|99| A: _you go in_ their bathroom [and] [there's] ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [and i] [always] give her [a] [hard] time whose toothbrush [did] [you] [really] use [this] morning 
B|100| M: [oh [,] no] . 
A|101| A: [uh-huh .] [they] [live] lean [for] _one_ thing [and they] tithe [and they] [it] puts [a whole] [in] your money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor god [with] [this] portion [and] [so] [they] _, i think_ [that] helps [a] [lot .] _i think [that's_ the] key [, in] [he [,] like] his sales [last year] [he] [just] works [a] normal job . [he] probably has _an_ income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] [last year] [he] made [that] [got] him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash [for a] full size van . [he] loves god [, i mean _,] it was_ [the] biggest thing [that] any _one_ [in] [this] company _had_ [ever] done , 
B|102| M: [uh] . 
A|103| A: [and he] [got] [to do] [it] [and] [so] god [just] [really] blesses him [in] ways [like] [that] , [do] trust god _because_ [, i don't know ,] _kids_ [are] [a] blessing _and , and_ some people [you know ,] [we] [think] [of] blessings as nice furniture [and] things [like] [that] [, but] _kids_ [are] [just] as [much] [of] [a] blessing inside these material things [but] [it's] [a] different [kind] [and] [a] [lot] [times] people [think ,] [oh [,] well _,] i'm not_ blessed _i have_ _an_ old car . [but] you've [got] _five_ _kids_ [, you know ,] 
B|104| M: [uh [,] _i know] [, i_ have] [, i had [a] [,] [a] [,] uh] [i had] [an] oldsmobile [that] [i] bought used [for] [, uh] ... 
A|105| A: [you're] [just] as blessed , probably more , _because_ if [you] follow [this] , [there's] [a] [good] book called what [the] bible has [to] [say] about child training , by richard fugate 
B|106| M: [uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|107| A: [and] [he's] [, you know [,] a] [lot] [of] wisdom [in] [it .] [and] [the] _kids_ [at] bible talk about [anything] [but] training [, and] training is different than [anything] else [in , in] psychology doesn't address [it .] [a] [lot] [of the] psychology [stuff ,] [the] [good] [stuff] [that's] [in] psychology [it] [just] comes [out of the] bible [and they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out [of] [it] [,] but] [the] things [that] work [in] psychology other [the] [years] [that] [they've] proven [to] work [, they] [just] come [out of the] bible [and] [so] [this] book [it] [just] [really] all these things [and] how [to] train [the] child [so] [they're] [not] [going to] be [a] curse [to] [you] when [they're] thirteen . 
B|108| M: [yeah [, [i] think] that's] true . 
A|109| A: what [i mean] how [to] train [them] [so] [they're] [going to] be [a] blessing [and] [so [,] you know [,] they] [do] [that] [and they] [, they] [just] [live] lean pretty [much] [they] [don't] , she doesn't shop [at] foley's [you know [,] _and] stuff_ [like] _that ._ [but] [a] [lot] women die _or_ shop [at] foley's [so] things , 
B|110| M: [yeah .] 
A|111| A: [it's] _like a_ macy's , [kind of] [store] , 
B|112| M: [right .] 
A|113| A: [it's] pretty nice [and] everything's pretty expensive [and [,] you [know [,] you] just] [can't do] [that] [and you] [don't] [go] [to] [baseball] games as [much] _or_ [you get] pictures [like] [we] [did .] [you know] what [i mean] ? 
B|114| M: [yeah [,] i'm [not] [,] i [, i] [think] [,] [i] was] [, i] went [to] [one] [, [i] guess] [it was] [like [a] [,] a] [year] [or] [so] ago [and i] went [and] bought [a [,] [like] a] membership [at the] dollar [store] [and , [and] then] [, [you] [,] [you] go] [and you] buy [like a] pair [of] shoes [and stuff] [and _then] [you_ go in] [and] buy [like [,] [like] ,] maybe , maybe [five] dollars worth [of] merchandise . 
A|115| A: [you] [do] these fun things [, you know [,] in] other kinds [of] ways [and [i] know] manhattan's real expensive [but [,] um] [, it's] [kind of] [a] different situation _because_ [you're] probably living [in] [an] apartment _, right_ ? 
B|116| M: [right] [, right .] 
A|117| A: [yeah .] 
B|118| M: [you know ,] we're [in] [a] town home [here] [in] plano [, _and] it's_ [, [it] [,] it was] [, it] [really] [was] difficult [to] move [because] [there] [was] [so] many [kids] [in the] neighborhood . 
A|119| A: [well ,] church softball leagues [, [so] ,] 
B|120| M: [right .] 
A|121| A: [they're] [not] all boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have a] girls' league [because] [i'm] [the] [one] [that's] supposed [to] start [one] [and i] [just] haven't gotten around [to] [doing [it] .] [i] keep saying [we] need [to have] [one] . [they] [go] , [okay] , [then] start [one] . [but] everybody wants [to do] [it] [but [,] you know ,] god's [sitting] on [my] heart [and i] [just] hadn't gotten around [to] [doing [it] [,] but] anyway [, so] [they] could [really] [only] [have] four members on [the] team . [i think] [they] [only] [have] four boys . [i don't] [even] [think] [they] [have] [but] [two] old enough [to] play yet . 
B|122| M: [uh ,] 
A|123| A: [but [,] um] , [then you] [didn't] believe _me_ about her [kids] *listen: [this] [and] utt2 as [one] utt [are] [the] [they] [are] [so] [good .] [i'm not] kidding [you] [but] she does work [with] [them [and] it's] [a] commitment [and ,] [that] [, that's] what [they're] called [to do] . 
B|124| M: [yeah .] 
A|125| A: [i [have] [a] ,] most [of] [my] friends , 
B|126| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|127| A: [i know , i] [do] [too] [, i ,] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four [kids] [and they] feel [like [, you] know [,] that's] [really] why god [and] some [of the] people [in] our church use birth control [and] some [of them] [don't] [, i had] [my] tubes tied [so] [you ,]
