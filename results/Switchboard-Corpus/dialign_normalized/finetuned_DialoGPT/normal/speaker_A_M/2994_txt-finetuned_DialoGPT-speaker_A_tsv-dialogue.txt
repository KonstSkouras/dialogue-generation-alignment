B|0| M: _yeah ._ 
A|1| A: [yeah .] [yeah] my husband was complaining the other day _because_ he said every time _i_ turn around you're telling me _some_ new rule _about_ _recycling_ like yesterday _i_ was tell him _you_ have _to_ you're supposed _to_ squeeze the _plastic_ jugs before _you_ _take_ them up _there ._ 
B|2| M: _right ._ 
A|3| A: every time he turns around _i'm_ giving him _some_ new rule where you're supposed _to_ squish up the _you know_ like collapse the _plastic_ jugs . instead _of_ taking them up _there_ solid . 
B|4| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _and i_ wish _that_ our _recycling_ center took paper _bags_ . they won't _take_ _those_ . _we_ like _to_ _put_ our just _put_ our newspapers _in_ _a_ paper bag _you know_ _and then_ carry them up _there_ _that_ way . 
B|6| M: [yeah .] 
A|7| A: _and_ _we_ have _to_ bring the paper _bags_ back every time . _because_ they won't _take_ them . 
B|8| M: oh . 
A|9| A: _do_ _you_ _uh_ _take_ _your_ _papers_ somewhere or does someone pick them up ? 
B|10| M: no _i _don't_ take_ _any_ _of those_ [papers] . 
A|11| A: [uh-huh .] _we_ um _we_ [don't take] our _cans_ up _to_ _that_ center though our aluminum _cans_ _we_ like _to_ [take] them _to_ one [of] the _places_ where they pay _you_ for them . 
B|12| M: _right ._ 
A|13| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|14| M: _but_ [we] [do] [take] [cans] . 
A|15| A: [yeah] _it_ takes us _about_ _a_ year _to_ save up enough _to_ _be_ worth _you know_ worth bothering _to_ go _in_ _and_ [do] [but] . [do] _you_ um have [any] ideas on anything _that would_ make 
B|16| M: _well_ _i don't know_ . i've always i've never [uh] thought [about] getting involved [in] [any] type [of] [recycling] [uh] . 
A|17| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|18| M: [and] [uh] [and i] [know] [some] [places] will [take] [uh] newspaper [and] they'll also [take] [plastic] [bags] [and] [uh] [you know] . 
A|19| A: [right .] 
B|20| M: [and] [and _then] you_ [put] [it] [in] [your] regular trash . 
A|21| A: [yeah] _that would be_ _a_ _good_ idea . 
B|22| M: uh-uh _. i_ mean _i i think_ [i] [know] [that] [there] _are_ _a lot_ _more_ _people_ [that] use [plastic] . 
A|23| A: [yeah .] 
B|24| M: [and] [i'm] _not_ sure _how_ _you would_ [uh] _how_ you'd route getting [there] [and then] getting [it] [there .] 
A|25| A: [right .] [yeah] _that would be_ [a] real _good_ motivation for [people] . 
B|26| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: [right .] [yeah] my father was telling me [about] [some] program he read [about] where [you] buy [your] [bags] like [you] buy [your] garbage bag from the city 
B|28| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|29| A: [and] [you] pay [more] than just what [you would] pay for an empty garbage bag [but] [then you] [don't] pay [any] monthly fee or anything so [how] ever many [bags] [of] garbage [you] _throw_ _away_ _that's_ [how] many [you] have _to_ pay for . 
B|30| M: oh [that] sounds [good] . 
A|31| A: [yeah .] [yeah] _that would be_ [a] real [good] idea . [i'm] trying _to_ [think] if there's anything else [i] could [think] [of] . they [are] talking [about] going _to_ curbside pickup [in] our [in] our city . 
B|32| M: [uh] 
A|33| A: rowlett texas . 
B|34| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|35| A: [do] [you know] where [that] is ? 
B|36| M: [yeah .] 
A|37| A: [and [i] don't know] if they decided _to_ [do] or [not] [but] [i think] they said [it] was going _to_ add like either [a] dollar or three dollars [a] month _to_ [your] bill _to_ have them [do] [that] . although [i think] [a lot] [of those] programs can operate at [about] [a] break even break even point without charging [people] . 
B|38| M: [yeah .] [that's] true . 
A|39| A: [yeah] [i don't know] [uh] [i] guess [it] just depends on [how] they manage [it] . 
B|40| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|41| A: [i don't know] [how] much they get when they sell all [that] stuff . the center [that] they've got now where [you] [take] [your] stuff [in] [i i think] [that] should _be_ making [some] money . since they just have _to_ hire someone _to_ man [it] [a] few hours [a] week . 
B|42| M: _well _that's_ that_ [that would be] [good] . 
A|43| A: [and] they sell [i] guess they sell everything _to_ [some] waste company [that] comes [and] gets [it] . 
B|44| M: _well that's_ true . 
A|45| A: [but] [i] wish [that] [uh] [more] [of] the [cans] [you know] like the [cans] [you] buy vegetables [and] fruit [and] stuff like [that] [in] were recyclable [. [i] don't] [a lot] [of] [that's that] recyclable steel [and [i] don't know] anybody [that] takes [that] . 
B|46| M: [right .] 
A|47| A: my husband likes pepsi [and] [those] [cans] [are] steel instead [of] aluminum so [we] can't can't ever recycle them [. [i] think] it's [a] [good] reason _to_ quit buying [it] . 
B|48| M: [i don't] [think] [it] [would be] [any] better [because] [you] wouldn't [be] able [to] [throw] [it] [away] . 
A|49| A: [yeah] [that's] what [we] buy the most [of] unless we're going on [a] trip or something where [we] want [to] [put] the [cans] [in] [a] cooler 
B|50| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|51| A: [but] [well that's] all [i] can really [think] [about] for [recycling] . 
B|52| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|53| A: [it] was [good] talking [to] [you] . 
B|54| M: [you] too . 
A|55| A: [uh] bye . 
B|56| M: bye-bye .
