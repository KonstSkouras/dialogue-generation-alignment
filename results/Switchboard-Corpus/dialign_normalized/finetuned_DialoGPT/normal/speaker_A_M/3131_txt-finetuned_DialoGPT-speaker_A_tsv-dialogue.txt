B|28| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|29| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [so] as [a] [family] _you all_ just visited nursing homes or probably [in] college station there wasn't [a] whole _lot_ [of] choice .

A|45| A: adapt . 
B|46| M: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [yeah .] [i ,] as [i think] [i] mentioned [, i] [was] [in] [the] trust business [and] [i've] seen [so] many elderly people . usually there has [to be] some wealth involved , which is great , _if_ , _if_ you're financially , _if_ , _if you_ [don't] [make] [the] decisions [so] late [that] you're worried [about] money _but_ [the] , [the] places [like] presbyterian village [and] some [of the] , [the] retirement places [where] , [where] they [have] different levels [of] care seems [to be] [so] [much] _better_ , as far as elderly people adapting . 
B|48| M: uh-uh . [right] . 
A|49| A: [they're] [able to] move [in] while [they're] _still_ independent [and] _still_ social 
B|50| M: uh . 
A|51| A: _and , and_ they _do_ group [things] . [and] then _if_ health or , or mental capacity deteriorates [, they're] [able [to] take] [the] next steps without [so] [much] change [and] _oh [,_ i] wish everybody _could_ [go] [that] direction rather _than_ just _all_ [of] [a] sudden moving out [of the] [home] they've always been [in] . [it's] _really_ [kind of] difficult . 
B|52| M: [yeah .] 
A|53| A: [yeah .] 
B|54| M: _so [,_ i] mean , _we're_ [not] [all] [like] [that] . 
A|55| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|56| M: _because_ , uh . 
A|57| A: [well] _and it's_ [the] first step [in] , [in] actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing _and , and_ aging . 
B|58| M: [yeah .] [yeah] [, [and] ,] uh , _you know [,_ i think] , uh [i think] [that's] one [of the] [things] [that] we've come [a] long _way_ _, but_ [i [,] i] guess [it's] [still] , uh . 
A|59| A: [you know] once [you] [make that] step [you know] [that] [it's] just _going to be_ downhill from then [on] _and , and_ [i've] seen people _really_ fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to make] [the] change . 
B|60| M: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: they , they became , [in] fact , [that's] probably what's [going to happen] [with] my husband's mother . she's [going to] endanger herself before she'll willingly [and] probably will [never] willingly [make] [the] [decision] . [and] [that] scares me [the] , [the] thought [of] forcing somebody _to do_ something .

B|68| M: no . 
A|69| A: [yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and] [i think] [it] would [be] neat [if you] [could] [have] [a] reunion [with] [your] [family] . 
A|71| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [and , [and] ,] [you] , [you] get , [you] [want] them [to be] [able _to] , [to_ do] [their] job . 
A|73| A: [yeah .] [and] [the] quality [of] life _really_ _isn't_ there . 
B|74| M: no _, it_ [isn't] . 
A|75| A: _oh_ [it's] tough [, it] _really_ is . 
B|76| M: [i] [know] . 
A|77| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: [and ,] uh [, i think] [that's a] [really] important thing . 
A|79| A: [well ,] they fear being dependent [on] somebody . 
B|80| M: [oh ,] [yeah .] 
A|81| A: they , they fear being [a burden] [to , to] [family] members . 
B|82| M: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: my husband's mother will [have] major surgery [and] we'll find out [about] [it] [in] [a] casual conversation . she'll let something slip [and] we'll say , wait [a] minute . [and , and] [that's] [it] [, she ,] just , [well] [i] [didn't want to] bother [you [.] she] can't accept [that] _we_ [want to be] [the] care givers . 
B|84| M: [right] . 
A|85| A: [yeah .] [well [,] she] stayed [, she] stayed [in] [a] temporary nursing [home] . until [she was] okay . 
B|86| M: [oh] . 
A|87| A: [you know [,] it's] just [, but] [it's] frightening [to] us [because] _we_ live [pretty] far from [her] . she's down [in] temple 
B|88| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [and] _we_ can't see [her] often enough [to] [really] [know] what's [going] [on] . 
B|90| M: uh . 
A|91| A: [so [,] it's] difficult [, it] [really] is [and] [we're] [all] heading [that] [way] [and ,] 
B|92| M: [well [,] it] sounds [like] [you all] [are] doing [a lot] [better] [than] [we] [are] . 
A|93| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [so] [we're] [going to be] [in] arlington .
