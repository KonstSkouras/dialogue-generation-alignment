B|8| M: [right] . 
A|9| A: [yeah] _if_ _if_ _the_ person who's going _to_ commit _the_ _crime_ knew _that_ _they_ were going _to be_ punished severely possibly capital punishment 
B|10| M: [right] . 
A|11| A: _uh_ _i'm_ _a_ research engineer _i_ _work_ _uh_ _with_ georgia tech .

A|13| A: um . 
B|14| M: and [uh] . 
A|15| A: [yes] . 
B|16| M: and [uh] . 
A|17| A: um . 
B|18| M: and [uh _i] don't_ know _it's_ [it] just [i think] _it's_ [a] problem [that] we've got [to] address . 
A|19| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|20| M: _but_ _you_ know [i] _i don't_ _see_ [the] problem [with] [it .] 
A|21| A: um _that's_ probably _true_ _but i_ guess _there's_ other factors [that] 
B|22| M: [well i think] [the] [the] most significant factor _is_ [that] we're _not_ spending enough . 
A|23| A: [but] pumping _more_ _money_ into _the school_ system _is a good_ thing 
B|24| M: uh-uh [. right] . 
A|25| A: _but it's not_ going [to] [oh] [i] [see] . 
B|26| M: [it's not] just [the school] systems [i] mean [there's] been things done [to] try [to] [to] slow down [the] rate [of] [crime] and _i'm sure_ [that] [that] has [not] been 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: and [uh] [they] just [they] just seem [to] fit [right] [in] [with] [the] society and and _i don't_ know what [they] can do [to] fix [it .] 
A|29| A: um . 
B|30| M: and [uh] . 
A|31| A: so _that's a_ difficult _situation_ . 
B|32| M: uh-uh . uh-uh _yeah ._ 
A|33| A: um . 
B|34| M: and [i think] they're _a lot_ [more] hardened and they're they're [more] [uh] they've done [more] 
A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [but] [uh i] [i think] [that] [that] we're [in a] [in a] [situation] where we need [to] change [the] [way that] people [think] _about_ [it .] 
A|37| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|38| M: we're supposed [to [be] the] masters [of] [the] social [uh] 
A|39| A: _well that's_ probably _true ._ 
B|40| M: [yeah] [but] [uh] . 
A|41| A: um _yeah i_ guess _that's_ [not] an easy solution . [there's] [there's] _no_ easy solution _for_ _that ._ 
B|42| M: [no] . 
A|43| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|44| M: or _you_ could just hire people [that] are trained [to] do [that .] [i] mean [they] could _you_ know train them [to] do [it] [but] [uh] _you_ can't just hire them and then _you_ _you_ _have_ [to] train them . _you_ _have_ [to be] able [to] train [the] people [that] do [it .] 
A|45| A: [i'm sure] [it] [is] [yeah .] 
B|46| M: [but i] don t remember [if] [it's] [if it was] just [if] [they] gave him [a] scholarship [if] he'd [be] [in] [good] standing and _you_ know he'd get some [money] [for] [it] [but it's not] like [they] can just send him [to] anybody else . 
A|47| A: um _yeah [i_ don't] [i don't] certainly capital punishment isn't going [to] solve [a lot] [of] problems 
B|48| M: uh-uh . uh-uh [i think] [that] [uh] 
A|49| A: [but] 
B|50| M: [i don't] know . 
A|51| A: [uh] 
B|52| M: [uh] . 
A|53| A: [i] guess [i] am [for] certain 
B|54| M: [yeah .] 
A|55| A: [yeah] [in] certain crimes . 
B|56| M: [yeah [i] think] [that's] [true .] 
A|57| A: [uh] premeditated murder . crimes _of that_ nature [i think] should definitely

A|59| A: any mass murderer type individual . 
B|60| M: [uh] . 
A|61| A: um . [uh-huh .] [well] [you] always [have] castration 
B|62| M: [yeah i] know . 
A|63| A: [yes] [i] read [about] [that] 
B|64| M: [well that's] [that's a] [that] [that] [is a good] point . [i] hadn't thought [of [that] .] 
A|65| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: and [uh] [that's] what [they] said [in] [the] paper [they] said [that] [uh] [that] [the] [uh] [they] said [the] [the] [they] [uh] [the] civil [uh] rights program [uh] [that] [that] [the] judges [have] [to be] unanimous on [is] [not] [a good] [uh] ...
