A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [but [,] uh , i] [, i think] [that [,] that] we're [in a] _, [in_ a] [situation] where we need [to] change [the] [way that] people [think] _about_ [it .] 
A|37| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|38| M: we're supposed [to [be] the] masters [of] [the] social [, uh]

B|42| M: [no] . 
A|43| A: [uh-huh .]
