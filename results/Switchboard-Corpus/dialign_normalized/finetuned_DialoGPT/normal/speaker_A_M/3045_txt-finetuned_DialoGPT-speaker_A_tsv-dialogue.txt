A|45| A: _right ._ 
B|46| M: [and] _it's_ [really] [it] [really] [is] _. i mean_ _i've_ [i] can't remember [what] [the] name [of] _it is_ [but] _it's_ [like] [uh] _it was_ [like] [it] _had a_ hard-core type _of thing_ _you know_ [like] theakers [and] _all that_ . 
A|47| A: _yeah yeah ._ [that's] probably where you've [used _it] ._ 
B|48| M: _it's_ _it was_ [really] weird . 
A|49| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] [um] [i] [have] [that] [on] _my_ [uh] [computer] _here and_ also [um] _i do_ some work at u t d [and uh] [that's] [what] [they have] there [and] [it was] [just] [so] nice [to be] able [just] [to] step _into_ [the] position [and and] already [know] [the] [you know] already [know] _the the_ software . [and] [um] [i don't know] from _my_ own experience [um] wordperfect [is] [just] [so] [much] better than than wordstar at least [the] version [of] wordstar [that] [i] [used to] [have] . [it] may [be] improved by now [but] 
B|50| M: [uh] [yeah] _i mean_ _it's_ _i'm not_ _i _i_ think it's_ [been] _for a number of years_ _but um_ . 
A|51| A: [yeah] _it's uh_ wordstar [was] never very intuitive [to] [me [.] i mean] [you know] [you] some [of the] commands [just] [had] nothing [to do] with [you know] [what] [you] were supposed [to be] doing [what] [they] [what] [they] did [on] [the computer] [but uh] 
B|52| M: [right [.] _i] i_ [um] [. [i] do] [know] _a little_ bit _about_ [it _.] _i'm_ [i'm_ _a] computer_ scientist . 
A|53| A: [i mean] [like] [going] [um] forward [and] backward [a] word [or] up [and] _down_ [a] line [that] sort [of thing] [just] [you know] didn't match with [the] kinds [of] keys [you] were using . 
B|54| M: [uh] [yeah .] 
A|55| A: [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [and] _so [i_ mean] [i was] [like] [no] _i don't know _i_ just_ [go] ahead [and] type [it] _out_ you're [just] [like] okay i'll sit [down] [here and] _do _it_ you_ [don't] _have [to_ _do] [it_ .] 
A|57| A: [and] [but] wordperfect [is] [just] [a lot] [more] intuitive [in] [a lot of] ways . [and you] [and] [it] _does a lot of_ things _too_ [that] _if_ [you] _if_ [you] [do] _any_ [kind [of] uh] research [or] anything [like] [that] where _you [have_ [to] uh] [use] footnotes [it is] [just] wonderful . because [it] [keeps] track [of] [all] _your_ footnotes . 
B|58| M: [right .] 
A|59| A: [yeah] [and] _if_ [you] add [it] _if_ [you] put [a] footnote [in] [in] [the] middle _you know if_ [you] come up with some new piece [of] documentation [and you] put [that] [in] [the] middle [of] _your_ [paper] [and] [have to] footnote [it you] [just] change [um] [it] [just] automatically changes [all] _your_ footnoting numbers [for] [you] . 
B|60| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|61| A: [so] [you know] _it's just_ 
B|62| M:  !!! % !! ; !! remind [me] [of] [that] 
A|63| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] [and] [i think] [about] [how] [it used to be] _if_ [you] were doing [a] [paper] [and you] [had to] [go] _back_ [and] retype everything [and] [oh] [it was] [just] awful . [so um] [i don't know [i] think] [we] [have] [just] become [really] spoiled . [but] [i think [it's] a] nice [kind of] [way [to] be] spoiled 
B|64| M: [yeah] [i think] [so] [too] . 
A|65| A: [so um] [well i] [have] [not really] paid [much] attention because [i] clock although [i think] we've probably [been] talking at least ten minutes [so um] _if_ [you] [um] unless _you have_ some other things [you] want [to] talk [about] [as] having [to do] with p c 
B|66| M: [uh-huh .]

B|70| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|71| A: [oh] [sure] . 
B|72| M: [so] [uh] . 
A|73| A: [got] [a] problem huh ? [um]

B|76| M: [yeah] [the the] telephone . 
A|77| A: [but um] [i] [have] [um] _that that_ [was] [the] majority [of] _my_ writing although [um] [i] [have] also done [oh] free lance magazine writing [and] some educational writing . [and] [um] [for a] while [i] [had a] [um] [uh a] partnership with [a] [in] [an] advertising agency with another woman who [is a] [an] artist . [so i] did some advertising [and] p r [but] 
B|78| M: [oh] [really] ? 
A|79| A: [um] now [i'm] actually [i'm [i'm] not] working anymore [. [i'm] a] student [i'm a] graduate student [so] [i'm] doing [a lot of] writing [but uh] now [all] [of the] scholastic majors though 
B|80| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [i've] done [a little] [a lot of] different kinds [but] [i [i] just] [know] [right] now [that] [i] [couldn't] [have] put [out] half [of] [what] [i] did _if_ [that] [much] without [the] being [in] computers [so] [that's] [been] [really great .] [and [uh] _i'm] so_ [i'm] real spoiled . 
B|82| M: [yeah yeah .] 
A|83| A: [yeah .] 
B|84| M: [it's uh] 
A|85| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .]

A|87| A: good . 
B|88| M: [so] she's [learned] [how] [to do] _that and_ she's [got] [the] same level [of] interest [you know] [as] [i do] . 
A|89| A: [that's] [great .] 
B|90| M: [so] [uh] [i've] [got] two [little] kids [and uh] [they're] both [in] preschool .

B|94| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [so um] [i think] _that that would be_ [a] real [a] real [uh] advantage [to] _to her_ [to] [have] [that [and] uh] [do it] early 
B|96| M: [uh-huh .]

B|106| M: [that [that] that would be] that'd [be] [the] only [thing] [i] guess [that] [we] [would] [do] [to her] [is] [you know if] [we] [could] [just] [have] [her] [you know] [like] [your] grandmother [or] whatever . 
A|107| A: [well] nola [i] [have] enjoyed talking with [you] thoroughly . [this] [is] [really] [going [to] _be] fun_ [i think]
