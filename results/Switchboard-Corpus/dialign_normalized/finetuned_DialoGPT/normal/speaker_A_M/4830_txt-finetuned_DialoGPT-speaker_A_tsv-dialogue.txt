B|38| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|39| A: [yeah .]

B|60| M: [yeah] , [that's] true . 
A|61| A: [i mean ,] supposing [i] come [up] [to] [you] [and] [i] [just] point blank kill [you] .

B|64| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|65| A: [yeah .] 
B|66| M: [but i think] [, i think] [it's] important [that we] also examine [the] legal [system] [and] also [the criminal] side [of] [it ,] [to] see [how] [we] [can] improve [it .] 
A|67| A: [yeah .]
