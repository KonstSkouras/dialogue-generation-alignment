A|33| A: _and uh_ _i i think_ [they] should . 
B|34| M: [i] [do] [too] .

B|36| M: [right] [and] [it's] _not_ fair . 
A|37| A: [they] _they're_ caught dead [to] rights . [i i] [just] [think that] [that's] they've they've [taken] [a] life [and] [if they] should pay _for_ [it] with their life . 
B|38| M: _uh-huh ._ 
A|39| A: [yeah .]

A|49| A: oh [yeah .] [i [i] _i] don't_ agree with [that] _at_ all . 
B|50| M: [uh you [know] .] 
A|51| A: imagine [the] guilt [that] person would [have] . [i mean] burned [out] .
