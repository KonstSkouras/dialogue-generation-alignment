B|0| M: _yeah_ _i_ _have a_ dodge aries . 
A|1| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|2| M: _and so_ _uh _i_ don't know_ _i'm not_ real _sure_ _that_ _uh_ _that_ _that's_ _the_ way _to_ go _about_ selecting _a car_ _. i_ _think you_ _have_ _to _have_ a_ criteria _that you_ can follow _and uh_ . 
A|3| A: [i] see

A|5| A: top _of_ top _of_ [the] line . 
B|6| M: _right ._ 
A|7| A: _oh_ . 
B|8| M: _and then_ i'll get _in_ [the] _car_ _and_ lock [the] door _and_ try _not_ _to_ get _out_ [of] _it ._ 
A|9| A: _uh-huh ._ [right] [right .] 
B|10| M: _but_ _uh_ . 
A|11| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|12| M: _i mean_ they're _not_ _you_ _don't_ _have_ _to be_ conscious _of _them_ ._ _you know_ _it_ _it's_ _just_ _a_ _just_ _a_ part [of] being _you_ you're _not_ conscious [of] _it ._ 
A|13| A: _well i guess_ [i'm] [uh] more traditional [in] _that [i_ don't] _like_ power windows _or_ power locks _because_ [the] people _that i_ [know] who _have them_ always seem [to have] trouble with [them .] 
B|14| M: [uh] [uh] . 
A|15| A: [and uh] _so [i_ don't] [i] [just] [don't] _like_ anything _that i_ _can't_ figure [out] why [it] doesn't work 
B|16| M: uh-uh . uh-uh _yeah ._ 
A|17| A: [and then] [i] want [you know] good [uh] gas mileage _and i_ want an air bag _and uh _i_ guess_ 
B|18| M: _sure_ [uh-huh .] 
A|19| A: no [i] haven't . [have] [you] ? 
B|20| M: [i] _think_ [i] [have] . 
A|21| A: somehow [i] [just] [think [you] know] _i like_ [the] idea 
B|22| M: [well] _it's_ [it] _really_ is nice . 
A|23| A: [right .] 
B|24| M: _i mean you_ [you] [can't] deny [that] _but_ [you] can certainly 
A|25| A: [right] [that's] [a] good idea . 
B|26| M: [and uh _i] don't _know_ if_ _if_ they'd _really_ make [them] mandatory [i] [think] _it would_ _probably_ make _a _lot_ of_ sense [to [have] [them] .] 
A|27| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [so i] [i'm] [i] am _not_ _i don't _know_ if_ [i] _would_ go [that] far _but_ [uh] . 
A|29| A: _well i_ actually [i don't know] [a lot] [about] different brands [. i] tend [to have] [you know] _my_ requirements _like_ _the last_ time _i bought [a_ car] [i] _i guess_ _i did_ sort [of] prefer _american_ [and] _my_ requirements were basically [you know] good repair record good mileage [uh] _and i_ needed air-conditioning [and uh] [can't] remember _what_ _my_ _oh_ [i] wanted [uh] stick shift . [and [so] i] didn't [have a] whole [lot of] choice there _was_ one [car] [in] all [of] [the] [the] metropolitan area _that i_ could find [that [you] know] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with [a] stick shift [in] [it .] 
B|30| M: _yeah ._ 
A|31| A: [it] [it] turned [out] [to be] [a] [a] chrysler . [uh] lancer . 
B|32| M: [oh] _yeah ._ 
A|33| A: [yeah .] 
B|34| M: [yeah] _it's_ [uh] 
A|35| A: no [a] five speed . [and] [it] basically [it] _was_ _something_ [that] [a] military guy had ordered [and] hadn't picked up [and so] [it] had been on [the] [lot] three months [and] they were [really] eager [to] sell [it .] 
B|36| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [so _i] guess_ [in] this area at least [you _know] if _it's_ not_ automatic [it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [yeah .] [well] [that's] true . 
A|39| A: _well i_ [just] wanted [it] _because_ again [i] had _i guess_ traditionally always had [a car] [that] had one _and i_ thought [it would] [be] more reliable . 
B|40| M: [right .] 
A|41| A: [uh] 
B|42| M: [well i guess] [uh] [my] next [car] is going [to be] [american] [because] [i] [have a] honda [and i] [really] [like] [it .] 
A|43| A: [i] found [that] [out] [. [i] mean [you] know] [the] people [would] [just] sort [of] look at me [like] [you] must [be] crazy when [i] went [in] [to] [and] asked [and] [that] _was_ [a] requirement [so] 
B|44| M: [well] [that's] true . 
A|45| A: [so] 
B|46| M: [well] _i've_ _i'm not_ _sure_ [if] _i've talked to_ anybody else [in] [the] eighties [or] [not] _but_ _i've_ got [to] say [that i] [think] [the last] thing [i did] [to] [a car] [was] [i bought a] dodge caravan . 
A|47| A: [well] [i'm not] even [sure] all [of them] are anymore . at least [in] this area . 
B|48| M: [yeah] [i don't [know] if it's] [uh] is [it] [uh] 
A|49| A: [not] [that i] [was] looking for sports cars [but] now [the] people [i've talked to] [don't] seem [to have] stick shift . 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [and so] why _do_ [you] [like] stick shift ? 
B|52| M: [well] [it's not] [my] favorite [but] [it's] [something] [i] [do] enjoy doing . 
A|53| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and i] [have] [to] keep track [of] [what] [i'm] putting [in] [and] [what] [i] [what] [i] put [in] . 
A|55| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|56| M: [and [i] like] [it] where [it's] cold . 
A|57| A: [right] [and] actually [it's] [probably] safer on [you know] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [right .] 
A|59| A: [so]
