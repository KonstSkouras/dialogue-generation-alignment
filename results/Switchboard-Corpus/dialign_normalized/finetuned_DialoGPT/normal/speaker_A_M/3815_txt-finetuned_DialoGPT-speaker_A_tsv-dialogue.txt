B|22| M: [well ,] _it's_ _, it_ _really_ is nice . 
A|23| A: [right .] 
B|24| M: _i mean , you_ [, you] [can't] deny _that _,_ but_ [you] can certainly ,

B|26| M: [and , uh , _i] don't _know_ , if_ _, if_ they'd _really_ make [them] mandatory [, i] [think] _it would_ _probably_ make _a _lot_ of_ sense [to [have] [them] .] 
A|27| A: [uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: _so _, i_ _,_ [i'm_ [,] i] am _not_ [, _i] don't know_ _if_ [i] _would_ go [that] far _, but [,_ uh] . 
A|29| A: [well [,] i ,] actually [i don't know] [a lot] [about] different brands [. i] tend [to have] [, [you] know _,] my_ requirements _like_ _the last_ time _i bought [a_ car] [i [,] _i] guess_ _i did_ sort [of] prefer _american_ [and] _my_ requirements were basically [, [you] know ,] good repair record , good mileage [, uh ,] _and i_ needed air-conditioning [and , uh ,] [can't] remember _what_ _my_ , _oh [,_ i] wanted [uh ,] stick shift . [and ,] [so] [i] didn't [have a] whole [lot of] choice there _was_ one [car] [in] all [of] [the] , [the] metropolitan area _that i_ could find [that [,] [you] know ,] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with [a] stick shift [in] [it .] 
B|30| M: _yeah ._ 
A|31| A: [it [,] it] turned [out] [to be] [a ,] [a] chrysler . [uh] lancer . 
B|32| M: [oh ,] _yeah ._ 
A|33| A: [yeah .] 
B|34| M: [yeah] , _it's_ [, uh]

B|36| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [so , _i] guess_ [in] this area , at least [, [you] [know ,] _if] _it's_ not_ automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [yeah .] [well [,] that's] true . 
A|39| A: [well [,] i] [just] wanted [it] _because_ , again [, i] had [, _i] guess_ traditionally always had [a car] [that] had one _and i_ thought [it would] [be] more reliable . 
B|40| M: [right .] 
A|41| A: [uh ,] 
B|42| M: [well] [i guess [,] uh [,] my] next [car] is going [to be] [american] [because] [i] [have a] honda [and i] [really] [like] [it .] 
A|43| A: [i] found [that] [out] [. [i] mean , [you] know ,] [the] people [would] [just] sort [of] look at me [like] [, you] must [be] crazy when [i ,] went [in] [to] , [and] asked [and] [that] _was_ [a] requirement [so ,] 
B|44| M: [well [,] that's] true . 
A|45| A: [so ,] 
B|46| M: [well ,] _i've_ _, i'm not_ _sure_ [if] _i've talked to_ anybody else [in] [the] eighties [or] [not] _, but_ _i've_ got [to] say [that i] [think] [the last] thing [i did] [to] [a car] [was] [i bought a] dodge caravan . 
A|47| A: [well [,] i'm not] even [sure] all [of them] are anymore . at least [in] this area . 
B|48| M: [yeah] [, [i] don't know] [if it's] [, uh ,] is [it [,] uh] 
A|49| A: [not] [that i] [was] looking for sports cars [, but ,] now [the] people [i've talked to] [don't] seem [to have] stick shift . 
B|50| M: [yeah .] 
A|51| A: [and so] why _do_ [you] [like] stick shift ? 
B|52| M: [well ,] [it's not] [my] favorite [but] [it's] [something] [i] [do] enjoy doing . 
A|53| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and i] [have] [to] keep track [of] [what] [i'm] putting [in] [and] [what] [i ,] [what] [i] put [in] . 
A|55| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|56| M: [and [i] like] [it] where [it's] cold . 
A|57| A: [right] , [and] actually [it's] [probably] safer on [, [you] know ,] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [right .]
