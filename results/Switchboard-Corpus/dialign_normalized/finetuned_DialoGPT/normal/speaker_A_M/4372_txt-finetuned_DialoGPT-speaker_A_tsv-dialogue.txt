A|2| A: [i] i'll agree [it] [it's] [not] your responsibility _but_ is [it] [also] legal for _you_ [to] do [that] ? from what [i] understand from various net readings [it] [the] federal government is going [to] try [to] legislate a more aggressive enforcement [of] state tax schemes [uh] [in] into place [in the] next few years . [it] is [it] is a lost revenue stream _right_ now [and] states can use all [the] revenue _they_ can get . with some with something like [that] do your arguments still apply ?
