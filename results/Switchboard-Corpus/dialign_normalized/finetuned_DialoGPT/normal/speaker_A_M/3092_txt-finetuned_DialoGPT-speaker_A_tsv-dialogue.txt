A|91| A: [yes] [, that's] true . orthodontic [work] [is] terribly [expensive] . 
B|92| M: [and , uh [,] so] [i] don't [know [,] i [,] i'm] [, i guess] [i'm] biased [because] [i'm] [a] [, a] medical doctor [and so] i've seen some [things [that] are] [just] [, you know ,] over priced , over thought ,

B|96| M: [oh .] 
A|97| A: [and] [we] footed [the] bill , [because] [there] _was not_ any such thing [and] [when] [they] were young . 
B|98| M: [right .] 
A|99| A: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|100| M: [so] [he] needed [a] dentist [to] pull him _up_ [. and] [the] orthodony [was not] good . [he] needed [a] [, uh] [a] private orthopedist [to] pull [the] [dental] away [from] him . 
A|101| A: [uh-huh] , major . 
B|102| M: [and , uh] . 
A|103| A: [uh-huh .]

A|105| A: [well , i] tell [you] [i [,] i] [just] read an article [in the] paper [about] what [they] [are doing] [, i think] [it] [was] an ad [in] [, in] our publication at texas instruments , where [they] [are] breaking [the] jaw [and , and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with] [the] teeth . 
B|106| M: [oh ,] [really] . 
A|107| A: [it's ,] [it's] less painful [and] less [expensive] . 
B|108| M: uh-oh [, that's] good . 
A|109| A: [yeah .] 
B|110| M: [well [,] that's] good . 
A|111| A: [i [,] i] [know [,] but] [it ,] [it's ,] [it's [,] uh ,] easier on [the] patient [in the] long run , which amazed me .
