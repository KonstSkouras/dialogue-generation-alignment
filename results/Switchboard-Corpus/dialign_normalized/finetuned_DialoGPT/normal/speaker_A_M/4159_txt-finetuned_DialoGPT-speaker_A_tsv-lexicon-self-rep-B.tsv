3	3	, uh ,	35	M	10, 34, 44
3	3	, uh .	43	M	2, 20, 44
3	3	, you can't	23	M	0, 10, 22
3	3	going to be	35	M	10, 18, 44
3	3	i , i	35	M	10, 18, 44
2	3	, you have	11	M	0, 10
2	3	a , a	11	M	16, 26
2	3	not , you	23	M	0, 22
2	3	the process of	3	M	26, 28
2	3	they have to	21	M	12, 32
2	3	to do it	25	M	10, 34
2	3	whether or not	11	M	2, 12
2	3	you can't just	35	M	10, 44
2	3	you're going to	25	M	10, 34
7	2	i think	41	M	4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 44

4	2	uh ,	35	M	10, 28, 34, 44
3	2	, it's	41	M	4, 18, 44
3	2	, that's	25	M	10, 12, 34
3	2	a ,	17	M	10, 16, 26
3	2	i don't	5	M	14, 16, 18
3	2	it's ,	43	M	2, 4, 44
3	2	not ,	23	M	0, 18, 22
3	2	they have	29	M	12, 32, 40
3	2	think it's	29	M	16, 18, 44
3	2	to be	35	M	10, 18, 44

2	2	, that	19	M	12, 30
2	2	, the	15	M	30, 44
2	2	, they	13	M	28, 40
2	2	, you're	11	M	0, 10
2	2	. i	5	M	10, 14
2	2	and then	9	M	2, 10
2	2	based on	9	M	0, 8
2	2	but i	3	M	14, 16
2	2	it's not	5	M	18, 22
2	2	know ,	3	M	12, 14
2	2	people .	31	M	0, 30
2	2	problem .	41	M	4, 44
2	2	right .	13	M	24, 36
2	2	should be	3	M	8, 10
2	2	that ,	13	M	0, 12
2	2	that .	17	M	22, 38
2	2	that's ,	3	M	10, 12
2	2	that's a	29	M	10, 38
2	2	they ,	5	M	28, 32
2	2	way of	31	M	10, 40
2	2	you have	11	M	0, 10
10	1	that	43	M	0, 8, 10, 12, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 42
10	1	the	43	M	2, 8, 10, 12, 26, 28, 30, 34, 40, 44
