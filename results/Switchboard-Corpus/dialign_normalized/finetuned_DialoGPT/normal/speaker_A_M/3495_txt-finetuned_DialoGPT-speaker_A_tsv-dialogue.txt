B|17| M: [right] . 
A|18| A: _uh_ [i] 
B|19| M:  !!! % !! remind me [of that .] 
A|20| A: _the_ economy _is_ lousy 
B|21| M: _yeah_ [and] [and] [i don't know] 
A|22| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|23| M: [and uh] _they've_ _they [have_ [a] a] real [uh] _they have_ real [problem] _with_ [uh] _with_ hispanics . 
A|24| A: boy _that really_ _that really_ takes someone who _is_ bold _to_ do [that .] 
B|25| M: [it] [really] does . 
A|26| A: _well_ now do [you] find [that] security _is_ _very_ good _in_ _in a_ _in a_ town _home_ ? 
B|27| M: [well] [not] [really] [. uh] there's some [there] [are] some [really] _nice_ ones [. uh] _we [have_ [a] a] [uh] _uh a_ [very] _nice_ _one_ [. uh] [it's] just [a] [it] [it] [has] [a] basement [and] [it's] [the] only _thing [that_ really] bothers me _. the_ rest [of] [it] [is] [pretty] _nice_ [. uh] . 
A|28| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|29| M: [and] [it's not] always _the the_ [people] [that are] [at] [home] [are] [the] ones [that are] buying [the] [most] . 
A|30| A: [well] [that] 
B|31| M: [so] [it's] [it] [is a] real [problem] . 
A|32| A: _i see ._ 
B|33| M: [and uh] [so] [i] [was] _kind of_ thinking [well] [you know] [we're] going [to] [have a] reunion [in _a] couple of_ years [and] [i] [really] [like] [that] 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| M: [so] [i] mean [i don't] [i] just [i think] [i'm] getting old [and] [i] don 't [like] [it] when kids [are] involved [in] _things_ [like] [that .] 
A|36| A: [well] [i think] [you] hit on [one] point [there] [is] [you know] each other . 
B|37| M: [yeah] [well] [it's] [it] [it seems like] [it's] [pretty] steady . [i don't know] [you you] need _to keep up with_ [a lot of] _things_ [i guess] . 
A|38| A: [i'm] [i'm] [in a] neighborhood where [we] try [to keep up with] everything [. uh] [i] am _oh_ about three blocks off [a] major road [and [uh] [a] couple of] blocks off another road [that] [kind of] runs [i guess] [you] would say [the] neighborhood road [it] runs between [the] high school [and] [the the] commercial districts [and uh] [i'm] over [the] northeast part [of] dallas . [it's] [a] [in a] [nice] neighborhood [. the] houses here [uh] before [the] recession were running two hundred thousand or [so] [and] course everything's down ten [to] twenty percent now . 
B|39| M: [oh] [i see .] 
A|40| A: but [we have] [uh] [one] [one] [thing that] effects us [is] [we have] apartments [that are] probably about [a] half mile away [and] now [the] economy [is] bad [they have] trouble keeping those full [so] [they've] dropped [the] [uh] they're [not] nearly as selective as [they] used [to] be . 
B|41| M: [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [and] course that's [kind of] [like] [a] cancer [in] an apartment complex . [you] start letting [that] happen [and] [they] go down [and] then before [you know] [it] [you] [have] drugs [and] [a lot of] other [things] [so] [uh] [i'm] sure [that] aggravates [it] also . 
B|43| M: [right] . 
A|44| A: but unemployment now [in] dallas or [in] texas [is] [up] around six point
