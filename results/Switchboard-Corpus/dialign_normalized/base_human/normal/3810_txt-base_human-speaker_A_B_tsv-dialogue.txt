A|12| A: [uh] _my_ husband [and] _my_ other son _who's_ eleven [just] _got_ _through_ singing [in] [a] musical here [in] [in the] [community] _at_ [music] man .

B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: [and] [so] [they] went [and] tried [out] [and] _my_ husband played harold hill _from_ [the] [music] man [and] _my_ son played [one] [of the] children [in] [a] band . 
B|19| B: _oh_ _how_ [fun .]

B|21| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: _but uh_ [we] [just] [really] _like_ [music] [. it's] [a] [i] [i] especially _like_ _it_ _as_ _an_ outlet _when_ [the] t v goes off [we] [get] [the] t v off [and] [just] [have] _some_ _nice_ quiet [music] . 
B|23| B: _um_ [uh-huh] _um ._ [yeah] [yeah] [that's] [nice] _. you_ say [have] [your] [four year old] taking [lessons] already ? 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [and uh] [who] _do_ [you] _have her_ _or_ _him take_ [it] [from] ? 
A|26| A: _uh _i_ have_ [him take] _from a_ friend [of] mine [who] teaches _suzuki_ . which _is_ _an_ auditory type learning experience . 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [you] listen [to] [the] [music] [and] then learn _to play_ [it] by by hearing [the] intervals [and] things _like_ [that] . 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [i] teach [uh] _like_ _what_ _is_ traditionally taught [you know] [you] look _at the_ note on [the] page [and] [you] _play_ what's on [the] _piano_ _but_ he can't learn _like_ [that] . he's [a] delayed child . he's only _about_ [i] guess he's _about_ two _and a half_ [in] his [real] understanding [of] things . 
B|31| B: _oh_ . 
A|32| A: [and _uh] so_ _when_ _my_ friend played _something_ on [the] _piano_ [and] he played [it] [uh] _with_ his right hand [we] went wow 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [we] better [have] [him] [do] [do] _something_ [. [you] know] educationally . 
B|35| B: [yeah] . [yeah] . 
A|36| A: [so] [that] _was_ [really] [fun .]

A|38| A: [my] husband [and] [i] love [to] go [to] [the] musicals downtown though . 
B|39| B: pardon [me] ? 
A|40| A: [so] [my] husband [and] [i] love [to] go [to] [the] musicals _when they_ _come_ into town into dallas . 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] _well_ [i have] [an] eight [and a half] [year old] [daughter] [who's] taking [piano lessons] [and] [started] [out] [at the] age [of] [just] turning five 
A|42| A: [um .] 
B|43| B: [because] _she_ wanted [you know] _she_ [just] seemed [to] enjoy [it] [so] much [and] now [my] [my] [four year old] [four] [and a half] [year old] [daughter] _is is_ trying [to] imitate _her_ older sister [and] wanting [to play] [and] _she_ actually [does] [some] _very_ [nice] chording [just] naturally . _she_ [just] 
A|44| A: [oh] _i think_ [that's] great . 
B|45| B: [so] [i] wasn't _sure_ [when] [to] _start_ _her_ . [i] didn't _want to_ push _her_ [too] early either [but uh] [kind of] had [a] mixed feelings [about] [that] scene . 
A|46| A: [that's] [really] hard _i think_ [because] especially _if_ [you] [start] [them] [and] then [they get] pretty _good_ [and] then [they get] close ten [you know] eleven [or] _something_ [they] go _i don't_ [want to] [do] _this_ anymore [and] you're _like_ god [i] [really] [want] [you] [to] [do] _it ._ 
B|47| B: [uh-huh] [yeah] . 
A|48| A: [you know] . 
B|49| B: [yeah] . 
A|50| A: [so] sometimes [it's] hard [to] [to] [know] exactly [when] [but] _i don't know _if_ she_ acts _like_ [she] wants [to] [or] says [she] wants [to] maybe [you] could [have her] [take] [some] _for_ [a] while [and] see [how] [she] likes _it ._ 
B|51| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] [yeah] [i think] she'd [like] [to] [i] [just] [don't know if] [it's] [really] knowing [from] [what] [my daughter] [has] gone [through] she's [she] learned _a lot_ [and] [of] course [it was] [something] [she] had [to] keep relearning [if she] ever [got] away [from] [it .] 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [it was] [something] easily forgotten . [so] [uh [i] don't know if] she's _any_ farther ahead than those kids [who] [started] [when they] [were] eight [or] [or] should [i] say seven . [i] mean she's not [a] gifted pianist [in the] sense [that] she's going [to] excel [just] naturally . [she] [does] [have] [to] [really] work [at] [it] [but [uh] so] 
A|54| A: [that's] [like] [me] . 
B|55| B: [yeah] [but] [so] i'm [kind of] [you know] [just] playing [with] [it] [but] [at] [this] point we're going [to] [kind of] wait [i think] [just] more [for] [the] financial reasons [of] [it] anyway [but] 
A|56| A: [well] [it] can [get] expensive 
B|57| B: [yeah] . 
A|58| A: [that's] [for] [sure] . 
B|59| B: [yeah] . 
A|60| A: [i] [my] friend [is is] [very] generous [in] [in] letting us [have] [my] children [uh] [do] [the] _suzuki method_ without paying [a lot] [out] . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] [oh] [that's] [good] . 
A|62| A: [yeah] [so] [it's been] [good] [for] our family . 
B|63| B: [well] [as] [a] [piano] teacher [do] [you] _have any_ feelings [for] kids [who] [come] [from a] [suzuki method] [have] [you] had _any_ former _suzuki students_ ? 
A|64| A: [i don't] [have any] [suzuki students] [. uh] 
B|65| B: [i] [was] wondering [how]
