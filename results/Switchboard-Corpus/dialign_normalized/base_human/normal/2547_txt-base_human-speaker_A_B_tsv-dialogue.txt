B|3| B: _yeah_ _i_ work _here_ _in_ germantown _but_ _i_ _live in_ pensacola florida . 
A|4| A: _oh that's_ interesting . 
B|5| B: _so i_ own _a _home_ in_ pensacola _and uh_ let's see _we_ _are_ _to_ compare homes . correct ? 
A|6| A: okay _. _yeah_ ._ 
B|7| B: [uh] _my_ [home] [is] _well_ [is] _typical for the area ._ _i_ _live in_ _a_ development _uh _it's_ a_ relatively _i_ _would_ _say_ _well_ god _it sounds like_ _sounds like_ i'm bragging 
A|8| A: _no_ _that's_ okay 
B|9| B: _but_ _it's_ upper middle class [uh] _kind of_ an environment . 
A|10| A: okay . 
B|11| B: _it's a_ _two_ story colonial which _my_ wife [and] _i_ _designed_ . 
A|12| A: _oh that's_ neat . 
B|13| B: [uh] _it has_ _around_ thirty-two _hundred square feet_ . [uh] five _bedrooms and_ _so_ forth [and] _so_ _on_ 
A|14| A: wow _that's_ large 
B|15| B: [and] _it is_ _i_ _would_ imagine _in_ terms _of of_ size [and] _so_ forth _it's_ relatively _typical for the area ._ _it_ might _be_ _i_ _would_ _say_ _it's_ _probably_ midsized _for the area ._ _there_ _are_ some smaller [and] _there_ _are _you_ know_ several larger . 
A|16| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _and uh_ _but_ based _you know_ _in_ terms _of_ _you know_ _in_ _in_ pensacola _in_ [that] _area_ _of_ florida _it_ _uh it's_ [what] _now_ _it is_ [uh] _probably_ ten _years old_ . 
A|18| A: _oh_ _well _that's_ not_ too bad 
B|19| B: [yeah .] 
A|20| A: _that's_ _still_ fairly _new_ . 
B|21| B: [and] _so_ _it's_ _in_ terms _of_ cost _and _and_ and_ size [and] _so_ forth _it_ _uh the_ _you know_ _housing_ _there_ [is] extremely affordable _and uh_ compared _to_ other parts _of the_ country _you know_ let's _say_ compared _to_ maryland [that] _same_ _house_ _here would_ _probably_ cost three-quarters _of a_ million dollars 
A|22| A: [well] 
B|23| B: _but_ 
A|24| A: _oh_ you're kidding [well] _do_ [you] mind _if i_ ask [what] [it's] worth down [there] _i mean_ [what] [it's] 
B|25| B: [i] _really_ haven't [i] _really_ haven't [uh] _when_ _we_ _built_ _it_ ten _years_ ago _it _was_ it_ ran _around_ _a hundred and_ _forty thousand_ dollars . 
A|26| A: okay . 
B|27| B: _so i i_ _would_ _have_ _really_ [i] haven't _really_ priced _you know_ _in the_ market _so i_ 
A|28| A: [it] [it sounds like] _i mean_ _from the_ way _you described_ [it] [a home] [like] [that] [here _would] be_ [at] least [two] [hundred and] _fifty thousand_ 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: _i mean_ _dallas_ _is _a_ very_ marked up [area] although _right now_ [it's _a] lot_ _lower_ um _because of_ all [the] layoffs [and] everything 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [the] economy _around here is_ _real_ poor 
B|33| B: [i] thought [that] _was_ _on_ [the] upswing again [now] . 
A|34| A: [well] _no_ _not_ [really] 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: um [the area] itself [uh the] fort worth _dallas_ [area] um [has] become [kind of] depressed _because_ there's _been_ [so] many layoffs _with_ big companies including texas instruments 
B|37| B: yes . 
A|38| A: um there's _been_ tremendous amounts [of of] [uh] layoffs [so] [really] [housing] [is] _real_ bad . [the] economy itself _around here _is_ not_ too terribly bad [but] [housing] [is] _still_ _real_ bad 
B|39| B: [uh-huh] 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [well] pensacola [has] [it's] [really] [is a] buyer's market [there] [now] 
A|42| A: [yeah .] _this is_ 
B|43| B: [and] [it] isn't [because _of] the_ [well] [there] [has] [been] _a lot of_ speculative building . [uh] _i don't know_ perhaps [not] _in_ [dallas] 
A|44| A: _oh_ . 
B|45| B: [but] [uh] i'm _sure_ people _in_ [uh] _you know_ _in_ [uh] galveston [and] [so] forth [would be] knowledgeable [about] [it] [uh] pensacola [is a] navy town . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] [home] porting _was_ [a] possibility [a] few _years_ ago . 
A|48| A: _oh_ . 
B|49| B: _they_ _were_ expecting an influx [of] _something_ _on_ [the] order [of] [fifty thousand] people _or_ _more_ [from the] navy 
A|50| A: wow . 
B|51| B: [a] [new] carrier _was_ coming _in_ _and [uh_ the] [uh] attendant [uh] support vessels . [well that's] [no] longer [the] case . 
A|52| A: [so] _do_ [you] _think_ [it was] overdeveloped then ? 
B|53| B: [oh] [it's] _it is_ . [i mean] [the] [the] number [of] single family units _on_ sale [is] phenomenal compared _to_ [the] population . 
A|54| A: wow . 
B|55| B: [and] [so] overbuilding [is] [has] [been] [a] [real] problem [there] . 
A|56| A: um . 
B|57| B: [so] [you] can [still] get [a] get [a] [a] good _house_ _for [a_ very] [very] reasonable price . [and] [i mean] good [i] [would] let's _say_ _typical_ _say_ _three_ _bedroom_ [uh] [two] [and] [a] half baths _on_ [a] half acre _or_ [so] [of] land [uh] reasonable construction [would] _probably_ run [you] [uh] [right now] anywhere between somewhere between _a hundred and_ _a hundred and_ _forty thousand_ dollars . [and] _probably_ perhaps cheaper depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
A|58| A: um [yeah _.] [yeah_ .] 
B|59| B: [what] [about your home] ? 
A|60| A: [well] [right now] we're _just_ renting [but] [it [is] [a] home] . um 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [it's a] _four_ [bedroom] [home] [it has] [about] _i guess_ eighteen [hundred square feet] [it's] [on] _one_ floor 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [uh] [we] [have] [no] basement [i don't know] 
B|65| B: nor [do] [we] [but] 
A|66| A: okay [i] wasn't [sure] . _most_ [of the] ones [you know] up _north_ [and] everything [do] [but] um anyway _it's [uh_ it's] pretty also pretty [typical for the area .] _most_ [of] _this_ [area] [was] developed _this_ [house] [was] [built] [in] seventy-four . 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [so] _most_ [of the] [it's] _almost_ _twenty_ [years old] [and] _most_ [of the] houses _around here_ [were] [built] pretty _much_ _the same_ style [uh] [we] [have] [a] friend [that] lives [two] blocks _over_ [and] his [house] [is] _almost_ identical [to] us except his [is] [three] [bedrooms and] ours [is] _four_ 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty _much_ _the same_ . [so _i i] think_ _most_ [of] them [are] [there] [was it] [like] _most_ _areas_ [that] [are] [built] um [there] [were] [probably] [like] [two] [or] [three] styles [you] could choose [from] 
B|71| B: _right ._ 
A|72| A: [and [and] uh] [that's] pretty _much_ all [the] houses [in [the] area] [for] [probably] [a] [square] mile i'd [say] [at] least _maybe_ even _a little bit_ [more] _than that_ . 
B|73| B: [well] [the] [housing] [here] [in] maryland [is] [just] atrocious . [and] [in] [in the] entire d c [area .] i'm i'm _only_ [about] [uh] twelve miles [or] [so] [from the] [uh] border [of] washington d c [and] montgomery county maryland [is] [probably] [one] [of the] [most] expensive places [to] 
A|74| A: _where_ [are you] [in] relation [to] _sevren_ ? [are you] close [to] _sevren_ ? 
B|75| B: [no] [we] [are] west . 
A|76| A: okay . 
B|77| B: [sevren] [is] east near [the] eastern shore 
A|78| A: [well] [i] [just] 
B|79| B: [if i] _had_ 
A|80| A: [i] [have] [a] sister [that] used [to] [live in] [sevren] . 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [and] [they] bought _their_ [home in] [i i] want [to] [say] [like] [around] nineteen seventy-five [or] [something] [like] [that] [and] [they] paid [like] [they] [they] [had] [it] [built] [from] [you know] [they] [they] [designed] [it] [and] everything [and] [to] [have] [it] [built] [they] [only] paid [forty thousand] [for] [it] [and] [when] [they] left [the area] [they] sold [it] [for [a] hundred and] _twenty_ [thousand] 
B|83| B: [oh [that's] not] unusual [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [yeah] [so i] [just] wondered [you know] [if] [the] whole [area] [was] [like] [that] [or] 
B|85| B: [well that's] [that] [area] [over] [there] [is not] as expensive as [in the] [the] immediate [you know] washington [area .] 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [and] [so] [we] [uh] [i] [was] [just] looking [for] example [there] [is a] [uh] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex [where] [i] [live] [and] [i] [was] [over] [there] recently looking [at] [the] possibility [of] buying [a] [two] [bedroom] condominium . [and] ninety-two [thousand] dollars [for a] [two] [bedroom] which [is] essentially [a] [two] [bedroom] apartment . 
A|88| A: um . 
B|89| B: [now] [it was] [very] nicely done . 
A|90| A: [yeah .] 
B|91| B: [i] [would] [have] thought 
A|92| A: [sounds like] [a lot of] _money_ though 
B|93| B: yes . [i i] can't [i] can't envision spending _that much_ [money] [and] [on] [on] [something] along those lines . 
A|94| A: [sure] _. [yeah_ .] 
B|95| B: [so] [you know] [it's] [i guess] [you] pay [the] piper [but] plus [the] [the] [the] taxes [around here] [are] phenomenally high . 
A|96| A: [right .] [oh] [yeah .] 
B|97| B: [uh] [for the] [and] [so] [you] [on] [that] [it's] [not] unusual [for] example [for] somewhere [around here] [on] [a] [on] [a] [on] [a] [what] [we] [would] [you know] [what] [you described] as [your] [house] [and] [what] [i] [would] describe as _my_ [house] [say] [for] example [in] pensacola florida [on] [that] [house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] [so] forth [and] [so] [on] might pay [three] [or] [four] [hundred] dollars [a] year taxes . [maybe] [you know] [maybe] [a little bit] higher [than that] [now] 
A|98| A: wow _. [yeah_ .] 
B|99| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] [here] you'd pay [almost] six [thousand] dollars [a] year taxes [on] [it] . 
A|100| A: wow wow [that's] 
B|101| B: [so] [it's uh] [so] [the] question [of] whether [to] buy [here] [or] move [to] another county [say] drive [twenty] [more] miles [north] buy [a] condominium [for] approximately [uh [the] same] price [maybe] [a little] [lower] [but] [the] taxes [would be] [you know] perhaps [maybe] one-third [uh] [of] 
A|102| A: [really] ? [that much] [of a] difference ? 
B|103| B: [oh] absolutely [. yeah] 
A|104| A: wow . 
B|105| B: [so] [it's] [it's] [really] sad 
A|106| A: [yeah] 
B|107| B: [this is] [one] [this is] [one] [of the] [most] highly taxed [areas] [in the] country . 
A|108| A: wow . why [is] [that] ? [do] [you know] ? [i mean] 
B|109| B: [well] [they] [it] [the] [their] [they] [do] [have] an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems [for] example . [it has] [one] [of the] best school systems [in the] country . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh] 
B|111| B: [uh] [and] [because] [the] cost [of] living [around here is] [so] high 
A|112| A: [oh] . 
B|113| B: public employees make great salaries [around here] 
A|114| A: [oh] 
B|115| B: [i] [was] reading [just] recently [where] [the] [typical] administrator [in the] montgomery county public schools makes [and] i'm [not] [this is] [uh the] figure he makes eighty [thousand] dollars [a] year . 
A|116| A: [my] goodness 
B|117| B: [that's] 
A|118| A: wow 
B|119| B: [and] [i] by administrator [i i think] [i mean] [i] [they] didn't [they] did [not] define [it] [but] [for] example [a] curriculum supervisor [or] principal [or] someone [you know] [in] [that] [uh] [in] [that] range .
