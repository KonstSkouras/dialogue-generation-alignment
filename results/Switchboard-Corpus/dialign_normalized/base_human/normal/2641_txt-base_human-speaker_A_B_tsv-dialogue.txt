A|2| A: _um_ _we got_ _two cats ._ 
B|3| B: [two cats .] 
A|4| A: _yeah and_ _uh_ _um yeah _we_ had_ _cat_ _you know_ _my_ family _had_ [cats] _when_ _we_ _were_ growing _up_ _the whole_ _time_ until _my_ mom developed _an_ _allergies_ 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _so _i_ mean_ _i'm_ _used_ _i'm_ _used to_ _having cats around_ _i like_ _them ._ 
B|7| B: _yeah [i_ like] [having cats around] _or_ pets [around] _in_ general _i i_ favor _dogs_ over [cats] actually _but_ 
A|8| A: _oh_ _see_ _i'm_ _not_ _uh_ _i'm_ _not _a dog_ person_ _at_ _all_ 
B|9| B: [oh] [i'm] [i'm] [a dog person] _. _i_ had_ _i guess_ _it_ depends _on_ _what_ [you] [had] [when] _he_ [were] _a kid_ _right_ ? 
A|10| A: [yeah] probably _i _was_ allergic to_ [dogs] _when i was a kid_ [in] fact 
B|11| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: [i] may still _be_ _um_ _we_ 
B|13| B: _but_ [not] [cats .] 
A|14| A: _that_ _um i_ wonder _sometimes_ 
B|15| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _um_ [but] _we_ _um_ _we_ _house_ sat _for _a_ um_ _my_ _um_ _my_ wife's boss [a] couple weeks _ago_ _and um_ _uh_ [he] _has_ [a dog] _and_ everything _we_ [were] _you know_ _we_ [were] sitting _the dog_ _and_ everything _and_ _uh_ [i] felt [like] _just_ miserable _all_ _weekend _and_ it_ _really_ _didn't_ dawn _on me_ until sunday _it was_ [like] hey _maybe_ you're still _allergic _to_ _the_ dog_ _. it was_ [like] _oh that_ _could_ _be_ _it ._ 
B|17| B: [the] _thing_ _i don't_ [like] _about_ [dogs] [sometimes] _is_ [that] [the] [house] _will_ [just] reek _of_ [the] [dogs] [and] constantly . 
A|18| A: _yeah ._ _well_ [dogs] _are_ real high maintenances [you] _got_ _to take_ _them_ _for_ walks [and] you've _got_ _to_ pay _a lot_ _you know_ [you] need _to_ pay _attention_ _to_ _cats and_ everything _but it's not_ quite [the] same _thing ._ 
B|19| B: [yeah] _that's_ true . 
A|20| A: _um_ _and um_ _um_ _you know_ _it's_ _it's_ [just] nice [that] _cats you know_ [cats] _yeah you_ _don't have_ _to_ let _them_ outside _you know_ _all_ _cats are_ indoor [cats] 
B|21| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|22| A: _so _you know_ _they're_ not_ you're [not] worried [about] _them_ running all-around [the] neighborhood _and you know they_ _you know they_ _they_ _make_ _their_ mess _in the_ _cat_ _pan_ _which_ [is] 
B|23| B: limited . 
A|24| A: [yeah] _it's_ _you know_ _it's_ [a] pain _to_ _clean_ [but] _you know_ _we used to_ _i mean_ _they_ _got_ great stuff _out_ _now_ _for_ cleaning cats' pans . _they_ _didn't_ 
B|25| B: [oh] [really] ? 
A|26| A: _well_ _when i _was_ you know_ _when i was_ growing _up_ _i had a_ _clean_ [the] _cat_ _pan_ _all the_ _time_ _and i_ hated [it] _because [i_ had] _to_ carry everything upstairs _and you know_ [and] use _this_ _thing to_ _you know_ scoop [the] _take the_ stuff _out_ [and] _put_ [it] _in the_ toilet [and] everything _it was_ [really] terrible _. but_ _now_ _they have_ [like] _this_ [you] _get_ _these_ liners [that] [is] _garbage_ _bags_ _you know_ 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: _and you_ _and you_ _you know_ [the] 
B|29| B: [oh that] sounds [so] easy _what i_ did 
A|30| A: [yeah] _the cats_ _do it_ _in there_ [you] pull [it] [and] _take_ [it] _out_ [and] throw [it] _away_ [and] [that's] [it] 
B|31| B: _yeah i_ housesat _from_ [cats] [for _a] friend of mine_ [which] _she was_ finishing [up] _her_ thesis 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: [and] _what_ [we used to] [do] [was] [just] [put] [um] newspaper _on the_ bottom [and] then [put] [cat] litter [and] then [i] would [just] [take [the] whole] [thing [to] the] [garbage] _can_ [and] dump [the whole] [thing .] 
A|34| A: same _idea_ 
B|35| B: then [i] would [do it] [you know] _everyday_ _or_ [two] days [so i] would [clean] [that] [pan] very very rarely 
A|36| A: [everyday] ? 
B|37| B: [and] [so] [it] _wasn't_ [so] _bad_ . 
A|38| A: [oh] okay [i] _see_ . 
B|39| B: [two [cats] and] [just] _as_ easy [it] _just never_ started smelling [i] would [put] [just] [a] little bit _of_ [cat] litter [in there] [because] _if_ [i] [put] [a lot] _one of_ [the cats] would [have] _been_ 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [all] _of_ _her_ _animals_ [that] _she_ ever [had] [were] adopted . 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [i] [that] true [yeah .] [yeah] _she's_ _even_ [got] _she's_ [got] _one_ [dog] [now] _and the_ [two [cats] and] _her_ [dog] [there] [is] [is] basically [a] reject somebody [had] bought him [and] wanted him . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [it was] _her_ ex boyfriend [and you know] [just] [was] [not] mature enough [to] keep [the dog] [didn't] realize _how_ _much_ _work_ [it was] [and] [now] _she's_ stuck _with_ [it .] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] _she's_ [just] [so] kindhearted [that] _she_ [just] takes [all the] _animals_ _but _i_ think_ [that] [for] [me] [well] [my] husband [just] [has] completely nixed [the] [idea] _of having_ [a dog] _or_ _a cat_ [because] [that's] [all] [there] [is] [to] [it .] [so you know] 
A|48| A: [so you] _don't have anything right now_ ? 
B|49| B: _no_ [we] [don't have anything right now] . 
A|50| A: [oh] except [the] [kid] huh [that's] 
B|51| B: [oh] [right _now] we_ [have] _a kid but_ [he] [was] _no_ completely against [having] [a dog] _or_ [cat] [he] said [they're] _much_ [they're] _as much_ _work_ _as_ [a kid] _and they're_ harder [to] [get] rid _of_ _for the_ [weekend and] 
A|52| A: _uh_ [i don't] _i don't know_ [because] [the cats] _pretty_ [much] _um yeah we_ [can] leave _them_ [for a] [weekend] [as] _long_ [as] [we] [put] plenty [of] food _out_ 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: _and um_ _uh_ _it's _not_ _a_ big_ deal [really] _i mean_ [they're] [they're] happier [when] we're [around] [but] _you know they_ [they're] _pretty_ [much] okay _by_ themselves [um] _and i don't_ [you know] [we] _couldn't_ [do] [that] [with] [a dog] . 
B|55| B: [that's] [uh] [yeah] [really] true [. but] [like] [the] _friends_ _other_ _friends_ _of mine_ [have] [cats] [they have] four _of them_ [and] _if _they_ go_ [away] [they have] [they] hire _a pet_ sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day [and] _pet_ [them] [and] things [like] [that] [and] [their] [cats [you know] they're] [so] [used [to] the] [attention] [that] _if _they_ don't_ [get] [it] [they] [get] [really] upset 
A|56| A: [well] [that's] [that's] [um] pampering [the] [the] petals 
B|57| B: [and you know they] sort [of] cause trouble [around] [the] [house] [and] things [like] [that] _. _i_ i_ tried [to] [have] [um] figured something [having] [so i] tried [to] [have] [a] goldfish 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and [um] i] killed [that] _one_ within [a] very short amount [of] [time] . 
A|60| A: [but] _they're _not_ that_ [much] _fun_ [you know] [you] _can't_ [take] [them] [for a] _walk_ [you] _can't_ [you know they] [they don't] [they] _can't_ fetch [you know] 
B|61| B: _right ._ 
A|62| A: [they] [they] _can't_ [do] [anything] [so] i've [never] [i think] _we _had_ fish when i was [a kid_ [but] [i] don't] 
B|63| B: [my] brother [had fish when i was a kid] _i remember_ [that] [and] _one of_ _his_ [fish] jumped [out] [of] [the] [um] gosh _what_ [do] [you] call [it] [fish] _tank_ _. and_ fried itself _on the_ radiator behind [the] dresser . i'll [never] _forget_ [that] [because _i] remember_ [my] brother [he] _came_ home [and] [he] counted [the] [fish] 
A|64| A: [oh] . 
B|65| B: [and] _one of_ [the] [fish] [was] missing _and they_ [couldn't] find [it] anyplace [they] [couldn't] figure [out] _what_ [had] happened [and] then [they] found [it] fried _on the_ radiator behind . 
A|66| A: [oh] . 
B|67| B: [it was] [not] _gross_ [i] [didn't] [see] _it but_ [um] _got [them_ .] 
A|68| A: [oh] . 
B|69| B: trying [to] _remember_ [we [had] [a] dog] _for a while_ [and [i don't] _know] if_ [we got] rid [of] [the dog] [because] [my] brother [was allergic to] [it] [my] brother [had] asthma [and] some [allergies] [which] [i think] he's outgrown [now] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but] [because] [of] [that] [we] [didn't] [have] very many pets afterwards [and] then [he] [had _fish] ._ 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and you] [they're] [like] [you] say [they're not] [the] most exciting _pet_ [to] [have] . 
A|74| A: [no] _it's_ [like] [i] [just] [i don't _know] [i_ i] [just never] understood why [what] [the] attraction _i mean_ [they're] [you know they're] _pretty_ [and] everything [but] i've [just never] seen [the] attraction [of _having] [fish_ .] _it's not_ [as much] _fun_ . 
B|75| B: _well _a_ friend of mine_ [had] [um] _an eel_ 
A|76| A: [an eel] ? 
B|77| B: [and] then [he] _had a _um_ i forget_ [what] type [of] [fish] [it was] [it was] _one of_ [these] [fish] [that] [it] would eat [it] ate [a big] _other_ [fish] [and] things [like] [that] . [there] would [be] sort [of] moby [fish] [in] _a tank_ . 
A|78| A: [oh] [now we] [really] [get] _sick_ 
B|79| B: [yeah [and] _it] [i_ i] [couldn't] [see] [having fish] [like] [that] . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: _i could see_ some [having] [maybe] some [of] [the] tropical [fish] [that] [are] [really] [really] [pretty] [but] 
A|82| A: [like] [i remember] [a friend of mine] _at_ [work] telling [me] [that] _at_ [his] _frat_ [in] college [that] _they [had_ [a] tank] [of] piranha [and] [uh] [you know] [used to] drop _mice_ [in] 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: _this_ [is] [not] [these] aren't [cats you know] 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: _this_ [is] [gross] . 
B|87| B: [yeah] [no] [that] would [be] [what] did [they] [do] everyone come [around] [and] watch [them .] 
A|88| A: yep . 
B|89| B: [i mean] _i guess_ [that's] fine _if you_ [have] [a] mouse problem [at] your [frat] [house] [and] your things destroyed [the] [mice] . 
A|90| A: [yeah] [well] 
B|91| B: [but] 
A|92| A: [yeah] [well [a] cat] [will] [do] [the] same trick 
B|93| B: let's [see] [i _had a] pet rat for a while_ _and it [was_ a] live _rat_ [and um] [this] woman [just] offered [it] [to] [me] _while_ [i _was] in_ [in] graduate school _and _she_ was_ actually [a] very [fun] _pet_ . 
A|94| A: [i had [a] friend] [in] [i had [a] friend] [in] college who [had a um] [had a pet rat for a while] . 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [um i forget] [how] [she] [got] [it but] [it was] [um] [it was] [the] same _kind _of_ a_ deal [i think] [she] [got] [it [i] think] [she [was] a] psych major [and she] [got] [it] _from the_ psych department . 
B|97| B: [yeah] [mine] [had] _been_ [a] [a] [a] [how] did [this] [work] [a] mill [rat] [had] _been_ bought _and the_ _people_ [in the] lab _one_ day called [in] [my] [friend] [and] said [you know] [this] [rat] [is] acting [really] strange [i think] he's [sick] [and she] said [i don't] [think] he's [sick] [i think] _she's_ pregnant 
A|98| A: whoops 
B|99| B: _and [they_ had] misclassed [the] sex [of] back _there and_ [so] [um] [she] asked [me] _if_ [i] want [to] _one of_ those babies [and i] took [the] baby [and i] [got] _her_ [when] [she [was] you know] [just] [this] tiniest little [thing] [like] half [the] price [of a] mouse 
A|100| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [and] then [she] grew [to] [be] [you [know] [i] had] pictures [of] _her_ [when] [she] would sit [on] [my] hand [and] then [she] grew [to] [be] [pretty] [big] [you know] [like] [a] pound _or_ something 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [i don't know] [how] [much] [and [i] had] _her_ [for] over [two] _years_ [and [she] was] very affectionate . [she] would [you know] crawl [on me] [and she] would sit [like] [on] [my] neck _or_ [my] shoulder [while] [i was] working [and] things [like] [that] . [yeah] [much] more _than_ [you] would [think] . 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] _oh [yeah_ [i] mean] [you [know] [if] you] [get] [them] young [and] everything before [they go] _kind of_ nuts [so] . 
B|105| B: [yeah and] 
A|106| A: [yeah] rats [are] [not] [my] favorite [animals] [in the] world [but [i] could see] getting [one] [from] birth [and] everything . 
B|107| B: [yeah i] sort [of] weird [for] [me] [to] [have] [had] [one] too [but] [there] [it [was] a] convenient little [pet] [to] [have] [because] [it] stayed [in] its cage [and you know] [it was] easy . easy [to take] care [of] 
A|108| A: [yeah .] 
B|109| B: [and] [but] 
A|110| A: [yeah [i] [i] i] [have] [friends] [with] hamsters [and] gerbils [and they] [they] tell [me] [the] same [thing .] 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [i] [just] again [it] gets into vivant [much] [fun] [you know] [what [i] guess] [they] [can] [be] [. i] 
B|113| B: actually [it was] more [fun] _than_ [you] would [think] . [yeah] starting [from the] beginning [but] [um yeah we] live also live [in the] city [now] actually [in] manhattan . 
A|114| A: okay . 
B|115| B: [and] [so] [it's] _almost_ impossible [to] [it's not] fair [to] [a pet] [to] [have] [a pet] here _or_ certainly certainly [not a dog] 
A|116| A: [right .] 
B|117| B: [i mean] _people_ [do] 
A|118| A: [oh] [people] 
B|119| B: [but it's not] 
A|120| A: [i don't] [oh] plus [i mean] [the] pooper scooper [one] new york [so you know] . 
B|121| B: [oh [yeah] you] [see] [all] [these] [people] [yeah] [these] stately [people] [and] [well] dressed [people] [out] walking [their] [dogs] [with] [their] plastic bag _or_ [their] piece [of] paper [for] [them] [it's] [really] [kind of] funny . 
A|122| A: [yeah] [uh] [i was] living [in] northern jersey [when] [that] law [came] through [remember] hearing [all] [about] [it] 
B|123| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: [we] [were] wondering [if they] [uh] [they had] [any] special law [for _the] horses_ [in] _central park_ . 
B|125| B: [right] [no] [they don't] [. i] should [make] [you] 
A|126| A: [of] course [not] . 
B|127| B: [they have] [um] _the bags_ behind [them] [but [i] think] [they're] actually supposed [to] keep [them] [yeah] keep [them] [clean] 
A|128| A: hit [the bags] . 
B|129| B: [but] [oh] gosh _i can't_ _even_ [walk] [by] [central park] [yeah] [when] summertime [just] [the] smell [is] [so] _bad_ [of] [the horses] .
