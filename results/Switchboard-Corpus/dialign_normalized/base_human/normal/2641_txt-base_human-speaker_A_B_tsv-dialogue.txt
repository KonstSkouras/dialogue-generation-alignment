A|0| A: okay _, well _,_ _you_ ,_ 
B|1| B: _do_ [you] _have_ _any_ pets ? 
A|2| A: _um _,_ _we_ got_ _two cats ._ 
B|3| B: [two cats .] 
A|4| A: _yeah _, and_ _,_ uh _,_ um , yeah , _we_ had_ _cat _,_ you know _,_ my_ family _had_ [cats] _when_ _we_ _were_ growing _up_ _the whole_ _time_ until _my_ mom developed _an_ _allergies_ , 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _so _,_ _i_ mean _,_ i'm_ _used_ _, i'm_ _used to_ _having cats around_ _, i like_ _them ._ 
B|7| B: _yeah [, i_ like] [having cats around] _or_ pets [around] _in_ general _i , i_ favor _dogs_ over [cats] actually _but ,_ 
A|8| A: _oh ,_ _see _,_ i'm_ _not _,_ uh _,_ i'm_ _not _a dog_ person_ _at_ _all_ 
B|9| B: [oh [,] i'm] [, i'm] [a dog person] _. _i_ had_ _, i guess_ _it_ depends _on_ _what_ [you] [had] [when] _he_ [were] _a kid ,_ _right_ ? 
A|10| A: [yeah ,] probably [, _i] _was_ allergic to_ [dogs] _when i was [a kid_ _,] in_ fact , 
B|11| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: [i] may still _be _,_ um _,_ we_ , 
B|13| B: _but_ [not] [cats .] 
A|14| A: _that _,_ um , i_ wonder _sometimes_ 
B|15| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _um ,_ [but] _we_ _, um _,_ we_ _house_ sat _for _a_ , um _,_ my_ _, um _,_ my_ wife's boss [a] couple weeks _ago_ _and , um _,_ uh _,_ he_ _has_ [a dog] _and_ everything _, we_ [were] _, you know _,_ we_ [were] sitting _the dog_ _and_ everything _and _,_ uh [,_ i] felt [like] _just_ miserable _all_ _weekend_ _and it_ _really_ _didn't_ dawn _on me_ until sunday _, it was_ _like ,_ hey _, maybe_ you're still _allergic _to_ _the_ dog_ _. it was_ _like _,_ _oh ,_ that_ _could_ _be_ _it ._ 
B|17| B: [the] _thing_ _i don't_ [like] _about_ [dogs] [sometimes] _is_ [that] [the] [house] _will_ [just] reek , _of_ [the] [dogs] [, and] constantly . 
A|18| A: _yeah ._ _well ,_ [dogs] _are_ real high maintenances _, you_ _got_ _to take_ _them_ _for_ walks [and] you've _got_ _to_ pay _a lot _,_ you know _,_ you_ need _to_ pay _attention_ _to_ _cats and_ everything _but it's not_ quite [the] same _thing ._ 
B|19| B: [yeah _,] that's_ true . 
A|20| A: _um _,_ and , um _,_ um _,_ you know _,_ it's_ _, it's_ [just] nice [that] _cats , you know ,_ _cats _,_ yeah , you_ _don't have_ _to_ let _them_ outside _, you know ,_ _all_ [cats] _are_ indoor _cats ,_ 
B|21| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|22| A: _so _, you know _,_ they're_ _not_ ,_ you're [not] worried [about] _them_ running all-around [the] neighborhood _and , you know , _they_ _,_ you know , _they_ _,_ they_ _make_ _their_ mess _in the_ _cat_ _pan_ _which_ _is ,_ 
B|23| B: limited . 
A|24| A: [yeah _,] it's_ _, you know _,_ it's_ [a] pain _to_ _clean_ [but _,] you know _,_ _we_ used _to_ [,_ _i] mean _,_ they_ _got_ great stuff _out_ _now_ _for_ cleaning cats' pans . _they_ _didn't_ , 
B|25| B: [oh ,] [really] ? 
A|26| A: _well ,_ _when i _was_ , you know ,_ _when i was_ growing _up_ _i had a_ _clean_ [the] _cat_ _pan_ _all the_ _time_ _, and i_ hated [it] _because [i_ had] _to_ carry everything upstairs _and , you know [,_ and] use _this_ _thing _to_ _,_ you know ,_ scoop _the ,_ _take the_ stuff _out_ [and] _put_ [it] _in the_ toilet [and] everything _it was_ [really] terrible _. but_ _now_ _they have_ [like] _this_ _, you_ _get_ _these_ liners _, that_ [is] _garbage_ _bags_ _, you know ,_ 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: _and you [,_ _and] you _,_ you know_ _the ,_ 
B|29| B: [oh , that] sounds [so] easy _, what_ [i] did , 
A|30| A: [yeah _,] _the_ cats_ _do it_ _in there _,_ you_ pull [it] [and] _take_ [it] _out_ [and] throw [it] _away [,_ and] [that's] _it ,_ 
B|31| B: _yeah , i_ housesat _from_ [cats] [for _a] friend of mine_ [which] _she was_ finishing [up] _her_ thesis , 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: [and] _what_ [we used to] [do] [was] [just] [put] [, um ,] newspaper _on the_ bottom [and] then [put] [cat] litter [and] then [i] would [just] [take [the] whole] [thing [to] the] [garbage] _can_ [and] dump [the whole] [thing .] 
A|34| A: same _idea_ 
B|35| B: then [i] would [do [it] [,] you know ,] _everyday_ _or_ [two] days [so] [i] would [clean] [that] [pan] very , very rarely , 
A|36| A: [everyday] ? 
B|37| B: [and] [so] [it] _wasn't_ [so] _bad_ . 
A|38| A: [oh ,] okay [, i] _see_ . 
B|39| B: [two [cats] and] [just] _as_ easy [it] _just never_ started smelling [, i] would [put] [just] [a] little bit _of_ [cat] litter [in there ,] [because] _if_ [i] [put] [a lot ,] _one of_ [the cats] would [have] _been_ , 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [all] _of_ _her_ _animals_ [that] _she_ ever [had] [were] adopted . 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [i] [that] true [, [yeah] .] [yeah _,] she's_ _even_ [got] _, she's_ [got] _one_ [dog] [now] _and the_ [two [cats] and] _her_ [dog] [there] [is ,] [is] basically [a] reject , somebody [had] bought him [, and] wanted him . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [it was] _her_ ex boyfriend [and , you know ,] [just] [was] [not] mature enough [to] keep [the dog] , [didn't] realize _how_ _much_ _work_ [it was] [and] [now] _, she's_ stuck _with_ [it .] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] _she's_ [just] [so] kindhearted [that] _she_ [just] takes [all the] _animals_ _but _i_ think_ [that] [for] [me] [, well [,] my] husband [just] [has] completely nixed [the] [idea] _of having_ [a dog] _or_ _a cat_ [because] [that's] [all] [there] [is] [to] [it .] [so , you know ,] 
A|48| A: [so , you] _don't have anything right now_ ? 
B|49| B: _no [,_ we] [don't have anything right now] . 
A|50| A: [oh ,] except [the] [kid ,] huh [, _that's] ,_ 
B|51| B: [oh ,] [right] _, now we_ [have] _a kid but_ [he] [was ,] _no ,_ completely against [having] [a dog] _or_ [cat [,] he] said [, they're] _much [,_ they're] _as much_ _work_ _as_ [a kid [,] _and] they're_ harder [to] [get] rid _of_ _for the_ [weekend] [, and ,] 
A|52| A: _uh _,_ i don't_ _, _i don't_ know_ [because] [the cats] _pretty_ [much _,] um , yeah , we_ [can] leave _them_ [for a] [weekend] [as] _long_ [as] [we] [put] plenty [of] food _out_ , 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: _and , um _,_ uh _,_ it's _not_ _a_ big_ deal _really [,_ _i] mean_ _they're [,_ they're] happier [when] we're [around] [but _,] you know , _they_ [,_ they're] _pretty_ [much] okay _by_ themselves [, um _,] and i don't_ [, you know [,] we] _couldn't_ [do] [that] [with] [a dog] . 
B|55| B: [that's [,] uh [,] yeah ,] [really] true [. but] [like] [the] _friends_ , _other_ _friends_ _of mine_ [have] [cats [,] [they] have] four _of them_ [, and] _if _they_ go_ [away [,] [they] have] [, they] hire _a pet_ sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day [and] _pet_ [them] [and] things [like] [that] [and] [their] [cats [, you know ,] they're] [so] [used [to] the] [attention] [, that] _if _they_ don't_ [get] [it [,] they] [get] [really] upset , 
A|56| A: [well [,] [that's] [,] [that's] [,] um ,] pampering _the _,_ the_ petals 
B|57| B: [and , you know , they] sort [of] cause trouble [around] [the] [house] [and] things [like] [that] _. _i ,_ i_ tried [to] [have] [, um ,] figured something [having] _, so_ [i] tried [to] [have] [a] goldfish , 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and [, um ,] i] killed [that] _one_ within [a] very short amount [of] [time] . 
A|60| A: [but] _they're _not_ that_ [much] _fun_ [, you know [,] you] _can't_ [take] [them] [for a] _walk_ [, you] _can't_ [, you know , _they] _,_ they don't_ [, they] _can't_ fetch [, you know ,] 
B|61| B: _right ._ 
A|62| A: [they] [they] _can't_ [do] [anything] [, so] i've [never] _, i think_ _we _had_ fish when i was [a kid_ [but] [i] don't] , 
B|63| B: [my] brother [had fish when i was a kid] _i remember_ [that [,] and] _one of_ _his_ [fish] jumped [out] [of] [the [,] um ,] gosh _, what_ [do] [you] call [it ,] [fish] _tank_ _. and_ fried itself , _on the_ radiator behind [the] dresser . i'll [never] _forget_ [that] [because _i] remember_ [my] brother [, he] _came_ home [and] [he] counted [the] [fish] 
A|64| A: [oh] . 
B|65| B: [and] _one of_ [the] [fish] [was] missing _and they_ [couldn't] find [it] anyplace [, they] [couldn't] figure [out] _what_ [had] happened [and] then [they] found [it] fried [on] [, the] radiator behind . 
A|66| A: [oh] . 
B|67| B: [it was] [not] _gross_ [, i] [didn't] [see] [it] [but [,] um ,] _got [them_ .] 
A|68| A: [oh] . 
B|69| B: trying [to] _remember_ [we [had] [a] dog] _for a while_ [, and [i don't] know] _if_ [we got] rid [of] [the dog] [because] [my] brother [was allergic to] [it [,] my] brother [had] asthma [and] some [allergies] [which] [i think] he's outgrown [now] , 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but] [because] [of] [that] [we] [didn't] [have] very many pets afterwards [and] then [he] [had _fish] ._ 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and you _,] they're ,_ [like] [you] say [, they're not] [the] most exciting _pet_ [to] [have] . 
A|74| A: [no _,] it's_ _like [,_ i] _just _,_ [i don't_ _know] _, i_ , i_ [just never] understood why [, what] [the] attraction [, _i] mean [,_ they're [,] you know , they're] _pretty_ [and] everything [but] i've [just never] seen [the] attraction [of _having] [fish_ .] _it's not_ [as much] _fun_ . 
B|75| B: _well , _a_ friend of mine_ [had] [, um ,] _an eel_ , 
A|76| A: [an eel] ? 
B|77| B: [and] then [he] _had a [, _um ,_ i] forget_ [what] type [of] [fish] _it was [,_ it was] _one of_ [these] [fish] [that] [it] would eat [, it] ate [a big] _other_ [fish] [and] things [like] [that] . [there] would [be] sort [of] moby [fish] [in] _a tank_ . 
A|78| A: [oh [,] now we] [really] [get] _sick_ 
B|79| B: [yeah , [and] _it] [, i_ , i] [couldn't] [see] [having fish] [like] [that] . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: _i could see_ some [having] [, maybe] some [of] [the] tropical [fish] [, that] [are] [really ,] [really] [pretty] [but ,] 
A|82| A: _like [,_ [i] remember] [a friend of mine] _at_ [work] telling [me] [that] _at_ [his] _frat_ [in] college [that] _they [had_ [a] tank] [of] piranha [, and [,] uh [,] you know ,] [used to] drop _mice_ [in] 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: _this_ [is] _not _,_ these_ aren't [cats , you know ,] 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: _this_ [is] [gross] . 
B|87| B: [yeah ,] [no [,] that] would [be [,] what] did [they] [do] , everyone come [around] [and] watch [them .] 
A|88| A: yep . 
B|89| B: [i mean _,] i guess_ [that's] fine _if you_ [have] [a] mouse problem [at] your [frat] [house] [, and] your things destroyed [the] [mice] . 
A|90| A: [yeah [,] well ,] 
B|91| B: [but ,] 
A|92| A: [yeah [,] [well ,] [a] cat] [will] [do] [the] same trick 
B|93| B: let's [see _,] i _had a_ pet rat_ , _for a while_ [, _and] it [was_ a] live _rat_ [, and , um _,] this_ woman [just] offered [it] [to] [me] _while_ [i _was] in_ [, in] graduate school _and , _she_ was_ actually [a] very [fun] _pet_ . 
A|94| A: [i had [a] friend] [in] [i had [a] friend] [in] college who [had a , um ,] [had a pet rat] [for a while] . 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [um , i forget] [how] [she] [got] [it ,] [but] [it was [,] um [,] it was] [the] same _kind _of_ a_ deal [i think] [she] [got] [it _, i] think_ [she [was] a] psych major _and she_ [got] [it] _from the_ psych department . 
B|97| B: [yeah ,] [mine] [had] _been_ [a [,] [a] [,] a] [how] did [this] [work] [, a] mill [rat] [had] _been_ bought _and the_ _people_ [in the] lab _one_ day called [in] [my] [friend] [and] said [, you know _,] this_ [rat] [is] acting [really] strange [i think] he's [sick] [, [and] she] said [, i don't] [think] he's [sick] [, i think] _she's_ pregnant , 
A|98| A: whoops 
B|99| B: _and [they_ had] misclassed [the] sex [of] back _there and_ [so [,] um _,] she_ asked [me] _if_ [i] want [to ,] _one of_ those babies [, and i] took [the] baby [and i] [got] _her_ [when] [she [was] , you know ,] [just] [this] tiniest little [thing] [like ,] half [the] price [of a] mouse , 
A|100| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [and] then [she] grew [to] [be [,] you [know _,] i] had_ pictures [of] _her_ [when] [she] would sit [on] [my] hand [and] then [she] grew [to] [be] [pretty] [big] [, you know ,] [like] [a] pound _or_ something 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [i don't know] [how] [much [,] and [i] had] _her_ [for] over [two] _years_ [and [she] was] very affectionate . [she] would [, you know ,] crawl [on me] [and she] would sit [like] [on] [my] neck _or_ [my] shoulder [while] [i was] working [, and] things [like] [that] . [yeah ,] [much] more _than_ [you] would [think] . 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] _oh , [yeah ,_ [i] mean [,] you know ,] [if you] [get] [them] young [and] everything before [they go] , _kind of_ nuts [, so] . 
B|105| B: [yeah] [and ,] 
A|106| A: [yeah ,] rats [are] [not] [my] favorite [animals] [in the] world , [but [i] could see] getting [one] [from] birth [and] everything . 
B|107| B: _yeah , i ,_ sort [of] weird [for] [me] [to] [have] [had] [one] too [but] [there [,] it [was] a] convenient little [pet] [to] [have] [because] [it] stayed [in] its cage [and , you know [,] it was] easy . easy [to take] care [of] 
A|108| A: [yeah .] 
B|109| B: [and] [but ,] 
A|110| A: [yeah [, i [,] i] , i] [have] [friends] [with] hamsters [and] gerbils [and _they] [,_ they] tell [me] [the] same [thing .] 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [i] _just ,_ again [it] gets into vivant [much] [fun] [, you know] [what] [, i guess] [they] [can] [be] [. i ,] 
B|113| B: actually [it was] more [fun] _than_ [you] would [think] . [yeah ,] starting [from the] beginning [but [,] um , yeah , we] live , also live [in the] city [now] , actually [in] manhattan . 
A|114| A: okay . 
B|115| B: [and] [so] [it's] _almost_ impossible [to [,] it's not] fair [to] [a pet] [to] [have] [a pet] here _, or_ certainly , certainly [not a dog] , 
A|116| A: [right .] 
B|117| B: [i mean ,] _people_ [do] , 
A|118| A: [oh] _people ,_ 
B|119| B: [but it's [not] ,]

B|121| B: [oh [, yeah ,] you] [see] [all] [these] [people [,] yeah [,] these] stately [people [,] and] [well] dressed [people] [out] walking [their] [dogs] [with] [their] plastic bag _or_ [their] piece [of] paper [for] [them] [, it's] [really] [kind of] funny . 
A|122| A: [yeah [,] uh [,] [i] was] living [in] northern jersey [when] [that] law [came] through , [remember] hearing [all] [about] [it ,] 
B|123| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: [we] [were] wondering [if _they] [,_ uh [,] [they] had] [any] special law [for _the] horses_ [in] _central park_ . 
B|125| B: [right] , [no [,] they don't] [. i] should [make] [you ,] 
A|126| A: [of] course , [not] . 
B|127| B: [they have] [, um [,] _the] bags_ behind [them] [but [i] think] [they're] actually supposed [to ,] keep [them] [, yeah ,] keep [them] [clean] 
A|128| A: hit [the bags] . 
B|129| B: [but [,] oh ,] gosh _, i can't_ _even_ [walk] [by] [central park] [yeah] [when] summertime , [just] [the] smell [is] [so] _bad_ [of] [the horses] . 
A|130| A: [oh ,] god [, i can't] , haven't [been] [up] [there ,] last [time] [i was] [there] [was] fall [so] probably [wasn't] [that] [bad]
