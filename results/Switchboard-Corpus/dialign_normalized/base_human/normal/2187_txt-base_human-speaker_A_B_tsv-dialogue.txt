A|0| A: _okay ._ 
B|1| B: _what_ _, what_ _is _,_ do _you_ _have_ a_ favorite _recipe ?_ 
A|2| A: _um _,_ yeah _,_ that's_ [what] _it_ said _to_ discuss _some_ maybe _a recipe_ _, well _,_ it_ says , why _would_ [you] [, what] [you] _would_ [have] _for_ [a] dinner party . _um ,_ this [is] strange _because i_ pressed one _and_ _i_ thought _it_ said begin . 
B|3| B: _oh_ . 
A|4| A: _okay ,_ maybe , maybe we're all set _. _okay_ ,_ we'll talk _for_ five minutes _, they_ interrupt at _the_ end . _um _,_ yeah _,_ it_ says [what] [you] _would_ [have] _for_ [a] dinner party _, _i_ just_ happen _to_ plan one _out_ _for_ saturday i'll tell [you] [, what] i'm going _to have_ . _um ,_ if _i_ can find _it_ . 
B|5| B: _oh [,_ that's] wonderful [. [okay] .] 
A|6| A: _well _,_ _i_ have_ this new _fondue_ pot _and_ _i_ was going _to_ [do] basic _cheese_ _fondue _,_ and_ _i have_ two different _kinds of_ breads _and_ _some_ ham _and_ _i_ was going _to_ try something weird which _, you know ,_ when [you have] fish au gratin _, i_ was going _to_ make _some_ _, uh ,_ _like_ fish chunks _and_ _dip_ _it in the_ _fondue_ _. i_ don't _know_ if _it_ will come _out_ . 
B|7| B: _that's [,_ what] _kind of_ [fondue _,] the cheese_ [dip] _or ,_ 
A|8| A: _yeah [,_ the cheese] [fondue] _i_ make , _some_ _people_ _like_ swiss _, um _,_ i_ prefer cheddar . _and_ i'll _mix_ _, i_ won't make _, i_ won't [have a] sharp cheddar _because_ _it _,_ for_ [fondue] _i think it_ should _be a_ little calmer _than_ real sharp , cheddar . 
B|9| B: _right_ _. _yeah_ ._ 
A|10| A: _and then_ _i_ was going _to_ make _other_ things _like_ potato skins . 
B|11| B: _oh _,_ that_ sounds _good ._ 
A|12| A: see [you] don't necessarily _have to_ [dip] this _stuff_ . _and _,_ um _,_ i_ was going _to have_ broccoli _and_ cauliflower _for_ [a] , [a] _vegetable_ . 
B|13| B: [that's] _always_ _a good_ _thing_ . [vegetable] _trays_ _always_ _go_ _over_ _so_ [well ,] [because [i] think] [people] _get_ tired [of] eating junk [. _i] mean _,_ _i think_ they_ [like] [to have] healthy [stuff] _too_ [, you know] _it's ,_ 
A|14| A: _oh _, yeah_ ,_ [it's] amazing _how_ vegetables [trays] will [go] at [a] party . 
B|15| B: [oh ,] _definitely_ _. i think_ _better_ _even_ [than] , [than] [other] [kinds of] _food_ 
A|16| A: _yeah ,_ instead [of] something greasy [or ,] 
B|17| B: _right_ , exactly _. _yeah_ ._ 
A|18| A: my _, uh ,_ girlfriends [do] catering _and_ [they] [always] , about every party [they] [do] [is] [they] [have a] [vegetable] tray [. [i think] they] try _and_ suggest _it_ . 
B|19| B: uh-huh . 
A|20| A: [what] _i've_ _been_ doing when [i] [get] invited someplace _and_ bring something [, i] make _, uh ,_ [food] kabobs . [you] _take_ little toothpicks _and_ _cut_ up _, uh ,_ pineapple _and_ strawberry _, and_ [even] banana if [you] can [do] _it_ _just_ _before_ [you] leave . 
B|21| B: [oh] . yes . _right_ . 
A|22| A: _it_ stays nice _and_ fresh . 
B|23| B: _right_ [, that's] true . [or] [even] [have] [you] ever seen _where_ _they ,_ they'll [take] [a] _watermelon_ [and] [just] _cut _the_ top_ _out of_ _it [and_ then] hollow _that_ [out] [, [and] then] _put the_ _fruit_ [in _the] watermelon_ _that_ [is] _really_ _neat ._ 
A|24| A: [yeah [.] _yeah] [,_ i] [like] those 
B|25| B: _yep ._ 
A|26| A: _um _,_ [they_ _,] they_ made [a] couple [of] those _, uh _,_ they_ made one _for_ my _, uh ,_ bridal shower [and] [i] was pretty pleased [. i] _never_ made one _for_ myself though . _but_ [they] look easy enough [to] make [it's] _not_ , 
B|27| B: [oh _,] [i think_ _it] would_ _, it would_ [be _a] lot of_ _work_ _but , um [,_ you know ,] _because _it's_ [,_ you know ,] 
A|28| A: [yeah .] 
B|29| B: [you [have] to] [cut] each _thing_ [or [,] you know ,] _use_ [the] melon baller _and stuff_ _but _,_ but _i_ think _they're_ really_ _neat_ [and [,] you know _,] _i think_ they're_ worth [the] _time [,_ you know ,] [because] [they ,] 
A|30| A: _yeah [,_ you] _probably_ [get] this , _probably_ pretty sticky after _you get_ done . 
B|31| B: [oh , yeah] 
A|32| A: [then] you've got [to] drain [the] water [out of] [the watermelon] [because] [, you know ,] when [you] scrape _it [,_ it] makes [the] water . 
B|33| B: _right_ [. [yeah] .] 
A|34| A: _yeah [,_ um ,] something [i] [do] [is] [a] [fruit] _, [is_ ,] i'll [get] [, um ,] make _chocolate_ sauce [and] [dip] _strawberries_ [and] bananas [in] them [. _yeah] [,_ _i] have_ two nieces [and] [they _,] they_ [they] [go] melt _some_ _chocolate_ chips , [go] buy me _some_ _strawberries_ . 
B|35| B: [is] _that [,_ is] _that_ _good_ ? [you know ,] [i've] seen _that_ _so_ many times , [strawberries] dipped [in] [chocolate] [but] [i've] [never] tried [it ,] _are_ [they] _really good_ ? 
A|36| A: _yeah [,_ you know ,] if _you get a_ sweet strawberry [they're] much [better] [, but] if _you get a_ sour strawberry , 
B|37| B: [oh [,] i] bet _it doesn't_ [mix] [well ,] _does_ [it] ? 
A|38| A: _huh [._ _yeah] ,_ no _, [they_ [,] um [,] the] [strawberries] [are] coming _in season_ now from , [they're] , [they're] coming up from florida , _of course_ [. i] live [in] vermont , [so] . [but] [they're really] reasonably priced , [they're] coming up from florida , [so] . 
B|39| B: [oh [,] well [,] that's] _good_ [because i] [know] they've [been] [really] expensive lately . [because] [they] weren't [in season] , 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: _of course [,_ they] _had_ _to be_ , [be] [, uh ,] grown [in] greenhouses _and stuff_ [and] [in] , 
A|42| A: _yeah [,_ i think] _the [,_ uh ,] actually [i think they] [get] [, um ,] _some_ [of] them from south america . 
B|43| B: [oh [,] is] _that_ _right_ ? 
A|44| A: [yep] [, [they] ,] [a lot of] [, um ,] [of] [a] [, um ,] winter produce comes from south america . 
B|45| B: [oh [,] i] . 
A|46| A: [of course ,] _their_ seasons [are] switched . 
B|47| B: uh-huh . _right_ . 
A|48| A: [so] [, um [,] do you] _want to_ discuss [the] [recipe ?] 
B|49| B: [well ,] 
A|50| A: _i [have_ _a] recipe_ if [you] _want_ 
B|51| B: [okay ,] sure , 
A|52| A: [um [,] it] filled , [a lot of] [people] try [to] stay away from this [but i] make my _own_ homemade _pudding_ [just] [because i] don't [like] box _pudding_ . 
B|53| B: [is] _that_ _right_ ? [i've] [never] heard [of] _that ._ 
A|54| A: _yeah [,_ [it] [,] and] [it] if [you] [, um [,] well ,] first [of] all [i] [take] about [a] quarter [and] [a] half [of] _milk_ [and] [i] _put it in_ [a] two quart _saucepan_ [and] _you put it_ _on_ [a] [really] low heat . 
B|55| B: uh-huh . 
A|56| A: [and] [you] _want _to_ use_ one [of] _your_ [good] sauce pans [that] dissipate [the] heat [because] [it [,] it] ends up burning [, [i] mean ,] no matter _how_ careful [you] _are you_ still might _get a_ film _on_ [the] bottom [of] [the] pot . 
B|57| B: uh-huh . 
A|58| A: [i] don't let [that] worry me . [and] [i] [get] _the milk_ lukewarm [and then] [i] pour about [a] half [a] cup [of] _cornstarch_ [in] [it and] _i have_ this [thing] [it's] called [the] slender blender [, [it] [,] it] makes _the [,_ uh [,] it] makes [, uh ,] [a] whip topping [out of] _milk_ if _you get_ _the milk_ cold enough . [it's [,] uh [,] i] don't [know ,] [they're] called moo goo leaves [or] something [they're] 
B|59| B: [i think] [i] [know] [what] _you're_ [is] _it _like_ _a_ hand_ held ? 
A|60| A: [yeah .] [they're] real [neat .] 
B|61| B: [the [,] yeah ,] [okay .] 
A|62| A: [i think they're] real reasonably priced , _some_ [of] them [, they] used [to [be] a] hundred dollars [and] [they] used [to] whip skim _milk_ into [a] dessert [but i] didn't [get] [that] one [, i] got [the] black [and] decker [kind] . [but [,] uh ,] [it's] real handy [because] [it doesn't] [have a] cord [and] [you] beat this _cornstarch_ [right] into [the] _the milk_ [, you know [,] and] [it] [does] an excellent job , [or] [just] [hand] beat [it] [. i] guess [you] could [use] [a hand] mixer [but i] don't [think it] [i] don't [think it] gets [it] [good] enough . 
B|63| B: uh-huh . [huh .] 
A|64| A: [and then] _before_ _the milk_ gets [too] hot [, um [,] i] add two beaten eggs [and] [i] [really] [mix] them [in] [good .] [and then] about [a] half [a] cup [of] sugar [and] [i] let [it] pretty much [, i] beat [it like] every minute _for_ about ten seconds [and] [it's [,] it] starts thickening , when [it] thickens _the cornstarch_ might _get a_ little [, i] don't [know [,] it] gets [like] little globs [of] this rubbery _cornstarch_ [, and] [you] [just] keep beating _it in_ . [and] [it's] [the [,] the] trick [is [,] is] [to have] this blender , [so] , if [you] were , you'd [have to] _probably_ almost [go] [out] [and] someone who's [just] going [to] make [it] first [time ,] [it's ,] you'll [have] much [better] luck if [you] [had] one [of] these little blenders . [and then] [you] can add cocoa powder [to] [it] [to] make [chocolate] [or] after [it's] thickened [i] cook [it] _for_ [a good] , once [it] starts boiling [, _i] just_ [, i] cook [it] _for_ [a good] seven minutes , seven [to] ten minutes 
B|65| B: uh-huh . 
A|66| A: [and then] [you] can make [chocolate] [or] [you] can [take] [it] off [and] let [it] cool _you put_ [, um ,] [really good] vanilla favoring [in] [it and] _some_ butter [and] [that] makes french vanilla [, um ,] custard [. [yeah] ,] 
B|67| B: [oh ,] wow . [that] [is] [really] interesting . [are you] saying [to use] _like [,_ um [,] for] [chocolate] _like ,_ _unsweetened_ , 
A|68| A: [a] [chocolate] powder . 
B|69| B: _unsweetened_ ? 
A|70| A: [yeah [,] that] cocoa [, yeah [,] the] [unsweetened] . [it] comes [in] [like a] real dark can , 
B|71| B: [yeah .] 
A|72| A: our mothers used [to use] [it] . [and then] , 
B|73| B: [i have] [some] 
A|74| A: [yeah ,] we all used _to ,_ 
B|75| B: [i just] [want [to] ,] 
A|76| A: [yeah ,] [it's] [the] [unsweetened] [kind] [it's] _not_ [like] nestles quik . 
B|77| B: [right] [. [okay] .] 
A|78| A: [i] suppose [you] could [use] [that .] 
B|79| B: cooking [chocolate] . 
A|80| A: [yeah [,] [but] , um ,] 
B|81| B: [that's] [really] interesting , [i've] [never] heard [of] anybody making [their] [own] [pudding] [before] [that's] [really] [neat .] 
A|82| A: [well [,] i] used [to] make [the] regular [pudding] [, the] [chocolate] [and] _put it in the_ pie shell [and] if [it would] sit _in the refrigerator_ [for] [a] day , [where] [you] [cut the] pie [, it would] soak into [the] pie shell [and] [it] was [like] red [, and] i'm [like ,] [oh ,] this [is] [kind of] groedy . 
B|83| B: [well ,] [how] did [you get [a] recipe] [for] [pudding] [on] [your] [own] ? 
A|84| A: [um ,] actually [i] found _it in_ one [of] my mother's [, um ,] homemade cookbooks [, [i] mean ,] something she [had] collected [out of] woman's day [or] something . 
B|85| B: [is] [that] [right] ? [oh ,] [neat] , 
A|86| A: [so] , 
B|87| B: [that] [is] [just] [really] [neat .] [because _i] ,_ 
A|88| A: [i think] [you] couldn't make [it] with [a hand] whisk [or ,] [or] [a] regular beater [but , um ,] 
B|89| B: [it would] [probably] [be [a] lot] _more_ _work_ [and] [probably] [not] turn [out] _as_ [good .] 
A|90| A: [yeah [,] but i] still [think] [a] beater [would] [do] [it] [good] enough [, um [,] the] trick [is] [to] [get] _the cornstarch_ , 
B|91| B: uh-huh . 
A|92| A: [um [,] yeah ,] [right] [in [the] ,] [in the] lukewarm _milk_ . sometimes [i] [put _the] cornstarch_ [in] [a] separate bowl [and] [i] [would] _put it in the_ sink [and] i'll [take] my lukewarm _milk_ [and] _put it _in the_ cornstarch_ [and] beat [it] [good .] [it] seems [to be] [better] [than] putting [the [,] _the] cornstarch_ into [the] liquid [it ,] once [it] hits [the top] [of] [the] liquid [it] seems [to] make little balls [and stuff] [on] [the top] . 
B|93| B: _so [you_ [put] [the] milk] [in the cornstarch] ? 
A|94| A: [yeah .] [and] i'll [do] this [, uh ,] sometimes i'll [put] my after [i] pour [that] into my , _back_ into my _saucepan_ . i'll [put the] eggs [in the] same dish [and] beat them up [and then] pour [the cornstarch] [and] [the milk] mixture [in the] egg . [so] , 
B|95| B: [and then] [put] [that] [back] [in _the] saucepan_ ? 
A|96| A: [yep .] [and then] [, you know ,] if [you] can [put] [your] cocoa [in] with [your] [cornstarch] if [you] wanted [to] . [the] cocoa [even] seems [to] thicken [it] [even] [more] . 
B|97| B: [huh] _that's ,_ 
A|98| A: [because] by [the] vanilla [doesn't] seem [to] thicken [as] [well] [as] [the ,] sometimes [the] cocoa [is] [like ,] my husband [really] likes [it] thick he says [, i] can stick [the] spoon [right] [in] this . 
B|99| B: [oh] . 
A|100| A: [because] i'm [always] worrying [it] won't firm up [because] [it ,] when [you] [take] [it] [out of] [the saucepan] [it's] [like ,] boy [, i] hope this thickens [a] little [more] [because it's] [not] [like] real package thick [, you know ,] when [you] cook [a] package , [it's ,] [it's] [a] little less , 
B|101| B: uh-huh . 
A|102| A: [but i] _put it in_ [a] nice glass bowl [and [,] um ,] [some] [people] don't [like] [that [,] [that] ,] film [on] [the] [pudding] [so you] can [put] [, uh ,] saran wrap [over] [the top] . 
B|103| B: uh-huh . 
A|104| A: [and then] once [the] [pudding] starts cooling [it] makes little balls [of] water [on] [the] saran wrap , [so] , when [you] pull [the] saran wrap [back] [, you] sort [of] should [be a] little careful , pull [it] [back] [and] shake [the] water off [the] saran wrap [and] [i] might _put it_ [back] [on] . [but , um ,] 
B|105| B: [do] [do [you] _put it] in the refrigerator_ [then] [or] 
A|106| A: [yeah ,] after [, well] when [it] starts steaming [a lot] [, uh [,] i] [definitely] [, yeah ,] [put it in the refrigerator] , 
B|107| B: uh-huh . 
A|108| A: [but , um [,] [i] ,] my father [always] told me if [you put] hot [food] [in] [your] [refrigerator] [you're] going [to] make [it] [work] [too] hard . 
B|109| B: [right] [, that's] true [. i] knew [that .] 
A|110| A: [that's [,] yeah ,] 
B|111| B: [yeah .] 
A|112| A: [so] [, that's] why [i] [do] [that .] 
B|113| B: [yeah .] 
A|114| A: [so] [, well [,] i] don't [know] [that's] my , my great hard [recipe] .
