B|37| B: [oh [.] _i] have_ one [of] _those_ [. yeah .] 
A|38| A: _well ,_ _then_ [, um ,] 
B|39| B: mine's broke _at_ [the] moment _, but_ 
A|40| A: _yeah ,_ ours really needs _to have_ [some] work done _on_ [it] [but [,] but] _then_ [my husband] [, um ,] worked [at] t [i] [and i] [got] [a] [, um ,] this [has] [been] [years] ago _he_ doesn't work _there_ anymore [, but] _he_ [got] [a] [, um [,] uh , the] [, the] t [i] professional [and] brought [that] _home [and_ _i] learned wordstar_ _on_ _that ,_ 
B|41| B: [oh .] 
A|42| A: _and ,_ boy _once_ [that] happened , _there_ _was_ [just] no way _that i_ _could_ ever [go] back [to] doing anything [of] length [of the] typewriter . 
B|43| B: [yeah [,] [i] learned] [, _i] , [i_ learned wordstar] [, uh [,] _i] did some_ typing [for] [my] father [when] [he] [had] [the] _company_ 
A|44| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|45| B: [and] _so [i_ learned] _that on_ [there] _too_ _, that was_ , 
A|46| A: [yeah .] [have] _you_ ever [used] , _do you_ [use] wordperfect ever ? [have] _you_ ever [used] wordperfect ? _or_ , 
B|47| B: [i] haven't _. that's_ [the] one [that] [my] father [, well , i] guess _i have_ _used it_ [once] [or] twice . 
A|48| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|49| B: [uh _,] it's_ [the] one _that's_ _on my_ father-in-law's _computer_ . 
A|50| A: _right ._ 
B|51| B: he's [got] [on] [i b m] . 
A|52| A: [yeah ,] [yeah [.] that's] probably where you've [used [it] .] 
B|53| B: _and , uh , _so_ that's_ [the] program [that] [they're] _using_ [there] . 
A|54| A: _uh-huh . yeah ._ [um [,] [i] have] [that [on] [my] [,] uh ,] [computer] _here and_ [also] [, um [,] i] [do] [some] work [at] u t d [and , uh [,] _that's] what_ [they have] [there] [and] [it] [was] [just] [so] nice [to] [be able] _just to_ step _into the_ position [and [,] and] already _know_ [the] _you know_ , already _know_ [the] [, the] [software] . [and [,] um [,] [i] don't] _know_ [from] [my] own experience [, um ,] wordperfect [is] [just] [so] _much_ _better_ than , than [wordstar] _at least_ [the] version [of] [wordstar] _that i_ [used] _to have_ . [it] may [be] improved by now [but ,] 
B|55| B: [that's what] _i've_ heard . 
A|56| A: [yeah [,] it's] [, uh ,] [wordstar] [was] never very intuitive [to] _me [._ i] mean _you know_ _, you_ , [some] [of the] commands [just] [had] nothing [to do] _with_ _, you know_ _, what_ _you_ were supposed [to] [be] doing [what] [they] _, what_ [they] [did] [on] [the computer] [but [,] uh ,] 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [i] mean like _going_ [, um ,] forward [and] backward [a] [word] [or] _up_ [and] _down_ [a] line [that] sort [of thing] [just] _, you know_ , didn't match _with the_ kinds [of] keys _, you_ were [using] . 
B|59| B: [yeah [,] _you] had [to_ ,] memorize _it ,_ 
A|60| A: [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [and ,] 
A|62| A: [and [,] but] wordperfect [is] [just] [a] _lot_ more intuitive [in] [a] _lot_ [of] ways . [and] [you] [, and] [it] does [a] _lot_ _of things_ [too] [that] _if_ [you] _, if_ [you] [do] any _kind [of ,_ uh ,] research [or] anything like [that] where [you] [have] [to [,] uh ,] [use] footnotes _, it_ [is] [just] _wonderful ._ because [it] keeps track [of] all your footnotes . 
B|63| B: [oh _.] oh [,_ that's] _neat ._ 
A|64| A: [yeah [,] and] _if_ [you] add [it _,] if_ [you] [put] [a] footnote [in] , [in the] middle _, you know_ _, if_ [you] come _up_ _with_ [some] new piece [of] documentation [and] [you] [put] [that] [in the] middle [of] your paper [and] [have] [to] footnote _it , you_ [just] change [, um _,] it_ [just] automatically changes all your footnoting numbers _for you ._ 
B|65| B: [oh ,] _how_ [wonderful .] 
A|66| A: [so _,] you know_ [, it's] [just] , 
B|67| B: [that [,] [i] had] heard _that _that_ was_ [better] . _that _was_ a_ [better] one . 
A|68| A: _yeah [. yeah_ .] [and i] think [about] [how] [it] [used] [to] [be] _if_ [you] were doing [a] paper [and] [you had to] [go] back [and] retype everything [, and] [oh _,] it_ [was] [just] awful . [so [,] um [,] [i] don't] _know_ [i] think [we] [have] [just] become really spoiled _. but_ [i] think [, it's] [a] nice [kind of] way [to] [be] spoiled 
B|69| B: [yeah [. yeah] [,] i] agree 
A|70| A: [so [,] um [,] well , [i] have] [not] really paid _much_ attention because [i] clock , although [i] think _we've_ probably [been] talking _at least_ ten minutes [so [,] um _,] if_ [you] [, um ,] unless [you] [have] [some] [other] [things] [you] want [to] _talk_ [about] [as] having [to do] _with_ p c 
B|71| B: [not] [too] [much] . [what] [kind of [,] what] [kind [of] things do you] write ? 
A|72| A: [well [,] um [,] i] [was a] technical writer [for] [many] [years] [, um ,] 
B|73| B: [oh] 
A|74| A: [and [my] husband] [and i] actually met [in] [a] [computer] [company] . [um [,] i] [was a] tech writer [and] [he] [was] [an] engineer . [and , uh , [so] [i] did] tech _writing_ [for] [a] number [of] [years .] 
B|75| B: _to her_ [go] [talk] [to] daddy [about] [it .] excuse [me .] 
A|76| A: [oh ,] [sure] . 
B|77| B: _to her_ [go] _on and_ [talk] [to] daddy [about] [it] [tell] daddy [i] unplugged [it [for] you [.] but] [you] [don't] _need_ [to] drag [it] [down] [the] hall 
A|78| A: [got] [a] problem , _huh_ ? [um ,] 
B|79| B: daddy , daddy came [home and] found _her_ playing [with the] telephone [that [i] had] unplugged 
A|80| A: [oh .] trying [to] figure _out_ [what] all [that was] [about] , _huh_ ? 
B|81| B: [yeah .] 
A|82| A: [but , um [,] [i] have] [, um [,] [that] [,] that was] [the] majority [of] [my] _writing_ although [, um [,] [i] have] [also] done [oh ,] free lance magazine _writing_ [and] [some] educational _writing_ . [and [,] um ,] [for] [a] while [i [had] a] [, um [,] uh ,] [a] partnership [with] [a] , [in] [an] advertising agency [with] another woman [who is] [a] , [an] artist . [so [i] did some] advertising [and] p r [but ,] 
B|83| B: [huh] . 
A|84| A: [um ,] now [i'm ,] actually [i'm ,] [i'm not] working anymore _. i'm_ [a] student , [i'm] [a] graduate student [so i'm] doing [a] _lot_ [of] _writing_ [but [,] uh ,] now all [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: [i've] done [a] little , [a] _lot_ [of] different kinds [, but] [i , i] [just] _know_ _right_ now [that i] couldn't [have] [put] _out_ half [of] [what] [i did] _if_ [that] [much] without [the] being [in] [computers] [so that's] [been] really great . [and , uh ,] [i'm [,] [so] i'm] real spoiled . 
B|87| B: [yeah [.] i'm] anxious [some] day [to have] one [here .] 
A|88| A: [yeah .] 
B|89| B: [i'm [,] and] [they] [just] talked [to] [the] [other] day [other] day [about] setting something [up] again [so] hopefully pretty soon we'll [at least] [have] [the] [word] processing . 
A|90| A: _uh-huh . yeah ._ 
B|91| B: [my] nine year old [i've] decided [to] teach _her_ [how] [to] type [using] [the computer] , 
A|92| A: good . 
B|93| B: _so ._ 
A|94| A: [that's] great . 
B|95| B: [yeah .] 
A|96| A: [yeah .] 
B|97| B: [i've] , 
A|98| A: [well ,] [those] are skills [that] [she] certainly [is] _going to_ [need] early [on [and] _,] you know_ [, the] [, and] [it] seems like [it's] getting earlier [and] earlier [with the] children . 
B|99| B: [that's] [right .] 
A|100| A: [so [,] um [,] i] think [that that] _would be a_ real , [a] real [, uh ,] advantage [to ,] [to _her] [to_ have] [that] [and , uh ,] [do] [it] early , 
B|101| B: [uh-huh . yeah .] 
A|102| A: [so [.] uh ,] [do] 
B|103| B: [we've] [been] , [we've] [been] [, uh ,] [writing] [a] story together . 
A|104| A: [oh ,] [neat .] 
B|105| B: [and] [so [i] [,] and i] wanted [her to] [put] [it] [into [the] computer] [, and] [then] print [it] [out] [and ,] make [a] book [with] [it [, you] know] . 
A|106| A: _yes ._ [right [.] oh ,] great . 
B|107| B: [and] [so i] decided [well [,] if] she's [going [to] do] [that [,] it] [would be a] whole [lot] easier [if] [she] [could] type 
A|108| A: [right] 
B|109| B: [so] we'll slowly learn [just to] type [here and] [then] [then] [put] [the] story [in] . 
A|110| A: [that's] great . [well [,] that's] [a] [, that's] [a] skill [that] [she] [can] [use] [for the] rest [of] [her] life [, so] might [as] [well] start now , [huh] ? 
B|111| B: [yes] , [yes [.] i] agree . 
A|112| A: [well ,] nola [i have] enjoyed talking [with] [you] thoroughly . this [is] really [going to] [be] fun [i] think , 
B|113| B: [yeah .] 
A|114| A: [and [,] [um ,] my husband] [is] [a] ham radio operator [and i] think [about] all [the] people [that] [he] talks [to] all [over] [the] ,
