8	2	3	i , i	27	66	1	A	4, 27, 35, 49, 54, 57, 59, 69
7	6	3	, i don't	4	57	1	B	1, 4, 11, 13, 27, 51, 57
7	5	3	, i guess	18	72	2	B	3, 9, 18, 43, 46, 49, 74
6	1	3	, it's ,	45	46	1	A	8, 15, 43, 45, 51, 53
6	1	3	it's , it's	8	51	1	B	1, 8, 15, 43, 45, 51
5	3	3	yeah , i	35	62	1	A	14, 35, 40, 59, 75
4	4	3	the , the	35	28	1	A	30, 35, 51, 57
3	3	3	, but i	6	30	1	B	3, 6, 32
3	3	3	, if they	25	8	2	A	18, 24, 25
3	3	3	i don't think	32	22	2	B	11, 27, 32
3	1	3	i think so	75	62	2	A	14, 30, 75
3	1	3	it , it's	27	46	1	A	8, 27, 53
3	1	3	know , that	56	48	2	B	9, 27, 56
2	2	3	, and ,	15	10	1	A	6, 15
2	2	3	, i know	35	6	1	A	30, 35
2	2	3	, i would	54	52	1	B	3, 54
2	2	3	. it ,	9	4	1	A	6, 9
2	2	3	and , and	61	56	1	A	6, 61
2	2	3	going to ,	49	2	1	A	48, 49
2	2	3	i think that	54	28	1	B	27, 54
2	2	3	just really ,	35	6	1	A	30, 35
2	2	3	of it ,	23	16	1	A	8, 23
2	2	3	to , to	48	12	1	B	37, 48
2	2	3	yeah . i	49	46	1	A	4, 49
26	3	2	, i	4	75	2	B	1, 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 23, 25, 27, 30, 35, 40, 41, 43, 45, 46, 49, 51, 54, 57, 59, 69, 74, 75

8	3	2	, if	18	45	2	B	13, 15, 18, 24, 25, 43, 49, 57
8	1	2	i guess	64	72	2	B	3, 9, 18, 43, 46, 49, 64, 74
8	1	2	it's ,	27	53	1	B	1, 8, 15, 27, 43, 45, 51, 53
8	8	2	well ,	15	75	1	A	0, 15, 22, 24, 46, 52, 57, 74
7	7	2	right .	62	63	4	B	7, 9, 19, 33, 62, 67, 69
6	6	2	, that's	66	50	3	B	23, 27, 33, 66, 68, 72
6	3	2	, the	30	43	1	B	15, 30, 35, 45, 51, 57
6	6	2	is ,	64	56	5	B	9, 15, 19, 25, 49, 64
