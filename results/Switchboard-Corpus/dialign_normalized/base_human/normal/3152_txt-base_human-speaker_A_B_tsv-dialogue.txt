B|109| B: [really] ? 
A|110| A: [and , uh [,] it] [kind of] makes me [listen] [a little] closer [to [,] [to] the] piano [when] [i] hear [it] [at] [other] places [, or] [when] [i [,] you know ,] [see] [some ,] [see] [and] hear someone playing [. i] sort [of] watch their technique [, too [,] and , [and] see if] [it] corresponds [up] [to] [what] she's learning . 
B|111| B: [yeah .] 
A|112| A: [so , it's] been fun .
