A|28| A: right . 
B|29| B: [i] mean , [we] , [we] had [a] car once [that] [we] tried [to] [have] declared [a] lemon under [the] lemon law _which_ _is_ extremely difficult _to do_ .

B|35| B: _yeah , yeah_ [it] _, it_ [really] _is_ _, uh _,_ but [,_ gee ,] this _is_ , [of] [all] [the] topics [i] [have] had , i'm doing this thing , this _is_ [kind of] [the] strangest _one_ . 
A|36| A: [i _,] at_ _first_ [i] thought [of] food [, you know _,] because_ [that's] [what] , mainly [what] [i] [buy] [, it] seems [like] [, and _, uh] , you know [,_ i] still [don't [have] any ,] [anything] [to do] [there] [, but [,] but i [, i] _think] [,_ too] [, [a] lot of] _people_ _don't buy_ their warranties [either] _because_ [they] [know] [that] [when] [it's] [that] old they're [going] [to] [buy a] new [one ,] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [so] . 
B|39| B: _well [,_ i think] [that's] true [, and] [i [,] uh ,] now [we] generally [don't [buy] a] warranty [, because] [you] [think [,] you know [,] at] least [for the] [first] [couple of years] , nothing should go wrong with [it] . 
A|40| A: [yeah ,] [my husband] [is] [really] [good] [at] fixing [things [,] too] [, so] he [usually ,] [be] able [to] fix [anything] [that's] minor [, and] _and that_ [has] saved us thousands [of] dollars [, you know ,] [from] [to] mechanic [to] [anything] [like] [that]

B|43| B: [i think] [technology is better] , i'm , i'm [not] [sure [.] [i] think] you've got [a] [good] point with [the] [plastic] [and that] . 
A|44| A: about quality .

A|48| A: [yeah , [yeah] .] 
B|49| B: [and] [i think] [that] certainly [makes] [a] difference [from] , [back] [from] [the] [time] [when] somebody _handcrafted something_ [and [,] you know ,] had [some] pride [in] [it] . 
A|50| A: right . [well ,] _people_ aren't willing [to] pay those prices very [often] [, so] [, you know ,] [for a] [handcrafted [something] [,] so]
