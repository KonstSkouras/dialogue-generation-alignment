A|0| A: okay _on_ _a_ scale _of_ _one_ _to_ _ten_ _where_ do _you_ _stand_ _and_ why ? 
B|1| B: _well_ _i_ guess _i_ [stand] [on] _uh_ [on] _probably_ [ten] _for_ _no_ _uh_ restrictions _. i_ _uh_ recently _just_ _moved_ [to] texas from _uh_ south dakota [and] nebraska _and i_ guess _in_ terms _of gun control_ i've _always_ _uh_ _been_ _raised_ _with _the_ uh_ idea _in the_ constitution _that_ _uh_ citizens had [a] _right_ [to] bear arms _and i_ realize _that_ _probably_ _way_ back _when_ _when_ _the_ constitution _was_ written _it_ _probably_ regarded _uh_ more _uh_ _of a_ national defense _uh_ _than_ anything else _but_ _uh_ _on the_ other hand _too_ _uh_ people _then_ _uh_ needed [to] use firearms _for_ um survival _in_ terms [of] _uh_ food 
A|2| A: yes true . 
B|3| B: [and] _uh_ _i was raised_ _uh_ _you know_ _hunting_ _all_ _the_ time _i_ _lived_ _on the_ farm [and] _uh_ _you know_ enjoy _hunting _and_ i_ guess _i have_ _uh_ _some_ problems _with_ _uh_ _being_ restricted [to] um owning _a gun_ _for_ _you know_ _hunting_ purposes mainly . 
A|4| A: [right] . 
B|5| B: [and] um _it_ scares _me_ [a] little bit [to] _think that_ _they_ _would_ begin restricting _gun control_ _to the_ point [where] um eventually _we_ may _not_ _be_ able [to] _have_ _that_ [right] any more . 
A|6| A: _yeah_ [i] can [i] can understand [that] [. [i] was raised] [in] oklahoma [and] _of course_ [being] oklahoman [and] texan [uh] _yeah_ [the] [hunting and] everything [and i] used [to] _things_ [in] my father [and] my husband having guns [and] _all [and_ _i] i_ did used _to be_ [all] [in] favor [of] [it] [but] it's [all] [of a] sudden it's starting [to] _get_ really scary [with] these gangs . yet _i think_ [i] [would] vote [a] _one_ _if_ [i] thought [that] [it] [would] [be] nation wide [and] [they] can guarantee [no] _one_ _would _have_ [a_ gun] [no] crooks nothing . [but] because [i] [know] _that's_ [not] _going_ [to] happen [then] [i have] [to] [probably] [right] _up_ _there_ about an eight 
B|7| B: [yeah] [it] [uh] moving [to] _this_ area _of course it_ happens everywhere [but] [uh] [i] guess we're pretty naive _coming_ from small towns [uh] _in the_ midwest [and] [then] [uh] moving [to] [a] larger city [where] [there] _are_ drive-by shootings [and] [uh] [there] _seems like_ killing _for_ [no] reason at [all and] [uh] . 
A|8| A: [well] [it] [just] [seems like] [in the] past three or four _years_ [it] has [just] gotten _so_ _much_ worse [than] [it] [was] . _there's always_ [been] [a] certain amount [of] crime [in] your [you know] your urban areas [and i] [know] [we] [lived] [in] chicago [for] seven _years_ [and] [of course it] [was] definitely [there] . _so_ [when] [we] first [moved] here [it] wasn't as _bad_ as [this] . it's [you know] it's [just] getting [all] [of a] sudden _so_ _much_ worse [. i] don't [know] whether it's due [to the] drugs [and] [the uh] drug kings [that] [are] here [and] jamaican drug kings [coming] [in] [. i] don't [know] whether _that's_ [it] or street gangs [. i] don't [know] what [the] answer is [. i] _know that_ it's scary [and] yet [i] hate _the government_ constantly telling [me] what [i] can do [and] what [i] can't do [and] _that's_ basically what [the] [gun control] [would] end _up_ [being] . 
B|9| B: [i [i] think] [so] [and] [and] [there's always] [the uh] [the uh] [the] old [uh] saying [that] keeps [coming] [up] [that] [if] [a] person wants [a gun] [bad] enough they'll they'll [get] [one] [and] [uh] [and] [then] [uh] . 
A|10| A: [well] it's very true . 
B|11| B: [yeah] . 
A|12| A: it's [not] [the] law abiding citizen [that] [you know] is is dangerous [with the] [gun] it's [the] ones [that] _are going_ out [and] stealing [it] . 
B|13| B: [yeah] . 
A|14| A: [and i] said [i think] [the] only [way] [i] [would] [be] _in big_ favor [of gun control] is _if they_ could absolutely guarantee [that] nobody _would have_ them . [and [i] [think] that] [would] almost [have] [to] go [with] armies [too] [. i] mean they'd [have] _to be_ almost world-wide which [we] [know] [would] never ever happen . 
B|15| B: [yeah] [yeah] [that's] [for] sure . 
A|16| A: because even [if] [you] said okay [you know] armed forces could [have] them [some] idiot [would] come out [and] sell [it] [to] somebody [on the] street [to] make [a] quick buck . 
B|17| B: [yeah] [and] [uh] [and] [you know] [uh] [i] suppose [uh] [years] ago [way] back [when] [uh] [when] [uh] [they] had [the] revolutionary war [and] people decided [that] [they] [uh] were fed [up] [with [the] government] [uh] [and] [if they] didn't [have a] [way] [to] [uh] [to] fight back [they] [would have] [been] [in big] trouble . 
A|18| A: [that's] very true very true . who knows [we] maybe want [to] overthrow [the government] 
B|19| B: [well] [the] [way] [things] [are going] . 
A|20| A: [i] [know] [if] somebody doesn't do something . [uh] what about [uh] what do [you] [think] [of] [this] [this] [uh] law [that] they're putting into effect [that] [you] [have] [to] wait x number [of] days before [you] can [uh] carry [the] [gun] or buy [you know] actually purchase [the] [gun] ? 
B|21| B: [well] [you know] [they] introduced [some] [gun control] back [when] [i was] [a] teenager [i] believe [in] terms [of] [uh] every [gun] [you] bought had [to be] licensed [i] believe . 
A|22| A: yes . 
B|23| B: [and] [uh] [you [know] that] didn't bother [me] [uh] [too] [much] [and] [so] [i] guess [it] depends um [if] [there] [are] [some] statistics [that] show [that] [uh] [that] people [uh] commit crimes [on the] spur [of] [the] moment .
