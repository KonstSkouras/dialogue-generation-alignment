A|3| A: [detroit] ? 
B|4| B: _yeah ._ 
A|5| A: _is_ [that] _a nice_ vacation _spot_ ? 
B|6| B: _well _it_ wasn't_ _really_ _. it was_ _um_ _uh_ _to see_ an old relative . 
A|7| A: right [okay .] 
B|8| B: _and it was_ _uh_ _just_ _to_ _uh_ [have] _some_ fellowship _with_ her . 
A|9| A: right . _so you_ _probably_ wouldn't recommend [that] as _a_ big _tourist spot_ ? 
B|10| B: _no_ . _the only_ _thing_ [that] _i i_ visited _that _you_ know_ [is] quite [a] [tourist spot] [is] cancun _mexico_ . 
A|11| A: ooh [that] would be _nice ._ 
B|12| B: _and that was_ _real_ [nice .] _uh_ 
A|13| A: _did you_ scuba dive _there_ ? 
B|14| B: _no_ _we_ _just kind of_ walked _the_ beaches _and_ looked _at_ _all the_ beautiful scenery _there ._ 
A|15| A: ooh [that] would be [nice .] 
B|16| B: _yeah_ _and_ _just kind of_ relaxed _and_ unwound _a little bit_ _from_ our daily routine . 
A|17| A: _oh_ [that] would be enjoyable . right [yeah] _that's a nice_ break . 
B|18| B: huh . 
A|19| A: [i] haven't _been_ on vacation _in_ [a] while either . [um] usually _when we_ _go_ [we] _go_ [to] _colorado_ [to] estes park area . which [is] _up_ [kind of] near denver . _and uh_ stay _in_ [the] mountains _up_ [there] _do_ [a little] hiking [and] resting _get away from_ [the] texas heat [that] [kind of] _thing ._ 
B|20| B: _uh-huh ._ yes . [oh] [that's] always refreshing _to [get_ away from] . 
A|21| A: _so_ _it's _a_ lot of_ fun _. i_ worked _up_ [there] [last] summer _so_ _i guess_ [it was] [kind of] like [a] vacation [the] _whole_ summer long 
B|22| B: [oh] _well _that's_ nice ._ _yeah ._ 
A|23| A: worked [at] [a] camp [there] [and] _so_ [i] got [to] spend _a lot of_ _time_ _up_ _in_ [the] mountains . _so_ [that's] _probably_ [my] favorite _place_ _when_ [i] [have] [to] _go_ somewhere on [a] vacation . 
B|24| B: _well_ [my] [uh] [my] middle daughter [and] her husband [have] _just_ taken [up] [a] new activity _and that's_ canoeing . 
A|25| A: [oh] . 
B|26| B: [and uh] they've _been to_ [the] guadalupe _river_ _and they_ also [uh] [uh] [have] _been to_ [uh] [i guess] [colorado] [and] they've _really enjoyed_ [it] . 
A|27| A: [that's nice .] [we] [um] [we] canoed [up] _in_ arkansas [at] [the] buffalo [river] . 
B|28| B: [it's _a] whole_ new _uh-huh ._ 
A|29| A: [and that's] [the] best _place_ [that] i've ever canoed . 
B|30| B: huh . 
A|31| A: [it's] [really] [really] pretty _. i_ [was] [a little] kid then [and] [we] [to] [have] [uh] [we] stayed [at] [some] park [and they] _had [a_ little] [uh] mountain man who came down [the] [river] every night [and] he would give [a little] talk _about_ mountain things . [you know] _i think_ he [wasn't] [a] [real] mountain man _but_ [we] were pretty convinced he [was] [a] full hermit who _lived_ [up] _in_ [the] woods [that] he'd come _in_ his [little] log boat down [the] [river] 
B|32| B: sure . _uh-huh ._ 
A|33| A: [and] [we] would [have] [to] we'd [and] he'd make sassafras tea _out_ [of] sassafras roots [that] he'd found [and _that's] a_ _good_ family _place_ [to] _go_ 
B|34| B: [oh] [that's] _neat_ . sure . 
A|35| A: [and] then [the] [river] [was] [really] [nice] _because_ [it wasn't] _too_ frightening _but_ [it wasn't] [you know] _too_ easy either . 
B|36| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|37| A: [it was] like 
B|38| B: _well_ [you] learn [a lot of] [um] skills [too] _and [i_ think] _you're_ more receptive [when] _you're_ younger than [when] _you're_ older [to] learn new skills 
A|39| A: [that's] true . 
B|40| B: _and [i_ think] [they] [really] [it] [really] penetrates [in] your memory [you _know] what_ [to] [do] [because] [you] [really] _have _a_ great_ interest [in] [it] . _because it's_ something [you] weren't forced [to] [do] 
A|41| A: [uh-huh .] right . 
B|42| B: [so you] [have] [kind _of] a_ relaxed mode [of] learning . 
A|43| A: [yeah .] 
B|44| B: [and] _you're_ more receptive . 
A|45| A: [well that's] _good _._ well_ [we] [um] let's [see] [the only] other _place_ i've ever vacationed we'd [you know] _go_ on camping trips [up] [to] texoma [and] things like _that ._ 
B|46| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: [and] then [i] went _to england_ _a few_ _years_ ago . 
B|48| B: [oh] [that's] exciting . 
A|49| A: [i] [was] [a] student [there] [and] spent [um] [a] semester studying abroad [in] london . 
B|50| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|51| A: [and that was] [a great] _time_ [because it's] [so] [that's] such [a] [neat] _place_ [and] [it's] _there's_ _not_ [a] language barrier [so you] don't [i] mean [there] _there's [a_ little bit] [because] _there's_ [some] [of] those english words [that you] [just] don't exactly [know what] [they] mean [and] [a lot of] people [have] trouble wrestling [with] _their_ accents _but_ [it's] [it was] [really] fun _. [i_ [i] i] [really enjoyed] _that ._ i'm _probably_ going _back_ _there to_ work _for_ [a] [year] . 
B|52| B: [uh-huh [.] well] _i had a friend_ [that] [uh] visited [england] [not] [well] [i think] [it's] [been] [probably] two [years] now [but] [that's] her _next_ goal [and] she _can_ [do] [it] [is] _go back_ [to england] [because] she [really] has [a great] desire [to] [do] [that] [because] [the] _love_ [that] she [um] has [for] [it] now after visiting [it] . 
A|53| A: [it] [it's] [really] [nice _.] i_ would [i] would spend [all] [my] _time_ [in] london or [most] [of] [my] _time_ 
B|54| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|55| A: [and that's] [it was] [really] different being [in] [a] big city [because] [i] don't [get] much into urban [you know] [really] urban areas [a lot] 
B|56| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
A|57| A: [and it was] [it's] [really] [it's] sort [of a] weird [little] anonymous feeling where [no] one _knows_ who [you] are [and] [you] [can] spend [a whole] day without _talking_ [to] anyone which [i] thought [i] would [just] hate [but] [it] ended [up] being [kind of] [nice] [because] [you're] [not] accountable [to] anyone . 
B|58| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
A|59| A: [you] could [just kind of] [kind of] walk _around_ [and] observe 
B|60| B: [do] your own [thing .] [yeah .] 
A|61| A: [i] _did_ [a lot of] [just] going _out_ by myself [and] riding on [the] subway [and] watching people . 
B|62| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [and [i] had [a] great] _time_ doing _that [._ it was] [really] interesting . 
B|64| B: [that's] wonderful _. [there's_ [a] lot] [out] [there _to] see_ 
A|65| A: [yeah] [i] [know] 
B|66| B: i'll _say_ . 
A|67| A: [i] keep wanting [to get] [up] [to] [i] haven't [i] haven't [been] anywhere else outside [the] united states _. i_ haven't [been to] [mexico] or _canada_ or 
B|68| B: [well] [i] [lived] across [the] street almost [from] [canada] 
A|69| A: [oh] . 
B|70| B: [so] [that was] [that] [that's a nice] [place] . [canada] [is] _very_ [nice .] 
A|71| A: [yeah] [that] would be [nice _.] [i_ had a friend] [from] [there .] 
B|72| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|73| A: then [i] i'd [love] [to] [go] somewhere [in] asia [but] i'd [have] [to] [have a] tour guide [with] me [to] help [with] [all the] language [and] [all] _that ._ 
B|74| B: [oh] yes absolutely . sure somebody [that] [knows] [their] way [around] . 
A|75| A: [so] [yeah] _that's why_ _that's why_ [england] _was [nice_ .] even [we] traveled [in] europe [for] _about_ [a] week [and that was] even [nice] [because] [there] [wasn't] [uh] [the] [most] [the] _places_ [we] went [we] went [to] germany [and] switzerland [and] 
B|76| B: [well] you've [been] quite [a few] [places] [there] 
A|77| A: [yeah] [we] [have] . [we] . [we] _did_ [we] whirlwinded through europe . 
B|78| B: once [you] [think] [about] [it] huh . [uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: [it was] [just] insane twelve days where we'd [just] stop like [a] city [a] day [and] [you] slept on [the] train [at] night . 
B|80| B: [oh] [that's] [great] . 
A|81| A: [but] [there] [wasn't] [a] [it was] strange [it was] [kind of] sad [there] [wasn't] ever [a] language problem [there] [because] everyone [in] germany knew english [and] everyone [in] switzerland knew english . 
B|82| B: [uh-huh _.] that's_ [great] . 
A|83| A: [so] [we] were [kind of] pitiful . [we] found one restaurant [we] were [in] [and] got seated [and] then [no] one knew english [in] [there] [and] [we] were [just] finally [had] [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking [up] things . 
B|84| B: [uh-huh] 
A|85| A: [but] [it was] 
B|86| B: [what] [did you] wind [up] [with] ? 
A|87| A: [oh] [i had] fondue . [that was] easy [to] [say] 
B|88| B: [oh] [okay] 
A|89| A: tried [to get] fondue [and] white wine [and that was] 
B|90| B: [uh] [uh-huh .] 
A|91| A: [we] were able [to] [have] [that] pretty pretty effortlessly . [there] were [some] people [at] [the] [next] table who spoke english [so] [we] elicited [their] aid [for] [a] while 
B|92| B: [they] [kind of] guided _you ._ 
A|93| A: [and they] were [very] helpful 
B|94| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [so] [it was] [it was] [a] pleasant _time_ . 
B|96| B: [well] [good .] 
A|97| A: i'd i'd [love] [to] [go back] [there [.] there's] [just] [not] _time_ [there's] [not] enough _time_ [to] [go] [see] everything [and] then [to] afford [to see] everything . 
B|98| B: [i guess] [that's why] [we] need [to] plan [for] retirement [so] [when we] [do] [have] [the] free [time] we'll [have] [the] [the] means [to] [uh] pursue our dreams . 
A|99| A: right [. that's] 
B|100| B: [yeah [.] [i] guess] [that's] [what] retirement [is] [all] [about] . 
A|101| A: [that] [and] sleeping late 
B|102| B: yes . 
A|103| A: [i] keep hoping [for] . 
B|104| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: _well it was nice talking with [you_ .] 
B|106| B: [i] understand [that [.] [well] it was nice talking with you] [too] craig . 
A|107| A: [and] [have a] [good] afternoon . 
B|108| B: [you] [do] [the] same . 
A|109| A: [okay .] 
B|110| B: thank [you .] 
A|111| A: good-bye .
