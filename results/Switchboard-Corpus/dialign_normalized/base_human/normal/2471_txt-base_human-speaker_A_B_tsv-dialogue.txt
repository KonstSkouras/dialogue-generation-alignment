B|25| B: if [we] [can] cut [back] [the] usage , [then] [uh ,] maybe [it] _will_ [have to] _go_ someplace [else] . 
A|26| A: [and] [i think] [it's] [really] [very] sad [that] north [of the] border [, you know ,] [the] united states [and] canada [is so] different , from [the] from south america [, and] central america .
