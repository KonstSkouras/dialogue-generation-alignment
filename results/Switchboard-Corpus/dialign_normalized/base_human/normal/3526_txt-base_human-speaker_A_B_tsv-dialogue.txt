B|54| B: _right_ it's it's it's [just] south [of] [there .] 
A|55| A: _yeah ._ 
B|56| B: it's [a] little place looks [like] [a] castle . 
A|57| A: _yeah ._ 
B|58| B: [kind of uh] little guy [in [there] .] he he [uh] gives reasonable _prices_ . 
A|59| A: [oh] . 
B|60| B: [like] [i i] traded [my] [uh] _three eighty-six_ _for the_ four [eighty-six] [for] [about] six hundred . 
A|61| A: really ? [well] [that's] _a good_ deal . 
B|62| B: [yeah] [it] _was_ pretty reasonable .

B|64| B: [but] [uh uh] he [and] he does [a good] job [and] he he he [uh] guarantees everything he sells . 
A|65| A: [uh] [there is a] lot [you] ever _go_ by lucky [computer] [there] ? 
B|66| B: [uh-huh] [yeah .] 
A|67| A: [i] used [to] _when_ _i was_ putting shop _floor_ [computers] together [for] guys i'd _go_ [and] _get_ their units [and put] them together [and] _go_ [and] interface [the] [stuff] _with_ our systems . 
B|68| B: [uh-huh] . 
A|69| A: haven't been _doing_ much [of] [that] [for the] last year [or] so . so [i i] don't [know where] those guys are at these days . [but] [i] 
B|70| B: [uh] [they] they're [up] [there] [in] [that] mall [. uh] [just] below campbell . [or] [that] strip strip center .

A|73| A: [i] tell [you] those [prices] [have] [just] unbelievably come down . 
B|74| B: [uh-huh] [oh _yeah] i was_ amazed [i was] able [to] [get this] four [eighty-six] [for] six hundred even [with] [a] trade [in] [you] [know] it's [like] wow 
A|75| A: [yeah .] 
B|76| B: [that] works _i'll_ [go] [do] [that] 
A|77| A: [i] 
B|78| B: [and] boy [that] thing screams now . 
A|79| A: [yeah i [was] kind of] surprised how rapidly [they] bypassed _the three [eighty-six_ .] [that] wasn't alive [for] [but] maybe two years . 
B|80| B: [uh-huh] [. [well] i] thought [was] funny [that] [they] kept pushing [the three eighty-six] [s] x even though [the] [the] price difference [is] [about] ten dollars . 
A|81| A: [is] [that] [right] ? [that's] [it] ? 
B|82| B: [yeah] [it] [when] [it] comes [on] [the] manufacturing [floor] it's [about] ten bucks . 
A|83| A: [i'll] be darned .
