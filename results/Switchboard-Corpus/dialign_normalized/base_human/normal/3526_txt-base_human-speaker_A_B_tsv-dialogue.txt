B|78| B: [and] boy [that] thing screams now . 
A|79| A: [yeah , i [was] kind of] surprised how rapidly [they] bypassed [, _the] three [eighty-six_ .] [that] wasn't alive [for] [but] maybe two years . 
B|80| B: [uh-huh] [. [well ,] i] thought [was] funny [that] [they] kept pushing [the three eighty-six] [s] x even though [the [,] the] price difference [is] [about] ten dollars . 
A|81| A: [is] [that] [right] ? [that's] [it] ? 
B|82| B: [yeah ,] [it] [, when] [it] comes [on] [the] manufacturing [floor] it's [about] ten bucks .
