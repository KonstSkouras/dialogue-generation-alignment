B|2| B: _oh_ [i] _do_ _too_ 
A|3| A: _but i_ don't _like_ getting [too] awfully fancy _about_ _it_ _just because_ _um_ _uh_ _it's_ [too] _much_ pressure . _you know_ 
B|4| B: _uh-huh _. uh-huh_ ._ 
A|5| A: _if i_ [have] _people over_ _for_ _dinner_ _i like it_ _to_ _be_ nice _and_ relaxed . 
B|6| B: _yeah you_ _can't_ enjoy _it ._ right . 
A|7| A: _yeah ._ _and_ _so_ [i] don't _like_ _to_ arrive _or_ _or_ _when_ _they_ arrive _for me_ _to_ _be_ completely worn _out_ . 
B|8| B: _that's_ _that's_ _what_ [i like] doing things [like] making lasagna [just because] [i] _can_ [have] [it] ready [and] baking _in the oven_ 
A|9| A: _yeah ._ 
B|10| B: [it's] 
A|11| A: exactly . 
B|12| B: everybody [just] says how wonderful [it] _is_ _and _it's_ it's_ [like] [uh] yes 
A|13| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|14| B: [i] . 
A|15| A: _yeah ._ 
B|16| B: _that's_ _one of_ those things [i] got famous [for] _in_ college . [people] would come [and] say could would [you] come _over and_ _make_ lasagna [for me] 
A|17| A: [uh-huh] 
B|18| B: [it's] [like] [well _i] can't_ _really_ give [you] _a_ _recipe_ [uh] 
A|19| A: [uh-huh] you'd _just do [it_ .] 
B|20| B: [i] _can_ [i] _can_ [just do it] 
A|21| A:  . 
B|22| B: [i like] doing _that_ kind _of_ _stuff_ . 
A|23| A: _yeah ._ 
B|24| B: _and _it's_ it's_ _fun_ _in_ fact _that's_ _what_ we had [for] _a_ christmas party last week . 
A|25| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|26| B: we [just] had _a_ bunch _of_ [people _over] and_ we had we did lasagna [and] garlic bread [and] [uh] yummy . 
A|27| A: _um ._ boy [i like] [that] . 
B|28| B: [uh] [i] [do] [too] _in_ fact 
A|29| A: [yeah] [well] _i'm_ _planning_ [a] [and] naturally _this is_ appropriate _because i'm_ _planning_ _dinner_ [for] [people] tomorrow night _and then_ [the] next night . 
B|30| B: _oh_ . _oh_ _good ._ 
A|31| A: _so_ tuesday night there'll _be_ eight [people] here altogether . 
B|32| B: [uh] actually _one_ thing we [have] _done_ quite [a] _bit_ through [the] holidays [just _because] it's_ [a] real _easy_ [is] [just] baked potato dinners . 
A|33| A: _oh yeah_ [uh-huh .] 
B|34| B: [and] [have] [you know] [like] _three_ [or] four couples come _over and_ _i'll_ [do] [the] potatoes _and [you_ know] [like] butter [and] cheese [and] _stuff_ [and] [have] everybody else [just] _bring_ [a] couple _of_ toppings whatever [they] [like] 
A|35| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|36| B: _and it_ turns [out] great [because] [i] mean you've got [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue _and [you_ know] bacon [and] all [that] _good_ _stuff_ . 
A|37| A: [yeah] [that's] [fun] [. uh-huh .] 
B|38| B: [but] _it's it's_ inexpensive 
A|39| A: _yeah ._ 
B|40| B: plus [it's] real _easy_ _on_ [the] hostess [because] _you can_ [just] [have] [the] potatoes ready [and] [just] _have a_ salad _with it_ _and you_ got [a] great [dinner] . 
A|41| A: [yeah] [that's] [a] [good] idea . 
B|42| B: _it's it's_ real _easy_ [i like] doing [that] part . 
A|43| A: _yeah ._ 
B|44| B: [i'm] _in_ favor _of_ _very_ _little_ clean _up_ [um] _very_ _little_ [planning] [because] we've got _three_ [or] four couples [that] we _get_ together _with_ [to] play games 
A|45| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh] _yeah ._ 
B|46| B: _and it's_ 
A|47| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|48| B: we invariably end _up_ at _my_ house since _i've_ got _two_ kids . 
A|49| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|50| B: [and] [that] _it's it's_ fine [because] [then] [i] _can_ [just] say [okay] fine [you] _bring_ [this] [you] _bring_ [this] [you] _bring_ [this] we're _done_ . 
A|51| A: _yeah ._ 
B|52| B: _and it's_ pretty cool . 
A|53| A: [yeah] [that's] [good .] [well] [one of] [my] favorites _if i_ don't _want to_ [have] other [people] [bring] [stuff] [i] [just] _want to_ treat them [is] [to] [make] _chicken_ [and] _rice ._ 
B|54| B: [uh-huh .] [oh] . 
A|55| A: [it's] [very] [easy] [to] . 
B|56| B: [oh] . 
A|57| A: [you] don't _like _it_ ?_ 
B|58| B: [oh] [i] love [it] 
A|59| A: [oh] [you] [do] [okay] _yeah _._ i_ [have a] [really] [easy] [recipe] [for] [that] _where _you_ just brown the chicken_ _and then_ _you put_ _rice_ [in the] bottom _of the_ _pan_ [you] pour _bouillon_ [or] _chicken_ broth [over] [it] 
B|60| B: [um .] 
A|61| A: [and] [and _you] put_ _the chicken_ [in] [then] pour [the] [uh] broth [over [and] [you] can] _put_ mushrooms [in] _if you want_ _and then_ _you just_ . 
B|62| B: [over] [the] _uncooked rice_ ? 
A|63| A: [yeah] [over] [uncooked rice] 
B|64| B: [oh] . 
A|65| A: [and [you] can] either _microwave_ [it] _or [do_ it] [in the oven] [and it] [just] . 
B|66| B: [oh] how neat . 
A|67| A: [it] fluffs [up] [and it's] [really] moist . 
B|68| B: huh . now _i've done it_ _with_ [where [you] put] [you] [cook] [the] [well i] guess [you] probably could [do it] same way [but] [cook] _the rice_ [and then] take [a] [can] [of] [like] cream [of] mushroom soup [or] cream [of] [chicken] soup [and] [put] _a little bit_ [of] white wine [in] [it .] 
A|69| A: [uh-huh] wow _yeah ._ 
B|70| B: [and] every once [in] [a] while _i'll_ _put in_ _i'll_ slice white grapes [and] _i'll_ _put in_ _there_ [and] [that's] [just [because] i'm] _not_ [a] real big wine person [but [i] like it] [it] adds something [to] [the chicken] . 
A|71| A: [uh-huh .] _yeah ._ 
B|72| B: [and then] [just] bake [it] [and it] makes [a] wonderful sauce [over] _the [rice_ .] 
A|73| A: [well] [i'll] keep [that] [one] [in] mind . 
B|74| B: [yeah] 
A|75| A: _yeah ._ 
B|76| B: [it's] [that] _was_ [one [of] the] first things [i] made [for] [my] husband [because] [i] _was_ [like] [um] [yeah] 
A|77| A: _yeah ._ 
B|78| B: [i] could actually find something [i] could [cook] real [easy] [that] would [be] kind [of] sort [of] elegant kind [of] 
A|79| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah [you] _can] get_ away [with it] even having [a] semi nice [dinner] 
B|80| B: [oh [yeah] .] 
A|81| A: [or] [you know] semi . 
B|82| B: [but] [then] [i] hadn't thought [about] doing [it] [with] [uncooked [rice] .] 
A|83| A: [yeah .] 
B|84| B: [so] [just] [like] [in] [a] thirteen by nine [pan] . 
A|85| A: [yeah .] [you [put] in] [um] 
B|86| B: [um .] 
A|87| A: let's see [what] [was] [it] [three] quarters [of] cup [of] [rice] [or] 
B|88| B: [um .] 
A|89| A: [it] depends [on] [you can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|90| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|91| A: [but] _you have to_ [put] [the] water [in] proportionally _. [i_ can't] remember _. i_ think [it] [was] [three] quarters cup [rice] [to] [two] cups water [two] cups [um] broth . 
B|92| B: [yeah] _yeah i_ [i] use [that] [for] [for] [rice] [and] [for] [when] [i] [cook] pasta [or] something [i'll] [put] _a little bit_ [of] [bouillon] [in] _there_ [just] [to] give [it] _a little_ extra _flavor ._ 
A|93| A: [yeah] [flavor [.] uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|94| B: [um .] now [that] would [be] [good .] 
A|95| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|96| B: how long [do] [you have to] bake [it ?] 
A|97| A: [um] let's see _. i_ think [it] [was] _an_ hour . [i've done it] _in the microwave_ [so] often lately [because [it's] it's] [really] [easy] . 
B|98| B: [i] [do] [i] [do] [microwave] [too] [a] lot 
A|99| A: [yeah .] [but i] think [it's] [about] _an_ hour . 
B|100| B: how long would [it] [be] how long would [it] [be] [in the microwave] ? 
A|101| A: [or] maybe [it's] only half hour . [um] _you just_ until [the rice] looks fluffy [and] [and] [not] overdone . [you know] before [it] gets overdone . 
B|102| B: [oh] [okay .] [okay .] [do] [you just brown the chicken] [to] [get] [it] colored 
A|103| A: [yeah .] 
B|104| B: [or do] [you] go ahead [and] _let it cook_ through ? 
A|105| A: [um] i'd [let it cook] [just] [a little bit] [just] [so] [that] [the] cooking _goes_ [a little] faster . 
B|106| B: [um .] ooh [this is] [a] beneficial call [. [i] like] [this] 
A|107| A: [yeah i] liked your idea [too] [there] . 
B|108| B: [yeah] [but] [that] one's [an] [easy] [one] . [it's] [like] [just] [put in] [a] friend [of] mine makes [it] [where] she [goes] ahead [and] seasons [up] [the] [with] [the] soup [and] [the] wine 
A|109| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|110| B: [put in] garlic [and] onion powder [or] chopped onions [if you [want] to] [do] [that] [you know] . [what] ever however [much] effort [you] feel [like] putting into [it .] 
A|111| A: [yeah [.] uh-huh .] 
B|112| B: [but] [it] [it] makes [a] great [i] mean [i've] got [a] [two] year old [and] [a] four year old [and] [they] love [it .] 
A|113| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|114| B: [and] [because] [my] daughter calls [it] her gravy [and] [i] mean she thinks [it's] wonderful [my] [good] you're [a] picky eater [if i] [can get] [you] [to]
