A|0| A: _okay _,_ uh ,_ _what_ kind _of_ hobbies _do you_ _have_ lori ? 
B|1| B: _uh _, i_ guess_ _, i_ _, uh , _i_ like_ _to _play_ golf_ . 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _and _, uh ,_ i_ also _like_ _to_ _plant_ _flowers_ _and_ [do] [do] _some_ gardening _and_ [do] arts _and_ crafts . 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ _where_ _do you_ [play golf] _in_ _this_ _area_ ? 
B|5| B: _well _,_ we_ _live , uh ,_ pretty _close_ , _to the_ mesquite _golf course ._ 
A|6| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: _so _,_ we_ _will_ [play] either _out_ _there_ _or_ _at_ _firewheel_ . _that is_ usually [where] _we_ [play] _, _but i_ have_ _played_ _you know_ different courses [in] _in the_ dallas [area] . 
A|8| A: _do you_ [, uh _,] do you_ _ride_ [or] _do you_ _pull_ _a cart_ _when_ [you] [play golf] ? 
B|9| B: [uh ,] both 
A|10| A: _oh_ . 
B|11| B: _not_ _at the_ same _time ._ 
A|12| A: [i] _was_ _going to_ say , [that] could _be_ difficult 
B|13| B: no , sometimes _we_ [ride] _and_ sometimes [, uh _,] we_ , [pull] _, we_ _like_ [to] , [to] _, uh , a_ lot [of] _the_ times _just_ walk [, uh ,] _for_ _the_ exercise . _but_ 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [i] find [that] _when i_ [ride] _in [a_ cart] _, i_ [play] better _and_ _i think_ _it is_ _cause_ _i don't_ _get_ _as_ tired 
A|16| A: [i think] [that] might _be_ true . 
B|17| B: yeah . 
A|18| A: [i don't] [like] pulling [a cart] _on_ firewell [golf course] _because_ _they_ want [you] [to] [pull] [the] [cart] _on the_ path . 
B|19| B: [i] _know _,_ _and_ that_ makes me _so_ mad _you know ,_ _it is_ [like] _it is_ _not_ [going to] [do] [that] _much_ damage _to _the_ course , but_ apparently [they] [think] differently 
A|20| A: [that is] _the reason_ [, [i] don't] _play over there_ . 
B|21| B: yeah . 
A|22| A: [i like] [the course [, but] [i] don't] _play over there_ _because_ _, you_ _, they_ [don't] _, uh , you know_ [don't] allow [you] [to] [pull] [a cart] . 
B|23| B: _right ._ 
A|24| A: [and [,] [i] don't] [think] [a cart] damages [the] turf . 
B|25| B: _right ._ _well ,_ [the reason] why _we_ [play over there] [is] [because] its [where] , since _we_ _are_ [a] _garland_ resident [, they] gave us _a special_ deal [where] [you] can _get_ [, uh ,] ten rounds [of] [golf] _for_ [a] hundred dollars , yeah _, a_ hundred dollars _cause_ _it is_ half price [what] [the] normal green fees _are_ . 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _so_ [that is] why _we_ [you know] [play over there] _cause_ _we have_ got our _card_ 
A|28| A: [well [,] i guess] [i] could use [a] [card] _too_ _. i_ [live , uh ,] very near [, uh ,] very [close] [to the] [firewheel] [golf course .] 
B|29| B: [oh] [, do you] ? _so you_ _live in_ _garland_ _then_ . 
A|30| A: yes [, i] [live in] northwest [garland] _. right_ _up_ [there] near [the] [golf course .] 
B|31| B: [okay ,] [well] _we_ _are_ [in] south [garland] [, but] yeah , next _time_ [you] _go_ _, uh , you know ,_ check into _it [,_ _they] _have_ , uh ,_ _it is_ _just_ [like] _, uh , a_ bus [card] _and they_ _just_ punch _it_ . _you know ,_ _it_ has got _one_ _through_ ten [on] _it_ [and] every _time_ [you] _go_ [they] _just_ punch _it_ _for_ [you] . 
A|32| A: [well ,] [in the] _last_ two years _, i have_ [not] [played] very [much] [golf] [because] [i] am involved [in] boy scouts . 
B|33| B: [oh] , [okay] . 
A|34| A: [so _,] i [have_ [, uh _,] i] [have_ [, uh _,] i] have_ children boy scout age . 
B|35| B: [you] must [have] [a] _, a_ son . 
A|36| A: [i have] two boys [that] [are] boy scout age [, [and] , uh ,] [so] [i] am very active [in] boy scouts 
B|37| B: [oh] , [okay] . 
A|38| A: [so] [i] would [have] [to] say [that] camping [and] hiking [and] canoeing [and] boy scouts [is] my hobby . 
B|39| B: yeah . 
A|40| A: [but i] 
B|41| B: [oh] [well] [that] sounds [like] _fun_ [too] 
A|42| A: [but] my [golf] clubs [will] _probably_ rust _before_ [i] [get] [to] use _them_ again [because] my boys [are] still [right] [at the] beginning age _and [it_ is] _probably_ [going _to] be_ six [to] eight years _before_ [they] [go] [to] college . 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] [well [,] you] need [to] [, uh ,] teach [them] how _to play_ [and] take [them] _out_ [on [the] course] _with_ [you] 
A|44| A: that's [right .] lessons [are] expensive though . 
B|45| B: [oh] , yeah . [well] [you] can teach [them] 
A|46| A: [well [,] they] would _probably_ never _make it_ [then] [because] [i don't] [think] [, uh , i] only took lessons [for] [golf] [when i] _was_ [in] college . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [uh ,] [as] [a] [course] [for] p e [you know] [so] [i] could graduate . 
B|49| B: [right] , [right .] [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [but] [, uh ,] [that is] [the] only [time] [i think] [i have] ever _really_ taken [golf] lessons [and that] _was_ kind [of] [a] group scenario [and] [not] individual . 
B|51| B: [uh-huh [.] [right] [.] [right] .] 
A|52| A: [i] took [one] lesson [one] other [time .] besides [that] [, uh , _i] _just_ [,_ uh ,] _try to_ _make_ [the] club hit [the] ball . 
B|53| B: [right .] yeah [, i] [know] [what] [you] mean 
A|54| A: [i don't] want [to play] strike [out] [, you know] . 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [but i have] [fun] doing [it ,] [some] [, uh , you know _,] i have_ [some] _good_ shots [and] [some] bad shots . 
B|57| B: [oh] yeah . [it ,] [it is] [just] nice [to] [get] outdoors [and] [do] something . 
A|58| A: [so you] said [you] work [, uh ,] [in the] _gardens_ [too] . [do you] [have [, uh ,] [a] special] [flowers] ? 
B|59| B: [well] flower [gardens] [. [i] like] [to] [have ,] matter [of] fact [this] past weekend [i just] got finished planting _a bunch of_ tulips [and] daffodil bulbs . [so ,] those ought [to be] coming [up] around spring [time] 
A|60| A: my wife _had , uh ,_ [just] _put_ [in [a] bunch of] [, i] want [to] say _, they are_ _pansies_ . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: she _put them_ [in] [like] two months ago _cause _they_ are_ _winter_ plants . 
B|63| B: [right .] 
A|64| A: [and [they] have] been [, we] thought _even_ [with] all [the] cold _weather_ _weather_ [we have] _had_ [they have] been blooming [just] fine . 
B|65| B: [oh] [, they] [do] great [. i] [put] mine [in] [probably] [in] november . 
A|66| A: [that is] [when] she did _, i think_ . 
B|67| B: yeah [, i think] [it] [was] november [and] [i don't] [do] anything [to] mine , water [them] [or] anything [and they] [just [,] they] [do] [really] [good] [and] [i] [even] [had [, uh [,] i] guess] [it] [was] [last] year [or] [the] year [before] [, i] [had] [some] [out] [and it] froze [and] [the] [pansies] looked terrible [, but] [they] came back later [. i] didn't [do] anything [to] [them] [so] [they are] [, uh [,] they are] [good] [to] _plant_ _in the winter [time_ .] [they] [last] [for] [a] long [time] [then] . [so ,] _if you_ start putting [them] [, you know [,] you] can [put them] [out] [in the] spring [too] [, but] once [it] starts getting real hot [then] [it] [just] kills [them] [cause they] can't stand [the] hot [weather] . 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] [do] [they] survive longer [if you] [plant] [them] [in the winter time] ? [will] _they _make it through_ the summer_ sun ? 
B|69| B: no [, they] won't [make it through the summer] [because] [it] gets [too] hot [, but] [they make it through] [probably] [winter] [and] spring . [so ,] 
A|70| A: [well] . 
B|71| B: yeah [, i have] got [some] [of] those [too] , [cause] [i] love [flowers] 
A|72| A: [well ,] [that is] [good] . 
B|73| B: yeah . [and] [i] [do] [, i] [try to] [do] [some] arts [and] crafts [and] [i] love [to] [go] ,
