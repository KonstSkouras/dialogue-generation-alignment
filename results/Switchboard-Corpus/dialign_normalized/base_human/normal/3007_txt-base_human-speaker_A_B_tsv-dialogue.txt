A|0| A: _okay_ _do you_ _have_ _any_ pets ? 
B|1| B: _yes i've_ _had_ _i_ [have] _had a_ number _of them_ in _my_ lifetime _and_ _i've_ _i_ am _a golden retriever_ fan 
A|2| A: _oh_ . 
B|3| B: _but_ _i had_ _to_ replace _it_ _with_ _something_ _that_ _the_ _kids_ could carry . 
A|4| A: _oh_ 
B|5| B: _yes_ . _yes_ . 
A|6| A: instead [of] being carried 
B|7| B: _yes_ _well_ _they_ _were_ _they_ _really_ wanted _something_ teeny tiny _and i_ _uh_ _really_ wanted _that_ retriever's disposition . _uh_ _the_ ultimate _to_ tolerant trainable disposition 
A|8| A: _yeah ._ [really] . 
B|9| B: so _i_ called _four_ or five _dog_ trainers _because_ _i_ don't _like_ _the_ _little_ _dogs_ . 
A|10| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: _and_ _and i_ asked _them_ [you] know these _are_ _the_ ages _of the_ _kids_ what [do] _i_ _get_ _. and_ _they_ _all_ said _golden retriever _and_ i_ said [okay] put _it_ under twenty _pounds _._ _and_ the_ only thing _that_ _they_ could come _up_ _with_ _was a_ bichon frize _which_ _is_ _a_ 
A|12| A: huh . 
B|13| B: [do you] know what _that_ _is_ ? 
A|14| A: [yes _i've] seen_ _those_ _. _they're_ cute ._ 
B|15| B: [they're cute _.] they_ look _like_ an air headed let me tell [you] [. they're] calm [they're] _not_ yuppie [they're] trainable [they're] _uh_ _very_ personable in _a_ different way _that_ _a golden retriever_ _is_ [. they're] _not_ dignified _like a_ _retriever_ can be . 
A|16| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: [yeah .] so how old _is_ your _retriever_ ? 
A|18| A: _oh_ _she's_ _about_ [four] . _she's_ [not] completely _pure_ . _we_ got her _from_ _the uh_ humane society _when_ she [was a] puppy . she looks [like a] she looks _just like [a_ golden retriever] [but] _she's_ [a] [little] bit smaller . _she's_ [like] _fifty-five_ [pounds .] 
B|19| B: _well_ actually [you] know that's [the] breed standard for females . what [you] 
A|20| A: [is] [it] ? 
B|21| B: [yeah] what [you] see shown _and_ bred now as [golden] retrievers _this_ [you] know plus eighty _to a_ hundred pound range . 
A|22| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|23| B: _that_ [is] [not] breed standard . 
A|24| A: huh . 
B|25| B: [fifty-five] [is] [the] minimum [but] _they_ usually run [about] sixty _to_ sixty-five _. _and_ the_ ones _that_ _are_ shown _they_ _are_ inside _that_ weight allowance . 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: [you] cannot show your [retriever] _if it's_ [you] know [a] hundred plus [pounds .] 
A|28| A: _oh_ huh . 
B|29| B: so don't say [she's] small [just] say _she's perfect ._ 
A|30| A: [yeah .] [she's perfect .] [well] [she's] got [a] brown nose instead [of] black too . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [which] _makes_ her [i] guess unshowable _even_ [if] she [had] _papers_ [which] she doesn't 
B|33| B: yep . 
A|34| A: [but] [but] _we_ _love_ her anyway . [she's] [just] [a] _lot of_ company [to] us . _we_ didn't _we_ haven't [had] _any_ [kids] [and] we're expecting [a] baby [this] summer [but] [up] until _then_ [she's] _been_ our substitute _kid_ [and] she [was a] _lot of_ fun . 
B|35| B: [well] _they_ _are_ _they_ _are_ [the] ultimate _dog_ [to] [have] around [kids] so long as your [kid] [is] [not] scared _of a_ big _dog_ _because_ _i _had_ a_ [retriever] actually _i _had_ a_ [retriever] irish setter cross . [which] [is] [a] [really] nice animal 
A|36| A: _right_ . _oh_ . 
B|37| B: [and] fortunately [it] [was] [just like a] _retriever and_ [then] [i've] _had a_ [retriever] . 
A|38| A: [i] _bet_ _it [had_ a] pretty coat too . 
B|39| B: [it] [was] gorgeous . [it] [was] [just] gorgeous _. i_ mean [just] gorgeous . um [and] _they_ _both_ [you] know _both_ [the] half breed _and the_ [pure] breed [had] [the uh] what [i] consider [the] [the] [the] [perfect] disposition . [but] [you] know what [you] know what scares me [about] [golden] retrievers ? _since_ they've become so popular [you] _get_ what [i] call backyard breeders . [which] [is] probably where yours came [from] . people _that_ don't know what [they're] doing [and] _they_ breed _them_ [you] know for [a] certain characteristic _. and_ in [the] retrievers [it] happens [to] be _they_ [like] _them_ big for somehow big [is] perceived as [the] better _. and_ [when] [you] start doing _that_ [you] [really] tamper _with_ [you] know [the] _all the_ [the] years [of] [uh] culling litters [and] [and] [uh] [you] tamper _with_ what [the] _dog_ innately [is] . 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [we] [when] [i] [was] [when] [i] bought _my_ last purebred [retriever] [i] mean [i] _looked_ _all_ over _because_ [i] wanted _one_ _that_ still _looked_ [like a] [retriever] [you] know [the] short [to] [the] ground stocky [golden] [uh] trainable tractable quiet animal _that_ could hunt [and] still be in [the] house . 
A|42| A: _right_ . 
B|43| B: _and i_ ended [up] getting _one_ _that_ [uh] came out _of a_ [a] [a] hunting stock _because_ [i] wanted _one_ _that_ could still perform [like a] [retriever] _did ._ 
A|44| A: _oh_ . 
B|45| B: [and] [i've seen] an awful [lot of] lately [really] dumb dumb retrievers [and] i'm _and i_ [really] fear for [the] breed _because_ [i] [love] _that_ breed 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [but] [i] [really] figure [right] [when] [it] becomes [really] popular _that_ _it's_ _going to_ be ruined . 
A|48| A: [we] [have] _some_ friends [with] [a] brother [and] sister [golden retriever and] _those_ [dogs] _have been_ having seizures [and i] wonder [since] [both] [of them] [are] having [them] [if it's] _some_ kind [of] _breeding_ problem . 
B|49| B: [oh] [yeah .] [you] [bet] [you] . [you] [bet] [you] . [you] know how _they_ came [up] [with] [the] [retriever] don't [you] [the] [golden] ? 
A|50| A: huh-uh . 
B|51| B: [it] [was] bred out [of] several different retrievers [and] _they_ bred [it] for companionship [and] [uh] [uh] disposition [and] [and] ability [to] hunt . [it] [was] kept only by kings . 
A|52| A: [oh] . 
B|53| B: [but] _they_ selectively culled [those] litters [i] mean for many hundreds [of] years [and] [since] [it] slept in [the] castle [with] its master [i] mean [it had] [it had] [to] be _of a_ disposition [to] make [it] [you] know an animal [you] could keep around _that_ closely . [but] _they_ _would_ go through _all the_ litters [and] destroy _the puppies_ [if] _they_ _were_ anything _other_ than [perfect .] now [you] know _that_ seems [like a] cruel thing [to] [do] . 
A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: on _the other_ hand [you] sure [you] know _they_ sure created [a] [a] wonderful breed [i] mean [a] wonderful breed . 
A|56| A: [yeah [.] they] [did [.] i] [i had] never [really] [had [a] golden retriever] _before_ . [we] _were going to_ _get a_ _shepherd and_ [something] mixed [because] [my] husband's family [had] [had] _shepherds_ [and] [all [the] other] [we] [looked] at _some_ [of the] _shepherd_ mixes [and [the] puppies] weren't [very] [uh] social [and] stuff . 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [and] [we] _went_ [to a] pen [of a] [little] bit bigger [dogs] [and] [all the] others [were] standing _there_ barking [and] jumping [up] [and] down [. and] [one] [dog] [would] stand _there_ wagging her tail [and] smiling [and] [that] [was] mine . 
B|59| B: [well] [i] tell [you] [you] know [the] [the] german [shepherd] [is] [the] classic case [of] what i'm talking [about] [because] in america that's called [a] rin tin tin phenomena . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: only in america [is] [there] [a] [dog] called [a] german [shepherd] . 
A|62| A: [oh] [really] ? 
B|63| B: [that] [dog] [is] bred out [of] three european [dogs] . [the] belgian tervurien [a] german skutzhund [and] [a] [makes] [a] [i] always forget [the] third [one] [. i] can see [it] . [uh] [uh] [but] [the] third [one] [is] [a] children's [dog] . 
A|64| A: [oh] . 
B|65| B: [and] [there] [are] distinct breeds in europe . now what happened over here [was] [is] [that] people saw [the] [the] first um [which] [would] actually [have been] [a] skutzhund [which] [is] what rin tin tin [was] . 
A|66| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [and] everybody wanted rin tin tin [. and] [it] [was] known as [a] german [shepherd] here . so [they] created [a] breed standard . [the] american kennel club [did .] 
A|68| A: [oh] . 
B|69| B: [that] said anything [that] [is] [a] skutzhund [a] [a] tervurien [and] [uh] alsatian that's [the other] [one] . alsatian [any] inner [breeding] [of] [that] can be called [a] german [shepherd] here . 
A|70| A: huh . 
B|71| B: [and] what happened [is] [is] [that] people wanted [this] [shepherd] [to] [shepherd and] protect [. and] [they] bred [a] [dog] [that] [i] [it's] called [a] an animal's critical span [which] basically translates [to] how much shit will [it] take [before] [it] bites [you] . [that] german [shepherd] [the] american german [shepherd] here [was a] [a] [a] such an unreliable animal [that] [the] american seeing eye institute refused [to] use [them] [because] [they] [would] turn on on their handlers . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] huh . [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and] [even] um [uh] police corps [which] started [you] know finding [other] breeds [to] use [because] [this] thing [this] [this] thing known as [a] german [shepherd] here its personality [and] its dependability [and] its reliability [was] [just] terrible . so [about] fifteen years ago [the] german [shepherd] club [of] america decided amongst themselves [that] [they] [were going to] change [this] . so [they] [went] back [to] europe [and] brought back [some] good examples [of] each [of the] three breeds [and] bred [to a] standard what [they] wanted an american german [shepherd] [to] be . [which] [is] [a] [very] heavily now skutzhund [and] alsatian 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [it's] [the] alsatian that's [the] kid's [dog] . [it's] [just] [you] see [them] in europe [and] [they're] [just] lovely . 
A|76| A: huh . 
B|77| B: [but] you'll see [i] mean [if] [you] ever start looking in [papers] now [and] [you] start seeing these ads for german [shepherds] [they] will say on [them] bred for disposition [a] k c conforming [which] means [that] their advertising [that] [this] [is] no longer an indiscriminate [dog] . 
A|78| A: huh . 
B|79| B: [this] [is] bred for [and] [they] [had] [to] go through [and] destroy [a] for [a] while [there] [about] seventy-five percent [of] their [puppies] [that] [they] bred . 
A|80| A: wow . 
B|81| B: [because] [they] [were] looking for [this] disposition [. and] nowadays [you] you'll [get] you'll [get a] [dog] trainer [to] recommend [a] specific [you] know breeder handler [. they] will recommend their [shepherds] as [a] children's [dog] . 
A|82| A: huh . 
B|83| B: [but] ...
