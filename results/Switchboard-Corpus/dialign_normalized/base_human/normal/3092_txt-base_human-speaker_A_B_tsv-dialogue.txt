A|0| A: _okay_ _, uh _,_ _do_ you_ _work_ outside _the_ home ? 
B|1| B: _no , _i_ do_ _not_ . 
A|2| A: _okay_ , wow 
B|3| B: [do _you] ?_ 
A|4| A: _have_ [you ?] 
B|5| B: [have] _i_ ? 
A|6| A: _yes ,_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: [uh _,] _no_ _,_ not_ actually 
A|8| A: _okay_ , _well ,_ _yes_ _i do ._ 
B|9| B: _okay ._ 
A|10| A: _in_ fact _, i am_ _at_ _work_ _right_ _now_ . [uh _,] and_ so let _me_ _take the_ lead _, uh ,_ angela . _uh , i think_ what _is_ _really_ _important_ _, uh ,_ _of_ course , _salary is_ very _important_ , _because_ _that's_ why _you are_ _working_ _for your_ _, for _the_ money_ _, but ,_ _job_ satisfaction _to me_ _is_ _also _,_ uh ,_ very _important_ _in_ having _a job_ _. and _,_ uh ,_ one _of the_ things _that _,_ uh _,_ she_ asked us _to_ discuss _was_ _benefits_ . [uh ,] i'm assuming _that_ _you are_ married _and_ _have a_ husband _that_ supports [you] . 
B|11| B: _right ._ 
A|12| A: [okay _.] and_ so _we_ _could_ _, we_ _could_ talk _about_ _, uh ,_ _that_ path _, you know ,_ how _important_ [you] _think_ _his_ _benefits are_ _. and , _and_ , _and_ _,_ uh ,_ how _important_ [you] _think_ _they_ _are_ _and _if_ ,_ what _would_ [you] _like to see_ increased _in_ _his_ _benefits_ . 
B|13| B: [okay .] 
A|14| A: _like _,_ uh ,_ perhaps _, uh ,_ he _has_ _, uh , the_ benefit _of_ having eyeglasses _for the_ _family _,_ uh _,_ uh _,_ and_ how _much_ coverage _, uh _,_ it_ provides _and_ _also ,_ _your_ hospital coverage _, _and_ _,_ uh _,_ um ,_ _probably_ _dental_ . how _important_ [you] _think _that_ would be_ . 
B|15| B: _right ._ _i [, i_ [think] that] [job] wise [benefits are] _just_ _as_ [important] _as_ [salary is] . 
A|16| A: _because_ _they_ , _of_ course _, if_ [you] did _not have_ _them_ _, _you_ _would_ _be_ pulling_ _from_ _your_ [salary] , _of_ course . 
B|17| B: exactly , 
A|18| A: _right ,_ 
B|19| B: exactly . 
A|20| A: [right .] 
B|21| B: _especially when you have a_ [family ,] _with children _,_ and [you_ are] _always_ going [to] [the] doctor _for ,_ 
A|22| A: [and] _they always_ [have] surprises [for] [you] . 
B|23| B: exactly , 
A|24| A: [with children ,] 
B|25| B: [they always] [do .] 
A|26| A: _you know , and_ so _, it's_ _, it is_ _, uh , we_ _could not_ [do] _without_ [the] benefit package _from_ _, from_ _any_ _company_ [that] _we_ worked [for ,] whether [they] _be_ [a] conglomerate _or_ [just] [a] small _, uh _,_ uh ,_ business . 
B|27| B: _yeah_ [, i think] [any] , [any] , even [if] [your] insurance policy [is] [not] [the] greatest . 
A|28| A: _you _would_ still_ [have] _something ._ 
B|29| B: exactly . [you] [you _would] not_ [be pulling] [it] out [of] [your] account _all_ [of the] time [just] by yourself . 
A|30| A: [right .] 
B|31| B: [also [,] for] [working] women [uh , i think] _a lot [of_ the] companies _should_ start providing [for] day-care _in _the_ _,_ _in_ _the_ _,_ _in_ the_ building . 
A|32| A: _yes_ . _uh-huh ._ [they] [are] getting [a] handle _on that [,_ in] fact _, uh ,_ _my_ oldest daughter [is] _, uh ,_ [is] [uh _,] a_ nurse _and she_ [just] received _her_ masters degree _and _she_ is_ _now_ into consulting [and] _that's_ one [of the] areas [that] _she is_ [working] _on_ . _to have , uh _,_ uh _,_ _a_ day care_ _center_ _for the_ [the] [children] [of [the] ,] [of the] nurses [that] [are] staffing [the] facility . 
B|33| B: [right .] 
A|34| A: [and] [that] [is] _true_ [in] many , many areas _of _,_ you know _,_ uh ,_ [job] titles [and] professions . 
B|35| B: _yeah ._ [like] [in] may case [, i] [have] three [children] *spelling: 'may' _should_ [be] 'my' [from] ages nine [to] _two_ [. and [,] it's] [just] unfeasible [for] [me] [to] try [to] _get_ [a job] [because] _all_ [the money] [that] [i] _would ,_ [be] making [would be] going [to] [day _care] ._ 
A|36| A: _uh-huh ._ sure . [would _,] it [would_ _,] _it would be_ just_ futile . 
B|37| B: [and] [it would be just] , 
A|38| A: [and] [they] [would _not] have_ [the] quality , 
B|39| B: basically [be] [me] [working] [to] pay [for] [them] [to] [be] [at] [a day care] , [center] . 
A|40| A: [and] [they] , [would be] deprived _of their_ _mother_ . 
B|41| B: exactly . 
A|42| A: [yeah .] [no , i] understand [that] totally 
B|43| B: besides _which_ [, it would be] _easier_ [, uh _,] there's _a_ lot of_ single mothers out _there_ [now] [, from] divorces [and] _a lot [of_ ,] women [are] starting [to have] babies [without] [a] partner . 
A|44| A: _oh [,_ i] hear , _yes _,_ that's true ._ 
B|45| B: [and] _to go_ [to] [work] [, [you] are] worried [about] [your] child , besides _which_ _you have to_ _get_ _up_ earlier [to] [take the] child [to] [day _care] ._ 
A|46| A: [right .] 
B|47| B: [and _if] _they_ were_ _in the_ same building then [you are] going [to] [the] same place , 
A|48| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|49| B: _and you_ [could] _go_ [for your] lunch hour down [and] visit [with] [your] child , [or] [, [you know ,] and] [take] [your] breaks [with] [your] [children ,] [or] [something .] 
A|50| A: _yes_ . [do you] _, [do_ you] [think that] [you] [should] fund [that] [if they] _have that_ _as a_ benefit _, if_ [you would] fund [that] somewhat [from] [your] [salary] [that] [you are] getting ? [do you] [think _that] would be_ , acceptable ? 
B|51| B: [i think] _i ,_ _think [it_ _would be] fair ._ 
A|52| A: [i do] too . 
B|53| B: [i think] [if [,] if] _the company_ [could not] provide [it] _all_ [on] [their] own [, for [the] [,] for the] _people_ [that would be] using _it [,_ you know [,] a] certain amount [of their] [salary] [would] _go_ [to] [it] . 
A|54| A: _right ,_ [that] [you] , [right .] _that's_ [right .] 
B|55| B: _but [it_ [would] still] [probably] [be] cheaper _with the company_ helping , _our_ [if] everybody [, you know ,] pulled [their] own weight [in] [it] . 
A|56| A: [with the company] _than_ , _than_ having [to go] _, that's _,_ that's_ [right .] _yes [,_ [i] ,] agree [with] [that] . 
B|57| B: _i think [it_ would be] [really] . [really] great . 
A|58| A: [that [would be] fair .] 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [i do .] 
A|62| A: [uh [,] and] how , how [do you] feel [about] [, uh ,] let's _see_ , _eye care_ ? 
B|63| B: [eye care] [is] good . [i do] _not [,_ i am] [not] [i do] [not] [think] _we [have_ that] [on] _our_ policy . 
A|64| A: [okay .] 
B|65| B: [but [,] uh , we] , 
A|66| A: vision [, i] guess [it's] called , vision [care .] 
B|67| B: [yeah .] [it would be] great [, _i] mean [,_ uh , the] glasses [that [,] the] exams themselves [are] [not] _expensive_ [, it's] [the] glasses . 
A|68| A: [it] depends [on] who examines [your] _eyes_ . 
B|69| B: [yeah] [, that's true .] 
A|70| A: [if] [you have] an , an optometrist [or] an ophthalmologist [, there's a] vast difference [in] _those_ [two] [, uh ,] professionals . 
B|71| B: [right ,] [now] [like] [my] ... [right .] [well ,] [like] [my] [mother] [, she] [has] [to go] [for] testing cause [she] [has] got , 
A|72| A: glaucoma . 
B|73| B: [well [,] she] does [not have] _it [,_ but [,] [she] is] [like ,] _on the_ verge _of it_ [or] , [something .] 
A|74| A: _oh ._ _oh ,_ [okay] , so , 
B|75| B: [her] [eyes] [are] changing , 
A|76| A: _yes_ . 
B|77| B: [and she] [has] [to] [be] tested periodically [. and , and] [those] [are] _expensive_ tests . 
A|78| A: _uh-huh ._ _yes _,_ they_ [are] . 
B|79| B: [now] [, i think] [your] insurance covers [her] [on that ,] 
A|80| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|81| B: [but] [you know [,] for] [something] [like] [that [,] that's] [just] [as] bad [as a] medical [, you know [,] that's ,] 
A|82| A: [right [,] that's] critical , [because] she's [in] need [of it] so often . 
B|83| B: [right .] 
A|84| A: _yes [,_ [and] [,] you know [,] [we] _have] , uh ,_ _needs_ [in] [our] life [that] [are] unique [to] us [and [,] uh [,] you know ,] [people] [have] _needs_ [in] [their] life [that] unique [to] us _, to_ [them] . 
B|85| B: [right .] 
A|86| A: [i mean [,] we] [are] [all] different so , 
B|87| B: [now] [, i] [would] [like to see] better [dental] insurance [to _me] ._ [was] [that] [our] beep ? 
A|88| A: [well [,] no] [that's] [my] other phone . 
B|89| B: [oh .] huh . 
A|90| A: so [, that's] [it] [that's] [okay] , [my] , [that] phone [is] ringing [to] an empty desk [and] she's [on] vacation , 
B|91| B: [okay .] 
A|92| A: so [, it's] [okay .] 
B|93| B: [but ,] [with the] three [children] [um ,] orthopedic [care] [, um _,] not_ orthopedic , _orthodontic_ [care] , 
A|94| A: _uh-huh ._ [that's] very [expensive] . 
B|95| B: [because] [on] , [on] _a lot [of_ the] [dental] insurance [, they] [do] [not] cover [that] [well] . [for [the] [,] the] orthodontia stuff . 
A|96| A: _yes [,_ that's true .] [orthodontic] [work] [is] terribly [expensive] . 
B|97| B: [yes [,] it is] . 
A|98| A: [especially when you have [a] lot of] problems [with the] [children] teeth [, [and] [, and] [you] have to] [really] [get] [them] [when] [they] [are] young [, in] order _to have , uh _,_ not [,_ uh [,] a] decent smile [when] [they] [are] fifteen , sixteen years _old_ . 
B|99| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
A|100| A: [i] [know ,] [two] [of] [my] daughters had [to [have] that] [and] [they] started having extractions [at] age eight [, uh ,] [because] [they] [just] had too many teeth [for] [their] size mouth . 
B|101| B: [yeah .] 
A|102| A: [and] [we] footed [the] bill , [because] [there] [was] [not] [any] such thing [and] [when] [they were] young . 
B|103| B: [right .] [my] middle child [needs] [to have , uh ,] [orthodontic] , he's [because] [his] , [his] pallet [is] squared [, not] rounded . 
A|104| A: _oh ,_ [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: [and] [it] affects [his] speech [a] little bit [, not [,] not] anything [, you know ,] 
A|106| A: [uh-huh] , major . 
B|107| B: [right .] 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [but] [just] enough [that] [his] bite [is] off [a] little bit [and] [it's] [like] four hundred dollars [, and] [my] insurance [is] only going [to] cover [like] fifty [of it] . 
A|110| A: [well [,] i] tell [you] [i , i] [just] read an article [in the] paper [about] what [they] [are] doing [, [i think] it] [was] an ad [in] [, in] [our] publication [at] texas instruments , where [they] [are] breaking [the] jaw [and , and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with the] teeth . 
B|111| B: [oh .] 
A|112| A: [it's] [, it's] less painful [and] less [expensive] . 
B|113| B: [really] . 
A|114| A: [yeah .] 
B|115| B: [that] sounds [like] [it would] hurt more . 
A|116| A: [i , i] [know [,] [but] [it] [,] it's] [, it's] [, uh ,] [easier] [on the] patient [in the] long run , [which] amazed [me .] 
B|117| B: [oh ,] gosh . [i , i] [would] [much] rather [that [,] do] [that [,] to] myself [than] make [my] five year [old] [go] [in] [and] [do] [it] . [that would] kill [me .]
