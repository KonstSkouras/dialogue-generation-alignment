A|0| A: _well_ brent , i've been _, um _,_ i_ _kind of_ gave up _my_ _career_ _about_ _three_ years ago _to_ _stay home with_ _my _children_ because_ _i_ _thought_ _, uh ,_ _if_ _it _,_ it's_ _only_ _going_ _to be_ another _year_ until _the_ _youngest is_ _in school ._ 
B|1| B: _right ._ 
A|2| A: _and_ _i_ _thought it was_ _a_ _good_ _sacrifice _to make_ ,_ _because _,_ um ,_ _it was_ _important_ _to_ me _to _,_ to_ _spend_ _some_ _time with_ _kids ._ 
B|3| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|4| A: _i know that_ _when_ _i_ _was_ _in _school_ and_ getting _my_ degree _at_ _the_ same _time_ _my_ husband _was_ , _it was_ _really_ _hard_ _on_ _our_ _family_ _because_ _i_ _would ,_ he _would_ _come home and_ _i_ _would_ _leave_ , 
B|5| B: _right ._ 
A|6| A: _and then_ _when_ _i_ _would_ _come home and_ he _would_ _leave_ _, and _,_ um _,_ so_ _i think_ _one_ _day_ _one_ _of_ _our_ _kids_ _said _,_ you know ,_ someone came _home _and_ they_ _said _,_ well , when_ _is_ dad leaving _or_ something _. _it_ was_ _like that_ _they thought_ _that's_ _the way_ life _was_ _, that_ _you_ _didn't_ _have two_ parents _at home_ _at_ _the_ same _time_ . 
B|7| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|8| A: _and so_ _i _think_ _,_ um _,_ it's_ become real _important_ _to_ me _that_ _we_ _try to_ _spend_ _time _together_ as a family _._ so_ _there's_ _one or_ _two_ nights _a week _,_ we_ _have _a_ _,_ on_ monday nights _we_ set aside _time_ _where_ _it's_ called _, uh ,_ _family home evening_ _and we_ _stay home_ _that_ _evening _,_ _all_ of_ us _, and we_ _do_ _things_ _together ._ 
B|9| B: _uh-huh _._ you_ must [be] [a] . 
A|10| A: _yes ._ 
B|11| B: [so] _am_ [i] . 
A|12| A: _oh _,_ you_ _are_ ? 
B|13| B: [yes] , _what_ [a] coincidence . 
A|14| A: [yes] _and ,_ 
B|15| B: _yeah , [i_ know] _what_ [family home] evening's [all] [about] . 
A|16| A: [so] [you] _do that_ _and _,_ _right ,_ _and then_ we_ _try to_ _do_ _a family_ activity _on_ _saturday_ , usually _in the_ morning . 
B|17| B: _uh-huh ._ [right , and then] _the [family_ home [evening] _,] too_ . 
A|18| A: [right , and then] _, you know ,_ _sometimes_ _we_ _try to_ _do_ _our_ lesson _on_ sunday night [and then] _our_ activity _or_ something _on_ monday _but _,_ we're_ _, it's_ real _important_ _to_ us _to_ _spend_ _time together ._ 
B|19| B: _right _._ _well ,_ that's good ._ [um ,] how many [children] [do] [you] [have] ? 
A|20| A: _i have two_ . 
B|21| B: [two] ? 
A|22| A: [uh-huh .] _i _have_ a_ girl _and a_ boy _, and the_ boy's _five_ , he's _in_ kindergarten _, and the_ girl _is_ _four_ . she'll [be] _in_ kindergarten next _year ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [i have two] daughters . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [my] oldest _is [,_ uh ,] [four] [and] [my] [youngest is] [about] [to] turn [three] . [two] girls . [and _they] are a handful_ 
A|26| A: [they are a handful] . 
B|27| B: [yes .] we've , [my] [, uh [,] well , when] [we] _first_ got married , [my] wife worked _for a_ [year .] [then we] _decided _to_ have_ [kids .] 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [and [,] uh ,] she , she got pregnant [and then we] _decided_ she [would] [stay home _with] the [kids_ .] [we] [would] [make] [that] [sacrifice] [. _it] is_ [a] _financial_ [sacrifice to make] [because] [we] _go_ from [two] incomes down [to] [one] . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [and [,] uh [,] we] made [that] decision [and [,] uh [,] so] after she _had_ _the first_ baby , she stayed [home] . _and [, and_ we] _had_ [a] second baby [and] she's still [at home] 
A|32| A: [yes .] 
B|33| B: _and so [,_ uh [,] you know ,] [at] work _a lot of_ _people_ [are] _, you know _, i_ think_ [well] this [is] _not_ [a] normal situation anymore [in] [our] _, in_ [our] world [we] live [in] . most [of] _them [,_ uh ,] continue [to] work [if] [they] _have ,_ [have] [kids .] 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [i] [only] [have] [one] _other_ _person_ [i know] [in] [my] _, in_ [my] group _here that_ works [where] [the] wife _stays_ _home _,_ and that's_ [because] [of] _religious_ values [as] [well] . they're baptists _and they [,_ [and] they] [think] [that's] _important ._ 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [but] _everybody_ else works [and they] drop _their_ [kids] off [at] day-care _and , and_ [leave] _them [and_ [,] i] _don't_ _know , i_ _just_ _don't_ want [, i] _just_ _don't_ want strangers raising [my children] . 
A|38| A: [well ,] _no_ [, and] _it's _, it's_ _just_ _not_ _,_ um _,_ it's _not_ as_ stable [for] [the _kids] ,_ 
B|39| B: _right ._ 
A|40| A: [and they ,] [everybody] [decided to] _come_ over [and] talk [to] me [right] _now_ _. _but_ , uh _,_ it's _,_ _yeah_ ._ 
B|41| B: [that's] how _it is_ [at] [our] house [when] _you're_ [on] [the] phone . [oh [,] it's] open , anything goes [when] mom's [on] [the] phone 
A|42| A: [well [,] it's] also [important] [, i _think] _,_ um ,_ [for] [my] husband . [i] [, i] _try _to_ go_ _out_ [of] [my] _way_ _to _,_ to_ plan _things_ [that] he _can_ [do] [with the kids] _because ,_ since [i] [am] [home with] [them [and] so] [i] get [a lot of] _time with_ [them ,] he needs [to [have] _,] um ,_ _some_ _time with_ [them] . 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [so] he [, when] he comes [home ,] he _, um _,_ you know , it's_ his job [at] night . he puts [the kids] [to] bed , 
B|45| B: _right ._ 
A|46| A: [and] he reads [to] [them ,] 
B|47| B: _right ._ 
A|48| A: [and] he spends [about] _an hour_ _doing_ _that [,_ and that's] [, that's] pretty [good] quality _time _,_ with_ [them ,] 
B|49| B: _right ._ 
A|50| A: [and _,] um _,_ but_ _it's hard_ [for] him [on] saturdays . he , he wants _, right ,_ he wants _to run_ _out_ [and] get _things_ done , 
B|51| B: [with] [all] [the] yard work [and] [things] [like that] . 
A|52| A: [and so _,] um [,_ i] _try _to_ _say_ [,_ well ,] why [don't] [you] [go] fly kites _or_ why [don't] [you] [do] something . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [and] [if] [i have] something [in] mind _, then_ he , he remembers _that [,_ that's] [what] he wants [to] [do] . 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] [right [,] we] feel _that , you know ,_ [just] spending [time together _.] you_ [don't] necessarily [have] [to be] [doing] anything [, you know [,] that] costs money [or] , [or] [, you know [,] that] requires [you] [to go] [a] great distance [or] anything [like that] _. [it's_ just] [the kids] [like] [to ,] being [together as a family .] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [like] last [saturday] [we] _went_ , _had_ [some] errands [to run] [and so] [we] _took_ [the kids] _and , and_ _went_ by [the] farmers market down [in] _, in_ , down there [in] garland . 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and they] _had_ [a] blast running around [the] farmers market looking [at] [all] [the] [, you know _,] the_ food [and] tasting [all] [the] free samples [they] were giving [out] . [and they] _had_ [a] little pen there [with] animals [in] [they] could pet [, you know ,] 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [and they] liked [that] . [and then] [on] [the way] [home] [we] drove by [the] local high [school and] there happened [to be] [an] f [a ,] f [a] [a ,] _future_ f [a ,] _future_ farmers [of] america , f f [a] [going] [on] there , 
A|62| A: [yes .] 
B|63| B: [and they] _had_ [all] kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and] everything [, you know [,] all] [out] [in] this _, in the_ _, in_ this schoolyard there [. so] [we] [just] [said ,] hey , let's stop [and] [and [the] kids] got [to go] around [and [,] you know ,] _see_ pigs [and] animals [and] [things] [like [that] ,] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: _and , and_ [for] [them] [that's] wonderful [, you know] . [they _,] [they_ [thought] it was] [the] greatest fun [, you know [,] _and] it_ [didn't] cost any money . [and [,] uh [,] you] [don't] [have] quite _as much_ money [when] [, when] [the] wife doesn't work . 
A|66| A: [well , that's] [right _.] but_ [i] [do] _think _,_ um [,_ you know ,] [like] [the] current trends [are] [that _,] um [,_ [the] family] unit [is] devaluated [. _it's] not_ nearly [as] [important .] 
B|67| B: [right .] 
A|68| A: [we] find [that , you know ,] _back_ [just] even fifty years ago [when] [people] [had] [financial] problems [, [the] first] _place_ [they] [went] [to] [was] [their] [family .] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [and] families [took] care [of] themselves [and _,] um _,_ _but_ _now_ _,_ you know , people_ [don't] [, _they] don't_ support each [other] [that] [way] . 
B|71| B: [right .] [right .] [oh ,] definitely motherhood [is] devalued [in] this society . [if] _you're_ , [stay] [at [home] and] _you're_ [a] mother [, it's] [like] [what] [a] waste . [people] [think [,] you know [,] you] should [be] fulfilling yourself 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: _and , [and_ a] mother isn't [an] [important] [important] _thing_ [as] _, as_ having [a] [career] 
A|74| A: [that's] [right] [and ,] 
B|75| B: _and , and_ [that] should [be] [first] _and , and_ [children] second [. but] [they don't] [have] [kind of] [an] , [what] [we] call [an] internal perspective [of] [things] . 
A|76| A: _right , right ,_ 
B|77| B: [but] [that ,] 
A|78| A: [and] _it's not_ [an] easy [sacrifice] [for a] [person] _to make ,_ _because [, you know ,_ i] [, you know , [i] have] interests [that [,] too] , 
B|79| B: _no ._ [right .] 
A|80| A: [and [it] is] _hard_ _to make , uh ,_ those interests [not] [be] [as a] major _part of_ [my] life . 
B|81| B: [uh ,] [at] this point . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [it's not] [to _say] that_ [some] [day] [you] won't [go] [back] [to] work . [my] mother's [a] [school] teacher [and] [when] [, when] [we] started [, uh ,] having [kids ,] she [had] [to] work [for a] little while [, but] [then] she [just] started substituting . 
A|84| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [so] she [would] [just] substitute once [or] twice [a week [,] you know ,] [just] [for] [that] little extra money [when] [we] were [in school .] [then we] [would] [just] [come home and] [just] [be] [, you know ,] [go] [to] [a] neighbor's house [for] [an hour] [, then] she'd [be] [home] [. but] she wouldn't [do that] every [day] . 
A|86| A: [right .] 
B|87| B: [but now] [that] [my] , [my] [, uh ,] [youngest] sister's [at] b y u [now [,] [and] so] [they] [have] [no] [one] [at [home] ,] she's [back] teaching [school] full [time] [now ,] again [. so] [if] [, you know [, it's] [not] [,] it's just] [a] _temporary_ _thing_ . 
A|88| A: [it is] [temporary] [. _it] [,_ in the] middle _of _it_ ,_ [it] seems [like] [a] long _time ,_ 
B|89| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|90| A: [but] [you're] [right ,] [it is] [temporary] [. well [,] i] [see] [that] [we] both share [the] same belief [here that] [it's] [important] [that] [we] _spend_ _time with_ [our] [kids] 
B|91| B: [yeah .] 
A|92| A: _and , and [,_ in] spite _of ,_ 
B|93| B: _yeah [,_ _yeah] [,_ you] [, [it's ,] [it's] hard] [sometimes] [at] work [because [, you know ,] people] [say ,] [oh [,] we're] taking [a] cruise [, we're] [going] [here] [, we're] [going] there [, you know] [because] [they] [have [a] lot] more money . 
A|94| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [and [a] lot of] [them] decide [just not] [to have] [children] . 
A|96| A: [yes .] 
B|97| B: [it's , it's] amazing [, they] either [have] [one or] none . 
A|98| A: [that's] true . 
B|99| B: [and [, and] the] [one] [person] [i know that] has [one] [, [they] [,] they] feel guilty . she has this continual guilt trip [that] she's [not] [doing] [the] [right] _thing_ [, [and] so] [on] [, uh [,] on] weekends she [would [,] you know ,] [spend] [all of] her [time with] her [kids] [and] [spend] lots [of ,] lots [and] lots [of] money . basically [, i think] [they [,] they] [really] spoil [the] child [, to] [try to] overcompensate [for] [their] guilt feelings . 
A|100| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [and , [and ,] [and] [they] don't] want [to have] anymore [children because] [they] [just] [don't] [think [,] you know [,] [that] ,] she doesn't [think] she could [be] [a] mother [at home] . [that's] [not] her bag [. so] she [just] doesn't [think] [that] she could [, you know [,] the] guilt feelings , she can't deal [with] [with] [it] anymore 
A|102| A: [yeah .] 
B|103| B: [so ,] 
A|104| A: [well ,] [it [is] [,] the] hardest [thing] i've ever done [, [as] much] [as] you'd [go] [out] 
B|105| B: [you know ,] 
A|106| A: [and ,] 
B|107| B: [uh-huh _.] yeah ,_ [my] wife [, uh ,] likes staying [home] . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [uh ,] she works [at home] [some] , though . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [the] [place] she works [with] , worked [with] before [, um ,] worked [out] [an] arrangement [with] her [where] she [can] work [at [home] ,] [part] [time ,] 
A|112| A: [well , that's good .] 
B|113| B: [and so [,] uh [,] [that] [,] it's] [kind of] [a] seasonal [thing] . [three] times [a] [year] she's [really] busy [doing] certain [things] based [on] [that] [kind of] business , 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: [but] [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . she likes [to] sew [and] [do] crafts [and] [things] [like that] [so] she enjoys staying [at [home] [,] [but] , uh [,] the] money [part [of] [it] is] [not as] rewarding , obviously [, but] [there's] different rewards [, you know ,] different kinds [of] rewards . 
A|116| A: [no [.] [yeah [,] i] think] [so] . [i think] [it's] [an] investment [in] _your_ [future] , even [if] [it's] purely [not ,] [not] [religious] [. you] [can] [at] least [say that] [it's] [important] [to] [our] country [, that] [our] [family] unit [stays] strong . 
B|117| B: [right , [right ,] [right] .] [and] [you] [really] [have] [to make , uh ,] quite [a] bit [of] money . [the] wife doesn't [make] [it] worth [it [,] [with] the] cost [of] day-care . 
A|118| A: [yes .] 
B|119| B: [i know] [there's] [, you know [,] when] [you] adjust [your] income [for] [what] [you] put [out] [for] day-care [, you know ,] [you're] [only] making [like] [five] .
