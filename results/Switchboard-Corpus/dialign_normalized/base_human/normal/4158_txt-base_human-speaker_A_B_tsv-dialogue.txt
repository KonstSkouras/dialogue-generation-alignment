A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ _oh_ . _is that_ how _you_ heard about _this_ _thing_ ? 
B|5| B: _yeah ,_ 
A|6| A: [uh ,] 
B|7| B: actually through electronic mail . 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ me _too_ _. i_ [work] _at _,_ uh , the_ georgia tech _research_ institute . 
B|9| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|10| A: _um , i'm_ _a_ co-op student _so i_ [work and] go _to_ school about halftime .

B|11| B: [right] . [so] _it's_ _pretty_ fair they've got [you] slaving away , [at ,] [at] [this] point 
A|12| A: exactly . exactly . 
B|13| B: _yeah ._ 
A|14| A: _what_ about [you] ? 
B|15| B: _well [,_ [um ,] i'm] [research] _stuff_ _here_ [now] [so] [what] [they] [, they] _have [,_ uh [,] um ,] okay , [benefits] package . _it's_ _not_ quite as good as industry _but_ one _of the_ significant [, um ,] [benefits] _here_ [is that] [you] _can_ _take_ [, uh ,] up [to] two courses [a] semester [, um ,] [and] [they] _pay for_ _you know , _pay for_ the classes_ . 
A|16| A: huh . 
B|17| B: [so] _, that_ _works_ _out_ [to] _be_ [, um ,] [a] reasonable , [a] reasonable _benefit_ . 
A|18| A: [yeah .] [uh [,] they] _do_ [that] [i] think _if_ you're [, uh ,] [research] [here] then [i] [know] [of] some [of the] people [that] [have] gotten their masters [and] [i] think _that [,_ um [,] they] might _, [you know ,_ pay for] [that] . [pay for the classes] [and] [stuff] 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [but] [i] [know] [they] let [you] , they'll let [you] decrease how many hours [you] [work] by _kind of_ percentage . [you know ,] they'll let [you] [work] halftime _if you want to ,_ _if you want to_ finish , 
B|21| B: [if you want to ,] [do] _it_ quickly . 
A|22| A: [you want to _,] yeah ._ they'll let [you] [work] , decrease your number [of] hours by any percentage _just_ , _just_ about [so] [if you want to] get your masters [and] then [, i] think [of] course [you] get _like_ [a] , _with_ your extra degrees [you] get [a] [pay] raise due [so] [that] will probably help [out] . 
B|23| B: [uh-huh] , _uh-huh . _yeah _._ yeah_ ._ [so i] [, i don't know] _in_ _, in_ terms [of] other things , other [benefits] other than sort [of] monetary _i'd_ [, you know [,] i] [, _yeah] _,_ we_ _, we_ [do] [. we] _have to_ contribute [a] certain amount [, uh ,] [to] _it_ . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [and] _it's_ [kind of] split between c m u [and ,] [and [,] you know [,] the] employee . 
A|26| A: [yeah _. yeah] [,_ i] think _, i mean_ _that's _pretty_ ,_ _that's a_ _pretty important_ [, uh ,] part [of] [it] there because _that , that_ [can] [be] _really_ expensive [if _you] ever_ [have] any _health_ problems . my dad [, i] think my [, i'm] still covered _on_ , _with_ my dad's [, uh ,] _health_ plan [at] his , _where_ he [works] _, but_ [it] would definitely [be] something [to] look into once [i] get my own . 
B|27| B: [right] [. yeah ,] [and] _it's_ also , [right now] _it's_ [, uh , _the] ,_ [like] everywhere _else_ [, uh ,] [here] _in_ pittsburgh [the] [health care] [, uh ,] rates [are] [, are] going up [pretty] quickly . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [that's _a] whole_ other topic [to] begin [with] [too] [but] [. yeah [,] but] _it's_ [, you] [are] [right] [. i] [, i] [, i really] agree [that , that] [that's [pretty] important] . 
A|30| A: [the] [i] think [the [,] i] guess [the] only real [, um ,] [benefit] [i] guess _you could_ say [working] [, for] me [working] [here] , besides _i mean_ [i'm] learning [and] [stuff] because [, i'm] [at _,] you know , in_ school . 
B|31| B: [right] . 
A|32| A: [but] there's , there's some _where_ [, uh [,] uh ,] student employees [working] [for the] government [don't] [have to] [pay] _social security_ tax _. that's_ about , five percent [right] there 
B|33| B: [right] . [uh-huh] [oh] [now] [that's a] big win . 
A|34| A: [so] . 
B|35| B: [yeah [,] yeah [.] that's] , 
A|36| A: [that's] about [the] only real bonus 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: [i] [have _,] [so_ i] [have to] [take] [that] into consideration when [i] evaluate [like] how much [i] get paid [you know ,] because [if] [i] was [working] somewhere [else] [i'd] [have [to] [,] [you know ,] pay] an extra five percent , or [so] . 
B|39| B: [yeah [.] i] figured [for] [and] they've [just] raised [the [,] um ,] income caps [on] [social security] [to] [the] point [where] [you] [have to] [be] [pretty [,] you] [have to] [be] [pretty] _well_ off before [you] stop paying paying [that] as _well_ . 
A|40| A: huh [. yeah .] 
B|41| B: [yeah _,] well_ [if [you] could] call [it] [a] [benefit] [that] c m u [, i mean] [the] other [thing] [that] [they] allow [you] [to] [do] [here] while [you] [are] [working] [is] , [is] consult [for] [, um [,] you know ,] other companies . 
A|42| A: [oh] [, yeah] ? 
B|43| B: [um [,] so] [that's] [, that] [kind of] helps [out] [in] terms _of , you know ,_ keeping up-to-date [with] contacts [in] industry . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh . yeah .] 
B|45| B: [you know , in] case [, you know , in] case [you ever] need [to] bail [out] 
A|46| A: help [a] lot [. yeah .] see around , around [here] [it's] [like] [, uh [,] we] [pretty] much [work] from project [to] project [on] [, [well] [,] you know ,] [with] different sponsors .
