A|0| A: _um_ _are_ _you_ _working_ _right now_ ? 
B|1| B: _uh_ yes _i_ am . _i'm_ [working] _in_ _the_ computer science department _here_ _uh_ _at_ c m u . 
A|2| A: [uh] _what_ _kind of_ _what_ _kind of_ _work_ _do_ _you_ _do_ ? 
B|3| B: [uh] _i'm_ doing basically system system design _work _and_ uh_ implementation [work] _for the_ speech _for the_ speech group [uh] _here_ . 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ _oh_ . _is that_ how _you_ heard about _this_ _thing_ ? 
B|5| B: _yeah_ 
A|6| A: [uh] 
B|7| B: actually through electronic mail . 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ me _too_ _. i_ [work] [at] _uh the_ georgia tech _research_ institute . 
B|9| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|10| A: _um i'm_ _a_ co-op student _so i_ [work and] go _to_ school about halftime . [and uh] _i really_ _don't_ _have_ any job _benefits_ _to_ speak _of_ . we're _kind of_ _um_ _i don't know_ _they_ _just_ _kind of_ forget us _on_ _that_ end _. we_ _don't_ _really_ _have_ any vacation or _you know_ sick days or _health care_ or anything _really_ _so_ . 
B|11| B: [right] . [so] _it's_ _pretty_ fair they've got [you] slaving away [at] [at] [this] point 
A|12| A: exactly . exactly . 
B|13| B: _yeah ._ 
A|14| A: _what_ about [you] ? 
B|15| B: _well_ [um i'm] [research] _stuff_ _here_ [now] [so] [what] [they] [they] [have] [uh] [um] okay [benefits] package . _it's_ _not_ quite as good as industry _but_ one _of the_ significant [um] [benefits] _here_ [is that] [you] _can_ _take_ [uh] up [to] two courses [a] semester [um] [and] [they] _pay for_ _you know _pay for_ the classes_ . 
A|16| A: huh . 
B|17| B: _so that_ _works_ _out_ [to] _be_ [um] [a] reasonable [a] reasonable _benefit_ . 
A|18| A: [yeah .] [uh] [they] _do_ [that] [i] think _if_ you're [uh] [research] [here] then [i] [know] [of] some [of the] people [that] [have] gotten their masters [and] [i] think [that] [um] [they] might [you know pay for] [that] . [pay for the classes] [and] [stuff] 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [but] [i] [know] [they] let [you] they'll let [you] decrease how many hours [you] [work] by _kind of_ percentage . [you know] they'll let [you] [work] halftime _if you want to_ _if you want to_ finish 
B|21| B: [if you want to] [do] _it_ quickly . 
A|22| A: [you want to] [yeah .] they'll let [you] [work] decrease your number [of] hours by any percentage _just_ _just_ about [so] [if you want to] get your masters [and] then [i] think [of] course [you] get _like_ [a] _with_ your extra degrees [you] get [a] [pay] raise due [so that] will probably help [out] . 
B|23| B: [uh-huh] _uh-huh . _yeah _._ yeah_ ._ [so i] [i don't _know] in_ _in_ terms [of] other things other [benefits] other than sort [of] monetary _i'd_ [you know] [i] [yeah] [we] [we] [do] [. we] _have to_ contribute [a] certain amount [uh] [to] _it_ . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [and] _it's_ [kind of] split between c m u [and] [and] [you know] [the] employee . 
A|26| A: [yeah . yeah] [i] think _i mean_ _that's pretty_ _that's a_ _pretty important_ [uh] part [of] [it] there because _that that_ [can] [be] _really_ expensive [if _you] ever_ [have] any _health_ problems . my dad [i] think my [i'm] still covered _on_ _with_ my dad's [uh] _health_ plan [at] his _where_ he [works] [but] [it] would definitely [be] something [to] look into once [i] get my own . 
B|27| B: [right] [. yeah] [and] _it's_ also [right now] _it's_ [uh the] [like] everywhere _else_ [uh] [here] _in_ pittsburgh [the] [health care] [uh] rates [are] [are] going up [pretty] quickly . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [that's _a] whole_ other topic [to] begin [with] [too] [but] [. yeah] [but] _it's_ [you] [are] [right] [. i] [i] [i really] agree [that that] [that's [pretty] important] . 
A|30| A: [the] [i] think [the] [i] guess [the] only real [um] [benefit] [i] guess _you could_ say [working] [for] me [working] [here] besides _i mean_ [i'm] learning [and] [stuff] because [i'm] [at] _you know in_ school . 
B|31| B: [right] . 
A|32| A: [but] there's there's some _where_ [uh] [uh] student employees [working] [for the] government [don't] [have to] [pay] _social security_ tax _. that's_ about five percent [right] there 
B|33| B: [right] . [uh-huh] [oh] [now] [that's a] big win . 
A|34| A: [so] . 
B|35| B: [yeah] [yeah [.] that's] 
A|36| A: [that's] about [the] only real bonus 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: [i] [have] [so i] [have to] [take] [that] into consideration when [i] evaluate [like] how much [i] get paid [you know] because [if] [i] was [working] somewhere [else] [i'd] [have to] [you know pay] an extra five percent or [so] . 
B|39| B: [yeah [.] i] figured [for] [and] they've [just] raised [the] [um] income caps [on] [social security] [to] [the] point [where] [you] [have to] [be] [pretty] [you] [have to] [be] [pretty] _well_ off before [you] stop paying paying [that] as _well_ . 
A|40| A: huh [. yeah .] 
B|41| B: [yeah] _well_ [if [you] could] call [it] [a] [benefit] [that] c m u [i mean] [the] other [thing] [that] [they] allow [you] [to] [do] [here] while [you] [are] [working] [is] [is] consult [for] [um] [you know] other companies . 
A|42| A: [oh] [yeah] ? 
B|43| B: [um] [so] [that's] [that] [kind of] helps [out] [in] terms _of you know_ keeping up-to-date [with] contacts [in] industry . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh . yeah .] 
B|45| B: [you know in] case [you know in] case [you ever] need [to] bail [out] 
A|46| A: help [a] lot [. yeah .] see around around [here] [it's] [like] [uh] [we] [pretty] much [work] from project [to] project [on] [well] [you know] [with] different sponsors . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: there's [not] there [is] [not] [a whole] lot [of you know] funded [research] from
