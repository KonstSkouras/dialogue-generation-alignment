A|0| A: okay jerry _i_ guess tonight's topic _is_ _about_ _recycling_ . 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _and_ _i'd_ _like_ _to_ tell _you_ first _of_ _all_ _what's_ happening _in_ _our_ _community_ here _in_ plano . 
B|3| B: _all right ._ 
A|4| A: _right now_ _we_ _have_ _a_ pretty nice _recycling_ program where _a_ lot _of the_ _recyclable materials_ can _be_ picked _up_ by _the_ by _the_ collection agency _or_ _the the_ _city_ along _with_ _your_ garbage can . _uh you_ can _put_ _out_ newspaper _you_ can _put_ _out_ glass _you_ can _put_ _out_ aluminum cans _you_ can _put_ _put_ _out_ certain types _of plastic_ material _and_ _that_ _is_ _on a_ roll _out_ effort _right now_ . _not_ [all] _the_ citizens _and the_ people _in_ plano can _go_ ahead _and uh_ participate _right now_ _but_ _uh_ _that_ _will be_ rolled _out_ _to_ everyone _i_ hope _in the_ next year _or_ _so_ . _and_ those _that_ aren't participating _they_ _have_ _the_ specific drop _off_ sites where _you_ can _take_ glass _and_ newspaper _and_ aluminum . _and _i_ think_ _uh_ overall _that's_ _an_ _an_ excellent opportunity _because_ _i_ hate _to_ _see_ _our_ landfills being filled _up_ _and uh_ growing bigger _and_ bigger _and_ bigger where _they_ are becoming _a_ big _problem_ _for_ _not_ _only_ _the_ people _that_ are living today _but_ _for_ _the_ future also _. so_ 
B|5| B: yeah [uh] [i] was 
A|6| A: how _about_ _your_ _community_ ? 
B|7| B: my [community] [that's] cute _. i_ live [in] _a place_ called _dye mound_ . 
A|8| A: [dye mound] ? 
B|9| B: [or] [dye] [community] . 
A|10| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|11| B: [and] _it's_ [not] [a] [city] [not] incorporated my nearest neighbor's [about] [a] half [a] mile _at_ least [i] can't even [see] their house [and uh] 
A|12| A: sounds _like_ [a place] where [i] grew _up_ 
B|13| B: yeah [i] mean [uh] i'm [out] [in] i'm [out] [in the] wilderness . literally . 
A|14| A: _well i_ _like_ _it ._ 
B|15| B: [and uh] [well] give [you] [an] _idea_ _it's_ three [and] [a] half miles [of] dirt road [to] [the] concrete [i] mean [to] [the] asphalt we're [out] there . 
A|16| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: [and uh] [we] [i] _do_ _some_ interesting [recycling] things . 
A|18| A: [well] good . 
B|19| B: i'm building [our] house [right now] [and] i'm going _to incorporate_ into my [uh] garage area [a] weight activated [uh] crusher . 
A|20| A: oh okay . 
B|21| B: [so] when [i] drive [the] car [in the] [in the] driveway [in the] afternoon [it] [it] [will] just drive [it] [up] [on a] ramp [that] actually puts me [on] top [of [the] the] [uh] pressure side [of] [a] [uh] _hydraulic_ cylinder . 
A|22| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [and the] weight [of the] car [will] crush [what's] ever [in the] disposer . 
A|24| A: oh . 
B|25| B: hopefully _it's_ [not] my wife . 
A|26| A: [well] let's hope [not] _. you_ can _be_ [uh] _get_ [in] trouble _for _that_ ._ 
B|27| B: [well i] _thought_ [i'd] _you know_ [i'd] use [it] as [a] [an] escapement type _thing_ _. i_ don't _know_ _if_ you're familiar [with] [that] operation [but] what [you] _do_ [is] [you] just build [up] [the] pressure 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [and] _then_ [you] [go] over [and] _release it_ [and] _then_ [it] just [it] just drops _you know_ . 
A|30| A: [well] [it's] quite _similar_ [to] [a] [hydraulic] _jack_ isn't [it] ? 
B|31| B: very [similar] yeah . 
A|32| A: okay okay . 
B|33| B: [well] what what [it] [will be] [you] just [you] drive [up] [on] [the] [jack] [but] [you] [it] won't [go] down . 
A|34| A: yes _until you_ [release _it] ._ 
B|35| B: [until you] pull [the] pin yeah . 
A|36| A: [all right .] 
B|37| B: anyway [i] [have] another [uh] [recycling] method [i] use . 
A|38| A: _i think_ yes . 
B|39| B: _you know_ [all] [that] _junk mail_ [you] [get] ? 
A|40| A: oh yes [i] sure [do] . 
B|41| B: [the] glossy paper [that] says buy _this_ [and] send [off] [for _that] and_ [you] [have] won [and] [all] [that .] 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [well] anytime [they] send me [a] _return_ envelope [i] [put] [all] [that] stuff back [in the] envelope plus [the] other stuff [that] [i] _you know_ happen [to] gather [up] . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] oh . 
B|45| B: [because] [uh] [well] [like] [i] say [we] live [a] way [and] when [you] throw trash away [you] throw [it] [in] my yard . 
A|46| A: yes . 
B|47| B: [and i] don't [like] [that] 
A|48| A: no . 
B|49| B: [so] [i] don't [do] [that [.] so] [i] [take] [it] [and i] send [and i] _mail_ [it] back [to] them . 
A|50| A: [well] great . [that's] excellent . 
B|51| B: _i've_ had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
A|52| A: [well] [uh] [if] [a] lot [of] people did [that] [then] [we] wouldn't [have] [a] lot [of] [this] [junk mail] . [that's] [a] great [idea] [. i] hadn't [thought] [about] [that and] [we] might [be] able [to incorporate] [some] [of] [that .] _one_ [thing] 
B|53| B: yeah . [well [i] think] [one] [of [the] the] best ways [to] eliminate [uh] [or] help [the] [recycling] [problem] [is] [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
A|54| A: [right .] 
B|55| B: [for] instance [uh] [i] saw [a] [thing] [on] [uh] nova [i think] [it] was [the] other day . 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [this] guy has designed [recyclable materials] [i] mean [recyclable] items . 
A|58| A: [right .] 
B|59| B: whatever he makes [it's] [all] [out] [of the] same [thing] . 
A|60| A: oh . 
B|61| B: [see] [so] [plastic] [it's] [all] [out] [of plastic] . 
A|62| A: yes . 
B|63| B: [if] [it's] metal [it's] [all] [out] [of] metal . [it's] he's [a] design he's [a] engineer designing stuff . 
A|64| A: [well] [that's] [a] great [idea] [that's] [a] great [idea] . 
B|65| B: [and] [and] incorporating _you know_ reusable [materials] into [your] _uh you know_ [your] assembly line into [your] actual scheme [of] product operations [is] [is] [the] [only] way [to] really [do] [it] [on a] [on a] broad scale . 
A|66| A: products . yes . 
B|67| B: make [it] financially [uh] attractive [to] recycle 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [and] somebody [will] find [a] way [to] make money _at_ [it .] 
A|70| A: yes [they] [will] . 
B|71| B: [and] 
A|72| A: exactly . 
B|73| B: [well] there [is] [a] guy [in] dallas [that's] [all] he does . 
A|74| A: huh . 
B|75| B: he collects trash [. _you] know_ [and] 
A|76| A: [well] [that's] [a] full time job . 
B|77| B: yeah [well] he's he's [out] [for] cardboard . 
A|78| A: yes [well] [i've] found [out] too [that] [uh you know] [a] couple years ago we've always been [recycling] newspaper [for] [the] last twelve years [and] [at] [one] time [we] could [get] [a] pretty good [return] [uh] [with] [the] boy scouts . [we] could [take] [and] collect [the] newspaper
