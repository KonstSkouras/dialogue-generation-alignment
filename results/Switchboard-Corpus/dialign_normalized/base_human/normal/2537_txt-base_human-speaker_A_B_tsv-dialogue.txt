A|0| A: okay . _well_ _how_ _do_ _you_ feel about _uh drug_ _testing_ ? 
B|1| B: _um_ personally _i don't_ _have_ _a_ _problem_ _with_ _it_ _uh _i_ think_ [uh] as far as [uh] protecting fellow employees protecting _their_ reputation _of_ _the company_ _and_ _the_ quality _of_ work _that_ _the_ _people_ [do] _um_ _it's_ justified . _on_ _the other_ hand _um_ _i_ [do] agree _that_ _it's it's_ _a_ _it's_ an invasion _of_ privacy as far as _a_ person's involvement outside _of_ work . 
A|2| A: _yeah ._ 
B|3| B: _um_ _i would_ never _i would_ never _have_ _a_ _problem_ _with_ anyone [testing] _me_ _but i_ _can_ understand why _people_ _would_ object . _so_ _i guess_ _uh _i_ guess_ [uh] i'm kind _of_ mixed _on_ _it_ still _at_ _this_ point . 
A|4| A: _yeah . i_ am _too_ _a little_ bit [i] mean _i i don't_ want _to_ _be_ _around_ _people who_ _are_ _really_ [on] drugs _and that_ sort [of] thing 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and _and_ _you_ know_ _obviously_ they're probably _not_ _going to_ _be_ doing _a good_ _job_ [and] [so] forth [but [i] don't] _really_ _like_ having _to do_ _it _._ it_ 
B|7| B: _that's_ _right ._ 
A|8| A: [and] [i don't] _like_ [the] idea _of _it_ [it's_ it's] makes _too_ _much_ _of _a_ big_ brother _type_ [of] thing . 
B|9| B: _that's_ absolutely _right [._ it] [it] _uh _i_ guess_ [it] _all_ comes _down_ [to] [uh] [you know] [a] [a] definition [of] [uh] [how] [much] _out_ outside activities _affect_ _your_ work [and] [uh] [uh] granted _you know that_ _any_ _any_ kind [of] [drug] use [on] [on] _company_ property [and] whatnot _is_ _is_ definitely [not] acceptable . 
A|10| A: _yeah ._ 
B|11| B: [uh] _uh _i_ don't think_ anybody _would_ ever argue [that] . _or_ [uh] _any_ _any_ after affects carrying over _into_ [the] workday 
A|12| A: huh-uh . 
B|13| B: [but] _um_ _you know [i_ don't] i'm [not] particularly concerned _with_ _what_ [people] [do] _um_ after _they_ leave _for_ [the] day especially _if [i_ don't] _if [i_ don't] [uh] see _any_ results [of it] [the] next day . 
A|14| A: _yeah yeah i think so_ _too ._ _but _you know_ it's_ one [of] _those_ _things_ . 
B|15| B: [well] [it] [it] _is_ [it] [you know] [on] _the other_ hand [you] you've _got_ [uh] you've _got_ [the] [uh] [the] possibility [of] [people] _oh_ you've _got_ _some_ [people] _could be_ arrested _for_ [uh drug] use [drug] dealings [and] [things] [like] [that] [and] [uh] _if_ _their_ _if_ _their_ employers name hits [the] papers [and that] [it's [it's] it's] [a] mark against _them_ 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: _the company_ [and] [uh] _you know what_ kind [of] [people] work there _what_ [uh] 
A|18| A: plus [i guess] _if they_ _are_ _in_ [problem] _enough_ [to] [be] jailed [or] _something_ [of] [that] nature [for] [any] length [of] time then [the company] _has_ lost [what] _they've_ put [into] [that] employee [and] [their] expertise _or whatever_ . 
B|19| B: _that's_ _right ._ _that's_ _right ._ _right ._ even [if] [it] _is_ [you know] [a] [company] policy [of] [uh] immediate termination [or whatever] [they] still _have_ [to] replace _them_ . 
A|20| A: _yeah ._ 
B|21| B: [and] [uh] there's there's [a] lot involved there . 
A|22| A: [well] [do] [you] _think _that_ _um_ it_ _should_ [be] [like] _we have_ [this] sort [of] random spot [testing] _type_ [of] thing [or] [do] [you] [think] [it] _would be_ more palatable [if] _we_ _had some_ sort [of] _regular schedule_ [or] [would] [that] _just_ allow _everybody_ [a] chance _to _get_ out of it_ ? 
B|23| B: [i think] [i think] [the] [regular schedule] stuff [um] [that] when [you] _say_ [everybody] [get out of it] _that's_ [a good] point [i] never [really] _thought_ [of it] [that] _way ._ 
A|24| A: [well] _you know if_ _if they_ [have] time _enough_ [they] [can] stay off [of _it] ._ 
B|25| B: [yeah] [if they] [really] [can] [um] [i think] _the the_ biggest [problem] i've _got_ _is_ _is_ forcing [it] [on] someone after [they've] already agreed _to the_ terms [of] employment . 
A|26| A: _yeah ._ 
B|27| B: [um] as far as [the] new hires [i i] hired [on] [just] early [enough] [that] [i i] missed [it .] [um] where [the] new hires _were_ concerned _but uh_ [not] nobody _no_ _i don't think_ anybody questions [that um] [testing] someone as [a] as [a] precondition [to] being hired [but] [um] [for] [the] conditions [that] [for] our employment [to] change while you're [on] [the] [job] _that's_ [i i don't] _know that_ _that's_ where _i think that_ most [people] [get] upset . [it's] [uh] [you know] [it it's] changing [the] rules _in the_ middle [of] [the] game basically [and] [uh] [it's] [just] [it it's] [a] [really] tough question 
A|28| A: _yeah ._ 
B|29| B: [and] [it] [you know] [it] [people] [have] [have] [really] _quieted down_ after everything started [but i] still [think] there's [a] lot [of] there's [a] lot [of] resentment . 
A|30| A: _i think so_ _too_ [uh _i] _know_ [the_ the] group _i was_ [in] [at] [the] time [this] [all] came _up_ [they] [uh] [were] _quite_ vocal about [it] through electronic mail boy [they] _just really_ [you know] let [them] [have] [it] _from_ one end [to [the] other] vehemently 
B|31| B: _uh-huh ._ [you] bet . 
A|32| A: [but _uh] it_ _has_ [quieted down] [but [i] don't think] [they] probably feel [any] differently 
B|33| B: _no_ _that's_ _right ._ 
A|34| A: [and] [some] [some] [of] [them] _did_ quit [the _company] ._ 
B|35| B: [yeah [i] [i] know] [of] [some] [people who] [did] [uh _it] was_ _it was_ indirectly related [you know] [they] _could_ always come _up with_ [other] reasons [but] [it] [it] [had] [a] lot [to do] _with_ [it .] [just] [the _the] whole_ attitude because [it's] [really] [uh] [it's] [just really] [it] [it] seems [so] t [i] [you know] _with [the_ _the] whole_ relaxed atmosphere [that] [we have] [um] [to] [all] [of a] sudden [uh] search [for] attitudes [and] whatnot . 
A|36| A: true . 
B|37| B: [you know] there's [not] [a] lot [of] pressure _to to_ vote [the] _right_ _way_ [or] _anything_ else [around] t [i] . [like] there [like] there _is_ [in] [some] companies [or] [at] least [you know] [from] [what] i've heard 
A|38| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [but uh] [yeah] 
A|40| A: [yeah i] _wouldn't_ [like] [anything] [of] [that] nature [you know] 
B|41| B: [uh-huh _.] no_ [i] 
A|42| A: [don't] tell [me] [what] [to do] [you know] . 
B|43| B: absolutely [not] [you know [it's] [it's] it's] [you know if] [you] hired [me] i'll [be] [you know] supposedly _your_ grade [was] [a little] majority [of] my views [and] my qualifications [to] begin _with_ [so] [uh] [you know] _let's_ _let's_ stick _with_ [that] original trust [i guess] . 
A|44| A: _yeah ._ 
B|45| B: [but uh] [it's it's] still [it] [it] still remains [a] tough question [and] [it's] there's [a] lot [of] [you [know] _the] whole_ _the whole_ department [of] defense [uh] reasoning behind [the] original plan [and] whatnot . there's [a] lot [of] different [things] _that uh_ come [into] play [but] [that] [was] [i think] [everybody] [everybody] pretty [much] knows [that] [that] [was] kind [of a] smoke screen [to] implement [it] throughout _the whole_ [company .] 
A|46| A: _yeah ._ [well] [i guess] _too_ [if i] [thought] [that] [this] [would] _help_ [really] [and] truly [do] away [with the] [drug] [problem] then [that] _would be_ one thing . [but [i] think] [it's] _too_ minor [and] _too_ [you know] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [in] [in [the] whole] scope _of things_ [this] isn't _going [to_ to] [have] [any] real [affect] [on] what's _going_ [on] [in the] street . 
B|49| B: [i] [really] [don't [think] so] . [yeah . i] [really] [don't] because [some] [people] [are] [going to] [are] [are] [going to] risk [it] [um it] may prevent [i [i] guess] [i guess] [what] i'm trying [to get] [at] _is_ [if] [it] [if] [it] [if] [it] does [help] [a] few individuals maybe maybe [it's] worth [it .] 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [um] [you know] [it] may prevent somebody [who] [was] [was] teetering [on] [the] edge [of] experimenting [or] whatnot [but [uh] [i] don't] [know if] [you [know] the] [it's it's] [a] needs [of] [the] few [and] [the] needs [of] [the] many [type] situation [i don't] [know if] [everybody] [should] [have] [to] sacrifice [quite] as [much] . there there's still [a big] question [in] my mind [that] [the the] absolute refusal [to] accept [the] possibility [of] [of] mistakes [on] [the] [testing] _is_ [something] [that] still bothers [me] . 
A|52| A: [well] yes . 
B|53| B: [it it's] 
A|54| A: [that] yes [. _i] [i think_ that] [could be] [a big] [problem] [you know [i] would] [just] [be] irate [if they] said [it was] _positive and_ [i] knew [it] wasn't 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [you know that] [just really] rubbed [me] [the] wrong [way .] 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] absolutely . [and that] [i i don't] [know if] [uh [i] don't] [know if] [everybody] understands [all] [the] implications [on] [that] [too .] even [if] [you] [you know if] _you take_ [uh] [a] [a] [drug] [that] [was] prescribed [for] [you] [but] [the the] prescription [has] run [out] [you] still [had some] left [and you] happen [to] _take_ an extra penicillin [well] penicillin's [not] [on] [the] list [but you know] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [yeah [i] i think] [you] understand [what] i'm getting [at] 
A|60| A: [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [it] [it] [can] still show [up] [and] [it] [can] still flag as [a] [positive [and] and] [those] kinds [of things] [obviously] _that's not_ [the] intent 
A|62| A: [right [.] no] . 
B|63| B: [and] [uh] [those] [are] [the] kinds [of things] [that] still [can] show [up] . 
A|64| A: [i guess] [the] one [that] [really] [got] [me] [too] [was] [that uh] [let's] [say] [your] spouse [is] [on] [a] particular [drug] [and [you] know what] [that] [is] 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [and] then [you] end [up [with] the] same [problem] [and [you] take] [their] leftover _medicine_ [that's not] allowed . 
B|67| B: [that's] [right .] 
A|68| A: [you know] [that's] [that's] totally [out] . 
B|69| B: [that's] [right [.] i] even [had] friends when [i was] [going to] college [who] [were] [in] [uh] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally [um] provide [medicine] [to] [their] family family members [and] friends certain medicines [were] [were] legal now [i [i] i] believe [you know] [any] [of] [the] [any] [of] [the] ones [we] [would] [we] [would be] tested [for] [wouldn't] [be] [on] [those] lists 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but uh] [um] there [were] certain [things] [that] [they] [could] provide without [a] doctors prescription based [on] [their] qualifications [and that] [can] happen . 
A|72| A: [oh] [that's] interesting . 
B|73| B: [but uh] 
A|74| A: [well] [i guess] we've exhausted [that] one . 
B|75| B: [yeah yeah i think so] 
A|76| A: enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|77| B: [you] [too .] 
A|78| A: _good-bye ._
