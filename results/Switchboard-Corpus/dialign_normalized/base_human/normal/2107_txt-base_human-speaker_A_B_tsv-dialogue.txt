B|13| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: _and it_ _started_ raining _and _i_ was_ _hysterical_ _. _i_ was_ [, _i] was_ _, i mean [,_ you] would [have] thought [a] _child_ _had_ _died ._ 
B|15| B: [yes ,] _uh-huh ._

A|18| A: _and they_ laughed _at_ me _, they_ thought _that _was_ so_ _hysterical_ . 
B|19| B: _oh no_ [, i] understand _, we_ [, uh ,] we've gone _through_ _the same_ _things_ _with_ ours , we've _had [,_ you know ,] they've [been] ill [, i mean] [i] _take_ [off] work , _to _take_ care _of_ [my_ _cats] [,_ you know ,] 
A|20| A: _oh _yeah_ ._ 
B|21| B: [my] boss thinks i'm absolutely _crazy _._ and_ then _we_ _had a_ baby [and] _it's [like_ ,] _all_ _right_ _who_ comes [first] _the cat_ _or_ [the] baby . 
A|22| A: [the cat] _was_ _here_ [first] [so] _i _know ,_ it's_ hard . 
B|23| B: _and _,_ and_ then _when_ _we_ _go_ _to_ sleep [at] night [, you [know ,] _it's] like_ [my] husband [and _i] _have_ to_ try _to get_ _any_ space _on the_ bed _because_ _we have_ _all_ [four] _of _them_ up_ _there_ _with_ us . 
A|24| A: _oh ,_ how funny . 
B|25| B: _it's like_ _all_ _right_ , whose corners _is_ _this one_ . 
A|26| A: _that's_ sweet [, i have] _the _two_ _,_ _the_ other two cats_ [i have] _are_ _outdoor [cats_ .] 
B|27| B: [oh ,] _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: _and they_ _didn't_ used _to be_ actually _, but_ [they] _got_ kind [of] wild [and] weren't doing _very_ [well] inside , [so] [i] _put_ [them] _outside_ once _i got_ [a] _house_ [and] _they're_ doing great _out_ [there] _, they_ _love_ _it _._ but_ _the other_ [one] _, the_ [first] [one] _i got_ _he_ doesn't want anything [to] _do_ [with] _outside_ unless you're _there ._ 
B|29| B: [oh ,] _uh-huh ._ 
A|30| A: _other_ _than_ _that_ _he_ gets scared _to death ._ _if_ [you] shut _that_ door _he_ goes into hiding . 
B|31| B: _oh no ._ 
A|32| A: [i] think [it's] [from] [the] _time_ _he_ jumped [off] [the] balcony 
B|33| B: [yes ,] _uh-huh_ _, that's_ [it] 
A|34| A: [and] lord knows _what_ happened [to] _him ._ _he's_ probably [been] [through] [all] kinds [of] nightmares . 
B|35| B: _right_ , traumatized [for] _life_ [here] . 
A|36| A: probably . 
B|37| B: _oh yeah ,_ we've , [all] [four] [of] ours [are] [house] [cats .] 
A|38| A: [are] [they] . 
B|39| B: _we_ [started] [out] [with] [two ,] [with] [two] [outdoor cats] [but] our neighbor decided [he] [didn't] _like cats_ [and] shot _one of _them_ ._ 
A|40| A: [oh no .] 
B|41| B: _oh well_ [he] _lived_ [through] _it _,_ _oh_ , i_ couldn't believe [it .] _we_ went [through] [like] twenty-two hundred dollars worth [of] _vet_ bills . 
A|42| A: [oh] [my] gosh . 
B|43| B: [the] [, [the] cat] almost [died] _, and_ _but he_ turned [out] [to be] such [a] wonderful _cat _,_ oh_ [he] loves _life_ _now_ . 
A|44| A: [oh , i] imagine . 
B|45| B: [and] [he's] [like] [oh ,] thank [you] [so] much . 
A|46| A: [i] wonder how many [of] his lives [he] missed , [when] _that_ happened . 
B|47| B: [i know _,] we_ wondered _about_ _that [._ but] [, uh _,] oh_ [that was] [a] traumatic experience [for] us _too ._ 
A|48| A: [oh , i] _can_ imagine , _what_ _did_ [he] shoot _him with_ . 
B|49| B: [uh ,] _well [,_ uh ,] [from] [what] _we_ _can tell_ _it was_ [a] pellet gun [and] then [he] [started] chasing [him with] [a] bull whip . 
A|50| A: [oh] [my] gosh . people [are] [crazy .] 
B|51| B: [oh yes ,] absolutely nuts [. but] [, uh ,] luckily enough [, you know _,] we_ _found_ [the cat] [in] [time] _and , uh ,_ rushed [him] [to] _the vet_ [and _it] took_ us _about_ six _weeks_ [of] [in] [and] [out] _of _the_ vet_ [and] surgery _and ,_ 
A|52| A: [oh] lord . 
B|53| B: [i mean] [he] [started] [off] _as_ [a] stray [and] then _we_ [did] [all] [this] _for him_ 
A|54| A: [oh] man . 
B|55| B: [but] [oh _,] he's_ [been] [a] wonderful [cat .] 
A|56| A: [i] imagine _. they_ usually [are] after _something_ [like] [that] _happens [to_ them .] [it] seems [to] mellow [them] [or] _something_ . 
B|57| B: [oh yes] [. but] [, uh _,] we_ _wouldn't_ _we_ _wouldn't have_ [them] [, i mean [,] _i] don't_ _see_ us without pets , without [cats .] 
A|58| A: [no .] 
B|59| B: there's _just [,_ uh ,] there's [this] [, _they] just_ fill [this] void . 
A|60| A: [oh yeah [,] i] [i] _keep_ _talking_ [about] _getting rid [of_ my] [outdoor cats] [because] [i] feel [like] [i don't] [, i] _can't [take_ _care of] them_ [as] [well] [because] _they're_ _outside ,_ 
B|61| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|62| A: [and it] worries me [that] [one] day [one of them] won't _come_ _back_ , 
B|63| B: [yes] . 
A|64| A: [and i] feel [like] [they] _need_ [a] big _home ,_ [a] _nice_ place where someone [can] [have] [the] [time] [to] _play_ _with them_ [and] [things] [. but] [i] _can't_ give [them up] . 
B|65| B: [oh no .] 
A|66| A: [i] [just [,] i] [go] _hysterical_ [when] [they] [don't] _come_ _home_ . 
B|67| B: _right_ _and you_ worry [about] _, [oh_ ,] who's taking [care of [them] .] 
A|68| A: [oh [,] [oh] yeah [,] and] every [time] [you] [see] [one] hit [on the] side [of the] road [you] say [is] [that] [my] [cat .] 
B|69| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|70| A: [and you] [go] [crazy] thinking [it] might [be] yours . 
B|71| B: _right_ , [well] [i] [didn't] _realize_ [my] husband [was] such [a] sucker [for] animals until [i] brought [one] [home] [one] night . _we_ [, i had] _one that_ _had _,_ we_ _had _,_ we_ _had to_ [put] [to] sleep [he] [got] [so] sick . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: _and , uh ,_ [well] [i] fell [in] [love] [with] [this] [, uh [,] it's] [a] chinchilla persian [, _and] , uh ,_ brought [him] [home ,] 
A|74| A: ugh ! 
B|75| B: [and] [oh _,] my_ husband [just] [died .] 
A|76| A: _really_ . 
B|77| B: _it was_ [like] _we_ [can't take] [it] [back] you've _got ,_ we've [got] _to keep it_ _now_ . 
A|78| A: [it's] [here] [now] _, we [have_ [to] keep [it] .] [yeah [,] my] [, my] [first] [one that] _i [got_ [,] i had] [just] _moved_ away [from] [home] [and] [got] [my] own apartment . [it took] me [about] [two] [weeks] [to] [realize] , [that was] real lonely . 
B|79| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh] , [yes] . 
A|80| A: [so] [i] [found] [this _one] [and ,_ uh ,] actually [it was] [on] [a] sign [at] taco bell drive-thru [that] _said_ free kittens . 
B|81| B: [oh] [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [and i] thought [well] [that's] interesting , i'll call [them .] 
B|83| B: _right ._ 
A|84| A: [and] _he was_ [the] only [one] left [and] his _mother_ [had] [been] killed coming [back] across [the] road [to] make sure she'd gotten [all] _her_ kittens . 
B|85| B: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [and] _he was_ [the] last [one] _she_ carried across [, you know _,] the whole_ big sad story . 
B|87| B: _oh ._ 
A|88| A: [so] [of] course [, i [had] [to] take] _him . i_ felt [so] _sorry_ [for him] after [that .] 
B|89| B: _right_ _, right ._ 
A|90| A: [and] [he] [is] _, uh , you_ [can tell] _he was_ weaned [too] young [because] he'll nurse [on] _your_ ears [and] _your_ fingers . 
B|91| B: [oh no .] 
A|92| A: [yeah ,] [he] [, _i] asked_ [the vet] why [he] [did] [that] [and] [he] _said_ _he was_ probably weaned [too] young , _which_ _he was_ , [because] his mom [was] killed , [so] . 
B|93| B: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [but he] [is] [the] lovingest [cat .] everybody , people [who] [don't] even _like cats ,_ [like] _him ._ 
B|95| B: _oh ._ 
A|96| A: [he] _never_ meows , [he] , [he] doesn't [have] [any] front _claws_ [, i had] [him] declawed , 
B|97| B: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [but he] doesn't bite anybody [he's] [just [,] he's] [just] kind [of] [there] , real friendly [and] docile . 
B|99| B: [oh] [that's] _good_ . [oh] [we] [just [,] uh ,] _just _love_ [them_ [.] they] [, uh [, you] know ,] _get_ [to] feeling [so] lovey [and] dovey [and] they'll [come] _up and_ [just] start _kneading_ [in] our chest [and] _it's like_ [oh ,] [your] [claws] [need] trimming . 
A|100| A: [oh yeah _,] [yeah_ [,] we] _do_ [, we] call [that] doing biscuits , 
B|101| B: [oh yes ,] [yes] . 
A|102| A: "it looks [like] their [kneading] bread *spelling ""their"" should [be] ""they're""" 
B|103| B: [oh] [it] [just] drives us nuts . 
A|104| A: [oh , i] [just love] [cats _.] i_ [like] _dogs_ _, they're_ [okay [,] i [had] [,] i [had] _a] dog_ _when i_ [lived] [at] [home] 
B|105| B: um [, [yeah] .] 
A|106| A: [but] _they're_ [a] lot _more_ trouble _than_ [cats] actually . 
B|107| B: [they] [really] _are ._ [the] _cats are_ [so] independent [and they] [have] [so] much [more] personality [than] [a dog] . 
A|108| A: [oh yeah [,] they] _do_ . 
B|109| B: [and [,] but] [oh [,] they're] [so] much fun [to] _watch_ [them] [play] . 
A|110| A: [oh] [they] [are _.] i_ [love] [it [,] it's] [so] funny [to get] [more] [than] [one] [cat] together , [because] [it] brings [out] their personalities .
