A|0| A: _think_ about _uh _taxes_ ._ 
B|1| B: _well_ _i think_ _they're_ _a_ necessary evil . _uh i_ wish _the_ government would operate on _the_ same premise _that_ [uh] businesses operate on _and_ _that_ _is_ [uh] _you_ _you_ _don't_ _spend_ _more_ than _you_ than _you_ bring _in_ . 
A|2| A: [you] [spend] _what_ [you] _have_ [and] _yeah_ [i _think] _that_ the_ general idea [is] _to_ _you know_ [spend] [uh] during [a] _time_ _of_ recession _that _you_ know_ _for the_ deficit spending _to_ help pick _up_ [the] economy _but_ [they're] running under [the] _you know_ [the] way [they're] running _it_ _now_ [they're] _you know_ running _it_ under [a] deficit spending _you know_ while we're _not_ under [a] recession _so_ _there's_ never _any_ surplus coming [in] _to_ counter [the] deficit [that] we're running _so_ that's kind _of a_ basic thing _of_ economics [i] guess keep spending keep _going_ _into_ debt _you're _not_ going to_ payoff _what_ [you] owe _but_ _so i_ guess [the] [the] question _was_ [more] _like_ [uh] _do you_ get _what_ _you pay_ _you know_ get _what_ _you pay_ _for_ . 
B|3| B: _well_ [i] [it] just depends . [uh] [uh] roads are very expensive [uh] commodity _and so_ [is] [uh] utilities _they_ supply [and] police [and] fire department [uh] [you know] _they_ _need_ [to] _make a_ living . 
A|4| A: _yeah_ . _there's_ 
B|5| B: [so [i] think] [for] [for] [for] many years [uh] we've paid teachers [and] police officers [and] firemen who are [uh] _to a_ great extent public servants [uh] we [have] [not] paid them really [what] [they're] worth [in] [what] _they_ contribute [to] society . 
A|6| A: uh-huh . [i] agree _with_ [that] . 
B|7| B: _but uh_ then again [uh] it's [the] hard [to] justify _with all the_ wastefulness _of money_ [that the] government spends on _all_ levels [of] [of] [uh] government including municipalities as _well_ as _state_ [and] federal governments . 
A|8| A: [i] guess _i'm_ _i'm_ [a] student right _now_ _and i_ [don't] [make a] whole _lot [of_ _money] [and_ [so] i] [i] kind [of] [don't] _pay a_ proportionate _amount_ _of taxes_ [to] [i] guess [uh] compared [to] _what i_ get because [i] [you know] [all] _my_ _my_ education [is] [state] sponsored . [i] go [to a] [state] sponsored school _and uh_ _my_ education _all up_ through high school [and] stuff [so i] guess _i'm_ kind [of] [in] debt [i] [i] suppose because [i] [don't] [you know] been _paying taxes_ [all] [that] [all] [that] long . _my_ parents [i] guess however [have] contributed [to] _that [you_ know] _for the_ education side [of] [it] _and everything_ [but [uh] i] usually end _up_ getting [money] back . [i] will _this_ _year_ anyway from [a] 
B|9| B: [uh] [you're] very fortunate . 
A|10| A: _yeah_ [i] am [i] [need] [it] too otherwise 
B|11| B: we just try [not] [to] [pay] [any] [more] [in] than we [have] [to] [uh] we [pay] [in] [a] substantial [amount] . [uh] 
A|12| A: uh-huh . 
B|13| B: we [don't] regret [paying [taxes] .] we [do] [think that] [uh] sometimes [uh] we [have] [a] reverse [of a] regressive _tax_ [a] progressive _tax_ . 
A|14| A: uh-huh . 
B|15| B: [and] progressive _tax_ [i think] [uh] does [not] give _people_ incentive [to] [make] [more] [money and] [what i] mean by [that the] [more] _income_ [you] [make] [the] [more] _tax_ _you pay ._ 
A|16| A: [more] _taxes [you pay_ .] 
B|17| B: [it] should be _i think a flat percentage_ [and uh] [that] _percentage_ ought [to] be an equitable [amount] . 
A|18| A: uh-huh . isn't 
B|19| B: [uh] last [year] when _they_ passed _the tax_ laws [for the] [uh] nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one [uh i] added [up] _all _the_ taxes that_ we were [going to] [pay] on [all] these different specific luxury items [and] travel expenses [and everything] else 
A|20| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|21| B: [and i] totaled them [all up] [and] basically [uh] we were [going to] be [paying] seventy _or_ eighty percent _tax_ . 
A|22| A: wow . 
B|23| B: [now] [that] _was the_ assumption [that you] spent [that] same dollar [for] every [for] every item on _there_ even though [there's] [uh taxes] on different things . 
A|24| A: uh-huh . [well] isn't 
B|25| B: [but] [you know] [there's] _there's a [lot_ [of] [taxes] you pay] [that] [you're not] even aware [of] [that] [you're] [paying] [uh] [like] when [you] buy [a] tire [you [pay] a] federal excise _tax_ . 
A|26| A: uh-huh [there's a lot] _yeah_ [lot of] hidden [taxes .] 
B|27| B: [you pay] gasoline [taxes] every [time] [you] pump _something_ [into] your your tank . 
A|28| A: uh-huh . [the taxes that] [people] [don't] [think] about [that] _yeah_ [the] [the] [the] [income] [tax] [is] [a lot] [more] visible portion [of] [the [taxes] you pay] [i] guess . 
B|29| B: [but] [you] probably [pay] [more] _percentage_ wise [in] other [taxes .] 
A|30| A: uh-huh . [there] [was] [that] which [was] [it] jerry brown one [of] [the] democratic candidates had [a] proposal [for] doing away [with all the] [the tax] codes [they] [have] [now] [and] implementing [a] [i think a flat percentage] [something] [like] [that] . 
B|31| B: [yeah] if [you] implemented [a flat percentage] [it] would encourage [people] [uh] [to] [make] [more] [money and] [the] [what] [people] [need] [to] understand [in] [my] opinion [now] [this] [is] just [my] opinion okay [uh] [is] [that] businesses create jobs [and] jobs create [income] [and] [income] pays [taxes .] 
A|32| A: uh-huh . 
B|33| B: [and so] if [they] penalize businesses business [people] are smart enough [to] say here's [my] break point [i'm] [not going to] work [any] harder [and] [make] [any] [more] _or_ create [any] [more] jobs . 
A|34| A: right . exactly . that's because until [like] eight 
B|35| B: [and so] based on [that] who [do you] [think] [you're] talking [to] [you're] talking [to] an employer . 
A|36| A: [up] until [like] eighty-five [or] [something] [was the]
