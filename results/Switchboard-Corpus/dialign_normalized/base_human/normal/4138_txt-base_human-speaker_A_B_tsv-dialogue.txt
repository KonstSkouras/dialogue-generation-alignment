A|4| A: _yeah_ . _there's ,_ 
B|5| B: _so [i_ think] [for] [, for] [, for] many years [, uh ,] we've paid teachers [and] police officers [and] firemen who are [, uh ,] _to a_ great extent , public servants [uh ,] we [have] [not] paid them really [what] [they're] worth [in] [what] _they_ contribute [to] society .

A|8| A: [i] guess _, i'm_ _, i'm_ [a] student right _now_ _and i_ [don't] [make a] whole _lot [of_ _money] _and_ , so [,_ i [,] i] kind [of] [don't] _pay a_ proportionate _amount_ _of taxes_ _to [,_ i] guess [, uh ,] compared [to] _what i_ get , because [i [,] you know ,] [all] _my_ , _my_ education [is] [state] sponsored . [i] go [to a] [state] sponsored school _and , uh ,_ _my_ education _all up_ through high school [and] stuff _, [so_ i] guess _i'm_ kind [of] [in] debt [, i [,] i] suppose , because [i] [don't] [, you know ,] been _paying taxes_ [all] [that ,] [all] [that] long . _my_ parents [, i] guess , however , [have] contributed [to] [that [,] you know [,] _for] the_ education side [of] [it] _and everything_ , [but , [uh ,] i] usually end _up_ getting [money] back .

B|13| B: we [don't] regret [paying [taxes] .] we [do] [think that [,] uh ,] sometimes [, uh ,] we [have] [a] reverse [of a] regressive _tax_ , [a] progressive _tax_ . 
A|14| A: uh-huh . 
B|15| B: [and] progressive _tax_ [, i think] [, uh ,] does [not] give _people_ incentive [to] [make] [more] [money] , [and] [what i] mean by [that , the] [more] _income_ [you] [make] [, the] [more] _tax_ _you pay ._ 
A|16| A: [more] _taxes [you pay_ .] 
B|17| B: [it] should be [, i think] , _a flat percentage_ [and , uh ,] [that] _percentage_ ought [to] be an equitable [amount] . 
A|18| A: uh-huh . isn't , 
B|19| B: [uh ,] last [year] when _they_ passed _the tax_ laws [for [the] [,] uh ,] nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one [uh , i] added [up] _all _the_ taxes that_ we were [going to] [pay] on [all] these different specific luxury items [and] travel expenses [and everything] else , 
A|20| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|21| B: [and i] totaled them [all up] [and] basically [, uh ,] we were [going to] be [paying] seventy _or_ eighty percent _tax_ . 
A|22| A: wow . 
B|23| B: [now ,] [that] _was the_ assumption [that] [you] spent [that] same dollar [for] every [, for] every item on _there_ even though [there's [,] uh , taxes] on different things . 
A|24| A: uh-huh . [well] isn't , 
B|25| B: [but [,] you know _,] there's_ _there's a [lot_ [of] [taxes] you pay] [that] [you're not] even aware [of] [that] [you're] [paying] [, uh _,] like_ when [you] buy [a] tire [, [you] [pay] a] federal excise _tax_ . 
A|26| A: uh-huh [, [there's] a lot] , _yeah_ , [lot of] hidden [taxes .] 
B|27| B: [you pay] gasoline [taxes] every [time] [you] pump _something_ [into] your , your tank . 
A|28| A: uh-huh . [the taxes that] [people] [don't] [think] about [that ,] _yeah_ [, [the] [,] [the] [,] the] [income] [tax] [is] [a lot] [more] visible portion [of] [the [taxes] you pay] [, i] guess . 
B|29| B: [but] [you] probably [pay] [more] _percentage_ wise [in] other [taxes .] 
A|30| A: uh-huh . [there] [was] [that ,] which [was] [it] jerry brown , one [of] [the] democratic candidates had [a] proposal [for] doing away [with all [the] [,] [the] tax] codes [they] [have] [now] [and] implementing [a] [i think] _a flat percentage ,_ [something] [like] [that] . 
B|31| B: [yeah] if [you] implemented [a flat percentage ,] [it] would encourage [people] [, uh ,] [to] [make] [more] [money and] [the ,] [what] [people] [need] [to] understand [in] [my] opinion , [now] [this] [is] just [my] opinion , okay [, uh ,] [is] [that] businesses create jobs [and] jobs create [income] [and] [income] pays [taxes .] 
A|32| A: uh-huh . 
B|33| B: [and , so ,] if [they] penalize businesses , business [people] are smart enough [to] say , here's [my] break point [, i'm] [not going to] work [any] harder [and] [make] [any] [more] _or_ create [any] [more] jobs . 
A|34| A: right . exactly . that's , because until [, like] eight , 
B|35| B: [and] [so ,] based on [that ,] who [do you] [think] [you're] talking [to [,] you're] talking [to] an employer .
