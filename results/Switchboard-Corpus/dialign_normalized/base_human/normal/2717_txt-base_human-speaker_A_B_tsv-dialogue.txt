A|0| A: i'll _let_ _you_ _go_ _first_ . 
B|1| B: _oh_ _well_ _what's_ _there_ _to_ say ? doesn't seem _like_ _it's_ _being_ carried _out_ _very_ _well_ _in_ _my_ opinion . _seems _like_ it_ takes _so_ long _between_ conviction _and_ carrying _out_ _the_ _penalty_ _that _i_ don't see_ _that _it_ makes_ any _difference_ _to_ sentence anybody . 
A|2| A: _yeah_ [it] [seems like] _they_ could die _of_ old age waiting _to get_ _the death penalty_ . 
B|3| B: _yeah ._ 
A|4| A: [yeah] [i] _know_ _what_ _you_ _mean_ . _um_ [i] [in] _maryland_ _they_ _they_ _do_ _have_ _capital punishment_ 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: [and] _uh_ _i've_ seen _uh_ _a lot _of_ people_ _get_ convicted sentenced [and] _then_ _just_ nothing happens _just_ endless endless endless _appeals_ . 
B|7| B: _yeah ._ _uh-huh_ _well_ _from what_ [i] [i] saw [a] statistic [just] _a few_ _days_ ago [um] _so far this year_ _or_ _was_ [it] _during the_ _last_ _year_ _during a_ year's _time_ _i think it was_ [they] executed twenty-five _people _in_ the_ nation . meanwhile _there_ _were_ twenty-five _hundred_ _people _on_ death row_ . _so_ [i] [i] [and] _it's_ building _up_ _you know they're they're_ _convicting_ _them_ faster _than_ _they're_ _executing them_ _so_ _it's_ really building _up_ . 
A|8| A: [yeah] [what's] amazing _is_ some _of_ [them] _have _been_ [on_ death row] _for_ [a] number _of_ years . 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [and] _uh_ _here_ [in] _maryland_ [i] _know we_ _have_ [a] real problem _with_ overcrowding [in] prisons _uh_ [just] 
B|11| B: [yeah] everybody's _got_ _that_ . 
A|12| A: [yeah] _but_ _i mean_ [in] _here_ [it's] _uh_ [to] [the] point _where_ [they] [were] letting prisoners _go_ _. uh_ commuting [the] sentences _of_ those [that] [were] [in] [in] jail _for_ lesser _crimes_ [in] order _to put_ _more_ [people in] into [the] jails . 
B|13| B: _uh-huh _._ _yeah_ ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: [and] [it was] [just] _uh_ amazing [to] me [and] _of_ course [they] made [a] big deal _out _of_ _the_ the_ [few] [that] [got] [out] [and] turned around [and] committed _a crime_ within five [days] _of_ _getting_ [out] [and] [being] rearrested _an_ . 
B|15| B: _yeah ._ isn't isn't [maryland] [where] [the] famous willy horton _case_ [was] . 
A|16| A: _uh i_ can't _remember ._ refresh [my] memory . 
B|17| B: [it _was] _uh_ that_ [was] [the] one [that] [was] used _so_ _much_ _in the_ campaign . _in the_ _in the_ presidential race [. uh] _may_ [it] _may_ _not_ [have been] [maryland] . [it] _may have been_ massachusetts _i don't [remember_ .] 
A|18| A: [um] [i don't remember] myself . 
B|19| B: anyway _well_ [the] question [is] _you know_ [do] [you] _think it_ does _make a difference_ [in] _whether_ _or not_ [a] criminal commits [a crime] _or_ [do] [you] _think it_ can _if_ [it's] done _right_ ? 
A|20| A: [um] [i think] [if] [they] [if] [they] _started_ [executing them] _on a_ regular basis [uh [that] [i] think it] might [make a difference] . [right] _now_ [i don't see] [it] _making_ [a difference] . 
B|21| B: [if] [it] 
A|22| A: [i don't see] _someone_ _not going_ [out] [there] [and] committing murder _because_ [they're] afraid _they're going to get_ sentenced _to death_ _. i mean_ _most_ [people] [out] [there] committing _murders_ _don't care_ . 
B|23| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|24| A: [they] [just] _don't care_ . 
B|25| B: _yeah ._ _well_ [i think] [in] large measure [the] reason [they] [don't care] [it's] [not] [because] [the] [punishment] [but] _so_ many [of the] [people] [that] _commit_ [crimes] [don't] [get] punished . 
A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: [the] police [don't] _catch_ [them] _or_ [the] courts [don't] convict [them] _or_ _or_ [they] [don't] serve _very_ _much_ [of the] _time_ _and so_ _uh you know_ their their success rate [is] _very_ high . [crime] does pay [you] can [make a] _good_ living at _it ._ 
A|28| A: [yeah] _yeah and_ _there's_ [uh] _there's_ _a lot _of_ people_ _here_ [in] _baltimore_ [that] [uh] [have] _and we_ [just] _had_ [uh] [a] real big cocaine bust [and] [of] course [you know they're they're] playing [it] [up] real big [that [it] was] looked [like [it] was] [a] [very] [very] small ring [and] [they] [just] _happened_ _to get_ lucky [and] [catch] _the guy_ . 
B|29| B: [yeah .] 
A|30| A: [but] _i mean_ [uh] _baltimore_ has [uh] _an_ _all_ [time] record _for the_ number [of] deaths [so far this year] _. [i_ think] _they've_ [got] over [a] [hundred] dead already [this year] . 
B|31| B: _last_ [year] [it was] d c [i] guess [baltimore] _caught_ [them] . 
A|32| A: [well] [it's] _kind of_ [it's] _kind of_ moved [up] _and you have to_ [remember] [that it] [it] [it] [uh] _there's_ [i think] x number _of people_ [out] [there] [that] _are_ _going to_ [commit] _murders_ 
B|33| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|34| A: [and] [uh] once [you] kill off [a few] [of] [them] 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: _i mean_ [if] [you] murder [a] _guy_ [because] he murdered _your_ partner [or] something [like] [that _i] mean_ pretty soon [you] run _out _of_ people_ [to] murder . 
B|37| B: [yeah] [the] only consolation [is] [so] many [of the] [murders] [are] [you know] [the the] violent [people] [going] against each _other_ _and so they_ [you know] society's [not [going] [to] put] [them] [to death] [well] at least maybe [the guy] [they] cross next [time] [is] [going to] [. _uh] i think_ [i think] [capital punishment] [is] [an] appropriate [punishment] [for the] [kind [of] people] [where] [we] say [you know] [this] sort _of person_ [is] [just] [not] acceptable [to] our society [and we] [are] [there] by [going to] remove [them] _from_ society [not] temporarily [but] permanently . 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [i mean] [i] [i] personally [think] life imprisonment [i don't] [think] _much_ [of] [of] life imprisonment . [first] [of] [all] [it's] never turns _out to be_ life [but] second [you know] why should [we] [the] idea [of] life imprisonment [with] _no_ chance [of] parole . [well] [that] means _you're_ [going [to] put] [them] _in a_ cage [you] [think] [it's] never ever _going to be_ safe [for] [them] [to] walk [the] streets again [well] [then] why bother . [just] execute [them] [because] _that's_ [that] _way_ _you're_ sure they'll never ever [going to] walk [the] streets again . 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [so] any any anybody [that] says life [in] prison [with] _no_ chance [of] parole i'd say [uh] give [them] [the death penalty] [so] 
A|42| A: [yeah] [you know] [it makes] sense [um] _you know _you_ have_ [the] occasional [person] _who_ [may have been] falsely accused [but] [i mean] [uh] [so] [few] [and] [far] [between] [uh you know] [makes] [good] t v movies [and] [that's] _about_ [it .] 
B|43| B: [yeah _and] and_ also [um] [the the] thing [i don't] [like] [about] [a lot _of] these_ court trials [and] [a lot _of] these_ [appeals] [is] [that] [it's] [not] based [on] [what] [is] true [and] [what] [is] false [but] rather [it's] _on the_ rules [of] evidence [what] can [i] hide [and] [what] [do] _i [have_ to] tell . 
A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: [and] [i think] our courts should _be_ geared _much_ [more] strongly towards finding [out] [the] truth _than_ [they] currently [are] . 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: _and and_ [that] _way_ [we] can _be_ sure [you [know] we] can find [out] [the] truth [we] can find [out] [what] really [happened] _and and_ base [the] sentence [on] [what] [the] [person] did [not] [on] [what] we're allowed [to] [let] _the jury_ hear 
A|48| A: [yeah] [i] _had_ [my] [uh] [my] father-in-law participated [in a] [uh] _a jury_ trial he [was] he [was] actually [on [the] jury] 
B|49| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|50| A: [and] [uh] _this man_ [was] accused [of] killing [uh [i think] it was] _two_ [people] [uh] [and] _shooting_ [a] [uh] policeman [um] point blank [in the] face . [of] course he didn't die . 
B|51| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|52| A: [and] [uh] [this] [was] [during a] holdup [of] [a] [uh] [uh] [a] restaurant [and] [it] came [out] [during the] trial [that] [um] [they] _had_ tried [to] rob another place [and] [uh] _when_ [the guy] came [out] [with] [the] bag [they] thought [was] money [it] turned [out to be] [a] couple cookies [and] [uh you know] jumbo cookies [and [and] so they] [were] [so] upset [from] robbing _this guy_ [you know] trying _to do_ [this] holdup [that] didn't work [that] [they] quite literally [were] mad [and] went into [a] restaurant [to] hold [the] place [up] [and] _just started_ [you know] _shooting people_ . 
B|53| B: [just started] [shooting people] [because] [they] botched [the] [first] job 
A|54| A: _you know it's_ 
B|55| B: [and so] [now] [they're going to _get] even_ . 
A|56| A: [yeah [.] [yeah] _and] [get_ even] [with] _who_ [i mean] 
B|57| B: [yeah .] 
A|58| A: [you know] stupid guys [and] [uh] [it] turned [out] [that] [the] [you know] policeman survived [to] [the] point [that] he [was] able [to] [you know] identify [the guy] . 
B|59| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|60| A: [and] [of] course [you know] [they] tried [to] [make] [the] cop _look_ [like] he [was uh] [a] [uh] [no] [good] rotten drunk . 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [i mean] [it was] amazing . 
B|63| B: [so] _what was_ [the] verdict _what was_ [the] results [there] . 
A|64| A: [oh] he [was] found _guilty_ [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [oh] . 
A|66| A: he [uh] [um] [last] [i] heard he [uh] he beat [a] push [for [the] death penalty] . [now] [whether] [they] finally [got] [it] [or not] [i don't] [know] . 
B|67| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|68| A: [i] [kind of] [uh] stopped listening after [a] while . 
B|69| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|70| A: [um] [you know] he _would_ come home [and _and] [you_ know] after [the] trial [was] over he came home [and] told us [what was] [going] [on] [and] [of] course [then] [they] _had_ [to] _go_ back [to] [you know] after he _had_ [to] _go_ 
B|71| B: [the the] [penalty] phase [yeah] [they've] decide [the] [penalty] separately [from] [the] verdict . 
A|72| A: [right] . [and] [uh] [yeah] everybody everybody [was] pretty [much] [you know] let's burn him . 
B|73| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|74| A: [and] [that's] [you know] [that's] _the way_ [they] wanted _to do_ [it .] [and] he [was] surprised [because] he thought [there] [was] [going to be] [a] problem [because] he [uh you know] some [people [on] the] [case] [were] [were] [a] little hesitant [on] [convicting] him [on] some [of the] charges [but] [i mean] _when_ [it] [all] came down [they] [just] within [an] hour decided [the] _man's_ fate . 
B|75| B: _yeah well_ [you know you] [just] [have to] decide [you know] [well] [there's] really [two] separate decisions _there i_ guess one [is] did [it] really happen [the way] [the the] prosecutor _said_ [it] [happened] [you know] [is] [this man] really [guilty] [and you have to] decide [that] [but] [then] [you have to] decide [you know] _as_ [a] member [of] society [what] [do] [i] want [to do] [with] [this guy] [who] did [this] thing . 
A|76| A: [yeah .] 
B|77| B: [and] [that _i] i've_ never [been [on] [a] jury] [i've] never [had] [that] experience i'm [not] sure i'd [look] forward [to] [making] _that kind of_ decision [about] [a] [man's] life . 
A|78| A: [yeah] [yeah well] [it] [it] [it] went pretty pretty quick [from what] he [said] . 
B|79| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|80| A: [but] [i mean] [there's] [there's] [there's] [a lot of] [other] [crimes] [out] [there [i] mean] besides murder [i think] [uh] [now] [if] [you're] dealing _drugs_ [now] [caught] [more] [than] twice [or] something [uh] [it] [there's] [uh] [a] [death penalty] associated [with] [it .] 
B|81| B: _uh-huh [._ [yeah] .] [well] [the] thing i'd [be] [most] likely [to] attach [the death penalty] [to] [is] [the] violence [. i mean] [i] can handle [people] [people] selling [drugs] [you know it's] [it's] wrong [but] [it] [it's] [not] worth somebody [getting] executed [for] . [but] [we] hear [so] [much] [about] [the] violence [and] how [it's] [not] safe [to] walk [the] streets [because] somebody [you know] _these_ random drive by shootings [and] [that] sort [of] thing . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [and] [the] [people] i'd [most] likely want [to] sentence [to death] [are] [the] [people] [that] [just] show [a] really _low_ regard [for] human life . [that] [you know you] never _know when_ [they're going to] turn [or] hurt [the] next [person] [because] [it] doesn't really matter [to] [them] [whether] [someone] else gets hurt [or not] . 
A|84| A: [yeah] [yeah] [i] agree . 
B|85| B: [and so] [i] [go] _these_ [are] [the] [kind [of] people] [i] [would] [like] [to get] [out of] [here] [and get] [out of] circulation [and] say [i don't] [we] [don't] accept [your] [kind] [in] our society . 
A|86| A: [yeah] [i] agree [i i've] [i have] [uh] [a] [low] tolerance [for] [that kind of] [uh [that] kind [of] person] . [and] [uh] [as] [far] [as] [uh you know] [there] [are] some some [other] [crimes] [that [i] think] [uh you know] [uh] kidnapping [um] [you [know] when] [they] [i mean] kidnapping per se has [a] certain [uh] [uh] fine [and] [penalty] associated [with] [it] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [but] [um] some [of these] [people] [are] [just] [out] [and] [out] brutal [. i] some [of the] cases [i've] heard [about] over [the] years
