A|0| A: okay , looks _like_ we're ready _to_ go . _capital punishment_ _, uh ,_ _the_ problem _i_ _have_ with _capital punishment_ _is_ _that _,_ uh _,_ uh ,_ _it's_ supposed _to_ _be_ _a deterrent_ _to_ crime , _but _i_ don't think that_ _it_ _really_ actually does _that_ . _i don't think_ _it_ deters anybody , _because_ most _of the_ time crimes _are_ _, uh ,_ _are_ committed with _a_ , without any thought _to_ _the_ consequences _and_ _they_ _don't think that _,_ uh ,_ stop _and_ _think_ _and_ say , _well ,_ maybe _i_ shouldn't _do_ this _, uh ,_ _because _,_ uh _,_ i_ might get _the_ gas chamber _or_ _something like that_ . _they_ worry _about_ _it_ afterwards _and_ _then_ _they_ try _and_ get out _of_ _it_ . _and _,_ uh ,_ how _about_ _you_ 
B|1| B: [well [,] i] [think that] _in_ some cases _, it_ [is] warranted . 
A|2| A: uh-huh [, i] _do_ , too , yep . 
B|3| B: _and _i_ don't , i_ [think] _in_ some cases [it] doesn't matter _if_ _it's [a_ deterrent] [or] _not_ . 
A|4| A: uh-huh , yeah _, you_ still _have_ _to_ _do it_ . [i] [, i] , 
B|5| B: [i] mean [i] mean _, i'm_ thinking [of] an extreme _case like_ [a] serial murderer 
A|6| A: uh-huh . 
B|7| B: _or ,_ 
A|8| A: so you're [in] , you're [in] favor [of] _capital punishment_ _, then_ . 
B|9| B: [well _,] for_ some things . 
A|10| A: right . 
B|11| B: [i] [think] _for_ serial murder [it] [is] warranted [because] _if_ [a] _person_ who _would_ [do] [something like that] [in] cold blood , 
A|12| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . needs _to_ _be_ punished [or _,] uh ,_ _eliminated from society ._ 
B|13| B: [i] mean [, you] can't guarantee [that] [they] wouldn't escape [from] _prison_ [and] [do it] _again ._ 
A|14| A: right . [and] _then_ [do it] all over [again .] uh-huh . 
B|15| B: _and [i_ [don't think that] _,] that_ rehabilitation [is] _effective_ . 
A|16| A: right . _have_ _to_ agree with [you] _, _and_ i'm_ _kind of_ [in] favor [of] _capital punishment_ also . [i] _just_ [don't think that] [it] acts much as [a deterrent] _to_ these _people_ _because _,_ uh , you_ still see _them_ committing _the_ same crimes , _but [,_ i] tend _to_ agree with [you] [that _,] uh _,_ we_ _should_ _have_ [it] [i] _just _,_ i don't know_ [that] [it's] always [effective] _but i_ guess _we_ _, uh ,_ we're _kind of_ stuck with [it] . [it's] , [it's a] difficult _, uh ,_ problem , isn't _it ,_ _to_ determine how you're _going to_ punish somebody [for] [a] particular crime _, uh ,_ 
B|17| B: [but [,] then] [, _you] know [,_ i] [think that _,] that_ some murderers [don't] [really] warrant [capital _punishment] _._ you know ,_ [just _,] like_ _, for example [,_ uh , _you] know [,_ you] hear [about] cases where women [have] _killed_ their husbands who abused [them] 
A|18| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . right , uh-huh . 
B|19| B: _and [i_ don't think] _, that_ _would_ [really] warrant [capital _punishment] ._ 
A|20| A: uh-huh , huh . [do] [you] _think they should be_ punished at all , [or [,] uh [,] like] go _to_ [prison] [, uh ,] [because] they're [not] [really] _a danger to _society_ ._ [it] _was_ almost [really] self defense , isn't _it ,_ [in] [a] [case [like] that] . 
B|21| B: [uh] [it] [is] [to] [a] certain extent 
A|22| A: uh-huh . 
B|23| B: [but i] [think] [, i don't know] [because ,] 
A|24| A: _i know_ [they] put [, uh ,] put [them] [in] jail sometimes [, i] guess . [uh ,] 
B|25| B: [i] [think] [in] [and] [it ,] [just] _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances [and [,] and] [the] extent [of the] abuse [and [,] and] _if_ another alternative [was] available . 
A|26| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . um . uh-huh [. you know ,] now [, i] wonder _what_ [you] [think] [about] this [and [,] uh ,] unfortunately _, we_ _, we_ [don't] get [to] [do [it] ,] [but [,] uh [,] it] used [to] _be_ [a] long time ago [, i] guess [in] biblical times when [they] had [punishment] [if] somebody did [something] [, for example ,] [to] your family [, then] [you] had [the] right [to] administer [the] [punishment .] so [if] somebody [killed] somebody [in] your family [then] [you] had [the] right [to] [, uh _,] if_ [that] [person] [was] caught [and] found guilty [, you] had [the] right [to] [, uh ,] execute [that] [person] . [and _i] know_ [that [,] uh _,] if_ somebody had done [something] [to] my family [, i] [would] feel [that] [i] had [the] right [to] , [to] get revenge on [them] [and [,] uh ,] [but [,] i] [, [i don't] think] that's done much anywhere that's _kind of drastic punishment ._ 
B|27| B: [well [,] i] [think that] [would] [be] [kind of drastic punishment .] 
A|28| A: right . 
B|29| B: [and ,] 
A|30| A: might make [you] feel better [but] 
B|31| B: [but ,] one thing [, i] [think that] [if] there [is] [a] chance [for] rehabilitation [then] [that] chance [should be] investigated . 
A|32| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|33| B: [but [,] like] [i] said [, if] [, if] someone [is] , [is] [just] pathologically [going to] murder [people] no matter [what] [then] [i] [think they should be] [eliminated from society .] 
A|34| A: uh-huh . right . uh-huh . right , [because] they're _a danger to_ everybody else . huh , that's interesting . [i] [have] [to] [, uh] agree with [that] . 
B|35| B: [but ,] 
A|36| A: there's _a lot of_ folks , probably [, _that] are_ _in prison_ [that [,] uh [,] _that] aren't_ [really] _a danger to society_ , huh [, [and] [,] uh ,] 
B|37| B: [and] [a lot of] [people] [that are] [a danger to society] [that aren't] [in prison] . 
A|38| A: right . right , probably more [of] [them] [then] [the] other way around interesting . [i don't [, [i] don't] ,] [not] sure [i] [, i'm] [in] washington , d c [or] at least very close [to] [it] . [i'm] [not] sure [what] [kind of] [, uh ,] [capital punishment] _we_ [have] here . 
B|39| B: [well [,] [i] know] [in] north carolina [, we] [do] [have] [capital [punishment] .] 
A|40| A: uh-huh .
