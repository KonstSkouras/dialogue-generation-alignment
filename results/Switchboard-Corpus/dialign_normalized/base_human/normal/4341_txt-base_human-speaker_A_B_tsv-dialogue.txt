B|1| B: [well] [i] [think that] _in_ some cases [it] [is] warranted . 
A|2| A: uh-huh [i] _do_ too yep . 
B|3| B: _and _i_ don't i_ [think] _in_ some cases [it] doesn't matter _if_ _it's [a_ deterrent] [or] _not_ . 
A|4| A: uh-huh yeah _you_ still _have_ _to_ _do it_ . [i] [i] 
B|5| B: [i] mean [i] mean _i'm_ thinking [of] an extreme _case like_ [a] serial murderer 
A|6| A: uh-huh . 
B|7| B: [or] 
A|8| A: so you're [in] you're [in] favor [of] _capital punishment_ _then_ . 
B|9| B: [well] _for_ some things . 
A|10| A: right . 
B|11| B: [i] [think] _for_ serial murder [it] [is] warranted [because] _if_ [a] _person_ who _would_ [do] [something like that] [in] cold blood 
A|12| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . needs _to_ _be_ punished [or] _uh_ _eliminated from society ._ 
B|13| B: [i] mean [you] can't guarantee [that] [they] wouldn't escape [from] _prison_ [and] [do it] _again ._ 
A|14| A: right . [and] _then_ [do it] all over [again .] uh-huh . 
B|15| B: _and [i_ don't think that] [that] rehabilitation [is] _effective_ . 
A|16| A: right . _have_ _to_ agree with [you] _and i'm_ _kind of_ [in] favor [of] _capital punishment_ also . [i] _just_ [don't think that] [it] acts much as [a deterrent] _to_ these _people_ [because] _uh you_ still see _them_ committing _the_ same crimes _but i_ tend _to_ agree with [you] [that] _uh_ _we_ _should_ _have_ [it] [i] _just_ _i don't know_ [that] [it's] always [effective] _but i_ guess _we_ _uh_ we're _kind of_ stuck with [it] . [it's] [it's a] difficult _uh_ problem isn't [it] _to_ determine how you're _going to_ punish somebody [for] [a] particular crime _uh_ 
B|17| B: [but] _then _you_ know_ [i] [think that] [that] some murderers [don't] [really] warrant [capital _punishment] _._ you know_ [just] [like] _for example_ [uh _you] know_ [you] hear [about] cases where women [have] _killed_ their husbands who abused [them] 
A|18| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . right uh-huh . 
B|19| B: _and [i_ don't think that] _would_ [really] warrant [capital _punishment] ._ 
A|20| A: uh-huh huh . [do] [you] _think they should be_ punished at all [or] [uh] [like] go _to_ [prison] [uh] [because] they're [not] [really] _a danger to _society_ ._ [it] _was_ almost [really] self defense isn't [it] [in] [a] [case [like] that] . 
B|21| B: _uh it_ [is] [to] [a] certain extent 
A|22| A: uh-huh . 
B|23| B: [but i] [think] [i don't know] [because] 
A|24| A: _i know_ [they] put [uh] put [them] [in] jail sometimes [i] guess . [uh] 
B|25| B: [i] [think] [in] [and] [it] [just] _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances [and] [and] [the] extent [of the] abuse [and] [and] _if_ another alternative [was] available . 
A|26| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . um . uh-huh [. you know] now [i] wonder _what_ [you] [think] [about] this [and] [uh] unfortunately _we_ _we_ [don't] get [to] [do it] [but] [uh it] used [to] _be_ [a] long time ago [i] guess [in] biblical times when [they] had [punishment] [if] somebody did [something] [for example] [to] your family [then you] had [the] right [to] administer [the] [punishment .] so [if] somebody [killed] somebody [in] your family [then you] had [the] right [to] [uh] [if] [that] [person] [was] caught [and] found guilty [you] had [the] right [to] [uh] execute [that] [person] . [and _i] know_ [that] [uh] [if] somebody had done [something] [to] my family [i] [would] feel [that] [i] had [the] right [to] [to] get revenge on [them] [and] [uh] [but i] [i don't think] that's done much anywhere that's _kind of drastic punishment ._ 
B|27| B: [well] [i] [think that] [would] [be] [kind of drastic punishment .] 
A|28| A: right . 
B|29| B: [and] 
A|30| A: might make [you] feel better [but] 
B|31| B: [but] one thing [i] [think that] [if] there [is] [a] chance [for] rehabilitation [then] [that] chance [should be] investigated . 
A|32| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|33| B: [but] [like] [i] said [if] [if] someone [is] [is] [just] pathologically [going to] murder [people] no matter [what] [then] [i] [think they should be] [eliminated from society .] 
A|34| A: uh-huh . right . uh-huh . right [because] they're _a danger to_ everybody else . huh that's interesting . [i] [have] [to] [uh] agree with [that] . 
B|35| B: [but] 
A|36| A: there's _a lot of_ folks probably _that are_ _in prison_ [that] [uh] _that aren't_ [really] _a danger to society_ huh [and] [uh] 
B|37| B: [and] [a lot of] [people] [that are] [a danger to society] [that aren't] [in prison] . 
A|38| A: right . right probably more [of] [them] [then] [the] other way around interesting . [i don't [i] don't] [not] sure [i] [i'm] [in] washington d c [or] at least very close [to] [it] . [i'm] [not] sure [what] [kind of] [uh] [capital punishment] _we_ [have] here . 
B|39| B: [well] [i know] [in] north carolina [we] [do] [have] [capital [punishment] .] 
A|40| A: uh-huh . 
B|41| B: [and i'm] [i'm] [from] south carolina .
