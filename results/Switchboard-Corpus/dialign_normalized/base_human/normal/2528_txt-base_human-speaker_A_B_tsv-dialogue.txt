B|45| B: [oh really ?] 
A|46| A: _i think it's_ been [on] _i think_ _i've_ seen [it] during [the] day . 
B|47| B: [oh] . 
A|48| A: definitely seen [it on] [on] during [the] day down _there_ _and i don't_ _think _it's_ a_ very [violent] show _i think it's_ funny [. _i] think _it's_ a_ real good concept _i think it's_ [something] completely [new] . 
B|49| B: [i think it's] _great [._ i] love [watching] [a] microbiologist fighting [off] [with] [a] policemen [or _something] else_ [and] competition [. i'm] going [oh] _great_ [you know] [it's a] [it's a] _great_ role model [for] [everybody] . 
A|50| A: [i think] [so] [i think] [because] people sort _of_ get through [you know] [um] [i think] [that] people sort _of_ learn [the] importance _of_ sort _of_ _physical_ fitness as _well_ as [the] as _well_ as [you know] some mental fitness _and [i_ think] [that] people sort _of_ learn good sportsmanship [and] [so] forth . 
B|51| B: [oh] [yes] [i mean] _when i_ _had_ [uh] _i was_ [watching] _it the first_ [time i] [ever] _saw_ [a] microbiologist _on there_ _i thought_ [well] [it] [just] goes [to] prove [it] [has] _nothing_ [to] [do] [with] [your] [physical] capabilities [. [and] uh] [there] _she was_ terrific _she was_ [really] terrific . 
A|52| A: [well] [don't] [they] take people who [have] some sort _of_ [um] big abilities [like] [and] [and] [at] least [they] used [to] [when] [it] [when] [it the first] ones [i] [saw] [they] [had] [um] [a] _man_ [on] who [was] [uh] [he] played college football [and] almost went pro _and they_ _had a_ _a woman_ who [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] [she was] [the] _uh [she_ was] _in the_ junior olympics [or something] [or] [they] seem [to] [have] people who [have] very very big sports backgrounds . [to] [have] [they] leaned away [from] [that] sort _of_ 
B|53| B: [they] hold competitions [in] los angeles [in] [um] florida [and] minneapolis [um] trying [to] [think] _of [i_ think it's] [in] four places [around] [the] united states . [they] hold competition [and the] only requirement [is] [of] course [your] skill [of] passing [these] tests 
A|54| A: _oh that's_ how [they] [do] [it .] 
B|55| B: [and that's] [it [.] and] [we] [had a] bar [man] [from] _here in_ dallas area [that] made [it .] 
A|56| A: [really ?] 
B|57| B: [there] [is] [a woman] [that] [uh] made [well] [she] called herself [a] craft person [so] [i'm not] quite [sure] [what] [she] made [. [and] [uh] she] made [it [.] [i] mean] [there] [is] [no] [your] occupation [has] _nothing_ [to] [do] [with] [it .] 
A|58| A: [yeah] _okay_ [i] [just] [thought] [they] [had] some 
B|59| B: strictly [your] skill . 
A|60| A: [yeah [i] thought] [they] [had] some sort [of [i] mean] [i thought] [they] were [just] poor people [like] us [i] guess [not] [that's] [great .] 
B|61| B: huh-uh . 
A|62| A: [but] maybe [i'll] try [it] [one] day . [i'll] get [on there] [one] day [and] _see_ if [i can] [uh] _um what_ [what] [do] [they] win _they they_ win money [i think] [don't] [they] ? 
B|63| B: [i think the] last [i] heard [was] [it's] _up_ [to] [about _a] hundred_ fifty thousand dollars . 
A|64| A: [really ?] 
B|65| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|66| A: wow . all [that] [for] getting tennis balls shot [at] [you] [at] [a hundred] miles an hour .

A|68| A: [one] [little ball here] [and] [there] [yeah] [and] [this] guy's beating [you] [up] [so] [i don't know] [the] beating [up] part [. i] [i] actually feel [the] tennis balls would hurt . 
B|69| B: [oh] _well [they_ they] come out [with] [a lot of] bruises too . 
A|70| A: [they] look [like] [yeah] [they] seem [like] [a] tennis [ball] _but it_ almost doesn't look [like] [it's] almost livable [yeah] [the] best [i] [i don't] [think] [i] _could_ [i] [i] _could_ handle those tennis balls . [so] [what] [else] [to] [you] [tape] besides [american] [at] [there] anything [else] ?

A|78| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [and i don't] [have] [to] concentrate too [hard] [on] _them ._ 
A|80| A: [but] [i'm] [sure] [that's] fun . 
B|81| B: [um] most [of] [the] [lawyer] programs [like] [uh] [law and order] they're [not] _on the_ times [that] [i've] got [that] [i've] [watched] [because] [i haven't] [had] [t] got [t v] guide [around _here] in_ ages . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] [oh] _okay_ [well they] seem [to] _be_ [on] later 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: all always right right before [the] _news is_ [when i] catch [them [.] i] [i] tend [to] if [nothing] [else] [is] _in the_ town television _at eleven_ o'clock [just] [to watch] [the] _news_ [and] [or] [or] nightline [or something] [just] sort [of] get [a] good [you know] [a] good [a] good [think] [for] [the] day . 
B|85| B: [your] [news _is] on at eleven_ ? 
A|86| A: [yes .] [when] [is] yours [on] ? 
B|87| B: _ten_ _i was_ [just] _in the middle_ [of] [watching] [it .] 
A|88| A: [oh] gosh [well] [i'm] sorry [i] interrupted [um] 
B|89| B: [oh that's] [okay .] 
A|90| A: [yeah] ours [is on] 
B|91| B: [no] problem . 
A|92| A: actually [it] ours [is on at eleven] [it] [it's] [um] [eleven] o'clock now [here or] [eleven] twenty-five now [here [in] new york] . [um] [i think] [they they] [do] [that [i] think] [they] put things [on at] [um] [eleven] o'clock [here] [and [i] think] [they] put [it] [like] [eleven] o'clock [um] california [time] [like] [in] california [but] [in the middle] [they] sort [of] [um] [like] central [time] [or] mountain [time] [they they] push things back . [so] [i was] actually actually [i'm not] [sure] [i was] [in] [i was] [in] iowa awhile ago [and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier [so] does [your] prime [time] _start_ _at seven_ o'clock ? 
B|93| B: [no] [well _they] have_ [it] [at] six [and _they] have_ [it] [at] nine 
A|94| A: wait [no] [no] 
B|95| B: [and _they] have_ [one] _at ten ._ 
A|96| A: [not] [not] even [the] [news] [but] [do] [they have] [like] [um] [do] [like] sort [of] all [the] regular sitcoms [and] [so] forth _start_ _at seven_ o'clock ? [you] [so] [like] [you know] [the] regular television shows [that] are [that] are very popular [do] _they start_ _at seven_ [or] [or] _at eight_ ? 
B|97| B: [i'm] trying [to] [think] . both [um] let's [see] [they start] [um] evening shade _at seven [and_ then] [it] goes [to] [um what] [is] [it] after evening [um] 
A|98| A: right [because] [that] would [the] _eight_ o'clock [here] . 
B|99| B: [that's] [major] dad [at eight] [i think] [it] [is] . 
A|100| A: [yeah] [that] [that] would all [start] [at] [at] [um] [that] would all [start] [at] [at eight] o'clock [here] [that] wouldn't [start] [at seven] . [we] [have] [um] [at seven] o'clock [we] [just] [have] [um] [the] they'll [play] [you know] [they have] old reruns [of] _cheers_ [or something] [from] [seven] [to] [seven] thirty [and then] [something else] [from] [seven] thirty [to] [eight] 
B|101| B: [huh] . 
A|102| A: [and] ours [start] [at] [at] [at] [at eight] [and] end [at eleven] [that's] why [we] [. i] [i] would actually [like] [it] better if everything started [at seven and] ended [at ten .] 
B|103| B: [yeah] [it's] [it's] stopped [around here] [at ten] [and it] goes into [night] programs _at that_ point which [could] [be] [one of] [you know] many different [night] programs [but it] goes into [night] programs . 
A|104| A: [oh that's] [great .] 
B|105| B: [but] [uh] [do you] [ever] _watch cheers_ ? 
A|106| A: [oh] all [the] [time] [. do you] [watch cheers] 
B|107| B: [oh yeah] [oh [yeah] .] 
A|108| A: [it's] [at that] [was] actually [a] big dilemma [for] me now [because] [um] [cheers] [cheers] [and] twin peaks are now [on the] [same time]
