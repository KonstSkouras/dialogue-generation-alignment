A|0| A: _so where_ _was_ your _last vacation_ ? 
B|1| B: _uh_ _actually_ _my last vacation _was_ in_ connecticut _. uh_ _we_ _went_ home _to_ _visit_ family . before _that_ _we were_ _in_ _hawaii_ . 
A|2| A: _oh_ _i_ i'd _well_ [actually] _i_ _did_ [visit] [hawaii] once _but i_ never made _it_ _off_ _of_ _oahu_ which _i've_ heard _is_ not _the_ nicest _of the_ _islands_ . 
B|3| B: [oh] _. _it_ wasn't_ [actually] _. it_ when _we were_ _in_ [oahu] _uh_ [i] couldn't wait _to get_ [off] _we we_ _took a_ cruise _and we_ _went to_ four different [islands] _and _it_ was a_ _really_ nice kauai [was] nice _and_ maui [was] nice _. _we_ had_ _we had_ _a_ _great_ _time ._ 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _we were there_ _for ten days_ . 
A|6| A: [oh] _that's_ _wow _._ yeah ._ 
B|7| B: [yeah] _yes ._ [so where] _have_ _you_ _been_ ? 
A|8| A: [oh] _i've_ _i've_ [been] _lots of_ _places_ . [my last vacation was] [actually] [in] _morocco _i_ guess_ [we] [that] one _would_ count 
B|9| B: [morocco] . _really_ . 
A|10| A: [uh] [that] [was] about [a] year [and] [a] half ago [and] 
B|11| B: _no_ kidding . _what_ _what_ _did you_ _just_ decide _to go there_ _or_ 
A|12| A: [uh] _well_ [my] husband _is_ french [and [we] were] living _in france_ at _the_ [time] 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [and we] decided _that i_ _i've_ never [been] [to] africa _and i_ needed [to get] [that] continent since [i] hadn't [been] [there] yet . [and _it] it's_ [actually] _it's a_ fairly common [vacation] place [for] french _people_ [to go] _and they_ speak french [and] [so] [uh] _you know in_ [that] sense _is_ [just] _a little_ _bit_ easier 
B|15| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: [and it] [just] seemed _like_ [it] _would be_ [a] fun place [to go] . [and] [so] [we we] _didn't_ [really] [have] enough [time .] 
B|17| B: [yeah .] [oh] _i'm_ sure _it was_ _wonderful_ . 
A|18| A: [we had] about _a little_ _bit_ less than two weeks . 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [and] as always [it] [it] seems _a bit_ [uh] rushed [. we] do [a] lot _of_ traveling _around_ [. we] rented [a] car [and] drove pretty much everywhere . 
B|21| B: [was] [it] hot ? 
A|22| A: [no] [in] fact some _of the_ [days] [we] froze _. it was_ 
B|23| B: [really] ? 
A|24| A: _well_ [we were there] _in the_ winter . [in] [uh] january [or] february _i don't remember_ which 
B|25| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh _._ _i_ was_ born [in] saudi arabia [and] [uh] when [my] father worked [there] [we] [they] used _to travel_ quite [a bit] _all_ [around] [you know in] [in] _europe_ [and] whatnot 
A|26| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: [but _i] was_ _very_ young _so [i_ don't remember] [that] _and i was_ three when [we] moved back here . 
A|28| A: at at excuse _me_ at [what] age [did you] [oh] _that's_ _too_ bad _because_ 
B|29| B: _so [i_ don't remember] _but we_ [have] _all_ these _wonderful_ pictures [of] _all_ these _great_ [places] [that] [they] _have been_ 
A|30| A: [uh-huh] 
B|31| B: _and that _i_ was_ when _i _was_ a_ baby [but] [so] [morocco _i] think_ [would be] _wonderful_ [because] [that's] [you know] [that's] [that] area [of the] world _i think_ [would be] _great_ . 
A|32| A: [yeah _.] [it was_ a] [very] interesting [vacation] . [the] only thing [i] _didn't_ _like_ [was in] some [of the] more touristy areas [uh] um [the] [it] [would] [just] [be] besieged _by_ _people_ wanting [to] [be] your guide 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _and _you_ there_ [were] some [places] [where] _people_ 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: [there] [would be] kids [there] [that] [were] excellent at ripping [you] [off] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [and [we] had] nothing taken [because] [we] knew [and [we] had] _things_ [in] inside pockets [and] _in [you know_ in] jacket underneath [a] coat type [of] thing . 
B|39| B: [really] . 
A|40| A: [but] 
B|41| B: [we we] found [that] [in] jamaica [. it was] [the] same _way_ [that] [people] [would] come _up_ [and] try [and] sell [you] [well] try [and] sell drugs [and] [things] _like that_ 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [but] [they] _they were_ [so] destitute [and [i] guess] [they] [they] make _all_ their money on tourism [and] [and they] [would] come _up_ [and] ask [you] [you know] _if_ _if you_ want [to] buy different [things] [and] [really] _after_ awhile [it] [really] gets annoying 
A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: [you know] [it _it's] a little_ scary [too] when they're coming _up_ [and] they're _all_ _over_ _you ._ 
A|46| A: [the] [the] worst place [was in] marrakech 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [and] [the] other cities [it wasn't] nearly as bad [and] [a] couple [of] them [it was] [what] [we] [did] [in] some [of the] other cities [and they] tell [you] [to] do [that] _is_ [to] hire [a] local guide 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [it] doesn't matter who [it] _is_ [and they] keep everyone _else_ away from [you .] 
B|51| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|52| A: [and] [it's] worth [it] [and] [it's] [like] [ten] _dollars_ [a] day [or] something [and] its worth [it] [just] [to] keep everyone _else_ away from badgering [you] 
B|53| B: [really] . 
A|54| A: _and you_ feel stupid doing [that] [but we] [did] [it] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and [we] were] much happier 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: _and you_ also [get] [in] [to] _see_ [things] [that] [you] might not [get] into [if you] [were] alone [uh] 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] [well] [that's] _great_ . [where] [else] [have] [you] [been] ? 
A|60| A: [uh] 
B|61| B: [well] [you] lived [in france] 
A|62| A: [yes .] 
B|63| B: [so] you've _been all through europe_ . 
A|64| A: [no] [actually] [i] haven't [been all through europe] [like] [i] haven't [been] [to] italy yet . 
B|65| B: [no] . [really] . 
A|66| A: [uh] we're going [to go] _for a_ conference [in] september [and] [so] hopefully we'll [get] [to travel] [a little] [bit] [too] . 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [uh] [my] more exciting spots [have been] _i've_ [been] [to] [the] galapagos [islands] . 
B|69| B: [really] ? 
A|70| A: [uh-huh] [that] [was] one [of the] most [wonderful] vacations _i've_ ever [had] . 
B|71| B: [lots of] _wildlife_ huh ? [yeah .] 
A|72| A: [yes .] [if you] [like] [wildlife] [it's a] fabulous [vacation] . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [if _you] don't_ [like] [wildlife] [it's] probably not [of] interest [but] [it] [that] [was] [really] [really] fabulous [and] [just] [the] photos [i] [have] [of] [it] [and] gosh incredible [and] [be] [so] close 
B|75| B: now when [was] [that] when [were] [you there] ? 
A|76| A: um august eighty-eight . 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [and] then [actually] [after] [there] [i] [went to] um [hawaii] [a] lot [of] [my] [travel] has [been] sort [of] based [around] conferences [or] business meetings 
B|79| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [and] [so i] [went to] [hawaii] [and] then [to] australia [and] _japan_ [and] china 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] [did you] [go] on [the] _barrier_ [did you] [see] _the great barrier reef_ [and] [and] [go] snorkeling ? 
A|82| A: [i] [i] [actually] [i] _didn't_ [go] _diving ._ 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [i] [i'm] [a] diver [and] [so] [that's] [that's] [actually] [been] another [of] [my] favorite vacations has [been] taking [little] _diving_ trips 
B|85| B: [oh] [diving [.] uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [but] [uh] [no] [i] _didn't_ [get] [to] [the great barrier reef] [. i] drove from sidney down [to] melbourne [and] [over] [to] adelaide . 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [it's] gorgeous absolutely gorgeous . [the] coastline [was] [just] incredible . [it's] huge . 
B|89| B: [is] [it] [really] ? 
A|90| A: australia _. yeah ._ 
B|91| B: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|92| A: [uh] [but]

A|96| A: [i don't] [think] [so] . 
B|97| B: [i] [remember] food 
A|98| A: [oh] [i] [like that] [too] . [but] [uh] [in] fact [i] [didn't] eat out [that] much [there] [because] [i was] traveling _by_ myself [in] [a] car [it] [would] [have been] [i think] much more fun [to] do [it] [like] _in the_ van with [a] bunch [of] [people] . 
B|99| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: [but] [uh] 
B|101| B: [oh] _you're_ adventurous . [you] [went] [by] yourself . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [really] . 
A|104| A: [and i was] [by] myself [in] china [too] . 
B|105| B: [really] ? 
A|106| A: [yeah .] 
B|107| B: [oh] [wow .] 
A|108| A: china [was [a] little] [bit] more [uh] [of] [a] challenge . [but] [it] [it wasn't] more [of] [a] challenge [in] [a] sense [because] [i] hired [a] guide [all] [the] [time] 
B|109| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [and] [so i] never [you know] got out [by] myself [or] not much 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] [was] [it] [very] expensive ? 
A|112| A: [no] [actually] [i] paid about either _a thousand dollars_ [or] [a little] [bit] [no] maybe [it was] about _a thousand dollars_ maybe [a little] [bit] less [i _don't] really_ [remember] [for ten days] including [all] [my] meals [a] guide [a] car [the] airfare [and] [but] [this] [is] from hong kong 
B|113| B: _you're_ kidding ! [no] kidding ! [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [because] [i was] already [in] hong kong [and] um [but] [it] only cost [you] about _a thousand dollars_ [to go there] [and i] [went to] beijing shanghai chengdu [and] [actually] then [i] [took a] train [up] from shanghai [to] [a little] quingdao [i think] [is] [the] name [of] [it] . [it's a little] [uh] sort [of] getaway retreat village not far from shanghai . [it's] [just] [a] train ride . 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [and that i] [had] two internal one [yeah] two internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other [things] [. it was] [really] 
B|117| B: [all] [for [a] thousand dollars] ? 
A|118| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [wow] ! [that] [really] surprises [me] . 
A|120| A: [around] [a thousand] . 
B|121| B: [i guess] [i] relate [it] [to] [to] [japan] [where] [things] are [very] expensive aren't [they] ? 
A|122| A: [oh] japan's ridiculous . 
B|123| B: [yeah [.] yeah .] 
A|124| A: [and i] stayed [i] [didn't] _stay in the_ top [of the] line hotels [but i] stayed [in] [they were] [all] completely clean 
B|125| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|126| A: _and [you_ know [they] were] newly built [and [they] were] sort [of the] lower end [of the] top [of the] line hotels [because] [they] said [you] can't _stay in the_ cheap stuff . 
B|127| B: [uh-huh [.] yeah] [yeah] [and [you] don't] want [to] [stay in the] [very] [very] [very] exclusive _because [you_ [don't] really] even [get] [a] flavor [of the] country _if you're_ 
A|128| A: right . right . 
B|129| B: [yeah] [yeah .] [wow .] 
A|130| A: [uh] [but] [yeah] [that] [was] [i] highly recommend [that] [way] [to go] . [if you're] ever interested [in] going [the] route [i] dealt with [this] woman her name [was] rita at china tours [in] boston 
B|131| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|132| A: [yeah [.] uh] [and] [a] friend [of] mine who [had] gone [for a] business trip [to] china [and] she [just] gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and it] [would] [really] [be] fun [i think] ideally with [like] two couples [because [you] have] [a] car [and] [a] driver [and] [a] guide 
B|133| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|134| A: [and] then
