B|0| B: _okay_ . 
A|1| A: _all_ _right ._ 
B|2| B: um _i_ _i_ understand _that_ _it's_ being proposed _as a_ requirement _for_ _uh_ _young_ people _to be_ _to_ _go_ into _public service ._ 
A|3| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|4| B: _i think_ 
A|5| A: yes _all_ _all_ [young] americans _they_ did _not_ specify _you know_ _exactly_ what [young] means . 
B|6| B: _yeah _yeah ._ _i_ think_ _that_ _it_ _probably_ _would be a_ _a_ _good_ program _. _i_ think_ _probably_ _two years_ _is_ _too long ._ 
A|7| A: [yeah .] 
B|8| B: _i think_ _maybe_ _a_ _year_ _would be the_ longest . 
A|9| A: _yeah . yeah_ you're [probably] _right_ [two years] _might_ [be _a] little_ [too long .] 
B|10| B: _yeah and_ _there_ will _be a lot of_ rebellion _in_ _that_ _and_ when [you] get people who _have_ no desire _to be_ _there_ _in the_ first place _i don't_ _think_ _that_ they're going _to be_ serving anybody . 
A|11| A: _that's right ._ _that _that_ [would_ be the] problem . _sure_ [would] . 
B|12| B: [yeah .] so _i think_ _it _would_ be a_ _good_ _thing_ though _to_ encourage other people who aren't _even_ aware [that] [they] can _do_ such [a] _thing_ . _to_ get _out there_ _and_ _do_ so . 
A|13| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh _._ yeah_ _or_ [maybe] offer _them_ _you know_ _some_ sort [of] an incentive _to _do_ _it_ ._ _uh you know_ _college credit_ _you know_ _something_ _you know_ 
B|14| B: [yeah .] [right .] 
A|15| A: _i'm not sure_ what _but_ 
B|16| B: [right .] [college credit] _is_ [a] _good idea_ because 
A|17| A: _i'm not sure_ [they] _need [to_ be] _you know_ paid _you know_ [a] super [do] salary [of] any _kind_ . 
B|18| B: [right .] 
A|19| A: _but_ _that _that_ kind of_ takes _away from_ [public service .] 
B|20| B: [that's right] [yeah] [they] [probably] _couldn't_ [do] anything monetary _but i think_ giving giving _some [kind_ of] [college credit] 
A|21| A: [but] _just_ _you know_ [to] receive [a] letter [in the] mail [that] says _you know_ [you] _need to_ report somewhere by next monday _you know_ [you] _need to_ report somewhere by next monday _you know_ . _i'm not sure _that_ [would_ be a] terrifically [good idea] . 
B|22| B: no _i don't_ _think_ so _either_ because _a lot of_ people um depending _on_ how [the] [public service] _programs are_ set _up_ _and_ [i'm not] [that] familiar _with_ [them] [to] [know] 
A|23| A: [i'm not] [either] _really_ . 
B|24| B: [but] [you know] _if_ [a] _a lot of_ people flat can't afford [to] . 
A|25| A: _that's right ._ 
B|26| B: [you know] 
A|27| A: _that's right ._ 
B|28| B: _and_ most kids these days _have_ gotten themselves into [uh] financial situations where [they] _have to be_ working [all] [the] _time ._ 
A|29| A: _uh-huh _._ that's right ._ absolutely _. they_ _need_ [young] families whatever 
B|30| B: so _it's_ _it's a_ [really] _tough question [._ that's right .] 
A|31| A: _they just_ [couldn't] [you know] _take_ off _to do that ._ 
B|32| B: [yeah] 
A|33| A: oh 
B|34| B: _and_ _if_ [you] put [them] [in] [public service] [right] _out_ [of] high school then [that that] postpones _their_ [college] _for_ [a] _year_ 
A|35| A: [that's right] _uh-huh ._ 
B|36| B: _and_ [that would] upset _a lot of_ people [too] because [they just] want [to] get _on_ 
A|37| A: _uh-huh_ [it] _sure_ [would] _. [it_ _would] have to [be_ a lot of] [you know] thought given [to] _something like that_ [i] [would] [think] . 
B|38| B: _yeah . i_ [you know] _i think_ [it [would] be] [good] _for_ [a lot of] people [to] get involved [in] [that kind of] program 
A|39| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|40| B: _but i_ _i think_ [it] can't [be] [something] [that's] mandatory . 
A|41| A: _yeah . yeah ._ 
B|42| B: [it] has [to be] [something] [that's] voluntary . [you know] which _is_ pretty _much_ [the] _way_ [it] _is_ _now_ [. they] [might] 
A|43| A: [that's right .] [i'm not] [even] [really] _sure_ at this point [in] [time] [you know] what what [programs are] [out there] . 
B|44| B: _yeah and_ [that's] [the] other _thing_ _is_ [that] [you know] instead [of] making [it] mandatory [they] [maybe] [need to] publicize [it] [a little] bit better _. and_ [uh _you know] go_ [to] [the] schools _and_ [do] [programs] _and_ tell [them] [that] _we_ [need] _your_ help _and you know_ [uh] volunteer _for_ such _and_ such [a] [time] 
A|45| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|46| B: _and_ you've [a] choice [of] where [you] want [to] _go_ . 
A|47| A: [yeah .] 
B|48| B: _and_ _and_ [that] _way_ handling [it] [that] _way_ _they could_ [probably] get [some] results [out] [of] [it .] 
A|49| A: [yeah] _like_ [maybe] [if] [if] [there] was [something] [they could] [do] _in their own_ _own_ _in their own_ town _or_ city [yeah and] [not] [have to] pull [up] roots [and [you know] go] somewhere half [way] around [the] world _or something_ . 
B|50| B: [yeah] [in their own] community _right . yeah _that's_ true_ most [of] [them] [probably] wouldn't [do] [something _like that] ._ although [there] [are] [a lot of] kids who [would] [do it] [just] [to] get [away from] [their] parents 
A|51| A: [that's [right .] yeah that's] [that's true] _too [._ [that's] true] _too ._ 
B|52| B: [but] [they] [would have to be] supported [in] [some] [way] [and] [i'm not sure that] those [programs are] available [to do that .] 
A|53| A: [yeah yeah .] me neither [. [and] you] wonder [you know] what [kind of] quality job [would] _they do_ [you know] [just] sit around [for] [their] [year] 
B|54| B: [right .] 
A|55| A: _or_ [would] [they] [really] [you know] make [a] contribution [of] [some kind] . 
B|56| B: [right] [exactly] . 
A|57| A: [yeah] [it's] _tough . it's_ _tough ._ 
B|58| B: [yeah] [it] _is_ [tough . it's] _and _i_ don't_ [know] who's [even] proposing [it] [or] [or] how [they] plan _on_ implementing [it] [if] [they do] . 
A|59| A: _yeah . yeah . i_ [i'm not sure] [either] . [but i think] [there] [would have to [be] a lot] _more_ [you know] information [you know] disseminated before [you] say let's [do] this [you know] . 
B|60| B: [yeah . yeah . [i] think] going [to] [the] schools [would be the] easiest [for] [them] . 
A|61| A: [yeah .] 
B|62| B: [you know] [it] [be] [it] wouldn't [take] [up] _much_ _much_ [it would] [take] [up] [more] [time] than anything [but] [it] wouldn't [take] [up] [a lot of] money . 
A|63| A: [yeah .] 
B|64| B: [they] wouldn't [have to] spend money advertising [and] _things like that ._ 
A|65| A: [yeah [.] that's right .] 
B|66| B: [you] [go] [to] school [and you] [have] [a] [kind of] [a] captive audience get [them] [all] [in the] auditorium 
A|67| A: [yeah .] 
B|68| B: [and you] [you] give [them] _your_ speech [and] [maybe] [a little] slide show [or something] 
A|69| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|70| B: _and [i_ think] [that] [they could] get [some] results [from] [that] because [there] [are] [a lot of] people who [are] volunteer [and] community minded 
A|71| A: [right .] 
B|72| B: [but] [they] _don't_ [know] where [to] [go] [to] [to] [to do] anything . 
A|73| A: [that's [right [.] yeah] [.] that's] [a] real waste _too _._ it really is ._ 
B|74| B: [yeah] [it] [is [.] it really is .] 
A|75| A: [i don't] [really] see [the] emphasis [on] [things like] peace corps [like] [we] [you know] [we] saw back [i] guess [in the] carter administration 
B|76| B: [right .] 
A|77| A: [that] was [that] was [a] big [thing] [with] him . 
B|78| B: [yeah yeah .] 
A|79| A: [and i] guess [even] back [to] kennedy [as a] matter [of] fact [i] guess kennedy may [be the] _one_ [that] actually started [the] [thing] [or] was [you know] [really] interested [in] [things like that .] 
B|80| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [i] [just] [don't] hear [much] about [it] anymore . [like] [i] say [i don't] [even] [know] what [programs are] [are] [even] ongoing [now] [you know] . 
B|82| B: [i don't] [either] [that's] [one] 
A|83| A: anyway [it's _a] tough question ._ 
B|84| B: [yeah] [it] [is] [a tough question .] 
A|85| A: [okay] well thanks [for] [your] [time [.] i] enjoyed talking [to] [you] .
