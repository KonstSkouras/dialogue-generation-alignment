B|1| B: [i guess] _so ._ 
A|2| A: i've _been_ called several times _and_ [i] push _in_ pushed _in_ my number _they_ kept _saying you_ have _the_ invalid code 
B|3| B: _oh_ _really_ . 
A|4| A: _and then_ [i] found _out_ _that_ my new phone _wasn't_ _working_ _right ._

A|8| A: [i] wonder how long _it's_ _going_ _to_ be _on_ _for_ . 
B|9| B: _i think_ five minutes [is the] max . 
A|10| A: [oh] _no i_ mean _this_ whole thing like _for_ two months _or something_ do _you know_ ? 
B|11| B: [oh] [i] _don't_ _know ._ 
A|12| A: [yeah] okay _well_ back _to_ crime [i guess] we're supposed _to_ talk _about_ _that ._ _they_ say _what_ aspect _are_ _you_ worried _about_ _well_ [i think] _at_ _this_ point [i] _for_ _one_ am worried _about_ every aspect 
B|13| B: [right] especially _uh_ [you] since you're _in _the_ same_ metroplex [you know] _there's_ [so] much [going] [on] _here_ . 
A|14| A: [i think] [the] drive by shootings _are_ _getting_ _to_ be [so] common _that's_ [really] _a_ _something_ [you] _got_ _to_ protect yourself _from_ . 
B|15| B: [well] [that] [and] _in the_ schools too starting [to] put metal detectors [in] 
A|16| A: _uh-huh_ golly _i [know_ .] 
B|17| B: [and] 
A|18| A: have _they_ done [that] [in] garland ? 
B|19| B: [no i] _not_ [that] _i'm_ aware _of_ . 
A|20| A: _now_ _um_ 
B|21| B: _i just_ heard [you know] _last_ week [at] [that] [one] _school_ [they] started putting _them_ [in] because _there_ _was_ [that] [one] shooting 
A|22| A: _right ._ 
B|23| B: [so] [um] 
A|24| A: [well] we _had_ _a_ vice principal _shot_ [at] [here] [last] year [on] [the] [you know] [on] [the] [school] grounds after [school] . 
B|25| B: _is that_ [right] ? 
A|26| A: [and] [the] [one] boy killed _himself_ _a_ few years ago [in the] [in] _a_ grade [school] [so] [you know] _these_ kids [don't] have any trouble _getting_ _a_ hold [of] guns [in] any [in] any neighborhood doesn't seem like . 
B|27| B: _uh-huh _._ yeah_ [yeah] . 
A|28| A: [so [.] yeah] _it's_ kind [of] scary [to] [think] [you] send your child [to] [school] [and] [you] wonder _if_ he's [going] _to get_ _shot_ . [i] mean we didn't have [to] worry _about_ [that] before . 
B|29| B: [i know] 
A|30| A: _what_ next ? 
B|31| B: [i know] [it's] [it's] [it's] [getting] [it's] [been] [out] [of] hand [i think] [for] [a] while [and] [it] _just_ continues [to get] worse . 
A|32| A: _right and_ [you know] we can't [really] depend [on] [the] police [to] solve _all_ _this_ [they] [just] can't do _it ._ 
B|33| B: [yeah] . 
A|34| A: [i think] [it] goes _all the_ way back [to] [the] break _up_ [of] [the] _family_ [to] [a] certain extent 
B|35| B: [right .] 
A|36| A: [and] [uh] [and] how we [going] [to] bring [that] back together . 
B|37| B: [yeah] [that's] [i] [i] agree [i think] [that's] where [it] stems [from] _is that_ [and] [um] [you know] you've [got] [a] lot _of a_ lot _more_ women [that] [are] [working] nowadays [that] aren't home _with_ [the] children 
A|38| A: [uh-huh .] _right and_ 
B|39| B: [and] [that] may impact [it] as [well] . 
A|40| A: [i think] [so] [and] _and then_ [there's] [a] drop [in] [uh] [the] training [of] morals [really] [you [know] .] 
B|41| B: _right [right_ .] 
A|42| A: _these_ _some_ [of] _these_ young kids [you] read _about_ [just] doesn't bother [them] [to] kill someone [at] _all_ 
B|43| B: [yeah] 
A|44| A: [i think] [i think] years past maybe our criminals _had_ [a] little [more] morals [you know] wouldn't kill somebody [in] cold blood . 
B|45| B: [they] [don't] [think] twice _about [it_ [.] yeah] . either [that] [or] [i] [don't] [know] [if] [it] _happened_ [and] [it] [wasn't] as highly publicized as [it] [is] [now] [or] [what] [the] [what] [the] 
A|46| A: [i think] [it] [was] [just] rare [i] [really] do . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: my mother [well] she's like seventy-four [now] . she _when_ she [was] [a] young girl she _had_ [a] beautiful beautiful cousin [that] lived [in] california [and] she [was] dating _this_ millionaire's son _and he_ wanted [to] marry _her_ [and] she wouldn't marry him [and] [so] _he_ drove [out] [in the] country [one] _day and_ _shot them_ both [and] [uh]

A|50| A: [no] [i'm] [the] [one] 
B|51| B: [himself] [and] [her] ? 
A|52| A: [yeah] [that] must have [been] [at] least fifty years ago [or] [more] but [the] point [of] [the] _story_ [is that] [that] [was] [so] unbelievable [a] thing [in] those _days_ [that] [it] [was] [in] _all the_ papers _all_ over [the] country [for] weeks 
B|53| B: [oh] wow [i] bet . 
A|54| A: but [now] [you know] [you] wouldn't probably read [about it] [here] [in] texas 
B|55| B: [oh] [i know]
