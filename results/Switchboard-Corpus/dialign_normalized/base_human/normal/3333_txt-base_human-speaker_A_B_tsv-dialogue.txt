A|22| A: _right ._ 
B|23| B: _so [,_ um ,] 
A|24| A: [well ,] we _had_ _a_ vice principal _shot_ [at] [here] [last] year [on] _the [,_ you know ,] [on] [the] [school] grounds after [school] . 
B|25| B: _is that_ [right] ? 
A|26| A: [and] [the] [one] boy killed _himself_ _a_ few years ago , [in _the] ,_ [in] _a_ grade [school ,] [so] [you know ,] _these_ kids [don't] have any trouble _getting_ _a_ hold [of] guns [in] any [in] any neighborhood , doesn't seem like . 
B|27| B: _uh-huh _._ yeah ,_ [yeah] . 
A|28| A: [so [.] yeah _,] it's_ kind [of] scary [to] _think [,_ you] send your child [to] [school] [and] [you] wonder _if_ he's [going] _to get_ _shot_ . [i] mean , we didn't have [to] worry _about_ [that] before . 
B|29| B: [i know] 
A|30| A: _what_ next ? 
B|31| B: _i know [,_ it's] [, it's] [, it's] [getting] [, it's] [been] [out] [of] hand [, _i think] ,_ [for] [a] while [, and] [it] _just_ continues [to get] worse .

B|33| B: [yeah] . 
A|34| A: [i think] [it] goes _all the_ way back [to] [the] break _up_ [of] [the] _family_ [to] [a] certain extent 
B|35| B: [right .] 
A|36| A: [and [,] uh [,] and] how we [going] [to] bring [that] back together . 
B|37| B: [yeah _,] that's [,_ i] [i] agree [, i think] [that's] where [it] stems [from] , _is that_ [and [,] um [,] you know ,] you've [got] [a] lot _of ,_ [a] lot _more_ women [that] [are] [working] nowadays [that] aren't home _with_ [the] children

B|51| B: [himself] [and] [her] ? 
A|52| A: [yeah [,] that] must have [been] [at] least fifty years ago [or] [more] , but [the] point [of] [the] _story_ [is [that] [,] that] [was] [so] unbelievable [a] thing [in] those _days_ [that] [it] [was] [in] _all the_ papers , _all_ over [the] country [for] weeks 
B|53| B: [oh ,] wow [, i] bet .
