A|0| A: _well_ _what i_ believe _is_ one _of the_ major _uh_ things _that_ _is_ wrong _with_ _our_ public _school_ system _is_ _that_ _um_ _we_ _do_ not _have_ enough discipline 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: and _the_ parents _do_ not let _the_ teachers discipline _the_ children _the_ way _that_ _they_ need _to_ be disciplined right now . 
B|3| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh _._ i_ agree [with] _that ._ 
A|4| A: _uh_ when [i] went _to_ _school_ _i know i_ _was_ scared _to_ death about being disciplined 
B|5| B: _you_ were ? 
A|6| A: and _the_ discipline [that] my _daughter_ receives now _in_ _going to_ _school_ _is_ just totally different . 
B|7| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|8| A: [you] _know_ [you] just [you] did not _see_ [i] did not _see_ anybody _in_ my classrooms when [i] _was_ _going to_ _school_ _act up_ _the_ way [that] _kids_ _do_ these days _in_ _the_ classroom . 
B|9| B: _yeah ._ _yeah_ _yeah ._ _from_ [what i] understand [they] [act up] _pretty_ bad 
A|10| A: [yeah] that's right that's right . 
B|11| B: [what] [uh] _grade_ [is] _your_ [daughter] [in] ? 
A|12| A: my my daughter's [in] _the_ _um_ fourth [grade] 
B|13| B: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: and _um_ there's children [in] her classroom [that] just totally disrupt _the_ classroom where _the_ teacher cannot teach 
B|15| B: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ _yeah ._ 
A|16| A: and when [i] went _to_ _school_ [that] just _wasn't_ put [up] [with] . 
B|17| B: _oh_ no _uh-huh ._ [they] always _had_ _a_ paddle _in our school ._ 
A|18| A: [uh-huh .] _well_ [they] [they] just _don't_ _do_ [that] _any_ more . 
B|19| B: [i know] . 
A|20| A: _but_ _the_ [school] system's afraid _of_ getting sued and _um_ _all_ sorts _of_ lawsuits i'm sure because _of_ things like [that .] 
B|21| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah] _yeah ._ 
A|22| A: and [i] also believe _we_ _don't_ even though [i] feel like [i] pay [a] _good_ share towards _the_ [school] system [that] _the_ teachers are still underpaid and _we_ still _don't have_ enough money towards put [in] toward public [school .] 
B|23| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: and _um_ _i think_ [that] _if we_ [had] enough money and paid _the_ teachers [a] little bit more [that] maybe [that] could solve some _of_ [our] problems . 
B|25| B: _yeah ._ [wasn't] [that] [what] part [of the] lottery [is] [going _to] go for_ [if we] approve _it_ ? 
A|26| A: yes supposedly that's [what] it's suppose [to go for] and [you] [know] _we'll_ just _have_ [to] wait and _see_ whether that's approved or not . 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [you] _know i don't_ [know] [your] feelings toward [that [.] i] guess [we] shouldn't get into [that] _but_ _um_ and [what] else _um_ _i think_ [in] some ways [that] [they] need [to] be more careful [of the] teachers [that] [they] hire . 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [i] _have_ heard stories [uh] [from] other parents [that] [i know] [of] their children are [in] high [school] [that] teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] no . really ? 
A|32| A: _oh yeah_ 
B|33| B: ooh . 
A|34| A: i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high [school] teachers 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: and [you] [know] [to] be be more careful [of the] teachers [that] [we] place [in our school .] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] [um] . 
A|38| A: [um] that's basically about _all_ [that] [i know] [that] may be wrong [with] [the] [school] system [. _i] think_ [with] [what] [they] _have_ [to] work [with] _i think they're doing_ [a] [pretty] _good job_ right now . 
B|39| B: [oh] [i] [do] too [i think they're doing] _real_ [good job] . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh] so . 
B|41| B: [but] then [what] [do] [i [know i] [don't] have] [any] [kids] . no none at [all] 
A|42| A: [yeah] _okay_ so this [is] probably [a] [real] hard subject [for] [you] . 
B|43| B: [oh yeah] 
A|44| A: [yeah .] _okay_ _well_ [i] guess [um] [we] can discontinue [our] call now . 
B|45| B: [okay] . 
A|46| A: _it was_ [a] joy [in] _talking_ [with] [you] . 
B|47| B: [well] [it was] [good] [talking] [to] [you] too . 
A|48| A: [okay] thanks . 
B|49| B: [we'll] [see] [you] bye-bye . 
A|50| A: bye .
