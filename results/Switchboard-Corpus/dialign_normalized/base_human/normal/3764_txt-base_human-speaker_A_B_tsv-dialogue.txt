A|10| A: [look] _professional_ 
B|11| B: _yeah_ . unfortunately .

B|13| B: uh-huh . 
A|14| A: _but_ [then] [when i] travel _it_ [is] _a little_ different situation . 
B|15| B: [yeah ,] [sure .] uh-huh . [yeah] . [yeah] . [uh [,] uh ,] [do you] find _that [,_ uh ,] _on the_ average [do] _people_ give [uh ,] _more credibility_ _or_ less _credibility to_ _a professional_ [, uh ,] [to] professionally dressed _individual ._ 
A|16| A: [yeah [,] i] think _in_ today's society [, uh ,] there [is] [more [credibility] to] be quite honest 
B|17| B: uh-huh . 
A|18| A: [i] will always remember [, i] will tell this real quick story [when i] graduated from college , [my] first job years ago [, uh ,] thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago _, in_ fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|19| B: uh-huh . 
A|20| A: [i] worked [for] [the] [, uh ,] smith douglas division [of] borden chemical [and] [i] sold [uh ,] _you know ,_ manure . 
B|21| B: uh-huh . 
A|22| A: _and [, uh ,_ i] _would_ _go_ out [and] call [on] _farmers_ [and] [i] _would_ always try _to [look_ my best] wearing sport coats [and] things _like_ [that _,] but_ [i] was calling [on] guys [that] wore bib overalls . 
B|23| B: uh-huh . 
A|24| A: [and [so] ,] one day [i] got up [and] thought [well] [i] will _just_ _go_ casual [and] _you know_ [that] [i] called [on] [a] guy wearing exactly [that ,] bib overalls _, and_ he sort [of] told _me_ [that] he expected _me_ [to] be [professional] 
B|25| B: uh-huh . 
A|26| A: [and] he sort [of] expected _me_ [to] [dress] as [a professional] 
B|27| B: oh , really ? 
A|28| A: [so [,] uh _,] it_ was sort [of ,] 
B|29| B: _even_ [the] [farmers] . 
A|30| A: [you] bet [even] back [then] 
B|31| B: oh , wow . 
A|32| A: [so i] sort [, uh ,] _been_ aware [of] [my] [dress] ever since [then] [and] try _to [look_ my best] , 
B|33| B: uh-huh . 
A|34| A: _but_ here again [i dress] casual quite [a] _bit_ [so ,] 
B|35| B: uh-huh . [yeah ,] _certainly_ . 
A|36| A: _it_ gives [you] confidence . _in_ [my] business _if i_ call [on the] [the] j c penney company here _in_ dallas [or] say someone say sears [and] roebuck _in_ chicago , [then [i] wear] coat [and] _tie_ . _if i_ call [on] _just_ [, uh , a] normal _little_ dealer [of] mine [, i] might be casual . 
B|37| B: uh-huh . 
A|38| A: [i] call [on] oshman's sporting goods , again _, it_ may be casual [or] _it_ may be coat [and] _tie_ . [so] _it depends ._ 
B|39| B: [yeah [,] [it] depends .] [sure .] [uh ,] [so] [you] don't [, uh ,] [if] [you] had [the] choice [would] [you] [wear] [a] [tie] [or] _not_ ? 
A|40| A: [uh ,] probably _no_ . 
B|41| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
A|42| A: _but_ [then] [it depends] [on] who [you] _are_ calling [on] . who _you're ,_ [you] _like_ _your_ minister standing up _in_ front [of] [you] _with_ _no_ [tie] , [you] _just_ [, uh ,] he [would] be missing something . 
B|43| B: uh-huh . 
A|44| A: [although] , he shouldn't be evaluated [on] [that] . 
B|45| B: _right_ , _right ._ 
A|46| A: [so ,] it's its' _just_ different . 
B|47| B: uh-huh . [yeah ,] [that [,] uh ,] [if] [if] [you] wanted [to] [, uh [,] uh ,] really get into [a] hot issue [, uh] [well] at least [in] some [in] some beliefs [, uh ,] [how] _people_ [dress] [when] they _go to_ _church_ [is] [, uh ,] [is] [uh ,] sometimes [a] pretty , pretty hot [topic] . 
A|48| A: [yes [,] it] [is] [. _i] am , uh ,_ _like_ [a] catholic [and] [the] [people] [that] [go to] [my] [church] , _you know_ catholics [dress] very casual [a lot [of] the] _times_ . [people] [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever _, but_ yet [the] way [i] was _raised_ [, i am a] converted catholic , [the] way [i] was _raised_ [, i] was _raised_ [a] baptist [and] _like_ as [a] youngster [i] use [to] always [dress] up all [the time [.] i] guess [that] has changed also . 
B|49| B: uh-huh [uh ,] [yeah] . i'm [, i am [, uh ,] i] [go to] [the] [church] [of] christ [. i] _have_ [been] [raised] [in the] [church] [of] christ [and , uh [,] _but] [, uh ,_ i] [, uh ,] too many [times] [you] hear [you] hear [a lot] _about_ _what_ _what_ [you're [,] uh ,] supposed [you're] supposed [to look] [your] sunday [best] [uh [,] uh [,] and] [dress] [and] proper attire 
A|50| A: [right .] 
B|51| B: [and , uh [,] and] sometimes [that] really disappoints [me] [, uh [,] in] [, uh ,] [when i] see [in] other economic areas [like] [in] kentucky . 
A|52| A: [sure .] 
B|53| B: [you know ,] [people] [just] don't _have_ [that] [and] they [are] afraid [to] [go to] [church] [or] afraid [to] [go] simply because they don't _have_ [the] clothes [to] [wear] . 
A|54| A: [but] . [that] [is] [a] very good point [. [i] am] from west virginia [so i] understand [what] [you] [are] saying there 
B|55| B: uh-huh . 
A|56| A: [and] it's it's [a] very good point . 
B|57| B: [yeah] . 
A|58| A: [but] [you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying , [you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|59| B: _certainly_ . 
A|60| A: [and , uh ,] evaluation [of] an [individual .] _course_ , all [of] [it depends] [on the] type [of] job responsibility [you] [have] [. i] think [you] [have to] [dress] sort [of] accordingly . 
B|61| B: uh-huh . 
A|62| A: [but , uh ,] [you] [certainly] should [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and , uh ,] [or] evaluate [a] person by [that] . 
B|63| B: uh-huh . 
A|64| A: [what] [about] season [to] season . does [, i] guess [your] [dress] changes . 
B|65| B: [uh ,] [yeah] [a little] [bit] . [uh [,] uh] [of] [course] [in the] summer [if i] can get away [with] [it] [, [i] wear] [, uh [,] uh , a] pair [of] shorts [and] that's [it] . run around barefoot , [no] [shirt] [or] anything [but , uh ,]
