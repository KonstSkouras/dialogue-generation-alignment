B|0| B: so let's talk _about_ _the_ _uh_ wonderful abuses _in _the_ state_ _of_ _pennsylvania_ _of_ personal property _taxes_ whereby _you_ _can_ purchase _something mail order and_ after _the_ fact _the state_ _of_ _pennsylvania_ _can_ _find out about it_ _and_ send _you_ _a_ bill _for_ _the sales tax_ appropriate _to_ _that_ item _that_ _you_ purchased as _well_ as interest _and_ _penalties_ _from_ _the_ time _that_ _you_ bought _it ._ _what_ _do_ _you_ _think_ ? _is_ _pennsylvania_ kind _of_ _out of line_ _there_ ? 
A|1| A: [well] actually _i don't think_ they're [out of line] . devil's advocate possibly _but_ [it] [you] _are_ trying [to] avoid _paying_ [taxes] [and] whether _or_ _not_ [you] agree _with that_ _law_ _you're_ still circumventing [it .] [you] _are_ legal [in] [in] your circumvention [of] [that] _law_ . 
B|2| B: _what_ _what_ _if_ [you're] [not] doing [it] _in order to_ circumvent _the_ [law] though ? _i mean_ _what_ _if you_ [don't] even _realize_ [that] [you're] subject [to] [paying] _uh_ income _tax on_ _something_ [that] [you] purchase _mail order_ ? 
A|3| A: really _i _i_ _i_ don't think_ _that's a_ valid argument _. _i_ think that_ most people _are_ quite aware they're [not] [paying] [that] _six percent_ [sales tax] . um naturally _some_ _some_ _things_ [you] just _can't find_ [in] your _local_ k-mart _or_ _or_ [uh] bryn mawr stereo dealer _. uh but_ _then_ why [not] _pay_ _pay_ [the sales tax] corporations have [to] why should an individual just _because it's_ just _because_ [the state] _can't_ really [find out about it] _be_ able [to] avoid _paying _sales tax_ ?_ 
B|4| B: [well] _i mean_ [it] seems [to] me [that] generally _at_ least [in] _my_ own experience when [i] purchase _something mail order_ _it's not_ [to] circumvent [paying sales tax] [to] [the state] [of] _pennsylvania ._ [it's] [because] _i'm_ sorry [the] commonwealth [of] _pennsylvania ._ 
A|5| A: yes . 
B|6| B: [uh] [it's] [because] [i i] [can't find] [the] item _that i_ want _at_ [a] competitive price anywhere [in] _my_ [local] area . so [i] go outside [the] area _for_ _that _._ and [i_ think that] _it's not_ _my_ _responsibility_ [to] police myself [and] _pay pennsylvania_ _what_ _they_ believe _they_ [are] owed even though [you] _know_ _the _revenue_ stream_ went [to] another [state] [. [i] don't] [i don't [think] that] _that's my_ _responsibility_ as [a] as [a] conscientious consumer . 
A|7| A: [i] i'll agree [it] [it's not] your [responsibility] _but_ [is] [it] also legal [for] [you] [to] _do that_ ? [from] [what] [i] understand [from] various net readings [it] [the] federal government [is] going [to] try [to] legislate [a] more aggressive enforcement _of state_ [tax] schemes [uh] [in] _into place_ [in the] next few years . [it] [is] [it] [is] [a] lost [revenue stream] _right_ now [and] states [can] use all [the revenue] [they] [can] get . _with_ _some_ _with_ [something] like [that] [do] your arguments still apply ? 
B|8| B: [well] [i think that] _if if_ policy [is] established [and] _if_ _a mechanism_ [is] put [into place] [to] promote [the] collection [of] [taxes] [in] _this_ fashion [then] [i don't] argue [with] [it .] [because [it's] not] [a] burden _on_ [the] consumer [to] remember [that] _oh i_ bought _this_ [out [of] state] [. i] need [to] xerox [the] receipt [and] make [out] [a] check [for] [six percent] [and] send [it] [to] _pennsylvania ._ 
A|9| A: which [is] exactly [what] _businesses do_ [at] [the] present . 
B|10| B: [right] _. but the_ point [is] _is that_ [businesses [do] _that] ._ [the] business [that] [you] purchase [the] thing [from] [is] responsible [for] collecting [the] appropriate [sales tax] [and] forwarding [it] [to] [the state] [in] question . [that's a] cost [of] doing business . [the] burden shouldn't [be] placed _on_ [the] consumer . 
A|11| A: [and [i] [i] i] was actually talking [about] [businesses] _purchasing_ [something mail order _and] then_ having having [to] [pay] [sales [tax] on] [it .] 
B|12| B: [uh] . 
A|13| A: [that's my] understanding _of the_ way _uh the_ way [it] works . usually [the] [the] person ordering doesn't [pay] [. but the] accounting department will [uh] suck up all [the] bills [at] [the] _end of the_ month [and] [realize] how much [they] have [to] [pay] [. and] [there] [there] [are] _some_ substantial nasty [penalties] um [if you] [if] [businesses] try [to] avoid [that .] 
B|14| B: [uh] [do] [you] _mean_ [businesses] [from] [the] point [of] view as [of] [of] selling [things] [to] [a] consumer [and then] _being_ responsible [for] [the [sales tax] ?] [or] [purchasing] . 
A|15| A: no . [businesses] [uh] [if] [purchasing] [things] [mail order] [if if] [i'm] [a] computer consulting firm [and i] _see_ these [this] great deal [on] forty-six mother boards [uh] [from] [from] say utah . um [i i] might buy [the] mother boards [from] utah [but] [then] still have [to] [pay pennsylvania] [sales tax] . [my] accounting department will [at] [the] _end of the_ month [. [i] think [that] [i] think] _that's the_ way [things] work [in] [pennsylvania [.] and i] [know] [they] work [that] way [in] [uh] say here [in] d c . 
B|16| B: _yeah ._ [see] [i'm] unfamiliar [with that] [because] [i don't] [i] never [see] [that] [end of the] business . 
A|17| A: [yeah .] 
B|18| B: so [my] only experience has been [from] [the] point [of] view [of] [a] consumer [. uh but] [if] [that's the] case [if] [the] business [is] responsible [for] policing themselves [then] [i think] [some] _well defined_ mechanisms need [to] [be] [in] [place] so [that] [uh the] opportunity [to] forget [that] [you] owe [sales tax] [for] [something] [uh] [can] [be] avoided . 
A|19| A: [that's] true . [a] [a] big hole does exist [right] now [uh] [in] [that] consumers [can] just say [oh [i] i] forgot [that .] [there] [there] [is] no [well defined] [mechanism] [at] all [and] [and] [that] [it] [is] [a] [a] loss [. [i] [i] think] [is that] [the] federal government will try [to] establish [a mechanism] just [to] [do] just [that] [in] [in order to] gain [the revenue] [that's] [being] lost [. uh] [i mean] [i [i] don't] [know] [if] [i] agree [with [that] [.] but] [it] [but]
