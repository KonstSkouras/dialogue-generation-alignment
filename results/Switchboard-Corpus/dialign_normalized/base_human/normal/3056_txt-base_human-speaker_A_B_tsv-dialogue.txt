A|6| A: _who_ _wrote_ [that] ? 
B|7| B: _oh _,_ i_ _do_ _not_ remember _the_ man's name , _he_ _was ,_ used _to be_ _a_ reporter _for_ _, uh _,_ i _think_ _,_ the_ new york times , _or_ _the_ washington post , _one_ _of the_ _two_ _, and_ _he_ _supposedly_ got _this_ _, this_ , _story _,_ uh _,_ i mean_ _this_ _, uh ,_ _was_ contacted _by_ _this_ guy [who] had these , these memos _he_ wanted _to_ sell _, and_ _they_ were _, they_ were ones [that] had _supposedly_ been stolen from _the_ _, uh ,_ corporate headquarters _in_ _, uh ,_ _in_ los angeles . 
A|8| A: huh . 
B|9| B: _they_ , _on_ _i think_ _it was_ romain drive _or_ romain street _or something_ , _there_ _in_ los angeles _, they_ used _to_ _have a_ , _or_ _, i guess_ _they_ still _do_ _, uh ,_ had _a_ _, uh _,_ uh ,_ big warehouse kind _of_ thing , which had offices _and _it_ was_ _sort of_ nondescript _for_ _a_ _, uh _,_ you know , for_ _the_ size _of the_ company which , inside _was_ basically _a_ store house _of_ _a_ bunch _of_ stuff _he_ collected , _he_ , _he_ _was _,_ uh ,_ _a_ great collector _of_ everything , _he_ , _he_ , _he_ _did_ _not_ , _he_ _did_ _not_ throw _anything_ away _and , uh ,_ _supposedly_ _this_ guy had , had been breaking _there_ _for_ _he_ _was a_ _, _like_ _,_ you know ,_ burglar , had been breaking _there_ awhile _and , uh , and_ had ended _up_ , 
A|10| A: [i] see . 
B|11| B: _he_ had some accomplices [that] were kind _of_ suspect _, and_ _they_ _, uh _,_ they_ broke _in_ _one_ , _one_ night _and_ found _a_ bunch _of_ memos [that] were _, uh ,_ _supposedly_ from , from hughes _to _,_ uh ,_ _to_ his main _, uh ,_ main assistant back _, uh ,_ _in the_ fifties _and_ _well _, i_ guess_ , _in the_ sixties , _up_ _until_ his death . 
A|12| A: [well _,] that is_ _interesting_ _. right ._ 
B|13| B: _so _,_ it's_ pretty [interesting] work _so ,_ 
A|14| A: _that is_ _an_ intriguing type [of] _book_ [to be] [reading] [and] _trying to_ keep [up] [on] _things_ [like] [that] . 
B|15| B: _yeah_ _, it's_ _a_ _, it's_ _a_ little _, it's_ _a_ little hard _you_ _have_ [to] plod through _it_ _and _,_ you know , it_ does _not_ _have a_ real _story ,_ _or_ any plot , 
A|16| A: uh-huh . 
B|17| B: _you_ _just_ kind [of] _have_ _to read_ [and] understand _what is_ going [on] . 
A|18| A: [and [,] they] _have not_ made [a] _movie_ [of the] week _of it_ _yet_ . 
B|19| B: _no_ _, _i_ [have_ not] seen _it ._ _but _it's_ _,_ but_ _it is_ _, it is_ real [interesting] , 
A|20| A: _yeah ._ 
B|21| B: _uh _,_ i_ also [reading] _, uh _,_ the_ _, uh _,_ it's_ [a] , [an] old , another old [book] [that] [i] happen [to] [have] . _i am_ _sort of_ rereading _it _._ _it's_ _,_ uh ,_ _a book_ _about _,_ uh _,_ the_ bermuda _triangle_ _, _but_ _it's_ _,_ uh _,_ it's_ _about _,_ it's_ [a] real _good book_ [that] [a] guy _, uh ,_ [wrote] [who] _was _,_ uh ,_ [a] research librarian , _he_ [wrote] _, uh ,_ _sort of_ debunking many [of the] _, uh _,_ uh _,_ the_ stories _about_ [the] _, uh ,_ bermuda _triangle ._ _you know ,_ _he_ , _he_ _was_ thinking many , many [of the] [the] myths , many [of the] myths [of _the] triangle_ were _, uh ,_ actually , _could be_ _explained ,_ 
A|22| A: [uh] . [explained ,] *listen; [could be] br 
B|23| B: [and _,] you know_ . _uh _, and_ the_ reason [i] _was ,_ picked [it] back [up] _was in_ light [of] all [the] _, uh ,_ [well] _when_ [they] found [the] _, uh _,_ the_ airplanes [on] [the] , _in the_ atlantic , thinking [they] were flight nineteen _. _and_ i_ don't _know_ _if_ _you_ _are_ familiar _with_ [that] at all _but _it's_ _,_ uh ,_ flight nineteen _was_ _one_ [of the] _, uh ,_ _was a_ , [a] collection [of] [a] flight [of] five navy adventures at [the] end [of] world _war_ _two_ [. right] after world _war_ _two_ _, and_ [they] were [, they] were lost _and , uh ,_ 
A|24| A: [supposedly] scooped [up] [by] [the [triangle] .] 
B|25| B: [yeah] [, they] were . 
A|26| A: _yeah ._ 
B|27| B: _and so _,_ and_ _in _the_ _book_ _,_ you know ,_ even , _he_ [wrote] _this_ [book] back _in the_ seventies _, and_ even _, and_ even then _he_ , _he_ had [a] very _good_ case _for_ [the] fact [they] probably _just_ got lost [and] [they] ditched _in the_ water _. _and ,_ uh _,_ because_ _he_ , _he_ mentions , _he_ , _he_ goes through [and] brings _out_ points from [the] navy's findings _and so_ forth _. _and ,_ uh _,_ it's_ probably _, you know ,_ real close [to] _what_ _, you know ,_ everyone [is] thinking , now _that [,_ they] _just_ got turned around [and] [could] [not] _find_ their _way_ back . 
A|28| A: _yeah ._ [on] [that] same topic , [have] [you] ever [read] [anything] [about [,] you know [,] the] amelia earhart [story ,] whatever happened [with] _her_ ? 
B|29| B: _uh ,_ _no_ _, _i_ [have_ not] . 
A|30| A: _i [, i_ think] [that] _would_ [be] _, i am_ sure [there] [is] [something] [out] [there] [, uh ,] , 
B|31| B: [yeah] [, i] [would] [i] [would] _like _to_ ,_ _too_ _, because_ _it's_ [a] lot [of] [things] coming [up] here lately [about] [her] [, you know ,] possibilities [of] [of] where _she_ , 
A|32| A: [i] thought [she] [was a] prisoner [of] [war] [or something] [for] [like] ten [years] . 
B|33| B: [uh] 
A|34| A: [well] whatever [, this] [is] [one] aspect _of [it_ .] 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: [of] course [, you know [, it] is] [so] weird _, cause_ [no] [one] _will_ ever _really_ [know [,] [it's] [,] _it] _,_ so_ [but it's] entertaining [and it] makes [you] [think] [about] [things] . 
B|37| B: [right .] 
A|38| A: _that is_ [for] sure . 
B|39| B: [yeah .] _so [,_ that is] pretty _much_ [for] [right] now [, that is] _, what_ _i have_ been [reading] . 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [i] kind [of] _like to read_ different stuff _and , uh [,_ _i] like to read_ [a] novel every now [and] then _, but , uh [,_ _i am] trying to_ get away from _just_ [reading] novels all [the] time . 
A|42| A: [right .] [well , _i] [, i_ guess] _i just _have_ not read_ [i mean] , _usually_ _, i just_ , [if] [i] [find] [a] [good [book] _,] i will_ sit [, you know , for] [two] days [until] [it is] finished . [if] [it's] [that] [good] , 
B|43| B: [yeah .] 
A|44| A: [and [i] think] [the] last [one] _i read_ [like] [that was] scott thurow's [and] [that was] presumed innocent . 
B|45| B: yes . 
A|46| A: [and _i] just_ _really_ , _really liked_ [the] [way] [he] writes [. it's] [just] , incredible . 
B|47| B: [yeah] [, [i] read] _that ,_ _too_ . [i] got [it [,] uh ,] [right] , after [it] came [out] . _my_ [, uh [,] you know ,] 
A|48| A: [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [he] [was] [an] , [an] assistant district attorney _in_ chicago at _, uh , and_ while [he] [was] writing _the [book_ _,] and , uh ,_ _my_ sister-in-law lives _in_ chicago _, and_ [she] had , before [it] actually got big , [she] sent _me_ [this] [book] saying [, you] might [like] [this] [, this] guy [is] [, you know ,] from here . 
A|50| A: [uh] . 
B|51| B: _and , uh [,_ [i] read] [it] [and] [really liked] [it] [and] then [about [,] that is] _when it_ [really] got big _. _and ,_ uh [,_ so] [i ,] 
A|52| A: [that was] [good] [, i think] [. and [,] and the] other [book] [i am trying to] [think [,] you know [,] like] [was [in] the] last year [and [i] think] [i] [did] [read] tom wolfe [and] _vanity [,_ uh ,] 
B|53| B: [of the] [vanity ,] 
A|54| A: bon [yeah .] 
B|55| B: _i [have_ not read] _that ,_ although [, _i] have_ heard [it is] pretty [good] . 
A|56| A: [uh] . [yeah] _i [, that_ was] [really] , [really] [good] [, _the] movie_ [was] nothing compared [to] [the book] . 
B|57| B: [yeah] [, that is] _what_ _i have_ heard . 
A|58| A: [and] . [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [i] saw [the movie] _, and , uh ,_ 
A|60| A: [oh [,] [the] movie] [was a] joke compared [to [,] i mean] [, because] tom wolfe [is] [so] perceptive , [when it] comes [to [,] you know ,] pinpointing [, uh ,] society's ills [and ,] [things] [like] [that] [and] [just] nailing people [to] [the] wall [and] exposing [things] 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] right .] 
A|62| A: [and [,] [and] so [,] [it] [was] , [it] [was] a] [much] more intense [book] than [the] [sort of] flimflam [that] [they] cast off [in [the] movie] 
B|63| B: [right .] [i] [know] . 
A|64| A: [and ,] anyway , we [are] [not] talking [about] _that , but , uh ,_ gee _, i just_ [i like to read] gardening [books] [and] [things] [like] [that] . [just] [to] tell [me] [what] [to] [do] [with] [my] garden [and , uh [, and] , uh ,] 
B|65| B: [yeah .] _i have a_ lot [of] [, uh [,] uh ,] computer [books] [that] [i am] [, i] [do] computer work [and so] _i have a_ lot [of] those . [so [,] i] spend [a] lot [of] time looking through those , [not] necessarily [reading] them [but ,] looking through them . 
A|66| A: [yeah .] 
B|67| B: [but] [i ,] i'm interested [in] [a] lot [of] [that , but , uh [,] _i] have_ got [a] lot [of] [books] [that] [i , i] intend [to read] [, but] _i [have_ not] been able [to] [yet] [, you know , for] [one] reason [or] another . 
A|68| A: [like [,] [what] [is] [a] book] [on] your _list [,_ you know] [i _have a] list_ [too] [and i have] never [gotten] [to] [it] 
B|69| B: [oh ,] gosh [, i] [do] [not] [, i] [do] [not] [really] [have a [list] [,] cause] [i just] kind [of] [, uh [,] [i just] have] all [the] [books] [out] [, you know [,] [i] have] [book] shelves [and i have] them all [out] [and] [usually] [when] [i am] through [with] [one] [, i will] go [in] [and , uh [,] uh [,] uh ,] look , look through [, uh [,] [i] have] [one] now [and [i] , i] can [not] remember [the] name [of it] [that] [i , that] [i] got [is] [the] sister-in-law [in] chicago [usually] sends [me] [for] [my] birthday [or] , [or] christmas [or something] [will] send [me] another , another [good book] [and , uh [,] uh ,] 
A|70| A: [oh] . 
B|71| B: [i have] [one] [and i] can [not] remember [the] name [of [it] [,] uh [,] it is] supposed [to be] [a] mystery .
