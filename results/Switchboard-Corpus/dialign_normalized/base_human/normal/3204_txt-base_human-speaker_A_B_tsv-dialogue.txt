B|0| B: what _is_ _it_ _about nursing homes_ ? 
A|1| A: _well_ _about nursing homes _and_ and_ older _people_ . 
B|2| B: _yeah ._ 
A|3| A: _uh my_ husband has _a_ grandmother _that_ lives _with_ his _mother_ 
B|4| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _and_ _they're_ _just_ _really_ _close_ here . _and_ his _mother_ has bad health _too_ _and so_ _i_ _go_ over sometimes _in the_ day _when_ _he's_ _at_ work _and i_ um help _with_ her _and_ bathe her _and_ feed her . 
B|6| B: _right ._ 
A|7| A: _and uh_ _and i_ that's hard _to_ _be_ _a_ caretaker _i_ _really_ believe . _it's_ _really_ _difficult_ _to_ _be_ _a_ caretaker twenty-four hours _a_ day . 
B|8| B: _oh_ _it's very difficult_ _i know_ . 
A|9| A: _uh_ _she_ has alzheimer's _and_ does not remember _uh_ _a lot_ _if_ _anything ._ 
B|10| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|11| A: _and so_ _she_ asks _the_ same questions over _and_ over again . which [is] not _you know_ unrealistic . 
B|12| B: _right ._ 
A|13| A: um _and so_ _you just have to_ try _and_ _be_ patient _and_ answer _them_ again _or_ _just_ answer another question . 
B|14| B: _yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _uh i_ _uh_ some nights his _mother_ calls _me_ _and_ says _can_ your family _and_ _just_ bring _the_ kids _in the_ family _and_ _just_ come over _and and_ visit grandma _because_ _she_ gets [very] disoriented . 
B|16| B: _yeah_ how old [is] [she] ? 
A|17| A: _she's_ _ninety-two_ . 
B|18| B: [uh my] _see_ [my] _father_ [is] [ninety-two] [and] still [uh] _he_ [and] [mother] still _live_ [at] [the] house [and] drive [and and] do [the] whole thing 
A|19| A: _oh _i_ think_ that's wonderful . 
B|20| B: _but_ [you know] [if] _something_ _would_ [uh] whenever _something_ happens [to] one _of_ [them] _then_ _i don't_ [know] what i'll do up _there ._ 
A|21| A: _well_ [uh-huh .] 
B|22| B: _i i_ [just] [know] [that] [too] many horror stories [about nursing homes [and] so] 
A|23| A: [yeah .] [i] was [just] going [to] _say_ . 
B|24| B: [they're] [in] missouri [and i] _could_ _i _i_ know_ _i know_ stories _for_ _sure _that_ they_ [just] _they_ _they_ [just] [well] _they_ can't take [the] proper _care_ _of_ _them ._ _most_ _of_ _them ._ 
A|25| A: [yeah .] um 
B|26| B: [and _uh] it's_ [it's] tragic [that] [you know] [when] [people] _live_ [so] long _that they_ [uh] _don't_ _have a_ [really] _don't_ _have a_ _place to_ [go] . 
A|27| A: yes . 
B|28| B: [so] 
A|29| A: _uh i think_ [it's] wonderful these these _places_ [that] aren't [nursing homes] necessarily [but] [they] _can_ [go] [and] reside [there] like _little_ apartments _places_ [in] between _places_ . 
B|30| B: _right ._ 
A|31| A: [and i] like [that] idea _if they_ _can_ handle [it] _themselves ._ um 
B|32| B: [yeah] there's one [very] [close] [to] where [my] _parents_ _are_ [but] [uh i think] [it] _would be_ nice [but] [my] dad's [the] type _he_ wouldn't want [to] spend [the] money on [anything .] 
A|33| A: [yeah] [yeah] 
B|34| B: [so] [uh i] mean [he's] _from_ [that] old depression era [and uh] _you know it's_ [oh] [it's] [just] blissfull [that] [they're] both able [to] do everything _for_ [themselves .] 
A|35| A: [yeah .] 
B|36| B: [i] _would_ imagine [that] i'll [uh] [if] _something_ happens i'll move one _of_ [them] [or] [you know] [in] [in] [with] [me] . 
A|37| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|38| B: [so] [uh] 
A|39| A: [yeah .] 
B|40| B: [but] _i know [a_ lot] _of_ [people] [have] said [that] _and then_ _find out_ how tough _it is_ [and] [but] [i think] _you'd_ [have to] [really] [they] also wanted us [to] talk [about] _you'd_ [have to] [really] check on [the] [uh] on this _homes ._ 
A|41| A: [nursing [homes] .] 
B|42| B: [but] [i] [just] _don't_ [know] how much [you] [can] _see_ [when] [you] [go] _for_ [a] 
A|43| A: visit . 
B|44| B: [i think] [you just have to] drop [in] all unexpectedly [a lot] . 
A|45| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|46| B: [and so] many [people] [when] [they] put [people] [in the] nurses _home_ [they] never _see them ._ 
A|47| A: [they] [don't] [go] [and] [see them .] that's [right .] 
B|48| B: [they] never [go] [to] [see them .] 
A|49| A: that's [right .] 
B|50| B: i've talked [to] many [uh] owners _of_ [places] [and] _say that_ nobody even _maybe_ _maybe_ christmas . 
A|51| A: [you know] um [i [i] think] [nursing homes] [are] [are] um some [are] _good_ 
B|52| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|53| A: [i] [have to] [say that] . 
B|54| B: [right .] 
A|55| A: [but] [for] [the] [most] part [i] truly believe [that] [the] [parents] [would be] better _if they_ were [with] [the] children . 
B|56| B: [oh i] do [too] . 
A|57| A: um 
B|58| B: [or] [if] [if they] _could be_ real real nearby where [they] _could_ [see them] everyday [or] _so ._ 
A|59| A: [right] [right .] 
B|60| B: [uh] [because] _i know_ governor richards [is] [really] upset [about] what [she's] finding [in the] [nursing homes] [uh] regulation [in] texas [so] _maybe_ we'll get [it] improved . 
A|61| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|62| B: _so ._ 
A|63| A: [i] _hope_ [so .] 
B|64| B: anyway . 
A|65| A: [you know it's] [i think] [it's very difficult] [in the] first [place to] make [that] choice [to] [have] [them] [go] [there .] 
B|66| B: [right .] [oh] [it's] tough _i'm sure_ . 
A|67| A: [and then] [if] [you] [find out] [that they] [are] not having _good_ [care] [you know] [i'm [sure] that] [it is] [just] [you know] [you'd] pull [them] [out] [of] [there] [so] fast . 
B|68| B: [oh] . [right] [that] [would be] devastating [i'm sure] [so .] 
A|69| A: [and uh] [and] yet [if] [you] didn't feel like [you] [could be] _a good_ caretaker [i don't] [uh it's] [a] [very] [very] hard _decision_ [i think] . 
B|70| B: [it is] [a] tough [decision] [and] [it's] one [that] _needs_ [a] great deal [of] thought [and] prior probably . 
A|71| A: [uh-huh .] [i think] that's [right] 
B|72| B: [yeah .] 
A|73| A: [and] especially [if] you're not [a] person [that] [is] like [a] medical person [maybe] [or] [something] [that] [the] person [needs] medical treatment . 
B|74| B: [right .] 
A|75| A: now [i know a] friend [of] mine who had [a] [father] [uh] [she] brought [to] her [home] [uh] [to] [live] [there] [but] [he] needed [the] medical treatment [and] [she] had [a] [nursing] person come [in] like three times [a] week [to] [to] help him [out] . 
B|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|77| A: [and] [that] might [be] [a] partial solution [or] [something] . 
B|78| B: [right .] 
A|79| A: [but] um [i] personally am [for] [the] trying [it] [at] [home] caretaker part before [i think] i'd ever 
B|80| B: [i] [would] [hope] _we_ [could] do [that] [and then] [go] _from_ [there .] 
A|81| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|82| B: [well] anyway 
A|83| A: [well] [i [i] think] [we] kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|84| B: we've covered [a] [little] bit [and [uh] it's] _good to hear from you_ [and] 
A|85| A: [good to hear from you] . 
B|86| B: _have [a_ good] 
A|87| A: [have a] lovely day . 
B|88| B: [have [a] good]
