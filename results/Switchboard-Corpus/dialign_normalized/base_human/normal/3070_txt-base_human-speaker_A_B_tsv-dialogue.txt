B|28| B: uh-huh .

B|38| B: [so] _they_ _they_ take _their_ [family] . 
A|39| A: [right .] 
B|40| B: [but] [uh] let's [see] [that] _would make_ _them_ grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather _okay _so_ it_ _would_ be _the second_ great grandchild . _and so_ _they_ 
A|41| A: [okay so] [this] town [hall] [that] [you] meet [in] _is_ [that] _like_ [a] [um] 
B|42| B: _well _it's_ a_ community center _it's a_ community [hall] . _it's a_ great _big_ open building [that] has [a] _wonderful_ kitchen _it_ [in] 
A|43| A: [okay] . 
B|44| B: _and uh_ [you] [just] bring [the] covered dishes . _every every_ [family] brings _a a_ dish [of] some _kind_ _and _you_ get_ [all the] _wonderful_ old [family] recipes [that] [have] _been_ handed _down_ [for] _years_ 
A|45| A: _potato salad_ [and uh] 
B|46| B: [well] [we] try _to_ stay _away from_ those _things_ which might [have] [uh] salmonella [in] _them ._ 
A|47| A: [oh] [that's] [good] . 
B|48| B: [and] [we] choose _to_ bring congealed [salad] . [you] can bring [a] congealed vegetable [salad] _as_ opposed _to_ [potato salad] . 
A|49| A: [right .] 
B|50| B: [and] [we] [are] very conscious [of] most [of us are] very conscious [of] [of] [uh] sanitation aspects whatever you've got _to_ carry [for] any distance . 
A|51| A: [right .] 
B|52| B: [i] [always] take _home_ baked _bread_ . 
A|53| A: [oh] [that's] nice . 
B|54| B: [uh] [that] happens _to_ be [my] specialty [for] [that] [family] _. i_ [do] other _things_ very [well] 
A|55| A: [right .] 
B|56| B: [but] [there] [are] others _in the family who_ [do] _them_ better . 
A|57| A: [do] [they] [always] [have] _the the_ [one] person [in the family who] knows _or_ everyone thinks [they] _know_ _how_ [to] [make] [this] [the] best [so] _that's what_ _they get_ [to] cook . 
B|58| B: uh-huh . 
A|59| A: [well] [that's] [good] _. [well_ i] _had a_ professor [in] anthropology _at_ school [who] studied [family] _reunions_ _so i_ learned [a lot] [about] [them [.] _i] haven't_ [been] [to] [a lot] 
B|60| B: uh-huh . 
A|61| A: [but] [we] _talked_ [a lot] [about] _the the_ rituals 
B|62| B: uh-huh . 
A|63| A: [you] [all] equated [the family] _reunions_ [as] _with_ [the] protestant . 
B|64| B: uh-huh . 
A|65| A: _it [was_ the] protestant version [of the] catholic pilgrimage . 
B|66| B: uh-huh . 
A|67| A: _it was_ _it was an_ interesting theory . she _talked_ [about] [the] [uh] [the] catholics [all] [it's a] [home] centered _you know it's_ [all] [family] centered anyway _so you_ [usually] [are] living where [your] parents live [and] [it's] [all] [your] [you] _don't_ [have] [to] [come] [home] [so] [the] catholics [would make] [a] pilgrimage [in] [older] europe [but] _when_ [the] protestant ethic happened [in] america [there] were _people who_ ever went _out_ _and you know_ went [away from] [the family] [to] seek [their] fortune _and then_ _had to_ [come] _back_ [home] [for] [their] [reunion] [so] [that] became [their] version [of the] pilgrimage . 
B|68| B: uh-huh . [right .] 
A|69| A: [but] she _had_ _it was_ interesting _you know _i_ don't know_ _how_ valid [it] _is_ [but] she _talked_ [about] _that and_ _how_ _the the_ [big] picnic table [was the] symbolic communion [of the] [people] gathering [together and] [um] _you know_ [about] [the] [bread] [and the] ritual placement . [do you [have] [a] a] certain way [that] everything _is_ placed _out_ _on the_ table [every _every] year_ ? _is_ [there] _kind of a_ _you know_ salads go [first] [and] [things] _like_ [that] ? 
B|70| B: _well it's_ [uh] [we] [have] [uh] [uh] [kind of a] core group [that] [that] serves [as] quote officers [of the] organization 
A|71| A: [right .] 
B|72| B: [and] [they] plan [the] [reunions] [the] organize [the] [you know] [who] [is] going [to] [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot gets [there] who's going [to] rent [the] tables who's going [to] [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware gets turned [back] _to the_ caterer . [uh] [and] each [year] [it's] _done_ [a] little bit differently because different [people] serve [in] those roles . 
A|73| A: [well] [that's] pretty . 
B|74| B: [we] [have a] biographer [who] [who] continues [every year] [to] save clippings [on] any [family] member [and] [they're] entered into [a a] _wonderful_ [uh] scrap book . [and] pictures [of] new babies [and] new [people who] [have] [been] added [and] [and] obituaries [to] those [who] [are] gone . [and] [it] keeps [the family] alive even [you know] even though [it's] very fluid . 
A|75| A: [sure] [does] . [that's] _wonderful ._ 
B|76| B: [and] [they're] very dedicated [to] [that [and] uh] [it's] [been] [really] [wonderful .] [it] helps [you] hang onto [your] roots . 
A|77| A: [yeah] [. i] wish we'd 
B|78| B: [and] [it] helps [you] feel [a] strong sense [of] belonging . [my] husband [on the] other hand [was] [not] very close [to] his [family] . his [family] [was] very [scattered] [and] very diverse . 
A|79| A: [right .] 
B|80| B: "and [i] asked him [i] got [to] talking [to] him [i] said [well] [how] [is] his nephew doing . ""well [i don't [know] [i] haven't] [talked] [to] [my] brother [in] three _years_ . "" [i] said ""well how's [your] brother doing ? "" ""i [don't know] . "" [uh] [you know] [my] son keeps [in] touch [with] him [i] think [but] [i don't] . " 
A|81| A: [right .] 
B|82| B: "i said ""hey wouldn't [you] [like] [to] [know] what's happening [with] these [people] ? "" ""yeah [but] i'm [you know it's] too [much] trouble . "" [so i] got busy got [together and] put [a] [reunion] [together] [for] his [family] . [and] succeeded [in] getting [all] [of] his brothers [and] sisters [and] [all] [of] [their] offspring [but] [one] [to] _our_ [place] _down_ [at] lake tawakoni . " 
A|83| A: wow . _you're_ [just] [uh] [oh] [that's] incredible . 
B|84| B: liked [to] kill me because [i] [it was] [i] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation [i] did [it] by myself . 
A|85| A: [right .] 
B|86| B: [and uh] nobody brought covered dishes _. _we had_ a_ great [big] fish fry [and [you know] i] fixed [a] [salad] [in a] number three tub . 
A|87| A: [right] 
B|88| B: [and] [and uh] [it was an] enormous task [to] bring [all] [of] those [people] [together] [with] [just] [one] [or] two [people] helping . [and uh] _we [had_ to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] [all] [of] [them] [and] [i] told him 
A|89| A: [have] [you have] [you] [done] [this] repetitively [or] [just] once ? 
B|90| B: "we did [it] [that] [year] _and then the_ following summer [we] did [not] [have] [all] [of [the] family] [there] _. we_ sent invitations _. we_ said ""please let [us] [know] if [you're] coming . "" [it was] [when] [uh] his mother his step father [had] died [the] [year] before" 
A|91| A: [oh] . 
B|92| B: [and] [it] his mother [was] alone _and so_ [they] came [to] support her [and then] [one] by [one] his [you know] his sisters he began [to] lose [family] members 
A|93| A: [see] [that's] we've [we had a] problem [with] [that] . 
B|94| B: [and] [it was] difficult [to] hold [them] [together .] [and then] [of] course he died two _years ago_ [so [you] know] [that] [family] has gone _down_ [to] [one] brother [and] [one] sister now . 
A|95| A: [oh] . 
B|96| B: [and uh] [it] [i] think [that's what] happens [when] [they get] [scattered] [the [the] family] unit [you know] falls into disrepair . 
A|97| A: [right .] [that's] [our] [was] [our] problem [. we had] [uh] [the first] [reunion] [or] [the first] [you know] major [reunion] [was] probably six [or] seven [years ago] . 
B|98| B: uh-huh . 
A|99| A: [and then [the] second] [reunion] [people who] maybe [you know] [had] sacrificed [things] [to] [come] [to [the] first] [one] thought [oh] [well it's] [not] [that] [big] [a] thing [this year] 
B|100| B: uh-huh . 
A|101| A: [and [so] it] [kind of] wound [down] 
B|102| B: uh-huh . 
A|103| A: [and then] finally [you know] [you're] lucky [to] [get] [you know] [you get] [the] shreveport relatives [there] [but] no [one] else [so] [that] 
B|104| B: uh-huh [. well] [see] [we] manage those [people who] [are] [at] [that] core group manage [to] keep keep [the] vigor alive . they'll send [out] news bulletins . two [or] three times [a] [year] you'll [get] [a] news hey guess [who] got [you know] elected [to the] legislature [or] guess [who] [our] local sheriff
