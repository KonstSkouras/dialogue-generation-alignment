A|0| A: _so _,_ what_ _do_ _you _think_ about_ _a year_ _or_ _two_ _of_ public _service_ ? 
B|1| B: _well _,_ _i_ know_ _it's_ hard _for_ _young people_ _to_ [think about] giving _up_ _their_ _years_ _, you know _,_ their_ _carefree_ _years_ 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _but_ _people_ _that_ _i_ _have_ _known_ _that_ _have _done_ _that_ ,_ _like_ _from_ _other_ countries , especially _, from_ germany _and_ finland _, um , they_ _are_ _just _,_ they_ _have such a_ better , more mature , outlook _on_ _life_ 
A|4| A: _yeah ._ _yeah ._ 
B|5| B: _and i think_ _they're_ better _people_ _because _of_ _it_ ,_ 
A|6| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: _they're_ _much_ more responsible _. i _know_ _,_ um _,_ the_ _church_ _that_ _i_ go _to , um _,_ the_ _young_ men give _two _years_ of_ _their_ _life_ _when_ _they_ turn nineteen _, you know ,_ 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: _they're_ encouraged _to do_ _that ,_ missionary work _, and i_ _i really_ believe _that the_ _people_ _that_ [do] _that_ _are_ better _people_ _that_ _make_ _our_ , society better . 
A|10| A: _you know _, i_ , [i_ really] agree _with_ _you ._ _um _, i_ _,_ uh ,_ though _i've_ never [done that] myself _, i ,_ i'm , _was_ [a] basically _an_ education major _when i_ graduated [from] college [and i] accepted [a] job [that] _at_ [the] _time_ _was_ [just] slightly above [the] poverty level [to] teach [to , um ,] very rural children _in a_ very low income district [and i] spent _a year_ teaching _there_ 
B|11| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [and i think] [it] _was_ probably one [of] _my_ largest eye-opening experiences [because] _i come_ [from] nice middle class white suburban _home_ 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [and i] did [it [,] um _,] for_ one reason [i] _wanted_ [, _i] was_ working [on] [a] masters degree _so_ [i] _wanted to_ stay close [to] where _i was_ working [on] [a] masters degree _, but_ also [because] [i] [just] thought _that it would_ _be_ interesting [to] live _some_ place else _so_ totally different _than_ _my_ _own_ [up] bringing 
B|15| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: [and _i] _,_ it_ changed _, it_ probably changed _my_ political views [it] changed _my_ understanding _of the_ world around me 
B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: [and _i think] [,_ um _,] in_ fact _, if_ _i had_ _to do it_ _all_ again _i [,_ you know ,] _after_ [that [,] you know [,] you] never [think] [of _it] because _,_ i guess_ [because] [i] paid [for] _all_ [of] _my_ college education myself [, i] never thought [about] _doing_ [that] [because] _i had_ _all_ these college loans i'd started paying back . 
B|19| B: huh . 
A|20| A: [um ,] _so_ [that] _was_ _, that_ _was_ one reason _why_ [i] never considered [it] [but] now [that] i'm further along [, and] i'm _still_ paying these college loans _, i _, i_ think_ realistically [, you know [,] _you] can_ [have] _your_ college loans delayed now _, because_ _i had_ _them_ delayed [because] i'm back _in_ graduate _school_ _at_ thirty [years] old , 
B|21| B: [yeah .] 
A|22| A: _um , _i_ had_ _them_ delayed [because] i'm back _in_ graduate _school_ [and] [on] [that] form [it] says _if_ _your_ joining [the] peace corps _you can_ [have] _them_ delayed 
B|23| B: huh _. and_ rattling [in] 
A|24| A: [and i] thought [that] _was_ [, you know ,] very interesting [and _i] , i_ _would_ [have] thought [of] [that] earlier [i] probably _would_ [have done] [, you know ,] [just] [like] , _is_ [that ,] _is_ _this_ , _is_ [that the] mormon _church _,_ that_ does [that] ? 
B|25| B: yes . yes . 
A|26| A: [because] one [of] _my_ neighbors _, uh ,_ did [that] [in] pittsburgh [, from] pittsburgh . 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and i] thought [, you know _,] that_ _really ,_ now [that] i'm thirty [years] old _, _i think_ that_ one _or_ [two years] _out_ [of] _my_ [life] _would_ [have] , probably [like] [you] said , _to be_ able [to] travel _some_ place else whether [it] _be_ [the] united states _or_ outside [the] _country _,_ i think_ _it would_ [have] been [a] very _good_ [, um ,] experience [for] me . 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] _well [,_ i think] [so [,] it] puts [you] [out] [on] [your] [own] [and] [and] [in a] [time] [after] _high school_ [, um ,] there's kind [of] [a] selfishness , 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [i] mean , teenagers _in our_ [country] _are_ kind [of] , kind [of] [a year] [that] parents _don't_ look forward [to] _and , and_ _things_ [like] [that] 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: [and [i think] [that] it would] _help_ _people_ [to] become , less self-centered [, and] [to be] more responsible [when] you're [out] [on] [your] [own] trying [to , um ,] thinking less [of] [your] [own] _needs_ [but] , [of] _other people_ . 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah [.] [and] _i think] [,_ you know _,] we_ [have such a] _need_ now _, you know , i_ taught _, you know _, i_ [, i_ think] _i was_ paid _, uh ,_ [about] nine thousand dollars [to] teach [for] [the] [year] 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [and i] worked [in a] very rural [school] district [and _i] _, i_ ,_ one _of the_ [things] [i] taught _was_ [a] computer class 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [and] these _kids_ _, um , you know ,_ every girl [i] taught , except [for] one , _was_ pregnant . 
B|39| B: _oh ,_ no . 
A|40| A: _many_ _of the_ boys [in] [the] room _had_ children _and they_ were [, they] were [high school] juniors . 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [and i] [just ,] _there_ [, you know [,] they] came [from] poverty [, they] were _going to_ condition [in] poverty [and] [it] _was_ [, it] _was_ [, the] [school] district couldn't hire _many people_ [, it] _was_ very difficult [for] _them_ [to] hire [, [and _i] think] [,_ you know _,] in_ [the] sense _, that_ aspect [of] public _service_ [for] education [in] _some_ _of the_ inner cities _for [,_ um ,] [just] social workers [in] _some_ _of the_ inner cities [and] _some_ _of the_ rural areas where _they just_ _need_ advice [on] medical [, um ,] [things] [, i _think] it's_ [a] [really] _good_ _idea_ [. and] even _if_ _it is_ overseas . 
B|43| B: _right . uh-huh ._ 
A|44| A: see [, i] never _, i , i_ tell [you] sometimes [i] worry [about] [things] over seas [because] _we_ [have such] problems [right] _here_ [in our] [own] [country] . 
B|45| B: yes . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [it would] [really [,] um [,] and i] _don't_ [the] [people] [that] [i've] _known_ [like] [from] germany [and] finland [that] [have [done] that] _are_ [, they] [do] _military_ [service] which [, you know , i] _don't_ exactly recommend 
A|48| A: _yeah . uh-huh ._ [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [but] [still] [they] [have] benefited [from] [it] . 
A|50| A: [right . uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: _and [, um ,_ you know ,] although [i] wouldn't want [it] [to] _make_ [people] [to] go off [to] _the military_ voluntarily [but] [it's] [, _it] has_ helped [them] 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and they] _are_ [just] _a lot_ more mature , [than] [the] average student 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [and] [like] she's washing 
A|56| A: [yeah [.] [i] think] [it would] also [help] [them] _if_ [they] then went [on] [to] college [. i _know] _that_ my_ first couple [of] [years of] college were [, um _,] uh ,_ probably _too_ [carefree] _at_ [the] , beginning 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [and] then _at_ [the] end _i had_ [to be] _too_ serious . 
B|59| B: _well _,_ that's right ._ _a lot of_ [people] [they] flunk [out] [or] [they] get [, [they] just] get [so] excited [to be] away [from] [home] [, [they] just] _spend_ [all] [there] [time] partying 
A|60| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
B|61| B: [and they] [do] _a lot of_ [things] [to] themselves [that [,] _that] we_ [really] _don't_ want [our] _young people_ [to be] [doing] 
A|62| A: [yeah] [, _that's] true ._ 
B|63| B: _and ,_ 
A|64| A: [uh-huh] [, that's right .] 
B|65| B: [um] . 
A|66| A: _i ,_ [yeah] _, i think [,_ i think] _this_ _was_ , _this_ _was_ [a] very interesting topic _uh , because_ [it's] something [that [,] you know _,] we_ [don't] talk [about] _in this country_ probably _enough_ . 
B|67| B: [yeah . uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: _uh [,_ you know ,] 
B|69| B: [because] we're [so [,] we] love [our] freedom [and] [our] freedom [of] choice _and , um ,_ _having_ [people] [like] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [, _that's] true ._ 
B|71| B: [but] [, you know ,] [our] , [like] [in our] [church [,] [it] [,] [it] is] , [your] free [to do] [that] [or] not 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: you're encouraged [to do [it] because [,] um , you know [,] [it] [,] it] helps [you] [, _and] ,_ [of] course [, we] [think it's] helping _other people_ . 
A|74| A: _oh [, i_ think] [it is] . 
B|75| B: [and] [so ,] 
A|76| A: [i really] _think _,_ i think [,_ um ,] [people] [, you] should _, i [,_ you know [,] the] _kids_ today [i] teach [, i] [spend] [a lot of] _my_ [time] teaching college students 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [and _, um ,] i_ find great disgust [in] [them] _, _in_ their_ _, _in_ their_ [, um [,] their] self-centeredness [and] [their] inability [to] understand [, um ,] multicultural [or] multiracial situation 
B|79| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [and [i] [really] [,] you know _,] they don't_ understand _, uh ,_ _how_ [other people] live [, um _, they] don't_ understand , 
B|81| B: [and] _they're_ preoccupied [with] , drinking . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [, i _think] that's_ _, uh ,_ [just] [having] [a] _good_ [time] . 
B|83| B: [uh-huh [.] and] 
A|84| A: _i _,_ uh _,_ a_ friend [of] mine [is] [a] psychologist [and] he always refers [to] [it] as short-term pleasure oriented [. _i] guess_ he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] [it [,] you know ,] 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: today's [young people] [are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|87| B: [that's true .] paper 
A|88| A: [and] everything [has] [to be] _an_ immediate reward [and] [it has] [to be] fun . 
B|89| B: [that's] [really] [true .] 
A|90| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|91| B: [yeah .] _well [,_ i , i] [don't] [know] [how] [that] [would] ever happen [here] [but] [at] least [, um ,] 
A|92| A: [well _,] they say_ [, i think] [i [,] um ,] [have] read recently [that _,] uh [,_ the] bush administration [has] increased [the] funding [for] [the] peace corps . 
B|93| B: [oh ,] [really] . 
A|94| A: [uh-huh .] [because] _i guess_ [because _of] the_ changes [in] eastern europe _, uh ,_ they've increased funding [for] [the] peace corps . _some_ _of the_ _, i guess_ [it's] _some_ _of the_ peace dividend [in] [the] sense [, you] [known] , 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [when] [they're] decreasing _some_ _of [the_ military] spending , _some_ [of] [that] _money_ [has] gone into [the] peace corps 
B|97| B: huh . 
A|98| A: [and] _some_ _of the_ [are] [the] overseas programs . _uh ,_ 
B|99| B: [well [,] i] [have] seen [a] big change [, i think [,] in] [high school] [kids] [that my] relatives [and] friends [, [that] [,] um , [i] know] [when [i] was] [in] [high school] [i had] [an] [idea] [of] [what] [i really] [wanted [to] do] [with] [what] [my] [, what] [i was] [going to] study 
A|100| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [and] [at] least [i had] [some] interest _in [,_ [a] lot [of] the] youth [that] [i come] [in] contact [with] [are] [, they say] [oh , i] want [to be] [a] doctor [, i] want [to be] _a lawyer_ . [why] ? [because] [they] _make_ [a lot of] [money] . 
A|102| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [, [that's] true .] 
B|103| B: [and [they] don't] [have] [a] goal [, they don't] [have] [a] goal [, they don't] [have] [an] interest [in their] [own] field [of] study . 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: [they're] [just] looking what's [going to] pay [the] biggest cash . 
A|106| A: [yeah] [, that's] very [true .] [you know ,] [how] _many_ , [is] [it] [they say] [we] [have] [so] _many_ _lawyers in this country [,_ and _i] guess_ [, i , i] live near washington , being [in [,] in] baltimore , [it's] something [like] one [in] four [people] [, in] [the] washington , area , [are] _lawyers_ , 
B|107| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [and [, and] i] [just] sort [of] _think that's_ ridiculous . 
B|109| B: yes . 
A|110| A: [yeah] , [with] [with] [the] great [needs] [that we] _need_ today [in] science [and] biology [and _,] uh [,_ you know [,] the] [, the] problems [we] [have] [with] aids [and] cancer [and , and] [how] [come] everybody [is] [a lawyer] [, you know [,] you know] 
B|111| B: there's [just] [too] [many people] [. uh-huh .] [that's right .] not [enough] [people] want [to do] [that] [to [,] [for] [,] [uh ,] [because] of] [a] [service] [that] [they] could provide . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|113| B: [you know [,] if] [you] want [to be] [a lawyer] [because] [you [know] that] [you can] provide [a] [service] [that] [people] [need] [because] [you] [have] [to] [have] [lawyers in this country [,] um [,] but] [if] you're [just] [doing] [it because] [you [think] that's] [the] best way [to ,] [be] rich . 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [, you] saw , statistics [that] [lawyers] [and] doctors [make] [the] most [money] [in] [the] long run . 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [yeah] [, [that's] true .] 
B|117| B: [that's] kind [of] sad . [well ,] anyway . 
A|118| A: [that's] interesting [. uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [well [,] i guess] [i] better go .
