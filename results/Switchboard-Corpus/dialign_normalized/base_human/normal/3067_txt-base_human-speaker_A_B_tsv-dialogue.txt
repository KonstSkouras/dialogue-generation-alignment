A|13| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|14| B: _so_ . _it_ _was_ _uh_ _it_ _was_ _a_ big deal _but_ _uh_ [they] _tried to_ [to] centralize _it_ [in] _one_ spot . _so_ _in the_ past _couple of years_ _they had_ _it_ _at a_ state park _every year_ . 
A|15| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._

A|19| A: [is] [it] choice [or] _just_ business [or] 
B|20| B: _not_ getting _to go_ . 
A|21| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|22| B: _uh_ [just] _uh_ _the_ distance _involved_ _and_ 
A|23| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|24| B: _uh_ [just] _not_ _i_ _have a_ younger daughter now _and uh_ _i_ _it's_ _kind of_ hard [to] _get_ _her_ _get_ _her_ _there_ _and_ everything . 
A|25| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|26| B: _but_ _i_ am _going to_ [to] _uh_ hopefully _next year_ _get_ _to [go_ back] cause _uh_ _a_ lot _of the_ [family] has _not_ _uh_ _on_ _her_ _side_ _my_ _mother's side_ has _not_ seen [you] _know_ _my_ daughter _so_ 
A|27| A: oh . [do] [you] [have] _brothers and sisters_ ? 
B|28| B: _i_ [have] _one_ _brother_ _so_ . 
A|29| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh [._ and] [is] your _mother_ _still_ living ? 
B|30| B: _yes_ . 
A|31| A: oh [so] [so] [you] [go back] [and] visit _with_ [her] anyway . would [you] [not] ? 
B|32| B: _right_ yeah . 
A|33| A: _i mean_ either _way_ [there] [was] [family] [reunion] [time] [or] [not] 
B|34| B: _right_ [i] [i] _usually_ see [her] _a couple_ times _a year_ [so] _that's_ no no big thing . _but_ _uh_ [i] _uh_ _i do_ _i do_ enjoy _the_ [reunions] . _the_ _only_ problem _is that_ now _uh_ originally _when_ _we_ _had_ _them_ _uh_ _they were_ mainly _my_ _mother's_ 
A|35| A: _relatives_ _right ._ 
B|36| B: _uh father's_ . _my_ _mother's_ _father's family_ _had_ quite _a_ few _uh_ [brothers and sisters] . 
A|37| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|38| B: [so] [it] [was] _a_ large [reunion] _of_ _of_ _of_ _that group_ _uh_ [from] _that_ descendants . 
A|39| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|40| B: _and uh_ _a_ lot _of_ those _people_ [have] [and] _at_ [time] [you] _know_ [they] [all] knew _one_ another . 
A|41| A: [right] _right ._ 
B|42| B: [and] now [it] has gotten _uh_ _that_ _uh_ _a_ lot _of_ those _people_ _are_ [have] _uh_ [have] _died_ off [or] [you] _know_ _what_ _we are_ _left_ [with] [is] _the_ _the_ [relatives] _of_ _of_ _of_ _that group_ . 
A|43| A: [the] [next] generation _uh-huh ._ 
B|44| B: _and so_ _uh_ _it's_ [not] quite _as_ _close_ _as _it_ used to be_ . [so] _i think_ _people_ _feel_ _less_ _of_ _a_ desire [to] _really_ [go] _. i_ _know_ _that_ 
A|45| A: why [do] [you] _think that_ [it's] [less] [close] than [it used to be] ? 
B|46| B: _well_ [i] [i] [just] [think that] _uh_ [you] _know_ _at_ [that] _when_ _when_ _they were_ [you] _know_ [the] those [were] [all] [brothers and sisters] _a_ lot [and] [or] _they were_ [all _in] the_ same geographical _location_ . 
A|47| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|48| B: [you] _know_ [back] around [you] _know_ _in the_ twenties [and] thirties _when_ _they were_ growing _up_ _uh_ [you] _know_ _they were_ [all] located _together_ [in] _one_ small community . 
A|49| A: [right] _right _._ right ._ 
B|50| B: [and] _as_ _as_ [time] grew [i mean] _when_ [time] went _on the_ [family] grew [and] moved away _and so forth [._ and] now _when_ [they] come _together_ [it's] [it's] generally [you] _know_ [like] say [the] kids _of_ those _people_ who _are_ [not] [you] _know_ anywhere near _one_ another _and _i_ do not_ [think] [they] _feel_ [the] [the] closeness [that] [they] [used to be] [there] . which [is] _a_ shame 
A|51| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|52| B: _but_ _that's_ [just] how [it] [is] . _my_ [mother] [was] complaining _last_ _year_ _about_ [you] _know_ [it's] dwindling down _every year_ [you] _know_ _that's_ [just] _i think_ _that's_ [just] 
A|53| A: [is that] [just] family's lack [of] priority anymore maybe [yes] [we] [get] [so] [involved] [in] [our] work lives [and] [just] social lives [and so forth .] 
B|54| B: _well_ yeah . yeah _that's_ _uh_ yeah _i think_ _that's_ some [of] [it] . _but_ [you] _know_ [i] [have] _uh_ [i] [i] [it's] [just] _the way_ [you] _know_ _i think_ society [is] now [is _that] _we_ are_ [not] [we] _do not_ [have] [the] extensive _family we_ [used to] . 
A|55| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|56| B: [it's] more [of] _a_ [you] _know_ _a_ smaller smaller unit [and] [you] _know_ [we] [we] tend [to] try _to do_ things _i think_ [with] [our] immediate [family] _as_ opposed _to the_ extended _family ._ [of] _people _that_ we_ may [or] may [not] remember [or] _know_ [you] _know_ very _well_ . 
A|57| A: [right] _right ._ 
B|58| B: _uh_ 
A|59| A: [it] [really] makes an _effort_ [on] [to do] [this] anymore . 
B|60| B: [right] [it] requires _a_ lot [of] [effort] [to] [to] [to do] [that] sort [of] thing . 
A|61| A: [right] _right ._ 
B|62| B: [i mean] [i] [i] [used to] enjoy _going_ [i mean] [i] [still] [do] _kind of_ enjoy [it] _but_ _uh_ [it's] [it] does [not] [it's] [not] _as_ many _people_ [there] [that] [i] [really] [really] enjoy seeing . 
A|63| A: [right] _right ._ 
B|64| B: [you] _know_ [i] [it's] _going_ [just] _for_ [the] sake [of] getting _together_ _i think_ _for_ [the] _family [._ and] 
A|65| A: [do] [you] correspond [with] anybody [other] than your [mother] [and] [brother] [that's] _in [that_ group] ? [on a] regular basis [not] [just] christmas cards . 
B|66| B: _uh_ um um no [not] [really] _. [in_ that] _but_ [then] again _uh_ _well_ [i] [you] _know_ [i] [have] some aunts [that] _uh_ [i] [i] _i do_ . [that's] _about_ _my_ _mother's_ [sisters] [you] _know_ 
A|67| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|68| B: _but_ [i] _feel_ _closer_ [to] _them_ _because_ [i] _kind of_ grew _up with_ _them_ . _but_ _but_ _uh_ _as_ [you] _know_ _for_ [the] rest [of] [that group] no [not] [really] . 
A|69| A: _right ._ 
B|70| B: _uh_ [you] _know_ _and and_ generally _when_ [i] [was] growing _up_ [a] lot [of] those _people_ [the] _only_ [time] [i] ever saw _them_ [was] _at the reunion_ [so] _uh_ 
A|71| A: [right] _right ._ 
B|72| B: _you do not_ [really] _feel_ _that that_ [really] [close] [to] _them_ . 
A|73| A: _right [._ in] [my] [my] [uh [father's] [family] we] [get] [together] [every year] [at a] [different] [location] either dallas [or] oklahoma city . [they had] chosen santa barbara california [for] [this] summer [and and] [did not get] enough [people that] [were] willing [to go] [that] far [because] most [of] us live either [in the] midwest [or] [like] [in the] texas oklahoma area . 
B|74| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and uh] [so] [they] cancelled [that] [one] [and uh] [are] looking [next year] bringing [it] [back] [closer] [but] [we] [have a] letter [a] [family] letter [that] circulates 
B|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|77| A: [and it] [usually] goes through me twice [a year] [and] [what] [you do] [is] take [out] [the] [last] letter [you] wrote [that's] [on the] bottom [and] put [the] your new letter [on the] top [and] [then] [that's] [the way] [it's] kept [in] order [. and] [then] [about] twice [a year] [then] [you] [are] kept [up with] [what] [is] [going] [on] [and] [when] [you] meet [them] [at the reunion] [you do not] [feel] [like] [i do not] [know] anything [about] [this] person . [you] [have] read something [about] [what] [is] [going] [on] [and] [about] their children [and so forth .] 
B|78| B: [that's] [a] good idea . 
A|79| A: [so] [you] [are] [kind of] half [way] acquainted [that] [way] . 
B|80| B: [right .] 
A|81| A: [and] [that] [that's] been [a] [that's] been [a] nice [way] [of] keeping us [all] aware [of] each [other] [i think] . 
B|82| B: yeah [. right .] 
A|83| A: [we] [tried to] start [that] [in] [my] husband's [family .] his [mother's side] decided [they were] [going to] [have a] [reunion] [a [couple] of years] ago [and i] said [well] let's start [this] letter [and it] [just] never [my] husband's [sisters] started [it] [and] sent [it] [to] us [and that's] [as] far [as it] got [. i] sent [it] [on] [to the] [next] [one] 
B|84| B: yeah . 
A|85| A: [and and] [but] [we are] [going] [in] [a [couple] of] weeks [to the] [next] [one] [in] scottsdale arizona [for] [that] [family .] 
B|86| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: [we are] real glad [we] got [together] [because] since [that that] [time] [there] [were] [only] [like] two [of the] [one] sister [and] [one] sister-in-law [of the] original [family] [left] [. and] [the] sister-in-law [died] [and] [the] sister [is] [in] [a] nursing home [so] [we are] glad [that we] took [that] opportunity two [years] ago .
