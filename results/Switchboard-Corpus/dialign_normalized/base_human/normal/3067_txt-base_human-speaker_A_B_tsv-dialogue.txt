A|9| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|10| B: _uh _,_ that's_ where _the_ [family] grew . 
A|11| A: _just_ [from] city [to] city _then_ . 
B|12| B: yeah _, and it_ _was_ _not_ _only_ [in] mississippi _, in_ some _other_ places , _as_ _well_ , 
A|13| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|14| B: _so_ . _it_ _was_ _, uh ,_ _it_ _was_ _a_ big deal _, but_ _, uh ,_ [they] _tried _to_ _,_ to_ centralize _it_ [in] _one_ spot . _so _,_ _in_ the_ past _couple of years_ _they had_ _it_ _at a_ state park _every year_ . 
A|15| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|16| B: _we_ rent _a_ pavilion _and , and_ [do] _that_ _and that's_ _usually_ works _out_ _to be_ pretty good _. _and ,_ uh ,_ [they] will rent _a_ pavilion _on a_ weekend _, and_ _uh_ 
A|17| A: [do] _you_ _go back_ ?

A|19| A: [is] [it] choice [or] _just_ business _or ,_ 
B|20| B: _not_ getting _to go_ . 
A|21| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|22| B: _uh ,_ _just _,_ uh ,_ _the_ distance _involved_ _and ,_ 
A|23| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|24| B: _uh ,_ [just] _not _,_ i_ _have a_ younger daughter now _and , uh _,_ i_ , _it's_ _kind of_ hard [to] _get_ _her_ , _get_ _her_ _there_ _, and_ everything . 
A|25| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|26| B: _but_ _i_ am _going _to_ _,_ to _,_ uh ,_ hopefully _next year_ _get_ _to [go_ back] , cause _, uh _,_ a_ lot _of the_ [family] has _not _,_ uh _,_ on_ _her_ _side_ _, my_ _mother's side_ , has _not_ seen _, you_ _know_ _, my_ daughter _, so_ 
A|27| A: oh . [do] [you] [have] _brothers and sisters_ ? 
B|28| B: _i_ [have] _one_ _brother_ _, so_ . 
A|29| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh [._ and _,] is_ your _mother_ _still_ living ? 
B|30| B: _yes_ . 
A|31| A: oh _, so [,_ so] [you] [go back] [and] visit _with_ [her] anyway . would [you] [not] ? 
B|32| B: _right ,_ yeah . 
A|33| A: _i mean ,_ either _way_ [there] [was] [family] [reunion] [time [,] or] [not ,] 
B|34| B: _right _,_ i_ _, i_ _usually_ see [her] _a ,_ _couple_ times _a year_ [so] _that's_ no , no big thing . _but_ _, uh _,_ i_ _, uh _,_ i do_ _, i do_ enjoy _the_ [reunions] . _the_ _only_ problem _is that_ now _, uh ,_ originally _when_ _we_ _had_ _them_ _, uh ,_ _they were_ mainly _my_ _mother's_ 
A|35| A: _relatives_ , _right ._ 
B|36| B: _uh , father's_ . _my_ _mother's_ _father's family_ _had_ quite _a_ few _, uh ,_ [brothers and sisters] . 
A|37| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|38| B: [so ,] [it] [was] _a_ large [reunion] _of ,_ _of ,_ _of_ _that group_ _, uh ,_ [from] _that_ descendants . 
A|39| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|40| B: _and , uh _,_ a_ lot _of_ those _people_ _have _,_ and_ _at_ [time _,] you_ _know_ , [they] [all] knew _one_ another . 
A|41| A: [right ,] _right ._ 
B|42| B: [and] now [it] has gotten _, uh _,_ _that_ _,_ uh _,_ a_ lot _of_ those _people_ _are_ _have _,_ uh ,_ [have] _died_ off [, [or] _,] you_ _know_ , _what_ _we are_ _left_ [with] [is] _the ,_ _the_ [relatives] _of ,_ _of ,_ _of_ _that group_ . 
A|43| A: [the] [next] generation , _uh-huh ._ 
B|44| B: _and [so_ _,] uh ,_ _it's_ [not] quite _as_ _close_ _as _it_ used to be_ . [so _,] i think_ _people_ _feel_ _less_ _of_ _a_ desire [to] _really_ [go] _. i_ _know_ _that ,_ 
A|45| A: why [do] [you] _think that_ [it's] [less] [close] than [it used to be] ? 
B|46| B: _well_ _, i_ _, i_ [just] [think _that] _,_ uh _,_ you_ _know_ , _at_ [that] _when_ , _when_ _they were_ [you] _know_ , _the ,_ those [were] [all] [brothers and sisters] _a_ lot [and] [or] _they were_ [all _in] the_ same geographical _location_ . 
A|47| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|48| B: [you] _know_ , [back] around _, you_ _know_ _, _in_ the_ twenties [and] thirties _when_ _they were_ growing _up_ _, uh _,_ you_ _know_ , _they were_ [all] located _together_ _, in_ _one_ small community . 
A|49| A: [right ,] _right _._ right ._ 
B|50| B: [and] _as_ , _as_ [time] grew _, [i_ mean] _when_ [time] went _on the_ [family] grew [and] moved away _and so forth [._ and] now _when_ [they] come _together_ [it's] , [it's] generally _, you_ _know_ , [like] say [the] kids _of_ those _people_ who _are_ [not _,] you_ _know_ , anywhere near _one_ another _and _i_ do not_ [think] [they] _feel_ _the ,_ [the] closeness [that] [they] [used to be] [there] . which [is] _a_ shame 
A|51| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|52| B: _but_ _that's_ [just] how [it] [is] . _my_ [mother] [was] complaining _last_ _year_ _about_ [you] _know_ , [it's] dwindling down _every year_ _, you_ _know_ _, that's_ _just _,_ i think_ _that's_ [just] 
A|53| A: [is that] [just] family's lack [of] priority , anymore , maybe [yes] _, we_ [get] [so] [involved] [in] [our] work lives [and] [just ,] social lives [and so forth .] 
B|54| B: _well_ , yeah . yeah _, that's_ _, uh ,_ yeah _, i think_ _that's_ some [of] [it] . _but_ _, you_ _know_ _, i_ _have _,_ uh _,_ i_ _, i_ , [it's] [just] _the way_ _, you_ _know_ _, i think_ society [is] now [, [is] _that] _we_ are_ [not [,] we] _do not_ [have] [the] extensive [family] [we] [used to] . 
A|55| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|56| B: [it's] more [of] _a _,_ you_ _know_ _, a_ smaller , smaller unit _, and_ [you] _know_ [, we] [, we] tend [to] try [to] [do] things _, i think_ [with] [our] immediate _family ,_ _as_ opposed _to the_ extended _family ._ [of] _people _that_ we_ may [or] may [not] remember [or] _know_ _, you_ _know_ , very _well_ . 
A|57| A: [right ,] _right ._ 
B|58| B: _uh_ 
A|59| A: [it] [really] makes an _effort_ [on] [, to ,] [do] [this] anymore . 
B|60| B: [right ,] [it] requires _a_ lot [of] [effort] [to [,] to [,] to] [do] [that] sort [of] thing . 
A|61| A: [right ,] _right ._ 
B|62| B: [i mean _,] i_ _, i_ [used to] enjoy _going_ _, [i_ mean] [i] [still] [do] _kind of_ enjoy _it _,_ but_ _, uh ,_ [it's] , [it] does [not ,] [it's] [not] _as_ many _people_ [there] [that] [i] [really] , [really] enjoy seeing . 
A|63| A: [right ,] _right ._ 
B|64| B: [you] _know_ _, i_ , [it's] _going_ [just] _for_ [the] sake [of] getting _together_ _, i think_ _for_ [the] _family [._ and ,] 
A|65| A: [do] [you] correspond [with] anybody [other] than your [mother] [and] [brother] [that's] _in [that_ group] ? [on a] regular basis _, not_ [just] christmas cards . 
B|66| B: _uh ,_ um , um , no [, not] [really] _. [in_ _that] _,_ but_ , [then] again _, uh _,_ well_ _, i_ _, you_ _know_ _, i_ [have] some aunts _that _,_ uh _,_ i_ _, i_ _, i do_ . [that's] _about_ _my_ _mother's_ [sisters] _, you_ _know_ , 
A|67| A: _uh-huh_ , _uh-huh ._ 
B|68| B: _but_ [i] _feel_ _closer_ [to] _them_ _, because_ [i] _kind of_ grew _up with_ _them_ . _but_ _, but_ _, uh ,_ _as_ _, you_ _know_ _, for_ [the] rest [of] [that group] , no [not] [really] . 
A|69| A: _right ._ 
B|70| B: _uh _,_ you_ _know_ _, _and ,_ and_ generally _when_ [i] [was] growing _up_ [a] lot [of] those _people_ , [the] _only_ [time] [i] ever saw _them_ [was] _at the reunion [,_ so _,] uh_ 
A|71| A: [right ,] _right ._ 
B|72| B: _you do not_ [really] _feel_ [that] [that] [really] [close] [to] _them_ . 
A|73| A: _right [._ in] [my] [, my] [, [uh ,] [father's] [family] [,] we] [get] [together] [every year] [at a] [different] [location] , either dallas [or] oklahoma city . [they had] chosen santa barbara , california [for] [this] summer [and , and] [did not get] enough [people that] [were] willing [to go] [that] far [, because] most [of] us live either [in the] midwest [, or] [like] [in the] texas , oklahoma area . 
B|74| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and , uh [,] so] [they] cancelled [that] [one] [and , uh ,] [are] looking [next year] bringing [it] [back] [closer] [, but] [we] [have a] letter [, a] [family] letter [, that] circulates , 
B|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|77| A: [and it] [usually] goes through me twice [a year] [and] [what] [you do] [is] take [out] [the] [last] letter [you] wrote [that's] [on the] bottom [and] put [the ,] your new letter [on the] top [, and] [then] [that's] [the way] [it's] kept [in] order [. and] [then] , [about] twice [a year] [then] [you] [are] kept [up with] [what] [is] [going] [on] [and] [when] [you] meet [them] [at the reunion [,] [you] do not] [feel] [like] [, [i do] not] [know] anything [about] [this] person . [you] [have ,] read something [about] [what] [is] [going] [on] [and] [about] their children [and so forth .] 
B|78| B: [that's] [a] good idea . 
A|79| A: [so [,] you] [are] [kind [of] ,] half [way] acquainted [that] [way] . 
B|80| B: [right .] 
A|81| A: [and] [that [,] that's] been [a [,] that's] been [a] nice [way] [of] keeping us [all] aware [of] each [other] [, i think] . 
B|82| B: yeah [. right .] 
A|83| A: [we] [tried to] start [that] [in] [my] husband's [family .] his [mother's side] decided [they were] [going to] [have a] [reunion] [a] [couple of years] ago [, [and] i] said [, well] let's start [this] letter [, and it] [just] never [my] husband's [sisters] started [it] [and] sent [it] [to] us [and that's] [as] far [as it] got [. i] sent [it [,] on] [to the] [next] [one] , 
B|84| B: yeah . 
A|85| A: [and [, and] [,] but] [we are] [going] [in] [a] [couple of] weeks [to the] [next] [one] [, in] scottsdale , arizona [, for] [that] [family .] 
B|86| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: [we are] real glad [we] got [together] [because] since [that [,] that] [time] [there] [were] [only] [like] two [of [the] ,] [one] sister [and] [one] sister-in-law [of the] original [family] [left] [. and] [the] sister-in-law [died] [and] [the] sister [is] [in] [a] nursing home [, so [,] [we] are] glad [that we] took [that] opportunity two [years] ago .
