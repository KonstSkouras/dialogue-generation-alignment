A|0| A: _yeah_ _, _i_ think_ _, um_ , _this_ _is a_ tough subject because _, uh ,_ _when_ _you_ come from _two different parts of the _country_ _,_ uh ,_ _the_ political views _are_ _really_ _different_ . _i_ _, uh , i_ _, i_ guess i've _had_ _to_ discuss _a_ number _of_ _what_ might _be_ considered controversial issues , 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _i_ guess _like_ , _like_ they're _nothing_ _, i_ guess , _nothing_ _is_ _as_ awful _as_ abortion _but_ _like_ _gun control_ _and _,_ uh ,_ _day_ care an things _like_ _that_ _, and_ _there_ _are_ some _very_ _different_ views _, uh _,_ _of_ the_ people connected _with the_ program _which_ _i_ thought _was_ _really_ interesting _, _you_ know_ . 
B|3| B: _well ,_ _now_ [you] [, you] _say_ [two different parts of the country] [what] , [are] , [are] , [are] [you] referring _to yourself_ _or_ , 
A|4| A: _yeah_ _, well_ being _in_ , _in_ baltimore see , maryland _is_ _, um_ , _is_ sort [of] _, um_ , _is_ _as_ , _as a_ hub [of] liberalism _you know_ , compared _to [the_ _country] _,_ uh [,_ _you] know_ , _very_ _, uh ,_ _in_ , _in_ many ways _, uh ,_ _very_ _liberal_ _very_ somewhat [to] _new_ england _though_ pennsylvania _and_ _new_ york _, uh , i_ , aren't actually _as_ _liberal_ , maryland _is a_ _very_ _liberal_ _, uh ,_ state _so_ , _so_ , where _here_ _we have_ _, um_ , _we have_ _gun control_ laws _we_ probably _have_ some [of the] strictest _gun control_ laws _in the_ nation _and_ most people _in_ maryland vote _for_ _that_ [, _you] know_ . 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _so_ _, it_ _really_ _is a_ [different] _, um_ , 
B|7| B: [uh _,] well [,_ of] course [, you] _talk_ [gun] controls _down_ [here] [in] texas [and] you're asking _to be_ lynched . 
A|8| A: _yeah_ , _that's_ , _that's_ _right_ [talk] [to] _, i_ _had_ [to] [talk] _about_ _gun control_ _with_ somebody _and i_ talked _with_ _a_ woman who actually [, _you] know_ , _had_ _just_ purchased _a gun_ _that_ _day_ _, and_ _was_ going target shooting [, _you] know_ , 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [and] _it_ _was_ _very_ [different] _it_ _was_ _a_ whole , [different] view _. it's_ _really_ _, um_ , _this_ _has_ opened _my_ eyes [to] thinking [, _you] know_ , at _one_ time _i_ _just_ sat [here] [and] thought [, well ,] _how_ _can_ anybody _believe_ _that_ because i'd _really_ never met people _that_ _did_ _, and_ _now _,_ i_ [talk] [to] people _that_ _do ._ _so_ _that's_ _, it's_ _really_ interesting . 
B|11| B: [well [,] _it's] _very_ true_ , [now] _i'm_ _a [,_ uh ,] [new] yorker by birth . 
A|12| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: although [i] claim florida [as] [my] home [now [,] uh , i] [have] [two] sons living _down_ [there] _but i_ _also_ [have] [two] sons living elsewhere , [one] [in] tennessee , [one] [in] mississippi . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: _but i_ lived [in] [in] florida [for] ten _years_ [and i] kind [of] [like] [it] _down_ [there] _, but they_ [had] [a [gun] control] law [which] went [a] little bit _too_ far . 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: _i think [uh_ [,] well] [in] _your_ words , _they_ were [a] little bit _too_ [liberal] . 
A|18| A: _yeah_ , isn't [it] funny . 
B|19| B: _i mean_ _they_ _they _i_ believe_ _if_ _i'm_ correct _i believe_ _they_ permitted _their_ carrying concealed weapons . 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: _but they_ [uh] quickly [did] away [with] _it ._ 
A|22| A: [uh] . _yeah ._ 
B|23| B: _i think [in_ the] next session _they_ _they_ [uh] modified [it] [but] [it's] _still_ legal [to] _own_ _or_ _possess_ weapons [in] _uh uh_ florida . 
A|24| A: _yeah_ [well] _you can_ [possess] 'em [here] [too] [but they] _have [to_ be] they're registered _and uh ,_ [like] [uh] _the the_ brady bill _that's_ currently being discussed nationally [and] whatever _is_ [very] [well] supported [here] , [in] [gun control] avenues , 
B|25| B: [the the] [one] week [uh] _seven day_ [the] delay 
A|26| A: [you] [have] [the] [seven day] waiting period . 
B|27| B: _uh huh ._ 
A|28| A: _yeah_ 
B|29| B: [well] _i don't_ mind [that] _too much_ 
A|30| A: _that's uh_ _that's_ 
B|31| B: _i'm_ _i'm_ [with the] n r [a] _myself_ . 
A|32| A: _yeah ._ 
B|33| B: [and uh [,] uh] [really] [the] _only_ objection [we have] [is] _uh _you_ you_ _give_ [a] little [and] next _thing you know_ _somebody's_ trying [to] take more . 
A|34| A: _yeah_ _that's_ [true] _that's_ [very true] _that's_ [and] _that's_ [the] way [i] guess most [of the] _um_ [the] political organizations work [you know] [the] same [i] [know] [the] abortion issue [with] _right_ [to] life [and] _right_ [to] choose 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: [and] [and] both [of] them [are] both want [the] extent [of] extremes _so_ [that] [they] [don't] [give] anything [for] [a] balance [you know] there's there's always [that] difficulty 
B|37| B: [well] _then_ _tell_ _me_ _do you_ _consider_ _yourself_ [a] [liberal] ? 
A|38| A: _um_ [i] _would_ [say] [i'm] probably [liberal] [yeah] 
B|39| B: [well] let _me_ ask _you this_ _then ._ 
A|40| A: [yeah] sure 
B|41| B: [how] [is] _your_ [what] [is] _your_ feeling [about] _uh uh_ expressing _yourself_ by _burning the_ american _flag_ ? 
A|42| A: [well] i'll [tell] [you] . _i [i_ think] [you know] [if] [they] [if] [they] didn't [give] [as] [much] coverage [to] these idiots [that] _burn _the_ flag_ _, it_ _would_ never happen [do [you] know] [what] [i mean] ? 
B|43| B: _huh ._ 
A|44| A: [it's] [only] because [they] make [a] big stink over [it .] [but _i] i_ guess actually [i believe] [that] [if] somebody wants _to burn _the_ flag_ [i] guess _that's_ [their] opportunity they're they're they're _right_ [in the] sense [of] _freedom of speech_ [but i] _would_ never 
B|45| B: [well] [now] wait [a] minute [there] 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [you] [just] said [it [.] it's] [their] [right] by [freedom of speech] ? [what] does [speech] [have _to] do_ [with] _burning_ [a] [flag] ? 
A|48| A: [yeah _.] well_ [it's] [that] [they [i] think] [the] idea [of] [freedom of speech] goes _back to_ [and i] [uh uh] [the [the] the] whole aspect [of] being able [to] display [your] [uh] [your] ideas [you know] [the] [what] [the country] stands _on_ america stands _on_ [is] [that] [they] _can_ [do] _that uh ,_ _though_ [i] _would_ never _even_ [consider] [it] [in] [a] million [years] [to _do] it_ [myself] _i _i_ [i_ think [uh] [you] know] [but _i] i still_ [what] _the flag_ stands [for] [i] guess _to me_ [is] [that] [if] somebody wants [to] voice [their] opinion [or] display [their] opinion openly [and] [if] [that] _is a_ [a] way [that] [they] _can_ show [their] opinion [then] [they] _should be_ allowed [uh] 
B|49| B: [now] [uh] [well] [i i still] go [back to] ... 
A|50| A: unless [the] _burn_ unless [the] actual fire hinders [somebody's] health [and] well-being [you know] [but [i] [i] think] _that's_ [i] guess _that's_ [i] _that's_ [my] opinion [yeah] [i] guess [you] feel differently . 
B|51| B: [then] [would] [you] condone [the] _burning_ [of the] capitol building ? 
A|52| A: [uh ,] _no_ [but [i] think] _that's_ _that's uh_ [it's] _that's_ taxpayer's money . [if] somebody buys [their] [own] [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] _that's fine_ [but] [that] _that's_ [you know] _that's_ destruction [and] [of] [uh] _public property and_ whatever . 
B|53| B: [uh ,] [then] _you don't_ draw [a] line between [public property [and] [uh] [uh] uh] [what] [a] [public] [uh] _symbol_ . 
A|54| A: _no_ [i don't] [know] [i] guess [the] symbolism oh [i think] [what] america stands [for] _is the right_ [to be] able [to] _disagree_ [with the] government . 
B|55| B: [uh] [yeah] 
A|56| A: [uh] [i think] _that's_ what's made democracy 
B|57| B: [but] [here] again [i] go [back [to] the] second amendment _you can disagree_ by [freedom of speech] [which] , [has] [nothing] [to do] [with] action . 
A|58| A: _yeah . uh-huh ._ [yeah _.] well_ _that's_ _that's_ [true] 
B|59| B: [now] [i] am [i] am adamantly against _that ._ 
A|60| A: [yeah] [but [i] think] [i i] [yeah] [i [i] i] guess [the] idea [you know] [they] always keep saying [like] [the] framers . _um_ . [there] [uh] [one] [of the] republican [the] appointees [for] [the the] judicial bench [and] [they] always [talk] [about] [they] feel [that] [this] person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what] [the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set [down] . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [and] _um_ [i believe] [that] [the] idea [of] [burning _the] flag_ [is] [is] [in] 
B|63| B: _huh ._ 
A|64| A: [my] understanding [of] [how] [it] _was_ framed [is] [that] [you this] [the] [thing] [about] _this country_ [is] [that] [you can disagree] [with] its government [and] [you can] display [that .] 
B|65| B: [yeah . uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [uh , i] [yeah] [, i] [and] [and] _so_ [that] _as a_ [freedom of] expression [and] [speech] [and] whatever [i [i] think] [that] _that's_ viable . _um_ [as] _long as it's_ [your] [flag] [and] [and] you've made [your] [your] point . [i think] . [yeah] because , realistically , [like] [for] [you] [for] [you [you] don't] [think] [it's] [right] 
B|67| B: _no ._ 
A|68| A: [and i] [would] never _do [it_ .] [i i] love _this country_ [too much] _, and_ [that] [symbol] means [a] lot _to me_ . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: _um_ . [but i] guess [it's] [just] [one] [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] _that's_ what's something [it's] [a] need [for] them [you know] . 
B|71| B: [well] [here] again [we] [uh] [even] [though] [you] [uh] physically [you] _agree with_ [me] [you you] wouldn't [do it] _yourself_ . 
A|72| A: [yeah .] yes . [no .] 
B|73| B: nevertheless [you] maintain _that it's_ [it] [is the right] [of] [of] any citizen [to burn the] [symbol] [of] [their] [country] . 
A|74| A: [right] . [yeah .] [uh huh .] 
B|75| B: [uh [,] um] [so] [long as it's] [their] possession . ok , you're you're [that's fine] _up_ [to] [there] except [that uh ,] [what] [that] [flag] symbolizes [is] [uh uh] [is] [this [country] ,] 
A|76| A: [uh huh .] 
B|77| B: [and i] used [to] [know] [as a] boy scout [but] _all_ [i] remember [was] [the] red [in [the] flag] represented [the] blood [that] [was] shed [to] [to] create [this [country] [,] and] [to] maintain [it .] 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [and ,] [to me] [that's [uh] uh] black eye [to] every man [that] _ever_ [uh] carried [a] weapon [or] killed [for] his [country] . 
A|80| A: [i] [agree] [there] [too] . [i] [agree with] [you] [there] [too] . [i i] [the] [um] [i i] [it's] [i] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting [but [i] don't] [think] [that] [i don't] [think] [that uh] [we have] [a] [right] [to] stop somebody from [that] [you know] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [the] same [i don't] [know] [i] guess [i] get [i] get [uh] [all] mixed [up] inside . _when_ , [yeah] 
B|83| B: _it's _it's_ very_ easy [to [do] .] 
A|84| A: [it] _when_ [it's] [uh] [it's] an emotional issue [, and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] [about] [it] logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] [say] [to yourself] [now] emotionally [this] _is a_ disgusting [thing] [, uh] [but] logically [um] [even] [you know] [for] instance , [the] pro life pro choice movement [, [uh] [you] know] [i don't] [know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [, but they] [would] vote pro choice . 
B|85| B: [uh] [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: because [you know] [that's] [just] [a] disgusting [thing you know] somebody an abortion means [it's] [somebody's] [in] trouble [and] [that it's] an awful [thing] [, [you] know] 
B|87| B: [well] [i think] [it] [should be] permitted under certain 
A|88| A: [but] [yeah .] [but] [it] [that's uh] [that's] [what] [i mean] , see [, but] [but] realistically _when_ [you] [think] [of] [it] [it] [just] sounds [like] such an awful [thing] [, and] [it] evokes an emotional response . [i think] [that's] [the] hardest [thing] [, [i] don't] [know] [if] [i] could [ever] [be] [a] judge , because some things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|89| B: [uh-huh .] [huh [.] well] [tell] [me] [has] [it] [ever] been decided [when] [when] [is a] [uh] fetus [a] human ? 
A|90| A: [no] , [no] [i think] [the] [um] sometimes [i] guess [what] [did] [i] read recently [the] [um] [the] [uh] christian [uh] point [is] [is] always [the] point [of] [well] [it's] at conception [but] [then] [um] [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception [is a] biblical term . [and] there's [no] concept [of] conception [in] medicine [or] biology . 
B|91| B: [huh .] 
A|92| A: [so] [then] [that] [so] [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then .] [so] [it's] [i don't] [know] [. [it's] very] [it's it's] [uh [you] know] [it's] [a] [it's] [a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] [really] something [how] [um] political ideas [and] viewpoints _within_ [one] [country] _can vary_ [so] [much] [and] [also] _within_ [um] _within_ [a ,] 
B|93| B: [or] [they] [on] [their] [within] [the] [own] [uh] society [, it] [can vary] . 
A|94| A: [yeah] [and] [how] [yeah] [how] it'll sway from [one] [one] extreme [to] another . 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .]
