A|0| A: _okay_ _how_ _do_ _you_ _feel_ _about_ _them_ ? 
B|1| B: _well i_ keep trying _to get_ _away_ _from_ [them] _i used_ _to use_ _a lot of_ _credit cards _i_ guess_ _for a_ while _i_ _would_ _use_ _you know_ _a_ variety _of the_ visa _and_ _the_ mastercard _and_ _the_ _stores_ _but i think_ _i i_ impulse buy _too_ much _with_ [them] _or_ _i_ buy things _you know i_ _see it_ _on_ sale _and _i_ think_ _oh_ _it's_ _on_ sale _i _have_ _to_ get _it_ _and_ i_ _really_ _don't_ need _it or_ _i_ _really_ haven't budgeted _for it_ _so_ _um_ _the_ last couple _of_ years _i_ _really_ _have_ tried _not_ _to _use_ them_ _at_ _all_ . 
A|2| A: _yeah ._ 
B|3| B: _what_ [about] _you ?_ 
A|4| A: [well] _we_ [have] _this_ philosophy _we_ _use it_ _when_ _we_ _go_ _off_ somewhere [but] _we_ _pay for it_ as soon as _we_ _come_ _back_ [you know] as soon as _we_ [get] _our_ _bills_ _we_ _pay it off ._ 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and we_ only [have] _one_ . _we_ tore _all the_ rest [of] [them] _up_ . 
B|7| B: _okay ._ 
A|8| A: _because_ _i don't_ _like_ [credit cards] [for] _one_ _thing [you know_ i] _mean_ _they're_ [okay] [i guess] _if_ _you're_ _on a_ trip _or something_ _you _don't_ [have_ to] take [a] _whole_ bunch [of] [you know] _cash_ [with] [you] 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ _right ._ 
A|10| A: [but _i] don't_ _like_ using [them] _because_ _i've_ seen [too] _many_ _people_ _that_ [used] _them and_ ended _up_ bankrupt [or] [on] chapter thirteen [and] _stuff_ _like_ _that ._ 
B|11| B: _huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: _because _they_ have_ _this_ weird opinion _that_ _if_ _you use_ _that card_ _you _don't_ [have_ _to] pay for it ._ 
B|13| B: _that's_ true [if] [if] _it's_ [on] _the credit card_ [it] doesn't seem [like] _it's_ _money_ _out of_ _your_ pocket . sometimes [you] _may_ _think _well i_ don't have_ [the] _money_ _so_ [you _use] _the credit_ card_ _it's_ [like] fake _money_ [or _something] ._ 
A|14| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ [and] [it] gives [you] [a] [um] [a] false sense [of] security [or something] [it] seems [like] _because you_ _say_ _oh [well_ i don't [have] _to] pay for _it_ now but_ _you're_ _going _to_ [have_ _to] pay _for it_ and_ [it] seems [like] ... 
B|15| B: [yeah] [you] _think [well i_ don't have] [it now but] payday will _come _and_ then i'll have_ [the] _money_ . 
A|16| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: _but that's_ probably paying [for] things [that] _were_ still owed _from_ last _time_ 
A|18| A: [right .] are [you] married ? 
B|19| B: _yes ._ 
A|20| A: [oh] [okay .] [well i] _know that_ [a lot of] young _people_ [you know i] [it] took _me_ _a long_ [time] [to get it] through _my_ child's head [i] _mean_ [that] _was_ her goal [you know] _uh_ _got _to_ have a_ [credit card] 
B|21| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: [but] [now] [that] she has _one_ she's only [used] [it] _one_ [time] [but] she wanted [to] establish _some_ [credit] 
B|23| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: [but i think] [it] _finally_ sunk _in_ [you know] _because_ she saw _some_ [of the] other _people_ [and] _just like_ she heard [them] _say_ [you know] [well [i] used] [a] [credit _card] _._ and_ _my_ husband's sister _is_ [the] world's worst [at] _oh well i'll just_ [use _the credit] cards_ [and] she has _all of_ her [credit cards] _up to_ [the] limit . 
B|25| B: _huh ._ 
A|26| A: [you know] [and] i'm i'm thinking woman wake _up and_ smell [the] roses before _they_ [come and] [get] [you] . [but] ... 
B|27| B: [right .] besides [the] fact [that] [how] much _interest_ _you pay_ _and then_ [this] ... 
A|28| A: [right] [and] _people_ [don't] [see] [that] either . 
B|29| B: [yeah] _this thing_ _that you_ thought _you got on_ sale _by_ _the time you_ [get] done paying [with] [that] [with] [all the] finance charges [because _you] [pay_ it off] over [a long] period [of] [time] you've spent [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] _money_ [on] [that] [thing] . 
A|30| A: [right .] [the] only _one_ _that we_ _we_ [have] _that we_ kept _was_ [the] discover [card] 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [and] [it] pays [you] [to _use] _it_ _._ i_ _mean_ [if] [you pay] [your] _bill_ [off] [right] [away] [if] _you don't_ ever [have _to] pay_ _any_ [interest] [on] [it] _because they_ give [you] [a] certain _amount_ _every_ [time] [that [you] _use] it_ 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _and you_ make [that] [money] as [long] as _you don't_ ever [have _to] pay_ [them] _any_ _uh_ [interest] . [now] [it's] [and] _people_ _say_ [well] [you know] i'm making [money] [by] using [this] [credit card] [but] _they_ [don't] _realize that_ [if] _they_ [i] _mean_ [it] only takes _one_ [time] [for] [you] [to _use] [it_ _and] not_ [pay] [the] [interest] [i] _mean_ _you [have_ _to] pay_ [the] [interest] [not] _pay it right off_ 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [that's] _going to_ take _up_ [what] [you] [would] [have] made . 
B|37| B: _huh ._ 
A|38| A: [so] [that's] [the] only reason _that we_ kept _that we_ debated [for [a] long] [time] plus _they_ [don't have] [that] [um] _charge_ [on] [it] _you know like_ ... 
B|39| B: service _charge you_ [mean] ? 
A|40| A: _yeah ._ 
B|41| B: yearly fee [yeah .] 
A|42| A: [right .] _they_ [don't have] _one_ [of] _those_ _. so_ [it] _we_ decided [that] _was_ [it] [you know] [and i] [mean] everybody calls us [and] wants [to] give us [a] [credit _card] ._ _we_ [have] _we_ could [have] [credit cards] running down _our_ ears . 
B|43| B: [oh] [you] [get] [that] [stuff] [in] [the] mail [all _the] time_ . 
A|44| A: [yes] [yes _.] [and_ then i'll have] _just like_ _uh_ department [stores] . _they'll_ call _me_ _up you know_ _and i'll_ _say_ _look_ [i don't] _want_ [the credit card] _well we're_ _just_ _going to_ _send_ [it] _to you_ _you know you [don't_ [have] to] ever _use it_ [if] _you don't_ _want_ [to] . _they'll_ _send_ _me_ _any_ [credit card] [i] tear _it up_ _. i_ _just_ _can't_ [see _it] ._ 
B|45| B: [what] [i] _really_ hate [in] [the] mail _is like_ [for] [the credit cards] _that i_ [do] [have] still _that they_ [send] [you] these things [that] [look] [like] checks 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|47| B: _and they_ [say] hey [you know] two thousand dollars [you know] _free_ [to you] _kind of_ [thing you know] [all] _you [got_ to] [do] [is] [go] [cash] [those] things [and] you've [got] [a] short term loan [. i] hate [it] 
A|48| A: [i] _know [it_ _and] you know_ [what] ... 
B|49| B: _i can't_ believe [they have] [the] nerve [to] [do] [that .] 
A|50| A: what's [really] bad [about] [those] though [is] _just like_ young _people_ [if] [they] _don't _you know_ we_ take [the time] _to you know_ help _my_ daughter she's [in] college 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [but] [it] _this is_ her _first_ [credit card] [thing] [well] _when_ she [got] her _first_ _one_ she _was_ [so] excited [it] _was_ unreal . [look] [at] [this] [they] sent _me_ [this] [money] [you know] _. so_ [then] _when i_ explained [to] her [look] _you [have_ _to] pay_ [this] _back [and_ they] are _going to_ [charge you] _interest and_ [stuff] [of] course she tore _it up_ . [but] [a lot of] _parents_ [would] [not] take [the time [you] know] [and they] wouldn't even [think] [of] [it or] their kids [may] [not] be as close as _my_ daughter [and i] are _and uh you know_ [they] [may] [not] even discuss _it they_ [go] _out and_ [cash] their check thinking _that you know_ they've [got] [something] _maybe_ they've won [something _.] you know_ somebody sent [them] [something] [free] . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [and] [go] _out and_ spend _it _._ and_ [um] _it's just_ unreal [. i] [mean] [i don't] [like] [credit cards i] wish [that they] [would] [come] _up_ [with] _some_ other _way_ _to _you know_ the_ only _way you_ could [use them] [is] [if] [you] [were] [like] [on] vacation . [they] [would] let [you _use] it_ _maybe_ once [a] _year_ _. [you know_ i] [mean] [of] course [i guess] _some_ _people go_ _out and_ spend their _whole_ entire limit [on] [it] [like] [that] [at] [that] [time] [but] [um] [i have] seen _so many_ _people_ _and i _have_ a_ friend [right] [now] she _just_ [got] [off] [of] thirteen . she [got] _uh_ [i can't] remember [what] she called [it] [it's] _some_ [kind of] _maybe_ [it's] sure [or something] [like] [that] [it's] [something] [it's] _some_ weird name [of a] [credit card] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and] she [is] charging [out of] her mind already _. and_ i'm _going_ _you just_ [got] _off ._ _that's how_ [you got on] [to] [it] _to start_ [with] [you know] [what] [is] [the] matter [with] [this] person 
B|57| B: [yeah .] 
A|58| A: [but] [um] [it] seems [like] _people_ _just you know_ _they just_ [think well _i] can_ _just have_ _anything_ _i want_ _. and i_ _just_ [don't] [see it] [like] [that .] [of] course [i] _always_ [see] [pay] [the] _bills_ _first_ [and] whatever's leftover [that's] [what] _you have_ [but] [um] _maybe [a_ lot of] _people_ [don't] [see it] [like] [that] [but [i] can't] stand owing [. i] [mean] [i] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe [something] [like] [you know [i] guess] _it's just_ [because] _i've_ _been_ brought _up_ [like] [that .] [but] [um] [i] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that _i] was_ _going _to_ [have_ _to] pay_ [this thing] [out] [for] ever [and] _maybe_ suffer [from] _having_ [to] payout . [but that's] _just_ [the] _way_ [i] _feel_ [about] _it ._ 
B|59| B: [yeah] [i think] [it's] [it's] somewhat [a] [uh] symptom [of] [our] [me] generation [and] [that we] [think] [we] need [all] these things [and [i] think] [my] [parents] [always] [you know] _did_ without [or] saved [up [to] you know] buy things [and we] consider [that] [so many] [of] these things [we] [just [have] [to] have] [you know like] [when i] [first] [got] [my] apartment [and [i] was] setting [it up] [i] _did_ try [to] economize [some] [but] [you know [i] was] [just like] [well [i] [have] [to] have] [it] [all] furnished [and i [have] [to] have] [all of] [my] kitchen setup [and [you] [don't] you know] [do] without [too] much [and you know] [that's how] [i] [got] started [kind of] [with] setting [up] [a] household [all] [up you [know] it] [kind of] [like] [in] [the] short [amount] [of] [time] [. [you know] [you] [just] [have] [to] have] these things [just you know] [have] [them] _at home_ [have [to] have] [them] [at] [my] own place [and] [that's] [you know] [a] big expenditure [to start] [um] buying [all] these things [that you] [think] [or] [or] [have [to] have] [and] actually [they're] [kind of] luxuries [or] [you] should save [up] slowly [and] keep buying [them [and] not] [just] rush [out and] furnish [the] [whole] place [you know] [going] [in] [one] big swoop save [up [and] then] buy [it .] 
A|60| A: [right .] [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [but] [we're] [not] into [that .] [we're] into [like] [have [to] have] [it] [all] [now] . 
A|62| A: [oh] [yeah [.] [i] guess] [it] [is like] [that] though [because] [it] seems [like] _more_ [and] _more_ _people_ are [like] [that .] [but] [um] [i guess] [it's] [because] i'm older [i] [mean] i'm [not] real old [but i] am older [and] [um] [you know i] didn't _feel like_ [that i] didn't _feel _like_ i_ _had_ [to have] everything [. [i] guess] [it] [was] [because] [well i] _had_ everything [when [i] was] [at home] [but [i] [i] don't] [know] why [i] didn't . 
B|63| B: [well we're] geared [to] [that .] [we're] [like] [okay] [like [i] want] [a] living room set [. and] instead [of] sitting [back and] [and] [going] [okay] [well] [it's] [going to] cost [maybe a] thousand dollars two thousand dollars [and i'll] save [for] two years 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [people go] [oh well i'll just] [go] buy [it] put [it] [on] [credit] [and] [they'll] [pay it off .] 
A|66| A: [yeah .] 
B|67| B: [people] aren't tuned [in] [to] [like] saving [for it [and] then] buying [it [they] just] put [it] [on a] [charge] [card] put [it] [on] account [and then] [pay] [off] [the] [bill] [because they] [want] [it now] . 
A|68| A: [huh .] 
B|69| B: [it's] [always] [have [to] have] [it now] . 
A|70| A: [yeah] [well] [it] didn't hurt [you] [did] [it] [to] [i] [mean] [you] didn't [go] [out and] [charge] [a] [whole] bunch [and] lose everything [did] [you ?] 
B|71| B: no no [but [i] have] [had] [some] times [when] [i've] [had] [some] pretty good balances [on] there [and uh [you know] i] [finally] [you know] paid [them] [all] [off] [and] thought [this is] [you know] [kind of] nonsense [. so] [we] [don't] [uh] [have] big balances [on] [them] [at] [all] [now] [we're] [we're] [you know we] [i] [use it] occasionally [but i] [pay it right [off] .] [we're] ... 
A|72| A: [yeah] [well] [you] learned [then] [right] ? 
B|73| B: [yeah] [you] learn [the] [you know the] hard [way you] hate paying [all] [that] [interest and] [i've] never [been] [one] [to] itemize [on] [my] income tax [and] never [had] enough [to] itemize [and] [so] [it's just] [a] big chunk [of] [money] [and you] [realize that] [you're] [not] buying [anything] [on] sale [your] paying [so] much [more] [for] [that] item [because] you've [got] finance [charge] [and] [the] cost [of] [having] [that card] [every] [year] which [is] [what] forty dollars sometimes [just] [to have] [the] [card .] 
A|74| A: [yeah .] 
B|75| B: [that's] [a lot of] [money] [that you] went [to] buy [this] item . 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [and then] [you] never [feel like] you've [got] [anything] [to] [to] put into savings [or] [anything] [you're] [always] [just] paying [bills] paying [bills] [you know you don't] [feel] [that [you] have] [any] extra [to] save [. and i] hate [i] hate living paycheck [to] paycheck [. i] [like] [to have a] little there [you [know] [that] [i] can] save [so] [i can] [feel] [that you know] [if] [something] comes [up] [i've] [got] [the] [money] [to pay for it .]
