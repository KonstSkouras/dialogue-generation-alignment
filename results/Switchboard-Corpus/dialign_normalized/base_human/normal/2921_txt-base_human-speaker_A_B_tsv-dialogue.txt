B|79| B: [well [,] we're] _about a hundred [miles_ [from] pittsburgh] _north ._ 
A|80| A: that's [not] _too_ _bad ._ that's [north .] 
B|81| B: [and] [yeah [,] and _it's _,] it's_ _really_ not_ _, you know _,_ _not_ that far_ . 
A|82| A: [are you] going [up] toward _, uh , uh [,_ i'm] [trying to] [think] [of the] name _of that_ town [that] starts with [an] m , bradford _, no_ that's _too_ [far] [north .]

A|96| A: [yeah _, i] think_ [that] that's _, um [,_ i] _can_ remember [in pittsburgh] [when] , this [has] _to do_ with [homes [,] uh ,] indirectly [but] [i] _can_ remember [when] upper saint clair was [out in the] [, you know [,] the] _rural_ end [of] washington , 
B|97| B: [uh-huh ,] [uh-huh .]
