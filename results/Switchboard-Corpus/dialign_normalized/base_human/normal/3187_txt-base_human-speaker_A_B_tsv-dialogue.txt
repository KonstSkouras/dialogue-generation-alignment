A|0| A: how _would_ _you_ _feel_ _about_ sending _an_ elderly family member _to a nursing home_ ? 
B|1| B: _well , i_ don't [feel] very good [about] _it_ _, but_ _i think_ _that_ _at_ some times _it_ _can_ _be_ _the right_ thing [to] _do_ . _we_ sent _my_ grandfather [to a nursing home] _at _the_ point_ _when_ _he_ _was_ really incapable _of_ caring _for_ himself _anymore ._ 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _he_ actually died [a] few months after _that _,_ and_ _so_ as , _at_ least _in_ retrospect , _it was_ _the right_ thing [to] _do_ _because_ _he_ _was_ either _in a nursing home_ _or a_ _hospital_ _or_ something else _that_ _he_ _would _have_ been_ _spending_ most _of_ his _time_ _in_ those _days_ . 
A|4| A: [right] . [and] _what_ type [of] recommendations did _you_ [have] [when] _you_ decided where [to] place him ? 
B|5| B: _um _,_ well _,_ the_ , see , uh _, _well ,_ we_ , _he_ wanted [to] _get_ into [a] mennonite [nursing home] which _is_ very popular [and] hard [to] _get_ into [and] _had_ like [a] _ten_ year waiting list 
A|6| A: oh , [my] . 
B|7| B: [right] _, we_ wound up _just_ choosing [a] , another mennonite [nursing home] _that_ _was_ easier [to] _get_ into . _or_ _but_ naturally , no , _it was_ _even_ mennonite related , i'm sorry , _it was_ actually _not_ [a] particularly great _nursing home ._ mostly _the_ thing _was_ _that_ _it was_ available [when] _we_ _needed_ _it_ , _because_ _he_ suddenly _got_ sick _and needed_ _to be_ _put_ _in ._ 
A|8| A: _yeah ,_ [so] [the] convenience , [right] . 
B|9| B: uh , [what] _do_ [you] _think_ ? 
A|10| A: [my] grandmother _lived_ _with us_ , [um ,] until august , [um [,] and] [we] made [the] decision [to] [put] her [in _a nursing home] ._ she has leukemia 
B|11| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [and] her [, the] rest [of] her family [and] her regular doctors [and] everybody she trusted [and] knew [was] [in] dayton [, and] _were_ _several_ thousand miles away 
B|13| B: _yeah ._ 
A|14| A: [so] [i] made [the] decision [to] [put] her [in a nursing home] [, and] [my] sister being on [the] other end found one [that] she _could_ [have] [what] [was] called _an_ _independent_ _living_ facility . she [had] her _own_ little room [and] didn't [have] [to] share [it] _with_ anyone [and] _could_ bring [in] her _own_ chair [and] t v set 
B|15| B: [yeah] 
A|16| A: [so] . 
B|17| B: [yeah ,] that's important _i would_ say . 
A|18| A: yes . _and [that_ [,] the] other major factor [is] [that] she needs blood transfusions every week [to] [ten] [days] [, and] [would have] [to be] hospitalized [a] day [or] two , [so] [in] _this_ facility they [can] [do] [it] [right] there from her _own_ room 
B|19| B: okay . 
A|20| A: [so] she didn't [have] [to be] transported back [and] forth . [so] , she's [been] there since august [the] thirteenth [and] seems [to] [have] adjusted pretty [well] . it's [not] her favorite place [to be] [in .] she'd much rather [be] here _with_ me . [but] [when] [it] [got] _to [the_ point] [i] [was] [spending] more [time] [at the] [hospital] _with_ her , 
B|21| B: _yeah ._ 
A|22| A: [and] i've [got] little _children_ here who [needed] me here she [needed] somebody [to] watch her twenty-four hours [a] day . 
B|23| B: [right] [, [and] that] becomes difficult then . 
A|24| A: [so] . she [was] falling down [and] hemorrhaging [and] , [you] know , all kinds [of] physical problems , [so] [it] [just] became _too_ much [for] me [to] handle , _even though_ [i [would] have] liked [to] [have] [had] her stay , _with_ her health being [what] [it was] she couldn't [anymore .] 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] yep _, we_ tried [to] convince [my] grandfather [to] live [with us] [at] [several] points during [the] last few years [of] his life _, but_ _he_ [was] essentially [too] proud [and] [too] [independent] [so] [that] [even though] his heart [was] getting incredibly weak [and] his knees [were] going bad _he_ [lived] [in] his [own] house as long as _he_ [could] 
A|26| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|27| B: [but] _he_ [was] [living] alone , [had] [an] upstairs apartment , [could] barely _make_ [it] up [the] steps [to the] top without [a] great deal [of] pain , 
A|28| A: oh . 
B|29| B: [and] [this] , eventually _things_ [just] went [too] far 
A|30| A: [yeah .] 
B|31| B: [and] _he_ allowed himself [to be] [put] into [a nursing home .] 
A|32| A: yes [, [well ,] [i] think] sometimes [when] people [get] [to be] [a] certain age , other people [have] [to] kind [of] _help_ them [make] decisions . [it] sure wouldn't [have been] granny's decision [to] leave [us] [and] go back [to a nursing home] [, but] she's accepted [it] real [well] now 
B|33| B: [right] 
A|34| A: [so] . 
B|35| B: [well] that's , [yeah ,] that's [right] [that] [the] [children] [have] some responsibility , [too] , [to] their parents [and] such , _to help_ decide what's _the right_ thing . 
A|36| A: [well , we] enjoyed having her here , 
B|37| B: [and] . 
A|38| A: [but] [we] [feel] she's much safer where she [is] now . she still continues [to] fall [, but] [when] she does there , [a] nurse [is] [right] there [to help] her 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [and] [i] know she's eating [the right] [things] [, and] her doctor's [right] there where [he] [can] come [in] [and] check on her , [so] . [it] became dangerous [for] [us] [to] keep transporting her back [and] forth [in] [the] car [because] she [was] [so] wobbly [and needed] [a] walker [or a] wheel chair 
B|41| B: yep . 
A|42| A: [so] [, [i] think] she'll adjust ,
