B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: we _don't_ we _don't_ _do_ enough _. i_ _know_ we _don't_ _so_ _uh_ although lately i've been _uh_ _a_ _friend_ _of_ mine _that_ _i_ spend _a_ lot _of_ time _with_ _does_ _recycle_ quite _a_ bit _and_ _it's_ _it's_ _it's_ _uh_ interesting _to_ watch some _of_ _the_ things _that_ she _does_ _and then_ she's almost had an impact _on_ me _uh_ _where_ she doesn't say anything _to_ me _when_ she comes _to_ my _house_ _but_ _i_ _can_ _kind of_ tell _it_ bothers her _so_ _just_ unconsciously i've i've stopped buying _a_ lot _of_ _uh uh_ paper plates _and_ paper cups _and _i_ don't_ _do_ _that_ anymore _. _i_ don't know_ why _i_ _just_ _don't_ _i_ _just_ _just_ _from_ socializing _with_ her _so_ . 
B|3| B: _how_ [do] _you_ _how_ [uh] _is_ [recycling] done _in_ _your_ community ? _is_ 
A|4| A: _it_ _really_ _it_ _there's_ not _a_ whole lot there _really_ isn't _. uh_ _i_ _know_ [in] my mother's neighborhood [in] san antonio each each _house_ has _they're they're_ given three baskets 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and they_ put _them_ _out_ _on_ _a_ _certain_ day _of_ _the_ week 
B|7| B: right . 
A|8| A: _and_ each [uh] home _does_ participate _but_ we _really_ _don't have_ anything [uh] close [in] _this_ area _that that_ [do] anything . _and_ _and_ some _of_ _the_ communities _that_ [do] _the_ residents _are_ having _to_ pay _to_ participate [in] _it_ . which _really_ doesn't _make_ sense . 
B|9| B: _oh_ . right . over here [they] [uh] [have] several private companies [that] _you_ [can] take [uh] recycled materials [to] _. but_ [uh] _if you_ want [to] take [them] all [to] _one_ place [they] [have] [uh] [the] first saturday [of] every month [they] [have] [certain] _places_ [that] _you_ [can] drop [them] _off_ _. that's_ _what_ [i] [do] [. _uh] [and_ _i] i_ [recycle] aluminum glass [uh] newspapers . 
A|10| A: _yeah_ [that's] good . 
B|11| B: [so] [it's] nice [to] [have] _you know_ _one_ place [that] _you_ [can] take [them] all [to] instead [of] driving [the] glass [to] _one_ place 
A|12| A: _yeah_ _yeah [._ that's] _another_ _thing_ _. you_ [have] [to] _go to_ _different_ [places] [to] [do] [that] . 
B|13| B: right . [so] [it's] _so that's_ nice . [it] would be [it] would be [really] nice _if_ [they] [uh] came _to the_ [house] [to] pick [it] up [and they] [just] were talking _about_ [a] bill [in] tucson _about_ [that] [but] [uh uh] [it] _didn't_ [go] through . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh [.] but] [i] heard [that] most homes [that] [do] participate [in] _that are_ having [to] pay [a] monthly fee [to] [do] [that] . which [uh] _i don't know_ [it] [just] doesn't _make_ sense [to] me . 
B|15| B: right [. i] guess _what_ [they] _what_ [they] were talking _about_ here _was_ [uh] _was_ reducing [the] _garbage collection_ [in] order [to] [make] [that] up _or_ _something_ _you know_ . 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [uh] [so] [i] guess [that's] _one_ option . 
A|18| A: _yeah [._ that's] good [that's] good . 
B|19| B: [i] guess _one_ [thing] [they're] working [on] now _is_ [recycling] plastics too . _like_ [uh] 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [have] [you] noticed [that] [on] [the] bottom [of] plastic goods [they] [have] [this] _little_ number now [that] tells _what_ [kind of] plastic [it] _is_ ? 
A|22| A: huh . no . 
B|23| B: [yeah] [i] guess [the] problem [with] plastic _is_ [there's] [so] many [different] kinds [that] [you] can't [recycle] [you] can't [just] throw all plastic [into] _one_ recycler . 
A|24| A: [oh] [i] [didn't] _know that_ . 
B|25| B: [yeah .] [so] now [they're] _like_ marking [uh] [they're] [i don't know] [there's] six seven eight [different] [kind of] plastics [and they] [they] mark [on] [the] bottom _what_ [kind] [it] _is_ . 
A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: [so] [i] guess [that] makes [it] easy [to] [recycle] [and then] [they're they're] [uh] trying [to] [make] plastic goods [that] [don't have] [a] bunch [of] [different] plastics [in] [them] _you [know_ [that] are] [that are] _only_ made [out] [of] _one_ [kind of] plastic [so] [that that] makes [it] easier [i] guess . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] _well_ [that's] good [. i] i'm [you know] unfortunately garland doesn't [have] doesn't [they] [don't] [i don't know] [they] [don't] [do] anything [like] [that] [or] [i] [you know] [i] read those [little] slips [that] come [in] [to] [your] utility bills [or] [your] [uh] [garbage collection] 
B|29| B: right . 
A|30| A: [and they] haven't [you know] talked [about] doing [something] [like] [that] 
B|31| B: [where] [does] [your] [friend] [go to] [to] [recycle] ? 
A|32| A: she lives [in] garland [and] i'm not sure [where] [what] she [does] [. but] she's [uh] [oh] she's very heavy [in] [that] [and] she takes her own bags [to the] grocery store 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [uh] she has [i i] [really] [don't] think she has any paper products [in] her [house] . 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: [uh and] [just] [a] lot [of] things i've learned [off] [of] her [that] [to] _start_ doing . [and] she [does] [make] [a] lot [of] sense . 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: [just] her whole [house] [is] [like] _wow_ . 
B|39| B: [i] guess [that's] _how_ [it] gets passed _on _._ you know_ [when] _one_ person [you] hear [from] [another] person 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [and then] [uh [and] then] [you] [and then] [you] pass [it] _on ._ 
A|42| A: [yeah .] 
B|43| B: [it] seems [to] be catching [on] [uh] slowly [but] surely [i] guess 
A|44| A: [yeah .] [and] [uh] my [little] boy has watches [a] program [that] [was] [really] _neat_ [. i] sat [and] watched him [. you know] [the] barney ? [you know] [the] [little] [i don't know] [if [you] know] [the] [little] character barney . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [they] had [one] [uh] [on] [that] [kind of] type [of] [thing] [and] [how] children [can] [can] [do] [that] [and] [how] [to] save water _when you_ brush [your] teeth [in] water [and] [it's] [really] caught [on] [and] he's [only] four [and] he's [really] caught [on .] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] [wow] [that's] cute [. that's] [neat] [yeah .] [when you] 
A|48| A: [and] keep [the] refrigerator door closed [and] [that] [kind of] [thing] . he's [really] caught [on] [so that's] [really] [neat] 
B|49| B: [well] [when you] [start] early [i] guess
