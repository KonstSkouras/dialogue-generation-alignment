B|3| B: _how_ [do] _you_ , _how_ [, uh ,] _is_ [recycling] done _in_ _your_ community ? _is_ , 
A|4| A: _it_ _really_ _, it_ _, there's_ not _a_ whole lot , there _really_ isn't _. uh _,_ i_ _know_ [in] my mother's neighborhood [in] san antonio , each , each _house_ has _, _they're ,_ they're_ given three baskets 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _and they_ put _them_ _out_ _on_ _a_ _certain_ day _of_ _the_ week

B|9| B: _oh_ . right . over here _, they_ [, uh ,] [have] several private companies [that] _you_ [can] take [, uh ,] recycled , materials [to] _. but_ [, uh ,] _if you_ want [to] take [them] all [to] _one_ place _, they_ _have [,_ uh [,] the] first saturday [of] every month _, they_ [have] [certain] _places_ [that] _you_ [can] drop [them] _off_ _. that's_ _what_ [i] [do] [. _uh ,] [and_ _i] , i_ [recycle] aluminum , glass [, uh ,] newspapers . 
A|10| A: _yeah _,_ that's_ good . 
B|11| B: [so] [it's] nice [to] _have _,_ you know ,_ _one_ place [that] _you_ [can] take [them] all [to] instead [of] driving [the] glass [to] _one_ place 
A|12| A: _yeah _,_ yeah [._ that's] _another_ _thing_ _. you_ [have] [to] _go to_ _different_ [places] [to] [do] [that] . 
B|13| B: right . [so] [it's ,] _so that's_ nice . [it] would be [, it] would be [really] nice _if_ [they] [, uh ,] came _to the_ [house] [to] pick [it] up [and they] [just] were talking _about_ [a] bill [in] tucson _about_ [that ,] [but] [, uh , uh [,] it] _didn't_ [go] through . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh [.] but] [i] heard [that] most homes [that] [do] participate [in] _that are_ having [to] pay [a] monthly fee [to] [do] [that] . which [, uh _,] i don't know [,_ it] [just] doesn't _make_ sense [to] me . 
B|15| B: right [. i] guess _what_ [they] _, what_ [they] were talking _about_ here _was_ [, uh ,] _was_ reducing [the] _garbage collection_ [in] order [to] [make] [that] up _or_ _something_ _, you know_ . 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [uh ,] [so] [i] guess [that's] _one_ option . 
A|18| A: _yeah [._ that's] good _, that's_ good . 
B|19| B: [i] guess _one_ [thing] [they're] working [on] now _is_ [recycling] plastics too . _like_ [, uh] 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [have] [you] noticed [that] [on] [the] bottom [of] plastic goods _, they_ [have] [this] _little_ number now [that] tells _what_ [kind of] plastic [it] _is_ ? 
A|22| A: huh . no . 
B|23| B: [yeah [,] i] guess [the] problem [with] plastic _is_ [there's] [so] many [different] kinds [that] [you] can't [recycle] _, you_ can't [just] throw all plastic [into] _one_ recycler . 
A|24| A: [oh] [, i] [didn't] [know] [that] . 
B|25| B: [yeah .] [so] now [they're] _like_ marking [, uh [,] they're [,] i don't know [,] there's] six , seven , eight [different] [kind of] plastics [and they] _, they_ mark [on] [the] bottom _what_ [kind] [it] _is_ . 
A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: [so] [i] guess [that] makes [it] easy [to] [recycle] [and then] [they're [, they're] [,] uh ,] trying [to] [make] plastic goods [that] [don't have] [a] bunch [of] [different] plastics [in] [them] _, you know [,_ [that] are] [, [that] are] _only_ made [out] [of] _one_ [kind of] plastic [so] [that] [that] makes [it] easier [i] guess . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] _well _,_ that's_ good [. [i] ,] i'm [, you know ,] unfortunately garland doesn't [have ,] doesn't [, they] [don't] [, i don't know [,] they] [don't] [do] anything [like] [that] [or] [i [,] you know [,] i] read those [little] slips [that] come [in] [to] [your] , utility bills [or] [your] [, uh ,] [garbage collection] 
B|29| B: right . 
A|30| A: [and they] haven't [, you know ,] talked [about] doing [something] [like] [that] 
B|31| B: [where] [does] [your] [friend] [go to] [to] [recycle] ? 
A|32| A: she lives [in] garland [and] i'm not sure [where] [, what] she [does] [. but] she's [, uh ,] [oh] she's very heavy [in] [that] [and] she takes her own bags [to the] grocery store 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [uh ,] she has [, [i] , i] [really] [don't] think she has any paper products [in] her [house] . 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: [uh , and] [just] [a] lot [of] things i've learned [off] [of] her [that ,] [to] _start_ doing . [and] she [does] [make] [a] lot [of] sense . 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: [just] her whole [house] [is] [like] _wow_ . 
B|39| B: [i] guess [that's] _how_ [it] gets passed _on _._ [you know_ ,] [when] _one_ person [, you] hear [from] [another] person 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [and then] [, [uh ,] [and] then] [you] [, [and] then] [you] pass [it] _on ._ 
A|42| A: [yeah .] 
B|43| B: [it] seems [to] be catching [on] [, uh ,] slowly [but] surely [, i] guess 
A|44| A: [yeah .] [and] [, uh ,] my [little] boy has , watches [a] program [that] [was] [really] _neat_ [. i] sat [and] watched him [. you know] [the] barney ? [you know] [the] [little] [, i don't know] [if [you] know] [the] [little] character barney . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [they] had [one] [, uh ,] [on] [that] [kind of] , type [of] [thing] [and] [how] children [can] , [can] [do] [that] [and] [how] [to] save water _when you_ brush [your] teeth [in] water [and] [it's] [really] caught [on] [and] he's [only] four [and] he's [really] caught [on .] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] [wow] [, that's] cute [. that's] [neat] [, yeah .] [when you] , 
A|48| A: [and] keep [the] refrigerator door closed [and] [that] [kind of] [thing] . he's [really] caught [on] [so that's] [really] [neat]
