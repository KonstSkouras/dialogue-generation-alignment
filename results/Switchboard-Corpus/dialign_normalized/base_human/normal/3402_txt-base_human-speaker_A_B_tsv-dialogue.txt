A|0| A: all _right _._ i_ guess tonight's subject _is_ _to_ discuss current _events_ _and_ how _we_ keep up _on_ current _events_ _and_ if we're satisfied _with_ _with_ _the_ _uh_ _coverage_ _that we_ receive . 
B|1| B: [right .] _that's_ [right .] 
A|2| A: _um_ thinking _about it_ some _of_ _the_ ways _i_ _try_ _and_ keep up _on_ current _events_ _is_ _uh_ _i_ enjoy reading _the_ newspaper _but_ _uh_ quite often _don't_ _have_ _time_ _to read_ all _of_ _the_ newspaper _and_ _so_ _uh_ _i_ enjoy _watching_ some _of_ _the_ _t v_ highlights _and_ also _uh_ some _of_ _the news_ periodicals _uh_ weekly magazines _and uh_ _at_ work _i_ also _have_ _uh_ management summary reports _that_ _uh_ give _basically_ _a lot_ _of_ _the_ current _events_ . _uh_ how _about_ yourself ? 
B|3| B: well i'm _like you_ _. i don't_ _i don't_ [i] _like_ [to read] [the] paper [but] [i] [basically] [don't] _do_ [it] every day _and i_ _um i_ usually watch [uh] either _good_ morning america _or_ [the] today show every morning _while_ i'm _you know_ 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: whatever i'm doing [i] watch _that [._ i] usually watch [the news] either [at] _you know_ early evening _or_ [at] ten o'clock 
A|6| A: [right] [right .] 
B|7| B: [so] [i] _get_ [it] _from_ [t v] [a lot] [. i] _get_ [time] _i read_ [time] magazine [um] _that's_ one _i read_ _pretty_ regularly . 
A|8| A: oh yeah . okay . 
B|9| B: _and uh ._ [the] thing [about it] _you know_ now [that] _i've_ _found_ [is] [that we] _get_ such _good_ [coverage] _on t v_ _or_ [at] least such _i don't know_ attempted thoroughness [of] [coverage] by [the] [time] _you get_ [the] [time] magazine _there's_ nothing _in_ [it] _you_ _don't know ._ 
A|10| A: [you] _think_ [that] [that's] [uh] [pretty] adequate [coverage] [and] [you get] . _uh-huh _._ it's_ historic _events_ huh . 
B|11| B: [right .] then _you can_ just sort [of] [have] pictures _to go_ along [with] [it] _or_ _something_ because really _i've_ thought lately _there's_ nothing new _in_ [the] [time] magazine . 
A|12| A: oh okay . 
B|13| B: _you know it's_ [it's] [basically] you've _heard_ everything 
A|14| A: yes . 
B|15| B: [and uh] [you] might [you] might [get] [a] little _more thorough_ [uh] account [of] _something_ [but] really _um _i_ don't know _._ so_ [i] [get] most [of] mine _from_ _television_ 
A|16| A: yeah . 
B|17| B: [i] _would_ say . 
A|18| A: [um i] [found] out _too_ [that] [uh] quite often if [i] _see_ [something] [on] [television] [that] [i] want [more] in-depth [uh] understanding _or or_ [get] want [to] [know] [more] [about it] [that] [the] [the] newspaper _or uh_ [i read] newsweek [can] give [you] [a] better [and] [more thorough] [coverage] [of] what [i've] [heard] [on t v] [but] [uh] [um i] [found] out [that] also _on on t v_ [that] [you can] scan through [a] whole [lot] [of] different _things_ [on] c n n [and] [and] _like you said_ [the] [the news] shows _that are_ _that are_ happening [and] [you can] [read] some [more] [about it] if [you] want [to] . [um i] [found] out though [that] [or] [i] feel [that] [a lot] [of] [the] _stuff_ [on t v] _and the_ newspapers [is] _negative_ . _there's an_ awful [lot] [of] _negative_ _news or_ _bad news or or_ _bad news_ . [and] it'd be refreshing once [in] [a] [while] [to] hear some [good] [news] . 
B|19| B: [right] 
A|20| A: [and uh .] 
B|21| B: _and i_ _i think_ [there's an] attempt [to] _do_ _that ._ _you _know_ _i_ think_ people [there's] [a] mild attempt for [that] [but] _i think_ [basically] [we] [basically] associate [news] [with] [bad news or or] catastrophes [or] problems [or] crises [or uh] _you _know_ ._ 
A|22| A: yes [we] [do] . 
B|23| B: _i think_ our concept [of] [news] isn't necessarily [events] [that] happen [. it's] [more] [negative] [like you said] . 
A|24| A: true true . 
B|25| B: [but] _i think_ people [try] [to] [on on t v] _i think_ _they_ [try] [to] throw [in] [good] [stuff] [but] [it] doesn't [uh] [it] doesn't sway [the] vote . 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ [i've] [heard] [an] interesting comment also [that] [uh] [with] budget cuts [and uh] expenses [the] way [they] _are_ [that] [it's] affected [the news] media whereas before [they] [would] be able [to] [have] [a] in-depth analysis [or uh] investigative reporting [on] certain topics [and] issues [but] [that] takes [time] [that] takes [an] awful [lot] [of] money [and] commitment [and] [and] quite often [it's] [a lot] easier [to] listen [to] [the] police scanners [or] what [they] call ambulance chasing 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and] [go] after [you know it's] [lot] easy [to go] after [and] follow [a] fire department [or] [a] police officer [and uh] find out [news] [from] [that] as opposed [to] going out [and] finding [good] _things_ [so] [. [i don't] [know] i] guess [the] economy [is] [is] effecting also [the news] media 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [and] [we] [have] [to] pay [that] price [but] [uh] [i don't [know] [i] don't know [.] it's] interesting [and [i] think] [that] nowadays [with] communications [the] way [they] _are_ also [that we] [can] _see_ global [events] happening as as [they] occur all over _the world_ [like] [the] 
B|31| B: [right .] [you know] [the] war last winter was certainly [a] [good] example [of] [that] because _we saw_ every single thing practically . 
A|32| A: exactly . [we saw] yes [you know] twenty years ago thirty years ago [we] wouldn't [have] been able [to] [have] [that] privilege [or or] luxury [to] [to] view [that [.] so] . 
B|33| B: [i] mean [you [know] i] remember well just [the] [things] [that are] covered [. i] remember [watching] [the world] series during [the] earthquake [and] just seeing [that] happen 
A|34| A: oh yes . 
B|35| B: [i] mean [you know] [that] was just [so] phenomenal [to] [see] this stadium shake [and the] [and the] announcers [you know] grabbing 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [i] mean [it's] [like] [that] was just [something] because [that] was [like] live [and] real [like you said] 
A|38| A: oh yeah . yeah . 
B|39| B: [and] then [of] course one thing [i think] [too] [is] [with]
