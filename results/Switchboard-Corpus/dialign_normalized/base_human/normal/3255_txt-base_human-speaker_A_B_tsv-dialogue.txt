B|1| B: [probably] _so_ 
A|2| A: _and uh_ whether _or_ _not_ _um_ they'll ever _get_ _into_ _like_ huge transit _systems_ _into_ _big_ cities where _people_ would all travel on _a_ _high_ speed _uh_ train _or_ _or_ something _like_ _that_ _or_ 
B|3| B: _yeah_ it'll _be_ hard _to get_ [people] [to] give _up_ their mobility . 
A|4| A: [yeah] _that's_ exactly _it_ _and_ _that's_ _what_ _we're_ finding _um_ _here_ where _we're_ _at_ _in minneapolis_ area _is_ _that_ _people don't want to_ _carpool_ _that_ _there_ _are_ inconveniences [to] _that_ 
B|5| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _or_ _maybe_ _you_ _don't_ _like_ _the_ person _you _have_ to_ _you_ would _want to_ _carpool_ with _that_ kind _of_ thing [so] _it's_ _it's_ kind _of_ _a_ thing where _uh i think_ _the_ majority _of_ _the people_ _do not_ _carpool_ . 
B|7| B: [i think] [so] too . _i'm_ [in] texas 
A|8| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|9| B: [and] _very_ few [people] [carpool] 
A|10| A: _yeah ._ 
B|11| B: _uh _the_ people that_ [i] _know_ [don't want to] _because_ [uh] _they_ never _know_ [for] _sure_ [what] time _they're_ going [to] leave their job 
A|12| A: exactly . 
B|13| B: _they_ never _know_ _when_ _they want to_ run out [and] [do] an errand [at] noon [you] _know_ _they just_ feel _they_ need their [car] . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh] _or_ _if_ somebody gets sick . [yeah] _or_ _if_ somebody gets sick [and] _it's_ _not_ [the] _other_ person _and [they_ want _to] go_ home [and] [that] one person's got _the car_ then [they're] [they're] stuck 
B|15| B: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _you're_ definitely _right_ 
B|17| B: _that's right_ . [and] [people don't want to] give [it] _up_ _but_ now [i think] we've made great strides [in] changing [a] lot [of] [that] by going [to] [the] unleaded gasoline [and] [and] [to] change [the car] _itself_ 
A|18| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . [sure] [that] happens quite [a] bit 
B|19| B: _but uh you_ _know_ _i _i_ don't_ guess _we can_ [get] away from [it] [a] hundred percent 
A|20| A: yes [yeah] 
B|21| B: _but_ 
A|22| A: [that's] [very] true . [uh] _other_ than [that] _uh [i_ don't] [know] 
B|23| B: well _my_ [other] line [is] ringing 
A|24| A: okay . 
B|25| B: _but_ [we're] going [to] ignore [it] 
A|26| A: _oh_ okay we'll try [to] [be] real quick _here ._ 
B|27| B: _i'm_ sorry [for] these beeps 
A|28| A: [the] [other] thing then [is] [because] [i don't] [know] how long [they want] us [to] talk 
B|29| B: [oh] close _to _five_ minutes_ [i] believe . 
A|30| A: [five minutes] [oh] okay . 
B|31| B: [and] [you're] [in minneapolis] 
A|32| A: [minneapolis] area 
B|33| B: well [is] [the] [pollution] really _bad_ _up_ [there] ? 
A|34| A: [uh] actually no . _we have_ [uh] quite [a] bit [uh the] only problem [that] _we have_ [and] [that's] all over [the] whole world [is] ozone [and] _of course_ hay fever season 
B|35| B: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: [you] [get] some pollutants such _as_ those [but] those _are_ natural 
B|37| B: [yeah] 
A|38| A: _um_ [but] [there] [is] starting [to] [in minneapolis] [itself] [because] [of] [so] _many_ [people] on [the] highway [there] [is] becoming [a] problem [of] [pollution] _and [they_ just] put [in] [a] strict _law_ [that] _as_ [of] _every_ _year_ [when] [you] [get] your license tabs _you _have_ _to_ have_ your [car] inspected [to] see _if_ _it's_ releasing any [uh] lead _into the air_ _or_ [other] pollutants 
B|39| B: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh _._ uh-huh _._ uh-huh ._ 
A|40| A: [and] _if_ _that's the_ case then _you _have_ [to_ get] your [car] _fixed_ 
B|41| B: well [that's the] way [it] has gotten [here .] 
A|42| A: [at] least where [you] . 
B|43| B: [we have] [just] had [that] [law] [i _think] about_ [a] [year] [maybe] [a] [year] [and] [a] half [here] [in] texas 
A|44| A: [sure] [yeah] 
B|45| B: _but [uh_ _i think] _it's_ a_ good _idea_ [because] [a] lot [of] [people] still [want to] drive [the] older _cars_ _which_ [you] can't blame them [for] [that] 
A|46| A: [yeah] [it's] _not_ [a] [bad] [idea] [. uh-huh .] [sure] [sure] 
B|47| B: [and uh] [but] [if] [they] [are] polluting [the air] [they] need [do] need [to have] them [fixed] 
A|48| A: exactly 
B|49| B: [and] [you] [know] there's [a] [big] move especially [in] [the] industrial part [in] texas [right] now [of] controlling [the] c f c [that] [the] [big] manufacturing companies [are] producing [into the air] [they're] having [to] change [the] type [of] products [they] use 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] [. uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [uh] [they] can't use [like] _i have_ [a] friend [that's] [in] [the _air] conditioning_ heating business 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and they] [have to] pay [a] penalty [for] [every] ounce [or] pound [of] _this_ certain type _of freon_ [that] [they] use [in] [the _air] conditioning_ [systems] 
A|54| A: [sure] . 
B|55| B: therefore [the] individual [every] time [they] [have] _a service_ call [if] [they] [have] an old _unit_ [that's] still _using_ _this_ twenty-two _freon_ [or] whatever _it is_ [it] _costs_ them _three_ times [as] much [to get] [it] [fixed] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . 
B|57| B: [and uh] _if [you_ have] [a] new [high] efficiency system [that] uses [the] new type [of] freons [that] [do not] release [as] [many] c f c [into the] atmosphere [it] doesn't cost [as] much [so] eventually [people] [are] going [to [have] [to] go] [to] newer [systems] [you] [know] 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] _yeah ._ [sure] 
B|59| B: [but] 
A|60| A: [uh the] [other] thing [when] [you're] talking [about] [freon] with [cars] [uh] [air conditioning] [i'm] [sure] over [there] [it's a] necessity versus something [up] [here] [we can] live without [it] 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] [right] . 
A|62| A: [but] [it's] uncomfortable 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [but uh] [this] [year] [my] husband recharged our [freon] [because] [it] was needed [to] [be] done [and] one [of] [the] _cans_ released entire amount [of freon] [into _the] uh_ [into the air] [because] he opened [it] 
B|65| B: [um] . 
A|66| A: [and] [i don't] [know] [if] [there] was something wrong with [it] [or] [it] his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto [that] 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [and] [i] was thinking how [many] [other] [people] 
B|69| B: [it's] [probably] happened [to] millions [of] [people] 
A|70| A: [oh] [sure] [because] [if you] take [it] [into] [a service] station [they want to] charge [you] forty dollars [just] [for] [uh] [freon] [which] only [costs] [you] [about] [three] dollars 
B|71| B: [uh-huh [.] uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [so] [i have] [this] feeling [that] [freon] [probably] will increase [in] price [because] [it is] something [that] [people] will [have to] take [into] consideration [and] say hey [that's] [that's right] [there] . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh] 
A|74| A: [i think it's] [like] [three] [or] four dollars [a] [a] [can] 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: [and] [it] takes [about] four [to five] _cans_ [to] fill [up] [a] [air conditioning] [unit] [in] [a] [car] [and] [i i] thought [about] [that] [and] [my] husband even was kind [of] woozy after [that] [because] [i'm] [sure] he breathed [it] 
B|77| B: inhaled [so] much [of] [it] [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [but uh you] [think about] [that] all [the people that] [are] [using] [freon] [and] things [like] [that] 
B|79| B: [yeah] well [of course] [in] [the [uh] i think] [you] [probably] noticed [in] [the] discount stores [and] places [in] [the] hair sprays [we're] [not] seeing [as] [many] aerosol [cans] down [here] nearly everything [is] [in] [the] pump squirt
