B|13| B: [oh] [, yeah .] [well ,] most [of] [my] [camping [,] i] haven't done _much_ [since] [i] [was a] kid [but , uh , we'd] , basically , [take] [the] [tent] _up in the_ sierras [and , uh ,] usually [just] camp near [some] stream _or_ [some] lake . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh .] _sure_ .

B|27| B: [yeah .] 
A|28| A: [i] [, i] [just] don't feel [right] so . there's lots [of] places if you're [going to] [go] [camping] . k o [a] [are] wonderful . [it's] kind [of] [it's] kind [of] [the] [, uh ,] yuppie type [of] [camping] because they [have] showers , they [have] things [for] kids [to] [do] . they [have] swimming pools , things [like] [that] . if [you] can find [, uh ,] [some] really nice , clean [, uh ,] campgrounds versus [, uh ,] if [you go] [to] state parks [, uh ,] 
B|29| B: [oh] , [my] . 
A|30| A: [we] [have] found state parks , [not] [that] they're lacking [but , uh ,] they're [certainly] [not] [up] [to] [a] standard [of a] k o [a] [where] [it's ,] [you] know [, a] little bit cleaner . you've got [the] showers available . [it's] [not] , [you] know [, [in] the] same category . state parks , [you] know , [you] get [a] little bit fearful too [, uh ,] [you] know , things [like] [that] simply because [it ,] they [are] supposed [to be] patrolled [but , uh ,] [you] know , [it's ,] [it's] [a] little bit different [. but ,] so we've always kind [of] stayed with [a] k o [a] [and] [then] [, uh ,] did other things besides [just] sit at [the] campground at night [. that's] [the] only time [you] really use [your] campground . if you're [going to be] gone all day [long] , walking someplace [or] doing tourism [or] whatever [uh ,] you're [camping] really is [just] [for] [like] [in the] evening [to] start [the] fire , [to] sit back [and] watch [a] fire [, uh ,] [to] enjoy [that] , [you] know , [and] [then] [to] get [up in the] morning [and] get [a shower] [and] get cleaned [up] , [that] kind [of] [stuff] .
