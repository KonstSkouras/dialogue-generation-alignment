A|2| A: _oh yeah_ _yeah ._ _we_ did _a lot_ [of] different things . _we'd_ stop when _we_ wanted _to_ _that_ kind [of] _stuff_ . so _we_ kind [of] did [a] little bit [of] [hiking] _sure_ _and a_ little bit [of] _uh_ sightseeing _uh_ different areas . _uh_ sitting back at different areas _and_ spending hours _we_ never had really [a] time limit _we just_ kind [of] did what _we_ wanted _to_ _do_ _for_ _that_ day . 
B|3| B: um . 
A|4| A: very comfortable so . 
B|5| B: [were] [you] _up in_ _in wisconsin_ _or_ would _you go_ into _where_ would [you] camp ?

B|9| B: [oh [yeah] _.] that's_ beautiful . 
A|10| A: _and_ _we just_ _have_ _this_ _uh_ really good time _there_ . one thing is they don't _have_ mosquitoes _and uh_ sorry _to_ say _and uh_ [in wisconsin] _we_ _do_ so _that_ kind [of] puts [a] little bit [of a] hamper on _your_ _uh_ [you] know if if you're _going to_ [go] [camping] who wants _to_ deal with bugs _and uh_ 
B|11| B: _right_ 
A|12| A: _we_ found _this_ one area _that_ doesn't _have_ mosquitoes . they _just_ don't _have_ them _and_ _it's_ _just_ wonderful _not_ _to be_ bugged all night [long] with [a] humming mosquito at _your_ ear 
B|13| B: [oh [yeah] .] [well] most [of] [my] [camping] [i] haven't done _much_ [since] [i] [was a] kid [but uh we'd] basically [take] [the] [tent] _up in the_ sierras [and uh] usually [just] camp near [some] stream _or_ [some] lake . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh .] _sure_ . 
B|15| B: [and uh just] [it] wasn't even [a] [a] full [tent] . [it] would [be] more [a] tarp [uh] strung [up] between trees 
A|16| A: _sure_ . [uh-huh .] _sure_ . 
B|17| B: [and uh] [we just] thought [it was] absolute heaven . 
A|18| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|19| B: [uh] [there was] _certainly_ nothing [like] [a] [a bathroom] _a shower_ _or_ anything near by [it was] dig [your] own hole [and uh] [and i] i'm [not] [sure] i'd [do] [that] [that] _anymore_ 
A|20| A: [that] [was] really called roughing [it] [yeah [.] i] [anymore] . [yeah] see 
B|21| B: [but] [it's] [it] [uh] [uh] actually [some] friends [of] [mine] [and i] [are] planning [to] camp [this] summer [uh] [for] four days . [also] [going] fishing [uh] 
A|22| A: [uh-huh .] [sure] . [uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [and i] [have a] idea [it's] _going to be_ [a] [a lot] more equipment [and [a] lot] more [stuff] _than_ before . 
A|24| A: [than] [you] [sure] . [than] [it] when [you] [were] younger [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: [yeah [.] but] 
A|26| A: [it] with kids they don't care if they [take] [a shower] everyday . with kids they don't care [you] know [uh] [a] about [a lot] [of] things [. but] as adults [uh] [it's] [like] if [i] don't [take] [a shower] every day [i] feel [like] [you] know ooh . 
B|27| B: [yeah .] 
A|28| A: [i] [i] [just] don't feel [right] so . there's lots [of] places if you're [going to] [go] [camping] . k o [a] [are] wonderful . [it's] kind [of] [it's] kind [of] [the] [uh] yuppie type [of] [camping] because they [have] showers they [have] things [for] kids [to] [do] . they [have] swimming pools things [like] [that] . if [you] can find [uh] [some] really nice clean [uh] campgrounds versus [uh] if [you go] [to] state parks [uh] 
B|29| B: [oh] [my] . 
A|30| A: [we] [have] found state parks [not] [that] they're lacking [but uh] they're [certainly] [not] [up] [to] [a] standard [of a] k o [a] [where] [it's] [you] know [a] little bit cleaner . you've got [the] showers available . [it's] [not] [you] know [in the] same category . state parks [you] know [you] get [a] little bit fearful too [uh] [you] know things [like] [that] simply because [it] they [are] supposed [to be] patrolled [but uh] [you] know [it's] [it's] [a] little bit different [. but] so we've always kind [of] stayed with [a] k o [a] [and] [then] [uh] did other things besides [just] sit at [the] campground at night [. that's] [the] only time [you] really use [your] campground . if you're [going to be] gone all day [long] walking someplace [or] doing tourism [or] whatever [uh] you're [camping] really is [just] [for] [like] [in the] evening [to] start [the] fire [to] sit back [and] watch [a] fire [uh] [to] enjoy [that] [you] know [and] [then] [to] get [up in the] morning [and] get [a shower] [and] get cleaned [up] [that] kind [of] [stuff] . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: so [we] never really spent [that] [much] time at [the] campground as [much] as [we] did
