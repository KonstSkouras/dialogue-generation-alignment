A|52| A: [the only] [thing] _i know_ [that] [you can] [recycle] [is] milk jugs . 
B|53| B: [really] ? 
A|54| A: [yeah] . 
B|55| B: _what_ about [like] those _grocery_ _bags_ ? 
A|56| A: [oh yeah] [they] [have] [uh] [uh what] [i] [what] [i] [used to] [uh] _now_ [that] [i don't] [go] _to the_ [grocery] store _much_ it's [kind of] moot [but i] [used to just save] [up] [the] _ones_ [that] [i] got one [time] [and then] [go] [and] hand [them to them] [the] next [time] [and] _use_ [them] over [and] over . 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [but] also most places [like] [big] star does [and] [i'm] not [sure] [if] kroger does [or] not [but] 
B|59| B: they'll ask [you] whether [you] want _bags_ [or] _paper_ [or] plastic .

A|72| A: [well] [it] [is] [it] [is] though . 
B|73| B: [it] [comes] [from] trees . how [can] [it] _be_ _bad_ ? 
A|74| A: [it] [is] _because_ [they] 
B|75| B: _they treat it_ _with chemicals_ [or] [something] ? why [can't] trees break down _? i don't_ get [it .] 
A|76| A: [well] [they do] [treat] [paper] [with chemicals] [like] _yellow_ [paper] [you know] takes [something] [like] twenty times [as] long [to] decompose . 
B|77| B: yep . [oh] 
A|78| A: [you know] [you can] bury [a] piece [of] _yellow_ [paper] [it] will still [be] [there] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks .

A|82| A: [it] will [be] whole . you'll [be] able [to] read off [of] [it .] 
B|83| B: [i'm] going [to] switch [from] those [yellow] legal pads [then] . 
A|84| A: [yeah] [um .] 
B|85| B: [i'm] glad [you] told me [that] [because] [i] [use] those [at] work where [i] work [and uh] [but i] [can] [just] forget [that] [from] [now] on _. i'm_ going [i'm] going [to] switch [to the] _white_ [ones] . 
A|86| A: [well] [white] paper's [bad] [too .] [they [they] treat it] [too .] 
B|87| B: [well] [what] about [uh] papyrus [you know] made out _of you know_ bamboo [stuff] [from] [the] [from] [the] banks [of the] nile . 
A|88| A: [i'm] [sure] [that's] fine [. i'm] [sure] . maybe [we] ought [to just] start carving [in] stone again .

A|90| A: maybe . 
B|91| B: tablets ? 
A|92| A: [yeah] . 
B|93| B: _i think_ [we] should [just] abandon [the] [you know] [the] written word altogether [you [know] .] 
A|94| A: _you think [?_ [i don't] know] [well] [i mean] [i think] we've [kind [of] you know] 
B|95| B: [what] [do] [you think ?] 
A|96| A: [i mean] everybody everybody everybody has [a] computer . 
B|97| B: [kind of] radical [i know] [but]
