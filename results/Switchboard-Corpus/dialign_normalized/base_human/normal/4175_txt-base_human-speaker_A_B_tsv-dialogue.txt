B|67| B: [the] petroleum pretty [much [,] i mean ,] those petroleum products _i think_ [are] [the] [big] [, uh , you know] [the] great satan _of [the_ recycling] . 
A|68| A: did [you know] [that ,] no , [really] not . did [you know] [that [,] like ,] [something] [like] fifty percent [of the] world's landfills [is] [like] [paper] ? filled _with_ [paper] . 
B|69| B: _um ._ [paper] [just] seems [so] innocuous .

A|72| A: [well ,] [it] [is] , [it] [is] , though . 
B|73| B: [it] [comes] [from] trees . how [can] [it] _be_ _bad_ ? 
A|74| A: [it] [is] _, because_ [they ,] 
B|75| B: _they treat it_ _with chemicals_ [or] [something] ? why [can't] trees break down _? i don't_ get [it .] 
A|76| A: [well [,] [they] do] [treat] [paper] [with chemicals] [like] _yellow_ [paper] [, you know] takes [something] [like] twenty times [as] long [to] decompose . 
B|77| B: yep . [oh] 
A|78| A: [you know [,] [you] can] bury [a] piece [of] _yellow_ [paper] , [it] will still [be] [there] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks .

A|80| A: [yeah] 
B|81| B: [huh] . 
A|82| A: [it] will [be] whole . you'll [be] able [to] read off [of] [it .] 
B|83| B: [i'm] going [to] switch [from] those [yellow] legal pads , [then] . 
A|84| A: [yeah ,] [um .] 
B|85| B: [i'm] glad [you] told me [that [,] because] [i] [use] those [at] work , where [i] work [and , uh [,] but i] [can] [just] forget [that] [from] [now] on _. i'm_ going [i'm] going [to] switch [to the] _white_ [ones] . 
A|86| A: [well ,] [white] paper's [bad] [too .] [they , [they] treat it] [, too .] 
B|87| B: [well [,] what] about [, uh ,] papyrus [, you know ,] made out [of] [you know ,] bamboo [stuff] , [from] [the] [from] [the] banks [of the] nile . 
A|88| A: [i'm] [sure] [that's] fine [. i'm] [sure] . maybe [we] ought [to just] start carving [in] stone again . 
B|89| B: _you think_ [so] ? 
A|90| A: maybe . 
B|91| B: tablets ? 
A|92| A: [yeah] . 
B|93| B: _i think_ [we] should [just] abandon [the [,] you know [,] the] written word altogether [, you [know] .] 
A|94| A: _you think [?_ [i don't] know [,] well [,] i mean [,] i think] we've [kind of [,] you know ,] 
B|95| B: [what] [do] [you think ?] 
A|96| A: [i mean ,] everybody , everybody everybody has [a] computer . 
B|97| B: [kind of] radical [, i know] [but ,]
