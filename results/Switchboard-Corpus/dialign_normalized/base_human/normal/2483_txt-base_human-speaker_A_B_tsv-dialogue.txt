A|3| A: _oh ,_ _really_ _, that's_ _great_ _. uh ,_ _my_ daughter talked _to a_ student _. _uh ,_ _in_ general_ most _of_ _them _,_ uh ,_ _people_ doing _this_ _are_ t _i_ _but_ _i guess_ customers too , huh ? 
B|4| B: _and , i_ _think_ [a] [great] number [of] students _who_ _got_ _word_ [of] _it_ _and_ participated [in general] _and_ voiced _who_ _heard_ _about_ _the_ _program_ . 
A|5| A: _yeah_ . t [i] [got] _, uh , a_ lot [of] advances [in] [it] _really_ _. uh ,_ hopefully _this_ will _turn_ _out_ _to be_ [a] _good_ [program] _for us _._ we_ _sure_ need _, uh _,_ the_ business . [okay] , _current events _._ uh _,_ you_ , you've [got] [the] question _you can_ go first _there ,_ since [i] _called_ . 
B|6| B: [i] rely primarily _on [,_ uh _,] newspaper_ combined _with_ television . 
A|7| A: huh _, _that_ ,_ you're [the] opposite [of] me _. i_ _drive_ _an_ hour _each_ _way_ _to work_ [and] _so_ _if_ [i] _just_ _use_ _time _and_ not_ _say_ _one_ , _which_ quality _is the best_ _, i guess_ _, _that_ _would_ be_ _two_ _hours_ roughly [of] talk shows [and] _news_ [on] _radio_ _and then_ _newspapers_ [and] t v _would be_ tied _after_ _that_ _because_ maybe _i'll_ catch _the , the_ evening _news ,_ like _ten_ _o'clock_ [on] t v _and _i_ ,_ 
B|8| B: _uh ._ 
A|9| A: _so_ _that's_ _a half_ _an_ hour roughly _the same_ [with] [newspaper] . 
B|10| B: [okay] .

B|12| B: [that's] rather interesting . 
A|13| A: _yeah [,_ i] _find_ [it] surprising . _because_ [a] lot [of] _times_ _, _it_ ,_ _here _,_ you know ,_ _i'll_ talk _to some_ _people_ _here_ [and] _i'll_ mention someone's _, some_ talk host [and] _i'll_ expect _them_ _to_ _have_ _an_ opinion [on] why [i] _don't_ like him [and] _don't_ _listen_ _, they_ _don't_ _even_ _know _,_ you know ,_ _what_ [the] guys name _is , [uh_ .] bruce williams [who] does financial _work_ all _over_ [the] united states . most _people_ _haven't_ [heard] [of] bruce williams . _you_ _probably_ _haven't either_ _unless_ you're [a] _radio_ buff . 
B|14| B: i'd , i'd [have] [to] [say] [i] [haven't either] . 
A|15| A: he _is_ [in] new jersey [and] _is_ entrepreneur [and] kind _of a_ self-made millionaire _. and ,_ he _has_ _it [,_ _i] ,_ _well_ _it's_ _five_ seventy _here [,_ i'm] trying _to _,_ it's_ [on] cliff [, i] _don't_ _know_ _what_ _the ,_ he's [on] all stations . _you_ _might_ remember [the] name bruce williams _, and_ he , he _is_ again , _national_ [and] talks [about] [a] lot [of] financial _things_ . _but_ _, the_ _here [,_ i] _just_ _get_ [a] kick _out_ _of [,_ uh ,] _well_ _we_ _do a_ lot [of] gardening _here _,_ so_ _there's_ _, we have_ _an_ excellent gardener _here _,_ has_ _three_ _hours_ [on] sunday [and] _three_ _hours_ [on] saturday . [of] course [that's] [not] exactly _current events ._ _but_ [, _i] [,_ i'm] [, i] am kind _of a_ _radio_ buff . 
B|16| B: [i] [listen to] _the radio [,_ uh ,] [probably] [five] [or] _six_ [hours] [a] week [, but] almost inevitably [to a] station _that is_ [a] classical [, uh ,] station [here ,] _for music_ purposes . 
A|17| A: [for music] ? 
B|18| B: [we] [don't] [use] [the radio] _as a_ wake up [, we have] _our_ [, a] television connected [to a] _, uh , uh ,_ electronic alarm [, uh ,] system [that] kicks [in] , 
A|19| A: _yeah_ . 
B|20| B: _and _it_ comes_ [on] [with] _c n n_ _in the_ morning . 
A|21| A: _oh ,_ _yeah_ . [that's] _good_ . actually , 
B|22| B: [that] [we] [, we] wake up [to] television [news] [and _,] uh , uh ,_ shower [and] dress [, and] [whatever] [to] [that [,] [and] then] [because] [of the] _fact_ [that] _my wife and i_ ride [to work] together [, [uh ,] [in] a] [car [,] we] [, we] chat _at_ [each] other rather than , than _something_ else . 
A|23| A: _oh _,_ that's_ _good_ . 
B|24| B: [uh [,] and] occasionally [what] we'll [each] [do] depending [on] whoever [is] _driving_ [is] [have] [the] [newspaper] sort [of] [on] _our_ lap [on the] [way] [in] [, _in] the_ [car [,] so] [we have] [the] advantage [of] being able [to [,] uh ,] _read_ [and] [drive] although [there] seems [to be] , [from] [what] _i've_ seen [on the] freeway recently [that] [a] fair number [of] [people] [are] _reading_ [and] _driving_ 
A|25| A: [my wife] _always_ wonders [about] [that] she _says ,_ look [at] [that] person he's [driving] [and] [reading] [at] _the same_ _time_ 
B|26| B: _so [,_ we] [, we] rely pretty , pretty heavily [, i] _think_ [, on] [a] combination [of [the] [,] [of] the] [two] [. i] also [, uh ,] [use] [, uh ,] newsweek magazine [. uh ,] 
A|27| A: _yeah_ . 
B|28| B: [we] tend [to] alternate between newsweek [and] [time and] [whatever] happens [to be] [the , _the] , uh [,_ news] magazine [of the] year [for us .] 
A|29| A: _right _._ we_ _get_ , 
B|30| B: [and [,] uh [,] i] _read_ sporadically [of] _commentary_ [and] [a] couple [of] other [, you know ,] trade magazines _, and _,_ uh , uh ,_ such _as_ _that , _uh ,_ where_ [i] [might] _read [the ,_ the] occasional social [and] [even] [current] event _commentaries _,_ _and ,_ and_ [everything] _as_ diverse _as a_ _c_ m [to _,] uh , uh [,_ some] [of _the] , uh [,_ some] [of the] other tabloids [i] [get] . _so [,_ uh [,] i guess] [i] [use] [about] eighty percent written , [is] [probably] [my] input [and] twenty percent [, uh ,] television [. [i] , i] _think_ [i] respect [the ,] [from] [a] journalistic perspective [current events .] 
A|31| A: go ahead , 
B|32| B: _i've_ [always] said [that] [it [,] it's] [really] [not] interesting [unless] [it's] [three] weeks old [and] found its [way] _into_ [a] [news] weekly headline . 
A|33| A: _good_ _point_ . [that's] [a] _good_ _point_ . 
B|34| B: [uh ,] other than [that] [it] _was_ [a] [at] [best] . 
A|35| A: _oh ,_ _yeah_ _. [it_ comes] [and] goes . 
B|36| B: [uh ,] we're [probably] [not] thrilled [with] _our_ _only_ [newspaper] [that] [we have] [in] raleigh . [there ,] [there] [are] other _, uh , uh [,_ i'm] [not] [sure] [what] [you] [would] call [them [,] they] [the] small [, uh ,] competing independent sort [of] [newspapers] . little small weekly [things] [, but there's] _only_ [one] daily [, uh ,] [called] _the news_ [and] observer , fondly referred [to] [here] by [some] _as_ _the _, uh ,_ uh ,_ sometimes [the] noise [and] observer . 
A|37| A: _yeah_ . 
B|38| B: [uh [,] it] depends [. [it] [,] it's] [, has] decent [national] coverage [, but] [has] [an] extremely focused political coverage , [probably] steeped [in] [, the] southern history _and the_ _fact_ [that] [this] [is] [a] democratic state . 
A|39| A: _local_ [you] mean ? 
B|40| B: [and [,] uh ,] consequently [everything] [is] filtered _through_ _that , uh ,_ republican democratic sort [of ,] glass , almost unnecessarily 
A|41| A: _yeah_ . 
B|42| B: [so] . 
A|43| A: _yeah_ . [don't] [they] [have] _city_ council meetings [and] all [that] . [are] [you] [into] any _of that_ [what] , _what's_ _going on_ _in the city_ council [and [the] [,] [and] the] school boards [and] all [that] ? [we have] [that] _addition_ [to] [our] _paper_ . 
B|44| B: [yeah [,] we] [, we have] [, _that] _is_ , uh _,_ _as_ a matter_ [of] _fact_ [they] update [it] once [a] week [with] [a] special section [, we] [, and] [we] pay [it] sort [of] glancing nod [. we] [, uh ,] [have] [a] very [good] friend [who] _is , uh ,_ tapped [into] [the city] planning structure [. uh ,] [our] developer architect friend [and ,] 
A|45| A: [okay] [, you] [get] [it] [from] [people] [then] . 
B|46| B: [right .] _so , i_ _think_ [we] [find] [out] [what's] happening [in the city] [, uh [,] on] [a] fairly frequent basis , [over] [a] , [over] [a] gin [and] tonic sort [of] _thing_ . 
A|47| A: [yeah] . [right .] 
B|48| B: [uh [,] and] [that] [probably] gives [us] [a] better insight _as_ [to] [the city] [of] raleigh than , than _the paper_ [would] [have] anyway . 
A|49| A: [my wife and [i] [,] you know [,] as] mentioned [, the] question [was] [, uh ,] [do] [you] [get] [it] [from] [people] too _. _and ,_ [and ,_ i] _can_ [say] _the same_ [thing] [you] [do] [that , uh ,] [my wife] [is , uh ,] she reads [the paper] [from] front [to] back [and] [so] she'll tell me _some stuff_ [and] she'll [always] [get] mad [and] [say] [, you] _didn't_ [read [the ,] uh ,] _well_ [, i] [always] [read the] sports [, uh ,] [what] am [i] thinking [of [,] uh [,] the] [commentaries [,] i] can't [even] [think] [of] [what] [it] [is] offhand [, and] she's [always] [reading] [something] [, and] she _says ,_ why [haven't] [you] [read] [that] _. [and ,_ i] [say] [, i] never [have] [time] [to] [read] [it] like [you] [do] . [but] [, i] [always] [get] [a] lot [of] [my] information _from [the_ [,] newspaper] [through] her . 
B|50| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [uh [,] [so] [, i] guess] [we] [do] [get] [it] [from] [people] too . _oh [,_ you] mentioned [c n n] [, of] course [i] mentioned [radio] [and the] [c n n] t v _news [,_ you know] ? 
B|52| B: uh-huh . 
A|53| A: [it's] _the same_ [thing] [that's] _on [the radio_ ,] [word] [for] [word] . 
B|54| B: [is] [that] [right] ? [i'll] [heard] [there] [was] [some stuff] _on the [,_ [on the] radio] [that] [was] equivalent _to _c n n_ ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah] 
B|56| B: [okay] . 
A|57| A: [and [it] _,] _because_ , _uh [,_ we_ have] [it] [here] [at] [work] [as a matter] _if_ [fact] _, at_ t [i] . 
B|58| B: [okay] . 
A|59| A: [we have] [it] [in the] break area _, [c n n_ _.] and [,_ but] [the] reason [i] [say] [that is] [on the radio] they'll [say] [and] look [at] [this] [, you know] _. and_ when [i] first [heard] [c n n] [, it] [only] started [about] [, uh ,] since _the war [,_ you know _,] or_ [right] _before_ [that] _. and [,_ they] [would] [always] [say] [and] look [at] [this] [, and] [there] _would be_ [a] pause [, you know _,] _would_ be_ [music] [and] [stuff] [and i] realized [that] [it's] [the] exact [commentary] [that] [you] [have] [on [the ,] uh [,] [the] _news] ._ 
B|60| B: [oh [,] that] [didn't] [, uh ,] 
A|61| A: [yeah ,] [yeah] . [but] [, it's] still [good] . [it's] still [, uh , uh [,] you know [,] you] [don't] [really] miss anything . 
B|62| B: uh-huh . 
A|63| A: [but] [, i] [do] , [do] enjoy since [the] gulf _war_ _listening to c n n_ [radio] too [, as] _well_ [as] _watching_ [c n n] [on] t v [here] [at] [work] [. i] [don't] [have] [c n n] [at] home . let me _turn_ [this] [radio] _off_ [, i'm] actually [at] [work] [right] now believe [it] [or] [not [.] [uh ,] where] [was] [i [,] i'm] , go ahead , your , your _turn_ . 
B|64| B: [uh , we] [probably] were [listening to c n n] fairly heavily [before] [the war] broadcasts began [. [uh ,] we] almost live [and , and] breathed [it] [for] [, because] during [the war] itself [to] [the] [point] [where] [we] began [to] sort [of] [have] household pact [of] lets [turn] [the war] [off] [and] [get] [something] done . 
A|65| A: [yeah ,] [i've] , [i've] [heard] [that ,] [yeah] . 
B|66| B: [uh ,] almost [an] [addition] [, uh [,] [and ,] [and ,] and] [we] could equate [or] relate relay [well] [to some] [of the] [newspaper] [and] television articles [about] [the] [fact] [that] [people] [where] having [this] problem [in] [, in] unhooking , uncoupling [from the] [events] [, and] [going on] [with] their . [so ,] 
A|67| A: [right] 
B|68| B: instead [of] being , [watching] [the] missiles [and] being glued [to] [the] tube [or whatever] [. uh [,] and] [because] [of that] [we] began towards [the] middle [and] [of [the] war [,] i guess] [about] [two] [and] [a half] [or] [three] weeks [in] [, we] began [to] restrict [our] [news] almost deliberately [where] [we] [would] [, uh ,] watch [, uh ,] fifteen minutes [before] , fifteen minutes [after] _six_ [our] [time] [which] [would be] [national] [news [,] or] [our] [local] [news [.] we] [would] watch [c n n] until _six_ thirty , [then] [we] [would] watch [, uh , a] rotating network [news] [of] [either] [, uh , a] b [c] [, c] b s [, or] [n] b [c] [and] [we] [, we] sort [of] [just] rotated around [the] dial [each] night [a different] [one] . 
A|69| A: [right .] 
B|70| B: [and then] [we] [would] [turn] [the] television [off] [and] [we] were sort [of] limiting [or] dieting ourselves [on [,] on] [news] [that] [way] [. and ,] [then] [we] [would] [do a] similar [thing] [, uh [,] at] [uh ,] [ten] forty-five [because , uh [,] c n n] [would be] wrapping their hourly coverage up [and then] [we] [would] [get] [the] [local] coverage [, uh [,] [and] then] [i] [think] [the] [local] coverage [we] [would] tend [to] watch [the same] station [that would] [, would] [have] better state coverage rather than [local] coverage [. uh ,] [three] [of the] networks [here [,] on] their [local] [news , uh [,] that] [if] , [if] [you] wish [to] [listen] [at] eleven [o'clock] [you can] [find] [out] [who] raped [who] , murdered [who] [, or] stole [what] .

A|71| A: [oh ,] [yeah] .

A|73| A: [yeah] . 
B|74| B: [unless] [there's] [some] trend [or] [something] [that] [says ,] jesus [this] neighborhood [has] been hit forty-seven [times] [or whatever] [. uh [,] that's] [, that's] sort [of] more [of [,] [of] a] pattern [news .]
