B|2| B: no _i'm_ _not ._ 
A|3| A: _oh_ _really_ _that's_ _great_ _. uh_ _my_ daughter talked _to a_ student _. _uh_ _in_ general_ most _of_ _them_ _uh_ _people_ doing _this_ _are_ t _i_ _but_ _i guess_ customers too huh ? 
B|4| B: _and i_ _think_ [a] [great] number [of] students _who_ _got_ _word_ [of] _it_ _and_ participated [in general] _and_ voiced _who_ _heard_ _about_ _the_ _program_ . 
A|5| A: _yeah_ . t [i] [got] _uh a_ lot [of] advances [in] [it] _really_ _. uh_ hopefully _this_ will _turn_ _out_ _to be_ [a] _good_ [program] _for us _._ we_ _sure_ need _uh_ [the] business . [okay] _current events _._ uh_ _you_ you've [got] [the] question _you can_ go first _there_ since [i] _called_ . 
B|6| B: [i] rely primarily _on_ [uh] _newspaper_ combined _with_ television . 
A|7| A: huh _that_ you're [the] opposite [of] me _. i_ _drive_ _an_ hour _each_ _way_ _to work_ [and] _so_ _if_ [i] _just_ _use_ _time _and_ not_ _say_ _one_ _which_ quality _is the best_ _i guess_ _that _would_ be_ _two_ _hours_ roughly [of] talk shows [and] _news_ [on] _radio_ _and then_ _newspapers_ [and] t v _would be_ tied _after_ _that_ _because_ maybe _i'll_ catch _the the_ evening _news_ like _ten_ _o'clock_ [on] t v [and i] 
B|8| B: _uh ._ 
A|9| A: _so_ _that's_ _a half_ _an_ hour roughly _the same_ [with] [newspaper] . 
B|10| B: [okay] . 
A|11| A: [i] _really_ [of] course _you_ you're _in _a_ different_ part _of the_ country _i i_ _really_ _listen _to_ a_ lot _of the_ talk shows [i] _don't_ mean [the] gossip ones _but there's_ [a] lot _of _on_ the_ weekends when [i] _do_ chores _or whatever_ [i'm] [a] _radio_ hound _i guess i_ take _the radio_ [with] me when [i'm] working [on] _my_ _car_ [the] lawn _or whatever_ [and] _turn_ [on] _they_ _have_ _everything_ _from_ lawn _work_ lawyers _news uh_ veterinarians all kinds [of] items [uh] _so_ [i'm] [i'm] [a] real _radio_ buff especially _on the_ when [i'm] doing chores . 
B|12| B: [that's] rather interesting . 
A|13| A: _yeah_ [i] _find_ [it] surprising . _because_ [a] lot [of] _times_ [it] _here_ _you know_ _i'll_ talk _to some_ _people_ _here_ [and] _i'll_ mention someone's _some_ talk host [and] _i'll_ expect _them_ _to_ _have_ _an_ opinion [on] why [i] _don't_ like him [and] _don't_ _listen_ _they_ _don't_ _even_ _know_ _you know_ _what_ [the] guys name _is [uh_ .] bruce williams [who] does financial _work_ all _over_ [the] united states . most _people_ _haven't_ [heard] [of] bruce williams . _you_ _probably_ _haven't either_ _unless_ you're [a] _radio_ buff . 
B|14| B: i'd i'd [have] [to] _say i_ [haven't either] . 
A|15| A: he _is_ [in] new jersey [and] _is_ entrepreneur [and] kind _of a_ self-made millionaire _. and_ he _has_ [it] [i] _well_ _it's_ _five_ seventy _here_ [i'm] trying [to] _it's_ [on] cliff [i] _don't_ _know_ _what_ [the] he's [on] all stations . _you_ _might_ remember [the] name bruce williams [and] he he _is_ again _national_ [and] talks [about] [a] lot [of] financial _things_ . _but_ [the] _here_ [i] _just_ _get_ [a] kick _out_ [of] [uh] _well_ _we_ _do a_ lot [of] gardening _here_ _so_ _there's_ _we have_ _an_ excellent gardener _here_ _has_ _three_ _hours_ [on] sunday [and] _three_ _hours_ [on] saturday . [of] course [that's] [not] exactly _current events ._ _but_ [i] [i'm] [i] am kind _of a_ _radio_ buff . 
B|16| B: [i] [listen to] [the radio] [uh] [probably] [five] [or] _six_ [hours] [a] week [but] almost inevitably [to a] station _that is_ [a] classical [uh] station [here] _for music_ purposes . 
A|17| A: [for music] ? 
B|18| B: [we] [don't] [use] [the radio] _as a_ wake up [we have] _our_ [a] television connected [to a] _uh uh_ electronic alarm [uh] system [that] kicks [in] 
A|19| A: _yeah_ . 
B|20| B: _and _it_ comes_ [on] [with] _c n n_ _in the_ morning . 
A|21| A: _oh_ _yeah_ . [that's] _good_ . actually 
B|22| B: [that] [we] [we] wake up [to] television [news] [and] _uh uh_ shower [and] dress [and] [whatever] [to] [that] [and then] [because] [of the] _fact_ [that] _my wife and i_ ride [to work] together [uh [in] a] [car] [we] [we] chat _at_ [each] other rather than than _something_ else . 
A|23| A: _oh_ [that's] _good_ . 
B|24| B: [uh] [and] occasionally [what] we'll [each] [do] depending [on] whoever [is] _driving_ [is] [have] _the newspaper_ sort [of on] _our_ lap [on the] [way] [in] _in the_ [car] [so] [we have] [the] advantage [of] being able [to] [uh] _read_ [and] [drive] although [there] seems [to be] [from] [what] _i've_ seen [on the] freeway recently [that] [a] fair number [of] [people] [are] _reading_ [and] _driving_ 
A|25| A: [my wife] _always_ wonders [about] [that] she _says_ look [at] [that] person he's [driving] [and] [reading] [at] _the same_ _time_ 
B|26| B: [so] [we] [we] rely pretty pretty heavily [i] _think_ [on] [a] combination [of the] [of the] [two] [. i] also [uh] [use] [uh] newsweek magazine [. uh] 
A|27| A: _yeah_ . 
B|28| B: [we] tend [to] alternate between newsweek [and] [time and] [whatever] happens [to be] [the _the] uh_ [news] magazine [of the] year [for us .] 
A|29| A: _right _._ we_ _get_ 
B|30| B: [and] [uh] [i] _read_ sporadically [of] _commentary_ [and] [a] couple [of] other [you know] trade magazines [and] _uh uh_ such _as_ _that _uh_ where_ [i] [might] _read [the_ the] occasional social [and] [even] [current] event _commentaries_ _and and_ [everything] _as_ diverse _as a_ _c_ m [to] _uh uh_ [some] [of _the] uh_ [some] [of the] other tabloids [i] [get] . [so] [uh] [i guess i] [use] [about] eighty percent written [is] [probably] [my] input [and] twenty percent [uh] television [. [i] i] _think_ [i] respect [the] [from] [a] journalistic perspective [current events .] 
A|31| A: go ahead 
B|32| B: _i've_ [always] said [that] [it] [it's] [really] [not] interesting [unless] [it's] [three] weeks old [and] found its [way] _into_ [a] [news] weekly headline . 
A|33| A: _good_ _point_ . [that's] [a] _good_ _point_ . 
B|34| B: [uh] other than [that] [it] _was_ [a] [at] [best] . 
A|35| A: _oh_ _yeah_ _. [it_ comes] [and] goes . 
B|36| B: [uh] we're [probably] [not] thrilled [with] _our_ _only_ [newspaper] [that] [we have] [in] raleigh . [there] [there] [are] other _uh uh_ [i'm] [not] [sure] [what] [you] [would] call [them] [they] [the] small [uh] competing independent sort [of] [newspapers] . little small weekly [things] [but there's] _only_ [one] daily [uh] [called] _the news_ [and] observer fondly referred [to] [here] by [some] _as_ _the _uh_ uh_ sometimes [the] noise [and] observer . 
A|37| A: _yeah_ . 
B|38| B: [uh] [it] depends [. it] [it's] [has] decent [national] coverage [but] [has] [an] extremely focused political coverage [probably] steeped _in the_ southern history _and the_ _fact_ [that] [this] [is] [a] democratic state . 
A|39| A: _local_ [you] mean ? 
B|40| B: [and] [uh] consequently [everything] [is] filtered _through_ _that uh_ republican democratic sort [of] glass almost unnecessarily 
A|41| A: _yeah_ . 
B|42| B: [so] . 
A|43| A: _yeah_ . [don't] [they] [have] _city_ council meetings [and] all [that] . [are] [you] [into] any _of that_ [what] _what's_ _going on_ _in the city_ council [and the] [and the] school boards [and] all [that] ? _we have that_ _addition_ [to] [our] _paper_ . 
B|44| B: [yeah] [we] [we have _that] [is_ uh] _as a matter_ [of] _fact_ [they] update [it] once [a] week [with] [a] special section [we] [and] [we] pay [it] sort [of] glancing nod [. we] [uh] [have] [a] very [good] friend [who] [is uh] tapped [into] [the city] planning structure [. uh] [our] developer architect friend [and] 
A|45| A: [okay] [you] [get] [it] [from] [people] [then] . 
B|46| B: [right .] _so i_ _think_ [we] [find] [out] [what's] happening [in the city] [uh] [on] [a] fairly frequent basis [over] [a] [over] [a] gin [and] tonic sort [of] _thing_ . 
A|47| A: [yeah] . [right .] 
B|48| B: [uh] [and] [that] [probably] gives [us] [a] better insight _as_ [to] [the city] [of] raleigh than than _the paper_ [would] [have] anyway . 
A|49| A: [my wife and i] [you know] [as] mentioned [the] question [was] [uh] [do] [you] [get] [it] [from] [people] too _. [and_ [and] i] _can_ [say] _the same_ [thing] [you] [do] [that uh] [my wife] [is uh] she reads [the paper] [from] front [to] back [and] [so] she'll tell me _some stuff_ [and] she'll [always] [get] mad [and] [say] [you] _didn't_ [read [the] uh] _well_ [i] [always] [read the] sports [uh] [what] am [i] thinking [of] [uh] [the] [commentaries] [i] can't [even] [think] [of] [what] [it] [is] offhand [and] she's [always] [reading] [something] [and] she _says_ why [haven't] [you] [read] [that] _. [and_ i] [say i] never [have] [time] [to] [read] [it] like [you] [do] . [but] [i] [always] [get] [a] lot [of] [my] information _from [the_ newspaper] [through] her . 
B|50| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [uh] [so [i] guess] [we] [do] [get] [it] [from] [people] too . _oh_ [you] mentioned [c n n] [of] course [i] mentioned [radio] [and the] [c n n] t v [news] [you know] ? 
B|52| B: uh-huh . 
A|53| A: [it's] _the same_ [thing] [that's] _on the radio_ [word] [for] [word] . 
B|54| B: [is] [that] [right] ? [i'll] [heard] [there] [was] [some stuff] [on the] [on the radio] [that] [was] equivalent _to _c n n_ ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah] 
B|56| B: [okay] . 
A|57| A: [and it] _because _uh_ [we_ have] [it] [here] [at] [work] [as a matter] _if_ [fact] [at] t [i] . 
B|58| B: [okay] . 
A|59| A: [we have] [it] [in the] break area [c n n _.] and_ [but] [the] reason [i] [say] [that is] [on the radio] they'll [say] [and] look [at] [this] [you know] _. and_ when [i] first [heard] [c n n] [it] [only] started [about] [uh] since _the war_ [you know] [or] [right] _before_ [that] _. and_ [they] [would] [always] [say] [and] look [at] [this] [and] [there] _would be_ [a] pause [you know] _would be_ [music] [and] [stuff] [and i] realized [that] [it's] [the] exact [commentary] [that] [you] [have] [on [the] uh] [the _news] ._ 
B|60| B: [oh] [that] [didn't] [uh] 
A|61| A: [yeah] [yeah] . [but] [it's] still [good] . [it's] still [uh uh] [you know] [you] [don't] [really] miss anything . 
B|62| B: uh-huh . 
A|63| A: [but] [i] [do] [do] enjoy since [the] gulf _war_ _listening to c n n_ [radio] too [as] _well_ [as] _watching_ [c n n] [on] t v [here] [at] [work] [. i] [don't] [have] [c n n] [at] home . let me _turn_ [this] [radio] _off_ [i'm] actually [at] [work] [right] now believe [it] [or] [not [.] [uh] where] [was] [i] [i'm] go ahead your your _turn_ . 
B|64| B: [uh we] [probably] were [listening to c n n] fairly heavily [before] [the war] broadcasts began [. [uh] we] almost live [and and] breathed [it] [for] [because] during [the war] itself [to] [the] [point] [where] [we] began [to] sort [of] [have] household pact [of] lets [turn] [the war] [off] [and] [get] [something] done . 
A|65| A: [yeah] [i've] [i've] [heard] [that] [yeah] . 
B|66| B: [uh] almost [an] [addition] [uh] [and [and] and] [we] could equate [or] relate relay [well] [to some] [of [the] newspaper] [and] television articles [about] [the] [fact] [that] [people] [where] having [this] problem [in] [in] unhooking uncoupling [from the] [events] [and] [going on] [with] their . [so] 
A|67| A: [right] 
B|68| B: instead [of] being [watching] [the] missiles [and] being glued [to] [the] tube [or whatever] [. uh] [and] [because] [of that] [we] began towards [the] middle [and] [of [the] war] [i guess] [about] [two] [and] [a half] [or] [three] weeks [in] [we] began [to] restrict [our] [news] almost deliberately [where] [we] [would] [uh] watch [uh] fifteen minutes [before] fifteen minutes [after] _six_ [our] [time] [which] [would be] [national] [news] [or] [our] [local] [news [.] we] [would] watch [c n n] until _six_ thirty [then] [we] [would] watch [uh a] rotating network [news] [of] [either] [uh a] b [c] [c] b s [or] [n] b [c] [and] [we] [we] sort [of] [just] rotated around [the] dial [each] night [a different] [one] . 
A|69| A: [right .] 
B|70| B: [and then] [we] [would] [turn] [the] television [off] [and] [we] were sort [of] limiting [or] dieting ourselves [on] [on] [news] [that] [way] [. [and] then] [we] [would] [do a] similar [thing] [uh] [at] [uh] [ten] forty-five [because uh] [c n n] [would be] wrapping their hourly coverage up [and then] [we] [would] [get] [the] [local] coverage [uh] [and then] [i] [think] [the] [local] coverage [we] [would] tend [to] watch [the same] station [that would] [would] [have] better state coverage rather than [local] coverage [. uh] [three] [of the] networks [here] [on] their [local] [news uh] [that] [if] [if] [you] wish [to] [listen] [at] eleven [o'clock] [you can] [find] [out] [who] raped [who] murdered [who] [or] stole [what] . [from] whom . 
A|71| A: [oh] [yeah] .

A|73| A: [yeah] . 
B|74| B: [unless] [there's] [some] trend [or] [something] [that] [says] jesus [this] neighborhood [has] been hit forty-seven [times] [or whatever] [. uh] [that's] [that's] sort [of] more [of] [of a] pattern [news .]
