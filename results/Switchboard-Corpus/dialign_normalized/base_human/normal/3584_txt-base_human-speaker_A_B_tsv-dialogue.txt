B|87| B: [oh] [i] [see] . 
A|88| A: [so] [the] [first] [you know] [the] [the] [the] [what] [i] [call] residential level at [the] side [that's] _in the_ hill [is] [about] four feet deep .

A|92| A: [so] _i've_ [got] [a] [pretty good] _grade_ there . 
B|93| B: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [and] then [when] [i] put [the] verandas [which] will be twelve feet [out] all [the] way around [on] [the] north south [and] east sides [that] will define [the] shop . 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [that's] kind [of] [like] [like] [a] victorian style ? 
A|96| A: [exactly] . 
B|97| B: [yeah . i] [i've] always liked [that] . [the] [you know i] [we] don't [have] [much] yard [but] [i] built [a] [small] deck [in the] back .
