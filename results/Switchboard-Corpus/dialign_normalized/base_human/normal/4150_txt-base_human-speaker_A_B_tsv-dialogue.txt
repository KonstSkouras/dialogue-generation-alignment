B|43| B: [no .] usually busy fighting [for] survival . 
A|44| A: yeah [that's] [. but] 
B|45| B: [well] [i] [do] think [with] working parents _it_ is [i] mean _there_ are some real issues _here ._ _um_ [that] [i] think _um_ 
A|46| A: uh-huh . 
B|47| B: [i] don't _know_ _. it's_ an interesting _problem_ . [i] happen [to] _um_ i'm [a] pediatrician . 
A|48| A: [oh .] 
B|49| B: [my] husband is [a] physician [so] [uh] [i] [i] [i] [talk] [to] parents [about] this [a lot] [. but] children [i] [i] think working mothers or mothers who choose [to] work outside [the] _home_ _um_ need [very] early [to] come [to] grips [with] any guilt [that] they feel [and] decide what's best [for] them [and] their [family .] 
A|50| A: yeah . uh-huh . 
B|51| B: [and] [i] feel when [my] children were [very] young [i] [had] jobs [that] helped me be flexible [with] [my] schedule [and] spend [time with] them [and] [all] [that] sort [of] thing [. and] [i] long ago decided i'm [a] better mother because [i] work outside [the] _home ._ 
A|52| A: uh-huh . 
B|53| B: [i] _really_ believe [that] [. and] _it_ [has] _um_ helped [us] [to] afford some things [for] [our] children [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [i] think are wonderful particularly at this age [and] [i] think [our] [kids] are real secure [. and] [have a] real sense [of] priorities [and] [that] they [can] [do] anything [and] be anything both male [and] female [a lot] 
A|54| A: uh-huh . 
B|55| B: [so] [i] _know_ _it_ _sounds like_ [a] rationalization [but] _it's_ [i] _really_ think _it's_ true [for] [our family] [and] [i] think _it_ [has] [worked] [very] [well] . 
A|56| A: yeah [. it's] [like] [you] [said] [you know] [to] each his [own] [. and] [we're] planning [on] having [my] _wife_ stay [home [.] and] [but] 
B|57| B: there's [no] question [i] think [that's] _really_ [the] best . if if [a] woman is happy doing [that] 
A|58| A: uh-huh . 
B|59| B: [i] hate [to] put _it_ quite [that] way . 
A|60| A: yeah . 
B|61| B: [i was] twenty-nine when [i] [had] [my] first child [and] [uh] [i] would _not_ [have] [been] real fulfilled . [i] _really_ would _not_ [have] [been] totally staying [home] [with] [a] young child . 
A|62| A: uh-huh . 
B|63| B: [it's] [a] wonderful [it's] wonderful [to] be [a] mother [but] [uh] [i] [like] [i] [like] [the] way [i] did _it ._ 
A|64| A: [right] . 
B|65| B: [i] sort [of] [worked] [half] [time .] [i] [had] [very] flexible hours . [i] nursed [all] [three] [of] [our] children until they were at least [a] year [and] [i] [you] [can] [do] [that] despite working [very] easily [which] is [one] [of the] things [i] preach [all] [the time] [to] [to] mothers . 
A|66| A: [oh .] uh-huh . 
B|67| B: _um_ [and] [i] think [we] choose [very] [very] carefully [the] _um_ alternative situations [that] [we had] them [in] . 
A|68| A: uh-huh . 
B|69| B: some baby-sitting groups again [i] [know] _it_ _sounds like_ [a] rationalization [but] [i] _really_ [do] think sometimes they [very] early [on] are around lots [of] other children [and] they they learn [to] share . they learn _not_ necessarily [to] be [the] center [of] attention [but] [that] at [the] same [time] [we] [have] [to] be sure they are secure . 
A|70| A: uh-huh . 
B|71| B: [i] think [that] helps . 
A|72| A: [well] [that's] good . [sounds like] [you're] [have a] handle [on] [it .] 
B|73| B: [well] [so] [so] [. so] [your] [wife] does [she] work _right now_ ?

A|76| A: [right] . [well] [we] [just] moved down [here [.] we] used [to] live up [in] seattle [for] [a] couple [of] [years] . 
B|77| B: [you're] still [trying] [to] dry out ?
