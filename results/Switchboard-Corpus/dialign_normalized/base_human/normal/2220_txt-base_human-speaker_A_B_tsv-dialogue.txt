B|59| B: [i was] [in the band] [yeah] 
A|60| A: [so] [was] [i] . 
B|61| B: [and i was] [in] [like] chamber [music] groups [and] stuff [so] _i'm_ used [to] [pieces] [and] [and i] played classical flute [i] didn't [play] [play] [jazz] flute or anything [like that] [so] [.

B|81| B: _for_ _east texas_ or something ? 
A|82| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|83| B: [oh] [okay .] 
A|84| A: [just because] [there's] [a] friend up [there] [not] [because] [there's] [much] [else] 
B|85| B: [oh] [okay _.] _well_ they're_ having [a] [lot] [of] recruiting _this_ _week_ [in] [all] [the] different areas . _that's_ why [i [was] just] 
A|86| A: [for] colleges ? 
B|87| B: [yeah] _east texas_ [is] recruiting [for] [you know] their fall semester 
A|88| A: [well [they're] not] 
B|89| B: [and they're] they've _been_ doing [a] [lot] [of that] [in the] area . 
A|90| A: [they're _not] going to_ recruit [me] anymore [i'm] through . _no more_ [for] [me .] 
B|91| B: [no more] [huh] . 
A|92| A: [what] [what] [do [you] do] ? 
B|93| B: [well] [right] [now] [i'm] [just] [a] homemaker [but] [i'm going to] _school_ [uh] [for] legal assistant [and] _that's_ [what] [i] [know] [so] [and uh] [just] nothing basically 
A|94| A: [are you] [going to] _go to east texas_ [for] [that ?] 
B|95| B: [no] [no] [it] [no] [i don't] [go to east texas] [. i] [got a] degree _from_ t w u [but] [i'm] really _interested in_ legal [you know] [in the] legal environment _but [i_ don't] want [to] _be_ _a lawyer_ [so [i] said] [well] [i think] i'll [go] back [to] _school_ [and see] [about] being [a] legal assistant . 
A|96| A: that'd _probably_ [be] _pretty_ interesting [. [i] was] summonsed [down] [to] [the] courthouse last [week] . [they] had summonsed eight hundred [people] [about] four hundred showed up [and] [it] [was] [for] [a] murder trial . 
B|97| B: [oh] [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [this] guy had supposedly [uh] strangled [this] woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling [down] her throat [and] up her nose anyway _this is_ happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|99| B: [yeah .] 
A|100| A: [and] [they] had us fill _out_ [a] long questionnaire . [we] stayed till [about] one thirty [and they're] [going to] call [the] [ones] [that] [they're] [interested in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three _at_ [a] [time] [and] [the] trial won't take place until june . 
B|101| B: [yeah] _that's_ [how] [it] works . 
A|102| A: [and] [they] _say_ [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . _and this_ guy _in front of_ [me] [said] [i can't] _believe_ [i was] summonsed [. [i] was] an investigator [and i was] tailing [the] woman _that was_ killed [. well] [then] [i] [have a] friend _at_ [school] [that] [has] [a] boyfriend [that's] [a lawyer] [and] [he] [said] [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] plano had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the] one [that's] accused [was] [the] one [that] actually did [it .] [and] she [has] since _taken off_ [with] another [lawyer] [who] had [been] [uh] getting cocaine [from] [his] client [and] [then] selling [it and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited _him_ [and] [he's] [going to] testify _for the_ state against her [so] he'll [have] [his] sentence reduced . 
B|103| B: [and [this] is] [the] man [that was] [in front of] [you ?] 
A|104| A: [yeah .] 
B|105| B: [oh] [well] they'll weed [him] [out] . 
A|106| A: [the the] investigator [. yeah] [he] [he] [got] _off_ [right] away . 
B|107| B: [yeah .] 
A|108| A: [and i] wrote [that] [down] on [my] questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that] 
B|109| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [so [i] figure] [that that] [will] _make_ [me] biased [and i] won't [be] chosen . 
B|111| B: [well] [not] necessarily 
A|112| A: hopefully 
B|113| B: [but] [there's] [probably] something [else] [that] might [make] [you] . _because you_ _could_ [know] [about] [you] _could_ [know] [about] [the] crime [but not] necessarily [be] [taken off] [the] jury [you know] [not] [be] accepted [for the] jury . 
A|114| A: [yeah .] [no .] *aa 
B|115| B: [i mean] [pretty] [much] [a] [lot] [of] [people] _would_ [know] [about] [it] [you know] [and] [and] [know] [some of] [the] different [things] [about] [it] [but] [uh] [they] [they] might weed [you] [out] [some] other way [. you know] _if_ [you] _if_ [you] [don't] [believe] [like] _if_ [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and] [and you] [don't] _believe in_ _if_ [you] [don't] _believe in_ death penalty _you're_ [not going to] [be] _picked_ [at] [all] [. so] [but] 
A|116| A: [i said] [that] [i could] [believe in] [it] [in] certain instances [but i] [would] [be] i'd _find it_ hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|117| B: [yeah] [so] [see] [there] [there] [they] [would] [have a] doubt [about] [you] [that] [you know] 
A|118| A: [you know .] [uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [because] _if_ [that's] [what] _if_ [that's] [what] [the] punishment [is] [in] [that] [in] [that] instance [then] _you're_ always [going to] [say] [you know] [not] _you're_ _you're_ [not going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have that] [uh] [that] punishment [. so] 
A|120| A: [yeah [.] [but] then] [when] [you're] [when] [you're] [picked] [see] [i was] [picked] [for] another murder trial before 
B|121| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [oh] gosh [and it's] [so] hard [because [you] know] [everybody] [is] wanting [to] [go] on [and] get [the] sentence done [and] [if] [you're] [trying to] hold [out] [you know] [there's] [so] [much] pressure on [you] [and] [you've] [got] [to] [come] up [with] [a] decision . 
B|123| B: [well] especially [with] something [where] [you] [have to] [you] [have to] [find it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [. you] [have to] [find] whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and it's] [like] [do you] really [feel] [that] sure [about]
