B|39| B: [yeah .]

A|46| A: [i mean] [you can] [just] [sit] [, you know] [those] little booklets [that] _come_ [along] [with] [it] 
B|47| B: [yeah .]

A|50| A: [my] [, my] little boy [has] gotten [so] into [it] [that] _he's_ identified [the , the] [people] [that] [have] written certain [songs _,] then_ _he_ buys [the] [pieces that] _have that_ person _. you know ,_ on _it ._ 
B|51| B: [yeah .] [oh [,] i] [see] _what_ _you're_ saying . 
A|52| A: _huh_ ? 
B|53| B: [yeah .] 
A|54| A: [i mean [, _i] don't] even _know_ who_ did _which ones_ [, but] _he_ does . 
B|55| B: [i _, i] can't_ identify [them] either [. i just _like] [them_ [.] _i] could_ [, i] [know] [which ones] [come] next _, but [i_ don't even know] their names . most [of them] [i don't know] their names [of] [the] song _, but [i_ , i] [can] identify [them _.] _but_ [i_ like that] [and i like] [, uh ,] course [i , [i] like] classical [music .] 
A|56| A: [yeah .] 
B|57| B: [and , uh ,] 
A|58| A: were [you] _in the band_ ?

A|62| A: [yeah .] 
B|63| B: [and i like] [i like] [, uh [,] uh ,] let [me] [think] [who] [, uh [,] you] [don't know] hebert laws [, but] hebert laws [a] flute player , [he's] [a] [jazz] flute player [and i like] [, uh [,] uh ,] chuck mangione [, do you know who] chuck mangione [is ?] 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: _yeah [,_ [i] like] chuck mangione [trying to think] [of] [all] [, uh ,] [oh ,] what's _his_ name , [plays] [the] trumpet _. [yeah_ .] 
A|66| A: [i like the] _moody blues ._ did [you [like] them] ?

[oh [,] but] [we] [do] [have] [, [i] like] _simply red ,_ [we] [got] _simply red_ [. _i] figure_ [all] our c ds [that] _we have_ _what_ [i] really [like] [and , uh [,] [i] like] breeze [, [i] like the] group [. [i] think] _just because_ [they] [all] sort [of] sound , [they] sound [a] [lot] [like] [uh _,] simply red_ . [uh] . 
A|68| A: [so] [what] type [, [simply red] ,] i've never [heard] _of that_ . [is it] [just] _instrumental_ ? 
B|69| B: _no_ , [it's] , [it's] [got] [people] singing [, but] [it's] [it is] [instrumental] _. but_ [it's] , [it's] [got] [people] singing [but] [it's] [got a] , [like] [a whole] bunch [of] [people] singing . 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| B: [you know ,] [how] many [people] [are] [in] [simply red ,] stuart [to] [someone] _else_ [in the] [he] _can't_ hear [me [.] [i] [, i] don't] remember [how] many _people [,_ but] , [it's] , [it's] [got] men [and] women [and it's] [not] , [it's] , [it's] nice [, [i] mean] [it's] pleasant _, you know ,_ [music .] [it's] [not] _where_ [it's] , [it] hurts your ears [to] hear [it _.] but_ [it's] [not] as , [it's] [not] [like] [, uh ,] chicago _where_ [it's] [got] [that] _much_ instrument [to it [.] you know ,] [it] doesn't [have] , [like] [all] [the] brass [and] everything . 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| B: [yeah .]

B|81| B: _for_ _east texas_ or something ? 
A|82| A: [yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
B|83| B: [oh ,] [okay .] 
A|84| A: [just because] [there's] [a] friend up _there _,_ not_ [because] [there's] [much] [else] 
B|85| B: [oh ,] [okay _.] well_ [they're] having [a] [lot] [of] recruiting _this_ _week_ [in] [all] [the] different areas . _that's_ why [i [was] just] 
A|86| A: [for] colleges ? 
B|87| B: [yeah ,] _east texas_ [is] recruiting [for] _, you know ,_ their fall semester 
A|88| A: _well [,_ they're not] 
B|89| B: [and they're ,] they've _been_ doing [a] [lot] [of that] [in the] area . 
A|90| A: [they're _not] going to_ recruit [me] anymore [, i'm] through . _no more_ [for] [me .] 
B|91| B: [no more] , [huh] . 
A|92| A: _what ,_ [what] [do you] [do] ? 
B|93| B: [well [,] right] [now] [i'm] [just] [a] homemaker [, but] [i'm going to] _school_ [, uh ,] [for] legal assistant [and] _that's_ [what] [i] [know [,] so] [, [and] , uh ,] [just] nothing basically 
A|94| A: [are you] [going to] _go to east texas_ [for] [that ?] 
B|95| B: [no] , [no] , _it ,_ [no] [i don't] [go to east texas] [. i] [got a] degree _from_ t w u [, but] [i'm] really _interested in_ legal _, you know ,_ [in the] legal environment _, but [i_ don't] want [to] _be_ _a lawyer_ [so [i] said] [well [,] [i] think] i'll [go] back [to] _school_ [and see] [about] being [a] legal assistant . 
A|96| A: that'd _probably_ [be] _pretty_ interesting [. [i] was] summonsed [down] [to] [the] courthouse last [week] . [they] had summonsed eight hundred [people ,] [about] four hundred showed up [, and] [it] [was] [for] [a] murder trial . 
B|97| B: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [this] guy had supposedly [, uh ,] strangled [this] woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling [down] her throat [and] up her nose anyway , _this is_ happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|99| B: [yeah .] 
A|100| A: [and] [they] had us fill _out_ [a] long questionnaire . [we] stayed till [about] one thirty [and they're] [going to] call [the] [ones] [that] [they're] [interested in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three _at_ [a] [time] [and] [the] trial won't take place until june . 
B|101| B: [yeah ,] _that's_ [how] [it] works . 
A|102| A: [and] [they] _say_ [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . _and this_ guy _in front of_ [me] [said] [, i can't] _believe_ [i was] summonsed [. [i] was] an investigator [and i was] tailing [the] woman _that was_ killed [. [well] _,] then_ [i] [have a] friend _at_ [school] [that] [has] [a] boyfriend [that's] [a lawyer] [and] [he] [said] [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] plano had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the] one [that's] accused [was] [the] one [that] actually did [it .] [and] she [has] since _taken off_ [with] another [lawyer] [who] had [been] [, uh ,] getting cocaine [from] [his] client [and] [then] selling [it [,] and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited _him_ [and] [he's] [going to] testify _for the_ state against her [so] he'll [have] [his] sentence reduced . 
B|103| B: [and [this] is] [the] man [that was] [in front of] [you ?] 
A|104| A: [yeah .] 
B|105| B: [oh ,] [well] they'll , weed [him] [out] . 
A|106| A: [the , the] investigator [. yeah ,] [he] , [he] [got] _off_ [right] away . 
B|107| B: [yeah .] 
A|108| A: [and i] wrote [that] [down] on [my] questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that ,] 
B|109| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [so [i] figure] [that] [that] [will] _make_ [me] biased [and i] won't [be] chosen . 
B|111| B: [well [,] not] necessarily 
A|112| A: hopefully 
B|113| B: [but] [there's] [probably] something [else] [that] might [make] [you] . [because] [you] _could_ [know] [about] [, you] _could_ [know] [about] [the] crime [, [but] not] necessarily [be] [taken off] [the] jury _, you know [,_ not] [be] accepted [for the] jury . 
A|114| A: [yeah .] [no .] *aa 
B|115| B: [i mean ,] [pretty] [much] [a] [lot] [of] [people] _would_ [know] [about] [it _,] you know [,_ [and] [,] and] [know] [some of] [the] different [things] [about] [it] [but] [, uh ,] [they] , [they] might weed [you] [out] [some] other way [. you know ,] _if_ [you] , _if_ [you] [don't] [believe] , [like] _if_ [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and [,] [and] you] [don't] _believe in_ _if_ [you] [don't] _believe in_ death penalty , _you're_ [not going to] [be] _picked_ [at] [all] [. so] [but] , 
A|116| A: [i said] [that [,] [i] could] [believe in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but i] [would] [be ,] i'd _find it_ hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|117| B: [yeah [,] so] _, see_ , [there ,] [there] [they] [would] [have a] doubt [about] [you] , [that _,] you know ,_ 
A|118| A: [you know .] [uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [because] _if_ [that's] [what ,] _if_ [that's] [what] [the] punishment [is] [in] [that ,] [in] [that] instance [, then] _you're_ always [going to] [say] _, you know [,_ not] _you're ,_ _you're_ [not going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have that] [uh ,] [that] punishment [. so] , 
A|120| A: [yeah [.] [but] then] [when] [you're [,] when] [you're] [picked] [, see] [i was] [picked] [for] another murder trial before 
B|121| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [oh ,] gosh [and it's] [so] hard [because] [, you know ,] [everybody] [is] wanting [to] [go] on [and] get [the] sentence done [, and] [if] [you're] [trying to] hold [out] [, you know [,] there's] [so] [much] pressure on [you] [and] [you've] [got] [to] [come] up [with] [a] decision . 
B|123| B: [well ,] especially [with] something [where] [you] [have to] [you] [have to] [find it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [. you] [have to] [find] whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and it's] [like] [, do you] really [feel] [that] sure [about] ,
