A|0| A: _okay_ , _you_ ready _to_ discuss _the , _the_ topic ?_ 
B|1| B: what's [the topic ?] 
A|2| A: _okay_ _, [the_ topic] _is_ _social_ _changes and_ discuss _social_ _changes in_ america _and_ _how_ _they_ relate , _or_ _how_ _they_ differ today than _they were_ ten , fifteen _or_ thirty _years_ ago . 
B|3| B: [okay] . 
A|4| A: _you_ ready _for_ _that_ ? 
B|5| B: [you] bet . 
A|6| A: [okay] 
B|7| B: i'll let [you] lead out . 
A|8| A: pardon _me_ ? 
B|9| B: i'll let [you] lead out . 
A|10| A: [okay] , _well_ , there's , uh , _it's_ _kind of_ an _interesting_ [topic] _and_ _one_ _that _i_ think is_ quite fascinating because , uh , couple _of_ _years_ ago _, i_ guess , uh , _not_ very , _not_ very long ago , seemed _like_ [the] whole world , _not_ _just_ _the united states_ _, but_ [the] whole world _was_ _kind of_ _in_ _a_ standstill where everyone _was_ basically _in_ , uh , [you] _know_ , _a_ very comfortable position , _so_ _to_ say _, even_ _though_ _the , the_ cold war _was_ , _was_ _in_ full swing . [you] _know_ , [you] had _the , the_ russians against [the] americans _, the_ communists against [the] free world , _and_ _in the_ last couple _of_ _years_ _things_ _have_ changed dramatically , _not_ only _on_ _the political_ front _but_ _also_ _on_ _the economic_ front , where , uh , couple _of_ _years_ ago we had , uh , america _was_ _one of the_ leading powers _and_ _one of the_ strongest nations _in the_ world _as_ far _as_ economics _were_ concerned , _and_ _now_ _we're_ having _a_ very tough time _in_ _a_ recessionary period . _we're_ _also_ _have a_ very humongous trade deficit , _and ,_ uh , _and_ _that's_ _kind of_ frightening . _also_ , [you] _know_ , _a_ couple _of_ _years_ ago , ten , fifteen , ten , fifteen _years_ ago , an individual _going_ into _a_ career could expect _to have_ _that_ career basically throughout their whole _life_ , _and_ thirty _years_ ago _, that_ _was_ _, that_ _was_ basically _it_ , whereas _now_ _we're_ expected _to have a_ career _change_ every , [you] _know_ , every couple _of_ _years_ _and_ possibly _four_ _to_ five career _changes_ throughout our lifetime , _and_ _so_ _i think_ , uh , [you] _know_ , _things ,_ there's _been_ an awful _lot of_ _social_ _change_ lately , _and_ _and ,_ uh . 
B|11| B: [i think] [one of the] [things] [that's] [interesting] [to] [me] [is] if [you] look particularly at [the political] [changes] [is] [that] [the _,] they_ _seem to_ be [social] _, they_ _seem to_ be economically driven _also ._ 
A|12| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: [so] if [you] look at russia [and] what's happened _over_ _there_ [, [i] think] [the] [change] [in] communism [was] [as] [a] result [of [the] economic] problems [that] [they were] experiencing . [and ,] [of] course [, i] look at [the economic] problems [in [the] united states] _right now ._ [one of the] [things] [you] wonder [is] what [that's] [going] [to] _do_ [to] _us_ . 
A|14| A: true . 
B|15| B: [i think] [the] other [kind of] [changes] [like] job [changes and] _those_ kinds [of] [things [,] i] mean [, [i] think] [it's] _great_ [to] [even] [have] three [or] [four] different careers [in] your [life] . 
A|16| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: [i think] [it] must [have] [been] terribly boring [to] go through , your [life] doing [just] [one] thing [for] fifty [years] [or] forty [years] . 
A|18| A: yes , yes . 
B|19| B: _some_ [of] [that] _opportunity for_ job [change] [in the] fact _that [,_ that] aspects changing . 
A|20| A: true , true . 
B|21| B: [and] [the] uncertainty [of] whether you're [going] [to have a] job [is] [not] [as] _good [,_ but] [, the] fact [that] [you] _really_ can make major [changes in] your [life] [and] jobs . 
A|22| A: _uh-huh ._ _well_ , [do] , [do] [you] [think] [that's] [good] [or] bad ? 
B|23| B: [i think] [it's] _great ._ 
A|24| A: [you] [think] [that's] [great .] 
B|25| B: oh _, yeah_ . 
A|26| A: [that's] [some] [, yeah] , because _a lot of_ _people_ [seem to] stagnate once [they] get into position [, they] , they're very comfortable [, they] lose [the] ability [to] learn , [and] [they] [in] [a] sense become unteachable . [they] [think] [they] _know_ all [there] [is] [to] _know_ [in the] area , set path , _and you_ _know_ , _come_ [in] [and] put my time [in] from nine [to] five , [and] when [that's] [over] _with ,_ [that's] , [that's] [it] , without [even] _giving_ [a] second thought _to ,_ advancing their _education_ [or] getting extracurricular , um , _education_ , [and ,] [and] [i think] [that's] an excellent [opportunity for] [us] [to] expand ourselves [also .] 
B|27| B: [i think] [one of the] problems [with ,] [with] [education] [as] [it] relates [to] this , [though] , [is] [that i] don't [know] [that] [education] [is] prepared [to] help [people] make _those_ [changes] . [it] [just] seems [a lot [of] the] training [and] [education] [that] goes [on] [is] gearing [people] towards [a] profession [and] [not] [giving] them [the] skills [and] _whatever_ _those_ skills _are_ necessary [to] make _those_ job [changes] , which [i think is] [going] [to] be [a] hard thing [for] _, for_ [people] [to] face . 
A|28| A: _uh-huh ._ [right] _. i_ agree [with] [that [,] i] agree [with] [that] . [but] [i] believe [that ,] uh , an individual should [really] learn _how to , to_ learn 
B|29| B: [yeah] . 
A|30| A: learn _how to_ adapt , learn _how to_ grow [in [the] ,] [in] their college [or] [whatever] [education] [they] might take . _well_ [, [that] ,] [that's] [good ,] [that's] [good] . 
B|31| B: [there] probably needs [to] be [some] training [on] [how to , [to] , to] adjust [to] these [changes] [as] [they] [come] about [. i] mean if [you] look at [the , the] _high_ unemployment rate _right now_ [and you] look at [people] who _are_ [in] _those_ situations [, i] don't [know] [that] [they] [have] [good] coping skills [or] [a lot of] them [, even] ideas [of] [how to] make _those_ [changes] _now ._ 
A|32| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|33| B: [so] [it] seems [to] [me] [that] while _those_ [changes] _are_ taking _place_ , maybe [we're] [not] [well] preparing [people] [to] make [the] [changes] [with] them . 
A|34| A: [yeah] [, i] [, i] read [a] few articles off [in the] newspaper [and] [some] publications where stress , uh [, for] [those] [people] [that] [are] laid off [and] [also] [for] [those] [people] [that] [are] [not] laid off [but] [were] threatened [with] [a] layoff [and] threatened [with] [a] reduction [in] their company [is] extremely [high] [right now .] 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [that] stress [is] [a] very prominent factor [in the] work [place] [and] [it] affects ,
