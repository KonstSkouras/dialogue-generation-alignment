A|2| A: _well_ _i think_ _it's_ _a_ _very_ _very_ complicated 
B|3| B: _huh ._ 
A|4| A: _and i_ sort _of_ [i] _see_ perspectives _on_ _all_ sides . [um] _and i've_ [have] _no_ hope [for] solutions _. but_ _uh_ _i do_ keep myself somewhat abreast _of the_ issue _. i_ [have] _worked with_ _uh_ _uh_ _a little bit_ _with_ refugees _from_ southeast asia _uh_ who've _come _over_ ._ _uh_ _you know_ _to_ escape [the] genocide programs _that are_ _over there_ _. and_ seen _you know_ heard [about] some _of the_ [problems] _that_ they've _had_ _. and_ _i'm_ also fairly sensitive _to_ [the] issues _about how_ open should [the] borders _be_ . _because_ [i] _in_ general _like_ _a_ smaller rather _than_ _a_ larger population _to_ [the] land area . 
B|5| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: [and] _uh_ _i'm in_ california which _has_ _a lot of_ [immigration] . probably _more than_ any _where_ else _in_ [the] _country_ though _i'm_ _not_ sure _if_ _that's_ [the] case . 
B|7| B: [where] [are] [you] ? [see] [well] we've got [a lot] _too _._ [i'm_ in] _texas_ . 
A|8| A: [uh-huh] _yeah ._ 
B|9| B: [in] garland _right_ outside [of] dallas . 
A|10| A: _uh-huh uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: _so_ we're _getting_ [a] large _oh_ gosh _i _don't_ know_ [i think] _there's_ [like] twenty-six _different_ _languages_ _now_ [that are] spoken [in] [i] [the] [i] s d . dallas innercity school district . 
A|12| A: _uh-huh uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: cambodians [uh] _asians_ vietnamese . we we're _getting_ [a lot of] [uh] mexican americans [you know] we've [had] _those_ [for] [a] long time . 
A|14| A: _yeah ._ sure [well] [texas] used _to be_ part [of] mexico _or_ most [of] [it] 
B|15| B: _yes_ _oh_ _yes ._ [to] child [in] [no] [i'm] busy _right now_ steven . steven wants _me_ _to do_ popcorn _right _now_ ._ 
A|16| A: [huh .] 
B|17| B: [to] _okay _._ and _i_ _don't_ know what the_ _solution is_ . 
A|18| A: [i] [i don't] either . _it's_ [a] _really_ delicate [uh] moral issue . _because_ _if_ [you] [have] [well] [i] guess [the] one thing _i do_ [see] [that] [is] [is] [that] needs _to be_ [a] [solution is] [that] _if_ _you do_ let _people_ _into the_ _country_ _i do_ _feel_ [you] _have a_ certain obligation [to] _to get them on their_ feet . 
B|19| B: [to get them on their] [yeah .] 
A|20| A: _because_ otherwise _what you're_ _doing is_ _you're_ letting _people_ [in] [and] _you're_ _you're_ dooming [them] [to] _being_ underclass _people_ . 
B|21| B: _right_ 
A|22| A: [you know] _you're_ dooming [them] [to] ghetto life _or_ whatever [. and i] [know] [that] [that] [the] southeast [asians] [the] hmong _people_ [that] _i've_ done some work _with_ [uh] _feel_ _very_ quite hurt [and] [and] unsure [of] themselves _when_ _here ._ _because they're_ coming _from_ [you know] _from_ [the] slash [and] burn intercultural society [you know] _they're_ coming _from_ [the] middle ages basically [. and] _they're_ _being_ plunked _down_ plunked _down_ _into_ america . _many of_ [them] [had] _been_ promised by [the] c [i] [a] during [the] war _over there_ [that] _because_ _they_ co-operated _with the_ c [i] [a] [and] _they_ _helped_ [the] c [i] [a] out [that] _when_ _they_ came _here_ [the] c [i] [a] _would_ _help_ establish [them] [in] america _and the_ c [i] [a] [of] course _isn't_ _doing_ [that] . 
B|23| B: [um] . 
A|24| A: [and] [uh] [so] _they_ _come_ _here_ [and] _they_ [don't know what the] heck _they're_ _doing_ [. and] _they're_ finding themselves adrift [in] [the] big cities [. and] [of] course _there_ [are] _people_ [in] [the] big cities who _would_ [do] [like] nothing better _than_ [to] take advantage [of] [them] . 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [and] _they're_ _they're_ incredible victims [of] crime [. and] part [of] _it is_ _this_ lack [of] lack [of] basic _information_ _being_ dissimilated [. and] [i'm] _not_ _saying_ _it's_ easy [to do] [and i] [know] _there_ [are] [a] few _people_ who [are] _trying_ _but_ _but_ [the] funding _isn't_ _there_ [for] _very_ _much_ work _to be_ _going_ [on] . 
B|27| B: _and there's [a lot_ of] graft [like] [people] _trying to_ tell [them] _oh_ giving [them] _information that_ _was_ free [to] [them] anyway _if _they_ just_ knew [how] [to get] _it ._ 
A|28| A: [uh] [yeah] exactly . 
B|29| B: [yeah .] 
A|30| A: _i mean_ _these_ [are] [people] who [don't] [have] [the] foggiest idea [about] [what] america's [like] . 
B|31| B: _right_ . 
A|32| A: [um] [and] _it's_ _it's_ [i] [i] couldn't _really_ conceptualize [how] hard [it] [was] [to] understand [that] until [i] until [i] met _with_ [them] [. and i] realized _that they_ some _of the_ [information that] [i] [just] [you know] [don't] even realize [and] [know] [is] [information] [they] [don't] [have] [. and i] never _thought_ [well] [i] guess [that] [is] _something_ [you] _need_ [to] [know] [you know] . [people] [getting] _into_ trouble _because_ [they] _come_ _here_ [and] [so] [they] _start_ _farming_ [on] [uh] available land [you know] . [like] [the] median strips [on] freeways _because_ [no] one's using [it _.] but_ then someone comes along [and] says [you] can't [do] [that] [you know] . why can't [they] ? [they] [have] [no] idea why _not_ some some [of] [them] [you know] . [the] ones [that] _have been_ _here_ longer [and] _have been_ [in] [you know] understand [now _.] but_ _when_ [they] initially _come over_ 
B|33| B: [you] [mean] [really] _trying to_ plant [something] ? [that's] [what you're] [saying] ? 
A|34| A: [yeah] 
B|35| B: [farming] ? 
A|36| A: 'cause _they're_ farmers . _these_ [are] _all_ farmers coming _over_ 
B|37| B: _oh_ . 
A|38| A: [and] _they're_ _being_ put [in] [the] middle _of the_ city 
B|39| B: _oh_ [that's] terrible . 
A|40| A: _i mean_ _they're_ nomadic farmers [you know] _they're_ [people] who farm [on] [the] hillside [and] then leave [the] hillside [to] _another_ hillside [and] farm [on] [that] hillside . 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: _these_ [are] [people] who've never seen flat ground before [and] [people] who've never seen property rights before _. you know_ _these people_ who've never seen any machines other _than_ [those] used [in] war [. and] _uh they_ [have] [you know] . [so] [i] [i] _i do_ _have [a_ lot of] sympathy [for] [them] [and _i] feel_ [that] america could try _a little bit_ harder [to] [to] _help_ [people] adjusting [to] [the] american _way_ . _because_ [if they] [don't] [you're] [just] _going_ [to] produce [you know] [you're] _going_ [to] produce _an_ underclass [you know] . [you're] _going_ [to _get] a_ situation [that] [i think] [a lot] [like] [what] happened [to] [the] blacks _being_ sort [of] led out [of] slavery [and] then then _many of_ [them] ended _up_ [just] working _the same_ _jobs_ [they] _were_ as slaves then [. and] _there_ [was] [no] real _up_ upward movement . 
B|43| B: _and not being_ cared [for] . 
A|44| A: [and not being] [you know] 
B|45| B: [yeah .] [that's] true . 
A|46| A: [um] 
B|47| B: [well] [what] did [you do] [when] [you] [helped] [these people] ? 
A|48| A: [well] 
B|49| B: [how] did [you] [what] did [you do] 
A|50| A: [i] [i] wasn't _helping_ [them] _. i_ _worked with_ [them] [not] [to] _help them_ _but_ [for] _my_ own purposes [. i'm] [i'm] [a] linguist [and [i] _was] uh_ _doing_ [a] _language_ [trying _to] learn_ [their] _language_ _a little bit [._ and i] _actually_ [um] _i mean_ [helped] [them] [them] [in] [the] sense _that they_ received money [for] working _with_ _me _._ _but_ i_ didn't [i] didn't [i] wasn't [a] social worker _or_ anything [like] [that] . 
B|51| B: [all] _right_ . 
A|52| A: _i do_ [have] friends who [have] tried [to do] _more_ social work [you know] by explaining [to] [people] [how] _the language_ [and [what] the] [problems] learning _english_ might _be_ [and] such . 
B|53| B: _uh-huh _uh-huh . uh-huh_ ._ 
A|54| A: _because_ [all] [the] models [of] teaching _english_ [are] based [on] teaching _english_ [to] _spanish_ speakers _or_ [to] other european _language_ speakers [. and] _people don't_ realize [how] [different] some _of the_ [languages] [they] speak [are] . 
B|55| B: [well] [i'm] [an] e s l teacher . 
A|56| A: [oh] [you] [are] ? 
B|57| B: _yes ._ 
A|58| A: [uh-huh] [well] [you] 
B|59| B: [i] got [my] certification [. but] [actually] [they] did [not] teach us [very] [many] things [about how] [really] [to] go [about] _helping people_ [to learn] [another] [language] 
A|60| A: [that's] [that's] _been_ [my] impression . 
B|61| B: [i mean] [it's] [like] [people [don't] know what] [they] say 
A|62| A: [yeah .] [it's] _it's not_ _they're_ [not] withholding [information] 
B|63| B: [it's not] step [for] step . 
A|64| A: [they just] [don't] [have] [that] [information] . 
B|65| B: [yeah] 
A|66| A: _they _they_ haven't_ [the] foggiest idea . 
B|67| B: [but] anyway [i] enjoy [it .] [they they] [the] kids [i've] [worked with] [so] far [have been] [spanish] speaking . 
A|68| A: [yes .] 
B|69| B: [and] 
A|70| A: [and] [spanish] [is] pretty close [to] _english_ [really] . 
B|71| B: [but] [i'm] applying [for] [what] ? _yeah [it_ is] . 
A|72| A: [and] [spanish] [is] [a lot] [like] _english_ . 
B|73| B: [a lot of] our words [are] [the same] 
A|74| A: [yeah .] 
B|75| B: _like [you_ know] [they just] change [the] pronunciation [a little bit .] 
A|76| A: [yeah] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|77| B: [but i] love [it [.] i] love [the] culture [uh] [the] [way] [that they] [uh they] respect _education and_ [their] teachers [their] parents _so _much_ [more_ than] [than] [my] _children_ _do [._ you know] 
A|78| A: [uh-huh uh-huh . [uh-huh] uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [and i] [like] [it [.] [and] what] [i've] [been] thinking [about] [doing is] volunteering _for this_ [uh] _asian_ center _that a_ doctor falk [has] started [that] works [with the] school district . 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [and] [doing] [what] [trying [to] get them] set [up] inculturated [into the] system . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [i] [thought] [that] _would be_ _good experience_ [for] [me .] 
A|84| A: [oh] [i'm] sure [it] [would] . 
B|85| B: [and i've] applied at [another] district [where] [many [of] the] _children_ [are] _asian_ . 
A|86| A: [uh-huh uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [and [i] think] [that] _would be_ _wonderful_ _too ._ 
A|88| A: [yeah it] [would be] _a [good_ experience] [and] you'd [be] [helping people] [i'm] sure . [very] [much] [. and] [and [i] mean] [not] [to] put [not] [to] trivialize [the] [problems] [of] any immigrant group [but _i] do_ _know the_ [asian] groups [are] _having_ [a lot of] trouble [. [i] mean] [and] part [of the] problem [is] [that [a] lot of] chinese [and] japanese [immigration] _from_ [you know] decades ago [has] [been] [very] successful _because_ [they] valued [education and] [so] forth . 
B|89| B: _right_ . 
A|90| A: [they] became [a] [very] successful immigrant group [. but] [and] [but] [a lot of] [people] coming _over from_ vietnam [right now] coming _from_ worn torn countries [are] [are] [not] _having_ [the same] success [. [i] think] some [people] [have] [just] assumed [well] why why can't [you] [be] successful ? [the] japanese _were_ _or_ [the] chinese _were_ _or something . and_ [it's] [really] [much more] complicated . 
B|91| B: [well] _the times_ [were] [different] _too ._ 
A|92| A: [yeah] [the times] [are] [different] [yeah .] 
B|93| B: [my] neighbor let's [see] [is] jewish [. and] he's [going] through [the] [i [don't] [know] the] jewish league [or something . and] [helping] [a] family [that's] [come [over] from] russia . 
A|94| A: [uh-huh . [uh-huh] uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [and] he spends [well] [right now] he's [down] [to] [like] once [a] week [but] he [was] [going] [over there] several [times] [a] week [to be] [with the] family [and] [help them] [with [the] language] . 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [and] he thoroughly enjoyed [it .] 
A|98| A: [oh] [yeah [.] i] [i think] [it's] [a] [wonderful] thing [to [do] [.] [and] there's a lot] [there's a lot] [more] [i] guess [another] possible [solution is] since taxpayers aren't [going] [to] _start_ paying [more] money [for this] [and] [and] other budgets aren't [going] [to be] cut [to] pay [for] [it] [uh] [more] [of the] volunteer network service . 
B|99| B: [no] . 
A|100| A: _because_ everyone gains [from] [it .] 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [would be] [would] might [be] [really] useful . [uh] [and] [if] [it's] [you know] [uh] [just] [people] [helping people] [i think] makes makes [the] community [so much] happier . 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] what's [so] sad [about] [this] [is] both [of the] [the] man [and the] woman [had] [a] degree [having] [to do] [with] computers [but] [their] training [isn't] [what] we [need] _in this country ._ 
A|104| A: [uh-huh _.] [yes_ .] 
B|105| B: [and] [because they're] [so] deficient [in] [english] [they haven't] [been] able [to get] [jobs] . 
A|106| A: [uh-huh uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [so] they'll [have] [to] go back [and] [get a] degree [here [.] you know] almost [start] [all] [over .] 
A|108| A: [yes] [yes] [i've] known [people] [with] effectively worthless degrees [in this country [.] [i] mean] [and] [they're] highly educated [people] [but] [of] course [if] [you're] educated [and] [you] [don't] speak [english] [no] one thinks anything [of] _you ._ 
B|109| B: [no] [no] [. and] [this] woman [was uh] stocking [the] shelves [in] [a] drugstore . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [i feel] sorry [for] her . 
A|112| A: [yeah] _i do_ [too .] [well] [it's] [been] [good] talking [with] _you ._ 
B|113| B: [well] thank [you .] 
A|114| A: [uh] [okay .] 
B|115| B: [have [a] good] night . 
A|116| A: [okay] [it] does sound [like you] [have] some [children] [to] take care [of] 
B|117| B: [okay [.] yes] [i do] 
A|118| A: [uh] [okay] bye-bye .
