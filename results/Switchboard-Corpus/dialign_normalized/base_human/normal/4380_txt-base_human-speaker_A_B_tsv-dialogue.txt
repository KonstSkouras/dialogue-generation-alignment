B|7| B: [okay] [uh ,] i've , [the] [high school] [i went to was , uh ,] [was _a] good_ one also _. and _i_ ,_ _well _,_ i guess_ [you] _could_ say one _of [the_ problems with] [the] [public education] [system] _is_ _the disparity_ between different schools .

A|8| A: [yeah _.] yeah ._ [was [a] , [a] ,] it's _more_ or less [a] suburban [school] [system] ? 
B|9| B: [yeah .] 
A|10| A: yes . _that , that_ [was] _true_ _for_ mine too . [uh ,] although [i] [i'm sure] [to] _some_ extent _, that_ _money_ [is] part [of _the] problem_ _in [the_ disparity] , _but i_ don't _think_ [, i] honestly don't _think_ _that's_ [the] biggest part [of] _it_ . _you know , _i_ think_ _that , uh _,_ i mean_ [i] [know] [that] [in] [my] town [, you know ,] most [of _the] ,_ most [of the] parents , _they're_ valued _education ._ 
B|11| B: _what_ 
A|12| A: _and [,_ uh] [you know ,] [and] _so_ [the] students were [, you know _,] to_ _some_ extent , motivated _to learn_ . 
B|13| B: _yeah , that's true ._ 
A|14| A: _i mean_ [know] 
B|15| B: _yeah . and_ [i'm] also _i mean [,_ _in] the [,_ in] those places where [, uh ,] [like] [the] economy [is] [really] bad _, they_ might [, you know ,] _be_ [more] tempted _to [,_ to] quit _school and_ _get_ jobs _and that_ kind [of] _thing_ [because] _they_ need _the , you know ,_ [money] [to] put food on [the] table [and] stuff [like] [that] . _more than_ _they_ _would_ [you know [,] in] areas where _they_ 
A|16| A: [yeah , that's true _.] but_ _but , uh [,_ _i] think_ _, i mean_ even [more than] _that ,_ even _, i mean_ _if you_ drop out [in] [high school] [you] should _still_ [be] able _to read_ [you know] ? which _it_ [i mean] _it_ sounds _like [,_ uh ,] 
B|17| B: uh-huh [. yeah .] [that's true .] 
A|18| A: [now] _i think_ maybe it's _started_ changing [in the] past few years [because] [, uh [,] they] _have_ [of] these [, uh ,] sort [of] mandatory tests _if you_ _have_ [to] take before [you] [get] [a] diploma . 
B|19| B: right . 
A|20| A: _but , uh ,_ _but , uh ,_ certainly before _that _,_ there_ were _people that , you know ,_ [would] graduate from [high [school] and] [could] barely _read_ . [uh ,] [and] [that's] just sort [of] inexcusable [and] [you] _can't _really_ _,_ _i , i _,_ i_ mean_ [i] just _can't_ even picture how _that could_ happen . [you know ,] except maybe [to] someone whose [, you know ,] [really] badly _learning_ [, uh ,] disabled or something . 
B|21| B: [yeah .] 
A|22| A: _but_ these _people_ obviously weren't . 
B|23| B: [that's] hard [for] me [to] say since [i] didn't [, i] didn't [really] grow , _well_ when [i went to] _elementary_ _school it_ _, it_ wasn't [in] [a] great area [but i] [still] _, i mean , i_ learned [to read] , [started] [learning] [to read] when _i was in_ kindergarten [, you know] . 
A|24| A: [yeah .] 
B|25| B: [so] _i guess_ [i can't really] [i can't] say _what_ [it] [would] [be] [like] _to [,_ uh ,] grow up [in] [a] [really] oppressed region 
A|26| A: [yeah [.] yeah .] 
B|27| B: [you know _, i] guess_ [the] whole , [the] whole environment [and] attitude towards [school and] [learning] [is] different [for] [the] [people] . 
A|28| A: [yeah [. and] _i] think_ [that's] almost [a] bigger factor , [than] anything else probably _. [i mean_ , i] don't [, _i] think_ [you know ,] [people] just , 
B|29| B: [so] _, i guess_ [the problem] [is] [the ,] [the] _thing_ [to] _do_ [is] [to] try _to [,_ uh [,] _to] get_ [some] kind [of] motivation [to learn] [and ,] 
A|30| A: [yeah . [and] ,] again [, i] don't [, i mean] _got_ [know] [the , you know ,] how qualified [, i mean , _i] think_ it'd [be] interesting [to [,] you know [,] to] spend [a] couple [of] days just looking [around] an [inner city] [school] . [uh [,] you know ,] sort , sort [of] maybe from [elementary] through [, uh ,] [high school] . [you know ,] just sort [of] [to get] [a] [feel] [for] [what] it's [like] . 
B|31| B: uh-huh [. yeah .] uh-huh . 
A|32| A: _i think_ that'd [be] an interesting experience _. but , uh [,_ i] haven't done [that] 
B|33| B: _no [, i_ [, i] can't] say [that] [i] [have] either [. but , uh ,] 
A|34| A: [but i] [do] [, i] [do] _think_ _that , uh [,_ i mean ,] [public education] [in] general _i think_ can work [. and _i] think_ it's [a good] [thing] . 
B|35| B: [yeah .] i've , i've heard [some] [, i mean] i've heard statistics [and] things [that , that] compare [a [public] education] [to] [a] private [education [.] i mean] within [like ,] within [the] same [, uh ,] income groups . 
A|36| A: [yeah .] 
B|37| B: [if you] compare [the ,] [like] [the] [people [that] _could] have [,_ [that] _could] have_ sent their kids [to] private schools [and] [the] [people that , you know ,] [the] [people [that ,] uh ,] _did_ send their kids [to] private schools . 
A|38| A: yes . 
B|39| B: [i think] [they] compare [you know ,] fairly _well ._ 
A|40| A: [yeah [.] [yeah [.] [i] mean] , i] don't [, i] honestly don't [really] [think] [i] [could have [,] you know ,] done much better [than] [i] [did] [in the] [school] [system] [i was in] . [mean] 
B|41| B: [yeah . [i] [, i , i] ,] [my] schools [, i mean [,] [there] [,] i] [have] [a] lot [of] _once_ _, once_ [it] seemed [i got] _into_ _high school [,_ they] had [a] lot _of , uh ,_ accelerated programs [and] _all_ kinds [of] stuff [like] [that] . 
A|42| A: [yeah .] 
B|43| B: [that [,] i mean _,] that makes_ [a] big difference cause [i] wondered when [they're] taking classes [with , uh ,] [with] [people that] are [really ,] are interested _in the ,_ [the] subject [and] stuff [like] [that] . 
A|44| A: [yeah [. [i] mean] ,] [and] [and] [in the [,] once] [you] [junior] [high] [, uh ,] start [junior] [high] , starting [in] eighth grade [all] [the] way through [high school [,] there] were four levels . [well ,] [no [, i] guess] [it] [in] [junior] [high] [, it] [was] [still] three . then [in] [high [school] it] changed [into] four levels [of , uh ,] [of] instruction [in the] major subjects . [uh ,] which , 
B|45| B: uh-huh .
