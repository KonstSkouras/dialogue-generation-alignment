B|3| B: _i know_ _they're_ [doing] _some_ _curbside recycling_ as _a_ _kind of_ _a_ test _there ._ 
A|4| A: _yeah ._ _you know [,_ i] read _, you know , when_ _they_ first _started_ [doing] [that] [in] [the] paper _, and i_ read _about_ [that] [, i] _was_ _just_ praying [that] _, that_ _would_ _be_ [in] _our_ [area] _, because_ we've been [recycling] _for_ quite [some] time _. _and_ _,_ you know , we_ separate everything _out_ _, and_ then [have] _to_ haul _it_ _up_ _to_ [a] metco _, you know ,_ which _is a_ real pain .

B|9| B: [yeah .] 
A|10| A: _oh_ , god . 
B|11| B: [because] [i] finally asked [because] [, you know , we] _had_ _all of_ those _milk cartons _and_ there was_ nowhere _else_ _to take_ [them] _and they had_ [it] [in] front [of] [wal-mart] [and i] ask _in wal-mart_ _and they_ said [they moved] [it] [just] [behind] . 
A|12| A: _oh _._ that's_ really _nice to_ [know [,] because _we] _were_ doing_ [the] same _thing ._ [because] _to take _it_ to_ [a] metco [, you] [have] _to take it_ _when_ [they're] open [, you know ,] which [is] always [a] real pain . 
B|13| B: [huh-uh .] 
A|14| A: _and so_ _when_ [that] _thing_ came _up_ [in wal-mart] parking lot [, we] thought , _oh_ , _this_ [is] great _. and_ [we] _started_ taking [them] _up_ [there _.] and_ then , [all] [the] sudden _, it_ disappeared [, you know] [i] didn't _know _._ and_ we're _going_ , _oh_ , _no [,_ there] goes _our_ [recycling] _place_ . 
B|15| B: [yeah .] 
A|16| A: _that's_ really _nice to_ find _out_ [that] it's [behind] [there] [well [,] we] pretty _much_ _do_ _, um ,_ plastic [milk cartons _and] , um _,_ um _,_ um ,_ _newspapers_ _. i_ couldn't even _think_ _of what_ [you] call [them] . 
B|17| B: [yeah .] 
A|18| A: plastic [milk cartons] , _newspapers_ [and] _cans_ _, and_ glass _, i guess _,_ is the_ four _, is_ really [the] four [things] [that _we] do_ . 
B|19| B: _like_ _aluminum cans_ ? 
A|20| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|21| B: _that's [about_ what] [we do] _too ._ 
A|22| A: [and] really , [that's about] , [that's] really [about] _it ._ [is] [there] _anything_ , any _place_ [else] [that] really takes _anything_ other than [that] [, that] [you know] [of] ? 
B|23| B: _well [, i_ guess [,] um ,] _down_ [in] , _kind of_ [in] north dallas [, there] [is a] [place] _that will_ [take] almost [anything] . 
A|24| A: _oh_ , really . 
B|25| B: _uh [,_ i don't] _, we just_ [don't] [have] [the] room [to] store [all] [that] [much] [, you know ,] 
A|26| A: [i _know] ._ 
B|27| B: [i don't] want [to] [be] running _down_ [there] every week [, or] whatever . 
A|28| A: [i _know] _._ i _know_ ._ we're [kind of] [the] same way . [you know ,] _at_ first [, you know [,] [you] ,] _at_ first _it was_ [a] real _, it was_ [a] real hassle _, and_ _i'm_ wondering are [we] really _going _to_ do_ _this_ , but [you] [kind of] _get_ [, i guess ,] into [a] little routine [, you know ,] _where_ [it] becomes _, is_ automatic , now , [to] throw , different [things] [in] different _places_ , 
B|29| B: [yeah .] 
A|30| A: _you know ._ _so_ [i] [just] go [, you know , [we] _have] a_ pretty good size pantry [in] _our_ kitchen [and] i've [just] got three trash [cans] sitting [in there [,] you know [, we] just] [kind of] _dump_ [things] [in] each one _, if_ _, you know , if_ [we] _get_ [them] , 
B|31| B: [yeah .] 
A|32| A: _so_ . 
B|33| B: those [milk cartons] [take] [up] [so] [much] room . 
A|34| A: _oh_ _, they_ [do] , [too _.] and_ [they're] impossible [to] crush _. i_ mean [, you] can't _get the_ [down] [to] any size _, you know ._ _if_ [you] _get_ four [milk cartons _and] that_ fills [up] trash bag [, you know] pretty easily , [so] . [you know ,] 
B|35| B: [i guess] [we] [kind of] [started] [recycling] after [i] [moved] _here_ [about] [a] year [and] [a] half ago . 
A|36| A: _oh_ , really . 
B|37| B: [we were] using baby food _and there was_ [so] many baby food jars , [kind [of] what] [started] [it .] 
A|38| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [some] [of] [our] neighbors [were doing] [it] [and _so] [,_ you know , when] [i] found [out] [some] [places] [to take _it] [,_ [and] , um ,] _like [,_ um [,] they] also [take] [some] [things] [at] [the] flower mound [dump] [behind] [the] fire station [there [,] and [i] know] [that] [they're] _going to use_ [, you know ,] _the money_ [for] _that to_ build [some] [kind of] multipurpose field [and that] type [of] [thing .] put lights [and] stuff 
A|40| A: _oh_ [, [that] will] [be] good . 
B|41| B: _so [,_ you know , if] [i'm] not [going to] [get _the] money_ [for] _aluminum_ [, i] [would] [just] assume _give_ [it to] [the] city [of] flower mound . [to do] _something_ _with [, you know_ .] 
A|42| A: sure . let somebody [get] [something] [out] [of] [it .] 
B|43| B: [yeah [.] that's] true _. and they_ won't raise [our] taxes . 
A|44| A: [yeah] 
B|45| B: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: ha-ha [well , i] [was] [kind of] hoping [with [, you know] ,] [do] [you] work [for] t [i] ? 
B|47| B: [no [,] i don't] [. i] [have a] friend , [of] _mine_ told me [about] [this] _program_ [, is the] reason [that] [i'm] , 
A|48| A: [no] . [yeah .] [there was] [a] , t [i] has got [this] organization called t [a] d which [is] t i'ers against drugs [. [and] [,] you know ,] we're [recycling] [aluminum cans] [up] [here] [and ,] [uh ,] [just] [what] [you] [would] buy [out] [of] [the] machines [and] drink [here] [and there was] crushers [out] [in] [all of] [the] hallways [you know [,] and] [that's] [, they] [use] [the money] from [that to] fund [this] t i'ers against drugs [program] . it's [, you know ,] t [i] doesn't [give] [them] any [money] , [all] , everything [is] made from [that] [. [and they] had] talked [about] having [a] [thing] [like ,] one saturday [a] month [, you] could come [and] drop your [aluminum cans] off from home [, you know ,] 
B|49| B: [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [and] [i'm] [kind of] [like ,] [yeah [.] i] shall [, they] [would] [do] [that] [because] [at] least somebody [was] getting [the money] [out] [of] [it [,] you know .] [that] [was] [going to use] [it] [for] good , [so ,] 
B|51| B: [is] talking [to] someone [in] sorry .
