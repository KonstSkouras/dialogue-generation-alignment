A|0| A: _well_ since _you_ _live_ close _i don't_ _know if_ _you know_ _um_ _about what_ louisville _is_ _doing_ _with_ _recycling_ _or_ are _you_ familiar _with_ any _of_ _that_ ? 
B|1| B: _well _i_ know_ _that _we_ have_ _some_ relatives [that] [live] around _like_ _the_ _area_ _in there_ 
A|2| A: _huh-uh ._ 
B|3| B: _i know_ _they're_ [doing] _some_ _curbside recycling_ as _a_ _kind of_ _a_ test _there ._ 
A|4| A: _yeah ._ _you know_ [i] read _you know when_ _they_ first _started_ [doing] [that] [in] [the] paper _and i_ read _about_ [that] [i] _was_ _just_ praying [that] [that] _would_ _be_ [in] _our_ [area] _because_ we've been [recycling] _for_ quite [some] time _. and_ _you know we_ separate everything _out_ _and_ then [have] _to_ haul _it_ _up_ _to_ [a] metco _you know_ which _is a_ real pain . 
B|5| B: [huh-uh .] 
A|6| A: _so_ _if_ _they_ _would_ come _up_ [curbside recycling] 
B|7| B: they'll help [you] recycle _because we_ _there_ [is] [some] bins _like_ _behind wal-mart_ [that] _take_ [some] _things_ . 
A|8| A: [well] now [have] _they moved_ _them_ [behind wal-mart] ? 
B|9| B: [yeah .] 
A|10| A: _oh_ god . 
B|11| B: [because] [i] finally asked [because] [you know we] _had_ _all of_ those _milk cartons _and_ there was_ nowhere _else_ _to take_ [them] _and they had_ [it] [in] front [of] [wal-mart] [and i] ask _in wal-mart_ _and they_ said [they moved] [it] [just] [behind] . 
A|12| A: _oh _._ that's_ really _nice to_ [know] [because _we] _were_ doing_ [the] same _thing ._ [because] _to take _it_ to_ [a] metco [you] [have] _to take it_ _when_ [they're] open [you know] which [is] always [a] real pain . 
B|13| B: [huh-uh .] 
A|14| A: _and so_ _when_ [that] _thing_ came _up_ [in wal-mart] parking lot [we] thought _oh_ _this_ [is] great _. and_ [we] _started_ taking [them] _up_ [there _.] and_ then [all] [the] sudden [it] disappeared [you know] [i] didn't _know _._ and_ we're _going_ _oh_ _no_ [there] goes _our_ [recycling] _place_ . 
B|15| B: [yeah .] 
A|16| A: _that's_ really _nice to_ find _out_ [that] it's [behind] [there] [well] [we] pretty _much_ _do_ _um_ plastic [milk cartons _and] um_ _um_ _um_ _newspapers_ _. i_ couldn't even _think_ _of what_ [you] call [them] . 
B|17| B: [yeah .] 
A|18| A: plastic [milk cartons] _newspapers_ [and] _cans_ [and] glass _i guess_ _is the_ four [is] really [the] four [things] [that _we] do_ . 
B|19| B: _like_ _aluminum cans_ ? 
A|20| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|21| B: _that's [about_ what] [we _do] too ._ 
A|22| A: [and] really [that's about] [that's] really [about] _it ._ [is] [there] _anything_ any _place_ [else] [that] really takes _anything_ other than [that] [that] [you know] [of] ? 
B|23| B: _well [i_ guess] [um] _down_ [in] _kind of_ [in] north dallas [there] [is a] [place] _that will_ [take] almost [anything] . 
A|24| A: _oh_ really . 
B|25| B: _uh_ [i don't] _we just_ [don't] [have] [the] room [to] store [all] [that] [much] [you know] 
A|26| A: [i _know] ._ 
B|27| B: [i don't] want [to] [be] running _down_ [there] every week [or] whatever . 
A|28| A: [i _know] _._ i _know_ ._ we're [kind of] [the] same way . [you know] _at_ first [you know] [you] _at_ first _it was_ [a] real _it was_ [a] real hassle [and] _i'm_ wondering are [we] really _going _to_ do_ _this_ but [you] [kind of] _get_ [i guess] into [a] little routine [you know] _where_ [it] becomes [is] automatic now [to] throw different [things] [in] different _places_ 
B|29| B: [yeah .] 
A|30| A: _you know ._ _so_ [i] [just] go [you know [we] _have] a_ pretty good size pantry [in] _our_ kitchen [and] i've [just] got three trash [cans] sitting [in there] [you know [we] just] [kind of] _dump_ [things] [in] each one _if_ _you know if_ [we] _get_ [them] 
B|31| B: [yeah .] 
A|32| A: _so_ . 
B|33| B: those [milk cartons] [take] [up] [so] [much] room . 
A|34| A: _oh_ [they] [do too _.] and_ [they're] impossible [to] crush _. i_ mean [you] can't _get the_ [down] [to] any size _you know ._ _if_ [you] _get_ four [milk cartons _and] that_ fills [up] trash bag [you know] pretty easily [so] . [you know] 
B|35| B: [i guess] [we] [kind of] [started] [recycling] after [i] [moved] _here_ [about] [a] year [and] [a] half ago . 
A|36| A: _oh_ really . 
B|37| B: [we were] using baby food _and there was_ [so] many baby food jars [kind [of] what] [started] [it .] 
A|38| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [some] [of] [our] neighbors [were doing] [it] [and so] [you know when] [i] found [out] [some] [places] [to take it] [and um] _like_ [um] [they] also [take] [some] [things] [at] [the] flower mound [dump] [behind] [the] fire station [there] [and [i] know] [that] [they're] _going to use_ [you know] _the money_ [for] _that to_ build [some] [kind of] multipurpose field [and that] type [of] [thing .] put lights [and] stuff 
A|40| A: _oh_ [that will] [be] good . 
B|41| B: [so] [you know if] [i'm] not [going to] [get _the] money_ [for] _aluminum_ [i] [would] [just] assume _give_ [it to] [the] city [of] flower mound . [to do] _something_ _with [you know_ .] 
A|42| A: sure . let somebody [get] [something] [out] [of] [it .]

[and they] had] talked [about] having [a] [thing] [like] one saturday [a] month [you] could come [and] drop your [aluminum cans] off from home [you know] 
B|49| B: [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [and] [i'm] [kind of] [like] [yeah [.] i] shall [they] [would] [do] [that] [because] [at] least somebody [was] getting [the money] [out] [of] [it] [you know .] [that] [was] [going to use] [it] [for] good [so] 
B|51| B: [is] talking [to] someone [in] sorry .
