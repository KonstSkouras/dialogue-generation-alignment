A|2| A: _do_ _you_ ? 
B|3| B: [well] _yes_ _of_ course _we do_ _have_ capital punishment . _and_ we've _you know_ done away _with_ _our_ quote fair share number . 
A|4| A: _oh_ _that's right_ _i think_ _now_ _that i_ recall _reading_ _about it_ _in the_ paper . 
B|5| B: _yes ._ 
A|6| A: um [you know] different _things_ _is_ _it_ restricted _to_ _certain crimes_ ? _or_ _just_

B|9| B: _it seems_ _to be_ _a_ disproportionate number _of_ blacks [you know] [that] _get_ into [the] system . 
A|10| A: _yes i_ [know] [the] _one_ [thing] _that _i_ think_ _is_ _really_ sad _about it_ as _i_ recall from [the] articles [that] i've read _is_ [that] _if_ _if_ _people_ who [have] _been_ _there_ _are_ going [to be] _killed_ . um _there's_ _people_ [that] come [to] [the] prisons [and] _they're_ _very_ violent [and] _they_ want _i_ mean _they're_ anxious _for_ someone [to be] _killed_ 
B|11| B: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ 
A|12| A: _i_ _just_ _i_ can't see _that ._ 
B|13| B: [that] happens _on_ occasion [it] _sure_ _does_ _maybe_ [it] [just] depends _on_ [you _know] how_ closely _the crime_ [you know] _has_ affected _you personally_ .

B|15| B: [you _know] _i_ don't know_ [or] _a_ person _personally_ . 
A|16| A: _no ._ 
B|17| B: [i think] _i _would_ be_ [you _know] _i_ guess_ [really] [if] _i had_ [to] _say_ [yes] [or] _no _i_ guess_ _i would_ _say_ [you know] [that [i] am] [in] [certain] cases [in] favor _of_ [the] _death_ penalty _i don't know_ [that] _it's a_ big deterrent [really] _. i don't know_ _that _it_ is_ _. i don't know how_ we'd ever find _out_ [you know] [really] whether _it is_ [or] _not_ . 
A|18| A: [well] _there_ [is] _so_ many chances _for_ _appeal_ [that it] 
B|19| B: [oh] _yeah_ [oh] absolutely _yeah_ [it] goes _on_ [for] years [and] years [and] costs hundreds _of_ thousands _of_ dollars taxpayer money . 
A|20| A: [it's] [really] sad . 
B|21| B: _yeah ._ 
A|22| A: [i don't [know] i] [just] [think] um somehow [i] hoped [that] as [a] _people_ [we] could [be] better than than um expecting [the] feeling [that it] 
B|23| B: _yes ._ 
A|24| A: [with] someone [is] calling [for] someone _else_ [to be] _killed_ [you _know] ._ [is] [really] kind [of] bad 
B|25| B: [yes] _it is_ . _it's a_ tough tough question . [it] [really] [is] _. i_ suspect _i _would_ be_ _uh_ [you know] _a lot_ _more_ favor [of] [it] [if] [you know] [one] [of] my _children_ were [you know] brutally [killed] [or] _something_ _like_ [that .] _like_ [i] _say_ [i think] [it] depends _on_ _how_ _personally_ affected [you know] [you] might [be] by _it ._ 
A|26| A: [and] _there_ [really] _are_ criminals [that] _are_ hard-core [and] repeat [and] _never_ [have] any chance [for] 
B|27| B: [oh] absolutely . _that's right ._ 
A|28| A: [oh] [i don't know] [is] [it] [do] [you] feel at all [like] [it's a] religious issue ? 
B|29| B: _not_ [with] me _personally_ . _it is_ [with] _a lot of_ _other_ [people] . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: _it's not_ _not_ [to] me _personally_ [no .] 
A|32| A: um . 
B|33| B: [no .] 
A|34| A: [i don't know] sometimes [i] feel [i] mean [i] [do] _go_ [to] church [and] _things_ [. i don't know how] [i would] feel _about [it_ _.] but_ [like] [you] [say] [if] [it] hit [you personally] closer at home [you] [would] feel feel differently . 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ [that's] [a] [it's a] tough tough question [it] [really] [is] . 
A|36| A: [do] [you] _think most states_ [have] [that] [or] ? 
B|37| B: [yes [i] [think] most states] [do] [have] capital punishment . _yes [._ _but] [i_ think] [the] u s [is] [one] [of] [the] few countries _that still_ _do ._ 
A|38| A: [that still] [does] [it] [that's right .] 
B|39| B: [yes] [they're] only [i] _was_ [reading] _something_ [about it] _the other_ _day_ [i think] [there] _was_ only [like] six [or] eight countries [in the] world _that have_ capital punishment [still] . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: _a lot of_ them _had_ _to have_ elected _not_ _to do_ [so] . [now] [i don't [know] what] _they do_ [in] place [of] [it .] [you know] _maybe_ [it's] _life_ [in] prisonment [or] [you know] _something_ [i] [i don't know _how] they_ handle [it] [i] _was_ surprised [to] learn [that] [so] few countries [have] capital punishment . 
A|42| A: [have] [that .] [well] [and] [it] doesn't _seem_ [like] _very_ many [people] [uh] _are_ [really] [i] mean _there's a lot of_ [people] [that] _are_ [on] [death] row [. but] _there's_ [not] _very_ many [people] [that] actually um . _do get_ [killed] . 
B|43| B: [oh] _yes ._ [yes] [a lot of] them [do get] their sentences commuted [to] _something_ [else] . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh _.] so_ [it seems] [like] [a] [of] [people] live [there] [and] then _through_ appeals . 
B|45| B: _yes ._ 
A|46| A: because [i] [know] [they do] frequently [i] mean [they] cover cover [it] pretty heavily [on] television [and] [the] newspaper . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ 
A|48| A: [if] [it] finally gets [to] [that] point . 
B|49| B: [right] [the] first [appeal] [is] automatic [so] [that] delays [it] [for] [a] few years [just] [right] off [the] bat . 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [there's] [there's a lot of] [you know] last minute [uh] [things] [that] happen cause [a] person [not] _to _have to_ go_ [through] [the] whole [thing] . 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh _.] so_ [is] [it] [uh] _are_ [we] doing _lethal injection_ [now] ? 
B|53| B: [yes] [uh-huh .] [that's] [that's] fairly recent [i don't know how] recent [but] fairly recent [in the state] [of] [texas] . before [that it] _was_ [uh] [death] by electrocution . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] which [seems] [so] awful . 
B|55| B: [yes] [it] certainly [does] . 
A|56| A: [so] [it's a] little bit [more] humane [i guess] [it is] 
B|57| B: [yes] [it] [would] almost _have [to_ be] [i] suppose . [if] [you] [if] [you] _had_ [to] chose [i guess] [i would] [i am] _sure_ [i would] take [the] [lethal injection] . 
A|58| A: [yes] [the other] [one] [just] [seems] [so] terrible . 
B|59| B: [yes] absolutely . 
A|60| A: um . 
B|61| B: [it's a] [it's a] tough question . [it] [really] [is] [. [i] guess] [if] _i had_ [to] [say] [yes] [or] _no [i_ would] [say] [you know] _yes [._ i] [i would] _have to_ lean toward capital punishment [you know] [for] [certain crimes] . 
A|62| A: [well] [do] [you] [think] [that] [we do] [it] because [we] want [it] [to] deter [crime] [or] [it's not] because [we] [don't] want [to] pay [for] inmates [to] stay [in] prison ? 
B|63| B: _no [i_ don't] [think] [it's a] monetary [thing] . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [i think] [we] _hope_ [that it] _will_ [be] [you know] some sort [of] deterrent [or] [you know] an eye [for] an eye type [thing] [or] _something_ [like] [that .] 
A|66| A: um . 
B|67| B: some [of] [the] [crimes] [are] [just] [so] brutal _and so_ [you know] useless . _this_ may [seem] [to be] [the] best _way_ _out_ [. i don't [know] .] 
A|68| A: [yes .] 
B|69| B: easiest _way_ _out_ _maybe_ . _no [i_ don't] [think] [it's a] monetary [thing] . 
A|70| A: um . [well] um [and] [i] notice [that] [the crime] _rate_ [was] up [in the] dallas area _it's it's_ kind [of] _been_ scary [to] [think] [about it] 
B|71| B: [yes] especially [the] murder [rate] its [just] gone crazy . [yes .] 
A|72| A: [and] [and] you're hoping [there] [is] [something] [that] [will] cut down [on] [that .] 
B|73| B: absolutely . [yes i] wish _i had_ [the] answer [for] [that] everybody [does] . 
A|74| A: [you] hate [to have] [the] dubious honor [of] being [you know] [so] high [in the] [in] statistics 
B|75| B: [yes] [it's] nothing [to be] proud [of] certainly [not] . 
A|76| A: [but i] [you know] [we] [have] _been_ [really] _fortunate_ [our] family hasn't [had] any [crime] . 
B|77| B: [yes .] [yes] [so] [have] [we] [been] [very] [very] [fortunate] . 
A|78| A: [and so] [we] [don't] [it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor [people] [that have] suffered [that] [way] . 
B|79| B: [that's right .] absolutely . 
A|80| A: [and] [how they] [would] expect [how they] [would] [hope] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [i] mean [you] [you] hear [of] [people] who [have] um committed [crimes] [and] then [they] [get] [out] [of] jail [and] [they] [go] [and] [they do] [the] same [thing] again . 
B|83| B: absolutely . 
A|84| A: [and] [you] wonder why [they] can't [just] stop [it .] 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] [that's right .] 
A|86| A: [so] [maybe] [you] [would] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [but] [still] [i would] hate [to be] [on] [the] jury [that] sentenced someone . 
B|89| B: [so] [would] [i] [i] _fortunately i_ [have] [never] [been] [in] [that] circumstance [i] [hope] [i] [never] [am] [like] [like] everybody [else] . 
A|90| A: [no i] [know] when um [we] [just] [we] moved here [uh] [i] from [the] [i] got [a] summons jury summons 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [just] [like] constantly [it] seemed [like] 
B|93| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [but] [fortunately [i] had] small [children] [and] [i] didn't [have to go] . 
B|95| B: [right .] 
A|96| A: [and] [it's not] [that i] mean [i think] everyone should [have to] serve [on] [the] jury 
B|97| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [it's] [just] [that i] didn't [i] hate having [to be] [in] charge [of] someone else's [life] . 
B|99| B: _sure_ [it's [it's] a] big responsibility [it] [really] [is] . 
A|100| A: [and] [i would] hate [to have to] hear any kind [of] case involving [a] violent [crime] [or] anything . 
B|101| B: [yes [.] so] [would] [i] . 
A|102| A: [that] [would be] [really] awful . 
B|103| B: [yes .] absolutely . 
A|104| A: [well] anyway [i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [uh] _talking to you_ [about] [this] . although [it] [has] [been] difficult [but] [uh] . 
B|105| B: [it is] [it's a] tough subject [it] [really] [is] . 
A|106| A: i'd hate [to] decide [it] [but [i] guess] [uh] [guess] [it's] important [that] [we] decide as [a] [people] [what] [what] we're going [to [do] .] 
B|107| B: [right .] [that's right .] 
A|108| A: anyway [well] [you] [have] [a] good [day] . 
B|109| B: [well] _thank you_ [it's] nice [talking to you] . 
A|110| A: [thank you] _bye-bye ._
