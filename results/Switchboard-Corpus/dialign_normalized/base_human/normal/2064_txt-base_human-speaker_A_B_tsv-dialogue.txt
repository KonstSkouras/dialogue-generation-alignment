A|20| A: [it's] [really] sad . 
B|21| B: _yeah ._ 
A|22| A: [i don't [know ,] i] [just] _think ,_ um , somehow [i] hoped [that] as [a] _people_ [we] could [be] better than , than , um , expecting _, the_ feeling [that it] 
B|23| B: _yes ._ 
A|24| A: [with] , someone [is] calling [for] someone _else_ [to be] _killed [,_ you _know] ._ [is] [really] kind [of] bad 
B|25| B: [yes] _it is_ . _it's a_ tough , tough question . [it] [really] [is] _. i_ suspect _i _would_ be_ _, uh [,_ you know ,] _a lot_ _more_ favor [of] [it] [if [,] you know ,] [one] [of] my _children_ were [, you know ,] brutally [killed ,] [or] _something_ _like_ [that .] _like_ [i] _say [,_ i think] [it] depends _on_ _how_ _personally_ affected [, you know [,] you] might [be] by _it ._ 
A|26| A: [and] _there_ [really] _are_ criminals [that] _are_ hard-core [and] , repeat [, and] _never_ [have] any chance [for] , 
B|27| B: [oh ,] absolutely . _that's right ._ 
A|28| A: [oh [,] i don't know ,] [is] [it] , [do] [you] feel at all _like _,_ it's a_ religious issue ? 
B|29| B: _not_ [with] me _personally_ . _it is_ [with] _a lot of_ _other_ [people] . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: _it's not_ , _not_ [to] me _personally ,_ [no .] 
A|32| A: um . 
B|33| B: [no .] 
A|34| A: [i don't know ,] sometimes [i] feel [, i] mean [i] [do] _go_ [to] church [and] _things_ [. i don't know how] [i would] feel _about [it_ _.] but_ [like] [you] [say _,] if_ [it] hit [you [personally] ,] closer at home [you] [would] feel , feel differently . 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ [that's] [a] [, it's a] tough , tough question _, it_ [really] [is] . 
A|36| A: [do] [you] _think most states_ [have] [that] [or] ? 
B|37| B: [yes [, i] [think] most states] [do] [have] capital punishment . _yes [._ _but] [,_ i think] [the] u s [is] [one] [of] [the] few countries _that still_ _do ._ 
A|38| A: [that still] [does] [it] _, [that's_ right .] 
B|39| B: [yes ,] [they're] only [, i] _was_ [reading] _something_ [about it] _the other_ _day_ [, i think] [there] _was_ only [like] six [or] eight countries [in the] world [, _that] have_ capital punishment [still] . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: _a lot of_ them _had_ _to have_ elected _not_ _to do_ [so] . [now] [i don't know _,] what_ _they do_ [in] place [of] [it .] [you know _,] maybe_ [it's] _life_ [in] prisonment _or [,_ you know ,] _something_ [, i] [i don't know _how] they_ handle [it] [i] _was_ surprised [to] learn [that] [so] few countries [have] capital punishment . 
A|42| A: [have] [that .] [well [,] and] [it] doesn't _seem_ [like] _very_ many [people] [, uh ,] _are_ [really] [, i] mean _, there's a lot of_ [people] [that] _are_ [on] [death] row [. but] _there's_ [not] _very_ many [people] [that] actually , um . _do get_ [killed] . 
B|43| B: [oh ,] _yes ._ [yes ,] [a lot of] them [do get] their sentences commuted [to] _something_ [else] . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh _.] _so_ [,_ [it] seems] [like] [a] [of] [people] live [there] [, and] then _through_ appeals . 
B|45| B: _yes ._ 
A|46| A: because [i] [know] [they do] frequently [, i] mean [they] cover , cover [it] pretty heavily [on] television [and] [the] newspaper . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ 
A|48| A: [if] [it] finally gets [to] [that] point . 
B|49| B: [right [,] the] first [appeal] [is] automatic [, so] [that] delays [it] [for] [a] few years [just] [right] off [the] bat . 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [there's] [, there's a lot of] [, you know ,] last minute [, uh ,] [things] [that] happen cause [a] person [not] [to] , _have to go_ [through] [the] whole [thing] . 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh _.] so_ [is] [it] [, uh ,] _are_ [we] doing _lethal injection_ [now] ? 
B|53| B: [yes ,] [uh-huh .] [that's] [, that's] fairly recent [, i don't know _,] how_ recent _, but_ fairly recent [, in the state] [of] [texas] . before _that [,_ it] _was_ [, uh ,] [death] by electrocution . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] , which [seems] [so] awful . 
B|55| B: [yes [,] it] certainly [does] . 
A|56| A: _so [,_ it's a] little bit [more] humane [, i guess [,] _it] is ,_ 
B|57| B: [yes [,] it] [would] almost _have [to_ be] [, i] suppose . [if] _you [,_ if] [you] _had_ [to] chose [, i guess] [i _would] [,_ i am] _sure_ [i would] take [the] [lethal injection] . 
A|58| A: [yes [,] [the] other] [one] [just] [seems] [so] terrible . 
B|59| B: [yes ,] absolutely . 
A|60| A: um . 
B|61| B: [it's a] [, it's a] tough question . [it] [really] [is] [. [i] guess [,] if] _i had_ [to] [say] [yes] [or] _no , [i_ would] [say [,] you know ,] _yes [._ _i] [,_ [i] would] _have to_ lean toward capital punishment [, you know ,] [for] [certain crimes] . 
A|62| A: [well ,] [do] [you] [think] [that] [we do] [it] because [we] want [it] [to] deter [crime] [or [,] [it's] not] because [we] [don't] want [to] pay [for] inmates [to] stay [in] prison ? 
B|63| B: _no [, i_ don't] [think] [it's a] monetary [thing] . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [i [think] _,] we_ _hope_ [that it] _will_ [be] [, you know ,] some sort [of] deterrent [or [,] you know ,] an eye [for] an eye type [thing] , [or] _something_ [like] [that .] 
A|66| A: um . 
B|67| B: some [of] [the] [crimes] [are] [just] [so] brutal [and] [so [,] you know ,] useless . _this_ may [seem] [to be] [the] best _way_ _out_ [. i don't [know] .] 
A|68| A: [yes .] 
B|69| B: easiest _way_ _out_ _maybe_ . _no [, i_ don't] [think] [it's a] monetary [thing] . 
A|70| A: um . [well ,] um [, and] [i] notice [that] [the crime] _rate_ [was] up [in the] dallas area _it's , it's_ kind [of] _been_ scary , [to] [think] [about it] 
B|71| B: [yes ,] especially [the] murder [rate] , its [just] gone crazy . [yes .] 
A|72| A: [and] [, and] you're hoping [there] [is] [something] [that] [will] cut down [on] [that .] 
B|73| B: absolutely . [yes , i] wish _i had_ [the] answer [for] _that ,_ everybody [does] . 
A|74| A: [you] hate [to have] [the] dubious honor [of] being [, you know [,] so] high [in the] [, in] statistics , 
B|75| B: [yes [,] it's] nothing [to be] proud [of] , certainly [not] . 
A|76| A: [but] [i [,] you know [,] we] [have] _been_ [really] _fortunate_ [our] family , hasn't [had] any [crime] . 
B|77| B: [yes .] [yes [,] so] [have] [we] [been] [very] , [very] [fortunate] . 
A|78| A: [and] [, so] [we] [don't] [, it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor [people] [that have] suffered [that] [way] . 
B|79| B: [that's right .] absolutely . 
A|80| A: [and] [how they] [would] expect [, [how] they] [would] [hope] , 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [i] mean [you [,] you] hear [of] [people] who [have] , um , committed [crimes [,] and] then [they] [get] [out] [of] jail [and] [they] [go] [, and] [they do] [the] same [thing] again . 
B|83| B: absolutely . 
A|84| A: [and] [you] wonder why [they] can't [just] stop [it .] 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] [that's right .] 
A|86| A: [so [,] maybe] [you] [would ,] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [but] [still] [i would] hate [to be] [on] [the] jury [that] sentenced someone . 
B|89| B: [so] [would] [i [,] i] _fortunately_ [, i] [have] [never] [been] [in] [that] circumstance [, i] [hope] [i] [never] [am] , [like ,] [like] everybody [else] . 
A|90| A: [no , i] [know] when , um [, we] [just] [, we] moved here [, uh [,] i] from [the] [, i] got [a] summons , jury summons , 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [just] [like] constantly [, it] seemed [like ,] 
B|93| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [but] [fortunately] [i had] small [children] [and] [i] didn't [have to go] . 
B|95| B: [right .] 
A|96| A: [and] [it's not] [that [,] i] mean [, i think] everyone should [have to] serve [on] [the] jury , 
B|97| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [it's] [just] [that [,] i] didn't [, i] hate having [to be] [in] charge [of] someone else's [life] . 
B|99| B: _sure_ [, [it's] [, it's] a] big responsibility [, it] [really] [is] . 
A|100| A: [and] [i would] hate [to [have] to] hear any kind [of] case , involving [a] violent [crime] [or] anything . 
B|101| B: [yes [.] so] [would] [i] . 
A|102| A: [that] [would be] [really] awful . 
B|103| B: [yes .] absolutely . 
A|104| A: [well ,] anyway [, i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [, uh ,] _talking to you_ [about] [this] . although [it] [has] [been] difficult [but [,] uh] . 
B|105| B: [it is [,] it's a] tough subject [, it] [really] [is] . 
A|106| A: i'd hate [to] decide [it] [, but] [i guess [,] uh ,] [guess] [it's] important [, that] [we] decide as [a] [people] [what] [, what] we're going [to [do] .] 
B|107| B: [right .] [that's right .] 
A|108| A: anyway , [well [,] you] [have] [a] good [day] . 
B|109| B: [well ,] _thank you [,_ it's] nice [talking to you] . 
A|110| A: [thank you ,] _bye-bye ._
