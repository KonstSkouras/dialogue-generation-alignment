A|0| A: okay . _so_ _uh_ mike _what_ _are_ _your_ opinions _on_ _uh_ trial _by_ _jury_ ? 
B|1| B: _well_ i _work_ _for_ _an_ _insurance_ company [so] i see _a_ lot _of_ [uh] verdicts _that_ [are] pretty crazily decided . um [by] juries particularly and i know _in_ england _the_ judges set all _of the_ awards . _you_ know juries _will_ decide _the_ guilt _or_ innocence _but_ then _they_ _leave_ _the_ awards _up to_ _more_ learned people . and i _think_ maybe _that_ avoids _some_ _of_ these totally ridiculous _you_ know _like_ millions and millions _of_ dollars 
A|2| A: uh-huh _. yeah ._ _that that_ seems [to] make _sense_ [but] [leave] _it_ [up _to] the_ [more] experienced _person_ _who_ knows _how_ _it_ fits _into the_ [uh] _kind [of_ the] rate [for] different . 
B|3| B: _oh_ exactly . each individual [jury] really doesn't _have_ any perception [of] [what] um [the] _going_ _you_ know _if_ _you_ _will_ [the] _going_ [uh] award _should_ be [for] _a_ certain _type_ [of] case _you_ know within _some_ [kind of] range . 
A|4| A: uh-huh . 
B|5| B: when _you_ _get_ one way _out_ _like_ [that] [but] then really doesn't wind [up] penalizing [the] [person] [that] _they_ went after . [who] [it] really penalizes is _their_ _insurance_ company which then translates [into] higher rates [for] all [of] us . _if _they_ get_ _some_ [of] those mega awards against them . 
A|6| A: _right_ . 
B|7| B: _you_ know they're not _going to_ sit there and lose money . _if they_ [are] _losing_ money then they're _going to_ raise rates . 
A|8| A: _right_ . [they] 
B|9| B: [so] [it] all comes filtering down [to] us all individually . 
A|10| A: _right_ . 
B|11| B: and [uh] granted _some_ people need [to] be compensated _if they have_ really been wronged _you_ know . 
A|12| A: [well] _how_ _do_ [you] feel _about_ setting [like] [well] [for] example [a] car [type] _accident_ _where_ [uh] [or] [some] incident _where_ someone loses [a] _limb_ . _do_ [you] [think] [the] [jury] _should have_ [a] dollar figure [for] [losing] [an] arm [a] dollar figure [for] [losing] different body parts ? 
B|13| B: i don't know . [you] know [some] [of the] health _insurance_ is written [that] way . [you] know [that] [uh] _if_ [you] buy [an] [accident] and death [or] dismemberment policy [you] know [it] pre specified _in_ [the] policy [so] much [but] i don't know [that] [you] can necessarily _put_ [a] [a] value [on] somebody's [limb] [uh] arbitrarily [that] is always _going to_ fit _in_ all cases . 
A|14| A: uh-huh . 
B|15| B: i [think] maybe [you] look at [uh] [the] age [of the] [person] and _their_ station _in_ life and and [uh] [how] much longer _they have_ [of] _work_ years [that] [they] would _have _to_ put_ [up] [you] know with with [that] . i mean maybe [you] don't award [an] eighty-five year old guy [the] same thing [that] [you] would award [a] twenty-one year old . 
A|16| A: huh . 
B|17| B: i i [think] [it] has [to] be [some] [kind of] common [sense] applied there . and there may be [where] [the] judiciary is [a] little [more] learned [about] [that] [type] [of] thing because [they] can be schooled _in_ [that] [kind of] thing 
A|18| A: uh-huh . 
B|19| B: and [that] can be part [of] continuing education maybe [for] judges 
A|20| A: _yeah ._ 
B|21| B: i don't know . 
A|22| A: _right_ . 
B|23| B: [you] know [to] _get_ [into the] economics [of] things [uh] because _if they_ wheel somebody [into] [a] courtroom and [the] jury's heart goes _out_ [to] [that] [person] and [they] [do] one [of] these mega awards [it] really [you] know ultimately is not penalizing [the] [person] [that] they're trying [for] _get_ away . 
A|24| A: _yeah _._ that's_ true . 
B|25| B: _if_ it's [a] company [you] know [that] they're _insured_ . unless [the] award is [so] staggering [that] [it] goes all beyond _their_ layers [of] _insurance_ which is another pet peeve [of] mine when [they] [do] award punitive damages 
A|26| A: huh . 
B|27| B: i [think] those [should] be uninsurable . i [think] those [should _have] to_ be paid [by] [the] corporation itself [that that] did [the] damage . 
A|28| A: [oh] _out of_ _as_ opposed _to the_ [insurance] paying [the] bills 
B|29| B: [yeah [.] yeah .] 
A|30| A: uh-huh . [well] we're [who] [who] 
B|31| B: [for] [for] honest mistakes [where] they've done something and and something happens . one _of their_ employees causes damage [or] something . _sure [._ that's] [what] [they] buy [insurance] [for] . 
A|32| A: [do] [they get] [they get] [insured] [they get] [insured] from other [insurance] companies [or] [how] does [that] [work] ? 
B|33| B: [well] i was just _talking about_ any company . [uh] let's just say [a] lumber manufacturing company 
A|34| A: [oh] okay _your_ [talking about] 
B|35| B: and [uh] somebody is [on] [the] premises 
A|36| A: [sure .] 
B|37| B: and one [of the] employees actually is driving [by] with [a] forklift and he pushes [the] wrong button and he drops [a] load [of] lumber [on] somebody and [it] injures them . 
A|38| A: okay . [well] 
B|39| B: [sure .] [insurance] [should] pay [for] [that] . 
A|40| A: [but] [in] [some] instances you're [going [to] put] companies _out of_ business [by] taking [that] stance [if they [have] to] take [it] _out of their own_ retained earnings . 
B|41| B: [well] i'm not [talking about] any loss . i was [talking about] only losses [that] [are] judged [for] [a] punitive damage which is another category [of the] juries [are] awarding damages these days based [on] [the] person's actual injuries and [what] [they] [are] due . and then [they] [are] awarding [a] second amount [as] punishment [to the] company which is [a] usually [a] lot less . [but] it's [an] [an] amount they're designed [to] sting them [a] little [for] [their] negligence . [for] gross wanton negligence [in] [a] claim . 
A|42| A: [that] [for] [oh] uh-huh . 
B|43| B: and unfortunately [the] [the] lately [the] courts [have] been deciding [that] those could be paid [for] [by] [insurance] too . 
A|44| A: uh-huh . 
B|45| B: [so] again [it] never really penalizes [the] company doing [the] wrong . 
A|46| A: _right_ . [that] [will] 
B|47| B: [they] can go [right] [on] doing [the] same old thing [they] always used [to] . 
A|48| A: huh . 
B|49| B: and [if] [if they] know [some] practice is wrong [you] know i'm not [talking about] [your] isolated occurrences i'm [talking] [more] [about] [the] [you] know [the] thing [that] [they] know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] know is hurting people [out] there and [they] continue [to] [do] [it] even after [they] become aware [of] [that] . 
A|50| A: [sure .] okay . 
B|51| B: then i [think] [they] ought [to] [have to] pay something [out of their own] pocket .
