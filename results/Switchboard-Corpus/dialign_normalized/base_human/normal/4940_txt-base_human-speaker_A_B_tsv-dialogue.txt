A|30| A: huh-uh . 
B|31| B: [yeah .] methanol ? 
A|32| A: huh . no 
B|33| B: [yeah _.] well_ _that's_ [big] up [here] _because_ [of] _the_ [they] grow [a] lot [of] corn 
A|34| A: [oh] [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|35| B: [uh] _that's_ _one_ thing _that they_ [do] . _at_ [that] _it's pretty_ easy [to] [do] . 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [and] _the_ [uh] unfortunately [it] still contributes [to] global warming _cause_ [you] [have to] _you know_ wipe out forests [to] grow corn [and] _things_ [like] [that .] 
A|38| A: [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|39| B: _it doesn't make sense ._ [uh] [but] [it's _you] know_ _one_ [of] _the_ most [uh] productive crop [in] _the_ world [is] corn .

B|41| B: [yeah .] 
A|42| A: [yeah .] huh . 
B|43| B: [drive] cars [with] catalytic converters [and] all [that .] [it's] interesting . _they're they're_ looking _at_ [there's] _some_ work being done _on_ [uh] automobiles [that] are electrical powered 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and uh] _they're_ looking _at_ [where] [you] [have] [a] battery operated car basically [but] [it] has _a a_ engine [in] _the_ back [that] charges [it .] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [so] _the_ engine kicks _on_ _when_ _the_ batteries need power [and] [it] turns off . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: interesting thing about gas [is] _when_ [i mean] about battery powered cars [is] _when_ you're _at a_ stop light you're [not] using [any] [any] energy 
A|50| A: huh [that] [is] _good_ .

A|58| A: [oh] . 
B|59| B: _very_ interesting . 
A|60| A: [that] would be nice [. i] think [i] saw [that] [on] t v [one] time . [they] maybe [it] [was] c n n [where] [they] were demonstrating [that .] [or] _something_ similar [to] [that .]

A|70| A: [well] [yeah [.] yeah .] 
B|71| B: kind [of] interesting [so] [see] . 
A|72| A: [well] [it doesn't make sense .] [because] if [they] want [people] [to] convert [you know] . [they] should [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh . yeah] [it's] top speed [is] [something] [like] eighty [miles an hour _.] so_ [it's] [a] [good] [good] vehicle . 
A|74| A: [yeah [.] yeah .] um [. well] i'll tell [you] . sometimes [it's] [it's pretty bad] [here] . [like] today [i] think [it] [was] [pretty bad [.] i] [don't] [know] if [it] [was] if [it's] [just] [uh the] allergies [or] [what] [but] [some] days [it's] [very] nice [here] downtown
