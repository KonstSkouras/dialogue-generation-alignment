B|47| B: [so] _the_ engine kicks _on_ _when_ _the_ batteries need power [and] [it] turns off . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: interesting thing about gas [is] _when_ [, i mean] , about battery powered cars [is] _when_ you're _at a_ stop light , you're [not] using [any] [any] energy 
A|50| A: huh [that] [is] _good_ .

B|71| B: kind [of] interesting [so] [see] . 
A|72| A: _well [,_ [it] doesn't make sense .] [because] if [they] want [people] [to] convert [, you know] . [they] should [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh . yeah] [it's] top speed [is] [something] [like] eighty [miles an hour _.] so_ [it's] [a] [good] , [good] vehicle . 
A|74| A: [yeah [.] yeah .] um [. well] i'll tell [you] . sometimes [it's [,] it's pretty bad] [here] . [like] today [i] think [it] [was] [pretty bad [.] i] [don't] [know] if [it] [was] , if [it's] [just] [, uh , the] allergies [or] [what] [but] [some] days [it's] [very] nice [here] downtown 
B|75| B: [uh-huh] 
A|76| A: [and] other days [it's] [just] [really] [bad] , [so [,] i] [don't] [know] [. so] [what] , [what] kinds [of] [things] did [you] experience [in l a] [when] [you] were [there] ? [or] _can_ [you] remember ? were [you] [there] [at a] ?
