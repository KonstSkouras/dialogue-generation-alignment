A|16| A: [yeah ,] _really_ , especially _in_ texas 
B|17| B: [oh [,] i] [know] _it_ [the last] gubernatorial race _was _,_ oh_ _it was_ awful . 
A|18| A: _it really_ [was _,] yeah ._ 
B|19| B: [so] _i [don't_ [know] [,] i] [, i] , it'll _be_ interesting [to] see how [the] [next] [, uh ,] few years [go] . 
A|20| A: [yeah] [did] [they] [get] [the] _serious_ _problem_ [that] half _the people_ [don't] [vote .] 
B|21| B: [yeah , i [think] , well _,] it's_ _, it's_ definitely _a_ [problem] _, and _i_ think it could_ [get] worse . 
A|22| A: _yeah ._ 
B|23| B: [you know ,] we [get] this lackadaisical attitude _, and_ say , huh [, you know , why] _should_ we [vote] , then [, you know _,] _it_ could_ _, uh , _it_ could_ lead [to] some [serious] things . 
A|24| A: _yeah ._ [it] [also] [seems] _like_ maybe another _candidate_ [that] [nobody] wants [could] slip _in_ _if_ [, you know _,] not_ _enough_ [people] _are_ [voting .] 
B|25| B: _uh-huh _._ [right_ [,] uh [,] [yeah] ,] we _can_ [get] [, uh [,] [yeah] _,] if_ we [get] someone [in] there [like _that] ,_ then [, you know ,] [they] _could make_ [all] sorts [of] changes _that they_ _were_ [, you know ,] had [enough] pull . 
A|26| A: [yeah [,] it's] kind [of] [like] [in] _louisiana_ _where_ [that , uh ,] _guy_ _that's_ [like] [a] ku klux klan member _something_ _got_ _elected_ . 
B|27| B: yes . _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: kind [of] scary when [you] [think] [about] [that] .

A|30| A: [oh ,] gosh . 
B|31| B: [yeah ,] lyndon larouche [, that's] [it] . 
A|32| A: _yeah ._ 
B|33| B: [and] [, uh [,] yeah .] 
A|34| A: [yeah ,] [people] _will_ sit home [and] assume [, [oh] _,] that_ [guy] _would_ never _get elected_ . 
B|35| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: [next] thing [you know _,] you've got_ _him ._ 
B|37| B: [right .] _if [you_ don't] [go and vote] , then [, you know ,] very [good] chance _that they_ , [they] [will] _because_ _a lot [of_ [the] people] [like [that] ,] they'll strike [a] chord [in] [something] [, you know ,] [in] some [of [the] people] [, that] [so] [will] say , look [, you know ,] this guy's [got] _everything_ together . 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [you know [,] i] [like] [what] _he_ says _, and_ he'll _be_ [so] far off [the] wall [that] they'll elect [him .] 
A|40| A: [right [,] yeah .] 
B|41| B: [and] [, uh [,] i think] [that's] sort [of] [what] happened [with] [louisiana] _because_ , _because_ , um _, the_ [guy] [did] [get elected] , correct ? 
A|42| A: [yeah [.] [right] .] 
B|43| B: [that's] [what] [i] thought . 
A|44| A: [yeah ,] [he] sure [did] . 
B|45| B: [and] [, uh ,] _, but_ [you know ,] [they] _can_ always fool us [, you know] . [he] might _do_ [a] [good] job . 
A|46| A: [yeah _.] [i_ think] [one] thing [that] maybe _would_ help [people] [vote] [is] [if] _the polls_ [were] either _open_ _more_ days _, or_ [you] [could] mail [it] _in _,_ or_ [something] [like] [, [if] you] _have [,_ [if] you] [have] real strict work _hours_ [, and] _you can_ only [go] [like] [at] seven [in] [the] morning _or_ after work [and] [you] _have to_ stand _in line_ [for] [so] _long_ 
B|47| B: _oh , yeah ._ 
A|48| A: [i _think] that_ discourages [a lot of people] . 
B|49| B: [what] we _do_ , _usually_ , [is] [, uh ,] [vote] [, uh ,] absenteeism 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [and] [, uh [,] i] [know ,] _here_ [, you know [,] [you] don't] [have to] [have] any reason [, [you] can] _just_ [go and vote] 
A|52| A: [right .] 
B|53| B: [and] [the polls] [are] [open] _, what_ [was] _it ,_ [a] couple [of] weeks _, the_ [hours] [are] [good] _and they're_ even [open] _on_ saturdays [and] [a] couple [of] sundays . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [and] [so] we've [got] plenty [of] _time [to_ go] , _because_ down _here_ [in] houston [, it's] [, uh _,] the_ _lines_ [are] [long] . 
A|56| A: [yeah _,] i'm_ [in] dallas [, [and] they're] [long] [here] too . 
B|57| B: _so [,_ uh _,] but , uh ,_ 
A|58| A: [yeah , i] voted absentee [one] year _. i_ _really_ [was] going [to] [be] [gone] [. so [,] i] [did] [it [,] but [, uh ,] [it] was] nice _. i_ _would_ [be] tempted [to] [do] [it] again . 
B|59| B: [well [,] uh [,] i] recommend [it ,] _because_ [you] _just_ walk [right] _on_ [in [,] and] there's _usually_ [not] anybody [in line] 
A|60| A: [right .] 
B|61| B: [and] [, uh [,] you know [,] that] vote's _just_ as [good] as [, you know _,] the_ [one] _on_ [election] day . 
A|62| A: [yeah _.] [i_ think] [they should] change [the] whole [system] [so] [that] [it's] easier 
B|63| B: _uh-huh [,_ yeah .] 
A|64| A: [i think] _more_ [people] _would_ [do] [it] _if it_ wasn't _such a_ hassle . 
B|65| B: um [, [yeah] ,] i've been involved [with] [, uh ,] some [of the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of the] , [of the] republican _party_ . [and] [it's] [really] interesting [to] see [the] process as far as [what] _goes_ through as far as [the] [voting] [and] [the] [, uh ,] how [the] [, uh _,] the_ [not] [the] ballots [, but , uh ,] my mind _has_ [gone] blank . i've been [all] evening how [they] develop [, uh _,] what_ [the] [candidate] stands [for] 
A|66| A: [uh-huh ,] 
B|67| B: [you know _,] the_ views [, and] [, uh [,] you know ,] everybody gets [to] [vote] _on_ [, you know [,] well ,] [should] [he] [be] [for] this [and] _on_ [and] _on_ [and] _on_ [, and] [, uh [,] it's] [, it's] interesting . 
A|68| A: [yeah _,] that would_ [be _.] i_ [usually] [vote .] [a lot of] times _i'll vote_ [a] straight [party] ticket [just] _because [i_ don't] take _the [time_ _to] find_ _out_ [what] every [, you know ,] [other] than [the] major candidates [, what] [they] stand [for] [on] [what] issues , 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [so] _i'll_ [just] trust [well [,] _the] party_ kind [of] [goes] along these [lines] [so] _i'll_ [go] ahead [and [vote] .] 
B|71| B: [right .] there [for] [a] while [, that would] [, that] worked . we've [, uh [,] i] [know] [i] [have ,] um , [i'll] stick [to] [uh _,] to_ [the] [, you know ,] [sometimes] [i'll] stick [to] [a] certain [party] , depends [on] [the] [guy] . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [but , uh [,] [if] [it] [,] uh ,] gets down between two , then [i'll] , [i'll vote] [for [the] party] [because i] [know [,] you know ,] [something] _about the_ [other] [guy] 
A|74| A: [yeah .] 
B|75| B: [or] [, you know ,] [they're] both [just] as bad [, and] [i'll] say [, _well ,] i_ [know what] this [guy] stands [for] as far as [for] his [party] [, and] , um [, but] [yeah .] [you know [,] that's] [not] [the] _best_ way [but ,] 
A|76| A: _no [,_ i] guess it'd [be] [best] [if you] knew each person [and] [what] [they] stood [for] [and] [why] [and] [everything] . 
B|77| B: [but] [it] gets [to] [the] point [where] [, i] mean [, you've got] [to] [have] [the] [find] [the time] [also] [to] _read_ _about the_ [guy] [and] [, and] [be] able [to find] [the] information [about] [what] [he] stands [for] . 
A|78| A: [right , and] try [to] determine [if] [what] [you] [read] [was] objective [or] [not] . 
B|79| B: [right , or] [what] [you've] heard [on] t v , which [i think] [is] [just] outrageous . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: [i] [, [i] don't] agree [with] how [the] media handles elections . 
A|82| A: [yeah .] 
B|83| B: [i] [, you know [,] i'm] tired [of] hearing _about the polls_ [, you know [,] you know ,] this [is] how [he] stands [such] [and] [such a] day [the] way [they] break [it] [out] , 
A|84| A: [yeah .] 
B|85| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
A|86| A: [yeah , [i think] it could] affect _the outcome_ [, you know ,] [could make] [it] unfair . 
B|87| B: [uh-huh [,] [it] really] [could] [, and] [, uh ,] then , how , [sometimes] , how [the] media [will] blow things [out] [of] proportion [and] [will] run an issue _into_ [the] ground which [is] [good] [and] dead [, and] [they] keep dragging [it] [on] [, and] [it could] hamper [the outcome] [of] an [election] [for the] [guy] [that] [should] [have] won . 
A|88| A: [oh , yeah .] 
B|89| B: [yeah ,] [so [,] uh ,] 
A|90| A: [yeah [,] _the] press_ [has] [a lot of] power . 
B|91| B: [they] [really] [do] [. i] [, i] [sometimes] [think that] [that] [should] [be] limited [more] . 
A|92| A: [yeah [,] [oh] [,] but ,] boy [you] try [get into] [that ,] you'd [really] [open] [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|93| B: [oh ,] yes [, or] [they] [, i] agree [with] [the] freedom [of [the] press] [, you know [,] [and] all] [the] amendments [, but] [sometimes] [it's] [for the] public's own [good] [that] we [don't] hear things . 
A|94| A: [yeah ,] [seems [that] [they] should] regulate themselves [a] little bit [, and [i] don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|95| B: [no ,] [they don't] . 
A|96| A: [well , i] can't [think] [of] anything else [really] [about the polls] [or] [voting] [, to] talk [about] . 
B|97| B: [well , i] enjoyed _talking to you ._ 
A|98| A: [well [,] [it] was] [good] [talking to you .] 
B|99| B: [all] [right .]
