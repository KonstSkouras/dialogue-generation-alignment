A|0| A: _well_ _i_ don't _know_ if _there's_ going _to_ be solutions _to_ _the_ u s budget . 
B|1| B: [well] _now_ _it's_ _in_ pretty disastrous shape _for_ _sure ._ 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _it's_ _only_ _getting_ worse exponentially _it_ seems . 
A|4| A: yes . exactly . 
B|5| B: _um_ 
A|6| A: _there's_ _uh_ _maybe_ some short-term things _that_ they can do _and_ [it] hurts everybody's pocket _of_ course _but_ [um] _i_ _know_ _that_ _state_ has _uh_ cutback _uh_ raises [for] _a_ year _to_ help _uh_ _the_ _uh_ _state_ financial _or whatever_ _you_ might want _to_ say _to_ get better [in] _a_ better condition . 
B|7| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|8| A: _that_ 
B|9| B: oh which [state] _is_ [that] ? 
A|10| A: _uh_ [state] _of_ minnesota . 
B|11| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: so _there's_ _the_ potential [that] perhaps _you know_ _the_ u s budget might want _to_ take _a_ _look at_ [it's] _uh_ federal employees _or_ _and_ take _a_ _look at_ saying [well] let's freeze wages . _i mean_ everybody's doing [it] so [it] isn't _like_ _uh_ private business has had _to_ do [it] 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: so [it] might _have_ _to_ be _something_ [that] they might consider doing as _a_ _that's_ got _to_ be very short term . 
B|15| B: right . right . 
A|16| A: _and_ _the_ [only] other avenue [that] _i_ can _think_ _of_ [is] _uh_ looking _at_ where they're spending _the_ _money_ _and_ _not_ so _much_ as saying [well] we're spending _too_ _much_ [in] [that] area as perhaps looking _at_ what [is] costing them _the_ _money_ . as [for] [for] instance _i think_ _you_ _probably_ remember _the_ military [getting] caught [um] with toilet seats [that] _cost_ them four hundred five hundred _dollars_ . 
B|17| B: yep . right . 
A|18| A: _and_ _it was_ just _i mean_ _you_ can go _to_ k-mart _and_ _buy_ them [for] _uh_ eight _dollars_ _or_ _i think_ six _dollars_ _or whatever_ [for] toilet seats 
B|19| B: yeah . 
A|20| A: so . so [it] gives _you_ idea [that] 
B|21| B: yeah . definitely [i think] [that] [there's] [probably] _a lot of_ waste [in] defense [and] [in] _government_ funded research [in] [the] first place . 
A|22| A: [sure] [sure .] so 
B|23| B: [i mean] _there was_ [um] _people_ [at] stanford who _were_ soaking _the government_ [you know] _using_ millions [of] [dollars] [of] research [money] [to] [uh] [for] [the] president [to] [buy] beach homes [or whatever] [it was] . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|25| B: _and [i_ think] [that] [that] [maybe] _more_ widespread _than_ [well] _than_ we'd [like] [to] [have] _think ._ 
A|26| A: [than] we [think .] [sure .] [sure .] 
B|27| B: [but] [but] _then_ [it's] [something] [that's] hard [to] enforce [too] _i'm [sure_ .] 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] [it] [sure] [is] . [the] [you know] as far as [i think] [there was] [something] with [the government] official [that] went on conferences [for] two days [and] actually [uh] [the] conferences [were] nothing [but] [uh] [you know] they're [getting] paid [for] this [and] [it was] [something] [more] [than] just [the] conferences . they [were] [using] [it] as eating out [uh] _when you_ [think] _about_ [people] [uh] taking vacations these big [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [the] rest [of] them taking these vacations [and] [using] [the] taxpayers' [money] [for] [that] . 
B|31| B: right . 
A|32| A: [and] [it's] [a] real big crunch [uh] 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [of] course _when_ they get caught [then] they're [you know] they're guilty [of] course [but] [uh] during [that] time [i'm sure] [there's] hundreds [of] [uh] thousands [of] [people] [that] are [uh] spending [money] [that] does _not_ belong [to] them . so 
B|35| B: [well] [that's] right . [uh] [i think] [that] oh politicians talk _a lot_ [about] waste 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [but] [i'm] [not] [sure] _that that's_ really [that] [much] [of] [the] problem . 
A|38| A: [sure .] 
B|39| B: [i mean] [when you] [look at] [something] [like] [the] gulf _war_ [it] [cost] us god knows how [much] . [you know] [at] [a] million [dollars] [a] pop [for] patriot missiles . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] exactly . [and i] don't [think] [uh] [it's] ended up being [i mean] [it] gave [people] jobs 
B|41| B: yeah . 
A|42| A: [but] [i think] [it] also [cost] [um] quite [a] bit as far as because after they're done with [the] [war] [a lot of] things [were] no longer put [to] use . [i mean] [it was] kind [of] [like] _okay_ we'll do this during this point [and] time [but] after [that that's] [you know] [uh] they didn't want [to] do [it] anymore . 
B|43| B: right [. uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: so [a lot of] things [that] are saying [that] they're no longer going [to] be doing [for] next wars [that] are coming up [that] they did [for] this one [in] [getting] rid [of] [a lot of] things . so [i] don't [know] . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] right . 
A|46| A: _okay_ [well] [it was] good talking [to] [you] [and] [have] [a] good evening . 
B|47| B: [okay] all right . [you] [too] . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh] thanks . 
B|49| B: bye-bye .
