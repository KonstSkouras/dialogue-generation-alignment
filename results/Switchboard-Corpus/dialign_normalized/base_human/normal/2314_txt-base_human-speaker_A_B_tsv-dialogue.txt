A|0| A: _well_ _i _i_ don't_ _think that_ _it's_ _it's_ wrong _for_ _a company_ _to_ require _drug_ _testing_ _for_ certain types _of_ positions . _for instance_ _jobs_ _that_ require use _of_ heavy machinery _and things like that_ _where_ there's _where_ there's _uh_ endangerment _to_ _their_ own life _and_ _other_ people's lives . 
B|1| B: [uh] [i] agree _with that_ . _people_ _that are_ [uh] driving [like] [uh] truck drivers [and things like that] . 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: [i] definitely _think they_ should _be_ _tested_ . [and] i'm _not_ i'm _not_ opposed [to] _any_ [testing] _. _i_ mean_ _because i know_ [i] certainly wouldn't want [to] [to] _uh you know_ _be_ endangered _by_ somebody _in_ [a company] [that] accidentally dropped _something_ _on_ _me_ _or_ _or_ _you know_ _because_ he _was_ _on_ _drugs_ _while_ he _was_ _there_ . 
A|4| A: _yeah ._ 
B|5| B: [uh] ... 
A|6| A: _well_ _how do you_ _how do _you_ feel_ about [uh] _companies_ _drug_ [testing] prior [to] hiring ? 
B|7| B: oh [uh] _i was_ _tested uh_ within _my company_ _. _i_ think_ [it's] kind [of] [a] push [to] [uh] weed _out_ _drugs_ _in_ states [and] _because _i_ don't know_ [of] _any_ [other] countries _that are_ doing this 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: [and] [i i] _feel like_ [it's] really _just_ within _the_ united states . [it's] [uh] [it's] _okay _._ _i_ think_ _your_ _record_ should stand [for] itself . _that _you_ _know_ if_ you've been _tested_ _at_ [other] [companies] [and] you've always come up negative _or_ whatever _then_ [i don't] _see_ _what the_ big deal _is_ _that _they_ _have_ to_ go [to] _all_ _the_ expense [of] _testing you_ over [and] over [and] over . 
A|10| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: [and] _once_ you've established _the_ fact [that] _you're_ _not_ _a drug user_ [and] _especially_ _if_ _your_ personality proves [that] _you're_ _not_ _. _i_ _think_ they_ could [uh] save money _by_ _not_ doing [that] . _you know_ _every_ _time_ _say_ _if_ [you] change [jobs] [you] wouldn't _have to do_ _it_ _if_ you'd _just_ been _tested_ _at_ _your_ [other] _work_ place . 
A|12| A: _well_ [what] about _random_ [testing] though . 
B|13| B: oh . 
A|14| A: _do _you_ [feel_ like] _that's_ _an_ invasion [of] certain people's rights [if] [not] everyone [is] [tested] ? 
B|15| B: _uh not_ _if it's_ _done fairly_ . _and that's_ probably _my_ question [is] [how] [how do _you] know_ [it's] _done fairly_ . 
A|16| A: [i don't _know] [that_ you] [do] . [if _it's] random_ [then] _it's random_ 
B|17| B: [yeah .] 
A|18| A: [and that's] [not] necessarily fair . 
B|19| B: [well] _they_ _might_ tell [you] [it's _random] ._ 
A|20| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|21| B: _but_ [then] _you know_ [it's] kind [of] [like] [a] [a] lottery . somebody _in_ [their] lifetime may win millions [of] dollars [where] _another_ person _doesn't_ win anything [and] tries [and] tries [and] tries . _you know ._ 
A|22| A: [yeah _.] well_ [i [i] _know] that_ _for instance_ _in the_ n c double [a] [they] [drug] test [and] [it's] [not] [random .] 
B|23| B: oh [i] _see_ . how'd [how] did [they] [how do] [they] pick [their] _people_ ? 
A|24| A: [uh] [well] [i think] [all] college players [have to do] _an_ initial [drug] test [at] [a] certain point prior [to] [the] season 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [and] from [that] point [on] [uh] [at] [the] n c double [a] _does_ [have] [something] [to do] [with] [it] [but] [it's] _almost_ discretionary [on] [the] coach's part [of] each individual institution [to] identify [the] ones _that _have_ the_ problem . 
B|27| B: oh [i] _see_ . _so_ [do you] ... 
A|28| A: [and] _and the_ ones [that] test positive [have to] retest after [a] certain period [of] [time] . 
B|29| B: _right_ [. well] [do you] [think that] should _be_ implemented [in the] _work_ place . _you know_ _as_ [like] [a] _manager_ _or_ supervisor thinks _or_ _has_ suspicion _that someone_ [is] using _drugs_ [do you] _think they_ should [have the] _right_ [to] send _them to_ _be_ [tested] . 
A|30| A: [well] [not] being [a drug user] [i don't] [have] [a] problem [with that] _personally_ 
B|31| B: _right_ . 
A|32| A: [but] [i [think] that] [might] [be] [a] violation [of] someone's rights . [if] someone's having personal problems _for some reason_ [that's] causing [them to] behave differently 
B|33| B: _right_ . 
A|34| A: [and] [their] [manager] assumes [they have] [a drug] problem [i mean] [if] [someone] assumed [that] [of] [me] [i] _would_ [be] upset . 
B|35| B: _right_ _right_ . [yeah] [it] [it] [would] [almost] [be] [like] [a] [a] [uh] ... 
A|36| A: [it's] _an_ accusation [and] [and] [it's] [and] [it's] based [on] [on] [a] perception [that someone] [has] [as] [how] [a drug user] [would] behave _when_ _some_ [drug] users behave [uh] normal [uh [you know] .] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] [and] [then] [how] [would] [you feel] afterwards [when] [you] came up negative [and] [you know] _your_ supervisor [has] accused [you] [of] using _drugs ._ 
A|38| A: [right] exactly [. [i] [i] don't] [the] [i think] [almost] [the] only way [that] [drug] [testing] can [be] [done fairly] [is] [if it's] across [the] board from from [the] janitors [to] [the] executive management . 
B|39| B: [right] [. i] agree [with that] . _because i know_ [personally] myself i've been [in the] same _job_ [for] _three_ years [it] will [be] _three_ years [in] august [and] i've already been _drug tested_ _three_ times . 
A|40| A: [what] type [of] [job] [do you] [have] ? 
B|41| B: [well] i'm [an] environmental engineer 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [and] i've been _drug tested_ _three_ times [and] [i know] many _people_ [that have] never been [tested] [in] [their] lifetime [and the] [company] [i] _work for_ [is] sixty thousand _people_ plus . _so_ _see_ [i] [for some reason] i've come up _three_ times . [that's] pretty high statistics . 
A|44| A: _well does your_ _does your_ [job] require [you] [to] drive [company] equipment [or] [to] operate [any] type [of] machinery [that] [might] endanger [someone] ? 
B|45| B: _no_ . _no_ [not] [at] [all] . 
A|46| A: [well] [that] [doesn't] [i mean] [i] ... 
B|47| B: _it's a_ legal [job] [you know] 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: _so_ _see_ [it's] really strange . 
A|50| A: [that] [is] odd [. [i] was] [drug [tested] [uh] not] [for] [the] [job] [i] [have] now [but] [for] [the] prior [job] [uh] [but] [i _know] [that_ they] sent [that] [the] [job] [i] had _before_ [that] [well] [the] [job] [i] [have] [have] now requested [my] [uh] [uh] [my] [uh] medical [record] from [my] old [company] 
B|51| B: oh [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [so] [i don't [know] if] [i] wasn't [drug tested] based [on] [that] [or] [because] [the] man who hired [me] didn't request [the] [drug] test [because i _know] that_ [my company] _does_ [drug] [testing] [on] occasion . 
B|53| B: [right] [. [well] does your] [the] [company] _say_ [for instance] [does] [the] [company] [you] worked [for] [before] [have the] [right] [or] [do] [they [have] the] ability [to] _say_ hey we've already [drug tested] her [and] she came up negative . 
A|54| A: [well] [no] [i don't] [think they] can [they] can force [another] [company] [to] [not] [drug] test [me] [just] [by] saying [that] [i i] didn't [i mean] 
B|55| B: [yeah .] 
A|56| A: [they] [don't _know] that_ [i don't] use [drugs .] [they] [just] [tested] [me] [once] . 
B|57| B: [right] [right] . 
A|58| A: [but] [i] used [to] [work for] [a] power [company] [so] [it] [was] very important [that they] make sure [their] employees [especially] linemen [uh] were clean . 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [and] since [i was] [just] [you know] one [of] [the] office folk [i] guess [it] wasn't [as] important [to] [them] [that they] test [me] regularly . [but] [i know] [they] test most [of] [the] service [people] [fairly] regularly [uh] [just] across [the] board . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] [and] _are_ [they] [tested] [random] ? 
A|62| A: [no] _they're_ [all] [of] [them] [are] [tested] [once] [every] [three] 
B|63| B: [they're] ... 
A|64| A: [it's a] rotation . 
B|65| B: oh _okay [._ i] _see_ . 
A|66| A: [but] [it] [but] again [it] depends [on] [what] [job] [you're] [in] . 
B|67| B: [yeah .] 
A|68| A: [the] men [that are] [out] [there] fixing power lines [are] [tested] [a] lot [and the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with] [with] [the] guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't [tested] [as] much . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [but] [but] [see] [they] make [that] clear [to] [them] [as] [they] hire those guys [what] [what the] [drug] [testing] schedule [is] . 
B|71| B: oh [i] [see] . 
A|72| A: [they] [say] we we're [testing you] tomorrow [and] we'll test [you] [every] [three] months thereafter [while] [you] [work] here . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] _okay_ [so] [they] [know that] . [and that's] ... 
A|74| A: [yeah] [it's] [it's] made very clear upon hiring . 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] _okay [._ well] ... 
A|76| A: [well] [have] we spent our [at] least five minutes ? 
B|77| B: [yeah] 
A|78| A: [okay .] 
B|79| B: [i think] [so] . [yeah] seven twenty-five . 
A|80| A: [okay .]
