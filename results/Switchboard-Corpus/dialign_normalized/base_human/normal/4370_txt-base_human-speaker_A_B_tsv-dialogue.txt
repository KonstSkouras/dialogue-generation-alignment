A|0| A: actually _to_ tell _you_ _the_ truth _i think_ _uh_ _jury selection_ _is_ _a_ _uh_ prime _uh_ discussion topic _in_ terms _of_ possible _improvements_ _on_ _uh_ _uh_ finding _of_ _uh_ guilt . 
B|1| B: [uh] [i] certainly can't argue with _that ._ definitely does need _some_ [improvements] . [uh] _and_ [the] lawyers _can_ throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they _want_ [to] . 
A|2| A: _yeah_ _i think_ there's _a_ limit _on_ [that .] _the uh _the_ uh_ peremptory challenges _are_ limited [to] _i don't know_ how _many_ 
B|3| B: [i think] it's four _or_ five 
A|4| A: _but_ _you_ [can] 
B|5| B: [i] can't remember which _. i_ was [on] [a] [jury] _trial_ last year only [i] got kicked out as [uh the] last [selection] [that] [the uh] defense got . 
A|6| A: _um ._ _yeah_ _it_ seems [to] me _i'm_ _always_ challenged peremptorily _also_ _when_ [i] go [to] these _things [._ [i] think] [i] _have_ [a] _severe_ demeanor [or] something . 
B|7| B: [um .] 
A|8| A: [uh] 
B|9| B: [that] [uh] 
A|10| A: _but_ typically _you_ _know_ [uh] typically [uh] everyone gets involved _in_ [uh _the] jury_ _process_ _and i_ suppose _an_ elitist might _say_ _well_ _you_ really [want] someone _who_ _is_ _well_ _educated_ _to be_ able [to] [to] winnow _the facts_ from [the] from [the] prejudice . 
B|11| B: _right_ [but] [it] still has [to be] [a] group [of] your peers . 
A|12| A: _right ._ 
B|13| B: see . 
A|14| A: _so_ 
B|15| B: _so if_ it's your peers [and] _you're_ not [educated] _then_ 
A|16| A: [so if] [you're] _a nincompoop_ [on] [trial] you'd you'd _have_ [to] _have_ nincompoops _to uh_ 
B|17| B: [you] [want] [you] [want] [a nincompoop] [jury] because they'll sympathize with [you] [a] bit as [well] as hopefully being honest people [and] do their best [to] comply with [the facts] as they were presented [to] _them ._ 
A|18| A: [um .] 
B|19| B: [so] that's why [the] defense [is] _there_ picking through _them_ whereas at [the] same time [the uh the] prosecutor sitting _there_ picking through _them_ because he wants somebody [who] will give him [uh] [a] guilty verdict [if] [the facts] warrant . 
A|20| A: uh-huh . 
B|21| B: [so] [uh] [i think] [the [jury] selection] [process] [is] pretty neat [but] [i don't] [think] [that] [the jury] ought [to be] [the] ones picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
A|22| A: [um .] 
B|23| B: [i think] [that] should [be] left up [to] people [who] [have] _some_ knowledge [in] [the] subject [and] more knowledge than [a] [jury] would [have] . [you're] talking _about_ [the] person's already been found guilty [right] 
A|24| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|25| B: [and] [many] times _i've_ seen [on] trials they [have] [on] t v [the jury] will make [a] recommendation as [to] leniency [or] as [to] [the] death penalty [or] whatever [but] [i think] [that] [it] should [be] up [to] [the] judge [and] [the uh] lawyers [to] make [the] decision as [to] _what_ [the] actual penalty will [be] . 
A|26| A: [um .] 
B|27| B: maybe just [the] judge because they're [the] people [who] [know] _what_ [the] system [is] [and] _what_ it's all _about_ [and] believe [in] [the] system . 
A|28| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|29| B: [uh] [and [i] think] [that] would provide [a] more fair sentencing procedure . as opposed [to] [an] emotional sentencing procedure . [also] _may be_ [a] more consistent sentencing procedure . 
A|30| A: [well] [i] suppose [you] [may be] [right] [on] [that .] matter [of] fact [i've] heard [that] [i've] heard [that] [some] [of] [the] information [uh] [is] prevented from reaching [the jury] _like_ [uh] mitigating circumstances [or] [or] _preceding_ [uh] _criminal record_ [or] _things_ [of] this nature [that] 
B|31| B: [well] [preceding] [criminal record] according [to] [the] judicial [process] has nothing [to] do with [the] current crime . [but] [when] [it] comes [to uh] sentencing for punishment [of] course [if] [the] person's never done anything bad before according [to] [the] judicial system _then_ they're going [to] lean towards [a] slightly more lenient side [and] [the] jury's supposed [to be] notified [of] [criminal] records [when] [it] comes [to] sentencing by [jury] . 
A|32| A: oh [is] [it] ? oh [i] didn't realize [that .] okay . 
B|33| B: at least [in] california they're supposed [to be] . not during [the] [trial] during [the] [trial] as [to] whether they're guilty [or] not has nothing [to] do with their background . 
A|34| A: _right ._ 
B|35| B: [but] [when] [it] comes [to] _what_ kind [of] sentence [you're] going [to] lay down [i think] [that] [uh] [that] they should . 
A|36| A: uh-huh . 
B|37| B: [i don't] [i don't know] [that] they [always] [have] because [i] never sat all [the] way through [a] [jury] [trial] . they get too boring . 
A|38| A: uh-huh . _so you_ [what] [you're] saying [is] this [if] [there] [is] [the] _second offense_ [then] [you] execute [them .] 
B|39| B: [well] [if] it's [a] [second offense] [the] punishment should certainly [be] more [severe] than [a] first [offense] because obviously [the] rehabilitation [process] did not work [the] first time . 
A|40| A: [um .] 
B|41| B: [so you] got [to] give [them] either more time [in] [the] system [or] [a] different [process] [that] will hopefully work better . [when] [it] comes down [to] [things] [like] alternative sentencing [i'm] all for [that] for [uh] small _crimes_ infractions [and] misdemeanors [or] parking tickets [or] traffic tickets [that] [have] gone [to] warrant [you] give [them] [the] option [of] working off their time doing civil service sort [of] [things .] 
A|42| A: [what] [about] [uh] white collar [crimes] [like] [uh] theft [of] trade secrets . 
B|43| B: [i think] those ought [to be] punished [a] whole lot worse than they [are] . 
A|44| A: oh really ? 
B|45| B: [yeah] . 
A|46| A: [like] [what] ? 
B|47| B: [well] [uh] [say] embezzlement [right .] [you] get [a] guy down [the] street [who] comes up [uh] carrying [a]
