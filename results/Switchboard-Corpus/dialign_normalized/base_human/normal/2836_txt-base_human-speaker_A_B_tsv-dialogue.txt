A|0| A: okay _. uh_ far as _you know_ _crime_ _in the_ cities _i'm_ sure _like_ _in_ yours _it's_ pretty pretty _bad _._ uh_ _probably the_ biggest _thing_ we've got _going_ _now_ _is_ _the_ robberies _and_ theft _and_ _probably_ murder _are_ _the_ two top ones _that_ _we_ _have_ . 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _how_ _about you_ ? 
B|3| B: [uh] _well_ _i_ _don't_ _actually_ _live [in_ _the] city_ _but_ _i'd_ [probably] _say that's_ roughly _right _._ _i_ mean_ _crimes_ against property seem _to_ outnumber _crimes_ against _life_ _but_ _i _i_ think_ _with_ [the] current war _on_ _drugs_ _and all_ this kind _of stuff_ _i'd_ _say [probably_ _the] police_ department _would_ claim [the] number _one_ _crimes_ _crimes_ [are] [probably] solicitation _of_ prostitution _uh and_ sale _of_ _drugs_ . 
A|4| A: [uh-huh .] [probably] [right] _if you_ look at _it_ _from_ _that_ stand point . 
B|5| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|6| A: _what_ [uh] _is_ _there_ anything [uh] _that you_ particularly [are] concerned [with] [in] your particular area as far as security _and _that_ _sort of_ thing_ ? 
B|7| B: [uh] _where_ _i live_ [now] [it's] _it's not_ _so_ [bad _.] _i_ mean_ _i_ _can_ _basically_ leave _my_ front door unlocked [and] _not_ _have to_ worry [about] [it] [. _uh] but_ _i_ _do_ [have] friends [that] _live [in_ _the] city_ _and _i_ think _that_ they_ _get _a_ lot of_ fallout [from] this war _on_ drug [thing] [. _uh] just_ _because_ [there] [are] [like] crack houses [you know] _on_ _their_ street [and] _stuff_ [like] this . 
A|8| A: [uh-huh .] _do you_ [live in] [a] _real_ small town _or_ _or_ _out in the country_ ? 
B|9| B: _i live_ [out in the country] _yeah ._ 
A|10| A: _how_ far [out] [from] [the city] [i mean] _do you_ 
B|11| B: [i'm] _about fifteen miles_ [out] . 
A|12| A: [about fifteen miles] [. [i] [live] in] _a little_ suburb [uh] which _is_ [i] guess [from] dallas _is_ twelve [miles] _or_ [so] 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [but] [it's] pretty congested . _we_ [are] considered [in the country] 
B|15| B: um . 
A|16| A: [but] [it] doesn't really feel [like] _you're_ [in the country] . 
B|17| B: um . 
A|18| A: _our_ major _crimes _in_ our_ immediate town [uh] _is_ [probably] robberies house robberies [and] very few instances [of] [you know] alcohol [drugs] [uh] reported . 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: however [i'm] sure _they're_ [there] . 
B|21| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: [but] [uh] [right] [now] _our_ neighborhood _is_ running [about] [uh] eighty percent _of the_ homeowners _have been_ robbed sometime during [their] [their] [uh] existence [in] [that] neighborhood . 
B|23| B: wow . _that's_ huge . 
A|24| A: [and] since [that] _time_ everybody's got some _sort of_ burglar _system_ _or_ [you know] [uh] burglar alarms [uh and] including [the] [out] [uh] [the] outer perimeter type [uh] devices sensors [and] _things_ [like] [that] . 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [it's] cut back [you know] considerably [but] [it] [it] [just] shifts [it] [from] _our_ neighborhood [to] another neighborhood [to] _other_ neighborhood [so] [it] _still_ [uh] remains [city] wide pretty pretty high . 
B|27| B: [are] [there] [are] [there] _any_ theories _on_ why this [is] _happening_ ? 
A|28| A: [uh] _i would_ [say] [the] majority [of] [it's] [happening] during [the] day [uh] between [probably] ten [in the] morning [and] three [in the] afternoon . 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: most 
B|31| B: [but] why ? why [is] [it] [happening] ? 
A|32| A: [well] most families most families [are] young [and] both _people are_ working . 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _so they're_ [happening] during [the] hours _they're_ gone [from] work . 
B|35| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [uh] [so] [uh] _i would_ [say that's] [probably] [their] prime motivation . they'll they'll stock your house [and] [uh] look at your pattern [and] then go [from] [there] . 
B|37| B: [so they're] _professionals_ ? 
A|38| A: [uh] [they] classify most [of] _them_ as [professionals] . 
B|39| B: um . 
A|40| A: [uh] [you] [get a] few [of] _them_ [that] [are] _a little bit_ sloppier [uh just] taking [uh] [you know] [just] junk items [that they] [they] [can] [just] [get] [you know] ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ _real_ quick . 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [probably the] biggest items [that] [uh] _that you_ [get] _in our_ neighborhood _or_ _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles [the] [you know] mercedes volvos _things [that_ they] [can] [get] [you know] _big_ dollars _for_ [and] [the] jewelry [are] [the] major targets 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: guns _that sort [of_ stuff] . 
B|45| B: um . 
A|46| A: very few [you know] penny penny ante [stuff] . 
B|47| B: [well] [what] [do you] _think_ [can] [be] done [to] reduce [that sort of] [crime] ? 
A|48| A: [well] [uh] [the police] force _for_ [one] [i think] [they] _could_ [uh] definitely add [to] [the police] force [and] [the] type equipment [that they] use [. uh] [it's] _oh_ [right] [now] [i think] _we_ [are] [about] thirty thousand _people_ [and] _there's_ only eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty _for_ [that] amount [of] _people_ which [is] [not] very many . 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] _right ._ 
A|50| A: [and] 
B|51| B: [but] _i mean that's_ [going] [to] tend [to] [i mean] [it] seems [to] me [that sort of] approach _will_ tend [to] simply _make_ [the] cost [of] committing [the] [crime] slightly higher [in] [other] words you've increased [the] probability [of] _somebody_ being _caught_ [a little bit] . [the] [real] question [is] [how] [do you] convince [people] [not] [to] commit such [crimes [in] the] first place . 
A|52| A: [well] [the] course _in our_ particular _state_ [uh] _we_ [have] [the] _prison_ overcrowding whatever [so they're] giving [the] early release [uh] 
B|53| B: _right ._ [they're] doing [that] [in our] [state] too . 
A|54| A: [yeah] _and and_ [it's] [i think] [what] [they] need [to] _do is_ stop building more jails [and] start giving stiffer sentences [uh but] _for the_ 
B|55| B: _so you_ _think _that_ _would _be_ a_ deterrent_ ? 
A|56| A: [that would be] certainly [be a deterrent] . 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [and] [uh] [not] necessarily [you know] _give_ [in] [to] [their] [uh] human _rights_ desires _. you know_ _if_ [they're] overcrowded [just] keep cramming _them_ [in] [there] till [they] [just] suffocate [. uh] 
B|59| B: [well] [what] [about] an innocent person _who_ happens [to] [have been] found _guilty_ ? 
A|60| A: [uh] [i think] they'd [have to] go [to] extra measures [to] [make] sure [a] person's [guilty] [you know] [in] [a lot of] cases . course [i _i] know_ [you] can't [be a] hundred percent foolproof . 
B|61| B: _right ._ 
A|62| A: [uh] 
B|63| B: [so] you'd you'd _rather see it_ _harder_ _to convict somebody_ . 
A|64| A: [i'd] [rather see it] [a little bit] [harder] [and] [have] [a little bit] more evidence [uh] [to convict somebody] 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [and] then _those_ convicted especially [of] [you know] murder _and and_ [uh] [you know] major [crimes] [uh] [to] reach [the] [life] sentences [and] [you know] death penalties [and] follow-through [with] [that] . 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] huh . 
A|68| A: [uh] especially [you know] [in the] case [of] murder 
B|69| B: _right ._ 
A|70| A: [uh] _i know_ [in] [my] case [i] [my] wife [and] daughter were kidnapped during [a] house robbery back [in] eighty-five 
B|71| B: [oh] wow . [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|72| A: [and] _we_ [caught] [the] individuals got [caught] _we_ [uh] _we_ went through [the] court _system_ [and all] [that _sort of] thing_ 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [and] [uh] [you know] two counts [of] kidnapping [uh] [you know] [the] [the] forty-five [to] [the] head [you know] [just] [the] [the] _mental anguish_ [and] [the] whole nine yards [uh] [you know] _the guy_ only got five years . 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] _right ._ wow . 
A|76| A: [and] [you know] he was [out] within two months [because] _of the_ parole _system_ . [so] [what] [what] 
B|77| B: did [you] did [you] sue _him_ under [the] civil [system] ? 
A|78| A: [do] [what] [now] ? 
B|79| B: did [you] sue _him_ under [the] civil [system] ? 
A|80| A: _no_ . [i'm] [not] [real] familiar [with] [that] . 
B|81| B: _well _you_ could_ [probably] sue _him_ [for] [mental anguish] [or] _something_ [right] [and] _try to_ [get] _money_ [from] _him_ 
A|82| A: [oh] . 
B|83| B: [and] 
A|84| A: [well] [the] insurance companies [and all] [that] tried [to] tried [to] go after [him] _and they_ said [well [you] know] he [they're] he has _no_ _job_ he has nothing _there's_ nothing [that] he has [that] _that [you_ could] go after . 
B|85| B: _yeah ._ makes [you] wish [that] _had_ [uh] [still] _had_ indentured servitude [for] this [sort of thing] . 
A|86| A: [yeah [.] uh] very 
B|87| B: _but they_ [give] [the guy] [a] [job] [in] [prison] [and] [make] [him] _pay_ his damn debt . 
A|88| A: [yeah .] [they] [don't] [do] [that] _here_ . course [they] [pay] _them_ [but they] [don't] [you] [don't] [you] [or] [the] insurance companies never [see] [any] [of] [that] [money] . 
B|89| B: _yeah that's_ too [bad .] 
A|90| A: [and] [uh] [you _know] and_ [they're] [right] [now] [they're] reluctant [to] go after [him] [because] [they're] [you know] [they're] [they're] repeat offenders [they] [uh] [been] [in] jail before 
B|91| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: they've [been] released [you know] several times which [is] another [uh] deal [i] hate _to see_ . 
B|93| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [but] [uh] [you know] [basically] [the guy] commits [you know] three major [crimes] _and and_ [uh and] car theft [on] top [of] [it] destroys [my] car 
B|95| B: _yeah [i_ [i] think] [that's] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
A|96| A: [and] _we're_ [out] [you know] [uh] [you know] [fifteen] thousand dollars [and] [you know] [the guy] gets [out in] two months 
B|97| B: [that's] awful 
A|98| A: [and] he goes [out] [and] commits [it] again . fact he's back [in] jail [now] . [so] [what] [what] [uh] 
B|99| B: gives [you] sympathy [for the] vigilantes . 
A|100| A: [yeah .] [what] [what] [deterrent] does he really [have] ? 
B|101| B: [yeah .] 
A|102| A: [yeah [i] think] [in our] [in our] particular neighborhood vigilantism [is] becoming [a] [real] [real] possibility . 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [uh] we've [had] [a] couple instances [where] _break_ ins [where] [the] [people] [have] [actually] [you know] _shot_ [the] [people] 
B|105| B: [oh] [my] god . 
A|106| A: [and] [uh] return offenders [have] they've [actually] waited [for] _them_ [where] they've robbed [you know] particular neighborhood they'll rob [one] house then [other] [people] [will] wait up [you _know] and_ wait [for] [somebody] [to] [do] [something] else [try to] take [it] [in] [their] own hands . 
B|107| B: _right ._ 
A|108| A: course [it] doesn't always work [out in] [their] favor . 
B|109| B: _right ._ 
A|110| A: [but] [uh] nevertheless [i think] _people are_ [just] _getting_ fed up [and] saying [you know] [you] can't arrest [all] [of] us 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: _you can_ [you know] _you can_ [get] some [of] us 
B|113| B: _right ._ 
A|114| A: [you] can't [get] [all] [of] us . 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [uh and] _we're_ beginning _to see_ more [and] more [of] [that] . 
B|117| B: [and that] [that's] [a deterrent] too . [if you] [think] [the] home owner might [be] armed [right] [and] awake 
A|118| A: [yeah .] 
B|119| B: [here] [you] [break] _in and_ [you're] [going] [to] [get] [shot] . 
A|120| A: [yeah that's] [i mean that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] [in] _we_ [have] [had] [a] few cases [where] [the guy] has broken [in] [you know] during [the] middle _of the_ night [and] gotten himself [shot] [to] death . 
B|121| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [and] [uh] [it] helps [for] [a] while 
B|123| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: [but] then [just] another different set [of] [people] come [in and] most _of the_ _people are_ transients [from] [out] outside _of the_ [state] . 
B|125| B: huh . 
A|126| A: [uh] _i would_ [say probably] eighty percent [of] _them_ [that] [are] [caught] [they're] [from] places [like] up [in] oklahoma [and] louisiana arkansas [you know] across [the] [the] border . 
B|127| B: wow 
A|128| A: [so [you] know] [people] [who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in our] town [or] whatever 
B|129| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|130| A: [it's not] many [from] [the] local communities . 
B|131| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|132| A: [but] [uh] [it's] [a] problem [and [i] i] [just] [i think that] [the] court systems need [to] [be] more accurate [in] [in] stiffer [in] [their] penalties 
B|133| B: [yeah .] 
A|134| A: [would be a] definite [deterrent] _and and_ [uh] giving [the] [uh] [police] [uh] agencies [a little bit] more jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] when [they] when [they] catch _these people_ . 
B|135| B: [yeah .] [uh-huh [.] [i] mean] [i i] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. [i] think] [uh] [what] [i would] [like] [to see] [is] number [one] completely [getting] rid [of] [these] victimless [crimes] [. uh] [there's] [no] reason [to] enforce [those] [and] spend [time] [and] [money] doing [it] [and and] worry [about] [these] [things] [where] [people are] [getting] hurt . 
A|136| A: [right .] 
B|137| B: [and [i] think] [one] [of the] [big] [things [that] [you] can] [do is] [to] increase deterrence [is] [uh] [if] someone [is] found [guilty] [of] [a] [uh] felony level offense [they] lose [their] citizenship . [and they] lose [their] constitutional [rights] [. you know] 
A|138| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|139| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] [things that] [we're] trying [to] worry [about [you] know] protecting [these people] [from] [we] [just] [don't] protect [them] . 
A|140| A: _i know_ [like] [in] [my] wife's case [they] made her feel [like] [the] criminal . 
B|141| B: [i [know] [and] [i] think] [i think] [that's] ridiculous . 
A|142| A: [they] [they] went [to] [all] [all] ...
