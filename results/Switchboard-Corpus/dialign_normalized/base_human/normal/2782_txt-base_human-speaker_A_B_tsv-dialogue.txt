A|0| A: ready _to_ talk ? 
B|1| B: _i_ guess _so_ 
A|2| A: _okay ._ 
B|3| B: [okay .] 
A|4| A: _uh , i_ _want to_ talk _about_ _, um ,_ _our_ family _budget_ _, and_ _the_ _times_ _that it's_ _worked_ _and_ _the_ _times_ _that_ _it_ hasn't _worked_ _and ,_ give _you_ _a_ general description _of_ _it_ 
B|5| B: [okay .] yeah . 
A|6| A: bit . tell me _how_ yours works _. well _,_ at the_ [i] introduced _you_ _a little_ bit _to_ _it _,_ a_ few minutes ago _, when_ [i] _said_ _that we_ _are_ _, uh ,_ _we're_ _on the_ east coast _now_ . 
B|7| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|8| A: _my husband_ _quit_ _a_ perfectly wonderful job _and_ _decided_ _that_ , _well _, we_ both_ _decided_ _we_ wanted _to_ move _to_ north carolina . 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: _and_ [so] naturally _we_ _put_ ourselves _, we_ looked _at_ _our budget_ , 
B|11| B: yeah . 
A|12| A: _and_ _so ,_ _what_ _we did_ _was_ draw _up_ _a_ _budget_ _that we_ thought _, uh ,_ _was_ _realistic_ . 
B|13| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: _and , uh _,_ _so ,_ we_ had _to make_ _some_ adjustments _because _we_ _really_ are_ _kind of_ looking _for_ _something_ _that we want _to_ do_ _and_ _he_ wants _to do_ _that's_ satisfactory _, and_ _we've been_ here seven _months_ _and_ he's still hasn't hit _up_ _on anything_ permanently . 
B|15| B: _oh _, no_ ._ 
A|16| A: _so _,_ you_ _see ,_ 
B|17| B: [that] throws [the] [budget] _out of_ whack real fast . 
A|18| A: _well , we_ actually planned _for about_ _one year_ . 
B|19| B: _oh ,_ good . 
A|20| A: _uh _,_ that_ god _because_ , *listen _it_ _never_ occurred _to_ _it_ _never_ occurred _to_ _us_ [that] _it_ would take seven _months_ . 
B|21| B: [really] . [that] [was] smart . yeah . 
A|22| A: _and , uh ,_ _what_ _we did_ [was] _just _,_ uh ,_ decide _how_ _we_ had _been_ spending _our_ _money_ before , 
B|23| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|24| A: _and then we_ _put_ [that] _on the_ _computer_ _and then we_ took _about_ _three months_ _and , uh _,_ and_ adjusted , _where _we_ could_ _come_ _down_ _and_ _where _we_ didn't_ _want to_ _come_ _down_ , 
B|25| B: _oh _,_ uh-huh ._ yeah . 
A|26| A: _and we _really_ _,_ uh ,_ lessened _it _,_ uh ,_ _our_ living _expenses_ _, uh ,_ _more_ than _what_ _we_ thought _we_ would . 
B|27| B: wow , [that's] great . 
A|28| A: _but ,_ 
B|29| B: [did] _you _have_ a_ special program _on your_ [computer] [to do] [that] _or_ [was] this [just] _your_ _own design_ [of] , 
A|30| A: [oh ,] [just] _our_ [own design] . 
B|31| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: gosh . 
A|34| A: _and_ _the _,_ so _,_ but_ _we've_ had budgets [that] _didn't_ work _when_ _our _,_ uh _,_ you know _,_ of_ _our first_ fifteen _years_ [or] _eighteen years_ [of] being _married_ nothing _worked_ 
B|35| B: yeah 
A|36| A: _we_ spent _too_ _much_ _money_ , until _our_ children _went_ [to] _college_ _, so _._ so ,_ tell me _about_ , 
B|37| B: yeah . 
A|38| A: [do] [you] _all _,_ uh _,_ have a_ [budget] ? 
B|39| B: [well ,] [we've been] [married] [for] five _and a_ half [years] [and we] started _out_ without kids [, _of] course_ [, and] _found_ [it] [much] easier [to] _save and_ used [to do] [a] lot [more] fun kinds [of] [of] _things_ [and , uh ,] [did] [really [,] um [,] you know [,] have a] real strict [but ,] [budget] [but [,] uh _,] the_ [about] [and] [to] [our [,] when] [we] [first] got [married] _we were_ _in_ graduate _school_ [and _we] were_ [just [,] you know ,] dirt poor . [then] [when] [we] got [our first] jobs after [about] [a] [year] [of] marriage [we] [decided] we'd _bank_ [my] salary [so] [we could] buy [a] house [. [so ,] we] virtually [did] [that] [for about] _two_ _years ,_ which [worked] real [well [,] [and] then] moved from california [where we] realized [we could] [never] buy [a] house _anyway_ _no_ matter [how] [much] [we] saved [, and] moved [to] texas , bought [a] house immediately [, you know ,] which [, _of] course_ , _is_ [now] devalued with [the] housing market , 
A|40| A: wonderful . yes . 
B|41| B: [so [,] i] _don't_ [know] _if_ _we , [we_ did] [a] good thing [to] buy [a] house [or] _not_ [but] [at] least [we've] got [a] _place_ [to] live . [um [,] so ,] [now] , since [, _uh ,] we_ [have a] [three] _year old_ _and a two year old_ [now] [, um ,] 
A|42| A: [three] [and a two year old] . 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: bang , *one _utt_ ?? bang . 
B|45| B: [that's] , [that's] [, that] threw [our budget] [really] _out of_ whack [too] . _an_ _we [,_ um [,] have] [been] [just] forced _to budget_ [much] [more] [because] [i] [quit] working _to be_ _home_ with [the] kids . [and [,] um [,] we] [just] [really] [have] [, [uh ,] i] _don't_ [know _,] we ,_ [we've] tried different [times] , [we've] _done_ like [a] survey [of] like taking [, you know _,] the_ past [three months] [of] [where] [all] [the] [money] [went] . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and we really] _don't spend_ [on anything] [much] _of a_ luxury [or] [anything] [at] [all [,] but] [it] seems like _there's_ [, um ,] [times] [when] [we] [just] _have to_ get _out_ [where] _we'll_ go [and] like get [a] baby-sitter [and] _we'll_ go [and] _we'll_ blow [, you know ,] fifty , sixty _dollars_ _in_ [one] _night_ _going_ _out_ [to] eat , _going _to_ a_ show [or] doing [something] [, you know] . 
A|48| A: _well , i_ think [that's] important [for] [your] [budget] [to be] [for] [it] [to] work though [, [you] [have] [to] _do] something_ . 
B|49| B: "yeah , _that's the_ hard part [because] [when] [we] sit [down] [to make] [it [,] we] try [to make] [it] real spartan [and] real narrow [so] [we] _can_ [put] [a] certain amount _in_ savings every week [and then] [it's] _not_ [really] [that] [realistic] [because we] [do] find [that we want to] go [and] [do something] [or] splurge [for] [, you know ,] birthday [for] somebody [or] [, you know ,] even _we , we_ even [do] _things_ real frugally [for] [the] kids [, we] get [a] lot [of] toys [and] clothes [and] stuff [at] garage sales [or] from _friends_ [because] they _don't_ [know] [the] difference [at] this age [, you know ,] whether they're jordache new [or] whether they're *listen; ""because"" may start new [utt] unit [you know ,] something" 
A|50| A: [of course] [not] . 
B|51| B: [and] they're [both] boys [so] they [just] [one year] after [the] other _in_ each other's clothes [, so .] [but [,] um ,] _that's the_ hardest part _for us_ _is_ [that it's] [really [,] um [,] you know ,] budgeting [and] [some] extra _things_ [, you know [,] that] [are] [more] [, you know ,] nonessential items . 
A|52| A: _well , i_ [found] [, uh [,] that] , [in] [the] [place] [that] _it was_ harder [for] me [to] stick [to a] [budget] [was] [not] [where [we] were] concerned [, but] [where] maybe [our] [friends] [were] concerned [and] [our] relatives [and] parents . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [uh [, [we] ,] we] tended [to] [want to] keep [on] giving lavish , gifts _as_ [, we] had [done] before . 
B|55| B: yeah . yeah . [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and] [i] [really] believe [that] [if] _you're going to_ cut [down] [on] yourself [, you] need [to] cut [down] somewhat _on your friends_ . 
B|57| B: [on your friends] , [that's] true , [that's] true [. [well ,] we] [have] [so] _many_ unexpected _things_ [come] [up] [so] often [it] seems with [, we both] [have] older cars [and] [something] _will_ [come] [up] [and] wind [up] having _to spend_ [a] _thousand dollars_ [, you know ,] [on the] car [in] [two] [months] [or] [something] , 
A|58| A: yes . 
B|59| B: [and [,] you know [,] a] lot [of] _things_ like [that] _that [really_ are] hard [to] plan [for] . [and , uh ,] 
A|60| A: _well , i_ [really] [do] [, i] think [you [have] [to] budget] those [things] though . 
B|61| B: yeah , [kind of] [put] [in] [a] certain amount _per_ [year] , *82 [and] 84 same [utt] ? 
A|62| A: yes . 
B|63| B: [you're going to] [have] [on] extra [expenses] [for] car . 
A|64| A: exactly , although [so] [much] [per] month [anyway] . 
B|65| B: yeah , yeah . 
A|66| A: [and , uh [,] [that] really] should [be] [in] [your] [but] [if] [you] [don't spend] [it ,] [it] should [be] [in] [your] [bank] account _at the end of the_ month 
B|67| B: yeah [our] biggest _way_ [of] saving [money] _is_ [then] [to] stop [all] these deductions [, um [,] you know ,] _is_ [to] , let's [see ,] [now] [, i] forget which _way_ [we] [do] [it] . [we] [don't] list [all] [the] deductions [and then we] get [more] [money] back [, you know [,] [at the] end of _the] year_ , 
A|68| A: [oh , no] [, no] [, no] [, no .] 
B|69| B: [so ,] [that's] [not] [a] good _way_ [to] 
A|70| A: [you] [don't] [want] [the] government [to spend] [your] [money] . [you] [want [to] be] able , 
B|71| B: _that's what_ [my husband] [said] [, so] this last [year] [he] changed [it [,] [of] course] [, [we] didn't] get hardly [and then] nearly [as] [much] back _and it was_ like [oh [, no] .] better find another _way_ [of] saving [money] 
A|72| A: [well [,] uh [,] but] [i] [do] realize [that] [, that] [is] [realistic] [for] [some] people , 
B|73| B: yeah . 
A|74| A: [and it was] [for us] [many] [years ,] [for] [many] [years] . 
B|75| B: yeah . yeah . 
A|76| A: [uh [,] and] [if] [, and] [if] [that's the] only [way] [that] [will] , [it] [will] [make] [you] [save and] [have _a] little_ nest egg [at the end of _the] [,_ [the] year] [then] doggone [it] [that's what] [you] should [do] . 
B|77| B: yeah , [because we] [don't] miss [it [,] [we] really] [don't] [, when] [it's] [just] taking _out [of_ the] paycheck [and] stuff [, so .] [but] [we're] trying [to] [put] [a little] [money] away [for] [the] kids [because we] _can_ envision [the [,] uh ,] [expenses] [for] [college] already [, you know ,] [eighteen years] away [or] whatever . 
A|78| A: [uh-huh] [, uh-huh [.] _well ,] i_ [was] [just] reading [an] article [in] [, uh [,] a] north carolina paper today [where] [a] high [school] student obtained over [two] hundred [thousand dollars] worth [of] scholarships [for] herself by sitting [up] [at] [night] [and] typing [at] [, uh ,] letters [of] applications [to] universities . 
B|79| B: gosh . 
A|80| A: she [was] she [was] third [out [of] a] class [of] [two] hundred [and] twenty [, so ,] [it] [can] [be] [done] . 
B|81| B: [i] guess , 
A|82| A: [where] [there's] [a] [will] , [where] [there's] [a] [will] , [there's] [a] [way] , right ? 
B|83| B: [that's] fantastic . yeah 
A|84| A: _well , i_ [have] _enjoyed talking to you_ . 
B|85| B: [well , i] [enjoyed talking to you] [too] , good luck [and] [don't spend] any [money] this weekend 
A|86| A: [oh [,] i] [know] [we'll] [have to] stay [home] [and] mow [the] yard 
B|87| B: [oh ,] boy .
