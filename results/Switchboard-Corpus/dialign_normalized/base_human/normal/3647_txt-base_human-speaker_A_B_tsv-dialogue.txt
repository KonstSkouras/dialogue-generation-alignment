A|32| A: _what_ [uh] _what_ _do_ [you] feel [are] important _to_ [you] _or_ _other people_ _as_ _as_ crucial _benefits_ ? 
B|33| B: _uh-huh [._ well] [i'm] [a] little _different_ [than] [other people] _because _i_ don't have_ [benefits] _with_ _my job_ . 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [i'm] [a] nurse _and i_ _work_ 
A|36| A: [oh] 
B|37| B: [i] float _so _that_ i_ _have_ no [benefits] except higher pay [for] [doing] _that_ . 
A|38| A: [uh-huh _.] _right_ . uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: _so i_ find _that_ it makes up [for] [what] [i] pay [for] _insurance_ _and _i_ i_ _make_ enough money _by_ [the] _hour_ _to make_ up [for] _that_ . 
A|40| A: [to] [to] compensate [for] some [of] [the] [benefits] . 
B|41| B: [right . uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [oh] . 
B|43| B: [yeah] it's cheaper [for] me [to] buy _insurance_ _by_ [the] month [than] [to] _work_ staff someplace . 
A|44| A: [yes] . 
B|45| B: [and] [then i] _have_ _my_ freedom [. _i] can_ _work_ seven _days_ _in a_ row [and] take _a week_ off [or] whatever [i] want _to do_ . 
A|46| A: [well] [that] _that's_ an excellent [so] actually [that] _is_ [a] benefit [uh] 
B|47| B: [well] it [is] [to] me . most [people] prefer [the] security [of] _nine_ [to] five [and] weekends off [and] knowing [that] their _insurance_ [is] paid [and] their _retirement_ 
A|48| A: [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [and i'm] [just] [really] _not_ interested [in] [all] [that] . 
A|50| A: [right _.] right_ _well i guess_ _that's_ [a] [good] point [uh] 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [i] [do] belong [to] [a] [a] large corporation [or] [my] [that] where [i'm] currently employed [and] there's [uh] there's some [different] things [uh] one [that] you've already mentioned [is] [is] health [insurance] [. _i] think_ through our health [insurance] [that [i] can] get better rates _as_ [a] through [a] group plan _as_ opposed [to] going out [and] getting health [insurance] on an individual basis [because i] [had] [to do] [that] at one time when [i] wasn't employed [with] [a] large corporation 
B|53| B: [right .] 
A|54| A: [and] [that] got [to] be somewhat expensive [so [i] _i] think_ one [of] [the] [benefits] [i i] see [is] [the] [uh] [is] [the] group [uh] group discount . 
B|55| B: [yeah [.] right] [and] especially _if_ [you] _have a family_ . 
A|56| A: [yes] . 
B|57| B: [then [i] think] it makes [a] big difference . 
A|58| A: [yes] [and] _that's_ _that's_ one _thing_ [i] [do] [have] . 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [if] [i] didn't [have a family] [i don't] [think] [i] would [have] _as_ _as_ [a] male [or] _as_ [a] _as_ an individual [of] [in] this stage [of] [my] life [i don't] [think] [i] would [have] [insurance] [uh] [other] 
B|61| B: [right .] 
A|62| A: [i don't] [think] [i] would go through [that] expense . one [other] benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous [job] [i] [really] enjoyed [because] they [had] [what] [was] called flex schedule where [i] _could_ go [and i] _could_ [work] [uh] [nine] [hour] [days] [and] [have] _like_ friday only [work] four hours 
B|63| B: [oh yeah .] 
A|64| A: [or] [i] _could_ [do] [uh] [work] four [days] [a week] at ten hours [a] day [and] [have a] [you] know three day weekend . [and] [make] [uh] [make] [my job] flexible [in] [that] case . 
B|65| B: [right .] [could] [you] change [that] [as] [you] felt [like] it [or] did [you] [have] [to do] it _the same_ _every_ [week] ? 
A|66| A: [well] basically [yeah] [i] [had] [to do] [that] [uh] [the same] [uh] [for] [about] [every] quarter [of] [the] year [. i] mean [uh] [because i] [was] [in a] [in a] position [of] management [i] [had] responsibilities over [people] [that] [uh] [i] needed [to make] [my] schedule [uh] [so that] [if] [i] [was] [not] there [i] would [have] coverage [by] some [other] management personnel 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [so] [so [i] [i] think] [that] [uh] [that was] [a] [that was] an excellent benefit [that i] [really] enjoyed 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [and [i] don't have] [that] [in] [my] current operation [but] [uh] [you] mentioned [uh] flexible [work] schedule [and] _that's_ _that's_ [good .] 
B|71| B: [yeah .] 
A|72| A: [and] [uh] [what] [other] [benefits] [do] [you] [think] [are] important ? 
B|73| B: [oh] [well i guess] _retirement_ [that] kind [of] [thing] [which] [i don't] worry much [about] [so] 
A|74| A: [yeah] [yeah] _that's_ true . 
B|75| B: [i] [just] prefer [to] worry [about] [today] probably [not] [a] practical attitude [but] [that's] who [i] am [so] 
A|76| A: [well] [and] [that's] an individual [thing] . 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [yeah] [with] [uh] [with] our current [uh] organization we [do] [have a] nice [retirement] package [and] [also] [a] [a] nice [thing] [that] [that] we [have] [in] our corporation [is] [a] [uh] [is] [a] profit sharing plan where we [can] [uh] participate [in] [the] [the] profits [of] [the] company . [if] [we're] [you] know [if] we've been there [a] while [and] [we're] vested [uh] [which] means [that] [you] know we [have a] an interest [uh] [in] [the] company [that] we [can] [uh] get some [of] [the] [benefits] [of] [the] either [the] profit high times [or] [or] [in a] sense suffer during [the] low times 
B|79| B: [right .] 
A|80| A: [and] [uh] [also] [uh] [in] one [of] [my] wife's [uh] companies where she worked they'd [had a] real nice profit sharing plan [that] [that]
