B|3| B: _sure_ [go ahead] . 
A|4| A: _uh in_ _dallas_ _there's_ definitely _a crime_ problem _i_ _know it's_ _you know_ worse _in the_ larger _cities ._ _um_ _it's_ _kind _of_ a_ concern _for_ _me_ _in fact_ _at the_ moment _i'm_ thinking _of_ possibly moving _to a_ new apartment _and uh_ _it's_ _i_ am single _and_ female [you] definitely _are_ _going to_ worry _about_ _the_ location _and uh you know_ accessibility _of_ _people_ _to be_ able [to] break _in_ _. i_ _live_ _on_ _a_ third floor _now_ _but i_ _you know_ _i'm_ real concerned _that_ _i i don't_ [want _to] be_ _on_ _a_ _first_ floor _where_ [you] can _have_ problems _with_ _things_ _like_ _that _and_ the_ _um_ 
B|5| B: _do_ _they have_ _many_ _buildings_ [that] [have] security _there_ ? 
A|6| A: _some_ [buildings] _do it_ depends _on the_ location . _the_ _area_ _i_ _live_ _in_ _right_ _now_ _is_ _is_ real _good_ _as far as_ _crime_ rate _is_ concerned _and _we_ _don't_ have_ _anything_ _at_ [all] _no_ burglar alarms _no_ guards . 
B|7| B: _yeah yeah_ _well [i_ _i] went to_ [dallas] [uh] when [i] worked _for t i_ [in] abilene [and uh] [i'm] _a little_ familiar [with] [the] _city_ [area] forest lane [and] [you know] through [that] _off_ _off_ [the] freeway . 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: [and uh] [it] didn't seem [like] _it was_ [that] congested [in] _that that_ part . [you know] _because_ [to] [me] [where] [we] [live] _out_ _here_ [in the] north _east_ [it] [it's] _there_ [are] _a lot of_ [buildings] _very_ close [to] each other 
A|10| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: [and the] [cities] [are] _very_ populated [with] tenement housing [where] _there_ [are] _more_ than one family [in] [a] house _. and_ [with] [the] [uh] [people] _that are_ coming into [the] _country_ _from_ other _countries_ _not_ knowing [the] language 
A|12| A: _uh-huh ._ _um_ . 
B|13| B: [and _uh] they're_ [going _to] the_ _big [cities_ _.] it_ makes [it] _very_ difficult . 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [it] _really_ does _and and_ i've seen [the] same thing [that] you're talking [about] [uh] _much_ _more_ [crime] than ever before . _drugs_ [of] course [uh] [a] _big_ part _of it_ _i think_ . 
A|16| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: [and uh] [i don't] [know] _a lot of_ younger [people] [you know] into _more_ violent crimes . 
A|18| A: _oh_ [yeah _yeah] ._ 
B|19| B: [that] _that's really sad_ [you know] [you] got young boys _or_ girls [that] [at] fourteen _or_ twelve years old _that are_ committing murders [and] [no] remorse _what_ _so_ ever . 
A|20| A: _uh-huh ._ _there's_ [a lot of] [that] [going] _on_ [in] [dallas] _too_ . 
B|21| B: [yeah .] 
A|22| A: [yeah] [it's] [really sad] . 
B|23| B: _it is_ _and _and_ [i_ don't] [know] _if_ [it's] [uh] [the] family [you know] thing [where] _they're_ _not_ bonding anymore [where] mothers [are] working _all the_ time [and the] kids aren't _getting_ [the] attention [that] _they_ need _or_ [the] television . 
A|24| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|25| B: _and [i_ i] [really] _think that_ we're we're falling _by_ [the] wayside [with] _not_ incarcerating _these_ [people] . 
A|26| A: _oh i_ agree _. _i_ think that _people_ are_ [getting] [off] _too easy ._ [they're] [getting] [they're] [getting] paroled _too_ easily . 
B|27| B: [uh] _uh ._ 
A|28| A: [they're] just [getting] [uh] _put_ _on_ probation [or] something [because] [the] prisons _don't have_ _enough_ room [so] _they get_ _they get_ lighter sentences 
B|29| B: [yeah] exactly . 
A|30| A: [and] _some_ [of] those [people] _they don't_ _deserve to be_ let loose . 
B|31| B: [and uh _you know] they_ _had_ [uh [in] fact] [on the] news last _night_ [we] _were_ watching _this_ [uh] man who lost his _ten_ year old daughter . _he_ ran _out_ _to the_ store _for a few minutes _and_ he_ _had_ _left_ her home alone _. now_ _ten_ years old she's old [enough] [to be] alone _for a few minutes_ [you know] . 
A|32| A: _oh_ [yeah .] 
B|33| B: [and] while _he_ _was_ gone _he_ _had_ looked _went_ looking _for a_ job [and] stopped [at the] store _that's_ _what _it_ was_ _. [and_ uh] someone who _was_ [in the] neighborhood cleaning carpets _these_ two men _went_ [in] raped [the] _girl_ murdered her [and the] whole bit . 
A|34| A: _oh_ my gosh . 
B|35| B: [and] one [of] [the] men got [uh] [i think] _it was_ seventeen years [and the] other one _was_ [in] [for] [uh] _life_ imprisonment . 
A|36| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|37| B: [the] one [that] _was_ [in] [for] [the] seventeen years actually served seven [and] he's _out ._ 
A|38| A: [uh] [that's] terrible . 
B|39| B: [and the] man _said_ _that [you_ know] _if_ [it] weren't [for] [the] [fact] [that] _he_ _would_ [go] [to] jail [that] _he_ _would_ eliminate _this_ person himself _. and_ then [go] [to] mcdonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] _not_ thing [a] thing [think] [a] thing [about] _it ._ 
A|40| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|41| B: _and _i_ mean [i_ think that] _what_ _this_ [is] [going to] lead [to] [is] [people] _will_ _take_ [things] into _their_ own hands _. and_ [that] innocent [people] 
A|42| A: [yeah .] 
B|43| B: [i i] _shouldn't_ say innocent [because] _i mean_ actually _if_ [they] commit [a crime] [that] [they're] [in the] same _circumstances_ [but] 
A|44| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|45| B: [the] reasons [that] [they're] doing [it] compared _to the_ reason someone else _is in_ jail [for] [it] [you [know] it's] [like] two different [things] . 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: sometimes when [you] lose someone _that you_ [really] love [you] _do some_ crazy [things] [i don't] [know] 
A|48| A: _right_ [it's] [a little] [more] understandable under [the] [circumstances] [i] guess . 
B|49| B: [i i] [like] [the] idea [that] [uh] _if_ someone [is] _from_ [a] foreign _country_ _and they_ _come_ [to] _this_ _country_ [and uh] commit [a crime] [i think that] irregardless [of] whether _they have_ already become [a] citizen _or anything_ [they] _should_ [be] immediately deported . 
A|50| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|51| B: _especially_ _if they're_ found guilty [of] _the crime_ . 
A|52| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|53| B: [you know] once _they _they_ have_ been arrested _and if_ [they] [know] beyond [a] shadow [of a] doubt _these_ [people are] guilty . 
A|54| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|55| B: [that's] [it] [we don't] _take care of_ _them_ [we don't] support _them_ _nothing_ 
A|56| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|57| B: _i mean_ [they] [go] [right] _back_ [where] [they] came _from_ . 
A|58| A: [right] _we have_ [enough] [enough] problems [with] overcrowding [in the] jails _as_ [it _is] ._ [so] let let [their] [country] [take care [of] [it] .] 
B|59| B: exactly [and] 
A|60| A: [we _don't] have_ [i] guess _too_ [much] trouble [in] [dallas] [with] [well i] guess [i] guess [we] [do] [have [a] lot of] [people] [come] [in] [from] mexico [that] cause problems [but] [uh .] 
B|61| B: [but] [that's] _uh they're_ [so] close [i i don't] consider mexican [people] [in the] same category [with] [uh] _especially_ [like] [uh] [people] who [come] [from] cultures [that] [don't _have] the_ same [uh] [kind of] moral upbringing [that] [we have] . 
A|62| A: [yeah .] _uh-huh ._ 
B|63| B: [like] [you] [take] asian _countries_ [or] [uh] [the] eastern _countries_ [where] women [are] _like [in_ the] foreground [uh [in] the] background [and the] men [are] [in the] foreground 
A|64| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: [and] [it's] [like] [you know] [um] [they] [live] _back in_ [where] [we] came [from] two hundred years ago . 
A|66| A: _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|67| B: [you know] we've advanced beyond [that _and] [i_ think that] [their] [uh] mentality [as far as] _the way_ [they] treat _them_ [and] [that] [kind of] thing [you _know] what_ _i mean_ . 
A|68| A: _uh-huh [._ [it] was] _amazing_ [i went [to] the] [far] [east] [uh] [back in] october _to [do_ some] training [for t i] [and i] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [uh] [some] [of] those [countries] [were] [so] safe [it was] unreal . singapore [is] [very] supposed [to be] [very] safe [and] [in fact] tokyo [and i] thought tokyo [would] [be] dangerous being such [a] huge large [city] [with] _so many_ [people] 
B|71| B: [yeah .] 
A|72| A: _but they_ [at] [at the] [t i] [there] [i] [said] [is] [there] any [area] [i] [should] avoid [. [and] the] guy [said] let [me] ask another [girl] [here] [and he] turned [and] asked [this] [girl] [and] [said] can [you] [think] [of] any place [where] dana [shouldn't] [go] [by] herself [or anything] [. and] she she thought [for a few minutes and] she [said] [no] [. [and] he] [said] [is] [there] any place _you wouldn't_ [go] [by] yourself . she [said] [no] [. [and] they] [said] [it is] [so] safe [there] [that you] can _leave_ _your_ purse [on the] subway 
B|73| B: wow . 
A|74| A: [and] somebody [will] turn [it] [in] [and and] [nothing] [will] [be] missing _. they_ [said] [they] can just [about] guarantee [that] [there] [that that] [would] happen _if you_ did _that _._ i_ thought boy [in] america _if you_ [left] [a] purse [on] [a] subway [you] [would] never see [it] _again ._ 
B|75| B: wow . [you] better _believe_ [it] [if [you] wouldn't] even _have to_ [leave] [it] _i mean_ 
A|76| A: [yeah] [that's] true 
B|77| B: [it] [would] [get] snatched [right] [off] [your] arm 
A|78| A: [that's] true . _but i_ [was] thinking boy [in] [dallas] [if] somebody asked [me] [if] [there] [were] places [you wouldn't] [go] [by] yourself [at] [night] i'd _have to set_ [them] down [for] [about] five [or] [ten] [minutes] [to] list [all the] places [out .] 
B|79| B: [oh] _sure_ . 
A|80| A: [i mean i] couldn't [believe] [that] she couldn't [think] [of] any place _. they_ [said] [the] apparently [the crime] [is] just [uh] 
B|81| B: [that's] [amazing] [well] what's [the] difference [there] [do] [you know] ? 
A|82| A: _i'm not_ [sure] [what [it] is] _there [._ now] [i] [know [what] [it] [is] in] singapore [is] [they [have] _the] death penalty_ [and they] [really] enforce [it] 
B|83| B: [oh [i] i] [believe] [in [the] death penalty] [i] [really] [do] . 
A|84| A: [like] [for] [drugs] [for] [drugs] [they they] enforce [the death penalty] _for that ._ [uh they're] just [very] [very] tough [and i] guess maybe _that's [the_ way] tokyo [is] _too_ [or] japan [is] _too_ . [they're] just [very] tough [on] criminals . 
B|85| B: [yeah _yeah] [i_ think that] we're [too easy .] 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [uh] [and we] [take] [the] [the] [uh] civil liberties [uh] stuff [too] [far] . 
A|88| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: [you know] [like] [people] _that are_ [in] prison [i mean] [we] didn't [put] [them] [there [.] they] [put] themselves [in] [that] situation . 
A|90| A: [uh-huh] [oh] [yeah .] 
B|91| B: [and] [as far as] [like] [them] [uh] entertaining [the] rights [that] [they] [should] [have] . 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [i mean] [we] educate [them] [we] feed [them] [we] [take care of] [them] [and they] [no] sooner [get] [out] [on the] street [and] [they're] [back in] [again .] 
A|94| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [i'm not] saying [they're] [all] bad [but [i] think] [people] who [are] guilty [of] [really] serious heinous crimes [do] [not] [deserve to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] [their] lives . 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] [right] . 
B|97| B: [i think that] [they] [should] [be] [put] away . 
A|98| A: [right] [and [if] they're] overcrowded [well] [you know they] [shouldn't] [have] gotten theirself [there] [in _the] first_ place . 
B|99| B: [get] rid [of] [them] . exactly [. [i] i] [really] [i [i] think that] [that's the] whole key [here] . [this] plea bargaining baloney [where] [uh [you know] they] plead [to a] lesser [crime] [or] [uh] [they] plead guilty [in] [or] [you know] tell [about] someone else [and [they] [they] get] less time 
A|100| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [or] [if they're] [in] [there] [and] _they've_ got seventeen years [and] [they're] [on] [good] behavior [for] every year [they're] [in] [they get] [so many] less [you know] [that] [they don't] serve [the] full [penalty] . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [i [i] i] [really] [think] we're [going to] [far] overboard [with] [all] [of] [this] . 
A|104| A: [oh] [yeah i] agree [because] [it's] [not] fair [to] those [of] us [that that] [deserve] [a] safe [you know] [life] [to] [have to] 
B|105| B: [yeah] same [with] drunk drivers . 
A|106| A: [right] . 
B|107| B: [i think] [it's] [too easy] [for] [them] . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [that] [if] [the] [the] laws [and and] [were] [were] harsher [and] [were] enforced 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [i mean] [you] [have to set] an example . [you] [have to] [start] somewhere . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [and [i] think that people] [know] [that] [they're] [going to] [get] [a] slap [on the] wrist [they] might serve [a little] bit [of] time [and] [that] they'll [be] [out] [on the] street [again .] 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: an [it] an [i] feel bad [for] [the] _policeman_ [because] he's [out] [there] every day facing _these_ [people] . [this] [this] craziness [you know] [people] [with] [uh] automatic weapons [and uh] [all] [this] other stuff [and] trying [to do] [a] job 
A|116| A: [uh-huh .] [right] . 
B|117| B: [and] let's face [it] [what] [do] [they get] paid . 
A|118| A: [right] [not] [much] . 
B|119| B: twenty thousand dollars [a] year [if they're] lucky [. i] [wouldn't] [do it] [for that .] 
A|120| A: [yeah] huh-uh [and] [especially] [not] [in] [some] [of] [these] [big cities] [like in] [dallas] [i mean] [they've] [had] [they're] up [in the] top top five [i think] [of] [cities] [that are] [getting] [policeman] killed [on] [on] [in the] line [of] duty [and] [that's really sad] . 
B|121| B: [it is] [it] [really] [is [.] [and] [i] mean] [they're] [the first] ones [that] [take] [the] brunt [of] everything . 
A|122| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: [you know] [and] [i'm not] saying [that] [they're] [all] [good] either [because] [there's] [good] [and] bad [in] everything 
A|124| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|125| B: [but they] [they're] already [uh] [have] three strikes against [them] when [they're] [out] [there .] 
A|126| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|127| B: [because] they'll arrest someone [and] [you know] [go] through [all] [that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and] [you] [have to] even [be] careful how [you] arrest [them] how [you] talk [to] [them] [uh you [know] what] [they] say
