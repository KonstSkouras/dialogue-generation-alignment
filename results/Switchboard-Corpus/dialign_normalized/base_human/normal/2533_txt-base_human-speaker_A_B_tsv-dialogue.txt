A|0| A: okay _, um ,_ _what_ _baseball team_ are _you_ _familiar with_ ? 
B|1| B: _well , i'm_ _only_ _a little bit_ [familiar with] _the_ red sox _because_ _i_ _lived_ _up_ _in_ boston _for a_ while , 
A|2| A: _really ?_ 
B|3| B: _and , um , and_ _that's_ , 
A|4| A: _oh ,_ now come _on ,_ no texas rangers ? 
B|5| B: after _that _,_ if you_ asked _me_ _that_ _i_ wouldn't _have been_ able _to_ tell [you] _if_ _that_ _was_ football _or_ [baseball] . 
A|6| A: _really ? i_ guess _they_ paired _two_ women together _on_ _this_ call [for a] reason _which is_ _something_ _we_ _can_ _think_ _about_ later _but , um _,_ i_ _understand_ [a little bit] _about_ [the] texas rangers _. _i_ know_ george _bush_ threw _out_ [the] _first_ pitch hitter bounced _off_ [the] ground [and] [that [,] um _,] yeah _,_ i_ heard [a] joke _on_ [the] radio yesterday [that ,] [in] regard [that] _he_ _didn't_ design [the] patriot missile system [, [and] _,] uh _,_ the_ radio's kind _of_ cruel _, _i_ mean ,_ _think _,_ _the_ _,_ _he_ ,_ _this_ chain [that] must [have been] _on_ president _bush_ [to] bounce [the] _first_ pitch _off_ [the] ground _, _i_ mean ,_ _how_ humiliating [for a] man _to _do that_ ,_ _any_ man _. _i_ don't_ care [if] _you're_ president . 
B|7| B: [yeah _,] but_ _at the_ same _time_ _, i don't know _,_ _it's_ pretty_ far [to] throw [that] far [i] _couldn't_ _do _it_ ._ 
A|8| A: _i know_ [but] _he's_ [a] man come _on ,_ men [know] _how_ _to _do that_ ,_ _right_ ? 
B|9| B: [right] _, he's_ _supposed _to_ be_ able [to do _that] ._ 
A|10| A: _i know_ _so_ [, i] felt kind _of_ sorry [for] _him_ . [that] must [have been] _hard_ _on_ _him_ [because] [he's] _just_ [a] person _but , um [,_ i] never , [a] major owner _of_ _our_ _of the_ _team_ here . 
B|11| B: _oh , [really ?_ _i] didn't_ _know _that_ ._ 
A|12| A: _yeah , _he's_ like_ [, _i] thought_ _he _was_ the_ owner _but it_ turns _out_ _my_ mom _said_ [that] [he's] _part_ owner _but he_ must own [the] biggest chunk [because] _that's all_ [you] hear _about_ _is_ [, if] _, you know ,_ _about_ neal _bush_ _i think_ _is_ _his_ name . 
B|13| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: _see [,_ i] _even know_ _his_ name [because] [he's] _on_ [the] _news_ _a lot _,_ and i_ never _had_ [to] _watch_ [the] _news_ _not_ _, you know _,_ _not_ like_ _some_ people hour [and] [a] half [a] _day_ [or] anything . 
B|15| B: _yeah , and_ i've [been] watching [, uh ,] _my husband's_ french _and so_ [if] i've [been] watching [the] french [news] , _when_ [i] [watch] _it ._ 
A|16| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: _it's_ incentive , speaking [of] [bush] , we're _going to_ _get [a_ little] [off] topic [but] speaking [of] [bush] _, they_ [that] _had a_ story _where_ [he] went [to] visit [some] [little] [, uh ,] elementary school students _, _and stuff_ ._ 
A|18| A: [oh [,] i] saw [that .] 
B|19| B: _did you_ [see] [that ,] _where_ [he [,] the] guy asked [him] [for] proof [of] who [he was] , 
A|20| A: _yeah ._ 
B|21| B: _he said_ [his] . 
A|22| A: [i] _want to see_ _your_ driver's _i , _i_ , i don't_ , 
B|23| B: _i know and_ [see] [a] credit card 
A|24| A: _you're_ _not_ president [bush] _. [i_ know _and] [he_ said] [yeah _,] it_ _does_ [so] fast [, i] heard [it] _on_ [the] radio _. i_ heard [the] audio portion _on_ [the] radio [in] [the] car _but [i_ didn't] [see] [it] _but ,_ 
B|25| B: _it was_ [so] _funny_ [to [see] _,] it was_ [a] [really] cute [little] kid _too_ . 
A|26| A: [that's] _about_ [my] extent [of] [, um ,] _about baseball_ [, i don't know _,] that_ _much_ _about_ [it .] 
B|27| B: _well [,_ i] [can] tell _you [,_ that] [the] mets opened _, i [think_ ,] [two] days ago , 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [because] [my] brother [was] _supposed to_ _go to_ [the] opening _game_ [, and i] _couldn't_ tell [you] who pitched , 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [but] [they] won [, the] mets won . 
A|32| A: [did] [they] ? 
B|33| B: [but [,] yeah [,] not] [my] [a lot ,] *sp ? _by_ _and then_ somebody _else_ _lost ,_ maybe _it was the_ _other_ new york [team] [which _is] the_ yankees , 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [but _i] don't [even_ know] [if] _they're_ still new york yankees , [or] new jersey . 
A|36| A: [that's] [so] stupid [that] [you] _all_ [have] [two] teams . 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: [that's] [really] stupid . 
B|39| B: _well _,_ [but_ _it] _,_ then_ [they] [can] [have] _them_ _play_ against each _other_ . 
A|40| A: [yeah [,] [i] know] . 
B|41| B: [i think] _it's_ still [the] new york yankees [, you know ,] 
A|42| A: [yeah .] 
B|43| B: [i thought] [they] _were_ moving [to] new jersey _this is_ [how] [much] [i know] [about baseball] . 
A|44| A: [the] texas rangers [, they] [, they] [lost [,] i think] . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [but [i] [know] that] _last year we_ [did] _go to _a_ baseball game_ _last year_ . _we_ _got_ free _tickets_ [because] _someone_ [at] _our_ church , _one of the_ deacons [at] church [, um ,] parks cars [at the] mansion [at] turtle creek [which _is] like_ _one of the [,_ uh [,] the] places [and stuff .] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: _and he's_ their head chauffeur _, is_ [this] [funny] , _as_ [they're] parking [the] cars [the] valet service . 
B|49| B: _right ._ 
A|50| A: [yeah _,] he_ _makes_ good money [too] doing [that ,] you'd [be] [i] [was] shocked [, but] anyway , _someone_ gave an iranian [a] tip [of] four rangers _tickets_ _last year_ , 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [and then] [the] iranian [couldn't] _, he_ [didn't] _want_ [them] _, so_ [he] gave [them] [to] alan [, and] alan [and] [his] dad [had] plans [that] night [so] [they] gave [them] [to] _us_ _, so_ [he] decided [that] [some] wealthy man tipped [this] iranian , _with baseball _tickets_ ,_ 
B|53| B: [with baseball tickets] . 
A|54| A: [and] _we_ ended [up] [with] [them] , [right .] [and so] _we_ [were] , walking [up] 
B|55| B: [yeah .] 
A|56| A: [and i] looked [at] _my husband and i_ [said] [, you _know] what_ kyle [this [is] the] mansion [at] turtle creek [a] tip [i] bet _these_ are [really] good _seats [and_ so] _we_ ended [up] _on_ _first_ base [right] down _there_ _on_ [the] floor , 
B|57| B: wow . 
A|58| A: [oh [,] _yeah ,] we_ [they] called _us_ [at] five [and] [the] [game] started [at] seven [so] _we_ _just_ threw everything together , ran over [and] _got_ [the] [tickets] [and] walked [and so] _we_ took [two] _kids_ [with] _us_ [and] nobody brings [two] _children_ [in] _these_ _seats_ [, you know] _because ,_ 
B|59| B: _because they're_ fancy [seats [and] stuff .] 
A|60| A: [yeah , _and] you_ _just_ _sit_ down _and all_ [the] girls [were] _all_ dressed [up] _you know , i_ _just_ [was] _there_ [, you know ,] _like_ [i'm] loaded [, i'm] here [, you know [,] [and] [,] uh [,] it was] _just_ kind [of] [funny] _because , you know [,_ _but] we_ _got_ [to] _sit_ [by] _first_ base [if] [they] [did] hit [a] ball [i] would [have been] afraid [it] would [have] knocked [my] face _in [,_ you know] . 
B|61| B: [i know] [i'm] _always_ scared [of] [that] whenever [i] [go to a] [game] [. i] rarely [go] [but we] went [last year] [because] [my] brother , [my] brother [is] impossible , _when_ [, um [,] he] [does] football _leagues_ [and] [baseball] _leagues_ [and all] _kinds of_ _stuff ,_ 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [and] [if] _there's a_ [game] [on [,] he's] watching _it . [i_ mean _,] [that's_ all] [there] [is] [to] _it ,_ 
A|64| A: [really ?] 
B|65| B: [and [he's] like] glued [at the] t v . 
A|66| A: _i'm glad my husband's not like [that_ .] 
B|67| B: [oh [,] [i'm] glad my husband's not like that] either , i'd kill [him] [my] brother's _like that _and_ , um ,_ [see] [he] goes [to _a] lot of_ _games_ [, not] [a] _real_ [lot [,] [but] he] tries [to] _go _,_ then_ [my] father [got] [us] [some] [tickets ,] 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [so] [my] brother's wife _and [my_ husband and i] went . [last year we] wanted [to] show [my husband] [what] [a baseball game] [was] [because , you know ,] being [a] non-american [you] [want to see] [what] [a baseball game] [is like] . 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [and he] describes [it] [as] [, you] [sit] [there] [in] [a] crowd [, it was] _nice_ weather [and _stuff] [,_ it] wasn't [a] _real_ problem [, but] [you] [sit] [there] [in] [a] crowd [, and] [you're] waiting [and] waiting [and] waiting [and you] eat [these] lousy [the] hot dogs [um _,] because_ [we] _made_ [him] try [a] hot dog [, you know ,] 
A|72| A: [that's] [funny] . 
B|73| B: _and , um [,_ _so] you_ [sit] [there] [and you] wait [for] [the] longest _time_ [really] bored [, [and] then] [all] _of a_ sudden [something] happens [but] [you] happen [to] look [the] _other_ way during [the] _time_ , 
A|74| A: [you] miss [the] whole thing . 
B|75| B: [yeah , [and] so] [you're] basically [you] [sit] [there] [and] wait [for] [something] exciting [to] happen [and] _when_ [it] happened [he] missed _it [,_ and] [didn't] [understand] [it] [um [,] he] grew [up] [out] _, well [,_ he] grew [up] [in ,] [which [is] [the] ,] sort [of] o strip east [to] west , eastern [part] , 
A|76| A: [that's] [funny] . [where] [is] [he] from [in] france ? [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [but] [that ,] 
A|78| A: [yeah [.] i] _have a_ [, i] [had a] friend [in] college from _strasbourg ,_ 
B|79| B: [yeah , he's] [not] [that] far [, [he] was] sort [of] [in] between [strasbourg [,] and] _paris ._ 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] [paris .] [and my] _cousin_ lives _in paris_ [and] she's [lived] [there] [for] [like] , [oh ,] [off] [and] [on] [for] twenty years . 
B|81| B: [oh [,] is] _she_ still [there] ? 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [because ,] 
A|84| A: _saint claude_ [is] [that] sound [familiar] ? 
B|85| B: [yeah ,] [saint claude] , 
A|86| A: [yeah .] 
B|87| B: [yeah , we] used [to] _, that's_ [one of the [,] um ,] entrances [to] [the] periphery [to] _get_ [in] [and] _out of the_ city . 
A|88| A: [oh , really ?] 
B|89| B: [and] _it [,_ _it] [,_ _it] [,_ it] sits [right] [at the] limit , 
A|90| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: [i] exactly [where] _she_ [is] _. [but_ , um [,] we] met [in [paris] .] 
A|92| A: [that's] neat . [yeah ,] [she] married [and] [they] [have] _twelve children_ . 
B|93| B: [twelve children] ? 
A|94| A: [she] has [twelve children] . 
B|95| B: [oh ,] [my] _god [,_ the] poor woman . 
A|96| A: [she] looks gorgeous , no she's gorgeous [and] [she] _just_ liked _having_ _kids_ [and] she's thin [and [,] [i] mean ,] four [or] _more_ [children] are thin , 
B|97| B: [were] [any] _of them_ twins ? 
A|98| A: [i mean [,] i'm] [not] kidding [you] . 
B|99| B: [you] _probably_ _can't_ afford [to] eat _if you_ [have] [more] _than_ [two] _of them_ 
A|100| A: no , _your_ [, i] _have a_ friend now [that] has seven . [and , um , and] [they're] [all] eight [and] under [, and] nine [and] under , 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [they're] [all] [real] young , [they're] _just_ raised [right] [that's] [what] god's told [them] [to do] [but] [they're] [not] condemning [you [,] if [you] [,] we] [only] [have] [one] child [, you know [,] they] [don't] say [, they] [don't] put [on] bad [or] anything [which is] good [because] [it] would [be] easy [, i'm] sure , [for] [them] [to _do that] , you_ [get a] conviction [like that [and] you] [think] everyone should [have] [it .] [and so] [i'm] [real] proud [of them] [because they're] aren't [really] [, they] [don't] [do that] [at] [all] . 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [you] [go] [in] their bathroom [and] [there's] ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [and i] [always] give her [a] _hard_ [time] whose toothbrush [did you] [really] use [this] morning 
B|105| B: [but] [how] [do] [they] afford [to] [even] [have] _the _kids_ [,_ uh ,] we're expecting [our] [first] baby , almost [any] [day] [uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [uh-huh .] [they] live lean [for] [one] thing [and] [they] tithe [and] [they] [it] puts [a] whole [in] _your_ money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor [god] [with] [this] portion [and so] [they] [, i think] [that] helps [a lot] [. [i] think] [that's] [the] key , [in] [he ,] [like] [his] sales [last year] [he] _just_ works [a] normal job . [he] [probably] has an income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] [last year] [he] [made] [that] [got] [him] [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand [which] allowed [him] [to] pay cash [for a] full size van . [he] loves [god [,] [i] mean [,] [it was] the] biggest thing [that] [any] [one] [in] [this] company [had] ever done , 
B|107| B: wow . 
A|108| A: [and he] [got] [to [do] it] [and so] [god] _just_ [really] blesses [him] [in] ways [like [that] ,] [do] trust [god] [because [,] i don't know ,] [kids] are [a] blessing [and [,] and] [some] people [you know [,] we] [think] [of] blessings [as] [nice] furniture [and] things [like [that] [,] but] [kids] are _just as_ [much] [of a] blessing inside [these] material things [but] [it's] [a] different kind [and] [a lot] times people [think ,] [oh [,] [well ,] i'm] [not] blessed [i] [have] an old car [. but] you've [got] five [kids [,] you know ,] 
B|109| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [you're] _just as_ blessed , [probably] [more] [, because] [if you] follow [this] , [there's a] good book called [what] [the] bible has [to] say [about] child training , [by] richard fugate 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [and he's] [, you know ,] [a lot of] wisdom [in] [it .] [and] [the kids] [at] bible talk [about] anything [but] training [, and] training [is] different [than] anything [else] [in ,] [in] psychology doesn't address [it .] [a lot [of] the] psychology [stuff [,] the] good [stuff] [that's] [in] psychology [it] _just_ comes [out of the] bible [and] [they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out of] [it [,] but] [the] things [that] work [in] psychology [other] [the] years [that] they've proven [to] work [, they] _just_ come [out of the] bible [and so] [this] book [it] _just_ [really] [all] [these] things [and] [how] [to] train [the] child [so] [they're] [not] [going [to] be] [a] curse [to] [you] [when] [they're] thirteen . 
B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [what] [i mean] [how] [to] train [them] [so] [they're] [going [to] be] [a] blessing [and so] [, you know [,] they] [do [that] and] [they] [, they] _just_ live lean [pretty] [much] [they] [don't] , [she] doesn't shop [at] _foley's_ [you know [,] and stuff] [like [that] [.] but] [a lot] women die [or] shop [at] _foley's_ [so] things , 
B|115| B: [i [, i don't] [know] what] [foley's] [is] 
A|116| A: [it's] [like] [a] macy's , kind [of] store , 
B|117| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|118| A: [it's pretty] [nice] [and] everything's [pretty] expensive [and [,] you know [,] you] _just_ [can't] [do [that] [and] you] [don't] [go to] [baseball] [games] [as] [much] [or] [you] [get] pictures [like] [we] [did] . [you [know] what] [i mean] ? 
B|119| B: [yeah .] 
A|120| A: [you] [do] [these] fun things [, you know ,] [in] [other] [kinds of] ways [and [i] know] manhattan's [real] expensive [but , um [,] it's] kind [of a] different situation [because] [you're] [probably] living [in] an apartment , [right] ? 
B|121| B: [yeah [,] well [,] that] [makes] [a] [really] big difference [. [but] [,] [but] ,] still [it's] [just as] [hard] [as] [having] _, that ,_ 
A|122| A: [yeah .] 
B|123| B: [but] [your] [cousin] _could_ [have [a] [baseball] team] [with] [twelve] [kids] 
A|124| A: [well ,] church softball [leagues] [, so] , 
B|125| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|126| A: [they're] [not] [all] boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have a] girls' league [because] [i'm] [the] [one] [that's] [supposed to] start [one] [and i] [just] haven't gotten around [to] doing [it . i] keep saying [we] need [to] [have] [one] . [they] [go ,] okay [, then] start [one] [. but] everybody wants [to [do] it] [but [,] you know ,] god's sitting [on] [my] heart [and i] [just] hadn't gotten around [to] doing [it [,] but] anyway [, so] [they] [could] [really] [only] [have] four members [on] [the] [team] [. [i] think] [they] [only] [have] four boys [. [i] don't even] [think] [they] [have] [but] [two] old enough [to] [play] yet . 
B|127| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: [but , um [,] then] [you] [didn't] believe [me] [about] her [kids] *listen: [this] [and] utt2 [as] [one] utt are [the] [they] are [so] good . [i'm] [not] kidding [you] [but] [she] [does] work [with] [them] [and] [it's] [a] commitment [and [,] that [,] that's] [what] [they're] called [to do] . 
B|129| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|130| A: [i] [have a] , most [of] [my] friends , 
B|131| B: [i] admire [someone] [that] [can] [do that [, [you] know ,] i] [really] [can] . 
A|132| A: [i [know] , i] [do] [too] [, [i] ,] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four [kids] [and] [they] feel [like] [, you know [,] that's] [really] why [god] [and] [some] [of the] people [in] [our] church use birth control [and] [some] [of them] [don't] [, i] [had] [my] tubes tied [so [you] ,]
