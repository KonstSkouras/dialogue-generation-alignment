B|5| B: [and] _that_ _that_ [the] penalty ought _to_ _be_ _out_ _there_ [and] _be_ enforced ?

A|10| A: [there has] [that's] _right_ . 
B|11| B: _because_ [if] _they_ turn around _they_ _can_ _get_ away _they_ _get_ away with _it_ [and] _they_ _get_ away with _it_ [and] _they_ _get_ away with _it_ [and] then _they_ do something worse

A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: [that's] _what_ [that's] _what_ _people_ face with _that_ choice . one _thing_ [i] [really] hate _is_ [they] [don't] explain [to] [the] jurors _in a_ _in a_ trial _in a_ [capital] murder trial _or_ [in] cases [of] rape _or_ [in] different _things_ _that_ [are] [so] horrible _what_ [it] means [when they] [sentence] [them] _to [you_ know] they'll [sentence] [them] [to] ninety [years] [and] [say] _that_ [it's] [you know] _that_ [it's] [going _to] [you_ know] 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: _that_ should _be_ life _but_ instead [in] [in] given [the] choice [of] _either_ sentencing [to] death _or_ sentencing [to] life they'll give [them] ninety [years] [in] [prison] _or_ something [and] then turn around [in] thirty [years] _that_ [you know] [and] _less_ they're [out] . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: _even_ [if] [if] they're _even_ [in] _that_ long . _or_ [they] appeal [and] then [they] [get] an appeal _that_ says [it] _was_ [you know] an unjust amount _of time_ an extraordinary long length _or_ something . 
A|32| A: [time] [uh-huh .] _yes [._ _i] was_ _i would_ _just_ [be] _i would_ love _to _see_ them_ _just_ [really] [get] real strict [on] _parole_ [you know] . 
B|33| B: [yeah .] i'd [like] [to see] [the] death penalty _more_ _as_ [a] deterrent [i] _think_ _people_ [know] _that_ nobody _that_ [it] _doesn't_ [you know] [it's] [not] [a] deterrent [right] _now_ [because] [it's] [not] [really] effective . 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [there's] should [be] [you know] this [for] this crime this _is_ [the] penalty [. you] killed [someone] [you know] [in] _cold_ blood _or_ whatever . 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah [.] you] [get] [it] _back_ [yeah .] 
B|37| B: this _is_ what's [going to] happen . 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [and] [i mean] [it] sounds horrible _. it_ [i] hear myself [saying] this [and] _but_ [i] _don't know what_ [else] [to] do with [some] [of] these _people_ _that_ [are] 
A|40| A: [yeah _.] but_ [it's] _i [i_ know] . 
B|41| B: [because] [they] [let them] [back out] again [and] [they] do [the] _same thing_ over [and] over again 
A|42| A: [same thing] _yes ._ 
B|43| B: then [they] put [them] [back] [in] jail [and] [they] [get] [out] [and] [and] _more_ [and] _more_ [innocent] _people_ [are] hurt _or_ killed 
A|44| A: _yes ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and] these guys [just] [are] [on the] endless merry-go-round _in the_ legal system . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] [it's] _like i said_ [at] our expense . 
A|48| A: _uh_ _a lot of_ [people] [really] [doesn't] [think] [that] much _about it_ [because] [it] hasn't happened [to] [them] which [it] hasn't [to] me [either] _you know ?_ 
B|49| B: [yes .] 
A|50| A: thank goodness _. but_ _still_ [it] _could_ . 
B|51| B: [i _know] i_ _you read_ [about it] _in _the_ paper_ every day [somebody] who's done this _or_ [that] something [really] horrible 
A|52| A: [yes .] [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and] [they] [just] [get] away with [it] [and] nothing happens . 
A|54| A: _and as_ far [as] [the] _other_ _states_ [i] honestly [don't know what] their [capital] [punishment] [is] _. _you know_ i i_ haven't kept _up you know_ _anything_ [like] [that] . 
B|55| B: [yeah [.] i] [think] [i] [think] texas [is] texas [the] southern [states] [seem] [to] [be] somewhat _more_ conservative [and] [still] have [the] death penalty [and] [i] [think] [i know] california had [it] [for] [a] long [time and] then [they] [uh] took [it] off [the] books [they] repealed [it] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [and] [people] [like] charles manson [and] [and] [some] [of] these [other] [people] who were sentenced [to] death [at] [the] [time] [they] repealed [the] death penalty were sentenced [to] life [in] [prison] [and] [are] _now_ _now_ [that] _even_ _though_ california [has] reinstated [the] death penalty [for] whatever various crimes _. the_ [people] who were [there] originally [when they] [when they] _changed_ [the] laws [to] revoke [the] death penalty [are] [still] [in] [there] [for] [are] [in] [prison] [in] quote [for] life [and] [and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] [parole] [some] [of] [them] [like] manson who's come [up you know] 
A|58| A: [uh] . [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [it's] been denied fortunately [but] 
A|60| A: [yes _.] but_ [still] [it] came [up] [though] [didn't] [it] 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [i mean] [you know] 
B|63| B: [well] [the] jury [that] sentenced him sentenced him [to] death 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] [his] thousandth [and] one appeal [the] state [of] california revoked [the] law _in the_ early seventies [and] then [they] reinstated [it] later [but] [the] penalty [didn't] [go] [back] [. you know ?] 
A|66| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [it seems like] [a lot of] times [the] law [is] [is] totally [on the] criminal side [and] [and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
A|68| A: [yes [.] the] victim [is] [really] [seems like] left [out] [in the] [cold] [more] [or] [less] [doesn't] [it] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [in [a] lot of] [well] especially [in] [things] [you] pick [up] [the paper] [and] [you read] [you know] [you] [think] oh _my_ goodness 
B|71| B: [yeah .] [and] [the] [the] laws [are] [all] [the] rules . [some] [of] [the] [things] [that] [would] _make sense_ [to] [to] tell [the] jury [that] this this guy [has] [a] [a] prior criminal history [you know] where [he's] raped ten women 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] this one trial [and] [they] [don't] finds [anything] [out] [about] [the] facts [that] [he's] done this over [and] over [and] over again 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [so] [they] [say] [well] this [is] [you know i i] [don't know] [if] [they] [say] [it's] [the] first [time] offense [or] whatever [but] [they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] thinking [he's] [not] [a] habitual criminal . 
A|76| A: [or] [you know] _plead insanity_ . 
B|77| B: [yeah] [yeah _.] well_ [to] [some] extent [if] [they] [would] do something with [some] [of] those [people] [. but] [that] [seems] [to] [be] [a] good way [to] [get] off [for] [a lot of] [them] too . 
A|78| A: oh [yes] 
B|79| B: [they] [plead insanity] 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [and] then three [years] later they're cured [and] [let] loose [on] society again . 
A|82| A: [yes [.] i] [it] [just] [just] [doesn't] [make sense] 
B|83| B: [i mean] [it's a] [it's a] scary world [out] [there] anymore where [your] afraid [to] [go] [out] 
A|84| A: [i] 
B|85| B: [i know] [in] [in the] dallas metroplex area [i] [don't] [go] [out] hardly [if] [i] [don't] have [to] [at] night by myself 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [and] [i i] certainly [i i] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] texas [and] [it] wasn't [that] way _when i was_ younger . 
A|88| A: [uh-huh [.] well] [like i said] [i] live [in a] small place [. you know] . 
B|89| B: we [could] [go] around [and] boy [and] 
A|90| A: [but] [uh] [even] [the] small towns [now] [though] [has] [really] [changed] from _when i was a kid_ [but] [now] i'm raising children [. it] [it] [really] [is] . 
B|91| B: [yes .] ever [you] can't [even] [when i was a kid] [i would] _run_ between [my] neighbors three [and] four blocks sometimes [and as] long [as] [my] mom had [a] general idea where [i was] [and] [i was] [back] [on the] [time] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [and] [now] [i] [don't] [let] [my] kids _out of_ [the] front yard [that] [i] can't _see them ._ 
A|94| A: [see them .] [yeah .] [yeah [.] it] [really] [is] [. well] we're probably fixing [to] [run] [out [of] time] pretty soon 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [but] i've enjoyed _talking to you_ . 
B|97| B: [well] good [talking to you] too . _bye_ 
A|98| A: [bye]
