B|33| B: [yeah .] i'd [like] [to see] [the] death penalty _more_ _as_ [a] deterrent [, i] _think_ _people_ [know] _that_ nobody , _that_ [it] _doesn't_ _, you know ,_ [it's] [not] [a] deterrent [right] _now_ _, because_ [it's] [not] [really] effective .

B|39| B: [and] [, [i] mean [,] it] sounds horrible _. [it_ [,] i] hear myself [saying] this [, and] _, _but_ _,_ i ,_ _don't know what_ [else] [to] do with [some] [of] these _people_ , _that_ [are] , 
A|40| A: [yeah _.] but_ [it's _,] i _, i_ know_ . 
B|41| B: [because] [they] [let them] [back out] again [, and] [they] do [the] _same thing_ over [, and] over , again , 
A|42| A: [same thing] , _yes ._ 
B|43| B: then [they] put [them] [back] [in] jail [, and] [they] [get] [out] [, and] [and] _more_ [and] _more_ [innocent] _people_ [are] hurt _or_ killed 
A|44| A: _yes ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and] these guys [just] [are] [on the] endless merry-go-round _in the_ legal system . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] [it's] _like i_ _said_ [at] our expense . 
A|48| A: _uh _,_ _a_ lot of_ [people] [really] [doesn't] [think] [that] much _about [it_ [,] because] [it] hasn't happened [to] _them ,_ which [it] hasn't [to] me [either] [, _you know] ?_ 
B|49| B: [yes .] 
A|50| A: thank goodness _. but_ _still_ [, it] _could_ . 
B|51| B: [i _know] , i [,_ _you] read_ [about it] _in _the_ paper ,_ every day , [somebody] who's done this , _or_ [that] , something [really] horrible 
A|52| A: [yes .] [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [and] [they] [just] [get] away with [it [,] and] nothing happens . 
A|54| A: [and] [as] far [as] [the] _other_ _states_ [, i] honestly [don't know what] their [capital] [punishment] [is] _. _you know_ , i [, i_ ,] haven't kept [up] [, you know ,] _anything_ _, like_ [that] . 
B|55| B: [yeah [.] i] [think] [i] [think] texas [is] texas , [the] southern [states] [seem] [to] [be] somewhat _more_ conservative [and] [still] have [the] death penalty [, and] [i] _think [,_ i know] california had [it] [for] [a] long [time , and] then [they] _, uh ,_ took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [and] [people] [like] charles manson [, and] [, and] [some] [of] these [other] [people] , who were sentenced [to] death [at] [the] [time] [they] repealed [the] death penalty , were sentenced [to] life [in] [prison [,] and] [are] _now_ , _now_ [that] _even_ _though_ california [has] reinstated [the] death penalty [, for] whatever various crimes _. the_ [people] who were [there] originally , [when they] , [when they] _changed_ [the] laws [to] revoke [the] death penalty , [are] [still] [in] [there] [for] , [are] [in] [prison ,] [in] quote [, for] life [, and] [, and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] [parole] [, some] [of] [them [,] like] manson who's come [up] [you know] 
A|58| A: [uh] . [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [it's] been denied fortunately _but ,_ 
A|60| A: [yes _.] but_ [still] [, it] came [up] [though] , [didn't] [it ,] 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [i mean [,] you know] 
B|63| B: [well ,] [the] jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him [to] death 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] [his] thousandth [and] one appeal , [the] state [of] california revoked [the] law _in the_ early seventies [, and] then [they] reinstated [it] later _, but_ [the] penalty [didn't] [go] [back] [. you know ?] 
A|66| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [it seems like] [a lot of] times [the] law [is] , [is] totally [on the] criminal side [, and] [, and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
A|68| A: [yes [.] the] victim [is] [really] , [seems like] left [out] [in the] [cold] , [more] [or] [less] , [doesn't] [it ,] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [in [a] lot of] [, well ,] especially [in] [things] [, you] pick [up] [the paper [,] and] [you read] [, you know [,] you] [think ,] oh _my_ goodness 
B|71| B: [yeah .] [and] [the] , [the] laws [are] [all] , [the] rules . [some] [of] [the] [things] [that] [would] _make sense_ [to] , [to] tell [the] jury , [that] this , this guy [has] [a] [, a] prior criminal history [, you know ,] where [he's] raped ten women 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] this one trial [, and] [they] [don't] finds [anything] [out] [about] [the] facts [that] [he's] done this over [and] over [and] over again 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [so] [they] [say] [, well ,] this [is] [, [you know ,] i , i] [don't know] [if] [they] [say] [it's] [the] first [time] offense [or] whatever _, but_ [they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] , thinking [he's] [not] [a] habitual criminal . 
A|76| A: [or] [, you know ,] _plead insanity_ . 
B|77| B: [yeah] [, yeah _.] well ,_ [to] [some] extent [if] [they] [would] do something with [some] [of] those [people] [. but] [that] [seems] [to] [be] [a] good way [to] [get] off [for] [a lot of] [them] too . 
A|78| A: oh [yes] , 
B|79| B: [they] [plead insanity] 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [and] then three [years] later they're cured [, and] [let] loose [on] society again . 
A|82| A: [yes [.] [i] [,] it] [just] , [just] [doesn't] [make sense] , 
B|83| B: [i mean ,] [it's a] [it's a] scary world [out] [there] anymore , where [your] afraid [to] [go] [out] , 
A|84| A: [i ,] 
B|85| B: [i [know] ,] [in] , [in the] dallas metroplex area [, i] [don't] [go] [out] hardly [if] [i] [don't] have [to] [at] night by myself 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [and] [i , i] certainly [, i , i] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way _when i was_ younger . 
A|88| A: [uh-huh [.] well [,] [like] [i] ,] [said] [, i] live [in a] small place [. you know] . 
B|89| B: we [could] [go] around [, and] , boy [and] ,

B|91| B: [yes .] ever [, you] can't [even] , [when i was a kid [,] i would] _run_ between [my] neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and] , [as] long [as] [my] mom had [a] general idea where [i was] [and] [i was] [back] [on the] [time ,] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .]

A|94| A: [see them .] [yeah .] [yeah [.] it] [really] [is] [. well ,] we're probably fixing [to] [run] [out [of] time] pretty , soon , 
B|95| B: [uh-huh .]
