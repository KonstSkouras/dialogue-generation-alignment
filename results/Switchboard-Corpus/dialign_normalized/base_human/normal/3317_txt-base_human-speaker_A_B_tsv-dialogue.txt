A|0| A: okay , _what_ kind _of_ _house_ _do_ _you_ _live in_ ? 
B|1| B: _well _,_ uh ,_ _we_ [live in] _a_ _, a_ brick _home_ [in] far north dallas _and_ _it's_ _, uh ,_ _four bedrooms and_ _three_ _and a half_ baths _and_ _swimming pool_ _in the_ _back_ _and ,_ _it's_ _about_ thirty-five _hundred square_ feet . 
A|2| A: _uh-huh . well _,_ it_ _sounds like_ ours _are_ pretty _similar_ _. i_ [live in] _one_ _, i_ _don't_ _have a_ [swimming pool] _. and_ mine's [about] twenty-seven [hundred square] foot . 
B|3| B: yeah . 
A|4| A: _but_ [the] [four bedrooms and] _all the_ rest _of it_ _sounds_ _just_ [about] [about] alike _. i_ think [it's] pretty much typical _for_ _this_ _area_ . 
B|5| B: [it] _is ._ [have] [you] _been_ living there very long ? 
A|6| A: _i've_ [been] [in _the] house_ i'm [in] _here_ _right_ _now_ [about] twelve _and a half years_ . 
B|7| B: _so_ you've [been] there longer . _we_ built [this] [one] [about] _, uh ,_ [it's] [been] let's see [it's] [been] six [years] six [and a half years] ago , 
A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: [and] _we_ subcontracted [it] _out_ ourselves . _we_ bought [the] _lot_ _and , uh ,_ _had_ an architect draw [the] plans based _on_ our _specifications_ 
A|10| A: _oh ,_ _really_ ? _uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: _and then we_ subbed [it] _out_ _, so_ _, we've_ _been here_ [a] _little_ over six [years] [now] [. and] _uh ,_ [have] [really] _enjoyed_ [it] _because_ _we_ built [what] _we_ wanted _to _have_ to_ [live in] . 
A|12| A: _uh-huh . _well ,_ i_ bet [you] _, _uh-huh_ ._ 
B|13| B: _my_ husband _got_ _his_ _big_ _garage ._ _he_ _we _have_ a three _car garage_ _,_ that_ _he has a big work_ [area] [in] 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [and] _he likes to_ rebuild _cars_ [and] redo engines _and _,_ so_ _he has_ [all the] _work_ _space_ _he_ needs . 
A|16| A: [well [,] that] _sounds_ interesting _. i_ bet _he's_ [enjoyed] having [it] [that] way 
B|17| B: _he_ , 
A|18| A: [because] kind _of_ hard [to] find [one] prebuilt [that] 's kind _of_ fits those [specifications] . 
B|19| B: [it] _is_ _, and_ _that's_ why _we_ decided [to] build . _we_ looked _at_ _things_ [that] _were_ _already_ _, uh ,_ built 
A|20| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|21| B: _and the_ garages _were_ always , if [the house] _was_ large [, it] seemed [like] [the] garages _were_ small even if _they_ _were_ _three car_ garages which _is_ [what] _we _have_ ._ 
A|22| A: [well ,] [then] , most _of_ _them_ _don't_ [have a three car [garage] .] 
B|23| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: they're kind _of_ rare . 
B|25| B: _so_ _we_ _put_ [a three car garage] [in] . 
A|26| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: _but ,_ even if _they_ _had_ [three car] garages _, they_ _didn't_ [have a] _work_ _space_ . _all [of_ it] _was_ taken _up with_ [just] [car] _space_ . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [and] _so_ _he has a big_ landing [area] _that's_ _between_ _where the cars are_ [in the] [garage] [and] _where [the_ house] starts [that] _he_ can _work on_ . 
A|30| A: _uh-huh . well_ [that] _, my_ [, we've] [just] [got] [a] two [car garage _,] but_ _my husband's_ [got] [a big] [space] [in] [between] [the] , [where the cars are] [and [the] house] , [where] [he has a big work] shop , [you] know , workbench [and] everything . 
B|31| B: [well ,] [sounds like] our husbands [have] [similar] interests . 
A|32| A: [now] , mine does _not_ [work on] [cars] , [he] [just] piddles [on] [this] [and] _that ._ 
B|33| B: [oh [,] i] see . 
A|34| A: [but] [he likes [to] [have] a] spot [to] keep [all of] [his] , [his] piddling [things] . 
B|35| B: [uh-huh . well ,] _that's_ _nice_ [that] [it's] [not] [in] _your house_ . 
A|36| A: [it] [really] [is .] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [because] , [you] know [, they] [have a] [lot] [of] [things] [of] their own [, and] [i] , [you] know [, i] wouldn't mind having [, and] [i] [at] [one] time [was] _going_ [to] fix [up] when [one] [of] [my] daughters left [, _a] bedroom_ [to] [where] [i] [had] [a] _room_ [to] [just] [put] [all of] [my] craft stuff [and] sewing machine [and] [all] [that] kind [of] stuff , 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [but] [i] , someone [, i] _don't_ know [, it] ended [up] [i] [got] some furniture [back] [that] [one] [of] _them_ [had] moved [out] _or_ something . 
B|41| B: [right] . 
A|42| A: [so] [i] [didn't] end [up with] [my] vacant _room_ [like] [i] [had] thought [i] would . 
B|43| B: [well ,] _we_ _still [have_ a] [, a] son [and] daughter [in] college [that] _come_ _home_ . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and the] other [room] _we_ use as [a] guest [bedroom] [because] [my husband's] family _come_ . [his] parents _come_ [and] also [the] _kids_ [have] friends who _come_ [and] stay 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [and] [so] [it] seems [like] [it's] always used as [a bedroom] . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh . _well ,] i_ [still] , [all] [three] [of] [my] daughters [are] _married_ _, [but_ [,] i] _don't_ know [, i] [just] [still have] need _for_ [the] [four bedrooms] [just] having company from time [to] time [. and] some [of] _them_ coming [back] [home] [and] [things] , [you] know . 
B|49| B: [right] . [oh [,] i] understand 
A|50| A: [and] [we've] [got] _grandchildren_ [now] [, so] when [they] [come] [, they] [have [to] [have] a] place . 
B|51| B: [well ,] _we_ , _that's_ true [and] [you] [don't] want [them] [to] [not] _be_ able [to] [come] [because] _there's_ no [room] . 
A|52| A: [that's] [right] , [you] sure [don't] . [at] times [i] keep thinking , though [, that] might [be] kind [of] [nice] . 
B|53| B: [well , _i] _i_ haven't_ reached [that] point yet . [i've] heard people _say_ [that _.] but _,_ uh [,_ my] middle son [is] engaged [, my] oldest son [has] [been] [going] [with] _the same_ girl [for] [a] while . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [he's] [out] [of] college [and] [has a] good job , 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [so] [he] could afford _to get_ [married] [but ,] [is] [not] engaged yet , 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and] [my] daughter's [been] [going] [with] _the same_ boy [for] [a] while [, but] she's [still] [in] college [and] we're [just] as happy [for] her [to] finish her education first . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [that's] [what] she plans [to] [do] . 
A|62| A: [well , i] [don't] blame [you] [for] [that .] 
B|63| B: [so] [, i] hope [so] . 
A|64| A: [well , i] [have] [the] [three] girls [and then we] ended [up with] [four] grandsons . 
B|65| B: [oh ,] ho-ho . 
A|66| A: [and] [little] boys [are] around [the house] _a whole_ [lot] more than girls . 
B|67| B: [a whole] new world . [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [and , uh [,] i] enjoy [them] coming [, but] [for] short doses 
B|69| B: [i] can understand . 
A|70| A: [it] feels , after they've [been here] ten minutes [, they] [have] [already] explored [the] entire [house] [, they] know everything . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [but ,] they're fun . 
B|73| B: [so] you're [all] [back] [to] [the] safety catches [and the] [whole] nine yards [or] either watching [them] _every_ minute . 
A|74| A: [well , i] [just] watch [them] . 
B|75| B: yeah . 
A|76| A: [i i] never _did_ [put] [things] [up] when [my] [kids] [were] [little] [and] [i haven't] [with] [them] _. i_ try [to] teach [them] [not] [to get] into [things] . 
B|77| B: [well ,] [that's] _the same_ thing [that] [i] [did] [. i] hope i'll [be] able [to] [do] _the same_ [with] [grandchildren] . 
A|78| A: [i] think [that] once [you] [do] [that] , [your] children kind [of] develop [the same] attitudes . [at] least [my] daughters [have .] [they] try [to] teach theirs [not] [to get] into [things] instead [of] having [to] [put] everything [up] . [so] [it's] worked pretty [well] . [there's] [, i] [don't] [really] think anything's [been] broken . [every] [now] [and then [we] [have] to] kind [of] go [and] [say] , [now] [don't] bother [this] [you] know . 
B|79| B: um [, uh-huh] 
A|80| A: [but ,] [all] [in] [all] [, they] mind pretty [well] [. but [,] i] guess most [of] [the] [what] kind [of] roof does [your house] [have] ? [here] i'm getting off [the] subject .
