A|5| A: [right] _as a_ matter _of_ fact _i was_ thinking _that_ same _thing_ [unconditional] love . _they_ _just_ give _it_ _and_ _don't_ expect too much . 
B|6| B: _yeah ._ 
A|7| A: anyway _do_ _you _have_ a pet_ ?

B|10| B: _i'm_ _going to get another one_ [as] soon [as] [i] _get_ back in town . _i'm_ _going_ out [of] town _this_ weekend [when i] _get_ back _i'm_ _going to_ find [a] _cat _._ so_

B|12| B: _yeah ._ 
A|13| A: [i] _know_ some [of] [my] friends who [have] pets [uh] _and they_ _just_ _are_ _really_ _you know the_ ones _that_ [have] _dogs_ _are_ very [uh] protective _of _them_ _and_ i think_ [that's] [one] reason _they_ [have] _them_ especially older _people that_ [i] _know_ _that_ [have] pets . [but] _they_ _just_ um _really_ _take care _of_ them_ _or_ [uh] _are_ protective _of them ._ 
B|14| B: [i] work [and] go [to] school [and] _it's_ _kind of_ nice [you] come home _your_ _your_ pet's there _for_ [you] [and] wants [a] little food [a] little attention . 
A|15| A: [yeah] _an_ [and] [my] [my] _kids_ 
B|16| B: _and that's_ _it's_ _kind of_ _fun_ . 
A|17| A: um _they_ _really_ _want_ [a] _dog_ badly [and] they've been looking [and] looking [and] _want_ _you know_ they'd _take_ _anything_ _i think_ 
B|18| B: _yeah ._ 
A|19| A: [but] um _i don't_ _know_ _do_ [you] [like] [i] guess [your] _cat _was_ an_ _indoor_ [cat .] 
B|20| B: [no] _it was an_ _kind of_ [indoor] _outdoor_ _it it was_ 
A|21| A: [it] [kind of] traveled around travel . 
B|22| B: _well_ _yeah [i_ don't] [i don't] [care] _for_ [the] smell [of] [the] litter box [so] [my] [cat was] trained [to] go outside other than [that] _it was_ inside [when] [it] wanted [to] _be_ _it was_ outside [when] . 
A|23| A: [yeah] [when [i] had a] cocker spaniel [it [it was] an] [outdoor] _dog_ _and uh_ _i think_ [i] liked [that] better . 
B|24| B: _yeah i_ [i think] [you know] [i] [like] [dogs] _but [i_ think] [that] [uh] _i'm kind of_ [like] big big _dogs and_ [you _have] to_ [have] room _for_ [them .] 
A|25| A: [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|26| B: [and] [dogs] [take] [a lot of] _a lot more_ [care] than cats [do] . cats [are] pretty independent [you know] [you] feed [them [and] they] keep themselves clean [and] _if you_ _if you_ raise [them] [right] [you know] [you] [don't] _have to_ worry [about] [the] litter box [thing] where _with_ [dogs] [you] [really] [do] _have to_ let [them] out [and] _take them for walks_ [and] things [like] [that] . 
A|27| A: [yeah] [that's] true . [take them for walks] [right] . [yeah i] see all [the] _people_ _on_ _on_ sunday [going] [for] [a] walk [with] their [dogs _and] and i_ [i'm kind of] skeptical [with] [my] son _getting_ [a] _dog_ [i'm] [like] [i] [know] [it] will [be] [fun] [the] first week maybe 
B|28| B: _yeah ._

A|31| A: oh [that's] exciting . [yeah .] 
B|32| B: [and uh] [kids] [kind of] [they] [want] [the] [they] [want] [the] [fun] part [and] _not_ [the] _not_ [the] work . 
A|33| A: [yeah [i] think] [it's] [really] important [to] [that] [that] [if you] [get] [a pet] [that] _they're_ either _spayed_ _or_ _neutered_ [so] [that] [you know] we're [not] [just] [going] _on_ [with] [this] [pet] population [and] having [to] [just] _get rid of them ._ 
B|34| B: [yeah .] 
A|35| A: [that] [that] [kind of] gripes _on_ me some [but] [but [i] don't] [know] . 
B|36| B: _well_ [if] [you're] [if] [you're going to] [have a pet] [and] [not] [have] [it] [neutered] [or] [spayed] [you] need [to] [be] willing [to] [you know] deal [with] [the] consequences [take care of] [the] offspring 
A|37| A: [more] [and] [more] _people_ [are] [right] [right] . 
B|38| B: [and [and i] think] [you know] 
A|39| A: [but uh] 
B|40| B: [when i was] growing up we [had] cats [and] [you know] [just] seeing [the] cats [you know the] [the] miracle [of] birth [you know] put [that] in quotes [is] [that's] [a] [that's] [a] neat [thing] [to] [to] experience [as a] kid [and] understand 
A|41| A: [i think] [that's] [really] true . 
B|42| B: [and and] [it [was] a] real positive [thing] [but] [on] [the] other hand [you] [don't] [want] [to] you'd [be] [one] [of] these [people that] dumps [the] kittens off [on] [the] side [of] [the] road [you know] 
A|43| A: [yeah .] 
B|44| B: [they're] [they're] [getting] old _now_ [and] [it's] time [to [get] rid of them .] 
A|45| A: [yeah] exactly . 
B|46| B: [so] .
