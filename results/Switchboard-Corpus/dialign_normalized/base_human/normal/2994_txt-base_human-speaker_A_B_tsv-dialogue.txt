A|2| A: _uh-huh_ _, uh [,_ _we] , we_ _have_ [a] pretty nice _recycling_ center _, uh ,_ _in_ [our] city _now_ [and we take] _the_ [newspapers and] plastic [and] glass _up_ there . _they're_ open [like] _two_ days [a] week [and] _you_ _can_ _just_ [take] _it_ _up_ there [and] drop _it off ._ 
B|3| B: _uh-huh ._

B|5| B: _yeah [._ and] _a lot of_ _people_ complain _because_ [it's] _really_ _not_ convenient _for them ._ 
A|6| A: [yeah .] [yeah] my husband _was_ complaining _the_ other day [because] he _said_ every _time_ _i_ turn around _you're_ telling me _some_ new rule _about_ _recycling_ [like] yesterday _i_ _was_ tell him _, you_ _have _to_ ,_ _you're supposed to_ squeeze _the_ plastic jugs before _you_ [take them] _up_ there . 
B|7| B: [you're supposed to] _what_ . 
A|8| A: every _time_ he turns around i'm giving him _some_ new rule _, where_ [you're supposed to] squish _up_ _the _,_ you know ,_ [like] collapse _the_ plastic jugs . instead [of] taking [them] _up_ there solid . 
B|9| B: _but_ _what_ _are_ [you] [supposed _to] do_ [with] _them ._ oh , [okay] . 
A|10| A: _and i_ wish [that] [our] _recycling_ center took paper bags . _they_ won't [take] _those_ [. we] [like] [to] put [our] , _just_ put [our newspapers] _in_ [a] paper bag _, you know [,_ _and] then_ carry [them] _up_ there [that] _way_ . 
B|11| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: [and we] _have to_ bring _the_ paper bags back every _time_ . [because] _they_ won't [take [them] .] 
B|13| B: [yeah .] 
A|14| A: _do _you_ _,_ uh _,_ take_ _your_ papers somewhere or does someone pick [them] _up_ ? 
B|15| B: [we , we] usually collect [a] [, you know ,] collect [a] quite [a] bit [and then] [we [take] them] [, [take] them] [in] . 
A|16| A: [uh-huh [.] [we] _,] um _,_ we don't_ [take] [our] _cans_ _up_ [to] [that] center , though , [our] _aluminum cans [,_ we] [like] [to] [take them to] one [of] _the_ places _where_ _they_ _pay_ [you] [for them .] 
B|17| B: _yeah [,_ we _don't] [,_ we _don't] [,_ um ,] use [aluminum cans ,] 
A|18| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: _so_ [, we] generally [don't] [have] [those] _to do_ . 
A|20| A: [yeah ,] _it_ takes us _about_ [a] year [to] save _up_ enough [to be] worth [, you know ,] worth bothering [to] go [in] [and] [do] , [but] . _do _you_ [,_ um ,] [have] any ideas on anything [that] _would make_ , 
B|21| B: [you know ,] [they] , [they] charge [you [,] you know ,] [it's] [like] [a] flat rate _i think_ [for] picking [up] _your garbage_ . 
A|22| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: [and i] [know] _a lot of_ _people_ [it] [would] , [would] solve [the] convenience problem _if they_ had _curbside pickup_ [and] [some] communities _are_ _trying _to_ _do_ that_ [now] [. [and] _i] think that_ maybe _if they_ only charged [for] [the] _garbage_ [that] [you] did _not_ sort [and] [have] set [up] _for recycling_ , 
A|24| A: _right_ . 
B|25| B: [they] , [they] charged [you] by , by weight [of] _how much_ trash [you] _were_ actually sending [to] [a] land fill . 
A|26| A: [yeah] [that] _would _be_ a_ good idea . 
B|27| B: [that] [that] might [be a] better [way] _to do_ _it ._ 
A|28| A: [yeah .] 
B|29| B: [and then] _people_ [would] , [would] [know] [that] _it was going to_ cost [them] _money_ [to] _not_ sort [their] trash . 
A|30| A: _right_ . [yeah ,] [that] _would [be_ a] real good motivation [for] [people] . 
B|31| B: [you know ,] [because] [then] [it] [would] , [then] [it] [would make] monetary sense [to] [them] [, you know ,] [to] say , hey [, you know ,] _if_ [i] [just] spend [the] [time] [to ,] [to] sort this out [where] this [stuff] [can] [be] recycled [then] _i don't_ _have to pay [for_ them] hauling [it off .] 
A|32| A: _right_ . [yeah ,] my father [was] telling me _about_ [some] program he read _about_ [where] [you] _buy_ [your] bags , [like] [you] _buy_ [your garbage] bag from [the] city , 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [and] [you] [pay] more than [just] [what] [you] [would] [pay for] an empty [garbage] bag [but] [then] [you] [don't] [pay] any monthly fee or anything , [so] [how] ever many bags [of] [garbage] [you] throw away _, that's_ [how] many [you] [have to pay for] . 
B|35| B: oh , [yeah] [that's] [about] [the] same [kind of] thing . 
A|36| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [that] _would [be_ a] real good idea . i'm [trying to] [think] [if] there's anything else [i] could [think] [of] . [they] [are] talking [about] [going to] [curbside pickup] [in] [our] , [in] [our] city . 
B|37| B: [where] [do you] live ? 
A|38| A: rowlett , texas . 
B|39| B: oh , [okay] . 
A|40| A: [do [you] know] [where] [that] is ? 
B|41| B: yes . 
A|42| A: [and [i] don't] [know] [if they] decided [to do] , or [not] , [but] [i think] [they] _said_ [it was going to] add [like] either [a] dollar or three dollars [a] month [to] [your] bill [to] [have] [them] [do that] . although , [i think] [a lot of] [those] programs [can] operate at [about] [a] break even , break even point , without charging [people] . 
B|43| B: [it] seems [like] [they] [would be] able [to] . 
A|44| A: [yeah] [i don't] [know _,] uh ,_ [i] guess [it] [just] depends on [how] [they] manage [it .] 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [i don't] [know] [how much] [they] get when [they] sell _all_ [that] [stuff] . [the] center [that] they've got [now] [where] [you] [take] [your] [stuff] [in] [i] , [i think that] should [be] making [some] [money] . since [they] [just] [have to] hire someone [to] man [it] [a] few hours [a] week . 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: [and] [they] sell , [i] guess [they] sell everything [to] [some] waste company [that] comes [and] gets [it .] 
B|49| B: [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [but] [i] wish _that _,_ uh ,_ more [of] [the] [cans [,] you know ,] [like] [the] [cans] [you] _buy_ vegetables [and] fruit [and stuff like that] [in] [were] recyclable . [i [don't] ,] [a lot of] [that's] [that] recyclable steel [and [i] don't] [know] anybody [that] takes [that] . 
B|51| B: _yeah , that's_ true . 
A|52| A: my husband likes pepsi [and] [those] [cans] [are] steel instead [of] [aluminum] , [so] [we] can't , can't ever recycle [them .] [i think] [it's] [a] good reason [to] quit buying [it .] 
B|53| B: [um ,] [now] [i] didn't [know] [that ,] cause [we] [just] usually [if] _we're [going_ [to] [,] uh ,] [buy] sodas [they're] [in] [the ,] [the] [two] liter bottles . 
A|54| A: [yeah , that's] [what] [we] [buy] [the] most [of] , unless [we're going] on [a] trip or something [where] [we] want [to ,] put [the] [cans] [in] [a] cooler 
B|55| B: [yeah .]
