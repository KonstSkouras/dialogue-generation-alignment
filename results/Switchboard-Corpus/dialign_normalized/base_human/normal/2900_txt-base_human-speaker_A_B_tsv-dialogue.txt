A|0| A: uh _i_ guess _my_ feelings are _that_ uh we almost _have_ _a_ universal health _care_ system uh _to_ _a_ great degree except _that_ _now_ _i_ read where we've left _out_ about thirty-four million _people_ . 
B|1| B: oh . 
A|2| A: _and_ uh _i don't know_ exactly _how_ we're _going to_ cover _many_ _of_ these _people_ _because_ i'm sure _that_ some _of_ them _don't_ uh _don't have the_ wherewithal _to_ _do_ _it_ themselves _so_ uh _i_ _i_ _have_ _a_ feeling since _i_ _have_ _just_ about as _good_ _a_ health _care_ coverage _that_ anybody can _get_ _that_ _this_ uh _then_ _becomes_ an obligation _of _the_ government_ _because_ _it's_ _going to_ become an obligation _of_ either state local _or_ federal _government_ anyway . 
B|3| B: yeah _because when_ [people] can't _pay_ _they_ end _up_ [going to] clinics [or] _you know_ [to] public _hospitals_ [and] [that] kind [of] thing [and] _you know_ 
A|4| A: _well_ _it_ seems [to] me [that] [that] i'm paying anyway [because _when] i_ _go_ [or] _my_ insurance carrier anyway _when i_ [pay] something _the_ bills seem inordinately high . 
B|5| B: oh definitely . 
A|6| A: [and] _the_ reason [that] _they're_ inordinately high _is_ [because] [that] has [to] cover _the_ costs for _the_ indigent _people who_ apparently _don't have the money_ [or] _the_ wherewithal [to] _do_ [that] . 
B|7| B: _right_ . yeah yeah . 
A|8| A: _it_ _would_ seem [to] spread _it_ _out_ _a_ little better _if_ _the_ employers _who_ uh employ these [people] [and] [pay] them uh [you know] subminimum wages [or] whatever were asked [to] share their fair _burden_ [of] _this_ too _just_ as _my_ employer _is_ . 
B|9| B: yeah . yeah yeah . 
A|10| A: [and] myself _i_ guess . 
B|11| B: yeah [that] sounds _like_ [a] [good] idea _. my_ only concern [is] _what happens_ [when] [you] turn things over [to] [the government] [i don't know] 
A|12| A: _well_ _well_ _who_ _who_ else [is] [going to] _do_ _this_ _then ?_ 
B|13| B: [do] _they_ wind _up_ _with_ more red tape [and] more problems [then ?] yeah yeah . 
A|14| A: _i mean_ _it's_ worked successfully _in_ europe . 
B|15| B: uh-huh . 
A|16| A: i've heard all these stories about [i] travel extensively [and] spend uh maybe half [a] year _in_ europe _every_ year 
B|17| B: oh . 
A|18| A: _and i_ find [that] [the] health _care_ programs there uh are administered [with] uh at least [people] [i] talk [to] [with] uh [a] great _deal_ [of] integrity [and] uh _people don't_ seem [to] _be_ reluctant [to] use them [to] any degree . 
B|19| B: yeah . 
A|20| A: as [a] matter [of] fact _if_ i'm injured [or] _have_ an emergency [when] i'm say _in_ germany [or] france uh [that] i'm automatically taken _care_ [of] 
B|21| B: wow . 
A|22| A: _i mean_ [i _don't] even_ _have_ [to] [pay] . 
B|23| B: yeah . _well _i_ think_ part [of the] [the] tremendous benefit [of] [that] [is] [that] there's [so] [many] [people who] wait [now] [because] _they_ [don't have the money] until [you know] _they_ [have] no preventative measures [people] _um_ [you know] [just] [go] _on_ [and] _on_ [and] _on_ . [i mean] [so] [many] [people [don't] even] [get] _prenatal care_ [or] [and] [it] [just] extends [with] [if] [it] _what_ [would] [be] [a] minor problem [to] [deal] [with] [if] _they_ had [a] help available early _on_ [becomes] [just] [this] horrendous [you know] [burden] _on_ [the] taxpayers . [they're] saying [now] [that] one [out] [of] [every] ten child born [in] public _hospitals_ [is] addicted [to] crack . 
A|24| A: [well i] uh uh [i] [know] [it] . 
B|25| B: [well] [you know] 
A|26| A: [i] [have] [a] solution [you] _see_ [. my] solution [even] though i'm rapidly approaching [the] uh [the] age [when] i'll qualify for medicare [and] medicaid [i] [i] [my] mother [and] father both uh uh [well] [my] father's not living but [my] mother [is] 
B|27| B: uh-huh . 
A|28| A: _and they_ are [um] [of] an advanced years [and] _when _i_ see_ [the money] that's poured down [the] down [the] drain [on] medicare [and] medicaid [i mean] [the] absolute uncontrollable situation [that] we find ourselves [in] 
B|29| B: yeah . 
A|30| A: [and] [the] extraordinary amounts [i] [know] [that] [because] those [people] vote [i mean] [they're] [the] ones [who] [get] [out] [and] vote that's what's robbing [a] poor mother [of the] [prenatal care] . [the] young [people] aren't getting [the] proper [care] [that] [they] need [and] nutrition [i think] 
B|31| B: yeah yeah . 
A|32| A: [and] we're spending [on] these useless [many] times useless [and] inordinately complex unnecessary tests [in] [hospitals] for older [people] . 
B|33| B: oh [it's] unbelievable [how] much [you] [go] through . [when i] [just] had [a] problem [with] [my] neck [and they] ended _up_ doing [a] seven hundred dollar cat scan [and [i] mean] [a] chiropractor got [it] [in] one _time_ 
A|34| A: that's [right] [i mean] [it] does seem [like] we're 
B|35| B: [it] _was just_ strange . 
A|36| A: [now] [i] noticed [just] [the] other day [in] [the] paper [that] [that] medicare will [be] based payments will [be] based not uh [just] [on] cost but [on] cost effectiveness . [so] [i] 
B|37| B: oh [well] [that] should help . 
A|38| A: [well [i] don't know] uh we'll _see_ [how] [that] goes . 
B|39| B: yeah 
A|40| A: [i think] [that] [was just] [a] regulation [that] [was] [up] for comment but we'll _see_ [what happens] . 
B|41| B: oh [i see] oh gosh . 
A|42| A: [well] listen uh [i think] i've i've exhausted [my] uh self [on] at least i've blown off steam [of the] way [i] feel about [it] . 
B|43| B: _okay_ [well] 
A|44| A: [okay] ? 
B|45| B: [okay] thank [you] . bye-bye
