B|1| B: _yes_ . 
A|2| A: _okay_ 
B|3| B: _have_ [you] recently _bought_ _a_ new _car_ catherine ? 
A|4| A: _well _i_ just_ found _out_ _that_ _my_ [car] _like_ _an_ _old_ _was_ thirty _months_ _old_ _and it_ _doesn't_ seem _like_ _it's_ _that_ _old_ . 
B|5| B: _oh ._ 
A|6| A: _seems like_ _i just_ _bought _it_ ._ 
B|7| B: _oh_ _wow ._ 
A|8| A: _it's_ _an_ eighty-nine _and i_ _bought it_ _uh_ _in_ _uh_ eighty-eight _so_ _yeah ._ 
B|9| B: [well _i] really_ _the_ last [car] we _got_ [was] _a_ [was] _a_ used _car ._ _i really_ _don't_ prefer buying _a_ new _car ._ _i _like_ to_ let somebody else pay _for_ [that] 
A|10| A: [i] _know [i_ really] _will_ _do_ [that] [the] next _time i_ _buy_ _it_ _too ._ 
B|11| B: _but_ [uh] mine [was] _a_ year [old] 
A|12| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: [and] we [bought it] _for_ very functional purposes 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [and] _that was_ we [bought] _a_ station wagon . we _wanted_ [an] economical [car] [to] operate 
A|16| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _but_ we _wanted_ _one_ [that] could carry _a lot of_ equipment . [so] we chose _a_ nissan stanza wagon . 
A|18| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|19| B: [and] _i've_ _never_ been _sorry_ 
A|20| A: [oh] _that's_ wonderful . 
B|21| B: however [the] need _for_ [that] kind _of_ [car] has changed _now_ 
A|22| A: _uh-huh _._ oh_ _okay ._ 
B|23| B: [and] [uh] while _it is_ still good _and it's_ quite serviceable [and] i'll drive [it] until [it] _no_ longer _is_ reliable . 
A|24| A: _uh-huh ._ huh . 
B|25| B: [and] _probably_ then some i'll spend _a lot of_ [time] praying over [it] before [i] give [it] _up ._ 
A|26| A: _sure_ . 
B|27| B: _i think_ [that] _i would_ _like to_ _if_ _you know_ we _all_ say _if i_ could _have_ _the car i_ always _wanted_ _i would_ either [buy] _a_ nissan maxima [uh] 
A|28| A: right . 
B|29| B: i'm sold _on_ nissans . 
A|30| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|31| B: [i] _a_ _or_ _or_ foreign cars actually . [uh] 
A|32| A: [but] _do you_ feel though [uh] craftsmanship [is] _much_ superior _to _the_ american_ abilities ? 
B|33| B: [uh] 
A|34| A: [is] [that] how [you] [i] [have] [never] 
B|35| B: _its_ reliability . 
A|36| A: [its] 
B|37| B: [its] reliability . [and] [uh] [i] _you know_ _i've_ read _all the_ consumer reports [and] things [and] _they_ [just] run head [and] shoulders above [the american] made cars . _if_ _ford_ [was] _a_ head _and the_ shoulders above [it] i'd [buy] _a ford_ . 
A|38| A: isn't [that] [a] shame . 
B|39| B: _but _i_ had_ [uh] _had_ _a ford_ escort [that] absolutely needed taps [the] day we _got_ [it .] 
A|40| A: _my_ word isn't [that] [sorry] . _that's_ [sorry] . 
B|41| B: [uh] _you know _i_ mean_ [it] [was] [ready] _for_ [the] graveyard . 
A|42| A: _my_ word . 
B|43| B: [and i] spent as [much] _on_ _that car_ [in] twelve [months] as [i] spent _for_ _the _car_ ._ 
A|44| A: [oh] mercy . 
B|45| B: [so] 
A|46| A: [you] 
B|47| B: [and] _that was_ [just] trying [to] _hold_ us getting [out] _of_ _that was_ [a] used _car ._ 
A|48| A: huh . 
B|49| B: [and it] [was] [an] older [car] 
A|50| A: huh . 
B|51| B: [but] _you know_ escort [is] supposed [to] [have] [a] great track record as far as sales . 
A|52| A: huh _. uh-huh ._ 
B|53| B: [but] [it's] [just] [it] [just] [was] not _and you_ _get_ stung [a] [time] _or_ two 
A|54| A: _sure_ . 
B|55| B: _and you_ say _no thanks ._ 
A|56| A: [no thanks .] _that's_ right . 
B|57| B: [so] [i just] trusted [the] consumer reports _and the_ auto [uh] reports 
A|58| A: _uh-huh uh-huh ._ 
B|59| B: _had_ [my] son _who_ knows _a lot_ about [that] study them thoroughly [and] he gave _me_ four choices _of_ cars [to] [buy] 
A|60| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|61| B: [an] escort definitely [was] not among them . [in] fact there wasn't [an] [american] [car] [in] there . 
A|62| A: [wow .] 
B|63| B: [uh] [the] nissan came [and] [and] we [bought] [the] nissan _for_ functional purposes not _what_ [the] consumer reports said we should _get_ . 
A|64| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: [but] [it] served our needs . [uh] later _on_ his reports [the] reports [that] he studied showed [that] [uh] nissan [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in] [the] [in] [the] class [that] we were looking _for_ . [and] [that] [and] i'd rather [have] [a] maxima than [a] cadillac . [i really] _would_ . [it's] not necessarily prestige 
A|66| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|67| B: [but] [it's] _comfort_ . [uh] there's _a lot of_ features _on_ there [that] [are] desirable _if_ _you're_ going [to] pay [that] kind _of_ money _for_ [a] _car ._ [uh] 
A|68| A: [who] makes [that car] ? 
B|69| B: nissan . 
A|70| A: [i mean] [but] where [are] [they] where [are] [they] [what] [what] [is] their location [is] [it] [uh] asian [or] [is] [it] european [or] [who] 
B|71| B: [no] . [no] [no] . nissan _is japanese ._ 
A|72| A: [oh] [it [is] japanese .] 
B|73| B: [uh-huh uh-huh] 
A|74| A: _okay_ 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [i] didn't [know] . 
B|77| B: [yeah .] [and] [uh] _if i_ couldn't [have] [my] luxury maxima then i'd [buy] _me_ [a] fancy little red c _r_ x sports [car] 
A|78| A: [uh-huh .] _okay_ 
B|79| B: [i mean] _you know_ every every _one_ _of_ us [have] two sides 
A|80| A: [yeah] _i guess_ [so] _that's_ true _. yeah ._ 
B|81| B: [yeah .] _now_ [what] about [you] _if_ [you] could [have] _the _car_ _that_ you_ _wanted_ [what] _would_ [you] _get_ 
A|82| A: [if] [if] _if i had [the_ car i] [wanted] . 
B|83| B: [and] why ? 
A|84| A: gee . 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [probably] um [uh] let's _see_ [i _like] the_ looks _of the_ lincoln town [car] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh uh-huh [.] yeah .] [see] there 
A|88| A: [but _i] _i_ don't_ [know] [the] performance [of] [it .] _that's_ [a ford] product 
B|89| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
A|90| A: [and [you] know [i] would] [get] hung [up] by [my] boot straps [if i] [if i] ever mentioned [the] [ford] product [in] [my] family . 
B|91| B: _uh-huh . _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ [i] tell [you] [that's] sad [too] because there _one_ [time] [ford] [was] [the] best _that was_ made . 
A|92| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|93| B: [really] [was] . 
A|94| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [and] [uh] [i [i] really] [have] not seen _now_ _a lot [of_ [the] american] cars actually [are] [are] parts [are] produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled here [or] vice versa . 
A|96| A: _can_ [i] put [you] [on] [hold] [for] [one] minute ? 
B|97| B: [of] course . 
A|98| A: thank [you] . [well] [that was] [one] minute . [they] hung [up .] 
B|99| B: [okay] [uh] at any rate [do you] [have] _color preferences_ [or] [what] [would] be [the] features _that you_ [would] be looking [for] ? 
A|100| A: um [well] [the] [comfort] [of] [a] large [car that] [the] security [of] [a] large [car .] um [and the] luxuries [of] [a] large [car .] 
B|101| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
A|102| A: [uh] [now] [color preferences] [i think] [i would] opt [to] _go_ _with_ [a] bronze . _which_ [is] [probably] closest [to] gold _that you can_ [get] 
B|103| B: [uh-huh uh-huh [.] yeah [.] oh] [wow .] we [like the] stuff [that] glitters 
A|104| A: [yeah .] 
B|105| B: good . there's nothing wrong [with] [that] . actually [i think] [probably] [if i] were going [to] [get] [if i] were going [to] be _practical_ [which] [doesn't] [mean] [i would] be [i would] prefer white . because simply because [it's] more visible at night . 
A|106| A: right [well] [practical] [yes] [that's] [uh-huh .] right [and it's] cooler [i] believe [too] when [you're] driving [in] 
B|107| B: [and] _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ [now] [the] interior [okay] [i don't] care about [the] interior [just] as long as [it's] not black [or] red . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [but] [if i had the] little red c _r_ x [i guess] [the] interior [would] [have] [to] be black leather [and] i'd [have] [to] live [with] [that] . [and] [if i] _got the_ c _r_ x [it] [would] [have] [to] [have] [a] real good sound system [in] [it] because i'd want [that] [too .] 
A|110| A: [oh .] 
B|111| B: i'd [just] [go] _back_ [to] [my] teenage years [and] [just] throw _all_ [my] experience [to the] wind 
A|112| A: um _can_ [you] [uh] hang [on] again 
B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [thanks] [i've] [got the] phones [for] lunch hour . 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [so] . [just] [don't] mind [me] [if i] bounce [back] [and] forth . 
B|117| B: [that's] [okay .] 
A|118| A: um [so] [you] [like _to] listen to uh_ [a lot of] _music or_ [do] [is] [it] talk shows . 
B|119| B: [no] [no] [no] . [i] generally [would] [uh] prefer [to listen to uh] [well i] [listen to] k c b [i] [a lot] [but i] [will] [listen [to] the] news [and the] [and the] traffic [and] _those_ things at work . 
A|120| A: [uh-huh uh-huh .] 
B|121| B: [but] [if] i'm going [to] be traveling [in] [that car] [for] any period [of] [time i] want some real good classical [music] . 
A|122| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: [i] love classical [music] [and you] [just] can't enjoy [it] unless you've [got] [a] good sound system [to] produce _all the_ _all the_ characteristics [of the] instruments . 
A|124| A: [all the] [yeah [.] uh-huh .] [that's] true . 
B|125| B: [so] [i] [do] love classical [music or] [it] [or] [or] [uh] contemporary classical . 
A|126| A: [do you] [listen] [do you] [listen to] _w r r_ ? 
B|127| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: huh . 
B|129| B: [sure] [do] . 
A|130| A: [yeah .] 
B|131| B: [w r r] [and the] oasis [are] [the] two [that] [i] [listen to] more than anything else . 
A|132| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|133| B: [and i] [do] [like] them . [and] i'd [like to] [have] [a] compact disc player [in] [the [car] .] [that] [would] be something [that] [i would] [really] [like] . 
A|134| A: [those] [are] nice aren't [they] ? [yes] [those] [are] nice . 
B|135| B: [those] compact discs [really] [are] good [for] cars because [they] [don't] melt 
A|136| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|137| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
A|138| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|139| B: [you know] there's nothing [in] there [that] [can] wrap around [the] [the] [uh] rollers [or] anything . [it] [seems like] [a] [really] good answer [to] portable [music] [that you can] choose . 
A|140| A: huh .
