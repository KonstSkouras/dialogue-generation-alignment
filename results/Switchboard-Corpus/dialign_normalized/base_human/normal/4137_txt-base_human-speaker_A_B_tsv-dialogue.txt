A|38| A: [uh ,] [oh ,] [of] course , [of] course [they] are . [they] [want] [you] [to buy] [their] car . [yeah ,] there , [it] was , [it] was interesting . [i] was at [, i] [, i] also went _to [,_ uh ,] [the] porsche [and] [, uh ,] [it] was , [it] was amazing how [they] were completely opposed . 
B|39| B: [oh ,] [really] ? 
A|40| A: [yeah ,] [the [,] uh ,] [the] [b m w] [is] [really ,] [oh ,] [like ,] [oh ,] we [have] _all_ these [like] high tech _things_ [and] everything [is] [put] together _with_ exacting tolerances [and] , [and] _then_ [you] [go] [to] porsche [and] [it's] [like _,] well [,_ uh ,] these [cars] are completely handmade

B|43| B: [yeah] _that's_ , 
A|44| A: _so it's_ [like] completely opposed . [i] don't [know [,] which] do [i] [like] [better [,] i think] [i] [like] [the] porsche's [philosophy] [a] [little] bit [better ,] although _it's not_ [really] practical . 
B|45| B: [no [,] [it's] not] realistic . 
A|46| A: unless [, it's] [, it's] _a toy_ . 
B|47| B: [yeah ,] if [you can] [afford] [that] _kind of_ [a toy] , [then] [, i] guess [, uh] 
A|48| A: let's face [it] . [yeah [,] yeah [,] but] [it] , [it] [, b m w] [good] [for] [that] . [what kind of] [driving] _just_ [like] commuting you'd [want to] do [it] , [use] [it] [for] ? 
B|49| B: [yeah [,] just] work , short trips . [no] [no] heavy mileage [. i'm] putting on less than fifteen [thousand] miles [a] year . 
A|50| A: wow _, yeah ._ 
B|51| B: [so it's] [pretty] minimal .

B|53| B: lasts [a] long time . [that's] mainly [what] [i'm] looking [for] . 
A|54| A: [yeah ,] [that's] [good] . [i] also [, i] was impressed by [, uh ,] by [the] _mercedes [,_ too] . 
B|55| B: [oh [, yeah] .] 
A|56| A: _i [really_ [,] _i] really_ [like] [the] _mercedes_ . 
B|57| B: [but] [, but] if , if [you] [have] [a] problem [with] [a] [mercedes [,] you] take [it] into [a] shop , they're going [to ,] they're going [to] hit [you] [up] [for] [just] [all] kinds [of] [things] 
A|58| A: [the] factory was nice [and] , [and] [is] [it] _different_ [for] [the ,] [for] [the] [b m w] ? 
B|59| B: [uh [, i] think] [, well ,] something on [the] order [of] [a] [three] series [, it's] _probably_ [different] . once [you] [get] [up] [in the] five series [and] higher , [then] [, all] your repair costs [go] [up] significantly 
A|60| A: [probably] . [right [,] i] [can] imagine [that] .
