A|20| A: _i i_ _think_ [this] _is a_ little ridiculous . 
B|21| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|22| A: _i_ _think_ _the only_ _people_ who benefit from _that_ are _the_ lawyers . 
B|23| B: _oh_ [that's] [right [.] i] work [for] [a] law firm 
A|24| A: [i] _i'm_ serious . [and] [i] _think_ _that_ _the_ lawyers _have_ caused [a] lot _of the_ problems _that_ exist [in] _the_ [in] _the_ criminal [system] today . with _plea bargaining_ . 
B|25| B: [right .] 
A|26| A: _you know_ if someone [is] 
B|27| B: [well] [plea] [plea bargaining] [is a] different story . 
A|28| A: [well] . 
B|29| B: [plea bargaining] [is] _something_ completely different . _that that_ actually prevents trials . _or_ _at_ least speeds them _up_ . 
A|30| A: _well i_ _know_ . [that's] what _i'm_ _saying_ . _but_ [i] _think_ [a] lot [of] all _of the_ whole criminal [system] [is] messed [up] [in] [in] [that] regard [. _i] mean _you_ know_ _people_ who commit [uh] crimes [that] [they] [i] don't _know_ how it works _exactly_ _but_ _you know_ [they] get lesser sentences 
B|31| B: [right .] 
A|32| A: [and] [i] understand [that] _the_ jails are full [of] _people_ _you know_ _uh and_ [that] [they] _have_ _to_ _do_ [something] . 
B|33| B: [right .] 
A|34| A: _but_ [i] _think_ [that] _the_ _reason_ [they] are full [is] because [they] _know_ [that] [they] [can] get away with it . 
B|35| B: huh . 
A|36| A: _you know_ what _i'm_ _saying_ ? [that] [we] don't _have_ [uh] [well] [a] lot [of] states don't _have_ capital punishment . 
B|37| B: [right .] 
A|38| A: [and] [uh] _i i_ _think_ [they] _should_ . 
B|39| B: [we] [do] 
A|40| A: [i] [and] [i] _think_ if [a] [person] [is] guilty [of] taking someone's life [and] _like_ [you] say it's it's [there's no] doubt whatsoever . _like_ drunk drivers [that] kill _people_ [and] [uh] _you know_ all 
B|41| B: [right .] 
A|42| A: [they] they're caught dead _to_ rights _. i i_ _just_ _think_ [that] [that's] they've they've taken [a] life [and] if [they] _should_ pay [for] it with [their] life . 
B|43| B: [right .] when _you're saying_ as far as [the] [appeal] [uh] procedure [was] concerned . 
A|44| A: _yeah ._ 
B|45| B: [we] [just] [have] [the] [case] [i'm] [i'm] sure you've probably heard [of] marion berry . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [uh] his last [appeal] [was] [was] denied two days before his sentence [was] [up] 
A|48| A: [oh] really . 
B|49| B: so [i mean] his [appeal] [was] denied [and] two days later he got _out_ [of] jail [for] cocaine possession . 
A|50| A: it [uh] _yeah ._ 
B|51| B: [but] [uh] [that] [was] absurd there [is] never there [was] [no] [reason] [the] [appeal] process _should have_ dragged [on] [that] long [for] [a] six month sentence . 
A|52| A: [i] _know_ [that that] [uh-huh .] [and] [i] don't _know_ [. uh] what _would_ [you] [do] _to_ change it ? _to_ make it better ? 
B|53| B: [well] [uh] [the] [the only] [i] [can] [i] [you know] [the] [appeal] procedure [is] [the only] [thing] [i] [can] possibly [think] [of] [. uh] [like] [i] said as far as removing [of the] [jury and] [having] [the] [judge] sentence [that's] absurd [. [there's] no] _way that_ [could] work . 
A|54| A: _oh yeah . i _i_ i_ don't agree with [that] [at] all . 
B|55| B: [uh] [but] 
A|56| A: imagine [the] guilt [that] [person] _would_ [have] [. [i] mean] burned [out] . 
B|57| B: [oh] [exactly] . 
A|58| A: [there's] [there's no] possible [way _that] _you_ could_ [uh] [you know] _feel_ good _about_ yourself . 
B|59| B: [exactly] . [right .] 
A|60| A: if [you] had _to_ [do] [something] [like] [that] day after day . 
B|61| B: [no] [one] [would] [want] [the] job 
A|62| A: [no] . not really . 
B|63| B: [uh and] [you know] [like] [i] said [the] [you know] everyone [has] [their] opinions [about] [every case] . 
A|64| A: [well] [do] [you] [think] _people_ [should have] [a trial] [is] they're caught dead _to_ rights [like] 
B|65| B: [oh yeah . [i i] feel] [that] everyone [is] everyone [is] [uh] entitled [to a trial by jury] . [that [that] that] [right] 
A|66| A: [i mean] supposing [i] come [up] [to] [you] [and] [i] [just] point blank kill [you] . 
B|67| B: [well [i] mean] [were] there witnesses ? 
A|68| A: [in] other words [you're saying] _that you_ [have] [to] find [out] whether it's premeditated [or] what [the] _circumstances_ [were] . 
B|69| B: [right .] [right .] [that you] can't [you] can't remove [the] [jury] regardless [of the] [case] . 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| B: [i mean [you] could] [have] fifty [people] [in] audience watching [a] murder take place 
A|72| A: [yeah .]
