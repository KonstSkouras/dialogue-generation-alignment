B|33| B: [right .] 
A|34| A: _but _,_ i_ _think_ [that] _the_ _reason_ [they] are full [is] because [they] _know_ [that] [they] [can] get away with it . 
B|35| B: huh . 
A|36| A: _you know_ what _i'm_ _saying_ ? [that] [we] don't _have_ _, uh ,_ [well] [a] lot [of] states don't _have_ capital punishment . 
B|37| B: [right .] 
A|38| A: _and _,_ uh_ _i , i_ _think_ [they] _should_ . 
B|39| B: [we] [do] 
A|40| A: _i _,_ and_ [i] _think_ if [a] [person] [is] guilty [of] taking someone's life [and] _like_ [you] say , it's , it's [, there's no] doubt whatsoever . _like_ drunk drivers [that] kill _people_ _and _,_ uh _,_ you know ,_ all 
B|41| B: [right .] 
A|42| A: [they] , they're caught dead _to_ rights _. i , i_ _just_ _think_ [that] [that's] , they've , they've taken [a] life [and] if , [they] _should_ pay [for] it with [their] life . 
B|43| B: [right .] when _you're saying_ as far as [the] [appeal [,] uh ,] procedure [was] concerned . 
A|44| A: _yeah ._ 
B|45| B: [we] [just] [have] [the] [case [,] i'm] [, i'm] sure you've probably heard [of] marion berry . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [uh ,] his last [appeal] [was ,] [was] denied two days before his sentence [was] [up] 
A|48| A: [oh ,] really . 
B|49| B: so [, i mean ,] his [appeal] [was] denied [and] two days later he got _out_ [of] jail [for] cocaine possession . 
A|50| A: it [, uh ,] _yeah ._ 
B|51| B: [but [,] uh _,] that_ [was] absurd there [is] never , there [was] [no] [reason] [the] [appeal] process _should have_ dragged [on] [that] long [for] [a] six month sentence . 
A|52| A: [i] _know_ [that , that] [uh-huh .] _and [,_ i] don't _know_ _. uh ,_ what _would_ [you] [do] _to_ change it ? _to_ make it better ? 
B|53| B: [well [,] uh ,] [the] , [the only] [i] [can] [, i] [you know ,] [the] , [appeal] procedure [is] [the only] [thing] [i] [can] possibly [think] [of] [. uh ,] [like] [i] said , as far as removing [of the] [jury and] [having] [the] [judge] sentence , [that's] absurd [.

B|59| B: [exactly] . [right .] 
A|60| A: if [you] had _to_ [do] [something] [like] [that ,] day after day .

B|65| B: [oh] [yeah . [i , i] feel] [that] everyone [is] , everyone [is] [, uh ,] entitled [to a trial by jury] . [that , [that] , that] [right] 
A|66| A: [i mean ,] supposing [i] come [up] [to] [you] [and] [i] [just] point blank kill [you] . 
B|67| B: [well [, i] mean ,] [were] there witnesses ? 
A|68| A: [in] other words [you're saying] [that [,] you] [have] [to] find [out] whether it's premeditated [or] what [the] _circumstances_ [were] . 
B|69| B: [right .] [right .] [that you] can't [, you] can't remove [the] [jury] regardless [of the] [case] . 
A|70| A: [yeah .]
