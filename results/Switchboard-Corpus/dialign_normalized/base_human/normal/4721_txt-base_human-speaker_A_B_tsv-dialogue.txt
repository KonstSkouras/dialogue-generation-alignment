[i] would] rather [be] outside [then] [in the] gym _doing_ this [in] _one_ place . 
B|9| B: _uh-huh_ . 
A|10| A: _and so_ [i] _just_ recently discovered _jazzercise_ [about] two months ago . [and] _i'm_ _getting_ [to be] _a good_ dancer from [it] [and] _i'm_ _just_ feeling _really_ _good [._ i] love [the] class _it's_ real challenging _so_ _i'm_ _really_ into _that i_ _really_ [like] _that_ _a_ lot . 
B|11| B: [well] [now] [that] _is_ [that] [uh] _that's_ related [to the] [the] _aerobic_ [uh]

B|13| B: okay . 
A|14| A: _it's_ an [aerobic] [exercise] [and] _it's_ an hour straight . [and] _it's_ _just_ [uh] _it's_ _a_ lot _of_ fun . 
B|15| B: _yeah _yeah_ ._ 
A|16| A: [and] _i'm_ _i'm_ _getting_ [much] _better_ . _my_ stamina [is] _getting_ great _for_ [the] dance floor _so_ _i mean_ _it's_ _just_ 
B|17| B: _yeah ._ 
A|18| A: there's _a_ lot _of_ positive [things] [with] [it] _so_ . 
B|19| B: [well] [uh] okay [. now] _that's_ _inside_ again [right] ? 
A|20| A: [it] [is] [inside] _and i've_ been _doing_ _a_ lot _of_ _bike_ riding outside _with the_ nice weather we've been _having_ 
B|21| B: [but] 
A|22| A: _and i_ _just_ enjoy [that] [much] more too than [inside] . 
B|23| B: [do] [do] [you] [like] [to do it] [with] other people [. [i] mean] [like] [the] [the] [jazzercise] [would] [be] ? 
A|24| A: [i have] _a_ thirteen year old daughter _and so_ we _go_ _bike_ riding [and] _it's_ nice . we [get] [to] spend some _time_ together rather than _i go_ [to the] gym _while_ she does her homework . 
B|25| B: _yeah _._ yeah ._ 
A|26| A: _so_ _i've_ _enjoyed_ [that] part _of_ [it] [. yeah .] [and] at [the] gym even [in the] class [uh i] _it's_ _not_ _really_ _a_ group where [you] chat _a_ lot . everybody's _on_ their way [to] someplace 
B|27| B: _right ._ 
A|28| A: _and so_ _you know_ [i] [do] [have] _one_ friend who goes occasionally 
B|29| B: [but] 
A|30| A: [but] basically [i] [do _it] by myself_ [in] _a_ group _of_ maybe forty _so_ . 
B|31| B: [yeah] _right [._ _right] ._ [but] still _there are there are_ other people _there_ [doing] [the] [doing] [the] same thing . 
A|32| A: [there are there are] . _it's_ more motivating [that] way _i think_ [. yeah .] 
B|33| B: [in] terms [of] motivation [and] incentive [yeah .] 
A|34| A: [you] could [get] _a_ tape probably [and] [do it] at home [in] front [of] [the] t v [but] [you] probably wouldn't . 
B|35| B: [yeah .] 
A|36| A: _so_ . 
B|37| B: [yeah] [uh] [that] makes [a] difference doesn't [it] ? 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [i] [i've] [one] thing [when] [when [i] have] run [and] jogged [uh] [i've] _always_ [enjoyed] [doing] [it by _myself] and_ [and] [not] [with the] sense [that] [it was] [uh] [uh] chore or something [that [i] was] [having] [to do] [i] [i've] [really] [enjoyed] [just] [the] activity [and uh i] write software [uh] as far as [the] job [and so] [getting] [out] [and] being active [uh] [is] [uh] [uh] helps [out] . [the] [it's] 
A|40| A: [yeah _yeah] _i_ can_ see it'll [be] _a good_ break . 
B|41| B: [the] [the] [the] change [of] pace [and] [just] [getting] [out] [and] _around_ 
A|42| A: [right .] 
B|43| B: [and _i] find [that_ [i] can] often [you know] often [uh] [when i] [get] _around_ [to] [doing] [it] [then] [i] [i] _feel better_ [when i] [get] [back] [to] work 
A|44| A: [uh-huh] 
B|45| B: [and uh] [uh] also [that] [that] [it] [my] subconscious [is] working [on] [things] [while] [i'm] working [and i] [i go] [back] [and i've] [got] new ideas [but] still . 
A|46| A: _i think_ [you] [do] . [you] [feel] very _good_ after [you] [exercise] [. _i] think_ [it's] worth making _the time for yourself ._ 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: [you] owe [it] [to] _yourself_ 
B|49| B: [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [and _i] think_ [you] [do] accomplish more after [that] . 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: [and _i] think_ [that] [it's] [just] [is] _good_ _for_ your self-esteem _for_ everything because [when] [you] look [better] [you] [feel better] [and] [it's] [just] _uh i think_ [it's] [well] worth [it] [. i] [just] demand [that] _time for_ [myself] [. now] [i've] learned [to do] [that] 
B|53| B: [yeah .] 
A|54| A: [and] [you know] [and] [it's] _i think_ [it] [just] benefits [you] all [around] . [so] . 
B|55| B: [yeah [i] think] _that's_ [uh i think] _that's_ [a good] term demanding [the time for yourself .] [that] you've [just] [got] [to] you've [just] [got] [to] 
A|56| A: _you have_ [to] . because there's [always] more [things] [to do] . 
B|57| B: [right .] 
A|58| A: [there] [is] [always] [things] [that] [you] [can] make priority [to] [it] [but] [i] [just] [i don't] demand [a] lot [for] [myself [and] so] [you know] [i] [just] [feel] entitled [to] [it] 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [and i] take [it] [so] . 
B|61| B: [well] [good] [well] [good .] [well] [uh] [uh] [have] [you have] [you] _done_ any jogging ? [i] tell [you] [you] said [you] did [on [the] bike and] [on the treadmill] [in] [in the] [uh] club . 
A|62| A: [no] [i've] [done] some walking [with] friends [in the past] . 
B|63| B: [uh-huh] . 
A|64| A: [but] [i find that] [when] [you] [do] [that] [you] [do] more chatting than [you] [do] [exercise] 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [and] [that's] [not] [really] beneficial [so] [uh [i] don't] [have] [time] [like] [that] 
B|67| B: [yeah [yeah] .] 
A|68| A: [and i] spend enough [time] chatting [around] everywhere [you know]
