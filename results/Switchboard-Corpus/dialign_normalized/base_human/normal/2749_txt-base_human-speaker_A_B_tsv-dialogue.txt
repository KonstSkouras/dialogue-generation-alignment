B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [i , i] [get] [a] little bit nervous [about] _it ,_ _and , uh ,_ 
B|21| B: i've , i've [never] i've [never] even been _called_ [to] [jury] duty . 
A|22| A: _yeah_ [, [i] , i] _was_ [called] once , [but] [i] _was_ [out] [of] [the] country , [and] apparently [i ,] apparently [they] thought [i] served so [i] didn't [, i] didn't _make_ any noise [about] [it] [i] came back [and] [they] said [the] record showed [i] served , [but] [i] _was_ [out] [of] [the] country [at] [the] time , so [i'm] pretty sure [i] didn't [. uh ,] 
B|23| B: _yeah _._ [i_ [,] uh _, i don't know ,] i_ _think_ [the [,] _i] guess_ _there's_ _a lot of_ problems _with [the_ legal system] 
A|24| A: [yeah] , [well _,] i i [, i don't_ know , i] definitely feel [like] we need [to] keep [it] [at] _least_ [unanimous] _because_ [, uh [, you] know ,] [there's] [the] classic sort [of] [to] kill [a] mockingbird [kind of] story [where] [you] [get] [, you know ,] 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: _and , uh ,_ [it] seems [to] _me_ [that] _if_ [you] _could_ [just] [have] [a] simple majority [or something] [you] _could_ pretty much [you know ,] browbeat [the jury] [, a] majority [, [in] the [,] of] [the [,] a] majority [of] [the jury] , 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: that's hard [to] say [. uh ,] so _, it's _, it's_ [,_ uh [, you] know ,] saying , [well ,] look we [don't] [like the] way he looks _and ,_ let's [, uh ,] let's throw [the] rascal [in] jail [and] stuff . 
B|29| B: _right ._ 
A|30| A: [and] [you] also [get] [a lot of] [, uh ,] juries [are] extremely [, uh ,] [and] [from] [what] [i] [hear [,] [i] , i] [have , i] [have] some friends _who_ do expert witness testimony [and] [they] say _that , uh ,_ juries [are] extremely vulnerable [to] [, uh ,] sort [of] emotional pitches [, you know [,] the] prosecutor will _want to_ , _oh [,_ i don't know] show [the ,] show [the] mugging victim [, you know ,] show [what] [the] _nice_ person he _was_ [and] [what] _a family_ _life_ , [and] basically [get] [the jury] _to be_ very sympathetic [with the] victim , _and , uh , or_ _, or_ _, uh , if_ _it's_ [a] corporation [, _that] _was_ [,_ uh [, you] know ,] harming some individual [or something like that ,] [they] [get] very much , [well [, you] know _,] _it's_ just_ [a] big faceless corporation . let's , let's _make_ them pay as much as possible . things [like that] . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: so [, not] [, [i] [, i] mean] [, i'm] [, the] problem [is] [i] can't guarantee [that] [a] [judge] [would] [be] necessarily [be] much better [than] [a jury] , [but] i'd [be] real nervous having [a jury] [not at] _least_ fully agree [on] [what] [the] settlements [would] [be] , things [like that] . 
B|33| B: [i [,] uh [, i] i , i don't] _think_ [the] [judge] should [just] [make] [the] decision alone . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| B: [least] [with [the] jury] [you] [have] _twelve_ [people] [, you know] [that] [are] _going to_ decide [, you know ,] 
A|36| A: [uh-huh [.] well ,] how [about] having [a jury] [and] [a] [judge] work together [on] [it] somehow ? [i] wonder _if_ that's possible ? [i guess] [the] judge's time [is] worth too much _, though_ . 
B|37| B: [judge] 
A|38| A: [they] pay [that] [judge] , [they] pay [those] [jury] members very little money compared [to] [that] [judge] 
B|39| B: [right ,] exactly 
A|40| A: he makes [more] money [in] an hour [than] [all] [twelve] [of] them [put] together . 
B|41| B: probably , [yeah] [yeah .] [but [,] uh ,] no [, it's , it's] sad [, though] [, [that] , uh [,] that] [the] [people] [, though] [, that] [you] [, you] , somebody's [life] [is] [in] [twelve] people's hands [and] sometimes [those] [twelve] [people] [could] care less . 
A|42| A: [uh-huh ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [and , uh , or] [they] fool _the , the_ defense [in] thinking [that] [they're [,] you know ,] [because] [when] [they] go through [those] processes [they] [kind of] pick [out] [who] _they want_ . 
A|44| A: _oh [,_ of course] . [it's , it's] political maneuvering . [the , the] one side [is] looking for [someone] whose face [they] [think] will [, you know ,] _want to_ hang _everyone_ , [and] [the] other one [is] [going to] look for [someone] very sympathetic . [they're] [not] looking for [someone] who's [going _to] be_ [the] most reasoned [or] sensible [or] rational juror . *whose who's neither side wants [that] . [they _want] to_ find [a] juror that's [going to] [, uh ,] [be] most persuadable [by] their arguments _, you know ._ 
B|45| B: exactly . 
A|46| A: [uh , i] wish [it] were [a] little bit harder [to] [not] serve [on] juries actually [. [i] mean] [, i [know] ,] _it ,_ _it [,_ it's] tricky [because] [i [know] [,] you know ,] an awful [lot of] intelligent [people] [who] [just] , [well] [i'm] too busy [to] serve [on] [a jury] , 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: so i'll tell them [that] [and] [they] won't [, or] [just] [, you know ,] [just] answer one [of] [the] questions [the] wrong way [because] [you] can do [that [,] you know ,] 
B|49| B: [oh ,] [yeah [.] well ,] 
A|50| A: _they just_ say do [you] believe [in] such [and] such [. uh ,] 
B|51| B: [i guess] [it's just] [that] maybe [people] [are] [, you know ,] upset [at] court [, you know .] [if] _it [was_ [,] if] _it was_ [a] [, [a] family] member [of] theirs [, though] [that was] innocent [and [,] then] _they'd_ [want [to] be] [on] [that] _jury ._ 
A|52| A: [right .] [course] , [they'd] [be] , [they would] [be] barred , [but] 
B|53| B: [but [,] uh , [if] everyone] [would] take [it , i] [think] [if everyone] took [it] seriously 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] , [well] [it] sounds [like] we both need [to] [get] [out] [there] [and] serve [on] [a jury .] 
B|55| B: [yeah .] 
A|56| A: [i] hope we're [called] _up_ before too long . 
B|57| B: [i would] love [to be] [called] [, i'm] ready [to] go [they just] haven't [called] [me] [up] yet 
A|58| A: [they] will , [they] will eventually . okay , [well] _it was nice talking_ [with] _you ._ 
B|59| B: [it was nice talking] [to] [you .]
