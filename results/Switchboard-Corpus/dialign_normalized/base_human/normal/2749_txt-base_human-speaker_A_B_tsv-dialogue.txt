A|6| A: _well_ _what_ [about] [the] idea [that] one [is] only guilty _uh when_ proven guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt ? [i] thought _that was_ [the] point [of] [uh] [a] [unanimous] [jury] _was_ [the] idea [that] _if everyone_ agrees _then_ [there] shouldn't [be] any reasonable doubt . 
B|7| B: [uh-huh .] _right ._ 
A|8| A: _but_ _if_ [there] _are_ some _people_ _who_ [don't] agree [uh] _then_ [there] must [be] [it] seems _to be_ [there] must [be] [at] _least_ [a] reasonable doubt for some _people_ .

A|10| A: really ? [have] [you] served [on] [a jury] ? 
B|11| B: _never_ . 
A|12| A: [i] [never] [have] [either] [but] my friends my few friends _who_ [have] [uh] say [just] [the] opposite _they_ say [they're] [uh] remarkably incompetent . _and uh_ [don't [know] what they're doing] [and] say one thing _in the_ courtroom _and then_ as soon as _they_ _get_ _in the_ back room _they just_ start letting [all] their prejudices hang _out and_ _to_ _to_ air [and] [all] [that] . 
B|13| B: huh _. _well_ you_ _would_ _think_ _that _they_ would_ [get] [that] [in the [uh] when] [the] prosecution [and] defense [are] choosing _the jury_ [you] _would_ _think_ [that] _those_ _would_ come [out and] _i _i_ know_ [they] automatically [when] [you] go through [uh when] you're chosen [is] you're automatically _like_ [a] [a] [a] professor [in] criminal justice _or something like that_ [that] you're automatically no _they don't want_ [you] [on] _the _jury_ ._ 
A|14| A: [right] [they don't want] anyone _with_ anyone _with_ particular experience [or] knowledge [of] _the legal system_ . 
B|15| B: exactly . [uh-huh] exactly _. uh_ 
A|16| A: [and] [they] tend [and] since anyone can [get] [out] [of] [it] _who_ basically says [they don't _want] to_ do _it [i_ mean [you] know] _it's it's_ anyone can [get] [out] [of] [jury] [just] [about] _and uh_ so [it] _it's_ [uh] _it's_ [not] really my peers [that] _if_ [i] were let's say [i] were arrested [falsely] [or] [not] [and] [put] _up_ for [a jury] [i] wouldn't feel _that [uh_ _i] would_ [be] being tried [by a jury] [of] my peers . 
B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: i'd [be] [i mean] i'd [be] tried [by a jury] [of] [you know] [people] _who_ had nothing else _to_ do [and] weren't very knowledgeable [about] certain sorts [of] things _and [uh_ i don't know] 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [i i] [get] [a] little bit nervous [about] [it] _and uh_ 
B|21| B: i've i've [never] i've [never] even been _called_ [to] [jury] duty . 
A|22| A: _yeah_ [i i] _was_ [called] once [but] [i] _was_ [out] [of] [the] country [and] apparently [i] apparently [they] thought [i] served so [i] didn't [i] didn't _make_ any noise [about] _it i_ came back [and] [they] said [the] record showed [i] served [but] [i] _was_ [out] [of] [the] country [at] [the] time so [i'm] pretty sure [i] didn't [. uh] 
B|23| B: _yeah _._ i_ [uh _i don't know] i_ _think_ [the] _i guess_ _there's_ _a lot of_ problems _with [the_ legal system] 
A|24| A: [yeah] [well] _i i [i don't_ know i] definitely feel [like] we need [to] keep [it] [at] _least_ [unanimous] _because_ [uh [you] know] [there's] [the] classic sort [of] [to] kill [a] mockingbird [kind of] story [where] [you] [get] [you know] 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: _and uh_ [it] seems [to] _me_ [that] _if_ [you] _could_ [just] [have] [a] simple majority [or something] [you] _could_ pretty much [you know] browbeat [the jury] [a] majority [in the] [of] [the] [a] majority [of] [the jury] 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: that's hard [to] say [. uh] so _it's it's_ [uh [you] know] saying [well] look we [don't] [like the] way he looks [and] let's [uh] let's throw [the] rascal [in] jail [and] stuff . 
B|29| B: _right ._ 
A|30| A: [and] [you] also [get] [a lot of] [uh] juries [are] extremely [uh] [and] [from] [what] [i] [hear] [i i] [have i] [have] some friends _who_ do expert witness testimony [and] [they] say _that uh_ juries [are] extremely vulnerable [to] [uh] sort [of] emotional pitches [you know] [the] prosecutor will _want to_ _oh_ [i don't know] show [the] show [the] mugging victim [you know] show [what] [the] _nice_ person he _was_ [and] [what] _a family_ _life_ [and] basically [get] [the jury] _to be_ very sympathetic [with the] victim _and uh or_ [or] _uh if_ _it's_ [a] corporation _that was_ [uh [you] know] harming some individual [or something like [that] they] [get] very much [well [you] know] _it's just_ [a] big faceless corporation . let's let's _make_ them pay as much as possible . things [like that] . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: so [not] [i [i] mean] [i'm] [the] problem [is] [i] can't guarantee [that] [a] [judge] [would] [be] necessarily [be] much better [than] [a jury] [but] i'd [be] real nervous having [a jury] [not at] _least_ fully agree [on] [what] [the] settlements [would] [be] things [like that] . 
B|33| B: [i] [uh [i] i i don't] _think_ [the] [judge] should [just] [make] [the] decision alone . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| B: [least] [with [the] jury] [you] [have] _twelve_ [people] [you know] [that] [are] _going to_ decide [you know] 
A|36| A: [uh-huh [.] well] how [about] having [a jury] [and] [a] [judge] work together [on] [it] somehow ? [i] wonder _if_ that's possible ? [i guess] [the] judge's time [is] worth too much _though_ . 
B|37| B: [judge] 
A|38| A: [they] pay [that] [judge] [they] pay [those] [jury] members very little money compared [to] [that] [judge] 
B|39| B: [right] exactly 
A|40| A: he makes [more] money [in] an hour [than] [all] [twelve] [of] them [put] together . 
B|41| B: probably [yeah] [yeah .] [but] [uh] no [it's it's] sad [though] [that uh] [that] [the] [people] [though] _that you_ [you] somebody's [life] [is] [in] [twelve] people's hands [and] sometimes [those] [twelve] [people] [could] care less . 
A|42| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [and uh or] [they] fool _the the_ defense [in] thinking [that] [they're] [you know] [because] [when] [they] go through [those] processes [they] [kind of] pick [out] [who] _they want_ . 
A|44| A: _oh_ [of course] . [it's it's] political maneuvering . [the the] one side [is] looking for [someone] whose face [they] [think] will [you know] _want to_ hang _everyone_ [and] [the] other one [is] [going to] look for [someone] very sympathetic . [they're] [not] looking for [someone] who's [going _to] be_ [the] most reasoned [or] sensible [or] rational juror . *whose who's neither side wants [that] . [they _want] to_ find [a] juror that's [going to] [uh] [be] most persuadable [by] their arguments _you know ._ 
B|45| B: exactly . 
A|46| A: [uh i] wish [it] were [a] little bit harder [to] [not] serve [on] juries actually [. [i] mean] [i know] [it] [it] [it's] tricky [because] [i know] [you know] an awful [lot of] intelligent [people] [who] [just] [well] [i'm] too busy [to] serve [on] [a jury] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: so i'll tell them [that] [and] [they] won't [or] [just] [you know] [just] answer one [of] [the] questions [the] wrong way [because] [you] can do [that [you] know] 
B|49| B: [oh] [yeah [.] well] 
A|50| A: _they just_ say do [you] believe [in] such [and] such [. uh] 
B|51| B: [i guess] [it's just] [that] maybe [people] [are] [you know] upset [at] court [you know .] [if] _it was_ [if] _it was_ [a] [a family] member [of] theirs [though] [that was] innocent [and then] _they'd_ [want [to] be] [on] [that] _jury ._ 
A|52| A: [right .] [course] [they'd] [be] [they would] [be] barred [but] 
B|53| B: [but] [uh [if] everyone] [would] take [it i] [think] [if everyone] took [it] seriously 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [well] [it] sounds [like] we both need [to] [get] [out] [there] [and] serve [on] [a jury .] 
B|55| B: [yeah .] 
A|56| A: [i] hope we're [called] _up_ before too long . 
B|57| B: [i would] love [to be] [called] [i'm] ready [to] go [they just] haven't [called] [me] [up] yet 
A|58| A: [they] will [they] will eventually . okay [well] _it was nice talking_ [with] _you ._ 
B|59| B: [it was nice talking] [to] [you .] 
A|60| A: _bye-bye ._ 
B|61| B: [bye-bye .]
