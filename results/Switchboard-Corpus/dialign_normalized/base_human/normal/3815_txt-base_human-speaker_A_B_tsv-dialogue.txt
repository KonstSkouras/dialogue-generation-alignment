B|39| B: [did] [it] [have ,] [what] [, a] _three_ _speed_ [or] [a] four _speed_ ? 
A|40| A: _no [,_ a] five [speed] . _and it ,_ basically [, it] [was] something [that] [a] military [guy] [had] ordered [and] hadn't picked [up] [, and] [so] [it] [had] [been] [on the] [lot] [three] months [and] [they] were [really] eager [to] sell [it] . 
B|41| B: wow . 
A|42| A: [so _,] i guess_ [in] this area , at least [, you know , if] [it's] [not] automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|43| B: [well [,] actually] [, i] much [prefer] [a stick shift] [and ,] [what] _, [i'm_ _,] i'm_ curious [. [i] , [i] know] [why] [i] love [a [stick shift] .] [why] [why] [did] [you] [want] [one] ? 
A|44| A: [well [,] i] [just] wanted [it] because , again [, i] [had] _, i guess_ traditionally always [had a car] [that] [had] [one] [and i] thought [it] would be _more_ reliable . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [uh ,] 
B|47| B: [it's] hard [to] [find] [stick shift] _cars_ _anymore ._

B|49| B: huh , [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [so ,] 
B|51| B: [no , [i] mean] most [of the] _sports cars_ [are] [stick shift .]

B|55| B: huh . 
A|56| A: [and] [so] [why] _do_ [you] [like] [stick shift] ? 
B|57| B: [uh [, i guess] [i] , i] grew [up] [on] [it] [and] [it's] fun . [it's] , [it's] [an] enjoyable part [of] driving [. i] [do] feel [like] [i] [have [,] uh , more] control over [the] [car] 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .]

A|60| A: [uh-huh .] right . 
B|61| B: [uh [,] [it] , it] does [, uh , [i] don't [know] [,] [it] ,] [it's] [really] [more] fun than [anything] else . as _long_ as you're [not] stuck [in] heavy traffic , [it's] fun 
A|62| A: right [, and] [actually] [it's] [probably] safer [on] [, you know ,] at [long] trips because [it] keeps [you] [more] active . 
B|63| B: [yeah] , [yeah] 
A|64| A: [so ,]
