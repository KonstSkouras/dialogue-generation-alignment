A|8| A: _i see_ 
B|9| B: _now_ 
A|10| A: top [of] top _of the_ line . 
B|11| B: [well] _not_ _so_ much _that_ as _it_ is _i've_ _had_ _so_ many times _when_ _uh_ _uh_ _you know_ i'll _have a_ friend next [to] _me_ _or_ [i see] somebody _uh_ _guy_ broken down _on the_ side [of the] road _and_ try [to] lean over _and_ roll down [the] window . 
A|12| A: _oh ._

A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ right right . 
B|15| B: _and uh so_ _power locks_ _power windows_ [are] _just_ _just_ things _that_ _uh_ _just_ _really_ help _a lot_ 
A|16| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: [what] _about_ _you ?_ 
A|18| A: [well] _i guess_ [i'm] _uh more_ traditional _in_ [that _i] don't_ _like_ [power windows] [or] [power locks] because [the] people [that i know] who [have] [them] always seem [to] [have] trouble _with_ [them] . 
B|19| B: [oh .] 
A|20| A: [and uh so] _i don't_ [i] [just] _don't_ _like_ _anything_ [that i] can't figure out _why_ [it] doesn't work 
B|21| B: _sure_ . 
A|22| A: [and] then [i] _want_ [you know] good [uh] gas mileage _and i_ _want_ _an air bag_ [and _uh] i guess_ 
B|23| B: _have you_ ever _had a _car_ with_ [an air bag] ? 
A|24| A: _no i_ haven't . [have [you] ?] 
B|25| B: [no] . 
A|26| A: somehow [i] [just] _think_ [you know] _i like the_ idea 
B|27| B: [well] _it it_ _sure_ seems [to] save lives [and] 
A|28| A: right . 
B|29| B: [uh] _yeah _._ _i_ actually [i_ like the] anti-lock brakes . 
A|30| A: right that's [a] good idea . 
B|31| B: [and i] [have] never _had a_ chance [to] [i] [have] _been_ [in] _cars_ [that] [have] _had_ [them] _but_ _i've_ never tromped _on the_ brakes [to] [see] [uh] [you know] _on_ ice [or] water [just] [to] [see] _if_ _they_ _didn't_ lock _up_ . 
A|32| A: _uh-huh_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|33| B: _but_ [uh] [you] [think] you'd buy [uh] [an] _american_ [car] [or] [a] european [or] japanese ? 
A|34| A: [well] [i actually _i] don't know_ [a lot] [about] different brands [. i] tend [to] [have [you] know] my requirements [like the] last time [i] bought [a car] _i _i_ guess i_ _did_ sort [of] _prefer_ [american] [and] my requirements were basically [you know] good repair record good mileage [uh] [and i] needed air-conditioning [and uh] can't remember [what] my [oh] [i] wanted [uh] _stick shift ._ [and] [so] [i] [didn't] [have a] whole [lot] [of] choice there _was_ _one_ [car] [in] _all_ [of the] [the] metropolitan area [that i] could _find_ [that] [you know] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car with] _a stick shift_ [in] [it] . 
B|35| B: [what] [was] [that] ? 
A|36| A: [it it] turned out [to] be [a] [a] chrysler . [uh] lancer . 
B|37| B: huh [stick shift] huh ? 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [did] [it] [have] [what] [a] _three_ _speed_ [or] [a] four _speed_ ? 
A|40| A: [no] [a] five [speed] . _and it_ basically [it] [was] something [that] [a] military [guy] [had] ordered [and] hadn't picked [up] [and] [so] [it] [had] [been] [on the] [lot] [three] months [and] [they] were [really] eager [to] sell [it] . 
B|41| B: wow . 
A|42| A: [so] _i guess_ [in] this area at least [you know if] [it's] [not] automatic [it] doesn't move . 
B|43| B: [well] [actually i] much [prefer] [a stick shift] [and] [what] [i'm] [i'm] curious [. [i] [i] know] [why] [i] love [a [stick shift] .] [why] [why] [did] [you] [want] [one] ? 
A|44| A: [well] [i] [just] wanted [it] because again [i] [had] _i guess_ traditionally always [had a car] [that] [had] [one] [and i] thought [it] would be _more_ reliable . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [uh] 
B|47| B: [it's] hard [to] [find] [stick shift] _cars_ _anymore ._ 
A|48| A: [i] found [that] out [. _i] mean_ [you know] [the] people would [just] sort [of] look at [me] [like] [you] must be crazy [when] [i] went [in] [to] [and] asked [and] [that] [was] [a] requirement [so] 
B|49| B: huh [yeah .] 
A|50| A: [so] 
B|51| B: [no [i] mean] most [of the] _sports cars_ [are] [stick shift .] 
A|52| A: [well] [i'm] [not] even [sure] _all_ [of] [them] [are] [anymore .] at least [in] this area . 
B|53| B: huh . 
A|54| A: [not] [that i] [was] [looking for] [sports cars] [but] [now] [the] people [i've] talked [to] _don't_ seem [to] [have] [stick shift .] 
B|55| B: huh . 
A|56| A: [and] [so] [why] _do_ [you] [like] [stick shift] ? 
B|57| B: [uh [i guess] [i] i] grew [up] [on] [it] [and] [it's] fun . [it's] [it's] [an] enjoyable part [of] driving [. i] [do] feel [like] [i] [have] [uh more] control over [the] [car] 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [and [it] it] [to] [me] [it] gives [me] [more] [a lot] [more] control [in] snow [and] ice [and] slick conditions . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] right . 
B|61| B: [uh] [it it] does [uh [i] don't know] [it] [it's] [really] [more] fun than [anything] else . as _long_ as you're [not] stuck [in] heavy traffic [it's] fun 
A|62| A: right [and] [actually] [it's] [probably] safer [on] [you know] at [long] trips because [it] keeps [you] [more] active . 
B|63| B: [yeah] [yeah] 
A|64| A: [so]
