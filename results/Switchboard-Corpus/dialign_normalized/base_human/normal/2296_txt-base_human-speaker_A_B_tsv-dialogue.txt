A|23| A: [oh ,] [well ,] _that's_ [great] , _that's_ [great .] 
B|24| B: [and that's] _really_ [a] terrific feeling , [because you] [just] _go_ [there] _at the end of the day [,_ and] [you] figure , god _, i'm ready_ [for] bed [and] [you] _exercise_ [and] _then_ [, it's] _sort of_ painful [for] [a] while ,

B|38| B: huh .
