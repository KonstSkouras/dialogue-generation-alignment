B|14| B: _okay _,_ and _,_ and_ _in_ , _in_ his league _do_ _they have_ _like_ [a] pitcher _, or_ _do_ _they _have_ a_ standing ball _or_ [a] machine _, or_ [what] ? 
A|15| A: _up_ until _, it's_ coach pitch , until [you] _get_ nine _which_ [my] _little_ boy will [be] nine [in] may .

A|17| A: [so] _he's_ going _to be with_ [, uh ,] regular pitching

A|21| A: uh-huh . 
B|22| B: _so ._ 
A|23| A: _but_ yes , we're into [baseball] [, and] _it_ seems [like] soon _as_ [that] over [with] _we_ _get_ into basketball . _we_ even [have] peewee basketball _here _._ _so_ there's_ _always_ _something ._ 
B|24| B: _yeah [,_ and] _how_ about , _how_ about [like] _on_ _the_ weekends . _do_ [you] _do_ [sports] _or_ _do_ [you] _go_ _out_ ? 
A|25| A: both . _if_ we're _not_ [doing] [sports] _we_ [go] somewhere . 
B|26| B: _do_ [you] _go ,_ _how_ about [like] _for_ [, uh ,] _do_ [you] [go] _for_ long vacations , [like] [a] week _or_ [something] _when _they_ have_ school off ? 
A|27| A: [oh _,] _yeah ,_ _yeah ,_ [yeah_ .] 
B|28| B: _in the summer_ _or_ [like] _in the_ easter _time_ , [like] around _now_ ? 
A|29| A: _no ,_ usually [in the summer] [time] . 
B|30| B: [and] where _do_ [you] [go] ? 
A|31| A: different _places_ every [year] . _we_ , 
B|32| B: [have] , [have] [you] _been_ _out of_ [the] country ? 
A|33| A: _no_ 
B|34| B: [oh ,] _okay _,_ well ,_ first , [they] [always] say , [get] [to] [know] your country first _before_ [you] _leave_ _, i mean_ _i _,_ i_ lived [in] [places] , [like] 
A|35| A: uh-huh . 
B|36| B: _when i_ lived [in] _washington_ [, uh ,] _washington_ , d c _, i_ _never_ _went to the_ _washington_ _memorial [,_ and] _then_ _when i_ _went_ back [to] visit _, i_ _went to the_ _washington_ _memorial_ . 
A|37| A: _you know _,_ i've_ heard _, we_ [have a] _couple of_ _friends_ [that] goes [to] [washington] quite often [, _and] that_ must [be] [the] _thing ._ [they] really hadn't either . [they] [went to the] [memorial _,] you know , [when_ _they] [go_ _,] it's_ [on] business 
B|38| B: _right_ . 
A|39| A: _it's not_ really _just_ [to] _getting_ [to] sight _see_ . 
B|40| B: _right_ . [well [,] it's] [, it's] [a] beautiful city . 
A|41| A: [oh [,] i] bet _it_ _is ,_ too . 
B|42| B: _but ,_ [the] _problem_ [is ,] [like] first [time] [i] [went] _out of_ [here] _, and they_ took me [to] las vegas 
A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| B: [and that] _was_ [the] most boring place [on] earth . 
A|45| A: [oh _,] now_ [my] husband _and i _,_ we_ [go] different [places] _. but_ our [but] [when] _we_ [go] [with] our [children] _we_ usually kind [of] _stay_ close . 
B|46| B: [yeah .] did [, uh ,] did , [like] , did [you] [go] [to] disneyland ? 
A|47| A: [oh ,] yes , yes , yes . 
B|48| B: [oh ,] _okay_ [. so] _, but_ um [, _now] [,_ i] _don't_ [know _,] but_ um _, but_ let's [see] _, when i was_ [eleven] [i] [went] _also_ [to the] caribbean . 
A|49| A: [oh] . 
B|50| B: _and [,_ uh ,] _then_ _after_ [that] [, [i] _,] my_ sister lives [in] turkey , [so] _when i was_ [like] fourteen , fifteen [, i] [went] [, i] [went to] turkey . 
A|51| A: [oh ,] 
B|52| B: [and] _this_ christmas [, i] [went to] turkey [. but] basically [, it's] [a] , _for_ [the] past [couple of] _years_ [, [i] ,] since [my] parents [are] , [are] _, well ,_ i'm from argentina [, [and] my] parents live down there [. so] , all [the] traveling [i] _do_ [is] alone . 
A|53| A: uh-huh . 
B|54| B: _and [,_ uh [,] we] were _never_ _much_ [of] [, uh ,] [a] _very_ [, uh ,] family [thing] [, you know ,] made , [like] [go] skiing [in] vermont _or_ [something .] 
A|55| A: uh-huh . 
B|56| B: [that] _was_ [, uh _,] that_ _was_ [a] lot [of] fun . 
A|57| A: yes . 
B|58| B: _but _,_ what_ happens [is] [we] used [to] fight [a] lot , [so there's] _never_ _much_ [of] [a] family family [thing .] [you know ,] one [of] those hell family vacations . 
A|59| A: [oh ,] yes [, but] [we] _try_ _, you know , i_ _try_ [, my] husband [also] , we're involved [in] _everything_ our _kids_ [does] 
B|60| B: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: _because [,_ uh _,] my dad_ died _, you know [, when_ i was] less than _a [year_ old] 
B|62| B: [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [so] [i] [always] _just_ _had a_ mother [. so] [i] [always] thought [, when _i] have _kids_ _,_ you know , i_ really _want _to_ be_ involved _with them_ . 
B|64| B: [well [,] my dad] , all he , all he wanted _to do_ [was] [get] _money_ _for_ _us ,_ [so] he could buy _us_ _material things_ . 
A|65| A: [material things] , yes [, that] [is ,] yes , 
B|66| B: _and [,_ and] [to] me [, you know [,] it's] [like] [, now] i'm twenty-two [, but] [i] _still_ feel [, you know [,] it's] [like] [yeah [,] we] _never_ threw [a] football _or_ [something] 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| B: [and] [the] way [i was] brought [up] [, and] he wants me _now ,_ he , [like] he [, you know ,] [like] he wants [to be] _best friends_ [now] 
A|69| A: [best friends] [, [now] .] 
B|70| B: [and] [it's] _very_ hard _for_ me [because [,] you know [,] it's] [like] [you] grow [up] [to be] twenty _years_ [old [,] and] [it's] [always] [the] same man 
A|71| A: uh-huh . 
B|72| B: [and] _then_ suddenly he sees [that] [he's] [getting] [old [,] and] he wants [to be] [best friends] 
A|73| A: [yeah .] 
B|74| B: _but [,_ uh [,] you know [,] it's] [like] [, i] _can_ only express myself [so] _much_ , [because [,] you know ,] um , [everything] [that] he taught me [, you know [,] that] [my] family taught me , [which] [is] _very_ hard [to] change [that] all [of] [a] sudden from one [year] [to the] next [and] say , i'm sorry _, you know ._ [it's] [like] [, you know , _i] love_ [you] [and] let's [go] _out_ [and] _do_ [things] together [when i] _don't_ feel [like] [it] [, you know] 
A|75| A: uh-huh . 
B|76| B: [and] [so] [, that's] [that] whole [thing] [that] he'll say [when] , [like] , [like] [i've] seen [my] uncle [and] his family [, you know ,] [does] [everything] together [, _and] [you_ know ,] his [kids] [are] [, you know , when] his [little] girl [was] [five] _years_ [old] [and] [everything] , [they [,] uh ,] [they] [would] [go] [to the] beach [, and] she could [go] [to] sleep [at] two [in the] morning [you know] 
A|77| A: [oh ,] uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|78| B: _and [,_ uh [,] [i] was] brought [up] [the] same way _, it_ doesn't [matter] [what] age _you have_ , [just] [so] long [as] _you can_ [get] [up] [to] [go] [to] class [the] next morning [, _you] can_ [stay] [up] [you know ,] 
A|79| A: uh-huh . 
B|80| B: [but] his _, what_ he [does] [is [,] when] he _gets_ home , he separates his _work_ from his house . 
A|81| A: [yeah [,] [you] _have] to_ 
B|82| B: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: _i mean , you_ honestly [do] _. _now_ i have_ [friends] [that] [i love] [to] death _, but [,_ and [they] have] [children] [, but] their [children] [does] anything [, we] _have to_ take _them_ [, _and ,] you know_ [to do] [it] . 
B|84| B: [yeah .] 
A|85| A: [and that] really [gets] kind [of] aggravating [after] [a] while [because] _you're_ _saying [,_ _well ,] i_ [work] full [time] too [, you know .] 
B|86| B: [yeah , yeah [,] but [,] uh [,] it's] [just] [, it's] [just] [something] [that] [, you know [,] my] theory [is [,] you know , when] [, when] [you [have] kids] [and] all [you] [, you] [want [to] do] [, well _,] what_ i'll [do] [is [,] you know ,] [like] _, [i mean ,_ you] might [have] problems [, but] [it's not] your kids' problems [you know ,] 
A|87| A: [yeah _,] oh [,_ [yeah] .] 
B|88| B: _and you_ got [to] [try] [to be [with] them] [as] _much_ [as] _you can_ [and] [to] [, you know ,] [like] , [thing] [is [,] [is] [,] that] [, you know ,] [like] [if] _, if_ [they] [would] ever happen [to] [have a] drug _problem ,_ suppose [, that] [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] [saying [,] i] got [a] _problem_ [you know ,] 
A|89| A: [problem ,] uh-huh 
B|90| B: [and [,] uh] [and that] [would] make any parent feel _good_ [and] bad [at] [the] same [time] [, you know ,] 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| B: first [of] all [you're] coming [to] me [and] let's [see] _how_ [we] _can_ [get] rid [of] [the] [problem [,] you know [,] and] [that's] [uh [,] that's] _very_ [, that's] _very_ hard [to do] , [because] once [you're] [best friends] [with] your parents , _then_ [, i] think [everything] [go] [a] lot better . 
A|93| A: uh-huh [, _yeah ,] i_ agree [with] [you] [very] [much] [so _.] [now_ [,] we] waited several [years] [before] [we] started having [children] [because] [we] [was] [still] [in] _college [,_ and] [we] knew [time] wise [, or] [, and] [money] wise , too 
B|94| B: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [would] [, it] [would] [not] [have] [been] [a] [good] idea [to] _had_ [them] [then] . 
B|96| B: [yeah [,] my] [, my] father [was] raising four [oh] [well ,] three [kids] [before] he [had] me , [so] [it] [was] [, uh [,] you know ,] [you're] trying , [to] support [, uh ,] four [kids [,] and] [it's] pretty hard [you know ,] 
A|97| A: [yeah .] 
B|98| B: [and i [,] i] told him , listen [you] could [have] [had a] lot [of] [money] _if you_ [would] [have] only [had] two [kids] . 
A|99| A: uh-huh [, [yeah] .] 
B|100| B: he says [yeah [,] but] [then] [i] wouldn't [have] [you] [, i] [go [,] yeah [,] but] [then] [you] [would] [have a] lot [of] [money] 
A|101| A: [that's] _right _,_ but you_ can't take [this] [money] [with] [us ,] though 
B|102| B: [yeah .] 
A|103| A: [that's] [how] [i] keep _looking_ [at] [it] . 
B|104| B: [but [,] you know ,] [like] , four _, i mean_ four [children] [is] expensive , especially [when] [you] consider [like] , especially _for_ me , [which] i'm paying _out of_ state tuition . i'm paying [, you know ,] three thousand [, no _,] what_ [is] [it] , two thousand six hundred dollars _for_ one semester . 
A|105| A: [oh] . 
B|106| B: [and [, you know] ,] people say [, you know [,] it's] expensive [to] think [it's] [college [,] but _,] if_ _, if_ everybody [would] [be] [a] [little] bit responsible [, you know [,] it's] [like] _, what_ [does] [it] _, what_ [does] [it] cost . [it] costs [five] hundred dollars [a] semester suppose [. now] [they go] [to] [a] state [college] [and they] live [at] home [you know ,] 
A|107| A: uh-huh . 
B|108| B: [and] [well [,] it] costs two hundred dollars _for_ books [, but [you] know ,] seven hundred dollars [a] semester , [a] lot [of] people _can_ spare [that] [if] [they] planned ahead [, you know ,] [like] 
A|109| A: [oh [,] yeah _,] if you_ [if [you] can] [, [yeah] .] 
B|110| B: [i mean [,] it's] [like] [, if you] plan [a year] ahead [, [you] can] probably save [up] seven hundred dollars [you know ,] one thousand four hundred dollars [to] send your child [to] [college [,] you know .] 
A|111| A: [yeah .] [what are you] learning [to be] ? 
B|112| B: [oh , oh ,] excuse me ? 
A|113| A: [what] degree [, i mean [,] what are you] wanting [to do] [after] [you] _get [out_ of] [college] ? 
B|114| B: [well , [i] ,] i'm [doing] computer science , computer engineering . 
A|115| A: [oh [,] _that's] [,_ my] husband's into [, uh ,] computers . 
B|116| B: [yeah [,] and [,] and] [now] i'm [looking] _for_ [a] job [before] [they [have] to] send me back home 
A|117| A: uh-huh . 
B|118| B: [because] since i'm an international student , [they] [want to] send me back [to] argentina . 
A|119| A: [yeah .] 
B|120| B: [well [,] my dad] wants me [to] [go] back [. [so] .] 
A|121| A: [and _you] don't_ [want to] ? 
B|122| B: [no .] 
A|123| A: [no [,] [no] .] 
B|124| B: [no ,] [because] [if you] [go] back there , [then] [you can] _never_ [get out] . 
A|125| A: [oh] . 
B|126| B: [like] [you don't] [have] any [money] [to] , [to] , [get out] . 
A|127| A: [oh] . 
B|128| B: [so] [, uh [,] and [,] uh [,] [i] was] thinking [, you know ,] [like] [, oh] [my] god [, you know , i] [go] back there [, and] [then] [, [and] i] [get] married there [, and] [now [i have] kids] there [, and] [then] i'll _never leave_ [the] place [, you know .] 
A|129| A: [then] you'll [never leave] . 
B|130| B: [yeah , i] [know [,] and] [that's [,] that's what] happened [to] [my] brother . he came [to] school [up] [here] [, and] [then] [when] he [went] down there , he [was] [just] [so] bad off [, you know] from [not] being able [to] [stay] [up] [here] [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
A|131| A: [oh] . uh-huh . 
B|132| B: [so .] 
A|133| A: [well] maybe [something] will open [up] [for] [you] . 
B|134| B: [yeah [,] i've] [been] calling [a] lot [of] companies . there , some [of] [them] [are] interested . [well ,] [at] least [for] [a year] [and] [a] half [i] [can] [work] , 
A|135| A: uh-huh . 
B|136| B: [so .] 
A|137| A: [well [,] well] [i've] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|138| B: all [right ,] same [here .]
