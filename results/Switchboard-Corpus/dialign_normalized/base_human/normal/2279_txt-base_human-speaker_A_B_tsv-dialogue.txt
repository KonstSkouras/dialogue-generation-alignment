A|25| A: both . _if_ we're _not_ [doing] [sports] _we_ [go] somewhere . 
B|26| B: _do_ [you] [go] _how_ about [like] _for_ [uh] _do_ [you] [go] _for_ long vacations [like] [a] week _or_ [something] _when _they_ have_ school off ?

A|35| A: uh-huh . 
B|36| B: _when i_ lived [in] _washington_ [uh] _washington_ d c [i] _never_ _went to the_ _washington_ _memorial_ [and] _then_ _when i_ _went_ back [to] visit [i] _went to the_ _washington_ _memorial_ . 
A|37| A: _you know_ _i've_ heard _we_ [have a] _couple of_ _friends_ [that] goes [to] [washington] quite often _and that_ must [be] [the] _thing ._ [they] really hadn't either . [they] [went to the] [memorial] _you know [when_ _they] go_ _it's_ [on] business 
B|38| B: _right_ . 
A|39| A: _it's not_ really _just_ [to] _getting_ [to] sight _see_ . 
B|40| B: _right_ . [well] [it's] [it's] [a] beautiful city . 
A|41| A: [oh] [i] bet _it_ _is_ too . 
B|42| B: [but] [the] _problem_ [is] [like] first [time] [i] [went] _out of_ [here] _and they_ took me [to] las vegas 
A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| B: [and that] _was_ [the] most boring place [on] earth . 
A|45| A: [oh] [now] [my] husband _and i_ _we_ [go] different [places] _. but_ our [but] [when] _we_ [go] [with] our [children] _we_ usually kind [of] _stay_ close . 
B|46| B: [yeah .] did [uh] did [like] did [you] [go] [to] disneyland ? 
A|47| A: [oh] yes yes yes . 
B|48| B: [oh] _okay_ [. so] [but] um _now i_ _don't_ [know] [but] um [but] let's [see] _when i was_ [eleven] [i] [went] _also_ [to the] caribbean . 
A|49| A: [oh] . 
B|50| B: [and] [uh] _then_ _after_ _that i_ [my] sister lives [in] turkey [so] _when i was_ [like] fourteen fifteen [i] [went] [i] [went to] turkey . 
A|51| A: [oh] 
B|52| B: [and] _this_ christmas [i] [went to] turkey [. but] basically [it's] [a] _for_ [the] past [couple of] _years_ [i] since [my] parents [are] [are] [well] i'm from argentina [and my] parents live down there [. so] all [the] traveling [i] _do_ [is] alone . 
A|53| A: uh-huh . 
B|54| B: [and] [uh] [we] were _never_ _much_ [of] [uh] [a] _very_ [uh] family [thing] [you know] made [like] [go] skiing [in] vermont _or_ [something .] 
A|55| A: uh-huh . 
B|56| B: [that] _was_ [uh] [that] _was_ [a] lot [of] fun . 
A|57| A: yes . 
B|58| B: [but] [what] happens [is] [we] used [to] fight [a] lot [so there's] _never_ _much_ [of] [a] family family [thing .] [you know] one [of] those hell family vacations . 
A|59| A: [oh] yes [but] [we] _try_ _you know i_ _try_ [my] husband [also] we're involved [in] _everything_ our _kids_ [does] 
B|60| B: [yeah .] 
A|61| A: _because_ [uh] _my dad_ died _you know [when_ i was] less than _a [year_ old] 
B|62| B: [yeah .] 
A|63| A: [so] [i] [always] _just_ _had a_ mother [. so] [i] [always] thought [when _i] have kids_ _you know i_ really _want _to_ be_ involved _with them_ . 
B|64| B: [well] [my dad] all he all he wanted _to do_ [was] [get] _money_ _for_ _us_ [so] he could buy _us_ _material things_ . 
A|65| A: [material things] yes [that] [is] yes 
B|66| B: [and] [and] [to] me [you know] [it's] [like] [now] i'm twenty-two [but] [i] _still_ feel [you know] [it's] [like] [yeah] [we] _never_ threw [a] football _or_ [something] 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| B: [and] [the] way [i was] brought [up] [and] he wants me [now] he [like] he [you know] [like] he wants [to be] _best friends now_ 
A|69| A: [best friends [now] .] 
B|70| B: [and] [it's] _very_ hard _for_ me [because] [you know] [it's] [like] [you] grow [up] [to be] twenty _years_ [old] [and] [it's] [always] [the] same man 
A|71| A: uh-huh . 
B|72| B: [and] _then_ suddenly he sees [that] [he's] [getting] [old] [and] he wants [to be] [best friends] 
A|73| A: [yeah .] 
B|74| B: [but] [uh] [you know] [it's] [like] [i] _can_ only express myself [so] _much_ [because] [you know] um [everything] [that] he taught me [you know] [that] [my] family taught me [which] [is] _very_ hard [to] change [that] all [of] [a] sudden from one [year] [to the] next [and] say i'm sorry _you know ._ [it's] [like] [you know _i] love_ [you] [and] let's [go] _out_ [and] _do_ [things] together [when i] _don't_ feel [like] [it] [you know] 
A|75| A: uh-huh . 
B|76| B: [and] [so] [that's] [that] whole [thing] [that] he'll say [when] [like] [like] [i've] seen [my] uncle [and] his family [you know] [does] [everything] together _and you know_ his [kids] _are [you_ know when] his [little] girl [was] [five] _years_ [old] [and] [everything] [they] [uh] [they] [would] [go] [to the] beach [and] she could [go] [to] sleep [at] two [in the] morning [you know] 
A|77| A: [oh] uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|78| B: [and] [uh] [i was] brought [up] [the] same way [it] doesn't [matter] [what] age _you have_ [just] [so] long [as] _you can_ [get] [up] [to] [go] [to] class [the] next morning _you can_ [stay] [up] [you know] 
A|79| A: uh-huh . 
B|80| B: [but] his [what] he [does] [is] [when] he _gets_ home he separates his _work_ from his house . 
A|81| A: [yeah] [you _have] to_ 
B|82| B: [yeah .] 
A|83| A: _i mean you_ honestly [do] _. _now_ i have_ [friends] [that [i] love] [to] death [but] [and [they] have] [children] [but] their [children] [does] anything [we] _have to_ take _them_ [and you know] [to do] [it] . 
B|84| B: [yeah .] 
A|85| A: [and that] really [gets] kind [of] aggravating [after] [a] while [because] _you're_ _saying_ _well i_ [work] full [time] too [you know .] 
B|86| B: [yeah yeah] [but] [uh] [it's] [just] [it's] [just] [something] [that] [you know] [my] theory [is] [you know when] [when] [you [have] kids] [and] all [you] [you] [want [to] do] [well] [what] i'll [do] [is] [you know] [like] [i mean you] might [have] problems [but] [it's not] your kids' problems [you know] 
A|87| A: [yeah] [oh] [yeah .] 
B|88| B: [and you] got [to] [try] [to be [with] them] [as] _much_ [as] _you can_ [and] _to [you_ know] [like] [thing] [is] [is] [that] [you know] [like] [if] [if] [they] [would] ever happen [to] [have a] drug _problem_ suppose [that] [they] could feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] [saying] [i] got [a] _problem_ [you know] 
A|89| A: [problem] uh-huh 
B|90| B: [and] [uh] [and that] [would] make any parent feel _good_ [and] bad [at] [the] same [time] [you know] 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| B: first [of] all [you're] coming [to] me [and] let's [see] _how_ [we] _can_ [get] rid [of] [the] [problem] [you know] [and] [that's] [uh] [that's] _very_ [that's] _very_ hard [to do] [because] once [you're] [best friends] [with] your parents _then_ [i] think [everything] [go] [a] lot better . 
A|93| A: uh-huh _yeah i_ agree [with] [you] [very] [much] [so _.] now_ [we] waited several [years] [before] [we] started having [children] [because] [we] [was] [still] [in] _college and_ [we] knew [time] wise [or] [and] [money] wise too 
B|94| B: [yeah .] 
A|95| A: [would] [it] [would] [not] [have] [been] [a] [good] idea [to] _had_ [them] [then] . 
B|96| B: [yeah] [my] [my] father [was] raising four [oh] [well] three [kids] [before] he [had] me [so] [it] [was] [uh] [you know] [you're] trying [to] support [uh] four [kids] [and] [it's] pretty hard [you know] 
A|97| A: [yeah .] 
B|98| B: [and i] [i] told him listen [you] could [have] [had a] lot [of] [money] _if you_ [would] [have] only [had] two [kids] . 
A|99| A: uh-huh [yeah .] 
B|100| B: he says [yeah] [but] [then] [i] wouldn't [have] [you] [i] [go] [yeah] [but] [then] [you] [would] [have a] lot [of] [money] 
A|101| A: [that's] [right] _but you_ can't take [this] [money] [with] [us] though 
B|102| B: [yeah .] 
A|103| A: [that's] [how] [i] keep _looking_ [at] [it] . 
B|104| B: [but [you] know] [like] four [i mean] four [children] [is] expensive especially [when] [you] consider [like] especially _for_ me [which] i'm paying _out of_ state tuition . i'm paying [you know] three thousand [no] [what] [is] [it] two thousand six hundred dollars _for_ one semester . 
A|105| A: [oh] . 
B|106| B: [and you know] people say [you know] [it's] expensive [to] think [it's] [college] [but] [if] [if] everybody [would] [be] [a] [little] bit responsible [you know] [it's] [like] [what] [does] [it] [what] [does] [it] cost . [it] costs [five] hundred dollars [a] semester suppose [. now] [they go] [to] [a] state [college [and] they] live [at] home [you know] 
A|107| A: uh-huh . 
B|108| B: [and] [well] [it] costs two hundred dollars _for_ books [but [you] know] seven hundred dollars [a] semester [a] lot [of] people _can_ spare [that] [if] [they] planned ahead [you know] [like] 
A|109| A: [oh] [yeah] [if you] [if [you] can] [yeah .] 
B|110| B: [i mean] [it's] [like] [if you] plan [a year] ahead [you can] probably save [up] seven hundred dollars [you know] one thousand four hundred dollars [to] send your child [to] [college] [you know .] 
A|111| A: [yeah .] [what are you] learning [to be] ? 
B|112| B: [oh oh] excuse me ? 
A|113| A: [what] degree [i mean] [what are you] wanting [to do] [after] [you] _get [out_ of] [college] ? 
B|114| B: [well i] i'm [doing] computer science computer engineering . 
A|115| A: [oh] [that's] [my] husband's into [uh] computers . 
B|116| B: [yeah] [and] [and] [now] i'm [looking] _for_ [a] job [before] [they [have] to] send me back home 
A|117| A: uh-huh . 
B|118| B: [because] since i'm an international student [they] [want to] send me back [to] argentina . 
A|119| A: [yeah .] 
B|120| B: [well] [my dad] wants me [to] [go] back [. [so] .] 
A|121| A: [and _you] don't_ [want to] ? 
B|122| B: [no .] 
A|123| A: [no] [no .] 
B|124| B: [no] [because] [if you] [go] back there [then] [you can] _never_ [get out] . 
A|125| A: [oh] . 
B|126| B: [like] [you don't] [have] any [money] [to] [to] [get out] . 
A|127| A: [oh] . 
B|128| B: [so] [uh] [and] [uh] [i was] thinking [you know] [like] [oh] [my] god [you know i] [go] back there [and] [then] [and i] [get] married there [and] [now [i have] kids] there [and] [then] i'll _never leave_ [the] place [you know .] 
A|129| A: [then] you'll [never leave] . 
B|130| B: [yeah i] [know] [and] [that's] [that's what] happened [to] [my] brother . he came [to] school [up] [here] [and] [then] [when] he [went] down there he [was] [just] [so] bad off [you know] from [not] being able [to] [stay] [up] [here] [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
A|131| A: [oh] . uh-huh . 
B|132| B: [so .] 
A|133| A: [well] maybe [something] will open [up] [for] [you] . 
B|134| B: [yeah] [i've] [been] calling [a] lot [of] companies . there some [of] [them] [are] interested . [well] [at] least [for] [a year] [and] [a] half [i] [can] [work] 
A|135| A: uh-huh . 
B|136| B: [so .]
