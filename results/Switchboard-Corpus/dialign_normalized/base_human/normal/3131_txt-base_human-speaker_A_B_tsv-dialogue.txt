A|0| A: we're _to_ discuss _a little bit_ _about_ _the_ process _of_ putting _someone_ _in a_ nursing _home and_ making _the_ decision _on_ _a_ _family_ basis _and_ probably _the_ _first_ question would _be_ _whether_ you've _ever_ _had_ _to_ _go_ through _that_ process . 
B|1| B: _well_ _not_ _so much_ personally _but_ _my_ _um_ husband _has_ an aunt who _has_ _been_ _like_ [a] second _mother_ _i_ mean _always_ lived _in the_ same town [and] took _care_ [of] him [and] such . _they_ _live_ _down _in_ college station_ _where_ his parents _do_ too _. _and_ they_ put _her_ [in a] [home] last year . 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|3| B: _she_ appeared [to] _have_ [a] couple [of] light strokes [and] started [to] uh _not_ [be] _able _to_ be_ [in] _her_ apartment [on] _her_ own . 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _so_ _they_ found [a] [a] place nearby [that] _they_ put _her_ [in] last year . 
A|6| A: [so] _it was_ _pretty much_ [a] physical decision ? 
B|7| B: uh _yeah_ although _she_ _is_ uh [in] [pretty] good _health_ [and] _she's_ doesn't _take_ any medication _it's just_ _she_ [had] [had] _her_ own apartment [and] drove [a] car [and] everything up _until_ _that point_ . 
A|8| A: _um ._ 
B|9| B: _then_ _she was_ starting [to] get uh _you know_ lose memory _sometimes_ [and] _which is_ _kind of_ _frightening_ _when_ _she's_ _in the_ car . 
A|10| A: _yeah ._ 
B|11| B: uh 
A|12| A: [my] husband's _family_ _are_ reaching [that point] _but it's it's so_ difficult . [was] [she] [in] favor _of it_ _or_ _or_ [was] [she] [kind of] opposed _to it_ ? 
B|13| B: _well_ [yeah] _when_ [it] finally came _down_ [to it] [um] _she just_ got _to the_ [point] after [the] _i_ mean [it] _wasn't a_ _very_ [um] strong stroke . [it was] _just_ [kind of] _all of a sudden_ [she] _wasn't_ _herself_ anymore . 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [and] [she] got [kind of] fearful [of] _being_ [on] _her_ own _. she_ _never_ _really_ ate _very_ _well_ . [it was] one thing _. she_ hardly [ever] took _care_ [of] _herself_ 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [and] [she] _didn't_ eat _. she_ ate _very_ poor [so] _i think_ _she was_ _you know_ _bad_ uh nutrition [on] top [of it] _. and_ uh [she] got _to the_ [point] [she] _didn't want to_ alone anymore _. so_ 
A|18| A: [so] often [i think] though elderly _people_ _don't_ realize [that] _their_ diet [is] [that] [bad] . [i] work _with_ [a] lot [of] elderly _people_ i'm [a] trust officer 
B|19| B: [um .] 
A|20| A: _and so_ often [they] [think] _they're_ adequately caring _for_ themselves [when] _they're really_ [not] eating [very] [much] _or_ [very] balanced _meals ._ 
B|21| B: _well _she_ was_ almost ridiculous . _like_ she'd eat ice cream [and] cookies . she'd 
A|22| A: yes . [well] [you know] _that's_ part _of the_ aging process [that] _your_ taste buds goes back [to the] sweet taste . 
B|23| B: _didn't_ one 
A|24| A: [it] [really] [is] . 
B|25| B: _oh_ [really] ? 
A|26| A: _yeah ._ _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _well she_ _didn't want to_ cook [for] _herself_ anymore . 
A|28| A: _yeah ._ 
B|29| B: _oh_ [that's] too [much] trouble _. that's_ too [much] trouble . _didn't want to_ cook . 
A|30| A: [and] [the] portions _people_ _don't want to_ try [to] figure _out_ _little_ bitty individual _meals ._ [i] [do] [that] right now 
B|31| B: [yeah .] 
A|32| A: [and] i'm [not] near nursing [home] age . 
B|33| B: although _they've_ got uh [meals] [on] wheels _which_ [i] understand [is] [a] [really] good [you know] _way_ [to] handle [that] [so] [that] at least [they] eat . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] _uh-huh [._ so] _as a_ _family_ [you] [all] [just] visited nursing homes _or_ probably [in college station] _there_ [wasn't a] _whole_ lot [of] choice . 
B|35| B: no [i] [don't] [think] [there] [was] . [um] [i] [know] [a little bit] more _from_ [a] [a] co-worker . _her_ mother-in-law [had] _been in_ [for] quite _some_ time [and] [had] _different_ degrees _of a_ place [that] _she _was_ _in_ ._ 
A|36| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|37| B: [um] _she was_ ambulatory [and so] [there] [was] [a] lesser _care_ . uh _then_ [she] got uh uh hip broken _and then_ uh [she] [wasn't] [as] ambulatory [so] [they] were almost [you know] [to the] [point] [of] saying _she can't_ [be] here anymore . 
A|38| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: [but] [i] remember _from her_ checking around [she] ended up staying at [the] arkansas house [i think] [out] [in] arlington _something_ _like_ [that] . 
A|40| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|41| B: [and] uh [you know] [the] type [of] facilities [whether] [it's] [a] shared room [or] two separate rooms [that] share uh [a] uh bathroom . _all of_ them [all] seem [to] _say_ [that] [people] [there] [are] _going to_ steal [their] items 
A|42| A: [oh] [yeah [.] that's] [a] given . 
B|43| B: [they're] _always_ saying [that] somebody's _going to_ _and some of_ them [i think] unconsciously [do] [it] [you know] [as a] [just] [you know] half 
A|44| A: _uh-huh [._ and] [sometimes] [the] [the] help [there] _does_ [it] [i think] . 
B|45| B: uh [so] _they they_ uh [don't] _have_ too _many_ facilities [it] _seems_ [for] [their] personal items . [very] limited space waste 
A|46| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|47| B: [but] [um] at least [they] [all] seem [to] _have_ uh [you know] [people] [that] monitor [their] uh medication intake [and] dining facilities [you know] [go] [to the] dining room _and and_ eat _some_ good [meals .] 
A|48| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|49| B: [i] [know] [when] [my] friend's mother-in-law [first] went [in] [i] mean [very] antisocial . maybe [it] takes [a] _while_ [for] them [to] _say_ _okay_ [well] i'll [be] [with] other [people] [but] 
A|50| A: adapt . 
B|51| B: [yeah] [i] [don't] understand [that] _they they_ [don't _want to] be_ [with] anybody else . 
A|52| A: [yeah .] [i] [as] [i think] [i] mentioned [i] [was [in] the] trust business [and] i've seen [so] [many] elderly _people ._ usually [there] [has] [to be] [some] wealth involved [which is] great if if you're financially if if [you] [don't] make [the] decisions [so] late [that] you're worried _about_ money [but] [the] [the] places [like] presbyterian village [and some _of] the_ [the] retirement places [where] [where] [they] [have] [different] levels [of] [care] [seems] [to be] [so much] better [as] far [as] elderly [people] adapting . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [they're] [able _to] move_ [in] [while] [they're] still independent [and] still social 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and [and] they] [do] group things [. [and] then] if [health] [or] [or] mental capacity deteriorates [they're] [able to] [take] [the] next steps without [so much] change [and] [oh] [i] wish everybody _could_ [go] [that] direction rather than [just] [all of a sudden] moving _out of the_ [home] [they've] [always] [been [in] .] [it's] [really] [kind of] difficult . 
B|57| B: [yeah] [i] [have] [a] [um] [my] aunt's _mother_ [is] uh gotten ill recently [and] uh [she] lives [in] pennsylvania [they] _live_ [in] alabama [. and] [they're] saying hey _we_ need [you] [to be] closer [and] [you] [have] women [like] [that] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [i] [don't] [to] men [it] [seems] [like] [the] women [out] [just] [out] _live_ [their] husbands [but] [very] reluctantly [that] [whole] [i] mean 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [they] [don't] get [out of the] house [they] [don't] socialize [but it's] [my] [home and] [i] [don't want to] leave [it] . 
A|62| A: [well] _and it's_ [the] [first] step [in] [in] actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing [and and] aging . 
B|63| B: uh . 
A|64| A: [you know] once [you] make [that] step [you know] [that] [it's just] [going [to] be] downhill [from] [then] [on] [and and] i've seen [people] [really] fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to] make [the] change . 
B|65| B: [um .] 
A|66| A: [they they] became [in] fact [that's] probably what's [going to] happen [with] [my] husband's [mother] . [she's] [going to] endanger [herself] before she'll willingly [and] probably will [never] willingly make [the] decision [. and] [that] scares _me_ [the] [the] _thought_ [of] forcing somebody [to] [do] [something] . 
B|67| B: [but it's it's so] lonely [you know] [they] _can't_ get [out] [and] _see_ anyone [and] [i] mean [it's] hard [for] [for] [someone] [like] [me] [to] understand [that] 
A|68| A: [yeah .] 
B|69| B: _because_ [i] [i think] what [do] [you] [have] [there] ? [it's] [a] house 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [it's] walls [and it's] furniture [but] there's nobody _there ._ 
A|72| A: [not] [as] _independence ._ 
B|73| B: [don't] [you] _want to be_ close [to] [me] ? [i] mean [you know] [be] [with] other [people .] 
A|74| A: [yeah .] 
B|75| B: [i] [just] [don't] understand why [they] [so much] [want to] [just] stay [in] [that] building . 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [and] there's no [family] [there] [they] [don't] get [to] _see_ [their] grandkids [they] [don't] get [to] _see_ [their] children [they] [just] [there] [in] [that] house . 
A|78| A: [yeah [.] and] [the] quality [of] life [really] isn't [there .] 
B|79| B: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [oh] [it's] tough [it] [really] [is] . 
B|81| B: [that's] [from] [the] child's standpoint . [the] child [is] [going] why [don't] [you] _want to be_ close [to] [me] [and] [your] other [family] . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: what [does] [that] house got attraction ? 
A|84| A: [well] [they] fear [being] dependent [on] somebody . 
B|85| B: [i] [know] [they're really] proud [of] [independence .] 
A|86| A: [they they] fear [being] [a] burden [to] [to] [family] members . 
B|87| B: uh . 
A|88| A: [my] husband's [mother] will [have] major surgery [and] _we'll_ find [out] _about_ [it] [in a] casual conversation . she'll let [something] slip [and] _we'll_ [say] wait [a] minute [. [and] and] [that's] [it] [she just] [well] [i] [didn't want to] bother [you] [. [she] can't] accept [that] [we] [want to be] [the] [care] givers . 
B|89| B: [well] [when] [she] got [home] who took [care] [of] _her_ ? 
A|90| A: [yeah .] [well she] stayed [she] stayed [in a] temporary nursing [home] . [until] [she was] [okay] . 
B|91| B: [oh] . 
A|92| A: [you know] [it's just] [but it's] [frightening] [to] us [because] [we] [live] [pretty] far [from her] . [she's] [down in] temple 
B|93| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [and] [we] [can't] [see] [her] often enough [to] [really] [know] what's [going] [on] . 
B|95| B: [um] 
A|96| A: [so] [it's] difficult [it] [really] [is] [and] we're [all] heading [that] [way] [and] 
B|97| B: [yeah] [my] husband [and] [i] [we] [have] [been] thinking [about] his folks [are] [in college station] [and] we've [pretty much] planned [that] [we'll] [be] here [in the] dallas area [and] there's nothing [to] hold them [there] [in college station] since [they're] retired . 
A|98| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|99| B: [so] [we] [thought] maybe [we] [could] get them [to move] [a little] closer here . 
A|100| A: [yeah]
