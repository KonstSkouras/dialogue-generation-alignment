A|0| A: _okay ._ 
B|1| B: [okay _.] well_ _uh_ anyways _i'm not_ _exactly_ _sure_ _i_ _i_ wasn't _really_ _uh_ paying attention _as_ _to_ _what_ particular _uh_ parts _of_ capital punishment _we're_ _supposed to_ talk _about_ _but_ _it was_ _uh_ basically what's your views _on_ _whether_ _you_ thought _there_ _was_ certain _cases_ _that_ _should be_ used _that_ sort _of_ thing ? 
A|2| A: _yeah ._ 
B|3| B: right _. and_ _uh _i_ don't know_ _i've_ _i've_ _always_ thought _that_ _any_ _uh_ crime _that uh_ _that uh_ intentionally where _someone_ goes _out_ _and_ premeditatively takes _another_ _life_ _would be_ _the_ ones where _i think that_ capital punishment _would be_ necessary _to_ keep _that person_ _from_ perhaps _uh_ doing _it again_ _and even_ more _so_ _to_ _get_ _people_ _on the_ outside _who_ _are_ professionals _to_ realize _that you know_ _there's_ _a_ _a_ _very_ steep penalty _to_ _uh_ _be_ paid when _that's_ done 
A|4| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _and_ _uh_ _. yeah_ _how_ _do you_ _feel_ _about _it_ ?_ 
A|6| A: [uh i] believe _in_ [it] _too_ 
B|7| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|8| A: [i'm] catholic [and] [we're] [not] [supposed to] _but [uh_ i] _feel that_ [it] _like_ [you] [you know] [on the] premeditated murders [i] [feel] _if_ you're _you know i mean_ _if_ _it's_ beyond [a] doubt [that you] did _it _you know_ i_ [would] _say_ _go_ ahead [and] execute [that person] [as] [well] . 
B|9| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [but] _it's_ [the] [cases] [you know] _like_ sometimes [you] _you know _you_ hear_ [of] _people _that_ they_ _say_ _they_ went [to] jail falsely [you know] _they_ [really] didn't [do] _it [._ well] _you know you_ [you] got [you] got [that] point [well] [you know] [what] [what] _if_ [a] mistake _is_ _made_ _and you_ put [someone] _you know _to_ death_ [that] [really] didn't [do] _it ._ 
B|11| B: right _exactly ._ 
A|12| A: _there's always_ [that] chance [i don't know] [but] [i] [would] _say_ [that _you know] for_ [that] many _people to_ _all_ [of] _them_ agree [that you] did [it] [and] [it was] premeditated [it] [would be] kind [of] hard _for_ [you know] 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [you know] [what] [i'm] _saying_ ? _like_ 
B|15| B: right . [if] [if] [the] evidence wasn't overwhelming right ? 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _so [uh_ i] 
B|19| B: _well _i_ think that_ _should be_ _likewise_ decided by [the] jury [you know] because _i don't _know i_ think_ [a] jury [would be] _less_ likely [to] _just_ send [a] man [to death] _just_ [for] _any_ _reason_ 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [i don't know] [a] judge _might_ [be] [a] little more cold-blooded _about [it_ .] 
A|22| A: [exactly _.] uh_ [i'm not] [sure] [about] _pennsylvania_ [whether] _we have_ [it] _or_ [not] . [for] _some_ [reason] _i was_ thinking [that] _we_ [do] [but] _it's_ [you know] _it's_ [not] [very] often _. i think_ _maybe_ last _year_ [was] [the] first time _in_ _like_ eighteen years _or_ something _like _that_ that_ anyone anyone [from] _pennsylvania_ _had_ _gotten_ [it .] 
B|23| B: [yeah] _i don't think_ [we] 
A|24| A: [i don't] [do _you] know if_ _virginia_ _has_ [it ?] 
B|25| B: no huh-uh . no [we] [don't] . 
A|26| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: [yeah .] 
A|28| A: [i] [know] _florida_ _has_ [it .] 
B|29| B: [uh-huh _.] oh_ [yeah] _they're_ [always] [in] [florida] . [florida] [and] louisiana [i think] [and] [uh] _some _of_ the_ _other_ southern states . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] .] 
B|31| B: course _they have_ such [a] crime problem because _they have_ such [a] unemployment rate . 
A|32| A: _uh you know_ 
B|33| B: _get_ [that] unemployment _way_ up [so] _then_ [people] [you know] tend towards crime _and then they_ [they] start stiffening [the] penalties . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] [but] _it's_ funny [that [uh] _i] mean_ _like_ [you know] _like i said_ [i think] last _year_ [was] [the] first time [in] _like_ eighteen years [for] _pennsylvania_ . [i'm not] [even] [sure] [of] [that] [but] [for] [some] [reason] [i think [that] you know] [it was] something _like _that_ [._ and] [it] surprised [and even] [florida] [i] [know] [they have] [it] _and you_ _don't really_ _hear [about_ it] real often [how] many [people] 
B|35| B: [well] [in] [florida] seems [like] [uh] _two_ [or] _three_ times [a] [year] . [it's] constantly [on the] 
A|36| A: [yeah] [but] [you] [you] [think that] _i mean_ [if] [you] [think] [of] [how] many premeditated murders [are] committed [you know] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] [how] many _people are_ being sent [that] doesn't seem [like] [very] many . 
B|37| B: [yeah .] no _that's true_ . course [they _have] a_ requirement [that uh] [that] every single _appeal_ must [be] permitted . 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [so] [of] course [the] [the] attorneys 
A|40| A: _everyone_ [would] [appeal] _. that's true_ _too_ . 
B|41| B: [they] [go] [all] [the] _way_ up [to] [the] supreme court _you know ._ 
A|42| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [they] almost [always] _get_ thrown right back _out_ _again_ [but] [they have] [to] [have] every single [appeal] [made] open [to] _them ._ 
A|44| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] .] 
B|45| B: _some of_ these guys [are] [really] [uh you know] violent son [of] sam killers _and stuff_ [like [that] _you know] ._ 
A|46| A: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [i mean] [they] 
A|48| A: [and then they] _get out ._ 
B|49| B: [everyone] knows _they're_ _going_ [get] [not] _going to_ [get out .] 
A|50| A: [yeah] [they] [get out] [in] [three] years [on] probation 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: [and] [they] [do] [it again] [you know .] 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [it's] [like] [a] slap [on the] fingers [for] [them .] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [i don't] [i don't] [i don't] [i think that] [it] [should be] [i mean] [if] [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] [someone] did premeditate [someone] [a] _murder_ [then] [i think] _you know _that_ they_ [should] [likewise] [you know] [someone] [should] take _their_ [life] also . _but uh_ [but] _are _are_ you_ [would] [you] draw [the] line [there] _with_ [just] [the] premeditated _murder_ ? 
B|57| B: [i think] [so] . 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [uh] [a] lot _of the_ [the] [the] _other_ violent crimes [i [don't] really] [feel that] strongly [about] . although [you know] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [i mean] these guys [are] certainly [not] _going to_ [uh] [be] [they] _can't_ [i mean] _they're_ getting _into_ drugs [and] fights [and] [all] [that] _stuff_ [in] prison [. _i] don't think_ [the] parole system [is] [really] helping [that] much 
A|62| A: [yeah .] 
B|63| B: reduce [the] violence _in the_ prisons [. i think] [that's] its _only_ purpose [is] [is] [you know to] reduce [uh] [the] violence _in the_ prisons [so] [people] behave themselves [a] little bit _better_ [if] [they] [think] _they're_ _going to_ [get] off early . off earlier . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] .] 
B|65| B: [but] _some of_ these guys [just] [don't] care [you know [.] and] [so uh] 
A|66| A: [i think] [some of] [them] [would] rather [be] [in] jail 
B|67| B: [yeah] right [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [yeah .] [they] probably [have] [it] [better] [in] jail than [what] _they would_ [out] [in the] streets . 
B|69| B: um [that's] possible [i] guess . 
A|70| A: [i don't know] [uh _i] was just_ [going to] _say_ something [i] forgot [what] [it was] [. oh] [i don't] [even] remember [what] [it was] now . 
B|71| B: um [so] where [do you] _live in_ [pennsylvania] ? 
A|72| A: [in] clarion [. [well] i] [live in] butler [but] [i'm] _at_ [i'm] _at_ college . [i'm] _at_ clarion _university_ . 
B|73| B: [oh] [okay [.] _i] don't think_ [i] [really] [know [that] .] 
A|74| A: [yeah] 
B|75| B: because [uh [you know] that] [all] depends [too] [on] where [you] [are] [at] [. that's] [uh] sort [of] interesting [to] [get] opinions [as] [to] where different parts _of the_ country [are] . because [the] more grass root country [uh] parts _of the_ country tend [to] [to] support capital punishment where [the] places [that] [are [you] know] _less_ [in] contact [with] crime [you know] [the] [the] more more urban [i mean] _less_ 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] see [yeah] [okay] [well] see [i'm] [i'm] [in] kind [i'm] [in] kind [okay] [uh] [we] [only] [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [yeah] [and] [that] [would be] pushing [it .] [so] [i mean] this [is] definitely [a] college town _. uh_ [we're] [about] _two hours_ north [of] pittsburgh [if] [that] [would] help [you] [out] [any] _. uh_ 
B|79| B: [two hours] where ? 
A|80| A: north [of] pittsburgh [pennsylvania] . 
B|81| B: [oh] [okay .] near _polk_ ? 
A|82| A: [oh] [i've] never heard [of] [polk] [but] 
B|83| B: [polk] institute . [it's] [uh] _an_ old [uh] [university] [that] turned _into_ [a] place [for] [the] mentally retarded [. uh] 
A|84| A: [oh] [i] never heard [of] [that .] 
B|85| B: [very] old [uh] historical place [there] . 
A|86| A: [it] [might] [have a] new name . 
B|87| B: _sharon_ pennsylvania's up [there] . 
A|88| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|89| B: [yeah .] 
A|90| A: [we're] probably [about] [an] hour away [from] [sharon] . 
B|91| B: [oh] [okay .] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh [.] uh] [so] [i] most [of the] _kids_ _here_ [i] [you know] [like] [you know] [just] [from] dorm mates [and stuff] they'll _say_ _that they_ [don't] believe [in] [it] [but] [then] after [i] [would] _say_ _my_ point [of] view [then] they'll _say_ [well] [yeah] _you know [you know_ .] 
B|93| B: [in] [that] case [maybe] [you know .] 
A|94| A: [yeah .] _you [know i_ think] [people] _can be_ persuaded one [way] [or] [another] . [i've] never seriously ran [into] [someone] [i mean] [like] [other] than _my_ priest [you know] [who] definitely says _you can't_ take [a] _you know _you_ can't_ take anyone's [life] [. uh] anyone _that is_ [like] [so] against [it] [that you] couldn't persuade [them] [in] [any] instance . 
B|95| B: right [. that's true] [. yeah] [well] [it] [it [you know] you] [get] certain circumstances where [you [hear] about] these [people that] [have] [you know] stolen [kids] [and [you] know] done terrible things [to] [them] [and] killed [them] [and [you] know that] sort [of] thing 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [you] [just] [like [i] don't] want [that person] sharing [the] earth [with] me [you know i mean] [that is] [just] terrible . 
A|98| A: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|99| B: [and] [uh you know] [we] [had] [a] case [like that] [here] [and] [on the] [other] hand [you know] [people are] [saying] [that] because [the] he knows because [the] criminals [know that] [the] [uh] penalties [can be] [very] severe [they] [uh] [there's] _less_ criminals [that] [are [you] know] turning themselves [in] [or] [you know] pleading [or] whatever because [they] [know that] [the] judge [you know if] [they] find [them] _guilty_ [is] [you know] [has] [the] [the] opportunity [to] sentence [them] [you know for] [for] [the] [death] sentence . 
A|100| A: [yeah] 
B|101| B: [yeah [.] well] [i'm] [just] [saying] [that that] [that's] [what] [the] [the] client lawyers [are] [saying] . _they're_ [saying] [that [you know] you know] more [of] [my] clients [would] [have] pleaded _guilty_ [if] [they would] [have] [gotten] [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly having [to] [to] [to] [get] [a] [death] sentence because [you can't] _plea bargain_ [what] [the] sentence [is] [going to] [be] . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh [.] [yeah] [.] that's] something [you know] _but uh_ [whether] [they] [plea bargain] [or] [not] [if] [they're] [guilty] [of] _murder_ [they're] [guilty] [of] _murder_ [you know .] 
B|103| B: right [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [so] [i don't [think] _that] they_ deserve anything [less] 
B|105| B: [yeah] right . 
A|106| A: [it's] [just] [i don't] [i don't know i] [just] 
B|107| B: [uh-huh [.] [i] was just] [saying] [that] [way] [what] [they're] [saying] [is] [that they] [can't] [get] [people to] turn themselves [in] [then] [. and] [so] [we have] [to] [go] through [a] trial [then] [to] prove [the] person's [guilty] . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh] [and] [that] costs money [yeah .] 
B|109| B: [and] perhaps [we] [can] [and] perhaps [we] [can't] [and] [so] [the] guy [might] [get] off . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [and] [uh] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are are] guys [that] [are [you] know] [going to] [get] caught anyways [but] [there's always] [a] few [of] those [people that] [are [you] know] lost [their] head [or] whatever . 
A|112| A: [yeah .] 
B|113| B: anyways [but uh] [. yeah] [we] [just] [had] [a] terrible case [in] [virginia] where [some] girl disappeared [and] [and] [the] guy [like i said] he [just] [uh] [said] [that] he took her [but] he won't admit [that] she died [or] whatever [and] he won't [say] where [the] body [is] because he knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know] mandatory [life] sentences [for] [murder] .
