A|62| A: [that's] [right [.] that's] [right .] [it's] _really_ _nice ._

A|64| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: _and i_ [and] [she] moves [it] [around] ever _other_ _day_ . 
A|66| A: [i'll] _have to_ admit [i don't] [i do] [my own] [yard] [. i _i] really [don't_ enjoy] [doing [that] [.] [i] enjoy] _having_ [a] [nice] looking [yard] 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: _i just_ [don't enjoy] [the] [work] [that] [it takes] [to [get] it] done . 
B|69| B: _uh-huh . yeah ._ 
A|70| A: _i had a_ [lawn] service _to do_ [my] [yard] [for] _me_ during [the] _real_ [hot] summer months [you know] _until_ [i] retired 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [and] _now_ [i] _i've_ lost [my] excuse [for] [that] [so [i] _have] to_ _for the_ last [couple of] _years_ _i've_ done [it] myself . 
B|73| B: [yeah .] sometimes [i] wish [i] could [get] _one of_ these [uh] chemical services [to] come _out_ [and] spray [for] weeds [and] fertilize [and] [all] [that] [and] _take_ [that] [one] step _out_ [of] . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh . yeah _.] _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ 
B|75| B: _but_ [uh] [they] _want_ _too much_ _money_ . 
A|76| A: [it] [is] _kind of_ _expensive_ [it] [is] . 
B|77| B: [yeah .] 
A|78| A: [of] course [the] chemicals themselves _when you_ buy [them] _they're_ _expensive_ [too .] 
B|79| B: [right _.] right ._ _but_ [it's] still _be_ quite [a] _bit_ cheaper _to do it_ yourself . 
A|80| A: [that's] [right .] _if _i_ have a_ _problem_ discipline _you know _i_ think_ _now_ boy _i really_ need [to get out] [you know] [and] apply [something] [you know] [and i] screw [around] [and] [don't] [do it] [or] _wait_ [too] [long] [or something] . 
B|81| B: [right] [and] [the] weed come [up] 
A|82| A: [that's] [right .] 
B|83| B: [and] [all] _of a_ sudden you've [got [to] _do] something_ else . 
A|84| A: [that's] [right .] _i'm_ _i'm_ _kind of_ bad [about] [that .] 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: [i] enjoyed _having_ [a] [lawn] service [but] _now_ [i have] [the time] [and _i] really_ _can't_ _i really_ [you know] [don't] [want to] spend [the] [money] _for [it_ .] 
B|87| B: [well] _if you_ [enjoy] [it] [too] [you know] _you [you_ can [get] out] [in the] _morning_ [when] _before_ [it] gets [hot] _and and_ [do it] [and] stuff [when you] [only] [have to] 
A|88| A: [yeah . that's] [right .] _i'm_ [not] limited [to] [just] mowing _it on_ saturday [morning] [you know]

B|91| B: [when] [the] days [start] getting _a little_ longer [you know] [you can] [i can] [start] [doing] [it in the] evening after [work] . 
A|92| A: [uh-huh [.] that's] [right .] 
B|93| B: [when] [they] [when] [they] switch [to] switch

A|110| A: [i don't] [really] _like to_ _put_ [a lot] chemicals [on] [it] [but] [then] [again] [i don't] [want] [the] [bugs] eating [it] upping either . 
B|111| B: [right _.] right [._ i i] [it] seems [like] [they] come [in] spurts . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .]

A|120| A: [uh-huh [.] that's] [right .] 
B|121| B: [they] devoured _it that_ quickly . 
A|122| A: absolutely [. they] [really] [go] through [it] 
B|123| B: [and] [they] _they [have_ a] [you] [a] [good] appetite 
A|124| A: [they] [really] _do [._ yeah .] 
B|125| B: [and] [they] [would] [you know [i] i] picked off [like] twenty _of _them_ and_

B|145| B: [but] [uh you know] [you can] improve [your] [own] soil [there]

A|148| A: [that's] [right] [you _you] [have_ to] [work] [on] . [you] [really] _do ._ 
B|149| B: [right [.] [and] you know] [if [i] i] _didn't_ [wait] [five] [years] [for it] [to] _be_ [good] [enough] grow [you know] [what] [i mean] 
A|150| A: [that's] [right .] [when we] [had] _our_ pool done [i had] [them] [to] leave [some] extra [loam] [you know] [for [my] garden] [so [i] had] [i had [a] lot of] [loam] [out there] [to] [start] [with] _i just_ turned [it all] [up and] mixed [it all] [up] together [with]

A|158| A: [like i] [say] _it's just_ 
B|159| B: [yeah .] i'd [like [to] get] _one of_ these [little] [small] ones [that] [you] [see] [in] [all] these gardening magazines . 
A|160| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh [._ it] _would be_ handy .

A|172| A: [uh-huh .] [oh yeah .] 
B|173| B: [and] [it's] [a] fairly large [one] [to] heave [it up] into [the] back [of the] van bring [it] [home] [and] check [it] back [and just] grab [it] [you know] [if [i] just] [go] [to] [my] garage [and] grab [it .]
