B|5| B: _yeah _._ _i_ have_ _two_ plots , one's [ten] [by] [ten] [and] one's [like] fifteen [by] _four_ . 
A|6| A: _i see ._ 
B|7| B: [it's] [a] _long_ skinny _one_ _and ,_ 
A|8| A: _yeah , you_ [do] _a lot_ _more_ area than [i _do] ._ _i've ,_ [all] _the_ rest _of_ _my_ _yard_ , _backyard is _, uh ,_ you know ,_ pool [and] decking [it's] [all] _the_ dirt [i _have] ,_ _left_ _in_ _my backyard_

A|12| A: [it] _is ,_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: [and] _especially_ _when_ [the] weather's _not_ _too_ _hot_ _or_ _, not_ raining _or_ whatever , 
A|14| A: _that's_ _right . yeah ._ 
B|15| B: _but_ [, uh ,] sometimes _i , i_ said [, i] sometimes [i] wish _i had_ [more] _space_ _you know ._

B|17| B: [i] grow _a lot of_ _things _,_ a lot of_ food .

A|20| A: _that's_ [right _.] that's_ [right _.] _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ _takes_ [a lot of] [room] . 
B|21| B: [and] _it _takes_ up_ _your_ _whole_ _space_ 
A|22| A: [it] _sure_ does [. i] _made_ mistake _one year_ [and] _planted_ [some] cantaloupe _, my_ goodness _, what_ [a] mistake [that] _was_ . 
B|23| B: _yeah . yeah _._ _they_ ,_ _they_ [just] run [all] over _, the_ place _, don't_ _they ,_ 
A|24| A: _they do ._ [well _,] _it_ was_ very _good_ _it just_ [takes _up] [, you know_ [,] _like] you_ _say_ [, a lot of] _your garden_ area . 
B|25| B: [right _.] right ._ 
A|26| A: [it's] _the first_ [and] _only_ _time_ _i've_ done [that _.] we_ [don't] [do] _anything_ exotic _we_ _just _do_ ,_ [oh ,] _tomatoes_ , bell _peppers ,_ _radishes and_ turnips [, _i] mean [,_ not] turnips , carrots _, beets_ _and things like that ._

B|33| B: [the first] [one] , [they] started _them_ _indoors_ _this_ [time] [. i] read _it ,_ 
A|34| A: [oh , i see .] 
B|35| B: [and] _so _i_ ,_ 
A|36| A: _okay_ _. we_ [don't] _start_ _anything_ [indoors] _we _,_ just_ _wait_ _until [,_ you know , the] weather warm [enough] [to] stick _it in the_ ground . 
B|37| B: [yeah _.] i [,_ uh [,] _i] guess_ _you can get_ an earlier harvest [by] _doing that_ , 
A|38| A: probably [so] [. _yeah _,] you can_ get_ [a] head _start_ _on_ _it ._ [like] ice [in] 
B|39| B: _but_ [, uh _,] sure_ [is] [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] [work] . 
A|40| A: _i guess [it_ _,] [it_ ,] might _would ,_ 
B|41| B: because _you got _to_ ,_ watch _them_ every _day_ _, and_ keep _them_ watered 
A|42| A: [yeah _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|43| B: _and _i_ , i don't_ _think_ _i'll_ _do _it_ again_

B|45| B: _oh , _yeah [._ yeah_ [,] [i] enjoy] [it [.] i] come _home_ from [work] _and _, and_ i_ usually [say] hello [to] [wife] [and] kids _, and_ _then_ [go] _out_ [and] fiddle [, you know [,] just] walk [around] [the] [yard] [and] _inspect it_ 
A|46| A: [sure] . [you got to] [inspect [it] [,] yeah .]

A|48| A: [sure] . 
B|49| B: _and i_ push [them] [on] swing . 
A|50| A: [sure] . 
B|51| B: _and [i_ i] mow _my own_ [lawn] . 
A|52| A: [yeah .] 
B|53| B: _and [i_ [do] _,] i don't_ [have _a] sprinkler system_ _. i , i _don't_ enjoy_ watering . 
A|54| A: _no_ . 
B|55| B: _especially_ , 
A|56| A: [i ,] [this] [is] [the first] [home] _we've_ lived [in] _we've_ _had [a_ sprinkler system] , 
B|57| B: [oh] how , 
A|58| A: [and] boy _, it_ [is] _really_ [nice] , 
B|59| B: [oh] . 
A|60| A: [it] [sure] beats dragging hoses [around] . 
B|61| B: [yeah , you can] [have] [it] come [on] [just] early [in the] _morning_ _. _and_ , and_ off [by] [the] [, you know ,] [by] _the time_ you're _up and_ _about_ . 
A|62| A: [that's] [right [.] that's] [right .] [it's] _really_ _nice ._ 
B|63| B: [yeah _.] i , i_ usually _get it_ started _for [my_ wife] 
A|64| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: _and [i_ _,] and_ [she] moves [it] [around] ever _other_ _day_ . 
A|66| A: [i'll] _have to_ admit [i don't] [, i do] [my own] [yard] [. i , _i] really [don't_ enjoy] [doing [that] [.] [i] enjoy] _having_ [a] [nice] looking [yard] , 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [i] [just] [don't enjoy] [the] [work] _, that_ [it takes] [to [get] it] done . 
B|69| B: _uh-huh . yeah ._ 
A|70| A: _i had a_ [lawn] service _to do_ [my] [yard] [for] _me_ during [the] _real_ [hot] summer months [, you know _,] until_ [i] retired 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [and] _now_ [i ,] _i've_ lost [my] excuse [for] [that] [so [i] _have] to_ _for the_ last [couple of] _years_ _i've_ done [it] myself . 
B|73| B: [yeah .] sometimes [i] wish [i] could [get] _one of_ these [, uh ,] chemical services [to] come , _out_ [and] spray [for] weeds _, and_ fertilize _, and_ [all] [that] [and] _take_ [that] [one] step _out_ [of] . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh . yeah _.] _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ 
B|75| B: _but_ [, uh ,] [they] _want_ _too much_ _money_ . 
A|76| A: [it] [is] _kind of_ _expensive_ _, it_ [is] . 
B|77| B: [yeah .] 
A|78| A: [of] course [, the] chemicals themselves _when you_ buy _them _,_ they're_ _expensive_ [too .] 
B|79| B: [right _.] right ._ _but_ [it's] still _be_ quite [a] _bit_ cheaper _to do it_ yourself . 
A|80| A: [that's] [right .] _if _i_ have a_ _problem_ discipline _, you know _, i_ think ,_ _now ,_ boy [, _i] really_ need [to get out] [, you know [,] and] apply [something [,] you know [,] and i] screw [around] [and] [don't] [do it] [or] _wait_ [too] [long] [or something] . 
B|81| B: [right] [and] [the] weed come [up ,] 
A|82| A: [that's] [right .] 
B|83| B: [and] [all] _of a_ sudden you've [got [to] _do] something_ else . 
A|84| A: [that's] [right .] _i'm_ , _i'm_ _kind of_ bad [about] [that .] 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: [i] enjoyed _having_ [a] [lawn] service [but] _now_ [i have] [the time] [and _i] really_ _can't [,_ _i] really_ [you know [,] don't] , [want to] spend [the] [money] _for [it_ .] 
B|87| B: [well ,] _if _you_ ,_ [enjoy] [it] _too [,_ you know _,] you [, you_ can [get] out] [in the] _morning_ [when] _, before_ [it] gets [hot] _and , and_ [do it] [and] stuff , [when you] [only] [have _to] ,_ 
A|88| A: [yeah . that's] [right .] _i'm_ [not] limited [to [,] just] mowing _it on_ saturday [morning] [, you know ,] 
B|89| B: [right .] 
A|90| A: _i can_ [do _it] on_ most _any_ [day] _of the_ week . 
B|91| B: [when] [the] days [start] getting _a little_ longer [, you know [,] you _can] [,_ [i] can] [start] [doing] [it in the] evening after [work] . 
A|92| A: [uh-huh [.] that's] [right .] 
B|93| B: [when] _they ,_ [when] [they] switch [to ,] switch , 
A|94| A: [yeah .] 
B|95| B: _when we_ [get] an hour [more] , 
A|96| A: [yeah .]

B|109| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [i don't] [really] _like to_ _put_ [a lot] chemicals [on] [it] [but] _then ,_ [again] [, i don't] [want] [the] [bugs] eating [it] upping either . 
B|111| B: [right _.] right [._ i [, i] [,] it] seems [like] [they] come [in] spurts . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [one year] [i] _didn't_ [put] [anything] [on] [and i] _didn't have_ [any] problems .

B|119| B: [i mean [,] i] went [up [,] i] _didn't_ [go] _out there_ [for] [about] three days [, you know ,] because [i [,] and i] went _out there_ [one] [day] [and] [the] [plant] [was] nothing [left] [but] [a] stem , 
A|120| A: [uh-huh [.] that's] [right .] 
B|121| B: [they] devoured _it that_ quickly . 
A|122| A: absolutely [. they] [really] [go] through [it ,] 
B|123| B: _and ,_ _they ,_ _they ,_ [have _a] _,_ you [,_ a] [good] appetite 
A|124| A: [they] [really] _do [._ yeah .] 
B|125| B: [and] [they] [would [,] you know [, i] , i] picked off [like] twenty _of _them_ _and_ ,_

B|135| B: [right .] 
A|136| A: [and [,] you know ,] various [other] [things ,] raised _it _up_ ._ 
B|137| B: [well [,] the] [good] stuff [. right .] 
A|138| A: [and] [i'm] hoping [especially] [with] [those] big tall sides [on] [there] [it that] maybe [i] won't _have ,_ [oh ,] [i'll] [have] less [of a] bug _problem_ at least [they ,] they'll [have a] hard [time] crawling [up] [the] thing . 
B|139| B: [right [. yeah] [,] [my] [backyard] is , uh ,] [is] sloping [so i] built [a box] [up , you know] [had] [to] build [the] [one] [, the] low _side_ [up .]

A|158| A: [like i] [say] [it's] [just] , 
B|159| B: [yeah .] i'd [like [to] get] _one of_ these [little] [small] ones [, that] [you] [see] [in] [all] these gardening magazines .
