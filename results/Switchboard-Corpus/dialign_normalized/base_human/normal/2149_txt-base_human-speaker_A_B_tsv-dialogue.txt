A|0| A: _or_ _so_ _what_ _do_ _you_ _think_ ? _should_ _they uh_ _should_ _young_ americans _be forced_ _to do a year_ _of_ service ? 
B|1| B: _i don't_ _i don't_ [think] _they _should_ [be_ forced] _but _i_ think_ _they _should_ _be_ _i_ guess_ encouraged _to [to_ do] _some_ kind [of] public _work_ _i guess_ [to] _just _to_ get them_ _i guess_ _involved_ _with_ _community_ maybe _you know_ _just_ _community_ _activity_ . _if_ nothing _else_ _see_ _how_ _the city_ works _stuff like that ._ 
A|2| A: _yeah_ [i think] _something _like_ _the_ peace corps_ _is _a_ bit_ harsh . 
B|3| B: [yeah] 
A|4| A: _no_ _kids_ 
B|5| B: [i] kind [of] [i think] [so] _too _._ i think_ _that's_ [a bit] dramatic _but_ _but_ other than _that_ _i think it's_ _it's a_ _good_ idea _to get them_ _involved_ _in_ _city_ _and_ _community_ activities _and you know_ [like the] [uh] shelters _and uh_ _that_ kind [of] _thing_ helping _out_ [uh] volunteering _i guess if_ [they] _can_ . 
A|6| A: _yeah [. [i_ think] [it's] _a] little_ harsh [to] _say_ [that] _they should have to_ _spend _a_ year_ _or_ two . 
B|7| B: [yeah .] 
A|8| A: [i] [i] i'd force [them] [. i _think] that_ [uh] _i think it_ _would_ [be _i] think i think _a lot of_ kids_ actually _do _a_ lot of_ [work] [and] _no_ _one_ [just] realizes _it ._ 
B|9| B: your _right_ [i] [do] _too_ [i think] [they] start _out_ [young] [like] _in uh_ girl scouts [and] _boy_ scouts [a] video _doing_ 
A|10| A: [right] exactly [. i] _was_ [a] [i] _was_ [a] [boy] scout . _as_ part [of] being [a] [boy] scout [you] had [to do] [you know] projects _all_ throughout _and then_ [to] become an eagle scout [you] _have to_ _spend a_ _do a_ yearlong project . 
B|11| B: [right] _that's_ _see_ _that's_ [what] _we_ _did_ _in_ girl scouts [and] [that] _got_ [you] _involved_ _real good_ [and] [it] [i think it] starts [kids] _out_ _on_ [the] [right] track [and then] [it] lets [them] decide _if_ _that's_ [what] [they] enjoy _doing_ . 
A|12| A: [yeah .] 
B|13| B: [something] 
A|14| A: _i think i_ [i] now [i think] _people_ generally _volunteer_ . 
B|15| B: [yeah .] 
A|16| A: [that] there's _no_ problem [with] _getting_ _them [to_ do] [stuff] . 
B|17| B: [i] [do] _too [._ [i think] i think _a lot of] people_ [a lot] more [people] [volunteer] than than [uh] than _we_ than _get_ credit _for_ [it] [as] [you know] [like] _in_ hospitals _and _uh_ _and_ the_ shelters [and] _stuff like that . and_ _even_ _if_ [it] [is a] couple times [a year] [like] _at_ [the] holidays _i mean_ _at least_ _they're_ [getting] _out_ [and] _doing_ [it] _and you know_ helping helping _out_ [. i think] _that's_ _good_ [and] 
A|18| A: _well_ _we have a_ funny commercial around here . [it] says _something like_ [if] [people] _were_ [to] give five hours [a] week _or_ five percent [of] _their_ salary [we] _could_ [they] _could_ solve _all the_ world's problems _or_ [something] . [so] [i guess if] [we] _all_ give five hours [a] week _or_ five percent [of] _our_ salary [we] _could_ [uh] 
B|19| B: _yeah [yeah_ .] 
A|20| A: _or_ [just] _or_ [just] gave _or_ _or_ _or_ [just] [forced] _our_ [kids] [just [to] to] force [kids] [to] serve [for] [uh] parents [i guess] . 
B|21| B: [yeah] _there_ [you] _go_ . 
A|22| A: substitute . _my_ _my_ [yeah] 
B|23| B: _right ._ 
A|24| A: _my_ kid will [do] four _or_ five hours _this_ week [for] me . _no_ problem . 
B|25| B: [yeah] [it] sounds pretty _good_ [that] sounds _good ._ _i've_ noticed [a lot of] [uh] _different organizations_ _in our_ _community_ [uh] pick _up_ [like] _on_ [the] highway [and] [stuff] _and [i_ think] _that's_ pretty neat . [they uh] _go_ along [and] [have] [so] many miles [i guess] [of] highway [to] _take_ _over_ 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _and they_ _clean_ [it] _up_ . 
A|28| A: _i've seen_ [that _.] yeah ._ 
B|29| B: [and] keep [it] _clean_ [. i think] _that's_ [i] pretty _good_ idea _. _and_ _i_ think you know_ _again_ [i've seen] [a lot of] [young] [kids] _doing that_ _and [i_ think it] gets [them] prepared [to to] learn _how_ [to] [volunteer] [as] [they] _get_ _older_ [. _i] know _i_ _did_ you know_ _in_ girl scouts [and] _everything_ [and] after _that in_ high _school_ [i] [would] [volunteer] _at_ [a] nursing home [and] _stuff like that_ 
A|30| A: [they] [they] [just] started trying [to get them] [something] together [like] [like that] around here from [for] from _the community because_ _uh we_ had [a] big ice storm [uh] very very recently . 
B|31| B: [so] _oh_ . 
A|32| A: [you] [don't] sound [like] _you're_ _in the_ north . [you] sound [like] _you're_ _in the_ south somewhere . 
B|33| B: [yeah] _i'm in_ texas . _where_ _are_ [you] _at_ ?

A|36| A: upstate [new york] [yeah .] 
B|37| B: _oh_ gosh . 
A|38| A: [and uh] 
B|39| B: [yeah .] 
A|40| A: long _way_ [uh] 
B|41| B: [yeah] 
A|42| A: _and _we_ just_ had [a] _really_ big ice storm [. and] basically half [the] trees [in] [in our] [city] [i'm in] rochester which [is] [uh] [right] upstate . half _of the_ trees _in [the_ city] [uh] [are] _no_ [good] anymore . 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] _oh_ [no] . 
A|44| A: [that's] [how] bad [it] _was_ . [everything] [is] [just] down everywhere . 
B|45| B: _oh_ . 
A|46| A: _you know we_ had three hundred thousand [people] without power . 
B|47| B: golly . 
A|48| A: [you know] [it] _was_ [and you know] _and [and_ they] _and we_ didn't [have] power _for a_ week [and] [there] [are] _still_ [people] _who_ [don't] [have] power . 
B|49| B: [are] [you] serious ? 
A|50| A: _oh yeah_ [it's] _been_ [it's] _been_ [it's] _been_ ten days already [and] [there] [are] _still_ _something like_ ten thousand [people] without power . 
B|51| B: [oh] [my] god [how] [do] [they] live ? 
A|52| A: [and] _were_ officially _yeah and_ _we're_ officially [in] [a] state [of] emergency . funny [thing] [is] [the] news [the] national news _how they_ covered _it ._ [uh] 
B|53| B: [yeah . i] haven't heard [a] [thing] . 
A|54| A: [yeah [. [i] think] it] made about three minutes [on] _one_ _of the_ national news stations _or_ [something] _and and_ we've _been_ [in] [a] state [of] emergency [for] [over] [you know] [for] ten _or_ eleven days . 
B|55| B: lord . 
A|56| A: [you know] . _we just_ [got] [our] phone back today [uh _and] and_ [they're] [you know] putting [out] ads now _for people_ [to] come [volunteer] _or_ [to] [have] _their_ [organizations] come [volunteer] _to help_ [clean] [up] [the] streets . 
B|57| B: [well] [that's] _good ._ _that's great ._ 
A|58| A: _because _we_ have_ [you know] everywhere [that] [a] tree [is] down [people] _need_ _help_ [and] _we're_ _all_ _all_ [a lot of] [older] folks _need_ _help_ [getting] _their_ yards cleaned [out] _because_ [they] _can't_ _afford to_ pay anyone 
B|59| B: _right [._ yeah .] 
A|60| A: [and they] _and [and_ they] certainly _can't_ carry [it] themselves 
B|61| B: _right ._ 
A|62| A: [and] [so] 
B|63| B: [and we] _go_ along _and i'm_ [really] _not_ sure [how] [we] find [the] individuals _but_ [we] find [older] [people] [that] cannot [afford to] fix [up] [their] homes [that] desperately [need] [it] [and [uh] we] _go_ along [with] [all the] material [and] [in] [one] day more [or] less _go_ [in] [and] [say] roof paint fix _whatever_ [we] _can_ . 
A|64| A: [oh] [that's great .] 
B|65| B: [yeah and] [spend a] day _doing_ [that's] [really] neat _. i mean_ [it's] _not_ [a lot] [because] [you're] [just] _doing_ [a] _house_ _at_ [a] _time but_ [you know] every [little] [bit] helps . 
A|66| A: [and] [is] [that] supported by [all] donations [to] [the] church [and] [so] forth [or] 
B|67| B: _uh [yeah_ .] [they uh] luckily [we have _a] a_ man [who] owns [a] building company . 
A|68| A: [oh] _so he_ 
B|69| B: [so he] donates [a lot] _not_ [everything] _but_ [a lot [of] the] material . [then] [what] [he] _doesn't_ donate [we just] _go_ [out] [and] buy . 
A|70| A: [that's] [real] nice . 
B|71| B: [yeah [.] and] [it's] _not_ [you know we] [don't] promote [it] [a lot] outside [the community [because] we] [don't] want recognition [for] _it _you know_ so_ _much_ [as] [we just] want [to help] [people] [out] . 
A|72| A: [right .] 
B|73| B: [so] [it's] [real] neat . 
A|74| A: [that] [that's] [real [good] .] 
B|75| B: [it's] [yeah] 
A|76| A: [and i] [and i] bet [it] gives [you] [a] [real good] _feeling_ [to] [be] [doing [that] .] 
B|77| B: [it's] [like] [i] [say] [it's] _not_ [a lot] _but_ [it] helps [people] . [like] [this] last couple [we] helped [you know] [they] [were] [in] [their] eighties _and she_ [was] bedridden [and i] [just] [you know] [just] tears your heart [out] [to to] _see_ [this] kind [of] [thing] 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [and you know] [if] [you] _can_ [do] any [a little] [bit] [it] helps [so] 
A|80| A: _that's that's_ [uh] [that's] [real [good] .] 
B|81| B: [yeah .] 
A|82| A: [we] had [uh we] had [organizations] [like [that] in] college [you know] . [we] had [a] [community] service group [in] college [that] had [all] sorts [of] [different] groups [and] [some] [did] [like _that] some_ [did] elderly visits 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [some] [did] [uh] [some] [did you know] big brother big sister [stuff like that . [and] i'm] convinced [that] [that] [that] [at least] twenty-five percent [of] [our] [school] participated [in] [some] sort [of] [a] [some] sort [of] group . [you know] [activity] [like that .] 
B|85| B: gosh . [that's great .] [that's] [a lot] . 
A|86| A: [you know] . twenty-five [i don't] [know] . twenty-five percent ? [a] asks someone [else] _in the_ [yeah] [my] wife [was] big [in] [that] 
B|87| B: [that's that's] [a lot of kids] though . 
A|88| A: [and she] thinks [yeah] twenty-five percent . [it] [it] [was] [a] small [school] 
B|89| B: [oh] [well] [still] [that's] [a] [you know] [that's] [a] [good] chunk [of kids] . 
A|90| A: _but [uh_ yeah] [but [i] mean] [a [a] [a] lot of people] [would] [get] [involved] [and you know] [because] [there] [were] [all] [different organizations] [to do] . [there] [was] big brother big sister 
B|91| B: [yeah .] 
A|92| A: [they] had [a] yearly auction [they] had [a] dance marathon [for] charity [or] [to to] support [that] group . 
B|93| B: [yeah .] [that's] neat . 
A|94| A: such [that] [you know] lots [of people] [got] [involved] [that] _way_ . 
B|95| B: [that's great .] 
A|96| A: [yeah .] 
B|97| B: [that's great .] [but uh] [like] _i'll_ agree [with] [you] though [i don't] [think] [they should have [to] do a year] 
A|98| A: [yeah] [no] neither [do] [i] [. [i think] it] [should be] completely optional [and you know] . 
B|99| B: [yeah . [i] don't] [think [that] _some] people_ [i don't] [think] [have] _uh [a_ year] [in] [them to] [volunteer] [if] [you know] [what] [i mean] . _they're not worth_ [it] 
A|100| A: [yeah] [they're not worth] [a year] . [or] [some people] [just] [just] _can't_ [even] [afford] [it you know] [whatever] [. i mean] _the peace corps_ [doesn't] pay very [well] . [you know] ? 
B|101| B: [right .] [oh yeah] [that's] true [that's] true . 
A|102| A: [people] [get] shipped off [and then] [you know] [and then] [and then] [their] parents [i] [have a] [uh [a] a] friend whose whose son [is] _in the peace corps_ [in] guatemala [or] daughter [is] _in the peace corps_ [in] guatemala [right] now . 
B|103| B: [oh] .

A|106| A: [you know so] 
B|107| B: [i] couldn't either . 
A|108| A: [so] [i think you know] _and _and_ [and_ the] kid's certainly [not] making [much] money . 
B|109| B: [right] [right .] 
A|110| A: [so] [i] [can] [see] [where] [that] [that] may [be] [a] problem . 
B|111| B: [yeah . i] [just] [know] [one] person [that's] [in the peace corps] [and [i] mean] she's [a] teacher [and and] [just] wanted [to do] [it .] she'd [been] [a] teacher [for a] while . [just] decided [she] wanted [to do] [it] [so] [. i mean] [i'm] grateful [for people] [like that] [but [i] don't] [see] [how they] [can] [just] [yeah] 
A|112| A: [just] [take] off [a year] . 
B|113| B: [just] pick [up] [and] head [on] [out] . 
A|114| A: [yeah] [i don't] 
B|115| B: [i] wish [i could] [do] [something [like] that] [but i] [can't] [so] 
A|116| A: [yeah yeah] [well] neither [can] [i] [so] [i] [i] [i] [i] [i] [i did] [my] service before [and] [i'll] [do] [my] [little] [community] service throughout [but] never never [for [a] year] [again] . 
B|117| B: [right] [that's] [the] [way] [i] am [. [i] know] [the] [feeling] . 
A|118| A: [so] [so] [i guess] [our] vote [is] [no] 
B|119| B: [that's] [right] [we're] against [it] [that's] [right .] 
A|120| A: [well] [it's] [been] nice talking [to] [you] [again] . 
B|121| B: _you too_ [and i] hope [everything] works [out] [up] [there] . 
A|122| A: [well] [yeah] [we're] [we're] slowly [getting] [everything] back together [again] . [you know] [it] [it's] taking [time but] [everything] [you know]
