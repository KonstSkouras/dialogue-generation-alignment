A|4| A: _yeah ._ 
B|5| B: _well_ _they did_ _have a_ fairly decent _year_ finally _this year ._ 
A|6| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: _at_ least _they're_ coming _around_ . 
A|8| A: _yeah_ [they're] _going to_ _get_ _better_ _. _i_ mean you know_ . 
B|9| B: _well [i_ mean you know] _i think_ _uh_ _once_ jimmy johnson _gets his_ system established _uh_ _they'll_ [do] _all right_ . 
A|10| A: _yeah ._ _as_ _long_ _as_ troy aikman doesn't _get_ hurt _again ._ _that_ _kind of_ _killed_ them _at the end of the season_ _last year ._ 
B|11| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [so] _i don't_ _i don't_ _even_ _know who_ [your] [favorite team] _is_ _actually_ . 
B|13| B: _i'm_ _a_ viking _fan ._ 
A|14| A: okay _. i think i_ [did] [know] _that_ _i just_ forgot . okay . 
B|15| B: _and _they_ haven't _been_ doing_ _too_ hot [so] . 
A|16| A: _yeah ._ has herschel walker _done_ _much_ _for_ them ? 
B|17| B: _no_ _in fact_ _in fact_ _the cowboys_ _got_ [the] best [end of] [that] deal . 
A|18| A: definitely . [well] _he _was_ a_ good player _. _i_ guess_ [well _i] don't know_ _he_ _just_ _never_ _i don't know_ _for a_ while _there_ 
B|19| B: _i've_ [never] _been_ over _impressed with him_ . 
A|20| A: [well] _he_ could _always_ _get_ past [you know] he'd _get_ past _like_ _six_ _or_ seven tackles [and] _just_ _keep_ spinning [around] [and] _get_ _on_ _into _the_ end_ zone . _but_ _um _i_ guess you_ [never] could _really_ _see_ [him] play because [with] [the cowboys] while _he was_ [with] [the] [team] [the] rest _of the_ [team] _was_ pretty poor [so] [you] couldn't _really_ tell if _it was_ _just_ [him] _or_ [the] [team] [and] [i] _always_ _just_ assumed [that] _he was_ [too] good _for_ [the] rest _of the_ [team] . _but _i_ don't know_ . 
B|21| B: [well] who's [the] running _is it_ sammy _smith_ [or] _is it_ _emmett smith_ . 
A|22| A: [emmett smith] _yeah ._ 
B|23| B: [emmett smith] . 
A|24| A: he's [been doing] real good . [i'm] pretty [impressed with him] [so] far . 
B|25| B: [yeah .] 
A|26| A: [did] _he_ [did] _he_ _actually_ play [in] [the] pro bowl _. i_ _remember_ _he was_ _like_ [a] backup _and then_ somebody [got] injured _and he was_ supposed _to_ go . 
B|27| B: _i'm not sure_ . 
A|28| A: _yeah i_ _kind of_ [i] [haven't been] keeping _up_ [with] _football_ [i mean] [in] [the] fall [i] [i] _can_ go _on_ [and] _on_ _about_ _football_ _but_ _since_ it's _kind of_ off _season_ it's _kind of_ hard _to_ [think] back _about_ [all] [that] . _but uh_ 
B|29| B: [who] _else_ [is] _uh oh_ there's [you know] mike minnesota _vikings_ _used _to_ be the_ general manager starting [the] world [football] league . 
A|30| A: [yeah .] 
B|31| B: [so] _and [and_ he was] _trying to keep_ [uh] _uh _i_ can't_ [even] [think] [of the] guy's name either [the] coach [of _the] vikings_ . 
A|32| A: _um i_ [have] [no] idea . 
B|33| B: jerry burns . 
A|34| A: [no] earthly idea . 
B|35| B: [he was] [going _to] keep him_ [as] [the] coach somehow [but _uh] [i_ don't know] _i'd_ [like] _to see_ _the vikings_ [get] revamped somehow . 
A|36| A: how [did] [they] [end] _up_ [this year] ? [did] [they did] [they] _make_ [it] [to] _the play-offs_ [at] [all] ? 
B|37| B: [well] _they started_ _out_ [really] _bad_ [they] _went_ [like] _one_ [and] [six] _and then they_ won _five_ [or] [six] _in a_ row . 
A|38| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [so] _they were _in_ _a_ shot_ [to] [make] [the play-offs] _and they_ screwed [up] _the last_ couple [of] _games_ . 
A|40| A: _kind of like [the_ cowboys] [huh .] 
B|41| B: [yeah [i] guess you] [can] 
A|42| A: except [i think] [the cowboys] _are_ _on the_ upswing [i don't know] _about_ [the vikings] 
B|43| B: [yeah .] 
A|44| A: _just_ hadn't heard _much_ _about_ them lately . 
B|45| B: [and] _the cardinals_ _were_ [kind of like the] _in fact_ _they were_ [doing] [better] _than [the_ _cowboys] and_ [the] _cowboy_ [cowboys] came [on] strong [at the end of the season] [and] _the cardinals_ [got] [killed] by [the cowboys] [so] . 
A|46| A: [yeah .] _well [the_ cardinals] [i don't know] _. i think_ [the cowboys] probably [have a] [a] [better] [team] . [they] _just_ [at the end of the season] [the] [kind of] [got] messed [up] [with] aikman getting hurt because [uh] laufenberg _just_ couldn't _ever_ [really] [get] [it] together [at] [all] . _of course_ [he] sat along [the] sidelines [all] [season] [he] [never] [really] [got] [in a] game [never] [did] [a] whole lot . 
B|47| B: _oh_ [don't] made _any_ excuses [for] [him] 
A|48| A: [well] [i'm] _just_ saying [i] shouldn't [i] shouldn't blast [him] [like] [that] _say_ [oh] [well] laufenberg [got] [out] _there_ [and] blew [it] [for] them [i mean] [he] didn't [get] [to see] _much_ action . [but] [too] [bad] . because _now_ _now_ [you know] [he] had [a shot] [and and] didn't look [too] good [and] [so] [no] one's [going to] [have] _much_ faith [in] [him] [any] _more_ . 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [in fact] [i think] [they're] getting [a] different guy _for a_ backup quarterback _. i_ [haven't] [uh i] [haven't] kept [up] [with] [it] lately _but i_ _remember_ reading _something_ [a] few months _ago_ _about_ them signing somebody [else] [on] [or] [or] [trying to] go after somebody [or] trade [for] somebody [but] [it] wasn't anybody [i'd] [really] heard [of] . _but i_ heard _on the_ radio [this] morning [or] _yesterday_ morning [that] [uh] aikman's back [in] practicing [doing] real real [well] . _um_ [who] [is it] michael irvin 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [he] said [that] [uh] aikman [was] hitting [him] [right] _on the_ numbers every _time_ . [so] sounds [like] he's [going [to] be] [all right] [for] next [season] . [they're] _just_ [trying] [not] [to] overwork [him] [right] _now_ until [he] [gets his] shoulder [uh] back [in] _it was_ [his] shoulder wasn't [it] [that] [he] had [the] problems [with] ? 
B|53| B: [i don't know] [yeah _i] think it was_ . 
A|54| A: [i think _it] [i_ think it was] [his] shoulder [he] had surgery [on] . [but] _anyway_ [they're] [trying [to keep] him] [you know] [keep him] [uh] from reinjuring anything [but] _anyway_ 
B|55| B: [but uh] [well i] [got] _my_ _thirty day notice_ [yesterday] . 
A|56| A: [thirty day notice] [for] _what_ ? 
B|57| B: [um] [i'm] [done] _where_ [i] work . 
A|58| A: [oh] [really] . 
B|59| B: [so] [anyway] _i guess we_ _can't_ _talk_ [much] [more] _about that_ [but [i] just] thought [i'd] throw [that] _in there_ 
A|60| A: _what_ . [oh] okay maybe i'll call [you] back after after [the] recording [is] finished . _actually_ [i think] [we] [have] _talked_ [about] [football] [for] [five] minutes _. [i_ can't] _remember_ . 
B|61| B: [oh] _i've always_ ran _out of_ [time] [ever] [since] _i've done_ [this] . 
A|62| A: [really] _. i_ usually [have] _too ._ 
B|63| B: [they] [always] [say] you've [talked] [your] _ten_ minute limit . 
A|64| A: [yeah] [i've done] [that] [once] [or] twice _. i_ didn't look [at the] clock _when_ [we] [started] talking [so] [i guess we] should [talk] [about] [football] _a little bit_ longer [just] [to be] _sure we_ [got] [five] minutes [in] . 
B|65| B: [make] [sure we] [get] our cash flow . 
A|66| A: [yeah .] [so] other [than [the] vikings] [who] [do] [you] [like] ? 
B|67| B: [um] [actually] [when] [i] [was] younger [i] [was a] cardinal _fan_ [too .] 
A|68| A: [uh oh] . 
B|69| B: [remember] jim hart ? jim hart [was] playing . terry metcalf [was] [on [the] cardinals] . [this] [was a] [long] [time] [ago] . 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| B: [um [i] don't [know] who] [else] [i've] [ever] . that's [about] [it i] [was] [always] [a] viking _fan [._ i think i] [was] [into [the] cardinals] [for [a] little bit] [and] 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] back [when] [they were in] saint louis ? 
B|73| B: yes [oh] [of course] . 
A|74| A: [since] they've [been] [to] phoenix [they haven't been] [uh] [all] [that] impressive [i guess] [. [i] guess] [i've always] [been] [a] [cowboy] [fan .] other [than] [that] [i mean you know] [when] [i've] [you know] [when] [you] grow [up] [in a] city [that] has [the] [you know] [one] [of the] greatest [football] teams until [the last] few years [you] [kind of] tend [to] [get] caught [up] [in] [it] . 
B|75| B: [yeah] [well _the] cowboys were_ america's [football] [team] 
A|76| A: [yeah .] 
B|77| B: there's [no] question _about that_ [so] . 
A|78| A: [yeah [i] mean] [it] [it was] [really] exciting growing [up] [when] [when] [the cowboys were] [really] big . because [my] parents would [always] [have] [season] _tickets_ [and] they'd go [to] [all] [the] [games] [and] [you know] [the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . it's [just] [you know] [the last] [oh] [i guess] probably [since] [about] eighty-four [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they started] [kind of] [going] downhill [really] [but] [you know] [i'm] [just] [used to] [always] growing [up] [and] hearing [cowboys] [cowboys] [cowboys and] [you know] super bowl [and] [all] [this] other stuff . [so] [i can't] [you know] [i'm not] [going to] decide [i don't] [like] them [just] because [they're] having [a] few [bad] years [. [i] mean] [i think] [they'll] pull [out of] [it] [and] [you know] [they'll] [they'll] wind [up] being good _again ._ they've [got] some lot [of] [really] good young players [that] _are_ [going to] [that] _are_ [going to] [uh] [do] pretty good [i think] . [but] [they're] raising prices [on] their _tickets_ . [so] [they're] banking [on] [doing] good next [season] [. i think] _tickets_ _are_ 
B|79| B: [again .] 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: [what] [are] [they] _going up_ [to] [thirty] bucks [or] [something] ? 
A|82| A: [thirty] [or] thirty-two [for] [really] good _tickets_ . [see] [they] [they] sectioned [it] [out] [even] [more] . [they] [used to] [just] [have] [like] [uh] first [of] [all] [it was] [all] [one] price . [and then they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] [end] zone [and then] everything [else] . [and] _now_ [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] from [one] twenty yard line [to] [the] other [one] [just] [on the] _lower_ levels [is] [the] highest price [and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] same area [but] above [it] [on the] upper level [and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] [ten] yard line . [and then] [they're] some sections [kind of] [in] [the] corner areas [and then] [the] cheapest [of course] [is] [going [to] be [the] end] [the] direct [end] zones . [but] [um] [they] [have] [about] four [or] [five] different prices _now_ [that] [they're] structuring [it] [with] [but] obviously [yeah] [they're] [all] [going up] [more] [or] less [is] [what] it's [going to] [do] . 
B|83| B: [so] [now] [the] [tickets] [even] [got] [lower] [than the] lowest [one] [last year .] 
A|84| A: [um] [you know] [i'm not sure] [i'm not] positive [i] didn't [i] didn't [really] [think] [about that] [. [i] just] [remember] [trying to] figure [out] [where] [you] could [get] [that] [was] real close [to] [the] good section [but] [in] [the] [little bit] cheaper . [but] [not] [that] i'll [ever] go [. i] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [cowboys] game [time] [last] [time] [i] [went] [to] [the cowboys] game [was] during [that] [um] n f l strike [or] [the] [when] [they] had [the] scab [team] teams [in there] [and] [it was] [the] [uh] [dallas] [and] washington redskins game . [and] [i] [went] because [my] dad [can] usually [get] [a] hold [of] some free [tickets] because [a] lot [of] those doctors [have] [season] [tickets] [and they] [um] if [they're] [not] [going to] use them [they'll] give them [to] somebody [else] . [so] [my] dad [i] [went] [with] [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one] [time] . [but] [that] wasn't [a] real [you know] [it was] [it was] [the] scab teams [it was] [kind of] [you know] [it was] [kind of] different [i guess] . [and] before [that] it's [been] quite [a] few years . [i've] [been] wanting [to] go [to] [a] game [i just] [never] [never] [have] gotten [around] [to] [it] . [so] maybe [this year .] 
B|85| B: that's interesting [i] almost lost our electricity here . 
A|86| A: [oh] .
