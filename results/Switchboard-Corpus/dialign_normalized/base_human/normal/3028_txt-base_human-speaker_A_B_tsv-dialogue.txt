B|5| B: [right] 
A|6| A: _so_ _what_ _are_ your thoughts _on_ dining _out_ ?

B|9| B: _well_ _a_ little bit [for the price] 
A|10| A: okay .

A|12| A: [uh-huh .] [the _really] ?_ okay .

A|14| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: _some_ _of the_ _some_ _of _the_ best_ _food_ [i] _have_ ever _had_ _was_ [out] [of] _a_ outside _or_ inside [of] _a_ place [that] [we] drove up _and i_ _was_ _like_ _i'm_ [not] eating _in_ _there [are_ you] nuts ? _and uh_ [we] _went_ _in_ _and it was_ [the] _it was_ [the] most wonderful _food_ .

B|17| B: _yeah ._ 
A|18| A: _oh ._ 
B|19| B: _i'm_ serious .

B|37| B: [that] _should_ _get_ [you] close enough [to] _to be_ able [to] find [it] _. [i_ think] [it's] [uh] _probably_ listed [in the] _restaurants_ [you know] .

A|44| A: [no] [because] _they use_ everything _they_ _can_ [and] make _this_ into pressed whatever _. _they_ use_ [the] _they use_ [the] insides [of the] animals heart [and] liver _and they_ _they_ form _it _and_ they_ make [it] [look like] _roast beef_ [and i] said [no] thank _you ._ 
B|45| B: [oh] _no _no_ no ._ someone has been lying [to [you] .] _what [they_ use] [is] [roast beef] . 
A|46| A: _well [that's_ not] [what] [i] heard _from_ _one of_ _somebody_ [that] [was] supposed [to] [know] [what _they] were_ _talking about ._ 
B|47| B: [that's] [what] [oh] [my] goodness . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: _i'm_ surprised . [my] dad worked [for] [arby's] [for] several years . 
A|50| A: [really ?] 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: unless _somebody_ [is] trying [to] blackball _them ._ 
B|53| B: [well that's] happened before . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: _but_ [we] [like] _good_ [uh] we're [we] [like] mexican [food] . 
A|56| A: okay . 
B|57| B: [and] stuff [like] [that] [. _and] so_ [um] 
A|58| A: _how_ _about_ [the] _health food_ [uh] [restaurants] ? [well] [like] _this_ [one] [but it's] _probably not_ advertised [as] such [is] [it] ? [or] 
B|59| B: [a] [health [food] ?] 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] [health food] [uh] [restaurants] [that] 
B|61| B: [like] [like] name [one] 
A|62| A: [well] [well] [like] [um] [well i] _can't really_ [think] [of] any off [the] top _of my_ head [right] _now_ [because] _there's_ [so] few [and] [far] between . 
B|63| B: _i'm_ [not] _sure_ [what] _you're_ [talking about .] 
A|64| A: [but] [they] ought [there are] [restaurants] [that] cater [to] [the] people [that] [are] very [health] conscious . [you know] [as far as] _their_ cholesterol levels [and] _their_ _their_ fat content [and] _you know the_ amount [of] calcium [and so] forth [that] [are] [in] each product _and they_ list _them ._ _now_ _there's_ [one] [restaurant] [that] does _that and_ [it's] called rodolfo's _over_ _on_ preston road [and] royal lane [i] believe . 
B|65| B: _huh ._ 
A|66| A: _and they_ [have] very [good] [food] _over_ _there ._ 
B|67| B: [i don't] _guess_ _i've_ ever been [to] anything [like] [that] _so i_ [really] [don't] [have] anything [to] compare [it] [to] . 
A|68| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh _.] they_ do list [um] [you know] list [the] fat 
B|69| B: _it would_ _be_ [good] [i think] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [uh] [i don't] [know how] expensive [they] [are] _. it_ sounds [like] [that] _it would_ [probably] 
A|72| A: [well] [it was] pretty reasonable [. i] [it was] _around_ ten _dollars for_ lunch . okay _which is_ kind [of] high [for] lunch _i guess_ . 
B|73| B: [for] [one] person ? 
A|74| A: [yes .] 
B|75| B: [oh] 
A|76| A: [yes] [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [a] bit 
A|78| A: [yeah .] [uh] [but] [um] [you] _were_ served by maitre d's _and [and_ uh] [um] men waiters . 
B|79| B: [yeah] [i] [i] won't [really] _be_ interested [in] [going to] [in] [going] [there .] [because] [i] feel [like] _i'm_ _i'm_ paying [you know] five [dollars [for] the] [food] [probably] [and] five [dollars for] something [that] [i] could _get_ along quite [well] without 
A|80| A: [well] _if_ [you're] looking [for] [a] nice [uh-huh .] [well _i] guess_ _if_ [you] _were_ having _if_ [you] _were_ trying [to] impress _somebody_ [like] _taking_ _somebody_ _that you_ hadn't seen [for] [a] long time [and] wanted [to] show _them_ [a] [good] [restaurant [.] [it's] a] special occasion type thing . 
B|81| B: [yeah .] maybe maybe [that] _. yeah ._ 
A|82| A: [yeah .] 
B|83| B: [yeah [.] i] could [see] [that] then maybe . 
A|84| A: [uh-huh [.] and] _now_ [the] red lobster [i] found [is] very nice [at] lunchtime . 
B|85| B: [yeah] [i] [like] _the the_ seafood [that] [they] when [they] _had_ [it] [you know the] _broiled_ 
A|86| A: [because] _they're_ [well] [they] [have] lunch _specials_ _that you can't_ _you can't_ beat [that] [price] [uh] _if_ [you] [went] _to a_ cafeteria . 
B|87| B: [yeah .] [probably] [that's] true . [but] _i know_ [a] lot [of] [their] [a] lot [of] [their] [specials] sometimes [are] fried things [that you [can't] really] _get_ away _from the_ fried 
A|88| A: [well i] [had the] [i] _had a_ [broiled] _chicken_ breast [and it was] excellent [. [it] was] [a] marinated [broiled] _chicken_ breast [and it was] 
B|89| B: [now] why _would_ [you] go [to a] seafood [restaurant] [to eat] [chicken] ? 
A|90| A: [oh] [it was] 
B|91| B: [that's] [one [of] my] husband's pet peeves . he doesn't understand why [somebody] _would_ go [to a] seafood place [and] [eat] _either_ [chicken] [or] steak [you know] . 
A|92| A: [well] [i've] never [had] _catfish_ [either] [in] [a] [restaurant] _because i'm_ [from the] north [and] [that] [was] [a] [no no .] 
B|93| B: [oh] [really ?] 
A|94| A: [and i] haven't gotten _over_ [that] [from the] north . 
B|95| B: [oh] [catfish] [is] wonderful . 
A|96| A: [i know] [they] say [that] [that] [is] 
B|97| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|98| A: [but] [i'm] [but] they've got [all] _these_ caution signs [now] _on_ fish 
B|99| B: [really] . 
A|100| A: [and [so] i] kind [of] stay 
B|101| B: why ? 
A|102| A: [because] [of] [all] [the] pollution [in the] lakes [and] [the] everywhere [. i mean] [there] isn't any safe haven anymore [for] fish . 
B|103| B: [oh _.] huh ._ 
A|104| A: [and] especially [uh] [in] wisconsin [and] michigan [they] say [no] buying [of] our fish . 
B|105| B: [that's] too bad [because i'm] [probably not] [going to] stop eating [it] 
A|106| A: [i] [well] [yeah _.] [so_ i] am [and] [the [the] best] brand [of] [chicken] [to] buy [is] [the] [uh] pilgrim pride [because] [they] [don't] [use] [all] _these_ hormones [to] remote [uh] unnatural growth [in] [their] products . 
B|107| B: _uh-huh . yeah ._ 
A|108| A: _so i mean_ [we] [have] [to be] _on the_ lookout _if_ [we] want [to] stay healthy . 
B|109| B: [that's] true . 
A|110| A: _so i'm_ [i] [you know] [i] 
B|111| B: [oh] [on] [one] hand [i see] [that and] [on the] other hand [uh] [my] older sister remembers when [uh] [at] [one] point [they were] [taking] radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels [which] [i guess] [had a] half-life [of] [oh] five years [if] [they] sit empty [on] dry _land_ . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh . yeah .] corrode [. huh .] 
B|113| B: [so] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] [which] reduces [it] dramatically . 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: [and] then [they] take [these] things [that] will rust [and they] throw [them] [in the] ocean [which is] [going to] speedup [the] process _even_ more . 
A|116| A: [well] i'd [like] _to get_ ahold [of] [some] engineers [and] knock [their] heads together [if] [it would] do any [good] . 
B|117| B: [oh [.] and] then [they] wouldn't [think] [. [they] were] floating [around] [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them .] 
A|118| A: [oh] dear . 
B|119| B: [and] [this] [is] before [i] [was] born . 
A|120| A: wow . 
B|121| B: [so i mean] we're [taking] thirty years ago [this] happened 
A|122| A: [sure] [. yeah .] 
B|123| B: [and and] who's [you know the] tuna [is] radioactive [to a] certain extent . 
A|124| A: [that's] [right .] everything [we] [eat] . everything everything [we] [eat] [should] [have] [a] label [on] [it] 
B|125| B: [you can't] [get] away [from] [it] [so [i] think] [to] [some] point 
A|126| A: [yeah .] 
B|127| B: [yeah] [you know] [. so] [there's] [you know] [there's] [some] things [i think] [we] [can] [we] [you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] [health] purposes [and] [some] things [that] [we] just need [to] [like] [you know] [this] [is] [not] [in] [my] control . 
A|128| A: [well] [you know] 
B|129| B: [so i'm] [either] [going [to] be] [i'm] [either] [going to] starve [to] death [or] [i'm] [going [to] get] [over] [it and] just go ahead [and] [eat] [as] healthily [as] [i] possibly [can] [you know] . 
A|130| A: [well] becky [you know] [even] [if] [you] lived off your own [land] [that you] [would] [have] [to] put caution signs
