B|5| B: [right] 
A|6| A: _so ,_ _what_ _are_ your thoughts _on_ dining _out_ ?

B|9| B: _well ,_ _a_ little bit [for the _price] ,_ 
A|10| A: okay .

A|14| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: _some_ _of _the_ ,_ _some_ _of _the_ best_ _food_ [i] _have_ ever _had_ _was_ [out] [of] _a_ , outside _or_ inside [of] _a_ place [that] [we] drove up _and i_ _was_ _like ,_ _i'm_ [not] eating _in_ _there [are_ you] nuts ? _and , uh _,_ we_ _went_ _in_ _and it was_ [the] _it was_ [the] most wonderful _food_ .

A|46| A: _well [, that's_ not] [what] [i] heard , _from_ _one [of_ ,] _somebody_ [that] [was] supposed [to] [know] [what _they] were_ _talking about ._ 
B|47| B: [that's] [what] , [oh ,] [my] goodness . 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: _i'm_ surprised . [my] dad worked [for] [arby's] [for] several years . 
A|50| A: [really ?] 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: unless _somebody_ [is] trying [to] blackball _them ._ 
B|53| B: [well , that's] happened before . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: _but_ [we] [like] _good_ [uh ,] we're _, we_ [like] mexican [food] . 
A|56| A: okay . 
B|57| B: [and] stuff [like] [that] [. _and] [so_ _,] um ,_ 
A|58| A: _how_ _about_ [the] _health food_ [, uh ,] [restaurants] ? [well _,] like_ _this_ [one] [but it's] _probably not_ advertised [as] such , [is] [it] ? [or] , 
B|59| B: [a] [health [food] ?] 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] [health food] [, uh ,] [restaurants] _that ,_ 
B|61| B: _like _,_ like ,_ name [one] 
A|62| A: [well] [well [,] like [,] um ,] [well , i] _can't really_ [think] [of] any off [the] top _of my_ head [right] _now_ [because] _there's_ [so] few [and] [far] between . 
B|63| B: _i'm_ [not] _sure_ [what] _you're_ [talking about .] 
A|64| A: [but] [they] ought , [there are] [restaurants] [that] cater [to] [the] people [that] [are] very [health] conscious . _you know ,_ [as far as] _their_ cholesterol levels [and] _their ,_ _their_ fat content [and _,] you know , the_ amount [of] calcium [and so] forth [that] [are] [in] each product _and they_ list _them ._ _now_ _there's_ [one] [restaurant] [that] does _that and_ [it's] called rodolfo's _over_ _on_ preston road [and] royal lane [i] believe . 
B|65| B: _huh ._ 
A|66| A: _and they_ [have] very [good] [food] _over_ _there ._ 
B|67| B: [i don't] _guess_ _i've_ ever been [to] anything [like] [that] [so [,] i] [really] [don't] [have] anything [to] compare [it] [to] . 
A|68| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh _.] they_ do list [, um _,] you know ,_ list [the] fat , 
B|69| B: _it would_ _be_ [good] [i think ,] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [uh [,] [i] don't] [know how] expensive [they] [are] _. it_ sounds [like] [that] _it would_ [probably] , 
A|72| A: [well [,] it was] pretty reasonable [. [i] [,] it was] _around_ ten _dollars for_ lunch . okay , _which is_ kind [of] high [for] lunch _i guess_ . 
B|73| B: [for] [one] person ? 
A|74| A: [yes .] 
B|75| B: [oh] 
A|76| A: [yes] , [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [a] bit 
A|78| A: [yeah .] [uh ,] [but [,] um [,] you] _were_ served by maitre d's _and , [and_ , uh [,] um ,] men waiters . 
B|79| B: [yeah] _, i [,_ i] won't [really] _be_ interested [in] [going to _,] in_ [going] [there .] [because] [, i] feel [like] _i'm ,_ _i'm_ paying [, you know ,] five [dollars [for] the] [food] [probably] [and] five [dollars for] something [that] [i] could _get_ along quite [well] without 
A|80| A: [well ,] _if_ [you're] looking [for] [a] nice , [uh-huh .] [well , _i] guess_ _if_ [you] _were_ having , _if_ [you] _were_ trying [to] impress _somebody_ [like] _taking_ _somebody_ _that you_ hadn't seen [for] [a] long time [and] wanted [to] show _them_ [a] [good] [restaurant [.] [it's] a] special occasion , type thing . 
B|81| B: [yeah .] maybe , maybe [that] _. yeah ._ 
A|82| A: [yeah .] 
B|83| B: [yeah [.] i] could [see] [that ,] then maybe . 
A|84| A: [uh-huh [.] and] _now_ [the] red lobster [i] found [is] very nice [at] lunchtime . 
B|85| B: [yeah] [, i] [like] _the , the_ seafood [that] [they ,] when [they] _had_ [it [,] you know , the] _broiled_ , 
A|86| A: [because] _they're_ , [well ,] [they] [have] lunch _specials_ _that you can't_ [, _you] can't_ beat [that] [price [,] uh ,] _if_ [you] [went] _to a_ cafeteria . 
B|87| B: [yeah .] [probably] [that's] true . [but] _i know_ [a] lot [of] [their ,] [a] lot [of] [their] [specials] sometimes [are] fried things _, [that you_ [can't] really] _get_ away _from the_ fried , 
A|88| A: [well , i] [had [the] [,] i] _had a_ [broiled] _chicken_ breast [and it was] excellent [. [it] was] [a] marinated , [broiled] _chicken_ breast [and it was] 
B|89| B: [now] why _would_ [you] go [to a] seafood [restaurant] [to] [eat] [chicken] ? 
A|90| A: [oh [,] it was] , 
B|91| B: [that's] [one [of] my] husband's pet peeves . he doesn't understand why [somebody] _would_ go [to a] seafood place [and] [eat] _either_ [chicken] [or] steak [, you know] . 
A|92| A: [well ,] [i've] never [had] _catfish_ [either] [in] [a] [restaurant] _because i'm_ [from the] north [and] [that] [was] [a] [no] [no .] 
B|93| B: [oh ,] [really ?] 
A|94| A: [and i] haven't gotten _over_ [that] [from the] north . 
B|95| B: [oh ,] [catfish] [is] wonderful . 
A|96| A: [i know] [they] say [that [,] that] [is] , 
B|97| B: [oh ,] [really] . 
A|98| A: [but] [i'm ,] [but] they've got [all] _these_ caution signs [now] _on_ fish 
B|99| B: [really] . 
A|100| A: [and _so] i_ kind [of] stay 
B|101| B: why ? 
A|102| A: [because] [of] [all] [the] pollution [in the] lakes [and] [the ,] everywhere [. i mean] [there] isn't any safe haven anymore [for] fish . 
B|103| B: [oh _.] huh ._ 
A|104| A: [and] especially [, uh [,] in] wisconsin [and] michigan [they] say [, no ,] buying [of] our fish . 
B|105| B: [that's] too bad [, [because] i'm] [probably not] [going to] stop eating [it] 
A|106| A: [i ,] [well ,] [yeah _.] _so_ i_ am [, and] [the , [the] best] brand [of] [chicken] [to] buy [is] [the [,] uh ,] pilgrim pride [because] [they] [don't] [use] [all] _these_ hormones [to] remote [, uh ,] unnatural growth [in] [their] products . 
B|107| B: _uh-huh . yeah ._ 
A|108| A: _so [i_ mean [,] we] [have] [to be] _on the_ lookout _if_ [we] want [to] stay healthy . 
B|109| B: [that's] true . 
A|110| A: _so [i'm_ [,] i [,] you know [,] i ,] 
B|111| B: [oh ,] [on] [one] hand [i see] [that and] [on the] other hand [, uh ,] [my] older sister remembers when [, uh ,] [at] [one] point [they were] [taking] radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels [which] [i guess] , [had a] half-life [of ,] [oh ,] five years [if] [they] sit empty [on] dry _land_ . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh . yeah .] corrode [. huh .] 
B|113| B: [so] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] [which] reduces [it] dramatically . 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: [and] then [they] take [these] things [that] will rust [and they] throw [them] [in the] ocean [which is] [going to] speedup [the] process _even_ more . 
A|116| A: [well ,] i'd [like] _to get_ ahold [of] [some] engineers [and] knock [their] heads together [if] [it would] do any [good] . 
B|117| B: [oh [.] and] then [they] wouldn't [think] [. [they] were] floating [around] [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them .] 
A|118| A: [oh ,] dear . 
B|119| B: [and] [this] [is] before [i] [was] born . 
A|120| A: wow . 
B|121| B: [so [,] [i] mean] we're [taking] thirty years ago , [this] happened , 
A|122| A: [sure] [. yeah .] 
B|123| B: [and , and] who's [, you know , the] tuna [is] radioactive [to a] certain extent . 
A|124| A: [that's] [right .] everything [we] [eat] . everything , everything [we] [eat] [should] [have] [a] label [on] [it] 
B|125| B: [you can't] [get] away [from] [it] [so [i] think ,] [to] [some] point , 
A|126| A: [yeah .] 
B|127| B: [yeah] [, you know] [. so] [there's] [, you know ,] [there's] [some] things [i think] [we] [can] [we] [, you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] [health] purposes [and] [some] things [that] [we] just need [to] [like [,] you know ,] [this] [is] [not] [in] [my] control . 
A|128| A: [well [,] you know ,] 
B|129| B: [so i'm] [either] [going [to] be] , [i'm] [either] [going to] starve [to] death [or] [i'm] [going [to] get] [over] [it] [and] just go ahead [and] [eat] [as] healthily [as] [i] possibly [can] [, you know] . 
A|130| A: [well ,] becky [, you know ,] [even] [if] [you] lived off your own [land] [, that you] [would] [have] [to] put caution signs ,
