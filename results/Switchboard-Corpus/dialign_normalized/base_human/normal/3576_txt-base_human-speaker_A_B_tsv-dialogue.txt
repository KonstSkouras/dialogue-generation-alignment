B|40| B: um . 
A|41| A: [and i] [uh] [i think] _what_ [we're] _what_ [we're] trying [to do] [is] create sort [of] [a] wind break [because] [i] tell [you] [in the] winter time when [that] when [that] wind comes [out] [of the] north [it] [just] cuts _right_ through [you] _like_ you're not even [there] .
