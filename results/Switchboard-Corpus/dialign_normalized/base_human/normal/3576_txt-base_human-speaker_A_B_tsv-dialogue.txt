B|40| B: um . 
A|41| A: [and [i] [,] uh [,] i think] _what_ [we're] , _what_ [we're] trying [to do] [is] create sort [of] [a] wind break [because] [i] tell [you] [, in the] winter time when [that] , when [that] wind comes [out] [of the] north , [it] [just] cuts _right_ through [you] _like_ you're not even [there] .

B|48| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|49| A: [and we] [get] hummingbirds come [in the] spring [, you know ,] [all] summer long . 
B|50| B: [oh] . [oh [,] that] sounds [so] pretty . 
A|51| A: [and ,] [well ,] when [we] leave [the] doors open _, they_ _fly_ [in the] house . 
B|52| B: [oh] [really] [do] [they] , [don't do] [any] damage [, though [,] they] [just] [fly] [right] back [out] , if [you] [have] [the ,] 
A|53| A: [well ,] yeah [, they] [don't] _like_ [it] [in] here [because] _there's nothing_ [to] eat 
B|54| B: [i] see . 
A|55| A: [and] when you're [as] busy [as] [one of] those babies , you've got [to] eat most [of the] time .

A|67| A: [well ,] [these] [are] _accidental_ [tomatos .] 
B|68| B: [what] does [that] [mean ,] [accidental] [tomatoes] ? 
A|69| A: [well ,] last year [the] birds came [and] ate [a] few [of the] [tomatoes] , [of] course you're going [to] lose [some] [that] [way] 
B|70| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|71| A: [and the] seeds go [right] through [them .]
