A|9| A: _i mean_ _she_ actually asks _to_ _go_ _out_ . 
B|10| B: _that's_ _great_ . 
A|11| A: _and , _uh ,_ yeah_ _i was_ amazed . _really_ _good_ temperament _and_ very playful _and_ affectionate , _good_ personality _. _i_ don't _know_ _,_ _i_ can't_ imagine [what] _, uh ,_ would _have_ _been_ wrong with _this dog , _so_ ._

A|17| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|18| B: _and i_ _just _,_ you_ _get_ [so] _attached _to_ them_ . 
A|19| A: _oh _, yeah_ _._ _i_ had a_ _, uh ,_ last year _i had_ _i had_ another _german shepherd_ , [now] _this one_ _was_ purebred _and , uh ,_ _he_ , _when_ _he_ _was_ [about] seven _months_ old [got] [a] gastrointestinal virus [and] _was just_ [about] _on_ death's door [but] _, uh ,_ managed _to get_ him [to] [a] veterinarian _in_ _time_ , 
B|20| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|21| A: _and , uh , and_ _on_ huge doses [of] antibiotics _, _and_ he_ actually [got] _over_ _it_ with , seven hundred dollars _in_ _vet_ bills , 
B|22| B: _um_ . wow . 
A|23| A: [um] [, but] _he_ [had] actually _was_ able _to get_ him _over_ _that ._ 
B|24| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|25| A: _and then_ _he_ _was_ gaining weight _again ,_ _was just_ _getting_ healthy _, and , uh ,_ _he_ put _on_ [about] fifteen [to] twenty pounds after _the_ thing _and then_ _he_ [got] hit by [a] cadillac . 
B|26| B: [oh] _no ._ 
A|27| A: [so] [, _i] couldn't_ _believe_ _it ._ _that was , that was_ _really_ hard . 
B|28| B: [oh ,] gee . 
A|29| A: [and] _that was_ _even_ harder [for] [, _i] was_ _on a_ business trip _at_ _the_ _time_ [and] _the_ [dog] _was_ being house sit , or [dog] sit , whatever , by some friends _of mine_ _down_ _the_ [street] , 
B|30| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|31| A: [so] they [just] felt _absolutely_ awful . 
B|32| B: [oh [,] i] bet . 
A|33| A: [and i] felt , felt probably _worse_ [for] [them] _than_ , _than_ [for] _me_ because _, _oh_ gosh_ they _, _the_ _,_ uh ,_ _this_ fellow's wife _who_ _was _,_ uh ,_ _watching_ _the_ [dog _,] she [,_ i] think [she] loved [that] [dog] more _than_ [i] _did_ _and , [uh_ .] _she was_ _really_ [attached to] _it ,_ 
B|34| B: [oh gosh] . 
A|35| A: [but] _, uh _,_ it's_ unfortunate [, but] _now ,_ _i've_ [got] another _one_ _, _so_ ._ 
B|36| B: _yeah , yeah ._ _how_ long _has_ [it] [been] since [the] _first_ [one] ?

B|40| B: _yeah . well_ _i had [,_ [i] had a] [german shepherd] _before_ [this one] [and] [when] [she] _died_ [it] _just [,_ it] [just] [absolutely] destroyed [me] _. i mean_ [i [was] _just] _,_ you know ,_ 
A|41| A: [yeah .] 
B|42| B: [i couldn't] [even] talk [about] [it] [for] [months] _and so i_ decided [well] _that's_ [it _,] i'm_ _not_ _going _to_ do_ [this] anymore 
A|43| A: _right ._ 
B|44| B: [and then] god gave [me] [this dog , so] 
A|45| A: [my] dad's _like_ [that] , _he_ _, uh ,_ _he_ [had a] beagle [that] _he_ loved _and , uh ,_ [when] [that] beagle passed away _, uh ,_ _he_ _didn't want_ , _he_ wasn't [going to] [have] another [dog _,] there's_ [no] way , 
B|46| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: [no] [how] _, [and_ then] _, uh _,_ _the_ ,_ _he_ [the] beagle [died] _in_ [i] guess [about] october [and] by christmas _time_ _we_ went _down_ [to] [the] pound [and] [got] him _, uh [,_ i] or [, i] humane society [and] [got] _, uh ,_ [got] another [one] _, a_ stray .

B|54| B: _yeah , well_ _when _,_ uh , my_ _, my_ doggie [, uh [,] that] [we] [have] [now [,] uh [,] [she's] [,] [she's] mostly] _golden retriever_ .

A|67| A: [that's] [not] [too] bad . golly [the] [golden] retrievers [are] _good_ dogs [too _,] they're_ [kind of] [like _,] get_ [that] permanent smile [to _them] ,_ 
B|68| B: [yeah _,] [right_ .]

A|75| A: [this] , [this friend of mine] [has] [, well] [it's] [the same] guy _that _was_ watching_ [, uh , my] [german shepherd] [when] _he_ [got] hit [, but] [, uh ,] went fishing with him [on] friday [and] took , _he's_ [got] [a] full [, a] pure bred [golden retriever] [and then] [i [had ,] uh _,] the_ [puppy] [, _a] little_ tiny [puppy] [and] [we] went [and] took [the] two dogs [up] fishing [. and] [this] , they [just ,] they [had a] ball romping around , 
B|76| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|77| A: [and [,] you know [,] [you] can't] [get] [a [golden] retriever] near water without [it] jumping [in] . 
B|78| B: [getting] _in [,_ yeah .] 
A|79| A: [and , uh ,] [this] [golden retriever] jumped _in _the_ , _the_ _,_ really_ fast moving [, uh ,] river current [, and , [uh] .] 
B|80| B: [oh _,] no ._ 
A|81| A: [well] [no] , actually _he_ [had] [no] trouble _at all ._ _he_ [first] jumped [in] [and [i] ,] _he's_ , _he's_ [just] [about] [a] year old himself [and] never [had] _really [,_ _i] don't_ think he'd swum [before] . 
B|82| B: [really .] 
A|83| A: [but] _he_ jumped [in ,] _in _the_ , the_ river . 
B|84| B: [did] [puppy] [go] [to] ? 
A|85| A: _well the_ [puppy] jumped _in _the_ ,_ into some _of the_ pools [but] [not] into _the [,_ [i] was] careful [to] keep [her] away from _the , the_ fast moving water , 
B|86| B: [oh ,] [that's] [good] [, yeah .] 
A|87| A: 'cause if [she] fell [in] [then] i'd [of] [been] , [had] [to] [go] [in] after [her] [. and] [up] here [the] water's probably [about] forty degrees [right] [now] . 
B|88| B: ugh , ugh . 
A|89| A: [and i] would [not] [have] [been] fun _trying to_ retrieve [her [,] but] [, uh ,] [this dog ,] dennis jumped [in] [and] [got] [this] look [on] his face [like] [what] [do] [i] [do] [now ,] as _he's_ floating _down_ [the] river [then] finally discovered [that] _he_ could swim [and , uh ,] actually paddled [up] against [the] current [and , uh ,] made [it] back [to] [the] shore [and] climbed _up [and_ then] , _he_ , _he_ jumped [in] _again , _and_ he_ [was] _swimming_ [for] quite [a] bit , [all] afternoon . _he_ loved _it ._ 
B|90| B: [yeah ,] 
A|91| A: cocoa _didn't_ think [too] much [of] [it ,] though . [she] jumped [in] [and then] started screaming [and] made [me] pull [her] back _out_ [. i] pulled [her] _out_ [and , uh ,] [then] [had] [to] wrap [her] [up] [in] [a] sweatshirt because _she was_ shivering [so] bad , 
B|92| B: [yeah .] 
A|93| A: [and so] [, but] _, uh , she_ [got] [over] [it [,] [so] .]

A|95| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|96| B: [and [, [uh ,] she] was [,] she] [did] [not] [want] any part [of] [swimming] [but] [she] liked [to] , [to get] [in the] pool [on] [the] [first] step . she'd [just] [get] [on] [the] [first] step [and] lay [down] . [you know] [in the] summertime [when] [it's] [really [,] really] hot . 
A|97| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
B|98| B: [and] she'd [just] lay _there_ [on] [that] step [and] [just [,] you know ,] cool off

A|111| A: [oh ,] [okay [,] my] [my] [dog ,] last [german shepherd] [, it was] [a] real chore [trying to] give him [a] bath [too] [. and] _that was the_ thing [i couldn't] figure _out_ because _he_ would [go] [in the] lake [, it] wasn't [like] _he_ [didn't] 
B|112| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|113| A: normally [, [i] mean] _he_ [didn't] seem [to] [have a] problem with [getting] _wet_ [, but] if [you] _wanted to get_ him _wet_ , forget [it .] 
B|114| B: _yeah , well_ _that's how_ cleo [, you know ,] she'd lay [on] [her] step , 
A|115| A: [yeah .]
