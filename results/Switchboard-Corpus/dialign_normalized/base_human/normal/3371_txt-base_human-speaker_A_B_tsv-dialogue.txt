A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ _well_ , _our_ home _is_ [, uh [,] probably] [, for] _our_ _area_ [it's] [probably] [one _of] the_ lower income [homes] _out_ [here .] [uh ,] _most of _the_ , the_ [homes] [that] they're building , _well_ _, i_ shouldn't say _all_ [of] them [, but] _most of_ them [now] _are_ _up [in_ the] millions [of] dollars . 
B|3| B: _really_ ? 
A|4| A: [oh] _yeah ,_ there's , 
B|5| B: how many square feet [do _you] have_ ?

A|22| A: [of] course , [i'm] _not a_ carpenter _or anything like that_ . _they could_ [probably] come [in] [and] say , gee , _this_ [is] [not] straight [and] _this_ [is] _under_ something [but ,]

A|36| A: _yeah [,_ _i] [,_ i've heard] _a lot of_ _people_ say [that] . _that's_ [for] [sure] . [uh _,] we have_ an _attic_ [that] _we've_ [just] put [, you know ,] plywood over [the] beams [and] _things_ _up _in_ the attic_ [and] [so that ,] _has_ replaced [it] [to] _some_ extent 
B|37| B: [so] [you] , 
A|38| A: [but] certainly [not ,] 
B|39| B: can [you] stand [up in] [it] ?

B|41| B: [so] _you _have_ a_ [probably] [a] more pitched roof than [is] typical around [here .] 
A|42| A: yes . 
B|43| B: ours [is] pitched [so] shallow [that] [you] [, uh ,] don't get much [room] [in the attic] . 
A|44| A: [yeah .] _yeah _,_ _we_ , uh ,_ _we've_ got [, you know ,] i'll store [all] [our] christmas stuff [and] whatever else junk [up] _there_ . 
B|45| B: [so ,] [five bedrooms] [and] [two living] , [two] _family_ 
A|46| A: [two living] areas . _we [have_ a] [living room and] dining [room] _at_ [the] front _of _the_ house_ , 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [and then] _we [have_ [a] _,] the [,_ uh ,] [family] [room] , kitchen [, and] playroom _at_ [the] rear _of _the_ house_ _which has_ _been_ [really] nice . 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [in] fact [, i] [really] enjoy [the] playroom [that [,] [you] would] think [that] [would] [not] be [a] real bonus [, you know ,] [to] [a] [house] [, but] [of] [all] [the] _rooms_ _in the house_ i'd say [that] [was] , [that] [was] [the] [one] _that's_ _been_ [really] nice [to] [have] 
B|51| B: isn't [it] funny how families end [up] [living] [in] [one] [room] [in the house] [most of the] time . 
A|52| A: [i] think _that's_ true . 
B|53| B: [you] 
A|54| A: [yeah .] [probably] [our] [family] [room] [is] _the , the_ biggest . [uh ,] 
B|55| B: right . [some] [people] [, [i] mean] , families seem [to] migrate towards [one] , [one] [room and] carry _on_ [most of] their activities [there] [, and , uh [,] uh ,] [some] [rooms] [, we have] [one] [room] [that] [we] never [use] . 
A|56| A: [yeah .] 
B|57| B: [i mean] might as [well] [not] even heat [and] cool [it .] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: strange . 
A|60| A: [well] , _that's_ kind [of the] _way_ [our living room and] dining [room] [is] , 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: _but it is_ nice [to] [have] [it] _because_ there's [, uh ,] _with_ [our] size [of] [family] [it's] nice [to] [know] [that] there's [one] _that's_ always straight [and] clean _if_ [you have] someone come [just] _on the_ spur [of the] moment . 
B|63| B: right , right . [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [so] 
B|65| B: [so] you've [been] fairly [happy with it .] how long [have] [you] [been] [in] [it] ? 
A|66| A: seventeen _years_ . 
B|67| B: _wow ._ boy _, it_ doesn't seem [that] long [but it is] [because [we] , uh ,] came [to] [this] [area] [about] [the] same time 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [we've been] fifteen , fifteen [years] [in [the] [,] [in] the house] [that] we're [living] [in] . 
A|70| A: [oh ,] [wow .] 
B|71| B: [and] [we [,] [the ,] the] principal feature [i] [like] [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
A|72| A: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: yours [is] [a] slab [i] assume . 
A|74| A: yes [, [it] is] . 
B|75| B: [yeah ,] ours [is] [a] pier [and] beam [which has] allowed me [to] go [under] [it] [and] [do] [a] whole [lot of] different [things] [that] [i] [could] [not] [have] done [if] [it] [was] slab . 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [i've] done [a lot of] electrical [and] plumbing [and] other work [that ,] by myself [and] saved [a lot of] money [that] [i] [couldn't] [have] done [if] [the house] [was] [on] [a] slab . 
A|78| A: [well] , _that's_ interesting . 
B|79| B: [but] [that's] [because] [it's] [so] old . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: [it's] thirty-five , thirty-six [years] old _when_ [they] used [to] build [like [that] [,] and , uh ,] 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] [well] , _my_ husband wouldn't [do] [that] anyway . [that's] his , [that's] his , 
B|83| B: [i] [know ,] he's [not a] handy , right ? 
A|84| A: worst thing [in] life [is] [to] [have] [to] repair something . 
B|85| B: [i ,] [on the] other hand [, uh ,] [do] [a lot] too much [of] [it] 
A|86| A: [so ,] 
B|87| B: [and , uh [,] i've] gotten good [at] [it] [which] [in] [a [,] in] [a] [way] [is] bad [because] [then] [you] [, uh [,] you] start [to] take pleasure [in] [it] 
A|88| A: [well] [, uh ,] [that's] great . [we] [just] kind [of] save everything [for] [when] al [, uh , for] [, for] [when] his _dad_ comes [to] visit [and then] he does [all] [the] repairing [, you know ,] he does 
B|89| B: right . [my] [dad] [is] actually [, uh ,]
