B|1| B: _i'm_ [in] [a] _uh in_ [a] ranch . [a] _uh_ _it_ _was_ _about uh_ sixteen _hundred_ square feet _when_ _i_ bought _it_ _and uh_ _it's_ _about_ _two_ thousand square feet _now_ _but_ _it's_ _one of_ those typical _uh_ ranches _that you_ find around _here ._ _oh_ _it's_ _uh_ _built_ _in the_ _probably_ _built_ _in the_ late fifties [so] _it's_ _not_ _um_ [what] _you would_ find _uh_ where [you live] . _but_ _uh for_ _the_ older _uh_ ranch _homes_ _it's_ pretty typical _i_ guess . 
A|2| A: _uh-huh ._ _well_ _our_ home _is_ [uh] [probably] [for] _our_ _area_ [it's] [probably] [one _of] the_ lower income [homes] _out_ [here .] [uh] _most of _the_ the_ [homes] [that] they're building _well_ [i] shouldn't say _all_ [of] them [but] _most of_ them [now] _are_ _up [in_ the] millions [of] dollars . 
B|3| B: _really_ ? 
A|4| A: [oh] _yeah_ there's 
B|5| B: how many square feet [do _you] have_ ? 
A|6| A: _we have_ got [about uh] twenty i'd say [about] twenty-four [hundred] .

A|12| A: [oh] . 
B|13| B: _when_ _when_ [we] added four [hundred] square feet _to_ [our] [house] 
A|14| A: [oh] _that's_ great . 
B|15| B: _so that_ 
A|16| A: _well_ _this_ _this_ [house] _is_ very comfortable . _we've_ got _two living_ areas [and] [that] _that's_ [the] thing [i] [probably] _like_ [the] _most_ [about] _it ._ 
B|17| B: how many stories ? _just one_ ?

A|20| A: [um] _we've been_ real _happy with it ._ 
B|21| B: [yeah .] _i've heard_ [that] _i've heard_ [the] construction [is] pretty good _on_ [fox and jacobs] . 
A|22| A: [of] course [i'm] _not a_ carpenter _or anything like that_ . _they could_ [probably] come [in] [and] say gee _this_ [is] [not] straight [and] _this_ [is] _under_ something [but] 
B|23| B: [but] _i mean_ [it] doesn't give [you] trouble ? 
A|24| A: _no_ . 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: _no_ [we] haven't had _a lot of_ problems _with it_ _at_ _all_ .

A|32| A: [yeah .] 
B|33| B: _you know_ [what] [i] miss though ? basements . 
A|34| A: [oh] [yeah .] 
B|35| B: [i] [i] _sure_ wish [they could] build basements [in] [homes] [in] texas . 
A|36| A: [yeah] [i] [i've heard] _a lot of_ _people_ say [that] . _that's_ [for] [sure] . [uh] _we have_ an _attic_ [that] _we've_ [just] put [you know] plywood over [the] beams [and] _things_ _up _in_ the attic_ [and] [so that] _has_ replaced [it] [to] _some_ extent 
B|37| B: [so] [you] 
A|38| A: [but] certainly [not] 
B|39| B: can [you] stand [up in] [it] ? 
A|40| A: [uh in] parts . [i mean] [you] _couldn't_ [you] [really] _couldn't_ _use_ [it] [for] [a] [room] . 
B|41| B: [so] _you _have_ a_ [probably] [a] more pitched roof than [is] typical around [here .] 
A|42| A: yes . 
B|43| B: ours [is] pitched [so] shallow _that you_ [uh] don't get much [room] [in the attic] . 
A|44| A: [yeah .] [yeah] _we uh_ _we've_ got [you know] i'll store [all] [our] christmas stuff [and] whatever else junk [up] _there_ . 
B|45| B: [so] [five bedrooms] [and] [two living] [two] _family_ 
A|46| A: [two living] areas . _we [have_ a] [living room and] dining [room] _at_ [the] front _of _the_ house_ 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [and then] _we [have_ a] [the] [uh] [family] [room] kitchen [and] playroom _at_ [the] rear _of _the_ house_ _which has_ _been_ [really] nice . 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [in] fact [i] [really] enjoy [the] playroom [that [you] would] think [that] [would] [not] be [a] real bonus [you know] [to] [a] [house] [but] [of] [all] [the] _rooms_ _in the house_ i'd say [that] [was] [that] [was] [the] [one] _that's_ _been_ [really] nice [to] [have] 
B|51| B: isn't [it] funny how families end [up] [living] [in] [one] [room] [in the house] [most of the] time . 
A|52| A: [i] think _that's_ true . 
B|53| B: [you] 
A|54| A: [yeah .] [probably] [our] [family] [room] [is] _the the_ biggest . [uh] 
B|55| B: right . [some] [people] [i mean] families seem [to] migrate towards [one] [one] [room and] carry _on_ [most of] their activities [there] [and uh] [uh] [some] [rooms] [we have] [one] [room] [that] [we] never [use] . 
A|56| A: [yeah .] 
B|57| B: [i mean] might as [well] [not] even heat [and] cool [it .] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: strange . 
A|60| A: [well] _that's_ kind [of the] _way_ [our living room and] dining [room] [is] 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: _but it is_ nice [to] [have] [it] _because_ there's [uh] _with_ [our] size [of] [family] [it's] nice [to] [know] [that] there's [one] _that's_ always straight [and] clean _if_ [you have] someone come [just] _on the_ spur [of the] moment . 
B|63| B: right right . [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [so] 
B|65| B: [so] you've [been] fairly [happy with it .] how long [have] [you] [been] [in] [it] ? 
A|66| A: seventeen _years_ . 
B|67| B: _wow ._ boy [it] doesn't seem [that] long [but it is] [because [we] uh] came [to] [this] [area] [about] [the] same time 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [we've been] fifteen fifteen [years] [in the] [in the house] [that] we're [living] [in] . 
A|70| A: [oh] [wow .] 
B|71| B: [and] [we] [the the] principal feature [i] [like] [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
A|72| A: [oh] [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: yours [is] [a] slab [i] assume . 
A|74| A: yes [it is] . 
B|75| B: [yeah] ours [is] [a] pier [and] beam [which has] allowed me [to] go [under] [it] [and] [do] [a] whole [lot of] different [things] [that] [i] [could] [not] [have] done [if] [it] [was] slab . 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [i've] done [a lot of] electrical [and] plumbing [and] other work [that] by myself [and] saved [a lot of] money [that] [i] [couldn't] [have] done [if] [the house] [was] [on] [a] slab . 
A|78| A: [well] _that's_ interesting . 
B|79| B: [but] [that's] [because] [it's] [so] old . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: [it's] thirty-five thirty-six [years] old _when_ [they] used [to] build [like that] [and uh] 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] [well] _my_ husband wouldn't [do] [that] anyway . [that's] his [that's] his 
B|83| B: [i] [know] he's [not a] handy right ? 
A|84| A: worst thing [in] life [is] [to] [have] [to] repair something . 
B|85| B: [i] [on the] other hand [uh] [do] [a lot] too much [of] [it] 
A|86| A: [so] 
B|87| B: [and uh] [i've] gotten good [at] [it] [which] [in] [a] [in] [a] [way] [is] bad [because] [then] [you] [uh] [you] start [to] take pleasure [in] [it] 
A|88| A: [well] [uh] [that's] great . [we] [just] kind [of] save everything [for] [when] al [uh for] [for] [when] his _dad_ comes [to] visit [and then] he does [all] [the] repairing [you know] he does 
B|89| B: right . [my] [dad] [is] actually [uh]
