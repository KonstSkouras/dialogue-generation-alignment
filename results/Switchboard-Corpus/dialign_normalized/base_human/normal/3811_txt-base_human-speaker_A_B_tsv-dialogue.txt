A|0| A: _so_ _you _have_ a_ _child_ _uh-huh ._ 
B|1| B: _yeah_ _we_ two _year_ old daughter _in child care_ _and we_ went through _the_ process _of_ searching _for child care_ _and_ _uh_ finding _what_ _we_ consider _to be_ real _good_ _child care at_ [a] _uh_ _pretty_ reasonable price _we_ think . 
A|2| A: [uh] 
B|3| B: _how_ _about_ [you] _do_ [you have] any children ? 
A|4| A: yes _our_ first [and] he _just_ turned _three_ months . 
B|5| B: oh boy . 
A|6| A: _so_ _we're_ _just_ starting _into_ hunting [for _child care] ._ 
B|7| B: _yeah ._ 
A|8| A: right now _both_ [of] us _are_ students . 
B|9| B: [are] [you] ? _where_ [are] [a] student ? 
A|10| A: _uh _uh_ university_ [of] southern mississippi . 
B|11| B: _no_ kidding . 
A|12| A: [uh] she's 
B|13| B: _i_ was [a] professor _in_ [a] [university] here _in_ california [for] [a] while . 
A|14| A: [yeah .] 
B|15| B: [yeah] [uh] [are] [you] _going _to_ uh_ put your son _in child care_ _in_ _a _a_ year_ or two ? 
A|16| A: [uh] _probably_ _. uh_ actually spring semester [a year] _from_ now he's [going to] _have [to_ be] [in child care] [uh] five days [a] week _more_ _than_ likely _. uh_ depending _on_ [how] _my_ class schedule runs 
B|17| B: [yeah .] 
A|18| A: _because_ _my_ wife _will_ [be] doing _her_ internship _that_ semester . 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: _it will_ [be] _forty_ hour week not [no] eight [to] five type [of] _thing_ . 
B|21| B: [yeah .] 
A|22| A: _so_ depending _on_ [what] _my_ class schedule looks _like_ he may spend four anywhere _from_ four [to] eight hours [a] day [in [child care] at] _that_ point . right now _we're_ trying [to] avoid _it_ _but_ [we] _just_ _as a matter of fact_ _just_ yesterday hired [a a] girl [to uh] watch him _. _uh_ i_ _get_ _out_ [of] class [at] certain time [and] _my_ wife _is_ already supposed [to be] _on_ _her_ _way to_ _her_ class . _you know_ once [a] day _this_ overlap happens [where] [we] can't one [of] us [be] _home ._ 
B|23| B: _yeah . yeah ._ 
A|24| A: _so_ [for] [about] twenty twenty _thirty_ minutes [a] day [we] _got_ [a] baby-sitter _comes in_ . 
B|25| B: well that's [a] _good_ experience [i] think [and] [uh] there [are] _a lot of_ _things_ [to] think [about] [and] _the_ articles [that] [are] written _on the_ topic [are] _pretty good_ [and] _they_ kind [of] boil down [to uh] any other important decision [you] _really_ [have to] explore _the_ alternative 
A|26| A: [uh-huh] 
B|27| B: [and] [what] [we] found [uh] [to be] _the best_ guide was [our] own instincts [about] _people_ who _were_ [going [to] be] loving 
A|28| A: [yeah .] 
B|29| B: [and] [uh] that's [more] important [than] anything else . [we] could [have] sent [uh] [her] [to] [a] fancier [uh] facility . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [uh] she goes [to] [a] [home .] [this] [is] [a] [uh] [a] couple [uh] emigrated [from] china early [in] [in] _their_ lives . 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: they've been here [probably] [thirty] [forty] years . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| B: they've [got] [three] daughters [. uh] [and] _they have a_ loving [home] [and] [uh] they're [both] there [and] _they have a_ kid [that] [comes in] [and] helps them [in] _the_ afternoon . 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [and] [our] daughter [is] healthy happy well adjusted [and] enjoys [going to] see [her] friends 
A|38| A: [yeah .] 
B|39| B: [so] _it's_ [a] _good_ experience . 
A|40| A: [uh] [that] makes [a] big difference . 
B|41| B: [i] _if_ _it's_ _good_ [i] think _it's_ very _good_ [for] _the child_ . 
A|42| A: yes . 
B|43| B: [and] _if_ _it's_ [a] loving environment [i] think _it's_ very _good_ [and] [and] that's _really_ [what] we've learned [about] [it] . she'll [have to] go [on] [to] something [more] stimulating [in] terms [of] preschool [in] [a year] 
A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: _but uh_ [we] feel real fortunate _and we were_ able [to uh] [just] [uh] choose [in] _the_ marketplace . [i] don't [know] [what] _it's_ [like] around [uh] hattiesburg . 
A|46| A: there's [a lot of] [child care] available [but] invariably there's _waiting_ lists .

B|49| B: [yeah .] i'll bet they're involved _. yeah ._

B|51| B: [yeah] 
A|52| A: [so] 
B|53| B: well that's [uh i] [know] _it's_ _it's_ [a] real hard [thing] _to do_ even [for] [people] [in] [in] [uh university] communities . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [out] here [at] manford [they have a] [you know] [a [a] a] real [good] facility [and] there [uh] [is] quite [a] [waiting list] [to] [get] [into] [that] . 
A|56| A: [yeah .] 
B|57| B: [so] _it's_ [uh uh] [you know] _it's_ [a] _it's_ [a] _it's_ an important decision _it's_ an industry that's still _a cottage_ industry 
A|58| A: [yeah . yeah] 
B|59| B: [and] [i] think [this] [is] _really_ [is] buyer beware . well [it] [is] _the best way to do it_ interestingly . 
A|60| A: [a cottage] industry's [the best way to do it] [really] _because_ [if] [you] over
