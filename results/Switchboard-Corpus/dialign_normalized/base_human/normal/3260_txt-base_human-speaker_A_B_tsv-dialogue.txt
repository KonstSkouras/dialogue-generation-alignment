B|65| B: [yes .] 
A|66| A: [he's] gone three weeks _right_ [now] [and] [that's] , [that's] mild compare [to] [the] [big] ones , 
B|67| B: [yeah .] 
A|68| A: [so] [we] [just] [, you know] [. i] [just] [do] [the] [carpooling [and ,] and] handle [whatever] needs [to be] done [. and] something major , always needs [to be] done . 
B|69| B: [yeah . yeah .]
