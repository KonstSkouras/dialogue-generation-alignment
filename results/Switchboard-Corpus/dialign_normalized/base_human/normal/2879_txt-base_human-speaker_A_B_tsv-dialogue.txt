A|8| A: _uh-huh ._ yes . 
B|9| B: _but _the_ state_ legislatures _are_ _more_ [and] _more_ coming [to] supporting _it_ . 
A|10| A: [yeah _, i _,] uh ,_ i_ ethically _don't_ _like_ [the] idea [but ,] _or_ [i] should say morally _i don't_ _like_ [the] idea , [but , uh ,] social [and] ethics , socially [and] ethically _i think_ _it's a_ good idea _, in_ certain crimes . 
B|11| B: i'd [, i] _would_ agree , _with_ _that_ _even_ _more _,_ i don't know if_ _this is_ _cold_ [and] _too_ pragmatically [but] _i'm_ _really_ offended , _by_ [the] thought _that_ _i have_ [to] support _, uh , just_ [the] existence _of _, you know_ ,_ murder _, rapist_ _, you know _,_ right _,_ _that_ , uh ,_ after _they've_ _gone_ [and] _done_ horrible _things_ , molested _children _,_ and_ _kill_ , _them_ whatever _, _that_ ,_ society _has_ [to] pay [, uh ,] upwards [, uh ,] thirty thousand dollars [a] _year_ [to] incarcerate _them_ . 
A|12| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh _._ [right_ ,] _any_ _, _on_ the_ street , _no_ [, _i] know_ _. uh-huh ._ [yeah [,] and] texas [is] having [a] problem [right] _now_ [and] _it's _,_ the _, the _,_ the _,_ the ,_ the_ _i think_ _that's_ _the , the_ repeat crimes [and the] repeat offenders [is] happening down _here_ where [they're , they're] patrol [, [the] state] patrol board [is] letting people walk [that] [have] [done] _, oh ,_ heinous [things] _from_ _from_ killing _police_ officers _to [,_ i] mean [just] multiple [, you know ,] molestations [to] murders [of] [children _,] just [,_ you know ,] [really] _bad_ [things] [and] [they're] _get ,_ these people [are] getting out _like_ three [to] five _years_ before [they're] [even] suppose _to be_ considered , 
B|13| B: [right] . 
A|14| A: [and] _now ,_ _they_ can't find [them] [and] [they're] finding bodies [in] [you know [,] i] mean [, you] _think_ why _they_ say _it's_ _because_ you're over crowd _, it's_ over crowded [, and] [you] _think_ how [is ,] [is] everybody [that] stupid _or_ _is the_ world [really] [that] rotten 
B|15| B: [i _,] i don't know ,_ 
A|16| A: _i know_ . 
B|17| B: [it's a] hard question [, you] [look _at] the_ united _states ,_ _we_ _have the_ largest murder _rate_ [of] [any] developed [, uh ,] 
A|18| A: _and then_ , 
B|19| B: [or] [, uh ,] 
A|20| A: [i don't know] how americans [are] _about_ handguns [but , uh ,] yesterday [a] lady _i work_ [with] [just] told _me_ today [that , uh _,] _in_ [the_ state] capitol _here in_ austin , texas , _they_ _had_ been [, uh ,] looking [at] [a] bill [, uh ,] making [it] easier [to] accept [the] bill [to] access , [to] access handguns [and] _they_ passed _it _,_ which_ basically means without _an_ f b [i] check [any] person _here _in_ this state_ over twenty-one can _get_ [a] gun 
B|21| B: [here in] [new york] [it's _a] lot_ harder _than_ [that , uh] 
A|22| A: [is] _it ,_ _that's_ good . 
B|23| B: [it] takes _, uh , it_ takes almost _six months_ [to] [get [,] uh ,] handgun permit _, [in this_ state] . 
A|24| A: say [, that] good _, i think_ _that's_ , _like_ [the state] [of] virginia _, yeah ,_ _that's_ _great ._ 
B|25| B: [now [,] the , the _,] and that's_ [with] _, uh , you_ [have] _to have_ _, uh , oh ,_ [a] [police] investigation [, you] [have] [to ,] [have] references , 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _and [i_ [know] _,] because_ [a] friend [of] mine wanted [to] [get] [one] [and] listed [me] _as a_ reference [uh ,] 
A|28| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|29| B: _and [i_ know] [it _,] there_ [is [,] it's] _very_ easy [to] [get [,] uh _,] uh [, you_ know [,] there's] [no] restrictions , whatsoever [, on] hunting rifles [and] shotguns _and things_ _like [that_ [,] which] _aren't_ _the [, i_ _,] i don't_ consider [to be] [the] kind _of _crime_ [,_ uh ,] weapon [, you know ,] 
A|30| A: _uh-huh _._ [right_ [,] they're] [no] [, the] cattiness behind [, right _,] yeah ,_ 
B|31| B: [uh ,] _so ,_ 
A|32| A: [i] mean [i don't] [like] guns [in] general [but] when _i _think_ _about_ , uh ,_ [this] topic [like] _capital punishment_ [i] [look at] somebody [, i] mean [, i] [just] remember when [i] _was_ [in] college _in a_ dorm [and _i] think_ [if] he'd been around [one] [of] my _family_ members _probably_ [would] [have] killed him [but] [in] florida [, _in] [the_ state] [of] washington when _they_ _had_ [the] ted _bundy_ case 
B|33| B: [right] . 
A|34| A: [and] how _they_ [just] _well [,_ it] hasn't been [just] [but] [it] _was_ _in [the _,_ _i] think_ the_ second [or] third quarter [of] last [year] , nineteen ninety 
B|35| B: [right] . 
A|36| A: [and i] _had_ [, you know [,] i] knew some people [that] said , why [are] [you] glad [, you] [you know ,] [this is] nothing [, [and] i] said [just] _maybe_ [because] [he] _got_ _a lot of_ media hype _and all_ [that] _but _i_ actually_ [, i] mean [in] [there] should [be] [more] _cases_ [like that] where _they_ _flip_ [a] [i] might [be] [too] [cold] [too] , [but] _they_ _flip_ [a] _switch_ , 
B|37| B: [yeah [,] yeah ,] 
A|38| A: [i don't know ,] 
B|39| B: [well [,] [and] the] thing [with] [bundy] [was] though [he] escaped 
A|40| A: [i] mean , 
B|41| B: [and then] 
A|42| A: [so] many times . 
B|43| B: [yeah] 
A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: [and] _did_ [it] again _and , uh ,_ 
A|46| A: [yeah , i] mean [, and that's] [just] _maybe_ [because] _of the_ little [more ,] _they_ said celebrated [that , uh ,] he's [not] [the] only [one] [, you know ,] 
B|47| B: [no] . 
A|48| A: [you] [, you] see somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear _about_ somebody's [crime [,] there] [was] something [on] [, and] [this] gets _back_ [to] _capital punishment ,_ [but the] man _had_ stolen [, uh _,] not_ stolen [but] kidnapped [, uh ,] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere [in] florida [and] _they_ changed _all the_ facts [that] _they_ said [it] [was] true 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [and] _they_ buried her alive 
B|51| B: [oh ,] god . 
A|52| A: [and] peter strauss _had_ played [the] lead role [and the] man [, [and] [,] and] [at the] _end_ [of , you know] how _they_ [have] these mini dramas , [at the] _end_ _they_ said , [this] set person [was] paroled [like] [six months] _ago_ [and] you're thinking [oh ,] [that's] nice . 
B|53| B: [great .] 
A|54| A: [i] mean [, you know ,] [i'm] [not] _sure_ [that] _capital punishment_ serves [as a] deterrence [but] [it] [does] serve [as a] [uh ,] definite [, you know ,] lasting 
B|55| B: surely [, there's] [and] [end] [to [,] _the] situation_ . 
A|56| A: [right [,] in] [that] particular instance [, uh ,] _but [i_ ,] _but i don't_ , _but [i_ know] _it's on_ [a] _and all_ [and] [be] _all_ , 
B|57| B: [right] . 
A|58| A: [that's] [the] problem [i have] [with] [it [,] in] texas _they_ _think_ [it's] _and all_ [and] [be] _all_ , _they_ _think_ [that] [if] _they_ electrocute [or] slip , [or] do something , [or] _gas_ somebody [, uh [,] that] [they're] [not] going [to [have] the] crimes [that] _they_ do [have] [and] [we] _happen to_ _live in_ dallas [which] [is] extremely [crime ,] ridden , 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [and] [we] [just] moved [here] [, uh ,] we've been [here] before , lived [in] minneapolis , saint paul [, uh [,] which] [has] _an_ exceedingly low [crime] [rate] [, [and] then] [we] were transferred _back_ [here] [, and] when you're [gone] _from_ some place [like] [it] for _about_ [six] _years_ [as] [we] were [, you] [really] begin [to] see [, uh , just] how problematic [just] living [is ,] [even] suburban , [no] matter where [you] [are] , 
B|61| B: [right] . 
A|62| A: [and] how , you're [in] , [rome , new york ,] 
B|63| B: [rome , new york [,] it's] _up_ [state] [it] _it's , uh ,_ _near_ _syracuse_ 
A|64| A: [is] [that] [and [,] [and] ,] [is] [that] [like] [near] albany [or] [syracuse] , 
B|65| B: [it's] [about , uh [,] well [,] i [,] [i] actually] [live [in] a] village [of] sylvan beach [, [i] work] [in] [rome [,] uh ,] 
A|66| A: what , what _type_ [of] _area_ [is] [that ,] 
B|67| B: _it's more_ rural , 
A|68| A: [is] [that] [in] term , 
B|69| B: _uh , it_ _use to be_ _use _to be_ a_ [, uh [,] uh ,] [have] [a lot of] heavy industry , 
A|70| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
B|71| B: [but] [it's] kind [of [,] uh _,] [all_ the] industry [has] [gone] south , 
A|72| A: _sure ._ 
B|73| B: _and , uh _,_ now_ [the] air force [is the] largest employer [in the [,] uh ,] [area] _and , uh [,_ uh ,] [so] [it's [,] _not] too bad_ , 
A|74| A: how _would ,_ how [is [the] situation] [in] [there] [in] terms [of _crime] [and_ [,] [and] things] _that _would_ ,_ 
B|75| B: [it [,] you know [,] you] still [have [the] [,] uh ,] [more] drug problems [and] typical [, uh ,] small city [type] problems , 
A|76| A: [not too bad] . [yeah _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|77| B: [but [i don't] know] [that] [there's] [a] real [, uh ,] 
A|78| A: [not] _the harsh_ criminality [, that] [you] find [in] , 
B|79| B: [no] [there] _isn't_ [the harsh] [crime [and] all] . 
A|80| A: [yeah [,] [now] ,] dallas [is] [a] [i'm] [being] [very] sarcastic [, it's] [just] [a] [great] [, uh [,] on] some days _, uh , [it's_ _, uh [,] i_ don't know] [the] good ole boy network [here] [is [,] uh ,] [very] strange , [like] [i] said _they_ believe [that ,] [if] _they_ [kill] somebody [, you know ,] tit for tat [and ,] deed for deed [that [,] that] [does] something [, uh ,] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [but] yet _they_ want spend [the] money [to] build [the] [new] jails [that [,] i] mean , _they_ [really] [are] over , crowded , 
B|83| B: [right] . 
A|84| A: [i] mean , [that's] , [that's] [just] [not] [a] cop out [, uh [,] [and] i] _just [,_ you know ,] [i'm] originally _from pennsylvania_ [which] _i think_ [is] basically [like] [new york] these days , [i'm] [not] _sure_ [if] _they_ [, i don't] _think_ _they_ [have] _capital punishment_ [there] . 
B|85| B: [i think] [, i think] [pennsylvania] may [have] [just] reenacted [it] [because] _i'm from_ [, uh ,] [from pennsylvania] also [, just [,] uh , just] outside , [of] philadelphia , 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah [,] and] [i'm from] pittsburgh [so [,] oh [,] well ,] we'll forgive each other 
B|87| B: [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [uh [,] because] _they_ [use to be] [very] , [very] conservative when [i] [was] growing [up] [i] [and i] can't [, i] haven't lived [there] [in] twenty , _years_ 
B|89| B: [right] . 
A|90| A: [but , uh ,] 
B|91| B: [the] west part [of [the] state] [is] [and then] [the] east part [of [the] state] [has] [got] [all the] bleeding hearts [and [all] the] welfare [cases] [so] . 
A|92| A: [there] [you] go [i don't know] [that's] [a] different subject , altogether 
B|93| B: [right] . 
A|94| A: [but _, uh _,] i_ don't know i think_ everybody [would] feel [it] [is] same way [if] _they_ were touched [by] [crime] . _i think everyone would [,_ you] [and [i] think] [are] honest [and] candid [because] [we] could do [it] [on] [, in this] , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|95| B: [right] . 
A|96| A: [but [i] think] everybody [if] _they_ were touched [by] [it] [would] say , [if] _they_ _had_ [any] sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [, i think] every human [does] [, i think] _they'd_ say [, yeah ,] 
B|97| B: [sure .] 
A|98| A: do [it] [if] somebody [in] my _family_ [or] [if] [it] happened [it] [me] [, you know ,] 
B|99| B: [yeah ,] 
A|100| A: [uh ,] 
B|101| B: [if] your friends [or] [family] [got] [, uh ,] [had] [that] [happen to] [them] [i think everyone would [,] i ,] [they'd] , [probably] pull [the] trigger themselves [or] [flip] [the] [switch] themselves [and] [with] [a] smile [on] _their_ face _, as_ _they did_ [it] . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah , i] [just ,] [don't] [think] [that [, uh ,] you] can rehabilitate [, i] mean [i] [just] [don't] [, uh , oh [,] i] [did] [a] paper _back_ [in] college [a] long time _ago_ for criminal justice class [, [and] i] [just [,] the] subject [, i] remember [we] drew [things] out [of] [a] hat [and] [it] [was] something [, uh , it] [was] basically [the] essence [was] [does] [the] [crime] fit [the] _punishment_ [and] when [you] see how many repeat offenders [there] [are] [, uh ,] check , check fraud [cases] where [they] go [to] jail for five [to] ten _years_ [and , uh ,] rape [, rapist] getting [their] hand [, just] slapped [, you know [,] and] how [it] [is] based _on the_ judge [and] [if] [the] time [of] day [that] [the] court [is] [in] session [, you know [,] all] these [, uh ,] intangible [things] 
B|103| B: [yeah [.] right] . 
A|104| A: [and] you're thinking [, oh [,] you] [would] [not] only [would] [you] [not] want [to be a] victim [you] wouldn't want [to be a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't [know] what you're getting [, uh] 
B|105| B: [right] [. right] . 
A|106| A: [but [,] i don't know ,] methods [of] _capital punishment_ [i have] [no] opinions [on] [that] either [i] [just] 
B|107| B: [well [,] uh [, i] , uh [,] _yeah [,] i don't know_ [i think] the] old [gas] chamber seems [to be] _about the_ most painless [because] [i] guess [it's a] pretty , pretty rough thing [to be] [, uh ,] electrocuted . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] [is] [it [,] uh ,] how [about the] _injection ,_ 
B|109| B: [oh [,] yeah ,] [an] [injection ,] 
A|110| A: [is] [that] suppose [to be] . 
B|111| B: [yeah [,] [that] would] [be] [even] [, [yeah ,] i] _didn't_ [even] , [think about] [that] . 
A|112| A: [yeah .] [i'm] [not] [even] [sure] [, [in] the] split among [the] fifty [states ,] do [you know] [which] way [it] [is the] ratio [, [it's] more] [than] , [aren't] _, uh , [it's_ _more] that don't have [it_ ,] 
B|113| B: [i think] , 
A|114| A: [isn't] [that] correct . 
B|115| B: [yeah [,] there's] [more that don't have _it] but_ amazingly [it's] [like] [, uh ,] massachusetts went [back] [, and] reinstated [capital punishment [,] oh ,] [maybe] [six] [or] seven [years] [ago] , 
A|116| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|117| B: _i don't know if they've_ used [it] since [then] since _they've_ reinstated _it [but_ [, uh ,] [it's] [on] the] books . 
A|118| A: [yeah [, [i don't know] if] they've] , [they did] something [about] [i'm] [not] [sure] [if] texas , minnesota [, i ,] [they] [didn't] , [they] [didn't] , [they] were [well ,] [did] [they] [have [it] ,] [they] were against [it [,] uh ,] texas [, as] [i] said , [has] [it [but] i] haven't been [back] [here] long enough [to ,] [to] realize whether [or] [not] , [if they've] [done] [it] [in the] last ,
