A|12| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh _._ right_ _any_ _on the_ street _no_ _i know_ _. uh-huh ._ [yeah] [and] texas [is] having [a] problem [right] _now_ [and] _it's_ _the _the_ _the_ _the_ _the_ _i_ think_ _that's_ _the the_ repeat crimes [and the] repeat offenders [is] happening down _here_ where [they're they're] patrol [the state] patrol board [is] letting people walk [that] [have] [done] _oh_ heinous [things] _from_ _from_ killing _police_ officers [to] [i] mean [just] multiple [you know] molestations [to] murders [of] [children] [just] [you know] [really] _bad_ [things] [and] [they're] _get_ these people [are] getting out _like_ three [to] five _years_ before [they're] [even] suppose _to be_ considered 
B|13| B: [right] . 
A|14| A: [and] _now_ _they_ can't find [them] [and] [they're] finding bodies [in] [you _know] i_ mean [you] _think_ why _they_ say _it's_ _because_ you're over crowd _it's_ over crowded [and] [you] _think_ how [is] [is] everybody [that] stupid _or_ _is the_ world [really] [that] rotten 
B|15| B: [i] _i don't know_ 
A|16| A: _i know_ . 
B|17| B: [it's a] hard question [you] [look _at] the_ united _states_ _we_ _have the_ largest murder _rate_ [of] [any] developed [uh] 
A|18| A: _and then_ 
B|19| B: [or] [uh] 
A|20| A: [i don't know] how americans [are] _about_ handguns [but uh] yesterday [a] lady _i work_ [with] [just] told _me_ today [that uh] _in [the_ state] capitol _here in_ austin texas _they_ _had_ been [uh] looking [at] [a] bill [uh] making [it] easier [to] accept [the] bill [to] access [to] access handguns [and] _they_ passed [it] _which_ basically means without _an_ f b [i] check [any] person _here _in_ this state_ over twenty-one can _get_ [a] gun 
B|21| B: [here in] [new york] [it's _a] lot_ harder _than_ [that uh] 
A|22| A: [is] [it] _that's_ good . 
B|23| B: [it] takes _uh it_ takes almost _six months_ [to] [get] [uh] handgun permit [in this state] . 
A|24| A: say [that] good _i think_ _that's_ _like_ [the state] [of] virginia [yeah] _that's_ _great ._ 
B|25| B: [now] [the the] _and that's_ [with] _uh you_ [have] _to have_ _uh oh_ [a] [police] investigation [you] [have] _to have_ references 
A|26| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _and [i_ know] [because] [a] friend [of] mine wanted [to] [get] [one] [and] listed [me] _as a_ reference [uh] 
A|28| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|29| B: _and [i_ know] [it] _there_ [is] [it's] _very_ easy [to] [get] [uh] _uh [you_ know] [there's] [no] restrictions whatsoever [on] hunting rifles [and] shotguns _and things_ _like that_ [which] _aren't_ [the i] [i don't] consider [to be] [the] kind _of crime_ [uh] weapon [you know] 
A|30| A: _uh-huh _._ right_ [they're] [no] [the] cattiness behind [right] [yeah] 
B|31| B: [uh] _so_ 
A|32| A: [i] mean [i don't] [like] guns [in] general [but] when _i _think_ _about_ uh_ [this] topic [like] _capital punishment_ [i] [look at] somebody [i] mean [i] [just] remember when [i] _was_ [in] college _in a_ dorm [and _i] think_ [if] he'd been around [one] [of] my _family_ members _probably_ [would] [have] killed him [but] [in] florida _in [the_ state] [of] washington when _they_ _had_ [the] ted _bundy_ case 
B|33| B: [right] . 
A|34| A: [and] how _they_ [just] _well_ [it] hasn't been [just] [but] [it] _was_ _in [the_ _i] think the_ second [or] third quarter [of] last [year] nineteen ninety 
B|35| B: [right] . 
A|36| A: [and i] _had_ [you _know] i_ knew some people [that] said why [are] [you] glad [you] [you know] [this is] nothing [and i] said [just] _maybe_ [because] [he] _got_ _a lot of_ media hype _and all_ [that] _but _i_ actually_ [i] mean [in] [there] should [be] [more] _cases_ [like that] where _they_ _flip_ [a] [i] might [be] [too] [cold] [too] [but] _they_ _flip_ [a] _switch_ 
B|37| B: [yeah] [yeah] 
A|38| A: [i don't know] 
B|39| B: [well] [and the] thing [with] [bundy] [was] though [he] escaped 
A|40| A: [i] mean 
B|41| B: [and then] 
A|42| A: [so] many times . 
B|43| B: [yeah] 
A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: [and] _did_ [it] again _and uh_ 
A|46| A: [yeah i] mean [and that's] [just] _maybe_ [because] _of the_ little [more] _they_ said celebrated [that uh] he's [not] [the] only [one] [you know] 
B|47| B: [no] . 
A|48| A: [you] [you] see somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear _about_ somebody's [crime] [there] [was] something [on] [and] [this] gets _back_ [to] _capital punishment_ [but the] man _had_ stolen [uh] [not] stolen [but] kidnapped [uh] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere [in] florida [and] _they_ changed _all the_ facts [that] _they_ said [it] [was] true 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [and] _they_ buried her alive 
B|51| B: [oh] god . 
A|52| A: [and] peter strauss _had_ played [the] lead role [and the] man [and] [and] [at the] _end_ [of you know] how _they_ [have] these mini dramas [at the] _end_ _they_ said [this] set person [was] paroled [like] [six months] _ago_ [and] you're thinking [oh] [that's] nice . 
B|53| B: [great .] 
A|54| A: [i] mean [you know] [i'm] [not] _sure_ [that] _capital punishment_ serves [as a] deterrence [but] [it] [does] serve [as _a] uh_ definite [you know] lasting 
B|55| B: surely [there's] [and] [end] [to] _the situation_ . 
A|56| A: [right] [in] [that] particular instance [uh] _but i_ _but i don't_ _but [i_ know] _it's on_ [a] _and all_ [and] [be] _all_ 
B|57| B: [right] . 
A|58| A: [that's] [the] problem [i have] [with] [it] [in] texas _they_ _think_ [it's] _and all_ [and] [be] _all_ _they_ _think_ [that] [if] _they_ electrocute [or] slip [or] do something [or] _gas_ somebody [uh] [that] [they're] [not] going [to [have] the] crimes [that] _they_ do [have] [and] [we] _happen to_ _live in_ dallas [which] [is] extremely [crime] ridden 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [and] [we] [just] moved [here] [uh] we've been [here] before lived [in] minneapolis saint paul [uh] [which] [has] _an_ exceedingly low [crime] [rate] [and then] [we] were transferred _back_ [here] [and] when you're [gone] _from_ some place [like] [it] for _about_ [six] _years_ [as] [we] were [you] [really] begin [to] see [uh just] how problematic [just] living [is] [even] suburban [no] matter where [you] [are] 
B|61| B: [right] . 
A|62| A: [and] how you're [in rome new york] 
B|63| B: [rome new york] [it's] _up_ [state] [it] _it's uh_ _near_ _syracuse_ 
A|64| A: [is] [that] [and] [and] [is] [that] [like] [near] albany [or] [syracuse] 
B|65| B: [it's] [about uh] [well] [i] [i actually] [live [in] a] village [of] sylvan beach [i work] [in rome] [uh] 
A|66| A: what what _type_ [of] _area_ [is] [that] 
B|67| B: _it's more_ rural 
A|68| A: [is] [that] [in] term 
B|69| B: _uh it_ _use to be_ _use _to be_ [a_ uh] [uh] [have] [a lot of] heavy industry 
A|70| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
B|71| B: [but] [it's] kind [of] [uh] [all the] industry [has] [gone] south 
A|72| A: _sure ._ 
B|73| B: _and uh_ [now] [the] air force [is the] largest employer [in the] [uh] [area] _and uh_ [uh] [so] [it's] _not too bad_ 
A|74| A: how [would] how [is [the] situation] [in] [there] [in] terms [of _crime] and_ [and things] _that would_ 
B|75| B: [it] [you know] [you] still [have the] [uh] [more] drug problems [and] typical [uh] small city [type] problems 
A|76| A: [not too bad] . [yeah _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|77| B: _but i don't know_ [that] [there's] [a] real [uh] 
A|78| A: [not] _the harsh_ criminality [that] [you] find [in] 
B|79| B: [no] [there] _isn't_ [the harsh] [crime [and] all] . 
A|80| A: [yeah] [now] dallas [is] [a] [i'm] [being] [very] sarcastic [it's] [just] [a] [great] [uh] [on] some days _uh [it's_ _uh] [i_ don't know] [the] good ole boy network [here] [is] [uh] [very] strange [like] [i] said _they_ believe [that] [if] _they_ [kill] somebody [you know] tit for tat [and] deed for deed [that] [that] [does] something [uh] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [but] yet _they_ want spend [the] money [to] build [the] [new] jails [that i] mean _they_ [really] [are] over crowded 
B|83| B: [right] . 
A|84| A: [i] mean [that's] [that's] [just] [not] [a] cop out [uh] [and i] [just] [you know] [i'm] originally _from pennsylvania_ [which] _i think_ [is] basically [like] [new york] these days [i'm] [not] _sure_ [if] _they_ [i don't] _think_ _they_ [have] _capital punishment_ [there] . 
B|85| B: [i think] [i think] [pennsylvania] may [have] [just] reenacted [it] [because] _i'm from_ [uh] [from pennsylvania] also [just] [uh just] outside [of] philadelphia 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah] [and] [i'm from] pittsburgh [so] [oh] [well] we'll forgive each other 
B|87| B: [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [uh] [because] _they_ [use to be] [very] [very] conservative when [i] [was] growing [up] [i] [and i] can't [i] haven't lived [there] [in] twenty _years_ 
B|89| B: [right] . 
A|90| A: [but uh] 
B|91| B: [the] west part [of [the] state] [is] [and then] [the] east part [of [the] state] [has] [got] [all the] bleeding hearts [and [all] the] welfare [cases] [so] . 
A|92| A: [there] [you] go [i don't know] [that's] [a] different subject altogether 
B|93| B: [right] . 
A|94| A: [but _uh] _i_ don't know i think_ everybody [would] feel [it] [is] same way [if] _they_ were touched [by] [crime] . _i think everyone would_ [you] [and [i] think] [are] honest [and] candid [because] [we] could do [it] [on] [in this] vehicle [uh] 
B|95| B: [right] . 
A|96| A: [but [i] think] everybody [if] _they_ were touched [by] [it] [would] say [if] _they_ _had_ [any] sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [i think] every human [does] [i think] _they'd_ say [yeah] 
B|97| B: [sure .] 
A|98| A: do [it] [if] somebody [in] my _family_ [or] [if] [it] happened [it] [me] [you know] 
B|99| B: [yeah] 
A|100| A: [uh] 
B|101| B: [if] your friends [or] [family] [got] [uh] [had] [that] [happen to] [them] [i think everyone would] [i] [they'd] [probably] pull [the] trigger themselves [or] [flip] [the] [switch] themselves [and] [with] [a] smile [on] _their_ face [as] _they did_ [it] . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah i] [just] [don't] [think] [that [uh] you] can rehabilitate [i] mean [i] [just] [don't] [uh oh] [i] [did] [a] paper _back_ [in] college [a] long time _ago_ for criminal justice class [and i] [just the] subject [i] remember [we] drew [things] out [of] [a] hat [and] [it] [was] something [uh it] [was] basically [the] essence [was] [does] [the] [crime] fit [the] _punishment_ [and] when [you] see how many repeat offenders [there] [are] [uh] check check fraud [cases] where [they] go [to] jail for five [to] ten _years_ [and uh] rape [rapist] getting [their] hand [just] slapped [you know] [and] how [it] [is] based _on the_ judge [and] [if] [the] time [of] day [that] [the] court [is] [in] session [you know] [all] these [uh] intangible [things] 
B|103| B: [yeah [.] right] . 
A|104| A: [and] you're thinking [oh] [you] [would] [not] only [would] [you] [not] want [to be a] victim [you] wouldn't want [to be a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't [know] what you're getting [uh] 
B|105| B: [right] [. right] . 
A|106| A: [but i don't know] methods [of] _capital punishment_ [i have] [no] opinions [on] [that] either [i] [just] 
B|107| B: [well] [uh [i] uh] _yeah [i don't know_ [i think] the] old [gas] chamber seems [to be] _about the_ most painless [because] [i] guess [it's a] pretty pretty rough thing [to be] [uh] electrocuted . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] [is] [it] [uh] how [about the] _injection_ 
B|109| B: [oh] [yeah] [an] [injection] 
A|110| A: [is] [that] suppose [to be] . 
B|111| B: [yeah] [that would] [be] [even] [yeah i] _didn't_ [even] [think about] [that] . 
A|112| A: [yeah .] [i'm] [not] [even] [sure] [in the] split among [the] fifty [states] do [you know] [which] way [it] [is the] ratio [it's more] [than] [aren't] _uh [it's_ _more] that don't have it_ 
B|113| B: [i think] 
A|114| A: [isn't] [that] correct . 
B|115| B: [yeah] [there's] [more that don't have _it] but_ amazingly [it's] [like] [uh] massachusetts went [back] [and] reinstated [capital punishment] [oh] [maybe] [six] [or] seven [years] [ago] 
A|116| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|117| B: _i don't know if they've_ used [it] since [then] since _they've_ reinstated _it [but_ [uh] [it's] [on] the] books . 
A|118| A: [yeah [i don't know] if they've] [they did] something [about] [i'm] [not] [sure] [if] texas minnesota [i] [they] [didn't] [they] [didn't] [they] were [well] [did] [they] [have it] [they] were against [it] [uh] texas [as] [i] said [has] [it [but] i] haven't been [back] [here] long enough [to] [to] realize whether [or] [not] [if they've] [done] [it] [in the] last
