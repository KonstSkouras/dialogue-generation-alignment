B|14| B: _yeah_ [it's] [it's] [really] [it's] [and] _i've_ seen [in] [more] [in] durham than [i] [have] [in] raleigh _or _or_ or_ chapel hill . 
A|15| A: [really] ? 
B|16| B: chapel hill [is] _kind of_ [a a] ritzy city _or_ whatever . [i] mean [it's] _kind of_ _i'm [i'm_ sure] [there is] [problems] [with] [it] [but] [it] [has] [a] [pretty] low [crime] rate . compare compared [to] [to] durham [has] _probably_ got [the] worst . _they've_ _had_ [like] forty-eight murders since [the] beginning [of the] year . 
A|17| A: [really] ? 
B|18| B: [and] _over_ _half_ [of] [it] [has] been _drug related ._ 
A|19| A: um . _well_ [here] _uh_ [i'm] _not_ [sure] how _many_ dallas [has] [had] . [i've] _uh_ houston [is] averaging _about_ two _a week or_ three [or] four [i] [i] _don't_ _know_ . [a a] number every _week_ . 
B|20| B: _yeah ._ 
A|21| A: _uh_ dallas [is] having quite [a] few . seems [like] _most_ [of] ours [are] occurring [in] late _at night_ [or or] [like] [i] _say_ [drug related .] _uh i_ guess [the] other _thing_ _was_ [that] [are] causing [a lot [of] the] [crime] now [is the] decrease [in] values . seems _like [a_ [a] lot of] _people_ _don't_ hold human life quite as high as perhaps _they_ used [to] . 
B|22| B: _yeah ._ 
A|23| A: _uh i_ 
B|24| B: _well that_ _and the_ _and _the_ economy is_ [so] _bad_ [and] [and] [so] [many] [people] [have] been laid _off_ [and] stuff . 
A|25| A: [the economy is] lousy 
B|26| B: _they've_ done special stories _on_ [the] news local news [here] . 
A|27| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|28| B: [we] [had] [a lot of] bank robberies [and] different [lot of] break ins [and] stuff . [i] [know] [like [a] week _or] so_ ago [i] live _in a in a town_ house which _is you know_ _it's a_ [pretty] _nice neighborhood_ [and] [this] lady [was] [going] [to] work she came _home_ [and] _everything_ [in] her house [was] total gone light fixtures _everything ._ [and] nobody thought any different [they] just thought she [was] moving . [it] [was] [a] moving man pulled [right] [up] [to] her house broke [in] [and] stole _everything_ she owned 
A|29| A: boy [that] [really] [that] [really] takes someone who [is] bold [to] [do] _that ._ 
B|30| B: [well] _yeah_ [it's] [it's] [it's] [pretty] _bad_ 
A|31| A: [well] now [do you] find [that] security [is] very good _in [in_ a in a town] [home] ? 
B|32| B: [uh i] _would say_ [so] [for] [the] majority [in in] our [in] my [little] section [of _the] neighborhood_ because [there is] always somebody [at] [home]

A|39| A: [yeah .] 
B|40| B: [so] [i] [really] [don't] worry [about] anything . 
A|41| A: [well] [i] think [you] hit [on] [one] point [there [is] you know] each other . 
B|42| B: [yeah .] 
A|43| A: [i'm [i'm] [in] a] [neighborhood] where [we] try [to] keep [up] [with] [everything .] [uh i] am oh [about] three blocks [off] [a] major road [and] [uh] [a] couple [of] blocks [off] [another] road [that] [kind of] runs [i] guess [you] [would say] [the neighborhood] road [it] runs between [the] high school [and the] [the] commercial districts [and] [uh] [i'm] [over] [the] northeast part [of] dallas . [it's [a] in a] [nice neighborhood] . [the] houses [here] [uh] before [the] recession were running two hundred thousand [or [so] and] course everything's down ten [to] twenty percent now . 
B|44| B: [yeah] [see] [that's] [the] same [thing] [here] . 
A|45| A: [but] [we] [have] [uh] [one] [one] [thing] [that] effects us [is] [we] [have] apartments [that] [are] [probably] [about] [a] [half] mile away [and] now [the economy is] [bad] [they] [have] trouble keeping those full [so] [they've] dropped [the] [uh] [they're] [not] nearly as selective as [they] used [to] be . 
B|46| B: [yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and] course [that's] [kind of] [like a] cancer [in] an apartment complex . [you] start letting [that] happen [and] [they] go down [and] then before [you know] [it] [you] [have] drugs [and] [a lot of] other [things] [so] [uh] [i'm sure] [that] aggravates [it] also . 
B|48| B: [yeah .] 
A|49| A: [but] unemployment now [in] dallas [or] [in] texas [is] [up] around six point
