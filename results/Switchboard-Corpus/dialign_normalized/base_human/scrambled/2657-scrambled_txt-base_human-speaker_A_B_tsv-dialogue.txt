B|55| B: _oh yeah ._ 
A|56| A: [so] 
B|57| B: [uh] [there] [was] certainly nothing [like] [a] [a] bathroom [a] shower [or anything] near by [it was] dig [your] own hole [and uh] [and i] _i'm not_ [sure] _i'd_ [do] [that] [that] anymore

B|63| B: huh . 
A|64| A: [oh yeah [.] i] guess [it is] [like] [that] though [because] [it] [seems] [like] _more_ [and] _more_ [people are] [like] _that [._ but] [um i] guess [it's] [because] [i'm] older _i mean_ [i'm not] [real] old [but i] am older [and um] [you know] [i didn't] feel [like] [that [i] didn't] feel [like] [i had] [to] [have] everything [. i] guess [it was] [because] _well [i_ had] everything [when] [i] [was] at _home_ [but [i] [i] don't] [know] why [i didn't] .

A|70| A: [uh-huh .]
