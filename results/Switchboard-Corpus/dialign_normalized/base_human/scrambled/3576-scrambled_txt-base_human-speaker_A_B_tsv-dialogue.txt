A|44| A: hence [the] savings [and] loan problem _we_ [have] . 
B|45| B: least [with] [the] jury [you] [have] twelve [people] [you know] [that] [are] going [to] decide [you know] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .]

A|52| A: oh [i] see . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [but] [i] remember [from] her checking [around] she ended [up] staying [at] [the] arkansas _house_ [i think] _out_ [in] arlington something _like_ [that .] 
A|56| A: [there] [would] [be] kids [there] [that] [were] excellent [at] ripping [you] off 
B|57| B: [so] [you] [have] [kind of] [a] relaxed mode [of] learning . 
A|58| A: [uh] okay bye-bye . 
B|59| B: [and] _so i_ [and i] wanted her [to] _put_ [it] into [the] computer [and then] print [it] _out_ [and] make [a] book [with] [it] [you know] . 
A|60| A: yes . 
B|61| B: [well [i think] that's true] [and i] [uh] now [we] [generally] [don't] buy [a] warranty [because] [you] [think] [you know] [at] least [for _the] first_ couple [of] [years] nothing should [go] wrong [with] [it .] 
A|62| A: [yeah] [or] [sometimes] [they] [don't like] [either] [of the] choices [for the] candidates 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] [well i] [had] [a] friend [that] [uh] visited [england] [not] [well i think it's] been [probably] two [years] now [but] [that's] her next goal [and] she _can_ [do] [it] [is] [go] back [to england] [because] she [really] has [a] _great_ desire _to [do_ that] [because] [the] _love_ [that] she [um] has [for] [it] now after visiting [it .] 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [i mean] usually [you know] _you go_ [to] work before _they're_ awake [or] as _they're_ getting [up] [for] school [and you] get home [and] [it's] already dark _unless_ [it's] summer [time] [you know] [. and] even [in] summer [time] [sometimes] [you] get home [so] late [that] there's [you know] [you] can't [do] _anything_ [with] [them] . 
A|66| A: [i mean] [if i'm] dying [if] [i] [know] [i'm] dying [you] [can] experiment [on] me . 
B|67| B: [i] [i] everything [is] [so] automated [uh] [and] things [can] [be] made without [i think] [a] human hand [ever] touching [it] [you know] an awful [lot of] things 
A|68| A: [and] [they] didn't [used to] [be] _actually_ [but they] got [kind of] wild [and] weren't doing very [well] [inside] [so i] [put] [them] outside [once] [i] got [a] [house] [and] [they're] doing [great] [out] [there] [they] [love] [it .] [but] [the other] [one] [the first] [one] [i] got [he] doesn't want [anything] [to do] [with] outside [unless] you're [there] . 
B|69| B: [um] [actually] [one] [of] my favorite instruments [is] [a] harpsichord . 
A|70| A: [well] [i'll] let [you go] [it's] 
B|71| B: [i think] our concept [of] news isn't necessarily events [that] happen . [it's] more negative [like] [you] said . 
A|72| A: [and uh] [once] [you] kill off [a] few [of] [them] 
B|73| B: [right .]
