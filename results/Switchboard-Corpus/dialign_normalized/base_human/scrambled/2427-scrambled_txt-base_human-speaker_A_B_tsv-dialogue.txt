B|47| B: [a] [bit] 
A|48| A: _i just_ _think_ [that] everybody ought _to _do_ it ._ 
B|49| B: _were_ _you up_ _in in_ wisconsin [or] _would _you_ go_ _into_ where _would you_ camp ?

B|53| B: [yeah] _our_ biggest way [of] saving _money_ [is] [then] [to] stop [all] these deductions _um_ [you know] _is to_ [let's] [see] _now i_ _forget_ which way [we] [do it _.] we don't_ list [all] [the] deductions [and then] _we get_ [more] _money_ [back] [you know] _at the_ _end_ _of the_ year 
A|54| A: [that] _would be_ [really] awful . 
B|55| B: [right] [yeah .] 
A|56| A: [oh] [my] gosh . _people are_ crazy . 
B|57| B: [well] [do] [you] _exercise_ regularly judy ? 
A|58| A: [that's] entering [the] _day_ _as_ _well ._ 
B|59| B: [i think] five _minutes_ _is the_ max . 
A|60| A: [and] _she's_ _on the_ yearbook staff [and] _things _like_ that_ [so i] [can] help _her_ _with_ [that] _and she_ gives [me] ideas [for] [my] writing [too] [so .] 
B|61| B: [and] _one_ _of the_ fish [was] missing [and they] _couldn't_ find [it] anyplace [they] _couldn't_ figure [out] [what] [had] _happened_ [and then] [they] found [it] fried [on the] radiator behind . 
A|62| A: [oh] [my] gosh . 
B|63| B: _i'm_ _sorry_ [we] [are] [not] getting rid _of the_ cats .

B|65| B: [the] west _part_ _of the_ _state_ [is] [and then] _the east_ _part_ _of the_ _state_ [has] _got_ [all] [the] bleeding hearts _and all_ [the] welfare cases [so .] 
A|66| A: [so] [then] [that] [so] [that] throws [out] [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then] [. so] [it's] [i don't [know] .] [it's] _very_ [it's] [it's] _uh you know_ [it's a] [it's a] topsy-turvy world _and _it's_ really_ [something] [how] [um] _political_ ideas [and] viewpoints within [one] country [can] vary [so] _much_ [and] _also_ within [um] within [a] 
B|67| B: _yeah [and_ i] [like] [it .] 
A|68| A: [but _i] think it_ finally sunk [in] [you know] [because] _she_ saw _some_ [of _the] other_ [people] [and] [just] [like] _she_ _heard_ [them] [say] [you know] _well i_ _used_ [a credit card] _. _and_ my_ husband's sister [is the] world's worst [at] [oh] [well] _i'll_ [just] _use the_ [credit] cards _and she_ [has] _all of_ _her_ [credit] cards [up] _to the_ limit . 
B|69| B: [but]

A|80| A: [so] [it] [might] [have [to] be] [something] [that] [they] [might] consider [doing] _as a_ [that's] _got [to_ _be] very_ short term . 
B|81| B: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] 
A|82| A: _wow_ [. yeah .]

B|89| B: _is that right ?_ [i've] _never_ [heard] [of] [that .] 
A|90| A: [yeah]

[and] they] bred [a dog] _that i_ [it's called] [a] _an_ animal's critical span which [basically] translates [to] [how] [much] shit [will] [it] [take] before [it] bites _you _._ that_ _german shepherd_ [the] american _german shepherd_ [here] _was _a_ _a_ a_ such _an_ unreliable animal _that the_ american seeing eye institute refused [to] [use] [them] [because] [they] [would] turn [on] [on] _their_ handlers . 
A|92| A: _well that's_ [yeah .]

A|104| A: [i _know] [that_ that] [uh-huh _.] and [i_ don't [know] [.] uh] [what] [would _you] do_ [to] change [it] ? [to] _make it_ [better] ?

B|165| B: [okay] [uh i've] [the] high _school_ [i] went [to] [was uh] [was [a] good] [one] [also] [. and i] [well i guess] [you could] [say] [one] [of the] problems [with the] _public_ education system [is the] disparity between [different] schools . [because] [the] [one] [i] went [to] [was] [you know] [i'm] _sure_ _a [a_ lot] nicer [than] [you know] [a lot [of] the] inner city schools [and the] [things] around _atlanta ._ 
A|166| A: [um] [i'm] [a] co-op student [so i] [work] [and] [go] [to] [school] [about] halftime _.

B|173| B: [so] [my] brother's wife [and my] husband [and i] went . last year [we] wanted [to] [show] [my] husband [what a] [baseball] game [was] [because] [you know] [being] [a] non-american [you] [want [to] see] [what a] [baseball] game [is] [like] . 
A|174| A: [and uh] [so] _we _had_ to_ [make] _some_ adjustments [because] [we] [really] [are] [kind of] _looking for_ [something] [that] [we] [want _to] do_ _and he_ wants _to do_ [that's] satisfactory [and] [we've] [been] [here] seven months [and] he's _still_ hasn't hit [up] [on] _anything_ permanently . 
B|175| B: [so] you've [been] [all] [through] europe .
