B|3| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|4| A: [yeah .]

A|8| A: _but_ _it's_ nice _having_ _a dog_ _here_ _, uh _, the_ ,_ 
B|9| B: _but _,_ i mean _,_ that's_ _going to_ tend _to _, i_ mean_ _it seems_ [to] _me_ [that] _sort of_ approach _will_ tend [to] simply _make_ [the] _cost_ [of] committing [the] crime [slightly] higher _in other_ words , you've increased [the] probability [of] _somebody_ _being_ caught [a little bit] _. the_ _real_ question _is_ _how_ [do] _you_ convince [people] _not_ _to commit_ such crimes _in the_ _first_ place . 
A|10| A: _exactly_ . 
B|11| B: _it's a_ long skinny _one_ _and ,_ 
A|12| A: _i don't_ let [that] worry _me _._ and i_ [get] [the] milk lukewarm _and then_ [i] pour _about a half a_ cup [of] cornstarch [in] _it _and_ i have_ _this_ _thing_ _it's called_ [the] slender blender _, _it_ , it_ makes _the , _uh ,_ it_ makes _, uh , a_ whip topping _out_ [of] milk [if] _you get_ [the] milk cold enough . _it's [,_ _uh , i] don't [know_ , they're] _called_ moo goo leaves _or something_ [they're]

A|14| A: _well , i_ _i just_ _feel_ _like_ _there's_ _a lot of_ murderers [and] rapists _, _and_ everything_ else , [just] walking [the] streets _. [you_ know] ? 
B|15| B: [exactly] , 
A|16| A: what's [really] _bad about_ those _though_ [is] [just] _like_ young [people] [if they] _don't_ _, you know , we_ _take_ _the time_ [to [,] you know ,] help [my] daughter , _she's_ [in] college ,

B|27| B: _that's great_ . 
A|28| A: [yeah .] 
B|29| B: _so _,_ um ,_ 
A|30| A: [and] _is that_ supported [by] _all_ donations _to the_ church [and so] forth _or ,_

A|34| A: _and you_ _don't_ _want to_ ? 
B|35| B: [i know] [and see] _a credit card_ 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [uh , i] _say that_ _health care_ [is] probably _definitely_ _number_ _one_ _though ._ [want to] _just [,_ you know _,] all_ _your_ salary can't _even_ begin _to pay_ _for_ _what you_ _can_ wind _up_ losing [, you know] _in _a_ major_ illness _or something [._ uh] . 
A|38| A: [and _,] not_ [being] [, you know ,] 
B|39| B: _huh ._ 
A|40| A: [uh-huh _.] i think_ [that's] [right ,] 
B|41| B: _right ._ 
A|42| A: _yeah . yeah ._ 
B|43| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: _and you_ _also_ [get _a] lot _of_ [,_ uh ,] juries [are] _extremely_ [, uh [,] and] [from] [what] [i] hear _, i _, i_ have_ _, i have_ _some_ friends _who_ [do] expert witness testimony _and they_ [say [that] [,] uh ,] juries [are] _extremely_ vulnerable _to , uh ,_ [sort of] emotional pitches [, you know [,] the] prosecutor [will] [want [to] [,] oh _,] i don't know_ _show_ [the ,] _show_ [the] mugging victim [, you know ,] _show_ [what the] nice person _he was_ _and _what_ a_ [family] [life] [, and] _basically_ [get] [the] jury [to _be] very_ sympathetic _with the_ victim _, and , uh _,_ or _,_ or [,_ uh _,] if_ [it's a] corporation [, that] _was _, uh ,_ you know ,_ harming _some_ _individual_ [or something] _like [that_ [,] they] [get] _very_ _much _,_ well [,_ you know _,] it's just_ _a big_ faceless corporation . _let's_ _, let's_ [make] _them_ [pay] _as much_ _as_ possible . _things _like_ _that_ ._ 
B|45| B: _uh-huh , [uh-huh_ [.] [yeah .] yeah _.] so [i_ [, i] don't know] _in , in_ terms [of] _other_ [things] , _other_ _benefits_ _other_ _than_ [sort of] monetary _i'd_ [, you know [,] i _,] yeah [,_ we] [, we] _do _._ we_ _have to_ contribute [a] certain amount [, uh ,] [to] _it ._ 
A|46| A: [uh-huh _.] so [,_ [it] seems] _like a_ [of] [people] live [there] [, and then] _through_ appeals . 
B|47| B: [a] [bit] 
A|48| A: _i just_ _think_ [that] everybody ought _to _do_ it ._ 
B|49| B: _were_ _you up_ _in , in_ wisconsin [or] _would _you_ go_ _into_ where _would you_ camp ? 
A|50| A: [exactly] . [exactly] . 
B|51| B: _were_ _any_ _of them_ twins ? 
A|52| A: _yeah , it's_ tough . [it's] tough . 
B|53| B: [yeah] _our_ biggest way [of] saving _money_ [is] [then] [to] stop [all] these deductions _, um [,_ you know _,] _is_ [to_ [,] let's] [see] , _now , i_ _forget_ which way [we] [do it _.] we don't_ list [all] [the] deductions [and then] _we get_ [more] _money_ [back] [, you know ,] _at the_ _end_ _of the_ year , 
A|54| A: [that] _would be_ [really] awful . 
B|55| B: [right _,] yeah ._ 
A|56| A: [oh] [my] gosh . _people are_ crazy . 
B|57| B: [well ,] [do] [you] _exercise_ regularly , judy ? 
A|58| A: [that's] entering [the] _day_ _as_ _well ._ 
B|59| B: [i think] five _minutes_ _is the_ max . 
A|60| A: [and] _she's_ _on the_ yearbook staff [and] _things _like_ that_ [so i] [can] help _her_ _with_ [that] _and she_ gives [me] ideas [for] [my] writing [too] [so .] 
B|61| B: [and] _one_ _of the_ fish [was] missing [and they] _couldn't_ find [it] anyplace [, they] _couldn't_ figure [out] [what] [had] _happened_ [and then] [they] found [it] fried _on [,_ the] radiator behind . 
A|62| A: [oh] [my] gosh . 
B|63| B: _i'm_ _sorry_ [, we] [are] [not] getting rid _of the_ cats . 
A|64| A: [well [,] [yeah .] yeah .] 
B|65| B: [the] west _part_ _of the_ _state_ [is] [and then] _the east_ _part_ _of the_ _state_ [has] _got_ [all] [the] bleeding hearts _and all_ [the] welfare cases [so .] 
A|66| A: [so] [then] [that] [so] [that] throws [out] [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then] [. so] [it's] [i don't [know] .] [it's] _very_ [it's] [it's] [uh] [you know] [it's a] [it's a] topsy-turvy world _and _it's_ really_ [something] [how] [um] _political_ ideas [and] viewpoints within [one] country [can] vary [so] _much_ [and] _also_ within [um] within [a ,] 
B|67| B: _yeah [, and_ i] [like] [it .] 
A|68| A: [but] _i think it_ finally sunk [in [,] you know _,] because_ _she_ saw _some_ [of _the] other_ [people] [and] [just] [like] _she_ _heard_ [them] [say] [, you know _,] well , i_ _used_ [a credit card] _. _and_ my_ husband's sister [is the] world's worst [at] [, oh _,] well ,_ _i'll_ [just] _use the_ [credit] cards _and she_ [has] _all of_ _her_ [credit] cards [up] _to the_ limit . 
B|69| B: _but ,_ 
A|70| A: [but] _certainly_ _not ,_ 
B|71| B: hi . 
A|72| A: [so] [that's] [a] difficult situation . 
B|73| B: _no_ [, [i] would] agree [with] _you _._ we_ haven't [had] [too] [much _,] _but_ [,_ uh ,] historically , _we've_ _always_ [, uh ,] almost _been [like_ [a] big] brother [to _,] [in_ [,] and] [to the] latin american _area_ [, and , uh ,] almost [used] _them [,_ i [, i] , i] [feel] . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: [um] [yeah . yeah .] 
B|77| B: [i think] technology [is] _better_ _, i'm_ _, _i'm_ not sure_ [. i think] you've _got [a_ good] point [with the] plastic [and] [that .] 
A|78| A: [so [,] i don't] [, i don't] [even] [know] _who_ [your] favorite team _is ,_ actually . 
B|79| B: [yeah _,] i'm_ _kind of _,_ i'm_ _kind of_ [bad about] [it .] 
A|80| A: [so] [it] [might] [have [to] be] [something] [that] [they] [might] consider [doing] _as a_ [that's] _got [to_ _be] very_ short term . 
B|81| B: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] 
A|82| A: _wow_ [. yeah .] 
B|83| B: [well [,] [and] the] [thing] [with] bundy [was] [though] [he] escaped 
A|84| A: [oh] _no ._ 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] although lately [i have] _noticed_ [, you know ,] [even] [if i] gain _, like_ two pounds [, i] start [, i] start feeling [it [and] ,] 
A|86| A: _okay_ [, um _,] what_ _baseball_ team [are] [you] familiar [with] ? 
B|87| B: _and , uh [, i_ [, _i] think] it's_ coming [up] [here] soon . 
A|88| A: [right .] 
B|89| B: _is that right ?_ [i've] _never_ [heard] [of] [that .] 
A|90| A: [yeah] 
B|91| B: [and what] _happened_ [is _,] [is_ that] [people] wanted [this] _shepherd_ [to] _shepherd_ [and] protect [. [and] they] bred [a dog] [that] [i] [it's called] [a ,] _an_ animal's critical span which [basically] translates [to] [how] [much] shit [will] [it] [take] before [it] bites _you _._ that_ _german shepherd_ [, the] american _german shepherd_ [here] _was _a_ , _a_ , a_ such _an_ unreliable animal _that the_ american seeing eye institute refused [to] [use] _them [,_ because] [they] [would] turn [on] [on] _their_ handlers . 
A|92| A: _well , that's_ [, yeah .] 
B|93| B: [so ,] social changes aren't [that] [much] [for] [me] either . 
A|94| A: _yes_ . 
B|95| B: johnny elway . 
A|96| A: [and] _course_ [in the] spring [we get] [the] bluebonnets [and] indian paintbrush .

A|98| A: huh-uh . 
B|99| B: _uh-huh [,_ yeah .] 
A|100| A: [now] [i] [noticed] [just] _the other_ _day_ [in the] paper [that , that] medicare [will] [be] _based_ , payments [will] [be] _based_ _not [,_ uh ,] [just] [on] [cost] [, but] [on] [cost] effectiveness [. so i] 
B|101| B: _when_ [they] rollback _an hour_ . 
A|102| A: [uh [,] they] classify most [of them] _as_ professionals . 
B|103| B: _twenty_ thousand dollars [a] year [, if] [they're] lucky [. i] [wouldn't] [do it] [for] [that .] 
A|104| A: [i _know] [that_ , that] [uh-huh _.] and [,_ i don't [know] [.] [uh] _,] what_ [would _you] do_ [to] change [it] ? [to] _make it_ [better] ? 
B|105| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [uh ,] _look_ [at] [them [,] in] england , margaret thatcher [was] prime minister [, uh ,] indira ghandi [, uh [,] in] india , 
B|107| B: [you] [too] . 
A|108| A: [yeah [,] i mean [,] and] [that's] [just] maybe [because] [of the] [little] [more] [, they] said celebrated [that [,] uh ,] he's _not _the_ only_ [one] [, you know ,] 
B|109| B: _oh , yeah ._ 
A|110| A: [yeah [,] _it] is_ hard

A|112| A: [you] miss _the whole_ _thing ._ 
B|113| B: [yeah .] [well] _i had_ [, _i] had_ [a] _german shepherd_ before [this] [one] [and] _when_ [she] _died_ [it] _just [,_ it] [just] absolutely destroyed [me [.] _i] mean _i_ was _just_ [,_ you know ,] 
A|114| A: [yeah [,] that's] _fun_ _. uh-huh ._

B|117| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|118| A: _well , i guess_ we'll [first] [have [to] [get] to] [used] [to the] idea [that] we're staying [here] 
B|119| B: _it's [not_ [,] not] [to] [me] personally _, [no_ .] 
A|120| A: [is that right ?] [that's] [it] ? 
B|121| B: [and [it's] [,] well [,] they] [certainly] [are] living off _our_ [at] _our_ expense . 
A|122| A: [one] [little] ball _here and_ [there] [, [yeah ,] and] [this] guy's beating [you _up] _,_ [so_ [,] i don't know] [the] beating [up] [part] [. [i ,] i] actually [feel] [the] tennis balls _would hurt_ .

A|124| A: gee . 
B|125| B: [uh-huh [.] you] bet . 
A|126| A: [i mean [i] don't [know] .] [all] [i'm] [saying] [is] [i think it's] scarier [than] [we] [know [.] [uh] [,] or] maybe [they] understand [but ,] 
B|127| B: farming ? 
A|128| A: [uh-huh , uh-huh [,] _well ,] [that's_ great] , that'd [be] _a lot of_ _fun_ [. you] [have _a] lot_ [good] experiences [from] [that [.] yeah .]

B|133| B: [how] [about] _you ?_ [do] [you] [pay] [too] [much] ? 
A|134| A: [of] _course_ [, _you know ,] _it_ is_ [so] weird , cause [no] [one] [will] _ever_ [really] [know _,] it's [,_ [it] _,] so_ [but] [it's] entertaining [and] [it] makes [you] [think] [about] _things ._ 
B|135| B: [oh] . [oh [,] that] sounds [so] pretty . 
A|136| A: [i] wonder [how] [many] [of] [his] lives [he] missed _, when_ [that] [happened] . 
B|137| B: _and it's not_ [a] city [, not] incorporated , [my] nearest neighbor's [about a half a] mile [at] least [, i] can't [even] [see] _their_ _house_ [and , uh ,] 
A|138| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|139| B: [yeah .] [like] [in] may case [, i have] three children *spelling: 'may' _should_ [be] 'my' [from] ages nine [to] two [. _and [,] it's_ just] unfeasible [for] [me] [to] try [to [get] a] _job_ [because] [all] [the] _money_ [that] [i would] , [be] making [would be] _going to_ [day] _care_ . 
A|140| A: _and [, and_ [,] in] spite [of ,] 
B|141| B: [that] sounds [like] [it] [would hurt] [more] . 
A|142| A: [so] [they] [think] [, well [,] you know ,] why vote . 
B|143| B: [that's] _kind of_ sad . [well ,] anyway . 
A|144| A: _and , um ,_ [going] over [that] pass [is] [just] [a] [real] nightmare . 
B|145| B: [wow] , 
A|146| A: _there's_ _a lot of_ positive [things] [with] [it _,] [so_ .]

A|148| A: bye [now] . 
B|149| B: [oh ,] _we've_ [got] [, well] [the] two [that] _were_ outside [, they're] [like] brothers [, i mean] [i've] _never_ seen two cats [so] close . 
A|150| A: worst [thing] [in] [life] [is _to] [have_ to] repair [something .] 
B|151| B: [uh-huh [.] yeah [.] uh-huh .] 
A|152| A: you're [definitely] [right ,] 
B|153| B: [my] wife [would] love [that] 
A|154| A: [and then] mom gets [to] [take] _care _of_ [it_ [,] [or] something _.] so [,_ i] 
B|155| B: [you] [too] . 
A|156| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|157| B: [you _know ,] they_ buy [a] place [and _they] just_ _hate_ [the] _area ._

B|159| B: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] 
A|160| A: [the] utah jazz . 
B|161| B: [and , um [,] so] [you] sit [there] [and you] wait _for the_ longest [time] [really] bored [, and then] [all _of] a_ sudden [something] happens [but] [you] happen [to] [look] [the other] way during [the time] , 
A|162| A: [yeah . [yeah] _,] well , i_ am [, i'm] [a big] football fan [. i] [never] [my] father [was a] football fan [my] _whole_ [life] _and he_ [used] _to have_ [the] football pool [at the] office [and all] [this] [stuff] [and [i] just] hated _it _. and_ i think_ [i was just] mad [because] [he] spent [so] [much] [time] watching football [on] sundays . 
B|163| B: [no] , _sometimes_ [we] ride [and] _sometimes_ _, uh , we_ , pull [, we] [like] [to ,] [to [, uh ,] [a] lot [of] the] times [just] walk [, uh ,] _for the_ [exercise] . [but] 
A|164| A: [yeah ,] isn't [it] funny . 
B|165| B: [okay] [uh , i've] [, the] high _school_ [i] went [to] [was , uh ,] [was [a] good] [one] [also] [. and [i] [,] [well , i] guess] [you could] [say] [one] [of the] problems [with the] _public_ education system [is the] disparity between [different] schools . [because] [the] [one] [i] went [to] [was [,] you know [,] i'm] _sure_ _a , [a_ lot] nicer [than] [, you know [,] [a] lot [of] the] inner city schools [and the] [things] around _atlanta ._ 
A|166| A: [um [,] i'm] [a] co-op student [so i] [work] [and] [go] [to] [school] [about] halftime _.

B|169| B: [i] stay [in the] _house_ [because] [it's just [,] it's just] [too] hot . 
A|170| A: [and , uh [,] [so] [,] and] sundays [, uh , we] usually [have] [, [all] of] [our] [kids] [are] over [on] sunday [, [so] _,] you know , [we_ don't] [get] [into] [that ,] except [that] [sometimes] we'll [get] [into] [their] home videos 
B|171| B: [yeah _, it's] really_ neat [. and _, uh ,] uh ,_ [course] _i've been_ working [on] [it] [for] five [years] [, [but] [,] you know ,]

B|173| B: [so] [my] brother's wife [and my] husband [and i] went . last year [we] wanted [to] [show] [my] husband [what a] [baseball] game [was] [because] [, you know ,] [being] [a] non-american [you] [want [to] see] [what a] [baseball] game [is] [like] .
