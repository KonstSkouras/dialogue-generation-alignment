A|0| A: _and _,_ uh ,_ now tonight _i_ just finished _up with_ _that_ _a_ woman called jackie , did _you_ watch did _you_ watch _it ?_ 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _well , _i_ have_ _this_ new fondue pot _and i_ _was_ going _to_ _do_ basic cheese fondue _, _and_ _i_ have_ two different kinds _of_ breads _and_ _some_ ham _and i_ _was_ going _to_ try something weird which _, you know ,_ _when _you_ have_ fish au gratin _, i_ _was_ going _to_ make _some_ _, uh ,_ like fish chunks _and_ dip _it_ _in_ _the_ fondue _. _i_ don't know_ if _it_ will come _out_ . 
B|3| B: [and i] pay [a] lot [of] property taxes . 
A|4| A: _but ,_ 
B|5| B: _how_ long [do] [you have] [to] bake [it ?] 
A|6| A: _i think_ [you] couldn't make [it] _with_ [a] _hand_ whisk or , or [a] regular beater _but ,_ um , 
B|7| B: _those_ , _so_ _you're_ talking _about_ ones [in] [a] lower , lower end , price range . 
A|8| A: _oh ,_ okay . 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [so] _sometimes_ _it's_ hard _to ,_ [to] _know_ exactly _when_ _, _but_ _,_ _i_ don't know ,_ if _she_ acts like _she_ wants [to] or says _she_ wants [to] maybe [you] could [have] her take _some_ for [a] while [and] _see_ [how] _she_ likes _it ._ 
B|11| B: [and [,] and] _it was_ [a] _real_ positive thing [, but] _on_ [the] other [hand] [you] [don't] want [to ,] you'd be _one_ [of] these _people_ [that] dumps [the] kittens off _on_ [the] side _of the_ road [, you know ,] 
A|12| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: _well ,_ we actually planned for [about] [one] year . 
B|15| B: [sometimes] [when you] lose someone [that] [you] _really_ love [, _you] do_ [some] crazy _things_ [i don't know ,] 
A|16| A: [and _,] uh ,_ _kind of_ [have] , if [you're] having [the] pressures [of] school [and _,] uh ,_ everything else _, it's_ _kind _of_ ,_ course _it's_ [really] [, you know ,] _as_ soon _as_ [you do] [it] _, it's_ [really] [a] release . 
B|17| B: [see] [i] tape murder [she] wrote . 
A|18| A: [and ,] um , there's children [in] her classroom [that] just totally disrupt [the] classroom , where [the] teacher cannot teach 
B|19| B: yeah . 
A|20| A: _right_ . 
B|21| B: [but] _my_ youngest son _is_ [a] skier . 
A|22| A: [it was] nice [to] isolate [it] [to] [one] particular community _that they_ [have] trouble [, you know ,] _they_ just _as_ soon _not_ approve [of] anyway [, _but] [,_ but] [that] isn't [how] [it was] [in] africa . 
B|23| B: more luxury . [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _right_ . 
B|25| B: _and then_ god gave _me_ [this] dog , [so] 
A|26| A: exactly , although [so] much per month anyway . 
B|27| B: yes , we're [not] too long distance today . 
A|28| A: _oh _,_ that's_ , [my] husband's into _, uh ,_ computers . 
B|29| B: yeah , lyndon larouche [, that's] [it .] 
A|30| A: _uh ,_ while [i] [was] sitting here waiting while _they_ tried [to] find somebody for [me] [to] talk [to ,] trying [to] _think_ [of] what _, uh , uh ,_ what [things] were important _, uh ,_ besides salary [and] _a [,_ and] [a] job _. i_ guess _, uh ,_ list [i] _had_ scribbled down [was] [the] [people] [you] worked _with_ [and] maybe _the _,_ uh _,_ the_ challenge [of the] _work [and_ _,] uh_ [the] working conditions , [things] like [that] . 
B|31| B: yeah [. [i] have] [a] lot [of [,] uh , uh ,] computer books [that] [i] am [, i] [do] computer [work and] [so] [i have] [a] lot [of] _those_ . [so] [, i] spend [a] lot [of] time looking through _those_ , [not] necessarily reading _them_ [but ,] looking through _them_ . 
A|32| A: _well [,_ you know ,] 
B|33| B: [but [,] uh [,] [i] think] [that] [as] far [as] quality [of] food goes [the] [some] [of the] most expensive places i've been [had] [the] [the ,] [really] _the , the worst_ quality [of] food . 
A|34| A: [so] [you do] [that] [and ,] _right_ [, [and] then] we try [to] [do] [a] family activity [on] saturday , usually [in] [the] morning . 
B|35| B: [oh ,] yeah . [you] bet [you] . [you] bet [you] . [you know] [how] [they] came [up with] [the] retriever , [don't] [you] [, the] golden ? 
A|36| A: [it] sure does [. i] made mistake [one] year [and] planted [some] cantaloupe , [my] goodness , what [a] mistake [that] [was] . 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] [well , i] thought [was] funny [that they] kept pushing [the] three eighty-six s x even though _the , the_ price difference _is_ [about] ten dollars . 
A|38| A: [the , the worst] place [was] [in] marrakech 
B|39| B: [uh ,] [she] goes [to] [a] home . [this] _is_ [a [,] uh ,] [a] couple [, uh ,] emigrated _from_ china early [in] , [in] their _lives_ . 
A|40| A: saint claude _is that_ sound familiar ? 
B|41| B: absolutely . 
A|42| A: [but [,] but] _see ,_ [they] make [that] clear [to] [them] [as] [they] hire [those] guys what , what [the] drug testing schedule [is] . 
B|43| B: [oh ,] [uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [i] mean , he [lives] _all_ [in] [that] same area going [from] mount lebanon , um _, it's_ [real] pretty [up] there . _it's_ just , 
B|45| B: [is that] [right] ? 
A|46| A: [well ,] 
B|47| B: [see ,] [so] , plastic [, it's] [all] [out] [of] plastic . 
A|48| A: [right] [, that's] [a] good idea . 
B|49| B: [well , [i] think] [that] would be [kind of] drastic punishment .
