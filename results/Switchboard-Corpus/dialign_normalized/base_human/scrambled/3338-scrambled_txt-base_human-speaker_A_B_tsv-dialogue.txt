A|16| A: good [to] hear [from] [you] .

B|39| B: [that] _we _,_ we_ wake up [to] television news _and , uh [,_ uh ,] shower [and] dress [, and] whatever [to] [that [,] _and] then_ [because] [of] [the] fact [that] [my] wife [and i] ride [to] work together [, uh [,] in] [a] car _, _we_ _,_ we_ chat at [each other] rather than , than [something] else . 
A|40| A: [well [,] they] haven't [, they] haven't , [have] [they] [just] lost [one] game [this] year ? 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] _right ._ 
A|42| A: [i] bet [it] had [a] pretty coat too . 
B|43| B: [oh .] 
A|44| A: _did_ [you] _really_ ? [what] , black ones ? 
B|45| B: [i [,] i think] [so [,] [and] [,] and] there's _always_ _the [,_ uh _,] the [,_ uh [,] the] old [, uh ,] saying [that] keeps coming up [that] [if] [a] person wants [a] gun bad [enough] they'll , they'll [get] _one [,_ _and] , uh [,_ _and] then_ [, uh] . 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [that's] true [if] , [if] [it's] [on] [the] credit card [it] doesn't [seem] _like it's_ money [out of] _your_ pocket . _sometimes_ [you] may [think] _, well _, i_ don't have_ [the] money _so you_ use [the] credit card [it's] [like] fake money _or something ._ 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] _well , _it_ sounds like_ ours [are] pretty [similar] _. i_ live [in] [one [,] i don't have] [a] swimming pool [. and] mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot . 
B|49| B: [well [, it] [,] it] [is] [, it [,] you know ,] [on] [the] [other] hand _you ,_ you've got [, uh ,] you've got _the [,_ uh [,] the] possibility [of people] [, oh ,] you've got some [people] could [be] arrested [for] [, uh ,] drug use , drug dealings [and] things [like] [that [,] _and] , uh ,_ [if] their , [if] their employers name hits [the] papers [and] _that _it's_ , _it's_ , it's a_ mark against _them_ , 
A|50| A: go ahead . 
B|51| B: [oh] [that's] [one] [of] [the] requirements [i] asked him [. i] said , [now] [you] [do] [like] _cats_ [, _right] [._ we] [don't] 
A|52| A: [um _,] [so_ you] [like] [to listen] _to [,_ uh _,] _a_ lot_ [of] music [, _or] _do_ ,_ [is] [it] talk shows . 
B|53| B: [if] _you're_ [, like] _i've_ [, i] work [with] [, uh ,] computer systems [a lot] . [so] [it's] [kind of] hard [to] say [, you know] . [if] _you're_ _, you know , a_ brick layer , _somebody_ _can_ look [and] _see_ [, you know [,] well [,] yeah [,] you] laid [, you know ,] fifteen thousand bricks today [and] [they] were [all] straight [and] _your_ building didn't fall down [, you know] [yeah [,] you] [did] [a great] job . _but_ [if] [you] build computer systems [, like] [, well [,] you know ,] [what] does [that] computer program [really] [do [,] you know] . [or] , especially [if] [you] write [like] papers [, you know] . [or do] design studies _or something ._ 
A|54| A: huh . 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and , uh ,] 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: _yes_ [, well [, i] think] [sometimes] _when_ [people] [get to] [be] [a] certain age , [other] [people] [have] [to] [kind of] help [them] _make_ decisions [. it] sure wouldn't [have] been granny's decision [to] leave us [and] go back [to] [a] nursing home [, but] she's accepted [it] real [well] [now] 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: there _has_ [, that's] [right .] 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] [and] _the] [,_ the] laws [are] [all] [, the] rules . some [of] [the] things [that] _would_ [make] sense [to , to] tell [the] jury [, that] [this] , [this] guy [has] [a] [, a] prior criminal history [, you know ,] where [he's] raped ten women 
A|62| A: [and then] [the] river _was_ [really] nice _because it_ wasn't too frightening [, _but] it_ wasn't [, you know ,] too easy either . 
B|63| B: [and] [they] clean [it] up . 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [but] [that's] [, uh ,] [they're] [, so] close [, i [,] i don't] consider mexican [people] [in] [the same] category [with] [, uh ,] especially [like] [, uh ,] [people] who come [from] cultures [that] [don't have] [the same] [, uh ,] [kind of] moral upbringing [that] [we] [have] . 
A|66| A: [uh [,] i don't] [, i don't] [know] [because] [the] [cats] pretty much , [um [,] yeah [,] [we] can] leave [them] [for] [a] weekend as long as [we] put plenty [of] food [out] , 
B|67| B: [yes] . 
A|68| A: [well ,] those [are] skills [that] she certainly [is] _going to_ [need] early [on] [and [,] you know [,] the [,] _and] it_ seems [like it's] getting earlier [and] earlier [with] [the] [children .] 
B|69| B: everyone knows [they're] [going] [get ,] [not] [going to] [get] [out] . 
A|70| A: [oh .] those aren't too pleasant . 
B|71| B: [so] [i know] [it sounds like] [a] rationalization [but] _it's [,_ i] [really] [think it's] true [for] our [family] [, [and] [i] think] [it] [has] worked very [well] . 
A|72| A: [i mean] [it would] probably [be] [like] [your] [house] [on [,] uh [,] you know , a] half [a] city block [in] pittsburgh [or something .] 
B|73| B: okay [, well] 
A|74| A: [well [,] well] [i've] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [right .] [have] [to] agree [with] [you [,] and] i'm [kind of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also [. i] [just] [don't] [think] [that] [it] acts much as [a] deterrent [to] these [people] [because , uh [,] you] still [see] [them] committing [the same] crimes [, but] [, i] [tend to] agree [with] [you] [that [,] uh [,] we] should [have] [it] [i] [just] [, i don't] [know] [that it's] [always] effective [but] [i] guess [we [,] uh ,] we're [kind of] stuck [with] [it] . [it's , it's a] difficult [, uh ,] problem , isn't [it [,] to] determine how [you're] [going to] punish [somebody] [for] [a] particular crime [, uh ,] 
B|77| B: [and the] [people] i'd most likely want [to] sentence [to] death [are] [the] [people] [that] [just] show [a] [really] low regard [for] human [life] . [that [,] you know [,] [you] ,] never [know] [when] [they're] [going to] turn [or] hurt [the] next person [because it] doesn't [really] matter [to] [them] whether someone else gets hurt [or] [not] . 
A|78| A: [i mean ,] i'm [not] kidding [you] . 
B|79| B: [oh [,] [i] know] [it] [the] last gubernatorial race [was] [, oh] [it was] awful . 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [yeah [,] [it's] , it's] stopped around here at ten [and it] goes into night programs , at [that] point which could [be] [one] [of] [, you know ,] many different night programs [but it] goes into night programs . 
A|84| A: [yeah] 
B|85| B: [but] . 
A|86| A: [right .]
