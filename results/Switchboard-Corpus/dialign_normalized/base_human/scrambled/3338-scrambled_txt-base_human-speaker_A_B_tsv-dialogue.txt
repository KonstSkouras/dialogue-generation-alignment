A|30| A: _oh ._ 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: _they're_ [just] getting [uh] put [on] probation _or something_ [because] [the] prisons _don't have_ _enough_ room [so] [they] [get] [they] [get] lighter sentences 
B|33| B: _i mean_ [they] 
A|34| A: [if] [i] [have] _people_ over [for] dinner [i] [like] _it_ [to] [be] nice [and] relaxed .

A|36| A: [that's] _kind of_ [what] [like] his parents [have] [uh] land [that] [they] retired [to] [um] about [a] hundred miles _out of_ atlanta [and] [in] georgia 
B|37| B: [yeah [.] _it] would_ [be] [great] _i mean_ [uh] [the] glasses [that] [the] exams themselves [are] [not] expensive [it's] [the] glasses . 
A|38| A: yep . 
B|39| B: [that] [we] [we] wake up [to] television news _and uh_ [uh] shower [and] dress [and] whatever [to] [that] _and then_ [because] [of] [the] fact [that] [my] wife [and i] ride [to] work together [uh] [in] [a] car [we] [we] chat at [each other] rather than than [something] else . 
A|40| A: [well] [they] haven't [they] haven't [have] [they] [just] lost [one] game [this] year ? 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] _right ._ 
A|42| A: [i] bet [it] had [a] pretty coat too . 
B|43| B: [oh .] 
A|44| A: _did_ [you] _really_ ? [what] black ones ? 
B|45| B: [i] [i think] [so] [and] [and] there's _always_ [the] [uh] [the] [uh] [the] old [uh] saying [that] keeps coming up [that] [if] [a] person wants [a] gun bad [enough] they'll they'll [get] [one] _and uh_ _and then_ [uh] . 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [that's] true [if] [if] [it's] [on] [the] credit card [it] doesn't [seem] _like it's_ money [out of] _your_ pocket . _sometimes_ [you] may [think] _well _i_ don't have_ [the] money _so you_ use [the] credit card [it's] [like] fake money _or something ._ 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] _well _it_ sounds like_ ours [are] pretty [similar] _. i_ live [in] [one] [i don't have] [a] swimming pool [. and] mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot . 
B|49| B: [well it] [it] _is it_ [you know] [on] [the] [other] hand [you] you've got [uh] you've got [the] [uh] [the] possibility [of people] [oh] you've got some [people] could [be] arrested [for] [uh] drug use drug dealings [and] things [like] [that] _and uh_ [if] their [if] their employers name hits [the] papers [and] _that _it's_ _it's_ it's a_ mark against _them_ 
A|50| A: go ahead . 
B|51| B: [oh] [that's] [one] [of] [the] requirements [i] asked him [. i] said [now] [you] [do] [like] _cats_ _right [._ we] [don't] 
A|52| A: [um] [so you] [like] [to listen] [to] [uh] _a lot_ [of] music _or do_ [is it] talk shows . 
B|53| B: [if] _you're_ [like] _i've_ [i] work [with] [uh] computer systems [a lot] . [so] [it's] [kind of] hard [to] say [you know] . [if] _you're_ _you know a_ brick layer _somebody_ _can_ look [and] _see_ [you know] [well] [yeah] [you] laid [you know] fifteen thousand bricks today [and] [they] were [all] straight [and] _your_ building didn't fall down [you know] [yeah] [you] [did] [a great] job . _but_ [if] [you] build computer systems [like] [well] [you know] [what] does [that] computer program [really] [do] [you know] . [or] especially [if] [you] write [like] papers [you know] . [or do] design studies _or something ._ 
A|54| A: huh . 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and uh] 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: _yes_ [well [i] think] [sometimes] _when_ [people] [get to] [be] [a] certain age [other] [people] [have] [to] [kind of] help [them] _make_ decisions [. it] sure wouldn't [have] been granny's decision [to] leave us [and] go back [to] [a] nursing home [but] she's accepted [it] real [well] [now] 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: there _has_ [that's] [right .] 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] [and] the] [the] laws [are] [all] [the] rules . some [of] [the] things [that] _would_ [make] sense [to to] tell [the] jury [that] [this] [this] guy [has] [a] [a] prior criminal history [you know] where [he's] raped ten women 
A|62| A: [and then] [the] river _was_ [really] nice _because it_ wasn't too frightening _but it_ wasn't [you know] too easy either . 
B|63| B: [and] [they] clean [it] up . 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [but] [that's] [uh] [they're] [so] close [i] [i don't] consider mexican [people] [in] [the same] category [with] [uh] especially [like] [uh] [people] who come [from] cultures [that] [don't have] [the same] [uh] [kind of] moral upbringing [that] [we] [have] . 
A|66| A: [uh] [i don't] [i don't] [know] [because] [the] [cats] pretty much [um] [yeah] [we can] leave [them] [for] [a] weekend as long as [we] put plenty [of] food [out] 
B|67| B: [yes] . 
A|68| A: [well] those [are] skills [that] she certainly [is] _going to_ [need] early [on] [and] [you know] [the] _and it_ seems [like it's] getting earlier [and] earlier [with] [the] [children .] 
B|69| B: everyone knows [they're] [going] [get] [not] [going to] [get] [out] . 
A|70| A: [oh .] those aren't too pleasant . 
B|71| B: [so [i] know] [it sounds like] [a] rationalization [but] [it's] [i] [really] [think it's] true [for] our [family] [and [i] think] [it] [has] worked very [well] . 
A|72| A: [i mean] [it would] probably [be] [like] [your] [house] [on] [uh] [you know a] half [a] city block [in] pittsburgh [or something .] 
B|73| B: okay [well] 
A|74| A: [well] [well] [i've] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [right .] [have] [to] agree [with] [you] [and] i'm [kind of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also [. i] [just] [don't] [think] [that] [it] acts much as [a] deterrent [to] these [people] [because uh] [you] still [see] [them] committing [the same] crimes [but] [i] [tend to] agree [with] [you] [that] [uh] [we] should [have] [it] [i] [just] [i don't] [know] [that it's] [always] effective [but] [i] guess [we] [uh] we're [kind of] stuck [with] [it] . [it's it's a] difficult [uh] problem isn't [it] [to] determine how [you're] [going to] punish [somebody] [for] [a] particular crime [uh] 
B|77| B: [and the] [people] i'd most likely want [to] sentence [to] death [are] [the] [people] [that] [just] show [a] [really] low regard [for] human [life] . [that] [you know] [you] never [know] [when] [they're] [going to] turn [or] hurt [the] next person [because it] doesn't [really] matter [to] [them] whether someone else gets hurt [or] [not] . 
A|78| A: [i mean] i'm [not] kidding [you] . 
B|79| B: [oh] [i know] [it] [the] last gubernatorial race [was] [oh] [it was] awful . 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [yeah] [it's it's] stopped around here at ten [and it] goes into night programs at [that] point which could [be] [one] [of] [you know] many different night programs [but it] goes into night programs . 
A|84| A: [yeah] 
B|85| B: [but] . 
A|86| A: [right .]
