A|30| A: [with] children , 
B|31| B: _um_ . 
A|32| A: worked _at_ [a] camp [there] [, _and] so_ [i] _got to_ _spend_ [a] lot [of] _time_ [up] _in the_ mountains . [so] [that's] [probably] [my] favorite place _when _i_ have_ [to] _go_ somewhere [on] [a] vacation .

B|45| B: _i guess_ . [but] [we're] _going to_ try [that [,] and] [see] _how_ [that] works . 
A|46| A: [uh [,] [i] guess] [my] feelings [are] [that _,] uh , we_ almost _have a_ universal [health] care system [, uh ,] [to] [a] _great_ degree , except [that] [now] [i] read [where] _we've_ left _out_ [about] thirty-four million _people ._ 
B|47| B: _i mean _,_ i _, i_ [have_ a] friend who [, if] she likes _something_ , isn't sure _what_ _size_ _somebody_ _might_ need , [will] buy [it] [in] [every] color [and] _size_ [and [,] you know ,] [take] everything _back_ again 
A|48| A: [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [right _.] [right_ .] [oh ,] definitely motherhood [is] devalued [in this] society [. _if] you're_ , [stay] [at] home [and] _you're_ [a] mother , [it's] [like] _what_ [a] waste . [people] _think [,_ you know [,] you] _should_ [be] fulfilling yourself

A|56| A: _um [, i_ think] [if] _they_ [, if] _they_ started executing _them_ [on] [a] regular basis [, uh ,] [that] [i think] [it] [might] make [a] difference [. right] _now _, i_ don't_ [see] [it] making [a] difference . 
B|57| B: [okay [,] uh] . 
A|58| A: _i [know_ ,] two [of] [my] daughters [had] [to] [have] [that] [and] _they_ started having extractions [at] age eight [, uh _,] because_ _they_ [just] [had] too many teeth [for] their [size] mouth . 
B|59| B: _but [,_ uh , we] _feel_ _real_ fortunate [and] [we] [were] able _to [,_ uh ,] _just , uh ,_ choose [in the] marketplace _. i _don't_ know what_ [it's] [like] _around_ [, uh ,] hattiesburg . 
A|60| A: _um ,_ i'd let [it] cook [just] [a] little bit [just] [so] [that] [the] cooking goes [a] little faster . 
B|61| B: [and] [she's] [so] _easy_ [going] [and so] sociable , 
A|62| A: north [of] pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 
B|63| B: [uh-huh [.] well [,] i think] _so ,_ [it] puts [you] [out] [on] your own [and] [and] [in a] [time] after [high] school _, um ,_ _there's_ [kind of] [a] selfishness , 
A|64| A: _do_ [you] _ever_ watch [that] ? 
B|65| B: [yeah [.] [right] [,] and] especially [if] [you have _a] family_ . 
A|66| A: _yes_ . _yes [,_ and] sometimes [now] [we're] getting [that [,] uh _,] the_ [other] football [where] _they_ play [it] inside [, [and] [you] know ,] [this] [is] [a] [, you know ,] [this] [is] too _much_ saturdays [and] sunday , [this] [is] fine _, but_ _do_ [we] [have] [to] carry [this] [on] _into_ [the] summer [and the] spring [you know ,] [all] [of [that] ,] 
B|67| B: _and , uh ,_ then after [that _,] i ,_ [my] sister lives [in] turkey _, so_ [when i] _was_ [like] fourteen , fifteen [, i] _went_ [, i] _went_ [to] turkey . 
A|68| A: [and [it] was [just] , uh ,] amazing [to] me [, and] [of] course _they_ made [a] _big_ deal [out] _of the , the_ few [that] _got_ _out and_ turned [around] [and] committed [a] crime within five days [of] getting [out] [, and] being rearrested _an_ . 
B|69| B: physics . 
A|70| A: [and] [that] [went] over [real] [well ,] 
B|71| B: [it was] [like] [we] can't [take] _it back_ you've _got _,_ we've [got_ to] keep [it] [now] . 
A|72| A: [and] _as far as_ [the] [other] states [, i] honestly [don't know what] their capital punishment [is] _. you know [,_ i [, i] ,] _haven't_ kept [up [,] you know ,] [anything] , _like that_ . 
B|73| B: _but ,_ 
A|74| A: [yeah ,] [that] cocoa [, [yeah] _,] the_ unsweetened . [it] comes [in] [like] [a] [real] dark [can] , 
B|75| B: [um [,] i'm] twenty .

A|78| A: [yeah [,] [we] all] _used [to_ ,] 
B|79| B: [uh-huh [.] _yeah] . uh-huh ._ 
A|80| A: [but] _they're_ [a] lot [more] trouble than cats _actually_ . 
B|81| B: [we all] [go] _back_ [to] parents' houses _on the_ weekends [, and] [what] [not] _so ,_ 
A|82| A: [and , [uh ,] so] _they_ cancelled [that] [one] [and , uh ,] [are] looking next [year] _bringing_ [it back] closer _, but_ [we] [have a] letter , [a family] letter , [that] circulates , 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [yeah .] 
B|85| B: [i [don't] know what] [it's] [like] [now [, i] haven't] [been] [back] [up] [there] [in] awhile . 
A|86| A: _i [know_ [,] i] _do_ too [, i ,] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four kids [and] _they_ _feel like_ [, you know [,] that's] _really_ why god [and] some _of the_ [people] _in our_ church use birth control [and] some [of] _them_ [don't [,] i] [had] [my] tubes tied [so you] , 
B|87| B: [yeah [,] but] [at] [the] same [time [,] i [don't] [know] ,] [it's] _pretty_ [far] [to] throw [that] [far] [i] couldn't [do it .] 
A|88| A: [and] [there] [are] times [i [think] ,] gee [, i] [should] _give_ [my] kids 
B|89| B: [yeah _,] and , uh [,_ an] part [of the , the] movie [is] [where] he's trying [to] [clean] [this] [dog] [up] [and] [it's ,] [it's] [just] hysterical . 
A|90| A: [true .] 
B|91| B: _you're_ still trying [to] dry [out] ? 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .]

B|99| B: [i] thought _that was_ _on the_ upswing again [now] . 
A|100| A: [okay] . 
B|101| B: [yeah] _i mean [,_ [i] know] [that's] [what] [my] father-in-law [was] talking [about] _, you know , [when_ you] [give] [these] [people] _money_ [or ,] [what] [was] [it] [they were] [bringing] [up] points asking [as far as] whether [they] need [to] [give] [, um ,] [more] _money_ [to] [these] [people] _, i mean [,_ and] [that's not] [really] [the] answer _, i mean [,_ because] [if] [they're] alcoholics they'll [just] [go] [out and] [spend] , [it] [on [,] you know ,] booze [or] _something_ [like [that] ,] 
A|102| A: [and] [i'm] [kind of] [like] [, yeah [.] i] shall , [they] [would] _do that_ [because] [at] least [somebody] [was] getting [the] [money] [out] [of] [it _,] you know ._ [that was] [going to] use [it] [for] good [, [so] ,] 
B|103| B: mine's broke [at] [the] moment [, but]

B|107| B: [oh , yeah .] 
A|108| A: [yeah , i] agree [, i _,] i've [,_ _i have] [,_ uh ,] [a] low tolerance [for] [that] [kind of] [, uh ,] [that] [kind of] _person_ . [and , uh ,] [as far as] _, uh , you know_ [there] [are] some , some [other] crimes [that] [i [think] _,] uh [, you know_ [,] uh ,] kidnapping [, um [,] you know , when] [they] [, i mean] kidnapping per se [has a] certain [, uh [,] uh ,] fine [and] penalty associated [with] [it ,] 
B|109| B: [yes [,] uh-huh] [, that's] [it]
