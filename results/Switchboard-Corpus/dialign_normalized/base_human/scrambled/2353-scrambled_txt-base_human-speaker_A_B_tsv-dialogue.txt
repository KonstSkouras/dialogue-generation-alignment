B|33| B: [yeah _, i] think_ _it's _,_ it's_ _somewhat_ [a [,] uh ,] symptom [of our] , me generation _and [that_ _,] we_ [think] _we_ need _all_ these _things_ [and [i] think] _my_ parents _always_ [, you know ,] [did] without _or_ saved _up_ _to , you know ,_ buy _things_ [and] _we_ consider [that] [so] many [of] these _things_ _we_ _just_ _have _to_ have , you know _,_ like_ _when i_ first _got_ _my_ apartment [and _i] was_ setting [it] _up_ _i did_ try [to] economize [some] [but] [, you know [,] _i] was_ _just_ _like _,_ _well [,_ _i_ have] _to_ have_ [it] _all_ furnished [and _i] have _to_ have_ _all of_ _my_ kitchen setup _and you_ [don't [,] you know _,] do_ without _too_ [much] [and , you know [,] _that's] how i_ _got_ started _kind of_ [with] setting _up_ [a] household _all_ _up_ [, you know ,] [it] _kind of_ _like [,_ _in] the_ short amount [of] [time] . [you know [,] you] _just_ _have _to_ have_ these _things_ _just [, you_ know ,] [have] [them] _at home_ , _have _to_ have_ [them] _at_ _my_ own place [and] _that's _,_ you know , a_ big expenditure [to] [start] _, um [,_ buying] _all_ these _things that _you_ think_ _or , or_ _have _to_ have_ [and] _actually_ [they're] _kind of_ luxuries _or_ _you should_ save _up_ slowly [and] keep [buying] [them and] [not] _just_ rush [out] [and] furnish [the] _whole_ place [, you know ,] [going] [in one] big swoop , save _up_ _and then_ buy [it .] 
A|34| A: _yeah . uh-huh ._ 
B|35| B: forty-two cents [out] [of] every dollar [i] make goes _to [the_ government] _, and then_ [they] charge me sales tax [and] [they] charge me gasoline taxes ,
