B|25| B: [oh] [okay] . 
A|26| A: my understanding [of] how _it was_ framed [is] [that you] [this] [the] thing about [this] country [is] [that you can] disagree [with] its government [and] [you can] display [that] . 
B|27| B: huh [yeah .] 
A|28| A: [yeah .] 
B|29| B: [right] [right] . 
A|30| A: [but] [uh] [this year] my husband recharged our freon because _it was_ needed _to be_ done _and one of the_ cans released entire amount [of] freon into [the] [uh] into [the] air because _he_ opened [it] 
B|31| B: [and] [he] spends well [right] now he's down [to] like once [a] week [but] [he] [was] going [over] [there] several times [a] week [to be] [with] [the] [family] [and] help [them] [with] [the] language . 
A|32| A: [so] . just [don't] mind me [if] [i] bounce back [and] forth .
