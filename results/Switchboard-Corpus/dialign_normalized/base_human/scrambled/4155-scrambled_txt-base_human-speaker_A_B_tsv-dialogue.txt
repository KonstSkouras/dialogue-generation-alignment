A|34| A: [uh] [and] although [i] can't afford [it] _right_ [now] [i] _would_ just [like] love [to] [have] [one] . 
B|35| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: [yeah] [i] _kind of_ [i] haven't been keeping up [with] [football] [i] mean [in] [the] fall [i] [i] can [go] [on] [and] [on] _about_ [football] [but] since [it's] _kind of_ [off] season [it's] _kind of_ hard [to] _think_ back _about_ _all that_ [. but uh] 
B|37| B: [the the] penalty phase [yeah] they've decide [the] penalty separately [from the] verdict . 
A|38| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: [and] i've applied [at] another district [where] [many] _of the_ children [are] asian .

B|43| B: _oh ._ 
A|44| A: [uh] some [of those] countries were [so] safe [it] was unreal . singapore [is] _very_ supposed [to be] _very_ safe [and] [in] fact tokyo [and] [i] thought tokyo _would be_ dangerous being such [a] huge large city [with] [so] [many] [people] 
B|45| B: [yeah [.] and] she still likes [to] [get] [time] [which] i've [never] liked [very] [much]

B|53| B: [you] [do] [the] same . 
A|54| A: sounds [like] [a] place [where] [i] grew up

A|56| A: [but] boy three hundred dollars [a] week doesn't [go] [very] far [on] child [care] . 
B|57| B: [oh] [is] she still [there] ? 
A|58| A: [yeah] [but] [you you] [think] [that] [i] mean if [you] [think] [of] _how_ [many] premeditated murders [are] committed [you know] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] _how_ [many] [people are] being sent [that] doesn't seem [like] [very] [many] . 
B|59| B: [because] they'll arrest someone _and you know_ [go] through [all that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and [you] [have] to] [even] [be] _careful_ [how] [you] arrest [them] [how] [you] talk [to them] _uh you know_ [what] [they] [say] 
A|60| A: [because] [it's] [all] geothermal . 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] i] _you know [i_ think] [it] [would be] [good] [for [a] lot of people] [to] [get] involved [in] [that] [kind of] program 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [i] [don't] [really] see [the] emphasis [on] things [like] peace corps [like] [we] [you know] [we] saw back [i] guess [in] [the] carter administration 
B|65| B: [no] . 
A|66| A: yes [and you know] [we] [have uh] needs [in] our [life] [that] [are] unique [to] us [and] [uh you know] [people] [have] needs [in] their [life] [that] unique [to] us [to them] . 
B|67| B: [and] [they] [they] [have] [a] [you] [a good] appetite 
A|68| A: [and you] feel stupid doing [that] [but we] did [it] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [oh .] 
B|71| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [it's] [yeah] that's why [we] not sure [we] we're not sure [we] want [to] [uh] buy [down] here [because] [we] actually [we] lived up north long enough [to] appreciate [the] [um] *listen--one utt ? minneapolis-saint paul [is] [very] clean 
B|73| B: [oh] okay . 
A|74| A: [you know i] [don't know] your feelings toward [that] [. i] guess [we] shouldn't [get] into [that] [but] [um] [and] [what] else [um] [i think] [in] some ways [that] [they] need [to be] more [careful] [of the] teachers [that] [they] hire .
