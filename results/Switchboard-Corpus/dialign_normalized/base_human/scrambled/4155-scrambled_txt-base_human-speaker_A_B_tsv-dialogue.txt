A|30| A: [and] [i'm] saying let's move _right_ [on] 
B|31| B: [but ,] [what] happens [is] [we] _used to_ fight [a lot] [, so there's never] [much] [of a] family family [thing] [. [you] know ,] [one] [of those] hell family vacations . 
A|32| A: [you] feel [it] , [don't] [you] ? 
B|33| B: probably [, yeah] [yeah _.] but , uh ,_ [no] [, [it's] [,] it's] sad , though _, [that_ [,] uh _,] that_ [the] _people ,_ though _, that_ _you _, you_ ,_ somebody's _life_ [is] [in] twelve people's hands [and] sometimes [those] twelve [people] could _care_ _less_ . 
A|34| A: [uh [,] _and] ,_ although [i] can't afford [it] _right_ [now] _, i_ _would_ just [like] love [to] [have] [one] . 
B|35| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: [yeah _,] i_ _kind [of_ _,] i_ haven't been keeping up [with] [football] _, i_ mean , [in] [the] fall _i _,_ i_ can [go] [on] [and] [on] _about_ [football] , [but] since [it's] _kind of_ [off] season [, it's] _kind of_ hard [to] _think_ back _about_ _all that_ [. but , uh ,] 
B|37| B: [the , the] penalty phase [, yeah ,] they've , decide [the] penalty separately [from the] verdict . 
A|38| A: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
B|39| B: [and ,] i've applied [at] another district [where] [many] _of the_ children [are] asian . 
A|40| A: wow . 
B|41| B: [uh ,] 
A|42| A: [they] [do] . [well ,] [it] was _very_ _good_ [it] just takes up [, you know ,] [like] [you] _say [,_ a lot of] your garden area . 
B|43| B: _oh ._ 
A|44| A: [uh ,] some [of those] countries were [so] safe , [it] was unreal . singapore [is] _very_ , supposed [to be] _very_ safe [and ,] [in] fact , tokyo [, and] [i] thought tokyo _would be_ dangerous being such [a] huge large city [with] [so] [many] [people ,] 
B|45| B: [yeah [.] and] she still likes [to] [get] [time] [which] i've [never] liked [very] [much] 
A|46| A: [uh ,] [but] [yeah [,] that] was _, i_ highly recommend [that] way [to go] . if you're ever interested [in] going [the] route _, i_ dealt [with] _this_ woman , her name was rita [at] china tours [in] boston 
B|47| B: [they're] seen as senile 
A|48| A: [i] [never] [get] home early enough _for_ [those] [five] [and six] o'clock , 
B|49| B: [i'm] [about] fifteen miles [out] . 
A|50| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [you] [don't know] [what] [happened to] gabriel's fire [then] ? 
A|52| A: why [do] [you] _think_ [that] [it's] [less] close than [it] [used [to] be] ? 
B|53| B: [you] [do] [the] same . 
A|54| A: sounds [like] [a] place [where] [i] grew up 
B|55| B: [but i think] [we] [would] make [a] bigger investment [in] kids , we'd [have] fewer decisions [to] make . _down_ [the] road [, you know] . 
A|56| A: [but] boy three hundred dollars [a] week doesn't [go] [very] far [on] child [care] . 
B|57| B: [oh ,] [is] she still [there] ? 
A|58| A: [yeah ,] [but [,] [you ,] you] [think] [that _,] i_ mean if [you] [think] [of] _how_ [many] premeditated murders [are] committed [, you know ,] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] _how_ [many] [people are] being sent [, that] doesn't seem [like] [very] [many] . 
B|59| B: [because] they'll arrest someone _and , you know ,_ [go] through [all that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this [,] and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and [you] [have] to] [even] [be] _careful_ [how] [you] arrest [them ,] [how] [you] talk [to them _,] uh , you know ,_ [what] [they] [say ,] 
A|60| A: [because] [it's] [all] geothermal . 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] [i] [,] _you know [,] i_ think] [it] [would be] [good] [for [a] lot of people] [to] [get] involved [in] [that] [kind of] program , 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] [yeah _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [i] [don't] [really] see [the] emphasis [on] things [like] peace corps , [like] [we] [, you know ,] [we] saw back [, i] guess , [in] [the] carter administration , 
B|65| B: [no] . 
A|66| A: yes [, [and] , you know ,] [we] [have , uh ,] needs [in] our [life] [that] [are] unique [to] us [and [,] uh , you know ,] [people] [have] needs [in] their [life] [that] unique [to] us [, [to] them] . 
B|67| B: [and ,] [they] , [they] , [have] [a] [, you [,] [a] good] appetite 
A|68| A: [and you] feel stupid doing [that] [but we] did [it] , 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [oh .] 
B|71| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [it's [,] yeah ,] that's why [we] not sure , [we] , we're not sure [we] want [to [,] uh ,] buy [down] here , [because] [we] actually , [we] lived up north long enough [to] appreciate [the [,] um ,] *listen--one utt ? minneapolis-saint paul [is] [very] clean 
B|73| B: [oh ,] okay . 
A|74| A: [you know , i] [don't know] your feelings toward [that] [. i] guess [we] shouldn't [get] into [that] [but [,] um [,] and] [what] else [, um [,] i think] [in] some ways [that] [they] need [to be] more [careful] [of the] teachers [that] [they] hire .
