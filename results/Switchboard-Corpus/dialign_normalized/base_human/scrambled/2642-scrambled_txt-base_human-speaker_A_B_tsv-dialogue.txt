A|38| A: [right .] 
B|39| B: _and [i_ think] [one] [of the] [big] [things that] [you] [can] [do] [is] , [to] increase deterrence [is] [, uh [,] if] someone [is] found guilty [of] _a [,_ uh ,] felony level offense , [they] lose their citizenship . [and they] lose their constitutional rights . _you know ,_

B|43| B: [we] _could_ [go] _around_ [, _and] ,_ boy _and ,_ 
A|44| A: [now] [we] haven't watched any [of] _those_ . 
B|45| B: [um ,] kalachandji's . [it's] [, uh ,] [it's] [a] hari krishna run restaurant . 
A|46| A: [i ,] 
B|47| B: only [in] america [is] there [a] dog called [a] german shepherd . 
A|48| A: [i think ,] [yes] . 
B|49| B: _and [i_ , i think] there's [an] attempt [to] [do] [that] . _you know [,_ i think] [people] , there's [a] mild attempt _for_ _that _,_ [but_ [i] think] basically [, we] basically associate news _with_ bad news [or , or] catastrophes [or] problems [or] crises [, [or] , uh _,] you _know_ ._ 
A|50| A: [well ,] he [could] always [get] past [, you know ,] he'd [get] past [like] six [or] seven tackles [and just] keep spinning _around and_ [get] on [into] [the end] zone [. [but] [, um ,] i] guess [you] never [could] [really] _see_ him play [, because] [with] [the] cowboys , while he [was] [with] [the] team [, the] rest [of the] team [was] [pretty] poor [so] [you] couldn't [really] [tell] [if] [it was just] him [or] [the] team [and i] always [just] assumed [that] he [was] [too] _good_ [for] [the] rest [of the] team [. [but] [,] [i] don't] [know .] 
B|51| B: [oh [,] uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [yes] . 
B|53| B: [it] comes [from] trees . how [can] [it] be bad ? 
A|54| A: [uh [,] we] [have] no basement [i don't] [know ,] 
B|55| B: [but ,] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [oh [,] uh-huh [.] yeah _,] i , i_ [like] [some of] his songs , though . they're , they're [not] _so ,_ they're [not] [so] sad [country] [all] [the] time . they're [just] _kind of_ sweet sometimes . 
A|58| A: _and the_ discipline [that] [my] daughter receives [now] [in] going [to] school [is] [just] totally [different] . 
B|59| B: [and they] [had] [all] kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep _and everything _,_ you know , all_ [out in] _this_ , [in [the] ,] [in] _this_ schoolyard there [. so] [we] [just] said , hey , let's stop [and] [and the] kids [got] [to] [go] [around _and] [,_ you know ,] [see] pigs [and] animals [and] [things] [like] _that ,_ 
A|60| A: [yeah ,] [that's] _good_ . 
B|61| B: [oh] . 
A|62| A: [yeah .] 
B|63| B: [and] unfortunately [the] [the ,] lately [the] courts [have] _been_ deciding [that] [those] [could] be paid [for] by insurance _too ._ 
A|64| A: [i] guess , [i'm] , [i'm] [a] student _right [now_ [and] [i] don't] make [a] whole lot [of] money [and [,] [so] [,] i , [i] kind of] [don't] pay [a] proportionate amount [of] taxes [to [,] i] guess [, uh ,] compared [to] _what i_ [get] [, because] [i [,] you know , all] [my] , [my] education [is] state sponsored . [i] [go] [to] [a] state sponsored school [and , uh ,] [my] education [all] up through high school [and] [stuff] [, so i] guess [i'm] [kind of] [in] debt [, i , i] suppose [, because] [i don't] [, you know ,] [been] paying taxes [all] [that [,] all] [that] [long] . [my] parents [, i] guess , however , [have] contributed [to] [that [,] you know ,] [for] [the] education side [of] [it] [and everything [,] but , uh , i] usually [end] up getting money back .

A|70| A: [really] . [i] usually [have] , [too .] 
B|71| B: [well ,] [it] sounds [like] [a] [good] buy . 
A|72| A: [yeah ,] are [they] [, um [,] just] house pets ?
