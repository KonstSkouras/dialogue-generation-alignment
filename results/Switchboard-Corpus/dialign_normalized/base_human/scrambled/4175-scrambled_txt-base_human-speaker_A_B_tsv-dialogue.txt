A|48| A: [how] [about the] health food [uh] restaurants ? [well] [like] [this] [one] [but it's] probably [not] advertised as such [is] [it] ? _or_ 
B|49| B: [yeah .] 
A|50| A: _my_ kids [are] involved [in] sports . _my_ daughter [has] played basketball [for six] years [and] _my_ son plays football [. i] _my_ rule _is _that_ they_ can't play [a] sport [the] same time _of the_ year [because] [there's] _just_ [not] enough [of] _me_ [to] [drive] [them] around everywhere . 
B|51| B: [it's] [a little] _place_ looks [like] [a] castle .

B|53| B: [i] [uh _i] _i_ [i_ don't] [think] [the] judge _should_ [just] [make] [the] decision alone . 
A|54| A: [yeah] [we] [uh] she's [uh] [into] aerobics [and uh] [and] [we] [did] aerobics together [for] [about] [a] month [and a] half 
B|55| B: philadelphia ? 
A|56| A: [yeah] [that's] very true . [you know] [how] many [is] [it] [they] say [we] [have] [so] many lawyers [in] [this] _country_ [and] [i] guess [i i] live _near_ washington being [in] [in] baltimore [it's] something [like] [one] [in] [four] [people] [in the] washington area [are] lawyers 
B|57| B: _oh_ [uh-huh . yeah .] 
A|58| A: [oh] _really ._ [oh] [well] [that's] [a] _nice_ _nice_ story . [um] . 
B|59| B: [oh] [yeah] [we've] _all_ [four] [of] ours [are] house cats . 
A|60| A: [yeah [.] uh] very 
B|61| B: [oh] wow . 
A|62| A: [they] [were] . [that's] _right_ . [we] use _a lot_ [we] sure [do] . 
B|63| B: [not] _with_ [me] personally _. it is_ _with_ _a lot of_ [other] [people] . 
A|64| A: [so] he [gets] [a] break [two] days [a] week [but it's] [only] [for] [like] [two] _or_ [three] hours _at_ [a] time . 
B|65| B: [yeah] _there_ _you go_ . 
A|66| A: [and] he'd never been outside [like] [you know] [by] himself outside . 
B|67| B: [really .] [that was] smart [. yeah .] 
A|68| A: okay . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [yes] [. [i] think] [we] ought [to] worry [about] [our] own species . 
B|71| B: [yeah [.] [i] i] usually [get] [it] started [for] [my] wife 
A|72| A: _huh ._ 
B|73| B: [yes] [i] love [to] cook . 
A|74| A: [i don't] [know] [. yeah] [our] leaves [are] [are] [all] [on] [on] [the] ground now [. [i] think] [it was] _an_ especially good winter [for] fall colors . 
B|75| B: [and] [um] [it] scares [me] _a little bit_ [to] _think [that_ they] [would] begin restricting gun control [to] [the] point _where_ [um] eventually [we] _may_ [not be] able [to] [have] [that] [right] _any_ [more] . 
A|76| A: [yeah] [yeah . well] [i'm] [uh] [i'm a] second lieutenant [in the] air force [and] [so] [i] travel [a lot] . 
B|77| B: [oh] [yeah . well] most [of my] camping [i] haven't done [much] since [i] [was] [a] kid [but uh] we'd basically take [the] tent [up] [in the] sierras [and uh] usually [just] camp [near] [some] _stream_ _or some_ lake . 
A|78| A: [and] [i'm] hoping especially [with] those big tall sides [on] [there] [it] [that] _maybe_ [i] won't [have] [oh] i'll [have] less [of] [a] bug problem _at_ least [they] they'll [have] [a] hard time crawling [up] [the [thing] .] 
B|79| B: sort [of] easy listening [because] [you] [like] [country] [but] then 
A|80| A: taxes . 
B|81| B: [you] could [be] responsible [for] [that] yourself . 
A|82| A: [well] _that's interesting_ . 
B|83| B: easiest _way_ _out_ [maybe] . [no] [i don't] _think it's_ [a] monetary [thing .] 
A|84| A: [the] next generation [uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [oh] . 
A|86| A: [so] they're happening during [the] hours they're gone from work . 
B|87| B: [really .] 
A|88| A: [right] [you know] [they] they'd figure [a] [way] around [that] [one] [in] [a] heartbeat [. but] [i'm] wondering [if] [there's] another issue here [and] [maybe] [this] [is] why [this] [has] died [out] . [can] [you go] [into] [and] [this] wasn't [the] [question] [but it's it] [may] [be] [the] [more] _of the_ issue versus [should] young adults [can] [they] [go] [in] [there] [and] [can] anyone [go] [into] [well] [out _of] the_ kurdish community [is [a] little bit] extreme _at_ [this] time [but] say [i think] bangladesh [would] [have] been [a] good example [or some] [some] [really] desperate situation [and] teach [them] [to] farm [and] teach [them] [and it] doesn't [do] [any] good . 
B|89| B: [the] dallas cowgirls [huh .] 
A|90| A: [i i] [i'd] force [them] [. [i] [think] that] [uh [i] think] [it] [would] [be] [i think] [i think] [a lot of] kids actually [do] [a lot of] work [and] [no] [one] [just] realizes [it .] 
B|91| B: [i'm] sold [on] nissans . 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [well] [it was] [nice] [to] talk [to] [you] [. [i] know] they've started over [in] richardson _where_ [my] dad lives . [they] pick [up] newspapers [i think] . 
A|94| A: [right] [or] [you] [don't] [know] [what] [they] [you know] [where] [they] stand [or] anything [like] [that] . 
B|95| B: wow ! [that] [really] surprises [me] . 
A|96| A: five minutes [oh] okay . 
B|97| B: [so] [it's] [uh] [uh] [you know it's] [a] [it's] [a] [it's] [an] _important_ decision [it's] [an] industry [that's] [still] [a] cottage industry 
A|98| A: [i] i'll agree [it it's not] your responsibility [but] [is] [it] _also_ legal [for] [you] [to] [do] [that] ? from [what] [i] understand from various net readings [it] [the] federal government [is] going [to] try [to] legislate [a] [more] aggressive enforcement [of] state tax schemes [uh] [in] [into] [place] [in the] next few years [. it is] [it [is] a] lost revenue [stream] [right] now [and] states [can] use [all] [the] revenue [they] [can get] . [with] [some] [with] something [like] [that] [do] your arguments [still] apply ? 
B|99| B: [i think] [one] [of the] things [that's interesting] [to] [me] [is] [if you] look particularly [at] [the] political changes [is [that] the] [they] seem [to be] social [they] seem [to be] economically driven [also] . 
A|100| A: [yeah [i] [think] [it's] really] [important] [to] [that] [that] [if you] [get] [a] pet [that] they're either spayed [or] neutered [so] [that] [you know] we're [not] [just] going [on] [with] [this] pet population [and] having [to] [just] [get] rid [of] [them] .
