B|7| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|8| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|9| B: _and _you_ ,_ _you'd_ _still ,_ _there's_ _still_ mitigating circumstances

B|11| B: [yeah .] 
A|12| A: [yeah .] _and so_ _i don't_ _like to_ arrive _, or_ _, or_ _when_ _they_ arrive , [for] _me_ _to be_ completely worn [out] . 
B|13| B: _yeah ,_ _right ._ _right [._ but] _still_ _there_ _are_ , _there_ _are_ _other_ _people_ _there_ doing _the ,_ doing _the same_ _thing_ . 
A|14| A: [so , _we] had_ [to] [, _we] had_ [to] flea bath [them] _and _it_ [was ,_ uh [,] _it] was_ _an_ experience [that] _they_ didn't enjoy _at_ [all] . 
B|15| B: [yeah .] _what do _you_ [,_ where] _do you_ [like to] camp ? _how do you_ [like to] camp ? 
A|16| A: [it's] amazing [how] [, uh ,] [how] much [, uh [,] it] changes _, and i_ weigh _probably_ _about [the_ same] [i] weighed [for] _, oh _,_ i don't know how_ many [years , but , uh _,] it's_ changed places [and] things _don't_ fit [just] quite _exactly_ fit [the same] . 
B|17| B: [and _it] is _,_ i would_ imagine [in] terms _of ,_ [of] size [and so] forth [, it's] relatively typical _for the_ area _. it_ _might_ [be] _, i would_ [say] [it's] [probably] midsized _for the_ area . _there_ _are_ _some_ smaller [, and] _there_ _are_ _, you know ,_ _several_ larger . 
A|18| A: _they_ _don't_ look [a] [thing] [a] _like ,_ 
B|19| B: [i] _feel_ _sorry_ [for] her . 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [that's] been , 
A|22| A: [and] ours start _at_ , _at_ , _at_ , _at_ eight [and] end _at_ eleven _, that's why_ [we] [. _i] [, i_ would] _actually_ [like] [it] better _if_ _everything_ started _at_ seven [and] ended _at_ _ten_ . 
B|23| B: _oh ._ 
A|24| A: [you know [,] that] [just] _really_ rubbed _me_ [the] wrong _way_ . 
B|25| B: _yeah _,_ yeah ,_ 
A|26| A: [and] she thinks [, yeah ,] twenty-five percent [. _it] [,_ _it] was_ [a] small school 
B|27| B: [uh _,] you know , _and_ , and_ generally [when] _i was_ growing _up [a_ lot of] those _people_ _, the_ only _time_ [i] _ever_ saw [them] [was] _at the_ reunion _, so [,_ uh] 
A|28| A: _because_ [all the] models [of] teaching english [are] based _on_ teaching english [to] spanish speakers _or_ [to] [other] european language speakers . [and] [people] _don't_ realize [how] different [some] _of the_ languages _they_ speak [are] . 
B|29| B: _okay_ . 
A|30| A: [and so] _i think_ _, um [,_ it's] become _real_ important [to] _me_ _that we_ try [to] spend [time] together as [a] family . [so] [there's] _one_ _or_ _two_ nights [a] week [, we] _have a_ , _on_ monday nights [we] set aside [time] [where] [it's] called [, uh ,] family home evening [and] [we] stay home [that] evening , [all] [of] us [, and] [we] [do] things together . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [you] _think_ _about it_ [and] [it's] _really _, i don't_ _know_ ._ _this_ country kind [of] takes [the] worst care _of the_ elderly [of] any [other] country . 
B|33| B: [and] [the] _kids_ _want to_ swing , 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: _you're_ kidding . 
A|36| A: _i like_ [that] . _and then_ [, uh [,] my] husband , he [just] [, uh ,] subscribed [to] [a] wood , he [just] started [a] woodwork [so] he [just] sent away [to] get [some] woodworking books . 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: _yes ._ 
B|39| B: [oh _,] well [,_ that's] _nice_ . 
A|40| A: [in] [a lot [of] [,] well ,] especially [in] things [, you] pick [up] _the paper [,_ [and] _you] read_ [, you know [,] you] _think_ _, oh_ [my] goodness 
B|41| B: [oh [,] well [,] it's] [not] [that] long ago [. [it] was [,] oh ,] twelve times , _of the year ._ 
A|42| A: _they're_ [not] _going_ [to] _take_ [that] money [you] give [them] [and] [go] try [to] figure [out a] _way_ [to] dry [out] _with_ [it .] [now] come _on_ , let's [be] realistic , 
B|43| B: pardon ? [i'm] studying speech pathology . 
A|44| A: _well , i_ guess we've exhausted [that] _one_ .

A|52| A: [yeah _,] i _know_ ._ 
B|53| B: _it is [,_ it's] [real] _nice_ . 
A|54| A: [well ,] basically [, yeah] [i] [had] _to do_ [, _that ,] uh , [the_ same] [, uh ,] [for] _about_ _every_ quarter [of the year _.] i mean_ [uh ,] _because_ [i was] [in] [a] , [in] [a] position [of] management [i] [had] responsibilities _over_ [people] _that _, uh ,_ i_ needed [to] make [my] schedule [, uh [,] so] [that] _if [i_ was] [not] [there] [i would] [have] coverage by [some] [other] management personnel ,

B|65| B: [well [,] you know ,] [going] [over] [the] hills [, you know ,] _coming_ _into the_ valley ? 
A|66| A: [oh [,] yeah] ? 
B|67| B: [and] [the] polls [are] open _, what_ [was] [it [,] a] couple [of] weeks [, the] hours [are] _good_ [and] [they're] _even_ open [on] saturdays [and] [a] couple [of] sundays . 
A|68| A: [i] _really , i_ _really_ [like] [the] mercedes . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [and] [other] days _it's just_ _really_ bad _, so [, i_ don't _know] ._ [so] [what] [, what] kinds [of] things [did] [you] experience [in] l [a] [when] [you] were [there] ? _or_ can [you] remember ? were [you] [there] [at] [a] ? 
B|71| B: [you] [just] [say] , [have a] _good_ day [or] whatever . 
A|72| A: [i] [just] [don't know] [and] [now] _they_ [have] _, like_ bins [and] stuff [that] [are] [a] little more convenient _because_ , _mean ,_ until seven o'clock [, you] got [to] _pay_ [to] park [at the] _student_ center [, you] can't _really_ unload [all] _your_ stuff . 
B|73| B: [that's] true . _everyone_ [had] [a] [two] [way] wrist watch [t v] [on] their wrist _, like [,_ uh ,] dick tracy .

B|81| B: [you _know [,] i_ know] we're [not] supposed [to do] [this] long distance [but] [actually] [i'm] _getting_ [a] call [. i] wonder [if i] _could_ possibly [take _it] on_ call waiting . _could_ [i] ask [you] [to] hold [one] minute ? 
A|82| A: [you're] [, uh ,] everybody [i] speak [to] [is] [in] texas [, oh [,] oh [,] yeah [,] but] [i'm] , _i'm in_ new york _and , uh [,_ we] seem [, we] seem [to] [have] [, um [,] _i] think_ [the] _american_ gladiators [is] [on] sunday afternoons [actually] [around] [here] as [well ,] sometimes . 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ 
B|85| B: [well ,] [same] [here] . thanks [for] calling . 
A|86| A: _yes_ supposedly [that's] [what] [it's] suppose [to go] [for] [, [and] [you] know [,] we'll] [just] [have] [to] wait [and] see whether [that's] approved [or] [not .] 
B|87| B: [because] [since] [i'm] [an] international [student] , [they] [want to] send [me] _back_ [to] argentina . 
A|88| A: [is] she [the] oldest [one] ? 
B|89| B: [and then] _three_ [years] later [they're] cured [, and] [let] loose [on] society again . 
A|90| A: [you] can't get [all] [of] us . 
B|91| B: _oh , that's_ _okay_ . 
A|92| A: [did] [you know] [that [,] no _,] really_ [not .] [did] [you know] [that [,] like _,] something_ [like] fifty percent [of the] world's landfills [is] [like] _paper_ ? filled [with] _paper_ . 
B|93| B: [so [,] uh , [i] [mean] ,] he's [from that] old depression era [and , uh [,] you know [,] it's] [, oh [,] [it's] just] blissfull [that] [they're] both , _able_ [to do] [everything] [for] _themselves_ . 
A|94| A: [and it] takes [about] _four_ [to] five cans [to] fill [up a] air conditioning unit [in] [a] car _, and [i_ , i] thought [about] [that [,] and] [my] husband [even] [was] kind [of] woozy after [that] _because i'm_ sure he breathed [it] 
B|95| B: [oh [,] really] . 
A|96| A: [around] [a] thousand . 
B|97| B: [yeah] 
A|98| A: [that's] [right [.] uh-huh] [, yeah [.] i have] [some] friends [that] live [in] westport [and] [it's] _really [,_ really] bad _. i mean_ [you ,] 
B|99| B: [i think] [we] should [just] abandon _the [,_ you know [,] the] written word altogether [, you know .] 
A|100| A: [that] [there's] [no] problem [with] [getting] [them] [to] , [do] stuff . 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [oh , that's] [good] . 
B|103| B: [right .] [there] _has_ [to be] [, uh [,] a] reuse [for] [it [.] i [mean] [,] that's why] [they] recycle . [the] [one] [i think] [is] [the] most interesting [is] [with] [the] recycled bottles [and] [all] [that , uh , the] industry seems [to be] doing [with] [the] recycled polymers [. uh ,] [everything] _from , uh ,_ waste baskets [to] carpet [to] [the] [no] stick [, [i] mean] [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
A|104| A: [yeah [.] uh ,] maybe , maybe too [a] big social change [that's] [, that's] maybe [for the] worst [is [,] uh ,] [is ,] [is] [how] [, um [,] the] people's [, uh ,] views [on] , [on] relationships [has] changed [, you know , and] [now] [we] [have] , [now] [we] [have] [several] [, you know [,] we] [have] [to] worry [about] aids [and] [we] [have] [to] worry [about] [, uh ,] maybe [people] [are] becoming more aware , more , more afraid [of] relationships . 
B|105| B: [you] [want to] [buy] [american] . 
A|106| A: [uh-huh [.] well , i] [still ,] [all] [three] [of] [my] daughters [are] married [, but [,] i don't [know] , i] [just] [still] [have] need [for _the] four_ bedrooms [just] having [company] [from] [time] [to] [time] . [and] [some] [of] [them] [coming] [back] home [and] things [, you know .] 
B|107| B: [oh ,] [exactly] . 
A|108| A: [oh .] 
B|109| B: [um [,] _and i] think_ [we] choose very , very carefully _the [,_ um ,] alternative situations [that [we] had] [them] [in] . 
A|110| A: [yeah [,] my] wife got [them] [from , uh [,] um ,] friend [of] hers [at] [work] [and] [everything] [, you know [,] you know ,] as kittens , 
B|111| B: [but] [i don't] [really , i don't] _ever_ [take] anything . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .] [that's] [right .] [that's] , honestly [right .] 
B|113| B: [i [know] [, i] [,] [you] read] [about it] [in] [the paper ,] [every] day , somebody who's _done_ _this [,_ or] [that [,] something] [really] horrible 
A|114| A: [of] course [, the] chemicals [themselves] [when] [you] [buy] [them] , [they're] expensive too . 
B|115| B: [oh ,] [they] [did] ? 
A|116| A: [oh [,] [i] think] [that's] wonderful . 
B|117| B: [well] [i [have] a] bunch [of] [computer] journals [because [i'm] in] [computer] science 
A|118| A: [okay] , [how do you] [feel] [about] [them] ? 
B|119| B: [yeah [,] and] [i'm] [from utah] [, so [, i] , [i] [like] [,] [the] four] seasons 
A|120| A: [oh ,] [i'm] [so] [sorry] [. but] [that's] [good] [that] [you're] [going] [to] get another [one] . 
B|121| B: [they] devoured [it] [that] quickly . 
A|122| A: [yeah [.] [yeah] .] 
B|123| B: [you] [pay] gasoline taxes [every] [time] [you] pump [something] _into_ [your , your] tank . 
A|124| A: [uh-huh [.] [yeah] .] [um [,] i have] [that] [on] [my] [, uh ,] [computer] [here] [and] also [, um [,] i] [do] [some] [work] [at] u [t] d [and , uh [,] that's] [what] [they] [have] [there] [and [it] was] [just] [so] [nice] [to be] [able] [just] [to] [step] [into the] position [and , and] already [know] [the] [you know ,] already [know] [the , the] software . [and [,] um [,] i don't know] [from] [my] own experience [, um ,] wordperfect [is] [just] [so] much better than , than wordstar [at least] [the] version [of] wordstar [that] [i] [used to] [have] [. it] may [be] improved by [now] [but ,] 
B|125| B: [nice] talking [to] [you] . 
A|126| A: [well [,] [it] is [,] the] hardest [thing] i've [ever] [done] , as much as [you'd] [go] [out]

B|129| B: [yeah .] 
A|130| A: [what do you] [do] ? 
B|131| B: [i] couldn't either . 
A|132| A: [but [, uh [,] i] don't know] [i think] everybody [would] [feel] [it is] [same] [way] [if] [they] were touched by crime [. [i] think] [everyone] [would] [, you] [and i think] [are] honest [and] candid [because] [we] [could] [do] [it on] , [in] [this ,] vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|133| B: [uh-huh .]
