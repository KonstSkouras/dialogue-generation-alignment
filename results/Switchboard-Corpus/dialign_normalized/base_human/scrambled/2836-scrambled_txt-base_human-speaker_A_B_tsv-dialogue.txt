B|15| B: [yeah .] _what do you_ [where] _do you_ [like to] camp ? _how do you_ [like to] camp ? 
A|16| A: [it's] amazing [how] [uh] [how] much [uh] [it] changes [and i] weigh _probably_ _about [the_ same] [i] weighed [for] _oh_ _i don't know how_ many [years but uh] [it's] changed places [and] things _don't_ fit [just] quite _exactly_ fit [the same] . 
B|17| B: [and _it] is_ _i would_ imagine [in] terms [of] [of] size [and so] forth [it's] relatively typical _for the_ area _. it_ _might_ [be] _i would_ [say] [it's] [probably] midsized _for the_ area . _there_ _are_ _some_ smaller [and] _there_ _are _you_ know_ _several_ larger . 
A|18| A: _they_ _don't_ look [a] [thing] [a] [like] 
B|19| B: [i] _feel_ _sorry_ [for] her .

B|21| B: [that's] been 
A|22| A: [and] ours start _at_ _at_ _at_ _at_ eight [and] end _at_ eleven _that's why_ [we] [. _i] [i_ would] _actually_ [like] [it] better _if_ _everything_ started _at_ seven [and] ended _at_ _ten_ . 
B|23| B: _oh ._ 
A|24| A: [you know] [that] [just] _really_ rubbed _me_ [the] wrong _way_ .

B|27| B: [uh] _you know _and_ and_ generally [when] _i was_ growing _up [a_ lot of] those _people_ [the] only _time_ [i] _ever_ saw [them] [was] _at the_ reunion [so] [uh] 
A|28| A: _because_ [all the] models [of] teaching english [are] based _on_ teaching english [to] spanish speakers _or_ [to] [other] european language speakers . [and] [people] _don't_ realize [how] different [some] _of the_ languages _they_ speak [are] . 
B|29| B: _okay_ . 
A|30| A: [and _so] _i_ think_ _um_ [it's] become _real_ important [to] _me_ _that we_ try [to] spend [time] together as [a] family . [so] [there's] _one_ _or_ _two_ nights [a] week [we] _have a_ _on_ monday nights [we] set aside [time] [where] [it's] called [uh] family home evening [and] [we] stay home [that] evening [all] [of] us [and] [we] [do] things together . 
B|31| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|32| A: [you] _think_ _about it_ [and] [it's] _really _i don't_ _know_ ._ _this_ country kind [of] takes [the] worst care _of the_ elderly [of] any [other] country .

B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: _yes ._ 
B|39| B: [oh] [well] [that's] _nice_ . 
A|40| A: [in] [a lot of] [well] especially [in] things [you] pick [up] _the paper_ [and _you] read_ [you know] [you] _think_ [oh] [my] goodness 
B|41| B: [oh] [well] [it's] [not] [that] long ago [. [it] was] [oh] twelve times _of the year ._ 
A|42| A: _they're_ [not] _going_ [to] _take_ [that] money [you] give [them] [and] [go] try [to] figure [out a] _way_ [to] dry [out] _with_ [it .] [now] come _on_ let's [be] realistic

[my] accounting department will [at the] end [of the] month [. _i] think_ [that] _i think_ [that's] [the] _way_ things [work] [in] pennsylvania . [and _i] know_ _they_ [work] [that] _way_ [in] [uh] [say] [here] [in] d _c_ .

B|81| B: [you _know] [i_ know] we're [not] supposed [to do] [this] long distance [but] [actually] [i'm] _getting_ [a] call [. i] wonder [if i] _could_ possibly [take _it] on_ call waiting . _could_ [i] ask [you] [to] hold [one] minute ? 
A|82| A: [you're] [uh] everybody [i] speak [to] [is] [in] texas [oh] [oh] [yeah] [but] [i'm] _i'm in_ new york _and uh_ [we] seem [we] seem [to] [have] [um] _i think_ [the] _american_ gladiators [is] [on] sunday afternoons [actually] [around] [here] as [well] sometimes . 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [uh-huh .] _yes ._ 
B|85| B: [well] [same] [here] . thanks [for] calling . 
A|86| A: _yes_ supposedly [that's] [what] [it's] suppose [to go] [for] [and [you] know] [we'll] [just] [have] [to] wait [and] see whether [that's] approved [or] [not .] 
B|87| B: [because] [since] [i'm] [an] international [student] [they] [want to] send [me] _back_ [to] argentina . 
A|88| A: [is] she [the] oldest [one] ? 
B|89| B: [and then] _three_ [years] later [they're] cured [and] [let] loose [on] society again . 
A|90| A: [you] can't get [all] [of] us . 
B|91| B: _oh that's_ _okay_ . 
A|92| A: [did] [you know] [that] [no] _really_ [not .] [did] [you know] [that] [like] _something_ [like] fifty percent [of the] world's landfills [is] [like] _paper_ ? filled [with] _paper_ . 
B|93| B: [so] [uh [i] mean] he's [from that] old depression era [and uh] [you know] [it's] [oh] [it's just] blissfull [that] [they're] both _able_ [to do] [everything] [for] _themselves_ . 
A|94| A: [and it] takes [about] _four_ [to] five cans [to] fill [up a] air conditioning unit [in] [a] car [and [i] i] thought [about] [that] [and my] husband [even] [was] kind [of] woozy after [that] _because i'm_ sure he breathed [it] 
B|95| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|96| A: [around] [a] thousand . 
B|97| B: [yeah] 
A|98| A: [that's] [right [.] uh-huh] [yeah [.] i have] [some] friends [that] live [in] westport [and] [it's] [really] [really] bad _. i mean_ [you] 
B|99| B: [i think] [we] should [just] abandon _the you _know_ the_ written word altogether [you know .] 
A|100| A: [that] [there's] [no] problem [with] [getting] [them] [to do] stuff . 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [oh that's] [good] . 
B|103| B: [right .] [there] _has_ [to be] [uh] [a] reuse [for] [it [.] i mean] [that's why] [they] recycle . [the] [one] [i think] _is the_ most interesting [is] [with] [the] recycled bottles [and] [all] [that uh the] industry seems [to be] doing [with] [the] recycled polymers [. uh] [everything] _from uh_ waste baskets [to] carpet [to] [the] [no] stick [i mean] [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
A|104| A: [yeah [.] uh] maybe maybe too [a] big social change [that's] [that's] maybe [for the] worst [is] [uh] [is] [is] [how] [um] [the] people's [uh] views [on] [on] relationships [has] changed [you know and] [now] [we] [have] [now] [we] [have] [several] [you know] [we] [have] [to] worry [about] aids [and] [we] [have] [to] worry [about] [uh] maybe [people] [are] becoming more aware more more afraid [of] relationships . 
B|105| B: [you] [want to] [buy] [american] . 
A|106| A: [uh-huh [.] well i] [still] [all] [three] [of] [my] daughters [are] married _but [i don't_ [know] i] [just] [still] [have] need [for _the] four_ bedrooms [just] having [company] [from] [time] [to] [time] . [and] [some] [of] [them] [coming] [back] home [and] things [you know .] 
B|107| B: [oh] [exactly] . 
A|108| A: [oh .] 
B|109| B: [um] _and i think_ [we] choose very very carefully [the] [um] alternative situations [that [we] had] [them] [in] . 
A|110| A: [yeah] [my] wife got [them] [from uh] [um] friend [of] hers [at] [work] [and] [everything] [you know] [you know] as kittens 
B|111| B: [but i don't] [really i don't] _ever_ [take] anything . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .] [that's] [right .] [that's] honestly [right .] 
B|113| B: [i [know] i] [you read] [about it] [in] [the paper] [every] day somebody who's _done_ [this] [or] [that] [something] [really] horrible 
A|114| A: [of] course [the] chemicals [themselves] [when] [you] [buy] [them] [they're] expensive too . 
B|115| B: [oh] [they] [did] ? 
A|116| A: [oh] [i think] [that's] wonderful . 
B|117| B: [well [i] [have] a] bunch [of] [computer] journals [because [i'm] in] [computer] science 
A|118| A: [okay] [how do you] [feel] [about] [them] ? 
B|119| B: [yeah] [and] [i'm] [from utah] [so [i] [i] [like] [the] four] seasons 
A|120| A: [oh] [i'm] [so] [sorry] [. but] [that's] [good] [that] [you're] [going] [to] get another [one] .

[and] [um] [i don't know] [from] [my] own experience [um] wordperfect [is] [just] [so] much better than than wordstar [at least] [the] version [of] wordstar [that] [i] [used to] [have] [. it] may [be] improved by [now] [but] 
B|125| B: [nice] talking [to] [you] . 
A|126| A: [well] [it [is] the] hardest [thing] i've [ever] [done] as much as [you'd] [go] [out]

A|132| A: [but [uh] [i] don't [know] [i] think] everybody [would] [feel] [it is] [same] [way] [if] [they] were touched by crime [. [i] think] [everyone] [would] [you] [and i think] [are] honest [and] candid [because] [we] [could] [do] [it on] [in] [this] vehicle [uh] 
B|133| B: [uh-huh .]
