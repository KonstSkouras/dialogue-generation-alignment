B|35| B: [so] [it's] [got] real [high] ceilings [on] half [the] house [and] [the] other half [is] [just] standard sized ceilings . 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [i] mean [you] honestly [do .] _now_ _i have_ friends _that _i_ love_ [to] death [but] [and _they] have_ children [but] their children _does_ anything [we [have] to] _take them_ [and] [you know] [to do] [it .] 
B|39| B: [well] actually [i] _much_ prefer [a] stick shift [and what] [i'm i'm] curious [. _i] i_ [know] [why] [i love] [a] stick shift . [why] [why] [did you] [want] _one_ ? 
A|40| A: [but] _now_ [you know] [you] wouldn't [probably] [read] [about] [it] _here_ [in] _texas_

A|42| A: _yes_ [and] 
B|43| B: [and] [it] [was] _an_ older _car_

A|50| A: _yeah well_ [you] learned [then] [right] ?

A|52| A: _oh_ [yeah] [they do .] 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: _oh_ [you] [are] ? 
B|55| B: [i think] _so ._ 
A|56| A: _most _of_ the_ time 
B|57| B: [i'm] sure [they] will . 
A|58| A: _okay_ . [uh] [one] _of the_ things [they] talked [about] _was uh_ [did] [we] [what] [do] [we] [think] [about] [a] judge making [the] decision ? 
B|59| B: _right ._ 
A|60| A: all [right .] thank [you] . bye bye . 
B|61| B: [but] [that's] [another] [subject] [but] 
A|62| A: _well i_ [just] [watch] _them ._ 
B|63| B: [yes] [. uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh] _which_ [seems] [so] awful . 
B|65| B: [and] [so] _uh you know_ _at_ _work_ [a] lot _of people_ _are [you_ know] [i think] [well] [this] [is] [not a] normal situation anymore [in] our [in] our world [we] live [in] . [most _of] them_ [uh] continue [to] _work_ [if] [they have] [have] kids . 
A|66| A: [uh-huh [.] uh-huh _.] yeah_ [or] _maybe_ offer [them] [you know] some [sort of] [an] incentive [to do] [it .] [uh you know] college credit [you know] [something] [you know] 
B|67| B: [uh] other than [that] [it] [was] [a] _at_ [best] . 
A|68| A: [it's] _kind of_ hard [to] keep [on] [about] [the] weather _for_ five minutes 
B|69| B: [it] [was [uh] you know] [it's] easier [to] join [them] than fight [them .] 
A|70| A: [that's] [right .] 
B|71| B: [oh .] 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [yeah] [right .] 
A|74| A: [oh .] 
B|75| B: [oh .] 
A|76| A: [oh] [i] see [. uh-huh .] [well] [very] good [i think] we've [probably] [know] [know] [each] other's exercise habits 
B|77| B: _um_ as far as [the] new hires _i i_ hired [on] [just] early [enough] [that _i] i_ missed [it .] _um_ _where_ [the] new hires were concerned _but uh_ [not] nobody [no [i] don't] [think] anybody questions [that] _um_ testing someone as [a] as [a] precondition [to] being hired [but] _um_ _for the_ conditions _that for_ our employment [to] change while [you're] [on] [the] job [that's] _i i don't know_ [that] [that's] _where_ [i think] [that] [most] _people_ get upset . [it's [uh] you know] [it] [it's] changing [the] rules _in the_ middle [of the] game basically [and uh] [it's] [just] [it] [it's] [a] [really] tough question 
A|78| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: golly . 
A|80| A: [and] [i [don't] have] [that] [in] _my_ current operation [but [uh] you] mentioned [uh] flexible [work] schedule [and] [that's] [that's] good . 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [yeah] [in] [yeah] [it's] [really] different _because_ [that's] [kind [of] the] [you know] [that's] [the] chalk hills down _there_ limestone hills 
A|84| A: [oh] _i like_ _that too_ . [but uh] [in] fact [i] didn't eat [out] [that much] [there] [because] _i was_ traveling by myself [in] [a] [car] [it] would [have] [been] [i think] _much more_ fun [to do] [it] [like] [in the] van [with] [a bunch [of] people] . 
B|85| B: [yeah .] 
A|86| A: how [do you] dress [for] [work] ? 
B|87| B: [and uh] [i'm] building [a] [a] log house _at_ [a] farm [that [i] have] [in] east [texas] [which] _is a_ hundred miles from [here] . 
A|88| A: [i] 
B|89| B: [uh] [i] [take] [my] boys [well i] took [them] _up_ until [this] _year_ they're grown [and] gone from home [now] 
A|90| A: [no [no] [i] think] [the] [um] _sometimes_ _i guess_ [what] [did] [i] [read] [recently] [the] [um] [the] [uh] christian [uh] point [is is] always [the] point [of] [well it's] [at] conception [but] [then] [um] [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception [is a] biblical term . [and] there's [no] concept [of] conception [in] medicine [or] biology . 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [but] she [got] credits [for] [it] ? 
B|93| B: [no .] 
A|94| A: haven't [been] doing [much] [of [that] [for] the] last [year] [or] [so [.] so] [i i don't know] [where] those guys [are] [at] these days . [but] [i] 
B|95| B: [and uh] [i was] brought _up_ [the] same [way] [it] doesn't [matter] [what] age [you] [have] [just] [so] long as [you] can get _up to_ _go_ [to] class [the] next morning [you] can stay _up_ [you know] 
A|96| A: [yeah] _he_ [i] asked [the] vet [why] _he_ [did] [that] [and] _he_ [said] _he_ [was] [probably] weaned _too_ young [which] _he_ [was] [because] his mom [was] killed [so .] 
B|97| B: [it] [really] [does] _and and_ [i've] seen [the] same thing [that] [you're] [talking] [about] [uh] [much more] crime than ever _before_ . drugs [of] course [uh] [a] big _part of_ [it] [i think] . 
A|98| A: [we have] _family_ [that] lives outside [of the] state [so we] [go] visit both sets [of] grandparents [and and] [take] [car] trips . 
B|99| B: [right [.] yeah] 
A|100| A: all [right .] [i've] never done [it] [before] [so] _i guess_ [that's] all [i [have] [to] do] [right] 
B|101| B: [you know] [i like] [what] [he] says [and] he'll [be] [so] far [off] [the] wall [that] they'll elect him . 
A|102| A: [i] mean supposing [i] come [up to] [you] [and] [i] [just] point blank kill [you] . 
B|103| B: [yeah .] 
A|104| A: [i think] some [of them] would rather [be] [in] jail 
B|105| B: [it] [is] . [have] [you] [been] living [there] [very] long ? 
A|106| A: [yeah .] 
B|107| B: [no .] 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [i guess] [it's] [just] [that] [maybe] [people] _are [you_ know] upset [at] court [you know] . [if] [it] [was] [if] [it] [was] [a] [a] [family] member [of] theirs though [that] [was] innocent [and] [then] they'd [want] [to] [be] [on] [that] jury . 
A|110| A: [what] [part [of] [the] country] [are you] [in] ? 
B|111| B: [that's] [okay] [um] [i've i've] thought [about] [that too] [and] [um] [when] [we] [take] our vacations [we] [we] [do] [take them] [in] august [sometimes] [so] [that] [we] can [be] [away] from [here]
