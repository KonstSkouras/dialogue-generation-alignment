A|28| A: [yeah] _well_ _you can_ possess 'em here [too] [but] _they [have_ _to] be_ they're registered [and] [uh ,] [like] [uh] [the] [the] brady bill [that's] currently being discussed nationally [and] whatever [is] [very] _well_ supported here [, in] gun control avenues , 
B|29| B: [oh ,] gee . 
A|30| A: [yeah .] [we] tried [to] find _them_ _last year_ , [we] screwed [around] [and] waited [too] long [and i] couldn't find [a] nursery [that] _had_ any _of them_ left . 
B|31| B: [you know] [like] _people that_ _are_ [in] prison [, i] mean [we] _didn't_ _put_ [them] [there] _. they_ _put_ themselves [in] [that] situation . 
A|32| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|33| B: [and , and] who's [, you know _,] the_ tuna [is] radioactive _to a_ certain extent . 
A|34| A: [but] [what] _, i think_ [that] [was] _a , _a_ , a_ setback . [that they [,] i] [don't] [know [,] they] [went] [, i] [don't] [know ,] how _many_ miles an hour [. _i] think_ [like] 
B|35| B: [and] especially _in the_ winter [. i] mean [, _you] get_ _up_ _in the_ dark [and] come _home_ _in the_ dark [you _know] _._ it's_ [like] _, it's_ [like] [a] vampire _sometimes_ 
A|36| A: yes [, i] live [in] northwest garland _. right_ [up] [there] [near the] golf [course] . 
B|37| B: [yeah .] 
A|38| A: _well [,_ the] _only_ [, uh ,] references [that] [i] [have] seen lately _has been_ [, uh _,] in ,_ part [of the] overmilitarization [of] iraq [was] due [to] companies selling [them] arms [and] _things_ [, [and] , and] [they] made references [to] [in the] past , how _we have_ given arms _to , uh ,_ nicaragua [and] [to] other places [in] latin america [, and] [that] those might turn [around] [and] haunt us someday . 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: _but [,_ uh [,] if] everyone [would] take [it [,] i think] [if] everyone took [it] seriously 
A|42| A: [uh ,] _as_ [a] [course] [for] p e [you know] [so] [i] could graduate . 
B|43| B: [yeah _,] there_ _are_ _. _um_ [,_ i'm] living _in a_ dorm [right] [now] [, and] [so] [right] downstairs _there's a_ facility [. [and] i] _really_ feel _kind of_ guilty [for] [not] working [out] [more] _than_ _i do_ [because] _there's a_ facility [right] downstairs [where] _all_ [, you know ,] _all_ [we [have] _to] _do_ _is_ _,_ is [,_ uh ,] run _down_ [there] 
A|44| A: _okay ._ [what] [, uh ,] [go] ahead [and] tell _me_ about _your_ [home] 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [really] ? _well _,_ that's_ [a] [good] deal . 
B|47| B: [i] sort [of] worked half [time [.] i] [had] [very] flexible _hours_ [. i] nursed _all_ three [of] [our] children until [they] _were_ [at] least [a] [year] [and [i] [,] [you] can] _do_ [that] despite working [very] easily [which] [is] one [of the] [things] [i] preach _all the_ [time] [to _,] to_ mothers . 
A|48| A: [that's] [a] [good] idea . [we] ought [to [,] [yeah] [,] and] _maybe_ _when_ [the] other brothers [and] sisters retire [or] whatever [, i] [don't] _know what_ they're _going [to_ do] [. it's] [really] [not] _my_ family [. it's] _my_ fiancee's [so] [i] [don't] [, _i] can't_ [say] much . 
B|49| B: [right] , he's supposed [to be] able [to do] [that .] 
A|50| A: [and] [there's] almost [no] energy , [there's] [very] [little] energy value [in] actually doing [a lot of the] recycling [, but] [there] _is [a_ lot of] energy [in] [it] [if [you] can] burn [it] [and] use [it ,] produce electricity . 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: [yeah . [yeah] [.] um] . _well_ _i'll_ tell [you] . [sometimes] [it's _, it's] pretty_ bad here . [like] today _i think [it_ was] [pretty] bad [. i] [don't] [know] [if] [it was] [, if] [it's] [just] _, uh , the_ allergies [or] [what] [but] [some] days [it's] [very] [nice] here downtown 
B|53| B: although they've _got_ [, uh ,] meals [on] wheels [, which] [i] _understand_ [is a] [really] [good] [, you know ,] _way_ [to] handle [that so] [that] [at] least [they] eat . 
A|54| A: [uh , uh ,] university [of] southern mississippi . 
B|55| B: [well [,] they] _did_ [have a] fairly decent [year] finally [this] [year] . 
A|56| A: [it's] [not] unique , 
B|57| B: [you know ,] once _they , [they_ have] [been] arrested [and] [if] [they] [know] beyond [a] shadow [of a] doubt , _these people_ _are_ guilty . 
A|58| A: _oh ._ [well [,] i] tell [you] [this] [, the] weather here [and] [there's] [no] mountains [or anything] [, you know [,] and] _when_ [you] [go] [to a] football game [in] colorado [that's] [, you know ,] [there's] snow [and] [it's] an adventure [and] here [, yeah] you've [just] [got] [to] drive [down] [to] _the [,_ to] [the] stadium 
B|59| B: [and i] [was] disappointed [when] [i] _went to_ texas [. _i] didn't_ _see_ [that] [many] [of _them] ._ 
A|60| A: [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [yeah .] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [but] [by] [the] [time] _you get_ [done] [you] feeling [really] terrific . 
A|66| A: [and ,] [um _,] my_ husband [is a] ham radio operator [and [i] think] about [all [the] [people] that] [he] talks [to] [all] over _the ,_ 
B|67| B: [oh .] 
A|68| A: isn't [that] correct . 
B|69| B: [a] lexus [, uh ,] s c three hundred [maybe] . _something_ [on] [that] order . 
A|70| A: haven't [been] [there] [, i] keep hearing [these] marvelous [things] about deer valley [and ,] 
B|71| B: [so [,] my] [only] experience [has been] _from the_ point [of] view [of a] consumer [. uh [,] _but] [,_ if] [that's the] case [, _if] the_ _business_ [is] responsible [for] policing themselves _, then [i_ think] [some] [well] defined mechanisms need [to be] [in] [place] [so] _that [,_ uh , the] opportunity [to] forget [that you] owe sales tax [for] _something_ [, uh [,] can] [be] avoided . 
A|72| A: [and , and] [we] [really] [don't have] any [that] [don't have] [the] social security [and] [everything] [really] isn't [that] much [for] elderly [people to] live [on] . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [yeah [,] can] [you] believe [it _,] that's_ [just] [, uh ,] 
B|75| B: [yeah [,] uh ,] _are_ [you] [going [to] , uh ,] _put_ [your] son [in] child care _in [a_ , a] [year] [or] _two_ ? 
A|76| A: [yeah . [yeah] .] 
B|77| B: _i would_ imagine [that] [i'll] [, uh [,] if] _something_ happens _, i'll_ move one [of them] [or] [you know [,] in [,] in] [with] [me] . 
A|78| A: [i didn't] [know .] 
B|79| B: [i can't] remember [which] [. i] [was] [on] [a] jury trial [last year] [only] [i] [got] kicked [out] [as] [, uh , [the] last] selection [that] [the [,] uh ,] [defense] [got] . 
A|80| A: [you know ,] i've heard , [we [have] [a] couple of] friends [that] goes [to] washington quite often [, and] [that] _must be_ [the] thing [. they] [really] hadn't [either] [. they] [went to] [the] memorial [, you know ,] [when] [they] [go] [, it's] [on] [business] 
B|81| B: [they] _are_ beautiful homes . 
A|82| A: [so [,] [yeah] _,] that's_ why _, that's_ why england [was] [nice .] even , [we] traveled [in] europe [for] about [a] week [, and] [that] [was] even [nice] [because] [there] wasn't [, uh , [the] ,] most [the] places [we] [went] , [we] [went to] germany [and] switzerland [and ,] 
B|83| B: [yeah ,] it'll [be] hard [to] _get_ [people to] give [up] _their_ mobility . 
A|84| A: [and] [they] came [from the] same litter [and] [everything] . 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .]

[so ,] [we] [kind of] [did] [a little bit] [of] hiking , sure [, and] [a little bit] [of] [, uh ,] sightseeing [, uh ,] different areas [. uh ,] sitting back [at] different areas [and] spending [hours] , [we] never [had] [really] [a] [time] limit , [we just] [kind of] [did] [what] [we] wanted [to do] [for] [that] day . 
B|87| B: [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [um [,] but] [there] [is] starting [to [,] in] minneapolis itself , [because] [of] [so] [many] [people] [on] [the] highway [, there] [is] becoming [a] problem [of] pollution [, and] [they] [just] [put] [in a] strict law [that] [as] [of] _every_ [year] [when] [you get] [your] license tabs [you] [have to] [have] [your] car inspected [to see] [if] [it's] releasing any [, uh ,] lead into [the] air [or] other pollutants , 
B|89| B: [yeah .]

[and] , and] [some of the] communities [that] [do] [, the] residents [are] having [to] pay [to] participate [in] [it .] [which] [really] [doesn't] make sense . 
B|99| B: [yeah .] 
A|100| A: [yeah .] 
B|101| B: [yeah [.] [no] [,] that's] true . [course] [they [have] a] requirement [that [,] uh [,] that] [every] single appeal [must be] permitted .
