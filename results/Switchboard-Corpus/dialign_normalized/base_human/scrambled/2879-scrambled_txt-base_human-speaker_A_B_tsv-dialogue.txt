A|26| A: _well , i_ tell [you] [i , _i] just_ read _an_ article _in the_ paper [about] _what_ [they] _are_ doing [, _i] think_ [it _was] an_ ad [in [,] in] our publication _at_ texas instruments , [where] [they] _are_ breaking [the] jaw [and _,] and_ lining [the] jaw [up] _with_ [the] teeth . 
B|27| B: [i think] [i think] [we're] _going to_ talk [about] parents spending _time_ [with] _their_ [children] _. we ,_ [have] _three_ [children] who [are] eleven , nine [, and] [eight] . 
A|28| A: [uh-huh] _, uh-huh _._ well_ [we] [have] cable _, but_ [we] only [have] cinemax [, and] [uh , [i] think] our favorite night [is [,] uh ,] monday night , 
B|29| B: g m [, uh ,] chrysler announced [that] _they're_ _going to_ _, they're_ [, well] [they] _actually_ [have] [an] electric minivan . [yeah .] _their_ , _their_ caravan [. but] [it] costs [, uh ,] fifty thousand [dollars] _right [now_ .] 
A|30| A: usually [it's ,] one other couple come over _for a_ dinner . 
B|31| B: [yeah .] 
A|32| A: _so [, uh [,_ i] ,] 
B|33| B: _and _, uh_ [._ the] thing [about] _it [,_ you know [,] now] [that] i've found , [is] [that] [we] _get_ such good coverage [on] _t v_ _, or_ [at] least such _, _i don't know_ ,_ attempted thoroughness [of] coverage , _by_ [the] _time_ [you] _get_ [the] _time_ magazine , there's nothing [in] [it] _you don't [know_ .] 
A|34| A: [and [,] i don't know] _if_ _there_ [was] [something] wrong [with] [it [,] or] [it ,] _his_ directions weren't quite fully instructed onto _that ,_ 
B|35| B: yes [, it] [would] almost [have _to] be_ [, i] suppose . _if _you_ ,_ _if you_ _had_ [to] chose [, i guess] [i] [would] [, i] am _sure_ [i] [would] take [the] lethal injection . 
A|36| A: [oh] . 
B|37| B: [and] [that's] [really] [a] terrific feeling [, because] [you] [just] [go] [there] [at] [the] end [of the] day [, _and] you_ figure , god _, i'm_ ready [for] bed _and you_ exercise [and] [then] [, it's] sort [of] painful [for a] while , 
A|38| A: _and [, uh ,_ i] enjoy [them] coming _, but_ [for] short doses 
B|39| B: [yeah [.] well] [that's] _big_ [up] [here] [because] [of the] [, they] grow [a lot of] corn 
A|40| A: [that's right] [and ,] 
B|41| B: [but ,] [when] , during [the] winter _time_ [i think] [they [,] they] move south _or something_ 
A|42| A: [it was] [nice] talking [to] [you] too . bye-bye . 
B|43| B: [and] [it] weighs twenty pounds [or] , _something like that_ . 
A|44| A: [oh ,] okay . 
B|45| B: [well] [you] lived [in] france , 
A|46| A: [they] became [a] _very_ successful immigrant group [. [but] _,] and _,_ but_ _a lot of people_ coming over _from_ vietnam , [right _now] ,_ coming _from_ worn torn countries , [are] , [are] _not_ having _the same_ success [. [i] think] some _people have_ [just] assumed [, well ,] why , why [can't] [you] [be] successful ? [the] japanese [were [,] or] [the] chinese [were [,] [or] something] [. and] [it's] [really] much _more_ complicated . 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: okay , okay _. because [i_ , i] [had] [done] capital packages [for] two eighty-sixes [and] [three] eighty-sixes _, but i_ didn't [know] [they] [had a] _four_ eighty-six [just] yet . 
B|49| B: [and _,] you know , people_ [say [,] you know , it's] expensive [to] [think] [it's] college _, but ,_ [if] , [if] everybody [would] [be] _a little_ _bit_ responsible [, you know , it's] [like] , [what] does [it ,] [what] does [it] cost . [it] costs five hundred [dollars] [a] semester suppose . [now] [they] [go] [to] [a] state college [and they] live [at] [home] [you know ,] 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [that] [was] _kind of a_ funny song [but] [they] [sure] _do [,_ it] seems [to] _me_ [like] [they] [really] love [their] cowboys _here ._ [even] _when they_ [were] losing pitifully [, you know , people] still support [them [.] we] _drive_ [by] some houses everyday [that have] [big] signs [, we] love [the] 
B|53| B: [so] [what] [do you think] [about] [, uh ,] recycling programs [in] atlanta , julie ? 
A|54| A: [well ,] _not_ [really] . [it's [,] uh [,] it's] [on] [the] _side of a_ hill . 
B|55| B: [or] [, you know _,] they're_ both [just] as bad [, and] i'll [say [,] well , _i] know_ [what] [this] _guy_ stands [for] as _far_ as [for] [his] party [, and , [um ,] but] [yeah .] [you know [,] that's] [not] [the] best way [but ,] 
A|56| A: [oh [,] [i] think] [it] [is] . 
B|57| B: lord . 
A|58| A: [oh] . 
B|59| B: [it was] real [nice] . 
A|60| A: [that's] cool . 
B|61| B: [yeah ,] _if _you_ can_ afford [that] [kind of a] toy , [then] [, i guess] [, uh] 
A|62| A: [um [,] i] [had] [them] delayed [because] [i'm] back [in] graduate [school and] [on] [that] form [it] [says] [if] your joining [the] peace corps [you can] [have] [them] delayed 
B|63| B: [i think] _i know_ [what] you're [is] [it] [like] [a] hand held ? 
A|64| A: [yeah] [sure] 
B|65| B: _he_ [was an] , [an] assistant district attorney [in] chicago [at [,] uh [,] and] while _he_ [was] _writing_ [the] book [, [and ,] uh [,] my] sister-in-law [lives] [in] chicago [, and] she [had] , before [it] _actually_ _got_ [big] , she sent [me] [this] book saying [, you] might [like] [this] [, this] _guy_ [is [,] you know ,] [from] [here .] 
A|66| A: [my] word . 
B|67| B: [and , uh [,] or] [they] fool [the] , [the] defense [in] thinking [that] _they're_ [, you know [,] because] [when they] [go] through those processes [they] [kind of] pick _out_ who [they] want . 
A|68| A: _of course [,_ _you] got_ [a little] [different] direction [going] [, _but [,] uh_ .] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: _on a_ b c ? 
B|71| B: [i think] maybe [more] [information] should [be] given _out_ [about] [it .] 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| B: [oh ,] [how] neat . 
A|74| A: [and] [we're] finding [that] crime [is] [going] [up] _very_ quickly [and] [has] become [a] major problem [, uh ,] [even] [a] [more] major problem . [uh [,] in] dallas , some [of the] major problems [, uh ,] drugs seems [to be] related [to] quite [a] [bit] [of the] crime [we] [have] [now .] [there] _is [a_ lot of] theft _, a lot of_ assault dealing [with] [, uh [,] people] trying [to] [get] money [for] drugs . 
B|75| B: [so] [when] [i] [drive] [the] car [in the] [, [in] the] driveway [in the] afternoon [, [it] [,] it] will [just] [drive] [it] [up] [on a] ramp [that] _actually_ puts [me] [on] top [of the] , [the] [, uh ,] pressure [side of a] [, uh ,] hydraulic cylinder . 
A|76| A: [have] [they] [done] [that] [in] garland ? 
B|77| B: [so _,] [of course_ ,] [the] , [the] attorneys , 
A|78| A: [different] places _every_ year [. we ,] 
B|79| B: [but ,] 
A|80| A: [i mean] [if you] murder [a] [guy] [because] [he] murdered your partner [or [something] like _that] [,_ [i] mean] [pretty] soon [you] run [out _of] people_ [to] murder . 
B|81| B: [right [,] uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [they] [don't know] [that [i] don't] use drugs _. they just_ [tested] [me] once . 
B|83| B: [but , uh _,] i'm_ [sure] [people] [in [,] uh [,] you know [,] [in] [,] uh ,] galveston [and so] forth [would] [be] knowledgeable [about] [it [,] uh ,] pensacola [is a] navy town . 
A|84| A: [yeah] [i don't know [,] uh [, i] guess] [it] [just] depends [on] [how] [they] manage [it .] 
B|85| B: [right .] [so , uh [,] but [i] , i] feel [that [,] uh [,] [a lot of] [people] have] gotten lazy [about] voting . 
A|86| A: [yeah [,] _uh ,] uh ,_ isn't [that] weird ? 
B|87| B: [uh] [uh , uh ,] although [i] [do [,] uh [,] a lot of] , 
A|88| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: [i don't know] [what] [it was] [, we] [had a] real rainy spring 
A|90| A: [no] earthly idea . 
B|91| B: [right .] 
A|92| A: [well] [it [,] i [, _i] agree] with_ [you] [there] _because i know_ _every_ [time] [that] [something] comes into vogue all [the] money goes [to] [that] one [and [you] don't know] whether [it's] still also [going to] [the] other [or] [if] [it's a] limited pie .

B|97| B: there's nothing [like] [them [.] they just] [don't have] [the same] [ones] [in the] supermarket 
A|98| A: [um [,] now] [i'm] , [actually] [i'm] [, i'm] [not] working anymore . [i'm] [a] student [, i'm] [a] graduate student [so] [i'm] doing [a lot of] [writing] [but , uh [,] now] all [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|99| B: [now [,] it was] [very] nicely [done] . 
A|100| A: okay . 
B|101| B: [what] [have] [you got] growing [right now] ? 
A|102| A: [how] [far] [out] [from] [the] city [, [i] mean ,] [do [you] ,] 
B|103| B: [really] ? 
A|104| A: [we're] _probably_ [about] _an hour_ away [from] sharon . 
B|105| B: [certainly] . 
A|106| A: [oh ,] [so ,] [so] [you] [go] back [and] visit [with] [her] anyway . [would] [you] [not] ? 
B|107| B: [right [.] [i] agree with] [that] [. [because i] know] personally myself , i've [been _in] the same_ job [for] [three] years [, it] will [be] [three] years [in] august [and] i've already [been] drug [tested] [three] times . 
A|108| A: [yeah [,] this] [is] _probably_ unusual topic [to] give two [of] us [in the same] city . 
B|109| B: [and] [he] [had] [it] [for] [about] [three] [or] [four] years [where] [we] [just] [about] [had] [to] lift him [and] [carry] him [every] place [he] went . 
A|110| A: [yeah , i] liked your idea too , [there] . 
B|111| B: [yeah .] 
A|112| A: [uh ,] [so [,] i guess] [we] [do] [get] [it] [from] [people] too . [oh [,] you] mentioned c n n [, of course] [i] mentioned radio [and] [the] c n n [t v] news [, you know] ?
