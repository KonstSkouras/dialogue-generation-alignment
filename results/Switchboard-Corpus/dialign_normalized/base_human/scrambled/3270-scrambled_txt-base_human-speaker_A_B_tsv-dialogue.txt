A|16| A: yes yes . 
B|17| B: some baby-sitting groups [again _i] know [it_ sounds] [like] [a] rationalization [but i] [really] [do] [think] [sometimes] [they] [very] early on are [around] lots [of] _other_ children [and] [they] [they] learn [to] share _. they_ learn [not] necessarily [to] [be] [the] _center_ [of] attention [but] [that] at [the] same [time] [we] _have to_ [be] sure [they] are secure . 
A|18| A: [yeah .] 
B|19| B: [and] [we] _had_ [it] perfumed 
A|20| A: [huh .] 
B|21| B: [yeah .] he's about [a] year [and] [a] half younger . 
A|22| A: [so] 
B|23| B: [it] _was_ [uh] [that] _was_ [the] _one_ [that] _was_ used [so much in the] campaign . [in the] [in the] presidential race [. uh] may [it] may [not] [have] been maryland [. it] may [have] been massachusetts [i don't] remember . 
A|24| A: [i] thought she _was a_ prisoner [of] war [or] something [for] [like] ten _years_ . 
B|25| B: [and] [but] oh they're [so much] fun [to] watch _them_ play . 
A|26| A: [he] [never] meows [he] [he] doesn't [have] any front claws _i had_ him declawed 
B|27| B: oh [that's] neat . sure . 
A|28| A: hi . 
B|29| B: [well] [they] are [they] are [the] ultimate dog [to] [have] [around] kids [so] long [as] _your_ kid [is] [not] scared [of] [a] big dog [because] [i had] [a] retriever actually [i had] [a] retriever irish setter cross . which [is] [a] [really] [nice] animal 
A|30| A: [i've] tried [to] [do] [is] [get] _this_ outfit [to] give me [one] 
B|31| B: [yeah .] [but] 
A|32| A: _okay ._ 
B|33| B: [and] [if] [they] were [in the] same building _then_ [you] are going [to] [the] same place 
A|34| A: _and uh_ see [the] [the] [the] state _has_ [a] law [that] says [you] cannot borrow [the] money [to] build [your] own home . 
B|35| B: [and] [they] haven't been doing [too] hot [so] . 
A|36| A: _and i_ wish [that] our recycling [center] took paper bags [. they] won't take those . [we] [like] [to] put our just put our newspapers [in] [a] paper bag _you know_ [and] [then] carry [them] _up_ there [that] way . 
B|37| B: [we] [have] [uh] [uh] tortoise which [is] [a] black [and and] orange . 
A|38| A: [right] . 
B|39| B: _you have_ [more] [of] [a] choice you're [not] pressed upon [as] bad . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [and] [he] likes [to] rebuild cars [and] redo engines [and] [so] [he] [has] _all_ [the] work space [he] needs . 
A|42| A: [well] [i] [i don't] [think] [that] it's it's wrong [for] [a] company [to] require drug testing [for] certain types [of] positions . [for] instance jobs [that] require use [of] heavy machinery [and] things [like] [that] where there's where there's [uh] endangerment [to] their own life [and] [other] people's lives . 
B|43| B: [but] um he's [not] old enough yet [to] [get] into [the] band yet . 
A|44| A: imagine [the] guilt [that] person would [have] . [i] mean burned out . 
B|45| B: [we] did [i] did horseback riding [too] [in] fact when my children were growing [up] [we] always [had] horses [and uh] [that] [was] [kind of] [for] [them] [but] [they] weren't [as] interested [in] [it] [as] [we] were [you know] [so uh] [that] [was a] _real_ i'd [say] probably [for] maybe fifteen [years] [we] dabbled [in] [that] [you know] [we] always [had] horses [around [and] i] [really] enjoyed [that] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] [i know it] [i know it] . 
B|47| B: [okay .] 
A|48| A: [okay] [have a] good night . [all] [right] bye-bye . 
B|49| B: [so] [i've] always [had] [this] problem [with] consumer reports [that] [in the] areas [that] [i know] [a lot] about [i] disagree [with] [them] . 
A|50| A: [yeah] [you] [really] [don't] . [yeah] [the] [you [have] to] look [real] hard [to] see [a lot] [of] things besides concrete [uh]
