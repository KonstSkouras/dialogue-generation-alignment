B|31| B: [yeah .] 
A|32| A: [uh-huh ,] _well_ [you] ,

B|35| B: [but , uh ,] dan reeves _is a_ pretty neat guy anyway . 
A|36| A: [uh [,] you] _get_ [a] few [of] [them] [that] _are _a_ little bit_ sloppier [, uh _,] just_ taking [, uh [,] you know _,] just_ junk items [that] _they_ _, they_ _can_ [just] _get [,_ you know _,] ten_ [to] twenty bucks [for] _real_ quick . 
B|37| B: _oh , i_ didn't [, i] didn't _quite_ hear [all of] [it] . 
A|38| A: _and , uh ,_ [not] necessarily [, you know ,] give [in] [to] [their] [, uh ,] human rights desires [. you know ,] if _they're_ overcrowded _, just_ keep cramming [them] [in] _there_ till _they_ [just] suffocate . [uh ,] 
B|39| B: [i think] [so] too . i'm [in texas] 
A|40| A: [and i] _really_ believe [that] if you're [going to] cut down [on] yourself [, you] need [to] cut down somewhat [on] [your] friends . 
B|41| B: [yeah [,] just] [a little bit] 
A|42| A: [yeah [,] i think] , um , [this [is] a] tough subject _because_ [, uh ,] when [you] _come_ _from_ _two_ different parts _of the_ country _, uh , the_ political views [are] _really_ different [. i _,] uh , [i_ , i] guess _i've_ [had] [to] discuss [a] number [of] [what] might be considered controversial issues , 
B|43| B: [and [, uh ,] uh ,] [also] [that [,] [that] _,] it [,_ my] subconscious [is working on] _things_ while i'm [working] [and [i] , i] go [back] [and] [i've] got new ideas [, but] still . 
A|44| A: [so] _we_ [had] [to] , _we_ [had] [to] give him [a] tomato , tomato juice bath [, [and] , uh ,] _get_ him cleaned up , 
B|45| B: [they] _kind of_ guided [you] . 
A|46| A: [uh ,] when [i] went [to] school [, i] [know] _i was_ scared [to] death [about] being disciplined , 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: _they're_ [about ,] [oh , i] guess _, a_ third [the] size [of] [your] , palm [of] [your] hand 
B|49| B: [right .] [well [,] the] reason why [we] play [over] [there] [is] [because] its _where [,_ since] [we] [are a] garland resident [, they] gave us [a] special deal _where_ [you] [can] [get [,] uh [,] ten] rounds [of] golf [for] [a] [hundred] [dollars] , [yeah [,] a] [hundred] [dollars] cause [it] [is] half [price] [what] [the] normal green fees [are] . 
A|50| A: [and [,] and] _so [,_ it] _was_ [, it] _was_ [a] [much] _more_ intense book than [the] sort [of] flimflam [that] [they] cast off [in the] movie 
B|51| B: _no , i_ did [not] [. i ,] 
A|52| A: [well ,] [what] [i] believe [is] one _of the_ major [uh ,] [things] [that] [is] wrong [with] our public school [system] [is] [that ,] um , [we] _do_ [not] [have] enough discipline 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [no ,] [no , i] haven't . 
B|55| B: [like] [you] take asian countries _, or_ [, uh , the] eastern countries _where_ women [are] [like] [in the] foreground [, uh [,] [in] the] background [and] [the] [men] [are] [in the] foreground , 
A|56| A: [that] [don't] [, it [,] it [,] it] seems _like _, i_ mean ,_ if wrestling [is] prime time , professional wrestling [, it] seems [like] [it's] [just] [, just] [, just] [like] pros [in] [a] wrestling [to] [me] [, i don't] [, i don't] see any difference though , 
B|57| B: _uh-huh , uh-huh ._ 
A|58| A: _and they_ [don't] look at [it] [so] [much] [as [,] you know ,] 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [yeah [,] that] [would] be [nice] [. i] [had] _a friend_ _from_ [there] . 
B|61| B: [uh [,] they] can't use [, [like] , i] _have [a_ friend] [that's] [in the] air conditioning heating business 
A|62| A: huh . [no] 
B|63| B: bye-bye . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [it] wasn't [that] _long_ [that [i] was] [that] young . 
A|66| A: [what] [, uh] [what] _do_ [you] feel [are] important [to] [you] [or] other [people] [as ,] [as] crucial benefits ? 
B|67| B: bye . 
A|68| A: [uh-huh , uh-huh .] _they do_ list , um [, you know ,] list [the] fat , 
B|69| B: [so ,] 
A|70| A: [right .] [right .] um 
B|71| B: [and all of the] descendants [of the] civil _war_ [, i mean ,] [yeah [,] the] civil _war_ veterans [come] together [, [and] they] [come] _as far_ away [from] california [, and] _there's_ usually [oh ,] between [a] [hundred] [and] fifty [and] [two] [hundred] [and] fifty [people] . 
A|72| A: [i] see . 
B|73| B: [this is] what's [going to] happen . 
A|74| A: [yeah ,] [with] [with] [the] great needs [that] [we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and , uh [,] you know [,] the] [, the] problems [we] [have] [with] aids [and] cancer [and [,] and] [how] [come] everybody [is a] lawyer [, you know [,] you know] 
B|75| B: [oh ,] wow . 
A|76| A: okay , [well ,] [there's] [, uh [,] it's] [kind of] an interesting topic [and] one [that [i] think] [is] [quite] fascinating [because] [, uh ,] couple [of] years ago [, i] guess [, uh ,] [not] very , [not] very [long] ago , seemed [like] [the] whole world , [not] [just] [the] united states [, but] [the] whole world [was] [kind of] [in] [a] standstill [where] everyone [was] basically [in] [, uh [,] you _know ,] a_ very comfortable position , [so] [to] say , even though [the] [, the] cold [war] [was] , [was] [in] full swing [. you know [,] you] [had] [the] [, the] russians against [the] americans [, the] communists against [the] free world [, and] [in the] last couple [of] years [things] [have] changed dramatically , [not] only [on the] political front [but] [also] [on the] economic front , [where [,] uh ,] couple [of] years ago [we] [had] [, uh ,] america [was] one [of the] leading powers [and] one [of the] strongest nations [in the] world [as far] [as] economics were concerned [, and] now we're having [a] very tough time [in] [a] recessionary period . we're [also] [have a] very humongous trade deficit [, [and] , uh [,] and] [that's] [kind of] frightening . [also] [, you _know ,] a_ couple [of] years ago [, ten] , fifteen [, ten] , fifteen years ago , an individual [going] [into] [a] career could expect [to] [have] [that] career basically throughout [their] whole life [, and] thirty years ago [, that] [was] [, that] [was] basically [it ,] whereas now we're expected [to] [have a] career change every [, you know ,] every couple [of] years [and] possibly [four] [to] five career changes throughout our lifetime [, and] [so] [i think] [, uh [,] you know ,] [things] , [there's] been an awful _lot of_ social change lately [, and] [and , uh] . 
B|77| B: [and [, uh ,] i don't [know ,] a] [lot of] younger [people [,] you know ,] [into] [more] violent crimes . 
A|78| A: [it [,] it's] _really_ [nice] [. [i] would] [, [i] would] spend [all] [my] time [in] london [, or] most [of] [my] time , 
B|79| B: [they're] [real] [good] [, but] [they do] [come] [on] [kind of] late [, but] [we] [really] [do] [enjoy] those . sometimes [we] [get] [to] watching some stuff [on the] discovery channel .
