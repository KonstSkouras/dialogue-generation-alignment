A|36| A: _yeah_ 
B|37| B: [right] [that's] true _. i_ knew _that ._ 
A|38| A: [and] [that's] [you know] [that's] [the] way [they] wanted _to do_ [it] .

B|39| B: [but] [they] selectively culled _those_ litters [i mean] [for] many hundreds [of] [years] [and] since [it] slept [in] [the] castle [with] its master [i mean] [it] _had_ [it] _had_ [to be] [of] [a] disposition [to] _make_ [it] [you know] [an] animal [you] could keep around [that] closely _. but_ [they] [would] go through [all] [the] litters [and] destroy [the] puppies [if] [they were] anything other than perfect . _now_ [you know] [that] seems [like] [a] cruel thing [to do] . 
A|40| A: [i think] [that's] _coming_ [and i think] once once [people] [really] start [to] communicate _how_ [they] feel [things] [are] [going to] change . [until] then [i think] [you know] _it's_ [going [to] be] [really] painful . [so] [the] question [is] _how_ soon [are] [we] [going to] start [to get] our money's worth _and as_ [you] said _it's_ _how_ soon [we] [get] _involved_ [and i think] [we] need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to get] _involved_ [like] allowing us [to] call [a] toll free number [and] say hey _look_ [do] [it] _this_ way [not] [that] way or [i] [like] _this_ or _i don't_ _like that_ or _this_ [is] _how_ [i] feel _about_ your spending [my] [money] [on] art [that _i] don't think_ [is] art . 
B|41| B: recently [my] most recent trip [was] _last year_ _and that_ [was] detroit . 
A|42| A: [and that] [really] helped us [out] [a] great deal . [so] [. but] [my husband] [does] [get] vacation [and] _it's_ _worked out_ [really] good [for] us _too ._ 
B|43| B: [i don't] [i don't think] [they] should [be] forced [but [i] think] [they] should [be] [i] guess encouraged [to] [to do] [some] [kind of] public work [i] guess [to] [just] [to get] _them_ [i] guess [involved] [with] community [maybe] _you know just_ community activity . [if] nothing else see [how] [the] city _works_ stuff [like _that] ._ 
A|44| A: _we have_ [you know] [you] can't [just] [just] hope [for] abstinence . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh] relaxed [and] laid [back] [and] stuff 
A|46| A: [and i] thought [well] [that's] interesting i'll call [them] . 
B|47| B: [and as] far [as] [like] [them] [uh] entertaining [the] rights [that] [they] should [have .] 
A|48| A: [right .] [and] [what] type [of] recommendations _did_ [you have] when [you] decided _where_ [to] _place_ _him_ ? 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] _oh_ no . 
A|50| A: [well] [what] [kind of] garden [do] [you have] ? 
B|51| B: [so uh] [but [i] think] [there] [are] [some] wonderful child care opportunities [out] [there] [for] [children] [but] [and we] [all] [know] [the] [kind of] [things] [that] you're supposed [to] [look] [for] _. [i_ think] 
A|52| A: [oh] _yeah [._ [i] had] [a] [uh] [last year] [i had] [i had] another german shepherd [now] _this_ [one] [was] purebred [and] [uh] [he] when [he] [was] _about_ seven months old [got] [a] gastrointestinal virus [and] [was] [just] _about_ [on] death's door [but] [uh] managed [to get] _him_ [to] [a] veterinarian [in] [time] 
B|53| B: _and they_ [would] [you know] [i] [i] picked off [like] twenty [of] [them] [and] 
A|54| A: [uh] [not] _too_ much . [uh] [i] [got] [a] [bit] . [actually] 
B|55| B: sure . 
A|56| A: [yes .] [right] [that] [would] [be] [the] intent [of] [it] . 
B|57| B: [you] ever heard [of] [that] ? 
A|58| A: [i] tell [you] [those] prices [have] [just] unbelievably come down . 
B|59| B: [yeah] [i] [would] [i] [would] [like] [to] [too] [because] [it's] [a] lot [of] [things] [coming] [up] _here_ lately [about] her [you know] possibilities [of] [of] [where] _she_ 
A|60| A: [well] _we have_ _it just_ opposite [here] [. my] wife [works] [in] [you know] _at_ _at_ _at [the_ t i] [and] she's [uh] sedentary [all] day long [so] when [she] gets [home] [she] likes [to] mow . 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [i] [have] [to] say [that .] 
B|63| B: [right right .] 
A|64| A: [uh] [i] want [to] talk [about] [um] our family budget [and the] times [that] [it's] _worked_ [and the] times [that] [it] hasn't _worked_ [and] _give_ [you] [a] general description [of] [it] 
B|65| B: [uh] [at] [this] point . 
A|66| A: [my] truck [is] broken down . 
B|67| B: [yeah] 
A|68| A: [i] _can_ [just] [make] [out] his _place_ [you know] . [i've] [got] [a] thirty mile view [to] [the] east [and] [about] ten miles [to] [the] north . 
B|69| B: [so] [that's] why [the] defense [is] [there] picking through [them] whereas [at the] same [time] [the uh] [the] prosecutor sitting [there] picking through [them] [because he] wants somebody who _will_ [give] [him] [uh] [a] guilty verdict [if] [the] facts warrant . 
A|70| A: [they] [they] went [to] [all] [all] ... 
B|71| B: [uh] [we have] fifty acres . 
A|72| A: [okay] . 
B|73| B: [yeah] [yeah] 
A|74| A: everybody says [that] 
B|75| B: [you] [too .] 
A|76| A: [oh] [i] bet [it] [is] [too .] 
B|77| B: two cats [and] [just] [as] easy [it just] never started smelling [i] [would] put [just] [a little] [bit] [of] cat litter [in] [there] [because] [if i] put [a] lot _one of the_ cats [would have] [been] 
A|78| A: yep [that] [will] [that] [will] slow [you] [up] 
B|79| B: [well] [if] [it's] [a second] offense [the] [punishment] should certainly [be] _more_ severe than [a] first offense [because] obviously [the] rehabilitation process [did] [not] work [the] first [time] . 
A|80| A: [so] i'll tell [them] [that] [and they] won't or [just] [you know just] answer [one of the] questions [the] wrong way [because you] _can_ [do] [that] [you know] 
B|81| B: [the] [place] [she] [works] [with] [worked] [with] [before] [um] [worked out] [an] arrangement [with] her [where] [she] [can] work _at home_ part [time] 
A|82| A: [that's] large [if] your kids aren't [at home] any [more] .
