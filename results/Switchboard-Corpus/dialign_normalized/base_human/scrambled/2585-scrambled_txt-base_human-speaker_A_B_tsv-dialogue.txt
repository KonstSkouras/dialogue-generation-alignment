B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [and] [go] after [you know] [it's] [lot] easy [to go] after [and] follow [a] fire department [or] [a] police officer [and uh] [find] [out] news [from] [that] [as] opposed [to] [going] [out and] finding [good] [things] [so] [. i don't] [know [i] guess] [the] economy [is] [is] effecting also [the] news media
