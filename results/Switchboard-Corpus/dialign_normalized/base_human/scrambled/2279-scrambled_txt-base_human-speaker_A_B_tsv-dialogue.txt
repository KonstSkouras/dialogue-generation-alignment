A|0| A: _yeah _, but_ _i_ mean _,_ _in_ ,_ _here_ _it's _,_ uh , _to_ the_ point _where_ _they_ _were_ letting prisoners _go_ _. uh ,_ commuting _the_ sentences _of_ _those_ _that_ _were_ _in _,_ in_ jail _for_ lesser crimes _, in_ order _to_ _put_ _more_ _people_ _in ,_ into _the_ jails . 
B|1| B: huh ? 
A|2| A: _it's _,_ uh _,_ when you_ _come_ _to_ this _part _of_ the_ country , _we've_ _been_ away _from_ dallas long enough _that_ _you_ _see_ _the_ difference _in_ housing . 
B|3| B: _oh _,_ they_ _do_ great _. i_ [put] mine [in] _probably_ [in] november . 
A|4| A: _yeah _,_ well _,_ it's_ _been_ _nice_ _talking to _you_ _,_ we_ seem _to be_ degenerating _here _,_ so_ 
B|5| B: _oh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _so_ _it's kind of_ _, uh ,_ _become_ _an_ issue _you_ _could_ _say_ . 
B|7| B: _you _know_ _,_ the_ poor trees , said _what_ 
A|8| A: _so ._ 
B|9| B: _no_ _one_ _would_ _want_ [the] job 
A|10| A: _that's_ _just_ _not_ realistic . 
B|11| B: [yeah _,] uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: [yeah ,] _same_ _with_ drunk drivers . 
A|14| A: _but ,_ _that's_ _been_ _, it's_ _been_ fun _, _i_ mean_ _it's_ _a lot_ _of_ work _to_ _see_ _that_ she's prepared _but it's_ _been_ fun _, it's_ _been_ fun _, i feel like_ _i've_ _learned_ _a lot_ _about_ [the] piano . _i've_ _learned_ _a lot_ _about_ _playing the_ piano . 
B|15| B: years _, uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _but _,_ _um _,_ i_ don't_ [know] _do you_ _like_ _, i guess_ _your_ cat _was_ _an_ indoor cat . 
B|17| B: _it_ seems [to be] catching _on [,_ uh ,] slowly [but] surely [, i guess] 
A|18| A: [oh .] 
B|19| B: [oh .] 
A|20| A: [yeah _,] uh , i_ _was_ _living in_ northern jersey _when_ _that_ _law_ _came_ through , remember hearing _all_ _about_ _it ,_ 
B|21| B: [but] [here] _again_ [i] [go] _back_ [to the] second amendment _you can_ disagree _by_ freedom [of] speech which , _has_ nothing [to] [do] _with_ action . 
A|22| A: this _guy_ _had_ supposedly [, uh ,] strangled this woman _and_ stuffed cotton toweling _down_ _her_ throat _and_ _up_ _her_ nose anyway , this _is_ _happened_ [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|23| B: _okay [._ uh _,] _right_ now_ _we're_ [living [in] [,] well] [it's] _me_ _, my_ wife _and , uh ,_ _two_ young boys _. _and ,_ uh _,_ _right_ now_ _we're_ _in a_ [, uh [, i] guess] [it's] either [a] zero [lot] line _or_ [a] garden _home_ . which [you] might call _it ._ 
A|24| A: [i] hope _so ._ 
B|25| B: [yeah [,] _i] , i_ won't _really_ [be] interested [in] going [to] [, in] going _there_ . _because_ [, i feel like] _i'm , i'm_ paying _, you _know_ ,_ five dollars _for the_ food _probably_ [and] five dollars [for] _something_ [that] _i could_ _get_ _along_ quite [well] without 
A|26| A: _that's_ _right _._ _yeah_ ._ _that's _a_ real_ waste _too ._ _it really_ _is_ . 
B|27| B: [oh .] 
A|28| A: [okay] [, uh _,] do you_ work outside [the] [home] ? 
B|29| B: [yeah [,] _i] read_ _that ,_ [too _.] _i_ got_ [it [,] uh _,] _right_ ,_ after [it] [came] _out_ _. my _,_ uh , you _know_ ,_ 
A|30| A: _and they_ _had_ [, i] _was_ _just_ thinking _about_ [one] [the] _other_ _day_ [. _uh ,] _if_ i_ saw [a] picture [of] john elway _in _the_ [,_ _in] the_ cafeteria at school _, um _,_ but_ [they] _did_ [the] johnny angel . [they] _did_ johnny elway [to] _that ._ 
B|31| B: [and] progressive tax _, _i think_ , uh ,_ _does_ [not] give [people] incentive [to] make [more] _money_ _, and_ _what_ [i mean] _by_ _that _,_ the_ [more] income [you] make _, the_ [more] tax [you] _pay_ . 
A|32| A: _yeah ._ 
B|33| B: [and] _we _,_ _the_ , the_ principal feature [i] [like] [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
A|34| A: [i , i] wasn't helping _them_ [. i] _worked_ [with] _them _,_ not_ [to] help _them _,_ but_ _for my_ own purposes . [i'm , i'm] [a] linguist [and] [i] _was_ [, uh ,] doing [a] language , _trying _to_ learn_ their language , _a little bit_ [. and] [i] actually _, _um ,_ _i_ mean ,_ helped _them_ _them_ _in the_ sense [that] [they] received [money] [for] working [with] [me] . _but i_ _didn't_ [, i] _didn't_ [, i] wasn't [a] social worker [or] _anything_ _like that ._ 
B|35| B: [well [,] uh , i] recommend [it ,] _because_ _you just_ walk [right] _on_ [in _,] and_ there's usually [not] anybody [in] line 
A|36| A: [it's] _an_ accusation _, _and ,_ and_ [it's] [and] [it's] based [on _,] on a_ perception [that] someone [has] _as_ how [a] drug user [would] behave _when_ _some_ drug users behave [, uh ,] normal [, uh , you know] . 
B|37| B: [yeah _.] so_ _what_ [do _you] do_ [up] _there_ ? 
A|38| A: [yeah .] _well , i_ took _a lot_ [of] time [in] choosing this site [because] [the , the] _house_ [has] [no] heating [or] air conditioning . 
B|39| B: [but it's] upper middle class [, uh ,] [kind of] [an] environment . 
A|40| A: _no _,_ i've_ done _some_ walking [with] friends _in the_ past . 
B|41| B: [they] certainly enjoy [that] [part of] [it] [it's] [just] [trying to] keep [anything] [. i] planted bulbs _last_ [, uh ,] fall _on the_ _side_ guard [, and] _when i_ went _out_ _there_ [in the] spring _and the_ _first_ [day] [they] [came] _out_ [the] [little] [one] went [and] pulled _all the_ _flowers_ _off_ [, _and] the_ flower petals [were] scattered [all] _over_ [the] walk 
A|42| A: _yes ,_ _our_ [first] [and] _he_ [just] turned _three_ months . 
B|43| B: [and [, _and] ,] uh _,_ it_ _will_ [come] _back_ [to] haunt _us_ _, it_ seems [to] [come] [in] cycles . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] applied at [all] . 
B|45| B: [well [,] the] _good_ stuff . [right .] 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: _now _,_ um ,_ 
B|49| B: [well [,] not] [so] _much_ _that as_ [it] [is] [, i've] [had] [so] _many_ times _when [,_ uh [,] uh , you _know] ,_ i'll _have a_ friend _next_ [to] [me] [or] [i] [see] somebody [, uh ,] [guy] broken [down] _on the_ _side_ [of the] road [and] try [to] lean _over and_ _roll_ [down] [the] window . 
A|50| A: [and] how [it] serves [us] given [the] extraordinarily large sum [of] [money] [the] government [has] [to] operate [with] . 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: hello ann . 
B|53| B: [because] [you] _got_ [to] , watch [them] every [day] [, and] keep [them] watered 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh _.] do you _have_ to_ watch _what_ [you] eat _pretty_ regularly ? 
A|56| A: [yeah ,] _he_ sure _did_ . 
B|57| B: _and [you_ _know] [,_ _if] _you_ can_ [do] _any_ [a little bit] _, it_ helps [, so] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] [what] _did_ [they] name him ? 
B|59| B: [well] . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] [okay .] [well] _i don't_ [know] [any] _other_ magazines [i could] talk _to you_ [about] . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh] 
A|62| A: [and , [and] you] [put] [the] chicken [in ,] _then_ pour [the [,] uh ,] broth [over [and] [you] can] [put] mushrooms [in] [if _you] want_ _, and then_ [you just] . 
B|63| B: [no] . 
A|64| A: [is] _it [in_ the] phone book ? 
B|65| B: _oh [,_ well] [my] favorite [, [well ,] [i] [, i] don't] [really] _have a_ favorite [, [i] , i] [like] everything basically . [um [, i] guess] [if i] [had] [to] pick _, it_ [would] [be] [like] pop _, i would_ _think [,_ but i] [like] everything _. so [,_ [it's] kind of] _hard_ [to] choose sometimes . 
A|66| A: [right now] _we [have_ a] [pretty] _nice_ recycling program _where_ _a lot_ [of the] recyclable materials [can] [be] picked [up] [by] [the ,] [by] [the] collection agency [or] [the , the] city [along] [with] _your_ garbage [can] [. [uh _,] you] can_ [put] [out] newspaper _, you can_ [put] [out] glass _, you can_ [put] [out] aluminum cans _, you can_ [put] , [put] [out] certain types [of] plastic material [and] [that] [is] _on a_ [roll] [out] effort [right _now] ._ [not] [all the] citizens [and the] [people] [in] plano [can] [go] ahead [and , uh ,] participate [right _now] _,_ but [,_ uh _,] that_ [will] [be] rolled [out] [to] everyone [, i] hope [, [in] the] [next] _year_ [or] _so [._ and] _those_ [that] aren't participating [, _they] have_ [the] specific drop [off] sites _where_ [you can] take glass [and] newspaper [and] aluminum [. and] [i think , uh ,] overall _that's_ [an] , [an] excellent opportunity _because i_ hate [to] [see] _our_ landfills being filled [up] [and , uh ,] growing bigger [and] bigger [and] bigger _where_ [they] _are_ becoming [a] big _problem_ [for] [not] only [the] [people] [that] _are_ [living] today [, but] [for the] future _also_ [. so ,] 
B|67| B: [yeah _,] my husband_ calls [her] street dog [, but] [we've] [had] [her] [now] [for] [about] [three] years , 
A|68| A: [yeah .] [oh ,] [okay _.] yeah [,_ [you] do] _then_ . 
B|69| B: [all] set _. do [you_ _want] to_ start ? 
A|70| A: [and] [in the] summertime [we] [get] [the] prettiest yellow [flowers] . 
B|71| B: [i think] [that's] [become] [more] outstanding _than_ [it] used [to be] [where] women _, i think_ used [to be] [a little bit] afraid [of] coming _out and_ saying _something_ . 
A|72| A: [when] _they're_ decreasing _some_ [of the] military spending , _some_ _of that_ [money] [has] gone into [the] peace corps 
B|73| B: [you _know] [,_ so] [we have] [really] [been] frustrated [by] [our] gardening attempts [here [,] [and ,] [uh ,] [if] you] [really] water [a lot] [, you can] [do] [it [,] but [,] you _know] [,_ when _you] _have_ to pay for_ water _, it really_ gets [to be] [an] annoyance [to] _have to_ water constantly . 
A|74| A: [oh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [some] [we] [do] green [and then] [my] wife puts [them] [on] pizzas _. and , and_ chops [them] [up] [in] recipes [and] things [like that .] 
A|76| A: [i] [just] [don't] hear [much] [about] [it] anymore . [like] [i] _say [,_ i don't] even [know] [what] programs _are_ , _are_ even ongoing _now [,_ you know] . 
B|77| B: _right ,_ traumatized [for] life _here ._ 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [and [, uh ,] i] [also] [like] [to] plant [flowers] [and] [do] [do] [some] gardening [and] [do] arts [and] crafts . 
A|80| A: [see] , [that's] [we've] _we had a_ _problem_ [with] [that .] 
B|81| B: [and then] while [he] [was] [on] appeal [on] _his_ thousandth [and] [one] appeal [, the] state [of] california revoked [the] [law] [in the] early seventies [, and then] [they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty [didn't] [go] _back_ _. [you_ know] ? 
A|82| A: [i read] [my] newspaper [. _i] can_ hardly wait [in the] mornings [for the] newspaper _to get_ [here [,] you know] . 
B|83| B: [well _,] yeah [,_ [that] .] 
A|84| A: _i know_ [that] [when i] [was] [in] school [and] getting [my] degree at [the] [same] time [my husband] [was] [, it] [was] [really] [hard] [on] [our] _family_ _because [i_ _would] ,_ [he] [would] [come] [home] [and] [i would] leave , 
B|85| B: [that's] _from the_ child's standpoint . [the] child [is] going , why [don't] [you _want] to be_ close [to] [me] [and] [your] [other] [family] . 
A|86| A: [yeah _.] yeah ,_ 
B|87| B: [oh .] 
A|88| A: [and , uh ,] [also] [, uh [,] in] [one] [of] [my] wife's [, uh ,] companies [where] she _worked_ , they'd _had _a_ real nice_ profit sharing plan _that , [that_ ,] 
B|89| B: [yeah [,] i] [learned] [, [i] , i] [learned] wordstar [, uh , i] [did] [some] typing [for my] father [when] [he] [had] [the] company 
A|90| A: [oh] [it's] tough [, it really] [is] . 
B|91| B: [right] 
A|92| A: [because] _they have_ this weird opinion [that] [if you] use [that] card [, you] [don't] [have to pay _for] [it_ .] 
B|93| B: [yes ,] [yes] [. i] agree . 
A|94| A: [two] [living] areas . [we [have] a] [living] room [and] dining room at [the] front [of the] _house_ , 
B|95| B: huh-uh . 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [so [,] i guess] [the] [problem] [is] [the , the] thing [to] [do] [is] [to] try [to] [, uh , [to] get] [some] [kind of] motivation [to learn] [and ,] 
A|98| A: [and _,] um [,_ [so] [,] and] [we're] [on the] colder [side] , _they're_ [on the] rainy [side] , [we're] [on the] snowy [side] [and _,] um _,_ we , we_ ski [. my [,] my] children [all] ski 
B|99| B: [i'm] [for [it] in] [in] [some] cases . 
A|100| A: [okay .] how [many] _kids_ [do you have] ? 
B|101| B: [and [they] [have] a] bunch [of] computers leftover [from] [that] 
A|102| A: [yeah .] [we have] [some] [of] [them] _around [here_ [.] you] [probably] [have] [more] [there] , though [, i would] imagine . 
B|103| B: [no [,] in] _fact [,_ in] _fact_ [the] cowboys _got_ [the] best end [of that] deal . 
A|104| A: [i don't] [know [,] i] [just] [think _,] um ,_ somehow [i] hoped [that as] [a] [people] [we] [could] [be] better [than] , [than] _, um ,_ expecting [, the] feeling [that] [it] 
B|105| B: [i , i] couldn't handle [that] 
A|106| A: [right [,] [right] .] 
B|107| B: [and , and] [be] paroled [, and] [and] [have] served [the] sentence , 
A|108| A: [so [,] _so] [i_ guess] [our] vote [is] [no] 
B|109| B: [i think] [two] . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [i] definitely [think] [they] should [be] tested [. and] [i'm] [not] [, i'm] [not] opposed [to] [any] testing [. [i] mean] [because [i] know] [i] certainly _wouldn't_ _want to_ [, to] [, uh , you [know] ,] [be] endangered [by] somebody _in a_ company [that] accidentally dropped _something_ [on] [me] [or] , [or] [you [know] ,] [because] [he] [was] [on] drugs while [he] [was] [there] . 
A|112| A: _and _so_ _i_ kind of_ stay 
B|113| B: [i , [i] kind of] wish [i] [had] [them ,] [those] size property [and [, [and] ,] uh ,] [one] [with] [a] grade [on] [it] [so [i] can] build [a real nice] deck . 
A|114| A: [okay [.] do you have] [any] pets ? 
B|115| B: [yeah .] unfortunately . 
A|116| A: wow , [that's] large 
B|117| B: [well , i] enjoyed [talking to _you] ._ 
A|118| A: [uh-huh .] _well [, my_ husband] [wouldn't] [do] [that] anyway . [that's] [his] , [that's] [his] , 
B|119| B: [uh ,] grapevine [, do [you] know] grapevine ? 
A|120| A: [and] [he] goes [out and] commits [it] [again] . [fact ,] he's [back] [in] jail _now [._ so _,] what_ _, what_ [, uh ,] 
B|121| B: [yeah .] 
A|122| A: [okay] [, it] [does] sound [like] [you have] [some] children [to] take care [of] 
B|123| B: [well , my] dad wants [me] [to] [go] [back] [. [so] .] 
A|124| A: substitute [. my _,] my [,_ yeah ,] 
B|125| B: [and [, uh _,] i] think_ [that's] sort [of] [what] [happened] [with] louisiana [because] , [because] [, um [,] the] [guy] [did] [get] elected , correct ? 
A|126| A: [no [,] [i] know] [when [,] um _,] we_ [just] _, we_ moved [here [,] uh , i] [from [the] [,] [i] got] [a] summons , jury summons , 
B|127| B: [uh ,] [for [the] [,] [and] [so] [,] [you] [,] on] [that] [it's] [not] unusual , [for] example , [for] somewhere [around here] [on a] [, on a] [, on a] [, what] [we] [would [,] you [know] [,] what] [you] described [as] [your] [house] [and] [what] [i would] describe [as] [my] [house] [say ,] [for] example [, in] pensacola , florida [, on] [that] [house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and so] forth [and so] [on ,] might [pay] [three] [or] _four hundred_ dollars [a] [year] taxes . maybe [, you [know] ,] maybe [a little bit] higher [than] [that] [now ,] 
A|128| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|129| B: [and , uh [,] it's] [about] [a] five [year] old [house] [now .] 
A|130| A: [yeah .] [that's] [good] , [that's] [good] . 
B|131| B: thanks . bye-bye . 
A|132| A: [they] [they] can't [do] [anything] [, so] [i've] _never [,_ i think] _we had_ fish [when i] [was] [a] kid [but [i] don't] , 
B|133| B: [yes] . [we've] [, my [,] uh [,] well [,] when] [we] [first] [got] married [, my] wife [worked] _for a_ [year] . [then] [we] decided [to] [have] [kids] . 
A|134| A: that'd [probably] [be] [pretty] interesting [. i] [was] summonsed [down] [to the] courthouse [last] week . [they] [had] summonsed eight [hundred] [people] , [about] [four hundred] showed [up] [, and] [it] [was] [for a] murder trial . 
B|135| B: [i think] [it] [would] [be] [really] . [really] great . 
A|136| A: [my] husband's mother [will] [have] major surgery [and] we'll find [out] [about] [it [in] a] casual conversation . she'll let [something] slip [and] we'll [say ,] wait [a] minute [. and , and] [that's] [it ,] she , [just] [, well] [i] [didn't] [want to] bother [you .] she can't accept _that we_ [want to be] [the] care givers . 
B|137| B: [so] [we] [are] [never [,] we] [never] cheer against denver unless [they're] [playing the] cowboys . 
A|138| A: [yeah ,] [that's] . [but ,] 
B|139| B: [that's a] whole [other] topic [to] begin [with] [too] [but] [. [yeah ,] [but] [it's] [,] you] [are] [right [.] [i] , [i] , i] [really] agree [that , that] [that's] [pretty] important . 
B|140| B: [i mean [,] we , [we] had a] car once [that we] tried [to] [have] declared [a] lemon under [the] lemon [law] which [is] extremely difficult [to] [do] .
