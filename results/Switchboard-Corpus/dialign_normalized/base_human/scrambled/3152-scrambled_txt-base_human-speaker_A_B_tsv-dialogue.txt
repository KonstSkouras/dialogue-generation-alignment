A|22| A: probably [so] _. yeah_ [you] _can_ _get_ [a] head start _on_ [it] . [like] ice [in] 
B|23| B: _oh [yeah_ .] 
A|24| A: _you get_ [some] pollutants such _as_ those [but] those [are] natural 
B|25| B: [yeah well i i] do _uh you know_ craft work [and] sell stuff [at] shows _and that_ [and uh] _uh you know_ [it's] [it's] [it's] [a] real eye-opener [as] _far_ [as] [you know] why people charge [what] [they] do _to [you_ know .] 
A|26| A: [uh] premeditated murder . crimes [of] [that] nature [i think] [should] definitely 
B|27| B: [but] [he] [was] living alone [had] [an] upstairs [apartment] _could_ barely make [it] [up] [the] steps [to the] top without [a] great deal [of] pain 
A|28| A: huh ? okay . 
B|29| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|30| A: [i] _like the_ moody blues . did [you] [like] _them_ ?

B|33| B: [i] _see_ . 
A|34| A: minneapolis area 
B|35| B: [they they] do .

B|37| B: [uh our] [our] _kids_ love pickles [and] [we] [all] love pickles [so] we're _going_ [to] _try to_ grow [our] own pickles this year . 
A|38| A: [well] [that's] _really_ [yeah] [that's] [i] bet [that] [was] nice . 
B|39| B: [so] 
A|40| A: [i think] [the] drive [by] shootings [are] getting _to be_ [so] common [that's] _really_ [a] _something_ [you] _got_ [to] protect yourself from . 
B|41| B: [uh] 
A|42| A: gosh . 
B|43| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|44| A: _than_ [we] [think] . _sure_ . _sure_ . 
B|45| B: [so] _any_ _any_ anybody [that] says life [in] prison [with] [no] chance [of] parole i'd say [uh] give [them] [the] death penalty [so] 
A|46| A: [oh] [uh-huh _.] [yeah_ .] 
B|47| B: [and] [it was] difficult [to] _hold_ [them] together _. and_ then [of] course [he] died two _years ago_ _so you know_ [that] family has gone _down_ [to] [one] brother [and] [one] sister [now] . 
A|48| A: [are you] ready ? 
B|49| B: [i think] attitudes [are] more lax [now] [than] [they] [used to be] . 
A|50| A: [and] [you know i] will watch [that] [some] _if_ [i'm] reading [or] _doing_ _something_ else [you know] [with] _him ._ 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [and] [you] _can_ [just] [see] [the] [things] [that] _they're_ trying [to] show [with] music . 
B|53| B: [they] [can] [go] [right] [on] [doing] [the] same old thing [they] always [used to] . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [yeah [.] i] guess [that's] [what] retirement [is] [all] [about] . 
A|56| A: _and the_ [one] boy killed himself [a] few [years ago] _in the_ [in] [a] grade [school] [so you know] these [kids] _don't have_ [any] trouble getting [a] [hold] [of] guns [in] [any] [in] [any] neighborhood doesn't seem [like] . 
B|57| B: [well _i] mean_ [it] seems [to] _me_ [that] generally [at] least [in] _my_ own experience _when i_ purchase [something] mail order [it's] _not_ [to] circumvent paying sales tax [to the] _state_ [of] pennsylvania . [it's] because [i'm] sorry [the] commonwealth [of] pennsylvania . 
A|58| A: [and that] [was] _even_ harder [for] [i was] [on] [a] business trip [at] _the time_ _and the_ _dog_ [was] being house sit [or] _dog_ sit whatever [by] [some] friends [of] mine [down] [the] street 
B|59| B: [right .] 
A|60| A: [yeah .] [but] [it's] [i _i] [know_ .] 
B|61| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [oh _yeah] _yeah_ yeah ._ 
B|63| B: [i know] there's [you know] _when_ [you] adjust _your_ income [for] [what] [you] put [out] [for] day-care [you know] you're [only] making [like] five . 
A|64| A: [so] [are] [they] currently practicing capital punishment [in] [your] [state] ? 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [but] also [most] places [like] _big_ star does _and _i'm not_ sure_ _if_ kroger does [or] [not] [but] 
B|67| B: [yeah yeah .] 
A|68| A: [oh] okay . 
B|69| B: [i] [that] true [yeah [.] [yeah] she's] [even] [got] [she's] [got] [one] [dog] [now] [and the] two [cats] [and] her [dog] [there] [is] [is] basically [a] reject somebody [had] bought [him] [and] _wanted_ [him .] 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| B: [oh] [you [get] that] stuff [in the] mail _all [the_ _time] ._ 
A|72| A: [yeah] [you know] [it] _makes_ sense _um_ [you know] _you _have_ the_ occasional person who may [have] been falsely accused [but] [i mean] [uh] [so] few [and] [far] between [uh you know] _makes_ [good] t v movies [and] [that's] [about] [it] . 
B|73| B: [right .] [well] do [you] [think] [that] [should] [be] implemented [in the] work place . [you know] [as] _like a_ manager [or] supervisor thinks [or] has suspicion [that] _someone_ [is] using drugs do [you] [think] [they] [should] [have the] [right] [to] send _them [to_ be] tested . 
A|74| A: [yeah .] 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: [and uh] [it was] nice _talking_ [to you] . 
B|77| B: [it] seems _like a_ lot [of] times [the] law [is] [is] totally [on] [the] criminal side _and and_ [isn't] protecting [the] rest _of the_ people . 
A|78| A: [and uh] [it] kind [of] _makes_ [me] listen _a little_ closer [to] [to the] piano [when i] hear [it] [at] _other_ places [or] [when i] [you know] [see] [some] [see] [and] hear [someone] playing [. i] sort [of] watch _their_ technique _too_ [and and] [see] _if_ [it] corresponds [up] [to] [what] [she's] [learning] . 
B|79| B: [uh [i] don't] [i don't] [even] [think] [that] [it] [should] [be] unanimous _either_ [. uh] 
A|80| A: okay . 
B|81| B: [uh] yes [i] am . [i'm] working [in the] computer science _department_ here [uh] [at] c m u . 
A|82| A: [yeah .] 
B|83| B: _and it's_ [just] different [things] _you have to_ talk [to] [them] [about] [now [that] you] [would] [never] [even] [have] dreamt _to _have_ to_ say anything [about] . 
A|84| A: [yeah] 
B|85| B: [well] another reason [well i] guess [i] can't say [that] _it i don't [like_ the] rain completely [. we] _have [a_ little] garden [that we] [have] [and and] [so] [it] [really] helps [our] garden 
A|86| A: [well [i] don't] [either] unless [it's] [like] [uh] [some of] [my] favorite's [like a] friday night [when] [it] rains [and] [you] [really] didn't [have] anywhere [to] [go] [and it's] sleeping [time .] [but] _if_ [you have to] [get] [up and] [get] [out] [in] [it i don't like] [it] [either] 
B|87| B: [it was] real hilly . 
A|88| A: [uh] . explained *listen; [could] [be] br 
B|89| B: [but] [uh] 
A|90| A: normally [i mean] [he] didn't seem [to _have] a problem with_ getting wet [but] _if_ [you] [wanted] [to] [get] [him] wet forget [it] . 
B|91| B: [well] [it] [really] [isn't] [too] [big] yet [. we] [we] [a] lot [of] people say [that] [but um] [it's] 
A|92| A: [she's] ninety-two . 
B|93| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [oh [yeah] yeah .] 
B|95| B: [i think] [that] helps . 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [that's] [my] understanding [of the] way [uh] [the] way [it] _works_ . usually [the] [the] person ordering doesn't pay . [but] [the] accounting [department] will [uh] suck [up] [all the] bills [at] [the] end [of the] month [and] realize how much [they] [have to] pay [. and] [there] [there are] [some] substantial nasty penalties [um] _if_ [you] _if_ businesses [try to] avoid [that] . 
B|99| B: [right .] 
A|100| A: [really] ? [have] [you] served [on] [a jury] ? 
B|101| B: [uh] cause [that] [makes] [a] [big] difference . [my] wife [works] part-time . 
A|102| A: [yeah .] 
B|103| B: [oh] yes [they're] [both] running around [now] . 
A|104| A: [really] ? 
B|105| B: [and] [if] [we] [had] [something] [to] do before [they] [get] [to be] full-blown adult criminals [and i'm not] [talking] [about] necessarily [in the] [school] system [i'm not sure] [that] [the] [school] system [should] [be] [the] agent [of] [all the] social action . 
A|106| A: [well] church softball leagues [so] 
B|107| B: [yeah .] 
A|108| A: these [some of] these young [kids] [you] read [about] [just] doesn't bother [them to] kill [someone] [at] [all] 
B|109| B: [um] personally [i [don't] [have] a problem with] [it] [uh [i] think] [uh] [as] [far] [as] [uh] protecting fellow employees protecting [their] reputation [of the] company [and the] quality [of] work [that] [the] people do [um] [it's] justified . [on] [the] [other] hand [um] [i] do agree [that] [it's] [it's] [a] [it's] [an] invasion [of] privacy [as] [far] [as] [a] person's involvement [outside] [of] work . 
A|110| A: [and] [as] [i] look [out] [the] window [of] [my] trailer [i] [can] envision [all the] insulation [that's] [going] [up] today 
B|111| B: [uh] [a] lot [of] [i] guess [is] . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh .]
