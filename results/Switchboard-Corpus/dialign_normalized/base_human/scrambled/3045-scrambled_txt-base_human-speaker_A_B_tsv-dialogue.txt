A|0| A: _yeah ._ 
B|1| B: now _i_ am _i_ am adamantly against _that ._ 
A|2| A: _not_ _the_ harsh criminality , [that] _you_ _find_ _in_ , 
B|3| B: _yeah ,_ _he's_ [not] [that] _far_ _, _he_ was_ _sort of_ [in] _between_ strasbourg _, and_ paris . 
A|4| A: [and] [he] _is _,_ uh _,_ you can_ tell [he was] weaned _too_ young _because_ he'll nurse _on your_ ears [and] _your_ fingers . 
B|5| B: _but_ [because] _of_ [that] _we didn't have_ _very_ _many_ pets afterwards _and then_ [he] had fish . 
A|6| A: _right ._ 
B|7| B: _yeah _,_ that's_ _how_ _it_ works . 
A|8| A: [but] _here again_ [i] dress casual _quite_ _a_ _bit_ _so ,_ 
B|9| B: _oh_ 
A|10| A: _well ,_ [how] _do_ _you feel_ about setting _, _like_ _,_ well _,_ for_ example _, a_ _car_ _type_ accident _where _,_ uh , or_ _some_ incident _where_ someone loses _a_ limb . _do_ _you_ _think the_ jury _should _have_ a_ dollar figure _for_ losing _an_ arm _, a_ dollar figure _for_ losing _different_ body parts ? 
B|11| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|12| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|13| B: [but] _, um _,_ you know _,_ i_ _don't_ _, i'm_ [not] particularly concerned _with_ _what_ _people_ [do] _, um ,_ after _they_ leave [for] _the day_ especially _if_ [i] _don't_ _, if_ [i] _don't_ [, uh ,] _see_ _any_ results _of_ _it_ [the] next _day_ . 
A|14| A: [uh-huh _.] oh ,_ _okay_ _, well _,_ they_ _seem _to_ be_ _on_ later , 
B|15| B: [to] [okay] . _and i_ _don't_ _know_ _what_ [the] solution [is] . 
A|16| A: _yes_ . _yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _right , and_ [if] _they're_ overcrowded _, well [,_ you know] [they] shouldn't [have] gotten theirself _there_ _in the_ first place . 
B|19| B: _i think_ [in the] next session [they] [they] [uh] modified _it_ [but] _it's_ _still_ legal [to] own [or] possess weapons [in] [uh] [uh] florida . 
A|20| A: [i] [have] _two_ . 
B|21| B: [but] _, uh , _i_ [,_ uh ,] _yeah [,_ for] _one_ _thing_ _. uh ,_ [but] _yeah _,_ we_ [, uh _,] we_ [do] [but] _our_ [two] had , had [, uh ,] totally [different] interests _of ,_ [but] _there was not_ _much_ [, uh ,] overlap as _such_ . _the _,_ the_ older _one_ _is not_ , _was not_ at _all_ into [, uh ,] sports [for] [the] most part _. uh _,_ he_ participated band _and _,_ _and ,_ uh ,_ scouts _were_ his [two] big things . 
A|22| A: [that] [and] sleeping late 
B|23| B: [oh] gosh . 
A|24| A: _but i_ _did_ _a_ walk _last_ _night_ [, _and] it_ seemed _like_ [it] [was] _a little bit_ hot [still] . sometimes _when_ [you] work _up_ _a_ sweat [you] need [it] _to be_ _a little bit_ cooler . 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: _right ._ 
B|27| B: [did] _you ,_ [did] [you] sue _him_ under [the] civil system ? 
A|28| A: [i] _have a_ thirteen _year_ old daughter _and _so_ we_ _go_ bike riding [and] [it's] nice . _we get_ _to spend_ _some_ time together rather _than _i_ go_ _to the_ gym while _she_ does _her_ homework . 
B|29| B: _i mean _,_ it's_ [like _,] if you_ plan _a year_ ahead [, you can] _probably_ save [up] _seven_ hundred dollars _you know ,_ _one_ thousand four hundred dollars [to] _send your child to_ college [, _you know] ._ 
A|30| A: [and then] [i] _want_ [, you know ,] good [, uh ,] gas mileage [and i] _want_ _an_ air bag [and [, uh _,] i] guess ,_ 
B|31| B: [uh , _i] think_ i'd [like] _to get_ [, uh ,] b m w [or] [if] [i go] [the] german route , _which_ _i'm_ _kind of_ leaning towards [right] now , [but] [, uh , or] _maybe_ [a] _, i mean [,_ a] [, a] acura legend _. uh_ 
A|32| A: _but i_ [know] [they] _let_ [you ,] they'll _let_ [you] decrease [how] [many] hours [you] work by [kind of] percentage . [you know ,] they'll _let_ [you] work halftime [if you] _want _to_ [,_ if you] _want to_ finish , 
B|33| B: [uh-huh .] [right .] 
A|34| A: _they don't_ _go and_ [see] _them ._ [that's] [right .] 
B|35| B: [well ,] _we've_ tried _having_ , [let] _me_ turn [the] _t_ v _off_ , _we've_ tried _having_ [a] vegetable garden [, and] _i'm_ from chicago [, and] _the way_ [that] [, uh ,] bugs [and] weeds grow _down here_ [is] _very_ [different] from chicago . _and we_ [have] tried _several_ _years_ _in a_ row [, and] _we've_ given [up] _, between_ [the] fire ants _, the_ pill bugs _, the_ weeds _, the_ drought [, and] [a] hundred [and] _ten_ degree heat _all_ summer [, _and] _we_ just_ _kind of [,_ uh ,] decided [to] [go] _with_ [a] few flowers [and] give [up] _on the_ vegetable garden 
A|36| A: [all] [right .] 
B|37| B: _but it_ _, it's_ interesting , listening [to] [them _.] i _think_ [,_ _i] [think_ the] social changes [in] [them] [, _i] think_ [i] [see] [it] more _with_ [that] generation [than i] [do] _with_ [like] _our_ generation . 
A|38| A: [i] bet 
B|39| B: [well [,] a] friend [of] mine had _, um ,_ [an] eel , 
A|40| A: [right _.] well , [we_ just] moved [down here] . [we] _used_ [to] _live_ _up in_ seattle [for] [a] couple [of] [years] . 
B|41| B: [right , and] [that] becomes difficult [then] . 
A|42| A: [right .] 
B|43| B: [on your] friends _, that's_ _true_ _, that's_ _true_ [. well , we] [have] [so] [many] unexpected things come [up] [so] often _it seems_ _with_ [, we] both [have] older cars [and] something _will_ come _up and_ wind [up] _having_ [to spend] [a] thousand dollars [, you know ,] _on the_ [car] [in] [two] months [or] something , 
A|44| A: [so] . 
B|45| B: [and so] _it seems like_ [it's] _always_ [used] as [a] bedroom . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _um [,_ you know _,] it_ may prevent somebody who [was] , [was] teetering _on the_ edge [of] experimenting [or] whatnot [but] [, uh , i] [don't] [know] [if] [, you know _,] the _,_ it's_ _, it's_ [a] needs [of] [the] few [and] [the] needs [of] [the] [many] [type] situation [i] [don't] [know] [if] everybody [should _have] to_ sacrifice [quite] as _much_ . [there] , there's [still] [a] big question [in] _my_ mind [that] _, the _,_ the_ absolute refusal [to] accept [the] possibility _of ,_ [of] mistakes _on the_ testing , [is] something [that] [still] bothers _me_ . 
A|48| A: [just] _her_ whole house [is] [like] _wow_ . 
B|49| B: [but] [, you know ,] _our_ [, like] _in our_ church _, it_ _, it_ [is ,] [your] free _to do_ [that] [or] [not] 
A|50| A: _uh-huh ,_ [right [.] i think] _pretty_ [much] [you] summed [up] _my ,_ _my ,_ [my] motivations also . 
B|51| B: [and] [they] plan [the] reunions _, the_ organize _the [,_ you know ,] who [is] _going to_ [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot _gets_ [there] , who's _going to_ rent [the] tables , who's _going to_ [see] [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware _gets_ turned _back_ [to the] caterer _. uh [,_ and] each [year] [it's] done [a little bit] differently _, because_ [different] _people_ serve [in] _those_ roles . 
A|52| A: [uh , i] _would_ _say_ [the] majority [of] [it's] happening _during [the_ day] [, uh [,] between] [probably] [ten] [in the] morning [and] _three_ [in the] afternoon . 
B|53| B: [not] getting [to] [go] . 
A|54| A: [i think] [it] [was] [just] rare [, i] _really_ [do] . 
B|55| B: [wow] _, that's_ great . 
A|56| A: [it] stays nice [and] fresh . 
B|57| B: you've _got_ [to] [see] _it ._ especially since _you have a_ german _, it_ [is] [so] cute . 
A|58| A: _yes_ . 
B|59| B: [oh] . huh . 
A|60| A: [i mean] [like] [going] [, um ,] forward [and] backward [a] word [or] [up and] [down] [a] line [that] [sort of] [thing] [just] [, you know ,] [didn't] match [with] [the] kinds [of] keys [, you] [were] using . 
B|61| B: [little] , [little] oak tree [that] [was] dead [, and] cut [it] [up and] split _it ._ 
A|62| A: _yeah ._ 
B|63| B: [okay] . [yes] [, i] [do] 
A|64| A: _so [,_ you] _are_ [kind of ,] half [way] acquainted [that] [way] . 
B|65| B: _i mean [,_ you know [,] i] remember [, well ,] [just] [the] things [that] [are] covered [. i] remember watching [the] world series [during the] earthquake [, and] [just] seeing [that] happen 
A|66| A: [and i] [just] _really_ , _really_ liked [the way] [he] writes . [it's] [just] , incredible . 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [and we] footed [the] bill [, because] [there was not] [any] [such] [thing] [and] _when_ [they] [were] young . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [right .] _yeah ._ 
B|71| B: [right .] 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [but [i] mean] [it] doesn't give [you] trouble ? 
A|74| A: [and so] _she_ asks _the same_ questions over [and] over _again_ . [which] [is not] [you know ,] unrealistic . 
B|75| B: [i] keep forgetting , _what_ , _what_ [she] named _him_ . 
A|76| A: _yeah ._ 
B|77| B: [well ,] [not] [so] [much] personally [but] [my [,] um ,] husband has [an] aunt who has _been_ [like] [a] second mother _, i mean_ _always_ lived [in [the] same] town [and] took _care_ [of] _him_ [and] [such] . [they] [live] [down] [in] college station [where ,] his _parents do_ [too] . [and] [they] _put_ [her] _in a_ home [last] [year] . 
A|78| A: [but] [very] [true] [to] life [, i mean ,] i've seen [our] _family_ [in] [several] [of] [those] situations 
B|79| B: [oh] . 
A|80| A: i've heard [all] these stories about [, i] travel extensively [and] [spend] [, uh ,] [maybe] half [a year] [in] europe _every_ [year] , 
B|81| B: [right .] [some] _people_ [, i mean ,] families [seem to] migrate towards _one ,_ _one_ room [and] carry [on] most [of] their activities [there] _, [and ,_ uh [,] uh ,] [some] rooms [, we] [have] _one_ room [that] [we] _never_ use . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] _it would be_ handy . 
B|85| B: [yes] 
A|86| A: [right [, and] [,] you know [,] we] _can't really_ depend [on the] police [to] solve [all] _this_ _, they_ [just] _can't_ _do [it_ .] 
B|87| B: "yeah _, that's_ [the] hard part [because] [when] [we] sit _down to_ make [it] [, we] try [to] make [it] real spartan [and] real narrow [so we] [can] _put_ [a] certain amount [in] savings [every] week [and then] [it's] [not] [really] [that] realistic [because] [we] [do] [find] [that] [we] [want to] [go and] [do] something [or] splurge [for] [, you know ,] birthday [for] somebody _or [,_ you know ,] even [we] [, we] even [do] things real frugally [for] [the] kids [, [we] get] [a] lot [of] toys [and] clothes [and] stuff at garage sales [or] from friends [because] [they don't] [know] [the] difference at [this] age [, you know ,] whether [they're] jordache new [or] whether [they're] *listen; ""because"" may start new utt unit [you know ,] something" 
A|88| A: [so] [the] [seven] [of] us went [on] [a] cruise [and then] went [to] disney together . [so] [that's] [all] [the] _family_ , [so] planning [our] _family_ reunion _was very_ easy [you know .] 
B|89| B: [uh-huh ,] [yeah .] 
A|90| A: no [how] [, [and] then] [, uh [,] the [,] he] [the] beagle died [in] _i guess_ about october [and] by christmas time [we] went [down [to] the] pound [and] [got] [him] [, uh , i] [or [,] i] humane society [and] [got] [, uh ,] [got] another [one [,] a] stray . 
B|91| B: _yeah [,_ well ,] [don't] even talk [to] _me_ [, _i] ,_ [when] [i] [was] single [i] had gone away [for] [the] weekend , 
A|92| A: [they] [really] [do] . [yeah .] 
B|93| B: [so] [i guess] [i] [can't really] [i] [can't] [say] _what_ [it would be] [like] [to [,] uh ,] grow [up _in] a_ [really] oppressed region 
A|94| A: [i'm] glad [my] husband's [not] _like [that_ .] 
B|95| B: [but] [, they] [would] _have [to_ be] supported [in] [some] [way] [, and] [i'm] [not] sure [that] [those] programs [are] available _to do_ [that .] 
A|96| A: [yeah ,] exactly . 
B|97| B: [yeah [.] oh [,] i] [see] _what_ you're saying . 
A|98| A: [so] . [yeah [,] it's] [kind of] scary [to] [think [,] you] [send your child to] school [and] [you] wonder [if] [he's] [going [to] get] shot [. [i] mean [,] [we] didn't [have] to] worry about [that] _before_ . 
B|99| B: [yeah [.] i] figured [for] [and] they've [just] raised [the [,] um ,] income caps [on] social security [to the] point [where] _you [have_ [to] be] [pretty] [, _you] [have_ [to] be] [pretty] [well] _off_ [before] [you] stop paying paying [that] as [well] . 
A|100| A: [uh-huh .] [it] [was] amazing [i] went [to the] [far] east [, uh ,] [back] [in] october [to do] [some] training [for] [t] [i] [and [i] ,] 
B|101| B: [that] [if] [the [,] the] laws [, and [,] and] [were] , [were] harsher [and] [were] enforced , 
A|102| A: [all] righty [. uh ,] i'll [just] _hand_ [it] [off] [to] [you] [and] hobbies [in our] spare time [is] [what] [we've] [been] selected [to] discuss today . 
B|103| B: [well] [here again] [we] [uh] even though [you] [uh] physically [you] agree _with me_ [you] [you] wouldn't [do it] yourself . 
A|104| A: anyway , [do] [you have a] pet ? 
B|105| B: [but] _they ,_ [they're] already [, uh ,] [have] [three] strikes against [them] [when] [they're] out [there] . 
A|106| A: [yeah .] [but] [they're] [not] doing bad . [people] [are] [pretty] surprised [that] [they [,] i mean] [they] beat [the] giants . 
B|107| B: [and it] helps [you feel] [a] strong sense [of] belonging . [my] husband , [on the] other [hand] , [was not] [very] close [to] his [family] . his [family] [was very] scattered [and] [very] diverse . 
A|108| A: [where] [are] [you] ? 
B|109| B: [he] had [some] accomplices [that] [were] [kind of] suspect [, and] [they [,] uh [,] they] broke [in] [one ,] [one] [night] [and] found [a] bunch [of] memos [that] [were] [, uh ,] supposedly from , from hughes [to [,] uh ,] [to] his main [, uh ,] main assistant [back] [, uh ,] [in the] fifties [and] [well [,] i guess ,] [in the] sixties , [up] until his death . 
A|110| A: [but [it] seems like] [here] [, i] [would] [like] [it] [to] rain [and then] [be] over [, [and] then] [not] rain [for] [a] while . [it seems like] [when] [it] [gets] stuck [in a] rain pattern [, that's] [all] [it] does . 
B|111| B: [so [,] i] [don't] [do] [that] anymore . [and] [the [,] the] recycling at georgia tech [, [like] that] [, uh ,] outside [the [,] uh ,] student center [they] _never_ empty [those] things . 
A|112| A: [but i] [always] [feel] [like] [i] [would] [never] [put] [my] [parents] [in] either [and i] wonder [, i'm] [going [to] be] [the] only sibling [that] isn't [going to] [have] children [so] [if] [my] [parents do] need [to] [live] [with] someone [, it] [will] [probably] [be] [with me] [because] [all] [my] brothers [and] sisters [will] [be] [having] teenagers around [and] everything [to] [care] [for] . [you know ,] 
B|113| B: [they're] [just] looking what's [going to] pay [the] biggest cash . 
A|114| A: [so] . [so [,] if] [we get] [what] [we] [what] [we] deserve
