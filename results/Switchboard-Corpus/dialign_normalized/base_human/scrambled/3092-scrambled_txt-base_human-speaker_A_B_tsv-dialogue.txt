B|7| B: _oh ,_ boy _, that's_ frustrating . 
A|8| A: [that's] [great] . 
B|9| B: [yeah _.] well_ _i think_ [in] large measure [the] reason [they don't] care _, it's not_ [because] [the] punishment _, but_ [so] many [of] [the] _people that_ commit crimes [don't] _get_ punished . 
A|10| A: _what ,_ _what_ _do_ [you] _do_ ? 
B|11| B: _yeah _,_ i _, i_ know_ [of] _some_ _people who_ _did_ [, uh _,] it was_ _, it was_ indirectly related _, you know _,_ they_ _could_ always _come_ up _with_ other reasons _but_ _it _,_ it_ _had _a_ lot_ [to] [do] _with_ _it ._ _just_ [the , the] whole attitude _, because it's_ _really [,_ uh _,] it's just_ _really _,_ _it_ _,_ it_ seems [so] t [i _,] you know ,_ _with_ [the , the] whole relaxed atmosphere _that _we_ _have_ _,_ um ,_ [to] [all] _of a_ sudden [, uh ,] search [for] attitudes [and] whatnot . 
A|12| A: [you know] cutworms will [do] [the] same _thing_ [to] [your] tomato vines _too_ . 
B|13| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: [and] [that] [was] [a] [great] _time_ [, because it's] _so [,_ that's] such [a] neat _place_ [and] _it's ,_ _there's_ _not a_ language barrier [so] [you] _don't [,_ i mean ,] _there_ _there's a_ _little_ bit [, because] _there's_ [some] [of] [those] english words [that] [you] [just] [don't] exactly [know] _what_ [they] [mean [,] and] _a lot of_ [people] [have] trouble wrestling [with] _their_ accents [, but] _it's [,_ it was] [really] fun _. i [, i_ , i] [really] enjoyed _that ._ _i'm_ _probably_ _going_ back _there_ [to] work , [for] [a] _year_ . 
B|15| B: [and] [so] [it's] almost impossible _to _,_ it's not_ fair [to] [a] pet _to _have_ a_ pet _here_ _, or_ _certainly_ _, certainly_ [not _a] dog_ , 
A|16| A: _what_ _about_ fast foods ? [do] _you have a_ preference _if you_ _were_ _going [to_ ,] eat [a] fast food ? 
B|17| B: _no _,_ [they_ don't] . 
A|18| A: [yeah ,] _did you_ _see_ sixty minutes last night ? 
B|19| B: _because , uh _,_ you know ,_ [that] [all] depends , _too ,_ _on_ _where_ [you] _are at_ _. that's_ [, uh ,] _sort of_ _interesting_ _to get_ opinions _as_ [to] _where_ different parts [of] [the] country _are_ .

A|20| A: [i think] [more] [people] _would do it_ _if_ [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|21| B: [did you] kill [the] deer ? 
A|22| A: [it was] [like] , 
B|23| B: _yeah . yeah ._ 
A|24| A: _but [,_ uh _,] but [,_ uh [,] certainly] before _that ,_ _there_ _were_ [people _that] [,_ you know ,] _would_ graduate from _high school and_ [could] barely read _. uh [,_ and] [that's] [just] [sort of] inexcusable _and you_ can't [really [,] i [, i] [, i] mean] [i] [just] can't [even] picture how [that] [could] happen _. [you_ know _,] except_ _maybe_ [to] someone whose [, you know ,] [really] badly learning [, uh ,] disabled [or] something . 
B|25| B: [uh ,] _yes_ [. i , i] try [to] grow [, uh [,] uh _,] a_ vegetable garden _and ,_ 
A|26| A: _about_ [, uh ,] [like] [you] _say_ , using _them _,_ our_ interest _there _is_ [,_ you know ,] _what_ profit [we] [could] make _off_ [of] any [kind of] relationship _with them ,_ 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] 
B|29| B: [so ,] five bedrooms [and] two living , two family 
A|30| A: [and [,] it] makes [, it] makes [it] _nice ._ [it] makes [, you know [,] _you] can_ _say_ classy [or] [it] makes _an_ elegant wedding [to have] something else . 
B|31| B: [so] [we] [use] [that] _one_ . 
A|32| A: _right_ , [in] [that] particular instance [, uh _,] but [i_ _,] but i _don't_ _,_ but [i_ know] [it's] _on a_ [and] [all] [and] _be_ [all] , 
B|33| B: [so] [what [,] you] try _to go_ [and] take [a] vacation every [year] [and] _go_ _out_ [and] camp ? 
A|34| A: [yes] [, _i [know] ,_ the] _one thing_ _that i think_ [is] [really] sad _about_ [it _,] as_ [i] recall , from [the] articles [that] _i've_ read , [is] _that if_ _, if_ [people who] [have] been _there ,_ [are] _going _to_ be_ killed _. um ,_ _there's_ [people that] [come] _to the_ prisons _and they're_ _very_ violent [and [,] they] want [, i mean] _they're_ anxious [for] someone _to be_ killed 
B|35| B: [they] [were] [just] covered [with them ,] 
A|36| A: [oh] . 
B|37| B: learned [about] [their] basketball team 
A|38| A: [and [,] uh ,] [what] [we] [did] [was _just] [,_ uh ,] decide how [we] [had] been spending _our_ money before , 
B|39| B: [yeah _,] we_ _, _we_ _have_ ,_ [that] [is [,] uh [,] as] [a] matter [of] fact [they] update [it] once [a] week [with] [a] special section _, we_ [, and] [we] pay [it] [sort of] glancing nod . [we] [, uh ,] [have a] [very] _good_ _friend_ [who] [is [,] uh ,] tapped _into_ [the] city planning structure [. uh [,] our] developer architect _friend_ [and ,] 
A|40| A: huh . 
B|41| B: _oh [,_ yeah .] 
A|42| A: [but] _you're_ _right_ [, it] [is] temporary [. _well] [,_ i] _see_ [that we] both share [the] same belief _here that_ [it's] _important_ [that we] spend _time_ [with] [our] kids 
B|43| B: [and] [we] choose [to] bring congealed salad [. [you] can] bring [a] congealed vegetable salad [, as] opposed [to] potato salad . 
A|44| A: [oh] . 
B|45| B: [and] she'd [just] lay [there] [on] [that] step [and] [just [,] you know ,] cool [off] 
A|46| A: [but] he [is] [the] lovingest cat . everybody , [people who] [don't] [even] [like] cats , [like] _him_ . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh] _, [a lot_ of] women [do] [. um ,] [i've] [just] _never_ [really [,] you know ,] [maybe] [one] [of] [these] _days_ i'll _have _to_ get_ _out_ [there] [and] mow [, but _,] um _,_ my husband_ takes [it] [on] [, and] i'll _help_ rake up [the] grass _, and _,_ um ,_ sometimes i'll _help_ [him] edge _, um [,_ _because] _,_ we_ [don't] [have] [that] much property [, but] _we're_ [on a] corner [lot] _, so_ [there's [a] lot of] edging [to] [do] 
A|48| A: [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [do] [your] own _thing [._ yeah .] 
A|50| A: [um ,] [was] [it] [a] _home_ [that] you've [had] [for] quite [a] few years [, or] [that] you've , 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: [oh ,] [well] [that's] [interesting] . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [good] point . we've got _enough_ without without [a] passport [there's] plenty . 
B|55| B: _yeah , that's_ [, you know _,] just_ minor . [just] minor [little] ball [here] [or] [there [,] you know] . 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: _right ._ 
A|58| A: [right .] 
B|59| B: [yeah _,] we_ [don't _,] we_ [don't _,] um ,_ [use] aluminum cans , 
A|60| A: [yeah [.] [i] think] _one thing_ [that] [maybe] _would_ [help] [people] vote [is] _if_ [the] polls [were] either open [more] [days] [, or] [you] [could] mail [it] [in] [, or] something [like] _, _if you_ [have_ _,] _if you_ have_ _real_ strict work hours _, and [you_ can] only [go] [like] [at] seven [in] [the] morning [or] after work _and _you_ have to_ stand [in] line [for] [so] long 
B|61| B: [yeah [,] yeah .] 
A|62| A: _but i_ [do] [, i] [do] _think _that_ , uh [,_ i mean ,] public education [in] general [i think] [can] work _. _and_ [i_ think _it's] a_ [good] [thing .] 
B|63| B: [and] [they] liked [that [.] and] _then_ [on] [the] way [home] [we] drove by [the] local [high school and] [there] happened [to be] [an] f _a ,_ f [a] _a ,_ future f _a ,_ future farmers [of] america , f f [a] [going] [on] [there ,] 
A|64| A: [you can] walk [a dog] [and] [that's] _okay_ [for] weekend [but] cats [are] [good] [all] [the] _time_ . 
B|65| B: [because] [a lot of] [time] nowadays , [even] _though_ [you're] working [, uh ,] [you're] treated _, and it_ may [not] [be] true [in] every _place ._ _in [a_ lot of] cases [i think] [you're] treated [more] [like] [a] number instead _of a _,_ a_ person . 
A|66| A: [oh [,] so] he , 
B|67| B: [oh [,] that's] pretty [good] . 
A|68| A: [i mean , i] couldn't believe [that] _she_ couldn't [think] [of] any [place .] [they] said [, the ,] apparently [the] [crime] , [is [,] [just] [,] uh ,] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [so [,] you know [,] it's [just] ,] 
B|71| B: [i mean] [you have to] set [an] example [. [you] have to] start somewhere . 
A|72| A: exactly [. [i] think] [our] community _is [a_ lot] [more] conscious now [though] [too [,] [and ,] and] [that's] [good] [too] . 
B|73| B: wow _. _that's_ nice _._ that's_ [real] [nice .] 
A|74| A: _i'm_ sure [it] [is [,] yeah .] 
B|75| B: _no [,_ i] haven't [, i know] [that , uh _,] my_ sister [, i] [have a] twin sister [and] _when they_ graduated [she] _went_ [to [,] uh ,] teach _in a_ small _town_ _down_ [in] south _texas_ [and [i] know ,] [that] [like] [if you have] college notes [, if you] teach _in a_ lower income bracket _where [they_ don't] pay [as] much [and] [they] cancel _part_ [of] [your] [, you know ,] [your] college note [or] whatever . 
A|76| A: [oh ,] [oh] . 
B|77| B: [and] _my_ in-laws also [have] [one] [, [and] they're] almost [as] close . 
A|78| A: _they [,_ _they] [,_ just] started trying [to get] [them ,] something together [like] , [like] [that] around [here] from , _for ,_ from [the] community [because , uh [,] we] [had a] big ice storm [uh ,] [very] , [very] recently . 
B|79| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [what] [part] , [what] sections [are] [they] [in] ? [yeah , [that's] nice .] 
B|81| B: [so] [they [,] uh [,] [it's] _a] [,_ [it's] a] whole different [, uh ,] [kind of] [thing] [there] _then_ [, uh ,] 
A|82| A: [the] [texas] rangers [, [they] [,] they] lost [, i think] . 
B|83| B: [uh-huh] 
A|84| A: [well] [my husband] [is] telling me [we [have] to] hit [the] road [we're] _going [to_ go] [to] commerce [and] _see_ [a] [friend] [. [and] ,] [then] _i'm_ _going [to_ go] [to] sulphur springs . 
B|85| B: [yeah [,] except] [for] [time] [in] service . 
A|86| A: [no ,] [they're] [just] mutts , 
B|87| B: [um] . 
A|88| A: look professional 
B|89| B: [um ,] 
A|90| A: _uh , she_ enjoys mowing [. i] can't believe [it .] 
B|91| B: [so] you'd , you'd rather [see] [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
A|92| A: [so [,] my husband] [and i] love [to go] _to the_ musicals [when they] [come] [into] [town] [into] dallas .

B|99| B: [yeah .] actually , [i'm] [a] california born person . 
A|100| A: [right] [, yeah .] 
B|101| B: [well ,] _down_ [here] [with] [the] peace corps [we're] talking [about] [all these] [people that] aren't [even] [in] [our] own country [when] [there's] [enough] [people] [here [that] i think] [probably] need [help] [and ,] [could] [be] helped . 
A|102| A: [yeah . yeah [.] that's] [kind [of] a ,] let [down] . 
B|103| B: [and] [my] mom has [to] take care [of] her pretty much [so] [it] gets [, [i] don't] [know] . _it's , [it's_ a] hard decision [, but i don't] [think] [i] [would do it] [to] [my] parents personally 
A|104| A: [well ,] [no [,] and] [it's [, it's] just] [not] [, um [,] it's not] [as] stable [for] [the] kids ,

A|114| A: [uh [,] i think] [that's] [about] [where] [it] [is] . 
B|115| B: [but ,] [one thing] [, i [think] [that] if] [there [is] a] chance [for] rehabilitation [then] [that] chance should [be] investigated . 
A|116| A: [uh-huh .] i'd [never] heard [them] before until [i] [went] [in a] music store [and [you] know] how [you put] [the] headphones [on] [and] listen [to] [it]
