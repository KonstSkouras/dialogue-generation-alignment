B|7| B: [oh] boy [that's] frustrating . 
A|8| A: [that's] [great] . 
B|9| B: [yeah _.] well _i_ think_ [in] large measure [the] reason [they don't] care _it's not_ [because] [the] punishment _but_ [so] many [of] [the] _people that_ commit crimes [don't] _get_ punished . 
A|10| A: _what_ _what_ _do_ [you] _do_ ? 
B|11| B: [yeah] _i _i_ know_ [of] _some_ _people who_ _did_ [uh] _it _was_ _it_ was_ indirectly related _you know_ [they] _could_ always _come_ up _with_ other reasons _but_ _it_ _it_ _had _a_ lot_ [to] [do] _with_ _it ._ _just_ [the the] whole attitude _because it's_ _really_ [uh] _it's just_ _really_ _it_ _it_ seems [so] t [i] _you know_ _with_ [the the] whole relaxed atmosphere _that _we_ have_ _um_ [to] [all] _of a_ sudden [uh] search [for] attitudes [and] whatnot . 
A|12| A: [you know] cutworms will [do] [the] same _thing_ [to] [your] tomato vines _too_ . 
B|13| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: [and] [that] [was] [a] [great] _time_ [because it's] [so] [that's] such [a] neat _place_ [and] [it's] _there's_ _not a_ language barrier [so] [you] [don't] [i mean] _there_ _there's a_ _little_ bit [because] _there's_ [some] [of] [those] english words [that] [you] [just] [don't] exactly [know] _what_ [they] [mean] [and] _a lot of_ [people] [have] trouble wrestling [with] _their_ accents [but] [it's] [it was] [really] fun _. i [i_ i] [really] enjoyed _that ._ _i'm_ _probably_ _going_ back _there_ [to] work [for] [a] _year_ .

B|21| B: [did you] kill [the] deer ? 
A|22| A: [it was] [like] 
B|23| B: _yeah . yeah ._ 
A|24| A: [but] [uh] [but] [uh] [certainly] before [that] _there_ _were_ [people that] [you know] _would_ graduate from _high school _and_ could_ barely read _. uh_ [and] [that's] [just] [sort of] inexcusable _and you_ can't [really] [i [i] [i] mean i] [just] can't [even] picture how [that] [could] happen _. [you_ know] _except_ _maybe_ [to] someone whose [you know] [really] badly learning [uh] disabled [or] something . 
B|25| B: [uh] _yes_ [. i i] try [to] grow [uh] [uh] [a] vegetable garden [and] 
A|26| A: _about_ [uh] [like] [you] _say_ using _them_ _our_ interest _there is_ [you know] _what_ profit [we] [could] make _off_ [of] any [kind of] relationship _with them_ 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: [uh-huh [.] yeah .] 
B|29| B: [so] five bedrooms [and] two living two family 
A|30| A: [and it] makes [it] makes [it] _nice ._ [it] makes [you know] _you can_ _say_ classy [or] [it] makes _an_ elegant wedding [to have] something else . 
B|31| B: [so] [we] [use] [that] _one_ . 
A|32| A: _right_ [in] [that] particular instance [uh] _but i_ _but i don't_ _but [i_ know] [it's] _on a_ [and] [all] [and] _be_ [all] 
B|33| B: [so] [what] [you] try _to go_ [and] take [a] vacation every [year] [and] _go_ _out_ [and] camp ? 
A|34| A: [yes] [i [know] the] _one thing_ _that i think_ [is] [really] sad _about_ [it] [as] [i] recall from [the] articles [that] _i've_ read [is] _that if_ _if_ [people who] [have] been _there_ [are] _going _to_ be_ killed _. um_ _there's_ [people that] [come] _to the_ prisons _and they're_ _very_ violent _and they_ want [i mean] _they're_ anxious [for] someone _to be_ killed 
B|35| B: [they] [were] [just] covered [with them] 
A|36| A: [oh] . 
B|37| B: learned [about] [their] basketball team 
A|38| A: [and] [uh] [what] [we] [did] [was just] [uh] decide how [we] [had] been spending _our_ money before 
B|39| B: [yeah] [we] _we have_ [that] [is] [uh] [as] [a] matter [of] fact [they] update [it] once [a] week [with] [a] special section [we] [and] [we] pay [it] [sort of] glancing nod . [we] [uh] [have a] [very] _good_ _friend_ [who] [is] [uh] tapped _into_ [the] city planning structure [. uh] [our] developer architect _friend_ [and] 
A|40| A: huh . 
B|41| B: [oh] [yeah .] 
A|42| A: [but] _you're_ _right_ [it] [is] temporary [. well i] _see_ [that we] both share [the] same belief _here that_ [it's] _important_ [that we] spend _time_ [with] [our] kids 
B|43| B: [and] [we] choose [to] bring congealed salad [. [you] can] bring [a] congealed vegetable salad [as] opposed [to] potato salad . 
A|44| A: [oh] . 
B|45| B: [and] she'd [just] lay [there] [on] [that] step [and] [just] [you know] cool [off] 
A|46| A: [but] he [is] [the] lovingest cat . everybody [people who] [don't] [even] [like] cats [like] _him_ . 
B|47| B: [uh-huh] [a lot of] women [do] [. um] [i've] [just] _never_ [really] [you know] [maybe] [one] [of] [these] _days_ i'll _have _to_ get_ _out_ [there] [and] mow [but] [um] _my husband_ takes [it] _on and_ i'll _help_ rake up [the] grass [and] [um] sometimes i'll _help_ [him] edge [um] [because] [we] [don't] [have] [that] much property [but] _we're_ [on a] corner [lot] [so] [there's [a] lot of] edging [to] [do] 
A|48| A: [yeah .] 
B|49| B: [do] [your] own _thing [._ yeah .] 
A|50| A: [um] [was it] [a] _home_ [that] you've [had] [for] quite [a] few years [or] [that] you've 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: [oh] [well] [that's] [interesting] . 
B|53| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [good] point . we've got _enough_ without without [a] passport [there's] plenty . 
B|55| B: _yeah that's_ [you know] [just] minor . [just] minor [little] ball [here] [or] [there] [you know] . 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: _right ._ 
A|58| A: [right .] 
B|59| B: [yeah] [we] [don't] [we] [don't] [um] [use] aluminum cans 
A|60| A: [yeah [.] [i] think] _one thing_ [that] [maybe] _would_ [help] [people] vote [is] _if_ [the] polls [were] either open [more] [days] [or] [you] [could] mail [it] [in] [or] something _like if you have_ _if you have_ _real_ strict work hours _and [you_ can] only [go] [like] [at] seven [in] [the] morning [or] after work _and _you_ have to_ stand [in] line [for] [so] long 
B|61| B: [yeah] [yeah .] 
A|62| A: _but i_ [do] [i] [do] _think _that_ uh_ [i mean] public education [in] general [i think] [can] work _. _and_ [i_ think _it's] a_ [good] [thing .] 
B|63| B: [and they] liked [that _.] and then_ [on] [the] way [home] [we] drove by [the] local [high school and] [there] happened [to be] [an] f [a] f [a] [a] future f [a] future farmers [of] america f f [a] [going] [on] [there] 
A|64| A: [you can] walk [a dog] [and] [that's] _okay_ [for] weekend [but] cats [are] [good] [all] [the] _time_ . 
B|65| B: [because] [a lot of] [time] nowadays [even] _though_ [you're] working [uh] [you're] treated [and it] may [not] [be] true [in] every _place ._ _in [a_ lot of] cases [i think] [you're] treated [more] [like] [a] number instead _of a_ [a] person . 
A|66| A: [oh] [so] he 
B|67| B: [oh] [that's] pretty [good] . 
A|68| A: [i mean i] couldn't believe [that] _she_ couldn't [think] [of] any [place .] [they] said [the] apparently [the] [crime] [is] [just] [uh] 
B|69| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [so] [you know] [it's just] 
B|71| B: [i mean] [you have to] set [an] example [. [you] have to] start somewhere . 
A|72| A: exactly [. [i] think] [our] community _is [a_ lot] [more] conscious now [though] [too] [and and] [that's] [good] [too] . 
B|73| B: wow _. _that's_ nice _._ that's_ [real] [nice .] 
A|74| A: _i'm_ sure [it] [is] [yeah .]

A|102| A: [yeah . yeah [.] that's] [kind [of] a] let [down] . 
B|103| B: [and] [my] mom has [to] take care [of] her pretty much [so] [it] gets [i don't] [know] . _it's [it's_ a] hard decision [but i don't] [think] [i] [would do it] [to] [my] parents personally 
A|104| A: [well] [no] [and] [it's [it's] just] [not] [um] [it's not] [as] stable [for] [the] kids
