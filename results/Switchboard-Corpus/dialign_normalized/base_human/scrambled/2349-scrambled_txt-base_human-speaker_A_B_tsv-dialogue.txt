A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: [well] [they] range [from] let's _see_ [about [a] year] [and] [a] half [to] nine [years] old .

A|58| A: [um] [it] filled [a lot of] people try [to] _stay_ away _from this_ [but i] make [my] [own] homemade pudding _just _because_ _i don't_ like_ box pudding . 
B|59| B: [yeah] [and] [and] also [um] [the] [the] _thing_ [i don't like] [about a lot of] these court trials [and] [a lot of] these appeals [is that] [it's] [not] based [on] [what] [is] true [and] [what] [is] false [but] rather [it's] [on] [the] rules [of] evidence [what] [can] [i] hide [and] [what] [do] _i _have_ to_ tell .

A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [that's] _right_ [but] [you can't] take [this] [money] with us [though] 
B|67| B: [so] [that] works [out] [to] [be] [um] [a] reasonable [a] reasonable benefit . 
A|68| A: [or] [maybe] [you] [don't like] [the] person [you] [have to] [you] [would] want [to] carpool with [that] kind [of] [thing] [so] [it's it's] kind [of] [a] [thing] [where] [uh [i] think] [the] majority _of the_ people [do] [not] carpool .

[my] comment [on] [this] [is that] [we] paid [an] absolute fortune [over the] [years] for [a] variety [of] opportunities . 
A|72| A: yes [we] [do] . 
B|73| B: [yeah] [well] he's he's [out] for cardboard .

A|78| A: bye-bye . 
B|79| B: [no] cracked slab [or] [anything] [like] [that] ? 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .]

B|85| B: [and] 
A|86| A: [what] degree [i mean] [what] [are] [you] [wanting to] [do] after [you] [get] [out of] college ? 
B|87| B: [uh-huh uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [but] [uh] [yeah] [but [i] mean] [a] [a] [a lot of] people [would] [get] involved [and] [you know [because] there] [were] [all] [different] organizations [to] [do] . [there] [was] big [brother] big sister 
B|89| B: [and] [they] final [get] [up] [to] [where] [they] kill somebody else [and] [they go] through fourteen appeals [and] [how] many hundreds [of] thousands [of] taxpayer dollars . 
B|90| B: [i don't] [know] [how] [much] [i] [know] [about] [this] subject
