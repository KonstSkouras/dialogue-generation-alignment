A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: [well] [they] range [from] , let's _see_ [about [a] year] [and] [a] half [to] nine [years] old .

A|58| A: [um ,] [it] filled _, [a_ lot of] people try [to] _stay_ away _from this_ [but i] make [my] [own] homemade pudding _just _because_ _i don't_ like_ box pudding . 
B|59| B: [yeah [,] and [,] and] also [, um [,] [the] [,] the] _thing_ [i don't like] [about a lot of] these court trials [and] [a lot of] these appeals [is that] [it's] [not] based [on] [what] [is] true [and] [what] [is] false [but] rather [it's] [on] [the] rules [of] evidence _, what_ [can] [i] hide [and] [what] [do] _i _have_ to_ tell . 
A|60| A: wow . [um ,] [do] [the] skunk [, uh ,] [was] [it] kind [of] [like a] cat [to have] [around] [the] house ?

B|63| B: [uh ,] _where_ [i] live [now] _it's , it's_ [not] [so] bad [. _i] mean_ [i] [can] [basically] leave [my] front door unlocked [and] [not] _have to_ worry [about] [it] [. uh _,] [but_ [i] do] [have] friends [that] live [in the] city [and _i] think_ [that they] [get [a] lot of] fallout [from this] war [on] drug _thing_ [. uh ,] [just _because] there_ _are_ , [like ,] crack houses [, you know ,] [on] their street [and] stuff [like] [this] . 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [that's] _right_ [, but] [you can't] take [this] [money] with us [, though] 
B|67| B: [so] _, that_ works [out] [to] [be] [, um [,] a] reasonable [, a] reasonable benefit . 
A|68| A: [or] [maybe] [you] [don't like] [the] person [you] [have to] [, you] [would] want [to] carpool with [, that] kind [of] [thing] [, so] [it's , it's] kind [of] [a] [thing] [where] [, uh [, i] think] [the] majority _of the_ people [do] [not] carpool . 
B|69| B: [right [.] [right] .] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .]

[my] comment [on] [this] [is that] [we] paid [an] absolute fortune [over the] [years] for [a] variety [of] opportunities . 
A|72| A: yes , [we] [do] . 
B|73| B: [yeah [,] well ,] he's , he's [out] for cardboard .

A|76| A: [well , [i] have] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|77| B: [so] [that] [is] [why] [we] [you know] play [over] [there] cause [we] [have] [got our] card 
A|78| A: bye-bye . 
B|79| B: [no] cracked slab [or] [anything] [like] [that] ? 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [yeah , i] tape [it] [because i don't] [stay] [up] [that] late [to] watch [it ,] 
A|82| A: [i] [see] . 
B|83| B: [well [, i] , i really] choose restaurants [more] for [the] quality [of] food [than] [anything] else . 
A|84| A: [the] legend [. uh] . 
B|85| B: [and] 
A|86| A: [what] degree [, [i] mean [,] what] [are] [you] [wanting to] [do] after [you] [get] [out of] college ? 
B|87| B: [uh-huh , uh-huh .] [yeah .] 
A|88| A: [but] [, uh ,] [yeah [,] but] [, [i] mean [,] a] [, a] [, [a] lot of] people [would] [get] involved [and [,] [you know ,] [because] there] [were] [all] [different] , organizations [to] [do] . [there] [was] big [brother] , big sister , 
B|89| B: [and] [they] final [get] [up] [to] [where] [they] kill somebody else [, and] [they go] through fourteen appeals [, and] [how] many hundreds [of] thousands [of] taxpayer dollars . 
B|90| B: [i don't] [know] [how] [much] [i] [know] [about] [this] subject
