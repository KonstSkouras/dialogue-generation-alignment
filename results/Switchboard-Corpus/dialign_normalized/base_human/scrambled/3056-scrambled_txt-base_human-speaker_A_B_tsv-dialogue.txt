B|45| B: _yes ._ 
A|46| A: [i] mean , dallas [is a] very marked [up] area , although [right] [now] [it's] [a lot] lower [um _,] because_ [of] [all the] layoffs [and] everything 
B|47| B: [oh _,] the_ potato [, they were] _, they're_ delicious [but] [they] [, you] [don't] [get] , seem [to] [get that] _much_ [for] [the] space , 
A|48| A: [yes [.] uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [and] [so] we've [got] plenty [of] _time_ [to] go [, because] _down_ _here in_ houston [, it's] [, uh _,] the_ lines [are] long . 
A|50| A: [of] course , when [they] [get] caught _then_ _they're [,_ you know [,] they're] guilty [of] course [, [but ,] uh ,] during [that] [time] [i'm] [sure] there's hundreds [of [,] uh ,] thousands [of] _people_ [that] [are] [, uh ,] spending money [that] [does] [not] belong [to] _them _._ _so_ ,_ 
B|51| B: [oh ,] catfish [is] wonderful .

[if you] [get] [a] rainy [season] [and] [you] happen [to] [be] camping _then_ [it] [can] [be] [kind of] bad . 
B|63| B: [uh ,] [what] i've gotten [into] [more] recently [are the] tools [to] [use] [them .] [have] [you] , 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .]

A|66| A: [oh [,] really] ? 
B|67| B: [yeah .]
