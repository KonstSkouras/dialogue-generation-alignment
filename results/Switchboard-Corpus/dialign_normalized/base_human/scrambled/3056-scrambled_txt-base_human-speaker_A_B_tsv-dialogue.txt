B|39| B: [and] dogs take _a lot_ [of] _a lot_ [more] care than cats [do .] cats [are] pretty independent [you know] [you] feed [them] [and they] keep themselves clean [and] _if you_ _if you_ raise [them] [right] [you know] [you] [don't] [have] [to] worry about [the] litter box _thing_ where [with] dogs [you] [really] [do] [have] [to] let [them] out [and] take [them] [for] walks [and] things like [that] . 
A|40| A: [we] [we] originally [lived] [in] dallas [and] [we] met [and] _got_ married 
B|41| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: _so_ 
B|43| B: _yeah ._ 
A|44| A: [i] mean [well] [they] _are the_ _people_ whose strings [are] pulled [and] by [i] guess powerful 
B|45| B: _yes ._ 
A|46| A: [i] mean dallas [is a] very marked [up] area although [right] [now] [it's] [a lot] lower [um] [because] [of] [all the] layoffs [and] everything 
B|47| B: [oh] [the] potato [they were] [they're] delicious [but] [they] [you] [don't] [get] seem [to] [get that] _much_ [for] [the] space 
A|48| A: [yes [.] uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [and] [so] we've [got] plenty [of] _time_ [to] go [because] _down_ _here in_ houston [it's] [uh] [the] lines [are] long . 
A|50| A: [of] course when [they] [get] caught _then_ [they're] [you know] [they're] guilty [of] course [but uh] during [that] [time] [i'm] [sure] there's hundreds [of] [uh] thousands [of] _people_ [that] [are] [uh] spending money [that] [does] [not] belong [to] _them _._ so_ 
B|51| B: [oh] catfish [is] wonderful .

A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [and] [there] [would be] like thirty [people] [. so] [people] talk about [you know] [big] family reunions [and] [i think] like [i [have] a] friend who [just] went [to] like wyoming [to] [some] [big] ranch [you know] where like [there] [were] four [hundred] [people] [for] [their] family reunion . 
A|60| A: [it] gives [you] confidence .

[if you] [get] [a] rainy [season [and] you] happen [to] [be] camping _then_ [it] [can] [be] [kind of] bad .

A|66| A: [oh] [really] ? 
B|67| B: [yeah .] 
A|68| A: [yeah .]
