B|57| B: [uh _,] it_ has _around_ thirty-two hundred square feet . [uh ,] five bedrooms [and] [so] forth [and] [so] _on_ , 
A|58| A: [we] [are] [real] glad [we] got together [because] since _that _,_ that_ time [there] _were_ only [like] two [of [the] ,] [one] sister [and] [one] sister-in-law [of the] original [family] left [.

B|59| B: [that's] [right .] 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [so] [i guess] _it's_ supposed [to] [be] dinner party , [is] [that] _what_ [they] said ? 
A|62| A: [uh _,] very_ good . 
B|63| B: [i] [see] him _out_ [there] , 
A|64| A: [uh-huh] , [yeah .] 
B|65| B: [we] [were] using baby food [and] [there] [was] [so many] baby food jars , kind [of] _what_ started [it .] 
A|66| A: [yes _,] they_ will . 
B|67| B: _they'll_ help [you ,] _recycle_ [, because] [we] , [there] [is] [some] bins [, like] behind wal-mart [, that] _take_ [some] things . 
A|68| A: [no _,] it's_ [like] [, i] _just [,_ i don't] [know [,] [i] , i] _just_ _never_ understood why , [what] [the] attraction [, i] mean , [they're] [, you know ,] [they're] pretty [and] everything [but] i've _just_ _never_ seen [the] attraction [of] having fish . [it's] [not] [as] much fun . 
B|69| B: [that's ,] 
A|70| A: [my] husband likes pepsi [and] [those] cans [are] steel instead [of] aluminum [, so] [we] can't , can't ever [recycle] [them .] _i think_ [it's] [a] good reason [to] quit buying [it .] 
B|71| B: [of] course . 
A|72| A: [well] actually [, i] play [, i] play [the] violin [in] _, [in_ a] string quartet [that] often plays [at] weddings . 
B|73| B: [right .] 
A|74| A: [uh [,] that] [was] _about_ [a] year [and] [a] half _ago_ [, _and] ,_ 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: _so [,_ i] [have] [, _uh ,] i_ [have] [, _uh ,] i_ [have] children boy scout age . 
B|77| B: [and] [so many people] [when] [they] put [people] [in] [the] nurses [home [,] they] [never] [see] [them .] 
A|78| A: [are _you] a_ summer [person] ? 
B|79| B: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [uh ,] [yes [,] that's] [out] near [the] airport [. that's] _about_ forty-five miles [from] [us .] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [yeah ,] instead [of] something greasy [or] , 
B|83| B: [they] [, they] [, that] [just] does [not] _go_ . 
A|84| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [you] want [you] want [a] nincompoop jury [because] _they'll_ sympathize [with] [you a] bit [as well] [as] hopefully being honest [people] [and] do [their] best [to] comply _with the_ facts [as] [they] [were] presented [to [them] .] 
A|86| A: [he] came [to the] conclusion , plastics [is] actually [one] [of the] biggest problems [in] landfills cause _it's , it's_ low weight [, but] [it's] high volume _so it_ takes [up] [a lot] [of] space 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [but] usually sometimes every _few_ summers . [well ,] [all] , [see] , [all] [the] [family] lives [in] once place , except [for] _a few_ [of us] [are] scattered _about_ . 
B|89| B: [and] [home] porting [was] [a] possibility [a few] [years ago .] 
A|90| A: [sure [.] uh-huh .] [sure .] 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [oh ,] _okay [._ [oh] ,] _okay ._ _okay [._ [oh] , well [,] it] sounds [like] [you're] pretty much [into] computers . 
B|93| B: [okay .] 
A|94| A: [but] , unemployment now [in] dallas , [or] [in texas] [is] [up] [around] six point , 
B|95| B: [yeah ,] [he] [just ,] [he] couldn't [get] [up] , [he] couldn't walk [, so ,] [he] [was] [a] hundred [and] twenty pounds [, [so] _it] was_ [a] chore . 
A|96| A: [and] [they] haven't [, you know ,] talked _about_ doing something [like that] 
B|97| B: [but] 
A|98| A: [uh-huh [.] [oh] ,] [yeah .] 
B|99| B: [well _, i] think_ [they're] [a] necessary evil . [uh , i] wish [the] government _would_ operate _on_ _the same_ premise [that [,] uh ,] businesses operate _on_ [and] [that] [is] [, uh] [you [,] you] [don't] [spend more] than [you ,] than [you] bring [in] . 
A|100| A: [well] [and] [it's] [the] first step [in] _, in_ actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing _and [,_ and] aging . 
B|101| B: [yes .] [yes [,] so] [have] [we] been [very] [, very] fortunate . 
A|102| A: somebody , somebody abandoned her _and ,_ she's only _about_ [, [oh] ,] between six [and] eight , six [to] eight weeks old 
B|103| B: [and [,] um [,] and] [that's ,] 
A|104| A: [so _,] it's_ difficult [, [it] really] [is] [and] _we're_ [all] heading [that] [way] [and ,] 
B|105| B: [and the] man said [, [that] , you know [,] if] [it] weren't [for] [the] fact _that he_ _would_ _go_ [to] jail [, _that] he_ _would_ eliminate [this] [person] himself [. _and] then go_ [to] mcdonalds [and have a] hamburger [and] [not] [thing] [a] [thing ,] [think] [a] [thing] [about] [it .] 
A|106| A: [uh ,] [okay .] 
B|107| B: [but] [not] worth [it .] 
A|108| A: [uh [,] so [,] [uh ,] [i] would say] [that's] probably [their] prime motivation . [they'll] , [they'll] stock your [house] [and [,] uh ,] look [at] your pattern [and then go] [from] _there ._ 
B|109| B: there's should [be] [, you know ,] [this] , [for] [this] crime , [this] [is] [the] penalty . [you] killed , someone [you know [,] in] cold blood [or] whatever . 
A|110| A: [and then] [you] end [up] [with [the] same] [problem] [and you] [take] [their] leftover medicine [, that's not] allowed . 
B|111| B: bye-bye . 
A|112| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [oh] . 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] [sure .] [would] [, it] [would] [, it] [would] [be] [just] futile . 
B|115| B: [yeah [,] because] [we] [don't] miss [it] [, we] [really] [don't] , [when] [it's] [just] taking [out] [of the] paycheck [and] stuff [, so] . [but] [we're] trying [to] put [a] little [money] away [for] [the] kids [because] [we can] envision [the [,] uh ,] expenses [for] college already [, you know ,] eighteen [years] away [or] whatever . 
A|116| A: [and ,] [yes ,] [you're] _right [,_ i think] [it's] [a] sixties program . [i think] [it was] [one] [of] kennedy's [hot] points [that he] [, that] [was] [his] big [deal] . 
B|117| B: [right [,] [it's] , [it's] , it's] [just] south [of] [there .] 
A|118| A: [yeah [,] [they] get] [out] [in] three [years] [on] probation ,
