A|22| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|23| B: _you're_ , _you're_ [making] _me_ hungry _here ._ 
A|24| A: _oh _._ _that's_ really_ nice [to] [know [,] because] [we] _were_ _doing_ [the] same _thing ._ [because] _to take_ _it_ _to a_ metco [, you] [have _to] take_ _it_ _when_ _they're_ open [, you know _,] which is_ always [a] _real_ pain .

A|26| A: [and] [when] [we] _got_ back [to] dallas _it_ seemed [really] dry [because] _it's_ [kind of] _like_ [what] [you're] used [to] . _but i_ agree [with] _you _,_ the_ humidity , especially [for] curly heads _like_ [me] . 
B|27| B: _sure ._

B|43| B: [well ,] _not_ necessarily 
A|44| A: [yeah , [that's] true .] _but_ _but , uh [, i_ think _,] i mean_ even _more_ [than] _that ,_ even _, i mean_ [if] [you] drop _out in_ high school [you] should _still_ _be_ able [to] read [you know] ? _which_ _it_ _i mean_ _it_ _sounds _like_ , uh ,_

A|50| A: [well] [well ,] _who_ , _who_ _else_ [is] _going [to_ do] _this_ [, then] ? 
B|51| B: [i think] _in [and_ _it] ,_ [just] _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances [and _,] and_ [the] extent _of the_ abuse [and _,] and_ [if] another alternative _was_ available . 
A|52| A: [that's right .]

A|54| A: [i] _know ._ 
B|55| B: [oh ,] goodness . [you] [get] [so] attached [to] _them ._ 
A|56| A: [i] wonder [how] long [it's] _going to be_ [on] [for] .

A|80| A: [okay [.] [i] think] _i did_ [know] _that _,_ i just_ forgot . [okay .] 
B|81| B: _because i_ _finally_ asked [because] _, you know [, we_ had] _all of_ those _milk_ cartons _and there_ [was] nowhere [else] [to take] [them] _and _they_ had_ [it] [in] front [of] wal-mart [and] [i] ask [in] wal-mart _and they_ said [they] moved _it just_ behind . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [uh] 
A|84| A: [yeah .] 
B|85| B: [it] _is [,_ and] [that's] why [we] _decided_ [to] build . [we] looked _at_ _things_ [that] [were] already [, uh ,] built 
A|86| A: he [, uh ,] _um ,_ _last_ [i] heard , he [, uh ,] he beat [a] push [for] [the] death penalty . now whether [they] [finally] _got_ [it] _or_ _not [,_ i] _don't_ _know ._ 
B|87| B: [okay] _, well_ [we] [are] [in] south garland _, but_ [yeah ,] next [time] [you] [go] _, uh , you know ,_ check [into] _it _,_ they_ [have [,] uh [,] it] [is] [just] [like , uh [,] a] bus card _and [they_ just] punch [it] . [you know [,] it] has [got] [one] through _ten_ [on] _it and_ every [time] [you] [go] [they just] punch [it] [for] [you] . 
A|88| A: [and] [we] ended [up] [with] [them] [, right .] _and so_ [we] [were] , walking [up] 
B|89| B: _it's _,_ it's_ phenomenal . [it's] phenomenal [, the] programming [, the] human operating system , 
A|90| A: [uh-huh [.] well ,] _our_ [home] [is [,] uh ,] probably [, for] _our_ area [it's] probably [one] [of the] lower income homes _out_ [here .] [uh ,] _most_ [of [the] , the] homes [that] [they're] building [, [well ,] i] shouldn't _say_ [all of] [them] [, but] _most_ [of] [them] now [are] [up] _in the_ millions [of] dollars . 
B|91| B: [but] [it's] [just] [, _it] just_ [was] [not] [and] [you] [get] stung [a] [time] [or] _two_ , 
A|92| A: [i had] [a] friend [in] [i had] [a] friend [in] college _who_ [had] _a ,_ _um ,_ [had] [a] pet rat [for] [a] while . 
B|93| B: what's [that] ? 
A|94| A: [right .] 
B|95| B: _it's _,_ it's_ [real] easy [, i] [like] [doing] [that] part . 
A|96| A: tell [me] [what] [you] [like] [to do] . 
B|97| B: [um [,] so] [that's] , [that] [kind of] helps [out in] terms _of , you know ,_ keeping up-to-date [with] contacts [in] industry . 
A|98| A: [uh [,] in] dallas there's definitely [a] crime [problem [,] i] [know] [it's [,] you know ,] worse _in the_ larger cities . [um [,] it's] [kind of] [a] concern [for [me] [,] in] fact , [at] [the] moment [i'm] thinking [of] possibly moving _to a_ new apartment [and , uh [,] [it's] [,] i] am single [and] female [, you] definitely [are [going] to] worry [about] [the] location [, and [, uh ,] you know ,] accessibility _of people_ [to be] able [to] break [in] [. i live] _on a_ third floor now [, _but] [,_ i , you know ,] [i'm] [real] concerned [that] [i [,] i] _don't_ [want] [to be] _on a_ [first] floor [where] [you] [can] [have] problems [with] [things] [like] _that [,_ and [,] [the] ,] [um ,] 
B|99| B: [oh .] 
A|100| A: [uh-huh] , [or] [if] [somebody] gets sick . [yeah ,] [or] [if] [somebody] gets sick [, and] _it's [not_ the] [other] person [and they] [want] [to] [go] [home] [, and] [that] [one] person's [got] _the car_ [then] [they're] , [they're] stuck , 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] [oh , [you] [,] [you] [,] you] [don't] plan [on] putting _any_ , _any_ [of] [that] [in] ? 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [yeah [.] that's] neat . 
A|104| A: [well ,] [how] [do] [you ,] [how] [do] [you] feel [about] [, uh ,] companies drug testing prior [to] hiring ? 
B|105| B: [right .] 
A|106| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [five] bedrooms _. uh-huh ._ 
A|108| A: [and , [uh ,] yeah] [i was] amazed . [really] [good] temperament [and] [very] playful [and] affectionate [, good] personality [. i] [don't] [know , i] can't imagine [what] [, uh ,] [would] [have] _been_ wrong [with] [this] [dog] [, so] . 
B|109| B: [they] _, they_ charged [you] by , by weight [of] [how much] trash [you] [were] actually sending [to a] land fill . 
A|110| A: [it's] enough space [for] [two] _people_ [yeah .] 
B|111| B: her eyes [are] changing , 
A|112| A: [the] [one] [in] florida [is] [so] cool [because] [they] pick [up] [everything] . [they] pick [up] newspapers [and [, uh ,] you know ,] [milk] jugs [and] aluminum [and] tin cans [, you know ,] [like] soup comes [in and] stuff . 
B|113| B: [have] [you] seen [, uh ,] canine [. the] movie [, oh ,] 
A|114| A: [uh-huh .] [because _i] guess_ [because] [of the] changes [in] eastern europe [, uh ,] they've increased funding [for] [the] peace corps . [some] [of [the] _,] i guess it's_ [some] [of the] peace dividend _in the_ _sense [,_ you] known , 
B|115| B: _it's like_ [i] [say] [, [it's] not] [a lot] [, but] [it] helps [people] . [like] [this] [last] couple [we] helped [, you know _,] they_ [were] [in] [their] eighties [and] _she was_ bedridden [and [,] i just] [, you know ,] [just] tears [your] heart [out] [to] [to see] [this] [kind of] [thing] 
A|116| A: [yeah [.] well ,] [she] stayed , [she] stayed [in a] temporary nursing [home] . until [she was] [okay .] 
B|117| B: [oh ,] [really ?] 
A|118| A: [okay [.] well ,] [how] [do] [you] feel [about] [, uh ,] drug testing ? 
B|119| B: [but] [it's [not] ,] 
A|120| A: [yeah [,] the] cheese fondue [i] make , _some people_ [like] swiss , [um [,] i] prefer cheddar . [and] i'll mix [, i] won't make [, i] won't _have a_ sharp cheddar [because] [it [,] for] fondue [i think] [it] should _be a_ little calmer [than] [real] sharp , cheddar . 
B|121| B: [and] [um [,] [that's] really] [what] makes [the] [most] [sense [,] because] [you] [don't] [have to] use [so] [much] water [, and] 
A|122| A: [oh ,] [sure .] 
B|123| B: [yeah [,] uh _,] of course [,_ i] [like] gadgets [and [,] and , uh ,] fun [things] , [on] [the] cars [, which] [are] [all] [the] [things] , _course [,_ the] 
A|124| A: [and] spanish [is] [a lot] [like] english . 
B|125| B: [well ,] [sounds like] [our] husbands [have] similar interests . 
A|126| A: [and] [it's] worth [it and] [it's like] [ten] dollars [a] day [or] something [and] its worth [it just] [to] keep everyone [else] away [from] badgering [you] 
B|127| B: [yes] , absolutely . 
A|128| A: [i] [really] [think [,] i think ,] [um ,] [people] [, you] should [, i , you know [,] the] kids today [i] teach [, i] spend [a lot of] [my] [time] teaching college students 
B|129| B: [right .] 
A|130| A: [right [,] okay .] 
B|131| B: [right [,] [yeah] .] 
A|132| A: [yeah [,] yeah] 
B|133| B: [then] [she was] starting [to get] [, uh , you know ,] lose memory sometimes [and [,] which is] [kind of] frightening [when] [she's] [in [the] car] . 
A|134| A: [right .] 
B|135| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|136| A: [and , uh [,] so] [they] come [here] [and they] [don't] [know] [what] [the] heck [they're] [doing] . [and] [they're] finding themselves adrift [in the] big cities . [and [,] of course [,] there are] [people] [in the] big cities _who_ [would] [do ,] [like] nothing [better] [than] [to take] advantage [of] [them .] 
B|137| B: [and [it] [,] [it] ,] [to] [me [,] it] gives [me] [more] [, a lot] [more] control [in] snow [and] ice [and] slick conditions . 
A|138| A: [and , uh [,] [they] had] basically [decided] [that] [there] [is] [going _to be] a_ [real] [problem] [here] within [a] few years [on] solid waste . 
B|139| B: over [the] uncooked rice ? 
A|140| A: [is] [that] suppose [to be] . 
B|141| B: [and [,] i think ,] [that] [they could] [get] [some] results [from] [that [,] because] [there are] [a lot [of] people] [who] [are] volunteer [and] community minded , 
A|142| A: potato salad [and , uh ,] 
B|143| B: [and ,] [on [a] [,] a] scale [, i guess it's] [still] considered [small] . [it [just] [have] [a] lot of] different laboratories . 
A|144| A: [our] major [crimes] [in] [our] immediate town [, uh [,] is] probably robberies , house robberies [and] [very] few instances [of , you know ,] alcohol , drugs [, uh ,] reported . 
B|145| B: [and , uh ,] granted [some [people] need] [to be] compensated [if] [they] [have] [really] [been] wronged [, you know .] 
A|146| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|147| B: [and so] [it] wasn't [so] bad . 
A|148| A: [and there] [really] [are] criminals [that are] hard-core [and ,] repeat [, and] never [have] [any] chance [for] , 
B|149| B: _it's a_ wonderful [, it's] wonderful [to be a] mother [but , uh , i] [like] [i] [like] [the] way [i did] [it] . 
A|150| A: [yeah [,] [it's] [,] you know [,] [it's] a] pain [to] clean [but [,] you know , we] used [to [,] i mean] [, they] [got] great stuff [out] now [for] cleaning cats' pans . [they] didn't , 
B|151| B: [okay .] 
A|152| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] [right .] 
B|153| B: [uh ,] anything
