A|24| A: [gosh] , small world , huh ? 
B|25| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [yeah .] _we're_ doing [some] _here_ [in [,] in] cash valley [, the] community _here ._ 
B|27| B: [i _think] that_ should [be] left _up_ [to] [people] [who] [have] [some] knowledge [in the] subject [and] more knowledge [than] [a] jury [would] [have] . you're talking [about] [, the] person's already [been] _found_ guilty , _right_ 
A|28| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [yeah ,] i've done [it] [before] [and] _when i_ _was in_ [in] high _school_ [and] _college_ [, and] thoroughly enjoyed _it ,_ 
B|31| B: [yeah _,] it is_ [a] tough question . 
A|32| A: _yeah , and_ he's [got] [, you know ,] seven brothers [and] sisters _and , [and_ , uh ,] he's _the one_ [because] he's _the one_ [that] _isn't_ _going to_ work every _day_ _and _that_ she_ moved [in] _with_ [when she] needed _to move_ [in] _with_ someone _. [and_ ,] 
B|33| B: _oh ,_ wow . [that] [is] [really] interesting . _are you_ saying [to] _use_ [like] _, um ,_ [for] chocolate [like] , unsweetened , 
A|34| A: _right ._ [they] _don't_ [have] [one of those] _. so [,_ _it] [,_ we] decided _that was_ _it [,_ you know [,] [and] [,] _i] mean ,_ _everybody_ calls us [and] wants [to] _give_ us [a] credit card _. [we have_ [,] _we] could_ [have] credit cards running down [our] ears . 
B|35| B: [yeah [, and] just] _kind of_ relaxed [and] unwound _a little bit_ _, from_ [our] daily routine . 
A|36| A: [yeah ,] [where] [are you] ? 
B|37| B: [yeah] if [you] implemented [a] flat percentage [, [it] would] encourage [people [,] uh _,] to_ _make_ more money [and] [the ,] what [people] need [to] understand [in] [my] opinion , [now] [this] [is] [just] [my] opinion , okay [, uh ,] [is] [that] businesses create jobs [and] jobs create income [and] income pays taxes . 
A|38| A: [oh ,] [see] _, _i'm_ not_ _, uh , _i'm_ not_ [a] dog _person_ _at_ [all] 
B|39| B: [and , [and] that] _way_ [we] [can] [be] _sure [,_ you know [,] we] [can] find out [the] truth [, we] [can] find out what [really] happened [and , and] base [the] sentence [on] what [the] [person] _did_ [, not] [on] what [we're] allowed [to] let [the] jury hear 
A|40| A: _no ,_ your [, i] _have a_ friend [now] [that] _has_ seven _. [and_ , um [,] and] they're [all] eight [and] under [, and] nine [and] under , 
B|41| B: [yeah .] [it was] [a ,] landmark [is] [the one] [who] built [it .] 
A|42| A: [and [i] think] [that's] [the one] [night] [that we] [really] try [to] [watch] television . 
B|43| B: [i'm] [going to] _get_ another [one] as soon as [i] _get_ back [in] town . [i'm] [going] out [of] town [this] weekend , [when i] _get_ back [i'm] [going to] find [a] cat [. so ,] 
A|44| A: [yeah _,] it's kind of_ [like] [in] louisiana [where] [that [,] uh ,] guy [that's] _like a_ ku klux klan member something [got] elected . 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [it] [sure] beats dragging hoses [around] . 
B|47| B: _and so_ [we] [used to] [just] save [them] _up_ [and] [then] they'd [come] [around] [and] we'd [give] [them] [to] [them .] 
A|48| A: [just] hadn't [heard] much [about] [them] lately . 
B|49| B: [yeah _,] [yeah_ ,] [well] [i , i] went [to] [dallas] [, uh ,] [when i] _worked for_ t [i] [in] abilene [and [, uh ,] i'm] _a little_ familiar [with] [the] city area , forest lane [and [,] you know ,] through [that ,] off , off [the] freeway . 
A|50| A: [that [,] that's] _real good_ . 
B|51| B: [right] , [or] what you've [heard] [on] t v , _which_ [i think] [is] [just] outrageous . 
A|52| A: [you] go [in] _their_ bathroom [and] there's [ten] tooth brushes [in] [there] _. [and_ i] always [give] [her] [a] hard [time] whose toothbrush [did] _you really_ [use] [this] morning 
B|53| B: chapel hill [is] [kind of] [a , a] ritzy city [or] whatever [. [i] mean [,] it's kind [of] [,] i'm] [, i'm] [sure] [there] [is] problems [with] [it ,] [but] [it] [has] [a] _pretty_ low crime rate . compare , compared _to _, to_ ,_ durham [has] probably [got] [the] worst . they've [had] [like] forty-eight murders since [the] beginning [of] [the] year . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh [.] uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [it's] [been] denied fortunately [but ,] 
A|56| A: [you know] [my] husband's always [got] [it] [on] . 
B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [no [,] i don't] [think] [there] [was] . [um [,] i know] _a little bit_ more _from_ [a , a] co-worker . [her] mother-in-law [had] [been] [in] [for] quite [some] [time] [and] [had] [different] degrees [of] [a] place [that she] [was in] . 
A|60| A: [you know [,] [and] so [,] it's [,] it [is] [,] uh , _we] could_ [not] do without [the] benefit package [from] [, from] _any_ company [that we] [worked for] , whether [they] [be] [a] conglomerate [or] [just] [a] small [, uh , uh ,] business . 
B|61| B: [yeah] [we] , [two] year old daughter [in] child care [and] [we] went through [the] process [of] searching [for] child care [and] [uh ,] finding what [we] consider [to be] , [real good] child care [at] [a _,] uh , pretty_ reasonable price [, we] [think] . 
A|62| A: yes . 
B|63| B: [uh ,] last year [when] [they] passed [the] tax laws [for [the] [,] uh ,] nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one [uh , i] added _up_ [all] [the] taxes [that we] were [going _to] pay_ [on] [all] these [different] specific luxury items [and] _travel_ expenses [and] everything else , 
A|64| A: [oh] . 
B|65| B: [um .] 
A|66| A: [that's] [real] _nice ._ 
B|67| B: [i mean] [it] sounds [like a] train [. we have] wooden floors [and so] _it just_ [sort of] echoes through [the] house 
A|68| A: [yeah .] [no] . *aa 
B|69| B: [but] [they] talk [about] [things that] [i [,] my] brother didn't talk [about] until [he] [was in] [college] [you know ,] 
A|70| A: [they had] [a] yearly auction [, they had] [a] dance marathon [for] charity [or] [, [to ,] to] support [that ,] [group] . 
B|71| B: [yeah [,] my] name's bill [. well ,] 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [yeah .] 
A|74| A: [is] [it _,] that's good_ . 
B|75| B: what does [that] house [got] attraction ? 
A|76| A: [oh] [i] wouldn't [either] . there'd [be] [no] [way] . 
B|77| B: [i think] [so [,] and] [a lot [,] i think] [people] [are] , [are] [used to] [now] saying what's , what's [on] [their] minds more more _up_ front [than] [they] [used to [be] .] 
A|78| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [right] , [right] , [right [.] _and] [you_ really] [have] [to] _make_ [, uh ,] quite [a] _bit_ [of] money . [the] wife _doesn't make_ [it] worth [it ,] [with] [the] cost [of] day-care . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: recently 
B|83| B: [isn't] [that] [nice [.] [i] mean] [it's] [nice] [when] [you] [have a] piece [that ,] [that] [is] [so [,] so] peaceful , [that] [everybody] likes [, you know ,] 
A|84| A: snow , 
B|85| B: [oh [,] that's good] , _too ._ 
A|86| A: [uh-huh [.] and] [now] [the] red lobster [i] [found] [is] very [nice] [at] lunchtime . 
B|87| B: [um [,] that's] possible [i] guess . 
A|88| A: [you] [think that] [that's] [, uh , pretty] adequate coverage [and _you] get_ [. uh-huh .] [it's] historic events , huh . 
B|89| B: nevertheless [you] maintain [that] [it's] [it is] [the] [right] [of] [of] [any] citizen [to] burn [the] symbol [of] [their] country . 
A|90| A: hopefully , 
B|91| B: [uh-huh] [yeah .] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh _.] _but_ [i_ heard] [that] most homes [that] do participate [in] [that] [are] having [to pay] [a] monthly fee [to] do [that] . [which] [, [uh [,] i] don't] [know [,] [it] just] [doesn't make] sense [to] [me] . 
B|93| B: [and] [i'm] okay [. but] [when] [it] [gets] _too_ hot [, then] [it's ,] [that [,] i don't] [like] [that] 
A|94| A: [that's] [so] stupid [that] [you] [all] [have] [two] teams . 
B|95| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [my] [, _my] daughter's_ [in [the] [,] um ,] [fourth] grade 
B|97| B: [that was] [my daughter's] brownie leader telling [me] [that] [there] [is] [a] meeting tomorrow brownie meeting . 
A|98| A: [sure ,] [sure] [. so ,] 
B|99| B: [so] [we] [thought] maybe [we could] [get] [them] [to move] _a little_ closer [here .] 
A|100| A: [uh ,] [we're] [going to] go [for a] conference [in] september [and so ,] hopefully , we'll [get] [to] [travel] [a little bit] [too .] 
B|101| B: [but [i] really] figure [right] [when] [it] becomes [really] popular [that] [it's] [going [to] be] ruined . 
A|102| A: [oh ,] do [they] [really .] curbside pick [up] ? 
B|103| B: basically [be] [me] working [to pay] [for] [them] [to be] [at] [a] [day] care , center . 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: ri- , exactly . 
A|106| A: [and , uh ,] 
B|107| B: [well] [i'm not] talking [about] [just] [in the] [school] system .
