A|4| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|5| B: _that's_ absolutely _right ._ _it _,_ _it_ [,_ _uh ,] i_ guess _it_ _all_ comes down _to [,_ uh _,] you know _,_ a_ _, a_ definition [of] [, uh ,] _how_ _much_ _out_ , outside activities affect your _work_ _and , uh [,_ uh ,] granted _, _you know ,_ that ,_ any , any [kind of] _drug_ use _on_ , _on_ _company_ property [and] whatnot _, is , is_ definitely _not_ acceptable . 
A|6| A: [uh-huh] _, there's_ _a lot_ _, yeah ,_ _lot of_ hidden taxes . 
B|7| B: _yeah ._ 
A|8| A: _yeah _. i_ think_ _it's_ _a little_ harsh [to] _say_ [that] _they_ _should_ _have to_ spend [a] year _or_ _two_ . 
B|9| B: _i've_ never _been_ _over_ _impressed_ _with_ _him_ .

B|15| B: [i _think] they_ compare _you know ,_ _fairly_ _well_ . 
A|16| A: _so_ _those_ _are the_ real killers . _if_ _he's_ _just_ gone , 
B|17| B: _well [,_ what] [, what] _it_ _will_ _be_ _, you_ _just _,_ you_ drive _up_ _on_ [the] jack _, but _you_ _,_ it_ won't _go_ down . 
A|18| A: [and , uh ,] _here_ _in_ maryland _i know_ _we_ _have a_ real problem [with] overcrowding _in_ _prisons_ [, uh ,] [just ,] 
B|19| B: _you know , _if_ you_ _want to_ _be_ [a] lawyer _because_ _you know_ _that you_ _can_ provide [a] service _that people_ need _because_ [you [have] to] [have] lawyers [in] _this_ country _, _um ,_ but_ [if] you're [just] doing _it_ _because_ _you think_ [that's] [the] best _way_ _to ,_ _be_ rich . 
A|20| A: [that's] [right _.] that's_ [right _.] _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ takes _a lot of_ room . 
B|21| B: _huh_ , stick shift , _huh_ ? 
A|22| A: [well [,] [you know ,] if] [, _if] _they_ have_ time _enough_ [they] [can] , stay _off_ [of] _it ._ 
B|23| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _i mean we_ used [to] _pay ,_ _pay_ fifty cents an hour [to] baby-sit _. but_ mine _are_ twenty-two , twenty-three [and] twenty-seven _so_ [you know , that ,] 
B|25| B: _there_ probably [are] [, you know ,] _for but_ [i'm] [sure] [, that's] probably _like_ _people_ [that] _do _that_ are_ , [are the] _people_ _that are going_ _to go_ into social _work_ [and] stuff [but] [i think] _that it_ wouldn't _really_ _be_ half bad [for] everybody _not_ _to do something_ [, _you know ,] and_ realize [it's] everybody's responsibility _to _,_ um ,_ help these _people [,_ _you know ,] and_ _i'm not_ _saying_ [just] _give_ _them_ _money_ _but _,_ i mean ,_ _because_ [they [have] to] _be_ taught [to] _be_ , 
A|26| A: [and] [and] both [of] [them] [are] both [want] [the] extent [of] extremes _so_ [that] _they don't_ [give] anything [for] [a] balance [you know] _there's_ _there's_ always [that] difficulty 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and , uh ,] _so_ _we_ [have] watched [that] 
B|29| B: _oh ,_ [yes] _, or_ _they _, i_ agree _with_ the_ freedom _of the_ press [, _you know ,] and_ _all the_ amendments _, but_ sometimes [it's] [for] [the] public's own [good] _that we don't_ hear _things ._ 
A|30| A: _oh ._ 
B|31| B: [i know] [they] _lost_ [, yeah _,] to_ washington [and] philadelphia . 
A|32| A: [well ,] i'll keep [that] _one_ [in] mind . 
B|33| B: [yes] _, uh-huh ._ 
A|34| A: [yes] . 
B|35| B: [yeah [.] that's] _pretty_ [good .] 
A|36| A: [and] [we] got _a few_ [, you know _,] we_ put [up] _some_ hummingbird feeders [and] _some_ bird feeders . 
B|37| B: [right .] 
A|38| A: [kind of] _see_ [what] happens . 
B|39| B: _really ?_ 
A|40| A: [that's] true . [a] [a] big hole _does_ exist [right] _now [,_ uh ,] [in] [that] consumers [can] [just] _say_ [oh _, i] , i_ forgot _that ._ _there ,_ _there is_ _no_ [well] defined mechanism _at_ [all] [and _,] and [that_ _it] _is_ a_ [a] loss _. _i_ _, _i_ think_ _is_ that_ [the] federal government [will] try [to] establish [a] mechanism [just] [to do] [just] [that] [in] [in] order [to] gain [the] revenue [that's] _being_ [lost] . [uh [, i] mean _,] _i , i_ don't know_ [if] [i agree with] _that _._ but_ [it [,] [but] ,] 
B|41| B: _actually_ [it] [was] _more_ fun _than_ [you] _would_ [think] . [yeah ,] starting _from the_ beginning [but _,] um [,_ yeah [,] we] live , [also] live _in the_ city [now _,] actually_ [in] manhattan . 
A|42| A: [of] course [, uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [but] [we] did [, we] _really_ truly did [pay] [a] fortune _. [i mean_ we] _were_ paying [at] [one] point _, well_ _about_ , _about_ [a] , close , _about_ five hundred dollars [a] week [for] [two] _children_ . 
A|44| A: [you know] _what i'm_ [saying] ? [that we _don't] have_ [, uh [,] well] _a lot of_ states _don't have_ capital punishment . 
B|45| B: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: _no_ [, _i] haven't_ . _have you_ ? 
B|47| B: [and] [it] _would be_ [just ,] 
A|48| A: _uh , my_ [more] exciting spots [have] [been] , [i've] [been] [to] [the] galapagos islands . 
B|49| B: [yeah [,] yeah _,] you ,_ [it's] , _it's hard_ sometimes [at] _work_ _because_ [, you know ,] _people_ [say] , [oh ,] _we're_ taking [a] cruise , _we're_ _going_ _here ,_ _we're_ _going_ [there [,] you know] _because_ [they [have] [a] lot] [more] _money_ . 
A|50| A: _so [,_ that [,] and] _my_ husband [and] son [go] camping [with] scouts mostly . 
B|51| B: [i've] never _actually ,_ never _actually_ played [it [.] [but] ,] 
A|52| A: [oh , yeah .] 
B|53| B: [yeah ,] _because_ when _people_ can't [pay ,] [they] end [up] _going_ [to] clinics _or _,_ you know , to_ public hospitals [, and that] [kind of] thing _, and [,_ you know ,] 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] [, yeah [,] i agree with] [you] _very_ [much] _so ._ [now [,] we] waited several years before [we] started _having_ [children] [because] [we] [was] still [in] college [, and] [we] knew time wise _, or [,_ and] [money] wise , _too_ 
B|55| B: [i'm] [, [uh ,] my] father _had_ [a] software _company_ , 
A|56| A: [yeah] 
B|57| B: [right .] [right .] [we] froze [a lot of] peppers . [we] let [some] turn red . 
A|58| A: [and , uh] [you know , and] _so_ [the] students [were] [, you know , to] [some] extent , motivated [to] learn . 
B|59| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [um ,] september [really] [was] , [i'm not] [sure] [about] october _. i think_ [for] [about] twelve months through september _the _,_ the_ average temperature has [been] higher [than] normal each month . [um ,] lots [of] ninety degree days during [the] summer . 
B|61| B: [yeah ,] _how_ old [is] she ? 
A|62| A: [i mean ,] either [way] [there] [was] family reunion time [, or] [not] , 
B|63| B: [that is] [not] breed standard . 
A|64| A: [yeah _.] it's_ [the] same [with] [my] husband cause _he's_ got [pretty] flexible hours [if] , _as_ _long_ _as_ _he_ puts [in the] hours _he_ needs _to do ._ worked [out] [really] [well] [for] us _too_ . 
B|65| B: nobody came near [it] when [he] [was] [there] . 
A|66| A: [well [,] that's] [good .] 
B|67| B: _then_ _would_ [you] condone [the] burning _of the_ capitol building ? 
A|68| A: [and] [then] [, [actually] ,] after [there] [i] went [to] [um ,] hawaii [, [a] lot of] [my] travel has [been] sort [of] based around conferences [or] business meetings 
B|69| B: [sure .] insurance [should] [pay] [for] [that .] 
A|70| A: [and] [you ,] [there] [were] [some] places , where [people ,] 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] [you] [really] aren't isolated [because] [it's] [, the] advantages , your home [is] far [enough] away [that] you're [not] bothered [by] [being] [too] close [to] [people ,] 
A|72| A: _uh-huh . [oh_ [,] that's] great . _long_ _as_ [it's] [not] raining . 
B|73| B: [oh ,] close [to] five minutes [, i] believe . 
A|74| A: [yeah [,] i] [was] [kind of] surprised [how] rapidly [they] bypassed [, the] three eighty-six . [that] wasn't alive [for but] _maybe_ [two] years . 
B|75| B: [so] [what] [do you] guys [having] [up] [there] ? [i haven't] [been] [up] [there] since , [oh ,] lord , forty-eight [, i] guess 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [if you] [had] [to do something] [like] [that ,] day after day . 
B|79| B: [i] [really] _don't think_ [so .] [yeah . i] [really] [don't] [because] , [some] [people] _are going_ _to ,_ [are] , _are going_ [to] risk [it _,] um _,_ it_ _may_ prevent [, i , i] guess [, i] guess [what i'm] trying _to get_ [at] _is [,_ if] [it [,] if] [it [,] if] [it] [does] help [a few] individuals [maybe] , [maybe] [it's] worth [it .] 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [i think] [one] _of the_ problems [with] , [with] education [as] [it] relates [to] _this_ , though _, is that_ [i don't know] [that] education [is] prepared [to] help [people] make [those] changes . _it just_ seems [a lot _of] the_ training [and] education [that] goes _on_ [is] gearing [people] towards [a] profession [and] [not] giving [them] [the] skills [and] whatever [those] skills [are] necessary [to] make [those] job changes , which [i think is] _going_ [to] _be_ [a] _hard_ thing [for] , [for] [people] [to] face . 
A|82| A: [um , but] [he] [had] [actually] [was] able [to get] [him] [over] [that .] 
B|83| B: [it is] . [it] [really] [is] . 
A|84| A: [oh] [yeah _,] there's_ , 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [the] recycling program [here] [is] [just] terrible [. i mean] [it's hard] [to] find places [to go] [. [i mean] ,] kroger [does] [a] couple [things .] [they [, i] [don't] [think] [they] ,] [do] [they] [do] newspapers ? 
B|87| B: [okay _,] he's [,_ uh [,] uh ,] south [of] renner _on_ , _on_ custer . [and] [there [is] [a] little] bitty mall [that] looks [kind of] _like [,_ or ,] strip [kind of] center . 
A|88| A: _very_ comfortable , [so .] 
B|89| B: [they] [really] [are] . [the] cats [are] [so] independent [and] [they have] [so] [much] [more] personality [than] [a] dog . 
A|90| A: [of] course [not] . 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [well [,] you [,] [you] think] [it's] _better_ [than] [to [,] to] try [to] spread _the [,_ the] effort equally among [all the] employees [of the] [company] [or ,] 
B|93| B: [uh-huh . [oh] .] 
A|94| A: [yeah .] 
B|95| B: drive cars [with] catalytic converters [, and] [all] [that [.] it's] interesting . [they're] , [they're] looking _at [,_ there's] [some] _work_ [being] _done_ _on_ [, uh ,] automobiles _that are_ electrical powered 
A|96| A: [really ?] 
B|97| B: [yeah .] [as] far [as] [yeah ,] getting doctors [and] [all] [that] stuff [, yeah .]

B|107| B: [it's] [it's] [very] easy [to do .] 
A|108| A: isn't [that] [a] shame . 
B|109| B: [so ,] _we're_ getting [a] large [oh ,] gosh [, i don't [know] [,] i think] [there's] [like] twenty-six [different] languages [now [,] _that] are_ spoken [in] [i [,] the] [i] s d . [dallas] innercity school district . 
A|110| A: [uh .] [well] [is] [there] anything else [that you] look [for] [or ,]

[off] earlier . 
A|122| A: [right] , exactly [. _i] , i don't_ [, [the] [,] i think] almost [the] [only] [way] [that] [drug] testing [can] [be] [done] [fairly] [is] [if] [it's] across [the] board [from] , [from the] janitors [to] [the] executive management .
