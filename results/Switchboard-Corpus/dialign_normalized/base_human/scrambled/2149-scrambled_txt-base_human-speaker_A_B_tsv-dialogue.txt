A|16| A: _so_ _those_ _are the_ real killers . _if_ _he's_ _just_ gone 
B|17| B: _well_ [what] [what] _it_ _will_ _be_ [you] [just] [you] drive _up_ _on_ [the] jack _but you_ _it_ won't _go_ down . 
A|18| A: [and uh] _here_ _in_ maryland _i know_ _we_ _have a_ real problem [with] overcrowding _in_ _prisons_ [uh] [just] 
B|19| B: _you know _if_ you_ _want to_ _be_ [a] lawyer _because_ _you know _that_ you_ _can_ provide [a] service _that people_ need _because_ [you [have] to] [have] lawyers [in] _this_ country _um but_ [if] you're [just] doing _it_ _because_ _you think_ [that's] [the] best _way_ [to] _be_ rich . 
A|20| A: [that's] [right _.] that's_ [right _.] _uh-huh ._ uh-huh ._ takes _a lot of_ room . 
B|21| B: _huh_ stick shift _huh_ ? 
A|22| A: [well] [you know if] _if _they_ have_ time _enough_ [they] [can] stay _off_ [of] _it ._ 
B|23| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _i mean we_ used [to] _pay_ _pay_ fifty cents an hour [to] baby-sit _. but_ mine _are_ twenty-two twenty-three [and] twenty-seven _so_ [you know that] 
B|25| B: _there_ probably [are] [you know] _for but_ [i'm] [sure] [that's] probably _like_ _people_ [that] _do _that_ are_ [are the] _people_ _that are going_ _to go_ into social _work_ [and] stuff [but] [i think] _that it_ wouldn't _really_ _be_ half bad [for] everybody _not_ _to do something_ _you know and_ realize [it's] everybody's responsibility _to um_ help these _people_ _you know and_ _i'm not_ _saying_ [just] _give_ _them_ _money_ [but] [i mean] _because_ [they [have] to] _be_ taught [to] _be_ 
A|26| A: [and] [and] both [of] [them] [are] both [want] [the] extent [of] extremes _so_ [that] _they don't_ [give] anything [for] [a] balance [you know] _there's_ _there's_ always [that] difficulty 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [and uh] _so_ _we_ [have] watched [that] 
B|29| B: _oh_ [yes] [or] _they _i_ agree _with_ the_ freedom _of the_ press _you know and_ _all the_ amendments [but] sometimes [it's] [for] [the] public's own [good] _that we don't_ hear _things ._ 
A|30| A: _oh ._ 
B|31| B: [i know] [they] _lost_ [yeah] [to] washington [and] philadelphia . 
A|32| A: [well] i'll keep [that] _one_ [in] mind . 
B|33| B: [yes] [uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [yes] . 
B|35| B: [yeah [.] that's] _pretty_ [good .] 
A|36| A: [and] [we] got _a few_ [you know] [we] put [up] _some_ hummingbird feeders [and] _some_ bird feeders . 
B|37| B: [right .] 
A|38| A: [kind of] _see_ [what] happens . 
B|39| B: _really ?_ 
A|40| A: [that's] true . [a a] big hole _does_ exist [right] _now_ [uh] [in] [that] consumers [can] [just] _say [oh_ _i] i_ forgot _that ._ [there] _there is_ _no_ [well] defined mechanism _at_ [all] [and] _and [that_ _it] _is_ [a_ a] loss _. _i_ _i_ think _is_ that_ [the] federal government [will] try [to] establish [a] mechanism [just] [to do] [just] [that] [in] [in] order [to] gain [the] revenue [that's] _being_ [lost] . [uh [i] mean] _i i don't [know_ if] [i agree with] _that _._ but_ [it] [but] 
B|41| B: _actually_ [it] [was] _more_ fun _than_ [you] _would_ [think] . [yeah] starting _from the_ beginning [but] _um_ [yeah] [we] live [also] live _in the_ city [now] _actually_ [in] manhattan . 
A|42| A: [of] course [uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [but] [we] did [we] _really_ truly did [pay] [a] fortune _. [i mean_ we] _were_ paying [at] [one] point [well] _about_ _about_ [a] close _about_ five hundred dollars [a] week [for] [two] _children_ . 
A|44| A: [you know] _what i'm_ [saying] ? [that we _don't] have_ [uh] [well] _a lot of_ states _don't have_ capital punishment . 
B|45| B: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: _no_ _i haven't_ . _have you_ ? 
B|47| B: [and] [it] _would be_ [just] 
A|48| A: _uh my_ [more] exciting spots [have] [been] [i've] [been] [to] [the] galapagos islands . 
B|49| B: [yeah] [yeah] [you] [it's] _it's hard_ sometimes [at] _work_ _because_ [you know] _people_ [say oh] _we're_ taking [a] cruise _we're_ _going_ [here] _we're_ _going_ [there] [you know] _because_ [they [have] [a] lot] [more] _money_ . 
A|50| A: _so_ [that] [and] _my_ husband [and] son [go] camping [with] scouts mostly . 
B|51| B: [i've] never _actually_ never _actually_ played [it [.] but] 
A|52| A: [oh yeah .] 
B|53| B: [yeah] _because_ when _people_ can't [pay] [they] end [up] _going_ [to] clinics [or] _you know to_ public hospitals [and that] [kind of] thing _and [you_ know] 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] [yeah] [i agree with] [you] _very_ [much] _so ._ [now] [we] waited several years before [we] started _having_ [children] [because] [we] [was] still [in] college [and] [we] knew time wise [or] [and] [money] wise _too_ 
B|55| B: [i'm] [uh my] father _had_ [a] software _company_ 
A|56| A: [yeah] 
B|57| B: [right .] [right .] [we] froze [a lot of] peppers . [we] let [some] turn red . 
A|58| A: [and [uh] [you know] and] _so_ [the] students [were] [you know to] [some] extent motivated [to] learn . 
B|59| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [um] september [really] [was] [i'm not] [sure] [about] october _. i think_ [for] [about] twelve months through september [the] [the] average temperature has [been] higher [than] normal each month . [um] lots [of] ninety degree days during [the] summer . 
B|61| B: [yeah] _how_ old [is] she ? 
A|62| A: [i mean] either [way] [there] [was] family reunion time [or] [not] 
B|63| B: [that is] [not] breed standard . 
A|64| A: [yeah _.] _it's_ the_ same [with] [my] husband cause _he's_ got [pretty] flexible hours [if] _as_ _long_ _as_ _he_ puts [in the] hours _he_ needs _to do ._ worked [out] [really] [well] [for] us _too_ . 
B|65| B: nobody came near [it] when [he] [was] [there] . 
A|66| A: [well] [that's] [good .] 
B|67| B: _then_ _would_ [you] condone [the] burning _of the_ capitol building ? 
A|68| A: [and] [then] [actually] after [there] [i] went [to um] hawaii [a lot of] [my] travel has [been] sort [of] based around conferences [or] business meetings 
B|69| B: [sure .] insurance [should] [pay] [for] [that .] 
A|70| A: [and you] [there] [were] [some] places where [people] 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] [you] [really] aren't isolated [because] [it's the] advantages your home [is] far [enough] away [that] you're [not] bothered [by] [being] [too] close [to] [people] 
A|72| A: _uh-huh . oh_ [that's] great . _long_ _as_ [it's] [not] raining . 
B|73| B: [oh] close [to] five minutes [i] believe . 
A|74| A: [yeah] [i] [was] [kind of] surprised [how] rapidly [they] bypassed [the] three eighty-six . [that] wasn't alive [for but] _maybe_ [two] years . 
B|75| B: [so] [what] [do you] guys [having] [up] [there] ? [i haven't] [been] [up] [there] since [oh] lord forty-eight [i] guess 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [if you] [had] [to do something] [like] [that] day after day . 
B|79| B: [i] [really] _don't think_ [so .] [yeah . i] [really] [don't] [because] [some] [people] _are going_ [to] [are] _are going_ [to] risk [it] [um] [it] _may_ prevent [i i] guess [i] guess [what i'm] trying _to get_ [at] _is if_ [it] [if] [it] [if] [it] [does] help [a few] individuals [maybe] [maybe] [it's] worth [it .] 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [i think] [one] _of the_ problems [with] [with] education [as] [it] relates [to] _this_ though [is that] [i don't [know] that] education [is] prepared [to] help [people] make [those] changes . _it just_ seems [a lot _of] the_ training [and] education [that] goes _on_ [is] gearing [people] towards [a] profession [and] [not] giving [them] [the] skills [and] whatever [those] skills [are] necessary [to] make [those] job changes which [i think is] _going_ [to] _be_ [a] _hard_ thing [for] [for] [people] [to] face . 
A|82| A: [um but] [he] [had] [actually] [was] able [to get] [him] [over] [that .] 
B|83| B: [it is] . [it] [really] [is] . 
A|84| A: [oh yeah] _there's_ 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [the] recycling program [here] [is] [just] terrible [. i mean] [it's hard] [to] find places [to go] [. i mean] kroger [does] [a] couple [things .] [they [i] [don't] [think] they] [do] [they] [do] newspapers ? 
B|87| B: [okay] [he's] [uh] [uh] south [of] renner _on_ _on_ custer . [and] [there [is] [a] little] bitty mall [that] looks [kind of] [like] [or] strip [kind of] center . 
A|88| A: _very_ comfortable [so .] 
B|89| B: [they] [really] [are] . [the] cats [are] [so] independent [and] [they have] [so] [much] [more] personality [than] [a] dog . 
A|90| A: [of] course [not] . 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [well] [you] [you think] [it's] _better_ [than] [to] [to] try [to] spread [the] [the] effort equally among [all the] employees [of the] [company] [or] 
B|93| B: [uh-huh . [oh] .] 
A|94| A: [yeah .] 
B|95| B: drive cars [with] catalytic converters [and] [all] [that [.] it's] interesting . [they're] [they're] looking [at] [there's] [some] _work_ [being] _done_ _on_ [uh] automobiles _that are_ electrical powered 
A|96| A: [really ?] 
B|97| B: [yeah .] [as] far [as] [yeah] getting doctors [and] [all] [that] stuff [yeah .]

B|107| B: [it's] [it's] [very] easy [to do .]

A|122| A: [right] exactly [. _i] i don't_ [the [i] think] almost [the] [only] [way] [that] [drug] testing [can] [be] [done] [fairly] [is if] [it's] across [the] board [from] [from the] janitors [to] [the] executive management .
