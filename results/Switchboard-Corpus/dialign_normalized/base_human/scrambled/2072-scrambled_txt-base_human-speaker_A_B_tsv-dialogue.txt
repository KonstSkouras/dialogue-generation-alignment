[i] would] [like [to] [do] that] [as a] , [as a] family [and , and] [some] [t v] watching . 
A|82| A: [um ,] august , eighty-eight . 
B|83| B: [is that] [right] ? [oh ,] [neat ,] 
A|84| A: [well [,] they do] treat paper [with] chemicals [like] yellow paper [, you know] takes [something] [like] twenty times [as] [long] [to] decompose . 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: [and , uh ,] whether [or] [not] [, um ,] they'll ever [get] into [like] huge transit systems into [big] cities [where] [people] [would] [all] travel on [a] high speed [, uh ,] train [or [,] [or] something] [like] [that] [or ,] 
B|89| B: [yeah [,] that] [would be] even [, [yeah] , [i] didn't] even , [think about that .]
