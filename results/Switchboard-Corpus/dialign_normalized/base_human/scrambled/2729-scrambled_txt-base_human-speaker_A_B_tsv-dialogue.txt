A|100| A: [no [,] a] five speed [. [and] it] , basically [, [it] was] something [that] [a] military guy _had_ ordered [and] hadn't picked [up] [, _and] so_ [it] _had_ been [on the] lot _three_ months _and _they_ were_ [really] eager [to] sell [it .] 
B|101| B: [and] [people] [like] charles manson [, [and ,] [and] some of] [these] [other] [people] , who [were] sentenced [to] death [at the] [time] [they] repealed [the] death penalty , [were] sentenced [to] life [in] prison [, and] [are] [now] , [now] [that] [even] though california [has] reinstated [the] death penalty , [for] whatever various [crimes] . [the] [people] who [were] there originally , [when] _they ,_ [when] [they] changed [the] laws [to] revoke [the] death penalty [, are] _still_ [in] there [for] [, are] [in] prison , [in] quote , [for] life [, [and ,] and] [are] [now] [coming] [up] [for] parole , [some of] [them] [, like] manson who's [come up] [you know]

[when] [you] [start] seeing [what] [all] [they can] [do] [for you] . 
A|114| A: [right .] [what] [about] tomatoes [, aren't they] _pretty_ hardy ? 
B|115| B: [and , uh , and] her nose [is] [that] pink [, you know ,]

B|121| B: [i can] [i can] [just] [do it] 
A|122| A: [uh-huh] [, [and] it] [just] pertained [to] [that] 
B|123| B: [right [.] if] [, if] [the] evidence wasn't overwhelming [, right] ? 
A|124| A: [oh .]
