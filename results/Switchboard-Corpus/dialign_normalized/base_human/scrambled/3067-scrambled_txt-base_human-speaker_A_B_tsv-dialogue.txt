A|16| A: [yeah .] 
B|17| B: _my_ _brother_ _had_ fish _when i was_ [a] kid [i] remember [that] [and] _one of_ his fish jumped _out _of_ the_ _um_ gosh _what do you_ call [it] fish tank _. and_ fried [itself] _on_ _the_ radiator behind _the_ dresser . [i'll] [never] forget [that] _because_ [i] remember _my_ _brother_ _he_ came _home_ _and he_ counted _the_ fish 
A|18| A: [and] [we have] trumpet vine [and] moon flowers [and] [we] planted [those] [out] _by the_ septic [so] _that uh_ [they] [get] plenty [of] water 
B|19| B: [uh] _that's_ came [out] _around_ _the first_ _of the_ _year_ . 
A|20| A: [yeah _.] _but_ it's_ funny _that uh [i_ mean] [like you know] _like i said_ _i think_ last [year] [was] [the first] _time_ [in] [like] eighteen years [for] pennsylvania . i'm [not] even sure [of] _that but_ [for] [some] reason _i think that_ [you know] _it was_ _something_ _like [that_ [.] [and] it] surprised [and] even florida [i] [know] [they have] [it] [and] [you] [don't] [really] hear _about_ [it] [real] often [how] many [people] 
B|21| B: _uh-huh_ 
A|22| A: [we _have] some_ friends [with] [a] [brother] [and] sister golden retriever [and] [those] _dogs_ [have] been _having_ seizures [and] [i] wonder since both [of] [them] are _having_ [them] [if] _it's_ _some kind of_ breeding problem . 
B|23| B: _and uh_ [so] _that's_ [the] program [that] [they're] using _there_ . 
A|24| A: _well_ 
B|25| B: _right_ . 
A|26| A: _really ._ 
B|27| B: [yeah] [they] _down_ here [they] [they] stopped [for] awhile [or] [they] [really] made [it] hard [to] hunt [them] . 
A|28| A: [i] guess [that] _i mean it_ _all_ depends [really] [on] [what] _kind of_ bracket _you're_ [in] . 
B|29| B: [and] _is it_ _um_ [a] natural gas [and] 
A|30| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|31| B: [in] terms [of] motivation [and] incentive [yeah .] 
A|32| A: _but um_ _i have_ [um] _that that_ [was] [the] majority [of] [my] writing although [um] _i have_ also done _oh_ free lance magazine writing [and] [some] educational writing [. and] [um] _for a_ while [i] _had a_ [um] [uh a] partnership [with] [a] [in] [an] advertising agency [with] another woman who [is] [a] [an] artist . [so] [i] [did] [some] advertising [and] p r _but_ 
B|33| B: [uh] [um] [um] _no_ [not] [really .] [in] [that but] _then_ again [uh] _well [i_ you know] [i [have] some] aunts [that uh i] [i] [i] _do _._ that's_ [about] [my] mother's sisters [you know] 
A|34| A: [well] [that's] _okay_ [. i] guess _it's_ [an] easy thing [to] [do .] [so] _you're_ _you [have_ a] big _do you [have_ a] rural house [or] [what _do you] have_ ? 
B|35| B: [well] [in a] sense [that] say [how] [do you] make _a a_ conclusion [that] [you're] going [to] lay off these ten [people] _. uh_ [for] [the] bad times _of the_ company . 
A|36| A: [and so] [one] day [i] got [up] [and] thought [well i] [will] _just_ go casual [and] [you know] [that] [i] called [on] [a] [guy] wearing _exactly_ [that] bib overalls [and he] sort [of] told me _that he_ expected me [to] _be_ professional 
B|37| B: [yeah] [i] [i] new york does [not] 
A|38| A: [yeah] [that's] [i mean] [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] [in] [we have] _had a_ few cases _where [the_ guy] has broken [in] [you know] during [the] middle [of the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|39| B: [so] k [a] l [a] [i think] c h [a] n d . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [oh] [yeah . i] [i] feel [that] everyone [is] everyone [is] [uh] entitled [to] [a] trial [by] jury . [that [that] that] _right_ 
A|42| A: [yeah] [of] course needs [and] wants aren't necessarily [the] same thing . 
B|43| B: [i] [exactly] [where] _she_ [is] [. [but] um] [we] met [in] paris . 
A|44| A: this this friend [of] mine has [well] _it's the_ same [guy that] [was] watching [uh] [my] german shepherd [when] [he] got hit _but uh_ went fishing [with] him [on] friday [and] _took_ _he's_ got [a] full [a] pure bred golden retriever _and then_ [i] [had] [uh] [the] puppy _a little_ tiny puppy [and] [we] went [and] _took_ [the] [two] _dogs_ [up] fishing [. and] this [they] _just_ [they] _had a_ ball romping [around] 
B|45| B: [and] 
A|46| A: [that] [for] [oh] [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _but that_ 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [uh-huh _.] right_ [and then] [the] family _home_ evening too . 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [oh] [yeah] definitely . 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: none [to] cook [. i don't] [like] [to] cook 
A|54| A: are [you] ready [to] start ? 
B|55| B: [do you have] [you] _used_ [um] student loans [and] things [like [that] that] _were_ guaranteed [by the] government ? 
A|56| A: [or] [you know] plead insanity . 
B|57| B: [yeah] [i] [like] [having] cats [around] [or] pets [around] [in] general [i] [i] favor [dogs] over cats _actually_ [but] 
A|58| A: [i] [used] [to] [when i was] putting shop floor computers together [for] guys i'd go [and] [get] their units [and] put [them] together [and] go [and] interface [the] stuff [with] our systems . 
B|59| B: [okay] [yeah _.] well_ [you] [just] [do] 
A|60| A: [and] whoever brought [it] [down] gets [the] lion's share _and the_ rest [of] [it] [is] split [with] [the] rest [with] everybody _in the_ group . 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: anyways [but uh] . [yeah] _we just_ [had a] terrible case [in] virginia [where] [some] _girl_ disappeared _and [and_ [the] guy] [like i said] [he] [just] [uh] [said] [that he] [took] _her_ [but] [he] won't admit [that] _she_ died [or] whatever [and he] won't say [where the] body [is] _because_ [he] knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know] mandatory life sentences [for] murder . 
A|64| A: [well] [that's great] [that] [you] _all_ can work [that] [out] [. that's] [really] _good ._ 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [the] men [that] are [out] [there] fixing power lines are tested [a lot] [and the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with] [with] [the] guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't tested _as_ much . 
B|67| B: [but uh] [then] again [uh] [it's the] hard [to] justify [with] _all the_ wastefulness [of] money [that] [the] government spends [on] [all] _levels of_ _of uh_ government including municipalities [as] [well] [as] state [and] federal governments . 
A|68| A: [i mean] [not] [not] [to] this large scale [as] iraq [but that] 
B|69| B: _right_ . 
A|70| A: [yeah] [well [i] was] [i was] [actually] [in] [uh [a] lot [of] the] b m w are produced [in] [uh] [uh] stutgardt [and uh] [and] munich 
B|71| B: [it] doesn't make sense _. uh_ [but it's] [you know] _one [of_ the] most [uh] productive crop [in the] world [is] corn . 
A|72| A: good-bye . 
B|73| B: [he's] [a little] boy 
A|74| A: [just] [because] there's [a] friend [up] [there] [not] [because] there's much else 
B|75| B: [i think that] starts [in] sixth _grade_ . 
A|76| A: every _time_ [you] [they] [could] buy their way [out] . 
B|77| B: [but] [it was] [good _.] [i mean_ [it] was] [it] _at that_ [time] _there were_ [two] _children_ [and _they] were_ [in] special programs [and] each [one] [was] [a little] over [two] hundred [a] week [and _then] in_ addition [i] paid [a little] bit extra [. but] [the] kids _were_ 
A|78| A: [she] has twelve [children] . 
B|79| B: [oh] [well] [that] sounds [like] fun too 
A|80| A: [yeah [. i] mean] [and and] [in the] once [you] junior high [uh] start junior high starting [in] eighth [grade] [all the] way through high school [there were] four [levels] [. well] [no] [i] guess [it] [in] junior high [it was] still three . [then in] high school [it] changed [into] four [levels [of] uh] [of] instruction [in the] major subjects [. uh] [which] 
B|81| B: [but] [i] [i think] [it] _can't_ [be] [something] [that's] mandatory . 
A|82| A: [so] depending [on] [what] [my] class schedule looks [like] [he] may spend four anywhere from four [to] eight _hours_ [a] day [in] child care [at that] point [. right] now we're trying [to] avoid [it] [but] [we just] [as] [a] matter [of] fact [just] yesterday hired [a a] [girl] [to] [uh] watch him [. [uh] i] [get] [out of] class [at] _certain_ [time] [and] [my] wife [is] already supposed [to] [be] [on] [her] way [to] [her] class . [you know] once [a] day this overlap happens [where] [we] [can't] [one of] us [be] [home] . 
B|83| B: [well] [you know] 
A|84| A: [yeah] [the] population's been [really] [up] . they've [uh] they've [had] longer hunting seasons than [that] even [to get] rid [of] more [of] [them] [because] [they were] [uh] increasing [so] much . 
B|85| B: [two] [hours] [where] ? 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [so] [is it] [uh] are [we] doing lethal injection now ? 
B|87| B: [oh] [exactly] . each individual jury [really] doesn't [have] any perception [of] [what] [um] [the] going [you know if] [you] [will] [the] going [uh] award should [be] [for a] [certain] type [of] case [you know] within [some kind of] range .
