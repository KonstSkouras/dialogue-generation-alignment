A|30| A: [yeah _,] yeah ._ 
B|31| B: [in] terms [of] motivation [and] incentive [, yeah .] 
A|32| A: _but , um _,_ i [have_ [,] um _,] that , that_ [was] [the] majority [of] [my] writing although [, um _,] i have_ also done _oh ,_ free lance magazine writing [and] [some] educational writing [. [and] [,] um _,] _for_ a_ while [i] _had [a_ [,] um [,] uh , a] partnership [with] [a _,] in_ [an] advertising agency [with] another woman who [is] [a ,] [an] artist . [so] [i] [did] [some] advertising [and] p r _but ,_ 
B|33| B: [uh [,] um [,] um _,] no _,_ not_ [really .] [in] [that _, but] ,_ _then_ again [, uh _,] well [, [i_ ,] you know [,] i [have] some] aunts [that , uh [, i] [,] i [,] i] _do _._ that's_ [about] [my] mother's sisters [, you know ,] 
A|34| A: [well] [that's] _okay_ [. i] guess _it's_ [an] easy thing [to] [do .] [so] _you're_ [you] [have a] big , [do you] [have a] rural house [or] [what do you] [have] ? 
B|35| B: [well] [in a] sense [that] say [, how] [do you] make _a , a_ conclusion [that] [you're] going [to] lay off these ten [people] _. uh [,_ for] [the] bad times _of the_ company . 
A|36| A: [and so] _, one_ day [i] got [up] [and] thought [well] [i] [will] _just_ go casual [and] [you know] [that] [i] called [on] [a] [guy] wearing _exactly_ [that ,] bib overalls _, and he_ sort [of] told me _that he_ expected me [to] _be_ professional 
B|37| B: [yeah [,] i [,] i ,] new york does [not] 
A|38| A: [yeah [,] that's [,] [i] mean] [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] _, in_ _, [we_ have] _had a_ few cases _where [the_ guy] has broken [in] [, you know ,] during [the] middle [of the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|39| B: [so] k [a] l [a [,] [i] think] , c h [a] n d . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [oh] [yeah . [i] [,] i] feel [that] everyone [is] , everyone [is] [, uh ,] entitled [to] [a] trial [by] jury . [that [, that] , that] _right_ 
A|42| A: [yeah _,] of_ course , needs [and] wants aren't necessarily [the] same thing . 
B|43| B: [i] [exactly] [where] _she_ [is] [. [but] , um [,] we] met [in] paris . 
A|44| A: this , this friend [of] mine has [, well] _it's the_ same [guy that] [was] watching [, uh ,] [my] german shepherd [when] [he] got hit _, _but , uh_ ,_ went fishing [with] him [on] friday [and] _took_ , _he's_ got [a] full [, a] pure bred golden retriever _and then_ [i] [had] [, uh _,] the_ puppy [, _a] little_ tiny puppy [and] [we] went [and] _took_ [the] [two] _dogs_ [up] fishing [. and] this [, they] _just [,_ they] _had a_ ball romping [around] , 
B|45| B: [and] 
A|46| A: [that [,] for] , _oh ,_ [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _but that ,_ 
A|48| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [uh-huh _.] right_ [, [and] then] [the] family _home_ evening , too . 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [oh [,] [yeah] ,] definitely . 
A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: none [to] cook [. i don't] [like] [to] cook 
A|54| A: are [you] ready [to] start ? 
B|55| B: [do _you] ,_ [have] [you] _used_ [, um ,] student loans [and] things [like that] [that] _were_ guaranteed [by the] government ? 
A|56| A: [or] [, you know ,] plead insanity . 
B|57| B: [yeah [,] i] [like] [having] cats [around] [or] pets [around] [in] general [i [,] i] favor [dogs] over cats _actually_ [but ,] 
A|58| A: [i] [used] [to] , [when i was] putting shop floor computers together [for] guys , i'd go [and] [get] their units [and] put [them] together [and] go [and] interface [the] stuff [with] our systems . 
B|59| B: [okay] [, yeah _.] well_ [you] [just] [do] , 
A|60| A: [and] whoever brought [it] [down] gets [the] lion's share _and the_ rest [of] [it] [is] split [with] [the] rest , [with] everybody _in the_ group . 
B|61| B: [yeah .] 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: anyways [, but , uh] . [yeah [,] _we] just_ [had a] terrible case [in] virginia [where] [some] _girl_ disappeared [and [,] [and] [the] guy] [, like i said] _, he_ [just [,] uh ,] [said] [that he] [took] _her_ [, but] [he] won't admit [that] _she_ died [or] whatever [, and he] won't say [where the] body [is] _because_ [he] knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know ,] mandatory life sentences [for] murder . 
A|64| A: [well [,] [that's] great] [that] [you] _all_ can work [that] [out] [. that's] [really] _good ._ 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [the] men [that] are [out] [there] fixing power lines are tested [a lot] [and the] men [that] drive [the] trucks [with] , [with] [the] guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't tested _as_ much . 
B|67| B: [but , uh ,] [then] again [, uh ,] [it's _the] ,_ hard [to] justify [with] _all the_ wastefulness [of] money [that] [the] government spends [on] [all] _levels of [,_ _of] , uh ,_ government , including municipalities [as] [well] [as] state [and] federal governments . 
A|68| A: [i mean] [, not] [, not] [to] this large scale [as] iraq [, [but] that ,] 
B|69| B: _right_ . 
A|70| A: [yeah [,] well , [i] _was] [,_ [i] was] [actually] [in] [, uh , [a] lot [of] the] b m w are produced [in] [, uh [,] uh ,] stutgardt [and , uh [,] and] munich 
B|71| B: [it] doesn't make sense _. uh [,_ [but] it's] [, you know _,] one [of_ the] most [, uh ,] productive crop [in the] world [is] corn . 
A|72| A: good-bye . 
B|73| B: [he's] [a little] boy 
A|74| A: [just] [because] there's [a] friend [up] [there [,] not] [because] there's much else 
B|75| B: [i think that] starts [in] sixth _grade_ . 
A|76| A: every _time_ [you [,] they] [could] buy their way [out] . 
B|77| B: [but] [it was] [good _.] [i mean_ [it] [was] [,] [it] ,] _at that_ [time] _there were_ [two] _children_ [and _they] were_ [in] special programs [and] each [one] [was] [a little] over [two] hundred [a] week [and then] [, in] addition [, i] paid [a little] bit extra [. but] [the] kids _were ,_ 
A|78| A: [she] has twelve [children] . 
B|79| B: [oh] [well] [that] sounds [like] fun too 
A|80| A: [yeah [. i] mean] [, and] [and] [in [the] ,] once [you] junior high [, uh ,] start junior high , starting [in] eighth [grade] [all the] way through high school , [there were] four [levels] [. [well] [,] no [,] i] guess [it] [in] junior high [, [it] was] still three . [then] [in] high school [it] changed [into] four [levels [of ,] uh [,] of] instruction [in the] major subjects [. uh ,] [which] , 
B|81| B: [but] [i [,] [i] think] [it] _can't_ [be] [something] [that's] mandatory . 
A|82| A: [so] depending [on] [what] [my] class schedule looks [like [,] he] may spend four , anywhere from four [to] eight _hours_ [a] day [in] child care [at that] point [. right] now we're trying [to] avoid [it [,] but] [we [just] ,] [as] [a] matter [of] fact [just] yesterday hired [a , a] [girl] [to] [, uh ,] watch him [. [uh ,] i] [get] [out of] class [at] _certain_ [time] [and] [my] wife [is] already supposed [to] [be] [on] [her] way [to] [her] class . [you know ,] once [a] day this overlap happens [where] [we] [can't] [, one of] us [be] [home] . 
B|83| B: [well [,] you know] 
A|84| A: [yeah _,] the_ population's been [really] [up] . they've [, uh ,] they've [had] longer hunting seasons than [that] even [to get] rid [of] more [of] [them] , [because] [they [were] [,] uh ,] increasing [so] much . 
B|85| B: [two] [hours] [where] ? 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [so] [is it [,] uh ,] are [we] doing lethal injection now ? 
B|87| B: [oh ,] [exactly] . each individual jury [really] doesn't [have] any perception [of] [what] [, um [,] the] going [, you know , if] [you] [will] [the] going [, uh ,] award should [be] [for a] [certain] type [of] case [, you know ,] within [some kind of] range .
