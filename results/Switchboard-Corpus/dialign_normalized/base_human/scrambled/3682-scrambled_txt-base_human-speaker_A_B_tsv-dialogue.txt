B|23| B: _and , and_ [that] should [be] _first_ _and , and_ children second . _but_ [they] _don't_ [have] [kind of] _an_ _, what_ _we_ _call_ _an_ internal perspective _of things ._ 
A|24| A: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh _._ uh-huh _._ uh-huh ._ 
B|25| B: tablets ?

B|27| B: [uh ,] _he's_ [, uh ,] [up in] , huh ? 
A|28| A: okay _. uh ,_ far _as_ _, you know ,_ crime _in the_ cities [, i'm] _sure_ , [like] [in] yours [it's] _pretty_ , _pretty_ _bad_ _. uh ,_ [probably] [the] biggest _thing_ we've _got_ _going_ _now_ _is the_ robberies [and] theft [and] [probably] murder [are] _the two_ top _ones_ _that we_ [have] . 
B|29| B: [well _,] that [,_ and] [the [,] and] [the] economy [is] [so] [bad] _and , _and_ so_ many people [have] [been] laid off [and] stuff . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [you know ,] [of] course there's still _a lot of_ _work_ [to be] _done [,_ _and] then when_ [you] [get] [it] completely [, you know [,] the] shell finished _, uh , you_ still [have _a] lot of_ stuff _to do_ inside _, but_ [, uh ,] 
A|32| A: [it] will [be] forty hour week , _not_ _, no_ , eight [to] five type [of] _thing_ . 
B|33| B: [and] _they're_ preoccupied _with_ , drinking . 
A|34| A: [yeah [.] and] [it's] _more_ _than_ even paper _or_ [something like that .] _there is_ _more_ energy _in it_ per pound _or whatever _._ well_ _that was_ he _didn't_ deal _with that ._ 
B|35| B: gosh . [that's] [great .] [that's] _a lot ._ 
A|36| A: [oh ,] 
B|37| B: _and , uh ,_ [we] _really_ missed them _when_ [they] _were_ gone _, because_ [the] [ones] [from the] grocery store _just_ _can't_ , compare . 
A|38| A: [well ,] _my_ favorite type [of] music [is] classical music _, _and , uh ,_ _i_ , i_ _enjoy_ orchestral classical music _and i_ _enjoy_ classical guitar [and] classical piano [, you know [,] and] [that's] , _those_ _are [,_ that's] _my_ favorite type . 
B|39| B: here [in] new york [it's] _a lot_ harder [than] _that [,_ uh] 
A|40| A: [that's] [like] _me_ . 
B|41| B: [i] . 
A|42| A: [yeah ,] flavor _. uh-huh [._ yeah .] 
B|43| B: [um ,] _a lot _of_ [,_ uh ,] [one] _place_ [that we] went _just_ recently [uh ,] [was] [to] atchafalaya . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] [they] live lean _for_ [one] _thing_ [and] [they] tithe [and] _they it_ puts [a] whole _in your_ money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor god [with] _this_ portion [and [so] they _,] _i think_ that_ helps [a lot [.] [i] think] [that's] [the] key [, in] he , [like] _his_ sales last _year_ he [just] works [a] normal _job_ . he [probably] _has_ [an] income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] last _year_ he made [that] _got_ him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash _for_ [a] full size van . he loves god [, _i] mean_ , [it] [was] [the] biggest _thing that_ [any] [one] [in] _this_ company [had] ever [done ,] 
B|45| B: "i said , ""hey , wouldn't _you like_ [to] [know] _what's_ happening [with] these people ? "" ""yeah [, but] [i'm] [, you know [,] it's] too _much_ trouble . "" _so i_ [got] busy , [got] together [, and] [put] [a] reunion together [for] [his] [family] [. and] succeeded [in] [getting] _all_ [of] [his] brothers [and] sisters [and] _all_ [of] their offspring [but] [one] [to] our _place_ down _at_ lake tawakoni . " 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [i] teach [, uh ,] [like] [what] [is] traditionally taught [, you know [,] _you] look at_ [the] note _on the_ page [and] [you] _play_ [what's] _on the_ piano [, but] he [can't] learn [like that .] [he's] [a] delayed child . [he's] only _about_ [, _i] guess_ [he's] _about_ _two_ [and] [a] half [in] [his] [real] understanding [of things .] 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [and , uh _, i] was_ raised _, uh , you know ,_ hunting _all the_ _time_ [, i] _lived_ [on the] farm [, and _, uh ,] you know ,_ [enjoy] hunting [and [i] guess] [i] _have [,_ uh ,] [some] problems [with] [, uh ,] _being_ restricted [to] [, um ,] owning [a] gun [for] [, you know ,] hunting purposes mainly . 
A|52| A: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh _._ uh-huh [._ yeah .] 
B|53| B: [yeah _.] i , i_ used [to] [play] soccer _when _i_ was_ _that age_ [up in] new york , 
A|54| A: [and [i] [,] uh _, i] think_ [what] _we're_ [, what] _we're_ _trying [to_ do] [is] create sort [of] [a] wind break [because] [i] tell [you] [, _in] the_ winter [time] [when] [that ,] [when] [that] wind comes _out_ _of the_ north , [it just] cuts [right] through [you like] _you're_ _not_ even [there] . 
B|55| B: [so] [, that's] [not] [a] good _way_ [to] 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] [right] [, right . yeah [,] [i] , [i] , i] imagine _you're_ [right [.] i , i] teach swim lessons [a lot] [, [and _,] and] to_ [see] [what] , [see] [what] [kids] _talk about_ [when] [, uh , you know _,] they're_ _, they're_ open _about_ , [well [,] you know ,] [kids] [are a lot] _more_ educated _now_ [than] _i think [that_ [,] that ,] [like] [we] [were] [, uh ,] [at] [that age] [um ,] _about_ [a lot [of] things .] 
B|57| B: [i] am [a] speech pathology major [and _so] i_ [do] [a lot of] clinical _work_ [and] _when i_ [do] clinic _work_ _then_ [i] [have] [to] [, uh [,] uh ,] [look] [my] [best] . 
A|58| A: [uh-huh .] [right _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|59| B: [um .] 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [right [.] well [,] [i] put] , 
A|62| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] [was] [it] very expensive ? 
A|64| A: [yeah] _this is_ [, it's] [like] [a] duplex , [like] [a] _two_ by _two_ [they] [call] [it] [like] [in] pittsburgh . 
B|65| B: [i think] maybe [you look at] [, uh [,] the] [age] [of the] [person] [and] their station [in] _life_ [and [, and] , uh ,] [how] _much_ longer [they] [have] [of] _work_ years [that] [they] _would have_ [to] [put] [up] [, you know ,] [with] , [with that [.] [i] mean] maybe [you] [don't] award [an] eighty-five [year] old guy [the] same [thing that] [you] _would_ award [a] twenty-one [year] old . 
A|66| A: [right .] 
B|67| B: [well [,] i] [sure] need them [. uh ,] there's [no] _way_ _that i_ could begin [to] process [and] keep [up] [with] [the] kinds [of] information [or] [the] magnitude [of] information _that i_ need [to] [, to] try _to do my_ [job] without them . 
A|68| A: [i] [had a] lawn service [to do my] yard [for] _me_ [during the] [real] hot summer months [, you know ,] until [i] retired 
B|69| B: [yeah [.] uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [yeah .] [um ,] _do [you_ like] _big_ dogs [or] [or] _little_ dogs ? 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [and , uh _,] [so_ _i] don't_ [, _i] just don't_ [like] anything [that i] [can't] figure _out_ _why_ [it] doesn't [work] 
B|73| B: [um ,] [now] _i didn't_ [know] [that ,] cause [we] [just] usually _if_ [we're] [going to] [, uh ,] [buy] sodas [they're] [in [the] , [the] two] liter bottles . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh] _, [so_ .] 
B|75| B: [oh [,] no] . 
A|76| A: [sure] . 
B|77| B: [i just don't] understand [why] [they [,] so] _much_ _want to_ [just] _stay_ [in] [that] building . 
A|78| A: [oh .] 
B|79| B: [yeah [.] well [,] i think] [one] [of [the] , [the] best] ways [to] eliminate [, uh [,] or] help [the] recycling problem [is] [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
A|80| A: [uh _,] there is_ [a lot] [, you] ever go by lucky computer [there] ? 
B|81| B: [and [i] think _that] it would_ help people [to] become , less self-centered [, and [to] be] [more] responsible [when] [you're] [out] [on] [your] _own_ [trying to] [, um ,] thinking less [of] [your] _own_ needs [but] , [of] _other_ people . 
A|82| A: [and] [that's] [it] [was] [really] different [being] [in] [a] _big_ city [, because] _i don't_ [get] [much] [into] urban [, you know ,] [really] urban areas [a lot] 
B|83| B: [do] [do you] [put] [it] [in the] refrigerator _then_ [or] 
A|84| A: [like] [i] say [it's] [just] , 
B|85| B: [uh ,] [they [,] they're] [up] [there] [in] [that] mall [. uh ,] [just] below campbell . [or] [that] strip , strip , center . 
A|86| A: [yeah ,] [when i] [had a] cocker spaniel _it ,_ [it] [was] [an] outdoor dog [and , uh [, i] think] [i] liked [that] better . 
B|87| B: [and [i] think] [they] [really] [it] [really] penetrates [in your] memory [, you know [,] what] [to do] [, because] [you] [really] [have a] [great] interest [in _it] ._ [because] [it's] [something] [you] weren't forced [to do] 
A|88| A: [i ,] _this is the_ [first] home we've [lived] [in] we've [had a] sprinkler system , 
B|89| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|90| A: [so] [we're] considering pennsylvania [, and] [we're] [just] [kind [of] [,] you know ,] toying [with] [what] exactly , [where] [we] [want [to] be] [, you know] . 
B|91| B: absolutely . 
A|92| A: [and then [when] [i] put] [the] verandas which will [be] twelve feet [out] [all the] [way] around [on the] north , south [and] east sides [that] will define [the] shop . 
B|93| B: [and ,] 
A|94| A: [oh .] 
B|95| B: [well [,] there is] [so] [much] [about it] [to] [like] . 
A|96| A: bye-bye . 
B|97| B: [yes [,] it's] nothing [to be] proud [of ,] certainly [not] . 
A|98| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|99| B: ours [is] [not] [a] _working_ farm 
A|100| A: [it] depends [on] [, [you] can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|101| B: [yeah .] 
A|102| A: nancy [, that's] [right] , 
B|103| B: very frustrating [. uh [,] but] again i've [been] dealing [with] large files both data [and , and] otherwise [. uh [,] [that] was] [a] engineering spec [on] b [two] . [you] come here [with] [the] b level [of] specs ? 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: [yeah .] 
A|106| A: [yeah [,] i] [know [,] and] [that's] [, you know ,] [like] [i] [can] [look] outside [right] [now] [and] [look] [into] [the] next unit . 
B|107| B: [and , uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are ,] [are] guys [that] [are [,] you know] [going to] [get] caught anyways [but] , there's [always] [a] few [of] [those] people [that] [are [,] you know ,] lost their head [or whatever .] 
A|108| A: [if] [i didn't] [have a] [family] [, _i] don't_ [think] [i] [would [have] ,] _as_ , _as_ [a] male [or] _as_ [a] , _as_ [an] individual [of [,] in] _this_ stage [of] [my] [life] [, _i] don't_ [think] [i] [would have] insurance [, uh ,] [other] , 
B|109| B: [well ,] [they [it] [,] [the] ,] their , [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely good , such [things] [as] extremely good school systems _, for_ example . [it] [has] [one] [of [the] best] school systems [in the] country . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [yeah .] flexible hours [are ,] [are] [pretty] important [to] [me] [as] [well] . 
A|112| A: [and i] _did_ [it [,] um [,] for] [one] reason [i] wanted [, i was] [working] [on] [a] masters degree [so i] wanted [to] [stay] close [to] [where] [i was] [working] [on] [a] masters degree [, but] also [because] [i just] thought [that it would] [be] interesting [to] live [some] [place] else [so] totally different [than] [my] [own] [up] bringing 
B|113| B: [oh [,] i] [see] . how'd , [how] [did] [they ,] [how] [do they] pick their people ? 
B|114| B: [so] [this is the] [big] issue [with] us . although [i don't] recall marking [it] [on] [my] [little] [things] [to] [talk about] [but] perhaps [they] [are] [little] [for] words [to be] said [like] day care [and] quality [time] [and ,]
