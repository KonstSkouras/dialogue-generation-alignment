B|29| B: hey , 
A|30| A: _yes ._ _and it's_ amazing [how] much _good_ _things_ _like_ [, uh ,] sesame _street_ _will_ _do_ . 
B|31| B: [yes .] 
A|32| A: _no_ actually _i haven't_ [been] _all_ through _europe_ , _like_ _i haven't_ [been] [to] italy yet . 
B|33| B: [oh] [yes ,] [yes .] 
A|34| A: [uh-huh .] _well ,_ _do_ , _do_ [you] [think] _that's_ _good_ [or] bad ? 
B|35| B: [i] _listen _to_ the_ radio [, uh _,] probably_ [five] [or] six _hours _a_ week_ [, but] almost inevitably _to a_ station [that] [is] [a] classical [, uh ,] station here [, for] music purposes . 
A|36| A: wow [, yeah .] 
B|37| B: [that's] _always_ [a] [good] [thing] . vegetable trays _always_ [go] over [so] [well [,] because] [i think] [people] _get_ tired [of] eating junk _. _i mean_ [, i_ think] [they] [like] [to have] healthy stuff too [, you know] [it's] , 
A|38| A: _and we_ _went_ [to a] pen [of] _a little bit_ bigger dogs [and] _all_ [the] others _were_ standing _there_ barking [and] jumping _up_ [and] _down_ . [and] _one_ _dog_ [would] stand _there_ wagging _her_ tail [and] smiling [and] _that ,_ [was] mine . 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [have] [you] , [have] [you] _done_ this repetitively , [or] _just_ once ? 
B|41| B: _kind _of_ [,_ uh ,] [little] guy [in] [there] . he , he [, uh ,] gives reasonable prices . 
A|42| A: [and] _i'm_ _just_ wondering [if] _you're_ fighting [a] natural process [there] [of] being winnowed _out_ . there's [a] german word [for] [it] [that's] elegant [, _but] i_ never [can] remember _what_ _it was , uh _,_ but [,_ but] [that] _they're_ , _they're_ being winnowed [because] _they're_ , where [they] _are_ _they're_ [not] adapted [to] [their] environment essentially . 
B|43| B: [to] [her] [go] talk [to] daddy _about [it_ .] excuse [me] . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [yeah .] 
A|46| A: _do_ [you] [have] children ? 
B|47| B: [because] _i mean , i_ play [the] flute [and] [not] [many] [things] [you can] play that'll [, you know ,] [people] [will] sit [there] [and] sing along [to] [and] [you] can't sing along either [so [,] _but [,] uh ,_ i] [like [a] lot] [, uh , i] [like] classical music [just] [because] [of [the] ,] [when] [, i] [, [i] don't] play [, i] [like] jazz music [but] 
A|48| A: [really] [. uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: _i'm not_ _sure_ _what you're_ talking [about] . 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [but i] lived [in] [in] _florida_ [for] [ten years [and] i] _kind of like_ [it] _down there_ [, but] _they had_ [a] gun control law which [went] [a little bit] too _far_ . 
A|52| A: [and] then even [my] eleven year old boy loves [to] [listen to] [it .] 
B|53| B: [they're] encouraged [to do [that] ,] missionary work [, and i] [i] [really] believe [that the] [people] [that] [do [that] are] [better] [people] [that] [make] our , society [better] . 
A|54| A: [because] otherwise [what you're] doing [is] [you're] letting [people] [in] [and] [you're] , [you're] dooming [them] [to] being underclass [people] . 
B|55| B: [yes ,] [uh-huh .] _that's [,_ that's] fairly recent [, [i] don't [know] _,] how_ recent [, but] fairly recent , [in the] state [of] [texas] . before [that [,] [it was] , uh ,] death by electrocution . 
A|56| A: okay , looks [like] we're ready [to] [go] . capital punishment [, uh ,] [the] problem [i] [have] [with] capital punishment [is] [that [,] uh [,] uh ,] [it's] supposed [to] [be] [a] deterrent [to] crime [, [but] [i] don't] [think] [that] [it] [really] actually does _that [._ [i] don't] [think] [it] deters anybody [, because] most [of the] time crimes [are] [, uh ,] [are] committed [with a] , without any thought [to the] consequences _and _they_ don't_ [think] [that [,] uh ,] stop [and] [think] [and] say , [well ,] maybe [i] shouldn't [do] this [, uh [,] because] [, uh , i] might [get] [the] gas chamber [or] _something like that ._ [they] worry [about it] afterwards [and] then [they] try [and] _get out of_ [it .] [and , uh [,] how] [about] [you] 
B|57| B: [they don't] [get out [of] _the] house_ [, [they] don't] socialize [but] [it's] [my] home [and [i] don't] _want to_ leave [it .] 
A|58| A: [oh ,] boy [, i] bet _all_ [the] men [that] [got] direct [down there] _were_ [just] [right] [on] [it] 
B|59| B: [and it's] [the] alsatian [that's] [the] kid's [dog] . [it's just [,] [you] see] [them] [in] [europe] [and] [they're] [just] lovely . 
A|60| A: [they're] _all_ [my] parents age . [and , uh ,] [so] he's [got [,] you know ,] his retirement though [is] [really] twenty-four [hours a] day . [they] [have] [a] day _care_ two days [a week] . [they] call [it] senior citizen day _care_ . [but] she goes [in the] senior citizen center . 
B|61| B: [yeah , i] [do] too . 
A|62| A: [right] 
B|63| B: _i mean ,_ [we] educate [them] , [we] feed [them] , [we] take [care] _of them_ [and they] [no] sooner [get out] [on the] [street] [and] [they're] [back in] again . 
A|64| A: [yeah [,] you] [probably] [get] this [, probably] pretty sticky after [you] [get] _done_ . 
B|65| B: _um_ . 
A|66| A: [i] [know] [florida] has [it .] 
B|67| B: [it's] [a] farm community [, [and] we] . 
A|68| A: [yeah .] 
B|69| B: [i haven't] [done] [it] [in] _quite_ awhile since [i] moved [down] here . 
A|70| A: [yeah , i] thought [they had] _some_ sort [of [,] [i] mean , i] thought _they were_ [just] poor [people] [like] us [i] [guess] [not] [, that's] great . 
B|71| B: [you know ,] [back] _around_ [, you know ,] [in the] twenties [and] thirties [when] [they were] growing [up] [, uh [, you] know [,] [they] were] [all] located together , [in] [one] small community . 
A|72| A: [uh [,] but [,] you [know] .] [we] [really need] [the] rain [that] we've [been] getting _, and it_ has [not] today [, but] [the] last few days [it's] [been] , [been] pouring most [of the] day . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh . yeah] [it's] top speed [is] [something like] eighty miles _an hour_ [. so] [it's] [a] [good] , [good] vehicle . 
A|74| A: [and [i] think] [it's] [really] very sad [that] north [of the] border [, you know ,] [the] united states [and] canada [is] [so] different , [from] [the] [from] south america [, and] central america . 
B|75| B: [something like that .] 
A|76| A: [and] [little] boys [are] [around] [the house] [a] whole [lot] more than girls . 
B|77| B: [yeah .] 
A|78| A: [well ,] [i'm not] even [sure] [all] [of them] [are] anymore . at least [in] this area . 
B|79| B: [some of] [that] opportunity [for] job change [in the] fact [that ,] [that] aspects changing . 
A|80| A: [uh [,] they] [, uh [,] they] [have] [a] subbranch [, uh ,] american [family] counseling [and] [their] [people] staff this , this [, uh ,] [the] [child] [care] center [just] off campus . [but , uh [,] they] [have] [a] pretty [good] size waiting list . 
B|81| B: [i] [, [i] don't know] [what] foley's [is] 
A|82| A: [but [i] think] [it] also cost , [um] , [quite] [a] [bit] [as] [far] [as] [because] after [they're] [done] [with] [the] war , [a lot] [of] [things] [were] [no] longer put [to] use [. i mean] [it was] [kind of like] , okay , we'll [do] this during this point [and] time [but] after [that] [that's [,] you know [,] uh] [they] didn't [want [to] do] [it] anymore . 
B|83| B: [yeah [,] [and it] was] [not] [only] [in] mississippi , [in] [some] other places , [as] [well ,] 
A|84| A: [they're] [always] , [always] happy [. [i] don't] [think] [i've] ever [seen] [them] [not] look happy . 
B|85| B: [yes .] 
A|86| A: [so] [that's] [a] half [an hour] roughly [the] same [with] newspaper .
