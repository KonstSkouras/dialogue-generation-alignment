B|27| B: [so] [i] called _four_ [or] _five_ dog trainers _because _i_ don't_ [like] [the] [little] dogs . 
A|28| A: [because] i'm always worrying [it] won't firm _up_ [because] _it , _when_ you_ _take_ [it] _out of_ [the] saucepan [it's like] , boy _, i_ hope _this_ thickens _a little_ [more] [because] [it's] _not_ [like] real package thick [, you know _,] _when_ you_ cook [a] package _, _it's ,_ it's_ _a little_ less , 
B|29| B: [yeah ,] fluid resistance .

A|34| A: tight turns , _hard_ acceleration . _i've_ seen _a lot of_ mustangs [, uh ,] compete [and] [it's] _interesting ._ [they] [get] dominated by [the] corvettes [that are] [also] [in] their class . 
B|35| B: [it _,] [it_ [,] _it's] pretty_ [bad] _here [,_ too] .

A|42| A: [uh-huh .] [it] [sure] _is ._ _the [,_ you know ,] _as_ _far_ _as_ _, i think_ there was [something] _with_ [the] government official [that] [went] [on] conferences [for] _two_ days [and] actually [, uh _,] the_ conferences _were_ nothing [but , uh [,] you know ,] [they're] getting paid [for] _this_ [, and] [it] was [something] [more] [than] [just] [the] conferences .

B|43| B: quicker maybe _, _yeah_ ._ 
A|44| A: _yes ._ 
B|45| B: [uh ,] what _do [you_ think] ? 
A|46| A: [in] fact _, i think_ [they're] getting [a] _different_ guy [for] [a] backup quarterback _. i_ haven't [, uh _,] i_ haven't kept _up_ _with_ [it] lately _, but_ [i] remember reading [something] [a] few months ago [about] [them] signing somebody else [on] _, _or ,_ or_ [trying to] _go_ [after] somebody [or] trade [for] somebody _, but_ [it] wasn't anybody _i'd_ [really] [heard] _of [._ but] [i] [heard] [on the] radio _this_ morning _, or_ yesterday morning _, that [,_ uh ,] aikman's back [in] practicing , doing real , real [well] . [um ,] who [is] [it ,] michael irvin 
B|47| B: [so] [i] [do] _love_ classical music [or] [it] [or [, or] [,] uh ,] contemporary classical . 
A|48| A: [oh ,] god . 
B|49| B: [and] _why_ can't _you ,_ _why_ can't [the] f d [a] [say [,] you know _,] if_ [these] [people] knowingly consent [to] [be] , research monkeys [and] [well ,] _let_ [them ,] 
A|50| A: [and] [then] before [the] milk gets [too] hot [, um _,] i_ add _two_ beaten eggs [and i] [really] mix [them in] good . [and] [then] _about a_ half [a] cup [of] sugar [and i] [let] [it] [pretty] _much_ _, i_ beat [it] [like] every minute [for] _about ten_ seconds [and] _it's , it_ starts thickening _, when it_ thickens [the] cornstarch might [get a [little] _,] [i don't_ [know] [,] it] gets [like] [little] globs [of] _this_ rubbery cornstarch [, and] _you just_ [keep] beating [it] [in] . [and] [it's] _the , the_ trick [is] , [is] [to] [have] _this_ blender [, _so] [,_ if] [you] _were_ , you'd [have] [to] probably almost _go_ _out and_ _someone_ who's [just] [going [to] make] [it] _first_ time _, it's ,_ you'll [have] _much_ better luck [if] _you had_ _one of these_ [little] blenders . [and] [then] [you] can add cocoa powder [to] [it] [to make] chocolate [or] [after] [it's] thickened [i] cook [it] [for] [a] good , once [it] starts boiling _, i_ _just _,_ i_ cook [it] [for] [a] good seven minutes , seven [to] _ten_ minutes 
B|51| B: [well , i] thought [i'd] [, you know ,] [i'd] use [it as] [a ,] an escapement [type] [thing [.] [i] don't know] [if] you're familiar _with that_ operation [, [but] ,] what _you do_ [is] [you just] build [up] [the] pressure 
A|52| A: wow . 
B|53| B: what [are] [they] [going] [up] _to ,_ thirty bucks [or] [something] ? 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] _right [._ uh-huh .] _right_ _, because_ [they're] [a] danger [to] everybody else . huh [, that's] _interesting [._ i] [have] [to [,] uh] agree [with _that] ._ 
B|55| B: [so] _at_ [one] [point] [i] [had a] snake , skunk , dog [and] cat running loose [in the] house . 
A|56| A: [but] [the] [four] bedrooms _and all_ [the] rest [of] [it] sounds [just] [about] [about] alike [. _i] think_ [it's pretty] _much_ _typical_ [for] _this_ area . 
B|57| B: _but [it's ,_ it's] [so] lonely [, you know] [they] can't [get] [out and] [see] anyone [and [i] mean [,] it's] [hard] [for] _, for_ [someone] [like] _me_ [to] understand [that] 
A|58| A: [oh _,] no _,_ no _,_ no _,_ _no_ ._ 
B|59| B: _yeah ._ 
A|60| A: [yeah ,] [in] certain crimes .

B|63| B: _is that_ [so] _? i_ [didn't] _know [that_ .] 
A|64| A: [the] _i think_ _the [,_ i] guess [the] only real [, um ,] benefit [i] guess [you] _could_ [say] working [, for] [me] working [here ,] besides [i mean] i'm learning [and stuff] _because ,_ i'm [at] [, you know ,] [in] [school] . 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [yeah .] 
B|67| B: [yes .] [yes .] 
A|68| A: [i] [have] xanadu [and] precious [, and] rascal . 
B|69| B: [oh [,] [it's ,] _it] [is_ [.] i mean [,] [the] , the] number [of] single _family_ units [on] sale [is] phenomenal compared [to] [the] population . 
A|70| A: _so , uh [,_ that] [story] [i] [just] told [you] [about] [my] mother's beautiful cousin _, well [,_ _the] same thing_ happened [here] [in] arlington _, when_ was [it _,] i think_ [it] was , [oh [,] it] was almost [a] [year] ago [in] december _to a_ girl [that] [my] daughter [had] graduated [from] high [school] [with] . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] _okay _._ well_ ... 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [oh [,] i don't] [like] nineties . 
A|74| A: _right ._ 
B|75| B: [yeah [,] well [,] that] makes [a] [really] [big] difference [. but [,] [but] ,] still [it's] [just] [as] [hard] [as] having [, that ,] 
A|76| A: [but] [it is] nice [to] [have] [it] [because] _there's_ [, uh ,] [with] our size [of] [family] [it's] nice [to] [know that] _there's one_ [that's] always straight [and] clean [if] _you have_ [someone] _come_ [just] [on the] spur [of] [the moment] . 
B|77| B: [now] _why_ [would] [you] [go [to] a] seafood restaurant [to] eat chicken ? 
A|78| A: [i don't] [think] [that's] [a] pleasure [for] anybody [, the] [the] mowing . 
B|79| B: [not] [too] [much] . what [kind of ,] what [kind of] [things] _do you_ write ? 
A|80| A: forgot [about] [that .] 
B|81| B: _okay ._ 
A|82| A: huh-uh [. [well] ,] i'm [in] pennsylvania . 
B|83| B: [yeah [,] the] [first] , [first] couple [of times] [it's pretty] scary [but , uh ,] [after] _that you_ realize [they are] [just] [as] [afraid of _you] [,_ too] . 
A|84| A: [have] [you [,] [have] , have] [you] seen _this_ often ? 
B|85| B: [right .] 
A|86| A: [and [,] they] _were_ very helpful 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: instead [of] being carried 
B|89| B: [uh [,] _do] you know_ where [, uh ,] custer [is] ? 
A|90| A: [yeah .] 
B|91| B: [yeah [.] [i] [,] uh ,] those onions [, i think] [, we] [, we] planted [like] twice [as] [much] [this] [year] [because [,] you know [,] we] [got] , onions [and] [they] lasted [from] [, you know ,] [about] [when you] harvest [them] [about a] month [from] [now] [or] [so [,] or] six weeks , [from] [now ,] until , until [like] october , 
A|92| A: [well [,] it] can [get] expensive 
B|93| B: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [well ,] good [to] hear [. i] was [just] talking [to] [someone] [the other] day [from] pennsylvania . 
B|95| B: [lot [of] them] [are] former music teachers [or] currently teaching . [uh ,] others [have ,] [there's one] gal [that's] [in [the] [,] uh ,] plano community orchestra . [uh , [just] [,] you know ,] [different] backgrounds . [it's] [been] [really] [kind of] [interesting .] 
A|96| A: [okay .] i'm [sure] [that i] probably [, uh ,] prescribe [to] [different] magazines ones [that [you] do] 
B|97| B: [yeah [,] [it] [, when] it] comes [on the] manufacturing floor [it's] [about ten] bucks . 
A|98| A: real excited [when] [i] [heard] [this] . [so] _far_ [i've] [been] [trying to] _call_ _all_ day [because i] [keep] getting [these] subjects [like] capital punishment [so] football [, i] [love] [this] . 
B|99| B: [so , uh ,] 
A|100| A: nursing homes . 
B|101| B: _yeah , yeah_ 
A|102| A: [and] [it's] probably [because [i] [,] [i] [,] i] was born [in the] chicago area [and] grew [up] [in] california [, and] [at] [that] [point] [that] was sort [of] [the] limit [but] [since then] [i've] [been] abroad [a lot] , 
B|103| B: [yeah .] 
A|104| A: [oh] [yeah , [yeah] [,] we] _do [,_ we] _call_ [that] doing biscuits ,

A|106| A: [right .] 
B|107| B: [okay .] 
A|108| A: [oh ,] [don't] [you] hate [that] ? [i've] [got] [a [,] i] [got] [a] few pounds [to] lose myself . [that's] [okay .] 
B|109| B: [yeah [,] that's] [not] [too] [far] [from] [were] [we] live [, _do] [you_ [have] [,] _you] said_ [you had] [two] cats , [are] [they] [, um [,] just] what [you] [call] [it ,] [are] [they] breed cats [or] anything [or] [are] [they] [just ,] 
A|110| A: _no [,_ that's] [okay] 
B|111| B: [okay] 
A|112| A: wow . [why] [is that] ? [do you know] [? [i] mean] 
B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [oh ,] [okay] [, [i] see .] 
B|115| B: [well [,] because] [my] , 
A|116| A: [five] hundred dollars [a] week . [for] [two] kids . 
B|117| B: [no .] 
A|118| A: [well ,] [right] [now] [we're] [just] renting [, but] [it is] [a] [home] . [um ,] 
B|119| B: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
A|120| A: [yeah .] 
B|121| B: [oh] . 
A|122| A: [because] even [if] [you said] , [okay] [, you know ,] armed forces _could_ [have] [them ,] [some] idiot [would] _come_ [out and] sell [it] [to] somebody [on the] street [to make] [a] quick buck . 
B|123| B: [yeah ,] [see] [, that's] [the same thing] [here] . 
A|124| A: [it's [,] uh [,] you know ,] getting ready [and] taking care [of] everything [. [but] it's [,] um [,] [it's] really] refreshing . [so ,] 
B|125| B: [yeah .] sometimes [i] wish [i] [could] [get] [one of these] [, uh ,] chemical services [to] [come] , [out and] spray [for] weeds [, and] fertilize [, [and] all] [that] [and] [take] [that] [one] step [out [of] .] 
A|126| A: [yes] 
B|127| B: [yeah [,] no [,] that] [would be] , what did [they] [do ,] everyone [come] around [and] watch [them] . 
A|128| A: [well [,] it] doesn't [make] sense . [because] [if] [they] [want] [people] [to] convert [, you know] . [they] should [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|129| B: [well [,] for] [some] [things .] 
A|130| A: [so] [there's] , everybody [had] deer coming [out] their ears . [so ,] 
B|131| B: [it [,] you know [,] you] still [have] [the [,] uh ,] [more] drug problems [and] [typical] [, uh ,] small city [type] problems ,
