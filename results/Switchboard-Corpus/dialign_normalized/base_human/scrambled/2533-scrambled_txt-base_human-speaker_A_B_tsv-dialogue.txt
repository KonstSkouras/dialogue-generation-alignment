B|27| B: [so] [i] called _four_ [or] _five_ dog trainers _because _i_ don't_ [like] [the] [little] dogs . 
A|28| A: [because] i'm always worrying [it] won't firm _up_ [because] _it _when_ you_ _take_ [it] _out of_ [the] saucepan [it's like] boy [i] hope _this_ thickens _a little_ [more] [because] [it's] _not_ [like] real package thick [you know] _when you_ cook [a] package _it's it's_ _a little_ less 
B|29| B: [yeah] fluid resistance . 
A|30| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [it's] incentive speaking [of] bush _we're_ [going to _get] a little_ off topic [but] speaking [of] bush [they] [that] [had a] _story_ where [he] _went_ [to] visit [some] [little] [uh] elementary _school_ students _and stuff_ .

A|34| A: tight turns _hard_ acceleration . _i've_ seen _a lot of_ mustangs [uh] compete [and] [it's] _interesting ._ [they] [get] dominated by [the] corvettes [that are] [also] [in] their class . 
B|35| B: [it] [it] _it's pretty_ [bad] _here_ [too] . 
A|36| A: [you know] [. uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: _that's_ what [i've] _heard_ . 
A|38| A: _right ._ 
B|39| B: [well] [my] _home_ _at_ _the moment_ [is] an apartment . 
A|40| A: [you know] . 
B|41| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] [things] [that] _we're_ _trying to_ worry _about_ [you know] protecting _these_ [people] [from] [we] [just] _don't_ protect [them] . 
A|42| A: [uh-huh .] [it] [sure] _is ._ [the] [you know] _as_ _far_ _as_ _i think_ there was [something] _with_ [the] government official [that] [went] [on] conferences [for] _two_ days [and] actually [uh] [the] conferences _were_ nothing [but uh] [you know] [they're] getting paid [for] _this_ [and] [it] was [something] [more] [than] [just] [the] conferences . [they] _were_ using _it as_ eating _out_ [uh] _when _you_ think_ [about] [people] [uh] taking vacations [these] _big_ government officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|43| B: quicker maybe _yeah ._ 
A|44| A: _yes ._ 
B|45| B: [uh] what _do [you_ think] ? 
A|46| A: [in] fact _i think_ [they're] getting [a] _different_ guy [for] [a] backup quarterback _. i_ haven't [uh] [i] haven't kept _up_ _with_ [it] lately [but] [i] remember reading [something] [a] few months ago [about] [them] signing somebody else [on] _or or_ [trying to] _go_ [after] somebody [or] trade [for] somebody [but] [it] wasn't anybody _i'd_ [really] [heard] _of [._ but] [i] [heard] [on the] radio _this_ morning [or] yesterday morning [that] [uh] aikman's back [in] practicing doing real real [well] . [um] who [is] [it] michael irvin 
B|47| B: [so] [i] [do] _love_ classical music [or] [it] [or or] [uh] contemporary classical . 
A|48| A: [oh] god . 
B|49| B: [and] _why_ can't [you] _why_ can't [the] f d [a] [say] [you know] [if] [these] [people] knowingly consent [to] [be] research monkeys [and] [well] _let_ [them] 
A|50| A: [and] [then] before [the] milk gets [too] hot [um] [i] add _two_ beaten eggs [and i] [really] mix [them in] good . [and] [then] _about a_ half [a] cup [of] sugar [and i] [let] [it] [pretty] _much_ [i] beat [it] [like] every minute [for] _about ten_ seconds [and] _it's it_ starts thickening _when it_ thickens [the] cornstarch might [get a little] [i don't [know] it] gets [like] [little] globs [of] _this_ rubbery cornstarch [and] _you just_ [keep] beating [it] [in] . [and] [it's] _the the_ trick [is] [is] [to] [have] _this_ blender [so] [if] [you] _were_ you'd [have] [to] probably almost _go_ _out and_ _someone_ who's [just] [going [to] make] [it] _first_ time [it's] you'll [have] _much_ better luck [if] _you had_ _one of these_ [little] blenders . [and] [then] [you] can add cocoa powder [to] [it] [to make] chocolate [or] [after] [it's] thickened [i] cook [it] [for] [a] good once [it] starts boiling [i] [just] [i] cook [it] [for] [a] good seven minutes seven [to] _ten_ minutes 
B|51| B: [well i] thought [i'd] [you know] [i'd] use [it as] [a] an escapement [type] [thing [.] [i] don't know] [if] you're familiar _with that_ operation [but] what _you do_ [is] [you just] build [up] [the] pressure 
A|52| A: wow . 
B|53| B: what [are] [they] [going] [up] [to] thirty bucks [or] [something] ? 
A|54| A: [uh-huh .] _right [._ uh-huh .] _right_ [because] [they're] [a] danger [to] everybody else . huh [that's] _interesting [._ i] [have] [to] [uh] agree [with _that] ._ 
B|55| B: [so] _at_ [one] [point] [i] [had a] snake skunk dog [and] cat running loose [in the] house . 
A|56| A: [but] [the] [four] bedrooms _and all_ [the] rest [of] [it] sounds [just] [about] [about] alike [. _i] think_ [it's pretty] _much_ _typical_ [for] _this_ area . 
B|57| B: _but [it's_ it's] [so] lonely [you know] [they] can't [get] [out and] [see] anyone [and [i] mean] [it's] [hard] [for] [for] [someone] [like] _me_ [to] understand [that] 
A|58| A: [oh] _no_ _no_ _no_ _no ._ 
B|59| B: _yeah ._ 
A|60| A: [yeah] [in] certain crimes . 
B|61| B: [uh] both 
A|62| A: [i] _kind of_ [uh] stopped listening [after] [a] while . 
B|63| B: _is that_ [so] _? i_ [didn't] _know [that_ .] 
A|64| A: [the] _i think_ [the] [i] guess [the] only real [um] benefit [i] guess [you] _could_ [say] working [for] [me] working [here] besides [i mean] i'm learning [and stuff] [because] i'm [at] [you know] [in] [school] . 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [yeah .] 
B|67| B: [yes .] [yes .] 
A|68| A: [i] [have] xanadu [and] precious [and] rascal . 
B|69| B: [oh] [it's _it] [is_ [.] i mean] [the the] number [of] single _family_ units [on] sale [is] phenomenal compared [to] [the] population . 
A|70| A: _so uh_ [that] [story] [i] [just] told [you] [about] [my] mother's beautiful cousin [well] _the same thing_ happened [here] [in] arlington _when_ was [it] _i think_ [it] was [oh] [it] was almost [a] [year] ago [in] december _to a_ girl [that] [my] daughter [had] graduated [from] high [school] [with] . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] _okay _._ well_ ... 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [oh] [i don't] [like] nineties . 
A|74| A: _right ._ 
B|75| B: [yeah] [well] [that] makes [a] [really] [big] difference [. but] [but] still [it's] [just] [as] [hard] [as] having [that] 
A|76| A: [but] [it is] nice [to] [have] [it] [because] _there's_ [uh] [with] our size [of] [family] [it's] nice [to] [know that] _there's one_ [that's] always straight [and] clean [if] _you have_ [someone] _come_ [just] [on the] spur [of] [the moment] . 
B|77| B: [now] _why_ [would] [you] [go [to] a] seafood restaurant [to] eat chicken ? 
A|78| A: [i don't] [think] [that's] [a] pleasure [for] anybody [the the] mowing . 
B|79| B: [not] [too] [much] . what [kind of] what [kind of] [things] _do you_ write ? 
A|80| A: forgot [about] [that .] 
B|81| B: _okay ._ 
A|82| A: huh-uh [. well] i'm [in] pennsylvania . 
B|83| B: [yeah] [the] [first] [first] couple [of times] [it's pretty] scary [but uh] [after] _that you_ realize [they are] [just] [as] [afraid of you] [too] . 
A|84| A: _have _you_ [have_ _have] you_ seen _this_ often ? 
B|85| B: [right .] 
A|86| A: _and they_ _were_ very helpful 
B|87| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|88| A: instead [of] being carried 
B|89| B: [uh] _do you know_ where [uh] custer [is] ? 
A|90| A: [yeah .] 
B|91| B: [yeah [.] i] [uh] those onions [i think] [we] [we] planted [like] twice [as] [much] [this] [year] [because] [you know] [we] [got] onions [and they] lasted [from] [you know] [about] [when you] harvest [them] [about a] month [from] [now] [or] [so] [or] six weeks [from] [now] until until [like] october 
A|92| A: [well] [it] can [get] expensive 
B|93| B: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [well] good [to] hear [. i] was [just] talking [to] [someone] [the other] day [from] pennsylvania . 
B|95| B: [lot [of] them] [are] former music teachers [or] currently teaching . [uh] others [have] [there's one] gal [that's] [in the] [uh] plano community orchestra . [uh just] [you know] [different] backgrounds . [it's] [been] [really] [kind of] [interesting .] 
A|96| A: [okay .] i'm [sure] [that i] probably [uh] prescribe [to] [different] magazines ones [that [you] do] 
B|97| B: [yeah] [it [when] it] comes [on the] manufacturing floor [it's] [about ten] bucks . 
A|98| A: real excited [when] [i] [heard] [this] . [so] _far_ [i've] [been] [trying to] _call_ _all_ day [because i] [keep] getting [these] subjects [like] capital punishment [so] football [i] [love] [this] . 
B|99| B: [so uh] 
A|100| A: nursing homes . 
B|101| B: _yeah yeah_ 
A|102| A: [and] [it's] probably [because i] [i] [i] was born [in the] chicago area [and] grew [up] [in] california [and] [at] [that] [point] [that] was sort [of] [the] limit [but] [since then] [i've] [been] abroad [a lot] 
B|103| B: [yeah .] 
A|104| A: [oh [yeah] yeah] [we] [do] [we] _call_ [that] doing biscuits

B|109| B: [yeah] [that's] [not] [too] [far] [from] [were] [we] live _do [you_ [have] _you] said_ [you had] [two] cats [are] [they] [um] [just] what [you] [call] [it] [are] [they] breed cats [or] anything [or] [are] [they] [just] 
A|110| A: _no_ [that's] [okay] 
B|111| B: [okay] 
A|112| A: wow . [why] [is that] ? [do you know] [? [i] mean] 
B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [oh] [okay] [i see .] 
B|115| B: [well] [because] [my] 
A|116| A: [five] hundred dollars [a] week . [for] [two] kids . 
B|117| B: [no .] 
A|118| A: [well] [right] [now] [we're] [just] renting [but] [it is] [a] [home] . [um] 
B|119| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
A|120| A: [yeah .] 
B|121| B: [oh] . 
A|122| A: [because] even [if] [you said] [okay] [you know] armed forces _could_ [have] [them] [some] idiot [would] _come out and_ sell [it] [to] somebody [on the] street [to make] [a] quick buck . 
B|123| B: [yeah] [see] [that's] [the same thing] [here] . 
A|124| A: [it's] [uh] [you know] getting ready [and] taking care [of] everything [. [but] it's] [um] [it's really] refreshing . [so] 
B|125| B: [yeah .] sometimes [i] wish [i] [could] [get] [one of these] [uh] chemical services [to] [come out and] spray [for] weeds [and] fertilize [and all] [that] [and] [take] [that] [one] step [out [of] .] 
A|126| A: [yes] 
B|127| B: [yeah] [no] [that] [would be] what did [they] [do] everyone [come] around [and] watch [them] . 
A|128| A: [well] [it] doesn't [make] sense . [because] [if] [they] [want] [people] [to] convert [you know] . [they] should [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|129| B: [well] [for] [some] [things .] 
A|130| A: [so] [there's] everybody [had] deer coming [out] their ears . [so] 
B|131| B: [it] [you know] [you] still [have] [the] [uh] [more] drug problems [and] [typical] [uh] small city [type] problems
