A|8| A: [but] _yeah _._ but_ [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] _what_ _i mean_ , _see_ [, but] [but] realistically [when] [you] _think_ _of it_ [it] _just_ sounds [like] such an _awful_ thing [, _and] it_ evokes an emotional response _. i think _that's_ the_ hardest thing _, i don't_ [know] [if] _i could_ ever _be_ [a] judge , _because_ [some] _things_ emotionally _just_ _aren't_ [you know] 
B|9| B: _and _you_ know , there's_ [a] big move , especially _in the_ industrial part [in] texas _right_ _now_ [of] controlling [the] c f c _that the_ big manufacturing companies _are_ producing into [the] air they're having _to_ change [the] type [of] products [they] _use_ 
A|10| A: _right ._ 
B|11| B: _yeah . _and_ then_ _, i was_ reading _in the paper_ [just] _this_ morning _, it's_ _interesting_ _because _i_ had_ forgotten [, i] guess _, that_ [i] wrote _this_ _little_ _topic_ down _, that_ [it] costs _more_ _to_ execute somebody than [it] does _to keep_ [them] . [because] [of] _all_ [the] costs _of the_ appeals _and all _that_ [you_ know] . 
A|12| A: _oh [,_ i] hear , _yes _,_ _that's_ true ._ 
B|13| B: _is_ _that_ [right] ? i'll heard _there_ _was_ [some] stuff _on _the_ ,_ _on the_ _radio_ _that was_ equivalent _to_ c n n . 
A|14| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [yeah .] 
A|16| A: eighty percent [of the] public , according [to] bill moyers' [, uh ,] recent [, uh ,] piece _for_ [, uh ,] public broadcasting _, which_ , [by] [the] _way_ [is a] _very_ _good_ [use] [of] government money _. i think_ p b _s is_ wonderful _. but_ [this] special focused [on the] _fact_ [that] eighty percent [of the] _people_ [in] [this] country [are] , [are] seeing _their_ [real] incomes [, and] thus , standards [of] _living_ , decline [. and] twenty percent [are] seeing theirs improve . [that's] [not a] formula _for a_ better society . 
B|17| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _uh , i_ wish [it] _were a_ [little] bit harder [to] [not] serve [on] juries _actually _._ _i_ mean_ [, _i] [know_ [,] _it] [,_ _it] [,_ it's] tricky _because i [know_ _,] you know ,_ an _awful_ _lot of_ intelligent _people_ who [just] [, well] _i'm_ _too_ busy [to] serve [on] [a] jury , 
B|19| B: [i] _do _,_ too [._ _i think] , i _think_ _a_ lot of_ [people] , _a lot_ _more_ [people] volunteer than , than [, uh ,] than _we_ , than _get_ credit [for] [it] _as_ [, you know ,] [like] [in] hospitals _and , uh [,_ _and] the_ shelters [and] stuff _like _that_ [._ and] _even_ [if] _it [is_ _a] couple_ times [a] year [like] _at_ [the] holidays _, i mean_ _at least_ they're getting _out_ [and] _doing_ [it] _and [you_ know ,] helping , helping _out_ [. i think that's] [good] _and ,_ 
A|20| A: [yeah .] [you know [,] i] read [, you know _,] when_ [they] first started [doing] [that] [in the paper] [, _and] i_ read _about_ _that [,_ i was] [just] praying _that [,_ that] [would] _be_ [in] _our_ area , [because] _we've been_ recycling [for] _quite_ [some] _time [._ [and] [,] you know _,] we_ separate everything [out] [, [and] then] _have_ [to] haul [it] [up to] [a] metco [, you know _,] which_ [is a] [real] pain . 
B|21| B: _and we_ go along [and _,] i'm_ _really_ [not] _sure_ [how] [we] find [the] individuals [, but] [we] find older _people that_ cannot afford [to] fix [up] [their] homes [that] desperately _need_ [it [,] _and] , uh [,_ we] go along with _all_ [the] material [and] [in] _one_ _day_ , _more_ _or_ less , go [in] [and] _say_ , roof , paint , fix whatever [we] [can] . 
A|22| A: [and [the] _,] _so_ [,_ but] _we've_ [had] budgets [that] _didn't_ work [when] _our_ _, uh , you know [,_ _of] our_ first _fifteen years_ [or] eighteen _years_ [of] being married nothing worked 
B|23| B: [that's] _one of_ _those _things_ _i_ got_ famous [for] [in] college . [people] [would] come [and] _say_ [could] [would] [you] come _over_ [and] _make_ lasagna [for] _me_ 
A|24| A: _oh ,_ [yeah .] 
B|25| B: _but , you know ,_ escort [is] supposed _to _have_ a_ great track record _as_ far _as_ sales . 
A|26| A: _oh ,_ huh . 
B|27| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: huh . [uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [yes] . 
A|30| A: [sure] . 
B|31| B: [oh _,] i'm _,_ i'm_ [a] dog person [. _i] had [,_ i] guess _it depends on what_ [you] [had] [when] _he_ [were a] kid , [right] ? 
A|32| A: _well _,_ in the_ winter _time_ [, i] _can see_ , _see_ another guy [but , you know ,] _he's_ 
B|33| B: _make_ [sure] [we] _get_ [our] cash flow . 
A|34| A: [that's] sweet [, i] [have] [the] two _, the_ other two _cats_ [i] [have] [are] outdoor _cats_ . 
B|35| B: [what] _, what_ _is ,_ _do _you_ have a_ favorite recipe ? 
A|36| A: [but] [it [,] but] again [, [it] depends on what] job _you're_ _in ._ 
B|37| B: [that's] [awful] 
A|38| A: [he] [is] [in] new jersey [and] [is] entrepreneur [and] [kind of a] self-made millionaire [. [and] ,] _he has_ [it _,] i [,_ well] [it's] five seventy [here [,] i'm] trying [to] [, it's] [on] cliff _, i don't_ [know] [what] [the ,] _he's_ [on] [all] stations . [you] might remember [the] name bruce williams [, _and] he_ , [he] [is] again , national [and] talks _about_ [a lot of] financial [things] _. but _,_ the_ [here [,] i] [just] [get] [a] kick _out [of_ , uh [,] well] [we] [do] [a lot of] gardening [here _,] so_ [there's] [, _we] have_ an excellent gardener [here ,] _has_ _three_ hours [on] sunday [and] _three_ hours [on] saturday . [of course] [that's] [not] exactly current events _. but _, i_ [,_ i'm [,] [i] am] [kind of a] [radio] buff . 
B|39| B: [uh ,] father's . my mother's father's family [had] [quite] [a] few [, uh ,] brothers [and] sisters . 
A|40| A: [uh-huh] [, it] [sure] [would] _. it_ [would] [have] _to be_ [a lot [of] [,] you know ,] thought given [to] _something_ _like that [,_ i] [would] [think] . 
B|41| B: [we've been] [fifteen] , [fifteen years] [in [the] [,] in the] _house that_ _we're_ [living] [in .] 
A|42| A: _well [,_ not] [the] rain _so_ much _as the_ cool _, the_ other mornings [when] _it was_ [like] sixty-five _when we_ woke [up] [and] sixty-six [, and] today _i know_ _when [i_ got] [up] [that the] temperature said [more] [like] , _close_ , seventy-nine [or] eighty 
B|43| B: [what] [about] [you] ? 
A|44| A: _well [,_ i] [really] [do [,] i think] [you have] [to] budget [those things] though . 
B|45| B: [yes [,] i think] _most_ states [do] [have] capital punishment . [yes] [. but [, i] think] [the] u [s is] _one of the_ few countries [that] _still_ [do] . 
A|46| A: _i ,_ _yeah [, [i_ think] , i think] [this] _was ,_ [this] _was a_ _very_ [interesting] [topic] [uh ,] [because] [it's] _something_ _that [,_ you know [,] we] _don't_ talk [about] [in] [this] country [probably] enough . 
B|47| B: _yeah , _it's_ [like_ that] [good] [for] us [just] [because] my uncle [and] my [, and] my mom _switch_ off _like [we_ have] her [for] [three] months [and then] [he has] her [for] [three] months . 
A|48| A: [i] _did_ [too] [, [and] [you] have a] [good] [day] . 
B|49| B: [you know] [it's] [so] exciting . 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] [that's] [what] [it is] [here ,] [yeah _,] that's_ _why_ [we're] [at] [a] point [now] [we've] [, uh ,] [we're] adopting [and [we] have] [been] married ten plus [years] [and] [what] happens [is _, uh ,] you_ [just] realize [that] once [you] _get to_ [a] certain age [the] next [house [that] you] [get] we'll _be_ staying [in] [yeah ,] 
B|51| B: [right] , absolutely . 
A|52| A: exactly _. we_ saw , [yes [,] you know ,] twenty [years] ago , thirty [years] ago [, we] wouldn't [have] [been] able [to have] [that] privilege [or] , [or] luxury [to] , [to] view [that _.] so_ . 
B|53| B: [yeah .] [probably] [that's true [.] _but] [i_ know] [a lot of] [their] , [a lot of] [their] specials _sometimes_ [are] fried [things] [, [that] you] can't [really] [get] away _from_ [the] fried , 
A|54| A: [yeah .] _yeah , i_ [would] [think , i] [would] [think a] cave [would] _be_ , [could] [have] problems _like that [,_ too .] 
B|55| B: [not] [, not] [, you know [,] the] bouncy [, you know] sing along [kind] [but] [some] [of _the] old_ , older ones [that] 
A|56| A: _well ,_ _no_ , [would] _they ,_ _no_ . 
B|57| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|58| A: [a] cottage industry's [the] best _way_ [to] [do] [it] _really ,_ [because] [if] [you] [over] , 
B|59| B: [i mean] [they] go [right] back _where they_ came _from_ . 
A|60| A: [yeah .] [that's] _right ._ 
B|61| B: [oh _,] _well ,_ they , they_ come [out] with [a lot of] bruises [too .] 
A|62| A: _i don't_ [know _,] uh [, i_ was] [just] going [to] [say] _something_ [, i] forgot [what] _it was_ _. oh _,_ i don't_ [even] remember [what] _it was_ [now] . 
B|63| B: [that's the] only [way] [i could] [really ,] 
A|64| A: [so] [i] figure [that] [that] will [make] [me] biased _and i_ won't _be_ chosen . 
B|65| B: [yeah ,] she's [the] oldest [. and] she [, well] [in] [fact] [i got] her [when i] moved [out [of] the] [house] also . 
A|66| A: [yeah [,] well [,] i] _i , i don't_ [know [,] i] definitely [feel [like] we] [need] [to keep] [it] [at least] unanimous [because] _, uh , you know , there's_ [the] classic sort [of] [to] kill [a] mockingbird [kind of] [story] [where] [you] _get [,_ you know ,] 
B|67| B: [yes [,] [it] is] _. uh ,_ unfortunately [i] [need] [all] [of it] . 
A|68| A: [but] [you] shouldn't , what's [the old] _saying_ [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book [by] its cover . 
B|69| B: [oh .] 
A|70| A: [oh ,] [yeah , it's] [been] [, it's] [been] [, it's] [been] ten days already [and] [there] [are] [still] _something_ [like] ten thousand [people] without power . 
B|71| B: [we] [just] [had] [a] bunch [of] [people] [over] [and we] _had [,_ we] [did] lasagna [and] garlic bread _and , uh ,_ yummy . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh] [, [that] was] [one of the] [most] wonderful vacations [i've] ever [had] . 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [and you] [, [and] you] [, you know] [the ,] 
B|75| B: [yeah , i] housesat _from_ [cats] [for a] friend [of] mine [which] she [was] finishing [up] her thesis , 
A|76| A: _and [i_ had [,] you know [,] i] knew [some] [people that] said , _why_ [are] [you] glad [, you] [you know ,] [this] [is] nothing [, _and] i_ said [just] maybe [because] [he _got] [a_ lot of] media hype [and all that] [but i] [actually] [, i mean] [in] [there] should _be_ [more] cases [like that] [where they] flip [a] [i] might _be_ [too] cold [too] [, but] [they] flip [a] [switch] , 
B|77| B: [oh ,] [really] ? [i] [didn't] [know] [that .] 
A|78| A: [yeah . [and] ,] again _, i don't_ [, i mean] [got] [know] [the [,] you know [,] how] qualified [, i mean] [, i think] it'd _be_ [interesting] [to] [, you know ,] [to] spend [a couple of] days [just] looking around an inner city school [. _uh ,] you know ,_ sort , sort [of] maybe [from] elementary through [, uh ,] high school . [you know ,] [just] sort [of] _to get_ [a] [feel] [for] [what] [it's like] . 
B|79| B: [oh] 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [yeah .] 
A|82| A: huh . 
B|83| B: [and] [so [,] uh [,] it's] [not] [quite] [as] [close] [as] [it] used [to be] [. [so] [,] i think] [people] [feel] less [of a] desire [to] [really] go [. [i] know] [that ,] 
A|84| A: [that ,] [um [,] i] wonder [sometimes] 
B|85| B: [right .] [when] [you're] [saying] [as] far [as the] appeal [, uh ,] procedure [was] concerned . 
A|86| A: [course] [it] doesn't always work [out] [in] [their] favor . 
B|87| B: [yeah , [i] got] [to] take care [of a] friend [of] mine's dog . [he's] [just] [got a] puppy [and he] [was] [out of] town last weekend [and] [of course] [the] dog [is] [not] trained [for] anything yet [, so] [it [was] ,] go [over] [there] [and] clean [up] after [the] dog , 
A|88| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: [because [i] think] there're [so] many parts [of the] _district_ [where] [it's] [not] [very] safe [to get] [out] [and] walk . 
A|90| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: [you] [can see] [that] horrible , horrible brown haze . 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [oh [.] it] wasn't [actually [.] [it] [,] [when] we] [were] [in] oahu [, uh , i] couldn't wait [to get] off [we] [, we] took [a] cruise [and we] went [to] four different islands [and [it] [was] a] [really] nice , kauai [was] nice [and] maui [was] nice [. we] [had [,] we] [had] [a] great [time .] 
A|94| A: [yeah .] 
B|95| B: [a lot [of] our] words [are] [the] same , 
A|96| A: [yeah .] 
B|97| B: [you] [too .] 
A|98| A: we'll [see] . 
B|99| B: [oh [.] oh ,] [good] . 
A|100| A: [so] [i] found [this] [one] [and , uh [,] actually] [it was] [on] [a] sign [at] taco bell drive-thru [that] said free kittens . 
B|101| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [uh [,] what] [kind [of] [,] what] [kind of] work [do you] [do] ? 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: [and [i] know] [it ,] [there] [is [,] it's] [very] easy [to [get] [,] uh [,] uh , you know , there's] [no] restrictions , whatsoever , [on] hunting rifles [and] shotguns [and] [things] [like that [,] which] [aren't] [the [,] [i ,] i don't] consider [to be] [the] [kind of] crime [, uh ,] weapon [, you know ,] 
A|106| A: [oh ,] [yeah] ? 
B|107| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [and i] worked [in] [a] [very] rural school [district] [and [i] [, i] [,] [one] of the] [things i] taught [was a] computer class 
B|109| B: [they] treat [it] with chemicals [or] [something] ? [why] can't trees break down ? [i don't] [get] [it] . 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] [well , they _, they] just_ [don't] [do] [that] any [more] . 
B|111| B: [oh [,] well [,] that's] [good] [because i know] they've [been] [really] expensive lately . [because] [they] weren't [in] season , 
B|112| B: [and] [there's] [no] family [there] [, they] [don't] [get to] [see] [their] grandkids [, they] [don't] [get to] [see] [their] children [, they just] [there] [in] [that] [house] .
