A|54| A: [i mean] _they're_ nomadic farmers _, you know , they're_ people who farm [on] [the] hillside [and] [then] leave [the] hillside [to] another hillside [and] farm [on that] hillside . 
B|55| B: [that's] [, uh [,] yeah _,] really_ [true [.] but] [like the] friends , other friends [of] mine [have] cats _, they have_ four [of them , and] [if] [they] [go] away _, they have_ [, they] hire [a] pet sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] [day] [and] pet [them] [and] [things] [like] [that] [and] their cats [, you know , they're] [so] _used to_ [the] attention , [that] [if] [they] [don't] [get] [it [,] they] [get] [really] upset , 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [uh ,] every person [has] their opinions [and that's] [why] jury selection [is] often very difficult [. uh] .

A|76| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [i think] [it] must [have] been terribly boring [to [go] [through] ,] [your] life [doing] [just] [one] thing [for] fifty years [or] forty years .

B|93| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [and , uh , we] were [never] [much] [of] [, uh [,] a] very [, uh ,] family thing [, you know ,] [made] , [like] [go] skiing [in] vermont [or] [something] . 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .]
