B|3| B: _well _,_ it's , uh _,_ it's_ _really_ both . _i'm_ certainly driven _by_ [the] desire _to_ maintain [my] _weight_ [and] _be_ _healthy_ [and] _be_ [in] _shape_ _, and , uh _,_ and_ most _of the_ _time_ [i] enjoy _it ._ _sometimes_ _i _don't_ _,_ but i_ _feel_ _that_ [, uh _,] that_ [the] discipline _it_ affords _me _when_ [i_ _do] it_ _when _i_ don't_ _want to_ [is] also worth _something_ . 
A|4| A: _anyway_ [, it's] _a_ tough question . 
B|5| B: _yeah ._ 
A|6| A: [my] mother _got_ _a_ piano [and , uh ,] vowed [that] someone _in the_ family _was_ going [to] learn _, _so_ we_ all _had_ [to] _take_ lessons _, and i_ _was _the_ one that_ _did_ [the] least poorly _, so_ she gave [it] [to] [me] _. and_ [it's] sitting _here_ mostly taking up space [, but] [sometimes] [it] makes _you_ [feel] _good_ [to] sit _down_ [and] play [it .] [it] [is] real relaxing . 
B|7| B: [yeah _,] well [,_ you know ,] 
A|8| A: _i've_ tried _to do_ [that] _with_ sugar 
B|9| B: [and] _a lot of_ _people_ [that] _are_ [a] danger [to] society [that] aren't [in] prison . 
A|10| A: _the _,_ the_ investigator . [yeah ,] _he_ , _he_ _got_ off _right_ away . 
B|11| B: [and] [we] [got] [, uh [,] [the] one that] [my] parents [have] [is] _an_ apple _two_ e . 
A|12| A: _uh-huh ._ 
B|13| B: _so _i_ think_ _for ,_ _for ,_ _for_ _many_ years [, uh _,] we've_ _paid_ teachers [and] police officers [and] firemen _who_ _are_ [, uh _,] to_ _a great_ extent , public servants [uh _,] we _have_ not_ _paid_ _them_ _really_ _what_ _they're_ worth [in] _what_ _they_ contribute [to] society . 
A|14| A: [so] _one of the_ real keys _, it_ sounds _like_ [, to] getting recycling [for [,] uh ,] _paper_ _or_ [something] _like_ [that] _to go_ [is] _to get_ some sort [of] business [to] actually [want] [it] once _you have_ collected [it .] 
B|15| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: _um , i_ forget how she [got] _it [,_ but] _it _was_ , um _,_ _it was_ _the_ same_ kind _of a_ deal [i think] she [got] _it _,_ i think_ she _was_ [a] psych major [and] she [got] [it] from [the] psych department . 
B|17| B: jerry burns . 
A|18| A: _and then_ _he_ _was_ gaining [weight] again , _was_ _just_ getting [healthy] [, and , uh ,] _he_ _put_ _on_ _about_ fifteen [to] twenty pounds after [the] thing _and then_ _he_ [got] hit [by] [a] cadillac . 
B|19| B: _and the_ average _, you know , the_ average [, uh _,] first_ frost [is] [like] [the] fifteenth [of] november [here] 
A|20| A: [i _think] _that_ was_ _just_ [a] regulation _that was_ up [for] comment [, but] we'll _see_ [what] happens . 
B|21| B: [so] [he] hasn't _really_ gotten _into_ [, um _,] that_ yet . _they have_ choir _that they_ [go] _to [,_ you know ,] music class _that they_ [go] [to] 
A|22| A: _well , um ,_ actually _it [,_ we've] sort [of] _had_ [an] ideal spring . 
B|23| B: _that's_ _really_ true . 
A|24| A: no _, not_ [in] _, not_ [in] [well] [not] [in] dallas [, _that] is_ . 
B|25| B: _oh_ . 
A|26| A: _if it_ finally _gets_ [to] [that] point . 
B|27| B: [and [, uh ,] you know [,] that] vote's [just] _as good_ _as_ _, you know , [the_ one] [on] election day . 
A|28| A: [who] [is] [that] ? 
B|29| B: [right] . _could_ [you] change [that] _as_ [you] felt [like] [it] [or] [did] [you have] _to do it_ [the same] every week ? 
A|30| A: [um] . 
B|31| B: _and they're_ [go] around [and] collect cans [and] aluminum [and] _stuff_ , 
A|32| A: [well ,] _oh ,_ hobbies , gee whiz _, i_ guess [i] [got] _too_ [many] hobbies [so i] never [have] [time] [to] deal _with_ [them] . 
B|33| B: _so _, uh , _i_ think_ the_ jury selection _process_ [is] pretty neat _, but _i_ don't_ [think that] [the] jury ought [to] _be_ [the] _ones_ picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| B: okay . 
A|36| A: [and] [we've] [, we have] been [to] whistler [in] canada , which [is] [just] [a] marvelous place , whistler [and] black home [is] [in] canada _, and then_ [we've] gone [to] sun valley several times _, _that's_ a_ , [just] [a great] place _. but_ no [not] [in] colorado since [i] _was_ [in] college , since [i] went [to] school , 
B|37| B: [well ,] [good] _talking to_ [you] [too] . bye , 
A|38| A: he's gone _three_ weeks _right now_ [and] [that's] _, that's_ mild compare _to the_ _big_ [ones] , 
B|39| B: [uh [,] _and] that_ _probably_ gives us [a] _better_ insight _as_ [to the] city [of] raleigh [than] , [than] [the] [paper] _would_ [have] _anyway ._ 
A|40| A: [great] . [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [right] . [uh-huh] [oh] [now] [that's a] [big] win . 
A|42| A: _yes_ 
B|43| B: [yeah [,] we] used _to [,_ that's] _one of the , um ,_ entrances [to the] periphery [to get] [in] [and] _out_ [of the] city . 
A|44| A: [you] [feel] invigorated [and] [you] [feel] _oh [,_ you] [feel] [in] [a lot] [better] [shape] [just] [like] eating [right] foods . 
B|45| B: [we [have] _,] uh , uh ,_ four rooms downstairs [, and] [a] pantry 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: _but , uh [,_ that's] _about_ [it] _there_ . 
B|49| B: [well] _yeah _, i_ _don't_ _,_ i don't_ _care_ _for the_ smell [of the] litter box [so] [my] cat [was] trained [to go] outside , _other_ [than] [that] [it was] inside _when_ [it] wanted [to] _be [,_ it was] outside _when_ . 
A|50| A: [and] [in] [talking [to] _the] people_ from france [he] _said_ [, you know ,] [he] says , [one of the] things [that] [really] concerns [me] [is] your _government_ [is] [not] telling [you] enough _about_ how _it and_ frightening this epidemic [is] _. [and_ they're] letting [, the] information [out] slowly _about_ how [, you know ,] how [big] [it] [is] . 
B|51| B: [well , [um _,] i] [,_ uh ,] exercise regularly _. i_ work _at_ [a] university [, and i] swim _almost_ every day upwards [of a] mile , 
A|52| A: [yeah .] [on] [that] [same] topic , _have you ever_ read anything _about_ [, you know , the] amelia earhart story , _whatever_ _happened_ _with_ her ? 
B|53| B: [uh ,] 
A|54| A: [and] _there was_ [a] [paper] presented [at] this conference from [a] _guy_ from alabama [and] [he] [was] kind [of] hired [to do] [a] study [by] [two] departments [for _the] government_ . [one] [was] [like] , environmental protection [and _the] other_ [one] _was ,_ _oh , i_ can't remember [what] [, but] [the] basic idea [, it was] presented [to] him [was] how can [we] maximize [the] amount [of] energy [that] [we] can [get] back from recycling [and] minimize [the] volume [of] [stuff] [that] [we] [are] putting [into] _our_ landfill 
B|55| B: [oh [,] [that] was] [good] . utah _, i've_ [had] [a] couple _of [,_ but] [that was] [it .] 
A|56| A: [so [,] um [,] well [,] i] [have _not] really_ [paid] _much_ attention _because i_ clock , although [i think] [we've] [probably] been [talking] [at] least ten minutes [so [,] um _,] if_ [you] [, um ,] unless [you have] some [other] things [you] [want to] talk _about_ [as] having [to do] _with_ p c 
B|57| B: [and [,] _and i] think_ [, you know ,] 
A|58| A: [that's] [the] part [that] scares [me] _, you know [._ _i] mean_ beginning _with_ this [is] , this [is] [just] [for] homosexuals [, well] no [, it's] [for] homosexuals [and] gays [, well] no , actually [, it's _,] i mean _,_ you know ._ [did] [they] _know that_ all along ? 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [and [, uh [,] i] don't] [know] exactly how we're going [to] cover [many] [of] these [people] _, because_ [i'm] sure [that] some [of] [them] [don't [,] uh ,] _don't have_ [the] wherewithal [to do it] themselves _, [so_ , uh [, i] [,] i] [have] [a] feeling , since [i] [have] [just] _about_ [as good] [a] health [care] coverage [that] anybody can [get] [, that] this [, uh _,] then_ becomes [an] obligation [of _the] government _,_ because it's_ going [to] become [an] obligation [of] either state , local [or] federal _government ,_ [anyway .] 
B|61| B: [but] whether [or] [not] _it would be , uh ,_ [our] money _would be_ [better] spent [, uh ,] teaching [, you know ,] working [on] [the] drug problems [and [the] _,] and the_ sex problems [, uh ,] rather [than] trying [to] cure [the people] [that] already [have] [it .] 
A|62| A: [and [i think] the] last [one] [i] read [like] [that was] scott thurow's [and [that] was] presumed innocent . 
B|63| B: [oh ,] [really] . 
A|64| A: [yeah _, i] think it_ [could] affect [the] outcome [, you know ,] [could] make [it] unfair . 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [and] [who] , how _about_ [you] ? 
B|67| B: [and] [so [i] ,] 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [i mean] [there [was] , um ,] [people] [at] stanford [who] were soaking [the government [,] you know ,] using millions [of] dollars [of] research money _to , uh ,_ [for the] president [to] buy beach homes [or] [whatever] [it was] . 
A|70| A: _so ._ 
B|71| B: [but [,] i] love [it [.] i] love [the] culture [, uh [,] the] _way_ _that _they_ [,_ uh _,] they_ respect education [and] their teachers their parents [, so] [much] [more] [than] , [than] [my] _children_ [do _.] you know ,_ 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [oh] [yes] [. [but] , uh [,] we] wouldn't [we] wouldn't [have] [them] [, i mean [,] i don't] [see] us without pets , without cats . 
A|74| A: [uh ,] some veggies [in] [it .] 
B|75| B: [and [,] and] [for] [them] [that's] wonderful [, you know .] _they _,_ they_ thought [it was the] greatest fun [, you _know ,] and it_ didn't cost any money _. and [, uh ,_ you] [don't have] _quite_ [as] [much] money _when_ _, when_ [the] wife _doesn't_ work . 
A|76| A: yep [, [they] ,] [a lot [of] [,] um ,] [of a] [, um ,] winter produce comes from south america . 
B|77| B: [so we] [said] [the] next [time] around we'd [get] [something] little [that] [if] [something] [happened] [, _it] would be_ easier [to] carry . 
A|78| A: [yeah ,] [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [yeah .] i'd [like] [to] [see] [the] death penalty [more] [as] [a] deterrent [, i think] [people] [know that] _nobody_ [, that] [it] _doesn't_ _, you know , _it's_ not_ [a] deterrent [right now] [, because _it's] [not_ really] effective . 
A|80| A: _but , um [,_ um [,] but [i] mean [,] [they] have] [one of the , um [,] when] [they] [said] log cabin [, i] [just] laughed [, [that] they] retired [to [,] but] [they] built [one of] these [. [i] mean [,] it's] [just] beautiful . [it's] [like] [a] custom [, you know] [it's not] [like] [what] [i] [would] [think] [of] [when [i] think] [of] old log cabins [. you know [,] i mean [,] it's] modern [it's ,] 
B|81| B: [so .] 
A|82| A: [that's] [great] . 
B|83| B: [right] [, that's] true . [or] even [have you ever] seen _where_ [they ,] they'll [take] [a] watermelon [and] [just] cut [the] top [out] [of] [it [and] then] hollow [that] [out] [, and then] [put] [the] fruit [in the] watermelon [that is] [really] neat . 
A|84| A: [but] [my] husband does [and [, uh ,] i think] [one of the [,] uh ,] [my] [, first] [of] all , always salary [and the] second thing [is] [, uh [,] because] [we have] [children] [, so] [it would be , uh ,] health benefits [and] medical benefits [and] [and , uh ,] [right now] [we have] [probably] some excellent benefits [right now] . 
B|85| B: [but , uh [,] [if] [it] [,] uh ,] [gets] [down] between [two] [, then] i'll , i'll vote [for the] party [because _i] know [,_ you know ,] [something] [about] [the other] [guy] 
A|86| A: [we] [don't [,] we] [don't] [do] enough [. [i] know] [we] [don't] [so] [uh ,] although lately [i've] been [, uh ,] [a] friend [of] mine [that] [i] spend [a lot of] [time] _with_ does recycle [quite] [a] bit [and] [it's [,] it's [,] it's , uh ,] interesting [to] watch some [of the] things [that] she does [and then] she's [almost] [had] [an] impact [on] [me] [, uh ,] [where] she [doesn't] say anything [to] [me when] she comes [to] [my] house [but i] can kind [of] tell [it] bothers her [so ,] [just] unconsciously [i've] [, i've] stopped buying [a lot [of] [,] uh , uh ,] [paper] plates [and] [paper] cups [and [i] don't] [do] [that] anymore [. [i] don't] [know] why [, i] [just] [don't] [i] [just] , [just] from socializing _with_ her [so .] 
B|87| B: [oh [, i] think [it] would] [, [it] would be] [a lot of] work [but , um [,] you know [,] because [it's] [,] you know ,] 
A|88| A: [i [know ,] and [it] [,] and the] economy [here] [in] dallas [, i mean [,] [it] [,] it's] steady [, but] [it's] still [not] going up .

B|93| B: wow . [uh-huh .]
