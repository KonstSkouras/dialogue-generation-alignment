B|3| B: _well_ _it's uh_ [it's] _really_ both . _i'm_ certainly driven _by_ [the] desire _to_ maintain [my] _weight_ [and] _be_ _healthy and_ _be_ [in] _shape_ _and uh_ [and] most _of the_ _time_ [i] enjoy _it ._ _sometimes_ _i don't_ _but i_ _feel_ _that_ [uh] _that_ [the] discipline _it_ affords _me _when_ [i_ _do] it_ _when _i_ don't_ _want to_ [is] also worth _something_ .

A|14| A: [so] _one of the_ real keys [it] sounds _like to_ getting recycling [for] [uh] _paper_ _or_ [something] _like_ [that] _to go_ [is] _to get_ some sort [of] business [to] actually [want] [it] once _you have_ collected [it .] 
B|15| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|16| A: _um i_ forget how she [got] [it] [but] _it _was_ um_ _it was _the_ same_ kind _of a_ deal [i think] she [got] [it] [i think] she _was_ [a] psych major [and] she [got] [it] from [the] psych department . 
B|17| B: jerry burns . 
A|18| A: _and then_ _he_ _was_ gaining [weight] again _was_ _just_ getting [healthy [and] uh] _he_ _put_ _on_ _about_ fifteen [to] twenty pounds after [the] thing _and then_ _he_ [got] hit [by] [a] cadillac .

A|20| A: [i _think] _that_ was_ _just_ [a] regulation _that was_ up [for] comment [but] we'll _see_ [what] happens .

B|33| B: _so _uh _i_ think_ the_ jury selection _process_ [is] pretty neat _but _i_ don't_ [think that] [the] jury ought [to] _be_ [the] _ones_ picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| B: okay . 
A|36| A: [and] [we've] [we have] been [to] whistler [in] canada which [is] [just] [a] marvelous place whistler [and] black home [is] [in] canada _and then_ [we've] gone [to] sun valley several times _that's a_ [just] [a great] place _. but_ no [not] [in] colorado since [i] _was_ [in] college since [i] went [to] school

A|38| A: he's gone _three_ weeks _right now_ [and] [that's] [that's] mild compare _to the_ _big_ [ones] 
B|39| B: [uh] _and that_ _probably_ gives us [a] _better_ insight _as_ [to the] city [of] raleigh [than] [than] [the] [paper] _would_ [have] _anyway ._ 
A|40| A: [great] . [yeah .] 
B|41| B: [right] . [uh-huh] [oh] [now] [that's a] [big] win . 
A|42| A: _yes_ 
B|43| B: [yeah] [we] used [to] [that's] _one of the um_ entrances [to the] periphery [to get] [in] [and] _out_ [of the] city . 
A|44| A: [you] [feel] invigorated [and] [you] [feel] [oh] [you] [feel] [in] [a lot] [better] [shape] [just] [like] eating [right] foods . 
B|45| B: [we have] _uh uh_ four rooms downstairs [and] [a] pantry 
A|46| A: [yeah .] 
B|47| B: [yeah .] 
A|48| A: _but uh_ [that's] _about_ [it] _there_ . 
B|49| B: [well] _yeah _i_ _don't_ _i_ don't_ _care_ _for the_ smell [of the] litter box [so] [my] cat [was] trained [to go] outside _other_ [than] [that] [it was] inside _when_ [it] wanted [to] _be_ [it was] outside _when_ . 
A|50| A: [and] [in] [talking [to] _the] people_ from france [he] _said_ [you know] [he] says [one of the] things [that] [really] concerns [me] [is] your _government_ [is] [not] telling [you] enough _about_ how _it and_ frightening this epidemic [is] _. [and_ they're] letting [the] information [out] slowly _about_ how [you know] how [big] [it] [is] . 
B|51| B: [well [um] i] [uh] exercise regularly _. i_ work _at_ [a] university [and i] swim _almost_ every day upwards [of a] mile 
A|52| A: [yeah .] [on] [that] [same] topic _have you ever_ read anything _about_ [you know the] amelia earhart story _whatever_ _happened_ _with_ her ? 
B|53| B: [uh] 
A|54| A: [and] _there was_ [a] [paper] presented [at] this conference from [a] _guy_ from alabama [and] [he] [was] kind [of] hired [to do] [a] study [by] [two] departments [for _the] government_ . [one] [was] [like] environmental protection [and _the] other_ [one] [was] _oh i_ can't remember [what] [but] [the] basic idea [it was] presented [to] him [was] how can [we] maximize [the] amount [of] energy [that] [we] can [get] back from recycling [and] minimize [the] volume [of] [stuff] [that] [we] [are] putting [into] _our_ landfill 
B|55| B: [oh] [that was] [good] . utah [i've] [had] [a] couple [of] [but] [that was] [it .] 
A|56| A: [so] [um] [well] [i] [have _not] really_ [paid] _much_ attention _because i_ clock although [i think] [we've] [probably] been [talking] [at] least ten minutes [so] [um] _if_ [you] [um] unless [you have] some [other] things [you] [want to] talk _about_ [as] having [to do] _with_ p c 
B|57| B: _and _and_ i think_ [you know] 
A|58| A: [that's] [the] part [that] scares [me] _you know [._ _i] mean_ beginning _with_ this [is] this [is] [just] [for] homosexuals [well] no [it's] [for] homosexuals [and] gays [well] no actually [it's] _i mean_ _you know ._ [did] [they] [know that] all along ? 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: [and [uh] [i] don't] [know] exactly how we're going [to] cover [many] [of] these [people] _because_ [i'm] sure [that] some [of] [them] [don't] [uh] _don't have_ [the] wherewithal [to do it] themselves [so uh i] [i] [have] [a] feeling since [i] [have] [just] _about_ [as good] [a] health [care] coverage [that] anybody can [get] [that] this [uh] _then_ becomes [an] obligation [of _the] government_ _because it's_ going [to] become [an] obligation [of] either state local [or] federal _government_ [anyway .] 
B|61| B: [but] whether [or] [not] _it would be uh_ [our] money _would be_ [better] spent [uh] teaching [you know] working [on] [the] drug problems [and the] [and the] sex problems [uh] rather [than] trying [to] cure [the people] [that] already [have] [it .] 
A|62| A: [and [i think] the] last [one] [i] read [like] [that was] scott thurow's [and [that] was] presumed innocent . 
B|63| B: [oh] [really] . 
A|64| A: [yeah _i] think it_ [could] affect [the] outcome [you know] [could] make [it] unfair . 
B|65| B: [yeah .] 
A|66| A: [and] [who] how _about_ [you] ? 
B|67| B: [and] [so i] 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [i mean] [there [was] um] [people] [at] stanford [who] were soaking [the government] [you know] using millions [of] dollars [of] research money _to uh_ [for the] president [to] buy beach homes [or] [whatever] [it was] . 
A|70| A: _so ._ 
B|71| B: _but i_ love [it [.] i] love [the] culture [uh] [the] _way_ _that they_ [uh] [they] respect education [and] their teachers their parents [so] [much] [more] [than] [than] [my] _children_ [do _.] you know_ 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [oh] [yes] [. [but] uh] [we] wouldn't [we] wouldn't [have] [them] [i mean] [i don't] [see] us without pets without cats . 
A|74| A: [uh] some veggies [in] [it .] 
B|75| B: _and and_ [for] [them] [that's] wonderful [you know .] [they] [they] thought [it was the] greatest fun [you _know] and it_ didn't cost any money _. and [uh_ you] [don't have] _quite_ [as] [much] money _when_ _when_ [the] wife _doesn't_ work . 
A|76| A: yep [they] [a lot of] [um] [of a] [um] winter produce comes from south america . 
B|77| B: [so we] [said] [the] next [time] around we'd [get] [something] little [that] [if] [something] [happened] _it would be_ easier [to] carry . 
A|78| A: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [yeah .] i'd [like to] [see] [the] death penalty [more] [as] [a] deterrent [i think] [people] [know that] _nobody_ [that] [it] _doesn't_ _you know it's not_ [a] deterrent [right now] [because _it's] [not_ really] effective . 
A|80| A: _but um_ [um] [but [i] mean] [they have] [one of the um] [when] [they] [said] log cabin [i] [just] laughed [that they] retired [to] [but] [they] built [one of] these [. [i] mean] [it's] [just] beautiful . [it's] [like] [a] custom [you know it's not] [like] [what] [i] [would] [think] [of] [when [i] think] [of] old log cabins [. you know] [i mean] [it's] modern [it's] 
B|81| B: [so .] 
A|82| A: [that's] [great] . 
B|83| B: [right] [that's] true . [or] even [have you ever] seen _where_ [they] they'll [take] [a] watermelon [and] [just] cut [the] top [out] [of] [it [and] then] hollow [that] [out] [and then] [put] [the] fruit [in the] watermelon [that is] [really] neat . 
A|84| A: [but] [my] husband does [and [uh] i think] [one of the] [uh] [my] [first] [of] all always salary [and the] second thing [is] [uh] [because] [we have] [children] [so] [it would be uh] health benefits [and] medical benefits [and [and] uh] [right now] [we have] [probably] some excellent benefits [right now] . 
B|85| B: [but uh] [if it] [uh] [gets] [down] between [two] [then] i'll i'll vote [for the] party [because _i] know_ [you know] [something] [about] [the other] [guy] 
A|86| A: [we] [don't] [we] [don't] [do] enough [. [i] know] [we] [don't] [so uh] although lately [i've] been [uh] [a] friend [of] mine [that] [i] spend [a lot of] [time] _with_ does recycle [quite] [a] bit [and] [it's] [it's] [it's uh] interesting [to] watch some [of the] things [that] she does [and then] she's [almost] [had] [an] impact [on] [me] [uh] [where] she [doesn't] say anything [to] [me when] she comes [to] [my] house [but i] can kind [of] tell [it] bothers her [so] [just] unconsciously [i've] [i've] stopped buying [a lot of] [uh uh] [paper] plates [and] [paper] cups [and [i] don't] [do] [that] anymore [. [i] don't] [know] why [i] [just] [don't i] [just] [just] from socializing _with_ her [so .]
