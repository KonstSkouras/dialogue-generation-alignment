B|47| B: _i don't know_ how much _and i_ had _her_ _for over_ two years _and she_ [was] very affectionate . _she_ [would] [you know] crawl _on_ me _and she_ [would] sit [like] _on_ [my] neck _or_ [my] shoulder while [i was] working [and] things [like] [that .] [yeah] much [more] _than_ [you] [would] [think] . 
A|48| A: [and] _they_ [would] [not] [have] [the] quality 
B|49| B: [and] _he's like_ glued _at_ [the] t v . 
A|50| A: [yeah .] 
B|51| B: [yeah .] 
A|52| A: local [you] [mean] ? 
B|53| B: _and uh_ [somebody] [is] _on the_ premises 
A|54| A: [yeah] [he's like] [i] thought _he_ [was] [the] owner _but it_ turns [out] [my] mom [said] [that] [he's] part owner [but] _he_ must own [the] biggest chunk [because] [that's all] [you] hear _about_ [is] _if [you_ know] _about_ neal bush [i think] [is] [his] name . 
B|55| B: [my] boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy [. and] _then_ [we] had [a] baby [and] [it's] [like] [all] _right_ _who_ _comes_ [first] [the] cat _or_ [the] baby . 
A|56| A: one [of] [them] _is [a_ lot] bigger [than] [the] other one [and she] pushes [the] other one away from [the] food . apparently [i don't know] [all the] details [but] _they_ [were] born around _christmas_ [because] one [of] [them] [is] named tinsel [and] [the] other one [is] named holly . 
B|57| B: [and you] ? 
A|58| A: [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [uh-huh .]

A|64| A: huh ? 
B|65| B: [oh] [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [and] they're [just] [really] close [here] [. and] [his] mother _has_ bad health _too_ [and] [so] [i] go [over] sometimes [in the] day when [he's] [at] work [and i] [um] help [with] [her] [and] bathe [her] [and] feed [her] . 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] absolutely [. and that] [i [i] don't _know] if_ [uh [i don't] _know] if_ everybody understands [all the] implications _on_ [that] [too .] even [if you] _you know [if_ you] [take] [uh] [a] [a] drug [that was] prescribed [for] [you] [but] [the] [the] prescription [has] run [out] [you] still had _some_ left [and you] happen [to] [take] _an_ extra penicillin [well] penicillin's [not] _on the_ list [but] [you know] 
A|68| A: [and] _they_ sell [i guess] _they_ sell everything [to] [some] waste company [that] [comes] [and] gets [it .] 
B|69| B: [that's] amazing [well] what's [the] difference [there] [do [you] know] ? 
A|70| A: [it's] [the] same _thing_ [that's] [on the] radio word [for] word . 
B|71| B: [but it] served [our] needs . [uh] later [on] [his] reports [the] reports [that] [he] studied showed [that] [uh] nissan [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in the] [in the] class [that we] [were] looking [for] [. and that] [and] i'd rather [have a] maxima [than] [a] cadillac [. i] [really] [would] . [it's] [not] necessarily prestige 
A|72| A: [and uh] evaluation [of] [an] individual . [course] [all of] [it] depends [on the] _type of_ job responsibility [you have] [. [i] think] [you have] [to] dress sort [of] accordingly . 
B|73| B: [but uh] mine [was a] [year] _old_ 
A|74| A: [um] [to] [don't] adam talking [to] [um] city 
B|75| B: [i _i think] it_ [has] [to be] [some] [kind of] common sense applied _there [._ and] [there] may [be] where [the] judiciary [is _a] little_ [more] learned [about] [that] [type of] [thing] [because] [they] _can_ [be] schooled [in] _that kind of_ [thing] 
A|76| A: [it's really] sad . 
B|77| B: [i] remember seeing [that .] 
A|78| A: [yeah] [and] [they] [they] [have] [like] [little] [little] boxes [that] [you] [can] put _your_ [old] bags [in] .

A|86| A: [yeah] [that's] [because] [it] [it] [can't] tolerate [a] freeze [this] early . [is] [that] [right] ? 
B|87| B: [right .] 
A|88| A: [yeah [.] [i] think it] made [about] three minutes [on] one [of] [the] national news stations [or something] [and] [and] we've [been] [in] [a] state [of] emergency [for over] [you know] [for] ten [or] eleven [days] . 
B|89| B: [you] cannot show [your] retriever [if] [it's you know] [a] hundred plus pounds . 
A|90| A: _oh ._ 
B|91| B: [so] [uh] 
A|92| A: _probably_ [. right] [i] [can] imagine [that .] 
B|93| B: [oh .] 
A|94| A: [and we] [just] [have] [this] [uh] [really] [good] time [there .] one [thing] [is] [they] [don't] [have] mosquitoes [and uh] sorry [to] say [and uh] [in] wisconsin [we] [do] [so] [that kind of] puts [a little] bit [of] [a] hamper [on] [your] [uh] [you know if] [if] you're [going] [to] go camping [who] wants [to] deal [with] bugs [and uh] 
B|95| B: [probably] [so] 
A|96| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [well the] jury [that] sentenced [him] sentenced [him] [to] death 
A|98| A: [what] [do you] [like] [to] watch [on] television ?
