B|39| B: [yeah right] [right] 
A|40| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: _yeah _._ i think_ _i think_ texas [is] texas [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat [more] conservative [and] still _have the_ death penalty [and _i] think_ [i know] california [had] _it for_ [a] _long_ time [and then] [they] [uh] took [it] off [the] books [they] repealed [it] 
A|42| A: [and then] _there's_ also [uh] [what] [we] [found] [uh] [in the] state [of] [uh] south dakota [the] black hills . 
B|43| B: [yeah] [and] spend [a] [day] _doing_ [that's] [really] neat _. i_ mean [it's not] [a lot] [because] you're [just] _doing a_ house _at_ [a] time [but] [you know] every _little bit_ helps . 
A|44| A: _all_ [right [.] well] [good] [to] hear [good] [to] hear . 
B|45| B: [uh] you're [very] fortunate . 
A|46| A: [at] least where [you] . 
B|47| B: those petroleum products [are] going [to] kill [us] . 
A|48| A: _oh_ [i just] love _cats_ [. i] [like] dogs they're okay [i] [had] [i] [had] [a] dog [when] [i] lived [at] _home_ 
B|49| B: [well] [when] [she] got [home] [who] took [care] [of her] ? 
A|50| A: _it was_ [a] joy [in] talking [with] [you] . 
B|51| B: [they] never go [to] [see] _them_ . 
A|52| A: ha-ha [well] [i] _was_ kind [of] hoping [with] [you know] [do] [you] _work_ [for] t [i] ? 
B|53| B: [there's] [there's] [a lot of] [you know] _last_ minute [uh] [things] [that] happen cause [a] person _not to_ _have_ [to] go through _the whole_ [thing] . 
A|54| A: [would be] [a] definite deterrent [and] [and uh] giving [the] [uh] police [uh] agencies [a] [little bit] [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] [when] [they] [when] [they] catch these [people] . 
B|55| B: _but uh_ sure [is] [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] [work] . 
A|56| A: _no_ regardless [of] [that] fact . [it's] [the best] car [in the] class [for] [the] cheapest amount [of] money . i'm interested [in] having [it for] [uh] [doing a] [little] autocross racing [uh] closed circuit racing 
B|57| B: [uh] _i think_ [well] something [on the] order _of a_ three series [it's] probably [different] . [once] [you] _get_ _up_ [in the] five series [and] higher [then] [all] [your] repair costs go _up_ significantly 
A|58| A: [and] [they] everybody _decided_ [to] come over [and] talk [to] [me] [right] now . [but uh] [it's] [yeah .] 
B|59| B: [we] started out [with] two [with] two outdoor [cats] [but] _our_ neighbor [decided] [he] didn't [like] [cats] [and] shot _one_ _of them_ . 
A|60| A: [and] [and i] _was_ trying [to get] [my] son [to] sing _that ._ [my] husband _was_ [just] having [a] fit [to] sound [like] [her] [don't] [have] him sing [that] song [but they] [they] [do] [a lot of] fun [things] [. i think] football [is] football [is] kind [of [a] a] sport _that [i_ think] [you] kind [of] [it's] hard [not to] [like it] . [because] [you know] [there's] [just] 
B|61| B: [yeah] [that's] true . 
A|62| A: [well] [i just] wanted [it] [because] again [i] [had] [i] guess traditionally always [had] [a] car [that] [had] [one] [and [i] thought] [it] [would be] [more] reliable . 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [i] float [so] [that i] [have] [no] benefits except higher pay [for] [doing] [that .] 
A|66| A: [there's] always [that] chance [i don't know] [but] [i] [would] [say] [that] [you know] [for] [that] many [people] [to] [all] [of them] agree [that] [you] did [it] [and] _it was_ premeditated [it] [would be] kind [of] hard [for] [you know] 
B|67| B: [but] [oh] [he's] been [a] wonderful cat . 
A|68| A: [i] can hear [the] accent now [i] hear [the] [i] hear [the] western pennsylvania [um .] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but] [you] probably pay [more] percentage wise [in] other taxes . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [it was] [not] gross [i] didn't [see] [it] [but] [um] got [them] . 
A|74| A: [is] [it] ? 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .]

A|82| A: [so] [it's] [a lot of] fun [. i] worked [up] there [last] summer [so] [i] guess [it was] kind [of] [like] [a] _vacation_ [the whole] summer [long] 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [well] [the course] [in] [our] particular state [uh] [we [have] the] prison overcrowding whatever [so] they're giving [the] early release [uh] 
B|85| B: [uh] cause i've been [at] places [which] offer [a lot of] support [and] others [that] [don't] offer any [and] [some] [that] [sometimes] [that's] coincided [with] [a] place [that] offers [more] [vacation] time though
