B|53| B: [there's] , [there's] [a lot [of] [,] you know ,] _last_ minute [, uh ,] [things] [that] happen cause [a] person _not to_ , _have_ [to] go through [the] _whole_ [thing] . 
A|54| A: [would be] [a] definite deterrent [and [,] and [, uh] ,] giving [the] [, uh ,] police [, uh ,] agencies [a] [little bit] [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they] [do] [when] [they [,] when] [they] catch these [people] . 
B|55| B: _but , uh ,_ sure [is] [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] [work] . 
A|56| A: _no_ , regardless [of] [that] fact . [it's] [the best] car [in the] class [for] [the] cheapest amount [of] money . i'm interested [in] having [it for] [, uh ,] [doing a] [little] autocross racing [, uh ,] closed circuit racing 
B|57| B: [uh [,] _i] think_ , [well ,] something [on the] order _of a_ three series [, it's] probably [different] . [once] [you] _get_ _up_ [in the] five series [and] higher , [then ,] [all] [your] repair costs go _up_ significantly 
A|58| A: [and] [they ,] everybody _decided_ [to] come over [and] talk [to] [me] [right] now . [but , uh [,] it's] [, yeah .] 
B|59| B: [we] started out [with] two , [with] two outdoor [cats] [but] _our_ neighbor [decided] [he] didn't [like] [cats] [and] shot _one_ _of them_ . 
A|60| A: [and [,] and i] _was_ trying [to get] [my] son [to] sing _that ._ [my] husband _was_ [just] having [a] fit [to] sound [like] [her] [don't] [have] him sing [that] song [but [,] [they] [,] they] [do] [a lot of] fun [things] [. i think] football [is] , football [is] kind [of [a] , a] sport _that [i_ think] [you] kind [of [,] it's] hard [not to] [like it] . [because] [you know] [there's] [just] , 
B|61| B: [yeah [,] that's] true . 
A|62| A: [well [,] i just] wanted [it] [because ,] again [, i] [had] [, i] guess traditionally always [had] [a] car [that] [had] [one] [and [i] thought] [it] [would be] [more] reliable . 
B|63| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [i] float [so] [that i] [have] [no] benefits except higher pay [for] [doing] [that .] 
A|66| A: [there's] always [that] chance [, [i] don't [know] [,] [but] [,] i] [would] [say] [that [,] you know ,] [for] [that] many [people] [to] [all] [of them] agree [that] [you] did [it] [and] _it was_ premeditated [, it] [would be] kind [of] hard [for] [, you know ,] 
B|67| B: [but] [oh ,] [he's] been [a] wonderful cat . 
A|68| A: [i] can hear [the] accent now [i] hear [the] [i] hear [the] western pennsylvania _, [um_ .] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [but] [you] probably pay [more] percentage wise [in] other taxes . 
A|72| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [it was] [not] gross [, i] didn't [see] [it] [but [,] [um] ,] got [them] . 
A|74| A: [is] [it] ? 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .]

B|79| B: [that's] correct . 
A|80| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: [and] [that] [was] [the] most boring place [on] earth . 
A|82| A: [so] [it's] [a lot of] fun [. i] worked [up] there [last] summer , [so] [i] guess [it was] kind [of] [like] [a] _vacation_ [the] , [whole] summer [long] 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [well [,] the] , [course] [in] [our] particular state [, uh [,] [we] [have] the] prison overcrowding , whatever , [so] they're giving [the] early release [, uh ,] 
B|85| B: [uh ,] cause i've been [at] places [which] offer [a lot of] support [and] others [that] [don't] offer any [and] [some] [that [,] sometimes] [that's] coincided [with] [a] place [that] offers [more] [vacation] time though ,
