B|5| B: _yeah and_ [there] will _be _a_ lot of_ rebellion [in] [that] _and when_ _you_ _get_ [people] _who_ _have no_ desire _to be_ [there] _in the_ _first_ [place] _i don't _think_ that_ _they're_ _going _to_ be_ serving anybody . 
A|6| A: _yeah ._ [yeah] _we_ [uh] _we've_ _got_ _you know_ _i'll_ store _all_ _our_ christmas _stuff_ [and] [whatever] else junk _up_ _there ._

B|17| B: [yeah .] _i've_ _i've_ heard _some_ _i mean_ _i've_ heard statistics [and] _things_ _that that_ compare [a] public _education_ [to] [a] private _education _._ i mean_ within _like_ within [the same] [uh] income _groups_ . 
A|18| A: [yeah .] 
B|19| B: [well] _they_ _were_ _i was_ watching _some_ show [the] _other_ day _and they_ _were_ talking [about] [uh] mass murderers 
A|20| A: [well] you're [really] _not_ _too_ bad . [yeah .] 
B|21| B: [but] . 
A|22| A: _right_ _right ._ 
B|23| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _but uh_ nevertheless _i think_ [people] _are_ _just_ _getting_ fed _up and_ saying _you know_ [you] _can't_ arrest _all_ [of] us 
B|25| B: [yeah _.] that's_ _true_ _. _and_ they_ won't raise [our] taxes .

A|28| A: _um_ . 
B|29| B: [yeah .] _i'm_ _i'm_ ambivalent [about] [it] _because_ [um] [uh] [well] _it is_ [very] frightening [and] scary _. _i_ have no_ perspective [on] _how_ [it] relates [to] _other_ diseases [and _uh] i mean_ whether 
A|30| A: [yeah] [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [very] _interesting ._ 
A|32| A: [well] [it's] [to] protect [the] [the] banks _from_ guys [that] say [yeah] _i want _to_ build_ _my_ _own_ house [and] _go_ _out_ [a] _build_ [a] spec _home_ 
B|33| B: _some _of_ our_ neighbors _were_ _doing_ [it] [and] _so [you_ know] _when i_ _found_ [out] _some_ places [to] take [it] _and um_ _like_ [um] _they_ _also_ take _some_ _things_ at [the] _flower mound_ dump behind [the] fire station [there] _and i know that_ _they're_ _going to_ use [you know] [the] _money_ _for_ [that] [to build] _some_ [kind of] multipurpose field [and that] type [of] [thing] . _put_ lights [and] [stuff] 
A|34| A: [okay] bye-bye . 
B|35| B: _uh _we_ have a_ big old farmhouse [that] [we've] [you know] remodeled . 
A|36| A: [oh] [how] sweet . 
B|37| B: [well] anytime _they_ send _me_ [a] return envelope [i] _put_ [all] [that] [stuff] _back_ _in the_ envelope plus [the] _other_ [stuff] _that i_ [you know] _happen_ [to] gather _up ._ 
A|38| A: [and [when] i] went [to] _school_ [that] _just_ wasn't [put] _up with_ . 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [uh] [we've] _got_ plenty [in] _fact_ [we've] _got_ far _too_ _many_ . you're [in] _uh what_ [flower mound] ? 
B|41| B: [and _uh] _i think_ that_ [we're] _paying_ [too] [much] _because_ _i don't_ _have_ any [children] . 
A|42| A: [you know] stupid guys [and _uh] it_ _turned_ [out] [that] [the] [you know] policeman survived _to the_ point [that] _he was_ able _to [you_ know] identify [the] guy . 
B|43| B: [then] [i think] [it] makes [a] big difference . 
A|44| A: [and] [it is] [too] far south [for] [me] 
B|45| B: _you know _._ that's_ [just] _that's_ [my] views _you know ._ 
A|46| A: [yes .] [that _that] was_ [true] [for] mine [too] _. uh_ [although] [i] [i'm] _sure_ [to] [some] extent [that] [money] [is] _part _of_ the_ problem [in the] disparity [but] [i don't think] [i] honestly [don't think] [that's] [the] biggest _part _of_ _it_ _._ _you know_ [i_ think that] [uh i mean] [i know _that] in_ [my] town [you know] most _of the_ most _of the_ _parents_ [they're] valued [education .] 
B|47| B: _because_ she wanted [you know] she [just] seemed [to] _enjoy_ [it] [so] [much] [and] _now_ [my] [my] four [year] old four _and a_ half [year] old daughter [is] [is] trying [to] imitate her [older] sister [and] wanting [to] play [and] she [actually] does [some] [very] _nice_ chording [just] _naturally_ . she [just] 
A|48| A: _i'll_ _have to_ admit [i don't] [i] _do_ [my] _own_ yard [. _i] i_ [really] [don't] [enjoy] [doing] [that [.] i] [enjoy] having [a] [nice] looking yard 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [um] . [uh-huh _.] you know_ [now] [i] wonder _what you_ [think] [about] _this_ [and uh] unfortunately [we] [we] [don't] [get] _to _do_ it_ _but _uh_ it_ _used _to_ be a_ long _time_ ago [i] guess [in] biblical times [when] [they] _had_ _punishment_ _if_ somebody _did_ _something_ [for] example [to] _your_ _family_ [then] [you] _had_ [the] [right] [to] administer [the] _punishment_ _. so_ _if_ somebody killed somebody [in] _your_ _family_ [then] [you] _had_ [the] [right] [to] [uh] _if_ [that] person [was] caught [and] [found] _guilty_ [you] _had_ [the] [right] [to] [uh] execute [that] person [. [and] i know that] [uh] _if_ somebody _had_ done _something_ [to] [my] _family_ _i would_ _feel [that_ i] _had_ [the] [right] _to to get_ revenge [on] _them_ [and uh] [but] _i i don't think_ [that's] done [much] anywhere [that's] [kind of] drastic _punishment_ . 
B|51| B: [but uh] _they want_ [too] [much] [money] . 
A|52| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|53| B: [oh] _no_ . 
A|54| A: [well] _what_ [about] random testing _though_ . 
B|55| B: _and then_ _i have_ [my] freedom [. i] [can] _work_ seven days _in a_ _row_ [and] take _a week_ off _or_ [whatever] [i want [to] do] . 
A|56| A: [well] [we have a] funny commercial _around_ _here_ . [it] says _something_ [like] _if_ [people] [were] [to] give _five_ hours [a week] [or] _five_ _percent_ [of] _their_ salary _we could_ _they could_ solve _all the_ world's problems _or something_ _. so i_ guess _if_ [we] [all] give _five_ hours [a week] [or] _five_ _percent_ [of our] salary _we could_ [uh] 
B|57| B: [yeah .] [i'm] _down_ [here] at [t] [i] . 
A|58| A: [well] [there] [is] [so] _many_ chances [for] appeal [that] [it] 
B|59| B: _they don't_ warp . 
A|60| A: [and] 
B|61| B: [i] [can't] believe _they have_ [the] nerve [to do] [that .] 
A|62| A: [i] _like [that_ .] 
B|63| B: [okay] [. [uh] what] type [of] [uh] utilizations _do you_ make [of it] ? word processing _obviously_ . 
A|64| A: [but] 
B|65| B: [oh] [okay] . [do] [do] [they] play [like] [uh] [like] does [the] eight [year] old play baseball ? 
A|66| A: [the] economy _around_ [here] [is] _real_ poor 
B|67| B: [right .] 
A|68| A: [have] [you] ? 
B|69| B: [and] [did] [it] again [and uh] 
A|70| A: [yeah] [um] . 
B|71| B: _what's_ [the] topic ? 
A|72| A: [and] _course_ [that's] [kind of] [like] [a] cancer [in] [an] apartment complex _. you_ start letting [that] [happen] [and they] _go_ [down] [and then] before [you know] [it] _you have_ drugs [and [a] lot of] [other] [things] [so] [uh] [i'm] _sure_ [that] aggravates [it] [also] . 
B|73| B: [and [i] i don't think] [i'll] [do it] again 
A|74| A: [um] [but] 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [yeah .] 
A|78| A: [and i] _feel_ [like] _i would_ never [put] _them_ [in a] _home_ _. but_ [i] wonder [how] [much] [you know] _if_ [one] [of] us [is] [going to] _have to_ quit [work] someday [or] retire early _or something_ . 
B|79| B: [and uh] she [was] she [did] [not] [want] any [part of] swimming [but] she liked [to to get] [in the] pool [on] [the] _first_ step . she'd [just] [get] [on] [the] _first_ step [and] lay [down] [. you know] [in the] summertime [when] [it's] [really] [really] [hot] . 
A|80| A: [yeah .] [yeah] _are you_ [do _you] _like_ the_ heat [in the] summer [then] [when] [it] gets [up] [in the] nineties [and] hundreds . 
B|81| B: [i] haven't _bought it_ [now] [for] [about] eight _years [._ but] [when i] [used [to] get] [it] _it was_ [about] [five] hundred pages [about] three hundred _of them_ advertising . 
A|82| A: [we] _had_ [uh we] _had_ organizations _like _that_ in_ college [you know .] [we] _had a_ community service group [in] college [that] _had_ [all] sorts [of] _different_ [groups] [and] [some] [did] _like that_ [some] [did] elderly visits 
B|83| B: [yeah yeah] [it's] [getting] [real] close [to] 
A|84| A: [well] _good_ . 
B|85| B: chili . 
A|86| A: sounds _like _you_ [have_ _a] little_ [one] _just like_ [i] [do] 
B|87| B: [well [i] think [that] in] [some] cases [it is] warranted . 
A|88| A: [no] 
B|89| B: [it's] [like] [get] [a] painter [you know] [or something] [a] artist [. it's] [like] [well] [you] _how do you_ [really] rate [you know] michelangelo [you know] [how] [would] [you] tell [if] [he was] [you know] [really] [good] [or] so-so [or] [whatever] 
A|90| A: [well] [um] [i _was] a_ technical writer [for] _many_ [years] [um] 
B|91| B: [right .] 
A|92| A: [now] [how do you] [mean] [that] ? [i know] [it] 
B|93| B: [you know i] [it's] [going] [just] _for the_ sake _of getting_ together [i think] _for the_ [family] [. and] 
A|94| A: _so [._ uh] [do] 
B|95| B: [uh it] use [to be] use [to be a] [uh] [uh] [have [a] lot of] heavy industry 
A|96| A: [okay] 
B|97| B: [yeah] [uh] [it's] [yeah] _there you_ [you know] usually _there's_ [uh _i] [have_ a] farm [a] hundred miles east [of] [here] [in] east texas _and [you_ know] [all] _these_ huge trees [just [like] the] eastern hard wood belt [all the] way [up] [to] maine [you know] [it's] [that] [same] trees pines [and and] hard woods [you know] hickories [and] oaks [and] [stuff] 
A|98| A: [yeah] [what's] amazing [is] [some [of] them] [have] _been_ [on] _death_ [row] _for a_ number [of] [years .] 
B|99| B: [now] [uh] [well [i] i] still _go back_ [to] ... 
A|100| A: [but] [these] [people] [obviously] weren't . 
B|101| B: [i] hate [to] [put] [it] quite [that] way . 
A|102| A: great . 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|105| B: [sure] [did] . 
A|106| A: [oh] [out] [of] _as_ opposed _to the_ insurance [paying] [the] bills 
B|107| B: [and] [so] [and] [in the] book [you know] _even_ [he] wrote [this] book _back_ [in the] seventies [and] _even_ [and] _even_ [then] [he] [he] [had a] [very] [good] case _for the_ [fact] [they] _probably_ [just] [got] lost [and they] ditched [in the] water [. [and] uh] _because_ [he] [he] mentions [he] [he] _goes_ through [and] brings [out] points [from] [the] navy's findings [and] [so] forth [. [and] uh] [it's] _probably_ [you know] [real] close [to] [what [you] know] everyone [is] [thinking] [now] _that they_ [just] [got] [turned] [around] [and] [could] [not] find [their] way _back_ . 
A|108| A: [who] [do you] [think] ? [the] dallas cowboys . 
B|109| B: [well] [so] [so [.] so] [your] wife does she [work] [right] [now] ? 
A|110| A: _yeah _well_ i'm_ planning [a] [and] [naturally] [this] [is] appropriate [because] [i'm] planning dinner [for] [people] tomorrow night [and then] [the] next night . 
B|111| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [and i] understand [that] [the] jails _are_ full _of people_ [you know] [uh [and] [that] [they] _have] [to_ do] [something] . 
B|113| B: [and [and] i] asked [them] [you know] [these] [are] [the] ages [of the] kids [what] [do] [i] [get] [. [and] they] [all] said golden retriever [and i] said [okay] [put] [it] under twenty pounds [. and] [the] _only_ [thing] [that [they] could] _come_ [up with] [was a] bichon frize which [is] [a] 
A|114| A: [i've] seen [that .] [yeah .] 
B|115| B: [yeah _.] that's_ [true] . 
A|116| A: [no] huh-uh [. [uh] i think] [they're] [interesting .] 
B|117| B: [well i'm] [not] talking [about] any loss [. [i] was] talking [about] _only_ losses [that] [are] judged [for a] punitive damage which [is] another category [of the] juries [are] awarding damages [these] days based [on] [the] person's actual injuries [and] _what they_ [are] due [. [and] then] [they] [are] awarding [a] _second_ amount [as] [punishment] [to the] company which [is] [a] usually [a lot] less [. but] [it's] [an] [an] amount [they're] [designed to] sting [them] [a little] [for] [their] negligence . [for] gross wanton negligence [in a] claim . 
A|118| A: [um] . [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] [right] lots [of] [their] picture [and] life story [and] _everything_ . 
B|119| B: [but] _it would_ still _probably_ [be] cheaper [with] [the] company helping [our] [if] everybody [you know] pulled [their] [own] weight [in] [it .] 
A|120| A: [i'll] let [you] [go] [first] . 
B|121| B: [yeah .] definitely [i think that] _there's_ _probably_ [a lot of] waste [in] defense [and] [in] government funded research [in the] [first] [place] . 
A|122| A: [yeah [and] you] [just] sit [down] [and] [all the] girls [were] [all] dressed [up] [you know i] [just] [was] [there [you] know] [like] [i'm] loaded [i'm] [here] [you know] [and [uh] [it] _was] just_ [kind of] funny [because] [you know] [but] [we] [got] [to] sit by [first] base [if] [they] [did] hit [a] ball _i would_ [have] _been_ afraid [it would] [have] knocked [my] face [in] [you know .] 
B|123| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|124| A: seems [like] [i] [just] [bought [it] .] 
B|125| B: [yeah .] 
A|126| A: [yeah] [they're] [not] worth [a] [year] . [or] [some] [people] [just] [just] [can't] [even] afford [it] [you know] [whatever] [. i mean] [the] peace corps doesn't pay [very] [well] [. you know] ? 
B|127| B: [it] takes [uh it] takes almost six months [to get] [uh] handgun permit [in] [this] state . 
A|128| A: [uh] 
B|129| B: heavy science . [are [you] like] [in the] particle particle research [or] anything [like that] [or] [is] [it] more [um] applied physics ? 
A|130| A: [but] [the] _school_ system's afraid [of getting] sued [and um] [all] sorts [of] lawsuits [i'm] [sure] [because] _of things like [that_ .] 
B|131| B: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
A|132| A: [i] [just] _i go_ hysterical [when] [they don't] [come] _home_ . 
B|133| B: [yeah yeah .] 
A|134| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|135| B: [so] [i'm] either [going [to] be] [i'm] either [going to] starve [to] [death] [or] [i'm] [going [to] get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and] eat [as] healthily [as] [i] possibly [can] [you know .] 
A|136| A: [and then] 
B|137| B: hopefully [it's] [not] [my] wife . 
A|138| A: [uh-huh [.] [so] you] [what] you're saying [is] [this] [if] [there] [is] [the] [second] offense [then] [you] execute [them] . 
B|139| B: [right] [would] [you] use [that] [for] city driving [and] racing ? 
A|140| A: [um] [i have no] idea . 
B|141| B: [yeah [.] so [i] think] [it would] [be a] [good] [thing] [though] [to] encourage [other] [people] [who] aren't [even] aware [that they] [can do] such [a] [thing] . [to get] [out] [there] [and] [do] [so .] 
A|142| A: [probably] . [oh] . 
B|143| B: rome _new_ york [yeah .] 
A|144| A: [not] [for the] price ? 
B|145| B: [well] [uh] [uh] [about [the] same] [i] dress [for] [school] [. i] [uh i] am [a] graduate student [so [i] don't] [have to] worry [too] [much] [about] [uh what] [i] wear [too] [much] [of the] [time] . which [is] [nice] . 
A|146| A: [yeah .] 
B|147| B: [yeah .] 
A|148| A: [that's] [not] [too] bad [. that's] north . 
B|149| B: [how do] [we] usually ? 
A|150| A: [okay] 
B|151| B: [the] company [and [uh] you know] [what] [kind [of] people] [work] [there] [what] [uh] 
A|152| A: i'd i'd love [to] [go back] _there ._ [there's] [just] [not] [time] [there's] [not] enough [time] [to] [go] _see_ _everything_ [and then] [to] afford _to see_ _everything_ . 
B|153| B: [yeah well] [of] [course] [in the] [uh i think] [you] [probably] noticed [in the] discount stores [and] places [in the] hair sprays [we're] [not] seeing [as] [many] aerosol cans [down] [here] nearly [everything] [is] [in the] pump squirt 
A|154| A: every [time] [he] turns [around] [i'm] giving him [some] [new] rule _where_ you're supposed [to] squish [up] [the] [you know] [like] collapse [the] plastic jugs . instead [of] taking [them] [up] [there] solid . 
B|155| B: [i would] hope [we could] [do] [that] [and then] [go] [from] [there .] 
A|156| A: [well [i] don't] [know] [uh] we'll _see_ [how] [that] [goes] . 
B|157| B: [because] [i] since [i] came [from] [my] father has [uh] [five] sisters [and] two brothers [and] [my] mother has four brothers [and] two sisters [. so i] both [of] [my] [parents] [had] big families _and we_ always [we] always [got] together [just] always . [now] [it's] [different] [because] [i] live [here] [and i] [you know] [when [i] go] [home] [i] try [to see] [the] families [as] [much] [of the] [family] [as] [i] [can] [but] [it's] [real] [different] . 
A|158| A: [oh] [really] . 
B|159| B: [yeah] [i've] [been] lucky [in] [that] respect [that [i] don't] [uh] [don't] travel [too] [much] . 
A|160| A: [uh] [but] 
B|161| B: [no] [that's] [right .] 
A|162| A: [and we] [only] [have] [one] . [we] tore [all the] rest [of them] [up .] 
B|163| B: [and [you] know] [a lot [of] things like [that] that] [really] [are] hard [to] plan [for] [. [and] uh] 
A|164| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|165| B: [well] [especially] [with] [something] [where] [you [have] [to] [you] [have] to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [. [you] [have] to] find whether [they're] [guilty] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like] [do you] [really] [feel that] [sure] [about] 
A|166| A: [yeah .] 
B|167| B: [and i] totaled [them] [all] [up and] basically [uh we] [were] [going [to] be] [paying] seventy [or] eighty [percent] tax . 
A|168| A: [they] paid fifty-eight [for] [it .] 
B|169| B: [yeah .]
