B|59| B: i've [been] [to] telluride [which is] _on the_ west side [and , uh ,] copper , 
A|60| A: [right] _, but_ [i] suppose [it was] still _in the_ instinct _of them_ [to] [to] _back_ [up and] [get] ready . 
B|61| B: [yeah _, [i] [know_ ,] and that's [,] that's] [what] happened [to] [my] brother . [he] came [to] school [up here] [, [and] then] [when] [he] went down [there] [, he was] [just] [so] [bad] [off] [, you know] [from] [not] being able [to] stay [up here] [that] his life [just] went down [the] drain . 
A|62| A: [i know] [it [,] i know] [it .] 
B|63| B: [uh ,] [work] [, uh [,] i'm a] contract programmer . 
A|64| A: [yeah .] 
B|65| B: yep . 
A|66| A: _um_ . 
B|67| B: [uh] . 
A|68| A: [especially] [when] [you] [have] [a lot of] problems _with the_ children teeth [, _and ,] _and_ you_ [have] [to] [really] [get] [them] [when] [they] are young [, in] order _to have , uh ,_ [not] [, uh [,] a] decent smile [when] [they] are fifteen , sixteen years old . 
B|69| B: [but] _, then_ [, what do] [i know [,] i don't] [have] [any] kids . [no] , none [at] [all] 
A|70| A: [oh ,] [my] . 
B|71| B: [right [.] [yeah] [,] i'm] [not] [into] watching sports .

A|72| A: [uh-huh .] [well] [you] kind [of] [know] [what] [it's] [like] [, then] [. yeah .] 
B|73| B: [and , uh ,] [she] , [she] [got] pregnant [and then] [we] decided [she] [would] stay [home] [with the] kids [. [we] would] [make] [that] sacrifice . [it] [is] [a] financial sacrifice [to] [make] [because] [we] [go] [from] two incomes down [to] [one] . 
A|74| A: [well] both [of] mine are [boys] . [they're] eight [and] eleven 
B|75| B: [so [,] [i] [,] i] [would have] [really] [, i] haven't [really] priced [, you know [,] [in] the] market _, so_ [i ,] 
A|76| A: okay [, so] [this] town hall [that] [you] meet [in] , [is] [that] [like] [a _,] um ,_ 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [a] t s ? 
B|79| B: [um] 
A|80| A: [in] santa barbara . 
B|81| B: [it] [is] [just] [a] real pain [, or] _, you know , if_ [i'm] driving along [and] [there's] [somebody] [next] [to] [me] [and , uh ,] [somebody] [that [i] know] [and you] try [to] talk [to them] [it's] real difficult [to] drive , reach [over] [, and] try [to] roll down [the] window . 
A|82| A: [that] [is] [when] [she] [did] [, i think] . 
B|83| B: [yeah] 
A|84| A: [yeah .] 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [but] [, um ,] [at] least [they] [all] seem [to have , uh [,] you know ,] [people] [that] monitor [their] [, uh ,] medication intake [and] [dining] facilities [, you know ,] [go to the] [dining] room [and , and] [eat] some [good] meals . 
A|88| A: [would] be , [would] , might be [really] useful . [uh [,] and] [if [it's] [,] you know [,] uh ,] [just] [people] helping [people] [i think] makes , makes [the] community [so] [much] happier . 
B|89| B: [in] [that] case , maybe [, you know] . 
A|90| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: until [you] pull [the] pin [, yeah .] 
A|92| A: [well [,] i'm ,] are [you] [there] ?

A|98| A: except [i think] [the] [cowboys] are [on the] upswing [i don't] [know] [about the] vikings 
B|99| B: [yeah , that's] true . 
A|100| A: [no] . 
B|101| B: [yeah [,] it] [is] . [it] [really] [is] . 
A|102| A: [yeah _,] we_ _, we_ [did] [, for a] [time .] 
B|103| B: rome , [new] york [, it's] [up] state [it] [it's [,] uh ,] near syracuse 
A|104| A: [right .] 
B|105| B: [yeah .] 
A|106| A: [yeah [,] you know [, if] you get a] sweet strawberry [they're] [much] better [, but] [if you get a] sour strawberry , 
B|107| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [yeah , yeah [, i] think] [so] 
A|110| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [and , uh [,] we] [just] thought [it was] absolute heaven . 
A|112| A: [and] [we] [have] [to] bring [the] [paper] [bags] [back] every [time .] [because they] won't take [them] . 
B|113| B: [uh ,] some things [they do] [, one] [of them] [is] [they're] using corn [in] fuel .
