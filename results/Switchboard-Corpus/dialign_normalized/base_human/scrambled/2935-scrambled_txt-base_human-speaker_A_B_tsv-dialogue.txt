B|47| B: _um_ . wow . 
A|48| A: exactly . [uh] _i'm not sure_ [about] pennsylvania whether [we] [have it] [or] [not] . [for] [some] reason [i was] thinking [that] [we] do [but] [it's] [you know] [it's] [not] [very] often [. _i] think maybe_ [last year] [was] [the] first time [in like] eighteen years [or] something [like [that] that] anyone anyone from pennsylvania _had_ [gotten] [it] . 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [oh] [it's] [very] difficult [i] [know .] 
A|52| A:  . 
B|53| B: [and uh] [i was] [up] [there] [last] weekend [and] [there] [are] trees [that that] still [have] [their] leaves [on and] _they're_ green [but] _they're_ dead [you know] [the the] freeze [just] got [them] . [they] [they] weren't ready [for] [it] [at] _all_ apparently [and] [and] [we] haven't [had] [a] typical fall [at] _all_ . [not] [much] color [you know] changes [have] occurred [at] _all_ . [really] weird [this] [year] . [i'm not sure] [what] [that] [what] [that] means . 
A|54| A: [i mean] [you] [can] [just] sit [you know] those little booklets [that] [come] along [with] [it] 
B|55| B: [and then] [they] [take] these [things] [that] will rust [and] [they] throw [them] [in the] ocean which [is going] [to] speedup [the] process even _more_ . 
A|56| A: okay . [so] _we're_ [in] garland . 
B|57| B: [uh] no [not] _actually_ 
A|58| A: [but] [not] [all] country [. [i] don't] [like that] when [they] [start] 
B|59| B: [uh] _i guess_ [i] [uh] [i] [like] _to play_ golf . 
A|60| A: did [you] ? 
B|61| B: [well] _she_ [was] almost ridiculous . [like] she'd eat ice cream [and] cookies . she'd 
A|62| A: _yeah ._ 
B|63| B: [yeah .] 
A|64| A: [but] he likes [to] [have] [a] spot [to] keep [all] [of] his his piddling [things] . 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: that's [yeah] 
B|67| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [i think maybe] [a year] would be [the] longest . 
A|70| A: [um] [the] south hills [area] beaver county [well] originally beaver county . 
B|71| B: [it was] bred [out of] several different retrievers [and] [they] bred [it] [for] companionship [and uh] [uh] disposition [and] [and] ability [to] hunt . [it was] [kept] [only] by kings . 
A|72| A: [and] [it's] [really] [a a] blast . [my] wife hates [it] [but] that's [the] [way] life [is] [i guess] . 
B|73| B: [so] travel [and] leisure [food] [and] wine [and] [i think] [they] [have] [some] others [uh] certainly half [the] pages [and] [maybe] _more_ [are] pure ads plus [they] [have the] advertising supplement sections [that] [are] supposed [to] look [like] articles [but] [are] paid [for] [and] [they] [don't] care [if] [they] make any money [on the] magazine subscription _they're_ making everything [on] ads . 
A|74| A: [well] [it's] [really] fun . [um] one [of] [my] neighbors moved [here] from memphis [and] [a lot of] [them] [played] [it] [and] [she] started [a] group [going] [in the] neighborhood [and] [my] _kids_ wanted [to] _learn_ how [to play] [it] [and] [it's] [more] fun [with] four [people] . 
B|75| B: because [i think] [what] [we're] [going] [to] go [to] [is] [much] [more] commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures [in the] market . [as] [a] matter [of] fact [my] future [is] banked [on] [that] [uh] professionally because [i] [believe [that] that] [there] [are] [uh] pressing needs [in the] marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities [for] [uh] learning [a lot of] [things] [that] [kids] [can] [learn] watching sesame street [and] [in] child care . 
A|76| A: right . right . [um [i] think] [i] [i've] singled [out] [my] grandchildren [and] [but] [actually] [they're] [they're] [pretty] [good] along those lines [as] compared [to] [what] [i] [have] seen from other people's [children] [and] grandchildren mine aren't [really] [that] [bad]
