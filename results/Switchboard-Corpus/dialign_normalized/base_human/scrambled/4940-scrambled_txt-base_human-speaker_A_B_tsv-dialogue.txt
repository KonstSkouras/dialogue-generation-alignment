A|28| A: long way [uh] 
B|29| B: _well_ _that's_ true _and_ _lot of_ times though [it] [is] [it] costs [so] _much_ _to _get_ something_ fixed [that] [you] almost are _just_ _as_ _well_ off buying another _one_ _you know_ if _it's_

A|32| A: [yeah .] 
B|33| B: [uh-huh] _that's_ [right] [they] pull [the] strings . 
A|34| A: [yeah] [that] [that] _would_ [all] start _at_ _at_ [um] [that] _would_ [all] start _at_ _at_ eight o'clock here [that] wouldn't start _at_ seven _. _we_ have_ [um] _at_ seven o'clock [we] [just] [have] [um] [the] they'll _play_ _you know they_ [have] _old_ reruns [of] cheers _or_ [something] [from] seven [to] seven thirty _and then_ _something else_ [from] seven thirty [to] eight 
B|35| B: [oh] which state _is that_ ? 
A|36| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [what] [kind of] crimes [would] [you] use [it] [for] ? 
A|38| A: [that's] _life_ [that's] [how] _life_ goes . 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [and um] [uh] [it's] _not_ [a big] deal [really] _i mean_ _they're they're_ happier [when] we're around _but_ _you know they_ _they're_ _pretty_ [much] _okay_ by themselves [um] [and] _i don't_ [you know] [we] couldn't [do] [that] [with] [a] dog . 
B|41| B: [we] [don't] regret paying _taxes_ [. we] [do] think [that] [uh] sometimes [uh [we] have] [a] reverse _of a_ regressive tax [a] progressive tax . 
A|42| A: _uh well_ [no] [i] can't [really] complain . [i'm] [a] student [um] [and] _i i_ work [as] [a] co-op _at_ [uh] georgia tech research institute . _and uh_ [i'm] going [to get] [back] _most_ [of] _what i_ earned _i mean_ _most_ [of] _what i_ pay [in] [taxes] _and _uh_ _and_ uh_ [one] [of] _my_ [parents] [is] _still_ claiming _me_ . 
B|43| B: [so] [we] will [play] either _out_ there [or] [at] firewheel . [that] [is] usually where [we] [play] [but] [i] [have] played [you know] different courses [in] _in the_ dallas area . 
A|44| A: [right .] 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] [um] [i] [see] . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [we] [we] usually collect [a] [you know] collect [a] quite [a] bit [and then] [we] _take_ them _take_ them [in] . 
A|48| A: [well] _there's_ [a] [lot of] fat [in] meat . 
B|49| B: [oh] wow . 
A|50| A: [well] [yeah .] [it's] [really] nice [too] [because] [i] can't [see] _my_ nearest neighbor . _he's_ _on _the_ other_ side [of a] hill . 
B|51| B: [they] got [that] [uh] [what] _is that_ safer soap [uh] b t spray this year . 
A|52| A: [oh .] 
B|53| B: [yeah _.] i_ i've always liked [that .] [the] [you know] [i] [we] [don't] [have] [much] yard [but] [i] built [a] small deck _in the_ [back] . 
A|54| A: [so] _there's_ [the] potential [that] perhaps [you know] [the] u s budget _might_ want [to] [take] [a] _look_ [at] [it's] [uh] federal employees [or] [and] [take] [a] _look_ [at] saying [well] let's freeze wages _. i mean_ everybody's doing [it] [so] [it] isn't [like] [uh] private business has had [to] [do] [it] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [you] [don't] sound [like] you're [in the] north . [you] sound [like] you're [in the] south somewhere . 
B|57| B: [oh] [i] [do] [too] 
A|58| A: [uh] 
B|59| B: [uh well] [i don't] actually [live] [in the] city [but] i'd probably say [that's] roughly [right [.] i mean] crimes against property seem [to] outnumber crimes against [life] [but] [i i] think [with] [the] current war [on] drugs [and] [all] this [kind of] stuff i'd say probably [the] police department [would] claim [the] number [one] crimes crimes are probably solicitation [of] prostitution [uh and] sale [of] drugs . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh] major . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
A|62| A: [sure] . let somebody [get something] [out] [of] [it] . 
B|63| B: [but] [there's] probably [something else] [that] [might] _make_ [you] . [because] [you] could [know] [about] [you] could [know] [about] [the] crime [but] [not] necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury [you know] [not] [be] accepted [for] [the] jury . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [well] [a] little bit [for] [the] price 
A|66| A: [right] [yeah] [i'm] [a] graduate student [and] let's face [it] [i don't] [make] any money [so] 
B|67| B: [uh] [it] [there's] some trees [like] [the] oaks [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] [pretty] hardy . [there's] nothing bothers them . their leaves are [still] green [and] some [of] [the other] oaks . there are [a] few oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . [um] [what i] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [that] [the] leaves are [just] dead [the] dogwoods [still] [look] [still] [look] [you know they] got [uh] bit [on the] ends [of] [the] leaves [a] little bit [but] [they] [still] [look] [pretty] good . 
A|68| A: [right .] [and then] [do] [it] [all] [over] again [. uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [how] many stories ? _just one_ ? 
A|70| A: [uh-huh] [yeah .] 
B|71| B: [i] [know] [when] [my] friend's mother-in-law first went [in] [i mean] very antisocial . maybe [it] [takes] [a] while [for] them [to] say [okay] [well] i'll [be] [with] [other] [people] [but] 
A|72| A: [it's] [just one] story . [yeah .] [it's a] fox [and] jacobs _home_ . 
B|73| B: [and then] suddenly he sees [that] [he's] getting [old] [and] he wants [to be] best friends 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: [oh] except [the] kid huh [that's] 
B|77| B: [and uh] [you know] [that] didn't bother [me] [uh] [too] [much] [and] [so i guess] [it] depends [um] if there are some statistics [that] show [that] [uh] [that] [people] [uh] commit crimes [on the] spur [of] [the] moment . 
A|78| A: [sure] . [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [really] . 
A|80| A: [is that] [in] term 
B|81| B: [most] [people] are are retired [or] [or] [or] [you know] [they're they're] [in] their forties [or] [or] whatever [. so] [and] [i'm] [in] [my] twenties [so i] [i'm] [i'm] [out] more than [they] are [but] [they're] [at] [home] [at] night
