A|44| A: [right .] 
B|45| B: [uh-huh .] [um [,] i] [see] . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [we] [, we] usually collect [a [,] you know ,] collect [a] quite [a] bit [and then] [we] _take_ them , _take_ them [in] . 
A|48| A: [well _,] there's_ [a] [lot of] fat [in] meat . 
B|49| B: [oh ,] wow . 
A|50| A: [well [,] [yeah] .] [it's] [really] nice [too] [because] [i] can't [see] _my_ nearest neighbor . _he's_ _on _the_ other_ side [of a] hill . 
B|51| B: [they] got [that [,] uh [,] what] _is that_ safer soap [, uh ,] b t spray this , year . 
A|52| A: [oh .] 
B|53| B: [yeah _.] i_ , i've always liked [that .] [the [,] you know [,] i] [, we] [don't] [have] [much] yard [but] [i] built [a] small deck _in the_ [back] . 
A|54| A: [so] _there's_ [the] potential [that] perhaps [, you know _,] the_ u s budget _might_ want [to] [take] [a] _look_ [at] [it's [,] uh ,] federal employees _or [,_ and] [take] [a] _look_ [at] saying _, well ,_ let's freeze wages _. i mean_ everybody's doing [it] [so] [it] isn't [like] [, uh ,] private business has had [to] [do] [it] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [you] [don't] sound [like] you're [in the] north . [you] sound [like] you're [in the] south somewhere . 
B|57| B: [oh [,] i] [do] [too] 
A|58| A: [uh ,] 
B|59| B: [uh , well _,] i don't_ actually [live] [in the] city , [but] i'd probably say [that's] roughly [right [.] i mean] crimes against property seem [to] outnumber crimes against [life ,] [but] [i] [, i] think [with] [the] current war [on] drugs [and] [all] this [kind of] stuff i'd say probably [the] police department [would] claim [the] number [one] crimes , crimes are probably solicitation [of] prostitution [, uh , and] sale [of] drugs . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh ,] major . 
B|61| B: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
A|62| A: [sure] . let somebody [get something] [out] [of] [it] . 
B|63| B: [but] [there's] probably [something else] [that] [might] _make_ [you] . [because] [you] could [know] [about] [, you] could [know] [about] [the] crime , [but] [not] necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury [, you know ,] [not] [be] accepted [for] [the] jury . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [well [,] a] little bit [for] [the] price , 
A|66| A: [right [,] yeah _,] i'm_ [a] graduate student [and ,] let's face _it [,_ i don't] [make] any money [so ,] 
B|67| B: [uh ,] [it [,] there's] some trees [like] [the] oaks , [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] [pretty] hardy . [there's] , nothing bothers them . their leaves are [still] green [, and] some [of] [the other] oaks . there are [a] few oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . [um [,] [what] i] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [, that] [the] leaves are [just] dead [, the] dogwoods [still] [look] , [still] [look] [, you know , they] got [, uh ,] bit [on the] ends [of] [the] leaves [a] little bit , [but] [they] [still] [look] [pretty] good . 
A|68| A: [right .] [and then] [do] [it] [all] [over] again [. uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [how] many stories ? _just one_ ? 
A|70| A: [uh-huh [,] [yeah] .] 
B|71| B: [i] [know] [when] [my] friend's mother-in-law first went [in] [, i mean] , very antisocial . maybe [it] [takes] [a] while [for] them [to] say [, okay [,] well] i'll [be] [with] [other] [people] [but ,] 
A|72| A: [it's] [just one] story . [yeah .] [it's a] fox [and] jacobs _home_ . 
B|73| B: [and then] suddenly he sees [that] [he's] getting [old] [, and] he wants [to be] best friends 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [yeah .] 
A|76| A: [oh ,] except [the] kid , huh [, [that's] ,] 
B|77| B: [and , uh [,] you know [,] that] didn't bother [me] [, uh ,] [too] [much] [, and] [so [,] [i] guess] [it] depends [, um ,] if there are some statistics [that] show [that [,] uh [,] that] [people] [, uh ,] commit crimes [on the] spur [of] [the] moment . 
A|78| A: [sure] . [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [really] . 
A|80| A: [is that] [in] term , 
B|81| B: [most] [people] are , are , retired [or ,] [or ,] [or [,] you know [,] [they're] , they're] [in] their forties [or ,] [or] whatever [. so] [and] [i'm] [in] [my] twenties , [so i] [, i'm] [, i'm] [out] more than [they] are , [but] [they're] [at] [home] [at] night ,
