B|47| B: [if] [it ,] 
A|48| A: _yes_ . [they] , 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] yep , [we] tried [to] convince [my] grandfather [to] [live] with us [at] several points during [the] last few years [of] his [life] [, but] he _was_ essentially [too] proud [and] [too] independent [so] [that] [even] [though] his heart _was_ [getting] incredibly weak [and] his knees _were_ [going] bad he lived [in] his own house as long as he could 
A|50| A: [well ,] _do you_ [think that] [we] [do] [it] [because] [we] want [it] [to] deter [crime] [or [,] it's] [not] [because] [we] [don't] want [to] [pay] _for_ inmates [to] stay [in] prison ? 
B|51| B: [have] , [have] [you] [been] [out] [of the] country ?

A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: [um] . [now] _that would be_ [good .]

B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [oh [,] my] god . 
B|59| B: [and it's] [very] [hard] [for] [me] [because] [, you know [,] it's] [like you] grow [up] [to] [be] twenty years old [, [and] it's] [always] [the] same man 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: absolutely . [yes] [, i] wish [i] had [the] answer _for [that_ ,] everybody does . 
A|62| A: [that would be] nice [. [i] think] [i] saw [that] [on] t v one [time .] [they] , maybe [it] [was] c n n _where_ [they] [were] demonstrating [that] . [or] something similar [to] [that] . 
B|63| B: pardon ? 
A|64| A: [well [,] that is] interesting . [right .]

A|76| A: [i , i ,] actually [i] didn't go diving . 
B|77| B: gorgeous [. [that's] [,] you know [,] [i] think] [you] could drive along [in] maryland [and look at] [the] sweet gum trees [on] each side [and] [the [,] and] [the] pines [and] [what] [not] [, and you] could [, you know [,] you] could [be] driving along [in] [east] texas [and] looks [just] [the] same [. it's] almost [, you know ,] identical [kind of] country . 
A|78| A: [and [,] [and] , but] [we] [are] [going] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks [to] [the] next one [, in] scottsdale , arizona , [for that] family . 
B|79| B: [so] [what] , [what] , how [do you] spend [the] [time] with [your] children ?
