A|44| A: [yeah .] 
B|45| B: [on] [my] driveway [i] guess [that's] [what] [they] [do] [and] then [i] had [to] wheel barrow [it in] . 
A|46| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: [if] [it] 
A|48| A: _yes_ . [they] 
B|49| B: [uh-huh .] yep [we] tried [to] convince [my] grandfather [to] [live] with us [at] several points during [the] last few years [of] his [life] [but] he _was_ essentially [too] proud [and] [too] independent [so] [that] [even] [though] his heart _was_ [getting] incredibly weak [and] his knees _were_ [going] bad he lived [in] his own house as long as he could 
A|50| A: [well] _do you_ [think that] [we] [do] [it] [because] [we] want [it] [to] deter [crime] [or] [it's] [not] [because] [we] [don't] want [to] [pay] _for_ inmates [to] stay [in] prison ? 
B|51| B: [have] [have] [you] [been] [out] [of the] country ? 
A|52| A: [and] _and it's_ least _hard_ [on] _your_ body 
B|53| B: [oh] . [well] 
A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: [um] . [now] _that would be_ [good .]

B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [oh] [my] god . 
B|59| B: [and it's] [very] [hard] [for] [me] [because] [you know] [it's] [like you] grow [up] [to] [be] twenty years old [and it's] [always] [the] same man 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: absolutely . [yes] [i] wish [i] had [the] answer _for that_ everybody does . 
A|62| A: [that would be] nice [. [i] think] [i] saw [that] [on] t v one [time .] [they] maybe [it] [was] c n n _where_ [they] [were] demonstrating [that] . [or] something similar [to] [that] . 
B|63| B: pardon ? 
A|64| A: [well] [that is] interesting . [right .] 
B|65| B: [and] [i'm] [like] [i don't] believe [this] .

A|68| A: okay . 
B|69| B: [uh-huh] 
A|70| A: [yeah .] [yeah .]

A|72| A: [it's] cut back [you know] considerably [but] [it] [it] [just] shifts [it] from [our] neighborhood [to] another neighborhood [to] [other] neighborhood [so] [it] [still] [uh] remains city wide [pretty] [pretty] [high .] 
B|73| B: [right .] 
A|74| A: [really] .

[there] [should] [be] someplace [where] [you] could call [and] [find] [out] . as [a] matter [of] fact [i'm] [pretty] [sure] [there's] [a] place [you can] call [and] [find] [out] [the] closest [you know] [thing] [to] [you] [but [i] think] [there] [should] [be] [some] [kind of] curbside service . 
A|76| A: [i i] actually [i] didn't go diving . 
B|77| B: gorgeous [. that's] [you know [i] think] [you] could drive along [in] maryland [and look at] [the] sweet gum trees [on] each side [and] [the] [and] [the] pines [and] [what] [not] [and you] could [you know you] could [be] driving along [in] [east] texas [and] looks [just] [the] same [. it's] almost [you know] identical [kind of] country . 
A|78| A: [and] [and but] [we] [are] [going] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks [to] [the] next one [in] scottsdale arizona [for that] family . 
B|79| B: [so] [what] [what] how [do you] spend [the] [time] with [your] children ? 
A|80| A: [really ?] [that] [much of] [a] difference ?
