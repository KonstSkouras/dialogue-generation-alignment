B|59| B: _we had_ five children [so] [and] they've [all] moved [you know] _on_ . 
A|60| A: [uh] dallas [is] having quite [a] few . seems [like] most [of] ours are occurring [in] late [at] night [or] [or] [like] [i] say drug related . [uh [i] guess] [the other] [thing] [was] [that] are causing [a lot] [of the] crime now [is] [the] decrease [in] values . seems [like a] [a lot] [of] _people_ [don't] hold human life quite [as] high [as] perhaps [they] used [to] . 
B|61| B: [right .] 
A|62| A: [yeah [.] yeah _.] [right_ .] [uh] [and [and] and] another [good] [thing] [is] [with the] health benefits [when] [they] give [you] [more than two] choices [on] who [to go] [with] . 
B|63| B: [uh] [right] [right [.] right] [right .] 
A|64| A: [but] we've [uh] we've [done] [uh] many types [of] camping . we've we've [done] tent camping [and] [we had] access [to] [a] motor home which [is] [really] super [great] _if you _don't_ want to_ rough [it] [too] much . 
B|65| B: [oh] [sure .] [oh i] bet [it's] beautiful . 
A|66| A: [oh] [yeah] ? 
B|67| B: [right .] 
A|68| A: [yeah] [and] [if you] add [it] [if you] put [a] footnote [in] [in the] middle [you know] [if you] come up [with] [some] new piece [of] documentation [and you] put [that] [in the] middle [of] [your] [paper and] [have to] footnote [it] [you] [just] change um [it] [just] automatically changes [all] [your] footnoting numbers _for_ [you .] 
B|69| B: [like] [like] name [one] 
A|70| A: [uh] [yeah .] [we] actually [do] [some] [work] [with] [some] _people_ [down] [at] georgia tech . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [but] he doesn't bite anybody he's [just] he's [just] [kind of] [there] real friendly [and] docile . 
B|73| B: [uh] [the] [people] [that] [i know] [don't want to] [because] [uh] [they] never [know] [for] [sure] [what] time they're [going to] leave [their] [job] 
A|74| A: [but] pumping [more] money into [the] school [system] [is] [a] [good] [thing] 
B|75| B: [uh-huh . [uh-huh] .] 
A|76| A: [uh i] 
B|77| B: [what] [what] [if] you're [not] doing [it] [in] order [to] circumvent [the] law _though_ ? [i] mean [what] [if you don't] even realize [that] you're [subject] [to] paying [uh] income tax [on] [something] [that you] purchase mail order ? 
A|78| A: [oh] [really] ? 
B|79| B: [so] . 
A|80| A: [well [i] think] [that's] important [for] [your] budget [to be] [for] [it] [to] [work] [though] [you [have] to] [do] [something] . 
B|81| B: [right [.] yeah .] 
A|82| A: [a] chocolate powder . 
B|83| B: no [well] [they] [have] [it] [at] six [and] [they] [have] [it] [at] [nine] 
A|84| A: exactly . 
B|85| B: [i'm] [i'm] [with the] n r [a] myself . 
A|86| A: [you know] . [so] [i] [just] [go] [you know] [we] [have a] [pretty] [good] size pantry [in] our kitchen [and] i've [just] got three trash cans sitting [in] [there] [you know] [we] [just] [kind of] dump [things] [in] each [one] [if [you] know] [if] [we] get [them] 
B|87| B: she'll [be] [two] [in] july . 
A|88| A: [they] [don't have] [any] [they] [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe [they] should [you know] [because] [we're] [all] [going to] get old someday .
