A|60| A: [uh ,] dallas [is] having quite [a] few . seems [like] most [of] ours are occurring [in] late [at] night [or] , [or] [, like] [i] say , drug related . [uh , [i] guess] [the other] [thing] [was] [that] are causing [a lot] [of the] crime now [is] [the] decrease [in] values . seems [like [a] ,] [a lot] [of] _people_ [don't] hold human life quite [as] high [as] perhaps [they] used [to] . 
B|61| B: [right .] 
A|62| A: [yeah [.] yeah _.] [right_ .] [uh [,] [and ,] [and ,] and] another [good] [thing] [is] [with the] health benefits [when] [they] give [you] [more than two] choices [on] who [to go] [with] . 
B|63| B: [uh ,] [right] , [right [.] right] , [right .]

B|69| B: [like] [, like] , name [one] 
A|70| A: [uh [,] [yeah] .] [we] actually [do] [some] [work] [with] [some] _people_ [down] [at] georgia tech . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [but] he doesn't bite anybody he's [just ,] he's [just] [kind of] [there] , real friendly [and] docile . 
B|73| B: [uh [,] the] [people] [that] [i know] [don't want to] [because] [, uh [,] they] never [know] [for] [sure] [what] time they're [going to] leave [their] [job] 
A|74| A: [but ,] pumping [more] money into [the] school [system] [is] [a] [good] [thing ,] 
B|75| B: [uh-huh . [uh-huh] .] 
A|76| A: [uh , [i] ,] 
B|77| B: [what] , [what] [if] you're [not] doing [it] [in] order [to] circumvent [the] law _though_ ? [i] mean [what] [if you don't] even realize [that] you're [subject] [to] paying [, uh ,] income tax [on] [something] [that you] purchase mail order ? 
A|78| A: [oh [,] really] ? 
B|79| B: [so] . 
A|80| A: [well [, i] think] [that's] important [for] [your] budget [to be] [for] [it] [to] [work] [though] [, [you] [have] to] [do] [something] . 
B|81| B: [right [.] yeah .] 
A|82| A: [a] chocolate powder . 
B|83| B: no [, well [,] they] [have] [it] [at] six [and] [they] [have] [it] [at] [nine] , 
A|84| A: exactly . 
B|85| B: [i'm] [i'm] [with the] n r [a] myself . 
A|86| A: [you know] . [so] [i] [just] [go] [, you know ,] [we] [have a] [pretty] [good] size pantry [in] our kitchen [and] i've [just] got three trash cans sitting [in] [there] [, you know ,] [we] [just] [kind of] dump [things] [in] each [one] , [if] [, you know ,] [if] [we] get [them] , 
B|87| B: she'll [be] [two] [in] july . 
A|88| A: [they] [don't have] [any] [, they] [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe [they] should [, you know] [because] [we're] [all] [going to] get old someday .
