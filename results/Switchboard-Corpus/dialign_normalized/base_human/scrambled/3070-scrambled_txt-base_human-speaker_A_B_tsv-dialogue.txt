A|0| A: _right ._ 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ _huh_ . 
A|2| A: _yeah _._ _you know_ _,_ i think_ _people_ _can_ _be_ persuaded _one_ way _or_ _another_ . _i've_ never seriously ran _into_ _someone_ _, i mean_ _like_ , _other_ _than_ _my_ priest _, you know ,_ who _definitely_ _says_ _you_ can't take _a _,_ you know _,_ you_ can't take anyone's life _. uh ,_ anyone _that_ _is_ _like_ _so_ against _it_ _that you_ couldn't persuade them _in_ any instance . 
B|3| B: _right ,_ _we_ wound _up_ _just_ choosing [a ,] [another] mennonite nursing _home_ _that was_ easier _to get_ [into] . [or] _but_ naturally , _no_ _, it was_ even mennonite related _, i'm_ sorry _, it was_ actually _not_ [a] particularly great nursing _home_ . mostly _the_ _thing_ _was_ [that] _it was_ available _when_ _we_ _needed_ _it _,_ _because_ he_ suddenly _got_ sick _and_ _needed_ _to be_ _put_ [in] . 
A|4| A: _yeah _,_ _well _,_ it_ didn't_ _hurt_ _you_ , _did_ [it _,] to _,_ i mean _,_ you_ _didn't_ _go_ _out_ [and] charge [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything , _did_ _you ?_ 
B|5| B: _yeah . [yeah_ .] 
A|6| A: _oh _,_ i_ _have_ . _i've_ _, i've_ _, i_ watched [that] late _, um _, i_ guess_ _it's_ _on_ late saturday nights _or something_ , 
B|7| B: _and , uh ,_ _they've been_ [to] _the_ guadalupe river _, _and_ they_ _also _,_ uh _,_ uh ,_ [have] _been_ _to _, uh [,_ i_ guess] colorado _, and_ _they've_ _really_ enjoyed _it ._ 
A|8| A: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: [yeah .] _i'd like _to_ get_ [one] _of_ _these_ little small ones _, [that_ you] _see_ [in] _all_ _these_ gardening magazines . 
A|10| A: _oh _,_ _well ,_ yeah_ 
B|11| B: [well _, yeah] _,_ when_ [it] _finally_ came _down_ _to [it_ [,] um ,] she _just_ _got_ [to] _the_ _point_ after _the _,_ i mean , it_ wasn't [a] very [, um ,] strong stroke _. it was_ _just_ _kind of_ _all_ _of_ [a] sudden she wasn't herself anymore . 
A|12| A: _right ._ 
B|13| B: _yeah , yeah ._ 
A|14| A: [they've been] released _, you know ,_ _several_ times , _which is_ [another] [, uh ,] deal [i] hate _to see_ . 
B|15| B: [yeah ,] _we_ _have ,_ _we_ [have] _two_ _children_ [that] live [in] pittsburgh 
A|16| A: [i'm] [not] _sure_ [they] need [to be] _, you know ,_ paid _, you know _,_ a_ super _do_ salary [of] any [kind] . 
B|17| B: _yeah _, yeah_ _,_ that's_ _for_ _sure ._ 
A|18| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: _but _i_ am_ _going to [, _to_ ,] uh ,_ hopefully _next_ _year_ _get_ _to go_ _back_ , cause [, uh [,] _a] _lot_ _of_ the_ family has [not] [, uh ,] [on] her side , [my] mother's side , has [not] seen [, you know ,] [my] daughter _, so_ 
A|20| A: [that's] _kind of like_ _where_ we're , 
B|21| B: [uh [,] _uh] ._ 
A|22| A: [yeah _,] i think_ [in] _our_ , [in] _our_ particular neighborhood , vigilantism _is_ becoming [a] real , real possibility . 
B|23| B: _no_ . usually busy fighting _for_ survival . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: whatever _he_ makes , [it's] _all_ _out _of_ the_ same _thing ._ 
A|26| A: [and , uh [,] that's] [a] terrible [kind _of] thing_ [and] _i don't think_ [my] [children] [have] ever [been] subject [to] [that] [but] [my] wife _didn't_ work [and] [so] [we] [really] _didn't_ [have] [that] much exposure [to [it] .] 
B|27| B: _yeah . _yeah_ , yeah ._ 
A|28| A: [uh _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|29| B: [i] [like] _doing_ [that] [kind of] _stuff ._ 
A|30| A: _there_ [was] cartoon [in] cosmo _about a year_ [or] [two] _ago_ _and it_ _had_ _this_ man sitting [on] [a] couch _with_ his date [and] _there_ _were_ _cats_ hanging [all] over _him_ . hanging [on] his clothes [, you know _,] they_ _had_ ripped _him_ [up] _and the_ couch [was] ripped [up] [and] [down] _at the_ bottom [he] said , [of] course [i] love _cats _._ [and_ _they] were_ [just] [all] over _him_ [and] sitting [on] his head _, the_ whole nine yards [. it was] [so] funny . 
B|31| B: _i , i_ [like] [the] _idea_ _that [,_ uh _,] if_ [someone] [is] _from_ [a] foreign country _, [and_ they] come [to] [this] country [and] [uh ,] commit [, a] crime _, i think that_ irregardless [of] whether [they] [have] already become [a] citizen [or] anything [, they] should [be] immediately deported . 
A|32| A: _money_ [from] , _money_ [for] taking care [of the] infants takes _money_ away [from] taking care [of the] elderly _, or_ _do_ [they] both [get] served ? [uh [,] that's] [a] good [point] . 
B|33| B: [right [.] uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [and [,] _i] don't think_ [a] cart damages [the] turf . 
B|35| B: [oh ,] [definitely] . 
A|36| A: _and then_ [finally] [, you know ,] you're lucky [to get] [, you know [,] you] [get] [the] shreveport relatives _there_ _, but_ [no] [one] _else_ [so] [that ,] 
B|37| B: even _if_ _, if_ _they're_ even [in] [that] long . [or] [they] appeal _, [and_ then] [they] [get] an appeal [that] [says] [it _was] [,_ you know ,] an unjust amount [of] _time_ , an extraordinary long length [, [or] something] . 
A|38| A: _okay ,_ take care . 
B|39| B: [they] _always_ say you've talked _your_ _ten_ minute limit . 
A|40| A: _it , it_ sounds [like] [, i mean _,] from_ [the] way [you] described [it] [a] [home] [like] [that] _here_ _would_ [be] _at_ least [two] hundred [and] fifty thousand 
B|41| B: [i] [know] [a] guy [that] upgrades [, uh ,] [for] [a] reasonable cost . 
A|42| A: you're [in] plano [also ,] [huh] ? 
B|43| B: [and the] cardinals [were] [kind of like] [the] [in] fact [they were] _doing_ better [than] _the _cowboys_ , [and_ the] cowboy _, cowboys_ came [on] strong [at the] end [of the] _season_ _, [and_ the] cardinals _got_ killed by _the _cowboys_ _,_ so_ . 
A|44| A: place _that , that_ [needed] [this] . *listen--not [sure] who's saying _what_ 
B|45| B: [and _,] that was_ [the] sort [of thing] [that] [i] [would] say [is] [the] best mumblex [and] [not] news 
A|46| A: [sure _.] okay_ . 
B|47| B: [that's] rather interesting . 
A|48| A: [right .] 
B|49| B: [i guess] [we] [kind of] _started_ _recycling_ after [i] moved [here] [about a year] _and a_ half _ago ._ 
A|50| A: [uh] [i think] [that's] what's made democracy 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [but i] [put] [it] [in] [a] nice glass bowl [and [,] um ,] _some_ _people_ _don't_ [like] _that , [that_ ,] film [on] [the] pudding [so] [you] _can_ [put] [, uh ,] saran wrap over [the] top . 
B|53| B: _uh [, i_ think] [, i think] _, uh , the_ system _right _now_ [,_ you know ,] should [, you know ,] [is] fine _. i think_ [it] should [be] by [a] jury _. [i_ don't think] [the] judge should _have [,_ i mean] he's [just] [there] [kind of like] [the] referee 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [huh] ? 
B|57| B: [well , [it] , it] [sure] seems [to] save lives [and] 
A|58| A: [i [, i] think that] [would] [be] [, [i] am] [sure] [there] [is] [something] [out] [there] [, uh ,] , 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [right .] 
B|61| B: [but] [our] shepherd _was almost_ thirteen _years old _,_ [and_ it] _just , you know ,_ _was almost_ cruel _because_ , 
A|62| A: [yeah [,] i mean] [it [, it] was] [really] exciting , growing [up] [when] [, when] [the cowboys] [were] [really] big . [because] [my] parents [would] [always] [have] [season] tickets [, and] they'd [go] [to] [all] [the] games [, and] [you know [,] the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . [it's] [just , you know [,] the] last , [oh] [i guess] probably since [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they] [started] [kind of] [going] downhill [really] _, but [,_ you know [,] i'm] [just] used [to] [always] growing [up] [and] hearing [cowboys [,] [cowboys] [,] [cowboys] , [and] [,] you know ,] super bowl [, and] [all] [this] _other_ [stuff .] _so [,_ i] can't [, you know [,] i'm] [not] [going to] decide [i don't] [like] them [just] [because] [they're] having [a] few bad [years] _. i mean [, i_ think] they'll pull [out of] [it [,] [and] [,] you know ,] they'll , they'll wind [up] being good again . [they've] [got] _some_ , [lot of] [really] good young players [that] _are_ [going to [,] that] _are_ [going [to ,] uh ,] _do_ pretty good [, i think] . _but ,_ [they're] raising prices [on] their tickets . [so] [they're] banking [on] [doing] good [next] [season] [. i think] tickets _are_ , 
B|63| B: [but [,] uh _,] [so_ [,] you] [do] recycle , [don't] [you ?] 
A|64| A: [you know [,] you] _can_ bury [a] piece [of] yellow paper [, it] will still [be] [there] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks . 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [yeah] [that] [would] [be] [a] good [idea] . 
B|67| B: [yeah [.] uh-huh [.] i mean _, i] , i_ tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. i think] [, uh ,] [what] [i] [would] _like [to_ see] [is] , number _one ,_ completely getting rid [of] _these_ victimless crimes [. uh ,] there's [no] _reason_ [to] enforce those [and] spend _time_ [and] [money] [doing] [it] [and [,] and] worry [about] _these_ _things_ [where] [people] [are] getting [hurt] . 
A|68| A: _okay [,_ the] topic [is] social changes [and] discuss social changes [in] america [and] how [they] relate [, or] how [they] differ today [than] [they were] [ten] , fifteen [or] thirty [years] [ago .] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [right [,] that's] critical [, because] she's [in] need [of] [it] [so] often . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh _.] [yeah_ .] 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| B: [i] [can] imagine , [my] lord . 
A|74| A: [yeah , yeah .] [that's] [another] [thing _.] you_ [have] [to go] [to] different places [to] [do] [that] . 
B|75| B: [and , uh [,] it didn't] seem [like] [it was] [that] congested [in] [that , that] part [. you know] [because] [to] _me_ [where] [we] live [out] [here] _in the_ north east [, [it] ,] [it's] [there] [are] _a [lot_ of] buildings very close [to] each [other] , 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: _i had a_ cat [, i've] [had] [several] [cats .] [my] pet [, uh ,] [was] hit by [a] car _new_ year's eve [, but [,] uh ,] 
A|78| A: bye . 
B|79| B: [um [,] well [,] _the] ,_ [see] [, uh [,] well ,] [we] , [he] wanted [to get] [into] [a] mennonite nursing [home] [which is] very popular [and] hard [to get] [into] [and] [had] _like a_ [ten] [year] waiting list 
A|80| A: first [one [,] you know] how [that] [is] _. [and_ [,] um [,] uh , i] play [the] guitar [and a] banjo [. i] mainly play [the] guitar [a lot] [, i] play [about] every night _. [and_ _,] um , i_ [really] love [that [,] if] [i had a] druther [, if] [i] could [have [,] if] [i] could make _it on_ [the] road , [i'd like to] play [on] [like a] bluegrass band [or something] [, because] [that's] [, i've] , 
B|81| B: [yeah [.] and] [don't] [they] [go] [into] [other] countries [and] [stuff] ? 
A|82| A: [that's] [it .] 
B|83| B: _um [._ [okay] [,] and] [did] , 
A|84| A: [um ,] [are] [you] working [right now] ? 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [um [,] so] [that [was] [,] that was] [one] [reason] why [i] never considered [it] [but] [now] [that] [i'm] further along [, and] [i'm] still paying [these] college loans [, i [, i] think] realistically [, you know [,] you] [can] [have] [your] college loans delayed [now [,] because] [i had] them delayed [because] [i'm] [back] [in] graduate school [at] thirty [years old ,] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh _.] [yeah_ [.] and] [are] [they] tested random ? 
A|88| A: [um .] 
B|89| B: [and , uh ,] [we] [, i] [do] [some] interesting _recycling_ _things_ . 
A|90| A: [that [was] [,] that _was] a_ big [thing] [with] _him_ . 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] [where] [do] [you] play golf [in] [this] area ? 
B|93| B: [you] [do] [the] same . 
A|94| A: [not] [this] past fall [but [i] mean] fall [, a] few [years] [, i mean , it] [it was] [in [the] [,] yeah [,] it [was] almost] [like] october [of] eighty-five , 
B|95| B: [uh [,] well [,] uh [,] from] [what] [we] [can] _tell_ [it [was] a] pellet gun [and then] [he] [started] chasing [him] [with] [a] bull whip . 
A|96| A: [and , uh ,] 
B|97| B: crazy [. uh [,] well ,] [is] [there] anything [else] you'd [like to] share _me_ [about] [your] _recycling_ philosophy , julie ? 
A|98| A: [in] , [in the] whole scope [of] [things] [this] isn't [going to , to] [have] any real affect [on] , what's [going] [on] [in the] street . 
B|99| B: [it's] , 
A|100| A: [uh ,] probably [the] favorite instrument [would] [be] [, uh , the] violin . 
B|101| B: [yeah [,] if] [they] [really] [can] [, um [, i] think] [the] [the] biggest problem [i've] [got] [is] , [is] forcing [it on] [someone] after [they've] already agreed [to] [the] terms [of] employment . 
A|102| A: [yeah . yeah] [my] husband [was] complaining [the] [other] day [because he] said every [time] [i] turn around you're telling [me] [some] [new] rule [about] [recycling] [like] yesterday [i] [was] [tell] [him] [, you] [have] [to ,] you're supposed [to] squeeze [the] plastic jugs before [you] take them [up] [there] . 
B|103| B: w r r [and the] oasis [are] [the] [two] [that] [i] listen [to ,] more [than] anything [else] . 
B|104| B: [so ,]
