A|0| A: _right ._ 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ _huh_ . 
A|2| A: _yeah _._ you know_ _i think_ _people_ _can_ _be_ persuaded _one_ way _or_ _another_ . _i've_ never seriously ran _into_ _someone_ _i mean_ _like_ _other_ _than_ _my_ priest _you know_ who _definitely_ _says_ _you_ can't take _a_ _you know_ _you_ can't take anyone's life _. uh_ anyone _that_ _is_ _like_ _so_ against _it_ _that you_ couldn't persuade them _in_ any instance . 
B|3| B: [right] _we_ wound _up_ _just_ choosing [a] [another] mennonite nursing _home_ _that was_ easier _to get_ [into] . [or] _but_ naturally _no_ _it was_ even mennonite related _i'm_ sorry _it was_ actually _not_ [a] particularly great nursing _home_ . mostly _the_ _thing_ _was that_ _it was_ available _when_ _we_ _needed_ [it] _because he_ suddenly _got_ sick _and_ _needed_ _to be_ _put_ [in] . 
A|4| A: _yeah_ _well _it_ didn't_ _hurt_ _you_ _did_ [it] [to] _i mean_ _you_ _didn't_ _go_ _out_ [and] charge [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything _did_ _you ?_ 
B|5| B: _yeah . [yeah_ .] 
A|6| A: _oh_ _i_ _have_ . _i've_ _i've_ _i_ watched [that] late _um _i_ guess_ _it's_ _on_ late saturday nights _or something_ 
B|7| B: _and uh_ _they've been_ [to] _the_ guadalupe river _and they_ _also_ [uh] [uh] [have] _been_ _to _uh_ [i_ guess] colorado [and] _they've_ _really_ enjoyed _it ._ 
A|8| A: [uh-huh _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: [yeah .] _i'd like _to_ get_ [one] _of_ _these_ little small ones [that you] _see_ [in] _all_ _these_ gardening magazines . 
A|10| A: _oh_ _well yeah_ 
B|11| B: [well yeah] _when_ [it] _finally_ came _down_ _to it_ [um] she _just_ _got_ [to] _the_ _point_ after _the_ _i mean it_ wasn't [a] very [um] strong stroke _. it was_ _just_ _kind of_ _all_ _of_ [a] sudden she wasn't herself anymore . 
A|12| A: _right ._ 
B|13| B: _yeah yeah ._ 
A|14| A: [they've been] released _you know_ _several_ times _which is_ [another] [uh] deal [i] hate _to see_ . 
B|15| B: [yeah] _we_ [have] _we_ [have] _two_ _children_ [that] live [in] pittsburgh 
A|16| A: [i'm] [not] _sure_ [they] need [to be] _you know_ paid _you _know_ a_ super _do_ salary [of] any [kind] . 
B|17| B: _yeah yeah_ _that's_ _for_ _sure ._ 
A|18| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: _but _i_ am_ _going to _to_ uh_ hopefully _next_ _year_ _get_ _to go_ _back_ cause [uh] _a _lot_ _of_ the_ family has [not] [uh] [on] her side [my] mother's side has [not] seen [you know] [my] daughter [so] 
A|20| A: [that's] _kind of like_ _where_ we're 
B|21| B: [uh] _uh ._ 
A|22| A: [yeah] _i think_ [in] _our_ [in] _our_ particular neighborhood vigilantism _is_ becoming [a] real real possibility . 
B|23| B: _no_ . usually busy fighting _for_ survival . 
A|24| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: whatever _he_ makes [it's] _all_ _out _of_ the_ same _thing ._ 
A|26| A: [and uh] [that's] [a] terrible [kind _of] thing_ [and] _i don't think_ [my] [children] [have] ever [been] subject [to] [that] [but] [my] wife _didn't_ work [and] [so] [we] [really] _didn't_ [have] [that] much exposure [to [it] .] 
B|27| B: _yeah . _yeah_ yeah ._ 
A|28| A: [uh _.] uh-huh ._ 
B|29| B: [i] [like] _doing_ [that] [kind of] _stuff ._ 
A|30| A: _there_ [was] cartoon [in] cosmo _about a year_ [or] [two] _ago_ _and it_ _had_ _this_ man sitting [on] [a] couch _with_ his date [and] _there_ _were_ _cats_ hanging [all] over _him_ . hanging [on] his clothes [you know] [they] _had_ ripped _him_ [up] _and the_ couch [was] ripped [up] [and] [down] _at the_ bottom [he] said [of] course [i] love _cats _._ [and_ _they] were_ [just] [all] over _him_ [and] sitting [on] his head [the] whole nine yards [. it was] [so] funny . 
B|31| B: _i i_ [like] [the] _idea_ [that] [uh] _if_ [someone] [is] _from_ [a] foreign country [and they] come [to] [this] country [and uh] commit [a] crime _i think that_ irregardless [of] whether [they] [have] already become [a] citizen [or] anything [they] should [be] immediately deported . 
A|32| A: _money_ [from] _money_ [for] taking care [of the] infants takes _money_ away [from] taking care [of the] elderly [or] _do_ [they] both [get] served ? [uh] [that's] [a] good [point] . 
B|33| B: [right [.] uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [and] _i don't think_ [a] cart damages [the] turf . 
B|35| B: [oh] [definitely] . 
A|36| A: _and then_ [finally] [you know] you're lucky [to get] [you know] [you] [get] [the] shreveport relatives _there_ [but] [no] [one] _else_ [so] [that] 
B|37| B: even _if_ _if_ _they're_ even [in] [that] long . [or] [they] appeal [and then] [they] [get] an appeal [that] [says] [it was] [you know] an unjust amount [of] _time_ an extraordinary long length [or something] . 
A|38| A: _okay_ take care . 
B|39| B: [they] _always_ say you've talked _your_ _ten_ minute limit . 
A|40| A: _it it_ sounds [like] [i mean] [from] [the] way [you] described [it] [a] [home] [like] [that] _here_ _would_ [be] _at_ least [two] hundred [and] fifty thousand 
B|41| B: [i] [know a] guy [that] upgrades [uh] [for] [a] reasonable cost . 
A|42| A: you're [in] plano [also] [huh] ? 
B|43| B: [and the] cardinals [were] [kind of like] [the] [in] fact [they were] _doing_ better [than] _the _cowboys_ [and_ the] cowboy _cowboys_ came [on] strong [at the] end [of the] _season_ [and the] cardinals _got_ killed by _the cowboys_ [so] . 
A|44| A: place _that that_ [needed] [this] . *listen--not [sure] who's saying _what_ 
B|45| B: [and] _that was_ [the] sort [of thing] [that] [i] [would] say [is] [the] best mumblex [and] [not] news 
A|46| A: [sure _.] okay_ . 
B|47| B: [that's] rather interesting . 
A|48| A: [right .] 
B|49| B: [i guess] [we] [kind of] _started_ _recycling_ after [i] moved [here] [about a year] _and a_ half _ago ._ 
A|50| A: _uh i think_ [that's] what's made democracy 
B|51| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [but i] [put] [it] [in] [a] nice glass bowl [and] [um] _some_ _people_ _don't_ [like] _that that_ film [on] [the] pudding _so you_ _can_ [put] [uh] saran wrap over [the] top . 
B|53| B: [uh i think] [i think] _uh the_ system _right now_ [you know] should [you know] [is] fine _. i think_ [it] should [be] by [a] jury _. [i_ don't think] [the] judge should [have] [i mean] he's [just] [there] [kind of like] [the] referee 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [huh] ? 
B|57| B: [well [it] it] [sure] seems [to] save lives [and] 
A|58| A: [i [i] think that] [would] [be] [i am] [sure] [there] [is] [something] [out] [there] [uh] 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [right .] 
B|61| B: [but] [our] shepherd _was almost_ thirteen _years old_ [and it] _just you know_ _was almost_ cruel _because_ 
A|62| A: [yeah] [i mean [it] [it] was] [really] exciting growing [up] [when] [when] [the cowboys] [were] [really] big . [because] [my] parents [would] [always] [have] [season] tickets [and] they'd [go] [to] [all] [the] games [and] [you know] [the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . [it's] [just you know] [the] last [oh] [i guess] probably since [about] eighty-four [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they] [started] [kind of] [going] downhill [really] [but] [you know] [i'm] [just] used [to] [always] growing [up] [and] hearing [cowboys] [cowboys] [cowboys and] [you know] super bowl [and] [all] [this] _other_ [stuff .] [so] [i] can't [you know] [i'm] [not] [going to] decide [i don't] [like] them [just] [because] [they're] having [a] few bad [years] _. i mean [i_ think] they'll pull [out of] _it and_ [you know] they'll they'll wind [up] being good again . [they've] [got] _some_ [lot of] [really] good young players [that] _are_ [going to] [that] _are_ [going [to] uh] _do_ pretty good [i think] . [but] [they're] raising prices [on] their tickets . [so] [they're] banking [on] [doing] good [next] [season] [. i think] tickets _are_ 
B|63| B: [but] [uh] [so you] [do] recycle [don't] [you ?] 
A|64| A: [you know] [you] _can_ bury [a] piece [of] yellow paper [it] will still [be] [there] [in] [a] couple [of] weeks . 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [yeah] [that] [would] [be] [a] good [idea] . 
B|67| B: [yeah [.] uh-huh [.] i mean [i] i] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. i think] [uh] [what] [i] [would] _like [to_ see] [is] number [one] completely getting rid [of] _these_ victimless crimes [. uh] there's [no] _reason_ [to] enforce those [and] spend _time_ [and] [money] [doing] [it and] [and] worry [about] _these_ _things_ [where] [people] [are] getting [hurt] . 
A|68| A: _okay_ [the] topic [is] social changes [and] discuss social changes [in] america [and] how [they] relate [or] how [they] differ today [than] [they were] [ten] fifteen [or] thirty [years] [ago .] 
B|69| B: [yeah .] 
A|70| A: [right] [that's] critical [because] she's [in] need [of] [it] [so] often . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh _.] [yeah_ .] 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| B: [i] [can] imagine [my] lord . 
A|74| A: [yeah yeah .] [that's] [another] [thing _.] you_ [have] [to go] [to] different places [to] [do] [that] . 
B|75| B: [and uh] [it didn't] seem [like] [it _was] that_ congested [in] [that that] part [. you know] [because] [to] _me_ [where] [we] live [out] [here] _in the_ north east [it] [it's] [there] [are] _a [lot_ of] buildings very close [to] each [other] 
A|76| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: _i had a_ cat [i've] [had] [several] [cats .] [my] pet [uh] [was] hit by [a] car _new_ year's eve [but] [uh] 
A|78| A: bye . 
B|79| B: [um] [well] [the] [see] [uh] [well] [we] [he] wanted [to get] [into] [a] mennonite nursing [home] [which is] very popular [and] hard [to get] [into] [and] [had] _like a_ [ten] [year] waiting list 
A|80| A: first [one] [you know] how [that] [is] _. and_ [um] [uh i] play [the] guitar [and a] banjo [. i] mainly play [the] guitar [a lot] [i] play [about] every night _. and_ _um i_ [really] love [that] [if] [i had a] druther [if] [i] could [have] [if] [i] could make _it on_ [the] road [i'd like to] play [on] [like a] bluegrass band [or something] [because] [that's] [i've] 
B|81| B: [yeah [.] and] [don't] [they] [go] [into] [other] countries [and] [stuff] ? 
A|82| A: [that's] [it .] 
B|83| B: _um [._ okay] [and] [did] 
A|84| A: [um] [are] [you] working [right now] ? 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [um] [so] [that [was] [that] was] [one] [reason] why [i] never considered [it] [but] [now] [that] [i'm] further along [and] [i'm] still paying [these] college loans [i [i] think] realistically [you know] [you] [can] [have] [your] college loans delayed [now] [because] [i had] them delayed [because] [i'm] [back] [in] graduate school [at] thirty [years old] 
B|87| B: [uh-huh _.] [yeah_ [.] and] [are] [they] tested random ? 
A|88| A: [um .] 
B|89| B: [and uh] [we] [i] [do] [some] interesting _recycling_ _things_ . 
A|90| A: [that [was] [that] _was] a_ big [thing] [with] _him_ . 
B|91| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|92| A: [uh-huh .] [where] [do] [you] play golf [in] [this] area ? 
B|93| B: [you] [do] [the] same . 
A|94| A: [not] [this] past fall [but [i] mean] fall [a] few [years] [i mean [it] [it] was] [in the] [yeah] [it [was] almost] [like] october [of] eighty-five 
B|95| B: [uh] [well] [uh] [from] [what] [we] [can] _tell_ [it [was] a] pellet gun [and then] [he] [started] chasing [him] [with] [a] bull whip . 
A|96| A: [and uh] 
B|97| B: crazy [. uh] [well] [is] [there] anything [else] you'd [like to] share _me_ [about] [your] _recycling_ philosophy julie ? 
A|98| A: [in] [in the] whole scope [of] [things] [this] isn't [going to to] [have] any real affect [on] what's [going] [on] [in the] street . 
B|99| B: [it's] 
A|100| A: [uh] probably [the] favorite instrument [would] [be] [uh the] violin . 
B|101| B: [yeah] [if] [they] [really] [can] [um [i] think] [the] [the] biggest problem [i've] [got] [is] [is] forcing [it on] [someone] after [they've] already agreed [to] [the] terms [of] employment . 
A|102| A: [yeah . yeah] [my] husband [was] complaining [the] [other] day [because he] said every [time] [i] turn around you're telling [me] [some] [new] rule [about] [recycling] [like] yesterday [i] [was] [tell] [him] [you] [have] [to] you're supposed [to] squeeze [the] plastic jugs before [you] take them [up] [there] . 
B|103| B: w r r [and the] oasis [are] [the] [two] [that] [i] listen [to] more [than] anything [else] . 
B|104| B: [so]
