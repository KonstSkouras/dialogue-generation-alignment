B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _what_ _do you_ _use_ _it_ _for_ ? 
B|3| B: _yeah _._ uh_ [like] september [was] hot _and_ dry october . 
A|4| A: _that_ _that_ _kind of_ gripes _on_ _me_ _some_ _but_ _but _i_ don't _know_ ._ 
B|5| B: _yeah ._ 
A|6| A: _oh_ _is that_ _right_ ? 
B|7| B: [do you] want _to hear_ _about_ _my_ other animals _i've_ _had_ ?

B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [yeah .] 
B|11| B: [yeah] yep 
A|12| A: _oh_ _they_ [do] _too_ _. and_ _they're_ impossible [to] crush _. i mean_ [you] can't _get_ _the_ _down_ [to] any _size_ _you know ._ _if_ [you] _get_ four milk cartons [and] _that_ fills _up_ trash bag _you know_ _pretty_ easily _so_ _. you know_ 
B|13| B: _right ._ 
A|14| A: _i don't know_ _how_ americans _are_ [about] handguns _but_ [uh] yesterday _a_ lady _i_ _work_ _with_ _just_ told _me_ today _that uh_ _in the_ state capitol _here_ _in_ austin _texas_ _they had_ _been_ [uh] looking _at_ _a_ bill [uh] making _it_ easier [to] accept _the_ bill [to] access [to] access handguns [and] _they_ passed _it_ _which_ basically means without _an_ f b _i_ check any person _here_ _in_ _this_ state over twenty-one _can_ _get_ _a_ gun 
B|15| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _i think_ _he's_ dead _now_ _but_ he plays wonderfully . 
B|17| B: [but i] [i] usually [just] read through [the] sections [on] [on] domestic _stuff ._ 
A|18| A: [and] _they_ _say_ _it's_ _going to_ last [about] _two_ [to] _three_ weeks _. and_ _this_ _guy_ _in_ front _of_ _me_ _said_ [i] can't believe _i was_ summonsed _. _i_ was_ _an_ investigator _and _i_ was_ tailing [the] woman _that_ [was] killed . _well_ _then_ _i have_ _a_ friend _at_ _school_ _that_ _has_ _a_ boyfriend _that's_ _a_ lawyer [and] he _said_ _that_ _this_ woman _this_ socialite _in_ plano [had] hired four _guys_ [to] kill _her_ husband _and the_ _one_ _that's_ accused [was] [the] _one_ _that_ _actually_ _did_ _it _._ _and_ she_ _has_ since taken _off_ _with_ _another_ lawyer who [had] _been_ [uh] getting cocaine _from_ his client [and] _then_ selling _it_ [and] he [had] skipped bail [and] _they_ finally extradited him [and] _he's_ _going to_ testify _for the_ state against _her_ _so_ he'll _have_ his sentence reduced . 
B|19| B: [you know] _there's_ nothing [in] _there_ _that can_ wrap _around the_ [the] [uh] rollers [or] _anything_ . [it] seems [like] [a] _really_ _good_ answer [to] portable music _that you_ [can] choose . 
A|20| A: [yeah .] 
B|21| B: _we're_ [in] sherman . 
A|22| A: _oh_ [yeah .] 
B|23| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|24| A: _yes_ . 
B|25| B: [uh] [the] nissan came _and and_ _we_ bought [the] nissan [for] functional purposes _not_ [what] [the] consumer reports [said] _we_ should [get] . 
A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: [you know] once [you] make [that] step [you know] [that] _it's_ [just] _going _to_ be_ downhill _from_ _then_ [on] [and and] _i've seen_ _people_ [really] fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to] make [the] _change_ . 
B|29| B: _oh ._ 
A|30| A: [and] _then_ _those_ convicted especially _of_ [you know] murder [and _and] uh_ [you know] major crimes _uh to_ reach [the] life sentences _and [you_ know] death penalties [and] follow-through _with_ _that ._ 
B|31| B: [yeah] [she] only taught _there_ [one] year [but i] 
A|32| A: _no_ _i have_ _no_ _idea_ _. _i_ don't_ _think _i_ don't_ _think that_ [was] _on a_ b c anyway _i don't know_ [what] happened [to] [it] _though ._ 
B|33| B: [yes] [i] understand . 
A|34| A: _well_ listen _uh _i_ think_ _i've i've_ exhausted [my] [uh] self [on] _at_ least [i've] blown _off_ steam _of the_ _way_ [i] feel [about] _it ._ 
B|35| B: [uh] almost [an] addition _uh [and_ [and] and] _we_ could equate [or] relate relay [well] _to some_ [of the] newspaper [and] television articles [about] [the] fact [that] [people] _where_ _having_ [this] _problem_ _in in_ unhooking uncoupling _from the_ events [and] [going] _on with_ _their_ _. so_ 
A|36| A: [so] _well _i_ don't _know_ that's_ [my] [my] great _hard_ recipe . 
B|37| B: [yeah] [he's] _a pretty_ _nice_ [guy] . 
A|38| A: _how_ _would_ [you] _go about_ organizing [a] _family_ reunion ? 
B|39| B: _um_ . 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: _you're_ [going _to] have_ [on] extra expenses [for] car . 
A|42| A: [yeah .] _yeah _i think_ _i_ mean_ _that's_ [pretty] _that's_ [a pretty] _important_ [uh] _part_ [of] [it] [there] _because_ [that] [that can] _be_ [really] expensive _if_ [you] ever [have] any health _problems_ . [my] dad _i think_ [my] _i'm_ still covered [on with] [my] dad's [uh] health plan _at_ his [where] he _works_ [but] _it would_ definitely _be_ _something_ [to] look into once [i] [get] [my] own . 
B|43| B: [and] _a lot of_ _them_ decide [just] _not _to_ have_ _children_ . 
A|44| A: _okay_ _have you_ participated [in] [anything] _like that_ ? 
B|45| B: _uh-huh_ [yeah _i] really_ [do] [because] [i] [like] _to get_ [you know] [get] [off] alone [and] [just] _do that_ [for] [a] while [but] [that's] [hard] [you know .] 
A|46| A: _you know it's_ [just] _but it's_ frightening [to] _us_ [because] [we] live [pretty] far [from] _her_ . she's _down_ [in] temple 
B|47| B: [uh] ... 
A|48| A: _it's_ gorgeous absolutely gorgeous . [the] coastline [was] [just] incredible . _it's_ huge . 
B|49| B: wow . 
A|50| A: _i was_ [a] student [there] [and] spent [um] [a] semester studying abroad [in] london . 
B|51| B: _uh-huh ._ ooh . _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|52| A: [so] _it was_ [pretty] much [a] physical decision ? 
B|53| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|54| A: [good] point . [that's] [a] [good] point . 
B|55| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|56| A: _that's coming_ _up_ _here_ [pretty] soon . _is_ [it] [this] weekend ? 
B|57| B: [i] _got_ [my] certification _. but_ [actually] [they] [did] _not_ _teach_ [us] _very_ _many_ _things_ [about] [how] [really] [to] [go about] helping [people] [to] learn [another] language 
A|58| A: [so] [do you] _think it was_ overdeveloped _then_ ? 
B|59| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|60| A: [right .] [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [and] _all_ _of a_ sudden _you've got to_ [do] [something] _else_ . 
A|62| A: [oh] man . 
B|63| B: [i mean] _as_ _you're_ walking through [that] _little_ tour _in uh_ munich [it's] [kind of] [they're] trying [to] brainwash [you] [too] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: _i've heard_ [too] _many_ _people say_ [i] hate [it] [here] . 
A|66| A: [yeah i] [heard] _that ._ [it's] [it's] _daughter_ [it's] his _daughter_ [that] 
B|67| B: t- _whether_ [my] dentist [or] 
A|68| A: [yeah .] 
B|69| B: [and the] garages _were_ always [if] [the] house [was] large [it] seemed [like] [the] garages _were_ small even _if they_ _were_ [three] car garages [which] [is] [what] _we _have_ ._ 
A|70| A: dye mound ? 
B|71| B: [the] whole [family] [was] [so] disappointed 
A|72| A: [and] _when_ [you're] [as] busy [as] _one of_ _those_ babies [you've got to] eat most [of _the] _time_ ._ 
B|73| B: [and uh] [that's] _more_ [important] _than_ [anything] _else_ . [we] could [have] _sent_ [uh] [her] [to] [a] fancier [uh] facility . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [it's] [like] [i] [said] [at] _our_ expense . 
A|76| A: _but then_ [it] _depends on_ who [you] _are_ calling [on] . who [you're] [you] [like] _your_ minister standing _up in_ front [of] [you] [with] _no_ tie _you just_ [uh] he _would_ _be_ missing [something] . 
B|77| B: _oh i_ . 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [and the] neighborhoods _are_ stable [you know .] 
B|81| B: _oh _i_ [know_ .] 
A|82| A: [right .] 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [right .] 
B|85| B: [well i] [i] collect antique tools [uh] [for] [one] _thing_ [i] [well] [i'm] _sort of_ [in] [an] antique business [but it's] _a little_ sideline [part] [time] _thing ._ 
A|86| A: [and _uh] _i_ was_ [kind of] _interested_ [to hear] cause _they had_ [some] [people] [from the] e p [a] [and] lots [of] different places 
B|87| B: [but] [that] _same_ house [here] you'd pay almost six thousand _dollars_ [a] year taxes [on] [it .] 
A|88| A: [i] 
B|89| B: [and you] [can] give [me] eighties 
A|90| A: huh-uh . 
B|91| B: [well] [you know] _but you_ made [the] comment earlier why [would] someone [be] [interested] [in] _children_ [. i mean] [it] [has] _been a_ real [uh] [there] _have been_ [some] [good] entrepreneurial type experiences [. [and] [i] think [i] think] [they] [have] captured [a] certain market . again [the] [but then] [there] [are] baby-sitting groups . [as] [a] pediatrician [one [of] the] _things_ _we've_ [been] real concerned [about] [is] [the] infections . 
A|92| A: [and i] _thought_ [you know] [that] [really] _now_ [that] [i'm] thirty _years_ old _i think that_ [one] [or] _two_ _years_ _out _of_ my_ life [would] [have] _probably_ [like] [you] [said] _to be_ able [to] travel [some] place [else] [whether] [it] [be] [the] united states [or] outside _the country_ _i think _it_ would_ [have [been] a] [very] [good] [um] experience [for] [me] . 
B|93| B: [and _i] know_ _a lot of people_ [it would] [would] solve [the] convenience _problem_ _if [they_ had] curbside pickup _and some_ communities [are] trying [to] _do that_ [now] [. [and] [i] think that] maybe _if they_ only charged [for the] garbage _that you_ [did] _not_ _sort_ [and] [have] set [up] [for] recycling 
A|94| A: [i] [did] [a lot of] [just] [going] _out_ by myself [and] riding _on the_ subway [and] watching [people] . 
B|95| B: [i don't know] [yeah [i [think] it] was] . 
A|96| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [you're] _probably_ [right] _two_ _years_ might [be] [a little] [too] long . 
B|97| B: [right .] [there] [for] [a] while [that] [would] [that] _worked_ . _we've_ [uh _i] _know_ [i_ have] [um] i'll stick [to] [uh to] [the] [you know] sometimes i'll stick [to] [a] certain party [depends [on] the] [guy] . 
A|98| A: [and [uh] and] [on] huge doses [of] antibiotics [and] he [actually] [got] over [it] [with] seven hundred [dollars] [in] vet bills 
B|99| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: _okay ._ 
B|101| B: _i really_ [like] [those] [in] fact _i had_ [a] harpsichord played [at] [my] wedding . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [that's] [right .] [if] [i have] [a] [problem] discipline [you [know] [i] think] [now] boy [i really] need [to get] _out_ [you know] [and] apply [something] [you know] [and i] screw [around] [and] [don't] [do] _it or_ wait [too] long _or something_ . 
B|105| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [well] [that's] [a] full [time] job . 
B|107| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [oh] [really] . 
B|109| B: [oh] [do] [they] ? 
A|110| A: [oh _i] think that's_ great . 
B|111| B: [oh now] [that's] neat . 
A|112| A: [but i] find [that] _when_ [you] [do [that] you] [do] [more] chatting [than] [you] [do] exercise 
B|113| B: [well _i] [know_ it's] [hard] [for] young [people] [to] [think] [about] giving [up] _their_ [years] [you know] _their_ carefree [years] 
A|114| A: [yeah .] 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: [right] [right] [that's] [uh] 
B|117| B: [right .] [then] [you] [can] [just] _sort of_ [have] pictures [to] [go] along [with] [it [or] something] [because] [really] [i've] [thought] lately _there's_ nothing new [in [the] time] magazine . 
A|118| A: everyone [would] _appeal_ . _that's true_ [too] . 
B|119| B: [is _that] [is_ that] [good] ? [you know] [i've seen] [that] [so] _many_ times _strawberries_ dipped [in] chocolate [but] [i've] _never_ tried [it] [are] [they] [really] [good] ? 
A|120| A: [it] [is] [because] [they] 
B|121| B: [i think that's] [one] reason _we have_ [problems] [in] schools [uh _and] some_ [of] _them_ [are] _our_ [problems] [but] [a lot of] [it's] [because] _everything_ society wants [we] [are] supposed [to] [do] . 
A|122| A: [i think that] once [you] [do that] _your_ [children] [kind of] develop [the] [same] attitudes . [at] least [my] daughters [have .] [they] try [to] [teach] theirs [not [to] get] into [things] instead [of] [having] [to] put [everything] [up] [. _so] it's_ [worked] [pretty] [well] . [there's] [i don't] [really] [think] anything's [been] broken . _every_ [now] [and] [then] [we _have] to_ [kind of] [go] [and] [say] [now] [don't] bother [this] [you know .] 
B|123| B: [i] always take home baked bread . 
A|124| A: aids research [is] [something] [that] _that [i_ think] [whether] [our] _country_ [is] putting enough money into [it] 
B|125| B: _so we_ [we] rely [pretty] [pretty] heavily [i think] [on a] combination [of the] [of the] [two] [. i] also [uh] [use] [uh] newsweek magazine _. uh_ 
A|126| A: [so we] [never] [really] spent [that] much [time] [at] [the] campground [as] much [as] [we] [did] 
B|127| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: makes [a lot of] difference . 
B|129| B: [yeah] [i've _i've] heard_ _of [that_ .] 
A|130| A: _oh okay_ [i know] [where] [that is] . 
B|131| B: [and] does _the company_ pay [for] [it [.] you know] _all_ [or] partially [or] [how] does [that] [work] . 
A|132| A: [yes] . [my] son [is] [in] both band [and] scouts [too] . 
B|133| B: [i] rely primarily [on] [uh] newspaper combined [with] television . 
A|134| A: _no ._ 
B|135| B: [well [i] have] [seen] [a] big [change] [i think] [in] high [school] _kids_ [that] [my] relatives [and] friends [that] [um] [i know] [when] [i was] [in] high [school] _i had_ [an] [idea] [of] [what] [i really] wanted [to] [do] [with] [what] [my] [what] [i was] [going to] study 
A|136| A: [oh] [yeah] [all] [that] hoedown [stuff .] 
B|137| B: [it's] [you know it's] [a] game [to] [her] [but i] [i] [do] [not] [like] [to] [do [that] i] consider [it] [kind _of] a_ [a] waste [of my] [time [.] _and] so_ [i'm] usually [uh] [pretty] careful [when] [i] shop 
A|138| A: [you know it's] [i think] [it's] [very] difficult [in the] first place [to] make [that] choice [to have] [them] [go] [there] . 
B|139| B: [yeah] [that's true] . 
A|140| A: plus [i] guess [if _they] are_ [in] [problem] enough _to be_ jailed [or something] [of that] nature [for] any length [of] [time] [then] [the company] [has] lost [what] they've put into [that] employee [and] [their] expertise _or whatever ._ 
B|141| B: [i'm] sorry [for] these beeps 
A|142| A: _well we_ [were] [there] [in the] winter . [in uh] january [or] february [i don't] remember [which] 
B|143| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|144| A: [yeah [.] [but] [i] think] [it's] [about] [an] hour . 
B|145| B: [you know it's] [kind _of] a_ give [and] take [kind _of] thing_ [i think] . 
A|146| A: [and [uh] i] [thought] austin [was] beautiful 
B|147| B: [i'm] _sure_ [that's coming] [though [.] but] [they are] wonderful _kids_ . 
A|148| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|149| B: [uh] [so] [they] [they] [uh] [don't] [have] [too] _many_ facilities [it] seems [for] [their] personal items . [very] limited space waste 
A|150| A: [and i] love [to] walk [so] [if] [i have] [a] lunch hour [with] [nice] weather [i] [get] _out_ [and and] walk . [what] [about] [you] ? 
B|151| B: [what] [uh] grade [is] [your] [daughter] [in] ? 
A|152| A: [yeah .] 
B|153| B: [oh] [uh-huh] [yeah] [and] sometimes [the] [the] local ones aren't [as] publicized [it] seems [that uh] [they] should [be] . 
A|154| A: [yeah .] 
B|155| B: _oh ._ [okay] [well we] [uh] [are] [a] group [of] [uh] musicians [that] [just] [kind of] [have [you] know] formed [out _of] a_ desire [to] sing [and] _many_ [of the] [people] [in the] group [are] [very] professional [in the] sense _that they_ [or] [just] real talented [i] should [say] . 
A|156| A: [so] [we're] [just] starting into hunting [for] child _care_ . 
B|157| B: [oh [okay] .] 
A|158| A: [okay .] [that] keeps [you] [do you] [have] [a lot of] activities [with] [your] [kids] ? 
B|159| B: huh . 
A|160| A: [that is] odd [. [i] was] drug tested [uh] [not] [for the] job [i have] [now] [but] [for the] prior job [uh] [but [i] know] [that they] [sent] [that] [the] job [i had] before [that] [well] [the] job [i have] [have] [now] requested [my] [uh] [uh] [my] [uh] _medical_ record [from] [my] old [company] 
B|161| B: [and she] [works] [uh] [as] [a] assistant manager [in] [a] fabric store . 
A|162| A: [okay .] 
B|163| B: [but] [some] [of] these [guys] [just] [don't] [care] [you know [.] _and] so_ [uh] 
A|164| A: _it wasn't_ [too] much [of a] job [really] . 
B|165| B: [right] 
A|166| A: [and] [that is] [true] [in] [many] [many] areas [of] [you know] [uh] job titles [and] professions . 
B|167| B: huh . 
A|168| A: [oh .] 
B|169| B: [i think] [you just] [have to] drop [in] [all] unexpectedly [a lot] . 
A|170| A: [right .] [right] [well i] guess [that's] [a] [good] point [uh] 
B|171| B: [they] almost always [get] thrown [right] back [out] again [but] [they] [have [to] have] [every] single [appeal] made open [to] [them] . 
A|172| A: [um] [um] [but] [it] [just] [work] [in the] garden [work] [around the] yard [of] course 
B|173| B: italian food 
A|174| A: [do you] [all] [uh] [have] [a] budget ? 
B|175| B: [yeah .] 
A|176| A: _but you know [for_ the] most [part] gardening [for] [us] [is] [well we] [got] asparagus [and uh] [we've] [got] [some] plum trees [and some] apple trees [and some] tomato [and some] blackberries [and] [strawberries] . 
B|177| B: [are] [you] serious ? 
A|178| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|179| B: [and i] [i] certainly [i] [i] grew [up in] [a] smaller town [in] [texas] [and] [it wasn't] [that] [way] [when] [i was] younger . 
A|180| A: great nancy . 
B|181| B: wow . 
A|182| A: [yeah i] [i've heard] [a lot of [people] say] [that .] [that's] [for] [sure] [. uh] [we have] [an] attic [that] [we've] [just] put [you know] plywood over [the] beams [and] [things] [up [in] the] attic [and so] [that] [has] replaced [it] [to some] extent 
B|183| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|184| A: [right] [and] [people] [don't] see [that] either . 
B|185| B: [uh] . 
A|186| A: [yeah] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|187| B: [okay .] 
A|188| A: [right] 
B|189| B: [i don't] want [to be] running [down] [there] [every] week [or whatever .] 
A|190| A: _no_ [not] [really] . [i'm] [not] [that] [up] [be] [on] [that] [sort [of] [thing] .] 
B|191| B: [oh] [no .]
