A|0| A: _up_ until _, like_ , eighty-five _or something_ _was_ _the ,_ 
B|1| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: _what_ _do you_ _use_ _it_ _for_ ? 
B|3| B: _yeah _._ uh [,_ like] september [was] hot _and_ dry , october . 
A|4| A: _that _,_ that_ _kind of_ gripes _on_ _me_ _some_ _, _but_ _,_ but _i_ don't _know_ ._ 
B|5| B: _yeah ._ 
A|6| A: _oh _,_ is that_ _right_ ? 
B|7| B: [do you] want _to hear_ _about_ _my_ other animals _i've_ _had_ ? 
A|8| A: _oh , now_ come _on ,_ _no_ _texas_ rangers ? 
B|9| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [yeah .] 
B|11| B: _yeah ,_ yep , 
A|12| A: _oh _,_ they_ _do _,_ too_ _. and_ _they're_ impossible [to] crush _. i mean_ _, you_ can't _get_ _the_ _down_ [to] any _size_ _, you know ._ _if_ [you] _get_ four milk cartons [and] _that_ fills _up_ trash bag _, you know_ _pretty_ easily , _so_ _. you know ,_ 
B|13| B: _right ._ 
A|14| A: _i don't know_ _how_ americans _are_ [about] handguns _but _,_ uh ,_ yesterday _a_ lady _i_ _work_ _with_ _just_ told _me_ today _that , uh _,_ _in_ the_ state capitol _here_ _in_ austin , _texas _,_ _they_ had_ _been_ _, uh ,_ looking _at_ _a_ bill _, uh ,_ making _it_ easier [to] accept _the_ bill [to] access _, to_ access handguns [and] _they_ passed _it ,_ _which_ basically means without _an_ f b _i_ check any person _here_ _in_ _this_ state over twenty-one _can_ _get_ _a_ gun 
B|15| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: _i think_ _he's_ dead _now_ _, but_ he plays wonderfully . 
B|17| B: [but _i] _,_ i_ usually [just] read through [the] sections [on ,] [on] domestic _stuff ._ 
A|18| A: [and] _they_ _say_ _it's_ _going to_ last [about] _two_ [to] _three_ weeks _. and_ _this_ _guy_ _in_ front _of_ _me_ _said_ [, i] can't believe _i was_ summonsed _. _i_ was_ _an_ investigator _and _i_ was_ tailing [the] woman _that_ [was] killed . _well ,_ _then_ _i have_ _a_ friend _at_ _school_ _that_ _has_ _a_ boyfriend _that's_ _a_ lawyer [and] he _said_ _that_ _this_ woman _this_ socialite _in_ plano [had] hired four _guys_ [to] kill _her_ husband _and the_ _one_ _that's_ accused [was] [the] _one_ _that_ _actually_ _did_ _it _._ _and_ she_ _has_ since taken _off_ _with_ _another_ lawyer who [had] _been_ _, uh ,_ getting cocaine _from_ his client [and] _then_ selling _it _,_ and_ he [had] skipped bail [and] _they_ finally extradited him [and] _he's_ _going to_ testify _for the_ state against _her_ _so_ he'll _have_ his sentence reduced . 
B|19| B: [you know ,] _there's_ nothing [in] _there_ _that can_ wrap _around [the_ _,] [the_ [,] uh ,] rollers [or] _anything_ . [it] seems [like] [a] _really_ _good_ answer [to] portable music [, that] [you] [can] choose . 
A|20| A: [yeah .] 
B|21| B: _we're_ [in] sherman . 
A|22| A: _oh _,_ [yeah_ .] 
B|23| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|24| A: _yes_ . 
B|25| B: [uh _,] the_ nissan came _and , and_ _we_ bought [the] nissan [for] functional purposes _not_ [what] [the] consumer reports [said] _we_ should [get] . 
A|26| A: [yeah .] 
B|27| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: [you know] once [you] make [that] step [you know] [that] _it's_ [just] _going _to_ be_ downhill _from_ _then_ [on] [and , and] _i've seen_ _people_ [really] fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to] make [the] _change_ . 
B|29| B: _oh ._ 
A|30| A: [and] _then_ _those_ convicted , especially _of _,_ you know ,_ murder _and _, and ,_ uh _,_ you know ,_ major crimes [, _uh ,] to_ reach [the] life sentences [and _,] you know ,_ death penalties [and] follow-through _with_ _that ._ 
B|31| B: _yeah ,_ [she] only taught _there_ [one] year [but _i] ,_ 
A|32| A: _no_ _, i have_ _no_ _idea_ _. _i_ don't_ _think , _i_ don't_ _think that_ [was] _on a_ b c , anyway _i don't know_ [what] happened [to] [it] _though ._ 
B|33| B: [yes] [, i] understand . 
A|34| A: _well ,_ listen _, uh _, i_ think_ _i've , i've_ exhausted _my [,_ uh ,] self [on ,] _at_ least [i've] blown _off_ steam _of the_ _way_ [i] feel [about] _it ._ 
B|35| B: [uh ,] almost [an] addition _, uh [, [and_ ,] [and ,] and] _we_ could equate [or] relate relay [well] _to some_ [of the] newspaper [and] television articles [about] [the] fact [that] [people] _where_ _having_ [this] _problem_ _in , in_ unhooking , uncoupling _from the_ events [, and] [going] [on] [with] _their_ _. _so_ ,_ 
A|36| A: [so _,] _well ,_ _i_ don't know_ _that's_ _my ,_ [my] great _hard_ recipe . 
B|37| B: _yeah ,_ [he's] _a pretty_ _nice_ [guy] . 
A|38| A: _how_ _would_ [you] _go about_ organizing [a] _family_ reunion ? 
B|39| B: _um_ . 
A|40| A: [yeah .] 
B|41| B: _you're_ [going _to] have_ [on] extra expenses [for] car . 
A|42| A: [yeah .] _yeah _, _i_ think ,_ _i_ mean_ _that's_ _pretty _,_ that's_ [a pretty] _important_ [, uh _,] part_ [of] [it] [there] _because_ _that [,_ [that] can] _be_ [really] expensive _if_ [you] ever [have] any health _problems_ . [my] dad _, i think_ _my _,_ i'm_ still covered [on ,] [with] [my] dad's [, uh ,] health plan _at_ his , [where] he _works _,_ but_ _it would_ definitely _be_ _something_ [to] look into once [i] [get] [my] own . 
B|43| B: [and] _a lot of_ _them_ decide [just] _not _to_ have_ _children_ . 
A|44| A: _okay ,_ [have] [you] participated [in] [anything] _like that_ ? 
B|45| B: _uh-huh_ [yeah _, i] really_ [do _,] because_ [i] [like] _to get_ [, you know ,] [get] [off] alone [and] [just] _do that_ [for] [a] while [, but] [that's] [hard] [, you know .] 
A|46| A: _you know , it's_ [just] _, but it's_ frightening [to] _us_ [because] [we] live [pretty] far [from] _her_ . she's _down_ [in] temple 
B|47| B: [uh] ... 
A|48| A: _it's_ gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . [the] coastline [was] [just] incredible . _it's_ huge . 
B|49| B: wow . 
A|50| A: _i was_ _a ,_ student [there] [and] spent _, um _,_ a_ semester studying abroad [in] london . 
B|51| B: _uh-huh ._ ooh . _uh-huh ._ _uh-huh ._ 
A|52| A: [so] _it was_ [pretty] much [a] physical decision ? 
B|53| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|54| A: [good] point . [that's] [a] [good] point . 
B|55| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|56| A: _that's coming_ _up_ _here_ [pretty] soon . _is_ [it] [this] weekend ? 
B|57| B: [i] _got_ [my] certification _. but_ [actually] [they] [did] _not_ _teach_ [us] _very_ _many_ _things_ [about] [how] [really] [to] [go about] helping [people] [to] learn [another] language 
A|58| A: [so _,] [do_ you] _think _,_ _it_ was_ overdeveloped _then_ ? 
B|59| B: _uh-huh ._ 
A|60| A: [right .] [yeah .] 
B|61| B: [and] _all_ _of a_ sudden _you've got to_ [do] [something] _else_ . 
A|62| A: [oh] man . 
B|63| B: [i mean] _as_ _you're_ walking through [that] _little_ tour _in [,_ uh ,] munich [, it's] [kind of] [they're] trying [to] brainwash [you] [, too] 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: _i've heard_ [too] _many_ _people _say_ [,_ i] hate [it] [here] . 
A|66| A: [yeah , i] [heard] _that ._ _it's [,_ it's] _daughter_ [, it's] his _daughter_ _that ,_ 
B|67| B: t- , _whether_ [my] dentist [or] 
A|68| A: [yeah .] 
B|69| B: [and the] garages _were_ always _, if_ [the] house [was] large [, it] seemed [like] [the] garages _were_ small even _if they_ _were_ [three] car garages [which] [is] [what] _we _have_ ._ 
A|70| A: dye mound ? 
B|71| B: [the] whole [family] [was] [so] disappointed 
A|72| A: [and] _when_ [you're] [as] busy [as] _one of_ _those_ babies , [you've got to] eat most [of _the] _time_ ._ 
B|73| B: [and , uh [,] that's] _more_ [important] _than_ [anything] _else_ . [we] could [have] _sent [,_ uh ,] [her] [to] [a] fancier [, uh ,] facility . 
A|74| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [and] [it's] [like] [i] [said] [at] _our_ expense . 
A|76| A: _but then_ [it] _depends on_ who [you] _are_ calling [on] . who [you're] [, you] [like] _your_ minister standing _up in_ front [of] [you] [with] _no_ tie [, _you] just_ [, uh ,] he _would_ _be_ missing [something] . 
B|77| B: _oh , i_ . 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| B: [yeah .] 
A|80| A: [and the] neighborhoods _are_ stable [you know .] 
B|81| B: _oh _, i_ [know_ .] 
A|82| A: [right .] 
B|83| B: [yeah .] 
A|84| A: [right .] 
B|85| B: [well _, i] [,_ i] collect antique tools [, uh _,] for_ [one] _thing_ [, i] [well [,] i'm] _sort of_ [in] [an] antique business [, but it's] _a little_ sideline [, part] [time] _thing ._ 
A|86| A: [and _, uh ,] _i_ was_ [kind of] _interested_ [to hear] cause _they had_ [some] [people] [from the] e p [a] [and] lots [of] different places 
B|87| B: [but] [that] _same_ house [here] , you'd pay almost six thousand _dollars_ [a] year , taxes [on] [it .] 
A|88| A: [i ,] 
B|89| B: [and] [you] [can] give [me] eighties 
A|90| A: huh-uh . 
B|91| B: [well [,] you know [,] but] [you] made [the] comment earlier , why [would] someone [be] [interested] [in] _children_ [. i mean] [it] [has] _been a_ real [, uh ,] [there] _have been_ [some] [good] entrepreneurial type experiences [. [and] [i] think [, i] think] [they] [have] captured [a] certain market . again [the [,] [but] then] [there] [are] baby-sitting groups . [as] [a] pediatrician , [one [of] the] _things_ _we've_ [been] real concerned [about] [is] [the] infections . 
A|92| A: [and i] _thought_ [, you know [,] that] _really _,_ now_ [that] [i'm] thirty _years_ old [, _i think] that_ [one] [or] _two_ _years_ _out _of_ my_ life [would] _have ,_ _probably_ [like] [you] [said] _, _to_ be_ able [to] travel [some] place [else] [whether] [it] [be] [the] united states [or] outside _the country [,_ _i think] _it_ would_ [have [been] a] [very] [good] _, um ,_ experience [for] [me] . 
B|93| B: [and _i] know_ _a lot of people_ [it would] , [would] solve [the] convenience _problem_ _if [they_ had] curbside pickup _and some_ communities [are] trying [to] _do that_ [now] [. [and] [i] think that] maybe _if they_ only charged [for the] garbage [that] [you] [did] _not_ _sort_ [and] [have] set [up] [for] recycling , 
A|94| A: [i] [did] [a lot of] [just] [going] _out_ by myself [and] riding _on the_ subway [and] watching [people] . 
B|95| B: [i don't know] [yeah] [i think [it] was] . 
A|96| A: [yeah .] [yeah ,] [you're] _probably_ _right ,_ _two_ _years_ might [be] [a little] [too] long . 
B|97| B: [right .] [there] [for] [a] while [, that] [would] [, that] _worked_ . _we've_ [, uh _, i] know_ _i have [,_ um ,] i'll stick [to] [uh , to] [the [,] you know ,] sometimes i'll stick [to] [a] certain party , [depends [on] the] [guy] . 
A|98| A: [and [, uh ,] and] [on] huge doses [of] antibiotics [, and] he [actually] [got] over [it] [with] , seven hundred [dollars] [in] vet bills , 
B|99| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: _okay ._ 
B|101| B: _i really_ [like] [those] [, in] fact [, _i] had_ [a] harpsichord played [at] [my] wedding . 
A|102| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [that's] [right .] [if] [i have] [a] [problem] discipline [, you know _,] i think _,_ now_ , boy [, i really] need [to get] _out_ [, you know [,] and] apply _something [,_ you know [,] [and] i] screw [around] [and] [don't] [do] _it or_ wait [too] long _or something_ . 
B|105| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [well [,] that's] [a] full [time] job . 
B|107| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [oh ,] [really] . 
B|109| B: [oh [,] do] [they] ? 
A|110| A: [oh [, _i] think] that's_ great . 
B|111| B: [oh , now] [that's] neat . 
A|112| A: [but i] find [that] _when_ [you] [do _that] [,_ you] [do] [more] chatting [than] [you] [do] exercise 
B|113| B: [well _, i] know_ [it's] [hard] [for] young [people] [to] [think] [about] giving [up] _their_ [years] [, you know ,] _their_ carefree [years] 
A|114| A: [yeah .] 
B|115| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|116| A: _right ,_ _right _,_ that's [,_ uh ,] 
B|117| B: [right .] [then] [you] [can] [just] _sort of_ [have] pictures [to] [go] along [with] [it [or] [something] _,] because_ [really [,] i've] [thought] lately , _there's_ nothing new [in [the] time] magazine . 
A|118| A: everyone [would] _appeal_ . _that's true_ [, too] . 
B|119| B: [is [that] [,] is that] [good] ? [you know [,] [i've] seen] [that] [so] _many_ times , _strawberries_ dipped [in] chocolate [but] [i've] _never_ tried [it ,] [are] [they] [really] [good] ? 
A|120| A: [it] [is] [, because] _they ,_ 
B|121| B: [i think that's] [one] reason _we have_ [problems] [in] schools [, uh , _and] some_ [of] _them_ [are] _our_ [problems] [, but] [a lot of] [it's] [because] _everything_ society wants _, we_ [are] supposed [to] [do] . 
A|122| A: [i think that] once [you] [do [that] ,] _your_ [children] [kind of] develop [the] [same] attitudes . [at] least [my] daughters [have .] [they] try [to] [teach] theirs [not [to] get] into [things] instead [of] [having] [to] put [everything] [up] [. _so] it's_ [worked] [pretty] [well] . [there's] [, [i] don't] [really] [think] anything's [been] broken . _every_ [now] [and] [then] [we _have] to_ [kind of] [go] [and] [say [,] now] [don't] bother [this] [you know .] 
B|123| B: [i] always , take home baked bread . 
A|124| A: aids research [is] [something] [that _,] that [,_ i think] [whether] [our] _country_ [is] putting enough money into [it] 
B|125| B: [so _,] we_ _, we_ rely [pretty ,] [pretty] heavily [, i think ,] [on a] combination [of [the] _,] [of_ the] [two] [. i] also [, uh ,] [use] [, uh ,] newsweek magazine _. uh ,_ 
A|126| A: [so] [we] [never] [really] spent [that] much [time] [at] [the] campground [as] much [as] [we] [did] , 
B|127| B: [uh-huh .] [uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: makes [a lot of] difference . 
B|129| B: [yeah [,] [i've] _, i've] heard_ _of [that_ .] 
A|130| A: _oh , _okay_ [,_ i know] [where] [that] [is] . 
B|131| B: [and] does _the company_ pay [for] [it [.] you know _,] all_ [or] partially [or] [how] does [that] [work] . 
A|132| A: [yes] . [my] son [, is] [in] both band [and] scouts [too] . 
B|133| B: [i] rely primarily [on [,] uh ,] newspaper combined [with] television . 
A|134| A: _no ._ 
B|135| B: [well [, i] have] [seen] [a] big [change] [, i think [,] in] high [school] _kids_ [that] [my] relatives [and] friends [, that [,] um [,] i know] [when] [i was] [in] high [school] _i had_ [an] [idea] [of] [what] [i really] wanted [to] [do] [with] [what] [my ,] [what] [i was] [going to] study 
A|136| A: [oh _,] yeah [,_ all] [that] hoedown [stuff .] 
B|137| B: [it's [,] [you know ,] it's] [a] game [to] [her] [, but [i] [,] i] [do] [not] [like] [to] [do that] [i] consider [it] [kind _of] [a_ [,] a] waste [of my] [time [.] _and] so_ [i'm] usually [, uh ,] [pretty] careful [when] [i] shop 
A|138| A: [you know , [it's] [,] i think] [it's] [very] difficult [in the] first place [to] make [that] choice [to have] [them] [go] [there] . 
B|139| B: [yeah [,] [that's] true] . 
A|140| A: plus [, i] guess [, [if] _they] are_ [in] [problem] enough _to be_ jailed [or something] [of that] nature [for] any length [of] [time] , [then] [the company] [has] lost [what] they've put into [that] employee [, and] [their] expertise _or whatever ._ 
B|141| B: [i'm] sorry [for] these beeps , 
A|142| A: [well] [we] [were] [there] [in the] winter . [in] [uh ,] january [or] february [, [i] don't] remember [which] , 
B|143| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|144| A: [yeah _.] but [,_ i think] [it's] [about] [an] hour . 
B|145| B: [you know , it's] [kind _of] a_ give [and] take [kind _of] thing_ [, i think] . 
A|146| A: [and [, uh ,] i] [thought] austin [was] beautiful 
B|147| B: [i'm] _sure_ [that's coming] [though [.] but [,] [they] are] wonderful _kids_ . 
A|148| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|149| B: [uh] [so [,] [they] [,] [they] [,] uh ,] [don't] [have] [too] _many_ facilities [it] seems [for] [their] personal items . [very] limited space waste 
A|150| A: [and i] love [to] walk , [so] [if] [i have] [a] lunch hour [with] [nice] weather [i] [get] _out_ [and , and] walk . [what] [about] [you] ? 
B|151| B: [what] [, uh ,] grade [is] [your] [daughter] [in] ? 
A|152| A: [yeah .] 
B|153| B: [oh ,] [uh-huh] [, yeah [,] and] sometimes [the _,] the_ local ones aren't [as] publicized [it] seems [that , uh [,] they] should [be] . 
A|154| A: [yeah .] 
B|155| B: _oh ._ [okay _,] well , we_ [, uh ,] [are] [a] group [of [,] uh ,] musicians [that] [just] [kind of] [have [,] you know ,] formed [out _of] a_ desire [to] sing [and] _many_ [of the] [people] [in the] group [are] [very] professional [in the] sense _that [they_ ,] [or] [just] real talented [i] should [say] . 
A|156| A: [so ,] [we're] [just] starting into hunting [for] child _care_ . 
B|157| B: [oh , [okay] .] 
A|158| A: [okay .] [that] keeps [you] [do you] [have] [a lot of] activities [with] [your] [kids] ? 
B|159| B: huh . 
A|160| A: [that] [is] odd [. [i] was] drug tested [, uh ,] [not] [for the] job [i have] [now] [, but] [for the] prior job [, uh [,] but [i] know] [that they] [sent [,] that] [the] job [i had] before [, that [,] well [,] the] job [i have ,] [have] [now] , requested [my [,] uh [,] uh ,] [my [,] uh ,] _medical_ record [from] [my] old [company] 
B|161| B: [and she] [works [,] uh ,] [as] [a] assistant manager [in] [a] fabric store . 
A|162| A: [okay .] 
B|163| B: [but] [some] [of] these [guys] [just] [don't] [care] [, you know [.] _and] [so_ [,] uh ,] 
A|164| A: _it wasn't_ [too] much [of a] job , [really] . 
B|165| B: [right ,] 
A|166| A: [and] [that] [is] [true] [in] [many] , [many] areas [of [,] you know [,] uh ,] job titles [and] professions . 
B|167| B: huh . 
A|168| A: [oh .] 
B|169| B: [i think] [you just] [have to] drop [in] [all] unexpectedly [a lot] . 
A|170| A: [right .] [right [,] well] [i] guess [that's] [a] [good] point [, uh ,] 
B|171| B: [they] almost always [get] thrown [right] back [out] again [, but] [they] [have [to] have] [every] single [appeal] made open [to] [them] . 
A|172| A: [um [,] um [,] but] [it] [just] , [work] [in the] garden , [work] [around the] yard [, of] course ,

A|174| A: [do you] [all] [, uh ,] [have] [a] budget ? 
B|175| B: [yeah .]

B|177| B: [are] [you] serious ? 
A|178| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|179| B: [and [i] [,] i] certainly _, i [,_ i] grew [up in] [a] smaller town [in] [texas [,] and] [it wasn't] [that] [way] [when] [i was] younger . 
A|180| A: great , nancy .

B|183| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|184| A: [right [,] and] [people] [don't] see [that] either .
