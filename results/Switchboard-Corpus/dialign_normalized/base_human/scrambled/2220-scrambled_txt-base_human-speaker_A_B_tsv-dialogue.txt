B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [well [,] i] agree , absolutely [, _and] [you_ know [,] it's] [all] relative [, because] [i was] [from] west texas [, and] [it] [was] very [dry] [, and] [so] [i] thought dallas [was] awful [, and i] still [think] [so [,] but] [then] _this_ summer [we] went [to] orlando [for a week , and] [it] [was] [so] humid [there] [that] [your] [, um [,] all] [your] windows were were wet [every] morning .
