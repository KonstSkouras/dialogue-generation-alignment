A|110| A: [that's] funny . where [is] [he] [from] [in] france ? [uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [of] course _they had [to_ be] [be] [uh] grown [in] greenhouses [and] stuff [and] [in]

B|113| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [well] [i] agree absolutely _and [you_ know] [it's] [all] relative [because] [i was] [from] west texas [and] [it] [was] very [dry and] [so i] thought dallas [was] awful [and i] still [think] [so] [but] [then] _this_ summer [we] went [to] orlando [for a week and] [it] [was] [so] humid [there] [that] [your] [um] [all] [your] windows were were wet [every] morning .

A|120| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|121| B: [yeah [i] i] [yeah [i] [i] i] truly believe [that] [that] before [that] [that [we] have] [to] address [the] racial racial issues [in the] united states before [we] [can go] anywhere . 
A|122| A: [but] [i think] [that] might [be] [a] violation [of] someone's rights . [if] someone's having personal problems [for some] reason [that's] causing [them] [to] behave differently
