A|2| A: _yeah ._ 
B|3| B: _good ._ _there's_ nothing wrong _with_ _that ._ _actually_ _i think_ probably _if_ _i_ _were_ _going_ [to] _get_ _if_ _i_ _were_ _going_ _to be_ practical _which_ doesn't _mean_ _i_ _would_ _be_ _i_ _would_ prefer white . _because_ simply _because_ _it's_ _more_ visible _at_ _night_ . 
A|4| A: _oh_ maybe _my_ dropping _my_ phone . _is_ [that] _better_ ? 
B|5| B: _i really_ [do] _. i think_ it'd _be_ [better] _that way_ _and_ _even_ _at that_ _it would_ _at least_ _give_ _the_ _person_ _time_ [to] look _for_ another job _because_ _they_ _know_ _that that_ _there_ _are_ problems 
A|6| A: _uh-huh _._ yeah ._

A|12| A: _when_ [was] [that] _on_ ? 
B|13| B: _oh ._ _oh that's nice_ _i_ _this_ [is] _different_ _for_ us _because_ _the_ other _in the_ past _we've_ _had_ homes [that] _haven't had_ _any_ side walks _and_ _um_ _it's been_ _a_ little _more_ country _with_ _the_ trees _and_ _we_ [do] miss _that ._ _um_ _if_ _we_ _had a_ chance [to] move _i think_ we'd move _back_ [to] somewhere _that _was_ a_ little _more_ countrified _and a_ little less maintenance required _as_ _as_ _far_ _as_ [that] goes . 
A|14| A: _and [i_ was] [going] through [a] divorce _and i_ _just_ found [that] running [really] made me feel [good .] 
B|15| B: _no _i_ don't_ _think_ _so_ either _because_ [a] _lot of_ _people_ _um_ depending [on] how _the_ public _service_ programs _are_ set up [and] _i'm _not_ that_ _familiar with them_ [to] _know_ 
A|16| A: hello lynn . 
B|17| B: [and] _you're_ _in_ minneapolis 
A|18| A: _yeah ._ _i've_ _heard_ _of a_ couple [of] companies [that] [have] done [that [.] i think] [uh] [back] _about_ [a] few years ago _when_ _things_ [were] _tough_ hewlett-packard did [that] _for awhile_ . [they] went _to a_ [uh] [a] _a _four_ [and_ a] _half_ day work week rather _than_ cut [yeah] _just_ cut _everybody_ [back] ten percent _. _and_ uh_ _have to_ [give] _everybody_ [a] _half_ day [a] week _off ._ 
B|19| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|20| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: _but_ _they do_ [have] socialized medicine [and] [things] [like] [that .] 
A|22| A: [oh .] 
B|23| B: [my] oldest [is] [uh] [four and] [my] youngest [is] [about] [to] turn _three_ . _two_ girls [. _and] they_ _are_ [a] handful 
A|24| A: _yeah ._ 
B|25| B: last _year_ _it was_ d _c_ _i guess_ baltimore caught _them ._ 
A|26| A: [really] . 
B|27| B: _wow_ . 
A|28| A: [but] _i _i_ don't know the_ performance [of] _it ._ _that's a_ ford product 
B|29| B: [and] _so i_ decided _well_ _if_ she's [going] [to] [do] [that] _it would_ _be_ [a] whole _lot_ easier _if_ _she_ could type 
A|30| A: [yeah] 
B|31| B: [and i] [do] [like] _them [._ and] i'd [like _to] _have_ a_ compact disc player _in the_ car . [that] _would_ _be_ _something_ [that] [i] _would_ [really] [like] . 
A|32| A: ooh _yes [._ and] [your] _kids_ _all_ ski ? 
B|33| B: [yeah .] 
A|34| A: [it's] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [. _you] know_ _all_ these [things] [. _i] mean _you_ know_ [we've] gone through [this] over [and] over again . 
B|35| B: [but] [that's] _because_ [it's] _so_ _old_ . 
A|36| A: _well _i_ haven't had_ _an_ awful [lot of] [uh] incidents regarding child _care_ . _when_ [my] [two] [year] [old] [was] [in] new orleans [she] _got_ bit _on the_ cheek _and uh_ _but uh_ [that's] [about] [the] [the] [uh] [the] extent [of] _it ._ [but] [but] [but] _when_ [i really] am am concerned [about] [is] [that] [uh] [so] many [of] these child _care_ _places_ [are] [are] coming under [uh] _uh you know_ investigation _for for_ _uh you know_ child molestation . 
B|37| B: [really] ? 
A|38| A: [yeah] _that's a good idea ._ 
B|39| B: [yeah] east _texas is_ recruiting [for] [you know] their fall semester 
A|40| A: [uh] [they] _sure_ [are] _just_ [because] _some_ innocent [person] can [really] 
B|41| B: [oh] [uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [and] [no] [two] [of] [them] [are] alike [and] 
B|43| B: _right ._ 
A|44| A: [oh] _sure_ [because] [if] [you] take [it] into [a] [service] station [they] _want to_ charge [you] forty dollars _just_ [for] [uh] freon [which] _only_ costs [you] [about] [three] dollars 
B|45| B: [yeah] _what_ [you] see shown [and] bred _now_ _as_ golden retrievers [this] [you know] plus eighty [to a] hundred pound range . 
A|46| A: [well] [yeah] [it's] _uh it's_ _uh it's_ [uh] [there's] [uh] [there's] pluses [to] everything 
B|47| B: [that's] great . 
A|48| A: [oh that's nice] . 
B|49| B: _um_ _most of the_ lawyer programs [like] [uh] law [and] order _they're_ _not_ [on _the] times_ [that] _i've got_ [that] [i've] watched [because] [i haven't had] t [got] t v _guide_ around _here_ [in] ages . 
A|50| A: [i think] [it's] [because] he's _always_ _heard_ music _in our_ _home_ _all the_ since _he [was_ a] baby . 
B|51| B: _right ._ [oh] [it's] [tough] _i'm_ [sure] . 
A|52| A: next _thing_ [you know] you've [got] him . 
B|53| B: [but] _what_ [are] [you] _supposed to_ [do] _with them ._ [oh] _okay ._ 
A|54| A: watch me . 
B|55| B: _uh-huh . uh-huh ._ 
A|56| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [i think] those ought _to be_ punished [a] whole [lot] worse [than] [they] [are] . 
A|58| A: [uh-huh] [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [and i] _retired_ [about] five years ago [and] started college .

A|62| A: [right [.] uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [yeah .] 
A|64| A: [but] _before_ [that] [for] [most of the] [year] [it's been] hot [and] dry . 
B|65| B: [if] [it] rained _we_ [were] stuck _back in_ _there ._ _had [a_ four] wheel drive . 
A|66| A: [so] [you're] [you're] [not that] [far] north _then_ [okay .] 
B|67| B: _i know ._ 
A|68| A: [right .] 
B|69| B: [well] [the] german shepherd [that] [i] [had] [before] _we_ _we_ _had a_ little pool 
A|70| A: [you] hate [to have] [the] dubious honor [of] _being_ [you know] [so] high [in the] [in] statistics 
B|71| B: [but] washington's [a] great place [to] [do] [that .] 
A|72| A: _yes_ [yeah] 
B|73| B: [so] [he] could afford [to] _get_ _married_ [but] [is] [not] engaged _yet_ 
A|74| A: _so [i've_ got] [a] [pretty] [good] grade [there .] 
B|75| B: [that] [i] [had] [heard] _that _that_ was_ [better] . _that [was_ a] [better] one . 
A|76| A: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] [right] [any] [on the] street [no [i] know [.] uh-huh _.] yeah_ [and] [texas is] having [a] problem [right] [now] [and] [it's] [the] [the] [the] [the] [the] [i think] [that's] [the] [the] repeat crimes _and the_ repeat offenders [is] happening down [here] _where_ [they're] [they're] patrol [the] state patrol board [is] letting [people] _walk_ [that] [have] done [oh] heinous [things] from from killing police officers [to] _i mean_ _just_ multiple [you know] molestations [to] murders [of] children _just_ [you know] [really] _bad_ [things] [and] [they're] [get] these [people] [are] [getting] _out_ [like] [three] [to] five years [before] [they're] [even] suppose [to be] considered 
B|77| B: [uh-huh .] [yes .] 
A|78| A: forty-eight . _that's a_ long [time] _. _uh_ ._ 
B|79| B: [you [know] the] views [and [uh] you know] [everybody] gets [to] vote [on] [you know] [well] should [he] [be] [for] [this] [and] [on] [and] [on] [and] [on] [and [uh] it's] [it's] _interesting_ . 
A|80| A: [as] [a] matter [of] fact [if] [i'm] injured _or_ [have] _an_ emergency _when_ [i'm] say [in] germany _or_ france [uh] [that] [i'm] automatically taken _care_ [of] 
B|81| B: [yeah] [i mean] [there] _would_ [be] loopholes [just] [like] [there] [is] [in] anything else 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] born [and] raised texan _huh ._ 
B|83| B: [and _i] think that_ _would_ [be] wonderful _too ._ 
A|84| A: [it's] [at [that] was] [actually] [a] big dilemma [for] me [now] [because] [um] cheers cheers [and] twin peaks [are] [now] [on _the] same_ [time] 
B|85| B: [i] can't believe [that] [i] [i'm] [just] thankful [that] [i don't] [get] [all the] government [that] [i] pay [for] . 
A|86| A: did [he] did [he] [actually] play [in the] pro bowl [. i] remember _he was_ [like] [a] backup _and then_ somebody [got] injured [and] _he was_ [supposed to] go . 
B|87| B: [yeah] _i _have_ a_ garden [but] [you know] _we _have_ a_ garden . 
A|88| A: [yeah .] 
B|89| B: [and] everyone [always] asked [if] [the] girl [got] spoiled . 
A|90| A: [yeah] [so] twin peaks [um] [what] happened [was] [i think] twin peaks [um] went went _off_ [they] moved [to a] saturday [night] [for] [a] while _. and then_ put _and then_ put [something] [i guess] gabriel's fire [on] [it] [and] [at] thursday nights _and then_ [they] moved [um] [no] gabriel's fire [was] [on] [c] b s [i think] _i i_ take [that] [back] [. [i'm] not] [sure] [but] _anyway_ [they] moved [it] [back] [and] forth [and] [that's] _when_ peaks [was] [back in] [that] [time] slot [as] [well] _. [so_ _i] don't [know_ .] 
B|91| B: [yeah] [yeah] [but [uh] it's] [just] [it's] [just] [something] [that] [you know] [my] theory [is] [you know] [when] [when] [you] [have] [kids] [and] [all] [you] [you] [want to] [do] [well] [what] i'll _do is_ [you know] [like] [i mean you] might [have] problems [but] [it's] [not] [your] kids' problems [you know] 
A|92| A: _we have with_ aetna [and uh] _i don't know_ [if] [you're] [familiar with them] [but] we're _real_ happy [with them .] 
B|93| B: [when] [he] [retired] ? 
A|94| A: [wow] 
B|95| B: [that's a good idea .] 
A|96| A: [oh] [i] never [heard] [of] [that .] 
B|97| B: [yes .] 
A|98| A: [at] [at] excuse me [at] [what] age did [you] [oh that's] [too] _bad_ [because] 
B|99| B: [um] [all] [of] his direct descendants descendants [have] [now] died [and the] grandchildren [are] [in] their seventies [and] eighties . 
A|100| A: [well] [don't] [they] take [people] who _have some_ _sort of_ [um] big abilities [like] _and and_ [at least] [they] used [to] [when] [it] [when] [it] [the] first ones [i] saw [they] [had] [um] [a] man [on] who [was] [uh] [he] played college football [and] _almost_ went pro [and they] [had a] [a] woman who [was a] black belt [in] karate [and] [she] [was] [the] [uh] [she] [was] [in the] junior olympics _or_ [something] _or_ [they] seem [to have] [people] who [have] _very very_ big sports backgrounds . [to have] [they] leaned away from _that sort of_ 
B|101| B: [but] [oh] gosh [i] can't [even] [walk] _by_ central park [yeah] [when] summertime [just] [the] smell [is] [so] [bad] [of the] horses . 
A|102| A: _yeah . yeah ._ 
B|103| B: [well i] understand [that] [you [know] .] [if] needs [and] wants [were] [the same] i'd _have [a_ four] eighty-six machine [at] [home] 
A|104| A: [well [i] think] [that's] [all] [i _have] to_ say . 
B|105| B: [right [.] yeah .] 
A|106| A: [oh .] 
B|107| B: [uh .] 
A|108| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [oh] [that] sounds lovely [. uh-huh .] [oh] [the] wild flowers [are] beautiful [. i think] _um [i_ was] thinking [about] throwing [some] [for] [in the] [back] [just] [where] [the] [kids] [um] [just] _way_ [in the] [back] behind [the] swing sets [or] [just] [have some] wild flowers growing [back] [there] _would_ [be] [real] [pretty] . [then] [you] [don't] [really] [have [to] have] much maintenance involved . 
A|110| A: yep . 
B|111| B: [is] [it] [is] [it] [is] [it] flooding anywhere ? 
A|112| A: [oh .]

[so] i've] seen [a] wide range [of] both [you know] nonsalary type benefits [and] other stuff [you know] [like] health [care] [that's] either fully [or] partially paid [and] [you know] [some] [have] [like] bonuses [and] others [have] [had] lots [of] _vacation_ [time] [but] [not] much other types [of] benefits [and] [so] [yeah] [i] _would_ 
A|116| A: [i know] [i] love mine [too .] [well] [it's been] [nice] talking [to] [you] . 
B|117| B: [yeah . yeah [.] i think] [going] [to] [the] schools _would_ [be] [the] easiest [for] [them .] 
A|118| A: [so] [it's] its' [just] [different] . 
B|119| B: [yeah . yeah .]
