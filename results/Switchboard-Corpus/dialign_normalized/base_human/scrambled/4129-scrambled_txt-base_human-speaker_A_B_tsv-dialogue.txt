A|36| A: [and] nope [, we] haven't had much luck _with_ [it] we're going [to] try [it] again [this] year . 
B|37| B: [oh [,] that] sounds _nice_ [. i] [like] bluegrass , _too_ . 
A|38| A: [but _,] well_ [that's] [all] [i] [can] [really] [think] [about] [for] recycling . 
B|39| B: yes . 
A|40| A: brian [in] plano , texas . [how] [are you] _doing_ today ? 
B|41| B: [i think] [, i think] [the] regular schedule _stuff_ , [um] [, that] _when_ [you] say everybody get _out of_ _it [,_ that's] _a good_ [point] [, i] never [really] thought [of] [it] [that] way . 
A|42| A: [but] [they] _have [,_ i] read somewhere [, and] [i'm] , [i'm] [out] [on] [a] limb [here [,] some] [type] [of] college [, uh ,] volunteer [work for] teachers [, that] [they] [are] straight [out of] college [and they] [do] [one] year [of] volunteer [work] teaching _in [the_ [,] uh ,] lower income brackets [of the] united states . [have] [you] ever heard [about] [that] [one] ? 
B|43| B: [and [so] ,] based [on] [that ,] [who] [do] [you] [think] you're talking [to] , you're talking [to] [an] employer . 
A|44| A: [was] [it] [a] boy [or] [a] girl ? 
B|45| B: [and] [but ,] 
A|46| A: _and [,_ uh _,] so_ [when] [i] met _my_ husband , _he_ [was] watching football [and i] figured [out] [that] [i] couldn't [see] him [all] weekend [. i] couldn't [see] him until [like] tuesday [because] monday night football , [if] [i] didn't [, like] football . [so ,] 
B|47| B: [yeah [,] that's] [really] lovely [. i] [would] love [to have] different _fruit_ trees [. [it's] [,] it's] been wonderful _to have the_ peaches . _they're_ [just] delicious . [and [,] we] [, we] [we] [have ,] [still] [have] [to] _spray_ [some] [, but we] [don't have] [to] [just] asphyxiate ourself [with] [the] poison , _which is_ [good] , [because] [i] [just [,] i] can't [see] [the] [point] [in] [doing that] [and] eating [anything] [out of] [it] afterwards . 
A|48| A: [i don't] [think] [so] . 
B|49| B: [i [know] [,] [it's] [,] [it's] [,] it's] getting [, it's] been [out of] hand [, i think] [, for] [a] while [, and] [it] [just] continues [to] get worse . 
A|50| A: [but] [i] wish [that [,] uh ,] [more] [of the] cans [, you know , like] [the] cans [you] _buy_ vegetables [and] [fruit] [and] [stuff] [like that] [in] were recyclable [. i don't] [, [a] lot of] [that's] [that] recyclable steel [and _i] don't know_ anybody [that] takes [that .] 
B|51| B: [well ,] [my] dad , [all] [he] , [all] [he] wanted [to do] [was] get money [for] us [, so] [he] could [buy] us material [things .] 
A|52| A: [yeah .] 
B|53| B: why ? 
A|54| A: [yeah .] 
B|55| B: besides _which_ , [it would] _be_ easier [, uh [,] there's] [a lot of] single mothers [out] there now , [from] divorces [and] [a lot of] , women [are] starting [to have] babies without [a] partner . 
A|56| A: [that's] [the problem] [i] [have] [with] [it ,] [in] texas [they] [think] [it's] [and] [all] [and] [be] [all] , [they] [think] [that] [if] [they] electrocute [or] slip [, or] [do] [something] [, or] gas somebody [, uh [,] that] [they're] [not] going [to have the] crimes [that] [they] [do] [have] [and] [we] happen [to] live [in] dallas [which is] extremely crime , ridden , 
B|57| B: [yeah .] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] [we] did [that] [too] , 
B|59| B: [but [,] uh [,] well] [i] _got_ [my] thirty _day_ notice yesterday . 
A|60| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [and] [one of the] congressmen has , has written [in the] last three years [about] [a] thousand bad checks . 
A|62| A: [well ,] thank [you , you] [have] [a good] [day] . 
B|63| B: [it's] only getting worse exponentially [it] seems . 
A|64| A: [there's] [, uh ,] we've actually [got] [a] [kind [of] a] [nice] [set] [up] . we've [got] [a] couple [of] plants [here] [that] actually take [, uh ,] recycled paper [and] shred [it] [and] [spray] [it] [with] chemical treatment [so] [that] [it's not a] fire hazard [and] make [it] into insulation 
B|65| B: [but] [you know] [if] [something] [would] [, uh ,] whenever [something] happens [to] [one of] [them] [then [,] [i don't] know] [what] i'll [do] [up] there . 
A|66| A: no , [in] fact [some [of] the] [days] [we] froze [. it was] , 
B|67| B: [yeah .] 
A|68| A: [is] [it] choice [or] [just] business [or ,] 
B|69| B: [do] [you] ? 
A|70| A: [oh ,] gee .
