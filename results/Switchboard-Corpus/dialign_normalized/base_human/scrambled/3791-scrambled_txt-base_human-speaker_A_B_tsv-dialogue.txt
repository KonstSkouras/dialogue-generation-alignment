B|45| B: [oh] [uh] [i] [was] tested [uh] within _my_ company [. i think] [it's] _kind of_ [a] push [to] [uh] weed _out_ drugs [in] states [and] because [i don't know] [of] [any] _other_ countries _that are_ doing this 
A|46| A: [the] 
B|47| B: [no _i] mean_ [most _of] the_ sports cars [are] stick shift .

A|52| A: [right and] [try to] determine [if] [what you] read [was] objective _or not_ . 
B|53| B: [and i] often find [that] even when [i don't] [feel] [that] much [like] exercising [like] i'll _be_ [really] tired [and] i'll start swimming [and] i'll [and] i'll _actually_ _get_ energy .

A|58| A: [uh-huh .] [the] taxes [that] [people] [don't] [think] [about] [that] [yeah] [the [the] the] income tax [is] [a lot] [more] visible portion [of the] taxes [you] pay _i guess ._ 
B|59| B: [yeah .] 
A|60| A: [it's a] little _different_ [uh] challenge [isn't] [it] ? 
B|61| B: [bye .] 
A|62| A: [i think] [i think] years past maybe our criminals [had a] little [more] morals [you know] _wouldn't_ kill [somebody in] cold blood . 
B|63| B: [uh] . 
A|64| A: [yes .] 
B|65| B: [what] [about] [you] ? 
A|66| A: adapt . 
B|67| B: [right] [now] [like] [my] ... _right _._ well_ [like] [my] mother she has [to] go for testing cause she has [got] 
A|68| A: wonderful _place_ . 
B|69| B: he says [yeah] [but] [then] [i] [wouldn't] _have_ [you] [i] go [yeah] [but] [then] [you] _would_ _have_ _a lot of_ [money] 
A|70| A: [have] [that] [. well] [and it] [doesn't] seem [like] very [many people] [uh] [are] [really] [i mean] [there's a lot of] [people] [that are] on death row . [but] [there's] _not_ very [many people] [that] [actually] [um] . [do] [get] killed . 
B|71| B: [so] [i don't know] [if] [we] [we] did [a] good thing [to] [buy] [a] house [or not] [but] [at] least we've [got] [a] [place] [to] [live] . [um] [so] [now] since [uh] [we] [have] [a] three year old [and] [a] two year old [now] [um] 
A|72| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh] [right [.] yeah [.] that] [would] [be] neat [sure] . 
B|73| B: [so] [i guess] [that] makes [it] [easy] [to] recycle [and] [then] [they're they're] [uh] trying [to] make plastic goods [that] [don't] [have] [a] bunch [of] [different] plastics [in] [them] [you _know] [that_ are] [that are] only made [out] [of] [one] _kind of_ plastic [so] [that] [that] makes [it] easier [i guess .] 
A|74| A: [i know] [where] [you] [mean] . there [is] [a] mobil [and] [all] [that] [kind of] [uh] on [that] [one] corner [that's] [about] lookout there [i think] [isn't] [it .] 
B|75| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [do] [you] [uh] [take] your papers somewhere [or] does someone pick [them] [up] ? 
B|77| B: [well] [i know] [up] [in] connecticut [the] same thing happened [people are] devastated because [they] paid [so] much for their home . 
A|78| A: [and] [they're] being put [in] [the] middle [of the] city 
B|79| B: [oh] [really] ? 
A|80| A: [i [know] that] [it's] [not] settled [but] there [are] [other] areas [that] [we] [could] focus our attention on . 
B|81| B: [uh-huh .] [oh yeah] [they're] always [in] [florida] . [florida] [and] louisiana [i think] [and uh] some [of the] [other] southern states . 
A|82| A: huh . [no] . 
B|83| B: [yeah] [but] [so] i'm [kind of] [you know] [just] playing with [it] [but] [at] this point [we're going] [to] [kind of] wait [i think] [just] [more] for [the] financial reasons [of] [it] anyway [but]
