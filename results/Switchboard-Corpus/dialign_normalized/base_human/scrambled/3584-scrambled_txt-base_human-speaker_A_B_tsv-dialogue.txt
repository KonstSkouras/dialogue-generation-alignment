B|43| B: [really] [was] . 
A|44| A: _oh_ [they] [really] didn't propose [any] solutions . actually _they were_ [the] guy [was] pretty negative [about] [the] things [that] [the] government [was] [doing] [even] _though_ _he_ [was] [from] [the] e p [a] . 
B|45| B: [yeah .] _wasn't_ [that] [what] part [of the] lottery [is] [going _to] go_ [for] [if] [we] approve [it] ? 
A|46| A: [right .] 
B|47| B: [but] [when] [it] comes [to] _what kind of_ sentence [you're going to] lay [down] _i think_ _that [uh_ _that] they should_ .

B|61| B: [i _do] ._ 
A|62| A: [well] [i] used [to] make [the] regular pudding [the] chocolate [and] [put] [it] _in the_ pie shell [and if] _it would_ _sit_ _in the_ refrigerator _for a_ [day] [where] [you] cut [the] pie _it would_ soak into [the] pie shell _and [it_ was] [like] red [and] [i'm] [like] _oh_ this [is] [kind of] groedy . 
B|63| B: [you know] 
A|64| A: [i] went [well] [i] did work [um] [just] [very] [for] [some] time [but i] didn't make enough money [to] [really] make _too_ [much] [of a] difference . 
B|65| B: [uh you know] [i mean] [it was] ready [for] [the] graveyard . 
A|66| A: [yeah] seems [that they should] regulate [themselves] [a] little bit _and [i_ don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|67| B: [um] [yeah .] 
A|68| A: yep . 
B|69| B: [yeah] [she] [just] appeared . 
A|70| A: yep . 
B|71| B: [yeah] 
A|72| A: [um] [you know] [i'm] [not] sure [i'm] [not] positive [i] didn't [i] didn't [really] [think] [about] [that [.] i] [just] _remember_ [trying to] figure [out] [where] [you] could [get] [that] [was] real close _to the_ [good] section [but] _in the_ little bit cheaper [. but] [not that] i'll ever [go] [. [i] hadn't] _been_ [to] [a] cowboys game time last time [i] went _to the_ cowboys game [was] _during_ [that] [um] _n_ f l strike [or] [the] [when] [they] _had the_ scab team teams [in] _there_ _and [it_ was [the] uh] _dallas_ [and] washington redskins game [. _and] i_ went [because] [my] dad can usually [get] [a] hold [of some] free tickets [because] _a lot of_ those doctors [have] season tickets _and they_ [um] [if] [they're] [not] [going to] [use] _them_ they'll give _them_ [to] somebody else [. so] [my] dad [i] went [with] [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one] time [. but] [that] [wasn't] [a] real [you know] [it was] [it was the] scab teams [it was] [kind of] [you know] [it was] [kind of] [different] [i guess] [. and] _before_ [that] [it's] _been_ quite [a] few _years_ . i've _been_ wanting [to go] [to] [a] game [i] [just] never never [have] gotten around [to] [it [.] so] maybe this [year] . 
B|73| B: [right] [right [.] yeah] [it] [it would] almost [be] [like] [a] [a] [uh] ... 
A|74| A: [what] next ? 
B|75| B: [uh] [we] probably [were] listening [to] _c_ [n] [n] fairly heavily [before] _the war_ broadcasts began [. uh] [we] almost [live] [and and] breathed [it] [for] [because] _during the war_ itself [to the] [point] [where we] began [to] sort [of] [have] household pact [of] lets [turn] _the war_ off [and] [get] [something] [done] . 
A|76| A: _yes_ 
B|77| B: [and it] _isn't_ [because] [of the] [well] [there] has [been] [a lot of] speculative building [. uh] [i don't] [know] perhaps [not] [in] [dallas] 
A|78| A: [well] [i] [just] 
B|79| B: [oh] [on] [one] hand [i] [see] [that] [and] [on the] other hand [uh] [my] older sister remembers [when] [uh] [at] [one] [point] [they were] taking radioactive wastes [and] storing _them in_ tin barrels which [i guess] [had] [a] half-life [of] [oh] five [years] [if] [they] [sit] empty [on] dry land . 
A|80| A: [right .] are [you] married ? 
B|81| B: [i] [remember] food 
A|82| A: [you know] [you're] dooming [them] [to] ghetto life [or] whatever [. _and] i_ [know] [that] [that] [the] southeast asians [the] hmong _people that_ i've [done] [some] work [with] [uh] feel [very] quite hurt [and and] unsure [of] [themselves] [when] here . [because] [they're] coming [from] [you know] [from] [the] slash [and] burn intercultural society [you know] [they're] coming [from] [the] middle ages basically [. and] [they're] being plunked [down] plunked [down] into america . many [of] [them] [had] [been] promised by [the] [c] [i] [a] [during the war] over [there] [that] [because] [they] co-operated [with] [the] [c] [i] [a] _and they_ helped [the] [c] [i] [a] [out] [that] [when] [they] _came_ here [the] [c] [i] [a] [would] help establish [them in] america _and the_ [c] [i] [a] [of] course [isn't] _doing [that_ .] 
B|83| B: [well] [the] times [were] [different] [too] . 
A|84| A: [well] [that's] [it .] last [year] [i think it was] [you know] [my] peonies [were] [were] budding [in] january [and [you] know] [there] [was] no [way] [that] [was] [going to] make [it] [and] sure enough [you know] [we had] [really] mild weather [until] [i think it was] may [or] [something] 
B|85| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [i guess] [the] [one] [that] [really] [got] _me_ [too] [was] [that uh] [let's] [say] your spouse [is] [on] [a] particular drug [and _you] know what_ [that] [is] 
B|87| B: [and it] [came] [on] [t] v [the] other night [and [i] was] watching [it] again [and] [my] husband heard [me] laughing [and] [he] said [i] can't _believe_ [that] [you're] still getting such [a] kick [out] [of] [that] movie 
A|88| A: [they're] [not] [going to] recruit [me] anymore [i'm] [through] . no [more] [for] [me] . 
B|89| B: [yes] . 
A|90| A: [i] [know] [but] he's [a] man come [on] men [know] how [to] [do] _that right ?_ 
B|91| B: [oh] [really] [do] [they don't] [do] [any] damage [though] [they] [just] fly [right] [back] [out] [if] [you have] [the] 
A|92| A: [so] [you know] [people] who [don't] readily [read the] newspapers [in] our town [or] whatever 
B|93| B: [yeah .] 
A|94| A: [and] [they're] into sports 
B|95| B: [is] [that right ?] 
A|96| A: [but] [um] [then] [you] didn't [believe] _me about_ [her] kids *listen: this [and] utt2 [as] [one] utt are [the] [they] are [so] [good] . [i'm] [not] kidding [you] [but] [she] does work [with] [them] [and [it's] a] commitment [and that] [that's] [what they're] called [to] [do .] 
B|97| B: [it was] gorgeous . [it was] [just] gorgeous [. i mean] [just] gorgeous . [um] [and they] both [you know] both [the] half breed [and the] pure breed [had [the] uh] [what] [i] consider [the] [the] [the] perfect disposition [. but] [you know what] [you know what] scares [me about] golden retrievers ? [since] [they've] become [so] popular [you] [get] [what] [i] call backyard breeders . which [is] probably [where] yours [came] [from] . [people that] [don't] [know [what] they're] [doing] [and they] breed [them] [you know] [for a] certain characteristic [. and] [in the] retrievers [it] happens [to be] [they] [like] [them] big [for] [somehow] big [is] perceived [as] [the] [better] [. and] [when] [you] start [doing [that] you] [really] tamper [with] [you know] [the] [all] [the] [the] [years] [of] [uh] culling litters [and [and uh] you] tamper [with] [what] [the] dog innately [is] .
