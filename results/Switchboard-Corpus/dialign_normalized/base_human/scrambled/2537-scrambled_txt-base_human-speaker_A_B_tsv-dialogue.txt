A|42| A: [of] course . 
B|43| B: [now] [, that] [was] [the] assumption [that] [you] spent [that] [same] dollar [for] every _, for_ every item [on] [there] even though _there's_ [, uh ,] taxes [on] different things . 
A|44| A: [okay .] 
B|45| B: [oh ,] [oh ,] excuse me ?

A|52| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [well ,] _how_ [did] [you] [get a] recipe [for] pudding [on] [your] own ? 
A|54| A: yes . 
B|55| B: [yeah .] [one] [year] [they] [were] [, they] [were] [just] everywhere . 
A|56| A: that's [right .] [when] [we] [had] our pool done [i had] [them] [to] leave [some] extra loam [, you know [,] for] [my] garden [so] [i [had] [,] i had] _a lot of_ loam [out] [there] [to] [start] [with] [i] [just] turned [it] [all] up [and] mixed [it] [all] up together [with] , 
B|57| B: [yeah .]

A|60| A: bye-bye . 
B|61| B: [yeah [.] [i [,] uh [,] i] don't [know [,] i] think] [the [,] i] guess _there's [a_ lot of] problems [with the] legal system

A|66| A: [you] [do] [, like] arby's ? _see_ [i don't] [like] arby's . 
B|67| B: [and we] used [to] [go to] joe allen's barbecue [, and , uh ,] [oh [,] that] [was] great . 
A|68| A: [but [,] uh ,] [it's] [a] problem [, [and] [i] , i] [just [,] i think that] [the] court [systems] [need [to] be] [more] accurate [in] [, in] , stiffer [in] their penalties , 
B|69| B: [oh [,] i] [do] [too [,] i think] they're [doing] real [good] job . 
A|70| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [that] [is the] reason [, i don't] play over [there .] 
B|73| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [there] [, [there's] a] guy , [have] [you] _ever_ heard [of] george winston , he plays piano . 
B|75| B: yearly fee [, yeah .] 
A|76| A: [yeah .] 
B|77| B: _and the_ weight [of the] car [will] crush , what's [ever] [in the] disposer . 
A|78| A: [yeah .] [and] i'll [do] [this] [, uh ,] [sometimes] i'll [put] [my] after [i] pour [that] [into] [my] , [back] [into] [my] saucepan . i'll [put] [the] eggs [in the] [same] dish [and] beat [them] up [and then] pour [the] cornstarch [and the] milk mixture [in the] egg [. so ,] 
B|79| B: [and] [if] [you] want [to] [see] [them] [, you] might [just] [as] [well] enjoy football .
