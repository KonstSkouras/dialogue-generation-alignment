B|31| B: [uh-huh] 
A|32| A: _well_ there's [uh] places [in] wisconsin . there's [the] apostle islands _uh which_ _are_ [in] bayfield _which_ [is a] wonderful place . 
B|33| B: _it is_ [it] [really is] [. _and] [i_ mean] [they're] [the] first ones [that] take [the] brunt [of] everything . 
A|34| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [and] _get_ even [with] who [i mean] 
B|35| B: [yeah] _i like_ [the] [the] seafood _that they_ _when_ [they had] [it [you] know] [the] broiled 
A|36| A: [like] [for] drugs [for] drugs [they] [they] enforce [the] [death] penalty [for] [that [.] uh] [they're] [just] _very_ _very_ tough _and i guess_ maybe [that's the] _way_ tokyo [is] _too_ [or] japan [is] _too _._ they're_ [just] _very_ tough _on_ criminals . 
B|37| B: [right .] [so] [it's] [so] [that's] nice . [it] _would be_ [it] _would be_ [really] nice _if they_ [uh] came _to the_ _house_ [to] pick [it] _up and_ [they] [just] [were] talking [about] [a] bill [in] tucson [about] [that] [but uh] [uh] [it] didn't [go] through . 
A|38| A: [uh-huh] 
B|39| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: [yeah] [right .] _well i_ [can] remember _are_ from from [my] childhood [were] [the] disco _days_ [and] maybe [that's] changed [a lot] [. uh] [the] _way_ [the] _way_ [people] dress 
B|41| B: [i don't] [know] [if] _i'm_ [that] brave yet . 
A|42| A: [but] [my] golf clubs _will_ probably rust before [i] _get_ [to] use [them] again [because] [my] boys _are_ still [right] _at_ [the] beginning age [and] [it is] probably going [to be] six [to] eight years before [they] _go to_ college . 
B|43| B: [they're] cute [. they] _look_ [like] [an air] headed let me tell [you] [. they're] calm [they're] [not] yuppie [they're] trainable [they're] [uh] [very] personable [in] [a different] [way] [that] [a] golden retriever [is] [. they're] [not] dignified [like] [a] retriever [can] [be] . 
A|44| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [and] upstairs [we _have] a_ bath [a] bath _oh_ [we _have] a_ _half_ bath downstairs [too .] 
A|46| A: [that] _yes [._ i _i] think that_ _could_ [be] [a] _big_ problem [you know] [i] [would] [just] [be] irate [if they] [said] [it] was positive [and i] knew [it] wasn't 
B|47| B: [uh] [it] [it does] [uh] [i don't] [know] [it] [it's] [really] [more] _fun_ than anything else . [as] [long] [as] [you're] [not] stuck [in] heavy traffic [it's] _fun_ 
A|48| A: [right] _that you_ [right .] _that's right ._ 
B|49| B: [yeah .] _now_ [what] [about] [you] [if you] [could] [have] [the] car [that you] wanted [what] [would] [you get] 
A|50| A: [and i] [would] [not] [have] _been_ [fun] trying [to] retrieve her [but uh] [this] dog dennis jumped [in] [and] [got] [this] [look] _on_ his face [like] [what] _do_ [i] _do_ [now] [as] he's floating down [the] river _then_ finally discovered [that] he [could] swim [and uh] [actually] paddled [up] against [the] current [and uh] made [it] back [to the] shore [and] climbed [up and] _then_ he he jumped [in] again [and] he was swimming [for] quite [a] _bit_ [all] afternoon . he loved [it] . 
B|51| B: [the] _thing_ [i don't] [like] [about] dogs sometimes _is that_ [the] _house_ [will] [just] reek _of the_ dogs [and] constantly . 
A|52| A: [so] [um] _i think that_ [that] [would be] [a] real [a] real [uh] advantage [to] [to] her _to have_ [that] [and uh] _do_ [it] early 
B|53| B: [we] [only] _see_ [the] tip _of the_ iceberg [only] . 
A|54| A: [uh-huh] 
B|55| B: [well [i] guess] [a lot] _of the_ [uh] something [that's] [kind of] [more] [of a] comedy [. we] [do] [have] [uh] cable _and [we_ have] premium stations [like] h b [o] [and] showtime [and] such [and i guess] [a lot] [of] times _when_ [i] first turn [the] t v [on] [i i] normally [go to] _those_ [because] [i] pay [for] [them] 
A|56| A: [it] might [be] handy 
B|57| B: hi [well [i] guess] [which] one [have] [you] [got] [right] [now] ? [or] 
A|58| A: _well that's_ [good] . _sounds like_ [you're] [have a] handle [on] [it] . 
B|59| B: [uh] jazz . 
A|60| A: [um] hobbies [i like] messing around [in] _your_ [house] building things _and you know_ putting cabinets [up and] [those] [kind of] things [um] 
B|61| B: [well [that's] right [.] uh] [i think that] _oh_ politicians _talk_ [a lot] [about] waste 
A|62| A: [and [we] just] moved _here uh_ we've _been_ [here] before lived [in] minneapolis saint paul _uh which_ has [an] exceedingly low crime _rate_ [and] _then_ [we] [were] transferred back [here] [and] [when] [you're] _gone_ from [some] place [like] [it] [for] [about] six years [as] [we] [were] [you] [really] begin [to] [see] [uh] [just] how problematic [just] living [is] even suburban [no] matter where [you] _are_ 
B|63| B: [well] . 
A|64| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: _oh_ [that] [sounds like] [a] [fun] [fun] field . 
A|68| A: [uh-huh [.] uh] [so] [i] most [of the] kids [here] [i] [you know] [like] [you know] [just] from dorm mates [and] [stuff] they'll _say_ [that they] [don't] believe [in] [it] [but] _then_ after [i] [would] _say_ [my] point [of] view _then_ they'll _say_ [well] [yeah] [you know] [you know] . 
B|69| B: [it's] [just] [kind of] [uh] [we're] [supposed [to] [have] a] chance [to get] [some] rain [the] next couple [of] [days] [here [uh] which] [will] [be] [you know _a little bit] more_ typical [uh] autumn weather [. but] [really] [it's] strange [. we] haven't [really] [had] [an] autumn [. it's] [like] [we] went into winter 
A|70| A: [oh] gosh chris xeros [you] [grew up with] his children [too] _then_ ? 
B|71| B: [well] [now] [you] [you] [say] two [different] parts [of _the] country_ [what] [are] [are] [are] [you] referring [to] yourself [or] 
A|72| A: [yeah] [that's] [that's right] [talk] [to] [i] [had] [to] [talk] [about] gun control [with] somebody [and i] talked [with] [a] woman who [actually] [you know] [had] [just] purchased [a] gun [that] day [and] was going target shooting [you know] 
B|73| B: [and [i] i] feel [like] [it's] [really] [just] within [the] united states [. it's] [uh] [it's] okay [. [i] think] [your] record should stand [for] itself . [that you know] [if] [you've] [been] tested [at] [other] companies [and] [you've] [always] come [up] negative [or whatever] [then] [i don't] [see] [what the] [big] deal _is [that_ they] [have [to] [go] to] _all the_ expense [of] testing [you] _over_ [and] _over_ [and] _over_ . 
A|74| A: [and] [um] [i think that] [if] [we] [had] enough money [and] paid [the] teachers [a little bit more] [that] maybe [that] [could] solve [some] [of] our problems . 
B|75| B: [uh-huh . uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: [right .] [yeah] [that] [would be] [a] real [good] motivation [for] [people] . 
B|77| B: [have] [you] ever _had a_ car [with an air] bag ? 
A|78| A: physics . 
B|79| B: [yeah] 
A|80| A: [and [we] just] [had a] [really] [big] ice storm [. and] basically [half] [the] trees [in] [in] our city [i'm] [in] rochester [which] [is] [uh] [right] upstate . [half] [of the] trees [in] [the] city [uh] [are] [no] [good] anymore . 
B|81| B: [and you know] [there] [are] reason [to] [look] [for] another job instead [of] [just] dumping [it] [on] [them] [all] [at] one [time] . 
A|82| A: [uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [uh-huh [uh-huh .] uh-huh .] 
A|84| A: [yeah] [that] must [have] [been] [at] least fifty years ago [or] [more] [but] [the] point [of the] story [is that] [that] was [so] unbelievable [a] [thing] [in] [those] [days] [that] [it] was [in] [all the] papers [all] [over] [the country] [for] weeks 
B|85| B: [right [.] uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [the rest of] [them] taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' money [for] [that .] 
B|87| B: [yes .] 
B|88| B: [yes] especially [the] murder [rate] its [just] [gone] crazy . [yes .]
