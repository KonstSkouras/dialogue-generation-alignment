B|53| B: [well [,] that's] [good .] 
A|54| A: _yes ._ [uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: [oh ,] [okay] [, well ,] first [, they] always say , get [to] [know] your country first before [you] leave [, [i] mean] [i , i] lived [in] places , [like]

B|57| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [yeah .] [uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: we've [been] , we've [been] [, uh ,] writing [a] story [together .] 
A|60| A: [that's] [even] harder [. _but] ,_ 
B|61| B: [and] he thoroughly [enjoyed] [it] . 
A|62| A: [it is] temporary [. [it] ,] [in the] middle [of] [it [,] _it] [seems_ [like] a] long [time] , 
B|63| B: [yes .] absolutely . 
A|64| A: [i mean] [, we] [are] [all] different [so ,] 
B|65| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|66| A: [yes .] 
B|67| B: [but] anyway [, [i] enjoy] [it] . [they] [, they] [, the] kids i've worked _with_ [so] far [have] [been] spanish speaking . 
A|68| A: wow wow [, that's] , 
B|69| B: [or] [, uh ,] 
A|70| A: [yeah . _well ,] i_ figure [it's] [just] [me] [and] [my] wife _but [,_ you know [,] i] [like] [to do] stuff [with] [my] hands [and] whatnot , [so] [i want to] [have a] shop . 
B|71| B: [uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [or] would [they] [really] [, you know ,] _make a_ contribution [of] [some] [kind] . 
B|73| B: anyway [, well] [the] question [is] [, you know ,] [do] [you] [think [,] it] does [make a] difference [in] [whether or [not] a] criminal commits [a] crime [or] [do] [you] [think] [it] can [if] [it's] [done] [right] ? 
A|74| A: [right .] 
B|75| B: [i'm] building [our] house [right] [now] [and i'm] [going to] incorporate [into] [my] [, uh ,] garage area [a] weight activated [, uh ,] crusher . 
A|76| A: [you know [,] we] had three hundred [thousand] [people] without power . 
B|77| B: [well [, i] don't] [want [to] [,] i don't] [want] [this] [to be a] unilateral [conversation] [but ,] [yes] [, we] [do] . both [my] husband [and i] _work_ [and] [our] children [are] sixth , [fourth] [, and] third [grade] [. [and] the] school years [are] wonderful [, they're] [just] wonderful . 
A|78| A: huh . 
B|79| B: [i'm] [in dallas] [, texas] . 
A|80| A: [and [i] [,] and i] bet [it] gives [you] [a] real [good] feeling [to be] doing [that .] 
B|81| B: [right .] [that's] [a] [, that's] [a] common [problem] _though ._ [that] [it seems] , [that] [has] happened [in dallas] [as] [well] [as] new york [and i] [try to] recycle [all] [of] [the] newspapers [that] come [to] [my] house [and] after [a] while [i just] quit taking [the] newspaper _because_ [i] couldn't recycle [it] anymore which isn't [good] [for] business [on] [the] other end either [, i] suppose . 
A|82| A: [probably] at [all] . 
B|83| B: [and] [oh [,] my] husband [just] died . 
A|84| A: cocoa [didn't think] _too_ [much] [of] [it ,] [though .] she jumped [in] [and] [then] started screaming [and] made [me] pull her back _out [._ i] pulled her _out_ _and , uh ,_ [then] had [to] wrap her [up] [in a] sweatshirt [because] she [was] shivering [so] bad , 
B|85| B: [i] [kind] [of [,] i think] [so ,] [too] [. [i] think] [that's] [a bit] dramatic , [but ,] [but] other than [that] [i think] [it's , it's] [a good] idea [to] get [them] involved [in] city [and] community activities [and [,] you know ,] [like] [the] [, uh ,] shelters [and , uh ,] [that] [kind] [of ,] thing , helping [out] [, uh ,] volunteering [, [i] guess] [, if] [they] can . 
A|86| A: [uh ,] [got] [, you know] tomatoes [that] [are] starting [to] bloom 
B|87| B: [all] [right .] 
A|88| A: [but [,] i] used [to] [work] [for] [a] power company , [so] [it] [was] very important [that] [they] [make] [sure] [their] employees , especially linemen [uh ,] [were] clean . 
B|89| B: [the] one [that] [was] [in] [for the] seventeen years [, actually] served seven [, and] [he's] [out .]
