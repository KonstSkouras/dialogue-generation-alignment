B|65| M:  ? 
A|66| B: [and] _uh_ [that's] more important [than] anything else . we _could have_ sent _uh_ her [to] [a] fancier _uh_ facility .

A|88| B: [you know] [it] [it's] [a] little scary [too] when they're coming up [and] they're all over [you] . 
B|89| M: [i like] [the] [ones that] come [with the] [ones] [i] bought . 
A|90| B: [well] [if] [they] close [it] [in] see we'll [have the] best [of] both worlds then as they're talking [about] doing . 
B|91| M:  ... [uh] 
A|92| B: [right [.] yeah] my backyard is [uh] is sloping [so] [i] built [a] box up [you know] [had [to] build] [the] one [the] low side up .

B|99| M: [so] they'll wait [uh for] [someone] [to] [do] [it uh] . 
A|100| B: [i] guess one [thing] they're working [on] now is recycling plastics [too .] [like] [uh] 
B|101| M: [okay] [um] i'll [be] [here] .
