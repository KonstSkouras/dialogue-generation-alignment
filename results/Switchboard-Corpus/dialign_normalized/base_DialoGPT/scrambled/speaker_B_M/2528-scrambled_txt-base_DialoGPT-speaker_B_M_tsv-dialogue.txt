B|63| M: [what] [about] [it ?] 
A|64| B: uh-huh . [well] , [i] thought [was] funny [that] [they] kept pushing [the] three eighty-six s x _even_ though [the] , [the] price difference is [about] ten dollars . 
B|65| M:  ? 
A|66| B: [and] _, uh ,_ [that's] more important [than] anything else . we _could have_ sent _, uh ,_ her [to] [a] fancier _, uh ,_ facility . 
B|67| M: [so [,] you're] saying [, you] [could _have] the_ entire [thing] done [in] 5 [years] ? 
A|68| B: uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [i [don't] think] [you can] recycle paper bags ... 
A|70| B: [so ,] 
B|71| M: [you're] [right .] 
A|72| B: [and] he spends , [well] , [right] now , he's down [to] [like] once [a] week [, but] he [was] going over there several times [a] week [to be] _with the_ family [, and] help them _with the_ language .

B|77| M:  
A|78| B: [i] would hope we [could] _do that_ [, and] then go _from_ there . 
B|79| M: did [i] say something wrong ?

A|86| B: [i ,] [i] [got] [a] few peas [out] my garden [a] couple [of] days ago . 
B|87| M: [i] [can] [do that] 
A|88| B: [you know ,] _it [,_ it's] [a] little scary [too] when they're coming up [and] they're all over [you] . 
B|89| M: [i like] [the] [ones that] come [with the] [ones] [i] bought . 
A|90| B: [well] , [if] [they] close [it] [in] , see , we'll [have the] best [of] both worlds then as they're talking [about] doing . 
B|91| M:  ... [uh] 
A|92| B: [right [.] [yeah] ,] my backyard is _, uh ,_ is sloping [so] [i] built [a] box up [, you know] [had [to] build] [the] one , [the] low side up . 
B|93| M: [are] [you] [from] missouri ? 
A|94| B: uh-huh . 
B|95| M:  . 
A|96| B: [i've] [had] [a] burmese python , [i've] [had] rats , [i've] [had] mice 
B|97| M: uhhh [, yes [,] you] [are] . 
A|98| B: [yeah ,] [it] must [be] [fun] [to be] able [to] play [it] [and] [, [you know] ,] [if] [you can] play tunes [that] people [can] sing along [to] it'd [be] , it'd [be] kind [of] [fun ,] [i think] . 
B|99| M: [so] they'll wait [, uh , for] [someone] [to] [do] [it , uh] . 
A|100| B: [i] guess one [thing] they're working [on] now is recycling plastics [too .] [like] [, uh]
