A|70| B: probably [, yeah] [yeah [.] but] [, uh ,] [no] , [it's] , [it's] sad , though , [that [,] uh ,] [that] [the] _people_ , though , [that] [you] _, you_ , somebody's life [is] [in] twelve people's hands [and] sometimes those twelve _people_ _could_ care less . 
B|71| M: [oh [,] and the [,] uh _,] the_ smo ... [oh _,] well ,_ _they have_ [the] smoo ... 
A|72| B: [well] another [reason] [, [well ,] _i] guess_ [i] can't say [that] [it] [, [i] don't] [like] [the] rain completely . [we] [have [a] little] garden [that] [we] [have] [and] [and] [so] [it] really helps our garden , 
B|73| M: [i _know] ._ 
A|74| B: we've been fifteen , fifteen years [in] [the ,] [in] [the] _house_ [that] [we're] living [in] . 
B|75| M: _why_ _are you_ gone 
A|76| B: [i [,] [i] think] [it] _has_ [to be] some kind [of] common sense applied [there] _. and_ [there] may [be] where [the] judiciary [is] [a little] more learned _about_ [that] type [of] _thing_ because [they] [can] [be] schooled [in] [that] kind [of] _thing ,_ 
B|77| M: [the] last [time] [i] did [that ,] [it] _was_ [for] [the] second [time] 
A|78| B: [oh] [that's] terrible . 
B|79| M: [i don't] _know ._ 
A|80| B: [it's] [like] get [a] painter _, [you_ know ,] _or_ something , [a] artist [. it's] [like] [well] [you] , [how] _do you_ really rate _, [you_ know ,] michelangelo _, [you_ know] [how] would [you] tell [if] [he was] _, [you_ know ,] really [good] _or_ so-so _or_ whatever 
B|81| M: [i don't] [know [,] i'm] _from the_ uk [and i've] [never] seen [a] single [thing] [about] [it] . 
A|82| B: pretty [good] trip . [so] [what] _do you_ _, what_ kind [of] hobbies [are you] [in] ? 
B|83| M: _she_ [has] [her] own problems . 
A|84| B: because [, uh _,] [you_ know ,] [that] all depends , too , on where [you] [are] at . [that's] [, uh ,] sort [of] interesting [to] get opinions as [to] where different parts [of] [the] country [are .] because [the] more grass root country [, uh ,] parts [of] [the] country tend [to] , [to] support capital punishment , where [the] places [that] [are] _, [you_ know ,] less [in] contact with _crime_ [you know [,] the [,] the] more , more urban [, [i] mean] less , 
B|85| M: [uh [,] uh [,] uh] . 
A|86| B: [yeah .] our _cat_ [we] got [from the] pound [the] day [the] night [she] [was] _going to be_ [put] [to] sleep . [so] [that's] [why] [we] call [her] liberty . 
B|87| M: [you] [could] [always] just unload _it and_ park [it] . 
A|88| B: uh-huh . _yeah ,_ ready [to] [go] another twelve hours . _yeah [,_ yeah .] 
B|89| M: [is] [that] true ? 
A|90| B: [put] [a little] bitty portable _computer_ [in] [there] [and] [a] plasma display _. and_ make [it] look [like] things [like] [, uh _,] [you_ know ,] attack simulators [and [,] and] all sorts [of] [little] things you'd want [to] [put] your finger on [the] screen [for] . 
B|91| M: [you] [mean] unsweet ? 
A|92| B: [yeah .] 
B|93| M: [i don't] [know] [about] [you] [but] [i've] [never] seen [a] judge [or] jury [that] wasn't guilty [of a] [crime] . 
A|94| B: [it's] [always] [have to] [have] [it] now . 
B|95| M: [do [you] [have] a] [cat] ? 
A|96| B: _yeah ,_ [same] with drunk drivers .

B|109| M: [i'm] sorry [, i'm] [not] sure [what] [you] [mean] . 
A|110| B: [and] [so] [, uh _,] [you_ know ,] at work [a lot of] _people_ [are] _, [you_ know [,] [i] think] [well] [this is] [not a] normal situation anymore [in] our , [in] our [world] [we] live [in] . [most] [of] them [, uh ,] continue [to] work [if] [they have] , [have] kids . 
B|111| M: [yeah [,] what] ? 
A|112| B: [you] bet . 
B|113| M: [i like] [you] .

B|115| M: [i] . 
A|116| B: [and] everyone [always] asked [if] [the] [girl] got spoiled . 
B|117| M: [if] [you're] [not] sure [, you] should [be] . 
A|118| B: [well ,] [if] [you] , enjoy [it] too [, [you] know [,] you] [, you] [can] get out [in] [the] [morning] when , before [it] gets hot [and [,] and] [do] [it and] stuff , when [you] only [have to] , 
B|119| M: [i guess] [it] [is] . 
A|120| B: [so] you'd , you'd rather see [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
B|121| M: [yeah [.] and] [there's a] bunch [of] trees [in] rochester . 
A|122| B: uh-huh . 
B|123| M: [i] [have [a] lot of] [family] [that] lives [in] minneapolis [, so] [i'm] [not] [going to be] able [to] rent [a] [house] .
