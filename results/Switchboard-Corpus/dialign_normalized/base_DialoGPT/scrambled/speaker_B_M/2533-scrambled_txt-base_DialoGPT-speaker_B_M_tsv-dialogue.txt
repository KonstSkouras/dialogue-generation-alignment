A|70| B: probably [yeah] [yeah [.] but] [uh] [no] [it's] [it's] sad though [that] [uh] [that] [the] _people_ though [that] [you] [you] somebody's life [is] [in] twelve people's hands [and] sometimes those twelve _people_ _could_ care less . 
B|71| M: [oh] [and the] [uh] [the] smo ... [oh] _well _they_ have_ [the] smoo ... 
A|72| B: [well] another [reason] [well _i] guess_ [i] can't say [that it] [i don't] [like] [the] rain completely . [we] [have [a] little] garden [that] [we] [have] [and] [and] [so] [it] really helps our garden 
B|73| M: [i _know] ._ 
A|74| B: we've been fifteen fifteen years [in] [the] [in] [the] _house_ [that] [we're] living [in] . 
B|75| M: _why_ [are you] gone 
A|76| B: [i] [i think] [it] _has_ [to be] some kind [of] common sense applied [there] _. and_ [there] may [be] where [the] judiciary [is] [a little] more learned _about_ [that] type [of] _thing_ because [they] [can] [be] schooled [in] [that] kind [of] _thing_ 
B|77| M: [the] last [time] [i] did [that it] _was_ [for] [the] second [time] 
A|78| B: [oh] [that's] terrible . 
B|79| M: [i don't] _know ._ 
A|80| B: [it's] [like] get [a] painter [you know] _or_ something [a] artist [. it's] [like] [well] [you] [how] _do you_ really rate [you know] michelangelo [you know] [how] would [you] tell [if] [he was] [you know] really [good] _or_ so-so _or_ whatever 
B|81| M: [i don't] [know] [i'm] _from the_ uk [and i've] [never] seen [a] single [thing] [about] [it] . 
A|82| B: pretty [good] trip . [so] [what] _do you_ [what] kind [of] hobbies [are you] [in] ? 
B|83| M: _she_ [has] [her] own problems . 
A|84| B: because [uh] [you know] [that] all depends too on where [you] [are] at . [that's] [uh] sort [of] interesting [to] get opinions as [to] where different parts [of] [the] country [are .] because [the] more grass root country [uh] parts [of] [the] country tend [to] [to] support capital punishment where [the] places [that] [are [you] know] less [in] contact with _crime_ [you know] [the] [the] more more urban [i mean] less 
B|85| M: [uh] [uh] [uh] . 
A|86| B: [yeah .] our _cat_ [we] got [from the] pound [the] day [the] night [she] [was] _going to be_ [put] [to] sleep . [so] [that's] [why] [we] call [her] liberty .

B|91| M: [you] [mean] unsweet ? 
A|92| B: [yeah .] 
B|93| M: [i don't] [know] [about] [you] [but] [i've] [never] seen [a] judge [or] jury [that] wasn't guilty [of a] [crime] . 
A|94| B: [it's] [always] [have to] [have] [it] now .

B|109| M: [i'm] sorry [i'm] [not] sure [what] [you] [mean] . 
A|110| B: [and] [so] [uh] [you know] at work [a lot of] _people_ [are [you] know] [i think] [well] [this is] [not a] normal situation anymore [in] our [in] our [world] [we] live [in] . [most] [of] them [uh] continue [to] work [if] [they have] [have] kids . 
B|111| M: [yeah] [what] ? 
A|112| B: [you] bet . 
B|113| M: [i like] [you] . 
A|114| B: [i mean] [it's] [like] [if] [you] plan [a] [year] ahead [you] [can] probably save up seven hundred dollars [you know] _one_ thousand four hundred dollars [to] send your child [to] college [you [know] .] 
B|115| M: [i] . 
A|116| B: [and] everyone [always] asked [if] [the] [girl] got spoiled . 
B|117| M: [if] [you're] [not] sure [you] should [be] . 
A|118| B: [well] [if] [you] enjoy [it] too [you know] [you] [you] [can] get out [in] [the] [morning] when before [it] gets hot [and] [and] [do] [it and] stuff when [you] only [have to] 
B|119| M: [i guess] [it] [is] . 
A|120| B: [so] you'd you'd rather see [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
B|121| M: [yeah [.] and] [there's a] bunch [of] trees [in] rochester . 
A|122| B: uh-huh . 
B|123| M: [i] [have [a] lot of] [family] [that] lives [in] minneapolis [so] [i'm] [not] [going to be] able [to] rent [a] [house] . 
A|124| B: [i] would [have] thought 
B|125| M: [how] does [one] use [a] [computer] ? 
A|126| B: [so] they're professionals ?
