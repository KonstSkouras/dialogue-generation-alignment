A|86| B: uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|87| M: _i guess_ _you could_ [say] [it's] raining 
A|88| B: judge 
B|89| M: [we] did aerobiic _stuff_ [together , and] [we] made [some] [really] cool _stuff_ 
A|90| B: [they] [just] overflow . 
B|91| M: [it] 
A|92| B: [yes ,] uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [i] 
A|94| B: eye care [is] _good ._ [i] [do] [not , i] am [not] [i] [do] [not] [think] [we] [have] [that] [on] our policy . 
B|95| M: [i] . 
A|96| B: [and] [they're] both boys [so] [they] [just] _one_ year after [the] other [in] each other's clothes [, so] . [but] , um [, that's] [the] hardest part [for] us [is] [that] [it's] [really] , um [, you know ,] budgeting [and] [some] extra things [, you know [,] that] [are] more [, you know ,] nonessential items . 
B|97| M: [oh ,] [we're] [, we] [, and] [it's [,] [you] ,] we've [, it [,] it's] 
A|98| B: _now_ [i] am [i] am adamantly against [that .]

B|105| M: [i'm] sorry [, [i] don't] understand [what] [you're] saying . 
A|106| B: [we] [just] [have the] case [, i'm] [, i'm] sure [you've] [probably] heard [of] marion berry . 
B|107| M: [the] [game] [is] [a lot] faster [now] . 
A|108| B: [uh] [uh [,] uh ,] although [i] [do] [, uh [,] [a] lot] [of] , 
B|109| M: [i think] [you're] [right .] 
A|110| B: [but] [they] selectively culled those litters [, i] [mean] , [for] many hundreds [of] [years] [and] since [it] slept [in the] castle [with] its master [, i] [mean] [it] [had] [, it] [had] [to] [be] [of] [a] disposition [to] make [it [,] you know ,] [an] animal [you could] keep around [that] closely . [but] [they] [would] go through all [the] litters [and] destroy [the] puppies [if] [they] [were] [anything] other than perfect . [now] [, you know [,] that] seems [like] [a] cruel thing [to do] . 
B|111| M: _when you_ [say] [you're] [a] big guy , [do you] [mean] [you] walk [or] [do you] walk [and] [do] [it] ?

A|118| B: [i have] _one_ [and] [i can] [not] remember [the] name [of] [it [,] uh [,] it] [is] supposed [to] [be] [a] mystery . 
B|119| M: [i don't] . 
A|120| B: _yeah [,_ it] gets kind [of] [, [i] [,] we] used [to] [have] _one_ [of] those little caves [you can] go back [in] [get] [out] [of the] rain . 
B|121| M: [yeah ,] [but] [the] houses [were] large [, so] [the] car [was] [the] [size] [of the] garage . 
A|122| B: [yeah] . [i think] [some] [of] , [is] [how] [the] [, uh [,] you know [,] i guess] [it's not] [really] [a] direct benefit [but] [how] your [, uh ,] performance [is] rated [and] [stuff] [like] [that] at work . 
B|123| M: i've been [to the] [very] top [of the world] [and] [i'm] [in the] [very] bottom [of the] earth . 
A|124| B: [well ,] [when you] [when you] go [out] into [the] [, uh ,] [when you] go [out] into [the] [working] [world] [it [,] it] changes quickly . 
B|125| M: [uh ,] [what] ? 
A|126| B: [so] [that] has put [a] crimp [in] my every activity other than diapers [and] laundry [, i'll] tell [you] 
B|127| M: [i'll] [be] [the] [one] [who] grows . 
A|128| B: [right .] 
B|129| M: [that] [is] [what] [i] [get] [for] trying [to] understand [the] question .
