B|49| M:  ... 
A|50| B: [yeah] .

A|74| B: [well] [do] [we] ?

A|76| B: nevertheless [you] maintain [that] [it's] _it is_ [the right] [of] [of] any citizen [to] [burn] [the] symbol [of] _their_ country . 
B|77| M: you've [i've] seen [the] movie [but] _never_ seen [the] book .

B|85| M: [he] [was] [so] mad . 
A|86| B: oh okay . [so] [but] um now [i don't] [know] [but] um [but] let's see [when] [i was] eleven [i] went also [to] [the] caribbean .
