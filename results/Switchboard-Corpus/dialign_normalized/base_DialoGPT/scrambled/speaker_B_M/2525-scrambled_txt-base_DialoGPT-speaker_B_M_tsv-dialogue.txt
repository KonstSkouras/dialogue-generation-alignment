A|50| B: [but uh] mine _was_ _a year_ old 
B|51| M: [you're] [right [.] _i] think_ [it's] [because] [it's] [a] tomatos . 
A|52| B: [and] [uh] [so] that's [the] program [that] [they're] using there . 
B|53| M: _you ._ 
A|54| B: uh-huh . 
B|55| M: _have a_ [good] [day] ! 
A|56| B: [and] _what_ happened [is] _is that_ [people] wanted [this] shepherd [to] shepherd [and] protect . [and] _they_ bred [a] dog [that] [i] [it's] called [a] an animal's critical span which basically translates [to] [how] much shit will [it] take before [it] bites [you .] [that] german shepherd [the] american german shepherd here _was_ [a] [a] [a] such an unreliable animal [that] [the] american seeing eye institute refused [to] use them [because] _they_ _would_ turn _on_ _on_ their handlers . 
B|57| M: [oh] . 
A|58| B: [it] _was_ bred out [of] several different retrievers [and] _they_ bred [it] _for_ companionship [and] [uh] [uh] disposition [and] [and] ability [to] hunt . [it] _was_ kept _only_ by kings . 
B|59| M: uhh [i] [would] [think] _it would_ [be] [at] least five [in the] [evening] . 
A|60| B: uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [it's] [been] [a] while _huh_ ? 
A|62| B: [but] [we] wanted one [that] [could] carry [a] lot [of] equipment . [so] [we] chose [a] nissan stanza wagon . 
B|63| M: travel expenses . 
A|64| B: [well] _same_ here . _thanks for_ calling . 
B|65| M: _well i_ came _from_ texas [and] [my] mother [was] _from_ florida 
A|66| B: [yeah] [yeah] [it] [it] [really] [is] [uh] [but] gee _this is_ [of] all [the] topics [i have] [had] [i'm] doing [this] _thing_ _this is_ [kind _of] the_ strangest one . 
B|67| M: [it] [is] [in] fact [the only thing] [that is] [not] free [is the] service station . 
A|68| B: uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [i] wouldn't 
A|70| B: uh-huh 
B|71| M: [he's] [not a] [big] [guy] . 
A|72| B: [yeah] [i have] got [some] [of] those too cause [i] love flowers 
B|73| M: [i don't _know] [i_ don't] [really] [have] any friends 
A|74| B: [she] doesn't [have a] brown nose [and] her she's sort [of] unicolor [you know] eyes [are] _the same_ color [and] everything 
B|75| M: uhh ... [how] ? 
A|76| B: [you] just [like] [i don't] want [that] [person] sharing [the] earth with [me you [know] [i] mean] [that is] just terrible . 
B|77| M: [you] 
A|78| B: [yeah] . probably that's [true] . [but i] [know] [a] lot [of] their [a] lot [of] their specials sometimes [are] fried _things_ [that] [you] _can't_ [really] _get_ away [from] [the] fried 
B|79| M: [it's not] . 
A|80| B: [you] [have to] cut each [thing] _or_ [you know] use [the] melon baller [and] [stuff] [but] [but [i] think] [they're] [really] neat [and] [you [know] [i] think] [they're] worth _the time_ [you know] [because] _they_ 
B|81| M: [the] police [have] [been] known [to do] [things] . 
A|82| B: [yeah] . see [i'm] unfamiliar with [that] [because] [i don't] [i] never see [that] end _of the_ business . 
B|83| M: _yes ._ 
A|84| B: [you] too . 
B|85| M: [i have] [the] _problem_ [of the] cat being [in [the] same] room 
A|86| B: [well] [it] [was] [good] talking [to] [you] too . 
B|87| M: [oh] [it's not] [that] bad . 
A|88| B: _what_ about [like] those grocery bags ? 
B|89| M: [yeah] [but] [it's not] [the same] . 
A|90| B: [right .] [right .] 
B|91| M: [i] 
A|92| B: [and] their economy [is] [of] several [of the] countries especially columbia [is] [so] built _on the_ _on_ _on the_ _drugs_ [that] [uh] our our little war _on_ _drugs_ has [really] [been] laughable . [it's] just [a] [you know] such [a] small amount [and] [it] [it] just [it] [uh] cuts off just [a] trickle [and] [uh] [if] [if] [we] _can't_ _get_ [a] handle _on_ [that] through [some] through [some] [uh] method [i don't know] where [that] will [be] another [big] [problem] . 
B|93| M: [it's] [the same] [as] [how] [we] treat everyone else . 
A|94| B: [really] ? [huh] [oh] [yeah] that's [true] hadn't thought about [that] . [that is] very inconvenient . 
B|95| M: hey [thanks for] [the time] . 
A|96| B: [yeah] [well] [he's] [he's] out [for] cardboard . 
B|97| M: [i think] [the] point [of] [this [is] that] [it] _makes_ [people] [think] [it's] [a] [good] idea [to] buy [drugs] . 
A|98| B: [i] [know] _they_ lost [yeah] [to] washington [and] philadelphia . 
B|99| M: [they] [are] [on the] rise [in the area .] 
A|100| B: [uh] [but] 
B|101| M: [why] [would] [you] [do] [that] ? 
A|102| B: [it] [was] [same] [time] period [yes .] 
B|103| M: [yeah] [she] likes [to] eat . 
A|104| B: [well i] guess [i] better [go] . 
B|105| M: [i have] [the] . 
A|106| B: [it would] _get_ snatched [right] off your arm 
B|107| M: [i'm] ? 
A|108| B: [so] [i] guess [that] [makes] [it] [easy to] recycle [and] then [they're] [they're] [uh] trying [to] make plastic goods [that] [don't [have] a] bunch [of] different plastics [in] them [you know] [that are] [that are] [only] made out [of] one [kind of] plastic [so] [that] [that] [makes] [it] easier [i] guess . 
B|109| M: [i think] [you] [mean] family . 
A|110| B: [yeah] . 
B|111| M: [what] [if] [they] [can't] afford [it] ? 
A|112| B: [me] too . 
B|113| M: [i [don't] have] any money . 
A|114| B: uh-huh . 
B|115| M: [you] 
A|116| B: uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [the] appeal [is that] [it] takes [a year] [or] [so] [to get] [to] [the] next appeal . 
A|118| B: [yeah] . 
B|119| M: i'll 
A|120| B: [yeah] .
