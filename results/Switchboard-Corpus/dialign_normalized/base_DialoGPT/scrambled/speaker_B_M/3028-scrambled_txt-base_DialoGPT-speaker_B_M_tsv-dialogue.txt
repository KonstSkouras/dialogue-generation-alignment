A|74| B: [so] [if] [you] look at russia [and] [what's] happened over [there] [i think] [the] change [in] communism [was] as [a] result [of the] economic problems _that they_ were experiencing . [and] [of] course [i] look at [the] economic problems [in the] united states [right] _now_ . [one] [of the] things [you] wonder [is] [what] [that's] _going to_ do [to] us .
