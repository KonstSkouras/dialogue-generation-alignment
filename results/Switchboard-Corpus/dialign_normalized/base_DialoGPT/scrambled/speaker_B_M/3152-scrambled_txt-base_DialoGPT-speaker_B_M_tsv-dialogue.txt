A|74| B: right . 
B|75| M: [i'm] sorry [but] [how] [do] [you] [think they] [do] [that] ?

B|91| M: what's [that] ? 
A|92| B: um as far as [the] new hires [i] [i] hired [on] [just] early enough [that] [i] [i] missed [it .] um where [the] new hires [were] concerned _but uh_ [not] nobody no [i don't think] anybody questions [that] um testing someone as [a] as [a] precondition [to] being hired [but] um [for] [the] conditions [that] [for] our employment [to] change while [you're] [on the] job [that's] [i] [i don't [know] that] [that's] where [i think] [that] most people get upset [. it's] [uh] [you know] [it] [it's] changing [the] rules _in the_ middle _of the_ game basically and [uh] [it's] [just] [it] [it's a] really tough question 
B|93| M: [i'm] [not] [sure] [what] [you] [mean] by [that] [but] [i don't think] [i've] [ever] [seen] [any] [of] those . 
A|94| B: [that] [uh] 
B|95| M: [but _uh] uh_ ... 
A|96| B: um she [was] ambulatory and so [there] _was a_ lesser care . [uh] then she [got] [uh uh] hip broken and then [uh] she wasn't as ambulatory so [they] [were] almost [you know] [to] [the] point [of] _saying_ she [can't] [be] here [anymore .]
