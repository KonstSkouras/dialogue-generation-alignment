A|40| B: [oh .] 
B|41| M: [i]

B|43| M: [but] [it's] [a] [good] [thing] !

B|55| M: [you] don 
A|56| B: uh-huh [. _i] was_ [just saying that] _way_ _what_ _they're_ [saying] [is] _that they_ [can't] [get] _people_ [to] turn themselves [in] then . _and_ [so] we _have to_ _go_ through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's guilty . 
B|57| M: [i have _a] lot of_ _stuff _you_ can_ _use_ . 
A|58| B: [oh] super . 
B|59| M: _what do you_ [do] ? 
A|60| B: [but] she seems [to] . 
B|61| M: [i'm] [pretty] _sure_ [it's] [a] big _deal_ . 
A|62| B: we [do] 
B|63| M: [i don't know] _are you ?_ 
A|64| B: _yeah_ [i] eat [that] [i] [think] _i've_ eaten fish [like] twice since [. i] used [to] eat [a lot of] fish too _but i_ [just] tried [to] cut [it] all out [for] [a] while _and_ see [what] happens . 
B|65| M: [that's] [a lot of] money . 
A|66| B: _yeah ._ _yeah ._ 
B|67| M: [that's] _what i_ thought . 
A|68| B: _and_ [what do _you] have_ . 
B|69| M: [i'm] _sure_ [the] insurance company [has] [some] insurance [to] _deal_ _with_ [that .] 
A|70| B: [oh] _yeah_ 
B|71| M: _i _know_ what_ [you] _mean _._ but_ [if] [they're] _going to try_ [to] [do] [that they] should [do] [it] . 
A|72| B: _yeah_ [it's] usually beautiful up [there] isn't [it] ? 
B|73| M: ohhhh [uh] _yeah yeah ._ 
A|74| B: [oh] [yeah .] _well_ _most_ [of] [my] camping _i haven't_ done much since _i was_ [a] kid [but] [uh] we'd basically take [the] tent up _in the_ sierras _and_ [uh] usually [just] camp near [some] stream or [some] lake . 
B|75| M: _i am_ uhh [i'm] [not] . 
A|76| B: [i] [do] too [. i] _think i_ [think] _a lot of people_ [a lot] [more] _people_ volunteer [than] [than] [uh] [than] we [than] [get] credit _for it_ as _you know_ [like] [in] hospitals _and_ [uh] _and_ [the] shelters _and_ [stuff] [like] [that .] _and_ _even_ [if] _it is_ [a] couple times [a] [year] [like] [at] [the] holidays [i mean] [at] least [they're] getting out _and_ _doing_ [it] _and you know_ helping helping out [. i] _think that's_ [good] _and_ 
B|77| M: [well] _i guess_ [that's] [the] law 
A|78| B: uh-huh . 
B|79| M:  ... [and [and] you know] 
A|80| B: [and] [this] eventually _things_ [just] went too far 
B|81| M: [do you] [think that's] [how] [it] _works_ ? 
A|82| B: [and] all [the] civil rights _people_ [are] up arms _about_ [it] [you [know] .] 
B|83| M: [that's] _what [i_ was] [saying] . 
A|84| B: _but [i_ don't know] [that] _there's a_ real [uh] 
B|85| M: [you] [would] love morocco . 
A|86| B: _it's hard to_ find stick shift cars _anymore ._ 
B|87| M: [it's] awwwwwww . 
A|88| B: _i've never_ _seen_ [you] before _who [are_ you ?] 
B|89| M: [it's] _okay_ . 
A|90| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
B|91| M:  ... [you know] [i'm] [not] _sure_ . 
A|92| B: [yeah _.] i don't think_ [that] [some] _people_ _i don't think_ [have] [uh] [a] [year] [in] [them to] volunteer [if [you] [know] [what] [i] [mean] .] [they're] [not] worth [it] 
B|93| M: _they _are_ ._ 
A|94| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] _things_ [that] _we're_ trying [to] worry _about_ [you know] protecting these _people_ from we [just] [don't] protect [them] . 
B|95| M: [that .] 
A|96| B: uh-huh . 
B|97| M: _you're_ _right ._ 
A|98| B: [yeah] _it is_ [a] tough [question] . 
B|99| M: [it] 
A|100| B: [right .] [well] [the] reason _why_ we play over [there] [is] because its where since we _are a_ garland resident [they] gave _us_ [a] special [deal] where _you can get_ [uh] ten rounds [of] golf [for] [a] hundred dollars [yeah] [a] hundred dollars cause _it is_ half price [what] [the] normal green fees [are .] 
B|101| M: [um] ... [um] ... [what] ? 
A|102| B: [right] [yeah .] 
B|103| M: should [be] _paid_ ? 
A|104| B: [yeah yeah] [i] [i] [use] [that] [for] [for] rice [and] [for] _when_ [i] cook pasta or something _i'll_ put [a] little bit [of] bouillon [in] [there] [just] [to] give [it] [a] little extra flavor . 
B|105| M:  
A|106| B: [and] _one of the_ congressmen [has] [has] written _in the_ last three years _about_ [a] thousand bad checks . 
B|107| M: [well] [i mean] [there] [are [a] lot of _people] _that_ [are_ a] [part of the] community . 
A|108| B: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: _i am_ 
A|110| B: [and] [that] [was] _the most_ boring place on earth . 
B|111| M: _have you ever_ heard [of the] mountain ? 
A|112| B: uh-huh . 
B|113| M: [no] [i haven't] 
A|114| B: [i guess] [. but] _we're_ [going to try] [that] [and] see [how] [that] [works] . 
B|115| M: [not] [really [.] [i] mean] [i have a] laptop [and] mouse [but i] [can't] [use] [the] mouse [anymore .] 
A|116| B: [i] [like] [it] _better_ [i] [think] . 
B|117| M: [i don't think] [i'll] [ever] [be] able [to] afford [that .] 
A|118| B: _but you know_ _there's_ _there's a lot of_ taxes [you] pay [that] [you're not] _even_ aware [of] [that] [you're] paying [uh] [like] _when you_ buy [a] tire [you] pay [a] federal excise tax . 
B|119| M: yea [i'll] [have a] [better] word [for it] 
A|120| B: [oh] [how] wonderful . 
B|121| M: [i mean] [it] [really] helps . 
A|122| B: [and and] [to] me _you know it's_ [like] [now] [i'm] twenty-two [but i] still feel _you know it's_ [like] [yeah] we _never_ threw [a] football or something 
B|123| M: [i] [can't] [even] [think] [of] [a] [way] [to get] [it] . 
A|124| B: [but] [uh] 
B|125| M:  ... 
A|126| B: [and] [i have a] sister-in-law _who_ [is] _who_ [works] _in the_ fort worth school district . 
B|127| M: [well] [there's] plenty [of] [full] employment [in the] [us] . 
A|128| B: [so] [it's] got real high ceilings on half [the] [house] [and] [the] other half [is] [just] standard sized ceilings . 
B|129| M: [why] [do you] [think] ? 
A|130| B: bye . 
B|131| M:  
A|132| B: [yeah .] 
B|133| M: [not] [in] dallas texas . 
A|134| B: [what] _about_ [you ?] 
B|135| M: [it's not] [like] [it's hard to] 
A|136| B: [well] 
B|137| M: [i've never] heard [of] [a] group [of people] [doing] [that .] 
A|138| B: [that's] [right [.] i] [even] had friends _when_ [i was] [going to] college _who_ _were in_ [uh] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally [um] provide medicine [to] their family family members [and] friends certain medicines [were] [were] legal [now] [i] [i] [i] believe [you know] _any_ [of the] _any_ [of the] ones we [would] we [would] [be] tested [for] wouldn't [be] on those lists 
B|139| M: _okay_ [. so] [you're not] _huh_ ? 
A|140| B: [well] [what] _about_ an innocent person _who_ happens [to] [have] _been_ found guilty ? 
B|141| M: [the] . [the] . dogs . [are .] [good .] 
A|142| B: [i mean] usually [you know] [you] _go_ [to] [work] before [they're] awake or as [they're] getting up [for] school [and you] [get] [home] [and] [it's] already dark unless [it's] summer _time_ [you [know] .] [and] [even] [in] summer _time_ sometimes [you] [get] [home] [so] late [that] [there's] [you know] [you can't] [do] anything [with] [them] . 
B|143| M: [it's] [been] [a] long [time] . 
A|144| B: [and] [they are] [just] [a lot] [more] mature [than the] average student 
B|145| M: [this] . 
A|146| B: [no] . 
B|147| M:  ... 
A|148| B: [yeah] [i've] [been] lucky [in] [that] respect [that] [i don't] [uh] [don't] travel too much . 
B|149| M: [um] [i'm] [not] _sure_ [. i don't [think] _i] [know_ what] [you're] talking [about] .

[uh] [and] each [year] [it's] done [a] little bit differently because different [people] serve [in] those roles . 
B|157| M: [so] [why] [are] [they] [so] hostile ? 
A|158| B: _do they_ wind up [with] [more] red tape [and] [more] problems then ? [yeah yeah .] 
B|159| M: [i'm] gonna [go] [with] dogs . 
A|160| B: [okay] [yeah .] [well] [you] [just] [do]

A|174| B: [i don't know] 
B|175| M: [i mean] [you] [could] [say] [that] [about] [any] [job] . 
A|176| B: [if you] compare [the] [like] [the] [people that] [could] [have] [that] [could] [have] sent their [kids] [to] private schools [and] [the] [people that] [you know] [the] [people that] [uh] did send their [kids] [to] private schools . 
B|177| M: [oh] [there's [a lot of] people] [who are] dying [we're] [just] losing [some] .

[and] then [with] others [that are] kind [of] half [way] between [and] [stuff] [. so] [i've] _seen_ [a] wide range [of] both [you know] nonsalary type benefits [and] other [stuff [you] know] [like] health care [that's] either fully or partially [paid] [and you know] [some] [have] [like] bonuses [and] others [have] had lots [of] vacation [time] [but] [not] much other types [of] benefits [and] [so] [yeah] _i would_
