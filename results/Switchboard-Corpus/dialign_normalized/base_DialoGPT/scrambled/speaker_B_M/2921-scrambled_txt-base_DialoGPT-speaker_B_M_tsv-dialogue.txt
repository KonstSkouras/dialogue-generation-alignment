[i'm_ [,] i'm] _only_ _about_ _, uh ,_ twelve miles or _so_ from _the_ _, uh ,_ border _of_ washington d c _, and_ montgomery _county_ , maryland _is_ probably _one of the most_ expensive , places [to] , 
B|31| M: _i _know_ [._ i'm] _just saying that_ _he_ _was_ sentenced [to] death . 
A|32| B: _the_ west _part of the_ state _is_ _and_ then _the_ east _part of the_ state [has] got all _the_ bleeding hearts _and_ all _the_ welfare cases _so_ .

A|40| B: [oh .] 
B|41| M: [i] 
A|42| B: [i] [think] , we hope [that] [it] will _be_ _, you know ,_ [some] sort _of_ deterrent or _, you know ,_ an eye [for] an eye type _thing_ , or something [like] _that ._ 
B|43| M: [but] [it's] [a] [good] [thing] !

B|45| M: [i'm] [not] _going to_ answer [that] _question_ , _you're not_ _the same_ guy . 
A|46| B: [i] [, i] shouldn't _say_ innocent , because _i mean ,_ actually [if] _they_ commit [a] crime [that] _they're_ _in [the_ same] circumstances _but ,_

B|53| M: uhhhh . _you're not_ gonna [get] away _with_ _this_ . 
A|54| B: _well ,_ we _live_ _, uh ,_ _pretty_ close , [to] [the] mesquite golf course . 
B|55| M: [you] don 
A|56| B: uh-huh [. _i] was_ [just saying that] _way_ , _what_ _they're_ [saying] [is] [that] _they_ [can't] [get] _people_ [to] turn themselves [in] then . _and_ _so ,_ we _have to_ _go_ through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's guilty . 
B|57| M: [i have _a] lot of_ _stuff_ _you can_ _use_ . 
A|58| B: [oh ,] super . 
B|59| M: _what do you_ [do] ? 
A|60| B: [but] she seems [to] . 
B|61| M: [i'm] [pretty] _sure_ [it's] [a] big _deal_ . 
A|62| B: we [do] 
B|63| M: [i don't know ,] _are you ?_ 
A|64| B: _yeah [,_ i] eat _that [,_ i] [think] _i've_ eaten fish [like] twice since [. i] used [to] eat [a lot of] fish , too _, but i_ [just] tried [to] cut [it] all out [for] [a] while _and_ see [what] happens . 
B|65| M: [that's] [a lot of] money . 
A|66| B: _yeah ._ _yeah ._ 
B|67| M: [that's] _what i_ thought . 
A|68| B: _and_ [what do _you] have_ . 
B|69| M: [i'm] _sure_ [the] insurance company [has] [some] insurance [to] _deal_ _with_ [that .] 
A|70| B: [oh _,] yeah_ 
B|71| M: _i _know_ what_ [you] _mean _._ but_ [if] [they're] _going to try_ [to] [do] [that [,] they] should [do] [it] . 
A|72| B: _yeah _,_ it's_ usually beautiful up [there] isn't [it] ? 
B|73| M: ohhhh [, uh _,] _yeah ,_ yeah ._ 
A|74| B: [oh [,] yeah .] _well ,_ _most_ [of] [my] camping _, i haven't_ done much since _i was_ [a] kid _but [,_ uh ,] we'd , basically , take [the] tent up _in the_ sierras _and [,_ uh ,] usually [just] camp near [some] stream or [some] lake . 
B|75| M: _i am_ , uhh [, i'm] [not] . 
A|76| B: [i] [do] , too [. i] [think] [, i] [think] _a lot of people_ , [a lot] [more] _people_ volunteer [than] , [than] [, uh ,] [than] we , [than] [get] credit _for it_ as _, you know ,_ [like] [in] hospitals _and [,_ uh _,] and_ [the] shelters _and_ [stuff] [like] [that .] _and_ _even_ [if] _it is_ [a] couple times [a] [year] [like] [at] [the] holidays [, i mean] [at] least [they're] getting out _and_ _doing_ [it] _and _you_ know ,_ helping , helping out [. i] _think that's_ [good] _and ,_ 
B|77| M: [well] _i guess_ [that's] [the] law 
A|78| B: uh-huh . 
B|79| M:  ... _and , _and_ , you know ,_ 
A|80| B: [and] [this] , eventually _things_ [just] went too far 
B|81| M: [do you] [think that's] [how] [it] _works_ ? 
A|82| B: [and] all [the] civil rights _people_ [are] up arms _about_ _it [,_ you [know] .] 
B|83| M: [that's] _what [i_ was] [saying] . 
A|84| B: _but [i_ don't know] [that] _there's a_ real [, uh ,] 
B|85| M: [you] [would] love morocco . 
A|86| B: _it's hard to_ find stick shift cars _anymore ._ 
B|87| M: [it's] awwwwwww . 
A|88| B: _i've never_ _seen_ [you] before _who [are_ you ?] 
B|89| M: [it's] _okay_ . 
A|90| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
B|91| M:  ... [you know [,] i'm] [not] _sure_ . 
A|92| B: [yeah _.] i don't think_ [that ,] [some] _people_ _i don't think_ [have] [, uh ,] [a] [year] [in] [them to] volunteer [if [you] [know] [what] [i] [mean] .] [they're] [not] worth [it] 
B|93| M: _they _are_ ._ 
A|94| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] _things_ [that] _we're_ trying [to] worry _about_ [, you know ,] protecting these _people_ from , we [just] [don't] protect [them] . 
B|95| M: [that .] 
A|96| B: uh-huh . 
B|97| M: _you're_ _right ._ 
A|98| B: [yeah [,] _it] is_ [a] tough [question] . 
B|99| M: [it] 
A|100| B: [right .] _well ,_ [the] reason _why_ we play over [there] [is] because its where , since we _are a_ garland resident [, they] gave _us_ [a] special [deal] where _you can get_ [, uh ,] ten rounds [of] golf [for] [a] hundred dollars [, yeah ,] [a] hundred dollars cause _it is_ half price [what] [the] normal green fees [are .] 
B|101| M: [um] ... [um] ... [what] ? 
A|102| B: [right] [, yeah .] 
B|103| M: should [be] _paid_ ? 
A|104| B: [yeah [, yeah] [,] i] [, i] [use] [that] [for] [for] rice [and] [for] _when_ [i] cook pasta or something _, i'll_ put [a] little bit [of] bouillon [in] [there] [just] [to] give [it] [a] little extra flavor . 
B|105| M:  
A|106| B: [and] _one of the_ congressmen [has] , [has] written _in the_ last three years _about_ [a] thousand bad checks . 
B|107| M: [well [,] [i mean] ,] [there] [are [a] lot of _people] _that_ [are_ a] [part of the] community . 
A|108| B: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: _i am_ 
A|110| B: [and] [that] [was] _the most_ boring place on earth . 
B|111| M: _have you ever_ heard [of the] mountain ? 
A|112| B: uh-huh . 
B|113| M: [no] [, i haven't] 
A|114| B: [i guess] [. but] _we're_ [going to try] [that [,] and] see [how] [that] [works] . 
B|115| M: [not] [really [.] [i] mean [,] i have a] laptop [and] mouse [, but i] [can't] [use] [the] mouse [anymore .] 
A|116| B: [i] [like] [it] _better_ [, i] [think] . 
B|117| M: [i don't think] [i'll] [ever] [be] able [to] afford [that .] 
A|118| B: _but , you know _,_ there's_ _there's a lot of_ taxes [you] pay [that] [you're not] _even_ aware [of] [that] [you're] paying [, uh ,] [like] _when you_ buy [a] tire [, you] pay [a] federal excise tax . 
B|119| M: yea [, i'll] [have a] [better] word [for it] 
A|120| B: [oh ,] [how] wonderful . 
B|121| M: [i mean [,] it] [really] helps . 
A|122| B: [and , and] [to] me _, you know , it's_ [like [,] now] [i'm] twenty-two [, but i] still feel _, you know , it's_ [like] [yeah ,] we _never_ threw [a] football or something 
B|123| M: [i] [can't] [even] [think] [of] [a] [way] [to get] [it] . 
A|124| B: _but [,_ uh ,] 
B|125| M:  ... 
A|126| B: [and] [i have a] sister-in-law _who_ [is] , _who_ [works] _in the_ fort worth school district . 
B|127| M: [well [,] there's] plenty [of] [full] employment [in the] [us] . 
A|128| B: _so _,_ it's_ got real high ceilings on half [the] [house] [and] [the] other half [is] [just] standard sized ceilings . 
B|129| M: [why] [do you] [think] ? 
A|130| B: bye . 
B|131| M:  
A|132| B: [yeah .] 
B|133| M: [not] [in] dallas , texas . 
A|134| B: [what] _about_ [you ?] 
B|135| M: [it's not] [like] [it's hard to] 
A|136| B: [well ,] 
B|137| M: [i've never] heard [of] [a] group [of people] [doing] [that .] 
A|138| B: [that's] [right [.] i] [even] had friends _when_ [i was] [going to] college _who_ _were in_ [, uh ,] pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally , _um ,_ provide medicine [to] their family family members [and] friends certain medicines [were] , [were] legal [now] [i] [, i] [, i] believe [, you know ,] _any_ [of the] , _any_ [of the] ones we [would] , we [would] [be] tested [for] wouldn't [be] on those lists , 
B|139| M: _okay_ [. so] [you're [not] ,] _huh_ ? 
A|140| B: [well ,] [what] _about_ an innocent person _who_ happens [to] [have] _been_ found guilty ? 
B|141| M: [the] . [the] . dogs . [are .] [good .] 
A|142| B: [i mean] usually [, you know [,] you] _go_ [to] [work] before [they're] awake or as [they're] getting , up [for] school _and you_ [get] [home] [and] [it's] already dark unless [it's] summer _time_ [, you [know] .] [and] [even] [in] summer _time_ , sometimes [you] [get] [home] [so] late [that] [there's] [, you know [,] [you] can't] [do] anything [with] [them] . 
B|143| M: [it's] [been] [a] long [time] . 
A|144| B: [and] [they are] [just] [a lot] [more] mature , [than the] average student 
B|145| M: [this] . 
A|146| B: [no] . 
B|147| M:  ... 
A|148| B: [yeah ,] [i've] [been] lucky [in] [that] respect [that] [i don't] [, uh ,] [don't] travel too much . 
B|149| M: [um [,] i'm] [not] _sure_ [. i don't think] _i [know_ what] [you're] talking [about] . 
A|150| B: [i] [really] [like] those , [in] fact [, i] had [a] harpsichord played [at] [my] wedding . 
B|151| M: _i am_ . 
A|152| B: [and] . 
B|153| M: ohhuh . uhuh . 
A|154| B: uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|155| M: [they can] recycle [, [and] [you] can get] [them] [back] . 
A|156| B: [and] [they] plan [the] reunions , [the] organize [the] [, you know ,] _who_ [is] [going to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot gets [there] , who's [going to] rent [the] tables , who's [going to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware gets turned [back] [to] [the] caterer . [uh [,] and] each [year] [it's] done [a] little bit differently , because different [people] serve [in] those roles . 
B|157| M: [so ,] [why] [are] [they] [so] hostile ? 
A|158| B: _do they_ wind up [with] [more] red tape [, and] [more] problems then ? [yeah , yeah .] 
B|159| M: [i'm] gonna [go] [with] dogs .

A|174| B: [i don't know] 
B|175| M: [i mean [,] you] [could] [say] [that] [about] [any] [job] . 
A|176| B: [if you] compare [the] , [like] [the] [people that] [could] [have] _, that_ [could] [have] sent their [kids] [to] private schools [and] [the] [people [that] [,] you know ,] [the] [people [that] [,] uh ,] did send their [kids] [to] private schools . 
B|177| M: [oh [,] [there's] [a lot of] people] [who are] dying , [we're] [just] losing [some] .

[uh ,] [i've] worked [for] , [for] [for] awhile [and] [they are] [, you know ,] [a] [really] academic type [of] place . [and] then [i've] worked [with] regular [, you know ,] industry type places . [and] then [with] others [that are] kind [of] half [way] between [and] [stuff] [. so] [i've] _seen_ [a] wide range [of] both [, you know ,] nonsalary type benefits [and] other [stuff] [, you know ,] [like] health care [that's] either fully or partially [paid] [and , you know ,] [some] [have] [like] bonuses [and] others [have] had lots [of] vacation [time] [but] [not] much other types [of] benefits [and] [so [,] yeah [,] _i] would_ 
B|181| M: [i would] . 
A|182| B: [um] . wow . 
B|183| M: [what] ?
