B|65| M: [i] ' 
A|66| B: uh-huh _yeah ._

A|70| B: _and they_ _would_ [, [you] _know] [,_ i [,] i] picked off [like] twenty [of] _them_ [and ,] 
B|71| M: _i don't _know ,_ _it's_ just_ been raining _for a_ while .

B|81| M: [i] 
A|82| B: [i] [mean] [they] _go_ _right_ [back] where [they] came from . 
B|83| M: [i think] [it _was] _a_ lot_ [more] _than_ [that .] 
A|84| B: [and] _then_ put [that] [back] [in the] saucepan ? 
B|85| M: [it's , it's] . 
A|86| B: _then_ [they] put _them_ [back] [in] jail [, _and] they get_ _out_ [, and] [and] [more] [and] [more] innocent [people] _are_ hurt or killed 
B|87| M:  ... [well ,] _good ._ 
A|88| B: [and] [i] [always] wonder whether _there_ _are_ [people] _who_ [know] [a lot] _about_ every _area_ disagreeing _with_ _them_ on everything , or , or _what's_ going on 
B|89| M: [i] [have] [no] idea .

B|101| M: heh 
A|102| B: [yeah ,] [if they] really [can] _, um , [i_ think] [the] [the] biggest problem _i've got_ _is_ , _is_ forcing [it] on someone after they've already agreed [to] [the] terms [of] employment . 
B|103| M: [is] [that] [a] single window ? 
A|104| B: "and [i] asked _him_ [, i] [got] [to] talking [to] _him_ [, i] _said_ _, well ,_ [how] [is] his nephew _doing_ .
