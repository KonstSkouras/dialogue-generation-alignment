B|63| M: [you're] . 
A|64| B: _well [i_ think] _that's_ true [and] _i uh_ _now_ _we_ generally [don't] buy [a] warranty because [you] [think [you] know] at least _for [the_ first] couple [of] years [nothing] _should_ _go_ wrong _with_ _it ._ 
B|65| M: [i] ' 
A|66| B: uh-huh _yeah ._ 
B|67| M: [that] cat _was_ [just] too cute . 
A|68| B: [and] somebody will find [a] _way_ [to] make _money_ at _it ._ 
B|69| M: [i [uh] i] 
A|70| B: _and they_ _would_ [you know] [i] [i] picked off [like] twenty [of] _them_ [and] 
B|71| M: _i don't _know_ _it's_ just_ been raining _for a_ while . 
A|72| B: [it] seems [to be] [a] disproportionate number [of] blacks [you know] [that] _get_ into [the] system .

B|79| M: [well i] [like] [to] photograph _things_ . 
A|80| B: [and] _then_ [people] _would_ _would_ [know] [that] _it was_ going [to] cost _them money_ [to] [not] sort their trash . 
B|81| M: [i] 
A|82| B: [i] [mean] [they] _go_ _right_ [back] where [they] came from . 
B|83| M: [i think] [it _was] _a_ lot_ [more] _than_ [that .] 
A|84| B: [and] _then_ put [that] [back] [in the] saucepan ? 
B|85| M: [it's it's] . 
A|86| B: _then_ [they] put _them_ [back] [in] jail _and they get_ _out_ [and] [and] [more] [and] [more] innocent [people] _are_ hurt or killed 
B|87| M:  ... [well] _good ._ 
A|88| B: [and] [i] [always] wonder whether _there_ _are_ [people] _who_ [know] [a lot] _about_ every _area_ disagreeing _with_ _them_ on everything or or _what's_ going on 
B|89| M: [i] [have] [no] idea . 
A|90| B: _yeah ._ 
B|91| M: [yeah .] 
A|92| B: uh-huh .

B|101| M: heh 
A|102| B: [yeah] [if they] really [can] _um [i_ think] [the] [the] biggest problem _i've got_ _is_ _is_ forcing [it] on someone after they've already agreed [to] [the] terms [of] employment . 
B|103| M: [is] [that] [a] single window ? 
A|104| B: "and [i] asked _him_ [i] [got] [to] talking [to] _him_ [i] _said_ [well] [how] [is] his nephew _doing_ . ""well [i don't know] [i] haven't talked [to] _my_ brother [in] three years .
