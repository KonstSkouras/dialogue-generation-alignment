B|81| M:  ... 
A|82| B: [and] [uh] [it's] [it's] tragic [that] [you know] when [people] _live_ [so] long [that] [they] [uh] [don't have a] [really] [don't have a] place _to_ [go] . 
B|83| M: [i was] [just] wondering 
A|84| B: [no] [they] [don't] . 
B|85| M: [what] [does] [a] college 
A|86| B: huh . 
B|87| M: [i] 
A|88| B: [so] five bedrooms [and] two living two family 
B|89| M: how _do you_ ? 
A|90| B: instead [of] being watching [the] missiles [and] being glued _to_ [the] tube or whatever . [uh] [and] _because of_ [that] [we] began towards [the] middle [and] _of the_ war [i] guess about two [and] [a] half or three weeks [in] [we] began _to_ restrict our news almost deliberately _where_ [we] [would] [uh] watch [uh] fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our _time_ which [would be] national news or our local news . [we] [would] watch c n n until six thirty then [we] [would] watch [uh] [a] rotating network news [of] either [uh] [a] b c c b s or n b c _and we_ [we] sort [of] [just] rotated around [the] dial each night [a] different one . 
B|91| M: [i don't] [think] [it's] [so] [much] [a] punishment [as] [it] is [a] process [of] execution . 
A|92| B: [do] [do you] put [it] [in the] refrigerator then or 
B|93| M: [yeah] [and we] never throw [a] football [but] [we] throw . 
A|94| B: [and] [i know] [a lot of] [people] [it would] [would] solve [the] convenience [problem] if [they] [had] curbside pickup [and] some communities [are] trying _to_ [do] [that] now . [and] [i think] [that] maybe if [they] only charged for [the] garbage [that] [you] [did] [not] sort [and] [have] set up for [recycling] 
B|95| M: [where] [do you] [live] ? 
A|96| B: uh-huh . [well] [i'm] [a] little different [than] other [people] [because] [i don't have] benefits [with] my [job] . 
B|97| M: [i _know] ._ 
A|98| B: [so] [it] [was] real nice . 
B|99| M: [what] ? 
A|100| B: [and] [uh] [and] [that] [would] make any parent feel [good] [and] bad [at] [the] same _time_ [you know] 
B|101| M: [that] sounds [great] ! 
A|102| B: [right .] 
B|103| M: [so] . 
A|104| B: uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [they] [do] [it all] [the] [time] [. [i] don't] [think] [they're] afraid [of the] consequences . 
A|106| B: my husband [got] his big garage . [he] [we [have] a] three [car] garage [that he] has [a] big work area [in] 
B|107| M: [right .] 
A|108| B: [well] [she] didn't _want to_ cook for herself anymore . 
B|109| M: [so] [the] reason [you] [don't] [want to] [be] [there] is [because [of] the] cart ? 
A|110| B: [right [.] i] guess [what] [they] [what] [they] were talking about here [was] [uh] [was] reducing [the] garbage collection [in] order [to] make [that] up or something [you [know] .] 
B|111| M: [but] ... [you know] ... [things] [like [that] .] 
A|112| B: [you know] there's nothing [in] [there] [that] can wrap around [the] [the] [uh] rollers or anything . [it] seems [like] [a] [really] [good] answer [to] portable music [that] [you] can choose . 
B|113| M: [i'm not] [so] worried 
A|114| B: um [that's] [possible] [i] guess .
