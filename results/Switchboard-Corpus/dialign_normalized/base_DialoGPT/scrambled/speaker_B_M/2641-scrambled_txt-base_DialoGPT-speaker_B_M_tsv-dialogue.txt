B|47| M: [is] _it _,_ not_ [to] [you] personally ? 
A|48| B: [i] [mean] [it's] [like] nobody messes [with] her mamma . 
B|49| M: _i'd_ throw _it ,_ _but _i_ don't [think_ _you] can_ throw [a] . 
A|50| B: right _, that's_ true . or [even] [have] [you] _ever_ seen where [they] , they'll [take] [a] watermelon [and] [just] _cut_ [the] top [out of] [it] _and then_ hollow [that] [out] , _and then_ _put_ [the] fruit [in the] watermelon [that] [is] _really_ neat . 
B|51| M: [oh , well , that's]

B|65| M: [how] many daughters [do you] own ? 
A|66| B: _i think_ _for_ serial murder [it] [is] warranted because _if_ [a] person _who_ _would_ [do] something [like] [that] [in] cold blood , 
B|67| M: did someone actually play [it ?] 
A|68| B: [yeah] . [that's] true . 
B|69| M: [oh] ? [i think] [that] _was the_ _last_ [job] [i] _ever had_ . 
A|70| B: [but [i] think] _we_ _would_ make [a] bigger investment [in] [kids] , we'd [have] fewer decisions [to] make . down [the] road _, you_ _know ._ 
B|71| M: _i [know_ .] 
A|72| B: [all] [of] her animals [that] she [ever had] were adopted .

A|74| B: [i] [that] true _, yeah_ . [yeah ,] she's [even] got , she's got _one_ dog now [and] [the] two cats [and] her dog _there_ [is ,] [is] basically [a] reject , somebody [had] bought [him] , [and] wanted [him] . 
B|75| M: nah _, yeah ,_ 
A|76| B: [and] _, uh _,_ _the_ one_ _, _the_ one_ boy _, the_ house [they] bought [is] completely livable . _they didn't_ [have] _to do_ much [to] _it ._ 
B|77| M: [you] . 
A|78| B: [people] _go_ , [oh , well ,] [i'll] [just] _go_ buy [it ,] _put_ [it] _on_ credit [and] they'll pay [it] off . 
B|79| M: [yeah ,] [but] _if [you_ don't] [feel] [it [,] [you] _don't] know_ [how] [to] [feel] . 
A|80| B: [i _think] _it_ would be_ _really_ . _really_ great . 
B|81| M: [what] ? 
A|82| B: uh-huh [, it] _really_ could , [and] _, uh ,_ _then_ , [how] , sometimes , [how] [the] media will blow [things] [out of] proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] _good_ [and] dead , [and] [they] keep dragging [it] _on_ , [and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an election _for_ [the] _guy_ [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [you] , 
A|84| B: [oh ,] [is] [that] right ? 
B|85| M: [i] [go] [to] school [in] turkey . 
A|86| B: uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|87| M:  
A|88| B: [yes] . 
B|89| M: [i'm] [just] [not] _sure_ [how] [it would be] financially wise [to do] _that ._ 
A|90| B: [all] right . 
B|91| M: [i think you] [mean] [the one] [that] [was] [on the] news [for] years . 
A|92| B: [yeah _,] [i don't_ think] _we_ , 
B|93| M: [i'm] _going_ back [to] [the] future . 
A|94| B: [and] boy [that] [thing] screams now . 
B|95| M: [well , we] _are_ [a] [very] small [country .] 
A|96| B: [and] [the] cardinals were kind [of] [like the] [in] fact [they] were _doing_ better than [the] cowboys , [and] [the] cowboy , cowboys came [on] strong at [the] end [of the] season , [and] [the] cardinals got killed by [the] cowboys , _so_ . 
B|97| M: every week 
A|98| B: [and] [i] [do] [get] tired [of that] [but] _, uh _, i_ don't know_ _, [i don't_ think] [i'd] want [to] change _it ._ 
B|99| M:  
A|100| B: uh-huh . 
B|101| M: [so] ? 
A|102| B: right , right , right . [and] [you] _really_ [have] [to] make _, uh ,_ quite [a] bit [of] money [. the] wife [doesn't] make [it] worth [it ,] [with] [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|103| M: [i] am [the one] [who] sings _, my_ son . 
A|104| B: [yeah] . makes [you] wish [that] [had] _, uh ,_ still [had] indentured servitude , [for] _this_ sort [of] _thing ._ 
B|105| M: [i [,] uh , i] don t [know .] 
A|106| B: [you] [know] , [to get] into [the] economics [of] [things] [, uh ,] because [if] [they] wheel somebody into [a] courtroom [and] [the] jury's heart goes [out] [to] [that] person [and] [they do] [one] [of] these mega awards [, it] _really_ [, you] [know] , ultimately [is] [not] penalizing [the] person [that] [they're] [trying] [for] [get] away . 
B|107| M: ok . _so ,_ what's [the] next [question] ? 
A|108| B: [well [,] yeah [,] [i] think] [a lot of] times , [if you] [get] [a] brand name _uh , you_ [know] , [if] _it's a_ , _a good_ brand , 
B|109| M: [you] _can't_ [really] [cut] back [on the] use [of the] market .

B|113| M: [oh .] [i] am ? 
A|114| B: [but] by [the] _time_ [you] [get] done [you] feeling [really] terrific . 
B|115| M: [i] love [it ,] [but] [i'm] [not] _sure_ [if] [i'm] _going_ [to] enjoy [it .] 
A|116| B: [that's] great .
