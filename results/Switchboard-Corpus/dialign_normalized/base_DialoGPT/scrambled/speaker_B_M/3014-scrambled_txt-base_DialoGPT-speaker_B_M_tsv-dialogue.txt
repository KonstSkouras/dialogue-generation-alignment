A|44| B: [and] _you _know_ ._ [uh] [and] [the] reason _i was_ picked [it] [back] _up_ [was in] light [of] _all the_ [uh] [well] [when] [they] found [the] [uh] [the] airplanes on [the] [in the] atlantic thinking [they] were flight nineteen . [and] _i don't know_ [if [you] are] familiar [with] [that] [at] _all_ [but] _it's_ [uh] flight nineteen [was] _one_ _of the_ [uh] [was] [a] [a] collection [of] [a] flight [of] five navy adventures [at] [the] end [of] world war two . right after world war two [and they] were [they] were lost [and] [uh] 
B|45| M: yea . huh .

B|51| M: [but] _they are_ [a] part [of the] economy ... 
A|52| B: although [i] claim florida as [my] home [now] [uh] [i] _have_ two sons living down there [but] [i] also _have_ two sons living elsewhere _one_ [in] tennessee _one_ [in] mississippi . 
B|53| M: [it was] 
A|54| B: [i think] _it's_ [too] easy _for_ _them_ . 
B|55| M: [but] _and and_ . 
A|56| B: _and so_ [now] [they're] [going] [to] [get] even . 
B|57| M: [i [know] _.] the_ majority [do] 
A|58| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [no] [because you] [don't] [have _a] choice_ .

B|61| M: [you] can [eat] [the] [chicken] rice 
A|62| B: [yeah] [well] [of] course [in the] [uh] [i think] [you] probably noticed [in the] discount stores [and] places [in the] hair sprays we're [not] seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything [is] [in the] pump squirt 
B|63| M: uhh [uh] [interesting .] 
A|64| B: [and] [i] ended _up_ getting _one_ [that] [uh] came out [of] [a] [a] [a] hunting stock [because] [i] wanted _one_ [that] could still perform like [a] retriever did .

B|69| M: [oh yeah] ? [uh] huh ? 
A|70| B: [but] [uh] [i think] [that] as [far] as quality [of] food goes [the] some [of the] most expensive places i've [been] _had_ [the] [the] [really] [the] [the] worst quality [of] food . 
B|71| M: [i'm] _a bit_ confused .

B|83| M: [they're [all] the] best [so] [that's] [all] [that] matters . 
A|84| B: [yeah] [yeah [.] well] [to] some extent [if] [they] would [do] something [with] some [of] those [people] . [but] [that] seems [to] be [a] good way [to] [get] off [for] [a lot of] _them_ [too] . 
B|85| M: [so] [uh] 
A|86| B: [do [you] ?]

A|98| B: [well] [they are] [they are] [the] ultimate dog [to] [have] _around_ _kids_ [so] long as your kid [is] [not] scared [of] _a big_ dog [because] [i had a] retriever actually [i had a] retriever irish setter cross . which [is] [a] [really] [nice] animal 
B|99| M: state [of the] art . 
A|100| B: [and] _you've_ [a choice] [of] [where] [you] want [to] [go .]

B|125| M: [we] [are] [never] cheering [for the] broncos . 
A|126| B: [you] could be responsible [for] [that] yourself . 
B|127| M: [we] [got] [it .] 
A|128| B: okay [and and] [in] [in] his league [do they] [have] like [a] pitcher or [do they] [have a] standing ball or [a] machine or [what] ?
