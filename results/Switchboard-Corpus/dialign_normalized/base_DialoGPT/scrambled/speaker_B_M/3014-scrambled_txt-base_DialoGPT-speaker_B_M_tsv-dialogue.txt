A|42| B: [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|43| M: hmmm ... [i'm] [not] _sure_ [i'm] _too_ _far_ [in .] 
A|44| B: _and [,_ _you] _know_ ._ [uh _,] and_ [the] reason _i was_ , picked [it] [back] _up_ [was in] light [of] _all the_ [, uh ,] [well] [when] [they] found [the] [, uh _,] the_ airplanes on [the] , [in the] atlantic , thinking [they] were flight nineteen . [and] _i don't know_ [if [you] are] familiar [with] [that] [at] _all_ [but] _it's_ [, uh ,] flight nineteen [was] _one_ _of the_ [, uh ,] [was] [a] , [a] collection [of] [a] flight [of] five navy adventures [at] [the] end [of] world war two . right after world war two _, [and_ they] were , [they] were lost _and [,_ uh ,] 
B|45| M: yea . huh . 
A|46| B: [that's] rather _interesting ._ 
B|47| M: [i'm] 
A|48| B: [so] [now] [the] tickets even [got] lower than [the] lowest _one_ last _year ._ 
B|49| M: [what] happened ? 
A|50| B: [and] [the] _man_ said , [that] [, _you] know ,_ [if] [it] weren't _for the_ fact [that] [he] would [go] [to] jail , [that] [he] would eliminate this person himself . _and then_ [go] [to] mcdonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] [not] thing [a] thing , [think] [a] thing about [it .] 
B|51| M: [but] _they are_ [a] part [of the] economy ... 
A|52| B: although [i] claim florida as [my] home [now] [, uh [,] i] _have_ two sons living down there [but] [i] also _have_ two sons living elsewhere , _one_ [in] tennessee , _one_ [in] mississippi . 
B|53| M: [it was] 
A|54| B: [i think] _it's_ [too] easy _for_ _them_ . 
B|55| M: _but _,_ and , and_ . 
A|56| B: [and _,] so_ [now] [they're] [going] [to] [get] even . 
B|57| M: [i [know] _.] the_ majority [do] 
A|58| B: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [no _,] because_ [you] [don't] [have _a] choice_ . 
A|60| B: inhaled [so much] [of] [it] , uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [you] can [eat] [the] [chicken] rice 
A|62| B: _yeah ,_ [well ,] [of] course [in the] [, uh [,] [i] think] [you] probably noticed [in the] discount stores [and] places , [in the] hair sprays we're [not] seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything [is] [in the] pump squirt , 
B|63| M: uhh [, uh ,] [interesting .] 
A|64| B: [and] [i] ended _up_ getting _one_ [that] [, uh ,] came out [of] [a] , [a] , [a] hunting stock [because] [i] wanted _one_ [that] could still perform like [a] retriever did . 
B|65| M: drug test 
A|66| B: [i] remember food 
B|67| M: [he's] [been in] power [for] [over] [a] [year .] 
A|68| B: [a] lexus [, uh ,] s c three hundred maybe . something on [that] order . 
B|69| M: [oh yeah] ? [uh] huh ? 
A|70| B: [but [,] uh [,] [i] think] [that] as [far] as quality [of] food goes [the] some [of the] most expensive places i've [been] _had_ [the] [the] , [really] [the] _, the_ worst quality [of] food . 
B|71| M: [i'm] _a bit_ confused .

B|73| M: [he] sighs . 
A|74| B: [the] _kids_ , [they are] [real] [people] [and [they] are] [interesting] [and ,] [they] , [they] [have] _all_ their own activities [and ,] um [, [i] think] as parents [we] [really] enjoy _them_ [in] , [in] our personal situation our children [have] [not] yet decided [to] rebel 
B|75| M: [he's] _an old_ [man] . 
A|76| B: _yeah ,_ exactly .

A|82| B: [because] since [i'm] [an] international student , [they] want [to] send me [back] [to] argentina . 
B|83| M: [they're [all] the] best [, so] [that's] [all] [that] matters . 
A|84| B: _yeah [,_ yeah [.] well ,] [to] some extent [if] [they] would [do] something [with] some [of] those [people] . [but] [that] seems [to] be [a] good way [to] [get] off [for] [a lot of] _them_ [too] . 
B|85| M: [so] [uh]

B|97| M: wait , how ? 
A|98| B: [well ,] [they are] , [they are] [the] ultimate dog [to] [have] _around_ _kids_ [so] long as your kid [is] [not] scared [of] _a big_ dog [, because] [i had a] retriever , actually [i had a] retriever irish setter cross . which [is] [a] [really] [nice] animal 
B|99| M: state [of the] art . 
A|100| B: [and] _you've_ [a choice] [of] [where] [you] want [to] [go .]

A|110| B: _i ,_ i've , _one_ thing , [when] , [when] [i] [have] run [and] jogged [, uh ,] i've always enjoyed doing [it] [by] myself [and [, and] ,] [not] [with] [the] sense [that] [it was] [, [uh ,] uh ,] chore or something [that] _i was_ having [to] [do] [, _i] ,_ i've [really] enjoyed [just] [the] activity [and [,] uh [,] i] write software [, uh ,] as [far] as [the] job [and so] getting out [and] being active [, uh ,] [is] [, [uh ,] uh ,] helps out [. the] _, it's_

A|124| B: reduce [the] violence [in the] prisons [. i think] [that's] its only purpose [is] , [is] [, [you] know ,] [to] reduce [, uh [,] the] violence [in the] prisons [so] [people] behave themselves [a little] [bit] better [if] [they] [think] [they're] [going] [to] [get] off early . off earlier . 
B|125| M: [we] [are] [never] cheering [for the] broncos .
