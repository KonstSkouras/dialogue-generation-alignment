B|37| M: texas . [you] ? 
A|38| B: [oh] [sure] . 
B|39| M: _i'm not_ saying _it's_ [not] [a] good idea [but] _it's_ [a] terrible idea . 
A|40| B: uh-huh . right [uh] [yeah] _we_ can [get] [uh] [yeah] [if] _we_ [get] someone [in] _there_ like [that] then [you] [know] [they] could make all sorts [of] changes [that] [they] were [you] [know] had enough pull .

B|57| M: [but] [but] 
A|58| B: [i] always take home baked bread . 
B|59| M: _and there was_ [no] language problem . 
A|60| B: [we] were using baby [food] [and there was] so many baby [food] jars kind [of] [what] started [it .]
