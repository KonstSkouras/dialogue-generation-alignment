B|85| M: u uuuuuuuu [uh] 
A|86| B: [and] [uh] [a] lot [of] those people [have] [and] [at] [time] [you] know [they] all knew one another . 
B|87| M: [he] [is] [so] [so] [old] . 
A|88| B: [so] [they] [uh] [it's a] [it's a] whole [different] [uh] kind [of] [thing] there then [uh] 
B|89| M: [the] items [are] random . 
A|90| B: [you] know [in] case [you] know [in] case [you] ever need [to] bail out
