A|54| B: [that's] kind [of] sad . [well ,] anyway . 
B|55| M:  
A|56| B: [but] [i [,] i'm] interested _in_ [a] lot [of] [that , but] _, uh _,_ i have_ got [a] lot [of] books [that] [i [,] i] intend _to_ read [, but] [i have] [not] _been_ able _to_ yet [, [you] know ,] _for_ _one_ reason or another . 
B|57| M: hmmm . [yeah .] _you're_ [. _i] [don't ,_ uh] . 
A|58| B: [like] who knows [, [you] know] . 
B|59| M: [i'd] _say_ [the] pensaclippers _are_ [the] most expensive team [in the] state . 
A|60| B: [yeah] our biggest way [of] saving money [is] then _to_ stop all these deductions , um [, [you] know ,] [is] _to_ , let's [see ,] [now] [, i] forget which way [we] [do] [it] . [we] [don't] list all [the] deductions [and] then [we] get [more] money back [, [you] know ,] at [the] end [of the] year , 
B|61| M: [the] government _is a_ [pretty good] [place] [to] start . 
A|62| B: [well ,] [the] jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him [to] death 
B|63| M: [what] ?

B|65| M: [they're] called'rood 
A|66| B: [and] [so] many people when they put people [in the] nurses home , they never [see] _them_ . 
B|67| M: [i'm] [not] [sure] , [i've] [been] [pretty] depressed _about_ _the last few years_ . 
A|68| B: [and] _, uh ,_ also _, uh ,_ vacation [time] [too] [is a] , [is a] _big_ _one_ _for_ [me] . _uh ,_ [and] _i guess_ support _for_ whatever , whatever other [, [you] know ,] kinds [of] professional activities [you have] at [, [you] know ,] work . 
B|69| M: _why_ , [because] _it's a_ dentist ? 
A|70| B: _if_ [you're] , [like] [i've] [, i] work [with] _, uh ,_ computer systems [a] lot . [so] [it's] kind [of] hard [to] [say] [, [you] know] . _if_ [you're] [, [you] know ,] [a] brick layer , somebody [can] look [and] [see [,] [you] know [,] [well] ,] _yeah [,_ you] laid [, [you] know ,] fifteen thousand bricks today [and] they _were_ all straight [and] your building didn't fall down [, [you] know] _yeah [,_ you] did [a] great job . [but] _if you_ build computer systems , [like] [, [well] , [you] know [,] what] does [that] computer program really [do] [, [you] know] . or , especially _if you_ write [like] papers [, [you] know] . or [do] design studies or [something] . 
B|71| M: [well [,] [i] guess] [it] [was] [the] first [time] [in the] world . 
A|72| B: [well] .

A|74| B: here [in] new york [it's a] lot harder [than] [that [,] uh] 
B|75| M: i'ma 
A|76| B: [and] [it] would be _just_ , 
B|77| M: yes . 
A|78| B: [right] [. oh] [, i] understand

A|82| B: uh-huh . yep , [we] tried [to] convince my grandfather [to] [live] [with] us at several points during [the last few years] [of] his life [, but] [he was] essentially [too] proud [and] [too] independent [so] [that] even though his heart [was] [getting] incredibly weak [and] his knees _were_ going bad [he] lived [in] his own house as long as [he] could 
B|83| M: [well , you] [were] _a little_ [too] [, uh ,] [big] . 
A|84| B: exactly . uh-huh . [uh [,] i don't] [know] [. [i] [,] uh [,] you [,] you] rarely hear [, you] hear , [of] course there's cases [where] someone has [been] put [in] , [in] , [in] [, uh ,] prison [, uh ,] falsely accused [but] [, uh ,] [more] [than] likely [the] people [that] [are] on [the] , [the] jury [know] [what] [they're] doing . [uh _,] i mean_ [you ,] 
B|85| M: [well [,] i have] fun [with] [you] . 
A|86| B: [well] [i don't] mind [that] [too] much

B|89| M: yourself . she's 
A|90| B: [right] . 
B|91| M: [i] 
A|92| B: [but] [it] would still probably be cheaper [with] [the] company helping , our _if_ everybody [, [you] know ,] pulled their own weight [in] [it] . 
B|93| M: _i know_ ! [i've] [been] [to] disneyland ! 
A|94| B: uh-huh . [no ,] even [that [,] that] really [, [i] [think] [,] [i don't] [,] it's] [been] awhile _since_ [i've] looked at , my youngest child [is] eight . [so] [it's] [been] [a little] while _since_ [i've] looked into , actually daycare centers . [but] they [are]

B|101| M: [that's why] [i] always [, uh ,] plan [for] [the] future . 
A|102| B: [and] [i] [do] [like] [them] . [and] [i'd] [like] [to] [have a] compact disc player [in [the] car] . [that] would be , [something] [that] [i] would really [like .]
