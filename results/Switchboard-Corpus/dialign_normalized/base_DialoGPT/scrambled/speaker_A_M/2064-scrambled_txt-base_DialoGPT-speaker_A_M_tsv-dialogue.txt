A|92| A: [i] [mean ,] dallas [is] [a] very marked [up] area , although [right] now _it's a_ lot lower um , [because of] [all] [the] layoffs [and] everything 
B|93| M: [well] 
A|94| A: [so] . _so ,_ if [we] get [what] [we] [what] [we] deserve 
B|95| M: [i] [like] [the] sound [of the] crt's [, and the] crts [are] _nice_ . 
A|96| A: yeah .
