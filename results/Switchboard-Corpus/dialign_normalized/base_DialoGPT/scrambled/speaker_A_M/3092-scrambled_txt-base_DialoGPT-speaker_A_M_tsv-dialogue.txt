B|7| M: [you] 
A|8| A: _yeah_ . they _don't_ _do that_ here . course they pay them [but] they _don't_ _you don't_ [you] or _the insurance_ companies never see _any_ [of] [that] money . 
B|9| M: we're _not_

B|13| M: [well] _there is a_ garage _there ._ 
A|14| A: did [you] scuba dive [there] ? 
B|15| M: [so] we're _all just_ living _off_ [of] _their_ [at] _their_ expense . 
A|16| A: _oh_ _sure_ because if [you] _take_ _it_ into [a] service station they _want to_ charge [you] forty dollars [just] for [uh] freon which only costs [you] about three dollars 
B|17| M: yes [i think] [i] [do] . 
A|18| A: then [i] i'd _love_ _to_ _go_ somewhere _in_ asia [but] i'd _have to_ [have a] tour guide _with_ _me_ _to_ help _with_ _all the_ language _and_ [all] _that ._ 
B|19| M:  
A|20| A: [i] [i] wasn't helping them . [i] worked _with_ them [not] _to_ help them [but] for _my_ own purposes . [i'm] [i'm a] linguist _and i_ _was_ [uh] doing [a] language trying _to_ learn [their] language [a little] bit . _and i_ _actually_ um [i] _mean_ helped them them _in the_ sense [that] they received money for working _with_ _me_ . [but i] didn't [i] didn't [i] wasn't [a] social worker or anything like _that ._ 
B|21| M: uhhh _i think we've_ [all] _been_ _there ._ 
A|22| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|23| M: _and [the_ insurance] _is_ _on_ _her_ . 
A|24| A: _no ._ 
B|25| M: [uh] _how_ _do [you_ _know] that_ ? 
A|26| A: "well [uh] i've had teenagers _and i_ now [have] grandchildren [that] _are_ teenagers _and _i_ don't_ [know that] _it_ might [do] them [a little] bit [of] _good_ _to_ see [the] world from [a] different perspective . [uh] [i think] this ""me"" generation has gone far too far .

B|27| M: _it's_ [probably] [not] [a] bad _idea_ . 
A|28| A: [i think] [that] once [you] _do that_ your children _kind_ [of] develop _the same_ attitudes . [at] least _my_ daughters [have] . they try _to_ teach theirs [not] _to_ get into things instead [of] having _to_ put everything up . [so] [it's] worked _pretty_ [well] . there's _i don't_ really [think] anything's [been] broken . every now [and] then _we _have_ to_ _kind_ [of] _go_ [and] _say_ now _don't_ bother this [you _know] ._ 
B|29| M: h 
A|30| A: because everyone gains from _it ._ 
B|31| M: [oh] . [my] . [god] . hahaha 
A|32| A: _yeah_ [that] [that] would [all] start [at] [at] um [that] would [all] start [at] [at] eight o'clock here [that] wouldn't start [at] seven . _we have_ um [at] seven o'clock _we_ [just] [have] um [the] they'll _play_ [you know] they [have] old reruns [of] cheers or something from seven _to_ seven thirty [and] then something else from seven thirty _to_ eight

B|47| M: why [not] _on the_ weekend ? 
A|48| A: [oh] _yeah_ . [i] _mean [you_ _know] ._ there's [no] place _in the_ house where [you] can stand [and] [not] see four windows . 
B|49| M: [that .] 
A|50| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ . 
B|51| M: [i'm] _going to_ [say] [it .] [the] cats . 
A|52| A: [my] mother [well] _she's_ like seventy-four now . _she_ when _she_ [was] [a] young girl _she_ had [a] beautiful beautiful cousin [that] lived _in_ california [and] _she_ [was] dating this millionaire's son [and] he wanted [to] marry [her] [and] _she_ wouldn't marry him [and] [so] he drove out _in the_ country _one_ day [and] shot them both [and] [uh] 
B|53| M: [i think] [it's] . 
A|54| A: [no] [my] husband does .

B|59| M: [but] ... [the] [company] _is_ still [a] part _of the_ [company] . 
A|60| A: [it was] [just] insane twelve days where we'd [just] stop like [a] city [a] day [and] [you] slept [on the] [train] [at] night . 
B|61| M: [they're] 
A|62| A: _what_ [uh] [is] [there] anything [uh] _that you_ particularly _are_ concerned _with_ _in_ your particular _area_ as far as security [and] [that] sort [of] [thing] ? 
B|63| M: [you're] [the] [one] who's downvoting [me] [i'm] telling [you] [what] [i think] 
A|64| A: _yeah_ _we_ [we've] [been] married for two [and] [a] half years . [we've] [been] trying for about two years [but] [no] luck yet . 
B|65| M:  
A|66| A: [but] [at] _the same_ _time [i_ think] [it] would [do] them [a] world [of] _good_ . 
B|67| M: [i don't] [want _to] make_ [any] promises [but] [i'm] _going _to_ take_ [a] bath [with] [a] bath . 
A|68| A: uh-huh . right . uh-huh . right because [they're] [a] danger [to] everybody else . huh _that's_ interesting . _i have to_ [uh] agree [with] [that .] 
B|69| M:  ... [what] ? 
A|70| A: [i] would [love] [that .] 
B|71| M: _i know ._

A|84| A: uh-huh . 
B|85| M: [i'm] [sure] you'll _be_ happy . 
A|86| A: [so] um [well] [i have] [not] really paid _much_ attention because [i] clock although [i think we've] [probably] [been] talking [at] least ten minutes [so] um if [you] um unless [you] [have] some _other_ things [you] [want to] talk about as having [to] [do] [with] p c 
B|87| M: [no] [it was] [not] . 
A|88| A: [yeah] . [have] [you] ever used [do you] use wordperfect ever ? [have] [you] ever used wordperfect ? or 
B|89| M: [i] 
A|90| A: [well] [i have] this new fondue pot _and i_ [was] [going to] [do] basic cheese fondue _and [i_ have] two different kinds [of] breads [and] some ham _and i_ [was] [going to] try something weird which [you know] when [you] [have] fish au gratin [i] [was] [going [to] make] some [uh] like fish chunks [and] dip [it] [in the] fondue . [i don't] [know] if [it] will come out . 
B|91| M: [i] [do that] [all the] [time] [and] [it] [works] . 
A|92| A: [yeah i know .] 
B|93| M: [i'm a] pilot [and i] work [in the] military [so] . 
A|94| A: [and] there's almost [no] energy there's very [little] energy value [in] _actually_ doing [a] lot [of the] recycling [but] [there is a] lot [of] energy [in] [it] if [you] can burn [it] [and] use [it] produce electricity . 
B|95| M: [do [you] know] _how_ [much] [time [i] have to] wait [to] buy [my] guns ? 
A|96| A: uh-huh . 
B|97| M: [it's] [actually] [pretty] neat . 
A|98| A: [yeah] . [uh] maybe maybe too [a] big social change _that's_ _that's_ maybe for [the] worst [is] [uh] [is] [is] [how] um [the] people's [uh] views [on] [on] relationships has changed [you know] [and] now _we have_ now _we have_ several [you know] _we [have_ to] worry about aids [and] _we [have_ to] worry about [uh] maybe people [are] becoming more aware more more afraid [of] relationships . 
B|99| M: [what] [do you] [mean _you] think_ [it's] [not] [a] [good] [time] 
A|100| A: uh-huh huh . [do [you] think] they _should be_ punished [at] [all] or [uh] like [go] [to] prison [uh] because [they're] [not] really [a] danger [to] society . [it was] almost really self defense isn't [it] [in] [a] case like [that .] 
B|101| M: uhhh [i know .] 
A|102| A: uh-huh . 
B|103| M: [there is] [no] way [you] read [that you] [should be] ashamed . 
A|104| A: [and] [and] [so] [it was] [it was] [a] [much] more intense book than [the] sort [of] flimflam [that] they cast [off] [in the] movie 
B|105| M: [so uh] [do] [we have] [any] [other] food ? 
A|106| A: [yeah] . uh-huh . [so] as [a] family [you] [all just] visited nursing homes or [probably] [in] college station [there] wasn't [a] whole lot [of] choice . 
B|107| M: [yeah] [uh] [that's not] [the same] . 
A|108| A: [so] [i have] this [feeling that] freon [probably] will increase [in] price because [it] [is] something [that] people will [have [to] take] into consideration [and] [say] hey [that's] [that's] right [there .] 
B|109| M: [i know .] 
A|110| A: [yeah] . 
B|111| M:  .
