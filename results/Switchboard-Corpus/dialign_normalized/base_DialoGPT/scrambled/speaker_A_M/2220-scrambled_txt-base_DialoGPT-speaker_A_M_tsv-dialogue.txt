A|30| A: [it's] really , really _pretty_ _. i_ was [a] little kid then [, and] [we] [to] _have , uh ,_ [we] stayed _at_ [some] park [and] _they_ [had a] little [uh ,] mountain man who came down [the] river every night [, and] he would give [a] little talk [about] mountain things . _you know [,_ i think] he wasn't [a] real mountain man [, but] [we] were _pretty_ convinced he was _a full_ , hermit who lived up _in_ , [the] woods , _that_ he'd come _in_ his little log boat down [the] river , 
B|31| M:  
A|32| A: _oh_ , _how_ _funny_ . 
B|33| M:  ... 
A|34| A: [and] then [when i] would come [home] [and] he would leave [, and] [, um] _, so_ [i think] one day one _of_ our kids said _, _you_ know ,_ someone came [home] [and] _they_ said , well , [when] _is_ dad leaving [or] something .

A|48| A: _yeah_ . 
B|49| M: _i have_ [the] receipt _for_ [the] consumsers .

B|53| M: [i] _could_ [probably] [get] [a] tv [in] [the] middle _of a_ city . 
A|54| A: [and] [i think] _that_ _it's just_ _is_ [good] [for] _your_ self-esteem , [for] everything _because_ [when] [you] look better _, you_ feel better [and] _it's just_ [, uh , _i think] it's_ well worth [it] [. _i] just_ demand _that_ _time_ [for] myself . now [i've] learned [to do] _that_ 
B|55| M: ohh . 
A|56| A: _oh_ , out [of] as opposed [to] [the] insurance paying [the] bills ,
