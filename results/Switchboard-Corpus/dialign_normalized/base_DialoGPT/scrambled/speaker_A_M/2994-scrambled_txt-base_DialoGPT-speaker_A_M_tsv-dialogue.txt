[uh ,] it's , [oh [,] right] now [i think] , we [are] about thirty thousand [people] _and_ there's _only_ eight officers [that] patrol for thirty , for [that] amount [of] [people] which [is] _not_ very many . 
B|35| M: [um [,] uh ,] they've [been] _in the_ country . 
A|36| A: _yeah ._

B|39| M: [the] joke [is] [that] [i] live [in] manhattan [, [the] only] place [i] can't live [is] manhattan . 
A|40| A: _and , and_ you're hoping [there] [is] something [that] will cut down [on] _that ._ 
B|41| M: no [, [and] , and] _it ,_ 
A|42| A: _yeah ._ [i] _have_ [a] , [i] had [a] friend [in] college from strasbourg ,

B|51| M: [you [don't] have] [to] wear [it .] 
A|52| A: [oh] . 
B|53| M: [this] 
A|54| A: it's [only] because [they] make [a] big stink over [it .] but [i] [i] guess actually [i] believe [that] [if] somebody wants [to] burn [the] flag [i] guess [that's] their opportunity they're they're they're [right] [in the] sense [of] freedom [of] speech but [i] would never
