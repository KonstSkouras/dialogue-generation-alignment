B|23| M: _it _is_ _the_ first_ [time] , 
A|24| A: _so ,_ 
B|25| M: [i don't think] 
A|26| A: _and_ [it] _usually_ goes through me twice [a] year _and_ _what _you_ do_ [is] take _out_ [the] last letter _you_ wrote [that's] on [the] bottom _and_ put [the] _, your_ _new_ letter on [the] top _, and then_ _that's the_ way _it's_ kept _in_ order _. _and_ then_ , _about_ twice [a] year [then] _you are_ kept _up_ _with_ _what_ [is] _going_ on _and_ _when you_ meet _them_ at [the] reunion _, you do_ _not_ _feel_ _like [,_ i] _do_ _not_ [know] anything _about_ _this_ person . _you [have_ ,] read something _about_ _what_ [is] _going_ on _and_ _about_ _their_ children _and_ [so] forth .

B|31| M: [i] _have no_ _idea ._ 
A|32| A: _that's _,_ that's_ _been_ [my] impression . 
B|33| M: [you] 
A|34| A: [it] really makes [an] effort on , [to] , _do_ _this_ anymore . 
B|35| M: [like [,] a] golden retriever ?

A|46| A: [and] _that's _,_ _you_ know _,_ _that's_ the_ way [they] wanted [to] _do_ [it] _. and_ _he was_ surprised _because_ _he_ thought [there] [was] _going to _be_ a_ _problem_ _because_ _he_ [, uh _,] _you_ know_ _some_ _people_ on [the] case _were_ , _were_ _a little_ hesitant on convicting him on _some_ _of the_ charges _but _i_ mean_ _when_ [it] _all_ came down _, they_ _just_ , within [an] hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|47| M: _i _would_ be_ [so] mad . 
A|48| A: [i don't think] [i would] go through _that_ expense . _one_ other benefit _that_ [you] mentioned [is the] flexible _work_ hours [and] _in my_ previous job [, i] really enjoyed _because they_ had _what_ [was] called flex schedule _where_ [i] [could] go [and] [i] [could] _work_ [, uh ,] nine hour _days_ [and] [have] [like] friday _only_ _work_ four hours
