B|43| M:  
A|44| A: yeah he's [like] [i] thought he _was_ [the] owner [but] [it] turns [out] my mom said [that] he's part owner [but] he must own [the] biggest chunk because [that's] [all] [you] hear [about] [is] _if_ [you] [know] [about] neal bush [i think] [is] his name . 
B|45| M: [you] [mean] [like] [like] recycling ?

[so] [um] [i] don't _know [i_ think] [we have] _just_ become [really] spoiled . [but] [i think] [it's a] nice kind _of_ way [to be] spoiled

B|67| M: [it's] [not] 
A|68| A: [right .] [right .] [and] [you] usually get [what] [you] pay [for] . [we] bought some walkie-talkies [a] couple [of] years ago [for] christmas [and] they were [like] ten dollars [and] [we] expected [them] [to] work nice [for] [the] _little_ kids [and] they didn't work worth anything 
B|69| M: [what] [is] [it] ? 
A|70| A: [so] i'll tell [them] _that and_ they won't or [just] [you] [know] [just] answer _one_ [of] [the] questions [the] [wrong] way because [you] can [do] [that] [you] [know] 
B|71| M: [i] 
A|72| A: [but] [i] got [to] [do] more more fun things . 
B|73| M: [oh] . [well] ... [i guess] [you] [can't] [really] argue [that .] 
A|74| A: [so] [that's] [it] [that's] okay my [that] phone [is] ringing [to] an empty desk [and] she's _on_ vacation 
B|75| M: no [i'm] [the] [only] [one] [that] [is] sorry

A|78| A: uh-huh . huh . 
B|79| M: [i] spent as [little] as 5k _on [that_ and] [i'm] still [in] love . 
A|80| A: [it] [sure] does . [i] made mistake [one] year [and] planted some cantaloupe my goodness [what] [a] mistake [that] _was_ . 
B|81| M: [where] [do] [you] [go] [to] _school_ ? 
A|82| A: huh . 
B|83| M: wait ... [what] ? 
A|84| A: although he shouldn't [be] evaluated [on [that] .] 
B|85| M: yup . [uh] [i think] [so] 
A|86| A: than [we] [think] . [sure] . [sure] . 
B|87| M: that'snot [i have] problems 
A|88| A: uh-huh . yeah . [sure] 
B|89| M: [i [know] [i] was] joking .

B|91| M: [well] [it's a] [good] [thing] [i'm] here [i'm] [just] gonna [be] alone [for] [a] while 
A|92| A: [i] [well] yeah . [so] [i] am [and] [the] [the] best brand [of] chicken [to] buy [is the] [uh] pilgrim pride because they don't use [all] these hormones [to] remote [uh] unnatural growth [in] their products . 
B|93| M:
