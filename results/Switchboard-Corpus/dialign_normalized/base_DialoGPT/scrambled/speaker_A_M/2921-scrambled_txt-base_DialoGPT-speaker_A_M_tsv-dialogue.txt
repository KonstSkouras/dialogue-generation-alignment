B|21| M: _i'm_ [the] _one_ who [goes] alone . 
A|22| A: there's _, uh _,_ we've_ actually _got_ [a] kind [of a] _nice_ set _up ._ _we've_ _got_ [a] couple [of] plants _here_ [that] actually take _, uh ,_ recycled paper [and] shred _it_ [and] spray _it_ _with_ chemical treatment [so] [that] _it's_ [not] [a] fire hazard [and] make _it_ into insulation 
B|23| M: [well ,] you've _certainly_ [got] _me_ _there_ .

B|25| M: what's [the] matter ? 
A|26| A: _yeah_ . 
B|27| M: [i] hate _to_ _say_ _it ,_ 
A|28| A: [uh ,] _a lot_ [of] _people_ really doesn't _think_ [that] much _about_ [it ,] _because_ [it] hasn't happened [to] [them ,] which [it] hasn't [to] [me] either _, _you know_ ?_

B|33| M: [you know ?] 
A|34| A: kind [of] scary when [you] _think_ _about_ _that ._ 
B|35| M:  
A|36| A: [and] _, uh _,_ uh , i_ can't understand _why_ anyone _would_ abandon _this_ [dog] , though . 
B|37| M: _um_ ... _i think_ _we_ _can get_ [them] _out of_ _here ._ 
A|38| A: [but] _, uh _,_ you_ [certainly] _should_ [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and] _, uh ,_ _or_ evaluate [a] _person_ by _that ._ 
B|39| M: [yes ,] 
A|40| A: _right ._ 
B|41| M:  
A|42| A: _yeah ,_ _yeah [,_ and] there's _, uh ,_ there's _a lot_ [of] _people_ [here] _in_ baltimore [that] _, uh _,_ have_ [and] [we] _just_ had _, uh ,_ [a] real big cocaine bust [, and] [of] course _, _you know_ _,_ they're_ _, they're_ playing [it] _up_ real big [that] [it] _was_ , looked [like] [it] _was _a_ very_ , _very_ small ring [and] [they] _just_ happened _to get_ lucky [and] catch [the] _guy ._ 
B|43| M: [it's] ... [it's] ... 
A|44| A: uh-huh . 
B|45| M: _you , uh ,_ _don't_ [, _have] , uh_ ... 
A|46| A: _yeah_ . 
B|47| M: [it] _is_ . 
A|48| A: _uh , i_ used _to do_ [that] _a lot_ [and] then [i like] , [um] [, we] _have a_ new child [that] will [be a] year old [here] next week , [so] _i'll_ take _a lot_ [of] pictures [of] _her_ _, _you know_ [,_ and] spoil [them ,] 
B|49| M: [why] ? _what_ _is_ _the reason_ ? 
A|50| A: _okay ._ [and] [so] [we] _could_ [, we] _could_ talk _about_ [, uh ,] [that] path _, _you know_ ,_ _how_ important [you] [think] his benefits [are] . [and] [, and] [, and] [, uh ,] _how_ important [you] _think they are_ [and] _if_ _, what_ _would_ [you] [like] [to] see increased _in_ his benefits . 
B|51| M: [well [,] you know] 
A|52| A: _yeah _,_ right_ _that's_ [i think] _that's_ _the only_ _thing_ _that's_ going [to] change [it .] 
B|53| M: [yeah _,] my_ wife [, uh ,] likes [that .] 
A|54| A: huh . 
B|55| M: uhh [, we've] [never] done [it] 
A|56| A: [well ,] _in the_ last _two_ _years_ _, i have_ [not] played _very_ much golf _because_ _i am_ involved _in_ boy scouts . 
B|57| M:  
A|58| A: [so] [what] kind _do [you_ , uh ,] [get] ? 
B|59| M: _i'm_ _pretty_ _sure_ _that's a_ joke . 
A|60| A: uh-huh . uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [that's] [what] _i'm_ saying _, the_ _prices_ [are] usually higher than [the] cost [of the] game . 
A|62| A: [well ,] [that's] [it .] last year _, i think_ [it] _was_ [, _you know] [,_ my] peonies were , were , budding _in_ january [, and] [, _you know] _,_ there was_ _no_ _way_ [that] _was_ going [to] make [it [,] and] [sure] enough [, _you know] [,_ we] had really mild weather until [i think] [it] _was_ may _or_ something 
B|63| M: [right .] 
A|64| A: [yes ,] [yeah [,] we] had summer lasting long [and] then [it ,] then [it ,] then [it] became winter [like] [, uh] today [it's] , today [it's] _sort of_ change [to] warmer [to] _sort of_ _more_ typical autumn day . 
B|65| M: i'ed [you] 
A|66| A: [but] yet [they] _want_ _spend_ [the] money [to] build [the] new jails [that] _, _i_ mean ,_ [they] really [are] over , crowded , 
B|67| M: [i [,] uh [, i] _have] , uh_ ... [i have] [two] kids ... 
A|68| A: [so] , [that's] [why] _i do_ [that .] 
B|69| M: _i was _in_ the middle of the_ bus [at the end _of] my_ shift [, there [was] a] problem [with] german 
A|70| A: hit [the] bags . 
B|71| M: _yeah _, i_ do_ . 
A|72| A: [right .] 
B|73| M: [do] [we] ? 
A|74| A: huh . 
B|75| M: _well _, i_ guess_ _i'm_ gonna _go_ find _some_ [more] garbage [to] _pick [up_ .] 
A|76| A: [yeah , _i] mean_ [it ,] [it] [was] really exciting , growing [up] when , when [the] cowboys were really big . _because_ [my] parents _would_ always [have] season tickets [, and] they'd [go] [to] all [the] games [, and] _you know [,_ the] hype were _just_ unbelievable . [it's] _just_ [, _you know] [,_ the] last , _oh_ [i guess] probably since _about_ eighty-four , _about_ eighty-five [was] when [they] started kind [of] going downhill really [, but] [, _you know] _,_ i'm_ _just_ used [to] always growing [up] [and] hearing cowboys , cowboys , cowboys [, and] [, _you know] ,_ super bowl [, and] all _this_ other stuff . [so] [, i] can't [, _you know] _,_ [i'm_ not] going [to] decide _i don't_ [like] [them] _just_ _because_ _they're_ having _a few_ bad _years _._ _i_ mean _,_ i think_ they'll pull [out [of] [it] [,] and] [, _you know] ,_ they'll , they'll wind [up] being _good_ again . they've [got] [some] , _lot_ [of] really _good_ young players [that] [are] going _to ,_ [that] [are] going _to [,_ uh _,] do_ _pretty good_ _, i think ._ [but] _, they're_ raising [prices] _on_ their tickets . [so] _they're_ banking _on_ doing _good_ next season _. [i_ think] tickets [are] , 
B|77| M: [because] [of the] _cats_ 
A|78| A: _oh_ , _oh_ [yeah [,] and] every _time_ [you] see [one] hit _on_ [the] side [of the] road [you] [say] [is] [that] [my] cat . 
B|79| M: [i mean ,] _if you_ _want [to_ ,] [sure] . 
A|80| A: _oh_ , [yeah ,] i'd _do [it_ ,] i'd use [it] [for] _both_ . [the] _nice_ _thing_ _about_ autocrossing [is] [you] [can] [, you] [can] [do] _both_ . 
B|81| M: [and] _he's_ [a very] [nice] [guy .] 
A|82| A: [and] [, uh ,] [it] seems [to] [me] [that] [if you] _could_ _just_ _have a_ simple majority _or_ something [you] _could_ [pretty] much _you know ,_ browbeat [the] jury , [a] majority , [in the] , [of the] , [a] majority [of the] jury , 
B|83| M: _this is_ weird . 
A|84| A: _you know ,_ [that's] , [that's] totally _out ._ 
B|85| M: [how] [would] _it work_ ? 
A|86| A: huh . 
B|87| M: [you] [don't] [know] [how] [it] works ? 
A|88| A: [and] _they're_ being put [in the middle of the] city 
B|89| M: [you [,] i , i] speak english , 
A|90| A: [it] [was] _good_ _talking_ [to] _you ._ 
B|91| M: [i'm not] [the only] [one] who thinks _this [,_ uh ,] [is] [it] [just] [me] [or] [is] [it] 
A|92| A: [well [, i] do] , [too] [, i do] , [too] [and] [that] [was] [one] _thing_ _about_ [the] year around school [that] originally [we] had _been_ _sort of_ negative _on_ [it .] [but] then [we] started thinking , especially [in] plano [, the] weather _is so_ hot [in] august , [that] [there] really isn't _a lot_ [the] children [can] [do] outside anyhow . 
B|93| M: [why] _do _they_ have_ _so many_ kids ? 
A|94| A: [yeah ,] [that's] _good_ _. [well_ ,] [one] [of my] favorites [if] _i don't_ [want to] [have] other _people_ bring stuff _, i just_ [want to] treat [them] [is] [to] make chicken [and] rice . 
B|95| M: [i'm] _sorry_ [, [i] don't] _know what_ _you're_ [talking] [about] . 
A|96| A: [yeah] . 
B|97| M: [well ,] what's _up ?_ 
A|98| A: [well ,] basically , [yeah] [i] had _to do_ , [that] [, uh [,] _the] same [,_ uh ,] [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year _. [i_ mean] [uh ,] [because] [i was _in] a_ , _in a_ position [of] management [i] had responsibilities over _people_ [that] [, uh , i] needed [to] make [my] schedule [, uh ,] [so] [that] [if] [i was] [not] [there] _i would have_ coverage by [some] other management personnel , 
B|99| M: [you _know] what_ ? [i'm not] gonna [say] anything . 
A|100| A: [so] his solution [was] [to] burn plastic . collect [it] [and] burn [it .] 
B|101| M: she's [a] nurse . 
A|102| A: _that is_ when [she] did _, i think ._ 
B|103| M: [well , [i] would have] [to get] [the] [right] [sort of] [person] [to [do] [it] .] 
A|104| A: [well ,] [that's a] great _idea_ , [that's a] great _idea ._ 
B|105| M: [you .] 
A|106| A: precious [and] rascal [are] brother [and] sister [and] [they] [don't] [look] [a] _thing_ [a] [like] . nothing . precious [is] [a] medium hair yellow cat , 
B|107| M: [what] [do you] [do] [for a] living ? 
A|108| A: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [you [,] what] [, [you] [,] do] . 
A|110| A: huh . 
B|111| M: [this] . 
A|112| A: _okay ._ [so] we're _in garland_ . 
B|113| M: [i think] [, uh ,] [i'll] try [to get] [out [of] the] house [and] [spend] [some] [time] [with] [her] . 
A|114| A: [yeah] . 
B|115| M: [you _know] what_ ? 
A|116| A: _oh_ , [well ,] [that's] great , [that's] great . 
B|117| M: _it's still_ [a lot] better than [the] [community] . 
A|118| A: [right] _, [right_ .] 
B|119| M: [well [,] they're] [not] wrong . 
A|120| A: [but] [, _you know] ,_ seems [like] there's [just] [so many] things [to do] down [here] [, [i] like the] sports [, i] play [a lot] [of] racquetball . 
B|121| M: [i] . 
A|122| A: [but] [not] all country _. [i_ don't] [like] [that] , when [they] start , 
B|123| M:  ... [i'm] [so] _sorry_ . 
A|124| A: there's [a lot] [of] folks , probably , [that] _are in_ prison [that] [, uh ,] [that] aren't really [a] danger [to] society , huh [, and] [, uh ,] 
B|125| M: [i don't] [know [,] i just] [think they are] [interesting .] 
A|126| A: _no_ . 
B|127| M: [they're] [both] [the same [,] right] ? 
A|128| A: [but] _, i think_ _that [the_ reason] [they are] full [is] [because] [they] [know] _that they_ [can get] _away_ [with] [it .] 
B|129| M: i've [never] _heard_ [that] [before] . [i'll] [have] [to] check [it] [out .] 
A|130| A: [right .] [just] [get] [you] _away from the_ everyday things [that] [are] going _on_ . [we] , when [the] children were smaller [we] used [to] [go] [to [,] uh ,] delaware along [the] ocean most every year . [and] [that] [was] fun [we] stayed mostly [in] state parks [and] [, [uh ,] we] really enjoyed [that .] 
B|131| M: [because] [people] [don't] [know] . 
A|132| A: [yeah] . 
B|133| M: [i think] [you] [should] [be] careful .

A|140| A: bon [yeah] . 
B|141| M: [she] [is so] tiny . 
A|142| A: [well ,] [yeah ,] [they] [don't] [like] [it] [in] [here] [because] there's nothing [to] eat
