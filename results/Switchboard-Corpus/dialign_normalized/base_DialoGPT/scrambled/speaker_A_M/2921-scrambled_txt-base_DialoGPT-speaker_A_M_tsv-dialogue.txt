B|21| M: _i'm_ [the] _one_ who [goes] alone . 
A|22| A: there's [uh] _we've_ actually _got_ [a] kind [of a] _nice_ set _up ._ _we've_ _got_ [a] couple [of] plants _here_ [that] actually take [uh] recycled paper [and] shred _it_ [and] spray _it_ _with_ chemical treatment [so] [that] _it's_ [not] [a] fire hazard [and] make _it_ into insulation 
B|23| M: [well] you've _certainly_ [got] _me_ _there_ . 
A|24| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ [well] neither [can] [i] [so] _i _i_ _i_ _i_ _i_ i_ did _my_ service _before_ [and] _i'll_ _do_ _my_ little _community_ service throughout [but] _never_ _never_ [for a] year again . 
B|25| M: what's [the] matter ? 
A|26| A: _yeah_ . 
B|27| M: [i] hate _to_ _say_ [it] 
A|28| A: [uh] _a lot_ [of] _people_ really doesn't _think_ [that] much _about_ [it] _because_ [it] hasn't happened [to] [them] which [it] hasn't [to] [me] either _you know ?_ 
B|29| M: _what_ _is_ [the] name [of the] coach ? 
A|30| A: _yes_ . _yes_ _yes_ _. i just_ [i love] [that] all those [that] _two_ hours

A|32| A: uh-huh . 
B|33| M: [you know ?] 
A|34| A: kind [of] scary when [you] _think_ _about_ _that ._ 
B|35| M:  
A|36| A: [and uh] _uh i_ can't understand _why_ anyone _would_ abandon _this_ [dog] though . 
B|37| M: _um_ ... _i think_ _we_ _can get_ [them] _out of_ _here ._ 
A|38| A: [but] [uh] [you] [certainly] _should_ [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and uh] _or_ evaluate [a] _person_ by _that ._ 
B|39| M: [yes] 
A|40| A: _right ._ 
B|41| M:  
A|42| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ [and] there's [uh] there's _a lot_ [of] _people_ [here] _in_ baltimore [that] [uh] _have_ [and] [we] _just_ had [uh] [a] real big cocaine bust [and] [of] course [you know] _they're_ _they're_ playing [it] _up_ real big [that] [it] _was_ looked [like] [it] _was _a_ very_ _very_ small ring [and] [they] _just_ happened _to get_ lucky [and] catch [the] _guy ._ 
B|43| M: [it's] ... [it's] ... 
A|44| A: uh-huh . 
B|45| M: _you uh_ _don't_ _have uh_ ... 
A|46| A: _yeah_ . 
B|47| M: [it] _is_ . 
A|48| A: _uh i_ used _to do_ [that] _a lot_ [and] then [i like] [um] [we] _have a_ new child [that] will [be a] year old [here] next week [so] _i'll_ take _a lot_ [of] pictures [of] _her_ [you know] [and] spoil [them] 
B|49| M: [why] ? _what_ _is_ _the reason_ ? 
A|50| A: _okay ._ [and] [so] [we] _could_ [we] _could_ talk _about_ [uh] [that] path [you _know] how_ important [you] [think] his benefits [are] . [and] [and] [and uh] _how_ important [you] _think they are_ [and] _if_ [what] _would_ [you] [like] [to] see increased _in_ his benefits . 
B|51| M: _well [you_ know] 
A|52| A: _yeah_ _right_ _that's_ [i think] _that's_ _the only_ _thing_ _that's_ going [to] change [it .] 
B|53| M: [yeah] [my] wife [uh] likes [that .] 
A|54| A: huh . 
B|55| M: uhh [we've] [never] done [it] 
A|56| A: [well] _in the_ last _two_ _years_ _i have_ [not] played _very_ much golf _because_ _i am_ involved _in_ boy scouts . 
B|57| M:  
A|58| A: [so] [what] kind _do [you_ uh] [get] ? 
B|59| M: _i'm_ _pretty_ _sure_ _that's a_ joke . 
A|60| A: uh-huh . uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [that's] [what] _i'm_ saying [the] _prices_ [are] usually higher than [the] cost [of the] game . 
A|62| A: [well] [that's] [it .] last year [i think] [it] _was_ [you know] [my] peonies were were budding _in_ january [and] [you know] _there was_ _no_ _way_ [that] _was_ going [to] make [it] [and] [sure] enough [you know] [we] had really mild weather until [i think] [it] _was_ may _or_ something 
B|63| M: [right .] 
A|64| A: [yes] [yeah] [we] had summer lasting long [and] then [it] then [it] then [it] became winter [like] [uh] today [it's] today [it's] _sort of_ change [to] warmer [to] _sort of_ _more_ typical autumn day . 
B|65| M: i'ed [you] 
A|66| A: [but] yet [they] _want_ _spend_ [the] money [to] build [the] new jails [that] _i mean_ [they] really [are] over crowded 
B|67| M: [i] [uh [i] _have] uh_ ... [i have] [two] kids ... 
A|68| A: [so] [that's] [why] _i do_ [that .] 
B|69| M: _i was _in_ the middle of the_ bus [at the end _of] my_ shift [there [was] a] problem [with] german 
A|70| A: hit [the] bags . 
B|71| M: _yeah [i_ do] . 
A|72| A: [right .] 
B|73| M: [do] [we] ? 
A|74| A: huh . 
B|75| M: _well _i_ guess_ _i'm_ gonna _go_ find _some_ [more] garbage [to] _pick [up_ .] 
A|76| A: [yeah _i] mean_ [it] [it] [was] really exciting growing [up] when when [the] cowboys were really big . _because_ [my] parents _would_ always [have] season tickets [and] they'd [go] [to] all [the] games [and] [you know] [the] hype were _just_ unbelievable . [it's] _just_ [you know] [the] last _oh_ [i guess] probably since _about_ eighty-four _about_ eighty-five [was] when [they] started kind [of] going downhill really [but] [you know] [i'm] _just_ used [to] always growing [up] [and] hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys [and] [you know] super bowl [and] all _this_ other stuff . [so] [i] can't [you know] [i'm not] going [to] decide _i don't_ [like] [them] _just_ _because_ _they're_ having _a few_ bad _years _._ _i_ mean_ [i think] they'll pull [out [of] it] [and] [you know] they'll they'll wind [up] being _good_ again . they've [got] [some] _lot_ [of] really _good_ young players [that] [are] going [to] [that] [are] going [to] [uh] [do] _pretty good_ _i think ._ [but] _they're_ raising [prices] _on_ their tickets . [so] _they're_ banking _on_ doing _good_ next season _. [i_ think] tickets [are] 
B|77| M: [because] [of the] _cats_ 
A|78| A: _oh_ _oh_ [yeah] [and] every _time_ [you] see [one] hit _on_ [the] side [of the] road [you] [say] [is] [that] [my] cat . 
B|79| M: [i mean] _if you_ _want to_ [sure] . 
A|80| A: _oh_ [yeah] i'd _do it_ i'd use [it] [for] _both_ . [the] _nice_ _thing_ _about_ autocrossing [is] [you] [can] [you] [can] [do] _both_ . 
B|81| M: [and] _he's_ [a very] [nice] [guy .] 
A|82| A: [and uh] [it] seems [to] [me] [that] [if you] _could_ _just_ _have a_ simple majority _or_ something [you] _could_ [pretty] much [you know] browbeat [the] jury [a] majority [in the] [of the] [a] majority [of the] jury 
B|83| M: _this is_ weird . 
A|84| A: [you know] [that's] [that's] totally _out ._ 
B|85| M: [how] [would] _it work_ ? 
A|86| A: huh . 
B|87| M: [you] [don't] [know how] [it] works ? 
A|88| A: [and] _they're_ being put [in the middle of the] city 
B|89| M: [you] [i i] speak english 
A|90| A: [it] [was] _good_ _talking_ [to] _you ._ 
B|91| M: [i'm not] [the only] [one] who thinks [this] [uh] [is] [it] [just] [me] [or] [is] [it] 
A|92| A: [well [i] do] [too] [i do] [too] [and] [that] [was] [one] _thing_ _about_ [the] year around school [that] originally [we] had _been_ _sort of_ negative _on_ [it .] [but] then [we] started thinking especially [in] plano [the] weather _is so_ hot [in] august [that] [there] really isn't _a lot_ [the] children [can] [do] outside anyhow . 
B|93| M: [why] _do _they_ have_ _so many_ kids ? 
A|94| A: [yeah] [that's] _good_ _. well_ [one] [of my] favorites [if] _i don't_ [want to] [have] other _people_ bring stuff _i just_ [want to] treat [them] [is] [to] make chicken [and] rice . 
B|95| M: [i'm] _sorry_ [i don't] _know what_ _you're_ [talking] [about] . 
A|96| A: [yeah] . 
B|97| M: [well] what's _up ?_ 
A|98| A: [well] basically [yeah i] had _to do_ [that] [uh] _the same_ [uh] [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year _. [i_ mean] [uh] [because] [i was _in] a_ _in a_ position [of] management [i] had responsibilities over _people_ [that] [uh i] needed [to] make [my] schedule [uh] [so] [that] [if] [i was] [not] [there] _i would have_ coverage by [some] other management personnel 
B|99| M: [you _know] what_ ? [i'm not] gonna [say] anything . 
A|100| A: [so] his solution [was] [to] burn plastic . collect [it] [and] burn [it .] 
B|101| M: she's [a] nurse . 
A|102| A: _that is_ when [she] did _i think ._ 
B|103| M: [well [i] would have] [to get] [the] [right] [sort of] [person] [to [do] [it] .] 
A|104| A: [well] [that's a] great _idea_ [that's a] great _idea ._ 
B|105| M: [you .] 
A|106| A: precious [and] rascal [are] brother [and] sister [and] [they] [don't] [look] [a] _thing_ [a] [like] . nothing . precious [is] [a] medium hair yellow cat 
B|107| M: [what] [do you] [do] [for a] living ? 
A|108| A: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [you] [what] [you] [do] . 
A|110| A: huh . 
B|111| M: [this] . 
A|112| A: _okay ._ [so] we're _in garland_ . 
B|113| M: [i think] [uh] [i'll] try [to get] [out [of] the] house [and] [spend] [some] [time] [with] [her] . 
A|114| A: [yeah] . 
B|115| M: [you _know] what_ ? 
A|116| A: _oh_ [well] [that's] great [that's] great . 
B|117| M: _it's still_ [a lot] better than [the] [community] . 
A|118| A: [right] [right .] 
B|119| M: [well] [they're] [not] wrong . 
A|120| A: [but] [you know] seems [like] there's [just] [so many] things [to do] down [here] [i like the] sports [i] play [a lot] [of] racquetball . 
B|121| M: [i] . 
A|122| A: [but] [not] all country _. [i_ don't] [like] [that] when [they] start 
B|123| M:  ... [i'm] [so] _sorry_ . 
A|124| A: there's [a lot] [of] folks probably [that] _are in_ prison [that] [uh] [that] aren't really [a] danger [to] society huh [and uh] 
B|125| M: [i don't] [know] [i just] [think they are] [interesting .] 
A|126| A: _no_ . 
B|127| M: [they're] [both] [the same] [right] ? 
A|128| A: [but] [i think] _that [the_ reason] [they are] full [is] [because] [they] [know] _that they_ [can get] _away_ [with] [it .] 
B|129| M: i've [never] _heard_ [that] [before] . [i'll] [have] [to] check [it] [out .] 
A|130| A: [right .] [just] [get] [you] _away from the_ everyday things [that] [are] going _on_ . [we] when [the] children were smaller [we] used [to] [go] [to] [uh] delaware along [the] ocean most every year . [and] [that] [was] fun [we] stayed mostly [in] state parks [and uh we] really enjoyed [that .] 
B|131| M: [because] [people] [don't] [know] . 
A|132| A: [yeah] . 
B|133| M: [i think] [you] [should] [be] careful .
