B|77| M: i'll [be] [her] friend . 
A|78| A: [yeah ,] [we] [, uh ,] she's [, uh ,] into aerobics [, and] [, uh [,] _and] we_ did aerobics together [for] [about] [a] month [and a] half

[and] , [of] course , [there are] [people] [in the] big cities who would [do] _, like_ nothing better than [to] take advantage [of them .] 
B|85| M: _that's just_ [, [like] ,] [your] opinion , [man .] 
A|86| A: [right] .

A|92| A: [yeah ,] now , dallas [is] [a] [i'm] being very sarcastic [, it's just] [a] great [, uh ,] [on] [some] days [, uh [,] it's] [, uh , i don't know] [the] good ole boy network [here] [is] [, uh ,] very strange [, like] [i] said [they] believe [that ,] if [they] kill somebody , [you know ,] tit [for] tat [and] , deed [for] deed [that ,] [that] does something [, uh ,] 
B|93| M:  ...

B|107| M: [and we] [have] [the] [two] most important [gun] rights [in the] world . 
A|108| A: [i [,] i don't] either . [it's a] [really] delicate [, uh ,] moral , issue . [because] , if [you have] , well [, [i] guess] [the] [one] thing [i] [do] [see] [that] [is] , [is] [that] needs [to be] [a] solution [is] , [that] if [you] [do] let [people] into [the] country [, i] [do] feel [you have a] certain obligation [to] , [to] get [them] [on] their feet . 
B|109| M: [i] 
A|110| A: [i've heard] [all] these stories [about] [, i] travel extensively [and] spend [, uh ,] maybe half [a] year [in] europe every year , 
B|111| M: [i] [thought] [it [was] just] [the] federal [government] [that] allowed guns [to be] purchased [and] sold [in the] [state] [of] florida . 
A|112| A: [uh ,] especially , [you know ,] [in [the] case] [of] murder
