[it's] [really] um this has opened my eyes [to] thinking [you know] at [one] time [i] [just] sat [here] [and] _thought_ well how can anybody believe [that] [because] i'd [really] [never] met [people] [that] did [and] now [i] talk [to] [people] [that] [do] . so [that's] [it's] [really] interesting . 
B|71| M: [i'm] [in the] valley [it's] 
A|72| A: [yeah] why _i don't know i_ [i think they're] kind [of] nice [to] [have] [they're] kind [of] [you know] [just] relaxing [to] [i don't know] [to] pet [and] [to] [i don't know] when [they] [like] sit up [on] [your] lap [and] stuff [like] [that] [just] kind [of] enjoyable [to] [you know] [have] [like] [i don't know] something giving [you] [some] affection [as] well .

[i know] george bush threw out [the] first pitch hitter bounced off [the] ground [and] [that] um [yeah] [i] [heard] [a] joke [on the] radio yesterday [that] [in] regard [that] _he didn't_ design [the] patriot missile system [and] [uh] [the] radio's kind [of] cruel [i] [mean] [think] [the] _he_ this chain [that] must [have] been [on] president bush [to] bounce [the] first pitch off [the] ground [i] [mean] how humiliating _for a_ _man_ [to do] [that] any _man ._ [i don't] care if [you're] president . 
B|77| M: i'll [be] [her] friend . 
A|78| A: [yeah] [we] [uh] she's [uh] into aerobics [and] [uh] _and we_ did aerobics together [for] [about] [a] month [and a] half

A|80| A: uh-huh . 
B|81| M:  
A|82| A: uh-huh . 
B|83| M: [i know] [it's just] ... [i don't know [i] don't] [really] [know] . 
A|84| A: [and] [uh] so [they] _come_ [here] [and] [they] [don't know] [what] [the] heck [they're] doing . [and] [they're] finding themselves adrift [in the] big cities . [and] [of] course [there are] [people] [in the] big cities who would [do] [like] nothing better than [to] take advantage [of them .] 
B|85| M: _that's just_ [like] [your] opinion [man .] 
A|86| A: [right] . 
B|87| M: [yes] 
A|88| A: [uh]

A|90| A: okay . 
B|91| M: [you [know] i] voted [for [a] lot [of] the] local candidates . 
A|92| A: [yeah] now dallas [is] [a] [i'm] being very sarcastic [it's just] [a] great [uh] [on] [some] days [uh] [it's] [uh i don't know] [the] good ole boy network [here] [is] [uh] very strange [like] [i] said [they] believe [that] if [they] kill somebody [you know] tit [for] tat [and] deed [for] deed [that] [that] does something [uh] 
B|93| M:  ... 
A|94| A: [i think] that'd [be] an interesting experience . [but] [uh i] haven't done [that]

B|107| M: [and we] [have] [the] [two] most important [gun] rights [in the] world . 
A|108| A: [i] [i don't] either . [it's a] [really] delicate [uh] moral issue . [because] if [you have] well [i guess] [the] [one] thing [i] [do] [see] [that] [is] [is] [that] needs [to be] [a] solution [is] [that] if [you] [do] let [people] into [the] country [i] [do] feel [you have a] certain obligation [to] [to] get [them] [on] their feet . 
B|109| M: [i] 
A|110| A: [i've heard] [all] these stories [about] [i] travel extensively [and] spend [uh] maybe half [a] year [in] europe every year 
B|111| M: [i] [thought] [it [was] just] [the] federal [government] [that] allowed guns [to be] purchased [and] sold [in the] [state] [of] florida . 
A|112| A: [uh] especially [you know] [in [the] case] [of] murder
