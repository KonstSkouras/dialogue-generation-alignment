B|57| M:  
A|58| A: _oh_ [i'm] [sure] [yeah] _there_ _i mean_ [you] can go [down] [a] street [and] _here_ _he_ told [you] [this] every other [house] [you know] _if_ _it's_ _been_ foreclosed on or [you know] even [big] executives 
B|59| M: [it's] [a] _long_ story . 
A|60| A: [uh] 
B|61| M: uhh [what] did [he] expect ? 
A|62| A: [what] _i've been_ doing when _i get_ invited someplace [and] bring something [i] make [uh] food kabobs . [you] [take] little toothpicks [and] cut [up] [uh] pineapple [and] strawberry [and] even banana _if_ [you] can [do] [it] [just] before [you] leave . 
B|63| M: [i mean] _you're_ [i'm] [going to] [i've been] [i] [know] . 
A|64| A: [yeah] _oh_ [but] boy [you] try _get_ into [that] you'd [really] open [a] can [of] worms . 
B|65| M: _there's_ [one] [of] those [that] [was] working [for] [the] american cancer society [and then] [the] same [one] [who] worked [for] [the] british cancer society . 
A|66| A: uh-huh . 
B|67| M: yea [i] am [and] [i'm] [just] [here] [for] [the] fun . 
A|68| A: [you're] [just] as blessed _probably_ more because _if_ [you] follow [this] [there's] [a] _good_ book called [what] [the] bible has [to] say _about_ child training by richard fugate 
B|69| M: [what] happened _to you_ ? 
A|70| A: uh-huh . 
B|71| M: [how] [do] _you know this_ ? 
A|72| A: yes . yes [and] sometimes now we're getting [that] [uh] [the] other football where [they] play [it] inside [and] [you know [this] is] [a] [you know [this] is] too [much] saturdays [and] sunday [this is] fine [but] [do] we [have to] carry [this] on into [the] summer [and] [the] spring [you know] all [of] [that] 
B|73| M: [i'm] [a] student [and i've got] [a] car . 
A|74| A: [yeah] [i] _think_ [that] _that's_ _um_ [i] can remember [in] pittsburgh when [this] has [to] [do] with homes [uh] indirectly [but i] can remember when upper saint clair [was] out _in the_ [you know] [the] rural end [of] washington 
B|75| M: _i have_ [no] _idea_ [why] [i] am [so] [good] [at] [this] . 
A|76| A: [but i] _think_ [it] also cost _um_ quite [a] bit as far as because after [they're] done with [the] war [a lot of] things _were_ [no] longer put [to] use [. [i] mean] [it] [was] kind [of] [like] okay we'll [do] [this] during [this] point [and] _time_ [but] after [that] _that's_ [you know] [uh] [they] didn't want [to] [do] [it] anymore . 
B|77| M: [well] [if] [they're] [not] [going [to] be] [there] [for] [a] while [they're] [probably] [not] [going] [home .] 
A|78| A: [and] _um_ [i] believe [that] [the] [idea] [of] burning [the] flag [is] [is in] 
B|79| M: [the] last [time] [they] [were] [here] [they] werent . 
A|80| A: _that's_ right . [if] [i have] [a] problem discipline [you know i] _think_ now boy [i] [really] need _to get_ out [you know] [and] apply something [you know] [and] [i] screw around [and] [don't] [do] [it] or wait too [long] or something . 
B|81| M: [you] [have [to] get] [the] trade [in] . 
A|82| A: bang *one utt ?? bang . 
B|83| M: [well] mine [is] still [there] . 
A|84| A: uh-huh . [i've] never done potato . we [used to] [do] [it] [at] [home] when [i] [was] [a] kid had [a] huge garden . 
B|85| M:  . 
A|86| A: [of] course . 
B|87| M:  ... _i don't_ [know] ... 
A|88| A: [probably] [the] biggest items [that] [uh] [that] [you] [get] [in] our neighborhood or would [be] [the] high classed automobiles [the] [you know] mercedes volvos things [that] [they] can [get] [you know] [big] dollars [for] [and] [the] jewelry [are the] major targets 
B|89| M: [you know what] ? 
A|90| A: _oh_ [it's] tough [it really] [is] . 
B|91| M: [i'm] sorry ? 
A|92| A: saint claude [is] [that] sound familiar ?

[i] mean] [i don't] [like] credit cards [i] wish [that] [they] would come [up] with some other way [to [you] know] [the only] way [you] could use [them] [is] [if] [you] [were] [like] on vacation . [they] would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] year . [you know [i] mean] [of] course [i] guess some people go out [and] spend their whole entire limit on [it] [like] [that] [at] [that] [time] [but] [um] [i have] seen [so] many people [and] [i have] [a] friend right now [she] [just] [got] off [of] thirteen . [she] [got] [uh] [i] [can't] remember [what] [she] called [it] [it's] some kind [of] maybe [it's] [sure] or something [like] [that] [it's] something [it's] some weird name [of] [a] credit card
