B|67| M: yea [, i] am [, and] [i'm] [just] [here] [for] [the] fun . 
A|68| A: [you're] [just] as blessed , _probably_ more , because _if_ [you] follow [this] , [there's] [a] _good_ book called [what] [the] bible has [to] say _about_ child training , by richard fugate 
B|69| M: [what] happened [to] [you] ? 
A|70| A: uh-huh . 
B|71| M: [how] [do] [you know] [this] ? 
A|72| A: yes . yes [, and] sometimes now we're getting [that] , [uh ,] [the] other football where [they] play [it] inside [, and] [you know ,] [this is] [a] [, you know ,] [this is] too [much] saturdays [and] sunday , [this is] fine [, but] [do] we [have to] carry [this] on into [the] summer [and] [the] spring [you know ,] all [of] [that] , 
B|73| M: [i'm] [a] student [and i've got] [a] car . 
A|74| A: [yeah [,] i] _think_ [that] _that's_ , _um [,_ i] can remember [in] pittsburgh when , [this] has [to] [do] with homes , [uh ,] indirectly [but i] can remember when upper saint clair [was] out _in the_ [, you know ,] [the] rural end [of] washington , 
B|75| M: _i have_ [no] _idea_ [why] [i] am [so] [good] [at] [this] . 
A|76| A: [but i] _think_ [it] also cost , _um ,_ quite [a] bit as far as because after [they're] done with [the] war [, [a] lot of] things _were_ [no] longer put [to] use [. [i] mean] [it] [was] kind [of] [like] , okay , we'll [do] [this] during [this] point [and] _time_ [but] after [that] _that's_ [, you know ,] [uh] [they] didn't want [to] [do] [it] anymore . 
B|77| M: [well] [if] [they're] [not] [going [to] be] [there] [for] [a] while [, they're] [probably] [not] [going] [home .]

B|79| M: [the] last [time] [they] [were] [here] [they] werent . 
A|80| A: _that's_ right . [if] [i have] [a] problem discipline [, you know , i] _think_ , now , boy [, i] [really] need _to get_ out [, you know [,] and] apply something [, you know [,] and] [i] screw around [and] [don't] [do] [it] or wait too [long] or something . 
B|81| M: [you] [have [to] get] [the] trade [in] . 
A|82| A: bang , *one utt ?? bang . 
B|83| M: [well ,] mine [is] still [there] . 
A|84| A: uh-huh . [i've] never done potato . we [used to] [do] [it] [at] [home] when [i] [was] [a] kid , had [a] huge garden . 
B|85| M:  . 
A|86| A: [of] course .

[they] would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] year . [you know , [i] mean] , [of] course [, i] guess some people go out [and] spend their whole entire limit on [it] [like] [that] [at] [that] [time] [but] , [um [,] [i] have] seen [so] many people [and] [i have] [a] friend right now [she] [just] [got] off [of] thirteen . [she] [got] , [uh [,] i] [can't] remember [what] [she] called [it ,] [it's] some kind [of] , maybe [it's] [sure] or something [like] [that] , [it's] something , [it's] some weird name [of] [a] credit card ,
