A|70| A: uh-huh . uh-huh .

B|79| M: uhh [i don't] [know] [what] [you're] talking _about_ . 
A|80| A: more more [i] [can] understand [that] [that's] probably _what i_ [would] [uh] 
B|81| M:  ... 
A|82| A: yeah probably [i was] allergic [to] dogs when [i was] [a] kid [in] [fact] 
B|83| M: [i'm] [just] [not] [really] interested [in] _any_ [of] [that] . 
A|84| A: _oh ._ 
B|85| M: [you know] what's [small] ? 
A|86| A: yeah . 
B|87| M: [that's] [what i] [said] . 
A|88| A: [yes] [and] [that's] [that's] [one] [thing] [i] [do] [have] . 
B|89| M:  
A|90| A: [but] boy three hundred dollars [a] week doesn't go [very] far on child care . 
B|91| M: [i'm] 
A|92| A: [and] [i] did [it] um for [one] reason [i] wanted [i was] working on [a] masters degree [so] [i] wanted [to] stay close [to] where [i was] working on [a] masters degree [but] also [because] [i] [just] thought [that] [it] [would be] interesting [to] [live] some place else [so] totally different than my _own_ up bringing 
B|93| M: _i think_ [it's] bad [because] [it's] [not] even bad . 
A|94| A: yeah . 
B|95| M: [yes] [it] [is] . 
A|96| A: [is] she [the] oldest [one] ? 
B|97| M:  ... 
A|98| A: [okay] [have a] good night . all [right] bye-bye . 
B|99| M: [i] . 
A|100| A: [and] [uh] now tonight [i] [just] finished up with [that] [a] woman called jackie did [you] watch did [you] watch [it] ? 
B|101| M: [i don't] _think_ [it's] [the] same [i've] been [in] [it] since [i was] [six] . 
A|102| A: [right] . 
B|103| M: [can] [you] borrow [money] [to] buy [your] [own] house ? 
A|104| A: [oh] [i've] never heard [of] polk [but] 
B|105| M: june 
A|106| A: bye-bye . 
B|107| M: [i'm] [not] [sure .] 
A|108| A: [you] [want to] yeah . they'll let [you] work decrease [your] number [of] hours by [any] percentage [just] [just] [about] [so] if [you] [want to] [get] [your] masters [and] then [i think] [of] course [you] [get] [like] [a] with [your] extra degrees [you] [get] [a] pay raise due [so] [that] [will] probably help out . 
B|109| M: [oh [.] uh] ... [i] guess [that] makes sense .
