A|88| A: [it] takes [a] , [yeah ,] [it] does take some space . 
B|89| M: [yes] [, [i] think that's] _what_ [i] [said] . 
A|90| A: [i] _mean_ [i don't] [like] guns [in] general [but] when [i think] about [, uh ,] this topic [like] capital punishment [i] [look] at somebody [, i] _mean_ [, i] [just] remember when [i] was [in] college [in a] dorm [and [i] think] [if] he'd [been] around _one_ [of] my _family_ members probably would [have] killed him [but] [in] florida , [in the] state [of] washington when [they] had [the] ted bundy case 
B|91| M: [i'm not] gonna lie .

B|99| M: [oh .] [o] [. [i] _think] [they_ have] . 
A|100| A: [that's] some , [yeah ,] because [a lot] [of] people seem [to] stagnate once [they] [get] into position [, they] [, they're] very comfortable [, they] lose [the] ability [to] learn [, and] [they] [in a] sense become unteachable . [they] [think they] [know] [all] there [is] [to] [know] [in the] area , [set] path [, and] [you] [know ,] come [in] [and] put my time [in] [from] nine [to] five [, and] when [that's] over with , [that's] , [that's] [it] , without [even] giving [a] second thought [to] , advancing their education [or] getting extracurricular , um , education [, and] [, and [i] think that's] an excellent opportunity _for_ us [to] expand ourselves also . 
B|101| M: [i] 
A|102| A: uh-huh . [right] . 
B|103| M: [but] ... [it's] [not] [a] soup . 
A|104| A: uh-huh . [the] taxes [that] people [don't think] about [that] , [yeah ,] [the] , [the] , [the] income tax [is] [a lot more] visible portion [of the] taxes [you] pay [, i] guess . 
B|105| M: [i'm] ... [not sure] [if] [i] should laugh [or] cry . 
A|106| A: [and] [, uh ,] 
B|107| M: [it's] always [nice] [to [see] a] [family] [that's] straight [and] straight 
B|108| M: [oh .] [so] [you] [mean] [you're] [not [the] one] who's paying [for] [it ?]
