B|23| M: _did_ [you [go] [to] the] great barrier reef ? 
A|24| A: _yeah_ [it] _and_ [it] _if you_ _um_ _well_ _first_ [of] _all_ [i] take _about_ [a] quarter _and_ [a] half [of] milk _and_ [i] put [it] [in] [a] two quart saucepan _and_ [you] put [it] on [a] _really_ low heat .

B|43| M: [but] he doesn't bite anyone . 
A|44| A: [and] _we_ ended up _with_ them right . [and] [so] _we_ [were] walking up

A|46| A: okay . 
B|47| M: [this] [is] [the] _only_ _time in_ history [that] [we] [have] [had] news [that] happened . 
A|48| A: _oh_ [i'm] [so] [sorry .] [but] that's [good] [that] _you're_ going [to get] another _one ._ 
B|49| M: what's wrong [with] classical music ? 
A|50| A: _and they_ can actually use as much recycled paper as [the] community can [get] [to] them . because [they] [are] actually buying [it] [and] shipping [it] [in] [from] outside . 
B|51| M: _i agree_ . i'd rather [be] poor than _have a_ high cost [of] living . 
A|52| A: _oh_ _really_ . 
B|53| M: american ? 
A|54| A: okay _well_ _there's_ _uh_ [it's] kind [of] an interesting topic [and] _one_ [that] [i think] [is] quite fascinating because _uh_ couple [of] years ago [i] guess _uh_ [not] very [not] very long ago seemed [like] [the] whole world [not] [just] [the] united states [but] [the] whole world _was_ kind [of] [in] [a] standstill [where] everyone _was_ basically [in] _uh_ _you know_ [a] very comfortable position [so] [to] say even though [the] [the] cold war _was_ _was_ [in] full swing . _you know_ [you] [had] [the] [the] russians against [the] americans [the] communists against [the] free world [and] [in] [the] last couple [of] years things [have] changed dramatically [not] [only] on [the] political front [but] also on [the] economic front [where] _uh_ couple [of] years ago [we] [had] _uh_ america _was_ _one_ [of the] leading powers [and] _one_ [of the] strongest nations [in] [the] world as far as economics [were] concerned [and] [now] [we're] having [a] very tough [time in] [a] recessionary period . [we're] also [have a] very humongous trade deficit [and] _uh_ [and] that's kind [of] frightening . also _you know_ [a] couple [of] years ago ten fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going [into] [a] career could expect [to] [have] [that] career basically throughout their whole life [and] thirty years ago [that] _was_ [that] _was_ basically [it] whereas [now] [we're] expected [to] [have a] career change every _you know_ every couple [of] years [and] possibly four [to] five career changes throughout our lifetime [and] [so] [i think] _uh_ _you know_ things _there's_ [been] an awful _lot of_ social change lately [and and] _uh_ . 
B|55| M: [i'm] [sorry] [to] hear [that .] 
A|56| A: [and] [i'm] hoping especially [with] _those_ [big] tall sides on there [it] [that] maybe [i] won't [have] _oh_ _i'll_ [have] less _of a_ bug [problem] at least [they] [they'll] [have a] _hard_ [time] crawling up [the] thing . 
B|57| M: spanish [is] [a] dialect [of] english [not] [a] language . 
A|58| A: okay . _well_ 
B|59| M: _she_ _does_ . 
A|60| A: [she] _has_ twelve children . 
B|61| M: [i don't] [really] [have] any [of those] . 
A|62| A: _yeah_ [i] guess [so] that's true . _yeah_ . 
B|63| M: [i'm] [in] utah _and [it's_ not] . 
A|64| A: [i mean] [it's] worked successfully [in] europe . 
B|65| M: [i] 
A|66| A: _they're_ _able to_ move [in] while _they're_ still independent [and] still social 
B|67| M: [yeah] [and] [there's] ... 
A|68| A: wow . [all] [that] [for] getting tennis balls shot at [you] at [a] hundred miles an hour . 
B|69| M: [are] [you] [in] [this] picture ? 
A|70| A: wow . 
B|71| M: _how_ _do [you_ know] [about that] ? 
A|72| A: [it] feels after they've [been] [here] ten minutes [they] [have] already explored [the] entire house [they] [know] everything . 
B|73| M: [oh] [um] [yeah] er ... 
A|74| A: uh-huh . 
B|75| M: _your_ mother [has] cats ? 
A|76| A: okay . 
B|77| M: uhh [uh] [uh huh]

B|79| M: uhh . uhuh [. uh] 
A|80| A: [oh] 
B|81| M: [yeah] [we] [have [a] lot of] fun [in] music _too_

B|83| M: [they] [were] [the] _most_ popular [and they] [were] [the first] [to] [be] popular 
A|84| A: [yeah] [i] find [it] surprising . because [a lot of] times [it] [here] [you know] _i'll_ talk [to] some [people] [here] [and] _i'll_ mention someone's some talk host [and] _i'll_ expect them [to] [have] an opinion on _why_ [i don't] [like] him [and] [don't] listen [they] [don't] even [know] [you know] [what] [the] guys name [is] [uh] . bruce williams [who] [does] financial [work] [all] over [the] united states . [most] [people] haven't heard [of] bruce williams . [you] probably haven't either unless _you're_ [a] radio buff . 
B|85| M: _do you_ [mean] carpool ? 
A|86| A: [huh] . _well_ that's _well_ [that] sounds interesting . matter [of] fact [uh] [i] guess [you] [do] [uh] [you] [get] [a lot of] graphics [in] there [i] imagine [huh] . 
B|87| M: [my] cat . she's [a] [big] [one .] 
A|88| A: [but] unemployment [now] [in] dallas or [in] texas [is] up around six point 
B|89| M: he's got [the] uhhhhh . 
A|90| A: [and] then [you] end up [with] [the] same [problem] [and] [you] take their leftover medicine that's [not] allowed . 
B|91| M: _how_ many [of those] [are] _from the_ towns ? 
A|92| A: uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [i] am [so] glad [you] [were] [able to] 
A|94| A: [you know] cutworms will [do the] same thing [to] [your] tomato vines [too] . 
B|95| M:  
A|96| A: _i'll_ [have] [to] admit [i don't] _i do_ [my] own yard . [i] [i] [really] [don't] enjoy doing [that .] [i] enjoy having [a] nice looking yard 
B|97| M: [well] [the] trial [is] [a] [bit] [of a] stretch . 
A|98| A: can [i] put [you] on hold [for] [one] minute ? 
B|99| M: [yeah] [and they] eat [the] tomatoes 
A|100| A: [oh] . 
B|101| M: [it's a] song . 
A|102| A: see that's we've [we] [had] [a] [problem] [with] [that .] 
B|103| M: [why] _do you_ hate [the] red lobster ? 
A|104| A: [i] [did] [too] [and] [you] [have a] [good] day .

B|109| M: [it's [not] that] [hard] . [they] [just] [don't] [have] [the] power [to] [do] [it .] 
A|110| A: [it's not] [really] [just] [to] getting [to] sight see .
