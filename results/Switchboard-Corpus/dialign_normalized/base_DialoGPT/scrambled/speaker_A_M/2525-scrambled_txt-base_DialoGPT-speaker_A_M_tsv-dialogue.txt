B|53| M: american ? 
A|54| A: okay , _well ,_ _there's_ , _uh_ , [it's] kind [of] an interesting topic [and] _one_ [that] [i think] [is] quite fascinating because , _uh_ , couple [of] years ago [, i] guess , _uh_ _, not_ very _, not_ very long ago , seemed [like] [the] whole world _, not_ [just] [the] united states , [but] [the] whole world _was_ kind [of] [in] [a] standstill [where] everyone _was_ basically [in] , _uh_ _, _you_ know_ , [a] very comfortable position [, so] [to] say , even though [the] _, the_ cold war _was_ , _was_ [in] full swing . _you know_ _, you_ [had] [the] _, the_ russians against [the] americans _, the_ communists against [the] free world [, and] [in] [the] last couple [of] years things [have] changed dramatically _, not_ [only] on [the] political front [but] also on [the] economic front , [where] , _uh_ , couple [of] years ago [we] [had] , _uh_ , america _was_ _one_ [of the] leading powers [and] _one_ [of the] strongest nations [in] [the] world as far as economics [were] concerned [, and] [now] [we're] having [a] very tough [time in] [a] recessionary period . [we're] also [have a] very humongous trade deficit [, [and] ,] _uh_ [, and] that's kind [of] frightening . also _, _you_ know_ , [a] couple [of] years ago , ten , fifteen , ten , fifteen years ago , an individual going [into] [a] career could expect [to] [have] [that] career basically throughout their whole life [, and] thirty years ago , [that] _was_ , [that] _was_ basically [it ,] whereas [now] [we're] expected [to] [have a] career change every _, _you_ know_ , every couple [of] years [and] possibly four [to] five career changes throughout our lifetime [, and] [so] [i think] , _uh_ _, _you_ know_ , things , _there's_ [been] an awful _lot of_ social change lately [, and] [and ,] _uh_ . 
B|55| M: [i'm] [sorry] [to] hear [that .] 
A|56| A: [and] [i'm] hoping especially [with] _those_ [big] tall sides on there [it] [that] maybe [i] won't [have] , _oh ,_ _i'll_ [have] less _of a_ bug [problem] at least [they] , [they'll] [have a] _hard_ [time] crawling up [the] thing .

A|64| A: [i mean ,] [it's] worked successfully [in] europe . 
B|65| M: [i] 
A|66| A: _they're_ _able to_ move [in] while _they're_ still independent [and] still social 
B|67| M: [yeah [,] and] [there's] ...

B|69| M: [are] [you] [in] [this] picture ? 
A|70| A: wow . 
B|71| M: _how_ _do [you_ know] [about that] ?

B|83| M: [they] [were] [the] _most_ popular [, and they] [were] [the first] [to] [be] popular 
A|84| A: [yeah [,] i] find [it] surprising . because [a lot of] times [, [it] ,] [here] _, [you_ know] , _i'll_ talk [to] some [people] [here] [and] _i'll_ mention someone's , some talk host [and] _i'll_ expect them [to] [have] an opinion on _why_ [i don't] [like] him [and] [don't] listen , [they] [don't] even [know] _, [you_ know] , [what] [the] guys name [is] , [uh] . bruce williams [who] [does] financial [work] [all] over [the] united states . [most] [people] haven't heard [of] bruce williams . [you] probably haven't either unless _you're_ [a] radio buff . 
B|85| M: _do you_ [mean] carpool ? 
A|86| A: [huh] . _well ,_ that's , _well ,_ [that] sounds interesting . matter [of] fact , [uh] [, i] guess [you] [do] , [uh] _, you_ [get] [a lot of] graphics [in] there [, i] imagine , [huh] . 
B|87| M: [my] cat . she's [a] [big] [one .] 
A|88| A: [but] , unemployment [now] [in] dallas , or [in] texas [is] up around six point , 
B|89| M: he's got [the] uhhhhh . 
A|90| A: [and] then [you] end up [with] [the] same [problem] [and] [you] take their leftover medicine , that's [not] allowed . 
B|91| M: _how_ many [of those] [are] _from the_ towns ? 
A|92| A: uh-huh .

B|97| M: [well [,] the] trial [is] [a] [bit] [of a] stretch . 
A|98| A: can [i] put [you] on hold [for] [one] minute ? 
B|99| M: [yeah [,] and they] eat [the] tomatoes

B|109| M: [it's [not] that] [hard] . [they] [just] [don't] [have] [the] power [to] [do] [it .] 
A|110| A: [it's not] [really] [just] [to] getting [to] sight see .
