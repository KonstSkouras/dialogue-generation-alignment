B|67| M: [so] 
A|68| A: [but] there wasn't [a] _it_ was strange _it_ was kind _of_ sad there wasn't [ever] [a] language [problem] there because everyone [in] germany knew english [and] everyone [in] switzerland knew english . 
B|69| M: [is it] [a] breeding [problem] ?

[so] [i] was actually actually [i'm not sure] [i] was [in] [i] was [in] iowa awhile ago [and] noticed [that] everything was an hour earlier [so] does [your] prime time start at seven o'clock ? 
B|81| M: 2 . 
A|82| A: [you] [would] still [have] something .

B|91| M: [are] [they] changing ? 
A|92| A: [and] [i] [don't] [know] if [they] decided [to] [do] or [not] [but [i] think] [they] said [it] was [going to] add like either [a] dollar or three [dollars] [a] month [to] [your] bill [to] [have] [them] [do] [that] . although [i think] [a] lot [of] those programs can operate at [about] [a] break even break even [point] without charging [people] .
