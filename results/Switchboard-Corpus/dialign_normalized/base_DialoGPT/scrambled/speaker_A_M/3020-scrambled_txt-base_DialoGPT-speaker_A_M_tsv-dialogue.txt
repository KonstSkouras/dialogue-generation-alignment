B|85| M: _they've_ [been] [in the] nfl since [the] 70s 
A|86| A: [um _,] yeah ,_ _right_ [in the] , [in the] lukewarm milk . sometimes [i] put [the] cornstarch [in a] separate bowl [and] [i] would put [it] [in the] sink [and] [i'll take] my lukewarm milk [and] put [it] [in the] cornstarch [and] beat [it] [good] _. it_ seems to be better than putting [the] , [the] cornstarch into [the] liquid [it] , once [it] hits [the] top _of the_ liquid [it] seems to make [little] balls [and] stuff [on the] top .
