A|64| A: [yeah ,] keep [it] there 
B|65| M:  
A|66| A: [uh ,] [in] parts [. [i] mean] [you] couldn't , [you] [really] couldn't use [it] _for_ [a] room . 
B|67| M: _i think_ _i _know_ ._ 
A|68| A: _i [,_ i'm] _serious_ . _and_ [i think] [that] [the] lawyers _have_ caused _a lot of_ [the] problems [that] exist [in the] [in the] criminal system today . with plea bargaining . 
B|69| M: [i'm] _not_ _sure _._ i don't _know_ ._ 
A|70| A: _and [,_ uh [,] [i] would] go [out] _and_ call _on_ farmers _and_ [i would] always try [to] look my best wearing sport coats _and_ things [like] [that] _, [but_ [i] was] calling _on_ guys [that] wore bib overalls . 
B|71| M: [you] _don't think_ ? 
A|72| A: [uh ,] [not] too much _. [uh_ [,] i] got [a bit] . actually , 
B|73| M: [you know [,] [that] .] 
A|74| A: [we] [had] about _, [a_ little] [bit] less than two weeks . 
B|75| M:  ? 
A|76| A: uh-huh . _well ,_ [they] , [they] _just don't_ [do] [that] _any_ [more] . 
B|77| M: [so] _what do_ [we] _do now_ ? 
A|78| A: [that] _don't ,_ [it] , [it] , [it] seems [like] [, [i] mean ,] [if] wrestling [is] prime _time_ , professional wrestling , [it] seems [like] [it's just ,] [just ,] [just] [like] pros [in a] wrestling [to] me [, _i] don't , [i_ don't] [see] _any_ difference though , 
B|79| M: hm ? [i don't] understand . 
A|80| A: uh-huh . 
B|81| M: [they] should [just] release [it] [on] [the] 14th . 
A|82| A: _and_ he's , [you know _,] _a_ lot of_ wisdom [in] [it .] _and_ [the] [kids] at bible talk about anything [but] training _, and_ training [is] different than anything else [in] , [in] psychology doesn't address [it .] _a lot of_ [the] psychology stuff [, the] [good] stuff _that's_ [in] psychology [it] [just] comes [out of] [the] bible _and_ [they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out of it] _, but_ [the] things [that] work [in] psychology other [the] years [that] they've proven [to] work , [they] [just] come [out of] [the] bible _and_ [so] [this] book [it] [just] [really] [all] these things _and_ _how_ [to] train [the] child [so] _they're_ [not] going [to] [be] [a] curse [to] [you] when _they're_ thirteen . 
B|83| M: uhh _, it's a_ cadillac 
A|84| A: [that] will [be] interesting . 
B|85| M: _it's a_ german shepherd [, so] _it's a_ breed . 
A|86| A: _and_ [i think] [it] [was] probably [one] [of] my largest eye-opening experiences because [i] come _from_ nice middle class [white] suburban home 
B|87| M:  ... 
A|88| A: [yeah .] 
B|89| M: [are you] [serious] ? 
A|90| A: [that] [would be] [really] great . 
B|91| M: [what] [is _that] ?_ 
A|92| A: _and ,_ [you know ,] [just ,] [you] [see] _a lot of_ things [like] [you ,] [you know ,] [was] [a] great golfer _and_ wanted [to] play golf when _he_ retired _, and_ [you know] [that] _a lot of_ [the] things _he_ thought _he_ [would] [do] when _he_ retired he's [not] able [to] [do now] . 
B|93| M: _i don't think_ [they can] [be] a'school '

B|103| M: [yeah [,] i] 
A|104| A: uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [i] 
A|106| A: [you know ,] _you're_ dooming _them_ [to] ghetto life or whatever . _and_ [i know] [that] [, that] [the] southeast asians [, the] hmong [people] [that] [i've] done [some] work with [, uh ,] feel very quite hurt _and , and_ unsure [of] themselves when [here] . because _they're_ coming _from_ , [you know ,] _from_ [the] slash _and_ burn intercultural society , [you know _,] they're_ coming _from_ [the] middle ages , basically . _and_ _they're_ _being_ plunked down , plunked down into america . many [of] _them_ [had] [been] promised by [the] c [i] _a ,_ during [the] war _over_ there [, that] because [they] co-operated with [the] c [i] _a _,_ and_ [they] helped [the] c [i] [a] [out] [, that] when [they] came [here] [, the] c [i] [a] [would] [help] establish _them_ [in] america _, and_ [the] c [i] _a ,_ [of] course , isn't doing [that .] 
B|107| M:  
A|108| A: [uh ,] [i've] , [i've] [said] _for_ years [that] there's full employment _for_ [the] politically active _and_ [in] [our] society [, uh ,] there's very [little] full employment . most [people] [in] [this] country [are] getting worse [off] , [not] better [off] . 
B|109| M: [yeah] ,? 
A|110| A: uh-huh . 
B|111| M:  
A|112| A: uh-huh .

A|120| A: [what] , [what do you] [do] ? 
B|121| M: [i'm] _sure_ 
A|122| A: [it] [was] [a] joy [in] talking with [you] . 
B|123| M:  
A|124| A: _and_ [we've] _, we have_ [been to] whistler [in] canada , which [is] [just a] marvelous [place ,] whistler _and_ black home [is] [in] canada _, and_ [then] [we've] gone [to] sun valley several times , _that's_ _a ,_ [just a] great _place [._ but] no [not] [in] colorado [since] [i [was] in] college , [since] [i] went [to] [school] , 
B|125| M: [so] [you're] saying [you] [don't] _like [it_ ?] 
A|126| A: [yeah ,] [it] [is [,] [i] mean [,] [i] would] [never] buy [it] [but] leasing [it] [is] fine . 
B|127| M: [i'm] [not] _sure_ _, i think_ [they] were [like] three _fifty_ . 
A|128| A: anyway [, it's a] tough question . 
B|129| M: [he] smiles [and] smiles back 
A|130| A: [sure .]

B|139| M: uhh [, uh [,] they're] _all over the_ [place .] 
A|140| A: [yeah [,] that] must [have] [been] at least [fifty] years ago or [more] [, but] [the] point [of] [the] story [is that] [, that] [was] [so] unbelievable [a] [thing] [in] those days [that] [it] [was in] [all] [the] papers , [all over the] country _for_ weeks 
B|141| M:  
A|142| A: [yeah ,] ours [is] [on] ,

B|145| M: [it's a] joke
