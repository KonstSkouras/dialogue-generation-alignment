B|45| M: [i think] [he] _was_ [a] dog [he] _was_ [the] most loving [the] most obedient cat [i] [ever] had . 
A|46| A: [so] then [that] [so] [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion then .

[it's] not [her] favorite place [to] be [in] . she'd much [rather] be here with me . but when [it] got [to] [the] point [i] [was] spending more time at [the] hospital with [her] 
B|55| M: [no] [. i] want [to] see [the] eggs hatch 
A|56| A: [so] depending on [what] my class schedule looks like [he] may spend four anywhere from four [to] eight hours [a] day [in] child care at [that] point . [right] now we're trying [to] avoid [it] but we [just] as [a] matter [of] fact [just] yesterday hired [a] [a] [girl] [to] uh _watch_ him . uh [i] [get] out [of] class at certain time [and] my wife [is] already supposed [to] be on [her] way [to] [her] class _. [you_ know] once [a] day this overlap happens where we can't one [of] us be home .
