B|35| M: yep . 
A|36| A: [not] _this_ past fall [but] [i] mean fall , [a] few years [, i] mean _, it_ [it] _was_ [in the] , yeah _, it_ _was_ almost _like_ october [of] eighty-five , 
B|37| M: [it's] [not] _, it's_ [just] [, it] _is ._ 
A|38| A: _right ._ 
B|39| M: [is] [that] [the] _place_ [in the] middle _of the_ picture ? 
A|40| A: [so] [you're] , [you're] [not] [that] far north _then_ , okay . 
B|41| M: [i] _can't_ help [but] read [this] [in the] voice _of the_ dude who's _been_ trying [to] convince everyone he's [a] vampire . 
A|42| A: yeah . yeah . 
B|43| M: [how] [about] [you] ? 
A|44| A: _well ,_ _that ,_ 
B|45| M: _i guess_ [that's] [one] way _to do_ [it] . 
A|46| A: yeah . 
B|47| M: wait [, _what] ?_ 
A|48| A: uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [so] _are you_ _saying_ [that] _they are_ _going [to_ be] rehabilitated ? 
A|50| A: [that] stress [is] [a] very prominent factor [in the] work [place] [and] [it] affects , 
B|51| M: _they are_ [all] friends _with the_ same [person] . 
A|52| A: [but] [i think] everybody [if] [they] were touched by [it] _would_ [say] , [if] [they] _had_ any sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [, [i] think] every human does [, [i] think] they'd [say] , yeah , 
B|53| M: [i'm] [a] girl . 
A|54| A: [and] [the] only other avenue [that] [i] _can_ [think] [of] [is] _, uh ,_ looking at where they're spending [the] [money] [and] [not] [so] much as [saying] , _well ,_ _we're_ spending too much [in] [that] area as perhaps looking at [what] [is] costing _them_ [the] [money] . as _for_ , _for_ instance [, [i] _think] you_ _probably_ remember [the] military getting caught , um , [with] toilet seats [that] cost _them_ four hundred , five hundred dollars . 
B|55| M: _some of them_ [are] [just] _going [to_ be] [on the] internet forever . 
A|56| A: _we_ were wondering [if] [they] _, uh ,_ [they] _had_ any special [law] _for_ [the] horses [in] central park . 
B|57| M: _oh _,_ uh _, i've got_ a_ paper bag . 
A|58| A: yeah 
B|59| M: [it's] [a] _nice_ [place] [to] live . 
A|60| A: yeah . [i ,] as [i think] [i] mentioned [, i] _was_ [in the] trust business [and] [i've] seen [so] many elderly people . usually there has [to be] [some] wealth involved , which [is] great , [if] , [if] [you're] financially , [if] , [if you] [don't] make [the] decisions [so] late [that] [you're] worried [about] [money] [but] [the] _, the_ places _like_ presbyterian village [and] [some [of] the] _, the_ retirement places where , where [they] [have] different levels [of] care seems [to be] [so] much better , as far as elderly people adapting . 
B|61| M: uhhh [, i would] [be] hung _up_ [on the] lincoln . 
A|62| A: um . 
B|63| M: [we] [got] [the first] pick [in the] nfc east [, and] [then] [we] _got a_ qb [that] [wasn't] [even] [the first] overall pick . 
A|64| A: uh-huh . 
B|65| M:  
A|66| A: [i] found [that] out . [i] mean [, you] _know _,_ the_ people [would] [just] sort [of] look at me _like_ [, you] must [be] crazy when [i ,] went [in] [to] [, and] asked [and] [that] _was_ [a] requirement _so ,_ 
B|67| M:  
A|68| A: _i don't know ,_ 
B|69| M: [well [,] the] _car_ [was] designed [for] air pollution [so _,] no_ _, it's_ [probably] [not] [a] _good_ design . 
A|70| A: at any rate [we] came back [here] [with] , my husband [was] transferred [around] [, uh ,] [up] [to] minnesota [and] now back [to] texas [with] t [i] 
B|71| M: [you] [, uh ,] _might_ _want to_ check _your_ math . 
A|72| A: [they] [just] [say] [do] [you] believe [in] such [and] such . [uh ,] 
B|73| M: uuhuh . uhuh . 
A|74| A: yeah . [we] [have] [some of them] [around] [here] . [you] [probably] [have] more there , though [, i would] imagine . 
B|75| M: [how] did [you] [learn] [, uh] . [learn] ? 
A|76| A: thirty day notice [for] [what ?] 
B|77| M: [i'm] sorry 
A|78| A: _oh ._ 
B|79| M: [i] hate rain . 
A|80| A: yeah . 
B|81| M: [i [,] uh ,] [know] . 
A|82| A: [i guess] _that [,_ i] mean [it] [all] depends really [on] [what] kind [of] bracket [you're] [in] . 
B|83| M: [yes .] 
A|84| A: [i _know] _,_ i love_ mine too _. well _,_ it's been_ [nice] talking [to] [you] . 
B|85| M: [i love] running [, i love] exercise [, i'm] [a] runner [, i] [just] [like] running . 
A|86| A: now [i think] maybe [it's] started changing [in the] past few years [because] [, uh ,] [they] [have] [of] these [, uh ,] sort [of] mandatory tests [if you] [have] [to] take before [you] get [a] diploma . 
B|87| M: _no_ , [not] family 
A|88| A: [and] [you] [want to] _use_ [one] [of] [your] [good] sauce pans [that] dissipate [the] heat [because] [it] [, it] ends [up] burning [, i] mean [, no] matter [how] careful [you [are] you] still [might] get [a] film [on the] bottom [of the] pot . 
B|89| M: [but] [we're] [not] [in the] uk 
A|90| A: uh-huh . [it] [sure] [is .] [the] [, you] _know ,_ as far as [, [i] think] there [was] something [with the] government official [that] went [on] conferences [for] two days [and] actually [, uh [,] the] conferences were nothing [but] [, uh [,] you] _know ,_ they're getting paid [for] [this] [, and] [it] [was] something more than [just] [the] conferences . [they] were using [it] as eating out [, uh ,] when [you] [think] [about] people [, uh ,] taking vacations these _big_ government officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|91| M: [is] [it] [just] [bad] ? 
A|92| A: [i _know] [,_ and] [, uh [,] the] police [are] [not] [going [to] do] [anything] until [they] , they've committed [some] sort _of a_ crime . [you] _know ,_ he [was] [just] begging her [on the] phone , [that's] [not] [doing] [anything] . 
B|93| M: [that] sounds [good] . 
A|94| A: [oh ,] gosh , chris xeros [you] grew [up] [with] his children , too , [then] ? 
B|95| M: [i don't know [,] it's _been] a_ while since we've [had] [a big problem] [with] [it] . 
A|96| A: [uh ,] [oh ,] [of] course , [of] course [they are] . [they] [want] [you] [to] buy their [car] . yeah , there [, it] [was] [, it] [was] interesting . [i] [was] at [, [i ,] i] also went [to] [, uh [,] the] porsche [and] [, uh [,] it] [was] [, it] [was] amazing [how] [they] were completely opposed . 
B|97| M: [i] 
A|98| A: [the] [i think] [the] _, i guess_ [the] only _real_ , um , benefit [i guess] [you] could [say] working , [for] me working [here] , besides [i] mean [i'm] learning [and] stuff [because] [, i'm] at [, you] [know ,] [in] school . 
B|99| M: [you] 
A|100| A: [yes .] 
B|101| M: [then] ,, [that [,] and] ? 
A|102| A: [and] [, uh , i've got] carrots [, i] [yes] [, i've got a] few carrots [up] [and] [i've got] [some] radishes [up] , 
B|103| M: [i] dunno . 
A|104| A: [and] [i] thought [, you] [know ,] [that] really , now [that] [i'm] thirty years old [, [i] think] [that] [one] or two years out [of] my _life_ [would] [have] , [probably] [like] [you] [said ,] [to be] able [to] travel [some] [place] else whether [it] [be] [the] united states or outside [the] country [, [i] think] [it] [would] [have] [been a] very [good] , um , experience [for] me . 
B|105| M: [i don't [think] you] [can] [use] [the] gun [with] [a] gun [in] [it] . 
A|106| A: um [, i] [have] [no] idea . 
B|107| M: [and] [that's] why [i] don'think [it's] [going to] fix [anything] 
A|108| A: [but] . [that] [is] [a] very [good] point . [i am] from west virginia [so] [i] understand [what] [you are] [saying] there 
B|109| M: [oh [.] [well [,] i] guess] [you're] [right .] 
A|110| A: uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [it's] [like] [a] [real] [life] version [of a] movie . 
A|112| A: [and] [, you] [know [,] you] [can't] get [a] golden retriever near water without [it] jumping [in] .
