B|10| M: [you] don't _have to_ [wear] [it] . 
A|11| A: yeah _, i think_ [in] today's society [, uh ,] there is more credibility [to] be quite honest 
B|12| M: _you're_ 
A|13| A: [i] will always remember _, i_ will tell this real quick story when [i] graduated _from_ college , _my_ first _job_ years ago [, uh ,] thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago , [in] fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer .

B|20| M:  
A|21| A: _and_ _he_ sort [of] expected me [to] _dress_ as [a] professional 
B|22| M: uhh , _what_ did [he] expect ? 
A|23| A: so [, uh ,] [it] was sort [of] , 
B|24| M: _no_ [it] wasn't 
A|25| A: [you] bet even _back_ then 
B|26| M: [he] didn't expect [you] [to] come [back] .

B|28| M: she _does_ . 
A|29| A: _but_ _here_ again [i] _dress_ casual quite [a] bit so , 
B|30| M:  ... [and] [here] [i am ,] sitting _in [my_ dress] . 
A|31| A: _it gives you_ _confidence ._ [in my] business _if_ _i call_ on [the] [the] j c penney company [here] [in] dallas or say someone say sears [and] roebuck [in] chicago , then [i] [wear] coat [and] tie . _if_ _i call_ on just [, uh ,] [a] normal little dealer [of] mine _, i_ might be casual .

A|33| A: _i call_ on oshman's sporting goods , again , [it] may be casual or [it] may be coat [and] tie . so [it] depends . 
B|34| M: _what about_ [the] jacket ? 
A|35| A: [uh ,] probably [no] . 
B|36| M: _are_ [you] 
A|37| A: _but_ then [it] depends on who [you] [are] calling on . who [you're] _, you_ [like] your minister standing up [in] front [of] [you] with [no] tie _, you_ just [, uh ,] [he] [would] be missing something . 
B|38| M: [i call] [it] [the] . 
A|39| A: although , [he] shouldn't be evaluated on _that_ . 
B|40| M: _but you_ can see [the] difference between [the] two 
A|41| A: so _, it's_ its' just different . 
B|42| M: because [, you know ,] he's _not_ . 
A|43| A: yes , [it] is . [i am [,] uh ,] [like] [a] catholic [and] [the] people _that_ go [to] [my] church [, you know] catholics [dress] _very_ casual [a] lot [of] [the] times . people [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever , [but] yet [the] way [i] was raised _, [i_ am] [a] converted catholic , [the] way [i] was raised _, i_ was raised [a] baptist [and] [like] as [a] youngster [i] use [to] always [dress] up all [the] time . _i guess_ _that_ has changed also .

A|51| A: [and] [it's] [it's a very] good point . 
B|52| M: [no] [, it's] _not_ . 
A|53| A: [but you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|54| M: [i] don't [know [,] i think] [it's] pretty cool . 
A|55| A: [and] [, uh ,] evaluation [of] an individual . course , all [of] [it] depends on [the] type [of] _job_ responsibility [you] [have] . [i _think] you_ [have to] [dress] sort [of] accordingly . 
B|56| M: [i] don't [think you] [understand] [the] concept [of] [a] [job] . 
A|57| A: [but] [, uh [,] you] certainly should [not] judge [a] book by its cover [and] [, uh ,] or evaluate [a] person by [that] . 
B|58| M: oh . [well] _, i guess_ [you're] [right .] 
A|59| A: [what about] _season to_ _season_ . [does] [, i guess] your [dress] changes . 
B|60| M: [it] varies [from] [season to] seasons .
