A|8| A: [i know] some _of_ _my_ friends who _have_ pets _, uh [,_ and] they [just] are really _, you know ,_ _the_ ones _that_ _have_ dogs are very _, uh ,_ protective _of_ them [and] _i think_ _that's_ one _reason_ they _have_ them , especially older people _that_ [i _know] ,_ _that_ _have_ pets . _but_ they [just] , um , really take care _of_ them , or _, uh ,_ are protective _of_ them . 
B|9| M: _that ,_

A|20| A: [yeah ,] _that's_ _true ._ 
B|21| M: yes , _it's_ 
A|22| A: [yeah ,] _that's_ _true ._ take them _for_ walks _, right_ . [yeah , i] see all [the] people on , on sunday going _for_ [a] walk with their dogs _and [,_ and] [i] , _i'm_ kind [of] skeptical with [my] son getting [a] [dog] , _i'm_ [like] [i know] _it_ will be fun [the] first week maybe , 
B|23| M: no .

A|26| A: oh , [that's] exciting . [yeah] . 
B|27| M: [so] 
A|28| A: [yeah _, i] think_ [it's] really important to [that ,] [that] if [you] get [a pet] [that] they're either spayed or neutered [so] [that _,] you know ,_ we're not [just] going on with this [pet] population [and] having to , [just] get rid [of] them .

A|32| A: more [and] more people are _, right_ _, right_ . 
B|33| M:  ... 
A|34| A: [but] _, uh ,_ 
B|35| M: [and , uh , i think] [, you know [,] and] 
A|36| A: [i think] [that's] really _true ._ 
B|37| M: [the] best part _is_ [when] [you] realize [it's] [true .] 
A|38| A: [yeah] . 
B|39| M: [i'm] [sorry .] 
A|40| A: [yeah ,] exactly . 
B|41| M: [you're] talking about [the] kittens [, right] ? 
A|42| A: exactly . [i think] our _community_ [is] [a lot] more conscious [now] _though_ too [, [and] [,] and] [that's] good too . 
B|43| M: [it's] still [a lot] [better] than [the] [community] . 
A|44| A: well [, i think] [that's] all [i] [have] to say . 
B|45| M: [it's] fine . thanks [for] [the] talk [though] 
A|46| A: okay , [have a] good night . all [right] , bye-bye .
