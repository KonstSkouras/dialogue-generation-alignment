B|28| M: _when_ _did he_ die ? 
A|29| A: [and] lord knows _what happened to him_ . _he's probably_ been through all kinds [of] nightmares .

B|38| M: [i know it's] _crazy_ i'm [a] _vet_ tech .

B|40| M: [i think] _he was_ _a dog_ _he was the_ most loving [the] most obedient [cat] [i] _ever_ [had] . 
A|41| A: [i] wonder [how many] [of his] lives [he] missed [when] [that] _happened_ . 
B|42| M: [my] cat's name _is_ tom _and he_ loves _to play with_ [the] kids . 
A|43| A: _oh_ [i] can imagine _what did he_ shoot _him_ [with] . 
B|44| M:  ... _i don't_ [think] [i've] _ever_ _seen_ [a] picture [of] [him] [in] [my] _life_ . 
A|45| A: _oh my_ gosh . people [are] [crazy] . 
B|46| M: [what did he] [do] ?

B|48| M: i'm not gonna lie [i] cried . 
A|49| A: _oh_ man . 
B|50| M: _he _is_ a_ kitten ! 
A|51| A: [i] imagine . [they] usually [are] after something _like that_ happens [to] [them] . [it] seems [to] mellow [them] or something . 
B|52| M: [how] _is [the_ cat] _getting_ [so] much food ? 
A|53| A: [no] . 
B|54| M: _and [you_ know] [that] _they are_ [cats .] 
A|55| A: _oh_ yeah [i] [i] keep talking _about_ [getting] rid [of my] outdoor [cats] _because_ [i] feel _like_ [i don't] _i can't_ _take_ _care_ [of] [them] as [well] _because_ [they're] outside 
B|56| M: [i think] [you're] _thinking_ _of the_ [cats .] 
A|57| A: [and] [it] worries _me_ [that] [one] _day_ [one] [of] [them] won't come back 
B|58| M: [i have] [a] [cat] [it's] _okay_ . 
A|59| A: [and i] feel _like_ [they] [need] [a big] home _a nice_ place where someone can [have] [the] time [to play with] [them] [and] things . _but _i_ can't_ give [them] up . 
B|60| M: [you] _should_ _just_ _get_ [a] [cat .] 
A|61| A: [i] [just] [i] go hysterical [when] [they] [don't] come home . 
B|62| M: [this] _is_ [so] confusing 
A|63| A: _oh_ _oh_ yeah [and] every time [you] [see] [one] hit _on the_ side [of the] road [you] [say] _is that my_ [cat .] 
B|64| M: [but] [you] [don't] [need] [to] worry [about] [the [cat] .] 
A|65| A: [and you] go [crazy] [thinking] [it] might [be] yours . 
B|66| M: i'm going [crazy] 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| M: [what] ? i'm [just] saying [i've] [never] _had a_ [cat] [that was] [just] _that ._ 
A|69| A: ugh ! 
B|70| M: [i don't] [want] _to make_ _any_ promises [but] i'm going _to take_ [a] bath [with] [a] bath . 
A|71| A: really . 
B|72| M: [oh my] . 
A|73| A: [it's] here now [we have to] keep [it .] yeah [my] [my] first [one] [that] [i] _got_ [i had] [just] moved away _from_ home [and] _got_ [my] [own] apartment . [it] took _me_ [about] two weeks [to] realize [that was] real lonely . 
B|74| M: [you're] not alone . 
A|75| A: [so] [i] found [this] [one] [and] uh actually [it] [was] _on_ [a] sign [at] taco bell drive-thru [that] _said_ _free_ _kittens ._ 
B|76| M: _i'll_ [take] [the] [free] kitten 
A|77| A: [and i] thought [well] _that's_ interesting [i'll] call [them] . 
B|78| M: yup . i'm [from] [there .] 
A|79| A: [and [he] was the] _only_ [one] _left_ [and] [his] _mother_ [had] been killed coming back across [the] road [to make] _sure_ she'd gotten all her _kittens ._ 
B|80| M: _he was the last one_ _but [he_ was] [only] [there] [for] [a] couple [of] days . 
A|81| A: [and [he] was the last one] _she_ carried across [you know] [the] whole [big] [sad] story . 
B|82| M: [i don't] [think] [he was] [a] baby [he was] [just] [the last] person [she] [had] [on the] street . 
A|83| A: [so] [of] course [i had [to] take] [him] [. i] felt [so] _sorry for_ [him] after [that .] 
B|84| M: [i] [didn't] [know] [he [was] so] cruel . 
A|85| A: [and [he] is] uh [you] can _tell_ [he was] weaned _too_ young _because_ he'll nurse [on] [your] ears [and] [your] fingers . 
B|86| M: [i mean] [he was] born [with] [a] _head_ . 
A|87| A: yeah [he] [i] asked [the] [vet] why [he] [did] [that] [and he] _said_ [he was] [probably] weaned _too_ young which [he was] _because_ [his] mom [was] killed [so] . 
B|88| M: i'm [sorry for] [your] loss [. i] hope [you] _get_ better soon . 
A|89| A: [but [he] [is] the] lovingest [cat .] everybody people [who] [don't] _even_ _like_ _cats like_ [him] . 
B|90| M: i'm [sorry] [to] hear [that .] 
A|91| A: [he] [never] meows [he] _he doesn't_ [have] [any] front claws [i had] [him] declawed 
B|92| M: [he's] adorable [what happened to him] ? 
A|93| A: _but he doesn't bite_ anybody [he's] [just] [he's] [just] kind [of] [there] real friendly [and] docile . 
B|94| M: [but he doesn't bite] anyone . 
A|95| A: [oh] yeah yeah [we] [do] [we] call [that] doing biscuits
