B|53| M: _yeah i_ don'like [that .] 
A|54| A: [oh] _you do_ okay [yeah .] [i] [have a] _really_ easy recipe _for that_ where [you] [just] brown [the] _chicken_ _and then you_ put _rice_ _in_ [the] bottom [of] _the pan_ [you] pour bouillon or _chicken_ broth over [it] 
B|55| M: ah [. well] [i don't] [really] [like [it] .]

B|57| M: [you] _can't_ just'put'the [chicken] into [the pan] _. _you_ have_ to'put [it] in'it ' . 
A|58| A: [yeah] over uncooked _rice_ 
B|59| M: [you] mean [rice] ? 
A|60| A: _and you can_ either _microwave it_ or _do it_ _in_ [the] oven [and] [it] [just] . 
B|61| M: [and you can] [microwave it] 
A|62| A: [it] fluffs up [and] [it's] [really] moist . 
B|63| M: _i've_ never seen [it] [like that] _before_ . how [is] [it ?] 
A|64| A: uh-huh wow [yeah .] 
B|65| M: _i think it's_ _just a_ weird coincidence . 
A|66| A: uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|67| M: [yeah .] 
A|68| A: [well] _i'll_ keep [that] one _in_ mind . 
B|69| M: you'll _get_ [the] same result [when] [you] _cook_ [it .] 
A|70| A: [yeah .] 
B|71| M: [you] mean [to] say ... 
A|72| A: [yeah .] 
B|73| M:  ... [i don't] _know_ ... 
A|74| A: uh-huh . [yeah] [you can] _get away_ _with_ [it] even [having a] semi nice dinner 
B|75| M: [i don't] _know_ . 
A|76| A: or [you] [know] semi . 
B|77| M: [i] mean [you] _can't_ [really] [do] [that] [with] [a] spoon 
A|78| A: [yeah .] 
B|79| M: [i] mean [if you] wanted [to] [i] could [get away] from [it .] 
A|80| A: [yeah [.] you] put _in_ um 
B|81| M: _but_ ... [i don't] [have] any . 
A|82| A: _let's _see_ what_ [was] [it] three quarters [of] _cup _of_ rice_ or 
B|83| M: _i think_ [so] . [let's see] 
A|84| A: [it] depends on [you can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|85| M: [i] dont [know] how many _cups_ [of rice] ? 
A|86| A: [but] [you _have] to_ put [the] _water in_ proportionally . [i] [can't] remember . [i think] [it] [was] three quarters _cup_ [rice] [to] two [cups] _water_ two [cups] um broth . 
B|87| M: [i don't] [think] _i've_ ever had [a] [cup of] [water in] [a] bath . 
A|88| A: [yeah] flavor . uh-huh . [yeah .]

A|90| A: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: mmmmmm taste . 
A|92| A: um [let's see] . [i think] [it] [was] an hour . [i've] [done] [it] [in] [the] [microwave] [so] often lately [because] [it's] [it's] [really] easy . 
B|93| M: [oh] [i] [know] . [it's] _a little_ ... spicy . 
A|94| A: [yeah [.] [but] [i] think it's] [about] an hour . 
B|95| M: [so] [you do] [the] same thing [and then you] [microwave [it] ?] 
A|96| A: or maybe [it's] only half hour . um [you] [just] until [the] [rice] looks fluffy [and] [and] _not_ overdone [. you] [know] [before] [it] gets overdone . 
B|97| M: [that's a] great [idea .] [i'll] [do it] 
A|98| A: [yeah .] 
B|99| M: [i] mean [it's] [just] [chicken] . 
A|100| A: um i'd let [it] [cook] [just [a] little bit] [just] [so] [that] _the cooking_ goes [a little] faster . 
B|101| M: [yeah] [i'm] gonna [have to] [do] [that .] 
A|102| A: [yeah i] liked your [idea] [too] there . 
B|103| M: yea . [i'll] [have to] [see what] [i] [can] [do] . [it's] [a] [bit] hard [to make] [the cooking] go [a little] quicker 
A|104| A: uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [but] ... [it's] [not] [a] soup . 
A|106| A: [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|107| M: ummm ... how [do] [you] [make] soup ? 
A|108| A: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [it's] [a] thing
