A|40| A: [well] _that's good ._ [well] _we_ um let's _see_ [the] only [other] [place] [i've] ever vacationed we'd _you know_ [go] on camping trips up [to] texoma [and] things [like] [that .] 
B|41| M: _i don't_ [know] maybe . 
A|42| A: _and then_ [i] went [to] england [a few] years ago . 
B|43| M:  ... [and then] ? 
A|44| A: [i _was] a_ _student_ _there_ [and] spent um [a] semester studying abroad [in] london . 
B|45| M: _what_ [was] [the] school ? 
A|46| A: [and] [that] _was a_ great time because _it's so_ [that's] such [a] neat [place] [and] [it's] there's [not a] _language_ barrier [so] [you] [don't] [i] [mean] _there_ there's [a] little bit because there's [some] [of] those english words [that] [you] [just] [don't] exactly [know] [what] [they] [mean] [and _a] lot_ [of] _people_ [have] trouble wrestling _with_ their accents but [it's] _it was_ [really] [fun [.] i] [i] [i] [really] enjoyed [that [.] i'm] probably [going] back _there_ [to] work _for a_ year . 
B|47| M: [fun .] 
A|48| A: [it] [it's] [really] [nice] [. i] [would] [i] [would] spend all _my_ time [in] london or _most_ _of my_ time 
B|49| M: [i] 
A|50| A: [and] [that's] _it was_ [really] different being [in] [a big] city because [i don't] _get_ much into urban _you know_ [really] urban areas _a lot_ 
B|51| M: [i] 
A|52| A: [and] _it was_ [it's] [really] [it's] sort [of] [a] weird little anonymous feeling _where_ [no] one knows who [you are] [and] [you] can spend [a] whole day without talking [to] anyone which [i] thought [i] [would] [just] hate but [it] ended up being kind [of] [nice] because [you're not] accountable [to] anyone . 
B|53| M: [no] 
A|54| A: [you] could [just] kind [of] kind [of] walk around [and] observe 
B|55| M: [you] 
A|56| A: [i] _did_ _a lot_ [of] [just] [going] _out_ by myself [and] riding on [the] subway [and] watching _people_ . 
B|57| M: _why_ [not] [just] [go] [out] [to] [the] [park] ? 
A|58| A: [and] [i] had [a] great time doing [that .] _it was_ [really] interesting . 
B|59| M: [yeah [.] you] [do] [have to] [talk] [to] [other] [people] _to get_ [the] message across though . 
A|60| A: [yeah] _i know_ 
B|61| M: [i've] [been] [going] _to see_ [it] _for a while_ now . [it's so] awesome . 
A|62| A: [i] keep wanting [to get] up [to] [i] haven't [i] haven't [been] anywhere else outside [the] united states [. i] haven't [been to] mexico or _canada_ or 
B|63| M: [that] sounds [really] cool . 
A|64| A: [oh] . 
B|65| M: [i] live [in] [canada] 
A|66| A: [yeah] [that] [would be] [nice] [. i] had [a] friend [from] _there_ . 
B|67| M: [i'm] [from] [canada] [i know] [where] [it] [is] . 
A|68| A: [then] [i] i'd love [to go] somewhere [in] asia but i'd [have to] [have] [a] tour guide _with_ _me_ [to] help _with_ all [the] _language_ [and] all [that .] 
B|69| M: [that's good .] 
A|70| A: [so] [yeah] [that's] [why] [that's] [why] england _was nice_ . even _we_ traveled [in] europe [for] [about] [a] week [and] [that] [was] even [nice] because _there_ wasn't uh _the most_ [the] places _we_ went _we_ went [to] germany [and] switzerland [and] 
B|71| M: [oh] 
A|72| A: [yeah] _we_ [have] . _we_ . _we_ _did_ _we_ whirlwinded through europe . 
B|73| M: [that] [is] [a lot] 
A|74| A: _it was_ [just] insane twelve days [where] we'd [just] stop [like] [a] city [a] day [and] [you] slept on [the] train [at] night . 
B|75| M: [you know] 
A|76| A: but _there_ wasn't [a] _it was_ strange _it was_ kind [of] sad _there_ wasn't ever [a] _language_ _problem_ _there_ because everyone [in] germany knew english [and] everyone [in] switzerland knew english . 
B|77| M: [i was] [in the] middle [of] [the] bus [at the] end [of my] shift [there] [was a] [problem] [with] german 
A|78| A: [so] _we were_ kind [of] pitiful . _we_ found one restaurant _we were_ [in] [and] got seated [and then] [no] one knew english [in] [there] _and we were_ [just] finally had [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking up things . 
B|79| M: [is] [it] [just] bad ? 
A|80| A: but _it was_ 
B|81| M: [that's] [what] [you're] supposed [to] [do] [with] your first [language] [not] your first meal . 
A|82| A: [oh] [i] had fondue . [that] [was] easy [to] say 
B|83| M: [what] _was it_ ? 
A|84| A: tried [to get] fondue [and] white wine [and] [that] [was] 
B|85| M: [i don't] [think] [you] [did] 
A|86| A: _we were_ [able to] [have] [that] [pretty] [pretty] effortlessly . [there] [were] [some] [people] [at the] next table who spoke english [so] _we_ elicited their aid [for a while] 
B|87| M:  ... how [do] [you] [do] this ? 
A|88| A: [and] [they] _were very_ helpful 
B|89| M: [and we [were] very] friendly 
A|90| A: [so] _it [was_ _it] [was_ a] pleasant time . 
B|91| M: [i know] [it was] 
A|92| A: i'd i'd love [to go] back [there] . there's [just] [not] time there's [not] enough time [to go] [see] everything [and then] [to] afford [to see] everything . 
B|93| M: [i] dont 
A|94| A: _right_ . [that's] 
B|95| M: [i know] [right] ? 
A|96| A: [that] [and] sleeping late 
B|97| M: [i'm] [a] college [student] [so [i] have] [no] money . 
A|98| A: [i] keep hoping [for] . 
B|99| M: this [is] [the most] important [thing] [for] [me] . 
A|100| A: [well] _it was nice_ talking [with] [you] . 
B|101| M: [it was nice] meeting [you] [too] 
A|102| A: [and] [have] [a] [good] afternoon . 
B|103| M: [good] morning sir . 
A|104| A: okay . 
B|105| M: [no] [i'm] sorry .
