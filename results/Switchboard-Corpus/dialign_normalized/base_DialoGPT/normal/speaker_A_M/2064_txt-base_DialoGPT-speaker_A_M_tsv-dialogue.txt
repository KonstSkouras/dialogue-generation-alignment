A|41| A: _because_ _i know_ _they_ [do] frequently _, _i_ mean_ _they_ cover , cover [it] _pretty_ heavily on television _and the_ newspaper .

B|44| M: [do you think] they'll ever _stop_ ? 
A|45| A: _yeah ._ 
B|46| M: [so] [the] [appeal] [is] [for] [a] while ? 
A|47| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . [so] [is [it] _,] uh ,_ _are_ _we_ doing lethal injection _now_ ? 
B|48| M: [and _the] jury_ _will_ _decide_ [that .] 
A|49| A: uh-huh , which seems [so] awful . 
B|50| M: [it's a] long story . 
A|51| A: [so] [, it's _a] little_ _bit more_ humane _, i_ guess , [it] [is] , 
B|52| M: [yeah] [, uh ,] [no .] 
A|53| A: [yes _,] _the_ other_ one _just_ seems [so] terrible . 
B|54| M: [well [,] it's] [still] [a] [bit more] painful [than] [the other] . 
A|55| A: um . 
B|56| M: _no [, i_ don't] [think] [so] 
A|57| A: [well ,] [do you think] [that] _we_ [do] [it] _because we_ want [it] [to] deter _crime_ or [, [it's] not] _because _we_ don't_ want [to] pay [for] inmates [to] stay _in_ prison ? 
B|58| M: [yes [,] it's] [because we] [are] paying [for] them . 
A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [that's] _what_ [they] said _, but_ [it's] [because] [they] [don't] _have a_ problem 
A|61| A: um . 
B|62| M: _what_ [do you] [mean] ? 
A|63| A: _yes ._ 
B|64| M: [so] [are] [you] saying [that] [they] [are going to be] rehabilitated ? 
A|65| A: um . [well ,] um [, and] [i] notice [that] _the crime_ rate [was] _up_ _in the_ _dallas_ _area_ [it's] [, it's] kind [of] _been_ scary , [to] [think] _about it_ 
B|66| M: [not] [in the] [area] i'm [in] . 
A|67| A: [and] [, and] _you're_ hoping [there] [is] something [that] [will] cut _down_ on [that .] 
B|68| M: [yes [.] but] . [yes .] [it [.] is] . [up] . [to] . [now] . [if] [. _but] [,_ [the] crime] [is] [down] . 
A|69| A: [you] _hate to_ [have] [the] dubious honor [of] being _, you know _,_ so_ high [in the] , [in] statistics , 
B|70| M: _i _hate_ to be_ [that] guy _, but_ what's [the] story [with] [the] number [of] murders [in] [dallas] ? 
A|71| A: [but i] _, you know _,_ _we_ _have_ _been_ _really_ fortunate_ our family , hasn't [had] _any_ [crime] . 
B|72| M: _it's not [that_ [i] don't] [have any] pride [in] my country [, i just] [don't know how] [to] [feel about it .] 
A|73| A: [and] _, so_ _we don't_ [, it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor _people that_ [have] suffered [that] way . 
B|74| M: i'm [not] _sure_ _, but [i_ know] [we _have] [,_ so] we've [been [really] ,] [really fortunate] . 
A|75| A: [and] [how] [they] _would_ expect , [how] [they] _would_ hope , 
B|76| M: [they] wouldn't , they'd _have [,_ you [know ,] the] best [of] intentions . 
A|77| A: _i mean_ [you] [, you] hear _of people_ who [have ,] um , committed crimes [, and] then [they] [get] out [of] jail [and] [they] _go_ [, and] [they] [do] [the] same thing again . 
B|78| M: [because] [the] world [is] full [of people that] [don't know how] _to do_ [that .] 
A|79| A: [and] [you] wonder [why] [they] [can't] [just] [stop] [it .] 
B|80| M: [they] _have a_ law [to] prevent [it] [from] happening . 
A|81| A: [so] , maybe _you would_ , 
B|82| M: [i] wouldn't 
A|83| A: [but] [still] _i would_ [hate to be] on [the jury] [that] sentenced someone . 
B|84| M: i'm [not] [a] judge 
A|85| A: [no , [i] know] when , um _, we_ _just _,_ we_ moved here [, uh [,] i] [from] [the] [, i] got [a] summons , [jury] summons , 
B|86| M: _what_ [do you] [mean [,] [we] [don't] know] ? 
A|87| A: [just] [like] constantly , [it] seemed _like ,_ 
B|88| M: [it] [was] [like ,] [a lot of] times [, uh ,] times . 
A|89| A: [but] fortunately [i] [had] small children [and] [i] _didn't_ [have] [to] _go_ . 
B|90| M: uhh , [yes [,] uh] 
A|91| A: [and [it's not] that] [, _i] mean [,_ [i] think] everyone should [have] [to] serve on _the jury ,_ 
B|92| M: [well] [yeah [.] [i] mean [,] it's] [pretty] much [a] [right .] 
A|93| A: _it's just_ [that] [, i] _didn't_ [, [i] hate] having [to be] _in charge_ [of] someone else's life . 
B|94| M: [i don't] understand [why] [you] [didn't] [go [to] [the] jury [,] if] [you] did [you would] [have been] [in charge] . 
A|95| A: [and] _i would_ [hate to] [have] [to] hear [any] kind [of] case , involving [a] violent [crime] or anything . 
B|96| M: [i [know] .] [it's [just] [, i] don't] [really] [know] _what_ [the other] guy [was] thinking . 
A|97| A: [that] _would be_ [really] awful . 
B|98| M: [i [would] be] [so] mad . 
A|99| A: [well ,] anyway [, i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [, uh ,] talking [to] [you] [about] this . although [it] has [been] difficult [but [,] uh] . 
B|100| M: [i've] [been] [to] [a] few [of] them [, they] [are] [pretty] _good_ . 
A|101| A: i'd [hate to] [decide] [it , but i] guess [, uh ,] guess [it's] important , [that] [we] [decide] as [a] [people] [what] , [what] we're [going [to] do] . 
B|102| M: [what] [is it] ? 
A|103| A: anyway , [well [,] you] [have a] [good] day . 
B|104| M: [a little] . 
A|105| A: thank [you] , bye-bye .
