B|2| M: _that's_ _a_ _very_ interesting idea . 
A|3| A: uh-huh . um . _well_ . 
B|4| M: _but_ _but_ _but_ ... 
A|5| A: _yes_ _i _know_ the_ one thing _that [i_ think] _is_ _really_ _sad_ _about it_ as [i] recall _from_ [the] articles _that_ _i've_ read _is_ _that_ _if_ _if_ _people_ who _have been_ _there_ _are going to be_ killed . um there's _people that_ come _to the_ prisons _and_ they're [very] violent _and_ _they_ want _i mean_ they're anxious _for_ someone _to be_ killed 
B|6| M: _what_ ? 
A|7| A: _i _just_ [i_ can't] see _that ._ 
B|8| M: _so_ _what_ [you] 
A|9| A: uh-huh . 
B|10| M: hehuh . 
A|11| A: _no ._ 
B|12| M: _what_ _do you_ [mean] ? 
A|13| A: _well_ _there_ _is_ [so] many chances _for_ _appeal_ _that_ [it] 
B|14| M: _i don't_ [think] [there] 
A|15| A: _it's_ _really_ _sad ._ 
B|16| M: _but_ _does_ [it's] [sad .] 
A|17| A: _i don't know_ _i just_ [think] um somehow [i] hoped _that_ as [a] _people_ _we_ could _be_ _better_ _than_ _than_ um expecting [the] feeling _that_ [it] 
B|18| M: _why_ ? _it's a_ [very] _good_ movie _it's a_ great movie _and it's not_ _like it's_ [going to] _get_ [better] . 
A|19| A: _with_ someone _is_ calling _for_ someone else _to be_ killed _you _know_ _._ is_ _really_ kind [of] bad 
B|20| M: [i] am . 
A|21| A: [and] [there] _really_ _are_ criminals _that_ _are_ hard-core [and] repeat [and] never _have any_ chance _for_ 
B|22| M: [no .] 
A|23| A: _oh_ _i don't know_ _is it_ [do you] _feel_ at all [like [it's] a] religious issue ? 
B|24| M: _how_ [is it] [really] ? 
A|25| A: uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [well] _that's_ [the] only reason [i've] ever _had_ [to] use _it ._ 
A|27| A: um . 
B|28| M: [oh] [is it] ? 
A|29| A: _i don't know_ sometimes [i] _feel_ _i mean_ [i] [do] _go to_ church [and] things _. i _don't know_ how_ _i would_ _feel about it _._ but_ [like] [you] say _if_ [it] hit [you] personally closer at home _you would_ _feel_ _feel_ differently . 
B|30| M: _why_ ? [how] ? 
A|31| A: _do you think_ most states _have_ _that_ or ? 
B|32| M: i'm _not_ _sure_ [. i don't [know] .] 
A|33| A: _that_ _still_ [does] [it] [that's] _right ._ 
B|34| M: [you] 
A|35| A: uh-huh . 
B|36| M: [no] [it's a] felony . 
A|37| A: _have_ _that ._ [well] [and] [it] doesn't seem [like] [very] many _people_ _uh_ _are_ [really] _i mean_ there's _a lot _of_ people that_ _are_ on death row _. but_ there's [not] [very] many _people that_ actually um . [do] [get] killed . 
B|38| M: i'm 
A|39| A: uh-huh . [so] [it] seems _like a_ _of people_ live [there] [and] then through appeals . 
B|40| M: [yes] [of] [have] 
A|41| A: _because_ _i know_ _they_ [do] frequently _i mean_ _they_ cover cover [it] _pretty_ heavily on television _and the_ newspaper . 
B|42| M: _why_ ? 
A|43| A: _if_ [it] finally gets [to] _that_ point . 
B|44| M: [do you think] they'll ever _stop_ ? 
A|45| A: _yeah ._ 
B|46| M: [so] [the] [appeal] [is] [for] [a] while ? 
A|47| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . [so] [is it] _uh_ _are_ _we_ doing lethal injection _now_ ? 
B|48| M: [and _the] jury_ _will_ _decide_ [that .] 
A|49| A: uh-huh which seems [so] awful . 
B|50| M: [it's a] long story . 
A|51| A: [so] [it's _a] little_ _bit more_ humane [i] guess [it] [is] 
B|52| M: [yeah] [uh] [no .] 
A|53| A: [yes] _the other_ one _just_ seems [so] terrible . 
B|54| M: [well] [it's] [still] [a] [bit more] painful [than] [the other] . 
A|55| A: um . 
B|56| M: _no [i_ don't] [think] [so] 
A|57| A: [well] [do you think] [that] _we_ [do] [it] _because we_ want [it] [to] deter _crime_ or [it's not] _because _we_ don't_ want [to] pay [for] inmates [to] stay _in_ prison ? 
B|58| M: [yes] [it's] [because we] [are] paying [for] them . 
A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [that's] _what_ [they] said [but] [it's] [because] [they] [don't] _have a_ problem 
A|61| A: um . 
B|62| M: _what_ [do you] [mean] ? 
A|63| A: _yes ._ 
B|64| M: [so] [are] [you] saying [that] [they] [are going to be] rehabilitated ? 
A|65| A: um . [well] um [and] [i] notice [that] _the crime_ rate [was] _up_ _in the_ _dallas_ _area_ [it's] [it's] kind [of] _been_ scary [to] [think] _about it_ 
B|66| M: [not] [in the] [area] i'm [in] . 
A|67| A: [and] [and] _you're_ hoping [there] [is] something [that] [will] cut _down_ on [that .] 
B|68| M: [yes [.] but] . [yes .] [it [.] is] . [up] . [to] . [now] . [if] [. but] [the crime] [is] [down] . 
A|69| A: [you] _hate to_ [have] [the] dubious honor [of] being _you know_ [so] high [in the] [in] statistics 
B|70| M: _i _hate_ to be_ [that] guy [but] what's [the] story [with] [the] number [of] murders [in] [dallas] ? 
A|71| A: [but i] _you _know_ we _have_ _been_ _really_ fortunate_ our family hasn't [had] _any_ [crime] . 
B|72| M: _it's not that [i_ don't] [have any] pride [in] my country [i just] [don't know how] [to] [feel about it .] 
A|73| A: [and] [so] _we don't_ [it's] harder [to] [think] [about] [the] poor _people that_ [have] suffered [that] way . 
B|74| M: i'm [not] _sure_ [but [i] [know] we have] [so] we've [been really] [really fortunate] . 
A|75| A: [and] [how] [they] _would_ expect [how] [they] _would_ hope 
B|76| M: [they] wouldn't they'd [have] [you [know] the] best [of] intentions . 
A|77| A: _i mean_ [you] [you] hear _of people_ who [have] um committed crimes [and] then [they] [get] out [of] jail [and] [they] _go_ [and] [they] [do] [the] same thing again . 
B|78| M: [because] [the] world [is] full [of people that] [don't know how] _to do_ [that .] 
A|79| A: [and] [you] wonder [why] [they] [can't] [just] [stop] [it .] 
B|80| M: [they] _have a_ law [to] prevent [it] [from] happening . 
A|81| A: [so] maybe _you would_ 
B|82| M: [i] wouldn't 
A|83| A: [but] [still] _i would_ [hate to be] on [the jury] [that] sentenced someone . 
B|84| M: i'm [not] [a] judge 
A|85| A: [no [i] know] when um [we] [just] [we] moved here [uh] [i] [from] [the] [i] got [a] summons [jury] summons 
B|86| M: _what_ [do you] [mean] [we [don't] know] ? 
A|87| A: [just] [like] constantly [it] seemed [like] 
B|88| M: [it] [was] [like [a] lot of] times [uh] times . 
A|89| A: [but] fortunately [i] [had] small children [and] [i] _didn't_ [have] [to] _go_ . 
B|90| M: uhh [yes] [uh] 
A|91| A: [and [it's not] that _i] mean_ [i think] everyone should [have] [to] serve on [the jury] 
B|92| M: [well] [yeah [.] [i] mean] [it's] [pretty] much [a] [right .] 
A|93| A: _it's just_ [that i] _didn't_ [i hate] having [to be] _in charge_ [of] someone else's life . 
B|94| M: [i don't] understand [why] [you] [didn't] [go [to] [the] jury] [if] [you] did [you would] [have been] [in charge] . 
A|95| A: [and] _i would_ [hate to] [have] [to] hear [any] kind [of] case involving [a] violent [crime] or anything . 
B|96| M: [i [know] .] [it's [just] [i] don't] [really] [know] _what_ [the other] guy [was] thinking . 
A|97| A: [that] _would be_ [really] awful . 
B|98| M: [i [would] be] [so] mad . 
A|99| A: [well] anyway [i] [sure] [have] enjoyed [uh] talking [to] [you] [about] this . although [it] has [been] difficult [but] [uh] . 
B|100| M: [i've] [been] [to] [a] few [of] them [they] [are] [pretty] _good_ . 
A|101| A: i'd [hate to] [decide] [it but i] guess [uh] guess [it's] important [that] [we] [decide] as [a] [people] [what] [what] we're [going [to] do] . 
B|102| M: [what] [is it] ? 
A|103| A: anyway [well] [you] [have a] [good] day . 
B|104| M: [a little] . 
A|105| A: thank [you] bye-bye .
