B|12| M: _no_ [i'm not] .

B|22| M:  
A|23| A: [uh] _yeah_ exactly .

B|28| M:  
A|29| A: _yeah_ 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: 'cause they're farmers . these [are] all farmers coming over 
B|32| M:  
A|33| A: _and_ they're being put in [the] middle [of the] city 
B|34| M:  ... [why] ? 
A|35| A: [i] _mean_ they're nomadic farmers _you know_ they're people who farm _on the_ hillside _and_ then leave [the] hillside _to_ _another_ hillside _and_ farm _on_ _that_ hillside . 
B|36| M: [so] [like] ... [a] farmer's [life] ? 
A|37| A: these [are] people who've _never_ seen flat ground before _and_ people who've _never_ seen property rights before . _you know_ these people who've _never_ seen any machines other than those used in war . _and_ [uh] _they_ have _you know ._ [so] [i] [i] [i] _do_ have [a] lot [of] sympathy for them _and_ [i] feel _that_ america could try [a] little bit harder _to_ _to_ help people adjusting _to the_ american _way ._ because if _they_ _don't_ _you're_ _just_ going _to_ produce _you know_ _you're_ going _to_ produce an underclass _you know ._ _you're_ going _to_ get [a] situation _that_ [i think] [a] lot [like] _what_ happened _to the_ blacks being sort [of] led out [of] slavery _and_ then then many [of] them ended up _just_ working [the] same jobs _they_ were as slaves then . _and_ there was [no] real up upward movement . 
B|38| M:  
A|39| A: _and_ [not] being _you know_ 
B|40| M:  
A|41| A: _um_ 
B|42| M:  
A|43| A: _well_ 
B|44| M: _oh you_ did . 
A|45| A: [i] [i] wasn't helping them . [i] worked with them [not] _to_ help them _but_ for _my_ own purposes . [i'm] [i'm] [a] linguist _and_ [i] was [uh] doing _a language_ trying _to_ _learn_ their _language_ [a] little bit . _and_ [i] actually _um_ [i] _mean_ helped them them in [the] sense _that_ _they_ received money for working with me _. but i_ didn't [i] didn't [i] wasn't [a] social worker or anything [like] _that ._ 
B|46| M: [i] 
A|47| A: [i] _do_ have friends who have tried _to_ _do_ _more_ social work _you know_ by explaining _to_ people _how_ [the] _language_ _and_ _what_ [the] problems learning _english_ might be _and_ such . 
B|48| M: [you] [i'm] 
A|49| A: because all [the] models [of] teaching _english_ [are] based _on_ teaching _english_ _to_ _spanish_ speakers or _to_ other european _language_ speakers . _and_ people _don't_ realize _how_ different some [of the] languages _they_ speak [are] . 
B|50| M: [english] ? 
A|51| A: [oh you] [are] ? 
B|52| M: [english] [is] [my] second [language] . 
A|53| A: uh-huh _well you_ 
B|54| M: [i] am [not] . 
A|55| A: _that's_ _that's_ _been_ [my] impression . 
B|56| M: [no] [they] teach [you] [how] [to] go [on] [and] [on] [and] [learn] [another] [way .] 
A|57| A: _yeah_ . [it's] _it's not_ they're [not] withholding information 
B|58| M: [it's] ... [it's] ... 
A|59| A: [they] _just_ _don't_ have _that_ information . 
B|60| M: [it's not] [a] step [it's a] step 
A|61| A: [they] [they] haven't [the] foggiest idea . 
B|62| M: [they] should [just] release [it] [on the] 14th . 
A|63| A: yes . 
B|64| M: [so] [you're] [saying] _you don't_ [like] [it] ? 
A|65| A: [and] _spanish is_ pretty close [to] [english] really . 
B|66| M: _spanish is a_ dialect [of] [english] [not] [a language] . 
A|67| A: [and] [spanish is a] lot [like] [english] . 
B|68| M: [it is] . 
A|69| A: _yeah_ . 
B|70| M: [do] [you [know] [that] the] word'i'is'a'word ? 
A|71| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ . _yeah_ . 
B|72| M: [i know that] [but [i] don't] [like] [it .] 
A|73| A: uh-huh uh-huh . uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|74| M: uhh [um] [uh] ... [i] [like] [it .] 
A|75| A: uh-huh . 
B|76| M: uuhh uuhh . 
A|77| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|78| M: uhuh . uhuh . 
A|79| A: [oh] [i'm] _sure_ [it] _would_ . 
B|80| M: maybe [. but i] wouldn't say [that .] 
A|81| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|82| M: uhhh ... [yeah] [that's] [not] [how] [it] works . 
A|83| A: [yeah] [it] _would_ be [a] good experience [and] you'd be helping people [i'm] _sure_ . _very_ much . [and] [and] [i] _mean_ [not] [to] put [not] [to] trivialize [the] problems [of] any immigrant group [but i] [do] [know] [the] asian groups [are] having [a] lot [of] trouble . [i] _mean_ [and] part [of the] problem [is] [that] [a] lot [of] chinese [and] japanese immigration from [you know] decades ago has _been_ _very_ successful because [they] valued education [and] [so] forth . 
B|84| M: [no] . 
A|85| A: [they] became [a] _very_ successful immigrant group [. but] [and] [but] [a] lot [of] people coming over from vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries [are] [are] [not] having [the] same success . [i think] some people have [just] assumed _well_ [why] [why] [can't] [you] be successful ? [the] japanese were or [the] chinese were or something . [and] [it's] really much _more_ complicated . 
B|86| M:  . 
A|87| A: [yeah] [the] times [are] different [yeah] . 
B|88| M:  . 
A|89| A: uh-huh . uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [no] [not] family 
A|91| A: uh-huh . 
B|92| M: [i don't] [think] [you] [understand] [the] point [of] [this] post . 
A|93| A: [oh] [yeah] . [i] [i think] [it's a] wonderful _thing_ [to] [do] . [and] there's [a] lot there's [a] lot _more_ [i] guess [another] possible solution [is] since taxpayers aren't going [to] start paying _more_ money for [this] [and] [and] other budgets aren't going [to] be cut [to] pay for [it] [uh] _more_ [of the] volunteer network service . 
B|94| M: uuh 
A|95| A: because everyone gains from [it .] 
B|96| M: [why] [would] anyone donate [to] [a] charity ? 
A|97| A: [would] be [would] might be really useful _. uh_ [and] if [it's] [you know] [uh] [just] people helping people [i think] makes makes [the] community [so] much happier . 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: uh-huh . yes . 
B|100| M: uhhhhhh [. uh] [. uh] 
A|101| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|102| M: [well] [the] [more] [you know .] 
A|103| A: yes yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in [this] [country .] [i] _mean_ [and] they're highly educated people [but] [of] course if [you're] educated [and] [you don't] speak [english] [no] one thinks anything [of] [you] . 
B|104| M: [you] [mean] you've [never] [been] [to the] us ? 
A|105| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [i'm not sure] [you] [understand] [how] [that] works . 
A|107| A: [yeah] [i] [do] too . [well] [it's] [been] good talking with [you] . 
B|108| M:  ... [i [don't] know what] [to] say . 
A|109| A: [uh] okay . 
B|110| M: [oh] [uh] [well [you] know] [that's] [not] [a] bad [thing] . 
A|111| A: okay [it] does sound [like] [you] have some children [to] take care [of] 
B|112| M: she nods [and] she's [very] nice . 
A|113| A: [uh] okay bye-bye .
