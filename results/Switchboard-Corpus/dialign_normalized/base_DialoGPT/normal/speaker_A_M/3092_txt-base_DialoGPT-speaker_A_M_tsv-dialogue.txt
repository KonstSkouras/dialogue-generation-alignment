A|63| A: [it] depends _on_ _who_ examines [your] eyes . 
B|64| M: [how] [would] [it] [work] ? 
A|65| A: [if [you] have] _an_ , _an_ optometrist _or_ _an_ ophthalmologist , there's [a] vast _difference_ [in] [those] two [, uh ,] professionals . 
B|66| M: [i'm] [not] [sure] [if] [i'm] [a] little bit biased [or] _not [,_ but] [i] don't [see] [any] [difference] . 
A|67| A: glaucoma . 
B|68| M: [what is] glaucomas ? 
A|69| A: oh . oh , okay , _so ,_

B|78| M: [yeah] [, [she] is] . [she is] [a] doctor . 
A|79| A: yes [, and] [, _you] know ,_ we [have] [, uh ,] needs [in] our life [that] [are] unique [to] [us] [and] [, uh [,] _you] know ,_ people [have] needs [in] their life [that] unique [to] [us] , [to] them . 
B|80| M: [you know , uh [,] that's] pretty good . 
A|81| A: [i mean ,] we [are] all different _so ,_

B|86| M: [she's] [still] here [, i'm] [just] [not] [sure] [if] [she's] [a] good person [or] [not] . 
A|87| A: _so ,_ [it's] okay . 
B|88| M: [what is] ? 
A|89| A: uh-huh . [that's] very expensive . 
B|90| M: [how much] [do you _think] [it_ is] ? 
A|91| A: yes [, _that's] true ._ orthodontic [work] [is] terribly expensive . 
B|92| M: [you] can _get_ [dental] [care] [at] [the] dentist [for] free . 
A|93| A: especially [when] [you [have] [a] lot] [of] problems [with the] children _teeth_ [, and] [, and] [you have] [to] really [get] them [when] [they are] young , [in] order [to] [have] [, uh ,] [not [,] uh ,] [a] decent smile [when] [they are] fifteen , sixteen years old . 
B|94| M: [that's true .] 
A|95| A: [i] [know ,] two [of] my daughters _had to_ [have] [that] [and] [they] started having extractions [at] age eight [, uh ,] because [they] [just] [had] too _many teeth_ [for] their size mouth . 
B|96| M: [you] [mean] [like] [a] regular tooth ? 
A|97| A: [and] we footed _the bill_ , because [there] was [not] [any] such thing [and] [when] [they] were young . 
B|98| M: [you] [had to] foot [the bill] [for _the] teeth_ 
A|99| A: oh , uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [it's] [not] [an] orthodon . [it's] [a] pallet . 
A|101| A: uh-huh , major . 
B|102| M: [you know ,] he's [a] big guy 
A|103| A: uh-huh . 
B|104| M: uhhh [, what] ? 
A|105| A: [well , i] tell [you] [i] [, [i] just] read [an] article [in the] paper [about] [what] [they are] doing [, i [think] it] was [an] ad [in] , [in] our publication [at] texas instruments , where [they are] breaking [the] jaw [and] [, and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with [the] teeth] . 
B|106| M: [how] [many teeth] [do [you] have] ? 
A|107| A: [it's] , [it's] less _painful_ [and] less expensive . 
B|108| M: [why] [is] [it so] [painful] ? 
A|109| A: [yeah] . 
B|110| M: [so ,] you're saying they're [not] ? 
A|111| A: [i] [, i] [know [,] but] [it ,] [it's] , [it's] [, uh ,] easier [on] [the] patient [in the] long run , which amazed me . 
B|112| M: aesthetic [is] [the] most [important] part [of] [a] treatment .
