A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| M: [why] [would you] [be] _in the_ [hospital] ? 
A|45| A: yes . _do you_ _do you think_ _that_ [you] should _fund_ _that [if_ they] [have] _that_ as [a] benefit [if you] [would] _fund_ _that_ somewhat from [your] salary _that_ _you are_ getting ? _do you think_ _that_ [would be] acceptable ? 
B|46| M: [are] [you] saying [that if] [i] _had_ [a] kid [i] [would] _go_ [to] [the] [hospital] ? 
A|47| A: [i] _do_ too .

A|61| A: _vision i_ guess [it's] called _vision_ [care .] 
B|62| M: [vision [i] think] [it's] [a] great idea . 
A|63| A: [it] depends _on_ _who_ examines [your] eyes . 
B|64| M: [how] [would it] [work] ? 
A|65| A: [if [you] have] _an_ _an_ optometrist _or_ _an_ ophthalmologist there's [a] vast _difference_ [in] [those] two [uh] professionals . 
B|66| M: [i'm] [not] [sure] [if] [i'm] [a] little bit biased [or] [not] [but] [i] don't [see] [any] [difference] . 
A|67| A: glaucoma . 
B|68| M: [what is] glaucomas ? 
A|69| A: oh . oh okay _so_ 
B|70| M: [i'm] [sure] [she] does [she] [has] [it]

B|74| M: [they are] ... [but] [are] [they] ? 
A|75| A: uh-huh . 
B|76| M: [and] [the] insurance [is] [on] [her] . 
A|77| A: right [that's] critical because _she's_ [in] need [of] _it so_ often . 
B|78| M: [yeah] [she is] . [she is] [a] doctor . 
A|79| A: yes [and] _you know_ we [have] [uh] needs [in] our life [that] [are] unique [to] [us] [and] [uh] _you know_ people [have] needs [in] their life [that] unique [to] [us] [to] them . 
B|80| M: [you know uh] [that's] pretty good . 
A|81| A: [i mean] we [are] all different _so_ 
B|82| M: [she's] [a] human . 
A|83| A: [well] [no] [that's] my _other phone ._ 
B|84| M: [and] ? [you are] [the] [one] [who] [is] talking [about] [the] [other phone .]

B|86| M: [she's] [still] here [i'm] [just] [not] [sure] [if] [she's] [a] good person [or] [not] . 
A|87| A: _so_ [it's] okay . 
B|88| M: [what is] ? 
A|89| A: uh-huh . [that's] very expensive . 
B|90| M: [how much] [do you _think] [it_ is] ? 
A|91| A: yes _that's true ._ orthodontic [work] [is] terribly expensive . 
B|92| M: [you] can _get_ [dental] [care] [at] [the] dentist [for] free . 
A|93| A: especially [when] [you [have] [a] lot] [of] problems [with the] children _teeth_ [and] [and] [you have] [to] really [get] them [when] [they are] young [in] order [to] [have] [uh] [not] [uh] [a] decent smile [when] [they are] fifteen sixteen years old . 
B|94| M: [that's true .] 
A|95| A: [i] [know] two [of] my daughters _had to_ [have] [that] [and] [they] started having extractions [at] age eight [uh] because [they] [just] [had] too _many teeth_ [for] their size mouth . 
B|96| M: [you] [mean] [like] [a] regular tooth ? 
A|97| A: [and] we footed _the bill_ because [there] was [not] [any] such thing [and] [when] [they] were young . 
B|98| M: [you] [had to] foot [the bill] [for _the] teeth_ 
A|99| A: oh uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [it's] [not] [an] orthodon . [it's] [a] pallet . 
A|101| A: uh-huh major . 
B|102| M: [you know] he's [a] big guy 
A|103| A: uh-huh . 
B|104| M: uhhh [what] ? 
A|105| A: [well i] tell [you] [i] [i just] read [an] article [in the] paper [about] [what] [they are] doing [i [think] it] was [an] ad [in] [in] our publication [at] texas instruments where [they are] breaking [the] jaw [and] [and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with [the] teeth] . 
B|106| M: [how] [many teeth] [do [you] have] ? 
A|107| A: [it's] [it's] less _painful_ [and] less expensive . 
B|108| M: [why] [is] [it so] [painful] ? 
A|109| A: [yeah] . 
B|110| M: [so] you're saying they're [not] ? 
A|111| A: [i] [i] [know] [but] [it] [it's] [it's] [uh] easier [on] [the] patient [in the] long run which amazed me . 
B|112| M: aesthetic [is] [the] most [important] part [of] [a] treatment .
