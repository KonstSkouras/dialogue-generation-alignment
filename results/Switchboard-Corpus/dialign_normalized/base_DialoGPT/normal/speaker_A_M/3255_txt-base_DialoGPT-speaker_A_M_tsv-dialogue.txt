A|27| A: minneapolis area , 
B|28| M: what's [the other thing] ? 
A|29| A: [uh ,] actually [no] . _we_ _have_ [, uh ,] quite [a] bit [, uh _,] [the_ only] _problem_ [that] _we_ _have_ _and_ [that's] all over [the] whole world [is] ozone _and_ _of_ course hay fever season 
B|30| M: what [is] _your_ [problem] ? 
A|31| A: [you] _get_ some pollutants such as those _, but_ those _are_ natural 
B|32| M: what [are] [we] _, a_ country ? 
A|33| A: [um _,] but_ [there] [is] starting [to] , [in] minneapolis itself , [because] _of_ _so_ _many people_ on [the] highway , [there] [is] becoming [a] [problem] _of_ _pollution_ _, and they_ [just] put [in] [a] strict law [that] as _of_ every year _when_ [you] _get_ [your] license tabs [you] _have to_ _have_ [your] _car_ inspected [to] see [if] [it's] releasing any [, uh ,] lead into _the air_ _or_ [other] pollutants , 
B|34| M:

B|38| M: [i don't] [think] _i'm_ gonna [be] able [to] drive [home] _for_ [the] rest [of the] night . 
A|39| A: _sure_ , _yeah ,_ 
B|40| M: [you're] saying you'd [be] ok [with] [that] ? 
A|41| A: _yeah [,_ it's _not] a_ [bad] _idea_ . uh-huh . _sure_ , _sure_ , 
B|42| M: [that's] [a] pretty good [idea] [, i think] [i] might [do] _it_ . 
A|43| A: exactly , 
B|44| M: well [, [the] car] _was_ designed _for_ [air] [pollution] [so] , [no] [, it's] _probably_ [not a] good design . 
A|45| A: uh-huh . _sure_ . uh-huh . 
B|46| M: [yeah [,] and they] [are] making [the] stuff [in] [the air] . 
A|47| A: uh-huh . 
B|48| M: [i] can't _even_ . 
A|49| A: _sure_ . 
B|50| M: uhh _, they_ _can_ [just] use [a] certain type [that] [they] [have] [a] lot [of] money [to] buy . 
A|51| A: uh-huh . _sure_ . 
B|52| M: [you] _can_ [get] [a] free _unit_ [of] freons _for_ [a] dollar . 
A|53| A: uh-huh . [yeah] . _sure_ 
B|54| M: _and [,_ uh ,] _if you_ 
A|55| A: [uh [,] [the] other thing] _when_ [you're] [talking] about _freon_ [with] cars [, uh ,] [air] conditioning [, i'm] _sure_ over [there] _it's a_ necessity versus something up here [we] [can] live without [it] 
B|56| M: uhh , [no] [, it's not] . 
A|57| A: _but it's_ uncomfortable 
B|58| M: uhhuhuhuh . [i don't know] . 
A|59| A: _but_ [, uh ,] this year my husband recharged our _freon_ [because] _it was_ , needed [to be] done [, and] [one] [of the] cans released entire amount [of] _freon_ into [the] [, uh ,] into [the air] [because] he opened [it] , 
B|60| M: [i'm] pretty [sure] [that's the case] . 
A|61| A: [and [,] [i] don't know] [if] [there] [was] something wrong [with] [it] , _or_ [it] , his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto [that ,] 
B|62| M: [it's] [okay .] 
A|63| A: [and] [i was] thinking _how many_ [other] [people] 
B|64| M: uhh , [how [many] people] [have] [you] had [to] work [with] ? 
A|65| A: [oh ,] [sure] , [because] [if you] take [it] into [a] service station [, they] want [to] charge [you] forty _dollars_ [just] [for] [, uh ,] _freon_ , which [only] costs [you] about _three_ _dollars_ 
B|66| M: [it was] [the] first [thing] _i thought_ [of] . 
A|67| A: _so i have_ this _feeling that_ _freon_ [probably] _will increase_ [in] _price_ [because] [it] [is] something [that] [people] _will_ _have to_ take into consideration [and] [say] , hey , [that's] [that's] right [there] . 
B|68| M: [so i have] [that] [feeling that] [the] [freon] [price] [will increase] ... 
A|69| A: [i think it's] like _three or_ four _dollars_ [a] [, a] [can] 
B|70| M: i'll [have to] check [when] [i] [get] [home [,] but] [i think] it'll [be] around [three or] [five] [dollars] . 
A|71| A: [and] [it] takes about four [to] [five] cans [to] fill up [a] [air] conditioning [unit] [in] [a] [car] [, and] [i] [, [i] thought] about [that [,] and] my husband [even] [was] kind [of] woozy after [that] [because] [i'm] [sure] he breathed [it] 
B|72| M: [that's the] joke . 
A|73| A: [but] [, uh ,] [you think] about [that ,] all [the] [people] [that] [are] using [freon] [and] things like [that] 
B|74| M: [but [it's] not] an airplane [, [it's] a] fuel tanker .
