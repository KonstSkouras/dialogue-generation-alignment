B|0| M: _i_ _do_ believe . 
A|1| A: well there _are_ _a_ lot _of_ things _that_ _people_ [i] think general 
B|2| M:  ... 
A|3| A: well [i] think _it's_ _interesting_ _to_ look at uh where _the_ money goes and it goes _a_ lot _of_ places where it probably ought _not_ go and and [i] don't think generally [i] think what's _interesting_ _is that_ _we_ probably represent _the_ majority _of_ _people_ in _this_ country in terms _of_ their feelings _about _the_ government_ 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: and _how_ it serves us given _the_ extraordinarily large sum _of_ money _the government_ has _to_ operate with . 
B|6| M: _the people_ _have_ [a] _right_ _to be_ _free_ _from_ oppression . 
A|7| A: and _that_ _what_ [i] think _is_ going [to be] really _interesting_ _is_ _what_ _we_ [do] _about_ it . [i] mean _we_ _are_ going [to] [have] [to] change [the people] who represent us . 
B|8| M: [we] . 
A|9| A: [i] mean and [i] think _it's_ going [to be] real _interesting_ [to] see and and then force upon them uh 
B|10| M: i'm _just_ saying _that's not_ [how] [the] system works . 
A|11| A: _yeah_ [right] [that's] [i] think [that's] [the] only _thing_ [that's] going [to] change it . 
B|12| M: _it's _a_ _very_ interesting_ [thing] . 
A|13| A: our anger _is_ going [to] [have] [to] [to] give rise [to] [to] more activity on our part . 
B|14| M: _this _is_ a_ shame . 
A|15| A: uh i've i've said for years _that_ there's full employment for [the] politically active and in our society uh there's [very] little full employment . most [people] in [this] country _are_ getting worse off [not] better off . 
B|16| M: [it's] [not] [about the] economy . [it's] [about the] economic situation . 
A|17| A: eighty percent _of the_ public according [to] bill moyers' uh recent uh piece for uh public broadcasting which by [the] way [is [a] very] good use _of_ _government_ money . [i] think p b s [is] wonderful . _but_ [this] special focused on [the] fact _that_ eighty percent _of [the_ people] in [this] country _are_ _are_ seeing their real incomes and thus standards _of_ living decline . and twenty percent _are_ seeing theirs improve . [that's not] [a] formula for [a] better society . 
B|18| M: [i] 
A|19| A: and _the government_ really plays [a] role in [this] . 
B|20| M: _you_ . 
A|21| A: [i] mean well _they are_ [the people] whose strings _are_ pulled and by [i] guess powerful 
B|22| M: [what] [are] [they are] ... 
A|23| A: [you] know and [it's] really [interesting] [to] see [how] _that_ affects [people] because essentially more and more [people] in [this] country [are] [not] likely [to] revolt in [the] way _that_ [people] used [to] think _of_ _of the_ voter revolting . _but_ [people] [are] pretty much getting [the] picture _that_ some [people] get taken care _of_ and others don't and [they] think [it's] unfair and when [they] recognize _that_ [it's] their tax money they're going [to] [do] more [about] it . [i] i'll tell [you] one quick uh one [thing] [very interesting] . c b s after [the] state _of the_ union address [is] going [to] open up [a] telephone line an eight hundred number and [people] _can_ call in and say [what] [they] think [about] what's going on in [this] country . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| A: [they] expect opening it for one hour _that_ they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls . 
B|26| M:  ... 
A|27| A: and i've thought for years it would make [a] lot _of_ sense [to] create an eight hundred number for voters [to] call and and vent their frustration with _government_ . _like_ one eight hundred capitol or something _like_ _that ._ [you] know [just] [a] number [you] could call [from] anywhere anytime . 
B|28| M: yes . 
A|29| A: [i] think [that's] coming and [i] think once once [people] really start [to] communicate [how] [they] feel things [are] going [to] change . until then [i] think [you] know [it's] going [to be] really painful . so [the] question [is] [how] soon [are] [we] going [to] start [to] get our money's worth and as [you] said [it's] [how] soon [we] get involved and [i] think [we] need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to] get involved _like_ allowing us [to] call [a] toll [free] number and say hey look [do] it [this] way [not] _that_ way or [i] _like_ [this] or [i] don't _like_ _that_ or [this is] [how] [i] feel [about] your spending my money on art _that_ [i] don't think [is] art . 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: well [that's] [the] good [thing] [about] [what] [is] happening because [i] think more and more [the] news media which takes [a] heck _of a_ beating and and deserves some _of_ it [is] telling us [you] know [about the] problems . so [the] more [we] communicate hey look [we] want [a] change here because [you] know as it turns out we've wasted [a] tremendous amount _of_ money on our defense spending in [this] country . 
B|32| M: [like] . lol 
A|33| A: over [a very] long period _of_ time . 
B|34| M:  
A|35| A: uh and uh 
B|36| M: [yeah] [but] [the government] [can] [do] [that .] 
A|37| A: [right] . 
B|38| M: [yeah] [the] whole point [of the] movie [is that] [the] entire [thing] [is a] bit [of a] mess . 
A|39| A: [yeah] . well [you] may [be] [right] . [what] [i] think [is] really going [to be] [interesting] [is] [to] see [how] uh [we] as [a] society deal with it and [i] and [i] think it [is] [what] [you] say [it's] [it's a]
