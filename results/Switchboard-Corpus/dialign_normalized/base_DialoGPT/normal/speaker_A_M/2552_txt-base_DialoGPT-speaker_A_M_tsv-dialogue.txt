A|61| A: _well ,_ _that's_ _right ._ [but] [i] [do] [think] , um , [you] [know ,] _like_ [the] current trends [are] [that] , um , _the family_ unit is devaluated . _it's not_ nearly [as] important . 
B|62| M: [you] . 
A|63| A: [we] find [that] , [you] [know ,] _back_ [just] even fifty years ago when people [had] financial problems , [the] first place [they] went [to] was their _family_ . 
B|64| M: [i think] . 
A|65| A: [and] _families_ took care [of] themselves _and ,_ um [, but] now , [you] [know ,] people _don't ,_ [they] [don't] support each other [that] way .

A|71| A: [right] _, right_ , 
B|72| M: [i] [don't [,] but] i'm [right .] 
A|73| A: [and] _it's not_ an easy sacrifice for [a] person [to] make , because , [you] [know [,] [i] ,] [you] [know [,] i have] interests [that] , too , 
B|74| M: i'm [not [,] but] i'm [the] [one] who's asking . 
A|75| A: [and] _it_ is hard [to] make [, uh ,] those interests [not] [be] [as] [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|76| M: [no [,] [right] .] 
A|77| A: uh-huh . 
B|78| M: [oh] . [right .] 
A|79| A: uh-huh . 
B|80| M: _yeah [,_ uh] . 
A|81| A: [right .] 
B|82| M: [i think] . 
A|83| A: _it_ is _temporary ._ _it_ , _in the_ middle [of] _it_ , _it_ seems _like_ _a long_ [time] , 
B|84| M: [it's] 
A|85| A: [but] you're [right] , _it_ is _temporary ._ _well [,_ i] see [that] [we] both share _the same_ belief here _that it's_ important [that] [we] spend [time] [with] our [kids] 
B|86| M: _that's true_ [, but it's] still [temporary .] 
A|87| A: [and , [and] ,] _in_ spite [of] , 
B|88| M: [they are] [in [the] same] house . 
A|89| A: uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [well , it's] [a long] shot [, but it's] always [the] best idea . 
A|91| A: [yes .] 
B|92| M: [do] [they] [have] any children ? 
A|93| A: [that's true] . 
B|94| M: _i've_ never heard [of] [a] single [girl] having [a] son [or] daughter . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . 
B|96| M: [i] [know] i'm [just not] sure [about] 
A|97| A: [yeah] . 
B|98| M: [he ,] [just] [, with] . 
A|99| A: [well ,] _it_ is , [the] hardest thing [i've] [ever] done , [as] much [as] you'd [go] out 
B|100| M: [oh] [i] [know ,] i'm [just] saying [that [it's] not as] bad [as] [i] [thought] [it] [would] [be] . 
A|101| A: [and ,] 
B|102| M: i'm sorry [, but] ... 
A|103| A: uh-huh . 
B|104| M: _yeah ,_ [my] wife [, uh ,] likes [that] .

A|109| A: uh-huh . 
B|110| M: [oh [,] uh ,] what's [the] deal [with] [that] ? 
A|111| A: [no] . [yeah [,] [i] think] [so] . [i think] [it's] an investment [in] [your] future , even if [it's] purely [not ,] [not] religious . [you] [can] at least say [that it's] important [to] our country , [that] our [family] unit stays strong .
