B|36| M: [i think] they're [just [not] as] funny [as] [they] used [to] [be] . 
A|37| A: _well it's_ also important [i think] um for [my] husband . [i] [i] try _to go_ out [of] [my] way [to] [to] plan things [that] _he_ [can do] _with_ [the] [kids] because since [i] am home _with_ them _and_ [so] [i] get [a lot of] [time] _with_ them _he_ needs [to] [have] um some [time] _with_ them . 
B|38| M: [yes .]

B|44| M: [i] _don't_ [know] [but] [he spends] hours reading 
A|45| A: [and] um _but it's_ hard for him on saturdays . _he he wants_ _right_ _he wants to_ run out [and] get things done 
B|46| M: [he] has [to] [be] [he's] [a lot of] fun [to] watch . 
A|47| A: [and] [so] um [i] try [to] say [well] why [don't] [you] _go fly_ kites _or_ why [don't] [you] _do something ._ 
B|48| M: [i] [uh] [don't] [think] [he's] gonna [he's] [uh] ... [not] [a] guy . 
A|49| A: [and] if [i have] _something_ _in_ mind _then he he_ remembers [that] _that's_ [what] _he wants to_ [do] . 
B|50| M:  ... [and [then] [he [he] wants] [to] [go] fly] [and] [do something .] 
A|51| A: uh-huh .

A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [and we] did [they] [have] [kids] ? 
A|61| A: [well] _that's_ _right ._ [but] [i] [do] [think] um [you] [know] _like_ [the] current trends [are] [that] um _the family_ unit is devaluated . _it's not_ nearly [as] important . 
B|62| M: [you] . 
A|63| A: [we] find [that] [you] [know] _back_ [just] even fifty years ago when people [had] financial problems [the] first place [they] went [to] was their _family_ . 
B|64| M: [i think] . 
A|65| A: [and] _families_ took care [of] themselves [and] um [but] now [you] [know] people [don't] [they] [don't] support each other [that] way . 
B|66| M: [the family] [family] [families] . 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| M: [i] [know] [right] ? 
A|69| A: _that's_ [right] [and] 
B|70| M: [that _and] and_ 
A|71| A: [right] [right] 
B|72| M: [i] [don't] [but] i'm [right .] 
A|73| A: [and] _it's not_ an easy sacrifice for [a] person [to] make because [you] [know] [i] [you] [know] [i have] interests [that] too 
B|74| M: i'm [not] [but] i'm [the] [one] who's asking . 
A|75| A: [and] _it_ is hard [to] make [uh] those interests [not] [be] [as] [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|76| M: [no] [right .] 
A|77| A: uh-huh . 
B|78| M: [oh] . [right .] 
A|79| A: uh-huh . 
B|80| M: [yeah] [uh] . 
A|81| A: [right .] 
B|82| M: [i think] . 
A|83| A: _it_ is _temporary ._ _it_ _in the_ middle [of] _it_ _it_ seems _like_ _a long_ [time] 
B|84| M: [it's] 
A|85| A: [but] you're [right] _it_ is _temporary ._ [well] [i] see [that] [we] both share _the same_ belief here _that it's_ important [that] [we] spend [time] [with] our [kids] 
B|86| M: _that's true_ [but it's] still [temporary .] 
A|87| A: [and and] _in_ spite [of] 
B|88| M: [they are] [in [the] same] house . 
A|89| A: uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [well it's] [a long] shot [but it's] always [the] best idea . 
A|91| A: [yes .] 
B|92| M: [do] [they] [have] any children ? 
A|93| A: [that's true] . 
B|94| M: _i've_ never heard [of] [a] single [girl] having [a] son [or] daughter . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . 
B|96| M: [i] [know] i'm [just not] sure [about] 
A|97| A: [yeah] . 
B|98| M: [he] [just] [with] . 
A|99| A: [well] _it_ is [the] hardest thing [i've] [ever] done [as] much [as] you'd [go] out 
B|100| M: [oh] [i] [know] i'm [just] saying [that [it's] not as] bad [as] [i] [thought] [it] [would] [be] . 
A|101| A: [and] 
B|102| M: i'm sorry [but] ... 
A|103| A: uh-huh . 
B|104| M: [yeah] [my] wife [uh] likes [that] . 
A|105| A: uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [uh] she works [in the] bathroom . 
A|107| A: [well] [that's] good . 
B|108| M: i'm [not] going [to] lie . she's [not] going [back] [to] work . 
A|109| A: uh-huh . 
B|110| M: [oh] [uh] what's [the] deal [with] [that] ? 
A|111| A: [no] . [yeah] [i think] [so] . [i think] [it's] an investment [in] [your] future even if [it's] purely [not] [not] religious . [you] [can] at least say [that it's] important [to] our country [that] our [family] unit stays strong . 
B|112| M: [yes .]
