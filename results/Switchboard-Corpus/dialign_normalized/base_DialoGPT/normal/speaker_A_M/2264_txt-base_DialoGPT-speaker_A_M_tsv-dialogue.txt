[it's] [, [you know] ,] t [i] doesn't [give] them [any] money , all , everything [is] made from [that] . and [they] had talked about having [a] [thing] like , one saturday [a] month [, you] could come and drop _your_ aluminum cans off from home [, [you know] ,] 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: and [i'm] kind _of_ like , [yeah] . [i] shall , [they] would [do] [that] because at least somebody _was_ getting [the] money out _of_ [it] [, you know .] [that] _was_ [going to] use [it] for [good] , [so ,] 
B|46| M:
