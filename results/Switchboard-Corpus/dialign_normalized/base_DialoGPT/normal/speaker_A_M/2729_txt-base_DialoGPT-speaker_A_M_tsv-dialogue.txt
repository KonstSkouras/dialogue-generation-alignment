B|81| M: [did] [the puppy] jump [in [the] river] ? 
A|82| A: 'cause if _she_ fell [in] _then_ i'd _of_ [been] , [had] [to] [go] [in] after her [. and] up here [the] water's probably [about] forty degrees right now . 
B|83| M: [why] [is] [it] [so] _wet_ ? 
A|84| A: [and i] would [not] have [been] _fun_ trying [to] retrieve her _, but_ [, uh ,] [this [dog] ,] dennis jumped [in] [and] [got] [this] look on [his] face [like] [what] do [i] do now , as [he's] floating down [the river] _then_ finally discovered [that] [he] could swim [and] [, uh ,] actually paddled up against [the] current [and] [, uh ,] made [it] [back] [to] [the] shore [and] climbed up [and] _then_ , [he] , [he] jumped [in] again , [and] _he was_ swimming [for] quite [a] bit , all afternoon [. he] loved [it] .
