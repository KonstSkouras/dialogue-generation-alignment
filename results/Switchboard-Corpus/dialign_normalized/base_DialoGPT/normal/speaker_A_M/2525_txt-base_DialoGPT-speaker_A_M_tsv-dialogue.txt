A|63| A: uh-huh . _it_ [was] amazing [i] [went to] [the] far east [uh] back [in] october [to] do _some_ training for t [i] [and] [i] 
B|64| M: uhh _. [uh_ .] 
A|65| A: [uh] _some_ [of] those countries _were_ so _safe_ _it_ [was] unreal . singapore [is] [very] supposed [to be] [very] _safe_ [and] [in] fact tokyo [and] [i] thought tokyo would [be] dangerous [being] such [a] huge large city [with] so many _people_ 
B|66| M: ughuh 
A|67| A: [but] [they] [at] [at] [the] t [i] _there_ [i] said [is] _there_ any area [i] _should_ avoid [. and] [the] guy said let me ask [another] girl _here_ [and] [he] turned [and] asked [this] girl [and] said _can_ [you think] [of] any [place] [where] dana shouldn't go by herself or anything [. and] _she_ _she_ thought for _a few_ minutes [and] _she_ said [no [.] and] [he] said [is] _there_ any [place] [you] wouldn't go by yourself . _she_ said [no [.] and] [they] said _it_ [is] so _safe_ _there_ [that] [you] _can_ leave your purse [on] [the] subway 
B|68| M: [she] ? 
A|69| A: [and] somebody will turn _it_ [in] [and] [and] nothing will [be] missing [. they] said [they] _can_ [just] [about] guarantee [that] _there_ [that] [that] would happen [if] [you] did [that] . [i] thought boy [in] america [if] [you] left [a] purse [on] [a] subway [you] would never see _it_ again . 
B|70| M:  ... 
A|71| A: [yeah] [that's true] 
B|72| M: [i] 
A|73| A: [that's true] . [but [i] was] thinking boy [in] [dallas] [if] somebody asked me [if] _there_ _were_ _places_ [you] wouldn't go by yourself [at] night i'd [have] [to] set _them_ down for [about] five or ten minutes [to] list [all] [the] _places_ [out .] 
B|74| M: [it .] 
A|75| A: _i mean_ [i] couldn't believe [that] [she] couldn't [think] [of] any [place [.] they] said [the] apparently [the] crime [is] [just] [uh] 
B|76| M: [no] [they] [were] talking [about] [the] crimes . 
A|77| A: [i'm] [not] sure [what] [it] [is] _there ._ now [i] _know what_ [it] [is] [in] singapore [is] [they have] [the] death penalty [and] [they] really enforce [it] 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: [like] for drugs for drugs [they] [they] enforce [the] death penalty for [that] [. [uh] they're just] [very] [very] tough [and] [i] guess maybe [that's] [the way] tokyo [is] too or _japan_ [is] too _. [they're_ just] [very] tough [on] criminals . 
B|80| M: [japan] 
A|81| A: uh-huh . 
B|82| M: [no] [no] [no [.] they're] 
A|83| A: uh-huh .

B|90| M: [um] ... [i think] [we] [can] [get] [them] [out] [of] [here] . 
A|91| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|92| M: we're [not] [all] bad [but] [there] [are] [some] [people] who [deserve to] [get] [out] [of] jail . 
A|93| A: right _and if_ [they're] _overcrowded well_ [you know] [they] shouldn't [have] gotten theirself [there] [in] [the] first [place .] 
B|94| M: [and if] [they get] [overcrowded well] [they] [should] [have] been [put] away . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|96| M:  
A|97| A: uh-huh . 
B|98| M:  ... 
A|99| A: _oh_ [yeah] [i agree] [because] [it's] [not] _fair_ [to] those [of] us [that] [that] [deserve] _a safe_ [you know] life [to] [have] [to] 
B|100| M: [it's a] shame [that] you're [getting] downvoted . 
A|101| A: right . 
B|102| M: [no] [it's] [all] [fair] 
A|103| A: uh-huh .

A|113| A: right [not] much . 
B|114| M: [you] pay [them] . 
A|115| A: [yeah] huh-uh [and] especially [not] [in] [some] [of] these big cities [like] [in] [dallas] [i mean] they've [had] [they're] up [in] [the] top top five [i think] [of] cities [that] [are] [getting] policeman killed [on] [on] [in] [the] line [of] duty [and] [that's] really sad . 
B|116| M: [not] [all] [of] [them] . [there] [are] [a lot of] [places] [where] police [are] [not] [the] most effective . 
A|117| A: uh-huh . 
B|118| M: [a few] hundred dollars [a] day 
A|119| A: uh-huh . 
B|120| M: how [are] [they] ?
