A|31| A: [it] really [is] . 
B|32| M: [well [,] mine] [is] _still_ there . 
A|33| A: because [, _you] know ,_ _they_ [have a] lot [of] things [of] their own [, and] [i] [, _you] know _,_ i_ wouldn't mind having [, and] [i] at one _time_ _was_ _going to_ fix up when one [of] my daughters left , [a] bedroom _to_ where [i] _had_ [a] room _to_ _just_ [put] all [of] my craft stuff [and] sewing machine [and] all _that_ kind [of] stuff ,

A|43| A: uh-huh . _well , i_ [still] , all three [of] my daughters [are] married _, but_ _, [i don't_ [know] _,] _i_ just_ [still] [have] need _for_ [the] four bedrooms _just_ having company from _time to_ _time_ . [and] [some of] _them_ coming back home [and] things [, [you] [know] .] 
B|44| M: uhh ... _well , i _don't_ ._

B|58| M: [i just] [had] [to] [be] told . 
A|59| A: [well , i] [have] [the] three girls [and] then [we] ended up with four grandsons . 
B|60| M: [i'm] [sure] i'll [find] [someone] [to] date . 
A|61| A: [and] [little] boys [are] around _the house_ [a] [whole] lot more than girls . 
B|62| M: [he] nods [and] smiles [well , i] am [a] girl . 
A|63| A: [and] [, uh [,] i] enjoy _them_ coming [, but] [for] _short_ doses 
B|64| M: [i] love [them] [, but] [they] [are] too [short] [for] me 
A|65| A: [it] feels , after they've been here ten minutes , [they] [have] already explored [the] entire _house_ , [they] [know] everything . 
B|66| M: [that's] [a] long [time to] wait [for] [them] [to] explore [the house] . 
A|67| A: [but] , _they're_ fun .

B|72| M: [you] can [watch them] [, but] [they] [don't] [like] [it] . 
A|73| A: [i] [think] [that] once [you] [do that] , [your] children kind [of] develop [the] same attitudes . at least my daughters [have] . [they] try [to] teach theirs [not] [to] get [into] things instead [of] having [to] [put] everything up . [so] [it's] worked pretty [well] . there's [, i don't] really [think] anything's been broken . every now [and] then [we] [have] [to] kind [of] go [and] say , now [don't] bother this [you [know] .] 
B|74| M:  
A|75| A: [but] , all [in] all , [they] mind pretty [well] . [but] [, [i] guess] most [of the] [what] kind [of] roof does [your] [house] [have] ? here [i'm] getting off [the] subject .
