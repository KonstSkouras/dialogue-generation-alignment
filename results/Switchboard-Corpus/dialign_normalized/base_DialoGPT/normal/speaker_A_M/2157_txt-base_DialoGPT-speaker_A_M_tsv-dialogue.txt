B|14| M: _cowboys_ ? [the] only [team] _that was_ _ever really_ _in_ contention _for the_ nfc north ? 
A|15| A: [well ,] _he_ could always [get] past _, you_ [know ,] he'd [get] past _like_ six or seven tackles _and_ just keep spinning around _and_ [get] _on_ into [the] end zone . but , um [, i guess] _you_ never could [really] see him play , because _with_ [the cowboys] , while _he was_ _with_ [the team] , [the] rest _of [the_ team] [was] [pretty] poor [so] _you_ couldn't [really] tell [if] _it_ [was] just him or [the team] _and_ [i] always just assumed [that] _he was_ too [good] [for the] rest _of [the_ team] . but [, [i] don't know] .

A|21| A: [did] _he_ , [did] _he_ actually play _in the_ pro _bowl ._ _i remember_ _he was_ _like_ [a] backup _and then_ somebody _got_ injured _and_ _he was_ supposed _to_ _go ._ 
B|22| M: nah [he was a] rookie [last year .] 
A|23| A: _yeah , i_ kind [of] [, i] haven't _been_ keeping up _with_ football [, i] mean , _in the_ fall [i] [, i] [can] _go_ _on_ _and_ _on_ _about_ football , but _since_ _it's_ kind [of] off season , _it's_ kind [of] hard _to_ [think] back _about_ _all_ _that ._ but , uh , 
B|24| M: _not sure_ . 
A|25| A: _yeah_ . 
B|26| M: _this_ [is] ?

B|38| M: [the vikings] [and] [cowboys are] both [on the] downswing 
A|39| A: just hadn't heard much _about_ [them] lately . 
B|40| M: _oh [._ [well] [i] think] [i'm] _going to do_ [it] _anyway_ . 
A|41| A: _yeah_ [. [well] ,] [the] cardinals [, [i] don't know] . [i think the cowboys] probably _have a_ , [a] [better] [team] . [they] just , at [the] end [of the] season , [the] kind [of] [got] messed up [with] aikman getting hurt , because , uh , laufenberg just couldn't [ever really] [get] [it] together at [all] . [of] course , [he] sat along [the] sidelines [all] season , [he] never [really] [got] [in] [a] game , never [did] [a] whole lot . 
B|42| M: [i] 
A|43| A: [well ,] [i'm] just saying [i] shouldn't [, i] shouldn't blast him _like_ [that] , say , [oh] [well ,] laufenberg [got] [out] there [and] blew [it] [for] [them] [, i] mean , [he] didn't [get] [to] see much action . but , too bad . because now , now _, you_ [know ,] [he] had [a] shot [and] [, and] didn't look too [good] [and] [so] , _no_ one's [going to] [have] much faith [in] him [any] more . 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: [in] fact [, [i] think] they're getting [a] different guy [for] [a] backup quarterback . [i] haven't , uh [, i] haven't kept up [with] [it] lately , but _i remember_ reading something [a] few months ago _about_ [them] signing somebody else [on] , or , or trying [to] _go_ after somebody or trade [for] somebody , but [it] [wasn't] anybody i'd [really] heard [of] . but [i] heard [on the] radio [this] morning , or yesterday morning , [that] , uh , aikman's back [in] practicing , doing real , real [well] . um , who [is it] , michael irvin 
B|46| M: ' 
A|47| A: [he] said [that] , uh , aikman [was] hitting him [right] [on the] numbers every time . [so] , sounds _like_ he's [going to] [be] [all] [right] [for] next season . they're just trying [not] [to] overwork him [right] now , until [he] gets his shoulder , uh , back [in] [it] [was] his shoulder , [wasn't] [it] , [that] [he] had [the] problems [with] ? 
B|48| M: s 
A|49| A: [i think] [it] [, [i] think] [it] [was] his shoulder [he] had surgery [on] . but [anyway] , they're trying [to] keep him _, you_ [know ,] keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but [anyway] 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: _thirty_ day notice [for] [what ?] 
B|52| M: [thirty] days ? 
A|53| A: _oh ,_ [really] . 
B|54| M: [he was] told by [the] doctor [to] stop . 
A|55| A: [what] . _oh ,_ _okay_ , maybe [i'll] call [you] back after , after [the] recording [is] finished . actually [i think] [we] [have] talked _about_ football [for] five minutes . [i] _can't_ _remember_ . 
B|56| M: [well [,] you] [can't] [really] _talk _about_ that ._ 
A|57| A: [really] . _i usually_ [have] , too . 
B|58| M: [oh [,] [yeah] , [i] usually] _do ._ 
A|59| A: [yeah ,] i've done [that] once or twice . [i] didn't look at [the] clock _when_ [we] started talking , [so] [i guess] [we] should [talk about] football [a] little bit longer just [to] [be] [sure] [we got] five minutes [in] . 
B|60| M: [it's] [okay .] 
A|61| A: [yeah] . [so] other than [the vikings] , who [do] [you] _like_ ? 
B|62| M: [i] [like] . 
A|63| A: uh , [oh .] 
B|64| M: [no] [, i] _was the_ coach . 
A|65| A: [yeah] . 
B|66| M: _they [have_ a] history [of] letting [the] best _players_ [go .] 
A|67| A: uh-huh . back _when they_ were [in] saint louis ? 
B|68| M: [i remember] [when they] won [the] _super [bowl_ .] 
A|69| A: _since_ _they've been_ [to] phoenix [they] haven't _been_ , uh , [all] [that] impressive [, i guess] . [i guess] i've always _been_ [a] cowboy [fan .] other than [that] [, i] mean [, you] [know ,] [when] i've [, you] [know ,] [when] [you] grow up [in] [a] city [that] has [the] [, you] [know ,] one [of the] greatest football teams until [the] [last] few years [, you] kind [of] tend [to] [get] caught up [in] [it .] 
B|70| M:  
A|71| A: [yeah] . 
B|72| M: [they've been] [in the] nfl [since] [the] 70s 
A|73| A: [yeah , i] mean [it] , [it] [was] [really] exciting , growing up [when] , [when] [the cowboys] were [really] big . because my parents would always [have] season tickets [, and] they'd [go] [to] [all] [the] games [, and] [you] [know ,] [the] hype were just unbelievable . [it's] just [, you] [know ,] [the] [last] , [oh] [i guess] probably [since] [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when they] started kind [of] [going] downhill [really] , but [, you] [know ,] [i'm] just used [to] always growing up [and] hearing [cowboys] , [cowboys] , [cowboys] [, and] [, you] [know ,] [super bowl] [, and] [all] [this] other stuff . [so] [, i] [can't] [, you] [know ,] [i'm] [not] [going to] decide [i don't] [like] [them] just because they're having [a] few bad years . [i] mean [, [i] think] they'll pull [out of] [it] [, and] [, you] [know ,] they'll , they'll wind up being [good] again . [they've] [got] some , lot [of] [really] [good] young [players] [that] [are] [going to] , [that] [are] [going to] , uh , [do] [pretty good] [, [i] think] . but , they're raising prices [on] their tickets . [so] they're banking [on] doing [good] next season . [i think] tickets [are] , 
B|74| M: [oh ,] debor 
A|75| A: [yeah] . 
B|76| M:  ... 
A|77| A: [thirty] , or thirty-two [for] [really] [good] tickets . see , [they] , [they] sectioned [it] [out] [even] more . [they] used [to] just [have] [like] , uh , [first] [of] [all] [it] [was] [all] one price . [and then] [they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] end zone [and then] everything else . [and] now they're sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] , from one twenty yard line [to] [the] other one , just [on the] lower levels [is the] highest price [, and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] same area but above [it] [on the] upper level [, and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . [and then] they're some sections kind [of] [in the] corner areas [, and then] [the] cheapest [of] course [is] [going to] [be] [the] end , [the] direct end zones . but , um , [they have] [about] four or five different prices now , [that] they're structuring [it] [with] , but obviously [yeah ,] they're [all] [going] up , more or less [is] [what] [it's] [going to [do] .] 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: um [, you] [know ,] [i'm] [not sure] , [i'm] [not] positive [, i] didn't [, i] didn't [really] [think] [about that .] [i] just [remember] trying [to] figure [out] where [you] could [get] [that was] real close [to] [the] [good] section but [in the] little bit cheaper . but , [not] [that] [i'll] [ever] [go .] [i] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [cowboys] game , time , [last] time [i] went [to] [the cowboys] game [was] during [that] , um , n f l strike , or [the] , [when they] had [the] scab [team] , teams [in] there [, and] [it] [was the] , uh , dallas [and] washington redskins game . [and] [i] went because my dad [can] [usually] [get a] hold [of] some free tickets , because [a] lot [of] those doctors [have] season tickets [, and] [they] , um , [if] they're [not] [going to] use [them] they'll give [them] [to] somebody else . [so] my dad [, i] went [with] my dad [to] [a] game [that] one time . but [that wasn't] [a] real [, you] [know ,] [it] [was] , [it] [was the] scab teams , [it] [was] kind [of] [, you] [know ,] [it] [was] kind [of] different [, i guess] . [and] before [that] [it's] [been] quite [a] few years . i've [been] wanting [to] [go] [to] [a] game [, i] just never , never [have] gotten around [to] [it .] [so] maybe [this] [year .]
