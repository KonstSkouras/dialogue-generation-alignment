B|158| M: [that's why] [they call it] [the] [north .] 
A|159| A: [it's [,] uh ,] _when_ [you] come [to] [this] part _of the_ country , we've [been] away [from] dallas long enough [that] [you] _see the_ difference [in] housing .

B|170| M: [i] [do] [, i think it's] weird [how many] [people say] [they] [don't] [live [in] a] [place that] matters . 
A|171| A: uh-huh . 
B|172| M: [well [,] if] [you're] [a] native american [, you] should _probably be_ . 
A|173| A: [i _know] _,_ and_ _it _,_ and_ _the economy_ [here] [in] dallas [, i] [mean] _, it [,_ it's] steady [, but _it's] still_ [not going] [up] . 
B|174| M: [it's] [because] [of [the] [economy] [,] not] [the] [people] . 
A|175| A: [and] [i ,] [um [,] i] [just] refuse [to] buy _it ,_ [um [,] if] [i know [i'm] not going to] [be] there [for] _at_ least five years [, [uh _,] you] [,_ you [know] .]

B|180| M: [i [,] and [,] right .] 
A|181| A: [and] [they] thought [they] were getting [a great deal] , [um ,] [because] [they] [could] get [a] five hundred thousand dollar home [with] , [they call [it] ,] zero [lot] lines [, no] property [, and] [it] would [make] [you] ill [to] _see_ [this] . 
B|182| M: i'll , yuh , money
