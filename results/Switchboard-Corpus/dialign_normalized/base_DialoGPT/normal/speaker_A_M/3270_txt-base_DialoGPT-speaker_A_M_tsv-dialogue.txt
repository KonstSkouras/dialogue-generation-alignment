B|12| M:  
A|13| A: _and_ it _was_ [just] [, i] mean [you] can _go to_ k-mart _and_ buy them [for] [, uh ,] eight dollars or _i think_ six dollars or whatever [for] toilet seats ,

B|20| M: [you know ,] _there_ _are_ [some] _things that are_ [better] _than_ _this ,_ [like] [the] way _the government_ works . 
A|21| A: [than] we [think] . [sure] . [sure] . 
B|22| M: [so] what's your _point_ ? 
A|23| A: uh-huh . it [sure] [is] . [the] , [you know ,] as _far_ as [, [i] think] [there] _was_ something [with [the] government] official [that] went on conferences [for] two days [and] actually [, uh ,] [the] conferences were nothing but [, uh ,] [you know ,] [they're] getting paid [for] [this [,] and] it _was_ something more [than] [just] [the] conferences . _they_ were using it as eating out _, uh , when_ [you] [think] _about_ _people_ [, uh ,] taking vacations these big [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|24| M: [you] . 
A|25| A: [the] rest _of_ them taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' _money for_ [that] . 
B|26| M: [i] love how [is] [the] [idea] [of course] [they] _have a_ bunch [of] [the military] [spending] , [military] _spending [money_ .] 
A|27| A: [and] [it's] [a] real big crunch [, uh] 
B|28| M: [the] . 
A|29| A: [of course] _, when they_ get _caught_ then [they're] , [you know ,] [they're] guilty [of course] , but [, uh ,] during [that] time [i'm] [sure] there's hundreds [of] [, uh ,] thousands _of people_ [that are] [, uh ,] [spending money] [that] does [not] belong [to] them . [so ,] 
B|30| M: [what] [about] [the] millions [of people] who [have] never been [caught] ? 
A|31| A: uh-huh . 
B|32| M: [uh [,] uh [, when] they] catch [you] , uh'uh 
A|33| A: [sure] . 
B|34| M: [well [,] uh [,] uh] huh . 
A|35| A: uh-huh . exactly . [and] [i don't] [think] [, uh [,] it's] ended up _being_ [, i] mean it gave [people] jobs 
B|36| M: [that's] _a lot of_ [money [for] a] country [that] [was] [so] [far] away from [being] [the] most powerful nation [in] [the] world . 
A|37| A: but [i think] it also cost , um , quite [a] bit as [far] as because after [they're] [done] [with the] war , [a lot of] [things] were no longer put [to] use . [i] mean it [was] kind [of] [like] , okay , we'll do [this] during [this] [point] [and] time but after [that] [that's] , [you know [,] uh] [they] didn't want [to] do it anymore . 
B|38| M: yeah 
A|39| A: [so ,] [a lot of] [things that are] saying [that] [they're] no longer going [to] be doing [for] next wars [that are] coming up [that] [they] did [for] [this] [one] [in] getting rid [of] [a lot of] [things] . [so] [i don't know .] 
B|40| M: [they] [are] [done] 
A|41| A: okay , [well ,] it [was] good talking [to] [you] [and] [have a] good evening .
