B|62| M: [i don't] [i don't] _i [have_ no] idea . 
A|63| A: [so] [most] [of the] [it's] almost twenty years [old] _and_ [most] [of the] houses [around] here were built pretty much _the same_ style [uh] [we [have] a] friend [that] lives two blocks over _and_ his _house is_ almost identical [to] us except his [is] three bedrooms _and_ ours [is] four 
B|64| M: [yeah] [um] 
A|65| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty much _the same_ . [so i] [i think] [most] [of] [them] [are] there [was] [it] [like] [most] areas [that] [are] built [um] there were probably [like] two or three styles [you] could choose from 
B|66| M:  ... 
A|67| A: _and_ _and_ [uh] [that's] pretty much all [the] houses [in the] area [for] probably [a] square mile [i'd say] at least maybe even [a] little [bit] more than [that .]

B|78| M: [i] can't [say] i've ever heard _of [a_ home] builder . 
A|79| A: [yeah] [so _i] just_ wondered [you] [know if] [the] whole area [was] [like that] or
