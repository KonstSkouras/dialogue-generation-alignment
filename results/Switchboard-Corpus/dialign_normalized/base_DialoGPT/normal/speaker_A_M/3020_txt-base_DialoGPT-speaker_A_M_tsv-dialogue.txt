B|8| M: _i'm_ sorry _, what_ ? 
A|9| A: [and] [we] decided _that_ [i] , i've never _been to_ africa _and i_ needed _to_ get _that_ continent since [i] hadn't [been] [there] yet . [and] _it_ _, it's_ , actually _it's a_ fairly common vacation _place_ for french [people] _to_ _go_ [and] _they_ speak french [and] , _so_ , _uh _,_ you_ _know_ , [in] _that_ sense _is_ just _a little bit_ easier 
B|10| M: uhm ... 
A|11| A: [and] _it_ just seemed _like it_ _would_ _be_ [a] _fun_ _place_ _to_ _go_ . [and] , _so_ [we] , [we] didn't _really_ [have] enough time .

B|42| M: _i'm_ sorry _, i'm_ _not_ sure [what] [you] mean . 
A|43| A: [and] [the] other cities [it] wasn't nearly as _bad_ [and] [a] couple [of] them [it was] [, what] [we] _did_ [in] [some] [of] [the] other cities [and] [they] tell [you] [to] _do that_ [is] [to] hire [a] local guide

A|67| A: yes . if _you like_ wildlife _, [it's_ a] fabulous vacation . 
B|68| M: _i'm_ glad [you [like] _it] ._ 
A|69| A: if _you don't_ [like] wildlife [it's] probably [not] [of] interest [but] [it] , [that] [was] _really_ , _really_ fabulous [and] just [the] photos [i have] [of] [it] [and] gosh , incredible [and] [be] [so] close , 
B|70| M: _i'm [a_ little bit] jealous . 
A|71| A: um , august , eighty-eight . 
B|72| M: [what] [year] ? 
A|73| A: _and then_ , actually , after [there] _i went to_ um , _hawaii_ , [a lot of] my travel has [been] sort [of] based around conferences or business meetings 
B|74| M: [it's] [in september] . 
A|75| A: [and] [so] [, _i] went _to_ hawaii_ _and then_ [to] _australia_ [and] _japan_ [and] _china_ , 
B|76| M: [i went [to] the] same [place] [, [and] then] [went _to] a_ different [place] _, but_ [then] [went] back [to hawaii] . 
A|77| A: [i] [, i] , actually [i] didn't _go_ diving . 
B|78| M: ohhh [yeah .] 
A|79| A: [i] [, i'm _a] diver_ [and] [so] , _that's_ , _that's_ actually [been] another [of] my favorite vacations has [been] taking [little] diving trips 
B|80| M: [uh [,] i'm] [not] [a diver] . 
A|81| A: [but] , [uh _,] no_ [i] didn't get _to the great barrier reef_ . [i] drove from sidney down [to] melbourne [and] over [to] adelaide . 
B|82| M: [did you] [go] [to the great barrier reef] ? 
A|83| A: [it's] gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . [the] coastline [was] just incredible _. it's_ huge . 
B|84| M: hmmm _, i think_ [i] [might] _go there_ . 
A|85| A: _australia ._ [yeah .] 
B|86| M: [you] mean [the great barrier reef] ? 
A|87| A: [uh [,] but] , 
B|88| M: [the] coast [of] [australia .] 
A|89| A: [i] [don't] remember if [i] had _shrimp_ . 
B|90| M: [you don't] [have] [shrimp] ? 
A|91| A: [i] [don't] [think] [so] . 
B|92| M: [i'm] [in] [australia .] 
A|93| A: [oh] [, i] [like] [that] too . [but] , [uh ,] [in] fact [i] didn't eat out [that] _much_ [there] because [i was] traveling by myself [in a] car _, it_ [would] [have been] [, i think] , _much_ more _fun_ [to] [do] [it] [like] [in the] van , with [a] bunch [of people] . 
B|94| M: [that's] [not] [really] how [it] works . 
A|95| A: [but] , [uh ,] 
B|96| M: [no [,] [no] [,] it's] [not] [that] [fun] . 
A|97| A: uh-huh . 
B|98| M: _you're_ adventurous . 
A|99| A: _and [i_ was] by myself _in china_ too . 
B|100| M: [i [was] [in] china] 
A|101| A: [yeah .] 
B|102| M: [i'm] [not] seeing [you] 
A|103| A: [china] [was [a] little bit] more , [uh ,] [of] [a] challenge . [but] _, it_ _, it_ wasn't more [of] [a] challenge [in a] sense because [i] hired [a] guide [all] [the] time , 
B|104| M: [that's] [not] [a] [bad] idea . 
A|105| A: [and] [so] [i] never [, you] [know] , got out by myself , or [not] _much_ , 
B|106| M: [oh] . [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|107| A: [no ,] actually [i] paid _about_ either [a] thousand dollars or [a little bit] [, no] maybe [it was] _about_ [a] thousand dollars , maybe [a little bit] less [, i] [don't] [really] remember , for ten days including [all] my meals , [a] guide , [a] car , [the] airfare [and] [, but] [this] [is] from _hong kong_ , 
B|108| M: [hong kong] 
A|109| A: because [i was] already [in] [hong kong] [and] , um [, but] [it] [only] cost [you] _about_ [a] thousand dollars [to] [go there] _and [i_ went to] beijing , shanghai , chengdu [and] actually [then] [i] took [a] train up from shanghai [to [a] little] , quingdao [i think] [is the] name [of] [it _.] [it's_ [a] little] , [uh ,] sort [of] getaway retreat village [not] far from shanghai _. it's_ just [a] train ride . 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [and] [that] [, i] had two internal , [one] , [yeah] , two internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other things . [it was] [really] , 
B|112| M: [you .] 
A|113| A: uh-huh . 
B|114| M:  ... [and] [what] [about] how [do] [you] ? 
A|115| A: around [a] thousand . 
B|116| M: [i'm] sorry , how [much] [did you] make ? 
A|117| A: [oh] , japan's ridiculous . 
B|118| M: [there] are [some places] [where] [it's] [not] [that] expensive [, [and] i] live [in] [japan] . 
A|119| A: [and _i] stayed_ [, i] didn't stay [in the] top [of] [the] line hotels [but] _i stayed in_ , [they] were [all] completely clean , 
B|120| M: [i stayed in] [japan] [, [it] was] [like] [this] 
A|121| A: [and] [, you] [know] , [they] were newly built [and] [they] were sort [of] [the] lower end [of] [the] top [of] [the] line , hotels , because [they] said [you] can't stay [in the] cheap stuff . 
B|122| M: they're [not] even [that] expensive 
A|123| A: right . right . 
B|124| M: yup [. it's] [all] [about] [the] money 
A|125| A: [uh [,] but] [yeah] , [that] [was] [, i] highly recommend [that] [way to] [go] . if [you're] ever interested [in] going [the] route [, i] dealt with [this] woman , her name [was] rita [at] [china] tours [in] boston 
B|126| M: [china] 
A|127| A: [yeah .] [uh [,] and] [a] friend [of] mine who had gone for [a] business trip [to] [china] [and] she just gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and] [it] [would] [really] [be] [fun] [, i think] ideally with [like] two couples because [you have a] car [and] [a] driver [and] [a] guide 
B|128| M: can [you] [do that] ? 
A|129| A: [and then] ,
