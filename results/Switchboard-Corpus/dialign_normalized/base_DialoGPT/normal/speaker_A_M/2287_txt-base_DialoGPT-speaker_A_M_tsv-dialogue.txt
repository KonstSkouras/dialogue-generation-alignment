A|1| A: yeah _you're_ _not sure_ where _to_ _go_ _and_ _vote_ _and_ all _that ._ 
B|2| M: _you know_ _i voted_ _for_ _a lot _of_ the_ local _candidates_ . 
A|3| A: right _or_ [you] _don't _know_ what_ _they_ [you know] where _they_ stand _or_ anything _like that ._ 
B|4| M: _so_ [you know] [they] 
A|5| A: yeah _i think_ _you're_ right . 
B|6| M: _i'm_ [not sure] _but_ _i'm_ pretty [sure] _it's_ _a lot_ . 
A|7| A: yeah _or_ sometimes _they _don't_ like_ either [of the] choices _for the_ [candidates] 
B|8| M: _that's_ [the] main reason [i] dislike _it_ . 
A|9| A: [so] [they] _think_ _well_ [you know] _why_ _vote ._ 
B|10| M: _i'm_ [not sure] _if_ [they] [like] _each_ _other_ _or not ._ 
A|11| A: yeah really especially _in_ _texas_

A|13| A: [it] really was yeah . 
B|14| M: [well] _that's_ how _it's_ supposed _to _be_ ._ 
A|15| A: yeah did [they] get [the] _serious problem_ _that_ half [the] people [don't] _vote ._ 
B|16| M: _is_ [that] _a_ [serious problem] ? 
A|17| A: yeah . 
B|18| M: _oh_ . [well] _it's_ [it] . 
A|19| A: yeah _. it_ also seems [like] [maybe] another candidate [that] nobody wants could slip _in_ _if [you_ know] [not] enough people [are] _voting_ . 
B|20| M: [i think] _it's_ pretty obvious [that] this _is_ _a_ bad idea . 
A|21| A: yeah [it's] kind [of] [like] _in_ louisiana where [that] _uh_ _guy_ [that's] [like] [a] ku klux klan member something _got elected_ . 
B|22| M: [what] ? 
A|23| A: kind [of] scary when _you think_ _about_ _that ._ 
B|24| M: [it's] [not] 
A|25| A: [oh] gosh . 
B|26| M: aha ! _i can't_ ! 
A|27| A: yeah . 
B|28| M: hey [that's] [the] [guy] who shot [the] police officer [that] shot [the] [guy] _in the_ 
A|29| A: yeah people _will_ sit home _and_ assume [oh] [that] [guy] would never get _elected_ . 
B|30| M: [you're] assuming [that .] 
A|31| A: next [thing] [you know] _you've_ _got_ _him_ . 
B|32| M: [well] [you've] certainly [got] me there . 
A|33| A: yeah . 
B|34| M: [if you] [go] [to] [a] polling station [you know] who _is_ [the] president [of _the] party_ . 
A|35| A: right yeah . 
B|36| M: _i'm_ pretty [sure] _you can_ [vote] [if you] [vote] [for] me [i] [will] . 
A|37| A: yeah . right . 
B|38| M: _he_ [got elected] _but_ [i think] [it's] [a] _bit_ [of] [a] stretch [to] call [him] [the] president . 
A|39| A: yeah [he] [sure] did . 
B|40| M: [i think] [he] [got elected] _in the_ wrong state . 
A|41| A: yeah . [i think] one [thing] [that] [maybe] would help people [vote] [is] [if] [the] polls were either open _more_ days [or] [you] could mail [it] [in] [or] something [like] [if _you] have_ [if _you] have_ real strict _work_ hours _and_ [you can] only [go] [like] at seven [in the] morning [or] after _work_ _and_ _you have_ [to] stand [in] line [for] [so] _long_ 
B|42| M: [i] [like] this idea . 
A|43| A: [i think] [that] discourages [a lot of] people . 
B|44| M: how _do_ [you] feel _about the_ [voting] _system_ ? 
A|45| A: uh-huh . 
B|46| M:  ... [uh] ... [what] ? 
A|47| A: right . 
B|48| M: [i] . [know] [. it] . beyond . your . mind 
A|49| A: uh-huh . 
B|50| M: _i don't think_ there's [a] reason [for] [you] [to] [vote .] 
A|51| A: yeah [i'm] [in] dallas _and_ they're _long_ here too . 
B|52| M: [you [know] what] ? [i'm] [not] [a] fan [of the] cowboys _but_ they've [got] [a lot of] _good_ things _going_ _on_ . 
A|53| A: yeah [i voted] absentee one year . [i] really was [going] [to be] gone _. so_ [i] did [it] [but] [uh] [it] was nice . [i] would [be] tempted _to do_ [it] _again ._ 
B|54| M: [i voted] [for the] first _time_ [in] my life . [i'm] [not sure] i'd [be] able [to do] [that] [again .] 
A|55| A: right . 
B|56| M: [i] [vote] yes 
A|57| A: yeah . [i _think] they_ _should_ change [the] whole [system] [so] [that] [it's] easier 
B|58| M: [why] ? [it's] [a] _good_ idea . 
A|59| A: [i think] _more_ people would [do] [it] [if] [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|60| M: [and] [it's] been [a] [long] _time_ since we had [a] [system] [like that .] 
A|61| A: uh-huh 
B|62| M: [i'm] [not] [that's] _just_ 
A|63| A: yeah [that] would [be .] [i] usually [vote .] [a lot of] times i'll [vote] [a] straight [party] ticket [just] _because_ [i don't] take [the] [time] [to] find out [what] every [you know] [other] than [the] major [candidates] [what] [they] stand [for] [on] [what] issues 
B|64| M: [work] . 
A|65| A: [so] i'll [just] trust [well] [the party] kind [of] goes along these lines [so] i'll [go] ahead [and] [vote .] 
B|66| M: [i] [vote] 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| M: [i'm] sorry . 
A|69| A: yeah . 
B|70| M: [oh] [you] mean [that] 
A|71| A: _no_ _i guess_ it'd [be] best [if you] knew [each] person [and] [what] [they] stood [for] [and] [why] [and] everything . 
B|72| M: [so] ... [i guess] [i] [should] 
A|73| A: right [and] try [to] determine [if] [what] [you] read was objective [or not .] 
B|74| M: [you know] . 
A|75| A: yeah . 
B|76| M: this isnt [a] story its [a] compilation [of] [what] youve heard 
A|77| A: yeah . 
B|78| M: [because] [the] media [is] biased . [not] [the] case with [the] elections . [but] we [do] [have] elections . [they] [are] very important [. so] . [do] . [they] . [like] [. it] . much . much [more] . 
A|79| A: yeah . 
B|80| M: [it's] [a] joke 
A|81| A: yeah [i think] [it] could affect [the] outcome [you know] could make [it] unfair . 
B|82| M: [it's] [just] [a] joke . [it's] [not] even funny . 
A|83| A: [oh] yeah . 
B|84| M: [the] election _has_ been [in the] works [for] [a] while . 
A|85| A: yeah _the press_ [has] [a lot of] power . 
B|86| M: [that's] true . 
A|87| A: yeah [oh] [but] boy [you] try get into [that] you'd really open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|88| M: [you have] [a] point . [they] [have] [no] control over [the press] [they] _can't_ control [the press] . 
A|89| A: yeah seems [that] [they] [should] regulate themselves [a] little [bit] [and] [i don't _think] they_ ever _care_ [to] . 
B|90| M: [i'm] [not] saying [they don't] [i'm] [just] saying 
A|91| A: [well] [i can't] [think] [of] anything else really [about the] polls [or] [voting] [to] talk [about] . 
B|92| M: [do] [you [think] they] [care] ? 
A|93| A: [well] [it] was [good] talking _to you_ .
