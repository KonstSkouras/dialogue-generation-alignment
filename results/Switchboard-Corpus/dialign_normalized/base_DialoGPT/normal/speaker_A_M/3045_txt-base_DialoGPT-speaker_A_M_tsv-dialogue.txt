A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| M: [have you ever] heard [of the] _word_ [, uh] . 
A|45| A: _right_ . 
B|46| M: uhhh . _it's a_ _thing_ 
A|47| A: [yeah ,] [yeah] . [that's] probably where you've [used it] . 
B|48| M: _i've_ [used] [a] few [of] [them] . 
A|49| A: uh-huh . [yeah] . _um _,_ [i_ have] [that] on [my] [, uh ,] computer _here_ and also _, um _,_ i do_ some work at u t d and [, uh ,] [that's] _what_ [they] [have] there and [it] was [just] [so] nice [to] be [able] [just] [to] step into [the] position and , and already _know_ [the] _you know ,_ already _know_ [the] , [the] software . and _, um _,_ _i_ don't know_ from [my] own experience _, um ,_ wordperfect _is_ [just] [so] much better than , than wordstar at least [the] version [of] wordstar [that i] [used] _to have_ . [it] may be improved [by] now _but ,_ 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: [yeah ,] [it's] [, uh ,] wordstar was [never] very intuitive [to] [me] . [i] mean _you know _,_ _you_ ,_ some [of the] commands [just] had nothing [to] [do] with _, you know _,_ what_ [you were] supposed [to] be doing _what_ [they] _, what_ [they] [did] on [the] computer _but [,_ uh ,] 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: [i] mean _like_ _going_ _, um ,_ forward and backward [a] [word] or up and down [a] line [that] sort [of] [thing] [just] _, you know ,_ didn't match with [the] kinds [of] keys _, [you_ were] using . 
B|54| M:  ..., 
A|55| A: [yeah] . 
B|56| M: [it's] [like] [, you know [,] i] _can_ 
A|57| A: and , [but] wordperfect _is_ [just] [a] lot more intuitive [in a] lot [of] ways . and _you ,_ and [it] does [a] lot [of] things _too_ [that] if _you ,_ if [you] [do] any kind [of] [, uh ,] research or anything [like] [that] where [you _have] to_ [, uh ,] use footnotes , [it] _is_ [just] wonderful . because [it] keeps track [of] all _your_ footnotes . 
B|58| M: [i] 
A|59| A: [yeah ,] and if [you] add [it ,] if [you] put [a] footnote [in] , [in the] middle [, you know ,] if [you] come up with some new piece [of] documentation and [you] put [that] [in the] middle [of] _your_ paper and _have to_ footnote [it [,] you] [just] change _, um ,_ [it] [just] automatically changes all _your_ footnoting numbers [for] _you ._ 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: [so] [, you know ,] [it's] [just] , 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: [yeah] . [yeah] . and _i think about_ [how] [it] [used] [to] be if [you were] doing [a] paper and [you] had [to] go back and retype everything , and oh , [it] was [just] awful . [so] _, um [,_ _i] don't know_ [i think] [we have] [just] become [really] spoiled . [but] [i think] , [it's a] nice kind [of] way [to] be spoiled 
B|64| M:  
A|65| A: [so] _, um ,_ well [, [i] have] [not really] paid much attention because [i] clock , although [i think we've] probably [been] talking at least ten minutes [so] _, um ,_ if _you _,_ um ,_ unless [you have] some other things [you] want [to] talk _about_ as having [to] [do] with p c 
B|66| M: [i think about] ? 
A|67| A: well _, um [,_ i] was [a] technical writer [for] many years _, um ,_ 
B|68| M: [you .] 
A|69| A: and [my] husband and [i] actually met [in a] computer company . _um [,_ i] was [a] tech writer and he was [an] engineer . and [, uh [,] so i] [did] tech writing [for] [a] number [of] years . 
B|70| M: [this is] weird . 
A|71| A: oh , _sure ._ 
B|72| M: [um [,] um [,] um] . 
A|73| A: [got a] problem , [huh] ? [um ,] 
B|74| M: hehehe . 
A|75| A: oh . trying [to] figure out _what_ all [that] was [about] , [huh] ? 
B|76| M: [i don't know] _. i'm_ [just] gonna leave [it] [here .] 
A|77| A: _but [,_ um [,] [i] have] [, um ,] [that] , [that] was [the] majority [of] [my] writing although [, um [,] [i] have] also done oh , free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . and [, um ,] [for] [a] while [i] had [a] [, um [,] uh ,] [a] partnership with [a] , [in] [an] advertising agency with another woman who [is] [a] , [an] artist . [so i] [did] some advertising and p r _but ,_ 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: [um ,] now [i'm] , actually [i'm] _, i'm not_ working anymore [. i'm] [a] student [, i'm] [a] graduate student [so] [i'm] doing [a] lot [of] writing _but [,_ uh ,] now all [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|80| M: [what] [do [you] [,] i [do] you] ? 
A|81| A: [i've] done [a little] , [a] lot [of] different kinds , [but] [i] [, i] [just] [know] _right_ now [that i] couldn't [have] put out half [of] [what] [i] [did] if [that] much without [the] being [in] computers [so] [that's] [been] [really] great . and [, uh [,] i'm] [, so] [i'm] real spoiled . 
B|82| M: [i] 
A|83| A: [yeah] . 
B|84| M: what's [your] day 
A|85| A: uh-huh . [yeah] . 
B|86| M: heh [. i'm] ... [not] [a] bit . 
A|87| A: _good_ . 
B|88| M: [how] [do [you] know] [about] [that] ? 
A|89| A: [that's] great . 
B|90| M: [i] [know] . 
A|91| A: [yeah] . 
B|92| M: [so] ? 
A|93| A: well , [those] [are] skills [that] [she] certainly [is] _going to_ need early on and [, you know ,] [the] , and [it] seems [like] [it's] getting earlier and earlier with [the] children . 
B|94| M: [you know [,] i'm not] [sure .] 
A|95| A: [so] [, um _,] i think_ [that] [that] would be [a] real , [a] real [, uh ,] advantage [to] , [to] her _to have_ [that] and [, uh ,] [do] [it] early , 
B|96| M: she's [a little] [too] smart [for] [that] . 
A|97| A: [so] [. [uh] ,] [do] 
B|98| M: [i think] she's [going [to] [have] to] make [a] joke [about] [that] [first] [, i think] 
A|99| A: oh , neat . 
B|100| M: [i] [know ,] [right] ? 
A|101| A: yes . [right] . oh , great . 
B|102| M: [it's] ok . 
A|103| A: [right] 
B|104| M: [but [,] what] [about] [it] ? 
A|105| A: [that's] great . well , [that's] [a] , [that's] [a] skill [that] [she] [can] use [for] [the] rest [of] her life [, so] might as well start now , [huh] ? 
B|106| M: she's [a] [good] [boy] . 
A|107| A: well , nola [i have] enjoyed talking with [you] thoroughly . [this is] [really] [going to] be fun [i think] , 
B|108| M: [i don't know] . 
A|109| A: and [, um ,] [my] husband [is] [a] ham radio operator and [i think about] all [the] people [that] he talks [to] all over [the] ,
