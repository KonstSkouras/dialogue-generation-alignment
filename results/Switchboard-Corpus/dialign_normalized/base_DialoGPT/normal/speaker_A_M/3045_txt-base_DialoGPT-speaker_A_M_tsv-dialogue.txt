B|34| M: _i'm _not_ really_ [i'm] _just_ ... 
A|35| A: [yeah] ours [really] needs _to have_ some work done on _it_ [but] [but] then [my] husband _um_ worked at t [i] and [i] [got a] _um_ [this] has [been] years ago he doesn't work there anymore [but] he [got a] _um_ [uh] [the] [the] t [i] professional and brought [that] home and [i] learned wordstar on [that] 
B|36| M: [it]

A|39| A: uh-huh . 
B|40| M: _how_ _did_ [you] learn [uh] . learn ?

B|42| M: _i've_ _never_ [ever _used] it_ 
A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| M: [have you ever] heard [of the] _word_ [uh] . 
A|45| A: _right_ . 
B|46| M: uhhh . _it's a_ _thing_ 
A|47| A: [yeah] [yeah] . [that's] probably where you've [used it] . 
B|48| M: _i've_ [used] [a] few [of] [them] . 
A|49| A: uh-huh . [yeah] . _um_ [i have] [that] on [my] [uh] computer _here_ and also _um_ _i do_ some work at u t d and [uh] [that's] _what_ [they] [have] there and [it] was [just] [so] nice [to] be [able] [just] [to] step into [the] position and and already _know_ [the] _you know_ already _know_ [the] [the] software . and _um_ _i don't know_ from [my] own experience _um_ wordperfect _is_ [just] [so] much better than than wordstar at least [the] version [of] wordstar [that i] [used] _to have_ . [it] may be improved [by] now [but] 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: [yeah] [it's] [uh] wordstar was [never] very intuitive [to] [me] . [i] mean _you know_ [you] some [of the] commands [just] had nothing [to] [do] with _you know_ _what_ [you were] supposed [to] be doing _what_ [they] _what_ [they] [did] on [the] computer [but] [uh] 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: [i] mean _like_ _going_ _um_ forward and backward [a] [word] or up and down [a] line [that] sort [of] [thing] [just] _you know_ didn't match with [the] kinds [of] keys [you were] using . 
B|54| M:  ... 
A|55| A: [yeah] . 
B|56| M: [it's] [like] [you _know] i_ _can_ 
A|57| A: and [but] wordperfect _is_ [just] [a] lot more intuitive [in a] lot [of] ways . and [you] and [it] does [a] lot [of] things _too_ [that] if [you] if [you] [do] any kind [of] [uh] research or anything [like] [that] where [you _have] to_ [uh] use footnotes [it] _is_ [just] wonderful . because [it] keeps track [of] all _your_ footnotes . 
B|58| M: [i] 
A|59| A: [yeah] and if [you] add [it] if [you] put [a] footnote [in] [in the] middle [you know] if [you] come up with some new piece [of] documentation and [you] put [that] [in the] middle [of] _your_ paper and _have to_ footnote [it] [you] [just] change _um_ [it] [just] automatically changes all _your_ footnoting numbers [for] _you ._ 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: [so] [you know] [it's] [just] 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: [yeah] . [yeah] . and _i think about_ [how] [it] [used] [to] be if [you were] doing [a] paper and [you] had [to] go back and retype everything and oh [it] was [just] awful . [so] _um_ _i don't [know_ [i] think] [we have] [just] become [really] spoiled . [but] [i think it's a] nice kind [of] way [to] be spoiled 
B|64| M:  
A|65| A: [so] _um_ well [i have] [not really] paid much attention because [i] clock although [i think we've] probably [been] talking at least ten minutes [so] _um_ if [you] _um_ unless [you have] some other things [you] want [to] talk _about_ as having [to] [do] with p c 
B|66| M: [i think about] ? 
A|67| A: well _um_ [i] was [a] technical writer [for] many years _um_ 
B|68| M: [you .] 
A|69| A: and [my] husband and [i] actually met [in a] computer company . _um_ [i] was [a] tech writer and he was [an] engineer . and [uh] [so i] [did] tech writing [for] [a] number [of] years . 
B|70| M: [this is] weird . 
A|71| A: oh _sure ._ 
B|72| M: [um] [um] [um] . 
A|73| A: [got a] problem [huh] ? [um] 
B|74| M: hehehe . 
A|75| A: oh . trying [to] figure out _what_ all [that] was [about] [huh] ? 
B|76| M: [i don't know] _. i'm_ [just] gonna leave [it] [here .] 
A|77| A: [but] [um] [i have] [um] [that] [that] was [the] majority [of] [my] writing although [um] [i have] also done oh free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . and [um] [for] [a] while [i] had [a] [um] [uh] [a] partnership with [a] [in] [an] advertising agency with another woman who [is] [a] [an] artist . [so i] [did] some advertising and p r [but] 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: [um] now [i'm] actually [i'm] [i'm not] working anymore [. i'm] [a] student [i'm] [a] graduate student [so] [i'm] doing [a] lot [of] writing [but] [uh] now all [of the] scholastic majors though 
B|80| M: [what] [do you] [i [do] you] ? 
A|81| A: [i've] done [a little] [a] lot [of] different kinds [but] [i] [i] [just] _know right_ now [that i] couldn't [have] put out half [of] [what] [i] [did] if [that] much without [the] being [in] computers [so] [that's] [been] [really] great . and [uh] [i'm] [so] [i'm] real spoiled . 
B|82| M: [i] 
A|83| A: [yeah] . 
B|84| M: what's [your] day 
A|85| A: uh-huh . [yeah] . 
B|86| M: heh [. i'm] ... [not] [a] bit . 
A|87| A: _good_ . 
B|88| M: [how] [do [you] know] [about] [that] ? 
A|89| A: [that's] great . 
B|90| M: [i] [know] . 
A|91| A: [yeah] . 
B|92| M: [so] ? 
A|93| A: well [those] [are] skills [that] [she] certainly [is] _going to_ need early on and [you know] [the] and [it] seems [like] [it's] getting earlier and earlier with [the] children . 
B|94| M: [you know] [i'm not] [sure .] 
A|95| A: [so] [um] [i think] [that] [that] would be [a] real [a] real [uh] advantage [to] [to] her _to have_ [that] and [uh] [do] [it] early 
B|96| M: she's [a little] [too] smart [for] [that] . 
A|97| A: [so] [. uh] [do] 
B|98| M: [i think] she's [going [to] [have] to] make [a] joke [about] [that] [first] [i think] 
A|99| A: oh neat . 
B|100| M: [i] [know right] ? 
A|101| A: yes . [right] . oh great . 
B|102| M: [it's] ok . 
A|103| A: [right] 
B|104| M: [but] [what] [about] [it] ? 
A|105| A: [that's] great . well [that's] [a] [that's] [a] skill [that] [she] [can] use [for] [the] rest [of] her life [so] might as well start now [huh] ? 
B|106| M: she's [a] [good] [boy] . 
A|107| A: well nola [i have] enjoyed talking with [you] thoroughly . [this is] [really] [going to] be fun [i think] 
B|108| M: [i don't know] . 
A|109| A: and [um] [my] husband [is] [a] ham radio operator and [i think about] all [the] people [that] he talks [to] all over [the]
