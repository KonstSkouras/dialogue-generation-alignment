A|43| A: _yeah_ . 
B|44| M: _i think_ it's [a benefit] [of] being a'long time'employee . 
A|45| A: [right .] [right] _well_ [i] guess [that's] [a] [good] point [uh] 
B|46| M: [i'm] [just] _not_ [really] interested [in] any [of] [that] . 
A|47| A: [i] [do] belong [to] [a] [a] large corporation _or_ [my] [that] where [i'm] currently employed [and] there's [uh] there's some different things [uh] one [that] you've already mentioned [is] [is] health _insurance ._ [i think] through our health [insurance] [that] [i] can [get] better rates as [a] through _a group_ plan as opposed [to] going out [and] getting health [insurance] on an individual basis because [i] had [to] [do] [that] at one time when [i] wasn't employed with [a] large corporation 
B|48| M: [i] 
A|49| A: [and] [that] got _to be_ somewhat expensive so [i] [i think] one [of the] benefits [i] [i] see [is] [the] [uh] [is] [the] _group_ [uh] _group_ discount . 
B|50| M: it's [a] business . 
A|51| A: [yes .] 
B|52| M: yup . 
A|53| A: [yes] [and] [that's] [that's] one thing [i] [do] [have] . 
B|54| M: _but_ [you] [have] [the] option [to be] _in _a_ family_ [or] [a group] . 
A|55| A: if [i] didn't [have [a] family] [i don't] [think] [i] would [have] as as [a] male [or] as [a] as an individual [of] [in] this stage [of] [my] life [i don't] [think] [i] would _have insurance_ [uh] other 
B|56| M: _i mean_ [you] _don't have_ [to be] rich [to] [have [insurance] .] 
A|57| A: [i don't] [think] [i] would go through [that] expense . one other [benefit] [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [i] [really] enjoyed because they had [what] [was] called flex schedule where [i] could go _and i_ could [work] [uh] nine hour [days] [and] [have] [like] friday only [work] four hours 
B|58| M: [i] 
A|59| A: [or] [i] could [do] [uh] [work] four [days a week] at ten hours [a] day [and] [have a] [you know] three day weekend . [and] make [uh] make [my] job flexible [in] [that] case . 
B|60| M: [work] [i'm] [uh] _yeah yeah_ 
A|61| A: _well_ basically [yeah] [i] had [to] [do] [that] [uh] [the] same [uh] [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year . [i mean] [uh] because [i was] [in a] [in a] position [of] management [i] had responsibilities over [people] [that] _uh i_ needed [to] make [my] schedule [uh] so [that] if [i was] [not] there [i] would [have] coverage by some other management personnel 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: so so [i] [i think] [that] [uh] [that] [was] [a] [that] [was] an excellent [benefit] [that] [i] [really] enjoyed 
B|64| M: [you] 
A|65| A: _and [i_ don't have] [that] [in] [my] current operation [but] [uh you] mentioned [uh] flexible [work] schedule [and] [that's] [that's] [good .] 
B|66| M: i'd [have _a] uh_ [uh] . 
A|67| A: [and] [uh] [what] other benefits [do you] [think] are important ? 
B|68| M: [yeah] [uh [i] don't] [uh i] don t [i think] [uh] ... 
A|69| A: [yeah yeah] [that's] true . 
B|70| M: [you] said [uh] _retirement_ [and i] said uhh [you] said ... 
A|71| A: _well_ [and] [that's] an individual thing . 
B|72| M: [well] [i'm] sure [that's] why [i'm] still [in] school . 
A|73| A: [yeah] with [uh] with our current [uh] organization [we] [do] [have a] nice [retirement] package [and] also [a] [a] nice thing [that] [that] [we have] [in] our corporation [is] [a uh] [is] [a] profit sharing plan where [we] can [uh] participate [in the] [the] profits [of the] company . if [we're] [you know] if we've been there [a] while [and] [we're] vested [uh] which means [that] [you know] [we have a] an interest [uh] [in the] company [that] [we] can [uh] [get] some [of the] benefits [of the] either [the] profit high times [or] [or] [in a] sense suffer during [the] low times 
B|74| M: [i] 
A|75| A: [and] [uh] also [uh] [in] one [of] [my] wife's [uh] companies where [she] worked they'd had [a] real nice profit sharing plan [that] [that]
