B|46| M: [i'm] [just] _not_ [really] interested [in] any [of] [that] . 
A|47| A: [i] [do] belong [to] _a ,_ [a] large corporation _or_ [my] , [that] where [i'm] currently employed [and] there's _, uh ,_ there's some different things _, uh ,_ one [that] you've already mentioned [is] , [is] health _insurance ._ [i think] through our health [insurance] [that] [i] can [get] better rates as _a ,_ through _a group_ plan as opposed [to] going out [and] getting health [insurance] on an individual basis because [i] had [to] [do] [that] at one time when [i] wasn't employed with [a] large corporation 
B|48| M: [i] 
A|49| A: [and] [that] got _to be_ somewhat expensive , so [i] [i think] one [of the] benefits [i] [, i] see [is] [the] _, uh ,_ [is] [the] _group_ _, uh ,_ _group_ discount . 
B|50| M: it's [a] business . 
A|51| A: [yes .] 
B|52| M: yup . 
A|53| A: [yes [,] and] [that's] , [that's] one thing [i] [do] [have] . 
B|54| M: _but_ [you] [have] [the] option [to be] _in _a_ family_ [or] [a group] . 
A|55| A: if [i] didn't [have [a] family] [, i don't] [think] [i] would [have] , as , as [a] male [or] as _a ,_ as an individual [of] , [in] this stage [of] [my] life [, i don't] [think] [i] would _have insurance_ _, uh ,_ other , 
B|56| M: _i mean_ [, you] _don't have_ [to be] rich [to] [have [insurance] .] 
A|57| A: [i don't] [think] [i] would go through [that] expense . one other [benefit] [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [, i] [really] enjoyed because they had [what] [was] called flex schedule where [i] could go _and i_ could _work _,_ uh ,_ nine hour [days] [and] [have] [like] friday only [work] four hours 
B|58| M: [i] 
A|59| A: [or] [i] could [do] _, uh ,_ [work] four [days a week] at ten hours [a] day [and] _have a [,_ you know ,] three day weekend . [and] make _, uh ,_ make [my] job flexible [in] [that] case . 
B|60| M: [work ,] [i'm] [, uh _,] _yeah ,_ yeah_ 
A|61| A: _well ,_ basically [, yeah] [i] had [to] [do] , [that] [, uh ,] [the] same [, uh ,] [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year . [i mean] [uh ,] because [i was] [in _a] ,_ [in a] position [of] management [i] had responsibilities over [people] [that] _, uh , i_ needed [to] make [my] schedule [, uh ,] so [that] if [i was] [not] there [i] would [have] coverage by some other management personnel , 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: so , so [i] _, i think_ [that] [, uh ,] [that] [was] _a ,_ [that] [was] an excellent [benefit] [that] [i] [really] enjoyed 
B|64| M: [you] , 
A|65| A: _and [i_ don't have] [that] [in] [my] current operation , [but] [, [uh ,] you] mentioned [, uh ,] flexible [work] schedule [and] [that's] , [that's] [good .] 
B|66| M: i'd [have _a ,] uh [,_ uh] . 
A|67| A: [and] [, uh ,] [what] other benefits [do you] [think] are important ? 
B|68| M: [yeah [,] uh [, i] don't] [, uh , i] don t [, i think] [, uh] ... 
A|69| A: [yeah [, yeah] ,] [that's] true .

A|71| A: _well [,_ and] [that's] an individual thing . 
B|72| M: [well ,] [i'm] sure [that's] why [i'm] still [in] school . 
A|73| A: [yeah ,] with [, uh ,] with our current [, uh ,] organization , [we] [do] [have a] nice [retirement] package [and] also [a ,] [a] nice thing [that] , [that] [we have] [in] our corporation [is] [a , uh ,] [is] [a] profit sharing plan where [we] can [, uh ,] participate [in the] , [the] profits [of the] company . if [we're] [, you know ,] if we've been there [a] while [and] [we're] vested [, uh ,] which means [that] [, you know ,] [we [have a] ,] an interest [, uh ,] [in the] company [that] [we] can [, uh ,] [get] some [of the] benefits [of the] , either [the] profit high times [or] , [or] [in a] sense , suffer during [the] low times 
B|74| M: [i]
