B|0| M: _you_ _do_ realize _that's_ how _the death_ sentence works _right_ ? 
A|1| A: _and_ _uh_ i've seen _uh_ _a_ lot _of_ _people_ get convicted sentenced _and_ _then_ _just_ nothing happens _just_ endless endless endless appeals . 
B|2| M: _it's_ _not_ _that_ hard . _they just don't_ _have the_ power _to do it ._ 
A|3| A: _yeah_ _what's_ amazing _is_ some _of_ them [have] been on [death] row for _a_ number _of_ years . 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: _and_ _uh_ here _in_ maryland _i_ _know_ _we_ [have] _a_ _real_ problem _with_ overcrowding _in_ prisons _uh_ [just] 
B|6| M: _that_ . 
A|7| A: _yeah_ but _i_ mean _in_ here [it's] _uh_ [to] [the] point where _they were_ letting prisoners go . _uh_ commuting [the] sentences _of_ those [that] _were_ _in_ _in jail_ for lesser _crimes_ _in_ order [to] put more _people_ _in_ into [the] jails . 
B|8| M: _you_ _don't_ _have _to_ be a_ criminal _to be_ [in jail] . 
A|9| A: _and_ _it was_ [just] _uh_ amazing _to me_ _and_ _of_ course [they] made [a] big deal _out_ _of the_ [the] few [that] got _out_ _and_ turned around _and_ committed [a] crime within five days _of_ getting _out_ _and_ being rearrested an . 
B|10| M: [they] 
A|11| A: _uh i_ can't remember . refresh my memory . 
B|12| M: _what_ _happened_ . again . again . 
A|13| A: um _i don't_ remember myself . 
B|14| M: [is] _this_ [real] ? 
A|15| A: um _i_ _think_ _if_ [they] _if_ [they] started executing them on [a] regular basis _uh_ [that] _i_ _think_ [it] might make [a] difference . [right] now _i don't_ _see_ [it] making [a] difference . 
B|16| M: yes 
A|17| A: _i don't_ _see_ someone [not] going _out_ there _and_ _committing_ murder because _they're_ afraid _they're_ going [to] get sentenced [to] [death] . _i_ mean most _people_ _out_ there _committing_ murders [don't] _care ._ 
B|18| M: murdering 
A|19| A: [they just don't] _care ._ 
B|20| M: how _do_ [they] justify _this_ ? 
A|21| A: _yeah_ . 
B|22| M: [they] [don't] really [care .] [they just] punish [the] [people] _who_ _commit_ [crimes] . [they] [don't] _even_ [care] _about_ [the] [people] [committing] [crimes] . 
A|23| A: _yeah_ _yeah_ _and_ there's _uh_ there's [a] lot _of_ [people] here [in] baltimore [that] _uh_ [have] _and_ _we just_ had _uh_ [a] [real] big cocaine bust _and_ _of_ course [you] _know_ _they're_ _they're_ playing [it] _up_ [real] big [that] _it was_ looked like _it was_ [a] very very small ring _and_ [they just] [happened] [to] get lucky _and_ catch [the] _guy_ . 
B|24| M: [i] 
A|25| A: but [i] mean _uh_ baltimore has _uh_ an all _time_ record for [the] number _of_ deaths so far [this] year . [i] _think_ they've got over [a] hundred dead already [this] year . 
B|26| M: i'a . 
A|27| A: well [it's] kind _of_ [it's] kind _of_ moved _up_ _and_ [you] [have to] remember [that] [it] [it] [it] _uh_ there's [i] _think_ x number _of_ [people] _out_ there [that] _are_ going [to] [commit] murders 
B|28| M: [we] 
A|29| A: _and_ _uh_ once [you] kill off [a] few _of_ them 
B|30| M: you'll [see] i'll [commit] [i] 
A|31| A: [i] mean _if_ [you] murder [a] _guy_ because _he_ murdered your partner _or_ something like [that] [i] mean pretty soon [you] run _out_ _of_ [people] [to] murder . 
B|32| M: [what's] wrong [with] [that] ? 
A|33| A: _yeah_ . 
B|34| M: [then] 
A|35| A: _yeah_ . 
B|36| M:  
A|37| A: _yeah_ [you] _know_ [it] makes sense um [you] _know_ [you] [have the] occasional person [who] may [have] been falsely accused but [i] mean _uh_ so few _and_ far between _uh_ [you] _know_ makes good t v movies _and_ [that's] [about] [it .] 
B|38| M: ' 
A|39| A: _yeah_ . 
B|40| M: i'm . 
A|41| A: _yeah_ . 
B|42| M: [it's] . [about] . [a] . [about] . ''s . 
A|43| A: _yeah_ [i] had my _uh_ my father-in-law participated [in] [a] _uh_ [a] jury trial _he was_ _he was_ actually on [the] jury 
B|44| M: i'm [not] sure _what_ _you're_ _trying to_ say . 
A|45| A: _and_ _uh_ [this] man _was_ accused _of_ killing _uh i_ _think_ _it was_ two [people] _uh_ _and_ shooting [a] _uh_ policeman um point blank [in] [the] face . _of_ course _he_ didn't die . 
B|46| M: i'm [not] gonna lie . 
A|47| A: _and_ _uh_ [this] _was_ during [a] holdup _of_ [a] _uh_ _uh_ [a] restaurant _and_ [it] came _out_ during [the] trial [that] um [they] had tried [to] rob another place _and_ _uh_ when [the] _guy_ came _out_ [with] [the] bag [they] thought _was_ money [it] turned _out_ [to be a] couple cookies _and_ _uh_ [you] _know_ jumbo cookies _and and_ so _they were_ so upset from robbing [this] _guy_ [you] _know_ [trying [to] do] [this] holdup [that] didn't work [that] [they] quite literally _were_ mad _and_ went into [a] restaurant [to] hold [the] place _up_ _and_ [just] started [you] _know_ shooting [people] . 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: [you] _know_ [it's] 
B|50| M: [they] 
A|51| A: _yeah_ . _yeah_ _and_ get [even] [with] [who] [i] mean 
B|52| M: [yeah] [they're] [i don't] [they] [are] we're [we just] [they were] [we] [are] [and and] [they're] . 
A|53| A: [you] _know_ stupid guys [and] _uh_ [it] turned _out_ [that] [the] [you] _know_ policeman survived [to] [the] point _that _he_ was_ able [to] [you] _know_ identify [the] _guy_ . 
B|54| M: [i] [uh _i] don't know ._ 
A|55| A: [and] _of_ course [you] [know] [they] tried [to] make [the] cop look like _he was_ [uh] [a] [uh] _no_ good rotten drunk . 
B|56| M: _he said_ [he was] [and] _i don't know_ [that he] wasn't . 
A|57| A: [i] mean _it was_ amazing . 
B|58| M: [it was] 
A|59| A: oh _he was found_ guilty [yeah] . 
B|60| M: [he was found] innocent . 
A|61| A: [he] [uh] um last [i] heard [he] [uh] [he] beat [a] push for [the death] penalty . now whether [they] finally got [it] _or not_ [i don't know .] 
B|62| M: i'm [just] [trying to] figure [out] [if] [the] _other_ [guy] [was] [the] one [who] [was] beaten [up] [or not] . 
A|63| A: [i] kind _of_ [uh] stopped listening after [a] while . 
B|64| M: how [was] [the] whole thing ? 
A|65| A: um [you] [know] [he] would _come home_ [and and] [you] [know] after [the] trial [was] over [he] came _home_ [and] told us [what] [was] going on [and] _of_ course [then] [they] had [to] go back [to] [you] [know] after [he] had [to] go 
B|66| M: [i don't] [think] he'd ever [come home] [to me] 
A|67| A: [right] . [and] [uh] [yeah] everybody everybody [was] pretty much [you] [know] let's burn him . 
B|68| M: [it's] [just] [the] guilt [of the] [time] . 
A|69| A: [and] [that's] [you] [know] [that's] [the] way [they] wanted [to do it .] [and] [he was] surprised because [he] thought there [was] going [to be a] problem because [he] [uh] [you] [know] some [people] on [the] case [were] [were] [a] little hesitant on convicting him on some [of the] charges but [i] mean when [it] all came down [they just] within an hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|70| M: [what] . 
A|71| A: [yeah] . 
B|72| M:  ... 
A|73| A: [yeah] [yeah] well [it] [it] [it] went pretty pretty quick from [what] [he said] . 
B|74| M:  
A|75| A: but [i] mean there's there's there's [a] lot [of] [other] [crimes] [out] there [i] mean besides murder [i] [think] [uh] now [if] [you're] dealing drugs now caught more than twice [or] something [uh] [it] there's [uh] [a] [death] penalty associated [with] [it .] 
B|76| M: [no] . 
A|77| A: uh-huh . 
B|78| M:  . 
A|79| A: [yeah] [yeah] [i] agree . 
B|80| M:  
A|81| A: [yeah] [i] agree [i] i've [i] [have] [uh] [a] low tolerance for [that] kind [of] [uh] [that] kind [of] person . [and] [uh] as far as [uh] [you] [know] there [are] some some [other] [crimes] [that] [i] [think] [uh] [you] [know] [uh] kidnapping um [you] [know] when [they] [i] mean kidnapping per se has [a] certain [uh] [uh] fine [and] penalty associated [with] [it] 
B|82| M: [he] 
A|83| A: but um some [of] these [people] [are] [just] [out] [and] [out] brutal . [i] some [of the] cases i've heard [about] over [the] years
