B|78| M: [i] [know .] [i'm] [in] _east texas_ . 
A|79| A: [just] because there's [a friend] up there , [not] because there's [much] else 
B|80| M: why [are you] talking [about] [the] internet ? 
A|81| A: [for] colleges ? 
B|82| M: [i] [know ,] _right_ ? 
A|83| A: [well ,] [they're] [not] 
B|84| M: [i'm] _from_ _east texas_ . 
A|85| A: [they're] [not] _going to_ recruit me anymore [, i'm] through . [no] more [for] me . 
B|86| M: [the] _east texas_ _school_ [of] engineering _has a_ [very] large enrollment . 
A|87| A: [what] _, what_ [do you] [do] ? 
B|88| M: [i] [do] . 
A|89| A: [are you] _going to_ go [to] [east texas] [for] [that] ? 
B|90| M: i'll _be_ [going to] [a] _state_ _school_ [in the] northeast [, and] that'll _be_ [the] best part . 
A|91| A: that'd probably [be] [pretty] interesting . _i was_ summonsed down [to the] courthouse last week [. they] had summonsed eight hundred people , [about] four hundred showed up [, and] [it] _was_ [for a] murder trial . 
B|92| M: lol 
A|93| A: [this] [guy] had supposedly , uh , strangled [this] woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling down her throat [and] up her nose anyway , [this] [is] happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|94| M: [what] ? 
A|95| A: [and] [they] had us fill out [a] long questionnaire . we stayed till [about] [one] thirty [and] [they're] [going to] call [the] ones [that] [they're] interested [in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three at [a] time [and] [the] trial won't take place until _june_ . 
B|96| M: [june] 
A|97| A: [and] [they] _say_ [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . [and] [this] [guy] [in] front [of] me _said_ [, i] can't believe _i was_ summonsed . _i was_ an investigator [and _i] was_ tailing [the] woman [that] _was_ killed . [well ,] then [i have a friend] at [school] [that] [has a] boyfriend [that's a] lawyer [and] _he said_ [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] plano had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the] [one] [that's] accused _was_ [the] [one] [that] actually did [it .] [and] she [has] since taken off [with] another lawyer [who] had been , uh , getting cocaine [from] his client [and] then selling [it] [, and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited him [and] he's [going to] testify [for] [the] [state] against her _so_ he'll [have] his sentence reduced . 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: [yeah] . 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: [the] , [the] investigator . [yeah ,] [he] , [he] got off [right] away . 
B|102| M: [i] 
A|103| A: [and i] wrote [that] down on my questionnaire [that] _he'd_ _told_ me [that] , 
B|104| M: [he said] [he'd] _get_ [it] back . 
A|105| A: _so_ [i] figure [that] [that] will make me biased [and i] won't [be] chosen . 
B|106| M: [i'm] [not] sure [, [i] just] [know] [that] [i was] [told] [to] [say] [that] [i] wouldn't [have to] [say] anything . 
A|107| A: hopefully 
B|108| M: i'll [do] [it .] 
A|109| A: [yeah] . [no .] *aa 
B|110| M: [i mean [,] what] _would be_ [the] point [of] voting [for] [you ?] 
A|111| A: [i] [said] [that] [, i] could believe [in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but i] [would be] , i'd find [it] hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|112| M:  
A|113| A: [you [know] .] uh-huh . 
B|114| M: [i] [know .] 
A|115| A: [yeah] . [but] then [when] [you're] , [when] [you're] picked , see [i was] picked [for] another murder trial before 
B|116| M: [i'm] [so] sorry 
A|117| A: [oh ,] gosh [and] [it's] [so] hard because [, [you] know ,] everybody [is] wanting [to] go on [and] [get] [the] sentence done [, and] [if you're] trying [to] hold out [, [you] know ,] there's [so] [much] pressure on [you] [and] you've got [to] come up [with] [a] decision . 
B|118| M: [well]
