B|76| M: [it's] [just] [a] [good feeling] . 
A|77| A: [we had] [, uh ,] [we had] organizations [like] [that] [in] college [, you _know] ._ [we had a] community service _group_ [in] college [that] [had] all sorts [of] different groups [and] some did [like] [that] , some did elderly visits , 
B|78| M: _i [know_ .] 
A|79| A: some did [, uh ,] some did [, you know ,] _big brother_ , [big] sister , stuff [like] _that ._ [and] [i'm] convinced [that] , [that] , [that] at least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] [a] , some sort [of] _group_ . [you know ,] activity [like] _that ._ 
B|80| M: [there's] [a] [group] [for] [this] 
A|81| A: [you [know] .] twenty-five [, _i] don't_ [know .] twenty-five percent ? [a] asks someone else [in the] _yeah ,_ my wife [was] [big] [in] [that] 
B|82| M: yes , yes , yes . 
A|83| A: [and] [she] thinks , _yeah ,_ twenty-five percent _. it_ , _it [was_ a] small school 
B|84| M:  ... 
A|85| A: _but_ [, uh ,] _yeah _,_ but_ [, [i] mean ,] [a] , [a] , _a lot of people_ would [get] _involved_ [and] [, you know ,] _because_ there _were_ all different , organizations _to do_ . there [was] _big brother_ , [big] sister , 
B|86| M: [big brother] 
A|87| A: [they] [had a] yearly auction , [they] [had a] dance marathon [for] charity or , [to] , [to] support [that] , [group] . 
B|88| M: [they] [were] [the] most popular [, and they] [were] [the] first [to be] popular 
A|89| A: such [that] [, you know ,] lots _of people_ got _involved_ [that] way . 
B|90| M: [i'm] curious [about] [the] reason why [it was] done [, like] [the] [people who] [had] [the] _money_ 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| M: [oh] . [that's] cool . 
A|93| A: _yeah ,_ [no ,] neither [do] [i] . [i think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you [know] .] 
B|94| M: [you] _can_ [, but] [i] don'think [it's] going [to _be] [a_ lot of people] [getting] [involved] . 
A|95| A: _yeah [,_ they're] [not] worth [a] year . or some [people] [just ,] [just] [can't] even afford [it] [, you know ,] whatever . [i mean [,] the] peace corps doesn't pay very well . [you know ?] 
B|96| M: [that .] [about] [. [it] [.] it] 
A|97| A: [people] [get] shipped off [and] then [, you know [,] and] then [, and] then their parents [, [i] [have] a] [, uh ,] [a] , [a] friend whose , whose son [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala , or daughter [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: [i] ... 
A|99| A: [and] [, you know ,] he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and] [, you know [,] [i] know] [i] could _never_ afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] guatemala . 
B|100| M: [you] [can't] 
A|101| A: [you know ,] so 
B|102| M: [i] [can't] , 
A|103| A: so [i think] [, you know [,] and] [, and] [, [and] the] kid's certainly [not] making [much] [money] . 
B|104| M: she's [not] . 
A|105| A: so [i] [can] _see where_ [that] , [that] , may [be a] problem . 
B|106| M: [because [,] i] [can't] [see where] [the] line [is] drawn . 
A|107| A: [just] take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: [is] [she] [a] 
A|109| A: _yeah [,_ _i] don't ,_ 
B|110| M: [i] am [not] [, but] [i'm] going [to] try [to be] . 
A|111| A: _yeah ,_ _yeah ,_ well neither [can] [i ,] so [, [i] , [i] , [i] , [i] , [i] , [i] ,] did my service before [and] i'll [do] my little community service throughout [, but] _never_ _never_ _for a_ year _again_ . 
B|112| M: [i think] [you] [mean] [in the] sense [of] [never] having [to do] _anything_ [for a] month [again] 
A|113| A: so , so [i] guess our vote [is] [no] 
B|114| M: [i don't [,] i] don t [, i'm] [just] [here] [to help] . 
A|115| A: well [, it's] [been] nice talking [to] [you] [again] . 
B|116| M: [i'm] glad [you're] [here] 
A|117| A: well , _yeah _,_ _we're ,_ we're_ slowly [getting] everything back _together_ [again] . [you know ,] [it] [, it's] taking [time [,] but] everything [, you know ,] 
B|118| M: [yeah [,] i'm] sorry . 
A|119| A: [we] got lucky . [we had] [no] damage [to] our [house] or [anything] so [, the] rest will [just [have] to] come with [time] . 
B|120| M: [i'm] sure [the] [house] [is] fine . 
A|121| A: well , [good] luck [to] [you ,] [too] . 
B|122| M: [we're [, we're] [,] and we're] gonna [be] [together] [for a] while .
