A|59| A: [oh] _that's_ great . 
B|60| M: [i'm] _not_ saying [it's] [the] only [thing] [that's] keeping [me] [from] buying [a] _house_ . 
A|61| A: [and] [is that] supported by all donations [to] [the] church [and] so forth or 
B|62| M: [i] [get] _money_ 
A|63| A: [oh] so he 
B|64| M: [you] [uh i'm] pretty sure he's [a] man . 
A|65| A: [that's] real nice . 
B|66| M: he's _not_ donating _anything_ . 
A|67| A: right . 
B|68| M: [we have] [an] anime page 
A|69| A: [that] [that's] real _good_ . 
B|70| M: [just] [a] normal [one] .

B|72| M: [i'm] [doing] [it] _too_ 
A|73| A: [yeah .] 
B|74| M: _i mean_ [it's] [just] [a] bit [of] fun . 
A|75| A: [that's] [that's] [uh] [that's] real _good_ . 
B|76| M: [it's] [just] [a] [good feeling] . 
A|77| A: [we had] [uh] [we had] organizations [like] [that] [in] college [you _know] ._ [we had a] community service _group_ [in] college [that] [had] all sorts [of] different groups [and] some did [like] [that] some did elderly visits 
B|78| M: _i [know_ .] 
A|79| A: some did [uh] some did [you know] _big brother_ [big] sister stuff [like] _that ._ [and] [i'm] convinced [that] [that] [that] at least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] [a] some sort [of] _group_ . [you know] activity [like] _that ._ 
B|80| M: [there's] [a] [group] [for] [this] 
A|81| A: [you [know] .] twenty-five _i don't_ [know .] twenty-five percent ? [a] asks someone else [in the] [yeah] my wife [was] [big] [in] [that] 
B|82| M: yes yes yes . 
A|83| A: [and] [she] thinks [yeah] twenty-five percent _. it_ _it [was_ a] small school 
B|84| M:  ... 
A|85| A: _but_ [uh] [yeah] _but [i_ mean] [a] [a] _a lot of people_ would [get] _involved_ [and] [you know] _because_ there _were_ all different organizations _to do_ . there [was] _big brother_ [big] sister 
B|86| M: [big brother] 
A|87| A: [they] [had a] yearly auction [they] [had a] dance marathon [for] charity or [to] [to] support [that] [group] . 
B|88| M: [they] [were] [the] most popular [and they] [were] [the] first [to be] popular 
A|89| A: such [that] [you know] lots _of people_ got _involved_ [that] way . 
B|90| M: [i'm] curious [about] [the] reason why [it was] done [like] [the] [people who] [had] [the] _money_ 
A|91| A: [yeah .] 
B|92| M: [oh] . [that's] cool . 
A|93| A: [yeah] [no] neither [do] [i] . [i think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you [know] .] 
B|94| M: [you] _can_ [but i] don'think [it's] going [to _be] [a_ lot of people] [getting] [involved] . 
A|95| A: [yeah] [they're] [not] worth [a] year . or some [people] [just] [just] [can't] even afford [it] [you know] whatever . [i mean] [the] peace corps doesn't pay very well . [you know ?] 
B|96| M: [that .] [about] [. [it] [.] it] 
A|97| A: [people] [get] shipped off [and] then [you know] [and] then [and] then their parents [i [have] a] [uh] [a] [a] friend whose whose son [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala or daughter [is] [in the] peace corps [in] guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: [i] ... 
A|99| A: [and] [you know] he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and] [you know] [i know] [i] could _never_ afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] guatemala . 
B|100| M: [you] [can't] 
A|101| A: [you know] so 
B|102| M: [i] [can't] 
A|103| A: so [i think [you] know] [and] [and] [and the] kid's certainly [not] making [much] [money] . 
B|104| M: she's [not] . 
A|105| A: so [i] [can] _see where_ [that] [that] may [be a] problem . 
B|106| M: [because] [i] [can't] [see where] [the] line [is] drawn . 
A|107| A: [just] take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: [is] [she] [a] 
A|109| A: [yeah] _i don't_ 
B|110| M: [i] am [not] [but] [i'm] going [to] try [to be] . 
A|111| A: [yeah] [yeah] well neither [can] [i] so [i [i] [i] [i] [i] i] did my service before [and] i'll [do] my little community service throughout [but] _never_ _never_ _for a_ year _again_ . 
B|112| M: [i think you] [mean] [in the] sense [of] [never] having [to do] _anything_ [for a] month [again] 
A|113| A: so so [i] guess our vote [is] [no] 
B|114| M: [i don't] [i] don t [i'm] [just] [here] [to help] . 
A|115| A: well [it's] [been] nice talking [to] [you] [again] . 
B|116| M: [i'm] glad [you're] [here] 
A|117| A: well [yeah] _we're we're_ slowly [getting] everything back _together_ [again] . [you know] [it] [it's] taking [time] [but] everything [you know] 
B|118| M: [yeah] [i'm] sorry . 
A|119| A: [we] got lucky . [we had] [no] damage [to] our [house] or [anything] so [the] rest will [just [have] to] come with [time] . 
B|120| M: [i'm] sure [the] [house] [is] fine . 
A|121| A: well [good] luck [to] [you] [too] . 
B|122| M: [we're we're] [and we're] gonna [be] [together] [for a] while . 
A|123| A: bye-bye or 
B|124| M: ok bye .
