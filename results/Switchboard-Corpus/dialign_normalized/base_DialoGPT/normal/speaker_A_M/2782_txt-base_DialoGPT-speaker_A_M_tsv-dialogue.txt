B|18| M: _it [was_ just] [a] hypothetical . 
A|19| A: [and] then [we] put _that_ _on the_ computer [and] then [we] took _about_ three _months_ [and] _uh_ [and] adjusted where [we] _could_ come down [and] where [we] _didn't_ _want to_ come down 
B|20| M: [and] [what [we] had [to] _do] ._

A|69| A: [and] [it was] [for] [us] many years [for] many years .
