B|20| M: [i] _was just_ thinking [about that] _i think it_ would [be] [a] good idea [to] [have] _them_ _in [the_ _school] _and_ then_ _some_ . 
A|21| A: [and] _the one_ boy killed himself [a few] years ago [in the] _in a_ grade [school] _so_ [you] _know_ these kids [don't] [have] any trouble getting [a] hold _of_ guns [in] any [in] any neighborhood _doesn't_ seem _like_ . 
B|22| M: [and] [we] [have] [the] [two] most important gun rights [in the] world . 
A|23| A: _so_ . yeah [it's] kind _of_ scary [to] [think] [you] send your child [to] [school and] [you] wonder if he's [going to] get shot [. i] mean [we] didn't [have] [to] worry [about that] before .

B|46| M: [no] you're [the one] 
A|47| A: yeah [that] must [have] [been] at least fifty years ago or more [but] [the] point _of the_ story [is] [that] [that] [was] _so_ unbelievable [a] thing [in] those days [that] [it _was] in_ [all] [the] papers [all] _over_ [the] country [for] weeks 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: [but] [now] [you] [know] [you] wouldn't [probably] read [about] [it here] [in] texas
