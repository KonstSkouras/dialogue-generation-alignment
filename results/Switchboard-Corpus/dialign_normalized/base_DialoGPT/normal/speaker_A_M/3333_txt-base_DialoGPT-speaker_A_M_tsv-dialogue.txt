B|22| M: [and] [we] [have] [the] [two] most important gun rights [in the] world . 
A|23| A: _so_ . yeah _, it's_ kind _of_ scary [to] [think] , [you] send your child [to] [school] [and] [you] wonder if he's [going to] get shot [. i] mean , [we] didn't [have] [to] worry [about that] before .

B|46| M: [no ,] you're [the one] 
A|47| A: yeah , [that] must [have] [been] at least fifty years ago or more [, but] [the] point _of the_ story [is] [that ,] [that] [was] _so_ unbelievable [a] thing [in] those days [that] [it _was] in_ [all] [the] papers , [all] _over_ [the] country [for] weeks 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: [but] [now] , [you] [know ,] [you] wouldn't [probably] read [about] [it here] [in] texas

B|52| M: [what] [is] [it] ? 
A|53| A: uh-huh .

B|80| M: [that's] [the] best part . 
A|81| A: yeah [, uh [,] uh ,] isn't [that] [weird] ? 
B|82| M: uhh [, i think] [that's just] [weird] . 
A|83| A: [i] [know [,] [and , uh] ,] [the police] [are] [not] [going to] [do] anything until [they] , they've committed [some] sort [of] [a] crime . [you] [know ,] [he] [was just] begging [her] [on] [the] phone [, that's] [not] [doing] anything .
