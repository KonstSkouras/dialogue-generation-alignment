B|94| M: [that's] [a good] [thing] though . 
A|95| A: [and] _so_ [i] [kind of] stay

B|100| M: [it's] [all] [about the] [fish .] 
A|101| A: [i] [well] [yeah] . _so_ [i] am [and the] [the] [best] brand [of] chicken [to] buy [is] [the] [uh] pilgrim pride because _they don't_ use [all] these hormones [to] remote [uh] unnatural growth _in_ [their] products . 
B|102| M: [i'm] [well] _i'm [i_ don't] stop eating 
A|103| A: _so_ [i] [mean] _we have to_ [be] on [the] lookout _if we_ [want to] stay healthy .
