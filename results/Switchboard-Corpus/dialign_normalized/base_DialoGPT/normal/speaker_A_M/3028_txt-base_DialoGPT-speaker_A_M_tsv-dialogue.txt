A|101| A: [i] _, well ,_ [yeah] . _so_ [i] am [, [and] the] , [the] [best] brand [of] chicken [to] buy [is] [the] [, uh ,] pilgrim pride because _they don't_ use [all] these hormones [to] remote [, uh ,] unnatural growth _in_ [their] products . 
B|102| M: [i'm [,] well ,] _i'm , [i_ don't] , stop eating
