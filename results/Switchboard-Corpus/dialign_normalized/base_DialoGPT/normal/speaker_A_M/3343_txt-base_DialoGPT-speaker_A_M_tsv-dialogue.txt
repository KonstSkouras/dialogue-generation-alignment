B|28| M: [yeah [.] it's] [a] _very_ slow process _, but_ [we] can't [really] _do_ [anything] without [a] lemon . 
A|29| A: uh-huh , _and it_ _just_ pertained [to] _that_ 
B|30| M:  ... [and _it] was_ [just] _, you know ,_ _not_ _very_ 
A|31| A: [i] , at first [i] thought [of] food [, you know ,] [because] _that's_ [what] , mainly [what] [i] buy , [it] seems like , [and] [, uh [,] [you know ,] i] still [don't] [have] any , [anything] [to] [do] there [, but] [, but] [i] [, _i] think_ , too [, a lot of] people [don't] buy their warranties either [because] they [know] _that_ when [it's] _that_ old they're going [to] buy [a] new _one_ , 
B|32| M:  ...

B|36| M: [that] . 
A|37| A: [but] [, but] , [it was] interesting [to] [, i] [don't] [know] if they're making them better or [not] [, i] , [it's] hard [to] say . some [, _i] think_ they more [of] their parts plastic , which [, you know ,] makes [things] break easier [, but] _i think_ [the] technology [is] better . 
B|38| M: ayea 
A|39| A: [about] quality . 
B|40| M: ohh , why [you] . 
A|41| A: right . 
B|42| M: [yeah] [but] i'm [, you know ,] [the] [one] [that's] being made 
A|43| A: [yeah ,] [yeah .] 
B|44| M: [do] [you] ? 
A|45| A: right . well , people aren't willing [to] pay those prices [very] often [, so] [, you know ,] [for a] handcrafted something [, so]
