B|45| M: _it's a_ shame [they don't] [see] [it] [that] way . 
A|46| A: [you know ,] um [, [i] [,] i think] [nursing] homes [are] , [are] , um , [some] [are] _good_

A|48| A: _i [have_ to] say [that] . 
B|49| M: [uh] ... i've been [to] [places .] 
A|50| A: [but] for [the] most part [i] truly believe _that the_ parents _would be_ better if [they] were [with the] children . 
B|51| M: [yes] _, [but_ they] do . 
A|52| A: um , 
B|53| M: do [you] want [to] [see] [a] kid [with] [a] mom ? 
A|54| A: [right] [, right] .

B|57| M: [i think] _you're_ [in the] wrong state , op .

A|60| A: [you know ,] [it's] [, _i think] it's_ very difficult [in the] first [place] [to] make [that] choice _to have_ [them] _go_ there . 
B|61| M: why do [you] [think] [so] ? 
A|62| A: _and then_ if [you] find _out_ [that] [they] [are] [not] having [good] care , [you know ,] [i'm] sure [that] [it] [is] _just_ , [you know ,] you'd pull [them] _out_ [of] there [so] fast . 
B|63| M: [yeah [,] that's] what [i was] thinking . 
A|64| A: [and] [, uh ,] [and] yet if [you] didn't feel like [you] could _be _a_ good_ _caretaker_ _i don't_ [, uh ,] [it's a] very , very [hard] decision [i think] . 
B|65| M: _i know_ 
A|66| A: uh-huh . [i think that's] [right] , 
B|67| M: [i think] _you're_ 
A|68| A: [and] especially if [you're] _not a_ person [that] [is] like [a] [medical] person maybe or something [that the] person needs [medical] treatment . 
B|69| M: [i think it's] possible _, but_ [it's] [not [a] good] [idea] [to be a] medic [and] [a caretaker] . 
A|70| A: now [i know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] [father] [, uh ,] she brought [to] her [home] [, uh ,] [to] live there [, but] [he] needed [the] [medical] treatment [and] she had [a nursing] person come [in] like three times [a] week [to] , [to] help him _out_ . 
B|71| M: [he] [can] get [a good] doctor . 
A|72| A: [and] [that] might [be a] partial solution , or something . 
B|73| M: [i think it's] [just] an excuse [to _have] a_ baby . 
A|74| A: [but] , um [, i] personally am for [the] _trying it_ [at] [home] [caretaker] part before [i think] i'd ever , 
B|75| M: [the] problem [is] [that] [they're] probably [not] [trying it] [out] [in] [a] [home] . 
A|76| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [and then] ? 
A|78| A: [well [,] [i] [,] i think] we kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|79| M: [i don't] [think] [so .]
