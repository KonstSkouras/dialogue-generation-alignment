A|10| A: [uh [i] uh] [some] nights his mother calls me _and_ says _can_ your family _and_ _just_ bring [the] kids [in the] family _and_ _just_ come over _and_ _and_ visit grandma because she gets very disoriented . 
B|11| M: [i] can't .

B|21| M: [you know] there's [a] _place_ [in] kansas _that_ [has] _a nursing_ _home_ . 
A|22| A: _yes_ . 
B|23| M: _it's a_ tragedy . 
A|24| A: [uh _i think] it's_ wonderful these these _places_ [that] aren't [nursing] homes necessarily _but they_ _can_ _go_ _and_ reside there like little apartments _places_ [in] between _places ._ 
B|25| M: [uh] how do [you know] [that] ? 
A|26| A: _and_ [i] like [that] _idea_ if _they_ _can_ handle _it_ themselves . um 
B|27| M: [and so i] said [to] [them] 
A|28| A: _yeah yeah_ 
B|29| M: [oh] [yeah [yeah] .] 
A|30| A: [yeah .] 
B|31| M: _are_ [you] [uh] interested [in] any _of_ this ? 
A|32| A: uh-huh . 
B|33| M: what's up ? 
A|34| A: [yeah .] 
B|35| M: [you] okay ? 
A|36| A: [nursing] homes . 
B|37| M: what do [you] mean ? 
A|38| A: visit . 
B|39| M: how much _would_ [it] cost ? 
A|40| A: uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [it's] [not] [that] [hard] . 
A|42| A: _they don't_ _go_ [and] _see them_ _. that's_ [right] . 
B|43| M:  ... [that's] [not] true [at] all . 
A|44| A: [that's] [right] . 
B|45| M: _it's a_ shame [they don't] [see] [it] [that] way . 
A|46| A: [you know] um [i] [i think] [nursing] homes [are] [are] um [some] [are] _good_ 
B|47| M: [i think that's] what [they] meant by'people ' . 
A|48| A: _i [have_ to] say [that] . 
B|49| M: [uh] ... i've been [to] [places .] 
A|50| A: [but] for [the] most part [i] truly believe _that the_ parents _would be_ better if [they] were [with the] children . 
B|51| M: [yes] [but they] do . 
A|52| A: um 
B|53| M: do [you] want [to] [see] [a] kid [with] [a] mom ? 
A|54| A: [right] [right] . 
B|55| M: _i'm_ saying [that the] real people [in the] world [would be] able [to] [see them] all [day .] 
A|56| A: uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [i think] _you're_ [in the] wrong state op . 
A|58| A: [i] hope _so ._ 
B|59| M: hopefully [so [.] that's] [good] . [but] . [so .] [bad] . [but] . 
A|60| A: [you know] [it's] _i think it's_ very difficult [in the] first [place] [to] make [that] choice _to have_ [them] _go_ there . 
B|61| M: why do [you] [think] [so] ? 
A|62| A: _and then_ if [you] find _out_ [that] [they] [are] [not] having [good] care [you know] [i'm] sure [that] [it] [is] _just_ [you know] you'd pull [them] _out_ [of] there [so] fast . 
B|63| M: [yeah] [that's] what [i was] thinking . 
A|64| A: [and] [uh] [and] yet if [you] didn't feel like [you] could _be _a_ good_ _caretaker_ _i don't_ [uh] [it's a] very very [hard] decision [i think] . 
B|65| M: _i know_ 
A|66| A: uh-huh . [i think that's] [right] 
B|67| M: [i think] _you're_ 
A|68| A: [and] especially if [you're] _not a_ person [that] [is] like [a] [medical] person maybe or something [that the] person needs [medical] treatment . 
B|69| M: [i think it's] possible [but] [it's] [not [a] good] [idea] [to be a] medic [and] [a caretaker] . 
A|70| A: now [i know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] [father] [uh] she brought [to] her [home] [uh] [to] live there [but] [he] needed [the] [medical] treatment [and] she had [a nursing] person come [in] like three times [a] week [to] [to] help him _out_ . 
B|71| M: [he] [can] get [a good] doctor . 
A|72| A: [and] [that] might [be a] partial solution or something . 
B|73| M: [i think it's] [just] an excuse [to _have] a_ baby . 
A|74| A: [but] um [i] personally am for [the] _trying it_ [at] [home] [caretaker] part before [i think] i'd ever 
B|75| M: [the] problem [is] [that] [they're] probably [not] [trying it] [out] [in] [a] [home] . 
A|76| A: [yeah .] [yeah .] 
B|77| M: [and then] ? 
A|78| A: [well] [i] [i think] we kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|79| M: [i don't] [think] [so .] 
A|80| A: [good] [to] hear from [you] . 
B|81| M: [i _have] [a_ lot] [of] stuff [to] do [. [it's] a] bit busy .
