B|2| M: _you_ _are_ _not_ disciplined . 
A|3| A: _you know ,_ [you] _just_ , [you] did [not] see _, i_ did [not] see anybody _in_ my classrooms , when _i was_ [going to school] , act up [the] way _that_ [kids] _do_ these days _in the_ classroom . 
B|4| M: _i'm_ [not] _a_ child , _i'm_ _a_ human being . 
A|5| A: _yeah _,_ _that's_ right_ _, _that's_ right ._ 
B|6| M: _i [know_ [,] that's] why [i] said [i _was] _a_ little bit_ scared . 
A|7| A: my , my daughter's _in the_ _, um ,_ fourth grade 
B|8| M: _it's_ _a_ girl 
A|9| A: _and _,_ um ,_ there's children _in_ her classroom _that_ _just_ totally disrupt [the] classroom , where _the teacher_ cannot teach 
B|10| M: uhhh _, [and_ _,] uh ,_ [teacher] , who's [the teacher] ?

B|12| M: uhhh _, uh [,_ um _,] yeah _,_ uh_ ... 
A|13| A: uh-huh . well , _they_ , _they_ _just_ _don't_ _do_ _that_ any more . 
B|14| M: [i was] told _that they_ _are_ _, uh ,_ _the teachers_ . 
A|15| A: but [the] [school] system's afraid [of] getting sued [and [,] um ,] all sorts [of] lawsuits [i'm] sure because [of] things like [that] . 
B|16| M: _we_ _are_ . 
A|17| A: [and _,] i_ also believe _we don't ,_ even though [i] feel like [i] pay [a] good share towards [the] [school] system , _that [the_ teachers] [are] still underpaid [and] [we] still _don't_ _have_ enough money towards put _in_ toward public [school] . 
B|18| M: [we don't [,] that's] why . 
A|19| A: [and [,] um _,] i_ _think_ [that] if [we] had enough money [and] paid [the teachers] [a little bit] more , [that] maybe [that] could solve some [of] our problems . 
B|20| M: _it's_ [a] joke 
A|21| A: yes supposedly [that's] _what_ [it's] suppose [to] go for [, and] _you know ,_ we'll _just_ _have_ [to] wait [and] see whether [that's] approved or [not] . 
B|22| M:  ... 
A|23| A: _you know _,_ i_ [don't] [know] your feelings toward [that] _. i_ guess [we] shouldn't get into [that] but [, um [,] and] _what_ else [, um _,] i_ _think_ _in_ some ways [that they] need [to] be more careful [of] [the teachers] [that they] hire . 
B|24| M: [it's] 
A|25| A: _i have_ heard stories [, uh ,] from other [parents] [that] [i know] [of] , their children [are] _in_ _high school_ [that] [teachers] [are] out there giving drugs [and] selling drugs , 
B|26| M: [what] 
A|27| A: oh [, yeah ,] 
B|28| M: [that's right .] 
A|29| A: i've , i've heard some horrible , horrible stories about _high_ , _high school_ [teachers] 
B|30| M: [i'm] sorry . 
A|31| A: [and ,] _you know ,_ [to] be , be more careful [of] [the teachers] [that] [we] place _in_ our [school] . 
B|32| M: [that's] why [i] keep [a] [high school] teacher's number . 
A|33| A: [um [,] that's] basically about all [that] [i know] [that] may be wrong with [the] [school] system _. i_ _think_ , with [what] [they] _have_ [to] work with _, i_ _think_ they're doing [a] pretty good job [right] now . 
B|34| M:  ... [um] ... [um] ... [you know [,] um] ... 
A|35| A: uh-huh , _so ._ 
B|36| M: [so .] [what] [do] [you] [think] ? 
A|37| A: [yeah ,] okay , [so] this is probably [a] real hard _subject_ for [you] . 
B|38| M: [i] am [not] really interested [in the] [subject] matter . 
A|39| A: [yeah] . okay , well _, i_ guess [, um ,] [we] can discontinue our call now . 
B|40| M: [i'm] sorry 
A|41| A: it [was a] joy [in] talking with [you] . 
B|42| M: [i'm] fine . 
A|43| A: okay , thanks . 
B|44| M: sorry [. i] [just] wanted [to] say [, [i] have] [a] feeling [that the] others [are] [the] same as me .
