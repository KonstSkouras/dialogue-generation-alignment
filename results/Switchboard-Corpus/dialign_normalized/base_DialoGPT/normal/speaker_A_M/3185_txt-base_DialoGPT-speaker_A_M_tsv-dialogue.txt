A|29| A: [well i] agree absolutely _and_ [you know] [it's] all relative _because_ [i] was [from] west texas _and_ [it] was very dry _and_ [so] [i] thought dallas was awful _and_ [i] still [think so] [but] then this _summer_ we went [to] orlando _for a_ week _and_ [it] was [so] _humid_ [there] [that] your um all your windows were were wet every morning . they had [to] get [the] squeejies _and_ clean them off . 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: _and_ when we got back [to] dallas [it] seemed really dry _because_ [it's] kind [of] [like] [what] [you're] [used [to] .] [but i] agree with [you] [the] humidity especially [for] curly heads [like] me .

B|38| M: [i think] [it's] [because] they're sooo cute 
A|39| A: [but] [it] seems [like] _here_ [i] [would] _like it_ [to] [rain] [and] then [be] over [and] then [not] [rain] _for a while_ [. it] seems [like] when [it] gets stuck _in_ [a] [rain] pattern that's all [it] does .

A|41| A: [so] uh [but i] _i am_ [ready _for] a_ little bit [of] [the] cooler [weather] [and] [not] [so] much _in the_ nineties [but] something [like] 
B|42| M: [well [i] am] [going to be] [out] [of] town [for a] few _days_ . 
A|43| A: [i] guess _my_ _my_ best [would be] probably sixty-eight when [you] wake up or sixty-six [and] then probably seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|44| M: [what] _do you_ mean [you] [think] [it's] [not] _a good_ [time] 
A|45| A: _yeah . yeah_ are [you] _do you [like_ the] heat _in the_ _summer_ then when [it] gets up _in the_ nineties [and] hundreds .
