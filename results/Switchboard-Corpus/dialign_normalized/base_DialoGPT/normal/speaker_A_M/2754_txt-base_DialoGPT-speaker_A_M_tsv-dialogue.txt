[i'm not] even _sure_ [of] [that] [but] _for_ _some_ reason [i think] [that] _you know_ [it] _was_ something [like] _that ._ [and] [it] surprised [and] even [florida] [i _know] [they_ have] [it] [and] [you] [don't] _really_ hear [about] [it] real often _how many_ people 
B|30| M:  ... 
A|31| A: _yeah_ [but] [you] [you] [think] [that] _i mean_ _if_ [you] [think] [of] _how many_ premeditated murders _are_ committed _you know_ compared _to_ _that and_ _to_ _how many_ people _are_ [being] sent [that] _doesn't_ seem [like] very _many_ . 
B|32| M: [that and] 
A|33| A: _yeah ._ 
B|34| M: [that .] 
A|35| A: everyone _would_ _appeal ._ [that's] true too . 
B|36| M: except [you know] [the] [uh] appeals 
A|37| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [i think] [it would be] [a] good idea [to] [have] [the] supreme courts review [the cases] _of the_ supreme courts [and] [the] supreme court [of] appeals . 
A|39| A: uh-huh _. yeah ._ 
B|40| M: [not] [really] [the] supreme court [doesn't] [appeal] [the] [appeal .] 
A|41| A: _yeah_ uh-huh . 
B|42| M: um um um ... 
A|43| A: [and] then _they _get out_ ._ 
B|44| M: [the first] thing [i] thought [of] [was] [that they] [are] _in the_ middle [of] [a] street . 
A|45| A: _yeah_ _they get out_ [in] _three years_ on probation 
B|46| M: [i] wonder [how many] [of them] [are] _going to_ _be in jail_ [for] [the] next [three years] . 
A|47| A: [and] [they] _do it_ again [you know] . 
B|48| M: [they get out] 
A|49| A: [it's] [like] [a] slap on [the] fingers _for them ._ 
B|50| M: why ? 
A|51| A: [i don't] [i don't] [i don't] [i think] [that] [it] should [be] _i mean_ _if_ [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] someone did premeditate someone [a] murder then [i think] [you know] [that they] should likewise [you know] someone should take their life also . [but] [uh] [but] [are] [are] [you] [would] [you] draw [the] line there with just [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: _yeah ._

A|55| A: uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [i'm] sorry [i'm] sorry . 
A|57| A: _yeah ._ 
B|58| M: [well] [it's] [a] lot easier [to] [get] [in] prison _than_ [it] [is] [to] [get out .] 
A|59| A: uh-huh _. yeah ._ 
B|60| M: yea [. yeah .] 
A|61| A: [i think] _some [of_ them] [would] rather [be in jail] 
B|62| M: [so] [you're] [saying] [that] [some _of] the_ guys [in] prison [are] [like] [the] inmates ? 
A|63| A: [yeah .] _they probably_ [have] [it] better [in jail] [than] [what] [they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: [you know [they] probably] [don't] _have a_ lot [of] _money_ . 
A|65| A: [i don't] [know] [uh] [i] [was] just [going to] [say] something [i] forgot [what] [it] [was] . [oh] [i don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] now .

B|70| M: [yeah] [i'm not] [really] [sure] [what] [that] means . 
A|71| A: uh-huh . see [yeah] okay [well] see [i'm] [i'm] [in] kind [i'm] [in] kind okay [uh] _we_ only [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|72| M: [i] er [say] mostly 
A|73| A: [yeah] [and] [that] [would be] pushing _it ._ [so] _i mean_ this [is] definitely [a] college town . [uh] we're [about] two hours north [of] pittsburgh _if_ [that] [would] help [you] [out] any . [uh]

B|88| M: hehehe [yeah .] 
A|89| A: [yeah .] [you know] [i think] people [can] [be] persuaded one way [or] another . [i've] never seriously ran into someone [i mean] [like] other [than] my priest [you know] who definitely says [you] can't take [a] [you know] [you] can't take anyone's life . [uh] anyone [that] [is] [like] [so] against [it] [that] [you] couldn't persuade [them] [in] any instance .

B|98| M:  ... 
A|99| A: [so] [i don't think] [that they] deserve [anything] _less_ 
B|100| M: [well] [they don't] [have a] lot [less] [than] [they [have] a] ton [of] [they're] [a] ton's [a] ton [a] ton

A|105| A: uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [i'm not sure] [if you're] [saying] [we] [can] [do [it] but] [we] [can]
