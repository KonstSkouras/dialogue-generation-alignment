B|48| M: [they get out]

A|57| A: _yeah ._ 
B|58| M: [well [,] it's] [a] lot easier [to] [get] [in] prison _than_ [it] [is] [to] [get out .] 
A|59| A: uh-huh _. yeah ._ 
B|60| M: yea [. yeah .] 
A|61| A: [i think] _some [of_ them] [would] rather [be in jail] 
B|62| M: [so] [you're] [saying] [that] [some _of] the_ guys [in] prison [are] [like] [the] inmates ? 
A|63| A: [yeah .] _they probably_ [have] [it] better [in jail] [than] [what] [they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: [you know , [they] probably] [don't] _have a_ lot [of] _money_ . 
A|65| A: [i don't] [know [,] uh _,] i_ [was] just [going to] [say] something _, i_ forgot [what] [it] [was] . [oh _,] [i_ don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] now .

B|72| M: [i ,] er , _say ,_ mostly , 
A|73| A: [yeah [,] and] [that] [would be] pushing _it ._ [so] _, _i_ mean_ this [is] definitely [a] college town . [uh ,] we're [about] two hours north [of] pittsburgh _if_ [that] [would] help [you] [out] any . [uh ,]

B|88| M: hehehe [, yeah .] 
A|89| A: [yeah .] [you know [,] [i] think] people [can] [be] persuaded one way [or] another . [i've] never seriously ran into someone [, [i] mean] [like] , other [than] my priest [, you know ,] who definitely says [you] can't take [a] [, you know [,] you] can't take anyone's life .

B|98| M:  ... 
A|99| A: [so] [i don't think] [that they] deserve [anything] _less_ 
B|100| M: [well [,] [they] don't] [have a] lot [less] [than] [they [have] a] ton [of] [, they're] [a] ton's [a] ton [, a] ton

B|104| M: [they're] [not] getting [anything] [for them .] 
A|105| A: uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [i'm not sure] [if you're] [saying] [we] [can] [do [it] , but] [we] [can]
