B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: _so he_ gets _a_ break two days _a_ week _but_ it's _only_ _for_ like two or three hours at _a_ time . 
B|6| M: _i'm_ [so he] ... 
A|7| A: _and_ , _you know_ , just , _you_ see _a_ lot of things like _you_ , _you know_ , was _a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play _golf_ when [he] retired _, and_ _you know_ _that a_ lot of _the_ things [he] thought [he] would do when [he] retired _he's_ _not_ able _to_ do now . 
B|8| M: [you know] 
A|9| A: _but_ [he] refuses _to consider_ _any_ other , _i don't_ ,

A|11| A: yeah _, and_ is _that_ how your parents feel or ,

A|17| A: [i know] at _this_ , [i know] [i] feel like [i] would never do [that] with my parents either , [you [know] .] _but_ _i ,_ [i] [really] feel bad _for_ _the_ _people_ [i] see [not] very , [i'm not] _really ,_ [really] experienced _but_ like [i] said [i] just _have_ [that] one family _, and_ [i] just [really] feel bad _for_ _the_ guy _who_ his whole life is different now _and_ , than [he] thought it would be . _but ,_ 
B|18| M: [you] 
A|19| A: yeah _, and_ [he's] got , [you know] , seven brothers _and_ sisters _and_ _, and_ , uh , [he's] _the_ one because [he's] _the_ one [that] isn't [going to] work every day _and_ [that] she moved _in_ with when she needed [to] move _in_ with someone . _and_ , 
B|20| M: [i] 
A|21| A: oh , well , [that's] great . 
B|22| M: [i ,] 
A|23| A: [that's] [a] good idea . we ought [to] , yeah _, and_ maybe when _the_ other brothers _and_ sisters retire or whatever , [i don't] [know] [what] they're [going to] do . it's [really] [not] my family . it's my fiancee's [so] [i don't] , [i] can't say much . 
B|24| M: [you] 
A|25| A: _but_ [i] always feel like [i] would never put my parents _in_ either _and_ [i] wonder , [i'm] [going to] be _the only_ sibling [that] isn't [going to] _have_ children [so] if my parents do need [to] live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers _and_ sisters will be having teenagers around _and_ everything [to] _care_ _for_ . [you know] , 
B|26| M: yay 
A|27| A: _and_ [i'm] , [i ,] [that's] fine with me . my fiancee _and_ [i] both figure [that's] what's , we're [going to] end up with both of _the_ parents or whoever . if [you know] [what] [i] mean ? we feel like , it's our responsibility , 
B|28| M: [i [,] and] 
A|29| A: [and] [i] feel like [i] would never put them _in_ [a] home . _but_ [i] wonder how much , [you know] , if one of us is [going to] _have_ [to] quit work someday or retire early or something . 
B|30| M: [i'm not] . 
A|31| A: [you] [think] about it [and] it's _really ,_ [i don't] [know .] _this country_ kind of takes _the_ worst _care_ of _the_ elderly of [any] other _country_ . 
B|32| M: [i don't] [really ,] [don't] 
A|33| A: [and] , it's [really] more of [a] , um , like [a] respect issue [that] _the_ older , older _people_ _in_ other countries [that] i've _been_ [to] seem [to] [really] _have_ [a] lot more respect _for_ _the_ elderly _people_ [and] [, and] _they_ [really] seem as wise [and] [, and] _in this country_ nobody [really ,] yeah , nobody [really] pays attention 
B|34| M:  
A|35| A: [and] _they_ , oh , _the_ old-timer made with _the_ old way [and] nobody respects _the_ traditions . [and] , [you know] , it's [i ,] [i'm not] [saying] [that] [i] do either _but_ [you know] , it's just funny 
B|36| M: [so] , [but ,] 
A|37| A: [and] [, and] we [really] [don't] _have_ [any] [that] [don't] _have_ _the_ _social_ security [and] everything [really] isn't [that] much _for_ elderly _people_ [to] live on . 
B|38| M: [social] welfare 
A|39| A: [you know] , even if they're _in_ good _health_ it's incredible . 
B|40| M: [what] ?! no . 
A|41| A: _they_ [don't] _have_ [any] _, they_ [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe _they_ should , [you know] because we're all [going to] get old someday . 
B|42| M: [the only] [people] [that] [have] ever gotten [health] [care] [in this country] [are] [the] ones [who] [have] [been] living [in this] city [for] generations . 
A|43| A: [and] [so] it's [a] , it's kind of [a] depressing topic though . how old [are] [you] ? 
B|44| M: yes [, they] [are] . 
A|45| A: [so] it is , yeah [, and] it must be rough [for] [you] too [to] see your grandmother .
