A|17| A: huh . 
B|18| M: [she] _was_ [a] nurse [and] nurse practitioner . 
A|19| A: [yeah _i] think_ that _is_ an excellent program [i] _really_ _do_ _. _i_ like_ that . [and] [it's] [it's] beneficial _to_ _the_ small towns too _because_ _they_ _really_ _really_ have have [a] disadvantage that _we_ wouldn't _understand_ _because_ we're _in the_ metroplex . 
B|20| M:

A|31| A: [i] want _to_ believe _they_ _go_ into other countries [and] teach them how _to do_ things _like_ farm uh dig their own wells set up their schools . 
B|32| M: [it] [is] 
A|33| A: yes . _they_ 
B|34| M: [do] [they] ? 
A|35| A: [it's [not] a] program _to_ teach them _to_ use _the_ american [money] [it's a] program _to_ teach them _to be_ _more_ self-reliant . 
B|36| M: [i don't] [understand] _what_ [you] mean . 
A|37| A: [and] yes you're right _i think_ [it's a] sixties program _. i think_ [it was] one [of] kennedy's hot points that he that [was] his big deal . 
B|38| M: [i'm] [not] sure _what_ [you] mean . 
A|39| A: right . right . um _i think_ [i] i've singled out _my_ grandchildren [and] _but_ actually _they're_ _they're_ _pretty good_ along those lines as compared _to_ [what i] have seen [from] other people's children [and] grandchildren mine aren't _really_ that bad 
B|40| M: [i] 
A|41| A: _but_ at _the_ same time _i think_ [it] _would_ [do] them [a] world [of] [good .] 
B|42| M: [i like] 
A|43| A: _but_ there's [a] 
B|44| M: [it's a] [pretty good] game [i think] 
A|45| A: mandatory _just_ [like] [like] _the_ _draft_ . no . 
B|46| M: mandate everyone [to do] [a] [draft] ? 
A|47| A: every time [you] _they could_ buy their way out . 
B|48| M: [they could] [just] [be] paid [a] minimum wage [of] 250000 [a] [year] . 
A|49| A: right [you] [know] [they] they'd figure [a] way around that one [in] [a] heartbeat . _but_ [i'm] wondering [if] there's another issue here [and] maybe this [is] why this has died out . _can _you_ go_ into [and] this wasn't _the_ question _but_ [it's] [it] may [be] _the_ _more of_ _the_ issue versus _should_ young adults _can_ [they] _go_ [in] there [and] _can_ anyone _go_ into [well] out [of] _the_ kurdish community [is] [a little] bit extreme at this time _but_ say [i think] bangladesh _would_ have been [a] [good] example [or] some some _really_ desperate situation [and] teach them [to] farm [and] teach them [and] [it] doesn't [do] any [good .] 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: _i don't know_ that [it] does _. i_ _i don't know_ that um [if] [you] step _back_ [from] _the_ current issue [and] look at [it] _more_ intellectually there _are_ forever over as long as _we_ [know] there _are_ races [of] _people_ that _are_ dropping out . 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: [you] [know] we're losing certain races [of] _people_ . 
B|54| M: _it ._ 
A|55| A: there _are_ _people_ now that _are_ obsolete point [and] fact [just] [just] [like] endangered species [of] animals _so_ there _are_ quote tribes [of] _people_ that _are_ endangered [or] obsolete . 
B|56| M: [what] [are] [you] [a] historian ? 
A|57| A: [and] [i'm] [just] wondering [if] you're fighting [a] natural process there [of] being winnowed out . there's [a] german word [for] [it] [that's] elegant _but_ [i] never _can_ remember [what] [it was] uh _but_ _but_ that _they're_ _they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ where _they are_ _they're not_ adapted [to] their environment essentially . 
B|58| M:  
A|59| A: um [and] one [of] _the_ quick examples [is] _the_ aborigines . 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: uh when _we_ were [in] australia uh sad [little] things . uh [i] felt _sorry_ [for] them . _because_ their society isn't there anymore [and] their belief system [and] all their structured [of] theirs all _the_ structures [of] their society [are] gone essentially . 
B|62| M: [they're] 
A|63| A: [and] [they're] [just] kind [of] _more_ [like] _a side_ show than anything else [and] [that's] sad . 
B|64| M: [they're not] [really [a] side] shows [they're] [more of] [a] cult . 
A|65| A: _but_ [i don't] [think] there's any way [you] [could] _go_ uh _the peace corps_ [could] _go_ [in] [and] rescue those _people_ [and] [i don't] [think] [you] [could] have done [it] fifty [or] [a] hundred years ago either . 
B|66| M: [i'm] [sorry] . 
A|67| A: _so_ [i] [i'm] wondering [if] _the peace corps_ [is] [really] an effective tool . 
B|68| M: [i don't know] [. i think] [they] [would] [be] . 
A|69| A: [good] point . we've [got] enough without without [a] passport there's [plenty] . 
B|70| M: [can you] get 
A|71| A: yes [. _i think] we_ ought [to] worry _about_ our own species . 
B|72| M: [i think _we] should be_ worried [about the] [people] who [are] [in the] military . 
A|73| A: [i] wonder now [in] [and] i've been out [of] school too long [to] answer this _but_ [i] wonder [if] there aren't some sociology courses . 
B|74| M: social studies 
A|75| A: [that's] [the] last thing [you] want [to do] . 
B|76| M: [you] 
A|77| A: [yeah] [that's] exactly [it .] 
B|78| M: [i] 
A|79| A: [they're not] _going to_ take that [money] [you] _give_ them [and] _go_ try [to] figure out [a] way [to] dry out with [it .] now come _on_ let's [be] realistic 
B|80| M: [it's] [like] [but] [you go] 
A|81| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|82| M: [the] only reason [i'm] even considering [it] [is] [because] [i'm] trying [to] get [my] parents [to] [give] me [a] loan . 
A|83| A: right . 
B|84| M: [you] can't [go] [back] [to] [work] . 
A|85| A: no we're [not] [i don't] [think] [. i think] [that's] [more] realistic than making them [go] [in _the] peace corps_ . 
B|86| M: [so] [do] [you] [think] [they are] [going [to] be] [on] [the peace corps] ? 
A|87| A: [i think] [that's] [a] lot [more] realistic . uh [i] [i think] that [we should be] spending [more] time [and] [and] again [i don't] [think] [the] [the peace corps] [is] [is] as successful now simply [because] [it's not .] [it] doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|88| M: [that's] [not] true . 
A|89| A: uh we've [got plenty] [in] fact we've [got] far too many . you're [in] uh [what] flower mound ? 
B|90| M: n 
A|91| A: [i] [was] [that's] exactly [what i] [was] [going to] ask [you] . have [you] ever have have [you] been downtown
