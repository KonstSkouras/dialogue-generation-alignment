B|0| M: _i think_ _they're_ saying _it's_ not _too_ late _to_ get _back_ _to_ work . 
A|1| A: uh-huh . 
B|2| M: yea _. uh_ _. uh_ . 
A|3| A: uh-huh . 
B|4| M: _you_ _have_ _a good_ point _. i_ wonder what _the_ _other _people_ are_ _like_ . 
A|5| A: _you know_ [i] [i] _really_ agree _with_ [you] . _um _i_ uh_ though _i've_ never done _that_ myself [i] _i'm_ _was_ [a] basically an education major when [i] graduated _from_ _college_ _and_ [i] accepted [a] job _that_ at [the] _time_ _was_ _just_ slightly above [the] _poverty_ level [to] teach [to] _um_ very rural children _in_ [a] very low income district _and_ [i] spent [a] year teaching _there_ 
B|6| M: [i] 
A|7| A: _and_ [i think] _it_ _was_ probably one _of_ my largest eye-opening experiences _because_ [i] come _from_ nice middle class white suburban home 
B|8| M: _i know_ . 
A|9| A: _and_ [i] did _it_ _um_ _for_ one reason [i] wanted _i was_ working on [a] masters degree _so_ [i] wanted [to] stay close [to] where _i was_ working on [a] masters degree _but_ also _because_ [i] _just_ thought _that_ _it_ _would be_ _interesting_ [to] live _some_ place else _so_ totally different _than_ my _own_ up bringing 
B|10| M:  ... 
A|11| A: _and_ [i] _it_ changed _it_ probably changed my political views _it_ changed my understanding _of the world_ _around_ me 
B|12| M: _i think _you_ should_ visit [some] places . 
A|13| A: _and_ [i think] _um_ _in_ fact _if_ [i] had [to] _do_ _it_ all again [i] _you know_ after _that_ _you know_ [you] never [think] _of_ _it_ _because_ _i guess_ _because_ [i] paid _for_ all _of_ my _college_ education myself [i] never thought _about_ doing _that_ _because_ [i] had all these _college_ loans i'd started paying [back] . 
B|14| M: uhh . 
A|15| A: _um_ _so_ _that_ _was_ _that_ _was_ one reason _why_ [i] never considered _it_ _but_ now _that_ _i'm_ further along _and_ _i'm_ _still_ paying these _college_ loans [i] [i think] realistically _you know_ _you can_ [have] _your_ _college_ loans delayed now _because_ [i] had _them_ delayed _because_ _i'm_ [back] _in_ graduate _school_ at thirty years old 
B|16| M: [i] 
A|17| A: _um i_ had _them_ delayed _because_ _i'm_ [back] _in_ graduate _school_ _and_ on _that_ form _it_ says _if_ _your_ joining [the] peace corps _you can_ [have] _them_ delayed 
B|18| M: [i] [have] [time] 
A|19| A: _and_ [i] thought _that_ _was_ _you know_ very _interesting_ _and_ [i] [i] _would_ [have] thought _of_ _that_ earlier [i] probably _would_ [have] done _you know_ _just_ [like] _is_ _that_ _is_ this _is_ _that the_ mormon church _that_ does _that_ ? 
B|20| M: yes [of] course 
A|21| A: _because_ one [of] my neighbors [uh] did _that_ _in_ pittsburgh _from_ pittsburgh . 
B|22| M: [i uh] _i think _i_ know_ what [you] mean . 
A|23| A: _and_ [i] thought _you know_ _that_ _really_ now _that_ _i'm_ thirty years old [i think] _that_ one or two years _out_ [of] my life _would_ [have] probably [like] [you] said _to be_ able [to] travel [some] place else whether _it_ _be the_ united states or outside [the] _country_ [i think] _it_ _would_ _have been_ [a] very [good] _um_ experience _for_ me . 
B|24| M: us . 
A|25| A: uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [i'm] not [really] [i'm] 
A|27| A: uh-huh . 
B|28| M:  ... _how_ [about] 
A|29| A: uh-huh . _yeah ._ _and_ [i think _you] know_ _we_ [have] such [a] need now _you know_ [i] taught _you know_ [i] [i think _i] was_ paid [uh] [about] nine thousand dollars [to] teach _for_ [the] year 
B|30| M: [i'm] [so] 
A|31| A: _and_ [i] worked _in_ [a] very rural _school_ district _and_ [i] [i] one _of the_ _things_ [i] taught _was_ [a] computer class 
B|32| M: uuhuh 
A|33| A: _and_ these kids _um_ _you know_ every _girl_ [i] taught except _for_ one _was_ pregnant . 
B|34| M: [i uh] [uh] 
A|35| A: _many_ _of the_ boys _in the_ room had children _and_ _they were_ _they were_ _high school_ juniors . 
B|36| M: [i'm] not [a] child [i'm] [a] [high school] junior . 
A|37| A: _and_ [i] _just_ _there_ _you know_ _they_ came _from_ _poverty_ _they were_ going [to] condition _in_ _poverty_ _and_ _it_ _was_ _it_ _was_ [the] [school] district couldn't hire _many people_ _it_ _was_ very difficult _for them_ [to] hire _and_ [i think _you] know_ _in the_ sense _that_ aspect [of] public service _for_ education _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _for_ _um_ _just_ social workers _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _and_ _some _of_ the_ rural areas where _they_ _just_ need advice on medical _um_ _things_ [i think] [it's] [a] [really] [good] idea . _and_ even _if_ _it is_ overseas . 
B|38| M:  
A|39| A: _see_ [i] never [i] [i] tell [you] sometimes [i] worry [about] _things_ over seas _because_ _we_ [have] such problems _right_ here _in_ our _own_ _country_ . 
B|40| M: [i'm] 
A|41| A: uh-huh . 
B|42| M: [i'm] . [of] . 
A|43| A: _yeah ._ uh-huh . _yeah ._ 
B|44| M: [i'm] [from] [the] uk . 
A|45| A: _right ._ uh-huh . 
B|46| M: [and] [it's] [still] not _the most_ popular [country] [in [the] world] . 
A|47| A: uh-huh . 
B|48| M: uhh [um] . yes . 
A|49| A: uh-huh . 
B|50| M: [because] [they] _are_ better [than] [the] _other_ _students_ . 
A|51| A: _yeah [._ [i] think] _it_ _would_ also help _them_ _if they_ _then_ went on [to] _college_ [. [i] know] _that_ my first couple [of] years [of] _college_ _were_ [um] [uh] probably [too] carefree at [the] beginning 
B|52| M: what [if they] [have been] [in] [college] [for] [a] while ? 
A|53| A: _and then_ at [the] end [i] had _to be_ _too serious ._ 
B|54| M: uhh [i think] [they were] [just] [a] bit [too serious .] 
A|55| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [and then] [you] get [to be] [a] little [girl] [and] get [to] hang [out] [with] [them] . 
A|57| A: _yeah_ _that's_ true . 
B|58| M: [that's] [why] [you] [have] [to] take [a] vow [of] [poverty] . 
A|59| A: uh-huh [that's] _right ._ 
B|60| M: [they] [do] _a lot of_ [things] _that _we_ don't_ . 
A|61| A: [i] _yeah [i_ think [i] think] this _was_ this _was_ [a] very _interesting_ topic [uh] [because] [it's] something [that] _you know_ [we don't] talk [about] [in] this [country] probably enough . 
B|62| M: _oh_ _well_ [yeah [i] guess] _that's interesting_ 
A|63| A: [uh] _you know_ 
B|64| M: no [i] [don't] [know] . 
A|65| A: uh-huh . [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|66| M: _because of the_ freedom [of] choices [i guess] . 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| M: uuhh _that's uh_ weird . 
A|69| A: _oh [i_ think] _it is ._ 
B|70| M: no [it's] not . 
A|71| A: [i] [really] [think [i] think] [um] [people] [you should] [i] _you know_ [the] kids today [i] teach [i] spend [a lot of] my [time] teaching [college] [students] 
B|72| M: [i think] you're wrong [i'm] [right .] 
A|73| A: [and] _um _i_ find great_ disgust _in _them_ in their _in_ their_ [um] _their_ self-centeredness [and] _their_ inability [to] _understand_ [um] multicultural or multiracial situation 
B|74| M: [i find great] disdain [for [them] in their [in] the] self centeredness [in them] self centered [in] themselves . 
A|75| A: [and] [i] [really] _you know_ [they] [don't] _understand_ [uh] [how] [other people] live [um] [they] [don't] _understand_ 
B|76| M: [you know] what you're [right .] 
A|77| A: uh-huh . [yeah [i] think] [that's uh] [just] having [a good] [time] . 
B|78| M: [i know] [but] [uh] [i'm] [uh] [uh] [um i] [don't] [really] [understand] 
A|79| A: [i uh] [a] friend [of] mine _is a_ psychologist [and] he always refers [to] _it_ _as_ short-term pleasure oriented [. [i] guess] he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] _it_ [you know] 
B|80| M: [oh] _okay ._ 
A|81| A: _today's_ young [people are] short-term pleasure oriented 
B|82| M: [today's] youth _are the_ future [of the world] . 
A|83| A: [and] everything has [to be] an immediate _reward_ [and] _it_ has [to be] fun . 
B|84| M: paper [is a] [reward] [for] [a lot of] [things] . 
A|85| A: uh-huh . _yeah ._ 
B|86| M: [i think [you] can] _make_ [your] [own] . 
A|87| A: [well] [they] say [i think i] [um] [have] read recently [that] [uh] [the] bush administration has increased [the] funding [for] [the] peace corps . 
B|88| M: [well] [it's] _the most_ peaceful thing [i've] ever heard . 
A|89| A: uh-huh . [because] [i guess] [because of the] changes [in] eastern europe [uh] they've increased funding [for] [the] peace corps . _some [of_ the] [i guess] [it's] _some [of_ the] peace dividend [in the] sense [you] known 
B|90| M: [uh] [uh] [yeah .] 
A|91| A: when [they're] decreasing _some [of_ the] military spending _some of_ [that] _money_ has gone into [the] peace corps 
B|92| M: [well] [they're] not wrong . 
A|93| A: [and] _some [of_ the] [are the] overseas programs [. uh] 
B|94| M: [yeah] [some of] [them] . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|96| M: what [do] [you] mean ? 
A|97| A: [yeah .] [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|98| M: ohhuh . 
A|99| A: uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [i] [don't] [know] maybe . 
A|101| A: [yeah] [that's] very true . [you know] _how many_ [is] _it_ [they] say [we] [have] [so] _many lawyers_ [in] this [country] [and] [i guess] [i] [i] live near washington being [in] [in] baltimore [it's] something [like] one [in] four [people] [in the] washington area [are] _lawyers_ 
B|102| M: [there] [are] [many lawyers] . 
A|103| A: [and] [and] [i] [just] sort [of] [think] [that's] ridiculous . 
B|104| M: [it's] [just] [a] joke . 
A|105| A: [yeah] [with] [with] [the] [great] needs [that we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and] [uh] [you know] [the] [the] problems [we] [have] [with] aids [and] cancer [and] [and] [how] come everybody [is a] lawyer [you know] [you know] 
B|106| M:  
A|107| A: uh-huh . [right .] 
B|108| M: [i] can't believe [that's] [how [many] people] [have been] [to] [the] moon . 
A|109| A: uh-huh . [yeah] [you] saw statistics [that] [lawyers] [and] _doctors make_ [the most] _money_ [in the] long run . 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [yeah] [that's] true . 
B|112| M: [oh i] [see] [. [i] was] thinking [that the] [money] [would [be] the] same [as] [the] [money] [that] [doctors make] . 
A|113| A: [that's interesting] . uh-huh . 
B|114| M: yes [it is .] 
A|115| A: [okay .] hey thanks [so] much [for] [the] conversation .
