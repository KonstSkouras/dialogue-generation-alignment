A|5| A: _you _know_ _,_ _i_ _,_ i_ _really_ agree _with_ [you] . _um , _i_ , uh ,_ though _i've_ never done _that_ myself _, _i_ _,_ i'm_ , _was_ [a] basically an education major when [i] graduated _from_ _college_ _and_ [i] accepted [a] job _that_ at [the] _time_ _was_ _just_ slightly above [the] _poverty_ level [to] teach [to] _, um ,_ very rural children _in_ [a] very low income district _and_ [i] spent [a] year teaching _there_ 
B|6| M: [i] 
A|7| A: _and_ [i think] _it_ _was_ probably one _of_ my largest eye-opening experiences _because_ [i] come _from_ nice middle class white suburban home 
B|8| M: _i know_ . 
A|9| A: _and_ [i] did _it_ _, um ,_ _for_ one reason [i] wanted _, _i_ was_ working on [a] masters degree _so_ [i] wanted [to] stay close [to] where _i was_ working on [a] masters degree _, but_ also _because_ [i] _just_ thought _that_ _it_ _would be_ _interesting_ [to] live _some_ place else _so_ totally different _than_ my _own_ up bringing 
B|10| M:  ... 
A|11| A: _and_ _i _,_ it_ changed _, it_ probably changed my political views _it_ changed my understanding _of the world_ _around_ me 
B|12| M: [i think] _you should_ visit [some] places . 
A|13| A: _and_ [i think] _, um _,_ in_ fact , _if_ [i] had [to] _do_ _it_ all again _i ,_ _you _know_ ,_ after _that_ , _you _know_ ,_ [you] never [think] _of_ _it_ _because_ _, i guess_ _because_ [i] paid _for_ all _of_ my _college_ education myself _, i_ never thought _about_ doing _that_ _because_ [i] had all these _college_ loans i'd started paying [back] . 
B|14| M: uhh . 
A|15| A: _um ,_ _so_ _that_ _was_ , _that_ _was_ one reason _why_ [i] never considered _it_ _but_ now _that_ _i'm_ further along , _and_ _i'm_ _still_ paying these _college_ loans _, _i_ _,_ i think_ realistically , _you _know_ ,_ _you can_ [have] _your_ _college_ loans delayed now , _because_ [i] had _them_ delayed _because_ _i'm_ [back] _in_ graduate _school_ at thirty years old , 
B|16| M: [i ,]

B|18| M: [i] [have] [time]

B|20| M: yes , [of] course

B|22| M: [i , uh _,] i think _i_ know_ what [you] mean .

B|24| M: us . 
A|25| A: uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [i'm] not [really [,] i'm] 
A|27| A: uh-huh . 
B|28| M:  ... _how_ [about] 
A|29| A: uh-huh . _yeah ._ _and_ [i think] , _you _know_ ,_ _we_ [have] such [a] need now , _you _know_ [,_ i] taught , _you _know_ [,_ [i] [,] i think _i] was_ paid [, uh ,] [about] nine thousand dollars [to] teach _for_ [the] year 
B|30| M: [i'm] [so] 
A|31| A: _and_ [i] worked _in_ [a] very rural _school_ district _and_ [i [,] [i] ,] one _of the_ _things_ [i] taught _was_ [a] computer class 
B|32| M: uuhuh 
A|33| A: _and_ these kids _, um ,_ _you _know_ ,_ every _girl_ [i] taught , except _for_ one , _was_ pregnant . 
B|34| M: [i , uh [,] uh] 
A|35| A: _many_ _of the_ boys _in the_ room had children _and_ _they were_ , _they were_ _high school_ juniors . 
B|36| M: [i'm] not [a] child [, i'm] [a] [high school] junior . 
A|37| A: _and_ [i] _just_ , _there_ , _you _know_ ,_ _they_ came _from_ _poverty_ , _they were_ going [to] condition _in_ _poverty_ _and_ _it_ _was_ _, it_ _was_ , [the] [school] district couldn't hire _many people_ _, it_ _was_ very difficult _for them_ [to] hire , _and_ [i think] , _you _know_ _,_ in the_ sense , _that_ aspect [of] public service _for_ education _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _for_ _, um ,_ _just_ social workers _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _and_ _some _of_ the_ rural areas where _they_ _just_ need advice on medical _, um ,_ _things_ [, i think] [it's] [a] [really] [good] idea . _and_ even _if_ _it is_ overseas . 
B|38| M:  
A|39| A: _see_ [, i] never [, [i] [,] i] tell [you] sometimes [i] worry [about] _things_ over seas _because_ _we_ [have] such problems _right_ here _in_ our _own_ _country_ . 
B|40| M: [i'm] 
A|41| A: uh-huh . 
B|42| M: [i'm] . [of] . 
A|43| A: _yeah ._ uh-huh . _yeah ._ 
B|44| M: [i'm] [from] [the] uk . 
A|45| A: _right ._ uh-huh . 
B|46| M: [and] [it's] [still] not _the most_ popular [country] [in [the] world] . 
A|47| A: uh-huh . 
B|48| M: uhh [, um] . yes . 
A|49| A: uh-huh . 
B|50| M: [because] [they] _are_ better [than] [the] _other_ _students_ . 
A|51| A: _yeah [._ [i] think] _it_ _would_ also help _them_ _if they_ _then_ went on [to] _college_ [. [i] know] _that_ my first couple [of] years [of] _college_ _were_ _, um [,_ uh ,] probably [too] carefree at [the] , beginning 
B|52| M: what [if they] [have been] [in] [college] [for] [a] while ? 
A|53| A: _and then_ at [the] end [i] had _to be_ _too serious ._ 
B|54| M: uhh [, i think] [they were] [just] [a] bit [too serious .] 
A|55| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [and then] [you] get [to be] [a] little [girl] [and] get [to] hang [out] [with] [them] . 
A|57| A: _yeah _,_ that's_ true . 
B|58| M: [that's] [why] [you] [have] [to] take [a] vow [of] [poverty] . 
A|59| A: uh-huh _, that's_ _right ._ 
B|60| M: [they] [do] _a lot of_ [things] _that _we_ don't_ . 
A|61| A: [i _,] yeah [, i_ think] [, i think] this _was_ , this _was_ [a] very _interesting_ topic [uh ,] [because] [it's] something [that] , _you _know_ ,_ [we don't] talk [about] [in] this [country] probably enough . 
B|62| M: _oh ,_ _well [,_ yeah [, i] guess] _that's interesting_ 
A|63| A: [uh ,] _you _know_ ,_ 
B|64| M: no [, i] [don't] [know] . 
A|65| A: uh-huh . [yeah _,] that's_ true . 
B|66| M: _because of the_ freedom [of] choices [, i guess] . 
A|67| A: uh-huh . 
B|68| M: uuhh [, _that's] , uh ,_ weird . 
A|69| A: _oh [, i_ think] _it is ._ 
B|70| M: no _, it's_ not . 
A|71| A: [i] [really] [think] [, i think] _, um ,_ [people] , [you should] [, [i] ,] _you _know_ ,_ [the] kids today [i] teach [, i] spend [a lot of] my [time] teaching [college] [students] 
B|72| M: [i think] you're wrong [, i'm] [right .] 
A|73| A: [and] _, um , _i_ find great_ disgust _in _them_ , in their _, in_ their _,_ um ,_ _their_ self-centeredness [and] _their_ inability [to] _understand _,_ um ,_ multicultural or multiracial situation 
B|74| M: [i find great] disdain [for [them] , in their [, in] the] self centeredness [, [in] them] self centered [, in] themselves . 
A|75| A: [and] [i] [really ,] _you _know_ ,_ [they] [don't] _understand [,_ uh ,] [how] [other people] live _, um ,_ [they] [don't] _understand ,_ 
B|76| M: [you know] what , you're [right .] 
A|77| A: uh-huh . [yeah [, i] think] [that's , uh ,] [just] having [a good] [time] . 
B|78| M: [i [know] [,] but] [uh [,] i'm] [uh [,] uh [,] um , i] [don't] [really] [understand ,] 
A|79| A: [i , uh ,] [a] friend [of] mine _is a_ psychologist [and] he always refers [to] _it_ _as_ short-term pleasure oriented [. [i] guess] he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] _it_ , [you [know] ,] 
B|80| M: [oh ,] _okay ._ 
A|81| A: _today's_ young [people are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|82| M: [today's] youth _are the_ future [of the world] . 
A|83| A: [and] everything has [to be] an immediate _reward_ [and] _it_ has [to be] fun . 
B|84| M: paper [is a] [reward] [for] [a lot of] [things] . 
A|85| A: uh-huh . _yeah ._ 
B|86| M: [i think] [you can] _make_ [your] [own] . 
A|87| A: [well ,] [they] say [, i think [i] [,] um ,] [have] read recently [that] [, uh ,] [the] bush administration has increased [the] funding [for] [the] peace corps . 
B|88| M: [well _,] it's_ _the most_ peaceful thing [i've] ever heard . 
A|89| A: uh-huh . [because] [i guess] [because of the] changes [in] eastern europe [, uh ,] they've increased funding [for] [the] peace corps . _some [of_ the] [, i guess] [it's] _some [of_ the] peace dividend [in the] sense , [you] known , 
B|90| M: [uh [,] uh [,] [yeah] .] 
A|91| A: when [they're] decreasing _some [of_ the] military spending _, some of_ [that] _money_ has gone into [the] peace corps 
B|92| M: [well ,] [they're] not wrong . 
A|93| A: [and] _some [of_ the] [are the] overseas programs [. [uh] ,] 
B|94| M: [yeah [,] some of] [them] . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|96| M: what [do] [you] mean ? 
A|97| A: [yeah .] [yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|98| M: ohhuh . 
A|99| A: uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [i] [don't] [know ,] maybe . 
A|101| A: [yeah [,] that's] very true . [you [know] ,] _how many_ , [is] _it_ [they] say [we] [have] [so] _many lawyers_ [in] this [country] , [and] [i guess] [, [i] [,] i] live near washington , being [in] [, in] baltimore [, it's] something [like] one [in] four [people] [, in the] washington , area , [are] _lawyers_ , 
B|102| M: [there] [are] [many lawyers] . 
A|103| A: [and] , [and] [i] [just] sort [of] [think] [that's] ridiculous . 
B|104| M: [it's] [just] [a] joke . 
A|105| A: [yeah ,] [with] [with] [the] [great] needs [that we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and] [, uh ,] [you [know] ,] [the] , [the] problems [we] [have] [with] aids [and] cancer [and] , [and] [how] come everybody [is a] lawyer , [you [know] ,] [you know] 
B|106| M:  
A|107| A: uh-huh . [right .] 
B|108| M: [i] can't believe [that's] [how [many] people] [have been] [to] [the] moon . 
A|109| A: uh-huh . [yeah ,] [you] saw , statistics [that] [lawyers] [and] _doctors make_ [the most] _money_ [in the] long run . 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|112| M: [oh , i] [see] [. [i] was] thinking [that the] [money] [would [be] the] same [as] [the] [money] [that] [doctors make] . 
A|113| A: [that's interesting] . uh-huh . 
B|114| M: yes [, [it] is .] 
A|115| A: [okay .] hey , thanks [so] much [for] [the] conversation . 
B|116| M: i'll [be] [around] . 
A|117| A: [well ,] thank [you] very much . bye-bye .
