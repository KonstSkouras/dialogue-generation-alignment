A|1| A: _uh_ 
B|2| M: _oh_ [uh] 
A|3| A: uh-huh . me too _. _i_ work_ _at_ [uh] _the_ georgia tech research institute . 
B|4| M: uhh [i work] _in_ [the] atlanta public library . 
A|5| A: um [i'm a] co-op student _so_ [i work] _and_ go _to_ school about halftime . _and_ [uh] [i] really _don't_ _have_ any job benefits _to_ speak of . we're kind of um _i don't know_ _they_ _just_ kind of forget us on that end . we _don't_ really _have_ any vacation or _you_ _know_ sick days or health care or anything really _so_ . 
B|6| M: uhhh _i think_ we've all been _there_ . 
A|7| A: exactly . exactly . 
B|8| M: _you're_ [a] . 
A|9| A: _what_ about _you_ ?

A|13| A: yeah . [uh] [they] do that [i think] if [you're] [uh] research here then [i] _know_ of some of [the] people that [have] gotten their masters _and_ [i think] that um [they] might _you_ _know_ pay for that . pay for [the] classes _and_ stuff 
B|14| M: _i have_ 
A|15| A: but [i] _know_ [they] let _you_ they'll let _you_ decrease how many hours _you_ [work] by kind of percentage . _you_ _know_ they'll let _you_ [work] halftime if _you_ want _to_ if _you_ want _to_ finish 
B|16| M: [you] 
A|17| A: [you] want _to_ yeah . they'll let [you] [work] decrease your number of hours by any percentage _just_ _just_ about _so_ if [you] want _to get_ your masters _and_ then [i think] of course [you] _get_ like [a] with your extra degrees [you] _get a_ pay raise due _so_ that will probably help out . 
B|18| M:  ... 
A|19| A: uh-huh . 
B|20| M: _it_ 
A|21| A: yeah . yeah [i think] [i] mean _that's_ _pretty_ _that's a pretty_ important [uh] part of [it] [there] because that that can _be_ really expensive if [you] ever [have] any health problems . my dad [i think] my [i'm] still covered on with my dad's [uh] health plan _at_ his where he works but [it] would definitely _be_ something _to_ look into once [i] _get_ my own . 
B|22| M: [i] [i] 
A|23| A: uh-huh . 
B|24| M: [what] ??

B|26| M: [you] . 
A|27| A: but there's there's some where [uh] [uh] student employees working for [the] government _don't_ [have] _to_ pay _social security_ tax . _that's_ about five percent right [there] 
B|28| M: [there] . 
A|29| A: _so_ . 
B|30| M: [i guess] [i'm] [just] [i'm] sooooooo good [at] being [a] person . 
A|31| A: _that's_ about [the] only real bonus 
B|32| M: _it's_ [a] free 2 . 5 
A|33| A: [i have] _so_ [i have] _to_ take that into consideration when [i] evaluate like how much [i] _get_ paid [you] _know_ because if [i] was working somewhere else i'd [have] _to_ [you] _know_ pay an extra five percent or _so_ . 
B|34| M: _it's_ [a] bit over 2 . 5 million [so] [that's a pretty] good deal . 
A|35| A: huh . yeah . 
B|36| M: [and] [you] can't [be] poor [and] _not_ [have] [a] [social security] card . 
A|37| A: [oh] yeah ? 
B|38| M: [what] ? 
A|39| A: uh-huh . yeah . 
B|40| M: [i don't know] . 
A|41| A: help [a] lot . yeah . see around around here [it's] like [uh] we [pretty] much [work] from project _to_ project on well [you] [know] with different sponsors .
