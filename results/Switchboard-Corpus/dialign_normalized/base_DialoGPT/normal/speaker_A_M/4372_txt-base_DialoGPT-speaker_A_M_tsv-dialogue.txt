A|0| A: yes . 
B|1| M:  
A|2| A: i i'll agree _it_ it's not your responsibility but is _it_ also legal for you to do that ? from what i understand from various net readings _it_ the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes uh in into place in the next few years . _it_ is _it_ is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get . with some with something like that do your arguments still apply ? 
B|3| M: :you 
A|4| A: which is exactly what businesses do at the present . 
B|5| M: lol 
A|6| A: and i i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on _it_ . 
B|7| M:  
A|8| A: that's my understanding of the way uh the way _it_ works . usually the the person ordering doesn't pay . but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay . and there there _are_ some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that . 
B|9| M: u . 
A|10| A: no . businesses uh if purchasing things mail order if if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty-six mother boards uh from from say utah . um i i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax . my accounting department will at the end of the month . i think that i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania . and i know they work that way in uh say here in d c .
