B|2| M:  ... _you don't _have_ a_ house . 
A|3| A: because _i don't_ _like_ credit cards _for_ _one_ thing [you] know _i_ mean _they're_ okay _i_ guess if _you're_ _on_ [a] trip or something [you don't _have] to_ take [a] whole bunch _of_ [you] know cash with [you] 
B|4| M: [i] 
A|5| A: _but_ _i don't_ _like_ using them because i've seen too many people _that_ used them _and_ ended up bankrupt or _on_ chapter thirteen _and_ stuff _like_ _that_ . 
B|6| M: [they're] [all] _free_ 
A|7| A: because _they_ [have] [this] weird opinion _that_ if [you] use _that_ card [you don't _have] to_ _pay_ _for_ _it_ . 
B|8| M: _why_ [don't] 
A|9| A: yeah yeah _and_ _it_ gives [you] [a] um [a] false sense _of_ security or something _it_ seems _like_ because [you] _say_ _oh_ well _i [don't_ _have] to_ _pay_ _for_ _it_ _now_ _but_ _you're_ going _to_ _have to_ _pay_ _for_ _it_ _and_ _it_ seems _like_ ...

B|14| M: _i'll [have_ to] pass [on] _that but_ _i'll_ _be_ getting [it] _back_ . 
A|15| A: _oh_ okay . well [i] know [that] [a] lot _of_ young people [you] know [i] [it] took me [a] long time [to] get [it] through my child's head [i] mean [that] was her goal [you] know _uh_ _got_ [to] [have a] credit card 
B|16| M: [i don't] _really_ [have] _any_ _of those ._ 
A|17| A: [but] _now_ [that] she has _one_ she's _only_ used [it] _one_ time [but] she wanted [to] establish some credit 
B|18| M: _what_ _about it_ ? 
A|19| A: [but] [i] think [it] finally sunk in [you] know because she saw some [of] _the_ other people _and_ just _like_ she heard them _say_ [you] know well [i] used [a] credit card . _and_ my husband's sister _is the_ world's _worst_ _at_ _oh_ well [i'll] just use _the_ credit cards _and_ she has [all] [of] her credit cards up [to] _the_ limit . 
B|20| M:  _. now_ . 
A|21| A: [you] know _and_ _i'm_ _i'm_ thinking woman wake up _and_ smell _the_ roses before _they_ come _and_ get _you ._ [but] ... 
B|22| M: [don't] ! 
A|23| A: _right_ _and_ people [don't] see [that] either . 
B|24| M: _i'm not_ _sure_ . 
A|25| A: _right ._ _the only one_ [that] _we_ _we_ [have] [that] _we_ kept was _the_ discover card 
B|26| M: [right .] 
A|27| A: _and_ [it] pays [you] [to] use [it] . [i] mean if [you] _pay_ your bill off [right] away if [you don't] ever [have to] _pay_ [any] interest [on] [it] because _they_ give [you] [a] certain amount every time [that] [you] use [it] 
B|28| M: _yes ._ 
A|29| A: _and_ [you] make [that] money as long as [you don't] ever [have to] _pay_ them [any] _uh_ interest [. now] [it's] _and_ people _say_ well [you] know [i'm] making money by using [this] credit card [but] _they_ [don't] realize [that] if _they_ [i] mean [it] _only_ takes _one_ time [for] [you] [to] use [it] _and_ [not] _pay_ _the_ interest [i] mean [you [have] to] _pay_ _the_ interest [not] _pay_ [it] [right] off 
B|30| M: lol 
A|31| A: that's going [to] take up [what] [you] would [have] made . 
B|32| M: no . 
A|33| A: _so_ that's _the only_ reason [that] _we_ kept [that] _we_ debated [for] [a] long time plus _they_ [don't have] [that] um _charge_ [on] [it] [you] know _like_ ... 
B|34| M: uuh [uh] [charge] [they] [pay] [charge] 
A|35| A: yeah . 
B|36| M: [oh] [so] [you're] saying _that it's_ [a] service [charge] ? 
A|37| A: [right .] [they] [don't have] _one_ [of those .] [so] [it] _we_ decided [that] was [it] [you] know _and_ [i] mean everybody calls us _and_ wants [to] give us [a] credit card . _we_ [have] _we_ could [have] credit cards running down our ears . 
B|38| M: [it's] [not] _like [you_ [have] a] creditcard . 
A|39| A: [yes] [yes .] _and_ then [i'll have] just [like] [uh] department stores . they'll call me up [you] know _and_ [i'll] _say_ look [i don't] want _the_ credit card well we're just going [to] send [it] [to] [you] [you] know [you don't [have] to] ever use [it] if [you don't] want [to] . they'll send me [any] credit card [i] tear [it] up . [i] just _can't_ see [it] . 
B|40| M: [i] 
A|41| A: uh-huh . yeah . 
B|42| M:  
A|43| A: [i] know [it] _and_ [you] know [what] ... 
B|44| M: [you] [can't] a' [say] [and] do . 
A|45| A: what's [really] bad [about] [those] though [is] just [like] young people if [they] [don't] [you] know _we_ take _the_ time [to] [you] know help my daughter she's in college 
B|46| M: [the] [worst] part [is] [we] [don't] 
A|47| A: [but] [it] [this is] her first credit card thing well when she _got_ her first _one_ she was [so] excited [it] was unreal . look _at_ [this] [they] sent me [this] money [you] know . [so] then when [i] explained [to] her look [you [have] to] [pay] [this] [back] [and] [they] are going [to] [charge] [you] interest [and] stuff [of] course she tore [it] up . [but] [a] lot [of] parents would [not] take [the] time [you] know [and] [they] wouldn't even think [of] [it] or their kids may [not] [be] as close as my daughter [and] [i] are [and] [uh] [you] know [they] may [not] even discuss [it] [they] go out [and] cash their check thinking [that] [you] know they've _got_ something maybe they've won something . [you] know somebody sent them something [free] . 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: [and] go out [and] spend [it] . [and] um [it's] just unreal . [i] mean [i don't] [like] credit cards [i] wish [that] [they] would come up with some other way [to] [you] know _the only_ way [you] could use them [is] if [you] were [like] [on] vacation . [they] would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] year . [you] know [i] mean [of] course [i] guess some people go out [and] spend their whole entire limit [on] [it] [like] [that] _at_ [that] time [but] um [i have] seen [so] many people [and] _i have a_ friend [right] [now] she just _got_ off [of] thirteen . she _got_ [uh] [i] [can't] remember [what] she called [it] [it's] some kind [of] maybe [it's] [sure] or something [like] [that it's] something [it's] some weird name [of] [a] credit card 
B|50| M: who 
A|51| A: [and] she [is] charging out [of] her mind already . [and] [i'm] going [you] just _got_ off . that's how [you] _got_ [on] [to] [it] [to] start with [you] know [what] _is the_ matter with [this] person 
B|52| M: [what] 
A|53| A: [but] um [it] seems [like] people just [you] know [they] just think well [i] can just [have] anything [i] want . [and] [i] just [don't] see [it] [like] [that] . [of] course [i] always see [pay] [the] bills first [and] whatever's leftover that's [what] [you have] [but] um maybe [a] lot [of] people [don't] see [it] [like] [that but] [i] [can't] stand owing . [i] mean [i] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe something [like you] know [i] guess [it's] just because i've _been_ brought up [like] [that] . [but] um [i] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing _that i_ was going [to] [have to] [pay] [this] thing out [for] ever [and] maybe suffer from having [to] payout . [but] that's just [the] way [i] feel [about it] . 
B|54| M:  ! 
A|55| A: [right .] yeah . 
B|56| M: [this] . [that] 
A|57| A: [oh] yeah . [i] guess [it] [is] [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] more [and] more people are [like] [that] . [but] um [i] guess [it's] because [i'm] older [i] mean [i'm not] real old [but] [i] am older [and] um [you] know [i] didn't feel [like] _that i_ didn't feel [like] [i] had [to] [have] everything . [i] guess [it] was because well [i] had everything when [i] was _at_ home [but] _i [i_ don't] know [why] [i] didn't . 
B|58| M:  
A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [i] 
A|61| A: yeah . 
B|62| M: [we] 
A|63| A: huh . 
B|64| M: [that] [is the] joke 
A|65| A: yeah well [it] didn't hurt [you] did [it] [to] [i] mean [you] didn't go out [and] [charge] [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything did [you] ? 
B|66| M: [i have a] feeling [that] [i'm not] [the only one] who's mad [at] [the] fact [that i] [got] [a] new phone [and] [it's] [been] 4 years . 
A|67| A: yeah well [you] learned then [right] ? 
B|68| M: [i i] [you] you' read . 
A|69| A: yeah . 
B|70| M: [you .] 
A|71| A: uh-huh .
