B|0| M: hehehehe 
A|1| A: _well_ _what about_ _the_ idea _that_ _one_ is only guilty _uh_ when proven guilty beyond _a_ reasonable doubt ? _i thought_ _that_ was _the_ point of _uh_ _a_ unanimous _jury_ was _the_ idea _that_ if everyone agrees then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt . 
B|2| M: no . 
A|3| A: but if there _are_ some _people_ who don't agree _uh_ then there must be it seems _to_ be there must be at least _a_ reasonable doubt for some _people_ . 
B|4| M: u 
A|5| A: really ? have _you_ served _on_ _a_ _jury_ ? 
B|6| M: _that uh_ . 
A|7| A: _i_ never have either but my friends my few friends who have [uh] say just _the_ opposite _they_ say they're [uh] remarkably incompetent . and [uh] don't _know_ _what_ they're doing and say _one_ thing in _the_ courtroom and then as soon as _they_ _get_ in _the_ back room _they_ just start letting all their prejudices hang out and _to_ _to_ air and all [that] . 
B|8| M: [well] 
A|9| A: right _they_ don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of _the_ legal system . 
B|10| M:  
A|11| A: and _they_ tend and since anyone can _get_ out of it who basically says _they_ don't want _to_ do it _i_ mean _you know_ it's it's anyone can _get_ out of _jury_ just _about_ and [uh] _so_ it it's [uh] it's _not_ really my peers [that] if _i_ _were_ let's say _i_ _were_ arrested falsely or _not_ and put up for _a_ _jury_ _i_ wouldn't feel [that uh] _i_ would be being tried by _a_ _jury_ of my peers . 
B|12| M:  
A|13| A: i'd be _i_ mean i'd be tried by _a_ _jury_ of _you know_ _people_ who had nothing else _to_ do and weren't very knowledgeable _about_ certain sorts of things and [uh] _i_ don't _know_ 
B|14| M: _yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _i_ _i_ _get_ _a_ little bit nervous _about_ it and [uh] 
B|16| M:  ... 
A|17| A: [yeah] _i_ _i_ was called once but _i_ was out of _the_ country and apparently _i_ apparently _they_ _thought_ _i_ served _so_ _i_ didn't _i_ didn't make any noise _about_ it _i_ came back and _they_ said _the_ record showed _i_ served but _i_ was out of _the_ country at _the_ time _so_ _i'm_ pretty sure _i_ didn't . [uh] 
B|18| M: [so] 
A|19| A: [yeah] _well i_ _i_ _i_ don't _know_ _i_ definitely feel like we need _to_ keep it at least unanimous because [uh] _you know_ there's _the_ classic sort of _to_ kill _a_ mockingbird kind of story where _you get_ _you know_ 
B|20| M: [not] 
A|21| A: and [uh] it seems _to_ _me_ [that] if _you_ could just have _a_ simple majority or something _you_ could pretty _much_ _you know_ browbeat _the jury_ _a_ majority in _the_ of _the_ _a_ majority of _the jury_ 
B|22| M: [i] 
A|23| A: that's hard _to_ say . [uh] [so] it's it's [uh] _you know_ saying [well] look we don't like _the_ way he looks and let's [uh] let's throw _the_ rascal in jail and stuff . 
B|24| M: ah um 
A|25| A: and _you_ also _get_ _a_ lot of [uh] juries _are_ extremely [uh] and from _what_ [i] hear [i] [i] have [i] have some friends who do expert witness testimony and _they_ say [that uh] juries _are_ extremely vulnerable _to_ [uh] sort of emotional pitches _you know_ _the_ prosecutor will want _to_ _oh_ [i] don't _know_ show _the_ show _the_ mugging victim _you know_ show _what_ _the_ nice person he was and _what_ _a_ family life and basically _get_ _the jury_ _to_ be very sympathetic with _the_ victim and [uh] or or [uh] if it's _a_ corporation [that] was [uh] _you know_ harming some individual or something like [that] _they_ _get_ very _much_ [well] _you know_ it's just _a_ big faceless corporation . let's let's make them _pay_ as _much_ as possible . things like [that] . 
B|26| M:  
A|27| A: [so] [not] [i] [i] mean _i'm_ _the_ problem is [i] can't guarantee [that] _a judge_ would be necessarily be _much_ better than _a_ _jury_ but i'd be real nervous having _a_ _jury_ [not] at least fully agree _on_ _what_ _the_ settlements would be things like [that] . 
B|28| M: [i] 
A|29| A: [yeah .] 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: uh-huh . [well] _how_ _about_ having _a_ _jury_ and _a judge_ work together _on_ it somehow ? _i wonder_ if that's possible ? _i guess_ _the_ judge's time is worth _too_ _much_ though . 
B|32| M: [well [i] guess] 
A|33| A: _they pay_ [that] _judge_ _they pay_ those _jury_ members very little _money_ compared _to_ [that] _judge_ 
B|34| M: [i wonder] [how] [much] [money] [they pay] [to] [the] [judge] . 
A|35| A: he makes more [money] in an hour than all _twelve_ of them put together . 
B|36| M: he's [not] [a judge] . 
A|37| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [what about] [a] [twelve] [people] ? 
A|39| A: _oh_ of course . it's it's political maneuvering . [the] _the one_ side is looking for someone whose face [they] think will _you know_ want [to] hang everyone and [the] other _one_ is going [to] look for someone very sympathetic . they're [not] looking for someone who's going [to] be [the] most reasoned or sensible or rational juror . *whose who's neither side wants [that] . [they] want [to] find [a] juror that's going [to] [uh] be most persuadable by their arguments _you know ._ 
B|40| M:  
A|41| A: [uh] [i] wish it _were_ [a] little bit harder [to] [not] _serve on_ juries actually _. i_ mean [i] _know_ it it it's tricky because [i] _know you know_ an awful lot of intelligent [people] who just [well] _i'm_ _too_ busy _to serve on_ [a] _jury_ 
B|42| M:  ... 
A|43| A: [so] i'll tell them [that] and [they] won't or just _you know_ just answer _one_ of [the] questions [the] wrong way because _you_ can do [that] _you know_ 
B|44| M: [you] 
A|45| A: [they] just say do [you] believe in such and such . [uh] 
B|46| M: [you [know] [you know] .] 
A|47| A: right . course they'd be [they] would be barred but 
B|48| M: [well] [they] [are] 
A|49| A: uh-huh . [yeah] [well] it sounds like we both need [to] _get_ out there and _serve on_ [a] _jury ._ 
B|50| M: ohh ... 
A|51| A: _i hope_ we're called up before _too_ long . 
B|52| M: [well [i] hope] [you get] [to serve on] [the [jury] .] 
A|53| A: [they] will [they] will eventually . okay [well] it was nice talking with [you] . 
B|54| M: [oh] [i'm] sorry [. [i] thought] [you] [were] [the one] [that] asked [me] [to] go [on] [the] mission . 
A|55| A: bye-bye .
