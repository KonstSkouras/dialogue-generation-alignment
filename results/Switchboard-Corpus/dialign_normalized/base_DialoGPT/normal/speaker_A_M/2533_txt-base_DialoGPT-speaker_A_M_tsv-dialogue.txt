B|44| M: [he's] [the] driver [of [the] _car] ._ 
A|45| A: _yeah_ _he_ makes good money too doing that you'd be _i was_ shocked [but] anyway someone gave an iranian [a] _tip_ [of] four rangers tickets _last_ [year] 
B|46| M: [i] 
A|47| A: _and_ then [the] iranian couldn't _he_ didn't want them [so] _he_ gave them _to_ alan _and_ alan _and_ his dad had plans that night [so] [they] gave them _to_ us [so] _he_ decided that some wealthy man tipped _this_ iranian with baseball tickets 
B|48| M: ah [i] [see] . 
A|49| A: _and_ _we_ ended up with them [right .] _and_ [so] _we_ were walking up 
B|50| M: _there_ [was] [a] moment _where_ [we] [all] agreed [to] [tip] each _other_ . 
A|51| A: _and_ [i] looked at _my_ husband _and_ [i] said [you know] _what_ kyle _this_ _is_ [the] mansion at turtle creek [a] [tip] [i] bet these [are] really good seats _and_ [so] [we] ended up _on_ first base [right] down [there] _on_ [the] floor 
B|52| M: weirdly _enough_ 
A|53| A: _oh_ _yeah_ [we] [they] called us at five _and_ [the] game started at seven [so] [we] just threw everything together ran over _and_ got [the] tickets _and_ walked _and_ [so] [we] took two kids with us _and_ nobody brings two children [in] these seats [you know] because 
B|54| M: [yeah _it] was_ . 
A|55| A: [yeah] _and_ [you] just sit down _and_ [all] [the] girls were [all] dressed up [you know] [i] just [was] [there] [you know] [like] [i'm] loaded [i'm] here [you know] _and uh_ [it was] just kind [of] funny because [you know] [but] [we] got [to] sit by first base _if_ [they did] hit [a] ball [i] would [have been] afraid [it] would [have] knocked _my_ face [in] [you _know] ._

B|90| M: _she looks_ _like a_ great [mom] . 
A|91| A: [she looks] gorgeous [no] [she's] gorgeous [and] [she] just liked having kids [and she's] _thin_ [and] [i] [mean] four or more children [are] _thin_ 
B|92| M: _why_ [is] [she] [so] [thin] ? 
A|93| A: [i] [mean] [i'm not] kidding [you] . 
B|94| M: _it's [a_ joke] . 
A|95| A: [no] [your] [i] [have] [a] friend now that [has] seven . [and] um [and] they're [all] eight [and] under [and] nine [and] under 
B|96| M: [and uh] [are] [you] [a] six [year] _old_ ? 
A|97| A: they're [all] real young they're just raised [right] [that's] [what] god's told them [to] [do] [but] they're [not] condemning [you] [if you] [we] [only] [have] one child [you know] [they] [don't] say [they] [don't] put [on] bad or anything which [is] good because [it] would be easy [i'm] [sure] for them [to] [do] that [you] get [a] conviction [like] that [and] [you] [think] everyone should [have] [it] . [and] [so] [i'm] real proud [of] them because they're aren't really [they] [don't] [do] that at [all] . 
B|98| M: [i] 
A|99| A: [you] go [in] their bathroom [and] there's ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [and] [i] always give her [a] hard [time] whose toothbrush [did] [you] really use [this] morning 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: uh-huh . [they] [live] lean for one thing [and] [they] tithe [and] [they] [it] puts [a] whole [in] [your] money bag *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor god with [this] portion [and] [so] [they] [i think] that helps [a] lot . [i think] [that's] [the] key [in] [he] [like] his sales [last] [year] [he] just works [a] normal job . [he] probably [has] an income [of] thirty-five thousand [but] [last] [year] [he] made that got him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash for [a] full size van . [he] loves god [i] [mean] [it was] [the] biggest thing that any one [in] [this] company had ever done 
B|102| M:  
A|103| A: [and] [he] got [to] [do] [it] [and] [so] god just really blesses him [in] ways [like] that [do] trust god because [i don't know] kids [are] [a] blessing [and] [and] some people [you know] [we] [think] [of] blessings as [nice] furniture [and] things [like] that [but] kids [are] just as much [of a] blessing inside these material things [but] [it's a] different kind [and] [a] lot times people [think] _oh_ well [i'm not] blessed [i] [have] an [old] [car .] [but] you've got five kids [you know] 
B|104| M:  
A|105| A: [you're] just as blessed probably more because [if you] follow [this] there's [a] good book called [what] [the] bible [has] [to] say [about] child training by richard fugate 
B|106| M:  
A|107| A: [and] [he's] [you know] [a] lot [of] wisdom [in] [it] . [and] [the] kids at bible talk [about] anything [but] training [and] training [is] different than anything else [in] [in] psychology [doesn't] address [it] . [a] lot [of the] psychology stuff [the] good stuff [that's] [in] psychology [it] just comes out [of the] bible [and] [they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb out [of] [it] [but the] things that work [in] psychology [other] [the] years that they've proven [to] work [they] just come out [of the] bible [and] [so] [this] book [it] just really [all] these things [and] how [to] train [the] child [so] they're [not] going [to] be [a] curse [to] [you] when they're thirteen . 
B|108| M: [they] 
A|109| A: [what] [i] [mean] how [to] train them [so] they're going [to] be [a] blessing [and] [so] [you know] [they] [do] that [and] [they] [they] just [live] lean [pretty] much [they] [don't] [she] [doesn't] shop at foley's [you know] [and] stuff [like] that . [but] [a] lot women die or shop at foley's [so] things 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [it's] [like a] macy's kind [of] store 
B|112| M:  ... 
A|113| A: [it's] [pretty] [nice] [and] everything's [pretty] expensive [and] [you know] [you] just can't [do] that [and] [you] [don't] go [to] baseball games as much or [you] get pictures [like] [we] [did .] [you know] [what] [i] [mean ?] 
B|114| M: [i] love 
A|115| A: [you] [do] these fun things [you know] [in] [other] kinds [of] ways [and] [i know] manhattan's real expensive [but] um [it's] kind [of a] different situation because [you're] probably living [in] an apartment [right] ? 
B|116| M: _i do_ [this] [but] [i'm] [in] manhattan . 
A|117| A: [yeah .] 
B|118| M: [oh i] [see] . 
A|119| A: well church softball leagues [so] 
B|120| M: [i'm] [a little] confused [what] [are] [you] talking [about] ? 
A|121| A: they're [not] [all] boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have] [a] girls' league because [i'm] [the] one [that's] supposed [to] start one [and] [i] just haven't gotten around [to] doing [it] . [i] keep saying [we] need [to] [have] one . [they] go okay then start one . [but] everybody wants [to] [do] [it] [but] [you know] god's sitting [on] [my] heart [and] [i] just hadn't gotten around [to] doing [it] [but] anyway [so] [they] could really [only] [have] four members [on] [the team] . [i think] [they] [only] [have] four boys . [i don't] [even] [think] [they have] [but] two [old] [enough] [to] [play] yet . 
B|122| M:  
A|123| A: [but] um then [you] didn't believe [me] [about] her kids *listen: [this] [and] utt2 as one utt [are the] [they] [are] [so] good . [i'm not] kidding [you] [but] [she] does work with them [and] [it's a] commitment [and] that [that's] [what] they're called [to] [do] . 
B|124| M:  
A|125| A: [i] [have] [a] most [of] [my] friends 
B|126| M: i'ed [you] 
A|127| A: [i know] [i do] too [i] most [of] [my] friends [have] three or four kids [and] [they] feel [like] [you know] [that's] really [why] god [and] some [of the] people [in] our church use birth control [and] some [of] them [don't] [i] had [my] tubes tied [so] [you]
