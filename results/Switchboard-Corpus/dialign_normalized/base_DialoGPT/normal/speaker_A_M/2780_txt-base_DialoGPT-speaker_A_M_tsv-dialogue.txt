B|0| M: _that ._ 
A|1| A: so _it_ _really_ _is_ _a_ different um 
B|2| M:  . 
A|3| A: _yeah that's_ _that's_ _right_ talk _to_ _i_ had _to_ talk _about_ _gun_ control with somebody _and i_ talked with _a_ woman who actually _you know_ had _just_ _purchased_ _a_ _gun_ [that] day _and_ _was_ going target shooting _you know_ 
B|4| M: [i] [gun] [gun] . 
A|5| A: _and_ _it was_ very different _it was_ _a_ whole different view _. it's_ _really_ um this has opened _my_ eyes _to_ _thinking_ _you know_ at one _time i_ _just_ sat here _and_ _thought_ _well_ _how_ can anybody believe [that] because i'd _really_ _never_ met people [that] _did_ _and_ now [i] talk _to_ people [that] _do_ . so _that's_ _it's_ _really_ interesting . 
B|6| M: i' 
A|7| A: uh-huh . 
B|8| M: [that's] . 
A|9| A: uh-huh . 
B|10| M: hey . 
A|11| A: _yeah_ . 
B|12| M: [it's] pretty cool . 
A|13| A: _yeah_ isn't _it_ funny . 
B|14| M: _oh i_ _see_ _. _i_ guess i_ [was] [thinking] _of the_ u . s . 
A|15| A: uh-huh . 
B|16| M: [and] _i'm_ not _sure_ _if_ [you] _are_ aware _of the_ fact _that _they_ didn't_ allow _it ._ 
A|17| A: _uh ._ _yeah_ . 
B|18| M: _what_ [about] _the_ fact _that they_ [never] [did] away ? 
A|19| A: _yeah_ _well_ [you] can possess 'em here too _but_ [they] _have _to_ be_ they're registered [and] _uh_ like _uh_ [the] [the] brady bill [that's] currently _being_ discussed nationally [and] whatever _is_ very _well_ supported here _in_ [gun] control avenues 
B|20| M: [i] [thought] [it was] [just] [the] federal _government_ [that] _allowed_ guns [to be] [purchased] [and] sold _in the_ state _of_ florida . 
A|21| A: _you have_ [the] seven day waiting period . 
B|22| M: _do you know_ [how] _much_ [time i] [have to] wait [to] buy [my] guns ? 
A|23| A: _yeah_ 
B|24| M: uhh _uh _uh_ huh_ 
A|25| A: [that's] [uh] [that's] 
B|26| M: _i'm_ not _sure_ . 
A|27| A: _yeah_ . 
B|28| M: _that's the_ n 
A|29| A: _yeah that's_ true [that's] very true [that's] [and] [that's the] way [i guess] most [of the] um _the political_ organizations work [you know] _the same_ _i know_ [the] abortion issue with _right_ [to] life [and] _right_ [to] choose 
B|30| M: [it's] _all_ good . [the political] issues _are_ far _from_ [being] [a] bad _thing_ . 
A|31| A: [and] [and] both [of] _them_ [are] both want [the] extent [of] extremes so [that they] _don't_ give anything for [a] balance [you know] there's there's always [that] difficulty 
B|32| M: [and _i] think that's_ fair enough . 
A|33| A: um [i] would say [i'm] probably _liberal_ _yeah_ 
B|34| M: [i'm] not _sure_ _if_ you're [liberal] _or_ not [but] [you _have] a_ _point_ 
A|35| A: _yeah_ [sure] 
B|36| M: _you don't think_ [i'm] [liberal] ? 
A|37| A: _well_ i'll tell [you] [. i] [i think] [you know] [if] [they] [if] [they didn't] give as [much] coverage [to] these idiots [that] burn _the flag_ [it] would [never] happen [do _you know] what i mean_ ? 
B|38| M: [how] [do _you] _think_ the_ us [is] gonna treat [them] ? 
A|39| A: [it's] only because [they] make [a] big stink over [it .] [but] [i] [i guess] actually [i] believe [that] [if] somebody wants [to] burn _the flag_ [i guess] [that's] their opportunity they're they're they're _right_ [in the] sense [of] freedom [of] speech [but] [i] would [never] 
B|40| M: _you _think_ that's_ wrong ? 
A|41| A: _yeah_ . 
B|42| M: _and if_ you're not [the] owner [of [the] flag] _then_ you're wrong . 
A|43| A: _yeah_ . _well_ [it's] [that they] [i [think] the] idea [of] freedom [of] speech goes back [to] [and i] [uh uh] [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] [being] able [to] display _your_ [uh] _your_ ideas [you know] [the] [what] [the] _country_ stands on _america_ stands on [is] [that they] can [do] [that] [uh] though [i] would [never] even consider [it] [in] [a] million years [to] [do] [it] myself [i] [i] [i think] [uh] [you know] [but] [i] [i] still [what] [the flag] stands for [i guess] [to] me [is] [that] [if] somebody wants [to] voice their opinion [or] display their opinion openly [and if] [that] [is] [a] [a] way [that they] can show their opinion [then] [they] should [be] [allowed] [uh] 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: unless [the] burn unless [the] actual fire hinders somebody's health [and] well-being [you know] [but] [i] [i think that's] [i guess] [that's] [i] [that's] [my] opinion _yeah_ [i guess] [you] feel differently . 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: [uh] _no_ [but] [i think that's] [that's] [uh] [it's] [that's] taxpayer's money . [if] somebody buys their own [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] [that's] fine [but] [that] [that's] [you know] [that's] destruction [and] [of] [uh] public property [and] whatever . 
B|48| M: [i] _have a_ bit i' 
A|49| A: _no_ _i don't_ [know] [i guess] [the] symbolism [oh [i] think] [what] _america_ stands for [is] [the] _right_ [to be] able [to] disagree with [the] [government] . 
B|50| M: [america] 
A|51| A: [uh] [i think that's] what's made democracy 
B|52| M: [yeah [that's] _the] thing_ 
A|53| A: [yeah] . uh-huh . [yeah] . _well_ [that's] [that's] true 
B|54| M: [it's] [the same] reason [you] can't _agree_ [to] [a] [political] _protest_ [. _it's] _a_ _right_ ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah] [but] [i think] [i] [i] [yeah] [i] [i] [i guess] [the] idea [you know] [they] always keep saying like [the] framers . um . there [uh] one [of the] republican [the] appointees for [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] always talk [about] [they] feel [that] this person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what] [the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set down . 
B|56| M:  
A|57| A: [and] um [i] believe [that] [the] idea [of] burning [the flag] [is] [is] [in] 
B|58| M: umm _. [uh_ .] 
A|59| A: [my] understanding [of] [how] [it was] framed [is] [that] [you] this [the thing] [about] this _country_ [is] [that] [you] can disagree with its [government] [and] [you] can display [that .] 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: [uh] [i] [yeah] [i] [and] [and] so [that] as [a] freedom [of] expression [and] speech [and] whatever [i] [i think] [that] [that's] viable . um as long as [it's] _your_ [flag] [and] [and] you've made _your_ _your_ [point] [. [i] think] . [yeah] because realistically like for [you] for [you] [you don't think] [it's] [right] 
B|62| M: [what] ? 
A|63| A: [and i] would [never] [do] [it [.] i] [i] love this _country_ too [much] [and] [that] _symbol_ means [a] lot [to] me . 
B|64| M: [i] wouldn't 
A|65| A: um . [but] [i guess] [it's] [just] one [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] [that's] what's something [it's a] need for [them] [you know] . 
B|66| M: [it's] ... [it's] 
A|67| A: [yeah] . yes . _no ._ 
B|68| M: [you know what i mean] . 
A|69| A: [right .] [yeah] [. [uh] huh] . 
B|70| M: [it's] not [a] [symbol] [of] [your] [country] [. [it's] a] [symbol] . 
A|71| A: [uh huh] . 
B|72| M: uhhh [uh] uhhh uhh [uh] 
A|73| A: [yeah] . 
B|74| M: [well] [i'm] [a] boy scout . 
A|75| A: [i] [agree] there too [. i] [agree] with [you] there too [. i] [i] [the] um [i] [i] [it's] [i] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting [but] _i [don't_ think] [that] _i [don't_ think] [that] [uh] we [have [a] right] [to] stop somebody [from] [that] [you know] 
B|76| M: [yeah] [no .] 
A|77| A: [the same] _i don't_ [know] [i guess i] get [i] get [uh] [all] mixed up inside . when [yeah] 
B|78| M: [i don't] [really] [know what] [you] [mean] by [that .] 
A|79| A: [it] when [it's] [uh] [it's] an emotional issue [and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] [about] [it] logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] say [to] yourself now emotionally this [is] [a] disgusting [thing] [uh] [but] logically um even [you know] for instance [the] pro life pro choice movement [uh] [you know] [i don't] [know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [but] [they] would vote pro choice . 
B|80| M:  
A|81| A: because [you know] [that's] [just] [a] disgusting [thing] [you know] somebody an abortion means [it's] somebody's [in] trouble [and] [that] [it's] an awful [thing] [you know] 
B|82| M: [i know] 
A|83| A: [but] [yeah] . [but] [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] [what i mean] [see] [but] [but] realistically when [you think] [of] [it] [it] [just] sounds like such an awful [thing] [and] [it] evokes an emotional response [. [i] think [that's] the] hardest [thing] [i don't] [know] [if] [i] could ever [be] [a] judge because some things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|84| M:  
A|85| A: [no] [no] [i [think] the] um sometimes [i guess] [what] [did] [i] read recently [the] um [the] [uh] christian [uh] [point] [is] [is] always [the] [point] [of] [well] [it's] at conception [but] [then] um [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues with others [that] conception [is] [a] biblical term . [and] there's [no] concept [of] conception [in] medicine [or] biology . 
B|86| M: [i] ? 
A|87| A: so [then] [that] so [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then] . so [it's] [i don't] [know] [. it's] very [it's] [it's] [uh] [you know] [it's a] [it's a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] [really] something [how] um [political] ideas [and] viewpoints within one [country] can vary so [much] [and] also within um within [a] 
B|88| M:  
A|89| A: [yeah] [and] [how] [yeah] [how] it'll sway [from] one one extreme [to] another . 
B|90| M:  
A|91| A: [uh] [i think] [that] [uh] [you know] [i] [i] [just] read something [i think] [in] [time] magazine [uh] [about] um [protest]
