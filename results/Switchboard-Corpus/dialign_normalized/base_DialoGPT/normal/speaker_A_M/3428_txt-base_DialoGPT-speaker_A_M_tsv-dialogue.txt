B|0| M: _then_ _that_ _and_ ? 
A|1| A: yeah _i_ can _i_ can understand _that ._ _i_ was raised in oklahoma [and] of course being oklahoman [and] texan uh yeah the hunting [and] everything [and] _i_ used to things in my father [and] my husband having guns [and] all [and] _i_ _i_ did used to be all in favor of it but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs . yet _i_ _think_ _i_ would vote a one if _i_ thought [that] it would be nation wide [and] they can guarantee _no_ one would have a gun _no_ crooks nothing . but because _i_ know that's not going to happen [then] _i_ have to probably right up there about an eight 
B|2| M:  
A|3| A: well it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten _so_ much worse than it was . there's always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas [and] _i_ know we lived in chicago for seven years [and] of course it was definitely there . _so_ when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this . it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden _so_ much worse . _i don't_ know whether it's due to the drugs [and] the uh drug kings [that] are here [and] jamaican drug kings coming in . _i don't_ know whether that's it or street gangs . _i don't_ know what the answer is . _i_ know [that] it's scary [and] yet _i_ hate the government constantly telling me what _i_ can _do_ [and] what _i_ can't _do_ [and] that's basically what the gun control would end up being . 
B|4| M:  
A|5| A: well it's very true . 
B|6| M:  . why . [that] 
A|7| A: it's not the law abiding citizen [that] you know is is dangerous with the gun it's the ones [that] are going out [and] stealing it . 
B|8| M:  
A|9| A: [and] _i_ said _i_ _think_ the only way _i_ would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee [that] nobody would have them . [and] _i_ _think_ [that] would almost have to go with armies too . _i_ mean they'd have to be almost world-wide which we know would never ever happen . 
B|10| M: [i don't] [think] [so] . 
A|11| A: because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them some idiot would come out [and] sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck . 
B|12| M: why [do] [that .] 
A|13| A: that's very true very true . who knows we maybe want to overthrow the government 
B|14| M:  ... 
A|15| A: [i] know if somebody doesn't [do] something . uh what about uh what [do] you [think] of this this uh law [that] they're putting into effect [that] you have to wait x number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun ? 
B|16| M: how [then] . 
A|17| A: _yes ._ 
B|18| M: [no] . [yes .]
