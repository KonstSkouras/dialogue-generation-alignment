A|3| A: so _you're_ _in_ _you're_ _in_ favor _of_ capital punishment _then_ . 
B|4| M: uhh [you're] thinking [of] _a_ serial killer . 
A|5| A: right . 
B|6| M: _i_ meant _that i_ _like_ _it ._ 
A|7| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . needs to be punished or _uh_ eliminated from society . 
B|8| M: serial murder 
A|9| A: right . _and then_ _do it_ all over again . uh-huh . 
B|10| M: [and _then] the_ police _would_ _just_ [do _it] _in_ prison_ . 
A|11| A: right . have to agree with _you_ [and] _i'm_ kind [of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also . [i] [just] _don't_ [think] [that] [it] acts much as [a] deterrent to these people because _uh_ _you_ still see them committing [the] same crimes _but i_ tend to agree with _you_ [that] _uh_ we should have [it] [i] [just] _i don't know_ [that] _it's_ always effective _but i_ guess we _uh_ we're kind [of] stuck with [it .] _it's_ _it's a_ difficult _uh_ problem isn't [it] to determine how [you're] going to punish somebody for [a] particular crime _uh_ 
B|12| M:  
A|13| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . right uh-huh . 
B|14| M:  
A|15| A: uh-huh huh . [do] _you_ [think] they should be punished at all or _uh_ [like] go to [prison] _uh_ because they're not really [a] danger to society . [it] was almost really self defense isn't [it in] [a] case [like] [that] . 
B|16| M: [i] 
A|17| A: uh-huh . 
B|18| M: uuhuhuh . uuhuhuuhuh 
A|19| A: [i] _know_ they put _uh_ put them [in] jail sometimes [i] guess . _uh_ 
B|20| M: [you] [don't] understand . 
A|21| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . um . uh-huh . [you] _know_ now [i] wonder what [you] [think] about this [and] _uh_ unfortunately we we [don't] get to [do it] _but_ _uh_ [it] used to be [a] long time ago [i] guess [in] biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family [then] [you] had [the] right to administer [the] punishment . so if somebody killed somebody [in] your family [then] [you] had [the] right to _uh_ if [that] person was caught [and] found guilty [you] had [the] right to _uh_ execute [that] person . [and] [i] _know_ [that] _uh_ if somebody had done something to my family [i] [would] feel [that i] had [the] right to to get revenge on them [and] _uh_ _but i_ _i don't_ [think that's] done much anywhere [that's] kind [of] drastic punishment . 
B|22| M:  
A|23| A: right . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| A: might make [you] feel better _but_ 
B|26| M: [i] 
A|27| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|28| M: well [i don't know] [i] [think] [it's a] possibility 
A|29| A: uh-huh . right . uh-huh . right because they're [a] danger to everybody else . huh [that's] interesting . [i] have to _uh_ agree with [that] . 
B|30| M: yeah [but i] [think] [it's] [just] [the] most likely scenario . 
A|31| A: there's [a] lot [of] folks probably [that] are [in prison] [that] _uh_ [that] aren't really [a] danger to society huh [and] _uh_ 
B|32| M: [uh] [uh] [i don't] [uh] ... 
A|33| A: right . right probably more [of] them [then the] other way around interesting . [i don't] [i don't] not sure [i] _i'm_ [in] washington d c or at least very close to [it .] _i'm_ not sure what kind [of] [uh] capital punishment we have here . 
B|34| M: [you] eh 
A|35| A: uh-huh .
