A|5| A: okay _well_ there's uh it's kind of an interesting topic and one _that_ _i_ _think_ _is_ quite fascinating because uh couple of years ago _i_ guess uh [not] very [not] very long ago seemed like _the_ whole world [not] just _the_ united states _but_ _the_ whole world was kind of in [a] standstill where everyone was basically in uh [you] know [a] very comfortable position so _to say_ even though _the_ _the_ cold war was was in full swing . [you] know [you] had _the_ _the_ russians against _the_ americans _the_ communists against _the_ free world and in _the_ last couple of years things _have_ changed dramatically [not] only on _the_ political front _but_ also on _the_ economic front where uh couple of years ago we had uh america was one of _the_ leading powers and one of _the_ strongest nations in _the_ world as far as economics were concerned and now we're having [a] very tough time in [a] recessionary period . we're also _have_ [a] very humongous trade deficit and uh and that's kind of frightening . also [you] know [a] couple of years ago ten fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual _going_ into [a] career could expect [to] _have_ _that_ career basically throughout their whole life and thirty years ago _that_ was _that_ was basically it whereas now we're expected [to] _have_ [a] career change every [you] know every couple of years and possibly four [to] five career changes throughout our lifetime and so _i_ _think_ uh [you] know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and and uh .
