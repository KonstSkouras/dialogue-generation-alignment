B|4| M: nope . 
A|5| A: _and_ _so_ [i just] recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago . _and_ [i'm] getting _to be_ _a good_ dancer from _it_ _and_ [i'm] [just] feeling really _good_ _. [i_ love] _the_ class _it's_ real challenging _so_ [i'm] really into _that_ [i] really [like] _that_ _a lot_ .

B|10| M: what [is] 
A|11| A: _and_ [i'm] [i'm] getting much better . my stamina [is] getting great _for_ _the_ dance floor _so_ _i mean_ _it's_ [just]

A|19| A: [i] _have a_ thirteen year old daughter _and_ _so_ we _go_ bike riding _and_ [it's] _nice ._ we _get_ [to] spend some _time_ together rather than [i] _go_ [to] _the gym_ while she does her homework . 
B|20| M: what _are_ _you_ [doing] [for] [a] week ? 
A|21| A: _so_ i've enjoyed _that_ part _of_ [it .] _yeah_ . _and_ at _the gym_ even _in the_ class uh [i] [it's not] really [a] group where [you] chat _a lot_ . everybody's on their way [to] someplace 
B|22| M: [i'm] 
A|23| A: _and_ _so_ _you _know_ _i_ do_ _have_ one friend who goes occasionally 
B|24| M: [it's not] . 
A|25| A: [but] basically _i _do_ it_ by myself _in_ [a] group _of_ _maybe_ forty _so ._ 
B|26| M: [yeah] [it's a] bit [of] [a] problem [but] [i'm] [not] [going] [to be] alone [in the gym] 
A|27| A: there [are] there _are [._ it's] _more_ motivating _that_ way _i think_ . [yeah] . 
B|28| M: oh [you know] . 
A|29| A: _you could_ _get _a_ tape_ _probably_ _and_ _do it_ at home [in] front [of] [the] t v [but] [you] _probably_ wouldn't . 
B|30| M: [i] [could] [probably] [get a] tv [in the] middle [of] [a] city . 
A|31| A: _so ._ 
B|32| M: yes . yes . [but] . if _you [have_ [a] tape] [and] can't [do [it] .] 
A|33| A: [yeah] . 
B|34| M: [you could] also use [a tape] recorder [maybe] . 
A|35| A: _yeah yeah_ _i can_ see it'll [be] [a good] break . 
B|36| M: [yeah yeah] 
A|37| A: right . 
B|38| M: he said [it] 
A|39| A: uh-huh 
B|40| M: you're welcome . 
A|41| A: _i think_ _you do . you feel very_ [good] after [you] [exercise] [. _i] think_ [it's] worth making [the] _time_ [for] _yourself ._ 
B|42| M: [i] [feel] [like] [i can] [go] back [to] sleep . 
A|43| A: _you owe_ _it to_ _yourself_ 
B|44| M: _i don't_ _know i just_ [do .] 
A|45| A: [and] _i think_ _you do_ accomplish _more_ after _that_ . 
B|46| M: [i think] [so [.] [you] do . you feel very] happy [. you] [are .] full [of] . [yourself .] [for] . [the] . full . [time [.] you] [are .] alone [. _you] [have_ a] [nice .] life [. you] deserve . [it [.] [you] owe] . [it _to] ._ [it .] 
A|47| A: [and] [i think] _that_ [it's] [just] [is] [good] [for] your self-esteem [for] everything because when [you] look better [you feel] better [and] [it's] [just] uh [i think] [it's] _well_ worth [it [.] [i] just] demand _that_ [time] [for] myself . now i've learned [to] [do] _that_ 
B|48| M: _i think [it_ is] . 
A|49| A: [and] [you know] [and] [it's] [i think it] [just] benefits [you] all around . [so .] 
B|50| M: yes [i think] [i [do] .] 
A|51| A: [you _have] [to_ .] because _there's_ always _more_ things [to] [do .] 
B|52| M: what [is] [that] ? 
A|53| A: there [is] always things [that] [you] [can] make priority _to it_ [but [i] just] [i don't] demand _a lot_ [for] myself [and] [so] [you [know] i just] [feel] entitled _to it_ 
B|54| M: [well] [i think] [there's] [more] [to [it] .] 
A|55| A: [and] [i] [take it] [so .] 
B|56| M: [you] dont [have to] 
A|57| A: no i've done some _walking_ with friends [in the] past . 
B|58| M: [have] [you] ? 
A|59| A: [but i] find [that] when [you do] [that] [you do] [more] chatting than [you do] [exercise] 
B|60| M: [i do] [a lot of] [walking] . 
A|61| A: [and] [that's] [not] really beneficial [so] uh [i don't] [have] [time] [like] [that] 
B|62| M: [i'm] [not] [too] sure . 
A|63| A: [and] [i] spend enough [time] chatting around everywhere [you know]
