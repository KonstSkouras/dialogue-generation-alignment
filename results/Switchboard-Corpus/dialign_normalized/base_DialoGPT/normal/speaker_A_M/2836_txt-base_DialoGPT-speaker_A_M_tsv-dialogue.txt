B|0| M: _i_ 
A|1| A: _what_ _uh_ _is_ _there_ anything _uh_ _that_ _you_ particularly _are_ concerned _with_ _in_ _your_ particular _area_ as far as security _and_ _that_ _sort of_ _thing_ ? 
B|2| M:  
A|3| A: uh-huh . _do_ _you_ live _in_ _a_ real small town or or _out in the_ country ? 
B|4| M:  
A|5| A: _how_ far _out_ _from the_ _city_ [i] mean _do_ _you_ 
B|6| M: [you] [what] [you] [do] . 
A|7| A: _about_ fifteen miles _. i_ live _in_ _a_ little suburb _uh_ which _is_ [i] guess _from_ dallas _is_ twelve miles or _so_ 
B|8| M: [what] [city] ? 
A|9| A: _but_ _it's_ pretty congested . _we_ _are_ considered _in the_ country 
B|10| M: aye _i'm_ [in the] _us ._ 
A|11| A: _but_ _it_ doesn't _really_ _feel_ _like_ _you're_ [in the] country . 
B|12| M: _it's not_ [that] bad [you] _just_ _have to_ _get_ used _to_ [it] . 
A|13| A: our _major_ crimes [in] our immediate town _uh_ _is_ probably robberies house robberies _and_ very few instances _of_ _you know_ alcohol drugs _uh_ reported . 
B|14| M: [what] [is] [your] [major] crime ? 
A|15| A: however _i'm sure_ _they're_ _there_ . 
B|16| M: [the] _only_ [thing] [i] _can_ _think_ [of] [is] [that] [there] [are] _no_ _guns_ [in the] [area] . 
A|17| A: _but_ _uh_ _right_ _now_ our neighborhood [is] running _about_ _uh_ eighty percent [of] [the] homeowners [have] been robbed sometime during their their _uh_ existence [in] [that] neighborhood . 
B|18| M: hm _yeah ._ 
A|19| A: _and_ since [that] time everybody's got some _sort of_ burglar system or _you know uh_ burglar alarms _uh_ _and_ including [the] _out_ _uh_ [the] outer perimeter type _uh_ devices sensors _and_ things _like_ _that ._ 
B|20| M: _they_ [have] [that] _now ?_ 
A|21| A: [it's] cut back _you know_ considerably _but_ [it] [it] [just] shifts [it] _from_ our neighborhood [to] another neighborhood [to] _other_ neighborhood _so_ [it] _still_ _uh_ remains [city] wide pretty pretty high . 
B|22| M: _that's_ yay y'all 
A|23| A: _uh _i_ would_ _say_ _the majority_ [of] [it's] _happening_ during [the] day _uh_ between probably ten [in the] morning _and_ three [in the] afternoon . 
B|24| M: [i'm] 
A|25| A: _most_ 
B|26| M: _most _of_ it_ ? 
A|27| A: _well_ [most] families [most] families [are] _young_ _and_ both _people_ [are] working . 
B|28| M: [i] thought [it] _was_ _because_ [the majority] [is] [young] _not_ old . 
A|29| A: _so_ _they're_ _happening_ during [the] hours _they're_ gone _from_ _work_ . 
B|30| M: _they_ [are] [happening] 
A|31| A: _uh_ _so_ _uh _i_ would_ _say_ [that's] probably their prime motivation . they'll they'll stock [your] house _and_ _uh_ look at [your] pattern _and_ then _go_ _from_ [there] . 
B|32| M: [well] [i would] _have to_ _get_ [the] [right] [sort of] person _to do_ [it] . 
A|33| A: _uh_ [they] classify [most _of] them_ as professionals . 
B|34| M: [what] _are _the_ _people_ who_ [do] [the] [work] ? 
A|35| A: _uh you_ [get] _a_ few _of them_ [that] [are] _a_ little bit sloppier _uh_ [just] taking _uh _you_ know_ [just] junk items _that they_ _they can_ [just] _get _you_ know_ ten [to] twenty bucks _for_ real quick . 
B|36| M: uhh [i] _don't_ _think_ [you] understand . 
A|37| A: probably [the] biggest items [that] _uh_ [that] [you] [get] [in] our neighborhood or _would be_ [the] high classed automobiles [the] _you know_ mercedes volvos things _that _they_ can_ _get _you_ know_ big dollars _for_ _and_ [the] jewelry [are the] [major] targets 
B|38| M: h 
A|39| A: [guns] [that] [sort _of] stuff_ . 
B|40| M: [what] 
A|41| A: very few _you know_ penny penny ante _stuff_ . 
B|42| M: [what] kind [of stuff] ? 
A|43| A: [well] _uh_ _the police_ force _for_ one _i _think_ they_ _could_ _uh_ definitely add [to] _the police_ force _and_ [the] type equipment _that they_ use . _uh_ [it's] oh [right] [now] _i think_ _we_ [are] _about_ thirty thousand [people] _and_ there's [only] eight officers [that] patrol _for_ thirty _for_ [that] amount [of] [people] which _is not_ very _many_ . 
B|44| M: [what] [are] [you] talking [about] ? 
A|45| A: _and_ 
B|46| M: [they're] [not] . 
A|47| A: _well the_ course [in] our particular state _uh_ _we have_ [the] prison overcrowding whatever _so_ [they're] giving [the] early release _uh_ 
B|48| M: [it] 
A|49| A: [yeah] _and_ _and_ [it's] _i think_ [what] [they] need [to do] [is] stop _building_ _more_ jails _and_ start giving stiffer sentences _uh_ _but_ _for_ [the] 
B|50| M: [i] am [i'm] [so] _we're_ [not] [building] prisons . 
A|51| A: [that] _would be_ certainly _be_ _a deterrent ._ 
B|52| M: [i'm sure] [there] [are] [many] [other] countries [that] _don't_ [have] this _problem_ . 
A|53| A: _and_ _uh_ [not] necessarily _you know_ give [in] [to] their _uh_ human rights desires . _you know_ _if_ [they're] overcrowded [just] keep cramming _them_ [in] [there] till [they] [just] suffocate . _uh_ 
B|54| M: _no_ _but [they_ can] [be] used [for] this purpose . 
A|55| A: _uh _i_ think_ they'd [have _to] go_ [to] extra measures [to] _make_ [sure] _a_ person's _guilty_ _you know_ [in] _a lot of_ cases . course [i] _i know_ _you can't be_ _a_ hundred percent foolproof . 
B|56| M:  ... [and] [that's] 
A|57| A: _uh_ 
B|58| M: [i] [uh i] [can't] . 
A|59| A: i'd rather see [it] _a_ little bit harder [and] _have a_ little bit _more_ evidence [uh] [to] convict somebody 
B|60| M: [you] [would] [think they] [would be] able [to] . 
A|61| A: [and] then _those_ convicted especially [of] _you know_ murder [and] [and] _uh _you_ know_ [major] crimes [uh] [to] reach [the] life sentences [and] _you know_ death penalties [and] follow-through _with_ _that ._ 
B|62| M: [they] [are] [still] [a] crime though . 
A|63| A: [uh] especially _you know_ [in the] _case_ [of] murder 
B|64| M: [uh] [uh] [uh] 
A|65| A: [uh _i] know_ [in] my _case_ [i] my wife [and] daughter were kidnapped during [a] house robbery back [in] eighty-five 
B|66| M: [i know] . 
A|67| A: [and] _we_ caught [the] individuals got caught _we_ [uh] _we_ went through [the] court system [and] _all_ [that] [sort of] [thing] 
B|68| M: did [you] [really] ? 
A|69| A: [and] _uh _you_ know_ two counts [of] kidnapping _uh _you_ know_ [the] [the] forty-five [to] [the] head _you know_ [just] [the] [the] mental anguish [and] [the] whole nine yards _uh _you_ know_ [the] guy [only] got five years . 
B|70| M: [i] _was_ going [to] [say] 
A|71| A: [and] _you know_ _he was_ _out_ within two months [because] [of] [the] parole system . [so] [what] [what] 
B|72| M:  ... i've _never_ seen [a] dog [out in the] 
A|73| A: [do] [what] [now ?] 
B|74| M: [you know uh] [uh you] did [uh] [uh] 
A|75| A: [no] . [i'm] [not] real familiar _with_ _that ._ 
B|76| M: did [he] sue [you] [for] damages ? 
A|77| A: oh . 
B|78| M: [you know] [that's] [a] good idea [. i] _don't_ [know] [how] much _money_ [i] [could] [make] [from] [it] . 
A|79| A: _well the_ insurance companies [and] _all_ [that] tried [to] tried _to go_ after him [and] [they] said [well] [you know] [he] [they're] _he has_ [no] job _he has_ nothing there's nothing _that he has_ [that] [that] [you] [could] _go_ after . 
B|80| M: why [would] [you] ? 
A|81| A: [yeah .] [uh] very 
B|82| M: [he] [is not] [a] _criminal_ _and he_ [is not] [guilty] [of] _any_ crime . 
A|83| A: [yeah .] _they don't_ [do] [that] here . course [they] pay _them_ [but _they] don't_ [you] [don't] [you] or [the] insurance companies [never] see [any] [of] [that] [money] . 
B|84| M: [the] _us ._ 
A|85| A: [and] [uh [you] know] [and] [they're] [right] [now] [they're] reluctant _to go_ after him [because] [they're] [you know] [they're] [they're] repeat offenders [they] [uh] been _in jail_ before 
B|86| M: [but] _he's_ an ex cop . 
A|87| A: they've been released [you know] several times which [is] another [uh] deal _i hate to_ see . 
B|88| M: [i hate to] [say] [it] 
A|89| A: [but] [uh [you] know] basically [the] guy commits [you know] three [major] crimes [and] [and] [uh] [and] car theft on top [of it] destroys my car 
B|90| M: _yeah i_ 
A|91| A: [and] [we're] [out] [you know [uh] [you] know] fifteen thousand dollars [and] [you know] [the] guy gets [out in] two months 
B|92| M: [i think] [it's] [yeah .] [yeah .] 
A|93| A: [and he] goes [out] [and] commits [it] again . fact [he's] back _in jail_ [now] . [so] [what] [what] [uh] 
B|94| M: [i think] [you're] thinking [of] [yeah .] [yeah .] [that .] [was] . [like] . [a] . [thing] 
A|95| A: [yeah .] [what] [what] _deterrent_ does [he] [really] [have] ? 
B|96| M: [i'm] [just] glad [he's] [not] [in jail] . 
A|97| A: [yeah _i] think in_ our [in] our particular neighborhood vigilantism [is] becoming [a] real real possibility . 
B|98| M: [i think in] this [case] [it's] [just] _more of_ [a deterrent .] 
A|99| A: _uh we've_ _had a_ couple instances where _break_ ins where [the people] [have] actually [you know] shot [the people] 
B|100| M: [uh we've] [never] [had a] [break] [in] . 
A|101| A: [and] [uh] return offenders [have] they've actually waited [for] _them_ where they've robbed [you know] particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then [other] [people] will wait up [you know] [and] wait [for] somebody [to do] something else try [to] take [it] [in] their own hands . 
B|102| M: hahaha . nice . 
A|103| A: course [it] doesn't always [work] [out in] their favor . 
B|104| M: [what] [if] [you] [have a] family [and] family members _who_ [would] [like] [to go] home ? 
A|105| A: [but] [uh] nevertheless [i think] [people] [are] [just] getting fed up [and] saying [you know] _you can't_ arrest _all_ [of] [us] 
B|106| M: _it's not_ [a] story [the police] [would] tell [you] . 
A|107| A: [you] [can] [you know] [you] [can] [get] some [of] [us] 
B|108| M: [you can't be] serious . 
A|109| A: [you can't] [get] _all_ [of] [us .] 
B|110| M: [we [have] [a] lot [of] them] 
A|111| A: [uh] [and] [we're] beginning [to] see [more] [and] [more of] [that .] 
B|112| M: [we're] [all] gonna [make] [it] brah 
A|113| A: [yeah .] 
B|114| M: _it's a_ good [deterrent] 
A|115| A: [yeah] [that's] [i] mean [that's] certainly [a] possibility [in] [in] [we have] [had a] few cases where [the] guy _has_ broken [in] [you know] during [the] middle [of] [the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|116| M: [i think] [the] point [is] [that he has] _to be_ careful [not] [to] [break] [in] . 
A|117| A: [and] [uh] [it] helps [for] [a] while 
B|118| M: [well] _they do_ [have a] way [to] [get you] [to] shoot [them] ... 
A|119| A: [but] then [just] another _different_ set [of] [people] come [in] [and] [most of] [the people] [are] transients [from] [out] outside [of] [the] state . 
B|120| M: [it's] [the] same person [just] [different] pronouns . 
A|121| A: [uh [i] would] [say] probably eighty percent [of them] [that] [are] caught [they're] [from] places [like] up [in] oklahoma [and] louisiana _arkansas_ [you know] across [the] [the] border . 
B|122| M: [i] wonder [how] [many] [of them] [are] [from] [arkansas] 
A|123| A: [so] [you know] [people who] [don't] readily read [the] newspapers [in] our town or whatever 
B|124| M: [i think] [he was] joking 
A|125| A: [it's not] [many] _from the_ local communities . 
B|126| M: [how] [many] [of] [those] [are] [from the] towns ? 
A|127| A: [but] [uh] [it's _a] problem_ [and] [i] [i] [just] [i think] [that] [the] court systems need [to be] [more] accurate [in] [in] stiffer [in] their penalties 
B|128| M:  ... [but] ... [it's not] [a problem] . 
A|129| A: [would be] [a] definite [deterrent] [and] [and] [uh] giving [the] [uh] [police] [uh] agencies [a] little bit [more] jurisdiction over [what] [they do] _when_ [they] _when_ [they] catch these [people] . 
B|130| M: [well the] [problem] [is] [that [they] don't] [know] [what] [to do] [with] [them] . 
A|131| A: [right] . 
B|132| M: [there] [is] [that] ? 
A|133| A: uh-huh . 
B|134| M: [i] am 
A|135| A: [i know] [like] [in] my wife's [case] [they] made her _feel_ [like] [the] [criminal] . 
B|136| M: [how] did [you] [feel] [when] [you] saw [the] news ? 
A|137| A: [they] [they] went [to] [all] [all] ...
