A|57| A: _and , uh ,_ 
B|58| M: [and , uh [,] uh] 
A|59| A: [yeah .] _well [,_ i] took [a lot of] time [in] choosing [this] site [because] [the] [, [the] house] has [no] heating or _air_ conditioning . 
B|60| M: [well ,] how [about] [you] ? 
A|61| A: [well _,] it's_ got [a] , _a very_ small furnace . 
B|62| M: how [do] [you] [like] [your] ... 
A|63| A: [and] [a] [, uh ,] we'll use [a] _wood burning_ stove as [well] . 
B|64| M: i'll [make] [a] fire . 
A|65| A: but , [in [the] house] itself , _i've_ _been_ working inside _, you know ,_ these , these many months 
B|66| M: [it's] _not_ [that] [. it's] [the] [wood burning] . 
A|67| A: [and] [i have] [not] had [to] use _the heat_ . 
B|68| M: you've [been] using [the heat] ? 
A|69| A: [because it's] all geothermal . 
B|70| M: why [is] [the] [air] [so] cold ? 
A|71| A: [and] [with] all [the] , _see_ _i've_ got , _on_ [the] south _side is_ all glass . [well ,] as much as [i] could get [in] [it] _, you [know_ .] [and _, uh ,] the east _side_ is_ glass . 
B|72| M: [i have] seen [this] . 
A|73| A: _i've_ got one , two , three , four , five , six _windows [in_ _the] east side_ _on_ forty-eight feet . [so] [it's] almost all glass . 
B|74| M: [no] [, the] west [side [is] [a] lot] more green . 
A|75| A: [and , uh ,] 
B|76| M: [i] think , if you're [going] [to be] [that] [guy] [, _it's] ,_ [like] , if [, uh , the east [side] of] [the] mississippi , [it] should [be] [the east [side] of] [the state] . 
A|77| A: oh , [yeah .] [i] [mean] _, you [know_ .] there's [no] place [in [the] house] where _you can_ stand [and] [not] _see_ four _windows ._ 
B|78| M: [i've] always wondered why [i've] never seen any [windows in] [my] [house .] 
A|79| A: [so] [, uh ,] 
B|80| M: [i like] [windows .] 
A|81| A: [well ,] [not] really [. [it's] [,] uh [,] it's] _on_ [the] [side of] [a] hill . 
B|82| M: [is] [that] [the] only door ? 
A|83| A: [so] [the] first _, you know [,_ the] [, the] [, the] , [what] [i] [call] residential level at [the] [side] [that's] [in the] hill [is] [about] four feet deep . 
B|84| M: [what] [is] [the] [second] floor ? 
A|85| A: [and] [the] [side] [that's] _on_ [the] [, uh , the] [other] [side is] [about] six feet high . 
B|86| M: [you know] [what] ? 
A|87| A: [so] [i've] got [a] pretty good grade there . 
B|88| M: he nods . 
A|89| A: [and] [then] when [i] put [the] verandas which will [be] twelve feet _out_ all [the] way around _on_ [the] north , south [and] [east] sides [that] will define _the _shop_ ._ 
B|90| M: [i] think you'll find [it's] [a very] confusing [shop .] 
A|91| A: exactly . 
B|92| M: [i'm] [going] [to] [make] [a] joke [about] [it] . [i'm] [going] [out] [on] [a] limb [and] saying [that] [this] [is a] victorian [shop .] 
A|93| A: uh-huh . 
B|94| M: [you [can] [see] the] little shelf for [the] back [of] [the shop] [in the] picture . 
A|95| A: uh-huh . 
B|96| M: uhhh [, you know ,] [i'm a] human .
