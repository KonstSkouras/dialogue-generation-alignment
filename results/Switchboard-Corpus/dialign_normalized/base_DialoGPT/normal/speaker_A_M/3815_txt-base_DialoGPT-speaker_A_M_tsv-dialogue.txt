B|0| M: _what_ kind _of_ _car_ ? 
A|1| A: uh-huh . 
B|2| M: _what_ kind _of_ _car_ ? 
A|3| A: _i_ see 
B|4| M: _uh_ _uh_ _i'm not_ _sure_ . 
A|5| A: top [of] top [of] _the_ line . 
B|6| M: how is _this_ _a_ thing ? 
A|7| A: _oh_ . 
B|8| M: you're _not_ _my_ friend . 
A|9| A: uh-huh . right right . 
B|10| M: _no_ _it's not_ . 
A|11| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|12| M: uhh _what_ ? 
A|13| A: _well i guess_ [i'm] [uh] more traditional in _that_ _i don't like_ power windows _or_ power locks _because_ _the_ _people_ _that_ _i know_ who _have_ them always seem _to_ _have_ trouble with them . 
B|14| M: [oh] [well i guess] _that's_ how _you_ feel . 
A|15| A: _and_ [uh] so _i don't_ [i] just _don't like_ anything _that_ _i can't_ figure out _why_ _it_ doesn't work 
B|16| M: [why] ? 
A|17| A: _and_ then [i] want _you know_ _good_ [uh] gas mileage _and_ [i] want an air bag _and_ _uh [i_ guess] 
B|18| M: [and] _that's_ [uh] _it ._ 
A|19| A: [no] [i] haven't . _have_ [you] ? 
B|20| M: [have] u ever ? 
A|21| A: somehow [i] just _think_ _you _know_ _i_ like the idea_ 
B|22| M: _i'm not_ _sure_ [i] [have] [no] _idea ._ 
A|23| A: right . 
B|24| M: [you] _sure_ ? 
A|25| A: right [that's] [a] _good_ [idea .] 
B|26| M: _i actually [i_ like] [that] [idea .] [you know] [because] [uh i] [think] it'll [uh] ... save lives . 
A|27| A: uh-huh uh-huh . 
B|28| M: how _do you_ _do_ [it] ? 
A|29| A: [well [i] actually _i] don't know_ [a] lot about different brands . [i] tend _to_ [have] [you know] [my] requirements _like the_ last time [i] bought _a car_ [i] [i guess] [i] did sort [of] prefer american [and] [my] requirements were basically [you know] _good_ repair record _good_ mileage [uh] [and] [i] needed air-conditioning [and] [uh] _can't_ remember [what] [my] [oh] [i] wanted [uh] _stick shift ._ [and] so [i] didn't [have] [a] whole lot [of] choice there _was_ one [car] in all [of] _the_ _the_ metropolitan area [that] [i] could _find_ [that] [you know] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with _a stick shift_ in [it .] 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: [it] [it] turned out _to_ _be_ [a] [a] chrysler _. uh_ lancer . 
B|32| M: [no] . 
A|33| A: _yeah ._ 
B|34| M: [a] [. uh] . [yeah] [shift .] [shift .] 
A|35| A: [no] [a] five _speed_ . [and] [it] basically _it was_ something [that] [a] military guy had ordered [and] hadn't picked up [and] so [it] had been on _the_ lot _three_ months [and] they were really eager _to_ sell [it .] 
B|36| M: [was] [it] [a] [three] [or] four [speed] ? 
A|37| A: so [i guess] in [this] area at least [you know] _if_ [it's not] automatic [it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [it _was] a_ manual . 
A|39| A: [well i] just wanted [it] [because] again [i] had [i guess] traditionally always had _a _car_ that_ had one [and] _i thought_ [it] would _be_ more reliable . 
B|40| M: i'll . 
A|41| A: [uh] 
B|42| M: _why do you [like_ the] _stick shift ?_ 
A|43| A: [i] found [that] out . [i] mean [you _know] the_ _people_ would just sort [of] look at me [like] [you] must _be_ crazy when [i] went in _to_ [and] asked [and] [that] [was a] requirement so 
B|44| M: [i can't] [find] any [stick shift] [car that] has [a] manual transmission . 
A|45| A: so 
B|46| M: [that's] [what] [i thought] . 
A|47| A: [well] [i'm not] even [sure] all [of] them are anymore . at least in [this] area . 
B|48| M: [i] am . 
A|49| A: [not] [that] [i] [was] looking for sports cars _but_ now [the] _people_ i've talked _to_ _don't_ seem _to_ [have] _stick shift ._ 
B|50| M: [i [know] the] majority [of] [people] [don't] [but] i'd [be] willing [to] drive [a stick shift] [car] [if] [it] meant driving manual . 
A|51| A: [and] so [why do you like] [stick shift ?] 
B|52| M: [i] love [stick shift .] 
A|53| A: uh-huh . 
B|54| M: [i don't [know] [i] don't like] stickshift . 
A|55| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|56| M: [it's] [like] [a car] . 
A|57| A: right [and] [actually] [it's] probably safer on [you know] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [i like the idea] [of] [it] [but] [i don't know] [i'm not] [a] very [good] pilot . 
A|59| A: so 
B|60| M: [yeah] [yeah .]
