B|28| M: how _do you_ _do_ [it] ? 
A|29| A: [well , [i] , actually] _i don't know_ [a] lot about different brands . [i] tend _to_ [have] , [you know ,] [my] requirements _like the_ last time [i] bought _a car_ [i [,] i guess] [i] did sort [of] prefer american [and] [my] requirements were basically , [you know ,] _good_ repair record , _good_ mileage [, uh ,] [and] [i] needed air-conditioning [and] [, uh ,] _can't_ remember [what] [my] , [oh [,] i] wanted [uh ,] _stick shift ._ [and] , so [i] didn't [have] [a] whole lot [of] choice there _was_ one [car] in all [of] _the_ , _the_ metropolitan area [that] [i] could _find_ [that] , [you know ,] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with _a stick shift_ in [it .]

B|32| M: [no] . 
A|33| A: _yeah ._ 
B|34| M: [a] [. uh] . [yeah] , [shift .] [shift .] 
A|35| A: [no ,] [a] five _speed_ . [and] _it ,_ basically [, _it] was_ something [that] [a] military guy had ordered [and] hadn't picked up , [and] so [it] had been on _the_ lot _three_ months [and] they were really eager _to_ sell [it .] 
B|36| M: [was] [it] [a] [three] [or] four [speed] ? 
A|37| A: so [, i guess] in [this] area , at least , [you know ,] _if_ [it's not] automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [it _was] a_ manual . 
A|39| A: [well , i] just wanted [it] [because ,] again [, i] had [, i guess] traditionally always had _a _car_ that_ had one [and] _i thought_ [it] would _be_ more reliable . 
B|40| M: i'll . 
A|41| A: [uh ,] 
B|42| M: _why do you [like_ the] _stick shift ?_ 
A|43| A: [i] found [that] out . [i] mean , [you know ,] [the] _people_ would just sort [of] look at me [like] , [you] must _be_ crazy when [i ,] went in _to_ , [and] asked [and] [that] [was a] requirement so , 
B|44| M: [i can't] [find] any [stick shift] [car that] has [a] manual transmission . 
A|45| A: so , 
B|46| M: [that's] [what] [i thought] . 
A|47| A: [well [,] i'm not] even [sure] all [of] them are anymore . at least in [this] area . 
B|48| M: [i] am . 
A|49| A: [not] [that] [i] [was] looking for sports cars _, but_ , now [the] _people_ i've talked _to_ _don't_ seem _to_ [have] _stick shift ._ 
B|50| M: [i know] [the] majority [of] [people] [don't [,] but] i'd [be] willing [to] drive [a stick shift] [car] [if] [it] meant driving manual . 
A|51| A: [and] so [why do you like] [stick shift ?] 
B|52| M: [i] love [stick shift .] 
A|53| A: uh-huh . 
B|54| M: [i don't [know] , [i] don't like] stickshift . 
A|55| A: uh-huh . right . 
B|56| M: [it's] [like] [a car] . 
A|57| A: right , [and] [actually] [it's] probably safer on , [you know ,] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [i like the idea] [of] [it [,] but] [i don't [know] [,] i'm not] [a] very [good] pilot . 
A|59| A: so , 
B|60| M: [yeah] , [yeah .]
