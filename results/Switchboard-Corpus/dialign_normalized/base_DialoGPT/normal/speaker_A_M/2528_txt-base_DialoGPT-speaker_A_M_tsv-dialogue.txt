B|40| M: [it's] [sunday] morning [in new] england .

A|43| A: definitely [seen it] [on] [on] during [the day] down there _and [i_ don't] [think [it's] a] very violent _show_ [i think it's] funny . [i think [it's] a] real _good_ concept [i think it's] something completely [new] . 
B|44| M: [not] ahem 
A|45| A: [i think] _so_ [i think] because _people_ sort [of] get through [you] [know] um [i think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn [the] importance [of] sort [of] physical fitness as well as [the] as well as [you] [know] _some_ mental fitness _and [i_ think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn _good_ sportsmanship [and] _so_ forth . 
B|46| M: [you] 
A|47| A: well [don't] _they_ take _people who _have_ some_ sort [of] um big abilities like [and and] at least _they_ used [to] when [it] when [it] [the first] ones [i] saw _they_ _had_ um [a] man [on] _who_ [was] uh _he_ played college football [and] almost went pro [and] _they_ _had a_ [a] woman _who_ [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] [the] uh she [was] [in the] junior olympics or something or _they_ seem [to] [have] _people who have_ very very big sports backgrounds . [to] [have] _they_ leaned away from [that] sort [of] 
B|48| M: [what] . lol 
A|49| A: oh [that's] _how_ _they_ _do it ._ 
B|50| M: [i] 
A|51| A: _really_ ? 
B|52| M: [so] . 
A|53| A: yeah okay [i] [just] thought _they_ _had_ _some_ 
B|54| M: they're [just] making [a] joke . 
A|55| A: yeah [i] thought _they_ _had_ _some_ sort [of] [i mean] [i] thought _they_ were [just] poor _people_ like us [i] guess [not] [that's] great . 
B|56| M: they're pretty [good] . 
A|57| A: [but] maybe i'll try [it] one [day .] i'll get [on] there one [day] [and] see if [i] can uh um [what] [what do] _they_ win _they_ _they_ win _money_ [i think] [don't] _they_ ? 
B|58| M: [not] much [but] _they [have_ some] 
A|59| A: _really_ ? 
B|60| M: [there's a lot of] [people who have] [a lot] more [money] than [i] [do] . 
A|61| A: wow . _all_ [that] for getting tennis balls shot at [you] at [a] hundred miles an hour . 
B|62| M: [how] much ? 
A|63| A: one [little] ball here [and] there yeah [and] [this] guy's beating [you] up [so] [i [don't] know] [the] beating up part . [i] [i] actually feel [the] tennis balls would hurt . 
B|64| M: [i think] [he] [was] [just] making [a] joke . 
A|65| A: [they] look like yeah [they] seem like [a] tennis ball [but] [it] almost doesn't look like [it's] almost livable yeah [the best] [i] [i don't] [think] [i] could [i] [i] could handle those tennis balls . [so] [what] else [to] [you tape] besides american at there anything else ? 
B|66| M: [this] 
A|67| A: _huh ?_ 
B|68| M: we're 
A|69| A: okay .

A|77| A: uh-huh . oh okay well [they] seem [to be on] later 
B|78| M: [that's] [not] [really] [the] case [i've] never [had a] case [in] which [the] defendant [was] [not] involved . 
A|79| A: _all_ always _right_ _right_ before [the news] [is] when [i] catch them . [i] [i] tend [to] if nothing else [is] [in the] town television at eleven o'clock [just] [to] watch [the news] [and] or or nightline or something [just] sort [of] get [a] [good] [you] [know] [a] [good] [a] [good] [think] for [the day .] 
B|80| M: uhm .

A|85| A: yeah ours [is] [on] 
B|86| M: [we are] [all] [in _the] same_ place [right] ? 
A|87| A: actually [it] ours [is] [on] at eleven [it] [it's] um eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here [in new] york . um [i think] [they] [they] [do] [that] [i think] [they] put things [on] at um eleven o'clock here _and [i_ think] [they] put [it] like eleven o'clock um california [time] like [in] california [but] [in the middle] [they] sort [of] um like central [time] or mountain [time] [they] [they] push things back . [so] [i was] actually actually [i'm] [not] sure [i was] [in] [i was] [in] iowa awhile ago [and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier [so] does [your] prime [time] start at seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M:  
A|89| A: wait [no] [no] 
B|90| M: [i] ... 
A|91| A: [not] [not] even [the news but] [do] [they have] like um [do] like sort [of] [all] [the] regular sitcoms [and] [so] forth start at seven o'clock ? [you] [so] like [you] [know] [the] regular television shows [that] [are] [that] [are] very popular [do] [they] start at seven or or at eight ? 
B|92| M:  
A|93| A: [right] because [that] would [the] eight o'clock here . 
B|94| M: [it's] [the] [show .] 
A|95| A: yeah [that] [that] would [all] start at at um [that] would [all] start at at eight o'clock here [that] wouldn't start at seven . [we] [have] um at seven o'clock [we] [just] [have] um [the] they'll play [you] [know] [they have] old reruns [of] cheers or something from seven [to] seven thirty [and] then something else from seven thirty [to] eight 
B|96| M:  
A|97| A: [and] ours start at at at at eight [and] end at eleven [that's] why [we] . [i] [i] would actually like [it] better if everything started at seven [and] ended at ten . 
B|98| M: [how] [do] [we] could'a [and i] 
A|99| A: oh [that's] great . 
B|100| M: [that's] 
A|101| A: oh [all] [the] [time] . [do you] watch cheers 
B|102| M: [what] [is] [it] ? 
A|103| A: [it's] at [that] [was] actually [a] big dilemma for me now because um cheers cheers [and] twin peaks [are] now [on [the] same] [time]
