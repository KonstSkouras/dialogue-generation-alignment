B|44| M: [not] ahem 
A|45| A: [i think] _so_ _, [i_ think] because _people_ sort [of] get through , [you] [know] , um _, [i_ think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn [the] importance [of] sort [of] physical fitness as well as [the] , as well as , [you] [know] , _some_ mental fitness [and] [i think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn _good_ sportsmanship [and] _so_ forth . 
B|46| M: [you] 
A|47| A: well , [don't] _they_ take _people who _have_ some_ sort [of] , um , big abilities like [and , and] at least _they_ used [to] when [it ,] when [it ,] [the first] ones [i] saw _they_ _had_ , um , [a] man [on] _who_ [was] , uh , _he_ played college football [and] almost went pro [, and] _they_ _had a_ , [a] woman _who_ [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] [the] , uh , she [was] [in the] junior olympics or something or _they_ seem [to] [have] _people who have_ very , very big sports backgrounds . [to] [have] _they_ , leaned away from [that] sort [of] , 
B|48| M: [what] . lol 
A|49| A: oh [, that's] _how_ _they_ _do it ._ 
B|50| M: [i] 
A|51| A: _really_ ? 
B|52| M: [so] . 
A|53| A: yeah , okay _, i_ [just] thought _they_ _had_ _some_ , 
B|54| M: they're [just] making [a] joke . 
A|55| A: yeah _, i_ thought _they_ _had_ _some_ sort [of] _, [i_ mean] _, i_ thought _they_ were [just] poor _people_ like us [i] guess [not] [, that's] great . 
B|56| M: they're pretty [good] . 
A|57| A: [but] , maybe i'll try [it] one [day .] i'll get [on] there one [day] [and] see if [i] can , uh , um , [what] , [what do] _they_ win , _they_ , _they_ win _money_ [i think] , [don't] _they_ ? 
B|58| M: [not] much [, but] _they [have_ some] 
A|59| A: _really_ ? 
B|60| M: [there's a lot of] [people who have] [a lot] more [money] than [i] [do] . 
A|61| A: wow . _all_ [that] for getting tennis balls shot at [you] at [a] hundred miles an hour . 
B|62| M: [how] much ? 
A|63| A: one [little] ball here [and] there , yeah [, and] [this] guy's beating [you] up , [so] _, [i_ [don't] know] [the] beating up part . _i _,_ i_ actually feel [the] tennis balls would hurt . 
B|64| M: [i think] [he] [was] [just] making [a] joke . 
A|65| A: [they] look like , yeah , [they] seem like [a] tennis ball [but] [it] almost doesn't look like [it's] almost livable yeah , [the best] _i _,_ [i_ don't] [think] [i] could _, i _,_ i_ could handle those tennis balls . [so] , [what] else [to] [you tape] besides american at , there anything else ? 
B|66| M: [this] 
A|67| A: _huh ?_ 
B|68| M: we're 
A|69| A: okay .

A|77| A: uh-huh . oh , okay , well , [they] seem [to be on] later , 
B|78| M: [that's] [not] [really] [the] case [, i've] never [had a] case [in] which [the] defendant [was] [not] involved . 
A|79| A: _all_ , always _right_ _, right_ before [the news] [is] when [i] catch them . _i _,_ i_ tend [to] , if nothing else [is] [in the] town television at eleven o'clock [just] [to] watch [the news [,] and] or , or nightline or something , [just] sort [of] get [a] [good] , [you] [know] , [a] [good] , [a] [good] [think] for [the day .] 
B|80| M: uhm .

A|85| A: yeah , ours [is] [on] , 
B|86| M: [we are] [all] [in _the] same_ place [, right] ? 
A|87| A: actually [it ,] ours [is] [on] at eleven [it [,] it's] , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here [in new] york . um _, [i_ think] [they] [they] [do] [that _,] [i_ think] [they] put things [on] at , um , eleven o'clock here [and] [i think] [they] put [it] like eleven o'clock , um , california [time] , like [in] california [but] [in the middle] [they] sort [of] , um , like central [time] or mountain [time] [they] , [they] push things back . [so] _, [i_ was] actually , actually [i'm] [not] sure _, [i_ was] [in] _, [i_ was] [in] iowa awhile ago [, and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier , [so] , does [your] prime [time] start at seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M:  
A|89| A: wait , [no] , [no] , 
B|90| M: [i] ... 
A|91| A: [not] , [not] even [the news] [but] [do] [they have] like , um , [do] like sort [of] [all] [the] regular sitcoms [and] [so] forth , start at seven o'clock ? [you ,] [so] , like , [you] [know] , [the] regular television shows [that] [are] , [that] [are] very popular , [do] [they] start at , seven or , or at eight ? 
B|92| M:  
A|93| A: [right] , because [that] would [the] eight o'clock here . 
B|94| M: [it's] [the] [show .] 
A|95| A: yeah , [that ,] [that] would [all] start at , at , um , [that] would [all] start at , at eight o'clock here , [that] wouldn't start at seven . [we] [have ,] um , at seven o'clock [we] [just] [have ,] um , [the] , they'll play , [you] [know] , [they have] old reruns [of] cheers or something from seven [to] seven thirty [, and] then something else from seven thirty [to] eight 
B|96| M:  
A|97| A: [and] ours start at , at , at , at eight [and] end at eleven [, that's] why [we] . _i _,_ i_ would actually like [it] better if everything started at seven [and] ended at ten . 
B|98| M: [how] [do] [we] could'a [, [and] [,] i ,] 
A|99| A: oh [, that's] great . 
B|100| M: [that's] 
A|101| A: oh , [all] [the] [time] . [do you] watch cheers 
B|102| M: [what] [is] [it] ? 
A|103| A: [it's] at , [that] [was] actually [a] big dilemma for me now because , um , cheers , cheers [and] twin peaks [are] now [on [the] same] [time] ,
