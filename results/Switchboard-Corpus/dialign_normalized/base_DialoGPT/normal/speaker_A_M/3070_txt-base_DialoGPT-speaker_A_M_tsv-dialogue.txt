B|61| M: [that's] [the catholic] [version of] [it] [, not] [the] catholian [version] . 
A|62| A: _it was_ , _it was_ an interesting theory . she talked about [the] [, uh ,] [the] catholics all [, it's a] [home] centered , _you know [,_ it's] all family centered anyway , [so] [you] usually [are] living where [your] parents live [and] [it's] all [, your] , [you] [don't] [have] [to] come [home] , [so] [the] catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older europe , [but] when [the] protestant ethic happened [in] america , there [were] people [who] [ever] went out [and ,] _you know ,_ went away from [the] family [to] seek their fortune _, and_ then had [to] come back [home] [for] their _reunion ,_ [so] [that] , became their [version [of] the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| A: [but] she had , _it was_ interesting , _you [know [,_ [i] don't] know] how valid [it] [is] , [but] she talked about [that] [and] how [the] , [the] big picnic table [was] [the] symbolic communion [of the] people gathering together _, [and_ ,] [um ,] _you know ,_ about [the] [bread] [and] [the] ritual placement . do [you] [have a] , [a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed out on [the] table [every] , [every] year ?

A|82| A: [right] 
B|83| M: _no_ . [it was] [a] joke . 
A|84| A: [have] [you] , [have] [you] done [this] repetitively , [or] [just] once ? 
B|85| M: [right] [, and] 
A|86| A: [oh .] 
B|87| M: [i] think [it was] 
A|88| A: see [, that's] [we've] [we] had [a] problem with [that] . 
B|89| M: [we] 
A|90| A: [oh .] 
B|91| M: he died [in _the] second_ half [of _the] first_ season . 
A|92| A: [right .] [that's] our , [was] our problem . [we] had [, uh ,] [the first] _reunion ,_ [or] [the first] , _you know ,_ major _reunion_ [was] probably six [or] seven [years] ago . 
B|93| M: [i] [, uh ,] [what] ? 
A|94| A: [and] then _the second reunion ,_ people [who] maybe , _you know ,_ had sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first] [one] thought , [oh] , [well , [it's] not] [that] big _a thing_ [this] year , 
B|95| M: [the second reunion [,] uh ,] [what] ? 
A|96| A: [and] [so] [it] kind [of] wound down , 
B|97| M: [but] [it's] still [not] [a thing] , [right] ? 
A|98| A: [and] then finally , _you know , you're_ lucky [to] get , _you know ,_ [you] get [the] shreveport relatives there , [but] [no] [one] else [so] [that] , 
B|99| M: [you know , you're] [not] wrong .
