B|61| M: [that's] [the catholic] [version of] [it] [not] [the] catholian [version] . 
A|62| A: _it was_ _it was_ an interesting theory . she talked about [the] [uh] [the] catholics all [it's a] [home] centered _you know_ [it's] all family centered anyway [so] [you] usually [are] living where [your] parents live [and] [it's] all [your] [you] [don't] [have] [to] come [home] [so] [the] catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older europe [but] when [the] protestant ethic happened [in] america there [were] people [who] [ever] went out [and] _you know_ went away from [the] family [to] seek their fortune [and] then had [to] come back [home] [for] their _reunion_ [so] [that] became their [version [of] the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| A: [but] she had _it was_ interesting _you [know_ [i] don't know] how valid [it] [is] [but] she talked about [that] [and] how [the] [the] big picnic table [was] [the] symbolic communion [of the] people gathering together [and] [um] _you know_ about [the] [bread] [and] [the] ritual placement . do [you] [have a] [a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed out on [the] table [every] [every] year ? [is] there kind [of] [a] _you know_ salads go _first_ [and] things [like that] ?

A|84| A: [have] [you] [have] [you] done [this] repetitively [or] [just] once ? 
B|85| M: [right] [and] 
A|86| A: [oh .] 
B|87| M: [i] think [it was] 
A|88| A: see [that's] [we've] [we] had [a] problem with [that] . 
B|89| M: [we] 
A|90| A: [oh .] 
B|91| M: he died [in _the] second_ half [of _the] first_ season . 
A|92| A: [right .] [that's] our [was] our problem . [we] had [uh] [the first] _reunion_ [or] [the first] _you know_ major _reunion_ [was] probably six [or] seven [years] ago . 
B|93| M: [i] [uh] [what] ? 
A|94| A: [and] then _the second reunion_ people [who] maybe _you know_ had sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first] [one] thought [oh] [well [it's] not] [that] big _a thing_ [this] year 
B|95| M: [the second reunion] [uh] [what] ? 
A|96| A: [and] [so] [it] kind [of] wound down 
B|97| M: [but] [it's] still [not] [a thing] [right] ? 
A|98| A: [and] then finally _you know you're_ lucky [to] get _you know_ [you] get [the] shreveport relatives there [but] [no] [one] else [so] [that] 
B|99| M: [you know you're] [not] wrong .
