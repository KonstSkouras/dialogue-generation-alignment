B|0| M: um i'm _not_ _really_ sure _but it's_ an _interesting_ question . 
A|1| A: and uh _they_ had basically decided _that_ there _is_ going _to_ be _a_ real problem here within _a_ few years on solid waste . 
B|2| M: umm ... _i_ think that's [a] myth . 
A|3| A: well [it's] [not] too _new_ . 
B|4| M: _i_ mean _it_ [is] [new] 
A|5| A: oh _they_ [really] didn't propose any solutions . actually _they_ were _the_ guy was pretty negative about _the_ things _that_ _the_ government was doing _even_ though he was from _the_ e p [a] . 
B|6| M: that's _what_ [they] _want_ _you_ [to] think . 
A|7| A: [but] he had [a] lot of uh facts [to] [to] give and uh things like _how_ many solid waste plants were being shut down and and uh one of _the_ most [interesting] things _that_ he was talking about was recycling of of news print . he was talking about uh _the_ city of [new] york and _how_ [they] went and collected all this news print 
B|8| M: i'morry 
A|9| A: and [they] could sell [it] for [a] while . [they] were able [to] sell [it] for some amount per ton and now at this stage of _the_ game where [they] have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print _that_ [they] have [to] pay [to] have [it] hauled away . 
B|10| M: [the] money 
A|11| A: _yeah_ . we're doing some here in in cash valley [the] community here . 
B|12| M:  . 
A|13| A: there's uh we've actually got [a] kind of [a] nice set up . we've got [a] couple of plants here _that_ actually take uh recycled paper and shred [it] and spray [it] with chemical treatment so _that_ [it's] [not] [a] fire hazard and make [it] into insulation 
B|14| M: c' ? 
A|15| A: and [they] can actually use as much recycled paper as [the] community can _get_ [to] them . because [they] are actually buying [it] and shipping [it] in from outside . 
B|16| M: [but] [they] _can't_ [get] [it] _back_ . 
A|17| A: so one of [the] real keys [it] sounds like [to] getting recycling for uh paper or something like _that_ [to] go [is] [to] [get] some sort of business [to] actually [want] [it] once [you] have collected [it] . 
B|18| M: i'm interested 
A|19| A: uh-huh . 
B|20| M: u ? 
A|21| A: and there was [a] paper presented at this conference from [a] guy from alabama and he was kind of hired [to] do [a] study by two departments for [the] government . one was like environmental protection and [the] other one was oh [i] [can't] remember [what] [but] [the] basic idea [it] was presented [to] him was _how_ can we maximize [the] amount of energy _that_ we can [get] [back] from recycling and minimize [the] volume of stuff _that_ we are putting into our landfill 
B|22| M: [the] recycle recycle 
A|23| A: and uh [the] solution _that_ he came up with for plastics and [it] was [really] quite amazing he says well [the] best thing [to] do with plastics [is] [to] burn them . 
B|24| M:  ... 
A|25| A: he came [to] [the] conclusion plastics [is] actually one of [the] biggest problems in landfills cause [it's] [it's] low weight [but it's] high volume so [it] takes up [a] lot of space 
B|26| M: [i] hate 
A|27| A: and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing [a] lot of [the] recycling [but] there [is] [a] lot of energy in [it] if [you] can burn [it] and use [it] produce electricity . 
B|28| M: i'msigh 
A|29| A: so his solution was [to] burn plastic . collect [it] and burn [it] . 
B|30| M: why ? what's [the] point ? 
A|31| A: _yeah_ . and [it's] more than _even_ paper or something like _that_ . there [is] more energy in [it] per pound or whatever . well _that_ was he didn't deal with _that_ . 
B|32| M: carbon fuel 
A|33| A: he just said burn [it] . 
B|34| M: [how] [is] [that] [even] possible ? 
A|35| A: he didn't talk about cleaning [it] up or anything like [that] . so [it's] [not] very practical 
B|36| M: [yeah] [but] what's [the] point ? 
A|37| A: [yeah] well real [interesting] . 
B|38| M: [you] don't know [how] [it] works ? 
A|39| A: uh [not] too much . uh [i] got [a] bit . actually
