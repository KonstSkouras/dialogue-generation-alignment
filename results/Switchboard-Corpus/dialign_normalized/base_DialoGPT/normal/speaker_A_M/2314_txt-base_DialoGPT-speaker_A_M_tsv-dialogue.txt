A|9| A: _do you_ feel like _that's_ an invasion of certain people's rights if _not_ everyone _is_ _tested ?_ 
B|10| M: _it's not_ . 
A|11| A: [i don't] [know] _that_ _you _do_ ._ if _it's random_ then _it's random_

B|16| M: [do _you] know_ _the_ difference between [random] [and] _random ._ org ? 
A|17| A: [yeah] . well [i] [i know] _that_ _for_ instance _in_ [the] n c double _a_ _they_ _drug_ _test_ [and] [it's not] [random .] 
B|18| M: [it's [random] .] 
A|19| A: [uh] well _i think_ _all_ college players _have to_ [do] an initial _drug_ _test_ at _a_ certain point prior _to_ [the] season 
B|20| M: _i don't think_ 
A|21| A: [and] from _that_ point _on_ [uh] at [the] n c double _a_ _does_ _have_ something _to_ [do] with [it] but [it's] almost discretionary _on_ [the] coach's part of each individual institution _to_ identify [the] ones _that_ _have_ [the] _problem ._ 
B|22| M: [it] 
A|23| A: _and and_ [the] ones _that_ _test_ positive _have to_ retest after _a_ certain period of time . 
B|24| M: [and [and] and] 
A|25| A: well [not] being _a drug_ user [i don't] _have_ _a problem_ with _that_ personally 
B|26| M: i'm serious . 
A|27| A: but _i think_ _that_ might _be_ _a_ violation of someone's rights . if someone's having personal problems _for_ some reason [that's] causing _them_ _to_ behave differently 
B|28| M: _it's [a_ drug] _use_ [test] 
A|29| A: [and] their manager assumes _they_ _have_ [a drug] _problem_ [i] _mean_ if someone assumed _that_ of _me_ [i] _would_ _be_ upset . 
B|30| M: [they] [do .] 
A|31| A: [it's] an accusation [and and] [it's] [and] [it's] based _on_ _on_ [a] perception _that_ someone has as [how] [a drug] user _would_ behave when some [drug] users behave [uh] normal [uh] [you know .] 
B|32| M: [what] [does] [that] even [mean] ? 
A|33| A: right exactly . [i] [i don't] [the] _i think_ almost [the] only way [that] [drug] _testing_ can _be_ done fairly _is_ if [it's] across [the] board from from [the] janitors _to_ [the] executive management . 
B|34| M: [that] 
A|35| A: [what] type of _job_ [do you] _have_ ? 
B|36| M: [it] . 
A|37| A: uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [that's] _the job_ . 
A|39| A: well [does] your [does] your [job] require [you] _to_ _drive_ company equipment _or_ _to_ operate any type of machinery [that] might endanger someone ? 
B|40| M: _i have_ never _had_ _to work_ [in] [a] [job] [that] required [me] [to] [be] _drug tested_ . 
A|41| A: well [that] doesn't [i] [mean] [i] ... 
B|42| M: i've been told _to not_ [drive] [a] car [for] several years _now_ . 
A|43| A: uh-huh . 
B|44| M: why [is] [it] illegal ? 
A|45| A: [that] [is] odd . [i] _was_ [drug tested] [uh] [not] [for] [the job] [i have] [now] but [for] [the] prior [job] [uh] but [i know] [that] [they] sent [that] [the job] [i] [had] before [that] well [the job] [i have] [have] [now] requested my [uh uh] my [uh] medical record from my old company 
B|46| M: [what] _are_ [you] [on] [about] ? 
A|47| A: so [i don't] [know] if [i] wasn't [drug tested] based [on] [that] _or_ because [the] man who hired [me] didn't request [the] [drug] [test] because [i know] [that] my company [does] [drug] _testing_ [on] occasion . 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: well _no [i_ don't _think] they_ can [they] can force another company [to not] [drug] [test] [me] [just] by saying [that] [i] [i] didn't [i] [mean] 
B|50| M: yes ?? 
A|51| A: [they] [don't] [know] [that] [i don't] [use] drugs . [they] [just] [tested] [me] once . 
B|52| M: [drug tested] . 
A|53| A: but [i] used [to work] [for] [a] power company so _it was_ very important [that] [they] make sure their employees especially linemen [uh] were clean . 
B|54| M: [i [think] they] [would] [have to] give [you] [a] [test] [no] ? 
A|55| A: [and] since [i] _was_ [just] [you know] one of [the] office folk [i] guess [it] wasn't as important [to] _them_ [that] [they] [test] [me] regularly . but [i know] [they] [test] most of [the] service people fairly regularly [uh] [just] across [the] board . 
B|56| M: uhhhuh . [uh] 
A|57| A: [no] _they're_ _all_ of _them_ [are] [tested] once every three 
B|58| M: [are] [they] [all] [tested ?] 
A|59| A: [it's a] rotation . 
B|60| M: [it's a] [test] . 
A|61| A: but [it] but again [it] depends [on] [what] [job] you're [in] . 
B|62| M: [it's not] [it's a] good [job] . 
A|63| A: _the men_ [that] [are] out there fixing power lines [are] [tested] [a] lot [and] _the men_ [that] [drive] [the] trucks with with [the] guys [that] fix [the] power lines aren't [tested] as much . 
B|64| M: [they're] [testing] [the men] . 
A|65| A: but but see [they] make [that] clear [to] _them_ as [they] hire those guys [what] [what] [the] [drug] [testing] schedule [is] . 
B|66| M: [and that's] why i'm surprised [they're] [hiring] [them] . 
A|67| A: [they] say we we're [testing] [you] tomorrow [and] we'll [test] [you] every three months thereafter while [you] [work] here . 
B|68| M: [i [know] .] 
A|69| A: [yeah] [it's] [it's] made very clear upon [hiring] . 
B|70| M: [is] [that] [how] [they] [are] ? 
A|71| A: well [have] we spent our at least five minutes ? 
B|72| M: oh ? you've seen anything ? 
A|73| A: okay . 
B|74| M: yes [it's not] [a [problem] .] 
A|75| A: okay . 
B|76| M: [no [i] think] [it was] six [or] seven . 
A|77| A: nice talking [to] [you] . bye-bye
