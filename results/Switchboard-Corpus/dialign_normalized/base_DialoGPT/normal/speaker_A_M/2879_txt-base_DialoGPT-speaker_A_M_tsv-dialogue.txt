B|26| M: er , 
A|27| A: [i] mean _i don't_ _like_ guns _in_ general _but_ when [i think] [about [,] uh ,] _this_ topic _like_ capital punishment [i] look at somebody [, i] mean [, i] _just_ remember when [i] was _in_ college _in_ _a_ dorm [and [i] think] _if_ he'd been around one [of] my family members probably _would_ _have_ killed him _but_ _in_ florida , _in _the_ state of_ washington when _they_ had [the] ted bundy case 
B|28| M: [i] 
A|29| A: [and] _how_ _they_ _just_ well , [it] hasn't been _just_ _but_ [it] was _in the_ [, i think] [the] second or third quarter [of] last _year_ , nineteen ninety 
B|30| M: [the] [year] [before] ? 
A|31| A: [and i] had _, you_ [know [,] i] knew some people [that] said , why are [you] glad _, you_ [you] [know ,] _this_ [is] nothing [, [and] i] said _just_ maybe [because] he got _a_ lot [of] media hype [and] all [that] _but_ [i] actually [, i] mean _in_ there should _be_ more cases _like_ [that] where _they_ flip _a_ [i] might _be_ too cold too _, but_ _they_ flip _a_ switch ,

B|36| M: [that's , like] , your opinion , _man_ . 
A|37| A: _so many times_ . 
B|38| M: [and] [so many times] 
A|39| A: yeah . 
B|40| M: [oh] . 
A|41| A: yeah [, i] mean [, and] [that's] _just_ maybe [because] [of the] little more , _they_ said celebrated [that [,] uh ,] he's [not] _the only_ one _, you_ [know ,] 
B|42| M: [i know .] 
A|43| A: _you , you_ see somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear [about] somebody's crime , there was something _on_ [, and] _this_ gets back _to_ capital punishment _, but_ [the] [man] had stolen [, uh ,] [not] stolen _but_ kidnapped [, uh ,] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere _in_ florida [and] _they_ changed all [the] facts [that] _they_ said [it] was true 
B|44| M: wait , [so] [they] found [out] [about] [it] ? 
A|45| A: [and] [they] buried her alive 
B|46| M: [and the] murder 
A|47| A: [and] peter strauss had played [the] lead role [and the] [man] [, and] [, and] at [the] end _of _,_ you_ [know] _how_ [they] [have] these mini dramas , at [the] end [they] said , _this_ set person was paroled [like] six months ago [and] _you're_ thinking [oh] , [that's] nice . 
B|48| M: [it's] [good] 
A|49| A: [i] mean _, you_ [know [,] _i'm not] sure_ [that] capital punishment serves as _a_ deterrence _but_ [it] does serve as _a_ [uh ,] definite _, you_ [know ,] lasting 
B|50| M: i've never heard [that] [before] . i'll [have] [to] [check] [it] [out] . 
A|51| A: right , _in_ [that] particular instance [, uh _,] but_ [i _,] but_ _i don't_ _, but_ _i know it's_ _on_ _a_ [and] all [and] _be_ all , 
B|52| M: ahaaaaaaayyyy . 
A|53| A: [that's] [the] _problem_ [i have] with [it] , _in_ texas [they] _think it's_ [and] all [and] _be_ all , [they] [think] [that] _if they_ electrocute or slip , or [do] something , or gas somebody [, uh [,] that] they're [not] _going_ [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] _they do_ [have] [and] _we_ happen [to] _live in_ dallas which [is] extremely crime , ridden , 
B|54| M:  
A|55| A: [and] _we_ _just_ moved _here_ [, uh ,] we've been _here_ [before] , lived _in_ minneapolis , saint paul [, uh ,] which has an exceedingly low crime rate [, and] then _we_ were transferred back _here_ [, and] when _you're_ gone from some place [like] [it] for [about] six years as _we_ were _, you_ really begin [to] see [, uh ,] _just_ _how_ problematic _just_ living [is] , _even_ suburban , [no] matter where [you] are , 
B|56| M: [now ,] 
A|57| A: [and] _how_ , _you're_ _in_ , [rome] , [new york] , 
B|58| M: [you] . 
A|59| A: _is that_ [and] [, and] _, is that_ [like] near albany or syracuse , 
B|60| M: _so [,_ is that] [a] question ? 
A|61| A: [what] , [what] type [of] _area_ [is [that] ,] 
B|62| M: [i] [live [in] the] middle [of] nowhere _, uh , and_ [uh [,] _i'm not] even_ [, uh] 
A|63| A: [is that] [in] term , 
B|64| M: [i'm] [in the] [area] 
A|65| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|66| M: [i don't know] what's [going] [on] [in this] picture [but] [it's] hilarious 
A|67| A: _sure_ . 
B|68| M: [i know [it's] a] joke [, but] [it's] still funny 
A|69| A: _how_ _would_ , _how_ [is the] situation [in] there [in] terms [of] crime [and] [, and] things [that] _would_ , 
B|70| M: [they do] . 
A|71| A: [not] too _bad_ . yeah . uh-huh . 
B|72| M: [how] [bad] ? 
A|73| A: [not] [the] harsh criminality [, that] [you] find [in] , 
B|74| M: _i can't_ _. _i_ can't_ [be] bothered [to] ,,, 
A|75| A: yeah , [now ,] dallas _is a_ [i'm] _being_ very sarcastic , _it's just_ [a] great [, uh ,] [on] some days [, uh ,] [it's] [, [uh _,] i] don't know_ [the] [good] ole boy network _here_ [is] [, uh ,] very strange [, like] [i] said [they] believe [that ,] _if they_ kill somebody _, you_ [know ,] tit for tat [and] , deed for deed [that [,] that] does something [, uh ,] 
B|76| M:  
A|77| A: [but] yet [they] want spend [the] _money_ [to] build [the] [new] jails [that [,] i] mean , [they] really are over , crowded , 
B|78| M: [money] [is] _their_ , [money] , [money] . 
A|79| A: [i] mean , [that's ,] [that's] _just_ [not] [a] cop [out] [, uh , [and] i] _just_ _, you_ [know [,] i'm] originally from pennsylvania which [i think] [is] basically [like] [new york] these days [, _i'm not] sure_ _if they_ _, i don't_ [think] [they] [have] capital punishment there . 
B|80| M: [you're] [, like] [, but ,] 
A|81| A: uh-huh . yeah [, and] [i'm] from _pittsburgh_ [so ,] [oh] , well , we'll forgive each other 
B|82| M: [you , [you] ,] uhhhh ... 
A|83| A: [uh [,] because] [they] use [to] [be] very , very conservative when [i] was growing up [i] [and [i] can't] [, i] haven't lived there [in] twenty , years 
B|84| M: uu ' 
A|85| A: [but [,] uh ,]

B|88| M: [i] [live [in] the] west part [, the] east [is] [like] [, i think] . 
A|89| A: [but [,] [uh _,] i] don't know_ [i think] everybody _would feel_ [it is] _same_ way _if they_ were _touched_ by crime [. _i] think everyone_ _would_ [, you] [and [i] think] are honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do it_ [on] , [in this] , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|90| M: [i'm not sure] [i'm] understanding [the] question 
A|91| A: [but] [i think] everybody _if they_ were _touched_ by [it] _would_ _say_ , _if they_ had _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought [out] [, i think] every human does [, i think] they'd _say_ , yeah , 
B|92| M: [i think everyone] [here] [would feel] [the] [same] [if they] [touched] 
A|93| A: _do it_ [if] somebody [in] my family or [if] [it] happened [it] _me_ [, you] [know ,] 
B|94| M: [i think it's] okay [if] [you] [do it] 
A|95| A: [uh ,] 
B|96| M: [no , i] am _not ,_ 
A|97| A: uh-huh . yeah [, i] _just_ , [don't] [think] [that [,] uh [,] [you] can] rehabilitate [, i] mean [i] _just_ [don't] [, uh ,] [oh] [, i] did [a] paper back [in] college [a] long [time] ago for criminal justice class [, [and] i] _just_ [, the] subject [, i] remember [we] drew things [out] [of] [a] hat [and] [it] was something [, uh ,] [it] was basically [the] essence was does [the] crime fit [the] punishment [and] when [you] see [how] [many] repeat offenders there are [, uh ,] [check] , [check] fraud cases where [they] go [to] jail for five [to] ten years [and] [, uh ,] rape , rapist getting [their] hand , _just_ slapped [, you] [know [,] and] [how] [it is] based [on] [the] judge [and] [if] [the] [time] [of] day [that] [the] court [is] [in] session [, you] [know ,] all these [, uh ,] intangible things 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: [and] [you're] thinking , [oh] [, you] [would] [not] _only_ [would] [you] [not] want [to] [be] [a] victim [you] wouldn't want [to] [be] [a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't _know what_ [you're] getting [, uh]

B|108| M: [it's just] [the state of] [being] , _isn't_ [it] ? 
A|109| A: [isn't] [that] correct . 
B|110| M: [the only] thing [that] [is [a] problem] [is the] us .
