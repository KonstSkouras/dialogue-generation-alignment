A|25| A: uh-huh . right they're _no_ [the] cattiness behind right yeah 
B|26| M: er 
A|27| A: [i] mean _i don't_ _like_ guns _in_ general _but_ when [i think about] [uh] _this_ topic _like_ capital punishment [i] look at somebody [i] mean [i] _just_ remember when [i] was _in_ college _in_ _a_ dorm [and [i] think] _if_ he'd been around one [of] my family members probably _would_ _have_ killed him _but_ _in_ florida _in _the_ state of_ washington when _they_ had [the] ted bundy case 
B|28| M: [i] 
A|29| A: [and] _how_ _they_ _just_ well [it] hasn't been _just_ _but_ [it] was _in the_ [i think] [the] second or third quarter [of] last _year_ nineteen ninety 
B|30| M: [the] [year] [before] ? 
A|31| A: [and i] had [you] [know] [i] knew some people [that] said why are [you] glad _you you_ [know] _this_ [is] nothing [and i] said _just_ maybe [because] he got _a_ lot [of] media hype [and] all [that] _but_ [i] actually [i] mean _in_ there should _be_ more cases _like_ [that] where _they_ flip _a_ [i] might _be_ too cold too _but_ _they_ flip _a_ switch 
B|32| M: [i] 
A|33| A: _i don't know_

B|38| M: [and] [so many times] 
A|39| A: yeah . 
B|40| M: [oh] . 
A|41| A: yeah [i] mean [and] [that's] _just_ maybe [because] [of the] little more _they_ said celebrated [that] [uh] he's [not] _the only_ one [you] [know] 
B|42| M: [i know .] 
A|43| A: _you you_ see somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear [about] somebody's crime there was something _on_ [and] _this_ gets back _to_ capital punishment _but_ [the] [man] had stolen [uh] [not] stolen _but_ kidnapped [uh] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere _in_ florida [and] _they_ changed all [the] facts [that] _they_ said [it] was true 
B|44| M: wait [so] [they] found [out] [about] [it] ? 
A|45| A: [and] [they] buried her alive 
B|46| M: [and the] murder 
A|47| A: [and] peter strauss had played [the] lead role [and the] [man] [and] [and] at [the] end [of] [you] [know] _how_ [they] [have] these mini dramas at [the] end [they] said _this_ set person was paroled [like] six months ago [and] _you're_ thinking [oh] [that's] nice . 
B|48| M: [it's] [good] 
A|49| A: [i] mean [you] [know] _i'm not sure_ [that] capital punishment serves as _a_ deterrence _but_ [it] does serve as _a_ [uh] definite [you] [know] lasting 
B|50| M: i've never heard [that] [before] . i'll [have] [to] [check] [it] [out] . 
A|51| A: right _in_ [that] particular instance [uh] _but_ [i] _but_ _i don't_ _but_ _i know it's_ _on_ _a_ [and] all [and] _be_ all 
B|52| M: ahaaaaaaayyyy . 
A|53| A: [that's] [the] _problem_ [i have] with [it] _in_ texas [they] _think it's_ [and] all [and] _be_ all [they] [think] [that] _if they_ electrocute or slip or [do] something or gas somebody [uh] [that] they're [not] _going_ [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] _they do_ [have] [and] _we_ happen [to] _live in_ dallas which [is] extremely crime ridden 
B|54| M:  
A|55| A: [and] _we_ _just_ moved _here_ [uh] we've been _here_ [before] lived _in_ minneapolis saint paul [uh] which has an exceedingly low crime rate [and] then _we_ were transferred back _here_ [and] when _you're_ gone from some place [like] [it] for [about] six years as _we_ were [you] really begin [to] see [uh] _just_ _how_ problematic _just_ living [is] _even_ suburban [no] matter where [you] are 
B|56| M: [now] 
A|57| A: [and] _how_ _you're_ _in_ [rome] [new york] 
B|58| M: [you] . 
A|59| A: _is [that_ and] [and] _is that_ [like] near albany or syracuse 
B|60| M: [so] [is that] [a] question ? 
A|61| A: [what] [what] type [of] _area_ [is that] 
B|62| M: [i] [live [in] the] middle [of] nowhere _uh _and_ uh_ _i'm not even_ [uh] 
A|63| A: [is that] [in] term 
B|64| M: [i'm] [in the] [area] 
A|65| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|66| M: [i don't know] what's [going] _on in this_ picture [but] [it's] hilarious 
A|67| A: _sure_ . 
B|68| M: [i know [it's] a] joke [but] [it's] still funny 
A|69| A: _how_ _would_ _how_ [is the] situation [in] there [in] terms [of] crime [and] [and] things [that] _would_ 
B|70| M: [they do] . 
A|71| A: [not] too _bad_ . yeah . uh-huh . 
B|72| M: [how] [bad] ? 
A|73| A: [not] [the] harsh criminality [that] [you] find [in] 
B|74| M: _i can't_ _. _i_ can't_ [be] bothered [to] 
A|75| A: yeah [now] dallas _is a_ [i'm] _being_ very sarcastic _it's just_ [a] great [uh] [on] some days [uh] [it's] [uh [i] don't know] [the] [good] ole boy network _here_ [is] [uh] very strange _like i_ said [they] believe [that] _if they_ kill somebody [you] [know] tit for tat [and] deed for deed [that] [that] does something [uh] 
B|76| M:  
A|77| A: [but] yet [they] want spend [the] _money_ [to] build [the] [new] jails [that] [i] mean [they] really are over crowded 
B|78| M: [money] [is] _their_ [money] [money] . 
A|79| A: [i] mean [that's] [that's] _just_ [not] [a] cop [out] [uh [and] i] _just_ [you] [know] [i'm] originally from pennsylvania which [i think] [is] basically [like] [new york] these days _i'm not sure_ _if they_ [i don't] [think] [they] [have] capital punishment there . 
B|80| M: [you're] [like] [but] 
A|81| A: uh-huh . yeah [and] [i'm] from _pittsburgh_ [so] [oh] well we'll forgive each other 
B|82| M: [you you] uhhhh ... 
A|83| A: [uh] [because] [they] use [to] [be] very very conservative when [i] was growing up [i] [and [i] can't] [i] haven't lived there [in] twenty years 
B|84| M: uu ' 
A|85| A: [but] [uh] 
B|86| M: [it's] ok [we] [can] [live in] [pittsburgh] 
A|87| A: there [you] go [i don't know] [that's] [a] different subject altogether 
B|88| M: [i] [live [in] the] west part [the] east [is] [like [i] think] . 
A|89| A: [but] [uh [i] don't know] [i think] everybody _would feel_ [it is] _same_ way _if they_ were _touched_ by crime [. _i] think everyone_ _would_ [you] [and [i] think] are honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do it_ [on in this] vehicle [uh] 
B|90| M: [i'm not sure] [i'm] understanding [the] question 
A|91| A: [but] [i think] everybody _if they_ were _touched_ by [it] _would_ _say_ _if they_ had _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought [out] [i think] every human does [i think] they'd _say_ yeah 
B|92| M: [i think everyone] [here] [would feel] [the] [same] [if they] [touched] 
A|93| A: _do it_ [if] somebody [in] my family or [if] [it] happened [it] _me_ [you] [know] 
B|94| M: [i think it's] okay [if] [you] [do it] 
A|95| A: [uh] 
B|96| M: [no i] am [not] 
A|97| A: uh-huh . yeah [i] _just_ [don't] [think] [that] [uh] [you can] rehabilitate [i] mean [i] _just_ [don't] [uh] [oh] [i] did [a] paper back [in] college [a] long [time] ago for criminal justice class [and i] _just the_ subject [i] remember [we] drew things [out] [of] [a] hat [and] [it] was something [uh] [it] was basically [the] essence was does [the] crime fit [the] punishment [and] when [you] see [how] [many] repeat offenders there are [uh] [check] [check] fraud cases where [they] go [to] jail for five [to] ten years [and uh] rape rapist getting [their] hand _just_ slapped [you] [know] [and] [how] [it is] based [on] [the] judge [and] [if] [the] [time] [of] day [that] [the] court [is] [in] session [you] [know] all these [uh] intangible things 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: [and] [you're] thinking [oh] [you] [would] [not] _only_ [would] [you] [not] want [to] [be] [a] victim [you] wouldn't want [to] [be] [a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't _know what_ [you're] getting [uh] 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: [but] [i don't know] methods [of] capital punishment [i have no] opinions [on] [that] either [i] _just_ 
B|102| M: [you] 
A|103| A: uh-huh [. is] [it] [uh] [how] [about] [the] injection 
B|104| M: [i _don't] have_ [any] ideas [i] [can] [you think] [of] u [do] u 
A|105| A: [is that] suppose [to] [be] . 
B|106| M: [i'm] sorry 
A|107| A: yeah . [i'm not even] [sure] [in the] split among [the] fifty states [do you] [know] which way [it is the] ratio [it's] more than aren't [uh] [it's] more [that] [don't have] [it] 
B|108| M: [it's [just] [the] state of] [being] _isn't_ [it] ? 
A|109| A: [isn't] [that] correct . 
B|110| M: [the only] thing [that] [is [a] problem] [is the] us . 
A|111| A: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|112| M: [what] ? [you] [can't] tell [me] [what] [to] [do] [i don't [know] what] [to] [say] . 
A|113| A: yeah [i don't know] [if] they've [they] did something [about] [i'm not sure] [if] texas minnesota [i] [they] didn't [they] didn't [they] were well did [they] [have] [it] [they] were against [it] [uh] texas as [i] said has [it] [but] [i] haven't been back [here] long enough [to] [to] realize whether or [not] [if] they've done [it] [in the] last
