B|0| M: _how_ _do_ _you_ _think it would_ work ? 
A|1| B: yeah yeah . _i think that_ [it] probably _would be_ _a_ _a good_ _program ._ _i think_ probably two years _is_ _too_ _long_ . 
B|2| M: _it's_ _not_ [a] [program] _it's a_ [program .] 
A|3| B: _i think_ maybe [a] year _would be_ _the_ longest . 
B|4| M: _how_ [long] [would] [it] _take_ _to_ train _in the_ us ? 
A|5| B: yeah _and_ _there_ will _be_ _a lot_ _of_ rebellion [in] _that_ _and_ when [you] _get_ _people_ who _have no_ desire [to] _be_ _there_ [in the] first _place_ _i_ _don't_ _think that_ _they're_ going [to] _be_ serving anybody . 
B|6| M: _it's_ [the] _most_ popular [place] _to go_ _for a_ [long] _time ._ 
A|7| B: yeah . _so_ _i [think_ it _would] be_ _a good_ thing though [to] encourage other _people_ who aren't even aware _that_ _they can_ [do] such [a] thing . _to get_ out _there_ _and_ [do] _so_ . 
B|8| M: [i] . 
A|9| B: yeah . right . 
B|10| M: [i think] [you] ? 
A|11| B: right . _college credit_ _is _a_ good idea_ _because_ 
B|12| M: [i think] _it's_ [too] late . 
A|13| B: right . 
B|14| M: [college credit] . 
A|15| B: that's right yeah _they_ probably couldn't [do] anything monetary _but [i_ think] _giving_ _giving_ _some_ kind _of_ [college credit] 
B|16| M: oh [so] [they're] basically [giving] _them_ _money_ ? 
A|17| B: _no_ [i] _don't_ [think] [so] either _because_ _a lot_ _of people_ um depending _on how_ [the] public service _programs_ _are_ set up _and_ _i'm_ [not] _that_ familiar with [them] [to] _know_ 
B|18| M: _you know_ 
A|19| B: _but [you_ know] _if_ [a] _a lot_ _of people_ flat _can't_ afford [to] . 
B|20| M: [you] 
A|21| B: [you know] 
B|22| M: [because] [i think] [a lot] [people] _uh_ depends [on how] _much_ _money_ [i] [have] 
A|23| B: _and_ [most] _kids_ these days [have] gotten themselves _into_ [uh] financial situations where _they have to_ _be_ _working_ _all_ [the] [time .] 
B|24| M: [most] [people] [are] young [in] [a] _way_ . 
A|25| B: [so] [it's] [it's a] really _tough_ question . that's right . 
B|26| M: [i think] [they have] . 
A|27| B: yeah 
B|28| M: well [the] [kids] [in the] uk [are] [all] [working] . 
A|29| B: _and if_ [you] put [them] [in] public service right out _of_ high _school_ then _that_ _that_ postpones their [college] [for a] year 
B|30| M: why [do] [you] [think] [they] _are a_ problem ? 
A|31| B: _and_ _that_ [would] upset [a lot] _of people_ [too] [because] [they] _just_ _want _to_ get_ [on] 
B|32| M: [you] mean [they have _to] _go to_ school_ [to get] [the] grades [they] _want to go_ [into] . 
A|33| B: yeah . [i] [you know] [i [think] it _would] be_ _good_ [for [a] lot] _of people_ [to get] involved [in] _that_ kind _of_ [program] 
B|34| M: [so] ... [would] [that] make _it [a_ good idea] ? 
A|35| B: _but i_ [i [think] it] _can't_ _be_ something that's mandatory . 
B|36| M: [i think] [it's] fine . 
A|37| B: [it] has [to] _be_ something that's voluntary . [you know] which _is_ _pretty_ [much] [the] [way] [it] _is_ now . [they] might 
B|38| M: [but you] [can't] make _a choice_ [to] participate . 
A|39| B: yeah _and_ that's [the] other thing _is_ [that] [you know] instead _of_ making [it] mandatory [they] maybe need [to] publicize [it a] little bit better _. and_ [uh] [you know] [go to] [the] schools _and_ [do] _programs_ _and_ tell [them] [that] we need your help _and_ [you know] [uh] volunteer [for] such _and_ such [a] [time] 
B|40| M:  
A|41| B: _and_ you've [a choice] _of_ where [you] [want to go] . 
B|42| M: [i] [have] [some] ? 
A|43| B: _and_ _and_ [that] [way] handling [it] [that] [way] [they] _could_ probably [get] [some] results out _of_ _it ._ 
B|44| M: what ??!? 
A|45| B: yeah [in] their own community right . yeah that's true [most] _of_ [them] probably wouldn't [do] something _like that ._ although _there [are_ [a] lot] _of_ [kids] who [would] [do] [it] _just_ [to get] away from their parents 
B|46| M: [you] . 
A|47| B: [but] [they] [would] [have to] _be_ supported [in] [some] [way] _and_ _i'm_ _not sure_ [that] those _programs_ [are] available [to] [do] _that ._ 
B|48| M: [i think] 
A|49| B: right . 
B|50| M: [are] [you] serious ? 
A|51| B: right exactly . 
B|52| M: [i] mean [you] [could] [just] sit around _they don't_ [have to] pay [you] 
A|53| B: yeah [it] _is_ _tough_ . [it's] _and_ [i] [don't] [know] who's even proposing [it] or or [how] [they] plan [on] implementing [it] _if they_ [do] . 
B|54| M: [not sure] [if] [it's] worth mentioning [but] this [is a] [pretty] [tough] _one_ .

B|56| M: [but] ... [they can] . 
A|57| B: [you know] [it] _be_ [it] wouldn't [take] up [much] [much] [it would] [take] up more [time] than anything [but] [it] wouldn't [take] up [a lot] _of_ [money] .

B|64| M: yes . yes [. [and] [if] they] dont [know] [they] [are] [just] as bad as me . 
A|65| B: [and] _i think that_ [they] [could] [get] [some] results from [that] [because] _there [are_ [a] lot] [of people] who [are] volunteer [and] community minded 
B|66| M: [i think] [you have] [the] wrong subreddit . 
A|67| B: [but] [they don't] [know] where [to go to] [to] [to] [do] anything . 
B|68| M: [because] [they're] volunteers . 
A|69| B: yeah [it] [is] . [it] really [is] . 
B|70| M: [i think that] [is] [the] problem . 
A|71| B: right .

A|79| B: yeah [it] [is a] [tough] question . 
B|80| M: [but i] [have] heard [that] [there are] [no] [programs] [for] [it .] 
A|81| B: [sure] same here . 
B|82| M: [i] [have no] [idea] what [you] mean by [that .]
