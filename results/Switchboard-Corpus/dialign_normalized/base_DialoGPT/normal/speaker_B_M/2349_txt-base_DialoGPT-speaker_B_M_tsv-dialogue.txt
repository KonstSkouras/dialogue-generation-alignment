B|0| M: _how_ _do_ _you_ _think it would_ work ? 
A|1| B: yeah , yeah . _i think_ _that_ [it] probably _would be_ _a_ _, _a_ good_ _program ._ _i think_ probably two years _is_ _too_ _long_ . 
B|2| M: _it's_ _not_ [a] _program _,_ it's a_ [program .] 
A|3| B: _i think_ maybe [a] year _would be_ _, the_ longest . 
B|4| M: _how_ [long] [would] [it] _take_ _to_ train _in the_ us ? 
A|5| B: yeah , _and_ _there_ will _be_ _a lot_ _of_ rebellion [in] _that_ _and_ when [you] _get_ _people_ who _have no_ desire [to] _be_ _there_ [in the] first _place_ _, i_ _don't_ [think] _that_ _they're_ going [to] _be_ serving anybody . 
B|6| M: _it's_ [the] _most_ popular [place] _to go_ _for a_ [long] _time ._ 
A|7| B: yeah . _so_ _i [think_ it _would] be_ _a good_ thing though , [to] encourage other _people_ who aren't even aware _that_ _they can_ [do] such [a] thing . _to get_ out _there_ _and_ [do] _so_ . 
B|8| M: [i] . 
A|9| B: yeah . right . 
B|10| M: [i think] [you] ? 
A|11| B: right . _college credit_ _is _a_ good idea_ _because ,_ 
B|12| M: [i think] _it's_ [too] late . 
A|13| B: right . 
B|14| M: [college credit] . 
A|15| B: that's right yeah _, they_ probably couldn't [do] anything monetary _, _but_ _i_ think ,_ _giving_ , _giving_ _some_ kind _of_ [college credit] , 
B|16| M: oh , [so] [they're] basically [giving] _them_ _money_ ? 
A|17| B: _no_ _, i_ _don't_ [think] [so] either _because_ _a lot_ _of _people_ ,_ um , depending _on how_ [the] public service _programs_ _are_ set up _and_ _i'm_ [not] _that_ familiar with [them] [to] _know ,_ 
B|18| M: _you know_ 
A|19| B: _but_ _, [you_ _know] ,_ _if_ _, a_ _, a lot_ _of people_ flat _can't_ afford [to] . 
B|20| M: _you ,_ 
A|21| B: [you _know] ,_ 
B|22| M: [because _,] i think [,_ a lot] [people _,] uh ,_ depends [on how] _much_ _money_ [i] [have] 
A|23| B: _and_ [most] _kids_ these days [have] gotten themselves _into_ [, uh ,] financial situations , where _they have to_ _be_ _working_ _all_ [the] [time .] 
B|24| M: [most] [people] [are] young _, in_ [a] _way_ . 
A|25| B: [so] [, it's] [, it's a] really _tough_ question . that's right . 
B|26| M: [i think] [they have] . 
A|27| B: yeah , 
B|28| M: well [, the] [kids] [in the] uk [are] [all] [working] . 
A|29| B: _and_ , _if_ [you] put [them] [in] public service right out _of_ high _school_ , then _that_ _, that_ postpones their [college] , [for a] year 
B|30| M: why [do] [you] [think] [they] _are a_ problem ? 
A|31| B: _and_ _that_ [would] upset [a lot] _of people_ [too] , [because] [they] _just_ _want _to_ get_ [on] , 
B|32| M: [you] mean [they have _to] _go to_ school_ [to get] [the] grades [they] _want to go_ [into] . 
A|33| B: yeah . [i] _, [you_ _know] [,_ i [think] it _would] be_ _good_ [for [a] lot] _of people_ [to get] involved [in] _that_ kind _of_ [program ,] 
B|34| M: [so] ... [would] [that] make _it [a_ good idea] ? 
A|35| B: _but i_ [, i [think] it] _can't_ _be_ something that's mandatory . 
B|36| M: [i think] [it's] fine . 
A|37| B: [it] has [to] _be_ something that's voluntary . [you _know] ,_ which _is_ _pretty_ [much] [the] [way] [it] _is_ now . [they] might , 
B|38| M: [but] [you] [can't] make _a choice_ [to] participate . 
A|39| B: yeah , _and_ that's [the] other thing _is_ [that] _, [you_ _know] ,_ instead _of_ making [it] mandatory _, they_ maybe need [to] publicize [it a] little bit better _. and_ [, uh _,] [you_ _know] ,_ [go to] [the] schools _and_ [do] _programs_ , _and_ tell [them] [that] we need your help , _and_ _, [you_ _know] [,_ uh ,] volunteer [for] such _and_ such [a] [time] , 
B|40| M:  
A|41| B: _and_ you've [a choice] _of_ where [you] [want to go] . 
B|42| M: [i] [have] [some] ? 
A|43| B: _and_ , _and_ [that] [way] , handling [it] [that] [way] [they] _could_ probably [get] [some] results out _of_ _it ._ 
B|44| M: what ??!? 
A|45| B: yeah [, in] their own community , right . yeah , that's true [most] _of_ [them] probably wouldn't [do] something _like that ._ although _there [are_ [a] lot] _of_ [kids] who [would] [do] [it] _just_ [to get] away from their parents 
B|46| M: [you] . 
A|47| B: [but] _, they_ [would] [have to] _be_ supported [in] [some] [way] , _and_ _i'm_ _not sure_ [that] those _programs_ [are] available [to] [do] _that ._ 
B|48| M: [i think] 
A|49| B: right . 
B|50| M: [are] [you] serious ? 
A|51| B: right , exactly . 
B|52| M: [i] mean [, you] [could] [just] sit around [, _they] don't_ [have to] pay [you] 
A|53| B: yeah , [it] _is_ _tough_ . [it's] , _and_ [i] [don't] [know] who's even proposing [it] , or , or [how] [they] plan [on] implementing [it] , _if they_ [do] . 
B|54| M: [not sure] [if] [it's] worth mentioning [, but] this [is a] [pretty] [tough] _one_ .

B|56| M: [but] ... [they can] . 
A|57| B: [you _know] ,_ [it] _be_ , [it] wouldn't [take] up [much] , [much] , [it would] [take] up more [time] than anything [but] [it] wouldn't [take] up [a lot] _of_ [money] .

A|61| B: [you] [go to school] _and_ _you _have_ a_ kind _of a_ captive audience , [get] [them] [all] [in the] auditorium ,

B|64| M: yes . yes [. and] [if they] dont [know [,] they] [are] [just] as bad as me . 
A|65| B: [and] [, _i think ,] that_ [they] [could] [get] [some] results from [that] , [because] _there [are_ [a] lot] [of people] who [are] volunteer [and] community minded , 
B|66| M: [i think] [you have] [the] wrong subreddit . 
A|67| B: [but] [they don't] [know] where [to go to] , [to] , [to] [do] anything . 
B|68| M: [because] [they're] volunteers . 
A|69| B: yeah , [it] [is] . [it] really [is] . 
B|70| M: [i think , that] [is] [the] problem . 
A|71| B: right . 
B|72| M: [it's] [the] carter administration 
A|73| B: yeah , yeah . 
B|74| M: [but] ... [you know] ... [things like that .] 
A|75| B: uh-huh . 
B|76| M: [i think] [i] [know] [you] . 
A|77| B: [i] [don't] either that's _one ,_ 
B|78| M: [i] never thought i'd [be] [in the] minority [on] this [one [,] but] [i'm] still [a] big fan [of] [the] [program .] 
A|79| B: yeah , [it] [is a] [tough] question . 
B|80| M: [but i] [have] heard [that] [there are] [no] [programs] [for] [it .] 
A|81| B: [sure] , same here . 
B|82| M: [i] [have no] [idea] what [you] mean by [that .]
