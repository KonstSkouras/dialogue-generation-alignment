B|75| M: [i] 
A|76| B: [yeah] [i mean [,] [i] know] _that's_ [what] [my] father-in-law [was] talking [about] [, [you] [know] ,] [when] [you] give these [people] _money_ or , [what] [was] [it] [they were] bringing up points asking as far as whether [they] need [to] give , um , more _money_ [to] these [people] [, [i] mean _,] and_ _that's_ [not really] [the] answer [, [i] mean ,] because _if they're_ alcoholics they'll [just] [go] [out] [and] spend , [it] on [, [you] [know] ,] booze or something [like] _that ,_ 
B|77| M:  ...

B|83| M: [i know] [what you] [mean] . [but] [if they're] [going to] try [to [do] [that] ,] [they] should [do [it] .] 
A|84| B: [i mean [,] i] guess [we're] getting kind [of] off [the] subject , here [, but] . 
B|85| M: you're [right .] 
A|86| B: [yeah [,] [i] mean] [it's ,] _true ._ [yeah] .

A|88| B: [yeah] . 
B|89| M: [that's true .]
