B|1| M: _i know_ . 
A|2| B: _yeah_ 
B|3| M: _i mean_ i've seen _people_ say _that ._ 
A|4| B: _that's true ._ 
B|5| M: _they_ _are the_ best . 
A|6| B: um me either _. i_ [i] went _to_ college _and_ then started working _and_ then got married _and_ 
B|7| M: _what_ _about you_ ? 
A|8| B: _no_ [i] haven't [i know] [that] _uh_ _my_ sister [i] _have a_ twin sister _and_ _when they_ graduated _she_ went _to_ _uh_ teach _in_ _a_ small town down _in_ south texas _and_ [i know] [that] _like_ _if_ [you] _have_ college notes _if_ [you] teach _in_ _a_ lower income bracket _where_ [they] _don't_ pay as much _and_ [they] cancel part _of_ your _you know_ your college note or whatever . 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: uh-huh . _if_ _it's_ _like_ _you know_ _really a_ _you know_ _a_ lower paying job _you know_ _where_ _in_ _a_ small town [you] _don't_ obviously [you] _don't_ need as much as far as _to_ _you know_ _to_ live . 
B|11| M:  
A|12| B: _yeah_ _she_ _only_ taught there _one_ year _but_ [i] 
B|13| M: _how_ _i'm_ 
A|14| B: uh-huh . 
B|15| M: [yeah] [but] [she] _didn't_ _get the_ credit 
A|16| B: _and_ um _i think_ _it_ _would_ be [i know] [that] also _one_ _of_ _my_ cousins _who_ _uh_ he _is in_ _like_ [the] therapy type thing _and_ he _was_ um _some_ group paid part _of_ his college income [but] then he _was_ required _to go_ back _and_ work for _a_ certain number _of_ years _in_ this town at _uh_ _uh [i_ mean] _it's a_ nursing home or something _like_ [that .] 
B|17| M: [i think] [it's] [the] [one] [where] [she] teaches 
A|18| B: _so_ _you know_ _if_ [i think] _that's_ _a good_ _way_ for [people] _to_ _you know_ _maybe_ [get] [people] _to_ come back _to_ these small towns _to_ work by helping [people] [that] normally might _not_ be able _to go to_ college _and_ [get the] type _of_ degree [they] want . 
B|19| M: [you know] 
A|20| B: [yeah] . as far as [yeah] getting doctors _and_ _all_ [that] stuff [yeah] . 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: [yeah] . 
B|23| M: oh 
A|24| B: uh-huh .

A|28| B: [i] _really_ _don't_ [know] [that] much [about] _it_ [you know] [i] [i] [i think] [of _the] peace corps_ [you know] more [like] [the] sixties [and] [that] kind [of] stuff _when_ 
B|29| M: [i] [uh _i] don't_ . 
A|30| B: [yeah] [. and] [don't] [they] [go] into other countries [and] stuff ? 
B|31| M: [yeah] _they're_ called [the peace corps] . 
A|32| B: uh-huh . _things that_ _make_ [the] [yeah] . _make_ them more self-supporting ? 
B|33| M: _how_ _do_ [they] _do that_ ? 
A|34| B: [yeah] . 
B|35| M: [yeah] [you] ? 
A|36| B: _right ._ [yeah] . 
B|37| M: [but] we _do_ [have a] program [that] does [that .] 
A|38| B: [but] _it_ definitely _would_ give _a lot [of_ the] _kids_ now _that have_ everything given [to] them _that they_ want [to] [see] [what] [it's] [like] _if_ [you] [don't] [have] _all the_ _money_ [and] can't [have] _what you_ want _when_ [you] want _it ._ 
B|39| M: _i don't_ [think] [so] 
A|40| B: uh-huh . 
B|41| M: you're [kids] . 
A|42| B: [yeah] . 
B|43| M: [would] [it] 
A|44| B: [i don't] [i don't] [know] [that] [you] could require everyone _to do that_ for [yeah] _to _do_ it_ for [a] whole year or two years or something [like] [that] 
B|45| M: [maybe] [you] _can_ [make] [a] list [of] [all the] [things [that] have] been done _in the_ past ? 
A|46| B: [i don't] [know] [that] [that] [would] work _if_ somebody's _was_ [didn't] _really_ want [to] be there [and] [didn't] [have] 
B|47| M: _can_ we _just_ [have a] mandatory season ? 
A|48| B: [yeah] [i mean] there [would] be loopholes [just] [like] there [is in] anything else

A|56| B: uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [people] _are_ still extinct point [and] figure 
A|58| B: _right_ [yeah] . 
B|59| M: you're [right .] 
A|60| B: [yeah] uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [it's a] question [but] [it's] _not [really_ a] question . 
A|62| B: [yeah] . 
B|63| M: [i think] [the] fact [that _they] were_ [so] sad [when _they] were_ kicked _out_ [of the] _country_ [was] [a good] example . 
A|64| B: [yeah] . 
B|65| M: [they] _are_ [all] [like] friends . 
A|66| B: [yeah] . 
B|67| M: [i mean] ... [you] [do] [have] [the peace corps] though . 
A|68| B: well down here [with] [the peace corps] [we're] talking [about] [all] these [people] [that] aren't even [in] our own [country] [when] [there's] enough [people] here [that] [i think] probably need help [and] could be helped .

A|70| B: [yeah] . 
B|71| M: [no] . [it's] _not [really_ a] problem . 
A|72| B: [and] [maybe] [rather] than [just] require somebody [to] join [like] [the peace corps] for [a] year [maybe] [like] um during college [you know] [maybe] [have] [some] kind [of] course [where] they'd be required _to do_ [some] kind [of] community service type work [and] help [people] [in] [that] area or [people] [in the] united states . 
B|73| M: north america 
A|74| B: there probably [are] [you know] for [but] [i'm] sure _that's_ probably [like] [people] [that] [do that] [are] [are the] [people] [that] [are going [to] go] into social work [and] stuff [but] [i think] [that] [it] wouldn't [really] be half bad for everybody [not] _to do_ something [you know] [and] realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to] um help these [people] [you know] [and] _i'm not saying_ [just] give them _money_ [but] [i mean] because [they] [have to] be taught [to] be 
B|75| M: [i] 
A|76| B: [yeah] [i mean] [i know] _that's_ [what] [my] father-in-law [was] talking [about [you] know] [when] [you] give these [people] _money_ or [what] [was] [it] [they were] bringing up points asking as far as whether [they] need [to] give um more _money_ [to] these [people] [i mean] [and] _that's_ [not really] [the] answer [i mean] because _if they're_ alcoholics they'll [just] [go] [out] [and] spend [it] on [you know] booze or something [like] [that] 
B|77| M:  ... 
A|78| B: [but] . 
B|79| M: [money] 
A|80| B: [yeah] . 
B|81| M: [i'm] [it's] [and] 
A|82| B: or [you know] [to] find [a] job [where] [they] [can] learn [how] [to] support themselves 
B|83| M: [i know] [what you] [mean] . [but] [if they're] [going to] try [to do [that] they] should [do [it] .] 
A|84| B: [i mean] [i] guess [we're] getting kind [of] off [the] subject here [but] . 
B|85| M: you're [right .] 
A|86| B: [yeah] [i mean] [it's] _true ._ [yeah] . 
B|87| M: [true .] [i'm not saying] [that] [the] military [is] [the] [only] branch [of the] us government . 
A|88| B: [yeah] . 
B|89| M: [that's true .] 
A|90| B: flower mound [yeah] . [so] [we're] [a] little [you know] farther removed from [like] dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas [where] [they] probably [have] more [of the] homeless [and] [that] type [of] thing .
