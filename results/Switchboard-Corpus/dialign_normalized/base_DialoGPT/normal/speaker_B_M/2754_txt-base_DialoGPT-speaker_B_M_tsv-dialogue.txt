B|25| M: [florida] ? _what_ ? 
A|26| B: [course] _they_ [have] such _a crime_ problem [because] _they_ [have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] uhh . you're [right .] 
A|28| B: _get_ [that] unemployment _way_ _up_ [so] then people [, you know] tend towards _crime_ [, and] then _they_ _they_ start stiffening [the] penalties . 
B|29| M: [i don't _know] ._ 
A|30| B: [well ,] [in] [florida] seems _like_ [, uh ,] two _or_ three times [a] year . [it's] constantly on [the ,] 
B|31| M: [it .] 
A|32| B: [yeah .] _no _,_ that's_ true . [course] _they_ [have] [a] requirement [that] [, uh ,] [that] every single _appeal_ must be permitted . 
B|33| M: i' , 
A|34| B: [so] , [of course] _, [the_ _,] the_ attorneys ,

A|36| B: _they_ [go] all _the way_ _up_ [to] _the supreme court_ [, _you know] ._

A|44| B: everyone knows _they're going_ [get] , [not] _going to get_ _out ._ 
B|45| M: [and] [they] [get] [them] [out .] 
A|46| B: [yeah .]

A|48| B: uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [you] [don't _know] that ._ 
A|50| B: uh-huh . 
B|51| M: [you know .] 
A|52| B: [i think so .] 
B|53| M: [no [,] i think] you're [the] _only_ one . 
A|54| B: [uh ,] [a] lot [of] [the [,] [the] [,] the] other violent crimes [i don't] really feel [that] strongly [about] . although [, you know ,] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole , 
B|55| M: _what_ [do you] [mean] ? 
A|56| B: [i] [mean] , these guys are certainly [not] _going to_ [, uh ,] be _, they_ can't [, i] [mean] _they're_ getting into drugs [and] fights [and] all [that] stuff [in] prison . _i don't think_ [the] parole system _is_ really helping [that] much 
B|57| M: [the way] [i] understand [it] _is that_ _they're going to get_ [the] same treatment _as_ [the] inmates . 
A|58| B: reduce [the] violence [in the] prisons . [i think] _that's_ its [only] purpose [is] , [is] [, you know ,] [to] reduce [, uh [,] the] violence [in the] prisons [so] people behave themselves [a] little bit better if [they] [think] [they're going to get] off early . off earlier . 
B|59| M:  ... 
A|60| B: [but] some [of] these guys _just_ [don't] care [, [you know] .] [and] [so] [, uh ,] 
B|61| M: [so _.] uh_ 
A|62| B: _yeah ,_ [right] , uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [i don't think] [you know] _what_ [that] word means . 
A|64| B: um _, that's_ _possible_ [i] guess . 
B|65| M: _maybe_ he's [a] murderer . 
A|66| B: um , [so] where [do you] live [in pennsylvania] ? 
B|67| M: _i was just saying_ _what_ [it] [is] _. uh_ 
A|68| B: _oh _,_ okay ._ [i don't think] [i] really [know that .] 
B|69| M: [in pennsylvania] . 
A|70| B: [because [, uh] [,] you know ,] [that] all depends , too , on where [you] are at . _that's_ [, uh ,] sort [of] interesting [to get] opinions [as] [to] where different parts [of] [the] country are . [because] [the] more grass root country [, uh ,] parts [of] [the] country tend [to] , [to] support capital punishment , where [the] places [that] are [, you know ,] less [in] contact [with] [crime] [you know [,] [the] [,] the] more , more urban [, i] [mean] less , 
B|71| M:

B|79| M: _what_ _is that_ ? 
A|80| B: very old [, uh ,] historical _place_ there . 
B|81| M: [oh ,] i've heard [of] [it .] 
A|82| B: sharon , pennsylvania's [up] there . 
B|83| M: [well [,] that's] [not] [a place] . 
A|84| B: [yeah .] 
B|85| M: [oh] _. well [,_ okay .] 
A|86| B: [oh [,] okay .] 
B|87| M: _i'm_ [in] california . 
A|88| B: [in] [that] case , [maybe] [, [you know] .] 
B|89| M: [i don't [know] .] 
A|90| B: [right .] [that's] true . _yeah [,_ well ,] [it] , [it] [, you know [,] you] [get] certain circumstances where [you] hear [about] these people [that] [have] [, you know ,] stolen kids [and] [, you know ,] done terrible things [to] [them] [and] killed [them] [and] [, you know ,] [that] sort [of] thing , 
B|91| M:  
A|92| B: [you] [just] [like] [, i don't] want [that] person sharing [the] earth [with] me [, you know [,] i] [mean] , [that] [is] [just] terrible . 
B|93| M: [you] . 
A|94| B: [and] [, uh [,] you know ,] [we] had [a] case [like that] here [and] , on [the] other hand [, you know ,] people are [saying] [that] [because] [the ,] he knows [, because] [the] criminals [know that] [the [,] uh ,] penalties can be very severe _, they_ [, uh ,] there's less criminals [that] are [, you know ,] turning themselves [in] , [or] [, you know ,] pleading [or] whatever [, because] [they] [know that] [the] [judge] [, you know ,] if [they] find [them] [guilty] [is] [, you know ,] [has] [the [,] the] opportunity [to] sentence [them] [, you know ,] for , for [the] death sentence . 
B|95| M:  
A|96| B: [yeah [.] well ,] [i'm] [just saying] [that] , [that] [, _that's] what_ [, [the] [,] the] client , lawyers are _saying ._ [they're] [saying] [that] [, you know [,] you know ,] more [of] my clients [would] [have] pleaded [guilty] if [they] [would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly having [to] , [to] , [to get] [a] death sentence [because] [you] can't plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] [going to] be . 
B|97| M: [no] . 
A|98| B: [right] , uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [they] ,. 
A|100| B: _yeah ,_ [right .] 
B|101| M: [yeah [,] they] deserve nothing . [they] deserve . 
A|102| B: uh-huh . [i was just saying] [that] [way] , [what] [they're] [saying] [is that] [they] can't [get] people [to] turn themselves [in] then . [and] [so] , [we [have] to go] through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's [guilty] . 
B|103| M: [that's what] [i was] [saying .] 
A|104| B: [and] perhaps [we] can [and] perhaps [we] can't [and] [so] [the] guy might [get] off . 
B|105| M: [because] [it] [is] [possible] 
A|106| B: [and] [, uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] are turning themselves [in] are , are guys [that] are [, you know] [going to get] caught anyways [but] , there's always [a] few [of] those people [that] are [, you know ,] lost their head [or] whatever . 
B|107| M: [i] 
A|108| B: anyways [, but] [, uh] . [yeah ,] [we] [just] had [a] terrible case [in] virginia where some girl disappeared [and] [, and] [the] guy , [like] [i] said , he [just] [, uh ,] said [that] he took her [, but] he won't admit [that] she died [or] whatever [, and] he won't say where [the] body [is] [because] he knows [the] penalty's very [you know ,] mandatory life sentences for murder .
