A|12| B: uh-huh . 
B|13| M: _i_ dunno . 
A|14| B: _well_ [i think] [that] should be likewise decided by [the] _jury you know because_ _i don't know_ [i think] _a jury_ [would] be less likely [to] _just_ send _a_ man [to] death _just_ for any reason 
B|15| M: _i think so ._ 
A|16| B: _i don't know _a_ judge_ might be _a_ little more cold-blooded _about_ [it .]

A|24| B: uh-huh . _oh_ _yeah_ _they're_ always [in] _florida_ . _florida_ [and] louisiana [i think] [and] [uh] some [of] [the] other southern states . 
B|25| M: [florida] ? _what_ ? 
A|26| B: [course] _they_ [have] such _a crime_ problem [because] _they_ [have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
B|27| M: [yeah .] uhh . you're [right .] 
A|28| B: _get_ [that] unemployment _way_ _up_ [so] then people [you know] tend towards _crime_ [and] then _they_ _they_ start stiffening [the] penalties . 
B|29| M: [i don't _know] ._ 
A|30| B: [well] [in] [florida] seems _like_ [uh] two _or_ three times [a] year . [it's] constantly on [the] 
B|31| M: [it .] 
A|32| B: [yeah .] [no] _that's_ true . [course] _they_ [have] [a] requirement [that] [uh] [that] every single _appeal_ must be permitted . 
B|33| M: i' 
A|34| B: [so] [of course] [the] [the] attorneys 
B|35| M: [no] [it's] _not_ . 
A|36| B: _they_ [go] all _the way_ _up_ [to] _the supreme court_ _you know ._ 
B|37| M: [well] [the supreme court] _has_ [no] power [to] [appeal] . 
A|38| B: _they_ almost always _get_ thrown [right] back _out_ again _but_ _they_ [have to] [have] every single [appeal] made open [to] _them_ . 
B|39| M: [i don't know] [about] [you] [but] i've never seen [a judge] [or] [jury] [that] [wasn't] _guilty_ [of] [a crime] . 
A|40| B: some [of] these guys are really [uh] [you know] violent son [of] sam killers [and] stuff _like that_ _you know ._ 
B|41| M: i've never seen anyone [get] beaten [up] [like _that] ._ 
A|42| B: [i] [mean] _they_ 
B|43| M: _i'm_ sorry [but] [how do you] [think] [they] [do] [that] ? 
A|44| B: everyone knows _they're going_ [get] [not] _going to get_ _out ._ 
B|45| M: [and] [they] [get] [them] [out .] 
A|46| B: [yeah .] 
B|47| M: [so] [they] [get] [the] same treatment _as_ [the] rest [of] us ? 
A|48| B: uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [you] [don't _know] that ._ 
A|50| B: uh-huh . 
B|51| M: [you know .] 
A|52| B: [i think so .] 
B|53| M: [no] [i think] you're [the] _only_ one . 
A|54| B: [uh] [a] lot [of] [the] [the] [the] other violent crimes [i don't] really feel [that] strongly [about] . although [you know] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole 
B|55| M: _what_ [do you] [mean] ? 
A|56| B: [i] [mean] these guys are certainly [not] _going to_ [uh] be [they] can't [i] [mean] _they're_ getting into drugs [and] fights [and] all [that] stuff [in] prison . _i don't think_ [the] parole system _is_ really helping [that] much 
B|57| M: [the way] [i] understand [it] _is that_ _they're going to get_ [the] same treatment _as_ [the] inmates . 
A|58| B: reduce [the] violence [in the] prisons . [i think] _that's_ its [only] purpose [is] [is] [you know] [to] reduce [uh] [the] violence [in the] prisons [so] people behave themselves [a] little bit better if [they] [think] [they're going to get] off early . off earlier . 
B|59| M:  ... 
A|60| B: [but] some [of] these guys _just_ [don't] care [you know .] [and] [so] [uh] 
B|61| M: [so _.] uh_ 
A|62| B: [yeah] [right] uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [i don't think] [you know] _what_ [that] word means . 
A|64| B: um _that's_ _possible_ [i] guess . 
B|65| M: _maybe_ he's [a] murderer . 
A|66| B: um [so] where [do you] live [in pennsylvania] ? 
B|67| M: _i was just saying_ _what_ [it] [is] _. uh_ 
A|68| B: _oh_ _okay ._ [i don't think] [i] really [know that .] 
B|69| M: [in pennsylvania] . 
A|70| B: [because uh] [you [know] that] all depends too on where [you] are at . _that's_ [uh] sort [of] interesting [to get] opinions [as] [to] where different parts [of] [the] country are . [because] [the] more grass root country [uh] parts [of] [the] country tend [to] [to] support capital punishment where [the] places [that] are [you know] less [in] contact [with] [crime] [you know] [the] [the] more more urban [i] [mean] less 
B|71| M:  
A|72| B: uh-huh . 
B|73| M: _i'm_ . 
A|74| B: two hours where ? 
B|75| M:  ... 
A|76| B: _oh_ _okay ._ _near_ polk ? 
B|77| M: [near] pittsburg . 
A|78| B: polk institute . [it's] [uh] an old [uh] university [that] turned into _a place_ for [the] mentally retarded [. uh] 
B|79| M: _what_ _is that_ ? 
A|80| B: very old [uh] historical _place_ there . 
B|81| M: [oh] i've heard [of] [it .] 
A|82| B: sharon pennsylvania's [up] there . 
B|83| M: [well] [that's] [not] [a place] . 
A|84| B: [yeah .] 
B|85| M: [oh] _. well_ [okay .] 
A|86| B: [oh] [okay .] 
B|87| M: _i'm_ [in] california . 
A|88| B: [in] [that] case [maybe] [you know .] 
B|89| M: [i don't [know] .] 
A|90| B: [right .] [that's] true . [yeah] [well] [it] [it] [you know] [you] [get] certain circumstances where [you] hear [about] these people [that] [have] [you know] stolen kids [and] [you know] done terrible things [to] [them] [and] killed [them] [and] [you [know] that] sort [of] thing 
B|91| M:  
A|92| B: [you] [just] [like] [i don't] want [that] person sharing [the] earth [with] me [you know] [i] [mean that] [is] [just] terrible . 
B|93| M: [you] . 
A|94| B: [and] [uh] [you know] [we] had [a] case [like that] here [and] on [the] other hand [you know] people are [saying] [that] [because] [the] he knows [because] [the] criminals [know that] [the] [uh] penalties can be very severe [they] [uh] there's less criminals [that] are [you know] turning themselves [in] [or] [you know] pleading [or] whatever [because] [they] [know that] [the] [judge] [you know] if [they] find [them] [guilty] [is] [you know] [has] [the] [the] opportunity [to] sentence [them] [you know] for for [the] death sentence . 
B|95| M:  
A|96| B: [yeah [.] well] [i'm] [just saying] [that] [that] _that's what_ [the] [the] client lawyers are _saying ._ [they're] [saying] [that] [you know] [you know] more [of] my clients [would] [have] pleaded [guilty] if [they] [would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly having [to] [to] [to get] [a] death sentence [because] [you] can't plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] [going to] be . 
B|97| M: [no] . 
A|98| B: [right] uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [they] . 
A|100| B: [yeah] [right .] 
B|101| M: [yeah] [they] deserve nothing . [they] deserve . 
A|102| B: uh-huh . [i was just saying] [that] [way] [what] [they're] [saying] [is that] [they] can't [get] people [to] turn themselves [in] then . [and] [so] [we [have] to go] through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's [guilty] . 
B|103| M: [that's what] [i was] [saying .] 
A|104| B: [and] perhaps [we] can [and] perhaps [we] can't [and] [so] [the] guy might [get] off . 
B|105| M: [because] [it] [is] [possible] 
A|106| B: [and] [uh] although usually [the] guys [that] are turning themselves [in] are are guys [that] are [you know] [going to get] caught anyways [but] there's always [a] few [of] those people [that] are [you know] lost their head [or] whatever . 
B|107| M: [i] 
A|108| B: anyways [but] [uh] . [yeah] [we] [just] had [a] terrible case [in] virginia where some girl disappeared [and] [and] [the] guy [like] [i] said he [just] [uh] said [that] he took her [but] he won't admit [that] she died [or] whatever [and] he won't say where [the] body [is] [because] he knows [the] penalty's very [you know] mandatory life sentences for murder .
