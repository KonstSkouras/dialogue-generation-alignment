B|43| M: _well_ _i don't think_ [they [do] .] 
A|44| B: _right_ [the] first _appeal is_ automatic [so] [that] delays [it] for [a] few years just _right_ off [the] bat . 
B|45| M: [the] [appeal is] [that it] takes [a] year [or] [so] [to] [get] [to] [the] next [appeal] .

B|47| M: i'm sorry [. i don't] [get] [it .] 
A|48| B: _yes_ uh-huh . [that's] [that's] fairly recent [i [don't] know how] recent [but] fairly recent [in the] state [of] _texas_ . before [that it] was _uh_ [death] by electrocution . 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: _yes_ [it] certainly _does_ . 
B|51| M: [it's] 
A|52| B: _yes_ [it] _would_ almost [have to] _be_ [i] suppose . [if you] [if you] had [to] chose [i] guess _i would_ [i am] [sure] _i would_ take [the] lethal injection .

B|55| M: [is] [this] [one of the] better ones ? 
A|56| B: _it's a_ _it's a_ tough _question_ . [it] really [is] [. i] guess [if] [i] had _to say_ _yes_ [or] [no] _i would_ _say_ [you know] _yes_ [. i] _i would_ [have to] lean toward [capital] punishment [you know] for certain crimes . 
B|57| M: [is] [it] ? 
A|58| B: [no] [i don't _think] _it's_ a_ monetary [thing .] 
B|59| M: [do] [you] _think we_ should [have] [a] prison [system] ? 
A|60| B: [i [think] we] [hope] [that it] will _be_ [you know] some sort [of] deterrent [or] [you know] an eye for an eye type [thing] [or] something like [that .] 
B|61| M: [how] [do] [you know] ? 
A|62| B: some [of the] crimes [are] just [so] brutal _and_ [so [you] know] useless . [this] may seem [to] _be the_ best way out [. i [don't] know] . 
B|63| M: [yeah [.] it's a] [crime] [but] [it's not] [a] [crime] [in the] sense [that it's] illegal . 
A|64| B: easiest way out _maybe ._ [no] [i don't _think] [it's_ a] monetary [thing .] 
B|65| M: [the] worst [thing] [is] [that [it's] not] [a] legal [thing .] 
A|66| B: _yes_ especially [the] murder rate its just gone crazy . _yes_ . 
B|67| M: [so] what's [the] deal [with] dallas ? 
A|68| B: absolutely . _yes_ [i] wish [i] had [the] answer for [that] everybody [does] . 
B|69| M: [do] [you [know] what] [the] [number of] murders per capita [in] [texas] [is] ? 
A|70| B: _yes_ [it's] nothing [to] _be_ proud [of] certainly [not .] 
B|71| M: [yes] [you] [are] . 
A|72| B: [yes] . [yes] _so have we_ been _very_ _very_ fortunate .

B|85| M: [if you] [were] [in the] jury i'm [sure] [you] [would be] able [to] tell [the] judge [what] [the] judge said . 
A|86| B: uh-huh .

A|94| B: [sure] [it's] [it's a] big responsibility [it] really [is] . 
B|95| M: [i] mean [you] can't [be the] judge [of the] jury .

A|98| B: [yes] . absolutely .
