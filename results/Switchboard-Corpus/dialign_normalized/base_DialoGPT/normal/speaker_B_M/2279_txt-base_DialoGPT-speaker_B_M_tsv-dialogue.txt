B|50| M:  ... 
A|51| B: _that_ _was_ _uh_ _that_ _was_ _a lot_ [of] fun . 
B|52| M: [i'm] sure [it's] [been] [a] [long] [time] . 
A|53| B: [but] [what] happens [is] _we_ used [to] fight _a lot_ [so] there's _never_ _much_ [of] _a family_ _family_ thing . _you know_ _one_ [of] those hell _family_ vacations . 
B|54| M: _i think_ [you] [mean] [family] .

B|58| M: _because_ [uh we] _try_ [my] mom [is] dead _you know _my_ dad_ [was] dead [and my] mom's dead [i'm] [a] _dad_ [you] [mean] . 
A|59| B: [well] [my dad] all _he_ all _he_ wanted _to do_ [was] _get_ _money_ [for] [us] [so] _he_ _could_ buy [us] material things . 
B|60| M: [so] why [did _you] have kids_ ? 
A|61| B: [and] [and] [to] me [you know] [it's] [like] [now] [i'm] twenty-two _but i_ still feel [you know] [it's] [like] [yeah] _we never_ threw _a football_ [or] something 
B|62| M: [yeah and] [we never] throw [a football] [but] [we] throw . 
A|63| B: [and] [the] way _i was_ brought up [and] _he_ wants me [now] _he_ [like] _he_ [you know] [like] _he_ wants _to be_ _best_ friends [now] 
B|64| M: [i was] raised by [a] woman _and _i_ know_ [how] 
A|65| B: [and] [it's] very hard [for] me [because] [you know] [it's] [like] [you] grow up _to be_ twenty years [old] [and] [it's] always [the same] man 
B|66| M: [i] [uh] [don't _know] [i_ don't] _think_ 
A|67| B: [and] then suddenly _he_ sees _that_ [he's] getting [old] [and] _he_ wants _to be_ _best_ friends 
B|68| M: [he] has [a] friend who [is like] 25 [and] [he's] [the] [best] friend [he's] _ever_ _had_ . 
A|69| B: [but] [uh] [you know] [it's] [like i] [can] _only_ express myself [so] _much_ [because] [you know] um everything _that_ [he] taught me [you know] _that_ [my] [family] taught me which [is] very hard [to] change _that_ all [of] [a] sudden [from] _one_ year [to the] next [and] [say] [i'm] sorry [you know] . [it's] [like] [you [know] i] love [you] [and] let's [go] out [and] [do] things together when [i don't] feel [like] [it] [you know] 
B|70| M: [i] 
A|71| B: [and] [so] _that's_ _that_ whole thing _that_ he'll [say] when [like] [like] [i've] seen [my] uncle [and] his [family] [you know] _does_ everything together [and] [you know] his [kids] _are [you_ know] when his [little] [girl] [was] five years [old] [and] everything [they] [uh] [they] would [go to the beach] [and] she _could_ [go to] sleep at two [in the] morning [you know] 
B|72| M: [you] . 
A|73| B: [and] [uh] [i was] brought up [the same] way [it] doesn't matter [what] age [you have] [just] [so] [long] as [you can] _get_ up _to go to_ class [the] next morning [you can] _stay_ up [you know] 
B|74| M: [it] 
A|75| B: [but] his [what] _he does_ [is] when [he] gets _home_ [he] separates his work [from] his house . 
B|76| M: [but] [he does] [he's] [he] stays [stay] [he] he' [he] stay' [stay] [stay] 
A|77| B: [yeah] . 
B|78| M: [you _have] [to_ be] [in] [school] [to do] [that] . 
A|79| B: [yeah] . 
B|80| M: [you [have] [a] family] ? 
A|81| B: [yeah] [yeah] [but] [uh] [it's] [just] [it's] [just] something [that] [you know my] theory [is] [you know] when when [you have kids] [and] all [you] [you] _want [to_ do] [well] [what] [i'll] [do] [is] [you know] [like i] [mean] [you] might [have] problems [but] [it's] [not] [your] kids' problems [you know] 
B|82| M:  
A|83| B: [and] [you] got [to] [try [to] be] with them as _much_ as [you can] [and] [to] [you know] [like] thing [is] [is] [that] [you know] [like] _if_ _if_ [they] would [ever] happen [to] [have a] drug problem suppose [that] [they] _could_ feel comfortable coming [to] me [and] saying [i] got [a] problem [you know] 
B|84| M:  
A|85| B: [and] [uh] [and] [that] would [make] _any_ parent feel _good_ [and] bad at [the same] [time] [you know] 
B|86| M: [you] 
A|87| B: first [of] all _you're_ coming [to] me [and] let's see [how] [we] [can] _get_ rid [of the] problem [you know] [and] _that's_ [uh] _that's_ very _that's_ very hard [to do] [because] once _you're_ [best] friends with [your] parents then [i think] everything [go] _a lot_ better . 
B|88| M:  
A|89| B: [yeah] . 
B|90| M: yes [i'm] [it's] . 
A|91| B: [yeah] [my] [my] father [was] raising four [oh] [well] three [kids] before [he] [had] me [so] [it] [was] [uh] [you know] _you're_ _trying to_ support [uh] four [kids] [and] [it's] _pretty_ hard [you know] 
B|92| M: [i] [you] 
A|93| B: [and i] [i] _told_ him listen [you] _could have_ [had] _a lot_ [of] _money_ _if_ [you] would [have] _only_ [had] two [kids] . 
B|94| M: [i _don't] have any money_ . 
A|95| B: [he] says [yeah] [but] then [i] wouldn't [have] [you] [i go] [yeah] [but] then [you] would [have _a] lot_ [of] [money] 
B|96| M: [i'm] [not] sure [if] [i] should [say] yes [but] [yeah] 
A|97| B: [yeah] . 
B|98| M: [but [i] was] [told] [that i] [could [have] a] [much] bigger [family] [. i] . [could have] [been] [a lot] richer . thats why _i [have_ [a] family] _. it_ isnt really [my] fault 
A|99| B: [but] [you know] [like] four [i] [mean] four children [is] expensive especially when [you] consider [like] especially [for] me which _i'm paying_ out [of] state tuition . _i'm paying_ [you know] three thousand _no_ [what] [is] [it] two thousand six hundred dollars [for] _one_ semester . 
B|100| M: [i'm paying] . 
A|101| B: [and] [you know] people [say] [you know] [it's] expensive [to] [think] [it's] college [but] [if] [if] everybody would [be] [a little] bit responsible [you know] [it's] [like] [what] [does] [it] [what] [does] [it] cost [. it] costs five hundred dollars [a] semester suppose . [now] [they] [go to a] state college [and] [they] [live] at _home_ [you know] 
B|102| M: [no] 
A|103| B: [and] [well] [it] costs two hundred dollars [for] books [but] [you know] seven hundred dollars [a] semester [a lot] [of] people [can] spare [that] [if] [they] planned ahead [you know] [like] 
B|104| M:  ... 
A|105| B: [i] [mean] [it's] [like] [if] [you] plan [a] year ahead [you can] probably save up seven hundred dollars [you know] _one_ thousand four hundred dollars [to] send [your] child [to] college [you know] . 
B|106| M: [yeah]

B|120| M: [i'm] going [back [to] the] future . 
A|121| B: [like] [you] [don't have any money] [to] [to get] out . 
B|122| M: [i don't] . 
A|123| B: [so] [uh] [and] [uh] [i was] thinking [you know] [like] [oh] [my] god [you [know] [i] _go] back_ there [and] then [and i] [get] _married_ there [and] [now] [i [have] kids] there [and] then [i'll] [never] [leave] [the] place [you know] . 
B|124| M: [but] [you're] [married] [so] [you] don'have [to go back .] 
A|125| B: [yeah] [i know] [and] _that's_ _that's_ [what] happened [to] [my] brother . [he] came [to school] up [here] [and] then when [he] [went] down there [he] [was] [just] [so] bad off [you know] [from] [not] being able [to] [stay] up [here] [that] his life [just] [went] down [the] drain . 
B|126| M:  ... 
A|127| B: [so .] 
B|128| M: [that's] [how] [you] [get] . 
A|129| B: [yeah] [i've been] calling [a lot] [of] companies . there some [of] them [are] interested . [well] at least [for a] year [and] [a] half [i] [can] work 
B|130| M: [well] [you're] [not] [the] [only] [one] . 
A|131| B: [so .] 
B|132| M: [it's] [been] [pretty] [good] . 
A|133| B: all _right_ [same] [here] . 
B|134| M: [you're] [right .]
