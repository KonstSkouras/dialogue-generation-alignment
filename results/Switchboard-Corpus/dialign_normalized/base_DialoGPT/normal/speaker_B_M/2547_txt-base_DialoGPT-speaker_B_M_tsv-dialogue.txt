A|32| B: _yes ._ 
B|33| M: [you] _mean_ [like] _in dallas_ ? 
A|34| B: uh-huh 
B|35| M: _uh _i_ think_ [the] economy [is] _good_ [so] _i'm not_ _sure_ what's going [on] . 
A|36| B: [well] pensacola has [it's] really _is a_ buyer's market there now 
B|37| M: i'd [say] [the] pensaclippers [are] _the most expensive_ team [in the] state . 
A|38| B: _and_ [it] isn't because [of the] [well] there has [been] [a] lot [of] speculative building . [uh _i] _don't_ know_ perhaps [not] [in dallas] 
B|39| M: [i don't] _think_ _it is ._ [it's a] fact . 
A|40| B: [but] [uh] [i'm] [sure] people [in] [uh] [you know] [in] [uh] galveston _and_ [so] forth _would_ _be_ knowledgeable about [it] [uh] pensacola _is _a_ navy_ town . 
B|41| M: i've never [been] [to] galvesto [i'm] _just_ [not] [sure] _if [i_ would] ever [be] [in [a] navy] ship .

B|43| M: [well] [i'm] [in] galvesto . 
A|44| B: [they] were expecting [an] influx [of] _something_ [on] [the] order [of] fifty thousand people _or_ more [from the] [navy] 
B|45| M:  ... [i don't] _get_ _it ._ 
A|46| B: [a] new carrier _was_ coming [in] _and_ [uh] [the] [uh] attendant [uh] support vessels . _well that's_ [no] longer [the] case . 
B|47| M:  ... [what] [was] [the] plan ? 
A|48| B: _oh_ [it's] [it is .] [i] [mean] [the] _the number_ [of] single family units [on] sale [is] phenomenal compared [to] [the] population . 
B|49| M: [you] _do_ realize _that's not_ [what] [they] [mean] _right_ ? 
A|50| B: _and_ [so] overbuilding [is] has [been] [a] real problem there . 
B|51| M: [yeah] [the number] [is a] _bit_ _high ._ 
A|52| B: [so] [you] can still [get] [a] [get] [a] [a] [good] [house] for [a] very very reasonable price . _and_ [i] [mean] [good] [i would] let's [say] typical [say] three bedroom [uh] two _and_ [a] half baths [on] [a] half acre _or_ [so] [of] land [uh] reasonable construction [would] _probably_ run [you] [uh] [right] now anywhere between somewhere between [a] hundred _and_ [a] hundred _and_ forty thousand _dollars_ . _and_ _probably_ perhaps cheaper depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
B|53| M: 500 
A|54| B: [what] about your home ? 
B|55| M: [well that's] 
A|56| B: uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [i'm] sorry . 
A|58| B: uh-huh . 
B|59| M: what's [the] rent [like] ? 
A|60| B: nor [do] [we] [but] 
B|61| M: uhh [i] don t [know] 
A|62| B: uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [i'm] pretty [sure] [the] [house] [was] made [in the] 70's . 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: hehuh . 
A|66| B: [right] . 
B|67| M: er [uh] 
A|68| B: [well] [the] housing here [in] maryland [is] [just] atrocious . _and_ [in] [in the] entire d c area _. i'm_ [i'm] only about [uh] twelve miles _or_ [so] [from the] [uh] border [of] washington d c _and_ montgomery county maryland [is] _probably_ one [of [the] most expensive] places [to] 
B|69| M:  ? 
A|70| B: [no] [we are] west . 
B|71| M: [you know] ? 
A|72| B: sevren [is] east near [the] eastern shore 
B|73| M: [i don't] [get] _it ._ 
A|74| B: [if i] had 
B|75| M: [i] wouldn't 
A|76| B: uh-huh . 
B|77| M: sev ren ? 
A|78| B: _oh_ [that's not] unusual [yeah] . 
B|79| M: [it's] [like] [a million dollars] [or] [something] . 
A|80| B: [well that's] [that] area over there [is] [not] as [expensive] as [in the] [the] immediate [you know] washington area . 
B|81| M: [the] then . 
A|82| B: _and_ [so] [we] [uh i] [was] [just] looking for example there [is a] [uh] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex where [i] live _and_ [i] [was] over there recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] two bedroom condominium . _and_ ninety-two thousand [dollars] for [a] two bedroom which [is] essentially [a] two bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: i'mverysmart 
A|84| B: now [it] [was] very nicely done . 
B|85| M: [that was] quite nice [of you] . 
A|86| B: [i would] [have] thought 
B|87| M: [that was] [the] plan [yes .] 
A|88| B: [yes .] [i] [i] can't [i] can't envision spending [that] [much money] _and_ [on] [on] [something] along those lines . 
B|89| M: _did_ [you] [not] watch [the] video ? 
A|90| B: [so] [you know] [it's] [i] guess [you] pay [the] piper [but] plus [the] [the] [the] taxes around here [are] phenomenally [high .] 
B|91| M: [no] [i don't] . 
A|92| B: [uh] for [the] _and_ [so] [you] [on] [that] [it's not] unusual for example for somewhere around here [on] [a] [on] [a] [on] [a] [what] [we] [would] [you _know] what_ [you] described as your [house] _and_ [what] [i would] describe as my [house] [say] for example [in] pensacola florida [on] [that] [house] with [the] homestead exemption _and_ [so] forth _and_ [so] [on] might pay three [or] four hundred [dollars] [a] year taxes . maybe [you know] maybe [a] little [bit] higher than [that] now 
B|93| M: [i] 
A|94| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] here you'd pay almost six thousand [dollars] [a] year taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: [you] [probably] . 
A|96| B: [so] [it's] [uh] [so] [the] question [of] whether [to] buy here [or] move [to] another county [say] drive twenty more miles north buy [a] condominium for approximately [uh] [the same] price maybe [a] little lower [but] [the] taxes [would] [be] [you know] perhaps maybe one-third [uh] [of] 
B|97| M: [to] [that's] [a] [house] 
A|98| B: _oh_ absolutely . [yeah] 
B|99| M: [oh] [i] [see] . [so] [if] [you] [don't] mind me asking [what] 
A|100| B: [so] [it's] [it's] really sad 
B|101| M: [well] _i'm not_ even [a] guy [and] i've [been] told [it's a] joke . 
A|102| B: this [is] one this [is] one [of [the] most] highly taxed areas [in the] country . 
B|103| M: [i'm] [in the] uk [. _i'm] not_ [a] citizen . 
A|104| B: [well] [they] [it] [the] their [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good] such things as extremely [good] _school_ systems for example . [it] has one [of the] best _school_ systems [in the] country . 
B|105| M: why [do] [you] _think_ [they] [have] [so] many problems ? 
A|106| B: [uh] [and] because [the] cost [of] living around here [is] [so] [high] 
B|107| M: why [is] [that] ? 
A|108| B: _public_ employees make great salaries around here 
B|109| M: [but] [i'm] [from the] uk . 
A|110| B: [i] [was] reading [just] recently where [the] typical administrator [in the] montgomery county _public_ schools makes [and] [i'm not] this [is] [uh] [the] figure he makes eighty thousand [dollars] [a] year . 
B|111| M: [you] [don't [know] what] [a] [public] employee [is] ? 
A|112| B: [that's] 
B|113| M: [i'm not] [i'm] [a] private [school] teacher . 
A|114| B: [and] [i] by administrator [i] [i think] [i] [mean i] [they] didn't [they] [did] [not] define [it] [but] for example [a] curriculum supervisor [or] principal [or] someone [you know] [in] [that] [uh] [in] [that] range .
