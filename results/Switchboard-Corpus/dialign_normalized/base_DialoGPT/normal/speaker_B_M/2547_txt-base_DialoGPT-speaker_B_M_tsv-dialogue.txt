B|43| M: [well [,] i'm] [in] galvesto . 
A|44| B: [they] were expecting [an] influx [of] _something_ [on] [the] order [of] fifty thousand people _or_ more [from the] [navy] , 
B|45| M:  ... [i don't] _get_ _it ._ 
A|46| B: [a] new carrier _was_ coming [in] _and_ [, uh [,] _the] [,_ uh ,] attendant [, uh ,] support vessels . _well , that's_ [no] longer [, the] case . 
B|47| M:  ... [what] [was] [the] plan ? 
A|48| B: _oh [,_ it's] , [it is .] [i] [mean [,] _the] _,_ the number_ [of] single family units [on] sale [is] phenomenal compared [to] [the] population . 
B|49| M: [you] _do_ realize _that's not_ [what] [they] [mean _,] right_ ? 
A|50| B: _and_ [so] overbuilding [is] , has [been] [a] real problem there . 
B|51| M: _yeah [,_ the number] [is a] _bit_ _high ._ 
A|52| B: [so] [you] can still [get] [a] , [get] [a] _, a_ [good] [house] for [a] very , very reasonable price . _and_ [i] [mean] [good [,] [i] would] , let's [say] typical , [say] three bedroom [, uh ,] two _and_ [a] half baths , [on] [a] half acre _or_ [so] [of] land [uh ,] reasonable construction [would] _probably_ run _you [,_ uh [,] right] now anywhere between , somewhere between [a] hundred _and_ [a] hundred _and_ forty thousand _dollars_ . _and_ _probably_ , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
B|53| M: 500 
A|54| B: [what] about your home ? 
B|55| M: [well , that's] 
A|56| B: uh-huh . 
B|57| M: [i'm] sorry . 
A|58| B: uh-huh . 
B|59| M: what's [the] rent [like] ? 
A|60| B: nor [do] [we] , [but] , 
B|61| M: uhh [, i] don t [know ,] 
A|62| B: uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [i'm] pretty [sure] [the] [house] [was] made [in the] 70's . 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: hehuh . 
A|66| B: [right] . 
B|67| M: er [uh] 
A|68| B: [well [,] the] housing here [in] maryland [is] [just] atrocious . _and_ [in] [, [in] the] entire d c area _. i'm_ [, i'm] only about [, uh ,] twelve miles _or_ [so] [from _the] [,_ uh ,] border [of] washington d c _, and_ montgomery county , maryland [is] _probably_ one [of [the] most expensive] , places [to ,] 
B|69| M:  ? 
A|70| B: _no [,_ we are] west . 
B|71| M: [you know] ? 
A|72| B: sevren [is] east , near [the] eastern shore , 
B|73| M: [i don't] [get] _it ._ 
A|74| B: [if i] had , 
B|75| M: [i ,] wouldn't , 
A|76| B: uh-huh . 
B|77| M: sev ren ? 
A|78| B: _oh [,_ [that's] not] unusual , [yeah] . 
B|79| M: [it's] [like] [a million dollars] [or] [something] . 
A|80| B: [well _, that's] ,_ [that] area over there [is] [not] as [expensive] as [in _the] [,_ the] immediate [, you know ,] washington area . 
B|81| M: [the ,] then . 
A|82| B: _and_ _so [,_ we] [, [uh ,] i] [was] [just] looking , for example there [is a] [, uh ,] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex where [i] live _, and_ [i] [was] over there recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] two bedroom condominium . _and_ ninety-two thousand [dollars] for [a] two bedroom , which [is] essentially [a] two bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: i'mverysmart 
A|84| B: now , [it] [was] very nicely done . 
B|85| M: [that was] quite nice [of] [you] . 
A|86| B: [i would] [have] thought , 
B|87| M: [that was] [the] plan , [yes .] 
A|88| B: [yes .] [i [,] i] can't [, i] can't envision spending [that] [much money] _, and_ [on] , [on] [something] along those lines . 
B|89| M: _did_ [you] [not] watch [the] video ? 
A|90| B: _so [,_ you know [,] it's] [, i] guess [you] pay [the] piper [but] , plus [the [,] [the] [,] the] taxes around here [are] phenomenally , [high .] 
B|91| M: [no [,] i don't] . 
A|92| B: [uh ,] for [the _,] and_ _so [,_ _you] ,_ [on] [that] [it's not] unusual , for example , for somewhere around here [on] [a] , [on] [a] , [on] [a] _, what_ [we] [would] [, you know _,] what_ [you] described as your [house] _and_ [what] [i would] describe as my [house] [say] , for example [, in] pensacola , florida , [on] [that] [house] with [the] homestead exemption _and_ [so] forth _and_ [so] [on] , might pay three [or] four hundred [dollars] [a] year taxes . maybe [, you know ,] maybe [a] little [bit] higher than [that] now , 
B|93| M: [i] 
A|94| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] here , you'd pay almost six thousand [dollars] [a] year , taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: [you [,] probably] . 
A|96| B: _so [,_ it's] [, uh [,] _so] [,_ the] question [of] whether [to] buy here [or] move [to] another county , [say] , drive twenty more miles north , buy [a] condominium for approximately [, uh [,] [the] same] price , maybe [a] little lower , [but] [the] taxes [would] [be] [, you know ,] perhaps , maybe one-third [uh ,] [of] , 
B|97| M: [to [,] that's [,] a] [house] 
A|98| B: _oh ,_ absolutely . [yeah ,] 
B|99| M: [oh [,] i] [see] . [so ,] [if] [you] [don't] mind me asking [, what] 
A|100| B: [so [,] it's] [, it's] really sad 
B|101| M: [well [,] _i'm] not_ even [a] guy [, and] i've [been] told [it's a] joke . 
A|102| B: this [is] one , this [is] one [of [the] most] highly taxed areas [in the] country . 
B|103| M: [i'm] [in the] uk [. _i'm] not_ [a] citizen . 
A|104| B: [well ,] [they] [it] [, [the] ,] their , [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good ,] such things as extremely [good] _school_ systems , for example . [it] has one [of the] best _school_ systems [in the] country . 
B|105| M: why [do] [you] _think_ [they] [have] [so] many problems ? 
A|106| B: [uh [,] and] because [the] cost [of] living around here [is] [so] [high] , 
B|107| M: why [is] [that] ? 
A|108| B: _public_ employees make great salaries around here 
B|109| M: [but] [i'm] [from the] uk . 
A|110| B: [i] [was] reading [just] recently where [the] typical administrator [in [the] ,] montgomery county _public_ schools makes [, and] _i'm not ,_ this [is] [, uh [,] the] figure , he makes eighty thousand [dollars] [a] year . 
B|111| M: [you] [don't know] [what] [a] [public] employee [is] ? 
A|112| B: [that's ,] 
B|113| M: [i'm not [,] i'm] [a] private [school] teacher . 
A|114| B: [and] [i ,] by administrator [i [,] i think] [i] [mean [, i] ,] [they] didn't , [they] [did] [not] define [it] , [but] for example [, a] curriculum supervisor [or] principal [or] someone [, you know [,] in] [that] [, uh [,] in] [that] range .
