B|33| M: _what_ _do_ _you_ mean ? 
A|34| B: _so_ [i] find _that_ _it_ makes up [for] [what] [i] [pay for] _insurance_ and [i] _, i_ make enough _money_ by [the] hour [to] make up [for] _that ._ 
B|35| M: _it's_ [because] you're [not] getting any [benefits]

B|39| M: ah , [so] _you have to_ [pay] more [than] [the] cost [of] [the] [job] ? 
A|40| B: and then _i have_ _my_ freedom . [i can] _work_ seven days [in] [a] row and take [a] _week_ off or whatever [i] want _to do_ . 
B|41| M: [the] only _thing_ [i can] _think_ [of] _is_ _you_ being _paid_ [for] your time . 
A|42| B: _well ,_ _it_ [is] [to] me . most people prefer [the] security [of] nine [to] five , and weekends off and knowing _that_ their _insurance_ [is] [paid] and their _retirement ,_ 
B|43| M: _i'm just_ [not] sure how [it] would be financially wise [to do] [that .] 
A|44| B: and [i'm just] _really_ [not] interested [in] all [that .] 
B|45| M: _i think_ [it's] mostly [the] first one .

A|52| B: then [i think] [it] makes [a] big difference . 
B|53| M: [i think] [the] group discount [is] [a little] more important [than] [that .] 
A|54| B: [yeah .] 
B|55| M: [do] _you have to_ be [a] parent [to] [have a] [job] ? 
A|56| B: right .

B|69| M: [i] mean [, it's] [just] an example . 
A|70| B: _i just_ prefer [to] worry [about] _today_ , probably [not] [a] practical attitude but that's [who] [i] am [so] , 
B|71| M: [i don't] [really] care [about] [my] [retirement [,] [i'm] just] here [for] [the] [money] . 
A|72| B: uh-huh .
