B|19| M:  
A|20| B: [they] [, they] charged [you] by , by weight [of] how much trash [you] were actually sending _to_ [a] land fill .

A|22| B: [that] [that] might be [a] better way _to_ [do] [it .] 
B|23| M: [you] could [use] [a] yard sale or something . 
A|24| B: _and_ then [people] would , would _know_ [that] [it] _was_ going _to_ cost [them] _money_ _to_ [not] sort _their_ trash . 
B|25| M: [they] could _just_ put [a] filter on [it .]

B|27| M: [it's] [a bit] [of] [a] dilemma . 
A|28| B: uh-huh . 
B|29| M: ya .... 
A|30| B: oh , [yeah] that's [about] [the same] kind [of] _thing ._
