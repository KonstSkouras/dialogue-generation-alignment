A|2| B: _oh ,_ wow . 
B|3| M: _it's_ _an_ _old_ _car ._ 
A|4| B: _well _,_ i_ really , _the_ last [car] _we_ _got_ _was a_ , _was _a_ used_ [car _.] i_ really _don't_ prefer buying _a new_ [car _.] _i_ like_ _to_ let somebody _else_ pay _for_ _that_ 
B|5| M: _i'm_ _not_ _sure_ _i'd_ ever _buy [a_ used] vehicle , especially [a used] _one_ . 
A|6| B: _but _,_ uh_ mine _was a_ year [old] , 
B|7| M: [well _,] i've_ _got [a_ new] _one_ [for] _you_ . 
A|8| B: _and_ _we_ _bought_ _it_ [for] very functional purposes , 
B|9| M: _that's_ _not_ [the] point _of the_ post 
A|10| B: _and_ _that_ _was_ _we_ _bought_ [a] station wagon . _we_ wanted [an] economical [car] _to_ operate , 
B|11| M: uhh ... _no ,_ _they don't_ . 
A|12| B: _but_ _we_ wanted [one] _that_ could carry _a lot of_ equipment . _so_ , _we_ chose _a nissan_ stanza wagon . 
B|13| M: uuhuh . _why ?_ 
A|14| B: _and_ _i've never_ _been _sorry_ ,_ 
B|15| M: [i've] [been sorry] 
A|16| B: however [the] need [for] _that_ kind [of] [car] has changed now , 
B|17| M: _i'm_ [sorry] . 
A|18| B: _and _,_ uh _,_ while_ _it is_ _still good ,_ _and_ [it's] quite serviceable , _and_ _i'll_ drive _it_ until _it_ [no] longer _is_ _reliable ._ 
B|19| M: [and [,] while] [it's] [still good ,] _it's not_ [reliable .] 
A|20| B: [and] probably then some _i'll_ spend _a lot of time_ praying over _it_ _before_ _i_ give _it_ up . 
B|21| M: ugh . _i'm_ [sorry ,] _but _i_ don't_ _think_ [it's] worth [the] trouble . 
A|22| B: _i think_ _that_ [i] would _like_ _to_ _, if _you_ know ,_ _we_ all _say_ _, if_ [i] could _have _the_ car_ [i] always wanted [i] would either [buy _a] nissan_ maxima _, uh ,_ 
B|23| M: _you're_ _just_ asking [for] _it ._ 
A|24| B: [i'm] sold _on_ nissans . 
B|25| M: [a _nissan] is_ _not_ _the best_ [car .] 
A|26| B: [i] [a] or , or foreign _cars_ actually _. uh ,_ 
B|27| M: _what about_ ? 
A|28| B: _uh ,_ 
B|29| M: [i _like] _the_ _nissan_ ._ 
A|30| B: its reliability . 
B|31| M: [i] [have] [never] heard _that ._ 
A|32| B: its reliability . [and _,] uh , i _,_ you know [,_ i've] read all [the] _consumer_ reports [and] things , [and] [they] [just] run head [and] shoulders above [the] american made _cars_ . _if_ _ford_ _was a_ head [and] [the] shoulders above [it] , [i'd] [buy _a] ford_ . 
B|33| M: [but] ... [but] ... [but] [ford] ... 
A|34| B: [but _i] had_ _, uh ,_ _had _a_ ford_ escort [that] absolutely needed taps [the] day _we_ _got [it_ .] 
B|35| M: _and you_ [had a] pontiac aztek _in the_ 80's . 
A|36| B: _uh _,_ you know , i_ mean _it was_ ready [for] [the] graveyard . 
B|37| M: _it's not_ [like] [i [had] a] chance [to] [say] _that ,_ _it's just_ 
A|38| B: [and] _i spent_ as much _on that_ [car] [in] twelve months as _i spent_ [for] _the [car_ .] 
B|39| M: [i spent] [a lot of time] [on that] game . 
A|40| B: _so_ , 
B|41| M: _but [, you know ,_ i] _was ._ 
A|42| B: [and] [that] [was] [just] trying [to] hold us , getting _out_ [of] [that] _was [a_ used] [car .] 
B|43| M: [well ,] _it's not_ [like] [we] _have a_ choice . 
A|44| B: [and] _it was_ [an] older [car] , 
B|45| M: [i think] _you _have_ a_ problem 
A|46| B: [but , you know ,] escort [is] supposed [to] [have _a] great_ track record as far as sales . 
B|47| M: _i don't_ [think] they'll _be_ cheap . _i'd rather have _a_ car_ _with_ [a great] history _than _a_ car_ _that's_ [been] abused [and] abused [for] _years_ . 
A|48| B: [but] [it's just] _, it_ [just] [was] [not] [and you] get stung [a] [time] or _two_ , 
B|49| M: [but] [you know [,] [it] [was] _a] car_ 
A|50| B: [and you] [say] , [no] thanks . 
B|51| M: _it's not_ [a] scam , [it's] [a] deal 
A|52| B: _so_ [, i] [just] trusted [the] _consumer_ reports [and] [the] auto _, uh ,_ reports 
B|53| M: _yeah [._ _i] [got_ it] from [a] [consumer] . 
A|54| B: [had] _my_ son who knows [a lot] [about] [that ,] study them thoroughly , [and] _he_ gave me four choices [of] _cars_ [to] [buy] 
B|55| M: [i think] _you're_ confusing this _with_ [the car] [he] [bought] . 
A|56| B: [an] escort definitely [was] [not] among them . [in] fact , there wasn't [an] american [car] [in] there . 
B|57| M: _i got_ an'04 mustang [. [i] think] _the best_ [car] [i've] ever owned [was [a] nissan] gt _r_ . 
A|58| B: _uh ,_ [the nissan] came [and ,] [and] [we] [bought] [the nissan] [for] functional purposes [not] [what] [the] [consumer] reports said [we] should get . 
B|59| M: awwww . [my] _nissan ._ 
A|60| B: [but] [it] served our needs _. uh ,_ later [on] his reports , [the] reports [that] [he] studied showed [that _,] uh ,_ [nissan] [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in the] [in the] class [that] [we] were _looking for_ . [and] [that ,] [and] [i'd rather have a] maxima [than a] cadillac [. i] really would . [it's not] necessarily prestige , 
B|61| M: [i'm] [so] tired . 
A|62| B: [but] [it's] comfort _. uh ,_ there's [a lot of] features [on] there [that] _are_ desirable _if_ [you're] _going to_ pay [that] kind [of] money [for] [a [car] _.] uh ,_ 
B|63| M: uhhh 
A|64| B: [nissan .] 
B|65| M: [what] [is] [the] difference between [a ford] gt [and] 
A|66| B: _no . [no_ ,] _no ._ [nissan is] _japanese_ . 
B|67| M: [no . [no] . [no] . [no] . [no] .] 
A|68| B: uh-huh , uh-huh , 
B|69| M: [japanese] [nissan] ? 
A|70| B: uh-huh . 
B|71| M:  
A|72| B: [yeah .] [and _,] uh _,_ if_ [i] couldn't [have] [my] luxury maxima then [i'd] [buy] me [a] fancy little red c [r] x sports [car] 
B|73| M: uhuhuh . [you know [,] if you] _can't_ afford [a] ferrari [, you] [don't] _have to_ . 
A|74| B: [i] mean [, you know ,] every every [one] [of] us _have two_ sides 
B|75| M: [so] _you [have_ two] [cars] ? 
A|76| B: [yeah .] now [what about] [you] [, if you] could _have [the_ car] [that] [you] wanted [what] would [you] get 
B|77| M: [yeah] , [but i] _can't_ afford [it .] 
A|78| B: [and] [why ?] 
B|79| M: [but] ... [you] _can't_ [have the] cat 
A|80| B: uh-huh . 
B|81| M: [what] ? 
A|82| B: uh-huh , uh-huh . [yeah .] see there , 
B|83| M: [yeah .] um . 
A|84| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|85| M: uhh ... [uh] ... [uh] ? 
A|86| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh [. i] tell [you] [that's] sad too because there [one] [time] [ford] [was] [the best] , [that] [was] made . 
B|87| M: uuhuhuh . uuhuh uhuhuh 
A|88| B: really [was .] 
B|89| M: [it was] 
A|90| B: [and _,] uh , i [,_ i] really [have] [not] seen , now [a lot [of] the] american [cars] actually _are_ , _are_ , parts _are_ produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled _here_ or vice versa . 
B|91| M: [i [,] uh , i [,] uh] 
A|92| B: [of] course . 
B|93| M: [are] [you] interested _in the car_ ? 
A|94| B: _okay_ [uh ,] at any rate _do [you_ have] color preferences or [what] would [be] [the] features [that] [you] would [be] _looking for_ ? 
B|95| M: [no ,] [i'm] fine . [i'm] [just] [not] [looking for] _anything_ specific . 
A|96| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|97| M: hmmm [, you] ? 
A|98| B: uh-huh , uh-huh . [yeah .] _oh ,_ wow . [we] [like the] stuff [that] glitters 
B|99| M: [uh ,] yes . 
A|100| B: [good] . there's nothing wrong [with] [that .] actually [i think] probably [if] [i] were _going to_ get [if] [i] were _going to_ [be] practical , which doesn't mean [i] would [be] [, i] would prefer white . because , simply because [it's] more visible at night . 
B|101| M: um ... [uh] ... [yeah .] 
A|102| B: [and ,] uh-huh . uh-huh . now [the] interior , _okay [,_ [i] don't] care [about] [the] interior [just] as long as [it's not] black or red . 
B|103| M: [uh] 
A|104| B: [but] [if] [i had] [the] little red c [r] x [, i] guess [the] interior would [have to] [be] black leather [and] [i'd] [have to] live [with] [that .] [and] [if] [i got] [the] c [r] x [it] would [have to] [have a] real [good] sound system [in] [it] because [i'd] want [that] too . 
B|105| M: huh 
A|106| B: [i'd] [just] _go back_ _to my_ teenage [years] [and] [just] throw all [my] experience [to] [the] wind 
B|107| M:  
A|108| B: uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [you know , i] _can_ [go back] [and] talk [to my] friends . 
A|110| B: uh-huh .

A|112| B: [that's] _okay_ . 
B|113| M: um . huh . 
A|114| B: [no ,] [no ,] [no [.] i] generally would [uh ,] prefer [to] _listen to_ [, uh ,] [well [,] i] _listen to_ k c b [i] [a lot] [but i] will _listen to_ [the] news [and] [the] , [and] [the] traffic [and] those things at work . 
B|115| M: [okay ,] um , [i'll] [be] [here] . 
A|116| B: [but] [if] [i'm going to] [be] traveling [in] [that] [car] [for] any period [of time] [, i] want some real [good] _classical music_ . 
B|117| M: hmmm [. [uh ,] i] dunno . 
A|118| B: _i love_ _classical music_ , [and you] [just] [can't] enjoy [it] unless you've [got a] [good] sound system [to] produce all [the] , all [the] characteristics [of the] instruments . 
B|119| M:  
A|120| B: [so] [i] _do_ _love_ _classical music_ or [it] or , or [, uh ,] contemporary _classical_ . 
B|121| M: [what] [do you] [love] [about] [classical music] ? 
A|122| B: uh-huh . 
B|123| M: [what] [is] this , [a] crossover episode ? 
A|124| B: [sure] [do] . 
B|125| M: [oh ,] hey . 
A|126| B: w [r] [r] [and] _the oasis_ [are] [the] [two] [that] [i] _listen to_ , more [than] _anything else_ . 
B|127| M: [do you] [listen to] [anything else] ? 
A|128| B: [and] [i] [do] [like] them . [and] _i'd like_ [to] [have a] _compact disc_ player [in the [car] .] [that] would [be] , something [that] [i] would really [like] . 
B|129| M: [i'd [like] [the] oasis] 
A|130| B: those _compact_ discs , really [are] [good] [for] [cars] because [they don't] melt , 
B|131| M: [i [like] the] ones [that] come [with] [the] ones [i] [bought] . 
A|132| B: [they don't] warp . 
B|133| M: [i] [have a] nice [compact disc] [, [i] love] [it [.] [i] don't] [think] [it is] worth [the] price . 
A|134| B: [you know ,] there's nothing [in] there [that] [can] wrap around [the] , [the] [, uh ,] rollers or [anything] . [it] seems [like] [a] really [good] answer [to] portable [music] , [that] [you] [can] choose . 
B|135| M: [i've never] heard [of] this [before] , [but i] [can't] help [but] wonder [what] [it is] .
