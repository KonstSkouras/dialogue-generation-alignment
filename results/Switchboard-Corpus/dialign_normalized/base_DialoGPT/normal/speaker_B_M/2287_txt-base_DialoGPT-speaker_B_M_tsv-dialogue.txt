A|48| B: [and] _the polls are_ open , [what] [was] _it ,_ [a] couple [of] weeks [, the] hours _are_ [good] [and] _they're_ even open on saturdays [and] [a] couple [of] sundays . 
B|49| M: [i _know ,] i'm_ [just] saying [, you] can't [have] [a] referendum [, but [you] can] [have] [a] [vote .] 
A|50| B: [and] [so] we've got plenty [of _time] to_ go _, because_ down [here] [in] houston [, it's [,] uh [,] the] lines _are_ long . 
B|51| M: [yeah [,] but] [they'll] [have] [time to] finish [the] [race] . 
A|52| B: [so , uh [,] but] [, uh ,] 
B|53| M: [the people] [i know] [are] from dallas , texas [, and] _i'm_ [not] from dallas . 
A|54| B: _well [, uh ,_ i] recommend _it , because_ [you] [just] walk [right] on [in] [, and] [there's] usually [not] anybody [in] line 
B|55| M: [well , uh ,] i'd [like] [to] [do] [that] . 
A|56| B: [and [,] uh [,] you know [,] that] vote's [just] as [good] as [, you know [,] the] one on _election_ day . 
B|57| M: _i've_ voted [in] [a] [few] [election] days [, but] _i'm_ still [not] going _to [vote_ .] 
A|58| B: uh-huh [, yeah] . 
B|59| M: [the] first [two] [are] easy [, but] _i'm_ [not] sure _about the_ third . 
A|60| B: um [, yeah [,] i've been] involved with [, uh ,] _some_ [of the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of the] , [of the] republican party . [and] [it's] really interesting [to] see [the] process as far as [what] goes through as far as [the] voting [and] [the] [, uh ,] [how] [the] [, uh [,] the] _not the_ ballots [, but] [, uh ,] my mind has gone blank . [i've been] all evening [how] _they_ develop [, uh ,] [what] [the] [candidate] stands [for] 
B|61| M:  
A|62| B: [you know [,] the] views [, and [,] uh [,] you know ,] everybody gets [to vote] on [, you know ,] [well ,] should _he_ be [for] this [and] on [and] on [and] on [, and [,] uh [,] it's [,] it's] interesting . 
B|63| M: [we do [,] you] , 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [you] [, and] . 
A|66| B: [right .] [there] [for] [a] while [, that] would [, that] worked . we've [, uh , i know] [i] [have] , um , _i'll_ stick [to] [uh ,] _to the_ [, you know ,] sometimes _i'll_ stick [to] [a] certain party , depends on [the guy] . 
B|67| M: _i'll ,_ 
A|68| B: [but] [, uh ,] _if_ _it [,_ uh ,] gets down between [two] , then [i'll ,] [i'll] [vote [for] the] party _because_ [i know [, you] know ,] something [about the] other [guy] 
B|69| M: [oh , yeah] 
A|70| B: or [, you know ,] _they're_ both [just] as bad [, and] [i'll] say , [well [,] i [know] what] this [guy] stands [for] as far as [for] his party [, and ,] um [, but] [yeah] . [you know _,] that's_ _not the_ best way [but] , 
B|71| M: _yes [,_ that's] [, [that] [,] that] . 
A|72| B: [but] [it] gets _to the_ point where [, i mean ,] you've got _to have_ [the] find [the] [time] also [to] read [about [the] guy] [and , and] be able [to] find [the] _information_ [about] [what] _he_ stands [for] . 
B|73| M: [yes .] 
A|74| B: [right] , or [what] you've heard on t v , which _i think_ [is] [just] outrageous . 
B|75| M: [i don't [know] what] [you] 
A|76| B: [i] [, [i] don't] agree with [how] _the media_ handles elections . 
B|77| M: [we] [have to have] [a good] story [to [the] people] [of] iceland . 
A|78| B: [i] [, you [know ,] i'm] tired [of] hearing [about _the] polls_ [, you [know [,] you] know ,] this [is] [how] _he_ stands such [and] such [a] day [the] way _they_ break [it] out , 
B|79| M: [yes [.] [the] polls are] [what we] call [a] joke . 
A|80| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
B|81| M: [you] can't tell me [what] [to] _do ._ 
A|82| B: uh-huh , [it] really could [, and [,] uh ,] then , [how] , sometimes , [how] _the media_ will blow things out [of] proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] [good] [and] dead [, and] _they_ keep dragging [it] on [, and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an [election] [for [the] guy] [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [he] . 
A|84| B: [yeah ,] [so , uh ,] 
B|85| M: [i think] [it's] funny [that] [they're] doing [it , because] [they're] [the media] [, [not] the] 
A|86| B: _they_ really [do [.] i] [, i] sometimes [think] [that] [that] should be limited more . 
B|87| M: [the media] [is] pretty much [the] only thing [that] [can get] [him] [elected] . 
A|88| B: [oh ,] [yes ,] or _they_ [, i] agree with [the] _freedom [of_ the] press [, you know [,] and] all [the] amendments [, but] sometimes [it's] [for the] public's own [good] [that] [we] [don't] hear things . 
B|89| M: [well [,] you] [have to] admit [that they] [have] [some] [freedom of] [information] . 
A|90| B: [no] , [they] [don't] . 
B|91| M: [i] am [not] sure [if] [they] care . 
A|92| B: [well [,] i] enjoyed [talking] [to] [you] . 
B|93| M: [you] [are] [a good] man . 
A|94| B: all [right .] 
B|95| M: [i] guess you're [right .]
