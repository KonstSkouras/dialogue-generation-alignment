A|58| B: uh-huh [yeah] . 
B|59| M: [the] first [two] [are] easy [but] _i'm_ [not] sure _about the_ third . 
A|60| B: um [yeah] [i've been] involved with [uh] _some_ [of the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of the] [of the] republican party . [and it's] really interesting [to] see [the] process as far as [what] goes through as far as [the] voting [and] [the] [uh] [how] [the] [uh] [the] _not the_ ballots [but] [uh] my mind has gone blank . [i've been] all evening [how] _they_ develop [uh] [what] [the] [candidate] stands [for] 
B|61| M:  
A|62| B: [you know] [the] views [and] [uh] [you know] everybody gets [to vote] on [you know] [well] should _he_ be [for] this [and] on [and] on [and] on [and] [uh] [it's] [it's] interesting . 
B|63| M: [we do] [you] 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [you] [and] . 
A|66| B: [right .] [there] [for] [a] while [that] would [that] worked . we've [uh i know] [i] [have] um _i'll_ stick [to] [uh] _to the_ [you know] sometimes _i'll_ stick [to] [a] certain party depends on [the guy] . 
B|67| M: [i'll] 
A|68| B: [but] [uh] _if_ [it] [uh] gets down between [two] then [i'll] [i'll] [vote [for] the] party _because_ [i know [you] know] something [about the] other [guy] 
B|69| M: [oh yeah] 
A|70| B: or [you know] _they're_ both [just] as bad [and] [i'll] say [well] [i [know] what] this [guy] stands [for] as far as [for] his party [and] um [but] [yeah] . [you know] [that's] _not the_ best way [but] 
B|71| M: [yes] [that's] _that that_ . 
A|72| B: [but] [it] gets _to the_ point where [i mean] you've got _to have_ [the] find [the] [time] also [to] read [about [the] guy] [and and] be able [to] find [the] _information_ [about] [what] _he_ stands [for] . 
B|73| M: [yes .] 
A|74| B: [right] or [what] you've heard on t v which _i think_ [is] [just] outrageous . 
B|75| M: [i don't [know] what] [you] 
A|76| B: [i] [i don't] agree with [how] _the media_ handles elections . 
B|77| M: [we] [have to have] [a good] story [to [the] people] [of] iceland . 
A|78| B: [i] [you [know] i'm] tired [of] hearing [about _the] polls_ [you [know] [you] know] this [is] [how] _he_ stands such [and] such [a] day [the] way _they_ break [it] out 
B|79| M: [yes [.] [the] polls are] [what we] call [a] joke . 
A|80| B: [it's] [just] [it's] [just] ridiculous . 
B|81| M: [you] can't tell me [what] [to] _do ._ 
A|82| B: uh-huh [it] really could [and] [uh] then [how] sometimes [how] _the media_ will blow things out [of] proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] [good] [and] dead [and] _they_ keep dragging [it] on [and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an [election] [for [the] guy] [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [he] . 
A|84| B: [yeah] [so uh] 
B|85| M: [i think] [it's] funny [that] [they're] doing [it because] [they're] [the media] [not the] 
A|86| B: _they_ really [do [.] i] [i] sometimes [think] [that that] should be limited more . 
B|87| M: [the media] [is] pretty much [the] only thing [that] [can get] [him] [elected] . 
A|88| B: [oh] [yes] or _they_ [i] agree with [the] _freedom [of_ the] press [you know] [and] all [the] amendments [but] sometimes [it's] [for the] public's own [good] [that] [we] [don't] hear things . 
B|89| M: [well] [you] [have to] admit [that they] [have] [some] [freedom of] [information] . 
A|90| B: [no] [they] [don't] . 
B|91| M: [i] am [not] sure [if] [they] care . 
A|92| B: [well] [i] enjoyed [talking] [to] [you] . 
B|93| M: [you] [are] [a good] man . 
A|94| B: all [right .] 
B|95| M: [i] guess you're [right .]
