B|31| M: _i , [i_ ,] [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|32| B: [so] [i've always] had this problem _with_ consumer reports that [in] [the] areas that [i] know [a lot] about [, i] _disagree with_ [them .] 
B|33| M: [i've always] found [the] gun [magazines] [to] be [a lot] [more] comfortable [to] hold than [the] [magazines] themselves .
