A|0| B: _right ._ 
B|1| M: _i_ _know_ _that_ _the jury_ decides . 
A|2| B: _right ._ _there's_ there _this_ topic _is_ kind _of_ mute . _uh_ 
B|3| M: what _do_ _you_ _mean_ ? 
A|4| B: there _there's_ _no_ way . _we_ _we_ couldn't survive _in a_ _in a_ juror _in a_ trial _system_ without _a_ [jury] . 
B|5| M: [right .] 
A|6| B: _uh_ one man _can_ _never_ _be_ one man one woman _can_ _never_ _be_ objectionable _in_ every case . 
B|7| M: _they_ are . 
A|8| B: _uh_ every person has their opinions and _that's why_ [jury] selection _is_ often very difficult . _uh_ . 
B|9| M: [we] don't . 
A|10| B: [right .] 
B|11| M:  
A|12| B: [right .] [they] shouldn't allow an _appeal ._ 
B|13| M: _i'm_ a'there's . 
A|14| B: yep . 
B|15| M: _can't_ [be] legal . 
A|16| B: uh-huh 
B|17| M: what [is] ? 
A|18| B: oh _that's_ [right .] [i] work _for _a_ law_ firm 
B|19| M: [i] _was_ _at_ _the_ school . 
A|20| B: [right .] 
B|21| M: _the_ lawyers _have_ been involved [in a] lot . 
A|22| B: well _plea_ _plea_ bargaining [is] _a different_ story . 
B|23| M: because it's _the only_ option available _to_ _them_ . 
A|24| B: _plea_ bargaining [is] something completely _different_ . [that] [that] actually prevents trials . or [at] least speeds [them] up . 
B|25| M: if [they] get [a] [plea] bargain then [they] [can] [be] charged with assault . 
A|26| B: [right .] 
B|27| M: _i mean_ _the_ whole [system] [is] broken . [that's why] they're doing it . 
A|28| B: [right .] 
B|29| M: it's [a law] 
A|30| B: huh . 
B|31| M: [they] don't . 
A|32| B: [right .] 
B|33| M:  ... _but_ _we do_ _have_ capital penalty . 
A|34| B: [we do] 
B|35| M: [why] don't [we] _have_ capital punishments ? 
A|36| B: [right .] 
B|37| M: [i] _think_ they're both guilty 
A|38| B: [right .] when you're _saying_ as far as _the appeal_ _uh_ procedure [was] concerned . 
B|39| M: it's not [that] they're not guilty . it's [that] [they] aren't guilty . 
A|40| B: [we] just [have] [the] case [i'm] [i'm] _sure_ you've probably _heard of_ marion berry . 
B|41| M: [i'm] not [sure] i've [never] [heard _of] [the_ [appeal] .] 
A|42| B: _uh_ his last [appeal] [was] [was] denied two days before his sentence [was] up 
B|43| M: [uh] what ? 
A|44| B: _so_ [i mean] his [appeal] [was] denied and two days later _he_ got out [of] jail _for_ cocaine possession . 
B|45| M: [no] he's [a] minor . 
A|46| B: [but] [uh] [that] [was] absurd there [is] [never] there [was] [no] reason [the appeal] process should [have] dragged _on_ [that] long _for a_ six month sentence . 
B|47| M: [he] [was] [on] probation . 
A|48| B: well [uh] [the] [the only] [i] [can] [i] [you] [know] [the appeal] procedure [is] [the only] thing [i] [can] possibly [think] [of] . [uh] like [i] said as far as removing [of [the] jury] and having [the] judge sentence [that's] absurd . _there's_ [no] way [that] could work . 
B|49| M: [the appeal] 
A|50| B: [uh] [but] 
B|51| M: it's 
A|52| B: oh exactly . 
B|53| M: _i i_ don t [know] . 
A|54| B: exactly . [right .] 
B|55| M: it's not _about_ feeling good . it's _about_ feeling happy . 
A|56| B: [no] one _would want_ [the] job 
B|57| M: what if [i] told [you] [i] [would want] _to_ [do] [this] [for a] living . 
A|58| B: [uh] and [you] [know] like [i] said [the] [you] [know] everyone has their opinions [about] every case . 
B|59| M: [i] [know] . [the] majority [do] 
A|60| B: oh yeah . [i i] feel [that] everyone [is] everyone [is] [uh] entitled [to] [a] trial by [jury] . [that] [that] [that] [right] 
B|61| M: [i] am uhh [i'm] not . 
A|62| B: well [i mean] were there witnesses ? 
B|63| M: [i] don't [think] [so] . 
A|64| B: [right .] [right .] _that you_ [can't] [you] [can't] remove [the jury] regardless [of the] case . 
B|65| M: [i] [know] [i'm] [saying] [that you] [can] 
A|66| B: [i mean] [you] could [have] fifty _people_ [in] audience watching [a] murder take place 
B|67| M: [i] [was] thinking [of] [a different] scenario . 
A|68| B: and [you] you'd still _there's_ still mitigating circumstances 
B|69| M: [there's] [only] [so] many [people] [you] [can] watch [in] [jury] duty .
