B|11| M: [but] _no_ 
A|12| B: _the_ _thing_ [i don't] [like] _about_ [dogs] sometimes _is_ _that_ _the house_ will _just_ reek , _of_ _the_ [dogs _,] and_ constantly .

A|14| B: _yeah _,_ that's_ _true_ . 
B|15| M: _they_ .

B|19| M: [i'm] sorry _, i don't_ understand . 
A|20| B: _oh ,_ _really_ ? 
B|21| M: [that's] _the most_ important _thing ._ 
A|22| B: uh-huh . 
B|23| M: [i'm] ? 
A|24| B: _oh ,_ _that_ sounds _so_ easy , _what _i_ did_ , 
B|25| M: _no ,_ 
A|26| B: _yeah , i_ housesat from cats _for_ [a] friend _of_ mine which _she_ [was] finishing up her thesis , 
B|27| M: _i think_ [you] _mean_ _cat_ . 
A|28| B: [and] _what_ _we_ used _to do_ [was] _just_ put _, um ,_ newspaper on [the] bottom [and] then put [cat] litter [and] then [i] _would_ _just_ take [the] whole [thing] _to_ [the] garbage _can_ [and] dump [the] whole [thing .] 
B|29| M: [that's] _pretty_ cool , i'd love [to do] _that ._ 
A|30| B: then [i] _would_ [do] _it_ _, you _know_ ,_ everyday or two days _so_ [i] _would_ clean [that] pan _very_ , _very_ rarely , 
B|31| M: [i'm] [not] sure _how_ _many_ _times_ i've done _this_ , _but i_ _have a_ good _amount of time_ _in [the_ house] 
A|32| B: [and] _so_ _it_ wasn't _so_ bad . 
B|33| M: [the] last _time_ [i did] _that _,_ it was_ _for the_ second _time_ 
A|34| B: two cats [and] _just_ _as_ easy [it] _just_ _never_ started smelling [, i] _would_ put _just_ [a] little _bit_ [of] [cat] litter [in] _there_ , because if [i] put _a lot_ , one [of] [the] cats _would_ [have] _been_ , 
B|35| M: _how_ _many_ _times_ [have] [you] _tried_ _this_ ? 
A|36| B: all [of] her animals [that] _she_ ever had were adopted . 
B|37| M: _how_ _do [you_ know] ? 
A|38| B: [i] [that] _true_ _, yeah_ . _yeah ,_ she's even got , she's got one [dog] now [and] [the] two cats [and] her [dog] _there_ _is_ , _is_ basically [a] reject , somebody had bought him _, and_ wanted him . 
B|39| M: [oh] [yeah] ! _i remember that_ ! 
A|40| B: [it was] her ex boyfriend [and] _, you _know_ ,_ _just_ [was] [not] mature enough _to keep_ [the] [dog] , _didn't_ realize [how] much work [it was] [and] now , she's stuck with _it ._ 
B|41| M: [what] _happened_ ? 
A|42| B: [and] she's _just_ _so_ kindhearted [that] _she_ _just_ takes all [the] animals [but [i] think] [that] [for] me , _well ,_ _my_ husband _just_ has completely nixed [the] _idea_ [of] having [a dog] or [a cat] because [that's] all _there_ _is_ [to] _it ._ _so _, you_ _know_ ,_ 
B|43| M: [i] 
A|44| B: [no _,] we_ _don't have_ _anything_ _right_ now . 
B|45| M: [so , you] don'have [anything] [to] 
A|46| B: _oh _,_ right_ , now _we have a_ kid [but] _he_ [was] _, [no_ ,] completely against having [a dog] or [cat] _, he_ said [, they're] much [, they're] _as_ much work _as a_ kid _, and_ [they're] harder [to] _get_ rid [of] [for the] weekend _, and_ , 
B|47| M: [what] [, you know] 
A|48| B: uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [you] [can] . 
A|50| B: [that's] [, uh _,] yeah ,_ _really_ _true_ . [but] [like] [the] friends , other friends [of] mine [have] cats _, they_ [have] four [of] _them_ _, and_ if [they] go away _, they_ [have] _, they_ hire [a] pet sitter [to] come [in] twice [a] day [and] pet _them_ [and] things [like] [that] [and] _their_ cats [, you _know] [,_ they're] [so] used [to] [the] attention , [that] if _they don't_ _get_ [it] _, they_ _get_ _really_ upset , 
B|51| M:  [, they] ,? 
A|52| B: [and] [, you _know] [,_ they] sort [of] cause trouble around [the house] [and] things [like] [that [.] _i] , i_ [tried] [to] [have] _, um ,_ figured something having , [so] [i] [tried] [to] [have a] goldfish , 
B|53| M: [you] . 
A|54| B: [and] _, um [,_ i] killed [that] one within _a very_ short [amount of _time] ._ 
B|55| M: ' [about] . 
A|56| B: _right_ . 
B|57| M: [i _, i] , i_ . 
A|58| B: _my_ brother had _fish_ when [i was] [a] kid [i remember [that] _,] and_ one [of] his _fish_ jumped _out of_ [the] _, um ,_ gosh , [what] [do you] call [it] , _fish_ tank . [and] fried itself , on [the] radiator behind [the] dresser . i'll _never_ forget [that] because [i remember] _my_ brother _, he_ came home [and] _he_ counted [the] _fish_ 
B|59| M: [i'm] 
A|60| B: [and] one [of] [the] _fish_ [was] missing [and] [they] couldn't find [it] anyplace [, they] couldn't figure _out_ [what] had [happened] [and] then [they] found [it] fried on , [the] radiator behind . 
B|61| M: [fish] 
A|62| B: [it was] [not] gross _, i didn't_ see [it] [but] _, um ,_ got _them ._ 
B|63| M: _how did_ [he] [get] [out _of] that_ [fish] ? 
A|64| B: trying [to] [remember] _we_ had [a dog] [for] [a] while _, and [i_ don't] [know] if _we_ got rid [of] [the] [dog] because _my_ brother [was] allergic [to] [it] , _my_ brother had asthma [and] some allergies which [i think] _he's_ outgrown now , 
B|65| M: why [would] [you] [do] [that] ? 
A|66| B: [but] because [of that] _we_ _didn't have_ _very_ [many] pets afterwards [and] then [he] had _fish ._ 
B|67| M: [that] _is so_ _weird_ . 
A|68| B: [and] [you] [, they're] [, like] [you] say [, they're] [not] [the most] exciting pet [to] [have] . 
B|69| M: [i think] [they] _are_ [the most] _fun_ [, they're] [just] [not] [as] _fun_ [as [a] dog] . 
A|70| B: _well ,_ [a] friend [of] mine had _, um ,_ an eel , 
B|71| M: _it's_ [a] _fish ,_ _not a_ 
A|72| B: [and] then [he] had [a] _, um [,_ i] forget [what] type [of] [fish] [it was] [, it was] one [of] these _fish that_ [it] [would] eat [, it] ate [a] big other [fish] [and] things [like] [that .] _there_ [would] be sort [of] moby [fish] [in] [a] tank . 
B|73| M: [i'm] 
A|74| B: _yeah _,_ and_ [it] [, i , i] couldn't see having [fish] [like] [that .] 
B|75| M: [you] _mean [,_ he] [, [i] was] _sick [, and_ [i] [, i] [didn't] have] any [fish .] 
A|76| B: [i] _could_ see some having , maybe some [of] [the] tropical [fish ,] _that are_ _really_ , _really_ [pretty] [but] , 
B|77| M: _i mean [,_ _they] do_ [have [a] lot] [of] food [in] [them .] 
A|78| B: uh-huh . 
B|79| M: yup [, [we] have a] few [fish [that] are] [, uh ,] [pretty] rare . 
A|80| B: [yeah] . 
B|81| M: [what] ?! [i'm] [not] getting [it .] 
A|82| B: _yeah _,_ [no_ ,] [that] [would] be , [what] [did] [they do] , everyone come around [and] watch [them .] 
B|83| M: [i like] [it .] 
A|84| B: _i mean _, i_ guess_ [that's] fine if [you have a] _mouse_ _problem_ at your frat [house] [, and] your things destroyed [the] mice . 
B|85| M: [not] [really] [. [i] mean , i] [have a] laptop [and] _mouse ,_ [but _i] can't_ use [the] [mouse] anymore . 
A|86| B: [but] , 
B|87| M: _it's not_ [really] [a] [problem] _, i [don't_ have] any problems . 
A|88| B: let's see [, i] had [a] pet rat , [for] [a] while [, and] [it was] [a] _live_ rat [, and] _, um ,_ [this] woman [just] offered [it] [to] me while [i was] [in] , [in] graduate school [and] , _she_ [was] actually _a very_ [fun] pet . 
B|89| M: [oh [,] that's] [a] good [idea] . 
A|90| B: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [yeah ,] [he's] [a very] nice guy . 
A|92| B: [yeah ,] mine had _been a_ , [a] , [a] [how did] [this] work , [a] mill rat had _been_ bought [and] [the] [people] [in the] lab one day called [in] _my_ friend [and] said [, you _know] ,_ [this] rat [is] acting [really] strange [i think] [he's] [sick , and] _she_ said [, i don't] [think] [he's] [sick [,] [i] think] she's pregnant , 
B|93| M: [you] 
A|94| B: [and] [they] had misclassed [the] sex [of] _back_ _there_ [and] [so _,] um ,_ _she_ asked me if [i] want [to] , one [of] those babies [, and i] took [the] baby [and i] got her when _she_ [was] [, you _know] ,_ [just] [this] tiniest little [thing] [like] , half [the] price [of] [a] [mouse ,] 
B|95| M: yes 
A|96| B: [and] then _she_ grew [to] be [, you _know] [,_ i] had pictures [of] her when _she_ [would] sit on _my_ hand [and] then _she_ grew [to] be [pretty] big [, you _know] [,_ like] [a] pound or something 
B|97| M: [i] 
A|98| B: [i don't] [know] [how] much [, and i] had her [for] over two years [and] _she_ [was] [very] affectionate . _she_ [would] [, you _know] ,_ crawl on me [and] _she_ [would] sit [like] on _my_ neck or _my_ shoulder while [i was] working [, and] things [like] [that .] [yeah ,] much more than [you] [would] [think] . 
B|99| M: [she] 
A|100| B: [yeah] [and] , 
B|101| M: [and] ... 
A|102| B: _yeah [, i_ ,] sort [of] [weird] [for] me [to] [have] had one too [but] _there_ [, it was] [a] convenient little pet [to] [have] because [it] stayed [in] its cage [and] [, you _know] [,_ it was] easy . easy [to] take care [of] 
B|103| M: [my] 
A|104| B: [and] [but] , 
B|105| M: [he's] [a cat] . 
A|106| B: uh-huh . 
B|107| M: [i] [know [,] i'm] [just] saying _it's not_ [true] 
A|108| B: actually [it was] more [fun] than [you] [would] [think] . [yeah ,] starting from [the] beginning [but] _, um _,_ yeah [,_ we] _live_ , also _live in the city_ now , actually _in manhattan_ . 
B|109| M: [that] [was] [fun] [, you know] . 
A|110| B: [and] [so] [it's] almost _impossible_ [to] _, [it's_ not] fair [to] [a] pet [to] [have a] pet here , or certainly , certainly [not [a] dog] , 
B|111| M: i've [never] met [a dog] [that] [could] [do] [that .] 
A|112| B: [i mean ,] [people] [do] , 
B|113| M: [they don't] [, they] [live [in] manhattan] 
A|114| B: [but] [it's not] , 
B|115| M: [i'm] [not] saying [it's] [impossible] [, i'm] [just] saying [it] [is] .

A|122| B: [they] [have] _, um ,_ [the] _bags_ behind [them] [but [i] think] [they're] actually supposed [to] , _keep_ [them] [, yeah ,] _keep_ [them] clean 
B|123| M: _are they_ [not] allowed [to keep] [their] [bags] [in the] [back] ? 
A|124| B: [but] , [oh ,] gosh [, [i] can't] even walk by central park [yeah] when summertime , [just] [the] smell [is so] bad [of] [the] horses .
