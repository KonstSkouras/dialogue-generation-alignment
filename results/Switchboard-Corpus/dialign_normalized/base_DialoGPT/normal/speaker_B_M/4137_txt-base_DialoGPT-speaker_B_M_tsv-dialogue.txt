A|24| B: [a] lexus _uh_ s c three hundred maybe . something _on_ [that] order . 
B|25| M: [a] honda [uh] _mercedes_ ? 
A|26| B: [you] [know] because your _b_ m _w_ your german cars _have_ good reputations [i think] .

B|29| M: [i] was [the] one who bought [the] car . 
A|30| B: [the] [yeah] [they] their [they] _have_ [the] whole philosophy [i] mean [they] [they] kind [of] even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which [is] kind [of] hard _to take_ 
B|31| M: _it's_ [of] 
A|32| B: [i] mean _as_ you're walking through [that] little tour in [uh] munich [it's] kind [of] they're trying [to] brainwash [you] too 
B|33| M: [well] [i] was [the] one who told them [i] was 
A|34| B: [oh really ?] 
B|35| M: we were 
A|36| B: um . 
B|37| M: _that's_ _not_ . 
A|38| B: [yeah] [that's] 
B|39| M: [it's] [the] same [as] [the] [b] amp [w] [right] ? 
A|40| B: no _it's not_ _realistic_ . 
B|41| M: [so] [is] [it] [realistic] [to] [have] porsche porsche [racing] [on] [a] [racing] simulator ? 
A|42| B: [yeah] if [you] can afford [that] kind [of] [a] toy then [i] guess [uh] 
B|43| M: [it's] [a] car [not] [a] car . 
A|44| B: [yeah] just work short trips . no no heavy mileage . [i'm] putting [on] less than fifteen thousand miles [a] year . 
B|45| M: do [you] [think] [it's] worth [it] ? 
A|46| B: [so] [it's] pretty minimal . 
B|47| M: [well] _i'm not_ [a] car guy [but] [i'm] willing [to take] [a] small loan .

B|53| M: [but] [i] [have [a] mercedes] . 
A|54| B: [uh i think] [well] something [on] [the] order [of] [a] three series [it's] probably different . once [you] get up in [the] five series [and] higher then all your repair costs go up significantly 
B|55| M: [you] [it's not] [like] [the] factory [is] expensive . 
A|56| B: [so] [i'm] kind [yeah] [i'm not] sure if [i] [really] [want]
