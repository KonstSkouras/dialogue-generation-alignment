B|23| M: i'll [buy] [it] . 
A|24| B: [a] lexus _, uh ,_ s c three hundred maybe . something _on_ [that] order . 
B|25| M: [a] honda [, uh ,] _mercedes_ ? 
A|26| B: [you] [know] , because your _b_ m _w_ your german cars _have_ good reputations _, i think_ . 
B|27| M: [yeah [,] [uh ,] i think] you've got [it] . 
A|28| B: yes . 
B|29| M: [i] was [the] one who bought [the] car . 
A|30| B: [the] , [yeah ,] [they] , their , [they] _have_ [the] whole philosophy [, i] mean , [they] , [they] kind [of] even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better , which [is] kind [of] hard _to take_ 
B|31| M: _it's_ , [of] , 
A|32| B: [i] mean _as_ you're walking through [that] little tour in [, uh ,] munich _, it's_ kind [of] they're trying [to] brainwash _you ,_ too 
B|33| M: [well] [i] was [the] one who told them [i] was 
A|34| B: [oh , really ?] 
B|35| M: we were 
A|36| B: um . 
B|37| M: _that's_ _not_ . 
A|38| B: [yeah] [that's] , 
B|39| M: [it's] [the] same [as] [the] [b] amp [w] , [right] ? 
A|40| B: no _, it's not_ _realistic_ . 
B|41| M: [so] [is] [it] [realistic] [to] [have] porsche porsche [racing] [on] [a] [racing] simulator ? 
A|42| B: [yeah ,] if [you] can afford [that] kind [of] [a] toy , then [, i] guess [, uh] 
B|43| M: [it's] [a] car , [not] [a] car . 
A|44| B: [yeah ,] just work , short trips . no no heavy mileage . [i'm] putting [on] less than fifteen thousand miles [a] year . 
B|45| M: do [you] [think] [it's] worth [it] ? 
A|46| B: [so] [it's] pretty minimal . 
B|47| M: [well _,] i'm not_ [a] car guy [, but] [i'm] willing [to take] [a] small loan . 
A|48| B: lasts [a] long time . [that's] mainly [what] [i'm] looking for . 
B|49| M: [what] do [you want] ? 
A|50| B: [oh ,] [yeah] . 
B|51| M: [it's] [the] same [as] [the] _mercedes_ . 
A|52| B: [but] [, but] if , if [you] _have a_ problem with _a mercedes_ , [you] [take] [it] into [a] shop , they're going [to] , they're going [to] hit [you] up for just all kinds [of] things 
B|53| M: [but] [i] [have [a] mercedes] . 
A|54| B: [uh , i think] , [well ,] something [on] [the] order [of] [a] three series _, it's_ probably different . once [you] get up in [the] five series [and] higher , then , all your repair costs go up significantly 
B|55| M: [you [,] it's not] [like] [the] factory [is] expensive . 
A|56| B: [so] [i'm] kind , [yeah [,] i'm not] sure if [i] [really] [want] ,
