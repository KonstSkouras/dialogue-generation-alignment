B|20| M: [it's fun] 
A|21| B: _we_ [just] _had a_ bunch _of people_ _over_ [and] _we_ _had_ , _we_ _did_ [lasagna] [and] garlic bread [and] , _uh_ , yummy .

A|25| B: _oh . oh_ , _good ._ 
B|26| M: [yes [,] i] am . 
A|27| B: _uh_ , actually one _thing_ _we_ [have] done quite _a bit_ through [the] holidays , [just] _because_ [it's a] , real _easy_ , _is_ [just] baked potato dinners . 
B|28| M: [it's] [just] [that] _i'm_ [really] tired [and it's] [really] hard _to_ sleep . 
A|29| B: [and] [have] _, you_ _know ,_ _like_ three or four couples come _over_ [, and] [i'll] [do] [the] potatoes [and] [you] _know ,_ _like_ butter [and] cheese _and stuff_ [and] [have] everybody else [just] bring [a] couple [of] toppings , whatever they _like_ 
B|30| M: [yeah [,] [it's] like _,] a lot_ [of] [things] [, i] _just _have_ to_ _be_ creative [and [stuff] .] 
A|31| B: _and it_ turns out great , _because_ _i mean_ , you've got [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue [and] _, you_ _know ,_ bacon [and] all [that] _good_ [stuff .] 
B|32| M: [we] 
A|33| B: [but it's] [, it's] inexpensive 
B|34| M: [i] think [it's a] [fun] [thing] . 
A|35| B: plus [it's] real _easy_ [on] [the] hostess , _because [you_ can] [just have] [the] potatoes ready [, and] [just [have] a] salad [with] [it [,] and] [you] got [a] great dinner . 
B|36| M: _i've_ been using [it] as [a] cheat day _. it's_ [really] [good .] 
A|37| B: [it's] [, it's] real _easy_ [, _i] like_ _doing_ [that] part . 
B|38| M: _if you_ don't mind , [can] [you] explain [how] [it's] [easy] ? 
A|39| B: [i'm] _in_ favor [of] very _little_ clean _up_ , um , very _little_ planning _because_ we've got three or four couples [that] [we] _get_ together [with] [to] play games , 
B|40| M: [i] don't think [i can] handle [the] idea [of] _a lot_ [of people] having [the] _same_ idea [of] [what] _a lot_ [is] . 
A|41| B: [and it's] , 
B|42| M: [and it's] 
A|43| B: [we] invariably end _up_ at _my_ house since [i've] got two kids . 
B|44| M: ohh . [uh] . 
A|45| B: [and] [that [,] it's] [, it's] fine , _because_ _then [i_ can] [just] say _, okay_ fine _, you_ bring _this_ _, you_ bring _this_ _, you_ bring _this_ , _we're_ done . 
B|46| M: [we're] always here _, you're_ [just] _not_ . 
A|47| B: [and it's] pretty cool . 
B|48| M: _i guess_ . 
A|49| B: uh-huh _. _oh_ ._ 
B|50| M: [i] [know _,] [but_ it's] [good .] 
A|51| B: _oh ._ 
B|52| M: [you can] eat _the chicken_ _rice_ 
A|53| B: _oh_ [, [i] love it] 
B|54| M: [it is] ... 
A|55| B: um . 
B|56| M: [oh . oh] 
A|57| B: _over_ [the] uncooked [rice] ? 
B|58| M: _i'm not_ sure [how] [you can] _do that _,_ _but_ [i_ [do] _it] with_ [a] [rice] cooker . 
A|59| B: [oh .] 
B|60| M: [you can] _cook_ [it] [over] [rice] [, _you] [just_ _have] to_ _use_ [the] [right] broth 
A|61| B: [oh] , [how] neat . 
B|62| M: [it's] _an_ [oven [,] _and] _the_ rice_ [is] cooked _in it ._ 
A|63| B: huh . now [i've] done [it with] , where _you put_ [, you] [cook] [the] well [, [i] guess] [you] probably could [do it] [same] way [, but] [cook] [the rice] _and then_ take [a] [can] [of] [like] cream [of] mushroom _soup_ or cream [of] [chicken] _soup_ [, and] _put _a_ little_ _bit_ [of] white wine [in it .] 
B|64| M: [i'm] [a] vegetarian . 
A|65| B: [and] every once _in a_ while , [i'll] _put_ [in] , [i'll] slice white grapes [and] [i'll] _put_ _in there_ [, and] , that's [just] _because_ [i'm not] [a] real _big_ wine person [but _i] like_ [it ,] [it] adds _something_ [to] [the chicken] . 
B|66| M: _yeah ._ 
A|67| B: _and then_ [just] bake [it [,] _and] it_ makes [a] wonderful sauce [over] [the _rice] ._ 
B|68| M: [i [like] ,] i'ma . 
A|69| B: [yeah] 
B|70| M: [and it's] [good] [for] [you] ? 
A|71| B: [it's] , [that] was one _of the_ first [things] [i] _made_ [for] _my_ husband , _because_ [i] was [like ,] um , [yeah] 
B|72| M: [i] [just] [made] some [rice] noodles [and it] looks [like] [rice] noodles . 
A|73| B: [i] could actually _find something_ [i] could [cook] real [easy] _that would_ [be] kind [of] sort [of] elegant kind [of] 
B|74| M: [i'm not] sure [, [but] [i] can] [find something] [that would] look [good .] 
A|75| B: [oh] , [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [because [you] can't] [cook] [it] [in a] cooking utensil . 
A|77| B: [but] _then_ [, i] hadn't thought [about] _doing_ [it with] uncooked _rice ._ 
B|78| M: [it's] [not] as messy as [you] think [it is] . 
A|79| B: so , [just] , [like] [in a] thirteen by nine _pan_ . 
B|80| M: [not] exactly . [i've] never cooked [it .] 
A|81| B: um . 
B|82| M: [i mean] ... [you put] [it] [in the] [pan] , [right] ? 
A|83| B: um . 
B|84| M: [you] wanna see 
A|85| B: uh-huh . 
B|86| M: [what] [is] ? 
A|87| B: [yeah ,] [yeah [,] i] [, i] [use] [that] [for] [for] [rice] [and] [for] when [i] [cook] pasta or [something] , [i'll] _put _a_ little_ _bit_ [of] bouillon _in there_ [just] [to] give [it] _a little_ extra flavor . 
B|88| M: [i've] been [doing] [this] [with] [my] [rice _.] i_ [put a] cup [of] broth [in there] [and [then] i] add [a little] water . 
A|89| B: um . now [that would] [be] [good .] 
B|90| M: uhhh . [uh] . [yeah .] 
A|91| B: _how long_ [do] [you] [have to] bake [it] ? 
B|92| M: ohhhh [, okay] , [i'm] [a] [big] fan [of the] egg . 
A|93| B: [i do] [, [i] do] microwave too [, a lot] 
B|94| M: [i] _want to_ eat [it .] 
A|95| B: _how long_ [would] [it] [be] _how long_ [would] [it] [be] [in the] microwave ? 
B|96| M: [it's] _an_ egg . [i'm not] sure . 
A|97| B: [oh] [, okay] . [okay] . [do] [you just] _brown_ [the chicken] [to] _get_ [it] colored 
B|98| M: [i] used [a lot] [of] [brown] [rice] [, [but] i] [did] [use] [brown] [rice .] 
A|99| B: or [do] [you] go ahead [and] let [it] [cook] through ? 
B|100| M: [you _can] get_ [the chicken] straight [up] [in the oven] . [i'm not] sure [how long] [you can] [cook] [it] though . 
A|101| B: um . ooh , [this] [is] [a] beneficial [call] [. [i] like] [this] 
B|102| M: [i'm] gonna try [to] eat [it] 
A|103| B: [yeah [,] but] [that] one's [an] [easy] one [. [it's] like ,] [just] [put] [in] [, a] friend [of] mine makes [it] where she goes ahead [and] seasons [up] [the] , [with] [the] _soup_ [and the] wine 
B|104| M: [i like] [the] idea [, [but] [it's] [a] bit] messy [and] messy . 
A|105| B: [put] [in] garlic [and] onion powder or chopped onions [if you] [want to] [do that [,] you] [know .] [what] ever , however much effort [you] feel [like] putting into [it .] 
B|106| M: [what] [is] [this] [soup] ? 
A|107| B: [but] [it ,] [it] makes [a] great [, [i] mean] , [i've] got [a] two year old [and] [a] four year old [and] they [love [it] .] 
B|108| M: [i] dunno . [i've] always [had a] _good ,_ [i'm] 
A|109| B: [and] , [because] [my] daughter calls [it] her gravy [and [i] mean] , she thinks [it's] wonderful , [my] , [good [,] you're] [a] picky eater , [if] [i [can] get] [you] [to] ,
