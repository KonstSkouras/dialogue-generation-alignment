A|3| B: that's that's _what_ _i like_ _doing_ _things_ _like_ making _lasagna_ _just_ _because_ _i can_ [have] [it] ready _and_ baking _in the oven_ 
B|4| M: _that_ _and i_ _have _a_ lot_ _of_ trouble _with_ being _a_ _cook_ . 
A|5| B: _it's_ 
B|6| M: [i] don't _know ._ _but it's_

A|9| B: [i] . 
B|10| M: uhhhhh . 
A|11| B: that's one [of] those _things i_ got famous _for_ _in_ college . _people_ _would_ come [and] say could _would_ [you] come _over_ [and] _make_ _lasagna_ _for_ me 
B|12| M: _it's a_ small town . 
A|13| B: _it's like_ well [i] _can't_ _really_ give [you] [a] recipe _uh_ 
B|14| M: [i] think _i'll_ [just] [make] lasagne [and] _call_ [it] [lasagna] . 
A|15| B: _i can_ _i can_ _just _do_ it_ 
B|16| M: [i] don't _know ._ 
A|17| B: _i like_ _doing_ [that] kind [of _stuff] ._ 
B|18| M: [you can't] [just _do] that_ . 
A|19| B: _and it's_ _it's fun_ _in_ fact that's _what_ _we_ _had_ _for_ [a] christmas party last week . 
B|20| M: [it's fun] 
A|21| B: _we_ [just] _had a_ bunch _of people_ _over_ [and] _we_ _had_ _we_ _did_ [lasagna] [and] garlic bread [and] _uh_ yummy . 
B|22| M: [i] don't _know_ [what] _you're_ talking _about_ . 
A|23| B: _uh_ _i do_ too _in_ fact 
B|24| M: [i do] . 
A|25| B: _oh . oh_ _good ._ 
B|26| M: [yes] [i] am . 
A|27| B: _uh_ actually one _thing_ _we_ [have] done quite _a bit_ through [the] holidays [just] _because_ [it's a] real _easy_ _is_ [just] baked potato dinners . 
B|28| M: [it's] [just] [that] _i'm_ [really] tired [and it's] [really] hard _to_ sleep . 
A|29| B: [and] [have] [you] [know] _like_ three or four couples come _over_ [and] [i'll] [do] [the] potatoes [and] [you] [know] _like_ butter [and] cheese _and stuff_ [and] [have] everybody else [just] bring [a] couple [of] toppings whatever they _like_ 
B|30| M: [yeah] [it's like] _a lot_ [of] [things i] _just _have_ to_ _be_ creative [and [stuff] .] 
A|31| B: _and it_ turns out great _because_ _i mean_ you've got [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue [and] [you] [know] bacon [and] all [that] _good_ [stuff .] 
B|32| M: [we] 
A|33| B: [but it's] [it's] inexpensive 
B|34| M: [i] think [it's a] [fun] [thing] . 
A|35| B: plus [it's] real _easy_ [on] [the] hostess _because [you_ can] [just have] [the] potatoes ready [and] [just [have] a] salad [with] [it] [and] [you] got [a] great dinner . 
B|36| M: _i've_ been using [it] as [a] cheat day _. it's_ [really] [good .] 
A|37| B: [it's] [it's] real _easy_ _i like_ _doing_ [that] part . 
B|38| M: _if you_ don't mind [can] [you] explain [how] [it's] [easy] ? 
A|39| B: [i'm] _in_ favor [of] very _little_ clean _up_ um very _little_ planning _because_ we've got three or four couples [that] [we] _get_ together [with] [to] play games 
B|40| M: [i] don't think [i can] handle [the] idea [of] _a lot_ [of people] having [the] _same_ idea [of] [what] _a lot_ [is] . 
A|41| B: [and it's] 
B|42| M: [and it's] 
A|43| B: [we] invariably end _up_ at _my_ house since [i've] got two kids . 
B|44| M: ohh . [uh] . 
A|45| B: [and] [that] [it's] [it's] fine _because_ _then [i_ can] [just] say _okay_ fine [you] bring _this_ [you] bring _this_ [you] bring _this_ _we're_ done . 
B|46| M: [we're] always here _you're_ [just] _not_ . 
A|47| B: [and it's] pretty cool . 
B|48| M: _i guess_ . 
A|49| B: uh-huh _. _oh_ ._ 
B|50| M: [i] [know] [but it's] [good .] 
A|51| B: _oh ._ 
B|52| M: [you can] eat _the chicken_ _rice_ 
A|53| B: _oh_ [i love it] 
B|54| M: [it is] ... 
A|55| B: um . 
B|56| M: [oh . oh] 
A|57| B: _over_ [the] uncooked [rice] ? 
B|58| M: _i'm not_ sure [how] [you can] _do that_ _but [i_ [do] _it] with_ [a] [rice] cooker . 
A|59| B: [oh .] 
B|60| M: [you can] _cook_ [it] [over] [rice] _you [just_ _have] to_ _use_ [the] [right] broth 
A|61| B: [oh] [how] neat . 
B|62| M: [it's] _an_ [oven] _and _the_ rice_ [is] cooked _in it ._ 
A|63| B: huh . now [i've] done [it with] where _you put_ [you] [cook] [the] well [i guess] [you] probably could [do it] [same] way [but] [cook] [the rice] _and then_ take [a] [can] [of] [like] cream [of] mushroom _soup_ or cream [of] [chicken] _soup_ [and] _put _a_ little_ _bit_ [of] white wine [in it .] 
B|64| M: [i'm] [a] vegetarian . 
A|65| B: [and] every once _in a_ while [i'll] _put_ [in] [i'll] slice white grapes [and] [i'll] _put_ _in there and_ that's [just] _because_ [i'm not] [a] real _big_ wine person [but _i] like_ [it] [it] adds _something_ [to] [the chicken] . 
B|66| M: _yeah ._ 
A|67| B: _and then_ [just] bake [it] _and it_ makes [a] wonderful sauce [over] [the _rice] ._ 
B|68| M: [i like] i'ma . 
A|69| B: [yeah] 
B|70| M: [and it's] [good] [for] [you] ? 
A|71| B: [it's] [that] was one _of the_ first [things i] _made_ [for] _my_ husband _because_ [i] was [like] um [yeah] 
B|72| M: [i] [just] [made] some [rice] noodles [and it] looks [like] [rice] noodles . 
A|73| B: [i] could actually _find something_ [i] could [cook] real [easy] _that would_ [be] kind [of] sort [of] elegant kind [of] 
B|74| M: [i'm not] sure [but [i] can] [find something] [that would] look [good .] 
A|75| B: [oh] [yeah .] 
B|76| M: [because [you] can't] [cook] [it] [in a] cooking utensil . 
A|77| B: [but] _then i_ hadn't thought [about] _doing_ [it with] uncooked _rice ._ 
B|78| M: [it's] [not] as messy as [you] think [it is] . 
A|79| B: so [just] [like] [in a] thirteen by nine _pan_ . 
B|80| M: [not] exactly . [i've] never cooked [it .] 
A|81| B: um . 
B|82| M: [i mean] ... [you put] [it] [in the] [pan] [right] ? 
A|83| B: um . 
B|84| M: [you] wanna see 
A|85| B: uh-huh . 
B|86| M: [what] [is] ? 
A|87| B: [yeah] [yeah] [i] [i] [use] [that] [for] [for] [rice] [and] [for] when [i] [cook] pasta or [something] [i'll] _put _a_ little_ _bit_ [of] bouillon _in there_ [just] [to] give [it] _a little_ extra flavor . 
B|88| M: [i've] been [doing] [this] [with] [my] [rice _.] i_ [put a] cup [of] broth [in there [and] [then] i] add [a little] water . 
A|89| B: um . now [that would] [be] [good .] 
B|90| M: uhhh . [uh] . [yeah .] 
A|91| B: _how long_ [do] [you] [have to] bake [it] ? 
B|92| M: ohhhh [okay] [i'm] [a] [big] fan [of the] egg . 
A|93| B: [i do] [i do] microwave too [a lot] 
B|94| M: [i] _want to_ eat [it .] 
A|95| B: _how long_ [would] [it] [be] _how long_ [would] [it] [be] [in the] microwave ? 
B|96| M: [it's] _an_ egg . [i'm not] sure . 
A|97| B: [oh] [okay] . [okay] . [do] [you just] _brown_ [the chicken] [to] _get_ [it] colored 
B|98| M: [i] used [a lot] [of] [brown] [rice] [but i] [did] [use] [brown] [rice .] 
A|99| B: or [do] [you] go ahead [and] let [it] [cook] through ? 
B|100| M: [you _can] get_ [the chicken] straight [up] [in the oven] . [i'm not] sure [how long] [you can] [cook] [it] though . 
A|101| B: um . ooh [this] [is] [a] beneficial [call] [. [i] like] [this] 
B|102| M: [i'm] gonna try [to] eat [it] 
A|103| B: [yeah] [but] [that] one's [an] [easy] one [. [it's] like] [just] [put] [in a] friend [of] mine makes [it] where she goes ahead [and] seasons [up] [the] [with] [the] _soup_ [and the] wine 
B|104| M: [i like] [the] idea [but [it's] [a] bit] messy [and] messy . 
A|105| B: [put] [in] garlic [and] onion powder or chopped onions [if you] [want to] [do that] [you] [know .] [what] ever however much effort [you] feel [like] putting into [it .] 
B|106| M: [what] [is] [this] [soup] ? 
A|107| B: [but] [it] [it] makes [a] great [i mean] [i've] got [a] two year old [and] [a] four year old [and] they [love [it] .] 
B|108| M: [i] dunno . [i've] always [had a] [good] [i'm] 
A|109| B: [and] [because] [my] daughter calls [it] her gravy [and [i] mean] she thinks [it's] wonderful [my] [good] [you're] [a] picky eater [if] [i [can] get] [you] [to]
