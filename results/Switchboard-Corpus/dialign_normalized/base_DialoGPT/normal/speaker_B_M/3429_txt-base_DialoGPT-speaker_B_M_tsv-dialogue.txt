B|39| M: [no] you're [just] 
A|40| B: [and] [it] always will be [and] [and] [i think] too noticing [the] [kids] _that_ [the] fourth [and] fifth graders which is [what] [my] son is [and] _stuff_ _they_ [they're] [just] [they're] more [they're] very open . 
B|41| M: [i'm] [so] sorry . 
A|42| B: [i mean] [the] boys _are_ very open because [that's] _that's all_ [i] [have] is boys [so] _that's all_ [i'm] around basically is boys 
B|43| M: [i know] 
A|44| B: but _they_ talk [about] things _that_ [i] [my] brother didn't talk [about] until he [was] [in] college _you know_

A|46| B: [and] [and] _they_ sit down [and] _they_ look at [you] [right] [in the] face [and] _they_ expect [a] truthful _answer_ . 
B|47| M: [you know] [you] [just] [say] uh [it's] cool [i'm not] [like] [that [you] know] ? 
A|48| B: [you can't] _get_ them give them [the] [oh] [you know] _cabbage patch_ _answers_ [and] [stuff] .

A|52| B: [and] _they_ [can] [tell me] basically some things [that] [i] [don't] [know] 
B|53| M: [that's] why [they] [have] [the] [cabbage patch] [and you] [can] _see_ [the] cabbages . 
A|54| B: but [it] [it's] interesting listening [to] them . [i think] [i think] [the] social changes [in] them [i think] [i] [see] [it] more with [that] generation than [i] [do] with [like] our generation . 
B|55| M: [what] ? [i'm] [just] kidding .
