A|9| B: i'd , i'd have [to] say _i_ haven't either . 
B|10| M: _not_ . 
A|11| B: _i_ listen [to] _the radio_ _, uh ,_ probably five or six hours a week , but almost inevitably [to] a station that is a classical _, uh ,_ station here , for _music_ purposes . 
B|12| M: helicop . yes .. 
A|13| B: _we_ don't use _the radio_ as a wake up , _we_ have our , a television connected [to] a _, uh _,_ uh ,_ electronic alarm _, uh ,_ system that kicks in , 
B|14| M:  
A|15| B: [and] _it_ comes on with _c n n_ in _the_ morning . 
B|16| M: _and the_ [music] 
A|17| B: that _we_ , _we_ wake up [to] television [news] [and _,] uh _,_ uh ,_ shower [and] dress , [and] whatever [to] that , [and] _then_ because [of] [the] fact that my wife [and] _i_ ride [to] work together _, uh ,_ in a car , _we_ , _we_ chat at each other rather than , than something else . 
B|18| M: _so_ ... 
A|19| B: _uh ,_ [and] occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have [the] newspaper sort [of] on our lap on [the] way in , in [the] car , [so] _we_ have [the] advantage [of] being able [to] _, uh ,_ read [and] drive although there seems [to] _be_ , from what i've seen on [the] freeway recently that a fair number [of] people are reading [and] driving 
B|20| M:  
A|21| B: [so] , _we_ , _we_ rely pretty , pretty heavily , _i think_ , on a combination [of] [the] , [of] [the] two . _i_ also _, uh ,_ use _, uh ,_ newsweek magazine . _uh ,_ 
B|22| M: [i] 
A|23| B: _we_ tend [to] alternate between newsweek [and] time [and] whatever happens [to] _be_ [the] , [the] _, uh [,_ news] magazine [of] [the] year for us . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| B: [and _,] uh ,_ [i] read sporadically [of] commentary [and] a couple [of] other , [you] know , trade magazines , [and _,] uh _,_ uh ,_ such as that _, uh ,_ where [i] might read [the] , [the] occasional social [and] even current event commentaries , [and ,] [and] everything as diverse as a _c_ m [to] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ some [of] [the] _, uh ,_ some [of] [the] other tabloids [i] get .

B|26| M:  
A|27| B: i've always said that _it_ , [it's] _really_ [not] interesting unless [it's] three weeks old [and] found its way into a [news] weekly headline . 
B|28| M:  _. and_ ,. 
A|29| B: _uh ,_ other than that _it_ was a at best . 
B|30| M: [then] . 
A|31| B: _uh ,_ we're probably [not] thrilled with our only newspaper that _we_ have in raleigh . there , there are other _, uh _,_ uh _,_ _i'm_ not_ sure what [you] would call [them] , they [the] small _, uh ,_ competing independent sort [of] newspapers . little small weekly things , but there's only one daily _, uh ,_ called [the] [news] [and] observer , fondly referred [to] here by some as [the] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ sometimes [the] noise [and] observer . 
B|32| M:  ... 
A|33| B: _uh ,_ _it_ depends . _it_ , _it's ,_ has decent national coverage , but has an extremely focused _political_ coverage , probably steeped in , [the] southern history [and the] fact that this is a democratic state .

B|40| M: [i ,] 
A|41| B: right . [so] , _i think_ _we_ find out what's happening in [the] city [, uh ,] on a fairly frequent basis , over a , over a gin [and] tonic sort [of] thing .
