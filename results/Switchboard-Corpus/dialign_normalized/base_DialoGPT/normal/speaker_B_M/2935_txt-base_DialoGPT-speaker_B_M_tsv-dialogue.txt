B|1| M: [uh] 
A|2| B: so right now we're _just_ 
B|3| M: _i don't know_ _it's just_ [been] raining _for a_ while . 
A|4| B: _yeah_ _we_ _we_ [just] try _to_ maintain _the_ lawn _and_ _the_ shrubs right now _and_ _the_ trees . _we _have_ a_ peach tree . _that's_ _the_ extent _of_ our um contributing _to_ our food supply . _but_ _that's_ nice _to_ _have_ 
B|5| M: _oh_ . 
A|6| B: _yeah ._ so _what do you_ _do_ up there ? 
B|7| M: _he_ smiles [and] nods 
A|8| B: um . 
B|9| M: _oh [yeah_ .] [what do you] _mean_ ? 
A|10| B: [oh] wow . 
B|11| M: _he_ _has_ [been] _out_ since [the] _last_ _day_ [of] _spring_ . 
A|12| B: [yeah .] 
B|13| M: _i don't know what_ [to] say _. _it's_ just_ _something_ _i've_ noticed . 
A|14| B: really . gosh . 
B|15| M: _well_ _i've_ [been] watching [the] show [for] [the] _last_ _year ._ 
A|16| B: [oh] boy 
B|17| M: _well_ _they're_ _all_ tomatoes . 
A|18| B: _that_ sounds wonderful . 
B|19| M: _i_ [have to] make _some_ [of] those plants [and] tomatoes . 
A|20| B: if [you] [don't] _have a_ frost you'll be [all] right _that's_ [what] [i] remember from living up north is _that_ you'd get everything set [and] then you'd _have a_ frost [and] half [the] stuff would get frostbitten [and] you'd [have to] . 
B|21| M: _i don't know_ _but it's_ [the] same _as_ _it's_ _always_ [been] . 
A|22| B: wow . uh-huh . 
B|23| M: _you ._ 
A|24| B: [oh] boy _that's_ frustrating . 
B|25| M: _you're_ [and] 
A|26| B: [oh yeah] _my_ husband does _that_ thank goodness because [i] _that's_ not [a] pleasure [for] me 
B|27| M: ahh [that's] interesting . [my] son _and _i_ do_ [the] mow [the] grass . 
A|28| B: [i] love gardens _that_ _are_ [well] tended [and _i] just_ there's [been] [a] few different places [i've] lived where [i've] [just] [i don't know] whether [it's] little old ladies living there or [what] [but] [you] could [just] tell _that_ they had [a] love [uh] [a] love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers [and] [just] [i] love [the] host [of] colors _that_ [just] keep coming [all] [you] [know] [year] _long_ . [and] [uh] [i] [i] was _in_ england once [and] [that's] one thing _that_ impressed me so much is no matter [what] size yard somebody had they had [a] beautiful _garden_ _in_ it . [you] [know] it could be three feet by four feet or [something] . 
B|29| M:  
A|30| B: so [i do] admire _that_ [but] [i] haven't really put [uh] _too_ much energy into it . course _we have_ two little kids _that_ _are_ two [and] three years old 
B|31| M:  
A|32| B: so _that_ [has] put [a] crimp _in_ [my] every activity other than diapers [and] laundry i'll tell [you] 
B|33| M: [the] . 
A|34| B: [yeah] [that's] really lovely . [i] would love [to] [have] different fruit trees [. it's] [it's] [been] wonderful [to] [have] [the] peaches . [they're] [just] delicious . [and] _we_ _we_ _we have_ still [have to] spray [some] [but] _we_ [don't] [have to] [just] asphyxiate ourself with [the] poison which is _good_ because _i just_ [i] can't _see_ [the] point _in_ doing _that_ [and] eating anything [out] [of] it afterwards . 
B|35| M:  
A|36| B: um we've tried them [but] again [it's just] like [the] sun scorch . 
B|37| M: [you] ? 
A|38| B: we've tried them _in_ kind [of] halfway _in the_ shade [and] halfway _in the_ [i] [mean] [it's just] [you] really really [have to] be prepared [to] _water_ constantly during [the] summer . 
B|39| M: _how long_ [what] ? 
A|40| B: people _that_ [have] [been] successful [out] here _have done_ this drip irrigation [and] installed _that_ 
B|41| M: [we [have] done] _that ._ 
A|42| B: [and] um [that's] really [what] makes [the] most sense because [you] [don't] [have to] use so much _water_ [and] 
B|43| M: [we] [do] [have a] [water] system . 
A|44| B: it really does [the] job . [but [it's] just] amazing [how] hot [and] dry [and] [for] [how long] it gets [out] here . [and] if [you're] not really committed [to] it [i] [mean] me _i'm_ [you] [know] _i'm_ real committed [to] it [for] about [a] week [and] then [i] forget about it [for a] week [and] then [i] go [oh yeah] [i] need [to] [do] [something] [and] by then [it's] burned up [you] [know] . 
B|45| M: i'e ? 
A|46| B: [it's just] _too_ distracting right now with these little ones _in_ our lives so maybe when [i] get older i'll find [uh] [some] joy _in_ [that] 
B|47| M: [i'm] [too] 
A|48| B: [yeah .] [yeah] it [just] gets so hot so fast here . [we] [don't] [have] really [a] [spring] or [a] fall 
B|49| M:  ... 
A|50| B: [and] it [just] [uh] immediately heats up . so [that's] one thing [i] miss about living up north [as] [i] remember um [you] [know] [the] [long] springs [and] [long] falls [and] [the] cooler weather . it was really nice . 
B|51| M: [you] ? 
A|52| B: [we] [always] had gardens when [i] was [uh] living _in_ chicago . _in_ fact [my] mother once tore up our entire back yard [and] redid it . i'll never forget . got [my] stepfather [to] put _in_ [uh] [a] waterfall [and] [a] little pond _in_ one corner . [i] [mean] [that] was like [the] most energy invested _in_ anything _in the_ whole time [i] ever knew him they remodeled [the] entire back yard . then they sold [the] house [and] got divorced so [i don't know what] [that] says about it [all] 
B|53| M:  
A|54| B: [oh] [but] she used [to] love [to] [do] stuff like [that .] 
B|55| M: sheroflip . 
A|56| B: [yeah] it really was . [i] enjoyed it there . [but] maybe when [the] boys get [a] little older we'll [do] [some] more planting because they like [to] _see_ things grow . they've [done] [a] couple [of] little seed projects [and] so _i think_ it would be fun [for] them . 
B|57| M: [that] ? 
A|58| B: [yeah] [yeah .] 
B|59| M: [i'm] sorry [i think] [i just] saw [you] [in the] [garden] [of] [my] friends . 
A|60| B: [oh] yes [they're] both running around now . 
B|61| M: [i don't] [think] [you can do] [that .] 
A|62| B: [yeah] [well] [it's] very therapeutic [i think] really [to] get [out] there [and] dig [in the] dirt [you] [know] . 
B|63| M: ah [i] [see] . 
A|64| B: they certainly enjoy [that] part [of] it [it's just] trying [to] keep anything . [i] planted bulbs [last] [uh] fall on [the] side guard [and] when [i] went [out] there [in the] [spring] [and] [the] first [day] they came [out] [the] little one went [and] pulled [all] [the] flowers off [and] [the] flower petals were scattered [all] over [the] walk 
B|65| M:  
A|66| B: [he] thought [what] _are_ these fun toys [that] mommy put [out] here with [all] these colors [for] me [to] play with ? at least [he] didn't eat them [i] [mean] [i] guess [i] could be thankful [for] [that .] 
B|67| M: [i'm] sorry 
A|68| B: [yeah] really . if they survive this [year .] [oh] [well] _good_ luck [to] [you .] 
B|69| M: [we] [are] [you] [too]
