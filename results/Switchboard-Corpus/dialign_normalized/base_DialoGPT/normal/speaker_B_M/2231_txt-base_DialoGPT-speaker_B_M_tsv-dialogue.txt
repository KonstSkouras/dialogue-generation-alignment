B|3| M: _so_ _do_ _you_ _think_ _that's_ _a good_ _idea_ ?

B|5| M: no _. _they_ can_ [be] _put_ _in jail_ [but] _if they're_ convicted _they_ _are_ _not_ _sentenced_ . 
A|6| B: because _if they_ turn around [they can] _get away_ _they get away_ with _it_ _and_ _they get away_ with _it_ _and_ _they get away_ with _it_ _and_ _then _they_ do_ something worse 
B|7| M: why [do] [they do] _this_ ?

A|22| B: [that's] _what_ [that's] _what_ people face with [that] choice . one _thing_ _i_ really hate _is_ [they] _don't_ explain _to the_ jurors [in] [a] [in] [a] trial [in] [a] capital murder trial or [in] cases _of_ rape or [in] different things [that] [are] [so] horrible _what_ _it_ means when [they] [sentence] them _to _you_ know_ they'll [sentence] them _to_ ninety years [and] say [that] _it's_ _you know_ [that] _it's_ going _to _you_ know_ 
B|23| M: i'm _not_ crying 
A|24| B: [that] should [be] life [but] instead [in] [in] given _the_ choice _of_ either sentencing _to death_ or sentencing _to_ life they'll give them ninety years [in prison] or something [and] _then_ turn around [in] thirty years [that] _you know_ [and] less [they're] out . 
B|25| M: [and] [to you] [to be] . 
A|26| B: even [if] [if they're] even [in] [that] long . or [they] _appeal_ [and] _then [they_ get] an _appeal_ [that] says _it_ _was_ _you know_ an unjust amount _of_ _time_ an extraordinary long length or something . 
B|27| M: [they] 
A|28| B: _yeah_ . i'd like [to] see _the death_ penalty more as [a] deterrent _i think_ people _know_ [that] nobody [that] _it_ doesn't _you know_ _it's not_ [a] deterrent right now because _it's not_ really effective . 
B|29| M: [you] 
A|30| B: there's should [be] _you know_ [this] for [this] crime [this] _is the_ penalty . [you] killed someone _you know_ [in] cold blood or whatever . 
B|31| M: no [of] [of] [you] 
A|32| B: [this] _is_ what's going [to] happen . 
B|33| M: i'm [not] sure . 
A|34| B: [and] _i_ mean _it_ sounds horrible . _it_ _i_ hear myself _saying_ [this] [and] _but _i don't_ _know_ what_ else _to do_ with some [of] these people [that] [are] 
B|35| M: _i [i_ think] [you] [got] [it] . 
A|36| B: because [they] let them back out again [and] [they do] _the_ same _thing_ over [and] over again 
B|37| M: why [is] [there] no reason [to do] [that] ? 
A|38| B: _then they_ [put] them back [in jail] [and] [they get] out [and and] more [and] more innocent people [are] hurt or killed 
B|39| M: [if they] _were_ [then they] [are] . 
A|40| B: [and] these guys _just_ [are] _on the_ endless merry-go-round _in the_ legal system . 
B|41| M: [they] _were_ . [they're] _still_ [on [the] death] row list . 
A|42| B: [and] _it's_ like [i] _said_ at our expense . 
B|43| M: [yeah] [they] _are [in_ jail] . 
A|44| B: yes . 
B|45| M: [do] [you] [think] [that the] us [is the] only country [that] does [that] ? 
A|46| B: _i know_ [i] [you] read about [it] _in the_ paper every day somebody who's done [this] or [that] something really horrible 
B|47| M: oh no _it's a_ big story . [it's not] news . 
A|48| B: [and] [they] _just_ _get away_ with [it] [and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: [they get away] _but [they_ get away] . 
A|50| B: [yeah] _. [i_ think] [i think] texas [is] texas [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] [still] _have_ [the death] penalty [and] [i think] _i know_ _california_ had [it] for [a] long _time_ [and] [then they] uh took [it] off [the] books [they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: [so] ... 
A|52| B: [and] people like charles manson [and and] some [of] these other people who [were] _sentenced to death_ at _the time_ [they] repealed [the death] penalty [were] _sentenced to_ life [in prison and] [are] now now [that] even though _california_ has reinstated [the death] penalty for whatever various crimes . [the] people who [were] [there] originally when [they] when [they] changed [the] laws [to] revoke [the death] penalty [are] [still] [in] [there] for [are [in] prison] [in] quote for life [and and] [are] now coming up for parole some [of] them like manson who's come up _you know_ 
B|53| M: [the] 
A|54| B: [it's] _been_ denied fortunately [but] 
B|55| M: [i] 
A|56| B: [yeah] . 
B|57| M: did [you know] ?? 
A|58| B: well [the] jury [that] [sentenced] him [sentenced] him _to death_ 
B|59| M: [you [know] what] [it's] [just] [a] joke . 
A|60| B: [and] [then] while _he was_ [on] _appeal_ [on] his thousandth [and] one _appeal_ [the] state [of] _california_ revoked [the] _law _in_ the_ early seventies [and] [then they] reinstated [it] later [but] [the] penalty didn't _go_ back . [you know] ? 
B|61| M: [i know] . i'm [just] [saying] [that] [he was] [sentenced to death] . 
A|62| B: [it] seems like [a] lot [of] times [the] _law_ [is] [is] totally [on the] _criminal_ side [and and] isn't protecting [the] rest _of the_ people . 
B|63| M: i'm sorry [but i don't] understand [the] [appeal] process . 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [i don't] [think] [there] [is] [a] [criminal] [law in] [california] [i think] 
A|66| B: [yeah] . [and] [the] [the] laws [are] _all the_ rules . some _of the_ things [that] _would_ make sense [to] [to] _tell_ [the] jury [that] [this] [this] guy has [a] [a] prior [criminal] history [you know] where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: [this] 
A|68| B: [and] [then] [he] gets up for [this] one trial [and] [they] [don't] finds anything out about [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M: hmmmm 
A|70| B: [and] [so] [they] say well [this] [is] [you know] [i _i] don't know_ [if they] say _it's the_ first _time_ offense or whatever [but they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] thinking he's [not] [a] habitual [criminal] . 
B|71| M: ayeaay 
A|72| B: [yeah] [yeah] . well [to] some extent [if they] _would_ [do] something with some [of] those people . [but] [that] seems [to be] [a good] way [to] [get] off for [a] lot [of] them too . 
B|73| M: [this] . 
A|74| B: [they] plead insanity 
B|75| M: [they] [said] they'd [do] [it] . 
A|76| B: [and] [then] three years later [they're] cured [and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: [what] [if they] die ? 
A|78| B: [i] mean [it's a] [it's a] scary _world_ out [there] anymore where your _afraid_ _to go_ out 
B|79| M: [they do] [it] [all [the] time] [. [i] don't] [think] [they're] [afraid] [of the] consequences . 
A|80| B: [i know] [in] _in the_ _dallas_ metroplex area [i don't] _go_ out hardly [if] [i don't] _have_ [to] at night by myself 
B|81| M: [it's [a] good] [thing] [you] [don't] live [in] [dallas] _i would_ [have] [been] terrified [to go] [to the] airport alone . 
A|82| B: [and] [i i] certainly [i i] grew up [in] [a] smaller town [in] texas [and] [it] wasn't [that] way when _i was_ younger . 
B|83| M: no [it's the] opposite . 
A|84| B: we could [go] around [and] boy [and] 
B|85| M: i've [been] [to the] very top [of the] [world] [and] i'm [in the] very bottom [of the] earth . 
A|86| B: yes . ever [you] can't even when _i was_ [a] kid [i would] run between my neighbors three [and] four blocks sometimes [and] as long as my mom had [a] general [idea] where _i was_ [and] _i was_ back [on [the] time] 
B|87| M: [that's] 
A|88| B: [and] now [i don't] let my kids out [of the] front yard [that] [i] can't see them . 
B|89| M: [i was] sooooo 
A|90| B: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: i'm [not] sure [but i] [can] [tell] [you] i'm [not] [you] 
A|92| B: well [good] talking [to you] too . bye
