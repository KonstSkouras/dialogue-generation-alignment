B|35| M: [i] ,,, [i think] ,, [you] ,, [got] [it] .

B|37| M: why [is] [there] no reason [to do] [that] ?

A|42| B: [and] _it's_ like [i] _said_ at our expense .

A|44| B: yes . 
B|45| M: [do] [you] [think] [that] [the] us [is the] only country [that] does [that] ? 
A|46| B: _i know_ _, i_ [, you] read about [it] _in the_ paper , every day , somebody who's done [this] , or [that ,] something really horrible 
B|47| M: oh , no _, it's a_ big story . [it's not] news . 
A|48| B: [and] [they] _just_ _get away_ with [it] [, and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: [they [get away] _,] but [they_ get away] . 
A|50| B: [yeah] _. [i_ think] [i think] texas [is] texas , [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] [still] _have_ [the death] penalty [, and] [i think] _, _i_ know_ _california_ had [it] for [a] long _time_ [, and] [then they] , uh , took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: [so] ... 
A|52| B: [and] people like charles manson [, and , and] some [of] these other people , who [were] _sentenced to death_ at _the time_ [they] repealed [the death] penalty , [were] _sentenced to_ life [in prison , and] [are] now , now [that] even though _california_ has reinstated [the death] penalty , for whatever various crimes . [the] people who [were] [there] originally , when [they] , when [they] changed [the] laws [to] revoke [the death] penalty , [are] [still] [in] [there] for , [are [in] prison ,] [in] quote , for life [, and , and] [are] now coming up for parole , some [of] them , like manson who's come up _you know_ 
B|53| M: [the] 
A|54| B: [it's] _been_ denied fortunately [but] , 
B|55| M: [i] 
A|56| B: [yeah] . 
B|57| M: did [you know] ?? 
A|58| B: well , [the] jury [that] [sentenced] him , [sentenced] him _to death_ 
B|59| M: [you [know] [what] [,] it's] [just] [a] joke . 
A|60| B: [and] [then] while _he was_ [on] _appeal_ [on] his thousandth [and] one _appeal_ , [the] state [of] _california_ revoked [the] _law _in_ the_ early seventies [, and] [then they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty didn't _go_ back . [you know] ? 
B|61| M: [i know] . i'm [just] [saying] [that] [he was] [sentenced to death] . 
A|62| B: [it] seems like [a] lot [of] times [the] _law_ [is] , [is] totally [on the] _criminal_ side [, and , and] isn't protecting [the] rest _of the_ people . 
B|63| M: i'm sorry [, but] _i don't_ understand [the] [appeal] process . 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: _i don't_ [think] [there] [is] [a] [criminal] [law in] [california] [, i think] 
A|66| B: [yeah] . [and] [the] , [the] laws [are] _all_ , [the] rules . some _of the_ things [that] _would_ make sense [to [,] to] _tell_ [the] jury [, that] [this] , [this] guy has [a] , [a] prior [criminal] history [, [you] know] , where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: [this] 
A|68| B: [and] [then] [he] gets up for [this] one trial [, and] [they] [don't] finds anything out about [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M: hmmmm 
A|70| B: [and] [so] [they] say , well , [this] [is] [, [you] know] [, i] [, _i] don't know_ [if they] say _it's the_ first _time_ offense or whatever [, but they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] , thinking he's [not] [a] habitual [criminal] . 
B|71| M: ayeaay 
A|72| B: [yeah ,] [yeah] . well [, to] some extent [if they] _would_ [do] something with some [of] those people . [but] [that] seems [to be] [a good] way [to] [get] off for [a] lot [of] them too . 
B|73| M: [this] . 
A|74| B: [they] plead insanity 
B|75| M: [they] [said] they'd [do] [it] . 
A|76| B: [and] [then] three years later [they're] cured [, and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: [what] [if they] die ? 
A|78| B: [i] mean [, it's a] [it's a] scary _world_ out [there] anymore , where your _afraid_ _to go_ out , 
B|79| M: [they do] [it] [all] [the time] [. [i] don't] [think] [they're] [afraid] [of the] consequences . 
A|80| B: [i know] , [in] , _in the_ _dallas_ metroplex area [, [i] don't] _go_ out hardly [if] [i don't] _have_ [to] at night by myself 
B|81| M: [it's [a] good] [thing] [you] [don't] live [in] [dallas] _, i would_ [have] [been] terrified [to go] [to the] airport alone . 
A|82| B: [and] [i] [, i] certainly [, i] [, i] grew up [in] [a] smaller town [in] texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way when _i was_ younger . 
B|83| M: no [, [it's] the] opposite . 
A|84| B: we could [go] around [, and ,] boy [and ,] 
B|85| M: i've [been] [to the] very top [of the] [world] [and] i'm [in the] very bottom [of the] earth . 
A|86| B: yes . ever [, you] can't even , when _i was_ [a] kid [, i would] run between my neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and ,] as long as my mom had [a] general [idea] where _i was_ [and] _i was_ back [on [the] time] , 
B|87| M: [that's] 
A|88| B: [and] now [i don't] let my kids out [of the] front yard [, that] [i] can't see them . 
B|89| M: [i was] sooooo 
A|90| B: uh-huh . 
B|91| M: i'm [not] sure [, but] [i] [can] [tell] [you] , i'm [not] [, you]
