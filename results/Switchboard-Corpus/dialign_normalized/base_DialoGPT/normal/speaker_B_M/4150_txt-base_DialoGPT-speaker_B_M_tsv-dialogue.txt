A|44| B: [my] husband is [a] physician [, _so] ,_ uh [, i] [, i] [i] talk [to] parents [about] [this] [a] lot [. but] children [, i] [, [i] think] working mothers [or] mothers who choose [to] work outside [the] home , um , need very early [to] come [to] grips [with] any guilt , [that] [they] [feel] [and] decide [what's] best for them [and] their [family] . 
B|45| M:  ... 
A|46| B: [and] [i feel] when [my] children _were_ very young [, i] [had] jobs [that] helped me be flexible [with] [my] schedule [and] spend time [with] them [and] all [that] sort of [thing .] [and] [i] long ago decided [i'm a] better mother [because] [i] work outside [the] home .

A|50| B: [so] [i] [know] [it] sounds [like] [a] rationalization [but] [it's] [, i] really [think] [it's] true for our [family ,] [and] [i think] [it] has worked very [well] . 
B|51| M: [you] 
A|52| B: there's [no] question [, [i] think] [that's] really [the] best . [if] , [if] [a] woman is happy doing [that] , 
B|53| M: _your_ [right] . 
A|54| B: _i hate to_ put [it] quite [that way .] 
B|55| M: [well] [i hate to] say [it] _, but_ ...

B|57| M: _she's_ [like] , 10 [years] old . 
A|58| B: [it's a] wonderful , [it's] wonderful [to] be [a] mother [but] , uh [, [i] like] [i like] [the] [way] [i] did [it] . 
B|59| M: [you're] [a] terrible parent . 
A|60| B: [i] sort of worked half time [. i] [had] very flexible hours [. i] nursed all three of our children until _they were_ at least [a year] [and] [i] , [you] can [do] [that] despite working very easily [which] is [one] of [the] things [i] preach all [the] time [to] , [to] mothers . 
B|61| M:  
A|62| B: um , [and] [i think] we choose very , very carefully [the] , um , alternative situations [that] we [had] them [in] . 
B|63| M: [what] [do] [you] [think] ? 
A|64| B: some baby-sitting groups , again [, i] [know] [it] sounds [like] [a] rationalization [, [but] i] really [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early on [are] _around_ lots of other children [and] [they] , [they] learn [to] share [. they] learn [not] necessarily [to] be [the] center of attention [but] [that] at [the] same time we [have to] be [sure] [they are] secure . 
B|65| M: [yes ,] 
A|66| B: [i think] [that] helps . 
B|67| M: yeah [, but] [what] [if] [they were] [around] , too ?
