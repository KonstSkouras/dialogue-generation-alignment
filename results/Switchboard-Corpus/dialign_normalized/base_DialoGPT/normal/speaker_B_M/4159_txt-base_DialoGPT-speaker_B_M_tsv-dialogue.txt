B|11| M:  
A|12| B: [i] , _i think_ _it_ has [to be] some kind of common sense applied _there ._ _and_ _there_ may [be] where _the_ judiciary _is_ _a_ little more learned about _that_ type of thing because [they] can [be] schooled in _that_ kind of thing ,

A|20| B: _if_ _it's a_ company _, you know_ [that] they're insured . unless _the_ award [is] so staggering [that] _it_ goes all beyond their layers of insurance which [is] another pet peeve of mine when [they] do award punitive damages , 
B|21| M: [i think] [it's] 
A|22| B: [i think] those _should be_ uninsurable _. i think_ those _should_ [have to _be] paid_ by _the_ corporation itself [that] , [that] did _the damage_ . 
B|23| M: [should [be] paid] ? 
A|24| B: yeah . yeah . 
B|25| M: [are] [you] referring _to [the_ damage] ? 
A|26| B: for , for honest mistakes where they've done something _and , and_ something happens . one of their employees causes [damage] or something . _sure_ . that's _what_ [they] buy insurance for . 
B|27| M:  ... [what] ? 
A|28| B: well , [i] was just talking about any company . uh , let's just say _a_ lumber manufacturing company 
B|29| M: umm [. i think] i'd [be] okay [with that .] 
A|30| B: _and ,_ uh , somebody [is] on [the] premises 
B|31| M:  ... [and , and [,] you know ,] 
A|32| B: [and] one of [the] employees actually [is] driving by [with] _a_ forklift [and] he pushes [the] wrong button [and] he drops _a_ load of lumber on somebody [and] _it_ injures , them . 
B|33| M: [it's] [not] [a] coincidence . 
A|34| B: _sure_ . insurance [should] pay for [that .] 
B|35| M: [not] [sure] [if] you're serious . 
A|36| B: well i'm [not] talking about any loss [. i] was talking about only losses [that] [are] judged for [a] punitive [damage] which [is] another category of , [the] juries [are] awarding damages these days based on [the] person's actual injuries [and] [what] [they] [are] due . [and] then [they] [are] awarding [a] second amount as punishment [to the] company which [is] [a] usually [a] lot less . _but_ [it's] an , an amount they're , designed [to] sting them [a] little for their , negligence . for gross wanton negligence in [a] claim . 
B|37| M:  
A|38| B: [and] unfortunately [the] [the] , lately [the] courts [have] been deciding [that] those could [be paid] for by insurance too . 
B|39| M: self . 
A|40| B: so again , _it_ never really penalizes , [the] company doing [the] wrong . 
B|41| M: [it's a] . 
A|42| B: [they] can go right on doing [the] same old thing [they] always used [to] . 
B|43| M: [what] [if they] can't afford [it] ? 
A|44| B: [and] [if] , [if they] [know] some practice [is] wrong [, you know ,] i'm [not] talking about your isolated occurrences , i'm talking more about [the] [, you know ,] [the] thing [that] [they] [know ,] maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] [know] [is] hurting [people] out [there] [and] [they] continue [to] do [it] even after [they] become aware of [that .] 
B|45| M: yes , [but] [the] risk [is] still [there .] 
A|46| B: then [i think] [they] ought [to] [have to] pay something out of their own pocket .
