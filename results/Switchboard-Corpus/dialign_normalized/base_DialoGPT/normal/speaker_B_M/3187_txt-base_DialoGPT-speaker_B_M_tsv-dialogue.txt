A|0| B: um well _the_ see uh well we _he_ wanted _to_ get into _a_ mennonite nursing home which _is_ _very_ popular _and_ hard _to_ get into _and_ had like _a_ ten year waiting _list_ 
B|1| M: _you_ ? 
A|2| B: right we wound up just choosing _a_ another mennonite nursing home _that_ _was_ easier _to_ get into . or but naturally _no_ it _was_ even mennonite related _i'm sorry_ it _was_ actually _not_ _a_ particularly great nursing home . mostly _the_ thing _was_ _that_ it _was_ available when we needed it because _he_ suddenly got sick _and_ needed _to_ be put in . 
B|3| M: [that] . 
A|4| B: uh _what_ do [you] _think_ ? 
B|5| M: [no] i' 
A|6| B: uh-huh . 
B|7| M: it's awwwwwww . 
A|8| B: yeah . 
B|9| M: uhm ... [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|10| B: yeah 
B|11| M: _so_ did [you] _have_ [a] choice ?

B|13| M: [you] can always move her out _of_ [the] _house_ . 
A|14| B: okay . 
B|15| M: [i] _have_ [a] friend [that] works there . [i'm] sure she can give [you] [a] [list] _of_ [what] she's doing [and] [what] she [is] doing . 
A|16| B: yeah . 
B|17| M: yourself . she's 
A|18| B: right [and] [that] becomes difficult then . 
B|19| M: she's [not] there anymore . 
A|20| B: uh-huh . yep we tried _to_ convince my grandfather _to_ live with us at several points during [the] last few years [of] his life but _he was_ essentially too proud [and] too independent [so] [that] even though his heart _was_ getting incredibly weak [and] his knees were going bad _he_ lived in his own [house] as long as _he_ could 
B|21| M: [i] 
A|22| B: but _he was_ living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up [the] steps _to_ [the] top without [a] great deal [of] pain 
B|23| M: [i] [think] . 
A|24| B: [and] this eventually things just went too far 
B|25| M: [i] [was] [not] talking about [that] [i] [was] talking 
A|26| B: [and] _he_ allowed himself _to_ be put into [a] nursing home . 
B|27| M: [he was] [a] [very] nice man . 
A|28| B: right 
B|29| M: [i'm] [not] really [a] guy . 
A|30| B: well that's yeah that's right [that] [the] children [have] some _responsibility_ too _to_ their parents [and] such _to_ help decide what's [the] right thing . 
B|31| M: [i] mean [the] kids'parents [have] [a] [responsibility] [to] take care [of] them . 
A|32| B: [and] . 
B|33| M: she [is] here . 
A|34| B: uh-huh . 
B|35| M: [i'm sorry] [i] don't know .
