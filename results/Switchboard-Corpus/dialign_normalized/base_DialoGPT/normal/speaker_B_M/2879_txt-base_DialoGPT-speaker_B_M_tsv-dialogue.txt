A|106| B: [yeah] [that] would be even [yeah i] didn't even [think] about [that] . 
B|107| M: [oh yeah] [uh] [no] 
A|108| B: [i think] 
B|109| M: [there is] [no] way [i think the] us [is the] only country [that] [have the] ratio [of] people [to] each other . 
A|110| B: [yeah] _there's more_ [that] [don't] [have] [it] _but_ amazingly [it's] [like] [uh] massachusetts went back [and] reinstated capital [punishment] [oh] maybe six [or] seven years ago 
B|111| M: [there's more] [of] [a] difference between [this] [and the] death penalty 
A|112| B: [i don't know] _if_ they've used [it] since then since they've reinstated [it] _but_ [uh] [it's] on [the] books . 
B|113| M: [not] [sure] [if] you're aware [but the] federal prison system [is] [a] federal [crime] . 
A|114| B: [right] .
