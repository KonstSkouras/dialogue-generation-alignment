A|110| B: [yeah ,] _there's more_ [that] [don't] [have] [it] _but_ amazingly [it's] [like] [, uh ,] massachusetts went back [, and] reinstated capital [punishment] , [oh] , maybe six [or] seven years ago , 
B|111| M: [there's more] [of] [a] difference between [this] [and the] death penalty 
A|112| B: [i don't know] _if_ they've used [it] since then since they've reinstated [it] _but_ [, uh [,] it's] on [the] books .
