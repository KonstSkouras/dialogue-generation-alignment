B|1| M: _you_ _have_ _to_ _be_ [a] [murderer] _to_ _have_ [a] choice . 
A|2| B: or 
B|3| M: uhh it's not illegal . 
A|4| B: well for some things . 
B|5| M: you're not _in_ [a] position _to_ make decisions _about_ _it_ you're _a person_ . 
A|6| B: _i think_ for serial murder _it is_ warranted _because_ _if_ [a person] who _would_ _do something_ _like_ _that_ [in] cold blood 
B|7| M: [i mean] it's not [like] anyone [is] _going to_ [do something] _about_ [it] . 
A|8| B: [i mean] _you can't_ guarantee _that they_ wouldn't escape from prison and _do it_ again . 
B|9| M: [you can't] say [that] _about_ [a] [murderer] . 
A|10| B: and _i don't_ _think_ [that] [that] rehabilitation [is] effective . 
B|11| M: [because] he did [it] . 
A|12| B: _but_ then [you] know _i think_ [that] [that] some murderers _don't_ really warrant capital punishment . [you] know just [like] for example uh [you] know [you] hear [about] cases where women [have] killed their husbands who abused them 
B|13| M:  
A|14| B: and _i don't_ _think_ [that] _would_ really warrant capital punishment . 
B|15| M:  ... 
A|16| B: uh _it is_ [to] [a] certain extent 
B|17| M: you're 
A|18| B: _but_ _i think_ _i don't_ know [because] 
B|19| M: [i think] you've got _the_ wrong impression . 
A|20| B: [i think] [in] and [it] just _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances and and [the] extent of [the] abuse and and _if_ another alternative was available . 
B|21| M: [if] [they] were not [in] jail how did [they] [do it] ? 
A|22| B: well [i think] [that] _would_ [be] kind of drastic punishment . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: and 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: _but_ one thing [i think] [that] [if] there [is] [a] chance for rehabilitation then [that] chance should [be] investigated . 
B|27| M: [i'm] not saying it's impossible . [i'm] saying [it is] . 
A|28| B: _but_ [like] [i] said [if] [if] someone [is] [is] just pathologically [going to] murder people no matter what then [i think] [they] should [be] eliminated from society . 
B|29| M: [i'm] not sure [if] [you] _are_ saying [that] [but] it's not [that] [i don't] want [to] [be] murdered [i'm] saying [i] [would] rather [be] rehabilitated . 
A|30| B: [but] 
B|31| M: [i] agree with [you] . [i'm] not saying [that they] _are a danger_ . 
A|32| B: and [a] lot of people [that] [are a danger] [to] society [that] aren't [in] prison .
