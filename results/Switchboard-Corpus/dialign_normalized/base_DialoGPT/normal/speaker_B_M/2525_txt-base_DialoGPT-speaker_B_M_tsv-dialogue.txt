B|3| M: [i] ? 
A|4| B: _and_ _, uh _,_ it_ _didn't_ seem _like_ _it_ _was_ _that_ congested _in that_ , _that_ part . _you know_ _because_ _to_ me where _we_ live _out_ _here_ _in the_ north east _, it_ , _it's_ _there_ _are_ _a_ lot _of_ buildings very close _to_ each other , 
B|5| M:  . 
A|6| B: _and_ _the_ cities _are_ very populated _with_ tenement housing , where _there_ _are_ more than one family _in a_ house . _and_ _with_ _the , uh ,_ _people_ _that_ _are_ coming into _the_ _country_ _from_ other countries , _not_ knowing _the_ language 
B|7| M:  
A|8| B: _and_ _, uh ,_ _they're_ _going to_ _the_ big cities . _it_ makes _it_ very difficult . 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: _it_ really does _, and_ _, and_ _i've_ seen _the_ same _thing_ _that_ _you're_ _talking about_ _, uh ,_ _much_ more _crime_ than ever _before_ . drugs _of_ course _, uh ,_ _a_ big part _of_ _it_ _i think_ . 
B|11| M: _i'm not_ _sure_ _if_ [i'm] missing 
A|12| B: _and_ _, uh ,_ _i _don't_ _know_ ,_ _a_ lot _of_ younger _people_ _, you know ,_ into more violent crimes . 
B|13| M: [uh [,] _yeah] ._ 
A|14| B: _that_ _, that's_ really sad _, you know _,_ you_ got young boys or girls , _that_ at fourteen or twelve years old _that_ _are_ committing murders _and_ , _no_ remorse , _what_ _so_ ever . 
B|15| M: _this , uh ,_ reminds 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [that's] [a] pretty cool [thing] _to _do_ ._ 
A|18| B: _it_ _is_ _and_ _, and _i_ _don't_ know_ [if] _it's , uh _,_ the_ family _, you know ,_ [thing] where _they're not_ bonding anymore , where mothers _are_ working _all the_ _time_ _and_ _, the_ kids aren't getting _the_ attention _that_ _they_ need , or _the_ television . 
B|19| M: [i don't] [think] [that's] 
A|20| B: _and _i_ ,_ [i] really [think] _that_ _we're_ , _we're_ falling by _the_ wayside _with_ [not] incarcerating these _people ._ 
B|21| M: [i think] [you're] _right_ . 
A|22| B: [uh [,] uh] . 
B|23| M: [i think] [that's] [a] 
A|24| B: _yeah ,_ exactly . 
B|25| M: _and [it's_ , uh ,] _prison_ . 
A|26| B: [and] [, uh _,] you know _,_ they_ had [, uh ,] _in_ fact on _the_ news last night _we_ _were_ watching [this , uh ,] man _who_ lost his ten year old daughter . _he_ ran _out_ [to] _the_ store _for a_ few minutes [and] _he_ had left her home alone . now ten years old , she's old enough _to be_ alone _for a_ few minutes _, you know_ . 
B|27| M: youself 
A|28| B: [and] _while_ _he was_ gone , _he_ had looked , went looking _for a_ job [and] stopped at _the_ store _, that's_ _what_ _it_ _was_ . [and] [, uh ,] _someone_ _who_ _was _in_ the_ neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , went _in_ , raped _the_ girl , murdered her _, and_ _the_ whole bit . 
B|29| M: [you know] 
A|30| B: [and] one _of_ _the_ men got [, uh ,] [i think] _it_ _was_ seventeen years [and] _the_ other one _was in_ _for_ [, uh ,] life imprisonment . 
B|31| M: _this ._ 
A|32| B: _the_ one _that_ _was in_ _for_ _the_ seventeen years , actually served seven _, and_ he's _out_ . 
B|33| M: [he [was] [in] a] [time] [out] 
A|34| B: [and] _the_ man _said_ , _that_ _, you know _,_ if_ _it_ weren't _for_ _the_ fact _that_ [he] _would_ go [to] _jail ,_ _that_ [he] _would_ eliminate [this] person himself . [and] _then_ go [to] mcdonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] [not] [thing] [a] [thing] , [think] [a] [thing] _about it_ . 
B|35| M: [i don't] [think] [so] . 
A|36| B: _and i_ _mean_ , [i think] _that_ _what_ _this is_ _going to_ lead [to] _is_ _people_ will take things into their _own_ hands . [and] _that_ innocent _people_ , 
B|37| M: _i think it's_ [going [to] be] [a] _good_ 
A|38| B: _i ,_ [i] shouldn't say innocent _, because_ [i] _mean_ , actually _if they_ commit [a] _crime_ _that_ _they're_ _in the_ same circumstances _but_ , 
B|39| M: _well [,_ the] judge [said] 
A|40| B: [the] reasons _that_ _they're_ doing _it_ compared [to] [the] reason _someone_ else _is_ _in jail_ _for_ _it_ _, you know ,_ [it's] _like_ two different things . 
B|41| M: [what] [are] [you] [talking about] ? 
A|42| B: sometimes when [you] lose _someone_ _that_ [you] really love _, you_ [do] some crazy things [i _don't] _know_ ,_ 
B|43| M: [i] [know ,] [i've] _been_ [there] [for a] [while] . 
A|44| B: _i ,_ [i] _like_ [the] idea _that_ [, uh _,] _if_ someone is_ _from_ [a] foreign _country_ _, and_ _they_ come [to] [this] _country_ [and] [uh ,] commit , [a] _crime_ , [i think] _that_ irregardless _of_ whether _they_ _have_ already become [a] citizen or anything _, _they_ _should_ be_ immediately deported . 
B|45| M: [so] ... 
A|46| B: especially [if] _they're_ found _guilty_ _of_ _the crime_ . 
B|47| M: [if they] [are] [not] convicted , [then] [they] [are] considered _guilty ._ 
A|48| B: _you know ,_ once [they] _, they_ _have been_ arrested [and] [if they] [know] beyond [a] shadow _of a_ doubt , these _people_ _are [guilty_ .] 
B|49| M: [no] _, _but_ they_ [are] . 
A|50| B: [that's] _it_ , _we_ [don't] take care _of_ _them_ , _we_ [don't] support _them_ , nothing , 
B|51| M: [so] [do] _we [have_ a] policy _against_ those [who] [don't know] [the crime] ? 
A|52| B: [i] _mean_ [they] go [right] back where [they] came _from_ . 
B|53| M: [what] ? [you] [mean] [the] _ones that_ [were] [there] [before] [you] ? 
A|54| B: exactly [and] , 
B|55| M: [they] can't [, because] [they're not] [a] [country] . 
A|56| B: [but] [that's] [, uh ,] [they're] _, so_ close , _i ,_ [i don't] consider mexican _people_ _in the_ same category _with_ [, uh ,] especially _like_ [, uh ,] _people who_ come _from_ cultures [that] [don't] [have] [the] same [, uh ,] kind _of_ moral upbringing [that] [we have] . 
B|57| M: [i'm] sorry . 
A|58| B: _like_ [you] take asian countries , or [, uh [,] the] eastern countries where women [are] _like_ _in the_ _foreground_ [, uh ,] _in the_ background [and] [the] men _are in the_ _foreground_ , 
B|59| M: [the , uh ,] [foreground] ? 
A|60| B: [and it's] _like_ _, you know ,_ um _, they_ live back [in] where [we] came _from_ two hundred years ago . 
B|61| M: [it's] 
A|62| B: _you know ,_ we've advanced beyond [that] _, and [i_ think] [that] their [, uh ,] mentality as far as [the] way [they] treat _them_ [and] [that] kind _of_ [thing] _, you know_ [what] [i] [mean] . 
B|63| M:  ... [but] [the] men's bathroom ? 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [i'm] ... _i'm not_ _sure_ [, you know _,] how_ [it] works . 
A|66| B: [yeah .] 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: wow . 
B|69| M: [i] . 
A|70| B: wow . [you] better _believe_ [it] _, if_ [, you] _wouldn't_ even [have] [to] _leave it_ , [i] [mean] , 
B|71| M: [no] 
A|72| B: _it would_ get snatched [right] off your arm 
B|73| M: [if] [you] could just [leave it] [in the] car [, [it] would] [be] nice . 
A|74| B: oh [sure] . 
B|75| M: _well [,_ the] only [thing] [i] [would] [be] afraid [of] [is] [the] possibility [of a] potential kidnapping [if someone is] _there [,_ and _i] wouldn't_ want [to be] _in that situation ._ 
A|76| B: [that's] amazing , [well ,] _what's the_ difference [there ,] [do] [you know] ? 
B|77| M: [well i] am [from] texas [and i] can't [believe] [i] [didn't] [think] [about] 
A|78| B: oh , _i ,_ [i] [believe] [in _the] death_ penalty , [i] really [do .] 
B|79| M: [if] [you're] [not] [sure] [, you] [should be] . 
A|80| B: _yeah [,_ _yeah] ,_ [i think] [that] _we're_ too easy . 
B|81| M: [so] [is] [that] [the death] sentence ? 
A|82| B: [uh [,] and] [we] take [the [,] [the] , uh ,] civil liberties [, uh ,] stuff too far . 
B|83| M: [i'm] sorry _, but i _think_ we're_ [all] [out] [of] ideas _here ._ 
A|84| B: [you know] _like people_ [that] _are in_ [prison] , [i] [mean] [we] [didn't] put _them_ [there] . [they] put themselves [in that situation .] 
B|85| M: uhhh , [like _people] who [are_ [in] [jail] [,] uh ,] huh . 
A|86| B: [and] as far as [like] _them_ [, uh ,] entertaining [the] rights [that] _they should have_ . 
B|87| M: uhh [, uh ,] interesting . 
A|88| B: [i] [mean] , [we] educate _them_ , [we] feed _them_ , [we] take care [of] _them_ [and] [they] [no] sooner get [out] on [the] street [and] [they're] back [in] again . 
B|89| M: [so] [what's the] deal [with] [them] ? 
A|90| B: [i'm not] _saying_ _they're all_ _bad_ [, but i think] [people who _are] guilty_ [of] really serious heinous crimes , [do] [not] deserve [to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] their lives . 
B|91| M: [well [,] [if] they] [are guilty] [, they] [are] [not] [bad] [people .] 
A|92| B: [i think] [that] _they [should_ be] put away . 
B|93| M: [yeah [,] _but] [they_ should [have] been] . 
A|94| B: get rid [of] [them] . exactly . _i ,_ [i] really , _i ,_ [i think] [that] _that's the_ whole key [here .] [this] plea bargaining baloney , where [, uh [,] you know [,] they] plead [to] [a] lesser [crime] , or [, uh [,] they] plead [guilty] [in] , or [, you know ,] tell [about] [someone] else [and] [they] [, they] get less [time] , 
B|95| M: [i ,] eh ? 
A|96| B: or [, if] [they're] [in] [there] [and] they've got seventeen years [and] [they're] on [good] behavior , [for] every year [they're] [in] [they] get [so] many less [, you know ,] [that] [they] [don't] serve [the] full penalty . 
B|97| M: [i'm] 
A|98| B: [i ,] [i ,] [i] really [think we're] [going to] far overboard [with] [all] [of] [this .] 
B|99| M: h . 
A|100| B: [yeah ,] same [with] drunk drivers . 
B|101| M: [this is] [a] great point . 
A|102| B: [i think it's] too easy [for] [them] . 
B|103| M: [so] [you're] [saying] _there's_ [a] chance ? 
A|104| B: [that] [if] [the [,] the] laws [, and] [, and] [were] , [were] harsher [and] [were] enforced , 
B|105| M: [well i] guess [that's the] law 
A|106| B: [i] [mean] [you] [have] [to] set an example . [you] [have] [to] start somewhere . 
B|107| M: [this is] [what] [i'm] [saying] . 
A|108| B: [and [i] think] [that] [people] [know] [that] [they're] [going to] get [a] slap on [the] wrist [, they] might serve [a] little bit [of] [time] [and] [that] they'll [be] [out] on [the] street again . 
B|109| M: [they] [are in the] uk 
A|110| B: an [, it] , an [i] feel [bad] [for] [the] policeman [, because] he's [out] [there] every day facing these [people .] [this ,] [this] craziness [, you know ,] [people] [with] [, uh ,] automatic weapons [and] [, uh ,] [all] [this] other stuff [and] trying [to do] [a] job 
B|111| M: ugh [, [that's] the] [thing] . 
A|112| B: [and] let's face [it] , [what] [do] [they] get paid . 
B|113| M: [i think it's] [because] [the] police [are] trained 
A|114| B: twenty thousand dollars [a] year [, if] [they're] lucky . [i wouldn't] [do] [it] [for] [that] . 
B|115| M: _how_ [much] ? 
A|116| B: [it] [is] [, it] really [is] . [and i] [mean] , [they're] [the] first [ones that] take [the] brunt [of] everything . 
B|117| M: [is] [it] legal [to] [own] [a] 
A|118| B: [you know [,] and] [i'm not] [saying] [that] _they're all_ [good] either [, because] [there's] [good] [and] [bad] [in] everything , 
B|119| M: [i don't] [like] [to] _talk_ [about it] 
A|120| B: [but they] , [they're] already [, uh ,] [have] three strikes [against] [them] when [they're] [out] [there] . 
B|121| M: [they're [all] the] best [, so] [that's] _all that_ matters . 
A|122| B: [because] they'll arrest [someone] [and] [, you know ,] go through [all that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this [,] and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and] [you] [have] [to] even [be] careful [how] [you] arrest [them] [, how] [you] [talk] [to] [them] [, uh [,] you know ,] [what] [they] say ,
