A|58| B: _so_ you'd , you'd rather see [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
B|59| M: _that's [a_ lot] easier [to] [do] than [you think] [it] [is] .

B|75| M: [i] [did] _, and_ he _still_ owes [me] . 
A|76| B: [well [,] you] could probably [sue him] [for] mental anguish [or] something , _right [,_ and] try [to] _get_ _money_ [from] [him] 
B|77| M: [i] am [not] even sure _if_ he has [any] idea _what i_ am [doing] . 
A|78| B: [and] ,

A|80| B: _yeah_ . [makes] [you] wish [that] had _, uh ,_ [still] had indentured servitude _, for_ [this] sort [of] [thing .] 
B|81| M: [i'm] sure they'll [be] fine [, it's not] [like] they'll [sue] [you] [for] [it .]

A|96| B: [yeah] . 
B|97| M: [you] [mean] [like] [the] vigilante [that] gave [you] [the] ticket ? 
A|98| B: uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [that's] [what] [i'm] saying . 
A|100| B: _oh ,_ _my_ god . 
B|101| M: [and] _we_ [have] [a lot of] guns [, you know [,] like] [a] gun . 
A|102| B: _right_ . 
B|103| M: [so] they'll wait [, uh [,] for] _someone_ [to] [do] [it] [, uh] . 
A|104| B: _right_ . 
B|105| M: [this is] [why] [i] always go [to] [the] bathroom [in the] morning . 
A|106| B: uh-huh . 
B|107| M: [oh [,] that's] [right ,] [i'm] [not] arresting everyone .

B|113| M: [i'm] pretty sure _you're_ [not] supposed [to] shoot anyone [who] isn't [armed] _with_ [a] gun . 
A|114| B: _here_ [you] break [in [,] and you're] [going to] [get] shot . 
B|115| M: [i] [have] [a] friend who's [been] living [in] [a] house [for] 2 years [and] he's got [a] gun . 
A|116| B: uh-huh . 
B|117| M: heh , [the guy] [in the] video said [that] he broke [in] . 
A|118| B: uh-huh . 
B|119| M: what's [that] ? 
A|120| B: _huh ._

A|130| B: [yeah] . uh-huh [. [i] mean , i] [, i] tend [to] agree [with] _you [._ [i] think] [, uh [,] [what] [i] would] [like] [to] see [is] , number [one] , completely getting rid [of] these victimless crimes [. uh ,] there's [no] reason [to] enforce those [and] spend [time] [and] [money] [doing] [it] [and] [, and] worry [about] these things [where] [people] [are] getting hurt . 
B|131| M: [you .] 
A|132| B: [and] [i think] [one of] [the] big things [that] [you can] [do] [is] , [to] increase deterrence [is] [, uh ,] [if] [someone] [is] found [guilty] [of a] [, uh ,] felony level offense , [they] lose their citizenship . [and] [they] lose their constitutional rights [. [you] know ,] 
B|133| M:  
A|134| B: [and] _just_ [a lot of] things [that] we're trying [to] worry [about] [, you know ,] protecting these [people] [from] _, we just_ [don't] protect [them] . 
B|135| M: [so] . h 
A|136| B: [i] [know [,] and] [i think] [, i think] [that's] ridiculous .
