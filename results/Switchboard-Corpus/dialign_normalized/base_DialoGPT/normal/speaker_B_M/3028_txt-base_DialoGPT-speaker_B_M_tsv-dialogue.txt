A|6| B: _but_ _uh_ _i think_ _that_ as far as quality _of food_ goes [the] _some_ _of_ _the most_ _expensive_ places i've _been_ had [the] [the] [really] [the] [the] worst quality _of food ._ 
B|7| M: _i like_ _to eat_ _at_ [the most] _and eat_ _a lot [of_ food .] 
A|8| B: [really] . [um] [a lot of] places _that_ even [don't] _look_ [don't] _look_ [like] much . 
B|9| M: _i'm_ _sure_ [i] _can_ _find_ [some] 
A|10| B: [some] [of] [the] [some] [of] _the best_ [food] _i have_ ever had _was_ _out_ [of] [a] outside _or_ inside [of] [a] place _that_ _we_ drove up [and] _i was_ [like] [i'm not] eating _in_ there _are you_ nuts ?

A|14| B: [i'm] _serious_ . 
B|15| M: [you] [serious] ? 
A|16| B: [um] [a lot of] _uh_ one place _that_ _we_ went [just] recently _uh_ _was_ [to] atchafalaya . 
B|17| M: she nods . 
A|18| B: _no_ _that's_ [not] _right _._ that's_ [not] _right _._ that's_ [not] _right ._ 
B|19| M: _is_ [that] [right] ? 
A|20| B: someone _in the_ _what's the_ name [of] [that] _restaurant_ ? _in the_ background _where_ [at] ? . someone _in the_ background [the] hari krishna . _in the_ background relies _oh ._ kalachandji's . kalachandji's . _it's_ _all_ vegetarian [and] _it_ _it_ _was just_ fabulous [. i] mean my husband _was_ aghast because [i] ate turnip greens [and] liked _it ._ 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: [um] kalachandji's . _it's_ _uh_ _it's_ [a] hari krishna run _restaurant ._ 
B|23| M: [i'm] aghas aghaf .

B|31| M: [i] _can't_ tell _if_ _you're talking about_ me [or] [the] guy . 
A|32| B: [that] should _get_ [you] close enough [to] [to] _be_ able [to] _find it [._ _i] think it's_ _uh_ probably listed _in the_ restaurants _you _know_ ._ 
B|33| M: _yeah [i_ have] [to] _go to a_ [restaurant .] _i'm not sure_ [where] [i] _can_ [find it .] 
A|34| B: _but_ _it's_ _uh_ _it's_ [just] fabulous [food .] 
B|35| M: _you're_ [the best] . 
A|36| B: _well_ _we like_ arby's . as far as _fast food_ goes . 
B|37| M: _you can't really get_ [it] _if_ [you] [have] [no] [fast food] 
A|38| B: [oh] [really] ? _why_ ? 
B|39| M: [you] _don't have_ _to like_ [it .] 
A|40| B: [oh] [no] [no] _no ._ someone has _been_ lying [to] [you] . _what_ _they_ use [is] roast _beef_ . 
B|41| M: [but] [why] do [they] make meat 
A|42| B: [that's] _what_ [oh] my goodness . 
B|43| M: roasted [beef] ? 
A|44| B: [i'm] surprised . my dad worked [for] arby's [for] several years . 
B|45| M: [so] [uh] [what] [are you] _going to_ do _when_ _you're_ done ? 
A|46| B: _yeah ._ 
B|47| M: _he_ chuckles . 
A|48| B: _well_ [that's] happened before .

A|50| B: [but] _we like_ good [uh] we're _we like_ mexican [food .] 
B|51| M: _i like_ [it] [but] _i'm not sure_ [why] . 
A|52| B: [and] stuff [like] _that ._ [and] [so] [um] 
B|53| M: [oh] [uh] [yeah .] 
A|54| B: [a] health [food ?] 
B|55| M: [we like] _eat_ [uh] [food .]

A|58| B: [i'm not sure] [what] [you're talking _about] ._ 
B|59| M: [are you] [talking about] _the food_ [or] _the [food_ ?] 
A|60| B: huh . 
B|61| M: _they're_ called'rood 
A|62| B: [i don't] [guess] i've ever [been] [to] anything [like] [that] _so i_ [really] [don't have] anything [to] compare [it] [to] . 
B|63| M: [no .] [why] [is] [it] ? 
A|64| B: [it] _would be_ good _i think_ 
B|65| M: [i think] [they] [would [be] .] 
A|66| B: [uh] [i don't know] [how] _expensive_ [they] [are] . [it] sounds [like] [that] [it] [would] probably 
B|67| M: hmm [i] wonder _if_ _they're_ [expensive] . 
A|68| B: [for] one person ? 
B|69| M: [i don't] [think [so] i] got [a] deal 
A|70| B: [oh] 
B|71| M: [a lot of] people [have] [a] small family . 
A|72| B: [a] bit 
B|73| M: [how] [about] [you] ? 
A|74| B: [yeah i] [i] won't [really] _be interested_ _in_ [going to] _in_ [going] there . because [i] feel [like] [i'm] [i'm] paying _you know_ five dollars [for [the] food] probably [and] five dollars [for] something _that _i_ could_ [get] along quite _well_ _without_ 
B|75| M: [you] [could] [uh] [not] [be interested] . 
A|76| B: [yeah .] _maybe_ _maybe_ _that ._ [yeah .] 
B|77| M: i'll show _them ._ 
A|78| B: [yeah [.] _i] could_ see [that] then _maybe_ . 
B|79| M: [maybe] [i could] 
A|80| B: [yeah [i] like] [the] [the] seafood [that] [they] [when] [they] had [it] _you know_ [the] broiled 
B|81| M: [you know] [i think it's] pretty cool . 
A|82| B: [yeah .] probably [that's] true . [but] _i know_ [a lot of] their [a lot of] their specials sometimes [are] fried things [that] [you can't really get] away from [the] fried 
B|83| M: [well] 
A|84| B: now [why] [would] [you] [go to a] seafood [restaurant] [to eat] _chicken_ ? 
B|85| M: [i know] 
A|86| B: [that's] one [of] my husband's pet peeves . [he] doesn't understand [why] somebody [would] [go to a] seafood place [and eat] either _chicken_ [or] steak [you [know] .] 
B|87| M: fish [and] chips . 
A|88| B: [oh] [really] ? 
B|89| M: [no] [they] [don't] . 
A|90| B: [oh] catfish [is] wonderful . 
B|91| M: [the] north . 
A|92| B: [oh] [really] . 
B|93| M: _they're_ [all] amazing . 
A|94| B: [really] . 
B|95| M: [really] [really] 
A|96| B: [why] ? 
B|97| M: i'll [be] here . 
A|98| B: [oh .] huh . 
B|99| M: _there's_ [a lot of] water _in the ocean_ . 
A|100| B: [that's] too bad because [i'm] probably [not] [going to] stop eating [it] 
B|101| M: [i have] [been] told [that i] _can_ [eat] [it] [without] [a] problem . 
A|102| B: uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|103| M: [i like] [chicken] . 
A|104| B: [that's] true . 
B|105| M: [i don't know] [i don't] [like] being _on the_ [look] [out] [for] people [i'm] worried [about .] 
A|106| B: [oh] [on] one hand [i] see [that] [and] [on the] other hand [uh] my older sister remembers [when] [uh] [at] one point [they] _were_ taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [i guess] had [a] half-life [of] [oh] five years [if] [they] sit empty [on] dry land . 
B|107| M: [yeah] [that's] [why] [i'm] confused . 
A|108| B: [so] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
B|109| M: [well] [it's] [not] [really] [a] nuclear weapon _so there's_ [that .] 
A|110| B: [and] then [they] take these things [that] will rust [and] [they] throw [them] [in the ocean] which [is] [going to] speedup [the] process even more . 
B|111| M: uhhh [they] 
A|112| B: [oh .] [and] then [they] wouldn't [think] . [they] _were_ floating around [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them .] 
B|113| M: [i think] [that's] [how] [they] got [the] radiation . 
A|114| B: [and] this [is] before _i was_ _born_ . 
B|115| M: [you] [were] [born] [in] 1988 . 
A|116| B: [so i] mean we're taking thirty years ago this happened 
B|117| M: [yes .] [we] did . 
A|118| B: [and] [and] who's [you know] [the] tuna [is] radioactive [to a] certain extent . 
B|119| M: [oh] [i know] [i [was] just] wondering . 
A|120| B: [you can't] [get] away from [it] [so [i] think] [to] [some] point 
B|121| M: [but] [what's the] label [on the] label ? 
A|122| B: [yeah] [you [know] .] [so there's] [you know] [there's] [some] things [i think] [we] [can] [we] [you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] health purposes [and] [some] things [that] [we] [just] need [to like] [you know] this [is] [not] [in] my control . 
B|123| M: [yeah] [that's] [why] [i] said [it .] 
A|124| B: [so i'm] either [going to] [be] [i'm] either [going to] starve [to] death [or] [i'm] [going to] [get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and eat] as healthily as [i] possibly [can] [you [know] .] 
B|125| M: [i don't] [think so .]
