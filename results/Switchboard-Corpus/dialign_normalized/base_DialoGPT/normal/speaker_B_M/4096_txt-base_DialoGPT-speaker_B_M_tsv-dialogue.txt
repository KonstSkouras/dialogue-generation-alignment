B|1| M: uhhh _did_ _you_ go _to _the_ e_ o ? 
A|2| B: _uh i didn't think that_ _was a_ _new_ revelation . 
B|3| M: uhhh [uh i didn't think that] _the_ epub [was a] thing yet .

A|6| B: uh-huh . 
B|7| M: [the e p a] [is] [a] pretty [new] proposal . 
A|8| B: _yeah ._ 
B|9| M:  ... 
A|10| B: right . that's [a] that's [a] common _problem_ though . [that] _it_ seems [that] has happened in dallas as well as [new] york and [i] try [to] _recycle_ all of [the] newspapers [that] come [to] my house and after [a] while [i] [just] quit taking [the] newspaper because [i] couldn't _recycle_ _it_ anymore which isn't _good_ for business on [the] other end either [i] suppose . 
B|11| M:  . 
A|12| B: uh-huh . 
B|13| M: this [is] [it] 
A|14| B: right . 
B|15| M: [i] don't 
A|16| B: well that's _good_ . 
B|17| M: i've had [a] few people have said [that] _they're_ not buying _it ._ 
A|18| B: right . there has [to] be [uh] [a] reuse for [it _.] i mean_ that's why _they_ _recycle_ . [the] one [i] [think] [is] [the] most interesting [is] with [the] recycled bottles and all [that] [uh] [the] industry seems [to] be doing with [the] recycled polymers . [uh] everything from [uh] waste baskets [to] carpet [to the] no stick _i mean_ [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
B|19| M:  
A|20| B: and [uh i] [think] _they are_ _even_ putting [it] in [the] roadways these days and [they're] making clothes now [that] _are_ recycled . like [the] recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like _that ._ 
B|21| M: [they are] recy [recycle] 
A|22| B: uh-huh . 
B|23| M:  ? 
A|24| B: oh really . 
B|25| M: n 
A|26| B: right . 
B|27| M: [i] [was] [just] joking 
A|28| B: huh . 
B|29| M: solar panels can't [even] do [that .] 
A|30| B: well _it's_ _carbon_ so [that] makes sense like [a] _carbon_ fuel of some sort _but_ what what about _emissions_ ? 
B|31| M: [but] ... [carbon] dioxide [emissions] [are] only [a] [problem] if _you_ [are] burning [it .] 
A|32| B: oh . 
B|33| M: [i] know [that [.] i mean] [it's] [just] paper . 
A|34| B: okay 
B|35| M: i'll burn [it .] 
A|36| B: no . well [it's] interesting [. i] bet [that] [was _a] good_ day at [the] _yeah_ conference then . 
B|37| M: [yeah .] she's [a good] cook 
A|38| B: [did] [it] change anything for [you] ? 
B|39| M: [i] [was] [just] wondering
