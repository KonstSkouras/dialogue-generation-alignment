A|60| B: yeah , yeah . 
B|61| M: [but] [that's] [like a] month's [salary] . 
A|62| B: yeah our biggest way [of] saving _money_ is then [to] stop all these deductions , um [, you] [know] , is [to] , let's [see] , now [, i] forget which way [we do [it] .] [we] [don't] list all [the] deductions _and_ then [we] get [more] _money_ back [, you] [know] , at [the] end [of] [the] year , 
B|63| M: umm [, no .]

B|65| M: [you] [can] use [the money] [you] [save] 
A|66| B: [that's] [what] my husband said , [so] this last year he changed [it] , [of] course , [we] didn't get hardly _and_ then nearly as [much] back _and_ [it] was [like] [oh [,] no .] better find another way [of] saving [money]
