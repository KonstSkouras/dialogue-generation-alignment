B|39| M:  
A|40| B: yes [uh] maybe you'll play around some _and_ figure _out_ [how] they can help [you] [do] [different] things . [i] think [that's] when [you] [you] start deciding [that] [you] [really] need greater assets than [you] already [have] . when [you] start seeing [what] all they can [do] [for] _you ._ 
B|41| M: [what] 
A|42| B: [well] [i] understand [that] [you] [know] . if needs _and_ wants were [the same] i'd [have] [a] four eighty-six [machine] at home 
B|43| M: [you .] 
A|44| B: _right_ . 
B|45| M: [i was] thinking _of the_ future . 
A|46| B: [uh] [that's] came _out_ around [the] first [of the] year . 
B|47| M: [i'm] pretty [sure] [the] original [was] released [in] 2003 [and] [the] original [version] [was] released [just _a] few_ months after . 
A|48| B: [it] does [a few] more things [uh] than had [been] available before . 
B|49| M: yeah [but] [it's] [been] [out] [for] [a] while now . 
A|50| B: [but] [i'm not sure] [that it's] such [a] massive improvement . [uh] [you] [know] once [you get] passed thirty-three megahertz all help [is] kind [of] lost [in the] [in the] translation . because [you] no longer can think [that] fast anyway . 
B|51| M: i'ma 
A|52| B: [well] okay . [i] enjoyed our discussion . 
B|53| M: [you're] [right] [i was] [just] thinking [of it] [in] [a] [different] [way] .
