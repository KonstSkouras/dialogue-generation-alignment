B|13| M: _well _that's_ not_ [what] [i] meant . 
A|14| B: [right .] _well that's good ._ um _how many_ children [do _you] have_ ? 
B|15| M: [right] [so] _it's_ _important_ _to_ me . 
A|16| B: two ? 
B|17| M: [yes] _they_ [do] . 
A|18| B: [i] _have_ two _daughters_ . 
B|19| M: [how many] [daughters] [do you] own ? 
A|20| B: my oldest _is_ _uh_ four _and_ my youngest _is_ about [to] turn three . two girls . _and_ [they] _are_ _a handful_ 
B|21| M: [uh] _oh_ . 
A|22| B: [yes] . we've my [uh] [well] when _we_ first got married my wife worked for _a_ year . then _we_ decided [to] _have kids ._ 
B|23| M: [well] _they're_ [a handful] . 
A|24| B: _and_ [uh] _she_ _she_ got pregnant _and_ then _we_ decided _she_ would stay _home_ with _the kids ._ _we_ would make _that_ sacrifice . _it_ _is_ [a] financial sacrifice [to] make _because_ _we_ go from two incomes down [to] _one_ . 
B|25| M: [i] love [it] ! 
A|26| B: _and_ [uh] _we_ made _that_ decision _and_ [uh] [so] after _she_ had _the_ first baby _she_ stayed _home ._ _and_ _and_ _we_ had [a] second baby _and_ she's still _at home_ 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: _and_ [so] [uh] _you know_ _at_ _work_ [a] lot _of people_ _are_ _you know_ [i] think [well] _this_ _is_ _not a_ normal situation [anymore] _in_ our _in_ our _world_ _we_ live _in_ . most [of] them [uh] continue [to] _work_ _if_ [they] _have_ _have kids ._ 
B|29| M: [i] 
A|30| B: [i] only _have_ _one_ other _person_ [i] _know_ _in_ my _in_ my group here _that_ _works_ where _the_ wife stays _home_ _and_ [that's] _because_ [of] religious values as [well] . [they're] baptists _and_ [they] _and_ [they] think [that's] [important] . 
B|31| M:  ... 
A|32| B: [but] everybody else _works_ _and_ [they] drop their _kids_ off _at_ day-care _and_ _and_ leave them _and_ _i don't know_ [i] just _don't_ [want] [i] just _don't_ [want] strangers raising my children . 
B|33| M:  ... 
A|34| B: [right .] 
B|35| M: [so] [is] [the] 
A|36| B: [that's] [how] [it] [is] _at_ our house when [you're] on [the] phone . [oh] [it's] open anything goes when mom's on [the] phone 
B|37| M: [is] [this] 
A|38| B: uh-huh . 
B|39| M: ohhaha _. so_ [you] ... 
A|40| B: [right .] 
B|41| M: i'm [the] kid's [home .] 
A|42| B: [right .] 
B|43| M: [right .] 
A|44| B: [right .] 
B|45| M: [i] read [the] books _in the_ morning . 
A|46| B: with all [the] yard _work_ _and_ things _like_ _that_ . 
B|47| M: [i] wonder [how many] hours [a] _day_ he spends _in the_ office . 
A|48| B: uh-huh . 
B|49| M:  ... [i] ... i'm [not] sure 
A|50| B: uh-huh _. right_ _we_ feel _that _you_ know_ just spending _time_ together . [you] _don't_ necessarily _have_ [to] be doing anything _you know_ _that_ costs money or or _you know_ _that_ requires [you] [to] go [a] great distance or anything _like_ _that_ . [it's] just _the kids_ _like_ [to] being together as _a family ._ 
B|51| M:  ... 
A|52| B: _like_ last saturday _we_ went had some errands [to] run _and_ [so] _we_ took _the kids_ _and_ _and_ went by [the] farmers market down [in] [in] down _there_ [in] garland . 
B|53| M: [we] 
A|54| B: _and_ [they] had [a] blast running around [the] farmers market looking _at_ all [the] _you know_ [the] food _and_ tasting all [the] free samples [they] were giving out . _and_ [they] had [a] little pen _there_ with animals [in] [they] could pet _you know_ 
B|55| M:  ... 
A|56| B: _and_ [they] liked _that_ . _and_ then on [the] way [home] [we] drove by [the] local high school _and_ _there_ happened [to] be _an_ f [a] f [a] [a] future f [a] future farmers [of] america f f [a] going on _there_ 
B|57| M: [i] 
A|58| B: _and_ [they] had all kinds [of] pigs _and_ horses _and_ goats _and_ sheep _and_ everything _you know_ all out [in] [this] [in the] [in] [this] schoolyard _there_ [. so] [we] just said hey let's stop _and_ _and _the_ kids_ got [to] go around _and_ _you know_ _see_ pigs _and_ animals _and_ things _like_ _that_ 
B|59| M: [there] 
A|60| B: _and_ _and_ for them [that's] wonderful _you _know_ ._ [they] [they] thought [it] was [the] greatest fun _you know_ _and_ [it] didn't cost any money . _and_ [uh] [you] _don't have_ quite as much money when when [the] wife _doesn't_ _work_ . 
B|61| M: [we] 
A|62| B: [right .] 
B|63| M:  ... 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: _it's not_ . 
A|66| B: [right _.] right ._ [oh] definitely motherhood [is] devalued [in] [this] society . _if_ [you're] stay _at home_ _and_ [you're] [a] mother [it's] _like_ [what] [a] waste . _people_ think _you know_ [you] should be fulfilling yourself 
B|67| M: [i don't] i'm [a] woman . 
A|68| B: _and_ _and_ [a] mother isn't _an important important_ thing as as having [a] career 
B|69| M: _because _you know_ you're_ [an important important] [person] . 
A|70| B: _and_ _and_ _that_ should be first _and_ _and_ children second . [but] [they] _don't have_ kind [of] [an] [what] [we] call _an _internal_ perspective_ [of] things . 
B|71| M: [you] mean [like] _if [you_ _have] a_ _child_ [you have] [an internal] [internal perspective] ? 
A|72| B: [but] _that_ 
B|73| M: [and the] [and] 
A|74| B: _no . right ._ 
B|75| M: [no . right .] 
A|76| B: [uh] _at_ [this] point . 
B|77| M: [well] [i] [uh] [i don't [know] .] 
A|78| B: [it's not] [to] say _that_ some [day] [you] won't go back [to] _work_ . my mother's [a] school teacher [and] when when [we] started [uh] having _kids_ _she_ had [to] _work_ for [a] little while [but] then _she_ just started substituting . 
B|79| M: [yeah] [that's] [what] [i] meant . 
A|80| B: [so] _she_ would just substitute once or twice [a] week [you know] just for _that_ little extra money when [we] were [in] school . then [we] would just come [home] [and] just be [you know] go [to] [a] neighbor's house for [an] hour then she'd be [home .] [but] _she_ wouldn't [do] _that_ _every day_ . 
B|81| M: [every day] 
A|82| B: [but] now _that_ my my [uh] youngest sister's _at_ b y u now [and] [so] [they] [have] [no] _one_ _at home_ she's back teaching school _full_ _time_ now again [. so] [if [you] know] [it's not] [it's] just [a] temporary thing . 
B|83| M: n . 
A|84| B: uh-huh . 
B|85| M: [what] ? 
A|86| B: [yeah] . 
B|87| M: [i] [see] [well that's good .] 
A|88| B: [yeah] [yeah] [you] [it's] [it's] hard sometimes _at_ _work_ [because you know] _people_ say [oh] we're taking [a] cruise we're going here we're going [there] [you know] [because] [they] [have a] lot more money . 
B|89| M: [well] [you know] i'm [not a] crazy [person] . 
A|90| B: [and] [a] lot [of] them decide just [not] [to] [have] children . 
B|91| M: [the] [world] [is] [full] [of people] who [don't [have] kids .] 
A|92| B: [it's] [it's] amazing [they] either [have] _one_ or none . 
B|93| M: [the kids .] 
A|94| B: [and] [and _the] one_ [person] [i] [know] _that_ has _one_ [they] [they] feel guilty . _she_ has [this] continual guilt trip _that_ she's [not] doing [the] [right] thing [and] [so] on [uh] on weekends _she_ would [you know] spend all [of] her _time_ with her [kids] [and] spend lots [of] lots [and] lots [of] money . basically [i] think [they] [they] really spoil [the] [child] [to] try [to] overcompensate for their guilt feelings . 
B|95| M: lol 
A|96| B: [and] [and] [and] [they] [don't] _want to_ [have] [anymore] children [because] [they] just [don't] think [you know] _that_ _she doesn't_ think _she_ could be [a] mother _at home ._ [that's not] her bag [. so] _she_ just _doesn't_ think _that_ _she_ could [you know] [the] guilt feelings _she_ can't deal with with [it] [anymore] 
B|97| M: [this] [to] 
A|98| B: [so] 
B|99| M: [that you] [you] ? 
A|100| B: [you know] 
B|101| M: [i don't] [she doesn't] [want to] . 
A|102| B: uh-huh . [yeah] my wife [uh] likes staying [home .] 
B|103| M: [well] [i] mean [you] [are] [the one] who's [the one] [right] ? 
A|104| B: [uh] _she works_ _at home_ some though . 
B|105| M: [i] _work [at home_ .] 
A|106| B: [the] place _she works_ with worked with before um worked out [an] arrangement with her where [she] can [work at home] _part time_ 
B|107| M: uhh [she works] [in] [a] restaurant [part time] _part _of_ [a_ family .] 
A|108| B: [and] [so] [uh] [that] [it's] kind [of a] seasonal thing . three times [a] year she's really busy doing certain things based on [that] kind [of] business 
B|109| M: [that's good .] 
A|110| B: [but] [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . [she] likes [to] sew [and] [do] crafts [and] things [like] [that] [so] [she] enjoys staying [at home] [but] [uh] [the] money [part of] [it] [is] [not] as rewarding obviously [but] there's _different_ rewards [you know] _different_ kinds [of] rewards . 
B|111| M: [different] 
A|112| B: [right] [right] [right .] [and] [you] really [have] [to] make [uh] quite [a] bit [of] money . [the] wife [doesn't] make [it] worth [it] with [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|113| M: [i] 
A|114| B: [i] [know] there's [you know] when [you] adjust your income for [what] [you] put out for day-care [you know you're] only making [like] five .
