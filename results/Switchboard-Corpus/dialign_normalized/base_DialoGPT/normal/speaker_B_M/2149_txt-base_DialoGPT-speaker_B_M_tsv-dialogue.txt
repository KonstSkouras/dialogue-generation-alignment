A|66| B: [yeah . and] _it's not_ , _you know ,_ [we] _don't_ promote [it] _a lot_ outside [the] community because [we] _don't_ _want_ recognition [for] [it] , _you know_ [so] much as , [we] [just] _want to_ help _people_ out . 
B|67| M: _i don't_ [get] _it ._

A|94| B: [yeah [.] _i] don't think_ [that ,] some [people] _i don't think_ [have] [, uh [,] _a] year_ [in] them [to] volunteer if _you know_ _what [i_ [mean] .] they're [not] worth [it] 
B|95| M: [i'm] [not sure] . maybe [it's] [just] [a year] [or] two _in the_ academy .

B|107| M: [what] ? 
A|108| B: [just] , pick up [and] head [on] out . 
B|109| M: [i mean , i'm] [not sure] [what _i] could do_ . 
A|110| B: [i] wish [i could do] something [like that _,] but i_ [can't] [, so] 
B|111| M: [yeah [,] but] [it's not a] problem 
A|112| B: [right] [, that's] [the] [way] [i am] [. i know] [the] [feeling] .
