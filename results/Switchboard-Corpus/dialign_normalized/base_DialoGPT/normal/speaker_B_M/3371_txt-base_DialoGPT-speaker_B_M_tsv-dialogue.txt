A|28| B: [you] _know_ [what i] miss though ? basements . 
B|29| M: he shrugs [. i've] _been_ lucky . 
A|30| B: [i] [i] sure wish [they] _could_ build basements [in] homes [in] texas . 
B|31| M: _it's_ [a] shame [they] didn't [have] any .

B|47| M: [the] only thing [i] [can] think [of] [is] [the] 
A|48| B: [you] 
B|49| M: [you] [are] correct . 
A|50| B: right . _some people_ [i] [mean] families seem [to] migrate towards one one room [and] carry [on] most [of] their activities there [and] [uh] [uh] _some_ rooms [we] [have] one room [that] [we] never use . 
B|51| M: [some people] [we call] [it] [a] [family] . 
A|52| B: [i] [mean] might as _well_ [not] _even_ heat [and] _cool_ [it .] 
B|53| M: [we] arent [even] going [to get] [to] [that] . 
A|54| B: strange .

B|63| M: [how long have] [we] [been in] [this area] ? 
A|64| B: we've [been] fifteen fifteen _years_ [in the] [in the] [house] [that] [we're] living [in] . 
B|65| M: [you've [been] [in] the] neighborhood for eighteen [years] ? 
A|66| B: [and] [we] [the] [the] principal feature [i] like [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
B|67| M: [what] [about the] tower ? 
A|68| B: yours [is _a] slab_ [i] assume . 
B|69| M: [well] [it's] _a slab ._ 
A|70| B: yeah ours [is a] pier [and] beam which [has] allowed me [to] go under [it] [and] [do] [a whole] [lot of] different things [that] [i could] [not] [have] done [if] [it] was [slab .] 
B|71| M: [is it] [slab] ? 
A|72| B: [i've] done [a lot of] electrical [and] plumbing [and] other work [that] by myself [and] saved [a lot of] money [that] [i] couldn't [have] done [if] [the] [house] was [on] [a slab .] 
B|73| M: [do you have] any experience [with] [slab] building ?

B|75| M: _my_ [house] [is] [slab .] 
A|76| B: [it's] thirty-five thirty-six [years] old [when] [they] used [to] build like [that] [and] [uh] 
B|77| M: [that's] [pretty] [cool] . 
A|78| B: [i] [know] he's [not] [a] handy right ? 
B|79| M: [that's] [not] [how] [that] works 
A|80| B: [i] [on] [the] other hand [uh] [do] [a lot] [too] much [of] [it] 
B|81| M: [i] [have [a] lot of] problems [with it .] 
A|82| B: [and] [uh] [i've] gotten _good at_ [it] which [in] [a] [in] [a] way [is] bad because then [you] [uh] [you] start [to] take pleasure [in it]
