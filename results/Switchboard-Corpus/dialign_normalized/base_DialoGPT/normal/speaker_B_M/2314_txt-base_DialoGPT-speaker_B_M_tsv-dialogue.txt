A|24| B: _right ._ _well_ _do you think_ [that] _should be_ implemented _in the_ work place . [you] _know_ as like [a] manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion [that] someone [is] using _drugs_ _do you think_ _they_ _should_ _have_ [the] _right_ _to send_ _them_ [to] _be tested ._ 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: _right ._ 
B|27| M: [i think] [it] [should be] possible [to send] [people] who use [drugs] [to] test [them] 
A|28| B: _right ._ 
B|29| M: [right .] 
A|30| B: [right] [right _.] yeah_ [it] [it] _would_ almost [be] like [a] [a] _uh ..._ 
B|31| M: [they] [would] [be] mad [at] [you] [if you] [did] . 
A|32| B: uh-huh . _and_ then _how would you_ feel afterwards when [you] came _up_ negative _and_ [you] _know_ your supervisor has accused [you] [of] using [drugs] . 
B|33| M: [how would you] react 
A|34| B: [right .] [i] agree with [that] . [because] [i] _know_ personally myself _i've_ been _in the_ same _job_ [for] three years [it] will [be] three years _in_ august _and_ _i've_ already been [drug] _tested_ three times . 
B|35| M: [i] 
A|36| B: _well_ _i'm_ an environmental engineer 
B|37| M: [what] ? 
A|38| B: _and_ _i've_ been [drug] _tested_ three times _and_ [i] _know_ many [people] [that] _have_ _never_ been _tested_ _in_ their lifetime _and_ [the] _company_ [i] work [for] [is] sixty thousand [people] plus . so see [i] [for] some reason _i've_ come _up_ three times . _that's_ pretty _high_ statistics . 
B|39| M: [high] ? _no ._ 
A|40| B: [no .] [no] [not] [at] all . 
B|41| M: [do you think] [that's] [how] [it] works ? 
A|42| B: [it's a] legal _job_ [you] _know_ 
B|43| M: [i'm] [not] sure [what] [i'm] [doing] . 
A|44| B: so see [it's] really strange . 
B|45| M: [i don't [know] .] 
A|46| B: oh uh-huh .
