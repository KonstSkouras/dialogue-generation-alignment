B|3| M: i've been playing [in the] mesothelioma . 
A|4| B: [uh] both 
B|5| M: _do_ _we _have_ a_ team ?

A|48| B: _right_ . [yeah] [i] know _what_ [you mean]

[they] last for [a] long time then . [so] if [you] start putting them [you] know [you can] put them [out in the] spring too [but] once [it] starts getting real hot then [it] just kills them cause [they] can't stand [the] hot weather . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| B: [no] [they] won't make [it] through [the] summer [because] [it] gets too hot [but] [they] make [it] through [probably] winter [and] spring . [so]
