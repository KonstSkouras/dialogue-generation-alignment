A|14| B: yeah . 
B|15| M: _i think_ _you_ are talking _about_ _the_ military . 
A|16| B: yeah . definitely [i think] _that_ _there's_ _probably_ [a] lot [of] _waste_ _in_ defense and _in_ government funded research _in_ [the] first place . 
B|17| M: [i] _know_ . _that's_ why [i] said _it_ . 
A|18| B: [i] mean there was um people at stanford who were soaking [the] government _you know_ using _millions_ [of] dollars [of] research _money_ _to_ [uh] _for_ [the] president _to_ buy beach homes or whatever [it] was . 
B|19| M: [there's] no such thing as [a] [waste] [of] [money] .

A|30| B: well [that's] [right _.] uh_ [i think] [that] _oh_ _politicians_ _talk_ [a] lot _about waste_ 
B|31| M: because [uh] [politicians] don't [talk] [about waste] . 
A|32| B: [but] [i'm not] sure [that] [that's] _really_ [that] much [of the] problem . 
B|33| M: uuhh [. uh] [it's] [not] [like] they are doing anything . 
A|34| B: [i] mean when [you] look at [something] [like] [the] gulf war [it] cost us god knows how much . [you know] at [a] million dollars [a] pop [for] patriot missiles . 
B|35| M: because [it] costs taxpayers [millions] [in] military spending . 
A|36| B: yeah . 
B|37| M: [but] [the] usa never did
