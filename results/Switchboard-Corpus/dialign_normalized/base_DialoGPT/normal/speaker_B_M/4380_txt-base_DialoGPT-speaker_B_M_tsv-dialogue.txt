B|1| M: oh [and i] ? 
A|2| B: okay _uh_ i've _the_ high _school_ [i] went to was _uh_ was a good one also . [and i] _well_ [i] guess _you_ could _say_ one of _the_ problems with _the_ public education system is _the_ disparity between different schools . because _the_ one [i] went to was _you know_ _i'm_ _sure_ a a lot nicer than _you know_ a lot of _the_ inner city schools [and] _the_ things around atlanta . 
B|3| M: _yeah ._ 
A|4| B: [yeah .] 
B|5| M: [you] _are_ [you] not _in the_ [school] [you know] ? 
A|6| B: _what_ 
B|7| M: [well] 
A|8| B: [yeah] _that's_ true . 
B|9| M: [and] 
A|10| B: [yeah .] [and] _i'm_ also _i mean_ [in the] [in] those places where _uh_ _like_ [the] economy is _really_ bad _they_ might [you know] _be_ more tempted to to quit [school] [and] get jobs [and] that kind of thing because _they_ need [the] [you know] money to put food on [the] table [and] stuff _like_ that . more than _they_ _would_ [you know] [in] areas where _they_ 
B|11| M: _i think_ [that's] _it_ . 
A|12| B: uh-huh . [yeah .] [that's] true . 
B|13| M: your words 
A|14| B: right . 
B|15| M: [i] don't 
A|16| B: [yeah .] 
B|17| M: [what] ? 
A|18| B: [that's] hard for me to _say_ since [i] didn't [i] didn't _really_ grow [well] when [i] went to elementary [school] [it] [it] wasn't [in] a great area _but_ [i] still _i mean i_ learned to read started learning to read when [i] was [in] kindergarten [you know] . 
B|19| M: _no_ [it] . 
A|20| B: so [i] guess [i] can't _really_ [i] can't _say what_ [it] _would be_ _like_ to _uh_ grow _up in_ a _really_ oppressed region 
B|21| M: it's not [like] [you] can [say what] [you] [would be] _if you_ grew [up [in] the] country . 
A|22| B: [you know] [i] guess [the] whole [the] whole environment [and] attitude towards [school] [and] learning is different for [the] people . 
B|23| M: [i mean i] [know] i'd [be] 
A|24| B: so [i] guess [the] problem is [the] [the] thing to do is to try to _uh_ to get some kind of motivation to learn [and] 
B|25| M: [i'm] not [sure] _i think_ 
A|26| B: uh-huh . [yeah .] uh-huh . 
B|27| M: [i] . 
A|28| B: [no] [i] [i] can't [say] that [i] have either . _but_ _uh_ 
B|29| M: [i] don't [but] 
A|30| B: [yeah .] i've i've heard some [i mean] i've heard statistics [and] things that that _compare_ a public education to a _private_ education . [i mean] within [like] within [the] same _uh_ income groups . 
B|31| M: nope .. [uh] . 
A|32| B: [if you] _compare_ [the] [like] [the] people that could have that could have sent their kids to _private_ schools [and] [the] people that [you know] [the] people that [uh] did send their kids to _private_ schools . 
B|33| M: [private] [school] . 
A|34| B: [i think] _they_ _compare [you_ know] fairly [well] . 
B|35| M: not [really] [they] don't [compare you] [in] any way . 
A|36| B: [yeah .] [i] [i] [i] my schools [i mean] there [i] have a lot of once once [it] seemed [i] got into high [school] [they] had a lot of [uh] accelerated programs [and] all kinds of stuff [like] that . 
B|37| M: ya ' 
A|38| B: that [i mean] that makes a big difference cause [i] wondered when they're taking classes with [uh] with people that [are] [really] [are] interested [in the] [the] subject [and] stuff [like] that . 
B|39| M: [i'm] sorry .
