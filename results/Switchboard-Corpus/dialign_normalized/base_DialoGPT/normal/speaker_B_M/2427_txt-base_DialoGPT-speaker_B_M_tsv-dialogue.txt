B|7| M: _i know_ _right . i_ _like to_ _fiddle_ _around_ [in] _my garage_ . 
A|8| B: _and_ especially _when_ _the_ weather's [not] _too_ hot or , [not] raining or whatever , 
B|9| M: [it's] _good_ 
A|10| B: _but , uh ,_ sometimes _i , i_ said _, i_ sometimes [i] wish [i] _had_ _more_ space _you _know_ ._ 
B|11| M: _well [,_ it's] [the] _only_ way . 
A|12| B: [i] _grow_ [a lot of] things , [a lot of] food . 
B|13| M: _but _, uh , you_ _don't_ _have_ to_ _say_ _that ._ 
A|14| B: _and_ sometimes _i , i_ _want to_ _plant_ _something_ , there's _not enough_ room [to] _plant_ . _some_ [of] those things [like] [, uh _, you] know , the_ things [that] vine [like] [, uh ,] _cucumbers_ , or [, uh ,] squash or _something_ , [like] [that .] _plant_ _one of_ those

B|31| M: _you know what i_ [like] ? 
A|32| B: [yeah [.] [i] _, uh ,] i guess_ [you] _can_ _get_ _an_ earlier harvest by _doing that_ , 
B|33| M: _i'll_ _be_ _the one_ _who_ grows . 
A|34| B: [but , uh ,] [sure] _is_ [a] heck [of] [a lot of] work . 
B|35| M: [i] _can't_ even _start_ [a] farm , [so] [it's] _just a_ farm 
A|36| B: _because_ [you] _got_ _to ,_ watch [them] every day _, and_ _keep_ [them] watered 
B|37| M: _why_ _would_ [you] [want _to] do_ [that] ? 
A|38| B: _and_ [i _, _i] don't_ think_ [i'll] _do it_ again 
B|39| M: _oh ._ _i'm_ sorry 
A|40| B: _oh _,_ yeah _._ _yeah ,_ i_ _enjoy [it_ [.] i] come home from work _and_ _, and_ [i] usually [say] hello [to] wife _and_ kids _, and_ _then_ _go_ out _and_ [fiddle] _, you know ,_ [just] walk [around] [the] _yard_ _and_ inspect [it] 
B|41| M: _oh [._ yeah ,] _i've_ never _been_ [to] [a] museum _before ._ 
A|42| B: _and_ [the] kids [want to] swing , 
B|43| M: [it's] [the] same [in the] uk . 
A|44| B: _and_ [i] push [them] _on_ swing . 
B|45| M: [i'll] play _with_ [your] _hand_ 
A|46| B: _and_ [i] [i] mow [my] _own_ _lawn_ . 
B|47| M: [i] _i'm_ [a] grown _up ._ 
A|48| B: _and_ [i] [do] _, i _don't have_ a_ sprinkler system [. [i] _, i] don't_ _enjoy_ watering . 
B|49| M: [i don't] , _i'm_ [not] [a] robot .

B|51| M: [we _do] ._ 
A|52| B: [oh] [how] , 
B|53| M: [we] [have a] water pump , _but it's_ [not enough] [to] power _our_ water . 
A|54| B: [oh .] 
B|55| M: [it's] _the best ._ 
A|56| B: [yeah [,] you] _can_ [have] [it] come _on_ [just] early [in the] morning _. and_ _, and_ off by _the _,_ you know ,_ by _the time_ _you're_ [up] _and_ _about_ . 
B|57| M: _i'm_ [just] kidding 
A|58| B: [yeah [.] [i] , i] usually _get it_ started _for_ [my] wife

A|60| B: _and_ [i _,] and_ she moves [it] [around] _ever_ other day . 
B|61| M: ah [, [the] ,] _of ._ 
A|62| B: uh-huh .

A|66| B: uh-huh . 
B|67| M: uhhh ... [what] ? 
A|68| B: [yeah .] sometimes [i] wish _i could_ _get_ _one of_ these [, uh ,] chemical services [to] come , out _and_ spray [for] weeds _, and_ fertilize _, and_ _all_ [that] _and_ take [that] [one] step out [of .] 
B|69| M: [i don't think] [i could] [ever] [get] [a] [lawn] _to go_ . 
A|70| B: [but , _uh ,] they_ [want] _too_ _much_ money . 
B|71| M: _i don't _know_ [, i_ don't have] [an] excuse . 
A|72| B: [yeah .] 
B|73| M: _i mean [,_ it's] [not] _expensive_ . 
A|74| B: [right .] [right .] [but it's] _still_ [be] quite _a bit_ cheaper _to do it_ yourself . 
B|75| M: [because] _of the_ chemicals . 
A|76| B: [right] _and_ [the] weed come [up] , 
B|77| M: [what] _do you_ _mean_ ? 
A|78| B: _and_ _all_ [of] [a] sudden _you've_ _got_ [to do] _something_ else . 
B|79| M: [and] _now_ _i'm_ [in] _a good_ mood 
A|80| B: [yeah .] 
B|81| M: [oh ,] [right .] 
A|82| B: [well ,] if _you _,_ enjoy it_ _too _,_ you know [,_ _you] [,_ you] _can_ [get] out [in the] morning _when_ , [before] [it] gets hot [and] _, and_ _do it_ [and] stuff _, _when_ you_ [only] [have to ,] 
B|83| M: [i ,] [too [,] enjoy it] 
A|84| B: [right .] 
B|85| M: [you're] [not] limited _, you [have_ [to] do it] 
A|86| B: _when_ [the] days [start] getting [a] little longer _, you know [,_ you] _can_ [, _i] can start_ [doing _it] [in_ the] evening after work . 
B|87| M: what's [the time] [for] ? 
A|88| B: _when they _,_ when they_ _switch_ [to _,] switch_ , 
B|89| M: [when [you] [,] [when they] [,] switch] 
A|90| B: [when] [we] [get] _an hour_ _more_ , 
B|91| M: [i can start] working [on] [it in] _an hour ._ 
A|92| B: [when they] rollback [an hour .] 
B|93| M: [when they] roll _back_ [an hour .] 
A|94| B: _i don't know ._ 
B|95| M: [when] will [the] patch [be] available ? 
A|96| B: [i] [really] _don't know ._ [it] [just] seems [like] [i] here [it] _on _the_ news_ [the] day [before .] 
B|97| M: _they're_ [still] [in [the] news] . 
A|98| B: [and] _, uh [, i_ , _i] think_ [it's] coming [up] here soon . 
B|99| M: yea [, _i] [know_ .] 
A|100| B: [yeah _.] yeah ._ 
B|101| M: [oh .] [well] [i think] [i] heard [something] [about] [it] being [on the] website . 
A|102| B: _are you_ having any trouble [with] bugs [in] , [in] [your] [garden] ? 
B|103| M: [i have] _no_ idea . 
A|104| B: uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [i don't know .] 
A|106| B: [right .] [right . [i] , i _,] it_ seems [like] [they] come [in] spurts . 
B|107| M: ugh [, it's] [not] _good_ . 
A|108| B: [one] year [i] _didn't_ put anything [on] [and] [i] _didn't_ [have] any problems . 
B|109| M: uhhh _, you're_ [not] even _on my_ list . 
A|110| B: _next_ year _i was_ planting _some_ broccoli [and] _, and_ _some_ [of] those _, they're_ called _cabbage_ , _cabbage_ loppers , or whatever . 
B|111| M: [how] _do you_ [plant] [cabbage] ? 
A|112| B: _they were_ _just covered_ [with] [them] , 
B|113| M: [how] did [they] _get that_ ? 
A|114| B: [i mean [,] i] went [up] [, i] _didn't_ [go] out there [for] [about] three days _, you know ,_ [because] [i _,] and_ [i] went out there [one] day [and] _the plant was_ nothing left [but] _a stem_ , 
B|115| M: [the] plants . 
A|116| B: [they] devoured [it] [that] quickly . 
B|117| M: [the plant _was] [just_ covered] [in] leaves [, it] [didn't] even [have [a] stem] 
A|118| B: [and] _, [they_ _,] [they_ ,] [have a] [, [you] ,] [a good] appetite 
B|119| M: [they] [have a] great sense [of] humor . 
A|120| B: _and they_ [would] _, you [know [,_ i] , i] picked off [like] twenty [of] [them] [and] , 
B|121| M: [they] _have [,_ you know , the] ,,... 
A|122| B: [yeah .] 
B|123| M: [it's] also [, _they're] just_ _as much_ [a] threat [to] [your] crops _as_ _tomatoes_ . 
A|124| B: [they] _got_ [that] [, uh _,] what_ _is_ [that] safer _soap_ [, uh ,] b t spray this , year . 
B|125| M: [the first] rule [of] being [a] tomato [is] never [to] use [soap] . 
A|126| B: [and] [i've been] watching [them] every day [and] [i've] _, and_ _i haven't_ _seen_ any _signs_ yet _. so ,_ if [i see] any _signs_ [i'm] going [to] spray [them] , 
B|127| M: [i've been] [doing that] since [the first] week [of] july . 
A|128| B: [and] [, uh ,] 
B|129| M: [i've been] seeing [signs] [for] _years_ [, and] [i'm] [not] even [in the] uk . 
A|130| B: [right .] 
B|131| M: hehehe . _no_ , 
A|132| B: [well [,] the] [good] stuff . [right .] 
B|133| M: [it's] _the best_ thing [ever] . 
A|134| B: [right [.] yeah ,] [my] backyard [is] [, uh ,] [is] sloping [so] [i] built [a] box [up] [, you know] _had_ [to] build [the one] [, the] low side [up .] 
B|135| M: [so] [what] [about] [the] wall ? 
A|136| B: [and] _, uh , i_ _had_ sandy loam hauled [in] [. i] _had_ [a] dump truck come [and] dump [it .] 
B|137| M: [well _,] that's_ [just] 
A|138| B: [on my] driveway _, i guess_ [, that's] [what] _they do_ [and] _then_ [, i] _had_ [to] wheel barrow [it in] . 
B|139| M: [i guess] [they do] [that .] 
A|140| B: [but , uh [, you] know [,] you] [can] improve _your own_ soil there 
B|141| M: [right [.] so [,] uh ,] they'll fix [it .] 
A|142| B: [but] [the] texas soil isn't [the] greatest , gardening soil . 
B|143| M: [that's] [the] worst [i've] [ever] [seen] . 
A|144| B: [right _.] and_ [you know ,] if [i , i] [didn't] [wait] five [years] [for] _it _to_ be_ [good] [enough] _grow_ [you know what [i] mean] 
B|145| M: _i [know_ ,] [but] _you have_ _no_ idea [how] [much] [it] cost [to [get] [it] _to] grow_
