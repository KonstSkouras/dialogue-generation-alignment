A|0| B: _the_ area _i work_ in _it_ _it_ primarily have maybe _a_ hundred _people_ or so . 
B|1| M: _i don't_ _think_ _that's_ [a] _small_ city . 
A|2| B: so [that's] make up most _of the_ laboratory so from from _that_ standpoint _it's_ pretty [small] _it's_ pretty [small] . 
B|3| M: [it's] mostly [the] size [of the] lab . 
A|4| B: _what_ about yourself ? 
B|5| M: [that's] _true_ . 
A|6| B: oh okay . 
B|7| M: she's [a] scientist she _can_ _do_ anything . 
A|8| B: oh okay . [i] see . 
B|9| M: i'm [a] student _and [i_ work] with [the] [people] _down_ _there_ . 
A|10| B: oh okay . right . _uh_ 
B|11| M: _i mean_ _you_ _can_ _just_ _say_ _that ._ 
A|12| B: uh-huh . right . 
B|13| M: _you're_ 
A|14| B: well those [and] probably [the] security aspect [of] _it_ . 
B|15| M: [what] _is_ important ? 
A|16| B: because [a] lot [of] time nowadays _even_ though [you're] working _uh_ [you're] treated [and] _it_ may _not_ _be_ [true] in every _place_ . in [a] lot [of] cases _i think_ [you're] treated more like [a] number instead [of] [a] [a] person . 
B|17| M: why _would_ [i] want _to_ go _to_ [a] [place] where [i] _can_ _do_ [it] ? 
A|18| B: because when [it] come [down] [to] layoff they [don't] really consider [people] [and] [and] _you know_ their well being as far as _you know_ how they going their next dollar going [to] come in . how they going [to] pay their bills . they [just] lay them off . 
B|19| M: lol ' 
A|20| B: [and i] was reading _this_ book one time about _this_ guy [that] had _uh_ _i think_ [the] _company_ still exists . [what] they use [to] [do] [is] they used [to] cut [the] number [of] hours _for_ everybody as opposed [to] [just] laying [people] off _you know_ . 
B|21| M: [i think] 
A|22| B: [that] way [that] _you know_ one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time . 
B|23| M: i'm [not] [even] 
A|24| B: [and] _uh_ _you know i think_ if they had programs [that] set up [to] subsidize [people] [that] [do] get laid off [a] little bit better _you know_ other than _you know_ something like unemployment [is] good but [i mean] [the] _company_ as [a] whole because [you] as an employee [even] [the] _company_ [is] making money they paying [you] [a] salary but [you] are responsible _for_ [that] _company_ growth . [you're] responsible also _for_ helping [that] _company_ get [to] _the point_ [that] [it's] at at making profits . so [there] should _be_ something in [there] or some kind [of] clause [that] will subsidize [people] if they did lose their job other than _you know_ _uh_ neglect or something like [that .] 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: _you know_ . because [it's] [not] [a] person's fault [that] _you know_ [people] [not] buying or businesses are are [not] on [the] up [and] up all [the] time _you know_ . [i don't] see how one or two [people] maybe more one or two but _you know_ [a] number [of] [people] [can] _can be_ [the] downfall [of] _a company_ situation . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: well in [a] sense [that] [say] how _do you_ make [a] [a] conclusion [that] [you're] going [to] lay off these ten [people] . _uh_ _for_ [the] bad times [of the] _company_ . 
B|29| M: [you] . 
A|30| B: [what] about [the] [the] [work] effort those ten [people] did when [the] _company_ was doing well . 
B|31| M: [i don't] ? 
A|32| B: _you know_ . in [that] standpoint . 
B|33| M:  ... [uh] [what] ? 
A|34| B: yes [i] _do ._ 
B|35| M: [do you] [work] [for] [a company] ? 
A|36| B: [i] really _do ._ [i think] it'd _be_ better [that] way [and] [even] at [that] [it] [would] at least give [the] person time [to] look [for] another job because they _know_ [that] [that] [there] are problems 
B|37| M: [you know] [you] [do .] 
A|38| B: [and] [you know] [there] are reason [to] look [for] another job instead [of] [just] dumping [it] on them all at one time . 
B|39| M: [you know i think] _that would_ [be] [a] great idea . 
A|40| B: [you know] . [that's] [just] [that's] my views [you know] . 
B|41| M: [i don't] [think] [you] understand [the point] [of] [this] post 
A|42| B: right . right . right . 
B|43| M:  ... 
A|44| B: well at least [that would] give [a] person [a] chance [to] look [you know] . because [the] way [it] [is] [a] person really [don't] have [a] chance 
B|45| M: [you] [can be] ?
