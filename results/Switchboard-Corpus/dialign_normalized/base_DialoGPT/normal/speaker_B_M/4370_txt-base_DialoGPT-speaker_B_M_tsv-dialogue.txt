A|0| B: _i_ can't _remember_ which . _i_ was on _a_ _jury_ trial last year only _i_ got kicked _out_ as uh _the_ last selection _that_ _the_ uh defense got . 
B|1| M: _you_ can _get_ [out] _of_ [jury] 
A|2| B: um . 
B|3| M: perem's _not_ [that] _bad_ 
A|4| B: [that] uh 
B|5| M: _i don't_ [remember] . 
A|6| B: _right_ _but_ _it_ still has _to_ _be_ _a _group_ of_ your _peers ._ 
B|7| M: [but] _it's_ _not_ [a group] _it's [a_ group] . 
A|8| B: see . 
B|9| M: _i think_ _you_ mean [the] [group of] [peers .] 
A|10| B: so if [it's] your [peers] and you're [not] educated then 
B|11| M: _i'm_ _in the_ _process_ [of] getting my education . 
A|12| B: [you] _want_ [you] _want_ [a] nincompoop [jury] because they'll sympathize _with_ [you] [a] bit as well as hopefully being honest people and _do_ their best _to_ comply _with_ [the] facts as _they_ were presented _to_ them . 
B|13| M: _i don't _know_ what_ [i] [want] _to do with_ my life . 
A|14| B: so _that's_ why [the] defense is there picking through them whereas at [the] same time [the] uh [the] prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh [a] _guilty_ verdict if [the] facts warrant . 
B|15| M: yes 
A|16| B: so uh [i _think] the_ [jury] selection [process] is pretty neat [but] [i don't] [think] [that] [the] [jury] ought [to] _be_ [the] ones picking [the] punishment afterwards . 
B|17| M: pick ? 
A|18| B: [i think] [that] _should be_ left up [to] people who have some knowledge [in the] subject and more knowledge than [a] [jury] would have . you're talking about [the] person's already been found _guilty_ _right_ 
B|19| M:  ... [guilty] . 
A|20| B: and many times i've seen on trials _they_ have on t v [the] [jury] will make [a] recommendation as [to] leniency or as [to] [the] death penalty or whatever [but] [i think] [that] _it_ _should be_ up [to] [the] judge and [the] uh lawyers [to] make [the] decision as [to] [what] [the] actual penalty will _be ._ 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: maybe just [the] judge because they're [the] people who [know what] [the] system is and [what] [it's] all about and believe [in the] system . 
B|23| M: [i] agree . 
A|24| B: uh and [i think] [that] would provide [a] more fair sentencing procedure . as opposed [to] an emotional sentencing procedure . also may _be_ [a] more consistent sentencing procedure . 
B|25| M: uhhuh 
A|26| B: well preceding criminal record according [to] [the] judicial [process] has nothing [to do with] [the] current crime . [but] when _it_ comes [to] uh sentencing for punishment [of] course if [the] person's never done anything [bad] before according [to] [the] judicial system then they're _going_ [to] lean towards [a] slightly more lenient side and [the] jury's supposed [to] _be_ notified [of] criminal records when _it_ comes [to] sentencing by [jury] . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: at least [in] california they're supposed [to] _be ._ [not] during [the] trial during [the] trial as [to] whether they're [guilty] or [not] has nothing [to do with] their background . 
B|29| M:  
A|30| B: [but] when _it_ comes [to] [what] kind [of] sentence you're _going_ [to] lay down [i think] [that] uh [that] _they should_ . 
B|31| M: _i'm_ [going] ? 
A|32| B: [i don't] [i don't know] [that] _they_ always have because [i] never sat all [the] way through [a] [jury] trial . _they_ [get] too boring . 
B|33| M: [you] [know] [that's] [a] lie [right] ? 
A|34| B: well if [it's a] second offense [the] punishment _should_ certainly _be_ more severe than [a] first offense because obviously [the] rehabilitation [process] did [not] work [the] first time . 
B|35| M: [you] 
A|36| B: so [you] got [to] give them either more time [in the] system or [a] different [process] [that] will hopefully work better . when _it_ comes down [to] things like alternative sentencing [i'm] all for [that] for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets [that] have gone [to] warrant [you] give them [the] option [of] working off their time doing civil service sort [of] things . 
B|37| M: [it] 
A|38| B: [i think] those ought [to] _be_ punished [a] whole lot worse than _they_ are . 
B|39| M: [they [should] [be] .] 
A|40| B: yeah . 
B|41| M: [do] [you] [think the] police [should] 
A|42| B: well uh say embezzlement [right] . [you] [get] [a] guy down [the] street who comes up uh carrying [a]
