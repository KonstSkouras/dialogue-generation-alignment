B|3| M: _you_ _mean_ _to_ tell _me_ _that_ _you have_ ? 
A|4| B: okay . 
B|5| M: _you have _to_ have_ some kind _of_ special relationship _with_ _me _to_ be_ an adult . 
A|6| B: _right ._ 
B|7| M: so _, and_ you're you're [right .] 
A|8| B: okay . 
B|9| M: how , _are_ . 
A|10| B: [right _.] i_ _, _i_ think_ [that] _job_ wise benefits [are] _just_ as important as salary _is_ . 
B|11| M: _but_ ... 
A|12| B: exactly , 
B|13| M: [i] don't [think] _you_ understand how _the_ [job] market works . 
A|14| B: exactly . 
B|15| M: _it's_ [not] [that] _much_ , [just] _a lot of_ _money_ . 
A|16| B: especially when [you _have] a_ family , [with] children [, and] _you are_ _always_ _going _to_ the_ _doctor_ for , 
B|17| M: _that's_ _because_ _it's_ [a] _good_ way _to get_ _your_ blood pressure _up_ . 
A|18| B: exactly , 
B|19| M: you're _a lot_ _more_ likely _to get a_ new [doctor] _if_ [you have] an _old_ one . 
A|20| B: _they_ _always_ [do .] 
B|21| M: _and it's_ [always] _good_ _to be_ home 
A|22| B: _yeah , _i_ think_ _any_ , _any_ , even [if] [your] _insurance_ policy _is_ [not] [the] greatest . 
B|23| M: [a] small business _company_ _, if_ [you] will . 
A|24| B: exactly . [you] [you] _would _not_ be_ pulling _it_ out _of your_ account _all_ _of the_ _time_ [just] by yourself . 
B|25| M: _i [would_ not] . 
A|26| B: also , for working women uh _, _i_ think_ [a lot _of] the_ companies _should_ start providing for day-care _in the_ , _in the_ , _in the_ building . 
B|27| M: [i] wouldnt _have _to_ work ,_ [just] _to pay_ _my_ _own_ rent [and] food . 
A|28| B: [right .] 
B|29| M: you're 
A|30| B: _yeah_ . _like_ _in_ may case _, _i_ have_ three children *spelling: 'may' _should_ [be] 'my' from ages nine [to] two . [and] , [it's] [just] unfeasible for [me to] try [to _get a] job_ [because] _all_ [the] [money] [that] [i would] , [be] making _would be_ _going to_ _day_ _care ._ 
B|31| M: [i] ' 
A|32| B: [and] _it_ _would be_ [just] , 
B|33| M: [the] world [would be] [a] _better_ _place_ [if] _people_ _could_ [be] [a] _bit_ self 
A|34| B: basically [be] [me] working [to pay] for them [to be] _at_ [a] _day_ _care_ , center . 
B|35| M: i'd say [the] most likely scenario [is] [that] [they] 
A|36| B: exactly . 
B|37| M: so [if] you're [a] mom , they'd [be] deprived ? 
A|38| B: besides which , _it_ [would be] easier , uh , there's [a lot of] single mothers out there now , from divorces [and] [a lot of] , women [are] starting [to have] babies without [a] partner . 
B|39| M: how [would] _you know_ ? 
A|40| B: [and] _to go [to_ work ,] _you are_ worried _about_ [your] _child_ , besides which [you have [to] _get] up_ earlier [to] take [the] _child_ [to] _day_ _care ._ 
B|41| M: [to _be] fair_ [, i] don't [have a] choice [. i] can [get up] [at] [any] [time] . 
A|42| B: [and] [if] [they] were _in _the_ same_ building then _you are _going_ _to_ _the_ _same_ place_ , 
B|43| M: [you are going] _on [the_ same] [day] _, if_ [you are] [in the] exact [same place] . 
A|44| B: [and] [you] [could] _go_ for [your] lunch hour down [and] visit [with] [your] _child_ , or , [you know] [, and] take [your] breaks [with] [your] children , or something . 
B|45| M: [i think] _that's_ what i'd [do .] 
A|46| B: [i think] [i] , [think] _it_ [would [be] fair] . 
B|47| M: why [not] [just] [get a job] ? 
A|48| B: [i think] [if] [, if] [the] [company] [could] [not] provide _it_ _all_ [on] their [own] , for [the] , for [the] [people] [that] [would be] using _it_ , [you know] , [a] certain amount [of] their salary [would] _go to_ _it ._ 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: [but] _it_ [would] still probably [be] cheaper [with] [the] [company] helping , our [if] everybody , [you know] , pulled their [own] weight [in] _it ._ 
B|51| M: [yeah ,] i'd say so . 
A|52| B: [i think] _it_ [would be] _really ._ _really_ great . 
B|53| M: [no _,] but_ [i would] 
A|54| B: [yeah] . 
B|55| M: _we_ [should] [just] [go [to] the] end [of the] world . 
A|56| B: [i do .] 
B|57| M: [not] [really .] 
A|58| B: _eye care_ [is] [good] [. [i] do] [not] [, i] am [not] [i do] [not] _think we_ [have] [that] [on] our policy . 
B|59| M: [eye [care] .] 
A|60| B: [but] , uh , [we] , 
B|61| M: [i [think] we] [all] [do .] 
A|62| B: [yeah] . _it_ [would be] great [, i] [mean] , uh , [the] glasses [that] , [the] exams themselves [are] [not] _expensive_ , [it's] [the] glasses . 
B|63| M: [i [have] a] vision exam _on the_ 19th [. i] will [not be] attending . 
A|64| B: [yeah ,] [that's] true . 
B|65| M: [no ,] [because] [you] don't [have a] choice . 
A|66| B: [right] , now _like_ [my] ... [right .] well , _like_ [my] mother _, _she_ has to go_ for testing cause _she has_ _got_ , 
B|67| M: she's [got] an optician . 
A|68| B: well _, she_ does [not] [have] _it_ [, but] _, she is_ _like_ , [on the] verge [of] _it_ or , something . 
B|69| M: [she has] _her_ [own] problems . 
A|70| B: _her eyes_ [are] changing , 
B|71| M: _oh [,_ i] _see_ . 
A|72| B: [and] _she has [to_ be] _tested_ periodically . [and] [, and] those [are] _expensive_ tests . 
B|73| M: [she has [to go] [to] the] hospital [, she is] [going to] test [her eyes] . 
A|74| B: now [, [i] think] [your] _insurance_ covers [her] [on] [that] , 
B|75| M: [i [have] [to] have] [her eyes] [tested] . 
A|76| B: [but] [you know] , for something _like_ [that] , [that's] [just] as _bad_ as [a] medical , [you know] , [that's] , 
B|77| M: [but] [it's] [a] [good] thing ! 
A|78| B: [right .] 
B|79| M: [right .] jpg 
A|80| B: [right .] 
B|81| M: [right .] 
A|82| B: now [, _i] would like_ _to see_ [better] _dental insurance_ [to] [me] . _was_ [that] our beep ? 
B|83| M: [i would like] [a] chance [to see] some _more_ [of your] [dental insurance] 
A|84| B: [oh] . huh . 
B|85| M: [you know] what , you're [right .] 
A|86| B: okay . 
B|87| M: [i have] [no] idea 
A|88| B: [but] , [with] [the] three children um , orthopedic [care] , um , [not] orthopedic , orthodontic [care] , 
B|89| M: [i] [know] . 
A|90| B: [because] [on] , [on] [a lot [of] the] [dental insurance] , [they] [do] [not] cover [that] well . for [the] , [the] orthodontia stuff . 
B|91| M: why , [because] [it's] [a] dentist ? 
A|92| B: _yes_ , _it_ [is] . 
B|93| M: [it's] [not] [that] [expensive] . 
A|94| B: uh-huh _. right ._ 
B|95| M: [that's] [the] joke . 
A|96| B: [yeah] . 
B|97| M: ohh , [my] [bad] . 
A|98| B: [right .] [my] _middle child_ needs [to have] , uh , orthodontic , he's [because] his , his _pallet_ [is] squared , [not] rounded . 
B|99| M: [your] [middle child] [has] [a] flat stomach , [because] she's [a] [pallet] . 
A|100| B: [and] _it_ affects his speech [a] little [bit] , [not] , [not] anything , [you know] , 
B|101| M: he [was] born [with] [a] mouth [, and] therefore , he can't speak . 
A|102| B: [right .] 
B|103| M: [yes] [. right .] 
A|104| B: [but] [just] enough [that] his bite [is] off [a] little [bit] [and it's] [like] four hundred dollars [, and] [my] [insurance] [is] only [going to] cover [like] fifty [of] _it ._ 
B|105| M: [yeah , i] [was] [just] joking . 
A|106| B: [oh] . 
B|107| M: [i] read an ad . 
A|108| B: [really .] 
B|109| M: i'm sorry [, but] i'm [not] [a] [doctor] . 
A|110| B: [that] sounds [like] _it_ [would] hurt [more] . 
B|111| M: [i] [was] thinking [about] [it .] 
A|112| B: [oh ,] gosh [. i] [, [i] would] [much] rather [that] , [do] [that] , [to] myself than make [my] five year [old] [go] [in] [and] [do] [it .] [that] [would] kill [me] .
