A|0| B: whatever _i'm_ doing _i_ watch _that ._ _i_ usually watch the _news_ either at _you_ _know_ early evening or at ten o'clock 
B|1| M: why 
A|2| B: so _i_ get it from t v a lot . _i_ get time _i read_ time magazine um _that's_ one _i read_ pretty regularly . 
B|3| M: [i read] 
A|4| B: and uh . the thing about it _you_ _know_ now _that_ i've found _is_ _that_ we get such good coverage on t v or at least such [i] don't _know_ attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time _you_ get the time magazine there's nothing in it _you_ don't _know_ . 
B|5| M: no [i'm] there . 
A|6| B: right . then _you_ can _just_ sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i've thought lately there's nothing new in the time magazine . 
B|7| M:  ... 
A|8| B: _you_ _know_ it's it's basically you've heard everything 
B|9| M: [that's] magaz ... 
A|10| B: and uh _you_ might _you_ might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um [i] don't _know_ . so [i] get most of mine from television 
B|11| M: [you] can't . 
A|12| B: [i] _would say_ . 
B|13| M: [you] [would say] [that] ? 
A|14| B: right 
B|15| M:  
A|16| B: and [i] [i] think there's an attempt to do _that ._ [you] _know i_ think people there's a mild attempt for [that] but [i] think basically we basically associate _news_ with bad _news_ or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh [you] _know_ . 
B|17| M:  ... 
A|18| B: [i] think our concept of _news_ isn't necessarily events [that] happen . it's more negative like [you] said . 
B|19| M: _this_ [is] not [news] . 
A|20| B: but [i] think people try to on on t v [i] think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote . 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: uh-huh . 
B|23| M:  ? 
A|24| B: uh-huh . 
B|25| M:  ... 
A|26| B: right . [you] _know_ the war last winter _was_ certainly a good example of [that] because we saw every single thing practically . 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: [i] mean [you] _know i_ remember well _just_ the things [that] are covered . [i] remember watching the world series during the earthquake and _just_ seeing [that] happen 
B|29| M: i' 
A|30| B: [i] mean [you] _know_ [that] _was just_ so phenomenal to see [this] stadium shake and the and the announcers [you] _know_ grabbing 
B|31| M: [i'm] 
A|32| B: [i] mean it's like [that] _was just_ something because [that] _was_ like live and real like [you] said 
B|33| M: [i] [know i] [was just] saying [that .] 
A|34| B: and then of course one thing [i] think too [is] with
