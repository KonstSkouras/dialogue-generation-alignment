B|20| M: uhhh ... [uh] ... _how_ [do] _you [do_ that] ? 
A|21| B: _but_ [i] am _going_ _to_ , _to_ [, uh ,] hopefully next year get _to_ go [back] , cause [, uh ,] _a lot_ _of the_ family has [not] [, uh ,] on her side , _my_ mother's side , has [not] [seen] _, _you_ know ,_ _my_ daughter , so 
B|22| M: uuhh [, uh] 
A|23| B: [i] have one brother , so . 
B|24| M: _i know_ _. i know_ . 
A|25| B: [yes] .

B|28| M: i'm sorry , i'm [a] little confused . 
A|29| B: right _, _i_ _,_ i_ usually see her [a] , couple times [a] year so [that's] no , no big thing . _but _, uh ,_ _i_ , uh , i do_ _, i do_ enjoy [the] reunions . [the] only problem is [that] now [, uh ,] originally when _we_ had _them_ [, uh ,] they were mainly _my_ mother's 
B|30| M: [yeah ,] i'm sure . 
A|31| B: [uh ,] father's . _my_ mother's father's family had quite [a] few [, uh ,] brothers [and] sisters . 
B|32| M: _what_ _are_ your fathers'fathers ? 
A|33| B: so , [it was] [a] large reunion [of] , [of] , [of] [that] group [, uh ,] [from] [that] descendants . 
B|34| M: [i , uh , i do] 
A|35| B: _and [,_ uh ,] _a lot_ [of] those people have [, and] at time _, _you_ know ,_ they all knew one another . 
B|36| M: uhh _, yeah [,_ [uh ,] that's] _what_ [i] said . 
A|37| B: [and] now [it] has gotten [, uh ,] [that] [, uh ,] _a lot_ [of] those people [are] have [, uh ,] have died off , or _, _you_ know [,_ what] _we_ [are] left with is [the] , [the] relatives [of] , [of] , [of] [that] group . 
B|38| M: [but , uh [,] uh] ... 
A|39| B: [and] so _, uh _, it's_ not_ quite as close as [it] used _to_ _be_ . so [, _i] think_ people feel less [of] [a] desire _to_ _really_ go [. i know] [that] , 
B|40| M: uhm 
A|41| B: well [, [i] [,] i] _just_ [think] [that] [, uh _,] _you_ know ,_ at [that] when , when they were _you know ,_ [the] , those were all brothers [and] sisters _a lot_ [and] or they were all _in the_ same geographical location . 
B|42| M: [i ,] 
A|43| B: _you know ,_ [back] _around_ _, _you_ know ,_ _in the_ twenties [and] thirties when they were growing [up] [, uh _,] _you_ know ,_ they were all located together , [in] one small community . 
B|44| M: [you know [,] uh ,] 
A|45| B: [and] as , as time grew _, i mean_ when time went on [the] family grew [and] moved away [and] so forth . [and] now when they come together _it's _,_ it's_ generally _, [you_ know ,] like [say] [the] kids [of] those people who [are] [not] _, [you_ know ,] anywhere near one another [and] [i do] [not] [think] they feel [the] , [the] closeness [that] they used _to_ _be_ there . which is [a] shame 
B|46| M: [that] . 
A|47| B: [but] [that's] _just_ [how] [it] is . _my_ mother [was] complaining last year _about_ [you know _,] it's_ dwindling down every year _, [you_ know [,] that's] _just_ [, _i] think_ [that's] _just_ 
B|48| M: [i think] . 
A|49| B: well [, yeah] . [yeah [,] that's] [, uh [,] yeah [,] [i] think] [that's] some [of] [it] . [but _,] [you_ know [,] i] have [, uh , [i] [,] [i] _,] _it's_ just_ [the] way _, [you_ know [,] [i] think] society is now , is _that we_ [are] [not] , _we_ [do] [not] have [the] extensive family _we_ used _to_ . 
B|50| M: [i] 
A|51| B: _it's_ more [of] [a] _, [you_ know ,] [a] smaller , smaller unit [, and] [you know ,] _we_ , _we_ tend _to_ try _to_ [do] things [, [i] think] with our immediate family , as opposed _to_ [the] extended family .

B|56| M: oh [, it's not] [that] bad . 
A|57| B: [i mean [,] [i] [,] i] used _to_ enjoy _going_ [, i mean] [i] still [do] kind [of] enjoy [it] , [but _, uh ,] _it's_ ,_ [it] does [not] [, it's not] as many people there [that] [i] _really_ , _really_ enjoy seeing . 
B|58| M: [it's [,] uh , it's] . 
A|59| B: [you know [,] [i] [,] it's] _going_ _just_ _for the_ sake [of] getting together [, [i] think] _for the_ family . _and ,_ 
B|60| M: [it's just] [going] [for the] sole purpose [of the] show . 
A|61| B: [uh ,] um , um , no , [not] _really_ . [in] [that] , [but ,] then again [, uh ,] well [, [i] _,] [you_ know [,] i] have some aunts [that] [, uh , [i] [,] [i] [,] i do] . [that's] _about_ _my_ mother's sisters _, [you_ know ,] 
B|62| M: you're [, and ,] 
A|63| B: [but] [i] feel closer _to_ _them_ , because [i] kind [of] grew [up] with _them ._ [but ,] [but , uh ,] as _, [you_ know ,] [for the] rest [of] [that] group , no [not] _really_ . 
B|64| M: [that's] 
A|65| B: [uh _,] [you_ know [,] and [,] and] generally when [i] [was] growing [up] [a lot] [of] those people , [the] only time [i] [ever] saw _them_ [was] at [the] reunion , so [, uh] 
B|66| M: [you know] 
A|67| B: [you do] [not] _really_ feel [that] [that] _really_ close _to_ _them ._
