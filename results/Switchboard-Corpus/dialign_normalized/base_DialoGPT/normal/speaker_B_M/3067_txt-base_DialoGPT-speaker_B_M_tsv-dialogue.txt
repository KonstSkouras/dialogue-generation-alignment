A|21| B: _but_ [i] am _going_ _to_ _to_ [uh] hopefully next year get _to_ go [back] cause [uh] _a lot_ _of the_ family has [not] [uh] on her side _my_ mother's side has [not] [seen] _you know_ _my_ daughter so 
B|22| M: uuhh [uh] 
A|23| B: [i] have one brother so . 
B|24| M: _i know_ _. i know_ . 
A|25| B: [yes] .

A|27| B: right _yeah_ . 
B|28| M: i'm sorry i'm [a] little confused . 
A|29| B: right [i] [i] usually see her [a] couple times [a] year so [that's] no no big thing . _but _uh_ _i_ uh i do_ _i do_ enjoy [the] reunions . [the] only problem is [that] now [uh] originally when _we_ had _them_ [uh] they were mainly _my_ mother's 
B|30| M: [yeah] i'm sure . 
A|31| B: [uh] father's . _my_ mother's father's family had quite [a] few [uh] brothers [and] sisters . 
B|32| M: _what_ _are_ your fathers'fathers ? 
A|33| B: so [it was] [a] large reunion [of] [of] [of] [that] group [uh] [from] [that] descendants . 
B|34| M: [i uh i do] 
A|35| B: [and] [uh] _a lot_ [of] those people have [and] at time _you know_ they all knew one another . 
B|36| M: uhh [yeah] [uh that's] _what_ [i] said . 
A|37| B: [and] now [it] has gotten [uh] [that] [uh] _a lot_ [of] those people [are] have [uh] have died off or _you know_ [what] _we_ [are] left with is [the] [the] relatives [of] [of] [of] [that] group . 
B|38| M: [but uh] [uh] ... 
A|39| B: [and] so _uh _it's_ not_ quite as close as [it] used _to_ _be_ . so _i think_ people feel less [of] [a] desire _to_ _really_ go [. i know] [that] 
B|40| M: uhm 
A|41| B: well [i] [i] _just_ [think] [that] [uh] _you know_ at [that] when when they were _you know_ [the] those were all brothers [and] sisters _a lot_ [and] or they were all _in the_ same geographical location . 
B|42| M: [i] 
A|43| B: _you know_ [back] _around_ _you know_ _in the_ twenties [and] thirties when they were growing [up] [uh] _you know_ they were all located together [in] one small community . 
B|44| M: [you know] [uh] 
A|45| B: [and] as as time grew _i mean_ when time went on [the] family grew [and] moved away [and] so forth . [and] now when they come together _it's_ _it's_ generally [you know] like [say] [the] kids [of] those people who [are] [not] [you know] anywhere near one another [and] [i do] [not] [think] they feel [the] [the] closeness [that] they used _to_ _be_ there . which is [a] shame 
B|46| M: [that] . 
A|47| B: [but] [that's] _just_ [how] [it] is . _my_ mother [was] complaining last year _about_ [you know] _it's_ dwindling down every year [you know] [that's] _just_ _i think_ [that's] _just_ 
B|48| M: [i think] . 
A|49| B: well [yeah] . [yeah] [that's] [uh] [yeah] [i think] [that's] some [of] [it] . [but] [you know] [i] have [uh i] [i] _it's just_ [the] way [you know] [i think] society is now is _that we_ [are] [not] _we_ [do] [not] have [the] extensive family _we_ used _to_ . 
B|50| M: [i] 
A|51| B: _it's_ more [of] [a] [you know] [a] smaller smaller unit [and] [you know] _we_ _we_ tend _to_ try _to_ [do] things [i think] with our immediate family as opposed _to_ [the] extended family . [of] people _that we_ may or may [not] remember or [know] [you know] very well .

A|53| B: [uh] 
B|54| M: _that's [a_ lot] [i mean] [it's] [a lot] . 
A|55| B: right [it] requires [a lot] [of] effort _to_ _to_ _to_ [do that] sort [of] thing . 
B|56| M: oh [it's not] [that] bad . 
A|57| B: [i mean] [i] [i] used _to_ enjoy _going_ [i mean] [i] still [do] kind [of] enjoy [it] [but _uh] it's_ [it] does [not] [it's not] as many people there [that] [i] _really_ _really_ enjoy seeing . 
B|58| M: [it's] [uh it's] . 
A|59| B: [you know] [i] [it's] _going_ _just_ _for the_ sake [of] getting together [i think] _for the_ family . [and] 
B|60| M: [it's just] [going] [for the] sole purpose [of the] show . 
A|61| B: [uh] um um no [not] _really_ . [in] [that] [but] then again [uh] well [i] [you know] [i] have some aunts [that] [uh i] [i] [i do] . [that's] _about_ _my_ mother's sisters [you know] 
B|62| M: you're [and] 
A|63| B: [but] [i] feel closer _to_ _them_ because [i] kind [of] grew [up] with _them ._ [but] [but uh] as [you know] [for the] rest [of] [that] group no [not] _really_ . 
B|64| M: [that's] 
A|65| B: [uh] [you know] [and] [and] generally when [i] [was] growing [up] [a lot] [of] those people [the] only time [i] [ever] saw _them_ [was] at [the] reunion so [uh] 
B|66| M: [you know] 
A|67| B: [you do] [not] _really_ feel [that] [that] _really_ close _to_ _them ._
