A|26| B: uh-huh . 
B|27| M: [she's] beautiful 
A|28| B: yep . 
B|29| M: she has [a] [small] nose . 
A|30| B: well , _they_ _are_ , _they_ _are_ _the_ ultimate [dog] [to] [have] around kids [so] long as [your] kid [is] [not] scared _of_ [a] big [dog ,] because [i] had [a retriever] , actually [i] had [a retriever] irish setter cross . which [is a] really nice animal 
B|31| M: she . 
A|32| B: and fortunately [it] _was just_ _like [a_ retriever] and then [i've] had [a retriever .] 
B|33| M: you're [dog] ? 
A|34| B: [it] _was_ gorgeous _. it_ _was just_ gorgeous . [i] mean _just_ gorgeous . um , and _they_ both , [you] [know] , both _the_ half [breed] and _the_ pure [breed] had _the_ , uh _, [what_ i] consider _the_ , _the_ , _the_ perfect disposition . but [you] [know] [what] , [you] [know] [what] scares [me] [about] [golden] retrievers ? since they've become [so] popular [you] _get_ [what i] call backyard breeders . which [is] probably where yours came from . people [that] don't [know] [what] they're [doing] , and _they_ [breed] [them] , [you] [know] , [for] [a] certain characteristic . and in _the_ retrievers [it] happens [to] be _they_ [like] [them] big , [for] somehow big [is] perceived as _the_ better . and when [you] start [doing] [that] [you] really tamper [with] , [you] [know] , _the_ , _all_ _the_ , _the_ years _of_ , uh , culling litters and , and , uh , [you] tamper [with] [what] _the dog_ innately [is] . 
B|35| M:  . 
A|36| B: we when _i was_ , when [i] bought my last purebred [retriever] [i] mean [i] looked _all_ over because [i wanted] one [that] still looked _like [a_ retriever] , [you] [know] , _the_ short [to] _the_ ground , stocky , [golden] , uh , trainable , tractable , quiet animal [that] could hunt and still be in _the_ house . 
B|37| M:  
A|38| B: and [i] ended up getting one [that] , uh , came out _of_ [a] , [a] , [a] hunting stock because [i wanted] one [that] could still perform _like [a_ retriever] [did] . 
B|39| M: [what] ? 
A|40| B: and [i've seen] an awful lot _of_ lately really dumb , dumb retrievers and _i'm_ , and [i] really fear [for] _the_ [breed] because [i] love [that] [breed] , 
B|41| M: [i'm] [so] _much_ 
A|42| B: but [i] really figure right when [it] becomes really popular [that] [it's] going [to] be ruined . 
B|43| M: [you] [can] _get a_ pretty _good_ _dog _that_ can_ handle [a] high level [of] water . 
A|44| B: oh , yeah . [you] bet _you ._ [you] bet _you ._ [you] [know] how _they_ came up [with] _the_ [retriever] , don't [you] , _the_ [golden] ? 
B|45| M: [golden] ret 
A|46| B: [it] _was_ bred out [of] several different retrievers , and _they_ bred [it for] companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and , and ability [to] hunt _. it_ _was_ kept only by kings . 
B|47| M: [the] _. the_ . [dogs .] [are] . _good_ . 
A|48| B: but _they_ selectively culled those litters , [i] mean , [for] many hundreds [of] years and since [it] slept in [the] castle [with] its master , [i] mean [it] had , [it] had [to] be [of] [a] disposition [to] make [it] , [you] [know] , an animal [you] could keep around [that] closely . but _they_ would go through _all_ [the] litters and destroy [the] puppies if _they_ were anything other than perfect . now , [you] [know] , [that] seems _like a_ cruel thing [to] do . 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: on [the] other hand , [you] sure , [you] [know] , _they_ sure created [a] , [a] wonderful [breed] , [i] mean [a] wonderful [breed] . 
B|51| M: lol 
A|52| B: uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [i] 
A|54| B: well , [i] tell [you] , [you] [know] [the] , [the] _german shepherd_ [is] [the] classic case [of] [what] [i'm] talking [about] because in america [that's] called [a] rin tin tin phenomena . 
B|55| M: [you .] 
A|56| B: only in america [is] there [a dog] called _a german shepherd_ . 
B|57| M: [i [was] just] making [a] joke [about] [the dog] being [a german] shepard . 
A|58| B: [that] [dog] [is] bred out [of] three european [dogs [.] the] belgian tervurien , [a german] skutzhund , and [a] makes [a] [i] always forget [the] third one . [i] [can] see _it ._ uh , uh , but [the] third one [is a] children's [dog .] 
B|59| M: why does [this] [dog] [look [like] [a] german shepherd] ? 
A|60| B: and there [are] distinct breeds in europe . now [what] happened over here [was] [is] [that] people saw [the] , [the] first , um , which would actually [have] [been] [a] skutzhund which [is] [what] rin tin tin [was] . 
B|61| M: wait [, what] ? 
A|62| B: and everybody [wanted] rin tin tin . and [it] [was] known as [a german shepherd] here _. so_ _they_ created [a] [breed] standard [. the] american kennel club [did] . 
B|63| M: [so] [. the] [. [it] .] [all] [. so] . fine [. [it] .] 
A|64| B: [that] said anything [that] [is a] skutzhund , [a] , [a] tervurien and , uh , alsatian [that's] [the] other one . alsatian , any inner breeding [of] [that can] be called [a german shepherd] here . 
B|65| M: [german shepherd] 
A|66| B: and [what] happened [is] , [is] [that] people [wanted] [this] [shepherd] [to] [shepherd] and protect . and _they_ bred [a dog that] [i] [it's] called [a] , an animal's critical span which basically translates [to] how [much] shit will [it] take before [it] bites [you .] [that] [german shepherd] , [the] american [german shepherd] here [was] [a] , [a] , [a] such an unreliable animal [that] [the] american seeing eye institute refused [to] use [them] , because _they_ would turn on on their handlers . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| B: and even , um , uh , police corps which started , [you] [know] , finding other breeds [to] use because [this] thing , [this] , [this] thing known as [a german shepherd] here , its personality and its dependability and its reliability [was just] terrible [. so] [about] fifteen years ago [the] [german shepherd] club [of] america decided amongst themselves [that] _they_ were going [to] change [this] [. so] _they_ went back [to] europe and brought back some [good] examples [of] each [of] [the] three breeds and bred [to] [a] standard [what] _they_ [wanted] an american [german shepherd] [to] be . which [is a] very heavily now skutzhund and alsatian , 
B|69| M:  
A|70| B: and [it's] [the] alsatian [that's] [the] kid's [dog .] [it's] [just] , [you] see [them] in europe and they're [just] lovely . 
B|71| M: [they] . 
A|72| B: but you'll see , [i] mean , if [you ever] start looking in papers now and [you] start seeing these ads [for] [german] shepherds , [they] will say on [them] , bred [for] disposition , [a] k c conforming which means [that] their advertising [that] [this is] no longer an indiscriminate [dog .] 
B|73| M: [i] 
A|74| B: [this is] bred [for] , and [they] had [to] go through and destroy [a] , [for] [a] while there , [about] seventy-five percent [of] their puppies [that] [they] bred . 
B|75| M:  
A|76| B: because [they] were looking [for] [this] disposition . and nowadays [you] , you'll [get] , you'll [get [a] dog] trainer [to] recommend [a] specific , [you] [know] , breeder handler . [they] will recommend their shepherds as [a] children's [dog .] 
B|77| M: why ? 
A|78| B: but ...
