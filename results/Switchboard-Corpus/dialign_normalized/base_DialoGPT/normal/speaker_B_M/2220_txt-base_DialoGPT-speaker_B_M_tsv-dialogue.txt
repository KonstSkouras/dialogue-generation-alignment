B|113| M: [no] 
A|114| B: because [if] _that's what_ , [if] _that's what_ [the] punishment [is] [in] [that] , [in] [that] instance , then you're always [going [to] say] , [you know ,] [not] you're , you're [not] [going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have] [that] uh , [that] punishment . [so ,] 
B|115| M: [it] 
A|116| B: uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [that's what [i] said] .
