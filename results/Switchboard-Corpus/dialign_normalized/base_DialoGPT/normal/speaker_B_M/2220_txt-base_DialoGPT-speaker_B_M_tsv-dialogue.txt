[you know] [if] [you] [if] [you] [don't] believe [like] [if] [this] was [a] capital crime [and [and] you] [don't] believe [in] [if] [you] [don't] believe [in] death penalty you're [not] [going to be] picked [at] [all] . [so] [but] 
B|111| M: [i] 
A|112| B: [yeah] [so] see [there] [there] [they] [would] [have] [a] doubt [about] [you] [that] [you know] 
B|113| M: [no] 
A|114| B: because [if] _that's what_ [if] _that's what_ [the] punishment [is] [in] [that] [in] [that] instance then you're always [going [to] say] [you know] [not] you're you're [not] [going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have] [that] uh [that] punishment . [so] 
B|115| M: [it] 
A|116| B: uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [that's what [i] said] . 
A|118| B: [well] especially [with] something where [you] [have to] [you] [have to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . [you] [have to] find whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like] [do you] [really] [feel] [that] sure [about]
