B|84| M: [right .] 
A|85| B: "we did [it] [that] year [and] then [the] following summer [we] did [not] [have] [all] [of] [the] family [there .] [we] sent invitations . [we] [said] ""please let [us] [know] [if] you're coming . "" [it] [was when] [uh] his mother his step father _had_ died [the] year before"
