B|78| M:  ...

A|83| B: [and [,] and ,] [uh ,] [it] [was] an enormous task [to] bring [all] [of] those people [together] with just one or two people helping . [and ,] [uh ,] _we had_ [to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] [all] [of] them [and] [i] told him , 
B|84| M: [right .] 
A|85| B: "we did [it] [that] year [, and] then [the] following summer , [we] did [not] [have] [all] [of] [the] family [there .] [we] sent invitations . [we] [said] , ""please let [us] [know] [if] you're coming . "" [it] [was when] , [uh ,] his mother , his step father _had_ died [the] year before , " 
B|86| M: [i] [was ,] 
A|87| B: [and] [it] , his mother [was] alone [, _and] [so_ they] came [to] support her [, and] then one by one , his [you [know] ,] his sisters , [he] began [to] lose family members , 
B|88| M: [we] . 
A|89| B: [and] [it] [was] difficult [to] hold them [together] . [and] then , [of] course , [he] died two years ago [, [so] ,] [you [know] ,] [that] family has gone down [to] one brother [and] one sister [now .] 
B|90| M: [and ,] 
A|91| B: [and ,] [uh ,] [it] , [i] [think] [that's what] happens [when] [they] get scattered [, the] [, the] family unit , [you [know] ,] falls , into disrepair .
