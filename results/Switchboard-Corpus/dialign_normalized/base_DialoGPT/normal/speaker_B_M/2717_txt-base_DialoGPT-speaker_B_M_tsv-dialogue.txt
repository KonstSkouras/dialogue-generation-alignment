A|0| B: uh-huh . 
B|1| M: _i think_ _you're_ confusing _the sentence_ _with_ _the sentence_ . 
A|2| B: _yeah_ . uh-huh _well_ from _what_ [i] [i] saw _a_ statistic just _a_ few days ago um _so_ far this year or _was_ _it_ during [the] last year during _a_ year's time _i think it_ _was_ _they_ executed twenty-five people _in_ [the] nation . meanwhile there were twenty-five hundred people on death row . _so_ [i] [i] _and it's_ building up _you know_ they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them _so_ _it's_ really building up . 
B|3| M: n 
A|4| B: uh-huh . 
B|5| M: _no_ 
A|6| B: _yeah_ everybody's _got_ that . 
B|7| M: [so] . 
A|8| B: uh-huh . _yeah_ . uh-huh . 
B|9| M: _no_ _but_ _you can_ . 
A|10| B: _yeah_ . isn't isn't _maryland_ where [the] famous willy horton case _was_ . 
B|11| M: [well] ? 
A|12| B: _it_ _was uh_ that _was_ [the] one that _was_ used [so] much _in_ [the] campaign . _in_ [the] _in_ [the] presidential race . _uh_ may _it_ may _not_ _have_ been _maryland_ . _it_ may _have_ been massachusetts [i] don't remember . 
B|13| M: [maryland] 
A|14| B: anyway [well] [the] question _is_ _you know_ do [you] _think it does_ make _a_ difference _in_ whether or _not_ _a_ criminal commits _a_ crime or do [you] _think it_ [can] if _it's_ done right ? 
B|15| M: i'ma 
A|16| B: if _it_ 
B|17| M: [i [think it] does] . 
A|18| B: uh-huh 
B|19| M: [yeah] [what] ? 
A|20| B: [yeah] . [well] [i think] _in_ large measure [the] reason _they_ don't care _it's_ _not_ _because the_ punishment [but] [so] many _of_ [the] people that commit crimes don't get punished . 
B|21| M: [because the] justice system [is] flawed . 
A|22| B: _the police_ don't catch them or [the] courts don't convict them or or _they_ don't serve very much _of_ [the] time _and_ _so uh_ _you know_ _their_ _their_ success rate [is] very high . crime [does] pay [you can] make _a_ good living at _it ._ 
B|23| M: _i'm not sure_ . 
A|24| B: [yeah] . 
B|25| M: [a] 
A|26| B: last year [it] _was_ d c [i] guess baltimore caught them . 
B|27| M: [you] [got] lucky 
A|28| B: uh-huh 
B|29| M: _i'm_ sorry _but we_ _have to_ keep [it] alive [and] alive [and] [not] die . 
A|30| B: [yeah] . 
B|31| M: [so uh] what's _the next_ step ? 
A|32| B: [yeah] [the] only consolation [is] [so] many _of_ [the] murders are _you know _the_ the_ violent people going against each other [and] [so] _they_ _you know_ society's [not] going [to] put them [to] death [well] at least maybe _the guy_ _they_ cross [next] time [is] going [to] . [uh] [i think] [i think] capital punishment [is] an appropriate punishment for [the] kind _of_ people where [we] say _you know_ this sort _of_ person [is] just [not] acceptable [to] our society [and] [we] are there by going [to] remove them from society [not] temporarily [but] permanently . 
B|33| M:  
A|34| B: [i] mean [i] [i] personally [think] life imprisonment [i] don't [think] much _of_ _of_ life imprisonment . first _of_ all _it's_ never turns _out_ [to] be life [but] second _you know_ why should [we] [the] idea _of_ life imprisonment [with] [no] chance _of_ parole . [well] that means [you're] going [to] put them _in_ [a] cage [you] [think] _it's_ never ever going [to] be safe for them [to] walk [the] streets again [well] then why bother . just execute them [because] _that's_ that way [you're] [sure] they'll never ever going [to] walk [the] streets again . 
B|35| M:  
A|36| B: [so] any any anybody that says life _in_ prison [with] [no] chance _of_ parole i'd say [uh] give them [the] death _penalty_ [so] 
B|37| M: [you] 
A|38| B: [yeah] [and] [and] also um _the the_ thing [i] don't like about [a] lot _of_ these court trials [and] [a] lot _of_ these appeals [is] that _it's_ [not] based on [what] [is] true [and] [what] [is] false [but] rather _it's_ on [the] rules _of_ evidence [what] [can] [i] hide [and] [what] do [i] [have to] tell . 
B|39| M:  
A|40| B: [and] [i think] our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding _out_ [the] truth than _they_ currently are . 
B|41| M: [i] can't . 
A|42| B: [and] [and] that way [we] [can] be [sure] _you know_ [we] [can] find _out_ [the] truth [we] [can] find _out_ [what] really happened [and] [and] base [the sentence] on [what] [the] person _did_ [not] on [what] we're allowed [to] let _the jury_ hear 
B|43| M:  
A|44| B: uh-huh 
B|45| M: [i think] he's [in] jail 
A|46| B: uh-huh . 
B|47| M: [i think] he [was uh] [uh] . 
A|48| B: just started shooting people [because] _they_ botched [the] first _job_ 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: [and] [so] now they're going [to] get even . 
B|51| M: [you're] [and it's] 
A|52| B: [yeah] . 
B|53| M: [that's] [a] bit weird

A|60| B: oh . 
B|61| M: [well] he [was] accused [of] [it .] 
A|62| B: uh-huh . 
B|63| M: yea _. i_ [know] . 
A|64| B: uh-huh . 
B|65| M: uhhhhh ... huh ? 
A|66| B: _the the penalty_ phase [yeah] they've decide _the penalty_ separately from [the] verdict . 
B|67| M: [the [the] the penalty] 
A|68| B: uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [it's] [uh] _not ._ 
A|70| B: [yeah] [well] [you know] [you] just [have to] decide [you know] [well] there's really two separate decisions there [i] guess one [is] [did] [it] really happen [the] way [the the] prosecutor said [it] happened [you know] [is] this man really guilty [and] [you] [have to] decide that [but] then [you] [have to] decide [you know] as [a] member [of] society [what] do [i] want [to] do [with] this [guy] who [did] this thing . 
B|71| M: h 
A|72| B: [and] that [i] i've never been on [a jury] i've never had that experience [i'm not sure] i'd look forward [to] making that kind [of] decision about [a] man's life . 
B|73| M: [i] 
A|74| B: uh-huh 
B|75| M: [you're] . 
A|76| B: uh-huh . [yeah] . [well] [the] thing i'd be most likely [to] attach [the] death [penalty] [to] [is] [the] violence [. i] mean [i] [can] handle people people selling drugs [you know] [it's] [it's] wrong [but] [it] [it's] [not] worth somebody getting executed for . [but we] hear [so] much about [the] violence [and] how [it's] [not] safe [to] walk [the] streets [because] somebody [you know] these random drive by shootings [and] that sort [of] thing . 
B|77| M:  
A|78| B: [and the] people i'd most likely want [to] [sentence] [to] death are [the] people that just show [a] really low regard for human life . that [you know] [you] never [know] when they're going [to] turn or hurt [the next] person [because] [it] doesn't really matter [to] them whether someone else gets hurt or [not .] 
B|79| M:  ... 
A|80| B: [and] [so] [i] go these are [the] kind [of] people [i] would like [to] get [out] [of] here [and] get [out] [of] circulation [and] say [i] don't [we] don't accept your kind [in] our society .
