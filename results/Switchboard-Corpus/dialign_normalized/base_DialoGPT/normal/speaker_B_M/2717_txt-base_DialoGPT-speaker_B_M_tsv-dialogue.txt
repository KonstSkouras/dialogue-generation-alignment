B|77| M:  
A|78| B: [and the] people i'd most likely want [to] [sentence] [to] death are [the] people that just show [a] really low regard for human life . that , [you know ,] [you] , never [know] when they're going [to] turn or hurt [the next] person [because] [it] doesn't really matter [to] them whether someone else gets hurt or [not .] 
B|79| M:  ...
