B|9| M: _i'm_ pretty sure [we don't] [regressive] [taxes .]

B|11| M: [i think] [we] _should_ [just] [do] [a] [tax] [on] [income] . 
A|12| B: it [should] be , [i think] , [a] flat percentage and [, uh ,] that percentage ought to be _an_ equitable _amount_ . 
B|13| M: [what] _is_ [the] average [amount] [of money] [you make] ? 
A|14| B: [uh ,] last year when they passed [the] [tax] laws for [the] [, uh ,] nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one [uh ,] [i] added up all [the] [taxes] that [we] were going to pay [on] all these different specific luxury items and _travel expenses_ and everything else , 
B|15| M: [travel expenses] . 
A|16| B: and [i] totaled them all up and basically [, uh ,] [we] were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent [tax] . 
B|17| M: uhhh ... 
A|18| B: now , that was [the] assumption that [you] spent that same dollar for every , for every item [on] there even though _there's_ [, uh ,] [taxes] [on] different things . 
B|19| M:  
A|20| B: but , [you] know _, there's_ _there's_ [a] lot [of] [taxes] [you] pay that you're _not_ even aware [of] that you're paying [, uh ,] like when [you] buy [a] tire , [you] pay [a] federal excise [tax] . 
B|21| M: _yeah_ _, i'm_ [a] big fan [of] _this_ idea . 
A|22| B: [you] pay gasoline [taxes] every time [you] pump something into your , your tank . 
B|23| M: _yeah_ [, uh [,] there's] [an] 
A|24| B: but [you] probably pay more percentage wise in other [taxes .] 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: [yeah] if [you] implemented [a] flat percentage , it would encourage people [, uh ,] to [make] more [money] and [the] _, what_ people need to understand in my opinion , now [this] [is] [just] my opinion , okay [, uh ,] [is] that businesses create jobs and jobs create [income] and [income] pays [taxes .] 
B|27| M: [you] 
A|28| B: and , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough to say , _here's_ my break point [, i'm] _not_ going to work any harder and [make] any more or create any more jobs . 
B|29| M: no , 
A|30| B: and so , based [on] that , who [do] [you] [think] you're talking to , you're talking to [an] employer .
