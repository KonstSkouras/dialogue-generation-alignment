A|0| B: uh-huh . 
B|1| M: fun . 
A|2| B: right . 
B|3| M: _they have , uh ,_ _recycling_ . 
A|4| B: oh . right . over here _, they_ [, uh ,] [have] several private companies _that_ _you_ can take [, uh ,] recycled , materials to . but [, uh ,] if _you_ want to take them all to one place _, [they_ have , uh ,] _the_ first saturday of every month _, [they_ have] certain places _that_ _you_ can drop them off . _that's_ _what_ _i_ _do_ . [uh _,] and_ _i , i_ recycle aluminum , glass [, uh ,] newspapers . 
B|5| M:  
A|6| B: so _it's_ nice to [have _,] you_ _know ,_ one place _that_ _you_ can take them all to instead of driving _the_ glass to one place 
B|7| M: [that] . 
A|8| B: right . so _it's ,_ so _that's_ nice . _it_ would be , _it_ would be really nice if [they] [, uh ,] came to _the_ house to pick _it_ up _and_ [they] just were talking _about_ _a_ bill _in_ tucson _about_ _that ,_ but [, uh [,] uh ,] _it_ didn't go through . 
B|9| M: [i , i] 
A|10| B: right . [i] guess _what_ [they] , _what_ [they] were talking _about_ here was [, uh ,] was reducing _the_ garbage collection _in_ order to make [that] up or something _, you_ _know ._ 
B|11| M: [that] . 
A|12| B: [uh ,] so [i] guess _that's_ one option . 
B|13| M: i'll [do] [you] think [about] [it] . 
A|14| B: [i] guess one _thing_ they're working on now is [recycling] plastics too . like [, uh] 
B|15| M: [that's] good . 
A|16| B: [have] [you] noticed [that] on _the_ bottom of plastic goods _, [they_ have] _this_ little number now [that] tells _what_ kind of plastic [it] is ? 
B|17| M: [i] think [they] [do] [, and] [it's] [a] good [thing] . 
A|18| B: yeah [, i] guess _the_ _problem with_ plastic is there's so many different kinds [that] [you] can't recycle _, you_ can't just throw all plastic into one recycler . 
B|19| M: [i] _have a_ _friend_ [that's] [a] mechanic who's been [in] [the] field for 20 years . he said he has [the] same [problem with] metal . 
A|20| B: yeah . so now they're like marking [, uh ,] they're [, _i] don't _know_ ,_ there's six , seven , eight different kind of plastics [and] [they] _, they_ mark on [the] bottom _what_ kind [it] is . 
B|21| M: i've seen [this] before , 
A|22| B: so [i] guess [that] makes [it] easy to recycle [and] then they're , they're [, uh ,] trying to make plastic goods [that] _don't_ [have a] bunch of different plastics [in] them _, you_ _know _,_ that_ are _, that_ are only made out of one kind of plastic so [that] [that] makes [it] easier [i] guess . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: right . 
B|25| M: [i] 
A|26| B: where does your [friend] go to to recycle ? 
B|27| M: [don't] [, they] don'you , 'they [do] , ' 
A|28| B: uh-huh . 
B|29| M: i'm sorry . 
A|30| B: yeah . 
B|31| M: [what] [about] her ? 
A|32| B: yeah . 
B|33| M: uhm ... [i don't [know] .] 
A|34| B: [i] guess [that's] how [it] gets _passed_ on . [you] _know ,_ when one _person_ _, you_ hear from another _person_ 
B|35| M: she says [that] [in] her voice . 
A|36| B: [and] then [, uh [,] and] then _you [,_ and] then [you] pass [it] on . 
B|37| M: no . not even [the] [person] who [passed] [it] . 
A|38| B: [it] seems to be catching on [, uh ,] slowly but surely [, i] guess 
B|39| M: [that's] [the] [thing] . 
A|40| B: uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [i] [know [,] uh] huh 
A|42| B: uh-huh . wow , [that's] cute . [that's] neat , yeah . when _you ,_ 
B|43| M: no , [it's [,] [you] [,] [that] ,] you're . 
A|44| B: well , when [you] start early [, i] guess ,
