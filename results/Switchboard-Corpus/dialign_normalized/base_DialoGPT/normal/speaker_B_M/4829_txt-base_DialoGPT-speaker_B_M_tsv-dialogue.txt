A|0| B: uh-huh . 
B|1| M: fun . 
A|2| B: right . 
B|3| M: _they have uh_ _recycling_ . 
A|4| B: oh . right . over here [they] [uh] [have] several private companies _that_ _you_ can take [uh] recycled materials to . but [uh] if _you_ want to take them all to one place [they have uh] _the_ first saturday of every month [they have] certain places _that_ _you_ can drop them off . _that's_ _what_ _i_ _do_ . [uh] _and_ _i i_ recycle aluminum glass [uh] newspapers . 
B|5| M:  
A|6| B: so _it's_ nice to [have] _you_ _know_ one place _that_ _you_ can take them all to instead of driving _the_ glass to one place 
B|7| M: [that] . 
A|8| B: right . so _it's_ so _that's_ nice . _it_ would be _it_ would be really nice if [they] [uh] came to _the_ house to pick _it_ up _and_ [they] just were talking _about_ _a_ bill _in_ tucson _about_ [that] but [uh] [uh] _it_ didn't go through . 
B|9| M: [i i] 
A|10| B: right . [i] guess _what_ [they] _what_ [they] were talking _about_ here was [uh] was reducing _the_ garbage collection _in_ order to make [that] up or something _you_ _know ._ 
B|11| M: [that] . 
A|12| B: [uh] so [i] guess _that's_ one option . 
B|13| M: i'll [do] [you] think [about] [it] . 
A|14| B: [i] guess one _thing_ they're working on now is [recycling] plastics too . like [uh] 
B|15| M: [that's] good . 
A|16| B: [have] [you] noticed [that] on _the_ bottom of plastic goods [they have] _this_ little number now [that] tells _what_ kind of plastic [it] is ? 
B|17| M: [i] think [they] [do] [and] [it's] [a] good [thing] . 
A|18| B: yeah [i] guess _the_ _problem with_ plastic is there's so many different kinds [that] [you] can't recycle [you] can't just throw all plastic into one recycler . 
B|19| M: [i] _have a_ _friend_ [that's] [a] mechanic who's been [in] [the] field for 20 years . he said he has [the] same [problem with] metal . 
A|20| B: yeah . so now they're like marking [uh] they're _i don't know_ there's six seven eight different kind of plastics [and] [they] [they] mark on [the] bottom _what_ kind [it] is . 
B|21| M: i've seen [this] before 
A|22| B: so [i] guess [that] makes [it] easy to recycle [and] then they're they're [uh] trying to make plastic goods [that] _don't_ [have a] bunch of different plastics [in] them [you] _know_ [that] are [that] are only made out of one kind of plastic so [that] [that] makes [it] easier [i] guess . 
B|23| M:  
A|24| B: right . 
B|25| M: [i] 
A|26| B: where does your [friend] go to to recycle ? 
B|27| M: [don't] [they] don'you'they [do] ' 
A|28| B: uh-huh . 
B|29| M: i'm sorry . 
A|30| B: yeah . 
B|31| M: [what] [about] her ? 
A|32| B: yeah . 
B|33| M: uhm ... [i don't [know] .] 
A|34| B: [i] guess [that's] how [it] gets _passed_ on . [you] [know] when one _person_ [you] hear from another _person_ 
B|35| M: she says [that] [in] her voice . 
A|36| B: [and] then [uh] [and] then [you] [and] then [you] pass [it] on . 
B|37| M: no . not even [the] [person] who [passed] [it] . 
A|38| B: [it] seems to be catching on [uh] slowly but surely [i] guess 
B|39| M: [that's] [the] [thing] . 
A|40| B: uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [i] [know] [uh] huh 
A|42| B: uh-huh . wow [that's] cute . [that's] neat yeah . when [you] 
B|43| M: no [it's] [you] [that] you're . 
A|44| B: well when [you] start early [i] guess
