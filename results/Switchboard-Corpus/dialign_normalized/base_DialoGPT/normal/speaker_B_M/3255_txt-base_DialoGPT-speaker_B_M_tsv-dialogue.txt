A|34| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|35| M: yay ! another day [of] being 
A|36| B: [well] that's [the] way _it has_ gotten here . 
B|37| M: _i think you_ 
A|38| B: [we] have [just] had _that_ law [i think] _about_ [a] year maybe [a] year [and] [a] half here [in] texas 
B|39| M: [i don't] [know] [i'm] [from] [the] uk [and] i've [never] seen [a] single thing [about] [it] .

B|41| M: [i think] [it] would be [a good] policy . 
A|42| B: [and] _uh but_ [if] _they_ [are] polluting [the] air _they_ need [do] need [to] have them fixed 
B|43| M: no [it's] [just] [a] [bad] solution . 
A|44| B: [and] [you know] [there's a] big move especially [in the] industrial part [in] texas right now [of] controlling [the] c f c _that_ [the] big manufacturing companies [are] producing into [the] air they're having [to] change [the] type [of] products _they_ use

B|49| M: uhhhh . [you're] _not_ gonna [get away] with [this] . 
A|50| B: therefore [the] individual every time [they] have [a] _service_ call [if] [they] have an old _unit_ that's still using [this] twenty-two _freon_ or whatever _it [is_ it] _costs_ them three times as much [to] _get it_ fixed 
B|51| M: [i'm] pretty [sure] [the] [costs] [of] replacing [a] broken [unit] [is] covered [by] [the] warranty . 
A|52| B: [and] _uh_ [if] [you] have [a new] high efficiency system _that_ uses [the new] type [of] freons _that_ [do] [not] release as many c f c into [the] atmosphere [it] doesn't cost as much [so] eventually [people] [are] [going to] have [to] go [to] newer systems [you know] 
B|53| M:  
A|54| B: [but] 
B|55| M: [it's] [like] [the] [freon] 
A|56| B: uh-huh . right .

B|61| M: uhhh [yeah] [uh but] ... 
A|62| B: uh-huh . 
B|63| M: uuh why ? 
A|64| B: [it's] probably _happened to_ millions [of] [people] 
B|65| M: [yeah] [i know] [but] [i] don t [know] [if] [it has] [happened to] [other] [people] . 
A|66| B: uh-huh . uh-huh .
