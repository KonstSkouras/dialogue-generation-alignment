A|0| B: yeah . yeah i've had _a_ variety of different jobs with _a_ various types _uh_ in _the_ computer field . _and_ _so_ i've seen _a_ variety of types of benefits . _uh_ i've worked _for_ _for_ _for_ awhile _and_ they _are you_ _know_ _a_ really academic type of place . _and_ then i've worked with regular _you_ _know_ industry type places . _and_ then with others _that_ _are_ kind of half way between _and_ stuff _. so_ i've seen _a_ wide range of both _you_ _know_ nonsalary type benefits _and_ other stuff _you_ _know_ _like_ health care _that's_ either fully or partially paid _and_ _you_ _know_ some _have_ _like_ bonuses _and_ others _have_ had lots of vacation time _but_ _not_ much other types of benefits _and_ _so_ yeah _i_ would 
B|1| M:  
A|2| B: i'd say health care _is_ way up there especially anybody with kids . _uh_ _and_ _that's_ one of _the_ big things _that_ we always _look_ at _you_ _know ._ when we when _i think_ _about_ changing jobs _is_ _you_ _know_ _you_ _know_ _what_ kind of health care they _have_ 
B|3| M:  
A|4| B: _and_ does _the_ _company_ pay _for_ it _. you_ _know_ all or partially or _how_ does _that_ work . 
B|5| M: yes . 
A|6| B: _and_ _uh_ also _uh_ vacation time too _is_ _a_ _is_ _a_ big one _for_ me . _uh_ _and_ _i_ guess support _for_ whatever whatever other _you_ _know_ kinds of professional activities _you_ _have_ at _you_ _know_ work . 
B|7| M: [you] . 
A|8| B: _uh_ cause i've been at places which offer _a_ lot of support _and_ others _that_ don't offer any _and_ some _that_ sometimes _that's_ coincided with _a_ place _that_ offers more vacation time though 
B|9| M:  
A|10| B: _so_ _that's not_ _so_ bad [you] _know ._ 
B|11| M: i'm [uh] _good_ . 
A|12| B: [you] _know_ it's kind of _a_ give _and_ take kind of thing _i think ._ 
B|13| M: oh okay . 
A|14| B: [uh] _i_ say _that_ health care _is_ probably definitely number one though . want _to_ just [you] _know_ all your salary can't even begin _to_ pay _for_ _what_ [you] can wind up losing [you] _know_ in _a_ major illness or something . [uh] . 
B|15| M: hahaha . [that's] _great_ . 
A|16| B: yeah . 
B|17| M: uhh [and] ? 
A|18| B: uh-huh . 
B|19| M: [i] 
A|20| B: yeah . flexible hours _are_ _are_ pretty important _to_ me as _well_ . 
B|21| M: [but] [. so] . 
A|22| B: [uh] cause _that makes_ _a_ big difference . my wife _works_ part-time . 
B|23| M: [well] [i] [have] [a] _job ._ 
A|24| B: [and] _she works_ [uh] as [a] assistant manager in [a] fabric store . 
B|25| M: [i] [know .] [she works] _for a_ [company] [that makes] clothing . 
A|26| B: [and] [so] [she works] [a] lot of evenings [and] weekends [and] [so] two days [a] week [i] [uh] manage _to_ get home early enough _to_ meet _the_ kids _on_ _the_ bus [so] [she] [you] [know] goes in early those days [and] [works] _like_ [you] [know] noon til close . [uh] [so] we [have] 
B|27| M: erm i'm [not] sure . 
A|28| B: yeah [and] being _on_ [a] [you] [know] rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't _be_ anyway _to_ _do_ [that] at all . 
B|29| M: ahhuh ?? 
A|30| B: [and] _i think_ it's kind of neat _to be_ able _to_ spend _the_ afternoons with _the_ kids occasionally too . 
B|31| M: [what] [are you] [on] ? 
A|32| B: [i] mean usually [you] [know] [you] go _to_ work before they're awake or as they're getting up [for] school [and] [you] get home [and] it's already dark unless it's summer time [you] [know .] [and] even in summer time sometimes [you] get home [so] late [that] there's [you] [know] [you] can't _do_ anything with them . 
B|33| M:  
A|34| B: [and] especially in _the_ winter . [i] mean [you] get up in _the_ dark [and] come home in _the_ dark [you] [know .] it's _like_ it's _like_ [a] vampire sometimes 
B|35| M:  ... 
A|36| B: yeah . 
B|37| M: [i think .] [about] . [the] [. you] 
A|38| B: [uh] [a] lot of [i] guess _is_ . 
B|39| M: [what] _do you_ [look] [like] ? 
A|40| B: yeah . [i think] some of _is_ _how the_ [uh] [you] [know] [i] guess it's [not] really [a] direct benefit [but] _how_ your [uh] performance _is_ rated [and] stuff [like] [that] at work . 
B|41| M: [that's not] [how the] study [is] supposed [to be] done . 
A|42| B: cause i've been [uh] especially in large corporations [. you] can really [you] [know] wind up getting having [you] [know] real problems i've found out . i've worked [for a] few [you] [know] several thousand plus [you] [know] type companies . [and] it [and] especially if you're doing [like] professional work . where [you] [know] it's kind of ethereal as [to] [what] you're doing [you] [know .] 
B|43| M: i'm . 
A|44| B: if you're [like] i've [i] work with [uh] computer systems [a] lot [. so] it's kind of hard [to] say [you] [know .] if you're [you] [know] [a] brick layer somebody can [look] [and] see [you] [know] [well] yeah [you] laid [you] [know] fifteen thousand bricks today [and] they were all straight [and] your building didn't fall down [you] [know] yeah [you] did [a] [great] [job .] [but] if [you] build computer systems [like] [well] [you] [know] [what] does [that] computer program really [do you] [know .] or especially if [you] write [like] papers [you] [know .] or [do] design studies or something . 
B|45| M:  
A|46| B: it's real hard [to] rate something [like] [that] . 
B|47| M:  
A|48| B: it's [like] get [a] painter [you] [know] or something [a] artist . it's [like] [well] [you] [how] [do you] really rate [you] [know] michelangelo [you] [know] [how] would [you] tell if he was [you] [know] really [good] or so-so or whatever
