B|0| M: sorry 
A|1| B: uh , it's because _i ,_ _i_ can't find the item _that_ _i_ want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . so _i_ go outside the area for _that_ . and _i_ think _that_ it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania _what_ _they_ believe _they_ are owed even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . _i_ don't , _i_ don't think _that_ that's my responsibility as a , as a conscientious consumer . 
B|2| M: [they] 
A|3| B: well , _i_ think _that_ if , if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then _i_ don't argue with it . because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember _that_ _oh_ , _i_ bought this out of state . _i_ need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania . 
B|4| M: pox . anyways 
A|5| B: right . but the point is is _that_ businesses do _that_ . the business _that_ you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . that's a cost of doing business . the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer . 
B|6| M:  , [what] . [oh] 
A|7| B: uh . 
B|8| M: [that] 
A|9| B: uh , do you mean businesses from the point of view as , of , of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax ? or purchasing . 
B|10| M: [i] 
A|11| B: yeah . see i'm unfamiliar with [that] because [i] don't , [i] never see [that] end of the business . 
B|12| M: [i ,] 
A|13| B: so , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . uh , but , if that's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then [i] think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so [that] , uh , the opportunity to forget [that] you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided . 
B|14| M: n ?
