A|42| B: forty-two cents out [of] every dollar [i] make goes [to] _the government_ _and_ then they charge [me] sales [tax] _and_ they charge [me] gasoline [taxes] 
B|43| M: [how] [much] does [the government] [pay] [you ?] 
A|44| B: _and_ they charge [me] [all] these others _and_ [it's] [just] too expensive . 
B|45| M: _i know_ right ? [it's like] _they're_ not even [trying] . 
A|46| B: [i] can't believe _that_ [i] [i'm just] thankful _that_ _i don't_ get [all] [the government] _that_ [i] [pay for] .
