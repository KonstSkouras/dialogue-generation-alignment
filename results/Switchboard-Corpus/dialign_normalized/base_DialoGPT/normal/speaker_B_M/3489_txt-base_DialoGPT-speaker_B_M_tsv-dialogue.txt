B|11| M: oh [, well ,] um [, i] _like_ [to] [live] [my] life .

A|20| B: hopefully , _it's not_ [my] wife . 
B|21| M: [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|22| B: [well [,] i] thought i'd _, you know ,_ i'd use _it_ as [a] , _an_ escapement type thing _. [i_ don't know] _if you're_ familiar with [that] operation _, but_ , _what_ [you] _do_ _is_ [you] _just_ [build] up [the] pressure

A|24| B: _and_ _then_ [you] _go_ over _and_ release _it_ _and_ _then it_ _just ,_ _it_ _just_ drops _, you [know_ .] 
B|25| M: [but] [then _it] won't_ , it'll [just [,] uh ,] [just] drop 
A|26| B: _very_ similar , yeah . 
B|27| M: _like_ [a] [hydraulic] pump ? 
A|28| B: [well ,] _what_ , _what_ [it] _will_ _be_ _, you_ [just _,] you_ drive up _on the_ jack _, but_ [you] , [it won't] _go down ._

A|38| B: [well ,] anytime they send me [a] return envelope [i] put _all that_ stuff back _in the_ envelope plus [the] other stuff [that] [i] _, you know ,_ happen [to] gather up . 
B|39| M: [what] [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|40| B: because [, uh [,] well ,] [like] [i] _say_ , we [live] [a way] _and_ when [you] throw _trash_ away [, you] throw [it] [in my] yard .

A|42| B: _and_ [i don't] _like that_ 
B|43| M: _he_ sighs . 
A|44| B: so [i don't] [do] _that ._ so [i] take [it] _and_ [i] send , _and_ [i] mail [it] back [to] them . 
B|45| M: [i don't] [have] any [. [i] do] [have] [the] receipt .

B|47| M: you've [had] [a] lot [of] work done 
A|48| B: yeah . [well [,] [i] think] one [of the] , [the] best ways [to] eliminate [, uh ,] [or] help [the] _recycling_ problem _is_ [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
B|49| M: [it] 
A|50| B: _for_ instance [, uh , i] saw [a] thing [on] [, uh ,] nova [, [i] think] [it] was [the] other day . 
B|51| M: ugh [. i] hate [you] 
A|52| B: _this_ guy has _designed_ recyclable materials [, i] [mean] recyclable items . 
B|53| M: [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|54| B: whatever [he] makes , [it's] [all] [out of the] same thing . 
B|55| M: [i think] [he] meant [to] [say] [that] [he] [designed] [it] 
A|56| B: see , so , _plastic_ , [it's] [all] [out of] _plastic_ . 
B|57| M: no _. it's_ [a] [plastic] recycler . 
A|58| B: [if] [it's] _metal_ , [it's] [all] [out of] _metal [._ it's] _, he's_ [a] design _, he's_ [a] engineer , designing stuff . 
B|59| M: [it's not] [metal .] 
A|60| B: _and ,_ _and ,_ incorporating _, you know ,_ reusable materials into your _, uh , you know ,_ your assembly line into your actual scheme [of] product operations _is_ _is_ [the] only [way to] really [do] [it] [on] [a] , [on] [a] broad scale . 
B|61| M: [i] [like] [this] [idea [,] but] [it] [is] [very] , [very] impractical . 
A|62| B: make [it] financially [, uh ,] attractive [to] recycle 
B|63| M: [but] [the] question [is] , why ? 
A|64| B: _and_ somebody _will find_ [a way to] make money at [it .] 
B|65| M: [and [, uh ,] you know [,] recycling] . 
A|66| B: [and ,] 
B|67| M: [the] people [will find] [another] [way] . 
A|68| B: [well ,] there [is] [a] guy _in dallas_ [, that's] [all] [he] does . 
B|69| M: [i don't] [think] [i've] [ever] seen someone [in the] us [say] anything [like [that] .] 
A|70| B: [he] collects [trash] . [you know ,] [and ,] 
B|71| M: [what] [is] [he] doing [in dallas] ?
