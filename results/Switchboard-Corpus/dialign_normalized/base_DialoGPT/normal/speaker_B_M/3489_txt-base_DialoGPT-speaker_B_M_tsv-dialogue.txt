A|0| B: yeah _uh i_ was 
B|1| M:  
A|2| B: _my_ community _that's_ cute _. i_ _live_ _in_ _a_ place called _dye_ mound . 
B|3| M:  
A|4| B: _or dye_ community . 
B|5| M: [or dye] tribe . 
A|6| B: _and_ _it's not_ _a_ city _not_ incorporated _my_ nearest neighbor's about _a_ half _a_ mile at least _i can't even_ see their house _and uh_ 
B|7| M: they're _in my_ neighborhood . 
A|8| B: yeah _i_ _mean_ _uh_ _i'm_ _out_ [in] _i'm_ _out_ _in the_ wilderness . literally . 
B|9| M: [i'm] [a] dog . 
A|10| B: _and uh_ _well_ give _you_ _an_ _idea_ _it's_ three _and_ [a] half miles _of_ dirt road _to_ _the_ concrete _i_ _mean_ _to_ _the_ asphalt we're _out_ there . 
B|11| M: oh [well] um [i] _like_ [to] [live] [my] life . 
A|12| B: _and uh_ we _i do_ some interesting _recycling_ things . 
B|13| M: [i'm] [not] sure [uh _i] don't _know_ ._ 
A|14| B: [i'm] building our house _right_ now _and_ [i'm] _going to_ incorporate into [my] [uh] garage area [a] _weight_ activated [uh] crusher . 
B|15| M:  ... [well] good . 
A|16| B: so when [i] drive _the car_ _in the_ _in the_ driveway _in the_ afternoon _it_ _it_ _will_ _just_ drive _it_ up _on_ _a ramp_ _that_ actually puts me _on_ top _of the_ _the_ [uh] pressure side _of a_ [uh] _hydraulic_ cylinder . 
B|17| M: how are [you] [going to] _build_ [the car] ? 
A|18| B: _and_ _the weight_ _of [the_ car] _will_ crush what's _ever_ _in the_ disposer . 
B|19| M: [it's] [the weight] [that] matters . 
A|20| B: hopefully _it's not_ [my] wife . 
B|21| M: [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|22| B: [well] [i] thought i'd _you know_ i'd use _it_ as [a] _an_ escapement type thing _. [i_ don't know] _if you're_ familiar with [that] operation _but what_ [you] _do_ _is_ [you] _just_ [build] up [the] pressure 
B|23| M: [that's] [not] [an] escape [that's] [a ramp] . 
A|24| B: _and_ _then_ [you] _go_ over _and_ release _it_ _and_ _then it_ _just_ _it_ _just_ drops _you [know_ .] 
B|25| M: [but] [then _it] won't_ it'll [just] [uh] [just] drop 
A|26| B: _very_ similar yeah . 
B|27| M: _like_ [a] [hydraulic] pump ? 
A|28| B: [well] _what_ _what_ [it] _will_ _be_ [you] [just] [you] drive up _on the_ jack [but] [you] [it won't] _go down ._ 
B|29| M: [i] [know] [but what] [will] [it] [be] ? 
A|30| B: until [you] pull [the] pin yeah . 
B|31| M: [if you're] driving [on the] [right] [you] can [go down .] 
A|32| B: anyway _i have_ _another_ [uh] _recycling_ method [i] use . 
B|33| M: _i think_ [you're] [going to] [have] [to] _get_ [that] _out of the_ _way_ [my] friend . 
A|34| B: _you know_ _all that_ junk mail [you] [get] ? 
B|35| M: [i can't even] _think_ [of _a] way to_ [get] _it ._ 
A|36| B: [the] glossy paper [that] says buy _this_ _and_ send off _for_ [that] _and_ [you] [have] won _and_ _all _that_ ._ 
B|37| M: yes [i have] . 
A|38| B: [well] anytime they send me [a] return envelope [i] put _all that_ stuff back _in the_ envelope plus [the] other stuff [that] [i] _you know_ happen [to] gather up . 
B|39| M: [what] [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|40| B: because [uh] [well] [like] [i] _say_ we [live] [a way] _and_ when [you] throw _trash_ away [you] throw [it] [in my] yard . 
B|41| M: why are [you] putting [all that] garbage [in the] [trash] can ? 
A|42| B: _and_ [i don't] _like that_ 
B|43| M: _he_ sighs . 
A|44| B: so [i don't] [do] _that ._ so [i] take [it] _and_ [i] send _and_ [i] mail [it] back [to] them . 
B|45| M: [i don't] [have] any [. [i] do] [have] [the] receipt . 
A|46| B: _i've_ _had_ four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
B|47| M: you've [had] [a] lot [of] work done 
A|48| B: yeah . [well] [i think] one [of the] [the] best ways [to] eliminate [uh] [or] help [the] _recycling_ problem _is_ [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
B|49| M: [it] 
A|50| B: _for_ instance [uh i] saw [a] thing [on] [uh] nova [i think] [it] was [the] other day . 
B|51| M: ugh [. i] hate [you] 
A|52| B: _this_ guy has _designed_ recyclable materials [i] [mean] recyclable items . 
B|53| M: [i'm] [not] sure . 
A|54| B: whatever [he] makes [it's] [all] [out of the] same thing . 
B|55| M: [i think] [he] meant [to] [say] [that] [he] [designed] [it] 
A|56| B: see so _plastic_ [it's] [all] [out of] _plastic_ . 
B|57| M: no _. it's_ [a] [plastic] recycler . 
A|58| B: [if] [it's] _metal_ [it's] [all] [out of] _metal [._ it's] _he's_ [a] design _he's_ [a] engineer designing stuff . 
B|59| M: [it's not] [metal .] 
A|60| B: _and_ _and_ incorporating _you know_ reusable materials into your _uh you know_ your assembly line into your actual scheme [of] product operations _is_ _is_ [the] only [way to] really [do] [it] [on] [a] [on] [a] broad scale . 
B|61| M: [i] [like] [this] [idea] [but] [it] [is] [very] [very] impractical . 
A|62| B: make [it] financially [uh] attractive [to] recycle 
B|63| M: [but] [the] question [is] why ? 
A|64| B: _and_ somebody _will find_ [a way to] make money at [it .] 
B|65| M: [and [uh] you know] [recycling] . 
A|66| B: [and] 
B|67| M: [the] people [will find] [another] [way] . 
A|68| B: [well] there [is] [a] guy _in dallas_ [that's] [all] [he] does . 
B|69| M: [i don't] [think] [i've] [ever] seen someone [in the] us [say] anything [like [that] .] 
A|70| B: [he] collects [trash] . [you know] [and] 
B|71| M: [what] [is] [he] doing [in dallas] ? 
A|72| B: yeah [well] _he's_ _he's_ [out] _for_ cardboard .
