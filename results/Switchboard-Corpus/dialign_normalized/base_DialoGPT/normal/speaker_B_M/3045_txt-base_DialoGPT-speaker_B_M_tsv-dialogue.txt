B|83| M: [oh . i] am ? 
A|84| B: [i'm] [and] [they] [just] talked [to] [the other] day [other] day [about] setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon [we'll] _at_ [least] [have] [the] word processing . 
B|85| M: [oh .] [well] [yeah .] 
A|86| B: [my] nine year old [i've] decided [to] teach her [how] _to type_ using [the computer] 
B|87| M: [well] [what] [is] [it] ? 
A|88| B: so . 
B|89| M: [i'm not] good [at] [typing] .

A|96| B: uh-huh . [yeah .] 
B|97| M: [uh] [what] ? 
A|98| B: we've [been] we've [been] [uh] writing _a story_ together . 
B|99| M: [he] smiles [and] nods . 
A|100| B: [and] so [i] [and] [i] wanted her [to] put [it] into [the [computer] and] then print _it out_ [and] _make a_ book [with] [it] [you know] . 
B|101| M: [what] ? 
A|102| B: [and] so [i] decided [well] if [she's] [going to] [do] [that] [it] would [be] [a] whole lot easier if _she_ could [type] 
B|103| M: [oh .] [she] could've [just] typed [it out] . 
A|104| B: so [we'll] slowly [learn] [just] _to type_ here [and] then then put [the] _story_ [in] . 
B|105| M: [i've been] told by others [to] [make [a] story] . 
A|106| B: [yes] [yes] [. _i] agree ._ 
B|107| M: [i agree .] [she] [can] still [learn] [to type] . 
A|108| B: [yeah .]
