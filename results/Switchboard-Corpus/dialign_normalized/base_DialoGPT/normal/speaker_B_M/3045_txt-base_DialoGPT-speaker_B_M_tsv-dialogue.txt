A|98| B: we've [been] , we've [been] [, uh ,] writing _a story_ together . 
B|99| M: [he] smiles [and] nods . 
A|100| B: [and] so [i [,] and] [i] wanted her [to] put [it] into [the computer] [, and] then print _it out_ [and] , _make a_ book [with] [it] [, [you] know] . 
B|101| M: [what] ? 
A|102| B: [and] so [i] decided [well ,] if [she's] [going to] [do] [that ,] [it] would [be] [a] whole lot easier if _she_ could [type] 
B|103| M: [oh .] [she] could've [just] typed [it out] . 
A|104| B: so [we'll] slowly [learn] [just] _to type_ here [and] then then put [the] _story_ [in] . 
B|105| M: [i've been] told by others [to] [make [a] story] . 
A|106| B: [yes ,] [yes] [. _i] agree ._ 
B|107| M: [i agree .] [she] [can] still [learn] [to type] . 
A|108| B: [yeah .] 
B|109| M: [she] shrugs . [i've been] [in] [a] relationship [for] [a] while .
