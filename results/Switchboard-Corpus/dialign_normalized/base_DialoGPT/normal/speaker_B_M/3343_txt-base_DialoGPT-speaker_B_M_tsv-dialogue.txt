A|0| B: it's _you know_ it's _a_ game _to_ her _but_ _i i_ do _not_ like _to_ do _that_ _i_ consider _it_ kind _of_ _a_ _a_ waste _of_ my _time_ . _and_ _so_ _i'm_ usually _uh_ _pretty_ careful when _i_ shop 
B|1| M: [i] see . 
A|2| B: _and_ [i] also _you know_ usually _have_ _have_ checked over things _you know_ if it's like _an_ appliance or _something_ _to_ make _sure_ _uh_ _it_ has _the_ features _in_ _it_ _that_ [i] want . 
B|3| M: [so] [uh] 
A|4| B: now we've had one lately um _oh_ _a_ [uh] _a_ dustbuster plus _that_ _we_ bought 
B|5| M: _well_ 
A|6| B: _and_ we've had _it_ for _a_ while _but_ all _of_ _a_ sudden _it_ just wasn't working _and_ _it_ looks like _there's_ _a_ part missing from _it ._ my husband opened _it_ up _and_ whatever _and_ _of_ course _we_ don't _have the_ _receipt_ any more [so] _we_ _can't_ take _it_ back 
B|7| M:  ... 
A|8| B: _uh but_ [i] think _a_ lot _of_ goods _are_ made _not_ _to_ last real long 
B|9| M: uhhh _you're_ right . 
A|10| B: [uh] 
B|11| M: [uh but] _they_ [have] [a] [receipt] 
A|12| B: yeah . 
B|13| M: [so] _you're_ saying _you could_ [have the] entire _thing_ done [in] 5 _years_ ? 
A|14| B: [well] _that's_ true _and_ lot _of_ times though _it_ _is_ _it_ costs [so] much _to_ get _something_ fixed _that_ [you] almost _are_ just as [well] off buying another one _you know_ if it's 
B|15| M: [we] [are] [the] best _at_ [something] . [we] [are] [the] only ones who _can_ afford [to] _buy a_ new _car_ [and] [we] [are] [the] worst _at_ [it .] 
A|16| B: uh-huh . 
B|17| M: _they_ [are] [the] most expensive ones [in] [the] 
A|18| B: [well] yeah [i] think [a] lot _of_ times if [you] get [a] brand name [uh] _you know_ if it's [a] [a] good brand 
B|19| M: _why_ 
A|20| B: [i] [you] [i] think _there's_ _there_ [can] _be_ [a] _lemon in_ anything [but] [uh] [i] think more often than _not_ 
B|21| M: [there's] no [lemon in] _that ._ 
A|22| B: [you] [you] _pretty_ [well] _know_ _what_ [you're] getting ahead _of time_ [and] [uh] _you know_ if [you] [buy a] good one [you] shouldn't [have] any _you know_ too much _of_ [a] problem with [it] 
B|23| M: [you] [uh] [you're] [a] genius . 
A|24| B: [i] mean [we] [we] had [a] [car] once [that] [we] tried [to] [have] declared [a] [lemon] under _the lemon_ law which _is_ extremely difficult [to] do . 
B|25| M: ohh [i] thought [you] were talking about [the lemon] . 
A|26| B: [we] never [could] get [it] declared [a] [lemon] [and] [the] [car] would go [and] without any warning whatsoever [you could] _be_ _going_ down [the] freeway [at] sixty [and] [it] would stop 
B|27| M: [you] [can't] 
A|28| B: [and] [i] _there_ _was_ just _you know_ [and] _oh_ [we] went round [and] round with [the] manufacturer [and] [and] everything [and] [they] got [it] finally semifixed [but] _it was_ such [a] hassle 
B|29| M: [oh] [you] [there] were no 
A|30| B: yeah yeah [it] [it] really _is_ [uh but] gee _this_ _is_ _of_ all [the] topics [i] [have] had _i'm_ doing _this_ [thing] _this_ _is_ kind _of_ [the] strangest one . 
B|31| M: [i] am 
A|32| B: uh-huh . 
B|33| M: _that ._ 
A|34| B: [well] [i] think _that's_ true [and] [i] [uh] now [we] generally don't [buy a] warranty because [you] think _you know_ [at] least for [the] first couple _of_ [years] nothing should go wrong with [it .] 
B|35| M: [not] _. [i_ [i] i] [and] . 
A|36| B: uh-huh . uh-huh . uh-huh . 
B|37| M: [you're] welcome ! 
A|38| B: [i] think technology _is_ better _i'm_ _i'm_ [not] _sure_ [. i] think you've got [a] good _point_ with [the] plastic [and] [that .] 
B|39| M: [you] . 
A|40| B: [i] don't think necessarily [that] things [are] being made better [uh] _you know_ 
B|41| M: [i] 
A|42| B: [i i] everything _is_ [so] automated [uh] [and] things [can] _be_ made without [i] think [a] human hand ever touching [it] _you know_ _an_ awful lot _of_ things 
B|43| M: [what] [is] [the] [point] [of] [this] ? 
A|44| B: [and] [i] think [that] certainly makes [a] difference from back from [the] _time_ when somebody handcrafted [something] [and] _you know_ had some pride [in] [it .] 
B|45| M: [it was] done [in] [an] art program . 
A|46| B: [well] yeah _that's_ _that's_ true . 
B|47| M: [you know] [i'm] [pretty] [sure] [the] amount [of time] [that's] [going] [to] [be] spent 
A|48| B: yeah [well] [i i] do [uh] [you know] craft work [and] sell stuff [at] shows [and] [that] [and] [uh] [uh] [you know] it's it's it's [a] real eye-opener as far as [you know] [why] people charge [what] [they] do [to] [you know] .
