B|9| M: _well_ _it's_ _autumn ._ 
A|10| B: but uh [we] had uh _you_ know all these [we] have all these uh somebody said _you_ know _you're_ either [a] stranger or [a] fool to try to predict texas weather but . [well] always they were saying _it_ was going to be _the_ hottest summer ever 
B|11| M: uuuh yoo _it ._ 
A|12| B: _and_ [we] had all _this_ rain _and_ [it] really _is_ _not_ [a] _bad_ summer at all really cool . but all [of] [a] sudden _in_ _in_ uh _in_ [october] uh september [october] [it] [got] real hot _and_ dry _and_ just stayed _that_ way for [a] long time . _and_ uh then _the_ end [of] [october] [it] started rain almost [a] week without stopping just pouring down _you_ know . there were flash floods everywhere _that_ kind [of] deal _and_ then uh into [of] november _the_ first _like_ _the_ second week uh _you_ know _the_ first week actually [we] had [we] had [a] freeze

B|21| M: _i'm_ [so] glad [i] live [in] arizona . 
A|22| B: [it's] just kind [of] uh [we're] supposed to have [a] chance to get some rain _the_ next couple [of] days [here] uh which will be [you] know [a little] bit more typical uh [autumn] weather . but really [it's] strange . [we] haven't really had an [autumn [.] it's] _like_ [we] went into winter 
B|23| M: _so ._ 
A|24| B: [you] know _the_ poor _trees_ said [what] 
B|25| M: [this] [is _it] ._ 
A|26| B: _yeah_ uh [it's] _yeah_ there [you] [you] know usually there's uh [i] have [a] farm [a] hundred miles east [of] [here] [in] east texas [and] [you] know all these huge _trees_ just _like_ _the_ eastern hard wood belt all _the_ way up to maine [you] know [it's] _that_ _same_ _trees_ pines [and] [and] hard woods [you] know hickories [and] oaks [and] stuff 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: [and] uh [i] was up there last weekend [and] there _are_ _trees_ _that_ _that_ still have their leaves on [and] they're green but they're dead [you] know _the_ _the_ freeze just [got] them . they they weren't ready for [it] at all apparently [and] [and] [we] haven't had [a] typical fall at all . _not_ much color [you] know changes have occurred at all . really [weird] [this year .] [i'm] _not_ sure [what] _that_ [what] _that_ means . 
B|29| M: [i] . 
A|30| B: [so] [you] [you] all actually had some color huh ? 
B|31| M:  
A|32| B: [it] kind [of] crept [in] [and] 
B|33| M: we've [been a] lot [of] [course] yea [of] [like] [yeah] [a] lot . 
A|34| B: [yeah] [it's] usually beautiful up there isn't _it ?_ 
B|35| M: [we] [we did] . 
A|36| B: gorgeous . [that's] [you] know [i think] [you] could drive along [in] maryland [and] look at _the_ sweet gum _trees_ on each side [and] _the_ [and] _the_ pines [and] [what] _not_ [and] [you] could [you] know [you] could be driving along [in] east texas [and] looks just _the same [._ it's] almost [you] know identical kind [of] country . 
B|37| M: [i think] [you're] right . 
A|38| B: beautiful . 
B|39| M: [what's] [the] difference between [a] car [and] [a] car ? 
A|40| B: [yeah] . [oh] . [yeah] [i] was up [i] was up there cutting some firewood [this] weekend [so .]

A|42| B: [little] [little] oak tree _that_ was dead [and] _cut it_ up [and] split [it .] 
B|43| M: how'd [you] [cut [it] ?] 
A|44| B: [well] . 
B|45| M: [it's not] [that] [bad] . 
A|46| B: uh [it] there's some [trees] [like] [the] oaks [like] [the] white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . there's nothing bothers them . their leaves [are] still green [and] some [of] [the] other oaks . there [are] [a] few oaks [that] have lost their leaves . um [what] [i] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [that] [the] leaves [are] just dead [the] dogwoods still look still look [you] know they [got] uh bit on [the] ends [of] [the] leaves [a little] bit but they still look pretty good . 
B|47| M:  
A|48| B: [it] just depends on [the] on [the] uh on [the] tree .
