A:	Well, tell me about your home.
B:	Okay. Uh, right now we're living in, well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys. And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So we don't have a, a big yard. Uh, but, uh, when my wife and I first moved in, it was just the two of us. So it was enough.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
A:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
A:	Huh.
B:	And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
A:	It sounds nice.
B:	It's, uh, pretty nice. Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Yeah. It was a, Landmark is the one who built it.
A:	Yeah. Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
B:	Yeah. That's true.
A:	And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
B:	Exactly what happened to them.
A:	I'm building my own house.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
B:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Are you doing it yourself?
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wow.
A:	I used to be a builder.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
B:	Oh, I see. Huh.
A:	And now I'm a college educated builder There's still no work, you know.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did.
B:	That's great.
A:	And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
B:	is that so? I didn't know that.
A:	You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
B:	Well that sounds kind of dumb.
A:	Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Well.
B:	Huh.
A:	As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?
B:	That's right
A:	Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to.
B:	Uh-huh. That's good.
A:	Yeah. Well, I figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so I want  to have a shop.
B:	Yeah. How big a lot do you got it on?
A:	Ten acres.
B:	Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.
A:	Well, yeah. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill.
B:	Oh.
A:	And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. Seriously.
B:	God. That's pretty good.
A:	Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy but, you know, he's
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
B:	Oh, that's pretty good.
A:	Yeah. Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
A:	Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I have not had to use the heat.
B:	Wow.
A:	Because it's all geothermal.
B:	Yeah. That's pretty good.
A:	And with all the, see I've got, on the south side is all glass. Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. So it's almost all glass.
B:	Wow.
A:	And, uh,
B:	My wife would love that
A:	Oh, yeah. I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
B:	She loves lots of windows. That's great.
A:	So, uh,
B:	Is it a single story?
A:	Well, not really. It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
B:	Oh, I see.
A:	So the first, you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
B:	Uh-huh. Um, I see.
A:	And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
B:	Oh.
A:	So I've got a pretty good grade there.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
A:	Exactly.
B:	Yeah. I, I've always liked that. The, you know, I, we don't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
