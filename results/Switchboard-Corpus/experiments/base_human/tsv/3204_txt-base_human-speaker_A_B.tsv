B:	What is it about, nursing homes?
A:	well, about nursing homes, and, and older people.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they're just really close here. And his mother has bad health too and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
B:	Right.
A:	And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe. It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
B:	Oh, it's very difficult I know.
A:	Uh, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not you know, unrealistic.
B:	Right.
A:	Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I, uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
B:	Yeah, how old is she?
A:	She's ninety-two.
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
A:	Oh, I think that's wonderful.
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
A:	Well, Uh-huh.
B:	I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
A:	Yeah. I was just going to say.
B:	They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
A:	Yeah. Um,
B:	And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
A:	Yes.
B:	So,
A:	Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
B:	Right.
A:	And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves. Um,
B:	Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
A:	Yeah, yeah
B:	So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh,
A:	Yeah.
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
A:	Nursing homes.
B:	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
A:	Visit.
B:	I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
A:	They don't go and see them. That's right.
B:	They never go to see them.
A:	That's right.
B:	I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.
A:	You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have to say that.
B:	Right.
A:	But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
B:	Oh, I do too.
A:	Um,
B:	Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
A:	Right, right.
B:	Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
A:	I hope so.
B:	Anyway.
A:	You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
B:	Right. Oh, it's tough I'm sure.
A:	And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
B:	Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.
A:	And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision I think.
B:	It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
A:	Uh-huh. I think that's right,
B:	Yeah.
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
B:	Right.
A:	Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that might be a partial solution, or something.
B:	Right.
A:	But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,
B:	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Well, anyway,
A:	Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.
B:	We've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
A:	Good to hear from you.
B:	Have a good,
A:	Have a lovely day.
B:	Have a good
