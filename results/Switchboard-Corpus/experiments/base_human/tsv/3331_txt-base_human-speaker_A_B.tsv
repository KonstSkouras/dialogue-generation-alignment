A:	Well, what I believe is one of the major uh, things that is wrong with our public school system is that, um, we do not have enough discipline
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I agree with that.
A:	Uh, when I went to school, I know I was scared to death about being disciplined,
B:	You were?
A:	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	You know, you just, you did not see, I did not see anybody in my classrooms, when I was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, yeah. From what I understand, they act up pretty bad
A:	Yeah, that's right, that's right.
B:	What, uh, grade is your daughter in?
A:	My, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.
A:	and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
B:	Oh, no, uh-huh. They always had a paddle in our school.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, they, they just don't do that any more.
B:	I know.
A:	But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
A:	And, I also believe we don't, even though I feel like I pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, I think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
B:	Yeah. Wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?
A:	Yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know, I don't know your feelings toward that. I guess we shouldn't get into that but, um, and what else, um, I think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have heard stories, uh, from other parents that I know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
B:	Uh-huh. No. Really?
A:	Oh, yeah,
B:	Ooh.
A:	I've, I've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
B:	Uh-huh. Um.
A:	Um, that's basically about all that I know that may be wrong with the school system. I think, with what they have to work with, I think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
B:	Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job.
A:	Uh-huh, so.
B:	But, then, what do I know, I don't have any kids. No, none at all
A:	Yeah, okay, so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
B:	Oh, yeah
A:	Yeah. Okay, well, I guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.
B:	Okay.
A:	It was a joy in talking with you.
B:	Well, it was good talking to you too.
A:	Okay, thanks.
B:	We'll see you, bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
