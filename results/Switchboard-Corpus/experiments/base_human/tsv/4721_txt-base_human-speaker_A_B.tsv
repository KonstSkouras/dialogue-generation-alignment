A:	You want to go first
B:	Well, uh, no I I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or as I would like to, uh, uh, these days. I, seems to be to easy to get busy with other things. Uh, I have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run, and every, every January and every September, I start out again and then it tapers off
A:	Really?
B:	Uh, what about you?
A:	Well, yeah, I do a lot of exercise. Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which I absolutely love. Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years and I wanted to get it back off
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really made me feel good.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.
B:	Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,
A:	It is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
B:	Okay.
A:	It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and I'm, I'm getting much better. My stamina is getting great for the dance floor so  I mean it's just,
B:	Yeah.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
B:	Well, uh, okay. Now that's inside again, right?
A:	It is inside and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
B:	But,
A:	and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
B:	Do, do you like to do it with other people. I mean like the, the jazzercise would be?
A:	I have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	So I've enjoyed that part of it. Yeah. And at the gym, even in the class, uh, I, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. Everybody's on their way to someplace
B:	Right.
A:	and so, you know, I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
B:	But,
A:	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so.
B:	Yeah, right. Right. But still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.
A:	There are, there are. It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah.
B:	In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.
A:	You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V but you probably wouldn't.
B:	Yeah.
A:	So.
B:	Yeah, uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
A:	Yeah.
B:	I, I've, one thing, when, when I have run and jogged, uh, I've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do, I, I've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, I write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. The, it's
A:	Yeah, yeah, I can see it'll be a good break.
B:	The the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
A:	Right.
B:	and I find that I can often, you know, often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work
A:	Uh-huh
B:	and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working and I, I go back and I've got new ideas, but still .
A:	I think you do. You feel very good after you exercise. I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
B:	Yeah.
A:	You owe it to yourself
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, I think it's well worth it. I just demand that time for myself. Now I've learned to do that
B:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around. So.
B:	Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself. That you've just got to   you've just got to
A:	You have to. Because   there's always more things to do.
B:	Right.
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
B:	Yeah.
A:	and I take it so.
B:	Well good, well good. Well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging? I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, uh, club.
A:	No, I've done some walking with friends in the past.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
B:	Yeah.
A:	and that's not really beneficial, so, uh I don't have time like that
B:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
