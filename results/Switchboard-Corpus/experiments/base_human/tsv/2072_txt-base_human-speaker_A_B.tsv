A:	All righty . Uh, I'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
B:	Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts and, uh, I've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and, all that kind of stuff.
A:	Oh like typing noises in
B:	And I enjoy it, it's relaxing. And you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on. And I play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else's ears because I'm not that good at it, but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while.
A:	Oh really?
B:	How about yourself?
A:	Well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz, I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have time to deal with them.
B:	Really?
A:	I like photography a lot,
B:	Oh, yeah, that's neat.
A:	uh, I used to do that a lot and then I like, um, we have a new child that will be a year old here next week, so I'll take a lot of pictures of her, you know, and spoil them,

A:	first one, you know how that is. And, um, uh, I play the guitar and a banjo. I mainly play the guitar a lot, I play about every night. And, um, I really love that, if I had a druther , if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something, because that's, I've,
B:	Oh, that sounds nice. I like bluegrass, too.
A:	yeah, I've done it before and when I was in in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it,

B:	It is. It really is.
A:	Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty, yeah.
B:	Yeah, exactly. I like things that, you know, two people can do, but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know, kind of gives you some space for yourself, and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create, and I like to crochet and knit. I made some afghans and that kind of stuff. I like doing things with my hands.

B:	We did, I did horseback riding, too, in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses and, uh, that was kind of for them, but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, we always had horses around, and I really enjoyed that,
