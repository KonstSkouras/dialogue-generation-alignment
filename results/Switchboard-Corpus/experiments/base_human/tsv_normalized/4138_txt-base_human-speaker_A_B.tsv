A:	think about uh taxes.
B:	well i think they're a necessary evil. uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh you you don't spend more than you than you bring in.
A:	you spend what you have and yeah i think that the general idea is to you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they're running under the you know the way they're running it now they're you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe but so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay you know get what you pay for.
B:	well i it just depends. uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living.
A:	yeah. there's
B:	so i think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
A:	uh-huh. i agree with that.
B:	but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
A:	i guess i'm i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored. i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long. my parents i guess however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back. i will this year anyway from a
B:	uh you're very fortunate.
A:	yeah i am i need it too otherwise
B:	we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount. uh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	we don't regret paying taxes. we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay.
A:	more taxes you pay.
B:	it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.
A:	uh-huh. isn't
B:	uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
A:	wow.
B:	now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there even though there's uh taxes on different things.
A:	uh-huh. well isn't
B:	but you know there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax.
A:	uh-huh there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes.
B:	you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank.
A:	uh-huh. the taxes that people don't think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess.
B:	but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
A:	uh-huh. there was that which was it jerry brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a i think a flat percentage something like that.
B:	yeah if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
A:	right. exactly. that's because until like eight
B:	and so based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer.
A:	up until like eighty-five or something was the
