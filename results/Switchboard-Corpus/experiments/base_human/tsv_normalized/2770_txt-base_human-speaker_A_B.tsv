B:	so have you got a pet.
A:	no i don't an my kids would love a pet. i had a pet when i was a girl. i had a cocker spaniel. and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company.
B:	yeah
A:	you can you can tell them anything and they won't tell anybody.
B:	that's right that's like unconditional affection.
A:	right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love. they just give it and don't expect too much.
B:	yeah.
A:	anyway do you have a pet?
B:	i had a cat i've had several cats. my pet uh was hit by a car new year's eve but uh
A:	oh! like a
B:	i'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town. i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm going to find a cat. so
A:	oh i'm so sorry. but that's good that you're going to get another one.
B:	yeah.
A:	i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really you know the ones that have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets. but they just um really take care of them or uh are protective of them.
B:	i work and go to school and it's kind of nice you come home your your pet's there for you and wants a little food a little attention.
A:	yeah an and my my kids
B:	and that's it's kind of fun.
A:	um they really want a dog badly and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think
B:	yeah.
A:	but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat.
B:	no it was an kind of indoor outdoor it it was
A:	it kind of traveled around travel .
B:	well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of the litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when .
A:	yeah when i had a cocker spaniel it it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better.
B:	yeah i i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm kind of like big big dogs and you have to have room for them.
A:	yeah that's true.
B:	and dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do. cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.
A:	yeah that's true. take them for walks right. yeah i see all the people on on sunday going for a walk with their dogs and and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe
B:	yeah.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it or something. so i
B:	yeah i got to take care of a friend of mine's dog. he's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it was go over there and clean up after the dog
A:	oh that's exciting. yeah.
B:	and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work.
A:	yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them.
B:	yeah.
A:	that that kind of gripes on me some but but i don't know.
B:	well if you're if you're going to have a pet  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring
A:	more and more people are right right.
B:	and and i think you know
A:	but uh
B:	when i was growing up we had cats and you know just seeing the cats you know the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand
A:	i think that's really true.
B:	and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't want to you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know
A:	yeah.
B:	they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them.
A:	yeah exactly.
B:	so.
A:	exactly. i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and and that's good too.
B:	yeah.
A:	well i think that's all i have to say.
B:	okay
A:	okay have a good night. all right bye-bye.
B:	bye.
