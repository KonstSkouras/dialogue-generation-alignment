A:	well, tell me about your home.
B:	okay. uh, right now we're living in, well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys. and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. which you might call it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so we don't have a, a big yard. uh, but, uh, when my wife and i first moved in, it was just the two of us. so it was enough.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, and it's, uh, i guess what they call a story and a half. because it's not a full two story. where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
A:	yeah.
B:	so, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
A:	huh.
B:	and, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
A:	it sounds nice.
B:	it's, uh, pretty nice. unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
A:	oh, yeah?
B:	yeah. it was a, landmark is the one who built it.
A:	yeah. well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
B:	yeah. that's true.
A:	and, uh i'm insulating myself from that problem.
B:	exactly what happened to them.
A:	i'm building my own house.
B:	oh, that's nice.
A:	and as i look out the window of my trailer, i can envision all the insulation that's going up today
B:	oh, really.
A:	yeah.
B:	are you doing it yourself?
A:	yeah.
B:	wow.
A:	i used to be a builder.
B:	oh, that's nice.
A:	and i retired about five years ago and  started college.
B:	oh, i see. huh.
A:	and now i'm a college educated builder there's still no work, you know.
B:	yeah.
A:	so, uh, you know, i decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did.
B:	that's great.
A:	and, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
B:	is that so? i didn't know that.
A:	you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
B:	well that sounds kind of dumb.
A:	well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	well.
B:	huh.
A:	as, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. right?
B:	that's right
A:	hence the savings and loan problem we have.
B:	yeah, that's true.
A:	but, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. it's designed to be added on to.
B:	uh-huh. that's good.
A:	yeah. well, i figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so i want  to have a shop.
B:	yeah. how big a lot do you got it on?
A:	ten acres.
B:	wow. that's nice. that's real nice.
A:	well, yeah. it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor. he's on the other side of a hill.
B:	oh.
A:	and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. seriously.
B:	god. that's pretty good.
A:	well, in the winter time, i can see, see another guy but, you know, he's
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i can just make out his place, you know. i've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	and, uh,
B:	oh, that's pretty good.
A:	yeah. well, i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
B:	uh-huh. oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
A:	well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
B:	yeah.
A:	but, in the house itself, i've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i have not had to use the heat.
B:	wow.
A:	because it's all geothermal.
B:	yeah. that's pretty good.
A:	and with all the, see i've got, on the south side is all glass. well, as much as i could get in it, you know. and, uh, the east side is glass.
B:	yeah.
A:	i've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. so it's almost all glass.
B:	wow.
A:	and, uh,
B:	my wife would love that
A:	oh, yeah. i mean, you know.  there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
B:	she loves lots of windows. that's great.
A:	so, uh,
B:	is it a single story?
A:	well, not really. it's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
B:	oh, i see.
A:	so the first, you know, the, the, the, what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
B:	uh-huh. um, i see.
A:	and the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
B:	oh.
A:	so i've got a pretty good grade there.
B:	yeah.
A:	and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, that's kind of like, like a victorian style?
A:	exactly.
B:	yeah. i, i've always liked that. the, you know, i, we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, i, i see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i, i kind of wish i had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck.
