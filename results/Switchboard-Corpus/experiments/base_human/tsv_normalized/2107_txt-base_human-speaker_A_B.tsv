B:	oh no i understand we uh we've gone through the same things with ours we've had you know they've been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know
A:	oh yeah.
B:	my boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy. and then we had a baby and it's like all right who comes first the cat or the baby.
A:	the cat was here first so i know it's hard.
B:	and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.
A:	oh how funny.
B:	it's like all right whose corners is this one.
A:	that's sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats.
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and they're doing great out there they love it. but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	other than that he gets scared to death. if you shut that door he goes into hiding.
B:	oh no.
A:	i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
B:	yes uh-huh that's it
A:	and lord knows what happened to him. he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
B:	right traumatized for life here.
A:	probably.
B:	oh yeah we've all four of ours are house cats.
A:	are they.
B:	we started out with two with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
A:	oh no.
B:	oh well he lived through it oh i couldn't believe it. we went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
A:	oh my gosh.
B:	the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now.
A:	oh i imagine.
B:	and he's like oh thank you so much.
A:	i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened.
B:	i know we wondered about that. but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.
A:	oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with.
B:	uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
A:	oh my gosh. people are crazy.
B:	oh yes absolutely nuts. but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and
A:	oh lord.
B:	i mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
A:	oh man.
B:	but oh he's been a wonderful cat.
A:	i imagine. they usually are after something like that happens to them. it seems to mellow them or something.
B:	oh yes. but uh we wouldn't we wouldn't have them i mean i don't see us without pets without cats.
A:	no.
B:	there's just uh there's this they just fill this void.
A:	oh yeah i i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't i can't take care of them as well because they're outside
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back
B:	yes.
A:	and i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. but i can't give them up.
B:	oh no.
A:	i just i go hysterical when they don't come home.
B:	right and you worry about oh who's taking care of them.
A:	oh oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and you go crazy thinking it might be yours.
B:	right well i didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night. we i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh well i fell in love with this uh it's a chinchilla persian and uh brought him home
A:	ugh!
B:	and oh my husband just died.
A:	really.
B:	it was like we can't take it back you've got we've got to keep it now.
A:	it's here now we have to keep it. yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh yes.
A:	so i found this one and uh actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens.
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	and i thought well that's interesting i'll call them.
B:	right.
A:	and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story.
B:	oh.
A:	so of course i had to take him. i felt so sorry for him after that.
B:	right right.
A:	and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.
B:	oh no.
A:	yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so.
B:	yeah.
A:	but he is the lovingest cat. everybody people who don't even like cats like him.
B:	oh.
A:	he never meows he he doesn't have any front claws i had him declawed
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	but he doesn't bite anybody he's just he's just kind of there real friendly and docile.
B:	oh that's good. oh we just uh just love them. they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's like oh your claws need trimming.
A:	oh yeah yeah we do we call that doing biscuits

B:	oh it just drives us nuts.
A:	oh i just love cats. i like dogs they're okay i had i had a dog when i lived at home
B:	um yeah.
A:	but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.
B:	they really are. the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog.
A:	oh yeah they do.
B:	and but oh they're so much fun to watch them play.
A:	oh they are. i love it it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities.
