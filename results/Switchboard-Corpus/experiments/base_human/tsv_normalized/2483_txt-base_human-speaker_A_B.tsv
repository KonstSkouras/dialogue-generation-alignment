B:	okay .
A:	are you a t i or
B:	no i'm not.
A:	oh really that's great. uh my daughter talked to a student. uh in general most of them uh people doing this are t i but i guess customers too huh?
B:	and i think a great number of students who got word of it and participated in general and voiced who heard about the program.
A:	yeah. t i got uh a lot of advances in it really. uh hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us. we sure need uh the business. okay current events. uh you you've got the question you can go first there since i called.
B:	i rely primarily on uh newspaper combined with television.
A:	huh that you're the opposite of me. i drive an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not say one which quality is the best i guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio and then newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i'll catch the the evening news like ten o'clock on t v and i
B:	uh.
A:	so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.
B:	okay.
A:	i really of course you you're in a different part of the country i i really listen to a lot of the talk shows i don't mean the gossip ones but there's a lot of on the weekends when i do chores or whatever i'm a radio hound i guess i take the radio with me when i'm working on my car the lawn or whatever and turn on they have everything from lawn work lawyers news uh veterinarians all kinds of items uh so i'm i'm a real radio buff especially on the when i'm doing chores.
B:	that's rather interesting.
A:	yeah i find it surprising. because a lot of times it here you know i'll talk to some people here and i'll mention someone's some talk host and i'll expect them to have an opinion on why i don't like him and don't listen they don't even know you know what the guys name is uh. bruce williams who does financial work all over the united states. most people haven't heard of bruce williams. you probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.
B:	i'd i'd have to say i haven't either.
A:	he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire. and he has it i well it's five seventy here i'm trying to it's on cliff i don't know what the he's on all stations. you might remember the name bruce williams and he he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things. but the here i just get a kick out of uh well we do a lot of gardening here so there's we have an excellent gardener here has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday. of course that's not exactly current events. but i i'm i am kind of a radio buff.
B:	i listen to the radio uh probably five or six hours a week but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical uh station here   for music purposes.
A:	for music?
B:	we don't use the radio as a wake up we have our a television connected to a uh uh electronic alarm uh system that kicks in
A:	yeah.
B:	and it comes on with c n n in the morning.
A:	oh yeah. that's good. actually
B:	that we we wake up to television news and uh uh shower and dress and whatever to that and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together uh in a car we we chat at each other rather than than something else.
A:	oh that's good.
B:	uh and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in in the car so we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
A:	my wife always wonders about that she says look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time
B:	so we we rely pretty pretty heavily i think on a combination of the of the two. i also uh use uh newsweek magazine. uh
A:	yeah.
B:	we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the the uh news magazine of the year for us.
A:	right. we get
B:	and uh i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other you know trade magazines and uh uh such as that uh where i might read the the occasional social and even current event commentaries and and everything as diverse as a c m to uh uh some of the uh some of the other tabloids i get. so uh i guess i use about eighty percent written is probably my input and twenty percent uh television. i i think i respect the from a journalistic perspective current events.
A:	go ahead 
B:	i've always said that it it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.
A:	good point. that's a good point.
B:	uh other than that it was a at best.
A:	oh yeah. it comes and goes.
B:	uh we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh. there there are other uh uh i'm not sure what you would call them they the small uh competing independent sort of newspapers. little small weekly things but there's only one daily uh called the news and observer fondly referred to here by some as the uh uh sometimes the noise and observer.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh it depends. it it's has decent national coverage but has an extremely focused political coverage probably steeped in  the southern history and the fact that this is a democratic state.
A:	local you mean?
B:	and uh consequently everything is filtered through that uh republican democratic sort of glass almost unnecessarily
A:	yeah.
B:	so.
A:	yeah. don't they have city council meetings and all that. are you into any of that what what's going on in the city council and the and the school boards and all that? we have that addition to our paper.
B:	yeah we we have that is uh as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section we and we pay it sort of glancing nod. we uh have a very good friend who is uh tapped into the city planning structure. uh our developer architect friend and
A:	okay  you get it from people then.
B:	right. so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
A:	yeah. right.
B:	uh and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than than the paper would have anyway.
A:	my wife and i you know as mentioned the question was uh do you get it from people too. and and i can say the same thing you do that uh my wife is uh she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and say you didn't read the uh well i always read the sports uh what am i thinking of uh the commentaries i can't even think of what it is offhand and she's always reading something and she says why haven't you read that. and i say i never have time to read it like you do. but i always get a lot of my information from the newspaper through her.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	uh so i guess we do get it from people too. oh you mentioned c n n of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news you know?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it's the same thing that's on the radio word for word.
B:	is that right? i'll heard there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to c n n.
A:	yeah
B:	okay.
A:	and it because uh we have it here at work as a matter if fact at t i.
B:	okay.
A:	we have it in the break area c n n. and but the reason i say that is on the radio they'll say and look at this you know. and when i first heard c n n it only started about uh since the war you know or right before that. and they would always say and look at this and there would be a pause you know would be music and stuff and i realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the uh the news.
B:	oh that didn't uh
A:	yeah yeah. but it's still good. it's still uh uh you know you don't really miss anything.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but i do do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too as well as watching c n n on t v here at work. i don't have c n n at home. let me turn this radio off i'm actually at work right now believe it or not. uh where was i i'm go ahead your your turn.
B:	uh we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began. uh we almost live and and breathed it for because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done.
A:	yeah i've i've heard that yeah.
B:	uh almost an addition uh and and and we could equate or relate relay well to some of the newspaper and television articles about the fact that people where having this problem in in unhooking uncoupling from the events and going on with their. so
A:	right
B:	instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. uh and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news. we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch uh a rotating network news of either uh a b c c b s or n b c and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.
A:	right.
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on on news that way. and then we would do a similar thing uh at uh ten forty-five because uh c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage uh and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. uh three of the networks here on their local news uh that if if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what. from whom.
A:	oh yeah.
B:	and that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best mumblex and not news
A:	yeah.
B:	unless there's some trend or something that says jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever. uh that's that's sort of more of of a pattern news.
A:	i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock
