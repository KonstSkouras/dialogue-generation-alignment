A:	you want to go first
B:	well, uh, no i i don't get as much exercise as i, as i should as, or as i would like to, uh, uh, these days. i, seems to be to easy to get busy with other things. uh, i have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run, and every, every january and every september, i start out again and then it tapers off
A:	really?
B:	uh, what about you?
A:	well, yeah, i do a lot of exercise. right now, i'm into jazzercise, which i absolutely love. uh, i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years and i wanted to get it back off
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good.
B:	yeah.
A:	got out a lot of aggression. i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, i felt really good. i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. now when i do those things, they're boring. i would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and so i just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it and i'm just feeling really good. i love the class, it's real challenging, so i'm really into that, i really like that a lot.
B:	well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,
A:	it is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
B:	okay.
A:	it's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. and it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
B:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and i'm, i'm getting much better. my stamina is getting great for the dance floor so  i mean it's just,
B:	yeah.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
B:	well, uh, okay. now that's inside again, right?
A:	it is inside and i've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
B:	but,
A:	and i just enjoy that much more too than inside.
B:	do, do you like to do it with other people. i mean like the, the jazzercise would be?
A:	i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	so i've enjoyed that part of it. yeah. and at the gym, even in the class, uh, i, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. everybody's on their way to someplace
B:	right.
A:	and so, you know, i do  have one friend who goes occasionally
B:	but,
A:	but, basically, i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so.
B:	yeah, right. right. but still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.
A:	there are, there are. it's more motivating that way, i think. yeah.
B:	in terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.
A:	you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v but you probably wouldn't.
B:	yeah.
A:	so.
B:	yeah, uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
A:	yeah.
B:	i, i've, one thing, when, when i have run and jogged, uh, i've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that i was having to do, i, i've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, i write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. the, it's
A:	yeah, yeah, i can see it'll be a good break.
B:	the the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
A:	right.
B:	and i find that i can often, you know, often, uh, when i get around to doing it, then i, i feel better when i get back to work
A:	uh-huh
B:	and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i, i go back and i've got new ideas, but still .
A:	i think you do. you feel very good after you exercise. i think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
B:	yeah.
A:	you owe it to yourself
B:	yeah.
A:	and i think you do accomplish more after that.
B:	yeah.
A:	and i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, i think it's well worth it. i just demand that time for myself. now i've learned to do that
B:	yeah.
A:	and, you know, and it's, i think it just benefits you all around. so.
B:	yeah, i think that's, uh, i think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself. that you've just got to   you've just got to
A:	you have to. because   there's always more things to do.
B:	right.
A:	there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just, i don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, i just feel entitled to it
B:	yeah.
A:	and i take it so.
B:	well good, well good. well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging? i tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, uh, club.
A:	no, i've done some walking with friends in the past.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but i find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
B:	yeah.
A:	and that's not really beneficial, so, uh i don't have time like that
B:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and i spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
