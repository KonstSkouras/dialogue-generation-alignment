A:	okay
B:	okay carol. so air quality.
A:	yeah. is it like water running and she is doing i know in here uh downtown dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just you can see it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but then again i originally was from california and uh there is a big difference between texas and california. and uh  they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner.
B:	surely.
A:	and of course they don't have that here in texas so there's ...
B:	you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts?
A:	no not in not in well not in dallas that is.
B:	right. i i yeah i spent a summer in tyler so i know just east of dallas there.
A:	yeah. we're going there tomorrow.
B:	oh really
A:	uh-huh we're  packing and getting ready to go to .
B:	yeah. actually i'm a california born person.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i was born in l a so i know what you're talking about. in l a it's pretty bad.
A:	yeah. oh okay. yeah you do then.
B:	uh the worst city in the in the world is actually uh mexico city.
A:	is it really?
B:	yes.
A:	i would not imagine that.
B:	the worst one for smog is mexico city.
A:	huh.
B:	the most polluted city in the world
A:	huh. you learn  something every day.
B:	. yeah. i know that they've they're looking at uh uh you know uh you know better running automobiles.
A:	uh-huh. yeah i've seen that.
B:	uh some things they do one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
A:	huh.
B:	you ever heard of that?
A:	huh-uh.
B:	yeah. methanol?
A:	huh. no
B:	yeah. well that's big up here because of the they grow a lot of corn
A:	oh yeah yeah.
B:	uh that's one thing that they do. at that it's pretty easy to do.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and the uh unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to you know wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
A:	yeah that's true.
B:	it doesn't make sense. uh but it's you know one of the most uh productive crop in the world  is corn.
A:	right. huh. and of course i doubt if there's any you can buy regular anymore. you buy unleaded. right?
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. huh.
B:	drive cars with catalytic converters and all that. it's interesting. they're they're looking at there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electrical powered
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically but it has a a engine in the back that charges it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using any any energy
A:	huh that is good.
B:	unlike a car where it's running.
A:	yeah.
B:	a electric car it's on demand. i mean it's either on or off.
A:	yeah.
B:	basically.
A:	huh.
B:	you don't have to shift so you cars become very simple all  of a sudden too.
A:	oh.
B:	very interesting.
A:	that would be nice. i think i saw that on t v one time. they maybe it was c n n where they were demonstrating that. or something similar to that.
B:	yeah. there's there's a race in australia with solar powered cars.
A:	huh.
B:	and ford and general motors and all those compete.
A:	but what i think that was a a a setback. that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour. i think like
B:	right. yeah
A:	i don't know. huh. * see note above
B:	g m uh chrysler announced that they're going to they're well they actually have an electric minivan. yeah. their their caravan. but it costs uh fifty thousand dollars right now.
A:	yeah and they're they're very expensive too. .
B:	"to operate yeah. but you know people are buying them. you know whose buying them? *""whose"" = who's"" the power company. free you know free for them."
A:	well yeah. yeah.
B:	kind of interesting so see.
A:	well it doesn't make sense. because if they want people to convert you know. they should make it worthwhile.
B:	uh-huh. yeah it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. so it's  a good good  vehicle.
A:	yeah. yeah. um. well i'll tell you. sometimes it's it's pretty bad here. like today i think it was pretty bad. i don't know if it was if it's just uh the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
B:	uh-huh
A:	and other days it's just really bad so i don't know. so what what kinds of things did you experience in l a when you were there? or can you remember? were you there at a?
B:	oh i wasn't there too long ago. uh.
A:	cause i haven't been there probably ...
B:	well you know going over the hills you know coming into the valley?
A:	yeah.
B:	you can see that horrible horrible brown haze.
A:	well we were there when they had a
