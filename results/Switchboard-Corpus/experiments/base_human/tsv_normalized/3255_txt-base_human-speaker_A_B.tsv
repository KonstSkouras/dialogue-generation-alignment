A:	okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
B:	probably so
A:	and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train or or something like that or
B:	yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
A:	yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that
B:	uh-huh.
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool.
B:	i think so too. i'm in texas
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and very few people carpool
A:	yeah.
B:	uh the people that i know don't want to because uh they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
A:	exactly.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car.
A:	uh-huh or if somebody gets sick. yeah or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're they're stuck
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	you're definitely right
B:	that's right. and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
A:	uh-huh. sure. sure that happens quite a bit
B:	but uh you know i i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
A:	yes yeah
B:	but
A:	that's very true. uh other than that uh i don't know
B:	well my other line is ringing
A:	okay.
B:	but we're going to ignore it
A:	oh okay we'll try to be real quick here.
B:	i'm sorry for these beeps
A:	the other thing then is because i don't know how long they want us to talk
B:	oh close to five minutes i believe.
A:	five minutes oh okay.
B:	and you're in minneapolis
A:	minneapolis area
B:	well is the pollution really bad up there?
A:	uh actually no. we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	you get some pollutants such as those but those are natural
B:	yeah
A:	um but there is starting to in minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead into the air or other pollutants
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed
B:	well that's the way it has gotten here.
A:	at least where you .
B:	we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in texas
A:	sure yeah
B:	but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
A:	yeah it's not a bad idea. uh-huh. sure sure
B:	and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed
A:	exactly
B:	and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
A:	uh-huh. sure. uh-huh.
B:	uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
A:	sure.
B:	therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
A:	uh-huh. sure.
B:	and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems you know
A:	uh-huh. yeah. sure
B:	but
A:	uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
B:	uh-huh. right.
A:	but it's uncomfortable
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh into the air because he opened it
B:	um.
A:	and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i was thinking how many other people
B:	it's probably happened to millions of people
A:	oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there.
B:	uh-huh
A:	i think it's like three or four dollars a a can
B:	yeah.
A:	and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and i i thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
B:	inhaled so much of it uh-huh.
A:	but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that
B:	yeah well of course in the uh i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt
A:	exactly.
