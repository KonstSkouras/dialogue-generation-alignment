A:	uh i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty-four million people.
B:	oh.
A:	and uh i don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i i have a feeling since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's going to become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway.
B:	yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know
A:	well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high.
B:	oh definitely.
A:	and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
B:	right. yeah yeah.
A:	it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is.
B:	yeah. yeah yeah.
A:	and myself i guess.
B:	yeah that sounds like a good idea. my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i don't know
A:	well   well who who else is going to do this then?
B:	do they wind up with more red tape and more problems then? yeah yeah.
A:	i mean it's worked successfully in europe.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively and spend uh maybe half a year in europe every year
B:	oh.
A:	and i find that the health care programs there uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
B:	yeah.
A:	as a matter of fact if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm say in germany or france uh that i'm automatically taken care of
B:	wow.
A:	i mean i don't even have to pay.
B:	yeah. well i think part of the the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures people um you know just go on and on and on. i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if it what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers. they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.
A:	well i  uh uh i know it.
B:	well you know
A:	i have a solution you see. my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid i i my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they are um of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on medicare and medicaid i mean the  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in
B:	yeah.
A:	and the extraordinary amounts i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
B:	yeah yeah.
A:	and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
B:	oh it's unbelievable how much you go through. when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time
A:	that's right i mean it does  seem like we're
B:	it was just strange.
A:	now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness. so i
B:	oh well that should help.
A:	well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes.
B:	yeah
A:	i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens.
B:	oh i see oh gosh.
A:	well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it.
B:	okay well
A:	okay?
B:	okay thank you. bye-bye
A:	see you next time. bye.
