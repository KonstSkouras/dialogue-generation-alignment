A:	all right. i guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're satisfied with with the uh coverage that we receive.
B:	right. that's right.
A:	um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper and so uh i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also uh some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines and uh at work i also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events. uh how about yourself?
B:	well i'm like you. i don't i don't i like to read the paper but i basically don't do it every day and i um i usually watch uh either good morning america or the today show every morning while i'm you know
A:	uh-huh.
B:	whatever i'm doing i watch that. i usually watch the news either at you know early evening or at ten o'clock
A:	right right.
B:	so i get it from t v a lot. i get time i read time magazine um that's one i read pretty regularly.
A:	oh yeah. okay.
B:	and uh.  the thing about it you know now that i've found is that we get such good coverage on t v or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the time magazine there's nothing in it you don't know.
A:	you think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage and you get. uh-huh. it's historic events huh.
B:	right. then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i've thought lately there's nothing new in the time magazine.
A:	oh okay.
B:	you know it's it's basically you've heard everything
A:	yes.
B:	and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um i don't know. so i get most of mine from television
A:	yeah.
B:	i would say.
A:	um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in-depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read newsweek can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v but uh um i found out that also on on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to. um i found out though that or i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative. there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news. and it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
B:	right
A:	and uh.
B:	and i i think there's an attempt to do that. you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know.
A:	yes we do.
B:	i think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen. it's more negative like you said.
A:	true true.
B:	but i think people try to on on t v i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote.
A:	uh-huh. i've heard an interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes an awful lot of money and commitment and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and go after you know it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so. i don't know i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we have to pay that price but uh i don't know i don't know. it's interesting and i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the
B:	right. you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that  because we saw every single thing practically.
A:	exactly. we saw yes you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that. so.
B:	i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered. i remember watching the world series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen
A:	oh yes.
B:	i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the and the announcers you know grabbing
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real like you said
A:	oh yeah. yeah.
B:	and then of course one thing i think too is with
