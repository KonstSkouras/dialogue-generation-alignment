B:	well, um, i have a, a, a former exercise program. i'm a graduate student, and this semester, i'll tell you what, i, it's been almost impossible for me to get, you know, back to regular exercise. um, last summer i was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard, so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and, um, and since i worked at a recreation center i could, uh, you know, use those facilities quite often. but, um. oh, yeah. oh, yeah.
A:	and and it's least hard on your body,
B:	uh-huh, and there's and there's no jarring on the.
A:	i,
B:	pardon?
A:	it's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
B:	exactly, yeah, um,
A:	and
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
A:	right, right.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. how about you?
A:	well, i do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if i go, in the summer time i try to jog, jog a couple of miles
B:	oh, yeah.
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
A:	but so, i'm not quite getting the level that i need to.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
A:	i like it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i like it, uh, part of my problem is i have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
B:	uh-huh. sure, yeah.
A:	of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
B:	uh-huh, yeah. uh, i, um, i used to, uh, i used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now i weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. um, so i drastically had to change the way i ate when i, when i first moved to college, and, uh, i had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so i got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when i'm not fat like i used to be  i don't worry about it
A:	right, you don't notice it  as much,
B:	, yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. although lately i have noticed, you know, even if i gain, like two pounds, i start, i start feeling it and,
A:	you feel it, don't you?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for, oh, i don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places and things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, so, do you do, uh, in texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
B:	yeah, there are. um, i'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
A:	do you enjoy it, or is it, uh. if you can have, find the time it's just the.
B:	uh-huh yeah, i really do, because i like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
A:	yeah, it is hard
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it is hard. it's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	my problem is i don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
B:	exactly.
A:	don't get enough sleep as it is, right
B:	uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
B:	oh, yeah.
A:	you feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. yeah, yeah.
A:	if i eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
B:	uh-huh. do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
A:	i do. i have to be real careful.
B:	uh-huh. i stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
A:	did you?
B:	uh-huh, completely. i mean, any kind of meat or, and i, and i really feel a lot better now.
A:	makes a lot of difference.
B:	yeah, it really does.
A:	well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
B:	uh-huh, yeah, that's it, i mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
A:	right.
B:	and so. i found that really helps.
A:	and unless you really like, uh, fish. fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
B:	yeah, i eat that, i think i've eaten fish like twice since. i used to eat a lot of fish, too, but i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
A:	kind of see what happens.
B:	yeah, and i like it.
A:	i've tried to do that with sugar
B:	i don't know if i'm that brave yet .
A:	everything has sugar in it . i mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	course, and i like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but. anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
B:	okay, yeah, it sounds good.
A:	okay.
B:	well, good luck to you there in idaho.
A:	well, you, too. good luck, uh, enjoy college while you can. let me tell you it's, uh.
B:	well, i'm in graduate school now. i, i, i kind of feel like i wish i could have gone back to undergraduate now
A:	it's a little different, uh challenge, isn't it?
B:	yeah. yeah, it is. well, it's good talking,
A:	where are you going studying?
B:	pardon? i'm studying speech pathology.
A:	right.
