A:	you want to go first?
B:	no you can start
A:	okay. uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we what do we think about a judge making the decision?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i really don't agree with that i think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time.
B:	right.
A:	you know what i mean?
B:	right. there's there this topic is kind of mute. uh
A:	yeah.
B:	there there's no way. we we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
A:	right.
B:	uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
A:	that's it.
B:	uh every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. uh.
A:	well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could could it you you know change the system. i i really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime. there's uh no question
B:	right.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. you know all these things. i mean you know we've gone through this over and over again.
B:	right. they shouldn't allow an appeal.
A:	and it can go on for ten twenty years.
B:	yep.
A:	i i think this is a little ridiculous.
B:	uh-huh
A:	i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
B:	oh that's right. i work for a law firm
A:	i i'm serious. and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. with plea bargaining.
B:	right.
A:	you know if someone is
B:	well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
A:	well.
B:	plea bargaining is something completely different. that that actually prevents trials. or at least speeds them up.
A:	well i know. that's what i'm saying. but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard. i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but  you know they get lesser sentences
B:	right.
A:	and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh  and that they have to do something.
B:	right.
A:	but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
B:	huh.
A:	you know what i'm saying? that we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
B:	right.
A:	and uh i i think they should.
B:	we do
A:	i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that kill people and uh you know all
B:	right.
A:	they they're caught dead to rights. i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life.
B:	right. when you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned.
A:	yeah.
B:	we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up
A:	oh really.
B:	so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession.
A:	it uh yeah.
B:	but uh that was absurd there is never there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
A:	i know that that uh-huh. and i don't know. uh what would you do to change it? to make it better?
B:	well uh the the only i can i you know the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of. uh like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd. there's no way that could work.
A:	oh yeah. i i i don't agree with that at all.
B:	uh but
A:	imagine the guilt that person would have. i mean  burned out.
B:	oh exactly.
A:	there's  there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself.
B:	exactly. right.
A:	if you had to do something like that day after day.
B:	no one would want the job
A:	no. not really.
B:	uh and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case.
A:	well do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like
B:	oh yeah. i i feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury. that that that right
A:	i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you.
B:	well i mean were there witnesses?
A:	in other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
B:	right. right. that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
A:	yeah.
B:	i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
A:	yeah.
B:	and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances
A:	well i i
