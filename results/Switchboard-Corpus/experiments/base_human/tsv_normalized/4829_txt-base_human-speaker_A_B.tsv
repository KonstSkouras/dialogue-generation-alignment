A:	okay uh let me see. unfortunately we are not much into recycling.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	we don't we don't do enough. i know we don't so uh although lately i've been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and it's it's it's uh interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me uh where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i can kind of tell it bothers her so just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of uh uh paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore. i don't know why i just don't i just just from socializing with her so.
B:	how do you how uh is recycling done in your community? is
A:	it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't. uh i know in my mother's neighborhood in san antonio each each house has they're they're given three baskets
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
B:	right.
A:	and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything. and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it. which really doesn't make sense.
B:	oh. right. over here they uh have several private companies that you can take uh recycled materials to. but uh if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off. that's what i do. uh and i i recycle aluminum glass uh newspapers.
A:	yeah that's good.
B:	so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
A:	yeah yeah. that's another thing. you have to go to different places to do that.
B:	right. so it's so that's nice. it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that but uh uh it didn't go through.
A:	uh-huh. but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. which uh i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me.
B:	right. i guess what they what they were talking about here was uh was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know.
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	uh so i guess that's one option.
A:	yeah. that's good that's good.
B:	i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too. like uh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?
A:	huh. no.
B:	yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
A:	oh i didn't know that.
B:	yeah. so now they're like marking uh they're i don't know there's six seven eight different kind of plastics and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is.
A:	yeah.
B:	so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're they're uh trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess.
A:	uh-huh. well that's good. i i'm you know unfortunately garland doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i you know i read those little slips that come in to your utility bills or your uh garbage collection
B:	right.
A:	and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that
B:	where does your friend go to to recycle?
A:	she lives in garland and i'm not sure where what she does. but she's uh oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh she has i i really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that to start doing. and she does make a lot of sense.
B:	yeah.
A:	just her whole house is like wow.
B:	i guess that's how it gets passed on. you know when one person you hear  from another person
A:	yeah.
B:	and then uh and then you and then you pass it on.
A:	yeah.
B:	it seems to be catching on uh slowly but surely i guess
A:	yeah. and uh my little boy has watches a program that was really neat. i sat and watched him. you know the barney? you know the little i don't know if you know the little character barney.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can can do that and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on.
B:	uh-huh. wow that's cute. that's neat yeah. when you
A:	and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing. he's really caught on so that's really neat
B:	well when you start early i guess
