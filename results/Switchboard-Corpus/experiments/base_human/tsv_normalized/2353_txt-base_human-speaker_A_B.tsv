A:	so what do you think about a year or two of public service?
B:	well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know their carefree years
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but people that i have known that have done that like from other countries especially from germany and finland um they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	and i think they're better people because of it
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they're much more responsible. i know um the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our society better.
A:	you know i i really agree with you. um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i did it um for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i it changed it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i think um in fact if i had to do it all again i you know after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back.
B:	huh.
A:	um so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
B:	yeah.
A:	um i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed
B:	huh. and rattling in
A:	and i thought that was you know very interesting and i i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the mormon church that does that?
B:	yes. yes.
A:	because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would have probably like you said to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country i think it would have been a very good um experience for me.
B:	uh-huh. well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um there's kind of a selfishness
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um thinking less of your own needs but of other people.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i worked in a very rural school district and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and these kids um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant.
B:	oh no.
A:	many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to condition in poverty and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think it's a really good idea. and even if it is overseas.
B:	right. uh-huh.
A:	see i never i i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
B:	yes.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it would really um and i don't the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah.
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
A:	right. uh-huh.
B:	and um you know although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature than the average student
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and like she's washing
A:	yeah. i think it would also help them if they then went on to college. i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and then at the end i had to be too serious.
B:	well that's right. a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just get so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that that we really don't want our young people to be doing
A:	yeah that's true.
B:	and
A:	uh-huh that's right.
B:	um.
A:	i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
A:	uh you know
B:	because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people like
A:	uh-huh. yeah that's true.
B:	but you know our like in our church it it is your free to do that or not
A:	uh-huh.
B:	you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and of course we think it's helping other people.
A:	oh i think it is.
B:	and so
A:	i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situation
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand
B:	and they're preoccupied with drinking.
A:	uh-huh. yeah i think that's uh just having a good time.
B:	uh-huh. and
A:	i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented. i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know
B:	uh-huh.
A:	today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented
B:	that's true. paper
A:	and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.
B:	that's really true.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	yeah. well i i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um
A:	well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps.
B:	oh really.
A:	uh-huh. because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe uh they've increased funding for the peace corps. some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known
B:	uh-huh.
A:	when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the peace corps
B:	huh.
A:	and some of the are the overseas programs. uh
B:	well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my what i was going to study
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer. why? because they make a lot of money.
A:	yeah. yeah that's true.
B:	and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
A:	yeah that's very true. you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near washington being in in baltimore it's something like one in four people in the washington  area are lawyers
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and and i just sort of think that's ridiculous.
B:	yes.
A:	yeah with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with aids and cancer and and how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
B:	there's just too many people. uh-huh. that's right. not enough people want to do that to for uh because of a service that they could provide.
A:	uh-huh. right.
B:	you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich.
A:	uh-huh. yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah that's true.
B:	that's kind of sad. well anyway.
A:	that's interesting. uh-huh.
B:	well i guess i better go.
A:	okay. hey thanks so much for the conversation.
B:	well good luck to you. i enjoyed it.
A:	well thank you very much. bye-bye.
B:	thanks. bye-bye.
