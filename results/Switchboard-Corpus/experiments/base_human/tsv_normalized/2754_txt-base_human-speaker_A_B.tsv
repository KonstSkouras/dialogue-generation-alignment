A:	okay.
B:	okay. well uh anyways i'm not exactly sure i i wasn't really uh paying attention as to what particular uh parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about but it was uh basically what's your views on whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used that sort of thing?
A:	yeah.
B:	right. and uh i don't know i've i've always thought that any uh crime that uh that uh intentionally where someone goes out and premeditatively takes another life would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that you know there's a a very steep penalty to uh be paid when that's done
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh. yeah how do you feel about it?
A:	uh i believe in it too
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i'm catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it. well you know you you got you got that point well you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone you know to death that really didn't do it.
B:	right exactly.
A:	there's always that chance i don't know but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you know what i'm saying? like
B:	right. if if the evidence wasn't overwhelming right?
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	so uh i
B:	well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because i don't know i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
A:	exactly. uh i'm not sure about pennsylvania whether we have it or not. for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often. i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it.
B:	yeah i don't think we
A:	i don't do you know if virginia has it?
B:	no huh-uh. no we don't.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	i know florida has it.
B:	uh-huh. oh yeah they're always in florida. florida and louisiana i think and uh some of the  other southern states.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
A:	uh you know
B:	get that unemployment way up so then people you know tend towards crime and then they they start stiffening the penalties.
A:	yeah. but it's funny that uh i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania. i'm not even sure of that but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that. and it surprised and even florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
B:	well in florida seems like uh two or three times a year. it's constantly on the
A:	yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed  you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many.
B:	yeah. no that's true. course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted.
A:	yeah.
B:	so of course the the attorneys
A:	everyone would appeal. that's true too.
B:	they go all the way up to the supreme court you know.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	they almost always get thrown right back out again but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	some of these guys are really uh you know violent son of sam killers and stuff like that you know.
A:	yeah uh-huh.
B:	i mean they
A:	and then they get out.
B:	everyone knows they're going get not going to get out.
A:	yeah they get out in three years on probation
B:	yeah.
A:	and they do it again you know.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it's like a slap on the fingers for them.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i don't i don't i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also. but uh but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
B:	i think so.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh a lot of the the the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about. although you know stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean these guys are certainly not going to uh be they can't i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. i don't think the parole system is really helping that much
A:	yeah.
B:	reduce the violence in the prisons. i think that's its only purpose is is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. off earlier.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	but some of these guys just don't care  you know. and so uh
A:	i think some of them would rather be in jail
B:	yeah right uh-huh.
A:	yeah. they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
B:	um that's possible i guess.
A:	i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was. oh i don't even remember what it was now.
B:	um so where do you live in pennsylvania?
A:	in clarion. well i live in butler but i'm at i'm at college. i'm at clarion university.
B:	oh okay. i don't think i really know that.
A:	yeah
B:	because uh you know that all depends too on where you are at. that's uh sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. because the more grass root country uh parts of the country tend to to support capital punishment where the places that are you know less in contact with crime you know the the more more urban i mean less
A:	uh-huh. see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind okay uh we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah and that would be pushing it. so i mean this is definitely a college town. uh we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any. uh
B:	two hours where?
A:	north of pittsburgh pennsylvania.
B:	oh okay. near polk?
A:	oh i've never heard of polk but
B:	polk institute. it's uh an old uh university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. uh
A:	oh i never heard of that.
B:	very old uh historical place there.
A:	it might have a new name.
B:	sharon pennsylvania's up there.
A:	yeah yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	we're probably about an hour away from sharon.
B:	oh okay.
A:	uh-huh. uh so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know you know.
B:	in that case maybe you know.
A:	yeah. you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another. i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life. uh anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
B:	right. that's true. yeah well it it you know you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have you know stolen kids and you know  done terrible things to them and killed them and you know that sort of thing
A:	uh-huh.
B:	you just like i don't want that person sharing the earth with me you know i mean that is just terrible.
A:	yeah uh-huh.
B:	and uh you know we had a case like that here and on the other hand you know people are saying that because the he knows because the criminals know that the uh penalties can be very severe they uh there's less criminals that are you know turning themselves in or you know pleading or whatever because they know that the judge you know if they find them guilty is you know has the the opportunity to sentence them you know for for the death sentence.
A:	yeah
B:	yeah. well i'm just saying that that that's what the the client lawyers are saying. they're saying that you know you know more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to to to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah. that's something you know but uh whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know.
B:	right uh-huh.
A:	so i don't think that they deserve anything less
B:	yeah right.
A:	it's just i don't i don't know i just
B:	uh-huh. i was just saying that way what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. and so we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
A:	uh-huh and that costs money yeah.
B:	and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are are guys that are you know going to get caught anyways but there's always a few of those people that are you know lost their head or whatever.
A:	yeah.
B:	anyways but uh. yeah we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know mandatory life sentences for murder.
