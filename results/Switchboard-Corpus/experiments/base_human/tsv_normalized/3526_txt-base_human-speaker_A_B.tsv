B:	oh yeah definitely.
A:	that's where the speed helps out.
B:	uh yeah unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty-six. it's like slow out the
A:	yep that will that will slow you up
B:	huh?
A:	well i i do uh uh programming for c n c turret presses and uh cat cam system type things
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh really need a faster system. uh i got a new line that i i sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera.
B:	uh-huh.

B:	uh-huh.
A:	and as they and as they go to the next one i just keep the
B:	oh that works.
A:	that's why i have so many different levels of p c around at the moment.
B:	uh here it is. a t s computers.

A:	yeah.
B:	it's a little place looks like a castle.
A:	yeah.
B:	kind of uh little guy in there. he he uh gives reasonable prices.
A:	oh.
B:	like i i traded my uh three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
A:	really? well that's a good deal.
B:	yeah it was pretty reasonable.
A:	yeah.
B:	but uh uh he and he does a good job and he he he uh guarantees everything he sells.
A:	uh there is a lot you ever go by lucky computer there?
B:	uh-huh yeah.
A:	i used to when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys i'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. so i i don't know where those guys are at these days. but i 
B:	uh they they're up there in that mall. uh just below campbell. or that strip strip center.
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	they're still doing business. big business apparently.
A:	i tell you those prices have just unbelievably come down.
B:	uh-huh oh yeah i was amazed i was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in you know it's like wow
A:	yeah.
B:	that works i'll go do that
A:	i
B:	and boy that thing screams now.
A:	yeah i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the three eighty-six. that wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
B:	uh-huh. well i thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six s x even though the the price difference is about ten dollars.
A:	is that right? that's it?
B:	yeah it when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	i'll be darned.
B:	yeah.
A:	huh well
