A:	let's see, mine's pretty easy actually. uh, i just got done reading a, a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the, uh, new saturns.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh, and, although i can't afford it right now, i would just like love to have one.
B:	oh, really, you like, uh, so you're an american
A:	well,
B:	you want to buy american.
A:	no, regardless of that fact. it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. i'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
B:	um.
A:	and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away.
B:	it terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
A:	handling, power, everything. yeah, it just got like the top rating. it was compared up against, uh, let's see, there was like the mazda m x three, uh, nissan's, whatever, their two, n x two thousand, the civic s i and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them. everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it. i like the, i like the styling and, i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it.
B:	what about mustang g t
A:	mustang g t uh, can't afford it.
B:	those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
A:	right, yeah, i'm a graduate student and, let's face it, i don't make any money so,
B:	right. well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.
A:	yeah. yeah, we'll see then. yeah, right now i'm stuck, i, i've got a, a pontiac sunbird turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing. but it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the saturn.
B:	right, would you use that for city driving and racing?
A:	oh, yeah, i'd do it, i'd use it for both. the nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
B:	autocrossing is, what kind of track is that?
A:	uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. and pylons and things.
B:	okay. and you put up, set up the track, pylons. okay.
A:	tight turns, hard acceleration. i've seen a lot of mustangs, uh, compete and it's interesting. they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class.
B:	oh, really?
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah, i would guess so.
A:	uh, what are you thinking about buying?
B:	uh, i think i'd like to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, i mean, a, a acura legend. uh
A:	the legend. uh.
B:	a lexus, uh, s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	you know, because your b m w your german cars have good reputations, i think.
A:	yeah, well, i was, i was actually in, uh, a lot of the b m w are produced in, uh, uh, stutgardt and, uh, and munich
B:	yes.
A:	and i was, i was there this, uh, summer and, uh, i was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for b m w.
B:	the, yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, i mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
A:	yeah.
B:	i mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
A:	uh, oh, of course, of course they are. they want you to buy their car. yeah, there, it was, it was interesting. i was at, i, i also went to, uh, the porsche and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
B:	oh, really?
A:	yeah, the, uh, the b m w is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and, and then you go to porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
B:	um.
A:	and no two of them are alike and
B:	yeah that's,
A:	so it's like completely opposed. i don't know, which do i like better, i think i like the porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
B:	no, it's not realistic.
A:	unless, it's, it's a toy.
B:	yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, i guess, uh
A:	let's face it. yeah, yeah, but it, it, b m w good for that. what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?
B:	yeah, just work, short trips. no no heavy mileage. i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
A:	wow, yeah.
B:	so it's pretty minimal.
A:	that's cool.
B:	lasts a long time. that's mainly what i'm looking for.
A:	yeah, that's good. i also, i was impressed by, uh, by the mercedes, too.
B:	oh, yeah.
A:	i really, i really like the mercedes.
B:	but, but if, if you have a problem with a mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
A:	the factory was nice and, and is it different for the, for the b m w?
B:	uh, i think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
A:	probably. right, i can imagine that.
B:	so i'm kind, yeah, i'm not sure if i really want,
