A:	well um since i'm in college uh i mean uh i haven't seen that much change i'm kind of young still i don't know how much it changed in the last uh twenty years anyway. but i don't know. do you do you have an idea of of how much.
B:	no i'm not that old either
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i'm only twenty-nine.
A:	oh okay.
B:	so social changes aren't that much for me either.
A:	yeah right. well i can remember are from from my childhood were the disco days and maybe that's changed a lot. uh the way the way people dress
B:	well yeah that.
A:	and uh.
B:	i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
A:	more lax?
B:	uh-huh relaxed and laid back and stuff
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and.
A:	maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.
B:	i think so.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think so and a lot i think people are are used to now saying what's what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
A:	right. right. uh-huh. especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like you know pro-life and and uh choice in in the special interest groups maybe um like amnesty.
B:	right.
A:	uh yeah maybe people are a little a little more uh free to express their opinions socially free.
B:	yeah i think so. i think women have come out more too on on like child abuse and and the wife beatings
A:	oh yeah. right.
B:	and and like you said pro pro-choice and whatnot.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. right.
B:	i think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
A:	right. just wasn't socially acceptable.
B:	no huh-uh.
A:	yeah. uh maybe maybe too a big social change that's that's maybe for the worst is uh is is how um the people's uh views on on relationships has changed you know and now we have now we have several you know we have to worry about aids and we have to worry about uh maybe people are becoming more aware more more afraid of relationships.
B:	right. well i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom you know and all that stuff
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and you know we didn't have to talk about well basically her thing was just don't do it you know
A:	right. yeah.
B:	but i'm not i'm not naive to think that my children are not going to not do it.
A:	yeah.
B:	it wasn't that long that i was that young.
A:	yeah.
B:	and i've got a ten year old and you know he thought he knows about condoms and and he knows about aids
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. right. it used to be that we were that we were trying to protect morality. now it's we're protecting our lives. it's a it's a much different
B:	uh-huh.
A:	we have you know you can't just just hope for abstinence.
B:	no i don't i think that's stupidity on parents' part. i mean that's sex is rampant
A:	yeah.
B:	and it always will be and and i think too noticing the kids that the fourth and fifth graders which is what my son is and stuff they they're just they're more they're very open.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	i mean the boys are very open because that's that's all i have is boys so that's all i'm around basically is boys
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	but they talk about things that i my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer.
A:	that's right.
B:	you can't get them give them the oh you know cabbage patch answers and stuff.
A:	yeah.
B:	they they that just does not go.
A:	right.
B:	and they can tell me basically some things that i don't know
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but it it's interesting listening to them. i think i think the social changes in them i think i see it more with that generation than i do with like our generation.
A:	uh-huh. right right. yeah i i i imagine you're right. i i teach swim lessons a lot and and to see what see what kids talk about when uh you know they're they're open about well you know kids are a lot more educated now than i think that that like we were uh at that age um about a lot of things.
B:	yeah i do too.
A:	you know besides what besides what they learn uh from from our social environment is uh their education is just amazing. kids are kids are learning uh you know their math is just every year uh algebra goes down a grade you know and and uh students learn it earlier.
B:	i know well my son the my fourth grader he is
