A:	why don't you tell me about your choir.
B:	oh. okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh plano community orchestra. uh just you know different backgrounds. it's been really kind of interesting.
A:	great.
B:	so
A:	uh i play the piano
B:	um.
A:	and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano. he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting.
B:	oh yeah.
A:	i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at music man.
B:	oh they did?
A:	yeah and that's lots of fun.
B:	how did how did they get involved in that?
A:	uh basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. it was the plano repertory theatre.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and so they went and tried out and my husband played harold hill from the music man and my son played one of the children in a band.
B:	oh how fun.
A:	so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school and my daughter takes piano lessons too.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but uh we just really like music. it's a i i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off we get the t v off and just have some nice quiet music.
B:	um uh-huh um. yeah yeah that's nice. you say have your four year old taking lessons already?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh who do you have her or him take it from?
A:	uh i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki. which is an auditory type learning experience.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i teach uh like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano but he can't learn like that. he's a delayed child. he's only about i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
B:	oh.
A:	and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand we went wow
B:	uh-huh.
A:	we better have him do do something. you know educationally.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	so that was really fun.
B:	well because my
A:	my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though.
B:	pardon me?
A:	so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into dallas.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
A:	um.
B:	because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. she just
A:	oh i think that's great.
B:	so i wasn't sure when to start her. i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
A:	that's really hard i think because especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like god i really want you to do it.
B:	uh-huh yeah.
A:	you know.
B:	yeah.
A:	so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and of course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it was something easily forgotten. so uh i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven. i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. she does have to really work at it but uh so
A:	that's like me.
B:	yeah but so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but
A:	well it can get expensive
B:	yeah.
A:	that's for sure.
B:	yeah.
A:	i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the suzuki method without paying a lot out.
B:	uh-huh. oh that's good.
A:	yeah so it's been good for our family.
B:	well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method have you had any former suzuki students?
A:	i don't have any suzuki students. uh
B:	i was wondering how
A:	something happening to me at christmas time that that verified to me that i will
