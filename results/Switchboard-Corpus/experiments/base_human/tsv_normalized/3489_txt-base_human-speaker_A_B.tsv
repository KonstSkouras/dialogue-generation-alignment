A:	okay jerry i guess tonight's topic is about recycling.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in plano.
B:	all right.
A:	right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city along with your garbage can. uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material and that is on a roll out effort right now. not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and uh participate right now but uh that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so. and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum. and i think uh overall that's an an excellent opportunity because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today but for the future also. so
B:	yeah uh i was
A:	how about your community?
B:	my community that's cute. i live in a place called dye mound.
A:	dye mound?
B:	or dye community.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and it's not a city not incorporated my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least i can't even see their house and uh
A:	sounds like a place where i grew up
B:	yeah i mean uh i'm out in i'm out in the wilderness. literally.
A:	well i like it.
B:	and uh well give you an idea it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete i mean to the asphalt we're out there.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh we i do some interesting recycling things.
A:	well good.
B:	i'm building our house right now and i'm going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher.
A:	oh okay.
B:	so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and the weight of the car will crush what's ever in the disposer.
A:	oh.
B:	hopefully it's not my wife.
A:	well let's hope not. you can be uh get in trouble for that.
B:	well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a an escapement type thing. i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and then you go over and release it and then it just it just drops you know.
A:	well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it?
B:	very similar yeah.
A:	okay okay.
B:	well what what it will be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down.
A:	yes until you release it.
B:	until you pull the pin yeah.
A:	all right.
B:	anyway i have another uh recycling method i use.
A:	i think yes.
B:	you know all that junk mail you get?
A:	oh yes i sure do.
B:	the glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up.
A:	uh-huh. oh.
B:	because uh well like i say we live a way and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard.
A:	yes.
B:	and i don't like that
A:	no.
B:	so i don't do that. so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them.
A:	well great. that's excellent.
B:	i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
A:	well uh if a lot of people did that then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. that's a great idea. i hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that. one thing
B:	yeah. well i think one of the the best ways to eliminate uh or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.
A:	right.
B:	for instance uh i saw a thing on uh nova i think it was the other day.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	this guy has designed recyclable materials i mean recyclable items.
A:	right.
B:	whatever he makes it's all out of the same thing.
A:	oh.
B:	see so plastic it's all out of plastic.
A:	yes.
B:	if it's metal it's all out of metal. it's he's a design he's a engineer designing stuff.
A:	well that's a great idea that's a great idea.
B:	and and incorporating you know reusable materials into your uh you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale.
A:	products. yes.
B:	make it financially uh attractive to recycle
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
A:	yes they will.
B:	and
A:	exactly.
B:	well there is a guy in dallas that's all he does.
A:	huh.
B:	he collects trash. you know and
A:	well that's a full time job.
B:	yeah well he's he's out for cardboard.
A:	yes well i've found out too that uh you know a couple years ago we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years and at one time we could get a pretty good return uh with the boy scouts. we could take and collect the newspaper
