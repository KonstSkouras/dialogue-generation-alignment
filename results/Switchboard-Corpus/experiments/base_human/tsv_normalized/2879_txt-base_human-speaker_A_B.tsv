A:	okay there's one uh i meant living in texas where you at?
B:	i'm in rome new york.
A:	in where rome  new york?
B:	rome new york yeah.
A:	rome new york okay well texas let me look at my husband and ask him to some one else in yes they do he's reminding me of where i live yeah.
B:	yeah i i new york does not
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but uh they're they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that uh the democrat that he is  and mario cuomo
A:	uh-huh. yes.
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
A:	yeah i uh i ethically don't like the idea but or i should say morally i don't like the idea but uh social and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea in certain crimes.
B:	i'd i would agree with that even more i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended  by the thought that i have to support  uh just the existence of you know murder rapist  you know  right that uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill  them whatever that society has to pay uh upwards  uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. right any   on the street no i know. uh-huh. yeah and texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from from killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
B:	right.
A:	and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in you know i mean you think why they say it's because you're over crowd it's over crowded and you think how is is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
B:	i i don't know
A:	i know.
B:	it's a hard question you look at the united states we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh
A:	and then
B:	or uh
A:	i don't know how americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in austin texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an f b i check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
B:	here in new york it's a lot harder than that uh
A:	is it that's good.
B:	it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state.
A:	say that good i think that's like the state of virginia yeah that's great.
B:	now the the and that's with uh you have to have uh oh a police investigation you have to  have references
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know there's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that  which aren't the i i don't consider to be the kind of crime uh  weapon you know
A:	uh-huh. right they're no the cattiness behind right yeah
B:	uh so
A:	i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in florida in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case
B:	right.
A:	and how they just well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety
B:	right.
A:	and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you you know this is nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a i might be too cold too but they flip a switch
B:	yeah yeah
A:	i don't know
B:	well and the thing with bundy was though he escaped
A:	i mean
B:	and then
A:	so many times.
B:	yeah
A:	yeah.
B:	and did it again and uh
A:	yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one  you know
B:	no.
A:	you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they buried her alive
B:	oh god.
A:	and peter strauss had played the lead role and the man and and at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh that's nice.
B:	great.
A:	i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh definite  you know lasting
B:	surely  there's and end to the situation.
A:	right in that particular instance uh but i but i don't but i know it's on a and all and be all
B:	right.
A:	that's the problem i have with it in texas they think it's and all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody uh that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime  ridden
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in minneapolis saint paul uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is  even suburban no matter where you are
B:	right.
A:	and how you're in  rome new york
B:	rome new york it's up state it it's uh near syracuse
A:	is that and and is that like near albany or syracuse
B:	it's about uh well i i actually live in a village of sylvan beach i work in rome uh
A:	what what type of area is that
B:	it's more rural
A:	is that in term
B:	uh it use to be use to be a uh uh have a lot of heavy industry
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south
A:	sure.
B:	and uh now the air force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh uh  so it's   not too bad
A:	how would  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and  and things that would
B:	it you know you still have the uh more drug problems and typical  uh small city type problems
A:	not too bad. yeah. uh-huh.
B:	but i don't know that there's a real uh
A:	not the harsh criminality  that you find in
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
A:	yeah now dallas is a i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great  uh on some days uh it's uh i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and  deed for deed that  that does something uh
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over  crowded
B:	right.
A:	i mean that's that's just not a cop out uh and i just you know i'm originally from pennsylvania which i think is basically like new york these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there.
B:	i think i think pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i'm from uh  from pennsylvania also just uh just outside  of philadelphia
A:	uh-huh. yeah and i'm from pittsburgh so  oh well we'll forgive each other
B:	yeah.
A:	uh because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty  years
B:	right.
A:	but uh
B:	the west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so.
A:	there you go i don't know that's a different subject  altogether
B:	right.
A:	but uh i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime. i think everyone would you and i think are honest and candid because we could do it on in this  vehicle uh
B:	right.
A:	but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out  i think every human does i think they'd say yeah
B:	sure.
A:	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know
B:	yeah
A:	uh
B:	if your friends or family got uh had that happen to them i think everyone would i they'd  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face  as they did it.
A:	uh-huh. yeah i just  don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and uh rape rapist getting their hand  just slapped you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session  you know all these uh intangible things
B:	yeah. right.
A:	and you're thinking oh you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting uh
B:	right. right.
A:	but i don't know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either i just
B:	well uh i uh yeah i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty  pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted.
A:	uh-huh. is it uh how about the injection
B:	oh yeah an injection
A:	is that suppose to be.
B:	yeah that would be even yeah i didn't even think about that.
A:	yeah. i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh it's more that don't have it
B:	i think
A:	isn't that correct.
B:	yeah there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like uh massachusetts went back  and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books.
A:	yeah i don't know if they've they did something about i'm not sure if texas minnesota i they didn't they didn't they were well did they have it they were against it uh texas as i said has it but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not  if they've done it in the last
B:	right.
