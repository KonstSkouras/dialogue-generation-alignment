A:	what do you like to watch on television ?
B:	well i guess a lot of the uh something that's kind of more of a comedy. we do have uh cable and we have premium stations like h b o and showtime and such and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the t v on i i normally go to those because i pay for them
A:	yes
B:	i guess i i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there so i don't end up watching the um prime time on some of the standard channels as much i tend to go to my premium channels first
A:	uh-huh uh-huh. well we have cable but we only have cinemax and uh i think our favorite night is uh monday night
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we start out with evening shade and major dad
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you know my husband's always got it on.
B:	yeah.
A:	i'm not always sitting down and
B:	monday night's pretty good with murphy brown and designing women.
A:	yes. yes yes. i just i love that all those that two hours
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie did you watch did you watch it?
B:	uh-huh. we had watched it uh i guess sunday night and monday night but we didn't get to watch it tonight.
A:	yeah it it was pretty good it uh sometimes i like a dramatization and i like uh u s a when they had their uh uh mystery movies and things their made for t v movies
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and uh i like those. we very seldom watch any uh public television channel thirteen. do you watch it much?
B:	the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. they have some british comedy that we've we've really liked
A:	yes.
B:	and there's a variety. some of them is uh black adder or good neighbors or yes prime minister and are you being served? they they rotate those around and um we like that british comedy. british comedy is very fast you really have to listen
A:	yes
B:	but.
A:	now we haven't watched any of those.
B:	they're real good but they do come on kind of late but we really do enjoy those. sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the discovery channel.
A:	yes now we have watched some things on that.
B:	and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there. but i'm very intrigued. i one time i was watching an operation and i thought gee i don't believe i'm watching.
A:	yeah we had uh i don't know my husband loves to uh that male syndrome of flicking that channel so you know and he's sit in front of it and and he went by and he said whoops and he backed up and you know there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know
B:	yeah.
A:	and i'm saying let's move right on
B:	yeah right right
A:	but our grandchildren like that discovery channel if they're over here because lots of times it will have things on uh animals
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and they just thoroughly you know enjoy that
B:	uh-huh.
A:	in fact i think they were watching something on uh whales or killer sharks one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and uh so we have watched that
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh otherwise of course my husband's into the football
B:	oh.
A:	and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him.
B:	right. yeah i'm not into watching sports. now my husband likes to watch football he's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much but uh football soon as it's fall then he likes to watch college on saturday and then of course cowboys on sunday.
A:	yes. yes and sometimes now we're getting that uh the other football where they play it inside and you know this is a you know this is too much saturdays and sunday this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know all of that
B:	yeah.
A:	and uh but he will uh he'll flip around i think the other night we had on uh uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down. i don't know what channel he found that on
B:	um.
A:	and uh but he will turn that on especially for if again if our uh oldest grandson is over here. he's ten
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know i keep telling them it's the same mentality you know and something's wrong and uh but uh and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night because we're not home
B:	oh.
A:	and uh so and sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos
B:	um.
A:	do you ever watch that?
B:	yeah the you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
A:	yeah uh-huh
B:	yeah those are pretty good but true to life
A:	that are sometimes so dumb
B:	i mean some of the
A:	but very true to life i mean i've seen our family in several of those situations
