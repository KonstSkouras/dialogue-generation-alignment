A:	so you have a child uh-huh.
B:	yeah we two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think.
A:	uh
B:	how about you do you have any children?
A:	yes our first and he just turned three months.
B:	oh boy.
A:	so we're just starting into hunting for child care.
B:	yeah.
A:	right now both of us are students.
B:	are you? where are a student?
A:	uh uh university of southern mississippi.
B:	no kidding.
A:	uh she's
B:	i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two?
A:	uh probably. uh actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh five days a week more than likely. uh depending on how my class schedule runs
B:	yeah.
A:	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it will be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing.
B:	yeah.
A:	so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. right now we're trying to avoid it but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him. uh i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	so for about twenty twenty thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
B:	well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
A:	uh-huh
B:	and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
A:	yeah.
B:	and uh that's more important than anything else. we could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh she goes to a home. this is a uh a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they've been here probably thirty forty years.
A:	yeah.
B:	they've got three daughters. uh and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
A:	yeah.
B:	so it's a good experience.
A:	uh that makes a big difference.
B:	i if it's good i think it's very good for the child.
A:	yes.
B:	and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it. she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
A:	yeah.
B:	but uh we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace. i don't know what it's like around uh hattiesburg.
A:	there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
A:	and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of uh uh their home ec department
B:	yeah. i'll bet they're involved. yeah.
A:	uh they uh they have a subbranch uh american family counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus. but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list.
B:	yeah
A:	so
B:	well that's uh i know it's it's a real hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	out here at manford they have a you know a a a real good facility and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that.
A:	yeah.
B:	so it's uh uh you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
A:	yeah. yeah
B:	and i think this is really  is buyer beware.  well it is the best way  to do it interestingly.
A:	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over
B:	i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. yeah.
B:	because i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
A:	yes. and it's amazing how much good things like uh sesame street will do.
B:	it's it's phenomenal. it's phenomenal the programming the human operating system
