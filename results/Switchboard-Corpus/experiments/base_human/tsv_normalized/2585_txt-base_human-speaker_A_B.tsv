A:	hello.
B:	hello i was i was thinking about our topic for the night um immigration problems. we have immigration problems and what do do you think about it?
A:	well i think it's a very very complicated
B:	huh.
A:	and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides. um and i've have no hope for solutions. but uh i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue. i have worked with uh uh a little bit with refugees from  southeast asia uh who've come over. uh you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there. and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had. and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be. because i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and uh i'm in california  which has a lot of immigration. probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case.
B:	where are you? see well we've got a lot too. i'm in texas.
A:	uh-huh yeah.
B:	in garland right outside of dallas.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	so we're getting a large oh gosh i don't know i think there's like twenty-six different languages now that are spoken in i the i s d. dallas innercity school district.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	cambodians uh asians vietnamese. we we're getting a lot of uh mexican americans you know we've had  those for a long time.
A:	yeah. sure well texas  used to be part of mexico or most of it
B:	yes oh yes. to child in no i'm busy right now steven. steven wants me to do popcorn right now.
A:	huh.
B:	to okay. and i don't know what the solution is.
A:	i i don't either. it's a really delicate uh moral issue. because if you have well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation to  to get them on their feet.
B:	to get them on their yeah.
A:	because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people.
B:	right
A:	you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever. and i know that that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with uh feel very quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here. because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically. and they're being plunked down plunked down into america. many of them had been promised by the c i a during the war over there that because they co-operated with the c i a and they helped the c i a out that when they came here the c i a would help establish them in america and the c i a of course isn't doing that.
B:	um.
A:	and uh so they come here and they don't know what the heck they're doing. and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities. and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they're they're incredible victims of crime. and part of it is this lack of  lack of basic information being dissimilated . and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
B:	and there's a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.
A:	uh yeah exactly.
B:	yeah.
A:	i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like.
B:	right.
A:	um and it's it's i i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them. and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information they don't have. and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know. people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know. like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it. but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know. why can't they? they have no idea why not some some of them you know. the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now. but when they initially come over
B:	you mean really trying to plant something? that's what you're saying?
A:	yeah
B:	farming?
A:	'cause they're farmers. these  are all farmers coming over
B:	oh.
A:	and they're being put in the middle of the city
B:	oh that's terrible.
A:	i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war. and uh they have you know. so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the american way. because if they don't you're just going to produce you know you're going to produce an underclass you know. you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then. and there was no  real up upward movement.
B:	and not being cared for.
A:	and not being you know
B:	yeah. that's true.
A:	um
B:	well what did you do when you helped these people?
A:	well
B:	how did you what did you do
A:	i i wasn't helping them. i worked with them not to help them but for my own purposes. i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit. and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me. but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
B:	all right.
A:	i do have friends who have tried to do more  social work   you know by explaining to people how the language  and what the problems learning english might be and such.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers. and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
B:	well i'm an e s l teacher.
A:	oh you are?
B:	yes.
A:	uh-huh well you
B:	i got my certification. but actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
A:	that's that's been my impression.
B:	i mean it's like people don't know what they say
A:	yeah. it's it's not they're not withholding information
B:	it's not step for step.
A:	they just don't have that information.
B:	yeah
A:	they they haven't the foggiest idea.
B:	but anyway i enjoy it. they they the kids i've worked with so far have been spanish speaking.
A:	yes.
B:	and
A:	and spanish is  pretty close to english really.
B:	but i'm applying for what? yeah it is.
A:	and spanish is a lot like english.
B:	a lot of our words are the same
A:	yeah.
B:	like you know  they just change the pronunciation a little bit.
A:	yeah yeah. yeah.
B:	but i love it. i love the culture uh the way that they uh they respect education and their teachers their parents so much more than than my children do. you know
A:	uh-huh uh-huh. uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	and i like it. and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and doing what trying to get them set up inculturated  into the system.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	i thought that would be good experience for me.
A:	oh i'm sure it would.
B:	and i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	and i think that would be wonderful too.
A:	yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure. very much. and and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble. i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
B:	right.
A:	they became a very successful immigrant group. but and but a lot of people coming over from vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries are are not having the same success. i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful? the japanese were or the chinese were or something. and it's really much more complicated.
B:	well the times were different too.
A:	yeah the times are different yeah.
B:	my neighbor let's see is jewish. and he's going through the i don't know the jewish league or something. and helping a family that's come over from russia.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family  and help them with the language.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and he thoroughly enjoyed it.
A:	oh yeah. i i think it's a wonderful thing to do. and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it uh  more of the volunteer network service.
B:	no.
A:	because everyone gains from it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	would be would might be really useful. uh and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes makes the community so much happier.
B:	uh-huh. what's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but  their training isn't what we need in this country.
A:	uh-huh. yes.
B:	and because they're so deficient in english they haven't been able to get jobs.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	so they'll have to go back and get a degree here. you know almost start all over.
A:	yes yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country. i mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak english no one thinks anything of you.
B:	no no. and this woman was uh stocking the shelves in a drugstore.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	i feel sorry for her.
A:	yeah i do too. well it's been good talking with you.
B:	well thank you.
A:	uh okay.
B:	have a good night.
A:	okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of
B:	okay. yes i do
A:	uh okay bye-bye.
B:	okay bye.
