A:	well what i believe is one of the major uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. i agree with that.
A:	uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death about being disciplined
B:	you were?
A:	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
B:	yeah. yeah yeah. from what i understand they act up pretty bad
A:	yeah that's right that's right.
B:	what uh grade is your daughter in?
A:	my my daughter's in the um fourth grade
B:	uh-huh uh-huh.
A:	and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. yeah.
A:	and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with.
B:	oh no uh-huh. they always had a paddle in our school.
A:	uh-huh. well they they just don't do that any more.
B:	i know.
A:	but the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that.
B:	uh-huh. yeah yeah.
A:	and i also believe we don't even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
B:	yeah. wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for if we approve it?
A:	yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you know i don't know your feelings toward that. i guess we shouldn't get into that but um and what else um i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i have heard stories uh from other parents that i know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
B:	uh-huh. no. really?
A:	oh yeah
B:	ooh.
A:	i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and you know to be be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
B:	uh-huh. um.
A:	um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system. i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
B:	oh i do too i think they're doing real good job.
A:	uh-huh so.
B:	but then what do i know i don't have any kids. no none at all
A:	yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
B:	oh yeah
A:	yeah. okay well i guess um we can discontinue our call now.
B:	okay.
A:	it was a joy in talking with you.
B:	well it was good talking to you too.
A:	okay thanks.
