A:	okay, um, now the term personal computer, uh, i don't happen to have one at home. um, but i do have a personal computer on my desk here.
B:	a type of work station?
A:	yeah, uh, yeah, just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process. and, uh, it, it works just fine. it says it's a monochrome monitor, panasonic printer, uh, no big deal, it, it does the things i need for it to do.
B:	is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine?
A:	no, it's not even that.
B:	it's eighty eighty-eight?
A:	uh, i think that's about where it is.
B:	okay. uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? word processing obviously.
A:	uh, yeah, i do that, i, i do, uh, some lotus on it. uh, do some, uh, samna, some, uh, p f m, uh, nothing extremely complex.
B:	okay. uh, i use them both here at work and at home.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i have i b m clones in both cases.
A:	yep.
B:	here at work i have the t i one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
A:	oh, yeah. i bet that's a pretty nice setup.
B:	yes, it is. uh, unfortunately i need all of it.
A:	yep.
B:	uh, for example, i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
A:	wow.
B:	and that, i know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
A:	yep.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. just in the ability to handle.
A:	wow.
B:	and then i have, uh, a three eighty-six f x a sixteen bit machine, at home.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i'm really pleased with it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
A:	sure. uh-huh.
B:	uh, what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. have you,
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	to try to make them more effective and useful.
A:	right.
B:	have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
A:	well, um, i seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. when everyone was in samna i was still in p f m, and now that i finally become proficient in samna everybody's going to wordperfect. so, i can never quite stay current with that.
B:	well, i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it. it's, uh, i used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	the, at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that. of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. not a fun thing to try to recover from.
A:	oh. huh. i can i can believe that.
B:	very frustrating. uh, but again i've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. uh, that was a engineering spec on b two. you come here with the b level of specs?
A:	no, not really. i'm not that up be on that sort of thing.
B:	well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. uh, to one level down from assistant description.
A:	oh, okay. oh, okay. okay. oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
B:	well, i sure need them. uh, there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to, to try to do my job without them.
A:	i can believe that. well, it's, it's been interesting.
B:	yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. i think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. when you start seeing what all they can do for you.
A:	yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
B:	well, i understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
A:	i is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?
B:	right.
A:	that, that must be a fairly recent release.
B:	uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
A:	okay, okay. because i, i had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but i didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
B:	it does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
A:	sure. yeah.
B:	well, okay. i enjoyed our discussion.
A:	i did too, and you have a good day.
B:	you do the same.
A:	bye-bye.
B:	bye.
