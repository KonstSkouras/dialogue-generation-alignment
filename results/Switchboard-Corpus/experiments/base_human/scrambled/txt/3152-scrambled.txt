A|Yeah, right, right. Yeah, well I, I only, you know, subscribe to the things I'm interested in. I used to be into coin collecting so I used to get the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, you know. I used to get that. So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really, really want, you know.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, keep it there
B|Well, I think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, I don't know, I think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,
A|Bye-bye.
B|Tibby and Liberty.
A|Oh. Uh, I had, I had a dog one time, and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed
B|And this is before I was born.
A|Yeah.
B|Yes.
A|We would no longer need paper at all.
B|Oh, good.
A|Yeah, they, they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they, about eight months ago they gave it to us.
B|You know, I guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
A|I like it.
B|Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and I was like, I'm not eating in there Are you nuts? And, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
A|Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?
B|Oh. Oh, that's neat.
A|Yeah, yeah, she's the, she's the nice one. We, uh, we used to live in an apartment and like, our cats never went outside, but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out, and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy, and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in
B|So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
A|Right now, both of us are students.
B|but, uh, yeah
A|Probably so. Yeah, you can get a head start on it. like ice in
B|Oh, yeah.
A|you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural
B|Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.
A|Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
B|but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,
A|Huh? Okay.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I like the Moody Blues. Did you like them?
B|I grow a lot of things, a lot of food.
A|so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
B|I see.
A|Minneapolis area,
B|they, they do.
A|Uh, now color preferences, I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get
B|Uh, our, our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year.
A|Well, that's really, yeah that's, I bet that was nice.
B|So,
A|I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.
B|Uh
A|Gosh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Than we think. Sure. Sure.
B|So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty So,
A|Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.
B|and it was difficult to hold them together. And then, of course, he died two years ago, so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
A|Are you ready?
B|I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
A|and, you know, I will watch that some if I'm reading or doing something else, you know with him.
B|Uh-huh.
A|and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
B|They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about.
A|And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school, so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.
B|Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
A|And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
B|Right.
A|Yeah. But it's, I, I know.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
B|I know there's, you know, when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care, you know, you're only making like five.
A|So are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?
B|Yeah.
A|but, also most places, like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not but,
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|Oh, okay.
B|I that true, yeah. Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is, is basically a reject, somebody had bought him, and wanted him.
A|Yeah.
B|Oh, you get that stuff in the mail all the time.
A|Yeah, you know, it makes sense, um, you know, you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused, but I mean, uh, so few and far between, uh, you know, makes good T V movies and that's about it.
B|Right. Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place. You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
B|It seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
A|And, uh, it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when I hear it at other places, or when I, you know, see some, see and hear someone playing. I sort of watch their technique, too, and, and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning.
B|Uh, I don't, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,
A|Okay.
B|Uh, yes, I am. I'm working in the computer science department here uh, at C M U.
A|Yeah.
B|and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
A|Yeah
B|Well another reason, well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. We have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,
A|Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh, some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go, and it's sleeping time. But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either
B|it was real hilly.
A|Uh. Explained , *listen; could be br
B|But, uh,
A|normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
B|Well, it really isn't too big yet. We, we a lot of people say that but, um, it's,
A|She's ninety-two.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Oh, yeah, yeah.
B|I think that helps.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.
B|Right.
A|Really? Have you served on a jury?
B|Uh, cause that makes a big difference. My wife works part-time.
A|Yeah.
B|Oh, yes They're both running around now.
A|Really?
B|and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals, and I'm not talking about necessarily in the school system, I'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
A|Well, church softball leagues, so,
B|Yeah.
A|These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
B|Um, personally, I don't have a problem with it, uh, I think, uh, as far as, uh, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified. On the other hand, um, I do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work.
A|And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
B|Uh, a lot of I guess is.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh.
