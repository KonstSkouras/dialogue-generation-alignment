A|and that got to be somewhat expensive, so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount.
B|Right.
A|What. Oh, okay, maybe I'll call you back after, after the recording is finished. Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes. I can't remember.
B|You know, I don't know, or a person personally.
A|I I never did put things up when my kids were little and I haven't with them. I try to teach them not to get into things.
B|And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.
A|Right. Just wasn't socially acceptable.
B|Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me, but I can understand why people would object. So, I guess, uh, I guess, uh, I'm kind of mixed on it, still at this point.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yes, I understand that, but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
A|Oh, it was,
B|So, you know, it's, I guess you pay the piper but, Plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally, high.
A|Well, that sounds interesting. I bet he's enjoyed having it that way

A|And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
B|Yeah, well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is, is consult for, um, you know, other companies.
A|Oh. But,
B|Oh, I do not remember the man's name, he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, I think, the NEW YORK TIMES, or the WASHINGTON POST, one of the two, and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, I mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell, and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in Los Angeles.
A|No, I'm not.
B|We never could get it declared a lemon, and the car would go and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
A|Yeah.
B|and their economy is, of several of the countries, especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable. It's just a, you know, such a small amount, and it it just, it, uh, cuts off just a trickle, and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, that will be another big problem.
A|Yeah, I think it was on a Hard Copy, she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college

B|You know, people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because  they don't have the clothes to wear.

A|Yeah.
B|I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
A|Uh-huh. You'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
B|Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.

B|And, uh, I mean, it comes bedtime and she's right there.
A|Handling, power, everything. Yeah, it just got like the top rating. It was compared up against, uh, let's see, there was like the Mazda M X three, uh, Nissan's, whatever, their two, N X two thousand, the Civic S I and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them.
