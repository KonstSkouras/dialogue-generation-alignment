A|I know.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Why don't you tell me about your choir.
B|The most polluted city in the world
A|Oh, that's great, sounds like you,
B|Yeah I work here in Germantown, but I live in Pensacola, Florida.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah, Yeah.
B|No, I, I can't say that I have either. But, uh,
A|Yeah. I wish we'd,
B|and, uh, it was very aggressive.
A|So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that.
B|Ten, I was just in the middle of watching it.
A|I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
B|And keep it clean. I think that's I pretty good idea. And I think, you know, again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older. I know I did, you know, in Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
A|Yeah.
B|Do you know what that is?
A|Well I guess that will be it then and,
B|And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice, they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,
A|Yeah. You put in, um
B|Midnight.
A|Wow. All that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour.
B|Anyway.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, well, that should help.
A|Oh, I know we'll have to stay home and mow the yard
B|Exactly. You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
A|Uh-huh, section, yes, uh-huh.
B|Okay .
A|Well well, like, um, well, I can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
B|And so I go, these are the kind of people I would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say I don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.
A|Uh-huh. Sure. Sure, that happens quite a bit,
B|Well, anyway,

B|Because,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
B|Um, yeah, I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party. And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots, but, uh, my mind has gone blank. I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for
A|Uh-huh. Right. I agree with that, I agree with that. But I believe that, uh, an individual should really learn how to, to learn

A|Really.
B|Yeah, it's very, very generic.
A|Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
B|It was incredible actually
A|Uh,
B|Oh, okay
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.
A|Uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
