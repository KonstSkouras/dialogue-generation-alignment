A|Well, I have a friend who's the same way, and anything below sixty, she's just not happy but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, my husband's from Nebraska, and they have more of the four seasons.
B|Um.
A|but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal. I, some of the cases I've heard about over the years,
B|Did it change anything for you?
A|Uh-huh.
B|And what do you have.
A|Yeah.
B|it was just strange.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Yes, we've got about five of those. I love them.
B|it has to be something that's voluntary. You know, which is pretty much the way it is now. They might,
A|Oh, well that's okay, um,
B|and we had all this rain, and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool. But all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in October, uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time. And, uh, then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, you know. There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal, and then uh, into of November, the first, like the second week, uh, you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze,
A|everything has sugar in it . I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
B|Uh, and I planted potatoes too.
A|It's here now, we have to keep it. Yeah, my, my first one that I got, I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.
B|And it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,
A|Um.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, I can camp just about, most anyway Camping or, uh, motor home is nice, uh, travel trailer, pop up,
B|Yeah, we've heard them and, liked, liked it real well, of course
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
A|but it's uncomfortable
B|But, um, they're kind of old older
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
B|yes, I do.
A|Uh-huh. Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?
B|Hello.
A|Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.
B|Right.
A|Right. So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
B|Oh sure.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Well, I can tell you, that the Mets opened, I think, two days ago,
A|Right.
B|And I think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship. And they lose their constitutional rights. You know,
A|Uh-huh.
B|I kind of like to read different stuff and, uh, I like to read a novel every now and then, but, uh, I am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
A|and they are, um, of an advanced years, and when I see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid, I mean, the,  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
B|We could go around, and, boy and,
A|Now we haven't watched any of those.
B|Um, Kalachandji's. It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
A|I,
B|Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.
A|I think, Yes.
B|and I, I think there's an attempt to do that. You know, I think people, there's a mild attempt for that, but I think basically, we basically associate news with bad news or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.
A|Well, he could always get past, you know, he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. But, um, I guess you never could really see him play, because with the Cowboys, while he was with the team, the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team. But, I don't know.
B|Oh, uh-huh.
A|Yes.
B|It comes from trees. How can it be bad?
A|Uh, we have no basement I don't know,
B|But,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, uh-huh. Yeah, I, I like some of his songs, though. They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. They're just kind of sweet sometimes.
A|and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
B|and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything, you know, all out in this, in the, in this schoolyard there. So we just said, hey, let's stop and and the kids got to go around and, you know, see pigs and animals and things like that,
A|Yeah, that's good.
B|Oh.
A|Yeah.
B|And unfortunately the the, lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.
A|I guess, I'm, I'm a student right now and I don't make a whole lot of money and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long. My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything, but, uh, I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a,
B|Right, the, yeah
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. So, that is pretty much for right now, that is, what I have been reading.
A|Right, right.
B|You can't get away from it so I think, To some point,
A|Really. I usually have, too .
B|Well, it sounds like a good buy.
A|Yeah, are they, um, just house pets?
B|Uh-huh?
A|About quality.
B|Uh-huh
A|Tried to get fondue and white wine, and that was,
B|Himself and her?
