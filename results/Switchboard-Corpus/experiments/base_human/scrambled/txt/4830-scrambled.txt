A|Uh-huh.
B|Right.
A|Right.
B|Oh, well they'll, weed him out.
A|All right?
B|Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant and that's what I know, so, and, uh, just nothing basically
A|Oh, yeah. Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
B|Very much so, except when we need them. You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.
A|and, um, I find great disgust in them, in their, in their, um, their self-centeredness and their inability to understand, um, multicultural or multiracial situation
B|So we put a three car garage in.
A|Oh, I bet,
B|But not cats.
A|Uh, State of Minnesota.
B|And then just bake it, and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.
A|sure. Yeah.
B|Good, good, that's great. Yeah. Well, good luck.
A|We wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that.
B|And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.
A|And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
A|Yeah. Yeah, they I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, uh, in Colorado. Because, uh, I, I think about that a lot. But, you know, when I first moved here was when they, well, no, I guess it was about a year ago they did this. This interstate seventy-five song. Or whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|have you ever been there?
B|Uh-huh. Well that's,
A|Oh, okay.
B|Uh-huh. Well, you need to, uh, teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
A|I would love, I can hardly wait to get up there.
B|Oh, is that right?
A|Yeah, well,
B|I think that they should be put away.
A|But, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, I can just have anything I want. And I just don't see it like that. Of course, I always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover, that's what you have, but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that, but I can't stand owing. I mean, I cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know, I guess it's just because I've been brought up like that. But, um, I could not charge to the limit and knowing that I was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout. But, that's just the way I feel about it.
B|Um.
A|Yeah.
B|I guess those are the only places I've skied up there.

A|or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.
B|when I was growing up we had cats and, you know, just seeing the cats, you know, the, the miracle of birth, you know, put that in quotes, is that's a, that's a neat thing to, to experience as a kid and understand,
A|Um.
B|You think so?
A|And he's their head chauffeur, is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.
B|All right.
A|I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and, and then force upon them, uh,
