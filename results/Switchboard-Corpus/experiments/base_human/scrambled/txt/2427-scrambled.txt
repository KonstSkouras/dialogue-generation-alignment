A|Well, uh, I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers, and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective. Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far. And the young people are overly impressed. And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.
B|Yeah. I, uh, I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that,
A|Well,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah.
B|and so. I found that really helps.
A|Uh-huh.
B|You know, they're not going to sit there and lose money. If they are losing money, then they're going to raise rates.
A|But it's nice having a dog here, uh, the,
B|But, I mean, that's going to tend to, I mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit. The real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
A|Exactly.
B|It's a long skinny one and,
A|I don't let that worry me. And I get the milk lukewarm and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and I have this thing it's called the slender blender, it, it makes the, uh, it makes, uh, a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough. It's, uh, I don't know, they're called moo goo leaves or something they're
B|Yeah. Well, I'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying. They're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
A|Well, I I just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists, and everything else, just walking the streets. You know?
B|Exactly,
A|What's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't, you know, we take the time to, you know, help my daughter, she's in college,
B|Right. Yeah.
A|Uh-huh.
B|So,
A|True, true.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh,
A|Well, I don't know if I know anything or not,
B|We do that too, we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind of stuff, we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week, you know.
A|Seventeen years.
B|Right, and then you get to their life story, Oh, they came from a broken family
A|And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision I think.
B|That's great.
A|Yeah.
B|so, um,
A|And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or,
B|And perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.
A|I would imagine it is.
B|it, it was around there generally.
A|And you don't want to?
B|I know and see a credit card
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though. want to just, you know, all your salary can't even begin  to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know in a major illness or something. Uh.
A|And, not being, you know,
B|Huh.
A|Uh-huh. I think that's right,
B|Right.
A|Yeah. Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I, I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. Let's, let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary I'd, you know, I, Yeah, we, we do. We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.
A|Uh-huh. So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through appeals.
B|A bit
A|I just think that everybody ought to do it.
B|Were you up in, in Wisconsin or would you go into where would you camp ?
A|Exactly. Exactly.
B|Were any of them twins?
A|Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
B|Yeah our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to, let's see, now, I forget which way we do it. We don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,
A|That would be really awful.
B|Right, yeah.
A|Oh my gosh. People are crazy.
B|Well, do you exercise regularly, Judy?
A|that's entering the day as well.
B|I think five minutes is the max.
A|And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so I can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so.
B|and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.
A|Oh my gosh.
B|I'm sorry, we are not getting rid of the cats.
A|Well, yeah. Yeah.
B|The west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so.
A|so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. So it's I don't know. It's very it's it's uh you know It's a it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a,
B|Yeah, and I like it.
A|but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card. And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh, well, I'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.
B|But,
A|but certainly not,
B|Hi.
A|So that's a difficult situation.
B|No, I would agree with you. We haven't had too much, but, uh, historically, we've always, uh, almost been like a big brother to, in, and to the Latin American area, and, uh, almost used them, I, I, I feel.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Um yeah. Yeah.
B|I think technology is better, I'm, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
A|So, I don't, I don't even know who your favorite team is, actually.
B|Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.
A|so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.
A|Wow. Yeah.
B|well, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped
A|Oh no.
B|Uh-huh. Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it and,
A|Okay, um, what baseball team are you familiar with?
B|And, uh, I, I think it's coming up here soon.
A|Right.
B|Is that right? I've never heard of that.
A|Yeah
B|And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect. And they bred a dog that I it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you. That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them, because they would turn on on their handlers.
A|Well, that's, Yeah.
B|So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
A|Yes.
B|Johnny Elway.
A|and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush.
B|Yeah, they were.
A|Huh-uh.
B|Uh-huh, yeah.
A|now I noticed just the other day in the paper that, that Medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness. So I
B|when they rollback an hour.
A|Uh, they classify most of them as professionals.
B|Twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky. I wouldn't do it for that.
A|I know that, that Uh-huh. And, I don't know. Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?
B|Uh-huh.
A|uh, look at them, in England, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, uh, Indira Ghandi , uh, in India,
B|You too.
A|Yeah, I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh, he's not the only one,  you know,
B|Oh, yeah.
A|Yeah, it is hard
B|I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
A|You miss the whole thing.
B|Yeah. Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me. I mean I was just, you know,
A|Yeah, that's fun. Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Well, I guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here
B|It's not, not to me personally, no.
A|Is that right? That's it?
B|And it's, Well, they certainly are living off our at our expense.
A|One little ball here and there, yeah, and this guy's beating you up, so, I don't know the beating up part. I, I actually feel the tennis balls would hurt.
B|His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for for her daddy,
A|Gee.
B|Uh-huh. You bet.
A|I mean I don't know. All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know. Uh, or maybe they understand but,
B|Farming?
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh, well, that's great, that'd be a lot of fun. You have a lot good experiences from that. Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Wow.
B|Right.
A|See those type of people that, that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything
B|How about you? Do you pay too much?
A|Of course, you know, it is so weird, cause no one will ever really know, it's, it, so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things.
B|Oh. Oh, that sounds so pretty.
A|I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.
B|And it's not a city, not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, I can't even see their house and, uh,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah. Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.
A|and, and, in spite of,
B|That sounds like it would hurt more.
A|so they think, well, you know, why vote.
B|That's kind of sad. Well, anyway.
A|and, um, going over that pass is just a real nightmare.
B|Wow,
A|there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
B|And, uh, kids kind of, they want the, they want the fun part and not the, not the work.
A|Bye now.
B|Oh, we've got, well the two that were outside, they're like brothers, I mean I've never seen two cats so close.
A|worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
A|you're definitely right,
B|My wife would love that
A|and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. So, I
B|you too.
A|Uh-huh.
B|You know, they buy a place and they just hate the area.
A|So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah.
A|The Utah Jazz.
B|and, um, so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored, and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time,
A|Yeah. Yeah, well, I am, I'm a big football fan. I never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and I just hated it. And I think I was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays.
B|No, sometimes we ride and sometimes, uh, we, pull, we like to, to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise. But
A|Yeah, isn't it funny.
B|Okay Uh, I've, the high school I went to was, uh, was a good one also. And I, well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. Because the one I went to was, you know, I'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta.
A|Um, I'm a co-op student so I work and go to school about halftime. And, uh, I really don't have any job benefits to speak of. We're kind of, um, I don't know, they just kind of forget us on that end. We don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really so.
B|Yeah.
A|And so it's a, it's kind of a depressing topic though. How old are you?
B|I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
A|and, uh, so, and Sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on Sunday, so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos
B|Yeah, it's really neat. And, uh, uh, course I've been working on it for five years, but, you know,
A|Uh-huh.
B|so my brother's wife and my husband and I went. Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non-American you want to see what a baseball game is like.
A|And, uh, so, we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory, and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
B|so you've been all through Europe.
A|I'm not sure what it is there. Now, I know what it is in Singapore, is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it,
B|I grew up next door to, uh, the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader so,
A|And they always have surprises for you.
B|and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,
A|in fact, I think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
B|Very old, uh, historical place there.
A|Yeah, I think there's a limit on that. The, uh, the, uh peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many,
B|It just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree.
A|Oh, sure, yeah.
B|and she didn't eat. She ate very poor so I think she was, you know, bad, uh, nutrition on top of it. And, uh, she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore. So,
A|That's interesting. Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, yeah Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling
B|Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
A|And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.
B|Exactly what happened to them.
A|I know so, I felt kind of sorry for him. that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but, um, I never , a major owner of our of the team here.
B|You know, it be, it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.
A|Yeah.
B|Well I think it should be permitted under certain
A|both, yeah, both females, they're both spayed, um, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, um,
B|And she got kind of fearful of being on her own. She never really ate very well. It was one thing. She hardly  ever took care of herself
A|Right.
B|uh, I don't know how expensive they are. It sounds like that it would probably,
A|Uh-huh.
B|And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.
A|Uh, go ahead, tell me what you think. Do we get our money's worth?
B|Right.
A|Well, uh, I think she's mostly German Shepherd. Uh, she was, uh, uh, a person lives across the street from me, uh, brought her home from work because a coworker of hers, uh, had this dog appear on its front doorstep,
B|Yeah. I'm anxious some day to have one here.
A|Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,
B|It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work. My mother's a school teacher and when, when we started, uh, having kids, she had to work for a little while, but then she just started substituting.
A|Uh, no but I think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money. If somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.
B|We don't use the radio as a wake up, we have our, a television connected to a, uh, uh, electronic alarm, uh, system that kicks in,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Okay. Go ahead.
A|Andrews?
B|Okay.
A|Oh gosh.
B|Yeah.
A|And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,
B|Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|I mean I don't even have to pay.
B|the only girl.
A|and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line
B|And, but they have two children, too, and they, they bought what they could afford.
A|Uh-huh.
B|so, yeah.
A|Yeah, yeah. Um, I I'm a, a writer by profession and, uh, when, when I was first here in, in Dallas or in Plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. And I was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and I got an I B M Selectric. I thought I had died and gone to heaven because I thought, oh, they're so wonderful.
B|Four bedrooms?
A|Yeah, I think we usually have a frost in October.
B|Yeah, everybody's got that.
A|Oh, yeah.
B|But, uh, uh, he, and he does a good job and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.
A|Yeah, after, well when it starts steaming a lot, uh, I definitely, yeah, put it in the refrigerator,
B|and so, uh, that, it's kind of a seasonal thing. Three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business,
A|Oh, what are their names?
B|Unlike a car where it's running.
A|And, It's really more of a, um, like a respect issue that the older, older people in other countries that I've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and, and they really seem as wise and, and in this country nobody really, Yeah, nobody really pays attention
B|And while he was gone, he had looked, went looking for a job and stopped at the store, that's what it was. And, uh, someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets, these two men, went in, raped the girl, murdered her, and the whole bit.
A|Huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah. What, what deterrent does he really have?
B|Absolutely.
A|Uh-huh. That's right.
B|Uh-huh. What, what kind of work do you do?
A|So for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
B|Uh, it depends. It, it's, has decent national coverage, but has an extremely focused political coverage, probably steeped in,  the southern history and the fact that this is a Democratic State.
A|I'm from Atlanta.
B|And, uh, you know, we had a case like that here and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, uh, penalties can be very severe, they, uh, there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.
A|I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.
B|therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
A|Well, I'm in a, I'm in an urban area. I'm in Dallas.
B|And I have never had a chance to, I have been in cars that have had them, but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, uh, you know, on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around.
A|Yeah, the press has a lot of power.
