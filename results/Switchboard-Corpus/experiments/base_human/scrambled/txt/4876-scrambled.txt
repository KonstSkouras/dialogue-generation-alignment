A|To, to compensate for some of the benefits.
B|What about Mustang G T
A|And we've got grandchildren now, so when they come, they have to have a place.
B|Well, I know that we have some relatives that live around, like the area in there,
A|Yeah, well, a cat will do the same trick
B|Morocco. Really.
A|I have a, most of my friends,
B|Yeah, that is what I have heard.
A|Uh-huh.
B|I like the heat.
A|Really? I,
B|I'd like to try, you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|It might have a new name.
B|Oh, yes. Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, sure.

A|Oh, that's good.
B|Yes, uh-huh. I mean you can't help but love her. She's, she's the oldest one and, but, uh, very possessive.
A|You know. We just got our phone back today, uh, and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer, or to have their organizations come, volunteer to help clean up the streets.
B|Okay Carol. So, air quality.
A|See, I've only been to Texas once. I have two sisters in Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas, and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this

A|Yeah, Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.

B|That, uh,
A|Yeah
B|Um, uh-huh, um. Yeah, yeah, that's nice. You say have your four year old taking lessons already?
A|Yeah.

B|Right.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet. And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier
B|Yeah.
A|Really?
B|Oh, it's good and it's healthy, too.
