A|It really makes an effort on, to, do this anymore.
B|That's, what kind of fondue, the cheese dip or,
A|Right. Right. Uh-huh. Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.
B|With baseball tickets.
A|I know it, I know it.
B|Right, that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you involved real good and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
A|Thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets. See, they, they sectioned it out even more. They used to just have like, uh, first of all it was all one price. And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. And now they're sectioning it off to like from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one, just on the lower levels is the highest price, and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level, and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. And then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas, and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end, the direct end zones. But, um, they have about four or five different prices now, that they're structuring it with, but obviously yeah, they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do.
B|Right.
A|Uh, go ahead.
B|and.
A|and, and they do group things. And then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh, I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in. It's really kind of difficult.
B|I have some
A|Not that I was looking for sports cars, but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
B|Is it really?
A|Um. Boy I like that.
B|judge
A|Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
B|Surely,  there's and end to, the situation.
A|Okay, there's one, uh, I meant living in Texas, where you at?
B|I don't remember one, from one station to another. I keep forgetting one station. What's your second favorite?
A|That's interesting.
B|Really? Huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient.
A|And, you know, he and his wife just went off to visit her and, you know, I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.
B|Yes.
A|Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
B|Did puppy go to?
A|Oh, well, anyway. Uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
B|That, I mean, that makes a big difference cause I wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that.
A|Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|The cat was here first so I know, it's hard.
B|Oh, are you? I don't care for that as much.
A|Yes. Right.
B|and we all know one another and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.
A|Yeah.
B|bye.
A|Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt.
B|Oh, really
A|and he got to do it and so God just really blesses him in ways like that, do trust God because, I don't know, kids are a blessing and, and some people you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that, but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think, oh, well, I'm not blessed I have an old car. But you've got five kids, you know,
B|and it is hysterical, I mean and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. It's like this train.
A|Uh-huh.
B|No.
A|My husband has taken us to work with him, and we still don't know what he does.
B|I'm only twenty-nine.
A|Yeah.
B|Oh, ho-ho.
A|The black bear.
B|So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.
A|and the extraordinary amounts, I know that, because those people vote, I mean, they're the ones who get out and vote, that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. The young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, I think,
B|Yeah, yeah. How long has it been since the first one?
A|because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
B|Huh. I see. I know this isn't on our topic, but where did you grow up in California?
A|Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Are you going to move your whole family over there then?
B|You're kidding! No kidding! Uh-huh.
A|Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually, um, the, the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
B|Yeah. I haven't heard a thing.
A|Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that. They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight and this is under something but,
B|Uh, oh, golly, I really.
A|Yeah. Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Okay, I mean like business programs or, Man.
B|Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
A|Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
B|Uh-huh. I see.
A|right, near Dayton, Ohio, and he said, you know, he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
B|Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever.
A|I imagine.
B|This is one, this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Cambodians, uh, Asians, Vietnamese. We, we're getting a lot of, uh, Mexican Americans, you know, we've had,  those for a long time.
A|Uh, in parts. I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.
B|Wow.
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah.
B|No, uh,
A|In Richardson?
B|Right. Right. But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh, we have, uh, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix.
A|But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?
B|Hi.
A|Uh-huh.
B|That's really interesting, I've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat.
A|Right.
B|I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too. Like, uh
A|A train of cats running around.
B|you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.
A|Yeah.
B|There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.
A|Right. Oh.
B|Yeah.
A|You think? I don't know, well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,
B|and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
A|Well, we enjoyed having her here,
B|Uh-huh. No, even that, that really, I think, I don't, it's been awhile since I've looked at, my youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers. But they are
A|and my husband and I actually met in a computer company. Um, I was a tech writer and he was an engineer. And, uh, so I did tech writing for a number of years.
B|The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
A|you can, you know, you can get some of us,
B|Okay.
A|Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia and I used to go up and visit her.
B|That's true. paper
A|Well,
B|But it, it makes a great, I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it.
A|Uh-huh. Um. Well.
B|and,
A|Uh-huh.
B|and,
