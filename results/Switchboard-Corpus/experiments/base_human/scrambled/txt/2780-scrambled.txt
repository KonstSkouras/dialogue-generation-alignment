A|Baseball has started.
B|I think,
A|Yeah, you do a lot more area than I do. I've, all the rest of my yard, backyard is, uh, you know, pool and decking it's all the dirt I have, left in my backyard
B|Well, it's, uh, it's really both. I'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, and, uh, and most of the time I enjoy it. Sometimes I don't, but I feel that, uh, that the discipline it affords me when I do it when I don't want to is also worth something.
A|Anyway, it's a tough question.
B|Yeah.
A|my mother got a piano and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, so we all had to take lessons, and I was the one that did the least poorly, so she gave it to me. And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. It is real relaxing.
B|Yeah, well, you know,
A|I've tried to do that with sugar
B|And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison.
A|The, the investigator. Yeah, he, he got off right away.
B|And we got, uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.
A|Uh-huh.
B|So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
A|So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Um, I forget how she got it, but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it, I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department.
B|Jerry Burns.
A|And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
B|and the average, you know, the average, uh, first frost is like the fifteenth of November here
A|I think that was just a regulation that was up for comment, but we'll see what happens.
B|So he hasn't really gotten into, um, that yet. They have choir that they go to, you know, music class that they go to
A|Well, um, actually it, we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
B|That's really true.
A|No, not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
B|Oh.
A|If it finally gets to that point.
B|and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.
A|Who is that?
B|Right. Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?
A|Um.
B|and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
A|Well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz, I guess I got too many hobbies so I never have time to deal with them.
B|So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat, but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.
A|Yeah.
B|Okay.
A|and we've, we have been to Whistler in Canada, which is just a marvelous place, Whistler and Black Home is in Canada, and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times, that's a, just a great place. But no not in Colorado since I was in college, since I went to school,
B|Well, good talking to you too. Bye,
A|he's gone three weeks right now and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,
B|Uh, and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of Raleigh than, than the paper would have anyway.
A|Great. Yeah.
B|Right. Uh-huh Oh Now that's a big win.
A|Yes
B|yeah, we used to, that's one of the, um, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
A|You feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
B|We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|but, uh, that's about it there.
B|well yeah, I don't, I don't care for the smell of the litter box so my cat was trained to go outside, other than that it was inside when it wanted to be, it was outside when .
A|And in talking to the people from France he said, you know, he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is. And they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
B|Well, um, I, uh, exercise regularly. I work at a university, and I swim almost every day upwards of a mile,
A|Yeah. On that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the Amelia Earhart story, whatever happened with her?
B|Uh,
A|And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
B|Oh, that was good. Utah, I've had a couple of, but that was it.
A|So, um, well, I have not really paid much attention because I clock, although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C
B|and, and I think, you know,
A|That's the part that scares me, you know. I mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals, well no, it's for homosexuals and gays, well no, actually, it's, I mean, you know. Did they know that all along?
B|Uh-huh.
A|And, uh, I don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people, because I'm sure that some of them don't, uh, don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves, so, uh, I, I have a feeling, since I have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get, that this, uh, then becomes an obligation of the government, because it's going to become an obligation of either state, local or federal government, anyway.
B|But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
A|and I think the last one I read like that was Scott Thurow's and that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.
B|Oh, really.
A|Yeah, I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.
B|Yeah.
A|And who, how about you?
B|And so I,
A|Uh-huh.
B|I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.
A|So.
B|But, I love it. I love the culture, uh, the way that they, uh, they respect education and their teachers their parents, so much more than, than my children do. You know,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh yes. But, uh, we wouldn't we wouldn't have them, I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.
A|Uh, some veggies in it.
B|and, and for them that's wonderful, you know. They, they thought it was the greatest fun, you know, and it didn't cost any money. And, uh, you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.
A|Yep, they, a lot of, um, of a, um, winter produce comes from South America.
B|So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
A|Yeah, yeah.
B|Yeah. I'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent, I think people know that nobody, that it doesn't, you know, it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective.
A|but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these. I mean, it's just beautiful. It's like a custom, you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins. You know, I mean, it's modern it's,
B|so.
A|That's great.
B|Right, that's true. Or even have you ever seen where they, they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out, and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
A|But my husband does and, uh, I think one of the, uh, my, first of all, always salary and the second thing is, uh, because we have children, so it would be, uh, health benefits and medical benefits and and, uh, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.
B|But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy
A|We don't, we don't do enough. I know we don't so Uh, although lately I've been, uh, a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and it's, it's, it's, uh, interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me, uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but I can kind of tell it bothers her so, just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper plates and paper cups and I don't do that anymore. I don't know why, I just don't I just, just from socializing with her so.
B|Oh, I think it would, it would be a lot of work but, um, you know, because it's, you know,
A|I know, and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady, but it's still not going up.
B|But, with the three children um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
A|Uh-huh.
B|And where do you go?
A|and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions. And, you know, it's I, I'm not saying that I do either but you know, it's just funny
B|Wow. Uh-huh.
A|Yeah. And the quality of life really isn't there.
B|I believe that's true, yes.
A|Yeah, uh, yeah, just kind of, it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to, to, uh, shall we say bypass the formal procurement process. And, uh, it, it works just fine. It says it's a monochrome monitor, Panasonic printer, uh, no big deal, it, it does the things I need for it to do.
