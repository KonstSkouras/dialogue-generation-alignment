A|Well, I do, too, I do, too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
B|And, uh and the, yeah, younger one is, uh, uh, the sports one and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite
A|well, about nursing homes, and, and older people.
B|Uh-huh. Okay, so they know that. And that's ...
A|Uh, and, uh, so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T. So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution.
B|Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
A|Yeah. Yeah, we, uh, we've got, you know, I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
B|Uh-huh. Yes. That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.
A|Right.
B|Emmett Smith.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, yeah, an injection,
A|Yeah, yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|Wow.
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to.
B|Yeah. I've, I've heard some, I mean I've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. I mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.
A|Yeah.
B|Well, they were, I was watching some show the other day, and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers
A|Well, you're really not too bad. Yeah.
B|but.
A|Right, right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|But, uh, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
B|Yeah. That's true. And they won't raise our taxes.
A|What are your cats' names.
B|Right, no, they don't. I should make you ,
A|Um.
B|Yeah. I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary. I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases, and, uh, I mean whether,
A|yeah Uh-huh.
B|Very interesting.
A|Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
B|Some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff
A|Okay, bye-bye.
B|Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know, remodeled.
A|Oh, how sweet.
B|Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up.
A|and when I went to school that just wasn't put up with.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh, we've got plenty, in fact, we've got far too many. You're in, uh, what Flower Mound?
B|And, uh, I think that we're paying too much because I don't have any children.
A|you know, stupid guys And, uh, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.
B|Then I think it makes a big difference.
A|and it is too far south for me,
B|You know. That's just, that's my views, you know.
A|Yes. That, that was true for mine too. Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.
B|because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. She just,
A|I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard. I, I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um. Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, but, I, I don't think that's done much anywhere That's kind of drastic punishment.
B|But, uh, they want too much money.
A|Yeah. Yeah.
B|Oh, no.
A|Well, what about random testing, though.
B|And then I have my freedom. I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
A|Well, we have a funny commercial around here. It says something like, if people were to give five, hours a week or five percent of their salary, we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something. So,  I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could, uh,
B|Yeah. I'm down here at T I.
A|Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it
B|they don't warp.
A|and
B|I can't believe they have the nerve to do that.
A|I like that.
B|Okay. Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously.
A|But,
B|Oh, okay. Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball?
A|the economy around here is real poor
B|Right.
A|Have you?
B|and did it again and, uh,
A|Yeah, um.
B|What's the topic?
A|And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. You start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.
B|and I, I don't think I'll do it again
A|Um, but,
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|and I feel like I would never put them in a home. But I wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.
B|and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
A|Yeah. Yeah, are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
B|I haven't bought it now for about eight years. But when I used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three hundred of them advertising.
A|We had, uh, we had organizations like that in college, you know. We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that, some did elderly visits,
B|Yeah, yeah, it's getting real close to
A|Well, good.
B|Chili.
A|Sounds like you have a little one just like I do
B|Well, I think that in some cases, it is warranted.
A|No
B|It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist. It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever
A|Well, um, I was a technical writer for many years, um,
B|Right.
A|Now how do you mean that? I know it,
B|You know, I, it's going just for the sake of getting together, I think for the family. And,
A|so. Uh, do
B|uh, it use to be use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,
A|Okay
B|Yeah, uh, it's, Yeah, there, you, you know, usually there's, uh, I have a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas, and you know, all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine, you know, it's that same trees, pines and, and hard woods, you know hickories and oaks and stuff,
A|Yeah, what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
B|Now uh Well I I still go back to ...
A|But these people obviously weren't.
B|I hate to put it quite that way.
A|Great.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Sure did.
A|Oh, out of As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
B|And so, and in the book, you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. And, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth. And, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
A|Who do you think? The Dallas Cowboys.
B|Well, so, so . So, your wife, does she work right now?
A|Yeah, well I'm planning a, and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
B|Uh-huh.
A|and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.
B|And, and I asked them, you know, these are the ages of the kids, what do I get. And they all said, Golden Retriever and I said okay, put it under twenty pounds. And the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a,
A|I've seen that. Yeah.
B|Yeah. That's true.
A|No, huh-uh. Uh, I think they're interesting.
B|Well I'm not talking about any loss. I was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. And then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. But it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their,  negligence.   For gross wanton negligence in a claim.
A|Um. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, lots of their picture and life story and everything.
B|But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
A|I'll let you go first.
B|Yeah. Definitely I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
A|yeah, and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up you know, I just was there, you know, like I'm loaded, I'm here, you know, and, uh, it was just kind of funny because, you know, but we got to sit by first base if they did hit a ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Seems like I just bought it.
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, they're not worth a year. Or some people just, just can't even afford it, you know, whatever. I mean, the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well. You know?
B|it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, in this state.
A|Uh,
B|Heavy science. Are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that or is it more, um, applied physics?
A|But the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that.
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A|I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.
B|Yeah, yeah.
A|Uh-huh.
B|So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.
A|and then,
B|hopefully, it's not my wife.
A|Uh-huh. So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.
B|Right, would you use that for city driving and racing?
A|Um, I have no idea.
B|Yeah. So I think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
A|Probably. Oh.
B|Rome, New York, yeah.
A|Not for the price?
B|Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school. I, uh, I am a graduate student so, I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I wear too much of the time. Which is nice.
A|Yeah.
B|Yeah.
A|That's not too bad. That's north.
B|How do we usually?
A|Okay,
B|the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh,
A|I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
B|Yeah, well, of course in the, uh, I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
A|Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.
B|I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
A|Well, I don't know, uh, we'll see how that goes.
B|Because I, since I came from, my father has, uh, five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters. So I both of my parents had big families, and we always we always got together, just always. Now it's different because I live here and I, you know, when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can but it's real different.
A|Oh really.
B|Yeah, I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, uh, don't travel too much .
A|Uh, but,
B|No, that's right.
A|And we only have one. We tore all the rest of them up.
B|and, you know, a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for. And, uh,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,
A|Yeah.
B|and I totaled them all up and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
A|they paid fifty-eight for it.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh-huh.
B|I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,
A|and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh, and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
B|Anyway. You don't have children?
A|yeah. Uh-huh.
B|and why?
A|It is, uh-huh.
B|Uh-huh.
