A|Really.
B|he said his .
A|Yeah, it is. Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
B|Oh, okay. I see.
A|Yeah.
B|Then I think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
A|Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about.
B|but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
A|That's really stupid.
B|Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
A|Um.
B|And, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Now the interior, okay, I don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.
A|And,
B|you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
A|Yeah. She's perfect. Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Right, right.
B|Yeah.
A|Uh-huh. probably right, if you look at it from that stand point.
B|but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and,  that can happen.
A|Yeah. Well, the Cardinals, I don't know. I think the Cowboys probably have a, a better team. They just, at the end of the season, the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt, because, uh, Laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all. Of course, he sat along the sidelines all season, he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.
B|Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.
A|we better have him do do something. You know, educationally.
B|Well, uh, okay. Now that's inside again, right?
A|Well, Nola I have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly. This is really going to be fun I think,
B|So what's a guy to do?
A|No kids,
B|The, Yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
A|What do you have
B|Me too.
A|Um. Uh-huh. Well, you always have castration
B|Yeah.
A|No, because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever. They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver and they, they form it, and they make it look like roast beef, and I said, no, thank you.
B|Do you read a newspaper?
A|Well, we were there when they had a
B|because they let them back out again, and they do the same thing over,  and over,  again,
A|Right. Right.
B|Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,
A|Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts, so .
B|Yeah.
A|Yeah, you have to
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
B|Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
A|that's true. But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.
B|Oh, really?
A|because I was already in Hong Kong and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride.
B|But we don't farm.
A|Yeah, that's true.
B|Yeah.
A|Okay.
B|How about yourself?
A|Good-bye.
B|but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
