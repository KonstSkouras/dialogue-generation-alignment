A|Over a very long period of time.
B|And, and I felt, uh, very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually.
A|and it's it's a very good point.
B|Was it hot?
A|Okay. Yeah.
B|Right.
A|Yeah, it's really sad.
B|An Escort definitely was not among them. In fact, there wasn't an American car in there.
A|Yeah. Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
B|Yeah.
A|Me to. Bye, bye.
B|Yeah, well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
A|Huh.
B|And, uh, well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, I mean, to the asphalt, we're out there.
A|That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
B|You know, it's, it's, basically you've heard everything
A|Yeah.
B|Huh. Uh-huh.
A|Oh, really.
B|Right. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden  shouldn't be placed on the consumer.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Oh, that's too much trouble. That's too much trouble. Didn't want to cook.
A|Yes, now we have watched some things on that.
B|I guess I, I want to see if there's anything I really want to see there, so I don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, I tend to go to my premium channels first,
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Definitely seen it on, on, during the day down there , and I don't think it's a very violent show, I think it's funny. I think it's a real good concept, I think it's something completely new.
B|Oh.
A|So,
B|So it seems to me that while those changes are taking place, maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
A|Yeah.
B|Oh, really.
A|Oh, okay. Well, I know that a lot of young people, you know, I, it took me a long time to get it through my child's head, I mean, that was her goal, you know, uh, got to have a credit card,
B|Have I?
A|Uh-huh.
B|I don't have one in my home here. My, um, parents have one and they live just about three miles away,
A|Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like. Nothing. Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,
B|It's, I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over here.
A|Yeah. Yeah.
B|Um, actually, when I was younger, I was a Cardinal fan, too.
A|And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, I, you know, I have interests that, too,
B|It would be good I think,
A|but I've enjoyed talking to you.
B|You know, in case,  you know, in case you ever need to bail out
A|Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish,  gifts as,  we had done before.
B|Yeah that's,
A|Ooh, do you?
B|And electric windows, and power locks
A|So, you see,
B|She appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to, uh, not be able to be in her apartment on her own.
A|What, what type of area is that,
B|Is it a two eighty-six or three eighty-six base machine?
A|Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas, but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
B|I've skied in Colorado and we usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper, you know.
A|Well,
B|Yeah. Maybe, maybe that. Yeah.
A|No. Not really.
B|It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
A|Oh, then you have, yeah. Do you have a lot of land or,
B|and it's a fairly large one to, heave it up into the back of the van, bring it home and, check it back and just grab it, you know, if I, just go to my garage and grab it.
A|I know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. You know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything.
B|Oh no, they're just, they're, they're just, uh, they're wonderful, uh.
A|Uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder
B|Well, I, it just depends. Uh, uh, roads are very expensive, uh, commodity and so is, uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, uh, you know, they need to make a living.
A|you know? I'm not saying innocent person, let's say someone wrote a hot check, for instance. You know, it seems like when they go to prison, it, they really seem like it's a rough time for them
B|Uh-huh.
A|the plants and,
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A|Uh, you know,
B|Yeah, I think so. I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
A|Uh-huh.
B|Uh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Have a good night.
A|don't tell me what to do, you know.
B|You think? I, I I'm not really familiar with how other countries,
A|Yeah.
B|I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore
A|And it's nice but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten, and now she can't sell it. And our neighbors,
B|Oh, really.
A|Yes.
