A|Uh-huh.
B|No, because if you go back there, then you can never get out.
A|We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
B|and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
A|so. So it gives you idea that,
B|That's right.
A|Let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over. Ah, yeah, we had a, uh, a turkey loaf.
B|well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.
A|Um,
B|I think, I think Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because I'm from, uh,  from Pennsylvania also, just, uh, just outside,  of Philadelphia,
A|Right.
B|Uh-huh.
A|So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, okay, your talking about
B|Right. So, I think we find out what's happening in the city, uh, on a fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
A|Yeah.
B|You bet.
A|Right.
B|Right. Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh.
A|Yeah Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
B|Oh.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Right.
A|Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
B|How did you, what did you do,
A|Long way, uh,
B|Well, that's true, and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,
A|You don't want the government to spend your money. You want to be able,
B|Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is.
A|Yeah.
B|Uh-huh, that's right, they pull the strings.
A|Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at eight o'clock here, that wouldn't start at seven. We have, um, at seven o'clock we just have, um, the, they'll play, you know, they have old reruns of CHEERS or something from seven to seven thirty, and then something else from seven thirty to eight
B|Oh, which state is that?
A|Uh-huh.
B|What kind of crimes would you use it for?
A|That's life, that's how life goes.
B|Uh-huh.
A|and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really, I mean they're, they're happier when we're around but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves, um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
B|We don't regret paying taxes. We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.
A|Uh, well, no, I can't really complain. I'm a student, um, and I I work as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute. And, uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes and, uh, and, uh,  one of my parents is still claiming me.
B|So, we will play either out there or at Firewheel. That is usually where we play, but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area.
A|Right.
B|Uh-huh. Um, I see.
A|Uh-huh.
B|We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit and then we take them, take them in.
A|Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
B|Oh, wow.
A|Well, yeah. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill.
B|They got that, uh, what is that safer soap, uh, B T spray this, year.
A|Oh.
B|Yeah. I, I've always liked that. The, you know, I, we don't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back.
A|So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages. I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it
B|Uh-huh.
A|You don't sound like you're in the north. You sound like you're in the south somewhere.
B|Oh, I do too
A|uh,
B|Uh, well, I don't actually live in the city, but I'd probably say that's roughly right. I mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life, but I, I think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff I'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs.
A|Uh-huh, major.
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A|Sure. Let somebody get something out of it.
B|but there's probably something else that might make you. Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury.
A|Uh-huh.
B|Well, a little bit for the price,
A|Right, yeah, I'm a graduate student and, let's face it, I don't make any money so,
B|Uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy. There's, nothing bothers them. Their leaves are still green, and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves. Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit, but they still look pretty good.
A|Right. And then do it all over again. Uh-huh.
B|How many stories? Just one?
A|Uh-huh, yeah.
B|I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but,
A|It's just one story. Yeah. It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
B|and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best friends
A|Uh-huh.
B|Yeah.
A|Oh, except the kid, huh, that's ,
B|And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much, and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
A|Sure. Yeah.
B|Really.
A|is that in term,
B|Most people are, are, retired or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever. So and I'm in my twenties, so I, I'm, I'm out more than they are, but they're at home at night,
A|Yeah.
