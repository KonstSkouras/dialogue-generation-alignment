B:	yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
A:	i just like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago um and it and that that's a interesting one. i i i like that because there's there are  i've noticed that every every major station now has their own law show. there's l a law and there's um equal justice some other one law and order or something. do you like the law shows or
B:	i mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma.

B:	but i think people try to on on t v i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote.
A:	my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult. was she in favor of it or or was she kind of opposed to it?
B:	and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
A:	uh-huh. i've heard an interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes an awful lot of money and commitment and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
B:	when they when they switch to switch
A:	oh.
B:	right.
A:	huh. well that's well that sounds interesting. matter of fact uh i guess you do uh you get a lot of graphics in there i imagine huh.
