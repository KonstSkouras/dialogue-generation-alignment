A:	it really makes an effort on to do this anymore.
B:	that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or
A:	right. right. uh-huh. especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like you know pro-life and and uh choice in in the special interest groups maybe um like amnesty.
B:	with baseball tickets.
A:	i know it i know it.
B:	right that's see that's what we did in girl scouts and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
A:	thirty or thirty-two for really good tickets. see they they sectioned it out even more. they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price. and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. and now they're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones. but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do.
B:	right.
A:	uh go ahead.
B:	and.
A:	and and they do group things. and then if health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in. it's really kind of difficult.
B:	i have some
A:	not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
B:	is it really?
A:	um. boy i like that.
B:	judge
A:	now i know a friend of mine who had a father uh she brought to her home uh to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out.
B:	surely  there's and end to the situation.
A:	okay there's one uh i meant living in texas where you at?
B:	i don't remember one from one station to another. i keep forgetting one station. what's your second favorite?
A:	that's interesting.
B:	really? huh oh yeah that's true hadn't thought about that. that is very inconvenient.
A:	and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala.
B:	yes.
A:	well that's good. well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that.
B:	did puppy go to?
A:	oh well anyway. uh we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
B:	that i mean that makes a big difference cause i wondered when they're taking classes with uh with people that are really are interested in the the subject and stuff like that.
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	the cat was here first so i know it's hard.
B:	oh are you? i don't care for that as much.

B:	and we all know one another and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.
A:	yeah.
B:	bye.
A:	actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt.
B:	oh really
A:	and he got to do it and so god just really blesses him in ways like that do trust god because i don't know kids are a blessing and and some people you know we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think oh well i'm not blessed i have an old car. but you've got five kids you know
B:	and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. it's like this train.

A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. yeah it is.
A:	and the extraordinary amounts i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
