A:	and were officially yeah and we're officially in a state of emergency. funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it. uh
B:	and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so i'm used to pieces and and i played classical flute i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that so. i i can relate to it i suppose but uh and i like i'm like you i like the older stuff too because i like chicago
A:	sure does. that's wonderful.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it is it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
B:	well i'm in graduate school now. i i i kind of feel like i wish i could have gone back to undergraduate now
A:	it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage.
B:	but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. you know just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them
A:	oh yeah yeah.
B:	it's like well i can't really give you a recipe uh
A:	and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh.
B:	yeah it really does.
A:	you have the seven day waiting period.
B:	i'd i'd have to say i haven't either.
A:	uh-huh. health food uh restaurants that
B:	but uh you think you'd buy uh an american car or a european or japanese?
A:	and so they went and tried out and my husband played harold hill from the music man and my son played one of the children in a band.
B:	so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year.
A:	do you?
B:	and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
A:	they are a handful.
B:	no i not that i'm aware of.
A:	i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses.
B:	well let me ask you this then.
A:	i said so do i i forgot about jazz
B:	and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
A:	it's the first and only time i've done that. we don't do anything exotic we just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that.
B:	well we've been here since sixty-six.
A:	yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one one extreme to another.
B:	my tax bracket is is pretty high up there. i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
A:	yeah. have you ever used do you use wordperfect ever? have you ever used wordperfect? or
B:	yes.
A:	well have we spent our at least five minutes?
B:	and uh i've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it
A:	i don't know unless it labor intensive or something. i really don't know.
B:	um i i i think we pay too much. and i've i look at my paycheck and i make well let's see. they take out in state and federal taxes
A:	i can believe that. well it's it's been interesting.
B:	or
A:	and how you're in  rome new york
B:	my husband is a physician so uh i i i talk to parents about this a lot. but children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order. and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like i do not know anything about this person. you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
B:	wow.
A:	huh.
B:	yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money.
A:	yeah.
B:	a electric car it's on demand. i mean it's either on or off.
A:	and as always it it seems a bit uh rushed. we do a lot of traveling around. we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
B:	um. wow.
A:	exactly. uh i'm not sure about pennsylvania whether we have it or not. for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often. i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh it's very difficult i know.
A:	.
B:	and uh i was up there last weekend and there are trees that that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead you know the the freeze just got them. they they weren't ready for it at all apparently and and we haven't had a typical fall at all. not much color you know changes have occurred at all. really weird this year. i'm not sure what that what that means.
A:	i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it
B:	and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
A:	okay. so we're in garland.
B:	uh no not actually
A:	but not all country. i don't like that when they start
B:	uh i guess i uh i like to play golf.
A:	did you?
B:	well she was almost ridiculous. like she'd eat ice cream and cookies. she'd
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	that's  yeah
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think maybe a year would be the longest.
A:	um the south hills area beaver county well originally beaver county .
B:	it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt. it was kept only by kings.
A:	and it's really a a blast. my wife hates it but that's the way life is i guess.
B:	so travel and leisure food and wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads.
A:	well it's really fun. um one of my neighbors moved here from memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
B:	because i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care.
A:	right. right. um i think i i've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad
