A:	well, that's not what i heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
B:	right.
A:	so what kind do you, uh, get?
B:	okay. yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
A:	yeah, i don't,
B:	yeah. and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
A:	so, that's why i do that.
B:	well good, well good. well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging? i tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, uh, club.
A:	oh i've i've been lots of places. my last vacation was actually in morocco i guess we, that one would count ,
B:	oh, that's great.
A:	oh, okay, my my dog, last german shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
B:	that, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
A:	well, i, i think we kind of are along the same lines.
B:	um.
A:	uh, i also take better homes and gardens.
B:	i mean, i guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here, but.
A:	which is, i think, what they also don't know. i mean that's, i think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
B:	i think it's great. i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else, and competition. i'm going oh, great, you know, it's a, it's a great role model for everybody.
A:	yeah, well that's, he's got a job there and this is his first year, so, it's been a real interesting thing for them
B:	i wish i could do something like that, but i can't, so
A:	they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
B:	is it a single story?
A:	um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. um, and the luxuries of a large car.
B:	uh-huh. right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up
A:	oh, gee.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
B:	and fortunately it was just like a retriever and then i've had a retriever.
A:	they just don't care.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you know, you just, you did not see, i did not see anybody in my classrooms, when i was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
B:	this isn't a good topic for me right now. i'm on a diet
A:	it's you know, um, but, uh, i don't, what else about housing except it's, uh, well, pittsburgh's housing economy, i think it's holding it's own.
B:	yes, uh-huh.
A:	but we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
B:	and if there's a game on, he's watching it. i mean, that's all there is to it,
A:	uh,
B:	yeah, but i'm not sure how successful that is.
A:	so was i.
B:	it had been, you know, of course, a farm.
A:	uh-huh. i have a girl and a boy, and the boy's five, he's in kindergarten, and the girl is four. she'll be in kindergarten next year. uh-huh.
B:	i don't know how much, and i had her for over two years and she was very affectionate. she would, you know, crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working, and things like that. yeah, much more than you would think.
A:	and they would not have the quality,
B:	and he's like glued at the t v.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	local you mean?
B:	and,  uh, somebody is on the premises
A:	yeah, he's like, i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about neal bush i think is his name.
B:	my boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy. and then we had a baby and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.
A:	one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and, she pushes the other one away from the food. apparently i don't know all the details but they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel and the other one is named holly.
B:	and you?
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well, then, um,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .
A:	huh?
B:	oh, uh-huh.
A:	and they're just really close here. and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
B:	uh-huh. absolutely. and that, i, i don't know if, uh, i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was prescribed for you but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin, well, penicillin's not on the list but, you know,
A:	and they sell, i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.
B:	that's amazing, well, what's the difference there, do you know?
A:	it's the same thing that's on the radio, word for word.
B:	but it served our needs. uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for. and that, and i'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac. i really would. it's not necessarily prestige,
A:	and, uh, evaluation of an individual. course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have. i think you have to dress sort of accordingly.
B:	but, uh mine was a year old,
A:	um, to don't, adam, talking to um city,
B:	i, i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing,
A:	it's really sad.
B:	i remember seeing that.
A:	yeah, and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in.
B:	oh duh, duh, duh you know,
A:	well.
B:	nothing.
A:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. seriously.
B:	which was real nice. i got married, uh, during the christmas season and we played, uh, old fashioned christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not, and it was real nice, i liked that a lot.
A:	yeah, that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early. is that right?
B:	right.
A:	yeah. i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and, and we've been in a state of emergency for over, you know, for ten or eleven days.
B:	you cannot show your retriever if it's, you know, a hundred plus pounds.
A:	oh.
B:	so, uh,
A:	probably. right, i can imagine that.
B:	oh.
A:	and we just have this, uh, really good time there. one thing is they don't have mosquitoes and, uh, sorry to say,  and, uh, in wisconsin we do, so, that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your, uh, you know, if, if you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs and, uh
B:	probably so,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death
A:	what do you like to watch on television ?
B:	i we live out in the country.
A:	uh-huh.
