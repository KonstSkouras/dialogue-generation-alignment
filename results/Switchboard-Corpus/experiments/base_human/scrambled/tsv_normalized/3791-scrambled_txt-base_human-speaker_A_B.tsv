B:	bye now.
A:	well it sounds like you you've got your hands full
B:	well now that is that uh that's related to the the aerobic uh 
A:	oh i agree. i think that people are getting off too easy. they're getting they're getting paroled too easily.
B:	but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
A:	and uh where are you from?
B:	uh-huh. what's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but  their training isn't what we need in this country.
A:	and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful.

A:	uh-huh.
B:	okay.
A:	oh yeah. okay.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents.
A:	no.
B:	but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery. somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries. you know.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	yeah. did uh did like did you go to disneyland?
A:	oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue?
B:	and um there's so many people who want a a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
A:	yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler
B:	uh i remember seeing that
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	and have you know like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like

A:	huh. yeah no they um the strawberries are coming in season now from  they're they're coming up from florida of course. i live in vermont so. but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from florida so.
B:	oh uh i was tested uh within my company. i think it's kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this
A:	the 
B:	no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.
A:	you know that's that's totally out.
B:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh absolutely. that's right.
A:	right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
B:	and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll and i'll actually get energy. and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great. that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim.
A:	see you next time. bye.
B:	uh i do too in fact
A:	oh yes i love my cats. i lost one one time uh
B:	they're in missouri and i could i i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they can't take the proper care of them. most of them.
A:	uh-huh. the taxes that people don't think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess.
B:	yeah.
A:	it's a little different uh challenge isn't it?

A:	have that. well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row. but there's not very many people that actually um. do get killed.
B:	so i don't know if we we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live. um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um
A:	yeah. uh-huh right. yeah. that would be neat sure.
B:	so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're they're uh trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess.
A:	i know where you mean. there is a mobil and all that kind of uh on that one corner that's about lookout there i think isn't it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	do you uh take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up?
B:	well i know up in connecticut the same thing happened people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
A:	and they're being put in the middle of the city
B:	oh really?
A:	i know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
B:	uh-huh. oh yeah they're always in florida. florida and louisiana i think and uh some of the  other southern states.
A:	huh. no.
B:	yeah but so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but
A:	wonderful. yes.
