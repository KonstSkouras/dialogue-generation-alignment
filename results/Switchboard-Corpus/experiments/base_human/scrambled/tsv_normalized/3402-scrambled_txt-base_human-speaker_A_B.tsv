A:	yeah. uh-huh. so as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
B:	yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse.
A:	no. yeah i think so. i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious. you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. yeah. yeah.
B:	really? huh. it really has been strange here this year i mean this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one.
A:	and so you know i do  have one friend who goes occasionally
B:	and and like you said pro pro-choice and whatnot.
A:	i i know but it it's it's uh easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me.
B:	yeah so do we.
A:	i don't know that it does. i i don't know that um if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out.
B:	but she seems to.
A:	you don't
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	okay wow
B:	i i i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
A:	but uh
B:	i don't know. you know some of the health insurance is written that way. you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it pre specified in the policy so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb  uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.
A:	right
B:	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
A:	and these kids um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
B:	yeah. right.
A:	oh they are. i love it it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities.
B:	oh okay.
A:	my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that.
B:	huh yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	right right.
A:	but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh into the air because he opened it
B:	and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family  and help them with the language.
A:	so. just don't mind me if i bounce back and forth.
B:	and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment.
A:	because everyone gains from it.
B:	wow. wow. that's a a big job.
A:	sure. yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh yeah you still have to do it. i i
B:	and that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges
