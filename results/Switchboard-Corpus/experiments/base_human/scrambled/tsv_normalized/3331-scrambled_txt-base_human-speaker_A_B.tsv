A:	okay.
B:	it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.
A:	i was going to say, that could be difficult
B:	um. paper just seems so innocuous.
A:	but then when i travel it is a little different situation.
B:	i used to, uh, live in the ozarks and, uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods.
A:	uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
B:	yeah. and it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know so much as, we just want to help people out.
A:	and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing. he's really caught on so that's really neat
B:	but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees, or new jersey.
A:	oh, no, i mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, do you know?
B:	right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
A:	but, um, i, my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.
B:	that's what she plans to do.
A:	our mothers used to use it. and then,
B:	and maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the united states.
A:	that's right. yeah, that's, that's true too. that's true too.
B:	because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment. so,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	they're always saying that somebody's going to, and some of them, i think unconsciously do it, you know,  as a just, you know, half
A:	that,
B:	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.
A:	yeah.
B:	oh, that's good, yeah.
A:	i, i think this is a little ridiculous.
B:	there's just too many people. uh-huh. that's right. not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.
A:	but we've got some this year.
B:	uh-huh
A:	well, i guess i'm, uh, more traditional in that i don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
B:	right, uh-huh. oh, yeah, yeah.
A:	yeah, uh-huh
B:	uh, yes. uh, we have two sons. uh, one's a freshman in college and one's a sophomore in high school.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
A:	yeah. as long as troy aikman doesn't get hurt again. that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year.
B:	yeah. yeah. they, they just run all over, the place, don't they,
A:	i mean it was amazing.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away.
B:	oh.
A:	you know what i'm saying? like,
B:	if you don't have a frost you'll be all right that's what i remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten, and you'd have to.
A:	but, maybe i'll try it one day. i'll get on there one day and see if i can, uh, um, what, what do they win, they, they win money i think, don't they?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well, uh, i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the, uh, jury system, do you?
B:	yeah. no, we've never had anything like that.
A:	i can do it on most any day of the week.
B:	um.
A:	okay. uh, do you own a p c by the way? i'm guessing you probably do.
B:	well, what did you do when you helped these people?
A:	oh, mercy.
