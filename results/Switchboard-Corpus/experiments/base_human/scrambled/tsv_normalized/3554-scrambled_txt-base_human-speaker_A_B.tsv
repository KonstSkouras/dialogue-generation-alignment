A:	yeah. what do you use it for?
B:	oh, okay. i don't think i really know that.
A:	right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
B:	and that's it. and we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it.
A:	uh, i used to do that a lot and then i like, um, we have a new child that will be a year old here next week, so i'll take a lot of pictures of her, you know, and spoil them,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	who makes that car?
B:	we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the i mean it's just, you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the summer.
A:	yeah, yeah.
B:	yeah, the, you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
A:	and i have not had to use the heat.
B:	yeah.
A:	yes. uh-huh. well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?
B:	so you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price. and i mean good, i would, let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. and probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and let's face it, what do they get paid.
A:	i liked the hills and the trees,
B:	yeah
A:	okay?
B:	uh-huh. yeah, my wife, uh, likes staying home.
A:	right, it's a little more understandable under the circumstances, i guess.
B:	now, i would like to see better dental insurance to me. was that our beep?
A:	uh-huh. and sometimes the, the help there does it, i think.
B:	and, and, and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think, you know, that, she doesn't think she could be a mother at home. that's not her bag. so she just doesn't think that she could, you know, the guilt feelings, she can't deal with with it anymore
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh, huh. do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger to society. it was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.
B:	i can't remember
A:	oh.
B:	okay.
A:	some did, uh, some did, you know, big brother, big sister, stuff like that. and i'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a, some sort of group. you know, activity like that.
B:	it just really gets way, when it gets way too hot
A:	uh, probably. uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
B:	its reliability. and, uh, i, you know, i've read all the consumer reports and things, and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars. if ford was a head and the shoulders above it, i'd buy a ford.
A:	oh yeah, i i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't, i can't take care of them as well because they're outside,
B:	right.
A:	so he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching
B:	well, uh, i, uh, yeah, i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty,  pretty rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted.
A:	yeah. well it's that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on america stands on is that they can do that uh, though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh you know but i i still what the flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh
B:	yeah, i like moody blues. i, i like mostly the older groups i think. oh, but we do have, i like simply red, we got simply red. i figure all our c ds that we have what i really like and, uh, i like breeze, i like the group. i think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, simply red. uh.
A:	well, i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons.
B:	uh, here it is. a t s computers.
A:	they're all real young, they're just raised right that's what god's told them to do but they're not condemning you, if you, we only have one child, you know, they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, i'm sure, for them to do that, you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it. and so i'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't do that at all.
B:	not at the same time.
A:	ready to talk?
B:	so, i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto, uh, reports
A:	uh-huh
B:	me, too.
A:	i know. i know. we're kind of the same way. you know, at first, you know, you, at first it was a real, it was a real hassle, and i'm wondering are we really going to do this, but you kind of get, i guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,
B:	plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it, and you got a great dinner.
A:	yeah.
B:	well, we're about a hundred miles from pittsburgh north.
A:	yeah.
B:	well, no, it wasn't forty-eight, it was, it was, uh, let's see, yeah, it was forty-eight. i was in the air force.
A:	whoops
B:	and so,
A:	right. well, i, i guess i just have not read i mean, usually, i just, if i find a good book, i will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. if it's that good,
B:	he's out of college and has a good job,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	in garland, right outside of dallas.
A:	and how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
B:	i'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids. uh and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know. when we, when i think about changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of health care they have
A:	right. yeah. uh huh.
B:	yeah, yeah. i think that it probably would be a, a good program. i think probably two years is too long.
A:	which that,
B:	no, they're.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. i'll bet they're involved. yeah.
A:	um, no, not right now.
B:	what kind,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so would i, i fortunately, i have never been in that circumstance, i hope i never am, like, like everybody else.
A:	yeah.
B:	that's right. absolutely.
A:	yeah, you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
B:	and, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	there's no question, i think that's really the best. if, if a woman is happy doing that,
A:	but, but, yeah, substantially, you know. um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
B:	yeah , mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick, and she said, i don't think he's sick, i think she's pregnant,
