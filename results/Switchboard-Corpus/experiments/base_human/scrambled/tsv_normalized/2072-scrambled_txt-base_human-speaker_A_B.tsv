A:	yeah, we've got a calico cat too.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah, i've done that once or twice. i didn't look at the clock when we started talking, so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.
A:	and, and you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.
B:	well, yes, of course, we do have capital punishment. and we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.
A:	and it, because, uh, we have it here at work as a matter if fact, at t i.
B:	we have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room and, uh,
A:	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
B:	so we're talking about second and third great children here.
A:	yeah, oh, yeah.
B:	i'd, i would agree, with that even more, i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended,  by the thought that i have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
A:	uh-huh almost cruel for him to, to walk.
B:	so, it was real nice.
A:	yeah.
B:	it's more rural,
A:	oh dear. oh but that's nice, you know, i mean the peach tree is, is a start and,
B:	yeah.
A:	so you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then.
B:	right, it requires a lot of effort to, to, to do that sort of thing.
A:	that's right. lessons are expensive though.
B:	do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off?
A:	right.
B:	yeah, yeah.
A:	well, that doesn't, i mean i ...
B:	well, i lived across the street almost from canada
A:	is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes , we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.
B:	okay. well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.
A:	uh
B:	oh, i wasn't there too long ago. uh.
A:	so, what do you think about a year or two of public service?
B:	no, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
A:	don't like to cook, huh?
B:	and, uh, we made that decision and, uh, so after she had the first baby, she stayed home. and, and we had a second baby and she's still at home
A:	you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v but you probably wouldn't.
B:	uh, well, yeah, i am as a matter of fact. well, actually i'm looking for another car, but, uh, uh, new, probably not.
A:	we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in central park.
B:	so that's not so bad, you know.
A:	it depends on who examines your eyes.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i would love that.
B:	right.
A:	i like it, uh, part of my problem is i have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
B:	get rid of them. exactly. i, i really, i, i think that that's the whole key here. this plea bargaining baloney, where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time,
A:	but i've, i've got some opinions on it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	um.
B:	there is a woman that, uh, made, well, she called herself a craft person so, i'm not quite sure what she made. and, uh, she made it. i mean there is no, your occupation has nothing to do with it.
A:	because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
B:	right.
A:	that will be neat, yeah. absolutely, they're expensive.
B:	yeah. that's right. our own hemisphere, but we've, that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.
A:	and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad.
B:	yeah, well, my, my oldest is only nine.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh lord.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, absolutely. yeah,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	do we pay too much?
A:	kind of scary when you think about that.
B:	sure, go ahead.
A:	actually it, ours is on at eleven it, it's, um, eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here in new york. um, i think they they do that, i think they put things on at, um, eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock, um, california time, like in california but in the middle they sort of, um, like central time or mountain time they, they push things back. so, i was actually, actually i'm not sure , i was in, i was in iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier, so, does your prime time start at seven o'clock?
B:	sure, same here.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big one for me.  uh, and i guess support for whatever, whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.
A:	all the, yeah. uh-huh. that's true.
B:	it would really, um, and i don't the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, i don't exactly recommend
A:	yeah, i think something like the peace corps is a bit harsh.
B:	i liked the sound of the harpsichord.
A:	well, i guess then, i will go, but i,
B:	uh-huh. yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. yeah, yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand, we went, wow
B:	um.
A:	especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty, yeah.
B:	uh, we had a, at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth. and, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, i would have liked to. i would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some t v watching.
A:	um, august, eighty-eight.
B:	is that right? oh, neat,
A:	well, they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that or,
B:	yeah, that would be even, yeah, i didn't even, think about that.
