A:	do you like to cook?
B:	we expected it to continue forever. i think they're doing pretty well this year though.
A:	yeah.
B:	good. there's nothing wrong with that. actually i think probably if i were going to get if i were going to be practical, which doesn't mean i would be,  i would prefer white. because, simply because it's more visible at night.
A:	oh, maybe my, dropping my phone. is that better?
B:	i really do. i think it'd be better that way and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because  they know that that there are problems
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	and like she's washing
A:	yeah.
B:	okay.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah, oh, the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying, are you getting rid of your cats, are you getting rid of your cats. you can't be pregnant and have cats. i'm like, uh, no, no, no.
A:	when was that on?
B:	oh. oh, that's nice, i, this is different for us because the other, in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks, and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees, and we do miss that. um, if we had a chance to move, i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as, as far as that goes.
A:	and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good.
B:	no, i don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not that familiar with them to know,
A:	hello, lynn.
B:	and you're in minneapolis,
A:	yeah. i've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. i think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, hewlett-packard did that for awhile. they went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. and, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but they do have socialized medicine and things like that.
A:	oh.
B:	my oldest is, uh, four and my youngest is about to turn three. two girls. and they are a handful
A:	yeah.
B:	last year it was d c, i guess baltimore caught them.
A:	really.
B:	wow.
A:	but i, i don't know the performance of it. that's a, ford product,
B:	and so i decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
A:	yeah
B:	and i do like them. and i'd like to have a compact disc player in the car. that would be,  something that i would really like.
A:	ooh, yes. and your kids all ski?
B:	yeah.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. you know, all these things. i mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
B:	but that's because it's so old.
A:	well i haven't had an awful lot of, uh, incidents regarding child care. when my two year old was in new orleans, she got bit on the cheek and, uh, but, uh, that's about the, the, uh, the extent of it. but, but, but when, i really am, am concerned about is that, uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, uh, uh, you know, investigation for, for, uh, you know, child molestation.
B:	really?
A:	yeah, that's a good idea.
B:	yeah, east texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester
A:	uh, they sure are just because, some innocent person, can really,
B:	oh, uh-huh.
A:	and no two of them are alike and
B:	right.
A:	oh, sure, because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
B:	yeah, what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers, this, you know, plus eighty to a hundred pound range.
A:	well, yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,
B:	that's great.
A:	oh, that's nice.
B:	um, most of the lawyer programs like, uh, law and order, they're not on the times that i've got, that i've watched because i haven't had t got, t v guide around here in ages.
A:	i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
B:	right. oh, it's tough i'm sure.
A:	next thing you know, you've got him.
B:	but what are you supposed to do with them. oh, okay.
A:	watch me.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	and i retired about five years ago and  started college.
B:	okay what kind of  foods would you have?
A:	right. uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry.
B:	if it rained we were stuck back in there. had a four wheel drive.
A:	so you're, you're not that far north then, okay.
B:	i know.
A:	right.
B:	well the german shepherd that i had before, we, we had a little pool,
A:	you hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
B:	but washington's a great place to do that.
A:	yes, yeah
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
A:	so i've got a pretty good grade there.
B:	that, i had heard that that was better. that was a better one.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. right, any ,  on the street, no, i know. uh-huh. yeah, and texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the, the i think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, i mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
B:	uh-huh. yes.
A:	forty-eight. that's a long time. uh.
B:	you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on, and, uh, it's, it's interesting.
A:	as a matter of fact, if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm, say in germany or france, uh, that, i'm automatically taken care of,
B:	yeah, i mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
A:	uh-huh. born and raised texan, huh.
B:	and i think that would be wonderful too.
A:	it's at, that was actually a big dilemma for me now because, um, cheers, cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time,
B:	i can't believe that i, i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for.
A:	did he, did he actually play in the pro bowl. i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go.
B:	yeah, i have a garden but you know, we have a garden.
A:	yeah.
B:	and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
A:	yeah, so, twin peaks, um, what happened was, i think, twin peaks, um, went, went off, they moved to a saturday night for a while. and then put, and then put something, i guess, gabriel's fire on it, and at thursday nights, and then they moved, um, no, gabriel's fire was on c b s, i think, i, i take that back. i'm not sure, but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when peaks was back in that time slot as well. so, i don't know.
B:	yeah, yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, what i'll do is, you know, like, i mean, you might have problems, but it's not your kids' problems you know,
A:	we have with aetna and, uh, i don't know if you're familiar with them but we're real happy with them.
B:	when he retired?
A:	wow
B:	that's a good idea.
A:	oh, i never heard of that.
B:	yes.
A:	at at, excuse me, at what age did you, oh, that's too bad because,
B:	um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.
A:	well, don't they take people who have some sort of, um, big abilities like and, and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones i saw they had, um, a man on who was, uh, he played college football and almost went pro, and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the, uh, she was in the junior olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very, very big sports backgrounds. to have they, leaned away from that sort of,
B:	but, oh, gosh, i can't even walk by central park yeah when summertime, just the smell is so bad of the horses.
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	well, i understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
A:	well, i think that's all i have to say.
B:	right. yeah.
A:	oh.
B:	uh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, that sounds lovely. uh-huh. oh, the wild flowers are beautiful. i think, um, i was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty. then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.
A:	yep.
B:	is it, is it, is it flooding anywhere?
A:	oh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah. yeah, i've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field. and so i've seen a variety of types of benefits. uh, i've worked for, for for awhile and they are, you know, a really academic type of place. and then i've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff. so i've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid and, you know, some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits and so, yeah, i would
A:	i know, i love mine too. well, it's been nice talking to you.
B:	yeah. yeah. i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.
A:	so, it's its' just different.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	no, the times i've been out deer hunting, i, i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
B:	she's out,
A:	yeah. it was a very interesting vacation. the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
B:	right, right.
A:	oh, my goodness.
B:	i mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it does. it really does and it has such a different sound to it, anyway. it's almost, i don't know the way it vibrates, it's kind of haunting, you know, on, on some of the notes it, it's, i, i like it.
A:	uh-huh. taxes.
B:	i don't either.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.
A:	no, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, i think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
B:	huh.
A:	my, uh, girlfriends do catering and they always, about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray. i think they try and suggest it.
B:	oh, boy.
A:	no, mashed potatoes.
B:	and the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so that, that sort of an, most of the teachers had degrees. uh,
A:	yeah, we, we've been married for two and a half years. we've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
