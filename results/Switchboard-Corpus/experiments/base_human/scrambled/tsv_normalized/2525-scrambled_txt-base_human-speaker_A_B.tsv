A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. i think some of, is how the, uh, you know, i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.
A:	exactly.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well, i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
B:	yeah, you can have it come on just early in the morning. and, and off by the, you know, by the time you're up and about.
A:	oh, yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well, i had never been there, that's pretty neat. my sisters both seem to like it pretty well. my brother-in-law works for the university, um, in dallas. he's admissions director. uh. university of texas in dallas.
B:	oh, that's not unusual, yeah.
A:	he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	that's probably true considering, yes. yes, uh, i guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,
B:	right. well, does your, the company say, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative.
A:	well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job, he has nothing, there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after.
B:	right, uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	that's incredible.
B:	i mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be, they can't, i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. i don't think the parole system is really helping that much
A:	i mean, i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. so, no, this was given to us by some friends.
B:	it is, it's a tough subject, it really is.
A:	some buildings do, it depends on the location. the area i live in right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all, no burglar alarms, no guards.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, that's too bad.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society.
B:	how long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
A:	yeah.
B:	okay.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right. right. that you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
A:	oh.
B:	you do not really feel that that really close to them.
A:	right, and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active.
B:	i saw that on hard copy
A:	no, i don't know that. but, i, i must say, that, um, when, when i did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.
B:	right
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you ready for that?
B:	uh-huh. did you go on the barrier did you see the great barrier reef and, and go snorkeling?
A:	and so i never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
B:	getting in, yeah.
A:	oh.
B:	and i've got a ten year old, and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms, and and he knows about aids,
A:	the story of my life
B:	right.
A:	course, and i like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
B:	basically.
A:	but, but, it was interesting to, i don't know if they're making them better or not, i, it's hard to say. some, i think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but i think the technology is better.
B:	exactly, yeah, um,
A:	i have a sister that used to live in sevren.
B:	an, it, an i feel bad for the policeman, because he's out there every day facing these people. this, this craziness, you know, people with, uh, automatic weapons and, uh, all this other stuff and trying to do a job
A:	and i felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, i think she loved that dog more than i did and, uh. she was really attached to it,
B:	you can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, cabbage patch answers and stuff.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	how did they end up this year? did they, did they make it to the play-offs at all?
B:	and i think they're better people because of it,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	to try to make them more effective and useful.
A:	mustang g t uh, can't afford it.
B:	so it's pretty minimal.
A:	they, they became, in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. and that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
B:	and i know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh,
A:	right.
B:	and, and the one person i know that has one, they, they feel guilty. she has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing, and so on, uh, on weekends she would, you know, spend all of her time with her kids and spend lots of, lots and lots of money. basically, i think they, they really spoil the child, to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings.
A:	yeah, they're, they're pretty good. they've got some good good, some good, uh, good players out there.
B:	it's always have to have it now.
A:	uh, and, uh,
B:	don't you want to be close to me? i mean, you know  be with other people.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so i get it from t v a lot. i get time i read time magazine um, that's one i read pretty regularly.
A:	i hope we're called up before too long.
B:	yeah, that's right, you know he was one of ours, one of our boys.
A:	yes.
B:	so she would just substitute once or twice a week, you know, just for that little extra money when we were in school. then we would just come home and just be, you know, go to a neighbor's house for an hour, then she'd be home. but she wouldn't do that every day.
A:	yes.
B:	heavy involvement from the public.
A:	i do too.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah but you have a rider.
B:	huh.
A:	you want to go first
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. yeah, i understand. we just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
B:	what about yourself?
A:	uh-huh. do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? will they make it through the summer sun?
B:	um.
A:	but, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.
B:	yeah, i don't understand  that, they, they don't want to be with anybody else.
A:	no.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, certainly.
A:	would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.
B:	and, and, and, uh, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in,  that it's an ingredient,
A:	it was, it was an interesting theory. she talked about the, uh, the catholics all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway, so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all, your, you don't have to come home, so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe, but when the protestant ethic happened in america, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became their version of the pilgrimage.
B:	uh-huh. well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive. they'll send out news bulletins. two or three times a year you'll get a news hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature, or guess who our local sheriff,
A:	but they're not that much fun, you know, you can't take them for a walk, you can't, you know, they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	so if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have nincompoops to, uh,
B:	i, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it
A:	so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
B:	it terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
A:	yeah, i know,
B:	uh-huh. i don't, i don't know that there is an easy solution, but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and i'm not sure what it would be. it would be money better spent than,
A:	right. that's
B:	so am i.
A:	oh, okay, we'll try to be real quick here.
B:	so it all comes filtering down to us all individually.
A:	oh, well, that's great.
B:	oh, okay. okay. do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
A:	okay. capital punishment, oh, i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion.
B:	yes, well, they were, they really wanted something teeny tiny, and i, uh, really wanted that retriever's disposition. uh, the ultimate to tolerant, trainable disposition,
A:	oh, really.
B:	and i, i really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.
A:	i've been in the house i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
B:	yeah.
A:	so you said you work, uh, in the gardens too. do you have, uh, a special flowers?
B:	um, i don't know who else i've ever. that's about it, i was always a viking fan. i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit and,
A:	yes, i've for the first time we planted them this year.
B:	but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry.
A:	uh,
B:	or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
A:	yes.
B:	no. no, no. nissan is japanese.
A:	i think so well, it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
B:	uh, actually my last vacation was in connecticut. uh, we went home to visit family. before that we were in hawaii.
A:	right, well, practical yes that's, uh-huh. right and it's cooler i believe, too, when you're driving in,
B:	and,
