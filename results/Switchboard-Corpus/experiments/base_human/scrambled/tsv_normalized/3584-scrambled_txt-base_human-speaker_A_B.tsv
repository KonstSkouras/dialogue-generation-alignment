A:	and so, but that somehow takes, organization. for me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, i can, i can do some of my reading,
B:	yeah, yeah. wow.
A:	is it called baldwin or bebble?
B:	and yeah, and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
A:	that's nice. we, um, we canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river.
B:	i'm trying to think. both, um, let's see they start, um, evening shade at seven and then it goes to, um, what is it after evening, um,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, who'd want to eat that stuff.
A:	uh-huh, i do, too, yep.
B:	and if it's, a loving environment, i think it's very good and, and that's really what we've learned about it. she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
A:	so that's the only reason that we kept that, we debated for a long time plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know, like ...
B:	okay uh, at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you would be looking for?
A:	no.
B:	but then, i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
A:	and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and, uh, and adjusted,  where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,
B:	exactly. right.
A:	but i'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
B:	to her go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy i unplugged it for you. but you don't need to drag it down the hall
A:	but it was,
B:	the, at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that. of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. not a fun thing to try to recover from.
A:	okay. and so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. and, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
B:	yeah.
A:	but it, this is her first credit card thing, well, when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal. look at this they sent me this money, you know. so then when i explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff , of course, she tore it up. but a lot of parents would not take the time, you know, and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are, and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it, they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something. you know, somebody sent them something free.
B:	well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
A:	well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes, of course you're going to lose some that way
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. t i got, uh, a lot of advances in it really. uh, hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us. we sure need, uh, the business. okay, current events. uh, you, you've got the question you can go first there, since i called.
B:	for instance, uh, i saw a thing on, uh, nova, i think it was the other day.
A:	oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other, you know, trade magazines, and, uh, uh, such as that, uh, where i might read the, the occasional social and even current event commentaries, and, and everything as diverse as a c m to, uh, uh, some of the, uh, some of the other tabloids i get. so, uh, i guess i use about eighty percent written, is probably my input and twenty percent, uh, television. i, i think i respect the, from a journalistic perspective current events.
A:	oh, that's great.
B:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, my home is, well, is typical for the area. i live in a development, uh, it's a relatively, i would say, well, god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging
A:	yeah. yeah. i mean, i don't, i honestly don't really think i could have, you know, done much better than i did in the school system i was in. mean
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	is it, yeah, i used to take that. right.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and that i was when i was a baby but so, morocco i think would be wonderful because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world i think would be great.
A:	so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would.
B:	really was.
A:	oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a.
B:	yeah. wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for, if we approve it?
A:	right.
B:	but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, i think that, uh, that they should.
A:	right.
B:	okay. and you put up, set up the track, pylons. okay.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides
A:	okay, what kind of house do you live in?
B:	but i don't know much about camping in texas.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. i was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. and so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
A:	okay. so, uh, mike, what are your opinions on, uh, trial by jury?
B:	well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?
A:	bye-bye.
B:	where do you live?
A:	yeah, okay, well back to crime, i guess we're supposed to talk about that. they say what aspect are you worried about, well, i think at this point, i for one am worried about every aspect
B:	i do.
A:	well, i used to make the regular pudding, the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day, where you cut the pie, it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red, and i'm like, oh, this is kind of groedy .
B:	you know,
A:	i went, well i did work, um, just very for some time but i didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a difference.
B:	uh, you know, i mean it was ready for the graveyard.
A:	yeah, seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit, and i don't think they ever care to.
B:	um, yeah.
A:	yep.
B:	yeah, she just appeared.
A:	yep.
B:	yeah,
A:	um, you know, i'm not sure, i'm not positive, i didn't, i didn't really think about that. i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper. but, not that i'll ever go. i hadn't been to a cowboys game, time, last time i went to the cowboys game was during that, um, n f l strike, or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there, and it was the, uh, dallas and washington redskins game. and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets, because a lot of those doctors have season tickets, and they, um, if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else. so my dad, i went with my dad to a game that one time. but that wasn't a real, you know, it was, it was the scab teams, it was kind of, you know, it was kind of different, i guess. and before that it's been quite a few years. i've been wanting to go to a game, i just never, never have gotten around to it. so maybe this year .
B:	right, right. yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...
A:	what next?
B:	uh, we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began. uh, we almost live and, and breathed it for, because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done.
A:	yes
B:	and it isn't because of the, well, there has been a lot of speculative building. uh, i don't know, perhaps not in dallas,
A:	well, i just,
B:	oh, on one hand i see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
A:	right. are you married?
B:	i remember food
A:	you know, you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever. and i know that, that the southeast asians, the hmong people that i've done some work with, uh, feel very quite hurt and, and unsure of themselves when here. because they're coming from, you know, from the slash and burn intercultural society, you know, they're coming from the middle ages, basically. and they're being plunked down, plunked down into america. many of them had been promised by the c i a, during the war over there, that because they co-operated with the c i a, and they helped the c i a out, that when they came here, the c i a would help establish them in america, and the c i a, of course, isn't doing that.
B:	well, the times were different too.
A:	well, that's it. last year, i think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in january, and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it, and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until i think it was may or something
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,
B:	and it came on t v the other night and i was watching it again, and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
A:	they're not going to recruit me anymore, i'm through. no more for me.
B:	yes.
A:	i know but he's a man come on, men know how to do that, right?
B:	oh really do they, don't do any damage, though, they just fly right back out, if you have the,
A:	so, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
B:	yeah.
A:	and they're into sports
B:	is that right?
A:	but, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids *listen: this and utt2 as one utt are the they are so good. i'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and, that, that's what they're called to do.
B:	it was gorgeous. it was just gorgeous. i mean just gorgeous. um, and they both, you know, both the half breed and the pure breed had the, uh, what i consider the, the, the perfect disposition. but you know what, you know what scares me about golden retrievers? since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders. which is probably where yours came from. people that don't know what they're doing, and they breed them, you know, for a certain characteristic. and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big, for somehow big is perceived as the better. and when you start doing that you really tamper with, you know, the, all the, the years of, uh, culling litters and, and, uh, you tamper with what the dog innately is.
A:	okay
B:	oh, super.
A:	sure.
B:	all for a thousand dollars?
