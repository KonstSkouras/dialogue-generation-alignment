A:	and, you know, various other things, raised it up.
B:	i have not gone back lately. in fact, uh, this past sunday was the, was the reunion, but i did not get to go. uh, i have,
A:	oh.
B:	so,
A:	and it started raining and i was hysterical. i was, i was, i mean, you would have thought a child had died.
B:	take a twenty-two and go out.
A:	yeah.
B:	it was so funny to see, it was a really cute little kid too.
A:	and he was the last one she carried across, you know, the whole big sad story.
B:	uh-huh. i do too,
A:	and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home
B:	and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, but, it, it's mostly relaxing and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or, but, uh,
A:	oh, okay, yeah, i got my brother and my whole family there. i'm, i'm talking to you from dallas right now.
B:	we have just had that law, i think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in texas
A:	well how many rooms do you think, yeah?
B:	huh.
A:	i don't think i would like that. what kind?
B:	uh-huh. you must be a .
A:	and, uh, i can't really talk too much about the problems with, uh, public education in detail because the school system i went to was, uh, really superb even though it was a public school  system.
B:	uh, usually either black or red.
A:	um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know. um, we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
B:	right. besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this ...
A:	well, my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet.
B:	but everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day-care and, and leave them and, i don't know, i just don't want, i just don't want strangers raising my children.
A:	oh, yeah. i bet that's a pretty nice setup.
B:	and, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. i think they could, uh, save money by not doing that. you know, every time, say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.
A:	i call on oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie. so it depends.
B:	no, huh-uh.
A:	any mass murderer type individual.
B:	yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
A:	and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around, i think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down. i don't know what channel he found that on
B:	yeah, you too, you too.
A:	oh, of course. it's, it's political maneuvering. the, the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang everyone, and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic. they're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror. *whose who's neither side wants that. they want to find a juror that's going to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
B:	well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
A:	i think so too, uh, i know the, the group i was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, boy, they just really, you know let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently
B:	and,
A:	i, i don't either. it's a really delicate, uh, moral, issue. because, if you have, well, i guess the one thing i do see that is, is that needs to be a solution is, that if you do let people into the country, i do feel you have a certain obligation to,  to get them on their feet.
B:	but,
A:	okay.
B:	uh
A:	however, i'm sure they're there.
