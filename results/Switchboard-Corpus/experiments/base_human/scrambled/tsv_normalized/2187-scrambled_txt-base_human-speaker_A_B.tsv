A:	yeah, that's pretty out there. what, well,
B:	i, i, i grew up on a farm, uh, in iowa, and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. and then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me and i, i helped out with it. but, uh, although i have brought my boys into to see where i work, it's not that easy, and it's, it's certainly not at all common, and they, they just don't really have that same idea,
A:	oh, he was found guilty, yeah.
B:	for east texas or something?
A:	so, what are your thoughts on dining out?
B:	like you don't have any money to, to, get out.
A:	yeah so,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	no, it's not realistic.
A:	i is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?
B:	that's all i got to say for it.
A:	but it's pretty congested. we are considered in the country,
B:	they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
A:	okay.
B:	he actually died a few months after that, and so as, at least in retrospect, it was the right thing to do because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days.
A:	so often i think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad. i work with a lot of elderly people, i'm a trust officer
B:	yeah.
A:	no. yeah. there was a, t i has got this organization called t a d which is t i'ers against drugs. and, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know, and that's, they use the money from that to fund this t i'ers against drugs program. it's, you know, t i doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that. and they had talked about having a thing like, one saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
B:	oh, i bet.
A:	and i was by myself in china too.
B:	just, pick up and head on out.
A:	well, yeah, they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
B:	people aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it, they just put it on a charge card, put it on account, and then pay off the bill because they want it now.
A:	and we would have to, we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and, that's a good family place to go,
B:	the the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
A:	because i know they do frequently, i mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
B:	i've, i've never i've never even been called to jury duty.
A:	nice talking to you. bye-bye
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and then i found out that my new phone wasn't working right.
B:	so that's make up most of the laboratory so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.
A:	well, i don't blame you for that.
B:	i, you know, i'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know, this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	we'll see you, bye-bye.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right.
B:	especially if they're found guilty of the crime.
A:	oh, yeah, they have, uh, uh, what i, what i used to, uh, now that i don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
B:	well, yeah, i think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff. in durham, which is right next to raleigh.
A:	yeah, yeah, i can see it'll be a good break.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	a, a bedroom for my mother, and, uh,
B:	to put her in a rest home?
A:	so she didn't have to be transported back and forth. so, she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well. it's not her favorite place to be in. she'd much rather be here with me. but when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her,
B:	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	yes.
A:	huh.
B:	yeah,
A:	so,
B:	we just have the case, i'm, i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry.
A:	i know, if somebody doesn't do something. uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait x number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?
B:	i've been to telluride which is on the west side and, uh, copper,
A:	right, but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.
B:	yeah, i know, and that's, that's what happened to my brother. he came to school up here, and then when he went down there, he was just so bad off, you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain.
A:	i know it, i know it.
B:	uh, work, uh, i'm a contract programmer.
A:	yeah.
B:	yep.
A:	um.
B:	uh.
A:	especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, uh, not, uh, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
B:	but, then, what do i know, i don't have any kids. no, none at all
A:	oh, my.
B:	right. yeah, i'm not into watching sports. now my husband likes to watch football, he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much, but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes to watch college on saturday, and then of course cowboys on sunday.
A:	uh-huh. well you kind of know what it's like, then. yeah.
B:	and, uh, she, she got pregnant and then we decided she would stay home with the kids. we would make that sacrifice. it is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one.
A:	well both of mine are boys. they're eight and eleven
B:	so, i, i would have really, i haven't really priced, you know, in the market, so i,
A:	okay, so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	a t s?
B:	um
A:	in santa barbara.
B:	it is just a real pain, or, you know, if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.
A:	that is when she did, i think.
B:	yeah
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room  and, and eat some good meals.
A:	would be, would, might be really useful. uh, and if it's, you know, uh, just people helping people i think makes, makes the community so much happier.
B:	in that case, maybe, you know.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	until you pull the pin, yeah.
A:	well, i'm, are you there?
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	oh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, i always said if i well, i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog
A:	except i think the cowboys are on the upswing i don't know about the vikings
B:	yeah, that's true.
A:	no.
B:	yeah, it is. it really is.
A:	yeah, we, we did, for a time.
B:	rome, new york, it's up state it it's, uh, near syracuse
A:	right.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah, you know, if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better, but if you get a sour strawberry,
B:	it's just, it's just ridiculous.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, yeah, i think so
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we just thought it was absolute heaven.
A:	and we have to bring the paper bags back every time. because they won't take them.
B:	uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
A:	okay, well thanks for your time. i enjoyed talking to you.
