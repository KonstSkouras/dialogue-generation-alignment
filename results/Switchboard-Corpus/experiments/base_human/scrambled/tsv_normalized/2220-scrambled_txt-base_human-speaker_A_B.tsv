A:	oh so you've heard the richardson symphony?
B:	it really does the job. but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. and if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then it's burned up you know.
