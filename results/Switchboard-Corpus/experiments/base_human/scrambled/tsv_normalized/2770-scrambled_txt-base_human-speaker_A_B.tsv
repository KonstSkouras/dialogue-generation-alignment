A:	it's that's no problem here. yeah we really liked it up there but then
B:	if it's a company you know that they're insured. unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages

A:	we found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes. they just don't have them and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear
B:	i have one and i can not remember the name of it uh it is supposed to be a mystery.
A:	oh yeah he did he did. it was it was really a shame.
B:	you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around t i. like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what i've heard

B:	so if it's your peers and you're not educated then
A:	and i think um in fact if i had to do it all again i you know after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back.
B:	let them do it.
A:	right exactly. i was a i was a boy scout. as part of being a boy scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an eagle scout you have to spend a do a yearlong project.
B:	i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i don't think much of of life imprisonment. first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother. just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
B:	and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
