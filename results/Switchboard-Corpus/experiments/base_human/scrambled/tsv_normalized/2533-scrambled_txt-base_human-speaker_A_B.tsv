A:	my wife had uh just put in a bunch of i want to say they are pansies.
B:	i see.
A:	uh just like a uh set up a lot of times and it's like really large uh parking lots. and pylons and things.
B:	and uh yeah.
A:	yeah they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them usually.
B:	bye.
A:	there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that.
B:	i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books.
A:	well i i
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah they're going to get better. i mean you know.
B:	oh yeah. put them in salad yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but uh do you ever watch cheers?
A:	right.
B:	and i also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure uh it has the features in it that i want.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard? that's true.
A:	she's i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	i haven't been on vacation in a while either. um usually when we go we go to colorado to estes park area. which is up kind of near denver. and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the texas heat that kind of thing.
B:	um.
A:	uh
B:	and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes so. but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know that are more you know nonessential items.
A:	well i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean he didn't get to see much action. but too bad. because now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one's going to have much faith in him any more.
B:	so i called four or five dog trainers because i don't like the little dogs.
A:	because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less
B:	yeah fluid resistance.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it's incentive  speaking of bush we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of bush they that had a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff.
A:	but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
B:	uh-huh. bye-bye.
A:	tight turns hard acceleration. i've seen a lot of mustangs uh compete and it's interesting. they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class.
B:	it it it's pretty bad here too.
A:	you know. uh-huh.
B:	that's what i've heard.
A:	right.
B:	well my home at the moment is an apartment.
A:	you know.
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them.
A:	uh-huh. it sure is. the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences. they were using it as eating out uh when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
B:	quicker  maybe yeah.
A:	yes.
B:	uh what do you think?
A:	in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback. i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of. but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh aikman's back in practicing doing real real well. um who is it michael irvin
B:	so i do love classical music or it or or uh contemporary classical.
A:	oh god.
B:	and why can't you why can't the f d a say you know if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them
A:	and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good. and then about a half a cup of sugar and i let it pretty much i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in. and it's the the trick is is to have this blender so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes seven to ten minutes
B:	well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a an escapement type thing. i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure
A:	wow.
B:	what are they going up to thirty bucks or something?
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh. right because they're a danger to everybody else. huh that's interesting. i have to uh agree with that.
B:	so at one point i had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house.
A:	but the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike. i think it's pretty much typical for this area.
B:	but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that
A:	oh no no no no.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah in certain crimes.
B:	uh both
A:	i kind of uh stopped listening after a while.
B:	is that so? i didn't know that.
A:	the i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean i'm learning and stuff because  i'm at you know in school.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	yes. yes.
A:	i have xanadu and precious and rascal.
B:	oh it's it is. i mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.
A:	so uh that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in arlington when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
B:	uh-huh. okay. well ...
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh i don't like nineties.
A:	right.
B:	yeah well that makes a really big difference. but but still it's just as hard as having that
A:	but it is nice to have it because there's uh with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
B:	now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
A:	i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the the mowing.
B:	not too much. what kind of what kind of things do you write?
A:	forgot about that.
B:	okay.
A:	huh-uh. well i'm in pennsylvania.
B:	yeah the first first couple of times it's pretty scary but uh after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too.
A:	have you have have you seen this often?
B:	right.
A:	and they were very helpful
B:	uh-huh.
A:	instead of being carried
B:	uh do you know where uh custer is?
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah. i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like october
A:	well it can get expensive
B:	yeah.
A:	well good to hear. i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania.
B:	lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh plano community orchestra. uh just you know different backgrounds. it's been really kind of interesting.
A:	okay. i'm sure that i probably uh prescribe to different magazines ones that you do
B:	yeah it when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.
A:	real excited when i heard this. so far i've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football i love this.
B:	so uh
A:	nursing homes.
B:	yeah yeah
A:	and it's probably because i i i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then i've been abroad a lot
B:	yeah.
A:	oh yeah yeah we do we call that doing biscuits
B:	yeah.

A:	because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
B:	yeah see that's the same thing here.
A:	it's uh you know getting ready and taking care of everything. but it's um it's really refreshing. so
B:	yeah. sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of .
A:	yes
B:	yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them.
A:	well it doesn't make sense. because if they want people to convert you know. they should make it worthwhile.
B:	well for some things.
