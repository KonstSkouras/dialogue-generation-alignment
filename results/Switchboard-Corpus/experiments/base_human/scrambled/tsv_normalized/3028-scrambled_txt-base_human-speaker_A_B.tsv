B:	okay uh.
A:	i know two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight uh because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
B:	but uh we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace. i don't know what it's like around uh hattiesburg.

B:	and she's so easy going and so sociable

A:	do you ever watch that?
B:	yeah. right and especially if you have a family.
A:	yes. yes and sometimes now we're getting that uh the other football where they play it inside and you know this is a you know this is too much saturdays and sunday this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know all of that
B:	and uh then after that i my sister lives in turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to turkey.
A:	and it was just uh amazing to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out  and being rearrested an.
B:	physics.
A:	and that went over real well

B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	i don't know what it's like now i haven't been back up there in awhile.
A:	i know i do too i most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like you know that's really why god and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't i had my tubes tied so you
B:	yeah but at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far i couldn't do it.
A:	and there are times i think gee i should give my kids
B:	yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's it's just hysterical.
A:	true.
B:	you're still trying to dry out?
A:	uh-huh.

B:	i thought that was on the upswing again now.
A:	okay.
B:	yeah i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean  because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that
A:	and i'm kind of like yeah. i shall they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know. that was going to use it for good so
B:	mine's broke at the moment but
A:	but yes we're into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. we even have peewee basketball here. so there's always something.
B:	right.
A:	oh yeah yeah.
B:	oh yeah.
A:	yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person. and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know uh kidnapping um you know when they i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh uh fine and penalty associated with it
B:	yes uh-huh that's it
A:	right.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. so they're pretty good kids huh?
B:	would you then go hiking. i mean would the camping be part of a long hike?
A:	that's right. i'm i'm kind of bad about that.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	my problem is i don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
B:	i don't know.
A:	uh i believe in it too
B:	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know. what ever however much effort you feel like putting into it.
A:	really? i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but um i understand a little bit about the texas rangers. i know george bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground and that um yeah  i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system and uh the radio's kind of cruel i mean think the he this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground i mean how humiliating for a man to do that any man. i don't care if you're president.
B:	um actually i have um i've i've been in them but um just visiting and uh we used to when we were like in in our teen ages we'd go on sundays and visit you know the older people. but um i have an elderly grandma that lives with us.

B:	i guess that's how it gets passed on. you know when one person you hear  from another person
A:	huh.
B:	statistically that's true.
A:	they they're caught dead to rights. i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life.
