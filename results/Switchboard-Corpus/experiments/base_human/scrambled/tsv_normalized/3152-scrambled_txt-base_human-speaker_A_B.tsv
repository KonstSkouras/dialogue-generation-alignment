A:	yeah right right. yeah well i i only you know subscribe to the things i'm interested in. i used to be into coin collecting so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know. i used to get that. so now that i'm into dolls that's about all i really really want you know.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah keep it there
B:	well i think that should be likewise decided by the jury you know because i don't know i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for any reason
A:	bye-bye.
B:	tibby and liberty.
A:	oh. uh i had i had a dog one time and uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed
B:	and this is before i was born.
A:	yeah.
B:	yes.
A:	we would no longer need paper at all.
B:	oh good.
A:	yeah they they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they about eight months ago they gave it to us.
B:	you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
A:	i like it.
B:	some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like i'm not eating in there are you nuts? and uh we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
A:	well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it?
B:	oh. oh that's neat.
A:	yeah yeah she's the she's the nice one. we uh we used to live in an apartment and like our cats never went outside but um the neighbors used to let their dogs out and our neighbors were i don't know kind of slimy and uh our cats wound up getting fleas uh from the apartment that we were in
B:	so we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
A:	right now both of us are students.
B:	but uh yeah
A:	probably so. yeah you can get a head start on it. like ice in
B:	oh yeah.
A:	you get some pollutants such as those but those are natural
B:	yeah well i i do uh you know craft work and sell stuff at shows and that and uh uh you know it's it's it's a real eye-opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know.
A:	uh premeditated murder. crimes of that nature i think should definitely
B:	but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
A:	huh? okay.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i like the moody blues. did you like them?
B:	i grow a lot of things a lot of food.
A:	so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
B:	i see.
A:	minneapolis area
B:	they they do.
A:	uh now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze. which is probably closest to gold that you can get
B:	uh our our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year.
A:	well that's really yeah that's i bet that was nice.
B:	so
A:	i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from.
B:	uh
A:	gosh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	than we think. sure. sure.
B:	so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty so
A:	oh uh-huh. yeah.
B:	and it was difficult to hold them together. and then of course he died two years ago so you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
A:	are you ready?
B:	i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
A:	and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
B:	they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. i guess that's what retirement is all about.
A:	and the one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesn't seem like.
B:	well i mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania. it's because i'm sorry the commonwealth of pennsylvania.
A:	and that was even harder for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
B:	right.
A:	yeah. but it's i i know.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh yeah yeah yeah.
B:	i know there's you know when you adjust your income for what you put out for day-care you know you're only making like five.
A:	so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state?
B:	yeah.
A:	but also most places like big star does and i'm not sure if kroger does or not but
B:	yeah yeah.
A:	oh okay.
B:	i that true yeah. yeah she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him.
A:	yeah.
B:	oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time.
A:	yeah you know it makes sense um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know makes good t v movies and that's about it.
B:	right. well do you think that should be implemented in the work place. you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	and uh it was nice talking to you.
B:	it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
A:	and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing. i sort of watch their technique too and and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning.
B:	uh i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh
A:	okay.
B:	uh yes i am. i'm working in the computer science department here uh at c m u.
A:	yeah.
B:	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
A:	yeah
B:	well another reason well i guess i can't say that it i don't like the rain completely. we have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden
A:	well i don't either unless it's like uh some of my favorite's like a friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go and it's sleeping time. but if you have to get up and get out in it i don't like it either
B:	it was real hilly.
A:	uh. explained  *listen; could be br
B:	but uh
A:	normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it.
B:	well it really isn't too big yet. we we a lot of people say that but um it's
A:	she's ninety-two.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	oh yeah yeah.
B:	i think that helps.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	that's my understanding of the way uh the way it works. usually the the person ordering doesn't pay. but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. and there there are some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that.
B:	right.
A:	really? have you served on a jury?
B:	uh cause that makes a big difference. my wife works part-time.
A:	yeah.
B:	oh yes they're both running around now.
A:	really?
B:	and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
A:	well church softball leagues so
B:	yeah.
A:	these some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
B:	um personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified. on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work.
A:	and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that's going up today
B:	uh a lot of i guess is.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh.
