A:	so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home, and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility. she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
B:	i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so, i really don't have anything to compare it to.
A:	yeah. i think it would also help them if they then went on to college. i know that my first couple of years of college were, um, uh, probably too carefree at the, beginning
B:	that's great.
A:	oh, i imagine.
B:	i didn't ,
A:	you know, uh, something light and easy. if it was pretty informal about anything.
B:	and i do get tired of that but, uh, i don't know, i don't think i'd want to change it.
A:	it's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
B:	yeah.
A:	yes, it is.
B:	but how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first baby, almost any day uh-huh.
A:	oh, wow.
B:	is talking to someone in sorry.
A:	oh, i'm sure it would.
B:	uh, uh, i don't think anybody would ever argue that. or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday
A:	so many, uh, women are heads of state and i, you know, we, we keep saying oh yes, we feel some day a woman will be president. but, uh, i have some question, whether or not they will ever really get around to that. i think we'll have a black president before we have a women president.
B:	right, right.
A:	oh, they help you.
B:	i think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	uh, sports car.
A:	an eel?
B:	oh, okay. well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. that's why i was just
A:	so,
B:	huh-uh.
A:	um.
B:	oh. right. over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to. but, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off. that's what i do. uh, and i, i recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.
A:	yeah. sure, well, texas,  used to be part of mexico, or most of it
B:	and, uh, they're going to the big cities. it makes it very difficult.
A:	oh yes,
B:	yeah. well i lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time.
A:	so, not, i, i mean, i'm, the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury, but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be,  things like that.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. corrode. huh.
B:	anyway i have another, uh, recycling method i use.
A:	yes.
B:	um.
A:	with the company than,  than having to go, that's , that's right. yes, i, agree with that.
B:	yeah, it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, but, uh, i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, and, uh.
A:	yeah. mine was two in december
B:	no. no, not at all.
A:	no, it's not even that.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need. and, uh, it's staggering.
B:	and this, eventually things just went too far
A:	bye.
B:	some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless. this may seem to be the best way out. i don't know.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	scientific.
