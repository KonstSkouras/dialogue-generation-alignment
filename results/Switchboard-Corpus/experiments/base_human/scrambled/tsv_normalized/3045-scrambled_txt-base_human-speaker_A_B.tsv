A:	yeah.
B:	now i am i am adamantly against that.
A:	not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,
B:	yeah, he's not that far, he was sort of in between strasbourg, and paris.
A:	and he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.
B:	but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish.
A:	right.
B:	yeah, that's how it works.
A:	but here again i dress casual quite a bit so,
B:	oh
A:	well,  how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	but, um, you know, i don't, i'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if i don't, if i don't, uh, see any results of it the next day.
A:	uh-huh. oh, okay, well, they seem to be on later,
B:	to okay. and i don't know what the solution is.
A:	yes. yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right, and if they're overcrowded, well, you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place.
B:	i think in the next session they they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh florida.
A:	i have two.
B:	but, uh, i, uh, yeah, for one thing. uh, but yeah, we, uh, we do but our two had, had, uh, totally different interests of, but there was not much, uh, overlap as such. the, the older one is not, was not at all into, uh, sports for the most part. uh, he participated band and, and, uh, scouts were his two big things.
A:	that and sleeping late
B:	oh gosh.
A:	but i did a walk last night, and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right.
B:	did you, did you sue him under the civil system?
A:	i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework.
B:	i mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.
A:	and then i want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and i want an air bag and, uh, i guess,
B:	uh, i think i'd like to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, i mean, a, a acura legend. uh
A:	but i know they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. you know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to, if you want to finish,
B:	uh-huh. right.
A:	they don't go and see them. that's right.
B:	well, we've tried having, let me turn the t v off, we've tried having a vegetable garden, and i'm from chicago, and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from chicago. and we have tried several years in a row, and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer, and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
A:	all right.
B:	but it, it's interesting, listening to them. i think, i think the social changes in them, i think i see it more with that generation than i do with like our generation.
A:	i bet
B:	well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,
A:	right. well, we just moved down here. we used to live up in seattle for a couple of years.
B:	right, and that becomes difficult then.
A:	right.
B:	on your friends, that's true, that's true. well, we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with, we both have older cars and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars, you know, on the car in two months or something,
A:	so.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but, uh, i don't know if, you know, the, it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. there, there's still a big question in my mind that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing, is something that still bothers me.
A:	just her whole house is like wow.
B:	but, you know, our, like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not
A:	uh-huh, right. i think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.
B:	and they plan the reunions, the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer. uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.
A:	uh, i would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
B:	not getting to go.
A:	i think it was just rare, i really do.
B:	wow, that's great.
A:	it stays nice and fresh.
B:	you've got to see it. especially since you have a german, it is so cute.
A:	yes.
B:	oh. huh.
A:	i mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.
B:	little, little oak tree that was dead, and cut it up and split it .
A:	yeah.
B:	okay. yes, i do
A:	so, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.
B:	i mean, you know, i remember, well, just the things that are covered. i remember watching the world series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen
A:	and i just really, really liked the way he writes. it's just, incredible.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing and when they were young.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right. yeah.
B:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but i mean it doesn't give you trouble?
A:	and so she asks the same questions over and over again. which is not you know, unrealistic.
B:	i keep forgetting, what, what she named him.
A:	yeah.
B:	well, not so much personally but my, um, husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother, i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such. they live down in college station where, his parents do too. and they put her in a home last year.
A:	but very true to life, i mean, i've seen our family in several of those situations
B:	oh.
A:	i've heard all these stories about, i travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in europe every year,
B:	right. some people, i mean, families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. it would be handy.
B:	yes
A:	right, and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, they just can't do it.
B:	"yeah, that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids, we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're *listen; ""because"" may start new utt unit  you know, something"
A:	so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together. so that's all the family, so planning our family reunion was very easy you know .
B:	uh-huh, yeah.
A:	no how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in i guess about october and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, i or, i humane society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
B:	yeah, well, don't even talk to me, i, when i was single i had gone away for the weekend,
A:	they really do. yeah.
B:	so i guess i can't really i can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region
A:	i'm glad my husband's not like that.
B:	but, they would have to be supported in some way, and i'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
A:	yeah, exactly.
B:	yeah. oh, i see what you're saying.
A:	so. yeah, it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot. i mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
B:	yeah. i figured for and they've just raised the, um, income caps on social security to the point where you have to be pretty, you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well.
A:	uh-huh. it was amazing i went to the far east, uh, back in october to do some training for t i and i,
B:	that if the, the laws, and, and were, were harsher and were enforced,
A:	all righty . uh, i'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today.
B:	well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
A:	anyway, do you have a pet?
B:	but they, they're already, uh, have three strikes against them when they're out there.
A:	yeah. but they're not doing bad. people are pretty surprised that they, i mean they beat the giants.
B:	and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging. my husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family. his family was very scattered and very diverse.
A:	where are you?
B:	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect, and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main assistant back, uh, in the fifties and well, i guess, in the sixties, up until his death.
A:	but it seems like here, i would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
B:	so, i don't do that anymore. and the, the recycling at georgia tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
A:	but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder, i'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for. you know,
B:	they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
A:	so. so, if we get what we what we deserve
