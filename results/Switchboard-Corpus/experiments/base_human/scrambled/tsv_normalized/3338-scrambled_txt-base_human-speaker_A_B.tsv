A:	uh-huh. yeah and i'm from pittsburgh so  oh well we'll forgive each other
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	yeah there are there are lots of bike paths. i know my son is a biker and he he's done the whole canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts.
B:	um.
A:	oh sure sure.
B:	and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh yeah i agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to
B:	oh that's great.
A:	right right obstinate obstinate.
B:	yeah.
A:	well we're all skinny farts so i it so when it comes to i like to cook and eat and to have mainly i guess i get to
B:	yeah exactly.
A:	and i had a great time doing that. it was really interesting.
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on on news that way. and then we would do a similar thing uh at uh ten forty-five because uh c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage uh and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. uh three of the networks here on their local news uh that if if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who murdered who or stole what. from whom.
A:	good to hear from you.
B:	yeah you know. so there's you know there's some things i think we can we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control.
A:	yeah. we do too. i think a lot of people agree the same.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	um well see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
A:	and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they they fear being a burden to to family members.
B:	oh god.
A:	well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high.
B:	and you're more receptive.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get lighter sentences
B:	i mean they
A:	if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice and relaxed.
B:	i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going. you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children.
A:	that's kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of atlanta and in georgia
B:	yeah. it would be great i mean uh the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive it's the glasses.
A:	yep.
B:	that we we wake up to television news and uh uh shower and dress and whatever to that and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together uh in a car we we chat at each other rather than than something else.
A:	well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year?
B:	uh-huh. right.
A:	i bet it had a pretty coat too.
B:	oh.
A:	did you really? what black ones?
B:	i i think so and and there's always the uh the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one and uh and then uh.
A:	yeah.
B:	that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket. sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something.
A:	uh-huh. well it sounds like ours are pretty similar. i live in one i don't have a swimming pool. and mine's about twenty-seven hundred square foot.
B:	well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them
A:	go ahead.
B:	oh that's one of the requirements i asked him. i said now you do like cats right. we don't
A:	um so you like to listen to uh a lot of music or do is it talk shows.
B:	if you're like i've i work with uh computer systems a lot. so it's kind of hard to say you know. if you're you know a brick layer somebody can look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down you know yeah you did a great job. but if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know. or especially if you write like papers you know.  or do design studies or something.
A:	huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	yes well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions. it sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
B:	uh-huh.
A:	there has that's right.
B:	yeah. and the the laws are all the rules. some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior criminal history you know where he's raped ten women
A:	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening but it wasn't you know too easy either.
B:	and they clean it up.
A:	yeah.
B:	but that's uh they're so close i i don't consider mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have.
A:	uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um yeah we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
B:	yes.
A:	well those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on and you know the and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
B:	everyone knows they're going get not going to get out.
A:	oh. those aren't too pleasant.
B:	so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well.
A:	i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in pittsburgh or something.
B:	okay well
A:	well well i've enjoyed talking to you.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	right. have to agree with you and i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it i just i don't know that it's always effective but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it. it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
B:	and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
A:	i mean i'm not kidding you.
B:	oh i know it the last gubernatorial race was oh it was awful.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah it's it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs at that point which could be one of you know many different night programs but it goes into night programs.
A:	yeah
B:	but.
A:	right.
