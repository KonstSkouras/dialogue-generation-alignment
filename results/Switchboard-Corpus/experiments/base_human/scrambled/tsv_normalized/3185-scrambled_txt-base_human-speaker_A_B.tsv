B:	fifty-five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty-five. and the ones that are shown they are inside that weight allowance.
A:	yeah  it's the unsweetened kind it's not like nestles quik.
B:	well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
A:	yep. and then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to. the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more.
B:	i thought that would be good experience for me.
A:	and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
B:	um.
A:	and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so. it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
B:	yeah.
A:	the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
B:	and i think this is really  is buyer beware.  well it is the best way  to do it interestingly.
A:	um yeah  right in the in the lukewarm milk. sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good. it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
B:	right. right. yeah it's nice to get out in the open air.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	because uh well like i say we live a way and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard.

B:	i know and that makes me so mad you know it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
A:	so i like gordon lightfoot do you know who he is?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	no.
B:	what about you?
A:	i guess like like they're nothing i guess nothing is as awful as abortion but like gun control and uh day care an things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know.
B:	you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and uh you know if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it
A:	unless it's it's a toy.
B:	yeah right right
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. i think i think texas is texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know california had it for a long time and then they uh took it off the books they repealed it
A:	and then there's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh south dakota the black hills.
B:	yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat. i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps.

B:	there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing.
A:	would be a definite deterrent and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people.
B:	but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work.
A:	no regardless of that fact. it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing
B:	uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different. once you get up in the five series and higher then all your repair costs go up significantly
A:	and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. but uh it's yeah.
B:	we started out with two with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
A:	and and i was trying to get my son to sing that. my husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song but they they do a lot of fun things. i think football is football is kind of a a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it. because you know there's just

A:	uh-huh.
B:	i float so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
A:	there's always that chance i don't know but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
B:	but oh he's been a wonderful cat.

B:	yeah.
A:	well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh
B:	uh cause i've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though
