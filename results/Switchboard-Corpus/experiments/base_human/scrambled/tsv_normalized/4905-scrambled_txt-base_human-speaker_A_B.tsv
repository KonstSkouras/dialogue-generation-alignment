A:	no, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. we've only been married for five and a half years. and, uh, we have two small children, and he had a, uh, just got transferred here to e-systems, so.
B:	bye-bye.
A:	yes.
B:	um, you look at your paycheck and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go um, what kind of, what kind of, uh, well have you pay a lot of in have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?
A:	well, anyway, i sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. although it has been difficult but, uh.
B:	small enough, you have a, just do it by hand?
A:	and, uh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	well, it will take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for denver.
A:	breast of chicken oh, gosh, yeah. how do you usually cook your deer?
B:	exactly. uh-huh. uh, i don't know. i, uh, you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, falsely accused but, uh, more than likely the people that are on the, the jury know what they're doing. uh, i mean you,
A:	oh.
B:	but, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
A:	and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course we water a little bit, that's just too much to water all at once, but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
B:	yeah.
A:	horses?
B:	yeah, it was pretty reasonable.
A:	i like the course, but i don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.
B:	yeah, well, the cowboys were america's football team,
A:	but, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. he was talking about, uh, the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print
B:	uh-huh.
A:	are you in texas, now?
B:	and i have a idea it's going to be a, a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than  before.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	they go all the way up to the supreme court, you know.
A:	um, that's probably true, but i guess there's other factors that,
B:	did you get to vote at the last one?
A:	yeah. well, dogs are real high maintenances, you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot, you know, you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing.
B:	but people that i have known that have done that, like from other countries, especially, from germany and finland, um, they are just, they have such a better, more mature, outlook on life
A:	and they're, they're incredible victims of crime. and part of it is this lack of,  lack of basic information, being dissimilated . and i'm not saying it's easy to do, and i know there are a few people who are trying, but, but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	and it's,
A:	huh. well, i, i work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place. i work for, uh, lincoln laboratory.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and so, i went to hawaii and then to australia and japan and china,
B:	huh.
A:	yeah, no, neither do i. i think it should be completely optional and you know.
B:	and she's lived with us for like five years. so i kind of know how it is to, how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home or, um, like we, i mean we've had those discussions, you know, about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile and
A:	okay, well, yes i do.
B:	the, yeah, okay.
A:	that's true.
B:	exactly and,
A:	so most of the, it's almost twenty years old, and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style uh, we have a friend that lives two blocks over, and his house is almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
B:	well, yeah. yeah, that's, uh, yeah, i think that's some of it. but, you know, i have, uh, i, i, it's just the way, you know, i think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
A:	but, typically, you know, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process and i suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.
B:	cause i've been, uh, especially in large corporations. you can really, you know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems i've found out. i've worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, you know, type companies. and it, and especially if you're doing like professional work. where you know, it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing you know.
A:	okay. do you have relatives in vernon then?
B:	you know what i mean?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale.
A:	and, but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways. and you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
