B:	or uh
A:	yeah. well i figure it's just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot so i want  to have a shop.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind.

A:	huh.
B:	i'm in dallas texas.
A:	and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling  to be doing that.
B:	right. that's a that's a common problem though. that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose.
A:	probably at all.
B:	and oh my husband just died.
A:	cocoa didn't think too much of it though. she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
B:	i kind of i think so too. i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it's it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can.
A:	uh got you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
B:	all right.
A:	but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh were clean.
B:	the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out.
A:	oh
