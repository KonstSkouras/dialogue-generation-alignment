A:	i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers
B:	it's probably happened to millions of people
A:	well great. that's excellent.
B:	uh-huh
A:	oh.
B:	yeah.
A:	and she is charging out of her mind already. and i'm going you just got off. that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person
B:	uh and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in in the car so we have the advantage of being able to uh read and drive although there seems to be from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving
A:	you know i'm i'm going gee this can't you know we'll have a freeze.
B:	did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of
A:	say that good i think that's like the state of virginia yeah that's great.
B:	and um uh that's what's nice about living more in the country you don't have to worry about any of that
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	yeah. right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it was really nice so
A:	but. anyway well it's uh nice talking to you. think we've uh covered all the subject.
B:	and they just get away with it and nothing happens.
A:	right  they don't want anyone with anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh that's one thing that they do. at that it's pretty easy to do.
A:	no i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	no. i don't i did it by hand
B:	no we are west.
A:	and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	did you really?
B:	but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society.
A:	so his solution was to burn plastic. collect it and burn it.
B:	i really don't watch that much t v what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch and then on the nights i can watch i'll pick out something.
A:	huh.
B:	i know it. i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean you honestly do. now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and you know to do it.
B:	well actually i much prefer a stick shift and what i'm i'm curious. i i know why i love a stick shift. why why did you want one?
A:	but now you know you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas
B:	yeah. so what's it been like up there?
A:	yes and
B:	and it was an older car
A:	my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way
B:	no no.
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
B:	well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal?
A:	so i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby.
B:	uh that's great.
A:	yeah well you learned then right?
B:	yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know.
A:	oh yeah they do.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh you are?
B:	i think so.
A:	most of the time
B:	i'm sure they will.
A:	okay. uh one of the things they talked about was uh did we what do we think about a judge making the decision?
B:	right.
A:	all right. thank you. bye bye.
B:	but that's another subject but
A:	well i just watch them.
B:	yes. uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh which seems so awful.
B:	and so uh you know at work a lot of people are you know i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our world we live in. most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it. uh you know college credit you know something you know
B:	uh other than that it was a at best.
A:	it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
B:	it was uh you know it's easier to join them than fight them.
A:	that's right.
B:	oh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah right.
A:	oh.
B:	oh.
A:	oh i see. uh-huh. well very good i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits
B:	um as far as the new hires i i hired on just early enough that i i missed it. um where the new hires were concerned but uh not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a precondition to being hired but um for the conditions that for our employment to change while you're on the job that's i i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset. it's uh you know it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh it's just it it's a really tough question
A:	uh-huh.
B:	golly.
A:	and i don't have that in my current operation but uh you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah in yeah it's really different because that's kind of the you know that's the chalk hills down there  limestone hills
A:	oh i like that too. but uh in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people.
B:	yeah.
A:	how do you dress for work?
B:	and uh i'm building a a log house at a farm that i have in east texas which is a hundred miles from here.
A:	i
B:	uh i take my boys well i took them up until this year they're grown and gone from home now
A:	no no i think the um sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the uh christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but she got credits for it?
B:	no.
A:	haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. so i i don't know where those guys are at these days. but i 
B:	and uh i was brought up the same way it doesn't matter what age you have just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know
A:	yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so.
B:	it really does and and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before. drugs of course uh a big part of it i think.
A:	we have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips.
B:	right. yeah
A:	all right. i've never done it before so i guess that's all i have to do right
B:	you know i like what he says and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
A:	i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you.
B:	yeah.
A:	i think some of them would rather be in jail
B:	it is. have you been living there very long?
A:	yeah.
B:	no.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know. if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury.
A:	what part of the country are you in?
B:	that's okay um i've i've thought about that too and um when we take our vacations we we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
A:	are you?
B:	uh-huh.
