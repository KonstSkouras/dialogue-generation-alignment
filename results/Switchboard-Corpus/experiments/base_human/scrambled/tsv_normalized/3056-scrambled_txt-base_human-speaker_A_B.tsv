A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
B:	but, uh,  sometimes i,  i said, i sometimes i wish i had more space you know.
A:	in clarion. well, i live in butler, but i'm at i'm at college. i'm at clarion university.
B:	let's see, *something missing? a.1? my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing, but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying and, um, taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in, you know, throughout that season, and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and, um, any kind of decorating for the holidays, you know,
A:	well, uh-huh.
B:	those compact discs,  really are good for cars because they don't melt,
A:	and it's a real big crunch, uh
B:	yeah, but that one's an easy one. it's like, just put in, a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine
A:	it feels, after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house, they know everything.
B:	i know, we wondered about that. but, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.
A:	so, it's a little bit more humane, i guess, it is,
B:	oh. i have one of those. yeah.
A:	that's right. that, that would be the problem. sure would.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	i think they're real reasonably priced, some of them, they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one, i got the black and decker kind. but, uh, it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the the milk, you know, and it does an excellent job, or just hand beat it. i guess you could use a hand mixer but i don't think it i don't think it gets it good enough.
B:	and.
A:	i don't know that you do. if it's random, then it's random
B:	oh well he lived through it, oh, i couldn't believe it. we went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, that didn't, uh,
A:	yeah, rats are not my favorite animals in the world, but i could see getting one from birth and everything.
B:	yeah, just work, short trips. no no heavy mileage. i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
A:	oh, so what would be the, your favorite meal to cook?
B:	but they uh quickly did away with it.
A:	yeah, i think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest
B:	i think it's, four or five,
A:	married?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it's only because they make a big stink over it. but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity they're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech but i would never
B:	and that i, i've never been on a jury, i've never had that experience, i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
A:	uh-huh. do you do that very often?
B:	yeah, i, sort of weird for me to have had one too but there, it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and, you know, it was easy. easy to take care of
A:	so i always just had a mother. so i always thought, when i have kids, you know, i really want to be involved with them.
B:	oh, you like the rain, do you?
A:	no.
B:	well, pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now
A:	well maybe something will open up for you.
B:	and dogs take a lot of, a lot more care than cats do. cats are pretty independent, you know, you feed them and they keep themselves clean and, if you, if you raise them right, you know, you don't have to worry about the litter box thing, where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.
A:	we, we originally lived in dallas and we met and got married
B:	uh-huh.
A:	so,
B:	yeah .
A:	i mean, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful
B:	yes.
A:	i mean, dallas is a very marked up area, although right now it's a lot lower um, because of all the layoffs and everything
B:	oh, the potato, they were, they're delicious but they, you don't get, seem to get that much for the space,
A:	yes. uh-huh.
B:	and so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in houston, it's, uh, the lines are long.
A:	of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course, but, uh, during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them. so,
B:	oh, catfish is wonderful.
A:	yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too. .
B:	uh-huh. well that's great. where else have you been?
A:	right.
B:	oh, okay. i see.
A:	well, no, not really
B:	so, can i just ask you, are you canadian?
A:	yeah.
B:	and there would be like thirty people. so people talk about, you know, big family reunions and i think, like i have a friend who just went to, like, wyoming to some big ranch, you know, where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion.
A:	it gives you confidence. in my business if i call on the the j c penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago, then i wear coat and tie. if i call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, i might be casual.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. well, we used to, we don't as much anymore, but, uh, we used to. we kind of slowed down a little bit. but, uh, i think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining. if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
B:	uh, what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. have you,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and that, it's, it's fine, because then i can just say, okay fine, you bring this, you bring this, you bring this, we're done.
A:	oh, really?
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	but, uh, they're, they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that, uh, the democrat that he is,  and mario cuomo
A:	yes.
B:	uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
