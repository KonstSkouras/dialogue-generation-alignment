A:	um, and it's, it's, i, i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i, until i met with them. and i realized that, they, some of the information that i just, you know, don't even realize and know is information, they don't have. and i never thought, well, i guess that is something you need to know, you know. people getting into trouble because they come here, and so they start farming on, uh, available land, you know. like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it. but then someone comes along and says you can't do that, you know. why can't they? they have no idea why not, some, some of them, you know. the ones that have been here longer and have been in, you know, understand now. but when they initially come over,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	um, but it's a beautiful home and, i mean, my brother lives,
B:	i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
A:	you know, we're losing certain, races of people.
B:	she says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. so it's kind of, uh, i don't know. i mean, i don't, i don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's,
A:	well, it was pretty reasonable. i, it was around ten dollars for lunch. okay, which is kind of high for lunch i guess.
B:	that's right. i even had friends when i was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now i, i, i believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,
A:	do you think most states have that or?
B:	a type of work station?
A:	oh, now my husband and i, we go different places. but our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.
B:	no.
A:	yeah. but, uh, that's great. well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.
B:	that works, i'll go do that
A:	but, um, you know, i just keep looking at, and i say, jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
B:	people running up saying, oh, what's the score, what's the score?
A:	thank goodness. but still, it could.
B:	um.
A:	um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know, all cats are indoor cats,
B:	we had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff. i know, like a week or so ago, i live in a, in a town house, which is, you know, it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work, she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything. and nobody thought any different, they just thought she was moving. it was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned
A:	right, because that would the eight o'clock here.
B:	right. that's true. yeah, well, it, it, you know, you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,  done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,
A:	right.
B:	yeah. yeah, i agree
A:	and they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical.
B:	and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard, that i can't see them.
A:	well, i tell you i, i just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, i think it was an ad in, in our publication at texas instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
B:	i think i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children. we,  have three children who are eleven, nine, and eight.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh. well we have cable, but we only have cinemax, and uh, i think our favorite night is, uh, monday night,
B:	g m, uh, chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, well they actually have an electric minivan. yeah. their, their caravan. but it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars right now.
A:	usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
B:	yeah.
A:	so, uh, i,
B:	and, uh.  the thing about it, you know, now that i've found, is that we get such good coverage on t v, or at least such, i don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the time magazine, there's nothing in it you don't know.
A:	and, i don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
B:	yes, it would almost have to be, i suppose. if you, if you had to chose, i guess i would, i am sure i would take the lethal injection.
A:	oh.
B:	and that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, god, i'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,
A:	and, uh, i enjoy them coming, but for short doses
B:	yeah. well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
A:	that's right and,
B:	but, when, during the winter time i think they, they move south or something
A:	it was nice talking to you too. bye-bye.
B:	and it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.
A:	oh, okay.
B:	well you lived in france,
A:	they became a very successful immigrant group. but, and, but a lot of people coming over from vietnam, right now, coming from worn torn countries, are, are not having the same success. i think some people have just assumed, well, why, why can't you be successful? the japanese were, or the chinese were, or something. and it's really much more complicated.
B:	yeah.
A:	okay, okay. because i, i had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but i didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
B:	and, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college, but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, it's like, what does it, what does it cost. it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose. now they go to a state college and they live at home you know,
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	that was kind of a funny song but they sure do, it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here. even when they were losing pitifully, you know, people still support them. we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs, we love the
B:	so what do you think about, uh, recycling programs in atlanta, julie?
A:	well, not really. it's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
B:	or, you know, they're both just as bad, and i'll say, well, i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party, and, um, but yeah. you know, that's not the best way but,
A:	oh, i think it is.
B:	lord.
A:	oh.
B:	it was real nice.
A:	that's cool.
B:	yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, i guess, uh
A:	um, i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed
B:	i think i know what you're is it like a hand held?
A:	yeah sure
B:	he was an, an assistant district attorney in chicago at, uh, and while he was writing the book, and, uh, my sister-in-law lives in chicago, and she had, before it actually got big, she sent me this book saying, you might like this, this guy is, you know, from here.
A:	my word.
B:	and, uh, or they fool the, the defense in thinking that they're, you know, because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
A:	of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
B:	yeah.
A:	on a b c?
B:	i think maybe more information should be given out about it.
A:	yeah.
B:	oh, how neat.
A:	and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem, uh, even a more major problem. uh, in dallas, some of the major problems, uh, drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now. there is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh, people trying to get money for drugs.
B:	so when i drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.
A:	have they done that in garland?
B:	so, of course, the, the attorneys,
A:	different places every year. we,
B:	but,
A:	i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.
B:	right, uh-huh.
A:	they don't know that i don't use drugs. they just tested me once.
B:	but, uh, i'm sure people in, uh, you know, in, uh, galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it, uh, pensacola is a navy town.
A:	yeah i don't know, uh, i guess it just depends on how they manage it.
B:	right. so, uh, but i, i feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting.
A:	yeah, uh, uh, isn't that weird?
B:	uh uh, uh, although i do, uh, a lot of,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i don't know what it was, we had a real rainy spring
A:	no earthly idea.
B:	right.
A:	well it, i, i agree with you there because i know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	the economy is lousy
B:	the thing about when it gets hot here is, i don't like the humidity, that part i don't care about.
A:	and they, and, and they certainly can't carry it themselves
B:	there's nothing like them. they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
A:	um, now i'm, actually i'm, i'm not working anymore. i'm a student, i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,
B:	now, it was very nicely done.
A:	okay.
B:	what have you got growing right now?
A:	how far out from the city, i mean, do you,
B:	really?
A:	we're probably about an hour away from sharon.
B:	certainly.
A:	oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway. would you not?
B:	right. i agree with that. because i know personally myself, i've been in the same job for three years, it will be three years in august and i've already been drug tested three times.
A:	yeah, this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
A:	yeah, i liked your idea too, there.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh, so, i guess we do get it from people too. oh, you mentioned c n n, of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news, you know?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh, sure.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
A:	true.
B:	when we get an hour more,
A:	well, they're not
B:	i just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so,
