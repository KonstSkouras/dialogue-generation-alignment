A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah yeah i think that we're too easy.
A:	and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
B:	and then uh and then you and then you pass it on.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property and it would make you ill to see this.
B:	yeah.
A:	top of top of the line.
B:	yeah and and uh upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now now it's now it's a fast machine
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right right. uh-huh.
A:	bye-bye.
B:	say out instead of out you say out. did you know that?
A:	my word isn't that sorry. that's sorry.
B:	uh my see my father is ninety-two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah
A:	yes. i it just just doesn't make sense
B:	because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people like
A:	oh that's great.
B:	but all the all three of them dog cat and skunk used to chase each other all through the house.
A:	you want to go first?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	sure.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides. um and i've have no hope for solutions. but uh i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue. i have worked with uh uh a little bit with refugees from  southeast asia uh who've come over. uh you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there. and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had. and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be. because i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area.
B:	so that was that that's a nice place. canada is very nice.
A:	in africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there. so i i you know and it's beginning other countries that's what's his point. this was an international conference where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
A:	probably um uh let's see i like the looks of the lincoln town car
B:	it's walls and it's furniture but  there's nobody there.
A:	and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
B:	well i really the last car we got was a was a used car. i really don't prefer buying a new car. i like to let somebody else pay for that
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but you know i i see these magazines where you know dig your your own deck.
A:	i think that'd be an interesting experience. but uh i haven't done that
B:	in the way that it's applied or it's applied at all?
A:	oh oh yeah well um um it may be that um it was recently replaced by actually by um by what may be my favorite t v show of because sort of uh um twin peaks.
B:	so i don't know i i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go.
A:	but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. so i i think most of them are there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from
B:	but it's comfort. uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. uh
A:	uh-huh. right.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. yeah yeah.
A:	i'm not either really.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face. of course he didn't die.
B:	wow.
A:	there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here and so
B:	right.
A:	i think you do. you feel very good after you exercise. i think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
B:	uh because i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes uh regulation in texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year *82 and 84 same utt?
A:	how about your community?
B:	and he's like oh thank you so much.
A:	the first one i got. he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment.
B:	and they get a slap on the wrist. they get thirty days in jail
A:	i don't i don't i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also. but uh but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. i agree with that.
A:	huh.
B:	yeah. well i think part of the the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures people um you know just go on and on and on. i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if it what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers. they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know who would see it.
A:	um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper and so uh i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also uh some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines and uh at work i also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events. uh how about yourself?
B:	different set
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car.
A:	there's uh maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
A:	but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now  caught more than twice or something uh  it there's uh a death penalty associated with it.
B:	yeah.
A:	you would still have something.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it's just so it's a lot of work too
B:	yeah it really was. i enjoyed it there. but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because they like to see things grow. they've done a couple of little seed projects and so i think it would be fun for them.
A:	and the only other avenue that i can think of is uh looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. as for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars.
B:	well uh no i i don't get as much exercise as i as i should as or as i would like to uh uh these days. i seems to be to easy to get busy with other things. uh i have in the past uh jogged and and run and every every january and every september i start out again and then it tapers off
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah i have got some of those too cause i love flowers
A:	oh.
B:	all right bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said where were they
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an aids uh conference in uh california.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't. uh
B:	are you mormons?
A:	uh-huh. well i bet you uh-huh.
B:	oh yes i mean when i had uh i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities. and uh there she was terrific she was really terrific.
A:	right you don't notice it  as much
B:	uh-huh.
A:	than you sure. than it when you were younger uh-huh.
B:	well now wait a minute there
