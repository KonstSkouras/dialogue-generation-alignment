A:	what. oh, okay, maybe i'll call you back after, after the recording is finished. actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes. i can't remember.
B:	you know, i don't know, or a person personally.
A:	i i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with them. i try to teach them not to get into things.
B:	and because they're so deficient in english, they haven't been able to get jobs.
A:	right. just wasn't socially acceptable.
B:	um, i would never, i would never have a problem with anyone testing me, but i can understand why people would object. so, i guess, uh, i guess, uh, i'm kind of mixed on it, still at this point.
A:	uh-huh.
