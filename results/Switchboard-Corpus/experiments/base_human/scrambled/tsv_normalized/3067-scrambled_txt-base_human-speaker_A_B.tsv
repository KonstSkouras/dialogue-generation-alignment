A:	this is gross.
B:	lots of wildlife huh? yeah.
A:	and it played by itself?
B:	what did you wind up with?
A:	and they just thoroughly you know enjoy that
B:	and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week i uh manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus so she you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon til close. uh so we have
A:	yeah. i don't i if i you know if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really.
B:	she loves lots of windows. that's great.
A:	okay.
B:	yeah. i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean. they're not worth it
A:	oh that will be good.
B:	uh-huh. that's right.
A:	of course their seasons are switched.
B:	uh-huh it really could and uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
A:	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
B:	out here at manford they have a you know a a a real good facility and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that.
A:	yeah.
B:	my brother had fish when i was a kid i remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the um gosh what do you call it fish tank. and fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser. i'll never forget that because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish
A:	and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water
B:	uh that's came out around the first of the year.
A:	yeah. but it's funny that uh i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania. i'm not even sure of that but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that. and it surprised and even florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
B:	uh-huh
A:	we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures and i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
B:	and uh so that's the program that they're using there.
A:	well
B:	right.
A:	really.
B:	yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them.
A:	i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
B:	and is it um a natural gas and
A:	yeah yeah.
B:	in terms of motivation and incentive yeah.
A:	but um i have um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh free lance magazine writing and some educational writing. and um for a while i had a um uh a partnership with a in an advertising agency with another woman who is a an artist. so i did some advertising and p r but
B:	uh um um no not really. in that but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i do. that's about my mother's sisters you know
A:	well that's okay. i guess it's an easy thing to do. so you're you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have?
B:	well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. uh for the bad times of the company.
A:	and so one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
B:	yeah i i new york does not
A:	yeah that's i mean that's certainly a possibility in in we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
B:	so k a l a i think c h a n d.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah. i i feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury. that that that right
A:	yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
B:	i exactly where she is. but um we met in paris.
A:	this this friend of mine has well it's the same guy that was watching uh my german shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on friday and took he's got a full a pure bred golden retriever and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. and this they just they had a ball romping around
B:	and
A:	that for oh uh-huh.
B:	but that
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. right and then the family home evening too.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah definitely.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	none to cook. i don't like to cook
A:	are you ready to start?
B:	do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
A:	or you know plead insanity.
B:	yeah i like having cats around or pets around in general i i favor dogs over cats actually but
A:	i used to when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys i'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.
B:	okay yeah. well you just do
A:	and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	anyways but uh. yeah we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know mandatory life sentences for murder.
A:	well that's great that you all can work that out. that's really good.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
B:	but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
A:	i mean not not to this large scale as iraq but that
B:	right.
A:	yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the b m w are produced in uh uh stutgardt and uh and munich
B:	it doesn't make sense. uh but it's you know one of the most uh productive crop in the world  is corn.
A:	good-bye.
B:	he's a little boy
A:	just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else
B:	i think that starts in sixth grade.
A:	every time you they could buy their way out.
B:	but it was good. i mean it was it at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid a little bit extra. but the kids were
A:	she has twelve children.
B:	oh well that sounds like fun too
A:	yeah. i mean and and in the once you junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. well no i guess it in junior high it was still three. then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects. uh which
B:	but i i think it can't be something that's mandatory.
A:	so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. right now we're trying to avoid it but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him. uh i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home.
B:	well you know
A:	yeah the population's been really up. they've uh they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much.
B:	two hours where?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. so is it uh are we doing lethal injection now?
B:	oh exactly. each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range.
