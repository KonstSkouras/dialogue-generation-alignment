A:	well i do too i do too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. but then we started thinking especially in plano the weather is so hot in august that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
B:	and uh and the yeah younger one is uh uh the sports one and the whatever season it is he's he's playing although football is really his favorite
A:	well about nursing homes and and older people.
B:	uh-huh. okay so they know that. and that's ...
A:	uh and uh so we're we're part we're actually part of m i t. so it's very much the same kind of place and uh  the technical institution.
B:	yeah and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
A:	yeah. yeah we uh we've got you know i'll store all our christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
B:	uh-huh. yes. that's a it's a tough tough question it really is.
A:	right.
B:	emmett smith.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah an injection
A:	yeah yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	wow.
B:	yeah yeah.
A:	but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple. it's designed to be added on to.
B:	yeah. i've i've heard some i mean i've heard statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education. i mean within like within the same uh income groups.
A:	yeah.
B:	well they were i was watching some show the other day and they were talking about uh mass murderers
A:	well you're really not too bad. yeah.
B:	but.
A:	right right.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us
B:	yeah. that's true. and they won't raise our taxes.
A:	what are your cats' names.
B:	right no they don't. i should make you 
A:	um.
B:	yeah. i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um uh well it is very frightening and scary. i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases and uh i mean whether
A:	yeah uh-huh.
B:	very interesting.
A:	well it's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
B:	some of our neighbors were doing it and so you know when i found out some places to take it and um like um they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there and i know that they're going to use you know the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. put lights and stuff
A:	okay bye-bye.
B:	uh we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know remodeled.
A:	oh how sweet.
B:	well anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up.
A:	and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh we've got plenty in fact we've got far too many. you're in uh what flower mound?
B:	and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children.
A:	you know stupid guys and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy.
B:	then i think it makes a big difference.
A:	and it is too far south for me
B:	you know. that's just that's my views you know.
A:	yes. that that was true for mine too. uh although i i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. you know i  think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education.
B:	because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. she just
A:	i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard. i i really don't enjoy doing that. i enjoy having a nice looking yard
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. um. uh-huh. you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment. so if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person. and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh but i i don't think that's done much anywhere that's kind of drastic punishment.
B:	but uh they want too much money.
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	oh no.
A:	well what about random testing though.
B:	and then i have my freedom. i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do.
A:	well we have a funny commercial around here. it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world's problems or something. so  i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh
B:	yeah. i'm down here at t i.
A:	well there is so many chances for appeal that it
B:	they don't warp.
A:	and
B:	i can't believe they have the nerve to do that.
A:	i like that.
B:	okay. uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it? word processing obviously.
A:	but
B:	oh okay. do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball?
A:	the economy around here is real poor
B:	right.
A:	have you?
B:	and did it again and uh
A:	yeah um.
B:	what's the topic?
A:	and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also.
B:	and i i don't think i'll do it again
A:	um but
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	and i feel like i would never put them in a home. but i wonder how much you know if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something.
B:	and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step. she'd just get on the first step and lay down. you know in the summertime when it's really really hot.
A:	yeah. yeah are you do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
B:	i haven't bought it now for about eight years. but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising.
A:	we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know. we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits
B:	yeah yeah it's getting real close to
A:	well good.
B:	chili.
A:	sounds like you have a little one just like i do
B:	well i think that in some cases it is warranted.
A:	no
B:	it's like get a painter you know or something a artist. it's like well you how do you really rate you know michelangelo you know how would you tell if he was you know really good or so-so or whatever
A:	well um i was a technical writer for many years um
B:	right.
A:	now how do you mean that? i know it
B:	you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family. and
A:	so. uh do
B:	uh it use to be use to be a uh uh have a lot of heavy industry
A:	okay
B:	yeah uh it's yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine you know it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff
A:	yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
B:	now uh well i i still go back to ...
A:	but these people obviously weren't.
B:	i hate to put it quite that way.
A:	great.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	sure did.
A:	oh out of as opposed to the insurance paying the bills
B:	and so and in the book you know even he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. and uh because he he mentions he he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth. and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
A:	who do you think? the dallas cowboys.
B:	well so so . so your wife does she work right now?
A:	yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh  and that they have to do something.
B:	and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get. and they all said golden retriever and i said okay put it under twenty pounds. and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frize which is a
A:	i've seen that. yeah.
B:	yeah. that's true.
A:	no huh-uh. uh i think they're interesting.
B:	well i'm not talking about any loss. i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. but it's an an amount they're designed to sting them a little for their  negligence.   for gross wanton negligence in a claim.
A:	um. uh-huh. uh-huh. right lots of their picture and life story and everything.
B:	but it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping  our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it.
A:	i'll let you go first.
B:	yeah. definitely i think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
A:	yeah and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up you know i just was there you know like i'm loaded i'm here you know and uh it was just kind of funny because you know but we got to sit by first base if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	seems like i just bought it.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah they're not worth a year. or some people just just can't even afford it you know whatever. i mean the peace corps doesn't pay very well. you know?
B:	it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state.
A:	uh
B:	heavy science. are you like in the particle particle research or anything like that or is it more um applied physics?
A:	but the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh.
A:	i just i go hysterical when they don't come home.
B:	yeah yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know.
A:	and then
B:	hopefully it's not my wife.
A:	uh-huh. so you what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them.
B:	right would you use that for city driving and racing?
A:	um i have no idea.
B:	yeah. so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
A:	probably. oh.
B:	rome new york yeah.
A:	not for the price?
B:	well uh uh about the same i dress for school. i uh i am a graduate student so i don't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time. which is nice.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	that's not too bad. that's north.
B:	how do we usually?
A:	okay
B:	the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh
A:	i'd i'd love to go back there. there's just not time there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything.
B:	yeah well of course in the uh i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt
A:	every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule where you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs. instead of taking them up there solid.
B:	i would hope we could do that and then go from there.
A:	well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes.
B:	because i since i came from my father has uh five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters. so i both of my parents had big families and we always we always got together just always. now it's different because i live here and i you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different.
A:	oh really.
B:	yeah i've been lucky in that respect that i don't uh don't travel too much .
A:	uh but
B:	no that's right.
A:	and we only have one. we tore all the rest of them up.
B:	and you know a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for. and uh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about
A:	yeah.
B:	and i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real like you said
A:	and then um actually married in pittsburgh and that's that's not what they want to hear on this call uh
B:	anyway. you don't have children?
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
B:	and why?
A:	it is uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
