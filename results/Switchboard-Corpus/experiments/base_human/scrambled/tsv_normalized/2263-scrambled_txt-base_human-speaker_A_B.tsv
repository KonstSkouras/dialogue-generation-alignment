A:	i used to be a builder.
B:	really.
A:	of course not.
B:	and uh you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter. he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone. now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know.
A:	uh i uh some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
B:	yeah.
A:	i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know. but i i really feel bad for the people i see not very i'm not really really experienced but like i said i just have that one family and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be. but
B:	oh gosh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think the last i heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars.
A:	well there are a lot of things that people i think general
B:	well it's uh we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization
A:	well that's good. well  i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them. i haven't  been to a lot
B:	i know well my son the my fourth grader he is
A:	um. well here uh i'm not sure how many dallas has had. i've uh houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i i don't know. a a number every week.
B:	and then it was all year there was just copperheads everywhere.
A:	my my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the the people that have written certain songs then he buys the pieces that have that person. you know on it.
B:	instead of being watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever. uh and because of that we began towards the middle and of the war i guess about two and a half or three weeks in we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would uh watch uh fifteen minutes before fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news or our local news. we would watch c n n until six thirty then we would watch uh a rotating network news of either uh a b c c b s or n b c and we we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one.
A:	yeah fairly recently. well that's really sad. i hadn't thought about that in a long time.
B:	and they had misclassed the sex of back there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the price of a mouse
A:	yeah.
B:	oh yeah that's great too. uh-huh. yeah we did some remodeling when we bought a house we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering that's fun.
A:	so uh it was sort of
B:	well it wasn't really. it was um uh to see an old relative.
A:	gosh small world huh?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. we're doing some here in in cash valley the community here.
B:	i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. you're talking about the person's already been found guilty right
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah i've done it before and when i was in in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it
B:	yeah it is a tough question.
A:	yeah and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone. and
B:	oh wow. that is really interesting. are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened
A:	right. they don't have one of those. so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card. we have we could have credit cards running down our ears.
B:	yeah and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine.
A:	yeah where are you?
B:	yeah if you implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
A:	oh see i'm not uh i'm not a dog person at all
B:	and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened and and base the sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
A:	no your i have a friend now that has seven. and um and they're all eight and under and nine and under
B:	yeah. it was a landmark is the one who built it.
A:	and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
B:	i'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town. i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm going to find a cat. so
A:	yeah it's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that's like a ku klux klan member something got elected.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
B:	and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them.
A:	just hadn't heard much about them lately.
B:	yeah yeah well i i went to dallas uh when i worked for t i in abilene and uh i'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and you know through that off off the freeway.
A:	that  that's real good.
B:	right or what you've heard on t v which i think is just outrageous.
A:	you go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there. and i always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
B:	chapel hill is kind of a a ritzy city or whatever. i mean it's kind of i'm i'm sure there is problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate. compare compared to to durham has probably got the worst. they've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	it's been denied fortunately but
A:	you know my husband's always got it on.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	no i don't think there was. um i know a little bit more from a a co-worker. her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.
A:	you know and so it's it is uh we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small uh uh business.
B:	yeah we two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh pretty reasonable price we think.
A:	yes.
B:	uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the uh nineteen ninety ninety-one whatever nineteen ninety-one uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else
A:	oh.
B:	um.
A:	that's real nice.
B:	i mean it sounds like a train. we have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house
A:	yeah. no. *aa
B:	but they talk about things that i my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know
A:	they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to support that group.
B:	yeah my name's bill. well
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	is it that's good.
B:	what does that house got attraction?
A:	oh i wouldn't either. there'd be no way.
B:	i think so and a lot i think people are are used to now saying what's what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right right right. and you really have to make uh quite a bit of money. the wife doesn't make it worth it with the cost of day-care.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.

B:	isn't that nice. i mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know
A:	snow
B:	oh that's good too.
A:	uh-huh. and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime.
B:	um that's possible i guess.
A:	you think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage and you get. uh-huh. it's historic events huh.
B:	nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
A:	hopefully
B:	uh-huh yeah.
A:	uh-huh. but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. which uh i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me.
B:	and i'm okay. but when it gets too hot then it's that i don't like that
A:	that's so stupid that you all have two teams.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh.
A:	my my daughter's in the um fourth grade
B:	that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow brownie meeting.
A:	sure sure. so
B:	so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
A:	uh we're going to go for a conference in september and so hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too.
B:	but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined.
A:	oh do they really. curbside pick up?
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care  center.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	ri- exactly.
