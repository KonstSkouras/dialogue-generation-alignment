A:	i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
B:	but they they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would come up and ask you you know if if you want to buy different things and really after awhile it really gets annoying
A:	ooh that would be nice.
B:	uh-huh. sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer.
