A:	rome, new york, okay, well, texas, let me look at my husband and ask him, to some one else in yes, they do he's reminding me of where i live, yeah.
B:	oh, yeah.
A:	well, that's right, because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming
B:	uh, i think so. it should be.
A:	it's like a slap on the fingers for them.
B:	but, uh, you know, i, i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
A:	yes.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	but you can,
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
A:	that would be fair.
B:	oh, really?
A:	that's about the only real bonus
B:	i don't know.
A:	well, thank you very much. bye-bye.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh, yeah, i'd do it, i'd use it for both. the nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
B:	so it's real neat.
A:	well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, i was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, i think it's well worth it. i just demand that time for myself. now i've learned to do that
B:	i was twenty-nine when i had my first child and, uh, i would not have been real fulfilled. i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child.
A:	so, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things. so i don't know.
B:	if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them i think everyone would, i, they'd,  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face,  as they did it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
A:	a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and, but i disagree with that, i.
B:	yeah, but you really need to see that movie. i, i we bought the movie and i i don't know how many times i've seen it.
A:	uh-huh. yeah, i just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate, i mean i just don't, uh, oh, i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, and i just, the subject, i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things
B:	hey,
A:	yes. and it's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do.
B:	yes.
A:	no actually i haven't been all through europe,  like i haven't been to italy yet.
B:	oh yes, yes.
A:	uh-huh. well, do, do you think that's good or bad?
B:	i listen to the radio, uh, probably five or six hours a week, but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical, uh, station here ,  for music purposes.
A:	wow, yeah.
B:	that's always a good thing. vegetable trays always go over so well, because i think people get tired of eating junk. i mean, i think they like to have healthy stuff too, you know it's,
A:	and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down. and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling and that, was mine.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?
B:	kind of, uh, little guy in there. he, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.
A:	and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out. there's a german word for it that's elegant, but i never can remember what it was, uh, but, but that they're, they're being winnowed because they're, where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially.
B:	to her go talk to daddy about it. excuse me.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	do you have children?
B:	because i mean, i play the flute and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so, but, uh, i like a lot, uh, i like classical music just because of the, when, i, i don't play, i like jazz music but
A:	really. uh-huh.
B:	i'm not sure what you're talking about.
A:	yeah.
B:	but i lived in in florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there, but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.
A:	and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
B:	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and i i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.
A:	because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're, you're dooming them to being underclass people.
B:	yes, uh-huh. that's, that's fairly recent, i don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of texas. before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.
A:	okay, looks like we're ready to go. capital punishment, uh, the problem i have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, but i don't think that it really actually does that. i don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe i shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, i might get the gas chamber or something like that. they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it. and, uh, how about you
B:	they don't get out of the house, they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it.
A:	oh, boy, i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
B:	and it's the alsatian that's the kid's dog. it's just, you see them in europe and they're just lovely.
A:	they're all my parents age. and, uh, so he's got, you know, his retirement though is really twenty-four hours a day. they have a day care two days a week. they call it senior citizen day care. but she goes in the senior citizen center.
B:	yeah, i do too.
A:	right
B:	i mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again.
A:	yeah, you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
B:	um.
A:	i know florida has it.
B:	it's a farm community, and we.
A:	yeah.
B:	i haven't done it in quite awhile since i moved down here.
A:	yeah, i thought they had some sort of, i mean, i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not, that's great.
B:	you know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.
A:	uh, but, you know. we really need the rain that we've been getting, and it has not today, but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day.
B:	uh-huh. yeah it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. so it's  a good, good  vehicle.
A:	and i think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the united states and canada is so different, from the from south america, and central america.
B:	something like that.
A:	and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
B:	yeah.
A:	well, i'm not even sure all of them are anymore. at least in this area.
B:	some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that, that aspects changing.
A:	uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, american family counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. but, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
B:	i, i don't know what foley's is
A:	but i think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use. i mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore.
B:	yeah, and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,
A:	they're always, always happy. i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy.
B:	yes.
A:	so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.
