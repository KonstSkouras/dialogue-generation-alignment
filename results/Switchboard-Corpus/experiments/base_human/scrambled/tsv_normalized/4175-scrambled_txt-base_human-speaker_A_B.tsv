A:	no, no.
B:	oh, that's exciting.
A:	because kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.
B:	uh-huh, oh, yeah, i was amazed i was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in, you know, it's like, wow
A:	that's right.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh, yeah, maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.
B:	yeah, pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,
B:	i've had a skunk
A:	so they're pretty much just reunited always
B:	well, how does this grab you? how did this grab you? uh, this, i, i mean, i'm, i'm a lady, but this, i heard this on a christian program and it was, uh, about the n e a and, that's the national endowment for arts, and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.
A:	right.
B:	yeah.
A:	i see.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. i mean, i can handle people, people selling drugs, you know, it's, it's wrong, but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for. but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
A:	but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
B:	when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house
A:	i know, i really will do that the next time, i buy it too.
B:	i've always said that it, it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.
A:	we've been real lucky. so,
B:	well, i mean, were there witnesses?
A:	thank you, bye-bye.
B:	and, uh, it, i think that's what happens when they get scattered, the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.
A:	yes, that's similar to georgia.
B:	well, if you,  enjoy it too, you know, you, you can get out in the morning when, before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to,
A:	well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
B:	that's great.
A:	but, uh, that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual.
B:	oh ours are pretty calm.
A:	yeah, we had, uh, i don't know, my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so, you know, and he's sit in front of it and, and he went by and he said, whoops, and he backed up, and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,
B:	so,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yes, oh, of course.
A:	have a lovely day.
B:	and, um, you know, although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them
A:	yes.
B:	yeah.
A:	they're up and doing fine.
B:	you had eight boys and one girl?
A:	ooh, that would be nice.
B:	oh, i see.
A:	so he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. he puts the kids to bed,
B:	there's no question about that, so.
A:	other than that he gets scared to death. if you shut that door he goes into hiding.
B:	that dog is bred out of three european dogs. the belgian tervurien, a german skutzhund, and a makes a i always forget the third one. i can see it. uh, uh, but the third one is a children's dog.
A:	how about the health food, uh, restaurants? well, like this one but it's probably not advertised as such, is it? or,
B:	yeah.
A:	my kids are involved in sports. my daughter has played basketball for six years, and my son plays football. i, my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
B:	it's a little place, looks like a castle.
A:	and it is hard to make, uh, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
B:	i, uh, i i, i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
A:	yeah, we, uh, she's, uh, into aerobics, and, uh, and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half
B:	philadelphia?
A:	yeah, that's very true. you know, how many, is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country, and i guess, i, i live near washington, being in, in baltimore, it's something like one in four people, in the washington,  area, are lawyers,
B:	oh, uh-huh. yeah.
A:	oh, really. oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. um.
B:	oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats.
A:	yeah. uh, very
B:	oh wow.
A:	they were. that's right. we use a lot, we sure do.
B:	not with me personally. it is with a lot of other people.
A:	so he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time.
B:	yeah there you go.
A:	and he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.
B:	really. that was smart. yeah.
A:	okay.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yes. i think we ought to worry about our own species.
B:	yeah. i, i usually get it started for my wife
A:	huh.
B:	yes, i love to cook.
A:	i don't know. yeah, our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now. i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
B:	and, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
A:	yeah, yeah. well i'm, uh, i'm a second lieutenant in the air force and so i travel a lot.
B:	oh, yeah. well, most of my camping, i haven't done much since i was a kid but, uh, we'd, basically, take the tent up in the sierras and, uh, usually just camp near some stream  or some lake.
A:	and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have, oh, i'll have less of a bug problem at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
B:	sort of easy listening because you like country but then,
A:	taxes.
B:	you could be responsible for that yourself.
A:	well, that's interesting.
B:	easiest way out maybe. no, i don't think it's a monetary thing.
A:	the next generation, uh-huh.
B:	oh.
A:	so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
B:	really.
A:	right, you know, they, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. but, i'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it's, it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go into, well, out of the kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, i think bangladesh would have been a good example or some, some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good.
B:	the dallas cowgirls, huh.
A:	i, i, i'd force them. i think that, uh, i think it would be, i think i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.
B:	i'm sold on nissans.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well, it was nice to talk to you. i know they've started over in richardson where my dad lives. they pick up newspapers, i think.
A:	right, or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that.
B:	wow! that really surprises me.
A:	five minutes, oh, okay.
B:	so it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
A:	i, i'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what i understand from various net readings, it, the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get. with some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?
B:	i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the, they seem to be social, they seem to be economically driven also.
A:	yeah, i think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
