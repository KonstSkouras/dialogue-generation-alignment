A:	uh-huh.
B:	no because if you go back there then you can never get out.
A:	we live uh we lived in minneapolis for about five years.
B:	and um i killed that one within a very short amount of time.
A:	so. so it gives you idea that
B:	that's right.
A:	let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over. ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf.
B:	well that's yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing.
A:	um
B:	i think i think pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i'm from uh  from pennsylvania also just uh just outside  of philadelphia
A:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	so i guess we've kind of neglected latin america.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh okay your talking about
B:	right. so i think we find out what's happening in the city uh on a fairly frequent basis over a over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
A:	yeah.
B:	you bet.
A:	right.
B:	right. well i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom you know and all that stuff
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
B:	oh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
A:	boy that really that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
B:	how did you what did you do
A:	long way uh
B:	well that's true and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it's
A:	you don't want the government to spend your money. you want to be able
B:	sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh that's right they pull the strings.
A:	yeah that that would all start at at um that would all start at at eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven. we have um at seven o'clock we just have um the they'll play you know they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight
B:	oh which state is that?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	what kind of crimes would you use it for?
A:	that's life that's how life goes.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and um uh it's not a big deal really i mean they're they're happier when we're around but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog.
B:	we don't regret paying taxes. we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax.
A:	uh well no i can't really complain. i'm a student um and i i work as a co-op at uh georgia tech research institute. and uh i'm going to get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes and uh and uh  one of my parents is still claiming me.
B:	so we will play either out there or at firewheel. that is usually where we play but i have played you know different courses in in the dallas area.
A:	right.
B:	uh-huh. um i see.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit and then we take them take them in.
A:	well there's a lot of fat in meat.
B:	oh wow.
A:	well yeah. it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor. he's on the other side of a hill.
B:	they got that uh what is that safer soap uh b t spray this year.
A:	oh.
B:	yeah. i i've always liked that. the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back.
A:	so there's the potential that perhaps you know the u s budget might want to take a look at it's uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages. i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it
B:	uh-huh.
A:	you don't sound like you're in the north. you sound like you're in the south somewhere.
B:	oh i do too
A:	uh
B:	uh well i don't actually live in the city but i'd probably say that's roughly right. i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution uh and sale of drugs.
A:	uh-huh major.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	sure. let somebody get something out of it.
B:	but there's probably something else that might make you. because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for the jury.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well a little bit for the price
A:	right yeah i'm a graduate student and let's face it i don't make any money so
B:	uh it there's some trees like the oaks like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy. there's nothing bothers them. their leaves are still green and some of the other oaks. there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves. um what i notice mostly is the red maples that the leaves are just dead the dogwoods still look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit but they still look pretty good.
A:	right. and then do it all over again. uh-huh.
B:	how many stories? just one?
A:	uh-huh yeah.
B:	i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean very antisocial. maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but
A:	it's just one story. yeah. it's a fox and jacobs home.
B:	and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old and he wants to be best friends
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh except the kid huh that's 
B:	and uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
A:	sure. yeah.
B:	really.
A:	is that in term
B:	most people are are retired or or or you know they're they're in their forties or or whatever. so and i'm in my twenties so i i'm i'm out more than they are but they're at home at night
A:	yeah.
