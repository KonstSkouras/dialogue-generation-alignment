A:	well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally
B:	it's it's amazing they either have one or none.
A:	well that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us you know about the problems. so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but they at at the t i there i said is there any area i should avoid. and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything. and she she thought for a few minutes and she said no. and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. she said no. and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
B:	right. if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say look you know this guy's got everything together.
A:	so maybe you would
B:	that's wonderful. there's a lot out there to see
A:	uh

A:	oh yeah if you if you can yeah.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh yeah. it comes and goes.
B:	so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material. then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
A:	and now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to for the last couple of years i've done it myself.
B:	it's uh pretty nice. unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
A:	yep.
B:	yep. oh
A:	yeah well you can possess 'em here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like uh the the brady bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues
B:	oh gee.
A:	yeah. we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
B:	you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there. they put themselves in that situation.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and and who's you know the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
A:	but what i think that was a a a setback. that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour. i think like
B:	and especially in the winter. i mean you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know. it's like it's like a vampire sometimes
A:	yes i live in northwest garland. right up there near the golf course.
B:	yeah.
A:	well the only uh references that i have seen lately has been uh in part of the overmilitarization of iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things and and they made references to in the past how we have given arms to uh nicaragua and to other places in latin america and that those might turn around and haunt us someday.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously
A:	uh as a course for p e you know so i could graduate.
B:	yeah there are. um i'm living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs there's a facility. and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is is uh run down there
A:	okay. what uh go ahead and tell me about your home
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	really? well that's a good deal.
B:	i sort of worked half time. i had very flexible hours. i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and i  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers.
A:	that's a good idea. we ought to yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i don't know what they're going to do. it's really not my family. it's my fiancee's so i don't i can't say much.
B:	right he's supposed to be able to do that.
A:	and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. yeah. um. well i'll tell you. sometimes it's it's pretty bad here. like today i think it was pretty bad. i don't know if it was if it's just uh the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
B:	although they've got uh meals on wheels  which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat.
A:	uh uh university of southern mississippi.
B:	well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
A:	it's not unique
B:	you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty.
A:	oh. well i tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in colorado that's you know there's snow and it's an adventure and here yeah you've just got to drive down to the to the stadium
B:	and i was disappointed when i went to texas. i didn't see that many of them.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
A:	and um my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the
B:	oh.
A:	isn't that correct.
B:	a lexus uh s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.
A:	haven't been there i keep hearing these marvelous things about deer valley and
B:	so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. uh but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that uh the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided.
A:	and and we really don't have any that don't have the social security and everything really isn't that much for elderly people to live on.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah can you believe it that's just uh
B:	yeah uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two?
A:	yeah. yeah.
B:	i would imagine that i'll uh if something happens i'll move one of them or you know in in with me.
A:	i didn't know.
B:	i can't remember which. i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got.
A:	you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often and that must be the thing. they really hadn't either. they went to the memorial you know when they go it's on business
B:	they are beautiful homes.
A:	so yeah that's why that's why england was nice. even we traveled in europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the most the places we went we went to germany and switzerland and
B:	yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility.
A:	and they came from the same litter and everything.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh yeah yeah. we did a lot of different things. we'd stop when we wanted to that kind of stuff. so we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of uh sightseeing uh different areas. uh sitting back at different areas and spending hours we never had really a time limit we just kind of did what we wanted to do for that day.
B:	yeah.
A:	um but there is starting to in minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead into the air or other pollutants
B:	yeah.
A:	unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
B:	right. right. i i it seems like they come in spurts.
A:	let's see a good dinner party menu.

B:	you know what i miss though? basements.
A:	that's uh that's
B:	okay bye.
A:	and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything. and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it. which really doesn't make sense.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah. no that's true. course they have a requirement that uh that every single appeal must be permitted.
A:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. that's great.
A:	where there's a will  where there's a will there's a way right?
B:	okay.
A:	it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is.
B:	that's major dad at eight i think it is.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	think about uh taxes.
