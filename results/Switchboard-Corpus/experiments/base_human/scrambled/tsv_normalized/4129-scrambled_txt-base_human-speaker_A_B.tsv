A:	you said you have four cats?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh but for the
B:	well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided. um by juries particularly and i know in england the judges set all of the awards. you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence but then they leave the awards up to more learned people. and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars
A:	and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh just across the board.
B:	oh how
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah. well
A:	it's a rotation.
B:	i see.
A:	yeah yeah. but it's still good. it's still uh uh you know you don't really miss anything.
B:	then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely
A:	uh i yeah i and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i i think that that's viable. um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. i think. yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right
B:	well but it then they can have them play against each other.
A:	i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess.
B:	oh oh you are?
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that and that's that's pretty good quality time with them
B:	that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
A:	oh yeah. i i i don't agree with that at all.
B:	oh uh-huh.
A:	well he's from here.
B:	well i tell you you know the the german shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in america that's called a rin tin tin phenomena.
A:	we're we're a wasteful society for sure.
B:	you know. because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or businesses are are not on the up and up all the time you know. i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of a company situation.
A:	and of course they don't have that here in texas so there's ...
B:	but the problem is  like first time i went out of here and they took me to las vegas
A:	we had about a little bit less than two weeks.
B:	are you? where are a student?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think we hope that it will be you know some sort of deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that.
A:	yeah.
B:	if you can do things together that really helps a lot.
A:	it's really really pretty. i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about mountain things. you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river
B:	it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
A:	yeah.
B:	well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it. it's uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
A:	and nope we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
B:	oh that sounds nice. i like bluegrass too.
A:	but well that's all i can really think about for recycling.
B:	yes.
A:	brian in plano texas. how are you doing today?
B:	i think i think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way.
A:	but they have i read somewhere and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh lower income brackets of the united states. have you ever heard about that one?
B:	and so based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer.
A:	was it a boy or a girl?
B:	and but
A:	and uh so when i met my husband he was watching football and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend. i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football if i didn't like football. so
B:	yeah that's really lovely. i would love to have different fruit trees. it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches. they're just delicious. and we we we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.
A:	i don't think so.
B:	i know it's it's it's getting it's been out of hand i think for a while and it just continues to get worse.
A:	but i wish that uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that.
B:	well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things.
A:	yeah.
B:	why?
A:	yeah.
B:	besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner.
A:	that's the problem i have with it in texas they think it's and all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody uh that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime  ridden
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. we did that too
B:	but uh well i got my thirty day notice yesterday.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and one of the congressmen has has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
A:	well thank you you have a good day.
B:	it's only getting worse exponentially it seems.
A:	there's uh we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. we've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
B:	but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then i don't know what i'll do up there.
A:	no in fact some of the days we froze. it was
B:	yeah.
A:	is it choice or just business or
B:	do you?
A:	oh gee.
B:	well that sounds kind of dumb.
