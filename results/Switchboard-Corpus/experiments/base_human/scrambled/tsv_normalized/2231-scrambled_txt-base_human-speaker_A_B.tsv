A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh it is to a certain extent
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom. all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
A:	yeah i know what you mean. um i in maryland they they do have capital punishment
B:	okay and and in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what?
A:	and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. so other than the vikings who do you like?
B:	it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system.
A:	yeah.
B:	it was same time period yes.
A:	that's right. everything we eat. everything everything we eat should have a label on it
B:	yeah. there's there's a race in australia with solar powered cars.
A:	okay.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
A:	yes.
B:	so it's it's a really tough question. that's right.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
A:	um.
B:	oh diving. uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. yeah right.
A:	oh
B:	yeah those are pretty good but true to life
A:	oh that's a those are beautiful.
B:	and i just you get so attached to them.
A:	well that's right. but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated. it's not nearly as important.
B:	but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
A:	yeah i mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank god
B:	uh and because the cost of living around here is so high
A:	yeah.
B:	but you're married?
A:	oh gosh. well actually i used to play in the richardson symphony i played violin in the orchestra for several years you know
B:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah that's good. well one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
B:	do you do barbecues?
A:	it's not many from the local communities.
B:	i was wondering how
A:	uh-huh. i've never done potato. we used to do it at home when i was a kid had a huge garden.
B:	that's what i thought.
A:	that's right you sure don't. at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and where are they at?
B:	like aluminum cans?
A:	oh that's interesting.
B:	but that 
A:	it's like a macy's kind of store
B:	uh-huh. yeah. do you do you kind of think it's a chore or do you enjoy it?
A:	and he's you know a lot of wisdom in it. and the kids at bible talk about anything but training and training is different than anything else in in psychology doesn't address it. a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the bible and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
B:	uh it's because i i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. so i go outside the area for that. and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state. i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer.
A:	but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state.
B:	well that and in the schools too starting to put metal detectors in
A:	uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments places in between places.
B:	yes.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	my neighbor across the street has one. he always uses it to dethatch his lawn
A:	and does that mean like flus and everything else there are all these different strains of it?
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
A:	i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that kill people and uh you know all
B:	oh that's good. oh we just uh just love them. they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's like oh your claws need trimming.
A:	you know um i i think nursing homes are are um some are good
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean actually i think that works pretty well. and that that makes
B:	right.
A:	yeah.
B:	either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	very similar yeah.
A:	uh-huh. isn't
B:	but ...
A:	um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in-depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read newsweek can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v but uh um i found out that also on on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to. um i found out though that or i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative. there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news. and it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
B:	huh.
A:	yeah.
B:	that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven
A:	so.
B:	so and and he was trying to keep uh uh i can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the vikings.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh. and what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
B:	right.
A:	yeah that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything. uh i am oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of dallas. it's a in a nice neighborhood. the houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now.
B:	huh.
A:	it kind of traveled around travel .
B:	my nine year old i've decided to teach her how to type using the computer
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	well um i have a a a former exercise program. i'm a graduate student and this semester i'll tell you what i it's been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise. um last summer i was a a swim instructor all summer and and life guard so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and um and since i worked at a recreation center i could uh you know use those facilities quite often. but um. oh yeah. oh yeah.
A:	right.
B:	but the texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil.
A:	um.
B:	you know. in that standpoint.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles the you know mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
B:	yeah well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
