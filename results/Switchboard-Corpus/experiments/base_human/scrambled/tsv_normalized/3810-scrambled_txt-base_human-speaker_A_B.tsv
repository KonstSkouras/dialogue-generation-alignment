A:	that was good, i think. and, and the other book i am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity, uh,
B:	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
A:	uh-huh. and i know when i spent, the time that i've studied in mexico, uh, spanish was one of my majors in college, that, uh, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america,
B:	and that, i know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
A:	yes, we sure do, smoke them
B:	well, we live, uh, pretty close, to the mesquite golf course.
A:	we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis and, probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process.
B:	right. i guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know.
A:	yeah, i, i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress, uh, for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now.
B:	uh-huh. huh.
A:	so i've been librarian all this week, which has been real interesting, and i'm enjoying it. i'm around my kids
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
A:	yes, that's true. orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
B:	yeah and,
A:	yeah.
B:	yes.
A:	that's, that's, uh, that's real good.
B:	that's one of my husband's pet peeves. he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
A:	yeah, i understand. i am a, i own my company. i am in the, i am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
B:	uh-huh. huh, we don't,
A:	yes. i do not like the
B:	and, uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.
A:	oh, gosh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	which one?
B:	so, we generally don't have those to do.
A:	oh, yeah.
B:	no, i'm just, uh, federal company, you know,
A:	i imagine. they usually are after something like that happens to them. it seems to mellow them or something.
B:	how many square feet do you have?
A:	i guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
B:	uh-huh. no, i,
A:	well, i like it.
B:	okay, well personally, i don't have any children. i'm twenty-two and i'm doing my master's at n c state
A:	yeah.
B:	yes.
A:	yeah, yeah.
B:	spaghetti, i guess, though. i make a mean spaghetti.
A:	so i think, you know, and, and, and the kid's certainly not making much money.
B:	well, i keep trying to get away from them, i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use, you know, a variety of the visa and the mastercard and the stores, but i think i, i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things, you know, i see it on sale and i think, oh, it's on sale i have to get it, and i really don't need it or i really haven't budgeted for it so, um, the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them at all.
A:	yeah. well, i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. but i think it's too minor and too, you know,
B:	oh, my god, the poor woman.
A:	yeah.
B:	so,
A:	well , that's, that's, um, pampering the, the petals
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	i don't know how else to explain. but, we've got friends that are in the music business that go around dallas, they're, uh, called odessa. it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and, uh, we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff, too, so we've had a lot of stuff, you know, friends and, and things to do with music that constant, plus my husband's real big into music, too, so. he doesn't play anything, but, he just likes to listen.
A:	oh, really? uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh
A:	well, these are accidental tomatos.
B:	right. yeah, my backyard is, uh, is sloping so i built a box up, you know had to build the one, the low side up.
A:	so i can see where that, that, may be a problem.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right, just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
B:	right.
A:	no, my husband does.
B:	unless there's some trend or something that says, jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever. uh, that's, that's sort of more of, of a pattern news.
A:	that's some, yeah, because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position, they, they're very comfortable, they lose the ability to learn, and they in a sense become unteachable. they think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five, and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education, and, and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
B:	yeah, i guess so. it really sounds like it was fun.
A:	yeah.
B:	he collects trash. you know, and,
A:	which is the dog and which is the cat?
B:	do they have many buildings that have security there?
A:	yeah. i am too a little bit, i mean, i, i don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,
