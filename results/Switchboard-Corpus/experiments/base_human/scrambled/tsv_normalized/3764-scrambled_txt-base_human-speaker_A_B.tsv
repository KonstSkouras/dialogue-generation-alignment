A:	i, i get a little bit nervous about it, and, uh,
B:	i think it's too easy for them.
A:	but, they're fun.
B:	that's right. and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
A:	yes, until you release it.
B:	yeah. at, at which one?
A:	wait, no, no,
B:	oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through. when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan, and, i mean, a chiropractor got it in one time
A:	yeah. well, i i know that, for instance, in the n c double a, they drug test and it's not random.
B:	i if it's good, i think it's very good for the child.
A:	we, we either crock pot deer or we'll, uh, you know, put it out on the grill so that, uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
B:	they're ...
A:	oh, i, i'd, well actually i did visit hawaii once but i never made it off of oahu, which i've heard is not the nicest of the islands.
B:	uh, yeah, unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six. it's like slow out the
A:	we tried to start that in my husband's family. his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and i said, well let's start this letter, and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. i sent it, on to the next one,
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. oh.
B:	i see.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah. well that's that's true
B:	okay, what do you feel are some of the main problems?
A:	but i
B:	uh-huh. oh, that's good.
A:	they look like, yeah, they seem like a tennis ball but it almost doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah, the best i, i don't think i could, i, i could handle those tennis balls. so, what else to you tape besides american at, there anything else?
B:	she made these onion rings that were so good,
A:	right.
B:	oh, okay
A:	well, since you live close, i don't know if you know, um, about what louisville is doing with recycling, or are you familiar with any of that?
B:	yeah, so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,
A:	have you seen those, uh, do you ever read cosmo.
B:	yeah, and she, oh baths. oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. it was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
A:	oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, and a mother isn't an important important thing as, as having a career
A:	yeah. and i think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. i mean, i don't, i think you know, people just,
B:	uh-huh. right, we feel that, you know, just spending time together. you don't necessarily have to be doing anything, you know, that costs money or, or, you know, that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that. it's just the kids like to, being together as a family.
A:	huh?
B:	really?
A:	since they've been to phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, i guess. i guess i've always been a cowboy fan. other than that, i mean, you know, when i've, you know, when you grow up in a city that has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it.
B:	what do you think?
A:	all right.
B:	no. well it's interesting. i bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.

A:	and they do it again, you know.
B:	and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like
A:	uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, that was absurd there is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
A:	did they?
B:	i think so.
A:	i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody, i mean, i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in florida, in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case
B:	i, i, give me cyanide. i mean, is it )),
