A:	i'm catholic and we're not supposed to, but, uh, i feel that it, like you, you know, on the premeditated murders i feel if you're, you know, i mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
B:	well, i, i just think that, uh, you know, at that when, when they were you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same geographical location.
A:	yeah, he makes good money too doing that, you'd be i was shocked, but anyway, someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh. okay. yeah.
B:	and i ended up getting one that, uh, came out of a, a, a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.
A:	that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	i, i don't understand it, they consider it violent. i have so ever , i have seen it on, where we are , i live in, uh , rochester, new york, and i think a,
B:	yeah,
A:	more lax?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	they're kind of rare.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and actually i'm concerned that they're not. i have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
B:	yeah.
A:	oh.
B:	remember jim hart? jim hart was playing. terry metcalf was on the cardinals. this was a long time ago.
A:	oh. really?
B:	but, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh, like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i, i'm serious. and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. with plea bargaining.
B:	well, that's, uh, i know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
A:	you've hit pretty, you've put a lot of the main points in.
B:	and we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under roger staubach . and we kind of got spoiled.
A:	but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it, just because, um, uh, it's too much pressure. you know,
B:	oh, really? why?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
A:	yes, it is. i am, uh, like a catholic and the people that go to my church, you know catholics dress very casual a lot of the times. people in jeans and in whatever, but yet the way i was raised, i am a converted catholic, the way i was raised, i was raised a baptist and like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time. i guess that has changed also.
B:	are you, uh, transit usually? i mean do you stay not in one place too long?
A:	sure.
B:	and they have one at ten.
A:	yeah. and, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat. i sat and watched him. you know the barney? you know the little, i don't know if you know the little character barney.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. how about you?
A:	and, and i just sort of think that's ridiculous.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh.
B:	so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, i'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant, you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.
A:	two.
B:	i couldn't either.
A:	which, uh, kind of taco turkey loaf. it was good. uh, scalloped potatoes.
B:	and, uh, i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
A:	and, you know, i would get hung up by my boot straps if i if i ever mentioned the ford product in my family.
B:	right. yeah, i know what you mean
A:	good.
B:	whatever i'm doing, i watch that. i usually watch the news, either at, you know, early evening or at ten o'clock
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i'm, and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.
A:	i believe it is too.
B:	yeah, that sounds like a good idea. my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government, i don't know
A:	and we caught, the individuals got caught, we, uh, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
B:	uh-huh.
A:	exactly.
B:	so, it's, uh, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, but the taxes would be, you know, perhaps, maybe one-third uh, of,
A:	it really is a small,  hostile planet
B:	uh, i guess i, i grew up on it and it's fun. it's, it's an enjoyable part of driving. i do feel like i have, uh, more control over the car
A:	i know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, i guess. uh,
