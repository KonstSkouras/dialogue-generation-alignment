A:	okay uh what kind of hobbies do you have lori?
B:	uh.
A:	yeah i'm in dallas and they're long here too.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	that's absolutely right. it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh uh granted you know that any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable.
A:	uh-huh there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah. i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.
B:	i've never been over impressed with him.
A:	yes.
B:	oh i don't know.
A:	that is for sure.
B:	oh yeah oh yeah.
A:	yeah that's good. i also i was impressed by uh by the mercedes too.
B:	i think they compare you know fairly well.
A:	so those are the real killers. if he's just gone
B:	well what what it will be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down.
A:	and uh here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh just
B:	you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich.
A:	that's right. that's right. uh-huh. uh-huh. takes a lot of room.
B:	huh stick shift huh?
A:	well you know if if they have time enough they can  stay off of it.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. but mine are twenty-two twenty-three and twenty-seven so you know that
B:	there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know and i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be
A:	and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh so we have watched that
B:	oh yes or they i agree with the freedom of the press you know and all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
A:	oh.
B:	i know they lost yeah to washington and philadelphia.
A:	well i'll keep that one in mind.
B:	yes uh-huh.
A:	yes.
B:	yeah. that's pretty good.
A:	and we got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
B:	right.
A:	kind of see what happens.
B:	really?
A:	that's true. a a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i i forgot that. there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a a loss. i i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. uh i mean i i don't know if i agree with that. but it but
B:	actually it was more fun than you would think. yeah starting from the beginning but um yeah we live also live in the city now actually in manhattan.
A:	of course uh-huh.
B:	but we did we really truly did pay a fortune. i mean we were paying at one point well about about a close about five hundred dollars a week for two children.
A:	you know what i'm saying? that we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
B:	yeah.
A:	no i haven't. have you?
B:	and it would be just
A:	uh my more exciting spots have been i've been to the galapagos islands.
B:	yeah yeah you it's it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because they have a lot more money.
A:	so that and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
B:	i've never actually never actually played it. but
A:	oh yeah.
B:	yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know
A:	uh-huh yeah i agree with you very much so. now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew time wise or and money wise too
B:	i'm uh my father had a software company
A:	yeah
B:	right. right. we froze a lot of peppers. we let some turn red.
A:	and uh  you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn.
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	um september really was i'm not sure about october. i think for about twelve months through september the the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. um lots of ninety degree days during the summer.
B:	yeah how old is she?
A:	i mean either way there was family reunion time or not
B:	that is not breed standard.
A:	yeah. it's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours if as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do . worked out really well for us too.
B:	nobody came near it when he was there.
A:	well that's good.
B:	then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
A:	and then actually after there i went to um hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
B:	sure. insurance should pay for that.
A:	and you there were some places where people
B:	uh-huh. you really aren't isolated because it's the advantages your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people
A:	uh-huh. oh that's great. long as it's not raining.
B:	oh close to five minutes i believe.
A:	yeah i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the three eighty-six. that wasn't alive for but maybe two years.
B:	so what do you guys having up there? i haven't been up there since oh lord forty-eight i guess
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	if you had to do something like that day after day.
B:	i really don't think so. yeah. i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent i i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think one of the problems with with education as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think is going to be a hard thing for for people to face.
A:	um but he had actually was able to get him over that.
B:	it is. it really is.
A:	oh yeah there's
B:	uh-huh.
A:	the recycling program here is just terrible. i mean it's hard to find places to go. i mean kroger does a couple things. they i don't think they do they do newspapers?
B:	okay he's uh uh south of renner on on custer. and there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like or strip kind of center.
A:	very comfortable so.
B:	they really are. the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog.
A:	of course not.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	well you you think it's better than to to try to spread the the effort equally among all the employees of the company or
B:	uh-huh. oh.
A:	yeah.
B:	drive cars with catalytic converters and all that. it's interesting. they're they're looking at there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electrical powered
A:	really?
B:	yeah. as far as yeah getting doctors and all that stuff yeah.
A:	you bet even back then
B:	uh-huh.
A:	no no. well life just took different turns here so uh it just didn't work out to do that now. so he's he's about ready to retire another year and he
B:	no. right.
A:	huh.
B:	you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts?
A:	um.
B:	oh uh-huh. yeah.
A:	and anyway we are not talking about that but uh gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that. just to tell me what to do with my garden and uh and uh
B:	it's it's very easy to do.
A:	isn't that a shame.
B:	so we're getting a large oh gosh i don't know i think there's like twenty-six different languages now that are spoken in i the i s d. dallas innercity school district.
A:	uh. well is there anything else that you look for or
B:	but we're not into that. we're into like have to have it all now.
A:	you know so.
B:	so you've been fairly happy with it. how long have you been in it?
A:	well i mean but you didn't have oboe or something with it?
B:	yeah.
A:	well i suppose you may be right on that. matter of fact i've heard that  i've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
B:	so.
A:	it's not the law abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun it's the ones that are going out and stealing it.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	reduce the violence in the prisons. i think that's its only purpose is is you know to reduce uh the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. off earlier.
A:	right exactly. i i don't the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management.
B:	and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
A:	huh-uh.
B:	i i don't know
A:	yeah that would be. i usually vote. a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on what issues
B:	and um it's causing quite a stir up here  because we're so close to d c anyway.
A:	yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are inconveniences to that
B:	uh-huh.
