A:	so, uh, but i, i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,
B:	i've never seen you before who are you?
A:	well, it is, it is, though.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	we don't have, i guess too much trouble in dallas with, well, i guess, i guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico, that cause problems, but, uh.
B:	oh, right, now we have a kid but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat, he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid, and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend, and,
A:	it sounds nice.
B:	oh, really, you like, uh, so you're an american
A:	i think that's a lot more realistic. uh, i, i think that we should be spending more time and, and again i don't think the, the peace corps is, is as successful now simply because it's not. it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
B:	huh.
A:	you could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	but, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know, they really didn't do it. well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.
B:	yeah.
A:	well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?
B:	bye.
A:	yes, yes.
B:	some baby-sitting groups, again, i know it sounds like a rationalization, but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they, they learn to share. they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.
A:	yeah.
B:	and we had it perfumed
A:	huh.
B:	yeah. he's about a year and a half younger.
A:	so,
B:	it was, uh, that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. in the in the presidential race. uh, may, it may not have been maryland. it may have been massachusetts, i don't remember.
A:	i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
B:	and, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.
A:	he never meows, he, he doesn't have any front claws, i had him declawed,
B:	oh, that's neat. sure.
A:	hi.
B:	well, they are, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because i had a retriever, actually i had a retriever irish setter cross. which is a really nice animal
A:	i've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one
B:	yeah. but,
A:	okay.
B:	and if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
A:	and, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
B:	and they haven't been doing too hot, so.
A:	and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags. they won't take those. we like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.
B:	we have, uh, uh, tortoise which is a black and, and orange.
A:	right.
B:	you have more of a choice, you're not pressed upon as bad.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and, so he has all the work space he needs.
A:	well, i, i don't think that it's, it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions. for instance, jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's, where there's, uh, endangerment to their own life and other people's lives.
B:	but, um, he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet.
A:	imagine the guilt that person would have. i mean  burned out.
B:	we did, i did horseback riding, too, in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses and, uh, that was kind of for them, but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, we always had horses around, and i really enjoyed that,
A:	uh-huh. i know it, i know it.
B:	okay.
A:	okay, have a good night. all right, bye-bye.
B:	so i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about, i disagree with them.
A:	yeah, you really don't. yeah, the, you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh,
