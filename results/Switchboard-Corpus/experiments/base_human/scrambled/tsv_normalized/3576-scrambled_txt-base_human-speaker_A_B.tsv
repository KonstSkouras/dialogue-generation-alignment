B:	but i don't know that there's a real uh
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything but uh i think more often than not
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah well that's how cleo you know she'd lay on her step
A:	yeah.
B:	um. ooh this is a beneficial call. i like this
A:	it's just that i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
B:	so if you look at russia and what's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing. and of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now. one of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.
A:	yeah.
B:	they on i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a uh you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of everything he he he did not he did not throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh and had ended up

B:	and so they say well this is you know i i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
A:	i think that's true.
B:	what was that?
A:	well i think it's interesting to look at uh where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
B:	no i'm not that old either
A:	and then the iranian couldn't he didn't want them so he gave them to alan and alan and his dad had plans that night so they gave them to us so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian with baseball tickets

A:	uh okay bye-bye.
B:	and so i and i wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know.
A:	yes.
B:	well i think that's true and i uh now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it.
A:	yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates
B:	uh-huh. well i had a friend that uh visited england not well i think it's been probably two years now but that's her next goal and she can do it is go back to england because she really has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it.
A:	yeah.
B:	i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know. and even in summer time sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them.
