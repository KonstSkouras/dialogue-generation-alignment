A:	oh, chris xeros.
B:	it's just north of me here.
A:	uh-huh. there was that, which was it jerry brown, one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a i think a flat percentage, something like that.
B:	uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.
A:	i do belong to a, a large corporation or my, that where i'm currently employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
B:	right.
A:	yeah, that's exactly it.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. yeah, i think she'd like to, i just don't know if it's really, knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
A:	so, it really is a different, um,
B:	yeah, i mean it's, true. yeah.
A:	yes. and that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two, so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
B:	we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids.
A:	okay, well, it was good talking to you and have a good evening.
B:	well, is the pollution really bad up there?
A:	in other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
B:	to get them on their, yeah.
A:	right.
B:	yeah, and, uh, who's the other guy, larouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, i believe.
A:	my word, it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
B:	yeah.
A:	they expect, opening it for one hour, that they'll get three, hundred thousand telephone calls.
B:	and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that. i, i tried to have, um, figured something having, so i tried to have a goldfish,
A:	and, you know, but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day, they split it
B:	uh-huh.
A:	because i don't like credit cards for one thing, you know, i mean, they're okay, i guess, if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,
B:	because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well. for the, the orthodontia stuff.
A:	yeah. we enjoy fooling around with it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?
B:	right.
A:	i mean, you know
B:	yes, what a coincidence.
A:	okay, okay.
B:	it will be.
A:	yeah.
B:	well that's the way it has gotten here.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, i, i, think, you know, i like dogs, but i think that, uh, i'm, kind of like big big dogs and you have to have room for them.
A:	so, we just say he travels a lot. so, that kind of covers it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, i am i need it, too, otherwise,
B:	nancy.
A:	huh.
B:	okay, thank you. bye-bye
A:	it, it turned out to be a, a chrysler. uh lancer.
B:	i tape it. but i understand, uh, that in england, they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent, and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program.
A:	on my father's side we've really there, uh,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. but when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side, and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.
A:	oh, just our own design.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and that, what i think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it. i mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us.
B:	wow.
A:	i think it's been on, i think i've seen it during the day.

B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. i, i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	it is and, and i don't know if it's, uh, the family, you know, thing where they're not bonding anymore, where mothers are working all the time and, the kids aren't getting the attention that they need, or the television.
A:	boy, they'll strip,
B:	no problem.
A:	right. and, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.
B:	well, i don't feel very good about it, but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do. we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore.
A:	and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap, so, when you pull the saran wrap back, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap and i might put it back on. but, um,
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yes.
A:	and, uh, that really should be in your but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
B:	uh-huh.
A:	okay they suggested that we, uh, discuss what we think of when we say camping.
B:	they don't think twice about it. yeah. either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
