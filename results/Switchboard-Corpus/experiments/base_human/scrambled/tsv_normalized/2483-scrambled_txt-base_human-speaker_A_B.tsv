A:	uh, guy was in a, uh, in a hunting club
B:	it would get snatched right off your arm
A:	exactly,
B:	and i think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh that's terrible.
A:	vision, i guess it's called, vision care.
B:	okay. well, uh, anyways, i'm not exactly sure i, i wasn't really, uh, paying attention as to what particular, uh, parts of capital punishment we're supposed to talk about, but it was, uh, basically what's your views on, whether you thought there was certain cases that should be used, that sort of thing?
A:	i keep hoping for.
B:	so. it was, uh, it was a big deal, but, uh, they tried to, to centralize it in one spot. so, in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year.
A:	where are you going studying?
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	so it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
A:	and i, i  i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.
B:	right.
A:	and somebody will turn it in and, and nothing will be missing. they said they can just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that. i thought, boy, in america, if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.
B:	and it always will be, and and i think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
A:	unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently.
B:	huh.
A:	and i'm, i'm getting much better. my stamina is getting great for the dance floor so  i mean it's just,
B:	right.
A:	um, i don't remember myself.
B:	uh-huh. so you like a, a variety.
A:	no, i don't, an my kids would love a pet. i had a pet when i was a girl. i had a cocker spaniel. and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company.
B:	oh
A:	and it was just, i mean you can go to k-mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats,
B:	yeah. yeah.
A:	you want to, yeah. they'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters and then, i think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so that will probably help out.
B:	service charge you mean?
A:	are you going up toward, uh, uh, i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an m, bradford, no that's too far north.
B:	oh, that sounds so easy, what i did,
A:	we were in colorado recently and heard this, these, uh, well, we heard this fiddler and we bought his, we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans .
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
A:	sure.
B:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
B:	do you have any pets?
A:	i think that's really true.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm, uh, dig their own wells, set up, their schools.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	huh.
B:	right, exactly. yeah.
A:	huh.
B:	yeah, we still got some from last year.
A:	oh, yes, but we try, you know, i try, my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does
B:	sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.
A:	uh, i don't know. your camping experience is probably, i don't know if they're similar to mine but, uh, since i've had children it has changed a little bit, but, uh, when my husband and i were, uh, camping, we'd take this domed tent that, uh, is easily collapsible and, uh, go camping and, uh, just kind of roughed it. as long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that, then it was fine. but, uh, we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little, uh, escapade for the day and, uh, kind of, uh, do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to. but, uh, that's kind of changed now. when you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning and you don't want them up that early.
B:	i'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a taco or something
A:	uh-huh
B:	i was in the band, yeah
A:	oh.
B:	primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i don't either that's one,
A:	oh
B:	yeah, i think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
A:	but so, i'm not quite getting the level that i need to.
B:	oh.
A:	are they.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh
B:	and, it's, it's, they're, and also they're fed up with the system, and they say, well, why should i even vote.
A:	so, it's been fun.
B:	no. really.
A:	no. i'm not real familiar with that.
B:	right. i know.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	now, the, the, and that's with, uh, you have to have, uh, oh, a police investigation, you have to,  have references,
A:	well, good luck to you, too.
B:	well those and probably the security aspect of it.
