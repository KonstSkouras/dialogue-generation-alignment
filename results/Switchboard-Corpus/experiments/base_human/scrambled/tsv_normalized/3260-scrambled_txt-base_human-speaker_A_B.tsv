A:	but, uh, even the small towns now though, has really changed from when i was a kid, but now i'm raising children. it it really is.
B:	the first sunday in october, the jordan family gets together.
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah, and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,
A:	i mean  know
B:	right.
A:	and i, um, i just refuse to buy it, um, if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.

B:	that's what my husband said, so this last year he changed it, of course, we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back and it was like oh, no. better find another way of saving money
A:	so that gives us special time together too.
B:	well, i'm like you. i don't, i don't, i like to read the paper but i basically don't do it every day, and i, um, i usually watch, uh, either good morning, america or the today show, every morning while i'm, you know,
A:	about fifteen miles. i live in a little suburb, uh, which is, i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
B:	yeah, that's, i i agree, i think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children
A:	oh, i'm sure, yeah, there, i mean, you can go down a street, and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
B:	right.
A:	huh.
B:	and then
A:	um. yeah, it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things. i think i have a severe demeanor or something.
B:	well, when you start early, i guess,
A:	and i feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. but i can't give them up.
B:	i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.

B:	yeah.
A:	okay. we don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
B:	uh-huh. right, uh, yeah, we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull.
A:	yeah.
B:	no, i don't, i think that's stupidity on parents' part. i mean that's, sex is rampant,
A:	i know they say that, that is,
B:	yeah, it must be fun to be able to play it and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, i think.
A:	when they're skiing they're fearless, and they go off,
B:	"huh-uh. *according to the following utterance, this is an affirmative answer, so should be ""uh-huh"" just my husband and i and the two dogs."

B:	really?
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah .
A:	uh, oh.
B:	but we like good uh, we're, we like mexican food.

B:	i saw the movie, and, uh,
A:	did you scuba dive there?

A:	i'd be, i mean i'd be tried by a jury of you know, people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things, and, uh, i don't know,
B:	well, it takes a little brainwashing first.
A:	if you have an, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, uh, professionals.
B:	but, uh, let's see, that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather, okay, so it would be the second great grandchild. and so they,
A:	well, i think you hit on one point there is you know each other.
B:	and it's kind of split between c m u and,  and, you know, the employee.
A:	okay. um, well, i like to cook, um
B:	they hold competitions in los angeles in, um, florida and minneapolis, um, trying to think of, i think it's in four places around the united states. they hold competition and the only requirement is, of course, your skill of passing these tests,
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	yeah
A:	that's funny.
B:	take a twenty-two and find a creek.

A:	yeah.
B:	and she has to be tested periodically. and, and those are expensive tests.
A:	so if they would come up, curbside recycling,
B:	that's what, that's what people face with that choice. one thing i really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know, they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know,
A:	uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
