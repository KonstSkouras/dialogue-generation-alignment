A:	wow.
B:	yeah yeah. well to some extent if they would do something with some of those people. but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
A:	yes yes.
B:	like last saturday we went had some errands to run and so we took the kids and and went by the farmers market down in in down there in garland.
A:	my mother well she's like seventy-four now. she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both and uh
B:	i i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas.
A:	got out a lot of aggression. i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and uh i felt really good. i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. now when i do those things they're boring. i would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
B:	the kids they are real people and they are interesting and they they have all their own activities and um i think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah. it it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.
A:	well if you're looking for a nice uh-huh. well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. it's a special occasion type thing.
B:	we do
A:	and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. and so we we didn't really have enough time.
B:	so it's it's really sad
A:	oh that's good.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	right. no.
B:	uh.
A:	uh-huh. yes they are.
B:	so i wasn't sure when to start her. i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
A:	uh-huh. right.
B:	pardon me?
A:	and spanish is  pretty close to english really.
B:	and all the civil rights people are up arms about it you know.
A:	i think i i now i think people generally volunteer.

B:	i think that i would like to if you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted i would either buy a nissan maxima uh
A:	um.
B:	uh-huh. well i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job.

B:	here you break in and you're going to get shot.
A:	that's right.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. yeah. oh wow. we like the stuff that glitters
A:	that's what i hear.
B:	so i'm not sure that we'll be able to do get too many other programs for it.
A:	yeah. i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people. usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but  the the places like presbyterian village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting.
B:	he
A:	yeah. it also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting.
B:	you know but i wasn't i had forgotten or i probably wouldn't have been there.
A:	so where was your last vacation?
B:	i think i think it would be fair.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. sure

B:	right. college credit is a good idea because
A:	he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. so it's not very practical
B:	oh yeah.
A:	so
B:	uh there was certainly nothing like a a bathroom a shower or anything near by it was dig your own hole and uh  and i i'm not sure i'd do that  that anymore
A:	it is hard. it's uh like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
B:	uh but
A:	oh.
B:	and so i learned that on there too that was
A:	and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government. like one eight hundred capitol or something like that. you know just a number you could call from anywhere anytime.
B:	huh.
A:	oh yeah. i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that. but um i guess it's because i'm older i mean i'm not real old but i am older and um you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything. i guess it was because well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't.
B:	have you been uh struggling along those lines?
A:	right research triangle and all of that.
B:	yeah. right.
A:	uh-huh you'd just do it.
B:	and if if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	right. that's right.
A:	and peter strauss had played the lead role and the man and and at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh that's nice.

A:	yeah.
B:	how did how did they get involved in that?
A:	yeah.
B:	yeah uh that makes a difference doesn't it?
A:	we have got about uh twenty i'd say about twenty-four hundred.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	yes yes. and then i'll have just like  uh department stores. they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to. they'll send me any credit card i tear it up. i just can't see it.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	oh dear.
B:	the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. they have some british comedy that we've we've really liked
