A:	and how they would expect how they would hope
B:	uh not if it's done fairly. and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly.
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
B:	yeah they um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them but the glands had been removed
A:	oh.
B:	and when the cowboys won the superbowl here of course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.
A:	can bring them in.
B:	uh books i've actually i am reading a couple of different books uh one is uh a story well it is not a story it is a collection of uh of memos supposedly written by howard hughes uh
A:	but yeah. but it that's uh that's what i mean see but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response. i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just aren't you know
B:	and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
A:	right.
B:	yeah. and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.
A:	oh i hear  yes that's true.
B:	is that right? i'll heard there was some stuff on the on the radio that was equivalent to c n n.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	eighty percent of the public according to bill moyers' uh recent uh piece for uh public broadcasting which by the way is a very good use of government money. i think p b s is wonderful. but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline. and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve. that's not a formula for a better society.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually. i mean i know it it it's tricky because i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well i'm too busy to serve on a jury
B:	i do too. i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that. and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know helping helping out. i think that's good and
A:	yeah. you know i read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that i was just praying that that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite some time. and you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to a metco  you know which is a real pain.
B:	and we go along and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can.
A:	and the so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
B:	that's one of those things i got famous for in college. people would come and say could would you come over and make lasagna for me
A:	oh yeah.
B:	but you know escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales.
A:	oh huh.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	huh. uh-huh.
B:	yes.
A:	sure.
B:	oh i'm i'm a dog person. i had i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right?
A:	well in the winter time i can see see another guy but you know he's
B:	make sure we get our cash flow.
A:	that's sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats.
B:	what what is do you have a favorite recipe?
A:	but it but again it depends on what job you're in.
B:	that's awful
A:	he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire. and he has it i well it's five seventy here i'm trying to it's on cliff i don't know what the he's on all stations. you might remember the name bruce williams and he he is again national and talks about a lot of financial things. but the here i just get a kick out of uh well we do a lot of gardening here so there's we have an excellent gardener here has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday. of course that's not exactly current events. but i i'm i am kind of a radio buff.
B:	uh father's. my mother's father's family had quite a few uh brothers and sisters.
A:	uh-huh it sure would. it would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think.
B:	we've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we're living in.
A:	well not the rain so much as the cool the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like close seventy-nine or eighty
B:	what about you?
A:	well i really do i think you have to budget those things though.
B:	yes i think most states do have capital punishment. yes. but i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do.
A:	i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
B:	yeah it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months.
A:	i did too and you have a good day.
B:	you know it's so exciting.
A:	uh-huh. that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in yeah
B:	right absolutely.
A:	exactly. we saw yes you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that. so.
B:	yeah. probably that's true. but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried
A:	yeah. yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too.
B:	not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but some of the old older ones that
A:	well no would they no.
B:	oh really.
A:	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over
B:	i mean they go right back where they came from.
A:	yeah. that's right.
B:	oh well they they come out with a lot of bruises too.
A:	i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was. oh i don't even remember what it was now.
B:	that's the only way i could really
A:	so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen.
B:	yeah she's the oldest. and she well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also.
A:	yeah well i i i don't know i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because uh you know there's the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get you know
B:	yes it is. uh unfortunately i need all of it.
A:	but you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
B:	oh.
A:	oh yeah it's been it's been it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
B:	we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and uh yummy.
A:	uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations i've ever had.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and you and you you know the
B:	yeah i housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis
A:	and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you you know this is nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a i might be too cold too but they flip a switch
B:	oh really? i didn't know that.
A:	yeah. and again i don't i mean got know the you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school.  you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
B:	oh
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	huh.
B:	and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be. so i think people feel less of a desire to really go. i know that
A:	that  um i wonder sometimes
B:	right. when you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned.
A:	course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
B:	yeah i got to take care of a friend of mine's dog. he's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it was go over there and clean up after the dog
A:	uh-huh.
B:	because i think there're so many parts of the district where it's not very safe to get out and walk.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	you can see that horrible horrible brown haze.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	oh. it wasn't actually. it when we were in oahu uh i couldn't wait to get off we we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice kauai was nice and maui was nice. we had we had a great time.
A:	yeah.
B:	a lot of our words are the same
A:	yeah.
B:	you too.
A:	we'll see.
B:	oh. oh good.
A:	so i found this one and uh actually it was on a sign at taco bell drive-thru that said free kittens.
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh what kind of what kind of work do you do?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know there's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that  which aren't the i i don't consider to be the kind of crime uh  weapon you know
A:	oh yeah?
B:	uh-huh.
A:	and i worked in a very rural school district and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class
B:	they treat it with chemicals or something? why can't trees break down? i don't get it.
A:	uh-huh. well they they just don't do that any more.
B:	oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately. because they weren't in season
B:	and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house.
