A:	well i have a friend who's the same way and anything below sixty she's just not happy but i i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as uh my husband's from nebraska and they have more of the four seasons.
B:	um.
A:	but um some of these people are just out and out brutal. i some of the cases i've heard about over the years
B:	did it change anything for you?
A:	uh-huh.
B:	and what do you have.
A:	yeah.
B:	it was just strange.
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	yes we've got about five of those. i love them.
B:	it has to be something that's voluntary. you know which is pretty much the way it is now. they might
A:	oh well that's okay um
B:	and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool. but all of a sudden in in uh in october uh september october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time. and uh then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know. there were flash floods everywhere that kind of deal and then uh into of november the first like the second week uh you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze
A:	everything has sugar in it . i mean if you go your ketchup has sugar in it.
B:	uh and i planted potatoes too.
A:	it's here now we have to keep it. yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely.
B:	and it it it it sits right at the limit
A:	um.
B:	yeah.
A:	oh i can camp just about most anyway camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up
B:	yeah we've heard them and liked liked it real well of course
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh yeah. uh i um i used to uh i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds and now i weigh only about one about one seventy-five. um so i drastically had to change the way i ate when i when i first moved to college and uh i had started weight lifting quite regularly and so i got my weight down and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now because uh you know when i'm not fat like i used to be  i don't worry about it
A:	but it's uncomfortable
B:	but um they're kind of old older
A:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.

A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
B:	well i can tell you that the mets opened i think two days ago

B:	and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is uh if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship. and they lose their constitutional rights. you know
A:	uh-huh.
B:	i kind of like to read different stuff and uh i like to read a novel every now and then but uh i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
A:	and they are um of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on medicare and medicaid i mean the  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in
B:	we could go around and boy and
A:	now we haven't watched any of those.
B:	um kalachandji's. it's uh it's a hari krishna run restaurant.
A:	i
B:	only in america is there a dog called a german shepherd.
A:	i think yes.
B:	and i i think there's an attempt to do that. you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know.
A:	well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team. but i don't know.
B:	oh uh-huh.

A:	yeah that's good.
B:	oh.
A:	yeah.
B:	and unfortunately the the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.
A:	i guess i'm i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored. i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long. my parents i guess however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back. i will this year anyway from a
