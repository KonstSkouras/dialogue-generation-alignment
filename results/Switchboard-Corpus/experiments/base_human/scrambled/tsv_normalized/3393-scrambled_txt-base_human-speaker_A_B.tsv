B:	ten, i was just in the middle of watching it.
A:	i know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
B:	and keep it clean. i think that's i pretty good idea. and i think, you know, again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older. i know i did, you know, in girl scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
A:	yeah.
B:	do you know what that is?
A:	well i guess that will be it then and,
B:	and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice, they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,

B:	because,
A:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
B:	um, yeah, i've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the republican party. and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots, but, uh, my mind has gone blank. i've been all evening how they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for

A:	really.
B:	yeah, it's very, very generic.
