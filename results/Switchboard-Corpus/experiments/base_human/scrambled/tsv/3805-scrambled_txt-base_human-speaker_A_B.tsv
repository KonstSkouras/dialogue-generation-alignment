A:	Yeah. Really.
B:	A lot of them had to have elected not to do so. Now I don't know, what they do in place of it. You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something, I I don't know how they handle it I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
A:	Oh, yeah. That's good. Actually,
B:	And she's so ugly.
A:	and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.
B:	it was litter trained
A:	Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
B:	Oh, wow, I bet.
A:	and so, but, uh, she got over it, so.
B:	and I, there was just, you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything, and they got it finally semifixed, but it was such a hassle
A:	Yeah, ours is on,
B:	Right. The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
A:	Oh, good.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right, right,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. I agree with that.
B:	Oh, gosh, I do not, I do not really have a list, cause I just kind of, uh, I just have all the books out, you know, I have book shelves and I have them all out and usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, uh, uh, uh, look, look through, uh, I have one now and I, I can not remember the name of it that I, that I got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or, or Christmas or something will send me another, another good book and, uh, uh,
A:	Uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
B:	My, my, just a couple.
A:	So what type, Simply Red, I've never heard of that. Is it just instrumental?
B:	and I, and she moves it around ever other day.
A:	um, it's really, I mean, and, and it's hard to sell the properties. People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
B:	and we've been here for several years, and we've been here years when it's been hundreds and,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	No.
A:	Well, I think it's a very, very complicated,
B:	Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business.
A:	Thanks I've got the phones for lunch hour.
B:	I got to wait for a place to, to, to free up.
A:	And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great. And we started taking them up there. And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know I didn't know. And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.
B:	We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member, and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone. And it keeps the family alive,  even, you know, even though it's very fluid.
A:	It's pretty soon.
B:	I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or ...
A:	so I sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,
B:	Yeah.  larger computer ones.
A:	and I was thinking how many other people
B:	Yes.
A:	and we start out with EVENING SHADE and MAJOR DAD,
B:	Uh-huh. Right. Right.
A:	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	That's how bad it, I know.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Flooding anywhere. I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, but, uh, no, I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
