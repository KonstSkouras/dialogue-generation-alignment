B:	Yeah. And I'm also I mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that.

A:	Uh-huh.
B:	It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was and now, she's stuck with it.

Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. So I, I, and it's building up, you know, they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Right. Well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.

A:	Uh-huh. See, yeah, okay, well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind, okay, uh, we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
