A:	You owe it to yourself
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, Japan's ridiculous.
B:	Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.
A:	I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, but he does.
B:	That's, I agree with that completely. I know we don't have enough prisons, but there has got to be some kind of punishment, For these people.
A:	Okay.
B:	Okay, what kind of puppy you got?
A:	No I don't know I guess the symbolism oh I think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.
B:	and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.
A:	How about your family?
B:	Yes, we, uh, uh, I haven't missed a one since I've been eligible to vote.
A:	but now that she has one, she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit,
B:	Tell you what, I'm losing you.
A:	Um, I don't, I am only twenty-eight and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes. I don't, I have never visited any of them and, uh, I don't think I've ever even been in one. Have you?
B:	Right. Right.
A:	Oh, wow.
B:	Let's see , I had a pet rat, for a while, and it was a live rat, and, um, this woman just offered it to me while I was in, in graduate school and, she was actually a very fun pet.
A:	Oh, yes, I sure do.
B:	I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. They get too boring.
A:	And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system. So what, what,
B:	And, you know, you just see those kids going down the road. Now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment, but some of them have already been in youth centers. And that kind of thing,
A:	And so why do you like stick shift?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's great. Well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life, so Might as well start now, huh?
B:	and,
A:	And if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.
B:	So,
A:	Yeah, I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
B:	just set it up and get out of, get out of the city for awhile.
A:	and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It,
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
A:	and especially, uh, in Wisconsin and Michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
B:	Yeah, I think it's, it's somewhat a, uh, symptom of our, me generation and that, we think we need all these things and I think my parents always, you know, did without or saved up to, you know, buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have, you know, like when I first got my apartment and I was setting it up I did try to economize some but, you know, I was just like, well, I have to have it all furnished and I have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't, you know, do without too much and, you know, that's how I got started kind of with setting up a household all up, you know, it kind of like, in the short amount of time. You know, you just have to have these things just, you know, have them at home, have to have them at my own place and that's, you know, a big expenditure to start, um, buying all these things that you think or, or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place,  you know, going in one big swoop, save up and then buy it.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
B:	Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government, and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes,
A:	because you know That's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing, you know
B:	Really.
A:	His grandmother too and they're, that her son, his uncle, whatever, you know, anyway. He, he has, he's recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and, and all the other children are working or whatever.
B:	Inconvenient, even
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	You mean, really trying to plant something? That's what you're saying?
A:	I know that's how I am about Xanadu.
B:	public employees make great salaries around here
A:	And with all the, see I've got, on the south side is all glass. Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
B:	Right and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.
A:	Oh, that's right, I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.
B:	Yeah.
A:	have a good weekend.
B:	I never felt spoiled. In fact I always thought my toys were destroyed
A:	Recently graduated from high school. Meaning like, uh, you know, three or four years ago. I'm a senior in, in, uh, college now.
B:	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
A:	all, always right, right before the news is when I catch them. I, I tend to, if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news, and or, or NIGHTLINE or something, just sort of get a good, you know, a good, a good think for the day.
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, we have,
A:	Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Problem, uh-huh
B:	I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on. I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	If it's metal, it's all out of metal. It's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff.
A:	And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
B:	Well, for, I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama. So whenever I think of family reunions, my family, like, got together almost every week.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	Well, I do think with working parents it is, I mean, there are some real issues here. Um,  that I think, um,
A:	Yeah, yeah, that's true.
B:	And, I mean, it sounds horrible. It, I hear myself saying this, and, but, I, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, and how about, how about like on the weekends. Do you do sports or do you go out?
A:	Right, right.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Oh. Uh-huh, wonderful.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Yeah, they just had the baby's christening so,
A:	Ugh!
B:	you just like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know, I mean, that is just terrible.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, it's, it really is but, and she, she drives us
A:	Yeah.
B:	Wow. You better believe it, if, you wouldn't even have to leave it, I mean,
A:	Oh, that's neat.
B:	Sure did.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	New York.
A:	I think so, and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.
B:	But now that my, my, uh, youngest sister's at B Y U now, and so they have no one at home, she's back teaching school full time now, again. So if, you know, it's not, it's just a temporary thing.
A:	What type of job do you have?
B:	Something,
A:	My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
B:	and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.
A:	And the Moody Blues, and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot, and Willie Nelson.
B:	And it's, it's fun, in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.
A:	Oh, oh, yes, we start here at, uh, five.
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
A:	Yes, we snow ski. We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon,
B:	Well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?
A:	and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was very different it was a whole,  different view. It's really, um, this has opened my eyes to thinking, you know, at one time I just sat here and thought, well, how can anybody believe that because I'd really never met people that did, and now, I talk to people that do. So that's, it's really interesting.
B:	Well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him
A:	Yes. Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting? Do you think that would be, acceptable?
B:	Ooh.
A:	Uh-huh, and that costs money, yeah.
B:	That's it, we don't take care of them, we don't support them, nothing,
A:	Oh definitely.
B:	Uh-huh Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands. I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh, and I needed air-conditioning and, uh, can't remember what my, oh, I wanted uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
B:	and that was we bought a station wagon. We wanted an economical car to operate,
A:	So.
B:	uh, yeah. I, actually, I like the anti-lock brakes.
A:	today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented,
B:	Really?
A:	I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then, again, I don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
B:	And they're very dedicated to that, and, uh, it's been really wonderful. It helps you hang onto your roots.
A:	Yeah. Is it, like water running and she is doing I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things. I don't know how I would feel about it. But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
B:	Have a good
A:	It's kind of fun. And everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to, help the earth, I guess.
B:	And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no interest, no repayment schedule.
A:	I have, so I have to take that into consideration when I evaluate like how much I get paid you know, because if I was working somewhere else I'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,  or so.
B:	So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.
