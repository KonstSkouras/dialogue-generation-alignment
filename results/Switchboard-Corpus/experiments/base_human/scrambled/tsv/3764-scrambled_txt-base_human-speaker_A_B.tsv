A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes. I, I can't, I can't envision spending that much money, and on, on something along those lines.
A:	And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
B:	Oh, they, they are the best.
A:	Yeah, I've, I've heard that, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,
A:	I, I get a little bit nervous about it, and, uh,
B:	I think it's too easy for them.
A:	But, they're fun.
B:	That's right. And people don't want to give it up but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
A:	Yes, until you release it.
B:	Yeah. At, at which one?
A:	Wait, no, no,
B:	Oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through. When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, and, I mean, a chiropractor got it in one time
A:	Yeah. Well, I I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test and it's not random.
B:	I if it's good, I think it's very good for the child.
A:	We, we either crock pot deer or we'll, uh, you know, put it out on the grill so that, uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
B:	They're ...
A:	Oh, I, I'd, well actually I did visit Hawaii once but I never made it off of Oahu, which I've heard is not the nicest of the islands.
B:	Uh, yeah, unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six. It's like slow out the
A:	We tried to start that in my husband's family. His mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and I said, well let's start this letter, and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. I sent it, on to the next one,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Oh.
B:	I see.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Well that's that's true
B:	Okay, what do you feel are some of the main problems?
A:	But I
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, that's good.
A:	They look like, Yeah, they seem like a tennis ball but it almost doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah, the best I, I don't think I could, I, I could handle those tennis balls. So, what else to you tape besides AMERICAN at, there anything else?
B:	She made these onion rings that were so good,
A:	Right.
B:	Oh, okay
A:	Well, since you live close, I don't know if you know, um, about what Louisville is doing with recycling, or are you familiar with any of that?
B:	Yeah, so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,
A:	Have you seen those, uh, do you ever read COSMO.
B:	Yeah, and she, oh baths. Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	and, and a mother isn't an important important thing as, as having a career
A:	Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,
B:	Uh-huh. Right, we feel that, you know, just spending time together. You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, you know, that costs money or, or, you know, that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that. It's just the kids like to, being together as a family.
A:	Huh?
B:	Really?
A:	Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, I guess. I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan. Other than that, I mean, you know, when I've, you know, when you grow up in a city that has the, you know, one of the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get caught up in it.
B:	What do you think?
A:	All right.
B:	No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.
A:	Do you listen Do you listen to W R R?
B:	Uh,
A:	Um, so,
B:	And it's eating us alive budget wise and, uh,
A:	Uh-huh. Well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
B:	Uh-huh, and there's and there's no jarring on the.
A:	and they do it again, you know.
B:	and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, uh, that was absurd There is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
A:	Did they?
B:	I think so.
A:	I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
B:	I, I, give me cyanide. I mean, is it )),
A:	And I would never do it. I I love this country too much, and that symbol means a lot to me.
B:	It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um, yeah
A:	Wow.
B:	Yeah. It went well, it was a change, you know, from your traditional, normal, you know, stuff, and since it was Christmas time and, and, uh, we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and, you know, stuff like that and so, we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols,
