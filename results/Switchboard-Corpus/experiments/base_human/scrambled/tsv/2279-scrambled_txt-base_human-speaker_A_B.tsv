A:	Yeah, but I mean, in, here it's, uh, to the point where they were letting prisoners go. Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser crimes,  in order to put more people in, into the jails.
B:	Huh?
A:	It's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
B:	Oh, they do great. I put mine in probably in November.
A:	Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
B:	Oh. Uh-huh.
A:	so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say.
B:	you know, the poor trees, said what
A:	So.
B:	No one would want the job
A:	that's just not realistic.
B:	Yeah, uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, same with drunk drivers.
A:	But, that's been, it's been fun, I mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun, it's been fun, I feel like I've learned a lot about the piano. I've learned a lot about playing the piano.
B:	Years, uh-huh.
A:	but, um, I don't know do you like, I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
B:	It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess
A:	Oh.
B:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, uh , I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,
B:	but here again I go back to the second amendment You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.
A:	This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.
B:	Okay. Uh, right now we're living in, well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys. And, uh, right now we're in a, uh, I guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home. Which you might call it.
A:	I hope so.
B:	Yeah, I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
A:	That's right. Yeah. That's a real waste too. It really is.
B:	Oh.
A:	Okay, uh, do you work outside the home?
B:	Yeah, I read that, too. I got it, uh, right, after it came out. My, uh, you know,
A:	And they had, I was just thinking about one the other day. Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, um, but they did the Johnny Angel. They did Johnny Elway to that.
B:	And progressive tax, I think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money, and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.
A:	I, I wasn't helping them. I worked with them, not to help them, but for my own purposes. I'm, I'm a linguist and I was, uh, doing a language, trying to learn their language, a little bit. And I actually, um, I mean, helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me. But I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
B:	Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line
A:	It's an accusation, and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.
B:	yeah. So what do you do up there?
A:	Yeah. Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
B:	But it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.
A:	No, I've done some walking with friends in the past.
B:	They certainly enjoy that part of it It's just trying to keep anything. I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off, and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
A:	Yes, our first and he just turned three months.
B:	And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us, it seems to come in cycles.
A:	Uh-huh. Applied at all.
B:	Well, the good stuff. Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Now, um,
B:	Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.
A:	and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Hello Ann.
B:	Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
A:	Yeah, he sure did.
B:	and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps, so
A:	Yeah. What did they name him?
B:	Well.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about.
B:	Uh-huh
A:	and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want, and then you just.
B:	No.
A:	Is it in the phone book?
B:	Oh, well my favorite, well, I, I don't really have a favorite, I, I like everything basically. Um, I guess if I had to pick, it would be like pop, I would think, but I like everything. So, it's kind of hard to choose sometimes.
A:	Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your garbage can. Uh, you can put out newspaper, you can put out glass, you can put out aluminum cans, you can put, put out certain types of plastic material and that is on a roll out effort right now. Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, uh, participate right now, but, uh, that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so. And those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum. And I think, uh, overall that's an, an excellent opportunity because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, uh, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today, but for the future also. So,
B:	Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, but we've had her now for about three years,
A:	Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, you do then.
B:	All set. Do you want to start?
A:	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
B:	I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
A:	when they're decreasing some of the military spending, some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps
B:	You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here, and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it, but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.
A:	Oh.
B:	And some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas. And, and chops them up in recipes and things like that.
A:	I just don't hear much about it anymore. Like I say, I don't even know what programs are, are even ongoing now, you know.
B:	Right, traumatized for life here.
A:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts.
A:	See, that's we've we had a problem with that.
B:	and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of California revoked the law in the early seventies, and then they reinstated it later, but the penalty didn't go back. You know?
A:	I read my newspaper. I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper  to get here, you know.
B:	Well, yeah, that.
A:	I know that when I was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was, it was really hard on our family because I would, he would come home and I would leave,
B:	That's from the child's standpoint. The child is going, why don't you want to be close to me and your other family.
A:	Yeah. Yeah,
B:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,
B:	Yeah, I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh, I did some typing for my father when he had the company
A:	Oh it's tough, it really is.
B:	Right
A:	Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.
B:	Yes, yes. I agree.
A:	Two living areas. We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn and,
A:	And, um, so, and we're on the colder side, they're on the rainy side, we're on the snowy side and, um, we, we ski. My, my children all ski
B:	I'm for it in  in some cases.
A:	Okay. How many kids do you have?
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
A:	Yeah. We have some of them around here. You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.
B:	No, in fact, in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal.
A:	I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it
B:	I, I couldn't handle that
A:	Right, right.
B:	And, and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,
A:	So, so I guess our vote is no
B:	I think two.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I definitely think they should be tested. And I'm not, I'm not opposed to any testing. I mean because I know I certainly wouldn't want to, to, uh, you know, be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or, or you know, because he was on drugs while he was there.
A:	and so I kind of stay
B:	I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
A:	Okay. Do you have any pets?
B:	Yeah. Unfortunately.
A:	Wow, that's large
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway. That's his, that's his,
B:	Uh, Grapevine, do you know Grapevine?
A:	and he goes out and commits it again. Fact, he's back in jail now. So, what, what, uh,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Okay, it does sound like you have some children to take care of
B:	Well, my dad wants me to go back. So.
A:	Substitute. My, my, yeah,
B:	And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?
A:	No, I know when, um, we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,
B:	Uh, for the, and so, you, on that it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described as your house and what I would describe as my house say, for example, in Pensacola, Florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
A:	Yeah. That's good, that's good.
B:	Thanks. Bye-bye.
A:	they they can't do anything, so I've never, I think we had fish when I was a kid but I don't,
B:	Yes. We've, my, uh, well, when we first got married, my wife worked for a year. Then we decided to have kids.
A:	That'd probably be pretty interesting. I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. They had summonsed eight hundred people, about four hundred showed up, and it was for a murder trial.
B:	I think it would be really. really great.
A:	My husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation. She'll let something slip and we'll say, wait a minute. And, and that's it, she, just, well I didn't want to bother you. She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
B:	So we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.
A:	Yeah, that's . But,
B:	That's a whole other topic to begin with too but. Yeah, but it's, you are right. I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important.
B:	I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
