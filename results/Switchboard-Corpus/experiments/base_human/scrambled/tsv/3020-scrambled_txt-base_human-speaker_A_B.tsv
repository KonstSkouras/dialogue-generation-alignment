A:	Yeah. Yeah. And that's what I think they're saying too.
B:	Yes, they're only, I was reading something about it the other day, I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.
A:	Yeah. I guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
B:	I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
A:	and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around. So.
B:	Right. Well, it's, it's a beautiful city.
A:	And, uh, I would go out and call on farmers and I would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that, but I was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
B:	I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
A:	I really hope they do that in Louisville. It would make it a lot easier on all of us. Talk to you later.
B:	And I don't, I think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not.
A:	and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.
B:	Oh no, I understand, we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours, we've had, you know, they've been ill, I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,
A:	Do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? On a regular basis, not just Christmas cards.
B:	That'd be the best way to be.
A:	I've done a little, a lot of different kinds, but I, I just know right now that I couldn't have put out half of what I did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great. And, uh, I'm, so I'm real spoiled.
B:	And then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything, you're always just paying bills, paying bills, you know, you don't feel that you have any extra to save. And I hate, I hate living paycheck to paycheck. I like to have a little there, you know, that I can, save so I can feel that, you know, if something comes up I've got the money to pay for it, .
A:	Okay.
B:	No, no, no, no, no. Just by itself, just by itself.
A:	I, I'm a diver and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, so, uh, what are your favorite T V shows?
B:	Yeah, haven't either.
A:	Oh, she's about four. She's not completely pure. We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy. She looks like a she looks just like a Golden Retriever, but she's a little bit smaller. She's like fifty-five pounds.
B:	Yeah, I like a lot, like, I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the, I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection.
A:	We spent too much money,  until our children went to college, so. So, tell me about,
B:	And we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all, but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing something, you know.
A:	Right. Maybe next year they'll do better.
B:	No kidding. what, what, did you just decide to go there or,
A:	See, I never, I, I tell you sometimes I worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
B:	Huh-uh.
A:	Well, and one of the things I'd, and I'm with you that I don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	It piles up.
B:	Yeah, and it, I, I couldn't see having fish like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay,
A:	I think that discourages a lot of people.
B:	Yeah, well it wasn't the matter of wealth, it was the matter that they were not wealthy, that made them equal.
A:	I think it, I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on. But anyway, they're trying to keep him, you know, keep him, uh, from reinjuring anything, but anyway
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true.
A:	but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here, I like the sports, I play a lot of racquetball.
B:	and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh, you don't know Hebert Laws, but Hebert Laws a flute player, he's a jazz flute player and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione, do you know who Chuck Mangione is?
A:	Uh-huh. Right and,
B:	You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,
A:	And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
B:	Well, I'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because I lived up in Boston for a while,
A:	Okay Uh, I just currently quit my job and so I really don't receive any benefits right now
B:	Well flower gardens. I like to have, matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. So, those ought to be coming up around spring time
A:	Yeah, yeah, well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.
B:	So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
A:	That, that makes logic ,
B:	Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle
A:	Oh, yeah. I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
B:	Uh, they're, yeah, I suppose they are now. We, both of our children who live there have just bought a home. Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area.
A:	The rest of it is just like wild flowers
B:	Um, well, see, I'm a school principal.
A:	Yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back. If you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.
B:	Right. Yeah, and it's also, right now it's, uh, the, like everywhere else, uh, here in Pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly.
A:	Oh, yes, yes, yes.
B:	Huh. Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.
A:	Uh, I'm a research engineer, I work, uh, with Georgia Tech.
B:	My mother has dogs and I'm like, no.
A:	And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano.
B:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, really? Oh. You really rough it then.
B:	So don't say she's small, just say she's perfect.
A:	Well, no that's my other phone.
B:	Sure.
A:	That's right. That's right. It's really nice.
B:	Oh, yeah, my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me
A:	so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed
B:	Oh.
A:	Great.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	We, it is snowing right now. We're to get one to three inches tonight.
B:	Yeah, right, uh-huh.
A:	that's hard to say. Uh, so, it's, it's, uh, you know, saying, well, look we don't like the way he looks and, let's, uh, let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff.
B:	I love gardens that are well tended, and I just, there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers, and just, I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long. And, uh, I, I was in England once, and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it. You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
A:	But he refuses to consider any other, I don't,
B:	I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. So but,
A:	Oh, I can imagine, what did he shoot him with.
B:	Uh-huh. Things that make the, yeah. Make them more self-supporting?
A:	How do you usually cook your deer?
B:	Yeah. Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.
A:	Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.
B:	they have, um, the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to, keep them, yeah, keep them clean
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, just not, I have a younger daughter now and, uh, I, it's kind of hard to get her, get her there, and everything.
A:	No, we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
B:	Oh, okay.
A:	Oh.
B:	Good-bye.
A:	Well, that, that's an excellent, so actually that is a benefit, uh,
B:	Um.
A:	Really?
B:	that's fantastic. Yeah
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's pretty easy substituting isn't it?
A:	And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves. Um,
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
B:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh. The Really? Okay.
B:	so. I named her Rosebud, and, uh, a friend of mine said, she, that she this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years
A:	Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and some, some of them did quit the company.
B:	And everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin. And it was known as a German shepherd here. So they created a breed standard. The American Kennel Club did.
A:	And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
B:	Oh, I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this.
A:	Yeah, well being in, in Baltimore see, Maryland is, um, is sort of, um, is as, as a hub of liberalism  you know, compared to the country, uh, you know, very, uh, in, in many ways, uh, very liberal very somewhat to New England though Pennsylvania and New York, uh, I, aren't actually as liberal, Maryland is a very liberal, uh, state so, so, where here we have, um, we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that, you know.
B:	Oh, well, what's there to say? Doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion. Seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that I don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody.
A:	we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly. There were some people at the next table who spoke English, so we elicited their aid for a while
B:	and, see, I'm afraid I think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that, I mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
A:	Right.
B:	But we like our area. It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	But there's a,
B:	What about like those grocery bags?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
A:	Wow. And where was that at, near your,
B:	How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community? Is,
A:	My wife and I, you know, as mentioned, the question was, uh, do you get it from people too. And, and, I can say the same thing you do that, uh, my wife is, uh, she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and say, you didn't read the, uh, well, I always read the sports, uh, what am I thinking of, uh, the commentaries, I can't even think of what it is offhand, and she's always reading something, and she says, why haven't you read that. And, I say, I never have time to read it like you do. But, I always get a lot of my information from the, newspaper through her.
B:	its reliability.
A:	Yeah, I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea, but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
B:	Yeah.
A:	I would not imagine that.
B:	Yes Yes. Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh. is that how you heard about this thing?
B:	It kind of crept in and,
A:	Yeah, yeah, and it gives you a, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it, and it seems like ...
