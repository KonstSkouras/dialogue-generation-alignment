A:	and, uh.
B:	Sure.
A:	Yes. Yes, yes. I just, I love that, all those, that two hours
B:	and I'm just really not interested in all that.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh, so,
A:	Okay , you get it from people then.
B:	Yeah, it sounds pretty good That sounds good. I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff, and I think that's pretty neat. They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over
A:	not, not even the news but do they have like, um, do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth, start at seven o'clock? You, so, like, you know, the regular television shows that are, that are very popular, do they start at, seven or, or at eight?
B:	That's what the Utah and the large family.
A:	Uh, I've, I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society, uh, there's very little full employment. Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off.
B:	We, we found that in Jamaica. It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that
A:	Yeah.
B:	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
A:	Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know. Huh. * See note above
B:	And then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico now.
A:	A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too. That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
B:	Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.  Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.
A:	Yeah, yeah, and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that, uh, have and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust, and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.
B:	I only have one other person I know in my, in my group here that works where the wife stays home, and that's because of religious values as well. They're Baptists and they, and they think that's important.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, huh-uh. No we don't.
A:	And I really don't agree with that I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, than having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible. I don't think that they could be objective in every case, every time.
B:	And that's, it's kind of fun.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
B:	Yeah. You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds you know, that have the water piped out
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right. I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.
A:	If, if, if I had the car I wanted.
B:	What are you studying down there?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, I know what family home evening's all about.
A:	Oh.
B:	But it gets to the point where, I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.
A:	It really, it, there's not a whole lot, there really isn't. Uh, I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each house has, they're, they're given three baskets
B:	Yeah.
A:	She didn't announce that to you?
B:	Right. They shouldn't allow an appeal.
A:	see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff. And, um, I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a, a vegetable.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Huh.
B:	and then you go over and release it and then it just, it just drops, you know.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	Nor do we, but,
A:	Right, we have enough, enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is. So let, let their country take care of it.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. We we usually have most of it made into, uh, hamburger meat, though. And cook, you know, spaghetti with it.
A:	But, and my garden, you know, my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
B:	I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice
A:	Oh, the movie was a joke compared to, I mean, because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
B:	Yeah.
A:	We don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
A:	And really, that's about, that's really about it. Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?
B:	And, uh, just, it wasn't even a, a full tent. It would be more a tarp, uh strung up between trees
A:	Wow, you're,  a pro at this.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay, you ready to discuss the, the topic?
B:	And then put that back in the saucepan?
A:	And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
B:	and I ski, ski, do you ski?
A:	Yeah.
B:	If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there
A:	Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes? Or just,
B:	Yeah. So now they're like marking, uh, they're, I don't know, there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.
A:	Hit the bags.
B:	we just like it real well Yeah,
A:	Uh-huh.
