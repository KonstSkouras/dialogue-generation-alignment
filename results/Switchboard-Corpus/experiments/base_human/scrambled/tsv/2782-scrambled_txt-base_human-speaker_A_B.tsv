A:	Uh-huh. Well, I do. I just, I love it. It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport. And, uh, I'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet. We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet. But, uh,
B:	And doing what, trying to get them set up, inculturated,  into the system.
A:	Ten acres.
B:	Yeah
A:	If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest But it, that was really, really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
B:	Yeah, you learn the, you know, the hard way, you hate paying all that interest and I've never been one to itemize on my income, tax and never had enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying, so much more for that item, because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what, forty dollars sometimes just to have the card.
A:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Because they're fancy seats and stuff.
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
B:	I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty but,
A:	There's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
B:	Yes.
A:	Yeah, yeah, I think so too. But, you know, it's one of those things.
B:	Yeah.
A:	It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem
B:	Yeah. Isn't, isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was.
A:	Yeah.
B:	It's a legal job, you know
A:	yeah, now, Dallas is a I'm being very sarcastic, it's just a great,  uh, on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,
B:	I know, in, in the Dallas metroplex area, I don't go out hardly if I don't have to at night by myself
A:	Mashed potatoes with, uh, cheese melted over the top of them. A couple things like that. It was pretty good little dinner. Yeah, usually it's
B:	but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. It's like, you know, I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know
A:	Right.
B:	No? Didn't have shrimp there huh
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason, you can just go and vote
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's something, you know but, uh, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.
B:	Right. Yeah.
A:	you're not President Bush. I know and he said yeah, it does so fast , I heard it on the radio. I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but I didn't see it but,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,
B:	I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
A:	Yes.
B:	Well, that's good. That's great.
A:	What type of lawn and garden work do you do?
B:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
A:	Huh, that, you're the opposite of me. I drive an hour each way to work and so if I just use time and not say one, which quality is the best, I guess, that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio and then newspapers and T V would be tied after that because maybe I'll catch the, the evening news, like ten o'clock on T V and I,
B:	Does your family normally have a reunion? Do you have one,
A:	Do you have a favorite instrument?
B:	They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
A:	Right. Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on. We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, Delaware along the ocean most every year. And that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
A:	Yeah, we have. We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.
B:	So you've been there longer. We built this one about, uh, it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
A:	and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.
B:	and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes. And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not. Can't get it from mosquitoes. And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions, yes.
A:	Don't get enough sleep as it is, right
B:	Yeah.
A:	What I've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something, I make, uh, food kabobs. You take little toothpicks and cut up, uh, pineapple and strawberry, and even banana if you can do it just before you leave.
B:	Uh, not all of them
A:	at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
B:	Huh.
A:	Yeah,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh, oh yeah.
B:	Well,
A:	And, uh, this was during a holdup of a, uh, uh, a restaurant and it came out during the trial that, um, they had tried to rob another place and, uh, when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a couple cookies, and, uh, you know, jumbo cookies and, and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.
B:	Yeah, it's usually beautiful up there isn't it?
A:	I just like I just finished watching that a few minutes ago, Um, and it and, that, that's a interesting one. I, I, I like that, because there's, there are , I've noticed that every, every major station now has their own law show. There's L A LAW, and there's, um, EQUAL JUSTICE, some other one, LAW AND ORDER or something. Do you like the law shows or,
B:	I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma.
A:	Uh,
B:	Gosh.
A:	Right. Right. And you usually get what you pay for. We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas, and they were like ten dollars, and we expected them to work nice for the little kids, and they didn't work worth anything
B:	I have not read that, although, I have heard it is pretty good.
A:	It really is.
B:	I would love to be called, I'm ready to go They just haven't called me up yet
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. You get, it back, yeah.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you too, good luck and don't spend any money this weekend
A:	Oh. Okay.
B:	Uh, some of them. The, the general travel magazines do.
A:	That's really nice to find out that it's behind there Well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers. I couldn't even think of what you call them.
B:	Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.
A:	Um, what's our topic?
B:	Right. Okay.
A:	Exactly.
B:	But, I think people try to, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff, but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.
A:	My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult. Was she in favor of it or, or was she kind of opposed to it?
B:	and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
A:	Uh-huh. I've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, but that takes time, that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
B:	When they, when they switch to, switch,
A:	Oh.
B:	Right.
A:	Huh. Well, that's, Well, that sounds interesting. Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.
B:	Uh, I work for Georgia Tech. Yes sir. I work for the research facility. Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense but it, it does have, about, uh, I guess, two thousand civil employees.
