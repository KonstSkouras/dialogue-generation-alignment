A:	and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.
B:	That's great.
A:	Well, great, well look, uh, I know it's probably late for you,
B:	And I don't like that
A:	Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
B:	Uh, I think something will have to be done down there very soon about, uh, about Mexico and, and, uh, some of the other areas, but, but, with the Persian Gulf, as you said, it's just, uh, been very quiet. I, I keep pretty close tabs on the paper and you don't hardly see a, unless it's there and we're just not seeing it.
A:	Um, and one of the quick examples is the Aborigines.
B:	Well, we're Catholics. I came from a family of five. I had four brothers,
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
B:	You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
A:	Oh.
B:	Do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
A:	Yeah, if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,
B:	Always want to go to Canada Canada to Banff or somewhere like that
A:	That's, that's been my impression.
B:	We when I was, when I bought my last purebred retriever I mean I looked all over because I wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure.
B:	Yeah, really. If they survive this year. Oh, well, good luck to you.
A:	But he jumped in, in the, the river.
B:	Yeah
A:	Uh, I play the piano
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Bradford's north of us.
A:	Yeah. Has Herschel Walker done much for them?
B:	And, uh,
A:	I want to see your driver's I, I, I don't,
B:	yeah, yeah it, it really is, uh, but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.
A:	Right.
B:	No, no, no. I generally would uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, I listen to K C B I a lot but I will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
B:	but yet you can have your friends, uh, you can have them in, you can go out.
A:	Who wrote that?
B:	And I do, I don't have a sprinkler system. I, I don't enjoy watering.
A:	But, all in all, they mind pretty well. But, I guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have? Here I'm getting off the subject.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I guess,
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, is your brother younger than you or,
B:	Bye-bye.
A:	Well, but, actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports. Tennis, I play tennis.
B:	Yes.
A:	Do you know where that is?
B:	Right.
A:	And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals. I do that right now,
B:	And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more
A:	Yes, true.
B:	Uh, Pennsylvania. Yeah.
A:	I don't think I would go through that expense. One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours
B:	That's the hard part, right?
A:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Yeah.
A:	And it, it takes a lot of care like twenty-four hours a day someone, has to be, Well, there's someone in my, my fiancee's family.
B:	because I I think, what do you have there? It's a house,
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well it was nice talking to you too, I enjoyed it.
A:	Right.
B:	we had five children, so and they've all moved you know, on.
A:	Uh, Dallas is having quite a few. Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related. Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. Right. Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
B:	Uh, right, right. Right, right.
A:	But, we've, uh, we've done, uh, many types of camping. We've, we've done tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
B:	Oh, sure. Oh, I bet it's beautiful.
A:	Oh, yeah?
B:	Right.
A:	Yeah, and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.
B:	Like, like, name one
A:	Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.
B:	uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
A:	But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, I,
B:	What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?
A:	Oh, really?
B:	so.
A:	Well, I think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though, you have to do something.
B:	Right. Yeah.
A:	A chocolate powder.
B:	No, well, they have it at six and they have it at nine,
A:	Exactly.
B:	I'm I'm with the N R A myself.
A:	you know. So I just go, you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there, you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
B:	She'll be two in July.
A:	They don't have any, they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know because we're all going to get old someday.
