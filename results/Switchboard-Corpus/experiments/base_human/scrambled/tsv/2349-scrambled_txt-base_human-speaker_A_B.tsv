A:	But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
B:	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	Really.
B:	Really?
A:	It, uh, Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
B:	you can't help it's like, it's like a kid.
A:	Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing. And she does make a lot of sense.
B:	And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think.
A:	it, with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday. With kids they don't care, you know, uh, a about a lot of things. But as adults, uh, it's like if I don't take a shower every day, I feel like, you know, ooh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that I could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
B:	You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think.
A:	Although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
B:	Yeah, he sure is, he just became a grandfather.
A:	We just got our last tomatoes.
B:	Yeah, I love those, too. They're just so relaxing.
A:	And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,
B:	And they don't have a goal, they don't have a goal, they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
A:	Right, right.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then part of it's lack of education. I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, yeah, I do a lot of exercise. Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which I absolutely love. Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some weight over the past few years and I wanted to get it back off
B:	Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.
A:	Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha, and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in
B:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, my, well, then.
B:	That's, that's a lot of kids, though.
A:	Um,
B:	but I was very young so I don't remember that and, I was three when we moved back here.
A:	Yes.
B:	Oh, that works.
A:	Uh-huh. Is it, uh, how about the injection,
B:	That would be nice.
A:	Oh, is that right? Okay.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
A:	You know, it's across the way, and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
B:	I'll say .
A:	I just, again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be. I,
B:	So, Oh.
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
B:	Oh, okay. So, but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.
A:	So we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in and got seated, and then no one knew English in there, and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
B:	Really.
A:	Yeah. I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, do you know which way it is the ratio, it's more than, aren't, uh, it's more that don't have it,
B:	Yeah.
A:	You know, I, I really agree with you. Um, I, uh, though I've never done that myself, I, I'm, was a basically an education major when I graduated from college and I accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to, um, very rural children in a very low income district and I spent a year teaching there
B:	I think it's still the New York Yankees, you know,
A:	Oh. Do you have brothers and sisters?
B:	but I don't know. He, he's, he, the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his, my brother plays, and, um, I don't, I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know, it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something, you know.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Well they range from, let's see about a year and a half to nine years old.
A:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
A:	Um, it filled , a lot of people try to stay away from this but I make my own homemade pudding just because I don't like box pudding.
B:	Yeah, and, and also, um, the, the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell.
A:	Wow. Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?
B:	I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself.
A:	and, uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
B:	Uh, where I live now it's, it's not so bad. I mean I can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it. Uh, but I do have friends that live in the city and I think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. Uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.
A:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
A:	That's right, but you can't take this money with us, though
B:	So,  that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.
B:	Right. Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother I have three children and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young, I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.
A:	Yes, we do.
B:	Yeah, well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I do it all
A:	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you.
B:	So that is why we you know play over there cause we have got our card
A:	Bye-bye.
B:	No cracked slab or anything like that?
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, I tape it because I don't stay up that late to watch it,
A:	I see.
B:	Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
A:	The Legend. Uh.
B:	And
A:	What degree, I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college?
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.
A:	But, uh, Yeah, but, I mean, a, a, a lot of people would get involved and, you know, because there were all different, organizations to do. There was Big Brother, Big Sister,
B:	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else, and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
B:	I don't know how much I know about this subject
