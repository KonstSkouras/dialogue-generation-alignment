A:	Uh-huh.
B:	I really don't know. It just seems like I here it on the news the day before.
A:	um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything I think
B:	and they say, hey, you know, two thousand dollars, you know, free to you kind of thing, you know, all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan. I hate it,
A:	There's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	Oh.
B:	Beautiful.
A:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, um, it's, it's, you know, they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
B:	Yeah, well, you know, you just have to decide, you know, well there's really two separate decisions there I guess, one is, did it really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know, is this man really guilty, and you have to decide that, but then you have to decide, you know, as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing.
A:	I enjoy, Excuse me, go ahead. Uh-huh.
B:	How are they built?
A:	Well good, well, then have a good day.
B:	No, actually, uh, I'm not even sure, I may, I'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas
A:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
A:	Right
B:	Yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
A:	Uh, actually no. We have, uh, quite a bit, uh, the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
B:	Yeah.
A:	He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
B:	Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.
A:	And the government really plays a role in this.
B:	Yeah, and wasn't that fun. I went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me, and I must say I attracted a lot of attention.
A:	Okay. Hey, thanks so much for the conversation.
B:	And a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible. Some of them in the penal system.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. And I think, you know, we have such a need now, you know, I taught, you know, I, I think I was paid, uh, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
B:	But they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
A:	I mean she actually asks to go out.
B:	So you,
A:	Right, and then, you know, sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but, We're, it's real important to us to spend time together.
B:	So they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
A:	Uh-huh, and the skunk.
B:	I can't, it, it's a oh gosh, it's like Elijah, or something like that.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
B:	And I've been watching them every day and I've, and I haven't seen any signs yet. So, if I see any signs I'm going to spray them,
A:	enjoyed talking to you.
B:	No, it's, it's got people singing, but it's it is instrumental. But it's, it's got people singing but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing.
A:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	All local. Were they like all in Dallas?
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, I don't know if they've, they did something about I'm not sure if Texas, Minnesota, I, they didn't, they didn't, they were well, did they have it, they were against it, uh, Texas, as I said, has it but I haven't been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,  if they've done it in the last,
B:	Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.
A:	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.
B:	Yes, I certainly did.
A:	Yeah, yeah, I was, left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,
B:	ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.
A:	Oh, really, that's great. Uh, my daughter talked to a student. Uh, in general most of them, uh, people doing this are T I but I guess customers too, huh?
B:	Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.
A:	Oh, if you had it early.
B:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay, well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave, I mean  I, I lived in places, like
A:	Oh, dear.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
B:	We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.
A:	That's even harder. But,
B:	And he thoroughly enjoyed it.
A:	It is temporary. It, in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,
B:	Yes. Absolutely.
A:	I mean, we are all different so,
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
B:	But anyway, I enjoy it. They, they, the kids I've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking.
A:	Wow Wow, that's,
B:	or, uh,
A:	Yeah. Well, I figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so I want  to have a shop.
B:	Uh-huh.
A:	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
B:	Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right?
A:	Right.
B:	I'm building our house right now and I'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.
A:	You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power.
B:	Well, I don't want to, I don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but, yes, we do. Both my husband and I work and our children are sixth, fourth, and third grade. And the school years are wonderful, they're just wonderful.
A:	Huh.
B:	I'm in Dallas, Texas.
A:	And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling  to be doing that.
B:	Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.
A:	probably at all.
B:	and oh, my husband just died.
A:	Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
B:	I kind of, I think so, too. I think that's a bit dramatic, but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing, helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.
A:	Uh, got, you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
B:	All right.
A:	But, I used to work for a power company, so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
B:	The one that was in for the seventeen years, actually served seven, and he's out.
A:	Oh
