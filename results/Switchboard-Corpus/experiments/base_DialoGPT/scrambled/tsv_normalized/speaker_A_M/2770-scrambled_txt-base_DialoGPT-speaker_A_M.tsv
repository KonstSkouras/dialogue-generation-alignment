A:	i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
M:	it's not a connection. it's a city
A:	that's the problem i have with it, in texas they think it's and all and be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
M:	i think he was joking
A:	uh-huh.
