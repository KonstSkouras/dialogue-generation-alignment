A:	uh she has i i really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
M:	
A:	my my daughter's in the um fourth grade
M:	what
A:	and i don't think a cart damages the turf.
M:	that um uh uh?
A:	thirty or thirty-two for really good tickets. see they they sectioned it out even more. they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price. and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. and now they're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones. but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do.
M:	well you're not wrong.
A:	uh-huh golly i know.
M:	what? no.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think i know what you're talking about.
A:	they're kind of rare.
M:	that's what i'm saying. i'm not going to consider that a loss
A:	if you had to do something like that day after day.
M:	uhhh... you are still out there.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not sure but i'm pretty sure it's a lot.
A:	yeah. i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
M:	
A:	and how you're in  rome new york
M:	did you guys have any color in your leaves?
A:	and uh
M:	we have a bedroom and a bath.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm so down for this.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	the problem is that they're probably not trying it out in a home.
A:	with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know. is really kind of bad
M:	i'm saying that the real people in the world would be able to see them all day.
A:	and uh i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there is a a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
M:	you can't really learn new skill when you are older it's like you have to be really good at something.
A:	but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want. and i just don't see it like that. of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have but um maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but i can't stand owing. i mean i cannot fully tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that. but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout. but that's just the way i feel about it.
M:	i'm in texas.
A:	absolutely. they really go through it
M:	i can't
A:	well i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons.
M:	that's right.
A:	and you're thinking oh you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting uh
M:	...what
A:	yeah.
M:	there is that?
A:	every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule where you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs. instead of taking them up there solid.
M:	
A:	yeah he's like i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is if you know about neal bush i think is his name.
M:	you mean like like recycling?
A:	he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together.
M:	they're in the recycling bin.

M:	not.
A:	yeah. yeah. and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything and oh it was just awful. so um i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled. but i think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
