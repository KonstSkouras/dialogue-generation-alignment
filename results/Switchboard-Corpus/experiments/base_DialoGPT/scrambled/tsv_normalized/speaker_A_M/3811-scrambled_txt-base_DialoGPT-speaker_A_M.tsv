A:	i bet it had a pretty coat too.
M:	oh, it's not. i'm not too sure about that, i don't think so.

A:	so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home, and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility. she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
M:	what
A:	yeah, he sure did.
M:	umm... he
A:	which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. so, i guess i'm, i'm, i'd like to see us spend more. i don't know that spending more always gets it.
M:	and what if we eat it?
A:	you owe it to yourself

A:	we have found state parks, not that they're lacking but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a k o a where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner. you've got the showers available. it's not, you know, in the same category. state parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different. but, so we've always kind of stayed with a k o a and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. that's the only time you really use your campground. if you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	yeah, it's tough. it's tough.
