A:	is that how you i have never
M:	i don't know.
A:	well it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. there's always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas and i know we lived in chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there. so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this. it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in. i don't know whether that's it or street gangs. i don't know what the answer is. i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.

M:	how do we could'a and i
A:	really.
M:	i've got it all laid out now.
A:	i know florida has it.
M:	but they're still the same.
A:	and it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
M:	it's just a little bit of a pain.
A:	oh how funny i can imagine. yeah i wouldn't give anything for my cats. i love them to death.

M:	you..
A:	and we're leasing a uh two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas.
M:	yeah please yes and.
A:	well that's okay. i guess it's an easy thing to do. so you're you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have?
M:	but you could've done much much better.
