A:	well, um, actually it, we've sort of had an ideal spring.
M:	you, eh
A:	yeah, they, they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they, about eight months ago they gave it to us.
M:	... we
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then the police would just do it in prison.
A:	oh, i like that too. but, uh, in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, i think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
M:	yeah, i think you're right.
A:	so that was really fun.
M:	are you?
A:	uh-huh. back when they were in saint louis?
M:	well, i guess that makes it okay then.
A:	i know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, i guess. uh,
M:	so did they give us some of that deer?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's not that
A:	oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	yeah, the, you, a to, the to, he's

M:	no, i don t like rain.
A:	right.
M:	l
A:	but he is the lovingest cat. everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.
M:	i'm gonna say yes
A:	yep.
M:	so she's not a brown eyed girl?
A:	and i, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
M:	we, they have, you,
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	yeah. but i think it would be a lot easier to do if we could just do it for the other ones.
A:	yeah.
M:	you're, you're, it's, it was, it is
A:	yeah, i, uh, i ethically don't like the idea but, or i should say morally i don't like the idea, but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically i think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	but you're right, it is temporary. well, i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	i'm in texas. where are you?
A:	yeah.
M:	have you been to europe?
A:	so those are the real killers. if he's just gone,
M:	what if you have a family and family members who would like to go home?
A:	i, i think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	i've never seen it like that before. how is it?
A:	okay, i mean like business programs or, man.
M:	it's hot and humid and humid.
A:	uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
M:	see you soon
A:	oh, well, anyway. uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
M:	oh, i just... i just love them.
A:	about, uh, like you say, using them, our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
M:	i'd like to see a picture of a real job
A:	like i say it's just,
M:	what?
A:	uh-huh. i see.
M:	oh uh uh uh, uh uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yes.
A:	yeah, yeah, well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.
M:	uhhh, you don't know what a joke is.
A:	i'd, i'd love to go back there. there's just not time there's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
M:	if you could, sure.
A:	and, i also believe we don't, even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
M:	what's the other thing?
A:	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
M:	and, uh, i think, you know, and
A:	i really, i really like the mercedes.
M:	
A:	yeah.
M:	i, i

A:	uh, oh, i think, we're, we're supposed to hang up.
M:	don't you hate it when your own child cries?
A:	but, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
M:	we've got four bedrooms, because we're the one that got hit by a car.
A:	oh, really? oh. you really rough it then.
M:	i'll be right there with you. i'm going to get a ticket for this.
A:	and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but i don't really like having to do it. it,
M:	i, uh, uh
A:	for music?
M:	i'm not,
A:	and a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
