A:	uh-huh.
M:	uh uh uh
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society.
M:	it's not it's a good job.
A:	really? that much of a difference?
M:	i'm still confused it's a t s not a t c
A:	yeah.
M:	when is the patch coming?
A:	well we were there in the winter. in uh january or february i don't remember which
M:	...
A:	kalli  k a l l i? okay.
M:	err yes. i'd rather have the metal in the water rather than a mess of rust.
A:	sure. yeah.
M:	you're not my friend.
A:	yeah.
M:	what happened.again.again.
A:	yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there are going to be killed. um there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent and they want i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
M:	i think the only place i've ever met them was in the civil war
A:	snow
M:	are you the one who did?
A:	hopefully
M:	uh huh.
A:	um but he had actually was able to get him over that.
M:	she's a nurse.
A:	might make you feel better but
M:	why? how?
A:	really?
M:	yes but they do.
A:	so i've enjoyed that part of it. yeah. and at the gym even in the class uh i it's not really a group where you chat a lot. everybody's on their way to someplace
M:	i don'ts?
A:	so uh we play that a lot of them and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
M:	i'm.
A:	and then i was going to make other things like potato skins.
M:	well they are
A:	um so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
M:	the real question is when was the last time you saw a man?
A:	oh really?
M:	what? no it's not.
A:	but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect.
M:	what about the millions of people who have never been caught?
A:	so it was it was a pleasant time.
M:	the bank is paying for it.
A:	yeah.
M:	that's a pretty good idea i think i might do it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and if they do?
A:	right.
M:	uhh you're thinking of a serial killer.
A:	i think was the last time i was up up there and at center park.
M:	i can't help but feel like this is an ad for a breed.
A:	it depends on you can really vary it.
M:	you can't say that.
A:	same thing  yes.
M:	the best part is when you realize it's true.
A:	of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are uh spending money that does not belong to them. so
M:	are they in texas?
A:	yeah. you put in um
M:	well uh uh.
A:	how big is it? how many square feet do you have?
M:	it was by itself.
A:	and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it is split with the rest with everybody in the group.
M:	i have about 6 months worth of my money.
A:	right.
M:	i'm not a native i just like to go
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't have any in the bank.
A:	the factory was nice and and is it different for the for the b m w?
M:	i
A:	and i would never do it. i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me.
M:	i think it would be a good idea to have the supreme courts review the cases of the supreme courts and the supreme court of appeals.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	there's no such thing as a bad time for me.
A:	okay i wasn't sure. most of the ones you know up north and everything do but um anyway it's uh it's pretty also pretty typical for the area. most of this area was developed this house was built in seventy-four.
M:	yes because the people who were arrested are guilty of murder.
A:	uh. yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book.
M:	you dont have to
A:	no actually i haven't been all through europe  like i haven't been to italy yet.
M:	
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
M:	 defic
A:	and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach
M:	that's not really how it works.
A:	yeah.
M:	i have a lot of stuff to do.it's a bit busy.
A:	well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes.
M:	
A:	yes. i think we ought to worry about our own species.
M:	ohh why you.
A:	that's right. that that would be the problem. sure would.
M:	you mean like in a place where the ground is dirt?
