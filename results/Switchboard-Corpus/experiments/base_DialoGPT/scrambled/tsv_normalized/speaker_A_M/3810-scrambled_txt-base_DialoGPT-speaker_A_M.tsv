A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. right.
M:	what do you not
A:	and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you in the winter time when that when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
M:	i know.
A:	so it's okay.
M:	i think we have one room but that's all

M:	they're a bunch of twisted people.
A:	yeah that's exactly it.
M:	we
A:	i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of you know people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and uh i don't know
M:	it would be interesting to see how many people would go.
A:	and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and uh i guess
M:	is that a dog?
A:	uh-huh. yeah that's true.
M:	it isnt.but if they had to spend a lot more money on advertising it wouldnt be a lot but it would be.
A:	no. yeah. there was a t i has got this organization called t a d which is t i'ers against drugs. and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know and that's they use the money from that to fund this t i'ers against drugs program. it's you know t i doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that. and they had talked about having a thing like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know
M:	i think it's just a weird coincidence.
