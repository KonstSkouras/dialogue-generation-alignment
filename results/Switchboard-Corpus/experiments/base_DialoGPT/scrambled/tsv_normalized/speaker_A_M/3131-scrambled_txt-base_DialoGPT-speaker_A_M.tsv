A:	but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
M:	you wanna see?
A:	yeah. i'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, do you know which way it is the ratio, it's more than, aren't, uh, it's more that don't have it,
M:	i'm in high school, can you explain?
A:	i teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano, but he can't learn like that. he's a delayed child. he's only about, i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
M:	i think he was in prison.
A:	yep, they, a lot of, um, of a, um, winter produce comes from south america.
M:	that's where my family grew
A:	bye-bye.
M:	no
A:	which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
M:	... and she's like, i know.
A:	well, i'm not even sure all of them are anymore. at least in this area.
M:	oh, i see.
A:	that's true. but i was thinking boy, in dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.
M:	i was there, you can see me.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	umm. uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	... uh, yes?
A:	he never meows, he, he doesn't have any front claws, i had him declawed,
M:	well, that's the only reason i've ever had to use it.
A:	i hope so.
M:	
A:	so, so i, i think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
M:	i'm not sure what you mean.
A:	so what type, simply red, i've never heard of that. is it just instrumental?
M:	you know, i'll just walk over to the other side of the river.
A:	oh.
M:	i'm doing it too
A:	huh.
M:	yeah, but you're from france.
A:	have a good weekend.
M:	huh, uh.
A:	and i was, i was there this, uh, summer and, uh, i was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for b m w.
M:	it's okay.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you like it.
A:	and that really helped us out a great deal. so. but my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too.
M:	well, it's not my fault, i have a lot of people to work with.
A:	huh.
M:	and we all thought we were going to move there.
A:	okay, well thanks for your time. i enjoyed talking to you.
M:	it
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you.
A:	if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest but it, that was really, really fabulous and just the photos i have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
M:	i
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	i mean, how many games have you won?
A:	but they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. you know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them. now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called rodolfo's over on preston road and royal lane i believe.
M:	i'm not, i'm from texas
A:	you know, it's, i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
M:	i am
A:	so, uh, i,
M:	well, i mean, you're not wrong.
A:	well, then, um,
M:	how do you like your...
A:	yes. right. oh, great.
M:	it's a common misconception.
A:	yes. uh-huh. well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?
M:	have you?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but there is no other way to play.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, to
A:	uh-huh. paris. and my cousin lives in paris and she's lived there for like, oh, off and on for twenty years.
M:	they just have a big yard and it's like a big house.
A:	but i, i don't know the performance of it. that's a, ford product,
M:	i'm not.
A:	and, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision i think.
M:	i think you'll find it's a very confusing shop.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	this, uh, doesn't, uh. nothin ', uh...
A:	well, yeah, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, there's, uh, there's pluses to everything,
M:	do you?
A:	okay.
M:	yes.but.yes.it.is.up.to.now.if.but, the crime is down.
A:	yeah, i've done it before and when i was in in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it,
M:	...
A:	which that,
M:	i think so.let's see
A:	yeah, where are you?
M:	but, uh, i'm not sure you understand how it works
A:	well,
M:	it's why.
A:	so there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the u s budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages. i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it
M:	ohhuh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i wouldn't
A:	yeah.
M:	i know, that's why i said i was a little bit scared.
A:	huh.
M:	i'm gonna tape my fingers to my nails, i'm gonna do it.
A:	i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then, again, i don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
M:	what do you mean?
