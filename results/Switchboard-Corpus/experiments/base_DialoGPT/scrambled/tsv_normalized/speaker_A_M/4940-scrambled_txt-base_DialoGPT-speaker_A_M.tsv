A:	you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
M:	you know i don't really know the guy's personality. he's a pretty nice guy but i don'know what it is.

M:	what?
A:	uh-huh. it was amazing i went to the far east uh back in october to do some training for t i and i
M:	that's what i said.i think that you can remove the judge.but can't you remove the defendant.and it's not like there's a jury.
A:	yeah and that would be pushing it. so i mean this is definitely a college town. uh we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any. uh
M:	this is not an answer
A:	but all in all they mind pretty well. but i guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have? here i'm getting off the subject.
M:	uhm uh huh.
A:	yeah
M:	i vote yes
A:	i guess my my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six and then probably seventy-five during the day.
M:	i don't know uhhhhh
A:	not as independence.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
M:	i think it should be a crime.
A:	uh-huh. oh okay well they seem to be on later
M:	i have a lot of books uh.uh.uh
A:	where is it in dallas?

A:	what what do you think? oh yeah. yeah.
M:	... but... it's not a problem.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	for colleges?
M:	it's not.
A:	yeah this is it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh.
M:	it's a joke i'm sure he's joking.
A:	right
M:	it's still uhuhhuh?
A:	are you a summer person?
M:	i don't think you understand the concept of a job.
A:	yeah.
M:	thanks for the talk.
A:	huh that you're the opposite of me. i drive an hour each way to work and so if i just use time and not say one which quality is the best i guess that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio and then newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i'll catch the the evening news like ten o'clock on t v and i
M:	she got me a copy of the iphone app for school.
A:	yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way i guess most of the um the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose
M:	are you uh interested in any of this?
A:	usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner.
M:	i'm sorry i'm sorry.
A:	i'm not sure what but
M:	you pay them.
A:	so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother.
M:	it.uh uh
A:	yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth you know worth bothering to go in and do but. do you um have any ideas on anything that would make
M:	but you can see the difference between the two
A:	you know i i really agree with you. um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there
M:	what are you talking about?
A:	oh okay.
M:	you
A:	bye-bye or
M:	i like it.
A:	that's really nice to find out that it's behind there well we pretty much do um plastic milk cartons and um um um newspapers. i couldn't even think of what you call them.
M:	
A:	oh really.
M:	they do but i don t think they make enough money to be profitable.
A:	plus i guess if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever.
M:	hmmm. i don't know.
A:	just a moment okay nancy then i guess the today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.
M:	how is that even possible?
A:	well i agree absolutely and you know it's all relative because i was from west texas and it was very dry and so i thought dallas was awful and i still think so but then this summer we went to orlando for a week and it was so humid there that your um all your windows were were wet every morning. they had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
M:	i like the weather.
A:	yes.
M:	they uh have a family
A:	the economy around here is real poor
M:	so... how's it going?
A:	i know that that  uh-huh. and i don't know. uh what would you do to change it? to make it better?
M:	i'm sorry. i'm sorry i'm so sorry.
A:	oh that's nice.
M:	you mean like a regular tooth?
A:	and now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to for the last couple of years i've done it myself.
M:	serial murder
A:	i i know but it it's it's uh easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me.
M:	you can say that again
