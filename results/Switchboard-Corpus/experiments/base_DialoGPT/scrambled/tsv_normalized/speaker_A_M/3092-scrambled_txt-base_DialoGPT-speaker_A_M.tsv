A:	got a problem huh? um
M:	you're a little late on the cat hate train.
A:	uh-huh. right right. yeah i i i imagine you're right. i i teach swim lessons a lot and and to see what see what kids talk about when uh you know they're they're open about well you know kids are a lot more educated now than i think that that like we were uh at that age um about a lot of things.
M:	but uh i'm a guy.
A:	uh-huh. they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they it puts a whole in your money bag *spelling: hole we don't honor god with this portion and so they i think that helps a lot. i think that's the key in he like his sales last year he just works a normal job. he probably has an income of thirty-five thousand but last year he made that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van. he loves god i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done
M:	i dont have a link but i have a feeling that the owner of the car is driving the wrong way.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you
A:	yeah. they don't do that here. course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
M:	we're not
A:	and we only have one. we tore all the rest of them up.
M:	yes of have
A:	oh yeah. i bet that's a pretty nice setup.
M:	well there is a garage there.
A:	did you scuba dive there?
M:	so we're all just living off of their at their expense.
A:	oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars
M:	yes i think i do.
A:	then i i'd love to go somewhere in asia but i'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
M:	
A:	i i wasn't helping them. i worked with them not to help them but for my own purposes. i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit. and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me. but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
M:	uhhh i think we've all been there.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and the insurance is on her.
A:	no.
M:	uh how do you know that?
A:	"well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective. uh i think this ""me"" generation has gone far too far. and the young people are overly impressed. and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint."
M:	it's probably not a bad idea.
A:	i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes. at least my daughters have. they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. so it's worked pretty well. there's i don't really think anything's been broken. every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know.
M:	h
A:	because everyone gains from it.
M:	oh.my.god.hahaha
A:	yeah that that would all start at at um that would all start at at eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven. we have um at seven o'clock we just have um the they'll play you know they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight
M:	no. no no. it's japanese.
A:	what about you?
M:	it was the first thing i thought of.
A:	oh well that's great.
M:	i love.
A:	right.
M:	but it's not an airplane it's a fuel tanker.
A:	i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like.
M:	i think
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	it's not.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. we did that too
M:	
A:	and that's not really beneficial so uh i don't have time like that
M:	why not on the weekend?
A:	oh yeah. i mean you know.  there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M:	that.
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	i'm going to say it. the cats.
A:	my mother well she's like seventy-four now. she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both and uh
M:	i think it's.
A:	no my husband does.
M:	do you play classical flutes?
A:	taco bueno right uh-huh.
M:	i go
A:	i just think that everybody ought to do it.
M:	but... the company is still a part of the company.
A:	it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night.
M:	they're
A:	what uh is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
M:	you're the one who's downvoting me i'm telling you what i think
A:	yeah we we've been married for two and a half years. we've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
M:	
A:	but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good.
M:	i don't want to make any promises but i'm going to take a bath with a bath.
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh. right because they're a danger to everybody else. huh that's interesting. i have to uh agree with that.
M:	... what?
A:	i would love that.
M:	i know.
A:	yeah.
M:	yeah i know.
A:	yeah flavor. uh-huh. yeah.
M:	you don't have any proof.
A:	all right.
M:	uhhh i'm sorry?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you are in the area?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uuh uh she?
A:	did you?
M:	i'm going crazy
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm sure you'll be happy.
A:	so um well i have not really paid much attention because i clock although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so um if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
M:	no it was not.
A:	yeah. have you ever used do you use wordperfect ever? have you ever used wordperfect? or
M:	i
A:	well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin i was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue. i don't know if it will come out.
M:	i do that all the time and it works.
A:	yeah i know.
M:	i'm a pilot and i work in the military so.
A:	and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it produce electricity.
M:	do you know how much time i have to wait to buy my guns?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's actually pretty neat.
A:	yeah. uh maybe maybe too a big social change that's that's maybe for the worst is uh is is how um the people's uh views on on relationships has changed you know and now we have now we have several you know we have to worry about aids and we have to worry about uh maybe people are becoming more aware more more afraid of relationships.
M:	what do you mean you think it's not a good time
A:	uh-huh huh. do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society. it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that.
M:	uhhh i know.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	there is no way you read that you should be ashamed.
A:	and and so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
M:	so uh do we have any other food?
A:	yeah.  uh-huh. so as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in college station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
M:	yeah uh that's not the same.
A:	so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there.
M:	i know.
A:	yeah.
M:	.
M:	she's so kind.
