A:	uh-huh.
M:	well, if you're happy with your wife, you can have her. if not, then you're not a real woman.
A:	the next generation, uh-huh.
M:	because of?
A:	oh, i have. i've, i've, i watched that late, um, i guess it's on late saturday nights or something,
M:	i'm just wondering.
A:	yeah. yeah, i understand. we just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
M:	i am so confused.
A:	uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal. singapore is very, supposed to be very safe and, in fact, tokyo, and i thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
M:	you
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. right, uh-huh.
M:	i guess she's not too fond of it then.
A:	see, i've only been to texas once. i have two sisters in texas now, um, one in austin, one in dallas, and the one in dallas is the one that got me to doing this
M:	it.
A:	yeah, i do too. well, it's been good talking with you.
M:	no we don't.
A:	and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, you lucky thing.
M:	n
A:	but, uh, so, do you do, uh, in texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
M:	wait, what?
A:	you listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.
M:	do you have a tablet?
A:	but i mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, i mean besides murder, i think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,  caught more than twice or something, uh,  it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
M:	i think so.uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't, uh, i don't want to, uh...
A:	and rascal is a black and white short hair.
M:	so, what happened?
A:	my kid will do four or five hours this week for me.  no problem.
M:	i just,
A:	also saves a lot of time with commercials.
M:	well, i got a few plants from my garden, so i can get them all over the place.
A:	oh, that's great.
M:	how are you?
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
M:	oh. that's cool.
A:	uh, i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki. which is an auditory type learning experience.
M:	that's true, but i think it's because he's in jail, and he's being held at gunpoint
A:	are you going to go to east texas for that?
M:	i'm not quite sure,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, i'm sure it would, but i think
A:	but, uh, it has quieted down, but i don't think they probably feel any differently,
M:	well, we have the dog right now.
A:	and so, but that somehow takes, organization. for me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, i can, i can do some of my reading,
M:	
A:	right.
M:	well, i've been eating for the past few days.
A:	i would not imagine that.
M:	i know what you're talking about, but what about the other thing?
A:	yeah, that's good.
M:	i don't know, it just goes all around.
A:	flooding anywhere. i have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, i mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, but, uh, no, i've not heard of any particular problems this time.
M:	you.
A:	sure, yeah,
M:	
A:	and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves. um,
M:	i think it's polk institute of technology
A:	um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
M:	you think that's wrong?
A:	those are nice, aren't they?   yes, those are nice.
M:	they're just making a joke.
A:	yeah, you probably get this, probably pretty sticky after you get done.
M:	is she ok?
A:	so.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	okay.
M:	this is a shame.
A:	in fact, i think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
M:	well, i can
A:	yes. that, that was true for mine too. uh, although i i'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, but i don't think, i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.  you know, i  think that, uh, i mean i know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.
M:	:you
A:	yes.
M:	
A:	all that stuff that's bad for you.
M:	well, that's, uh, not good.
A:	uh, they sure are just because, some innocent person, can really,
M:	i know. it's just, i don't really know what the other guy was thinking.
A:	and we have to pay that price, but, uh, i don't know, i don't know. it's interesting, and i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,
M:	uh... and then, uh, we have a baby and we're married in minneapolis.
A:	i mean but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is it, uh, asian or is it european or who,
M:	i'll be sure to.
