A:	oh no.
M:	what
A:	i think so i think because people sort of get through you know um i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.
M:	do you like the potato salad?
A:	which is rare.
M:	you have a basement it's not a problem.
A:	no they're all of them are tested once every three
M:	yes.uh um
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yup. i'm from there.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	heh i see what you did there.
A:	uh okay.
M:	i'll have to check when i get home but i think it'll be around three or five dollars.
A:	okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um
M:	right and
A:	there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
M:	it's not an orthodon. it's a pallet.
A:	uh probably. uh actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh five days a week more than likely. uh depending on how my class schedule runs
M:	i uh i think i'm gonna need to see some medical records.
A:	i see.
M:	i've had a cat.
A:	yeah that's that's right talk to i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually you know had just purchased a gun that day  and was going target shooting you know
M:	do you like it?
A:	me to. bye bye.
M:	we have a cat.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm talking about the american kennels.
A:	i kind of uh stopped listening after a while.
M:	does it
A:	it's really really pretty. i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about mountain things. you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river
M:	
A:	oh how funny.
M:	...
A:	and then when i would come home and he would leave and um so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something. it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M:	we're going to do this.
A:	and uh really need a faster system. uh i got a new line that i i sell metal fabricating equipment and cat cam systems and tooling et cetera.
M:	you have a good point. i wonder what the other people are like.
A:	uh that was about a year and a half ago and
M:	
A:	you feel invigorated and you feel oh you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
M:	it's a bit over 2.5 million so that's a pretty good deal.
A:	oh my god.
M:	i guess so.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think they're volunteering for community
A:	right. right well i guess that's a good point uh
M:	you know
A:	yeah.
M:	i have the receipt for the consumsers.
A:	yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed  you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many.
M:	i don't know what you're talking about.
A:	i had a friend in i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while.
M:	i could probably get a tv in the middle of a city.
A:	and i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better and it's just uh i think it's well worth it. i just demand that time for myself. now i've learned to do that
M:	ohh.
A:	oh out of  as opposed to the insurance paying the bills
M:	 helicoptering
A:	she's i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken.
M:	because of the freedom of choices i guess.
A:	that's not too bad. golly the golden retrievers are good dogs too they're kind of like get that permanent smile to them
M:	he's not interested in the drums.
A:	there's always that chance i don't know but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
M:	uhh you like them?
A:	next thing you know you've got him.
M:	i hope you enjoyed your time here.
A:	problem uh-huh
M:	i know i'm just telling you that's how it sounded.

M:	but it's still not a thing right?
A:	oh really.
M:	what is it?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i do this i do this!
A:	bye.
M:	you're a.
A:	you know   they could  somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know that's a good starting wage
M:	no not that. i don't think so.
A:	and we got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
M:	that is the best thing about the car. when you're driving you're always at a full stop.
A:	on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory
M:	i just don't know how to tell the difference.
A:	that's right. i'm i'm kind of bad about that.
M:	yeah but i think it's just the most likely scenario.
A:	uh we're going to go for a conference in september and so hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too.
M:	uhhh... i don't know...
A:	uh wife and i we have we have two cats.
M:	no.
A:	okay.
M:	
A:	right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
M:	it's awwwww
A:	we we originally lived in dallas and we met and got married
M:	...
A:	oh yeah.
M:	i think they have uh some uhm winter produce coming from south america.
A:	oh yeah it's been it's been it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
M:	oh okay.
A:	but also most places like big star does and i'm not sure if kroger does or not but
M:	you know i'm not sure.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. um i have that on my uh computer here and also um i do some work at u t d and uh that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and and already know the you know already know the the software. and um i don't know from my own experience um wordperfect is just so much better than than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have. it may be improved by now but
M:	i know it's a joke but it's still funny
A:	see i even know his name because he's on the news a lot and i never had to watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
M:	
A:	oh okay.
M:	nope i don't.
A:	that's a good idea. we ought to yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i don't know what they're going to do. it's really not my family. it's my fiancee's so i don't i can't say much.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	we better have him do do something. you know educationally.
M:	i think it's possible but it's not a good idea to be a medic and a caretaker.
A:	you know.
M:	golden retriever.
A:	that there's no problem with getting them to do stuff.
M:	how are they?
