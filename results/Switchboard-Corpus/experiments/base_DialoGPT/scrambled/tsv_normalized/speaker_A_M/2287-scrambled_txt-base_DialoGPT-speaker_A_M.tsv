M:	they're coming to the louisville area next week. i'm not sure what part of the city they're going to be in.
A:	my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons and i was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me. and it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. it is real relaxing.
M:	why is the air so cold?
A:	and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
M:	h?
A:	yeah.
M:	and then?
A:	yeah.
M:	you're we've been we.
A:	huh.
M:	you have a lot of work to do in the area.

M:	he nods.
A:	yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one  you know
M:	i like to eat it with my
A:	to to compensate for some of the benefits.
M:	i can make you eat a lot of food uh food.
A:	i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal.
M:	uhh i don't think you understand.
A:	and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit that's just too much to water all at once but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it.

A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
M:	uuhhh how come?
A:	oh really.
M:	no they are not.

M:	it's not like that.
A:	uh-huh.
