M:	...
A:	well i just
M:	so
A:	and they're they're both declawed at least on the the front claws.
M:	i.
A:	uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um yeah we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
M:	it was a joke
A:	oh.
M:	uhuhuh. uhuhuhuh
A:	uh-huh
M:	you know i usually have to check things.
A:	oh is that right? okay.
M:	he's
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm saying that there is a difference between being right and being right.
A:	yeah. well the cardinals i don't know. i think the cowboys probably have a a better team. they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because uh laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all. of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot.
M:	are you a teacher?
A:	right.
M:	they are still a crime though.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't think there
A:	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read. uh and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something.
M:	he had it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm a private school teacher.
A:	i know.
M:	i'm sure i'll find someone to date.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and the worst part is that the majority of the population was in the middle of the city.
A:	uh-huh. oh yeah.
M:	i'd rather just get the p c
A:	uh-huh.
M:	how do you do it?
A:	huh.
M:	umm... i think that's a myth.
A:	right because that would the eight o'clock here.
M:	it is.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm sorry for your loss. i hope you get better soon.
A:	okay.
M:	what about her?
A:	in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on in the street.
M:	
A:	yeah sure
M:	i think he was a dog he was the most loving the most obedient cat i ever had.
A:	so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. so it's i don't know. it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a
M:	that's what i thought.
A:	in fact i am at work right now. uh and so let me take the lead uh angela. uh i think what is really important uh of course salary is very important because that's why you are working for your for the money but job satisfaction to me is also uh very important in having a job. and uh one of the things that uh she asked us to discuss was benefits. uh i'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
M:	it's
A:	oh.
M:	are you sure you are a middle school girl?
A:	oh well yeah
M:	uhhh. i don't think so.
A:	so she didn't have to be transported back and forth. so she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well. it's not her favorite place to be in. she'd much rather be here with me. but when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her
M:	no. i want to see the eggs hatch
A:	so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. right now we're trying to avoid it but we just as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him. uh i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home.
M:	yes.and.you.can.watch.all.of.the.the.
A:	oh and you've always  lived in texas have you?
M:	i do.
A:	of course their seasons are switched.
M:	new york
A:	i don't know. yeah our leaves are are all on on the ground now. i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
M:	...
A:	right. yeah that would be a real good motivation for people.
M:	i know
M:	yeah i know.
