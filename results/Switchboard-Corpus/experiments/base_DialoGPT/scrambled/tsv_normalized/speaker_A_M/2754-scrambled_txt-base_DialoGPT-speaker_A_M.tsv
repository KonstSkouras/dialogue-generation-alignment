A:	yeah, i think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
M:	the.
A:	yeah.
M:	the only way i can be sure

M:	you mean that was real?
A:	my word.
M:	that's a good thing, though.
A:	uh-huh. yeah but, you know, we do everything together.
M:	i think he's a sociopath.
A:	oh, i see.
M:	no.
A:	i know where you mean. there is a mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner, that's about lookout there, i think, isn't it.
M:	you know, it's only been a day.
A:	there, there's a guy, have you ever heard of george winston, he plays piano.
M:	u.
A:	uh-huh. because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe, uh, they've increased funding for the peace corps. some of the, i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known,
M:	uhh
A:	and, you know, and it's, i think it just benefits you all around. so.
M:	that's the catholic version of it, not the catholian version.
A:	well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.
M:	what? i'm just saying, i've never had a cat that was just that.
A:	do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work?
M:	if the solution to any of these problems is to give the death penalty, then it's not going to work.
A:	yeah.
M:	that's really, really sad.
A:	right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country

M:	what is that?
A:	yeah.
M:	um.
A:	yeah. and the time that my, we spent with our dad was, he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time. so that's how we spent most of the time with him.

M:	...
A:	yeah.
M:	you're the best.
A:	uh, got kids?
M:	you can't be serious.
A:	it when it's uh it's an emotional issue, and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing, uh but logically um even you know for instance, the pro life pro choice movement, uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion, but they would vote pro choice.
M:	uhh, they can just use a certain type that they have a lot of money to buy.
A:	yeah, i know,
M:	...

A:	the ,
M:	no, he didn't. he was arrested.
A:	well, when i was, you know, when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time, and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible. but now they have like this, you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
M:	do you?
A:	somehow i just think, you know, i like the idea
M:	well, i agree with you, but i can see it
A:	uh-huh. exactly. and i don't think, uh, it's ended up being, i mean it gave people jobs
M:	yup, that's what i said.
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	yes, but i'm not the one who is getting insurance.
A:	and i'm, i, that's fine with me. my fiancee and i both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever. if you know what i mean? we feel like, it's our responsibility,
M:	oh, well, yeah, i guess that's interesting
A:	huh.
M:	you do you, ummm, have you tried any other hobby?
A:	we live, uh, we lived in minneapolis for about five years.
M:	uhhh, uh, uh...
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	well, she is a german shepherd.
A:	we are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left. and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home, so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.
M:	oh, uh, it was last year.
A:	and spanish is,  pretty close to english, really.
M:	i, uh, we're gonna build a wall, and i, uh...
A:	okay.
M:	um. i don't do that often.
A:	right.
M:	i'm from the uk.
A:	so ugly she's cute, right.
M:	i'm so glad you like it.
A:	they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it. now come on, let's be realistic,
M:	that's a theory, not a fact.
A:	what about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.
M:	i don't think you should, but, i
A:	and they,  would be deprived of their mother.
M:	oh, yeah, i know.
A:	yeah.
M:	it's just.
A:	oh, i'm sure it would.
M:	i think the majority of them are, and i like the song, but i don't know if that s a majority.
A:	and so she asks the same questions over and over again. which is not you know, unrealistic.
M:	the people have a right to be free from oppression.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	i'm not sure if i want to go.
A:	i'll have to check it out. i saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie, but,
M:	uhh, what are you going to do, i'm thinking about it.
A:	right, well, practical yes that's,  uh-huh. right and it's cooler i believe, too, when you're driving in,
M:	so you want me to tell you about my dog?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	if the team does well, i'll be glad if we can get a decent amount of experience out of them.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	he's a big guy, he's got a big gun, he can do whatever he wants.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm so confused.
A:	yeah, they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
M:	
A:	it's not unique,
M:	did you really?
M:	you know, he's like, uh, not really.
