A:	no no.
M:	yeah.yeah.yep.yep
A:	that's right. i'm not even really sure at this point in time you know what what programs are out there.
M:	i remember seeing her in a movie and i remember she was like... a little over a year old.
A:	uh
M:	i agree
A:	they don't look a thing a like
M:	it's a good thing.
A:	yeah.
M:	the kids are the best feeders.
A:	well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
M:	don't you mean the game?
A:	i mean we are all different so
M:	i do not eat at restaurants.
A:	but they at at the t i there i said is there any area i should avoid. and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think of any place where dana shouldn't go by herself or anything. and she she thought for a few minutes and she said no. and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. she said no. and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
M:	... and then
A:	uh-huh.   uh-huh.   right any   on the street no i know.  uh-huh.  yeah and texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from from killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
M:	uuhuhuh.
A:	so maybe you would
M:	what do you mean?
A:	yeah.
M:	no i don t.
A:	they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
M:	i'm sorry?
A:	um the area itself uh the fort worth dallas area um has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including texas instruments
M:	who's the team?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and uh we're planting
A:	you all equated the family reunions as  with the protestant.
M:	social studies
A:	uh-huh.
M:	
A:	but yeah. but it that's uh that's what i mean see but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response. i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just aren't you know
M:	you're in the district right?
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	... why is he in a relationship?
A:	yes uh-huh.
M:	i think she's going to have to make a joke about that first i think
A:	so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe.
M:	i'm serious. i'm pretty sure that there are a lot more of those people in the legal system than you think.
A:	i went well i did work um just very for some time but i didn't make enough money to really make  too much of a difference.
M:	i like
A:	what's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college
M:	i'm not sure.
A:	so what are your thoughts on dining out?
M:	why do you think that?
A:	and you also get a lot of uh juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know it's just a big faceless corporation. let's let's make them pay as much as possible. things like that.
M:	
A:	oh i didn't know that.
M:	
A:	well i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north and that was a no no.
M:	the rams chiefs and the chiefs have all won super bowls.
A:	my husband has taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does.
M:	i'm reading
A:	no regardless of that fact. it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little autocross racing uh closed circuit racing
M:	you can't.
A:	made me stop and think a minute about not worrying so much about the middle east crisis.
M:	...
A:	i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody
M:	i remember when they won the super bowl.
A:	yeah.  yeah. right. uh and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
M:	and i'm not gonna leave
A:	they they just started trying to get them something together like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently.
M:	hmmm... i'll have
A:	uh-huh. sure. makes uh makes a colorful salad too.
M:	what are you doing for a week?
A:	but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us
M:	do you work in a basement?
A:	but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the peace corps could go in and rescue those people and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
M:	uhhh you know i'm a human.
A:	most everybody i've been talking to is from texas but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of pennsylvania.
M:	oh like.
