A:	wow yeah.
M:	ohio. i've lived in the up since i was in high school.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	there's no reason to be scared.
A:	and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program. i think it was one of kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal.
M:	hm yeah.
A:	um but it's a beautiful home and i mean my brother lives
M:	i'm going to be there but i'm not going to
A:	i think i i now i think people generally volunteer.
M:	it was nice meeting you too
A:	yeah. well it's that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on america stands on is that they can do that uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh you know but i i still what the flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh
M:	why do you hate free?
A:	okay okay. because i i had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes but i didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
M:	yes i'm a student.
A:	there's uh maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
M:	i think you mean like you have to be a volunteer for the school not a community member
A:	and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you you know this is nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a i might be too cold too but they flip a switch
M:	uhhh i know i'm just gonna go sit in my chair and wait for the next one.
A:	well my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet.

M:	so you want me to give you a clue?
A:	do you have a lawn?
M:	i'm not from europe.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	i don't like the shape of that.
A:	right. right. um i think i i've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad
M:	yes.it.is.that
A:	oh yeah.
