A:	yeah
M:	heh, heh.
A:	that's incredible.
M:	wouldn't that be a bit of a problem for a dog?
A:	and, you know, but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day, they split it
M:	i love them, but they are too short for me
A:	right.
M:	golden retriever
A:	yeah.
M:	she nods.
A:	okay. hey, thanks so much for the conversation.
M:	you are correct. i'm not
A:	really.
M:	what
A:	oh
M:	...
A:	no.
M:	i'm so you're not uh, and uh, we can you're
A:	yeah.
M:	
A:	i can believe that. well, it's, it's been interesting.
M:	i'm the one who goes alone.
A:	there's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. we've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation
M:	well, you've certainly got me there.
A:	yeah,  yeah, well neither can i, so, i, i, i, i, i, i, did my service before and i'll do my little community service throughout, but never  never for a year again.
M:	what's the matter?
A:	yeah.
M:	i hate to say it,
A:	uh, a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know?
M:	what is the name of the coach?
A:	yes. yes, yes. i just, i love that, all those, that two hours
M:	i like the look of it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know?
A:	kind of scary when you think about that.
M:	
A:	and, uh, uh, i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
M:	um... i think we can get them out of here.
A:	but, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.
M:	yes,
A:	right.
M:	
A:	yeah, yeah, and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in baltimore that, uh, have and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust, and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.
M:	it's... it's...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you, uh, don't, have, uh...
A:	yeah.
M:	it is.
A:	uh, i used to do that a lot and then i like, um, we have a new child that will be a year old here next week, so i'll take a lot of pictures of her, you know, and spoil them,
M:	why? what is the reason?
A:	okay. and so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. and, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
M:	well, you know
A:	yeah, right that's i think that's the only thing that's going to change it.
M:	yeah, my wife, uh, likes that.
A:	huh.
M:	uhh, we've never done it
A:	well, in the last two years, i have not played very much golf because i am involved in boy scouts.
M:	
A:	so what kind do you, uh, get?
M:	i'm pretty sure that's a joke.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	that's what i'm saying, the prices are usually higher than the cost of the game.
A:	well, that's it. last year, i think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in january, and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it, and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until i think it was may or something
M:	right.
A:	yes, yeah, we had summer lasting long and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.
M:	i'ed you
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that, i mean, they really are over,  crowded,
M:	i, uh, i have, uh... i have two kids...
A:	so, that's why i do that.
M:	i was in the middle of the bus at the end of my shift, there was a problem with german
A:	hit the bags.
M:	yeah, i do.
A:	right.
M:	do we?
A:	huh.
M:	well, i guess i'm gonna go find some more garbage to pick up.
A:	yeah, i mean it, it was really exciting, growing up when, when the cowboys were really big. because my parents would always have season tickets, and they'd go to all the games, and you know, the hype were just unbelievable. it's just, you know, the last, oh i guess probably since about eighty-four, about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really, but, you know, i'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys, cowboys, cowboys, and, you know, super bowl, and all this other stuff. so, i can't, you know, i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. i mean, i think they'll pull out of it, and, you know, they'll, they'll wind up being good again. they've got some, lot of really good young players that are going to, that are going to, uh, do pretty good, i think. but, they're raising prices on their tickets. so they're banking on doing good next season. i think tickets are,
M:	because of the cats
A:	oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.
M:	i mean, if you want to, sure.
A:	oh, yeah, i'd do it, i'd use it for both. the nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
M:	and he's a very nice guy.
A:	and, uh, it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know, browbeat the jury,  a majority, in the, of the, a majority of the jury,
M:	this is weird.
A:	you know, that's, that's totally out.
M:	how would it work?
A:	huh.
M:	you don't know how it works?
A:	and they're being put in the middle of the city
M:	you, i, i speak english,
A:	it was good talking to you.
M:	i'm not the only one who thinks this, uh, is it just me or is it
A:	well, i do, too, i do, too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. but then we started thinking, especially in plano, the weather is so hot in august, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
M:	why do they have so many kids?
A:	yeah, that's good. well, one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff, i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
M:	i'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, what's up?
A:	well, basically, yeah i had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. i mean uh, because i was in a, in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that, uh, i needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel,
M:	you know what? i'm not gonna say anything.
A:	so his solution was to burn plastic. collect it and burn it.
M:	she's a nurse.
A:	that is when she did, i think.
M:	well, i would have to get the right sort of person to do it.
A:	well, that's a great idea, that's a great idea.
M:	you.
A:	precious and rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like. nothing. precious is a medium hair yellow cat,
M:	what do you do for a living?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you, what, you, do.
A:	huh.
M:	this.
A:	okay. so we're in garland.
M:	i think, uh, i'll try to get out of the house and spend some time with her.
A:	yeah.
M:	you know what?
A:	oh, well, that's great, that's great.
M:	it's still a lot better than the community.
A:	right, right.
M:	well, they're not wrong.
A:	but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here, i like the sports, i play a lot of racquetball.
M:	i.
A:	but not all country. i don't like that, when they start,
M:	... i'm so sorry.
A:	there's a lot of folks, probably, that are in prison that, uh, that aren't really a danger to society, huh, and, uh,
M:	i don't know, i just think they are interesting.
A:	no.
M:	they're both the same, right?
A:	but, i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
M:	i've never heard that before. i'll have to check it out.
A:	right. just get you away from the everyday things that are going on. we, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, delaware along the ocean most every year. and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
M:	because people don't know.
A:	yeah.
M:	i think you should be careful.
A:	yeah.
M:	it's okay. i'll give you a safe
A:	we were in colorado recently and heard this, these, uh, well, we heard this fiddler and we bought his, we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans .
M:	yeah, uh, she's not dead
A:	oh, do they really. curbside pick up?
M:	there are a few shootings in garland and a few in the southside.
A:	bon  yeah.
M:	she is so tiny.
A:	well, yeah, they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
M:	i don't have a bank.
A:	oh, yeah. that's good.  actually,
M:	hi bill.
A:	vision, i guess it's called, vision care.
M:	you.
A:	yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
M:	i've never gone back to the house, i've never been in a car, and i've been away from the house for years.
A:	and wherever they pooped,
M:	i think it's a common practice.
A:	uh-huh. well you kind of know what it's like, then. yeah.
M:	i know
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	you know, you're not wrong.
A:	oh.
M:	that's what the
A:	right.
M:	yep, i'm in the dorms right now.
A:	oh, yeah, they have, uh, uh, what i, what i used to, uh, now that i don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
M:	i'y
A:	it's the same thing that's on the radio, word for word.
M:	i am a european, i feel the same way about american cars.
A:	yeah.
M:	good morning, sir.
A:	yes.
M:	the first thing i thought of was that they are in the middle of a street.
A:	thank you. well, that was one minute. they hung up.
M:	you guys have a pretty good defense, i think we can get a td.
A:	well well, like, um, well, i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
M:	... i have no idea what that is.
A:	this is gross.
M:	oh. well.
A:	yeah, it's, you know, it's a pain to clean but, you know, we used to, i mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans . they didn't,
M:	yeah, i know.
A:	it's still in existence.
M:	i'm in the middle of pennsylvania.
A:	that's sweet, i have the two, the other two cats i have are outdoor cats.
M:	sorry. i just wanted to say, i have a feeling that the others are the same as me.
A:	i mean, supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you.
M:	i
A:	true.
M:	we'll be there in september, i think.
A:	but, um, i, my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.
M:	that's a very interesting idea.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, i could.
A:	and, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?
M:	she smiles and puts her hands on her hips
A:	but, they're fun.
M:	well, you have to be a fan of the band to buy the pieces
A:	i know so, i felt kind of sorry for him. that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but, um, i never , a major owner of our of the team here.
M:	i'm fine with that
