A:	uh-huh. you'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area.
M:	you the...
A:	oh gee.
M:	yeah it's a good thing i find it odd that some people are against healthcare in general.
A:	our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported.
M:	... i'm a girl.
A:	oh yeah.
M:	what.
A:	right.
M:	
A:	the legend. uh.
M:	then
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but... we did draw up our budget...
A:	yeah.
M:	i'll take the free kitten
A:	and my husband and i actually met in a computer company. um i was a tech writer and he was an engineer. and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years.
M:	yeah. i think it's really 
A:	is that suppose to be.
M:	oh i see. so she was in high school
A:	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
M:	we are all in the same place right?
A:	oh no i mean this whole thing like for two months or something do you know?
M:	...
A:	and we would have to we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and that's a good family place to go
M:	i don't think i've ever had a cup of water in a bath.
A:	no that's okay
M:	what do you think?
A:	probably so. yeah you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	i'm not gonna lie i cried.
A:	yeah and they're they're very expensive too. .
M:	i
A:	and uh i thought austin was beautiful
M:	oh i'm in durham.
A:	um to don't adam talking to um city
M:	it's white paper.
A:	but i
M:	we've been to every summer since we were kids.
A:	uh what are you thinking about buying?
M:	...
A:	true true.
M:	
A:	that's right.
M:	i like it.
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	it's is uh is
A:	and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
M:	it's a little more of a chore.but i'm trying to get out of it
A:	and somebody will turn it in and and nothing will be missing. they said they can just about guarantee that there that that would happen if you did that. i thought boy in america if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again.
M:	i'm not the one who owns the house.
A:	and so
M:	it's just it's.
A:	watch me.
M:	but i like it.
A:	so we had to we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath and uh get him cleaned up
M:	you know i never said i was.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean it's just a bit of fun.
A:	yeah. really.
M:	i would be shocked if they did. they could easily make it a policy.
A:	yes.
M:	they haven't even made a film of it.
A:	yeah keep it there
M:	
A:	uh in parts. i mean you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room.
M:	i think i know.
A:	i i'm serious. and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. with plea bargaining.
M:	i'm not sure. i don't know.
A:	and uh i would go out and call on farmers and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
M:	you don't think?
A:	uh not too much. uh i got a bit. actually
M:	you know that.
A:	we had about a little bit less than two weeks.
M:	?
A:	uh-huh. well they they just don't do that any more.
M:	so what do we do now?
A:	that don't it  it it seems like i mean if wrestling is prime time professional wrestling it seems like it's just just just like pros in a wrestling to me i don't i don't see any difference though
M:	hm? i don't understand.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	they should just release it on the 14th.
A:	and he's you know a lot of wisdom in it. and the kids at bible talk about anything but training and training is different than anything else in in psychology doesn't address it. a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the bible and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
M:	uhh it's a cadillac
A:	that will be interesting.
M:	it's a german shepherd so it's a breed.
A:	and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home
M:	...
A:	yeah.
M:	are you serious?
A:	that would be really great.
M:	what is that?
A:	and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now.
M:	i don't think they can be a'school '
A:	no they're just mutts
M:	i don't i don t i'm just here to help.
A:	most of the time
M:	you can't even get rid off the bears in the wild.
A:	is that right? that's it?
M:	i know.
A:	but she got credits for it?
M:	yes but you can't have a skunky.
A:	oh that's my husband's into uh computers.
M:	yeah i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i
A:	you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever. and i know that that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with uh feel very quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here. because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically. and they're being plunked down plunked down into america. many of them had been promised by the c i a during the war over there that because they co-operated with the c i a and they helped the c i a out that when they came here the c i a would help establish them in america and the c i a of course isn't doing that.
M:	
A:	uh i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment. most people in this country are getting worse off not better off.
M:	yeah?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's a lot of fun
A:	huh.

M:	so you're saying you don't like it?
A:	yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	i'm not sure i think they were like three fifty.
A:	anyway it's a tough question.
M:	he smiles and smiles back
A:	sure.
M:	it's called being a judge.
A:	who wrote that?
M:	ummm... how do you make soup?
A:	um. boy i like that.
M:	did you read it?
A:	yeah it's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that's like a ku klux klan member something got elected.
M:	yes then a is and and?
A:	no i've done some walking with friends in the past.
M:	uhh uh they're all over the place.
A:	yeah that must have been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks
M:	
A:	yeah ours is on
M:	thanks
A:	well i think it's interesting to look at uh where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government
M:	it's a joke
A:	and they don't look at it so much as you know
M:	
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i

M:	well i'm sure that's why i'm still in school.
A:	and uh yeah i was amazed. really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality. i don't know i can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog so.
M:	i have a bit i'
A:	and uh.
M:	
A:	uh-huh.  yeah.
M:	uh we have a lot of flowers we just don't have the time to plant them
