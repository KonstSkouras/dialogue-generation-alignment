M:	oh. uh. he was there.
A:	and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property and it would make you ill to see this.

A:	well and that's an individual thing.
M:	why would you?
A:	well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
M:	i read that.
A:	and they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
