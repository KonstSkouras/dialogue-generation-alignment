M:	what?
A:	uh-huh. i've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, but that takes time, that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
M:	oh, i see. i was thinking that the money would be the same as the money that doctors make.
A:	you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v but you probably wouldn't.
M:	it's a joke.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'd say the same thing about a super salary.

A:	uh-huh.
M:	you're right,
A:	oh, you're kidding well, do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there, i mean, what it's,

A:	and it was just, uh, amazing to me, and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,  and being rearrested an.
M:	he smiles and shrugs
A:	if, if, if i had the car i wanted.
M:	
A:	and so, one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
M:	i'm not sure that's
A:	oh, so you've heard the richardson symphony?

M:	uhh, i don't know what you're talking about.
A:	more, more, i can understand that, that's probably what i would, uh,
M:	...
A:	yeah, probably, i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid, in fact,
M:	i'm just not really interested in any of that.
A:	oh.
M:	you know what's small?
A:	yeah.
M:	that's what i said.
A:	yes, and that's, that's one thing i do have.
M:	
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
M:	i'm
A:	and i did it, um, for one reason i wanted, i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree, but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
M:	i think it's bad, because it's not even bad.
A:	yeah.
M:	yes, it is.
A:	is she the oldest one?

A:	you want to,  yeah. they'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters and then, i think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so that will probably help out.
M:	oh. uh... i guess that makes sense.
