A:	and she is charging out of her mind already. and i'm going you just got off. that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person
M:	she's so she's just fine.
A:	oh.
M:	are you in the us?
A:	so
M:	the award is the amount of money
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	.
A:	but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
M:	it's u i am the law i know.
A:	yeah.
M:	see you around.
A:	yeah well i i i don't know i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because uh you know there's the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get you know
M:	she's not.
A:	that yes. i i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasn't
M:	what's going on here?
A:	they're always always happy. i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy.
M:	that's what they said but it's because they don't have a problem
A:	yeah uh i'm in uh new york.
M:	
A:	um.
M:	it's a good motivation. i'll be doing it again soon.
A:	and i was by myself in china too.
M:	i i you you' read.
A:	right.
M:	and i'm not sure if you are aware of the fact that they didn't allow it.
A:	uh-huh. right. i agree with that i agree with that. but i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn
M:	i think you're misunderstanding the question.
A:	uh-huh. do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? will they make it through the summer sun?
M:	i think it's a good thing.
A:	and um so and we're on the colder side they're on the rainy side we're on the snowy side and um we we ski. my my children all ski
M:	i'm not sure what you're trying to say.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i didn't feel anything
A:	yeah. but it's funny that uh i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania. i'm not even sure of that but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that. and it surprised and even florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
M:	yep.
A:	not this past fall but i mean fall a few years i mean it it was in the yeah it was almost like october of eighty-five
M:	it's not it's just it is.
A:	right.
M:	is that the place in the middle of the picture?
A:	so you're you're not that far north then okay.
M:	i can't help but read this in the voice of the dude who's been trying to convince everyone he's a vampire.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	how about you?
A:	well that
M:	i guess that's one way to do it.
A:	yeah.
M:	wait what?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so are you saying that they are going to be rehabilitated?
A:	that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place and it affects
M:	they are all friends with the same person.
A:	but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out  i think every human does i think they'd say yeah
M:	i'm a girl.
A:	and the only other avenue that i can think of is uh looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. as for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars.
M:	some of them are just going to be on the internet forever.
A:	we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the horses in central park.
M:	oh uh i've got a paper bag.
A:	yeah
M:	it's a nice place to live.
A:	yeah.  i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people. usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money  but  the the places like presbyterian village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting.
M:	uhhh i would be hung up on the lincoln.
A:	um.
M:	we got the first pick in the nfc east and then we got a qb that wasn't even the first overall pick.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	
A:	i found that out. i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when i went in to and asked and that was a requirement so
M:	
A:	i don't know
M:	well the car was designed for air pollution so no it's probably not a good design.
A:	at any rate we came back here with my husband was transferred around uh up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i
M:	you uh might want to check your math.
A:	they just say do you believe in such and such. uh
M:	uuhuh. uhuh.
A:	yeah. we have some of them around here. you probably have more there though i would imagine.
M:	how did you learn uh.learn?
A:	thirty day notice for what?
M:	i'm sorry
A:	oh.
M:	i hate rain.
A:	yeah.
M:	i uh know.
A:	i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
M:	yes.
A:	i know i love mine too. well it's been nice talking to you.
M:	i love running i love exercise i'm a runner i just like running.
A:	now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
M:	no not family
A:	and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
M:	but we're not in the uk
A:	uh-huh. it sure is. the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences. they were using it as eating out uh when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
M:	is it just bad?
A:	i know and uh the police are not going to do anything until they they've committed some sort of a crime. you know he was just begging her on the phone that's not doing anything.
M:	that sounds good.
A:	oh gosh chris xeros you grew up with his children too then?
M:	i don't know it's been a while since we've had a big problem with it.
A:	uh oh of course of course they are. they want you to buy their car. yeah there it was it was interesting. i was at i i also went to uh the porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
M:	i
A:	the i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean i'm learning and stuff because  i'm at you know in school.
M:	you
A:	yes.
M:	then that and?
A:	and uh i've got carrots i yes i've got a few carrots up and i've got some radishes up
M:	i dunno.
A:	and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would have probably like you said to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country i think it would have been a very good um experience for me.
M:	i don't think you can use the gun with a gun in it.
A:	um i have no idea.
M:	and that's why i don'think it's going to fix anything
A:	but .  that is a very good point. i am from west virginia so i understand what you are saying there
M:	oh. well i guess you're right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's like a real life version of a movie.
A:	and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in.
M:	com
M:	uhhh what?
