M:	it's a business.
A:	well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh

A:	makes a lot of difference.
M:	i'm a lot of fun.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	what is your major crime?
A:	i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite they say they're uh remarkably incompetent. and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that.
M:	i
A:	and then where do you meet?
M:	uuhh uuhh.
A:	they're up and doing fine.
M:	you.
A:	right.

M:	yeah keep it
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we have a decent number of people from utah
A:	oh okay my my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't
M:	i love stick shift.
A:	you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
M:	
A:	yes. and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
M:	how much would it cost?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	that's what i was thinking.
A:	that's uh only way to do it.
M:	she laughs. what do you mean then?
A:	i guess baby-sitters now are up at what five dollars an hour?
M:	no huhuhuhuhuuhuh
A:	right.
M:	the
A:	huh-uh.
M:	that's a good point. i just wanted to point out that a lot of people aren't even aware of the fact that they can get up to five dollars.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	is that a serious problem?
A:	just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else
M:	so you agree with that.
M:	you guys ever have a fight in the middle of the night?
