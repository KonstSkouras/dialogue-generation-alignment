B:	right. so, i think we find out what's happening in the city, uh, on a fairly frequent basis, over a, over a gin and tonic sort of thing.
M:	i'm not saying it's impossible, i'm just saying that it's not a simple matter of how many times we say it.

B:	just started shooting people,  because they botched the first job
M:	yes, but it's mostly for the camping.
B:	we don't use the radio as a wake up, we have our, a television connected to a, uh, uh, electronic alarm, uh, system that kicks in,
M:	well, we have a camp.
B:	right. oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.

M:	that's a weird way to spell me
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah. i guess it's okay.
B:	i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so, i really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	i think you have to have been married a year or two before this
B:	yeah, yeah.

M:	i can't.
B:	and then we would turn the television off and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on, on news that way. and, then we would do a similar thing, uh, at uh, ten forty-five because, uh, c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up and then we would get the local coverage, uh, and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would, would have better state coverage rather than local coverage. uh, three of the networks here, on their local news, uh, that if, if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who, murdered who, or stole what. from whom.
