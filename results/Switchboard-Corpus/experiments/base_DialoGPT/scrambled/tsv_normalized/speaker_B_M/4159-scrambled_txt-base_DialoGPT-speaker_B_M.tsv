B:	yes, yes. i agree.
M:	you know, i have a lot of friends.
B:	so you think that would be a deterrent?
M:	ah, so it was.
B:	uh, my home is, well, is typical for the area. i live in a development, uh, it's a relatively, i would say, well, god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging
M:	i've been sorry
B:	and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but i think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it. so, you know,
M:	maybe you can make a list of all the things that have been done in the past?
B:	so again, it never really penalizes,  the company doing the wrong.

M:	i think.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	you know
B:	remember jim hart? jim hart was playing. terry metcalf was on the cardinals. this was a long time ago.
M:	i mean, you could just sit around, they don't have to pay you
B:	i really don't watch that much t v, what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch, and then on the nights i can watch, i'll pick out something.
M:	i'm not
B:	but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
M:	what?
B:	well flower gardens. i like to have, matter of fact this past weekend i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. so, those ought to be coming up around spring time
M:	i don't.
B:	well let me ask you this then.
M:	
B:	uh-huh yeah, i really do, because i like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.

B:	really?
M:	i know, but it's on the computer in my room.
B:	the petroleum pretty much, i mean, those petroleum products i think are the big, uh, you know the great satan of the recycling.
M:	oh, i'm not the only one.
B:	i know, and i think, i think that's ridiculous.
M:	the most interesting thing about me is that i have never been on acid.
B:	you know. because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know. i don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of a company situation.
M:	but, uh, you don't have to say that.
B:	um, i'm twenty.
M:	it's been forever.
B:	but, i'm not, i'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
