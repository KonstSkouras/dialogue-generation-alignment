M:	well, you can't, i'll, i'm.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	ya, it is.
B:	you can't get away from it so i think, to some point,

M:	to be fair, i don't have a choice. i can get up at any time.
B:	um.
M:	oh. you're, uh, not, that's weird.
B:	uh, and, you know, like i said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.

B:	yeah. and she still likes to get time which i've never liked very much
M:	you.
B:	well, anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i, you know, happen to gather up.
M:	you can't have a flag and a freedom.
B:	yeah.  but,
M:	
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. i, i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
M:	i'd love to see a picture of a glass window.
B:	right, i'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked.

B:	really.
M:	the, uh, you know, night program?
B:	uh, uh-huh.
