B:	but all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	so... would that make it a good idea?
B:	but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	colorado, but i think it's colorado.

M:	oh, okay.
B:	well, i think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it. because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, i bought this out of state. i need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.
