B:	i'm i'm with the n r a myself.
M:	we have a principal that has a gun and he shoots people
B:	some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when i found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there, and i know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. put lights and stuff
M:	i don't know, but i can tell you that they're all over the place in the ghetto.

B:	well, i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know, who would see it.
M:	it's a bit of a dilemma.
B:	well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science

M:	no, it's, you, that, you're.
B:	so i think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.

M:	he's not a cook.
B:	yeah. and, uh, if i couldn't have my luxury maxima then i'd buy me a fancy little red c r x sports car
M:	well, we are not in pennsylvania.
B:	there probably are, you know, for but i'm sure, that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know, and i'm not saying just give them money but, i mean, because they have to be taught to be,
