B:	yeah, we have, we have two children that live in pittsburgh
M:	i
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	you mean to say what?
B:	but, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a family family thing. you know, one of those hell family vacations.
M:	so this is a golden
B:	but, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
M:	i'm sure they'll love it
B:	and, and, and, uh, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in,  that it's an ingredient,
M:	you can type on the computer?
B:	i mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all i have is boys, so that's all i'm around basically, is boys,
M:	well, if they are guilty, they are not bad people.
B:	maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system.
M:	because they're volunteers.
B:	well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method, have you had any former suzuki students?
M:	that's what i said.
B:	yep.
M:	uhh, i know a man that upgrades.
B:	it's real hard to rate something like that.
M:	huh. huh.
B:	oh, no, uh-huh. they always had a paddle in our school.
M:	i think you have it backwards.
B:	oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats.
M:	i think they did have a garage.
B:	no, it is not. it's lopsided, very much so.
M:	what's wrong with being a fan of the school?
B:	it seems like they would be able to.
M:	i think i might be able to find them in the back of my mind if i look around.
B:	and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
M:	do you think that the us is the only country that does that?
B:	uh, for the, and so, you, on that it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,
M:	you feel stupid for doing that.
B:	but, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?
M:	he's not that good
B:	oh, uh-huh. yeah, i, i like some of his songs, though. they're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. they're just kind of sweet sometimes.
M:	so. uh
B:	well you lived in france,
M:	you?
B:	no, huh-uh. no we don't.
M:	he's a good guy. he's a real human being.
B:	oh well he lived through it, oh, i couldn't believe it. we went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
M:	oh, i'm sure. you like to
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i, i'm...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i like
B:	if it's a company, you know that they're insured. unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages,
M:	i know, but you can have a junk and a bath together
B:	huh-uh.
M:	why are you saying that?
B:	right, right.
M:	you know, we all have our hobbies.
B:	so it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
M:	i know.that's why i said it.
B:	right.
M:	i
B:	you're still trying to dry out?
M:	he smiles
B:	yes
M:	...
B:	um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but, uh, i don't know if, you know, the, it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. there, there's still a big question in my mind that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing, is something that still bothers me.
M:	i have to make some of those plants and tomatoes.
B:	i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game. i rarely go but we went last year because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
M:	yeah, but they'll have time to finish the race.
B:	and, and that should be first and, and children second. but they don't have kind of an, what we call an internal perspective of things.
M:	i'm not sure i'd ever buy a used vehicle, especially a used one.
B:	i think in the next session they they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh florida.
M:	i know, right?
B:	i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
M:	they do.
B:	that, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
M:	who are you?
B:	so, i guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn and,
M:	i'd say the most likely scenario is that they
B:	um.
M:	are you from seattle?
B:	you know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, uh, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.
M:	seattle, wa.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's fun
B:	oh, yeah. yeah, i enjoy it. i come home from work and, and i usually say hello to wife and kids, and then go out and fiddle, you know, just walk around the yard and inspect it
M:	you wanna see
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
M:	high? no.
