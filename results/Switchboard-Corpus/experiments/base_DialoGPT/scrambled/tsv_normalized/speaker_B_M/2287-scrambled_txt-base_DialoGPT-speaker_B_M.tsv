B:	i think so, and a lot, i think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know. i'm in the south, but i don't live near any towns.

B:	uh-huh.
M:	they've been, uh, uh.
B:	so, we used to go and listen to them all the time and, my parents still do.
M:	i think it's the most fun, the most interesting, and the least spoiled
B:	see, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
M:	my
B:	and, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
M:	i don't, uh, know, what, uh
B:	no, no, no. i generally would uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, i listen to k c b i a lot but i will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work.
M:	how did they get that?
B:	and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances
M:	i've got it.
B:	oh, uh-huh.
M:	what?
B:	and that may impact it as well.
M:	huh? where do you work?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but
B:	oh, uh-huh.
M:	that's pretty cool.
B:	uh it is to a certain extent
M:	uh, they?
B:	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing, where there are more than one family in a house. and with the, uh, people that are coming into the country from other countries, not knowing the language
M:	but he's just a normal guy, not crazy.
B:	no.
M:	i, uh, yeah, yeah
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yes.
B:	some, i don't even, i recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot, but i didn't recognize the name.
M:	
B:	oh, boy.
M:	i don't know.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know what that is, so i guess not.
B:	oh, that's okay.
M:	you know, for the mostly non native american, you have a few plants in your home, right?
B:	oh you're adventurous. you went by yourself.
M:	i'm, like... a dump, like, dump, dump.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	oh. so.
B:	right.
M:	oh, that's a good idea.
B:	cambodians, uh, asians, vietnamese. we, we're getting a lot of, uh, mexican americans, you know, we've had,  those for a long time.
M:	i don't think so.
B:	oh.
M:	i'm sorry, but it's so nice to be warm.
B:	yeah.
M:	yeah, i can't even look.
B:	what do you think?
M:	ya....
B:	yeah, well i never i had to work for him and i never would want to work for him. so
M:	eye care.
B:	i know, i, you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible
M:	oh. you're walking
B:	no.
M:	you can't really save the money, you can only borrow it.
B:	right. that's true. yeah, well, it, it, you know, you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,  done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,
M:	i
B:	uh, not if it's done fairly. and that's probably my question is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.

B:	i know, in, in the dallas metroplex area, i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself
M:	i was so close to feeling bad for them.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	well. it was a while ago.
B:	oh, close to five minutes, i believe.
M:	well, if you can afford it, i think you can handle a little.
B:	yeah. and then, i was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because i had forgotten, i guess, that i wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.
M:	is it a problem?
B:	but it gets to the point where, i mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.
M:	i live in texas and i'm so confused.
B:	yeah, he's a pretty nice guy.
M:	yeah, that's why i'm confused.
B:	oh really.
M:	i didn't, uh
B:	uh, she goes to a home. this is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from china early in, in their lives.

B:	yeah.
M:	you can't.
B:	t-, whether my dentist or
M:	so, how's your wife?
B:	yeah.
M:	what's a baby?
B:	so it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
M:	
B:	it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
M:	he was a little bit out of breath.
B:	i thought that was on the upswing again now.
M:	i mean, it's not like anyone is going to do something about it.
B:	that sounds wonderful.
