M:	he's a little short for me, but i'm not a big fan of him.
B:	so you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price. and i mean good, i would, let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. and probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.
M:	i think you are talking about the military.
B:	oh, i see.
M:	not really, we are just in a big city. i'm in the suburbs.

M:	i don't know, but i'm pretty sure they were.
B:	but, i think people try to, on, on t v i think, they try to throw in good stuff, but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.
M:	i was not talking about that, i was talking
B:	well, they might tell you it's random.
M:	what do you do for a living?
B:	i've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe christmas.
M:	i'm a student

B:	and
M:	you know
B:	i can imagine, my lord.
M:	what do you think?

B:	i, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it
M:	we've got 3.5 billion people.
B:	i thought they were moving to new jersey this is how much i know about baseball.
M:	i

B:	something,
M:	i'm just going to assume you mean in the city,
B:	and i'm okay. but when it gets too hot, then it's, that, i don't like that

B:	but, um, he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet.
M:	it's a cute dog.
B:	uh-huh. if it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live.
M:	and you had a pontiac aztek in the 80's.
B:	oh. oh, that's nice, i, this is different for us because the other, in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks, and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees, and we do miss that. um, if we had a chance to move, i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as, as far as that goes.
M:	oh yeah! i remember that!
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but they have, uh, their, uh kids, uh

M:	i do, but not for school.
B:	oh, uh-huh.
M:	we have a water pump, but it's not enough to power our water.
B:	that happens on occasion, it sure does, maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
