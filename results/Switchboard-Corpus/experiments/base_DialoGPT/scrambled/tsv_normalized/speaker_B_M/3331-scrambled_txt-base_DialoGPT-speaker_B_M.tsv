B:	it is. it really is.
M:	... that's a good thing.
B:	no, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
M:	so...
B:	and, uh, we were never much of, uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in vermont or something.
M:	u wot m8
B:	how did, how did they get involved in that?
M:	you can't.
B:	and we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,  whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
M:	i'm from ohio.
B:	right, i, i usually see her a, couple times a year so that's no, no big thing. but, uh, i, uh, i do, i do enjoy the reunions. the only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's
M:	nope, no
B:	uh, that's one thing that they do. at that, it's pretty easy to do.
M:	awwww. my nissan.
B:	but it's, it's so lonely, you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean, it's hard for, for someone like me to understand that
M:	i'm
B:	yeah , mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick, and she said, i don't think he's sick, i think she's pregnant,
M:	i'm gonna get my stuff, and you're gonna get your stuff.
B:	it's just kind of, uh, we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here, uh, which will be, you know, a little bit more typical, uh, autumn weather. but really it's strange. we haven't really had an autumn. it's like we went into winter
M:	i mean, you can be tested.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
M:	what do you mean?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i know, right?
B:	so i really don't worry about anything.
M:	it's a long process.
B:	but i feel closer to them, because i kind of grew up with them. but, but, uh, as, you know, for the rest of that group, no not really.
M:	... i... i'm not sure
B:	okay.
M:	well, there is ethanol in the fuel, so that's why they're doing it.
B:	twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky. i wouldn't do it for that.
M:	i think we're gonna have to get that one started.
B:	no, uh,
M:	oh, uh, grapevine?
B:	yes.
M:	she's beautiful
B:	and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.
M:	it, it's, i know, you, you are, you.
B:	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know, that's,
M:	oh. she could've just typed it out.
B:	and, uh, you know, they had, uh, in fact on the news last night we were watching this, uh, man who lost his ten year old daughter. he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone. now ten years old, she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes, you know.
M:	it's the weight that matters.
B:	and now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are have, uh, have died off, or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.
M:	i'll buy it.
B:	yeah.
M:	i, uh, i, uh... i made the fourth bedroom
