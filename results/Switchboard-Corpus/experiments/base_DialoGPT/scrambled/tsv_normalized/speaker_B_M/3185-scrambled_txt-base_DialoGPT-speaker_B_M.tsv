M:	why would you want to do that?
B:	and we go along and, i'm really not sure how we find the individuals, but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it, and, uh, we go along with all the material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix whatever we can.
