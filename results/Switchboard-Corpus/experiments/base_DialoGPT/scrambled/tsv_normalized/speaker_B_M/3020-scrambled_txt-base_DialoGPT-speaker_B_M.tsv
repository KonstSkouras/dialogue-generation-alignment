M:	you guys were just a bunch of cuddly cuddlys.
B:	i'm surprised. my dad worked for arby's for several years.
M:	football, baseball, and football.

B:	uh-huh.
M:	i was thinking of the future.
B:	and i, so i mean, how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives.
M:	he was in the hospital, so he's probably not too serious
B:	and all of the descendants of the civil war, i mean, yeah, the civil war veterans come together, and they come as far away from california, and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
M:	they're the biggest recruiting program in the state
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
M:	maryland
B:	and, uh and the, yeah, younger one is, uh, uh, the sports one and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite
M:	i live in a place where we can play over here.
B:	but i am going to, to, uh, hopefully next year get to go back, cause, uh, a lot of the family has not, uh, on her side, my mother's side, has not seen, you know, my daughter, so
M:

B:	but, when, during the winter time i think they, they move south or something
M:	heh, what?

M:	what did you do?
B:	i'm serious.
M:	roasted beef?
B:	what about yourself?
M:	well, you can get it for a dollar, so...
B:	and so it's, in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, uh, the you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know, let's say compared to maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
M:	i can start working on it in an hour.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know what to say.it's just something i've noticed.
B:	uh so, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. very limited space waste
M:	what is this, a crossover episode?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	he's a
B:	uh-huh.
M:	are you watching them?
B:	yeah.  yeah.
M:	to, that's, a house
B:	uh, we have fifty acres.
M:	what's the verdict?
B:	that, i had heard that that was better. that was a better one.
M:	i have no idea
B:	uh, right, right. right, right.
M:	what if i told you, i would want to do this for a living.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	i guess you could say it's raining
B:	judge
M:	we did aerobiic stuff together, and we made some really cool stuff
B:	they just overflow.
M:	it
B:	yes, uh-huh.
M:	i
B:	eye care is good. i do not, i am not i do not think we have that on our policy.
M:	i.
B:	and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes, so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, that are more, you know, nonessential items.
M:	oh, we're, we, and it's, you, we've, it, it's
B:	now i am i am adamantly against that.
M:	what? how?
B:	see.
M:	ughololol
B:	no, well, they have it at six and they have it at nine,
M:	you're done?
B:	really?
M:	i'm sorry, i don't understand what you're saying.
B:	we just have the case, i'm, i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry.
M:	the game is a lot faster now.
B:	uh uh, uh, although i do, uh, a lot of,
M:	i think you're right.
B:	but they selectively culled those litters, i mean, for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master, i mean it had, it had to be of a disposition to make it, you know, an animal you could keep around that closely. but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect. now, you know, that seems like a cruel thing to do.
M:	when you say you're a big guy, do you mean you walk or do you walk and do it?
B:	absolutely.
M:	...
B:	uh-huh. yes.
M:	ugh, it's not good.
B:	yeah.
M:	that's a good idea.
B:	i have one and i can not remember the name of it, uh, it is supposed to be a mystery.
M:	i don't.
B:	yeah, it gets kind of, i, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain.
M:	yeah, but the houses were large, so the car was the size of the garage.
B:	yeah. i think some of, is how the, uh, you know, i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.
M:	i've been to the very top of the world and i'm in the very bottom of the earth.
B:	well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.
M:	uh, what?
B:	so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, i'll tell you
M:	i'll be the one who grows.
B:	right.
M:	that is what i get for trying to understand the question.
