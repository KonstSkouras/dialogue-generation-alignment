B:	yeah, so do we.
M:	i'm not saying there's not, uh, there's a lot of people

M:	uhh, i don t know,
B:	no, i don't think there was. um, i know a little bit more from a, a co-worker. her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.

M:	and they just watch, uh, movies
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	hmmm... i'm not sure i'm too far in.
B:	and, you know. uh, and the reason i was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the atlantic, thinking they were flight nineteen. and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's, uh, flight nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two, and they were, they were lost and, uh,
M:	yea.huh.
B:	that's rather interesting.
M:	i'm
B:	so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.
M:	what happened?
B:	and the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing, think a thing about it.
M:	but they are a part of the economy...
B:	although i claim florida as my home now, uh, i have two sons living down there but i also have two sons living elsewhere,  one in tennessee, one in mississippi.
M:	it was

B:	yeah.  yeah.
M:	no, because you don't have a choice.
B:	inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.
M:	you can eat the chicken rice
B:	yeah, well, of course in the, uh, i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
M:	uhh, uh, interesting.
B:	and i ended up getting one that, uh, came out of a, a, a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did.
M:	drug test
B:	i remember food
M:	he's been in power for over a year.
B:	a lexus, uh, s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.
M:	oh yeah? uh huh?
B:	but, uh, i think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places i've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
M:	i'm a bit confused.
B:	well, we're about a hundred miles from pittsburgh north.
M:	he sighs.
B:	the kids, they are real people and they are interesting and, they, they have all their own activities and, um, i think as parents we really enjoy them in, in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel

B:	yeah, exactly.
M:	... and so it wound up.
B:	yeah. maybe, maybe that. yeah.
M:	
B:	i don't either.
M:	no? i had a shrimp
B:	because since i'm an international student, they want to send me back to argentina.
M:	they're all the best, so that's all that matters.
B:	yeah, yeah. well, to some extent if they would do something with some of those people. but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
M:	so uh
B:	do you?
M:	that sounds cool.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, the power company.
B:	uh, the nissan came and, and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get.
M:	i'm.
B:	yeah, she just appeared.
M:	uhhh... uh huh.
B:	yes, we're not too long distance today.
M:	i don't know. i'm just a little confused.
B:	well, it wasn't really. it was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
M:	wait, how?
B:	well, they are, they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog, because i had a retriever, actually i had a retriever irish setter cross. which is a really nice animal
M:	state of the art.
B:	and you've a choice of where you want to go.

B:	a bit
M:	and we've got fifty, you've got ten.
B:	i, i've, one thing, when, when i have run and jogged, uh, i've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that i was having to do, i, i've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, i write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out.  the, it's
M:	and then you have the stigma of prochoice
B:	right, right.
M:	that's what i'm saying.
B:	right.
M:	i, i'm so sorry.
B:	and i, i think there's an attempt to do that. you know, i think people, there's a mild attempt for that, but i think basically, we basically associate news with bad news or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.
M:	yes, i'm, it's.
B:	johnny elway.
M:	i'm a vegetarian.
B:	are you, uh, transit usually? i mean do you stay not in one place too long?
