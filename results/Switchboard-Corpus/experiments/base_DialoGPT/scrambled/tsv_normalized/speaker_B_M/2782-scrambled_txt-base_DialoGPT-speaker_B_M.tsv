M:	i know. they should have been more concerned about the smogginess of the air in the area.
B:	okay.
M:	
B:	so it all comes filtering down to us all individually.
M:	we're from ohio.

B:	i don't know. you know some of the health insurance is written that way. you know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it pre specified in the policy so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a, a value on somebody's limb,  uh, arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.
M:	so, who do you mean?
B:	yeah.
M:	hmmmm
B:	now, it was very nicely done.
M:	but... they can.
B:	but, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. there's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play but that was, i think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.
M:	we were
B:	and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
M:	what? what?
B:	right and the weed come up,
M:	it's been a while since i've seen the giants, but i think they're doing alright.
B:	well, we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict but, budget but, uh, the about and to our, when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just, you know, dirt poor. then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. so, we virtually did that for about two years,  which worked real well, and then moved from california where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved,  and moved to texas, bought a house immediately, you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,
M:	it's the same with all of them, and you just have to say the names.
B:	i was born in l a so i know what you're talking about.  in l a, it's pretty bad.
M:	yeah, i have to go to a restaurant. i'm not sure where i can find it.

M:	what is that?
B:	yeah, i don't understand  that, they, they don't want to be with anybody else.
M:	a lot of them are
B:	you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time, and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,
M:	you.
B:	uh-huh. well that's great. where else have you been?
M:	i can't wait to see what she'll do to me.
B:	and it's kind of split between c m u and,  and, you know, the employee.
