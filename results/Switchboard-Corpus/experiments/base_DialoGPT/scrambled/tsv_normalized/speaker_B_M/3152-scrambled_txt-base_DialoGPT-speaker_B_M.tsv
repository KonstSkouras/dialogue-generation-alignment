B:	and so it wasn't so bad.
M:	what if you're the
B:	uh-huh.
M:	because it costs taxpayers millions in military spending.
B:	oh.
M:	are you sure?
B:	oh, definitely. i think better even than, than other kinds of food
M:	i have never, never, done that.
B:	but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room  and, and eat some good meals.
M:	paper. i know.
B:	so they found a, a place nearby that they put her in last year.
M:	why do you hate the packers?
B:	huh. now i've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, i guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.
M:	i like it.
B:	right, uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	you should check out the other ones
B:	yeah.
M:	a nissan is not the best car.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i've been to france.
B:	and, uh, yeah.
M:	well, you're not the only one.
B:	heavy science. are you like in the particle, particle research or anything like that or is it more, um, applied physics?
M:	what is this?
B:	and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.
M:	i'm not even sure who the cowboys are anymore.
B:	yeah.
M:	maybe he's a murderer.
B:	is that, is that good? you know, i've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but i've never tried it, are they really good?
M:	i
B:	right, that's, see that's what we did in girl scouts and that got you involved real good and it, i think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
M:	
B:	like i, i traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.
M:	i was.
B:	didn't one,
M:	yeah, i was just making a joke about how we are a small community.
B:	oh that's one of the requirements i asked him. i said, now you do like cats, right. we don't
M:	i know.
B:	make sure we get our cash flow.
M:	there,
B:	then she was starting to get, uh, you know, lose memory sometimes and, which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
M:	we were on the way to a military base.
B:	i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
M:	i don't know.
B:	the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights, starting fairly late, like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. they have some british comedy that we've, we've really liked,
M:	i think you have to have a cat to have any pets.
B:	but, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh, somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict texas weather, but. well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,
M:	they're plant matter.
B:	i, i don't agree with how the media handles elections.
M:	well, there's also the whole, uh, shooting.
B:	to get them on their,  yeah.
M:	i think it is good.for you
B:	tablets?
M:	you know, if i had to choose between the two, i'd go with the latter.
B:	new york.
M:	
B:	you too.
M:	3?
B:	so travel and leisure, food and wine and i think they have some others, uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.
M:	i want to go to argentina
B:	it just depends on the, on the, uh, on the tree.
M:	you can't
B:	i mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
M:	you're welcome.
B:	okay, yeah, it sounds good.
M:	it's a small place.
B:	i think that i would like to, if you know, we all say, if i could have the car i always wanted i would either buy a nissan maxima, uh,
M:	yup.
B:	yeah.  uh-huh, well from what i i saw a statistic just a few days ago, um, so far this year, or was it during the last year, during a year's time, i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. so i, i, and it's building up, you know, they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.
M:	you know, i don't know how to spell, but i know i've got a degree in it.
B:	yeah .
M:	i don't think that's
B:	oh, that sounds like a fun, fun field.
M:	because i know that it's going to be an expensive process.
B:	right.
M:	i'm sorry, but how do you think they do that?
B:	the first one, they started them indoors this time. i read it,
M:	yeah. it's nice.
B:	well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
M:	oh, i've never been home schooled.
B:	right, the child will learn to like cats. and deal with them,
M:	
B:	yeah. there's, there's a race in australia with solar powered cars.
M:	oh, that's cool. it was in mississippi.
B:	uh, let's see, i've had gerbils, i have, i had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
M:	you know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not good at typing.
B:	yeah.
M:	they can be pretty annoying.
B:	but then, i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
M:	what's that?
B:	um, as far as the new hires, i, i hired on just early enough that i, i missed it. um, where the new hires were concerned but, uh, not, nobody, no, i don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, i, i don't know, that, that's where i think that most people get upset. it's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh, it's just, it, it's a really tough question
M:	i'm not sure what you mean by that, but i don't think i've ever seen any of those.
B:	that, uh,
M:	but, uh, uh...
B:	um, she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care. uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory  so they  were almost, you know, to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.
M:	i'm in texas
B:	yeah.
M:	he was a good boy.
B:	i see him out there,
M:	yeah, i know, i'm saying that they're expensive because of their origins.
B:	and,
M:	i never thought i'd be in the minority on this one, but i'm still a big fan of the program.
B:	yeah. uh, like september was hot and dry, october.
M:	...
B:	yeah.
M:	why does this dog look like a german shepherd?
B:	yeah, i think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem, and i think it could get worse.
