B:	and, uh, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare.
M:	it's up.
B:	oh no.
M:	i'm sure she'll be fine
B:	but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.
M:	i love them
B:	yeah.
M:	we do.
B:	well, what did you do when you helped these people?
M:	oh, yeah
B:	so, when he died, we got a little one.
M:	last year?
B:	and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb, dumb retrievers and i'm, and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed,
M:	... that, logic.
B:	i would say.
M:	if you were in the jury, i'm sure you would be able to tell the judge what the judge said.
B:	i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things, i mean, i think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
M:	the movie was called the same thing.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	are you talking about me?
B:	well, how does this grab you? how did this grab you? uh, this, i, i mean, i'm, i'm a lady, but this, i heard this on a christian program and it was, uh, about the n e a and, that's the national endowment for arts, and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.
M:	that's what i meant.
B:	right.
M:	i've never heard of that, i was just thinking about it.
B:	yeah. well, i'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying. they're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
M:	hehuh.
B:	well, i know up in connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
M:	so what you want to do, is it like a hug?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	how are you going to build the car?
B:	um.
M:	it's, uh, the, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	why is it that they are so cheap?
B:	and so, and in the book, you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. and, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth. and, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
M:	oh, are you from texas?
B:	uh-huh. and
M:	oh, okay.
B:	well, when you start early, i guess,
M:	what time is it?
B:	but if i had the little red c r x , i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that. and if i got the c r x it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too.
M:	oh, well, i just feel better about myself today.
B:	so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.
M:	no
B:	do your own thing. yeah.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	yeah, i guess you can,
M:	i was thinking of a different scenario.
B:	you know, we get this lackadaisical attitude, and say, huh, you know, why should we vote, then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things.
M:	it was pretty cold when we rescued her, but she's just been a bit chilly lately.
B:	i can't remember
M:	if they were not in jail, how did they do it?
B:	no, that's not right. that's not right. that's not right.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	well, i know in north carolina, we do have capital punishment.
M:	you have to be in school to do that.
B:	uh
M:	
B:	oh this person had mental problems
M:	not really.
B:	yeah. yeah, it was. saw a few bears things like that.
M:	i think you mean the group of peers.
B:	"huh-uh. *according to the following utterance, this is an affirmative answer, so should be ""uh-huh"" just my husband and i and the two dogs."
M:	i believe in the, and
B:	okay, well
M:	wouldn't it be easier to just make it at your own house.lol
B:	some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless. this may seem to be the best way out. i don't know.
M:	why are you so awesome?
B:	yeah.
M:	i think it's too late.
B:	yeah, i do too.
M:	it '
B:	yeah.
M:	, they,?
B:	yeah.  and i'm also  i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would you know, in areas where they
M:	it's not a scam, it's a deal
B:	uh-huh.
M:	
B:	uh, that's great.
M:	i'm not sure. i think it was a joke.
B:	uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know, remodeled.
M:	i don't wanna talk about it.
B:	yeah. anyway, um, i guess it's,
M:	no.not even the person who passed it.
B:	yeah, it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard you have to plod through it and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
M:	u uuuuuuuu uh
B:	and, uh, a lot of those people have, and at time, you know, they all knew one another.
M:	he is so, so old.
B:	so they, uh, it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
M:	the items are random.
B:	you know, in case,  you know, in case you ever need to bail out
M:	i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm not sorry.
B:	and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions.
M:	i can't say, i'm not sure.
B:	but washington's a great place to do that.
M:	ohh, i see.
B:	right.
M:	i.
B:	but i, i think it can't be something that's mandatory.
M:	yes
B:	i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but, uh, it's on the books.
M:	i am not sure what is happening.
B:	or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
M:	we.
B:	yeah, kind of put in a certain amount per year, *82 and 84 same utt?
M:	i'm not sure how you can do that, but i do it with a rice cooker.
B:	yeah, i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle, you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
M:	..
