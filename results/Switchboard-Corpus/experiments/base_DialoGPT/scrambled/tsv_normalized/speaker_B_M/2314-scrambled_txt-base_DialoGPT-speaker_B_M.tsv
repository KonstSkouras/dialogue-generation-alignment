B:	and, uh, they've been to the guadalupe river, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, i guess colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.

B:	uh-huh.
M:	so, uh, uh. yeah, uh... yeah, uh
B:	oh, well, that's nice. yeah.
M:	you, uh, i know.
B:	oh no.
M:	
B:	that'd be the best way to be.
M:	i don't be a doctor?
B:	yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
M:	what's the time for?
B:	well, the good stuff. right.
M:	...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	
B:	but how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first baby, almost any day uh-huh.
M:	yeah, i'm not really sure. i don't really have any plans for the next year, so i'm kinda just gonna wait for the new year.
B:	unlike a car where it's running.
M:	is there a guy who can play piano?
B:	oh no, they're just, they're, they're just, uh, they're wonderful, uh.
M:	yeah, like, you?

M:	well, i'm pretty sure that it's not a thing.
B:	we did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, boone greene, no out at, uh andrews,
M:	that was the hardest part of that video for me.

B:	so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
M:	it's not a virus. it's a virus.the same thing as the flu virus.
B:	that's, uh, yeah, really true. but like the friends, other friends of mine have cats, they have four of them, and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,
M:	you mean like a half hour?
B:	i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the, they seem to be social, they seem to be economically driven also.

B:	you too.
M:	you can i just tell me?
