M:	no. not really.
B:	huh.
M:	because, i think, a lot people, uh, depends on how much money i have
B:	because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. how they going to pay their bills. they just lay them off.
M:	how about you?
B:	well, i have seen a big change, i think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my, what i was going to study
M:	i'm sorry.
B:	no.
M:	i mean, the guy was a senator in louisiana
B:	uh-huh. have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time?
M:	well, i don't have kids, so...
B:	but washington is one of my favorite places to visit. uh, my daughter lives in arlington, and when i go to visit her, i love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern virginia or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although i don't do that regularly.

B:	and many times i've seen on trials they have on t v, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but i think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.
M:	you can't, you can't win a super bowl in a season.
B:	and i totaled them all up and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.

M:	it's not that expensive.
B:	well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad
M:	i can't even start a farm, so it's just a farm
B:	so i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about, i disagree with them.
M:	you're not getting out.
B:	oh yes, yes.
M:	right. so, uh, they'll fix it.
B:	and i don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.
