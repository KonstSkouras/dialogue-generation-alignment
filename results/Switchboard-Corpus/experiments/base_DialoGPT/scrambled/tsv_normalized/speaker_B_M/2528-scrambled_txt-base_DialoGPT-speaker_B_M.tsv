M:	i like country.
B:	can you stand up in it?
M:	...
B:	because i mean i play the flute and not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so but uh i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the when i i don't play i like jazz music but
M:	i'm sure you can get away
B:	but it's it uh uh actually some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer uh for four days. also  going fishing uh
M:	...
B:	yeah.

B:	right.
M:	so you're saying there's a chance?
B:	the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things.
M:	it's been
B:	uh-huh uh yeah. i'm i am uh i go to the church of christ. i have been raised in the church of christ and uh but uh i uh too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're uh supposed you're supposed to look your sunday best uh uh and dress and proper attire

B:	that is just really neat. because i
M:	you're
B:	uh it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on
M:	they could but i don'know if it's possible.
B:	i really don't think so. yeah. i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent i i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it.
M:	oh yeah it's cold out i'm trying to build a snowman
B:	i tape it.
M:	wait what?
B:	okay
M:	i don't think they'll be cheap. i'd rather have a car with a great history than a car that's been abused and abused for years.
B:	yeah the first first couple of times it's pretty scary but uh after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too.
M:	i etc.

M:	you serious?
B:	i don't know.
M:	you know i'm not sure.
B:	well that's yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing.

B:	but i had uh had a ford escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	well i don't think i can say i have ever had to talk to anyone.
B:	i saw that on hard copy
M:	that was fun you know.
B:	so i don't do that anymore. and the the recycling at georgia tech like that uh outside the uh student center they never empty those things.
M:	what about it?
B:	uh-huh. well i thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six s x even though the the price difference is about ten dollars.
M:	?
B:	and uh that's more important than anything else. we could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility.
M:	so you're saying you could have the entire thing done in 5 years?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't think you can recycle paper bags...
B:	so
M:	you're right.
B:	and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family  and help them with the language.

B:	everybody just says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes
M:	you? um i'm not sure.
B:	it is it really is. and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.

M:	i can do that
B:	you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
M:	i like the ones that come with the ones i bought.
B:	well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
M:	... uh
B:	right. yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up.
M:	are you from missouri?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	.
B:	i've had a burmese python i've had rats i've had mice
M:	uhhh yes you are.
B:	yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be it'd be kind of fun i think.
M:	so they'll wait uh for someone to do it uh.
B:	i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.  like uh
