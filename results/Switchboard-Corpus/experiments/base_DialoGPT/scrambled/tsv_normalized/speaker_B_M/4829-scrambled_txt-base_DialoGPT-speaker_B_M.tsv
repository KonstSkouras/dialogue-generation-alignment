M:	is that right?
B:	really?
M:	i think you mean that.
B:	one year i didn't put anything on and i didn't have any problems.

B:	uh, i've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, uh, uh, test equipment and i did the, i, i did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens. it was kind of fun.
M:	i'm pretty sure i got a loan.
B:	for one person?
M:	i'm a mets fan. i've never been to a game.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, that, uh, if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.

B:	uh, it's because i, i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. so i go outside the area for that. and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state. i don't, i don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.
