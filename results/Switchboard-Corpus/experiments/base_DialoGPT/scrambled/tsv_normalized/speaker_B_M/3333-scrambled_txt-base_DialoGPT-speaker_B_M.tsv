B:	yeah, but, so i'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, but at this point we're going to kind of wait, i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but,
M:	i've been told by others to make a story.
B:	sometimes when you lose someone that you really love, you do some crazy things i don't know,
M:	it's, uh, political.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then the rain started.
B:	yeah.
M:	that
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard? that's true.
M:	no, i...
B:	right.  right.  that you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
M:	how long, what?
B:	oh, really?
M:	you
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm.
B:	um, uh-huh, um. yeah, yeah, that's nice. you say have your four year old taking lessons already?
M:	do you think the police should
B:	yeah. so i think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
M:	u trollabot trollaboot
B:	yeah.  how big a lot do you got it on?
M:	yeah, that's how i read it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm making some other things, and then i'll be making some more.
B:	and, uh, you might, you might get a little more thorough, uh, account of something, but really, um, i don't know. so i get most of mine from television

B:	those petroleum products are going to kill us.
M:	we don't have any crime statistics.
B:	she loves lots of windows. that's great.

B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think he just got in a car accident
B:	and everybody wanted rin tin tin. and it was known as a german shepherd here. so they created a breed standard. the american kennel club did.
M:	so, and you're you're right.
B:	actually through electronic mail.
M:	that.
B:	yeah. i'd like to get one of these little small ones, that you see in all these gardening magazines.
M:	
B:	oh, wow.
M:	ohh. uh.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	that's how you get.
B:	oh, is she still there?
M:	it's a shame that they're not called, i'd love to have a team called
B:	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year
M:	when will the patch be available?
B:	until you pull the pin, yeah.
M:	they don't have any other schools.
B:	the first sunday in october, the jordan family gets together.
M:	what is the difference between a ford gt and
B:	my tax bracket is, is pretty high up there. i pay the, i generally pay the maximum tax bracket.
M:	oh yeah, uh, i think you're right.
B:	so that's make up most of the laboratory so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small it's pretty small.
M:	it's just strange.
B:	i've always said that it, it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline.
M:	and they're the sentence for the inmates
B:	oh.
M:	well, uh, how do we do it?
B:	yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
M:	alright then.
B:	i don't know what it was, we had a real rainy spring
M:	are you guys still going?
B:	um,
M:	uh, what?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not going to tell you how to feel.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't think so.
B:	very interesting.
M:	oh??
B:	that's a good idea.
M:	what about her?
B:	and, uh, it, i think that's what happens when they get scattered, the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.
M:	huh. what about them?
B:	but i used to do it quite a bit.
M:	you can use any kind of tea
B:	and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road. now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment, but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,
M:	it's the?
B:	and, and for them that's wonderful, you know. they, they thought it was the greatest fun, you know, and it didn't cost any money. and, uh, you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.
M:	you can see the city.and the city is in the middle of the ocean.you know what i mean.it's not like we are going to get any new cities.but we have to go to the city.
B:	and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising, like i'll be really tired, and i'll start swimming, and i'll, and i'll actually get energy. and i'll be, have much more energy when i'm done than when i started, i mean, i just feel great. that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim.
M:	i'm sorry, i'm afraid i don't understand.
B:	uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about. although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,
M:	i like it.
B:	okay uh, i've, the high school i went to was, uh, was a good one also. and i, well, i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. because the one i went to was, you know, i'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta.
M:	uhh, not really.
