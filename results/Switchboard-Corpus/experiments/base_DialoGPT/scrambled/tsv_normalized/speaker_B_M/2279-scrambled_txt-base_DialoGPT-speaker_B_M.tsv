B:	uh-huh.
M:	i know, right?
B:	i mean, i, i used to enjoy going, i mean i still do kind of enjoy it, but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that i really, really enjoy seeing.
M:	so, i'm assuming that you don't know about the middle east crisis?
B:	uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? or purchasing.
M:	so, do you think that's a good idea?
B:	and the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	my attic is a lot smaller than my house.
B:	right.
M:	ohhhh, okay, i'm a big fan of the egg.
B:	it's not to say that some day you won't go back to work. my mother's a school teacher and when, when we started, uh, having kids, she had to work for a little while, but then she just started substituting.
M:	heh, i see
B:	it's probably happened to millions of people,
M:	that's what i said.
B:	we when i was, when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like a retriever, you know, the short to the ground, stocky, golden, uh, trainable, tractable, quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house.
M:	i'm back.
B:	there probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.  i mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations, i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.
M:	well, it's not really a nuclear weapon, so there's that.
B:	and, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
M:	...
B:	yeah.
M:	i
B:	but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	yeah, i'm going to the police
B:	me, too.
M:	... uh huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	this is one of the ugliest, most bizarre, most confusing, most nonsensical, most ridiculous, most annoying, most disturbing, most incomprehensible, most hilarious, most
B:	they don't get out of the house, they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it.
M:	what is?
B:	but, uh,  sometimes i,  i said, i sometimes i wish i had more space you know.
M:	we're on the ground floor of a major hospital in the uk
B:	really?
M:	you
B:	and it is, i would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. it might be, i would say it's probably midsized for the area. there are some smaller, and there are, you know, several larger.
M:	i'm sorry
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what's the thing?
B:	huh. well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and i, i know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.
M:	how do they do that?
B:	it, it, it's pretty bad here, too.
M:	uuhh, uh
B:	right. well, that's good. um, how many children do you have?
M:	it's really, really neat.i know of people who would buy it.
B:	uh, cause that makes a big difference. my wife works part-time.
M:	that's not.
B:	some of the, some of the best food i have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like, i'm not eating in there are you nuts? and, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	i'm, uh, good.
B:	yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell. he, he's living now up, uh, in, in maryland but, uh, he, lived in grapevine for a long time.
M:	is it just me or is the second story on the left a bit high?
B:	well i'm not talking about any loss. i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of, the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. but it's an, an amount they're, designed to sting them a little for their,  negligence.   for gross wanton negligence in a claim.
M:	i see.
B:	i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
M:	he's a part of the new york rangers
B:	and because they're so deficient in english, they haven't been able to get jobs.
M:	i have no idea what you mean by that.
B:	i think it's great. i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else, and competition. i'm going oh, great, you know, it's a, it's a great role model for everybody.
M:	uh, yes.
B:	have a good,
M:	you're, and it's
B:	no, we are west.
M:	i mean, you can just say that.
B:	are you mormons?
M:	you're dog?
B:	i, i would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. you know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
M:	that's a big yellow'a '.
B:	quicker  maybe, yeah.
M:	they should be.
B:	well, but it, then they can have them play against each other.
M:	they have a dog and a cat.
B:	but, uh, well i got my thirty day notice yesterday.
M:	what are your fathers'fathers?
B:	but, uh, i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
M:	uhhhhh, uh
B:	huh. i see. i know this isn't on our topic, but where did you grow up in california?
M:	so is it realistic to have porsche porsche racing on a racing simulator?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm just kidding
B:	and the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good, but, the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.
M:	i think i know you.
B:	oh, gee, i heard aspen got three feet.
M:	well, he was a man of many talents.
B:	so what about yours?
M:	i'm pretty sure the farmer was a female.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but i, uh, then part of it's lack of education. i don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
M:	i, i, i like plants.
B:	well, when she got home, who took care of her?
M:	it's a book, so...
