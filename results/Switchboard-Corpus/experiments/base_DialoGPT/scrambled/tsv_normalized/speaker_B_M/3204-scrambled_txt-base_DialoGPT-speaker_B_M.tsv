B:	uh it it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else. as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun
M:	
B:	yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently.
M:	what i?
B:	yeah east texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester
M:	
B:	and why can't you why can't the f d a say you know if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them

M:	you're a lot more likely to get a new doctor if you have an old one.
B:	no.
M:	i agree with you. i'm not saying that they are a danger.
B:	sure did.
M:	the only thing that's different is that it's an english based site.
B:	i like mysteries. i tape um father dowling because that's another mystery
M:	uhhh... that's the whole point of this map...
B:	yeah.
M:	i would never uhhh.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. how about you?
M:	this is like a 2 by 2plex.
B:	no actually uh i'm not even sure i may i'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas
M:	i guess it's more fluid than um i think.
B:	so you know if i think that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
M:	...
B:	uh-huh.  did you go on the barrier  did you see the great barrier reef and and go snorkeling?
M:	so do you know where you're going?
B:	really.
M:	so... are they house cats?
B:	well good talking to you too. bye
M:	i see.
B:	i think so.
M:	what time do you do your summer vacation?
B:	so uh
M:	it's not like you can say what you would be if you grew up in the country.
B:	yeah i think it's it's somewhat a uh symptom of our me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't you know do without too much and you know that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time. you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place  you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it.
M:	you can get out of jury
B:	yeah there you go.
M:	...
B:	they're still doing business. big business apparently.
M:	you.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not sure
B:	uh-huh. absolutely. and that i i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. even if you you know if you take uh a a drug that was prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know
M:	
B:	you know she loves everybody. and little kids can just you know maul all over her
M:	we do a lot more than that.
B:	yeah.
M:	this is not news.
B:	yeah.
M:	i'm pretty sure we don't regressive taxes.
B:	anyways but uh. yeah we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared and and the guy like i said he just uh said that he took her but he won't admit that she died or whatever and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know mandatory life sentences for murder.
M:	oh. alright.
B:	but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh pensacola is a navy town.
M:	i don't
B:	right.
M:	no
B:	uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that. or uh any any after affects carrying over into the workday
M:	i know right? it's like they're not even trying.
B:	oh that's great.
M:	i guess you're right.
B:	yeah yeah. how long has it been since the first one?
M:	why?
B:	really.
M:	yeah but i can't afford it.
B:	huh?
M:	the then.
B:	they don't think twice about it. yeah. either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the
M:	why? what's the point?
B:	and as as time grew i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. and now when they come together it's it's generally you know like say the kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and i do not think they feel the the closeness that they used to be there. which is a shame
M:	yeah. i think he is.
B:	and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so i'm used to pieces and and i played classical flute i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that so. i i can relate to it i suppose but uh and i like i'm like you i like the older stuff too because i like chicago
M:	.
B:	yeah.
M:	that
B:	and because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful my good you're a picky eater if i can get you to
M:	the world is full of people who don't have kids.
