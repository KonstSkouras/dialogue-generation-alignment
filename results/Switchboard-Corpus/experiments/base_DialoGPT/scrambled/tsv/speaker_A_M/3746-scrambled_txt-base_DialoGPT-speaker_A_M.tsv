A:	Such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way.
M:	i know i'm just being a meanie.
A:	I've been in the house I'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
M:	...,
A:	it seems like, really a rough time
M:	It's the same reason you have a pet.
A:	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
M:	You mean like, you know, when they were playing in the Coliseum?
A:	Uh, yes, that's out near the airport. That's about forty-five miles from us.
M:	That's a great home. I'm sure you've seen many stories about it.
A:	Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.
M:	I mean, you don't have to be rich to have insurance.
A:	normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
M:	So... He's been here for nine months?
A:	Right.
M:	Do you listen to any other band?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Do you think you can get a lab?
A:	All right. Well, good to hear, good to hear.
M:	... and?
A:	you're not President Bush. I know and he said yeah, it does so fast , I heard it on the radio. I heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but I didn't see it but,
M:	Oh, what's that?
A:	and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else so that,
M:	You have to.
A:	All local. Were they like all in Dallas?
M:	you.
A:	But, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids *listen: this and utt2 as one utt are the they are so good. I'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and, that, that's what they're called to do.
M:	They have a lot of things that we don't.
A:	And since we go there all the time, I mean
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	Well, they would probably never make it then because I don't think, uh, I only took lessons for golf when I was in college.
M:	This is real
A:	I'm Catholic and we're not supposed to, but, uh, I feel that it, like you, you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
M:	Hahaha, I was talking about Strasbourg, but yeah.
A:	Well, we were there when they had a
M:	I think you are missing the point of this sub.
A:	Yeah, yeah. That's probably where you've used it.
M:	That's just what my cats like to do.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, we, uh, we've got, you know, I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
M:	Yay
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, it's just chicken.
A:	Yeah, okay, well back to crime, I guess we're supposed to talk about that. They say what aspect are you worried about, well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect
M:	You live in Atlanta?
A:	So. Yeah, it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot. I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
M:	The Vikings and Cowboys are both on the downswing
A:	But, I'm sure that's fun.
M:	Like if they went to a different country.
A:	And they're, they're incredible victims of crime. And part of it is this lack of,  lack of basic information, being dissimilated . And I'm not saying it's easy to do, and I know there are a few people who are trying, but, but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
M:	...
A:	Yes.
M:	... You have a fish?
A:	My goodness
M:	I'm not sure, I don't think so.
A:	Yeah, right. That's okay. Well, we've got, um, this town house is pretty big. It's about eighteen hundred square feet. It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
M:	A few hundred dollars a day
A:	would be a definite deterrent and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.
M:	You're a real loser.
A:	I used to be a builder.
M:	I am confused.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	
A:	And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.
M:	America
A:	Yeah, and is that how your parents feel or,
M:	You
A:	I wonder how long it's going to be on for.
M:	...
M:
