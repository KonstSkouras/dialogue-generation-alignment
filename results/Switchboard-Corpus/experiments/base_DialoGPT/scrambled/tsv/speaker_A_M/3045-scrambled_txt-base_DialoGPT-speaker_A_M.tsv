M:	Uhhhhhh. Uh. Uh
A:	And then before the milk gets too hot, um, I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good. And then about a half a cup of sugar and I let it pretty much, I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's, it starts thickening, when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little, I don't know, it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch, and you just keep beating it in. And it's the, the trick is, is to have this blender, so, if you were, you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time, it's, you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened I cook it for a good, once it starts boiling, I just, I cook it for a good seven minutes, seven to ten minutes

A:	Uh-huh, or if somebody gets sick. Yeah, or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,
M:	I'm trying to figure out how to pronounce this.
A:	How about the health food, uh, restaurants? Well, like this one but it's probably not advertised as such, is it? Or,
M:	Colorado. It's a nice place to be
A:	I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
M:	lol
A:	And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, and, uh, so, it, it's, uh, it's not really my peers that, if I were let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury I wouldn't feel that, uh, I would be being tried by a jury of my peers.

M:	
A:	Right.  yeah.
