A:	Yeah, what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
M:	He's a good boy.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	.
A:	Because I know they do frequently, I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by that.
A:	but that, that kind of takes away from public service.
M:	I'm not.
A:	Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.
M:	I hope you have a good day.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. And I think, you know, we have such a need now, you know, I taught, you know, I, I think I was paid, uh, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
M:	i, do.
A:	I'm not either really.
M:	It's
A:	and the seeds go right through them.
M:	I
A:	That's so stupid that you all have two teams.
M:	No, he just said that he is very good at this.
A:	Yes, I've seen those. They're cute.
M:	And you
A:	No, a five speed. And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
M:	What do you, I do you?
A:	No.
M:	Is that a 60?
A:	Yeah, that's true,
M:	You.
A:	You know, if someone is
M:	No. No.
A:	Oh, I saw that.
M:	i have no idea what i'm talking
A:	Oh, oh, yes, we start here at, uh, five.
M:	... how do you do this?
A:	Um,
M:	Ah, I'm sure you're right.
A:	oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision.
M:	You
A:	She's ninety-two.
M:	lt
A:	but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry.
M:	She looks like a great mom.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You do?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't really know what you mean by that.
A:	Sure.
M:	Well, we play in the same course.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	Uh... I've been to places.
A:	But I always feel like I would never put my parents in either and I wonder, I'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for. You know,
M:	This isnt a story, its a compilation of what youve heard
A:	Or, you know, plead insanity.
M:	We,
A:	Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
M:	Haha,
A:	It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem
M:	Wait, what?
A:	our mothers used to use it. And then,
M:	I'm not sure, maybe.
A:	Right, and then, you know, sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but, We're, it's real important to us to spend time together.
M:	I'm just joking around, I'm not a cat
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why?
A:	and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met. Um, she's had them for a couple years. And um, you know, they're really cute, they're, they're sisters,
M:	Do you really have to go out to class to talk to people?
A:	Uh, I Yeah, I and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever I I think that that's viable. Um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. I think. Yeah Because, realistically, like for you for you you don't think it's right
M:	 Citiz
A:	Oh, I think that's great.
M:	What??? I've been doing this for months.
A:	and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton, and were several thousand miles away
M:	You're not alone.
A:	And. Yeah.
M:	Oh, I see. I didn't know you could do that.
A:	and so it kind of wound down,
M:	I'm not allergic
A:	No, I'm the one,
M:	Yeah, uh, no.
A:	Right.
M:	It's been like that since the first day
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Do you have a lot of plants?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I can't, can't
A:	Oh, that's neat.
M:	How did you get in there?
A:	Uh, very good.
M:	Uh uh
A:	My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
M:	I don't know, but he spends hours reading,
A:	Yeah.
M:	
A:	That and sleeping late
M:	i think you should visit some places.
A:	Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.
M:	He nods.
A:	Yeah, it would be a good experience, and you'd be helping people, I'm sure. Very much. And and I mean, not to put, not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but I do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble. I mean, and part of the problem is that, a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from, you know, decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
M:	He didn't say he was.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't
A:	It is inside and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
M:	And I know, because uh, I know.
A:	Then you'll never leave.
M:	We've got some of the best presents in the world.
A:	It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
M:	??? You're a new player
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts, so .
M:	Yes??
A:	I enjoy,  Excuse me, go ahead. Uh-huh.
M:	I do, uh, uh
A:	Uh, Dallas is having quite a few. Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related. Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.
M:	I'm pretty sure you can
A:	Uh-huh. Do you do that very often?
M:	You.
A:	There are, there are.  It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah.
M:	I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's not.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I
A:	Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.
M:	She had a pet, and she's now in a relationship.
A:	You have the seven day waiting period.
M:	',,.
A:	You have to. Because   there's always more things to do.
M:	So, uh, what are they doing?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You
M:	Uhh, you don't pay taxes on the income of your income, right?
