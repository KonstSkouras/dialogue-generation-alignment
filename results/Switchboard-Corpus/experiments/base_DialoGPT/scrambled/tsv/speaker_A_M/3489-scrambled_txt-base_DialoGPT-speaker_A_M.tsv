A:	No, no.
M:	Yeah.Yeah.Yep.Yep
A:	That's right. I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.
M:	I remember seeing her in a movie, and I remember she was like... a little over a year old.
A:	Uh,
M:	I agree
A:	They don't look a thing a like,
M:	It's a good thing.
A:	Yeah.
M:	The kids are the best feeders.
A:	Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
M:	Don't you mean the game?
A:	I mean, we are all different so,
M:	I do not eat at restaurants.
A:	but they, at, at the T I there, I said is there any area I should avoid. And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself, or anything. And she, she thought for a few minutes and she said, no. And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. She said, no. And they said, it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
M:	... and then
A:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.   Right, any ,  on the street, no, I know.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, and Texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the, the I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
M:	Uuhuhuh.
A:	So, maybe you would,
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Yeah.
M:	No, I don t.
A:	They, they became, in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. And that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
M:	I'm sorry?
A:	Um, the area itself, uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, um, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments
M:	Who's the team?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, we're planting
A:	you all equated the family reunions as,  with the Protestant.
M:	Social studies
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	
A:	but Yeah. but it that's uh that's what I mean, see, but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing, and it evokes an emotional response. I think that's the hardest thing, I don't know if I could ever be a judge, because some things emotionally just aren't you know
M:	You're in the district, right?
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	... why is he in a relationship?
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	I think she's going to have to make a joke about that first, I think
A:	So, well, I don't know that's my, my great hard recipe.
M:	I'm serious. I'm pretty sure that there are a lot more of those people in the legal system than you think.
A:	I went, well I did work, um, just very for some time but I didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a difference.
M:	I like
A:	What's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't, you know, we take the time to, you know, help my daughter, she's in college,
M:	I'm not sure.
A:	So, what are your thoughts on dining out?
M:	Why do you think that?
A:	And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I, I have, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the, show the mugging victim, you know, show what the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, and, uh, or, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. Let's, let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that.
M:	
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
M:	
A:	Well, I've never had catfish either in a restaurant because I'm from the north and that was a no no.
M:	The Rams, Chiefs, and the Chiefs have all won Super Bowls.
A:	My husband has taken us to work with him, and we still don't know what he does.
M:	I'm reading
A:	No, regardless of that fact. It's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. I'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
M:	You can't.
A:	made me stop and think a minute about, not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.
M:	...
A:	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, uh, to convict somebody
M:	I remember when they won the Super Bowl.
A:	Yeah.  Yeah. Right. Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with.
M:	And I'm not gonna leave
A:	They, they, just started trying to get them, something together like, like that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice storm uh, very, very recently.
M:	Hmmm... I'll have
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Makes, uh, makes a colorful salad too.
M:	What are you doing for a week?
A:	But, uh, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
M:	Do you work in a basement?
A:	But I don't think there's any way you could go, uh, the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people, and I don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either.
M:	Uhhh, you know, I'm a human.
A:	Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas, but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of Pennsylvania.
M:	oh, like.
A:	So, so I guess our vote is no
M:	You could say they were... so far.
