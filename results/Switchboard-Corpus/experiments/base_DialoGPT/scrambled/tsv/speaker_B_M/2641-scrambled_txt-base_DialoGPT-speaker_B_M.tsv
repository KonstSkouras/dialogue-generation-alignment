B:	So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective. Uh, you know, their major interest is in commissions and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines. Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is and it gives you a different perspective on what people do.
M:	Oh, I was just making a joke about the huge difference in the size of the ocean.
B:	Huh.
M:	Do you have any dogs?
B:	No kidding.
M:	3,
B:	All right.
M:	The kids in the town are also getting thrown out of school.
B:	And that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, God, I'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,
M:	I work with him and shake his hand
B:	Oh. Oh, that sounds so pretty.
M:	yes
B:	Beautiful.
M:	How
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.
M:	Yeah, but they do the same things to other people.
B:	Yeah, and how about, how about like on the weekends. Do you do sports or do you go out?
M:	But... uh... it's been like a year since I've been back...
B:	and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best friends
M:	Well, they're all tomatoes.
B:	But we like good uh, we're, we like Mexican food.
M:	You take any magazines?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I,,, I like the,,
B:	Well, we, That's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	I hate to put it quite that way.
M:	I'll play with your hand
B:	It's a legal job, you know
M:	I'm trying to get back home.
B:	Oh uh-huh.
M:	What about you?
B:	He collects trash. You know, and,
M:	I read
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're not wrong, I've never even heard of that place.
B:	Oh, gee.
M:	That's the sound of a guitar
B:	and, uh. Yeah, how do you feel about it?
M:	Do you have any experience with slab building?
B:	Gorgeous. That's, you know, I think you could drive along in Maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the, and the pines and what not, and you could, you know, you could be driving along in East Texas and looks just the same. It's almost, you know, identical kind of country.
M:	Uh, I'm sorry?
B:	and, uh, we just thought it was absolute heaven.
M:	I don't think I can handle the idea of a lot of people having the same idea of what a lot is.
B:	Oh, well, that's nice.
M:	You don't
B:	Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	Is it, not to you personally?
B:	I mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma.
M:	I'd throw it, but I don't think you can throw a.
B:	Right, that's true. Or even have you ever seen where they, they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out, and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
M:	Oh, well, that's
B:	And especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever,
M:	Do you mean the monthly fee?
B:	Right.
M:	I've been to the midwest. The Midwest is nice.
B:	When the days start getting a little longer, you know, you can, I can start doing it in the evening after work.
M:	I'm not sure about that.
B:	What does that house got attraction?
M:	How do you?
B:	You know it's so exciting.
M:	I love it!
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	The weird thing is, it doesn't look like anything to me.
B:	and they just get away with it, and nothing happens.
M:	How many daughters do you own?
B:	I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,
M:	Did someone actually play it?
B:	Yeah. That's true.
M:	Oh? I think that was the last job I ever had.
B:	but I think we would make a bigger investment in kids, we'd have fewer decisions to make. Down the road, you know.
M:	I know.
B:	all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
M:	Yes
B:	I that true, yeah. Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is, is basically a reject, somebody had bought him, and wanted him.
M:	Nah, yeah,
B:	And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable. They didn't have to do much to it.
M:	You.
B:	people go, oh, well, I'll just go buy it, put it on credit and they'll pay it off.
M:	Yeah, but if you don't feel it, you don't know how to feel.
B:	I think it would be really. really great.
M:	What?
B:	Uh-huh, it really could, and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead, and they keep dragging it on, and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
M:	You,
B:	Oh, is that right?
M:	I go to school in Turkey.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	
B:	Yes.
M:	I'm just not sure how it would be financially wise to do that.
B:	All right.
M:	I think you mean the one that was on the news for years.
B:	Yeah, I don't think we,
M:	I'm going back to the future.
B:	And boy that thing screams now.
M:	Well, we are a very small country.
B:	And the Cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys, and the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season, and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys, so.
M:	every week
B:	And I do get tired of that but, uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want to change it.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So?
B:	Right, right, right. And you really have to make, uh, quite a bit of money. The wife doesn't make it worth it, with the cost of day-care.
M:	I am the one who sings, my son.
B:	Yeah. Makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.
M:	I, uh, I don t know.
B:	You know, to get into the economics of things, uh, because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards,  it really, you know, ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.
M:	Ok. So, what's the next question?
B:	Well, yeah, I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,
M:	You can't really cut back on the use of the market.
B:	It was real nice.
M:	It's a funny vowel.
B:	And it's not a city, not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, I can't even see their house and, uh,
M:	Oh. I am?
B:	but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
M:	I love it, but I'm not sure if I'm going to enjoy it.
B:	That's great.
M:	I'e?
B:	They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
M:	I have a friend who can get me a bag
B:	Yeah, I know what family home evening's all about.
M:	I.
B:	What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?
M:	I've been doing this with my rice. I put a cup of broth in there and then I add a little water.
B:	So,
M:	The only time I've ever been to the place was when I was in high school
B:	We never could get it declared a lemon, and the car would go and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
M:	Wait, what?
B:	Oh yeah. It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.
M:	...
B:	That's what she plans to do.
M:	And it's not even a real grass.
B:	and then he had a, um, I forget what type of fish it was, it was one of these fish that it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like that. There would be sort of moby fish in a tank.
M:	that's a pretty common thing.
B:	Well,
M:	Yeah, he's a very nice guy.
B:	Right.
M:	Well, the Supreme court has no power to appeal.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So uh, you think that's a good idea?
B:	Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual  uh, reunion.
M:	They didn't think it was a big deal, they just didn't care.
B:	Yeah.
M:	you
B:	Well, my other line is ringing
M:	That, I don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, he's really nice.
B:	Yeah.
