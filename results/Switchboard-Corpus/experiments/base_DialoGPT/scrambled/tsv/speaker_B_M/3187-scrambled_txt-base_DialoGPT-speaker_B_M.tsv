M:	Is that an old model?
B:	Huh.
M:	The lawyers have been involved in a lot.
B:	But that's because it's so old.
M:	I'm not sure if that's how it works.
B:	Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
M:	They're in my neighborhood.
B:	but the Texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.

M:	You see?
B:	Yeah.
M:	You've
B:	Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched.
M:	there's more of a difference between this and the death penalty
B:	Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.
M:	That's true.
B:	Well, I think we're about to run out of our time.
M:	Uhhh, we,
B:	Okay.
M:	...
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
