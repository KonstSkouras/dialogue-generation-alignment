M:	He's the canal
B:	Um.
M:	you can call me
B:	And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't have any opinion.
M:	How about that
B:	You know what I miss though? Basements.
M:	Oh gosh, uh, yeah.
B:	and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
M:	So, I mean, you, you
B:	Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift and, what, I'm, I'm curious. I, I know why I love a stick shift. Why why did you want one?
M:	LOLF, why?
B:	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
M:	I love how it's the most popular cooking show on TV.
B:	Like, like, name one
M:	Oh, uh, I see.
B:	Yeah, I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without

M:	What city
B:	and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue, and, uh, oh, that was great.
