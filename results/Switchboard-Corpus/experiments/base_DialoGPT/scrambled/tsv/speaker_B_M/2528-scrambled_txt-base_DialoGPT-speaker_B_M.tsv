B:	uh, father's. My mother's father's family had quite a few, uh, brothers and sisters.
M:	Why do they do this?
B:	That's great.
M:	Oh, I'm fine, just don't want to be alone.
B:	Okay. Go ahead.
M:	What about the tower?
B:	I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty but,
M:	
B:	Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um,
M:	I like country.
B:	Can you stand up in it?
M:	...
B:	because I mean, I play the flute and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh, I like classical music just because of the, when, I, I don't play, I like jazz music but
M:	I'm sure you can get away
B:	but it's, it, uh, uh, actually some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer, uh, for four days. Also  going fishing, uh
M:	...
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's
B:	and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, and it's always the same man
M:	I think that's how they got the radiation.
B:	Right.
M:	So you're saying there's a chance?
B:	the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it, you know, it's like two different things.
M:	It's been
B:	Uh-huh Uh, yeah. I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ. I have been raised in the Church of Christ and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best uh, uh, and dress and proper attire
M:	Are you riding?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
B:	So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.
M:	You'rein.
B:	Yeah, they were.
M:	Lol.
B:	that is just really neat. Because I,
M:	You're
B:	Uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. Uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,
M:	They could, but I don'know if it's possible.
B:	I really don't think so. Yeah. I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, it may prevent, I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it.
M:	Oh yeah, it's cold out, I'm trying to build a snowman
B:	I tape it.
M:	Wait, what?
B:	Okay,
M:	I don't think they'll be cheap. I'd rather have a car with a great history than a car that's been abused and abused for years.
B:	Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
M:	I, etc.
B:	huh.
M:	Yeah, it's hard for me too.
B:	so I don't do that. So I take it and I send, and I mail it back to them.
M:	I live in the US
B:	Yeah, that's true .
M:	I have it on a computer, and it's pretty great.
B:	Uh, um so long as it's their possession. Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,
M:	You serious?
B:	I don't know.
M:	You know, I'm not sure.
B:	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.
M:	I think so.
B:	But I had, uh, had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well I don't think I can say I have ever had to talk to anyone.
B:	I saw that on Hard Copy
M:	That was fun, you know.
B:	so, I don't do that anymore. And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
M:	What about it?
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.
M:	?
B:	and, uh, that's more important than anything else. We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
M:	so, you're saying, you could have the entire thing done in 5 years?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think you can recycle paper bags...
B:	so,
M:	You're right.
B:	And he spends, well, right now, he's down to like once a week, but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,  and help them with the language.
M:	They have a great sense of humor.
B:	everybody just says how wonderful it is, and it's it's like, uh, yes,
M:	You? Um, I'm not sure.
B:	It is, it really is. And I mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.
M:	
B:	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
M:	Did I say something wrong?
B:	Right.
M:	I did.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	...
B:	Again.
M:	I've been seeing signs for years, and I'm not even in the UK.
B:	I, I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
M:	I can do that
B:	you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
M:	I like the ones that come with the ones I bought.
B:	Well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
M:	... uh
B:	Right. Yeah, my backyard is, uh, is sloping so I built a box up, you know had to build the one, the low side up.
M:	Are you from Missouri?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	.
B:	I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice
M:	Uhhh, yes, you are.
B:	Yeah, it must be fun to be able to play it and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.
M:	So they'll wait, uh, for someone to do it, uh.
B:	I guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.  Like, uh
M:	Okay, um, I'll be here.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I,
