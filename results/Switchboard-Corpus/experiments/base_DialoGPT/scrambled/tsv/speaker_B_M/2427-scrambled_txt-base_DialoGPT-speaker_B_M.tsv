M:	... I don't think you understand the question.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	You're a joke.

M:	
B:	Yeah, it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months.
M:	I see
B:	but I think it's Elijah
M:	Like a hydraulic pump?
B:	Right.

B:	Oh, that's exciting.
M:	I have a feeling that they'll be back soon.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	You're.
B:	Well, I think that's true, and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.
M:	I '
B:	Uh-huh Yeah.
M:	That cat was just too cute.
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
M:	I, uh, I,
B:	And they would, you know, I, I picked off like twenty of them and,
M:	I don't know, it's just been raining for a while.
B:	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
M:	Uhhuh
B:	Oh, really.
M:	I.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well uhuh. I don't wanna play strikeout.
B:	I can't, it, it's a oh gosh, it's like Elijah, or something like that.
M:	Well, I like to photograph things.
B:	And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
M:	I
B:	I mean they go right back where they came from.
M:	I think it was a lot more than that.
B:	And then put that back in the saucepan?
M:	It's, it's.
B:	then they put them back in jail, and they get out, and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed

M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a pretty nice place to live, but you can't live there forever.It's a paradise.For now.

M:	A Honda, uh, Mercedes?
B:	Yeah.
M:	He's a good candidate for the job.
B:	I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
M:	Why do you have a summer job?
B:	I know, I know, it's true.
M:	Heh
B:	Yeah, if they really can,  um, I think the the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.
M:	Is that a single window?
B:	"And I asked him, I got to talking to him, I said, well, how is his nephew doing. ""Well, I don't know, I haven't,  talked to my brother in three years."" I said , ""Well, how's your brother doing?"" ""I don't know."" Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think, but I don't."
M:	Yeah, the food is pretty good.

M:	Well, I was thinking more of a'They're not a big company, they're just a small company '
B:	it really does the job. But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. And if you're not really committed to it, I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week, and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something, and by then it's burned up, you know.

M:	How long have we been in this area?
B:	Its reliability. And, uh, I, you know, I've read all the CONSUMER REPORTS and things, and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars. If Ford was a head and the shoulders above it, I'd buy a Ford.
M:	You can get a pretty good dog that can handle a high level of water.
B:	Oh, yeah, that's neat.
