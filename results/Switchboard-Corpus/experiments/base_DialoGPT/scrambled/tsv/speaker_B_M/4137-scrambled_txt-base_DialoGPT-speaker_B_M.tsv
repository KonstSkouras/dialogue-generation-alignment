B:	That's a whole other topic to begin with too but. Yeah, but it's, you are right. I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important.
M:	He's dead.
B:	So this is the big issue with us. Although I don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time and,
M:	What's up with the guy in the picture?
B:	Um, me either. I, I went to college and then started working and then got married and,
M:	It's the same in Ireland, but the media are too busy talking about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	A whole new world. Uh-huh.
M:	How many times have you tried this?
B:	so you've been all through Europe.
M:	Yeah, but it's a very different situation.
B:	Oh, I, I believe in the death penalty, I really do.
M:	Well, I'm not sure what you're asking, but I don't think you need any help.
B:	But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	So... would that make it a good idea?
B:	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	Colorado, but I think it's Colorado.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it. Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state. I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.
M:	I'm from Las Vegas.
B:	My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
M:	Oh, I thought the car was just a battery.
B:	and, and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer.
M:	Uhh, I'm not sure I'm ready for this
B:	Yeah.
M:	No.They're not.
B:	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?
M:	I'm pretty sure the house was made in the 70's.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Local
B:	Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off?
M:	I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.
B:	Oh, well, still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids.
M:	They do
B:	Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
M:	The'U'is silent.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We have to have a good story to the people of Iceland.
B:	Yeah.  larger computer ones.
M:	You can always move her out of the house.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm in the UK. I'm not a citizen.
B:	Uh-huh, relaxed and laid back and stuff
M:	She's still in her house?
B:	But,
M:	We should just go to the end of the world.
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
M:	Are you talking about the food or the food?
B:	Uh, Clarion County.
M:	uhuh. we were happier together
B:	You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
M:	I'm sorry.
B:	Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
M:	Wait. I mean... are you sure?
B:	Yeah. And the, the laws are all, the rules. Some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women
