M:	Why? It's not like the car is the only thing that's not being built.
B:	Oh, I do too, I think they're doing real good job.
M:	I have a friend that's a mechanic who's been in the field for 20 years. He said he has the same problem with metal.
B:	Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment.
M:	I don't think I could ever get a lawn to go.
B:	I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.

B:	And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.
M:	This is it
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	
B:	And, uh, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that, that part. You know because to me where we live out here in the north east, it, it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other,
M:	You mean like, if you have a child, you have an internal, internal perspective?
B:	It's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit, and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. Of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.

Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner. I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him They remodeled the entire back yard. Then they sold the house and got divorced, so I don't know what that says about it all
