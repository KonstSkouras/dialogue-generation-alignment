A|Right. The only one that we, we have that we kept was the Discover card,
M|You, you, uhhhh...
A|Great.
M|So the Yankees are the New England Patriots?
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|I don't know, it's hard to see her.
A|Um.
M|
A|and, uh, so we have watched that
M|Yup.
A|Oh. That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing. Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
M|Are you referring to wealth disparity?
A|And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap, so, when you pull the Saran Wrap back, you sort of should be a little careful, pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and I might put it back on. But, um,
M|Well, the more you know.
A|All right. Thank you.  Bye, bye.
M|Uhhh, uh, uh... uh huh.
A|Uh-huh.
M|that,.
A|Oh.
M|I'm not Chris.
A|Right. Are you married?
M|I think he's saying you have a choice of cars.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I, uh, I don't know what to say, uh
A|Remember that?
M|What do you enjoy?
A|And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill
M|Oh. Uh. He was there.
A|And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
M|Not sure why you're getting downvoted, I have no idea.
A|But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
M|Because, the economy
A|I mean, actually I think that works pretty well. and that, that makes,
M|...
A|Yeah I don't know, uh, I guess it just depends on how they manage it.
M|Why?
A|Because we have, you know, everywhere that a tree is down people need help and,  we're all, all, a lot of older folks need help getting,  their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone
M|it.
A|but I've enjoyed talking to you.
M|I'
A|And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great. And we started taking them up there. And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know I didn't know. And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.
M|Erm... um
A|Exactly.
M|Uhh, how many people have you had to work with?
A|Uh-huh.
M|I know
A|Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
M|They stare at you
A|uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
M|Well, I don t know.
A|I got a friend who goes there, by the way I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay.
M|I think.
A|I mean,
M|I don't know, it's on my phone, I can't even read it.
A|Where are you going studying?
M|Ohhuh?
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
M|I don't know what's going on in this picture but it's hilarious
A|Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.
M|Yes.Yes.But.If you have a tape and can't do it.
A|Well, and that's an individual thing.
M|Why would you?
A|Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
M|I read that.
A|And, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
M|Uhhh, why?
A|I really hope they do that in Louisville. It would make it a lot easier on all of us. Talk to you later.
M|Oh, I see.
A|So that's the only reason that we kept that, we debated for a long time plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know, like ...
M|Well, you could build it yourself.
A|Yeah.
M|I
A|Because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in Pittsburgh, from Pittsburgh.
M|Yes.
A|Yeah.
M|I am going to be so sad if we have to see any of my cats in the future.
