A|Oh, well that's okay, um,
M|I'm not sure if they like each other or not.
A|and we were much happier,
M|We have a lot more murders than you.
A|Well, Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
M|Uhh... I know.
A|Yeah. Yeah. was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?
M|I've never been to the meeting.
A|and I thought that was, you know, very interesting and I, I would have thought of that earlier I probably would have done, you know, just like, is that, is this, is that the Mormon church, that does that?
M|I don't think you understand.
A|Yeah.  Yeah, and get even with who, I mean,
M|U?
A|Huh. Uh-huh.
M|Uhhh, uh, uhhh, uhh, uh
A|Yes.
M|We should try again.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Is that the only door?
A|and ours start at, at, at, at eight and end at eleven, that's why we . I, I would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten.
M|Well, they don't have a lot less than they have a ton of, they're a ton's a ton, a ton
A|and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
M|I think of stuff you?
A|So, I, I can see the advantage to that one. The Peace Corps itself is really a, uh, dying out, isn't it?
M|
A|Well, this, this house is very comfortable. We've got two living areas and that, that's the thing I probably like the most about it.
M|It's ok, we can live in Pittsburgh
A|Yeah, I had, my, uh, my father-in-law participated in a, uh, a jury trial, he was, he was actually on the jury,
M|What is it?
A|Wow, you're,  a pro at this.
M|I agree, but I'm not sure I want to set a record of the jury.
A|The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
M|you
A|I, I just don't feel right so. There's lots of places if you're going to go camping. K O A are wonderful. It's kind of it's kind of the, uh, yuppie type of camping because they have showers, they have things for kids to do. They have swimming pools, things like that.  If you  can find, uh, some really nice, clean, uh, campgrounds versus, uh, if you go to state parks, uh,
M|What if I told you that the laws were harsher?
A|But I did a walk last night, and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
M|.
A|Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
M|Yes, it's not a problem.
A|Well, I found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned,  but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.
M|Are you from Pennsylvania?
A|Uh-huh.
M|He smiles back.
A|There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
M|Why don't
A|Oh dear. Oh but that's nice, you know, I mean the peach tree is, is a start and,
M|Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm still a bit confused.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I can't even say that
A|But he jumped in, in the, the river.
M|I know, right?
A|uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
M|Well, it's a yard.
A|Yeah.
M|We're all in a club... uhuh
A|and I think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
M|Yeah, you can get a degree in a few months if you just plan a semester ahead.
A|I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting
M|Uhhh, uh
A|Uh-huh.
M|What
A|Do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?
M|It's a photo of a car, so it's not fake.
A|A T S?
M|that.
A|And so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band.
M|Oh look, a cat.
A|Oh yeah, yeah, we do, we call that doing biscuits,
M|I, uh, I'm not, uh...
A|Yeah,
M|I'm from the nin'y's.
A|Oh.
M|Yeah. I live in Pittsburgh.
A|but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
M|I have to read the newspaper.I'm too lazy.
A|Not that I was looking for sports cars, but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
M|I
A|Yeah, oh, yeah.
M|I eat meat.
A|And, I guess even back to Kennedy, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
M|he sits down, and I sit down
A|Oh.
M|And it's still not the most popular country in the world.
A|Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six, and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty
M|I think we can.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|It's a good game.I like it.It's fun.It's not a chore to play.
A|Oh.
M|No it wasn't
A|It takes a, yeah, it does take some space.
M|Yes, I think that's what I said.
A|I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
M|I'm not gonna lie.
A|Did you really? What, black ones?
M|I am not really interested in the subject matter.
A|Good to hear from you.
M|I am in the same situation.
A|That's about the only real bonus
M|You.
A|Oh, yeah, all that hoedown stuff.
M|Oh.O. I think they have.
A|That's some, yeah, because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position, they, they're very comfortable, they lose the ability to learn, and they in a sense become unteachable. They think they know all there is to know in the area, set path, and you know, come in and put my time in from nine to five, and when that's over with, that's, that's it, without even giving a second thought to , advancing their education or getting extracurricular, um, education, and, and I think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also.
M|I
A|Uh-huh. Right.
M|But... it's not a soup.
A|Uh-huh. The taxes that people don't think about that, yeah, the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
M|I'm... not sure if I should laugh or cry.
A|And, uh,
M|It's always nice to see a family that's straight and straight
M|Oh. So you mean you're not the one who's paying for it?
