A|Well, good to hear. I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania.
M|
A|my, uh, girlfriends do catering and they always, about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray. I think they try and suggest it.
M|Yes, it's
A|but we talked,  a lot about the, the rituals,
M|They have a law to prevent it from happening.
A|I know, I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.
M|Yes, they are.
A|Uh-huh.
M|You're not the one who needs to study.
A|Well, that's the good thing about what is happening because I think more and more the news media, which takes a heck of a beating and, and deserves some of it, is telling us, you know, about the problems. So the more we communicate, hey, look, we want a change here, because, you know, as it turns out, we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country.
M|... I guess.
A|and then,
M|I'm not too sure.
A|Uh-huh, and that costs money, yeah.
M|So what do you think is the ideal outcome?
A|Uh-huh.
M|You could always cheer for the Cowboys
A|Sure. Yeah.
M|that's a pretty cool family tree
A|It is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
M|Oh, is that what you think?
A|Uh-huh. Right.
M|It's.about.a.about.''s.
A|Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
M|I.
A|Well, no that's my other phone.
M|I don't know, I think it's pretty cool.
A|No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was,
M|You're a great, great, wonderful person.
A|Horses?
M|How, then.
A|Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a, let down.
M|Yes.Yeah.Yeah
A|Right.
M|
A|It was, it was an interesting theory. She talked about the, uh, the Catholics all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway, so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all, your, you don't have to come home, so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe, but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became their version of the pilgrimage.
M|It's really, um, nice to see you again.
A|Instead of being carried
M|It.
A|Well, thank you very much. Bye-bye.
M|Uhh, uh, uh
A|We just got our last tomatoes.
M|Oh, uh, well, you know, that's not a bad thing.
A|Yeah.
M|I'll be there for my kids to see them
