A|Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
M|I think it's a little late to make this comment
A|I mean, you honestly do. Now I have friends that I love to death, but, and they have children, but their children does anything, we have to take them, and, you know to do it.
M|It's only like, one of a few trees that it can tolerate.
A|Uh, she enjoys mowing. I can't believe it.
M|yes.
A|Oh, Japan's ridiculous.
M|What's the music?
A|Okay?
M|Today's youth are the future of the world.
A|Yes.
M|Um, um, um...
A|and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
M|Uhh... well, I don't.
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm sorry, I was talking to the guy in the other line
A|Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company or,
M|And? You are the one who is talking about the other phone.
A|And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
M|You know, they're kinda...
A|Yeah, it is. Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
M|They do.
A|Wow.
M|what does that even mean?
A|it's at, that was actually a big dilemma for me now because, um, CHEERS, CHEERS and TWIN PEAKS are now on the same time,
M|No, you have!
A|Yeah.
M|hehehe, yeah, that's right
A|Uh-huh.
M|Oh, that's good.
A|And this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education?
M|I've been going to see it for a while now. It's so awesome.
A|Huh?
M|Where do you live?
A|So we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did,
M|Do they have any idea what they are doing?
A|Yes.
M|I'm so glad you found something to do, it's so peaceful.
A|Not for the price?
M|You
A|Oh, how sweet.
M|I think you meant to say'No '.
A|Yeah, I liked your idea too, there.
M|I'm just curious.
A|Oh gosh. Well actually, I used to play in the Richardson Symphony, I played violin in the orchestra for several years you know,
M|Yeah.But I'm not the one who likes bread.right.well.
A|Uh, you know,
M|She nods
A|Uh-huh.
M|I would say that it is pretty accurate
A|But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year. I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.
M|It is
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's the same reason you can't agree to a political protest. It's a right.
A|and then at the end I had to be too serious.
M|And you mean, like, in this subreddit?
A|Oh, really. Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story. Um.
M|Parking is free on campus.
A|So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
M|Do you do it?
A|You know. We just got our phone back today, uh, and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer, or to have their organizations come, volunteer to help clean up the streets.
M|I think I know you.
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's a weightless, uh, crusher.
A|Oh, of course. It's, it's political maneuvering. The, the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will, you know, want to hang everyone, and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic. They're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror. *whose who's Neither side wants that. They want to find a juror that's going to, uh, be most persuadable by their arguments, you know.
M|...
A|They are a handful.
M|Well, I am
A|It really is, I mean we're, we're in a leased town home, and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
M|This.
