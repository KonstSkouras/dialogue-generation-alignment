M|So.of.land
A|Uh-huh.
M|Well, I don't know, I think it's a possibility
A|And I think you can do that for a little while but I'm,

A|and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
M|no, no, don't. I don' not really, it's, no.
A|Really. Uh-huh.
M|I think I'm gonna go to the top of the mountain and go for a walk.
A|Oh, you do, okay, yeah. I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
