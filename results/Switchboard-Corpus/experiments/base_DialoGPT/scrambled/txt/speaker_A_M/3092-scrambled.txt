A|Got a problem, huh? Um,
M|You're a little late on the cat hate train.
A|Uh-huh. Right, right. Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right. I, I teach swim lessons a lot, and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know, kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.
M|But, uh, I'm a guy.
A|Uh-huh. They live lean for one thing and they tithe and they it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole we don't honor God with this portion and so they, I think that helps a lot. I think that's the key, in he, like his sales last year he just works a normal job. He probably has an income of thirty-five thousand, but last year he made that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van. He loves God, I mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
M|I dont have a link, but i have a feeling that the owner of the car is driving the wrong way.
A|Uh-huh.
M|You
A|Yeah. They don't do that here. Course they pay them, but they don't, you don't, you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
M|We're not
A|And we only have one. We tore all the rest of them up.
M|Yes, of, have
A|Oh, yeah. I bet that's a pretty nice setup.
M|Well, there is a garage there.
A|Did you scuba dive there?
M|So, we're all just living off of their at their expense.
A|oh, sure, because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
M|Yes, I think I do.
A|Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
M|
A|I, I wasn't helping them. I worked with them, not to help them, but for my own purposes. I'm, I'm a linguist and I was, uh, doing a language, trying to learn their language, a little bit. And I actually, um, I mean, helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me. But I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
M|Uhhh, I think we've all been there.
A|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|And the insurance is on her.
A|No.
M|Uh, how do you know that?
A|Well, uh, I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers, and I don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective. Uh, I think this "me" generation has gone far too far. And the young people are overly impressed. And I think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint.
M|It's probably not a bad idea.
A|I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. So it's worked pretty well. There's, I don't really think anything's been broken. Every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.
M|H
A|Because everyone gains from it.
M|Oh.my.god.hahaha
A|Yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at eight o'clock here, that wouldn't start at seven. We have, um, at seven o'clock we just have, um, the, they'll play, you know, they have old reruns of CHEERS or something from seven to seven thirty, and then something else from seven thirty to eight
M|No. No, no. It's Japanese.
A|What about you?
M|It was the first thing I thought of.
A|Oh, well, that's great.
M|I love.
A|Right.
M|But it's not an airplane, it's a fuel tanker.
A|I mean, these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like.
M|I think,
A|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M|It's not.
A|Yeah. Uh-huh. We did that too,
M|
A|and that's not really beneficial, so, uh I don't have time like that
M|Why not on the weekend?
A|Oh, yeah. I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M|That.
A|Yeah, yeah.
M|I'm going to say it. The cats.
A|My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now. She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California, and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her, and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, and, uh,
M|I think it's.
A|No, my husband does.
M|Do you play classical flutes?
A|Taco Bueno, right, uh-huh.
M|I go
A|I just think that everybody ought to do it.
M|But... the company is still a part of the company.
A|It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, and you slept on the train at night.
M|They're
A|What, uh, is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
M|You're the one who's downvoting me, I'm telling you what I think
A|Yeah, we, we've been married for two and a half years. We've been trying for about two years but no luck yet.
M|
A|but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good.
M|I don't want to make any promises, but I'm going to take a bath with a bath.
A|Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh. Right, because they're a danger to everybody else. Huh, that's interesting. I have to, uh agree with that.
M|... what?
A|I would love that.
M|I know.
A|Yeah.
M|Yeah, I know.
A|Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.
M|You don't have any proof.
A|All right.
M|Uhhh, I'm sorry?
A|Uh-huh.
M|You are in the area?
A|Uh-huh.
M|Uuh, uh, she?
A|Did you?
M|I'm going crazy
A|Uh-huh.
M|I'm sure you'll be happy.
A|So, um, well, I have not really paid much attention because I clock, although I think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with P C
M|No, it was not.
A|Yeah. Have you ever used, do you use WordPerfect ever? Have you ever used WordPerfect? Or,
M|I
A|Well, I have this new fondue pot and I was going to do basic cheese fondue, and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham and I was going to try something weird which, you know, when you have fish au gratin, I was going to make some, uh, like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue. I don't know if it will come out.
M|I do that all the time, and it works.
A|Yeah, I know.
M|I'm a pilot and I work in the military, so.
A|and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.
M|Do you know how much time I have to wait to buy my guns?
A|Uh-huh.
M|It's actually pretty neat.
A|Yeah. Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know, and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.
M|What do you mean, you think it's not a good time
A|Uh-huh, huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that.
M|Uhhh, I know.
A|Uh-huh.
M|There is no way you read that, you should be ashamed.
A|and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
M|So, uh, do we have any other food?
A|Yeah.  Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
M|Yeah, uh, that's not the same.
A|so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.
M|i know.
A|Yeah.
M|.
M|She's so kind.
