A|so I would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby.
M|I'll have to pass on that, but I'll be getting it back.
A|I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
M|It's not a connection. It's a city
A|that's the problem I have with it, in Texas they think it's and all and be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
M|I think he was joking
A|Uh-huh.
M|Yes.
A|A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too. That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
M|I, and
A|You know my husband's always got it on.
M|That's not it, that's just a reference to the episode.
A|I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
M|
A|But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail, that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know. I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
M|You're welcome
A|Oh.

M|Oh.uhh
A|Okay.
M|I'm not sure.
A|Oh that's, wow. Yeah.
M|I'm gonna cry.
A|Yeah, I've done that once or twice. I didn't look at the clock when we started talking, so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in.
M|You don't.
A|Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.
M|Well I'm a boy scout.
A|And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing, but, mom went an,
M|but I don't.
A|but then it depends on who you are calling on. Who you're, you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.
M|I have.
A|Uh-huh.
M|New York Yankees.
A|Okay.

A|No, no I think the um sometimes I guess what did I read recently the um the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. And there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.
