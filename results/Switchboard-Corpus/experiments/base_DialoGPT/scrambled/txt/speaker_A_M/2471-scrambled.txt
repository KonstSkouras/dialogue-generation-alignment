A|my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum, so we can't, can't ever recycle them. I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
M|Are you in the area?
A|And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed. Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
M|that, and,,
A|Right now, both of us are students.
M|Well, you know what to do, huh?
A|I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything. Uh, I am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts and, uh, I'm over the northeast part of Dallas. It's a, in a nice neighborhood. The houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.
M|We're in, uh, the process.
A|Is that a nice vacation spot?
M|He was talking to me.
A|So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,
M|i,
A|Yep.
M|You could be.not.not.
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|It really is.
M|I think in this case it's just more of a deterrent.
A|Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.
M|How much?
A|Uh-huh. Health food, uh, restaurants that,
M|So, you know, they
A|Uh-huh.
M|I know
A|But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. I don't, a lot of that's that recyclable steel and I don't know anybody that takes that.
M|What do you mean?
A|And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
M|It's the whole point of the article.
A|I don't want to play strike out, you know.
M|It's okay, I'm a second generation, I was raised by my father.
A|Yeah, Yeah.
M|What did they say?
A|Yep.
M|u
A|Yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times
M|Because the world is full of people that don't know how to do that.
A|and I don't have that in my current operation, but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.
M|uuh, uh, charge, they pay, charge
A|Uh-huh.
M|Hehehe, yeah.
A|And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling  to be doing that.
M|That's what I said.
A|She lives in Garland and I'm not sure where, what she does. But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
M|The US.
A|Yes.  Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.
M|That's uh, that's the thing, isn't it?
M|They look like a.
