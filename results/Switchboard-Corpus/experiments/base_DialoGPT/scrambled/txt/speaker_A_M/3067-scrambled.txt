A|Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.
M|She nods.
A|Right, and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, they just can't do it.
M|I see
A|and I really, you know, they don't understand, uh, how other people live, um, they don't understand,
M|
A|Uh, that God because, *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
M|It's fine
A|they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
M|You're
A|Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh, some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go, and it's sleeping time. But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either
M|The'n' we.not.they.not.
A|Well, that's not what I heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
M|It's... a bit small.
A|Yeah.
M|And then you get to be a little girl and get to hang out with them.
A|And they had, I was just thinking about one the other day. Uh, if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, um, but they did the Johnny Angel. They did Johnny Elway to that.
M|I'm
A|Yeah.
M|You don't think I'm liberal?
A|No, no, I haven't. Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition. So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.
M|Is it good?
A|Yeah.
M|
A|you can't get all of us.
M|...
A|Uh-huh. Huh. Uh-huh.
M|Most places do.
A|Uh-huh. Well, how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow? I wonder if that's possible? I guess the judge's time is worth too much, though.
M|Yes, of course
A|You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
M|I know, right?
A|uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
M|So you do the same thing, and then you microwave it?
A|Look professional
M|They are done
A|So, you know, it's just,
M|Umm, I'm not really sure.
A|Okay.
M|I think, if you're going to be that guy, it's, like, if, uh, the East side of the Mississippi, it should be the East Side of the State.
A|Uh-huh.
M|Ah. Cool.
A|Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything, we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday, it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog. It was like, oh, that could be it.
M|Ugh, uh.
A|Okay, it does sound like you have some children to take care of
M|I have seen this.
A|Uh-huh.
M|
A|Well, I guess then, I will go, but I,
M|I'm sorry.
A|I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.
M|Are you guys in Oregon?
A|I like the course, but I don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.
M|I'm not sure.
A|Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so. So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days. But I, ,
M|That's not a bad idea.
A|What next?
M|You can, but I don'think it's going to be a lot of people getting involved.
A|I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.
M|No, but they can be used for this purpose.
A|Oh.
M|It's...
A|and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
M|So uh, what's the point of having a computer?
A|and, uh, this man was accused of killing, uh, I think it was two people, uh, and shooting a, uh, policeman, um, point blank in the face. Of course he didn't die.
M|
A|but I, someone, I don't know, it ended up I got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
M|Yeah, I'm gonna have to do that.
A|Uh-huh. Yeah.
M|I know she's not in a relationship, but I don't care.
A|but we feel she's much safer where she is now. She still continues to fall, but when she does there, a nurse is right there to help her
M|Ohhhh... That's a good point.
A|But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
M|What are you gonna do?
A|Uh-huh.
M|The price of oil is higher in the US than in the UK.
A|Our anger is going to have to, to give rise to, to more activity on our part.
M|Yes.but what
A|Yeah, yeah. Me neither. And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
M|It's a good thing you're not a criminal
A|Can bring them in.
M|I mean, if you wanted to, I could get away from it.
A|I mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,
