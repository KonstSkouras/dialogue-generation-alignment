B|Yeah, and spend a day doing, that's really neat. I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time, but you know, every little bit helps.
M|
B|Oh, is that right?
M|But, uh, they're so fast.
B|Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
M|Uhhh, did you go to the E O?
B|Yeah.
M|Yeah, true
B|Oh, yeah.
M|... Is she?
B|Oh, boy.
M|Yup, we have a few fish that are, uh, pretty rare.
B|So what's a guy to do?
M|Yeah, my daughter graduated from High School.
B|and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
M|Uhhh, talk to me, you know.
B|Well that sounds kind of dumb.
M|Oh, uh huh.
B|and I know it, there is, it's very easy to get, uh, uh, you know, there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that,  which aren't the, I, I don't consider to be the kind of crime, uh,  weapon, you know,
M|
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|We could have
B|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, wow. We like the stuff that glitters
M|Well, you know, I'm not a crazy person.
B|Yeah.  I could see that, then maybe.
M|Ugh, no.
B|The basics. Right. Yeah. That's what we do too.
M|Well I have two dogs and a cat.
B|Uh, it, there's some trees like the oaks, like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy. There's, nothing bothers them. Their leaves are still green, and some of the other oaks. There are a few oaks that have lost their leaves. Um, what I notice mostly is the red maples, that the leaves are just dead, the dogwoods still look, still look, you know, they got, uh, bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit, but they still look pretty good.
M|, and,
B|Hello.
M|I'm sure, it's been a long time.
B|On the other hand, you sure, you know, they sure created a, a wonderful breed, I mean a wonderful breed.
M|I'm... I'm not sure, you know, how it works.
B|And you're more receptive.
M|Uhm... I'm not sure if you're asking me, but I can try.
B|but I don't know. He, he's, he, the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his, my brother plays, and, um, I don't, I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know, it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something, you know.
M|I'm sorry, I don't know.
B|And, uh, I read it and really liked it and then about, that is when it really got big. And, uh, so I,
M|What's wrong?
B|to Okay. And I don't know what the solution is.
M|I mean, we've had some stuff like that, but we're not really the most common kind of people.
B|I'm trying to think. Both, um, let's see they start, um, EVENING SHADE at seven and then it goes to, um, what is it after EVENING, um,
M|I'm gonna have to try this. I don't have any friends that play golf.
B|I only have one other person I know in my, in my group here that works where the wife stays home, and that's because of religious values as well. They're Baptists and they, and they think that's important.
M|
B|Oh, okay. Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. That's why I was just
M|Yeah, it's pretty easy to find a stick shift car in America.
B|Hi.
M|I'm so sorry
B|But, uh mine was a year old,
M|You're right. I think it's because it's a tomatos.
B|And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
M|You.
B|Uh-huh.
M|Have a good day!
B|And what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect. And they bred a dog that I it's called a, an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you. That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them, because they would turn on on their handlers.
M|Oh.
B|It was bred out of several different retrievers, and they bred it for companionship and, uh, uh, disposition and, and ability to hunt. It was kept only by kings.
M|Uhh, I would think it would be at least five in the evening.
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's been a while huh?
B|but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment. So, we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon.
M|Travel expenses.
B|Well, same here. Thanks for calling.
M|Well, I came from Texas, and my mother was from Florida
B|yeah, yeah it, it really is, uh, but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.
M|It is in fact, the only thing that is not free is the service station.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I, wouldn't,
B|Uh-huh
M|He's not a big guy.
B|Yeah, I have got some of those too, cause I love flowers
M|I don't know, I don't really have any friends
B|she doesn't have a brown nose, and her she's sort of unicolor, you know, eyes are the same color and everything,
M|Uhh... how?
B|you just like, I don't want that person sharing the Earth with me, you know, I mean, that is just terrible.
M|You
B|Yeah. Probably that's true. But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
M|It's not.
B|you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff but, but I think they're really neat and, you know, I think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
M|The police have been known to do things.
B|Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business.
M|Yes.
B|You too.
M|i have the problem of the cat being in the same room
B|Well, it was good talking to you too.
M|Oh, it's not that bad.
B|What about like those grocery bags?
M|Yeah but it's not the same.
B|Right. Right.
M|I
B|and their economy is, of several of the countries, especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable. It's just a, you know, such a small amount, and it it just, it, uh, cuts off just a trickle, and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, that will be another big problem.
M|It's the same as how we treat everyone else.
B|Really? Huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient.
M|Hey, thanks for the time.
B|Yeah, well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
M|I think the point of this is that it makes people think it's a good idea to buy drugs.
B|I know they lost, yeah, to Washington and Philadelphia.
M|They are on the rise in the area.
B|Uh, but,
M|Why would you do that?
B|It was same time period, yes.
M|yeah she likes to eat.
B|Well, I guess I better go.
M|I have the.
B|it would get snatched right off your arm
M|I'm?
B|So I guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier I guess.
M|I think you mean family.
B|Yeah.
M|What if they can't afford it?
B|Me too.
M|I don't have any money.
B|Uh-huh.
M|You
B|Uh-huh.
M|The appeal is that it takes a year or so to get to the next appeal.
B|Yeah.
M|I'll
B|Yeah.
M|State of Minnesota.
B|Very old, uh, historical place there.
