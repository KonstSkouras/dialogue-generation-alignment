B|And, uh.  The thing about it, you know, now that I've found, is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE, there's nothing in it you don't know.
M|And I know the farmer who goes there.
B|the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh,

M|You can
B|Yeah, uh, I was
M|So what's your opinion on musicals?
B|and oh, my husband just died.
M|How do you do that?
B|Oh, I don't like nineties.
