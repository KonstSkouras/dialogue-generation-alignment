B|Right. There's, there, this topic is kind of mute. Uh
M|
B|Um.
M|
B|Uh-huh.
M|Where is the West part of Florida?
B|and we subcontracted it out ourselves. We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
M|Why do you feel like you have more control of the car than you do?
B|Okay.
M|You know, that is true.
B|I'd, I would agree, with that even more, I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but I'm really offended,  by the thought that I have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
M|We
B|So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice.
M|Yeah.I think I know where you live.
B|For, for honest mistakes where they've done something and, and something happens. One of their employees causes damage or something.  Sure. That's what they buy insurance for.
M|I don't think so.
B|Especially if they're found guilty of the crime.
M|No, I'm sorry.
B|And I do, I don't have a sprinkler system. I, I don't enjoy watering.
M|This is the first time I've seen a video that doesn't have a beter.
B|Yeah.
M|It was outside.
B|Yeah.
M|You're fading me out.
B|So you,
M|I see, well that's good.
B|no, no, but I have had some times when I've had some pretty good balances on there and, uh, you know, I finally, you know, paid them all off and thought this is, you know, kind of nonsense. So, we don't, uh, have big balances on them at, all now we're, we're, you know, we, I use it occasionally but I pay it right off. We're ...
M|Uuh, I don't.
B|Right
M|I, think, you, know, I, don't.
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's because you're not getting any benefits
B|Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M|But why?
B|it's,
M|I can't tell what you like.
B|Yeah,  yeah.
M|Well, you can say it's beautiful.
B|Oh.
M|I have heard the song before.
B|Exactly,
M|We're not too worried about that.
B|And I feel when my children were very young, I had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. And I long ago decided I'm a better mother because I work outside the home.
M|I mean, it's, no
B|Uh-huh.
M|It's called a garage
B|And they had misclassed the sex of back there and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies, and I took the baby and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like, half the price of a mouse,
M|They're blooming right now.
B|Uh-huh.
M|I don't have any experience with that, but I'm sure it's something you can learn.
B|Uh-huh. No, I,
M|,What.Oh
B|I'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something
M|Tiberius is the puppy and the dog.
B|That's kind of sad. Well, anyway.
M|
B|But I, I'm interested in a lot of that, but, uh, I have got a lot of books that I, I intend to read, but I have not been able to yet, you know, for one reason or another.
M|Hmmm. Yeah. You're. I don't, uh.
B|like who knows, you know.
M|I'd say the Pensaclippers are the most expensive team in the state.
B|Yeah our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to, let's see, now, I forget which way we do it. We don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,
M|The government is a pretty good place to start.
B|Well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death
M|What?
B|I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
M|They're called'rood
B|And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
M|I'm not sure, I've been pretty depressed about the last few years.
B|And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big one for me.  Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.
M|Why, because it's a dentist?
B|If you're, like I've, I work with, uh, computer systems a lot. So it's kind of hard to say, you know. If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down, you know Yeah, you did a great job. But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers, you know.  Or do design studies or something.
M|Well, I guess it was the first time in the world.
B|Well.
M|He was a builder.
B|Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh
M|I'ma
B|And it would be just,
M|Yes.
B|Right. Oh, I understand
M|I've seen them breed with a golden retriever.
B|Yeah, I have a garden but you know, we have a garden.
M|I'm not, I'm a law abiding gun owner.
B|Uh-huh. Yep, we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life, but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
M|Well, you were a little too, uh, big.
B|Exactly. Uh-huh. Uh, I don't know. I, uh, you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, falsely accused but, uh, more than likely the people that are on the, the jury know what they're doing. Uh, I mean you,
M|Well, I have fun with you.
B|Well I don't mind that too much
M|you
B|because I I think, what do you have there? It's a house,
M|Yourself.She's
B|Right.
M|I
B|But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
M|I know! I've been to Disneyland!
B|Uh-huh.  No, even that, that really, I think, I don't, it's been awhile since I've looked at, my youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers. But they are
M|you.
B|Uh-huh. Right.
M|I
B|But I don't know much about camping in Texas.
M|Yeah, but that's a four eighty six for six Hundred.
B|It is, and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, uh, built
M|That's why I always, uh, plan for the future.
B|And I do like them. And I'd like to have a compact disc player in the car. That would be,  something that I would really like.
M|You're welcome.
B|Uh-huh.
M|You
B|It's a two story colonial, which my wife and I designed.
M|I've been around since the beginning.
B|And,
M|You can't have kids if you don't have a sense of humor.
B|Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about.
M|How about food?
B|Well, we're Catholics. I came from a family of five. I had four brothers,
M|This is awesome.
B|Right. There for a while, that would, that worked. We've, uh, I know I have, um, I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.
M|It's not, it's just a cucumber.
B|Huh?
M|Well, I mean, you are the one who's the one, right?
B|Oh, oh, you are?
