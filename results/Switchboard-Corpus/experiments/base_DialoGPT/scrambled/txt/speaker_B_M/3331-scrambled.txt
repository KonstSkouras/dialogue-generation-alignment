B|Right, I, I usually see her a, couple times a year so that's no, no big thing. But, uh, I, uh, I do, I do enjoy the reunions. The only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's
M|Nope, no
B|Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.
M|Awwww. My Nissan.
