A:	if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.
M:	Uh uh
A:	Yeah. And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
M:	Yes. You can't get too much more, right?
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a little more of a chore.but, I'm trying to get out of it
A:	Exactly.
M:	Because I'm lazy
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah.It's
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh.my.god.hahaha
A:	Uh-huh
M:	Yea I know.
A:	Uh-huh, you'd just do it.
M:	What's a lasagna?
A:	.
M:	Uh, can I just do that?
A:	Yeah.
M:	You wanna do something?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yea. That is pretty much what it is.
A:	Um. Boy I like that.
M:	I was hoping for a little bit of a story, but we're going to do lasagna, garlic bread, and lasagna.
A:	Yeah, well I'm planning a, and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
M:	You like lasagna?
A:	So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
M:	Huh. Well, that's interesting.
A:	Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
M:	I was gonna say that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well... have you done any?
A:	Yeah, that's fun. Uh-huh.
M:	So... yeah, it's fun
A:	Yeah.
M:	So uh, what's the point of having a computer?
A:	Yeah, that's a good idea.
M:	We should have a separate food truck.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you like the potato salad?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	How about you?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... it's
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	uhh.uhuh.uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	You're a great, great, wonderful person.
A:	Yeah, that's good. Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
M:	Heh, I love it.
A:	It's very easy to.
M:	I don't know if you've heard of this but I don'think you can do that.
A:	You don't like it?
M:	Yeah, I don'like that.
A:	Oh, you do, okay, yeah. I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
M:	Ah. Well, I don't really like it.
A:	and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want, and then you just.
M:	You can't just'put'the chicken into the pan. You have to'put it in'it '.
A:	Yeah, over uncooked rice
M:	You mean rice?
A:	and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.
M:	And you can microwave it
A:	It fluffs up, and it's really moist.
M:	I've never seen it like that before. How is it?
A:	Uh-huh, wow, yeah.
M:	i think it's just a weird coincidence.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I'll keep that one in mind.
M:	You'll get the same result when you cook it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You mean to say...
A:	Yeah.
M:	... I don't know...
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,
M:	I don't know.
A:	or, you know semi .
M:	I mean you can't really do that with a spoon
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, if you wanted to, I could get away from it.
A:	Yeah. You put in, um
M:	But... I don't have any.
A:	let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice or,
M:	I think so.Let's see
A:	It depends on, you can really vary it.
M:	I dont know, how many cups of rice?
A:	But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.
M:	I don't think I've ever had a cup of water in a bath.
A:	Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I mean, you can't really'use'it for that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Mmmmmm, taste.
A:	Um, let's see. I think it was an hour. I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.
M:	Oh, I know. It's a little... spicy.
A:	Yeah. But, I think it's about an hour.
M:	So you do the same thing, and then you microwave it?
A:	Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
M:	That's a great idea. I'll do it
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, it's just chicken.
A:	Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
M:	Yeah, I'm gonna have to do that.
A:	Yeah, I liked your idea too, there.
M:	Yea.I'll have to see what I can do.It's a bit hard to make the cooking go a little quicker
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But... it's not a soup.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Ummm... How do you make soup?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a thing
