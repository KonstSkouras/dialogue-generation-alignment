M:	I'm in Georgia.
A:	Okay. Yeah.
M:	I'm not the one who owns the house.
A:	No, that's okay
M:	So, what's your home address?
A:	Okay.
M:	It's not like that.
A:	Oh, that's neat.
M:	They're not.
A:	Wow, that's large
M:	I'm in the UK. We have an airbnb
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's... a bit small.
A:	Oh, well, that's not too bad,
M:	How old?
A:	that's still fairly new.
M:	They're actually not that old.
A:	Well,
M:	Well, we do have a few of the top ten hospitals in the country.
A:	Oh, you're kidding Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there, I mean, what it's,
M:	I don't, I'm just saying it's the cheapest in the world, but,
A:	Okay.
M:	I'm not the one who's selling it.
A:	It, it sounds like, I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
M:	What's a house?
A:	I mean, Dallas is a very marked up area, although right now it's a lot lower um, because of all the layoffs and everything
M:	What? No, it's not.
A:	the economy around here is real poor
M:	I don't know if I'd say the economy around Dallas is really that bad, but it's not like there's a huge shortage of jobs.
A:	Well, no, not really
M:	is it bad that i was thinking of a different place?
A:	Um, the area itself, uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, um, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments
M:	What happened to Fort Worth?
A:	Um, there's been tremendous amounts of, of, uh, layoffs so, really housing is real bad. The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad, but housing is still real bad
M:	Ugh, I'm so glad you said this.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you?
A:	Yeah. This is,
M:	This is real
A:	Oh.
M:	Yeah. I live in Pensacolos.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh. Well. I'm not really sure.
A:	Oh.
M:	We did.
A:	Wow.
M:	That's why we don't have them.
A:	So, do you think, it was overdeveloped then?
M:	No, it was not.
A:	Wow.
M:	We do have the most.
A:	Um.
M:	The only thing that's been a problem for me is the number, so I think it's a good deal.
A:	Um yeah. Yeah.
M:	Are you saying that the current build
A:	Well, right now we're just renting, but it is a home. Um,
M:	
A:	it's a four bedroom home It has about, I guess, eighteen hundred square feet It's on one floor
M:	... what?
A:	Uh, we have no basement I don't know,
M:	Uhh, uh, uh.we're not in a basement
A:	Okay I wasn't sure. Most of the ones, you know, up north and everything do, but, um, anyway, it's, uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area. Most of this area was developed, this house was built in seventy-four.
M:	I don't, I don't, I have no idea.
A:	So most of the, it's almost twenty years old, and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style Uh, we have a friend that lives two blocks over, and his house is almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
M:	Yeah, um
A:	but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. So I, I think most of them are there was, it, like most areas that are built, um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from
M:	...
A:	And, and, uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, for probably a square mile, I'd say, at least, maybe even a little bit more than that.
M:	yeah,
A:	Where are you in relation to Sevren? are you close to Sevren?
M:	I,,
A:	Okay.
M:	What about Sevren
A:	Well, I just,
M:	I don't know.
A:	I have a sister that used to live in Sevren.
M:	What is that?
A:	And they bought their home in I, I want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that, and they paid like, they, they had it built from, you know, they, they designed it and everything, and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it, and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
M:	I can't say I've ever heard of a home builder.
A:	Yeah, so I just wondered, you know, if the whole area was like that or,
M:	I'm sure
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why?
A:	Um.
M:	I think
A:	Yeah.
M:	... I... I just saw the second one...
A:	Sounds like a lot of money though
M:	I've got a lot.
A:	sure. Yeah.
M:	Can you imagine spending that many on something that's not a game?
A:	Right. Oh, yeah.
M:	Well, it's only the most expensive one.
A:	Wow. Yeah.
M:	
A:	Wow Wow, that's,
M:	I have you pay a million dollars.
A:	Really? That much of a difference?
M:	The house is in my town, and I live in the town of the same name.
A:	Wow.
M:	Oh, absolutely.
A:	Yeah
M:	That's really, really sad.
A:	Wow. Why is that? Do you know? I mean
M:	It's sad
A:	Uh-huh
M:	So, what are you saying?
A:	Oh.
M:	Yeah. It's the reason why I live in Florida.
A:	Oh
M:	I'd like to see a picture of a real job
A:	My goodness
M:	I'm a private school teacher.
A:	Wow
M:	The only way I can be sure
