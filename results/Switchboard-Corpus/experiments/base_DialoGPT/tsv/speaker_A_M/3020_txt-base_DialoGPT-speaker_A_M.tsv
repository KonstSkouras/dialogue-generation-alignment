M:	... we
A:	Oh that's, wow. Yeah.
M:	Kau
A:	Oh I've I've been lots of places. My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess  we, that one would count ,
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	Uh, that was about a year and a half ago, and,
M:	I have been in Morocco and there was a lot of people there.
A:	Uh, well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time
M:	I'm sorry, what?
A:	and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet. And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier
M:	Uhm...
A:	and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.
M:	Uhhh
A:	We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
M:	So
A:	And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed. We do a lot of traveling around. We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
M:	Oh okay.
A:	No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was,
M:	Is it cold?
A:	well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,
M:	We weren't in the snow?
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	uh uh
A:	At at, excuse me, at what age did you, Oh, that's too bad because,
M:	I'm
A:	Uh-huh
M:	We're all in a club... uhuh
A:	Yeah. It was a very interesting vacation. The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
M:	No, not you.
A:	and you, there were some places, where people,
M:	Uhhh, there was some places.
A:	there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
M:	Oh yeah.
A:	and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.
M:	I was there, you can see me.
A:	But,
M:	it was all a lie
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	What is the joke?
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a shame they don't have a better way to spend money.
A:	The, the worst place was in Marrakech
M:	I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.
A:	and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
M:	Well, I'm a guy.
A:	it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you.
M:	Why would you do that?
A:	And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
M:	It's a city in a city.
A:	and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,
M:	I have no idea why I am so good at this.
A:	and we were much happier,
M:	But we're not in the UK
A:	and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,
M:	you see that?
A:	Uh
M:	Well it's good to know you're not alone
A:	Yes.
M:	Do you have a home?
A:	No actually I haven't been all through Europe,  like I haven't been to Italy yet.
M:	Have you been to Europe?
A:	Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
M:	I think you are the only one.
A:	Uh, my more exciting spots have been, I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
M:	u TheLolzLizard u thel 0n
A:	Uh-huh, that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.
M:	We'll be there in September, I think.
A:	Yes. If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.
M:	I'm glad you like it.
A:	If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest But it, that was really, really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
M:	I'm a little bit jealous.
A:	Um, August, eighty-eight.
M:	What year?
A:	And then, actually, after there I went to um, Hawaii, a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
M:	It's in September.
A:	and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China,
M:	I went to the same place, and then went to a different place, but then went back to Hawaii.
A:	I, I, actually I didn't go diving.
M:	ohhh yeah.
A:	I, I'm a diver and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
M:	Uh, I'm not a diver.
A:	but, uh, no I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef. I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide.
M:	Did you go to the great barrier reef?
A:	It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. The coastline was just incredible. It's huge.
M:	Hmmm, I think I might go there.
A:	Australia. Yeah.
M:	You mean the great barrier reef?
A:	Uh, but,
M:	The coast of Australia.
A:	I don't remember if I had shrimp.
M:	You don't have shrimp?
A:	I don't think so.
M:	I'm in Australia.
A:	Oh, I like that too. But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
M:	That's not really how it works.
A:	But, uh,
M:	No, no, it's not that fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You're adventurous.
A:	And I was by myself in China too.
M:	I was in China
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm not seeing you
A:	China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge. But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,
M:	That's not a bad idea.
A:	and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
M:	Oh. I'm not sure.
A:	No, actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, no maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare and,  but this is from Hong Kong,
M:	Hong Kong
A:	because I was already in Hong Kong and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride.
M:	
A:	And that, I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. It was really,
M:	you.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... and what about how do you?
A:	Around a thousand.
M:	I'm sorry, how much did you make?
A:	Oh, Japan's ridiculous.
M:	There are some places where it's not that expensive, and I live in Japan.
A:	And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in, they were all completely clean,
M:	I stayed in Japan, it was like this
A:	and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
M:	They're not even that expensive
A:	Right. Right.
M:	Yup. It's all about the money
A:	Uh, but yeah, that was, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
M:	China
A:	Yeah. Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
M:	Can you do that?
A:	and then,
