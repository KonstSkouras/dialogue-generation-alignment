M:	I think I'm just gonna...
A:	Yeah.
M:	H, uh, I guess.
A:	Huh.
M:	I think it's because it's a big house.
A:	It sounds nice.
M:	I'm going to start a new post for this, if you're interested.
A:	Oh, yeah?
M:	It is.
A:	Yeah. Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
M:	I know.
A:	And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
M:	Because, the economy
A:	I'm building my own house.
M:	What is your problem with them?
A:	And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
M:	I am in the same situation.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Do you live in the back of the house?
A:	Yeah.
M:	You mean the truck?
A:	I used to be a builder.
M:	??? You're a new player
A:	And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
M:	Yeah.You?
A:	And now I'm a college educated builder  There's still no work, you know.
M:	Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm still here.
A:	So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did.
M:	I know, right?
A:	And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
M:	I have a friend who's a lawyer, he's going to sue you for this.
A:	You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
M:	Can you borrow money to buy your own house?
A:	Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
M:	What's the point of having a bank then?
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
M:	The bank is paying for it.
A:	Well.
M:	I don't have a bank.
A:	As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?
M:	That's why they call it a bag.
A:	Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
M:	We have no money to buy.
A:	But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to.
M:	I think you're misunderstanding the question.
A:	Yeah. Well, I figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so I want  to have a shop.
M:	You do you, ummm, have you tried any other hobby?
A:	Ten acres.
M:	Do you have a lot of plants?
A:	Well, yeah. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill.
M:	I like the look of it.
A:	And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. Seriously.
M:	He's right.
A:	Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy but, you know, he's
M:	What do you mean?
A:	I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
M:	Not in the sun.
A:	And, uh,
M:	And, uh, uh
A:	Yeah. Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
M:	Well, how about you?
A:	Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
M:	How do you like your...
A:	And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
M:	I'll make a fire.
A:	But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
M:	It's not that. It's the wood burning.
A:	and I have not had to use the heat.
M:	You've been using the heat?
A:	Because it's all geothermal.
M:	Why is the air so cold?
A:	And with all the, see I've got, on the south side is all glass. Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
M:	I have seen this.
A:	I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. So it's almost all glass.
M:	No, the west side is a lot more green.
A:	And, uh,
M:	I think, if you're going to be that guy, it's, like, if, uh, the East side of the Mississippi, it should be the East Side of the State.
A:	Oh, yeah. I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M:	I've always wondered why I've never seen any windows in my house.
A:	So, uh,
M:	I like windows.
A:	Well, not really. It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
M:	Is that the only door?
A:	So the first, you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
M:	What is the second floor?
A:	And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
M:	You know what?
A:	So I've got a pretty good grade there.
M:	He nods.
A:	And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
M:	I think you'll find it's a very confusing shop.
A:	Exactly.
M:	I'm going to make a joke about it. I'm going out on a limb and saying that this is a Victorian shop.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You can see the little shelf for the back of the shop in the picture.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, you know, I'm a human.
