M:	Sorry.
A:	So it was pretty much a physical decision?
M:	Oh yeah, she was there.
A:	Um.
M:	She's uh, in a good shape.
A:	Yeah.
M:	She was in the hospital?
A:	My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult. Was she in favor of it or, or was she kind of opposed to it?
M:	She's still in the process of being brought back.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	She's just... ugh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	She was.
A:	So often I think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad. I work with a lot of elderly people, I'm a trust officer
M:	Yep.
A:	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
M:	You know, sometimes I think elderly people are better than they are.
A:	Yes.  Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.
M:	But... they're not.
A:	It really is.
M:	I don't think that's a fair comparison.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, you like them?
A:	Yeah.
M:	It is.Oh yeah.uhhuh
A:	And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals. I do that right now,
M:	Yeah, and the food is so small.
A:	and I'm not near nursing home age.
M:	I'm not from Europe.
A:	Yeah.  Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
M:	You know, I'm sure I'd rather be in a nursing home than a hospital.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhhhhuh....
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhh, I'm.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	She's a lady, she can stay out of the way.
A:	Oh yeah. That's a given.
M:	I have seen people who are working at the place in the house and are looking for a new place.
A:	Uh-huh.   And sometimes the, the help there does it, I think.
M:	I dunno, sometimes it's just weird.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think you'll find they're not all that busy
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh... and uh...
A:	Adapt.
M:	That's what I was saying.
A:	Yeah.  I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people. Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money  but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
M:	
A:	They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
M:	You're...
A:	and, and they do group things. And then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh, I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in. It's really kind of difficult.
M:	I
A:	Yeah.
M:	... we.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... men... uh, I...
A:	Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.
M:	you mean they don t get outta the house?
A:	You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and, and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
M:	Oh. I thought it was a new thing.
A:	They, they became, in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. And that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
M:	Emotions.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm gonna cry.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Why would I?
A:	Not as independence.
M:	But there is no other way to play.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You are in the area?
A:	Uh-huh.   Uh-huh.
M:	That's a good point.
A:	Yeah. And the quality of life really isn't there.
M:	They are not the only ones who get the job.
A:	Oh it's tough, it really is.
M:	I know. I'm a woman.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I am.
A:	Well, they fear being dependent  on somebody.
M:	Why do they fear having children?
A:	They, they fear being a burden to, to family members.
M:	Why do they have so many kids?
A:	My husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation. She'll let something slip and we'll say, wait a minute. And, and that's it, she, just, well I didn't want to bother you. She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
M:	Why? What is the reason?
A:	Yeah. Well, she stayed, she stayed in a temporary nursing home.  Until she was okay.
M:	Did you have to leave?
A:	You know, it's just, but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her. She's down in Temple
M:	Is she ok?
A:	and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
M:	She's a nurse.
A:	So, it's difficult, it really is and we're all heading that way and,
M:	I don't know, it's hard to see her.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We're in College station
A:	Yeah
