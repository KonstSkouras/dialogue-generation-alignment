M:	Oh? What do you think about it?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Don't you mean the game?
A:	Right.
M:	You know, I usually have to check things.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuhuh. Uhuh.
A:	Of course, uh-huh.
M:	And we've been saying this for a long time, but we've never had it work, so we've always been able to
A:	Right
M:	Because of the whole, uh, thing?
A:	right, just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
M:	uh, i'm not sure what you mean.
A:	We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.
M:	I agree. I'd rather be poor than have a high cost of living.
A:	Right. Right. And you usually get what you pay for. We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas, and they were like ten dollars, and we expected them to work nice for the little kids, and they didn't work worth anything
M:	You're
A:	So we took those back, and that's about that all that were taken back in ages.
M:	I can be fixed, a lot of money.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a brand?
A:	Right.
M:	Yeah, but what about lemon?
A:	Right.
M:	You know what?
A:	Oh, really. It's hard.
M:	The lemon law is pretty difficult to enforce.
A:	Oh, wow.
M:	Yeah. It's a very slow process, but we can't really do anything without a lemon.
A:	Uh-huh, and it just pertained to that
M:	... and it was just, you know, not very
A:	I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy, it seems like, and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there, but, But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,
M:	...
A:	so.
M:	That's not that.
A:	Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
M:	That.
A:	but, but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, I, it's hard to say. Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better.
M:	Ayea
A:	About quality.
M:	Ohh, why you.
A:	Right.
M:	Yeah but I'm, you know, the one that's being made
A:	Yeah, Yeah.
M:	Do you?
A:	Right. Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something, so
M:	I think it's a bit overpriced.
A:	so. So, if we get what we what we deserve
M:	We got what we wanted.
