M:	Are you sure?
A:	Yeah, you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
M:	You know, I voted for a lot of the local candidates.
A:	Right, or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that.
M:	So, you know, they
A:	Yeah, I think you're right.
M:	I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it's a lot.
A:	Yeah, or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,
M:	That's the main reason I dislike it.
A:	so they think, well, you know, why vote.
M:	I'm not sure if they like each other or not.
A:	Yeah, really, especially in Texas
M:	I don't know, maybe it's just a Texas thing?
A:	It really was, yeah.
M:	Well, that's how it's supposed to be.
A:	Yeah Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
M:	Is that a serious problem?
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. Well, it's, it.
A:	Yeah. It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting.
M:	I think it's pretty obvious that this is a bad idea.
A:	Yeah, it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected.
M:	What?
A:	Kind of scary when you think about that.
M:	It's not
A:	Oh, gosh.
M:	Aha! I can't!
A:	Yeah.
M:	Hey, that's the guy who shot the police officer that shot the guy in the
A:	Yeah, people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected.
M:	You're assuming that.
A:	Next thing you know, you've got him.
M:	Well, you've certainly got me there.
A:	Yeah.
M:	If you go to a polling station, you know who is the president of the party.
A:	Right, yeah.
M:	I'm pretty sure you can vote, if you vote for me, I will.
A:	Yeah. Right.
M:	He got elected, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to call him the president.
A:	Yeah, he sure did.
M:	I think he got elected in the wrong state.
A:	Yeah. I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
M:	I like this idea.
A:	I think that discourages a lot of people.
M:	How do you feel about the voting system?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	... uh... What?
A:	Right.
M:	i.know.it.beyond.your.mind
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think there's a reason for you to vote.
A:	Yeah, I'm in Dallas, and they're long here too.
M:	You know what? I'm not a fan of the Cowboys, but they've got a lot of good things going on.
A:	Yeah, I voted absentee one year. I really was going to be gone. So, I did it, but, uh, it was nice. I would be tempted to do it again.
M:	I voted for the first time in my life. I'm not sure I'd be able to do that again.
A:	Right.
M:	I vote yes
A:	Yeah. I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
M:	Why? It's a good idea.
A:	I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
M:	And, it's been a long time since we had a system like that.
A:	Uh-huh,
M:	I'm not that's just,
A:	Yeah, that would be. I usually vote. A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,
M:	, work.
A:	so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.
M:	I vote
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	, I'm sorry.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, you mean that,
A:	No, I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
M:	So... I guess I should
A:	Right, and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
M:	You know.
A:	Yeah.
M:	This isnt a story, its a compilation of what youve heard
A:	Yeah.
M:	Because the media is biased.Not the case with the elections.But we do have elections.They are very important.So.Do.They.Like.it.Much.Much more.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's a joke
A:	Yeah, I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.
M:	It's just a joke.It's not even funny.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	The election has been in the works for a while.
A:	Yeah, the press has a lot of power.
M:	That's true.
A:	Yeah, oh, but, boy you try get into that, you'd really open a can of worms.
M:	You have a point.They have no control over the press, they can't control the press.
A:	Yeah, seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit, and I don't think they ever care to.
M:	I'm not saying they don't, I'm just saying
A:	Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about.
M:	Do you think they care?
A:	Well, it was good talking to you.
M:	I don't like it.
A:	Bye.
M:	Goodbye to you
