A:	Right, as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love. They just give it, and don't expect too much.
M:	I don't think so.
A:	Anyway, do you have a pet?
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Oh! like a
M:	She had a pet, and she's now in a relationship.
A:	Oh, I'm so sorry. But that's good that you're going to get another one.
M:	I just had a kitten.
A:	I know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets. But they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
M:	that,
A:	Yeah, an, and my, my kids,
M:	Food.
A:	um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything I think
M:	I want a lot of course.
A:	but, um, I don't know do you like, I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
M:	He was never in my house, but I do like the cat.
A:	It kind of traveled around travel .
M:	You're a cat?
A:	Yeah, when I had a Cocker Spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog and, uh, I think I liked that better.
M:	Did you know the dog was trained?
A:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	Yes, it's
A:	Yeah, that's true. Take them for walks, right. Yeah, I see all the people on, on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
M:	no.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. So, I
M:	that's
A:	Oh, that's exciting. Yeah.
M:	So
A:	Yeah, I think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
M:	It'shoot.
A:	That, that kind of gripes on me some, but, but I don't know.
M:	It's the same reason you have a pet.
A:	More and more people are,  Right, right.
M:	...
A:	But, uh,
M:	And, uh, I think, you know, and
A:	I think that's really true.
M:	The best part is when you realize it's true.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I'm sorry.
A:	Yeah, exactly.
M:	You're talking about the kittens, right?
A:	Exactly. I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too, and, and that's good too.
M:	It's still a lot better than the community.
A:	Well, I think that's all I have to say.
M:	It's fine.Thanks for the talk though
A:	Okay, have a good night.   All right, bye-bye.
M:	I think it was the same.
