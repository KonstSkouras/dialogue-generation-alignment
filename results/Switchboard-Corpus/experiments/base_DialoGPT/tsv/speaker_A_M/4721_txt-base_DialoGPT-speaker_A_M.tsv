M:	you?
A:	and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really made me feel good.
M:	I love running, I love exercise, I'm a runner, I just like running.
A:	Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
M:	Nope.
A:	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.
M:	congrats.
A:	It is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
M:	That's
A:	It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
M:	What is
A:	and I'm, I'm getting much better. My stamina is getting great for the dance floor  so  I mean it's just,
M:	That's what I mean.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
M:	It's a good game.I like it.It's fun.It's not a chore to play.
A:	It is inside and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
M:	I don't know what's inside, but I like it.
A:	and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
M:	That's a good idea. I'll take it.
A:	I have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
M:	What are you doing for a week?
A:	So I've enjoyed that part of it. Yeah. And at the gym, even in the class, uh, I, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. Everybody's on their way to someplace
M:	I'm
A:	and so, you know, I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
M:	It's not.
A:	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty  so.
M:	Yeah, it's a bit of a problem, but I'm not going to be alone in the gym
A:	There are, there are.  It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah.
M:	Oh, you know.
A:	You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V but you probably wouldn't.
M:	I could probably get a tv in the middle of a city.
A:	So.
M:	Yes.Yes.But.If you have a tape and can't do it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You could also use a tape recorder, maybe.
A:	Yeah,  yeah, I can see it'll be a good break.
M:	yeah, yeah
A:	Right.
M:	He said it
A:	Uh-huh
M:	You're welcome.
A:	I think you do. You feel very good after you exercise.  I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
M:	I feel like I can go back to sleep.
A:	You owe it to yourself
M:	I don't know, I just do.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
M:	I think so.You do.You feel very happy.You are.full of.yourself.For.the.full.time.you are.alone.You have a nice.life.You deserve.it.You owe.it to.it.
A:	And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, I think it's well worth it. I just demand that time for myself. Now I've learned to do that
M:	I think it is.
A:	and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around. So.
M:	Yes, I think I do.
A:	You have to. Because   there's always more things to do.
M:	What is that?
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
M:	Well, I think there's more to it.
A:	and I take it  so.
M:	You dont have to
A:	No, I've done some walking with friends in the past.
M:	Have you?
A:	But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
M:	I do a lot of walking.
A:	and that's not really beneficial, so, uh I don't have time like that
M:	I'm not too sure.
A:	and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
