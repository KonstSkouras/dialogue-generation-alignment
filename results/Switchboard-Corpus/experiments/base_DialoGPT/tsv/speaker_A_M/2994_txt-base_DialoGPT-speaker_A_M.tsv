M:	That's
A:	Yeah. Yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.
M:	
A:	Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.
M:	what
A:	And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags. They won't take those. We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.
M:	I don'ts
A:	And we have to bring the paper bags back every time. Because they won't take them.
M:	
A:	Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up?
M:	We're the recycling center. We're the ones who make paper bags.
A:	Uh-huh. We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though, our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.
M:	What do you mean?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	No, it's not.
A:	Yeah, it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do, but. Do you, um, have any ideas on anything that would make,
M:	Uhhh... I don
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I guess I'm gonna go find some more garbage to pick up.
A:	Right.
M:	I am so confused.
A:	Yeah that would be a good idea.
M:	I'm not sure about the best, but I'm sure I could do it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	What about just sending a few trash cans?
A:	Right. Yeah, that would be a real good motivation for people.
M:	It's a good motivation. I'll be doing it again soon.
A:	Right. Yeah, my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,
M:	I'm back.
A:	and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything, so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.
M:	yes,
A:	Yeah. Yeah that would be a real good idea. I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of. They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our, in our city .
M:	...
A:	Rowlett, Texas.
M:	I'm in Texas. Where are you?
A:	Do you know where that is?
M:	I live in LA
A:	And I don't know if they decided to do, or not, but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that. Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point,  without charging people.
M:	They're still trying to add it, and they have the technology to do it.
A:	Yeah I don't know, uh, I guess it just depends on how they manage it.
M:	Is there any way to change the date of the month?
A:	I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff. The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.
M:	what.
A:	And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.
M:	They do, but I don t think they make enough money to be profitable.
A:	But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. I don't, a lot of that's that recyclable steel and I don't know anybody that takes that.
M:	So...
A:	my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum, so we can't, can't ever recycle them. I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
M:	It's garbage
A:	Yeah, that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler
M:	Steel cans.
A:	But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling.
M:	No, they don't.
A:	It was good talking to you.
M:	Thanks for the talk.
A:	Uh, bye.
M:	See you around.
