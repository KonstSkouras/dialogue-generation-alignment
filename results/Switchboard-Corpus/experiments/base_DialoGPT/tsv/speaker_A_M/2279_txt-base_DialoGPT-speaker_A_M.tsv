A:	Well both of mine are boys. They're eight and eleven
M:	How old are your kids?
A:	and they're into sports
M:	Well, they're both boys.
A:	I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
M:	Well, I mean, I'm not sure if they're gonna be any fun tonight.
A:	Baseball has started.
M:	What is going on in this thread?
A:	Oh, oh, yes, we start here at, uh, five.
M:	I'll be right there with you. I'm going to get a ticket for this.
A:	Up until, it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May.
M:	How many pitches does it take to get a strike out?
A:	So he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching
M:	I'm a pitcher, so...
A:	and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching.
M:	She is the only one who can be a ballplayer.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's not.
A:	But yes, we're into baseball, and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. We even have peewee basketball here. So there's always something.
M:	Oh.my.gosh.
A:	Both. If we're not doing sports we go somewhere.
M:	Do you do anything for the week?
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
M:	You know, we have a lot of friends in this city,
A:	No, usually in the summer time.
M:	How long are you going?
A:	Different places every year. We,
M:	Where do you live?
A:	No
M:	Have you been to a place?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Are you sure?
A:	You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often, and that must be the thing. They really hadn't either. They went to the Memorial, you know, when they go, it's on business
M:	Uhhuh
A:	it's not really just to getting to sight see.
M:	Why do you think that?
A:	Oh, I bet it is, too.
M:	It's not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not sure.
A:	Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places. But our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.
M:	That is what I thought.
A:	Oh, yes, yes, yes.
M:	I think I know you.
A:	Oh.
M:	You know, I never said I was.
A:	Oh,
M:	The real question is, when was the last time you saw a man?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	He said, and then, I.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhh, I think you mean we weren't even a family, uh, before you.
A:	Yes.
M:	Are you going to make the joke about me?
A:	Oh, yes, but we try, you know, I try, my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does
M:	You mean like family?
A:	because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old
M:	Because I'm still alive.
A:	so I always just had a mother. So I always thought, when I have kids, you know, I really want to be involved with them.
M:	We do.
A:	Material things, yes, that is, yes,
M:	Did you have a dad?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's not like I'm making a game out of
A:	Best friends, now.
M:	So, you're saying, he wanted to be friends with you?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	This is sooo weird
A:	Yeah.
M:	Ohhh, it's not the same guy...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's aintros, uhh
A:	Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	we
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think about that.
A:	Yeah, you have to
M:	Do you really have to go out to class to talk to people?
A:	I mean, you honestly do. Now I have friends that I love to death, but, and they have children, but their children does anything, we have to take them, and, you know to do it.
M:	Oh, you know.
A:	And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know.
M:	Yes, and I am so happy I'm not dead.
A:	Yeah, oh, yeah.
M:	That'snot, I have problems
A:	Problem, uh-huh
M:	yeah, say, that, you're, to be a problem,
A:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh, I'm not sure you understand how it works
A:	Uh-huh, yeah, I agree with you very much so. Now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college, and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too
M:	I think
A:	would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.
M:	Yes.but what
A:	Yeah.
M:	but I don't.
A:	Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	I, uh, I have, uh... I have two kids...
A:	That's right, but you can't take this money with us, though
M:	Well, I've got a lot more money now.
A:	that's how I keep looking at it.
M:	I don't have a problem with that.
A:	Oh.
M:	Theres a big difference between how expensive you can make it and how expensive the student loan is.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Umm...?
A:	Oh, yeah, if you if you can, yeah.
M:	So, can.it.be.better.good.the.for.you.better.
A:	Yeah. What are you learning to be?
M:	Yeah, you can get a degree in a few months if you just plan a semester ahead.
A:	What degree, I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college?
M:	I'm a student, but I'm not a student.
A:	Oh, that's, my husband's into, uh, computers.
M:	She laughs. What do you mean, then?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I am, uh, I'm just not home.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Because of?
A:	And you don't want to?
M:	I'm a girl.
A:	No, no.
M:	Do you have a brother?
A:	Oh.
M:	It's a reference to the song'' Get out''
A:	Oh.
M:	Well, I have a good friend who is a lawyer, and he says that he can't go back.
A:	Then you'll never leave.
M:	And I'm not gonna leave
A:	Oh. Uh-huh.
M:	H.
A:	Well maybe something will open up for you.
M:	I dunno, I guess I'll have to see.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you.
M:	I've never been to the meeting.
A:	Okay,  bye-bye.
M:	I'm not going to lie. I'm a bit jealous.
