B:	Have I?
M:	I do.
B:	Uh, no, not actually
M:	You mean to tell me that you have?
B:	Okay.
M:	You have to have some kind of special relationship with me to be an adult.
B:	Right.
M:	So, and you're you're right.
B:	Okay.
M:	How, are.
B:	Right. I, I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.
M:	But...
B:	Exactly,
M:	I don't think you understand how the job market works.
B:	exactly.
M:	It's not that much, just a lot of money.
B:	Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
M:	That's because it's a good way to get your blood pressure up.
B:	Exactly,
M:	You're a lot more likely to get a new doctor if you have an old one.
B:	they always do.
M:	And it's always good to be home
B:	Yeah, I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
M:	A small business company, if you will.
B:	Exactly. You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
M:	I would not.
B:	Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
M:	I wouldnt have to work, just to pay my own rent and food.
B:	Right.
M:	You're
B:	Yeah. Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.
M:	I '
B:	And it would be just,
M:	The world would be a better place if people could be a bit self
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,  center.
M:	I'd say the most likely scenario is that they
B:	Exactly.
M:	So if you're a mom, they'd be deprived?
B:	Besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
M:	How would you know?
B:	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
M:	To be fair, I don't have a choice. I can get up at any time.
B:	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
M:	You are going on the same day, if you are in the exact same place.
B:	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
M:	I think that's what I'd do.
B:	I think I, think it would be fair.
M:	Why not just get a job?
B:	I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
M:	
B:	But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
M:	Yeah, I'd say so.
B:	I think it would be really. really great.
M:	No, but I would
B:	Yeah.
M:	We should just go to the end of the world.
B:	I do.
M:	Not really.
B:	Eye care is good. I do not, I am not I do not think we have that on our policy.
M:	Eye Care.
B:	But, uh, we,
M:	I think we all do.
B:	Yeah. It would be great, I mean, uh, the glasses that, the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.
M:	I have a vision exam on the 19th. I will not be attending.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	No, because you don't have a choice.
B:	Right, now like my ... Right. Well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,
M:	She's got an optician.
B:	Well, she does not have it, but, she is like, on the verge of it or, something.
M:	She has her own problems.
B:	Her eyes are changing,
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	and she has to be tested periodically. And, and those are expensive tests.
M:	she has to go to the hospital, she is going to test her eyes.
B:	Now, I think your insurance covers her on that,
M:	I have to have her eyes tested.
B:	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know, that's,
M:	But it's a good thing!
B:	Right.
M:	right.jpg
B:	Right.
M:	right.
B:	Now, I would like to see better dental insurance to me. Was that our beep?
M:	I would like a chance to see some more of your dental insurance
B:	Oh. Huh.
M:	You know what, you're right.
B:	Okay.
M:	I have no idea
B:	But, with the three children um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
M:	I know.
B:	because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well. For the, the orthodontia stuff.
M:	Why, because it's a dentist?
B:	Yes, it is.
M:	It's not that expensive.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	That's the joke.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Ohh, my bad.
B:	Right. My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
M:	Your middle child has a flat stomach, because she's a pallet.
B:	And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
M:	He was born with a mouth, and therefore, he can't speak.
B:	Right.
M:	Yes. Right.
B:	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars, and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.
M:	Yeah, I was just joking.
B:	Oh.
M:	I read an ad.
B:	Really.
M:	I'm sorry, but I'm not a doctor.
B:	That sounds like it would hurt more.
M:	I was thinking about it.
B:	Oh, gosh. I, I would much rather that, do that, to myself than make my five year old go in and do it. That would kill me.
