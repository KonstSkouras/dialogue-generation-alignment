B:	And I pay a lot of property taxes.
M:	You pay a ton of property tax.
B:	I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services. It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes.

B:	How about you? Do you pay too much?
M:	Well, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.
B:	Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.

M:	You've gone.
B:	And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
M:	Umm...
B:	And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no interest, no repayment schedule.
M:	It '
B:	And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because we're so close to D C anyway.
M:	It's not even close to being a government issue.
B:	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
M:	I'm just curious as to what the real reason is.
B:	Um, I, I, I think we pay too much. And I've, I look at my paycheck and I make, well, let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes
M:	Well, how do you pay for it?
B:	I think I pay forty-two percent.
M:	Uhh, I'm not sure I'm ready for this
B:	Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government, and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes,
M:	How much does the government pay you?
B:	and they charge me all these others, and it's just too expensive.
M:	I know, right? It's like they're not even trying.

M:	I'm a heavy science guy.
B:	Okay. Well maybe, maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's, come rolling towards, whatever it's rolling toward.
M:	I'm a physicist and I can tell you that
