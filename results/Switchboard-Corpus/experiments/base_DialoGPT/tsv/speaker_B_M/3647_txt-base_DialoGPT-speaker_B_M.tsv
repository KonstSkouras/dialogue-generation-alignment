B:	Yes, we're not too long distance today.
M:	Are you guys still going?
B:	Oh, that was good. Utah, I've had a couple of, but that was it.
M:	You must be from the east coast
B:	Yeah.
M:	You know, I'm not too sure.
B:	Learned about their basketball team
M:	Did you learn about the Utah Jazz?
B:	Uh, Jazz.
M:	Which team?
B:	Yeah.
M:	He's a Jazz fan.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well. They were in Utah for a while.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean. Yeah.
B:	I am.
M:	I'm confused.
B:	Okay.
M:	I'm not.
B:	Nancy.
M:	You mean to say what?
B:	Right.
M:	I'm not sure who you are.
B:	Right.
M:	I'm Brian.
B:	Right.
M:	I don't think I can give you a job.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.
M:	Are you going to be able to pay for yourself?
B:	I'm a nurse and I work,
M:	I don't know. What's your job?
B:	I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
M:	It's because you're not getting any benefits
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
M:	Ah, so you have to pay more than the cost of the job?
B:	And then I have my freedom. I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
M:	The only thing I can think of is you being paid for your time.
B:	Well, it is to me. Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,
M:	I'm just not sure how it would be financially wise to do that.
B:	and I'm just really not interested in all that.
M:	I think it's mostly the first one.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... You know, I'm not sure.
B:	Right.
M:	Yes...
B:	Yeah. Right, and especially if you have a family.
M:	You've got to get some
B:	Then I think it makes a big difference.
M:	I think the group discount is a little more important than that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Do you have to be a parent to have a job?
B:	Right.
M:	I have insurance.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	The work schedule.
B:	Right. Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?
M:	every week
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah. I'm really enjoyed it
B:	Yeah.
M:	you're... flexible?
B:	Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
M:	I mean, it's just an example.
B:	I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who I am so,
M:	I don't really care about my retirement, I'm just here for the money.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, well, I just feel better about myself today.
B:	Right.
M:	Ummow
