M:	you can call me
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know what's up.
B:	Right.
M:	well uhuh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They're all back together now.
B:	Well, it might be a good time for you to to, to start a tradition.
M:	I'm not sure
B:	You could be responsible for that yourself.
M:	The only time I've ever been to the place was when I was in high school
B:	Sure.
M:	Well, that's not true.
B:	Well, in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual  uh, reunion.
M:	He shrugs. I've been around for a long time.
B:	The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.
M:	What about the Jordan?
B:	And all of the descendants of the Civil War, I mean, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together, and they come as far away from California, and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
M:	Well, they are.
B:	Uh, there's a big community hall in Vernon Texas,
M:	What is this?
B:	and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.
M:	That's a little different.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... wait, do you have any relatives in Virginia?
B:	Right, uh-huh. A lot of the older family lives in Vernon.
M:	That sounds cool.
B:	Um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.
M:	Uh, what?
B:	So we're talking about second and third great children here.
M:	I'm not sure if that's how it works.
B:	Uh, I take my boys well, I took them up until this year, they're grown and gone from home now
M:	Why not?
B:	so they, they take their family.
M:	So they, they, their, their
B:	But, uh, let's see, that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather, okay, so it would be the second great grandchild. And so they,
M:	That's what I said.
B:	Well, it's a community center, it's a community hall. It's,  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,
M:	What is this?
B:	and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes. Every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind, and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,  that have been handed,  down for years
M:	So,
B:	Well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.
M:	I'll have you know that I am a vegetarian.
B:	And we choose to bring congealed salad. You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,  as opposed to potato salad.
M:	We have a lot of stuff in the US, so we can have a salad in
B:	And we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,  whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
M:	I don't think you can.
B:	I always, take home baked bread.
M:	Yes, but only for you.
B:	Uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family. I do other things very well,
M:	I know, right?
B:	but there are others in the family who do them better.
M:	I do.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... are you okay?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh... how?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh, the Catholic church is still there.
B:	Uh-huh.  Right.
M:	I.
B:	Well, it's, uh, we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,
M:	
B:	and they plan the reunions, the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer. Uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.
M:	'
B:	We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member, and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. And pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone. And it keeps the family alive,  even, you know, even though it's very fluid.
M:	, and,
B:	And they're very dedicated to that, and, uh, it's been really wonderful. It helps you hang onto your roots.
M:	...
B:	And it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging. My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family. His family was very scattered and very diverse.
M:	I felt.
B:	"And I asked him, I got to talking to him, I said, well, how is his nephew doing. ""Well, I don't know, I haven't,  talked to my brother in three years."" I said , ""Well, how's your brother doing?"" ""I don't know."" Uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, I think, but I don't."
M:	Oh.
B:	"I said, ""Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"" ""Yeah, but I'm, you know, it's too much trouble."" So I got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family. And succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at Lake Tawakoni."
M:	...
B:	Liked to kill me, because I it was, I didn't have that group cooperation, I did,  it by myself.
M:	
B:	And, uh, nobody brought covered dishes. We had a great big fish fry, and, you know, I fixed a salad in a number three tub.
M:	What,, i,?
B:	And, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping. And, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and I told him,
M:	Right.
B:	"We did it that year, and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there. We sent invitations. We said, ""Please let us know if you're coming."" It was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,"
M:	I was,
B:	and it, his mother was alone, and so they came to support her, and then one by one, his you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,
M:	We.
B:	and it was difficult to hold them together. And then, of course, he died two years ago, so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
M:	And,
B:	And, uh, it, I think that's what happens when they get scattered, the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Heh, what?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We had a second reunion
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... and so it wound up.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive. They'll send out news bulletins. Two or three times a year you'll get a news hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature, or guess who our local sheriff,
