M:	How do you think it would work?
B:	Yeah, yeah. I think that it probably would be a, a good program. I think probably two years is too long.
M:	It's not a program, it's a program.
B:	I think maybe a year would be, the longest.
M:	How long would it take to train in the US?
B:	Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
M:	It's the most popular place to go for a long time.
B:	Yeah. So I think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
M:	I.
B:	Yeah. Right.
M:	I think you?
B:	Right. College credit is a good idea because,
M:	I think it's too late.
B:	Right.
M:	College credit.
B:	That's right Yeah, they probably couldn't do anything monetary, but I think, giving, giving some kind of college credit,
M:	Oh, so they're basically giving them money?
B:	No, I don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up and I'm not that familiar with them to know,
M:	You know
B:	But, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
M:	You,
B:	You know,
M:	Because, I think, a lot people, uh, depends on how much money I have
B:	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.
M:	Most people are young, in a way.
B:	So, it's, it's a really tough question. That's right.
M:	I think they have.
B:	Yeah,
M:	Well, the kids in the UK are all working.
B:	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year
M:	Why do you think they are a problem?
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
M:	You mean they have to go to school to get the grades they want to go into.
B:	Yeah. I, you know, I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program,
M:	So... would that make it a good idea?
B:	but I, I think it can't be something that's mandatory.
M:	I think it's fine.
B:	it has to be something that's voluntary. You know, which is pretty much the way it is now. They might,
M:	But you can't make a choice to participate.
B:	Yeah, and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,
M:	
B:	and you've a choice of where you want to go.
M:	I have some?
B:	and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
M:	What??!?
B:	Yeah, in their own community, right. Yeah, that's true Most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
M:	You.
B:	But, they would have to be supported in some way, and I'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
M:	I think
B:	Right.
M:	Are you serious?
B:	Right, exactly.
M:	I mean, you could just sit around, they don't have to pay you
B:	Yeah, it is tough. It's, and I don't know who's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on implementing it, if they do.
M:	Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but this is a pretty tough one.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.
M:	But... they can.
B:	You know, it be, it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.
M:	I'm sorry, can you read, thanks.
B:	They wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.
M:	I would be surprised if they didn't.
B:	You go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience, get them all in the auditorium,
M:	I've never heard of a group of people doing that.
B:	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
M:	Yes.Yes.And if they dont know, they are just as bad as me.
B:	and, I think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
M:	I think you have the wrong subreddit.
B:	but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
M:	Because they're volunteers.
B:	Yeah, it is. It really is.
M:	I think, that is the problem.
B:	Right.
M:	It's the Carter Administration
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	But... you know... things like that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think I know you.
B:	I don't either That's one,
M:	I never thought I'd be in the minority on this one, but I'm still a big fan of the program.
B:	Yeah, it is a tough question.
M:	But I have heard that there are no programs for it.
B:	Sure, same here.
M:	I have no idea what you mean by that.
B:	you too.
M:	Have a good day!
B:	Bye.
