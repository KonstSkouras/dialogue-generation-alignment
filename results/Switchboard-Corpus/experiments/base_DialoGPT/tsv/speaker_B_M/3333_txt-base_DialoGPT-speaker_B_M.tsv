B:	Oh
M:	You said you can do it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Do you mean like when I get the message?
B:	I think five minutes is the max.
M:	How long is the waiting time?
B:	Oh, I don't know.
M:	But there is a reason why he isnt in the video
B:	Right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
M:	I'm not sure what you mean
B:	Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
M:	You
B:	and,
M:	Well, there's also the whole, uh, shooting.
B:	No, I, not that I'm aware of.
M:	Are you in the school?
B:	I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
M:	I know, right?
B:	so, um,
M:	We do, we have the same problem
B:	Is that right?
M:	we have a principal that has a gun and he shoots people
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
M:	I don't know, but I can tell you that they're all over the place in the ghetto.
B:	I know
M:	It's a bit scary.
B:	I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, and it just continues to get worse.
M:	You know what, I'm not sure about this.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And you know, the police.
B:	Right.
M:	We're still here, we're just waiting for them to be found.
B:	Yeah, that's, I I agree, I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children
M:	Yeah, that's how I read it.
B:	and that may impact it as well.
M:	Uh, you know, we have the technology
B:	Right, right.
M:	It's, uh, the, uh.
B:	Yeah
M:	That, I don't know.
B:	they don't think twice about it. Yeah. Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
M:	They didn't think it was a big deal, they just didn't care.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It was just a theory, but I think it might be something like that.
B:	You're kidding.
M:	I can't.
B:	Himself and her?
M:	He's the one
B:	Oh, wow, I bet.
M:	In fairness, he was probably the first person to ever actually get hit by a car
B:	Oh, I know,
M:	I think you mean the one that was on the news for years.
B:	Well, they were, I was watching some show the other day, and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers
M:	You know, the people are the problem.
B:	and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,
M:	It's the same in Ireland, but the media are too busy talking about it.
B:	Right, and then you get to their life story, Oh, they came from a broken family
M:	Heh
B:	oh this person had mental problems
M:	And you're saying they are from a different country?
B:	oh duh, duh, duh you know,
M:	He's an old man.
B:	Yeah.
M:	right.are you a girl?
B:	Is that right?
M:	It was pretty good.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm sorry, I don't remember.
B:	Uh, I remember seeing that,
M:	The first girl she tried with, she was like 15, and she was pretty hot.
B:	I saw that on Hard Copy
M:	They should do that for The Phantom Menace
B:	Yes.
M:	You sure?
B:	Is that right?
M:	Yeah, my daughter graduated from High School.
B:	I'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something
M:	It's all about the car
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
M:	He was so mad.
B:	I remember seeing that.
M:	He's also a great driver
B:	Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
M:	But he's just a normal guy, not crazy.
B:	Yeah.
M:	The police have been known to do things.
