B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm just going to assume you mean in the city,
B:	I think so too. I'm in Texas
M:	... is it a thing?
B:	and very few people carpool
M:	Uhh, not really.
B:	uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
M:	I've seen people do it, but I don't think it's the same.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	What if you're the
B:	That's right. And people don't want to give it up but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
M:	you.
B:	but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
M:	We don't know.
B:	but
M:	Well I think it's going to be a lot more expensive than the new car.
B:	Well, my other line is ringing
M:	I'm sorry, I'm not sure, I think it's a very good line
B:	but we're going to ignore it
M:	I don't think you know what a spoiler is.
B:	I'm sorry for these beeps,
M:	Beep beep beeps
B:	Oh, close to five minutes, I believe.
M:	the thing, I'm not sure.
B:	And you're in Minneapolis,
M:	I don't understand, are you in the room?
B:	Well, is the pollution really bad up there?
M:	There's a lot of pollution down there
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I know.
B:	Yeah
M:	And there's no pollution.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Yay! Another day of being
B:	Well that's the way it has gotten here.
M:	I think you
B:	We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas
M:	I don't know, I'm from the UK and I've never seen a single thing about it.
B:	but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
M:	I think it would be a good policy.
B:	and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed
M:	No, it's just a bad solution.
B:	and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
M:	I think so
B:	uh, they can't use, like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
M:	I guess they can just build a new one with a few more people.
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
M:	uhhhh. you're not gonna get away with this.
B:	therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
M:	I'm pretty sure the costs of replacing a broken unit is covered by the warranty.
B:	and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
M:	
B:	But,
M:	It's like the Freon
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	uhhhh. yes
B:	Um.
M:	uhhh, yeah, uh, but...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uuh, why?
B:	It's probably happened to millions of people,
M:	Yeah, I know, but I don t know if it has happened to other people.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	It is in fact, the only thing that is not free is the service station.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	u ronan I've got a feeling that it's gonna increase in value.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, you can get it for a dollar, so...
B:	Inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.
M:	You're supposed to inhale it.
B:	Yeah, well, of course in the, uh, I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
M:	m
