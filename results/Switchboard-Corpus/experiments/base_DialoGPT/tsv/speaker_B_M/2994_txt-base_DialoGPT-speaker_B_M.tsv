B:	Yeah. And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
M:	...
B:	You're supposed to what.
M:	I'm not sure about
B:	But what are you supposed to do with them. Oh, okay.
M:	I've got it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think you can recycle paper bags...
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, I mean, they do have paper bags in them.
B:	We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit and then we take them, take them in.
M:	I've never heard of that.
B:	Yeah, we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,
M:	Yeah, we don ', we're not a lot of people, but we're the people we are
B:	so, we generally don't have those to do.
M:	Um, we don't, uh, we have them in the states
B:	You know, they, they charge you, you know, it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.
M:	So, we're like the'do'thing, right?
B:	And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
M:	
B:	they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
M:	But it's still not the same as a recycling center.
B:	That that might be a better way to do it.
M:	You could use a yard sale or something.
B:	And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
M:	They could just put a filter on it.
B:	You know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if I just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off.
M:	It's a bit of a dilemma.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ya....
B:	Oh, yeah that's about the same kind of thing.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Where do you live?
M:	I have a friend who can get me a bag
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	Not really, we are just in a big city. I'm in the suburbs.
B:	Yes.
M:	Are you in the US?
B:	It seems like they would be able to.
M:	Why? Do they have to pay you for the time they put you through the website?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They could, but I don'know if it's possible.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's a thing.It's a thing.
B:	Yeah.
M:	They are not really a company, just a bunch of guys in a small company.Their website is just a website for them.And they make money.
B:	Yeah, that's true .
M:	It's the recycling thing
B:	Um, now I didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.
M:	I'm
B:	Yeah.
M:	I know. But they taste good.
B:	Okay.
M:	It's a nice place to recycle.
B:	Okay.
M:	Well I was just joking.
B:	All right, bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said, where were they
