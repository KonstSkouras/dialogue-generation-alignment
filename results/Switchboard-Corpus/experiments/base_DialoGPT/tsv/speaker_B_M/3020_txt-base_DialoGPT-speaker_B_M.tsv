B:	Morocco.  Really.
M:	Moroccans? Where are you?
B:	No kidding. what, what, did you just decide to go there or,
M:	I've been to Morocco.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a friend that goes to Africa for vacation.
B:	Yeah. Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.
M:	And we're all French, so we
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh I'm sorry, I'm not sure.
B:	Was it hot?
M:	I think so.We stayed for a few hours.But I was busy.
B:	Really?
M:	I was in a van
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I was born in Saudi Arabia and, uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around you know, in, in Europe and whatnot,
M:	What happened?
B:	but I was very young so I don't remember that and, I was three when we moved back here.
M:	I don't know, but I'm pretty sure they were.
B:	So I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
M:	I'm
B:	and that I was when I was a baby but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	There were some kids there, where were you?
B:	Really.
M:	They had nothing stolen from us
B:	We, we found that in Jamaica. It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that
M:	I don't think we've found that
B:	but they, they were so destitute and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,
M:	I think the point of this is that it makes people think it's a good idea to buy drugs.
B:	you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
M:	I'm sorry, I'm
B:	Uh-huh.
