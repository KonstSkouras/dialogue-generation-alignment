B:	Oh, uh-huh, yeah, and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be.
M:	Ah, yeah, I'm gonna try it. I don't know what I'm doing right now, but...
B:	Right, and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents.
M:	I'm not saying there's not, uh, there's a lot of people
B:	Right. So, uh, but I, I feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting.
M:	I don't think so.Right.It.Is.N
B:	And, it's, it's, they're, and also they're fed up with the system, and they say, well, why should I even vote.
M:	... And, it's, and, and
B:	Right.
M:	Right. So, uh, why do you?
B:	Right. The lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
M:	What do you mean?
B:	Oh, I know it The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful.
M:	We're talking about Texas, not Texas.
B:	So I don't know, I, I, it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go.
M:	Yea. It was a terrible race
B:	Yeah, I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem, and I think it could get worse.
M:	I'm not sure, I've been pretty depressed about the last few years.
B:	You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude, and say, huh, you know, why should we vote, then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things.
M:	I know. I'm just saying.
B:	Uh-huh. Right, uh, yeah, we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull.
M:	So, I mean, you, you
B:	Yes. Uh-huh.
M:	Ku.
B:	Yeah, and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, I believe.
M:	, you, uh, uh
B:	Yeah, Lyndon LaRouche, that's it.
M:	Is that the guy who was in the newsroom of the
B:	And, uh, yeah.
M:	Yes, yea.That's
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Ohh, that guy
B:	Right. If you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together.
M:	I can't. I'm a Democrat.
B:	You know, I like what he says, and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
M:	He's been in power for over a year.
B:	And, uh, I think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?
M:	I don't
B:	That's what I thought.
M:	I mean, the guy was a senator in Louisiana
B:	And, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know. He might do a good job.
M:	He's a good candidate for the job.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	There is a lot of time left.
B:	What we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism
M:	How do I'm going to vote, now.
B:	and, uh, I know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason, you can just go and vote
M:	What do you mean, uh, I know, you can't vote here, you know, no one's going to vote for you!
B:	and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks, the hours are good and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
M:	I know, I'm just saying, you can't have a referendum, but you can have a vote.
B:	And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long.
M:	Yeah, but they'll have time to finish the race.
B:	So, uh, but, uh,
M:	The people I know are from Dallas, Texas, and I'm not from Dallas.
B:	Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line
M:	Well, uh, I'd like to do that.
B:	and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.
M:	I've voted in a few election days, but I'm still not going to vote.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	The first two are easy, but I'm not sure about the third.
B:	Um, yeah, I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party. And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots, but, uh, my mind has gone blank. I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for
M:	
B:	you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on, and, uh, it's, it's interesting.
M:	We do, you,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You, and.
B:	Right. There for a while, that would, that worked. We've, uh, I know I have, um, I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.
M:	I'll,
B:	But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy
M:	Oh, yeah
B:	or, you know, they're both just as bad, and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party, and, um, but yeah. You know, that's not the best way but,
M:	Yes, that's, that, that.
B:	But it gets to the point where, I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.
M:	yes.
B:	Right, or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous.
M:	I don't know what you
B:	I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections.
M:	We have to have a good story to the people of Iceland.
B:	I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know, this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,
M:	Yes. The polls are what we call a joke.
B:	it's just, it's just ridiculous.
M:	You can't tell me what to do.
B:	Uh-huh, it really could, and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead, and they keep dragging it on, and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
M:	He.
B:	Yeah, so, uh,
M:	I think it's funny that they're doing it, because they're the media, not the
B:	They really do. I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more.
M:	The media is pretty much the only thing that can get him elected.
B:	Oh, yes, or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments, but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
M:	Well, you have to admit that they have some freedom of information.
B:	No, they don't.
M:	I am not sure if they care.
B:	Well, I enjoyed talking to you.
M:	You are a good man.
B:	All right.
M:	I guess you're right.
B:	Bye-bye.
