M:	Uhm, and, and you've been?
B:	Exactly, yeah, um,
M:	Oh, uh, I see.
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
M:	I guess it's more fluid than, um, I think.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. How about you?
M:	How are you?
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	I do, boy
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	I do
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
M:	uhhh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhm. Hmm.
B:	Uh-huh. Sure, yeah.
M:	uhuh uh, I'm not a baby, uh, but I'm a baby!
B:	Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
M:	I.
B:	, yeah.
M:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh. Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it and,
M:	I, I have, I, I like it
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah.Yeah.Like.You.Know.The.Fun.You.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Ohh uh huh.
B:	Yeah, there are. Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
M:	Yeah
B:	Uh-huh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
M:	I think of course
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Hmmm. Yeah. You're. I don't, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'll get you off
B:	Exactly.
M:	You mean like a half hour?
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
M:	Oh yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	that's, uh, kinda how it's supposed to be.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. Yeah, yeah.
M:	Uhh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.Yes.
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
M:	I don't have a lot of sugar.
B:	Uh-huh. I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
M:	I know, but I'm not really sure.
B:	Uh-huh, completely. I mean, any kind of meat or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
M:	You can eat meat.
B:	Yeah, it really does.
M:	I mean, it really helps.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
M:	Well, you know, that's not how the world works.
B:	and so. I found that really helps.
M:	I like the way you think
B:	Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
M:	I'm not really sure. I eat fish. I'm not sure if I eat a ton of fish.
B:	Yeah, and I like it.
M:	It's okay.
B:	I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
M:	I can't help it, I eat fish
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	That's not a thing.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I like ketchup.
B:	Okay, yeah, it sounds good.
M:	I think we've covered the subject.
B:	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
M:	I'm just trying to keep you from getting your hopes up
B:	Yeah. Yeah, it is. Well, it's good talking,
M:	I'm not gonna lie, it's been a long time since I've done it.
B:	Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
M:	How did you learn about this?
