B:	I tape it.
M:	I see.
B:	Yeah, I tape it because I don't stay up that late to watch it,
M:	Oh. Well, I haven't seen it.
B:	I tape it. But I understand, uh, that in England, they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent, and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program.
M:	Yeah, but we do.
B:	And, I'm like, I don't believe this.

B:	I think it's great. I love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else, and competition. I'm going oh, great, you know, it's a, it's a great role model for everybody.
M:	So, are you
B:	Oh, yes, I mean, when I had, uh, I was watching it, the, first time I ever saw a microbiologist on there I thought well, it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities. And, uh, there she was terrific, she was really terrific.
M:	
B:	They hold competitions in Los Angeles in, um, Florida and Minneapolis, um, trying to think of, I think it's in four places around the United States. They hold competition and the only requirement is, of course, your skill of passing these tests,
M:	s

B:	There is a woman that, uh, made, well, she called herself a craft person so, I'm not quite sure what she made. And, uh, she made it. I mean there is no, your occupation has nothing to do with it.
M:	This is, what, the, what?
B:	Strictly your skill.
M:	So, uh, I made it.
B:	Huh-uh.
M:	I guess you could say they were a... well, poor person.

M:	Oh wow, what do you think they win?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's up.

B:	I like mysteries. I tape, um, FATHER DOWLING, because that's another mystery,
M:	Ok. So, what's the next question?
B:	and I don't have to concentrate too hard on them.
M:	Uhm... I'm not sure if you're asking me, but I can try.
B:	Um, most of the lawyer programs like, uh, LAW AND ORDER, they're not on the times that I've got, that I've watched because I haven't had T got, T V GUIDE around here in ages.
