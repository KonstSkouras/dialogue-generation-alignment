B:	I mean I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
M:	You have to be a murderer to have a choice.
B:	or,
M:	Uhh, it's not illegal.
B:	Well, for some things.
M:	You're not in a position to make decisions about it, you're a person.
B:	I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood,
M:	I mean, it's not like anyone is going to do something about it.
B:	I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.
M:	You can't say that about a murderer.
B:	And I don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective.
M:	Because he did it.
B:	But, then, you know, I think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them
M:	
B:	and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment.
M:	...
B:	Uh it is to a certain extent
M:	You're
B:	but I think, I don't know because,
M:	I think you've got the wrong impression.
B:	I think in and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and, and the extent of the abuse and, and if another alternative was available.
M:	If they were not in jail, how did they do it?
B:	Well, I think that would be kind of drastic punishment.
M:	
B:	And,
M:	
B:	But, one thing, I think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated.
M:	I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it is.
B:	But, like I said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then I think they should be eliminated from society.
M:	I'm not sure if you are saying that, but it's not that I don't want to be murdered, I'm saying I would rather be rehabilitated.
B:	But,
M:	I agree with you. I'm not saying that they are a danger.
B:	And a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison.
M:	U
B:	Well, I know in North Carolina, we do have capital punishment.
M:	
B:	And I'm I'm from South Carolina.
