M:	I can't say, I'm not sure.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You wanna go?
B:	I haven't done it in quite awhile since I moved down here.
M:	It's been a while huh?
B:	But I used to do it quite a bit.
M:	I've never done it before.
B:	Yeah, yeah
M:	Yeah. He says.
B:	it was real hilly.
M:	You were just standing on the side of the road.
B:	Take a twenty-two and go out.
M:	He is just going to go get a nice pizza
B:	Take a twenty-two and find a creek.
M:	The best part of this video is that it is in the middle of the desert.
B:	I used to go with my brother.
M:	What do you do?
B:	We just lived up there.
M:	Hahaha. I've been in this neighborhood for a few years.
B:	Yeah, it gets kind of, I, we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in get out of the rain.
M:	Well. It was a while ago.
B:	But I don't know much about camping in Texas.
M:	You're not wrong, I've never even heard of that place.
B:	You live in Pennsylvania?
M:	I'm in Texas.
B:	I didn't know they did this.
M:	I think it's a sign of the times that I am a normal person.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's in Texas.
B:	Yeah. I'm down here at T I.
M:	It's not.
B:	I used to be in Ohio, it's some pretty country up there.
M:	Ohio, right?
B:	So,
M:	I'm from Ohio.
B:	Yeah. You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds you know, that have the water piped out
M:	Is that true?
B:	just set it up and get out of, get out of the city for awhile.
M:	I've never been there, I just want to go.
B:	Tell you what, I'm losing you.
M:	I'm sure you can get away
B:	I said I'm losing you, you're getting you're fading out.
M:	I'm fading out
B:	Yeah.
M:	You're fading me out.
B:	So what, you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp?
M:	You're losing out on the good stuff.
B:	Yeah. I know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks,
M:	I think the best part is the
B:	That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.
M:	A bit, I don't fight.
B:	Uh, copperheads mostly,
M:	What kind?
B:	No, they're.
M:	A lot of them are
B:	Yeah. One year they were, they were just everywhere.
M:	They're everywhere.
B:	I don't know what it was, we had a real rainy spring
M:	I'm sorry, what?
B:	and then it was all year, there was just copperheads everywhere.
M:	And then the rain started.
B:	Yeah. Well I lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time.
M:	Oh. Yeah.
B:	If it rained we were stuck back in there. Had a four wheel drive.
M:	So it was ok then?
B:	You just get used to it.
M:	I'm still waiting for them to get out of the hole.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. You're walking
B:	Yeah. This cave that we used to go in was little, it was small it was more it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out.
M:	Yes.A cave?
B:	Yeah. He's about a year and a half younger.
M:	Are you ok?
B:	Yeah. Yeah, it was. Saw a few bears things like that.
M:	I'm pretty sure you can get into the cave
B:	Yeah.
M:	Were you in the bears camp?
B:	Yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
M:	That's what I was thinking. I'm going to have to go and check the woods out.
B:	But, uh,
M:	That's the first time I've ever seen a cat be afraid of me.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	It's because they're afraid of your gun
B:	I don't know if, they don't have them up there do they?
M:	They are on the rise in the area.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. So... Where do they go?
B:	Oh, do they?
M:	I know, but they are there
B:	Yeah, they, down here they, they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them.
M:	I'm in the US, I just thought they were already extinct.
B:	I don't know what it's like now, I haven't been back up there in awhile.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	Well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
M:	Yes, but it's mostly for the camping.
B:	So,
M:	You know, I'm not too sure about this place.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh. Well, you're a girl, so...
B:	Well, I think we're about to run out of our time.
M:	Well, you're the one who made me laugh.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure, I will.
M:	So, I guess I should go to camp now.
B:	You, too.
M:	Hey, thanks for the time.
B:	Bye.
