B:	And my in-laws also have one, and they're almost as close.
M:	My parents have a similar one.The only thing i can think of is that it's a special type of water.
B:	They're in Richardson.
M:	Where do you live?
B:	Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
M:	What do you mean?
B:	also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
M:	Oh, I've never been home schooled.
B:	And we got, uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.
M:	Ah, okay.
B:	And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
M:	It's my sister in law's name.
B:	And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
M:	Uh... um...
B:	and so we use those and there's some, whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game, so, that's part of it.
M:	I just like to play games with my mom.
B:	Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. Uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,
M:	How does one use a computer?
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
M:	Wait, what?
B:	Yeah.
M:	uh, uh, how did you get these?
B:	I'm, uh, my father had a software company,
M:	Oh. That's cool.
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
M:	I wonder what that's like.
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
M:	They have a computer and a radio, and a computer.
B:	But, um, they're kind of old older
M:	Yeah, it's a little bit older.
B:	so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
M:	We have a program for that, we'll just have to see what it is.
B:	Oh. I have one of those. Yeah.
M:	...
B:	Mine's broke at the moment, but
M:	I'm not.
B:	Oh.
M:	I have a. 22 in my living room.
B:	Yeah, I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh, I did some typing for my father when he had the company
M:	Did you learn that?
B:	and so I learned that on there too, that was,
M:	...
B:	I haven't. That's the one that my father, well, I guess I have used it once or twice.
M:	You can't spell, I mean, have you ever been able to spell?
B:	Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.
M:	You've never used it?
B:	He's got on I B M.
M:	I'm guessing he has an I M in his computer.
B:	And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
M:	I know, but it's on the computer in my room.
B:	That's what I've heard.
M:	Nomroads.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I,
B:	Yeah, you had to, memorize it,
M:	Did you know,
B:	and,
M:	No, you had a spellchecker
B:	Oh. Oh, that's neat.
M:	It's the other way around.
B:	Oh, how wonderful.
M:	...
B:	That, I had heard that that was better. That was a better one.
M:	I, uh, you, you mean that?
B:	Yeah. Yeah, I agree
M:	I think it's the most fun, the most interesting, and the least spoiled
B:	Not too much. What kind of, what kind of things do you write?
M:	You?
B:	Oh
M:	Well, I was just a writer.
B:	to her Go talk to Daddy about it. Excuse me.
M:	I have no idea what you're talking about
B:	to her Go on and talk to Daddy about it Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you. But you don't need to drag it down the hall
M:	Yes, but it was in the attic.
B:	Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged
M:	I'm sorry for your loss.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah. It's like he's gonna be back.
B:	Huh.
M:	... she's an artist
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm... schl'er, sch... er... schm, I mean... schoo'er...
B:	Yeah. I'm anxious some day to have one here.
M:	Oh. I am?
B:	I'm, and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.
M:	Oh. Well, yeah.
B:	My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
M:	Well, what is it?
B:	so.
M:	I'm not good at typing.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You can type on the computer?
B:	I've,
M:	I have.
B:	That's right.
M:	She's not going to have any of those.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	Uh, what?
B:	We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.
M:	He smiles and nods.
B:	And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
M:	What?
B:	And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
M:	Oh. She could've just typed it out.
B:	So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
M:	I've been told by others to make a story.
B:	Yes, yes. I agree.
M:	I agree. She can still learn to type.
B:	Yeah.
M:	She shrugs. I've been in a relationship for a while.
