B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
M:	Uhhh, yeah.
B:	I'd, I would agree, with that even more, I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but I'm really offended,  by the thought that I have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.

B:	or, uh,
M:	Or, uh, I don't know.
B:	Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh
M:	Ughololol
B:	it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, in this state.

M:	Where are you?
B:	uh, it use to be use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,
M:	Uhm, what's that?
B:	but it's kind of, uh, all the industry has gone south,
M:	uuhhhh.uh.uh is a verb, uuh.u is a noun.
B:	and, uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area and, uh, uh,  so it's,   Not too bad,
M:	I, uh, uh.now, uh, uuuuuuuuugghhhhhh
B:	it, you know, you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,  uh, small city type problems,
M:	It's, uh, not like we're, uh... a, uh.
B:	but I don't know that there's a real, uh,
M:	Well, that's not good.
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.

B:	Sure.
M:	I think everyone agrees.
B:	Yeah,
M:	that's a pretty common thing.
B:	if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them I think everyone would, I, they'd,  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face,  as they did it.
M:	I don't think so, I'm not sure what the reason is.
B:	Yeah.   Right.
M:	
B:	Right. Right.
M:	
B:	Well, uh, I, uh, yeah, I don't know I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because I guess it's a pretty,  pretty rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted.
M:	I don't think.
B:	Oh, yeah, an injection,
M:	I don't think it's so much a punishment as it is a process of execution.

B:	I think,
M:	there is no way, I think, the US is the only country that have, the ratio of people, to each other.
B:	yeah, there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like, uh, Massachusetts went back,  and reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,
M:	there's more of a difference between this and the death penalty
B:	I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but, uh, it's on the books.
M:	Not sure if you're aware, but the federal prison system is a federal crime.
B:	Right.
