M:	You know what? I'm gonna go and see a movie.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh.Chris?
B:	So, we used to go and listen to them all the time and, my parents still do.
M:	It's a common theme, yeah.
B:	So, I grew up with a lot of his music, and, and what not. Plus my parents are, well, especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and I both, to a lot of it.  So,
M:	He's been in the band for years, he's a big fan.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, Chris Xero
B:	Sure did.
M:	Hehehe, did it again!
B:	Yeah. We all went to high school together and, uh, and we're still in contact with each other.
M:	Wait, so you are a friend of the same person?
B:	We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not so,
M:	What about us?
B:	Oh really?
M:	I went to a high school in Richardson
B:	It is a small world isn't it?
M:	I used to live in the city, so I used it as a place to get around.
B:	Yeah, he's a pretty nice guy.
M:	You know him?
B:	Yeah, well I never I had to work for him and I never would want to work for him. So
M:	He's not the only one
B:	Yeah, he sure is, he just became a grandfather.
M:	He's a good guy. He's a real human being.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Yeah, they just had the baby's christening so,
M:	Uhhh, what about that?
B:	It was really nice so
M:	Yeah, he's really nice.
B:	He's a little boy
M:	I'm confused.
B:	I can't, it, it's a oh gosh, it's like Elijah, or something like that.
M:	I'm not sure what's wrong with it
B:	I keep forgetting, what, what she named him.
M:	What did you do?
B:	His middle name is Chris, or Christopher for for her daddy,
M:	He's the Chris, but his middle name isn't Chris.
B:	but I think it's Elijah
M:	I don't know.
B:	It starts with an E.
M:	Is it a middle name?
B:	I can't remember
M:	I don't know
B:	Yes.
M:	Did you hear the Richardson?
B:	Yeah, we've heard them and, liked, liked it real well, of course
M:	I have heard the song before.
B:	Um, actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.
M:	It's not my favorite, but I'm pretty sure it's my favorite.
B:	I really like those, in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding.
M:	That's the sound of a guitar
B:	Yeah.
M:	Did you have a harp playing in the background?
B:	Which was real nice. I got married, uh, during the Christmas season and we played, uh, old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not, and it was real nice, I liked that a lot.
M:	I like to think I'm the only one.
B:	I liked the sound of the harpsichord.
M:	... That's a good thing.
B:	No, somebody played it
M:	Did someone actually play it?
B:	No, no, no, no, no. Just by itself, just by itself.
M:	I have a different version of the song.
B:	It was real nice.
M:	That's why I said it was nice.
B:	Yeah. It went well, it was a change, you know, from your traditional, normal, you know, stuff, and since it was Christmas time and, and, uh, we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and, you know, stuff like that and so, we did the harpsichord with old-time traditional Christmas carols,
M:	Y
B:	Not, not, you know, the bouncy, you know sing along kind but some of the old, older ones that
M:	I see
B:	some, I don't even, I recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot, but I didn't recognize the name.
M:	I don't
B:	So, it was real nice.
M:	It was
B:	Um.
M:	How do you know this?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	What's wrong?
B:	It does.  It really does and it has such a different sound to it, anyway. It's almost, I don't know the way it vibrates, it's kind of haunting, you know, on, on some of the notes It, it's, I, I like it.
M:	
B:	I don't know how else to explain. But, we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas, they're, uh, called Odessa. It's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and, uh, we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff, too, so we've had a lot of stuff, you know, friends and, and things to do with music that constant, plus my husband's real big into music, too, so. He doesn't play anything, but, he just likes to listen.
M:	.
B:	And my dad and my kids are now well, my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and,
M:	
B:	Yeah, well, my, my oldest is only nine.
M:	'
B:	So he hasn't really gotten into, um, that yet. They have choir that they go to, you know, music class that they go to
M:	He's a
B:	but, um, he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet.
M:	He's a little old to be a band singer
B:	So,
M:	right.
B:	I think that starts in sixth grade.
M:	Well, the band is dead, but the band still plays.
B:	So,
M:	Oh?
B:	but I don't know. He, he's, he, the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his, my brother plays, and, um, I don't, I don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know, it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something, you know.
M:	It's not.
B:	Yeah, just a little bit
M:	I don't think so.
B:	Uh.
M:	I don't, she's, she says, I'm, she...
B:	Really?
M:	She's good.
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's it.
B:	I don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or ...
