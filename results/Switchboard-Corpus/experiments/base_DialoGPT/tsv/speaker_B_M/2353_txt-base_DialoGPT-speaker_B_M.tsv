B:	and I think they're better people because of it,
M:	Yeah, and I think that's the reason why people do it.
B:	they're much more responsible. I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,
M:	I don't know, I don't think I've ever seen a church that gives me the same chance as a child.
B:	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.
M:	uhh, I'm not really sure what you mean.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm just kidding
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um... I did that, um... for the money.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, I don't know how to spell, but I know I've got a degree in it.
B:	Huh.
M:	uhuhuh. Uhuh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You're.
B:	Huh. and rattling in
M:	I'm waiting for them to finish my graduate year, I'm so nervous.
B:	Yes. Yes.
M:	So you have a church?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's weird.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I think so, it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,
M:	I'm a guy
B:	I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
M:	u uuuuuuuu uh
B:	and I think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
M:	Uhuh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	How about that
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	uuh.
B:	Oh, no.
M:	Uh, uh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... Uh, I'm high school.
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	1.
B:	Yes.
M:	I don't I do you don't really, don't, we are you, we, you, and you dont you, just, you're not, you...
B:	It would really, um, and I don't the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend
M:	What do you mean by that?
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
M:	Not really. They're not a bad country.
B:	And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them
M:	Oh yeah, it's just that they are a little too well off to be in the military.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
M:	You know, um, the school is just a bunch of people with a lot of experience and experience.
B:	and like she's washing
M:	I mean, they are, but they're not like a normal person.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	well, they do have the best voice of any student in the history of the school, if that counts.
B:	Well, that's right. A lot of people they flunk out or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying
M:	I know. I have a problem with it. I've seen it happen.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing
M:	Yeah, but they do the same things to other people.
B:	and,
M:	They are also the biggest family in the world
B:	Um.
M:	The'U'is silent.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh... that's weird.
B:	because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like
M:	Why would you say that?
B:	But, you know, our, like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not
M:	You know, we have, uh, uh... the freedom to do, uh
B:	you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
M:	You're allowed to do things?
B:	And so,
M:	Well, it's not that, it is that,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think it be like that.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	You guys are weird.
B:	And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
M:	Well, the last two years have been a... uh,...
B:	Uh-huh. And
M:	Uhhh, uh, I think they're having a great time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhh... How is it?
B:	That's true. paper
M:	today s young people will be short term pleasure oriented
B:	That's really true.
M:	Everything has to have a payoff.
B:	Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um,
M:	I don't even know.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	They do.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not sure what's the point of this post, but I'm
B:	Huh.
M:	They do.
B:	Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my, what I was going to study
M:	I was in middle school and i had no idea. I have no idea what I want to do.
B:	and at least I had some interest in, a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are, they say oh, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer. Why? Because they make a lot of money.
M:	I'm sorry
B:	And they don't have a goal, they don't have a goal, they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
M:	I have a Goal.
B:	They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
M:	Why don't you have a job?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm pretty sure the lawyers would disagree with you
B:	Yes.
M:	Are you serious?
B:	There's just too many people. Uh-huh. That's right. Not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.
M:	Well, I mean, there are a lot of people that are a part of the community.
B:	You know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, um, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.
M:	
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	... uh
B:	That's kind of sad. Well, anyway.
M:	Lawyer and doctor make the least money in my country.And.they don't.
B:	Well, I guess I better go.
M:	Uh huh.
B:	Well, good luck to you. I enjoyed it.
M:	He smiles back I know. I just think it's funny how it seems like he has no problem with it.
B:	Thanks. Bye-bye.
