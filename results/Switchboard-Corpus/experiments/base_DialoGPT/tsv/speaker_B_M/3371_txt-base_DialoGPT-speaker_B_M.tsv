B:	How many square feet do you have?
M:	, all,
B:	Four bedrooms?
M:	There's a lot of houses in the neighborhood
B:	Five bedrooms. Uh-huh.
M:	5 bedrooms?
B:	I made a, I made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a, uh, what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,
M:	That's what I said.
B:	when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house
M:	When, when
B:	so that,
M:	i, uh, I, uh... I made the fourth bedroom
B:	How many stories? Just one?
M:	We're not too worried about that.
B:	How are they built?
M:	The whole house.
B:	Yeah. I've heard that, I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs.
M:	They are the only ones that have been built.
B:	But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?
M:	Not in the sense that you're gonna have to get a whole bunch of stuff.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You mean the construction on Fox amp Jacobs?
B:	No cracked slab or anything like that?
M:	I have the same problem, and i just can't get the game to run.
B:	All right.
M:	Not at all.
B:	And is it, um, a natural gas and,
M:	The question is, how?
B:	You know what I miss though? Basements.
M:	He shrugs. I've been lucky.
B:	I I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.
M:	It's a shame they didn't have any.
B:	So you,
M:	I have, I'm just saying that's what I've seen a lot.
B:	Can you stand up in it?
M:	My mom has a house in my house. I don't know if I could stand in it.
B:	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
M:	I don't know, it's probably a lot louder than it sounds.
B:	ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.
M:	My attic is a lot smaller than my house.
B:	So, five bedrooms and two living, two family
M:	We do, but we don't have a roof.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You'll be fine.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uhhhhh. What's the difference between the two?
B:	Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.
M:	The only thing I can think of is the
B:	You
M:	You are correct.
B:	Right. Some people, I mean, families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.
M:	Some people, we call it a family.
B:	I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.
M:	We arent even going to get to that.
B:	Strange.
M:	Well, we do have a house.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You are now breathing manually.
B:	Right, right. Uh-huh.
M:	I'm not going to tell you how to feel.
B:	So you've been fairly happy with it. How long have you been in it?
M:	I don't know.
B:	Wow. Boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time
M:	How long have we been in this area?
B:	We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.
M:	You've been in the neighborhood for eighteen years?
B:	And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.
M:	What about the tower?
B:	Yours is a slab I assume.
M:	Well, it's a slab.
B:	Yeah, ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have done if it was slab.
M:	Is it slab?
B:	I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
M:	Do you have any experience with slab building?
B:	But that's because it's so old.
M:	My house is slab.
B:	It's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build like that, and, uh,
M:	That's pretty cool.
B:	I know, he's not a handy, right?
M:	That's not how that works
B:	I, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it
M:	I have a lot of problems with it.
B:	and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
M:	Well, that's why you get good at making a joke, isn't it?
B:	Right. My Dad is actually, uh,
