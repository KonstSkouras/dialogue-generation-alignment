A:	uh yes that's out near the airport. that's about forty-five miles from us.
M:	that's... a lot of drive
A:	it's yeah that's why we not sure we we're not sure we want to uh buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um *listen--one utt? minneapolis-saint paul is very clean
M:	yeah yeah ya er that's
A:	you know in terms of *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
M:	you have you
A:	it really is i mean we're we're in a leased town home and it's uh you're probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month.
M:	.
A:	but you know what if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know the big apartment complexes
M:	what's your apartment?
A:	and and i just have no tolerance for that.
M:	you're right it's probably your teeth.
A:	no.
M:	and you
A:	yeah this is it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh.
M:	are you saying that the people in that area think they're living in the ghetto?
A:	and it's nice but it's i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she can't sell it. and our neighbors
M:	the neighborhood?
A:	yeah i mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank god
M:	and that's why we're in the market for houses huh?
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
M:	you should have bought it
A:	that's how bad it i know.
M:	how bad is it?
A:	that's right. uh-huh yeah. i have some friends that live in westport and it's really really bad. i mean you
M:	that is a real place.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yes but it's a lot of houses
A:	how far where is clarion county in relation to actually because we're considering moving to pennsylvania
M:	uh what?
A:	that's not too bad. that's north.
M:	i'm in the middle of pennsylvania.
A:	are you going up toward uh uh i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an m bradford no that's too far north.
M:	it's a small town in central pa.
A:	so you're you're not that far north then okay.
M:	i live in bradford.
A:	well you're really not too bad. yeah.
M:	i'm not too good with names
A:	um was it a home that you've had for quite a few years or that you've
M:	um yes.
A:	oh then you have yeah. do you have a lot of land or
M:	i have a house so i can live in it.
A:	oh my well then.
M:	i don't think it's the same i've been in it since i was six.
A:	there you go. did you have a hard time getting used to do you feel like you live in an isolated area or
M:	i uh don't know.
A:	yeah i think that that's um i can remember in pittsburgh when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but i can remember when upper saint clair was out in the you know the rural end of washington
M:	upper saint clare
A:	and now it's it's a terrible connection.
M:	it's not a connection. it's a city
A:	oh well that's okay um
M:	i'm not from the area i'm from pittsburgh i don't have a clue about the internet but i'm not going to
A:	but but yeah substantially you know. um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
M:	i know.and we live in an old house.but i'm in a house with a nice clean quiet place.
A:	how big is it? how many square feet do you have?
M:	i'm down i've been looking for a place to live for a while now.
A:	well how many rooms do you think yeah?
M:	uhh no. i'm not.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i guess you're right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we're all in a bath.
A:	a junk room yeah i understand we have that too. that's that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
M:	i think we have one room but that's all
A:	that's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
M:	that is huge
A:	uh-huh.
M:	this is a big problem.
A:	it's enough space for two people yeah.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	oh okay.
M:	i was joking.
A:	yeah right. that's okay. well we've got um this town house is pretty big. it's about eighteen hundred square feet. it's got three bedrooms two and a half baths
M:	well they're not out on the street.
A:	um it's really nice.
M:	well i don't know.
A:	yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	that's a great deal.
A:	um but it's just again the the privacy you know. um we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near
M:	well the owner is a lawyer.
A:	right near dayton ohio and he said you know he's he's slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
M:	... where do you live?
A:	right.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you can't have your own land.
A:	that's kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of atlanta and in georgia
M:	he's a big guy he's got a big gun he can do whatever he wants.
A:	and it is too far south for me
M:	uhh what about it?
A:	but um um but i mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin i just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these. i mean it's just beautiful. it's like a custom you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins. you know i mean it's modern it's
M:	lolglad.
A:	right right it's modern it's beautiful it's country
M:	a lot of all of modern all of course
A:	it's you know um but uh i don't what else about housing except it's uh well pittsburgh's housing economy i think it's holding it's own.
M:	it's is uh is
A:	what part what sections are they in? yeah that's nice.
M:	i think they're in the mountains but i could be
A:	great.
M:	... and?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	which one?
A:	uh-huh. that's yeah a really good friend of mine lives in penn hills and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now
M:	i'm sorry but i'm not sure what you mean by that.
A:	and um it's it's you know they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
M:	uhh i think you might have the wrong person here.
A:	um but it's a beautiful home and i mean my brother lives
M:	uuhhh yes?
A:	is it called baldwin or bebble?
M:	it's like beautiful.
A:	i mean he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon um it's real pretty up there. it's just
M:	oh that's a pretty cool place.
A:	and the neighborhoods are stable you know.
M:	that's why they call it the north.
A:	it's uh when you come to this part of the country we've been away from dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
M:	wait what?
A:	oh my goodness.
M:	this is how i felt when i was married to a guy from texas.
A:	uh-huh. that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in yeah
M:	...
A:	that's kind of like where we're
M:	and we have to move out of
A:	so we're considering pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know.
M:	where are we
A:	a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i.
M:	i do i think it's weird how many people say they don't live in a place that matters.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well if you're a native american you should probably be.
A:	i know and it and the economy here in dallas i mean it it's steady but it's still not going up.
M:	it's because of the economy not the people.
A:	and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years uh you you know.
M:	uhhh i uh i don't know.
A:	oh i'm sure yeah there i mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives
M:	i'm it i'm you that's i
A:	um it's really i mean and and it's hard to sell the properties. people from j c penney's from new york came here about a couple of years ago.
M:	i and right.
A:	and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property and it would make you ill to see this.
M:	i'll yuh money
A:	i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in pittsburgh or something.
M:	the
A:	yeah i know and that's you know like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
M:	it's like you can see the future.
A:	you know it's across the way and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas
M:	hey you know you can look at the other side of the wall and it'll look right back at you
A:	but it's still it's still not that private.
M:	it's still it's not that bad
A:	yeah but you have a rider.
M:	there's no such thing as a bad time for me.
A:	no and your kids have to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead
