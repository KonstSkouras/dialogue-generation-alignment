M:	i don't, but i do like spaghetti
A:	uh, got kids?
M:	i'm a spaghetti person.
A:	married?
M:	i'm so down for this.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, uh, what about my husband?
A:	well, my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet.
M:	well, you know what to do, huh?
A:	uh,
M:	do you want to cook?
A:	uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
M:	i'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about.
A:	let's see, a good dinner party menu.
M:	i don't know.
A:	i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, i guess.
M:	i'm not sure, maybe.
A:	you know, uh, something light and easy. if it was pretty informal about anything.
M:	it's a good idea.
A:	breast of chicken oh, gosh, yeah. how do you usually cook your deer?
M:	oh yeah. we're gonna have a deer.
A:	how do you usually cook your deer?
M:	weird...
A:	yeah.
M:	i don't think we can be sure.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, you can have a steak and a beer.
A:	i imagine.
M:	it's been good
A:	i would imagine it is.
M:	is it good?
A:	yeah. yeah, i understand. we just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	uh, some veggies in it.
M:	i like the way you think.
A:	no.
M:	was the deer a vegetable?
A:	no, the times i've been out deer hunting, i, i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
M:	you don't hunt deer.
A:	i mean, i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. so, no, this was given to us by some friends.
M:	it's in the description.
A:	uh, guy was in a, uh, in a hunting club
M:	how did you get in there?
A:	and, you know, but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day, they split it
M:	they don't go out hunting.
A:	and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group.
M:	you know, uh...
A:	well, he they, they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit
M:	didn't they go out last time?
A:	so there's, everybody had deer coming out their ears. so,
M:	they were just trying to get the deer to go into the city.
A:	yeah, they, they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they, about eight months ago they gave it to us.
M:	so did they give us some of that deer?
A:	we, we either crock pot deer or we'll, uh, you know, put it out on the grill so that, uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
M:	oh, well, they're delicious.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	uhh, yeah.
A:	that is good.
M:	i'll be sure to.
A:	deer spaghetti is real good.
M:	heh, heh.
A:	anyway, uh, no, i think if i was going to have a dinner party, i'd probably have, uh, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, uh, uh, you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, or maybe have something roasting out on the fire.
M:	i know, it's just... i don't know, i don't really know.
A:	oh, well, anyway. uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
M:	what? uh, uh, i'm not really interested in that.
A:	usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
M:	what's the meal?
A:	let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over. ah, yeah, we had a, uh, a turkey loaf.
M:	i have a turkey sandwich
A:	which, uh, kind of taco turkey loaf. it was good. uh, scalloped potatoes.
M:	well, i mean, you're not wrong.
A:	no, mashed potatoes.
M:	what's a potato?
A:	mashed potatoes with, uh, cheese melted over the top of them. a couple things like that. it was pretty good little dinner. yeah, usually it's
M:	what did you eat?
A:	oh, don't you hate that? i've got a, i got a few pounds to lose myself. that's okay.
M:	i've got to say, that's a really good idea. i've been thinking about it, but i don't think it'll work out.
A:	i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old.
M:	you're a little late.
A:	yeah, yeah, i was, left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,
