M:	you?
A:	and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good.
M:	i love running, i love exercise, i'm a runner, i just like running.
A:	got out a lot of aggression. i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, i felt really good. i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. now when i do those things, they're boring. i would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
M:	nope.
A:	and so i just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it and i'm just feeling really good. i love the class, it's real challenging, so i'm really into that, i really like that a lot.
M:	congrats.
A:	it is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
M:	that's
A:	it's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. and it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
M:	what is
A:	and i'm, i'm getting much better. my stamina is getting great for the dance floor  so  i mean it's just,
M:	that's what i mean.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
M:	it's a good game.i like it.it's fun.it's not a chore to play.
A:	it is inside and i've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
M:	i don't know what's inside, but i like it.
A:	and i just enjoy that much more too than inside.
M:	that's a good idea. i'll take it.
A:	i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework.
M:	what are you doing for a week?
A:	so i've enjoyed that part of it. yeah. and at the gym, even in the class, uh, i, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. everybody's on their way to someplace
M:	i'm
A:	and so, you know, i do  have one friend who goes occasionally
M:	it's not.
A:	but, basically, i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty  so.
M:	yeah, it's a bit of a problem, but i'm not going to be alone in the gym
A:	there are, there are.  it's more motivating that way, i think. yeah.
M:	oh, you know.
A:	you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v but you probably wouldn't.
M:	i could probably get a tv in the middle of a city.
A:	so.
M:	yes.yes.but.if you have a tape and can't do it.
A:	yeah.
M:	you could also use a tape recorder, maybe.
A:	yeah,  yeah, i can see it'll be a good break.
M:	yeah, yeah
A:	right.
M:	he said it
A:	uh-huh
M:	you're welcome.
A:	i think you do. you feel very good after you exercise.  i think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
M:	i feel like i can go back to sleep.
A:	you owe it to yourself
M:	i don't know, i just do.
A:	and i think you do accomplish more after that.
M:	i think so.you do.you feel very happy.you are.full of.yourself.for.the.full.time.you are.alone.you have a nice.life.you deserve.it.you owe.it to.it.
A:	and i think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, i think it's well worth it. i just demand that time for myself. now i've learned to do that
M:	i think it is.
A:	and, you know, and it's, i think it just benefits you all around. so.
M:	yes, i think i do.
A:	you have to. because   there's always more things to do.
M:	what is that?
A:	there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just, i don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, i just feel entitled to it
M:	well, i think there's more to it.
A:	and i take it  so.
M:	you dont have to
A:	no, i've done some walking with friends in the past.
M:	have you?
A:	but i find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
M:	i do a lot of walking.
A:	and that's not really beneficial, so, uh i don't have time like that
M:	i'm not too sure.
A:	and i spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
