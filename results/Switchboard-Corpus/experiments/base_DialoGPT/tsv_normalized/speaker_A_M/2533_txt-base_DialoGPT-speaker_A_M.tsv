M:	i'll take the astros.
A:	really? i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but, um, i understand a little bit about the texas rangers. i know george bush threw out the first pitch hitter bounced off the ground and that, um, yeah , i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that, in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system, and, uh, the radio's kind of cruel, i mean, think, the, he, this chain that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground, i mean, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man. i don't care if you're president.
M:	
A:	i know but he's a man come on, men know how to do that, right?
M:	you
A:	i know so, i felt kind of sorry for him. that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but, um, i never , a major owner of our of the team here.
M:	
A:	yeah, he's like, i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is, if, you know, about neal bush i think is his name.
M:	neil.
A:	see, i even know his name because he's on the news a lot, and i never had to watch the news not, you know, not like some people hour and a half a day or anything.
M:	i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you're
A:	oh, i saw that.
M:	that's.the.about.about.
A:	yeah.
M:	no, i'm pretty sure you're right.
A:	i want to see your driver's i, i, i don't,
M:	it's a photo of a car, so it's not fake.
A:	you're not president bush. i know and he said yeah, it does so fast , i heard it on the radio. i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didn't see it but,
M:	no it doesn't.
A:	that's about my extent of, um, about baseball, i don't know, that much about it.
M:	i don't
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, it's only been a day.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what's the significance of the mets opening?
A:	did they?
M:	they did.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	they won.
A:	that's so stupid that you all have two teams.
M:	new york yankees.
A:	that's really stupid.
M:	i'm not even a fan of the new york mets.
A:	yeah, i know.
M:	it's not like they play each other every year.
A:	yeah.
M:	so the yankees are the new england patriots?
A:	the texas rangers, they, they lost, i think.
M:	who's the team?
A:	but i know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year. we got free tickets because someone at our church, one of the deacons at church, um, parks cars at the mansion at turtle creek which is like one of the, uh, the places and stuff.
M:	you are right, but they have been in the past.
A:	and he's their head chauffeur, is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.
M:	he's the driver of the car.
A:	yeah, he makes good money too doing that, you'd be i was shocked, but anyway, someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year,
M:	i
A:	and then the iranian couldn't, he didn't want them, so he gave them to alan, and alan and his dad had plans that night so they gave them to us, so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian, with baseball tickets,
M:	ah, i see.
A:	and we ended up with them, right. and so we were, walking up
M:	there was a moment where we all agreed to tip each other.
A:	and i looked at my husband and i said, you know what kyle this is the mansion at turtle creek a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,
M:	weirdly enough,
A:	oh, yeah, we they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats, you know because,
M:	yeah, it was.
A:	yeah, and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up you know, i just was there, you know, like i'm loaded, i'm here, you know, and, uh, it was just kind of funny because, you know, but we got to sit by first base if they did hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in, you know.
M:	...
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	
A:	really?
M:	i, i think,
A:	i'm glad my husband's not like that.
M:	your wife is on a diet.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, my mom has a crush on me
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm so
A:	that's funny.
M:	it's still, uhuhhuh?
A:	you miss the whole thing.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	that's funny. where is he from in france? uh-huh.
M:	
A:	yeah. i have a, i had a friend in college from strasbourg,
M:	yeah, but you're from france.
A:	uh-huh. paris. and my cousin lives in paris and she's lived there for like, oh, off and on for twenty years.
M:	i don't know if you know this but the last time i lived in paris was in'96.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	hahaha, i was talking about strasbourg, but yeah.
A:	saint claude is that sound familiar?
M:	he was a saint claude
A:	yeah.
M:	yeah, saint.claude
A:	oh, really?
M:	it's a nice place to live.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's the, uh, limit.
A:	that's neat. yeah, she married and they have twelve children.
M:	... and she's like, i know.
A:	she has twelve children.
M:	she looks like a great mom.
A:	she looks gorgeous, no she's gorgeous and she just liked having kids and she's thin and, i mean, four or more children are thin,
M:	why is she so thin?
A:	i mean, i'm not kidding you.
M:	it's a joke.
A:	no, your, i have a friend now that has seven. and, um, and they're all eight and under, and nine and under,
M:	and, uh, are you a six year old?
A:	they're all real young, they're just raised right that's what god's told them to do but they're not condemning you, if you, we only have one child, you know, they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, i'm sure, for them to do that, you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it. and so i'm real proud of them because they're aren't really, they don't do that at all.
M:	i
A:	you go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there. and i always give her a hard time whose toothbrush did you really use this morning
M:	
A:	uh-huh. they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole we don't honor god with this portion and so they, i think that helps a lot. i think that's the key, in he, like his sales last year he just works a normal job. he probably has an income of thirty-five thousand, but last year he made that got him a bonus of twenty-five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van. he loves god, i mean, it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,
M:	
A:	and he got to do it and so god just really blesses him in ways like that, do trust god because, i don't know, kids are a blessing and, and some people you know, we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that, but kids are just as much of a blessing inside these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think, oh, well, i'm not blessed i have an old car. but you've got five kids, you know,
M:	
A:	you're just as blessed, probably more, because if you follow this, there's a good book called what the bible has to say about child training, by richard fugate
M:	
A:	and he's, you know, a lot of wisdom in it. and the kids at bible talk about anything but training, and training is different than anything else in, in psychology doesn't address it. a lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it, but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the bible and so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.
M:	they
A:	what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so, you know, they do that and they, they just live lean pretty much they don't, she doesn't shop at foley's you know, and stuff like that. but a lot women die or shop at foley's so things ,
M:	
A:	it's like a macy's, kind of store,
M:	...
A:	it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and, you know, you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did. you know what i mean?
M:	i love
A:	you do these fun things, you know, in other kinds of ways and i know manhattan's real expensive but, um, it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment, right?
M:	i do this, but i'm in manhattan.
A:	yeah.
M:	oh, i see.
A:	well, church softball leagues, so,
M:	i'm a little confused, what are you talking about?
A:	they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls' league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one and i just haven't gotten around to doing it. i keep saying we need to have one. they go, okay, then start one. but everybody wants to do it but, you know, god's sitting on my heart and i just hadn't gotten around to doing it, but anyway, so they could really only have four members on the team. i think they only have four boys . i don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
M:	
A:	but, um, then you didn't believe me about her kids *listen: this and utt2 as one utt are the they are so good. i'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and, that, that's what they're called to do.
M:	
A:	i have a, most of my friends,
M:	i'ed you
A:	i know, i do too, i, most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like, you know, that's really why god and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't, i had my tubes tied so you,
