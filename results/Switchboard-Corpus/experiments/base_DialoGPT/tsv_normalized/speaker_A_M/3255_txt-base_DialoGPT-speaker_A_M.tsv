M:	that, um, uh, uh?
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, i think the majority of the people do not carpool.
M:	i think,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	no, it's not.
A:	yeah.
M:	do you mean carpool?
A:	exactly.
M:	because people don't know.
A:	uh-huh, or if somebody gets sick. yeah, or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,
M:	i think it's the other way around.
A:	you're definitely right,
M:	well if they're not going to be there for a while, they're probably not going home.
A:	uh-huh. sure. sure, that happens quite a bit,
M:	uhh
A:	yes, yeah
M:	you think that's bad?
A:	that's very true. uh, other than that, uh, i don't know,
M:	it's just a very small thing.
A:	okay.
M:	no, i'm the only one that is, sorry
A:	oh, okay, we'll try to be real quick here.
M:	i'm sorry, i was talking to the guy in the other line
A:	the other thing then is, because i don't know how long they want us to talk,
M:	oh, i didn't say that.
A:	five minutes, oh, okay.
M:	there's not much time left.
A:	minneapolis area,
M:	what's the other thing?
A:	uh, actually no. we have, uh, quite a bit, uh, the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
M:	what is your problem?
A:	you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural
M:	what are we, a country?
A:	um, but there is starting to, in minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,
M:	
A:	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
M:	h
A:	at least where you .
M:	i don't think i'm gonna be able to drive home for the rest of the night.
A:	sure, yeah,
M:	you're saying you'd be ok with that?
A:	yeah, it's not a bad idea. uh-huh. sure, sure,
M:	that's a pretty good idea, i think i might do it.
A:	exactly,
M:	well, the car was designed for air pollution so, no, it's probably not a good design.
A:	uh-huh. sure. uh-huh.
M:	yeah, and they are making the stuff in the air.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i can't even.
A:	sure.
M:	uhh, they can just use a certain type that they have a lot of money to buy.
A:	uh-huh. sure.
M:	you can get a free unit of freons for a dollar.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. sure
M:	and, uh, if you
A:	uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, i'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
M:	uhh, no, it's not.
A:	but it's uncomfortable
M:	uhhuhuhuh. i don't know.
A:	but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
M:	i'm pretty sure that's the case.
A:	and, i don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
M:	it's okay.
A:	and i was thinking how many other people
M:	uhh, how many people have you had to work with?
A:	oh, sure, because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
M:	it was the first thing i thought of.
A:	so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, hey, that's that's right there.
M:	so i have that feeling that the freon price will increase...
A:	i think it's like three or four dollars a, a can
M:	i'll have to check when i get home, but i think it'll be around three or five dollars.
A:	and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car, and i, i thought about that, and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
M:	that's the joke.
A:	but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that
M:	but it's not an airplane, it's a fuel tanker.
A:	exactly.
