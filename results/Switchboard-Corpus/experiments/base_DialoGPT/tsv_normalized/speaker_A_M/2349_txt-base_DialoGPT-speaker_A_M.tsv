A:	yes all all young americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means.
M:	they said they were from the south
A:	yeah.
M:	you mean it would be?
A:	yeah. yeah you're probably right two years might be a little too long.
M:	it's probably not a bad idea.
A:	that's right. that that would be the problem. sure would.
M:	if you don't want to be in the military you don't have to serve anyone.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it. uh you know college credit you know something you know
M:	you.
A:	i'm not sure what but
M:	i think it's a good idea
A:	i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind.
M:	they should get their own college credit.
A:	but that that kind of takes away from public service.
M:	i'd say the same thing about a super salary.
A:	but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know. i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
M:	i
A:	i'm not either really.
M:	you know that.
A:	that's right.
M:	
A:	that's right.
M:	i know
A:	uh-huh. that's right. absolutely. they need young families whatever
M:	and then there's the kids who are born to be teenagers.
A:	they just couldn't you know take off to do that.
M:	you could say they were... so far.
A:	oh
M:	it's a question.
A:	that's right uh-huh.
M:	they're both the same right?
A:	uh-huh it sure would. it would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think.
M:	you're thinking of the most popular not the most common.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it would be interesting to see how many people would go.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	i uh know.
A:	that's right. i'm not even really sure at this point in time you know what what programs are out there.
M:	i think the only way to fix it is to have it run the program and then not fix it.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	this is not an answer
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm gonna.go
A:	yeah like maybe if if there was something they could do in their own own in their own town or city yeah and not have to pull up roots and you know go somewhere half way around the world or something.
M:	like if they went to a different country.
A:	that's right. yeah that's that's true too. that's true too.
M:	i think they're all right.
A:	yeah yeah. me neither. and you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know just sit around for their year
M:	yeah?
A:	or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind.
M:	i mean you can do that anyway.
A:	yeah it's tough. it's tough.
M:	i'm not sure if it's hard or not.
A:	yeah. yeah. i i'm not sure either. but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know.
M:	i think they will.
A:	yeah.
M:	i don't think they can be a'school '
A:	yeah.
M:	yes.yeah. it's it's.
A:	yeah. that's right.
M:	it isnt.but if they had to spend a lot more money on advertising it wouldnt be a lot but it would be.
A:	yeah.
M:	i guess.yeah.its a little hard to explain.they are like a small group of people.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i have a lot of stuff to do.
A:	right.
M:	i think you mean like you have to be a volunteer for the school not a community member
A:	that's right. yeah. that's a real waste too. it really is.
M:	i think they're volunteering for community
A:	i don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the carter administration
M:	they have a lot of things that we don't.
A:	that was that was a big thing with him.
M:	what? that's not a thing.
A:	and i guess even back to kennedy as a matter of fact i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was you know really interested in things like that.
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	i just don't hear much about it anymore. like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know.
M:	there's a lot of people who are still alive who don't know about it.
A:	anyway it's a tough question.
M:	well i don t know.
A:	okay well thanks for your time. i enjoyed talking to you.
M:	well it's not my fault i have a lot of people to work with.
A:	okay take care.
M:	you too.
A:	bye-bye.
M:	ok bye.
