M:	wait, how did you get him to sign with the giants?
A:	so, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
M:	he's not that young.
A:	right now, both of us are students.
M:	what's your age?
A:	uh, uh, university of southern mississippi.
M:	what's your school?
A:	uh, she's,
M:	no, she's not.
A:	yeah.
M:	you know?
A:	uh, probably. uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
M:	well, uh, that's uh, uh... uh, well, uh uh, we'll see what happens.
A:	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
M:	i don't think you understand.
A:	it will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
M:	... and a week?
A:	so depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. uh, i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
M:	
A:	so for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
M:	just...
A:	uh-huh
M:	you, the...
A:	yeah.
M:	oh. uh huh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you could have done the same.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well, uh, you're a bunch of uh, uh...
A:	yeah.
M:	um, uh, they've been in the country.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, they're kinda...
A:	yeah.
M:	it's cool.
A:	uh, that makes a big difference.
M:	oh, i don't know about that.
A:	yes.
M:	you think it is good?
A:	yeah.
M:	so... you think that's good?
A:	there's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
M:	how do you know this?
A:	and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their home ec department
M:	i was the one who made the, uh, first mistake.
A:	uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, american family counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. but, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	so,
M:	i'm not the only one who thinks this, uh, is it just me or is it
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know what you're talking about.
A:	yeah.
M:	oh, cool.
A:	yeah. yeah,
M:	i'm sure it's just a matter of time
A:	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,  because if you over,
M:	yeah. i think it's really 
A:	uh-huh. yeah. yeah.
M:	i don't think it's a real life thing, but i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	
A:	yes. and it's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do.
M:	you.
