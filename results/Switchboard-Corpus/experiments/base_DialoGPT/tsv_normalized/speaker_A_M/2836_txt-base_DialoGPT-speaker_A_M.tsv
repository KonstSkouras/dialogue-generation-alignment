M:	i
A:	what, uh, is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
M:	
A:	uh-huh. do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?
M:	
A:	how far out from the city, i mean, do you,
M:	you, what, you, do.
A:	about fifteen miles. i live in a little suburb, uh, which is, i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
M:	what city?
A:	but it's pretty congested. we are considered in the country,
M:	aye, i'm in the us.
A:	but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
M:	it's not that bad, you just have to get used to it.
A:	our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.
M:	what is your major crime?
A:	however, i'm sure they're there.
M:	the only thing i can think of is that there are no guns in the area.
A:	but, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.
M:	hm, yeah.
A:	and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.
M:	they have that now?
A:	it's cut back, you know, considerably, but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood, so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
M:	that's, yay, y'all
A:	uh, i would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
M:	i'm
A:	most,
M:	most of it?
A:	well, most families, most families are young and both people are working.
M:	i thought it was because the majority is young, not old.
A:	so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
M:	they are happening
A:	uh, so, uh, i would say that's probably their prime motivation. they'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.
M:	well, i would have to get the right sort of person to do it.
A:	uh, they classify most of them as professionals.
M:	what are the people who do the work?
A:	uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
M:	uhh, i don't think you understand.
A:	probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles, the, you know, mercedes, volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
M:	h
A:	guns, that sort of stuff.
M:	what
A:	very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.
M:	what kind of stuff?
A:	well, uh, the police force, for one, i think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use. uh, it's, oh, right now i think, we are about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
M:	what are you talking about?
A:	and,
M:	they're not.
A:	well, the, course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever, so they're giving the early release, uh,
M:	it
A:	yeah, and, and it's, i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh, but for the,
M:	i am i'm so we're not, building prisons.
A:	that would be, certainly be a deterrent.
M:	i'm sure there are many other countries that don't have this problem.
A:	and, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires. you know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. uh,
M:	no, but they can be used for this purpose.
A:	uh, i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases. course, i, i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
M:	... and that's
A:	uh,
M:	i, uh, i can't.
A:	i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, uh, to convict somebody
M:	you would think they would be able to.
A:	and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes, uh, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow-through with that.
M:	they are still a crime, though.
A:	uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder
M:	uh, uh, uh
A:	uh, i know in my case, i, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty-five
M:	i know.
A:	and we caught, the individuals got caught, we, uh, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
M:	did you really?
A:	and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh you know, the, the forty-five to the head, you know, just the, the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh, you know, the guy only got five years.
M:	i was going to say,
A:	and, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system. so what, what,
M:	... i've never seen a dog out in the
A:	do what now?
M:	you know, uh, uh you did, uh uh
A:	no. i'm not real familiar with that.
M:	did he sue you for damages?
A:	oh.
M:	you know, that's a good idea. i don't know how much money i could make from it.
A:	well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job, he has nothing, there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after.
M:	why would you?
A:	yeah. uh, very
M:	he is not a criminal, and he is not guilty of any crime.
A:	yeah. they don't do that here. course they pay them, but they don't, you don't, you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
M:	the us.
A:	and, uh, you know, and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders, they, uh, been in jail before
M:	but he's an ex cop.
A:	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, uh, deal i hate to see.
M:	i hate to say it,
A:	but, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
M:	yeah, i
A:	and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
M:	i think it's yeah. yeah.
A:	and he goes out and commits it again. fact, he's back in jail now. so, what, what, uh,
M:	i think you're thinking of yeah.yeah.that.was.like.a. thing
A:	yeah. what, what deterrent does he really have?
M:	i'm just glad he's not in jail.
A:	yeah, i think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility.
M:	i think in this case it's just more of a deterrent.
A:	uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
M:	uh, we've never had a break in.
A:	and, uh, return offenders have, they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood, they'll rob one house, then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
M:	hahaha. nice.
A:	course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
M:	what if you have a family and family members who would like to go home?
A:	but, uh, nevertheless, i think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
M:	it's not a story the police would tell you.
A:	you can, you know, you can get some of us,
M:	you can't be serious.
A:	you can't get all of us.
M:	we have a lot of them
A:	uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
M:	we're all gonna make it brah
A:	yeah.
M:	it's a good deterrent
A:	yeah, that's, i mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
M:	i think the point is that he has to be careful not to break in.
A:	and, uh, it helps for a while
M:	well, they do have a way to get you to shoot them...
A:	but then just another different set of people come in, and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state.
M:	it's the same person, just different pronouns.
A:	uh, i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in oklahoma, and louisiana, arkansas, you know, across the, the border.
M:	i wonder how many of them are from arkansas
A:	so, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
M:	i think he was joking
A:	it's not many from the local communities.
M:	how many of those are from the towns?
A:	but, uh, it's a problem, and i, i just, i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,
M:	... but... it's not a problem.
A:	would be a definite deterrent and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.
M:	well, the problem is that they don't know what to do with them.
A:	right.
M:	there is that?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i am,
A:	i know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
M:	how did you feel when you saw the news?
A:	they, they went to all, all ...
