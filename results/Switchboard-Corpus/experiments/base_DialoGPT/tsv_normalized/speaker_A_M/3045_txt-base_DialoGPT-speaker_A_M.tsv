M:	they are in a glass jar.
A:	right.
M:	we have a few of those
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh. and what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
M:	i don't have a garage, so i don't really have a car.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm sorry?
A:	oh.
M:	yeah, uh, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	umm. uh huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i've been told by my family that i have an apple.
A:	great. yeah.
M:	she got me a copy of the iphone app for school.
A:	oh, sure.
M:	i think we've got a few of them in the past.
A:	yeah.
M:	do you have a resume?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah, well, i tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.
M:	it's the most beautiful thing ever.
A:	uh,
M:	i dunno.
A:	oh.
M:	i've been told.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but they're still the same.
A:	yeah.
M:	i think it's a little late to make this comment
A:	right.
M:	i don't think that's the case.
A:	yeah, yeah. um, i i'm a, a writer by profession and, uh, when, when i was first here in, in dallas or in plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and i got an i b m selectric. i thought i had died and gone to heaven because i thought, oh, they're so wonderful.
M:	it's
A:	well, then, um,
M:	i'm not really, i'm just...
A:	yeah, ours really needs to have some work done on it but, but then my husband, um, worked at t i and i got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, but he got a, um, uh, the, the t i professional and brought that home and i learned wordstar on that,
M:	it,
A:	and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
M:	i am so glad you were able to
A:	uh-huh.
M:	how did you learn, uh.learn?
A:	yeah. have you ever used, do you use wordperfect ever? have you ever used wordperfect? or,
M:	i've never, ever used it
A:	uh-huh.
M:	have you ever heard of the word, uh.
A:	right.
M:	uhhh. it's a thing
A:	yeah, yeah. that's probably where you've used it.
M:	i've used a few of them.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. um, i have that on my, uh, computer here and also, um, i do some work at u t d and, uh, that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software. and, um, i don't know from my own experience, um, wordperfect is just so much better than, than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have. it may be improved by now but,
M:	
A:	yeah, it's, uh, wordstar was never very intuitive to me. i mean you know, you, some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the computer but, uh,
M:	
A:	i mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.
M:	...,
A:	yeah.
M:	it's like, you know, i can
A:	and, but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways. and you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
M:	i
A:	yeah, and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.
M:	
A:	so, you know, it's just,
M:	
A:	yeah. yeah. and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything, and oh, it was just awful. so, um, i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled. but i think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
M:	
A:	so, um, well, i have not really paid much attention because i clock, although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
M:	i think about?
A:	well, um, i was a technical writer for many years, um,
M:	you.
A:	and my husband and i actually met in a computer company. um, i was a tech writer and he was an engineer. and, uh, so i did tech writing for a number of years.
M:	this is weird.
A:	oh, sure.
M:	um, um, um.
A:	got a problem, huh? um,
M:	hehehe.
A:	oh. trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?
M:	i don't know. i'm just gonna leave it here.
A:	but, um, i have, um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing. and, um, for a while i had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist. so i did some advertising and p r but,
M:	
A:	um, now i'm, actually i'm, i'm not working anymore. i'm a student, i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,
M:	what do you, i do you?
A:	i've done a little, a lot of different kinds, but i, i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great. and, uh, i'm, so i'm real spoiled.
M:	i
A:	yeah.
M:	what's your day
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	heh. i'm... not a bit.
A:	good.
M:	how do you know about that?
A:	that's great.
M:	i know.
A:	yeah.
M:	so?
A:	well, those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
M:	you know, i'm not sure.
A:	so, um, i think that that would be a real, a real, uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, uh, do it early,
M:	she's a little too smart for that.
A:	so. uh, do
M:	i think she's going to have to make a joke about that first, i think
A:	oh, neat.
M:	i know, right?
A:	yes. right. oh, great.
M:	it's ok.
A:	right
M:	but, what about it?
A:	that's great. well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life, so might as well start now, huh?
M:	she's a good boy.
A:	well, nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly. this is really going to be fun i think,
M:	i don't know.
A:	and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the,
