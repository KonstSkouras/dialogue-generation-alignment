M:	so it's the us?
A:	there's uh maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
M:	weird. what's your point?
A:	that
M:	i uh i uh... i don't know.
A:	uh state of minnesota.
M:	where are you from?
A:	so there's the potential that perhaps you know the u s budget might want to take a look at it's uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages. i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it
M:	i'm pretty sure they're just looking for a way to make money.
A:	so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
M:	the u. s. government is not the one that has to deal with the u.
A:	and the only other avenue that i can think of is uh looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. as for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars.
M:	
A:	and it was just i mean you can go to k-mart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats
M:	you know.
A:	so. so it gives you idea that
M:	i think you know?
A:	sure sure. so
M:	i think you need to go to a school to learn the military and military research is not done in school.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	you know there are some things that are better than this like the way the government works.
A:	than we think. sure. sure.
M:	so what's your point?
A:	uh-huh. it sure is. the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences. they were using it as eating out uh when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
M:	you.
A:	the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
M:	i love how is the idea of course they have a bunch of the military spending military spending money.
A:	and it's a real big crunch uh
M:	the.
A:	of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are uh spending money that does not belong to them. so
M:	what about the millions of people who have never been caught?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uh uh when they catch you uh'uh
A:	sure.
M:	well uh uh huh.
A:	uh-huh. exactly. and i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs
M:	that's a lot of money for a country that was so far away from being the most powerful nation in the world.
A:	but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use. i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's you know uh they didn't want to do it anymore.
M:	yeah
A:	so a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things. so i don't know.
M:	they are done
A:	okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening.
M:	you know
A:	uh-huh thanks.
M:	that's what i said.
A:	bye now.
