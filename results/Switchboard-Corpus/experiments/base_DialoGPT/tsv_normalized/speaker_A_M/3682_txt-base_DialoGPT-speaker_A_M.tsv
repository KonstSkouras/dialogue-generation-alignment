A:	if i have people over for dinner, i like it to be nice and relaxed.
M:	uh uh
A:	yeah. and so i don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
M:	yes. you can't get too much more, right?
A:	yeah.
M:	it's a little more of a chore.but, i'm trying to get out of it
A:	exactly.
M:	because i'm lazy
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah.it's
A:	yeah.
M:	oh.my.god.hahaha
A:	uh-huh
M:	yea i know.
A:	uh-huh, you'd just do it.
M:	what's a lasagna?
A:	.
M:	uh, can i just do that?
A:	yeah.
M:	you wanna do something?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yea. that is pretty much what it is.
A:	um. boy i like that.
M:	i was hoping for a little bit of a story, but we're going to do lasagna, garlic bread, and lasagna.
A:	yeah, well i'm planning a, and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
M:	you like lasagna?
A:	so tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
M:	huh. well, that's interesting.
A:	oh, yeah, uh-huh.
M:	i was gonna say that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well... have you done any?
A:	yeah, that's fun. uh-huh.
M:	so... yeah, it's fun
A:	yeah.
M:	so uh, what's the point of having a computer?
A:	yeah, that's a good idea.
M:	we should have a separate food truck.
A:	yeah.
M:	do you like the potato salad?
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh, yeah.
M:	how about you?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	... it's
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh.uhuh.uh
A:	yeah.
M:	you're a great, great, wonderful person.
A:	yeah, that's good. well, one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff, i just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
M:	heh, i love it.
A:	it's very easy to.
M:	i don't know if you've heard of this but i don'think you can do that.
A:	you don't like it?
M:	yeah, i don'like that.
A:	oh, you do, okay, yeah. i have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
M:	ah. well, i don't really like it.
A:	and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want, and then you just.
M:	you can't just'put'the chicken into the pan. you have to'put it in'it '.
A:	yeah, over uncooked rice
M:	you mean rice?
A:	and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.
M:	and you can microwave it
A:	it fluffs up, and it's really moist.
M:	i've never seen it like that before. how is it?
A:	uh-huh, wow, yeah.
M:	i think it's just a weird coincidence.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	yeah.
A:	well, i'll keep that one in mind.
M:	you'll get the same result when you cook it.
A:	yeah.
M:	you mean to say...
A:	yeah.
M:	... i don't know...
A:	uh-huh. yeah, you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,
M:	i don't know.
A:	or, you know semi .
M:	i mean you can't really do that with a spoon
A:	yeah.
M:	i mean, if you wanted to, i could get away from it.
A:	yeah. you put in, um
M:	but... i don't have any.
A:	let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice or,
M:	i think so.let's see
A:	it depends on, you can really vary it.
M:	i dont know, how many cups of rice?
A:	but you have to put the water in proportionally. i can't remember. i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.
M:	i don't think i've ever had a cup of water in a bath.
A:	yeah, flavor. uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i mean, you can't really'use'it for that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	mmmmmm, taste.
A:	um, let's see. i think it was an hour. i've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.
M:	oh, i know. it's a little... spicy.
A:	yeah. but, i think it's about an hour.
M:	so you do the same thing, and then you microwave it?
A:	or maybe it's only half hour. um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. you know, before it gets overdone.
M:	that's a great idea. i'll do it
A:	yeah.
M:	i mean, it's just chicken.
A:	um, i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
M:	yeah, i'm gonna have to do that.
A:	yeah, i liked your idea too, there.
M:	yea.i'll have to see what i can do.it's a bit hard to make the cooking go a little quicker
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but... it's not a soup.
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	ummm... how do you make soup?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's a thing
