M:	you
A:	and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
M:	they,...
A:	it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.
M:	that.
A:	and myself, i guess.
M:	if you could, sure.
A:	well   well, who, who else is going to do this, then?
M:	i guess you could, you know, just say you're the
A:	i mean, it's worked successfully in europe.
M:	the problem is, the government does not have the ability to do it.
A:	i've heard all these stories about, i travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in europe every year,
M:	i'm not sure, but i think it's a common misconception.
A:	and i find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people i talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity, and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
M:	yeah, it's a good thing, i find it odd that some people are against healthcare in general.
A:	as a matter of fact, if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm, say in germany or france, uh, that, i'm automatically taken care of,
M:	do you have a problem?
A:	i mean i don't even have to pay.
M:	... but then you have to take care of them
A:	well i,  uh, uh, i know it.
M:	
A:	i have a solution, you see. my solution, even though i'm rapidly approaching the, uh, the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid, i, i, my mother and father both, uh, uh, well, my father's not living but my mother is,
M:	h?
A:	and they are, um, of an advanced years, and when i see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on medicare and medicaid, i mean, the,  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
M:	uuh, uh
A:	and the extraordinary amounts, i know that, because those people vote, i mean, they're the ones who get out and vote, that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, i think,
M:	that's
A:	and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
M:	yeah, though
A:	that's right, i mean, it does,  seem like we're,
M:	
A:	now i noticed just the other day in the paper that, that medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness. so i
M:	no.
A:	well, i don't know, uh, we'll see how that goes.
M:	i think it's time to go to the doctor.
A:	i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment, but we'll see what happens.
M:	yes, but that's not a problem.
A:	well, listen, uh, i think i've, i've exhausted my, uh, self on, at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it.
M:	i'm... i'm sorry.
A:	okay?
M:	i'm fine with that
A:	see you next time. bye.
