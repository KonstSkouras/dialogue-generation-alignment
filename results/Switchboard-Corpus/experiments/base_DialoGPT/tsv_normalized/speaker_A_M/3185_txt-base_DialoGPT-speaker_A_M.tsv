M:	you know what? i'm not gonna say anything.
A:	well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six, and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty
M:	so, it's freezing.
A:	so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
M:	i'm going to be there, but i'm not going to
A:	you don't
M:	i'm sure it'll be cold by the time i'm ready for it.
A:	are you a summer person?
M:	i'm not.
A:	are you?
M:	you're welcome
A:	well, i have a friend who's the same way, and anything below sixty, she's just not happy but i, i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, my husband's from nebraska, and they have more of the four seasons.
M:	i can't imagine why you would be so cold.
A:	oh, you're used to that, too.
M:	i'm from the east coast, i'm used to it, but i like
A:	you don't like the cold. well, i usually like it about sweater weather, and the problem here in plano is it doesn't last very long.
M:	hmmm, here's
A:	it goes from hot, and then you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer, and then it's cold
M:	i like the weather.
A:	and i wish it were several months of that.
M:	a few months of it.
A:	well, i don't either unless it's like, uh, some of my favorite's like a friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go, and it's sleeping time. but if you have to get up and get out in it, i don't like it either
M:	i hate rain.
A:	oh, yeah. well, sure it does. that kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.
M:	why do you want. to.to.it.
A:	and also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
M:	well, i love it
A:	but i did a walk last night, and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
M:	oh, it's not. i'm not too sure about that, i don't think so.
A:	well, i agree, absolutely, and you know, it's all relative, because i was from west texas, and it was very dry, and so i thought dallas was awful, and i still think so, but then this summer we went to orlando for a week, and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning. they had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
M:	
A:	and when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to. but i agree with you, the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.
M:	i
A:	yes. i do not like the
M:	it's hot and humid and humid.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	no, i don t like rain.
A:	yeah, i think so too. i know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
M:	i think it's because they're sooo cute
A:	but it seems like here, i would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
M:	i like rain
A:	so, uh, but i, i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,
M:	well, i am going to be out of town for a few days.
A:	i guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.
M:	what do you mean, you think it's not a good time
A:	yeah. yeah, are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
M:	i'm from the nin'y's.
A:	yeah, yeah.
M:	you'll be fine.
A:	yeah.
M:	yes.yeah.yeah
A:	yeah, keep it there
M:	yeah, keep it
A:	yeah.
M:	do you like it?
A:	well, i do, too, i do, too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. but then we started thinking, especially in plano, the weather is so hot in august, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
M:	no. i stay in my house.
A:	static here.
M:	yep, i'm in the dorms right now.
A:	yeah. we do too. i think a lot of people agree the same.
M:	why?
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	i know!
A:	uh-huh, now there have been worse summers. in fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, harold taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,
M:	oh yeah, i know. i just don't like the weather.
A:	everybody seems to be, you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting, and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold, and they'll say, well those are the ones that like the cold weather.
M:	summer.
A:	oh, yeah, he did, he did. it was it was really a shame.
M:	you.yes.
A:	he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
M:	the weather
A:	it's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
M:	i'm just here for the weather.
A:	oh, is that right? okay.
M:	he's been gone for a while
A:	oh, good.
M:	it's ok, you don't need to wait too long.
A:	well good, well, then have a good day.
M:	she shrugs.
A:	and i hope you enjoy the weather this week.
M:	i hope so too.
