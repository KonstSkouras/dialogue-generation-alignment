M:	i think they're saying it's not too late to get back to work.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yea. uh.uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you have a good point. i wonder what the other people are like.
A:	you know i i really agree with you. um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there
M:	i
A:	and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home
M:	i know.
A:	and i did it um for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
M:	...
A:	and i it changed it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
M:	i think you should visit some places.
A:	and i think um in fact if i had to do it all again i you know after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back.
M:	uhh.
A:	um so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
M:	i
A:	um i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed
M:	i have time
A:	and i thought that was you know very interesting and i i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the mormon church that does that?
M:	yes of course
A:	because one of my neighbors uh did that in pittsburgh from pittsburgh.
M:	i uh i think i know what you mean.
A:	and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would have probably like you said to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country i think it would have been a very good um experience for me.
M:	us.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not really i'm
A:	uh-huh.
M:	... how about
A:	uh-huh. yeah. and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
M:	i'm so
A:	and i worked in a very rural school district and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class
M:	uuhuh
A:	and these kids um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant.
M:	i uh uh
A:	many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors.
M:	i'm not a child i'm a high school junior.
A:	and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to condition in poverty and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think it's a really good idea. and even if it is overseas.
M:	
A:	see i never i i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
M:	i'm
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm.of.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i'm from the uk.
A:	right. uh-huh.
M:	and it's still not the most popular country in the world.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh um. yes.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	because they are better than the other students.
A:	yeah. i think it would also help them if they then went on to college. i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning
M:	what if they have been in college for a while?
A:	and then at the end i had to be too serious.
M:	uhh i think they were just a bit too serious.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and then you get to be a little girl and get to hang out with them.
A:	yeah that's true.
M:	that's why you have to take a vow of poverty.
A:	uh-huh that's right.
M:	they do a lot of things that we don't.
A:	i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
M:	oh well yeah i guess that's interesting
A:	uh you know
M:	no i don't know.
A:	uh-huh. yeah that's true.
M:	because of the freedom of choices i guess.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uuhh that's uh weird.
A:	oh i think it is.
M:	no it's not.
A:	i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
M:	i think you're wrong i'm right.
A:	and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situation
M:	i find great disdain for them in their in the self centeredness in them self centered in themselves.
A:	and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand
M:	you know what you're right.
A:	uh-huh. yeah i think that's uh just having a good time.
M:	i know but uh i'm uh uh um i don't really understand
A:	i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented. i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it you know
M:	oh okay.
A:	today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented
M:	today's youth are the future of the world.
A:	and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.
M:	paper is a reward for a lot of things.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i think you can make your own.
A:	well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps.
M:	well it's the most peaceful thing i've ever heard.
A:	uh-huh. because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe uh they've increased funding for the peace corps. some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known
M:	uh uh yeah.
A:	when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the peace corps
M:	well they're not wrong.
A:	and some of the are the overseas programs. uh
M:	yeah some of them.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	yeah. yeah that's true.
M:	ohhuh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know maybe.
A:	yeah that's very true. you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near washington being in in baltimore it's something like one in four people in the washington  area are lawyers
M:	there are many lawyers.
A:	and and i just sort of think that's ridiculous.
M:	it's just a joke.
A:	yeah with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with aids and cancer and and how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
M:	
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	i can't believe that's how many people have been to the moon.
A:	uh-huh. yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
M:	
A:	yeah that's true.
M:	oh i see. i was thinking that the money would be the same as the money that doctors make.
A:	that's interesting. uh-huh.
M:	yes it is.
A:	okay. hey thanks so much for the conversation.
M:	i'll be around.
A:	well thank you very much. bye-bye.
M:	good luck with that.
