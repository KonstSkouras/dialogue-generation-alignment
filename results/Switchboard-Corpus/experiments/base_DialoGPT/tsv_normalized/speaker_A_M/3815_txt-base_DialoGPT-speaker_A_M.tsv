M:	what kind of car?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what kind of car?
A:	i see
M:	uh, uh, i'm not sure.
A:	top of, top of the line.
M:	how is this a thing?
A:	oh.
M:	you're not my friend.
A:	uh-huh. right, right.
M:	no, it's not.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	uhh, what?
A:	well, i guess i'm, uh, more traditional in that i don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
M:	oh, well, i guess that's how you feel.
A:	and, uh, so i don't, i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work
M:	why?
A:	and then i want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and i want an air bag and, uh, i guess,
M:	and that's, uh, it.
A:	no, i haven't. have you?
M:	have u ever?
A:	somehow i just think, you know, i like the idea
M:	i'm not sure, i have no idea.
A:	right.
M:	you sure?
A:	right, that's a good idea.
M:	i, actually, i like that idea.you know, because, uh, i think it'll, uh... save lives.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	how do you do it?
A:	well, i, actually i don't know a lot about different brands. i tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time i bought a car i, i guess i did sort of prefer american and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh, and i needed air-conditioning and, uh, can't remember what my, oh, i wanted uh, stick shift. and, so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that i could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
M:	
A:	it, it turned out to be a, a chrysler. uh lancer.
M:	no.
A:	yeah.
M:	a.uh. yeah, shift. shift.
A:	no, a five speed. and it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
M:	was it a three or four speed?
A:	so, i guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
M:	it was a manual.
A:	well, i just wanted it because, again, i had, i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable.
M:	i'll.
A:	uh,
M:	why do you like the stick shift?
A:	i found that out. i mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when i, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,
M:	i can't find any stick shift car that has a manual transmission.
A:	so,
M:	that's what i thought.
A:	well, i'm not even sure all of them are anymore. at least in this area.
M:	i am.
A:	not that i was looking for sports cars, but, now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
M:	i know the majority of people don't, but i'd be willing to drive a stick shift car if it meant driving manual.
A:	and so why do you like stick shift?
M:	i love stick shift.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know, i don't like stickshift.
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	it's like a car.
A:	right, and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active.
M:	i like the idea of it, but i don't know, i'm not a very good pilot.
A:	so,
M:	yeah, yeah.
