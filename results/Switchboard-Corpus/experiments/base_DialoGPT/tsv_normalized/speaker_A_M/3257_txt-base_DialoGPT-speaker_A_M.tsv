M:	i...
A:	and we start out with evening shade and major dad,
M:	i know, i'm like a hundred pages in.
A:	and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television.
M:	uhh, uh, uh
A:	you know my husband's always got it on.
M:	umm. that's what i'm trying to say.
A:	i'm not always sitting down, and,
M:	you mean you are?
A:	yes. yes, yes. i just, i love that, all those, that two hours
M:	what about monday night?
A:	and, uh, now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie, did you watch did you watch it?
M:	i've been watching a lot of commercials lately, i'm glad i'm not the only one.
A:	yeah, it, it was pretty good, it, uh, sometimes i like a dramatization, and i like, uh, u s a, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their made for t v movies
M:	weird, y'lame
A:	and, uh, i like those. we very seldom watch any, uh, public television, channel thirteen. do you watch it much?
M:	i watch it.
A:	yes.
M:	what?
A:	yes
M:	yes, and, you.
A:	now we haven't watched any of those.
M:	yes.and.you.can.watch.all.of.the.the.
A:	yes, now we have watched some things on that.
M:	that's the first time i've seen it.
A:	yeah, we had, uh, i don't know, my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel, so, you know, and he's sit in front of it and, and he went by and he said, whoops, and he backed up, and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know,
M:	i
A:	and i'm saying let's move right on
M:	it's
A:	but our grandchildren like that discovery channel if they're over here, because lots of times it will have things on, uh, animals
M:	so
A:	and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that
M:	i like to imagine that when the aliens are going to get to the surface, they'll be watching the discovery channel, with their children, and their grandchildren.
A:	in fact, i think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sharks, one or the other couple of weeks ago over here
M:	what did they say?
A:	and, uh, so we have watched that
M:	erm... um
A:	and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football
M:	uhhh, what?
A:	and, you know, i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else, you know with him.
M:	you mean, like, your husband?
A:	yes. yes, and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside, and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much saturdays and sunday, this is fine, but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know, all of that,
M:	
A:	and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around, i think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down. i don't know what channel he found that on
M:	i
A:	and, uh, but he will turn that on, especially for, if, again, if our, uh, oldest grandson is over here. he's ten
M:	
A:	and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, i, you know, i keep telling them it's the same mentality you know, and something's wrong, and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night, because we're not home
M:	yes,
A:	and, uh, so, and sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on sunday, so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos
M:	i'm, get, kids on, uh,
A:	do you ever watch that?
M:	
A:	yeah, uh-huh
M:	oh, you mean the funny stuff?
A:	that are sometimes so dumb
M:	i like the ones that are the ones with the funny music
A:	but very true to life, i mean, i've seen our family in several of those situations
