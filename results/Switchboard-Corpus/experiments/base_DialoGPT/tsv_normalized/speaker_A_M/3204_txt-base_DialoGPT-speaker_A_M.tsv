A:	and they're just really close here. and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
M:	well, the elderly people in the area are pretty old.
A:	and, uh, and i, that's hard to be a caretaker i really believe. it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
M:	i, uh, i think i'm gonna need to see some medical records.
A:	uh, she has alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything.
M:	do you have a problem with the others?
A:	and so she asks the same questions over and over again. which is not you know, unrealistic.
M:	i know, right?
A:	um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
M:	you have to ask the question.
A:	uh, i, uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
M:	i can't.
A:	she's ninety-two.
M:	oh, cool.
A:	oh, i think that's wonderful.
M:	he is my father
A:	well, uh-huh.
M:	but what would you do?
A:	yeah. i was just going to say.
M:	she's a nurse.
A:	yeah. um,
M:	you know, there's a place in kansas that has a nursing home.
A:	yes.
M:	it's a tragedy.
A:	uh, i think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
M:	uh, how do you know that?
A:	and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves. um,
M:	and so i said to them
A:	yeah, yeah
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	are you, uh, interested in any of this?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what's up?
A:	yeah.
M:	you okay?
A:	nursing homes.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	visit.
M:	how much would it cost?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's not that hard.
A:	they don't go and see them. that's right.
M:	... that's not true at all.
A:	that's right.
M:	it's a shame they don't see it that way.
A:	you know, um, i, i think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
M:	i think that's what they meant by'people '.
A:	i have to say that.
M:	uh... i've been to places.
A:	but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
M:	yes, but they do.
A:	um,
M:	do you want to see a kid with a mom?
A:	right, right.
M:	i'm saying that the real people in the world would be able to see them all day.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think you're in the wrong state, op.
A:	i hope so.
M:	hopefully so.that's good.but.so.bad.but.
A:	you know, it's, i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
M:	why do you think so?
A:	and then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, i'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
M:	yeah, that's what i was thinking.
A:	and, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision i think.
M:	i know
A:	uh-huh. i think that's right,
M:	i think you're
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
M:	i think it's possible, but it's not a good idea to be a medic and a caretaker.
A:	now i know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
M:	he can get a good doctor.
A:	and that might be a partial solution, or something.
M:	i think it's just an excuse to have a baby.
A:	but, um, i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever,
M:	the problem is that they're probably not trying it out in a home.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and then?
A:	well, i, i think we kind of are along the same lines.
M:	i don't think so.
A:	good to hear from you.
M:	i have a lot of stuff to do.it's a bit busy.
A:	have a lovely day.
M:	i, uh, i think i need to go...
