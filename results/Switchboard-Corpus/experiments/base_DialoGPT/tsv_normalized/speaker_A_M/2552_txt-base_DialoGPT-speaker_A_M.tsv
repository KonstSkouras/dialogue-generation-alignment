M:	?
A:	and then when i would come home and he would leave and um so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something. it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M:	
A:	and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. so there's one or two nights a week we have a on monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together.
M:	no
A:	yes.
M:	...
A:	oh you are?
M:	i'm not a monster.
A:	yes and
M:	you are.
A:	so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on saturday usually in the morning.
M:	we can do a night's
A:	right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday but we're it's real important to us to spend time together.
M:	it's. not.
A:	i have two.
M:	i'm sorry. i'm sorry i'm so sorry.
A:	uh-huh. i have a girl and a boy and the boy's five he's in kindergarten and the girl is four. she'll be in kindergarten next year. uh-huh.
M:	i'll be her friend.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	hmmmmmm... i have two.
A:	they are a handful.
M:	the only time i have ever been told that my kids are a lot of fun.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well uh i have no kids.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what about her?
A:	yes.
M:	uuh uh she?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah uh she's not dead
A:	uh-huh.
M:	huehuehuhueh.
A:	well no and it's it's just not um it's not as stable for the kids
M:	
A:	and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. but uh it's yeah.
M:	i think they're just not as funny as they used to be.
A:	well it's also important i think um for my husband. i i try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them.
M:	yes.
A:	so he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night. he puts the kids to bed
M:	i'm ahem.
A:	and he reads to them
M:	he sits down and i sit down
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that and that's that's pretty good quality time with them
M:	i don't know but he spends hours reading
A:	and um but it's hard for him on saturdays. he he wants right he wants to run out and get things done
M:	he has to be he's a lot of fun to watch.
A:	and so um i try to say well why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something.
M:	i uh don't think he's gonna he's uh... not a guy.
A:	and if i have something in mind then he he remembers that that's what he wants to do.
M:	... and then he he wants to go fly and do something.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what's your wife?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	they had a fun time running around and playing.
A:	yes.
M:	are they happy with your decision?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and we did they have kids?
A:	well that's right. but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated. it's not nearly as important.
M:	you.
A:	we find that you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family.
M:	i think.
A:	and families took care of themselves and um but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way.
M:	the family family families.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i know right?
A:	that's right and
M:	that and and
A:	right right
M:	i don't but i'm right.
A:	and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know i you know i have interests that too
M:	i'm not but i'm the one who's asking.
A:	and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life.
M:	no right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	oh. right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah uh.
A:	right.
M:	i think.
A:	it is temporary. it in the middle of it it seems like a long time
M:	it's
A:	but you're right it is temporary. well i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	that's true but it's still temporary.
A:	and and in spite of
M:	they are in the same house.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well it's a long shot but it's always the best idea.
A:	yes.
M:	do they have any children?
A:	that's true.
M:	i've never heard of a single girl having a son or daughter.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i know i'm just not sure about
A:	yeah.
M:	he just with.
A:	well it is the hardest thing i've ever done as much as you'd go out
M:	oh i know i'm just saying that it's not as bad as i thought it would be.
A:	and
M:	i'm sorry but...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah my wife uh likes that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uh she works in the bathroom.
A:	well that's good.
M:	i'm not going to lie. she's not going back to work.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	oh uh what's the deal with that?
A:	no. yeah i think so. i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious. you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong.
M:	yes.
A:	yes.
M:	i like.
