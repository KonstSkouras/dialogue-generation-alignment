M:	weird question how do you wear for work?
A:	sure.
M:	i don't know uhhhhh
A:	you bet.
M:	uhm uh huh.
A:	look professional
M:	i'm not.
A:	yeah i understand. i am a i own my company. i am in the i am uh manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
M:	you sound like you're in a bad place.
A:	but then when i travel it is a little different situation.
M:	you don't have to wear it.
A:	yeah i think in today's society uh there is more credibility to be quite honest
M:	you're
A:	i will always remember i will tell this real quick story when i graduated from college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty-nine years ago in fact was selling agricultural fertilizer.
M:	uh
A:	i worked for the uh smith douglas division of borden chemical and i sold uh you know manure.
M:	that's the kind of stuff i would never sell.
A:	and uh i would go out and call on farmers and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
M:	uhh.
A:	and so one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
M:	
A:	and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional
M:	uhh what did he expect?
A:	so uh it was sort of
M:	no it wasn't
A:	you bet even back then
M:	he didn't expect you to come back.
A:	so i sort uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best
M:	she does.
A:	but here again i dress casual quite a bit so
M:	... and here i am sitting in my dress.
A:	it gives you confidence. in my business if i call on the the j c penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago then i wear coat and tie. if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual.
M:	i don't know if it gives you any confidence.
A:	i call on oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie.  so it depends.
M:	what about the jacket?
A:	uh probably no.
M:	are you
A:	but then it depends on who you are calling on. who you're you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he would be missing something.
M:	i call it the.
A:	although he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
M:	but you can see the difference between the two
A:	so it's its' just different.
M:	because you know he's not.
A:	yes it is. i am uh like a catholic and the people that go to my church you know catholics dress very casual a lot of the times. people in jeans and in whatever but yet the way i was raised i am a converted catholic the way i was raised i was raised a baptist and like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time. i guess that has changed also.
M:	i'm.
A:	right.
M:	
A:	sure.
M:	that work.
A:	but .  that is a very good point. i am from west virginia so i understand what you are saying there
M:	it's a very big city in the us.
A:	and it's it's a very good point.
M:	no it's not.
A:	but you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
M:	i don't know i think it's pretty cool.
A:	and uh evaluation of an individual. course all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have. i think you have to dress sort of accordingly.
M:	i don't think you understand the concept of a job.
A:	but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that.
M:	oh. well i guess you're right.
A:	what about season to season. does i guess your dress changes.
M:	it varies from season to seasons.
