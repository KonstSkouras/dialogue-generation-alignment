M:	i think i'm just gonna...
A:	yeah.
M:	h uh i guess.
A:	huh.
M:	i think it's because it's a big house.
A:	it sounds nice.
M:	i'm going to start a new post for this if you're interested.
A:	oh yeah?
M:	it is.
A:	yeah. well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
M:	i know.
A:	and uh i'm insulating myself from that problem.
M:	because the economy
A:	i'm building my own house.
M:	what is your problem with them?
A:	and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that's going up today
M:	i am in the same situation.
A:	yeah.
M:	do you live in the back of the house?
A:	yeah.
M:	you mean the truck?
A:	i used to be a builder.
M:	??? you're a new player
A:	and i retired about five years ago and  started college.
M:	yeah.you?
A:	and now i'm a college educated builder  there's still no work you know.
M:	yeah i'm not sure. i'm still here.
A:	so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did.
M:	i know right?
A:	and uh see the the the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
M:	i have a friend who's a lawyer he's going to sue you for this.
A:	you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
M:	can you borrow money to buy your own house?
A:	well it's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
M:	what's the point of having a bank then?
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
M:	the bank is paying for it.
A:	well.
M:	i don't have a bank.
A:	as as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. right?
M:	that's why they call it a bag.
A:	hence the savings and loan problem we have.
M:	we have no money to buy.
A:	but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple. it's designed to be added on to.
M:	i think you're misunderstanding the question.
A:	yeah. well i figure it's just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot so i want  to have a shop.
M:	you do you ummm have you tried any other hobby?
A:	ten acres.
M:	do you have a lot of plants?
A:	well yeah. it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor. he's on the other side of a hill.
M:	i like the look of it.
A:	and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. seriously.
M:	he's right.
A:	well in the winter time i can see see another guy but you know he's
M:	what do you mean?
A:	i can just make out his place you know. i've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
M:	not in the sun.
A:	and uh
M:	and uh uh
A:	yeah. well i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the the house has no heating or air conditioning.
M:	well how about you?
A:	well it's got a a very small furnace.
M:	how do you like your...
A:	and a uh we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
M:	i'll make a fire.
A:	but in the house itself i've been working inside you know these these many months
M:	it's not that. it's the wood burning.
A:	and i have not had to use the heat.
M:	you've been using the heat?
A:	because it's all geothermal.
M:	why is the air so cold?
A:	and with all the see i've got on the south side is all glass. well as much as i could get in it you know. and uh the east side is glass.
M:	i have seen this.
A:	i've got one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. so it's almost all glass.
M:	no the west side is a lot more green.
A:	and uh
M:	i think if you're going to be that guy it's like if uh the east side of the mississippi it should be the east side of the state.
A:	oh yeah. i mean you know.  there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M:	i've always wondered why i've never seen any windows in my house.
A:	so uh
M:	i like windows.
A:	well not really. it's uh it's on the side of a hill.
M:	is that the only door?
A:	so the first you know the the the what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
M:	what is the second floor?
A:	and the side that's on the uh the other side is about six feet high.
M:	you know what?
A:	so i've got a pretty good grade there.
M:	he nods.
A:	and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop.
M:	i think you'll find it's a very confusing shop.
A:	exactly.
M:	i'm going to make a joke about it. i'm going out on a limb and saying that this is a victorian shop.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you can see the little shelf for the back of the shop in the picture.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh you know i'm a human.
