M:	i do it too, i've grown up around the area.
A:	i see.
M:	because we have a little plot, and a lot of plots.
A:	yeah, you do a lot more area than i do. i've, all the rest of my yard, backyard is, uh, you know, pool and decking it's all the dirt i have, left in my backyard
M:	that's a lot of dirt.
A:	well, i i enjoy fiddling around. it's cheap entertainment.
M:	i don't think i've ever seen a good game of pool in my life.
A:	it is, uh-huh.
M:	i think i'm going to be out.
A:	that's right. yeah.
M:	you know, it's kind of cool.
A:	i enjoy,  excuse me, go ahead. uh-huh.
M:	... but i'm not a girl
A:	uh-huh.
M:	umm, um.
A:	that's right. that's right. uh-huh.  uh-huh.  takes a lot of room.
M:	you know, i love, uh
A:	it sure does. i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was.
M:	does it
A:	they do. well, it was very good it just takes up, you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area.
M:	what? no.
A:	it's the first and only time i've done that. we don't do anything exotic we just do, oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, i mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	my wife used to plant a few snow peas. i don't really care for snow peas. well, she just plants a few for herself.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	yeah.
M:	we do
A:	did you really?
M:	i got a snow peas last night.
A:	oh, i see.
M:	they arent. they are in the garden.
A:	okay. we don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
M:	no, it's not.
A:	probably so. yeah, you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	that's the plan. i have a lot of practice
A:	i guess it, it, might would,
M:	but, uh, i don't, i'm a woman, so...
A:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	because of?
A:	well it will make, it will make them taste better i'm sure.
M:	i, i don'know.
A:	sure. you got to inspect it, yeah.
M:	that's the point of the place.but i don'think you'll be able to find it in time.
A:	sure.
M:	do you like it?
A:	sure.
M:	i like swinging.
A:	yeah.
M:	you know what i mean.
A:	no.
M:	do you?
A:	i, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,
M:	not if you live in the home we have.
A:	and boy, it is really nice,
M:	the whole country is beautiful.
A:	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
M:	it's not a home we're living in, it's a home they're living at.
A:	that's right. that's right. it's really nice.
M:	yes, and that's why it's called a'' road''.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's been a while.
A:	i'll have to admit i don't, i do my own yard. i, i really don't enjoy doing that. i enjoy having a nice looking yard,
M:	you have a nice yard.
A:	i just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done.
M:	uuhhh, how come?
A:	i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, you know, until i retired
M:	how do you get a lawn?
A:	and now i, i've lost my excuse for that so i have to for the last couple of years i've done it myself.
M:	uhm... no.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	how about an e?
A:	it is kind of expensive, it is.
M:	... i have no idea what that is.
A:	of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
M:	they're not expensive.
A:	that's right. if i have a problem discipline, you know, i think, now, boy, i really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	that's right.
M:	you'll get high if you do that, boy.
A:	that's right. i'm, i'm kind of bad about that.
M:	you're, you're, it's, it was, it is
A:	i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really can't, i really you know, don't,  want to spend the money for it.
M:	you have to do it yourself.
A:	yeah. that's right. i'm not limited to, just mowing it on saturday morning, you know,
M:	you know, i just have
A:	i can do it on most any day of the week.
M:	why not on the weekend?
A:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	you can do that.
A:	yeah.
M:	do you do it?
A:	yeah.
M:	they are.
A:	that's coming up here pretty soon. is it this weekend?
M:	they have an hour left.they are just gonna rollback a lot of the servers.
A:	it's pretty soon.
M:	when is the patch coming?
A:	yeah.
M:	wait... is it the same as last year?
A:	i believe it is too.
M:	wait, what?
A:	well,
M:	i'm not sure.
A:	uh, not a whole lot, uh. i, i don't use, i, i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
M:	i know.
A:	i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then, again, i don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
M:	... what do you mean?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you're... i'm not sure
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i've been using it for a year. i've been having issues with it
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh.
M:	you can't tell me what to do!
A:	yeah.
M:	uuhh, i'm not sure, i think it was broccoli.
A:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	yes, but i was not able to get out of the plant.
A:	absolutely. they really go through it,
M:	he's still there.
A:	they really do. yeah.
M:	they really do.
A:	you know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
M:	yeah, and they eat the tomatoes
A:	boy, they'll strip,
M:	they'll strip you of your tomatoes, and then turn you into a tomato.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh.
M:	yeah. uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, they're a good company.
A:	i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before, i've got, my garden is shaped that i can, it's kind like this, uh, box shape, so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
M:	lolpt : ummm
A:	and, you know, various other things, raised it up.
M:	you know, i am so happy that you put this up.
A:	and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have, oh, i'll have less of a bug problem at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
M:	good
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	so what you are saying is, you're gonna build a roof
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what do you think?
A:	yeah, right.
M:	you know, i think, that's how they do it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well, i mean, i can't really help you with that, but i can help you.
A:	that's right, you, you have to work on. you, really do.
M:	i do, but not to my liking.
A:	that's right. when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden so i had, i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
M:	lol, it's good
A:	no. i don't, i did it by hand,
M:	you know what i meant, i don '?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	hmmm.hm.hm. how did you do it?
A:	it wasn't too much of a job,  really.
M:	not that much, just a lot of work.
A:	like i say it's just,
M:	oh, i see.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. it would be handy.
M:	hahaha i can't do that.
A:	yeah.
M:	that's just, like, your opinion, man.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well, you can just see the picture of the tree...
A:	yeah.
M:	he's the one that runs the dog park.
A:	it might be handy,
M:	i like the idea of it.
A:	they're pretty neat little, i've never seen one.
M:	i don't think you can use the gun with a gun in it.
A:	uh-huh. oh, yeah.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	yeah. uh-huh right. yeah. that would be neat, sure.
M:	do you?
A:	we've had a garden, gosh, for years and years and years, of some size, you know,
M:	i have never heard of a garage.
A:	i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.

A:	yes, i've for the first time we planted them this year.
M:	do you have any onions?
A:	yeah. we tried to find them last year, we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
M:	i thought they were the best. i think we found them in the first year.
A:	but we've got some this year.
M:	the leaves are so green, they're just not ripe.
A:	snow peas are up and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.

M:	they made some kind of funny looking onion ring,
A:	they were. that's right.  we use a lot,  we sure do.
M:	i bet they're a lot.
A:	yeah. one nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, you know, too many.
M:	i dont think you can, they arent really that good.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. we did that too,
M:	so what did you guys eat?
A:	uh-huh. sure. makes, uh, makes a colorful salad too.

A:	we planted some yellow peppers this year. we've tried it, before
M:	we're gonna make a green bowl.
A:	and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
M:	i can't wait to see what we do with this
A:	they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
M:	i have a couple of yellow peppers.
A:	yeah. we enjoy fooling around with it.
M:	i think it's a common practice.
A:	beets. yeah, we've got some beets, uh-huh.

A:	that will be neat, yeah. absolutely, they're expensive.
M:	uhm. i think you need to pickle your own.
A:	i don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. i really, don't know.
M:	so... what's the difference between them?
A:	that will be interesting.
