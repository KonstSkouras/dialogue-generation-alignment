M:	
A:	so if they would come up, curbside recycling,
M:	well, i can
A:	well, now have they moved them behind wal-mart?
M:	it's too late.
A:	oh, god.
M:	they're in the recycling bin.
A:	oh. that's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing. because to take it to a metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
M:	i'm just saying, you know.
A:	and so when that thing came up in wal-mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great. and we started taking them up there. and then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know i didn't know. and we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.
M:	you
A:	that's really nice to find out that it's behind there well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers. i couldn't even think of what you call them.
M:	they do.
A:	plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, i guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.
M:	i am?
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	so, uh, do we have any other food?
A:	and really, that's about, that's really about it. is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?
M:	that is the only thing that we really do.
A:	oh, really.
M:	i think you mean dallas.
A:	i know.
M:	do you?
A:	i know. i know. we're kind of the same way. you know, at first, you know, you, at first it was a real, it was a real hassle, and i'm wondering are we really going to do this, but you kind of get, i guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,
M:	
A:	you know. so i just go, you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there, you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
M:	you know, got some.
A:	so.
M:	i mean you're, i'm going to, i've been, i know.
A:	oh, they do, too. and they're impossible to crush. i mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know. if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily, so. you know,
M:	i
A:	oh, really.
M:	yeah, it's a little less than a year old.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	so you were in a car.
A:	oh, that will be good.
M:	just don't go
A:	sure. let somebody get something out of it.
M:	you.
A:	yeah
M:	the government won't give it away.
A:	ha-ha well, i was kind of hoping with, you know, do you work for t i?
M:	it's a good thing.
A:	no. yeah. there was a, t i has got this organization called t a d which is t i'ers against drugs. and, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know, and that's, they use the money from that to fund this t i'ers against drugs program. it's, you know, t i doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that. and they had talked about having a thing like, one saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
M:	
A:	and i'm kind of like, yeah. i shall, they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. that was going to use it for good, so,
M:	
A:	sounds like you have a little one just like i do
M:	i.
A:	yeah. mine was two in december
M:	i don't have any in the bank.
A:	well, it was good to talk to you.
M:	i hope you enjoyed your time here.
A:	oh, do they really. curbside pick up?
M:	my dad was there.
A:	i really hope they do that in louisville. it would make it a lot easier on all of us. talk to you later.
M:	they're coming to the louisville area next week. i'm not sure what part of the city they're going to be in.
A:	bye-bye.
