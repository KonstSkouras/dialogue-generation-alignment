M:	
A:	and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in.

A:	and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh.
M:	i'll go fishing for you're fishing you fishing they're fishing.
A:	well no actually he had no trouble at all. he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before.
M:	what a great story. he's so good.
A:	but he jumped in in the the river.
M:	he's in the river.
A:	well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water
M:	did the puppy jump in the river?
A:	'cause if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her. and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
M:	why is it so wet?
A:	and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon. he loved it.
M:	
A:	cocoa didn't think too much of it though. she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
M:	you
