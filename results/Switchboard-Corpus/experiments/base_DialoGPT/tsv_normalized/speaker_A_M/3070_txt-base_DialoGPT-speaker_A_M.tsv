A:	on my mother's side we've had several, not,  it's not really on a regular basis,
M:	you guys ever have a fight in the middle of the night?
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers. well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
M:	we've been to every summer since we were kids.
A:	so they're pretty much just reunited always
M:	it's been like that for a while
A:	so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
M:	i dont know
A:	i know, that's
M:	well, it's a good thing i'm here, i'm just gonna be alone for a while
A:	do that, that's true.
M:	he could be your grandfather, your father, your mother, your so, your son, your friend, your best friend, etc.
A:	how about your family?
M:	i'm not a very good person.
A:	wow, you're,  a pro at this.
M:	i'm... not sure if i should laugh or cry.
A:	oh, that's good.
M:	no, he just said that he is very good at this.
A:	and then where do you meet?
M:	i think the only place i've ever met them was in the civil war
A:	okay.
M:	it's not in my state.
A:	okay. do you have relatives in vernon then?
M:	... yeah...
A:	okay.
M:	well, uh, uh.
A:	right.
M:	he nods. yeah.
A:	oh.
M:	he was only around for a few years.
A:	right.
M:	his descendants
A:	oh.
M:	it's okay, i'm a second generation, i was raised by my father.
A:	right.
M:	they are
A:	okay, so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,
M:	what is this?
A:	okay.
M:	it's a town hall. it's not a church.
A:	potato salad and, uh,
M:	i just eat a potato salad and, uh, eat it.
A:	oh, that's good.
M:	i know, i know.
A:	right.
M:	well, we are trying to bring potatoes to the party
A:	right.
M:	we are very aware of the human condition.
A:	oh, that's nice.
M:	take home baked bread
A:	right.
M:	yeah.but i'm not the one who likes bread.right.well.
A:	do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,  so that's what they get to cook.
M:	yeah, that's why i don't cook.
A:	well, that's good. well , i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions, so i learned a lot about them. i haven't,  been to a lot,
M:	i don't know, i've been to the us.
A:	but we talked,  a lot about the, the rituals,
M:	um, uh, i don't think so.
A:	you all equated the family reunions as,  with the protestant.
M:	they are.
A:	it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage.
M:	that's the catholic version of it, not the catholian version.
A:	it was, it was an interesting theory. she talked about the, uh, the catholics all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway, so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all, your, you don't have to come home, so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe, but when the protestant ethic happened in america, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became their version of the pilgrimage.
M:	
A:	but she had, it was interesting, you know, i don't know how valid it is, but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement. do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year? is there kind of a, you know, salads go first and things like that?
M:	
A:	right.
M:	h.
A:	well, that's pretty .
M:	you
A:	sure does. that's wonderful.
M:	...
A:	yeah. i wish we'd,
M:	oh... that's so nice.
A:	right.
M:	i'm a girl.
A:	right.
M:	oh.
A:	wow. you're just, uh, oh, that's incredible.
M:	we.
A:	right.
M:	what's the worst?
A:	right
M:	no. it was a joke.
A:	have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?
M:	right, and
A:	oh.
M:	i think it was
A:	see, that's we've we had a problem with that.
M:	we
A:	oh.
M:	he died in the second half of the first season.
A:	right. that's our, was our problem.  we had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
M:	i, uh, what?
A:	and then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
M:	the second reunion, uh, what?
A:	and so it kind of wound down,
M:	but it's still not a thing, right?
A:	and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the shreveport relatives there, but no one else so that,
M:	you know, you're not wrong.
