M:	yes
A:	well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin i was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue. i don't know if it will come out.
M:	i
A:	yeah the cheese fondue i make some people like swiss um i prefer cheddar. and i'll mix i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because it for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar.
M:	'
A:	and then i was going to make other things like potato skins.
M:	what?
A:	see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff. and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable.
M:	that sounds good.
A:	oh yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party.
M:	i think it's more that i have more of a vegetable
A:	yeah instead of something greasy or
M:	i like to eat it with my
A:	my uh girlfriends do catering and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray. i think they try and suggest it.
M:	i'm not sure what you mean by that but i do.
A:	what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kabobs. you take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry and even banana if you can do it just before you leave.
M:	i can make you eat a lot of food uh food.
A:	it stays nice and fresh.
M:	well it's nice to have some food uh and... food.
A:	yeah. yeah i like those
M:	you
A:	um they they made a couple of those uh they made one for my uh bridal shower and i was pretty pleased. i never made one for myself though. but they look easy enough to make it's not
M:	they are good.
A:	yeah.
M:	oh.yeah.but it would um be very uh difficult to make a thread
A:	yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done.
M:	i know
A:	then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water.
M:	yeah i've never used the water pump but i've heard that you can use the pump to get out the water.
A:	yeah um something i do is a fruit is i'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them. yeah i have two nieces and they they they go melt some chocolate chips go buy me some strawberries.
M:	nope i don't.
A:	yeah you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry
M:	i know
A:	huh. yeah no they um the strawberries are coming in season now from  they're they're coming up from florida of course. i live in vermont so. but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from florida so.
M:	so coming
A:	yeah.
M:	are they?
A:	yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from south america.
M:	...
A:	yep they a lot of um of a um winter produce comes from south america.
M:	i think they have uh some uhm winter produce coming from south america.
A:	of course their seasons are switched.
M:	you uh might want to check your math.
A:	so um do you want to discuss the recipe?
M:	they do but i'm not sure about how much they're worth.
A:	i have a recipe if you want
M:	i'm not sure.
A:	um it filled  a lot of people try to stay away from this but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding.
M:	i think you should be careful.
A:	yeah it and it if you um well first of all i take about a quarter and a half of milk and i put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat.
M:	wait what?
A:	and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot.
M:	i
A:	i don't let that worry me. and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender it it makes the uh it makes uh a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough. it's uh i don't know they're called moo goo leaves or something they're
M:	
A:	yeah. they're real neat.
M:	you
A:	i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one i got the black and decker kind. but uh it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it. i guess you could use a hand mixer but i don't think it i don't think it gets it good enough.
M:	.
A:	and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good. and then about a half a cup of sugar and i let it pretty much i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in. and it's the the trick is is to have this blender so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders. and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes seven to ten minutes
M:	laughs
A:	and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and let it cool you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes french vanilla um custard. yeah
M:	 defic
A:	a chocolate powder.
M:	.
A:	yeah that cocoa yeah the unsweetened. it comes in like a real dark can
M:	is that a real cocoa powder?
A:	our mothers used to use it. and then
M:	it's not even cocoa powder. it's chocolate.
A:	yeah we all used to
M:	i used to eat that stuff.tis a good source of vitamin c
A:	yeah  it's the unsweetened kind it's not like nestles quik.
M:	what is unsweet tea?
A:	i suppose you could use that.
M:	yeah i'm not a fan of the taste
A:	yeah but um
M:	cooked chocolate is so good
A:	well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red and i'm like oh this is kind of groedy .
M:	what does it taste like?
A:	um actually i found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks i mean something she had collected out of woman's day or something.
M:	... did you?
A:	so
M:	what's?
A:	i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um
M:	a hand whisk?
A:	yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the cornstarch
M:	beats me. i'm not a fan of that kind of stuff.
A:	um yeah  right in the in the lukewarm milk. sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good. it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top.
M:	you
A:	yeah. and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after i pour that into my back into my saucepan. i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg. so
M:	my.
A:	yep. and then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to. the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more.
M:	the.
A:	because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this.
M:	the
A:	because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less
M:	i.
A:	but i put it in a nice glass bowl and um some people don't like that that film on the pudding so you can put uh saran wrap over the top.
M:	i think i like in a so
A:	and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap so when you pull the saran wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap and i might put it back on. but um
M:	i
A:	yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
M:	yeah uh yeah yeah
A:	but um i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard.
M:	i'll be back.
A:	that's  yeah
M:	i know right?
A:	so that's why i do that.
M:	i can see the future.
A:	so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe.
