M:	i'm sorry?
A:	oh, my.
M:	you
A:	yeah,  so the convenience,  right.
M:	it's.
A:	my grandmother lived with us, um, until august, um, and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home. she has leukemia
M:	thanks.gif
A:	and her, the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton, and were several thousand miles away
M:	... um, how did she die?
A:	so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home, and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility. she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set
M:	no
A:	so.
M:	i don't think so.
A:	yes. and that, the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days, and would have to be hospitalized a day or two, so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
M:	it's fine
A:	so she didn't have to be transported back and forth. so, she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well. it's not her favorite place to be in. she'd much rather be here with me. but when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her,
M:	
A:	and i've got little children here who needed me here she needed somebody to watch her twenty-four hours a day.
M:	she's so she's just fine.
A:	so. she was falling down and hemorrhaging and, you know, all kinds of physical problems, so it just became too much for me to handle, even though i would have liked to have had her stay, with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore.
M:	it
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah.
M:	weep.
A:	oh.
M:	he had to get.it was.in.greee.me.up
A:	yeah.
M:	oh. that's unfortunate.
A:	yes, well, i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age, other people have to kind of help them make decisions. it sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home, but she's accepted it real well now
M:	i'm pretty sure that's why he left, he didn't want to be the only one.
A:	so.
M:	i know.
A:	well, we enjoyed having her here,
M:	she's not that old, she's a year old now
A:	but we feel she's much safer where she is now. she still continues to fall, but when she does there, a nurse is right there to help her
M:	and she's very calm.
A:	and i know she's eating the right things, and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her, so. it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
M:	... i'm so sorry.
A:	so, i think she'll adjust,
