A:	my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons and i was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me. and it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. it is real relaxing.

M:	you
A:	my my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the the people that have written certain songs then he buys the pieces that have that person. you know on it.
M:	oh... i guess that's a good idea

M:	i.
A:	yeah where are you?
M:	are you in this picture?
A:	okay. so we're in garland.
M:	i'm in the same area
A:	yeah
M:	you know i'll just walk over to the other side of the river.
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	i know. i'm in east texas.
A:	just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else
M:	why are you talking about the internet?
A:	for colleges?
M:	i know right?
A:	well they're not
M:	i'm from east texas.
A:	they're not going to recruit me anymore i'm through. no more for me.
M:	the east texas school of engineering has a very large enrollment.
A:	what what do you do?
M:	i do.
A:	are you going to go to east texas for that?
M:	i'll be going to a state school in the northeast and that'll be the best part.
A:	that'd probably be pretty interesting. i was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. they had summonsed eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial.
M:	lol
A:	this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.
M:	what?
A:	and they had us fill out a long questionnaire. we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until june.
M:	june
A:	and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summonsed. i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed. well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
M:	
A:	yeah.
M:	
A:	the the investigator. yeah he he got off right away.
M:	i
A:	and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that
M:	he said he'd get it back.
A:	so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen.
M:	i'm not sure i just know that i was told to say that i wouldn't have to say anything.
A:	hopefully
M:	i'll do it.
A:	yeah. no. *aa
M:	i mean what would be the point of voting for you?
A:	i said that i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
M:	
A:	you know. uh-huh.
M:	i know.
A:	yeah. but then when you're when you're picked see i was picked for another murder trial before
M:	i'm so sorry
A:	oh gosh and it's so hard because you know everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision.
M:	well
