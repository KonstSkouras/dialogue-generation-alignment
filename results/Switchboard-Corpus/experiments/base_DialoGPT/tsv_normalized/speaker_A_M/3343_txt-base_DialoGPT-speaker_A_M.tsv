M:	don't you mean the game?
A:	right.
M:	you know i usually have to check things.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uuhuh. uhuh.
A:	of course uh-huh.
M:	and we've been saying this for a long time but we've never had it work so we've always been able to
A:	right
M:	because of the whole uh thing?
A:	right just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
M:	uh i'm not sure what you mean.
A:	we're we're a wasteful society for sure.
M:	i agree. i'd rather be poor than have a high cost of living.
A:	right. right. and you usually get what you pay for. we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for christmas and they were like ten dollars and we expected them to work nice for the little kids and they didn't work worth anything
M:	you're
A:	so we took those back and that's about that all that were taken back in ages.
M:	i can be fixed a lot of money.

M:	you know what?
A:	oh really. it's hard.
M:	the lemon law is pretty difficult to enforce.
A:	oh wow.
M:	yeah. it's a very slow process but we can't really do anything without a lemon.
A:	uh-huh and it just pertained to that
M:	... and it was just you know not very
A:	i at first i thought of food you know because that's what mainly what i buy it seems like and uh you know i still don't have any anything to do there but but i i think too a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one
M:	...
A:	so.
M:	that's not that.
A:	yeah my husband is really good at fixing things too so he usually be able to fix anything that's minor and and that has saved us thousands of dollars you know from to mechanic to anything like that
M:	that.
A:	but but it was interesting to i don't know if they're making them better or not i it's hard to say. some i think they more of their parts plastic which you know makes things break easier but i think the technology is better.
M:	ayea
A:	about quality.
M:	ohh why you.
A:	right.
M:	yeah but i'm you know the one that's being made
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	do you?
A:	right. well people aren't willing to pay those prices very often so you know for a handcrafted something so
M:	i think it's a bit overpriced.
A:	so. so if we get what we what we deserve
M:	we got what we wanted.
