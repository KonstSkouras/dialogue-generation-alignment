M:	i live in planos
A:	well, good to hear. i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania.
M:	yes, we're in the middle of the us.
A:	really?
M:	we have a decent number of people from utah
A:	all right. well, good to hear, good to hear.
M:	yes. yes it is.
A:	which one?
M:	i was the first person to ask about the team.
A:	oh, yeah.
M:	ah, right.
A:	the utah jazz.
M:	what is utah?
A:	yeah, they're, they're pretty good. they've got some good good, some good, uh, good players out there.
M:	hey! that's pretty good.
A:	well, you ready for new year's eve?
M:	i don't know.
A:	good. should we, uh, start this so we can,
M:	i'm in the military, i don't know how to use my phone
A:	what was your name again?
M:	he nods.
A:	nancy, that's right,
M:	she nods.
A:	and i'm brian.
M:	i'm brian.
A:	just a moment okay nancy, then i guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.
M:	i'm brian.
A:	what, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?
M:	i'm not a scientist.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	um... what?
A:	oh
M:	uh, you know, i don't have any special qualifications.
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh.
M:	um hmm
A:	to, to compensate for some of the benefits.
M:	why do you hate free?
A:	oh.
M:	i'm a doctor.
A:	yes.
M:	wait. you don't need insurance for a month?
A:	well, that, that's an excellent, so actually that is a benefit, uh,
M:	no, i mean like i get to work 7 days a week, and then i can't work 7.5 days a month.
A:	yeah.
M:	i think it's a benefit of being a'long time'employee.
A:	right. right, well i guess that's a good point, uh,
M:	i'm just not really interested in any of that.
A:	i do belong to a, a large corporation or my, that where i'm currently employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
M:	i
A:	and that got to be somewhat expensive, so i i think one of the benefits i, i see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount.
M:	it's a business.
A:	yes.
M:	yup.
A:	yes, and that's, that's one thing i do have.
M:	but you have the option to be in a family or a group.
A:	if i didn't have a family, i don't think i would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, i don't think i would have insurance, uh, other,
M:	i mean, you don't have to be rich to have insurance.
A:	i don't think i would go through that expense. one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work, uh, nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours
M:	i
A:	or i could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. and make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.
M:	work, i'm, uh, yeah, yeah
A:	well, basically, yeah i had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. i mean uh, because i was in a, in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that, uh, i needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel,
M:	
A:	so, so i, i think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
M:	you,
A:	and i don't have that in my current operation, but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.
M:	i'd have a, uh, uh.
A:	and, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?
M:	yeah, uh, i don't, uh, i don t, i think, uh...
A:	yeah, yeah, that's true.
M:	you said, uh, retirement, and i said, uhh, you said...
A:	well, and that's an individual thing.
M:	well, i'm sure that's why i'm still in school.
A:	yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. if we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times
M:	i
A:	and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,
