M:	my plan is to wake me up earlier.
A:	don't get enough sleep as it is, right
M:	you do?
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
M:	... what?
A:	you feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
