M:	well that's what i'm saying.
A:	you know what i mean?
M:	i know uh huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	yeah i know.
A:	right.
M:	right.
A:	that's it.
M:	there is no way that i could live with that.
A:	well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could could it you you know change the system. i i really think that uh we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime. there's uh no question
M:	.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. you know all these things. i mean you know we've gone through this over and over again.
M:	you can't or we know
A:	and it can go on for ten twenty years.
M:	i'm not.
A:	i i think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	well the trial is a bit of a stretch.
A:	i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
M:	well i know what i'm doing with my life.
A:	i i'm serious. and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. with plea bargaining.
M:	i'm serious. i'm pretty sure that there are a lot more of those people in the legal system than you think.
A:	you know if someone is
M:	i think he's a sociopath.
A:	well.
M:	i know it. i'm a lawyer.
A:	well i know. that's what i'm saying. but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard. i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly  but  you know they get lesser sentences
M:	but i don't know that's the whole system.
A:	and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh  and that they have to do something.
M:	that's what the
A:	but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
M:	yeah they know.
A:	you know what i'm saying? that we don't have uh well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
M:	... because we're a state.
A:	and uh i i think they should.
M:	i think you should get rid of capital punishment.
A:	i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that kill people and uh you know all
M:	i think you misunderstand what i am saying.
A:	they they're caught dead to rights. i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life.
M:	it's a quote from the movie'the prestige '.
A:	yeah.
M:	no i'm uh i am.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what do you mean?
A:	oh really.
M:	no he didn't. he was arrested.
A:	it uh yeah.
M:	he got out?
A:	i know that that  uh-huh. and i don't know. uh what would you do to change it? to make it better?
M:	it's u i am the law i know.
A:	oh yeah. i i i don't agree with that at all.
M:	yes.
A:	imagine the guilt that person would have. i mean  burned out.
M:	you... i don t i?
A:	there's  there's no possible way that you could uh you know feel good about yourself.
M:	i... i don't know.
A:	if you had to do something like that day after day.
M:	i feel like that would be a good way to go.
A:	no. not really.
M:	so what do you think is the ideal outcome?
A:	well do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like
M:	yes because the people who were arrested are guilty of murder.
A:	i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you.
M:	how do you know that?
A:	in other words you're saying that you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
M:	i'm saying that there is a difference between being right and being right.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm pretty sure you can.
A:	yeah.
M:	that's what i said.i think that you can remove the judge.but can't you remove the defendant.and it's not like there's a jury.
A:	well i i
