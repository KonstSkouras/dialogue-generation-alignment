M:	what??? i've been doing this for months.
A:	oh so this is the first time i've even done it.
M:	yup you're right
A:	i wonder how long it's going to be on for.
M:	it's been on for a few minutes now
A:	oh no i mean this whole thing like for two months or something do you know?
M:	i'm not sure. i was just going to post it here.
A:	yeah okay well back to crime i guess we're supposed to talk about that. they say what aspect are you worried about well i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect
M:	i'm not sure.
A:	i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from.
M:	.the.very.very.
A:	uh-huh golly i know.
M:	what are you gonna do?
A:	have they done that in garland?
M:	there are a few shootings in garland and a few in the southside.
A:	now um
M:	i'm sorry i don't speak english.
A:	right.
M:	i think they did.
A:	well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school.
M:	i was just thinking about that i think it would be a good idea to have them in the school and then some.
A:	and the one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesn't seem like.
M:	and we have the two most important gun rights in the world.
A:	so. yeah it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot. i mean we didn't have to worry about that before.
M:	the.joke.about.this.
A:	what next?
M:	no it's not
A:	right and you know we can't really depend on the police to solve all this they just can't do it.
M:	it's the police. they can't help you but they can
A:	i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
M:	i don't know it just goes all around.
A:	and uh and how we going to bring that back together.
M:	and uh and uh
A:	uh-huh. right and
M:	i think that uh that's a lot uh.
A:	i think so and and then there's a drop in uh the training of morals really you know.
M:	that is uh interesting.
A:	these some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
M:	this uh doesn't uh. nothin ' uh...
A:	i think i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
M:	it was probably in a place that had no laws and no laws enforced by the police.
A:	i think it was just rare i really do.
M:	what was it?
A:	my mother well she's like seventy-four now. she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in california and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both and uh
M:	that's
A:	no i'm the one
M:	no you're the one
A:	yeah that must have been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers all over the country for weeks
M:	
A:	but now you know you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas
M:	this is so weird.
A:	it's just you know another killing.
M:	what is it?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	they were talking to the murderer so it was probably a murder
A:	um. uh-huh. uh-huh. right lots of their picture and life story and everything.
M:	what did they say?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uhuh.uhuh.uuhuhuh.
A:	right.
M:	they are all friends with the same person.
A:	right. i know how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
M:	they're a bunch of twisted people.
A:	so uh that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in arlington when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
M:	i think it's because of the recent scandals.
A:	yeah i think it was on a hard copy she was a real attractive blond girl in in her freshman year of college
M:	oh i see. so she was in high school
A:	and some boy she tried to get rid of he was like in his twenties
M:	she was a girl right?
A:	remember that?
M:	i remember seeing her in a movie and i remember she was like... a little over a year old.
A:	right right that's uh
M:	i remember that right right
A:	my daughter graduated with her from arlington high school.
M:	are you sure you are a middle school girl?
A:	yeah can you believe it that's just uh
M:	i'm in high school can you explain?
A:	taco bueno right uh-huh.
M:	what did he do?
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	that's the best part.
A:	yeah uh uh isn't that weird?
M:	uhh i think that's just weird.
A:	i know and uh the police are not going to do anything until they they've committed some sort of a crime. you know he was just begging her on the phone that's not doing anything.
M:	but uh i'm a guy.
A:	and there are times i think gee i should give my kids
