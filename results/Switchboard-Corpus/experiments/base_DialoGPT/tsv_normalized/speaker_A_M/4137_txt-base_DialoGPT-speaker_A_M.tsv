M:	well, i am
A:	no, regardless of that fact. it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. i'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
M:	american?
A:	and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away.
M:	i don't think so, but i'm not sure.
A:	handling, power, everything. yeah, it just got like the top rating. it was compared up against, uh, let's see, there was like the mazda m x three, uh, nissan's, whatever, their two, n x two thousand, the civic s i and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them. everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it. i like the, i like the styling and, i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it.
M:	...
A:	mustang g t uh, can't afford it.
M:	
A:	right, yeah, i'm a graduate student and, let's face it, i don't make any money so,
M:	you're.
A:	yeah. yeah, we'll see then. yeah, right now i'm stuck, i, i've got a, a pontiac sunbird turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing. but it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the saturn.
M:	
A:	oh, yeah, i'd do it, i'd use it for both. the nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
M:	i'd be nice,
A:	uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. and pylons and things.
M:	oh, i mean
A:	tight turns, hard acceleration. i've seen a lot of mustangs, uh, compete and it's interesting. they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class.
M:	i like
A:	yeah.
M:	do you know how to drive a car?
A:	uh, what are you thinking about buying?
M:	i think so.well, the cars are my main car.to me, the best car is the mustang.
A:	the legend. uh.
M:	i wonder what the name of the car would be?
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	a toyota, uh, a3?
A:	yeah, well, i was, i was actually in, uh, a lot of the b m w are produced in, uh, uh, stutgardt and, uh, and munich
M:	i was there.
A:	and i was, i was there this, uh, summer and, uh, i was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for b m w.
M:	and i was, uh, uh
A:	yeah.
M:	
A:	uh, oh, of course, of course they are. they want you to buy their car. yeah, there, it was, it was interesting. i was at, i, i also went to, uh, the porsche and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
M:	they
A:	yeah, the, uh, the b m w is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and, and then you go to porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
M:	that's,
A:	and no two of them are alike and
M:	i don'ts?
A:	so it's like completely opposed. i don't know, which do i like better, i think i like the porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
M:	they're both just the same
A:	unless, it's, it's a toy.
M:	that's a lot of money for a toy car.
A:	let's face it. yeah, yeah, but it, it, b m w good for that. what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?
M:	i love the idea of a car with a car.
A:	wow, yeah.
M:	you mean, like, you're driving a car?
A:	that's cool.
M:	it's a pretty big car, but it's not that much of a difference.
A:	yeah, that's good. i also, i was impressed by, uh, by the mercedes, too.
M:	i was. impressed by the ferrari
A:	i really, i really like the mercedes.
M:	that's what i like about them.they have a nice shape and all.
A:	the factory was nice and, and is it different for the, for the b m w?
M:	i am a big fan of the mercedes, but i think they're a little too.
A:	probably. right, i can imagine that.
M:	i mean, i can't
