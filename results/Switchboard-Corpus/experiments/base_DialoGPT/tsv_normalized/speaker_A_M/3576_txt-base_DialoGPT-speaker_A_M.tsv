A:	and we have about ten acres, and she tries to mow about half of it
M:	i see.
A:	well, yeah, it keeps, uh, well, it's doing real well, because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed
M:	how are you guys doing
A:	i mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
M:	well, i mean, you know, it was just a little bit of dirt
A:	and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course we water a little bit, that's just too much to water all at once, but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
M:	how do you?
A:	yeah, but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers. we have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.
M:	it '
A:	the rest of it is just like wild flowers
M:	what's the matter?
A:	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
M:	and the most beautiful yellow flowers.
A:	they're about, oh, i guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand
M:	oh my
A:	and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush.
M:	ummmmm... that's what i call a'bluebonnet '.
A:	yeah. well, my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing.
M:	i'm a lot of fun.
A:	uh, she enjoys mowing. i can't believe it.
M:	yay it.
A:	i mean, i hate it
M:	she laughs. i'm sure.
A:	right.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	we don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
M:	yeah, to
A:	uh-huh. yeah but, you know, we do everything together.
M:	...
A:	this, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, actually this fall, i was talking about, two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
M:	it's...
A:	and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting
M:	and, uh, we're planting
A:	and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line
M:	we're in, uh, the process.
A:	and i, uh, i think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
M:	i, uh, we're gonna build a wall, and i, uh...
A:	so.
M:	well, we can't stop them.
A:	on the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums, and we have morning glory
M:	so. where do you live?
A:	and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers, and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water
M:	but we have no water
A:	and we get hummingbirds come in the spring, you know, all summer long.
M:	uh, we have a lot of flowers, we just don't have the time to plant them
A:	and, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
M:	... and, we have all the rain we need, we can get the birds out.
A:	well, yeah, they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
M:	yeah, but you're in the kitchen.
A:	and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
M:	i guess, it's like a little food
A:	and we got a few, you know, we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
M:	the kids are the best feeders.
A:	but, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, well, we got asparagus, and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
M:	what are you, a fruit farmer?
A:	man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.
M:	i can't help but read this in the voice of the dude who's been trying to convince everyone he's a vampire.
A:	we just got our last tomatoes.
M:	so what do we do now?
A:	yeah.
M:	do you like tomatoes?
A:	well, these are accidental tomatos.
M:	they're not even tomatoes.
A:	well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes, of course you're going to lose some that way
M:	well, we're going on a hunt.
A:	and the seeds go right through them.
M:	no, they don't. the seeds go in the tomatoes.
A:	and wherever they pooped,
