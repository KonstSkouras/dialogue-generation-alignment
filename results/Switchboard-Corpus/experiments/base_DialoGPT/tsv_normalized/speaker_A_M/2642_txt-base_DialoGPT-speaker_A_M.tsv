M:	you have a business, this is there is business.
A:	and we only have one. we tore all the rest of them up.
M:	... you don't have a house.
A:	because i don't like credit cards for one thing, you know, i mean, they're okay, i guess, if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you,
M:	i
A:	but i don't like using them because i've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on,  chapter thirteen and stuff like that.
M:	they're all free
A:	because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it.
M:	why don't
A:	yeah, yeah, and it gives you a, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say, oh, well, i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it,  and it seems like ...
M:	i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i have it's for?
A:	right. are you married?
M:	i'll have to pass on that, but i'll be getting it back.
A:	oh, okay. well, i know that a lot of young people, you know, i, it took me a long time to get it through my child's head, i mean, that was her goal, you know, uh, got to have a credit card,
M:	i don't really have any of those.
A:	but now that she has one, she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit,
M:	what about it?
A:	but i think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, i used a credit card. and my husband's sister is the world's worst at, oh, well, i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit.
M:	.now.
A:	you know, and i'm, i'm thinking woman, wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you.  but ...
M:	don't!
A:	right, and people don't see that either.
M:	i'm not sure.
A:	right. the only one that we, we have that we kept was the discover card,
M:	right.
A:	and it pays you to use it.  i mean, if you pay your bill off right away,  if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it,
M:	yes.
A:	and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any, uh, interest. now it's, and people say, well, you know, i'm making money by using this credit card, but they don't realize that if they, i mean, it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest, i mean, you have to pay the interest, not pay it right off,
M:	lol
A:	that's going to take up what you would have made.
M:	no.
A:	so that's the only reason that we kept that, we debated for a long time plus they don't have that, um, charge on it, you know, like ...
M:	uuh, uh, charge, they pay, charge
A:	yeah.
M:	oh, so you're saying that it's a service charge?
A:	right. they don't have one of those. so, it, we decided that was it, you know, and, i mean, everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card. we have, we could have credit cards running down our ears.
M:	it's not like you have a creditcard.
A:	yes, yes. and then, i'll have, just like , uh, department stores. they'll call me up, you know, and i'll say, look, i don't want the credit card, well, we're just going to send it to you, you know, you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to. they'll send me any credit card, i tear it up.  i just can't see it.
M:	i
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	
A:	i know it, and you know what ...
M:	you can't, a', say, and do.
A:	what's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't, you know, we take the time to, you know, help my daughter, she's in college,
M:	the worst part is, we don't
A:	but it, this is her first credit card thing, well, when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal. look at this they sent me this money, you know. so then when i explained to her, look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest, and stuff , of course, she tore it up.  but a lot of parents would not take the time, you know, and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are, and, uh, you know, they may not even discuss it, they go out and cash their check thinking that, you know, they've got something, maybe they've won something.  you know, somebody sent them something free.
M:	
A:	and go out and spend it. and, um, it's just unreal. i mean, i don't like credit cards, i wish that they would come up with some other way to, you know, the only way you could use them is if you were, like on vacation. they would let you use it maybe once a year. you know, i mean, of course, i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but, um, i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen. she got, uh, i can't remember what she called it, it's some kind of, maybe it's sure or something like that, it's something, it's some weird name of a credit card,
M:	who
A:	and she is charging out of her mind already. and i'm going, you just got off. that's how you got on to it to start with, you know, what is the matter with this person,
M:	what
A:	but, um, it seems like people just, you know, they just think, well, i can just have anything i want. and i just don't see it like that. of course, i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover, that's what you have, but, um, maybe a lot of people don't see it like that, but i can't stand owing. i mean, i cannot fully tolerate to owe something like, you know, i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that. but, um, i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout. but, that's just the way i feel about it.
M:	!
A:	right.  yeah.
M:	this.that
A:	oh, yeah. i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that. but, um, i guess it's because i'm older, i mean, i'm not real old but i am older and, um, you know, i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything. i guess it was because, well, i had everything when i was at home but i, i don't know why i didn't.
M:	
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i
A:	yeah.
M:	we,
A:	huh.
M:	that is the joke
A:	yeah, well, it didn't hurt you, did it, to, i mean, you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything, did you?
M:	i have a feeling that i'm not the only one who's mad at the fact that i got a new phone and it's been 4 years.
A:	yeah, well, you learned then, right?
M:	i, i, you, you' read.
A:	yeah.
M:	you.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you can't.
