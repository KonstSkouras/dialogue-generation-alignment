M:	i go
A:	i got a friend who goes there by the way i want to talk to you about that afterward okay.
M:	i am...
A:	yeah. yeah. was a a it's more or less a suburban school system?
M:	yeah it's the school not so school.
A:	yes. that that was true for mine too. uh although i i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it.  you know i  think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education.
M:	you are in in?
A:	and uh  you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn.
M:	yeah to
A:	i mean  know
M:	well you know
A:	yeah that's true. but but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  which it i mean it sounds like uh
M:	you know.
A:	now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
M:	you
A:	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read. uh and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something.
M:	
A:	but these people obviously weren't.
M:	you could be.not.not.
A:	yeah.
M:	well that's read.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	i'm a girl.
A:	yeah. and i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. i mean i don't i think you know people just
M:	it's the whole point of the article.
A:	yeah. and again i don't i mean got know the you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school.  you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
M:	
A:	i think that'd be an interesting experience. but uh i haven't done that
M:	i.
A:	but i do i do think that uh i mean public education in general i think can work. and i think it's a good thing.
M:	no i can.
A:	yeah.
M:	because uh that's the only thing that
A:	yes.
M:	and you mean like in this subreddit?
A:	yeah. yeah. i mean i don't i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in. mean
M:	it's not that bad. it's just that you know you're not the best at this.
A:	yeah.
M:	but you could've done much much better.
A:	yeah. i mean and and in the once you junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. well no i guess it in junior high it was still three. then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects. uh which
M:	that.
A:	i mean actually i think that works pretty well. and that that makes
