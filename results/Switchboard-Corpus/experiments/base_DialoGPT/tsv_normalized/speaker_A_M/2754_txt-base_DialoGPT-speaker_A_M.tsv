M:	
A:	uh, i believe in it, too
M:	u
A:	i'm catholic and we're not supposed to, but, uh, i feel that it, like you, you know, on the premeditated murders i feel if you're, you know, i mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
M:	uhhh, i'm catholic, and i can say that i'm not.
A:	but, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know, they really didn't do it. well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.
M:	not
A:	there's always that chance, i don't know, but, i would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
M:	i.
A:	you know what i'm saying? like,
M:	i'm
A:	yeah.
M:	it's not like you could find evidence of him being a suspect or anything
A:	so, uh, i,
M:	what?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think i know what you're talking about.
A:	exactly. uh, i'm not sure about pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. for some reason i was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it.
M:	18
A:	i don't, do you know if virginia has it?
M:	that's not how it works
A:	uh-huh.
M:	no, huhuhuhuhuuhuh
A:	i know florida has it.
M:	but... florida.
A:	uh-huh.  yeah.
M:	uhhh. i don't think so.
A:	uh, you know,
M:	they have a crime problems
A:	yeah. but it's funny that, uh, i mean, like, you know, like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania. i'm not even sure of that, but for some reason i think that, you know, it was something like that. and, it surprised, and even florida, i know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
M:	...
A:	yeah, but, you, you think that, i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
M:	that, and,,
A:	yeah.
M:	that,.
A:	everyone would appeal.  that's true, too.
M:	except, you know, the, uh, appeals
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	i think it would be a good idea to have the supreme courts review the cases of the supreme courts and the supreme court of appeals.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	not really, the supreme court doesn't appeal the appeal.
A:	yeah, uh-huh.
M:	um, um, um...
A:	and then they get out.
M:	the first thing i thought of was that they are in the middle of a street.
A:	yeah, they get out in three years on probation,
M:	i wonder how many of them are going to be in jail for the next three years.
A:	and they do it again, you know.
M:	they get out
A:	it's like a slap on the fingers for them.
M:	why?
A:	i don't, i don't, i don't, i think that it should be, i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then i think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. but, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
M:	
A:	yeah.
M:	oh, so?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, it's a lot easier to get in prison than it is to get out.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	yea. yeah.
A:	i think some of them would rather be in jail
M:	so you're saying that some of the guys in prison are like the inmates?
A:	yeah. they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
M:	you know, they probably don't have a lot of money.
A:	i don't know, uh, i was just going to say something, i forgot what it was. oh, i don't even remember what it was now.
M:	what's your point?
A:	in clarion. well, i live in butler, but i'm at i'm at college. i'm at clarion university.
M:	where do you go to school?
A:	yeah
M:	yeah, i'm not really sure what that means.
A:	uh-huh. see, yeah, okay, well, see, i'm, i'm in kind, i'm in kind, okay, uh, we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
M:	i, er, say, mostly,
A:	yeah, and that would be pushing it. so, i mean this is definitely a college town. uh, we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any. uh,
M:	uuh.
A:	north of pittsburgh, pennsylvania.
M:	i mean, what state?
A:	oh, i've never heard of polk but,
M:	polk, pa.
A:	oh, i never heard of that.
M:	i think it's polk institute of technology
A:	it might have a new name.
M:	oh, i've heard of it.
A:	yeah, yeah.
M:	oh, i'm sorry, i thought you were in the midwest
A:	we're probably about an hour away from sharon.
M:	that's pretty far away from where i live.
A:	uh-huh. uh, so, i, most of the kids here, i, you know, like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it, but then after i would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah, you know, you know.
M:	hehehe, yeah.
A:	yeah. you know, i think people can be persuaded one way or another. i've never seriously ran into someone, i mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life. uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
M:	i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	.
A:	yeah uh-huh.
M:	yeah, you.
A:	yeah,
M:	yeah, i'm.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah. that's something, you know but, uh, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.
M:	...
A:	so i don't think that they deserve anything less
M:	well, they don't have a lot less than they have a ton of, they're a ton's a ton, a ton
A:	it's just, i don't, i don't know, i just
M:	i don't like you
A:	uh-huh, and that costs money, yeah.
M:	they're not getting anything for them.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not sure if you're saying we can do it, but we can
A:	yeah.
M:	well, uh, uh.
