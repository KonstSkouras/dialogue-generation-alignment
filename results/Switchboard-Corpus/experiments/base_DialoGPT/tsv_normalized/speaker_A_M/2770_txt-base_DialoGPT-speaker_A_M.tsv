A:	right, as a matter of fact, i was thinking that same thing, unconditional love. they just give it, and don't expect too much.
M:	i don't think so.
A:	anyway, do you have a pet?
M:	yeah, i know.
A:	oh! like a
M:	she had a pet, and she's now in a relationship.
A:	oh, i'm so sorry. but that's good that you're going to get another one.
M:	i just had a kitten.
A:	i know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that i know, that have pets. but they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
M:	that,
A:	yeah, an, and my, my kids,
M:	food.
A:	um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything i think
M:	i want a lot of course.
A:	but, um, i don't know do you like, i guess your cat was an indoor cat.
M:	he was never in my house, but i do like the cat.
A:	it kind of traveled around travel .
M:	you're a cat?
A:	yeah, when i had a cocker spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog and, uh, i think i liked that better.
M:	did you know the dog was trained?
A:	yeah, that's true.
M:	yes, it's
A:	yeah, that's true. take them for walks, right. yeah, i see all the people on, on sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and i, i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, i'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe,
M:	no.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. so, i
M:	that's
A:	oh, that's exciting. yeah.
M:	so
A:	yeah, i think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
M:	it'shoot.
A:	that, that kind of gripes on me some, but, but i don't know.
M:	it's the same reason you have a pet.
A:	more and more people are,  right, right.
M:	...
A:	but, uh,
M:	and, uh, i think, you know, and
A:	i think that's really true.
M:	the best part is when you realize it's true.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	yeah, exactly.
M:	you're talking about the kittens, right?
A:	exactly. i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too, and, and that's good too.
M:	it's still a lot better than the community.
A:	well, i think that's all i have to say.
M:	it's fine.thanks for the talk though
A:	okay, have a good night.   all right, bye-bye.
M:	i think it was the same.
