M:	ugh the parents of kids who are going to school tomorrow.
A:	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
M:	you are not disciplined.
A:	you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
M:	i'm not a child i'm a human being.
A:	yeah that's right  that's right.
M:	i know that's why i said i was a little bit scared.
A:	my my daughter's in the um fourth grade
M:	it's a girl
A:	and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom where the teacher cannot teach
M:	uhhh and uh teacher who's the teacher?
A:	and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with.
M:	uhhh uh um yeah uh...
A:	uh-huh. well they they just don't do that any more.
M:	i was told that they are uh the teachers.
A:	but the school system's afraid of getting sued and um all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that.
M:	we are.
A:	and i also believe we don't even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
M:	we don't that's why.
A:	and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
M:	it's a joke
A:	yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
M:	...
A:	you know i don't know your feelings toward that. i guess we shouldn't get into that but um and what else um i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
M:	it's
A:	i have heard stories uh from other parents that i know of their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
M:	what
A:	oh yeah
M:	that's right.
A:	i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high high school teachers
M:	i'm sorry.
A:	and you know to be be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
M:	that's why i keep a high school teacher's number.
A:	um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system. i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
M:	... um... um... you know um...
A:	uh-huh so.
M:	so.what do you think?
A:	yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
M:	i am not really interested in the subject matter.
A:	yeah. okay well i guess um we can discontinue our call now.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	it was a joy in talking with you.
M:	i'm fine.
A:	okay thanks.
