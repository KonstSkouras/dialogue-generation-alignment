M:	so what do you think of the relationship between rome and new york?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	new york
A:	uh-huh.  yes.
M:	yes.it.is.that
A:	yeah i uh i ethically don't like the idea but or i should say morally i don't like the idea but uh social and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea in certain crimes.
M:	... uh yes?
A:	uh-huh.   uh-huh.   right any   on the street no i know.  uh-huh.  yeah and texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from from killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
M:	...what
A:	and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in you know i mean you think why they say it's because you're over crowd it's over crowded and you think how is is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
M:	::.that.!
A:	i know.
M:	it
A:	and then
M:	it is the first time
A:	i don't know how americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in austin texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an f b i check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
M:	
A:	is it that's good.
M:	you can shoot through
A:	say that good  i think that's like the state of virginia yeah that's great.
M:	i think i think about that and
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i uh i'm not uh...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i know because uh i know.
A:	uh-huh.   right they're no  the cattiness behind right yeah
M:	er
A:	i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in florida in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case
M:	i
A:	and how they just well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety
M:	the year before?
A:	and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you you know this is nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a i might be too cold too but they flip a switch
M:	i
A:	i don't know
M:	i have no idea what i'm talking
A:	i mean
M:	that's like your opinion man.
A:	so many times.
M:	and so many times
A:	yeah.
M:	oh.
A:	yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one  you know
M:	i know.
A:	you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
M:	wait so they found out about it?
A:	and they buried her alive
M:	and the murder
A:	and peter strauss had played the lead role and the man and and at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh that's nice.
M:	it's good
A:	i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh definite  you know lasting
M:	i've never heard that before. i'll have to check it out.
A:	right in that particular instance uh but i but i don't but i know it's on a and all and be all
M:	ahaaaaaaayyyy.
A:	that's the problem i have with it in texas they think it's and all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something or gas somebody uh that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime  ridden
M:	
A:	and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in minneapolis saint paul uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is  even suburban no matter where you are
M:	now
A:	and how you're in  rome new york
M:	you.
A:	is that and and is that like near albany or syracuse
M:	so is that a question?
A:	what what type of area is that
M:	i live in the middle of nowhere uh and uh i'm not even uh
A:	is that in term
M:	i'm in the area
A:	uh-huh.  uh-huh.
M:	i don't know what's going on in this picture but it's hilarious
A:	sure.
M:	i know it's a joke but it's still funny
A:	how would  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and  and things that would
M:	they do.
A:	not too bad.  yeah.   uh-huh.
M:	how bad?
A:	not the harsh criminality  that you find in
M:	i can't. i can't be bothered to
A:	yeah now dallas is a i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great  uh  on some days uh it's uh i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and  deed for deed that  that does something uh
M:	
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over  crowded
M:	money is their money money.
A:	i mean that's that's just not a cop out uh and i just you know i'm originally from pennsylvania which i think is basically like new york these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there.
M:	you're like but
A:	uh-huh.  yeah and i'm from pittsburgh so  oh well we'll forgive each other
M:	you you uhhhh...
A:	uh because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty  years
M:	uu '
A:	but uh
M:	it's ok we can live in pittsburgh
A:	there you go i don't know that's a different subject  altogether
M:	i live in the west part the east is like i think.
A:	but uh i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime. i think everyone would you and i think are honest and candid because we could do it on in this  vehicle uh
M:	i'm not sure i'm understanding the question
A:	but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out  i think every human does i think they'd say yeah
M:	i think everyone here would feel the same if they touched
A:	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know
M:	i think it's okay if you do it
A:	uh
M:	no i am not
A:	uh-huh.   yeah i just  don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and uh rape rapist getting their hand  just slapped you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session  you know all these uh intangible things
M:	
A:	and you're thinking oh you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting uh
M:	
A:	but i don't know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either i just
M:	you
A:	uh-huh.  is it uh how about the injection
M:	i don't have any ideas i can you think of u do u
A:	is that suppose to be.
M:	i'm sorry
A:	yeah. i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh it's more that don't have it
M:	it's just the state of being isn't it?
A:	isn't that correct.
M:	the only thing that is a problem is the us.
A:	uh-huh.   uh-huh.
M:	what? you can't tell me what to do i don't know what to say.
A:	yeah i don't know if they've they did something about i'm not sure if texas minnesota i they didn't they didn't they were well did they have it they were against it uh texas as i said has it but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not  if they've done it in the last
M:	you.
