A:	right. in my my uh father's family we get together every year at a different location either dallas or oklahoma city. they had chosen santa barbara california for this summer and and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the texas oklahoma area.
M:	?
A:	and uh so they cancelled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter that circulates
M:	sends
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order. and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you do not feel like i do not know anything about this person. you have read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
M:	then
A:	so you are kind of half way acquainted that way.
M:	no.
A:	and that that's been a that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other i think.
M:	you're we've been we.
A:	we tried to start that in my husband's family. his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. i sent it on to the next one
M:	i'm sorry
A:	and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in scottsdale arizona for that family.
M:	you can't
A:	we are real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left. and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.
