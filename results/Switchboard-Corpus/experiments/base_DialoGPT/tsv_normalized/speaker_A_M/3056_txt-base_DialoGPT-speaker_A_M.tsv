M:	i'm reading a book uh about the first world war uh
A:	who wrote that?
M:	i think that's the first time i've read a book i haven't read in a while.
A:	huh.
M:	...
A:	i see.
M:	
A:	well that is interesting. right.
M:	no.
A:	that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
M:	he's talking about the book.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't think it's real.
A:	and they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
M:	they haven't even made a film of it.
A:	yeah.
M:	have you seen the movie?
A:	uh. explained  *listen; could be br
M:	
A:	supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
M:	
A:	yeah.
M:	the'n' we.not.they.not.
A:	yeah. on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the amelia earhart story whatever happened with her?
M:	
A:	i i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh 
M:	i.
A:	i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
M:	it's a bit of a shame i think she's still alive.
A:	well whatever this is one aspect of it.
M:	oh okay.
A:	of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things.
M:	i don't know.
A:	that is for sure.
M:	i like it.
A:	yeah.
M:	wait what?
A:	right. well i i guess i just have not read i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished. if it's that good
M:	yeah i read.
A:	and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's and that was presumed innocent.
M:	it was
A:	and i just really really liked the way he writes. it's just incredible.
M:	i like it.
A:	yeah.
M:	did you read it?
A:	uh.
M:	i read that.
A:	that was good i think. and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity uh
M:	you.
A:	bon  yeah.
M:	you're the best.
A:	uh. yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book.
M:	there is no way you read that you should be ashamed.
A:	and. yeah.
M:	he was in the movie
A:	oh the movie was a joke compared to i mean because tom wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing uh society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
M:	i think he's talking about the movie.
A:	and and so it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
M:	i'm not really sure what you're saying.
A:	and anyway we are not talking about that but uh gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that. just to tell me what to do with my garden and uh and uh
M:	i do.
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm reading
A:	like what is a book on your list you know i have a list too and i have never gotten to it
M:	you.
A:	oh.
