A:	uh, very good.
M:	i do. i don't, uh, exercise.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	uhm.
A:	yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. i know, my son is a biker and he, he's done the whole canal, i think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
M:	i love it
A:	and so, but that somehow takes, organization. for me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, i can, i can do some of my reading,
M:	uhh, i'm not sure, but it looks nice
A:	um, but,
M:	... and so, you can.
A:	no, i live in maryland.
M:	you're in the district, right?
A:	right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
M:	you have a lot of work to do in the area.
A:	i mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops so i do. now, i think, um, basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?
M:	it's just a bit of fun
A:	uh-huh, right. i think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.
M:	...
A:	oh, well, that's great, that's great.
M:	and.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i just,
A:	right. and actually in, in summer i like to swim. we don't have facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when i go home from work at the end of the day, if i go up for an hour in the pool, i'm much, much more awake, i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
M:	
A:	so.
M:	i dont think so.
A:	no, i'm not.
M:	do you?
A:	no.
M:	are you in the us?
A:	oh, really.
M:	not sure why you're getting downvoted, i have no idea.
A:	no, i don't know that. but, i, i must say, that, um, when, when i did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.
M:	what, you don't have a proper accent?
A:	and it's probably because i, i, i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california, and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then i've been abroad a lot,
M:	you, i, i speak english,
A:	in santa barbara.
M:	where
A:	oh, i see. uh-huh. well, very good, i think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits
M:	i'm in
A:	and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
M:	yes, i'm a student.
A:	oh, okay.
M:	he was talking to me.
A:	bye-bye.
