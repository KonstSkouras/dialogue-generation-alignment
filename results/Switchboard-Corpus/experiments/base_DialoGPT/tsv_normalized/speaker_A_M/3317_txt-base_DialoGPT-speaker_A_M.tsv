M:	what's the rent?

M:	hmmm. i don't know.
A:	oh really? uh-huh.
M:	we bought it and it's the best thing we've ever done.
A:	uh-huh. well i bet you uh-huh.
M:	uuhh uh uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh uh uh... uh huh.
A:	well that sounds interesting. i bet he's enjoyed having it that way
M:	he's in his garage
A:	because kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.
M:	why not?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well you could build it yourself.
A:	well then most of them don't have a three car garage.
M:	some of the cars have a 3 car garage.
A:	they're kind of rare.
M:	you've never seen a 3 car garage?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you could put a 3 car garage into the garage.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	well there is a garage there.
A:	uh-huh. well that my we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything.
M:	i'm so sorry
A:	now mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that.
M:	your wife is a big
A:	but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things.
M:	and he's always busy.
A:	it really is.
M:	well mine is still there.
A:	because you know they have a lot of things of their own and i you know i wouldn't mind having and i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
M:	you know the whole?
A:	but i someone i don't know it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
M:	i don't think it was.
A:	so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would.
M:	i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what are you doing?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm going to do that.
A:	uh-huh. well i still all three of my daughters are married but i don't know i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things you know.
M:	uhh... well i don't.
A:	and we've got grandchildren now so when they come they have to have a place.
M:	oh. uh... i guess that makes sense.
A:	that's right you sure don't. at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice.
M:	i'm sorry for being a little rude.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not a girl but i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	what's going on?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	... why is he in a relationship?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	ugh uh.
A:	well i don't blame you for that.
M:	i just had to be told.
A:	well i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons.
M:	i'm sure i'll find someone to date.
A:	and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
M:	he nods and smiles well i am a girl.
A:	and uh i enjoy them coming but for short doses
M:	i love them but they are too short for me
A:	it feels after they've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything.
M:	that's a long time to wait for them to explore the house.
A:	but they're fun.
M:	they're not.
A:	well i just watch them.
M:	do you watch the videos?
A:	i i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with them. i try to teach them not to get into things.
M:	you can watch them but they don't like it.
A:	i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes. at least my daughters have. they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. so it's worked pretty well. there's i don't really think anything's been broken. every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know.
M:	
A:	but all in all they mind pretty well. but i guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have? here i'm getting off the subject.
M:	no
