M:	you can't. it's the best.
A:	on a b c?
M:	i think it was on the last thursday night.
A:	oh, oh, yeah, well, um, um, it may be that, um, it was recently replaced, by actually by, um, by what may be my favorite t v show of, because sort of, uh, um, twin peaks.
M:	that's not it, that's just a reference to the episode.
A:	yeah, so, twin peaks, um, what happened was, i think, twin peaks, um, went, went off, they moved to a saturday night for a while. and then put, and then put something, i guess, gabriel's fire on it, and at thursday nights, and then they moved, um, no, gabriel's fire was on c b s, i think, i, i take that back. i'm not sure, but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when peaks was back in that time slot as well. so, i don't know.
M:	
A:	no, i have no idea. i don't think, i don't think that was on a b c, anyway i don't know what happened to it though.
M:	i.
A:	um, it's hard to say i'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan, and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on. i'm, i'm, half the time i'm a t v addict and the other half the time i just ignore it it's really bad. yeah, there's some new shows that i sort of like, um, have you seen this shannon field show or, uh, it's about a lawyer, it's one of these lawyer shows, you know, they seem to be popular these days. and there's a lot of those blair shows floating around.
M:	yes
A:	yeah.
M:	
A:	i just like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago, um, and it and, that, that's a interesting one. i, i, i like that, because there's, there are , i've noticed that every, every major station now has their own law show. there's l a law, and there's, um, equal justice, some other one, law and order or something. do you like the law shows or,
M:	
A:	that, that makes logic ,
M:	that, and you, and, and...
A:	also saves a lot of time with commercials.
M:	i mean you.
A:	oh, i have. i've, i've, i watched that late, um, i guess it's on late saturday nights or something,
M:	i have. it's just that it's not on tv.
A:	that's entering the day as well.
M:	i think it's going to be on in the middle of the night.
A:	have you, have, have you seen this often?
M:	have, have you?
A:	oh, really?
M:	you tape it
A:	yeah.
M:	i'm gonna say it
A:	really? i,
M:	it's the only song i have in my playlist, it's a little sad.
A:	that don't, it , it, it seems like, i mean, if wrestling is prime time, professional wrestling, it seems like it's just, just, just like pros in a wrestling to me, i don't, i don't see any difference though,
M:	i don't,
A:	i, i don't understand it, they consider it violent. i have so ever , i have seen it on, where we are , i live in, uh , rochester, new york, and i think a,
M:	what do you not
A:	yes.
M:	you think this is the first time i've seen this?
A:	where are you?
M:	you don't know that?
A:	you're, uh, everybody i speak to is in texas, oh, oh, yeah, but i'm, i'm in new york and, uh, we seem, we seem to have, um, i think the american gladiators is on sunday afternoons actually around here as well, sometimes.
M:	it's sunday morning in new england.
A:	i think it's been on, i think i've seen it during the day.
M:	i've seen the news, but i've never seen it in the middle of the day.
A:	definitely seen it on, on, during the day down there , and i don't think it's a very violent show, i think it's funny. i think it's a real good concept, i think it's something completely new.
M:	not ahem
A:	i think so, i think because people sort of get through, you know, um, i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the, as well as, you know, some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth.
M:	you
A:	well, don't they take people who have some sort of, um, big abilities like and, and at least they used to when it, when it, the first ones i saw they had, um, a man on who was, uh, he played college football and almost went pro, and they had a, a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the, uh, she was in the junior olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very, very big sports backgrounds. to have they, leaned away from that sort of,
M:	what.lol
A:	oh, that's how they do it.
M:	i
A:	really?
M:	so.
A:	yeah, okay, i just thought they had some,
M:	they're just making a joke.
A:	yeah, i thought they had some sort of, i mean, i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not, that's great.
M:	they're pretty good.
A:	but, maybe i'll try it one day. i'll get on there one day and see if i can, uh, um, what, what do they win, they, they win money i think, don't they?
M:	not much, but they have some
A:	really?
M:	there's a lot of people who have a lot more money than i do.
A:	wow. all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour.
M:	how much?
A:	one little ball here and there, yeah, and this guy's beating you up, so, i don't know the beating up part. i, i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt.
M:	i think he was just making a joke.
A:	they look like, yeah, they seem like a tennis ball but it almost doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah, the best i, i don't think i could, i, i could handle those tennis balls. so, what else to you tape besides american at, there anything else?
M:	this
A:	huh?
M:	we're
A:	okay.
M:	i'm gonna tape my fingers to my nails, i'm gonna do it.
A:	oh, okay.
M:	there's no reason to be scared.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	hm? huh?
A:	but, i'm sure that's fun.
M:	... i'm a girl.
A:	uh-huh. oh, okay, well, they seem to be on later,
M:	that's not really the case, i've never had a case in which the defendant was not involved.
A:	all, always right, right before the news is when i catch them. i, i tend to, if nothing else is in the town television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news, and or, or nightline or something, just sort of get a good, you know, a good, a good think for the day.
M:	uhm.
A:	yes. when is yours on?
M:	is your news on?
A:	oh, gosh, well, i'm sorry i interrupted, um,
M:	i was just kidding.
A:	yeah, ours is on,
M:	we are all in the same place, right?
A:	actually it, ours is on at eleven it, it's, um, eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here in new york. um, i think they they do that, i think they put things on at, um, eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock, um, california time, like in california but in the middle they sort of, um, like central time or mountain time they, they push things back. so, i was actually, actually i'm not sure , i was in, i was in iowa awhile ago, and noticed that everything was an hour earlier, so, does your prime time start at seven o'clock?
M:	
A:	wait, no, no,
M:	i...
A:	not, not even the news but do they have like, um, do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth, start at seven o'clock? you, so, like, you know, the regular television shows that are, that are very popular, do they start at, seven or, or at eight?
M:	
A:	right, because that would the eight o'clock here.
M:	it's the show.
A:	yeah, that, that would all start at, at, um, that would all start at, at eight o'clock here, that wouldn't start at seven. we have, um, at seven o'clock we just have, um, the, they'll play, you know, they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty, and then something else from seven thirty to eight
M:	
A:	and ours start at, at, at, at eight and end at eleven, that's why we . i, i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten.
M:	how do we could'a, and, i,
A:	oh, that's great.
M:	that's
A:	oh, all the time. do you watch cheers
M:	what is it?
A:	it's at, that was actually a big dilemma for me now because, um, cheers, cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time,
