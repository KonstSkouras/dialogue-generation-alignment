A:	uh-huh.
M:	i can't help but feel like this is an ad for a breed.
A:	oh, she's about four. she's not completely pure. we got her from the, uh, humane society when she was a puppy. she looks like a she looks just like a golden retriever, but she's a little bit smaller. she's like fifty-five pounds.

M:	she's not really in any danger.
A:	but, but we love her anyway. she's just a lot of company to us. we didn't, we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer, but up until then, she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun.

M:	...
A:	and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down. and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling and that, was mine.
