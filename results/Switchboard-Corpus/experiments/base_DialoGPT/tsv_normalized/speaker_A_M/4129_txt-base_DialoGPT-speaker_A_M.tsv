M:	not.
A:	yes. right that would be the intent of it.
M:	no.
A:	well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many  appeals.
M:	i mean i'm sure it would but i think
A:	yeah if if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely possibly capital punishment
M:	i think it's a little bit more complicated than that.

A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah. but i think it would be a lot easier to do if we could just do it for the other ones.
A:	um that's probably true but i guess there's other factors that
M:	we'd be better off if we had the money to buy the kids.
A:	but pumping more money into the school system is a good thing

M:	i've been in the same boat as you.i'm just going to have to live with it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not quite sure
A:	i'm sure it is yeah.
M:	but it's cheaper to send the kid
A:	um yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
M:	if the solution to any of these problems is to give the death penalty then it's not going to work.
A:	but
M:	and that's why i don'think it's going to fix anything
A:	uh
