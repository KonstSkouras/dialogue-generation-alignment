M:	i'm sorry to hear that.
A:	and i spend most of my time carpooling
M:	and we have a daughter
A:	the story of my life
M:	i have no idea what that story is about.
A:	my kids are involved in sports. my daughter has played basketball for six years and my son plays football. i my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
M:	i have a rule that my daughter can't be involved in any sports. i have to get her out of the house
A:	yes. i know i know. the insurance.
M:	it.uh uh
A:	yes. my son is in both band and scouts too.
M:	you
A:	oh gee.
M:	you.the.what.
A:	right.
M:	it's not really you know fun
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know what? we can.
A:	yeah.
M:	uhhh uh
A:	we found this oriental tile game called mah-jongg .
M:	i would have guessed a game called mahjongg
A:	have you?
M:	i've heard that.
A:	well it's really fun. um one of my neighbors moved here from memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
M:	i have never played it but i've been meaning to
A:	and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play and they both enjoy it. so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad.
M:	i don't know how you got to play this game.
A:	so uh we play that a lot of them and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
M:	
A:	we have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips.
M:	you have family?
A:	so that and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
M:	i have family in the state of texas.
A:	my daughter and and i hate camping so we go shopping. so that just kind of works out real well.
M:	i like camping. i don't go to the campsite.
A:	and um i'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together.
M:	well yeah.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	are you just gonna go and visit the museum?
A:	so that gives us special time together too.
M:	i'm a kid.
A:	and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so i can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too  so.
M:	it's not like she's a teacher. she's just a student.
A:	yep.
M:	are you a teacher?
A:	yeah.
M:	so? it's a little different.
A:	right.
M:	it's
A:	my husband has taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does.
M:	you i but you you?
A:	so we just say he travels a lot. so that kind of covers it.
M:	he's a professor.
A:	yes. yeah.
M:	you know i don't really know the guy's personality. he's a pretty nice guy but i don'know what it is.
A:	he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
M:	he said he's going to do it.
A:	yes.
M:	so... he's been here for nine months?
A:	so those are the real killers. if he's just gone
M:	yes.
A:	he's gone three weeks right now and that's that's mild compare to the big ones
M:	he's gone.
A:	so we just you know. i just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done. and something major always needs to be done.
M:	i'm in the same boat.
A:	so you just have to to handle it until he gets home
M:	well yeah.
A:	and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
