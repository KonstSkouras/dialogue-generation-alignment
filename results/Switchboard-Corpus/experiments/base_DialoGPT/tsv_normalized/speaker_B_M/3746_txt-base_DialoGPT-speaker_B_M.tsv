B:	well we live uh pretty close to the mesquite golf course.
M:	yeah uh what's up?
B:	so we will play either out there or at firewheel. that is usually where we play but i have played you know different courses in in the dallas area.
M:	i've been playing in the mesothelioma.
B:	uh both
M:	do we have a team?
B:	not at the same time.
M:	are you guys on the same course?
B:	no sometimes we ride and sometimes uh we pull we like to to uh a lot of the times just walk uh for the exercise.  but
M:	when you say you're a big guy do you mean you walk or do you walk and do it?
B:	i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it is cause i don't get as tired
M:	i'm not sure but it's probably because i ride a cart and i'm not as good as you.
B:	yeah.
M:	are you riding?
B:	i know and that makes me so mad you know it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
M:	you can only get out in the first 2 rounds.
B:	yeah.
M:	they are doing a lot of damage to it.
B:	right.
M:	so the reason you don't want to be there is because of the cart?
B:	right. well the reason why we play over there is because its where since we are a garland resident they gave us a special deal where you can get uh ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars yeah a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.
M:	... so... are you saying the turf is covered?
B:	so that is why we you know play over there cause we have got our card
M:	i live in a place where we can play over here.
B:	oh do you? so you live in garland then.
M:	yeah we have a card.
B:	okay well we are in south garland but yeah next time you go uh you know check into it they have uh it is just like uh a bus card and they just punch it. you know it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you.
M:	
B:	oh okay.
M:	i have you played?
B:	you must have a a son.
M:	i don't?
B:	oh okay.
M:	yeah i'm pretty active in the boy scout age.
B:	yeah.
M:	so camping and canoe?
B:	oh well that sounds like fun too
M:	no. not really.
B:	uh-huh. well you need to uh teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
M:	i'm gonna have to try this. i don't have any friends that play golf.
B:	oh yeah. well you can teach them
M:	i'm a freshman.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you don't have to be a little kid to understand
B:	right right. uh-huh.
M:	i'm gonna say it's not.
B:	uh-huh. right. right.
M:	i like to think that we've had a group of golf courses in the past that have been completely unenforceable.
B:	right. yeah i know what you mean
M:	i'm sure i could find something else to say about it
B:	uh-huh.
M:	well uhuh. i don't wanna play strikeout.
B:	oh yeah. it it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.
M:	i see.
B:	well flower gardens. i like to have matter of fact this past weekend i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. so those ought to be coming up around spring time
M:	what are you doing?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	are you ready?
B:	right.
M:	they have a flower garden
B:	oh they do great. i put mine in probably in november.
M:	they're blooming right now.
B:	yeah i think it was november and i don't do anything to mine water them or anything and they just they do really good and i even had uh i guess it was last year or the year before i had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later. i didn't do anything to them so they are uh they are good to plant in the winter time. they last for a long time then. so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.
M:	
B:	no they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot but they make it through probably winter and spring. so
M:	
B:	yeah i have got some of those too cause i love flowers
M:	i
B:	yeah. and i do i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go
