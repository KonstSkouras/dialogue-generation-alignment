B:	how many square feet do you have?
M:	, all,
B:	four bedrooms?
M:	there's a lot of houses in the neighborhood
B:	five bedrooms. uh-huh.
M:	5 bedrooms?
B:	i made a, i made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a, uh, what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,
M:	that's what i said.
B:	when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house
M:	when, when
B:	so that,
M:	i, uh, i, uh... i made the fourth bedroom
B:	how many stories? just one?
M:	we're not too worried about that.
B:	how are they built?
M:	the whole house.
B:	yeah. i've heard that, i've heard the construction is pretty good on fox and jacobs.
M:	they are the only ones that have been built.
B:	but i mean it doesn't give you trouble?
M:	not in the sense that you're gonna have to get a whole bunch of stuff.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you mean the construction on fox amp jacobs?
B:	no cracked slab or anything like that?
M:	i have the same problem, and i just can't get the game to run.
B:	all right.
M:	not at all.
B:	and is it, um, a natural gas and,
M:	the question is, how?
B:	you know what i miss though? basements.
M:	he shrugs. i've been lucky.
B:	i i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas.
M:	it's a shame they didn't have any.
B:	so you,
M:	i have, i'm just saying that's what i've seen a lot.
B:	can you stand up in it?
M:	my mom has a house in my house. i don't know if i could stand in it.
B:	so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
M:	i don't know, it's probably a lot louder than it sounds.
B:	ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.
M:	my attic is a lot smaller than my house.
B:	so, five bedrooms and two living, two family
M:	we do, but we don't have a roof.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you'll be fine.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhhhh. what's the difference between the two?
B:	isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.
M:	the only thing i can think of is the
B:	you
M:	you are correct.
B:	right. some people, i mean, families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.
M:	some people, we call it a family.
B:	i mean might as well not even heat and cool it.
M:	we arent even going to get to that.
B:	strange.
M:	well, we do have a house.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you are now breathing manually.
B:	right, right. uh-huh.
M:	i'm not going to tell you how to feel.
B:	so you've been fairly happy with it. how long have you been in it?
M:	i don't know.
B:	wow. boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time
M:	how long have we been in this area?
B:	we've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.
M:	you've been in the neighborhood for eighteen years?
B:	and we, the, the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam.
M:	what about the tower?
B:	yours is a slab i assume.
M:	well, it's a slab.
B:	yeah, ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab.
M:	is it slab?
B:	i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
M:	do you have any experience with slab building?
B:	but that's because it's so old.
M:	my house is slab.
B:	it's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build like that, and, uh,
M:	that's pretty cool.
B:	i know, he's not a handy, right?
M:	that's not how that works
B:	i, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it
M:	i have a lot of problems with it.
B:	and, uh, i've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
M:	well, that's why you get good at making a joke, isn't it?
B:	right. my dad is actually, uh,
