B:	oh boy.
M:	i am the child of the child.
B:	yeah.
M:	i see.
B:	are you? where are a student?
M:	good. i'm glad you're okay.
B:	no kidding.
M:	awww. you should go to school for this.
B:	i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.
M:	it's an old meme.
B:	yeah uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two?
M:	well you know that's why i was asking.
B:	yeah.
M:	you're in school?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	okay yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	so i'm assuming it'll be a four to five hour week?
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	you'rein.
B:	well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
M:	we're they're'a.
B:	and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
M:	we got it.
B:	and uh that's more important than anything else. we could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility.
M:	we could have
B:	uh she goes to a home. this is a uh a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives.
M:	what are you uh going to do uh...
B:	they've been here probably thirty forty years.
M:	yeah uh uh.
B:	they've got three daughters. uh and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
M:	that's odd.
B:	and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
M:	uhhh. yeah.
B:	so it's a good experience.
M:	i think it's pretty fun
B:	i if it's good i think it's very good for the child.
M:	what about a nice and warm place?
B:	and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it. she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
M:	it's a loving home i think she'll do fine.
B:	but uh we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace. i don't know what it's like around uh hattiesburg.
M:	she's not a teacher.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	how about uh how do you feel about it?
B:	yeah. i'll bet they're involved. yeah.
M:	yeah. yeah. yeah
B:	yeah
M:	they have a good looking uh child care facility.
B:	well that's uh i know it's it's a real hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities.
M:	i know it is.
B:	out here at manford they have a you know a a a real good facility and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that.
M:	i'm gonna go to the uh library.
B:	so it's uh uh you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
M:	i don't know.
B:	and i think this is really  is buyer beware.  well it is the best way  to do it interestingly.
M:	because i know that it's going to be an expensive process.
B:	i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
M:	i
B:	because i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care.
M:	s
B:	primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
M:	not.
B:	it's it's phenomenal. it's phenomenal the programming the human operating system
