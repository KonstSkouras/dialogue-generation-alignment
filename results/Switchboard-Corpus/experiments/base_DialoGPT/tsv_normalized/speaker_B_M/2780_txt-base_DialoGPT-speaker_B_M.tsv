B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh talk to me you know.
B:	well it's very true now i'm a uh new yorker by birth.
M:	i
B:	although i claim florida as my home now uh i have two sons living down there but i also have two sons living elsewhere  one in tennessee one in mississippi.
M:	you have.
B:	but i lived in in florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.
M:	i'm a floridian and i think florida is a beautiful state.
B:	i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal.
M:	it's okay.
B:	i mean they they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
M:	ah i see. they didn't allow guns back then.
B:	but they uh quickly did away with it.
M:	they were also not allowed to carry concealed weapons.
B:	i think in the next session they they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh florida.
M:	yeah i heard they changed it to a felony.
B:	the the one week uh seven day the delay
M:	it's been a week
B:	uh huh.
M:	yea but the 7 day wait
B:	well i don't mind that too much
M:	oh i get it.
B:	i'm i'm with the n r a myself.

B:	and uh uh really the only objection we have is uh you you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
M:	we don't have any objections.
B:	yeah.
M:	that's true.that's what i meant.
B:	well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal?
M:	i'm not.
B:	well let me ask you this then.
M:	i am not.
B:	how is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the american flag?
M:	i'm not
B:	huh.
M:	you know what? i'm not sure.
B:	well now wait a minute there
M:	i would never burn the american
B:	you just said it. it's their right by freedom of speech? what does speech have to do with burning a flag?
M:	i said it's their'right '.
B:	now uh well i i still go back to ...
M:	
B:	then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
M:	
B:	uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.
M:	uuh i don't.
B:	uh yeah
M:	uhhh you know the flag isnt the
B:	but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by freedom of speech which has nothing to do with action.
M:	i don't think it's a good argument.
B:	now i am i am adamantly against that.
M:	it is the right to peacefully assemble
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i am
B:	huh.

M:	you can't have a flag and a freedom.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh... i i i don't know...
B:	well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
M:	i would never uhhh.

M:	no it's not.
B:	uh um so long as it's their possession. ok you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country
M:	heh sure you can have your flag.
B:	and i used to know as a boy scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it.
M:	uhm you're not the only one.
B:	and to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.
M:	i think that's just an old man saying that.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yes. i agree.
B:	it's it's very easy to do.
M:	what's the deal with the'uh '?
B:	uh uh-huh.
M:	that's how you
B:	well i think it should be permitted under certain
M:	this is an abortion.
