B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh did you go to the e o?

M:	uhhh uh i didn't think that the epub was a thing yet.
B:	right. so what what is the e p a recommending now?
M:	i don't know. i'm just a little confused.
B:	uh-huh.

B:	right. that's a that's a common problem though. that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose.
M:	.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	this is it
B:	right.
M:	i don't
B:	well that's good.
M:	i've had a few people have said that they're not buying it.
B:	right. there has to be uh a reuse for it. i mean that's why they recycle. the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
M:	
B:	and uh i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
M:	they are recy recycle
B:	uh-huh.

B:	huh.
M:	solar panels can't even do that.
