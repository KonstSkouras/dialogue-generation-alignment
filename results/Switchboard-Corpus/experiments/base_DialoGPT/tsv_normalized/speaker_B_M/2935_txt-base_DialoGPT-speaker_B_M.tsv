B:	you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.
M:	uh
B:	so right now we're just
M:	i don't know it's just been raining for a while.
B:	yeah we we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now and the trees. we have a peach tree. that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply. but that's nice to have
M:	oh.
B:	yeah. so what do you do up there?
M:	he smiles and nods
B:	um.
M:	oh yeah. what do you mean?
B:	oh wow.
M:	he has been out since the last day of spring.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know what to say.it's just something i've noticed.
B:	really. gosh.
M:	well i've been watching the show for the last year.
B:	oh boy
M:	well they're all tomatoes.
B:	that sounds wonderful.
M:	i have to make some of those plants and tomatoes.
B:	if you don't have a frost you'll be all right that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten and you'd have to.
M:	i don't know but it's the same as it's always been.
B:	wow. uh-huh.
M:	you.
B:	oh boy that's frustrating.
M:	you're and
B:	oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me
M:	ahh that's interesting. my son and i do the mow the grass.
B:	i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long. and uh i i was in england once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it. you know it could be three feet by four feet or something.
M:	
B:	so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy into it. course we have two little kids that are two and three years old
M:	
B:	so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you
M:	the.
B:	yeah that's really lovely. i would love to have different fruit trees. it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches. they're just delicious. and we we we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.
M:	
B:	um we've tried them but again it's just like the sun scorch.
M:	you?
B:	we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the i mean it's just you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the summer.
M:	how long what?
B:	people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that
M:	we have done that.
B:	and um that's really what makes the most sense because you don't have to use so much water and
M:	we do have a water system.
B:	it really does the job. but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here. and if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then it's burned up you know.
M:	i'e?
B:	it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that
M:	i'm too
B:	yeah. yeah it just gets so hot so fast here. we don't have really a spring or a fall
M:	...
B:	and it just uh immediately heats up. so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember um you know the long springs and long falls and the cooler weather. it was really nice.
M:	you?
B:	we always had gardens when i was uh living in chicago. in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it. i'll never forget. got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner. i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him they remodeled the entire back yard. then they sold the house and got divorced so i don't know what that says about it all
M:	
B:	oh but she used to love to do stuff like that.
M:	sheroflip.
B:	yeah it really was. i enjoyed it there. but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because they like to see things grow. they've done a couple of little seed projects and so i think it would be fun for them.
M:	that?
B:	yeah yeah.
M:	i'm sorry i think i just saw you in the garden of my friends.
B:	oh yes they're both running around now.
M:	i don't think you can do that.
B:	yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know.
M:	ah i see.
B:	they certainly enjoy that part of it it's just trying to keep anything. i planted bulbs last uh fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the spring and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
M:	
B:	he thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with? at least he didn't eat them i mean i guess i could be thankful for that.
M:	i'm sorry
B:	yeah really. if they survive this year. oh well good luck to you.
M:	we are you too
B:	nice talking to you.
M:	i'm good thanks.
