B:	it's you know it's a game to her but i i do not like to do that i consider it kind of a a waste of my time. and so i'm usually uh pretty careful when i shop
M:	i see.
B:	and i also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure uh it has the features in it that i want.
M:	so uh
B:	now we've had one lately um oh a uh a dustbuster plus that we bought
M:	well
B:	and we've had it for a while but all of a sudden it just wasn't working and it looks like there's a part missing from it. my husband opened it up and whatever and of course we don't have the receipt any more so we can't take it back
M:	...
B:	uh but i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
M:	uhhh you're right.
B:	uh
M:	uh but they have a receipt
B:	yeah.
M:	so you're saying you could have the entire thing done in 5 years?
B:	well that's true and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it's
M:	we are the best at something. we are the only ones who can afford to buy a new car and we are the worst at it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	they are the most expensive ones in the
B:	well yeah i think a lot of times if you get a brand name uh you know if it's a a good brand
M:	why
B:	i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything but uh i think more often than not
M:	there's no lemon in that.
B:	you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and uh you know if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it
M:	you uh you're a genius.
B:	i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
M:	ohh i thought you were talking about the lemon.
B:	we never could get it declared a lemon and the car would go and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
M:	you can't
B:	and i there was just you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and and everything and they got it finally semifixed but it was such a hassle
M:	oh you there were no
B:	yeah yeah it it really is uh but gee this is of all the topics i have had i'm doing this thing this is kind of the strangest one.
M:	i am
B:	uh-huh.
M:	that.
B:	well i think that's true and i uh now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it.
M:	not. i i i and.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	you're welcome!
B:	i think technology is better i'm i'm not sure. i think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
M:	you.
B:	i don't think necessarily that things are being made better uh you know
M:	i
B:	i i everything is so automated uh and things can be made without i think a human hand ever touching it you know an awful lot of things
M:	what is the point of this?
B:	and i think that certainly makes a difference from back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and you know had some pride in it.
M:	it was done in an art program.
B:	well yeah that's that's true.
M:	you know i'm pretty sure the amount of time that's going to be spent
B:	yeah well i i do uh you know craft work and sell stuff at shows and that and uh uh you know it's it's it's a real eye-opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know.
