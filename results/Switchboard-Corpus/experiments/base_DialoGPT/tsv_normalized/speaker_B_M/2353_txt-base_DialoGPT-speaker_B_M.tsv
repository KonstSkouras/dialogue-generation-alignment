B:	and i think they're better people because of it,
M:	yeah, and i think that's the reason why people do it.
B:	they're much more responsible. i know, um, the church that i go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,
M:	i don't know, i don't think i've ever seen a church that gives me the same chance as a child.
B:	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and i i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.
M:	uhh, i'm not really sure what you mean.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yes.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm just kidding
B:	uh-huh.
M:	um... i did that, um... for the money.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, i don't know how to spell, but i know i've got a degree in it.
B:	huh.
M:	uhuhuh. uhuh.
B:	yeah.
M:	you're.
B:	huh. and rattling in
M:	i'm waiting for them to finish my graduate year, i'm so nervous.
B:	yes. yes.
M:	so you have a church?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	that's weird.
B:	uh-huh. well, i think so, it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,
M:	i'm a guy
B:	i mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
M:	u uuuuuuuu uh
B:	and i think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
M:	uhuh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	how about that
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uuh.
B:	oh, no.
M:	uh, uh, yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... uh, i'm high school.
B:	right. uh-huh.
M:	1.
B:	yes.
M:	i don't i do you don't really, don't, we are you, we, you, and you dont you, just, you're not, you...
B:	it would really, um, and i don't the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, i don't exactly recommend
M:	what do you mean by that?
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
M:	not really. they're not a bad country.
B:	and, um, you know, although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them
M:	oh yeah, it's just that they are a little too well off to be in the military.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
M:	you know, um, the school is just a bunch of people with a lot of experience and experience.
B:	and like she's washing
M:	i mean, they are, but they're not like a normal person.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	well, they do have the best voice of any student in the history of the school, if that counts.
B:	well, that's right. a lot of people they flunk out or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying
M:	i know. i have a problem with it. i've seen it happen.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing
M:	yeah, but they do the same things to other people.
B:	and,
M:	they are also the biggest family in the world
B:	um.
M:	the'u'is silent.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	uhh... that's weird.
B:	because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like
M:	why would you say that?
B:	but, you know, our, like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not
M:	you know, we have, uh, uh... the freedom to do, uh
B:	you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
M:	you're allowed to do things?
B:	and so,
M:	well, it's not that, it is that,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think it be like that.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	you guys are weird.
B:	and they're preoccupied with, drinking.
M:	well, the last two years have been a... uh,...
B:	uh-huh. and
M:	uhhh, uh, i think they're having a great time.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh... how is it?
B:	that's true. paper
M:	today s young people will be short term pleasure oriented
B:	that's really true.
M:	everything has to have a payoff.
B:	yeah. well, i, i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um,
M:	i don't even know.
B:	oh, really.
M:	they do.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not sure what's the point of this post, but i'm
B:	huh.
M:	they do.
B:	well, i have seen a big change, i think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my, what i was going to study
M:	i was in middle school and i had no idea. i have no idea what i want to do.
B:	and at least i had some interest in, a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are, they say oh, i want to be a doctor, i want to be a lawyer. why? because they make a lot of money.
M:	i'm sorry
B:	and they don't have a goal, they don't have a goal, they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
M:	i have a goal.
B:	they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
M:	why don't you have a job?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm pretty sure the lawyers would disagree with you
B:	yes.
M:	are you serious?
B:	there's just too many people. uh-huh. that's right. not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.
M:	well, i mean, there are a lot of people that are a part of the community.
B:	you know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, um, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... uh
B:	that's kind of sad. well, anyway.
M:	lawyer and doctor make the least money in my country.and.they don't.
B:	well, i guess i better go.
M:	uh huh.
B:	well, good luck to you. i enjoyed it.
M:	he smiles back i know. i just think it's funny how it seems like he has no problem with it.
B:	thanks. bye-bye.
