B:	yes, we're not too long distance today.
M:	are you guys still going?
B:	oh, that was good. utah, i've had a couple of, but that was it.
M:	you must be from the east coast
B:	yeah.
M:	you know, i'm not too sure.
B:	learned about their basketball team
M:	did you learn about the utah jazz?
B:	uh, jazz.
M:	which team?
B:	yeah.
M:	he's a jazz fan.
B:	yeah.
M:	well. they were in utah for a while.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean. yeah.
B:	i am.
M:	i'm confused.
B:	okay.
M:	i'm not.
B:	nancy.
M:	you mean to say what?
B:	right.
M:	i'm not sure who you are.
B:	right.
M:	i'm brian.
B:	right.
M:	i don't think i can give you a job.
B:	uh-huh. well, i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job.
M:	are you going to be able to pay for yourself?
B:	i'm a nurse and i work,
M:	i don't know. what's your job?
B:	i float so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i, i make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
M:	it's because you're not getting any benefits
B:	right. uh-huh.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
M:	ah, so you have to pay more than the cost of the job?
B:	and then i have my freedom. i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do.
M:	the only thing i can think of is you being paid for your time.
B:	well, it is to me. most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,
M:	i'm just not sure how it would be financially wise to do that.
B:	and i'm just really not interested in all that.
M:	i think it's mostly the first one.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... you know, i'm not sure.
B:	right.
M:	yes...
B:	yeah. right, and especially if you have a family.
M:	you've got to get some
B:	then i think it makes a big difference.
M:	i think the group discount is a little more important than that.
B:	yeah.
M:	do you have to be a parent to have a job?
B:	right.
M:	i have insurance.
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	the work schedule.
B:	right. could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?
M:	every week
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i.
B:	yeah.
M:	yeah. i'm really enjoyed it
B:	yeah.
M:	you're... flexible?
B:	oh, well, i guess, retirement, that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so
M:	i mean, it's just an example.
B:	i just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so,
M:	i don't really care about my retirement, i'm just here for the money.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	oh, well, i just feel better about myself today.
B:	right.
M:	ummow
