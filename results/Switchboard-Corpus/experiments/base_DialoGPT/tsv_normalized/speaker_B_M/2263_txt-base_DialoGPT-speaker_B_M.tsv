B:	and then it was all year, there was just copperheads everywhere.
M:	and then the rain started.
B:	yeah. well i lived down in, down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time.
M:	oh. yeah.
B:	if it rained we were stuck back in there. had a four wheel drive.
M:	so it was ok then?
B:	you just get used to it.
M:	i'm still waiting for them to get out of the hole.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh. you're walking

M:	are you ok?
B:	yeah. yeah, it was. saw a few bears things like that.
M:	i'm pretty sure you can get into the cave
B:	yeah.
M:	were you in the bears camp?
B:	yeah, the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary but, uh, after that you realize they are just as afraid of you, too.
M:	that's what i was thinking. i'm going to have to go and check the woods out.
B:	but, uh,
M:	that's the first time i've ever seen a cat be afraid of me.
B:	oh, really?
M:	it's because they're afraid of your gun
B:	i don't know if, they don't have them up there do they?
M:	they are on the rise in the area.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh. so... where do they go?
B:	oh, do they?
M:	i know, but they are there
B:	yeah, they, down here they, they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them.
M:	i'm in the us, i just thought they were already extinct.
B:	i don't know what it's like now, i haven't been back up there in awhile.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	well, it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.
M:	yes, but it's mostly for the camping.
B:	so,
M:	you know, i'm not too sure about this place.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh. well, you're a girl, so...
