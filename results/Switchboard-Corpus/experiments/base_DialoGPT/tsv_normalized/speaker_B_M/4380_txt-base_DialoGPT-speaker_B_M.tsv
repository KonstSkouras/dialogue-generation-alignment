B:	and i
M:	oh and i?
B:	okay uh i've the high school i went to was uh was a good one also. and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. because the one i went to was you know i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	you are you not in the school you know?
B:	what
M:	well
B:	yeah that's true.
M:	and
B:	yeah.  and i'm also  i mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would you know in areas where they
M:	i think that's it.

B:	uh-huh.  yeah.  uh-huh.
M:	i.
B:	no i i can't say that i have either. but uh
M:	i don't but
B:	yeah. i've i've heard some i mean i've heard statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education. i mean within like within the same uh income groups.
M:	nope.. uh.
B:	if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private  schools.
M:	private school.
B:	i think they compare you know fairly well.
M:	not really they don't compare you in any way.
B:	yeah. i i i my schools i mean there i have a lot of once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
