B:	uh, i don't, i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh,
M:	it's aight
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	no, you should be
B:	exactly. uh-huh. uh, i don't know. i, uh, you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, falsely accused but, uh, more than likely the people that are on the, the jury know what they're doing. uh, i mean you,
M:	.u'
B:	never.
M:	i'll
B:	huh. well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and i, i know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.
M:	
B:	exactly. uh-huh, exactly. uh,
M:	...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i
B:	uh-huh.
M:	u mean, you, i don't??
B:	i've, i've never i've never even been called to jury duty.
M:	you've, i've seen the movie, but never seen the book.
B:	yeah. i, uh, i don't know, i think the, i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
M:	i don't
B:	uh-huh.  uh-huh.
M:	i'm not
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm
B:	right.
M:	i think i'd rather be
B:	uh-huh.
M:	.
B:	i, uh, i i, i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
M:	...
B:	least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
M:	i, uh, i don t know.
B:	judge
M:	why do you want to do that?
B:	right, exactly
M:	if you have jury members who are paid to do jury duty, you pay them a salary of 20,000.
B:	probably, yeah yeah. but, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though, that, uh, that the people, though, that you, you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
M:	i mean, you could say that about any job.
B:	and, uh, or they fool the, the defense in thinking that they're, you know, because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
M:	i know, i know,
B:	exactly.
M:	i.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah
B:	oh, yeah. well,
M:	no, i mean, i'll just ask them about it.
B:	i guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know. if it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was innocent and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
M:	what's the verdict?
B:	but, uh, if everyone would take it, i think if everyone took it seriously
M:	i think that's how it should be, i think they would get away with it if it wasn't for
B:	yeah.
M:	well, i'm sure there are other cases like this.
B:	i would love to be called, i'm ready to go they just haven't called me up yet
M:	it's a shame that they're not called, i'd love to have a team called
B:	it was nice talking to you.
M:	sorry about that.
B:	bye-bye.
