M:	you can call me
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know what's up.
B:	right.
M:	well uhuh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	they're all back together now.
B:	well it might be a good time for you to to to start a tradition.
M:	i'm not sure
B:	you could be responsible for that yourself.
M:	the only time i've ever been to the place was when i was in high school
B:	sure.
M:	well that's not true.
B:	well in my family let's see last october was the forty fifth annual  uh reunion.
M:	he shrugs. i've been around for a long time.
B:	the first sunday in october the jordan family gets together.
M:	what about the jordan?
B:	and all of the descendants of the civil war i mean yeah the civil war veterans come together and they come as far away from california and there's usually oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
M:	well they are.
B:	uh there's a big community hall in vernon texas
M:	what is this?
B:	and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family.
M:	that's a little different.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... wait do you have any relatives in virginia?
B:	right uh-huh. a lot of the older family lives in vernon.
M:	that sounds cool.
B:	um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.
M:	uh what?
B:	so we're talking about second and third great children here.
M:	i'm not sure if that's how it works.
B:	uh i take my boys well i took them up until this year they're grown and gone from home now
M:	why not?
B:	so they they take their family.
M:	so they they their their
B:	but uh let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild. and so they
M:	that's what i said.
B:	well it's a community center it's a community hall. it's  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in
M:	what is this?
B:	and uh you just bring the covered dishes. every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes  that have been handed  down for years
M:	so
B:	well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them.
M:	i'll have you know that i am a vegetarian.
B:	and we choose to bring congealed salad. you can bring a congealed vegetable salad  as opposed to potato salad.
M:	we have a lot of stuff in the us so we can have a salad in
B:	and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh sanitation aspects  whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
M:	i don't think you can.
B:	i always take home baked bread.
M:	yes but only for you.
B:	uh that happens to be my specialty for that family. i do other things very well
M:	i know right?
B:	but there are others in the family who do them better.
M:	i do.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... are you okay?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhuh. uhuh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh... how?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhh the catholic church is still there.
B:	uh-huh.  right.
M:	i.
B:	well it's uh we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization
M:	
B:	and they plan the reunions the organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer. uh and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles.
M:	'
B:	we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book. and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone. and it keeps the family alive  even you know even though it's very fluid.
M:	 and
B:	and they're very dedicated to that and uh it's been really wonderful. it helps you hang onto your roots.
M:	...
B:	and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging. my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family. his family was very scattered and very diverse.
M:	i felt.
B:	"and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing. ""well i don't know i haven't  talked to my brother in three years."" i said  ""well how's your brother doing?"" ""i don't know."" uh you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i don't."
M:	oh.
B:	"i said ""hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"" ""yeah but i'm you know it's too much trouble."" so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family. and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at lake tawakoni."
M:	...
B:	liked to kill me because i it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did  it by myself.
M:	
B:	and uh nobody brought covered dishes. we had a great big fish fry and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub.
M:	what i?
B:	and and uh it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping. and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him
M:	right.
B:	"we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there. we sent invitations. we said ""please let us know if you're coming."" it was when uh his mother his step father had died the year before"
M:	i was
B:	and it his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his you know his sisters he began to lose family members
M:	we.
B:	and it was difficult to hold them together. and then of course he died two years ago so you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
M:	and
B:	and uh it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the the family unit you know falls  into disrepair.
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	heh what?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	we had a second reunion
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... and so it wound up.
B:	uh-huh. well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive. they'll send out news bulletins. two or three times a year you'll get a news hey guess who got you know elected to the legislature or guess who our local sheriff
