M:	you in detroit?

B:	and that was real nice. uh,
M:	yeah, it was.
B:	no, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
M:	i'm from canada, so i can't say that i've seen that.
B:	yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
M:	have you ever been there?

M:	i'm
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yea.but what if it was too easy?
B:	well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too, and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,
M:	yeah, i was.
B:	and i think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. because it's something you weren't forced to do
M:	i don't know, i don't really have any friends
B:	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
M:	i have a strong interest in learning, and i'm not sure what that means.
B:	and you're more receptive.

B:	oh, that's exciting.
M:	i don't know. i've been to spain and france.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	uhh. i was there.
B:	uh-huh. well, i had a friend that, uh, visited england not, well, i think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to england, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
