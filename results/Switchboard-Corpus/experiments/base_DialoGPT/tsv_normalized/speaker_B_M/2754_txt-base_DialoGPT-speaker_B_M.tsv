B:	and, uh. yeah, how do you feel about it?
M:	it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i believe in the, and
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	yea i'm gonna have to go with no.
B:	right, exactly.
M:	it
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i would of course
B:	right. if, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?
M:	i think you mean that.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i dunno.
B:	well, i think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, i don't know, i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,
M:	i think so.
B:	i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
M:	uh, well, uh, i don't know a jury, you know, because, uh...
B:	yeah, i don't think we,
M:	i'm in pennsylvania
B:	no, huh-uh. no we don't.
M:	i think we have that
B:	yeah.
M:	you mean it's not?
B:	uh-huh. oh, yeah they're always in florida. florida and louisiana, i think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.
M:	florida? what?
B:	course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
M:	yeah.uhh. you're right.
B:	get that unemployment way up so then people, you know tend towards crime, and then they they start stiffening the penalties.
M:	i don't know.
B:	well, in florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year. it's constantly on the,
M:	it.
B:	yeah.  no, that's true. course they have a requirement that, uh, that every single appeal must be permitted.
M:	i',
B:	so, of course, the, the attorneys,
M:	no, it's not.
B:	they go all the way up to the supreme court, you know.
M:	well, the supreme court has no power to appeal.
B:	they almost always get thrown right back out again, but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.
M:	i don't know about you but i've never seen a judge or jury that wasn't guilty of a crime.
B:	some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent son of sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
M:	i've never seen anyone get beaten up like that.
B:	i mean, they,
M:	i'm sorry, but how do you think they do that?
B:	everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.
M:	and they get them out.
B:	yeah.
M:	so they get the same treatment as the rest of us?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you don't know that.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know.
B:	i think so.
M:	no, i think you're the only one.
B:	uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about. although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,
M:	what do you mean?
B:	i mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be, they can't, i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. i don't think the parole system is really helping that much
M:	the way i understand it is that they're going to get the same treatment as the inmates.
B:	reduce the violence in the prisons. i think that's its only purpose is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. off earlier.
M:	...
B:	but some of these guys just don't care,  you know. and so, uh,
M:	so. uh
B:	yeah, right, uh-huh.
M:	i don't think you know what that word means.
B:	um, that's possible i guess.
M:	maybe he's a murderer.
B:	um, so where do you live in pennsylvania?
M:	i was just saying what it is.uh
B:	oh, okay. i don't think i really know that.
M:	in pennsylvania.
B:	because, uh, you know, that all depends, too, on where you are at. that's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, i mean less,
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm.
B:	two hours where?
M:	...
B:	oh, okay. near polk?
M:	near pittsburg.
B:	polk institute. it's, uh, an old, uh, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. uh,
M:	what is that?
B:	very old, uh, historical place there.
M:	oh, i've heard of it.
B:	sharon, pennsylvania's up there.
M:	well, that's not a place.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh. well, okay.
B:	oh, okay.
M:	i'm in california.
B:	in that case, maybe, you know.
M:	i don't know.
B:	right. that's true. yeah, well, it, it, you know, you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,  done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,
M:	
B:	you just like, i don't want that person sharing the earth with me, you know, i mean, that is just terrible.
M:	you.
B:	and, uh, you know, we had a case like that here and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, uh, penalties can be very severe, they, uh, there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.
M:	
B:	yeah. well, i'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying. they're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
M:	no.
B:	right, uh-huh.
M:	they,.
B:	yeah, right.
M:	yeah, they deserve nothing. they deserve.
B:	uh-huh. i was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. and so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
M:	that's what i was saying.
B:	and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.
M:	because it is possible
B:	and, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but, there's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.
M:	i
B:	anyways, but, uh. yeah, we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like i said, he just, uh, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.
