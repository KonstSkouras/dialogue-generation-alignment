B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know, i'm just a dog.
B:	yeah. our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. so that's why we call her liberty.
M:	you're a lucky cat.
B:	do you want to hear about my other animals i've had?

B:	uh, let's see, i've had gerbils, i have, i had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
M:	what's your favourite animal?
B:	so at one point i had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
M:	you're not getting out.
B:	yes
M:	do you have a cat?
B:	it was litter trained
M:	is it a snake?
B:	and we had it perfumed
M:	we had it lit up for a while.
B:	and, uh, it was very aggressive.
M:	uh, that's not the only thing that's aggressive
B:	but all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	you're right.
B:	and the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	it was a dog and a cat.
B:	nobody came near it when he was there.
M:	he got away with it, he had a good run.
B:	oh.
M:	you know, the other day i was in the back of a house, and there was a dog.
B:	yeah, they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them, but the glands had been removed
M:	did they have to do this?
B:	so,
M:	he was very angry
B:	right.
M:	so we have a dog and a cat, right?
B:	yeah, i always said if i well, i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog
M:	i'm sorry i'm not like to talk
B:	that'd be the best way to be.
M:	i can't wait
B:	well we had a german shepherd and he had dysplasia
M:	he is a little bit crazy.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
M:	he's a very big dog. he's only 8 weeks old.
B:	so, when he died, we got a little one.
M:	i'm sorry for your loss.
B:	but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	she was almost a year old when we rescued her.
B:	yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
M:	he had a dog?
B:	so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
M:	i'm not saying it's impossible, i'm just saying that it's not a simple matter of how many times we say it.
B:	and then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico now.
M:	i was gonna say it, but then i saw the name.
B:	do you?
M:	i know, right? i think it's a little bit creepy.

B:	and we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
M:	i was, my cat died.
