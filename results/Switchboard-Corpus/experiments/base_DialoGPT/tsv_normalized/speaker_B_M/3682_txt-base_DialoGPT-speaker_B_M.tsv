M:	i have a lot of stuff you can use.
B:	yeah you can't enjoy it. right.
M:	i love it but i'm not sure if i'm going to enjoy it.
B:	that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven
M:	that and i have a lot of trouble with being a cook.
B:	it's
M:	i don't know.but it's
B:	everybody just says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes
M:	i love how it's the most popular cooking show on tv.
B:	i.
M:	uhhhhh.
B:	that's one of those things i got famous for in college. people would come and say could would you come over and make lasagna for me
M:	it's a small town.
B:	it's like well i can't really give you a recipe uh
M:	i think i'll just make lasagne and call it lasagna.
B:	i can i can just do it
M:	i don't know.
B:	i like doing that kind of stuff.
M:	you can't just do that.
B:	and it's it's fun in fact that's what we had for a christmas party last week.
M:	it's fun
B:	we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and uh yummy.
M:	i don't know what you're talking about.
B:	uh i do too in fact
M:	i do.
B:	oh. oh good.
M:	yes i am.
B:	uh actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners.
M:	it's just that i'm really tired and it's really hard to sleep.
B:	and have you know like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
M:	yeah it's like a lot of things i just have to be creative and stuff.
B:	and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff.
M:	we
B:	but it's it's inexpensive
M:	i think it's a fun thing.
B:	plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner.
M:	i've been using it as a cheat day. it's really good.
B:	it's it's real easy i like doing that part.
M:	if you don't mind can you explain how it's easy?
B:	i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games
M:	i don't think i can handle the idea of a lot of people having the same idea of what a lot is.
B:	and it's
M:	and it's
B:	we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids.
M:	ohh. uh.
B:	and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done.
M:	we're always here you're just not.
B:	and it's pretty cool.
M:	i guess.
B:	uh-huh. oh.
M:	i know but it's good.
B:	oh.
M:	you can eat the chicken rice
B:	oh i love it
M:	it is...
B:	um.
M:	oh.oh
B:	over the uncooked rice?
M:	i'm not sure how you can do that but i do it with a rice cooker.
B:	oh.
M:	you can cook it over rice you just have to use the right broth
B:	oh how neat.
M:	it's an oven and the rice is cooked in it.
B:	huh. now i've done it with where you put you cook the well i guess you probably could do it same way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it.
M:	i'm a vegetarian.
B:	and every once in a while i'll put in i'll slice white grapes and i'll put in there and that's just because i'm not a real big wine person but i like it it adds something to the chicken.
M:	yeah.
B:	and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.
M:	i like i'ma.
B:	yeah
M:	and it's good for you?
B:	it's that was one of the first things i made for my husband because i was like um yeah
M:	i just made some rice noodles and it looks like rice noodles.
B:	i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
M:	i'm not sure but i can find something that would look good.
B:	oh yeah.
M:	because you can't cook it in a cooking utensil.
B:	but then i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
M:	it's not as messy as you think it is.
B:	so just like in a thirteen by nine pan.
M:	not exactly. i've never cooked it.
B:	um.
M:	i mean... you put it in the pan right?
B:	um.
M:	you wanna see
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what is?
B:	yeah yeah i i use that for for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.
M:	i've been doing this with my rice. i put a cup of broth in there and then i add a little water.
B:	um. now that would be good.
M:	uhhh. uh. yeah.
B:	how long do you have to bake it?
M:	ohhhh okay i'm a big fan of the egg.
B:	i do i do microwave too a lot
M:	i want to eat it.
B:	how long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
M:	it's an egg. i'm not sure.
B:	oh okay. okay. do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
M:	i used a lot of brown rice but i did use brown rice.
B:	or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
M:	you can get the chicken straight up in the oven. i'm not sure how long you can cook it though.
B:	um. ooh this is a beneficial call. i like this
M:	i'm gonna try to eat it
B:	yeah but that one's an easy one. it's like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine
M:	i like the idea but it's a bit messy and messy.
B:	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that you know. what ever however much effort you feel like putting into it.
M:	what is this soup?
B:	but it it makes a great i mean i've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it.
M:	i dunno. i've always had a good i'm
B:	and because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful my good you're a picky eater if i can get you to
