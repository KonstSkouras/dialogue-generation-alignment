B:	so this is the big issue with us. although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but perhaps they are little for words to be said like day care and quality time and
M:	i do.but i don'' know what they are.
B:	anyway. you don't have children?
M:	well i'm not sure. i don'know.
B:	but you're married?
M:	i am.
B:	oh.
M:	i think you have to have been married a year or two before this
B:	you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call. i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting. could i ask you to hold one minute?
M:	what's the number?
B:	i'll be right back.  excuse me  just a moment. they're going to get mad
M:	i'm going to hold you to that.
B:	hello?
M:	how do you feel about a child support?
B:	i'm so sorry.
M:	you know what i like?
B:	that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow brownie meeting.
M:	no i'm not.
B:	well i don't want to i don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but yes we do. both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade. and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful.
M:	i love you.
B:	the kids they are real people and they are interesting and they they have all their own activities and um i think as parents we really enjoy them in in our personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel
M:	i can't
B:	i'm sure that's coming though. but  they are wonderful kids.
M:	how are you?
B:	you had eight boys and one girl?
M:	...
B:	are you mormons?
M:	that's how i got my wife and my wife's friend
B:	that's what the utah and the large family.
M:	yeah. they have a nice house.
B:	well we're catholics. i came from a family of five. i had four brothers
M:	well i came in from a dead family so i'm not sure if that's how it works.
B:	the only girl.
M:	which one?
B:	and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.
M:	i don't know. i've never had a girl.
B:	i never felt spoiled. in fact i always thought my toys were destroyed
M:	i don't know if it's because i'm a girl but i feel that way.
B:	no. usually busy fighting for survival.
M:	what's up with the guy in the picture?
B:	well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here. um  that i think um
M:	it's a good thing.
B:	i don't know. it's an interesting problem. i happen to um i'm a pediatrician.
M:	what about it?
B:	my husband is a physician so uh i i i talk to parents about this a lot. but children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt  that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family.
M:	...
B:	and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing. and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home.
M:	you.
B:	i really believe that. and it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure. and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot
M:	i.
B:	so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's i really think it's true for our family  and i think it has worked very well.
M:	you
B:	there's no question i think that's really the best. if if a woman is happy doing that
M:	your right.
B:	i hate to put it quite that way.
M:	well i hate to say it but...
B:	i was twenty-nine when i had my first child and uh i would not have been real fulfilled. i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child.
M:	she's like 10 years old.
B:	it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but uh i like i like the way i did it.
M:	you're a terrible parent.
B:	i sort of worked half time. i had very flexible hours. i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year and i  you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers.
M:	
B:	um and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in.
M:	what do you think?
B:	some baby-sitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they they learn to share. they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.
M:	yes
B:	i think that helps.
M:	yeah but what if they were around too?
B:	well so so . so your wife does she work right now?
M:	i'm not.
B:	she's out
M:	so how's your wife?
B:	you're still trying to dry out?
M:	seattle wa.
