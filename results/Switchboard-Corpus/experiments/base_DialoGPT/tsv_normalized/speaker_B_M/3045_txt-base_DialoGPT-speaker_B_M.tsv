B:	and my in-laws also have one, and they're almost as close.
M:	my parents have a similar one.the only thing i can think of is that it's a special type of water.
B:	they're in richardson.
M:	where do you live?
B:	um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
M:	what do you mean?
B:	also i have a nine year old that i've been home schooling for the last three years.
M:	oh, i've never been home schooled.
B:	and we got, uh, the one that my parents have is an apple two e.
M:	ah, okay.
B:	and i have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the fort worth school district.
M:	it's my sister in law's name.
B:	and so she got me copies of, uh, several of the apple programs for school programs,
M:	uh... um...
B:	and so we use those and there's some, whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game, so, that's part of it.
M:	i just like to play games with my mom.
B:	um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,
M:	how does one use a computer?
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
M:	wait, what?
B:	yeah.
M:	uh, uh, how did you get these?
B:	i'm, uh, my father had a software company,
M:	oh. that's cool.
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
M:	i wonder what that's like.
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
M:	they have a computer and a radio, and a computer.
B:	but, um, they're kind of old older
M:	yeah, it's a little bit older.
B:	so i'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
M:	we have a program for that, we'll just have to see what it is.
B:	oh. i have one of those. yeah.
M:	...
B:	mine's broke at the moment, but
M:	i'm not.
B:	oh.
M:	i have a. 22 in my living room.

M:	did you learn that?
B:	and so i learned that on there too, that was,
M:	...
B:	i haven't. that's the one that my father, well, i guess i have used it once or twice.
M:	you can't spell, i mean, have you ever been able to spell?
B:	uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.
M:	you've never used it?
B:	he's got on i b m.
M:	i'm guessing he has an i m in his computer.
B:	and, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
M:	i know, but it's on the computer in my room.
B:	that's what i've heard.

M:	it's the other way around.
B:	oh, how wonderful.
M:	...
B:	that, i had heard that that was better. that was a better one.
M:	i, uh, you, you mean that?
B:	yeah. yeah, i agree
M:	i think it's the most fun, the most interesting, and the least spoiled
B:	not too much. what kind of, what kind of things do you write?
M:	you?
B:	oh
M:	well, i was just a writer.
B:	to her go talk to daddy about it. excuse me.
M:	i have no idea what you're talking about
B:	to her go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy i unplugged it for you. but you don't need to drag it down the hall
M:	yes, but it was in the attic.
B:	daddy, daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged
M:	i'm sorry for your loss.
B:	yeah.
M:	yeah. it's like he's gonna be back.
B:	huh.
M:	... she's an artist
B:	yeah.
M:	i'm... schl'er, sch... er... schm, i mean... schoo'er...
B:	yeah. i'm anxious some day to have one here.
M:	oh. i am?
B:	i'm, and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.
M:	oh. well, yeah.
B:	my nine year old i've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
M:	well, what is it?
B:	so.
M:	i'm not good at typing.
B:	yeah.
M:	you can type on the computer?
B:	i've,
M:	i have.
B:	that's right.
M:	she's not going to have any of those.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	uh, what?
B:	we've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.
M:	he smiles and nods.
B:	and so i, and i wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
M:	what?
B:	and so i decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
M:	oh. she could've just typed it out.
B:	so we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
M:	i've been told by others to make a story.
B:	yes, yes. i agree.
M:	i agree. she can still learn to type.
B:	yeah.
M:	she shrugs. i've been in a relationship for a while.
