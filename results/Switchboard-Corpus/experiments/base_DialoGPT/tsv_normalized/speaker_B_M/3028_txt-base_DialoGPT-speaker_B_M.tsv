B:	right
M:	you? um, i'm not sure.
B:	well, i, i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
M:	yeah, i'm not really sure. i don't really have any plans for the next year, so i'm kinda just gonna wait for the new year.
B:	well, a little bit for the price,
M:	how about food?
B:	but, uh, i think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places i've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
M:	i like to eat at the most, and eat a lot of food.
B:	really. um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
M:	i'm sure i can find some
B:	some of the, some of the best food i have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like, i'm not eating in there are you nuts? and, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	lol
B:	yeah.
M:	i guess. you?
B:	i'm serious.
M:	you serious?
B:	um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to atchafalaya.
M:	she nods.
B:	no, that's not right. that's not right. that's not right.
M:	is that right?
B:	someone in the what's the name of that restaurant? in the background where at? . someone in the background the hari krishna. in the background relies oh. kalachandji's . kalachandji's. it's all vegetarian, and it, it was just fabulous. i mean, my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it.
M:	
B:	um, kalachandji's. it's, uh, it's a hari krishna run restaurant.
M:	i'm aghas aghaf.
B:	yes.
M:	so, you're
B:	uh, i think so. it should be.
M:	you're the best.
B:	uh, it starts with a k.
M:	oh. that's right.
B:	so k a l a, i think, c h a n d.
M:	i can't tell if you're talking about me or the guy.
B:	that should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. i think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
M:	yeah, i have to go to a restaurant. i'm not sure where i can find it.
B:	but it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
M:	you're the best.
B:	well, we like arby's. as far as, fast food goes.
M:	you can't really get it if you have no fast food
B:	oh, really? why?
M:	you don't have to like it.
B:	oh, no, no, no. someone has been lying to you. what they use is roast beef.
M:	but why do they make meat
B:	that's what, oh, my goodness.
M:	roasted beef?
B:	i'm surprised. my dad worked for arby's for several years.
M:	so, uh, what are you going to do when you're done?
B:	yeah.
M:	he chuckles.
B:	well, that's happened before.
M:	they have been known to steal your food.
B:	but we like good uh, we're, we like mexican food.
M:	i like it, but i'm not sure why.
B:	and stuff like that. and so, um,
M:	oh, uh, yeah.
B:	a health food?
M:	we like, eat, uh, food.
B:	like, like, name one
M:	i don't know. i'm not a doctor.
B:	i'm not sure what you're talking about.
M:	are you talking about the food or the food?
B:	huh.
M:	they're called'rood
B:	i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so, i really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	no. why is it?
B:	it would be good i think,
M:	i think they would be.
B:	uh, i don't know how expensive they are. it sounds like that it would probably,
M:	hmm, i wonder if they're expensive.
B:	for one person?
M:	i don't think so, i got a deal
B:	oh
M:	a lot of people have a small family.
B:	a bit
M:	how about you?
B:	yeah, i, i won't really be interested in going to, in going there. because, i feel like i'm, i'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
M:	you could, uh, not be interested.
B:	yeah. maybe, maybe that. yeah.
M:	i'll show them.
B:	yeah.  i could see that, then maybe.
M:	maybe, i could
B:	yeah, i like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
M:	you know, i think it's pretty cool.
B:	yeah. probably that's true. but i know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
M:	well,
B:	now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
M:	i know
B:	that's one of my husband's pet peeves. he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
M:	fish and chips.
B:	oh, really?
M:	no, they don't.
B:	oh, catfish is wonderful.
M:	the north.
B:	oh, really.
M:	they're all amazing.
B:	really.
M:	really really
B:	why?
M:	i'll be here.
B:	oh. huh.
M:	there's a lot of water in the ocean.
B:	that's too bad, because i'm probably not going to stop eating it
M:	i have been told that i can eat it without a problem.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i like chicken.
B:	that's true.
M:	i don't know, i don't like being on the look out for people i'm worried about.
B:	oh, on one hand i see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
M:	yeah, that's why i'm confused.
B:	so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
M:	well, it's not really a nuclear weapon, so there's that.
B:	and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
M:	uhhh, they
B:	oh. and then they wouldn't think. they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them.
M:	i think that's how they got the radiation.
B:	and this is before i was born.
M:	you were born in 1988.
B:	so, i mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
M:	yes. we did.
B:	and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
M:	oh, i know, i was just wondering.
B:	you can't get away from it so i think, to some point,
M:	but what's the label on the label?
B:	yeah,  you know. so there's, you know, there's some things i think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, this is not in my control.
M:	yeah, that's why i said it.
B:	so i'm either going to be, i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can, you know.
M:	i don't think so.
