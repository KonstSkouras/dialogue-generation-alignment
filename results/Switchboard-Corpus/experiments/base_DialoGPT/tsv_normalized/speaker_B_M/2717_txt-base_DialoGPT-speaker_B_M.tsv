B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think you're confusing the sentence with the sentence.
B:	yeah.  uh-huh well from what i i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this year or was it during the last year during a year's time i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. meanwhile there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.
M:	n
B:	uh-huh.
M:	no
B:	yeah everybody's got that.
M:	so.
B:	uh-huh.  yeah.   uh-huh.
M:	no but you can.
B:	yeah.  isn't isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was.
M:	well?
B:	it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. in the in the presidential race. uh may it may not have been maryland. it may have been massachusetts i don't remember.
M:	maryland
B:	anyway well the question is you know do you think it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right?
M:	i'ma
B:	if it
M:	i think it does.
B:	uh-huh
M:	yeah what?
B:	yeah. well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
M:	because the justice system is flawed.
B:	the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh you know their their success rate is very high. crime does pay you can make a good living at it.
M:	i'm not sure.
B:	yeah.
M:	a
B:	last year it was d c i guess baltimore caught them.
M:	you got lucky
B:	uh-huh
M:	i'm sorry but we have to keep it alive and alive and not die.
B:	yeah.
M:	so uh what's the next step?
B:	yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently.
M:	
B:	i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i don't think much of of life imprisonment. first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother. just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
M:	
B:	so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty so
M:	you
B:	yeah and and also um the the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell.
M:	
B:	and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
M:	i can't.
B:	and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened and and base the sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
M:	
B:	uh-huh
M:	i think he's in jail
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think he was uh uh.
B:	just started shooting people  because they botched the first job
M:	
B:	and  so now they're going to get even.
M:	you're and it's
B:	yeah.
M:	that's a bit weird
B:	uh-huh.
M:	u know stupid guys.
B:	yeah.
M:	it's the police officer.
B:	so what was the verdict what was the results there.
M:	you know the jury did their job they gave the guy a jury trial and the guy got out.
B:	oh.
M:	well he was accused of it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yea. i know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhhhh... huh?
B:	the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict.
M:	the the the penalty
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's uh not.
B:	yeah well you know you just have to decide you know well there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing.
M:	h
B:	and that i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
M:	i
B:	uh-huh
M:	you're.
B:	uh-huh.   yeah.  well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. i mean i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but it it's not worth somebody getting executed for. but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
M:	
B:	and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
M:	...
B:	and so i go these are the kind of people i would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society.
M:	.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i.
