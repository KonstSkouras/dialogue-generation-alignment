B:	do they have many buildings that have security there?
M:	n
B:	yeah, yeah, well i, i went to dallas, uh, when i worked for t i in abilene and, uh, i'm a little familiar with the city area, forest lane and, you know, through that, off, off the freeway.
M:	i?
B:	and, uh, it didn't seem like it was that congested in that, that part. you know because to me where we live out here in the north east, it, it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other,
M:	.
B:	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing, where there are more than one family in a house. and with the, uh, people that are coming into the country from other countries, not knowing the language
M:	
B:	and, uh, they're going to the big cities. it makes it very difficult.
M:	...
B:	it really does, and, and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about, uh, much more crime than ever before. drugs of course, uh, a big part of it i think.
M:	i'm not sure if i'm missing
B:	and, uh, i don't know, a lot of younger people, you know, into more violent crimes.
M:	uh, yeah.
B:	that, that's really sad, you know, you got young boys or girls, that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and, no remorse, what so ever.
M:	this, uh, reminds
B:	yeah.
M:	that's a pretty cool thing to do.
B:	it is and, and i don't know if it's, uh, the family, you know, thing where they're not bonding anymore, where mothers are working all the time and, the kids aren't getting the attention that they need, or the television.
M:	i don't think that's
B:	and i, i really think that we're, we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.
M:	i think you're right.
B:	uh, uh.
M:	i think that's a
B:	yeah, exactly.
M:	and it's, uh, prison.
B:	and, uh, you know, they had, uh, in fact on the news last night we were watching this, uh, man who lost his ten year old daughter. he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone. now ten years old, she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes, you know.
M:	youself
B:	and while he was gone, he had looked, went looking for a job and stopped at the store, that's what it was. and, uh, someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets, these two men, went in, raped the girl, murdered her, and the whole bit.
M:	you know
B:	and one of the men got, uh, i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for, uh, life imprisonment.
M:	this.
B:	the one that was in for the seventeen years, actually served seven, and he's out.
M:	he was in a time out
B:	and the man said, that, you know, if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail, that he would eliminate this person himself. and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing, think a thing about it.
M:	i don't think so.
B:	and i mean, i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands. and that innocent people,
M:	i think it's going to be a good
B:	i, i shouldn't say innocent, because i mean, actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but,
M:	well, the judge said
B:	the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it, you know, it's like two different things.
M:	what are you talking about?
B:	sometimes when you lose someone that you really love, you do some crazy things i don't know,
M:	i know, i've been there for a while.
B:	i, i like the idea that, uh, if someone is from a foreign country, and they come to this country and uh, commit, a crime, i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything, they should be immediately deported.
M:	so...
B:	especially if they're found guilty of the crime.
M:	if they are not convicted, then they are considered guilty.
B:	you know, once they, they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt, these people are guilty.
M:	no, but they are.
B:	that's it, we don't take care of them, we don't support them, nothing,
M:	so do we have a policy against those who don't know the crime?
B:	i mean they go right back where they came from.
M:	what? you mean the ones that were there before you?
B:	exactly and,
M:	they can't, because they're not a country.
B:	but that's, uh, they're, so close, i, i don't consider mexican people in the same category with, uh, especially like, uh, people who come from cultures that don't have the same, uh, kind of moral upbringing that we have.
M:	i'm sorry.
B:	like you take asian countries, or, uh, the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground, uh, in the background and the men are in the foreground,
M:	the, uh, foreground?
B:	and it's like, you know, um, they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago.
M:	it's
B:	you know, we've advanced beyond that, and i think that their, uh, mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing, you know what i mean.
M:	... but the men's bathroom?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm... i'm not sure, you know, how it works.
B:	yeah.
M:	
B:	wow.
M:	i.
B:	wow. you better believe it, if, you wouldn't even have to leave it, i mean,
M:	no
B:	it would get snatched right off your arm
M:	if you could just leave it in the car, it would be nice.
B:	oh sure.
M:	well, the only thing i would be afraid of is the possibility of a potential kidnapping if someone is there, and i wouldn't want to be in that situation.
B:	that's amazing, well, what's the difference there, do you know?
M:	well i am from texas and i can't believe i didn't think about
B:	oh, i, i believe in the death penalty, i really do.
M:	if you're not sure, you should be.
B:	yeah, yeah, i think that we're too easy.
M:	so is that the death sentence?
B:	uh, and we take the, the, uh, civil liberties, uh, stuff too far.
M:	i'm sorry, but i think we're all out of ideas here.
B:	you know like people that are in prison, i mean we didn't put them there. they put themselves in that situation.
M:	uhhh, like people who are in jail, uh, huh.
B:	and as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have.
M:	uhh, uh, interesting.
B:	i mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again.
M:	so what's the deal with them?
B:	i'm not saying they're all bad, but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes, do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives.
M:	well, if they are guilty, they are not bad people.
B:	i think that they should be put away.
M:	yeah, but they should have been.
B:	get rid of them. exactly. i, i really, i, i think that that's the whole key here. this plea bargaining baloney, where, uh, you know, they plead to a lesser crime, or, uh, they plead guilty in, or, you know, tell about someone else and they, they get less time,
M:	i, eh?
B:	or, if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior, for every year they're in they get so many less, you know, that they don't serve the full penalty.
M:	i'm
B:	i, i, i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
M:	h.
B:	yeah, same with drunk drivers.
M:	this is a great point.
B:	i think it's too easy for them.
M:	so you're saying there's a chance?
B:	that if the, the laws, and, and were, were harsher and were enforced,
M:	well i guess that's the law
B:	i mean you have to set an example. you have to start somewhere.
M:	this is what i'm saying.
B:	and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist, they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.
M:	they are in the uk
B:	an, it, an i feel bad for the policeman, because he's out there every day facing these people. this, this craziness, you know, people with, uh, automatic weapons and, uh, all this other stuff and trying to do a job
M:	ugh, that's the thing.
B:	and let's face it, what do they get paid.
M:	i think it's because the police are trained
B:	twenty thousand dollars a year, if they're lucky. i wouldn't do it for that.
M:	how much?
B:	it is, it really is. and i mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.
M:	is it legal to own a
B:	you know, and i'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,
M:	i don't like to talk about it
B:	but they, they're already, uh, have three strikes against them when they're out there.
M:	they're all the best, so that's all that matters.
B:	because they'll arrest someone and, you know, go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this, and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them, how you talk to them, uh, you know, what they say,
