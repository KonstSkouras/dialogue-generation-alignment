B:	oh
M:	you said you can do it.

M:	how long is the waiting time?
B:	oh, i don't know.
M:	but there is a reason why he isnt in the video
B:	right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
M:	i'm not sure what you mean
B:	well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
M:	you

M:	and you know, the police.
B:	right.
M:	we're still here, we're just waiting for them to be found.

M:	yeah, that's how i read it.
B:	and that may impact it as well.

B:	they don't think twice about it. yeah. either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
M:	they didn't think it was a big deal, they just didn't care.

B:	and they brought up what happened in killeen here recently, and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and t v and everything,
M:	it's the same in ireland, but the media are too busy talking about it.
B:	right, and then you get to their life story, oh, they came from a broken family
