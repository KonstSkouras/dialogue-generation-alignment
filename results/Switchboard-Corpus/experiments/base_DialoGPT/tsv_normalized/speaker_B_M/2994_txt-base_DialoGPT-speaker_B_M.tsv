B:	yeah. and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
M:	...
B:	you're supposed to what.
M:	i'm not sure about
B:	but what are you supposed to do with them. oh, okay.
M:	i've got it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't think you can recycle paper bags...
B:	yeah.
M:	well, i mean, they do have paper bags in them.
B:	we, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit and then we take them, take them in.
M:	i've never heard of that.
B:	yeah, we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,
M:	yeah, we don ', we're not a lot of people, but we're the people we are
B:	so, we generally don't have those to do.
M:	um, we don't, uh, we have them in the states
B:	you know, they, they charge you, you know, it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage.
M:	so, we're like the'do'thing, right?
B:	and i know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
M:	
B:	they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
M:	but it's still not the same as a recycling center.
B:	that that might be a better way to do it.
M:	you could use a yard sale or something.
B:	and then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
M:	they could just put a filter on it.
B:	you know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if i just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off.
M:	it's a bit of a dilemma.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	ya....
B:	oh, yeah that's about the same kind of thing.
M:	yeah.
B:	where do you live?
M:	i have a friend who can get me a bag
B:	oh, okay.
M:	not really, we are just in a big city. i'm in the suburbs.
B:	yes.
M:	are you in the us?
B:	it seems like they would be able to.
M:	why? do they have to pay you for the time they put you through the website?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	they could, but i don'know if it's possible.
B:	yeah.
M:	it's a thing.it's a thing.
B:	yeah.
M:	they are not really a company, just a bunch of guys in a small company.their website is just a website for them.and they make money.
B:	yeah, that's true .
M:	it's the recycling thing
B:	um, now i didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.
M:	i'm
B:	yeah.
M:	i know. but they taste good.
B:	okay.
M:	it's a nice place to recycle.
B:	okay.
M:	well i was just joking.
B:	all right, bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said, where were they
