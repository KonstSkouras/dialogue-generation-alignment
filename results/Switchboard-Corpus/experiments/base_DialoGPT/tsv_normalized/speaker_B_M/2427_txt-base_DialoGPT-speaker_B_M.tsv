B:	yeah. i have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four.
M:	i like to have a plan
B:	it's a long skinny one and
M:	i uh uh... i'm not sure how to word that.
B:	oh i see. yeah. i see.
M:	a lot of people do.
B:	right. right. yeah it's nice to get out in the open air.
M:	i know right. i like to fiddle around in my garage.
B:	and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever
M:	it's good
B:	but uh  sometimes i  i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know.
M:	well it's the only way.
B:	i grow a lot of things a lot of food.
M:	but uh you don't have to say that.
B:	and sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant. some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh squash or something  like that.  plant one of those
M:	i i i like plants.
B:	and it takes up your whole space
M:	i see. well uh...
B:	yeah. yeah. they they just run all over the place don't they
M:	i'm so
B:	right. right.
M:	yes. it's a good garden area.
B:	the basics. right. yeah. that's what we do too.
M:	i've been doing it.
B:	right. peas
M:	yeah. you can't really do that without the roots.
B:	i i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
M:	we do.
B:	the first one they started them indoors this time. i read it
M:	wait. did you just make them?
B:	and so i
M:	you know what i like?
B:	yeah. i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
M:	i'll be the one who grows.
B:	but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work.
M:	i can't even start a farm so it's just a farm
B:	because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered
M:	why would you want to do that?
B:	and i i don't think i'll do it again
M:	oh. i'm sorry
B:	oh yeah. yeah i enjoy it. i come home from work and and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and inspect it
M:	oh. yeah i've never been to a museum before.
B:	and the kids want to swing
M:	it's the same in the uk.
B:	and i push them on swing.
M:	i'll play with your hand
B:	and i i mow my own lawn.
M:	i i'm a grown up.
B:	and i do i don't have a sprinkler system. i i don't enjoy watering.
M:	i don't i'm not a robot.
B:	especially
M:	we do.
B:	oh how
M:	we have a water pump but it's not enough to power our water.
B:	oh.
M:	it's the best.
B:	yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning. and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about.
M:	i'm just kidding
B:	yeah. i i usually get it started for my wife
M:	that sounds great!
B:	and i and she moves it around ever other day.
M:	ah the of.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you don't have to it's a good habit.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	what do you do for a living?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh... what?
B:	yeah. sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of .
M:	i don't think i could ever get a lawn to go.
B:	but uh they want too much money.
M:	i don't know i don't have an excuse.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean it's not expensive.
B:	right. right. but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.
M:	because of the chemicals.
B:	right and the weed come up
M:	what do you mean?
B:	and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
M:	and now i'm in a good mood
B:	yeah.
M:	oh right.
B:	well if you  enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and and do it and stuff when you only have to
M:	i too enjoy it
B:	right.
M:	you're not limited you have to do it
B:	when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work.
M:	what's the time for?
B:	when they when they switch to switch
M:	when you when they switch
B:	when we get an hour more
M:	i can start working on it in an hour.
B:	when they rollback an hour.
M:	when they roll back an hour.
B:	i don't know.
M:	when will the patch be available?
B:	i really don't know. it just seems like i here it on the news the day before.
M:	they're still in the news.
B:	and uh i i think it's coming up here soon.
M:	yea i know.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	oh. well i think i heard something about it being on the website.
B:	are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden?
M:	i have no idea.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know.
B:	right. right. i i it seems like they come in spurts.
M:	ugh it's not good.
B:	one year i didn't put anything on and i didn't have any problems.
M:	uhhh you're not even on my list.
B:	next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they're called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever.
M:	how do you plant cabbage?
B:	they were just covered with them
M:	how did they get that?
B:	i mean i went up i didn't go out there for about three days you know because i and i went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem
M:	the plants.
B:	they devoured it that quickly.
M:	the plant was just covered in leaves it didn't even have a stem
B:	and they they have a you a good appetite
M:	they have a great sense of humor.
B:	and they would you know i i picked off like twenty of them and
M:	they have you know the...
B:	yeah.
M:	it's also they're just as much a threat to your crops as tomatoes.
B:	they got that uh what is that safer soap uh b t spray this year.
M:	the first rule of being a tomato is never to use soap.
B:	and i've been watching them every day and i've and i haven't seen any signs yet. so if i see any signs i'm going to spray them
M:	i've been doing that since the first week of july.
B:	and uh
M:	i've been seeing signs for years and i'm not even in the uk.
B:	right.
M:	hehehe. no
B:	well the good stuff. right.
M:	it's the best thing ever.
B:	right. yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up.
M:	so what about the wall?
B:	and uh i had sandy loam hauled in. i had a dump truck come and dump it.
M:	well that's just
B:	on my driveway i guess that's what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in.
M:	i guess they do that.
B:	but uh you know you can improve your own soil there
M:	right. so uh they'll fix it.
B:	but the texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil.
M:	that's the worst i've ever seen.
B:	right. and you know if i i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what i mean
M:	i know but you have no idea how much it cost to get it to grow
B:	uh-huh. do you have do you have a rotor tiller?
M:	i don't.
B:	small enough you have a just do it by hand?
M:	why???! why?
B:	yeah.
M:	... so?
B:	yeah.  yeah.
M:	oh? i think that was the last job i ever had.
B:	yeah. i'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines.
M:	i don't have one.
B:	and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that.
M:	that's a big yellow'a '.
B:	my neighbor across the street has one. he always uses it to dethatch his lawn
M:	you don't have a yard?
B:	i see him out there
M:	the dog is in the background.
B:	and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
M:	it's a sniper rifle.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	i see.
B:	i have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up
M:	how do you keep your phone unlocked?
B:	and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it.
M:	yeah i know.
B:	that would be nice.
M:	i'll have to look up how to do it
B:	uh-huh.
