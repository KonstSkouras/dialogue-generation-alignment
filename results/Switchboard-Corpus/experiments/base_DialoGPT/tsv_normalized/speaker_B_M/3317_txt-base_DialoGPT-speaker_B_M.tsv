B:	it is. have you been living there very long?
M:	that's very very true
B:	so you've been there longer. we built this one about uh it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago
M:	i was in the room for six months
B:	and we subcontracted it out ourselves. we bought the lot and uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
M:	so... we subbed on a lot of people who didn't even get a chance to make a decision.
B:	and then we subbed it out so we've been here a little over six years now. and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
M:	i'm sure they'll love it
B:	my husband got his big garage. he we have a three car garage that he has a big work area in
M:	how is it?
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and so he has all the work space he needs.
M:	i have a new car. i don't have a car.
B:	he
M:	hey. i don't know who you are.
B:	it is and that's why we decided to build. we looked at things that were already uh built
M:	why? it's not like the car is the only thing that's not being built.
B:	and the garages were always if the house was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
M:	yeah but the houses were large so the car was the size of the garage.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and the garaged houses are big and full of cars
B:	so we put a three car garage in.
M:	it's in the garage.
B:	but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space. all of it was taken up with just car space.
M:	i think they did have a garage.
B:	and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
M:	the garage is for work.
B:	well sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
M:	you know
B:	oh i see.
M:	this is the game where you
B:	uh-huh. well that's nice that it's not in your house.
M:	he does not.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you're not a bad guy.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	why because you know they have all of their stuff of their selves.
B:	right.
M:	uhh... why not?
B:	well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home.
M:	he sighs.
B:	and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
M:	... that's a good question.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
M:	we do.
B:	right. oh i understand
M:	i'm just trying to make the house fit in.
B:	well we that's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
M:	they're all gone
B:	well i i haven't reached that point yet. i've heard people say that. but uh my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
M:	heh that's good.
B:	he's out of college and has a good job
M:	why do you have a middle son?
B:	so he could afford to get married but is not engaged yet
M:	he doesn't know he's not married yet.
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
M:	uhh no.
B:	that's what she plans to do.
M:	so he can go to college.
B:	so i hope so.
M:	you can have my daughter if you want.
B:	oh ho-ho.
M:	it's not a problem.
B:	a whole new world. uh-huh.
M:	i am. i am.
B:	i can understand.
M:	the most interesting thing about me is that i have never been on acid.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	oh you've been there. i've been to the library.
B:	so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
