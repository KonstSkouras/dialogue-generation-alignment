M:	how do you think it would work?
B:	yeah yeah. i think that it probably would be a a good program. i think probably two years is too long.
M:	it's not a program it's a program.
B:	i think maybe a year would be the longest.
M:	how long would it take to train in the us?
B:	yeah and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
M:	it's the most popular place to go for a long time.
B:	yeah. so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
M:	i.
B:	yeah. right.
M:	i think you?
B:	right. college credit is a good idea because
M:	i think it's too late.
B:	right.
M:	college credit.
B:	that's right yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giving giving some kind of college credit
M:	oh so they're basically giving them money?
B:	no i don't think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not that familiar with them to know
M:	you know
B:	but you know if a a lot of people flat can't afford to.
M:	you
B:	you know
M:	because i think a lot people uh depends on how much money i have
B:	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into uh financial situations where they have to be working all the time.
M:	most people are young in a way.
B:	so it's it's a really tough question. that's right.
M:	i think they have.
B:	yeah
M:	well the kids in the uk are all working.
B:	and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that that postpones their college for a year
M:	why do you think they are a problem?
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too because they just want to get on
M:	you mean they have to go to school to get the grades they want to go into.
B:	yeah. i you know i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program
M:	so... would that make it a good idea?
B:	but i i think it can't be something that's mandatory.
M:	i think it's fine.
B:	it has to be something that's voluntary. you know which is pretty much the way it is now. they might
M:	but you can't make a choice to participate.
B:	yeah and that's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and uh you know go to the schools and do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh volunteer for such and such a time
M:	
B:	and you've a choice of where you want to go.
M:	i have some?
B:	and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
M:	what??!?
B:	yeah in their own community right. yeah that's true most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
M:	you.
B:	but they would have to be supported in some way and i'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
M:	i think
B:	right.
M:	are you serious?
B:	right exactly.
M:	i mean you could just sit around they don't have to pay you
B:	yeah it is tough. it's and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do.
M:	not sure if it's worth mentioning but this is a pretty tough one.
B:	yeah. yeah. i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.
M:	but... they can.
B:	you know it be it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.
M:	i'm sorry can you read thanks.
B:	they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.
M:	i would be surprised if they didn't.
B:	you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience get them all in the auditorium
M:	i've never heard of a group of people doing that.
B:	and you you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something
M:	yes.yes.and if they dont know they are just as bad as me.
B:	and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded
M:	i think you have the wrong subreddit.
B:	but they don't know where to go to to to do anything.
M:	because they're volunteers.
B:	yeah it is. it really is.
M:	i think that is the problem.
B:	right.
M:	it's the carter administration
B:	yeah yeah.
M:	but... you know... things like that.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think i know you.
B:	i don't either that's one
M:	i never thought i'd be in the minority on this one but i'm still a big fan of the program.
B:	yeah it is a tough question.
M:	but i have heard that there are no programs for it.
B:	sure same here.
M:	i have no idea what you mean by that.
B:	you too.
M:	have a good day!
B:	bye.
