B:	okay. go ahead.
M:	i know.
B:	yeah
M:	i mean i've seen people say that.
B:	that's true.
M:	they are the best.
B:	um me either. i i went to college and then started working and then got married and
M:	what about you?
B:	no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to uh teach in a small town down in south texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever.
M:	...
B:	uh-huh. if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live.
M:	
B:	yeah she only taught there one year but i
M:	how i'm
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah but she didn't get the credit
B:	and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and he was um some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that.
M:	i think it's the one where she teaches
B:	so you know if i think that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
M:	you know
B:	yeah. as far as yeah getting doctors and all that stuff yeah.
M:	
B:	yeah.
M:	oh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	oh. i think i'm gonna go with no.
B:	yeah.
M:	you can see the city.and the city is in the middle of the ocean.you know what i mean.it's not like we are going to get any new cities.but we have to go to the city.
B:	i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when
M:	i uh i don't.
B:	yeah. and don't they go into other countries and stuff?
M:	yeah they're called the peace corps.
B:	uh-huh. things that make the yeah. make them more self-supporting?
M:	how do they do that?
B:	yeah.
M:	yeah you?
B:	right. yeah.
M:	but we do have a program that does that.
B:	but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
M:	i don't think so
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you're kids.
B:	yeah.
M:	would it
B:	i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that
M:	maybe you can make a list of all the things that have been done in the past?
B:	i don't know that that would work if somebody's was didn't really want to be there and didn't have
M:	can we just have a mandatory season?
B:	yeah i mean there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
M:	i'd rather not have my way out of it.
B:	yeah.
M:	
B:	yeah.
M:	l
B:	uh-huh.
M:	oh there's a lot of people who are dying we're just losing some.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	people are still extinct point and figure
B:	right yeah.
M:	you're right.
B:	yeah uh-huh.
M:	it's a question but it's not really a question.
B:	yeah.
M:	i think the fact that they were so sad when they were kicked out of the country was a good example.
B:	yeah.
M:	they are all like friends.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean... you do have the peace corps though.
B:	well down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped.
M:	i know i'm not.
B:	yeah.
M:	no. it's not really a problem.
B:	and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the united states.
M:	north america
B:	there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know and i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be
M:	i
B:	yeah i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean  because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that
M:	...
B:	but.
M:	money
B:	yeah.
M:	i'm it's and
B:	or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
M:	i know what you mean. but if they're going to try to do that they should do it.
B:	i mean i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but.
M:	you're right.
B:	yeah i mean it's true. yeah.
M:	true. i'm not saying that the military is the only branch of the us government.
B:	yeah.
M:	that's true.
B:	flower mound yeah. so we're a little you know farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.
M:	ayehuh?
