B:	so i own a home in pensacola and uh let's see we are to compare homes. correct?
M:	well we are from the same state.
B:	uh my home is well is typical for the area. i live in a development uh it's a relatively i would say well god it sounds like sounds like i'm bragging
M:	okay. so you're not huh?
B:	but it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment.
M:	it's a place.
B:	it's a two story colonial which my wife and i designed.
M:	is that an old model?
B:	uh it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on
M:	... what's that?
B:	and it is i would imagine in terms of of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area. it might be i would say it's probably midsized for the area. there are some smaller and there are you know several larger.
M:	is it large?
B:	and uh but based you know in terms of you know in in pensacola in that area of florida it uh it's what now it is uh probably ten years old.
M:	that's uh uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don
B:	and so it's in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh the you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
M:	nope no
B:	but
M:	the house is in baltimore.
B:	i really haven't i really haven't uh when we built it ten years ago it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
M:	i
B:	so i i would have really i haven't really priced you know in the market so i
M:	what do you mean i have i i've been to you know the moon.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	how much money?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	... so what's the deal?
B:	i thought that was on the upswing again now.
M:	yeah it's not a huge deal.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but they are a part of the economy...
B:	yes.
M:	you mean like in dallas?
B:	uh-huh
M:	uh i think the economy is good so i'm not sure what's going on.
B:	well pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now
M:	i'd say the pensaclippers are the most expensive team in the state.
B:	and it isn't because of the well there has been a lot of speculative building. uh i don't know perhaps not in dallas
M:	i don't think it is. it's a fact.
B:	but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh pensacola is a navy town.
M:	i've never been to galvesto i'm just not sure if i would ever be in a navy ship.
B:	and home porting was a possibility a few years ago.
M:	well i'm in galvesto.
B:	they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy
M:	... i don't get it.
B:	a new carrier was coming in and uh the uh attendant uh support vessels. well that's no longer the case.
M:	... what was the plan?
B:	oh it's it is. i mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.
M:	you do realize that's not what they mean right?
B:	and so overbuilding is has been a real problem there.
M:	yeah the number is a bit high.
B:	so you can still get a get a a good house for a very very reasonable price. and i mean good i would let's say typical say three bedroom uh two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land uh reasonable construction would probably run you uh right now anywhere between somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood.
M:	500
B:	what about your home?
M:	well that's
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm sorry.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what's the rent like?
B:	nor do we but
M:	uhh i don t know
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm pretty sure the house was made in the 70's.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	hehuh.
B:	right.
M:	er uh
B:	well the housing here in maryland is just atrocious. and in in the entire d c area. i'm i'm only about uh twelve miles or so from the uh border of washington d c and montgomery county maryland is probably one of the most expensive places to
M:	?
B:	no we are west.
M:	you know?
B:	sevren is east near the eastern shore
M:	i don't get it.
B:	if i had
M:	i wouldn't
B:	uh-huh.
M:	sev ren?
B:	oh that's not unusual yeah.
M:	it's like a million dollars or something.
B:	well that's that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know washington area.
M:	the then.
B:	and so we uh i was just looking for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. and ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment.
M:	i'mverysmart
B:	now it was very nicely done.
M:	that was quite nice of you.
B:	i would have thought 
M:	that was the plan yes.
B:	yes. i i can't i can't envision spending that much money and on on something along those lines.
M:	did you not watch the video?
B:	so you know it's i guess you pay the piper but plus the the the taxes around here are phenomenally high.
M:	no i don't.
B:	uh for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on a on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in pensacola florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now
M:	i
B:	but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it.
M:	you probably.
B:	so it's uh so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower but the taxes would be you know perhaps maybe one-third uh of
M:	to that's a house
B:	oh absolutely. yeah
M:	oh i see. so if you don't mind me asking what
B:	so it's it's really sad
M:	well i'm not even a guy and i've been told it's a joke.
B:	this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.
M:	i'm in the uk. i'm not a citizen.
B:	well they it the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example. it has one of the best school systems in the country.
M:	why do you think they have so many problems?
B:	uh and because the cost of living around here is so high
M:	why is that?
B:	public employees make great salaries around here
M:	but i'm from the uk.
B:	i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the montgomery county public schools makes and i'm not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year.
M:	you don't know what a public employee is?
B:	that's
M:	i'm not i'm a private school teacher.
B:	and i by administrator i i think i mean i they didn't they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone you know in that uh in that range.
