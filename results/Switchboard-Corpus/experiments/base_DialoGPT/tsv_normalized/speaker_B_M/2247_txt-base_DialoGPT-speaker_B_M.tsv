B:	it's eighty eighty-eight?
M:	you're a joke.
B:	okay. uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? word processing obviously.
M:	the only thing that's different is that it's an english based site.
B:	okay. uh, i use them both here at work and at home.
M:	i don't know what you're talking about.
B:	and i have i b m clones in both cases.
M:	uhh, what do you mean?
B:	here at work i have the t i one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
M:	there's a t i clone in the box that's the same thing.
B:	yes, it is. uh, unfortunately i need all of it.
M:	is the gx clone a clone?
B:	uh, for example, i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
M:	this is how you get a million people to download it.
B:	and that, i know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
M:	i'm sorry, i'm not sure what you're asking.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. just in the ability to handle.
M:	well, it was a good game.
B:	and then i have, uh, a three eighty-six f x a sixteen bit machine, at home.
M:	you have, uh, a twelve inch machine, in your bedroom.
B:	and i'm really pleased with it.
M:	uhhh... so you've never heard of it?
B:	it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
M:	i'm really, uh, impressed with it.
B:	uh, what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. have you,
M:	that's what i'm thinking.uhh, what about the tools for word processing?
B:	to try to make them more effective and useful.
M:	um... um... what?
B:	have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
M:	yeah. i've been struggling along that line lately.
B:	well, i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it. it's, uh, i used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
M:	...
B:	the, at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that. of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. not a fun thing to try to recover from.
M:	
B:	very frustrating. uh, but again i've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. uh, that was a engineering spec on b two. you come here with the b level of specs?
M:	this.
B:	well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. uh, to one level down from assistant description.
M:	i'm.
B:	well, i sure need them. uh, there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to, to try to do my job without them.
M:	
B:	yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. i think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. when you start seeing what all they can do for you.
M:	what
B:	well, i understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
M:	you.
B:	right.
M:	i was thinking of the future.
B:	uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
M:	i'm pretty sure the original was released in 2003, and the original version was released just a few months after.
B:	it does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
M:	yeah, but it's been out for a while now.
B:	but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	i'ma
B:	well, okay. i enjoyed our discussion.
M:	you're right, i was just thinking of it in a different way.
B:	you do the same.
M:	ah, well, you don't know me.
B:	bye.
