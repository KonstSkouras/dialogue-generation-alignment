B:	so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year.
M:	what?
B:	uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.
M:	oh. okay.
B:	then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
M:	she had her car in the driveway.
B:	uh
M:	she's a lot like you.
B:	well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke. it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore.
M:	was she?
B:	and she got kind of fearful of being on her own. she never really ate very well. it was one thing. she hardly  ever took care of herself
M:	ugh.
B:	and she didn't eat. she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of it. and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore.  so
M:	i.
B:	um.
M:	what's wrong with that?
B:	well she was almost ridiculous. like she'd eat ice cream and cookies.  she'd
M:	i'd
B:	didn't one
M:	she had a lot of self control
B:	oh really?
M:	you're not the only one
B:	well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.
M:	he's not a cook.
B:	oh that's too much trouble. that's too much trouble. didn't want to cook.
M:	i'm sorry
B:	yeah.
M:	ahh you know the recipe?
B:	although they've got uh meals on wheels  which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat.
M:	yeah the food is pretty good.
B:	no i don't think there was. um i know a little bit more from a a co-worker. her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.
M:	oh.
B:	um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care. uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory  so they  were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.
M:	h
B:	but i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the arkansas house i think out in arlington something like that.
M:	yeah what?
B:	and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom. all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
M:	uh.
B:	they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know  as a just you know half
M:	i like how you
B:	uh so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. very limited space waste
M:	what?
B:	but um at least they all seem to have uh you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room  and and eat some good meals.
M:	food.
B:	i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean very antisocial. maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but
M:	i'm so sorry
B:	yeah i don't understand  that they they don't want to be with anybody else.
M:	you uh you
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what are they can and are
B:	yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in pennsylvania they live in alabama. and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and you have women like that
M:	i'm um um?
B:	i don't to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that  whole i mean
M:	you have they you
B:	they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it.
M:	what do they do?
B:	uh.
M:	i'm soooo done with you
B:	um.
M:	so uh how do you do it?
B:	but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that
M:	why?
B:	because i i think what do you have there? it's a house
M:	i have no idea what you're talking about.
B:	it's walls  and it's furniture but  there's nobody there.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	don't you want to be close to me? i mean you know  be with other people.
M:	you don't have to be alone we can't have it.
B:	i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in  that building.
M:	so why are they so hostile?
B:	and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house.
M:	you mean the family house?
B:	yeah.
M:	no.they're not.
B:	that's from the child's standpoint. the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family.
M:	i don't really care. i just want to know.
B:	what does that house got attraction?
M:	i don't know.
B:	i know they're really proud of independence.
M:	why do they hate us?
B:	uh.
M:	why? what's the point?
B:	well when she got home who took care of her?
M:	i'm not sure if she'll be home soon.
B:	oh.
M:	you can be her caregiver.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know.
B:	um
M:	it's not like she's going to get out of bed or anything.
B:	yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in college station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the dallas area and there's nothing to hold them there in college station since they're retired.
M:	that's nice but i'm not sure if you can find a place to stay in dallas
B:	so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
M:	i don't know.
