B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm just going to assume you mean in the city
B:	i think so too. i'm in texas
M:	... is it a thing?
B:	and very few people carpool
M:	uhh not really.
B:	uh the people that i know don't want to because uh they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
M:	i've seen people do it but i don't think it's the same.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	what if you're the
B:	that's right. and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
M:	you.
B:	but uh you know i i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
M:	we don't know.
B:	but
M:	well i think it's going to be a lot more expensive than the new car.
B:	well my other line is ringing
M:	i'm sorry i'm not sure i think it's a very good line
B:	but we're going to ignore it
M:	i don't think you know what a spoiler is.
B:	i'm sorry for these beeps
M:	beep beep beeps
B:	oh close to five minutes i believe.
M:	the thing i'm not sure.
B:	and you're in minneapolis
M:	i don't understand are you in the room?
B:	well is the pollution really bad up there?
M:	there's a lot of pollution down there
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	i know.
B:	yeah
M:	and there's no pollution.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	yay! another day of being
B:	well that's the way it has gotten here.
M:	i think you
B:	we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in texas
M:	i don't know i'm from the uk and i've never seen a single thing about it.
B:	but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
M:	i think it would be a good policy.
B:	and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed
M:	no it's just a bad solution.
B:	and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
M:	i think so
B:	uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
M:	i guess they can just build a new one with a few more people.
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
M:	uhhhh. you're not gonna get away with this.
B:	therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
M:	i'm pretty sure the costs of replacing a broken unit is covered by the warranty.
B:	and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems you know
M:	
B:	but
M:	it's like the freon
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	yeah uh i'm sorry.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhhh. yes
B:	um.
M:	uhhh yeah uh but...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uuh why?
B:	it's probably happened to millions of people
M:	yeah i know but i don t know if it has happened to other people.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	it is in fact the only thing that is not free is the service station.
B:	uh-huh
M:	u ronan i've got a feeling that it's gonna increase in value.
B:	yeah.
M:	well you can get it for a dollar so...
B:	inhaled so much of it uh-huh.
M:	you're supposed to inhale it.
B:	yeah well of course in the uh i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt
M:	m
