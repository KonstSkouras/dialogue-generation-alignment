B:	so, social changes aren't that much for me either.
M:	no, i'm fine.
B:	well, yeah, that.
M:	i can remember my youth
B:	i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
M:	not in the last century.
B:	uh-huh, relaxed and laid back and stuff
M:	i guess.
B:	and.
M:	and
B:	i think so.
M:	well, it's not like they're doing anything.
B:	i think so, and a lot, i think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
M:	oh, okay. so, what's it like?
B:	right.
M:	yeah.right.
B:	yeah, i think so. i think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
M:	i
B:	and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
M:	i think you mean like pro prochoice.
B:	i think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
M:	and then you have the stigma of prochoice
B:	no, huh-uh.
M:	huh. huh.
B:	right. well, i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
M:	i was
B:	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
M:	no,
B:	but, i'm not, i'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
M:	i'm not, i'm just being a naive person
B:	it wasn't that long that i was that young.
M:	oh, well... i mean...
B:	and i've got a ten year old, and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms, and and he knows about aids,
M:	you can't have kids if you don't have a sense of humor.
B:	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
M:	you have to tell me about what you have.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	that's what i said.
B:	no, i don't, i think that's stupidity on parents' part. i mean that's, sex is rampant,
M:	no, you're just
B:	and it always will be, and and i think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
M:	i'm so sorry.
B:	i mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all i have is boys, so that's all i'm around basically, is boys,
M:	i know,
B:	but they talk about things that i, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
M:	that's all of the good stuff
B:	and, and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer.
M:	you know, you just say, uh, it's cool, i'm not like that, you know?
B:	you can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, cabbage patch answers and stuff.
M:	how do i get the answers to my questions?
B:	they, they, that just does not go.
M:	and if you do not get the answer, you are, i am, i, i.
B:	and they can tell me, basically some things that i don't know
M:	that's why they have the cabbage patch, and you can see the cabbages.
B:	but it, it's interesting, listening to them. i think, i think the social changes in them, i think i see it more with that generation than i do with like our generation.
M:	what? i'm just kidding.
B:	yeah, i do too.
M:	...
B:	i know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
