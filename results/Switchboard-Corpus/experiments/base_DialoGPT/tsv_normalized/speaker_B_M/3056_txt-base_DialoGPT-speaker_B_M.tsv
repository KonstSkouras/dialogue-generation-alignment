M:	you've uh never read it huh?
B:	oh i do not remember the man's name he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the new york times or the washington post one of the two and he supposedly got this this story uh i mean this uh was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the uh corporate headquarters in uh in los angeles.
M:	?
B:	they on i think it was romain drive or romain street or something there in los angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a uh you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of everything he he he did not he did not throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh and had ended up
M:	yeah..that.who
B:	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from hughes to uh to his main uh main assistant back uh in the fifties and well i guess in the sixties up until his death.
M:	you?.yeah' bout..??whatmanshipmanship
B:	so it's pretty interesting work so
M:	3
B:	yeah it's a it's a little it's a little hard you have to plod through it and you know it does not have a real story or any plot
M:	i
B:	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
M:	it's a book so...
B:	no i have not seen it. but it's but it is it is real interesting
M:	have you seen the movie?
B:	uh i also reading uh the uh it's a an old another old book that i happen to have. i am sort of rereading it. it's uh a book about uh the bermuda triangle but it's uh it's about it's a real good book that a guy uh wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote uh sort of debunking many of the uh uh the stories about the uh bermuda triangle. you know he he was thinking many many of the the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained
M:	
B:	and you know. uh and the reason i was picked it back up was in light of all the uh well when they found the uh the airplanes on the in the atlantic thinking they were flight nineteen. and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's uh flight nineteen was one of the uh was a a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two and they were they were lost and uh
M:	
B:	yeah they were.
M:	
B:	and so and in the book you know even he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. and uh because he he mentions he he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth. and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
