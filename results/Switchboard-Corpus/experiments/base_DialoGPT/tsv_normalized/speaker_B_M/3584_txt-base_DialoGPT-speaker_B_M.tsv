B:	uh and it's uh i guess what they call a story and a half. because it's not a full two story. where you know everything on top is on bottom.
M:	it's a.me '
B:	so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
M:	we do.
B:	and uh it's about a five year old house now.
M:	ah uh it's a story.
B:	it's uh pretty nice. unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
M:	so uh what's it like?
B:	yeah. it was a landmark is the one who built it.
M:	i know who you are.
B:	yeah. that's true.
M:	it's a pretty nice place to live but you can't live there forever.it's a paradise.for now.
B:	exactly what happened to them.
M:	i think you mean that's what happened with the germans.
B:	oh that's nice.
M:	they are all home made.
B:	oh really.
M:	it's going to be a fire.
B:	are you doing it yourself?
M:	i don't think i can afford to buy a house with all that.
B:	wow.
M:	not much.
B:	oh that's nice.
M:	yeah. it's nice.
B:	oh i see. huh.
M:	he was a builder.

B:	that's great.
M:	yes we do.
B:	is that so?  i didn't know that.
M:	yeah. i mean i could build a home.
B:	well that sounds kind of dumb.
M:	because it's a loan and you can borrow money from people to build houses.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think it's just for the sake of it.
B:	yeah.  yeah.
M:	it's a bank so it has to be a bank.
B:	huh.
M:	it's a bag.
B:	that's right
M:	i've got a few of those.
B:	yeah that's true.
M:	you can't really save the money you can only borrow it.
B:	uh-huh. that's good.
M:	it's not a bad place just a little busy
B:	yeah.  how big a lot do you got it on?
M:	i do!
B:	wow. that's nice. that's real nice.
M:	i live in a small town in the middle of nowhere.
B:	oh.
M:	yeah. it is.
B:	god. that's pretty good.
M:	i'm at the top of the hill.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	the weather is pretty cool.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	are you talking about me?
B:	oh that's pretty good.
M:	yes. yes.
B:	uh-huh. oh you you you don't plan on putting any any of that in?
M:	i'm not planning on putting anything in it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	oh well i'm not planning on putting anything in there.
B:	yeah.
M:	uhh uh i think you mean a wood stove.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	we'll use wood burning stoves of course.
B:	wow.
M:	it's not too bad.but i've had to put my laptop in the hot tub to keep it warm.
B:	yeah. that's pretty good.
M:	it's not the heat.
B:	yeah.
M:	a lot of them.
B:	wow.
M:	it's the eastside.
B:	my wife would love that
M:	i'd love to see a picture of a glass window.
B:	she loves lots of windows. that's great.
M:	i know she's like a million times more beautiful than i am.
B:	is it a single story?
M:	is that a single window?
B:	oh i see.
M:	it's a window.
B:	uh-huh. um i see.
M:	is it just me or is the second story on the left a bit high?
B:	oh.
M:	it's a bit of a joke.
B:	yeah.
M:	huh.
B:	uh-huh. yeah that's kind of like like a victorian style?
M:	it's a little like a store in the middle of the street i think.
B:	yeah. i i've always liked that. the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back.
M:	i think that's the one.
B:	but you know i i see these magazines where you know dig your your own deck.
M:	it's a big problem isn't it?
B:	i i kind of wish i had them those size property and and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck.
