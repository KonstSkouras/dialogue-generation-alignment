B:	oh.
M:	yeah. i'm sorry.
B:	oh, wow.
M:	it's an old car.
B:	well, i really, the last car we got was a, was a used car. i really don't prefer buying a new car. i like to let somebody else pay for that
M:	i'm not sure i'd ever buy a used vehicle, especially a used one.
B:	but, uh mine was a year old,
M:	well, i've got a new one for you.
B:	and we bought it for very functional purposes,
M:	that's not the point of the post
B:	and that was we bought a station wagon. we wanted an economical car to operate,
M:	uhh... no, they don't.
B:	but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment. so, we chose a nissan stanza wagon.
M:	uuhuh. why?
B:	and i've never been sorry,
M:	i've been sorry
B:	however the need for that kind of car has changed now,
M:	i'm sorry.
B:	and, uh, while it is still good, and it's quite serviceable, and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable.
M:	and, while it's still good, it's not reliable.
B:	and probably then some i'll spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up.
M:	ugh. i'm sorry, but i don't think it's worth the trouble.
B:	i think that i would like to, if you know, we all say, if i could have the car i always wanted i would either buy a nissan maxima, uh,
M:	you're just asking for it.
B:	i'm sold on nissans.
M:	a nissan is not the best car.
B:	i a or, or foreign cars actually. uh,
M:	what about?
B:	uh,
M:	i like the nissan.
B:	its reliability.
M:	i have never heard that.
B:	its reliability. and, uh, i, you know, i've read all the consumer reports and things, and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars. if ford was a head and the shoulders above it, i'd buy a ford.
M:	but... but... but ford...
B:	but i had, uh, had a ford escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it.
M:	and you had a pontiac aztek in the 80's.
B:	uh, you know, i mean it was ready for the graveyard.
M:	it's not like i had a chance to say that, it's just
B:	and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car.
M:	i spent a lot of time on that game.
B:	so,
M:	but, you know, i was.
B:	and that was just trying to hold us, getting out of that was a used car.
M:	well, it's not like we have a choice.
B:	and it was an older car,
M:	i think you have a problem
B:	but, you know, escort is supposed to have a great track record as far as sales.
M:	i don't think they'll be cheap. i'd rather have a car with a great history than a car that's been abused and abused for years.
B:	but it's just, it just was not and you get stung a time or two,
M:	but you know, it was a car
B:	and you say, no thanks.
M:	it's not a scam, it's a deal
B:	so, i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto, uh, reports
M:	yeah. i got it from a consumer.
B:	had my son who knows a lot about that, study them thoroughly, and he gave me four choices of cars to buy
M:	i think you're confusing this with the car he bought.
B:	an escort definitely was not among them. in fact, there wasn't an american car in there.
M:	i got an'04 mustang. i think the best car i've ever owned was a nissan gt r.
B:	uh, the nissan came and, and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get.
M:	awwww. my nissan.
B:	but it served our needs. uh, later on his reports, the reports that he studied showed that, uh, nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the in the class that we were looking for. and that, and i'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac. i really would. it's not necessarily prestige,
M:	i'm so tired.
B:	but it's comfort. uh, there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car. uh,
M:	uhhh
B:	nissan.
M:	what is the difference between a ford gt and
B:	no. no, no. nissan is japanese.
M:	no. no. no.no.no.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh,
M:	japanese nissan?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	
B:	yeah. and, uh, if i couldn't have my luxury maxima then i'd buy me a fancy little red c r x sports car
M:	uhuhuh. you know, if you can't afford a ferrari, you don't have to.
B:	i mean, you know, every every one of us have two sides
M:	so you have two cars?
B:	yeah.  now what about you, if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get
M:	yeah, but i can't afford it.
B:	and why?
M:	but... you can't have the cat
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what?
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. yeah.  see there,
M:	yeah. um.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	uhh... uh... uh?
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. i tell you that's sad too because there one time ford was the best, that was made.
M:	uuhuhuh. uuhuh uhuhuh
B:	really was.
M:	it was
B:	and, uh, i, i really have not seen, now a lot of the american cars actually are, are, parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa.
M:	i, uh, i, uh
B:	of course.
M:	are you interested in the car?
B:	okay uh, at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you would be looking for?
M:	no, i'm fine. i'm just not looking for anything specific.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	hmmm, you?
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. yeah. oh, wow. we like the stuff that glitters
M:	uh, yes.
B:	good. there's nothing wrong with that. actually i think probably if i were going to get if i were going to be practical, which doesn't mean i would be,  i would prefer white. because, simply because it's more visible at night.
M:	um... uh... yeah.
B:	and, uh-huh. uh-huh. now the interior, okay, i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red.
M:	uh
B:	but if i had the little red c r x , i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that. and if i got the c r x it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too.
M:	huh
B:	i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
M:	
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, i can go back and talk to my friends.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm in the same boat. i'm going to hang out with my mom.
B:	that's okay.
M:	um.huh.
B:	no, no, no. i generally would uh, prefer to listen to, uh, well, i listen to k c b i a lot but i will listen to the news and the, and the traffic and those things at work.
M:	okay, um, i'll be here.
B:	but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time, i want some real good classical music.
M:	hmmm. uh, i dunno.
B:	i love classical music, and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the, all the characteristics of the instruments.
M:	
B:	so i do love classical music or it or, or, uh, contemporary classical.
M:	what do you love about classical music?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what is this, a crossover episode?
B:	sure do.
M:	oh, hey.
B:	w r r and the oasis are the two that i listen to, more than anything else.
M:	do you listen to anything else?
B:	and i do like them. and i'd like to have a compact disc player in the car. that would be,  something that i would really like.
M:	i'd like the oasis
B:	those compact discs,  really are good for cars because they don't melt,
M:	i like the ones that come with the ones i bought.
B:	they don't warp.
M:	i have a nice compact disc, i love it. i don't think it is worth the price.
B:	you know, there's nothing in there that can wrap around the, the, uh, rollers or anything. it seems like a really good answer to portable music, that you can choose.
M:	i've never heard of this before, but i can't help but wonder what it is.
