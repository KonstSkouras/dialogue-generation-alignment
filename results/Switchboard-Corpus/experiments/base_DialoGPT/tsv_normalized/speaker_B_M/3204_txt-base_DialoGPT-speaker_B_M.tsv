M:	yea, i'm a nurse.
B:	right.
M:	i think he's talking about the other kids
B:	oh, it's very difficult i know.
M:	yeah, it's hard for me too.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	uhm... what?
B:	right.
M:	it's unrealistic.
B:	yeah.
M:	ohhh uh
B:	yeah, how old is she?
M:	yeah, she's cool.
B:	uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
M:	oh. well, how old are you?
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, i don't know what i'll do up there.
M:	i'm sorry.
B:	i, i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
M:	i, uh, i'm not a nurse, i just do, uh... i don'know, uh.
B:	they're in missouri and i could, i, i know, i know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. most of them.
M:	are you from missouri?
B:	and, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
M:	i know, it's so sad
B:	so,
M:	they're, uh, sad.
B:	right.
M:	yeah. i'm not a big fan of them either.
B:	yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
M:	well, if you can afford it, i think you can handle a little.
B:	so, uh, i mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
M:	no, i mean like, i'm not the only one
B:	i would imagine that i'll, uh, if something happens, i'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
M:	if anything happens, i'll.
B:	so, uh,
M:	he's a little short for me, but i'm not a big fan of him.
B:	but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but i think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
M:	i don't think you can really say that, unless i'm missing something.
B:	but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
M:	well i don't think i can say i have ever had to talk to anyone.
B:	i think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	and so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
M:	you just need to drop into the nurse home, and you will find them.
B:	they never go to see them.
M:	how many people do you know who don't have their own.
B:	i've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe christmas.
M:	and if they are in the hospital, they go.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	awwwwwwwww nursing homes.
B:	right.
M:	yeah. but i'm not sure.
B:	oh, i do too.
M:	yes, i do.
B:	or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
M:	or when the parents are real
B:	uh, because i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
M:	you, uh, i know.
B:	so.
M:	he was the governor of california.
B:	anyway.
M:	well, that's good.
B:	right. oh, it's tough i'm sure.
M:	she nods.
B:	oh. right, that would be devastating i'm sure so.
M:	they'd have to have the family or friends to have any good care.
B:	it is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
M:	what if i don
B:	yeah.
M:	so, uh, if you don't feel you could do that then...
B:	right.
M:	well, i'm not sure what you're asking, but i don't think you need any help.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yup. they are there.
B:	right.
M:	like a... father?
B:	i would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
M:	i don't know, i'm hoping we could get a third person to do it, but i'm not sure.
B:	well, anyway,
M:	... yeah
B:	we've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
M:	you're welcome, but i think you've covered my answer too well.
B:	have a good,
M:	he smiles and hugs her again thank you
B:	have a good
