B:	i kind of i think so too. i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it's it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can.
M:	i etc.
B:	yeah.
M:	i'm not saying it's okay.i just think it is a little too
B:	your right i do too i think they start out young like in uh girl scouts and boy scouts a video doing
M:	i do
B:	right that's see that's what we did in girl scouts and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
M:	i.
B:	something
M:	
B:	yeah.
M:	they are?
B:	i do too. i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that. and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know helping helping out. i think that's good and
M:	well.
B:	yeah  yeah.
M:	we
B:	yeah there you go.
M:	you
B:	right.
M:	i'm just kidding.
B:	yeah it sounds pretty good that sounds good. i've noticed a lot of uh different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat. they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over
M:	i like that uh thing
B:	and they clean it up.
M:	it's called a garage
B:	and keep it clean. i think that's i pretty good idea. and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older. i know i did you know in girl scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
M:	
B:	so oh.
M:	hahaah. i'm... it's ice and ice.
B:	yeah i'm in texas. where are you at?
M:	oh??
B:	new york.
M:	where are you from?
B:	oh gosh.
M:	yeah i'm from the us
B:	yeah.
M:	is this upstate new york?
B:	yeah
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	uh-huh.  oh no.
M:	yeah. and there's a bunch of trees in rochester.
B:	oh.
M:	i'm back.
B:	golly.
M:	ah so it was.
B:	are you serious?
M:	it's been on the internet for over a week now.
B:	oh my god  how do they live?
M:	i have a feeling that they'll be back soon.
B:	yeah. i haven't heard a thing.
M:	is there any news about this?
B:	lord.
M:	it's been a few days since the last earthquake
B:	well that's good.  that's great.
M:	we're on the ground floor of a major hospital in the uk
B:	right.   yeah.
M:	i think it's good
B:	right.
M:	right.
B:	and we go along and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can.
M:	i'm not sure i understand what you're trying to say.
B:	yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat. i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps.
M:	is
B:	uh yeah. they uh luckily we have a a man who owns a building company.
M:	they do it
B:	so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material. then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
M:	how does he what do you do?
B:	yeah. and it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out.
M:	i don't get it.
B:	so it's real neat.
M:	i am not sure what is happening.
B:	it's   yeah
M:	so what is this?
B:	it's  like i say it's not a lot but it helps people. like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and i just you know just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
M:	how do you do that?
B:	and you know if you can do any a little bit it helps so
M:	i uh don't know.
B:	yeah.
M:	so what you want to do is it like a hug?
B:	yeah.
M:	i'm sorry i didn't mean to be mean.
B:	gosh. that's great. that's a lot.
M:	a lot.
B:	that's that's a lot of kids though.
M:	a good chunk of my school participated.
B:	oh well still that's a you know that's a good chunk of kids.
M:	that is that's not a good thing.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh well i mean it's a small town.
B:	yeah.  that's neat.
M:	it's really really neat.i know of people who would buy it.
B:	that's great.
M:	i got involved with it.it was a dance dance a group of people were dancing.
B:	that's great. but uh like i'll agree with you though i don't think they should have to do a year
M:	it's a pretty good way to get into a lot of trouble.
B:	yeah. i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean. they're not worth it
M:	i'm not sure. maybe it's just a year or two in the academy.
B:	right. oh yeah that's true that's true.
M:	you can't you?
B:	oh.
M:	nah.
B:	i couldn't either.
M:	you know i'm not sure.
B:	i couldn't either.
M:	oh.oh
B:	right  right.
M:	he's the best and he's the worst.
B:	yeah. i just know one person that's in the peace corps and i mean she's a teacher and and just wanted to do it. she'd been a teacher for a while. just decided she wanted to do it so. i mean i'm grateful for people like that but i don't see how they can just yeah
M:	what?
B:	just pick up and head on out.
M:	i mean i'm not sure what i could do.
B:	i wish i could do something like that but i can't so
M:	yeah but it's not a problem
B:	right that's the way i am.  i know the feeling.
M:	i'm sorry but i don't think i can do that.
B:	that's right we're against it that's right.
M:	well i mean i've never voted for a government that didn't.
B:	you too and i hope everything works out up there.
M:	i hope so too.
B:	yeah.
M:	so i'm still here right?
B:	good good that's great. yeah. well good luck.
