B:	well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
M:	i'm not even sure who the cowboys are anymore.
B:	at least they're coming around.
M:	the cowboys are gonna win the super bowl this year.
B:	well i mean you know i think uh once jimmy johnson gets his system established uh they'll do all right.
M:	they're just playing the game.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and the bears.
B:	i'm a viking fan.
M:	why do you hate the packers?
B:	and they haven't been doing too hot so.
M:	they're playing the patriots not the jets.
B:	no in fact in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal.
M:	he was the best player on the cowboys for a long time.
B:	i've never been over impressed with him.
M:	the cowboys have been over hyped for a long time.
B:	well who's the running is it sammy smith or is it emmett smith.
M:	that
B:	emmett smith.
M:	i'm still he was a bit of course.
B:	yeah.
M:	he's not that good
B:	i'm not sure.
M:	is he?
B:	who else is uh oh there's you know mike  minnesota vikings used to be the general manager starting the world football league.
M:	what??!?! i'm sorry.
B:	so and and he was trying to keep uh uh i can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the vikings.
M:	what?
B:	jerry burns.
M:	i can't think of a more iconic name than jerry.
B:	he was going to keep him as the coach somehow but uh i don't know i'd like to see the vikings get revamped somehow.
M:	that's a good idea.
B:	well they started out really bad they went like one and six and then they won five or six in a row.
M:	they're not that bad.
B:	so they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
M:	they won the super bowl and went 6 6.
B:	yeah i guess you can
M:	you can't you can't win a super bowl in a season.
B:	yeah.
M:	the vikings are going to the playoffs.
B:	and the cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the cowboys and the cowboy cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys so.
M:	you mean the nfc south.
