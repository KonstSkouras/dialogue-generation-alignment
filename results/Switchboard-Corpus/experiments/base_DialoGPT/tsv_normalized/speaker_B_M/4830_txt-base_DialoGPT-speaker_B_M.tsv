B:	right.
M:	i know that the jury decides.
B:	right. there's there this topic is kind of mute. uh
M:	what do you mean?
B:	there there's no way. we we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
M:	right.
B:	uh one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
M:	they are.
B:	uh every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. uh.
M:	we don't.
B:	right.
M:	
B:	right. they shouldn't allow an appeal.
M:	i'm a'there's.
B:	yep.
M:	can't be legal.
B:	uh-huh
M:	what is?
B:	oh that's right. i work for a law firm
M:	i was at the school.
B:	right.
M:	the lawyers have been involved in a lot.
B:	well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
M:	because it's the only option available to them.
B:	plea bargaining is something completely different. that that actually prevents trials. or at least speeds them up.
M:	if they get a plea bargain then they can be charged with assault.
B:	right.
M:	i mean the whole system is broken. that's why they're doing it.
B:	right.
M:	it's a law
B:	huh.
M:	they don't.
B:	right.
M:	... but we do have capital penalty.
B:	we do
M:	why don't we have capital punishments?
B:	right.
M:	i think they're both guilty
B:	right. when you're saying as far as the appeal uh procedure was concerned.
M:	it's not that they're not guilty. it's that they aren't guilty.
B:	we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry.
M:	i'm not sure i've never heard of the appeal.
B:	uh his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up
M:	uh what?
B:	so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession.
M:	no he's a minor.
B:	but uh that was absurd  there is never there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
M:	he was on probation.
B:	well uh the the only i can i you know the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of. uh like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd.  there's no way that could work.
M:	the appeal
B:	uh but
M:	it's
B:	oh exactly.
M:	i i don t know.
B:	exactly.  right.
M:	it's not about feeling good. it's about feeling happy.
B:	no one would want the job
M:	what if i told you i would want to do this for a living.
B:	uh and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case.
M:	i know.the majority do
B:	oh yeah. i i feel that everyone is everyone is uh entitled to a trial by jury.  that that that right
M:	i am uhh i'm not.
B:	well i mean were there witnesses?
M:	i don't think so.
B:	right.  right.  that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
M:	i know i'm saying that you can
B:	i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
M:	i was thinking of a different scenario.
B:	and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances
M:	there's only so many people you can watch in jury duty.
