B:	oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be.
M:	ah yeah i'm gonna try it. i don't know what i'm doing right now but...
B:	right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents.
M:	i'm not saying there's not uh there's a lot of people
B:	right. so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting.
M:	i don't think so.right.it.is.n
B:	and it's it's they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote.
M:	... and it's and and
B:	right.
M:	right. so uh why do you?
B:	right. the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	oh i know it the last gubernatorial race was oh it was awful.
M:	we're talking about texas not texas.
B:	so i don't know i i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go.
M:	yea. it was a terrible race
B:	yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse.
M:	i'm not sure i've been pretty depressed about the last few years.
B:	you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote then you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things.
M:	i know. i'm just saying.
B:	uh-huh. right uh yeah we can get uh yeah if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes that they were you know had enough pull.
M:	so i mean you you
B:	yes. uh-huh.
M:	ku.
B:	yeah and uh who's the other guy larouche that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe.
M:	 you uh uh
B:	yeah lyndon larouche that's it.
M:	is that the guy who was in the newsroom of the
B:	and uh yeah.
M:	yes yea.that's
B:	uh-huh.
M:	ohh that guy
B:	right. if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say look you know this guy's got everything together.
M:	i can't. i'm a democrat.
B:	you know i like what he says and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
M:	he's been in power for over a year.
B:	and uh i think that's sort of what happened with louisiana because because um the guy did get elected correct?
M:	i don't
B:	that's what i thought.
M:	i mean the guy was a senator in louisiana
B:	and uh  but you know they can always fool us you know. he might do a good job.
M:	he's a good candidate for the job.
B:	oh yeah.
M:	there is a lot of time left.
B:	what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism
M:	how do i'm going to vote now.
B:	and uh i know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote
M:	what do you mean uh i know you can't vote here you know no one's going to vote for you!
B:	and the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks the hours are good and they're even open on saturdays and a couple of sundays.
M:	i know i'm just saying you can't have a referendum but you can have a vote.
B:	and so we've got plenty of time to go because down here in houston it's uh the lines are long.
M:	yeah but they'll have time to finish the race.
B:	so uh but uh
M:	the people i know are from dallas texas and i'm not from dallas.
B:	well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line
M:	well uh i'd like to do that.
B:	and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day.
M:	i've voted in a few election days but i'm still not going to vote.
B:	uh-huh yeah.
M:	the first two are easy but i'm not sure about the third.
B:	um yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the republican party. and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh the not the ballots but uh my mind has gone blank. i've been all evening how they develop uh what the candidate stands for
M:	
B:	you know the views and uh you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting.
M:	we do you
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you and.
B:	right. there for a while that would that worked. we've uh i know i have um i'll stick to uh to the you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy.
M:	i'll
B:	but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party because i know you know something about the other guy
M:	oh yeah
B:	or you know they're both just as bad and i'll say well i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um but yeah. you know that's not the best way but
M:	yes that's that that.
B:	but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for.
M:	yes.
B:	right or what you've heard on t v which i think is just outrageous.
M:	i don't know what you
B:	i i don't agree with how the media handles elections.
M:	we have to have a good story to the people of iceland.
B:	i you know i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out
M:	yes. the polls are what we call a joke.
B:	it's just it's just ridiculous.
M:	you can't tell me what to do.
B:	uh-huh it really could and uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
M:	he.
B:	yeah so uh
M:	i think it's funny that they're doing it because they're the media not the
B:	they really do. i i sometimes think that that should be limited more.
M:	the media is pretty much the only thing that can get him elected.
B:	oh yes or they i agree with the freedom of the press you know and all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
M:	well you have to admit that they have some freedom of information.
B:	no they don't.
M:	i am not sure if they care.
B:	well i enjoyed talking to you.
M:	you are a good man.
B:	all right.
M:	i guess you're right.
B:	bye-bye.
