B:	yes, we do practice capital punishment, but the nature of the, uh, courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.
M:	are you
B:	yeah. and then, i was reading in the paper just this morning, it's interesting because i had forgotten, i guess, that i wrote this little topic down, that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.
M:	
B:	well, i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know, who would see it.
M:	it's supposed to punish.
B:	yeah, but i'm not sure how successful that is.
M:	you would be
B:	quicker  maybe, yeah.
M:	it would be a lot more efficient.
B:	uh-huh. what, what kind of work do you do?
M:	i'm a lawyer, and i'm working on a case.
B:	um, well, see, i'm a school principal.
M:	oh, well, i'm just a school teacher.
B:	elementary school.
M:	i'm a student, so uh, how?
B:	and in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo kids. and i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
M:	i think you have it backwards.
B:	and, see, i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people, that, i mean, course, you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
M:	and, see?
B:	but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids, we'd have fewer decisions to make. down the road, you know.
M:	i think it's a bit of both
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	we could, we have, you know, children and money
B:	well i'm not talking about just in the school system.
M:	yes, but we do need to spend money on education.
B:	see, i'm talking about, like, in, in, uh, i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared. uh, i know the institutions don't work that well, but a bad day because i all these kids through my office. i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.
M:	you're right.
B:	five hundred of them are good, solid kids and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.
M:	5,000,000, 000
B:	and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible. some of them in the penal system.
M:	that's what i meant.
B:	and, you know, you just see those kids going down the road. now, not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment, but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing,
M:	yes, but that's because the law is so strict.
B:	and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals, and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system, i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
M:	...
B:	i think that's one reason we have problems in schools, uh, and some of them are our problems, but a lot of it's because everything society wants, we are supposed to do.
M:	ayea'a'ight
B:	but that's another subject but,
M:	i don't know, we don't have to worry about them
B:	anyway, i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has, making a decision what to do with them.
M:	oh, well i've got a lot to do and i'm not sure what to think of it
B:	uh-huh. i don't, i don't know that there is an easy solution, but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and i'm not sure what it would be. it would be money better spent than,
M:	yeah, i don '
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard? that's true.
M:	i think it's true.
B:	statistically, that's true.
M:	so is the state of the us.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	he was sentenced to death row.
B:	are you for it?
M:	u trollabot trollaboot
B:	i'm for it in  in some cases.
M:	i don't know, are you?
B:	yeah.
M:	are you sure?
B:	what kind of crimes would you use it for?
M:	i use it to write.it.very.very good.it is.good.it
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uh, what?
B:	i, i would consider it for sexual abuse of children, on going. you know, not one instance, but perpetual abusers of children.
M:	how would you define it?
B:	well, you know, somebody elected that recently.
M:	ugh, what about that?
B:	and all the civil rights people are up arms about it, you know.
M:	it was a big problem in the 70s and 80s.
B:	but, uh,
