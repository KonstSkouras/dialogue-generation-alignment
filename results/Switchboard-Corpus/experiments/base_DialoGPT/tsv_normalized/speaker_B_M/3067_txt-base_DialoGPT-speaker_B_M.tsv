M:	uh and
B:	uh no no not no this was well i am actually from mississippi and so that's
M:	...
B:	it it was around there generally.
M:	i don't think i've ever seen it before.
B:	uh that's where the family grew.
M:	uh what?
B:	yeah and it was not only in mississippi in some other places as well
M:	oh that's cool. it was in mississippi.
B:	so. it was uh it was a big deal but uh they tried to to centralize it in one spot. so in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year.
M:	i don't know. i'm not from the state of mississippi.
B:	we rent a pavilion and and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good. and uh they will rent a pavilion on a weekend and uh
M:	yes
B:	i have not gone back lately. in fact uh this past sunday was the was the reunion but i did not get to go. uh i have
M:	oh uh uh.
B:	not getting to go.
M:	what's the difference between the two?
B:	uh just uh the distance involved and
M:	he smiles back and gives you a thumbs up.
B:	uh just not i have a younger daughter now and uh i it's kind of hard to get her get her there and everything.
M:	uhhh... uh... how do you do that?
B:	but i am going to to uh hopefully next year get to go back cause uh a lot of the family has not uh on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter so
M:	uuhh uh
B:	i have one brother so.
M:	i know. i know.
B:	yes.
M:	did i say something wrong?
B:	right yeah.
M:	i'm sorry i'm a little confused.
B:	right i i usually see her a couple times a year so that's no no big thing. but uh i uh i do i do enjoy the reunions. the only problem is that now uh originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother's
M:	yeah i'm sure.
B:	uh father's. my mother's father's family had quite a few uh brothers and sisters.
M:	what are your fathers'fathers?
B:	so it was a large reunion of of of that group uh from that descendants.
M:	i uh i do
B:	and uh a lot of those people have and at time you know they all knew one another.
M:	uhh yeah uh that's what i said.
B:	and now it has gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group.
M:	but uh uh...
B:	and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be. so i think people feel less of a desire to really go. i know that
M:	uhm
B:	well i i just think that uh you know at that when when they were you know the those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same geographical location.
M:	i
B:	you know back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up uh you know they were all located together in one small community.
M:	you know uh
B:	and as as time grew i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. and now when they come together it's it's generally you know like say the kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and i do not think they feel the the closeness that they used to be there. which is a shame
M:	that.
B:	but that's just how it is. my mother was complaining last year about you know it's dwindling down every year you know that's just i think that's just
M:	i think.
B:	well yeah. yeah that's uh yeah i think that's some of it. but you know i have uh i i it's just the way you know i think society is now is that we are not we do not have the extensive family we used to.
M:	i
B:	it's more of a you know a smaller smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family. of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well.
M:	that
B:	uh
M:	that's a lot i mean it's a lot.
B:	right it requires a lot of effort to to to do that sort of thing.
M:	oh it's not that bad.
B:	i mean i i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it does not it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing.
M:	it's uh it's.
B:	you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family. and
M:	it's just going for the sole purpose of the show.
B:	uh um um no not really. in that but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i do. that's about my mother's sisters you know
M:	you're and
B:	but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them. but but uh as you know for the rest of that group no not really.
M:	that's
B:	uh you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh
M:	you know
B:	you do not really feel that that really close to them.
M:	i think i might be able to find them in the back of my mind if i look around.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yup.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't really...
B:	that's a good idea.
M:	lol.
B:	right.
M:	i'm pretty much.
B:	yeah. right.
M:	hehehehe you guys.
B:	yeah.
M:	i think it's funny that we can't talk about it anymore.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	them. i mean what about the
