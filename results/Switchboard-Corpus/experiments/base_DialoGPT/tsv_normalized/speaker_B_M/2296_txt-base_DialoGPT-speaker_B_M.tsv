M:	i walk.
B:	but washington is one of my favorite places to visit. uh, my daughter lives in arlington, and when i go to visit her, i love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern virginia or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although i don't do that regularly.
M:	
B:	but washington's a great place to do that.
M:	so what?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	he's the canal
B:	right.
M:	do you mean the bike path?
B:	do you live in the district?
M:	you can do it!
B:	because i think there're so many parts of the district where it's not very safe to get out and walk.
M:	why would anyone go to dc?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, if you can't find a safe place to walk, then it's no bueno.
B:	well, it's, uh, it's really both. i'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, and, uh, and most of the time i enjoy it. sometimes i don't, but i feel that, uh, that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't want to is also worth something.
M:	...
B:	and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising, like i'll be really tired, and i'll start swimming, and i'll, and i'll actually get energy. and i'll be, have much more energy when i'm done than when i started, i mean, i just feel great. that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim.
M:	you
B:	and that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, god, i'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,
M:	that
B:	but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
M:	i think of course.
B:	yeah, yeah.
M:	...
B:	so, can i just ask you, are you canadian?
M:	no, i'm sorry.
B:	philadelphia?
M:	where do you live?
B:	i'm trying to because you have a, you have one funny vowel that's probably going to drive the t i people crazy.
M:	it's a funny vowel.
B:	say out, instead of out you say out. did you know that?
M:	til there are people in philadelphia
B:	huh.
M:	i, uh, don't think so.
B:	huh. i see. i know this isn't on our topic, but where did you grow up in california?
M:	nope. you don't.
B:	oh, okay, because i grew up in north hollywood, california went to u c l a and all that.
M:	i live in california.
B:	yes.
M:	is that a good thing?
