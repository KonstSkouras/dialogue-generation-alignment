B:	yes.
M:	wait so you think that's a real thing?
B:	yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing.
M:	no that's the same thing.
B:	it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system.
M:	i think that is the point of the experiment.
B:	uh-huh. yes.
M:	hehehehe.
B:	that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally.
M:	it it's i know you you are you.
B:	you know i don't know or a person personally.
M:	what's a coincidence?
B:	i think i would be you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really. i don't know that it is. i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not.
M:	not.
B:	oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money.
M:	you're you are still not sure of appeals?
B:	yeah.
M:	i hope you're kidding.
B:	yes.
M:	do you know?
B:	yes it is. it's a tough tough question. it really is. i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that. like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it.
M:	that.
B:	oh absolutely. that's right.
M:	i am i think you have to.
B:	not with me personally. it is with a lot of other people.
M:	is there a religious or a religious religion.
B:	it's not not to me personally no.
M:	is it not to you personally?
B:	no.
M:	i am so sorry.
B:	uh-huh. yes. that's a it's a tough tough question it really is.
M:	yeah but if you don't feel it you don't know how to feel.
B:	yes i think most states do have capital punishment. yes. but i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do.
M:	you don't think most states have capital
B:	yes they're only i was reading something about it the other day i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still.
M:	isn't there a death penalty in the us?
B:	a lot of them had to have elected not to do so. now i don't know what they do in place of it. you know maybe it's life in prisonment or you know something i i don't know how they handle it i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
M:	ohhapparently.
B:	oh yes. yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
M:	that
B:	yes.
M:	how do
B:	uh-huh. yes.
M:	well i don't think they do.
B:	right the first appeal is automatic so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
M:	the appeal is that it takes a year or so to get to the next appeal.
B:	there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing.
M:	i'm sorry. i don't get it.
B:	yes uh-huh. that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of texas. before that it was uh death by electrocution.
M:	
B:	yes it certainly does.
M:	it's
B:	yes it would almost have to be i suppose. if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection.
M:	does it have to go to trial?
B:	yes absolutely.
M:	is this one of the better ones?
B:	it's a it's a tough question. it really is. i guess if i had to say yes or no i would say you know yes. i i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes.
M:	is it?
B:	no i don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	do you think we should have a prison system?
B:	i think we hope that it will be you know some sort of deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that.
M:	how do you know?
B:	some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless. this may seem to be the best way out. i don't know.
M:	yeah. it's a crime but it's not a crime in the sense that it's illegal.
B:	easiest way out maybe. no i don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	the worst thing is that it's not a legal thing.
B:	yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy. yes.
M:	so what's the deal with dallas?
B:	absolutely. yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does.
M:	do you know what the number of murders per capita in texas is?
B:	yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not.
M:	yes you are.
B:	yes. yes so have we been very very fortunate.
M:	so have we
B:	that's right. absolutely.
M:	well we are a very small country.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so what are you trying to say?
B:	absolutely.
M:	well they do it all the time.
B:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	that's right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uhhh maybe.
B:	so would i i fortunately i have never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else.
M:	if you were in the jury i'm sure you would be able to tell the judge what the judge said.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	heh uh. i think i know you i'm uhhh... i think you're a guy huh?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uh yes
B:	right.
M:	it's not a problem.it's a problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean i'm not a lawyer but i can tell you this.
B:	sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is.
M:	i mean you can't be the judge of the jury.
B:	yes. so would i.
M:	i would.
B:	yes. absolutely.
M:	would you be okay with this?
B:	it is it's a tough subject it really is.
