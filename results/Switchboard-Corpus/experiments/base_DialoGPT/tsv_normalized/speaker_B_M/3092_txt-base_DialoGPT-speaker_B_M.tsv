B:	have i?
M:	i do.
B:	uh, no, not actually
M:	you mean to tell me that you have?
B:	okay.
M:	you have to have some kind of special relationship with me to be an adult.
B:	right.
M:	so, and you're you're right.
B:	okay.
M:	how, are.
B:	right. i, i think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.
M:	but...
B:	exactly,
M:	i don't think you understand how the job market works.
B:	exactly.
M:	it's not that much, just a lot of money.
B:	especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
M:	that's because it's a good way to get your blood pressure up.
B:	exactly,
M:	you're a lot more likely to get a new doctor if you have an old one.
B:	they always do.
M:	and it's always good to be home
B:	yeah, i think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
M:	a small business company, if you will.
B:	exactly. you you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
M:	i would not.
B:	also, for working women uh, i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
M:	i wouldnt have to work, just to pay my own rent and food.
B:	right.
M:	you're
B:	yeah. like in may case, i have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. and, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would, be making would be going to day care.
M:	i '
B:	and it would be just,
M:	the world would be a better place if people could be a bit self
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,  center.
M:	i'd say the most likely scenario is that they
B:	exactly.
M:	so if you're a mom, they'd be deprived?
B:	besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
M:	how would you know?
B:	and to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
M:	to be fair, i don't have a choice. i can get up at any time.
B:	and if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
M:	you are going on the same day, if you are in the exact same place.
B:	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
M:	i think that's what i'd do.
B:	i think i, think it would be fair.
M:	why not just get a job?
B:	i think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
M:	
B:	but it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
M:	yeah, i'd say so.
B:	i think it would be really. really great.
M:	no, but i would
B:	yeah.
M:	we should just go to the end of the world.
B:	i do.
M:	not really.
B:	eye care is good. i do not, i am not i do not think we have that on our policy.
M:	eye care.
B:	but, uh, we,
M:	i think we all do.
B:	yeah. it would be great, i mean, uh, the glasses that, the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.
M:	i have a vision exam on the 19th. i will not be attending.
B:	yeah, that's true.
M:	no, because you don't have a choice.
B:	right, now like my ... right. well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,
M:	she's got an optician.
B:	well, she does not have it, but, she is like, on the verge of it or, something.
M:	she has her own problems.
B:	her eyes are changing,
M:	oh, i see.
B:	and she has to be tested periodically. and, and those are expensive tests.
M:	she has to go to the hospital, she is going to test her eyes.
B:	now, i think your insurance covers her on that,
M:	i have to have her eyes tested.
B:	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know, that's,
M:	but it's a good thing!
B:	right.
M:	right.jpg
B:	right.
M:	right.
B:	now, i would like to see better dental insurance to me. was that our beep?
M:	i would like a chance to see some more of your dental insurance
B:	oh. huh.
M:	you know what, you're right.
B:	okay.
M:	i have no idea
B:	but, with the three children um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
M:	i know.
B:	because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well. for the, the orthodontia stuff.
M:	why, because it's a dentist?
B:	yes, it is.
M:	it's not that expensive.
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	that's the joke.
B:	yeah.
M:	ohh, my bad.
B:	right. my middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
M:	your middle child has a flat stomach, because she's a pallet.
B:	and it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
M:	he was born with a mouth, and therefore, he can't speak.
B:	right.
M:	yes. right.
B:	but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars, and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.
M:	yeah, i was just joking.
B:	oh.
M:	i read an ad.
B:	really.
M:	i'm sorry, but i'm not a doctor.
B:	that sounds like it would hurt more.
M:	i was thinking about it.
B:	oh, gosh. i, i would much rather that, do that, to myself than make my five year old go in and do it. that would kill me.
