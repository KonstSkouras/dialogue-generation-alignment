B:	that's the only way i could really,
M:	that sounds funny.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i know
B:	during the summers, like the, around where i live the, uh, homeless people i mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff
M:	what? how?
B:	and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
M:	and they have a giant pile of cans and stuff, and a lot of money.
B:	and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them.
M:	u dogetipbot 10 doge verify
B:	but, when, during the winter time i think they, they move south or something
M:	oh, you mean that they'll be back when winter comes?
B:	so, i don't do that anymore. and the, the recycling at georgia tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
M:	they come in the winter and leave them in the recycling bin.
B:	they just overflow.
M:	what are you talking about?
B:	so what's a guy to do?
M:	a man's gotta do what a man's got to do.
B:	i asked myself.
M:	who are you?
B:	really? huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. that is very inconvenient.
M:	there are no parking lots in the city center, so parking for people who want to park is very limited.
B:	inconvenient, even
M:	you could always just unload it and park it.
B:	but, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?
M:	it's not that complicated, just make a little button for the button and drag it up.
B:	yeah, i'm kind of, i'm kind of bad about it.
M:	you know, you're right.
B:	if i, if see a, if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something i'll throw it in there
M:	i'd throw it, but i don't think you can throw a.
B:	but i don't really, i don't ever take anything.
M:	yeah, but you're not a guy
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'll be in my bunk
B:	but wait
M:	and i know the farmer who goes there.
B:	i've never seen you before who are you?
M:	that's a weird way to spell me
B:	yeah, my name's bill. well,
M:	i'm sure it was.
B:	hi.
M:	i'm bill.
B:	me, too.
M:	atlanta.atlanta.a.atlanta.
B:	crazy. uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, julie?
M:	i love the smell of old people in the morning.
B:	do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
M:	it's a thing.
B:	really?
M:	they can recycle, and you can get them back.
B:	what about like those grocery bags?
M:	not really. i just use it as a temporary storage.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	yeah, you?
B:	they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
M:	but, what about paper?
B:	uh.
M:	they do
B:	those petroleum products are going to kill us.
M:	that's a good point. i wonder if they will be able to bring in the oil from saudi arabia?
B:	the hostile planet, i think, julie.
M:	where is it?
B:	the petroleum pretty much, i mean, those petroleum products i think are the big, uh, you know the great satan of the recycling.
M:	he's not a big guy.
B:	um. paper just seems so innocuous.
M:	that's not how you spell'paper '.
B:	paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.
M:	paper. i know.
B:	it comes from trees. how can it be bad?
M:	i'm not sure if this is bad or good.
B:	they treat it with chemicals or something? why can't trees break down? i don't get it.
M:	i don't think it's bad. it's a plant, so it's a tree.
B:	yep. oh
M:	you know what? i'll stop being a tool.
B:	really?
M:	they do, but it takes a while.
B:	huh.
M:	they are.
B:	i'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then.
M:	she smiles back i'll see you then
B:	i'm glad you told me that, because i use those at work, where i work and, uh, but i can just forget that from now on. i'm going i'm going to switch to the white ones.
M:	i'm gonna go with the green ones
B:	well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the nile.
M:	it's all good. i'm good.
B:	you think so?
M:	you can
B:	tablets?
M:	what about a book?
B:	i think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.
M:	we should probably abandon the idea of being a family.
B:	what do you think?
M:	i don't think you know
B:	kind of radical, i know but,
M:	well, i think everyone is in on the joke.
B:	that's true. everyone had a two way wrist watch t v on their wrist, like, uh, dick tracy.
M:	but then you have to have a watch that's on your wrist.
