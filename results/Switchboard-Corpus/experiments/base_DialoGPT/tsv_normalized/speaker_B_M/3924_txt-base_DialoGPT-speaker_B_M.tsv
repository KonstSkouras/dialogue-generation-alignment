B:	yeah. i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um uh well it is very frightening and scary. i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases and uh i mean whether
M:	...
B:	yes.
M:	so? is that why you have less money than other people?
B:	and uh whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
