B:	uh ...
M:	yeah uh yea.
B:	oh uh i was tested uh within my company. i think it's kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this
M:	...
B:	and i i feel like it's really just within the united states. it's uh it's okay. i think your record should stand for itself. that you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
M:	you.
B:	and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. i think they could uh save money by not doing that. you know every time say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.
M:	
B:	oh.
M:	i.
B:	uh not if it's done fairly. and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly.
M:	you're welcome.
B:	yeah.
M:	it's random.
B:	well they might tell you it's random.
M:	because it's not fair
B:	but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery. somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries. you know.
M:	it's not that hard to do.
B:	oh i see. how'd how did they how do they pick their people?
M:	because it's a random.org poll.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	what does a college
B:	oh i see. so do you ...
M:	i think you are thinking of the ncaa the one that is responsible for the ncaa's drug
B:	right. well do you think that should be implemented in the work place. you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
M:	
B:	right.
M:	i think it should be possible to send people who use drugs to test them
B:	right.
M:	right.
B:	right right. yeah it it would almost be like a a uh ...
M:	they would be mad at you if you did.
B:	uh-huh. and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.
M:	how would you react
B:	right. i agree with that. because i know personally myself i've been in the same job for three years it will be three years in august and i've already been drug tested three times.
M:	i
B:	well i'm an environmental engineer
M:	what?
B:	and i've been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus. so see i for some reason i've come up three times. that's pretty high statistics.
M:	high? no.
B:	no. no not at all.
M:	do you think that's how it works?
B:	it's a legal job you know
M:	i'm not sure what i'm doing.
B:	so see it's really strange.
M:	i don't know.
B:	oh uh-huh.
M:	it's weird. i've never seen a doctor in the world of medicine but i've seen doctors and nurses.
B:	right. well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and she came up negative.
M:	this?
B:	yeah.
M:	drug test
B:	right right.
M:	you're right.they can't force another drug company to drug test you.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	i don't remember this.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. and are they tested random?
M:	i mean you can be tested.
B:	they're ...
M:	uuhhh uhuh. uhuhuhuh
B:	oh okay. i see.
M:	the items are random.
B:	yeah.
M:	... do you have any job?
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	what are you talking about?
B:	oh i see.
M:	because the drug test is in the usa and there is no drug testing for a drug test in the uk.
B:	uh-huh. okay so they know that. and that's ...
M:	you're on the way to the drug test.
B:	uh-huh. okay. well ...
M:	well we know what's up.
B:	yeah
M:	you... uh... you don't know?
B:	i think so. yeah seven twenty-five.
M:	yeah. yeah.
B:	okay nice speaking to you.
M:	alright.
B:	bye.
