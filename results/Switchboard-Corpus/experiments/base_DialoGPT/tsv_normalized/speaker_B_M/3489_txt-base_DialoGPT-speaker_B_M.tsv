B:	yeah, uh, i was
M:	
B:	my community, that's cute. i live in a place called dye mound.
M:	
B:	or dye community.
M:	or dye tribe.
B:	and it's not a city, not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, i can't even see their house and, uh,
M:	they're in my neighborhood.
B:	yeah, i mean, uh, i'm out in, i'm out in the wilderness. literally.
M:	i'm a dog.
B:	and, uh, well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, i mean, to the asphalt, we're out there.
M:	oh, well, um, i like to live my life.
B:	and, uh, we, i do some interesting recycling things.
M:	i'm not sure, uh, i don't know.
B:	i'm building our house right now and i'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.
M:	... well, good.
B:	so when i drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.
M:	how are you going to build the car?
B:	and the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
M:	it's the weight that matters.
B:	hopefully, it's not my wife.
M:	i'm not sure.
B:	well, i thought i'd, you know, i'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. i don't know if you're familiar with that operation, but, what you do is you just build up the pressure
M:	that's not an escape, that's a ramp.
B:	and then you go over and release it and then it just, it just drops, you know.
M:	but then it won't, it'll just, uh, just drop
B:	very similar, yeah.
M:	like a hydraulic pump?
B:	well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, but you, it won't go down.
M:	i know, but what will it be?
B:	until you pull the pin, yeah.
M:	if you're driving on the right, you can go down.
B:	anyway i have another, uh, recycling method i use.
M:	i think you're going to have to get that out of the way, my friend.
B:	you know all that junk mail you get?
M:	i can't even think of a way to get it.
B:	the glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that.
M:	yes, i have.
B:	well, anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i, you know, happen to gather up.
M:	what do you mean?
B:	because, uh, well, like i say, we live a way and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.
M:	why are you putting all that garbage in the trash can?
B:	and i don't like that
M:	he sighs.
B:	so i don't do that. so i take it and i send, and i mail it back to them.
M:	i don't have any. i do have the receipt.
B:	i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
M:	you've had a lot of work done
B:	yeah. well, i think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.
M:	it
B:	for instance, uh, i saw a thing on, uh, nova, i think it was the other day.
M:	ugh. i hate you
B:	this guy has designed recyclable materials, i mean recyclable items.
M:	i'm not sure.
B:	whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.
M:	i think he meant to say that he designed it
B:	see, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
M:	no. it's a plastic recycler.
B:	if it's metal, it's all out of metal. it's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff.
M:	it's not metal.
B:	and, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale.
M:	i like this idea, but it is very, very impractical.
B:	make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle
M:	but the question is, why?
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
M:	and, uh, you know, recycling.
B:	and,
M:	the people will find another way.
B:	well, there is a guy in dallas, that's all he does.
M:	i don't think i've ever seen someone in the us say anything like that.
B:	he collects trash. you know, and,
M:	what is he doing in dallas?
B:	yeah, well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
M:	oh, he's in dallas for the whole week.
