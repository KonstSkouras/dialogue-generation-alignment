M:	and, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but it's got a good story line and i really enjoyed it.
A:	huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	it sounds nice.
M:	yeah, it is. it's, it has a lot of room for activities.
A:	oh, yeah?
M:	and so, uh.
A:	yeah. well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh i'm insulating myself from that problem.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i'm building my own house.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and as i look out the window of my trailer, i can envision all the insulation that's going up today
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	well, it's been nice talking to you.
A:	yeah.
M:	i was just going to ask you, do you do it yourself or do you have someone do it for you?
A:	i used to be a builder.
M:	oh, really?
A:	and i retired about five years ago and  started college.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and now i'm a college educated builder there's still no work, you know.
M:	huh.
A:	so, uh, you know, i decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
M:	oh, really.
A:	you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
M:	oh, that's right.
A:	well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
M:	that's right.
A:	well.
M:	it's, it, it is a terrible thing.
A:	as, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. right?
M:	right.
A:	hence the savings and loan problem we have.
M:	right. right.
A:	but, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. it's designed to be added on to.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. well, i figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so i want  to have a shop.
M:	that's right.
A:	ten acres.
M:	oh, ten acres. that sounds great.
A:	well, yeah. it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor. he's on the other side of a hill.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. seriously.
M:	yeah.
A:	well, in the winter time, i can see, see another guy but, you know, he's
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i can just make out his place, you know. i've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
M:	yeah.
A:	and, uh,
M:	well, i'm sure you're, you're a t i employee.
A:	yeah. well, i took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
M:	oh.
A:	and a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
M:	okay.
A:	but, in the house itself, i've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	and i have not had to use the heat.
M:	uh.
A:	because it's all geothermal.
M:	yeah.
A:	and with all the, see i've got, on the south side is all glass. well, as much as i could get in it, you know. and, uh, the east side is glass.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. so it's almost all glass.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh,
M:	well, that's interesting.
A:	oh, yeah. i mean, you know.  there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M:	yeah. yeah.
A:	so, uh,
M:	so you know, it's, it, it is hard to find time, time to spend together.
A:	well, not really. it's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	so the first, you know, the, the, the, what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
M:	!!!%!!',!!;!!'!!body!! remind me of that now.
A:	and the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	so i've got a pretty good grade there.
M:	yeah, i, i've, i'm trying to think of the other grade they put in there. i, uh
A:	and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	exactly.
M:	it's not a,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, and, uh, you just step in and, and it's like, oh, my god, i can't even do that
