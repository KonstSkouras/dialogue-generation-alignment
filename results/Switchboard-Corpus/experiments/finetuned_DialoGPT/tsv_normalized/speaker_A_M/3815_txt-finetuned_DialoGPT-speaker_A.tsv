M:	yeah i have a dodge aries.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and so uh i don't know i'm not real sure that uh that that's the way to go about selecting a car. i think you have to have a criteria that you can follow and uh.
A:	i see
M:	yeah.
A:	top of top of the line.
M:	right.
A:	oh.
M:	and then i'll get in the car and lock the door and try not to get out of it.
A:	uh-huh. right right.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	i mean they're not you don't have to be conscious of them. you know it it's just a just a part of being you you're not conscious of it.
A:	well i guess i'm uh more traditional in that i don't like power windows or power locks because the people that i know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
M:	uh uh.
A:	and uh so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh yeah.
A:	and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and uh i guess
M:	sure uh-huh.
A:	no i haven't. have you?
M:	i think i have.
A:	somehow i just think you know i like the idea
M:	well it's it really is nice.
A:	right.
M:	i mean you you can't deny that but you can certainly
A:	right that's a good idea.
M:	and uh i don't know if if they'd really make them mandatory i think it would probably make a lot of sense to have them.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	so i i'm i am not i don't know if i would go that far but uh.
A:	well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands. i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer american and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage uh and i needed air-conditioning and uh can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stick shift. and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
M:	yeah.
A:	it it turned out to be a a chrysler. uh lancer.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	yeah it's uh
A:	no a five speed. and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move.
M:	yeah. well that's true.
A:	well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable.
M:	right.
A:	uh
M:	well i guess uh my next car is going to be american because i have a honda and i really like it.
A:	i found that out. i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when i went in to and asked and that was a requirement so
M:	well that's true.
A:	so
M:	well i've i'm not sure if i've talked to anybody else in the eighties or not but i've got to say that i think the last thing i did to a car was i bought a dodge caravan.
A:	well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore. at least in this area.
M:	yeah i don't know if it's uh is it uh
A:	not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
M:	yeah.
A:	and so why do you like stick shift?
M:	well it's not my favorite but it's something i do enjoy doing.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i have to keep track of what i'm putting in and what i what i put in.
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	and i like it where it's cold.
A:	right and actually it's probably safer on you know at long trips because it keeps you more active.
M:	right.
A:	so
M:	yeah.
