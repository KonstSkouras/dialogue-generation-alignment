M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight
M:	oh.
A:	baseball has started.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh, oh, yes, we start here at, uh, five.
M:	okay.
A:	up until, it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in may.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching
M:	oh, okay.
A:	and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching.
M:	oh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so, i've never been, i don't know, i'm, i think i'm probably a little too slow for it, but i do like to do it,
A:	but yes, we're into baseball, and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. we even have peewee basketball here. so there's always something.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	both. if we're not doing sports we go somewhere.
M:	uh-uh. well, that's true.
A:	oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	no, usually in the summer time.
M:	oh.
A:	different places every year. we,
M:	where do you live?
A:	no
M:	i've been to, i've been in san antonio.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i just thought that was so neat.
A:	you know, i've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often, and that must be the thing. they really hadn't either. they went to the memorial, you know, when they go, it's on business
M:	uh.
A:	it's not really just to getting to sight see.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, i bet it is, too.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they took my, my daughter to go see it.
A:	oh, now my husband and i, we go different places. but our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close.
M:	uh, that's good.
A:	oh, yes, yes, yes.
M:	i was going to say, uh-hope.
A:	oh.
M:	and, um, we went to disney world, and it was like, you know, we'd go up there and sit around and have a good time.
A:	oh,
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we, we just didn't have the time to really do that. but, uh.
A:	yes.
M:	but, uh.
A:	oh, yes, but we try, you know, i try, my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does
M:	uh-oh.
A:	because, uh, my dad died, you know, when i was less than a year old
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so i always just had a mother. so i always thought, when i have kids, you know, i really want to be involved with them.
M:	yeah, i, i think that's the thing that really hit home a little bit, though, i mean, i don't have a lot of friends that, that have children, but i think, i'm always hearing a lot about the kids that have them and how they're doing so well, you, you don't hear a lot, you hear a little, you probably hear a whole lot about them from your friends that have kids.
A:	material things, yes, that is, yes,
M:	so, he wanted us to do it, but we didn't want to do that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i'm like, no, i'm not that old.
A:	best friends, now.
M:	but he wants, like i said, like to be with other people. like he wants his mom and dad,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, and you don't, you don, you have to think about that, and, you can't just say, well, you need to exercise, you got to be active, you've got to do what you want to do, and i, i think that's important, you, you're not just going to sit there and say, well, i need to do this, but i need some time to do it.
A:	yeah.
M:	but he's, you can't, you don't have, you have to have all that in, in your life.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so, it just kind of makes you feel good, you're kind of bonding with them and it makes you not feel guilty, and it's something that, you don't have to do every day.
A:	oh, uh-huh. yeah.
M:	so, you can see that there's a lot of changes, and i think, i think that, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you have to be a certain income holder and that's it, you have to go back to work and that, that you have all these rights that you've beenogged over and over and that just doesn't work,
A:	yeah, you have to
M:	and, uh.
A:	i mean, you honestly do. now i have friends that i love to death, but, and they have children, but their children does anything, we have to take them, and, you know to do it.
M:	uh-uh. uh-hums, uh-hum.
A:	and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying, well, i work full time too, you know.
M:	right.
A:	yeah, oh, yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	problem, uh-huh
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that.
A:	yeah.
M:	you know, and, and it's not like they're going, you're going to come home and you're not going to have any of that because you've done something wrong, you've messed up something else, you don't know.
A:	uh-huh, yeah, i agree with you very much so. now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college, and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too
M:	yeah, i know, i, i'm still going through college myself, but i've been married about eight years, so.
A:	would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	so.
A:	uh-huh, yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	that's right, but you can't take this money with us, though
M:	no, i can't.
A:	that's how i keep looking at it.
M:	well, you know, there's a lot that can be done, but i don't think it's, you can do it all.
A:	oh.
M:	it's like, i can get this for two hundred dollars and i can do this for three hundred.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, you don't have to worry about, you can just go and live there.
A:	oh, yeah, if you if you can, yeah.
M:	if you, if they're, you're right, if it's a large enough college, it might be, you might be able to get a good roommate for that much money, if your roommate's big enough.
A:	yeah. what are you learning to be?
M:	i'm learning to read and write and, uh, i, i'm, i don't know, i guess i'm a little slow, i suppose.
A:	what degree, i mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college?
M:	uh, i'm, i've been trying to get a, uh, a teaching degree, but it's just, i don't know, i think it's, i'd like to stay at home and my wife would like to go back to school and, you're right, i could go to a private school.
A:	oh, that's, my husband's into, uh, computers.
M:	yeah, he's, he works for the government, so he's sort of into that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i'm, i think, you know, looking for the job that, that i can handle and, you can teach and everything and i'm not going to, you, you're going to have to have a degree in something that's going to affect you.
A:	yeah.
M:	and so,
A:	and you don't want to?
M:	no, i don't, i mean i think i would like to go to argentina but i'm not sure.
A:	no, no.
M:	you don't, you don t want to do it.
A:	oh.
M:	and, uh, i, i'm not sure i would want to be stuck in that situation.
A:	oh.
M:	so, you know, there's, there are places, like you said, where you can just go ahead and pay cash for as much as you want, but you don taj a nickel.
A:	then you'll never leave.
M:	no, no, no.
A:	oh. uh-huh.
M:	and, and he went to school, and when he came home, he got a job, and his mom said, mom, you're not going to take me alive, you can't leave me here.
A:	well maybe something will open up for you.
M:	uh-hope.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i've, i'm looking forward to it.
A:	well, well i've enjoyed talking to you.
M:	you too.
A:	okay, bye-bye.
M:	bye-bye
