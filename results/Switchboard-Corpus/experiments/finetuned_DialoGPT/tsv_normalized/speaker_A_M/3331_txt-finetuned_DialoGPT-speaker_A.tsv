M:	uh.
A:	and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school is just totally different.
M:	oh, is it?
A:	you know, you just, you did not see, i did not see anybody in my classrooms, when i was going to school, act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah, that's right, that's right.
M:	but, um,
A:	my, my daughter's in the, um, fourth grade
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, um, there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom, where the teacher cannot teach
M:	uh, uh.
A:	and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with.
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	uh-huh. well, they, they just don't do that any more.
M:	yeah.
A:	but the school system's afraid of getting sued and, um, all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and, i also believe we don't, even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system, that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school.
M:	yeah.
A:	and, um, i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more, that maybe that could solve some of our problems.
M:	yeah.
A:	yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for, and you know, we'll just have to wait and see whether that's approved or not.
M:	well, that's good.
A:	you know, i don't know your feelings toward that. i guess we shouldn't get into that but, um, and what else, um, i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire.
M:	well, i know, um.
A:	i have heard stories, uh, from other parents that i know of, their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs,
M:	uh,
A:	oh, yeah,
M:	i mean,
A:	i've, i've heard some horrible, horrible stories about high, high school teachers
M:	uh,
A:	and, you know, to be, be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school.
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	um, that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system. i think, with what they have to work with, i think they're doing a pretty good job right now.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh, so.
M:	so,
A:	yeah, okay, so this is probably a real hard subject for you.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah. okay, well, i guess, um, we can discontinue our call now.
M:	okay.
A:	it was a joy in talking with you.
M:	thank you. okay.
A:	okay, thanks.
M:	bye-bye.
A:	bye.
