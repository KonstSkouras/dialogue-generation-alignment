A:	and, uh, i think that's a national problem, though.
M:	i think so.
A:	it's not unique,
M:	yeah, yeah, i mean, you know, there's, there are crimes that are punishable by death,
A:	yes. uh-huh. well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?
M:	uh-hope, we, we have.
A:	right, research triangle and all of that.
M:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, i'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
M:	uh-hue.
A:	really?
M:	yeah.
A:	really?
M:	yeah.
A:	um. well, here, uh, i'm not sure how many dallas has had. i've, uh, houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, i, i don't know. a, a number every week.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh, dallas is having quite a few. seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like i say, drug related. uh, i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.
M:	right.
A:	uh, i,
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	the economy is lousy
M:	yeah, and, and i don't know,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, they've, they have a, a real, uh they have real problem with, uh with hispanics.
A:	boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
M:	it really does.
A:	well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?
M:	well not really. uh, there's some, there are some really nice ones. uh we have a, a, uh, uh a very nice one. uh it's just a, it, it has a basement and it's the only thing that really bothers me. the rest of it is pretty nice. uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's not always the, the people that are at home are the ones that are buying the most.
A:	well, that,
M:	so, it's, it is a real problem.
A:	i see.
M:	and, uh, so, i was kind of thinking, well, you know, we're going to have a reunion in a couple of years, and i really like that
A:	yeah.
M:	so, i mean, i don't, i just, i think i'm getting old, and i don 't like it when kids are involved in things like that.
A:	well, i think you hit on one point there is you know each other.
M:	yeah, well, it's, it, it seems like it's pretty steady. i don't know, you, you need to keep up with a lot of things, i guess.
A:	i'm, i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything. uh, i am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, i guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts and, uh, i'm over the northeast part of dallas. it's a, in a nice neighborhood. the houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.
M:	oh, i see.
A:	but we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, i'm sure that aggravates it also.
M:	right.
A:	but, unemployment now in dallas, or in texas is up around six point,
