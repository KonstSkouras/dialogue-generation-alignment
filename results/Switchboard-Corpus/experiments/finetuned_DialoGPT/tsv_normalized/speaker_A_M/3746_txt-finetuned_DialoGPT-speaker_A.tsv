M:	um, i play in the lower divisions and, uh i'm a member of the n p r and i play at the professional level quite a bit.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we, uh we live right on a lake, so we have to, we have a good connection, but we have not played in about a year.
A:	do you, uh, do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf?
M:	uh, no, i, i try to. i, uh i just, i get so sick of it.
A:	oh.
M:	i, i, i play a little bit of bingo.
A:	i was going to say, that could be difficult
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	i think that might be true.
M:	but, uh.
A:	i don't like pulling a cart on firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path.
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	that is the reason, i don't play over there.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i like the course, but i don't play over there because, you, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart.
M:	oh, no.
A:	and, i don't think a cart damages the turf.
M:	oh, i see.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, and, uh.
A:	well, i guess i could use a card too. i live, uh, very near, uh, very close to the firewheel golf course.
M:	oh, uh-hoh.
A:	yes, i live in northwest garland. right up there near the golf course.
M:	okay.
A:	well, in the last two years, i have not played very much golf because i am involved in boy scouts.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so, i have, uh, i have, uh, i have children  boy scout age.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i have two boys that are boy scout age, and, uh, so i am very active in boy scouts
M:	oh.
A:	so i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby.
M:	oh.
A:	but i
M:	!!!%!! translated that's pretty good.
A:	but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college.
M:	oh, that's good.
A:	that's right. lessons are expensive though.
M:	oh, yeah, lessons are expensive, too.
A:	well, they would probably never make it then because i don't think, uh, i only took lessons for golf when i was in college.
M:	no, no, no.
A:	uh, as a course for p e you know so i could graduate.
M:	yeah.
A:	but, uh, that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual.
M:	yeah.
A:	i took one lesson one other time. besides that, uh, i just, uh, try to make the club hit the ball.
M:	yeah.
A:	i don't want to play strike out, you know.
M:	that's right.
A:	but i have fun doing it, some, uh, you know, i have some good shots and some bad shots.
M:	yeah.
A:	so you said you work, uh, in the gardens too. do you have, uh, a special flowers?
M:	uh, we have a special, um, um, uh, well, part time job that we do.
A:	my wife had, uh, just put in a bunch of, i want to say, they are pansies.
M:	yeah.
A:	she put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	and they have been, we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.
M:	really?
A:	that is when she did, i think.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time? will they make it through the summer sun?
M:	well, yeah, they'll, they will, and, and they're, uh
A:	well.
M:	but, uh.
A:	well, that is good.
M:	but i just, i just don't have the time to do it all.
