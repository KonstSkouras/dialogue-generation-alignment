A:	on my mother's side we've had several not  it's not really on a regular basis
M:	yeah.
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers. well all see all the family lives in once place except for a few of us are scattered about.
M:	uh.
A:	so they're pretty much just reunited always
M:	yeah.
A:	so it's it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
M:	uh that's good.
A:	i know that's
M:	it's not like you're going to go out and buy all these guns that are going to be illegal because you can't do it.
A:	do that that's true.
M:	yeah.
A:	how about your family?
M:	well uh we uh we we had uh a a uh family reunion in uh in in well it's just over the weekend and uh
A:	wow you're  a pro at this.
M:	i i i don't know if i'm a pro or a con on this. uh i think it's good that the families get together so often and uh the families become more communication and less attachment to one another.
A:	oh that's good.
M:	and it's a family reunion from all sorts of sources
A:	and then where do you meet?
M:	uh we usually meet in plano texas.
A:	okay.
M:	and they have a big reunion every year.
A:	okay. do you have relatives in vernon then?
M:	um yeah i have a cousin that lives in uh
A:	okay.
M:	do you live in dallas?
A:	right.
M:	vonwood.
A:	oh.
M:	so uh that's that that is a very very uh...
A:	right.
M:	and uh
A:	oh.
M:	and i take them to the park and uh have them do have a picnic lunch every day
A:	right.
M:	and uh they do a lot of fishing there.
A:	okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um
M:	well it's not a town hall it it it's just a it has like two rooms and uh the one room is like a big it only has one door and then the other door is open so you can just go out there and you know enjoy the quiet of the room.
A:	okay.
M:	and it's the first one that we have.
A:	potato salad and uh
M:	and you just heat them up you know and then you
A:	oh that's good.
M:	but uh.
A:	right.
M:	uh and and that's a real big thing in our family too is squash
A:	right.
M:	so
A:	oh that's nice.
M:	yeah and uh.
A:	right.
M:	and so that's why we have uh a variety.
A:	do they always have the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best  so that's what they get to cook.
M:	right uh-huh.
A:	well that's good. well  i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them. i haven't  been to a lot
M:	oh.
A:	but we talked  a lot about the the rituals
M:	right.
A:	you all equated the family reunions as  with the protestant.
M:	right. right.
A:	it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage.
M:	oh that's interesting.
A:	it was it was an interesting theory. she talked about the uh the catholics all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe but when the protestant ethic happened in america there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home for their reunion so that  became their version of the pilgrimage.
M:	huh. that's interesting.
A:	but she had it was interesting you know i don't know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and um you know about the bread and the ritual placement. do you have a a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every every year? is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that?
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	right.
M:	and uh we we're all from uh in the you i guess you're from the dallas area
A:	well that's pretty .
M:	and uh.
A:	sure does. that's wonderful.
M:	so i think it's it's a wonderful thing.
A:	yeah. i wish we'd
M:	we'd have to have some kind of a plan that was able to accommodate everyone.
A:	right.
M:	so he had to work until he was ready to go and and so he had a lot of time to think about what he wanted to do.
A:	right.
M:	!!!!!!%!! remind me.!!!!!that's right!!you!!i!!it!!yeah!!?!!did!!okay!!well!!hi!!have you ever had a uh a real barbecue?
A:	wow. you're just uh oh that's incredible.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	right.
M:	but i was able to you you had to have have your own people you weren't able to just walk around and shoot everybody else.
A:	right
M:	and then we had uh  uh a big roast that we had for breakfast.
A:	have you have you done this repetitively or just once?
M:	yeah once.
A:	oh.
M:	and we were there for a week and i was there for about a week and a half and it was wonderful. i mean it it is a beautiful country.
A:	see that's we've we had a problem with that.
M:	i don't know i guess i don't have a problem. i i just think that uh you know.
A:	oh.
M:	and they're still you still can't get around.
A:	right. that's our was our problem. we had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and then the second reunion people who maybe you know had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought oh well it's not that big a thing this year
M:	uh.
A:	and so it kind of wound down
M:	well that's that was the only bad experience i ever had.
A:	and then finally you know you're lucky to get you know you get the shreveport relatives there but no one else so that
M:	right.
