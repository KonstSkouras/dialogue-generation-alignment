M:	what part?
A:	um, the south hills area, beaver county, well originally beaver county .
M:	oh.
A:	and, uh, where are you from?
M:	i'm from, uh, i live in raleigh, north carolina.
A:	oh, okay, i know where that is.
M:	yeah, it's, it was, it had a lot of trees there, and, uh.
A:	yeah, that's pretty out there. what, well,
M:	we're just north of, uh, washington state.
A:	oh, okay, yeah, i got my brother and my whole family there. i'm, i'm talking to you from dallas right now.
M:	oh really, okay.
A:	uh-huh
M:	oh.
A:	no, my husband does.
M:	uh, okay.
A:	and who, how about you?
M:	well, we're, we, we have a daughter who's a sophomore at u t and a daughter that's a senior at u c l a.
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
M:	right, right.
A:	well that's okay. i guess it's an easy thing to do. so you're you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?
M:	uh, well, i have a town home, but it's not a very large one. uh, i, i guess i do have a small town home.
A:	oh, that's a, those are beautiful.
M:	yeah, it's a four story.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but we've had, uh, a lot of problems with, uh with, with the, uh the, with, you, i don't know, the, the molding, uh
A:	yeah, is it a, is it a working farm or is it?
M:	it, it's a working, uh, farm house.
A:	more, more, i can understand that, that's probably what i would, uh,
M:	uh-uh. i think we're going to have to do something, though, because i just don't think we can afford it.
A:	yeah
M:	i'm in the process of, uh
A:	i can hear the accent now i hear the i hear the western pennsylvania, um.
M:	oh, yeah, i've, i, i grew up in western pennsylvania,
A:	we live, uh, we lived in minneapolis for about five years.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	we, we originally lived in dallas and we met and got married
M:	uh.
A:	and then, um, actually married in pittsburgh, and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
M:	oh, really?
A:	at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, uh, up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i
M:	uh.
A:	and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	and it's, uh, near a little town called plano, well, it's not little any more.
M:	uh, that's right.
A:	uh, yes, that's out near the airport. that's about forty-five miles from us.
M:	that's a long ways.
A:	it's, yeah, that's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt? minneapolis-saint paul is very clean
M:	uh-huh.
A:	you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
M:	uh, well, i, i agree with you. i, uh i think that, uh
A:	it really is, i mean we're, we're in a leased town home, and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	but, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
M:	yeah.
A:	and, and i just have no tolerance for that.
M:	yeah.
A:	no.
M:	but, uh, i don't know, i think, uh
A:	yeah this is, it's like a duplex, like a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and it's nice but it's, i mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten, and now she can't sell it. and our neighbors,
M:	uh-hau.
A:	yeah, i mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank god,
M:	yeah.
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	that's how bad it, i know.
M:	yeah, yeah, well, i don't know. i donno, i, i just, i guess i donate to the, the, uh, the school system, and i, and, and the, and it's, it's just been so poorly run, and and, uh.
A:	that's right. uh-huh, yeah. i have some friends that live in westport and it's really, really bad. i mean you,
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's a good house.
A:	how far, where is clarion county in relation to, actually, because we're considering moving to pennsylvania
M:	uh, well, clarion is about an hour and a half away.
A:	that's not too bad. that's north.
M:	yeah.
A:	are you going up toward, uh, uh, i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an m, bradford, no that's too far north.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so you're, you're not that far north then, okay.
M:	yeah, it is. it's about twenty miles north of, uh, washington d c.
A:	well, you're really not too bad. yeah.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!! remindme!%
A:	um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years, or that you've,
M:	no. it was, uh, a home where my mother was living at the time.
A:	oh, then you have, yeah. do you have a lot of land or,
M:	yeah, we have a, uh, well, we're close to a lake, so we have quite a lot.
A:	oh, my, well, then.
M:	yeah, but we have, we do have a garden here.
A:	there you go. did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like you live in an isolated area or,
M:	well, i, i live in a small town.
A:	yeah, i think that that's, um, i can remember in pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly but i can remember when upper saint clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of washington,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and now it's it's a terrible connection.
M:	uh, yeah, i, i don't know, it's, it, it just seems like, like i donno, i'm, i grew up in the south, and i think it's mostly, you, you have more of a southern draw, and a southern accent, and you don't hear anybody outside of your immediate family.
A:	oh, well that's okay, um,
M:	so,
A:	but, but, yeah, substantially, you know. um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
M:	!!!%!! remind me that's a real good idea.
A:	how big is it? how many square feet do you have?
M:	it's about a square foot and, and, uh, it's, it, it has the, uh the, the nice big three rooms and,
A:	well how many rooms do you think, yeah?
M:	i don't know, i don't think i could fit everything in.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and we have one on the other side of the den, and, uh we have a den that's completely filled with other people's stuff, and i think that's the only thing that we really have trouble with is the bedrooms because, you know, it's not really a den but a, it kind of like a, a, you're not really supposed to be looking at the bedrooms, you just want to be there to be entertained,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then we have an outside area that we put up, and we put a, a pool, and then we put another one up. and then we're supposed to go swimming, but it's, it's not enclosed, so we have to shut it off.
A:	a junk room, yeah i understand, we have that too. that's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
M:	yeah, well, mine are, and they, and i've got two other children, so they're both grown and i don't have a lot of spare time either.
A:	that's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
M:	uh-uh. well, that, that is, that can be, uh...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we've got a couple of houses around our neighborhood that are really nice, and the one i'm in, it doesn't have a basement.
A:	it's enough space for two people yeah.
M:	yeah, i'm, i like that idea.
A:	oh, okay.
M:	so, i don't know, i guess that's, i think that's a, a, that's an advantage of having a smaller house, i mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be bigger, it's just the fact that it's close enough to the house to the school.
A:	yeah, right. that's okay. well, we've got, um, this town house is pretty big. it's about eighteen hundred square feet. it's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
M:	uh-huh.
A:	um, it's really nice.
M:	wow.
A:	yeah, it is, i mean, i would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	oh, is that right?
A:	um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know. um, we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
M:	uh.
A:	right, near dayton, ohio, and he said, you know, he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
M:	oh.
A:	right.
M:	but, uh, i, i don't know, i just, i really don't have any, any strong feelings one way or the other about it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	that's kind of what, like his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of atlanta and, in georgia,
M:	uh.
A:	and it is too far south for me,
M:	um.
A:	but, um, um, but i mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log cabin, i just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these. i mean, it's just beautiful. it's like a custom, you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins. you know, i mean, it's modern it's,
M:	yeah.
A:	right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country
M:	yeah.
A:	it's you know, um, but, uh, i don't, what else about housing except it's, uh, well, pittsburgh's housing economy, i think it's holding it's own.
M:	yeah, well they, they're building a new stadium downtown, and they're going to, uh.
A:	what part, what sections are they in? yeah, that's nice.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	great.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! remind me of that one.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's still, it's, it still works fine.
A:	uh-huh. that's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in penn hills, and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
M:	uh.
A:	and, um, it's, it's, you know, they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
M:	oh, i would think so.
A:	um, but it's a beautiful home and, i mean, my brother lives,
M:	uh, how about you?
A:	is it called baldwin or bebble?
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	i mean, he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon, um, it's real pretty up there. it's just,
M:	oh, i see.
A:	and the neighborhoods are stable you know.
M:	uh, so, so you're just out of the loop.
A:	it's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	oh, my goodness.
M:	and so we, we were away for a while, and then we came back, and now we live in an apartment, and i'm away for another two months.
A:	uh-huh. that's what it is here, yeah, that's why we're at a point now we've, uh, we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in yeah,
M:	uh, that is a, a big jump.
A:	that's kind of like where we're,
M:	and it's just kind of,
A:	so we're considering pennsylvania, and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
M:	right.
A:	a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and, but i disagree with that, i.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etwork!! remind me of that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's, it's just a, it is a nightmare.
A:	i know, and it, and the economy here in dallas, i mean, it, it's steady, but it's still not going up.
M:	well, i know, i, i think that's, uh, i don't know, it just seems like, uh you know, the, the only thing that's going on here, it seems like it seems, it really is a problem, you know.
A:	and i, um, i just refuse to buy it, um, if i know i'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, i'm sure, yeah, there, i mean, you can go down a street, and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
M:	uh, uh-hum.
A:	um, it's really, i mean, and, and it's hard to sell the properties. people from j c penney's from new york, came here about a couple of years ago.
M:	yeah, it sounds like you've got it under control, then.
A:	and they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, and it would make you ill to see this.
M:	right.
A:	i mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in pittsburgh or something.
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	yeah, i know, and that's, you know, like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
M:	uh-hope, yeah.
A:	you know, it's across the way, and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
M:	uh.
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
M:	yeah, yeah, it, it is.
A:	yeah but you have a rider.
M:	and you have to let him get away from you, but otherwise he's good.
A:	no, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, i think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
