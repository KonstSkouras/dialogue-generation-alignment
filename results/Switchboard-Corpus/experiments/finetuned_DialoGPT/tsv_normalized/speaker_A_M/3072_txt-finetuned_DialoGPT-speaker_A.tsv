A:	is that a nice vacation spot?
M:	uh i haven't been on a real hot hot cool hot summer. i mean i've been on on a nice hot mild summer.
A:	right okay.
M:	and uh.
A:	right. so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
M:	uh no because uh
A:	ooh that would be nice.
M:	but uh.
A:	did you scuba dive there?
M:	oh yes yes.
A:	ooh that would be nice.
M:	!!!% yeah that is that's what we like to do. we've got a we've got uh we have a little uh little little well little school on one side and a football field and uh we've we're kind of on a picnic table out there so we we do uh
A:	oh that would be enjoyable. right yeah that's a nice break.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i haven't been on vacation in a while either. um usually when we go we go to colorado to estes park area. which is up kind of near denver. and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the texas heat that kind of thing.
M:	uh-huh. uh-homing.
A:	so it's a lot of fun. i worked up there last summer so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long
M:	yeah.
A:	worked at a camp there and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation.
M:	oh.
A:	oh.
M:	so that is a new experience for them.
A:	that's nice. we um we canoed up in arkansas at the buffalo river.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and that's the best place that i've ever canoed.
M:	oh that's really nice.
A:	it's really really pretty. i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about mountain things. you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river
M:	uh-hue.
A:	and we would have to we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and that's a good family place to go
M:	yeah.
A:	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening but it wasn't you know too easy either.
M:	yeah.
A:	it was like
M:	yeah.
A:	that's true.
M:	so.
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	!!!!!!et!! remind me.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh so that that uh...
A:	well that's good. well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that.
M:	uh-uh.
A:	and then i went to england a few years ago.
M:	oh really?
A:	i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in london.
M:	yeah.
A:	and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place and it's there's not a language barrier so you don't i mean there there's a little bit because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's it was really fun. i i i really enjoyed that. i'm probably going back there to work for a year.
M:	yeah.
A:	it it's really nice. i would i would spend all my time in london or most of my time
M:	uh yeah.
A:	and that's it was really different being in a big city because i don't get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot
M:	!!!!!!%!! remind me of that that i used to do a lot more urban exploring when i was younger and i didn't have to drive as far as i did now because my car was so old
A:	and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
M:	right.
A:	you could just kind of kind of walk around and observe
M:	right.
A:	i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
M:	oh how neat.
A:	and i had a great time doing that. it was really interesting.
M:	oh.
A:	yeah i know
M:	and i would i would love to go to the east coast you know i love to travel
A:	i keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states. i haven't been to mexico or canada or
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh.
M:	and uh we lived there for a while and then we moved to dallas about a year and a half ago
A:	yeah that would be nice. i had a friend from there.
M:	oh yeah and i i would like to go to spain.
A:	then i i'd love to go somewhere in asia but i'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
M:	oh that'd be neat.
A:	so yeah that's why that's why england was nice. even we traveled in europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the most the places we went we went to germany and switzerland and
M:	uh i'm not sure if you have any children in the united states.
A:	yeah we have. we . we did we whirlwinded through europe.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night.
M:	uh-hue.
A:	but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in germany knew english and everyone in switzerland knew english.
M:	uh-hau uh-hue.
A:	so we were kind of pitiful. we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no one knew english in there and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
M:	yeah.
A:	but it was
M:	uh
A:	oh i had fondue. that was easy to say
M:	oh.
A:	tried to get fondue and white wine and that was
M:	okay. uh first of all what type of painting do you do?
A:	we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly. there were some people at the next table who spoke english so we elicited their aid for a while
M:	oh.
A:	and they were very helpful
M:	uh-hue.
A:	so it was it was a pleasant time.
M:	yeah.
A:	i'd i'd love to go back there. there's just not time there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything.
M:	yeah.
A:	right. that's
M:	yeah.
A:	that and sleeping late
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i keep hoping for.
M:	yeah it's it is a real problem. i'm not sure how long it's going to last but you know we've got we have got to have something.
A:	well it was nice talking with you.
M:	nice talking with you too.
A:	and have a good afternoon.
M:	you too.
