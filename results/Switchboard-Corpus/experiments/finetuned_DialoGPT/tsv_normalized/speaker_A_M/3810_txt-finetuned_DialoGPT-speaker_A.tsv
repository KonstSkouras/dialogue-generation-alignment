M:	she's a concert director at a high school in richardson.
A:	uh, i play the piano
M:	oh, great.
A:	and, uh, i have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano. he does that, uh, musically, listens and then he can play, which is kind of interesting.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at music man.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah, and that's lots of fun.
M:	that's, that's neat.
A:	uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. it was the plano repertory theatre.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and so they went and tried out and my husband played harold hill from the music man and my son played one of the children in a band.
M:	oh, that's neat.
A:	so, yeah, it was really fun, and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school, and my daughter takes piano lessons, too.
M:	i see.
A:	but, uh, we just really like music. it's a, i, i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off, we get the t v off and just have some nice quiet music.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	okay.
A:	uh, i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki. which is an auditory type learning experience.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	you listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that.
M:	oh, that's, that, that sounds like fun.
A:	i teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano, but he can't learn like that. he's a delayed child. he's only about, i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things.
M:	um.
A:	and, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand, we went, wow
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	we better have him do do something. you know, educationally.
M:	yeah.
A:	so that was really fun.
M:	well, i guess that's about all i need to say, about music.
A:	my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown, though.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	so, my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into dallas.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	um.
M:	and she's, she's learning all kinds of stuff and, um, so i'm hoping that, um that she's able to kind of stay home and not have to worry about what she's doing.
A:	oh, i think that's great.
M:	i, i don't know.
A:	that's really hard i think, because, especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something, they go, i don't want to do this anymore and you're like god, i really want you to do it.
M:	yeah.
A:	you know.
M:	i mean, i was, i'm thinking, you're right, that i need to go back to work and i need some kind of support. you know, i know that my husband's been fighting, you, you think, i need, i, i can go back in two years and say, okay, i got to go, you have to go through this. and i said, well, i have no, i won't go back, you don't have to do that anymore, you can go and do it as long as you want. and, uh.
A:	so sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when, but, i don't know, if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it.
M:	that's true. that's true, that's true
A:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!ets!! grammar!! =!!et!!;!!!!!you!!this!!i!!that!! that!!have!!a!!ctic!!
A:	that's like me.
M:	i have a son who's ten, who's nine, who, uh.
A:	well, it can get expensive
M:	yeah.
A:	that's for sure.
M:	well what kind of car are you thinking about buying?
A:	i, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the suzuki method without paying a lot out.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, so it's been good for our family.
M:	well, that, that sounds like a good plan.
A:	i don't have any suzuki students. uh,
M:	uh, do they have any kind of musical or,
A:	something happening to me at christmas time that, that verified to me that i will
