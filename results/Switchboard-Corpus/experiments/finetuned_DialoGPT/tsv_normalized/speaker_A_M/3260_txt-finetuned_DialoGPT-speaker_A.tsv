M:	yeah.
A:	and i spend most of my time carpooling
M:	uh-huh.
A:	the story of my life
M:	uh-huh.
A:	my kids are involved in sports. my daughter has played basketball for six years, and my son plays football. i, my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yes. i know, i know. the insurance.
M:	and, uh.
A:	yes. my son, is in both band and scouts too.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, gee.
M:	so, uh
A:	right.
M:	so.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh we were trying to do things like, uh you know work out, and, and things like that.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	we found this oriental tile game called mah-jongg .
M:	oh, i know.
A:	have you?
M:	yeah. and, uh,
A:	well, it's really fun. um, one of my neighbors moved here from memphis and a lot of them played it, and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, and they both enjoy it. so if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
M:	that's true.
A:	so, uh, we play that a lot of them, and, uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	we have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so, that, and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	my daughter and, and i hate camping so we go shopping. so that just kind of works out real well.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	and, um, i'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too, so a lot of times, she and i will travel to writers conferences together.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	that's a lot.
A:	so that gives us special time together too.
M:	well, it does, it gives us time to think, you know,
A:	and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so i can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	yep.
M:	well, i think that's neat.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh, i think it's important that they, uh they have some basic values of, uh you know.
A:	right.
M:	they want to see the world and they want to participate.
A:	my husband has taken us to work with him, and we still don't know what he does.
M:	yeah. well, that's, that, that is, that was a big part of it too, was the, uh.
A:	so, we just say he travels a lot. so, that kind of covers it.
M:	well, it sounds like you guys are, uh...
A:	yes. yeah.
M:	i, i think he is, you don't want to get into that too much, because, you just, you have to find time for yourself.
A:	he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yes.
M:	well, that's great.
A:	so those are the real killers. if he's just gone,
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	he's gone three weeks right now and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	so we just, you know. i just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. and something major, always needs to be done.
M:	yeah, i'm with the kids all the time so,
A:	so you just have to, to handle it until he gets home
M:	yeah, i know.
A:	and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
