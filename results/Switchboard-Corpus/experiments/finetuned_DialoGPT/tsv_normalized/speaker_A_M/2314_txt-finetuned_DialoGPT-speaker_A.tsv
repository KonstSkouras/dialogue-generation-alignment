M:	and i think they ought to test just about anybody any time they see fit.
A:	well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
M:	uh, i think it's a pretty good idea. i think they ought to test at, before they hire.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think they should do it everywhere.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i don, i don'y know how i feel about that.
A:	well, what about random testing, though.
M:	!!!;!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
M:	i don't know. i mean, i don't, i, i think that's, that's the whole thing. i don tinker around with it, you know, i'm not that good at it,
A:	i don't know that you do. if it's random, then it's random
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!eting!!
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh,
A:	yeah. well, i i know that, for instance, in the n c double a, they drug test and it's not random.
M:	right.
A:	uh, well, i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
M:	uh-oh.
A:	and from that point on, uh, at, the n c double a does have something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
M:	right.
A:	and, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
M:	uh, i guess that's a little more stringent.
A:	well, not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights. if someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
M:	right, uh-huh.
A:	and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me, i would be upset.
M:	right, yeah.
A:	it's an accusation, and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue.
A:	right, exactly. i, i don't, the, i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.
M:	exactly.
A:	what type of job do you have?
M:	i'm an avon representative.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so i, uh i'm, i work for the government, and so i'm involved in, uh uh, oh, the clean air program, and i work in, in the national parks, and, uh so i've, i, and the reason i, you know, i feel that way is because, uh because the, the problem with the air pollution is that we don't have a, a good, uh system of, uh testing and so we, we don tinker with it, uh.
A:	well, does your does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
M:	uh, well, it's, it, it depends on the job. i mean, uh, i mean i, i can work in the automotive air bag industry, and i've, i worked in the transportation industry for nineteen years.
A:	well, that doesn't, i mean i ...
M:	i, i think they should have more control over what they do.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, you can't do that.
A:	that is odd. i was drug tested, uh, not for the job i have now, but for the prior job, uh, but i know that they sent, that the job i had before, that, well, the job i have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
M:	uh-uh. oh, that's, that is,
A:	well, no, i don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i, i didn't, i mean,
M:	uh-hope.
A:	they don't know that i don't use drugs. they just tested me once.
M:	yeah, i,
A:	but, i used to work for a power company, so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and since i was just, you know, one of the office folk, i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
M:	yeah.
A:	no, they're, all of them are tested once every three
M:	oh, okay.
A:	it's a rotation.
M:	that's right.
A:	but it, but again, it depends on what job you're in.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
M:	right.
A:	but, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
M:	right.
A:	they say we, we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah, it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.
M:	i know.
A:	well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
M:	i beg your,
A:	okay.
M:	okay, well, i guess that's about all i've done so far.
A:	okay.
M:	so, um, i guess, i, i'm not real sure what our policy is as far as, uh, the u s government from, uh government as far, you know, from government as, as far from, you, know, government as corporation goes.
A:	nice talking to you. bye-bye
M:	!!!%!! remindme!! auto attacks.
