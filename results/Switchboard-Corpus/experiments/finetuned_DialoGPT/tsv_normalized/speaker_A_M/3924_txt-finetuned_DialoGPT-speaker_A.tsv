A:	and actually i'm concerned that they're not. i have a friend who is working with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and one of the ones that he's worked with was professionals who came in for an aids, uh, conference in, uh, california.
M:	uh.
A:	and these were from other, people from other countries. he's a translator.
M:	oh, really?
A:	and in talking to the people from france he said, you know, he says, one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is. and they're letting, the information out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.
M:	right.
A:	which is scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it. so, i guess i'm, i'm, i'd like to see us spend more. i don't know that spending more always gets it.
M:	yeah.
A:	you mean more money for that means less for cancer or,
M:	well, i think, i, i agree with you, i also think that, uh
A:	yeah.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i'm not sure that that's going to happen.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, i, i agree. uh, i think that, uh that, that's a really important part of, uh uh, education and that, you know, that you have to have the ability to have that, because i think, uh-hil samhuntum is a good example of that,
A:	well it, i, i agree with you there because i know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.
M:	uh, i know that, uh.
A:	money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served? uh, that's a good point.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so i'm really concerned about that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm not, i don, i really don't know what the answer is.
A:	well, and one of the things i'd, and i'm with you that i don't know is, is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more.
M:	yeah.
A:	that's, that's the part that,
M:	i mean, you, you have to look at it more from a, a selfish point of view, you don't want to, you want to take care of the world and you want, you can't just come in and do this, you need to make this world a better place for all of us,
A:	that's the part that scares me, you know. i mean beginning with this is, this is just for homosexuals, well no, it's for homosexuals and gays, well no, actually, it's, i mean, you know. did they know that all along?
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh
M:	and, you can get it, you just have to be careful.
A:	right.
M:	but, uh.
A:	and how is it really transmitted, et cetera.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	which is, i think, what they also don't know. i mean that's, i think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.
M:	right. well, they can tell us anything they want.
A:	it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that isn't how it was in africa.
M:	right.
A:	in africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that, and it's huge over there. so i, i, you know, and it's beginning, other countries that's what's his point. this was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this.
M:	yeah.
A:	and does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?
M:	well, yeah, i mean, it's kind of like, you just isolate them, and then you can't eat them, you don't know what you do with them.
A:	i mean i don't know. all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know. uh, or maybe they understand but,
M:	well, i don, i think that, that, uh, you don't have to worry about, uh you know the child care, the, the whole school system and everything, i mean, that's, that would be the most important thing.
A:	yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back. if you, if i were dying, i'm not sure i would care.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, right. i'll take anything you know.
M:	!!!%!! remind me!! remind me!%;!!;!;if!!et!!list!!if!et;!%%! reminders!!?!!i!!this!!it!!you!!that!!we!!have!!me!!yeah!!what!!and!!okay!!so!!well!!nice!!
A:	i mean if i'm dying, if i know i'm dying, you can experiment on me.
M:	yeah.
A:	go ahead.
M:	you can either stay in a room with, uh, a chair or you can go into a room where nobody's around and just have them go around and,
A:	exactly.
M:	and they're going to get the same treatment that we do.
A:	yeah. yeah. and that's what i think they're saying too.
