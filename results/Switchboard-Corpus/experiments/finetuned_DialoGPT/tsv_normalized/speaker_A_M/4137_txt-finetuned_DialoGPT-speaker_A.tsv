M:	i'm, i'm not an american car person at all.
A:	no, regardless of that fact. it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money. i'm interested in having it for, uh, doing a little autocross racing, uh, closed circuit racing
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, it seems to just blow the competition away.
M:	well, that's the way i feel about hondas.
A:	handling, power, everything. yeah, it just got like the top rating. it was compared up against, uh, let's see, there was like the mazda m x three, uh, nissan's, whatever, their two, n x two thousand, the civic s i and it just, you know, it, it dominated over all of them. everybody, all the, uh, raters loved it. i like the, i like the styling and, i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	mustang g t uh, can't afford it.
M:	well, that's, that was, that is a mustang, yeah, the, the g t is the same.
A:	right, yeah, i'm a graduate student and, let's face it, i don't make any money so,
M:	no, i, i never did.
A:	yeah. yeah, we'll see then. yeah, right now i'm stuck, i, i've got a, a pontiac sunbird turbo that, it's fast, but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing. but it's, it would be nice, just like scrap it and go for the saturn.
M:	well, we've got, we have a dodge daytona, and we've had, uh, we just bought a dodge omni a couple of months ago, and it, it was, it, you know, it handled just like a truck, you could put it in, and, uh it, the engine just kept running, it ran just fine, and the only thing that really bothered me was the seats.
A:	oh, yeah, i'd do it, i'd use it for both. the nice thing about autocrossing is you can, you can do both.
M:	well, that's great.
A:	uh, just like a, uh, set up a lot of times and it's like really large, uh, parking lots. and pylons and things.
M:	yeah.
A:	tight turns, hard acceleration. i've seen a lot of mustangs, uh, compete and it's interesting. they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	huh.
A:	uh, what are you thinking about buying?
M:	well, i've been thinking about it for a while, and i really don't know. i think, uh i would like to buy a new car just for my family.
A:	the legend. uh.
M:	oh, really?
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	yeah, well, i was, i was actually in, uh, a lot of the b m w are produced in, uh, uh, stutgardt and, uh, and munich
M:	uh, uh-hau, uh.
A:	and i was, i was there this, uh, summer and, uh, i was really impressed by the, uh, the, uh, factory, uh, tours and such for b m w.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	uh, oh, of course, of course they are. they want you to buy their car. yeah, there, it was, it was interesting. i was at, i, i also went to, uh, the porsche and, uh, it was, it was amazing how they were completely opposed.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, the, uh, the b m w is really, oh, like, oh, we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and, and then you go to porsche and it's like, well, uh, these cars are completely handmade
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and no two of them are alike and
M:	oh.
A:	so it's like completely opposed. i don't know, which do i like better, i think i like the porsche's philosophy a little bit better, although it's not really practical.
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	unless, it's, it's a toy.
M:	yeah.
A:	let's face it. yeah, yeah, but it, it, b m w good for that. what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it, use it for?
M:	yeah.
A:	wow, yeah.
M:	so,
A:	that's cool.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah, that's good. i also, i was impressed by, uh, by the mercedes, too.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i really, i really like the mercedes.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	the factory was nice and, and is it different for the, for the b m w?
M:	uh, i think it's, uh-huh.
A:	probably. right, i can imagine that.
M:	and, uh, i, i'm not sure that i'm satisfied with it at all.
