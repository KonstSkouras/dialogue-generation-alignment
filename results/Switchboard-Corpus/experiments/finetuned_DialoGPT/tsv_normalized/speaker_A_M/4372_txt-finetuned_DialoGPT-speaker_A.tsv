A:	yes.
M:	and, uh  and i'm not sure that's, that's not part of the problem. i mean it's just that i'm being cheeky and, uh i'm in the middle of it. i'm, i think it's part of it and it's also part of my character to be cheeky.
A:	i, i'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what i understand from various net readings, it, the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get. with some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?

A:	which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
M:	right.
A:	and i, i  i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.

M:	oh, okay.
A:	yeah.
M:	but i think they have the sales taxes in pennsylvania based on the amount you buy.
A:	that's true. a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, i, i forgot that. there, there is no well defined mechanism at all and, and that it is a a loss. i, i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. uh, i mean, i, i don't know if i agree with that. but it, but,
