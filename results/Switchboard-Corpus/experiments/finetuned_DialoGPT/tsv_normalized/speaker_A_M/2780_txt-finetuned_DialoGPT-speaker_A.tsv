M:	yeah. uh-hue.
A:	so it really is a different um
M:	well i think that uh you know i think i think a lot of people are more uh i think more concerned with their safety than with you talking about the safety of their kids i mean i'm not a i don't know i was raised in a baltimore i grew up in uh
A:	yeah that's that's right talk to i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually you know had just purchased a gun that day  and was going target shooting you know
M:	right.
A:	and it was very different it was a whole  different view. it's really um this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did and now i talk to people that do. so that's it's really interesting.
M:	uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i i have a a son that's a you might say he's a sophomore in high school
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're in the same school system as my daughters
A:	yeah.
M:	and i don't know i guess i'm not for sure what the laws are anymore. i i think they're pretty much on the books as far as guns go.
A:	yeah isn't it funny.
M:	uh yeah i mean i'm sure a lot of people uh i know a lot uh a lot more people a lot less than i do uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and and uh i mean you know it's just uh
A:	uh. yeah.
M:	and uh i don't know i i think they should have uh.
A:	yeah well you can possess 'em here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like uh the the brady bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues
M:	uh-uh. uh-hue.
A:	you have the seven day waiting period.
M:	right.
A:	yeah
M:	oh that's uh
A:	that's uh that's
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh i don i'm not too sure that that's the main difference between the n i s a and the other newspapers.
A:	yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way i guess most of the um the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose
M:	!!! reminder!! there's an!!i know there's an old saying that if you give someone the right to make choices they will vote for you.
A:	and and both of them are both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah
M:	yeah
A:	yeah sure
M:	okay well uh i'm not so sure that i agree with that wholeheartedly. uh i think that we should have more prisons and i think there should be more.
A:	well i'll tell you. i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen do you know what i mean?
M:	i know.
A:	it's only because they make a big stink over it. but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity they're they're they're right in the sense of freedom of speech but i would never
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	i i don't know. i i'm not really for it. i don i mean i think i
A:	yeah. well it's that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on america stands on is that they can do that uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh you know but i i still what the flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	unless the burn unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently.
M:	yeah i don't i don i i think uh uh i don'member the the burning of the flag
A:	uh no but i think that's that's uh it's that's taxpayer's money. if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and of uh public property and whatever.
M:	well that's true.
A:	no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what america stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government.
M:	right.
A:	uh i think that's what's made democracy
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah. well that's that's true
M:	uh
A:	yeah but i think i i yeah i i i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers. um. there uh one of the republican the appointees for the the judicial bench and they always talk about they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down.
M:	uh-hue
A:	and um i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in
M:	uh what do you think of the civil war?
A:	my understanding of how it was framed is that you this the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh i yeah i and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i i think that that's viable. um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point. i think. yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right
M:	no i don't. i donno. i mean i i think it would be good if it was a a flag that said freedom of speech
A:	and i would never do it. i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me.
M:	right.
A:	um. but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something it's a need for them you know.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah. yes. no.
M:	and uh i don't know i i think that's one thing that's important.
A:	right. yeah. uh huh.
M:	uh and i don't think that the government should uh uh excuse me excuse me. the the the power structure of the united states is not as uh uh as powerful as it should be.
A:	uh huh.
M:	and i don't want them to have to live here.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh i'm not sure what the colors were but uh.
A:	i agree there too. i agree with you there too. i i the um i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh we have a right to stop somebody from that you know
M:	no.
A:	the same i don't know i guess i get i get uh all mixed up inside. when yeah
M:	yeah. i do too.
A:	it when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically um even you know for instance the pro life pro choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion but they would vote pro choice.
M:	uh that's true.
A:	because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing you know
M:	yeah.
A:	but yeah. but it that's uh that's what i mean see but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response. i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just aren't you know
M:	uh-hugs.
A:	no no i think the um sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the uh christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term. and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology.
M:	uh i've heard of that.
A:	so then that so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then. so it's i don't know. it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy-turvy world and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um within a
M:	uh well that's a good point. i guess i've never really thought about it that way. i've just always thought that maybe there are some boundaries that we're not supposed to be drawn on. i mean that maybe we should be able to separate them.
A:	yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one one extreme to another.
M:	right exactly.
A:	uh i think that uh you know i i just read something i think in time magazine uh about um protest
