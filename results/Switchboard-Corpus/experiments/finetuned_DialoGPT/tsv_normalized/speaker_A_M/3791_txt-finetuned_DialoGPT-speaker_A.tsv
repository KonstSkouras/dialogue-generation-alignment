M:	yeah, that's, that was the first thing i thought of when i saw the price tag.
A:	uh, got kids?
M:	uh-huh.
A:	married?
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	we had to cut down to about three hundred and fifty dollars to get the, to get, to put the sign down.
A:	well, my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet.
M:	oh, no.
A:	uh,
M:	but we've had, uh, some pretty good meals out, and, uh we usually order out of a restaurant or out of an open bar.
A:	uh, yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and, uh, what kind of dishes you might have for it, or some sort of thing like that.
M:	right. uh-hue. uh, i like to have, uh uh, a lot of different kinds of foods. uh  you know, a nice, uh, uh, you know, homemade french bread with maybe some, uh  sausage, uh sausage, you name it, uh
A:	let's see, a good dinner party menu.
M:	yeah, that's something i like to have.
A:	i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming, i guess.
M:	oh, sure, yeah.
A:	you know, uh, something light and easy. if it was pretty informal about anything.
M:	right.
A:	breast of chicken oh, gosh, yeah. how do you usually cook your deer?
M:	uh, mostly like, uh turkey and a chicken breast or turkey and, uh things like that.
A:	how do you usually cook your deer?
M:	uh, usually, uh
A:	yeah.
M:	we usually, uh, just, uh eat out
A:	yeah.
M:	and then we'll, uh, let it cook on high for a while, then put it on low for another two hours to cool it up.
A:	i imagine.
M:	it is good for you.
A:	i would imagine it is.
M:	and, uh, i have a great recipe for cheese cake.
A:	yeah. yeah, i understand. we just had, uh, deer stew sort of uh, it was deer steak stew. uh, well about a day, day and a half in the crock pot, uh uh, some deer steaks in kind of a mushroom gravy.
M:	oh.
A:	uh, some veggies in it.
M:	oh.
A:	no.
M:	no, no, no.
A:	no, the times i've been out deer hunting, i, i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean, i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles. so, no, this was given to us by some friends.
M:	oh, that's wonderful.
A:	uh, guy was in a, uh, in a hunting club
M:	uh.
A:	and, you know, but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day, they split it
M:	uh.
A:	and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it is split with the rest, with everybody in the group.
M:	uh.
A:	well, he they, they went out last year and almost everybody got it, the limit
M:	uh, i don't know, i, i just, i think, uh, i'd like to see it happen more where people can actually get out of a car and get on the road and get around and enjoy themselves.
A:	so there's, everybody had deer coming out their ears. so,
M:	oh.
A:	yeah, they, they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they, about eight months ago they gave it to us.
M:	uh.
A:	we, we either crock pot deer or we'll, uh, you know, put it out on the grill so that, uh the bulk of the tallow will dribble off of it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	that is good.
M:	!!!ety-!!etwork!!%!!body!!eting!! remind me!!ets!!eder!! et cetera!!;!!!!!
A:	deer spaghetti is real good.
M:	oh, i love that.
A:	anyway, uh, no, i think if i was going to have a dinner party, i'd probably have, uh, sandwiches or something along those lines and then, uh, uh, you know, just something light finger food sort of something or, or maybe have something roasting out on the fire.
M:	right.
A:	oh, well, anyway. uh, we don't do much in the way of entertaining.
M:	no, we, uh.
A:	usually it's, one other couple come over for a dinner.
M:	yeah.
A:	let's see, what did we have the last time we had guests over. ah, yeah, we had a, uh, a turkey loaf.
M:	oh, i know.
A:	which, uh, kind of taco turkey loaf. it was good. uh, scalloped potatoes.
M:	ooh, sculled,
A:	no, mashed potatoes.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	mashed potatoes with, uh, cheese melted over the top of them. a couple things like that. it was pretty good little dinner. yeah, usually it's
M:	it's not, it's not good on mondays.
A:	oh, don't you hate that? i've got a, i got a few pounds to lose myself. that's okay.
M:	well, that's good.
A:	i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old.
M:	oh.
A:	yeah, yeah, i was, left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade, grade at two,
