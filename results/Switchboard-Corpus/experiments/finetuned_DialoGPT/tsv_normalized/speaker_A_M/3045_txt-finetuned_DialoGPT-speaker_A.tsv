M:	so,
A:	right.
M:	but, uh, we do use them. uh, i'm not really sure how they compare to the american express, but they're, uh they're similar.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh. and what kinds of things do you use it for when you when you go to their houses to them?
M:	well, uh, we use it as, uh a way to, uh  get around.
A:	yeah.
M:	or, you know, they have office paper, uh.
A:	oh.
M:	and so, um.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	she, she, she is a teacher.
A:	great. yeah.
M:	and i've got copies of both of those.
A:	oh, sure.
M:	but, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh i haven't used it much lately.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah, well, i tell you once you get used to having them you, you get spoiled really quickly.
M:	well, it's a, it is a hobby, but it's not like it used to be.
A:	uh,
M:	well, i, i guess that's true.
A:	oh.
M:	and he had to, uh to write code in binary and, uh and, and then he just couldn't get around the computer.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and he's been trying to get a couple of more and, and, uh he's, he's written a couple and, you know, he keeps threatening to write a couple more and he keeps on dying them
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh, i'm not really sure what they're going to do.
A:	right.
M:	but they're still, still, uh, you know, they still have a lot of appeal.
A:	yeah, yeah. um, i i'm a, a writer by profession and, uh, when, when i was first here in, in dallas or in plano, um, and was finally able to, this is, oh, been like fourteen years ago we moved here. and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter, and i got an i b m selectric. i thought i had died and gone to heaven because i thought, oh, they're so wonderful.
M:	i don't know, i, i'm kind of, i don't, i've kind of gotten out of the habit of, uh
A:	well, then, um,
M:	!!!!,!! remind me.
A:	yeah, ours really needs to have some work done on it but, but then my husband, um, worked at t i and i got a, um, this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore, but he got a, um, uh, the, the t i professional and brought that home and i learned wordstar on that,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, boy once that happened, there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! translated!! translate!! english!!
A:	yeah. have you ever used, do you use wordperfect ever? have you ever used wordperfect? or,
M:	no, i haven't.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, i haven't used it, i don't know, i just remember seeing an ad for it and thinking it was really great.
A:	right.
M:	and it's really, it really is. i mean, i've, i can't remember what the name of it is, but it's like, uh, it was like, it had a hard-core type of thing, you know, like theakers and all that.
A:	yeah, yeah. that's probably where you've used it.
M:	it's, it was really weird.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. um, i have that on my, uh, computer here and also, um, i do some work at u t d and, uh, that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and, and already know the you know, already know the, the software. and, um, i don't know from my own experience, um, wordperfect is just so much better than, than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have. it may be improved by now but,
M:	uh, yeah, i mean, it's, i'm not, i, i think it's been for a number of years, but, um.
A:	yeah, it's, uh, wordstar was never very intuitive to me. i mean you know, you, some of the commands just had nothing to do with, you know, what you were supposed to be doing what they, what they did on the computer but, uh,
M:	right. i, i, um. i do know a little bit about it. i'm, i'm a computer scientist.
A:	i mean like going, um, forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just, you know, didn't match with the kinds of keys, you were using.
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	and so, i mean, i was like, no, i don't know, i just go ahead and type it out, you're just like, okay, i'll sit down here and do it, you don't have to do it.
A:	and, but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways. and you, and it does a lot of things too that if you, if you do any kind of, uh, research or anything like that where you have to, uh, use footnotes, it is just wonderful. because it keeps track of all your footnotes.
M:	right.
A:	yeah, and if you add it, if you put a footnote in, in the middle, you know, if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it, you just change, um, it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so, you know, it's just,
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that
A:	yeah. yeah. and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything, and oh, it was just awful. so, um, i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled. but i think, it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled
M:	yeah, i think so too.
A:	so, um, well, i have not really paid much attention because i clock, although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so, um, if you, um, unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, um, i was a technical writer for many years, um,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and my husband and i actually met in a computer company. um, i was a tech writer and he was an engineer. and, uh, so i did tech writing for a number of years.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh, sure.
M:	so, uh.
A:	got a problem, huh? um,
M:	no, i, i do, uh
A:	oh. trying to figure out what all that was about, huh?
M:	yeah, the, the telephone.
A:	but, um, i have, um, that, that was the majority of my writing although, um, i have also done oh, free lance magazine writing and some educational writing. and, um, for a while i had a, um, uh, a partnership with a, in an advertising agency with another woman who is a, an artist. so i did some advertising and p r but,
M:	oh, really?
A:	um, now i'm, actually i'm, i'm not working anymore. i'm a student, i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but, uh, now all of the scholastic majors though,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i've done a little, a lot of different kinds, but i, i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great. and, uh, i'm, so i'm real spoiled.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	it's, uh
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	it's just that i'm so anxious to get back into it, to get it going again.
A:	good.
M:	so she's learned how to do that and she's got the same level of interest, you know, as i do.
A:	that's great.
M:	so, uh, i've got two little kids and, uh  they're both in preschool.
A:	yeah.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!! remindme!et!!argent!! alarm!! command!!list!!all!!range!!sv!!action!!body!!get!!function!!upper!! subter!! upgrade!!xt!!?!!func!! variable!!important!!this!! this!!you!!you!!okay!!i!!etesting!!have!!we!!and!!!,!!that!!absolutely!!my!! auto!!atic!!%%!!est!!do!!right!! that!!
A:	well, those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on and, you know, the, and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so, um, i think that that would be a real, a real, uh, advantage to, to her to have that and, uh, do it early,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so. uh, do
M:	do you have any children?
A:	oh, neat.
M:	uh, but, uh.
A:	yes. right. oh, great.
M:	so, she's, she, she does a lot of that.
A:	right
M:	and so,
A:	that's great. well, that's a, that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life, so might as well start now, huh?
M:	that, that, that would be, that'd be the only thing, i guess, that we would do to her, is, you know, if we could just have her, you, know, like your grandmother, or whatever.
A:	well, nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly. this is really going to be fun i think,
M:	it's going to, it's going be fun.
A:	and, um, my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the,
