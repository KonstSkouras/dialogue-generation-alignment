M:	uh.
A:	and then when i would come home and he would leave and um so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something. it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M:	right right.
A:	and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. so there's one or two nights a week we have a on monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together.
M:	yeah.
A:	yes.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	oh you are?
M:	yes i am.
A:	yes and
M:	oh.
A:	so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on saturday usually in the morning.
M:	right.
A:	right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday but we're it's real important to us to spend time together.
M:	that's right.
A:	i have two.
M:	oh well you're one of them.
A:	uh-huh. i have a girl and a boy and the boy's five he's in kindergarten and the girl is four. she'll be in kindergarten next year. uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh my youngest daughter is eleven and my oldest daughter is two. and uh
A:	they are a handful.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so uh  you know
A:	yes.
M:	and we're still uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	well no and it's it's just not um it's not as stable for the kids
M:	yeah.
A:	and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. but uh it's yeah.
M:	!!!%!! remind me
A:	well it's also important i think um for my husband. i i try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them.
M:	right right.
A:	so he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night. he puts the kids to bed
M:	uh.
A:	and he reads to them
M:	yeah.
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that and that's that's pretty good quality time with them
M:	!!!%!!;!! remindme!! remindme!%
A:	and um but it's hard for him on saturdays. he he wants right he wants to run out and get things done
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and so um i try to say well why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something.
M:	oh that is that would be good
A:	and if i have something in mind then he he remembers that that's what he wants to do.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know and i think that's important because you can tell when they're when they get older you can see how much they've lost.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they had a nice big roast it was like roast beef you could feed it for two adults and then roast the potatoes and then you had uh like a big roast beef sack full of fresh berries and then put on aitas and onions and then a little bit of amaretta and some crayon wine and then just cover it with foil and put it in the microwave for just a minute to cool it up.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they had they had this little light that they put on the outside of the car so they could you could see what the the emissions were.
A:	yes.
M:	so we left and then we came back and it was dark and we were gone so long.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but we didn't know that.
A:	well that's right. but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated. it's not nearly as important.
M:	uh i think that's probably true.
A:	we find that you know back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems the first place they went to was their family.
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh uh-uh
A:	and families took care of themselves and um but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh it it just you you don't have that anymore. you have to work for it.
A:	that's right and
M:	and so it's it really is a waste of someone's time.
A:	right right
M:	and they don tinker with that and you know they don they aren't you don't see the mistakes in every work place
A:	and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know i you know i have interests that too
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life.
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i'm like i'm not that old but i just i just can't seem to stick with it.
A:	right.
M:	and so it was a little different.
A:	it is temporary. it in the middle of it it seems like a long time
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
A:	but you're right it is temporary. well i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	uh that's true.
A:	and and in spite of
M:	well i i think that uh you know that that the uh...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh i'm sure you're not alone there.
A:	yes.
M:	so i i think you see you don't see too many single mothers having children. you see more single mothers um having children you do see more um
A:	that's true.
M:	you know i mean i i've had people uh let's see i had a friend who was a teacher and she said that uh...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so it really is you're right.
A:	yeah.
M:	and she just she just really doesn't care about the child either. she's just you you just have to accept that as it is.
A:	well it is the hardest thing i've ever done as much as you'd go out
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh uh-uh
A:	and
M:	i just i was just thinking i just you know i have to you just have to find a place you have to make it you don't have to go out and buy it
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	well that's good.
M:	and uh it's just you know she's such a wonderful person and i i just i really i'm just pulling for her.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so that's really uh.
A:	no. yeah i think so. i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious. you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong.
M:	uh well i know my wife's mother in law is a a uh a practicing vegetarian.
A:	yes.
M:	but uh.
