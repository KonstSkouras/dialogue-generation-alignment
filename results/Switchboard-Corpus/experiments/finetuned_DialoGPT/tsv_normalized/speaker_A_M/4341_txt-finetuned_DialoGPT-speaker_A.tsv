M:	i i agree with you.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and and he's he's going to be out in two years.
A:	so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then.
M:	well i think i mean i think it's a good thing but i think that it's i don't know it's something that needs to be taken care of.
A:	right.
M:	but uh i i don't know. i guess i'd have to say that i'm not in favor. uh i think it's a pretty good idea.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society.
M:	yeah.
A:	right. and then do it all over again. uh-huh.
M:	yeah.
A:	right. have to agree with you and i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also. i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it i just i don't know that it's always effective but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it. it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
M:	right right.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. right uh-huh.
M:	and then you see them in jail for a year or two and they're out doing it again.
A:	uh-huh huh. do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society. it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that.
M:	yeah. i i you you can't say that they're they're a danger but i uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess. uh
M:	uh well
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. um. uh-huh. you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment. so if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person. and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh but i i don't think that's done much anywhere that's kind of drastic punishment.
M:	well i know uh
A:	right.
M:	but uh.
A:	might make you feel better but
M:	well i
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	because i know that there are a lot of people who would be willing to give up their american citizenship just for that very reason.
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh. right because they're a danger to everybody else. huh that's interesting. i have to uh agree with that.
M:	!!!!!!that's right.
A:	there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh and uh
M:	yeah yeah i think that that there's a a lot a big part of it is uh uh the the society doesn't understand uh.
A:	right. right probably more of them then the other way around interesting. i don't i don't not sure i i'm in washington d c or at least very close to it. i'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here.
M:	uh-uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
