A:	all local. were they like all in dallas?
M:	yeah, uh-hope so, because, uh.
A:	oh.
M:	but, uh,
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so i was kind of hoping that, uh.
A:	just from city to city then .
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	so, it was a big deal for them.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	do you go back?
M:	yeah, i go back every year to see my grandparents.
A:	is it choice or just business or,
M:	well, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i don't know why that is. i mean, i do have friends that go to a, a private school, but they don't have the money to go and, and do something like that.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	oh. do you have brothers and sisters?
M:	yes.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh. and, is your mother still living?
M:	yes, she's still living at home.
A:	oh, so, so you go back and visit with her anyway. would you not?
M:	no.
A:	i mean, either way there was family reunion time, or not,
M:	uh-uh.
A:	relatives, right.
M:	and i'm not sure that i would have liked it if my mother had been there.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh uh, you know, they all lived in the same town,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	right, right.
M:	but, uh.
A:	the next generation, uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	why do you think that it's less close than it used to be?
M:	!!!%!! translated!!you know!!it's just, uh.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	i think that they feel like they have to go.
A:	right, right. right.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that is a, a major problem that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.
A:	is that just family's lack of priority, anymore, maybe yes , we get so involved in our work lives and just, social lives and so forth.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we don't need the, uh
A:	right, right.
M:	and, and, uh.
A:	it really makes an effort on, to, do this anymore.
M:	yeah.
A:	right, right.
M:	but, uh, it's a very good program.
A:	right, right.
M:	you know, and, and that's why, you know, it was so funny when i went to the movies because, you, you miss that.
A:	do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group? on a regular basis, not just christmas cards.
M:	no, no, i don't, i'm not.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and they, uh they, i don't know, that's probably, uh.
A:	right.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	right, right.
M:	!!!!,!!;!! remind me of that now that you mention it.
A:	right. in my, my, uh, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either dallas or oklahoma city. they had chosen santa barbara, california for this summer and, and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far, because most of us live either in the midwest, or like in the texas, oklahoma area.
M:	oh, really?
A:	and, uh, so they cancelled that one and, uh, are looking next year bringing it back closer, but we have a letter, a family letter, that circulates,
M:	uh.
A:	and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top, and then that's the way it's kept in order. and then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, i do not know anything about this person. you have, read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth.
M:	oh, that's, that is, that, that would be a good idea.
A:	so, you are kind of, half way acquainted that way.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and that, that's been a, that's been a nice way of keeping us all aware of each other, i think.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.!!if!!if!!you!!i!!that!!?!!we!!well!!okay!!it!!they!!did!!have!!and!!so!!oh!!let!!the!!!,!!this!!.!??!you?!?i!you're!!there!!good!!yeah!!because!!is!!what!!see!!how!!now!!sv!!all!!you!!same!!do!!but!!et!! auto!!one!!p!!a!!are!!'re!you'll!!he!!take!!me!!;!!=!!o!!this!! this!!who!!uh!!huh!!my!!two!!in!!by!!not!!no!!your!!maybe!!big!!thank!! another!!>!!'!!it!!nice!!hi!!
A:	we tried to start that in my husband's family. his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago, and i said, well let's start this letter, and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got. i sent it, on to the next one,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, and, but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one, in scottsdale, arizona, for that family.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	we are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only like two of the, one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left. and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home, so, we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago.
