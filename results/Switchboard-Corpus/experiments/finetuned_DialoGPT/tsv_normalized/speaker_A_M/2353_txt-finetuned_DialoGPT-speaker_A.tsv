M:	and i think that's good.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	because they're not, you know, they're more, um
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but the women don't.
A:	you know, i, i really agree with you. um, i, uh, though i've never done that myself, i, i'm, was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to, um, very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	and i did it, um, for one reason i wanted, i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree, but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing
M:	uh.
A:	and i, it changed, it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
M:	uh, uh-hue
A:	and i think, um, in fact, if i had to do it all again i, you know, after that, you know, you never think of it because, i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself, i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back.
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	um, so that was, that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along, and i'm still paying these college loans, i, i think realistically, you know, you can have your college loans delayed now, because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old,
M:	huh-uh. oh, that's, that is, that would be, that'd be an ideal situation.
A:	um, i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed
M:	oh, really?
A:	and i thought that was, you know, very interesting and i, i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done, you know, just like, is that, is this, is that the mormon church, that does that?
M:	uh,
A:	because one of my neighbors, uh, did that in pittsburgh, from pittsburgh.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and i thought, you know, that really, now that i'm thirty years old, i think that one or two years out of my life would have, probably like you said, to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country, i think it would have been a very good, um, experience for me.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's kind, it's, it, it is a, it would be kind of selfish, but it's a good thing.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, um.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. and i think, you know, we have such a need now, you know, i taught, you know, i, i think i was paid, uh, about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year
M:	uh.
A:	and i worked in a very rural school district and i, i, one of the things i taught was a computer class
M:	uh.
A:	and these kids, um, you know, every girl i taught, except for one, was pregnant.
M:	uh.
A:	many of the boys in the room had children and they were, they were high school juniors.
M:	uh.
A:	and i just, there, you know, they came from poverty, they were going to condition in poverty and it was, it was, the school district couldn't hire many people, it was very difficult for them to hire, and i think, you know, in the sense, that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities for, um, just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical, um, things, i think it's a really good idea. and even if it is overseas.
M:	well, i'm not sure if it's the teachers themselves that are the problem, but i think the school districts.
A:	see, i never, i, i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country.
M:	well, you're right, we're a long way away from that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i, i don't know, i guess, uh, i just don't see the, the, uh the, i mean, i'm not sure, i see a great deal of, uh uh, improvement from, from the way we have it now.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i mean, it's, it is, you, you either want to serve the community or you want to be the world leader, which is the same thing.
A:	right. uh-huh.
M:	uh, you don't see too many, uh, young, young men running around with guns and shooting people or anything like that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think that is a big part of it, too.
A:	yeah. i think it would also help them if they then went on to college. i know that my first couple of years of college were, um, uh, probably too carefree at the, beginning
M:	uh.
A:	and then at the end i had to be too serious.
M:	uh, i know.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	they have to be there at all times.
A:	yeah, that's true.
M:	but i think that that's part of the problem.
A:	uh-huh, that's right.
M:	uh,
A:	i, yeah, i think, i think this was, this was a very interesting topic uh, because it's something that, you know, we don't talk about in this country probably enough.
M:	uh, well, i, i have a lot of friends that have, uh, children that have children, and i, you, you can't blame your parents.
A:	uh, you know,
M:	yeah, well, i guess that's, that was a good one to put on the list.
A:	uh-huh. yeah, that's true.
M:	and, um.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's, it's a lot more expensive, and i think that's part of it too, is that, um you know the, the quality of the food is really not as important, because it's not, you can't just make a meal now and expect to, you, you're going to have a very good meal.
A:	oh, i think it is.
M:	so.
A:	i really think, i think, um, people, you should, i, you know, the kids today i teach, i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
M:	uh-uh. uh-hum.
A:	and, um, i find great disgust in them, in their, in their, um, their self-centeredness and their inability to understand, um, multicultural or multiracial situation
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	and i really, you know, they don't understand, uh, how other people live, um, they don't understand,
M:	uh.
A:	uh-huh. yeah, i think that's, uh, just having a good time.
M:	yeah.
A:	i, uh, a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as short-term pleasure oriented. i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it, you know,
M:	uh.
A:	today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented,
M:	right.
A:	and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun.
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	well, it's nice talking to you.
A:	well, they say, i think i, um, have read recently that, uh, the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps.
M:	oh, really?
A:	uh-huh. because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe, uh, they've increased funding for the peace corps. some of the, i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense, you known,
M:	uh.
A:	when they're decreasing some of the military spending, some of that money has gone into the peace corps
M:	uh.
A:	and some of the are the overseas programs. uh,
M:	i see.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	so i went and i did what i could to help them along the way,
A:	yeah. yeah, that's true.
M:	but i think that's really a, a big part of it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so, uh, i, i don't know, i think, i mean, i do like the, the, uh the school systems in the city and, uh
A:	yeah, that's very true. you know, how many, is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country, and i guess, i, i live near washington, being in, in baltimore, it's something like one in four people, in the washington,  area, are lawyers,
M:	uh,
A:	and, and i just sort of think that's ridiculous.
M:	that's right.
A:	yeah, with with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and, uh, you know, the, the problems we have with aids and cancer and, and how come everybody is a lawyer, you know, you know
M:	uh, i'm, i am, i agree with you.
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	you know, i think, i don't know, there's too many cases where, uh you know it's not the person's fault that has to pay the full price.
A:	uh-huh. yeah, you saw, statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run.
M:	right.
A:	yeah, that's true.
M:	i mean, it's just that, you know, the, the lawyers are the ones that are making the decisions and the doctors,
A:	that's interesting. uh-huh.
M:	so, uh, i guess we're supposed to talk about family reunions.
A:	okay. hey, thanks so much for the conversation.
M:	yeah, you too.
A:	well, thank you very much. bye-bye.
M:	bye-bye
