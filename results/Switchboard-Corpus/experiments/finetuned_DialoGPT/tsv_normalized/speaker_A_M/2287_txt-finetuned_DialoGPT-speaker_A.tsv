M:	i i i didn't vote in that one but i uh.
A:	yeah you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
M:	well it's a it is a state law that you have to register as a gun owner and you have a gun.
A:	right or you don't know what they you know where they stand or anything like that.
M:	uh-hope not.
A:	yeah i think you're right.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so they think well you know why vote.
M:	right right. and and and i think that's really i don't know that's that that i think uh i i kind of get a kick out of that sometimes.
A:	yeah really especially in texas
M:	yeah.
A:	it really was yeah.
M:	well i'm glad to hear that because that's that's a really important aspect of education.
A:	yeah did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
M:	well i donno i really don't
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah. it also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah it's kind of like in louisiana where that uh guy that's like a ku klux klan member something got elected.
M:	right right.
A:	kind of scary when you think about that.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	oh gosh.
M:	and he's a uh a black guy that that's that i know is you know sort of a closet fascist.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah people will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected.
M:	right.
A:	next thing you know you've got him.
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	but um i don't know.
A:	right yeah.
M:	but uh
A:	yeah. right.
M:	so uh.
A:	yeah he sure did.
M:	he sure did and then um.
A:	yeah. i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
M:	yeah
A:	i think that discourages a lot of people.
M:	!!!%
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then we have a plan where uh  we vote on the local mayor
A:	right.
M:	but you have to register and and vote. and uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so it's it it really is a good thing.
A:	yeah i'm in dallas and they're long here too.
M:	oh they are.
A:	yeah i voted absentee one year. i really was going to be gone. so i did it but uh it was nice. i would be tempted to do it again.
M:	well it it is interesting though because i was uh  thinking about that the other day uh
A:	right.
M:	you can just go right ahead and get it.
A:	yeah. i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
M:	yeah
A:	i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
M:	right. that's true.
A:	uh-huh
M:	and i think that's what really works the best. i i don't know how the voting is done but i think it's done by more informed people. i don tinker with the details. i'm not sure how it's run.
A:	yeah that would be. i usually vote. a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on what issues
M:	uh well i've i have a couple of parties that i vote on. uh one of them is a woman and one of the others is a man and i i think i uh think i like the idea of uh
A:	so i'll just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote.
M:	well that's good.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and uh.
A:	no i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
M:	yeah well i do i have uh
A:	right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and i i
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh
A:	yeah.
M:	and i think that's one of the frustrating things.
A:	yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	oh yeah.
M:	and then it's like oh no no.
A:	yeah the press has a lot of power.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah oh but boy you try get into that you'd really open a can of worms.
M:	oh i know.
A:	yeah seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit and i don't think they ever care to.
M:	well i think that i mean i uh i guess i agree that uh the the i don i'm not sure i can't think of a a good example i've heard of uh oh well what do you call it? the uh
A:	well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting to talk about.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well it was good talking to you.
M:	okay bye-bye.
A:	bye.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!
