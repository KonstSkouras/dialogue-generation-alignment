M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me.
A:	i've been in the house i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so,
A:	oh, really? uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	uh-huh. well, i bet you, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  it's, uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's all custom.
A:	well, that sounds interesting. i bet he's enjoyed having it that way
M:	well it's been a pleasure talking to you.
A:	because kind of hard to find one prebuilt that 's kind of fits those specifications.
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're not quite as nice looking.
A:	well, then, most of them don't have a three car garage.
M:	right.
A:	they're kind of rare.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and it was, it was a lot of fun.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, we, i don't know, we were, we just didn't do it.
A:	uh-huh. well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, but my husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and everything.
M:	yeah.
A:	now, mine does not work on cars, he just piddles on this and that.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling things.
M:	uh-oh, uh-oh.
A:	it really is.
M:	yeah, and, uh,
A:	because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, and i, you know, i wouldn't mind having, and i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff,
M:	uh.
A:	but i, someone, i don't know, it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something.
M:	!!!;!!%!! remind me.
A:	so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would.
M:	uh, i had to sell the house.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're really trying to start a family.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and so it's, it's a lot of different things. but, uh, it is, uh
A:	uh-huh. well, i still, all three of my daughters are married, but, i don't know, i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time. and some of them coming back home and things, you know.
M:	right.
A:	and we've got grandchildren now, so when they come, they have to have a place.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	that's right, you sure don't. at times i keep thinking, though, that might be kind of nice.
M:	yeah, you, you have to be able, you really have to want to be there to be, uh, able to do something.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so, uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so.
A:	well, i don't blame you for that.
M:	no.
A:	well, i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons.
M:	oh, well that's good.
A:	and little boys are around the house a whole lot more than girls.
M:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, i enjoy them coming, but for short doses
M:	uh-hum.
A:	it feels, after they've been here ten minutes, they have already explored the entire house, they know everything.
M:	yeah.
A:	but, they're fun.
M:	yeah.
A:	well, i just watch them.
M:	yeah.
A:	i i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with them. i try to teach them not to get into things.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. at least my daughters have. they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. so it's worked pretty well. there's, i don't really think anything's been broken. every now and then we have to kind of go and say, now don't bother this you know.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but, all in all, they mind pretty well. but, i guess most of the what kind of roof does your house have? here i'm getting off the subject.
M:	uh-hue.
