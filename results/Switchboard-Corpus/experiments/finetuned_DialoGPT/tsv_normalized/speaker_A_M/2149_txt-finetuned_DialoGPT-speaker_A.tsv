M:	just just a little bit.
A:	yeah. i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i i i'd force them. i think that uh i think it would be i think i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	right exactly. i was a i was a boy scout. as part of being a boy scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an eagle scout you have to spend a do a yearlong project.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and i think uh.
A:	i think i i now i think people generally volunteer.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	that there's no problem with getting them to do stuff.
M:	no problem at all.
A:	well we have a funny commercial around here. it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world's problems or something. so  i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh
M:	yeah i guess uh.
A:	or just or just gave or or or just forced our kids just to to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess.
M:	yeah.
A:	substitute. my my yeah
M:	well that's that that would be true.
A:	my kid will do four or five hours this week for me. no problem.
M:	that's great.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh
A:	i've seen that. yeah.
M:	and uh.
A:	they they just started trying to get them something together like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently.
M:	uh-oh.
A:	you don't sound like you're in the north. you sound like you're in the south somewhere.
M:	no i'm in the uh east of dallas.
A:	yeah uh i'm in uh new york.
M:	oh really?
A:	upstate new york yeah.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh
M:	yeah i i think that uh.
A:	long way uh
M:	oh.
A:	and we just had a really big ice storm. and basically half the trees in in our city i'm in rochester which is uh right upstate. half of the trees in the city uh are no good anymore.
M:	yeah i think we had about four inches of snow on the ground in about uh uh this evening.
A:	that's how bad it was. everything is just down everywhere.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	you know we had three hundred thousand people without power.
M:	yeah.
A:	you know it was and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh yeah it's been it's been it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
M:	yeah.
A:	and were officially yeah and we're officially in a state of emergency. funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it. uh
M:	oh.
A:	yeah. i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	you know. we just got our phone back today uh and and they're you know putting out ads now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets.
M:	oh my gosh.
A:	because we have you know everywhere that a tree is down people need help and  we're all all a lot of older folks need help getting  their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and they and and they certainly can't carry it themselves
M:	yeah.
A:	and so
M:	well that's a shame because it's really it's it really is a problem.
A:	oh that's great.
M:	it's it's just uh
A:	and is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or
M:	yeah.
A:	oh so he
M:	so you know
A:	that's real nice.
M:	so it's real convenient too.
A:	right.
M:	but um
A:	that  that's real good.
M:	and uh we have uh  had real good luck with that.
A:	and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling  to be doing that.
M:	oh it sure does.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh i think it's helped a lot.
A:	that's that's uh that's real good.
M:	yeah it it really is.
A:	we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know. we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits
M:	uh-huh.
A:	some did uh some did you know big brother big sister stuff like that. and i'm convinced that that that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a some sort of group. you know activity like that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	you know. twenty-five i don't know. twenty-five percent? a asks someone else in the yeah my wife was big in that
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and she thinks yeah twenty-five percent. it it was a small school
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but uh yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do. there was big brother big sister
M:	uh-huh.
A:	they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to support that group.
M:	oh.
A:	such that you know lots of people got involved that way.
M:	well that's great.
A:	yeah.
M:	so uh it's it it was it had to be a lot of fun.
A:	yeah no neither do i. i think it should be completely optional and you know.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah they're not worth a year. or some people just just can't even afford it you know whatever. i mean the peace corps doesn't pay very well. you know?
M:	no i i think they do i do think they pay a little bit too much.
A:	people get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents i have a uh a a friend whose whose son is in the peace corps in guatemala or daughter is in the peace corps in guatemala right now.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala.
M:	yeah.
A:	you know so
M:	yeah.
A:	so i think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money.
M:	no no no.
A:	so i can see where that that may be a problem.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	just take off a year.
M:	yeah i know i think that's a a big problem and i think it's a big part of it too.
A:	yeah i don't
M:	i don't know.
A:	yeah yeah well neither can i so i i i i i i did my service before and i'll do my little community service throughout but never  never for a year again.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so so i guess our vote is no
M:	yeah.
A:	well it's been nice talking to you again.
M:	you too.
A:	well yeah we're we're slowly getting everything back together again. you know it it's taking time but everything you know
M:	it's hard to find time for all of us.
A:	we got lucky. we had no damage to our house or anything so the rest will just have to come with time.
M:	yeah well we we've been lucky. i guess i guess we're just lucky to have been able to do that. we uh we bought a new house about two and a half years ago.
A:	well good luck to you too.
M:	okay bye-bye.
A:	bye-bye or
M:	byee.
