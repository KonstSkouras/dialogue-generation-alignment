M:	and uh
A:	yeah i can i can understand that. i was raised in oklahoma and of course being oklahoman and texan uh yeah the hunting and everything and i used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all and i i did used to be all in favor of it but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs. yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing. but because i know that's not going to happen then i have to probably right up there about an eight
M:	right right.
A:	well it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. there's always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas and i know we lived in chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there. so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this. it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in. i don't know whether that's it or street gangs. i don't know what the answer is. i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well it's very true.
M:	uh i you you you know i think it's so you don't have to worry about it too much. uh i've i live in a small town in a town in mesquite
A:	it's not the law abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun it's the ones that are going out and stealing it.
M:	right.
A:	and i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. and i think that would almost have to go with armies too. i mean they'd have to be almost world-wide which we know would never ever happen.
M:	right.
A:	because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.
M:	right.
A:	that's very true very true. who knows we maybe want to overthrow the government
M:	yeah.
A:	i know if somebody doesn't do something. uh what about uh what do you think of this this uh law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait x number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun?
M:	well that's a good question. i i think it's it's been a while since i've even talked to a person about that. i think they've just uh
A:	yes.
M:	and you had to have your gun in your name. you had to go to a gun show and ask them for a driver's license.
