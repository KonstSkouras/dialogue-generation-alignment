M:	uh-huh.
A:	and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has, to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who, uh, employ these people, and pay them, uh, you know, subminimum wages or whatever, were asked to share their fair burden of this too, just as my employer is.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and myself, i guess.
M:	i guess, i, i can see where that would, would probably be a problem.
A:	well   well, who, who else is going to do this, then?
M:	uh, well, the, the other thing that, uh, that i worry about is, uh...
A:	i mean, it's worked successfully in europe.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i've heard all these stories about, i travel extensively and spend, uh, maybe half a year in europe every year,
M:	uh.
A:	and i find that the health care programs there, uh, are administered with, uh, at least people i talk to, with, uh, a great deal of integrity, and, uh, people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree.
M:	right.
A:	as a matter of fact, if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm, say in germany or france, uh, that, i'm automatically taken care of,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean i don't even have to pay.
M:	wow, that's great.
A:	well i,  uh, uh, i know it.
M:	and, uh  i don t understand why they're not doing the testing.
A:	i have a solution, you see. my solution, even though i'm rapidly approaching the, uh, the age when i'll qualify for medicare and medicaid, i, i, my mother and father both, uh, uh, well, my father's not living but my mother is,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and they are, um, of an advanced years, and when i see the money that's poured down the, down the drain on medicare and medicaid, i mean, the,  absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in,
M:	right.
A:	and the extraordinary amounts, i know that, because those people vote, i mean, they're the ones who get out and vote, that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care. the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need, and nutrition, i think,
M:	that's right.
A:	and we're spending on these useless, many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue.
A:	that's right, i mean, it does,  seem like we're,
M:	and it's amazing.
A:	now i noticed just the other day in the paper that, that medicare will be based, payments will be based not, uh, just on cost, but on cost effectiveness. so i
M:	that, that's right.
A:	well, i don't know, uh, we'll see how that goes.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment, but we'll see what happens.
M:	i don't think so.
A:	well, listen, uh, i think i've, i've exhausted my, uh, self on, at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	okay?
M:	well i, i, uh
A:	see you next time. bye.
