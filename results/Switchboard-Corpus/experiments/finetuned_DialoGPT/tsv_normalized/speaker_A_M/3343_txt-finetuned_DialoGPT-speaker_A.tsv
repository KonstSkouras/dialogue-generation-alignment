M:	and, and she's got a new computer at home, and i have to type all the things back and forth.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	right.
M:	and i usually try to get everything that i can, you, i usually go to a flea market and buy like, uh clothes from there, you can usually find some that are similar to what you're looking for.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's, it's really, it was really good. we, i guess we both sort of, sort of liked different things about each of them.
A:	of course, uh-huh.
M:	so we just, you know, left it out of the way,
A:	right
M:	and, uh, it's, uh it's a big problem,
A:	right, just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed
M:	yeah.
A:	we're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	right. right. and you usually get what you pay for. we bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for christmas, and they were like ten dollars, and we expected them to work nice for the little kids, and they didn't work worth anything
M:	right, right.
A:	so we took those back, and that's about that all that were taken back in ages.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	yeah.
M:	and you can get them for like twenty or thirty cents more, and then you can actually get a real good deal if you, if the, if, if they're real good about telling you what brand it is.
A:	right.
M:	it's like, uh.
A:	right.
M:	but, uh.
A:	oh, really. it's hard.
M:	yeah, it is.
A:	oh, wow.
M:	and you could tell, you know, it was just a terrible car.
A:	uh-huh, and it just pertained to that
M:	and it just, and i, i, you, you really have to think that it was just one of those things, you have to wonder, you've got to wonder if it was a accident or, you got lucky and you got the guy who shot that guy lucky enough to get it out.
A:	i, at first i thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what i buy, it seems like, and, uh, you know, i still don't have any, anything to do there, but, but i, i think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,
M:	yeah.
A:	so.
M:	well, that's, that, that is, that was part of my thought also.
A:	yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor, and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that
M:	yeah.
A:	but, but, it was interesting to, i don't know if they're making them better or not, i, it's hard to say. some, i think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but i think the technology is better.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	about quality.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that one.
A:	right.
M:	they're just not made as well.
A:	yeah, yeah.
M:	and i think that's what's so sad.
A:	right. well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something, so
M:	right, yeah,
A:	so. so, if we get what we what we deserve
M:	yeah.
