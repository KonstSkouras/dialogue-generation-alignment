M:	but, uh
A:	uh-huh. i agree with that.
M:	so, uh.
A:	i guess, i'm, i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and, so, i, i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, i guess, uh, compared to what i get, because i, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. i go to a state sponsored school and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, so i guess i'm kind of in debt, i, i suppose, because i don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long. my parents, i guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything, but, uh, i usually end up getting money back. i will this year anyway from a,

A:	yeah, i am i need it, too, otherwise,

A:	uh-huh. well isn't,
M:	you know, we, we don't have a state income tax. uh, we have a sales tax on everything, you know, clothing and, and buying and things like that, and that's pretty high.
A:	uh-huh, there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.
M:	yeah, and, uh.
A:	uh-huh. the taxes that people don't think about that, yeah, the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, i guess.

M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so, uh.
