A:	yes all all young americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means.
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	it's it's uh it is not a not a very long program.
A:	yeah. yeah you're probably right two years might be a little too long.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	that's right. that that would be the problem. sure would.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it. uh you know college credit you know something you know
M:	yeah
A:	i'm not sure what but
M:	well what would be your advice to a parent of a child uh to choose between college and and a college that does accept a certain amount of credits?
A:	i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind.
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	but that that kind of takes away from public service.
M:	yeah.
A:	but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know you need to report somewhere by next monday you know. i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i'm not either really.
M:	so i don know i i just i'm i guess i'm cynical about it but uh
A:	that's right.
M:	!!!!!!!'!!you know i mean i i've got a couple of hundred dollars that i'm going to use for you you're right. i just don't have the time to spend that kind of time with it.
A:	that's right.
M:	it's it's uh you really have to be very careful and watch what you buy because you can make a lot you don't want to make four thousand dollars you want to spend three hundred and fifty dollars
A:	uh-huh. that's right. absolutely. they need young families whatever
M:	yeah.
A:	they just couldn't you know take off to do that.
M:	right.
A:	oh
M:	and uh
A:	that's right uh-huh.
M:	and they're not going to be able to afford to pay for it.
A:	uh-huh it sure would. it would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh you're right there's there is so much going on that it's almost overwhelming sometimes.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	i think that's that's a good idea. i don't know it it's it seems to me that that um um.
A:	that's right. i'm not even really sure at this point in time you know what what programs are out there.
M:	uh-uh. well i'm sure they're still working on that.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and i think that's a good idea.
A:	yeah.
M:	!!!%!!!!! remind me of that now that's a good show.
A:	yeah like maybe if if there was something they could do in their own own in their own town or city yeah and not have to pull up roots and you know go somewhere half way around the world or something.
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
A:	that's right. yeah that's that's true too. that's true too.
M:	but uh
A:	yeah yeah. me neither. and you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know just sit around for their year
M:	uh-huh.
A:	or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind.
M:	right yeah i i agree.
A:	yeah it's tough. it's tough.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. yeah. i i'm not sure either. but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	i think it would be better for them to be you you get them at a at a place where they can be taught something.
A:	yeah.

A:	yeah.
M:	and then you see these really really gross things
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but you know it's it it doesn't you can't expect that they're going to read anything.
A:	right.
M:	you know and and they can say well we're all here.
A:	that's right. yeah. that's a real waste too. it really is.
M:	yeah.
A:	i don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the carter administration
M:	uh-huh.
A:	that was that was a big thing with him.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and i guess even back to kennedy as a matter of fact i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was you know really interested in things like that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i just don't hear much about it anymore. like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know.
