M:	yeah that sounds like a lot to do.
A:	well there's uh places in wisconsin. there's the apostle islands uh which are in bayfield which is a wonderful place.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and then there's also uh what we found uh in the state of uh south dakota the black hills.
M:	oh i didn't know that.
A:	and we just have this uh really good time there. one thing is they don't have mosquitoes and uh sorry to say  and uh in wisconsin we do so that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your uh you know if if you're going to go camping who wants to deal with bugs and uh
M:	oh. yeah.
A:	we found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes. they just don't have them and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. sure.
M:	and we'd have to go up there you just have to get a you have to be sure you weren't in a hurry.
A:	sure. uh-huh. sure.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	that was really called roughing it yeah. i anymore. yeah see
M:	and i i did uh.
A:	uh-huh. sure. uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	than you sure. than it when you were younger uh-huh.
M:	yeah and we were real excited when we got married and it was only a couple of weeks so.
A:	it with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday. with kids they don't care you know uh a about a lot of things. but as adults uh it's like if i don't take a shower every day i feel like you know ooh.
M:	well that's good.
A:	i i just don't feel right so. there's lots of places if you're going to go camping. k o a are wonderful. it's kind of it's kind of the uh yuppie type of camping because they have showers they have things for kids to do. they have swimming pools things like that. if you  can find uh some really nice clean uh campgrounds versus uh if you go to state parks uh
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	we have found state parks not that they're lacking but uh they're certainly not up to a standard of a k o a where it's you know a little bit cleaner. you've got the showers available. it's not you know in the same category. state parks you know you get a little bit fearful too uh you know things like that simply because it they are supposed to be patrolled but uh you know it's it's a little bit different. but so we've always kind of stayed with a k o a and then uh did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. that's the only time you really use your campground. if you're going to be gone all day long walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire to sit back and watch a fire uh to enjoy that you know and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up that kind of stuff.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did
