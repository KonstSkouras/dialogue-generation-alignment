M:	yeah.
A:	i got a friend who goes there by the way i want to talk to you about that afterward okay.
M:	yeah. well i have a friend that goes to tech also and uh she goes to uh the uh to the university of small town which is in wichita falls. and uh i mean i i don't know i've heard about it but i haven't heard about the program.
A:	yeah. yeah. was a a it's more or less a suburban school system?
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yes. that that was true for mine too. uh although i i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. you know i  think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh  you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn.
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	i mean  know
M:	you know
A:	yeah that's true. but but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  which it i mean it sounds like uh
M:	yeah
A:	now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because uh they have of these uh sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
M:	yeah
A:	but uh but uh certainly before that there were people that you know would graduate from high school and could barely read. uh and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen. you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something.
M:	yeah.
A:	but these people obviously weren't.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and i'm sure that uh...
A:	yeah. and i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably. i mean i don't i think you know people just
M:	yeah well i i mean i don tinker with drugs but i uh i do uh
A:	yeah. and again i don't i mean got know the you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. uh you know sort sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school.  you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue.
A:	i think that'd be an interesting experience. but uh i haven't done that
M:	yeah i i've heard of it.
A:	but i do i do think that uh i mean public education in general i think can work. and i think it's a good thing.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	and i'm not sure how well that is.
A:	yes.
M:	and they could have had a lot more money.
A:	yeah. yeah. i mean i don't i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in. mean
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and i don i think i'd like to see them i wish they'd start with you first of all you get into the uh public schools and then you get to the private ones.
A:	yeah. i mean and and in the once you junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels. well no i guess it in junior high it was still three. then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects. uh which
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean actually i think that works pretty well. and that that makes
