M:	uh, yes.
A:	so, what are your thoughts on dining out?
M:	well, i guess i, i kind of like having a variety. i, uh i, like having, uh  you know, some, you know steak and lobster places,
A:	not for the price?
M:	no, not for the cost.
A:	okay.
M:	but i think that's just because i have to have my eyes on it, you know.
A:	uh-huh. the really? okay.
M:	!!!%!! translated it's, it's really, it, it really is good.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're, you know, they're all basically the same.
A:	my word, it's like mama in the back kitchen, huh?
M:	oh, it was, it really was.
A:	oh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh, it was, it, it had a nice touch to it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  they had, uh a really nice dinner party.
A:	okay.
M:	but, uh.
A:	wow. and where was that at, near your,
M:	it's in addison, just west of addison.
A:	where, is it in dallas?
M:	uh, richardson.
A:	is it in the phone book?
M:	!!!%!! translated it's in the, uh in the book, and it's,
A:	do you know how to spell it?
M:	oh, i don't know how.
A:	okay.
M:	it's a, it's a spell. it's like raisers, like raiser tops, like tennis shoes.
A:	kalli , k a l l i? okay.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh, section, yes, uh-huh.
M:	okay, i'm, uh.
A:	what about fast foods? do you have a preference if you were going to, eat a fast food?
M:	well, i like, uh.
A:	you do, like arby's? see i don't like arby's.
M:	yeah.
A:	no, because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever. they use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver and they, they form it, and they make it look like roast beef, and i said, no, thank you.
M:	wow.
A:	well, that's not what i heard, from one of, somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about.
M:	no.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i was thinking, well, that sounds wonderful.
A:	really?
M:	yeah.
A:	unless somebody is trying to blackball them.
M:	yeah, i know. i, i, uh, i don't, i mean, i'm not really for gun control, i just think it should be, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so, i don't know, i guess it's just, i think it's, i just feel like it's kind of an over reaction, but i guess i don tinker too much with it.
A:	okay.
M:	and, uh, and, uh  and we, we, uh we go to the, uh the fast food ones.
A:	how about the health food, uh, restaurants? well, like this one but it's probably not advertised as such, is it? or,
M:	uh, it's not, it, it isn't.
A:	uh-huh. health food, uh, restaurants that,
M:	uh, i guess we have to talk about the food though.
A:	well well, like, um, well, i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between.
M:	yeah.
A:	but they ought, there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious. you know, as far as their cholesterol levels and their, their fat content and, you know, the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them. now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called rodolfo's over on preston road and royal lane i believe.
M:	uh-uh.
A:	and they have very good food over there.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh. they do list, um, you know, list the fat,
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	but i don't know.
A:	well, it was pretty reasonable. i, it was around ten dollars for lunch. okay, which is kind of high for lunch i guess.
M:	yeah, yeah, that's, that, that would be a little bit too much for a dinner party, but,
A:	yes.
M:	well i, i, uh, i like to cook, uh
A:	yes, uh-huh.
M:	yeah, i've been to, uh, a few of the fairs.
A:	yeah. uh, but, um, you were served by maitre d's and, and, uh, um, men waiters.
M:	right.
A:	well, if you're looking for a nice, uh-huh. well, i guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant. it's a special occasion, type thing.
M:	uh-hue.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh. and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	because they're, well, they have lunch specials that you can't, you can't beat that price, uh, if you went to a cafeteria.
M:	!!!;!!%!!that's right.
A:	well, i had the, i had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent. it was a marinated, broiled chicken breast and it was
M:	uh-uh.
A:	oh, it was,
M:	i would, i would love to have a chicken breast, you know,
A:	well, i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north and that was a no no.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and i haven't gotten over that from the north.
M:	really?
A:	i know they say that, that is,
M:	you know, i mean, it's, it, it really is good for you to eat it.
A:	but i'm, but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and so i kind of stay
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	because of all the pollution in the lakes and the, everywhere. i mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish.
M:	yeah.
A:	and especially, uh, in wisconsin and michigan they say, no, buying of our fish.
M:	yeah.
A:	i, well, yeah. so i am, and the, the best brand of chicken to buy is the, uh, pilgrim pride because they don't use all these hormones to remote , uh, unnatural growth in their products.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so i mean, we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy.
M:	right.
A:	so i'm, i, you know, i,
M:	uh, yeah, i don't know. i, i think, uh.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. corrode. huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	well, i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, dear.
M:	yeah.
A:	wow.
M:	so,
A:	sure. yeah.
M:	and it's not like it used to be.
A:	that's right. everything we eat. everything, everything we eat should have a label on it
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	i don't know. i don't, i donno, i, i just think it's, uh, i think it, it's a problem. i think the, the government's, it seems to me that they're trying to control it and everything, you just, you don't want everybody to think that you're, you're the boss, and you're supposed to think about what you're doing and what you can do to fix it.
A:	well, you know,
M:	but i think that's,
A:	well, becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,
