M:	yeah and i have a i have i live on one of the outskirts of dallas.
A:	okay. yeah.
M:	!!!%!! remind me. this is going to sound familiar but uh.
A:	no that's okay
M:	no.
A:	okay.
M:	and uh.
A:	oh that's neat.
M:	and uh.
A:	wow that's large
M:	it really is.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but the area that i am in it is quite large. uh-homing.
A:	oh well that's not too bad
M:	yeah.
A:	that's still fairly new.
M:	yeah but it's it was you had to you knew you needed to get it serviced you didn't have to put it on rusted out
A:	well
M:	and it's not even the square footage that's uh.
A:	oh you're kidding well do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there i mean what it's
M:	yeah it's really funny i i've uh i've been down there and seen uh
A:	okay.
M:	but uh.
A:	it it sounds like i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean dallas is a very marked up area although right now it's a lot lower um because of all the layoffs and everything
M:	uh yeah.
A:	the economy around here is real poor
M:	uh.
A:	well no not really
M:	i don't think so.
A:	um the area itself uh the fort worth dallas area um has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including texas instruments
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	um there's been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs so really housing is real bad. the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad but housing is still real bad
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	i don't know.
A:	yeah. this is
M:	it's it's a it it really is.
A:	oh.
M:	but uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	oh.
M:	but uh.
A:	wow.
M:	and uh it it was a tremendous amount of work.
A:	so do you think it was overdeveloped then?
M:	uh i think it was but i think the the people who were opposed to it said that it was a failed test and that we needed to do something about it.
A:	wow.
M:	and uh.
A:	um.
M:	it's uh it it seems to me that the that the immigration of america has uh uh uh been a problem for a long time and that uh...
A:	um yeah. yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	well right now we're just renting but it is a home. um
M:	a home a home that's not a you know a condominium or anything.
A:	it's a four bedroom home it has about i guess eighteen hundred square feet it's on one floor
M:	uh.
A:	uh we have no basement i don't know
M:	well that's nice.
A:	okay i wasn't sure. most of the ones you know up north and everything do but um anyway it's uh it's pretty also pretty typical for the area. most of this area was developed this house was built in seventy-four.
M:	!!!% oh really?
A:	so most of the it's almost twenty years old and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
M:	uh uh-homing.
A:	but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. so i i think most of them are there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from
M:	uh.
A:	and and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area for probably a square mile i'd say at least maybe even a little bit more than that.
M:	yeah.
A:	where are you in relation to sevren? are you close to sevren?
M:	uh i am in dallas.

A:	well i just
M:	i don't know i've only been up here a couple of weeks so i don't have much time to go to the beach.
A:	i have a sister that used to live in sevren.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	and they bought their home in i i want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that and they paid like they they had it built from you know they they designed it and everything and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
M:	oh my word.
A:	yeah so i just wondered you know if the whole area was like that or
M:	!!!%!!that's the whole thing.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh i don't know. i uh.
A:	um.
M:	so i i really wanted to get one. i you you would think you'd think that you wouldn't have to worry about getting a condominium but you're right it's just it would be nice.
A:	yeah.
M:	but it was it had a very modern feel to it.
A:	sounds like a lot of money though
M:	oh yeah.
A:	sure. yeah.
M:	but uh i don't know.
A:	right. oh yeah.
M:	and uh you don't have to pay any income tax.
A:	wow. yeah.
M:	but you're right it it does seem that that you see more and more of the uh the less fortunate people are becoming more selfish and less responsible.
A:	wow wow that's
M:	!!! remind me of that house.
A:	really? that much of a difference?
M:	uh i think i i'm not sure i really don't know.
A:	wow.
M:	yeah it it really does it makes you think.
A:	yeah
M:	but um it it just it was a it had to be put up. i mean it did not you know it really didn't it didn't do anybody any good i i think it wasn't
A:	wow. why is that? do you know? i mean
M:	well you're you know you pay a hundred and fifty five dollars for state tax in texas.
A:	uh-huh
M:	but they have no incentive to uh uh  you know to to do anything.
A:	oh.
M:	and uh so you know it's it costs you almost twice as much as living costs.
A:	oh
M:	but
A:	my goodness
M:	and uh.
A:	wow
M:	and uh.
