M:	yeah, i, i live right by there,
A:	well, good to hear. i was just talking to someone the other day from pennsylvania.
M:	oh, that's nice.
A:	really?
M:	yeah.
A:	all right. well, good to hear, good to hear.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	which one?
M:	i don't know, i'm blank on it.
A:	oh, yeah.
M:	they, they, they're in it for a year.
A:	the utah jazz.
M:	!!!%
A:	yeah, they're, they're pretty good. they've got some good good, some good, uh, good players out there.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, you ready for new year's eve?
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	good. should we, uh, start this so we can,
M:	yeah,
A:	what was your name again?
M:	uh, i, i don't know if you've ever heard of us.
A:	nancy, that's right,
M:	yeah, i think we might have to do that.
A:	and i'm brian.
M:	oh, you're not.
A:	just a moment okay nancy, then i guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary.
M:	yes.
A:	what, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits?
M:	well, i guess, uh, i, i really don't have a great, great deal of, uh knowledge on benefits. i do know that there are certain things that are, uh that are really, uh uh, uh, uh, really, really important to the, uh the employees, like, uh health insurance and that type of thing.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, i, i have a good friend who has a, uh a plan that he's trying to get started on.
A:	oh
M:	and i have, i have the social security which i use for, uh, my social security number,
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh.
M:	so i, i try to work full-time and, uh, i have a two income family and so that works out pretty good because i'm able to, you know, go to work when i want to and i'm not stuck with the kids all day.
A:	to, to compensate for some of the benefits.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh.
M:	well, that's, that, that is a really good idea. that's something i hadn't thought about. i,
A:	yes.
M:	and, uh, i, i do feel that, uh.
A:	well, that, that's an excellent, so actually that is a benefit, uh,
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	so i would say that is an advantage of being a, a teacher.
A:	right. right, well i guess that's a good point, uh,
M:	and, uh.
A:	i do belong to a, a large corporation or my, that where i'm currently employed and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
M:	uh.
A:	and that got to be somewhat expensive, so i i think one of the benefits i, i see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount.
M:	uh, i think that's wonderful.
A:	yes.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	yes, and that's, that's one thing i do have.
M:	i'm going to have to remember that.
A:	if i didn't have a family, i don't think i would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, i don't think i would have insurance, uh, other,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i don't think i would go through that expense. one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job, i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work, uh, nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours
M:	uh-huh.
A:	or i could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. and make, uh, make my job flexible in that case.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, basically, yeah i had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. i mean uh, because i was in a, in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that, uh, i needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so, so i, i think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	and i don't have that in my current operation, but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule and that's, that's good.
M:	uh, i,
A:	and, uh, what other benefits do you think are important?
M:	well, the, uh the, the most important thing for me, i guess, is, uh i'm, i'm in the medical field.
A:	yeah, yeah, that's true.
M:	i'm not real sure what they're going to do with it.
A:	well, and that's an individual thing.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah, with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. if we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times
M:	uh, uh-homing.
A:	and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that,
