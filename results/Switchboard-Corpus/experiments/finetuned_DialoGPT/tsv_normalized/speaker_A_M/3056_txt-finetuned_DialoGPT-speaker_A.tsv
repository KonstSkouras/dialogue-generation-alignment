M:	and, uh it's a, it's an autobiography.
A:	who wrote that?
M:	 scott peck and, uh
A:	huh.
M:	and he, he, uh he had these memos prepared for this, and, uh and it, it was just, uh.
A:	i see.
M:	and, and, and the thing is, is, it, it's, it was, it is very difficult for a burglar to get in, in a house like that, and it,
A:	well, that is interesting. right.
M:	and, uh  i have a friend who was a vietnam veteran and he, uh you know she, she had, she was on a diet plan and, you could tell she was in her early forties.
A:	that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's, it was good.
A:	and, they have not made a movie of the week of it yet.
M:	uh,
A:	yeah.
M:	it's, uh, it's really good.
A:	uh. explained , *listen; could be br
M:	yeah, it was, it, it really was a fascinating book. it was about, you know, uh how to recognize different types of trees and, uh and what to look for when you go to put them in different areas.
A:	supposedly scooped up by the triangle.
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	so, uh.
A:	yeah. on that same topic, have you ever read anything about, you know, the amelia earhart story, whatever happened with her?
M:	!!!%!! remind me!!;!!'!!if!!you!!that's the only thing i didn't think was a big deal, i thought, i didn tinker too much with it, i just, i had the whole, the whole thing, you get the idea. you don't, you don't know what you're doing. you just sit around and, and, you, you do the exercises and, uh.
A:	i, i think that would be, i am sure there is something out there, uh, ,
M:	it's, it, it is interesting. uh, i, i'm not sure how you would go about getting rid of a, a guilty person. i guess you would have to get them off.
A:	i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years.
M:	yeah.
A:	well whatever, this is one aspect of it.
M:	yeah.
A:	of course, you know, it is so weird, cause no one will ever really know, it's, it, so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things.
M:	right.
A:	that is for sure.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh,
A:	right. well, i, i guess i just have not read i mean, usually, i just, if i find a good book, i will sit, you know, for two days until it is finished. if it's that good,
M:	yeah, that's the way i am. i like books that are long.
A:	and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's and that was presumed innocent.
M:	!!!%!! scottthurow!!hey!!you know, that's a real good one.
A:	and i just really, really liked the way he writes. it's just, incredible.
M:	yeah, i think he's written some really interesting things. i think they're all,
A:	yeah.
M:	i was just absolutely,
A:	uh.
M:	and, uh it's, it's just like, it was, uh  it was just like a, a real strange book.
A:	that was good, i think. and, and the other book i am trying to think, you know, like was in the last year and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity, uh,
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	bon yeah.
M:	of the, the, of the vans of dreams
A:	uh. yeah i, that was really, really good, the movie was nothing compared to the book.
M:	oh, yeah. the book was great.
A:	and. yeah.
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	oh, the movie was a joke compared to, i mean, because tom wolfe is so perceptive, when it comes to, you know, pinpointing, uh, society's ills and, things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things
M:	oh. oh, yeah.
A:	and, and so, it was, it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	and, anyway, we are not talking about that, but, uh, gee, i just i like to read gardening books and things like that. just to tell me what to do with my garden and, uh, and, uh,
M:	well, i, i love gardening, but i don't really like to do any of that at all.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	like, what is a book on your list, you know i have a list too and i have never gotten to it
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh.
M:	so i, you, you kind of get a, you get a feel for what's going on and, you like the story line and all that. but, uh.
