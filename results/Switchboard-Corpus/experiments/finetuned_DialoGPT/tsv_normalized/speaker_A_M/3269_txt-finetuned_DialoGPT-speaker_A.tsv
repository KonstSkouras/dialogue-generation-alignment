M:	so, i guess i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	well, they haven't, they haven't, have they just lost one game this year?
M:	uh, yeah, they just beat the saints.
A:	two.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	yeah. but they're not doing bad. people are pretty surprised that they, i mean they beat the giants.
M:	well, you know, i, i don't know if i would have said that about the cowboys. i think they're doing pretty good.
A:	i bet
M:	and, uh, i didn't get to see it.
A:	oh, boy, i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
M:	oh yeah, they were.
A:	yep.
M:	you know, so,
A:	yeah. yeah, well, i am, i'm a big football fan. i never my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and i just hated it. and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, so when i met my husband, he was watching football and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend. i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football, if i didn't, like football. so,
M:	yeah, monday was the one that jumped up and pushed me.
A:	yep.
M:	so,
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	uh-huh. well, i do. i just, i love it. it's such, i just think it's such a fun sport. and, uh, i'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet. we're not convinced that we're going to be cowboy fans yet. but, uh,
M:	yeah, i think they'll probably do pretty well. they're going, they're going pretty well and, uh.
A:	well, i guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here
M:	well i think so too.
A:	that's even harder. but,
M:	that, that's true. that's true, that would be hard.
A:	no, we're just, this is only the second place we've lived. we've only been married for five and a half years. and, uh, we have two small children, and he had a, uh, just got transferred here to e-systems, so.
M:	oh, uh-huh.
A:	oh. well, i tell you this, the weather here and there's no mountains or anything, you know, and when you go to a football game in colorado that's, you know, there's snow and it's an adventure and here, yeah you've just got to drive down to the, to the stadium
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh,
M:	yeah, i, i've, i used to go to, uh raiders games a lot when they were in town.
A:	yes.
M:	we're going to have to put up signs and say, no telephone books.
A:	well, he's from here.
M:	yeah, he is.
A:	that's what i hear.
M:	he's a pretty decent guy.
A:	which is rare.
M:	uh, i don't know, i've, i'm not that big a person, but i've never been that angry about the cowboys, you see.
A:	which is good. yeah. but, uh, i, you know, it's funny in, in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last, i don't know, five or six years whatever it's been. um, they have these songs on the radio. they take popular songs and, and change them to fit, uh, the broncos and stuff.
M:	right.
A:	and they had, i was just thinking about one the other day. uh, if i saw a picture of john elway in the, in the cafeteria at school, um, but they did the johnny angel. they did johnny elway to that.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	and, and i was trying to get my son to sing that. my husband was just having a fit to sound like her don't have him sing that song but, they, they do a lot of fun things. i think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that i think you kind of, it's hard not to like it. because you know there's just,
M:	yeah.
A:	it's exciting.
M:	i mean, you know, it really is. i mean, it is.
A:	yeah.
M:	i like to watch that.
A:	yeah. yeah, they i, i wish i would have bought the tape when i was in, uh, in colorado. because, uh, i, i think about that a lot. but, you know, when i first moved here was when they, well, no, i guess it was about a year ago they did this. this interstate seventy-five song. or whatever it was about central expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety-five and everything.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	that was kind of a funny song but they sure do, it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here. even when they were losing pitifully, you know, people still support them. we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs, we love the
