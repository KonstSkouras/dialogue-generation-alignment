M:	yeah, it's, uh
A:	uh,
M:	well, i, i work in the legal department and i, uh i work on, uh, speech, uh speech, recognition systems.
A:	uh-huh. me too. i work at, uh, the georgia tech research institute.
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
A:	um, i'm a co-op student so i work and go to school about halftime. and, uh, i really don't have any job benefits to speak of. we're kind of, um, i don't know, they just kind of forget us on that end. we don't really have any vacation or, you know, sick days or health care or anything really so.
M:	yeah. well, that's, that, that sounds like you guys are pretty well employed then.
A:	exactly. exactly.
M:	i'm, i, i guess i'm pretty lucky because i work for a university.
A:	what about you?
M:	well, i work at a university.
A:	huh.
M:	and, uh they, um.
A:	yeah. uh, they do that i think if you're, uh, research here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that, um, they might, you know, pay for that.  pay for the classes and stuff
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	but i know they let you, they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by kind of percentage. you know, they'll let you work halftime if you want to, if you want to finish,
M:	uh, uh-hue.
A:	you want to, yeah. they'll let you work, decrease your number of hours by any percentage just, just about so if you want to get your masters and then, i think of course you get like a, with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so that will probably help out.
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	yeah. yeah, i think, i mean that's pretty, that's a pretty important, uh, part of it there because that, that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems. my dad, i think my, i'm still covered on, with my dad's, uh, health plan at his, where he works, but it would definitely be something to look into once i get my own.
M:	well, i guess i, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think it's going to be really hard for everybody to find a good program, uh.
A:	the i think the, i guess the only real, um, benefit i guess you could say working, for me working here, besides i mean i'm learning and stuff because,  i'm at, you know, in school.
M:	yeah.
A:	but there's, there's some where, uh, uh, student employees working for the government don't have to pay social security tax. that's about, five percent right there
M:	!!!!,!!!.!!etwork!!%!!eting!!?!!i!!you!!iful!!so, you're, you, you work for texas instruments?!you do!!that's great!!oh!!
A:	so.
M:	well, that's good.
A:	that's about the only real bonus
M:	yeah.
A:	i have, so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid you know, because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to, you know, pay an extra five percent,  or so.
M:	right. right.
A:	huh. yeah.
M:	but i guess that's the only thing i see changing, is that, uh, people are more willing to sacrifice their time and energy to benefit society rather than, uh
A:	oh, yeah?
M:	and, um.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i mean, i'm sure that, you, you don't want to go out and, and buy something, but you want to do it, you need to do that.
A:	help a lot. yeah. see around, around here it's like, uh, we pretty much work from project to project on, well, you know, with different sponsors.
M:	yeah.
A:	there's not, there is not a whole lot of, you know, funded research from,
