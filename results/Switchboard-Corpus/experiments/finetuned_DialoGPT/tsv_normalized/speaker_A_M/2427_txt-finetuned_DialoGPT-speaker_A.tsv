M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh i see.
M:	and they had a big roast last year and it was fantastic.
A:	okay. we don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	probably so. yeah you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	i guess it it might would

M:	so i mean it's it can be a real problem.
A:	sure.
M:	and uh and the kids just love it.
A:	yeah.
M:	but i don't do any of that. i do uh like uh i i have a little seedling you know that i that grows like crazy.

M:	it really is.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then i'll get it ready and then just leave it in the tub.
A:	i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard. i i really don't enjoy doing that. i enjoy having a nice looking yard
M:	uh uh-hue.
A:	i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done.
M:	yeah.
A:	i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired
M:	uh.
A:	and now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to for the last couple of years i've done it myself.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	it is kind of expensive it is.
M:	well that's true but i think you know it's a matter of of uh
A:	of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too.
M:	right.
A:	that's right. if i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
M:	well you're right. i i you you probably have a better solution than what's been offered.
A:	that's right.
M:	but you you have to go out and do it.
A:	that's right. i'm i'm kind of bad about that.
M:	yeah well i mean i've had uh a couple of times when i've uh
A:	i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really can't i really you know don't  want to spend the money for it.
M:	oh no. oh no no
A:	yeah. that's right. i'm not limited to just mowing it on saturday morning you know
M:	oh yeah.
A:	i can do it on most any day of the week.
M:	yeah i know i i just i'm i am a real good gardener i enjoy it when i do it. i don't like to mow it i guess because i think it's too messy.
A:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	but uh i don't know i i just i find it a little boring you're right. it's it's uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	they'll say oh i'm sorry this is not easy this isn't easy.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and then you know the the news the t v the kids are usually in bed by that time.
A:	that's coming up here pretty soon. is it this weekend?
M:	uh no it's probably next weekend.
A:	it's pretty soon.
M:	yeah i'm i've been waiting for a i guess it's been delayed but i'm not sure whether they'll call it twelve angry or not.
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh
A:	i believe it is too.
M:	but uh.
A:	well
M:	i think that's what i heard too. i don't know what the exact figures are but i know they range i mean it's like anywhere from a hundred thousand to a thousand.
A:	uh not a whole lot uh. i i don't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then again i don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
M:	no no no. it's not that big a deal.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but i had some that were you know just really bad you just you didn't know what you were getting into.
A:	uh-huh. right. uh-huh.
M:	and they're just wonderful tasting i mean you can just taste the goodness in them.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh you know the the texture of it is just wonderful.
A:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	and i went and i took it back and i put it back in the middle of the garden and it was dead.
A:	absolutely. they really go through it
M:	yeah. i think i think that's a wonderful thing.
A:	they really do. yeah.
M:	and and uh you know and i i it's something that uh i think it would be very difficult for me to completely understand.
A:	you know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
M:	yeah.
A:	boy they'll strip
M:	oh no.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and
A:	i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before i've got my garden is shaped that i can it's kind like this uh box shape so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
M:	uh-hum.
A:	and you know various other things raised it up.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me.
A:	and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have oh i'll have less of a bug problem at least they they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
M:	yeah i know.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so i i decided that that's not going to be a problem.
A:	yeah right.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's it's not very uh uh green
A:	that's right you you have to work on. you really do.
M:	yeah i know.
A:	that's right. when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden so i had i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with
M:	uh-uh. uh-hum.
A:	no. i don't i did it by hand
M:	oh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	how about you?
A:	it wasn't too much of a job  really.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	like i say it's just
M:	i don't know. i don't i donno i think it's really good. i mean it's not like they're going you know they're robbing people and then they're putting their stuff in people's houses.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. it would be handy.
M:	well i i do enjoy gardening.
A:	yeah.
M:	but it's real easy to get the little one to pull the weeds and get to them.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh it it is really it's a really good deterrent.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh so it's it's nice to have a little variety you know.
A:	it might be handy
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh it's got a built in pulley system.
A:	they're pretty neat little i've never seen one.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. oh yeah.
M:	but uh it's a pretty neat car.
A:	yeah. uh-huh right. yeah. that would be neat sure.
M:	but uh yeah i'm not i don't know i think i'm going to have to get one in a while i just i need to put money on it i guess.
A:	we've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know
M:	uh-hum.
A:	i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh got you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
M:	uh.
A:	and uh i've got carrots i yes i've got a few carrots up and i've got some radishes up
M:	uh.
A:	and as a matter of fact i've already done a second row of radishes.
M:	oh.
A:	and uh the green onions are coming along.
M:	yeah that's what we're trying to decide we're we've been trying to think we went to get some of the squash and we're going to try to get the uh carrots too.
A:	snow
M:	yeah i think that's the first thing i want is snow to fall so i can get back in the mountains.
A:	excuse me.
M:	!!!%!! translated it's snowing on the west side of colorado right?
A:	yes i've for the first time we planted them this year.
M:	oh that's wonderful.
A:	yeah. we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but we've got some this year.
M:	you're lucky.
A:	snow peas are up and uh my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side.

A:	oh i bet
M:	i bet.
A:	they were. that's right. we use a lot we sure do.
M:	i know.
A:	yeah. one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. uh-huh. we did that too
M:	and uh we put we just put them in the freezer.
A:	uh-huh. sure. makes uh makes a colorful salad too.
M:	!!!% that's right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then i uh
A:	we planted some yellow peppers this year. we've tried it before
M:	uh.
A:	and nope we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
M:	yeah it's just so full of things that you can eat.
A:	they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah. we enjoy fooling around with it.
M:	well that's good.
A:	beets. yeah we've got some beets uh-huh.
M:	and uh.

M:	oh you did?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i don't know if i'll ever get rid of them.
A:	it takes a yeah it does take some space.
M:	i think it's a big waste of money  to keep somebody else's garbage
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh. i see.
M:	but i'm i'm not i don't know i think we're going to have to do too much to our food

M:	but uh we're we've we we do uh we do have a garden but we don't have it right now.
A:	uh-huh. that will be neat yeah.
M:	and uh we are we were thinking about that the other day and uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh we've got a pretty good size root tree and we put them in there every year. we have a pretty small porch and i think it's uh
A:	that will be neat yeah. absolutely they're expensive.
M:	yeah and and they and we got a couple of those little um. they're they have the rounded bottom lid on them.
A:	i don't know unless it labor intensive or something. i really don't know.
M:	yeah.
A:	that will be interesting.
M:	yeah and and it's just it's not that i want to cut the garden or anything but i want it to be something that i can enjoy and i can make and serve and
A:	yeah.
M:	well that's interesting. well i guess we're supposed to discuss crime in america aren't we?
A:	sure. yeah.
M:	but i'm i'm pretty much the same way. i i've got a i have a a nineteen eighty-nine honda civic which is you you wouldn't believe i mean i you'd say it's a dream car but i've had it for about four years now
A:	that's interesting.
M:	yeah and i i think it's really neat because it's a different way of looking at it you see.
A:	well i'll let you go it's
