A:	uh, very good.
M:	and so i try and, uh.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	um, i do, i have, uh, one son who's a sophomore in high school.
A:	yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. i know, my son is a biker and he, he's done the whole canal, i think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	and so, but that somehow takes, organization. for me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, i can, i can do some of my reading,
M:	uh.
A:	um, but,
M:	well, i've never done that before.
A:	no, i live in maryland.
M:	oh, you do?
A:	right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops so i do. now, i think, um, basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?
M:	well, because, um. well, i like exercise, i enjoy it, but i, i don't like to go out and do it. i, uh, i have a problem with it, i, you know, i can't handle it any more.
A:	uh-huh, right. i think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.
M:	yes, it is.
A:	oh, well, that's great, that's great.
M:	so, i'm, i've been doing a lot of, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but then after that it starts, it starts to build up again.
A:	right. and actually in, in summer i like to swim. we don't have facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when i go home from work at the end of the day, if i go up for an hour in the pool, i'm much, much more awake, i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
M:	uh, that is good.
A:	so.
M:	well, that's interesting.
A:	no, i'm not.
