A:	right, as a matter of fact, i was thinking that same thing, unconditional love. they just give it, and don't expect too much.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	anyway, do you have a pet?
M:	yes, i do.
A:	oh! like a
M:	uh, it was a cat and it was, it, it hit the car right in the middle of me, and i just couldn't believe it.
A:	oh, i'm so sorry. but that's good that you're going to get another one.
M:	well, it was, it really was.
A:	i know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that i know, that have pets. but they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, an, and my, my kids,
M:	so that's kind,
A:	um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything i think
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but, um, i don't know do you like, i guess your cat was an indoor cat.
M:	uh, yeah,
A:	it kind of traveled around travel .
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, when i had a cocker spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog and, uh, i think i liked that better.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, that's true.
M:	i mean, i mean, they're, they, they take up so much space in the house, and i,
A:	yeah, that's true. take them for walks, right. yeah, i see all the people on, on sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and i, i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, i'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe,
M:	yeah.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. so, i
M:	yeah that's, that, that would be nice.
A:	oh, that's exciting. yeah.
M:	so i was kind of looking for something a little more, uh, challenging,
A:	yeah, i think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
M:	well, that, uh  that's a big part of it.
A:	that, that kind of gripes on me some, but, but i don't know.
M:	i think, uh.
A:	more and more people are, right, right.
M:	and that's a, that's the way it's going to be.
A:	but, uh,
M:	i think it's a wonderful thing, though.
A:	i think that's really true.
M:	i, i think that was one of the things that i, i was really interested in when i was younger, was in pet raising.
A:	yeah.
M:	you don't have to worry about them being thrown in the dumpster, you just have to deal with it.
A:	yeah, exactly.
M:	so, i don't know, it's, it seems like there's a lot of things that need to be done about, uh, recycling.
A:	exactly. i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too, and, and that's good too.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, i think that's all i have to say.
M:	okay, well, thank you.
A:	okay, have a good night. all right, bye-bye.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
