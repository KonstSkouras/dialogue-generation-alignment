M:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh i'm in california  which has a lot of immigration. probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and um i've got two children  and two stepdaughters.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and uh you know they're all all learning levels.
A:	yeah. sure well texas  used to be part of mexico or most of it
M:	uh
A:	huh.
M:	!!!% well i'll let you go.
A:	i i don't either. it's a really delicate uh moral issue. because if you have well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation to  to get them on their feet.
M:	uh-huh. right.
A:	because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever. and i know that that the southeast asians the hmong people that i've done some work with uh feel very quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here. because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically. and they're being plunked down plunked down into america. many of them had been promised by the c i a during the war over there that because they co-operated with the c i a and they helped the c i a out that when they came here the c i a would help establish them in america and the c i a of course isn't doing that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and uh so they come here and they don't know what the heck they're doing. and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities. and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and they're they're incredible victims of crime. and part of it is this lack of  lack of basic information being dissimilated . and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on.
M:	yeah. yeah.
A:	uh yeah exactly.
M:	i i think it's uh.
A:	i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like.
M:	right.
A:	um and it's it's i i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them. and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information they don't have. and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know. people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know. like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it. but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know. why can't they? they have no idea why not some some of them you know. the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now. but when they initially come over
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah
M:	yeah.
A:	'cause they're farmers. these  are all farmers coming over
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and they're being put in the middle of the city
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue.
A:	these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before. you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war. and uh they have you know. so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the american way. because if they don't you're just going to produce you know you're going to produce an underclass you know. you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then. and there was no  real up upward movement.
M:	yeah.
A:	and not being you know
M:	uh not having any background knowledge on on uh black people in the work force.
A:	um
M:	and the other thing is is you see these these um these young people that are just starting to get married and have their careers and all this
A:	well
M:	oh that's nice.
A:	i i wasn't helping them. i worked with them not to help them but for my own purposes. i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit. and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me. but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that.
M:	oh you did.
A:	i do have friends who have tried to do more  social work   you know by explaining to people how the language  and what the problems learning english might be and such.
M:	right. uh-huh.
A:	because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers. and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are.
M:	right.
A:	oh you are?
M:	uh
A:	uh-huh well you
M:	and you have to have a computer to do that.
A:	that's that's been my impression.
M:	and uh i know uh-hope you know we're going to have to do something in the next couple of years uh.
A:	yeah. it's it's not they're not withholding information
M:	uh-uh.
A:	they just don't have that information.
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	they they haven't the foggiest idea.
M:	that's true.
A:	yes.
M:	and i've been with the company a couple of times and uh it's it it works out pretty well.
A:	and spanish is  pretty close to english really.
M:	right.
A:	and spanish is a lot like english.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and uh so we we uh we try to keep that in mind you know because uh you know we try and you can't always get everything.
A:	yeah yeah. yeah.
M:	and then  and you you're like well  i don't know.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh. uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	i i really like that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh  and i think it's a wonderful thing that that the school can offer that kind of exposure to uh uh other cultures.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	i i think that's the only way i can really help direct my my opinion on it.
A:	oh i'm sure it would.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	but uh it i think it varies uh.
A:	yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure. very much. and and i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble. i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth.
M:	right.
A:	they became a very successful immigrant group. but and but a lot of people coming over from vietnam right now coming from worn torn countries are are not having the same success. i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful? the japanese were or the chinese were or something. and it's really much more complicated.
M:	well i i think it's true that that the the japanese you you have to think about uh the uh you know the what what's the how can you do it?
A:	yeah the times are different yeah.
M:	you know i mean they didn't have the ability to be successful you just had to go out and do what you had to do.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and uh you know that's that that is that really is a different situation.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so you know he just kind of goes over there and joins in and helps them learn the language  you know.
A:	oh yeah. i i think it's a wonderful thing to do. and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it uh  more of the volunteer network service.
M:	!!!% yeah that's true. that's true
A:	because everyone gains from it.
M:	right.
A:	would be would might be really useful. uh and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes makes the community so much happier.
M:	!!!% well i know i uh i've seen some of the programs on uh uh t v where they uh they offer programs like uh to recycle. you know like the uh the the little uh aluminum can bottles and stuff like that.
A:	uh-huh. yes.
M:	and uh.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	i mean they're they have a lower level of intelligence lower level lower salaries lower crime rate you name it they don't have the social skills that uh
A:	yes yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country. i mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak english no one thinks anything of you.
M:	that's true.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and she was she was selling drugs and she was caught just just you know just a few weeks later i mean it was just a couple of weeks later.
A:	yeah i do too. well it's been good talking with you.
M:	okay good talking to you. take care.
A:	uh okay.
M:	bye-bye.
A:	okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of
M:	well they're they're both grown now so.
A:	uh okay bye-bye.
M:	bye-bye
