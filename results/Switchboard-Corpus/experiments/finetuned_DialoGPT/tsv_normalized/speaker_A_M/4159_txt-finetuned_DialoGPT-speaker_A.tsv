M:	and so, you, you can't really make judgments based on that, based on one person, you're not, you have to make judgments on six people.
A:	right.
M:	and then the judge decides whether or not it's, uh.
A:	right. they
M:	i mean, i think, i mean, it's, it, it is a terrible problem.
A:	right.
M:	so,
A:	well,  how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?
M:	i think it should be based on the number of people that were killed.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, i think that's a, i donno, i'm not sure that's, that's really the right way to do it. i, i, uh i think, i would agree with you that there should be some way of checking for, uh, uh, you, you can't just say, you've, you're, you have a certain age that you're going to be drug tested and then you can say, well i'm sure you have drug use.
A:	huh.
M:	you know, and i think, i think that, that's, that would be unfair to the jury because they have to decide whether or not they want to hear the facts.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but i think, i don't know, i, i'm not sure that it's that important. i think they should have more say.
A:	yeah.
M:	but i don't think it's a, a necessity.
A:	right.
M:	so i don't, i donno, i, i think, i'm not, i mean, i just think it's not going to be, it's going to have to be unanimous.
A:	yeah. that's true.
M:	but, uh.
A:	huh.
M:	but it's not, you can't do that.
A:	oh, out of as opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
M:	yeah. right.
A:	uh-huh. well, we're,  who, who
M:	we're  we're in the process of, of building a, a system.
A:	do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work?
M:	uh, they, they're, they go through the process of selection.
A:	oh, okay, your talking about
M:	i'm talking about the, the insurance companies, the ones that are, that are paying out huge amounts of money to these people.
A:	sure.
M:	and they, and they have to pay for it themselves.
A:	okay. well,
M:	so, uh, that's the first thing they look for is if you're going to do it that way.
A:	but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
M:	right.
A:	that, for, oh, uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that. that's a very good example.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so, i mean, they have no way of knowing if the person is guilty or innocent.
A:	right. that will,
M:	and that will make it even more difficult for them.
A:	huh.
M:	and, uh, i, i think it's, it's going to be a big problem. uh, the way our tax laws are structured and, uh you can't just tax people out of the work place, uh.
A:	sure. okay.
M:	!!!%!! translated.
