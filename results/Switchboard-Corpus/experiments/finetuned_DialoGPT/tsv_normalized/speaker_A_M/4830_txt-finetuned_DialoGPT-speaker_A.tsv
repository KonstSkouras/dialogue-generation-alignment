M:	well, that's true.
A:	you know what i mean?
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	i mean, i don t even know what the procedures are.
A:	right.
M:	i mean, it just, you know, it was just so out of the question.
A:	that's it.
M:	so i think that we have to do something about, uh, the length of the prison sentence.
A:	well, i, i feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. i, i really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, i mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. if they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. there's, uh, no question
M:	uh-huh.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. you know, all these things. i mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
M:	right, well, they could have, uh  taken the money away from the criminal and let them go free and let the judge do it. uh,
A:	and it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
M:	yeah.
A:	i, i think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
M:	yeah.
A:	i, i'm serious. and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. with plea bargaining.
M:	yeah.
A:	you know, if someone is
M:	you mean if they are not guilty,
A:	well.
M:	if you're, you know, you're a lawyer and you're going to say well i, i can't do this, i have to go back and prove that i can, you can't, because i can make a hundred dollars, you name sounds a lot better than me.
A:	well, i know. that's what i'm saying. but i think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. i mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, i don't know how it works exactly but  you know, they get lesser sentences
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and i understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but, i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
M:	that's true.
A:	you know what i'm saying? that we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
M:	no, huh-uh.
A:	and, uh i, i think they should.
M:	i do too.
A:	i, and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. like drunk drivers that kill people and, uh, you know, all
M:	right, and it's not fair.
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. i, i just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	i think that's the best way to go because then you can, you can get a, a judge to actually decide.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	she served time in a mental hospital and was, uh...
A:	oh, really.
M:	and he's been back since then, and i've heard that they're really going to, uh, beef up his appeal process.
A:	it, uh, yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	i know that, that uh-huh. and, i don't know. uh, what would you do to change it? to make it better?
M:	well, i, i think there is, there is some things that need to be changed. uh  like, uh.
A:	oh, yeah. i, i, i don't agree with that at all.
M:	uh, you know.
A:	imagine the guilt that person would have. i mean  burned out.
M:	yeah.
A:	there's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
M:	yeah. that's right.
A:	if you had to do something like that, day after day.
M:	right.
A:	no. not really.
M:	you know, you can't be sued for anything.
A:	well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	i mean, supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you.
M:	right.
A:	in other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but i think, i think it's important that we also examine the legal system and also the criminal side of it, to see how we can improve it.
A:	yeah.
M:	and they could be sitting at the other end of the spectrum and saying, well, i don't want to hear about this, you know.
A:	well, i, i,
