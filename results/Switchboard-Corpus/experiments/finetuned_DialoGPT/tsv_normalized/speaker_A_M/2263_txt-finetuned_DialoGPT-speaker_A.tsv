A:	oh, really? oh. you really rough it then.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. do you do that very often?
M:	yeah, uh-hope not, not very often.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, it's a lot of fun.
A:	uh-huh. you'd have a lot of hills in that, down in that area.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	we've got, we've got a lot, uh, we have a golf tournament this weekend.
A:	that would be really great.
M:	and, uh, we were there a couple of weeks ago and, uh it was really hilly, but, uh.
A:	pardon?
M:	you know, uh, twenty-twos, uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. that sounds like it'd be fun. did you go alone or with a group or,
M:	no, i, i did it by myself.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, he, he went with me and my brother, and, uh we had a good time.
A:	uh-huh. oh, that's great. long as it's not raining.
M:	yeah, that sounds good.
A:	uh-huh. really, oh, that would be,
M:	but, uh, no, i have, i don't have any, any camping experience whatsoever. i have my own, uh
A:	huh-uh. well, i'm in pennsylvania.
M:	oh, really?
A:	yes
M:	oh, okay.
A:	are you in texas, now?
M:	yeah, i am.
A:	oh. okay.
M:	yeah, so that's, that's pretty good.
A:	most everybody i've been talking to is from texas, but, uh, we're up here in western, northwestern part of pennsylvania.
M:	okay.
A:	uh-huh. well you kind of know what it's like, then. yeah.
M:	it's, uh.
A:	but, we've, uh, we've done, uh, many types of camping. we've, we've done tent camping, and we had access to a motor home which is really super great, if you don't want to rough it too much.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and they have a water aerobics class that you can take kids up to thedo.
A:	right. just get you away from the everyday things that are going on. we, when the children were smaller we used to go to, uh, delaware along the ocean most every year. and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and, uh, we really enjoyed that.
M:	uh, uh-hope.
A:	huh?
M:	i'm losing my train of thought here.
A:	oh, maybe my, dropping my phone. is that better?
M:	yeah.
A:	oh. but,
M:	!!! remindme!! auto attacks!! autocorrect!!
A:	yeah. well, we used to, we don't as much anymore, but, uh, we used to. we kind of slowed down a little bit. but, uh, i think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining. if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping then it can be kind of bad.
M:	yeah, we've had a dry season, too.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then you can't get them back.
A:	i don't think i would like that. what kind?
M:	well, it was, it's, it really was, i mean, i really thought it was a really good movie.
A:	oh. those aren't too pleasant.
M:	but, uh, some of the things i like to do are, uh like to play trombone in the summertime
A:	yeah. we have some of them around here. you probably have more there, though, i would imagine.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh.
M:	they had a lot of people from all sorts of different backgrounds, you know, from, uh, different backgrounds.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they had to use all their, all their tents and everything.
A:	uh-huh. but you still backpacked and camped out.
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it was, it was a lot of fun.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	yeah. i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing.
M:	right. yeah.
A:	yeah. yeah, i would think, i would think a cave would be, could have problems like that, too.
M:	well, i think, uh, i've, i was thinking about that, and i, i,
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh, is your brother younger than you or,
M:	uh, he's, he, he'll be twenty-two next month.
A:	uh-huh, uh-huh, well, that's great, that'd be a lot of fun. you have a lot good experiences from that. yeah.
M:	so.
A:	did you really? what, black ones?
M:	!!!!!!action!!%!! remind me!! animation!! animated!!atic!! this is a program that i've been working on at work.
A:	yeah. that would be exciting.
M:	i like to see those.
A:	yeah, they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	they're on the increase in this area.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i haven't, i haven't noticed it up here.
A:	the black bear.
M:	yeah, i've seen those before, but i don't remember what they look like.
A:	oh, yeah.
M:	it's, it's not that big.
A:	yeah, the population's been really up. they've, uh, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them, because they were, uh, increasing so much.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	yeah. but, uh, we, we really like camping. i, i must say that, uh, we we really have a lot of fun, a lot of memories in that from camping and, uh.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etwork!! you know!!you!!have you done much camping?
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	it's, it, it is, it really is.
A:	it's just, so, it's a lot of work, too
M:	yeah, it is.
A:	it's, uh, you know, getting ready and taking care of everything. but it's, um, it's really refreshing. so,
M:	yeah, i think that's what i'm going to do, too.
A:	i think so well, it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again, and do a little more of it.
M:	okay.
