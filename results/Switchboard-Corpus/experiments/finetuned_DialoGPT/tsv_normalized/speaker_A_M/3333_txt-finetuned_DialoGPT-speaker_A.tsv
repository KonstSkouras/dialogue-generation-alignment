M:	oh.
A:	oh, so this is the first time i've even done it.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i wonder how long it's going to be on for.
M:	it's only about, uh, two and a half weeks.
A:	oh, no, i mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something, do you know?
M:	yeah, yeah, i think so.
A:	yeah, okay, well back to crime, i guess we're supposed to talk about that. they say what aspect are you worried about, well, i think at this point, i for one am worried about every aspect
M:	yeah.
A:	i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.
M:	oh.
A:	uh-huh, golly i know.
M:	and, uh.
A:	have they done that in garland?
M:	uh, i don't know. i know that there's been a couple of people that have, uh, had their cars stolen, and i, i'm not really sure what the circumstances surrounding that.
A:	now, um,
M:	i'm not either.
A:	right.
M:	and they had, uh, they had a lot of, uh they had some property there, and they, uh the parents were very upset about that.
A:	well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	and the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school, so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.
M:	huh.
A:	so. yeah, it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school and you wonder if he's going to get shot. i mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	what next?
M:	what, what next.
A:	right, and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this, they just can't do it.
M:	no, it seems like, it, it really does, and you know there's, there's just, i, i just don't know, i don't, i mean there's so much, you can't just trust the people anymore, you have to trust the system, and the government to, to put these people in jail, you don't want them in jail either, you got to, you've got to trust them to do this, and to do that, and i think it's really important that we do that.
A:	i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh. right and,
M:	because, um  it's just, you can't make it.
A:	i think so, and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.
M:	uh, i, i agree with you. i think it's a matter of, uh
A:	these, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all
M:	yeah.
A:	i think i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.
M:	yeah.
A:	i think it was just rare, i really do.
M:	yeah.
A:	my mother, well, she's like seventy-four now. she, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in california, and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her, and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both, and, uh,
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	no, i'm the one,
M:	well, that's the, that was the other one that i was thinking of was, uh.
A:	yeah, that must have been at least fifty years ago or more, but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks
M:	oh, i know.
A:	but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas
M:	well, you're right. i'm not in dallas.
A:	it's just, you know, another killing.
M:	oh yeah, you just read about that just a few days ago, too.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh
A:	um. uh-huh. uh-huh. right, lots of their picture and life story and everything.
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but they were just in a, in a day care center.
A:	right.
M:	and, uh, he, he went to a, uh a mental hospital and, uh they, they put him in a, a,
A:	right. i know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,
M:	yeah.
A:	so, uh, that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in arlington, when was it, i think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	yeah, i think it was on a hard copy, she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,
M:	uh.
A:	remember that?
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	right, right, that's, uh,
M:	yeah, i've seen that, that was really cute.
A:	my daughter graduated with her from arlington high school.
M:	oh, my.
A:	yeah, can you believe it, that's just, uh,
M:	i mean, it's, it was a, it is a good program. i mean, you know, they're, they've got, they have a, a great curriculum. they've got a lot of information in it.
A:	taco bueno, right, uh-huh.
M:	and she, uh.
A:	uh-huh. right.
M:	and, and she was in the bathroom with the door open, you know, and he just jumped up and started jumping up and down on her, on her waist, you could see it.
A:	yeah, uh, uh, isn't that weird?
M:	yeah.
A:	i know, and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime. you know, he was just begging her on the phone, that's not doing anything.
M:	right.
A:	and there are times i think, gee, i should give my kids
