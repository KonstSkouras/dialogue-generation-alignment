M:	oh.
A:	so i mean i'm used i'm used to having cats around i like them.
M:	uh yeah.
A:	oh see i'm not uh i'm not a dog person at all
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah probably i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid in fact
M:	yeah.
A:	i may still be um we
M:	well i i have a dog and i you know we went out and bought him and he was part springer spaniel part cocker spaniel.
A:	that  um i wonder sometimes
M:	well i don't know i i have a friend who has a dog and uh he's always had dogs
A:	um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and um uh he has a dog and everything we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything and uh i felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until sunday it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog. it was like oh that could be it.
M:	oh no.
A:	yeah. well dogs are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot you know you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing.
M:	no it's it really isn't.
A:	um and um um you know it's it's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know all cats are indoor cats
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so you know they're not you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah it's you know it's a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans . they didn't
M:	no i i'm not sure if i would consider that a hobby.
A:	well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible. but now they have like this you get these liners that is garbage bags you know
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and you and you you know the
M:	and the and the people and it's just it you don't even know what it is you just you have to wonder if it's some sort of uh some sort uh-hive uh uh uh you know for for uh
A:	yeah the cats do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and that's it
M:	i've got a i've got two cats now and they're both about the same age.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and we had a a cat um who was uh about eight years old and she would sleep in the back of the house with us
A:	same idea
M:	uh and it was a lot of fun but i was also trying to figure out you know how to get rid of the the uh sticky buns and and the and all the little things that that we have to peel for the to open the can.
A:	everyday?
M:	and it was it was a very dirty pan
A:	oh okay i see.
M:	and so i guess i i think that's the only thing i can really complain about about is uh the service charge. i don't know if it's just a part of it but uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and it would have killed the cat but it was so worth it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so she's she has a real fear about cucumbers cucumbers because she says that they're just too hard she doesn't want to eat them.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and so she has put in a lot of work and and he's been an excellent dog.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so
A:	so you don't have anything right now?
M:	no not right now.
A:	oh except the kid huh that's 
M:	yeah so.
A:	uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um yeah we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out
M:	oh.
A:	and um uh it's not a big deal really i mean they're they're happier when we're around but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog.
M:	yeah.
A:	well  that's that's um pampering the the petals
M:	uh yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and then you you had to go out and mow the grass
A:	but they're not that much fun you know you can't take them for a walk you can't you know they they don't they can't fetch you know
M:	yeah.
A:	they they can't do anything so i've never i think we had fish when i was a kid but i don't
M:	oh i've heard of them.
A:	oh.
M:	and it was like it was about eleven or twelve feet long and he jumped out and jumped right into it.
A:	oh.
M:	and it was a it was it it looked like it was the same color as the one that my mother made.
A:	oh.
M:	but um.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so we just took our dog in and he was just it was just too much.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and we had to get rid of all of the barns that were there and the barn was empty and we couldn't get out there and we were trying to get out the the uh the drag net out and we tried to get back out and the and then we couldn tinker with that and we ended up having to get all the drag out of the dragnet and that was that was a that's a part of the problem you know we had all the barn space in the house but we had no room for dragnet.
A:	no it's like i just i don't know i i just never understood why what the attraction i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish. it's not as much fun.
M:	well they they have to be they just have to get used to each other i guess.
A:	an eel?
M:	an elk.
A:	oh now we really get sick
M:	yeah but they're not too bad.
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh we've had some pretty nice weather down there.
A:	like i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha and uh you know used to drop mice in
M:	uh-huh.
A:	this is not these aren't cats you know
M:	oh really.
A:	this is gross.
M:	i know.
A:	yep.
M:	i don't know.
A:	yeah well
M:	but uh i don't know i think uh.
A:	yeah well a cat will do the same trick
M:	yeah.
A:	i had a friend in i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	um i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department.
M:	oh really.
A:	whoops
M:	so i don know but i guess i i my pet peeve with magazines is i find them to be very formula oriented and i think that's one of the reasons that they've gone downhill the last few years but they're they're still around
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i said well you can't do that i'm sorry.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but um.
A:	uh-huh. oh yeah i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so .
M:	well i i think i'm not sure how much of that is uh you you have to do with the the social changes that have occurred uh.
A:	yeah rats are not my favorite animals in the world but i could see getting one from birth and everything.
M:	well we we have a dog now and we uh we found her about a year ago and uh we took her home and she had picked up a ham and it was the strangest thing she was a hamster.
A:	yeah.
M:	and
A:	yeah i i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing.
M:	well they
A:	i just again it gets into vivant much fun you know what i guess they can be. i
M:	i know.
A:	okay.
M:	and um.
A:	right.
M:	but it's very much possible to have one without a lot of of these you don't have to be a certain income holder to have pets.
A:	oh people
M:	yeah people have pets now.
A:	i don't oh plus i mean the pooper scooper one new york so you know .
M:	yeah well that's that that is a good point. i i'm not sure how how the new york system fits into it but i know that the the uh the new jersey school system uh
A:	yeah uh  i was living in northern jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it
M:	yeah.
