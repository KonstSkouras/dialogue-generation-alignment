M:	and i think you know it's a shame too because i think that uh the way the the uh government is run and it's not working and i think it's corrupt and it uh it's just not working.
A:	there's uh maybe some short-term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition.
M:	uh-uh. right.
A:	that
M:	it's it's a it was a big thing when uh the oil companies were talking about uh you know putting the the barrel age in metric you know.
A:	uh state of minnesota.
M:	minnesota okay.
A:	so there's the potential that perhaps you know the u s budget might want to take a look at it's uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages. i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it
M:	uh.
A:	so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term.
M:	right.
A:	and the only other avenue that i can think of is uh looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. as for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars.
M:	uh right.
A:	and it was just i mean you can go to k-mart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats
M:	right right.
A:	so. so it gives you idea that
M:	well i i guess we're going to talk about uh what do you think about the school system in the united states?
A:	sure sure. so
M:	i mean
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but um.
A:	than we think. sure. sure.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh. it sure is. the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences. they were using it as eating out uh when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that.
M:	right. right.
A:	and it's a real big crunch uh
M:	right right.
A:	of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are uh spending money that does not belong to them. so
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think they're right that uh that that a lot of times they do throw in the towel the wrong way.
A:	sure.
M:	um i guess i'm a little bit too uh-hated about the uh the the um i i don't know i don't really know what the solution to that is.
A:	uh-huh. exactly. and i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs
M:	yeah.
A:	but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use. i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's you know uh they didn't want to do it anymore.
M:	right.
A:	so a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things. so i don't know.
M:	yeah i think they're probably right.
A:	okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening.
M:	well you too.
A:	uh-huh thanks.
M:	bye.
A:	bye now.
