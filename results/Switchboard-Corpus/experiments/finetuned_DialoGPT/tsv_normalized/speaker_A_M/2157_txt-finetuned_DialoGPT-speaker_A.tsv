M:	oh really?
A:	uh-huh.
M:	they had a pretty good year. uh they've they're they were a lot better team when meacocca was playing.
A:	yeah they're going to get better. i mean you know.
M:	they're not going to be able to last year. they're not sure what's going to happen.
A:	yeah. as long as troy aikman doesn't get hurt again. that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year.
M:	uh-uh. that's right. that was a big one.
A:	so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually.
M:	oh i know who you're talking about. i i like the giants.
A:	okay. i think i did know that i just forgot. okay.
M:	but uh yeah i i really like the giants.
A:	yeah. has herschel walker done much for them?
M:	well he's doing real good yeah.
A:	definitely. well he was a good player. i guess well i don't know he just never i don't know for a while there 
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone. but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team. but i don't know.
M:	yeah.
A:	emmett smith yeah.
M:	yeah that's the other guy that's uh you you know. that's been our guy of the year so far.
A:	he's been doing real good. i'm pretty impressed with him so far.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	did he did he actually play in the pro bowl. i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah i kind of i haven't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i i can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that. but uh
M:	yeah
A:	yeah.
M:	they they had uh they had a a guy that was in there for a while who uh he was a he was an assistant coach at one time for the minnesota minnesota twins.
A:	um i have no idea.
M:	he's uh he's the assistant coach for the new orleans raiders.
A:	no earthly idea.
M:	i've never heard of him.
A:	how did they end up this year? did they did they make it to the play-offs at all?
M:	uh no. they uh they didn't make it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so
A:	kind of like the cowboys huh.
M:	yeah.
A:	except i think the cowboys are on the upswing i don't know about the vikings
M:	yeah.
A:	just hadn't heard much about them lately.
M:	no.
A:	yeah. well the cardinals i don't know. i think the cowboys probably have a a better team. they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt because uh laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all. of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean he didn't get to see much action. but too bad. because now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one's going to have much faith in him any more.
M:	right.
A:	in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback. i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of. but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh aikman's back in practicing doing real real well. um who is it michael irvin
M:	uh i can't think of the guy's name.
A:	he said that uh aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time. so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season. they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in it was his shoulder wasn't it that he had the problems with?
M:	right.
A:	i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on. but anyway they're trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway
M:	yeah i don't i i know i guess i'm a big dallas fan i'm not a big cowboy fan at all.
A:	thirty day notice for what?
M:	day notice for having your car checked out.
A:	oh really.
M:	yeah.
A:	what. oh okay maybe i'll call you back after after the recording is finished. actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes. i can't remember.
M:	yeah okay.
A:	really. i usually have too .
M:	i i i don't know i think i've i do i always i just i'm not real good at keeping track of time.
A:	yeah i've done that once or twice. i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in.
M:	right. right.
A:	yeah. so other than the vikings who do you like?
M:	well i like the packers. i like dallas.
A:	uh oh.
M:	but uh i i'm not a big uh
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh i like to watch the cardinals and i like the giants too but i like philadelphia.
A:	uh-huh. back when they were in saint louis?
M:	yeah i i used to be a big saint louis cardinals fan
A:	since they've been to phoenix they haven't been uh all that impressive i guess. i guess i've always been a cowboy fan. other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to get caught up in it.
M:	yeah. well you've uh you've had some good years.
A:	yeah.
M:	and now uh you know.
A:	yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the cowboys were really big. because my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and you know the hype were just unbelievable. it's just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty-four about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys cowboys cowboys and you know super bowl and all this other stuff. so i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again. they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think. but they're raising prices on their tickets. so they're banking on doing good next season. i think tickets are
M:	well i don i've never bought any merchandise from the cowboys but i always like to shop anyway.
A:	yeah.
M:	i don't know it's just me and my brother and my wife and our daughter and it's it seems like it's really a sad commentary on life uh
A:	thirty or thirty-two for really good tickets. see they they sectioned it out even more. they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price. and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else. and now they're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line. and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones. but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up more or less is what it's going to do.
M:	oh i see.
A:	um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't i didn't really think about that. i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper. but not that i'll ever go. i hadn't been to a cowboys game time last time i went to the cowboys game was during that um n f l strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh dallas and washington redskins game. and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else. so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time. but that wasn't a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess. and before that it's been quite a few years. i've been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it. so maybe this year .
M:	well that's true.
A:	oh.
