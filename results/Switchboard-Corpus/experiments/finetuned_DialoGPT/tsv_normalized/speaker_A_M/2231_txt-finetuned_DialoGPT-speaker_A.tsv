M:	yeah.
A:	yes. yes. not getting paroled let's say in so many years.
M:	right.
A:	i mean if your going to sentence somebody let's say twenty years let them stay twenty years.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	there has that's right.
M:	and i think that that that there needs to be a balance somewhere.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i don't know how that would work. i i don tought about that in the courtroom but i'm not sure how that works.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and then you know they have to go back to work and they have their day care and and that's about it you you can't really do much for them.
A:	uh-huh. that's right. that's honestly right.
M:	yeah it's kind of sad.
A:	uh they sure are just because some innocent person can really
M:	uh.
A:	it seems like really a rough time
M:	yeah.
A:	you know? i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance. you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them
M:	uh-huh.
A:	he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street.
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and i don't think that's right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	it's going well it's not going to be any better you're just going to have to deal with it and that's the way it's always been and and it's just going you have to accept that you can't let it get to that point you you just have to live with it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean that would just leave them in jail for life.
A:	time uh-huh. yes. i was i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know you you've got to go out there and and kill somebody just to get out of it.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. you get it back yeah.
M:	but uh you also get someone like jimmy carter who's like who's twenty-one or twenty-two years old who's who uh who's very old and has done some horrible things and uh you know  you give him up for some reason or other
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh
A:	yeah. but it's i i know.
M:	i i don't think it's possible to do much about you know like uh the crime in the cities. i think i think it would be good to have some kind of you you have to have a police force you got to have people that are together to deal with it.
A:	same thing yes.
M:	and and i don't see  any way of rehabilitation or anything  for these people.
A:	yes. uh-huh.
M:	and i
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they are not the same as the people that are living in the country.
A:	uh a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know?
M:	right.
A:	thank goodness. but still it could.
M:	well i don't know i i'm sure it will.
A:	yes. uh-huh.
M:	and they're going to have to do it again.
A:	and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is. you know i i haven't kept up you know anything like that.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but i don't think it was ever really taken seriously.
A:	uh. uh-huh.
M:	but i don't i'm not sure what the punishment would be for those people.
A:	yes. but still it came up though didn't it
M:	i think it was a case of opportunity.
A:	i mean you know
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they didn't they didn tershape the sentence.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	so he was sentenced to death and then uh he was allowed to go back and uh and serve his time in the paroled.
A:	yes. the victim is really seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it
M:	yes it does.
A:	in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and he's been found guilty of it.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's it's a very complicated case and the jury may not be able to recommend you might say uh sentencing or or a mistrial you're right they may not even be able to recommend a jury.
A:	or you know plead insanity.
M:	yeah yeah.
A:	oh yes
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but i don't know maybe they should have been more clear.
A:	yes. i it just just doesn't make sense
M:	no.
A:	i
M:	and and it's not safe at all.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh you know i i can go out at like eleven thirty in the morning and just be by myself.
