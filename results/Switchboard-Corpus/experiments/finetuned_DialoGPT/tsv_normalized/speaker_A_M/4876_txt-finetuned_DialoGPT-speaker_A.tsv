M:	huh.
A:	huh.
M:	i mean, we had one child that i was going to school with that i had never even met before, and, and he was the best, uh child care provider i've ever had in my life.
A:	huh.
M:	but, uh
A:	oh, well that's interesting.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh, my god.
M:	!!!%!! remind me!!ets!!;!! fun!!
A:	well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh, well, yeah
M:	so, uh,
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i, i felt very strong about it. but, uh.
A:	well, not, not all of us. you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. i'm an engineer.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	and,
M:	i think, i think they're, they're a lot better than t i.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh we had, uh a, a couple of dorms that were like, uh one was a biology building, one was, uh the biology building and one was the nursing building and then the science building,
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh and then, of course, you know, there's also the fact that, uh.
A:	five hundred dollars a week.  for two kids.
M:	and they, they didn't learn anything.
A:	that's incredible.
M:	but, uh, you know, we had, uh  a friend of ours who was teaching for a while and, uh she was paid, well, actually i think she was twice a week
A:	oh, oh.
M:	so, yeah, we, we were real lucky because, um, my husband and i both work and, um.
A:	well.
M:	so i'm not sure what i would do without them.
A:	yeah.
M:	and,
A:	you know, they could, somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know, that's a good starting wage
M:	yeah, i know.
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
M:	right.
A:	huh.
M:	and i think that's probably a big problem.
A:	i mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. but mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven so you know, that,
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	i guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
M:	yeah, it's five dollars.
A:	oh my.
M:	and they just, you know.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	oh, yeah.
