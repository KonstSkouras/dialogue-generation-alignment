A:	and we have about ten acres, and she tries to mow about half of it
M:	!!!% well, that's a lot of space.
A:	well, yeah, it keeps, uh, well, it's doing real well, because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed
M:	uh,
A:	i mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places
M:	uh.
A:	and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, and, you know, of course we water a little bit, that's just too much to water all at once, but but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in, we've reclaimed a lot of it.
M:	oh, i see.
A:	yeah, but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers. we have one little flower garden that we, that we work with.
M:	uh, uh-homing.
A:	the rest of it is just like wild flowers
M:	uh.
A:	and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.
M:	oh.
A:	they're about, oh, i guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand
M:	uh, well, that's true.
A:	and course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and indian paintbrush.
M:	oh, that sounds wonderful.
A:	yeah. well, my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing.
M:	well, i don't know.
A:	uh, she enjoys mowing. i can't believe it.
M:	well, that's neat.
A:	i mean, i hate it
M:	yeah.
A:	right.
M:	so we have a lot to do, and so we're just kind of, you, you're not, you don't feel like you're really contributing much, but you're at least something.
A:	we don't even have any concrete or asphalt.
M:	no, you can't even get asphalt from the road.
A:	uh-huh. yeah but, you know, we do everything together.
M:	right. yeah, i've, i used to think that, um.
A:	this, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, actually this fall, i was talking about, two weeks ago we got a thousand pine trees from the, you know, soil and conservation people
M:	uh, uh-hous.
A:	and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting
M:	uh, are you involved with the, uh the national bureau of standards?
A:	and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line
M:	uh-hum.
A:	and i, uh, i think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break because i tell you, in the winter time when that, when that wind comes out of the north, it just cuts right through you like you're not even there.
M:	yeah.
A:	so.
M:	well, that's good.
A:	on the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums, and we have morning glory
M:	uh.
A:	and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers, and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water
M:	uh.
A:	and we get hummingbirds come in the spring, you know, all summer long.
M:	oh, that sounds,
A:	and, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.
M:	uh.
A:	well, yeah, they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
M:	yeah.
A:	and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.
M:	yeah.
A:	and we got a few, you know, we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, well, we got asparagus, and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato and some blackberries and strawberries.
M:	oh.
A:	man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.
M:	oh, well that's nice.
A:	we just got our last tomatoes.
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah.
M:	and i love, i, i like it's like a little more drama
A:	well, these are accidental tomatos.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes, of course you're going to lose some that way
M:	oh, really.
A:	and the seeds go right through them.
M:	oh.
A:	and wherever they pooped,
