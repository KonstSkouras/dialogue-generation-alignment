A:	and they're just really close here. and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.
M:	oh.
A:	and, uh, and i, that's hard to be a caretaker i really believe. it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.
M:	uh, yeah, i think so too.
A:	uh, she has alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything.
M:	yeah.
A:	and so she asks the same questions over and over again. which is not you know, unrealistic.
M:	yeah.
A:	um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!
A:	uh, i, uh, some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.
M:	oh.
A:	she's ninety-two.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	oh, i think that's wonderful.
M:	and they're very active and very active in the church and, uh you know, they have, uh a lot of activities going on. they have a lot going on in the neighborhood and, you know they have a mother's day out and things like that, and,
A:	well, uh-huh.
M:	i mean, you know, they're, they, they have to be careful about what they do.
A:	yeah. i was just going to say.
M:	and they're so spread out and so they can't be cared for.
A:	yeah. um,
M:	and i think they're all, i think, well most of them are women, i mean, most of the ones that are in there now are women.
A:	yes.
M:	but, uh.
A:	uh, i think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves. um,
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	yeah, yeah
M:	i mean, you know, he's, you can't take your own stuff and put it in this other room and it won't do you any good.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	nursing homes.
M:	yes, and, uh.
A:	visit.
M:	i know.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	um, but i have, you know, i've done some of the, uh, planning around here.
A:	they don't go and see them. that's right.
M:	but, uh, i, i think that's one of the reasons that nursing homes are so expensive.
A:	that's right.
M:	so.
A:	you know, um, i, i think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i have to say that.
M:	yeah, i agree with you. i think they're really a, a good thing.
A:	but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.
M:	uh, i agree with you.
A:	um,
M:	um.
A:	right, right.
M:	i, i think that's a really important point. i think, uh, in the, in our society, um, we've, we're really trying to, uh
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	i hope so.
M:	yeah, i'm, i know, i've been, i was raised in one and i know it, you know, the, the horror stories you hear about people going to the nursing home and the people actually dying there,
A:	you know, it's, i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.
M:	uh-uh. uh-hue.
A:	and then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, i'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't, uh, it's a very, very hard decision i think.
M:	yeah, i agree.
A:	uh-huh. i think that's right,
M:	but, uh.
A:	and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.
M:	yeah, i agree.
A:	now i know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.
M:	uh-uh.
A:	and that might be a partial solution, or something.
M:	well, i think that's probably the only way that we're going to get to that. i think it's going to have to be a continuing problem.
A:	but, um, i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever,
M:	uh,
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and i'm not, i'm, i think we're probably going to be talking about, uh, going into the nursing home.
A:	well, i, i think we kind of are along the same lines.
M:	i do too.
A:	good to hear from you.
M:	okay.
A:	have a lovely day.
M:	you too.
