A:	oh okay.
M:	!!!%!!!!!;!!eting!! remind me.
A:	yes.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh
A:	um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in-depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read newsweek can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v but uh um i found out that also on on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to. um i found out though that or i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative. there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news. and it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.
M:	uh-huh.

A:	uh-huh. i've heard an interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes an awful lot of money and commitment and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing
M:	uh yeah that's true. that's true that that is true. but uh.
A:	and go after you know it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so. i don't know i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media
M:	yeah.
A:	and we have to pay that price but uh i don't know i don't know. it's interesting and i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the
M:	uh i agree with you.
A:	exactly. we saw yes you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that. so.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh yes.
M:	and and and the earthquake was it was quite an experience for uh you know the unprepared for the earthquake.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know they just kind of stood there and still said you're right we're going to put some money in it you you can get in there and you'll get out and it's going to be great you don't have to worry about it.
