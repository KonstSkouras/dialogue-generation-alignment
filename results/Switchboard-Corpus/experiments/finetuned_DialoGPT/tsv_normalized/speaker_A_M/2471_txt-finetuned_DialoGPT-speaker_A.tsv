M:	yeah.
A:	i mean not not to this large scale as iraq but that
M:	uh.
A:	whenever we give arms to people as we did and as we sold arms to pardon me to iraq when we wanted them to fight iran and then uh and then it turn around and
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh. and i know when i spent the time that i've studied in mexico uh spanish was one of my majors in college that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america
M:	oh really.
A:	about uh like you say using them our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them
M:	right.
A:	and that we weren't normally very interested in them and they have in other in most latin american countries they there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they don't have uh i mean there's just very few really modern cities.
M:	right right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	the the drug lords and the big market up there and that's that that i think is probably the most uh-havings in latin america.
A:	well that's right because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming
M:	uh
A:	and they don't look at it so much as you know
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh. that's right.
M:	you know we we don't we pay an annual fee for it and and it's not it's really not too bad. i mean i i think it's a pretty good idea but i don't think it should be mandatory.
A:	and i think it's really very sad that north of the border you know the united states and canada is so different from the from south america and central america.
M:	oh yeah.
A:	there's really a disparity between the uh what a i would call civilization of the countries you know.
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh it's not it's it is not just a problem with america it it has to do with uh the the there's a lot of resentment i mean the mexican people are are they're a lot more uh...
A:	yes it's really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between jerusalem and uh israel and the middle east arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems right in our own back door.
M:	uh yeah.
A:	um.
M:	and uh.
A:	so i guess we've kind of neglected latin america.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	recently
M:	right.
A:	yeah fairly recently. well that's really sad. i hadn't thought about that in a long time.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	well i guess then i will go but i
M:	well i i don't know it's just i it seems like i'm getting older and and i'm not sure if i'm going to to stay as old as i want to be.
A:	made me stop and think a minute about not worrying so much about the middle east crisis.
M:	yeah.
A:	i know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
M:	right.
A:	well thank you you have a good day.
M:	you too.
A:	bye-bye.
M:	okay i guess we're ready to begin.
