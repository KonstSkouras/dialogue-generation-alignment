M:	well  you know it's  it's getting to be a necessity.
A:	seems like i just bought it.
M:	did you?
A:	it's an eighty-nine and i bought it uh in uh eighty-eight so yeah.
M:	yeah well i i've had uh
A:	i know i really will do that the next time i buy it too.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but i'm not sure that it was practical for us.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but we wanted something that was light you know
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's a uh three fifty in the morning hours and it's got uh uh eight thousand miles on it.
A:	oh that's wonderful.
M:	and uh it's really it it handles just wonderfully.
A:	uh-huh. oh okay.
M:	i i think uh i've been around a lot of people that have uh
A:	uh-huh. huh.
M:	so
A:	sure.
M:	but uh.
A:	right.
M:	or i would stay in the station wagon
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	but do you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities?
M:	i i don't know. i donno i think it's probably i mean i i've had i had a a couple of cars and uh i think one of them was a ninety-one ford taurus.
A:	is that how you i have never
M:	uh-uh. i never really thought about it that way. i mean i i would i probably would buy a new car every two years.
A:	its
M:	and the uh
A:	isn't that a shame.
M:	i don't know. i i don't i just don't think there's a quality difference between the two.
A:	my word isn't that sorry. that's sorry.
M:	i mean it it just it handled like a truck you couldn't really push it. it was just
A:	my word.
M:	and uh.
A:	oh mercy.
M:	i don't know if you're familiar with that but
A:	you
M:	well my husband had a volvo and i had a honda
A:	huh.
M:	and uh so that's the first car i ever bought new.
A:	huh.
M:	and it was uh it was not a very good one at all.
A:	huh. uh-huh.
M:	but uh it's a hard question really. i mean i i don't know i guess i it just seems like there's so many cars that i think are really going to go out of style.
A:	sure.
M:	it was not uh i i don't know i guess it's because it was a big uh large company i mean you didn't see a lot of uh you know you couldn't see too many people that worked for a big company.
A:	no thanks. that's right.
M:	so i i'm not really sure what the solution to that is.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	i just i i felt like uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think one of them was a seventy-six buick and the other one was a eighty-seven.
A:	wow.
M:	and uh there was no
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and so we had to we had a a we bought a uh a used used uh c r x. it was a it was a seventy-seven.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but it was a much better car than what we got.
A:	who makes that car?
M:	uh it's a it was a demo. it was demo'd at a ford dealership.
A:	i mean but where are they where are they what what is their location is it uh asian or is it european or who
M:	um it's it it was built by the same people who built the toyota camry.
A:	oh it is japanese.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	okay
M:	yeah and i i think i
A:	i didn't know.
M:	yeah they had a uh they they put out a a paper release on uh on on you know recycling of plastic uh magazines.
A:	uh-huh. okay
M:	but uh
A:	yeah i guess so that's true. yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	if if if i had the car i wanted.
M:	uh-uh.
A:	gee.
M:	why not just pay the car insurance and and uh that would be the easy way.
A:	probably um uh let's see i like the looks of the lincoln town car
M:	yeah.
A:	but i i don't know the performance of it. that's a ford product
M:	yeah.
A:	and you know i would get hung up by my boot straps if i if i ever mentioned the ford product in my family.
M:	right.
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	and uh you would think that they would make quality products.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	can i put you on hold for one minute?
M:	sure.
A:	thank you. well that was one minute. they hung up.
M:	oh okay.
A:	um well the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. um and the luxuries of a large car.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze. which is probably closest to gold that you can get
M:	uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	uh i've had a lot of luck with ours. we've had uh a couple of ours fail. one of them was a little light uh uh uh a little dented piece of glass and the other one was a piece of tin uh.
A:	right well practical yes that's uh-huh. right and it's cooler i believe too when you're driving in
