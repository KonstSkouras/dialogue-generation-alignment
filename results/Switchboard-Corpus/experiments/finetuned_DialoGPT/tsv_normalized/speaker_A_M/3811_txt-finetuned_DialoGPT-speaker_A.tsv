M:	oh, well, that's good.
A:	so, we're just starting into hunting for child care.
M:	yeah.
A:	right now, both of us are students.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh, uh, university of southern mississippi.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	uh, she's,
M:	she's, she was a, a, uh, a sophomore at u t at the university of texas at dallas.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh, she, she got, she was from a poor immigrant family and, uh
A:	uh, probably. uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh, five days a week more than likely. uh, depending on how my class schedule runs
M:	uh-huh.
A:	because my wife will be doing her internship that semester.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	it will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.
M:	oh, that's great.
A:	so depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point. right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him. uh, i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class. you know, once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us be home.
M:	right.
A:	so for about twenty twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in.
M:	oh, my goodness.
A:	uh-huh
M:	and, uh
A:	yeah.
M:	and whether it was going to cost us money or whether it would be better for us to have, you know, our own, you would have to be willing to sacrifice to have someone guide us.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	we could have had her there to have her dressed, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and they live in a town called david, which is on the outskirts of london. and they're, they're very happy. they have, uh a very elderly population.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  it's, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh, that makes a big difference.
M:	yeah, i think so.
A:	yes.
M:	it's, it's, uh, it has a lot of things to offer, uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and,
A:	there's a lot of child care available, but invariably there's waiting lists.
M:	yeah, that's true.
A:	and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh uh, department of, uh, uh, their home ec department
M:	uh.
A:	uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, american family counseling and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus. but, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.
M:	oh, really?
A:	so,
M:	and i think that's one of the things that's really important to us is to, uh to make sure that, uh...
A:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, it, it seems like, uh you know, the longer you wait the easier it is to get somebody, you know.
A:	yeah.
M:	and i think, you're right, there's a lot of things that you could do, like, you, you could go and, and, uh you know walk into a room and, you can't do anything.
A:	yeah. yeah,
M:	and, uh.
A:	a cottage industry's the best way to do it really, because if you over,
M:	yeah, yeah.
A:	uh-huh. yeah. yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that we're really going to have to, uh
A:	yes. and it's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do.
M:	i know, i, i don't know if it's, uh.
