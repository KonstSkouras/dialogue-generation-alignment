M:	uh-huh. right.
A:	bit. tell me how yours works. well at the i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now.
M:	oh okay.
A:	my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina.
M:	oh.
A:	and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget
M:	uh.
A:	and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic.
M:	!!!%!!;!!!!! remind me.
A:	and uh so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
M:	well i know that my husband's been working and and doing other things with his life and uh he's had to take care of his own business.
A:	so you see
M:	and we're looking forward to just traveling and having fun and and having the time to do it too.
A:	well we actually planned for about one year.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh that god because *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
M:	yeah.
A:	and uh what we did was just uh decide how we had been spending our money before
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted  where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down
M:	yeah.
A:	and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would.
M:	yeah.
A:	but
M:	i think i think that's really important
A:	oh just our own design.
M:	oh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh it it was it's really neat.
A:	and the so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
M:	uh
A:	we spent too much money  until our children went to college so. so tell me about
M:	well i i have a sister who's a a uh a an english major who's in uh
A:	do you all uh have a budget?
M:	well i i'm uh  i'm a graduate student.
A:	wonderful. yes.
M:	and uh.
A:	three and a two year old.
M:	and uh-huh.
A:	bang *one utt?? bang.
M:	that's right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and um we've been trying um. we've tried everything you can go to any store and you can take your clothes out of your own clothes and they're just like oh how nice how neat.
A:	well i think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though you have to do something.
M:	right.
A:	of course not.
M:	but
A:	well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned  but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish  gifts as  we had done before.
M:	yeah.
A:	and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
M:	right.
A:	yes.
M:	and we both know that that's not going to happen.
A:	well i really do i think you have to budget those things though.
M:	i know.
A:	yes.
M:	and you don't want to over do it you want to make it a habit.
A:	exactly although so much per month anyway.
M:	right right.
A:	and uh that really should be in your but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
M:	uh-huh.
A:	oh no no no no.
M:	so we're not allowed to add any deductions and we're even going to try to to add some in the the interest.
A:	you don't want the government to spend your money. you want to be able
M:	no i think that i i agree with you i would much rather have the money to do something like that.
A:	well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and it was for us many years  for many years.
M:	yeah i think it was it was a dream back then too you know.
A:	uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
M:	that's right.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh. well i was just reading an article in uh a north carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities.
M:	oh really.
A:	she was she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done.
M:	huh.
A:	where there's a will  where there's a will there's a way right?
M:	yeah.
