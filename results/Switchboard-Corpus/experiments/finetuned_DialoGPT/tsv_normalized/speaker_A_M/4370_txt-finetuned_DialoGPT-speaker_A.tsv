M:	you can appeal and
A:	um. yeah it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things. i think i have a severe demeanor or something.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh
M:	well i i guess that's the only thing i can really think of is uh
A:	but typically you know uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who is well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice.
M:	right.
A:	right.
M:	and i think that uh  you know you can you can have a jury that that doesn't have to be all the same
A:	so
M:	i mean you you're not going to go out and and get all all the best all of the best players you can get.
A:	so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh
M:	right. that's true.
A:	um.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	um.
M:	i think they should have the option of either guilty or innocent but i don i agree with you that jury selection should be based on how you feel about the case.
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and and they have no right to ask for a jury of their peers.
A:	um.
M:	and i think the judges should be able to recommend sentencing.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	so i don't know. i think i think sometimes it's a little bit of the media's resistance to it.
A:	well i suppose you may be right on that. matter of fact i've heard that  i've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that
M:	yeah.
A:	oh is it? oh i didn't realize that. okay.
M:	so yeah it's it it kind of is a a double whammy. the judge uh-hired the case and then the jury then uh decides who gets the death penalty.
A:	right.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i i don't know i
A:	uh-huh. so you what you're saying is this if there is the second offense then you execute them.
M:	right. i i uh.
A:	um.
M:	the only way that you can rehabilitate a person is by uh persuade them of a behavior that is detrimental to their welfare or uh.
A:	what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets.
M:	yeah i think that uh.
A:	oh really?
M:	yeah.
A:	like what?
M:	well you know i mean i'm i work at a a high school.
