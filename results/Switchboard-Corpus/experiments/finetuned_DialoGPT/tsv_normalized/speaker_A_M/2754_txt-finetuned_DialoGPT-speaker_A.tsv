M:	so i guess i'm kind of uh. i don i uh i donno i guess you'd call it a deterrent but i don tinker with it too much. uh you you would think that that the person who commits the crime would have some kind of remorse for what they did uh
A:	uh i believe in it too
M:	yeah. well i uh
A:	i'm catholic and we're not supposed to but uh i feel that it like you you know on the premeditated murders i feel if you're you know i mean if it's beyond a doubt that you did it you know i would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
M:	uh.
A:	but it's the cases you know like sometimes you you know you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely you know they really didn't do it. well you know you you got you got that point well you know what what if a mistake is made and you put someone you know to death that really didn't do it.
M:	yeah.
A:	there's always that chance i don't know but i would say that you know for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated it would be kind of hard for you know
M:	right.
A:	you know what i'm saying? like
M:	!!!%!! remind me!!;!!!!!that's right!! you know!!you!!yeah!!i!!okay!!what!!?!! line!!did!!and!! fun!!same!!they!!you!!it!!we!!uh!!nice!!is!!hi!!have!!communication!!well!!there!!do!!one!!great!!now!!how!!oh!!.!!!'!!good!!so!!wow!!the!!=!!iveness!!ool!!sv!! auto!!right!!but!!--!!it!!eting!!absolutely!!p!!o!!body!!et!!style!!these!!are!!all!!if!!my!!'!!and!!!!!if!!see!!this!!excuse!! translated!! equality!!big!!holy!! holy!!sure!!just!!thank!!
A:	yeah.
M:	if if they didn't have that overwhelming evidence it might not convict them.
A:	so uh i
M:	i don't know i don't i mean i know that that you know like the uh the the trial by jury in the in in the united states i think i'm not sure how it would work in england but i know in england there's a uh you know there's sort of a sort of you have one person who's appointed to you you can't have more than one person you don't have to be unanimous.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	exactly. uh i'm not sure about pennsylvania whether we have it or not. for some reason i was thinking that we do but it's you know it's not very often. i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that that anyone anyone from pennsylvania had gotten it.
M:	uh well i was i had not heard that.
A:	i don't do you know if virginia has it?
M:	no i i haven't heard of it. i know i was just thinking of uh the uh the the pennsylvania uh state uh-hockey i think it's called.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	i think they just got it out.
A:	i know florida has it.
M:	no.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	but uh.
A:	uh you know
M:	yeah.
A:	yeah. but it's funny that uh i mean like you know like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania. i'm not even sure of that but for some reason i think that you know it was something like that. and it surprised and even florida i know they have it and you don't really hear about it real often how many people
M:	uh-uh.
A:	yeah but you you think that i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed  you know compared to that and to how many people are being sent that doesn't seem like very many.
M:	well i i  i think you can see it in the in the society uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	but you don t have to be convicted of a certain crime and you can't be you can be sentenced to death but you can only be sentenced once.
A:	everyone would appeal. that's true too.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.!!;!!!!!you!!oh!!i!!that!!?!!holy!!
A:	uh-huh uh-huh.
M:	and uh you're right there's no way that you can ever catch those guys
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	and then they they have a waiting period and they have all the information you can find out about your license and everything.
A:	yeah uh-huh.
M:	so you see a lot of a lot more men a a lot uh in the media and and uh.
A:	and then they get out.
M:	and and they and and then you see them in the headlines you never know who they're you don't know who to believe them.
A:	yeah they get out in three years on probation
M:	yeah.
A:	and they do it again you know.
M:	well that's true. that's true that is true.
A:	it's like a slap on the fingers for them.
M:	yeah yeah i mean it's just i don't know. i donno.
A:	i don't i don't i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also. but uh but are are you would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
M:	uh i i would probably say yes. i think there should be some controls against it and uh i and i there should also be some control against it if it if it does happen. uh i also think that there should definitely be some penalties for people who commit certain crimes such as rape uh
A:	yeah.
M:	because i think the way the trial by jury was set up was to make sure that uh that that you you knew that yes you're guilty you can be you've been charged with a crime and you can't you don't have to give up your right to continue living with your crime.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and uh.
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	and and and i don i don think they have the right to do that because you you have to go through you've got to get people that are you can't just you don't have to be the most hardened and uh you know.
A:	i think some of them would rather be in jail
M:	uh yeah.
A:	yeah. they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
M:	uh-uh. well i guess i don't know. i i you know i've i have a hard time thinking that uh you know it's a it's not a problem anymore it it seems like there's been a lot of you can't say that it's it just hasn't been a problem for a very long time.
A:	i don't know uh i was just going to say something i forgot what it was. oh i don't even remember what it was now.
M:	oh okay.
A:	in clarion. well i live in butler but i'm at i'm at college. i'm at clarion university.
M:	oh okay.
A:	yeah
M:	okay.
A:	uh-huh. see yeah okay well see i'm i'm in kind i'm in kind okay uh we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
M:	uh okay
A:	yeah and that would be pushing it. so i mean this is definitely a college town. uh we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any. uh
M:	yeah.
A:	north of pittsburgh pennsylvania.
M:	okay.
A:	oh i've never heard of polk but
M:	okay i'm in garland.
A:	oh i never heard of that.
M:	yeah so
A:	it might have a new name.
M:	i don't know.
A:	yeah yeah.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	we're probably about an hour away from sharon.
M:	okay.
A:	uh-huh. uh so i most of the kids here i you know like you know just from dorm mates and stuff they'll say that they don't believe in it but then after i would say my point of view then they'll say well yeah you know you know.
M:	right.
A:	yeah. you know i think people can be persuaded one way or another. i've never seriously ran into someone i mean like other than my priest you know who definitely says you can't take a you know you can't take anyone's life. uh anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
M:	right.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but you don't hear you you hear stories about people that are you're sure they're guilty.
A:	yeah uh-huh.
M:	and and and i think you you have to have the you need to have some background on it  you know.
A:	yeah
M:	so i i think that that there's there there is a a double standard in in the courts.
A:	uh-huh. uh-huh. yeah. that's something you know but uh whether they plea bargain or not if they're guilty of murder they're guilty of murder you know.
M:	well i mean the guy's you're right he's not going to get off the street for a year or two.
A:	so i don't think that they deserve anything less
M:	no that seems rather shortsighted.
A:	it's just i don't i don't know i just
M:	i think that uh.
A:	uh-huh and that costs money yeah.
M:	and
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh i'm not sure that that we have the right solution to it.
A:	yeah.
M:	but uh.
