A:	and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though.
M:	oh it's just the worst part the the second time i'm not sure how old the dog is but it's uh
A:	she's i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken.
M:	uh uh-hau.
A:	i mean she actually asks to go out.
M:	yeah.
A:	and uh yeah i was amazed. really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality. i don't know i can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog so.
M:	well i think i i don i guess i it's it seems to me that the the uh the it the temperament of this dog is unusual. i mean i've had dogs that that i think are really very aggressive and they bark and they you know they're not really scared of their owner you you're just you don't you can't uh you can just uh put them down and let them run around and
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that that we we've lost some things in our family you know but but i think they they i think it's one of the most enjoyable things to do.
A:	oh really.
M:	she's a miracle baby.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh we have had uh a couple of dogs uh
A:	oh yeah. i had a uh last year i had i had another german shepherd now this one was purebred and uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time
M:	oh.
A:	and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and he actually got over it with seven hundred dollars in vet bills
M:	oh my goodness.
A:	um but he had actually was able to get him over that.
M:	yeah.
A:	and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a cadillac.
M:	oh my.
A:	so i couldn't believe it. that was that was really hard.
M:	well that's that that is that would be tough.
A:	and that was even harder for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
M:	i bet.
A:	and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh. she was really attached to it
M:	oh.
A:	but uh it's unfortunate but now i've got another one so.
M:	yeah.
A:	uh see he it it was just over a year.
M:	oh he waited a year?
A:	uh it was in march of last year. so uh yeah it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year.
M:	oh well i guess they just uh
A:	yeah.
M:	i just i was absolutely
A:	right.
M:	so i just went ahead and got one.
A:	my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way
M:	yeah. that's right.
A:	no how and then uh the he the beagle died in i guess about october and by christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh i or i humane society and got uh got another one a stray.
M:	oh really?
A:	and she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but mom went an
M:	oh no.
A:	yeah.
M:	!!!%!! remind me!!eting!!
A:	yeah it is. well hopefully this one here cocoa will live a full life
M:	uh-huh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah.
M:	and she's just about ready to go.
A:	right.
M:	but uh.
A:	oh.
M:	and uh.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and she's got the old nose and the old ears
A:	yeah.
M:	but she's got the the little eyes and the little nose
A:	that's not too bad. golly the golden retrievers are good dogs too they're kind of like get that permanent smile to them
M:	oh yeah.
A:	they're always always happy. i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy.
M:	oh they they really do.
A:	yeah.
M:	and and she's just a wonderful wonderful temperament
A:	right.
M:	and
A:	this this friend of mine has well it's the same guy that was watching uh my german shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on friday and took he's got a full a pure bred golden retriever and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. and this they just they had a ball romping around
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and you know you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in.
M:	right. that's true.
A:	and uh this golden retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh.
M:	oh yeah i think that's what they call it.
A:	well no actually he had no trouble at all. he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but he jumped in in the the river.
M:	yeah.
A:	well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the the fast moving water
M:	uh-huh.
A:	'cause if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her. and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
M:	oh.
A:	and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon. he loved it.
M:	oh.
A:	cocoa didn't think too much of it though. she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad
M:	oh goodness.
A:	and so but uh she got over it so.
M:	oh that's that that is a a nice dog.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	but she she um got to be a little bit um
A:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	and uh.
A:	yeah i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um it's on oneida lake and i'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. i mean i've got the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her
M:	yeah.
A:	so.
M:	yeah.
A:	oh really.
M:	she she's just been a real trooper and i've been trying to get her out of that situation because it's just so hard to get out of the water.
A:	yeah.
M:	she just kept fighting and i just couldn't deal with it.
A:	no no.
M:	i haven't seen that one yet.
A:	oh really.
M:	yeah. we we got it at a uh a movie place in chicago.
A:	oh okay my my dog last german shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't
M:	uh-huh.
A:	normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it.
M:	right.
A:	yeah.
M:	and he'd just kind of jump on it like he was having a fight or whatever.
A:	right right obstinate obstinate.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
A:	uh-huh.
M:	and i thought well i don t remember this being on t v but i was thinking that was a really good movie.
