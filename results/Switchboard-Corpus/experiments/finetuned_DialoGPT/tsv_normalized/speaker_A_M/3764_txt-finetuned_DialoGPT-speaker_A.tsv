M:	well, i, i work in a, a machine shop.
A:	sure.
M:	but, uh.
A:	you bet.
M:	i'm a graduate of the school and so i know a lot about that kind of thing.
A:	look professional
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah, i understand. i am a, i own my company. i am in the, i am, uh, manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but then when i travel it is a little different situation.
M:	right.
A:	yeah, i think in today's society, uh, there is more credibility to be quite honest
M:	uh, yeah.
A:	i will always remember, i will tell this real quick story when i graduated from college, my first job years ago, uh, thirty years ago, twenty-nine years ago, in fact, was selling agricultural fertilizer.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
A:	i worked for the, uh, smith douglas division of borden chemical and i sold uh, you know, manure.
M:	oh, really?
A:	and, uh, i would go out and call on farmers and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that, but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls.
M:	oh, really.
A:	and so, one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that, bib overalls, and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
M:	uh.
A:	and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional
M:	right.
A:	so, uh, it was sort of,
M:	oh.
A:	you bet even back then
M:	yeah, they had to be in their own little world.
A:	so i sort, uh, been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best,
M:	uh-huh.
A:	but here again i dress casual quite a bit so,
M:	yeah.
A:	it gives you confidence. in my business if i call on the the j c penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago, then i wear coat and tie. if i call on just, uh, a normal little dealer of mine, i might be casual.
M:	uh, i have, uh i have a problem, uh-hilted skirt.
A:	i call on oshman's sporting goods, again, it may be casual or it may be coat and tie. so it depends.
M:	oh, i know.
A:	uh, probably no.
M:	oh, okay.
A:	but then it depends on who you are calling on. who you're, you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie, you just, uh, he would be missing something.
M:	right.
A:	although, he shouldn't be evaluated on that.
M:	yeah.
A:	so, it's its' just different.
M:	yeah.
A:	yes, it is. i am, uh, like a catholic and the people that go to my church, you know catholics dress very casual a lot of the times. people in jeans and in whatever, but yet the way i was raised, i am a converted catholic, the way i was raised, i was raised a baptist and like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time. i guess that has changed also.
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
A:	right.
M:	but, uh.
A:	sure.
M:	and i, i think that the, the, uh you know, the real problem with the, with the whole system is, is, uh.
A:	but . that is a very good point. i am from west virginia so i understand what you are saying there
M:	uh-huh.
A:	and it's it's a very good point.
M:	and it's hard to believe that, you know, that the average person can't afford, you can't imagine, you, you have to pay that much money to, to go out and do something like that.
A:	but you shouldn't, what's the old saying, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
M:	uh, well, that's true.
A:	and, uh, evaluation of an individual. course, all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have. i think you have to dress sort of accordingly.
M:	right.
A:	but, uh, you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and, uh, or evaluate a person by that.
M:	right.
A:	what about season to season. does, i guess your dress changes.
M:	well, uh.
