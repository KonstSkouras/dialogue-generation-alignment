A:	it's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
M:	uh, right.
A:	and
M:	i don't know if you have that up there but i do, i have a friend who has a, a, uh a regular old horse, uh uh, carton that he, uh he keeps in the back of his truck and, uh
A:	right, right.
M:	it's a little harder to get the hang of, but it's, it's a lot more fun.
A:	well, i do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if i go, in the summer time i try to jog, jog a couple of miles
M:	uh, uh.
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
M:	yeah.
A:	but so, i'm not quite getting the level that i need to.
M:	yeah, yeah, that, that was, that had to be a real challenge, too.
A:	i like it.
M:	yeah, i do, too.
A:	i like it, uh, part of my problem is i have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
M:	uh, that's true.
A:	of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
M:	yeah, i have to agree with that. i have, uh i have a daughter who is a sophomore in college up in massachusetts. and, uh  i, i thought it would be neat to be able to go to a, a college party with other friends and have a few people come with,  you know.
A:	right, you don't notice it  as much,
M:	yeah, i don,
A:	yeah.
M:	yeah, i'm in college, i don't even know if i ever go to a gym, you probably don't go to like a gymnasium or something like that.
A:	you feel it, don't you?
M:	yeah.
A:	it's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for, oh, i don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places and things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
M:	right.
A:	but, uh, so, do you do, uh, in texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
M:	uh, i'm not sure. i'm, i, i do know that, uh
A:	do you enjoy it, or is it, uh. if you can have, find the time it's just the.
M:	well, it depends on the person, i guess. i don, i, i enjoy it. uh, i think i'm, i like to work out with people, you, you don't have to be physically powerful to do it.
A:	yeah, it is hard
M:	uh,
A:	it is hard. it's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
M:	right.
A:	my problem is i don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
M:	uh, well, i have to admit i'm not as good as i thought i'd be.
A:	don't get enough sleep as it is, right
M:	yeah.
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
M:	uh, yeah it is.
A:	you feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
M:	uh, yeah
A:	if i eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
M:	right.
A:	i do. i have to be real careful.
M:	yeah.
A:	did you?
M:	yeah.
A:	makes a lot of difference.
M:	yeah.
A:	well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
M:	oh, yeah.
A:	right.
M:	and you know, it's not like it's, it doesn't, it, it goes right down to the tablespoon or tablespoon.
A:	and unless you really like, uh, fish. fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
M:	right, i do, too.
A:	kind of see what happens.
M:	but, uh
A:	i've tried to do that with sugar
M:	uh-huh.
A:	everything has sugar in it . i mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
M:	right, right.
A:	course, and i like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
M:	yeah, yeah,
A:	but. anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
