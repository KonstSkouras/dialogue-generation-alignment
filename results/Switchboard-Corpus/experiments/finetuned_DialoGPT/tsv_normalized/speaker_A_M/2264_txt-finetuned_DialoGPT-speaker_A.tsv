M:	oh no.
A:	so if they would come up curbside recycling
M:	yeah that's true.
A:	well now have they moved them behind wal-mart?
M:	yeah they they have they've moved them i think they moved the other one um to a different place and uh they're trying to to put some recycling there and it's just uh.
A:	oh god.
M:	they're they're really trying to trying to start that trend.
A:	oh. that's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing. because to take it to a metco  you have to take it when they're open you know which is always a real pain.
M:	yeah we've i've had to stop and think about that because um i don't know it's just i just it it seems ridiculous.
A:	and so when that thing came up in wal-mart parking lot we thought oh this is great. and we started taking them up there. and then all the sudden it disappeared you know i didn't know. and we're going oh no there goes our recycling place.
M:	yeah.
A:	that's really nice to find out that it's behind there well we pretty much do um plastic milk cartons and um um um newspapers. i couldn't even think of what you call them.
M:	oh really?
A:	plastic milk cartons newspapers and cans and glass i guess is the four is really the four things that we do.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	i guess we've got to wait a little bit.
A:	and really that's about that's really about it. is there anything any place else that really takes anything other than that that you know of?
M:	uh we uh we have uh.
A:	oh really.
M:	uh-huh.
A:	i know.
M:	so.
A:	i know. i know. we're kind of the same way. you know at first you know you at first it was a real it was a real hassle and i'm wondering are we really going to do this but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know where it becomes is automatic now to throw different things in different places
M:	uh-huh.
A:	you know. so i just go you know we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know we just kind of dump things in each one if you know if we get them
M:	uh-huh.
A:	so.
M:	well i think that's really important.
A:	oh they do too. and they're impossible to crush. i mean you can't get the down to any size you know. if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily so. you know
M:	well i don't know.
A:	oh really.
M:	yeah and i and and it's it's been a real problem for me.
A:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and uh they were real convenient and uh.
A:	oh that will be good.
M:	so.
A:	sure. let somebody get something out of it.
M:	yeah yeah it's a real good idea.
A:	yeah
M:	i mean that's just that that just isn't right.
A:	ha-ha well i was kind of hoping with you know do you work for t i?
M:	yeah i do.
A:	no. yeah. there was a t i has got this organization called t a d which is t i'ers against drugs. and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know and that's they use the money from that to fund this t i'ers against drugs program. it's you know t i doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that. and they had talked about having a thing like one saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know
M:	yeah.
A:	and i'm kind of like yeah. i shall they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it you know. that was going to use it for good so
M:	well i think that's a great idea.
A:	sounds like you have a little one just like i do
M:	yeah i do.
A:	yeah. mine was two in december
M:	oh my goodness.
A:	well it was good to talk to you.
M:	it was good talking to you too.
A:	oh do they really. curbside pick up?
M:	oh yeah and uh it's it it is really weird. they have uh a little bit of a strangler down there.
A:	i really hope they do that in louisville. it would make it a lot easier on all of us. talk to you later.
M:	all righty.
A:	bye-bye.
