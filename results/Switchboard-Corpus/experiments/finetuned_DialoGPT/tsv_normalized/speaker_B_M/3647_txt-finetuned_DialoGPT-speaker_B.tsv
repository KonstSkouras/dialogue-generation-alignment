B:	yes, we're not too long distance today.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	oh, that was good. utah, i've had a couple of, but that was it.
M:	yeah, i, i just, uh, i'm trying to think of the other one that i've seen recently that was pretty good was, uh. i don't know if you saw that one.
B:	yeah.
M:	what part of the country are you from?
B:	learned about their basketball team
M:	uh-huh.

B:	right.
M:	okay. well, we're supposed to be talking about advice about child care.
B:	right.
M:	and i'm gene hackman.
B:	right.
M:	what do you think about the, uh, benefits of the working for a large corporation?
B:	uh-huh. well, i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job.
M:	uh,
B:	i'm a nurse and i work,
M:	uh.
B:	i float so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
M:	yeah.
B:	so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i, i make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
M:	yeah, that's, that, that sounds good to me. i think that's really a, a good way to do it.
B:	right. uh-huh.
M:	i don't know.
B:	yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
M:	uh-hums. right.
B:	and then i have my freedom. i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do.
M:	uh-hums.
B:	well, it is to me. most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,
M:	yeah.
B:	and i'm just really not interested in all that.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i, i, i guess i'm, i'm more interested in what's going on in the world than what's actually happening.
B:	right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah. right, and especially if you have a family.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	then i think it makes a big difference.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh, i don't know, i think that's really important.
B:	right.
M:	i don't know, i, i think that's good.
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	and, and, uh.
B:	right. could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?
M:	uh, i felt like i could make my own schedule and, and work out, and, uh i found that, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	uh, i've got to have flexible hours.
B:	oh, well, i guess, retirement, that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so
M:	yeah, that, that would be good, too.
B:	i just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i'm not sure that i would want my kids to go to day care
B:	right.
M:	and, uh.
