B:	right.
M:	i think that's just, i think it's a matter of opinion. i think they have to decide whether or not they want a jury of their peers.
B:	right. there's, there, this topic is kind of mute. uh
M:	right, right.
B:	there, there's no way. we, we couldn't survive in a in a juror in a trial system without a jury.
M:	i know. i don't think there's a lot of people that would be willing to go to a trial for a minor thing.
B:	uh, one man can never be, one man, one woman can never be objectionable in every case.
M:	that's right. that's right, that's right and i think that's a, a, that is a good, a good point.
B:	uh, every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult. uh.
M:	yeah.
B:	right.
M:	but they're still going to be out there, you just can't stop them.
B:	right. they shouldn't allow an appeal.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that
B:	yep.
M:	i mean, it's, it, it can be a very long time.
B:	uh-huh
M:	i mean, they, they have no right to know.
B:	oh, that's right. i work for a law firm
M:	oh.
B:	right.
M:	and i think they're expecting a, a lawsuit by the lawyers because of the way the system is right now.
B:	well plea plea bargaining is a different story.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	plea bargaining is something completely different. that, that actually prevents trials. or at least speeds them up.
M:	yeah.
B:	right.
M:	and they're all going to serve the rest of their life.
B:	right.
M:	but, uh.
B:	huh.
M:	and i think,  they, they're afraid of the, of the public letting them get away from it.  because they know they're going to get caught.
B:	right.
M:	and, and i think it's, i don't know, it's a little hard to believe that, that, you know, a lot, a majority of the people don't realize just how many, how many horrible things that have to be done to keep the prisons full.
B:	we do
M:	we should have more prisons.
B:	right.
M:	and it's not going to stop only those people, but those that are committing the murders, too.
B:	right. when you're saying as far as the appeal, uh, procedure was concerned.
M:	yeah.
B:	we just have the case, i'm, i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	uh, his last appeal was, was denied two days before his sentence was up
M:	uh.
B:	so, i mean, his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail for cocaine possession.
M:	oh.
B:	but, uh, that was absurd there is never, there was no reason  the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence.
M:	oh.
B:	well, uh, the, the only i can, i you know, the, appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of. uh, like i said, as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence, that's absurd. there's no way that could work.
M:	right.
B:	uh, but,
M:	i, i think, i mean, i'm not for sure that, you know
B:	oh, exactly.
M:	and, and i mean, i would have been so mad.
B:	exactly. right.
M:	you know, you're just like, god, i'm not going to do this i'm going to shoot myself.
B:	no one would want the job
M:	right.
B:	uh, and, you know, like i said, the, you know, everyone has their opinions about every case.
M:	right.
B:	oh yeah. i, i feel that everyone is, everyone is, uh, entitled to a trial by jury. that, that, that right
M:	!!!et!!
B:	well, i mean, were there witnesses?
M:	yeah, there was witnesses that, you, you could say?
B:	right. right. that you can't, you can't remove the jury regardless of the case.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	and you, you'd still, there's still mitigating circumstances
M:	yeah, and, and that's, and i think that, you know, there should be some way of, uh, you, uh you can be selective about jury, too, because there are circumstances, you have to be selective in jury selection, too.
