B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah, sure. uh-huh. yeah. yeah. uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.
M:	well, i think it depends on the person.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that, that's, that, you know, the, the average american is now going to be embarrassed for what he did.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh uh, i was the only one that, that i was able to, to actually get into a job with, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i did that for about four years.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	that's what i did when i was growing up, was i wore, uh shorts and a t-shirt,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i went home and i went to the store and bought a pair of those and i said, well, i'm not going to have to wear those.
B:	oh, really?
M:	and i went out and bought me a dress.
B:	even the farmers.
M:	yeah, well, that's true, but, uh.
B:	oh, wow.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, certainly.
M:	yeah, it's a, it is a, uh a very casual, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah, it depends. sure. uh, so you don't, uh, if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?

M:	but, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and so, uh.
B:	right, right.
M:	he should be.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, that, uh, if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh uh, yeah. i'm, i am, uh, i go to the church of christ. i have been raised in the church of christ and, uh, but, uh, i, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your sunday best uh, uh, and dress and proper attire
M:	uh,
B:	and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when i see in other economic areas like in kentucky.
M:	well, see, i live in texas.
B:	you know, people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because  they don't have the clothes to wear.
M:	right, well,  that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i am also from westvirginia where the blacks are so busy.
B:	yeah.
M:	uh, i, i think that, uh, that, that the, uh
B:	certainly.
M:	you know, if you've got the room, the space to put things, then you can do what you want with it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	when you're in a, in a corporate environment, i think it's, it's important to be very casual.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, that's not always true.
B:	uh, yeah a little bit. uh, uh of course in the summer if i can get away with it, i wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts and that's it. run around barefoot, no shirt or anything but, uh,
