M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	uh, no, no not, no, this was, well, i am actually from mississippi, and, so that's,
M:	uh.
B:	it, it was around there generally.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, that's where the family grew.
M:	oh, that is neat.
B:	yeah, and it was not only in mississippi, in some other places, as well,
M:	uh.
B:	so. it was, uh, it was a big deal, but, uh, they tried to, to centralize it in one spot. so, in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year.
M:	uh.
B:	we rent a pavilion and, and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good. and, uh, they will rent a pavilion on a weekend, and uh
M:	oh, that's great.
B:	i have not gone back lately. in fact, uh, this past sunday was the, was the reunion, but i did not get to go. uh, i have,
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	not getting to go.
M:	uh, uh.
B:	uh, just, uh, the distance involved and,
M:	what was it?
B:	uh, just not, i have a younger daughter now and, uh, i, it's kind of hard to get her, get her there, and everything.
M:	yeah.
B:	but i am going to, to, uh, hopefully next year get to go back, cause, uh, a lot of the family has not, uh, on her side, my mother's side, has not seen, you know, my daughter, so
M:	uh.
B:	i have one brother, so.
M:	oh, that's good.
B:	yes.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	right, yeah.
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	right, i, i usually see her a, couple times a year so that's no, no big thing. but, uh, i, uh, i do, i do enjoy the reunions. the only problem is that now, uh, originally when we had them, uh, they were mainly my mother's
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, father's. my mother's father's family had quite a few, uh, brothers and sisters.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, uh, from that descendants.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and, uh, a lot of those people have, and at time, you know, they all knew one another.
M:	yeah.
B:	and now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are have, uh, have died off, or, you know, what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used to be. so, i think people feel less of a desire to really go. i know that,
M:	yeah.
B:	well, i, i just think that, uh, you know, at that when, when they were you know, the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same geographical location.
M:	uh-hau, uh.
B:	you know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community.
M:	right.
B:	and as, as time grew, i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. and now when they come together it's, it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another and i do not think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there. which is a shame
M:	uh, uh.
B:	but that's just how it is. my mother was complaining last year about you know, it's dwindling down every year, you know, that's just, i think that's just
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that
B:	well, yeah. yeah, that's, uh, yeah, i think that's some of it. but, you know, i have, uh, i, i, it's just the way, you know, i think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.
M:	uh, well, i know my mother's always worked and i know how important it is to have a family.
B:	it's more of a, you know, a smaller, smaller unit, and you know, we, we tend to try to do things, i think with our immediate family, as opposed to the extended family. of people that we may or may not remember or know, you know, very well.
M:	right. right.
B:	uh
M:	i mean, i don't know. i don, i really don't, i mean, it just seems like, uh
B:	right, it requires a lot of effort to, to, to do that sort of thing.
M:	yeah, yeah, i, i agree with that. i think, uh, that, uh that, i know, uh you know, i think that it's very difficult to, uh
B:	i mean, i, i used to enjoy going, i mean i still do kind of enjoy it, but, uh, it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that i really, really enjoy seeing.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	you know, i, it's going just for the sake of getting together, i think for the family. and,
M:	right.
B:	uh, um, um, no, not really. in that, but, then again, uh, well, i, you know, i have some aunts that, uh, i, i, i do. that's about my mother's sisters, you know,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but i feel closer to them, because i kind of grew up with them. but, but, uh, as, you know, for the rest of that group, no not really.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	uh, you know, and, and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people, the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion, so, uh
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	you do not really feel that that really close to them.
M:	no.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	that's a good idea.
M:	so,
B:	right.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!
B:	yeah. right.
M:	but, uh,
B:	yeah.
M:	so, you know, that was, that worked out pretty good.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so, i am really looking forward to that.
