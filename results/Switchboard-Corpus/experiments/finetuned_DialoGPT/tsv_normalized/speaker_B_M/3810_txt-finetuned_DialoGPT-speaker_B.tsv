B:	so

B:	um.
M:	and uh.
B:	oh yeah.
M:	and so uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so he's he's really into that. um i i don't know i think that um you know that i guess the the most important thing is that you don't have to be so totally out of it to like go to a concert or something.
B:	oh they did?
M:	yeah.
B:	how did how did they get involved in that?
M:	uh they just uh went and bought a flute and played the flute together.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh they had a a they uh they had like a sign up and they had people there you know sign up for uh classes and things like that.
B:	oh how fun.
M:	so uh they they got a lot of participation and they uh and then the the city said well we don't want any of our children involved. we want to focus on our own children.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	um uh-huh um. yeah yeah that's nice. you say have your four year old taking lessons already?
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	and uh who do you have her or him take it from?
M:	well it's uh it's kind of hard to say. uh he's he has uh a uh i guess a mixed breed between uh uh uh...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but um it's it is it it does give you a sense of uh uh of security.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and and it it's a lot of fun. i i really enjoy that. i haven't gotten around to uh  doing that yet.
B:	oh.
M:	and he just he just can't read so.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! translated!! english!!ety!! translate!!
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	but uh.
B:	well because my
M:	but uh i have a i've got a dog also.
B:	pardon me?
M:	do you go to any musicals?
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
M:	uh.
B:	because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. she just
M:	oh that's wonderful.
B:	so i wasn't sure when to start her. i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
M:	uh-oh uh-hoh.
B:	uh-huh yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i think that's kind of a waste of a person.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and of course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
M:	right.
B:	it was something easily forgotten. so uh i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven. i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. she does have to really work at it but uh so
M:	well i guess that's that's what i mean by uh.
B:	yeah but so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i i know a lot of people that work in the system and they they say they spend a lot more time on the computer than they do actually on the actual answering machine.
B:	uh-huh. oh that's good.
M:	so
B:	well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method have you had any former suzuki students?
M:	well i have uh.
B:	i was wondering how
M:	yeah.
