M:	what, what does it mean?
B:	exactly, yeah, um,
M:	it doesn't seem like it's as hard on the joints as it is on the, uh.
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
M:	yeah, that's, that, that was one of the big selling points of the new aerobics equipment.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh. how about you?
M:	well, um i'm in graduate school right now so i, i'm not,
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	so i don't, i don relate to that at all.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
M:	well, i do enjoy it. uh, i, i think it is a lot of work.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i'm a little bit more, uh, refined, i guess i'd say.
B:	uh-huh. sure, yeah.
M:	and so i, i try to, i do a lot more planning when i'm with my children, you see.
B:	uh-huh, yeah. uh, i, um, i used to, uh, i used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now i weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. um, so i drastically had to change the way i ate when i, when i first moved to college, and, uh, i had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so i got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when i'm not fat like i used to be  i don't worry about it
M:	yeah.
B:	, yeah.
M:	and, uh  you know.
B:	uh-huh. although lately i have noticed, you know, even if i gain, like two pounds, i start, i start feeling it and,
M:	well, that's good.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i know, i know. i'm, i'm a little bit surprised. i was, i was thinking, you, you'd think you'd get more from exercise, you would get more out of it.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah, there are. um, i'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
M:	uh-uh. uh,
B:	uh-huh yeah, i really do, because i like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
M:	well, i know, i, i do too, but i'm so, i mean, i don't enjoy it at all.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you have to get yourself in a position where you can relax a little bit.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, so, you're right. i think it's just, i think the, the, i don't know, i guess the most significant thing that i think we've done in this, this past few years is, um, i've been involved in, in, uh uh, international campaigns.
B:	exactly.
M:	and i don t want to do it.
B:	uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
M:	and i need to, i need something to do, i've got to get up early in the morning and do that.
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. yeah, yeah.
M:	so you don't have to be in shape for school either.
B:	uh-huh. do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
M:	uh, yeah, yeah i don't, i don, i mean i don've, i haven't been doing that, i guess i stopped subscribing, uh, about, probably about a year and a half ago.
B:	uh-huh. i stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	uh-huh, completely. i mean, any kind of meat or, and i, and i really feel a lot better now.
M:	!!!%
B:	yeah, it really does.
M:	really does. i know that my husband used to eat a lot more beef than he does now. he used to, but he, he doesn't anymore.
B:	uh-huh, yeah, that's it, i mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
M:	uh, i don't know, i guess i'm, i'm more, i think i'm eating more chicken than i am,
B:	and so. i found that really helps.
M:	yeah, that sounds good.
B:	yeah, i eat that, i think i've eaten fish like twice since. i used to eat a lot of fish, too, but i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
M:	uh-oh.
B:	yeah, and i like it.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i don't know if i'm that brave yet .
M:	no, i, i'm not brave, i just have a very good handle on it. i, uh, i try to keep it on a minimum amount of foods that i can, uh.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and i just don't like it, so i don't,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i like to have a salad.
B:	okay, yeah, it sounds good.
M:	it was nice talking with you.
B:	well, good luck to you there in idaho.
M:	!!!%!! remind me. okay.
B:	well, i'm in graduate school now. i, i, i kind of feel like i wish i could have gone back to undergraduate now
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah. yeah, it is. well, it's good talking,
M:	well it was nice talking to you.
B:	pardon? i'm studying speech pathology.
M:	oh, okay.
