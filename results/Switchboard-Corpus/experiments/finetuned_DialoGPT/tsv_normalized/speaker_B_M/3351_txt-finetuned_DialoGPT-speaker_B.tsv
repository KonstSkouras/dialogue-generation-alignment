M:	tobias, liberty. they're about the only type of pet i've had that i would want to have a pet by a couple of people.
B:	tibby is the dog and liberty is the cat.
M:	and what's the, uh, what's their name?
B:	oh.
M:	and, uh, we just have a regular old two door.
B:	oh ours are pretty calm.
M:	yeah, ours is.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, they're, they are, uh they're not house pets, but they are really sweet dogs.
B:	yeah. our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. so that's why we call her liberty.
M:	uh, i'm sure that, uh, the, the cats in the litter box are different from the ones that we have.
B:	do you want to hear about my other animals i've had?
M:	yeah
B:	i've had a skunk
M:	oh.
B:	i've had a burmese python, i've had rats, i've had mice
M:	oh, well.
B:	uh, let's see, i've had gerbils, i have, i had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	so at one point i had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
M:	oh, my goodness.
B:	yes
M:	oh, my goodness.
B:	it was litter trained
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	and we had it perfumed
M:	!!!%!! translated we, we had a german shorthair.
B:	and, uh, it was very aggressive.
M:	uh, that's interesting.
B:	but all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	nobody came near it when he was there.
M:	yeah, that's, that, that is a big problem.
B:	oh.
M:	and the skunks got scared and he bit him.
B:	yeah, they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them, but the glands had been removed
M:	oh, no.
B:	so,
M:	well, that's a good thing, though.
B:	right.
M:	so,
B:	yeah, i always said if i well, i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog
M:	uh-huh.
B:	that'd be the best way to be.
M:	i think so, too.
B:	well we had a german shepherd and he had dysplasia
M:	oh, that's terrible.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
M:	uh, uh-hauhuh, uh, uh.
B:	so, when he died, we got a little one.
M:	oh, my goodness.
B:	but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	well, that's, that is sad.
B:	yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
M:	oh, gosh.
B:	so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
M:	uh, i know, i don't know, you, you don't think about the things that go on around you, i think, i, i'm not going to have to worry about that.
B:	and then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico now.
M:	oh, yeah, that's a cat too.
B:	do you?
M:	uh-huh.

B:	and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat, and he let her out, and my house was loaded with fleas, i mean, you walked in and your legs were just black.
M:	oh.
B:	and we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
