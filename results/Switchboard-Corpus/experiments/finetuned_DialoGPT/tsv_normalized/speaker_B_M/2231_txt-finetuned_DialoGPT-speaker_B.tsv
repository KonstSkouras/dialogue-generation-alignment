B:	and that, that, the penalty ought to be out there, and be enforced?
M:	yeah, i agree. i mean, i don't know, i'm, i mean i'm not for it, i just don't think it should, you know, it should stay in effect.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh, i think it ought to, it ought not to be in so few years. i mean, i don't know, i'm not sure what the laws are on that, but i think they ought to go.
B:	that's, i agree with that completely. i know we don't have enough prisons, but there has got to be some kind of punishment, for these people.
M:	right.
B:	because if they turn around, they can get away, they get away with it, and they get away with it, and they get away with it, and then they do something worse
M:	right.
B:	and they get a slap on the wrist. they get, thirty days in jail
M:	right.
B:	and they final get up to where they kill somebody else, and they go through fourteen appeals, and how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.
M:	uh.
B:	and it's, well, they certainly are living off our at our expense.
M:	right.
B:	i didn't ,
M:	i mean, i don't know how you feel about that, but,
B:	yeah.
M:	and i, i, you know, i just feel like, you, you're in a bad spot, and you have to really have some resolve to stand up against this, you have a lot of self-esteem, and i, and, you can't just go out and say, well i'm sorry, i'm not going to do it, and nobody will do it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, and, and you know, they're out in the real world, and they're spending so much money and they have no concept of what's going on, you know.
B:	and, and be paroled, and and have served the sentence,
M:	right.
B:	that's what, that's what people face with that choice. one thing i really hate, is they don't explain to the jurors, in a, in a trial, in a capital murder trial, or in cases of rape, or in different things that are so horrible, what it means when they sentence them to, you know, they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's, you know, that it's going to, you know,
M:	right.
B:	that should be life, but, instead, in, in given the choice of either sentencing to death, or sentencing to life, they'll give them ninety years in prison or something, and then turn around in thirty years, that, you know, and less they're out.
M:	right.
B:	even if, if they're even in that long. or they appeal, and then they get an appeal that says it was, you know, an unjust amount of time, an extraordinary long length, or something.
M:	right.
B:	yeah. i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent, i think people know that nobody, that it doesn't, you know, it's not a deterrent right now, because it's not really effective.
M:	no.
B:	there's should be, you know, this, for this crime, this is the penalty. you killed, someone you know, in cold blood or whatever.
M:	right.
B:	this is what's going to happen.
M:	i, i, i don't know, i've, i'm not sure i'm, i mean, i see some aspects to it, but, i'd, i would say that i don, i wouldn't want to see it, you, you have to have a state that does something like that.
B:	and, i mean, it sounds horrible. it, i hear myself saying this, and, but, i, don't know what else to do with some of these people, that are,
M:	well, they're not,
B:	because they let them back out again, and they do the same thing over,  and over,  again,
M:	i know. uh-huh.
B:	then they put them back in jail, and they get out, and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
M:	yes.
B:	and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system.
M:	yes, they do, they are, they're just getting,
B:	and it's like i said at our expense.
M:	yeah.
B:	yes.
M:	so, it's, it, it can happen to anyone and it's happened to me, too.
B:	i know, i, you read about it in the paper, every day, somebody who's done this, or that, something really horrible
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and they just get away with it, and nothing happens.
M:	right.
B:	yeah. i think i think texas is texas, the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty, and i think, i know california had it for a long time, and then they, uh, took it off the books, they repealed it
M:	uh-hope.
B:	and people like charles manson, and, and some of these other people, who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty, were sentenced to life in prison, and are now, now that even though california has reinstated the death penalty, for whatever various crimes. the people who were there originally, when they, when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty, are still in there for, are in prison, in quote, for life, and, and are now coming up for parole, some of them, like manson who's come up you know
M:	uh, yeah.
B:	it's been denied fortunately but,
M:	yeah, that's true.
B:	yeah.
M:	and it's a, a, it's, it was a, you know, it is a tough issue, but, uh, you can see that there's a lot of people that are, you just have to accept it, and that's not a bad thing.
B:	well, the jury that sentenced him, sentenced him to death
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal, the state of california revoked the law in the early seventies, and then they reinstated it later, but the penalty didn't go back. you know?
M:	huh.
B:	it seems like a lot of times the law is, is totally on the criminal side, and, and isn't protecting the rest of the people.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's just, it's just not as, it seems like they're not really making any effort to protect the victim.
B:	yeah. and the, the laws are all, the rules. some of the things that would make sense to, to tell the jury, that this, this guy has a, a prior criminal history, you know, where he's raped ten women
M:	uh,
B:	and then he gets up for this one trial, and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
B:	and so they say, well, this is, you know, i, i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever, but they give him a lighter sentence, thinking he's not a habitual criminal.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah, yeah. well, to some extent if they would do something with some of those people. but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too.
M:	i don't, i mean, they, they get so easily swayed by emotion.
B:	they plead insanity
M:	yeah.
B:	and then three years later they're cured, and let loose on society again.
M:	uh-hue.
B:	i mean, it's a it's a scary world out there anymore, where your afraid to go out,
M:	uh-hue.
B:	i know, in, in the dallas metroplex area, i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i, i certainly, i, i grew up in a smaller town in texas, and it wasn't that way when i was younger.
M:	uh, uh-hue.
B:	we could go around, and, boy and,
M:	it's, it's, uh, it is nice to get out and see other people, you know. you, you don't feel like you're alone, but you feel like your, your, you're not quite as, as much of a person, and you don, you have other responsibilities.
B:	yes. ever, you can't even, when i was a kid, i would run between my neighbors, three and four blocks sometimes, and, as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time,
M:	uh, that's true.
B:	and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard, that i can't see them.
M:	uh, that's a, that, that is a problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh,
B:	well, good talking to you too. bye,
M:	bye.
B:	bye.
M:	okay.
