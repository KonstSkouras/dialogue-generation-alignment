B:	do they have many buildings that have security there?
M:	yes they have security.
B:	yeah yeah well i i went to dallas uh when i worked for t i in abilene and uh i'm a little familiar with the city area forest lane and you know through that off off the freeway.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part. you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
M:	uh.
B:	and the cities are very populated with tenement housing where there are more than one family in a house. and with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language
M:	uh.
B:	and uh they're going to the big cities. it makes it very difficult.
M:	uh i know uh.
B:	it really does and and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before. drugs of course uh a big part of it i think.
M:	yeah.
B:	and uh i don't know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes.
M:	yeah.
B:	that that's really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever.
M:	yeah i i think that's true.
B:	yeah.
M:	and you just don't hear anybody talk about it.
B:	it is and and i don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television.
M:	well that that would be a good idea. i think i think the other thing that's good is the fact that the uh the parents are always saying you you can do this or you can stay at home.
B:	and i i really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people.
M:	!!!% yeah i agree.
B:	uh uh.
M:	i mean they they've got the the parole thing and the uh they've they have the they just you you go through the you just go through a period of time where you say okay this is the punishment phase and then when it's all over and over and it's over and they just hang around for a while and then they you get out and they're paroled.
B:	yeah exactly.
M:	and they're out there doing it again.
B:	and uh you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter. he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone. now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was. and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her and the whole bit.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out.
M:	wow.
B:	and the man said that you know if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself. and then go to mcdonalds and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it.
M:	yeah.
B:	and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands. and that innocent people
M:	uh.
B:	i i shouldn't say innocent because i mean actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but
M:	right.
B:	the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things.
M:	right.
B:	sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things i don't know
M:	yeah well i don i mean i don tinker too much with it but i i do i have a hard time you're right. i do stuff you don't have to be so uh obsessive about it that you don taint over it.
B:	i i like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country and they come to this country and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported.
M:	right.
B:	especially if they're found guilty of the crime.
M:	right.
B:	you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty.
M:	yeah.
B:	that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them nothing
M:	yeah.
B:	i mean they go right back where they came from.
M:	right.
B:	exactly and
M:	so
B:	but that's uh they're so close i i don't consider mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	like you take asian countries or uh the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground
M:	uh-hue.
B:	and it's like you know um they live back in where we came from two hundred years ago.
M:	uh that's true.
B:	you know we've advanced beyond that and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they said that they're very very conservative and that they don't want to be associated with that type of thing.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i thought well if you just train them you can make them do your job
B:	wow.
M:	!!! remind me of that.
B:	wow. you better believe it if you wouldn't even have to leave it i mean
M:	you know i'm not sure if you're a true uh vegan or not but you know you're not supposed to eat any animal products unless you you die of leukemia or something like that.
B:	it would get snatched right off your arm
M:	right.
B:	oh sure.
M:	i mean you know it's not like it's a big deal.
B:	that's amazing well what's the difference there do you know?
M:	i don't know. i i'm not really sure. i think it's just the difference in the in the women's lib and the the more liberal uh  lib women's movements.
B:	oh i i believe in the death penalty i really do.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah yeah i think that we're too easy.
M:	i i do think that uh if uh.
B:	uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far.
M:	right.
B:	you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there. they put themselves in that situation.
M:	right.
B:	and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have.
M:	yeah.
B:	i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again.
M:	right.
B:	i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives.
M:	yeah.
B:	i think that they should be put away.
M:	well i don't know. i think they ought to you know if they get out of jail they ought not to be allowed to have parole.
B:	get rid of them. exactly. i i really i i think that that's the whole key here. this plea bargaining baloney where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time
M:	uh uh-hue.
B:	or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior for every year they're in they get so many less you know that they don't serve the full penalty.
M:	uh
B:	i i i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this.
M:	right.
B:	yeah same with drunk drivers.
M:	!!!!!!%!!you!!it!!i!!that!!?!!well!!yeah!!nice!! you!!they!!have!! translated!!one!!one!!two!!we!!and!! rem!!same!!okay!!good!! same!!great!!so!!oh!!
B:	i think it's too easy for them.
M:	yeah.
B:	that if the the laws and and were were harsher and were enforced
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	i mean you have to set an example. you have to start somewhere.
M:	right.
B:	and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again.
M:	yeah.
B:	an it an i feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people. this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job
M:	uh
B:	and let's face it what do they get paid.
M:	right.
B:	twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky. i wouldn't do it for that.
M:	oh i wouldn tinker with that. i mean you'd be surprised.
B:	it is it really is. and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything.
M:	that's true.
B:	you know and i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything
M:	uh yeah.
B:	but they they're already uh have three strikes against them when they're out there.
M:	right.
B:	because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say
