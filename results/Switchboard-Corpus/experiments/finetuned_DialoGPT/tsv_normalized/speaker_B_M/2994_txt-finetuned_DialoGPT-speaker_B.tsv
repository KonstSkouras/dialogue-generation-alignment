B:	yeah. and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
M:	right.
B:	you're supposed to what.
M:	well, i mean, they, they've been doing that for years, but they've also been doing it for a couple of years now.
B:	but what are you supposed to do with them. oh, okay.
M:	!!!;!!%!! remind me.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!!!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	yeah.
M:	but they're, uh, i think they're out of season yet.
B:	we, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit and then we take them, take them in.
M:	uh-uh. uh-hum.
B:	yeah, we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,
M:	uh,
B:	so, we generally don't have those to do.
M:	right.
B:	you know, they, they charge you, you know, it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage.
M:	uh, i know.
B:	and i know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
M:	yeah.
B:	they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
M:	right, right.
B:	that that might be a better way to do it.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
M:	right.
B:	you know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if i just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and you put it in your car, and they, they pick it up at the curb.
B:	oh, yeah that's about the same kind of thing.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!ets!! that's how we do it.
B:	where do you live?
M:	in plano.
B:	oh, okay.
M:	so, yeah.
B:	yes.
M:	okay.
B:	it seems like they would be able to.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i think it would be a good idea to have, you know, maybe some kind of a fund set up for people to use for things like that.
B:	yeah.
M:	and they're not going to, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	so, it's, uh, i don't, i haven't, you know, i hadn't, uh
B:	yeah, that's true .
M:	so, i don know.
B:	um, now i didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	okay.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me.
B:	okay.
M:	bye-bye.
