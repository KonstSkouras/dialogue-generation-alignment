B:	right
M:	and we all enjoy it. um.
B:	well, i, i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well, a little bit for the price,
M:	yeah.
B:	but, uh, i think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places i've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etingrange!!ival!! there you go.
B:	really. um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
M:	um.
B:	some of the, some of the best food i have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like, i'm not eating in there are you nuts? and, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	i bet.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	i'm serious.
M:	really?
B:	um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to atchafalaya.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	no, that's not right. that's not right. that's not right.
M:	that's not even right. um, i, i think that's the worst thing i think we could come up with. i think, i mean, i don't know, it just, i'm not sure what the criteria are. i guess i, it's, i guess it's not just, you know, i don't know. i mean i do, i have not been in the situation where, uh.
B:	someone in the what's the name of that restaurant? in the background where at? . someone in the background the hari krishna. in the background relies oh. kalachandji's . kalachandji's. it's all vegetarian, and it, it was just fabulous. i mean, my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it.
M:	!!!;!!et!!you sound like you're a real cookbook freak.
B:	um, kalachandji's. it's, uh, it's a hari krishna run restaurant.
M:	oh.
B:	yes.
M:	!!!eston!!i've never been there.
B:	uh, i think so. it should be.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	uh, it starts with a k.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	so k a l a, i think, c h a n d.
M:	right.
B:	that should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. i think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
M:	yeah, it is, it's in the, uh-huh menu.
B:	but it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
M:	oh, i love their food. my husband really likes it.
B:	well, we like arby's. as far as, fast food goes.
M:	oh, yes.
B:	oh, really? why?
M:	because they're, they're terrible.
B:	oh, no, no, no. someone has been lying to you. what they use is roast beef.
M:	yeah.
B:	that's what, oh, my goodness.
M:	and they said, well, you know, it's, it is, it was like roast, but it's not like, like, uh, beef, you put in the rice, and you put, uh.
B:	i'm surprised. my dad worked for arby's for several years.
M:	arby's, i wonder why.
B:	yeah.
M:	oh, really?
B:	well, that's happened before.
M:	yeah, and it's happened a lot.
B:	but we like good uh, we're, we like mexican food.
M:	yeah. oh, that sounds good.
B:	and stuff like that. and so, um,
M:	what, what kind of mexican food do you like?
B:	a health food?
M:	uh-huh.
B:	like, like, name one
M:	yeah, i don't know, i, i think i've seen them, uh
B:	i'm not sure what you're talking about.
M:	uh, i don't know, i guess it's just like, you know, the health food is just so expensive, you can't afford it.
B:	huh.
M:	and it's a very health- inspiring restaurant.
B:	i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so, i really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	yeah.
B:	it would be good i think,
M:	yeah, i don't know if you've ever heard of them but,
B:	uh, i don't know how expensive they are. it sounds like that it would probably,
M:	yeah, i think that would be a really good idea.
B:	for one person?
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	oh
M:	but, uh, you know, i think we're going to get, we're getting ready to get a, a new one. we've got a, we've got, a nine month old, and we're, we, we get ready to, to get her to start kindergarten next year.
B:	a bit
M:	!!! remind me.
B:	yeah, i, i won't really be interested in going to, in going there. because, i feel like i'm, i'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
M:	yeah
B:	yeah. maybe, maybe that. yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah. i could see that, then maybe.
M:	well it's, it's just a matter of how you look at it. you know, if i were, i would say that i would probably say that the people who are really committed to the cause, uh, are not going to pay any taxes are not paying a substantial amount in taxes.
B:	yeah, i like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
M:	uh.
B:	yeah. probably that's true. but i know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
M:	yeah
B:	now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
M:	well it's good, it's just good for you, it has a good, uh
B:	that's one of my husband's pet peeves. he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, really?
M:	yeah, they're, they were really, uh, you would have to be, uh.
B:	oh, catfish is wonderful.
M:	i have never eaten catfish.
B:	oh, really.
M:	yeah, and i love that.
B:	really.
M:	and, uh, you know, they've, they, they check for drugs.
B:	why?
M:	they have a place at resurrection lutheran church that will accept you as an alternate
B:	oh. huh.
M:	and, uh, i mean, i'm not a great fisher but i'm, i, i don't, i guess i'm a good enough person to, to go and catch fish. i don'm.
B:	that's too bad, because i'm probably not going to stop eating it
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	and i, i, and i have been very, very, uh...
B:	that's true.
M:	and, uh.
B:	oh, on one hand i see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which i guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
M:	uh-uh. uh-hum. uh, yes.
B:	so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
M:	oh.
B:	and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
M:	!!!% well, that's true.
B:	oh. and then they wouldn't think. they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them.
M:	yeah.
B:	and this is before i was born.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, i mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
M:	yeah.
B:	and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
M:	right.
B:	you can't get away from it so i think, to some point,
M:	so,
B:	yeah, you know. so there's, you know, there's some things i think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, this is not in my control.
M:	yeah, well, i don't know. i don, i, i think that, uh, it's, it, it just seems like it's just, it seems like there's just so much going on that it's almost overwhelming when you think of it.
B:	so i'm either going to be, i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can, you know.
M:	yeah, that's true.
