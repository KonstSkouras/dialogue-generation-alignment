B:	uh ...
M:	i don't know i think that's that's a little extreme. i don't think that uh you know. i think you should you should test for drugs just to make sure you're drug tested.
B:	oh uh i was tested uh within my company. i think it's kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i i feel like it's really just within the united states. it's uh it's okay. i think your record should stand for itself. that you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
M:	uh i uh.
B:	and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. i think they could uh save money by not doing that. you know every time say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.
M:	yeah.
B:	oh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	uh not if it's done fairly. and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	but if it is done fairly well then maybe that's a problem.
B:	well they might tell you it's random.
M:	yeah well that's true.
B:	but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery. somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries. you know.
M:	yeah. i think that's true.
B:	oh i see. how'd how did they how do they pick their people?
M:	uh they uh they go through the list of of potential applicants and and sort of weed them out.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then they have to pick from a list of of uh college athletes that they want to be drug tested.
B:	oh i see. so do you ...
M:	and uh.
B:	right. well do you think that should be implemented in the work place. you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
M:	i don't think they have the authority to say that.
B:	right.
M:	but uh
B:	right.
M:	and i think it's a big problem.
B:	right right. yeah it it would almost be like a a uh ...
M:	i i don't know i i think i it's interesting that that you know we have such a high level of self-discipline and i think it's becoming a major problem.
B:	uh-huh. and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that now.
B:	right. i agree with that. because i know personally myself i've been in the same job for three years it will be three years in august and i've already been drug tested three times.
M:	oh i see.
B:	well i'm an environmental engineer
M:	uh-oh.
B:	and i've been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus. so see i for some reason i've come up three times. that's pretty high statistics.
M:	uh do you know what i mean?
B:	no. no not at all.
M:	you know i i don't know that's that would be a tough question. i don tinker with it but uh i think that's what they they do it for.
B:	it's a legal job you know
M:	yeah it's a job that's that's for certain and uh i i don't know i just don't think that that there should be a a broad based uh policy.
B:	so see it's really strange.
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	oh uh-huh.
M:	and they asked me if i had a certain doctor and i said yes and that was it.
B:	right. well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and she came up negative.
M:	uh i think they're required to say something i don t remember what it is but they do have the uh a list of things that they want you to do.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean i've i have i'm a certified teacher and i you know i know what a drug test is and i don tinker around with it or anything.
B:	right right.
M:	and i was a little upset about that.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and i think that's one of the reasons why they were they were having a hard time with that and i think it's important that that you know they had to do something about it.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. and are they tested random?
M:	yeah they they are.
B:	they're ...
M:	and they're all tested positive for drugs.
B:	oh okay. i see.
M:	so uh yeah i mean i i would i think i would probably be more concerned with with safety than with than with the you know the quality of products.
B:	yeah.
M:	you know i i think i could work in a hospital.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and i think that's probably why.
B:	oh i see.
M:	and they they uh they're very uh...
B:	uh-huh. okay so they know that. and that's ...
M:	yeah they they really do.
B:	uh-huh. okay. well ...
M:	and i don't know if you heard about this but i'm sure you have heard of it.
B:	yeah
M:	i don't know.
B:	i think so. yeah seven twenty-five.
M:	okay well i enjoyed talking to you.
B:	okay nice speaking to you.
M:	nice talking to you too.
B:	bye.
