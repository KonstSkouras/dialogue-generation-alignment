M:	and, uh she, she, uh we, we just don't have that much spare time so, uh
B:	wow. wow. that's a, a big job.
M:	yeah, it is, it's quite a bit.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we had to get it scrub and it was all dried up and it just looked like, you know, it was just a horrible thing to do.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that's, that's a big problem.
B:	oh, sure. oh, i bet it's beautiful.
M:	well, it is, it's, uh, it, uh it's a lot different than it was when we were there.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we just cut, you, you just leave it out and then you put it in the ground.
B:	wild flowers.
M:	so, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, and, and they're beautiful. we, we have a few of them here in our neighborhood
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're gorgeous.
B:	oh, that sounds lovely. uh-huh. oh, the wild flowers are beautiful. i think, um, i was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty. then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved.
M:	well, that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it's just that, that you have to kind of, uh you have a certain amount of space in your home, you know, so that, uh
B:	uh-huh, i know a lot of
M:	well, how long have you been with them?
B:	uh-huh, a lot of women do. um, i've just never really, you know, maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow, but, um, my husband takes it on, and i'll help rake up the grass, and, um, sometimes i'll help him edge, um, because, we don't have that much property, but we're on a corner lot, so there's a lot of edging to do
M:	uh.
B:	and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country, you don't have to worry about any of that
M:	!!!%
B:	oh. oh, that's nice, i, this is different for us because the other, in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks, and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees, and we do miss that. um, if we had a chance to move, i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified and a little less maintenance required as, as far as that goes.
M:	uh-hums.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	we have, um.
B:	oh. uh-huh.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	wow that's,
M:	we're in, we've been planting some trees now, but we're not quite through, but it's been fun, and we, we'll be doing more next year,
B:	um.
M:	but we've got the, we've had the trees already planted so,
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	and i think that's really going to help. i think it's going to be a big problem in the dallas area because, uh you know, i'm not sure if the schools are doing enough, the teachers are not doing enough.
B:	right. well, i put,
M:	well, i don't know how much, how much texas, uh uh, you know, texas has per year per, per tree per year.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then we have evening glory.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	oh. oh, that sounds so pretty.
M:	so,
B:	oh really do they, don't do any damage, though, they just fly right back out, if you have the,
M:	no, no, they don't.
B:	i see.
M:	so they, they're pretty much vegetarians.
B:	i see.
M:	and so it's a real problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, um, i think it's just going to be a waste of everybody's time. i think that's the only thing that we're going to have to deal with it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i love it.
B:	oh, oh, that sounds wonderful.
M:	yeah.
B:	oh, i love home grown tomatos.
M:	uh-uh. i do too.
B:	there's nothing like them. they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
M:	uh-huh.
B:	what does that mean, accidental tomatoes?
M:	oh, just, just regular old tomatoes.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i, i've been pretty lucky. i've only had one bad tomato plant, and it was a red tomato plant.
B:	i see.
M:	so,
