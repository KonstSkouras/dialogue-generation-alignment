B:	so i think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.
M:	well, that's true.
B:	uh, you're very fortunate.
M:	and, uh
B:	we just try not to pay any more in than we have to, uh, we pay in a substantial amount. uh,
M:	well, we just, we have a, a, uh we just pay the state tax, which is, uh
B:	we don't regret paying taxes. we do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.
M:	uh, uh-hue.
B:	and progressive tax, i think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money, and what i mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.
M:	right.
B:	it should be, i think, a flat percentage and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.
M:	yeah, i agree.
B:	uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,
M:	yeah.
B:	and i totaled them all up and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.
M:	huh.
B:	now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.
M:	uh, that's true.
B:	but, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh, like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank.
M:	yeah.
B:	but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.
M:	yeah, that's true. i think, i think it's probably more obvious that people have, have a, have, uh a lower income.
B:	yeah if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.
M:	right.
B:	and, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.
M:	right.
B:	and so, based on that, who do you think you're talking to, you're talking to an employer.
M:	i think that's true. i think that, i think it's important that they check you out and make sure you're, you are, you know,
