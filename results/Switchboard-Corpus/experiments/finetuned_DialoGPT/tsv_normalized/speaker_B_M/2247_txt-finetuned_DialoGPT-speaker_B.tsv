B:	it's eighty eighty-eight?
M:	uh-huh.
B:	okay. uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it? word processing obviously.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	okay. uh i use them both here at work and at home.
M:	right.
B:	and i have i b m clones in both cases.
M:	oh yeah.
B:	here at work i have the t i one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
M:	oh really?
B:	yes it is. uh unfortunately i need all of it.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
M:	yeah.
B:	and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. just in the ability to handle.
M:	oh yeah.
B:	and then i have uh a three eighty-six f x a sixteen bit machine at home.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i'm really pleased with it.
M:	i bet.
B:	it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches.
M:	oh yeah. uh-hue.
B:	uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. have you
M:	uh.
B:	to try to make them more effective and useful.
M:	yeah and i know a lot of people who are very very against it.
B:	have you been uh struggling along those lines?
M:	no i haven't.
B:	well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it. it's uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. it was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that. of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error. not a fun thing to try to recover from.
M:	yeah.
B:	very frustrating. uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise. uh that was a engineering spec on b two. you come here with the b level of specs?
M:	uh yeah.
B:	well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. uh to one level down from assistant description.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well i sure need them. uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them.
M:	yeah.
B:	yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. when you start seeing what all they can do for you.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well i understand that you know. if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
M:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
M:	and uh-huh.
B:	uh that's came out around the first of the year.
M:	yeah i was going to say it came out with a lot of stuff.
B:	it does a few more things uh than had been available before.
M:	yeah.
B:	but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. uh you know once you get passed thirty-three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation. because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	yeah i don't know i think that's one of the big problems with with american cars. i think i it seems like uh i think it's just too too expensive.
B:	well okay. i enjoyed our discussion.
M:	yeah it was nice talking to you.
B:	you do the same.
M:	thank you.
B:	bye.
