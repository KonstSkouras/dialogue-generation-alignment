B:	okay. yeah.
M:	and, um.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and we were looking at, uh, we were going to buy a house,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	then we put aside all of our savings and all of the car bills,
B:	oh, no.
M:	so, we're just looking at, you know, what he's going to do with all of his savings and all that kind of stuff.
B:	that throws the budget out of whack real fast.
M:	right.
B:	oh, good.
M:	and, uh, we went to california this last year and, uh it was wonderful. it was like, uh-huh.
B:	really. that was smart. yeah.
M:	but, uh, we, we've, we always, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we would go and we would have taken out loans to buy a house and then we would move in and, uh we, we did not have the money to buy it.
B:	oh, uh-huh. yeah.
M:	so we went to the, uh  to the church and, and, you know, raised beds for them.
B:	wow, that's great.
M:	and, uh.
B:	did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of,
M:	just my own computer.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so i, i've got, i got a, i have a program that i did for, uh a year and a half ago that i, that i wrote, you know, it's a, it, it talks about different types of computers.
B:	gosh.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and so,
B:	well, we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids, of course, and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of of things and, uh, did really, um, you know, have a real strict but, budget but, uh, the about and to our, when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just, you know, dirt poor. then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house. so, we virtually did that for about two years,  which worked real well, and then moved from california where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved,  and moved to texas, bought a house immediately, you know, which, of course, is now devalued with the housing market,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, i don't know if we, we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live. um, so, now, since, uh, we have a three year old and a two year old now, um,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	that's, that's, that threw our budget really out of whack too. an we, um, have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids. and, um, we just really have, uh, i don't know, we, we've tried different times, we've done like a survey of like taking, you know, the past three months of where all the money went.
M:	um.
B:	and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all, but it seems like there's, um, times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a baby-sitter and we'll go and we'll blow, you know, fifty, sixty dollars in one night going out to eat, going to a show or doing something, you know.
M:	yeah.
B:	"yeah, that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it, we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for, you know, birthday for somebody or, you know, even we, we even do things real frugally for the kids, we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age, you know, whether they're jordache new or whether they're *listen; ""because"" may start new utt unit  you know, something"
M:	uh, i guess so.
B:	and they're both boys so they just one year after the other in each other's clothes, so. but, um, that's the hardest part for us is that it's really, um, you know, budgeting and some extra things, you know, that are more, you know, nonessential items.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  i, i would say that in the situation that it is now it's more important to have the time to, to deal with that budgeting,  as far as, uh.
B:	yeah. yeah. uh-huh.
M:	but, um.
B:	on your friends, that's true, that's true. well, we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with, we both have older cars and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars, you know, on the car in two months or something,
M:	right. right.
B:	and, you know, a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for. and, uh,
M:	well, that, that is a big one. i, i think that, uh you know, you can have a good career and, and, uh and, i know that a lot, a good portion of the people that i work with, uh...
B:	yeah, kind of put in a certain amount per year, *82 and 84 same utt?
M:	right.
B:	you're going to have on extra expenses for car.
M:	right, right.
B:	yeah, yeah.
M:	so, it's not a real, it isn't a real big problem. i mean, it, it is something that i have noticed, uh, that i notice in the last couple of years, uh.
B:	yeah our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions, um, you know, is to, let's see, now, i forget which way we do it. we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back, you know, at the end of the year,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, that's not a good way to
M:	no, that isn't a good idea.
B:	that's what my husband said, so this last year he changed it, of course, we didn't get hardly and then nearly as much back and it was like oh, no. better find another way of saving money
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but,
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah, because we don't miss it, we really don't, when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff, so. but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision the, uh, expenses for college already, you know, eighteen years away or whatever.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	gosh.
M:	and, uh they're, they're doing this in the fall. it's just for those interested in it.
B:	i guess,
M:	it's just not, it's not,
B:	that's fantastic. yeah
M:	and i'm sure that she's,  i'm hoping that she'll,  she'll get around to it.
B:	well, i enjoyed talking to you too, good luck and don't spend any money this weekend
M:	!!!% okay, well, thanks a lot.
B:	oh, boy.
M:	okay, bye-bye.
B:	bye.
