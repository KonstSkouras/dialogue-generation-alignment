B:	you want to buy american.
M:	yeah, i'm not sure if i want to do that or not.
B:	um.
M:	and i like that. but, uh.
B:	it terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	what about mustang g t
M:	!!! remind me!!clamation!!
B:	those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
M:	yeah. yeah.
B:	right. well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.
M:	that's right, that's right.
B:	right, would you use that for city driving and racing?
M:	well, i would.
B:	autocrossing is, what kind of track is that?
M:	uh, well, it, it is a trials type of thing. it's, uh, you race the ball.
B:	okay. and you put up, set up the track, pylons. okay.
M:	and then you have to go up the piers and all that stuff.
B:	oh, really?
M:	and, uh-huh.
B:	yeah, i would guess so.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh, i think i'd like to get, uh, b m w or if i go the german route, which i'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, i mean, a, a acura legend. uh
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	a lexus, uh, s c three hundred maybe. something on that order.
M:	yeah.
B:	you know, because your b m w your german cars have good reputations, i think.
M:	yeah, well, they do, uh-havings for, uh you know, for different companies, and i think that's what i'd really like to have.
B:	yes.
M:	and, uh.
B:	the, yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, i mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
M:	yeah.
B:	i mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	oh, really?
M:	yeah, it, it really was.
B:	um.
M:	!!!%!!!,!!!'!!that!!;!!you!!we!!okay!!and, uh  they're, they're really nice cars.

M:	so it's really not a quality, i mean, i, i don't know, i guess, i'm not a big lewis fan, but, i wouldn't buy a lewis, uh
B:	no, it's not realistic.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, i guess, uh
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah, just work, short trips. no no heavy mileage. i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
M:	wow.
B:	so it's pretty minimal.
M:	yeah.
B:	lasts a long time. that's mainly what i'm looking for.
M:	yeah, well, i've got, i have a, uh, i don't know, probably five or six cars total that i'm going to use right now.
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	the mercedes certainly are nice.
B:	but, but if, if you have a problem with a mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, i think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
M:	yeah, yeah, that's true.
