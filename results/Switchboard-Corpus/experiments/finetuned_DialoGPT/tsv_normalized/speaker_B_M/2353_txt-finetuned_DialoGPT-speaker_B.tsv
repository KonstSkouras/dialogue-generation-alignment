B:	and i think they're better people because of it
M:	uh yeah.
B:	they're much more responsible. i know um the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know
M:	oh yeah.
B:	they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our society better.
M:	uh i don't know if that's true or not.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i was very comfortable with the kids and uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i've always felt that uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh it's it is interesting that uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh i don't know it's just that i don i think it's it seems to me that uh you know in general the the news is sensationalized and and i don'y know why. i think sometimes it's not.
B:	huh.
M:	but i think i'm going to have to do that.
B:	yeah.
M:	so i'm you you're not going to have any money left over when you retire you'll have to pay them off
B:	huh. and rattling in
M:	yeah it says anywhere from six months to two years and that's what they look for.
B:	yes. yes.
M:	i think that's a wonderful idea. um i'm i work in the waco area and um we're planning to move there in the next couple of years
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and he said that they were going to rebuild the whole thing. and i was like no no.
B:	uh-huh. well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um there's kind of a selfishness
M:	uh yeah.
B:	i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that
M:	yeah.
B:	and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um thinking less of your own needs but of other people.
M:	uh i would agree with that. uh and i think i mean i i don't know i guess i'm a little too old fashioned but i don i i don 't mind when i go out and do things myself i just don't like to have to mess with it you know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so you don't have to be you can't be self-employed and not have a budget you have to have some kind of budget and i think it's really important to be able to do things like this.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and it was like the only thing that i ever taught was assembly
B:	oh no.
M:	and um.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they were just playing board games and this and that you you would see them all in the same room you never could decide which one you wanted to play on.
B:	right. uh-huh.
M:	um you you see i don't know. i think that maybe the schools could do a better job of teaching the kids in the region you're right.
B:	yes.
M:	i think i don't know i'm sure that uh a lot of things we have to solve are not solutions to the problem.
B:	it would really um and i don't the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend
M:	uh
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	and um you know although i wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them
M:	uh-hums.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature than the average student
M:	yeah.
B:	and like she's washing
M:	uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i think they did a really good job of that.
B:	well that's right. a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just get so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that that we really don't want our young people to be doing
M:	uh uh-hue.
B:	and
M:	yeah.
B:	um.
M:	well i i don't know i guess it's a matter of uh of of different priorities i suppose.
B:	yeah. uh-huh.
M:	but uh you can you could say you're probably right that that the uh the government's probably not doing itself any good and that there's probably other problems that uh
B:	because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and um having people like
M:	uh-hue.
B:	but you know our like in our church it it is your free to do that or not
M:	uh.
B:	you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and of course we think it's helping other people.
M:	uh yeah i think it is.
B:	and so
M:	i think it and i think and it's sad because you see so many young people that are in trouble and so many people that you don't even know it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i think that it's a big problem.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	!!!!!!;!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	and they're preoccupied with drinking.
M:	right and they're they're in a in a mental institution.
B:	uh-huh. and
M:	yeah and uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh  i think it's it's interesting that that uh...
B:	that's true. paper
M:	uh but i uh.
B:	that's really true.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah. well i i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um
M:	uh i know uh uh i my my sister-in-law is a uh a a vietnam veteran and she was in the uh and it i guess it was the the theater or whatever uh.
B:	oh really.
M:	and uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with what my what i was going to study
M:	uh-uh. uh-hue.
B:	and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer. why? because they make a lot of money.
M:	right.
B:	and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
M:	that's true that is true. i don't know what they call it in college. i think they call themselves institutions of like thirty or forty thousand or something like that.
B:	they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
M:	that's true that is true. that's true and and uh you know i think uh and that's also true of uh you know a lot a whole lot of companies you're right a a large percentage of people that are hired are you get uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're all
B:	yes.
M:	i mean i don't know it it seems ridiculous. i mean you know what's the solution.
B:	there's just too many people. uh-huh. that's right. not enough people want to do that to for uh because of a service that they could provide.
M:	uh-uh. yeah. i think it's it's a shame that there's so many people who are uninsured and can't afford to get a to get treatment and to be able to get help.
B:	you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and and you know it's not just the money that's available it is the principle.
B:	that's kind of sad. well anyway.
M:	okay.
B:	well i guess i better go.
M:	okay.
B:	well good luck to you. i enjoyed it.
M:	all right.
B:	thanks. bye-bye.
