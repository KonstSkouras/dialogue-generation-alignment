M:	well, that's, that, that would be good.
B:	yeah, yeah. i think that it probably would be a, a good program. i think probably two years is too long.
M:	oh, yeah, i agree.
B:	i think maybe a year would be, the longest.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, i don't think that they're going to be serving anybody.
M:	right.
B:	yeah. so i think it would be a good thing though, to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing. to get out there and do so.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. right.
M:	but i think there's, you, you have to have some sort, of a commitment to do that.
B:	right. college credit is a good idea because,
M:	i mean, i'm not, i don't know.
B:	right.
M:	but,
B:	that's right yeah, they probably couldn't do anything monetary, but i think, giving, giving some kind of college credit,
M:	yeah.
B:	no, i don't think so either because a lot of people, um, depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not that familiar with them to know,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but, you know, if, a, a lot of people flat can't afford to.
M:	right.
B:	you know,
M:	well, that's true.
B:	and most kids these days have gotten themselves into, uh, financial situations, where they have to be working all the time.
M:	yeah.
B:	so, it's, it's a really tough question. that's right.
M:	it's a tough question, and i think it's really important that we do, we try to encourage them to go into a better world where they can have a happy life,
B:	yeah,
M:	i mean, i think it's really important that they do, uh.
B:	and, if you put them in public service right out of high school, then that, that postpones their college, for a year
M:	yeah.
B:	and that would upset a lot of people too, because they just want to get on,
M:	uh-hue.
B:	yeah. i, you know, i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program,
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	but i, i think it can't be something that's mandatory.
M:	right.
B:	it has to be something that's voluntary. you know, which is pretty much the way it is now. they might,
M:	yeah, i know. i think that's, that's the way they're thinking. i mean, you can't, you don't have to do anything.
B:	yeah, and that's the other thing is that, you know, instead of making it mandatory, they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better. and, uh, you know, go to the schools and do programs, and tell them that we need your help, and, you know, uh, volunteer for such and such a time,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and you've a choice of where you want to go.
M:	right.
B:	and, and that way, handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it.
M:	right.
B:	yeah, in their own community, right. yeah, that's true most of them probably wouldn't do something like that. although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but, they would have to be supported in some way, and i'm not sure that those programs are available to do that.
M:	i know, i don't know, you're right, i, i think they should have a, a little more, uh, information on that and then we could start talking about it,
B:	right.
M:	i mean, i don't know.
B:	right, exactly.
M:	!!!%!! line!!action!! reminders!! command!! commands!! auto!! this!!
B:	yeah, it is tough. it's, and i don't know who's even proposing it, or, or how they plan on implementing it, if they do.
M:	well, i think it's just a matter of, you have to decide what you want to do. if you want, you want your child to be taken care of while you're at work. if, if, if you want her to be, you, you can leave her at home.
B:	yeah. yeah. i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them.
M:	!!!%!! remind me that.
B:	you know, it be, it wouldn't take up much, much, it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money.
M:	oh, that's true. that's true, that would be true.
B:	they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that.
M:	right.
B:	you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience, get them all in the auditorium,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and you, you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, i think, that they could get some results from that, because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded,
M:	right.
B:	but they don't know where to go to, to, to do anything.
M:	right, yeah.
B:	yeah, it is. it really is.
M:	and, and i don't, i don, i mean, i, i'm, i guess i'm kind of an arlingtonite, too, you know, because i'm originally from plano, and so i've lived here forever,
B:	right.
M:	and, you're right, they, they're really trying to start people off on a different level.
B:	yeah, yeah.
M:	and i think that, you see, you're beginning to see more and more of that on young people.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, i, i don't know, i think it's kind of a sad situation. i don, i really do. i think that, uh, you, you need to look at what, uh what the, what the united states has done in the past with regards to, you do see about these things?
B:	i don't either that's one,
M:	i mean, you hear a lot about, uh, funding things like aids research and, you, you think that's, that's funded, you're right, but i don t understand, uh.
B:	yeah, it is a tough question.
M:	but, uh, i think that's the best answer.
B:	sure, same here.
M:	bye-bye.
B:	you too.
M:	bye-bye.
B:	bye.
