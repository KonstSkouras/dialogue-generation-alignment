M:	so, that's good.
B:	yeah.
M:	that's neat, you know, so, you don't have to do anything.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's kind of nice because i'm not, i don't have to mess with it, you know,
B:	uh-huh. oh, well, good. well, i, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends i, you know, obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when i was growing up.
M:	right.
B:	i, i, i grew up on a farm, uh, in iowa, and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. and then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me and i, i helped out with it. but, uh, although i have brought my boys into to see where i work, it's not that easy, and it's, it's certainly not at all common, and they, they just don't really have that same idea,
M:	uh,
B:	so they, uh, it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah. yeah. well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah, i've been lucky in that respect that i don't, uh, don't travel too much .
M:	uh-huh.
B:	oh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i'm sure he's missed a lot of, um,  the social changes that have occurred in the last, um.
B:	yes.
M:	but, uh, i think, uh i think they're doing a lot of research and, uh and, and, you know, getting a lot more involved.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh,
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	but, uh, you're right, you can't just do that every day.
B:	yeah. yeah, right.
M:	i know it.
