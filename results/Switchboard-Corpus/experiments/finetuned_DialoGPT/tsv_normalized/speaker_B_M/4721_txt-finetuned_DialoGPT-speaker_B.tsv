M:	oh, yeah, yeah it does.
B:	i, i've, one thing, when, when i have run and jogged, uh, i've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that i was having to do, i, i've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, i write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. the, it's
M:	yeah i,
B:	the the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
