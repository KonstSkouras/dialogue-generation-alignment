B:	so, i own a home in pensacola, and, uh, let's see, we are to compare homes. correct?
M:	yes.
B:	uh, my home is, well, is typical for the area. i live in a development, uh, it's a relatively, i would say, well, god, it sounds like, sounds like i'm bragging
M:	!!!;!!%!! remindme!!ets!!eting!!
B:	but it's upper middle class, uh, kind of an environment.
M:	right. right.
B:	it's a two story colonial, which my wife and i designed.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, it has around thirty-two hundred square feet. uh, five bedrooms and so forth and so on,
M:	oh.
B:	and it is, i would imagine in terms of, of size and so forth, it's relatively typical for the area. it might be, i would say it's probably midsized for the area. there are some smaller, and there are, you know, several larger.
M:	um.
B:	and, uh, but based, you know, in terms of, you know, in, in pensacola, in that area of florida it, uh, it's what now, it is, uh, probably ten years old.
M:	oh, wow.
B:	yeah.
M:	it's, it, it has been there for a long time.
B:	and so it's, in terms of cost and, and, and size and so forth, it, uh, the you know, housing there is extremely affordable, and, uh, compared to other parts of the country, you know, let's say compared to maryland that same house here would probably cost three-quarters of a million dollars
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but,
M:	and, and that's, that's the way i feel about it. i mean, i, i think it's a good thing, i mean it's good that they're trying, but it's just like, i don't know, i guess, you can't make it, you have to make it.
B:	i really haven't, i really haven't, uh, when we built it ten years ago, it was, it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars.
M:	oh.
B:	so, i, i would have really, i haven't really priced, you know, in the market, so i,
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, and it would have been a lot bigger.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and the cost of living here is just astronomical compared to where i am
B:	i thought that was on the upswing again now.
M:	uh, yeah, i mean, it is.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	uh, i, i think we have gone backwards.
B:	yes.
M:	and there's, there's a lot of companies that have, that have done a lot better.
B:	uh-huh
M:	um.
B:	well, pensacola has it's really is a buyer's market there now
M:	uh, yeah.
B:	and it isn't because of the, well, there has been a lot of speculative building. uh, i don't know, perhaps not in dallas,
M:	uh-uh.
B:	but, uh, i'm sure people in, uh, you know, in, uh, galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it, uh, pensacola is a navy town.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and home porting was a possibility a few years ago.
M:	right.
B:	they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy,
M:	uh, uh-hue.
B:	a new carrier was coming in and, uh, the, uh, attendant, uh, support vessels. well, that's no longer, the case.
M:	right.
B:	oh, it's, it is. i mean, the, the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and so overbuilding is, has been a real problem there.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so you can still get a, get a, a good house for a very, very reasonable price. and i mean good, i would, let's say typical, say three bedroom, uh, two and a half baths, on a half acre or so of land uh, reasonable construction would probably run you, uh, right now anywhere between, somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars. and probably, perhaps, cheaper, depending upon the neighborhood.
M:	yeah.
B:	what about your home?
M:	well, it's, it, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's, it's, uh it's an older home and it's not, it, it used to be a little more expensive, but we, we're still, we still have about a hundred square feet and it is still pretty much an old house.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's, uh, it's got, uh uh, uh a den, on the side and, uh it's completely brick, and it's the only thing that we don't like about it is the privacy of the den.
B:	nor do we, but,
M:	but, uh, we, we've got two bedrooms and, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that house.
B:	right.
M:	and, and they were all the same,
B:	well, the housing here in maryland is just atrocious. and in, in the entire d c area. i'm, i'm only about, uh, twelve miles or so from the, uh, border of washington d c, and montgomery county, maryland is probably one of the most expensive, places to,
M:	uh-uh. right.
B:	no, we are west.
M:	!!!!,!!etwork!!%!!eting!!ety!!okay, you sound like you're from the east.
B:	sevren is east, near the eastern shore,
M:	okay, yeah.
B:	if i had,
M:	if i had a boat, what would i do with it?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it's, it was very, very expensive.
B:	oh, that's not unusual, yeah.
M:	and it's, it's a nice area.
B:	well, that's, that area over there is not as expensive as in the, the immediate, you know, washington area.
M:	uh-uh. right.
B:	and so, we, uh, i was just looking, for example there is a, uh, condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live, and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium. and ninety-two thousand dollars for a two bedroom, which is essentially a two bedroom apartment.
M:	oh, yeah, that is pretty expensive.
B:	now, it was very nicely done.
M:	well, it sounds like you're, you're very, very well versed on the subject.
B:	i would have thought ,
M:	it was, it's beautiful.
B:	yes. i, i can't, i can't envision spending that much money, and on, on something along those lines.
M:	well, that's true.
B:	so, you know, it's, i guess you pay the piper but, plus the, the, the taxes around here are phenomenally, high.
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	uh, for the, and so, you, on that it's not unusual, for example, for somewhere around here on a, on a, on a, what we would, you know, what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say, for example, in pensacola, florida, on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on, might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes. maybe, you know, maybe a little bit higher than that now,
M:	right, yeah, that's true.
B:	but that same house here, you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year, taxes on it.
M:	wow, that's not bad.
B:	so, it's, uh, so, the question of whether to buy here or move to another county, say, drive twenty more miles north, buy a condominium for approximately, uh, the same price, maybe a little lower, but the taxes would be, you know, perhaps, maybe one-third uh, of,
M:	yeah, that would be a, a good way to, uh
B:	oh, absolutely. yeah,
M:	oh.
B:	so, it's, it's really sad
M:	yeah, it is, it really is.
B:	this is one, this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country.
M:	yeah, i, i know.
B:	well, they it, the, their, they do have an extremely good, such things as extremely good school systems, for example. it has one of the best school systems in the country.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, and because the cost of living around here is so high,
M:	!!! remind me.
B:	public employees make great salaries around here
M:	oh, i, i agree.
B:	i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the, montgomery county public schools makes, and i'm not, this is, uh, the figure, he makes eighty thousand dollars a year.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	that's,
M:	that doesn't sound like a lot of money.
B:	and i, by administrator i, i think i mean, i, they didn't, they did not define it, but for example, a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone, you know, in that, uh, in that range.
