B:	well, how does this grab you? how did this grab you? uh, this, i, i mean, i'm, i'm a lady, but this, i heard this on a christian program and it was, uh, about the n e a and, that's the national endowment for arts, and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and then it just frosts me terribly.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	absolutely.
M:	and that, that, uh
B:	i believe that's true, yes.
M:	and i think that, uh...
B:	that's correct.
M:	you know, and i think that's going to lead to a lot of problems.
B:	heavy involvement from the public.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh. yeah, heavy involvement from the public.
M:	right, right.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know.
B:	absolutely.
M:	and, uh.
B:	no, it is not. it's lopsided, very much so.
M:	and i think that, uh.
B:	uh-huh, that's right, they pull the strings.
M:	right.
B:	right, the, yeah
M:	and they can be used to, you know, to great effect.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  and it will, uh
B:	i'm sure they will.
M:	yeah, and, uh.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but it's, it's hard to imagine that, uh, one person controlling all of this would have any affect at all.
B:	yes, i understand that, but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
M:	well, i don tinker around with it too much.
B:	oh, absolutely.
M:	and, uh, i'm not sure that we're, we're going to, uh.
B:	right, absolutely.
M:	but i think that the, the media, you hear so much, you get so fed up with it that you want to turn it off.
B:	we only see the tip of the iceberg only.
M:	that's right.
B:	you know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, uh, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.
M:	yeah, it's true.
