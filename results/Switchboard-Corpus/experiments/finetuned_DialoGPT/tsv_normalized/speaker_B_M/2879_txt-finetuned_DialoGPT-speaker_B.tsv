B:	yeah i i new york does not
M:	no i think you have to pay for that in new york state.
B:	but uh they're they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that uh the democrat that he is  and mario cuomo
M:	!!!;!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
M:	yeah well that's good i mean they they've got a lot of power.
B:	i'd i would agree with that even more i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended  by the thought that i have to support  uh just the existence of you know murder rapist  you know  right that uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill  them whatever that society has to pay uh upwards  uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
M:	uh right.
B:	right.
M:	and they're being they they are being uh
B:	i i don't know
M:	i mean i i think it's a social disease that people have.
B:	it's a hard question you look at the united states we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh
M:	yeah.
B:	or uh
M:	right. and it's not just the number of people that are killed but also the number that are in prison.
B:	here in new york it's a lot harder than that uh
M:	yeah.
B:	it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state.
M:	yeah i i think that's that is a good thing. i uh.
B:	now the the and that's with uh you have to have uh oh a police investigation you have to  have references
M:	yeah.
B:	and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh
M:	oh that would be neat.
B:	and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know there's no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that  which aren't the i i don't consider to be the kind of crime uh  weapon you know
M:	right. right.
B:	uh so
M:	yeah and uh.
B:	right.
M:	and they were you you'd be the kid that got beat up by the guy you were the kid who got beat to death.
B:	right.
M:	and uh.
B:	yeah yeah
M:	and you know it's it's a big deal that way you don't know
B:	well and the thing with bundy was though he escaped
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and then
M:	i think it was it was a uh a the the guy that held him out of the jail uh-huh was uh.
B:	yeah
M:	yeah.
B:	and did it again and uh
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	no.
M:	but he was the only
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and he was he was sentenced to death and and the the sentence was given uh-hundred years but they changed it to uh.
B:	oh god.
M:	and uh.
B:	great.
M:	and and then they put her in a rest home.
B:	surely  there's and end to the situation.
M:	it seems that  that there's a lot of anger  because people say you you're welcome to go.
B:	right.
M:	and and uh and i think that's that's the way that the justice system works and i i think it's going to be addressed in the courts but it's not going to change over the next ten or fifteen years you you're going to have to change that aspect of it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i don tinker with that at all.
B:	right.
M:	but uh.
B:	rome new york it's up state it it's uh near syracuse
M:	!!!!!!iful!! my little boy just got in kindergarten and i was just thinking you know that's great that they're starting kindergarten next year.
B:	it's about uh well i i actually live in a village of sylvan beach i work in rome uh
M:	oh yeah uh-huh.
B:	it's more rural
M:	i'm in i'm in plano so.
B:	uh it use to be use to be a uh uh have a lot of heavy industry
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south
M:	right.
B:	and uh now the air force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh uh  so it's   not too bad
M:	yeah.
B:	it you know you still have the uh more drug problems and typical  uh small city type problems
M:	yeah.
B:	but i don't know that there's a real uh
M:	yeah.
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
M:	oh i agree. uh
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	they they go out and kill the person you can't do that
B:	right.
M:	and it's like you just don't you don't see you can't see what they're doing.
B:	i think i think pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i'm from uh  from pennsylvania also just uh just outside  of philadelphia
M:	uh-uh. oh uh-h.
B:	yeah.
M:	but i mean i've been there like i was in like the second grade and then i went to college
B:	right.
M:	and uh.
B:	the west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so.
M:	oh that's that is a that would be a really scary thought.
B:	right.
M:	i i guess i have a hard time with that.
B:	right.
M:	and it's not that we have to be a little bit romanesque about it
B:	sure.
M:	if they had a chance to do something they would say that they were very very creative and
B:	yeah
M:	but it's not like it's going to happen to everybody.
B:	if your friends or family got uh had that happen to them i think everyone would i they'd  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face  as they did it.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue. yeah. yeah yeah i think  i think that would be the best thing to do.
B:	yeah. right.
M:	and uh  that was a big factor in my decision.
B:	right. right.
M:	but you would want to know you wouldn tinker with it. i mean i think that's the whole point of the trial by jury.
B:	well uh i uh yeah i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty  pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	oh yeah an injection
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah that would be even yeah i didn't even think about that.
M:	yeah.
B:	i think
M:	but i think i think in the in in texas they have it.
B:	yeah there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like uh massachusetts went back  and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books.
M:	oh really.
B:	right.
