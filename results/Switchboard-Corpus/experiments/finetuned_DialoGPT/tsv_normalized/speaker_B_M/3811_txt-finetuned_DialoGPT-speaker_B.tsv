B:	oh boy.
M:	yeah so he's a little bit young for a kindergartner.
B:	yeah.
M:	we have a seven year old and a three year old.
B:	are you? where are a student?
M:	uh university of rochester.
B:	no kidding.
M:	yeah so that's a real change.
B:	i was a professor in a university here in california for a while.
M:	oh really?
B:	yeah uh are you going to uh put your son in child care in a a year or two?
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and so that's going away.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh so we we have uh
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and what we found uh to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were going to be loving
M:	uh.
B:	and uh that's more important than anything else. we could have sent uh her to a fancier uh facility.
M:	right.
B:	uh she goes to a home. this is a uh a couple uh emigrated from china early in in their lives.
M:	huh.
B:	they've been here probably thirty forty years.
M:	thirty years?
B:	they've got three daughters. uh and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
M:	oh.
B:	and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends
M:	uh.
B:	so it's a good experience.
M:	yeah i've never had to leave my kids at home without them
B:	i if it's good i think it's very good for the child.
M:	yeah i i agree with you there.
B:	and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it. she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
M:	yeah.
B:	but uh we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace. i don't know what it's like around uh hattiesburg.
M:	!!!;!! remind me of that.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	yeah. i'll bet they're involved. yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	yeah
M:	so uh.
B:	well that's uh i know it's it's a real hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	out here at manford they have a you know a a a real good facility and there uh is quite a waiting list to get into that.
M:	oh i see.
B:	so it's uh uh you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
M:	uh.
B:	and i think this is really  is buyer beware.  well it is the best way  to do it interestingly.
M:	that's right.
B:	i think that uh my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that uh private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	because i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. as a matter of fact my future is banked on that uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching sesame street and in child care.
M:	right. right. right right.
B:	primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
M:	right. right.
B:	it's it's phenomenal. it's phenomenal the programming the human operating system
