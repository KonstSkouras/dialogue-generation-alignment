B:	i kind of i think so too. i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it's it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i think uh.
B:	your right i do too i think they start out young like in uh girl scouts and boy scouts a video doing
M:	uh-huh.
B:	right that's see that's what we did in girl scouts and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	something
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	yeah.
M:	you know i mean it's not just that it you know it needs to be more of a a regular thing for everybody.
B:	i do too. i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that. and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know helping helping out. i think that's good and
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	yeah yeah.
M:	if they give five percent we'd solve all our problems.
B:	yeah there you go.
M:	it's a good point.
B:	right.
M:	yeah my kids i don't know maybe they were just not exposed to the metric system that much.
B:	yeah it sounds pretty good that sounds good. i've noticed a lot of uh different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat. they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and they clean it up.
M:	uh that's good.
B:	and keep it clean. i think that's i pretty good idea. and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older. i know i did you know in girl scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
M:	uh that's neat.
B:	so oh.
M:	!!!%!! translated!! translate!! remind me of that
B:	yeah i'm in texas. where are you at?
M:	i'm in dallas.
B:	new york.
M:	oh really?
B:	oh gosh.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	so i guess we're going to see a lot of snow.
B:	yeah
M:	i think i think it's going to be a long way though.
B:	uh-huh. oh no.
M:	so i mean it's really bad.
B:	oh.
M:	and it was really uh.
B:	golly.
M:	but we had power. we had four h p m here in mckinney.
B:	are you serious?
M:	i mean you could just as easily imagine that they had had uh a revolution.
B:	oh my god how do they live?
M:	i don't know i i mean i don't i know how they live but uh it just seems like they they don't really have any power. i mean they just sort of they vote and uh.
B:	yeah. i haven't heard a thing.
M:	but i know that there's been talk about building more prisons.
B:	lord.
M:	and uh we've we were in the process of filling in some forms for our uh  state.
B:	well that's good. that's great.
M:	so it's it is a real change.
B:	right. yeah.
M:	and and it's it's a real problem.
B:	right.
M:	but uh they do they have the facilities to do it.
B:	and we go along and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat. i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh yeah. they uh luckily we have a a man who owns a building company.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material. then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
M:	right.
B:	yeah. and it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so it's real neat.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	it's   yeah
M:	and it's it's like uh
B:	it's  like i say it's not a lot but it helps people. like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and i just you know just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
M:	yeah.
B:	and you know if you can do any a little bit it helps so
M:	oh i know. i know i do it too. i just can't seem to get over the fact that i need to do it. i don't know why i don trenches. i do all the other stuff.
B:	yeah.
M:	that helps a lot.
B:	yeah.
M:	and other ones did you you just had to meet people
B:	gosh. that's great. that's a lot.
M:	so i i think i mean i'm not sure you you're right that the that there is a great deal of responsibility and i think that you can see where that comes in handy.
B:	that's that's a lot of kids though.
M:	yeah. i i know i think that's the only thing i can think of that's uh.
B:	oh well still that's a you know that's a good chunk of kids.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	and and and it was just you you knew you were going to get into a class that was going to be about the same as theirs.
B:	yeah. that's neat.
M:	so that was kind of neat. i i uh.
B:	that's great.
M:	so
B:	that's great. but uh like i'll agree with you though i don't think they should have to do a year
M:	no i i agree with that.
B:	yeah. i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean. they're not worth it
M:	yeah
B:	right. oh yeah that's true that's true.
M:	and uh.
B:	oh.
M:	and she works in the same kind of station with t v you don't hear about them.
B:	i couldn't either.
M:	but uh.
B:	i couldn't either.
M:	oh i was just thinking that's what that's the only thing i can really think of that would really be a crime you wouldn't know anything about it
B:	right right.
M:	and i think the the and i think that the i think they have a very i don't know i i'm not really sure what the what the quality of the of the products they put out are you're you have to wonder you can't you don't just can't tell.
B:	yeah. i just know one person that's in the peace corps and i mean she's a teacher and and just wanted to do it. she'd been a teacher for a while. just decided she wanted to do it so. i mean i'm grateful for people like that but i don't see how they can just yeah
M:	i don't either i think there's so much pressure i just i guess you just have to accept that there's a limit on on what you can do.
B:	just pick up and head on out.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i wish i could do something like that but i can't so
M:	well i think i've always considered it a hobby.
B:	right that's the way i am. i know the feeling.
M:	but uh it's a lot of work i mean i'm not into sitting around and taping up the whole day you know.
B:	that's right we're against it that's right.
M:	yeah.
B:	you too and i hope everything works out up there.
M:	okay.
B:	yeah.
M:	we're just we just want to make it through this month
B:	good good that's great. yeah. well good luck.
