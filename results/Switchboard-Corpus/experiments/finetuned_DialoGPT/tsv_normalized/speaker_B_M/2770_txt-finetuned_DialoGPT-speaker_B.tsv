B:	yeah.
M:	and um you're right they're really um.
B:	no it was an kind of indoor outdoor it it was
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of the litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when .
M:	oh really?
B:	yeah i i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm kind of like big big dogs and you have to have room for them.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do. cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and things like that.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh.
B:	yeah i got to take care of a friend of mine's dog. he's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it was go over there and clean up after the dog
M:	oh gosh.
B:	and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work.
M:	yeah. yeah i know.
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh
B:	well if you're if you're going to have a pet  and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and and i think you know
M:	well i i think you're right there.
B:	when i was growing up we had cats and you know just seeing the cats you know the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand
M:	right.
B:	and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't want to you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know
M:	right.
B:	they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them.
M:	yeah it's it really is.
B:	so.
M:	well i'm i i grew up in nebraska and uh you probably heard about that
B:	yeah.
M:	and i think that's because you know we have to we're so conscious of of uh of ourselves as a whole of this sort of thing.
B:	okay
M:	okay.
B:	bye.
