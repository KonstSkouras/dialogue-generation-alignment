B:	it is. have you been living there very long?
M:	yes.
B:	so you've been there longer. we built this one about, uh, it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
M:	yeah. i remember my parents, uh.
B:	and we subcontracted it out ourselves. we bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
M:	uh.
B:	and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little over six years now. and uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
M:	uh, are you a, are, are your, uh...
B:	my husband got his big garage. he we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
M:	uh.
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and, so he has all the work space he needs.
M:	yeah.
B:	he,
M:	and, uh,
B:	it is, and that's why we decided to build. we looked at things that were already, uh, built
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
M:	uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	so we put a three car garage in.
M:	yeah.
B:	but, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. all of it was taken up with just car space.
M:	yeah.
B:	and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
M:	oh, wow.
B:	well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
M:	yeah, my husband and i have, well, we both have a big family, but i think my husband is more into the sewing and the garage work.
B:	oh, i see.
M:	so,
B:	uh-huh. well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
M:	no, it's in his, um, his garden, and, and he has plants, and trees, and his, my sister has trees, so, but i don't have any, so i'm not really out of the gardening business.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i, i do like to have my eyes open and listen to music and, uh,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they would come in and tell me how to do it and i'd be like, no, this isn't really very good.
B:	right.
M:	and, uh, they were selling it and, uh they were going to sell it to me for seventy-five,
B:	well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
M:	uh-oh.
B:	and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
M:	uh.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
M:	well, that's true.
B:	right. oh, i understand
M:	so, it's been a real good couple of years for that.
B:	well, we, that's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
M:	that's true.
B:	well, i i haven't reached that point yet. i've heard people say that. but, uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
M:	oh, that's great.
B:	he's out of college and has a good job,
M:	yeah.
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
M:	oh, that's wonderful.
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while, but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
M:	uh, that's good.
B:	that's what she plans to do.
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	so, i hope so.
M:	yeah, i'm sure it will.
B:	oh, ho-ho.
M:	and, uh, we were real lucky because my husband had, you know, the extended family, you could have a reunion there.
B:	a whole new world. uh-huh.
M:	yeah, so that's a good thing to do.
B:	i can understand.
M:	but, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	i like to, uh, catch the news on the way to work.
B:	well, that's the same thing that i did. i hope i'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
M:	oh, i do too.
B:	um, uh-huh
M:	but, uh,
B:	well, we have,
