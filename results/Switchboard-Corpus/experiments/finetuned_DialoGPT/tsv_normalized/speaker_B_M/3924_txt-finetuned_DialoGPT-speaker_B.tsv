M:	and uh i i don't know i just i do believe in funding aids research and i think it's really a shame that we don't have the support that we have.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they have aids research and and they are saying that they have a real problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh they had a a very uh...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so they had to come in and they had this machine that does it for them.
B:	huh.
M:	but i don't think they're really telling us enough.
B:	yeah. i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um uh well it is very frightening and scary. i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases and uh i mean whether
M:	well you don't have any of the other diseases that we do.
B:	yes.
M:	or or or what it really means is that uh.
B:	and uh whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh
M:	and that's that's a that was a big leap for me. i didn't know that diseases were that deadly.
B:	didn't uh you know but i uh then part of it's lack of education. i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent.
M:	uh well i think it's it's more of a a social disease than a you see in some of the older sixties or seventies you would think.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh
B:	and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh i'm concerned about uh two things. one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness.
M:	right.
B:	and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion.
M:	i think i think the the uh the you know the medical care the quality of doctors is questionable.
B:	but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah well you know
M:	and i don i don'e i think that's right.
B:	t- whether my dentist or
M:	that that that would be true.
B:	and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes. and you know they've been saying oh no absolutely not. can't get it from mosquitoes. and uh and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions yes.
M:	yeah i think that's you can get it.
B:	and i don't know that's true or not. i mean i just heard it in passing but so what does that
M:	uh i donno i haven't heard that.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
M:	right and i don i don t remember if that's in texas or not but in oklahoma it's a no smoking no smoking area.
B:	yeah.
M:	how do you feel about it?
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're not going to tell you anything that you didn't know about.
B:	no.
M:	and uh i mean i don't i i'm not saying that it's right but it's it's certainly not what it should be.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i
B:	oh.
M:	yeah.
B:	i think maybe more information should be given out about it.
M:	yeah. i think that uh we need to do something about all the drug related uh  activities that we're involved in.
B:	i i give me cyanide. i mean is it ))
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!! line!!clamation!!ety!! you!!you!!that!! that!!
