B:	oh, you like the rain, do you?
M:	um, well, not really. i just, i've been real lucky just, um, i, i'm originally from new york, and so i've lived here about two years and i've only lived here for two years so i really haven't been, you know, real experienced with it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's been up to fifty-nine, so i guess it's not too bad.
B:	oh, are you? i don't care for that as much.
M:	i, i like it, but it's just that when it's real cold i just want to go outside.

M:	oh, i,
B:	oh, really.
M:	!!!;!! remind me of that.
B:	oh, is that right?
M:	yeah.
B:	well another reason, well, i guess i can't say that it, i don't like the rain completely. we have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,
M:	uh-huh.

M:	yeah
B:	i stay in the house because it's just, it's just too hot.
M:	yeah
B:	yeah, yeah.
M:	so, i think we've really, i guess, taken a little bit of a turn in our attitudes toward that.
B:	that's okay um, i've, i've thought about that, too, and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in august sometimes so that we can be away from here
M:	uh-huh.
B:	it just really gets way, when it gets way too hot
M:	yeah, it's, it gets, uh, you know, we've been wanting to take our summer off and just spend the day with the kids, you can spend the whole week in the house,
