B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i read, uh
B:	oh.
M:	and, uh  he did that for about two years.
B:	well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science
M:	uh-oh.
B:	but beyond that, uh, lately i've been reading, i've always liked the new yorker.
M:	uh, well, i, i read that.
B:	my  wife also gets a lot of the food magazines. bon appetite, and food and wine and gourmet.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	yeah. and she still likes to get time which i've never liked very much
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	but she seems to.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	do you read a newspaper?
M:	yeah, i do. i read a lot of newspapers.
B:	yeah.  larger computer ones.
M:	but,
B:	i haven't bought it now for about eight years. but when i used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three hundred of them advertising.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	that, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.
M:	yeah.
B:	but, you know, some of the get ridiculous. travel and leisure, all of the american express magazines
M:	oh, i didn't know that.
B:	so travel and leisure, food and wine and i think they have some others, uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time?
M:	no, i haven't.
B:	but not worth it.
M:	well, that, that was a, that really was a good movie.
B:	i, i've always had this, one of the reasons i like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective.
M:	!!!%!! translated it's interesting, isn't it?
B:	so i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about, i disagree with them.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything, or, or what's going on
M:	uh, well, you know, there's a lot of things like that, you just can't put all the, all theuries in one place, you're not going to put all these people in one spot, you can't do that.
B:	so i, like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent, uh, organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective. uh, you know, their major interest is in commissions and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines. their major talk is about, you know, commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is and it gives you a different perspective on what people do.
M:	right.
B:	uh, some of them. the, the general travel magazines do.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	but i, i usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff.
M:	yeah.
B:	no.
M:	um, i guess my favorite is the new york times.
B:	yeah. i don't take much more in myself.
M:	yeah, well, i guess that's about all then.
B:	okay.
M:	we, uh, have a couple of friends that live down there.
B:	okay, nice talking to you.
