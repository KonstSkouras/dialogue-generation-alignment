M:	and she's a hundred and two.
B:	right.
M:	and, um.
B:	oh, it's very difficult i know.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	she, uh she has been a good dog to have.
B:	right.
M:	but she has, she can talk to anybody and, uh
B:	yeah.
M:	so, i guess, i, i don't know.
B:	yeah, how old is she?
M:	she's eighty-seven.
B:	uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, i don't know what i'll do up there.
M:	yeah, i, i'm sure, i mean, i know what you mean. i, uh.
B:	i, i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
M:	uh-hugs, i know,
B:	they're in missouri and i could, i, i know, i know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. most of them.
M:	uh-hue.
B:	and, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so,
M:	well, i guess that's about all i can say.
B:	right.
M:	and i think that's a really neat idea. i think there's some real potential for nursing homes and i think they've done a really good job of that.
B:	yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
M:	yeah.
B:	so, uh, i mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i would imagine that i'll, uh, if something happens, i'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, uh,
M:	well, that's good.
B:	but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but i think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
M:	yeah, i've, i, i know. i, uh i, the other thing that bothers me is, uh.
B:	but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
M:	i know.
B:	i think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
M:	yeah.
B:	they never go to see them.
M:	that's right, they don't care about anybody except themselves.
B:	i've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe christmas.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	um, i don't know, i just, i have, i've never really looked into it. i've heard horror stories.
B:	right.
M:	uh, and i'm not sure that, uh, i think the quality of nursing homes is, uh-havings compared to other types of care.
B:	oh, i do too.
M:	and, uh,
B:	or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh, because i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	so.
M:	well, i'm not real sure i, i think that the nursing home is a real good option.
B:	anyway.
M:	well, i think, i, i'm, i don't know, i guess i'm kind of mixed on the subject of drug testing. i, you know, there's a lot of things i think i think are, are very wrong.
B:	right. oh, it's tough i'm sure.
M:	yeah, it really is.
B:	oh. right, that would be devastating i'm sure so.
M:	yeah.
B:	it is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	right.
M:	and, uh, i don't know. i, i just don't think it's a very good idea.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and she said that she would not be able to take care of him. and i, i, you know, i don't think that that's right. i think that's a very, very healthy, uh  standard of living.
B:	right.
M:	but, uh.
B:	i would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
M:	well, we're, we've got a few places that are available if you want to go to the dallas location.
B:	well, anyway,
M:	well that's all right.
B:	we've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
M:	it was nice talking to you.
B:	have a good,
M:	you too.
B:	have a good
