B:	when you get one way out like that but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after. who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us. if they get some of those mega awards against them.
M:	yeah.
B:	you know they're not going to sit there and lose money. if they are losing money then they're going to raise rates.
M:	well and then they could tax people more.
B:	so it all comes filtering down to us all individually.
M:	yeah.
B:	and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged  you know.
M:	yeah.
B:	i don't know. you know some of the health insurance is written that way. you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it pre specified in the policy so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb  uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases.
M:	yeah.
B:	i think maybe you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that. i mean maybe you don't award an eighty-five year old guy the same thing that you would award a twenty-one year old.
M:	right.
B:	i i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there. and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing
M:	uh.
B:	and that can be part of continuing education maybe for judges
M:	uh yeah that's true.
B:	i don't know.
M:	well i don't i i've i grew up in a a family that uh had a lot of catholic schools and they were very very liberal and uh.
B:	you know to get into the economics of things uh because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards  it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying for get away.
M:	!!!%
B:	if it's a company you know that they're insured. unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think those should be uninsurable. i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that  that did the damage.
M:	huh i don't know.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	and
B:	for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens. one of their employees causes damage or something. sure. that's what they buy insurance for.
M:	yeah that's right.
B:	well i was just talking about any company. uh  let's just say a lumber manufacturing company
M:	uh i know i've i'm not sure if they get it or not. i know that some companies are are uh um you know you can sue for anything you want.
B:	and  uh somebody is on the premises
M:	yeah.
B:	and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures  them.
M:	oh. oh. oh no.
B:	sure. insurance should pay for that.
M:	well that's true
B:	well i'm not talking about any loss. i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due. and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a usually a lot less. but it's an an amount they're designed to sting them a little for their  negligence.   for gross wanton negligence in a claim.
M:	right. right. uh-huh. right yeah.
B:	and unfortunately the the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too.
M:	right.
B:	so again it never really penalizes  the company doing the wrong.
M:	yeah. uh-uh. well it's it really is. it's uh it it depends on what you're what you buy. uh
B:	they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to.
M:	yeah. yeah.
B:	and if if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that.
M:	yeah.
B:	then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket.
