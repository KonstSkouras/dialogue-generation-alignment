B:	and, uh. yeah, how do you feel about it?
M:	well, i, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh i don tinker with it too much. uh, i, i just think it's, it's not very good for the people who have, have to live with it.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	but i, i don't think that's right.
B:	right, exactly.
M:	you know, so i, i, you're right, you see, i don't know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't, i think that's true.
B:	right. if, if the evidence wasn't overwhelming, right?
M:	yeah, if it wasn't, if, if they didn't have the, the, uh, the peer pressure there wouldn't be that much of a problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, i mean, it, it's, it was a case of, uh, it seemed, uh-hilmable. i mean the, the, uh the evidence was, was presented so openly and, uh.
B:	well, i think that should be likewise decided by the jury, you know, because, i don't know, i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for, any reason,
M:	right.
B:	i don't know a judge might be a little more cold-blooded about it.
M:	uh, i guess it's, it's the idea that if you have a trial by jury, that, uh that if they can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty, then they have the right to, to, uh you know take their first, first, second, third, and fourth degree.
B:	yeah, i don't think we,
M:	i mean, i've been in texas and pennsylvania and, and, uh, i guess there's some, there's a lot of things that i would like to know more about.
B:	no, huh-uh. no we don't.
M:	we don't either.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh, we're, we are doing it this year, so.
B:	uh-huh. oh, yeah they're always in florida. florida and louisiana, i think, and, uh, some of the,  other southern states.
M:	yes. yeah, i've heard that.
B:	course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate.
M:	yeah. uh-hue.
B:	get that unemployment way up so then people, you know tend towards crime, and then they they start stiffening the penalties.
M:	right.
B:	well, in florida seems like, uh, two or three times a year. it's constantly on the,
M:	yeah, it's just a, it just a real problem. i mean they, they just don't do anything about it.
B:	yeah. no, that's true. course they have a requirement that, uh, that every single appeal must be permitted.
M:	right.
B:	so, of course, the, the attorneys,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	they go all the way up to the supreme court, you know.
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	they almost always get thrown right back out again, but they have to have every single appeal made open to them.
M:	right.
B:	some of these guys are really, uh, you know, violent son of sam killers and stuff like that, you know.
M:	right.
B:	i mean, they,
M:	but i think it's just,
B:	everyone knows they're going get, not going to get out.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	and they get, they go to the principal's office and, you know, and they, they just, you can't do anything.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, i, i think that's one of the reasons that, uh.
B:	i think so.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	uh, a lot of the, the, the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about. although, you know, stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole,
M:	uh-uh. uh-hue.
B:	i mean, these guys are certainly not going to, uh, be, they can't, i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison. i don't think the parole system is really helping that much
M:	uh.
B:	reduce the violence in the prisons. i think that's its only purpose is, is, you know, to reduce, uh, the violence in the prisons so people behave themselves a little bit better if they think they're going to get off early. off earlier.
M:	yeah, that's true.
B:	but some of these guys just don't care,  you know. and so, uh,
M:	yeah, that's true.
B:	yeah, right, uh-huh.
M:	and they, they, you don't know, they're just happy to get out of it.
B:	um, that's possible i guess.
M:	and, uh.
B:	um, so where do you live in pennsylvania?
M:	um pittsburgh.
B:	oh, okay. i don't think i really know that.
M:	uh, i think they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools.
B:	because, uh, you know, that all depends, too, on where you are at. that's, uh, sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are. because the more grass root country, uh, parts of the country tend to, to support capital punishment, where the places that are, you know, less in contact with crime you know, the, the more, more urban, i mean less,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh and so i'm not, i don, i think i'm pretty far from, uh you know what i call a nut and bolts kind of attitude.
B:	two hours where?
M:	uh, i live in garland.
B:	oh, okay. near polk?
M:	yeah.
B:	polk institute. it's, uh, an old, uh, university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded. uh,
M:	oh.
B:	very old, uh, historical place there.
M:	oh.
B:	sharon, pennsylvania's up there.
M:	yeah, that's where i've seen it.
B:	yeah.
M:	that's a nice area.
B:	oh, okay.
M:	okay.
B:	in that case, maybe, you know.
M:	yeah. i mean, i know that my older brother and sister-in-law, they've been in a relationship for, oh, probably twenty-five years,
B:	right. that's true. yeah, well, it, it, you know, you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have, you know, stolen kids and, you know,  done terrible things to them and killed them and, you know, that sort of thing,
M:	uh, well
B:	you just like, i don't want that person sharing the earth with me, you know, i mean, that is just terrible.
M:	uh,
B:	and, uh, you know, we had a case like that here and, on the other hand, you know, people are saying that because the, he knows, because the criminals know that the, uh, penalties can be very severe, they, uh, there's less criminals that are, you know, turning themselves in, or, you know, pleading or whatever, because they know that the judge, you know, if they find them guilty is, you know, has the, the opportunity to sentence them, you know, for, for the death sentence.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah. well, i'm just saying that, that, that's what, the, the client, lawyers are saying. they're saying that, you know, you know, more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to, to, to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain what the sentence is going to be.
M:	right.
B:	right, uh-huh.
M:	so, i don't know, i, i guess, i just, i feel that the justice system works in our favor in that we're not satisfied with the system and i think it's just that there's, there is too much, uh you know the justice systems are working in our favour.
B:	yeah, right.
M:	!!!!,!!;!! remind me of that now.
B:	uh-huh. i was just saying that way, what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then. and so, we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty.
M:	uh, i see.
B:	and perhaps we can and perhaps we can't and so the guy might get off.
M:	well, i think we have got a long way to go. i think, uh, you know, in the last ten years, uh uh, the only way that we've gone down is to, uh to having a unanimous verdict.
B:	and, uh, although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are, are guys that are, you know going to get caught anyways but, there's always a few of those people that are, you know, lost their head or whatever.
M:	right.
B:	anyways, but, uh. yeah, we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared and, and the guy, like i said, he just, uh, said that he took her, but he won't admit that she died or whatever, and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's very you know, mandatory life sentences for murder.
