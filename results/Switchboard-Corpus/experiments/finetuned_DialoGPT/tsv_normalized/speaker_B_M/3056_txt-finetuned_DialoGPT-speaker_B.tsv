B:	that was, uh, that was, it came out a couple of years ago and i have just now gotten around to reading it. i have had it a couple years, but, uh,
M:	well, i, i read a lot of books. uh, i don't read as much as i would like to, but i do read.
B:	oh, i do not remember the man's name, he was, used to be a reporter for, uh, i think, the new york times, or the washington post, one of the two, and he supposedly got this, this, story, uh, i mean this, uh, was contacted by this guy who had these, these memos he wanted to sell, and they were, they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the, uh, corporate headquarters in, uh, in los angeles.
M:	oh
B:	they, on i think it was romain drive or romain street or something, there in los angeles, they used to have a, or, i guess they still do, uh, had a, uh, uh, big warehouse kind of thing, which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a, uh, you know, for the size of the company which, inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected, he, he was, uh, a great collector of everything, he, he, he did not, he did not throw anything away and, uh, supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for he was a, like, you know, burglar, had been breaking there awhile and, uh, and had ended up,
M:	huh, i know who you're talking about.
B:	he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect, and they, uh, they broke in one, one night and found a bunch of memos that were, uh, supposedly from, from hughes to, uh, to his main, uh, main assistant back, uh, in the fifties and well, i guess, in the sixties, up until his death.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, it's pretty interesting work so,
M:	well do you, do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
B:	yeah, it's a, it's a little, it's a little hard you have to plod through it and, you know, it does not have a real story, or any plot,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on.
M:	right.
B:	no, i have not seen it. but it's, but it is, it is real interesting,
M:	yeah.
B:	uh, i also reading, uh, the, uh, it's a, an old, another old book that i happen to have. i am sort of rereading it. it's, uh, a book about, uh, the bermuda triangle, but it's, uh, it's about, it's a real good book that a guy, uh, wrote who was, uh, a research librarian, he wrote, uh, sort of debunking many of the, uh, uh, the stories about the, uh, bermuda triangle. you know, he, he was thinking many, many of the the myths, many of the myths of the triangle were, uh, actually, could be explained,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, you know. uh, and the reason i was, picked it back up was in light of all the, uh, well when they found the, uh, the airplanes on the, in the atlantic, thinking they were flight nineteen. and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's, uh, flight nineteen was one of the, uh, was a, a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two. right after world war two, and they were, they were lost and, uh,
M:	well, i guess that's about all i can think of for a while, to be honest with you.
B:	yeah, they were.
M:	and, uh.
B:	and so, and in the book, you know, even, he wrote this book back in the seventies, and even, and even then he, he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water. and, uh, because he, he mentions, he, he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth. and, uh, it's probably, you know, real close to what, you know, everyone is thinking, now that, they just got turned around and could not find their way back.
M:	well, that's true.
B:	uh, no, i have not.
M:	well, i don't know if you've ever read that book.
B:	yeah, i would i would like to, too, because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her, you know, possibilities of of where she ,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh
M:	i don't know.
B:	yeah.
M:	but it's, it's just, it, it seems like there's so much going on that you just don't, you don't even want to really think about it. you know.
B:	right.
M:	so,
B:	yeah. so, that is pretty much for right now, that is, what i have been reading.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i kind of like to read different stuff and, uh, i like to read a novel every now and then, but, uh, i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time.
M:	uh-huh.
