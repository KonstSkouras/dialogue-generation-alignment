B:	uh i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either. uh
M:	i think the judges have the final say.
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	and i think that's a really good idea. i mean i i really don't know if they should have a jury like that. i uh
B:	exactly. uh-huh. uh i don't know. i uh you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison uh falsely accused but uh more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing. uh i mean you
M:	yeah.
B:	never.
M:	i don't think i've ever served on one.
B:	huh. well you would think that they would get that in the uh when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and i i know they automatically when you go through uh when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically no they don't want you on the jury.
M:	uh-hue.
B:	exactly. uh-huh exactly. uh
M:	i mean you know i don't think that there's a whole lot that the public wants to hear about.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	it's just that you you have to be so um oh oh gosh i can't even think of the word.
B:	i've i've never i've never even been called to jury duty.
M:	uh you've never been called.
B:	yeah. i uh i don't know i think the i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
M:	uh-uh. i agree with that. i think that uh i don i'm not sure if i believe that the criminal system is perfect but uh.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	you got to kill them both ways.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh  and get a reasonable uh you know.
B:	right.
M:	but uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	they they're very very uh...
B:	i uh i i i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
M:	yeah.
B:	least with the jury you have twelve people you know that are going to decide you know
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
B:	judge
M:	yeah i well that's true.
B:	right exactly
M:	so
B:	probably yeah yeah. but uh no it's it's sad though that uh that the people though that you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
M:	right.
B:	and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
M:	yeah.
B:	exactly.
M:	so uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then you get someone who who's very ill and has serious problems and they have to go through this whole set of criteria to get them to answer the questions.
B:	oh yeah. well
M:	but i i just don't think it's it should be a unanimous decision.
B:	i guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know. if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury.
M:	yeah.
B:	but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously
M:	!!!%!! remind me!! remind me!%
B:	yeah.
M:	it would be a good thing to do.
B:	i would love to be called i'm ready to go they just haven't called me up yet
M:	oh okay.
B:	it was nice talking to you.
M:	well have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week.
B:	bye-bye.
