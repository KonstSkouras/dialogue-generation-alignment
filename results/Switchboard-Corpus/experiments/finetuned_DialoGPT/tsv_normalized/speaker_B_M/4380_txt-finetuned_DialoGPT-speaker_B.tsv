B:	and i,
M:	and what grade do you teach?
B:	okay uh, i've, the high school i went to was, uh, was a good one also. and i, well, i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools. because the one i went to was, you know, i'm sure a, a lot nicer than, you know, a lot of the inner city schools and the things around atlanta.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean, i went there as a second shift person,
B:	what
M:	!!! remind me of that now.
B:	yeah, that's true.
M:	and they were, they were motivated to do something and they were willing to try.
B:	yeah. and i'm also i mean, in the, in those places where, uh, like the economy is really bad, they might, you know, be more tempted to, to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the, you know, money to put food on the table and stuff like that. more than they would you know, in areas where they
M:	yeah
B:	uh-huh. yeah. that's true.
M:	you know, i don't know, it's just a, it seems like, it, it would be more of a challenge.
B:	right.
M:	!!!etwork!! etwork! etwe!!;!!body!! unless you work for a company,
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean, i think a lot of people are just totally, totally turned off on the test. i mean, you, you're not going to, you don't have to worry about, you can just, you could just say good-bye now and it wouldn't, you wouldn't have anything to worry, you didn't have any reason to, to be bothered.
B:	that's hard for me to say since i didn't, i didn't really grow, well when i went to elementary school it, it wasn't in a great area but i still, i mean, i learned to read, started learning to read when i was in kindergarten, you know.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so i guess i can't really i can't say what it would be like to, uh, grow up in a really oppressed region
M:	uh-huh.
B:	you know, i guess the whole, the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the people.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so, i guess the problem is the, the thing to do is to try to, uh, to get some kind of motivation to learn and,
M:	yeah, yeah, i, i've, i have a lot of friends that are teachers.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	no, i, i can't say that i have either. but, uh,
M:	i, i would like to go to a, a school that has more than one teacher.
B:	yeah. i've, i've heard some, i mean i've heard statistics and things that, that compare a public education to a private education. i mean within like, within the same, uh, income groups.
M:	uh-uh. right.
B:	if you compare the, like the people that could have, that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that, you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private  schools.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think they compare you know, fairly well.
M:	well, that's good.
B:	yeah. i, i, i, my schools, i mean, there, i have a lot of once, once it seemed i got into high school, they had a lot of, uh, accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	that, i mean, that makes a big difference cause i wondered when they're taking classes with, uh, with people that are really, are interested in the, the subject and stuff like that.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, it's, it really is, and i think that's one of the things that, that, uh,
