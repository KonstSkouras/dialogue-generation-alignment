B:	yeah, uh, i was
M:	well, you know, i, i think we're going to see a lot more recycling centers and a lot, a lot going on here in this area.
B:	my community, that's cute. i live in a place called dye mound.
M:	oh, okay.
B:	or dye community.
M:	oh, dye,
B:	and it's not a city, not incorporated, my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, i can't even see their house and, uh,
M:	uh,
B:	yeah, i mean, uh, i'm out in, i'm out in the wilderness. literally.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	and, uh, well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, i mean, to the asphalt, we're out there.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we, i do some interesting recycling things.
M:	oh, really.
B:	i'm building our house right now and i'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.
M:	oh, great.
B:	so when i drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer.
M:	right.
B:	hopefully, it's not my wife.
M:	yeah.
B:	well, i thought i'd, you know, i'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. i don't know if you're familiar with that operation, but, what you do is you just build up the pressure
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and then you go over and release it and then it just, it just drops, you know.
M:	uh, i've heard of it, but i haven't done it.
B:	very similar, yeah.
M:	yeah.
B:	well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, but you, it won't go down.
M:	oh, okay, yeah, that's what it's for.
B:	until you pull the pin, yeah.
M:	yeah.
B:	anyway i have another, uh, recycling method i use.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	you know all that junk mail you get?
M:	well, not junk mail. uh, it's, uh
B:	the glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well, anytime they send me a return envelope i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i, you know, happen to gather up.
M:	yeah.
B:	because, uh, well, like i say, we live a way and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.
M:	right.
B:	and i don't like that
M:	no.
B:	so i don't do that. so i take it and i send, and i mail it back to them.
M:	yeah.
B:	i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.
M:	oh, my goodness.
B:	yeah. well, i think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items.
M:	yeah, i've, i, i'm not real sure what the steps are to do that but i think we're going to have to do something. i, you know, i don, i really don't know what the solution is.
B:	for instance, uh, i saw a thing on, uh, nova, i think it was the other day.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	this guy has designed recyclable materials, i mean recyclable items.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.
M:	yeah.
B:	see, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.
M:	yeah.
B:	if it's metal, it's all out of metal. it's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle
M:	right.
B:	and somebody will find a way to make money at it.
M:	yeah.
B:	and,
M:	i, i'm not sure that the, the, uh.
B:	well, there is a guy in dallas, that's all he does.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	he collects trash. you know, and,
M:	well i have, uh, i have one, i don't, i mean, i do have two trash cans.
B:	yeah, well, he's, he's out for cardboard.
M:	uh-huh.
