B:	you bet.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!
B:	i'll let you lead out.
M:	all right.
B:	i'll let you lead out.
M:	well it's not mine. i just got it from a friend who was taking it for a friend and she was going to take it to a friend's and i said well i can just charge it you know.
B:	i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so if you look at russia and what's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing. and of course i look at the economic problems in the united states right now. one of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us.
M:	well that's true that that is true. i i mean i it i don't know i'm not sure if the soviet union itself is going to be better off under communism or not but what's going on in the economic situation.
B:	i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great to even have three or four different careers in your life.
M:	right.
B:	i think it must have been terribly boring to go through  your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years.
M:	yeah.
B:	some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing.
M:	right. right.
B:	and the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think it's great.
M:	yeah i think it is.
B:	oh yeah.
M:	and uh and and i'm not i'm i don't think i'm getting a good education i think i would probably be better off in a larger school but i don'ely know what to do about it.
B:	i think one of the problems with with education as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think is going to be a hard thing for for people to face.
M:	yeah i think i don i agree with you i i've i have a hard time getting into a a good teaching field because i think a lot a lot the people that i know that are in the education field are in that field and uh i know a lot who would who wouldn't who would benefit most from a good education.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i don tinker with it but i think you know.
B:	there probably needs to be some training on how to to to adjust to these changes as they come about. i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now.
M:	right.
B:	so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them.
M:	well it's hard to say.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh
