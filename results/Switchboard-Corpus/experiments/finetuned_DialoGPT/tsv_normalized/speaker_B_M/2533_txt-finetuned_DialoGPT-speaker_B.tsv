B:	after that, if you asked me that i wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.
M:	oh.
B:	yeah, but at the same time, i don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far i couldn't do it.
M:	well, you know, i, i'm not sure if i, uh.
B:	right, he's supposed to be able to do that.
M:	well, i've been trying to get people to vote him up for president for a while, and i just can't seem to get anybody to follow along.
B:	oh, really? i didn't know that.
M:	yeah, he was a big baseball fan,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, he just kind of sat there on the bench and looked at the score and said, well, we're going to have to do this or we're not going to do it. and i thought, i don't know.
B:	yeah, and i've been watching, uh, my husband's french and so if i've been watching the french news, when i watch it.
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	it's incentive , speaking of bush, we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of bush, they that had a story where he went to visit some little, uh, elementary school students, and stuff.
M:	oh, really.
B:	did you see that, where he, the guy asked him for proof of who he was,
M:	no.
B:	he said his .
M:	yeah, yeah, he, he must have been in on it.
B:	i know and see a credit card
M:	and i, you know, i know it's just, i'm so sick of them.
B:	it was so funny to see, it was a really cute little kid too.
M:	yeah, it's funny how little they get, but i'm sure they're going to grow up with it, you know,
B:	well, i can tell you, that the mets opened, i think, two days ago,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game, and i couldn't tell you who pitched,
M:	oh, really?
B:	but they won, the mets won.
M:	uh, uh-hued.
B:	but, yeah, not my a lot, *sp? by and then somebody else lost, maybe it was the other new york team which is the yankees,
M:	yeah.
B:	but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees, or new jersey.
M:	oh, really?
B:	yeah.
M:	well, i guess that's about all i can talk to about baseball.
B:	well, but it, then they can have them play against each other.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think it's still the new york yankees, you know,
M:	yeah. that's true.
B:	i thought they were moving to new jersey this is how much i know about baseball.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, they traded walker and francisco l. the guy that's, uh, oh, i forgot his name, he's a pitching coach for the rangers.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we went and, uh.
B:	right .
M:	and, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and he's iranian.
B:	with baseball tickets.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah .
M:	and, and he said, well, we've got enough football left, let's just give it to these other people. and i said, i'll take the other one.
B:	wow.
M:	so we had to go up there. and i said how do you like that, you should see it. and we went up there and i told him, you better see it because it's really, it's pretty good.
B:	because they're fancy seats and stuff.
M:	yeah, we're trying to get everybody up and we're going to try to go to a game on saturday or sunday night and see how it is.
B:	i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game. i rarely go but we went last year because my brother, my brother is impossible, when, um, he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff,
M:	oh, really?
B:	and if there's a game on, he's watching it. i mean, that's all there is to it,
M:	yeah.
B:	and he's like glued at the t v.
M:	uh.
B:	oh, i'm glad my husband's not like that either, i'd kill him my brother's like that and, um, see he goes to a lot of games, not a real lot, but he tries to go, then my father got us some tickets,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so my brother's wife and my husband and i went. last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because, you know, being a non-american you want to see what a baseball game is like.
M:	uh.
B:	and he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd, it was nice weather and stuff, it wasn't a real problem, but you sit there in a crowd, and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um, because we made him try a hot dog, you know ,
M:	oh, my gosh.
B:	and, um, so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored, and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time,
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah, and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it, and didn't understand it um, he grew up out, well, he grew up in , which is the, sort of o strip east to west, eastern part,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but that ,
M:	!!!%!! remind me. that's funny, because that's where i grew up.
B:	yeah, he's not that far, he was sort of in between strasbourg, and paris.
M:	yeah
B:	oh, is she still there?
M:	yeah
B:	because,
M:	okay. well, i don't know, i, i'm, i've never been to a concert in concert band.
B:	yeah, saint claude,
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah, we used to, that's one of the, um, entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i exactly where she is. but, um, we met in paris.
M:	uh, i'll bet you that was quite a experience.
B:	twelve children?
M:	yeah.
B:	oh, my god, the poor woman.
M:	yeah, yeah, she has, uh, i mean, i'm sure she has some, some work to do on that.
B:	were any of them twins?
M:	oh yeah, two of them were twins.
B:	you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
M:	oh, i know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so you can, you know, you can get them for, you're, you have to pay extra for those, because they're, they're really expensive.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	they don't, you don't see, you see them getting married or anything, but they don, they go out and they go, they do all kinds of things, so.
B:	but how do they afford to even have the kids, uh, we're expecting our first baby, almost any day uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that.
B:	wow.
M:	so, i don't know, it's just, it just, i just,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's, uh, it's not a real easy read.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and it, it's, it teaches them how to deal with problems, and how, how to fix them, and, uh, you don't just have to be good at it. you have to, you have to have the discipline to do that.
B:	i, i don't know what foley's is
M:	f foley's an electronics company.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but they're not that expensive.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean, it's, it was a lot of money, you have to pay for everything, but you don have to do it.
B:	yeah, well, that makes a really big difference. but, but, still it's just as hard as having, that,
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	but your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
M:	yeah
B:	uh-huh.
M:	yeah, that's, that was one thing that i did, i did that when i was, i was with the church, and i didn't do it anymore. i, i just,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and so it's, it's a little difficult for me to get started on it because i don, i don have a lot of friends that are into sports and so i don tinker around with it. but, uh, you see a lot on t v with kids and stuff and i'd like to start that sometime.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know.
B:	i admire someone that can do that, you know, i really can.
M:	yeah.
