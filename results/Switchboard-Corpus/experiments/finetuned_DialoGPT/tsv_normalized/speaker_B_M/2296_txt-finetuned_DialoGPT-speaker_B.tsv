M:	uh, uh-hoh.
B:	but washington is one of my favorite places to visit. uh, my daughter lives in arlington, and when i go to visit her, i love to get out on that bike trail, and either ride the bike, oh, gosh, you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern virginia or just get out and walk, uh, or even jog a little, although i don't do that regularly.
M:	do you ever go to the dallas opera?
B:	but washington's a great place to do that.
M:	oh, yeah, that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh he rides a hundred fifty miles every day.
B:	right.
M:	but, i do a lot of, uh, reading on the bike.
B:	do you live in the district?
M:	i'm in richardson.
B:	because i think there're so many parts of the district where it's not very safe to get out and walk.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it's, it, it is very safe, but, uh.
B:	well, it's, uh, it's really both. i'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape, and, uh, and most of the time i enjoy it. sometimes i don't, but i feel that, uh, that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't want to is also worth something.
M:	yeah.
B:	and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising, like i'll be really tired, and i'll start swimming, and i'll, and i'll actually get energy. and i'll be, have much more energy when i'm done than when i started, i mean, i just feel great. that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim.
M:	yeah.
B:	and that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, god, i'm ready for bed and you exercise and then, it's sort of painful for a while,
M:	right.
B:	but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.
M:	uh, i have a friend that, uh, she was an o b nurse, and she said that she was having a terrible time with weight management.
B:	yeah, yeah.
M:	and so that's, and i have a swimming pool, so that helps.
