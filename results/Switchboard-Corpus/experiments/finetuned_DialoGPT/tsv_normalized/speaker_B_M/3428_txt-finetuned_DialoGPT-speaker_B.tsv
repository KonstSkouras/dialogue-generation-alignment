B:	and um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
M:	well that's true. i mean it's it it is it would be a big problem i mean there are a lot of a lot a large number of guns out there.
B:	yeah it uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere but uh i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all and uh.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i i think so and and there's always the uh the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one and uh and then uh.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	uh i i don i mean i know people that are that are very avid gun owners. uh i'm not one of them. uh
B:	yeah.
M:	and i think that's that's one of the problems that the police have identified as being the ones who are really out to get the guns.
B:	yeah yeah that's for sure.
M:	but i don't know. i don i donno i think it would be a good idea. i i you you've got to have the people who are who are legitimate and and legitimate uh right to uh to have them you got to be able to prove that you're a legitimate owner and uh
B:	yeah and uh and you know uh i suppose uh years ago way back when uh when uh they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh and if they didn't have a way to uh to fight back they would have been in big trouble.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well the way things are going.
M:	and uh
B:	well you know they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of uh every gun you bought had to be licensed i believe.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
