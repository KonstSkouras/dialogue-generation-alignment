B:	jerry burns.
M:	okay, i know who you're talking about.
B:	he was going to keep him as the coach somehow, but, uh, i don't know, i'd like to see the vikings get revamped somehow.
M:	oh, yeah, they've got a quarterback.
B:	well, they started out really bad, they went like one and six, and then they won five or six in a row.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
M:	oh, really.
B:	yeah, i guess you can,
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but i don t remember them being so highly up and down.
