B:	i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer
M:	uh yeah.
B:	or
M:	yeah i don i mean i don t even know what the guy's name is.
B:	well for some things.
M:	yeah.
B:	i think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood
M:	right right.
B:	i mean you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that.
B:	and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective.
M:	no.
B:	but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. you know just like for example uh you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them
M:	uh-hue.
B:	and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment.
M:	uh i mean i i would think that if they had if they you had a lot of violent crimes uh you know you'd you'd want to look at that you see how many uh of them are still doing violent crimes.
B:	uh it is to a certain extent
M:	uh
B:	but i think i don't know because
M:	right.
B:	i think in and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available.
M:	uh uh-hue
B:	well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment.
M:	yeah i agree. i think so. i uh.
B:	and
M:	i i agree with you. i think i mean i'm i've seen some people get uh.
B:	but one thing i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation then that chance should be investigated.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society.
M:	right.
B:	but
M:	i think that uh you know that that you you're you have to think about it more than once though. you have to wonder if they would be willing to pay a little more to keep somebody else in line.
B:	and a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison.
M:	right.
B:	well i know in north carolina we do have capital punishment.
M:	huh-uh.
B:	and i'm i'm from south carolina.
