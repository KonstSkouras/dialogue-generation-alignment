B:	um well the see uh well we he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
M:	uh.
B:	right we wound up just choosing a another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. or but naturally no it was even mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
M:	uh-huh. oh that's that sounds awful
B:	uh what do you think?
M:	well i i don't think that uh  nursing homes are safe.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we made a point of doing that. she had been in a a nursing homes before but she has now um.
B:	yeah.
M:	so she had to make that decision on her own
B:	yeah
M:	and so uh i went in there and i was so happy to find that and uh  she had uh
B:	yeah that's important i would say.
M:	yeah. yeah i i would i really think so because it's important for your uh your family and for your future too.
B:	okay.
M:	and uh she is able to to do that and it's very convenient because you know she has a private baby-sitter that you can just trust her with whatever she decides you she will do it
B:	yeah.
M:	and she was very very concerned about me
B:	right and that becomes difficult then.
M:	it really is.
B:	uh-huh. yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
M:	uh.
B:	but he was living alone had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain
M:	uh.
B:	and this eventually things just went too far
M:	yeah that's that was my mother living with me and i was just you know i was in a a situation where my mother was in an apartment and uh you could see her crying
B:	and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.
M:	yeah that's that would be a nightmare.
B:	right
M:	and she's she's gone through a period of depression and she's had to find a good home and and uh take care of herself and everything.
B:	well that's yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing.
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	and.
M:	and uh she was really good but i i you know i just i don't think that that uh that we have to you you have to be so totally convinced that you're you can't do everything on her every day.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and she doesn't have to be there during the day she can just go right down the hallway and sit and and and you know
B:	yep.
M:	!!!%
