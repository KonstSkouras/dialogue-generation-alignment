B:	okay. go ahead.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!! do you have any children?
B:	yeah
M:	and and and you know that's that i i don't really know i think i mean i do i really do. i think that there's there's a lot of things that uh that i think we should do to to help people out.
B:	that's true.
M:	and uh  i think that we've we've learned a great deal from it.
B:	um me either. i i went to college and then started working and then got married and
M:	uh-huh.
B:	no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to uh teach in a small town down in south texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah she only taught there one year but i
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	well she got some money from the school but i think she only had a portion of it.
B:	and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and he was um some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that.
M:	uh uh-homing
B:	so you know if i think that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
B:	yeah. as far as yeah getting doctors and all that stuff yeah.
M:	well it it depends on the doctor. i mean if you want to go into a profession you have to be willing to go out and uh
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's not a you're right it's a major medical problem but it's something that needs to be addressed and uh and it's going to be a big uh
B:	yeah.
M:	but
B:	i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the peace corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when
M:	!!!%!!clamation point!! remind me of that. i used to do that quite a bit when i was in the peace corps you're right.
B:	yeah. and don't they go into other countries and stuff?
M:	!!!!!!clamation!! there!!
B:	uh-huh. things that make the yeah. make them more self-supporting?
M:	yeah yeah make them self-starters.
B:	yeah.
M:	they they they have a very uh
B:	right. yeah.
M:	and uh you know i think uh.
B:	but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
M:	yeah. that's true. that that's true that that really is true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and um i know um.
B:	yeah.
M:	i think that would be a really good thing to do.
B:	i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	i don't know that that would work if somebody's was didn't really want to be there and didn't have
M:	yeah well that's true.
B:	yeah i mean there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh you just don't want to go into that.
B:	yeah.
M:	and that's the way they're going to do it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and and that's that's one of the problems.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh they uh they're very very uh...
B:	right yeah.
M:	but they're in the process of being
B:	yeah uh-huh.
M:	they're uh
B:	yeah.
M:	and i mean i i'm i guess i'm kind of old-fashioned too. i think that uh
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know i don i'm i guess i'm cynical of the whole thing but i don think there could be a more permanent solution to it.
B:	well down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	but i mean i think that's i don't know that's a that that is a a problem with the united states. i think it's a big problem. i don t understand why the united nations uh why they don't have more input into it. i mean i it's like you know why not why why we don't want some assistance.
B:	and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the united states.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know and i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean  because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but.
M:	that that that is the whole thing. i i don't know.
B:	yeah.
M:	you know what if you gave them money to clean out their closets and tell them they need some lube?
B:	or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves
M:	right.
B:	i mean i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but.
M:	yeah. yeah.
B:	yeah i mean it's true. yeah.
M:	it's not like they're going to you can't
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh i don i know that there are a lot of other organizations that could do it.
B:	flower mound yeah. so we're a little you know farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.
M:	right.
