B:	and we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under roger staubach . and we kind of got spoiled.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	we expected it to continue forever. i think they're doing pretty well this year though.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think two.
M:	did they just lose both games?
B:	i know they lost, yeah, to washington and philadelphia.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah, and wasn't that fun. i went to the balloon festival in plano and carried my little portable radio with me, and i must say i attracted a lot of attention.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	people running up saying, oh, what's the score, what's the score?
M:	yeah
B:	that's right and that's exactly what they said, to sound like a my wife dragged me away from the television.
M:	right.
B:	you know, but i wasn't, i had forgotten or i probably wouldn't have been there.
M:	well, that's, that, that must have been a wonderful experience.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i don't think i'd have thought about it being a problem if it weren't for the fact that, you know, you have to have something to do.
B:	that's exactly where both of the wives came from i think.
M:	oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	it was, uh, you know, it's easier to join them than fight them.
M:	yeah. well, it, it was, it really was. it was,
B:	and if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.
M:	yeah.
B:	and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say, my gosh did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about, these games.
M:	right.
B:	well, it takes a little brainwashing first.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	i don't know. i mean, you know, i, i think we're probably going to stay here for a while, maybe even longer, you don't, you wouldn't like that.
B:	are you, uh, transit usually? i mean do you stay not in one place too long?
M:	no, no.
B:	well, it will take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for denver.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	oh, i know.
M:	and then you get to see the sights and the, the mountains and, and, uh it's, it's just, it really is fun.
B:	well, if they close it in, see, we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing.
M:	yeah.
B:	but, uh, dan reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.
M:	yeah, he's, he is, he really is.
B:	yeah, that's right, you know he was one of ours, one of our boys.
M:	oh, that was a fun movie.
B:	so we are never, we never cheer against denver unless they're playing the cowboys.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	and, uh, so, i, i just, i like to go out and just, you can't take the chance.

B:	well, there is so much about it to like.
M:	yeah.
B:	you know it's so exciting.
M:	yeah.
B:	and when the cowboys won the superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs, and we all ran out and bought the records, and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
