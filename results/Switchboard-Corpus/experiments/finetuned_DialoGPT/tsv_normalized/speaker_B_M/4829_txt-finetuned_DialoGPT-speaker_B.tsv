B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they have one for the homeless and one for, uh for the regular people.
B:	right.
M:	so,
B:	oh. right. over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can take, uh, recycled, materials to. but, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they have, uh, the first saturday of every month, they have certain places that you can drop them off. that's what i do. uh, and i, i recycle aluminum, glass, uh, newspapers.
M:	uh-oh.
B:	so it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place
M:	yeah.
B:	right. so it's, so that's nice. it would be, it would be really nice if they, uh, came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that, but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	right. i guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something, you know.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh, so i guess that's one option.
M:	but i think that's a bigger waste.
B:	i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too. like, uh
M:	uh-huh.
B:	have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this little number now that tells what  kind of plastic it is?
M:	yeah, they've started to do that.
B:	yeah, i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle, you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.
M:	uh,
B:	yeah. so now they're like marking, uh, they're, i don't know, there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is.
M:	!!!!,!!you're kidding.
B:	so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess.
M:	!!!!,!!iful!!
B:	right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	where does your friend go to to recycle?
M:	uh, he goes to garland high, and he, he has a recycling center, but it's not big enough for, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but she also, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh, i don't know, i guess, i've kind of gotten used to it and i don, i mean, i haven't, i never tried to, uh
B:	i guess that's how it gets passed on. you know, when one person, you hear  from another person
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.
M:	yeah, yeah.
B:	it seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, i guess
M:	yeah, i know. i, i, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	he's, he's a little boy with a, with a beard and a beard.
B:	uh-huh. wow, that's cute. that's neat, yeah. when you,
M:	so he's, uh
B:	well, when you start early, i guess,
