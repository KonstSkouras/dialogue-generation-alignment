B:	oh, uh-huh, yeah, and sometimes the, the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that, uh, they should be.
M:	yeah, i've, i, i know that i've never registered for one and never have been registered for it.
B:	right, and, uh, there's usually nobody running against, you know, the incumbents.
M:	uh-hums.
B:	right. so, uh, but i, i feel that, uh, a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting.
M:	uh-hugs.
B:	and, it's, it's, they're, and also they're fed up with the system, and they say, well, why should i even vote.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
M:	so, you know, they don, they just don't want to vote for either one of them.
B:	right. the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, i know it the last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so i don't know, i, i, it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go.
M:	well, i think it's going to be different though, because texas has had some, uh some really bad years.
B:	yeah, i think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem, and i think it could get worse.
M:	i do, too.
B:	you know, we get this lackadaisical attitude, and say, huh, you know, why should we vote, then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh. right, uh, yeah, we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull.
M:	right.
B:	yes. uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	yeah, and, uh, who's the other guy, larouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and, uh, but he's got, he's been put away for, uh, credit card fraud, i believe.
M:	uh-oh.
B:	yeah, lyndon larouche, that's it.
M:	uh-hau.
B:	and, uh, yeah.
M:	well, i think we both agree that, that we need to do something about, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	you know, that, that people would think that, you know, he wouldn't do that, but, uh.
B:	right. if you don't go and vote, then, you know, very good chance that they, they will because a lot of the people like that, they'll strike a chord in something, you know, in some of the people, that so will say, look, you know, this guy's got everything together.
M:	and, and they'll all just stand there and listen to him. and then they'll get, you, you're right, they're going to say, oh we don't want to do this.
B:	you know, i like what he says, and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him.
M:	well, you can't say that because he's not going to be around any more.
B:	and, uh, i think that's sort of what happened with louisiana because, because, um, the guy did get elected, correct?
M:	yeah, yeah, and, uh.
B:	that's what i thought.
M:	yeah, yeah, i know what you're saying.
B:	and, uh, , but you know, they can always fool us, you know. he might do a good job.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	oh, yeah.
M:	and you have no idea what's going on.
B:	what we do, usually, is, uh, vote, uh, absenteeism
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, i know, here, you know, you don't have to have any reason, you can just go and vote
M:	right.
B:	and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks, the hours are good and they're even open on saturdays and a couple of sundays.
M:	uh.
B:	and so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in houston, it's, uh, the lines are long.
M:	yeah.
B:	so, uh, but, uh,
M:	i know in, in, i know in the dallas area, it, it seems like, uh the, uh
B:	well, uh, i recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line
M:	yeah.
B:	and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day.
M:	right, right.
B:	uh-huh, yeah.
M:	you don't have to wait until the next turn.
B:	um, yeah, i've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the republican party. and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots, but, uh, my mind has gone blank. i've been all evening how they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for
M:	uh,
B:	you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on, and, uh, it's, it's interesting.
M:	uh, uh-hau, yeah that's, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh
B:	right. there for a while, that would, that worked. we've, uh, i know i have, um, i'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes i'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy.
M:	uh, i guess i'd have to say the one thing i, i like to see is, uh  is the, uh, party system in, in texas where the, the, party system is so easy to get rid of.
B:	but, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then i'll, i'll vote for the party because i know, you know, something about the other guy
M:	right, right.
B:	or, you know, they're both just as bad, and i'll say, well, i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party, and, um, but yeah. you know, that's not the best way but,
M:	no, i don't know, i mean, i, i do, i just think it's, it's really a dumb, i guess, uh
B:	but it gets to the point where, i mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for.
M:	yeah, i think, uh-huh.
B:	right, or what you've heard on t v, which i think is just outrageous.
M:	yeah.
B:	i, i don't agree with how the media handles elections.
M:	well, i, i think it's the media, but i think that, uh, i would like to see them, uh.
B:	i, you know, i'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know, this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	it's just, it's just ridiculous.
M:	well, i think that, uh, i, i know that, um, i've seen a lot of these things on t v, and i think they, they tend to sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized.
B:	uh-huh, it really could, and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead, and they keep dragging it on, and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
M:	right.
B:	yeah, so, uh,
M:	i mean, i'm not saying that it's not going to be popular, but it's certainly not going be popular either.
B:	they really do. i, i sometimes think that that should be limited more.
M:	uh-uh.
B:	oh, yes, or they, i agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments, but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	no, they don't.
M:	i think that's, that's a shame, because they really ought to do something about, you're right, they ought to put these people in jail, and then, you, you can't expect them to, you'll, you won't get them out of jail, you might get somebody,
B:	well, i enjoyed talking to you.
M:	you too, and, uh, thank you for calling.
B:	all right.
M:	bye-bye.
B:	bye-bye.
