B:	oh, that's wonderful. okay.
M:	uh, so i have two kids, so we're, uh, we're eating out probably about an average of four or five a week, and, uh we're spending about four hours a week with them.
B:	that's, what kind of fondue, the cheese dip or,
M:	oh yeah, yeah.
B:	right. yeah.
M:	and then i'll make like a little swiss cheese and put it on top of it. and then i just cover it with foil and put the foil on, and then i cover it up with foil, and let it steam.
B:	oh, that sounds good.
M:	so, i, i had to stop by the store to buy that and i thought, i'm going to end up making that
B:	that's always a good thing. vegetable trays always go over so well, because i think people get tired of eating junk. i mean, i think they like to have healthy stuff too, you know it's,
M:	yeah.
B:	oh, definitely. i think better even than, than other kinds of food
M:	yeah, that's true.
B:	right, exactly. yeah.
M:	i, i like to eat, um, i don't know, i'm a real foodie, and i like good food.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so, it's a lot of work.
B:	oh. yes. right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	right, that's true. or even have you ever seen where they, they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out, and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
M:	uh-uh. uh-uh, uh-uh
B:	yep.
M:	!!!%!! remindme!!
B:	oh, i think it would, it would be a lot of work but, um, you know, because it's, you know,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff but, but i think they're really neat and, you know, i think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
M:	i think they are, too.
B:	oh, yeah
M:	yeah
B:	right. yeah.
M:	so, i mean, it's, it is, it really is a treat.
B:	is that, is that good? you know, i've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but i've never tried it, are they really good?
M:	oh, they're wonderful.
B:	oh, i bet it doesn't mix well, does it?
M:	!!!%!! remind me!! commands!! command!!!!! execute!! execution!! display!! global!!sv!!ety!! collision!!body!! element!! this!!
B:	oh, well, that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately. because they weren't in season,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
M:	oh yeah, yeah.
B:	oh, is that right?
M:	yeah
B:	oh, i .
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	so, you know, it's, it, it seems like there's so much of it going on that it's almost frantic, you just don't know what to do.
B:	well,
M:	what, what, what kind of, what type of, um
B:	okay, sure,
M:	yeah, i'm a big, uh, grower, i mean, i have all kinds of growlers and, uh
B:	is that right? i've never heard of that.
M:	yeah, but, uh, it's good, it gives you a little more flavor.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then you, uh, you, you pour the wine over the top of the box and you cover it with foil and then you let it steam.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but it's a good idea.
B:	i think i know what you're is it like a hand held?
M:	yeah.
B:	the, yeah, okay.
M:	yeah, i, i've seen those.
B:	uh-huh. huh.
M:	you have to mix it with water, and you have to stir it in real carefully.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then i put in, uh.
B:	oh, wow. that is really interesting. are you saying to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,
M:	uh, no, it doesn't taste like it.
B:	unsweetened?
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	and it's just a tablespoon of it, and you mix it all together.
B:	i have some
M:	okay, i guess we're ready to start.
B:	i just want to,
M:	you know, to go back to school and not have to work.
B:	right. okay.
M:	it's kind of sweetened up with a little lemon wedge in it, but it's real hard to chew.
B:	cooking chocolate.
M:	yeah, i've never tried that. i don't know if you've ever tried that, but it sounds good.
B:	that's really interesting, i've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
M:	!!! remindme!! you've got mail.
B:	is that right? oh, neat,
M:	yeah, so, i found that, um.
B:	that is just really neat. because i,
M:	i'm a real foodie.
B:	it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
M:	yeah, well, that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so that you don't have to do, uh, you know, so much work, but, uh
B:	so you put the milk in the cornstarch?
M:	!!!;!! remind me of that now.
B:	and then put that back in the saucepan?
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that now.
B:	huh that's,
M:	so,
B:	oh.
M:	and then it's like it's a little bit too much. but,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and it's just a little bit,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and i use that to make the sauce and then i put the chicken over the, over the pan. and then i cover it with foil and pop it in the oven. and pop it into the oven for just a couple of minutes to melt it all up.
B:	do do you put it in the refrigerator then or
M:	well, we just put it on the ground.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then, uh you know, just, you know a little bit, uh.
B:	right, that's true. i knew that.
M:	but, uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean, that was just,
B:	yeah.
M:	but, uh, i, i don't know.
