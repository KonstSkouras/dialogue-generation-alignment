B:	it's you know it's a game to her but i i do not like to do that i consider it kind of a a waste of my time. and so i'm usually uh pretty careful when i shop
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	and i also you know usually have have checked over things you know if it's like an appliance or something to make sure uh it has the features in it that i want.
M:	uh i see.
B:	now we've had one lately um oh a uh a dustbuster plus that we bought
M:	uh.
B:	and we've had it for a while but all of a sudden it just wasn't working and it looks like there's a part missing from it. my husband opened it up and whatever and of course we don't have the receipt any more so we can't take it back
M:	oh.
B:	uh but i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
M:	yeah.
B:	uh
M:	i think uh the quality of the uh the crafts you know as far as uh crafts and so forth uh...
B:	yeah.
M:	and it's it's really a pain.
B:	well that's true and lot of times though it is it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know if it's
M:	well you can't always get it fixed.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	well yeah i think a lot of times if you get a brand name uh you know if it's a a good brand
M:	uh well i don't know if you've heard about the the uh the sears uh sears the one that uh that just opened up here a few months ago.
B:	i you i think there's there can be a lemon in anything but uh i think more often than not
M:	uh-uh. yeah i i agree with you there.
B:	you you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time and uh you know if you buy a good one you shouldn't have any you know too much of a problem with it
M:	that's right.
B:	i mean we we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
M:	right right.
B:	we never could get it declared a lemon and the car would go and without any warning whatsoever you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i there was just you know and oh we went round and round with the manufacturer and and everything and they got it finally semifixed but it was such a hassle
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah yeah it it really is uh but gee this is of all the topics i have had i'm doing this thing this is kind of the strangest one.
M:	well it's funny because i've talked to people who have had dogs and they say that they have the greatest reactions.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're not going to they're saying well you can't have you're not allowed to have it anymore and i thought you you got to get it and you're supposed to you have to make this deal so you didn't you don't want to make a deal you want to get rid of it.
B:	well i think that's true and i uh now we generally don't buy a warranty because you think you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and and he'll uh you know he'll fix it right away but it's just not something that you want to do.
B:	i think technology is better i'm i'm not sure. i think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
M:	!!!;!!%!! remind me of that
B:	i don't think necessarily that things are being made better uh you know
M:	!!!%!! remind me!!clamation!!ety!!
B:	i i everything is so automated uh and things can be made without i think a human hand ever touching it you know an awful lot of things
M:	yeah.
B:	and i think that certainly makes a difference from back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and you know had some pride in it.
M:	right right.
B:	well yeah that's that's true.
M:	i think i mean it's it it would be nice to have a a little bit of variety you don't have to have everything in one place.
B:	yeah well i i do uh you know craft work and sell stuff at shows and that and uh uh you know it's it's it's a real eye-opener as far as you know why people charge what they do to you know.
