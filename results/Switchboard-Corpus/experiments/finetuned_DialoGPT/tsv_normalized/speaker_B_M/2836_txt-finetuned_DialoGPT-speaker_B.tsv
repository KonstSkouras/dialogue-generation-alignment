B:	uh-huh.
M:	um, i mean, it's, it is a problem, but it's not a problem that just many people have.
B:	uh, where i live now it's, it's not so bad. i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it. uh, but i do have friends that live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing. uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this.
M:	yeah.
B:	i live out in the country, yeah.
M:	oh, i see.
B:	i'm about fifteen miles out.
M:	oh, that's a pretty small town.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and so i have to drive about twenty miles each way.
B:	um.
M:	and we have a couple of areas that are really, really bad areas.
B:	um.
M:	it's, it's, uh, it, it has a lot of different problems. i mean, you have to, you know, you're not sure, you don't know who you're going to come up against,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so, it's, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i, i, you have to wonder about the, uh...
B:	wow. that's huge .
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	so, uh  it's a real problem.
B:	are there, are there any theories on why this is happening?
M:	well, the, the one theory i have is that, uh it's not, uh the crime is not going to go down as much as it used to, and that, that's one theory, but, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't know.
B:	but why? why is it happening?
M:	i don't know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so, it's, it, it keeps the family budget from, uh uh, you know, it makes it, uh  easier to, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, you know, it's, it is a big problem. i, i don't know what the solution is. i think we have to do something. i don tought about this at all.
B:	so they're professionals?
M:	yes.
B:	um.
M:	they're not, uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh
B:	um.
M:	i, i don't know, i think that's a little far fetched, but i think it would be a great idea.
B:	well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?
M:	well i think, i think the thing is, is that, that, uh, you see, you, you say, well, i don't know. what do you do about, uh,
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh. right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	but, i mean, that's going to tend to, i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit. the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place.
M:	right.
B:	right. they're doing that in our state, too.
M:	yeah.
B:	so you think that would be a deterrent?
M:	i don't know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i mean, i don't know. i, i guess i'm kind of, uh-hating on it.
B:	well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?
M:	well then, then they have the right to know that they have been,
B:	right.
M:	but, uh.
B:	so you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	uh-huh. huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	right.
M:	because it's a capital crime.
B:	oh, wow. oh, my goodness.
M:	and, uh, it was, it's, it really was a very violent and, uh it was very violent.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but it was really a tough time. i think we all came up with, with a good start, but, uh.
B:	uh-huh. right. wow.
M:	but, uh.
B:	did you, did you sue him under the civil system?
M:	uh, yeah.
B:	did you sue him under the civil system?
M:	uh, i did, i just got a letter from them, saying, uh, that they're going to start paying attorneys, and i just signed up for it.
B:	well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right, and try to get money from him
M:	yeah.
B:	and,
M:	oh, that's good.
B:	yeah. makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing.
M:	that's right.
B:	but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt.
M:	that's right.
B:	yeah, that's too bad.
M:	but, um, i guess, you know, i, i don't know, maybe it's because, i'm not a great athlete, i think i'm average at this point, but, um.
B:	uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and they've got the money to pay for it, but, you, you're right, it's, it costs so much, you can't afford it.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	i, i'm not sure that, uh
B:	yeah, i, i think that's yeah. yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	that's awful
M:	yeah, it is, it's really, i mean, i'm, i know it's a big problem, but, uh.
B:	gives you sympathy for the vigilantes.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	it's not like he's going to go into a neighborhood and do something with his kids or whatever.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, you know, it's, it, it seems to me that, uh uh, they're trying to do a, a good thing here by, uh putting the, uh the, the, a, the authorities in charge.
B:	oh, my god.
M:	and then the person who broke the law gets the money anyway.
B:	right.
M:	and it's, it's really a, it, it really is a problem.
B:	right.
M:	but i, i, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we're going to protect our citizens,
B:	right.
M:	but if you catch yourself short on cash and you need it, you're going to have to use it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then, uh, we have a dog, and she, uh she does everything just fine.
B:	and that, that's a deterrent, too. if you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake
M:	uh.
B:	here you break in, and you're going to get shot.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, i think that that's one of the worst things that's happened to me. i've been in, i've served on a jury before, but i never actually had the opportunity to serve on one.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	huh.
M:	so, it's a real problem.
B:	wow,
M:	so, uh, that's, uh that's about it, you see, a lot of the crimes that are committed, uh you know in the in the cities are the same as, uh the crimes of passion and stuff like that.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're all,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so, you have to be pretty selective in your area to get a good newspaper.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i think they ought to get on with a, a, uh a more thorough trial before they settle the case.
B:	yeah. uh-huh. i mean, i, i tend to agree with you. i think, uh, what i would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes. uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and, and worry about these things where people are getting hurt.
M:	uh-uh. right.
B:	and i think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship. and they lose their constitutional rights. you know,
M:	right, exactly.
B:	and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them.
M:	uh, i know, i don't think i could live in a place like that.
B:	i know, and i think, i think that's ridiculous.
M:	and i don't think the courts work.
