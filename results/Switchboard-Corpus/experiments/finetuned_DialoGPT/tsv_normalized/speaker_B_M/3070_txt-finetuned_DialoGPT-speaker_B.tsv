M:	but we haven't really done that much,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh  it, it's really been good
B:	right.
M:	so we don't have a regular vacation time.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and so, uh, i, i try to, i'm not really, you know, i don't really, i think that it's really a waste of my money to go spend with somebody who doesn't have insurance.
B:	well, it might be a good time for you to to, to start a tradition.
M:	yeah.
B:	you could be responsible for that yourself.
M:	right.
B:	sure.
M:	and, uh, and then i, i also think that, uh you know, i think that maybe there are other ways of, uh...
B:	well, in my family, let's see, last october was the forty fifth annual  uh, reunion.
M:	oh.
B:	the first sunday in october, the jordan family gets together.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and all of the descendants of the civil war, i mean, yeah, the civil war veterans come together, and they come as far away from california, and there's usually oh, between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, there's a big community hall in vernon texas,
M:	oh.
B:	and, uh, that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	do you have any relatives there?
B:	right, uh-huh. a lot of the older family lives in vernon.
M:	!!!%!!;!! remind me of that.
B:	um, all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.
M:	uh-uh. uh-hum.
B:	so we're talking about second and third great children here.
M:	uh-hau, uh, oh, yes.
B:	uh, i take my boys well, i took them up until this year, they're grown and gone from home now
M:	uh-huh.
B:	so they, they take their family.
M:	oh, that's great.
B:	but, uh, let's see, that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather, okay, so it would be the second great grandchild. and so they,
M:	so they would have a great big family. yeah.
B:	well, it's a community center, it's a community hall. it's,  a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen it in,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, you just bring the covered dishes. every, every family brings a, a dish of some kind, and you get all the wonderful old family recipes,  that have been handed,  down for years
M:	uh-huh.
B:	well, we try to stay away from those things which might have, uh, salmonella in them.
M:	oh, i know.
B:	and we choose to bring congealed salad. you can bring a congealed vegetable salad,  as opposed to potato salad.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, uh, sanitation aspects,  whatever you've got to carry for any distance.
M:	uh-huh. uh-hue.
B:	i always, take home baked bread.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh, that happens to be my specialty for that family. i do other things very well,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but there are others in the family who do them better.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, you know, i do some of the cooking for my daughter and there are some others who are just as easy, you can tell.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i've heard that it's really a good way to develop,  you know, the family structure and  and get out of the house.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and we talked about how, how we did, uh,
B:	uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! translated it's a great book.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so it was a very, very, uh uh, uh...
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	so that's interesting, but, uh.
B:	well, it's, uh, we have, uh, uh, kind of a core group that, that serves as, quote, officers of the organization,
M:	uh.
B:	and they plan the reunions, the organize the, you know, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there, who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer. uh, and each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.
M:	right, right.
B:	we have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member, and they're entered into a, a wonderful, uh, scrap book. and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone. and it keeps the family alive,  even, you know, even though it's very fluid.
M:	huh.
B:	and they're very dedicated to that, and, uh, it's been really wonderful. it helps you hang onto your roots.
M:	oh, yeah.
B:	and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging. my husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family. his family was very scattered and very diverse.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	"and i asked him, i got to talking to him, i said, well, how is his nephew doing. ""well, i don't know, i haven't,  talked to my brother in three years."" i said , ""well, how's your brother doing?"" ""i don't know."" uh, you know, my son keeps in touch with him, i think, but i don't."
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	"i said, ""hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?"" ""yeah, but i'm, you know, it's too much trouble."" so i got busy, got together, and put a reunion together for his family. and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one to our place down at lake tawakoni."
M:	!!!%!! remind me. that's a, that's a really nice area.
B:	liked to kill me, because i it was, i didn't have that group cooperation, i did,  it by myself.
M:	!!!%!!etwork!! remind me.
B:	and, uh, nobody brought covered dishes. we had a great big fish fry, and, you know, i fixed a salad in a number three tub.
M:	oh, that sounds great.
B:	and, and, uh, it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping. and, uh, we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him,
M:	oh, i'm sorry, i missed that. yeah, i don't know what they were,
B:	"we did it that year, and then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there. we sent invitations. we said, ""please let us know if you're coming."" it was when, uh, his mother, his step father had died the year before,"
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and it, his mother was alone, and so they came to support her, and then one by one, his you know, his sisters, he began to lose family members,
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and it was difficult to hold them together. and then, of course, he died two years ago, so, you know, that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.
M:	yeah.
B:	and, uh, it, i think that's what happens when they get scattered, the, the family unit, you know, falls,  into disrepair.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but it was, it was something that we had planned on going on.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but the second one was, uh, it was a good one, too.
B:	uh-huh. well, see, we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive. they'll send out news bulletins. two or three times a year you'll get a news hey, guess who got, you know, elected to the legislature, or guess who our local sheriff,
