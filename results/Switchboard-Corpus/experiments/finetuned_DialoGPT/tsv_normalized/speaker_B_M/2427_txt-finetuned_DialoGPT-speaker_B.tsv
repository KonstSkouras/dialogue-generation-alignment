B:	yeah. i have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	it's a long skinny one and
M:	!!!;!! remindme!!i'm trying to remember what that's called.
B:	oh i see. yeah. i see.
M:	and uh.
B:	right. right. yeah it's nice to get out in the open air.
M:	yeah.
B:	and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever
M:	yeah.
B:	but uh  sometimes i  i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know.
M:	yeah. yeah.
B:	i grow a lot of things a lot of food.
M:	uh-hauhuh uh-hue.
B:	and sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant. some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh squash or something  like that.  plant one of those
M:	uh uh-uh. uh i see. uh.
B:	and it takes up your whole space
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah. yeah. they they just run all over the place don't they
M:	yeah they they're real easy to grow.
B:	right. right.
M:	i don't know it's it just i just think it's so much work i don't i i'm glad i'm not the kind of person that does it you know
B:	the basics. right. yeah. that's what we do too.
M:	i love to do uh like the the uh like the french doors and stuff.
B:	right. peas
M:	and i like to keep them for a rainy season.
B:	i i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	the first one they started them indoors this time. i read it
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and so i
M:	well it's it was a real good movie.
B:	yeah. i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work.
M:	!!!%!!eting!! remind me.
B:	because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered
M:	yeah.
B:	and i i don't think i'll do it again
M:	yeah well that's understandable.
B:	oh yeah. yeah i enjoy it. i come home from work and and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and inspect it
M:	uh-hue
B:	and the kids want to swing
M:	sure sure. well i we've uh had a couple of different things. one of them was that i was trying to decide what kind of paint to buy. i had this wonderful latex paint that i just i just had not yet used.
B:	and i push them on swing.
M:	sure you got to get them down.
B:	and i i mow my own lawn.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i do i don't have a sprinkler system. i i don't enjoy watering.
M:	well i uh i grew up in nebraska and uh.
B:	especially
M:	well that's that that sounds like you're you're very good at it then.
B:	oh how
M:	and uh we've been real pleased with it.
B:	oh.
M:	we've been in it like i think two years now.
B:	yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning. and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. i i usually get it started for my wife
M:	yeah
B:	and i and she moves it around ever other day.
M:	uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i you know i don tinker with it too much.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	but uh i like to uh i like the outdoors and i like having my house to look at too.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh i didn't want to do it. i was tired of it.
B:	yeah. sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of .
M:	yeah and i don't know if you have that in your area. we have a real strict no smoking policy.
B:	but uh they want too much money.
M:	uh well it's a problem that we've got here that if if you know if we don't we don tinker with the the system uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	right. right. but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.
M:	oh yeah it's a lot cheaper.
B:	right and the weed come up
M:	yeah. and uh
B:	and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but uh i mean i i've had i think uh a couple of good ideas in the paper and i'm not one of them
B:	well if you  enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and and do it and stuff when you only have to
M:	uh-huh.
B:	right.
M:	so.
B:	when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	when they when they switch to switch
M:	yeah.
B:	when we get an hour more
M:	uh
B:	when they rollback an hour.
M:	yeah i know.
B:	i don't know.
M:	okay.
B:	i really don't know. it just seems like i here it on the news the day before.
M:	yeah.
B:	and uh i i think it's coming up here soon.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	it's uh.
B:	are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden?
M:	um i'm i've had some some pretty i don't know what kind of grass they are but i've got a pretty good size porch and uh it's got it's just about seventeen by twenty.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i use about three times as much as i should.
B:	right. right. i i it seems like they come in spurts.
M:	yeah they do.
B:	one year i didn't put anything on and i didn't have any problems.
M:	yeah.
B:	next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they're called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever.
M:	oh i know i've seen those.
B:	they were just covered with them
M:	uh.
B:	i mean i went up i didn't go out there for about three days you know because i and i went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem
M:	oh no.
B:	they devoured it that quickly.
M:	yeah that's right that that was a really good movie.
B:	and they they have a you a good appetite
M:	right.
B:	and they would you know i i picked off like twenty of them and
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	yeah and they just they just kill everything everything.
B:	they got that uh what is that safer soap uh b t spray this year.
M:	yeah that's what it's called.
B:	and i've been watching them every day and i've and i haven't seen any signs yet. so if i see any signs i'm going to spray them
M:	uh yeah.
B:	and uh
M:	well that's that that is that would be a good idea.
B:	right.
M:	and it's like uh-huh.
B:	well the good stuff. right.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.!! translated!! translate!!if!! remind me!!ety!! translation!!two!!sv!!all!!all!!you!!?!!body!!they!!you!!it!!that!!yeah!!we!!well!!and!!okay!!do!! make!! presents!!i!!one!!did!!oh!!yes!!have!!
B:	right. yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh i had sandy loam hauled in. i had a dump truck come and dump it.
M:	oh no.
B:	on my driveway i guess that's what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in.
M:	oh i see.
B:	but uh you know you can improve your own soil there
M:	uh yeah.
B:	but the texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil.
M:	uh i'm not sure what the soil is like down there.
B:	right. and you know if i i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what i mean
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. do you have do you have a rotor tiller?
M:	no i don't but i do have one at work and i have been wanting to get one at home and and so i thought well i'll just go ahead and get one and see what it looks like you don't have to do that much work.
B:	small enough you have a just do it by hand?
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	how big is it?
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	but uh
B:	yeah. i'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines.
M:	uh-huh. yeah i i'm not really into that too much. i'm more into the crafts and stuff.
B:	and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that.
M:	oh that's great.
B:	my neighbor across the street has one. he always uses it to dethatch his lawn
M:	uh.
B:	i see him out there
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
M:	uh.
B:	yeah. yeah.
M:	yeah so that's you know it's not something that i would really have you i wouldn't have uh a a need for for a you wouldn't uh you wouldn tinker around with it or anything.
B:	i have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van bring it home and check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it.
M:	yeah.
B:	that would be nice.
M:	and uh i i don't know i think i'd like to have the the automatic you can have the seat belts on on the door.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and and so i guess we've had to do a lot of repairs uh just to to make sure that that uh that um that it that the that we do it right.
B:	what have you got growing right now?
M:	well it's it it is uh a perennial flower uh...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and then we're we're also we've got uh some blackberries and uh and some blueberries.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so i'm going to have to cut them up and put them in jars and let them come out.
B:	uh-huh. yeah.
M:	i think it's done and i think i'll enjoy it.
B:	okay
M:	i'll just close the door behind me
B:	what kind
M:	what kind of snow?
B:	what kind of onions do you grow? do you grow those those ten fifteen y?
M:	uh no no.
B:	oh they they are the best.
M:	yes.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	so we put them in a bag and we put the tomatoes in there and the peppers and then the uh tomatoes and then we put in some uh tomatoes and onions and i'm not sure what i put in the other two.
B:	uh those
M:	and i thought well i can just take them home and put them outside.
B:	i see.
M:	and uh.
B:	yeah. i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like october
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare.
M:	uh i i'm not sure how i feel about that. i don't know how to judge it. i think it's good.
B:	she made these onion rings that were so good
M:	oh yeah.
B:	and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in  that it's an ingredient
M:	yeah i know i don't i'm amazed at how much stuff i i've put in.
B:	and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
M:	oh.
B:	right. right. we froze a lot of peppers. we let some turn red.
M:	oh yeah.
B:	and some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas. and and chops them up in recipes and things like that.
M:	uh-hums.
B:	oh yeah. put them in salad yeah.
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	you're you're making me hungry here.
M:	yeah.
B:	oh.
M:	and it's it's real good.
B:	yellow peppers huh.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah. sounds like you have a real good garden.
M:	well we do. we have a pretty small backyard.
B:	just let me see what i got i got the peas and i've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets.
M:	oh that sounds good.
B:	uh and i planted potatoes too.

B:	we've got some good um um hybrid burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers
M:	uh.
B:	and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own

B:	i know it. i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know?
M:	yeah.
B:	i guess. but we're going to try that and see how that works.
M:	well that's good.
B:	an experiment.
M:	yeah.
B:	i'd like to try you know just try something new every year that i haven't tried before
M:	yeah that's that that would be good.
B:	and
M:	yeah i've heard that's really good.
B:	well.
M:	yeah.
