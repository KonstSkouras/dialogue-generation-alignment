B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh i donno i'm not sure if they have it up there. i don i think it's up there where you actually have to register as a capital case.
B:	yeah. uh-huh well from what i i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this year or was it during the last year during a year's time i think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. meanwhile there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.
M:	it's getting to be a big problem.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and some of the people that are in there now i don't know are still on death row.
B:	yeah everybody's got that.
M:	i mean you can't you don't know there's no room for all of them.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. uh-huh.
M:	so it's not just the prison people it is the society in general.
B:	yeah. isn't isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was.
M:	oh yeah i remember that. i think it was  it was on the news a little bit  a couple of days ago.
B:	it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. in the in the presidential race. uh may it may not have been maryland. it may have been massachusetts i don't remember.
M:	i don't know. i've only been up here a couple of weeks and i can barely remember what the uh the
B:	anyway well the question is you know do you think it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right?
M:	uh-huh.
B:	if it
M:	but i think they're going to be you you have to think about uh.
B:	uh-huh
M:	you know i mean it's just
B:	yeah. well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
M:	right.
B:	the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh you know their their success rate is very high. crime does pay you can make a good living at it.
M:	uh-uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	so you don't know you're right they may have just been caught and uh
B:	last year it was d c i guess baltimore caught them.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh
M:	and it's just not it doesn't it isn't anywhere near as much of a deterrent as it once was.
B:	yeah.
M:	you know they have to get a a get a new one
B:	yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently.
M:	!!! remind me of that.
B:	i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i don't think much of of life imprisonment. first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother. just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
M:	well that's true i know i have a friend who's a a uh a prison fanatic and uh she's sentenced to death for for like uh theft of property.
B:	so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty so
M:	yeah yeah.
B:	yeah and and also um the the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
M:	well that's true too.
B:	and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened and and base the sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
M:	uh-huh.
B:	uh-huh
M:	and he was trying to decide between uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but he was killed by a stray bullet.
B:	just started shooting people  because they botched the first job
M:	right.
B:	and  so now they're going to get even.
M:	right.
B:	yeah.
M:	i mean you know
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	yeah.
M:	so it's it was really a tough issue but i think that uh you know you have to do you have a background check to make sure that you're buying something right and that you you don't you can't say that it's not authentic.
B:	so what was the verdict what was the results there.
M:	well the result was that uh the the defendant did not have a defense.
B:	oh.
M:	he was found not guilty of it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i don't i i'm not sure that that i mean i've heard it but i haven't you know i haven tought about it.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict.
M:	right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	yeah well you know you just have to decide you know well there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing.
M:	well that that would be a good idea.
B:	and that i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
M:	uh-uh. well i uh
B:	uh-huh
M:	i i think that's probably one of the worst things i've ever seen happen.
B:	uh-huh. yeah. well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. i mean i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but it it's not worth somebody getting executed for. but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
M:	well it can be. it can be it really can be a a very very bad thing. i think that uh
B:	and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
M:	yeah.
B:	and so i go these are the kind of people i would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society.
M:	that's right.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
