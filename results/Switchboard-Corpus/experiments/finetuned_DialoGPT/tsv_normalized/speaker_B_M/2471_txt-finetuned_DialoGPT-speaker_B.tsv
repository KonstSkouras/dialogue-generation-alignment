B:	uh-huh. well that's
M:	but i don't know. i think uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i don't know i there's a lot of things that could be done about it. i mean i don tinker around with it too much.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. i i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world and so uh there's a lot of money to be made there and it's uh be very difficult to to cut it back to a a level where it should be.
M:	uh i uh i think uh uh we we have to do something. we have to uh.
B:	and and uh it will come back to haunt us it seems to come in cycles.
M:	yeah that's true.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	right.
M:	and then we have a a uh a real resentment of the united states toward mexico and i think that's uh.
B:	right and the probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the that's the drug entry points
M:	uh-uh. uh-hue.
B:	and their economy is of several of the countries especially columbia is so built on the on on the drugs that uh our our little war on drugs has really been laughable. it's just a you know such a small amount and it it just it uh cuts off just a trickle and uh if if we can't get a handle on that through some through some uh method i don't know where that will be another big problem.
M:	yeah.
B:	right right.
M:	so it's it is it really is and i i you you can see it in some of the in some in the uh in some areas of the country where they have to pay for their own land but you don't see it you're right it doesn't it isn't really a government thing.
B:	and as long as we're the largest uh consumer then uh this is the market.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that oh yeah i i used to think that was the market but uh.
B:	if we can cut back the usage then uh maybe it will have to go someplace else.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. uh-huh yeah.
M:	you know it's it it really is a a change.
B:	we're just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up
M:	right.
B:	and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises.
M:	uh uh-hue uh.
B:	yeah. that's right. our own hemisphere but we've that's been uh that's been the way it's always been.
M:	uh yeah.
B:	so uh
M:	well i think that uh
B:	very much so except when we need them. you know when they found oil in mexico then we got very friendly with them again.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh.
B:	um.
M:	and uh i guess uh  we're probably going to see a lot more of that.
B:	okay.
M:	okay well i think that um i i don't know i just i feel that that you know that the the police should uh be more involved in their handling of the problem.
B:	sure did.
M:	and i i just felt that it was it was important to me to have some background knowledge on what was going on.
B:	always yes ma'am.
M:	and uh i i don't know i think that that uh you know we need to just uh uh go ahead and let these people go and let them go.
B:	you too dear.
M:	thank you.
B:	bye.
