B:	yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	yeah. and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them. because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know.
M:	right right.
B:	well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people. you know who would see it.
M:	right.
B:	yeah but i'm not sure how successful that is.
M:	i think it's mostly a deterrent but uh.
B:	quicker  maybe yeah.
M:	but i i guess it would have to be expedient.
B:	uh-huh. what what kind of work do you do?
M:	uh i work at a university.
B:	um well see i'm a school principal.
M:	uh.
B:	elementary school.
M:	oh okay.
B:	and in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo kids. and i see kids already that are going to be criminals in spite of everything we can do
M:	uh-huh. uh-hum.
B:	and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that i mean course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there
M:	uh-huh.
B:	but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids we'd have fewer decisions to make. down the road you know.
M:	yeah.
B:	oh yeah.
M:	uh the the school system in dallas is so rundown and you just can't seem to get around the system.
B:	well i'm not talking about just in the school system.
M:	right right.
B:	see i'm talking about like in in uh i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared. uh i know the institutions don't work that well but a bad day because i all these kids through my office. i have a school of five hundred and thirty-seven kids.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	five hundred of them are good solid kids and i have the same thirty-seven in my office every day.
M:	yeah.
B:	and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible. some of them in the penal system.
M:	yeah.
B:	and you know you just see those kids going down the road. now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers. and that kind of thing
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and if we had something to do before they get to be full-blown adult criminals and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	i think that's one reason we have problems in schools uh and some of them are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we are supposed to do.
M:	yeah.
B:	but that's another subject but
M:	yeah i think it's a it's it really is a problem.
B:	anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody has making a decision what to do with them.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh. i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be. it would be money better spent than
M:	yeah.
B:	do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard? that's true.
M:	no i'm sure it's not.
B:	statistically that's true.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but i think it would be an appropriate punishment.
B:	are you for it?
M:	i am for it.
B:	i'm for it in  in some cases.
M:	i don't know.
B:	yeah.
M:	and i think it's important that we decide what we want to do.
B:	what kind of crimes would you use it for?
M:	well i think it would be pretty severe you know you'd have to be a little bit dense to understand.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	i think there should be some statute of limitations on uh appeals.
B:	i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going. you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children.
M:	uh.
B:	well you know somebody elected that recently.
M:	uh-uh. yeah.
B:	and all the civil rights people are up arms about it you know.
M:	yeah.
B:	but uh
