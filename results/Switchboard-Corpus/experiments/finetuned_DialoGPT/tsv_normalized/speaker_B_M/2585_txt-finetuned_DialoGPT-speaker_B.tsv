B:	uh-huh.
M:	you you don't see the violence inherent in the people that are running around and you can't blame them. you know i i think that's a a big problem.

M:	but uh they're doing real well and uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh i don't know it just i just don't see that that that you can do much about it.
B:	and not being cared for.
M:	right. and that's the way it's going now.
B:	yeah. that's true.
M:	and i think uh.
B:	well what did you do when you helped these people?
M:	!!! remindme!! = did you help these people when they were children or
B:	how did you what did you do
M:	i helped them with their homework.
B:	all right.
M:	i was just i was helping them learn how to speak their own language.
B:	uh-huh uh-huh. uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	well i'm an e s l teacher.
M:	oh you are?
B:	yes.
M:	and i teach in a school system
B:	i got my certification. but actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
M:	right.
B:	i mean it's like people don't know what they say
M:	uh well that that is true.
B:	it's not step for step.
M:	and i think you know they they probably don't want us to to say oh you're a good gardener you do this you must do this.
B:	yeah
M:	but i i think that's one thing that i think we've come to to expect in the future
B:	but anyway i enjoy it. they they the kids i've worked with so far have been spanish speaking.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and
M:	well that's neat.
B:	but i'm applying for what? yeah it is.
M:	it's spanish.
B:	a lot of our words are the same
M:	yeah.
B:	like you know  they just change the pronunciation a little bit.
M:	right. right.
B:	but i love it. i love the culture uh the way that they uh they respect education and their teachers their parents so much more than than my children do. you know
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and i like it. and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh asian center that a doctor falk has started that works with the school district.
M:	uh that's wonderful.
B:	and doing what trying to get them set up inculturated  into the system.
M:	right.
B:	i thought that would be good experience for me.
M:	yeah.
B:	and i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian.
M:	yeah.
B:	and i think that would be wonderful too.
M:	yeah.
B:	right.
M:	so that that's a real negative i think.
B:	well the times were different too.
M:	oh yeah.
B:	my neighbor let's see is jewish. and he's going through the i don't know the jewish league or something. and helping a family that's come over from russia.
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family  and help them with the language.
M:	oh uh uh.
B:	and he thoroughly enjoyed it.
M:	oh that's great.
B:	no.
M:	i don't know.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	uh-huh. what's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but  their training isn't what we need in this country.
M:	right.
B:	and because they're so deficient in english they haven't been able to get jobs.
M:	right.
B:	so they'll have to go back and get a degree here. you know almost start all over.
M:	that's true.
B:	no no. and this woman was uh stocking the shelves in a drugstore.
M:	oh my.
B:	i feel sorry for her.
M:	!!!%!! remind me.
B:	well thank you.
M:	all right.
B:	have a good night.
