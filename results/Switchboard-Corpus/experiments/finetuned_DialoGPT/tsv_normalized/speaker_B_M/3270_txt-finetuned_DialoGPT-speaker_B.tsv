B:	um
M:	and uh
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh.
B:	oh which state is that?
M:	that's alaska.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh so i i was real disappointed in it. i thought it was a really good movie but i thought they were trying too hard to go all the way.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	right. right.
M:	and uh.
B:	yep. right.
M:	uh i mean it's it was a little uh little over a hundred dollars over two years.
B:	yeah.
M:	but it's just a it's not a very good idea.
B:	yeah. definitely i think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
M:	yeah and i don't know i i don tinker with it too much but i uh i it's it seems to me that there is a a tremendous amount of waste.
B:	i mean there was um people at stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to uh for the president to buy beach homes or whatever it was.
M:	right.
B:	and i think that that maybe more widespread than well than we'd like to have think.
M:	yeah.
B:	but but then it's something that's hard to enforce too i'm sure.
M:	yeah.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	right.
M:	so i don't know it's it seems to me that that uh.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	but uh i'm not really sure that uh.
B:	well that's right. uh i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste
M:	uh
B:	but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
M:	i don't know what what uh.
B:	i mean when you look at something like the gulf war it cost us god knows how much. you know at a million dollars a pop for patriot missiles.
M:	yeah.
B:	yeah.
M:	but i don think it's really been a great help at all.
B:	right. uh-huh.
M:	and uh.
B:	uh-huh. right.
M:	i think that um.
B:	okay all right. you too.
