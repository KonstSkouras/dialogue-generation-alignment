B:	uh-huh.
M:	so i i thought well i'll try that.
B:	uh i didn't think that was a new revelation.
M:	well it was.
B:	right. so what what is the e p a recommending now?
M:	well e p a has been doing a lot of uh you know a lot more research and uh and they have they have really really uh...
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and uh the e s p a was the one that said that they should have been more involved with the war.
B:	yeah.
M:	and uh they were saying that uh the waste is not being recycled. it's being burned.
B:	right. that's a that's a common problem though. that it seems that has happened in dallas as well as new york and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose.
M:	yeah i've i'm not a real big fan of the newspaper either.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	and they're trying to start putting the recycling in the in the bins out front and and the like.
B:	right.
M:	and uh.
B:	well that's good.
M:	so
B:	right. there has to be uh a reuse for it. i mean that's why they recycle. the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
M:	uh-huh.
B:	and uh i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
M:	uh they have those in the uh  in the parks.
B:	uh-huh.
M:	so he went in and and he got the engineering major and he proved that that he could do it by just using the engineering degree.
B:	oh really.
M:	!!!%!! remind me of that
B:	right.
M:	but uh
B:	huh.
M:	so i i think that's the major uh change is that uh.
B:	well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but what  what about emissions?
M:	uh yeah. well i don't know how they would how they'd do it with gasoline. i guess they'd have to burn it
B:	oh.
M:	and and he didn tinker with it. he he tinker but but he didn you know it it was it got it wasn't it didn't get anywhere near what he was trying to do.
B:	okay
M:	well what do you think of uh the space shuttle landing?
B:	no. well it's interesting. i bet that was a good day at the yeah conference then.
M:	yeah i bet it was.
B:	did it change anything for you?
M:	no not really because i've had it for you know i've been in this for i guess about three years now.
