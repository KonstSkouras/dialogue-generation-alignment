B:	Oh, definitely.
M:	Uh, I just feel like, you're not, you don't feel like you're getting what you need, and you're paying, you've got to pay for it, and I, you have to pay the bills, and it's just, I think, I really feel like I'm being, I'm not being smart, and not being consistent, and paying, and so, I feel like that's a big, uh...
B:	Right. Yeah, yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, yeah, that's, that is a good one.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
M:	I think, I think that, uh.
B:	Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. My only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government, I don't know
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Do they wind up with more red tape, and more problems then? Yeah, yeah.
M:	Well, it's, it, it seems like it's just going to take, uh, a lot of time.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They don't have to worry about spending the money to send people there to learn how to shoot their own weapons.
B:	Oh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Wow.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah. Well, I think part of the, the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money, until, you know, they have no preventative measures People, um, you know, just go on and on and on. I mean, so many people don't even get prenatal care or, and it just extends with if it, what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous, you know, burden on the taxpayers. They're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, you know
M:	And I think that's probably a big factor.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I'm, I'm very much aware of that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	uh, I think that, uh-hugh, it's time that we take steps to, to correct it.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	because they, they don't have the time to, to look after themselves.
B:	Oh, it's unbelievable how much you go through. When I just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan, and, I mean, a chiropractor got it in one time
M:	Oh.
B:	it was just strange.
M:	I don't know, I just, I don't think there's a day that we can do everything in the world.
B:	Oh, well, that should help.
M:	Yeah, that will help, uh.
B:	Yeah
M:	I know, I know that, uh-huh.
B:	Oh I see Oh, gosh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Okay, well
M:	Well it's good talking to you.
B:	Okay, thank you. Bye-bye
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Auto attacks.
