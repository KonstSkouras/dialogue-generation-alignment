B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and so I started that, and, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I found that I really liked my weight and I was getting, getting better all the time, so I decided to stay on that, and I'm, I don't know, I just feel better now that I'm on a program.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I guess, uh.
B:	Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, ,
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	Okay.
M:	!!!%!! animation!!>!! Remind me!!?!!That's the one where they have the, uh they have a, they have like a dance routine.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I do a lot more aerobatics when I'm doing it than I do weight lifting.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, I've been doing this for probably two months now.
B:	Well, uh, okay. Now that's inside again, right?
M:	Yeah, right.
B:	But,
M:	so.
B:	Do, do you like to do it with other people. I mean like the, the jazzercise would be?
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, I think it's kind of strange that people walk, you know, like you said, walking on ringside
B:	Right.
M:	and so I really enjoy that. But, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to do that.
B:	But,
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah, right. Right. But still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.
M:	Right. And, uh,
B:	In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I, I, I don't know. I, uh, I've never had to do it, you know, because I've, I just, I haven't had to get ahold of one.
B:	Yeah, uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah it does.
B:	I, I've, one thing, when, when I have run and jogged, uh, I've always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, not with the sense that it was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do, I, I've really enjoyed just the activity and, uh, I write software, uh, as far as the job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. The, it's
M:	Yeah I,
B:	The the the change of pace and just  getting out and around
M:	Yeah
B:	and I find that I can often, you know, often, uh, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work
M:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working and I, I go back and I've got new ideas, but still .
M:	Uh, I've had a lot of good experiences with, uh uh, home repair, too, and, uh  and home repair.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I do enjoy it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I know, I, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know, I, I guess I'm kind of in a, in a dilemma, you know, with it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but I don't want to do it now.
B:	Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, demanding the time for yourself. That you've just got to   you've just got to
M:	Yeah
B:	Right.
M:	You know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Well good, well good. Well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging? I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, uh, club.
M:	No, I haven't.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	so I just try to, you know, do as much as I can.
