M:	Yeah.
B:	And I pay a lot of property taxes.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I don't have any, um, I don't, you know, I don't use an awful lot of city services. It, it, you know it's like I have to work I have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, um, there's so many people who want a, a of the federal money or the state money or whatever it is
M:	Uh.
B:	and I just, sometimes, many times I end up feeling like I'm paying too much in taxes.
M:	Yeah.
B:	How about you? Do you pay too much?
M:	Well, I don't know, I guess I, I pay too little in taxes, but I,
B:	Well, when you  when you go out into the, uh, when you go out into the working world it, it changes quickly.
M:	Yeah, it does.
B:	Um, you look at your paycheck and you go, oh, my gosh where did it all go Um, what kind of, what kind of, uh, well have you pay a lot of in have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you, did you go directly from high school into, into college?

M:	Uh, not really, I don't really know. I, uh
B:	I, uh, I haven't done any of that type of work myself.
M:	Oh, you haven't?
B:	Um, but every once in a while when I hear up here at, at, uh, in D C area, um, one of the radio stations has been talking about the, the Congress, um, Congress has added too towards the Members Bank there, you know, there's a bank that they all bank with, and I guess it went defunct recently.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	And one of the Congressmen has, has written in the last three years about a thousand bad checks.
M:	Oh, I didn't know that.
B:	And we, we the taxpayers float him a loan for all all those bad checks,  no interest, no repayment schedule.
M:	Right.
B:	And, um, it's causing quite a stir up here,  because we're so close to D C anyway.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur.
M:	Well, I'm not sure what the status of the loan is.
B:	Um, I, I, I think we pay too much. And I've, I look at my paycheck and I make, well, let's see. They take out in state and federal taxes
M:	Uh,
B:	I think I pay forty-two percent.
M:	Uh, that's, that is a lot.
B:	Forty-two cents out of every dollar I make goes to the government, and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes,
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	and they charge me all these others, and it's just too expensive.
M:	I know.

B:	You know what I mean?
M:	I know.
B:	Do you, have you used, um, student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government?
