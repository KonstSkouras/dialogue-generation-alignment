B:	Yeah,
M:	Oh, I was just wondering that.
B:	actually through electronic mail.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right. So it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away,  at, at this point
M:	Right, right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, it's, it, it is a real problem.
B:	Well, um, I'm research stuff here now so what they, they have, uh, um, okay, benefits package. It's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant, um, benefits here is that you can take, uh, up to two courses a semester, um, and they pay for you know, pay for the classes.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	So,  that works out to be, um, a reasonable, a reasonable benefit.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, um
B:	If you want to,  do it quickly.
M:	and you're not allowed to take your kids out at night.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I don't know in, in terms of other things, other benefits other than sort of monetary I'd, you know, I, Yeah, we, we do. We have to contribute a certain amount, uh, to it.
M:	Right.
B:	And it's kind of split between C M U and,  and, you know, the employee.
M:	Right.
B:	Right. Yeah, and it's also, right now it's, uh, the, like everywhere else, uh, here in Pittsburgh the health care, uh, rates are, are going up pretty quickly.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's a whole other topic to begin with too but. Yeah, but it's, you are right. I, I, I really agree that, that that's pretty important.
M:	Well, that, uh  that's, that makes a big difference.
B:	Right.
M:	And I don't have a real big problem with, with it.
B:	Right. Uh-huh Oh Now that's a big win.
M:	Yeah, it really is.
B:	Yeah, yeah. That's,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know if you got the Texas or not, but I've got the book.
B:	Yeah. I figured for and they've just raised the, um, income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty, you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying paying that as well.
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah That's true.
B:	Yeah, well if you could call it a benefit that C M U, I mean the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is, is consult for, um, you know, other companies.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um, so that's, that kind of helps out in terms of,  you know, keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry.
M:	Right.
B:	You know, in case,  you know, in case you ever need to bail out
M:	Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh you know they, uh they have, uh  they have these, uh uh, they have those sets that you can paint over.
