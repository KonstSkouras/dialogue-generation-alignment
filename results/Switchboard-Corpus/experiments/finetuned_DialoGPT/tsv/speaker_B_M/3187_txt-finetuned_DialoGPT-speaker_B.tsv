B:	Um, well, the, see, uh, well, we, he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
M:	Uh.
B:	right, we wound up just choosing a, another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into. Or but naturally, no, it was even Mennonite related, I'm sorry, it was actually not a particularly great nursing home. Mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it, because he suddenly got sick  and needed to be put in.
M:	Uh-huh. Oh, that's, that sounds awful
B:	Uh, what do you think?
M:	Well, I, I don't think that, uh  nursing homes are safe.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we made a point of doing that. She had been in a, a nursing homes before, but she has now, um.
B:	Yeah.
M:	so she had to make that decision on her own
B:	Yeah
M:	and so, uh, I went in there and I was so happy to find that and, uh  she had, uh
B:	yeah, that's important I would say.
M:	Yeah. Yeah, I, I would, I really think so, because it's important for your, uh, your family and for your future, too.
B:	Okay.
M:	and, uh, she is able to, to do that, and it's very convenient because, you know, she has a private baby-sitter that, you can just trust her with whatever she decides, you, she will do it,
B:	Yeah.
M:	and she was very, very concerned about me,
B:	Right, and that becomes difficult then.
M:	It really is.
B:	Uh-huh. Yep, we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life, but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he lived in his own house as long as he could
M:	Uh.
B:	but he was living alone, had an upstairs apartment, could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain,
M:	Uh.
B:	and this, eventually things just went too far
M:	Yeah, that's, that was my mother living with me, and I was just, you know, I was in a, a situation where my mother was in an apartment and, uh, you could see her crying,
B:	and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home.
M:	Yeah, that's, that would be a nightmare.
B:	Right
M:	and she's, she's gone through a period of depression, and she's had to find a good home and, and, uh, take care of herself and everything.
B:	well that's, yeah, that's right that the children have some responsibility, too, to their parents and such, to help decide what's the right thing.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And.
M:	and, uh, she was really good, but I, I, you know, I just, I don't think that, that, uh that we have to, you, you have to be so totally convinced that, you're, you can't do everything on her every day.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and she doesn't have to be there during the day, she can just go right down the hallway and sit, and and, and, you know,
B:	Yep.
M:	!!!%
