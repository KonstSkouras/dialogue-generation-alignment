M:	What, what does it mean?
B:	Exactly, yeah, um,
M:	It doesn't seem like it's as hard on the joints as it is on the, uh.
B:	yeah, fluid resistance.
M:	Yeah, that's, that, that was one of the big selling points of the new aerobics equipment.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. How about you?
M:	Well, um I'm in graduate school right now so I, I'm not,
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	so I don't, I don relate to that at all.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you, do you kind of think it's a chore, or do you enjoy it?
M:	Well, I do enjoy it. Uh, I, I think it is a lot of work.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm a little bit more, uh, refined, I guess I'd say.
B:	Uh-huh. Sure, yeah.
M:	and so I, I try to, I do a lot more planning when I'm with my children, you see.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah. Uh, I, um, I used to, uh, I used to weigh, uh, two hundred fifteen pounds, and now I weigh only about one, about one seventy-five. Um, so I drastically had to change the way I ate when I, when I first moved to college, and, uh, I had started weight lifting quite regularly, and so I got my weight down, and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, uh, you know, when I'm not fat like I used to be  I don't worry about it
M:	Yeah.
B:	, yeah.
M:	and, uh  you know.
B:	Uh-huh. Although lately I have noticed, you know, even if I gain, like two pounds, I start, I start feeling it and,
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I know, I know. I'm, I'm a little bit surprised. I was, I was thinking, you, you'd think you'd get more from exercise, you would get more out of it.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah, there are. Um, I'm living in a dorm right now, and so right downstairs there's a facility. And I really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than I do because there's a facility right downstairs where all, you know, all we have to do is, is, uh, run down there
M:	Uh-uh. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh yeah, I really do, because I like to get, you know, get off alone and just do that for a while, but that's hard, you know.
M:	Well, I know, I, I do too, but I'm so, I mean, I don't enjoy it at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	you have to get yourself in a position where you can relax a little bit.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, so, you're right. I think it's just, I think the, the, I don't know, I guess the most significant thing that I think we've done in this, this past few years is, um, I've been involved in, in, uh uh, international campaigns.
B:	Exactly.
M:	and I don t want to do it.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.
M:	and I need to, I need something to do, I've got to get up early in the morning and do that.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, ready to go another twelve hours. Yeah, yeah.
M:	So you don't have to be in shape for school either.
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly?
M:	Uh, yeah, yeah I don't, I don, I mean I don've, I haven't been doing that, I guess I stopped subscribing, uh, about, probably about a year and a half ago.
B:	Uh-huh. I stopped eating meat about, oh, uh, must have been eight months ago.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	Uh-huh, completely. I mean, any kind of meat or, and I, and I really feel a lot better now.
M:	!!!%
B:	Yeah, it really does.
M:	Really does. I know that my husband used to eat a lot more beef than he does now. He used to, but he, he doesn't anymore.
B:	Uh-huh, yeah, that's it, I mean, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
M:	Uh, I don't know, I guess I'm, I'm more, I think I'm eating more chicken than I am,
B:	and so. I found that really helps.
M:	Yeah, that sounds good.
B:	Yeah, I eat that, I think I've eaten fish like twice since. I used to eat a lot of fish, too, but I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	Yeah, and I like it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know if I'm that brave yet .
M:	No, I, I'm not brave, I just have a very good handle on it. I, uh, I try to keep it on a minimum amount of foods that I can, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And I just don't like it, so I don't,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I like to have a salad.
B:	Okay, yeah, it sounds good.
M:	It was nice talking with you.
B:	Well, good luck to you there in Idaho.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me. Okay.
B:	Well, I'm in graduate school now. I, I, I kind of feel like I wish I could have gone back to undergraduate now
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, it is. Well, it's good talking,
M:	Well it was nice talking to you.
B:	Pardon? I'm studying speech pathology.
M:	Oh, okay.
