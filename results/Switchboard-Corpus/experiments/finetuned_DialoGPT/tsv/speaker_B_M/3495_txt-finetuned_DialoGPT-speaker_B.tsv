M:	But, uh.
B:	It, it, it's pretty bad here, too.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, we have, uh
B:	We've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff. In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, that, that Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh, I think, uh
B:	Yeah, it's, it's really, it's, and I've seen in more in Durham than I have in Raleigh or, or or Chapel Hill.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever. I mean, it's kind of, I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it, but it has a pretty low crime rate. Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the worst. They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And over half of it has been drug related.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, I mean I, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You know, people, people get older and they, they get out of it.
B:	Well, that, and the, and the economy is so bad and, And so many people have been laid off and stuff.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	They've done special stories on the news, local news here.
M:	!!!% Well, I've heard stories.
B:	We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff. I know, like a week or so ago, I live in a, in a town house, which is, you know, it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work, she came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures, everything. And nobody thought any different, they just thought she was moving. It was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole everything she owned
M:	Uh,
B:	Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad
M:	Well what else do we like to have?
B:	Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the neighborhood because there is always somebody at home
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we all know one another and, and, on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that.
M:	Uh.
B:	It's, I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over here.
M:	Oh, are you really?
B:	Most people are, are, retired or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in their forties or, or whatever. So and I'm in my twenties, so I, I'm, I'm out more than they are, but they're at home at night,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	so I really don't worry about anything.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I, and I don't think that, uh, there's much that can be done about it.
B:	Yeah, see, that's the same thing here.
M:	And I think that's going to be one of the major changes. I think, I, I don't know, I do feel like, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And we have a lot of, uh a lot more single family homes and a lot fewer single family families.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I don't know, I just, I guess I just feel like there's a need to be more of that sort of, uh
