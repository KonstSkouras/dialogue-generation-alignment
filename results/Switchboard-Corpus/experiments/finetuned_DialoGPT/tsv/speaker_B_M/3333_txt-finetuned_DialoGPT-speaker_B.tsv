B:	Oh
M:	So I called support.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I just thought that was really neat.
B:	I think five minutes is the max.
M:	Oh.
B:	Oh, I don't know.
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	Right, especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex, you know, there's so much going on here.
M:	Right.
B:	Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and,
M:	And it's, it's getting, I mean, it, it really is.
B:	No, I, not that I'm aware of.
M:	Well, I know, I just heard something on the news about that, but I, I'm not sure what the circumstances surrounding it.
B:	I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, um,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Is that right?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
M:	So, um.
B:	I know
M:	But, uh, I mean there are a lot of kids that are just out of high school that, you know
B:	I know, it's, it's, it's getting, it's been out of hand, I think, for a while, and it just continues to get worse.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, they've got to have the help.
B:	Right.
M:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah, that's, I I agree, I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that may impact it as well.
M:	Right, and I think, you're right, I, I know that, uh
B:	Right, right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah
M:	and yet they can be so easily ruined
B:	they don't think twice about it. Yeah. Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,
M:	Yeah, I think that's probably true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I, I, I'm not sure.
B:	You're kidding.
M:	so.
B:	Himself and her?
M:	yeah, well they're, uh they're married now, but they, uh their marriage was so highly publicized that, uh uh, I was surprised that, you know, I never heard any press about it.
B:	Oh, wow, I bet.
M:	and, uh,
B:	Oh, I know,
M:	and you wouldn tinker with it,
B:	Well, they were, I was watching some show the other day, and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently, and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	Right, and then you get to their life story, Oh, they came from a broken family
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	oh this person had mental problems
M:	Uh.
B:	oh duh, duh, duh you know,
M:	Yeah, yeah, I know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh, you know they, they, uh they do it to themselves.
B:	Is that right?
M:	Yeah, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and she was just, she just had this, this wonderful, wonderful body and, and I think her mind was just about as clear as a sandwhich as a milkhouse.
B:	Uh, I remember seeing that,
M:	and, uh, she just, you know, you could tell she was really struggling,
B:	I saw that on Hard Copy
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yes.
M:	and I think that's one of the reasons that we, we need to do more of that.
B:	Is that right?
M:	And, uh.
B:	I'm trying to remember, he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and he just shot them himself and her.
M:	Oh, gosh.
B:	I remember seeing that.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, there's just too many crazy people out there these days.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I think that's the way it is. I think they just want to make it a little bit more convenient for people to do that. I don't know, I just, I don tinker around with it a bit.
