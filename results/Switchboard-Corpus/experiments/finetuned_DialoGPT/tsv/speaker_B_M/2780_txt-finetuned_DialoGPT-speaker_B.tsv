B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh I don't know, I mean, I'm, I've seen it, I don know, in some of these, uh in some, in certain areas in certain counties.
B:	Uh, well, of course, you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, she said that, uh that she had a gun at her house,
B:	Well, it's very true, now I'm a, uh, New Yorker by birth.
M:	Uh, uh-hope.
B:	Although I claim Florida as my home now, uh, I have two sons living down there but I also have two sons living elsewhere,  one in Tennessee, one in Mississippi.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	But I lived in in Florida for ten years and I kind of like it down there, but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I think uh, well in your words, they were a little bit too liberal.
M:	Right.
B:	I mean they they I believe if I'm correct I believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	But they uh quickly did away with it.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	I think in the next session they they uh modified it but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	The the one week uh seven day the delay
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh huh.
M:	And you have to register with the gun club and all that.
B:	Well I don't mind that too much
M:	Yeah.
B:	I'm I'm with the N R A myself.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Auto attacks or something.
B:	And uh, uh Really the only objection we have Is uh you you give a little and next thing you know somebody's trying to take more.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and I don't know if you have any strong opinions on that or not, but I, I do, I have a strong opinion that, uh, that, that the death penalty is, is a, is an over use of the death row.
B:	Well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal?
M:	Well, I, I think, uh, the way the courts are set up now, I don't know if I would call myself a liberal but I think that the way they process the appeal process is, is, uh you know, uh
B:	Well let me ask you this then.
M:	I think, I think that, uh, we've come a long way in the, in the making of a better country.
B:	How is your what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag?
M:	Well, I'm pretty, I don't like burning the flag, but I do respect the right to freedom of speech and I do, I think that, uh, burning of the flag is, uh
B:	Huh.
M:	I mean, you know, it's just, it just doesn't, I mean, it doesn't really matter. I mean it's, you, you've got to draw a line somewhere.
B:	Well now wait a minute there
M:	But I don't know if you're ready to go
B:	you just said it. It's their right by freedom of speech? What does speech have to do with burning a flag?
M:	Right.
B:	Now uh Well I I still go back to ...
M:	Okay, what do you think about the war recently?
B:	Then would you condone the burning of the capitol building?
M:	Well I, I would have to say no. I, uh, I think it's the, uh the best, uh I don't know, uh situation I've ever had to deal with, uh uh, uh in, uh political situations is that, uh we, uh have to, uh be, I guess I've been involved in a civil war, uh  for, uh a period of time.
B:	Uh, then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol.
M:	Right. Right.
B:	Uh yeah
M:	And I, I think I agree with that.
B:	but here again I go back to the second amendment You can disagree by freedom of speech which, has nothing to do with action.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Now I am I am adamantly against that.
M:	Uh-hum.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they keep fighting each other and I think that's just what they need to do and I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon.
B:	huh.
M:	and that is what is, uh, what is keeping the United States from, uh uh, having a revolution.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	But I don't think you have to be a complete lunatic to, to, uh, follow the scriptural principals.
B:	No.
M:	and I think, I think you're right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I don't know what I'd do if it was someone I knew was oppressing me. But, I mean, it's just, I think I would be scared to death of my own family, you know.
B:	Well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself.
M:	No. Not at all.
B:	Nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country.
M:	Uh-uh. That's right.
B:	Uh, um so long as it's their possession. Ok, you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh, what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I used to know as a Boy Scout but all I remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country, and to maintain it.
M:	Oh, uh-huh.
B:	And, to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I don t mind if they're going to get convicted of, uh, you know, sexual offenses and stuff like that and I don think that they should be allowed to, you can't, you could not sentence them to life without possibility of parole.
B:	It's It's very easy to do.
M:	Uh, and I think that's one thing that's good about it is that, uh, you don't have to be so, uh-honed out, you know,
B:	Uh Uh-huh.
M:	You know, I mean I think that's one of those things that, you know, it's sort of like supporting animal rights. You know, you support animal rights but you don't, you don tinker with it or you don, you, you sort of, you're against it.
B:	Well I think it should be permitted under certain
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh. Well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human?
M:	Well, I, I know that I have heard, uh, uh
B:	Huh.
M:	And, uh, I think, I mean I don t understand the idea of the father or the mother being the one who ultimately decides what's going to happen.
B:	Or they on their within the own uh society, it can vary.
M:	Yeah. Well, it's, it, it seems to me that, uh, that it's just, it was a convenient way to get away from having to go through so many generations of, of, uh uh, of history before you could really say, well, you know, you can't have it any more
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's, it, it is interesting that, uh, the, the news, uh.
