B:	and I think they're better people because of it,
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	they're much more responsible. I know, um, the church that I go to, um, the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen, you know,
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	they're encouraged to do that, missionary work, and I I really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our, society better.
M:	Uh, I don't know if that's true, or not.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I was very comfortable with the kids, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I've always felt that, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, it's, it is interesting that, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, I don't know, it's just that I don, I think it's, it seems to me that, uh you know, in general the, the news is sensationalized and, and I don'y know why. I think sometimes it's not.
B:	Huh.
M:	But I think I'm going to have to do that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	so I'm, you, you're not going to have any money left over when you retire, you'll have to pay them off,
B:	Huh. and rattling in
M:	Yeah, it says anywhere from six months to two years, and that's what they look for.
B:	Yes. Yes.
M:	I think that's a wonderful idea. Um, I'm, I work in the Waco area and, um, we're planning to move there in the next couple of years,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And he said that they were going to rebuild the whole thing. And I was like, no, no.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I think so, it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school, um, there's kind of a selfishness,
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	I mean, teenagers in our country are kind of, kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and, and things like that
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that it would help people to become, less self-centered, and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to, um, thinking less of your own needs but, of other people.
M:	Uh, I would agree with that. Uh, and I think, I mean, I, I don't know, I guess I'm a little too old fashioned, but I don, I I don 't mind when I go out and do things myself, I just don't like to have to mess with it, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, you don't have to be, you can't be self-employed and not have a budget, you have to have some kind of budget, and I think it's really important to be able to do things like this.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And it was like the only thing that I ever taught was assembly
B:	Oh, no.
M:	And, um.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they were just playing board games and this and that, you, you would see them all in the same room, you never could decide which one you wanted to play on.
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	Um, you, you see, I don't know. I think that maybe the schools could do a better job of teaching the kids in the region, you're right.
B:	Yes.
M:	I think, I don't know, I'm sure that, uh, a lot of things we have to solve are not solutions to the problem.
B:	It would really, um, and I don't the people that I've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are, they do military service which, you know, I don't exactly recommend
M:	Uh,
B:	but still they have benefited from it.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	And, um, you know, although I wouldn't want it to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's, it has helped them
M:	Uh-hums.
B:	and they are just a lot more mature, than the average student
M:	Yeah.
B:	and like she's washing
M:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I think they did a really good job of that.
B:	Well, that's right. A lot of people they flunk out or they get, they just get so excited to be away from home, they just spend all there time partying
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	and they do a lot of things to themselves that, that we really don't want our young people to be doing
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	and,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Um.
M:	Well, I, I don't know, I guess it's a matter of, uh, of, of different priorities, I suppose.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, you can, you could say you're probably right, that, that the, uh the government's probably not doing itself any good, and that there's probably other problems that, uh
B:	because we're so, we love our freedom and our freedom of choice and, um, having people like
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	But, you know, our, like in our church, it, it is, your free to do that or not
M:	Uh.
B:	you're encouraged to do it because, um, you know, it, it helps you, and, of course, we think it's helping other people.
M:	Uh, yeah, I think it is.
B:	And so,
M:	I think it, and I think, and it's sad, because, you see so many young people that are in trouble, and so many people that, you don't even know it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I think that it's a big problem.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	!!!!,!!;!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	And they're preoccupied with, drinking.
M:	Right, and they're, they're in a, in a mental institution.
B:	Uh-huh. And
M:	Yeah, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  I think it's, it's interesting that, that, uh...
B:	That's true. paper
M:	Uh, but I, uh.
B:	That's really true.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Well, I, I don't know how that would ever happen here but at least, um,
M:	Uh, I know, uh, uh I, my, my sister-in-law is a, uh a, a Vietnam veteran and she was in the, uh and it, I guess it was the, the theater or whatever, uh.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Well, I have seen a big change, I think, in high school kids that my relatives and friends, that, um, I know when I was in high school I had an idea of what I really wanted to do with what my, what I was going to study
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
B:	and at least I had some interest in, a lot of the youth that I come in contact with are, they say oh, I want to be a doctor, I want to be a lawyer. Why? Because they make a lot of money.
M:	Right.
B:	And they don't have a goal, they don't have a goal, they don't have an interest in their own field of study.
M:	That's true, that is true. I don't know what they call it in college. I think they call themselves institutions of like thirty or forty thousand or something like that.
B:	They're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash.
M:	That's true, that is true. That's true and, and, uh, you know, I think, uh and that's also true of, uh you know a lot, a whole lot of companies, you're right, a, a large percentage of people that are hired are, you get, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they're all,
B:	Yes.
M:	I mean, I don't know, it, it seems ridiculous. I mean, you know, what's the solution.
B:	There's just too many people. Uh-huh. That's right. Not enough people want to do that to, for, uh, because of a service that they could provide.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah. I think it's, it's a shame that there's so many people who are uninsured and can't afford to get a, to get treatment and to be able to get help.
B:	You know, if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country, um, but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to, be rich.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, you know, it's not just the money that's available, it is the principle.
B:	That's kind of sad. Well, anyway.
M:	Okay.
B:	Well, I guess I better go.
M:	Okay.
B:	Well, good luck to you. I enjoyed it.
M:	All right.
B:	Thanks. Bye-bye.
