B:	whatever I'm doing, I watch that. I usually watch the news, either at, you know, early evening or at ten o'clock
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that.
B:	so I get it from T V a lot. I get TIME I read TIME MAGAZINE Um, that's one I read pretty regularly.
M:	Uh, well, that, that is one of my favorites, too.
B:	And, uh.  The thing about it, you know, now that I've found, is that we get such good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAGAZINE, there's nothing in it you don't know.
