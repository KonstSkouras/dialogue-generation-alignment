B:	And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.
M:	Well, that's true. I mean, it's, it, it is, it would be a big problem, I mean there are a lot of, a lot, a large number of guns out there.
B:	Yeah, it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, and, uh.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I, I think so, and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one, and, uh, and then, uh.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uh, I, I don, I mean, I know people that are, that are very avid gun owners. Uh, I'm not one of them. Uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I think that's, that's one of the problems that the police have identified as being the ones who are really out to get the guns.
B:	Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.
M:	But I don't know. I don, I donno, I think it would be a good idea. I, I, you, you've got to have the people who are, who are legitimate and, and legitimate, uh, right to, uh to have them, you got to be able to prove that you're a legitimate owner and, uh
B:	Yeah, and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh, and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, the way things are going.
M:	and, uh
B:	Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much, and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.
