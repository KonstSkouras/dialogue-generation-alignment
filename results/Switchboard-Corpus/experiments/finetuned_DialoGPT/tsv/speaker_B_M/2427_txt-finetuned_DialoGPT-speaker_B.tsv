B:	Yeah. I have two plots, one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a long skinny one and,
M:	!!!;!! RemindMe!!I'm trying to remember what that's called.
B:	Oh, I see. Yeah. I see.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Right. Right. Yeah, it's nice to get out in the open air.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And especially when the weather's not too hot or, not raining or whatever,
M:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh,  sometimes I,  I said, I sometimes I wish I had more space you know.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	I grow a lot of things, a lot of food.
M:	Uh-hauhuh, uh-hue.
B:	And sometimes I, I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant. Some of those things like, uh, you know, the things that vine like, uh, cucumbers, or, uh, squash or something,  like that.  Plant one of those
M:	Uh, Uh-uh. Uh, I see. Uh.
B:	and it takes up your whole space
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. They, they just run all over, the place, don't they,
M:	Yeah, they, they're real easy to grow.
B:	Right. Right.
M:	I don't know, it's, it just, I just think it's so much work, I don't, I, I'm glad I'm not the kind of person that does it, you, know,
B:	The basics. Right. Yeah. That's what we do too.
M:	I love to do, uh, like the, the, uh, like the French doors and stuff.
B:	Right. Peas
M:	And I like to keep them for a rainy season.
B:	I, I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	The first one, they started them indoors this time. I read it,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And so I,
M:	Well, it's, it was a real good movie.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	But, uh, sure is a heck of a lot of work.
M:	!!!%!!eting!! Remind me.
B:	Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I, I don't think I'll do it again
M:	Yeah, well, that's understandable.
B:	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I enjoy it. I come home from work and, and I usually say hello to wife and kids, and then go out and fiddle, you know, just walk around the yard and inspect it
M:	Uh-hue
B:	and the kids want to swing,
M:	Sure, sure. Well, I, we've, uh, had a couple of different things. One of them was that I was trying to decide what kind of paint to buy. I had this wonderful latex paint that I just, I just had not yet used.
B:	and I push them on swing.
M:	Sure, you got to get them down.
B:	And I I mow my own lawn.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I do, I don't have a sprinkler system. I, I don't enjoy watering.
M:	Well, I, uh, I grew up in Nebraska, and, uh.
B:	Especially,
M:	Well, that's, that, that sounds like you're, you're very good at it then.
B:	Oh how,
M:	and, uh, we've been real pleased with it.
B:	Oh.
M:	we've been in it like, I think, two years now.
B:	Yeah, you can have it come on just early in the morning. And, and off by the, you know, by the time you're up and about.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. I, I usually get it started for my wife
M:	Yeah
B:	and I, and she moves it around ever other day.
M:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I, you know, I don tinker with it too much.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I like to, uh I like the outdoors and I like having my house to look at, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, I didn't want to do it. I was tired of it.
B:	Yeah. Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, uh, chemical services to come, out and spray for weeds, and fertilize, and all that and take that one step out of .
M:	Yeah, and I don't know if you have that in your area. We have a real strict no smoking policy.
B:	But, uh, they want too much money.
M:	Uh, well, it's a problem that we've got here that if, if, you know, if we don't, we don tinker with the, the system, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right. Right. But it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.
M:	Oh, yeah, it's a lot cheaper.
B:	Right and the weed come up,
M:	Yeah. And, uh,
B:	and all of a sudden you've got to do something else.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I mean, I, I've had, I think, uh a couple of good ideas in the paper, and I'm not one of them,
B:	Well, if you,  enjoy it too, you know, you, you can get out in the morning when, before it gets hot and, and do it and stuff, when you only have to,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
M:	so.
B:	When the days start getting a little longer, you know, you can, I can start doing it in the evening after work.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	When they, when they switch to, switch,
M:	Yeah.
B:	when we get an hour more,
M:	Uh,
B:	when they rollback an hour.
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	I don't know.
M:	Okay.
B:	I really don't know. It just seems like I here it on the news the day before.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, I, I think it's coming up here soon.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	It's, uh.
B:	Are you having any trouble with bugs in, in your garden?
M:	Um, I'm, I've had some, some pretty, I don't know what kind of grass they are, but I've got a pretty good size porch, and, uh it's got, it's just about seventeen by twenty.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I use about three times as much as I should.
B:	Right. Right. I, I, it seems like they come in spurts.
M:	Yeah, they do.
B:	One year I didn't put anything on and I didn't have any problems.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage, cabbage loppers, or whatever.
M:	Oh, I know, I've seen those.
B:	They were just covered with them,
M:	Uh.
B:	I mean, I went up, I didn't go out there for about three days, you know, because I, and I went out there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem,
M:	Oh, no.
B:	they devoured it that quickly.
M:	Yeah, that's right, that, that was a really good movie.
B:	And, they, they, have a, you, a good appetite
M:	Right.
B:	And they would, you know, I, I picked off like twenty of them and,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	yeah.
M:	Yeah, and they just, they just kill everything, everything.
B:	They got that, uh, what is that safer soap, uh, B T spray this, year.
M:	Yeah, that's what it's called.
B:	And I've been watching them every day and I've, and I haven't seen any signs yet. So, if I see any signs I'm going to spray them,
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	and, uh,
M:	Well, that's, that, that is, that would be a good idea.
B:	Right.
M:	And it's like, uh-huh.
B:	Well, the good stuff. Right.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.!! translated!! translate!!if!! remind me!!ety!! translation!!two!!sv!!All!!all!!you!!?!!body!!They!!You!!It!!That!!Yeah!!We!!Well!!And!!Okay!!Do!! make!! presents!!I!!One!!Did!!Oh!!Yes!!Have!!
B:	Right. Yeah, my backyard is, uh, is sloping so I built a box up, you know had to build the one, the low side up.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, I had sandy loam hauled in. I had a dump truck come and dump it.
M:	Oh, no.
B:	On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do and then, I had to wheel barrow it in.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	But, uh, you know, you can improve your own soil there
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	but the Texas soil isn't the greatest, gardening soil.
M:	Uh, I'm not sure what the soil is like down there.
B:	Right. And you know, if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know what I mean
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Do you have, do you have a rotor tiller?
M:	No, I don't, but I do have one at work, and I have been wanting to get one at home, and, and so I thought, well, I'll just go ahead and get one and see what it looks like, you don't have to do that much work.
B:	Small enough, you have a, just do it by hand?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	How big is it?
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	But, uh,
B:	Yeah. I'd like to get one of these little small ones, that you see in all these gardening magazines.
M:	Uh-huh. Yeah, I, I'm not really into that too much. I'm more into the crafts and stuff.
B:	And it weighs twenty pounds or, something like that.
M:	Oh, that's great.
B:	My neighbor across the street has one. He always uses it to dethatch his lawn,
M:	Uh.
B:	I see him out there,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it.
M:	Uh.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Yeah, so that's, you know, it's not something that I would really have, you, I wouldn't have, uh, a, a need for, for a, you wouldn't, uh you wouldn tinker around with it or anything.
B:	I have a friend who has one and, and he lets me, you know, no problem borrowing if it's, just a hassle when you know, to go up
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's a fairly large one to, heave it up into the back of the van, bring it home and, check it back and just grab it, you know, if I, just go to my garage and grab it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	That would be nice.
M:	And, uh, I, I don't know, I think I'd like to have the, the automatic, you can have the seat belts on, on the door.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, and so, I guess, we've had to do a lot of repairs, uh, just to, to make sure that, that, uh that, um, that it, that the, that we do it right.
B:	What have you got growing right now?
M:	Well, it's, it, it is, uh, a perennial flower, uh...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then we're, we're also, we've got, uh, some blackberries and, uh and, some blueberries.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so I'm going to have to cut them up and put them in jars and let them come out.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I think it's done and I think I'll enjoy it.
B:	Okay,
M:	I'll just close the door behind me
B:	what kind,
M:	What kind of snow?
B:	what kind of onions do you grow? Do you grow those, those ten, fifteen Y?
M:	Uh, no, no.
B:	Oh, they, they are the best.
M:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	So we put them in a bag, and we put the tomatoes in there and the peppers and then the, uh, tomatoes and then we put in some, uh, tomatoes and onions and I'm not sure what I put in the other two.
B:	Uh, those,
M:	And I thought, well, I can just take them home and put them outside.
B:	I see.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, those onions, I think, we, we planted like twice as much this year because, you know, we got, onions and they lasted from, you know, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so, or six weeks, from now, until, until like October,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, we really missed them when they were gone, because the ones from the grocery store just can't, compare.
M:	Uh, I, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I don't know how to judge it. I think it's good.
B:	She made these onion rings that were so good,
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, and, and, uh, you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in,  that it's an ingredient,
M:	Yeah, I know, I don't, I'm amazed at how much stuff I, I've put in.
B:	and, and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.
M:	Oh.
B:	Right. Right. We froze a lot of peppers. We let some turn red.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas. And, and chops them up in recipes and things like that.
M:	Uh-hums.
B:	Oh, yeah. Put them in salad, yeah.
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	You're, you're making me hungry here.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
M:	and it's, it's real good.
B:	Yellow peppers, huh.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Sounds like you have a real good garden.
M:	Well, we do. We have a pretty small backyard.
B:	Just let me see what I got, I got the peas and I've got some broccoli, uh, onions some, some radishes and, uh, uh, beets.
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	Uh, and I planted potatoes too.
M:	Oh, how nice.
B:	Oh, the potato, They were, they're delicious but they, you don't get, seem to get that much for the space,
M:	Yeah.
B:	they, they do.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Some beet, uh, potatoes
M:	Yeah, I don't, I didn't like them, but I don'm
B:	and I've got some tomatoes still growing, in, in containers,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I got to wait for a place to, to, to free up.
M:	Oh, that's good.
B:	Uh, our, our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year.
M:	Yeah, we, we've had a lot of luck with them.
B:	We've got some good, um, um, Hybrid Burpee uh uh, pickler cucumbers
M:	Uh.
B:	and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own
M:	Uh, I don't know, I think that would be fun.
B:	I know it. I said, why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers, you know?
M:	Yeah.
B:	I guess. But we're going to try that, and see how that works.
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	An experiment.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I'd like to try, you know, just try something new, every year that, I haven't tried before
M:	Yeah, that's, that, that would be good.
B:	and,
M:	Yeah, I've heard that's really good.
B:	Well.
M:	Yeah.
