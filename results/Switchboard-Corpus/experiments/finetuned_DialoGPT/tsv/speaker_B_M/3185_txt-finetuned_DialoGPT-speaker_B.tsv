B:	Oh, you like the rain, do you?
M:	Um, well, not really. I just, I've been real lucky just, um, I, I'm originally from New York, and so I've lived here about two years and I've only lived here for two years so I really haven't been, you know, real experienced with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's been up to fifty-nine, so I guess it's not too bad.
B:	Oh, are you? I don't care for that as much.
M:	I, I like it, but it's just that when it's real cold I just want to go outside.
B:	No.
M:	It's kind of,
B:	I'm a summer person
M:	Summer person.
B:	I like the heat.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, and I'm from Utah, so, I, I like, the four seasons
M:	!!! Remind me.
B:	I just don't like the cold.
M:	!!!!!!It!!You!!I!!That!!Oh!!Well!!And I hope you get some rain up there.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I know people that have had it and they say it lasts about three weeks.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and then it stops.
B:	The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Well, we have several children that are in sports, and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.
M:	Oh, my.
B:	I like it better, I think.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	It's going to get even cooler. And, uh.
B:	The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity, that part I don't care about.
M:	Oh, I,
B:	Oh, really.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that.
B:	Oh, is that right?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Well another reason, well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. We have a little garden that we have and and so it really helps our garden,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way and they like rain, or, it seems they thrive when it rains, they just, really,
M:	Well, I, I like it here.

B:	and I'm okay. But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that
M:	Yeah
B:	I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.
M:	Yeah
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	So, I think we've really, I guess, taken a little bit of a turn in our attitudes toward that.
B:	That's okay Um, I've, I've thought about that, too, and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It just really gets way, when it gets way too hot
M:	Yeah, it's, it gets, uh, you know, we've been wanting to take our summer off and just spend the day with the kids, you can spend the whole week in the house,
B:	and we've been here for several years, and we've been here years when it's been hundreds and,
M:	Uh, so you've never been to a beach?
B:	Years, uh-huh.
