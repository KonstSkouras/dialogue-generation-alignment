B:	Well, uh, uh about the same I dress for school. I, uh, I am a graduate student so, I don't have to worry too much about, uh, what I wear too much of the time. Which is nice.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh Uh, uh, although I do, uh, a lot of,
M:	Well what type of things do you do?
B:	I am a speech pathology major and so I do a lot of clinical work and when I do clinic work then I have to, uh, uh, look my best.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Unfortunately.
M:	Unfortunately.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah, sure. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, uh, do you find that, uh, on the average do people give uh, more credibility or less credibility to a professional, uh, to professionally dressed individual.
M:	Well, I think it depends on the person.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I think that, that's, that, you know, the, the average American is now going to be embarrassed for what he did.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh uh, I was the only one that, that I was able to, to actually get into a job with, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I did that for about four years.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	That's what I did when I was growing up, was I wore, uh shorts and a t-shirt,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I went home and I went to the store and bought a pair of those and I said, well, I'm not going to have to wear those.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	and I went out and bought me a dress.
B:	Even the farmers.
M:	Yeah, well, that's true, but, uh.
B:	Oh, wow.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, certainly.
M:	Yeah, it's a, it is a, uh a very casual, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah, it depends. Sure. Uh, so you don't, uh, if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not?
M:	Well, I wouldn't wear a suit. I wouldn tuck it in the shirt pocket.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so, uh.
B:	Right, right.
M:	He should be.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, that, uh, if if you wanted to, uh, uh, really get into a hot issue, uh well at least in some in some beliefs, uh, how people dress when they go to church is, uh, is uh, sometimes a pretty, pretty hot topic.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh Uh, yeah. I'm, I am, uh, I go to the Church of Christ. I have been raised in the Church of Christ and, uh, but, uh, I, uh, too many times you hear you hear a lot about what what you're, uh, supposed you're supposed to look your Sunday best uh, uh, and dress and proper attire
M:	Uh,
B:	and, uh, and sometimes that really disappoints me, uh, in, uh, when I see in other economic areas like in Kentucky.
M:	Well, see, I live in Texas.
B:	You know, people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because  they don't have the clothes to wear.
M:	Right, well,  That's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I am also from WestVirginia where the Blacks are so busy.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uh, I, I think that, uh, that, that the, uh
B:	Certainly.
M:	You know, if you've got the room, the space to put things, then you can do what you want with it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	When you're in a, in a corporate environment, I think it's, it's important to be very casual.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, that's not always true.
B:	Uh, yeah a little bit. Uh, uh of course in the summer if I can get away with it, I wear, uh, uh, a pair of shorts and that's it. Run around barefoot, no shirt or anything But, uh,
