B:	Oh, boy.
M:	Yeah, so he's a little bit young for a kindergartner.
B:	Yeah.
M:	We have a seven year old and a three year old.
B:	Are you? Where are a student?
M:	Uh, University of Rochester.
B:	No kidding.
M:	Yeah, so that's a real change.
B:	I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and so that's going away.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, so, we, we have, uh
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Well, that's a good experience, I think, and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic, are pretty good and they kind of boil down to, uh, any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about, people who were going to be loving
M:	Uh.
B:	and, uh, that's more important than anything else. We could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh, she goes to a home. This is a, uh, a couple, uh, emigrated from China early in, in their lives.
M:	Huh.
B:	They've been here probably thirty, forty years.
M:	Thirty years?
B:	They've got three daughters. Uh, and, they have a loving home and, uh, they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.
M:	Oh.
B:	And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends,
M:	Uh.
B:	so it's a good experience.
M:	Yeah, I've never had to leave my kids at home without them,
B:	I if it's good, I think it's very good for the child.
M:	Yeah, I, I agree with you there.
B:	And if it's, a loving environment, I think it's very good and, and that's really what we've learned about it. She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year
M:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, we feel real fortunate and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace. I don't know what it's like around, uh, Hattiesburg.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. I'll bet they're involved. Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah
M:	So, uh.
B:	Well, that's, uh, I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important, decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry
M:	Uh.
B:	and I think this is really  is buyer beware.  Well, it is the best way  to do it, interestingly.
M:	That's right.
B:	I think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market. As a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care.
M:	Right. Right. Right, right.
B:	Primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life.
M:	Right. Right.
B:	It's, it's phenomenal. It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
