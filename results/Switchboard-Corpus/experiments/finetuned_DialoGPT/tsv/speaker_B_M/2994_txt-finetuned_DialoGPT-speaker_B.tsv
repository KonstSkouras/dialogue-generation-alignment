B:	Yeah. And a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them.
M:	Right.
B:	You're supposed to what.
M:	Well, I mean, they, they've been doing that for years, but they've also been doing it for a couple of years now.
B:	But what are you supposed to do with them. Oh, okay.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But they're, uh, I think they're out of season yet.
B:	We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit and then we take them, take them in.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hum.
B:	Yeah, we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,
M:	Uh,
B:	so, we generally don't have those to do.
M:	Right.
B:	You know, they, they charge you, you know, it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.
M:	Uh, I know.
B:	And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now. And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,
M:	Yeah.
B:	they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill.
M:	Right, right.
B:	That that might be a better way to do it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash.
M:	Right.
B:	You know, because then it would, then it would make monetary sense to them, you know, to say, hey, you know, if I just spend the time to, to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then I don't have to pay for them hauling it off.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and you put it in your car, and they, they pick it up at the curb.
B:	Oh, yeah that's about the same kind of thing.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!ets!! That's how we do it.
B:	Where do you live?
M:	In Plano.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	So, yeah.
B:	Yes.
M:	Okay.
B:	It seems like they would be able to.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But I think it would be a good idea to have, you know, maybe some kind of a fund set up for people to use for things like that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And they're not going to, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, it's, uh, I don't, I haven't, you know, I hadn't, uh
B:	Yeah, that's true .
M:	So, I don know.
B:	Um, now I didn't know that, cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Okay.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me.
B:	Okay.
M:	Bye-bye.
B:	All right, bye-bye. voice said what's that voice said, where were they
