B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and that's, and, and the people that do carpool, um.
B:	I think so too. I'm in Texas
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	and very few people carpool
M:	Yeah.
B:	uh, the people that I know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job
M:	Uh, well, I guess that's true.
B:	they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know, they just feel they need their car.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and it's, you're stuck with it
B:	That's right. And people don't want to give it up but now I think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and to change the car itself
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	but, uh, you know, I, I don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent
M:	Yeah.
B:	but
M:	I don't know, it, it's just, it seems to me that, uh
B:	Well, my other line is ringing
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	but we're going to ignore it
M:	Okay, fine.
B:	I'm sorry for these beeps,
M:	Okay, um,
B:	Oh, close to five minutes, I believe.
M:	Okay, okay.
B:	And you're in Minneapolis,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, is the pollution really bad up there?
M:	No, it's not bad at all.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah
M:	and you, you know, you get a little sick of them.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and so it's, it's very, very, uh, uh, very difficult to, uh you know, to, to know, uh if it, it, uh
B:	Well that's the way it has gotten here.
M:	Uh, it's, it, it was a lot of fun, but, uh.
B:	We have just had that law, I think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in Texas
M:	Uh-uh. Oh, that's good.
B:	but, uh, I think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that
M:	Yeah.
B:	and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed
M:	Yeah.
B:	and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the C F C that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	uh, they can't use, like, I have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems
M:	Right.
B:	therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever it is, it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
M:	Right.
B:	and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many C F C into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much so eventually people are going to have to go to newer systems, you know,
M:	Uh, I think that's, I agree with you. I think it's, uh I think they're, they're definitely ahead of schedule on that.
B:	But,
M:	I, I, I think, I agree with you there. I think that, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	and, and, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know, I guess, I don't have much of a choice as far as, uh uh, car repairs go.
B:	Um.
M:	and he put it out there and he says, you know, you can't use it yet, and it's going to leak, and he opened the can and he said, well, you don't have to do that yet, so, you'll have to wait until they do that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	it was, I, I thought he, he, I think he misread something, and I'm not sure if he's right or not.
B:	It's probably happened to millions of people,
M:	Yeah, I think so, too.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	so you have to pay forty dollars.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	And I think that, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and then, you know, the, the people that, that, uh, you can buy a lot of these little canned drinks, and you can take them to a doctor's office or whatever,
B:	Inhaled so much of it, uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, but it's not like it was, it's just a big, thick foggy kind of thing.
B:	Yeah, well, of course in the, uh, I think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt,
M:	Uh-hud.
