M:	and she's a hundred and two.
B:	Right.
M:	And, um.
B:	Oh, it's very difficult I know.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	She, uh she has been a good dog to have.
B:	Right.
M:	But she has, she can talk to anybody and, uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I guess, I, I don't know.
B:	Yeah, how old is she?
M:	She's eighty-seven.
B:	Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.
M:	Yeah, I, I'm sure, I mean, I know what you mean. I, uh.
B:	I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so,
M:	Uh-hugs, I know,
B:	They're in Missouri and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So,
M:	Well, I guess that's about all I can say.
B:	Right.
M:	And I think that's a really neat idea. I think there's some real potential for nursing homes and I think they've done a really good job of that.
B:	Yeah, there's one very close to where my parents are but, uh, I think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.
M:	Yeah.
B:	So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh,
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and, but I think you'd have to really, they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.
M:	Yeah, I've, I, I know. I, uh I, the other thing that bothers me is, uh.
B:	But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,
M:	I know.
B:	I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.
M:	Yeah.
B:	They never go to see them.
M:	That's right, they don't care about anybody except themselves.
B:	I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, maybe, maybe Christmas.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	um, I don't know, I just, I have, I've never really looked into it. I've heard horror stories.
B:	Right.
M:	Uh, and I'm not sure that, uh, I think the quality of nursing homes is, uh-havings compared to other types of care.
B:	Oh, I do too.
M:	And, uh,
B:	Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So.
M:	Well, I'm not real sure I, I think that the nursing home is a real good option.
B:	Anyway.
M:	Well, I think, I, I'm, I don't know, I guess I'm kind of mixed on the subject of drug testing. I, you know, there's a lot of things I think I think are, are very wrong.
B:	Right. Oh, it's tough I'm sure.
M:	Yeah, it really is.
B:	Oh. Right, that would be devastating I'm sure so.
M:	Yeah.
B:	It is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh, I don't know. I, I just don't think it's a very good idea.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And she said that she would not be able to take care of him. And I, I, you know, I don't think that that's right. I think that's a very, very healthy, uh  standard of living.
B:	Right.
M:	But, uh.
B:	I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.
M:	Well, we're, we've got a few places that are available if you want to go to the Dallas location.
B:	Well, anyway,
M:	Well that's all right.
B:	We've covered a little bit and, uh, it's good to hear from you and,
M:	It was nice talking to you.
B:	Have a good,
M:	You too.
B:	Have a good
