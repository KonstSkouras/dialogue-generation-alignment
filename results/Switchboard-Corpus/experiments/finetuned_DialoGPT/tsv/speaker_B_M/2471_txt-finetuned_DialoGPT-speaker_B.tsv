B:	Uh-huh. Well that's,
M:	But, I don't know. I think, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I don't know, I, there's a lot of things that could be done about it. I mean, I don tinker around with it too much.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. I, I agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world, and so, uh, there's a lot of money to be made there, and it's, uh, be very difficult to, to cut it back to a, a level where it should be.
M:	Uh, I, uh I think, uh uh, we, we have to do something. We have to, uh.
B:	And, and, uh, it will come back to haunt us, it seems to come in cycles.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	and then we have a, a, uh a real resentment of the United States toward Mexico, and I think that's, uh.
B:	Right, and the, probably the biggest problem down there is that's where the, that's the drug entry points,
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
B:	and their economy is, of several of the countries, especially Columbia, is so built on the, on on the drugs, that, uh, our, our little war on drugs has really been laughable. It's just a, you know, such a small amount, and it it just, it, uh, cuts off just a trickle, and, uh, if, if we can't get a handle on that through some, through some, uh, method, I don't know where, that will be another big problem.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Right, right.
M:	so, it's, it is, it really is, and I, I, you, you can see it in some of the, in some, in the, uh in some areas of the country where they have to pay for their own land, but, you don't see it, you're right, it doesn't, it isn't really a government thing.
B:	And as long as we're the largest, uh, consumer, then, uh, this is the market.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, oh, yeah, I, I used to think that was the market, but, uh.
B:	If we can cut back the usage, then uh, maybe it will have to go someplace else.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	You know, it's, it, it really is a, a change.
B:	we're just so much wealthier, and, uh, and, uh, there has to be resentment built up,
M:	Right.
B:	and that's where, uh, leaders can use, uh, use that whenever the opportune moment arises.
M:	Uh, uh-hue, uh.
B:	Yeah. That's right. Our own hemisphere, but we've, that's been, uh, that's been the way it's always been.
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	So, uh,
M:	Well, I think that, uh
B:	Very much so, except when we need them. You know when they found oil in Mexico, then we got very friendly with them again.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Um.
M:	And, uh, I guess, uh  we're probably going to see a lot more of that.
B:	Okay.
M:	Okay, well, I think that, um, I, I don't know, I just, I feel that, that, you know, that the, the police should, uh, be more involved in their handling of the problem.
B:	Sure did.
M:	And I, I just felt that it was, it was important to me to have some background knowledge on what was going on.
B:	Always, yes ma'am.
M:	And, uh, I, I don't know, I think that, that, uh you know, we need to just, uh uh, go ahead and let these people go and let them go.
B:	You too, dear.
M:	Thank you.
B:	Bye.
