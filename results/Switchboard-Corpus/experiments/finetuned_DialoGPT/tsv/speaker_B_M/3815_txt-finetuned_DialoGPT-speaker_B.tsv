B:	Uh, usually either black or red.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And electric windows, and power locks
M:	Yeah.
B:	Now,
M:	that's, that's the way we were living, I guess.
B:	Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It is just a real pain, or, you know, if I'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the window.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, uh, just really help a lot
M:	Right.
B:	What about you?
M:	Well, I'm, I work at T I.
B:	Oh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Sure.
M:	and I just, I don, I can not even, I mean, I, I think that, that I just can not put myself through college without a, uh a master's degree in something that I'm not good at.
B:	Have you ever had a car with an air bag?
M:	Uh, no.
B:	No.
M:	I, I'm, I've, I went to the auto show this weekend and they had a big thing about air bags and how they're supposed to work.
B:	Well, it, it sure seems to save lives and
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	uh, yeah. I, actually, I like the anti-lock brakes.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have never had a chance to, I have been in cars that have had them, but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, uh, you know, on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up.
M:	Yeah, I, I think that's, that, that would be a good thing to do.
B:	But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or Japanese?
M:	Well, I think I would like to, but unfortunately I'm not familiar with those either.
B:	What was that?
M:	Ause.
B:	Huh, stick shift, huh?
M:	Yeah, that, that was the Chrysler.
B:	Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed?
M:	Um, three eighty-six.
B:	Wow.
M:	And, uh, I thought, well, that's a pretty good deal. And, uh.
B:	Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift and, what, I'm, I'm curious. I, I know why I love a stick shift. Why why did you want one?
M:	Well I just like, I just really like it. I think it's, it's so smooth and, and, uh, and it's the only thing that I hate is if you drive it wrong you can't get out of control.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I just, I really just like, I, uh, I like to have the automatic transmission on my car.
B:	It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.
M:	Well they, they're, they've come in handy.
B:	Huh, yeah.
M:	But, uh,
B:	No, I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.
M:	Yeah, yeah, well, I, I like the, the, I don't know, I guess the, uh, I'm not too much of a sports car person, I think I'm more of a, uh a luxury car person.
B:	Huh.
M:	But, uh, I don't know, I think there's still a, a lot of options. There's a lot, but I don, I really don't see a, I guess there's a good use for a fifth wheel than a standard.
B:	Huh.
M:	And so I was thinking well, you know, maybe, you need to go to a dealer and ask him about it.
B:	Uh, I guess I, I grew up on it and it's fun. It's, it's an enjoyable part of driving. I do feel like I have, uh, more control over the car
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in snow and ice and slick conditions.
M:	Uh. Uh-hum.
B:	Uh, it, it does, uh, I don't know, it, it's really more fun than anything else. As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, yeah
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah, uh, of course, I like gadgets and, and, uh, fun things, on the cars, which are all the things, course, the
