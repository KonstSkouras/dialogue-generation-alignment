B:	Yeah. Yeah, I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh, in the computer field. And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits. Uh, I've worked for, for for awhile and they are, you know, a really academic type of place. And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry type places. And then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff. So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially paid and, you know, some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits and so, yeah, I would
M:	Right.
B:	I'd say health care is way up there, especially anybody with kids. Uh and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know. When we, when I think about changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of health care they have
M:	Uh, I think that's probably the most important thing.
B:	and does the company pay for it. You know, all or partially or how does that work.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big one for me.  Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other, you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh, cause I've  been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any and  some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	so that's not so bad, you know.
M:	That's true. That's true, I guess I'm just used to it now, you, you're used to when you go to a restaurant, you don't really think about what's out there
B:	You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though. want to just, you know, all your salary can't even begin  to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know in a major illness or something. Uh.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So.
B:	Yeah. Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.
M:	Well, yeah, I think so. I, I, uh, I've always been a flexible person and I think that's probably why I was so good at school was because I worked more than I did because I did have to work.
B:	Uh, cause that makes a big difference. My wife works part-time.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.
M:	Oh, uh-hauhuh, uh.
B:	And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week, I, uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus So she you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon til close. Uh, so we have
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, and being on a, you know, rigid schedule wouldn't, there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.
M:	No, I think, uh.
B:	And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too.
M:	That's true.
B:	I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting, up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time, you know. And even in summer time, sometimes you get home so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And especially in the winter. I mean, you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know. It's like, it's like a vampire sometimes
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	He's a great man and I think that, you, you have to have the leadership to do something like that.
B:	Uh, a lot of I guess is.
M:	What's that?
B:	Yeah. I think some of, is how the, uh, you know, I guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at work.
M:	Right.
B:	Cause I've been, uh, especially in large corporations. You can really, you know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems I've found out. I've worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, you know, type companies. And it, and especially if you're doing like professional work. Where you know, it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing you know.
M:	Right.
B:	If you're, like I've, I work with, uh, computer systems a lot. So it's kind of hard to say, you know. If you're, you know, a brick layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know, fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down, you know Yeah, you did a great job. But if you build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program really do, you know. Or, especially if you write like papers, you know.  Or do design studies or something.
M:	Right. Right. Yeah, that's true.
B:	It's real hard to rate something like that.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist. It's like well you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or whatever
M:	Yeah.
