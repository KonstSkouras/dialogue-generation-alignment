B:	Uh ...
M:	I don't know, I think that's, that's a little extreme. I don't think that, uh you know. I think you should, you should test for drugs just to make sure you're drug tested.
B:	Oh, uh, I was tested, uh, within my company. I think it's kind of a push to, uh, weed out drugs in states and, because I don't know of any other countries that are doing this
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I, I feel like it's really just within the United States. It's, uh, it's okay. I think your record should stand for itself. That, you know, if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever, then I don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over.
M:	Uh, I, uh.
B:	And once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not. I think they could, uh, save money by not doing that. You know, every time, say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	Uh, not if it's done fairly. And that's probably my question is, how, how do you know it's done fairly.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but if it is done fairly well, then maybe that's a problem.
B:	Well, they might tell you it's random.
M:	Yeah, well, that's true.
B:	But then, you know, it's kind of like a, a lottery. Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything, and tries and tries and tries. You know.
M:	Yeah. I think that's true.
B:	Oh, I see. How'd, how did they, how do they pick their people?
M:	Uh, they, uh, they go through the list of, of potential applicants, and, and sort of weed them out.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then they have to pick from a list of, of, uh, college athletes that they want to be drug tested.
B:	Oh, I see. So, do you ...
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right. Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place. You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested.
M:	I don't think they have the authority to say that.
B:	Right.
M:	but, uh,
B:	Right.
M:	and I think it's a big problem.
B:	Right, right. Yeah, it, it would almost be like a, a, uh ...
M:	I, I don't know, I, I think I, it's interesting that, that, you know, we have such a high level of self-discipline and I think it's becoming a major problem.
B:	Uh-huh. And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and, you know, your supervisor has accused you of using drugs.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me of that now.
B:	Right. I agree with that. Because I know personally myself, I've been in the same job for three years, it will be three years in August and I've already been drug tested three times.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	Well, I'm an environmental engineer
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	and I've been drug tested three times and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company I work for is sixty thousand people, plus. So see I, for some reason, I've come up three times. That's pretty high statistics.
M:	Uh, do you know what I mean?
B:	No. No, not at all.
M:	You know, I, I don't know, that's, that would be a tough question. I don tinker with it, but, uh, I think that's what they, they do it for.
B:	It's a legal job, you know
M:	Yeah, it's a job that's, that's for certain, and, uh, I, I don't know, I just don't think that, that there should be a, a broad based, uh policy.
B:	so, see it's really strange.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	and they asked me if I had a certain doctor, and I said yes, and that was it.
B:	Right. Well, does your, the company say, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative.
M:	Uh, I think they're required to say something, I don t remember what it is, but they do have the, uh a list of things that they want you to do.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, I've, I have, I'm a certified teacher and I, you know, I know what a drug test is and I don tinker around with it or anything.
B:	Right, right.
M:	And I was a little upset about that.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that's one of the reasons why they were, they were having a hard time with that and I think it's important that, that, you know, they had to do something about it.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. And are they tested random?
M:	Yeah, they, they are.
B:	They're ...
M:	and they're all tested positive for drugs.
B:	Oh, okay. I see.
M:	So, uh, yeah, I mean, I, I would, I think I would probably be more concerned with, with safety than with, than with the, you know, the quality of products.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You know, I, I think I could work in a hospital.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that's probably why.
B:	Oh, I see.
M:	And they, they, uh, they're very, uh...
B:	Uh-huh. Okay, so they know that. And that's ...
M:	Yeah, they, they really do.
B:	Uh-huh. Okay. Well ...
M:	And I don't know if you heard about this, but I'm sure you have heard of it.
B:	Yeah
M:	I don't know.
B:	I think so. Yeah, seven twenty-five.
M:	Okay, well, I enjoyed talking to you.
B:	Okay, nice speaking to you.
M:	Nice talking to you too.
B:	Bye.
