B:	How many square feet do you have?
M:	!!!!,!!%!!Unit!! unit!!action!! commands!!All!!!.!!;!!!'!!Okay!!That's, that's a pretty small house.
B:	Four bedrooms?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Five bedrooms. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	I made a, I made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a, uh, what we call a sunroom to get the, you know,
M:	Uh-hum.
B:	when, when we added four hundred square feet to our house
M:	Uh-hums.
B:	so that,
M:	That's great, that is great. Yeah, we're, we've been thinking about getting one for our son's, too, but, um, we haven't really decided on which one to go with, because, uh
B:	How many stories? Just one?
M:	Yeah, just one.
B:	How are they built?
M:	Uh, Fox and, uh, Jacobs, uh.
B:	Yeah. I've heard that, I've heard the construction is pretty good on Fox and Jacobs.
M:	!!!%!! translated They're built like a log house.
B:	But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?
M:	No, it doesn t give you any trouble at all.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But it, it, uh, it doesn taint your already beautiful house.
B:	No cracked slab or anything like that?
M:	Um, not that I know of. We, we've had, you know, like, a couple of burglaries in our neighborhood.
B:	All right.
M:	So,
B:	And is it, um, a natural gas and,
M:	No, it's natural gas.
B:	You know what I miss though? Basements.
M:	Yeah, I know what you mean.
B:	I I sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas.
M:	Yeah, well, I, I don't know, I guess that's, that's a, that, that is a problem with the, with the whole country, you know,
B:	So you,
M:	so we have to have,
B:	Can you stand up in it?
M:	Yeah.
B:	So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here.
M:	Yeah.
B:	ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much room in the attic.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	So, five bedrooms and two living, two family
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we have a den and a den, and, uh you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time.
M:	I don't know, sometimes it's funny, because we're the ones who always end up spending all day at the house.
B:	You
M:	Uh-uh. Well, that's, that is a, that, that does happen. I think that, uh, there's, uh, you know there's an understanding of, of the, uh...
B:	Right. Some people, I mean, families seem to migrate towards one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh, uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Strange.
M:	It's really strange.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, it's just, it, it looks like it's going to take forever.
B:	Right, right. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	So you've been fairly happy with it. How long have you been in it?
M:	Uh, about four years.
B:	Wow. Boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh, came to this area about the same time
M:	Uh-hope.
B:	We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that we're living in.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that it's pier and beam.
M:	Uh, beam mirrors.
B:	Yours is a slab I assume.
M:	Yeah, right.
B:	Yeah, ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have done if it was slab.
M:	Uh-hau.
B:	I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that, by myself and saved a lot of money that I couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.
M:	Well, you're, you are very, very wise.
B:	But that's because it's so old.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	It's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build like that, and, uh,
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	I know, he's not a handy, right?
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me.
B:	I, on the other hand, uh, do a lot too much of it
M:	Uh, yeah, I do, too.
B:	and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right. My Dad is actually, uh,
