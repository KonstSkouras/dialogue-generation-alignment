B:	That's the only way I could really,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And then they also have like, uh a little float where you can bring stuff in and, you, you go and you get it out and they just, they, they have like a little display where you have to, you have your money in your wallet, and then they, you just pay five dollars for it.
B:	During the summers, like the, around where I live the, uh, homeless people I mean, they all have like shopping carts and stuff
M:	Uh.
B:	and they're go around and collect cans and aluminum and stuff,
M:	Uh.
B:	and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them.
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	But, when, during the winter time I think they, they move south or something
M:	Uh.
B:	so, I don't do that anymore. And the, the recycling at Georgia Tech, like that, uh, outside the, uh, student center they never empty those things.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	They just overflow.
M:	Yeah.
B:	So what's a guy to do?
M:	I don't know.
B:	I asked myself.
M:	Why is there always a foggy feeling in the mountains?
B:	Really? Huh, oh, yeah, that's true, hadn't thought about that. That is very inconvenient.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Inconvenient, even
M:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, so, you do recycle, don't you?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I'm kind of, I'm kind of bad about it.
M:	Well, I don't know if you have to be.
B:	If I, if see a, if I see a pile of cans or bottles or something I'll throw it in there
M:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't really, I don't ever take anything.
M:	Uh, I have, uh, a, a real problem with it. I, I work in a food store and, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, the people who buy the, uh, the aluminum pop cans are going to have to pay for that because they're not contributing to the good of the country.
B:	But wait
M:	I know.
B:	I've never seen you before Who are you?
M:	Uh, well, I'm not too sure. I've seen her around, but, uh, I've never been to Dallas.
B:	Yeah, my name's Bill. Well,
M:	I'm Bill from Raleigh, North Carolina.
B:	Hi.
M:	How are you today?
B:	Me, too.
M:	How do you like your job?
B:	Crazy. Uh, well, is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy, Julie?
M:	Well, I'm, I, I really don't know. I'm not really into recycling. I think it's a waste.
B:	Do they do like, what about, like, uh, what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle, do you know?
M:	Uh, not, not really. We're not too big on it. Uh.
B:	Really?
M:	Yeah.
B:	What about like those grocery bags?
M:	Well, they're, they've been around for a long time, but they're not, you know, they don't fit right now, and, and I don't know what they do.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	They'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic.
M:	Yeah, they'll ask.
B:	uh.
M:	And, you know, and then you can throw them in there and, you can, you, you throw them away and, and I don't know, I'm, I donno, I, I really don't like it.
B:	Those petroleum products are going to kill us.
M:	I know.
B:	The hostile planet, I think, Julie.
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	The petroleum pretty much, I mean, those petroleum products I think are the big, uh, you know the great Satan of the recycling.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um. Paper just seems so innocuous.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that. That's a great one.
B:	Paper doesn't seem threatening at all, you know.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, that book.
B:	It comes from trees. How can it be bad?
M:	Well they, they put up a fence, but they put a fence around it, but it's not going to do you much good.
B:	They treat it with chemicals or something? Why can't trees break down? I don't get it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yep. Oh
M:	And they have to, they have the, uh, you have to have certain trees to have mulch.
B:	Really?
M:	Yeah, it's real easy.
B:	Huh.
M:	So, I, I guess I've never had to do that.
B:	I'm going to switch  from those yellow legal pads, then.
M:	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going,  to switch to those.
B:	I'm glad you told me that, because I use those at work, where I work and, uh, But I can just forget that from now on. I'm going I'm going to switch to the white ones.
M:	Oh, yeah, I, I'm not a lawyer, I just, I've been lawyer for, oh, just over a year.
B:	Well, what about, uh, papyrus, you know, made out of you know, bamboo stuff, from the from the  banks of the Nile.
M:	!!!%!! translated.
B:	You think so?
M:	I think so.
B:	Tablets?
M:	I think so. I think so, too.
B:	I think we should just abandon the, you know, the written word altogether, you know.
M:	!!!%!!;!! LINE!!body!!LINE!!All!!list!!all!!sv!!two!! exists!! That's the way it should be.
B:	What do you think?
M:	I, I, I really think that, uh, we've gotten into a period of time where, uh.
B:	Kind of radical, I know but,
M:	I don't think it's going to last.
B:	That's true. Everyone had a two way wrist watch T V on their wrist, like, uh, Dick Tracy.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
