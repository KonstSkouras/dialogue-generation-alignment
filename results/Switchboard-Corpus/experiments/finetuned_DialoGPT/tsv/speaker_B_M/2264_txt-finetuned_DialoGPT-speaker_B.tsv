B:	Huh-uh.
M:	And, you're not supposed to put your stuff in the garbage, and they pick it up at the curb, but you're supposed to.
B:	they'll help you, recycle, because we, there is some bins, like behind Wal-Mart, that take some things.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	Because I finally asked because, you know, we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and I ask in Wal-Mart and they said they moved it just behind.
M:	Yeah, they moved the ones that were behind the counter to the other ones, too.
B:	Huh-uh.
M:	But, uh, you just don't have the time to do it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So we went and took it to the, uh, the city, and they took it up to the city. And, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Um, and I can't even remember what they call those things.
B:	Like aluminum cans?
M:	Yeah, I, I like to use those.
B:	That's about what we do too.
M:	Yeah, I, I've done that, too. I've made like, uh, two or three different ones. I just use plastic.
B:	Well, I guess, um, down in, kind of in North Dallas, there is a place that will take almost anything.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I don't, we just don't have the room to store all that much, you know,
M:	Yeah.
B:	I don't want to be running down there every week, or whatever.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, and, uh, I'm sure that the more we learn to do with it, the more it seems to work out.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and then I just throw them away, you can't take them.
B:	Those milk cartons take up so much room.
M:	Right.
B:	I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	We were using baby food and there was so many baby food jars, kind of what started it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Some of our neighbors were doing it and so, you know, when I found out some places to take it, and, um, like, um, they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there, and I know that they're going to use, you know, the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing. Put lights and stuff
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	so, you know, if I'm not going to get the money for aluminum, I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound. to do something with, you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. That's true. And they won't raise our taxes.
M:	!!!%!!etwork!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah .
M:	But,
B:	No, I don't. I have a friend, of mine told me about this program, is the reason that I'm,
M:	Oh, that's a neat idea.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and then they would put you in a different one. And then they'd have a, a special room where you could drop them off and then you could go back and forth. And it was, it was really neat.
B:	is talking to someone in Sorry.
M:	Yeah, it's okay, it was nice talking to you.
B:	She'll be two in July.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Oh.
M:	and she was two and a half in March.
B:	Well, it was nice to talk to you. I know they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives. They pick up newspapers, I think.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's good.
B:	Okay.
M:	Bye.
