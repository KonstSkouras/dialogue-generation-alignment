B:	So they found a, a place nearby that they put her in last year.
M:	Huh.
B:	Uh, yeah, although she is, uh, in pretty good health and she's, doesn't take any medication, it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Then she was starting to get, uh, you know, lose memory sometimes and, which is kind of frightening when she's in the car.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Uh,
M:	And she, she, uh she's just a really good dog, but, uh.
B:	Well, yeah, when it finally came down to it, um, she just got to the point after the, I mean, it wasn't a very, um, strong stroke. It was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore.
M:	Oh.
B:	And she got kind of fearful of being on her own. She never really ate very well. It was one thing. She hardly  ever took care of herself
M:	Yeah.
B:	and she didn't eat. She ate very poor so I think she was, you know, bad, uh, nutrition on top of it. And, uh, she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore. So,
M:	Yeah, that's, that was, that, that would be a big conflict of interest.
B:	Um.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Well, she was almost ridiculous. Like she'd eat ice cream and cookies. She'd,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that
B:	Didn't one,
M:	And, and, and the, and she was, she really, you know, her, her mind was on the food,
B:	Oh really?
M:	Yeah, it really is, and I, I'm sure you'd, you'd notice that, you know, in the mornings, you get a, a light headed, you look down at your arm, and you walk up to your arm and knees out, and knees up high and you're just totally relaxed,
B:	Well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Oh, that's too much trouble. That's too much trouble. Didn't want to cook.
M:	!!!% That's what she said.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and I make, I make five hundred, uh, five hundred meals a week.
B:	Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels,  Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat.
M:	Uh-huh. Yeah. They have,  They have a cafeteria
B:	No, I don't think there was. Um, I know a little bit more from a, a co-worker. Her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in.
M:	Uh-hum.
B:	Um, she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care. Uh, then she got, uh, uh, hip broken and then, uh, she wasn't as ambulatory so they  were almost, you know, to the point of saying she can't be here anymore.
M:	Right.
B:	But, I remember from her checking around, she ended up staying at the Arkansas House I think out in Arlington, something like that.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh, a, uh, bathroom. All of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items
M:	Uh, that's true.
B:	They're always saying that somebody's going to, and some of them, I think unconsciously do it, you know,  as a just, you know, half
M:	Uh. Uh-hum.
B:	Uh So, they, they, uh, don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items. Very limited space waste
M:	Yeah.
B:	but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room  and, and eat some good meals.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I don't understand  that, they, they don't want to be with anybody else.
M:	That's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I don t understand that. I don, I think it's a problem that, that the elderly can't, can't handle.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it's, it, it seems to me that, uh...
B:	Yeah, I have a, um, my aunt's mother is, uh, gotten ill recently and, uh, she lives in Pennsylvania, they live in Alabama. And they're saying, hey, we need you to be closer and you have, women like that,
M:	Uh.
B:	I don't to men, it seems like the women out just out live their husbands, but, very reluctantly, that  whole, I mean
M:	Yeah
B:	they don't get out of the house, they don't socialize but it's my home and I don't want to leave it.
M:	Uh, that's, that, that is a tough situation.
B:	Uh.
M:	And, and, uh, I donno, I think that's going to be a long-term thing for, for the nursing homes, you know, the, the nursing home and the, and the future of nursing homes.
B:	Um.
M:	And, uh, you know, it's like, I don tinker around with my own equipment and I'm not going to do that
B:	But it's, it's so lonely, you know they can't get out and see anyone and I mean, it's hard for, for someone like me to understand that
M:	Right.
B:	because I I think, what do you have there? It's a house,
M:	Well, I have a, I've got a, a, uh, two year old,
B:	it's walls and it's furniture but  there's nobody there.
M:	Oh, that's a shame.
B:	Don't you want to be close to me? I mean, you know  be with other people.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I just don't understand why they, so much want to just stay in  that building.
M:	Right.
B:	And there's no family there, they don't get to see their grandkids, they don't get to see their children, they just there in that house.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's, it's a big problem.
B:	That's from the child's standpoint. The child is going, why don't you want to be close to me and your other family.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	What does that house got attraction?
M:	Well, the house that we bought was, uh, an older house and the people that we got were, uh...
B:	I know they're really proud of independence.
M:	And, uh, I think they're very, very protective.
B:	Uh.
M:	And, uh, they're, they've had some, uh...
B:	Well, when she got home, who took care of her?
M:	Well it was my mother.
B:	Oh.
M:	And, uh, I, I'm not sure how, how it works now. I know that they have, uh  parental control on all these things.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, we've, we, we're not, we live in a real small little house.
B:	Um
M:	So, it, it really is frightening.
B:	Yeah, my, husband and I, we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	So we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here.
M:	Yeah.
