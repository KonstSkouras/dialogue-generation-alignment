B:	Uh, and it's, uh, I guess what they call a story and a half. Because it's not a full two story. Where, you know, everything on top is on bottom.
M:	Yeah.
B:	So, it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And, uh, it's about a five year old house now.
M:	Oh, that's, that sounds great.
B:	It's, uh, pretty nice. Unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah. It was a, Landmark is the one who built it.
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah. That's true.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Exactly what happened to them.
M:	Right.
B:	Oh, that's nice.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	and, uh, it's just, it just really makes it look nice. It's, uh
B:	Are you doing it yourself?
M:	I'm doing it myself.
B:	Wow.
M:	It's a, it's a little rough, you know,
B:	Oh, that's nice.
M:	Yeah, I'm, I work in the legal department at Texas Instruments, so I do a lot of that
B:	Oh, I see. Huh.
M:	So, uh, I was pretty fortunate. I didn't have to work,
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I've, I'm, I work with someone else right now that I go to school with.
B:	That's great.
M:	It was just too much. And I felt like I could do without the credit.
B:	is that so? I didn't know that.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well that sounds kind of dumb.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and you're going to have to pay more for it because you're not going to be able to use it for more than what you paid for it
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	So, I don't know.
B:	Huh.
M:	I, I guess we've kind of exhausted that one, I'm not sure.
B:	That's right
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	And, uh, that, that would, that wouldn't help them at all.
B:	Uh-huh. That's good.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. How big a lot do you got it on?
M:	Um, it's about, um, it, it was about an eighth of an acre.
B:	Wow. That's nice. That's real nice.
M:	Uh-uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	So it's real hard to get him out and find him.
B:	God. That's pretty good.
M:	So,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	he's got a lot of plants in his yard, but, uh, he doesn't have any.
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	So, it's, it, it really is pretty.
B:	Oh, that's pretty good.
M:	So,
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?
M:	No.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you know, we have to do a lot more repairs on it than you would on it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	We, uh we've got two. We've got a three year old and a two year old.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Wow.
M:	And, uh, the air conditioning is on, you have to turn on the air conditioner,
B:	Yeah. That's pretty good.
M:	So,
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, uh.
B:	Wow.
M:	So.
B:	My wife would love that
M:	I would, too.
B:	She loves lots of windows. That's great.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Is it a single story?
M:	Yeah, it's single story.
B:	Oh, I see.
M:	Uh, it has a pool and, uh it has nice privacy fences around it.
B:	Uh-huh. Um, I see.
M:	And it's, it, it has a built in grill and it's got a water pump and air conditioner.
B:	Oh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, that's kind of like, like a Victorian style?
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah. I, I've always liked that. The, you know, I, we don't have much yard but I built a small deck in the back.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But, you know, I, I see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck.
M:	Right.
B:	I, I kind of wish I had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so I can build a real nice deck.
