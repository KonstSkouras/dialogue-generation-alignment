B:	Oh, that's wonderful. Okay.
M:	Uh, so I have two kids, so we're, uh, we're eating out probably about an average of four or five a week, and, uh we're spending about four hours a week with them.
B:	That's, what kind of fondue, the cheese dip or,
M:	Oh yeah, yeah.
B:	Right. Yeah.
M:	And then I'll make like a little Swiss cheese and put it on top of it. And then I just cover it with foil and put the foil on, and then I cover it up with foil, and let it steam.
B:	Oh, that sounds good.
M:	So, I, I had to stop by the store to buy that and I thought, I'm going to end up making that
B:	That's always a good thing. Vegetable trays always go over so well, because I think people get tired of eating junk. I mean, I think they like to have healthy stuff too, you know it's,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, definitely. I think better even than, than other kinds of food
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Right, exactly. Yeah.
M:	I, I like to eat, um, I don't know, I'm a real foodie, and I like good food.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's a lot of work.
B:	Oh. Yes. Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right, that's true. Or even have you ever seen where they, they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out, and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat .
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh
B:	Yep.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
B:	Oh, I think it would, it would be a lot of work but, um, you know, because it's, you know,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	you have to cut each thing or, you know, use the melon baller and stuff but, but I think they're really neat and, you know, I think they're worth the time, you know, because they,
M:	I think they are, too.
B:	Oh, yeah
M:	Yeah
B:	Right. Yeah.
M:	So, I mean, it's, it is, it really is a treat.
B:	Is that, is that good? You know, I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but I've never tried it, are they really good?
M:	Oh, they're wonderful.
B:	Oh, I bet it doesn't mix well, does it?
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!! commands!! command!!!!! execute!! execution!! display!! global!!sv!!ety!! collision!!body!! element!! This!!
B:	Oh, well, that's good because I know they've been really expensive lately. Because they weren't in season,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	of course, they had to be, be, uh, grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
M:	Oh yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, is that right?
M:	Yeah
B:	Oh, I .
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	So, you know, it's, it, it seems like there's so much of it going on that it's almost frantic, you just don't know what to do.
B:	Well,
M:	What, what, what kind of, what type of, um
B:	Okay, sure,
M:	Yeah, I'm a big, uh, grower, I mean, I have all kinds of growlers and, uh
B:	Is that right? I've never heard of that.
M:	Yeah, but, uh, it's good, it gives you a little more flavor.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And then you, uh, you, you pour the wine over the top of the box and you cover it with foil and then you let it steam.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But it's a good idea.
B:	I think I know what you're is it like a hand held?
M:	Yeah.
B:	The, yeah, okay.
M:	Yeah, I, I've seen those.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh.
M:	You have to mix it with water, and you have to stir it in real carefully.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then I put in, uh.
B:	Oh, wow. That is really interesting. Are you saying to use like, um, for chocolate like, unsweetened,
M:	Uh, no, it doesn't taste like it.
B:	unsweetened?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and it's just a tablespoon of it, and you mix it all together.
B:	I have some
M:	Okay, I guess we're ready to start.
B:	I just want to,
M:	you know, to go back to school and not have to work.
B:	Right. Okay.
M:	It's kind of sweetened up with a little lemon wedge in it, but it's real hard to chew.
B:	Cooking chocolate.
M:	Yeah, I've never tried that. I don't know if you've ever tried that, but it sounds good.
B:	That's really interesting, I've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Well, how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own?
M:	!!! RemindMe!! You've got mail.
B:	Is that right? Oh, neat,
M:	Yeah, so, I found that, um.
B:	that is just really neat. Because I,
M:	I'm a real foodie.
B:	It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good.
M:	Yeah, well, that's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so that you don't have to do, uh, you know, so much work, but, uh
B:	So you put the milk in the cornstarch?
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that now.
B:	And then put that back in the saucepan?
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
B:	Huh that's,
M:	So,
B:	Oh.
M:	And then it's like it's a little bit too much. But,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's just a little bit,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I use that to make the sauce and then I put the chicken over the, over the pan. And then I cover it with foil and pop it in the oven. And pop it into the oven for just a couple of minutes to melt it all up.
B:	Do do you put it in the refrigerator then or
M:	Well, we just put it on the ground.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then, uh you know, just, you know a little bit, uh.
B:	Right, that's true. I knew that.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, that was just,
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I, I don't know.
