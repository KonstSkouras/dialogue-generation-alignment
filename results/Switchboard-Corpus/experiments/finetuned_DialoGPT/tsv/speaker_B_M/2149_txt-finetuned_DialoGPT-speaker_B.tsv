B:	I kind of, I think so, too. I think that's a bit dramatic, but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing, helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think, uh.
B:	Your right, I do, too, I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts a video doing
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right, that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and that got you involved real good and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Something,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	You know, I mean, it's not just that, it, you know, it needs to be more of a, a regular thing for everybody.
B:	I do, too. I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that. And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out. I think that's good and,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	if they give five percent, we'd solve all our problems.
B:	Yeah There you go.
M:	It's a good point.
B:	Right.
M:	yeah, my kids, I don't know, maybe they were just not exposed to the metric system that much.
B:	Yeah, it sounds pretty good That sounds good. I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff, and I think that's pretty neat. They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they clean it up.
M:	Uh, that's good.
B:	And keep it clean. I think that's I pretty good idea. And I think, you know, again I've seen a lot of young kids doing that and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older. I know I did, you know, in Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that
M:	Uh, that's neat.
B:	So, Oh.
M:	!!!%!! translated!! translate!! Remind me of that
B:	Yeah, I'm in Texas. Where are you at?
M:	I'm in Dallas.
B:	New York.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Oh, gosh.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	so I guess we're going to see a lot of snow.
B:	Yeah
M:	I think, I think it's going to be a long way, though.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, no.
M:	So, I mean, it's really bad.
B:	Oh.
M:	And it was really, uh.
B:	Golly.
M:	But we had power. We had four H P M here in McKinney.
B:	Are you serious?
M:	I mean, you could just as easily imagine that they had, had, uh, a revolution.
B:	Oh my God, how do they live?
M:	I don't know, I, I mean, I don't, I know how they live, but, uh, it just seems like they, they don't really have any power. I mean they just sort of, they vote and, uh.
B:	Yeah. I haven't heard a thing.
M:	But I know that there's been talk about building more prisons.
B:	Lord.
M:	And, uh, we've, we were in the process of filling in some forms for our, uh  state.
B:	Well, that's good. That's great.
M:	So, it's, it is a real change.
B:	Right. Yeah.
M:	and, and it's, it's a real problem.
B:	Right.
M:	but, uh, they do, they have the facilities to do it.
B:	and we go along and, I'm really not sure how we find the individuals, but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it, and, uh, we go along with all the material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix whatever we can.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, and spend a day doing, that's really neat. I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time, but you know, every little bit helps.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, yeah. They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material. Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah. And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know so much as, we just want to help people out.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So it's real neat.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's,   Yeah,
M:	And it's, it's like, uh,
B:	it's  like I say, it's not a lot, but it helps people. Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing
M:	Yeah.
B:	and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps, so
M:	Oh, I know. I know, I do it, too. I just can't seem to get over the fact that I need to do it. I don't know why I don trenches. I do all the other stuff.
B:	Yeah.
M:	That helps a lot.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and other ones did, you, you just had to meet people,
B:	Gosh. That's great. That's a lot.
M:	So, I, I think, I mean, I'm not sure, you, you're right, that the, that there is a great deal of responsibility, and I think that, you can see where that comes in handy.
B:	That's, that's a lot of kids, though.
M:	Yeah. I, I know, I think that's the only thing I can think of that's, uh.
B:	Oh, well, still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, and, and it was just, you, you knew, you were going to get into a class that was going to be about the same as theirs.
B:	Yeah. That's neat.
M:	So, that was kind of neat. I, I, uh.
B:	That's great.
M:	So,
B:	That's great. But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, I don't think they should have to do a year
M:	No, I, I agree with that.
B:	Yeah. I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean. They're not worth it
M:	Yeah
B:	Right. Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	And she works in the same kind of station with T V, you don't hear about them.
B:	I couldn't either.
M:	But, uh.
B:	I couldn't either.
M:	Oh, I was just thinking that's what, that's the only thing I can really think of that would really be a crime, you wouldn't know anything about it,
B:	Right, right.
M:	And I think the, the, and I think that the, I think they have a very, I don't know, I, I'm not really sure what the, what the quality of the, of the products they put out are, you're, you have to wonder, you can't, you don't just can't tell.
B:	Yeah. I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and, I mean, she's a teacher and, and just wanted to do it. She'd been a teacher for a while. Just decided she wanted to do it, so. I mean, I'm grateful for people like that, but, I don't see how they can just, Yeah,
M:	I don't either, I think there's so much pressure, I just, I guess, you just have to accept that there's a limit on, on what you can do.
B:	just, pick up and head on out.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I wish I could do something like that, but I can't, so
M:	Well, I think, I've always considered it a hobby.
B:	Right, that's the way I am. I know the feeling.
M:	But, uh, it's a lot of work, I mean, I'm not into sitting around and taping up the whole day, you know.
B:	That's right We're against it That's right.
M:	Yeah.
B:	You, too, and I hope everything works out up there.
M:	Okay.
B:	Yeah.
M:	we're just, we just want to make it through this month,
B:	Good, good, that's great. Yeah. Well, good luck.
M:	Okay, thank you.
B:	Thanks.
M:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye video
