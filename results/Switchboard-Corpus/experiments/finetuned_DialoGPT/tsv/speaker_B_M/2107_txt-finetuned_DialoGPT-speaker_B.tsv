B:	Yes.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!body else got the wrong message. This is a call for help.
B:	Oh okay, you get so attached to them.
M:	Yeah, so, I don't know. I don, I just don't have the time to spend with him.
B:	Oh.
M:	and I had to have my, uh
B:	Oh no.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He'd never seen anybody. He'd never even seen a cat or cat walk around.
B:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, it just, it was just, I thought, I'm going to go, I, I don't know, I just couldn't believe it.
B:	Yes, I understand.
M:	It was, it was just, it's just too perfect, and it's so realistic.
B:	Oh no, I understand, we, uh, we've gone through the same things with ours, we've had, you know, they've been ill, I mean I take off work, to take care of my cats, you know,
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	my boss thinks I'm absolutely crazy. And then we had a baby and it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.
M:	Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
B:	And, and then when we go to sleep at night, you know, it's like my husband and I have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.
M:	Oh, no.
B:	It's like all right, whose corners is this one.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, we're just having a ball with them.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	!!!!,!!!!!
B:	Oh no.
M:	So, I guess that's about it, huh?
B:	Yes, uh-huh, that's it
M:	And he fell into the trap and was eaten.
B:	Right, traumatized for life here.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Oh yeah, we've, all four of ours are house cats.
M:	Uh-hau, oh, gosh.
B:	We started out with two, with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh well he lived through it, oh, I couldn't believe it. We went through like twenty-two hundred dollars worth of vet bills.
M:	Ouch.
B:	The, the cat almost died, and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat, oh he loves life now.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he's like oh, thank you so much.
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	I know, we wondered about that. But, uh, oh that was a traumatic experience for us too.
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	Uh, well, uh, from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip.
M:	Um.
B:	Oh yes, absolutely nuts. But, uh, luckily enough, you know, we found the cat in time and, uh, rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery and,
M:	Oh boy.
B:	I mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
M:	Oh, no.
B:	But oh, he's been a wonderful cat.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh yes. But, uh, we wouldn't we wouldn't have them, I mean, I don't see us without pets, without cats.
M:	Well, I think that, uh...
B:	There's just, uh, there's this, they just fill this void.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yes.
M:	but,
B:	Oh no.
M:	But, you know, I, I don't know, they just, I guess they have to do something different. I donno, I can see it from both directions.
B:	Right and you worry about, oh, who's taking care of them.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And that's it, you know.
B:	Right, well I didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until I brought one home one night. We, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, well I fell in love with this, uh, it's a Chinchilla Persian, and, uh, brought him home,
M:	Uh.
B:	and oh, my husband just died.
M:	Oh, my.
B:	It was like we can't take it back you've got, we've got to keep it now.
M:	Well, that's, that, that is a problem.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.
M:	And, uh, you know, I, I just, I don't know, uh.
B:	Oh uh-huh.
M:	And it's right there on the Taco Bell, and, and it's just gorgeous, and the kids love it.
B:	Right.
M:	I'll call one and let them know that I'm there.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	So he called and she said, oh, I don't know. I'll let you go.
B:	Oh.
M:	She was the one that got hit by that bus.
B:	Right, right.
M:	But, um, I think, I mean, I don't know, I'm not a real big exerciser or anything, but I do, I do do do like to, to do, to stretch out and, and, uh, and play a lot of tennis.
B:	Oh no.
M:	He'll nurse you on your feet, but he's just a wonderful, wonderful, caring dog.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	He is, he is, uh, he's the sweetest little thing. People that, you know, don't know him but they love him. They, they really do.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, he's, he is a little poodle.
B:	Oh that's good. Oh we just, uh, just love them. They, uh, you know, get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's like oh, your claws need trimming.
M:	Uh-hauhuh, uh.
B:	Oh yes, yes.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Oh it just drives us nuts.
M:	Yeah, it drives me nuts. I just don't like it.
B:	Um, yeah.
M:	and, uh, she was always the best, best, most loving dog I've ever had.
B:	They really are. The cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog.
M:	Yeah, they really are, yeah, but I think, uh, the, the cats can get a lot out of control.
B:	And, but oh, they're so much fun to watch them play.
M:	I know. I just, I just love watching them.
B:	Yes.
M:	So, I've got a couple of cats, and I'm, I'm always scouting out cat shows.
B:	Oh, we've got, well the two that were outside, they're like brothers, I mean I've never seen two cats so close.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they, uh, will get to playing chase through the house,
M:	Oh.
B:	and it is hysterical, I mean and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit. It's like this train.
M:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	I mean it sounds like a train. We have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house
M:	Oh, gosh.
B:	Oh no, they're just, they're, they're just, uh, they're wonderful, uh.
M:	Well, I have a, a dog and a cat, and I, you know, I don't really have any, any love for either one of them, so, but, uh
B:	Uh, we have, uh, Bonzo, Bear, Poindexter, and Felix.
M:	Okay, what kind of dogs do you have?
B:	And what do you have.
