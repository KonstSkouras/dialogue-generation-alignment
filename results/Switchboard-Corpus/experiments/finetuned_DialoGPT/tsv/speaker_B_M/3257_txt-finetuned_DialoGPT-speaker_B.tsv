B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then we have a, a regular Monday night soap opera, and then, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but we start with the first one and then we go to, uh, STAR TREK FOUR.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, it's just, I just don't have time to watch it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I try to catch it, you know, at five o'clock when I get home from work.
B:	Monday night's pretty good with MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING WOMEN.
M:	Oh, yeah, those are good too.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I just love the, the different ways they try and play.
B:	Uh-huh. We had watched it, uh, I guess Sunday night and Monday night, but we didn't get to watch it tonight.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh
B:	The only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights, starting fairly late, like I'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight. They have some British comedy that we've, we've really liked,
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	and there's a variety. Some of them is, uh, BLACK ADDER or GOOD NEIGHBORS or YES, PRIME MINISTER and ARE YOU BEING SERVED? They, they rotate those around, and, um, we like that British comedy. British comedy is very fast, you really have to listen
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	but.
M:	I like, I like to watch a little bit of comedy, especially when it's on the teller, you know.
B:	They're real good, but they do come on kind of late, but we really do enjoy those. Sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the Discovery Channel.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm amazed sometimes what I see on there. But I'm very intrigued. I, one time I was watching an operation, and I thought, Gee, I don't believe I'm watching.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and he said it was horrible, and it was really a shame, because I, I,
B:	Yeah, right, right,
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	they like to watch animals, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	you know, it's a good show.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	so they were on a cruise.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	so we, we watch, uh
B:	Right. Yeah, I'm not into watching sports. Now my husband likes to watch football, he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much, but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes to watch college on Saturday, and then of course Cowboys on Sunday.
M:	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	we'll have to, we'll have have to just keep on with it.
B:	Um.
M:	but he'd already done that before he took off.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	we don't have cable.
B:	Um.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	Yeah, the, you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff
M:	Yeah.
B:	yeah, those are pretty good but true to life,
M:	Yeah.
B:	I mean, some of the,
M:	I, I don't know, I, I think that, I mean, it's, it seems like there's so much going on that, that, you know, you kind of, you don't, you can't just go and, and, you're not sure, you, you just, you have to go by yourself,
