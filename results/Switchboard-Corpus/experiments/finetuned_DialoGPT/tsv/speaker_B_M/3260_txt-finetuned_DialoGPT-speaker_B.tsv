M:	And so I have a lot of friends that commute to work from home. And so I get to see a lot more of the children and a lot less of the adults.
B:	Yes Yes. Yeah.
M:	I, I think that's great.
B:	Uh, well, uh, yeah. We 've spend a spend a did spend a lot of time, uh, it really helped when the, uh, older one was old enough to get his license and could, uh drive around by himself although that brought in a whole other set of problems.
M:	Well, I think that's a wonderful thing to do. I think, uh.
B:	But, uh, I, uh, yeah, for one thing. Uh, but yeah, we, uh, we do but our two had, had, uh, totally different interests of, but there was not much, uh, overlap as such. The, the older one is not, was not at all into, uh, sports for the most part. Uh, he participated band and, and, uh, scouts were his two big things.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh and the, yeah, younger one is, uh, uh, the sports one and the, whatever season it is he's, he's playing, although football is really his favorite
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah. So, uh, yeah, we spend a lot of time, uh, uh, carpooling and, uh, you know, and then trying to be, uh, up as much as possible with anything that they, that they do.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	But then, uh, we also didn't do , spend, uh, time with them trying to, trying to, uh, you know, just family time.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, we had a, at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth. And, and, uh, uh, but we didn't, uh, do it as much or as often as, uh, I would have liked to. I would like to do that as a, as a family and, and some T V watching.

B:	I've never actually, never actually played it. But,
M:	Oh, that's, that sounds interesting.
B:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	So, I said, you know, we'll just wait and see if she moves out. But I just, you just don't know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, it was really fun for them.
B:	Yeah.
M:	We're a big baseball fan, so we go to a lot games here.
B:	Yeah, so do we.
M:	Uh, we do a lot like to drive, too. Uh, my husband's family lives in Lubbock, and we take a lot to go to the movies there.
B:	Okay. Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I think we do get enough of that in Texas.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And so, I, I'm really, really into that.
B:	Oh, now that's neat.
M:	So we have, we have a lot in common.
B:	Yeah. No, we've never had anything like that.
M:	So, that's good.
B:	Yeah.
M:	That's neat, you know, so, you don't have to do anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's kind of nice because I'm not, I don't have to mess with it, you know,
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, well, good. Well, I, you know, in terms of, in terms of any sorts of trends I, you know, obviously things are different from, for me than, and my children than when I was growing up.
M:	Right.
B:	I, I, I grew up on a farm, uh, in Iowa, and, uh, you know the whole family was around the, the whole time. And then what my father did was, was, uh, you know, obvious to me and I, I helped out with it. But, uh, although I have brought my boys into to see where I work, it's not that easy, and it's, it's certainly not at all common, and they, they just don't really have that same idea,
M:	Uh,
B:	so they, uh, it's a, it's a whole different, uh, kind of thing there then, uh,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes it hard though for in terms of, you know, family time with, with him.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, uh, don't travel too much .
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I'm sure he's missed a lot of, um,  the social changes that have occurred in the last, um.
B:	Yes.
M:	but, uh, I think, uh I think they're doing a lot of research and, uh and, and, you know, getting a lot more involved.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh,
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	But, uh, you're right, you can't just do that every day.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, right.
M:	I know it.
