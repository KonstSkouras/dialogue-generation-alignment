B:	It is. Have you been living there very long?
M:	Yes.
B:	So you've been there longer. We built this one about, uh, it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago,
M:	Yeah. I remember my parents, uh.
B:	and we subcontracted it out ourselves. We bought the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications
M:	Uh.
B:	and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little over six years now. And uh, have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in.
M:	Uh, are you a, are, are your, uh...
B:	My husband got his big garage. He we have a three car garage, that he has a big work area in
M:	Uh.
B:	and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and, so he has all the work space he needs.
M:	Yeah.
B:	He,
M:	and, uh,
B:	It is, and that's why we decided to build. We looked at things that were already, uh, built
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and the garages were always, if the house was large, it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have.
M:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	So we put a three car garage in.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a work space. All of it was taken up with just car space.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on.
M:	Oh, wow.
B:	Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.
M:	Yeah, my husband and I have, well, we both have a big family, but I think my husband is more into the sewing and the garage work.
B:	Oh, I see.
M:	So,
B:	Uh-huh. Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.
M:	No, it's in his, um, his garden, and, and he has plants, and trees, and his, my sister has trees, so, but I don't have any, so I'm not really out of the gardening business.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I, I do like to have my eyes open and listen to music and, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they would come in and tell me how to do it and I'd be like, no, this isn't really very good.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh, they were selling it and, uh they were going to sell it to me for seventy-five,
B:	Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come home.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come. His parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay
M:	Uh.
B:	and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.
M:	Well, that's true.
B:	Right. Oh, I understand
M:	So, it's been a real good couple of years for that.
B:	Well, we, That's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room.
M:	That's true.
B:	Well, I I haven't reached that point yet. I've heard people say that. But, uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while.
M:	Oh, that's great.
B:	He's out of college and has a good job,
M:	Yeah.
B:	so he could afford to get married but, is not engaged yet,
M:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while, but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first.
M:	Uh, that's good.
B:	That's what she plans to do.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	So, I hope so.
M:	Yeah, I'm sure it will.
B:	Oh, ho-ho.
M:	And, uh, we were real lucky because my husband had, you know, the extended family, you could have a reunion there.
B:	A whole new world. Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, so that's a good thing to do.
B:	I can understand.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I like to, uh, catch the news on the way to work.
B:	Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren.
M:	Oh, I do too.
B:	Um, uh-huh
M:	But, uh,
B:	Well, we have,
