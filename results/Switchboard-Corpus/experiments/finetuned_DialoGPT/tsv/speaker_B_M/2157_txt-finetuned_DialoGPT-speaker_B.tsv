B:	Well, they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.
M:	Boy, they are, they really are.
B:	At least they're coming around.
M:	That's right.
B:	Well I mean, you know, I think, uh, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, uh, they'll do all right.
M:	I don't think so.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh.
B:	I'm a Viking fan.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	And they haven't been doing too hot, so.
M:	Well, that's good. I like to watch the, the Minnesota sports. I used to watch a lot of college, a lot college teams, but I don t have cable.
B:	No, in fact, in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	I've never been over impressed with him.
M:	He's been a good athlete, but, uh, I've never seen him hit.
B:	Well, who's the running, is it Sammy Smith, or is it, Emmett Smith.
M:	Uh, it's Sam, uh, Sam the, the one that used to play for the Cowboys.
B:	Emmett Smith.
M:	Yeah, I'm not sure who he's playing now.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, I just, I think it's, it's a very important time to be a quarterback, and, uh.
B:	I'm not sure.
M:	He's been pretty good.
B:	Who else is, uh, oh there's, you know, Mike , Minnesota Vikings, used to be the general manager starting the World Football League.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So, and and he was trying to keep, uh, uh, I can't even think of the guy's name, either, the coach of the Vikings.
M:	Oh, yeah, he's, uh-huh.
B:	Jerry Burns.
M:	Okay, I know who you're talking about.
B:	he was going to keep him as the coach somehow, but, uh, I don't know, I'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow.
M:	Oh, yeah, they've got a quarterback.
B:	Well, they started out really bad, they went like one and six, and then they won five or six in a row.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	Yeah, I guess you can,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but I don t remember them being so highly up and down.
B:	And the Cardinals were kind of like the in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys, and the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season, and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys, so.
M:	Yeah, they were, they just, they, they didn't do too bad last year.
B:	Oh, don't made any excuses for him
M:	No, no.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know. I know, I, I can't remember who it is.
B:	I don't know Yeah I think it was .
M:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, well I got my thirty day notice yesterday.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	Um, I'm done, where I work.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	So, anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that, but I just thought I'd throw that in there
M:	Well, that's okay.
B:	Oh, I've always ran out of time ever since I've done this.
M:	Yeah, well, I was just going to say, I think I've, I, I agree with that, and, uh, you know, I have a hard time thinking that, that, uh...
B:	They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Make sure we get our cash flow.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Um, actually, when I was younger, I was a Cardinal fan, too.
M:	Cardinals?
B:	Remember Jim Hart? Jim Hart was playing. Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals. This was a long time ago.
M:	Right.
B:	Um, I don't know who else I've ever. That's about it, I was always a Viking fan. I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit and,
M:	Well, you know, I think, I mean, I, I went to Minnesota when I lived in Wisconsin. I lived there for a year and a half.
B:	Yes, oh, of course.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah, well, the Cowboys were America's football team,
M:	Yeah.
B:	there's no question about that, so.
M:	Well, I, I think the Cowboys have been a lot of fun to watch this year.
B:	Again.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	What are they going up to, thirty bucks or something?
M:	I don't know.
B:	So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	That's interesting, I almost lost our electricity here .
M:	Oh, it is.
