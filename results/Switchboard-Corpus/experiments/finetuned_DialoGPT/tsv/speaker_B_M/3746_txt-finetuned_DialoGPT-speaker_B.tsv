B:	Well, we live, uh, pretty close, to the Mesquite Golf Course.
M:	Oh, uh-hoh.
B:	So, we will play either out there or at Firewheel. That is usually where we play, but I have played you know different courses in in the Dallas area.
M:	Well that is neat. What is your favorite golf course?
B:	Uh, both
M:	Yeah.
B:	Not at the same time.
M:	But I, I, uh.
B:	No, sometimes we ride and sometimes, uh, we, pull, we like to, to, uh, a lot of the times just walk, uh, for the exercise. But
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	I find that when I ride in a cart, I play better and I think it is cause I don't get as tired
M:	Uh, that's true.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I, I guess I'm kind of, uh. I guess it's more a matter of, you know, I don, I can't go out and do something and, you, I'm not really motivated
B:	I know, and that makes me so mad You know, it is like it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But I was, I was so mad when I got called back. I was just like, God, I'm mad.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right. Well, the reason why we play over there is because its where, since we are a Garland resident, they gave us a special deal where you can get, uh, ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars, yeah, a hundred dollars cause it is half price what the normal green fees are.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that is why we you know play over there cause we have got our card
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, do you? So you live in Garland then.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Okay, well we are in south Garland, but yeah, next time you go, uh, you know, check into it, they have, uh, it is just like, uh, a bus card and they just punch it. You know, it has got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	And so I have, I am in the process of quitting that and going into a company that is hiring more people.
B:	You must have a, a son.
M:	Yeah. He is three.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh well that sounds like fun too
M:	Yeah, it is, it's really neat.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, you need to, uh, teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you
M:	Uh, well, that's true, I, I've, uh I've always done that, but I've just recently, uh
B:	Oh, yeah. Well you can teach them
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Right, Right. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh
B:	Uh-huh. Right. Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right. Yeah, I know what you mean
M:	And that is,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Oh yeah. It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Well flower gardens. I like to have, matter of fact this past weekend I just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs. So, those ought to be coming up around spring time
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I had to get all those off. And, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh, they do great. I put mine in probably in November.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I think it was November and I don't do anything to mine, water them or anything And they just, they do really good and I even had, uh, I guess it was last year or the year before, I had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible, but they came back later. I didn't do anything to them so they are, uh, they are good to plant in the winter time. They last for a long time then. So, if you start putting them, you know, you can put them out in the spring too, but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them cause they can't stand the hot weather.
M:	Well, I have, I do some water aerobics.
B:	No, they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot, but they make it through probably winter and spring. So,
M:	Oh, that's good.
B:	Yeah, I have got some of those too, cause I love flowers
M:	Uh, what kind of trees do you have?
B:	Yeah. And I do, I try to do some arts and crafts and I love to go,
