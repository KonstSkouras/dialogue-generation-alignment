B:	Surely.
M:	So, I think that's one of the reasons that we have so many problems with, uh
B:	You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?
M:	Well, no, not really. We've had some, uh. We had some hail, uh in the forecast for about an hour or so, and, um, we were watching for hail.
B:	Right. I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, really
M:	Yeah, so,
B:	Yeah. Actually, I'm a California born person.
M:	I see.
B:	I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about. In L A, it's pretty bad.
M:	Yeah, it is.
B:	Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City.
M:	Oh, okay, okay
B:	Yes.
M:	Oh.
B:	The worst one for smog is Mexico City.
M:	Oh, really? Oh, yeah, well, I guess, I don't know. I guess you just have to look at it from the south, because we're so heavily polluted down there that, uh
B:	The most polluted city in the world
M:	Yeah.
B:	. Yeah. I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	You ever heard of that?
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah. Methanol?
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	Yeah. Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
M:	!!!%
B:	Uh, that's one thing that they do. At that, it's pretty easy to do.
M:	Yeah, it is.
B:	And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that.
M:	Yeah.
B:	It doesn't make sense. Uh, but it's, you know, one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world  is corn.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
M:	But I think that's the only thing that you can't.
B:	Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that. It's interesting. They're, they're looking at, there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off.
M:	Right.
B:	Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy
M:	Uh, no.
B:	Unlike a car where it's running.
M:	Right.
B:	A electric car it's on demand. I mean it's either on or off.
M:	Oh, my.

B:	You don't have to shift So you, cars become very simple all  of a sudden too.
M:	Right.
