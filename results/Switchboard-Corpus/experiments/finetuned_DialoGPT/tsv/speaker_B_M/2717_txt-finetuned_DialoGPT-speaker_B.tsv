B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, I donno, I'm not sure if they have it up there. I don, I think it's up there where you actually have to register as a capital case.
B:	Yeah. Uh-huh, well from what I I saw a statistic just a few days ago, um, so far this year, or was it during the last year, during a year's time, I think it was they executed twenty-five people in the nation. Meanwhile, there were twenty-five hundred people on death row. So I, I, and it's building up, you know, they're, they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up.
M:	It's getting to be a big problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And some of the people that are in there now, I don't know, are still on death Row.
B:	Yeah, everybody's got that.
M:	I mean, you can't, you don't know, there's no room for all of them.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's not just the prison people, it is the society in general.
B:	Yeah. Isn't, isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was.
M:	Oh, yeah, I remember that. I think it was,  it was on the news a little bit,  a couple of days ago.
B:	It was, uh, that was the one that was used so much in the campaign. In the in the presidential race. Uh, may, it may not have been Maryland. It may have been Massachusetts, I don't remember.
M:	I don't know. I've only been up here a couple of weeks and I can barely remember what the, uh, the,
B:	Anyway, well the question is, you know, do you think, it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	If it,
M:	But I think they're going to be, you, you have to think about, uh.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	You know, I mean it's just,
B:	Yeah. Well I think in large measure the reason they don't care, it's not because the punishment, but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished.
M:	Right.
B:	The police don't catch them, or the courts don't convict them, or, or they don't serve very much of the time and so, uh, you know, their, their success rate is very high. Crime does pay, you can make a good living at it.
M:	Uh-uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, you don't know, you're right, they may have just been caught and, uh
B:	Last year it was D C, I guess Baltimore caught them.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	and it's just not, it doesn't, it isn't anywhere near as much of a deterrent as it once was.
B:	Yeah.
M:	you know, they have to get a, a, get a new one
B:	Yeah, the only consolation is so many of the murders are, you know, the, the violent people going against each other and so they, you know, society's not going to put them to death, well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to. Uh, I think, I think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say, you know, this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society, not temporarily, but permanently.
M:	!!! Remind me of that.
B:	I mean, I, I personally think life imprisonment, I don't think much of of life imprisonment. First of all, it's never, turns out to be life, but second, you know, why should we, the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole. Well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again, well then, why bother. Just execute them, because that's, that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again.
M:	Well, that's true, I know, I have a friend who's a, a, uh, a prison fanatic and, uh she's sentenced to death for, for like, uh theft of property.
B:	So any, any, anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole, I'd say, uh, give them the death penalty So,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah, and, and also, um, the, the thing I don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence, what can I hide and what do I have to tell.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are.
M:	Well, that's true, too.
B:	And, and that way we can be sure, you know, we can find out the truth, we can find out what really happened and, and base the sentence on what the person did, not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	and he was trying to decide between, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But he was killed by a stray bullet.
B:	Just started shooting people,  because they botched the first job
M:	Right.
B:	and,  so now they're going to get even.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, you know,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, it's, it was really a tough issue, but I think that, uh you know you have to do, you have a background check to make sure that you're buying something right, and that, you, you don't, you can't say that it's not authentic.
B:	So what was the verdict, what was the results there.
M:	Well, the result was that, uh the, the defendant did not have a defense.
B:	Oh.
M:	He was found not guilty of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, I, I'm not sure that, that, I mean, I've heard it, but I haven't, you know, I haven tought about it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	The, the penalty phase, yeah, they've, decide the penalty separately from the verdict.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah, well, you know, you just have to decide, you know, well there's really two separate decisions there I guess, one is, did it really happen the way the, the prosecutor said it happened, you know, is this man really guilty, and you have to decide that, but then you have to decide, you know, as a member of society what do I want to do with this guy who did this thing.
M:	Well, that, that would be a good idea.
B:	And that I, I've never been on a jury, I've never had that experience, I'm not sure I'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, I, uh
B:	Uh-huh
M:	I, I think that's probably one of the worst things I've ever seen happen.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Well the thing I'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence. I mean, I can handle people, people selling drugs, you know, it's, it's wrong, but it, it's not worth somebody getting executed for. But we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody, you know, these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing.
M:	Well, it can be. It can be, it really can be a, a very, very bad thing. I think that, uh
B:	And the people I'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life. That, you know, you, never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And so I go, these are the kind of people I would like to get out of here and get out of circulation and say I don't, we don't accept your kind in our society.
M:	That's right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
