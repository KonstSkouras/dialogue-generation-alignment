M:	Okay.
B:	so, yeah.
M:	but, um, we're, we have, we've had a lot of, uh, real problems with, uh with pension funds in the past, you can't always get a good pension.
B:	Uh, we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know, remodeled.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It had been, you know, of course, a farm.

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, um, we're just north of Baltimore, so.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then we moved to, uh, Utah and then, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but they have a radio station down there that plays, uh, country and western
B:	Uh-huh.

B:	Uh, Grapevine, do you know Grapevine?
M:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
B:	Yeah, my brother has a home there he's trying to sell. He, he's living now up, uh, in, in Maryland but, uh, he, lived in Grapevine for a long time.
M:	Oh, yeah, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Oh, it's terrible. I,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that one.

B:	Uh, right, right. Right, right.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etwork!! Remind me of that.
B:	Yeah, yeah, it's not good
M:	I, I, I think I'm one of the few people, you, you have to watch your children and, and your wife and your children, and, uh, just everything, you don't have to worry about, you've got to be careful.
B:	And the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live and, uh, of course, most of the homes are, you know, fairly nice, they're, uh, done up fairly nice, uh,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right, uh-huh, Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, I don't know what the, what the actual, uh laws are on that. I know that in California they're really strict about it.
B:	Well, prices have come down on the homes, the duplexes.
M:	yeah, and the price has gone down and the, the price of houses has gone up and the prices of homes have gone down.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	they're, they have a lot of space between them.
B:	Oh, my heaven.
M:	So,
B:	Well, I know up in Connecticut the same thing happened, people are devastated because they paid so much for their home.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But we like our area. It, like I said, it's, it's an old house and everything
M:	Uh-hauhuh.
B:	but, uh,
M:	Yeah, we have, uh we have a couple of hundred acres,
B:	Well, we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh north.
M:	Uh, my husband and I, we live in Plano actually.
B:	And yeah, and it's, it's really not, you know, not that far.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Bradford's north of us.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, no.
M:	Okay.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We're in Plano actually.
B:	Well, we've been here since sixty-six.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh, we have fifty acres.
M:	Wow, that's quite a territory.
B:	Oh, pardon me, we have forty, we gave ten to one of our children
M:	!!!% Well, that's, you know, that, that is, that would be one way to do it.
B:	No, not really, and, and towns keep creeping closer and closer, you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and they were trying to sell it to people that live in the lower, upper districts,
B:	Yeah, it's ours up here. We have, our rural connections are real bad
M:	Uh.
B:	But we, but we live about ten miles from probably three or four, not large towns but, you know, reasonable.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, I think we're going to have to do something about, about that because our economy is really hurting.
B:	Uh, yeah, we're tired of doing it though. We, we don't want to do too much more
M:	Oh.
B:	Uh, oh, golly, I really.
M:	Oh, you don't have that many.
B:	We have, uh, uh, four rooms downstairs, and a pantry
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and upstairs we have a bath, a bath, oh we, have a half bath downstairs, too.
M:	Oh, wow.
B:	We have a bath upstairs, and one, two, three, four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room And, uh,
M:	How many people do you have?
B:	Pardon?
M:	I have a four year old and a three year old.
B:	Well, it really isn't too big yet. We, we a lot of people say that but, um, it's,
M:	Well what do you think about the proposal that all young people should spend thirty years in the military?
B:	we just like it real well Yeah,
M:	Well I think we've accomplished a little bit here.
B:	we had five children, so and they've all moved you know, on.
M:	Oh, that's great.
B:	They're all out on their own now.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we have, um.
B:	Well, it sounds like a good buy.
M:	It is.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, um, you know, you can always get a one time accidental fee or something like that.
B:	Oh, that makes a big difference.
M:	and, um.
B:	Uh-huh. You really aren't isolated because it's, the advantages, your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people,
M:	Uh, I think that's right.
B:	but yet you can have your friends, uh, you can have them in, you can go out.
M:	Right, right.
B:	You have more of a choice, you're not pressed upon as bad.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, you know, they're, they've got their own little retirement communities and things like that.
B:	Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	so I would rather live in, uh
B:	More luxury. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	it's, it has a lot more amenities, you can have more, you get more storage capacity and, uh, it, it is more efficient.
B:	Right, yeah.
M:	and, uh, it has the, uh the windows in the back, and, uh it has, uh you know, the, the light, the whole thing.
B:	Uh, they're, yeah, I suppose they are now. We, both of our children who live there have just bought a home. Uh, in the Mount Lebanon area.
M:	Oh, uh.
B:	And, uh, the one, the one boy, the house they bought is completely livable. They didn't have to do much to it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	The other one is, uh, uh, has, you know, needs more work done. It's twenty years old, I think.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And, but they have two children, too, and they, they bought what they could afford.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
B:	They are beautiful homes.
M:	they are.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	Okay, what is the name of the home that you are thinking about?
B:	It is, it's real nice.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I mean, I don't know, I, I guess I'm, I'm not too up-to-date on the, the housing situation down there.
B:	Oh, my you you do when you When we first got married, uh, my husband works for the state, and we moved once a year usually
M:	Uh.
B:	And then after they had to start paying to move us, that suddenly wasn't necessary any more
M:	Oh.
B:	Right, yeah, you have to stop some place, yeah.
M:	I know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, it's like, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. I do too,
M:	But, uh, I think, you, you can get some really good bargains on those.
B:	I've heard too many people say, I hate it here.
M:	Yeah. I know, I know. It's, it's, uh, it just seems like it's so dry, and, and the grass just dries up and dies.
B:	You know, they buy a place and they just hate the area.
M:	Well, that's, that, that would be true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's just not going to be able to support itself.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, well, my brother, they're having trouble selling their home, see.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Right, uh-huh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, the, the properties, the one that I live in, uh they just bought a, uh a third of the house they had.
B:	Oh, uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	You know, it was like, you know, if you were, if, if your kid was small, like I was, I was going to send him to a school that was smaller, and I was hoping that maybe, you, you could send him, you can send him somewhere that is not small, and he'd be happy with what he did, but, you're right, that, that's not, that doesn't make any difference, because it's not like it's, it, it doesn't, it wouldn't make a difference to him.
B:	I, I couldn't handle that
M:	Yeah, you're right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I know that, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, you can see the leaves change color there.
B:	I get tired, uh, sometimes, mowing, because we mow, you know, a good bit of ground around the house area.
M:	!!!% Well, we're going to have to do that.
B:	And I do get tired of that but, uh, I don't know, I don't think I'd want to change it.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah, I guess I would too.
