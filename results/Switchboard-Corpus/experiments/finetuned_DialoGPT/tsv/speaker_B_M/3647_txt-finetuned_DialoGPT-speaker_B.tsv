B:	Yes, we're not too long distance today.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Oh, that was good. Utah, I've had a couple of, but that was it.
M:	Yeah, I, I just, uh, I'm trying to think of the other one that I've seen recently that was pretty good was, uh. I don't know if you saw that one.
B:	Yeah.
M:	What part of the country are you from?
B:	Learned about their basketball team
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, Jazz.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah.
M:	They're, they're a really good team.
B:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	I am.
M:	Oh, that's great.
B:	Okay.
M:	All right, well, I think we're all ready
B:	Nancy.
M:	Nina.
B:	Right.
M:	Okay. Well, we're supposed to be talking about advice about child care.
B:	Right.
M:	And I'm Gene Hackman.
B:	Right.
M:	What do you think about the, uh, benefits of the working for a large corporation?
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job.
M:	Uh,
B:	I'm a nurse and I work,
M:	Uh.
B:	I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that.
M:	Yeah.
B:	So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that.
M:	Yeah, that's, that, that sounds good to me. I think that's really a, a good way to do it.
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah, it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace.
M:	Uh-hums. Right.
B:	And then I have my freedom. I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do.
M:	Uh-hums.
B:	Well, it is to me. Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I'm just really not interested in all that.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I, I, I guess I'm, I'm more interested in what's going on in the world than what's actually happening.
B:	Right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah. Right, and especially if you have a family.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Then I think it makes a big difference.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, I think that's really important.
B:	Right.
M:	I don't know, I, I think that's good.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	and, and, uh.
B:	Right. Could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week?
M:	Uh, I felt like I could make my own schedule and, and work out, and, uh I found that, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Uh, I've got to have flexible hours.
B:	Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so
M:	Yeah, that, that would be good, too.
B:	I just prefer to worry about today, probably not a practical attitude but that's who I am so,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I'm not sure that I would want my kids to go to day care
B:	Right.
M:	and, uh.
