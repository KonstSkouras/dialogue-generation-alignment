B:	Right
M:	and we all enjoy it. Um.
B:	Well, I, I really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, a little bit for the price,
M:	Yeah.
B:	but, uh, I think that as far as quality of food goes the some of the most expensive places I've been had the the, really the, the worst quality of food.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etingrange!!ival!! There you go.
B:	Really. Um, a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.
M:	Um.
B:	Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside or inside of a place that we drove up and I was like, I'm not eating in there Are you nuts? And, uh, we went in and it was the it was the most wonderful food.
M:	I bet.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	I'm serious.
M:	Really?
B:	Um, a lot of, uh, one place that we went just recently uh, was to Atchafalaya.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, that's not right. That's not right. That's not right.
M:	That's not even right. Um, I, I think that's the worst thing I think we could come up with. I think, I mean, I don't know, it just, I'm not sure what the criteria are. I guess I, it's, I guess it's not just, you know, I don't know. I mean I do, I have not been in the situation where, uh.
B:	someone in the What's the name of that restaurant? in the background Where at? . someone in the background The Hari Krishna. in the background relies Oh. Kalachandji's . Kalachandji's. It's all vegetarian, and it, it was just fabulous. I mean, my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.
M:	!!!;!!et!!You sound like you're a real cookbook freak.
B:	Um, Kalachandji's. It's, uh, it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant.
M:	Oh.
B:	Yes.
M:	!!!eston!!I've never been there.
B:	Uh, I think so. It should be.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Uh, it starts with a K.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	So K A L A, I think, C H A N D.
M:	Right.
B:	That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it. I think it's, uh, probably listed in the restaurants, you know.
M:	Yeah, it is, it's in the, uh-huh menu.
B:	But it's, uh, it's just fabulous food.
M:	Oh, I love their food. My husband really likes it.
B:	Well, we like Arby's. As far as, fast food goes.
M:	Oh, yes.
B:	Oh, really? Why?
M:	Because they're, they're terrible.
B:	Oh, no, no, no. Someone has been lying to you. What they use is roast beef.
M:	Yeah.
B:	That's what, Oh, my goodness.
M:	And they said, well, you know, it's, it is, it was like roast, but it's not like, like, uh, beef, you put in the rice, and you put, uh.
B:	I'm surprised. My dad worked for Arby's for several years.
M:	Arby's, I wonder why.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Well, that's happened before.
M:	Yeah, and it's happened a lot.
B:	But we like good uh, we're, we like Mexican food.
M:	Yeah. Oh, that sounds good.
B:	And stuff like that. And so, um,
M:	What, what kind of Mexican food do you like?
B:	A health food?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Like, like, name one
M:	Yeah, I don't know, I, I think I've seen them, uh
B:	I'm not sure what you're talking about.
M:	Uh, I don't know, I guess it's just like, you know, the health food is just so expensive, you can't afford it.
B:	Huh.
M:	And it's a very health- inspiring restaurant.
B:	I don't guess I've ever been to anything like that so, I really don't have anything to compare it to.
M:	Yeah.
B:	It would be good I think,
M:	yeah, I don't know if you've ever heard of them but,
B:	uh, I don't know how expensive they are. It sounds like that it would probably,
M:	Yeah, I think that would be a really good idea.
B:	For one person?
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh
M:	But, uh, you know, I think we're going to get, we're getting ready to get a, a new one. We've got a, we've got, a nine month old, and we're, we, we get ready to, to get her to start kindergarten next year.
B:	A bit
M:	!!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah, I, I won't really be interested in going to, in going there. Because, I feel like I'm, I'm paying, you know, five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that I could get along quite well without
M:	Yeah
B:	Yeah. Maybe, maybe that. Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. I could see that, then maybe.
M:	Well it's, it's just a matter of how you look at it. You know, if I were, I would say that I would probably say that the people who are really committed to the cause, uh, are not going to pay any taxes are not paying a substantial amount in taxes.
B:	Yeah, I like the, the seafood that they, when they had it, you know, the broiled,
M:	Uh.
B:	Yeah. Probably that's true. But I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things, that you can't really get away from the fried,
M:	Yeah
B:	Now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken?
M:	Well it's good, it's just good for you, it has a good, uh
B:	That's one of my husband's pet peeves. He doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak, you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	Yeah, they're, they were really, uh, you would have to be, uh.
B:	Oh, catfish is wonderful.
M:	I have never eaten catfish.
B:	Oh, really.
M:	Yeah, and I love that.
B:	Really.
M:	and, uh, you know, they've, they, they check for drugs.
B:	Why?
M:	they have a place at Resurrection Lutheran Church that will accept you as an alternate
B:	Oh. Huh.
M:	And, uh, I mean, I'm not a great fisher but I'm, I, I don't, I guess I'm a good enough person to, to go and catch fish. I don'm.
B:	That's too bad, because I'm probably not going to stop eating it
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	And I, I, and I have been very, very, uh...
B:	That's true.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh, on one hand I see that and on the other hand, uh, my older sister remembers when, uh, at one point they were taking radioactive wastes and storing them in tin barrels which I guess, had a half-life of, oh, five years if they sit empty on dry land.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hum. Uh, yes.
B:	So they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically.
M:	Oh.
B:	And then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more.
M:	!!!% Well, that's true.
B:	Oh. And then they wouldn't think. They were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And this is before I was born.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, I mean we're taking thirty years ago, this happened,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and, and who's, you know, the tuna is radioactive to a certain extent.
M:	Right.
B:	You can't get away from it so I think, To some point,
M:	so,
B:	yeah, you know. So there's, you know, there's some things I think we can we, you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like, you know, this is not in my control.
M:	Yeah, well, I don't know. I don, I, I think that, uh, it's, it, it just seems like it's just, it seems like there's just so much going on that it's almost overwhelming when you think of it.
B:	So I'm either going to be, I'm either going to starve to death or I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can, you know.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
