M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, it wasn't really. It was, um, uh, to see an old relative.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No. The only thing that I, I visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is Cancun, Mexico.
M:	Oh, is that right?
B:	And that was real nice. Uh,
M:	Oh, that's not too far.
B:	No, we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there.
M:	Oh, I would love to, uh, go on a safari over there. I love to go anywhere.
B:	Yeah, and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit, from our daily routine.
M:	!!!%!!;!! translated We, uh, we were just, uh we were out on a cruise, uh back in, in, uh in, Florida, back in June, and, uh
B:	Huh.
M:	I enjoyed it.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. Oh, that's always refreshing to get away from.
M:	Yeah. It is.
B:	Oh, well, that's nice. Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity, and that's canoeing.
M:	Oh.
B:	And, uh, they've been to the Guadalupe River, and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, I guess Colorado, and they've really enjoyed it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's a whole new, Uh-huh.
M:	Uh, and, uh.
B:	Huh.
M:	I love it. I, I just don't think there's any place I would want to go to that's been open.
B:	Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	and, and, and it, it was just beautiful. I mean, it really was.
B:	Oh, that's neat. Sure.
M:	so we would just go up there, and have a picnic lunch and, you know, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so that was a real eye opener.
B:	Well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too, and I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I think they really it really penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it. Because it's something you weren't forced to do
M:	Yeah.
B:	so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.
M:	Right.
B:	And you're more receptive.
M:	Uh, I've been to, uh, several parties. Uh, I was at the, the, uh party here a couple of weeks ago and it was held at a, uh at a golf course.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	We, we've done that once or twice.
B:	Oh, that's exciting.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But I loved it.
B:	Uh-huh. Well, I had a friend that, uh, visited England not, well, I think it's been probably two years now, but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to England, because she really has a great desire to do that, because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I'd like to go to Ireland, or, uh-hope,
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I thought that was really neat, and I thought, well, I'm not going to have to worry about, you're just going to be walking around and talking to people, and not have to be an authority figure, you just have to have a walking partner.
B:	Do your own thing. Yeah.
M:	!!!!,!!etwork!!
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you know, they had, they, they would, they'd have a sign that said this is for the benefit of the people, you can't do this, this is just for the pleasure of the company
B:	That's wonderful. There's a lot out there to see,
M:	Yeah.
B:	I'll say .
M:	and, uh, I don't know, I guess I'd have to say that, I'm not, I think it's a good question to ask, you know, what, what sort of, uh
B:	Well, I lived across the street almost from Canada
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that was, that, that's a nice place. Canada is very nice.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I'm sure that that would make a nice camper.
B:	Oh, yes, absolutely. Sure, somebody that knows their way around.
M:	Yes.
B:	Well, you've been quite a few places there
M:	Yeah, I've been to England, Germany and England and Ireland,
B:	Once you think about it, huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I, I think, uh-hope, I'm going to have to go to Europe one of these times.
B:	Oh, that's great.
M:	And it was just, it was, it, you know, it really was, you couldn't, you could't,  you couldn trieve like that.
B:	Uh-huh. That's great.
M:	So, it's, it, it really is.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	So, we, we were pretty lucky. We were on a cruise. We got on the ship with all our kids, and so we got to, we went to a small town called Barry Saint Edmunds and we had a dinner party and, and all the kids sat at our table and, you know, we had like a total of eleven people.
B:	What did you wind up with?
M:	Oh, we wound up with, uh, uh a, a, uh
B:	Oh, okay
M:	I just, I didn't want to have to mess with that.
B:	Uh, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, that was quite a, a challenge.
B:	They kind of guided you.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, we've only been here a couple of months and, uh
B:	Well, good.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	Yeah. I guess that's what retirement is all about.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I understand that. Well, it was nice talking with you too, Craig.
M:	Okay, good talking to you. Bye.
B:	You do the same.
M:	Thanks, bye-bye.
B:	Thank you.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Bye-bye.
