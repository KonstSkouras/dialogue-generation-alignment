B:	Yes.
M:	Uh, and it's, it's not just that they don't, they don tinker with it, they just try to, to inject more, more, uh, the same, the exact same, uh the exact, uh...
B:	Yes, it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes.
M:	and, you, you get these people that are waiting on death row, and you know they, they are, they're almost two and a half years old,
B:	That happens on occasion, it sure does, maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.
M:	Uh, well, I think that's, that's probably true.
B:	You know, I don't know, or a person personally.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I think I would be, you know, I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty, I don't know that it's a big deterrent really. I don't know that it is. I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, yeah, it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's sad. I mean, I, I do feel sorry for people who are, you, you do realize that the average person doesn't go out and, and do something like that,
B:	Yes.
M:	and, um.
B:	Yes it is. It's a tough, tough question. It really is. I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that. Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, absolutely. that's right.
M:	I mean, they're, they, they can kill somebody pretty easily, but they're not going to, you can't, you don't know, they don't have the mental capacity to kill a person.
B:	Not with me personally. It is with a lot of other people.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	It's not, not to me personally, no.
M:	Yeah.
B:	No.
M:	So,
B:	Uh-huh. Yes. That's a, it's a tough, tough question, it really is.
M:	Yeah, it is. I think, I think it's important to have the support.
B:	Yes, I think most states do have capital punishment. Yes. But, I think the U S is one of the few countries that still do.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yes, they're only, I was reading something about it the other day, I think there was only like six or eight countries in the world, that have capital punishment still.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	A lot of them had to have elected not to do so. Now I don't know, what they do in place of it. You know, maybe it's life in prisonment or, you know, something, I I don't know how they handle it I was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yes. Yes, a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yes.
M:	I mean, it's, it, it may not be the best system but it's the best one that exists.
B:	Uh-huh. Yes.
M:	But, uh, I don't know, I think that, I'm not a lawyer by any means, but I think, I would think that it's a very important aspect of a civil case.
B:	Right, the first appeal is automatic, so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat.
M:	Yeah, right.
B:	There's, there's a lot of, you know, last minute, uh, things that happen cause a person not to, have to go through the whole thing.
M:	Uh-uh.
B:	Yes, uh-huh. That's, that's fairly recent, I don't know, how recent, but fairly recent, in the state of Texas. Before that, it was, uh, death by electrocution.
M:	!!!!,!!Oh!!
B:	Yes, it certainly does.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yes, it would almost have to be, I suppose. If you, if you had to chose, I guess I would, I am sure I would take the lethal injection.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yes, absolutely.
M:	Uh, I don't know, I just, I'm, I've always felt that, uh, uh you know, if, if they would have, uh...
B:	It's a, it's a tough question. It really is. I guess, if I had to say yes or no, I would say, you know, yes. I, I would have to lean toward capital punishment, you know, for certain crimes.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	Right.
B:	I think, we hope that it will be, you know, some sort of deterrent or, you know, an eye for an eye type thing, or something like that.
M:	Right.
B:	Some of the crimes are just so brutal and so, you know, useless. This may seem to be the best way out. I don't know.
M:	Yeah, I, I agree with you.
B:	Easiest way out maybe. No, I don't think it's a monetary thing.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yes, especially the murder rate, its just gone crazy. Yes.
M:	Yeah, I mean, I, I know that. I mean I, it's, I'm, I guess I'm in a, in a real strange mood right now. I'm trying to think of what else we can talk about.
B:	Absolutely. Yes, I wish I had the answer for that, everybody does.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yes, it's nothing to be proud of, certainly not.
M:	I, I, I'm sure it's not. I think it's a shame that, uh, you have to have a degree in, uh in, selection of jury, jury selection and that you have a, a very narrow view of, of the jury selection.
B:	Yes. Yes, so have we been very, very fortunate.
M:	Yeah, it, it was a very difficult choice.
B:	That's right. Absolutely.
M:	Uh, and I don't know how you combat that, uh, you, I mean you, you must have a certain frame of thought on it, but I think that, that, you have to have some frame of reason to believe that somebody else is worse.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I think that's what we all have to face.
B:	Absolutely.
M:	So, I, I think that, that, um.
B:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	You know, and I think that's one of the things that's so sad.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, I think, I don't know, I, I do, I'm not sure I would, I mean, I would like to know that my children, you know, would be okay with it. But, uh.
B:	So would I, I fortunately, I have never been in that circumstance, I hope I never am, like, like everybody else.
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, um I'm not sure what they do with it. I mean, you can appeal and they can appeal again.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, um.
B:	Right.
M:	So,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's just not that people are choosing the jury or that people aren't selected.
B:	Sure, it's, it's a big responsibility, it really is.
M:	It really is, and, uh, you know, and I know, I'm, I work in the legal department and, and we have to hire lawyers,
B:	Yes. So would I.
M:	I think, uh, you know, I think it's probably the right thing to do. I think, I'm not sure, though, that, that the jury system works that way.
B:	Yes. Absolutely.
M:	But I think that, you know, it, it would be something that you would look into, you would be able to do, you'd be able, you could be able able to make friends with these people,
B:	It is, it's a tough subject, it really is.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Right. That's right.
M:	Uh, we're, we've, we have to make ourselves a pact with the people that we find the most ways to help them.
B:	Well, thank you, it's nice talking to you.
M:	You too.
B:	Uh-huh. Bye-bye.
