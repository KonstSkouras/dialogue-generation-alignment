B:	Yeah, I, I, New York does not
M:	No, I think you have to pay for that in New York state.
B:	but, uh, they're, they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that, uh, the Democrat that he is,  and Mario Cuomo
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.
M:	Yeah, well, that's good, I mean, they, they've got a lot of power.
B:	I'd, I would agree, with that even more, I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but I'm really offended,  by the thought that I have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.
M:	Uh, Right.
B:	Right.
M:	and they're being, they, they are being, uh
B:	I, I don't know,
M:	I mean, I, I think it's a social disease that people have.
B:	it's a hard question, you look at the United States, we have the largest murder rate of any developed, uh,
M:	Yeah.
B:	or, uh,
M:	Right. And it's not just the number of people that are killed, but also the number that are in prison.
B:	Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh
M:	Yeah.
B:	it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, in this state.
M:	Yeah, I, I think that's, that is a good thing. I, uh.
B:	Now, the, the, and that's with, uh, you have to have, uh, oh, a police investigation, you have to,  have references,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh,
M:	Oh, that would be neat.
B:	and I know it, there is, it's very easy to get, uh, uh, you know, there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that,  which aren't the, I, I don't consider to be the kind of crime, uh,  weapon, you know,
M:	Right. Right.
B:	uh, so,
M:	yeah, and, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	and they were, you, you'd be the kid that got beat up by the guy, you were the kid who got beat to death.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah, yeah,
M:	and you know it's, it's a big deal that way, you don't know,
B:	well, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and then
M:	I think it was, it was a, uh, a, the, the guy that held him out of the jail, uh-huh, was, uh.
B:	yeah
M:	Yeah.
B:	and did it again and, uh,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	No.
M:	but he was the only,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and he was, he was sentenced to death, and, and the, the sentence was given, uh-hundred years, but they changed it to, uh.
B:	Oh, God.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Great.
M:	And, and then they put her in a rest home.
B:	Surely,  there's and end to, the situation.
M:	It seems that,  that there's a lot of anger,  because people say, you, you're welcome to go.
B:	Right.
M:	and, and, uh and I think that's, that's the way that the justice system works and I, I think it's going to be addressed in the courts, but it's not going to change over the next ten or fifteen years, you, you're going to have to change that aspect of it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I don tinker with that at all.
B:	Right.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Rome, New York, it's up state it it's, uh, near Syracuse
M:	!!!!,!!iful!! My little boy just got in kindergarten, and I was just thinking, you know, that's great, that they're starting kindergarten next year.
B:	it's about, uh, well, I, I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach, I work in Rome, uh,
M:	Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
B:	It's more rural,
M:	I'm in, I'm in Plano, so.
B:	uh, it use to be use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	but it's kind of, uh, all the industry has gone south,
M:	Right.
B:	and, uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area and, uh, uh,  so it's,   Not too bad,
M:	Yeah.
B:	it, you know, you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,  uh, small city type problems,
M:	Yeah.
B:	but I don't know that there's a real, uh,
M:	Yeah.
B:	no there isn't the harsh crime and all.
M:	Oh, I agree. Uh,
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	they, they go out and kill the person, you can't do that,
B:	Right.
M:	and it's like, you just don't, you don't see, you can't see what they're doing.
B:	I think, I think Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because I'm from, uh,  from Pennsylvania also, just, uh, just outside,  of Philadelphia,
M:	Uh-uh. Oh, uh-h.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, I mean, I've been there like, I was in, like, the second grade, and then I went to college,
B:	Right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	The west part of the state is and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so.
M:	Oh, that's, that is a, that would be a really scary thought.
B:	Right.
M:	I, I guess I have a hard time with that.
B:	Right.
M:	and it's not that we have to be a little bit Romanesque about it,
B:	Sure.
M:	if they had a chance to do something, they would say that they were very, very creative and,
B:	Yeah,
M:	but it's not like it's going to happen to everybody.
B:	if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them I think everyone would, I, they'd,  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face,  as they did it.
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-hue. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think,  I think that would be the best thing to do.
B:	Yeah. Right.
M:	and, uh  that was a big factor in my decision.
B:	Right. Right.
M:	but you would want to know, you wouldn tinker with it. I mean, I think that's the whole point of the trial by jury.
B:	Well, uh, I, uh, yeah, I don't know I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because I guess it's a pretty,  pretty rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Oh, yeah, an injection,
M:	Yeah.
B:	yeah, that would be even, yeah, I didn't even, think about that.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I think,
M:	but I think, I think in the, in, in Texas they have it.
B:	yeah, there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like, uh, Massachusetts went back,  and reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but, uh, it's on the books.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	Right.
