B:	It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time. And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.
M:	Uh, I see.
B:	Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,
M:	Uh.
B:	and we've had it for a while, but all of a sudden it just wasn't working, and it looks like there's a part missing from it. My husband opened it up and whatever, and of course we don't have the receipt any more, so we can't take it back
M:	Oh.
B:	Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long
M:	Yeah.
B:	uh,
M:	I think, uh, the quality of the, uh the crafts, you know, as far as, uh crafts and so forth, uh...
B:	Yeah.
M:	and it's, it's really a pain.
B:	Well, that's true, and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,
M:	Well you can't always get it fixed.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Well, yeah, I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,
M:	Uh, well, I don't know if you've heard about the, the, uh, the Sears, uh Sears, the one that, uh, that just opened up here a few months ago.
B:	I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah, I, I agree with you there.
B:	you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time, and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,
M:	That's right.
B:	I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.
M:	Right, right.
B:	We never could get it declared a lemon, and the car would go and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I, there was just, you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything, and they got it finally semifixed, but it was such a hassle
M:	Yeah.
B:	yeah, yeah it, it really is, uh, but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.
M:	Well, it's funny because I've talked to people who have had dogs and they say that they have the greatest reactions.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they're not going to, they're saying well, you can't have, you're not allowed to have it anymore, and I thought, you, you got to get it, and you're supposed to, you have to make this deal, so, you didn't, you don't want to make a deal, you want to get rid of it.
B:	Well, I think that's true, and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and, and he'll, uh you know he'll fix it right away, but it's just not something that you want to do.
B:	I think technology is better, I'm, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that
B:	I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!!clamation!!ety!!
B:	I, I, everything is so automated, uh, and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Well, yeah, that's that's true.
M:	I think, I mean, it's, it, it would be nice to have a, a little bit of variety, you don't have to, have everything in one place.
B:	Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.
