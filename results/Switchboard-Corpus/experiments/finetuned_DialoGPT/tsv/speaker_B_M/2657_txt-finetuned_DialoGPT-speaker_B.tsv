B:	Okay. Go ahead.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Do you have any children?
B:	Yeah
M:	and, and, and you know, that's, that, I, I don't really know, I think, I mean, I do, I really do. I think that there's, there's a lot of things that, uh, that I think we should do to, to help people out.
B:	That's true.
M:	And, uh  I think that we've, we've learned a great deal from it.
B:	Um, me either. I, I went to college and then started working and then got married and,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, I haven't, I know that, uh, my sister, I have a twin sister and when they graduated she went to, uh, teach in a small town down in south Texas and I know, that like if you have college notes, if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your, you know, your college note or whatever.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. If it's like, you know, really a, you know, a lower paying job, you know, where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to, you know, to live.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, she only taught there one year but I,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, she got some money from the school, but I think she only had a portion of it.
B:	And, um, I think it would be, I know that also one of my cousins who, uh, he is in like the therapy type thing and he was, um, some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at, uh, uh, I mean, it's a nursing home or something like that.
M:	Uh, uh-homing
B:	So, you know, if, I think that's a good way for people to, you know, maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	Yeah. As far as yeah, getting doctors and all that stuff, yeah.
M:	Well, it, it depends on the doctor. I mean if you want to go into a profession, you have to be willing to go out and, uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But it's not a, you're right, it's a major medical problem, but it's something that needs to be addressed, and, uh, and it's going to be a big, uh,
B:	Yeah.
M:	But,
B:	I really don't know that much about it, you know, I, I, I think of the Peace Corps, you know, more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when,
M:	!!!%!!clamation point!! Remind me of that. I used to do that quite a bit when I was in the Peace corps, you're right.
B:	Yeah. And don't they go into other countries and stuff?
M:	!!!!,!!clamation!! There!!
B:	Uh-huh. Things that make the, yeah. Make them more self-supporting?
M:	Yeah, yeah, make them self-starters.
B:	Yeah.
M:	they, they, they have a very, uh
B:	Right. Yeah.
M:	And, uh, you know, I think, uh.
B:	But it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it.
M:	Yeah. That's true. That, that's true, that, that really is true.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, um, I know, um.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think that would be a really good thing to do.
B:	I don't, I don't know that you could require everyone to, do that for, yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, was, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,
M:	Yeah, well, that's true.
B:	Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, you just don't want to go into that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And that's the way they're going to do it.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and that's, that's one of the problems.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, they, uh they're very, very, uh...
B:	Right, yeah.
M:	But they're in the process of being,
B:	Yeah, uh-huh.
M:	They're, uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	And I mean, I, I'm, I guess I'm kind of old-fashioned too. I think that, uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know, I don, I'm, I guess I'm cynical of the whole thing, but I don think there could be a more permanent solution to it.
B:	Well, Down here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that I think probably need help and, could be helped.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, I mean, I think that's, I don't know, that's a, that, that is a, a problem with the United States. I think it's a big problem. I don t understand why the United Nations, uh, why they don't have more input into it. I mean I, it's like, you know, why not, why, why we don't want some assistance.
B:	And maybe rather than just, require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like, um, during college, you know, maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work, and help people in that area or people in the United States.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	There probably are, you know, for but I'm sure, that's probably like people that do that are, are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but I think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something, you know, and realize it's everybody's responsibility to, um, help these people, you know, and I'm not saying just give them money but, I mean, because they have to be taught to be,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah I mean, I know that's what my father-in-law was talking about, you know, when you give these people money or, what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give, um, more money to these people, I mean, and that's not really the answer, I mean , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend, it on, you know, booze or something like that,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	but.
M:	That, that, that is the whole thing. I, I don't know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	you know, what if you gave them money to clean out their closets and tell them they need some lube?
B:	Or, you know, to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves,
M:	Right.
B:	I mean, I guess we're getting kind of off the subject, here, but.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I mean it's, True. Yeah.
M:	It's not like they're going to, you can't,
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I don, I know that there are a lot of other organizations that could do it.
B:	Flower Mound, yeah. So, we're a little you know, farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing.
M:	Right.
