B:	So, social changes aren't that much for me either.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Well, yeah, that.
M:	and, uh,
B:	I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh, relaxed and laid back and stuff
M:	Yeah.
B:	and.
M:	Yeah, I've seen a lot of change, I think.
B:	I think so.
M:	Yeah, I think that's, uh,
B:	I think so, and a lot, I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!ets!!
B:	Yeah, I think so. I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.
M:	Right. Right, I agree with you.
B:	I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.
M:	Right.
B:	No, huh-uh.
M:	And, and I think that that's probably going to happen.
B:	Right. Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-hue.
B:	and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know
M:	Uh.
B:	but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.
M:	Right.
B:	It wasn't that long that I was that young.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I've got a ten year old, and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms, and and he knows about AIDS,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, it's hard to know what we're doing because I don't know what's going to happen.
B:	No, I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part. I mean that's, sex is rampant,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and it always will be, and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
B:	I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,
M:	Uh-hues.
B:	but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,
M:	Right.
B:	and, and they sit down and they look at you right in the face and they expect a truthful answer.
M:	Right.
B:	You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.
M:	Right.
B:	They, they, that just does not go.
M:	I think, I think they are, I, I don't know.
B:	And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	But it, it's interesting, listening to them. I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation.
M:	Uh, I do too.
B:	Yeah, I do too.
M:	I mean, I don tinker around with things, but I'm, I'm more than likely to, you're more than I thought you would be.
B:	I know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
