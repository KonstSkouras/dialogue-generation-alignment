M:	I don't know.
B:	Yeah, you can't enjoy it. Right.
M:	And I like to have them cook for me.
B:	That's, that's what, I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven,
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	it's,
M:	That, that would be great.
B:	everybody just says how wonderful it is, and it's it's like, uh, yes,
M:	It's not as good as it could be.
B:	I.
M:	That's, that's, uh.
B:	That's one of those things I got famous for in college. People would come and say could would you come over and make lasagna for me
M:	Uh.
B:	It's like, well, I can't really give you a recipe, uh
M:	Yeah, but I've heard, I've talked to people who have done it and it's really, it's a lot of work,
B:	I can I can just do it
M:	Yeah.
B:	I like doing that kind of stuff.
M:	Yeah, so you'd be surprised at how much, how much you do.
B:	And it's, it's fun, in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	We just had a bunch of people over and we had, we did lasagna and garlic bread and, uh, yummy.
M:	Oh.
B:	Uh, I do too, in fact
M:	Uh.
B:	Oh. Oh, good.
M:	And, uh
B:	Uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.
M:	!!!you're my favorite
B:	And have, you know, like three or four couples come over, and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff.
M:	Uh, uh,
B:	But it's, it's inexpensive
M:	Yeah.
B:	plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it, and you got a great dinner.
M:	Oh, that sounds great.
B:	It's, it's real easy, I like doing that part.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it's,
M:	Yeah, I, I've seen some of those, too.
B:	we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids.
M:	Uh, oh, yeah, that's true.
B:	And that, it's, it's fine, because then I can just say, Okay fine, you bring this, you bring this, you bring this, we're done.
M:	Right.
B:	And it's pretty cool.
M:	It's a lot of fun.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh.
M:	!!!%!! translated Well, that sounds good.
B:	Oh.
M:	And, uh, that way you don't have to make a lot of mess.
B:	Oh, I love it
M:	Uh-uh.
B:	Um.
M:	and you, and you cover it with, uh, you know, angel food cake and put in raspberry, uh-huh.
B:	Over the uncooked rice?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh.
M:	yeah,
B:	Oh, how neat.
M:	And, uh, then you can also make it ahead of time and you can put it on the next plate and then just cover it.
B:	Huh. Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes and I'll put in there, and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person but I like it, it adds something to the chicken.
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	And then just bake it, and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice.
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	Yeah
M:	I just put that in my thinking for when we do that again.
B:	It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um, yeah
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
M:	Yeah, I've tried to do that. I don't know if I could do it anymore.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	But, um.
B:	But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice.
M:	Uh, well, I'm not sure how you would, uh, cook it, I mean, I would just make it like a rice dish, you take the rice out of a rice cooker, you put the rice in the, uh you know, with the melted butter, and then you cook it on high for about thirty minutes.
B:	So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
M:	it's a, it's a rice dish with, um, put in like a little bit of chopped up, um.
B:	Um.
M:	it was like, uh, three quarter cup of water.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um, I, I don't know. I guess I'm not really into the whole, uh, metric system as much as I'd like to.
B:	Yeah, yeah, I, I use that for for rice and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor.
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	Um. Now that would be good.
M:	Uh-uh. I have a recipe for that.
B:	How long do you have to bake it?
M:	Uh, it's not, it doesn't, it, it takes a long time.
B:	I do, I do microwave too, a lot
M:	Yeah.
B:	How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave?
M:	I don't know.
B:	Oh, okay. Okay. Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	or do you go ahead and let it cook through?
M:	Uh, you can either use chicken or, uh, you know, a baked potato.
B:	Um. Ooh, this is a beneficial call. I like this
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, but that one's an easy one. It's like, just put in, a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it.
M:	Uh, yeah, that's true.
B:	But it, it makes a great, I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it.
M:	Uh, well, that's good.
B:	And, because my daughter calls it her gravy and I mean, she thinks it's wonderful, my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to,
