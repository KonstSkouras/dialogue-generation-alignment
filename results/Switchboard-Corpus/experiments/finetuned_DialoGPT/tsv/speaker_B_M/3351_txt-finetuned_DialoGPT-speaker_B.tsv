B:	Tibby and Liberty.
M:	Tobias, Liberty. They're about the only type of pet I've had that I would want to have a pet by a couple of people.
B:	Tibby is the dog and Liberty is the cat.
M:	And what's the, uh, what's their name?
B:	Oh.
M:	And, uh, we just have a regular old two door.
B:	Oh Ours are pretty calm.
M:	Yeah, ours is.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, they're, they are, uh they're not house pets, but they are really sweet dogs.
B:	Yeah. Our cat we got from the pound the day the night she was going to be put to sleep. So that's why we call her Liberty.
M:	Uh, I'm sure that, uh, the, the cats in the litter box are different from the ones that we have.
B:	Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?
M:	Yeah
B:	I've had a skunk
M:	Oh.
B:	I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice
M:	Oh, well.
B:	uh, let's see, I've had gerbils, I have, I had a son, he's now gone from the home, that was an animal lover.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Yes
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	it was litter trained
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	and we had it perfumed
M:	!!!%!! translated We, we had a German shorthair.
B:	and, uh, it was very aggressive.
M:	Uh, that's interesting.
B:	But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of his territory being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Nobody came near it when he was there.
M:	Yeah, that's, that, that is a big problem.
B:	Oh.
M:	and the skunks got scared and he bit him.
B:	Yeah, they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them, but the glands had been removed
M:	Oh, no.
B:	so,
M:	Well, that's a good thing, though.
B:	Right.
M:	So,
B:	Yeah, I always said if I Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	That'd be the best way to be.
M:	I think so, too.
B:	Well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia
M:	Oh, that's terrible.
B:	and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went.
M:	Uh, uh-hauhuh, uh, uh.
B:	So, when he died, we got a little one.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was almost cruel because,
M:	Well, that's, that is sad.
B:	Yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.
M:	Oh, gosh.
B:	So we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened, it would be easier to carry.
M:	Uh, I know, I don't know, you, you don't think about the things that go on around you, I think, I, I'm not going to have to worry about that.
B:	And then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico now.
M:	Oh, yeah, that's a cat too.
B:	Do you?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Um.
M:	and we used, you know, we had used, uh we had a, uh a cat, um cat, mix,
B:	Yeah, well, don't even talk to me, I, when I was single I had gone away for the weekend,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and my husband, then fianc3e, was to keep my cat, and he let her out, and my house was loaded with fleas, I mean, you walked in and your legs were just black.
M:	Oh.
B:	And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Yeah, I found it, you know, in the street.
M:	Huh.
B:	I was a social worker at the time, and found it,
