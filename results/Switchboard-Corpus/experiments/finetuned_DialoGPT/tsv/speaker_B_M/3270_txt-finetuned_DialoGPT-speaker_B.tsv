B:	Um,
M:	And, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Oh, which state is that?
M:	That's Alaska.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, so I, I was real disappointed in it. I thought it was a really good movie, but I thought they were trying too hard to go all the way.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Right. Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yep. Right.
M:	Uh, I mean, it's, it was a little, uh little over a hundred dollars over two years.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but it's just a, it's not a very good idea.
B:	Yeah. Definitely I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place.
M:	Yeah, and I don't know, I, I don tinker with it too much, but I, uh I, it's, it seems to me that there is a, a tremendous amount of waste.
B:	I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was.
M:	Right.
B:	And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right.
M:	So, I don't know, it's, it seems to me that, that, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, I'm not really sure that, uh.
B:	Well, that's right. Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste
M:	Uh,
B:	but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem.
M:	I don't know what, what, uh.
B:	I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but I don think it's really been a great help at all.
B:	Right. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	I think that, um.
B:	Okay All right. You too.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.!!!!!That's a song by Kenny G.
B:	Bye-bye.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
