B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, I, I thought well, I'll try that.
B:	Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.
M:	Well, it was.
B:	Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?
M:	Well E P a has been doing a lot of, uh you know, a lot more research, and, uh and they have, they have really, really, uh...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, the E S P A was the one that said that they should have been more involved with the war.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh they were saying that, uh the waste is not being recycled. It's being burned.
B:	Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.
M:	Yeah, I've, I'm not a real big fan of the newspaper either.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they're trying to start putting the recycling in the, in the bins out front and, and the like.
B:	Right.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Well, that's good.
M:	So,
B:	Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.
M:	Uh, they have those in the, uh  in the parks.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, he went in and, and he got the engineering major and he proved that, that he could do it by just using the engineering degree.
B:	Oh really.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that
B:	Right.
M:	but, uh
B:	Huh.
M:	So, I, I think that's the major, uh, change is that, uh.
B:	Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?
M:	Uh, yeah. Well, I don't know how they would, how they'd do it with gasoline. I guess they'd have to burn it
B:	Oh.
M:	And, and he didn tinker with it. He, he tinker, but, but he didn, you know, it, it was, it got, it wasn't, it didn't get anywhere near what he was trying to do.
B:	Okay
M:	Well, what do you think of, uh, the space shuttle landing?
B:	No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.
M:	Yeah, I bet it was.
B:	Did it change anything for you?
M:	No, not really, because I've had it for, you know, I've been in this for, I guess about three years now.
