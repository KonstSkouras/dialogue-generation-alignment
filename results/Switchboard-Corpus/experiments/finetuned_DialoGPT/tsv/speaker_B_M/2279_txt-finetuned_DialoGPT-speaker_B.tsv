M:	Well I, I, uh I, um, work as a temporary in a temporary agency.
B:	Um. Okay, and did,
M:	so,
B:	Yeah.
M:	so.
B:	What, what are you doing?
M:	I'm, uh, I'm doing an internship at North Texas State University
B:	Oh, okay. Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball?
M:	Well, she's not really into sports, but, uh.
B:	Okay, and, and in, in his league do they have like a pitcher, or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what?
M:	!!!%!!;!! LINE!!action!!atic!! Controlling!!ets!!condition!! Reminders!!
B:	Okay.
M:	And then they have to, they have, uh they have an auction going on and, uh and, they, uh have, they do a lot of training camp and things like that.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Yeah. I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	so.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Yeah, and how about, how about like on the weekends. Do you do sports or do you go out?
M:	Well, I go out, uh, every once in a while, uh
B:	Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off?
M:	Yeah.
B:	In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now?
M:	Yeah.
B:	And where do you go?
M:	We go to the, um, University of New Hampshire.
B:	Have, have you been out of the country?
M:	Yeah. We've been out, uh, I went to Germany for a couple of years.
B:	Oh, okay, well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave, I mean  I, I lived in places, like
M:	Oh.
B:	when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial, and then when I went back to visit, I went to the Washington Memorial.
M:	Uh, uh-hoh.
B:	Right.
M:	and they have their own little club, and they go and, uh.
B:	Right. Well, it's, it's a beautiful city.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and that was the most boring place on earth.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah. Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland?
M:	Yes.
B:	Oh, okay. So, but um, now, I don't know, but um, but let's see, when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, then after that, I, my sister lives in Turkey, so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And this Christmas, I went to Turkey. But basically, it's a, for the past couple of years, I, since my parents are, are, well, I'm from Argentina, and my parents live down there. So, all the traveling I do is alone.
M:	!!!!,!!Oh!!
B:	And, uh, we were never much of, uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something.
M:	Um.
B:	That was, uh, that was a lot of fun.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, so there's never much of a family family thing. You know, one of those hell family vacations.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and, and, and we try to go over there and we go over to Grand Canyon and we do that.
B:	Yeah.
M:	so we were really in kind of a rough spot, you couldn't really make a living at it.
B:	Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, so he could buy us material things.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, but I still feel, you know, it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something
M:	Right.
B:	and the way I was brought up, and he wants me now, he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now
M:	Uh.
B:	and it's very hard for me because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, and it's always the same man
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, and he wants to be best friends
M:	Uh.
B:	but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. It's like, you know, I love you and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know
M:	Uh, that's true.
B:	and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together, and you know, his kids are, you know, when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach, and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, uh, I was brought up the same way, it doesn't matter what age you have, just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up you know,
M:	Right.
B:	but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	he's got to have a place to store all that stuff, and, you know.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, you just have to trust their judgment.
B:	Yeah, yeah, but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, what I'll do is, you know, like, I mean, you might have problems, but it's not your kids' problems you know,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and you got to try to be with them as much as you can and to, you know, like, thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know,
M:	Right.
B:	and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know,
M:	Right.
B:	first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know, and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.
M:	Uh-hums, uh, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and we were, you were just sort of like, well, we'll just wait and see what happens, you, you're not going to have any kids in college.
B:	Yeah, my, my father was raising four oh well, three kids before he had me, so it was, uh, you know, you're trying, to support, uh, four kids, and it's pretty hard you know,
M:	Yeah
B:	and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.
M:	That's right.
B:	He says yeah, but then I wouldn't have you, I go, yeah, but then you would have a lot of money
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and I'm sure that that's not going to help either.
B:	But, you know, like, four, I mean four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition. I'm paying, you know, three thousand, no, what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college, but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, it's like, what does it, what does it cost. It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose. Now they go to a state college and they live at home you know,
M:	Right.
B:	and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like
M:	Uh.
B:	I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know.
M:	Right.
B:	Oh, oh, excuse me?
M:	What's your interest?
B:	Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering.
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah, and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
M:	Yeah.
B:	because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina.
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	Well, my dad wants me to go back. So.
M:	Uh, I don't know. I, I, uh, I've always considered going to Japan.
B:	No.
M:	No, no, no.
B:	No, because if you go back there, then you can never get out.
M:	Huh-uh.
B:	Like you don't have any money to, to, get out.
M:	Yeah, and I, I was wondering if you had, if you were to buy a car or,
B:	So, uh, and, uh, I was thinking, you know, like, Oh my God, you know, I go back there, and then, and I get married there, and now I have kids there, and then I'll never leave the place, you know.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I know, and that's, that's what happened to my brother. He came to school up here, and then when he went down there, he was just so bad off, you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So.
M:	Well, that, that is, that would be a really tough, tough situation.
B:	Yeah, I've been calling a lot of companies. There, some of them are interested. Well, at least for a year and a half I can work,
M:	Uh-hums.
B:	so.
M:	I'm not sure, I'm not too sure what the laws are pertaining to this.
B:	All right, same here.
M:	Bye-bye.
B:	Bye-bye.
