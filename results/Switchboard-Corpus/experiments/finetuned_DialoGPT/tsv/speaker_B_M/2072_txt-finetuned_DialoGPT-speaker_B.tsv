B:	How about yourself?
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! That's a good one.
B:	Really?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, yeah, that's neat.
M:	I really enjoy it, I just haven't done a whole lot of it.
B:	Oh, that's great, uh-huh.
M:	and so I, I don't know, I'm, I like to take a little time and, and look at the different areas and try to find what's really worth it.
B:	Oh, that sounds nice. I like bluegrass, too.
M:	Yeah, I like it, I do, too, but I just don't like the, I don't know, I, I think it's too commercialized.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I, I don't like to do it, so I don 'use' it.
B:	That's the hard part, right?
M:	Yeah.
B:	If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, that's good, too.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so,
B:	Oh, it's good and it's healthy, too.
M:	Uh, yeah, I guess, uh.
B:	We do that too, we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind of stuff, we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week, you know.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, I, I guess that's about all I can do, I'm trying to think of what else I watch.
B:	And we like movies, that yeah.
M:	What kind of movies have you seen lately?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Sure.
M:	So, uh.
B:	Oh yeah, that's great, too. Uh-huh. Yeah, we did some remodeling when we bought a house, we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering, that's fun.
M:	Uh-oh, that sounds like fun. Yeah.
B:	It is. It really is.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.!! remind me!!And, uh, I have a lot of friends that have, have done, uh
B:	Yeah, exactly. I like things that, you know, two people can do, but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know, kind of gives you some space for yourself, and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create, and I like to crochet and knit. I made some afghans and that kind of stuff. I like doing things with my hands.
M:	Uh-hoh, that sounds like you must really like to do stuff with them.
B:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.!! Auto!!clamation!!;!! translated!! =!!?!!You!!Have!! wished!! Wild!!
B:	Yes, I love to cook.
M:	Oh, that's great.

M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yeah, pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff.
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I like to, uh, cook and I like, uh Mexican food,
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, it is.
M:	I mean, I just don't think it's healthy, you know.
B:	Do you do barbecues?
M:	Uh, well, actually, I'm a, I work in a restaurant.
B:	Well, uh, uh, smoking and all that stuff?
M:	Yeah, we, uh
B:	Yeah, yep,
M:	Yeah.
B:	I, I lived in Abilene for a little while, and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue, and, uh, oh, that was great.
M:	Oh.
B:	Really great,
M:	I really miss that.
B:	they have some nice stuff down there. I miss it
M:	Oh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	We did, I did horseback riding, too, in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses and, uh, that was kind of for them, but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, so, uh, that was a real, I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, we always had horses around, and I really enjoyed that,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I was disappointed when I went to Texas. I didn't see that many of them.
M:	Yeah, I, I think it's a shame too, because you know you have to get a lot more people interested in that kind of thing, you don't have a whole bunch of them in the whole time.
B:	Yes
M:	Oh.
B:	I know, I know, it's true.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
