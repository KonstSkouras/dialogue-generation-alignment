M:	and, uh, I, I don't know, I just, I do believe in funding AIDS research and I think it's really a shame that we don't have the support that we have.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they have AIDS research and, and they are saying that they have a real problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh they had a, a very, uh...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, they had to come in and they had this machine that does it for them.
B:	Huh.
M:	But I don't think they're really telling us enough.
B:	Yeah. I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, well it is very frightening and scary. I have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases, and, uh, I mean whether,
M:	Well, you don't have any of the other diseases that we do.
B:	Yes.
M:	or, or, or what it really means is that, uh.
B:	And, uh, whether those diseases can some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	uh
M:	And that's, that's a, that was a big leap for me. I didn't know that diseases were that deadly.
B:	didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then part of it's lack of education. I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be most effectively spent.
M:	Uh, well, I think it's, it's more of a, a social disease than a, you see in some of the older sixties or seventies, you would think.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh
B:	And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two things. One is preventing the spread and the other is for, uh, for, uh, treating the illness.
M:	Right.
B:	And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't have any opinion.
M:	I think, I think the, the, uh the, you know, the medical care, the quality of doctors is questionable.
B:	But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh, teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, well, you know,
M:	And I don, I don'e, I think that's right.
B:	t-, whether my dentist or
M:	That, that, that would be true.
B:	and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about mosquitoes. And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not. Can't get it from mosquitoes. And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions, yes.
M:	Yeah, I think that's, you can get it.
B:	And I don't know that's true or not. I mean, I just heard it in passing, but so what does that,
M:	Uh, I donno, I haven't heard that.
B:	what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
M:	Right, and I don, I don t remember if that's in Texas or not, but in Oklahoma, it's a no smoking, no smoking area.
B:	Yeah.
M:	How do you feel about it?
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they're not going to tell you anything that you didn't know about.
B:	No.
M:	And, uh, I mean, I don't, I, I'm not saying that it's right, but it's, it's certainly not what it should be.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I,
B:	Oh.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
M:	Yeah. I think that, uh, we need to do something about all the drug related, uh  activities that we're involved in.
B:	I, I, give me cyanide. I mean, is it )),
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! LINE!!clamation!!ety!! You!!You!!That!! That!!
B:	Ri-, Exactly.
M:	And, uh, but, uh.
B:	And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, if these people knowingly consent to be, research monkeys and well, let them,
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
B:	let them, do it.
M:	That's right.
