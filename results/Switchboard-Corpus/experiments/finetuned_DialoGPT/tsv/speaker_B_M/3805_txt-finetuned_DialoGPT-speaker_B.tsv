B:	Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you? Uh, this, I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady, but this, I heard this on a Christian program and it was, uh, about the N E A and, that's the National Endowment for Arts, and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And then it just frosts me terribly.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Absolutely.
M:	and that, that, uh
B:	I believe that's true, yes.
M:	And I think that, uh...
B:	That's correct.
M:	You know, and I think that's going to lead to a lot of problems.
B:	Heavy involvement from the public.
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, heavy involvement from the public.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Absolutely.
M:	And, uh.
B:	No, it is not. It's lopsided, very much so.
M:	And I think that, uh.
B:	Uh-huh, that's right, they pull the strings.
M:	Right.
B:	Right, the, yeah
M:	and they can be used to, you know, to great effect.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh  and it will, uh
B:	I'm sure they will.
M:	Yeah, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But it's, it's hard to imagine that, uh, one person controlling all of this would have any affect at all.
B:	Yes, I understand that, but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it.
M:	Well, I don tinker around with it too much.
B:	Oh, absolutely.
M:	And, uh, I'm not sure that we're, we're going to, uh.
B:	Right, absolutely.
M:	But I think that the, the media, you hear so much, you get so fed up with it that you want to turn it off.
B:	We only see the tip of the iceberg only.
M:	That's right.
B:	You know, there's so much of it going on that it would really, you know, uh, set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture.
M:	Yeah, it's true.
