B:	We were there for ten days.
M:	!!!%
B:	Yeah, yes. So where have you been?
M:	I've been to Kauai.
B:	Morocco. Really.
M:	yeah, it's, it was a very, very, uh, wealthy country, but it's very different from what I'd seen before.
B:	No kidding. what, what, did you just decide to go there or,
M:	Well, I, I went to Mexico City, and then I was able to get a job there.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and so we went there, and we took a book with him and, uh, he was, he had a, uh a little notebook and a, a, and a map of France
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's very, very different from the, uh uh, uh
B:	Yeah. Oh I'm sure it was wonderful.
M:	Uh, I was there a couple of years ago for Christmas and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, we, it was a lot of fun.
B:	Was it hot?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Really?
M:	Yeah, it was really, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I was born in Saudi Arabia and, uh, when my father worked there we, they used to travel quite a bit, all around you know, in, in Europe and whatnot,
M:	Yeah.
B:	but I was very young so I don't remember that and, I was three when we moved back here.
M:	Yeah.
B:	So I don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
B:	and that I was when I was a baby but so, Morocco I think would be wonderful because that's, you know, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.
M:	Uh, uh-hope so.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they'd just run off the, the river, into the desert, you never know what's coming
B:	Yeah.
M:	you could just go in and, and sit down and have a good meal and, you, you're not missing anything
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I think the best thing about the paper work is that you can go back and, and pick up the pieces and get it the next day.
B:	Really.
M:	So, I think that's what we did.
B:	We, we found that in Jamaica. It was the same way, that people would come up and try and sell you, well try and sell drugs and things like that
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
B:	but they, they were so destitute and I guess they, they make all their money on tourism and, and they would come up and ask you, you know, if, if you want to buy different things and really, after awhile it really gets annoying,
M:	Uh.
B:	you know, it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.
M:	Yeah, it is, it really is.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's, it was a really bad time for them because they were used to being, you, I think, used to be you couldn't tell them where to stand and where to run and how to hold them.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's not like you're going, you know, if you go into Marrakept and you go to, uh, you're not going to get anything at all.
B:	Oh really.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Really.
M:	and, uh,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	it was the best feeling.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, we didn't have to worry about, you know, being in debt all the time.
B:	Uh-huh. Well that's great. Where else have you been?
M:	Uh, I haven't been to Europe. I went to England on my student visa
B:	Well you lived in France,

B:	Now when was that, when were you there?
M:	Uh, about, uh, oh, about nineteen eighty.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we went to the, uh, to the National Park.

M:	So, I was, I mean, I had a hard time getting my visa.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Was it very expensive?
M:	Um, we, we had to stop because we were afraid we were going to end up losing our house, you're right.
B:	You're kidding! No kidding! Uh-huh.
M:	so I really did not know what to expect, and I went ahead and got the car,
B:	Uh-huh.

B:	All for a thousand dollars?
M:	Yeah, it was, it really was.

B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they had, they had nice comfortable, comfortable, uh, comfortable interior.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, and you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive, because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're,
