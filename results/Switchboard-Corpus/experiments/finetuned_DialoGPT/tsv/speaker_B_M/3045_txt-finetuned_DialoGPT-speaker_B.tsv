B:	And my in-laws also have one, and they're almost as close.
M:	!!!%
B:	They're in Richardson.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Um, usually, uh, word processing something, um, such as, oh, forms for things, uh,
M:	Uh, what type of things would you use for WordPerfect and,
B:	also I have a nine year old that I've been home schooling for the last three years.
M:	Oh, uh.
B:	And we got, uh, the one that my parents have is an Apple Two E.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I have a sister-in-law who is, who works in the Fort Worth school district.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And so she got me copies of, uh, several of the Apple programs for school programs,
M:	Uh.
B:	and so we use those and there's some, whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game, so, that's part of it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Um, my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things. Uh, his resume, his, uh, letter,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	he's been applying for jobs and things, so that type of thing. Uh, forms for his photography business, and that kind of thing.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I, I don't know, I just, I'm not into, I guess I'm, I'd put it that way. I don, I, I think I'm probably in the minority.
B:	I'm, uh, my father had a software company,
M:	Uh.
B:	and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing, here
M:	Uh.
B:	But, um, they're kind of old older
M:	Uh.
B:	so I'm not sure that we'll be able to do, get too many other programs for it.
M:	Right, yeah.
B:	Oh. I have one of those. Yeah.
M:	And I just love it. I just, I just don't like it, you know, I, I think it's so,
B:	Mine's broke at the moment, but
M:	Well I, I'll, I will let you start
B:	Oh.
M:	so,
B:	Yeah, I learned, I, I learned Wordstar, uh, I did some typing for my father when he had the company
M:	Yeah.
B:	and so I learned that on there too, that was,
M:	Yeah.
B:	I haven't. That's the one that my father, well, I guess I have used it once or twice.
M:	Uh,
B:	Uh, it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer.
M:	Yeah, yeah, uh, I think that's, that's what we have, um, we use, um.
B:	He's got on I B M.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, uh, so that's the program that they're using there.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	That's what I've heard.
M:	and I, I'm, I guess I'm a product of that environment, you know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	you had to, you had to make sure that you were writing a, a properly set of programs.
B:	Yeah, you had to, memorize it,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and,
M:	So, what are some of your favorite shows?
B:	Oh. Oh, that's neat.
M:	And so, you know, it's, it really makes it easier.
B:	Oh, how wonderful.
M:	So.
B:	That, I had heard that that was better. That was a better one.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah. Yeah, I agree
M:	I mean, I, I can see the kids, you can see their parents sometimes,
B:	Not too much. What kind of, what kind of things do you write?
M:	!!! Remind me!!You're my first one!! You're my second one!
B:	Oh
M:	and, um.
B:	to her Go talk to Daddy about it. Excuse me.
M:	And, uh.
B:	to her Go on and talk to Daddy about it Tell Daddy I unplugged it for you. But you don't need to drag it down the hall
M:	Oh.
B:	Daddy, Daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that I had unplugged
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Huh.
M:	and, um.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I'm, uh.
B:	Yeah. I'm anxious some day to have one here.
M:	Well, I think it's going to be here in a couple of weeks, I, we're going to buy one of those, so,
B:	I'm, and they just talked to the other day other day about setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	My nine year old I've decided to teach her how to type using the computer,
M:	Uh.
B:	so.
M:	Yeah, I'm, I, I I'm trying to get her to, uh, learn how to do that too. She's, uh
B:	Yeah.
M:	So, I guess we're both pretty, uh, uh-huh, oriented in that respect.
B:	I've,
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Auto attacks.
B:	That's right.
M:	And, and, uh, it's, it, it seems to me that, that, uh...
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
B:	We've been, we've been, uh, writing a story together.
M:	Uh, well, you know, we, we had, we have a daughter that's almost two now, and, um
B:	And so I, and I wanted her to put it into the computer, and then print it out and, make a book with it, you know.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	And so I decided well, if she's going to do that, it would be a whole lot easier if she could type
M:	Yeah.
B:	So we'll slowly learn just to type here and then then put the story in.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yes, yes. I agree.
M:	I think that, uh, she's a very good example for young, young families to use, uh  for their,  adult children.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I really do enjoy it.
