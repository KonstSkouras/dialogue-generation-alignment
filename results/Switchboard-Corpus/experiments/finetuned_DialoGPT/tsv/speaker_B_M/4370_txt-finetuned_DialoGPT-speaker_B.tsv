B:	I can't remember which. I was on a jury trial last year only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got.
M:	Oh, really.
B:	Um.
M:	I, I mean, I, I don't want to say I don'y know. I, it's just that I don tinker with it too much.
B:	That, uh,
M:	I, I, I know a little bit about that, uh.
B:	Right, but it still has to be a group of your peers.

B:	So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them.

B:	So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant.
M:	!!!%!!!,!!;!! Remind me of that one.
B:	So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat, but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards.
M:	Yeah, that, that is a good point.
B:	I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be.
M:	Uh, I know, I'm not sure I understand why there's such a difference. I mean, you know, like in civil cases, you get one person who's guilty and you also get people who are conforming that they would be guilty, but then you get people that, you, you're saying, you think, well, I, I'd, I would like to know if they sentence me to death for, for conforming a jury that would make me happy.
B:	Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure.  Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure.
M:	Yeah. I think so too. I, I, uh
B:	Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. But when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side, and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury.
M:	Right.
B:	At least in California, they're supposed to be. Not during the trial, during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. They get too boring.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
B:	Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time.
M:	Right.
B:	So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant, you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, I think they ought to start doing something about, about the, the crime rate, I mean, I don't know, it's just, it seems like, you know, the, you hear these stories of people stealing cars and, you just never hear the, uh  of, of actual robbery or anything like that,
B:	Well, uh, say, embezzlement, right. You get a guy down the street who comes up, uh, carrying a
