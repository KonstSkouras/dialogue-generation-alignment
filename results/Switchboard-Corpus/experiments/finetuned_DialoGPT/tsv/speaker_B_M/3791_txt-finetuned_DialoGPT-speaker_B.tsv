B:	Yeah
M:	Yeah.
B:	No.
M:	No, huh-uh.
B:	"Huh-uh. *According to the following utterance, this is an AFFIRMATIVE answer, so should be ""Uh-huh"" Just my husband and I and the two dogs."
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	So what about yours?
M:	Well, I have a son that's just a, uh, an infant, and he's in day-care for the first two months of this summer.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, but we do cook, uh we do enjoy entertaining.
B:	So I guess it's supposed to be dinner party, is that what they said?
M:	Yeah, that's what we're supposed to do, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh. Huh, we don't,
M:	And then, uh.
B:	Think you,
M:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, but I, I think it would be a good idea to have a dinner party. I would love to have some crawfish.
B:	Uh-huh. Sometimes we'll have, uh, we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Huh?
M:	Like, uh
B:	How do we usually?
M:	We usually, uh we just, uh uh, you know, freeze them and then you let them cook.
B:	On the grill, we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
B:	and it is good.
M:	Oh, that sounds good. That sounds real good. Where do you usually cook your meatballs?
B:	Real good.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Either that or hamburgers, we really don't have dinner parties.
M:	Right, right.
B:	Uh-huh. Ooh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And it was, it had the meatballs in it and the potatoes and onions and, uh
B:	Did you kill the deer?
M:	No, I didn't kill the guy. I, I, we, we were out hunting and he got in and just, he, he bit and killed a couple of them.
B:	No.
M:	Oh, no.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	But, uh, I've never had a real problem with deer, I mean, they just, they seem to go right through you.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, we've had, uh uh, the same thing. I, uh I, we had deer in our area once, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh he shot himself in the foot about three or four times trying to save a tree from a tree
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	you know, and then they have the, uh a special dinner and then everybody brings a dish and, you're supposed to bring whatever you want and bring whatever friends you want.
B:	Oh, well, that's nice.
M:	Yeah, it is.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, they, uh, they just, they did it as a family activity.
B:	Yeah, we still got some from last year.
M:	Uh, yeah, that was a big one.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I don't know, I, I guess I, you know, in, in Texas, we have so many different kinds of things you can buy
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. We we usually have most of it made into, uh, hamburger meat, though. And cook, you know, spaghetti with it.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Chili.
M:	And, uh.
B:	So,
M:	It's good. Yeah, I, I like, I really like Italian food.
B:	Uh-huh
M:	And, uh, you can make it ahead of time and chop up dill pickles and put them in there.
B:	Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Um.
M:	We, we try not to, we don't go out that much. We try not, you don't have to go out to dinner that often.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they all come over and play and I have my grandchildren come over.
B:	Oh.
M:	And, uh it was absolutely wonderful.
B:	Oh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	This isn't a good topic for me right now. I'm on a diet
M:	Uh, what kind of exercise do you do?
B:	Um.
M:	It's, uh
B:	Yeah, I have, too. I was real skinny till I was ten.
M:	Oh.
