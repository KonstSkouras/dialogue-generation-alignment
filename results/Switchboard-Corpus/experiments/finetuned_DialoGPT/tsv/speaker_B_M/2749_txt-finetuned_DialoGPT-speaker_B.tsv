B:	Uh, I don't, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,
M:	I think, the judges have the final say.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	And I think that's a really good idea. I mean, I, I really don't know if they should have a jury like that. I, uh
B:	Exactly. Uh-huh. Uh, I don't know. I, uh, you, you rarely hear, you hear, of course there's cases where someone has been put in, in, in, uh, prison, uh, falsely accused but, uh, more than likely the people that are on the, the jury know what they're doing. Uh, I mean you,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Never.
M:	I don't think I've ever served on one.
B:	Huh. Well, you would think that they would get that in the, uh, when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and I, I know they automatically, when you go through, uh, when you're chosen is, you're automatically like a, a, a professor in criminal justice or something like that, that you're automatically, no they don't want you on the jury.
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	Exactly. Uh-huh, exactly. Uh,
M:	I mean, you know, I don't think that there's a whole lot that the public wants to hear about.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	it's just that, you, you have to be so, um, oh, oh gosh, I can't even think of the word.
B:	I've, I've never I've never even been called to jury duty.
M:	Uh, you've never been called.
B:	Yeah. I, uh, I don't know, I think the, I guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system
M:	Uh-uh. I agree with that. I think that, uh I don, I'm not sure if I believe that the criminal system is perfect, but, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	you got to kill them both ways.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh  and get a reasonable, uh you know.
B:	Right.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	They, they're very, very, uh...
B:	I, uh, I I, I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Least with the jury you have twelve people, you know that are going to decide, you know,
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
B:	judge
M:	Yeah, I, well, that's true.
B:	Right, exactly
M:	so,
B:	Probably, yeah Yeah. But, uh, no, it's, it's sad, though, that, uh, that the people, though, that you, you, somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less.
M:	Right.
B:	And, uh, or they fool the, the defense in thinking that they're, you know, because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly.
M:	So, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then you get someone who, who's very ill and has serious problems and they have to go through this whole set of criteria to get them to answer the questions.
B:	Oh, yeah. Well,
M:	but I, I just don't think it's, it should be a unanimous decision.
B:	I guess it's just that maybe people are, you know, upset at court, you know. If it was, if it was a, a family member of theirs, though that was innocent and, then they'd want to be on that jury.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But, uh, if everyone would take it, I think if everyone took it seriously
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!! remind me!%
B:	Yeah.
M:	It would be a good thing to do.
B:	I would love to be called, I'm ready to go They just haven't called me up yet
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	It was nice talking to you.
M:	Well, have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week.
B:	Bye-bye.
