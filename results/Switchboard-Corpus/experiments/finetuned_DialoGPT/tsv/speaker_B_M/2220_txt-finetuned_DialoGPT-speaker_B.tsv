B:	Uh-huh. So you like a, a variety.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Sort of easy listening because you like country but then,
M:	Yeah, and, uh, I, I like country music, too.
B:	Um.
M:	I mean, I just, I like to listen to whatever they're saying.
B:	Oh, uh-huh. Yeah, I, I like some of his songs, though. They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. They're just kind of sweet sometimes.
M:	Yeah, I do too.
B:	You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know
M:	Uh-hau.
B:	Yeah, my truck's broken down and my house just burned down, you know.
M:	Oh, my.
B:	But,
M:	Well, that's all right.
B:	No.
M:	Well, he's a, he, he played in a couple of symphony orchestras.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	He's a wonderful man.
B:	Are, are you, do you play the piano, is, or you just like it?
M:	Uh, I like it.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but I, I don't know, I just, I like the, I, uh, I do like the sound of the, of the concert band.
B:	Yeah, it must be fun to be able to play it and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.
M:	It is.
B:	because I mean, I play the flute and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh, I like classical music just because of the, when, I, I don't play, I like jazz music but
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	What's that?
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	What's that?
M:	!!! Remind me.
B:	Yeah, I like a lot, like, I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the, I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection.
M:	No, I haven't.
B:	Yeah, I love those, too. They're just so relaxing.
M:	And then I also like, like Garth Brooks.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and then you hear the beat and then you get to the lyrics and then it's just, you know, you just,
B:	Yeah.
M:	But I, I like just listening to it and then getting the video and then watching it at home,
B:	Isn't that nice. I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know,
M:	Yeah, I know.
B:	and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, but, it, it's mostly relaxing and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or, but, uh,
M:	Right. Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. Oh, I see what you're saying.
M:	So, but, but they're, they're really interesting.
B:	Yeah.
M:	Well, that's interesting.
B:	I, I can't identify them either. I just like them. I could, I know which ones come next, but I don't even know their names. Most of them I don't know their names of the song, but I, I can identify them. But I like that and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, uh,
M:	I like the old, uh you know, the old stuff, like the, the, uh the old Doors, you know.
B:	I was in the band, yeah
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff, so I'm used to pieces and, and I played classical flute, I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, so. I I can relate to it, I suppose But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too, because I like Chicago
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh, you don't know Hebert Laws, but Hebert Laws a flute player, he's a jazz flute player and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione, do you know who Chuck Mangione is?
M:	No, I don't.
B:	Yeah, I like Chuck Mangione Trying to think of all, uh, oh, what's his name, plays the trumpet. Yeah.
M:	Uh, I know, I, I think that's, that's a good one.
B:	Yeah, I like Moody Blues. I, I like mostly the older groups I think. Oh, but we do have, I like Simply Red, we got Simply Red. I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like And, uh, I like Breeze, I like the group. I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No, it's, it's got people singing, but it's it is instrumental. But it's, it's got people singing but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing.
M:	Oh, I didn't like that at all.
B:	You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the he can't hear me. I, I don't remember how many people, but, it's, it's got men and women and it's not, it's, it's nice, I mean it's pleasant, you know, music. It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It's, uh
B:	Oh, you must live in this area.
M:	No, I live in, uh, Plano, Texas.
B:	We're in Sherman.
M:	Sherman, okay.
B:	Oh, okay. You're going to Commerce?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	For East Texas or something?
M:	For West Texas.
B:	Oh, okay.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, okay. Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. That's why I was just
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah, East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	No more, huh.
M:	Well I'm going to school at, uh, University of Texas at Dallas.
B:	Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant and that's what I know, so, and, uh, just nothing basically
M:	Yeah.
B:	No, no, it, no I don't go to East Texas. I got a degree from T W U, but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, but I don't want to be a lawyer so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	So, I thought, well, this is a little over my head, but, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
B:	Yeah, that's how it works.
M:	So, we're going, we'll just go there, and then we'll go to the one that they've selected and they'll call us back.
B:	And this is the man that was in front of you?
M:	Yeah. He's a attorney in Garland, Texas.
B:	Oh, well they'll, weed him out.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And he was just as surprised as everybody else, because they all had their, had their little, uh, pets and, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	"I said, ""Okay, I'll let you start."""
B:	Well, not necessarily
M:	But if I did, I would be a very, very unhappy person.
B:	but there's probably something else that might make you. Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue. Uh, I think there's a lot of things that can be done about it. I don't know, I just think it's a very complex thing.
B:	I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. So but,
M:	Well, that's, that, that would be true. I mean, you can't say that, uh
B:	Yeah, so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know,
M:	Right.
B:	because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment. So,
M:	Well, I, I don't know, I think that that, that we, uh you know. I think there's, I'm not sure that there's any way that we would, uh be able to completely eliminate all of the criminals from society. I mean, if, if we just eliminate all the criminals, I mean we're not, we're just going to solve the problem.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, you, you have to, you've got to get people who are not swayed by emotion or by, uh, you really know, uh facts or whatever to, to, uh.
B:	Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like, do you really feel that sure about,
