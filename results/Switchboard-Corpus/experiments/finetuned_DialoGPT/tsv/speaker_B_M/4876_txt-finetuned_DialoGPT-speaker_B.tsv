B:	Uh-huh. Well I am a working mother I have three children and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young, I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it. I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children. My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.
M:	Well, I guess, I mean, the, the difficulty with that is that, uh you know what I'm telling you is that if, if you're going to have a child who's going to be a good parent, you can't just leave them at home.
B:	So I, I, I, you know, it is a problem. And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford. When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
B:	And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools and they were really all day preschools and they were wonderful. And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.
M:	Uh-uh.
B:	But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune. I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.
M:	Wow.
B:	So.
M:	Wow.
B:	Well, I I'm a physician. Uh  and, as is my husband.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And, and I felt, uh, very good about working. I'm a pediatrician actually.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,
M:	Uh, what type of work do you do?
B:	Oh. Well
M:	I mean, I, I'm not a career person. I mean I'm, I work full time and I travel, I do that, I travel and I do other things.
B:	I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in. And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh, I'm with the university actually
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work. And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing. And they had wonderful, they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.
M:	Uh, that's great.
B:	So that, that sort of an, most of the teachers had degrees. Uh,
M:	Yeah, yeah, I, I think that's a, a good thing.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	It was incredible actually
M:	Oh, I know.
B:	But it was good. I mean it was, it, at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra. But the kids were,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	I mean they really had some great opportunities. But, what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.
M:	Yeah, I think, I, I agree with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, you're not going to see that.
B:	Uh-huh. No, even that, that really, I think, I don't, it's been awhile since I've looked at, my youngest child is eight. So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers. But they are
M:	Yeah.
B:	you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so that's a pretty good savings.
B:	Something like that.
M:	Yeah, I think they're up to five.
B:	Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children. I mean it has been a real, uh, there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences. And I think, I think they have captured a certain market. Again the, but then there are baby-sitting groups. As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
B:	As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around
M:	Uh.
