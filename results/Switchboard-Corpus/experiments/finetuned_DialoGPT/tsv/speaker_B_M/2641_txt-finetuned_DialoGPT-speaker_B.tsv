B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we never did get around to cleaning them up,
B:	Yeah, I like having cats around or pets around in general I, I favor dogs over cats actually but,
M:	Well, I, you, you think that, you don't think that a dog can really take on the responsibilities of being a parent and, and parent, you can't really be a good parent and expect to be able to take care of your kids and everything,
B:	Oh, I'm, I'm a dog person. I had, I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, um, I,
B:	But not cats.
M:	No, no, we like, um we like dogs, too.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I know some people, um.
B:	The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek, of the dogs, and constantly .
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	You know, so, um.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, um
B:	Limited.
M:	yeah, but they're, they are a lot of fun.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	and, uh, you can, you, you don't have to mess with that.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they have this little plastic thing that fits in the back of it,
B:	Oh, that sounds so easy, what I did,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, I housesat from cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis,
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	and what we used to do was just put, um, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then I would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing.
M:	Uh.
B:	Then I would do it, you know, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and so it wasn't so bad.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling, I would put just a little bit of cat litter in there, because if I put a lot, one of the cats would have been,
M:	Oh.
B:	all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.
M:	Uh.
B:	I that true, yeah. Yeah, she's even got, she's got one dog now and the two cats and her dog there is, is basically a reject, somebody had bought him, and wanted him.
M:	Oh, yeah, uh-hue.
B:	It was her ex boyfriend and, you know, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was and now, she's stuck with it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals but I think that for me, well, my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it. So, you know,
M:	Yeah.
B:	No, we don't have anything right now.
M:	Well, that's good.
B:	Oh, right, now we have a kid but he was, no, completely against having a dog or cat, he said, they're much, they're as much work as a kid, and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend, And,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, that, uh, dog.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then we put a little fence around the yard, but it's not like, it's like, you know, it doesn't, it, it won't do you any good, and it's, it just, it takes too long to get out and get back in the house, and I think it's a lot of work,
B:	That's, uh, yeah, really true. But like the friends, other friends of mine have cats, they have four of them, and if they go away, they have, they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats, you know, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	and, you know, they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that. I, I tried to have, um, figured something having, so I tried to have a goldfish,
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and, um, I killed that one within a very short amount of time.
M:	Oh, my gosh.
B:	Right.
M:	you can't just leave them in the yard and leave them out
B:	My brother had fish when I was a kid I remember that, and one of his fish jumped out of the, um, gosh, what do you call it, fish tank. And fried itself, on the radiator behind the dresser. I'll never forget that because I remember my brother, he came home and he counted the fish
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace, they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on, the radiator behind.
M:	Oh, no.
B:	it was not gross, I didn't see it but, um, got them.
M:	I'm sure you did.
B:	Trying to remember we had a dog for a while, and I don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it, my brother had asthma and some allergies which I think he's outgrown now,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish.
M:	Uh.
B:	And you, they're, like you say, they're not the most exciting pet to have.
M:	No, no, no.
B:	Well, a friend of mine had, um, an eel,
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	and then he had a, um, I forget what type of fish it was, it was one of these fish that it would eat, it ate a big other fish and things like that. There would be sort of moby fish in a tank.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, and it, I, I couldn't see having fish like that.
M:	Well, I think, I don't know, I guess it's, it's a lot different now that we have all the conveniences of living, you know, when you have, you don't have to worry about people getting sick, you get to know that you're not alone, you're in a, in a situation where you have to have people around you,
B:	I could see some having, maybe some of the tropical fish, that are really, really pretty but,
M:	Right.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they would just kind of, you'd open the tank up, and they'd eat the mice, you open the bag up, you get the, the, you got the chance to eat the, uh the rats, and the grub, and then you could feed them, and all kinds of other stuff.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, they're, they, they are used to running around in the warehouse with them and, you can see them running around, you're right.
B:	Yeah, no, that would be, what did they do, everyone come around and watch them.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah, well, I don't know.
B:	I mean, I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house, and your things destroyed the mice.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	But,
M:	but that's, that's not really fair.
B:	Let's see , I had a pet rat, for a while, and it was a live rat, and, um, this woman just offered it to me while I was in, in graduate school and, she was actually a very fun pet.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, she said it was just the most wonderful thing that she had ever had, and she, she had never owned one, and I said, I just want to have one for my kids.
B:	Yeah , mine had been a, a, a how did this work, a mill rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, you know, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick, and she said, I don't think he's sick, I think she's pregnant,
M:	Yeah.
B:	And they had misclassed the sex of back there and so, um, she asked me if I want to, one of those babies, and I took the baby and I got her when she was, you know, just this tiniest little thing like, half the price of a mouse,
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	and then she grew to be, you know, I had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big, you know, like a pound or something
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	I don't know how much, and I had her for over two years and she was very affectionate. She would, you know, crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working, and things like that. Yeah, much more than you would think.
M:	Uh, I guess that's a good thing.
B:	Yeah and,
M:	Well, I think that's good.
B:	Yeah, I, sort of weird for me to have had one too but there, it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage and, you know, it was easy. Easy to take care of
M:	Yeah.
B:	and but,
M:	Well, we have, we've had, uh, a couple of different pets. Uh, one of them was a, uh a cat and, uh  she was a hamster.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, they say that the hamsters are the best pets.
B:	Actually it was more fun than you would think. Yeah, starting from the beginning but, um, yeah, we live, also live in the city now, actually in Manhattan.
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	And so it's almost impossible to, it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here, or certainly, certainly not a dog,
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
B:	I mean, people do,
M:	Well, that's true.
B:	but it's not,
M:	Yeah, I think, I mean, it, it seems to me that, that, um, the, the only thing that, you know, that I don't like about pets is when, you have to have them
B:	Oh, yeah, you see all these people, yeah, these stately people, and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them, it's really kind of funny.
M:	!!!%!!etwork!! That's, that's funny, because that's, I, I know a lot of people who work at, at, uh, uh at the, uh the university, and they say that the, the people that work there are very, very nice.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's just, it was really, really, I, I can't remember the word, it just bothered me.
B:	Right, no, they don't. I should make you ,
M:	Okay.
B:	they have, um, the bags behind them but I think they're actually supposed to, keep them, yeah, keep them clean
M:	Oh, uh-hum.
B:	but, oh, gosh, I can't even walk by Central Park yeah when summertime, just the smell is so bad of the horses.
M:	Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, well, it's not that long ago. It was , Oh, twelve times, of the year.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, the, the weather, it just, I don't know, it gets so hot in the summer time, you know,
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, we went to the, uh  to the park and playground.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that was a lot of fun.
B:	Yeah, that's not too far from were we live, do you have, you said you had two cats, are they, um, just what you call it, are they breed cats or anything or are they just,
M:	No, no, no.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	they're, um
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they're real spooky.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but she's, she doesn't know them yet, and I, I, and then I just get them when they're young, and they're so cute,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so, you don't see them very often.
B:	They're both females?
M:	Yes.
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	they both have, uh, very, very definite personalities
B:	Uh-huh.
