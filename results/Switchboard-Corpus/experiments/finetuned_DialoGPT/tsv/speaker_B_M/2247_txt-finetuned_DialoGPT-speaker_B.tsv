B:	It's eighty eighty-eight?
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay. Uh what type of, uh, utilizations do you make of it? Word processing obviously.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Okay. Uh, I use them both here at work and at home.
M:	Right.
B:	And I have I B M clones in both cases.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Here at work I have the T I one thousand which is a three eighty-six base machine.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Yes, it is. Uh, unfortunately I need all of it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, for example, I was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And that, I know that, uh, brings an eighty eighty-eight machine to its knees because I had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty-six machine,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and it brought it to its knees. Just in the ability to handle.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	And then I have, uh, a three eighty-six F X a sixteen bit machine, at home.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And I'm really pleased with it.
M:	I bet.
B:	It manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and, uh, databases, database searches.
M:	Oh, yeah. Uh-hue.
B:	Uh, what I've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them. Have you,
M:	Uh.
B:	To try to make them more effective and useful.
M:	Yeah, and I know a lot of people who are very, very against it.
B:	Have you been, uh, struggling along those lines?
M:	No, I haven't.
B:	Well, I think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as I used to call it. It's, uh, I used it on, uh, some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it. It was a real memory hog when you started making large blot changes to it.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	The, at least the version I had tended to keep copies of that. Of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of, all of a sudden you got a disc full error. Not a fun thing to try to recover from.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Very frustrating. Uh, but again I've been dealing with large files both data and, and otherwise. Uh, that was a engineering spec on B two. You come here with the B level of specs?
M:	Uh, yeah.
B:	Well, it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build. Uh, to one level down from assistant description.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I sure need them. Uh, there's no way that I could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that I need to, to try to do my job without them.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yes, uh, maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things. I think that's when you, you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have. When you start seeing what all they can do for you.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Well, I understand that you know. if, needs and wants were the same I'd have a four eighty-six machine at home
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh-huh.
B:	Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year.
M:	Yeah, I was going to say, it came out with a lot of stuff.
B:	It does a few more things, uh, than had been available before.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But I'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement. Uh, you know, once you get passed thirty-three megahertz, all help is, kind of lost in the, in the translation. Because you no longer can think that fast anyway.
M:	Yeah, I don't know, I think that's one of the big problems with, with American cars. I think, I, it seems like, uh I think it's just too, too expensive.
B:	Well, okay. I enjoyed our discussion.
M:	Yeah, it was nice talking to you.
B:	You do the same.
M:	Thank you.
B:	Bye.
