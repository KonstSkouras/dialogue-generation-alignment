B:	you want to buy American.
M:	yeah, I'm not sure if I want to do that or not.
B:	Um.
M:	and I like that. But, uh.
B:	It terms of handling, uh, acceleration,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	What about Mustang G T
M:	!!! Remind me!!clamation!!
B:	Those, so you're talking about ones in a lower, lower end, price range.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
B:	Right. Well, you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money, you can buy whatever you want.
M:	That's right, that's right.
B:	Right, would you use that for city driving and racing?
M:	Well, I would.
B:	Autocrossing is, what kind of track is that?
M:	Uh, well, it, it is a trials type of thing. It's, uh, you race the ball.
B:	Okay. And you put up, set up the track, pylons. Okay.
M:	And then you have to go up the piers and all that stuff.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	And, uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, I would guess so.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh, I think I'd like to get, uh, B M W or if I go the German route, which I'm kind of leaning towards right now, but, uh, or maybe a, I mean, a, a Acura Legend. Uh
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	a Lexus, uh, S C three hundred maybe. Something on that order.
M:	Yeah.
B:	You know, because your B M W your German cars have good reputations, I think.
M:	Yeah, well, they do, uh-havings for, uh you know, for different companies, and I think that's what I'd really like to have.
B:	Yes.
M:	and, uh.
B:	The, Yeah, they, their, they have the whole philosophy, I mean, they, they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better, which is kind of hard to take
M:	Yeah.
B:	I mean as you're walking through that little tour in, uh, Munich, it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you, too
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	Yeah, it, it really was.
B:	Um.
M:	!!!%!!!,!!!'!!That!!;!!You!!We!!Okay!!And, uh  they're, they're really nice cars.
B:	Yeah that's,
M:	so it's really not a quality, I mean, I, I don't know, I guess, I'm not a big Lewis fan, but, I wouldn't buy a Lewis, uh
B:	No, it's not realistic.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, if you can afford that kind of a toy, then, I guess, uh
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, just work, short trips. No no heavy mileage. I'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year.
M:	Wow.
B:	So it's pretty minimal.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Lasts a long time. That's mainly what I'm looking for.
M:	Yeah, well, I've got, I have a, uh, I don't know, probably five or six cars total that I'm going to use right now.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	The Mercedes certainly are nice.
B:	But, But if, if you have a problem with a Mercedes, you take it into a shop, they're going to, they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh, I think, well, something on the order of a three series, it's probably different. Once you get up in the five series and higher, then, all your repair costs go up significantly
M:	Yeah, yeah, that's true.
B:	So I'm kind, yeah, I'm not sure if I really want,
