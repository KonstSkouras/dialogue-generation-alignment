B:	So,
M:	I've never heard of that before.
B:	Um.
M:	and, uh.
B:	Oh, yeah.
M:	And so, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	So he's, he's really into that. Um, I, I don't know, I think that, um, you know, that, I guess the, the most important thing is that you don't have to be so totally out of it to like go to a concert or something.
B:	Oh, they did?
M:	Yeah.
B:	How did, How did they get involved in that?
M:	Uh they just, uh, went and bought a flute and played the flute together.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, they had a, a, they, uh they had like a sign up and they had people there, you know, sign up for, uh classes and things like that.
B:	Oh, how fun.
M:	So, uh, they, they got a lot of participation and they, uh and then the, the city said, well, we don't want any of our children involved. We want to focus on our own children.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Um, uh-huh, um. Yeah, yeah, that's nice. You say have your four year old taking lessons already?
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?
M:	Well, it's, uh it's kind of hard to say. Uh, he's, he has, uh a, uh I guess a mixed breed between, uh uh, uh...
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, um, it's, it is, it, it does give you a sense of, uh uh, of security.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and it, it's a lot of fun. I, I really enjoy that. I haven't gotten around to, uh  doing that yet.
B:	Oh.
M:	And he just, he just can't read, so.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! translated!! english!!ety!! translate!!
B:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Well, because my,
M:	But, uh, I have a, I've got a dog also.
B:	Pardon me?
M:	Do you go to any musicals?
B:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five
M:	Uh.
B:	because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. She just,
M:	Oh, that's wonderful.
B:	So I wasn't sure when to start her. I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene.
M:	Uh-oh, uh-hoh.
B:	Uh-huh Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think that's kind of a waste of a person.
B:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, I think she'd like to, I just don't know if it's really, knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.
M:	Right.
B:	It was something easily forgotten. So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or, or should I say seven. I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. She does have to really work at it, but, uh, so,
M:	Well, I guess that's, that's what I mean by, uh.
B:	Yeah, but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I, I know a lot of people that work in the system and they, they say they spend a lot more time on the computer than they do actually on the actual answering machine.
B:	Uh-huh. Oh, that's good.
M:	So,
B:	Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method, have you had any former Suzuki students?
M:	Well I have, uh.
B:	I was wondering how,
M:	Yeah.
