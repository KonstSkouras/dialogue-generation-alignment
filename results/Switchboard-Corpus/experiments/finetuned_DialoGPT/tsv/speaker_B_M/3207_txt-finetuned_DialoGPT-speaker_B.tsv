B:	Yeah. It's
M:	And, uh
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, so, it's, it, I think it's real important that, uh you know you do it right, because it builds character.
B:	Oh, really?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh  they do a lot of, uh they do, uh you know watching the T V and stuff.
B:	Right.
M:	But, uh,
B:	To put her in a rest home?
M:	Right, yeah.
B:	Um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	She says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's,
M:	Uh, how old is your granddaughter?
B:	and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. It's, it's a hard decision, but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally
M:	Uh,
B:	When he retired?
M:	Uh, about three months ago.
B:	Yeah, it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	So that, that works out good.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, you know, I'm, I have two girls and, and, uh I'm going to have to quit because I just, I just don't want to work.
B:	Really?
M:	and I'm sure that they'll be at least somewhat better.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	we're going, either we're both going to live in a big house or we're not going to do anything.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, you're not going to feel like you're out of the house.
B:	You think? I, I I'm not really familiar with how other countries,
M:	Well, I think, I, um, I'm from the, I was raised in the south, and, uh, I lived in the, uh Texas, area for a while and, and my mother and father were both from that area, and they were, uh they were very similar people.
B:	They're seen as senile
M:	and, and, uh, and that's, that's the way they're perceived, I guess, by people in the country. But, um.
B:	Right.
M:	I don't think people really respect the, the, uh, the social changes that have occurred,
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, so it's, it, it is, it really is a problem.
B:	Right.
M:	I mean, they're, you know, they, they've got to have that.
B:	Uh-huh. I know.
M:	But, uh,
B:	Um, I'm twenty.
M:	Twenty-two.
