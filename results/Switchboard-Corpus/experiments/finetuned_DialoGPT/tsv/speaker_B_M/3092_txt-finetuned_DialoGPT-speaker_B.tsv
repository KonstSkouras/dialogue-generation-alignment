B:	Have I?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Uh, no, not actually
M:	Oh, okay.
B:	Okay.
M:	Yes.
B:	Right.
M:	!!!% You're married.
B:	Okay.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Right. I, I think that job wise benefits are just as important as salary is.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Exactly,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	exactly.
M:	and, and I would be very unhappy with what we are paying, you know, if it were to have any benefits at all.
B:	Especially when you have a family, with children, and you are always going to the doctor for,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Exactly,
M:	Yeah.
B:	they always do.
M:	That's right, I know.
B:	Yeah, I think any, any, even if your insurance policy is not the greatest.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Exactly. You you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time just by yourself.
M:	Right.
B:	Also, for working women uh, I think a lot of the companies should start providing for day-care in the, in the, in the building.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. Like in may case, I have three children *spelling: 'may' should be 'my' from ages nine to two. And, it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that I would, be making would be going to day care.
M:	Uh-hue.
B:	And it would be just,
M:	Uh, I don't know, I think it's really important that we decide what we want out of life.
B:	basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care,  center.
M:	Yeah. Exactly. And I would be willing to work for somebody that would be able to provide me with some quality day care for them.
B:	Exactly.
M:	But,
B:	Besides which, it would be easier, uh, there's a lot of single mothers out there now, from divorces and a lot of, women are starting to have babies without a partner.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And to go to work, you are worried about your child, besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care.
M:	Right.
B:	And if they were in the same building then you are going to the same place,
M:	Right, right.
B:	and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child, or, you know, and take your breaks with your children, or something.
M:	Yeah. That is true.
B:	I think I, think it would be fair.
M:	Yeah.
B:	I think if, if the company could not provide it all on their own, for the, for the people that would be using it, you know, a certain amount of their salary would go to it.
M:	Yeah.
B:	But it would still probably be cheaper with the company helping,  our if everybody, you know, pulled their own weight in it.
M:	!!!% Yeah.
B:	I think it would be really. really great.
M:	Yeah, yeah, it would.
B:	Yeah.
M:	It would be a lot cheaper.
B:	I do.
M:	Well, I think, I mean, I, I would like to see, I like to have the ability to, to look at other people's lives and see what they have to say and, you know, and, and that's what I, you, you just, you you just have to go with your gut.
B:	Eye care is good. I do not, I am not I do not think we have that on our policy.
M:	Oh, I see.
B:	But, uh, we,
M:	I think we need to, uh.
B:	Yeah. It would be great, I mean, uh, the glasses that, the exams themselves are not expensive, it's the glasses.
M:	Yes, and they are not, they are expensive because of the different types of glasses. Uh, the one that is good for, for women is the Plano, uh glasses company.
B:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	But, um, you know, that, that is one of the things that I think is really important, and I think it's really, really hard on the elderly.
B:	Right, now like my ... Right. Well, like my mother, she has to go for testing cause she has got,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
B:	Well, she does not have it, but, she is like, on the verge of it or, something.
M:	!!!%!! translated
B:	Her eyes are changing,
M:	Yeah.
B:	and she has to be tested periodically. And, and those are expensive tests.
M:	Yes, I, I think that, uh,
B:	Now, I think your insurance covers her on that,
M:	Uh, yes, I do.
B:	but you know, for something like that, that's just as bad as a medical, you know, that's,
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
B:	Right.
M:	And, uh,
B:	Right.
M:	So, uh.
B:	Now, I would like to see better dental insurance to me. Was that our beep?
M:	Oh, I think so, I was just listening to a program on the radio, and they were talking about, uh medical coverage,
B:	Oh. Huh.
M:	So I have to say I would not have chosen the dental plan over the health plan.
B:	Okay.
M:	and, uh, I have two kids and so, I don't have a lot of time to watch T V, so.
B:	But, with the three children um, orthopedic care, um, not orthopedic, orthodontic care,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	because on, on a lot of the dental insurance, they do not cover that well. For the, the orthodontia stuff.
M:	Uh, uh-hauhuh, uh,
B:	Yes, it is.
M:	Uh, but, uh, but they, they're, they have, they work with, uh you know, other companies that do, that do.
B:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	And then, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh
B:	Right. My middle child needs to have, uh, orthodontic, he's because his, his pallet is squared, not rounded.
M:	Uh-oh.
B:	And it affects his speech a little bit, not, not anything, you know,
M:	Right, yeah.
B:	Right.
M:	So, I'm, I guess, I don't know how I feel about it, but I don, I, I think I would probably be more comfortable with a, a person taking care of my child.
B:	But just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars, and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it.
M:	Oh, really?
B:	Oh.
M:	So I'm going to have to do some consulting work on it. I'm not sure if I trust them or not, but I do, I do trust them.
B:	Really.
M:	So, uh, I,
B:	That sounds like it would hurt more.
M:	I would think it would.
B:	Oh, gosh. I, I would much rather that, do that, to myself than make my five year old go in and do it. That would kill me.
