B:	Wow.
M:	But, uh.
B:	That's great.
M:	Yeah, she's, uh, she has, uh she's been, she was a good, good housekeeper before, before we got married, and, and now we kind of have a, a little bit more time to, to think about it, but, uh.
B:	Yeah, well I, I have a dog that God gave us too,
M:	Yeah.
B:	Yeah, she just appeared.
M:	Uh, I guess that's unusual.
B:	Yeah, my husband calls her street dog, but we've had her now for about three years,
M:	Oh.
B:	and I just, you get so attached to them.
M:	Uh, my, my little girl, is three and a half and she's nine months and she, she's just, she, you know, she enjoys going places.

B:	Um. Wow.
M:	so he just, he went back to the vet and, you know, they said, you bet, he's fine, he'll be fine. And so he went in and he was, uh-hired and, and they said that it was just the, uh the, the, you, you just, uh you just have to, you have to keep him off of drugs to be completely content.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um, I mean, you know, he was, he, he had, he really was able, to, to cope with what he had.

B:	Oh, I bet.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh gosh.
M:	and, uh and I, I felt like, you know, it was a big mistake to let her go.
B:	Yeah, yeah. How long has it been since the first one?
M:	Oh, about a year.
B:	Uh, yeah,
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah. Well I had, I had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just, it just absolutely destroyed me. I mean I was just, you know,
M:	Oh.
B:	I couldn't even talk about it for months and so I decided well that's it, I'm not going to do this anymore
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And then God gave me this dog, so
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	so he gave it to this little boy and he, he never did get it back.
B:	Yeah.
M:	But it was just a, uh a pure accident and they took it to the vet and they said it was, uh it was a male and female, uh
B:	Okay, yeah. Well you just do,
M:	and you do, do you like pets?
B:	you can't help it's like, it's like a kid.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah, well when, uh, my, my doggie, uh, that we have now, uh, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	The vet called her, uh, a golden mix
M:	Uh, what kind of mix is it?
B:	like who knows, you know.
M:	!!!%!! translated We have a purebred Golden Retry.
B:	But she's, uh, she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color, you know.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
B:	And, uh, and her nose is that pink, you know,
M:	Oh, that's pretty.
B:	she doesn't have a brown nose, and her she's sort of unicolor, you know, eyes are the same color and everything,
M:	Oh, my goodness.
B:	so. I named her Rosebud, and, uh, a friend of mine said, she, that she this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had, uh, a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name, said my cow lived seventeen years
M:	Oh.
B:	Yeah, right.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! Remind me of that
B:	And she's so easy going and so sociable,
M:	Right.
B:	You know, she loves everybody. And little kids can just, you know, maul all over her,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and she just, you know, thinks it's great.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh they, they didn't, they don't like to go fishing.
B:	Getting in, yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh, no.
M:	I mean, it's just, it was, it moves fast.
B:	Really.
M:	He's, uh
B:	Did puppy go to?
M:	Yeah.
B:	Oh, that's good, yeah.
M:	and she just, she just loves to go out and play.
B:	Ugh, ugh.
M:	And so I'm sure she was, you know, going to be okay, and she was fine, but, you, you can tell she was still a puppy, because she was just a little puppy.
B:	Yeah,
M:	And, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	and she was in a, uh a, in a building, and, um, it was on the front of the store, and she was on a building with a bunch of people, and they were all jumping around. And the smell was just awful. And, and I just couldn't believe that.
B:	Well the German Shepherd that I had before, we, we had a little pool,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and, uh, she was, she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to, to get in the pool on the first step. She'd just get on the first step and lay down. You know in the summertime when it's really, really hot.
M:	Oh.
B:	And she'd just lay there on that step and just, you know, cool off
M:	Uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, it was nice, it had a pool, and she liked it, but I don't know if it was too comfortable, I donno.
B:	Yeah Well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.
M:	Uh, that's true.
B:	Yeah, and she, oh baths. Oh gee, she hated baths worse than anything. It was, it was just really a fight to, you know, get her clean.
M:	I bet.
B:	Have you seen, uh, CANINE. The movie, oh,
M:	Yeah
B:	you've got to see it. Especially since you have a German, it is so cute.
M:	Oh, I know.
B:	Yeah, and, uh, an part of the, the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's, it's just hysterical.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	he, he would run out in the yard, and he would just swoosh around and look at the water.
B:	Yeah, well that's how Cleo, you know, she'd lay on her step,
M:	Yeah.
B:	but that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
M:	Yeah
B:	Yeah, but you really need to see that movie. I, I we bought the movie and I I don't know how many times I've seen it.
M:	Oh, I, uh, I don 't know.
B:	And it came on T V the other night and I was watching it again, and my husband heard me laughing and he said I can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
M:	Oh, yeah, that's true.
B:	It is great.
M:	It's, uh.
B:	Yeah.
M:	I think that's a good thing. I think they ought to make movies that are good just, you know, you see them real often and then you can enjoy them.
B:	Well we always wait until we can rent them, you know
M:	Yeah, right.
B:	Oh really.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Oh.
M:	So.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's, uh.
B:	Oh, yeah, there's just,
M:	You know, I think that, uh
B:	Right, that's it.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Really, not critical at all.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	Yeah, they're really wonderful.
M:	Uh-huh.
