M:	Oh, you do?
B:	In Garland, right outside of Dallas.
M:	Oh, Garland, okay.
B:	So, we're getting a large oh, gosh, I don't know, I think there's like twenty-six different languages now, that are spoken in I, the I S D. Dallas Innercity School District.
M:	Oh, uh, uh.
B:	Cambodians, uh, Asians, Vietnamese. We, we're getting a lot of, uh, Mexican Americans, you know, we've had,  those for a long time.

B:	To get them on their, Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Right,
M:	And then you're saying to them, you know, well if you let them into the nation, you'll make them a slave to the nation and then you'll be taken care of.
B:	Um.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	You, you don't see the violence inherent in the people that are running around and, you can't blame them. You know, I, I think that's a, a big problem.
B:	And there's a lot of graft, like people trying to tell them, oh, giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it.
M:	Right.
B:	Yeah.
M:	So.
B:	Right.
M:	And, and they don't, they don tinker with, with things that are not as good for the country as they could be.
B:	You mean, really trying to plant something? That's what you're saying?
M:	Right, and then they have the, the people that, that are, that can work on it.
B:	Farming?
M:	yeah.
B:	Oh.
M:	so, you know,
B:	Oh that's terrible.
M:	but, uh, they're doing real well, and, uh.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, it just, I just don't see that, that that, you can do much about it.
B:	And not being cared for.
M:	Right. And that's the way it's going now.
B:	Yeah. That's true.
M:	and I think, uh.
B:	Well, what did you do when you helped these people?
M:	!!! RemindMe!! = Did you help these people when they were children or,
B:	How did you, what did you do,
M:	I helped them with their homework.
B:	All right.
M:	I was just, I was helping them learn how to speak their own language.
B:	Uh-huh Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
B:	Well, I'm an E S L teacher.
M:	Oh, you are?
B:	Yes.
M:	And I teach in a school system,
B:	I got my certification. But actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language
M:	Right.
B:	I mean, it's like people don't know, what they say,
M:	Uh, well, that, that is true.
B:	it's not step for step.
M:	and I think, you know, they, they probably don't want us to, to say, oh, you're a good gardener, you do this, you must do this.
B:	Yeah
M:	But, I, I think that's one thing that I think we've come to, to expect in the future,
B:	But anyway, I enjoy it. They, they, the kids I've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And
M:	Well, that's neat.
B:	but I'm applying for, What? Yeah, it is.
M:	It's Spanish.
B:	A lot of our words are the same,
M:	Yeah.
B:	like, you know,  they just change the pronunciation a little bit.
M:	Right. Right.
B:	But, I love it. I love the culture, uh, the way that they, uh, they respect education and their teachers their parents, so much more than, than my children do. You know,
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	and I like it. And what I've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this, uh, Asian center that, a Doctor Falk has started, that works with the school district.
M:	Uh, that's wonderful.
B:	And doing what, trying to get them set up, inculturated,  into the system.
M:	Right.
B:	I thought that would be good experience for me.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And, I've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian.
M:	Yeah.
B:	And I think that would be wonderful too.
M:	Yeah.
B:	Right.
M:	So that, that's a real negative, I think.
B:	Well, the times were different too.
M:	Oh, yeah.
B:	My neighbor, let's see, is Jewish. And he's going through the, I don't know, the Jewish League or something. And helping a family that's come over from Russia.
M:	Uh-huh.
B:	And he spends, well, right now, he's down to like once a week, but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family,  and help them with the language.
M:	Oh, uh, uh.
B:	And he thoroughly enjoyed it.
M:	Oh, that's great.
B:	No.
M:	I don't know.
B:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
B:	Uh-huh. What's so sad about this is both of the, the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but,  their training isn't what we need in this country.
M:	Right.
B:	And because they're so deficient in English, they haven't been able to get jobs.
M:	Right.
B:	So they'll have to go back and get a degree here. You know, almost start all over.
M:	That's true.
B:	No, no. And this woman was, uh, stocking the shelves in a drugstore.
M:	Oh, my.
B:	I feel sorry for her.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
B:	Well, thank you.
M:	All right.
B:	Have a good night.
M:	Bye-bye.
B:	Okay. Yes, I do
M:	Okay
B:	Okay, Bye.
