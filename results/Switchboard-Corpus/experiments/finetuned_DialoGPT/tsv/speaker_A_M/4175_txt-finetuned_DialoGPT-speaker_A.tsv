M:	I'm not sure what the steps to take, but I think that, uh.
A:	The one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything. They pick up newspapers and, uh, you know, milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans, you know, like soup comes in and stuff.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	They pick up everything.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	so they have a little recycling truck that they throw out and they have people come in and they pick it up.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So,
A:	Yeah
M:	and we're not sure what's going to happen.
A:	Uh-huh. I know it, I know it.
M:	I don't know.
A:	It piles up.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I just don't know.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I just don't know and now they have, like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because, mean, until seven o'clock, you got to pay to park at the student center, you can't really unload all your stuff.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's, uh, I'm, I've always, uh.
A:	I know it, I know it.
M:	it's a lot more convenient, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	I do.
A:	The ,
M:	I don't know if I do or not. I just, I, I just feel that I have to do something.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, and you know, and it's like, oh, my God, they're cans.
A:	Well, I mean, it's real, you ought to, because the, the, the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And since we go there all the time, I mean
M:	Uh, well, that's good.
A:	probably at all.
M:	I mean, we've been there twice and both times it, it, you know, it didn't, it really didn't do anything.
A:	Oh, by the way, may name's Julie.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Hi.
M:	Hi, Bill.
A:	I'm from Atlanta.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Neat.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I just think that everybody ought to do it.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	The only thing I know that you can recycle is milk jugs.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	Oh, yeah, they have, uh, uh, what I, what I used to, uh, now that I don't go to the grocery store much, it's kind of moot, but I used to just save up the ones that I got one time and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	but, also most places, like Big Star does and I'm not sure if Kroger does or not but,
M:	Yeah. Kroger probably does.
A:	Yeah, and they, they have like little, little boxes that you can put your old bags in.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Can bring them in.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	I know it, I know it.
M:	And I don't know what we're going to do about it. You know,
A:	It really is a small,  hostile planet
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Did you know that, No, really not. Did you know that, like, something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper? Filled with paper.
M:	That's right. That's right, and, and we, we have to, we,
A:	Huh?
M:	I mean, you wonder, I, I wonder, you think, you can't, you could make it anyplace totally different from here, you don't have to worry about being a vegetable.
A:	Well, it is, it is, though.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	It is, because they,
M:	I don't know. I, I,
A:	Well, they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper, you know takes something like twenty times as long to decompose.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	You know, you can bury a piece of yellow paper, it will still be there in a couple of weeks.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah
M:	Well, that's, that, that is pretty good.
A:	it will be whole. You'll be able to read  off of it.
M:	Yeah. That's right. That, that's right, and, uh,
A:	Yeah, um.
M:	And I'm going, you know, to, I'm just going to do it the same way.
A:	Well, white paper's bad too. They, they treat it, too.
M:	Oh, I know.
A:	I'm sure that's fine. I'm sure. Maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again.
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Maybe.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Okay.
A:	You think? I don't know, well, I mean, I think we've kind of, you know,
M:	I mean, there's no hope.
A:	I mean, everybody, everybody everybody has a computer.
M:	Yeah. Right.
A:	We would no longer need paper at all.
M:	No, no.
A:	I would love that.
