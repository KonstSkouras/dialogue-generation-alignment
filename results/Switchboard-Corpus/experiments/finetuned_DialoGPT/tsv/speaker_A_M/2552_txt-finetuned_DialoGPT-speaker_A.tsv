M:	Uh.
A:	and then when I would come home and he would leave, and, um, so I think one day one of our kids said, you know, someone came home and they said, well, when is dad leaving or something. It was like that they thought that's the way life was, that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time.
M:	Right, right.
A:	And so I think, um, it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family. So there's one or two nights a week, we have a, on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called, uh, family home evening and we stay home that evening, all of us, and we do things together.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Oh, you are?
M:	Yes, I am.
A:	Yes and,
M:	Oh.
A:	So you do that and, right, and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday, usually in the morning.
M:	Right.
A:	Right, and then, you know, sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but, We're, it's real important to us to spend time together.
M:	That's right.
A:	I have two.
M:	Oh, well, you're one of them.
A:	Uh-huh. I have a girl and a boy, and the boy's five, he's in kindergarten, and the girl is four. She'll be in kindergarten next year. Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, my youngest daughter is eleven and my oldest daughter is two. And, uh
A:	They are a handful.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh  you know,
A:	Yes.
M:	and we're still, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Well, no, and it's, it's just not, um, it's not as stable for the kids,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and they, everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now. But, uh, it's, yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me
A:	Well, it's also important, I think, um, for my husband. I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because, since I am home with them and so I get a lot of time with them, he needs to have, um, some time with them.
M:	Right, right.
A:	So he, when he comes home, he, um, you know, it's his job at night. He puts the kids to bed,
M:	Uh.
A:	and he reads to them,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and he spends about an hour doing that, and that's, that's pretty good quality time, with them,
M:	!!!%!!;!! RemindMe!! remindMe!%
A:	and, um, but it's hard for him on Saturdays. He, he wants, Right, he wants to run out and get things done,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so, um, I try to say, well, why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something.
M:	Oh, that is, that would be good,
A:	And if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that, that's what he wants to do.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, and I think that's important, because you can tell when they're, when they get older, you can see how much they've lost.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they had a nice big roast, it was like roast beef, you could feed it for two adults and then roast the potatoes and then you had, uh, like a big roast beef sack full of fresh berries and then put on aitas and onions and then a little bit of Amaretta and some crayon wine and then just cover it with foil and put it in the microwave for just a minute to cool it up.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they had, they had this little light that they put on the outside of the car so they could, you could see what the, the emissions were.
A:	Yes.
M:	so we left and then we came back and it was dark, and we were gone so long.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but we didn't know that.
A:	Well, that's right. But I do think, um, you know, like the current trends are that, um, the family unit is devaluated. It's not nearly as important.
M:	Uh, I think that's probably true.
A:	We find that, you know, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems, the first place they went to was their family.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	And families took care of themselves and, um, but now, you know, people don't, they don't support each other that way.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it, it just, you, you don't have that anymore. You have to work for it.
A:	That's right and,
M:	and so it's, it really is a waste of someone's time.
A:	Right, right,
M:	And they don tinker with that, and, you know, they don, they aren't, you don't see the mistakes in every work place,
A:	And it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make, because, you know, I, you know, I have interests that, too,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it is hard to make, uh, those interests not be as a major part of my life.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I'm like, I'm not that old, but I just, I just can't seem to stick with it.
A:	Right.
M:	And so, it was a little different.
A:	It is temporary. It, in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
A:	but you're right, it is temporary. Well, I see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids
M:	Uh, that's true.
A:	and, and, in spite of,
M:	Well, I, I think that, uh, you know, that, that the, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I'm sure, you're not alone there.
A:	Yes.
M:	So, I, I think, you see, you don't see too many single mothers having children. You see more single mothers, um, having children, you do see more, um
A:	That's true.
M:	You know, I mean, I, I've had people, uh, let's see, I had a friend who was a teacher and she said that, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, it really is, you're right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and she just, she just really doesn't care about the child either. She's just, you, you just have to accept that as it is.
A:	Well, it is, the hardest thing I've ever done, as much as you'd go out
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	and,
M:	I just, I was just thinking, I just, you know, I have to, you just have to find a place, you have to make it, you don't have to go out and buy it,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Well, that's good.
M:	and, uh, it's just, you know, she's such a wonderful person, and I, I just, I really, I'm just pulling for her.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	so that's really, uh.
A:	No. Yeah, I think so. I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious. You can at least say that it's important to our country, that our family unit stays strong.
M:	Uh, well, I know my wife's mother in law is a, a, uh a practicing vegetarian.
A:	Yes.
M:	But, uh.
