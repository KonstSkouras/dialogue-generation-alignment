M:	I had to, uh, I had a, uh a Springer Spaniel that I had for about a year and a half.
A:	Instead of being carried
M:	Yes, that's right.
A:	Yeah. Really.
M:	but I was real concerned about the, uh the safety and the welfare of the dogs.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I called one, one trainer and one person, and one of them was a woman, and she was a very pleasant, caring individual,
A:	Huh.
M:	!!!%!! translated It's a Bishon, or a Saint Augustine or something like that.
A:	Yes, I've seen those. They're cute.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me. I've never seen those
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they're very protective, very caring, uh.
A:	Oh, she's about four. She's not completely pure. We got her from the, uh, Humane Society when she was a puppy. She looks like a she looks just like a Golden Retriever, but she's a little bit smaller. She's like fifty-five pounds.
M:	Oh.
A:	Is it?
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh
A:	Huh.
M:	You know, and, and I don't think, I don, I, I think it's just, I'm not real sure what the, the, what the breed is.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they're usually pretty well bred.
A:	Oh, huh.
M:	And, uh, the ones with the, the ears and the eyes, the one with the ears are the ones I really like the best.
A:	Yeah. She's perfect. Well, she's got a brown nose instead of black too.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	Which makes her, I guess, unshowable, even if she had papers which she doesn't
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	but, but we love her anyway. She's just a lot of company to us. We didn't, we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer, but up until then, she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun.
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Right. Oh.
M:	and, uh, I had, I have a setter, a Sheltie mix, and she's a medium size.
A:	I bet it had a pretty coat too.
M:	And, uh, they had, they just had a regular old white shirt, and a blue-green color shirt.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, and, uh.
A:	We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures, and I wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding problem.
M:	Well, I, I don't know if it is. I don, I haven't, uh, you know, I hadn't thought about that.
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	And it's a dog that's, uh, uh
A:	Oh.
M:	And, uh it was, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah. They did. I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before. We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other, we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very, uh, social and stuff.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down. And one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling And that, was mine.
M:	Did you just take her home?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, they, they breed them and then they, uh they, the dogs are, they're actually put in a home so they're not really trained in any way.
A:	Oh, really?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh.
M:	And they have to learn how to act and act out of a two part, uh-haugment.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It was, it was a, uh a cross section of the United States.
A:	Oh.
M:	So, they bred these dogs and then the people who bred them, you know, when the, when they got to be very old they had these, these, uh, uh...
A:	Huh.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Because, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and so, and, and so,
A:	Huh.
M:	They have a very, very, uh...
