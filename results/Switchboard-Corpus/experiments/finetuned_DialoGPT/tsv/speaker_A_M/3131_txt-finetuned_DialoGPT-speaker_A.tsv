M:	And, uh.
A:	So it was pretty much a physical decision?
M:	Yeah, it was a decision on the part of the family that she felt was important.
A:	Um.
M:	And so she was pretty good about that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, I guess, uh.
A:	My husband's family are reaching that point but it's, it's so difficult. Was she in favor of it or, or was she kind of opposed to it?
M:	Um, I think she was sort of in favor.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, she was, she didn't want to be a burden anymore. She said she didn tinker too much with it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, um.
A:	So often I think though, elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad. I work with a lot of elderly people, I'm a trust officer
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hud.
A:	and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes. Well you know that's part of the aging process,  That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It really is.
M:	I know, I know.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	So, I mean, it's, it was a wonderful movie.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, I mean, she, she had to kind of take over the house.
A:	And the portions, people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals. I do that right now,
M:	Yeah, I don't know, I, I've never tried it. I've, I haven't even heard of it.
A:	and I'm not near nursing home age.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice.
M:	Well, they're,  they're starting to make that,  a lot.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, um, she had to go back to work because she had cancer.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh  she was able to get her house back,
A:	Oh yeah. That's a given.
M:	and they're going to take it home and sell it to you.
A:	Uh-huh. And sometimes the, the help there does it, I think.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh  I guess, you, you need to have a, a, uh a monitoring system in place of your desk where you know when things like that are going to happen.
A:	Adapt.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. I, as I think I mentioned, I was in the trust business and I've seen so many elderly people. Usually there has to be some wealth involved, which is great, if, if you're financially, if, if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but  the, the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the, the retirement places where, where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better, as far as elderly people adapting.
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
A:	They're able to move in while they're still independent and still social
M:	Uh.
A:	and, and they do group things. And then if health or, or mental capacity deteriorates, they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh, I wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in. It's really kind of difficult.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	so, I mean, we're not all like that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	because, uh.
A:	Well and it's the first step in, in actually accepting that you are failing and, and aging.
M:	Yeah. Yeah, and, uh, you know, I think, uh I think that's one of the things that we've come a long way, but I, I guess it's still, uh.
A:	You know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and, and I've seen people really fight it that desperately needed  to make the change.
M:	Yeah.
A:	They, they became, in fact, that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother. She's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision. And that scares me the, the thought of forcing somebody to do something.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's a dog house.
A:	Not as independence.
M:	No.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I think it would be neat if you could have a reunion with your family.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, you, you get, you want them to be able to, to do their job.
A:	Yeah. And the quality of life really isn't there.
M:	No, it isn't.
A:	Oh it's tough, it really is.
M:	I know.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I think that's a really important thing.
A:	Well, they fear being dependent  on somebody.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	They, they fear being a burden to, to family members.
M:	Yeah.
A:	My husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation. She'll let something slip and we'll say, wait a minute. And, and that's it, she, just, well I didn't want to bother you. She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah. Well, she stayed, she stayed in a temporary nursing home.  Until she was okay.
M:	Oh.
A:	You know, it's just, but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her. She's down in Temple
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on.
M:	Uh.
A:	So, it's difficult, it really is and we're all heading that way and,
M:	Well, it sounds like you all are doing a lot better than we are.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So we're going to be in Arlington.
A:	Yeah
