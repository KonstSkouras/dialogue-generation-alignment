A:	It's the least hard on your body as far as, uh, impact
M:	Uh, right.
A:	and
M:	I don't know if you have that up there but I do, I have a friend who has a, a, uh a regular old horse, uh uh, carton that he, uh he keeps in the back of his truck and, uh
A:	Right, right.
M:	It's a little harder to get the hang of, but it's, it's a lot more fun.
A:	Well, I do, uh, little aerobics, oh, three or four times a week, but it's not enough to, boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles
M:	Uh, uh.
A:	and, uh, well, you know, even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and and go jogging for, uh half hour or so,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but so, I'm not quite getting the level that I need to.
M:	Yeah, yeah, that, that was, that had to be a real challenge, too.
A:	I like it.
M:	Yeah, I do, too.
A:	I like it, uh, part of my problem is I have small children, so, uh, to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, oh, coordination as far as scheduling and that type of, uh, deal, you know, uh,
M:	Uh, that's true.
A:	Of course, you got a little different direction going, but, uh.
M:	Yeah, I have to agree with that. I have, uh I have a daughter who is a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts. And, uh  I, I thought it would be neat to be able to go to a, a college party with other friends and have a few people come with,  you know.
A:	Right, you don't notice it  as much,
M:	Yeah, I don,
A:	yeah.
M:	Yeah, I'm in college, I don't even know if I ever go to a gym, you probably don't go to like a gymnasium or something like that.
A:	You feel it, don't you?
M:	Yeah.
A:	It's amazing how, uh, how much, uh, it changes, and I weigh probably about the same I weighed for, oh, I don't know how many years, but, uh, it's changed places And things don't fit just quite exactly fit the same.
M:	Right.
A:	But, uh, so, do you do, uh, in Texas, uh, does there, probably quite a few facilities.
M:	Uh, I'm not sure. I'm, I, I do know that, uh
A:	Do you enjoy it, or is it, uh. If you can have, find the time it's just the.
M:	Well, it depends on the person, I guess. I don, I, I enjoy it. Uh, I think I'm, I like to work out with people, you, you don't have to be physically powerful to do it.
A:	Yeah, it is hard
M:	Uh,
A:	it is hard. It's, uh, like anything else whether or not you want to sacrifice another half hour.
M:	Right.
A:	My problem is I don't want to wake up another half hour earlier and do more
M:	Uh, well, I have to admit I'm not as good as I thought I'd be.
A:	Don't get enough sleep as it is, right
M:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh, kind of have, if you're having the pressures of school and, uh, everything else, it's kind of, course it's really, you know, as soon as you do it, it's really a release.
M:	Uh, yeah it is.
A:	You feel invigorated and you feel oh, you feel in a lot better shape just like eating right foods.
M:	Uh, yeah
A:	If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.
M:	Right.
A:	I do. I have to be real careful.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Did you?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Makes a lot of difference.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, there's a lot of fat in meat.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Right.
M:	and you know, it's not like it's, it doesn't, it, it goes right down to the tablespoon or tablespoon.
A:	And unless you really like, uh, fish. Fish is pretty good for you, but, uh.
M:	Right, I do, too.
A:	Kind of see what happens.
M:	But, uh
A:	I've tried to do that with sugar
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	everything has sugar in it . I mean, if you go, your ketchup has sugar in it.
M:	Right, right.
A:	Course, and I like sugar, too, that's that's a problem,
M:	Yeah, yeah,
A:	but. Anyway, well, it's, uh, nice talking to you. Think we've, uh, covered all the subject.
M:	Okay, well I enjoyed talking to.
