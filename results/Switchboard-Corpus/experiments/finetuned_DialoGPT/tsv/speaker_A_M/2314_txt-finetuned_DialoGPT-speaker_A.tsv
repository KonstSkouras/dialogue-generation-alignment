M:	And I think they ought to test just about anybody any time they see fit.
A:	Well, how do you, how do you feel about, uh, companies drug testing prior to hiring?
M:	Uh, I think it's a pretty good idea. I think they ought to test at, before they hire.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I think they should do it everywhere.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I don, I don'y know how I feel about that.
A:	Well, what about random testing, though.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	Do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested?
M:	I don't know. I mean, I don't, I, I think that's, that's the whole thing. I don tinker around with it, you know, I'm not that good at it,
A:	I don't know that you do. If it's random, then it's random
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and that's not necessarily fair.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!eting!!
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah. Well, I I know that, for instance, in the N C double A, they drug test and it's not random.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, well, I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	and from that point on, uh, at, the N C double A does have something to do with it, but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem.
M:	Right.
A:	And, and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time.
M:	Uh, I guess that's a little more stringent.
A:	Well, not being a drug user I don't have a problem with that personally
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but I think that might be a violation of someone's rights. If someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently
M:	Right, uh-huh.
A:	and their manager assumes they have a drug problem I mean if someone assumed that of me, I would be upset.
M:	Right, yeah.
A:	It's an accusation, and, and it's and it's based on, on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave, uh, normal, uh, you know.
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-hue.
A:	Right, exactly. I, I don't, the, I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from, from the janitors to the executive management.
M:	Exactly.
A:	What type of job do you have?
M:	I'm an Avon representative.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so I, uh I'm, I work for the government, and so I'm involved in, uh uh, oh, the clean air program, and I work in, in the national parks, and, uh so I've, I, and the reason I, you know, I feel that way is because, uh because the, the problem with the air pollution is that we don't have a, a good, uh system of, uh testing and so we, we don tinker with it, uh.
A:	Well, does your does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger someone?
M:	Uh, well, it's, it, it depends on the job. I mean, uh, I mean I, I can work in the automotive air bag industry, and I've, I worked in the transportation industry for nineteen years.
A:	Well, that doesn't, I mean I ...
M:	I, I think they should have more control over what they do.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, you can't do that.
A:	That is odd. I was drug tested, uh, not for the job I have now, but for the prior job, uh, but I know that they sent, that the job I had before, that, well, the job I have, have now, requested my, uh, uh, my, uh, medical record from my old company
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
A:	so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion.
M:	Uh-uh. Oh, that's, that is,
A:	Well, no, I don't think they can, they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I, I didn't, I mean,
M:	Uh-hope.
A:	they don't know that I don't use drugs. They just tested me once.
M:	Yeah, I,
A:	But, I used to work for a power company, so it was very important that they make sure their employees, especially linemen uh, were clean.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	And since I was just, you know, one of the office folk, I guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly. But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly uh, just across the board.
M:	Yeah.
A:	No, they're, all of them are tested once every three
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	it's a rotation.
M:	That's right.
A:	But it, but again, it depends on what job you're in.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot and the men that drive the trucks with, with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much.
M:	Right.
A:	But, but see, they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what, what the drug testing schedule is.
M:	Right.
A:	They say we, we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, it's, it's made very clear upon hiring.
M:	I know.
A:	Well, have we spent our at least five minutes?
M:	I beg your,
A:	Okay.
M:	Okay, well, I guess that's about all I've done so far.
A:	Okay.
M:	So, um, I guess, I, I'm not real sure what our policy is as far as, uh, the U S government from, uh government as far, you know, from government as, as far from, you, know, government as corporation goes.
A:	Nice talking to you. Bye-bye
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Auto attacks.
