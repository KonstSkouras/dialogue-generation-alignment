M:	Yeah.
A:	I mean, not, not to this large scale as Iraq, but that,
M:	Uh.
A:	whenever we give arms to people, as we did, and as we sold arms to, pardon me, to Iraq, when we wanted them to fight Iran, and then, uh, and then it turn around and,
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. And I know when I spent, the time that I've studied in Mexico, uh, Spanish was one of my majors in college, that, uh, there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America,
M:	Oh, really.
A:	about, uh, like you say, using them, our interest there is, you know, what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them,
M:	Right.
A:	and that we weren't normally very interested in them, and they have, in other, in most Latin American countries, they, there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries, you know, that they have corruption, and, and they don't have, uh, I mean, there's just very few really modern cities.
M:	Right, right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	the, the drug lords and the big market up there, and that's, that, that I think is probably the most, uh-havings in Latin America.
A:	Well, that's right, because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have, uh, have to have that for farming
M:	Uh,
A:	And they don't look at it so much as, you know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	You know, we, we don't, we pay an annual fee for it, and, and it's not, it's really not too bad. I mean, I, I think it's a pretty good idea, but I don't think it should be mandatory.
A:	And I think it's really very sad that north of the border, you know, the United States and Canada is so different, from the from South America, and Central America.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	There's really a disparity between the, uh, what a I would call civilization of the countries, you know.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh it's not, it's, it is not just a problem with America, it, it has to do with, uh the, the, there's a lot of resentment, I mean, the Mexican people are, are, they're a lot more, uh...
A:	Yes, it's really kind of sad, and, that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and, uh, Israel and the Middle East Arab countries, and, and when we have, when we have a lot of problems, right in our own back door.
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Um.
M:	And, uh.
A:	So I guess we've kind of neglected Latin America.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	recently
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah, fairly recently. Well, that's really sad. I hadn't thought about that in a long time.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I guess then, I will go, but I,
M:	Well I, I don't know, it's just, I, it seems like I'm getting older and, and I'm not sure if I'm going to, to stay as old as I want to be.
A:	made me stop and think a minute about, not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I know that it's not settled but, there are other areas that we could focus our attention on.
M:	Right.
A:	Well, thank you, you have a good day.
M:	You too.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	Okay, I guess we're ready to begin.
