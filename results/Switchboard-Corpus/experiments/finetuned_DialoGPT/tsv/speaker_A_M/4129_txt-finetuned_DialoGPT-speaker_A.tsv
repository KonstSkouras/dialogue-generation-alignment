M:	Yes, uh-huh.
A:	Yes, that's similar to Georgia.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's probably true considering, Yes. Yes, uh, I guess in a way that, it, it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Yes. Right, that would be the intent of it.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me.
A:	Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many  appeals.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah, if, if the person who's going to commit the crime knew that they were going to be punished severely, possibly capital punishment,
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, I'm a research engineer, I work, uh, with Georgia Tech.
M:	Oh, you do work with, uh-homing.
A:	Um.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yes.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Um.
M:	and, uh, I don't know, it's, it just, I think it's a problem that we've got to address.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, you know, I, I don't see the problem with it.
A:	Um, that's probably true, but I guess there's other factors that,
M:	Well, I think the, the most significant factor is that we're not spending enough.
A:	But, pumping more money into the school system is a good thing,
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
A:	but it's not going to, Oh, I see.
M:	It's not just the school systems, I mean, there's been things done to try to, to slow down the rate of crime and I'm sure that that has not been,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh they just, they just seem to fit right in with the society and, and I don't know what they can do to fix it.
A:	Um.
M:	And, uh.
A:	So that's a difficult situation.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, yeah.
A:	Um.
M:	and I think they're a lot more hardened, and they're, they're more, uh, they've done more,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I, I think that, that we're in a, in a situation where we need to change the way that people think about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We're supposed to be the masters of the social, uh
A:	Well, that's probably true.
M:	Yeah, but, uh.
A:	Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. There's, there's no easy solution for that.
M:	No.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	or you could just hire people that are trained to do that. I mean, they could, you know, train them to do it, but, uh, you can't just hire them and then, you, you have to train them. You have to be able to train the people that do it.
A:	I'm sure it is, yeah.
M:	But I don t remember if it's, if it was just, if they gave him a scholarship, if he'd be in good standing, and, you know, he'd get some money for it, but it's not like they can just send him to anybody else.
A:	Um, yeah, I don't, I don't, certainly capital punishment isn't going to solve a lot of problems
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, I think that, uh,
A:	but,
M:	I don't know.
A:	Uh,
M:	Uh.
A:	I guess I am  for certain
M:	Yeah.
A:	yeah, in certain crimes.
M:	Yeah, I think that's true.
A:	Uh, premeditated murder. Crimes of that nature, I think should definitely,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	any mass murderer type individual.
M:	Uh.
A:	Um. Uh-huh. Well, you always have castration
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Yes, I read about that
M:	Well that's, that's a, that, that is a good point. I hadn't thought of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, that's what they said in the paper, they said that, uh that the, uh they said the, the, they, uh the civil, uh rights program, uh, that, that the judges have to be unanimous on is not a good, uh...
