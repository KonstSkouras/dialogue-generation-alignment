A:	Yeah. T I got, uh, a lot of advances in it really. Uh, hopefully this will turn out to be a good program for us. We sure need, uh, the business. Okay, Current Events. Uh, you, you've got the question you can go first there, since I called.
M:	Okay.
A:	Huh, that, you're the opposite of me. I drive an hour each way to work and so if I just use time and not say one, which quality is the best, I guess, that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio and then newspapers and T V would be tied after that because maybe I'll catch the, the evening news, like ten o'clock on T V and I,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I really, of course, you, you're in a different part of the country, I, I really listen to a lot of the talk shows, I don't mean the gossip ones, but there's a lot of, on the weekends when I do chores, or whatever, I'm a radio hound I guess, I take the radio with me when I'm working on my car, the lawn or whatever, and turn on, they have everything from lawn work, lawyers, news, uh, veterinarians, all kinds of items, uh, so I'm, I'm a real radio buff, especially on the when I'm doing chores.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yeah, I find it surprising. Because a lot of times, it, here, you know, I'll talk to some people here and I'll mention someone's, some talk host and I'll expect them to have an opinion on why I don't like him and don't listen, they don't even know, you know, what the guys name is, uh. Bruce Williams who does financial work all over the United States. Most people haven't heard of Bruce Williams. You probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	He is in New Jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a self-made millionaire. And, he has it, I, well it's five seventy here, I'm trying to, it's on Cliff, I don't know what the, he's on all stations. You might remember the name Bruce Williams, and he, he is again, national and talks about a lot of financial things. But, the here, I just get a kick out of, uh, well we do a lot of gardening here, so there's, we have an excellent gardener here, has three hours on Sunday and three hours on Saturday. Of course that's not exactly current events. But, I, I'm, I am kind of a radio buff.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	For music?
M:	Yes.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and it travels through the whole house.
A:	Oh, yeah. That's good. Actually,
M:	But it's a pretty good program.
A:	Oh, that's good.
M:	So,
A:	My wife always wonders about that she says, look at that person he's driving and reading at the same time
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh
A:	Right. we get,
M:	So we take the WALL STREET JOURNAL and, uh and, the WASHINGTON POST, and, and then, uh
A:	Go ahead ,
M:	So, uh
A:	Good point. That's a good point.
M:	And, uh  and I, and I don't, I don'y, I,
A:	Oh, yeah. It comes and goes.
M:	Yeah, I mean, I, I was, I guess I was more interested in the Cowboys than I was in the Giants.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And they have a section in the paper, and they have an inventory section that they check to see if there's anything that's not a, uh
A:	Local you mean?
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah. Don't they have city council meetings and all that. Are you into any of that what, what's going on in the city council and the, and the school boards and all that? We have that addition to our paper.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	Okay , you get it from people then.
M:	!!!% Well, we do, we are, we're building a house out in Castroville, and, uh  we're going to put up a, a fence,
A:	Yeah. Right.
M:	And, uh.
A:	My wife and I, you know, as mentioned, the question was, uh, do you get it from people too. And, and, I can say the same thing you do that, uh, my wife is, uh, she reads the paper from front to back and so she'll tell me some stuff and she'll always get mad and say, you didn't read the, uh, well, I always read the sports, uh, what am I thinking of, uh, the commentaries, I can't even think of what it is offhand, and she's always reading something, and she says, why haven't you read that. And, I say, I never have time to read it like you do. But, I always get a lot of my information from the, newspaper through her.
M:	I agree.
A:	Uh, so, I guess we do get it from people too. Oh, you mentioned C N N, of course I mentioned radio and the C N N T V news, you know?
M:	Yeah.
A:	It's the same thing that's on the radio, word for word.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah
M:	It was, it was kind of like C NN N, you'd hear some stuff, but it was not the same as what you'd expect.
A:	and it, because, uh, we have it here at work as a matter if fact, at T I.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have it in the break area, C N N. And, but the reason I say that is on the radio they'll say and look at this, you know. And when I first heard C N N, it only started about, uh, since the war, you know, or right before that. And, they would always say and look at this, and there would be a pause, you know, would be music and stuff and I realized that it's the exact commentary that you have on the, uh, the news.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah, yeah. But, it's still good. It's still, uh, uh, you know, you don't really miss anything.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But, I do, do enjoy since the Gulf War listening to C N N radio too, as well as watching C N N on T V here at work. I don't have C N N at home. Let me turn this radio off, I'm actually at work right now believe it or not. Uh, where was I, I'm, go ahead, your, your turn.
M:	Well, I, uh
A:	Yeah, I've, I've heard that, yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Right
M:	Well, I, you know, I have heard, I guess you'd say, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	And we could tune in to watch, to see what was going on.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	And then, and, and I guess you can even find the ones that are on like, uh C N B and, uh  M B C where you can actually find the names of the perpetrators.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	I never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock,
