A:	And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.
M:	I think so.
A:	It's not unique,
M:	Yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, there's, there are crimes that are punishable by death,
A:	Yes. Uh-huh. Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?
M:	Uh-hope, we, we have.
A:	Right, research triangle and all of that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there, uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	Really?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Really?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Um. Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had. I've, uh, Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, I, I don't know. A, a number every week.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, Dallas is having quite a few. Seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or, or, like I say, drug related. Uh, I guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values. Seems like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, I,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	The economy is lousy
M:	Yeah, and, and I don't know,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, they've, they have a, a real, uh they have real problem with, uh with Hispanics.
A:	Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.
M:	It really does.
A:	Well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?
M:	Well not really. Uh, there's some, there are some really nice ones. Uh we have a, a, uh, uh a very nice one. Uh it's just a, it, it has a basement and it's the only thing that really bothers me. The rest of it is pretty nice. Uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's not always the, the people that are at home are the ones that are buying the most.
A:	Well, that,
M:	So, it's, it is a real problem.
A:	I see.
M:	And, uh, so, I was kind of thinking, well, you know, we're going to have a reunion in a couple of years, and I really like that
A:	Yeah.
M:	so, I mean, I don't, I just, I think I'm getting old, and I don 't like it when kids are involved in things like that.
A:	Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.
M:	Yeah, well, it's, it, it seems like it's pretty steady. I don't know, you, you need to keep up with a lot of things, I guess.
A:	I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything. Uh, I am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs, I guess you would say the neighborhood road, it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts and, uh, I'm over the northeast part of Dallas. It's a, in a nice neighborhood. The houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	But we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as selective as they used to be.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex. You start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.
M:	Right.
A:	But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,
