M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, oh, I know where you live, that's, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I, uh, I live in a, a fairly nice suburb of, uh Baltimore.
A:	Uh-huh. Yes.
M:	and, uh
A:	Yeah, I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea, but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.
M:	Uh,
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right, any ,  on the street, no, I know. Uh-huh. Yeah, and Texas is having a problem right now and it's, the, the, the, the, the I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and now, they can't find them and they're finding bodies in you know, I mean, you think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's over crowded, and you think how is, is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
M:	Uh, yeah, I agree with you there.
A:	I know.
M:	I mean, I, I guess it's just me but I don 't much care about the, about the punishment aspect.
A:	And then,
M:	and we have, we had a, a, uh a population of about seventy-six thousand.
A:	I don't know how Americans are about handguns but, uh, yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to accept the bill to access, to access handguns and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Is it, that's good.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Say, that good, I think that's, like the state of Virginia, yeah, that's great.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and you have,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	so I, I went ahead and got one.
A:	Uh-huh. Right, they're no, the cattiness behind, right, yeah,
M:	you know, it would be a good way to get rid of the salesman, I guess.
A:	I mean I don't like guns in general but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
A:	and how they just well, it hasn't been just but it was in the, I think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad, you you know, this is nothing, and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but I actually, I mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,
M:	Yeah.
A:	I don't know,
M:	so I don't really know.
A:	I mean,
M:	and he was, he was being, he's been free for a while, and then he was caught just, you can't bring him back, you have to keep him away.
A:	So many times.
M:	Yeah, and I think it was, it was just a publicity thing. You know, he went over there and he was being, uh, excused because he didn't want to be a policeman.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! remindMe! remind!!et!! command
A:	Yeah, I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh, he's not the only one,  you know,
M:	Right.
A:	you, you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime, there was something on, and this gets back to capital punishment, but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they buried her alive
M:	Right.
A:	and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man, and, and at the end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh, that's nice.
M:	Oh.
A:	I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting
M:	Yeah.
A:	Right, in that particular instance, uh, but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a and all and be all,
M:	That's right.
A:	that's the problem I have with it, in Texas they think it's and all and be all, they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-hue.
A:	and we just moved here, uh, we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate, and then we were transferred back here, and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and how, you're in,  Rome, New York,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	is that and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	What, what type of area is that,
M:	well, it, it just happened so fast, I mean, it was just, you know, the minute the sun went down, it would just completely turn yellow, you couldn't see the dirt.
A:	is that in term,
M:	yeah, and I'm thinking, um, we're talking about, um
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Sure.
M:	and, uh.
A:	How would,  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,  and things that would,
M:	Well, I think it's improving.
A:	not too bad. Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,
M:	Yeah.
A:	yeah, now, Dallas is a I'm being very sarcastic, it's just a great,  uh, on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,
M:	Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
A:	but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that, I mean, they really are over,  crowded,
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh, and I just, you know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days, I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital punishment there.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, and I'm from Pittsburgh so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up I and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,  years
M:	Uh.
A:	but, uh,
M:	I've never been there and I was there when the first lady that lived there, uh-hugh,  she had a baby and everything.
A:	There you go I don't know that's a different subject,  altogether
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, uh, I don't know I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime. I think everyone would, you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,  vehicle, uh,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,  I think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah,
M:	I think that's true.
A:	do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me, you know,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	uh,
M:	I mean, I, I'd be, I'm, I would be more than willing to go into a nursing home and just, you, you need to, you really do need to do something to help the situation.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, I just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate, I mean I just don't, uh, oh, I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class, and I just, the subject, I remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things
M:	Yeah.
A:	and you're thinking, oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh
M:	Uh, yeah. Yeah.
A:	but, I don't know, methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either I just
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, I, I know exactly what you are talking about.
A:	Uh-huh. Is it, uh, how about the injection,
M:	Well I'm not sure. I think it's more efficient.
A:	is that suppose to be.
M:	and then you're supposed to, you know, and then, and you're suppose to, and it's supposed to be real painless, but it's not supposed to give you any kind of pain.
A:	Yeah. I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states, do you know which way it is the ratio, it's more than, aren't, uh, it's more that don't have it,
M:	Yeah, I don't know.
A:	isn't that correct.
M:	but I don't know, I donno.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and it's, it was a, it, it wasn't a particularly heinous crime, it just, you know, it happened in such a random and unusual way that, uh.
A:	Yeah, I don't know if they've, they did something about I'm not sure if Texas, Minnesota, I, they didn't, they didn't, they were well, did they have it, they were against it, uh, Texas, as I said, has it but I haven't been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,  if they've done it in the last,
M:	Yeah.
