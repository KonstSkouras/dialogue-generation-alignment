M:	Yeah.
A:	And I spend most of my time carpooling
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	The story of my life
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	My kids are involved in sports. My daughter has played basketball for six years, and my son plays football. I, my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes. I know, I know. The insurance.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yes. My son, is in both band and scouts too.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, gee.
M:	So, uh
A:	Right.
M:	So.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh we were trying to do things like, uh you know work out, and, and things like that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	We found this Oriental tile game called Mah-jongg .
M:	Oh, I know.
A:	Have you?
M:	Yeah. And, uh,
A:	Well, it's really fun. Um, one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it, and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's a game that none of their friends know how to play, and they both enjoy it. So if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.
M:	That's true.
A:	So, uh, we play that a lot of them, and, uh, we like to go miniature golfing and to movies.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	We have family that lives outside of the state so we go visit both sets of grandparents and, and take car trips.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, that, and my husband and son go camping with scouts mostly.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	My daughter and, and I hate camping so we go shopping. So that just kind of works out real well.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And, um, I'm a writer by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too, so a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	That's a lot.
A:	So that gives us special time together too.
M:	Well, it does, it gives us time to think, you know,
A:	And she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so I can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yep.
M:	Well, I think that's neat.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, I think it's important that they, uh they have some basic values of, uh you know.
A:	Right.
M:	they want to see the world and they want to participate.
A:	My husband has taken us to work with him, and we still don't know what he does.
M:	Yeah. Well, that's, that, that is, that was a big part of it too, was the, uh.
A:	So, we just say he travels a lot. So, that kind of covers it.
M:	Well, it sounds like you guys are, uh...
A:	Yes. Yeah.
M:	I, I think he is, you don't want to get into that too much, because, you just, you have to find time for yourself.
A:	He's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes.
M:	Well, that's great.
A:	So those are the real killers. If he's just gone,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	he's gone three weeks right now and that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	so we just, you know. I just do the carpooling and, and handle whatever needs to be done. And something major, always needs to be done.
M:	Yeah, I'm with the kids all the time so,
A:	So you just have to, to handle it until he gets home
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	And hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.
