M:	Oh, I haven't heard of that one.
A:	I like that. And then, uh, my husband, he just, uh, subscribed to a wood, he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books.
M:	Okay.
A:	So what kind do you, uh, get?
M:	Well, we've got a, a couple of books coming out, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I, I don't have any of those, so I have to get them all from scratch.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And I, I'm not sure if I've read enough of it or if I'm just not going to read it.
A:	Is it, Yeah, I used to take that. Right.
M:	!!!%
A:	Yeah.
M:	so I, I have to give her a little bit of time, but, uh, she's been real good about taking, you know, things that she can and, and making sure that they're there, you, know, so that, you can't get junk mail and things like that.
A:	Yeah. I don't, I, if I, you know, if I happen to find it, I'll go ahead and read it someplace, you know, if I'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that I never, I never liked that really.
M:	Well, that's, that, that is a shame too, because it, it, you can't read, you just can't write.
A:	I read my newspaper. I can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper  to get here, you know.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me.
A:	In fact, it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays I can hardly wait to get that to get the local news
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, it just, I just, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And so,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, they just run forever.
A:	Yeah, right, right. Yeah, well I, I only, you know, subscribe to the things I'm interested in. I used to be into coin collecting so I used to get the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, you know. I used to get that. So now that I'm into dolls, that's about all I really, really want, you know.
M:	Well, we, we collect collect collect dolls too.
A:	No, huh-uh. Uh, I think they're interesting.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Yeah
M:	I think it's, it's not worth the money that they're making.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you know, I like to read something new every week.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, um, you know, I, I really have no problems with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they're saying that, that, um, the, the way the law is written now, it seems like it's really confusing to people.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well those travel magazines, are that, more or less, show you different countries that you could go to or,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk to you about.
M:	Well, I, uh, I like to read the, uh the, I read the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
A:	Uh, I don't take anymore than that
M:	Uh.
A:	You know, so.
M:	Yeah, that's, that is true.
A:	Well I guess that will be it then and,
M:	Okay, well I guess we're ready to go.
