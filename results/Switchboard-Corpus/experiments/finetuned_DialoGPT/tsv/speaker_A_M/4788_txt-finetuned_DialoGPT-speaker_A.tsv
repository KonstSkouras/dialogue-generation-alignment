M:	Yeah, that sounds like a lot to do.
A:	Well, there's, uh, places in Wisconsin. There's the Apostle Islands, uh which are in Bayfield which is a wonderful place.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then there's also, uh, what we found, uh, in the state of, uh, South Dakota, the Black Hills.
M:	Oh, I didn't know that.
A:	And we just have this, uh, really good time there. One thing is they don't have mosquitoes and, uh, sorry to say,  and, uh, in Wisconsin we do, so, that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your, uh, you know, if, if you're going to go camping, who wants to deal with bugs and, uh
M:	Oh. Yeah.
A:	We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes. They just don't have them and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure.
M:	And we'd have to go up there, you just have to get a, you have to be sure you weren't in a hurry.
A:	Sure. Uh-huh. Sure.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	That was really called roughing it, yeah. I, Anymore. Yeah, see
M:	And I, I did, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Than you, sure. Than it, when you were younger, uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, and we were real excited when we got married, and it was only a couple of weeks, so.
A:	it, with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday. With kids they don't care, you know, uh, a about a lot of things. But as adults, uh, it's like if I don't take a shower every day, I feel like, you know, ooh.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	I, I just don't feel right so. There's lots of places if you're going to go camping. K O A are wonderful. It's kind of it's kind of the, uh, yuppie type of camping because they have showers, they have things for kids to do. They have swimming pools, things like that. If you  can find, uh, some really nice, clean, uh, campgrounds versus, uh, if you go to state parks, uh,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	we have found state parks, not that they're lacking but, uh, they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, you know, a little bit cleaner. You've got the showers available. It's not, you know, in the same category. State parks, you know, you get a little bit fearful too, uh, you know, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled but, uh, you know, it's, it's a little bit different. But, so we've always kind of stayed with a K O A and then, uh, did other things besides just sit at the campground at night. That's the only time you really use your campground. If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever uh, you're camping really is just for like in the evening to start the fire, to sit back and watch a fire, uh, to enjoy that, you know, and then to get up in the morning and get a shower and get cleaned up, that kind of stuff.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	So we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did,
