M:	But, uh.
A:	Yeah, right. Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress
M:	Yeah.
A:	and, uh.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me.
A:	More lax?
M:	Yeah, and, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, you know, I think that's good.
A:	Maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.
M:	Uh, no, I think, uh, I, I don't think there's as much of that anymore.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I think that, uh I think we're going to see a lot more recycling centers where they're more organized.
A:	Right. Right. Uh-huh. Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	Uh, yeah, maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.
M:	!!!%!!;!!et!! Remind me of that.
A:	Oh, yeah. Right.
M:	and,
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M:	I mean, I'm not saying that women should have to go through, you know, the government run health services.
A:	Right. Just wasn't socially acceptable.
M:	No.
A:	Yeah. Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know, and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.
M:	Uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, it was like, you, you're like, well, you don't know what you're going to do because you're not going to get, you can't get pregnant and stuff.
A:	right. Yeah.
M:	!!!!,!!et!!illion!!!.!!eting!!We, we were in the same boat.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, I think that, that maybe there are ways to, um, to, uh, to cope with the problem.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I think that, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and so I, I was real concerned about that.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Right. It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality. Now it's we're protecting our lives. It's a it's a much different,
M:	Yeah. I think that's true.
A:	we have, you know, you can't just, just hope for abstinence.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and I think it's, it's sad.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, you're right, it's, it seems like they're always trying to find out what they can do, you just can't do it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, they still, you know, you have to kind of be a little bit of a person to go and, and be open with everybody else.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, you know he, he talked about the war, you hear these little girls in the background, you go, what's going on, you get out of that, you're not even supposed to hear what they're talking about.
A:	That's right.
M:	And I think that's what they, they look for. I think they look, I don't know, they think it's going to be a happy ending.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I, I don't know, I just, I find it a little bit strange that, that, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	And, uh, you can't find a job now that pays that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then I'll, you know, I'll go and I'll find out something else, you don't, you, you're just not real bright, you can't do anything about it.
A:	Uh-huh. Right, right. Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right. I, I teach swim lessons a lot, and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know, kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.
M:	Right. Right.
A:	You know, besides what, besides what they learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just amazing. Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know, their math is just, every year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know, and, and, uh, students learn it earlier.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
