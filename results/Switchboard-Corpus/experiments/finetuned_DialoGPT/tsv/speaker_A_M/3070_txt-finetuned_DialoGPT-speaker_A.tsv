A:	On my mother's side we've had several, not,  it's not really on a regular basis,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but usually sometimes every few summers. Well, all, see, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.
M:	Uh.
A:	So they're pretty much just reunited always
M:	Yeah.
A:	so it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.
M:	Uh, that's good.
A:	I know, that's
M:	It's not like you're going to go out and buy all these guns that are going to be illegal because you can't do it.
A:	do that, that's true.
M:	Yeah.
A:	How about your family?
M:	Well, uh, we, uh we, we had, uh a, a, uh family reunion in, uh in, in, well, it's just over the weekend, and, uh
A:	Wow, you're,  a pro at this.
M:	I, I, I don't know if I'm a pro or a con on this. Uh, I think it's good that the families get together so often and, uh, the families become more communication and less attachment to one another.
A:	Oh, that's good.
M:	And it's a family reunion from all sorts of sources
A:	And then where do you meet?
M:	Uh, we usually meet in Plano, Texas.
A:	Okay.
M:	and they have a big reunion every year.
A:	Okay. Do you have relatives in Vernon then?
M:	Um, yeah, I have a cousin that lives in, uh
A:	Okay.
M:	Do you live in Dallas?
A:	Right.
M:	Vonwood.
A:	Oh.
M:	So, uh, that's, that, that is a very, very, uh...
A:	Right.
M:	And, uh,
A:	Oh.
M:	and I take them to the park and, uh, have them do, have a picnic lunch every day,
A:	Right.
M:	And, uh, they do a lot of fishing there.
A:	Okay, so this town hall that you meet in, is that like a, um,
M:	Well, it's not a town hall, it, it it's just a, it has like two rooms, and, uh the one room is like a big, it only has one door, and then the other door is open, so you can just go out there and, you know, enjoy the quiet of the room.
A:	Okay.
M:	and it's the first one that we have.
A:	Potato salad and, uh,
M:	and you just heat them up, you know, and then you,
A:	Oh, that's good.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	Uh, and, and that's a real big thing in our family, too, is squash,
A:	Right.
M:	So,
A:	Oh, that's nice.
M:	Yeah, and, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	and so that's why we have, uh, a variety.
A:	Do they always have the, the one person in the family who knows, or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best,  so that's what they get to cook.
M:	Right, uh-huh.
A:	Well, that's good. Well , I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions, so I learned a lot about them. I haven't,  been to a lot,
M:	Oh.
A:	but we talked,  a lot about the, the rituals,
M:	Right.
A:	you all equated the family reunions as,  with the Protestant.
M:	Right. Right.
A:	It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.
M:	Oh, that's interesting.
A:	It was, it was an interesting theory. She talked about the, uh, the Catholics all, it's a home centered, you know, it's all family centered anyway, so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all, your, you don't have to come home, so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe, but when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went out and, you know, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come back home for their reunion, so that,  became their version of the pilgrimage.
M:	Huh. That's interesting.
A:	But she had, it was interesting, you know, I don't know how valid it is, but she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together, and, um, you know, about the bread and the ritual placement. Do you have a, a certain way that everything is placed out on the table every, every year? Is there kind of a, you know, salads go first and things like that?
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Right.
M:	and, uh we, we're all from, uh in the, you, I guess you're from the Dallas area,
A:	Well, that's pretty .
M:	And, uh.
A:	Sure does. That's wonderful.
M:	So, I think it's, it's a wonderful thing.
A:	Yeah. I wish we'd,
M:	We'd have to have some kind of a plan that was able to accommodate everyone.
A:	Right.
M:	So he had to work until he was ready to go and, and so he had a lot of time to think about what he wanted to do.
A:	Right.
M:	!!!!!!%!! Remind me.!!!,!!That's right!!You!!I!!It!!Yeah!!?!!Did!!Okay!!Well!!Hi!!Have you ever had a, uh, a real barbecue?
A:	Wow. You're just, uh, Oh, that's incredible.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
A:	Right.
M:	But I was able to, you, you had to have, have your own people, you weren't able to just walk around and shoot everybody else.
A:	Right
M:	And then we had, uh  uh, a big roast that we had for breakfast.
A:	Have you, have you done this repetitively, or just once?
M:	Yeah, once.
A:	Oh.
M:	and we were there for a week, and I was there for about a week and a half, and it was wonderful. I mean, it, it is a beautiful country.
A:	See, that's we've we had a problem with that.
M:	I don't know, I guess, I don't have a problem. I, I just think that, uh you know.
A:	Oh.
M:	And they're still, you still can't get around.
A:	Right. That's our, was our problem. We had, uh, the first reunion, or the first, you know, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And then the second reunion, people who maybe, you know, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, oh, well, it's not that big a thing this year,
M:	Uh.
A:	and so it kind of wound down,
M:	Well, that's, that was the only bad experience I ever had.
A:	and then finally, you know, you're lucky to get, you know, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else so that,
M:	Right.
