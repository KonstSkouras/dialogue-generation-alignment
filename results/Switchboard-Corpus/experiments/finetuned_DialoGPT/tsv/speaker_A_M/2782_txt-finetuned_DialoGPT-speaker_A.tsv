M:	Uh-huh. Right.
A:	bit. Tell me how yours works. Well, at the I introduced you a little bit to it, a few minutes ago, when I said that we are, uh, we're on the east coast now.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	My husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that, well, we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina.
M:	Oh.
A:	And so naturally we put ourselves, we looked at our budget,
M:	Uh.
A:	and so, what we did was draw up a budget that we thought, uh, was realistic.
M:	!!!%!!;!!!!! Remind me.
A:	And, uh, so, we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory, and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently.
M:	Well, I know that my husband's been working and, and doing other things with his life and, uh he's had to take care of his own business.
A:	So, you see,
M:	And we're looking forward to just traveling and having fun and, and having the time to do it too.
A:	Well, we actually planned for about one year.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, that God because, *listen  it never occurred to  it never occurred to us that it would take seven months.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, what we did was just, uh, decide how we had been spending our money before,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and, uh, and adjusted,  where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and we really, uh, lessened it, uh, our living expenses, uh, more than what we thought we would.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But,
M:	I think, I think that's really important,
A:	Oh, just our own design.
M:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, it, it was, it's really neat.
A:	And the, so, but we've had budgets that didn't work when our, uh, you know, of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked
M:	Uh,
A:	We spent too much money,  until our children went to college, so. So, tell me about,
M:	Well, I, I have a sister who's a, a, uh a, an English major who's in, uh
A:	do you all, uh, have a budget?
M:	Well, I, I'm, uh  I'm a graduate student.
A:	Wonderful. Yes.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Three and a two year old.
M:	and, uh-huh.
A:	Bang, *one utt?? bang.
M:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, um we've been trying, um. We've tried everything, you can go to any store and you can take your clothes out of your own clothes, and they're just like, oh, how nice, how neat.
A:	Well, I think that's important for your budget to be for it to work though, you have to do something.
M:	Right.
A:	Of course not.
M:	but,
A:	Well, I found, uh, that, in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned,  but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, we, we tended to want to keep on giving lavish,  gifts as,  we had done before.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And I really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself, you need to cut down somewhat on your friends.
M:	Right.
A:	Yes.
M:	and we both know that that's not going to happen.
A:	Well, I really do, I think you have to budget those things though.
M:	I know.
A:	Yes.
M:	And you don't want to over do it, you want to make it a habit.
A:	Exactly, although so much per month anyway.
M:	Right, right.
A:	And, uh, that really should be in your but if you don't spend it, it should be in your bank account at the end of the month
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, no, no, no, no.
M:	so we're not allowed to add any deductions, and we're even going to try to, to add some in the, the interest.
A:	You don't want the government to spend your money. You want to be able,
M:	No, I think that, I, I agree with you, I would much rather have the money to do something like that.
A:	Well, uh, but I do realize that, that is realistic for some people,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it was for us many years,  for many years.
M:	Yeah, I think it was, it was a dream back then too, you know.
A:	Uh, and if, and if that's the only way that will, it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the, the year then doggone it that's what you should do.
M:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, I was just reading an article in, uh, a North Carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at, uh, letters of applications to universities.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	She was she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty, so, it can be done.
M:	Huh.
A:	Where there's a will,  where there's a will, there's a way, right?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, I have enjoyed talking to you.
