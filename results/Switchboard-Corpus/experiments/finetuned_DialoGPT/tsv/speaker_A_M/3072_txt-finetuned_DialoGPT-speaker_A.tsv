A:	Is that a nice vacation spot?
M:	Uh, I haven't been on a real hot, hot, cool, hot summer. I mean, I've been on, on a nice hot, mild summer.
A:	Right, okay.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Right. So you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
M:	Uh, no, because, uh
A:	Ooh, that would be nice.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Did you scuba dive there?
M:	Oh, yes, yes.
A:	Ooh, that would be nice.
M:	!!!% Yeah, that is, that's what we like to do. We've got a, we've got, uh, we have a little, uh little, little, well, little school on one side and a football field and, uh we've, we're kind of on a picnic table out there, so we, we do, uh
A:	Oh, that would be enjoyable. Right, yeah, that's, a nice break.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I haven't been on vacation in a while either. Um, usually when we go, we go to Colorado, to Estes Park area. Which is up kind of near Denver. And, uh, stay in the mountains up there, do a little hiking and resting, get away from the Texas heat, that kind of thing.
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-homing.
A:	So it's a lot of fun. I worked up there last summer, so I guess it was kind of like a vacation the, whole summer long
M:	Yeah.
A:	Worked at a camp there, and so I got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains. So that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.
M:	Oh.
A:	Oh.
M:	So, that is a new experience for them.
A:	That's nice. We, um, we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And that's the best place that I've ever canoed.
M:	Oh, that's really nice.
A:	It's really, really pretty. I was a little kid then, and we to have, uh, we stayed at some park and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night, and he would give a little talk about mountain things. You know, I think he wasn't a real mountain man, but we were pretty convinced he was a full, hermit who lived up in, the woods, that he'd come in his little log boat down the river,
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	and we would have to, we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and, That's a good family place to go,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening, but it wasn't, you know, too easy either.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It was like,
M:	Yeah.
A:	That's true.
M:	so.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	!!!!,!!et!! Remind me.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, so that, that, uh...
A:	Well, that's good. Well, we, um, let's see, the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.
M:	Uh-uh.
A:	And then I went to England a few years ago.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	I was a, student there and spent, um, a semester studying abroad in London.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place and it's, there's not a language barrier so you don't, I mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean, and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents, but it's, it was really fun. I, I, I really enjoyed that. I'm probably going back there to work, for a year.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It, it's really nice. I would, I would spend all my time in London, or most of my time,
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	and that's it was really different being in a big city, because I don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot
M:	!!!!,!!%!! Remind me of that, that, I used to do a lot more urban exploring when I was younger, and I didn't have to drive as far as I did now, because my car was so old,
A:	and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate, but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.
M:	Right.
A:	You could just kind of kind of walk around and observe,
M:	Right.
A:	I did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people.
M:	Oh, how neat.
A:	And I had a great time doing that. It was really interesting.
M:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, I know,
M:	and I would, I would love to go to the East Coast, you know, I love to travel,
A:	I keep wanting to get up to, I haven't, I haven't been anywhere else outside the United States. I haven't been to Mexico or Canada or,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh.
M:	and, uh, we lived there for a while, and then we moved to Dallas about a year and a half ago
A:	Yeah, that would be nice. I had a friend from there.
M:	Oh, yeah, and I, I would like to go to Spain.
A:	Then I, I'd love to go somewhere in Asia, but I'd have to have a tour guide with me to help with all the language and all that.
M:	Oh, that'd be neat.
A:	So, yeah, that's why, that's why England was nice. Even, we traveled in Europe for about a week, and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, most the places we went, we went to Germany and Switzerland and,
M:	Uh, I'm not sure if you have any children in the United States.
A:	Yeah, we have. We . We did, we whirlwinded through, Europe.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day, and you slept on the train at night.
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	But there wasn't a, it was strange, it was kind of sad, there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland, knew English.
M:	Uh-hau, uh-hue.
A:	So we were kind of pitiful. We found one restaurant we were in and got seated, and then no one knew English in there, and we were just finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But it was,
M:	Uh,
A:	Oh, I had fondue. That was easy to say
M:	Oh.
A:	Tried to get fondue and white wine, and that was,
M:	Okay. Uh, first of all, what type of painting do you do?
A:	we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly. There were some people at the next table who spoke English, so we elicited their aid for a while
M:	Oh.
A:	and, they were very helpful
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	so, It was, it was a pleasant time.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I'd, I'd love to go back there. There's just not time There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Right. That's
M:	Yeah.
A:	That and sleeping late
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I keep hoping for.
M:	Yeah, it's, it is a real problem. I'm not sure how long it's going to last, but, you know, we've got, we have got to have something.
A:	Well it was nice talking with you.
M:	Nice talking with, you too.
A:	And have a good afternoon.
M:	You too.
A:	Okay.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
A:	Good-bye.
M:	Bye-bye
