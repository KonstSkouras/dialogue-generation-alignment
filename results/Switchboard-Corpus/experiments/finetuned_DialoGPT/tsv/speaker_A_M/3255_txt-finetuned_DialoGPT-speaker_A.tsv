M:	Uh-huh.
A:	or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing, so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, I think the majority of the people do not carpool.
M:	Uh, that would be true.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh I think that, um
A:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Exactly.
M:	so they, they'll stay at home and do their own thing.
A:	Uh-huh, or if somebody gets sick. Yeah, or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person and they want to go home, and that one person's got the car then they're, they're stuck,
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	you're definitely right,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Sure, that happens quite a bit,
M:	and I think that's one of the major things that needs to happen.
A:	Yes, yeah
M:	But I donno, I guess I'm not for sure what our next step is.
A:	that's very true. Uh, other than that, uh, I don't know,
M:	I, I just, uh
A:	Okay.
M:	Okay, I guess we're on.
A:	Oh, okay, we'll try to be real quick here.
M:	Okay, well, it was nice talking to you.
A:	The other thing then is, because I don't know how long they want us to talk,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Five minutes, oh, okay.
M:	Okay, well, we're all ready.
A:	Minneapolis area,
M:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A:	Uh, actually no. We have, uh, quite a bit, uh, the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	you get some pollutants such as those, but those are natural
M:	Uh.
A:	um, but there is starting to, in Minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution, and they just put in a strict law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any, uh, lead into the air or other pollutants,
M:	Uh.
A:	and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,
M:	Yeah.
A:	at least where you .
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, yeah.
A:	Sure, yeah,
M:	and they've had it for a few years now.
A:	Yeah, it's not a bad idea. Uh-huh. Sure, sure,
M:	they're, they're still, uh
A:	Exactly,
M:	I don't know if they're going to do that in California, but, uh
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	and that's, that's a, that, that would be a huge step in the right direction.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, she can't, she doesn't like the, uh the Styrofoam, the, the the, you know the, all the styrofoams,
A:	Sure.
M:	but they can, they know they're getting the message.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure.
M:	so.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Sure
M:	!!!%!!;!!!,!!That!!I!!You!!Have!! translated!!This!!They!!We!!?!! LINE!! Auto!! Remind!! This!!Thank!!
A:	uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, I'm sure over there it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	but it's uncomfortable
M:	Right.
A:	but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done, and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the, uh, into the air because he opened it,
M:	Uh, uh-hous.
A:	and, I don't know if there was something wrong with it, or it, his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and I was thinking how many other people
M:	Yeah.
A:	oh, sure, because if you take it into a service station, they want to charge you forty dollars just for, uh, freon, which only costs you about three dollars
M:	Right.
A:	so I have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, Hey, that's that's right there.
M:	Right.
A:	I think it's like three or four dollars a, a can
M:	Uh, that is not bad at all.
A:	and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car, and I, I thought about that, and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because I'm sure he breathed it
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that
M:	Yeah, I think,
A:	Exactly.
