M:	What part?
A:	Um, the South Hills area, Beaver County, well originally Beaver County .
M:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, where are you from?
M:	I'm from, uh, I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.
A:	Oh, okay, I know where that is.
M:	Yeah, it's, it was, it had a lot of trees there, and, uh.
A:	Yeah, that's pretty out there. What, well,
M:	We're just north of, uh, Washington State.
A:	Oh, okay, yeah, I got my brother and my whole family there. I'm, I'm talking to you from Dallas right now.
M:	Oh really, okay.
A:	Uh-huh
M:	Oh.
A:	No, my husband does.
M:	Uh, okay.
A:	And who, how about you?
M:	Well, we're, we, we have a daughter who's a sophomore at U T and a daughter that's a senior at U C L A.
A:	place that, that needed this. *listen--not sure who's saying what
M:	Right, right.
A:	Well that's okay. I guess it's an easy thing to do. So you're you have a big, do you have a rural house or what do you have?
M:	Uh, well, I have a town home, but it's not a very large one. Uh, I, I guess I do have a small town home.
A:	Oh, that's a, Those are beautiful.
M:	Yeah, it's a four story.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But we've had, uh, a lot of problems with, uh with, with the, uh the, with, you, I don't know, the, the molding, uh
A:	Yeah, is it a, is it a working farm or is it?
M:	It, it's a working, uh, farm house.
A:	More, more, I can understand that, that's probably what I would, uh,
M:	Uh-uh. I think we're going to have to do something, though, because I just don't think we can afford it.
A:	Yeah
M:	I'm in the process of, uh
A:	I can hear the accent now I hear the I hear the Western Pennsylvania, um.
M:	Oh, yeah, I've, I, I grew up in western Pennsylvania,
A:	We live, uh, we lived in Minneapolis for about five years.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	We, we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married
M:	Uh.
A:	and then, um, actually married in Pittsburgh, and that's, that's not what they want to hear on this call, uh
M:	Oh, really?
A:	at any rate we came back here with, my husband was transferred around, uh, up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T I
M:	Uh.
A:	and we're leasing a, uh, two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And it's, uh, near a little town called Plano, well, it's not little any more.
M:	Uh, that's right.
A:	Uh, yes, that's out near the airport. That's about forty-five miles from us.
M:	That's a long ways.
A:	It's, yeah, That's why we not sure, we, we're not sure we want to, uh, buy down here, because we actually, we lived up north long enough to appreciate the, um, *listen--one utt? Minneapolis-Saint Paul is very clean
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know, in terms of, *listen; with previous slash unit? and in terms of housing down here, um, you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy.
M:	Uh, well, I, I agree with you. I, uh I think that, uh
A:	It really is, I mean we're, we're in a leased town home, and it's, uh, you're probably, your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking, it's nine hundred a month.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	But, you know what, if you, if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living you know, the big apartment complexes
M:	Yeah.
A:	and, and I just have no tolerance for that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	No.
M:	but, uh, I don't know, I think, uh
A:	Yeah this is, it's like a duplex, like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's nice but it's, I mean, the girl bought it for a hundred and ten, and now she can't sell it. And our neighbors,
M:	Uh-hau.
A:	Yeah, I mean, we'll, our neighbors, the attached on the other side, they're very nice, thank God,
M:	Yeah.
A:	they paid fifty-eight for it.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	That's how bad it, I know.
M:	Yeah, yeah, well, I don't know. I donno, I, I just, I guess I donate to the, the, uh, the school system, and I, and, and the, and it's, it's just been so poorly run, and and, uh.
A:	That's right. Uh-huh, yeah. I have some friends that live in Westport and it's really, really bad. I mean you,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's a good house.
A:	How far, where is Clarion County in relation to, actually, because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania
M:	Uh, well, Clarion is about an hour and a half away.
A:	That's not too bad. That's north.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Are you going up toward, uh, uh, I'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M, Bradford, no that's too far north.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	So you're, you're not that far north then, okay.
M:	Yeah, it is. It's about twenty miles north of, uh, Washington D C.
A:	Well, you're really not too bad. Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! remindMe!%
A:	Um, was it a home that you've had for quite a few years, or that you've,
M:	No. It was, uh, a home where my mother was living at the time.
A:	Oh, then you have, yeah. Do you have a lot of land or,
M:	Yeah, we have a, uh, well, we're close to a lake, so we have quite a lot.
A:	Oh, my, well, then.
M:	Yeah, but we have, we do have a garden here.
A:	There you go. Did you have a hard time getting used to, do you feel like you live in an isolated area or,
M:	Well, I, I live in a small town.
A:	Yeah, I think that that's, um, I can remember in Pittsburgh when, this has to do with homes, uh, indirectly but I can remember when Upper Saint Clair was out in the, you know, the rural end of Washington,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and now it's it's a terrible connection.
M:	Uh, yeah, I, I don't know, it's, it, it just seems like, like I donno, I'm, I grew up in the south, and I think it's mostly, you, you have more of a southern draw, and a southern accent, and you don't hear anybody outside of your immediate family.
A:	Oh, well that's okay, um,
M:	So,
A:	But, but, yeah, substantially, you know. Um, do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that?
M:	!!!%!! Remind me that's a real good idea.
A:	How big is it? How many square feet do you have?
M:	It's about a square foot and, and, uh, it's, it, it has the, uh the, the nice big three rooms and,
A:	Well how many rooms do you think, yeah?
M:	I don't know, I don't think I could fit everything in.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we have one on the other side of the den, and, uh we have a den that's completely filled with other people's stuff, and I think that's the only thing that we really have trouble with is the bedrooms because, you know, it's not really a den but a, it kind of like a, a, you're not really supposed to be looking at the bedrooms, you just want to be there to be entertained,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And then we have an outside area that we put up, and we put a, a pool, and then we put another one up. And then we're supposed to go swimming, but it's, it's not enclosed, so we have to shut it off.
A:	A junk room, yeah I understand, we have that too. That's, that's large if your children aren't at home any more.
M:	Yeah, well, mine are, and they, and I've got two other children, so they're both grown and I don't have a lot of spare time either.
A:	That's large if your kids aren't at home any more.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, that, that is, that can be, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	we've got a couple of houses around our neighborhood that are really nice, and the one I'm in, it doesn't have a basement.
A:	It's enough space for two people Yeah.
M:	Yeah, I'm, I like that idea.
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	So, I don't know, I guess that's, I think that's a, a, that's an advantage of having a smaller house, I mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be bigger, it's just the fact that it's close enough to the house to the school.
A:	Yeah, right. That's okay. Well, we've got, um, this town house is pretty big. It's about eighteen hundred square feet. It's got three bedrooms, two and a half baths
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	um, it's really nice.
M:	Wow.
A:	Yeah, it is, I mean, I would never buy it but leasing it is fine.
M:	Oh, is that right?
A:	Um, but, it's just again, the, the privacy, you know. Um, we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres, and my husband was raised, um, on a working farm near
M:	Uh.
A:	right, near Dayton, Ohio, and he said, you know, he's, he's slowly getting me to, um, not feel isolated if we move to where there's more land.
M:	Oh.
A:	Right.
M:	but, uh, I, I don't know, I just, I really don't have any, any strong feelings one way or the other about it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	That's kind of what, like his parents have, uh, land that they retired to, um, about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and, in Georgia,
M:	Uh.
A:	and it is too far south for me,
M:	Um.
A:	but, um, um, but I mean, they have one of the, um, when they said log cabin, I just laughed, that they retired to, but they built one of these. I mean, it's just beautiful. It's like a custom, you know it's not like what I would think of when I think of old log cabins. You know, I mean, it's modern it's,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Right, right, it's modern, it's beautiful, it's country
M:	Yeah.
A:	it's you know, um, but, uh, I don't, what else about housing except it's, uh, well, Pittsburgh's housing economy, I think it's holding it's own.
M:	Yeah, well they, they're building a new stadium downtown, and they're going to, uh.
A:	What part, what sections are they in? Yeah, that's nice.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
A:	Great.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! Remind me of that one.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But it's still, it's, it still works fine.
A:	Uh-huh. That's, yeah, a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills, and they've been in their house, oh, probably about twelve years now
M:	Uh.
A:	and, um, it's, it's, you know, they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon.
M:	Oh, I would think so.
A:	Um, but it's a beautiful home and, I mean, my brother lives,
M:	Uh, how about you?
A:	is it called Baldwin or Bebble?
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	I mean, he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon, um, it's real pretty up there. It's just,
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	And the neighborhoods are stable you know.
M:	Uh, so, so you're just out of the loop.
A:	It's, uh, when you come to this part of the country, we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, my goodness.
M:	and so we, we were away for a while, and then we came back, and now we live in an apartment, and I'm away for another two months.
A:	Uh-huh. That's what it is here, yeah, that's why we're at a point now we've, uh, we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is, uh, you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in Yeah,
M:	Uh, that is a, a big jump.
A:	that's kind of like where we're,
M:	And it's just kind of,
A:	so we're considering Pennsylvania, and we're just kind of, you know, toying with what exactly, where we want to be, you know.
M:	Right.
A:	A lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and, but I disagree with that, I.
M:	!!!%!!;!!etwork!! Remind me of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's, it's just a, it is a nightmare.
A:	I know, and it, and the economy here in Dallas, I mean, it, it's steady, but it's still not going up.
M:	Well, I know, I, I think that's, uh, I don't know, it just seems like, uh you know, the, the only thing that's going on here, it seems like it seems, it really is a problem, you know.
A:	And I, um, I just refuse to buy it, um, if I know I'm not going to be there for at least five years, uh, you, you know.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, I'm sure, yeah, there, I mean, you can go down a street, and here, he told you this, every other house, you know, if it's been foreclosed on or, you know, even big executives
M:	Uh, uh-hum.
A:	um, it's really, I mean, and, and it's hard to sell the properties. People from J C Penney's from New York, came here about a couple of years ago.
M:	Yeah, it sounds like you've got it under control, then.
A:	And they thought they were getting a great deal, um, because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with, they call it, zero lot lines, no property, And it would make you ill to see this.
M:	Right.
A:	I mean it would probably be like your house on, uh, you know, a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Yeah, I know, and that's, you know, like I can look outside right now and look into the next unit.
M:	Uh-hope, yeah.
A:	You know, it's across the way, and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas,
M:	Uh.
A:	but it's still, it's still not that private.
M:	Yeah, yeah, it, it is.
A:	Yeah but you have a rider.
M:	And you have to let him get away from you, but otherwise he's good.
A:	No, and your kids have, to tell you the truth, um, I think that if you can keep that, that way, you know, kind of like a homestead,
