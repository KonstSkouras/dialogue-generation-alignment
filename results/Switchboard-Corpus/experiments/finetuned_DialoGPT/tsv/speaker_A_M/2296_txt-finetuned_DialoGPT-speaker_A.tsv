A:	Uh, very good.
M:	and so I try and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	Um, I do, I have, uh, one son who's a sophomore in high school.
A:	Yeah, there are, there are lots of bike paths. I know, my son is a biker and he, he's done the whole canal, I think it's a hundred and eighty miles, with the scouts.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	And so, but that somehow takes, organization. For me, it's much easier just the stationary bike, you know, it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading,
M:	Uh.
A:	Um, but,
M:	Well, I've never done that before.
A:	No, I live in Maryland.
M:	Oh, you do?
A:	Right, right, and that's it, um, at work we have a, a nice campus,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops so I do. Now, I think, um, basically, is your motive simply, um, health or because you enjoy it?
M:	Well, because, um. Well, I like exercise, I enjoy it, but I, I don't like to go out and do it. I, uh, I have a problem with it, I, you know, I can't handle it any more.
A:	Uh-huh, right. I think pretty much you summed up my, my, my motivations also.
M:	Yes, it is.
A:	Oh, well, that's great, that's great.
M:	So, I'm, I've been doing a lot of, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but then after that it starts, it starts to build up again.
A:	Right. And actually in, in summer I like to swim. We don't have facilities for swimming in winter, but, um, and, and that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake, I'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening.
M:	Uh, that is good.
A:	So.
M:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	No, I'm not.

A:	No.
M:	Okay, I don't know if you're familiar with Philadelphia, but
A:	Oh, really.
M:	Yeah, I don't know what the other one is.
A:	No, I don't know that. But, I, I must say, that, um, when, when I did do a linguistics course in, in school, ages ago, um, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California, and at that point that was sort of the limit but since then I've been abroad a lot,
M:	Huh-uh.
A:	In Santa Barbara.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Well, very good, I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	and, uh, it was nice talking to you.
M:	!!!% Well, it's been nice talking with you. I appreciate it.
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	Bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye.
