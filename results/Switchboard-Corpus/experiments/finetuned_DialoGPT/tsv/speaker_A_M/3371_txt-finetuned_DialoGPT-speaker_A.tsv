M:	I mean, I guess you'd consider that a home.
A:	We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four hundred.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Uh, we've got five bedrooms, because we built onto our garage.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	A, a bedroom for my mother, and, uh,
M:	Uh-homing type.
A:	Oh.
M:	I mean, it was just, I mean, just the whole thing was like that.
A:	Oh, that's great.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Well, this, this house is very comfortable. We've got two living areas and that, that's the thing I probably like the most about it.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It's just one story. Yeah. It's a Fox and Jacobs home.
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	Um, we've been real happy with it.
M:	Oh, that is nice.
A:	Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that. They could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight and this is under something but,
M:	No, no, it's not.
A:	No.
M:	No, it doesn tamp you down any more.
A:	No, we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.
M:	Well, I guess we're on, then.
A:	No.
M:	Oh, that's a problem too, that you have to fix.
A:	We've been real lucky. So,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	so.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	It's nice to have them, but, you know, I just miss them.
A:	Yeah, I, I've heard a lot of people say that. That's for sure. Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood over the beams and things up in the attic and so that, has replaced it to some extent
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	but certainly not,
M:	I know that's true.
A:	Uh, in parts. I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it for a room.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yes.
M:	But it's, it's not, it has a lot more support on it than it did in the old days.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, we, uh, we've got, you know, I'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Two living areas. We have a living room and dining room at the front of the house,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and playroom at the rear of the house which has been really nice.
M:	Uh, how many people usually come to the house?
A:	In fact, I really enjoy the playroom that, you would think that would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house, but of all the rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been really nice to have
M:	Yeah.
A:	I think that's true.
M:	You know, I, I have a problem with that. I think they need to spend more time on the children.
A:	Yeah. Probably our family room is the, the biggest. Uh,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me. That's funny.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And we have a private bathroom, and we have to clean it, you know, every night.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's just, I don't know.
A:	Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment.
M:	Uh, I know. I, I, uh-hope so much about that, that you can do.
A:	So
M:	Yeah, we, we just, uh.
A:	Seventeen years.
M:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Oh, wow.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	You know, it's all metric.
A:	Yes, it is.
M:	Is it?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you know, it's, it was a lot of fun.
A:	Well, that's interesting.
M:	And, uh, I've, I have done that also. And, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh, and it's got a lot to do with the weather too.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway. That's his, that's his,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	worst thing in life is to have to repair something.
M:	Oh, yeah, well, he was a mechanic and, and the only time he ever had to do anything was when he was fixing the alternator, the starter.
A:	So,
M:	Well, I don't know.
A:	Well, uh, that's great. We just kind of save everything for when Al , uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit and then he does all the repairing, you know, he does
M:	Yeah.
