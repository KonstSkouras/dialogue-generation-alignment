M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really made me feel good.
M:	Uh.
A:	Got out a lot of aggression. I went to the gym every day and I ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good. I needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time. Now when I do those things, they're boring. I would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place.
M:	Uh, I, I don't know, I've never run in the mall. I've always run in a park. I mean, I have a bicycle, but I don 'ever get into it.
A:	And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago. And I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good. I love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that, I really like that a lot.
M:	I don't know if you've ever been to the jazzercise class here in Plano.
A:	It is, it's aerobics but it's with dance steps.
M:	!!!et!!;!!body!! They're just, they don't, they can't get enough of the exercise from the dance step, but, uh they, they do build you up and build you back up and they do the rest.
A:	It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight. And it's just, uh, it's a lot of fun.
M:	What, what, what kind of music do you like to do?
A:	and I'm, I'm getting much better. My stamina is getting great for the dance floor so  I mean it's just,
M:	!!!% Well, that's great.
A:	there's a lot of positive things with it, so.
M:	!!!%
A:	It is inside and I've  been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I just enjoy that much more too than inside.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice. We get to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does her homework.
M:	Yeah.
A:	So I've enjoyed that part of it. Yeah. And at the gym, even in the class, uh, I, it's not really a group where you chat a lot. Everybody's on their way to someplace
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and so, you know, I do  have one friend who goes occasionally
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so.
M:	Yeah.
A:	There are, there are. It's more motivating that way, I think. Yeah.
M:	Because it's like, it's, it really is.
A:	You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V but you probably wouldn't.
M:	No, I've never, I don't think I could do that
A:	So.
M:	Well, I, I've enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, yeah, I can see it'll be a good break.
M:	Well, I hope so.
A:	Right.
M:	and, uh  I, uh.
A:	Uh-huh
M:	and so, I think that's good, too.
A:	I think you do. You feel very good after you exercise. I think  it's worth making the time for yourself.
M:	Uh, yeah. I, uh  I have a friend who's a, uh a, a nurse and she has to take her little girl to, uh to, to,
A:	You owe it to yourself
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	and I think you do accomplish more after that.
M:	That's right.
A:	And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, I think it's well worth it. I just demand that time for myself. Now I've learned to do that
M:	Yeah, I, I do the same thing.
A:	and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around. So.
M:	Well, I'm, I, I know that, uh
A:	You have to. Because   there's always more things to do.
M:	I think it would be nice if we could get more people involved in the work force,
A:	There is always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I don't demand a lot for myself and so you know, I just feel entitled to it
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I take it so.
M:	Well, it's just, you know it's, it is just a, it just is a problem.
A:	No, I've done some walking with friends in the past.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do exercise
M:	Yeah.
A:	and that's not really beneficial, so, uh I don't have time like that
M:	Yeah, well, that's good.
A:	and I spend enough time chatting around everywhere, you know
