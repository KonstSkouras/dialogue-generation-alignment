M:	Well, you're not going to have to worry too much about that, because, uh.
A:	Some buildings do, it depends on the location. The area I live in right now, is, is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all, no burglar alarms, no guards.
M:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's just, it just seems like there's just a lot more of the, the people, more of them, you get a lot,
A:	Uh-huh. Um.
M:	but they're still, they're trying to fill the gap.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, you know, you hear about people selling their babies to support their family, you don't hear about kids being involved in drug crimes, you mean?
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	I don't think that's a good thing.
A:	Uh-huh. There's a lot of that going on in Dallas, too.
M:	Yeah, it's, it is scary.
A:	Yeah, it's really sad.
M:	It is, it is.
A:	Uh-huh, Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, I don, I, I think that, that, uh you know I think it's important to have children.
A:	Oh, I agree. I think that people are getting off too easy. They're getting, they're getting paroled too easily.
M:	Well, I,
A:	They're just getting, uh, put on probation or something, because the prisons don't have enough room so they get, they get lighter sentences,
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	and some of those people, they don't deserve to be let loose.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	So, you could tell they had gotten away from the real world and were living in a real world, you knew.
A:	Oh my gosh.
M:	Uh, and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I guess, you know, you, you don't want to say, you want to, you can't say that they were in there for life, but they were certainly not for saving the country.
A:	Uh, that's terrible.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I think that's a big problem.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and I don't know what the answer is.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and so the person that's committing the crime is going, well, I mean I think they should be punished,
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's like, uh, you see the same thing happen with the kids, you're like, well, you got to do something to get them to do.
A:	Right, it's a little more understandable under the circumstances, I guess.
M:	Uh-uh. But, I, I think, I mean, you just have to take what they say at face value, you're not going to get anything out of it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And I don, I don's that, that's, that would be fair, but I think the, the problem is that, um, you know, the, uh the, I, I really don't see the problem with it. I, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I think, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, you know, that's a big problem. I don't know, I think there's so much wrong with the system, um, you, you have people who are, who are abusing the systems and who are committing crimes that, you can't, you don't want them out of society for any length of time.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, so, you know, I think that's, I'm not sure that's right.
A:	Right, we have enough, enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is. So let, let their country take care of it.
M:	Yeah, well, we, we're not doing that. We're, we are trying to, uh, uh, I don't know, to make it, uh
A:	We don't have, I guess too much trouble in Dallas with, well, I guess, I guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico, that cause problems, but, uh.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh-hue, I think that's probably the most common example, and I think, uh that's the most prevalent problem.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I don, I'm not sure that they're as, as close as we might have with the domestic political situation.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And they're still raping people and killing people and, you can't even imagine that.
A:	Uh-huh. It was amazing I went to the Far East, uh, back in October to do some training for T I and I,
M:	Uh,
A:	uh, some of those countries were so safe, it was unreal. Singapore is very, supposed to be very safe and, in fact, Tokyo, and I thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but they, at, at the T I there, I said is there any area I should avoid. And the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl, and said, can you think of any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself, or anything. And she, she thought for a few minutes and she said, no. And he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself. She said, no. And they said, it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
M:	Uh.
A:	and somebody will turn it in and, and nothing will be missing. They said they can just about guarantee that there, that, that would happen if you did that. I thought, boy, in America, if you left a purse on a subway, you would never see it again.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Yeah, that's true,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
A:	that's true. But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, I couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place. They said, the, apparently the crime, is, just, uh,
M:	Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, that, that just doesn't make sense to me either.
A:	I'm not sure what it is there. Now, I know what it is in Singapore, is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	like for drugs, for drugs they, they enforce the death penalty for that. Uh, they're just, very, very tough, and I guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too, or Japan is too. They're just very tough on criminals.
M:	Yeah, well I, you know, I don't know if I agree with that or not.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't think we have the right system to do it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, oh yeah.
M:	And they put them in there for twenty years and they're still going on.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Like I said, I, I really don't have any problem with it. Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I mean, I, I don't know.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, I think there are certain crimes that are, that are beyond, uh uh, rehabilitation.
A:	Right, and if they're overcrowded, well, you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and you can't say, well you know you're sorry, and then you can go back and say, you did something wrong and you're not guilty, you're, you can still be tried again, and you can be tried for the same crime again,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, uh  you know  it's just,  I don't know.
A:	Oh, yeah, I agree, because it's not fair to those of us that, that deserve a safe, you know, life to have to,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Right.
M:	If you're going, you're not going to get out as much as you would if you were on probation.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they, they just, they don't care.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, and so I think they're thinking, well, you know, you, you've got to have a deterrent, and we've got a lot of people that are breeding them so that, uh, they can't get out of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I don't know if we've ever had a, a real good example but, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But I think, I think they're really going to have to, I, I don't know, I just, I'm beginning to think that, that, um, that a lot of people are just not real informed about what, what's going on.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	and he just, he just got caught.
A:	Right, not much.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, huh-uh, and especially not in some of these big cities, like in Dallas I mean they've had, they're up in the top, top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed on, on, in the line of duty and that's really sad.
M:	Well, I think that's a, that's not a good thing, I mean, I don't think it's a good idea at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I mean it's, it's just, you know, I don't know, it just seems like, you just don't, you don't want to over kill somebody just because they're black or you know
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
