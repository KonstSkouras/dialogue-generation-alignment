M:	I mean, I wouldn't want anybody to think of me that had a problem with their car or their, uh family or anything like that, but, uh.
A:	What, uh, is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?
M:	Um, uh-hope. Um, I'm not sure exactly what the, the problem is. I guess it's, uh
A:	Uh-huh. Do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?
M:	Um, no. I'm in a townhouse.
A:	How far out from the city, I mean, do you,

A:	About fifteen miles. I live in a little suburb, uh, which is, I guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so
M:	Uh-uh.
A:	but it's pretty congested. We are considered in the country,
M:	Uh.
A:	but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country.
M:	Um, well, that's, that, that is a problem too, uh-homing, uh.
A:	Our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies and very few instances of, you know, alcohol, drugs, uh, reported.
M:	!!!%
A:	However, I'm sure they're there.
M:	Yeah, I know they are.
A:	But, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed, sometime during their, their, uh, existence in that neighborhood.
M:	Oh, goodness.
A:	And since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms uh, and including the out, uh, the outer perimeter type, uh, devices, sensors and things like that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It's cut back, you know, considerably, but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood, so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, I would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Most,
M:	Well, I'm not sure. I don't know what, what percentage of the voters actually turn out to vote. I, I, we're supposed to be talking about people who turn out at lunch time to vote in the evening.
A:	Well, most families, most families are young and both people are working.
M:	Oh, uh-hoh.
A:	So they're happening during the hours they're gone from work.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, so, uh, I would say that's probably their prime motivation. They'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, they classify most of them as professionals.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick.
M:	Right.
A:	Probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles, the, you know, Mercedes, Volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets,
M:	Uh.
A:	guns, that sort of stuff.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff.
M:	Uh, I see.
A:	Well, uh, the police force, for one, I think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use. Uh, it's, oh, right now I think, we are about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty, for that amount of people which is not very many.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And,
M:	And the problem with that is that, uh you know when you get into the, the drug culture, the people are selling it to the highest bidder.
A:	Well, the, course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever, so they're giving the early release, uh,
M:	Uh,
A:	Yeah, and, and it's, I think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh, but for the,
M:	Okay, I, I can start off at this point. Uh, I guess, I'd like to say that, uh uh, the problems with capital punishment in the United States are that, that, you know, it's so easy to kill somebody simply because they're, you're, they're a violent person.
A:	That would be, certainly be a deterrent.
M:	I mean, I don't know, it, it seems like it would be so, so stupid that you wouldn't do something.
A:	And, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires. You know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate. Uh,
M:	Uh, that's true.
A:	Uh, I think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases. Course, I, I know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof.
M:	Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean I, uh.
A:	Uh,
M:	But you can be completely innocent in some cases.
A:	I'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence, uh, to convict somebody
M:	Right, I agree.
A:	and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes, uh, to reach the life sentences and, you know, death penalties and follow-through with that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder
M:	Right.
A:	uh, I know in my case, I, my wife and daughter were kidnapped, during a house robbery back in eighty-five
M:	Oh, my.
A:	and we caught, the individuals got caught, we, uh, we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh you know, the, the forty-five to the head, you know, just the, the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh, you know, the guy only got five years.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system. So what, what,
M:	Yeah, well, that's, that, that is true. I, I don't know if that, I mean, I, uh.
A:	Do what now?
M:	Okay.
A:	no. I'm not real familiar with that.
M:	I was going to say, we got a guy from Maryland who did that to our son's volleyball net and he got, he got three point seven.
A:	Oh.
M:	but, you know, it's not, it wouldn't be legal,
A:	Well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job, he has nothing, there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah. Uh, very
M:	You know, that, I mean, I don't know, it's, it just seems like it's so, you can't say, you just can't do it, you don't have the authority, you, you have the, the authority to do it.
A:	Yeah. They don't do that here. Course they pay them, but they don't, you don't, you or the insurance companies never see any of that money.
M:	No, they don tinker with that. That's, that's the whole thing. And, and they don, they put, uh they put in a lot of, uh a lot more money for, for, uh their causes.
A:	And, uh, you know, and they're right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders, they, uh, been in jail before
M:	Yeah
A:	they've been released, you know, several times, which is another, uh, deal I hate to see.
M:	Uh, and you know the, the other thing that I hate about the news, you hear so much about the number of violent crimes that are committed, you, you say, you're glad that there are, you said there are more than one person, you are glad that somebody is doing that crime, but you wonder how many times have you heard of people being killed or, you have you seen these, uh
A:	But, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh, and car theft on top of it, destroys my car,
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars and, you know, the guy gets out in two months
M:	Yeah.
A:	and he goes out and commits it again. Fact, he's back in jail now. So, what, what, uh,
M:	What's the latest crime you've seen?
A:	Yeah. What, what deterrent does he really have?
M:	Well, you, you don't hear, you hear too much on the news about him being out and about, you think, well, he may have just been out of the country for a while, and, and that he's doing something to try to get back in the neighborhood.
A:	Yeah, I think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people
M:	Uh.
A:	and, uh, return offenders have, they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood, they'll rob one house, then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands.
M:	Oh.
A:	Course it doesn't always work out in their favor.
M:	No.
A:	But, uh, nevertheless, I think people are just getting fed up and saying, you know, you can't arrest all of us,
M:	That's true.
A:	you can, you know, you can get some of us,
M:	Yeah.
A:	you can't get all of us.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but the people that are going to steal from you, that are in the house, they're going to kill somebody else,
A:	Yeah, that's, I mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, it helps for a while
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!;!! FUNNIEST!! LINE!!I!!You!!you!!Okay!!Well!!Nice!! You!!That!!Yeah!!One!!one!!And!!Hi!!We!!Have!!This!!?!! remind!!It!!All!!What!!Did!! This!!How!!xt!! Auto!!sv!!
A:	but then just another different set of people come in, and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state.
M:	Yeah, I, I think that, uh.
A:	Uh, I would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in Oklahoma, and Louisiana, Arkansas, you know, across the, the border.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
M:	Right.
A:	it's not many from the local communities.
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
A:	But, uh, it's a problem, and I, I just, I think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,
M:	Uh,
A:	would be a definite deterrent and, and, uh, giving the, uh, police, uh, agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they, when they catch these people.
M:	Yeah, I,
A:	Right.
M:	And I, that's what I think should happen is if, if they have the money to pay for it, then they should have the right to, to enforce it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	if they're, if they're a habitual user of any kind of drugs, they can lose their driver's license.
A:	I know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal.
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	They, they went to all, all ...
