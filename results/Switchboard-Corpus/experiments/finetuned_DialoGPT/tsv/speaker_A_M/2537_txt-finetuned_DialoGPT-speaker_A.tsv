M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but I don't really like having to do it. It,
M:	Well, I think, uh.
A:	And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Yeah, yeah, I think so too. But, you know, it's one of those things.
M:	Well, I guess we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh
A:	Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever.
M:	Yeah, I, I agree with you there.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, I don't know, I, I just, I really don't see, uh.
A:	Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
M:	I think that would be fair. I think that the random testing would be good to, to check for drugs.
A:	Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can,  stay off of it.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know, they just kind of say, well, we'll just let you go.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, you're, you, you have to be a certain income holder before you can get benefits.
A:	I think so too, uh, I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, boy, they just really, you know let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently
M:	!!!%!!You bet!!
A:	but, uh, it has quieted down, but I don't think they probably feel any differently,
M:	Yeah. I, I think, I, uh
A:	and some, some of them did quit the company.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	True.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	you know, and, and that's one thing, that's, that, you're not allowed to advertise your benefits. You know, you can't say, you, you do this for a cause, you don't have to do this, you just have to say, I want this.
A:	Yeah, I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	don't tell me what to do, you know.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, you don't want to believe everything you hear on the news, but I think that's a lot of what the media does.
A:	Yeah. Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. But I think it's too minor and too, you know,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I don't know.
A:	Well, yes.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
A:	That, yes. I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't,
M:	Right.
A:	you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
M:	Right, exactly.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, you, I mean, it's, it, it can be dangerous, you're not going to go to jail for it, but you can't just shoot somebody because you know you got a gun.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, it's, it, it really is, you have to wonder, you've got to wonder if, if, you, if the, you're really, if they're really trying to do a good job, or if they really, you really don't want to pay taxes on it, you just have to pay it.
A:	Right. No.
M:	so I don't know,
A:	I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.
M:	Right.
A:	You know, that's, that's totally out.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	so, I don't know, it's, it may be the government's fault, but, uh.
A:	Oh, that's interesting.
M:	So, uh
A:	Well, I guess we've exhausted that one.
M:	Yes, I think so, yes.
A:	enjoyed talking to you.
M:	and I enjoyed talking to, and I, I hope I'm going to have a good visit with my grandchildren this year so,
A:	Good-bye.
M:	Bye.
