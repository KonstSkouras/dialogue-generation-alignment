A:	Right, as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love. They just give it, and don't expect too much.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Anyway, do you have a pet?
M:	Yes, I do.
A:	Oh! like a
M:	Uh, it was a cat and it was, it, it hit the car right in the middle of me, and I just couldn't believe it.
A:	Oh, I'm so sorry. But that's good that you're going to get another one.
M:	Well, it was, it really was.
A:	I know some of my friends who have pets, uh, and they just are really, you know, the ones that have dogs are very, uh, protective of them and I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets. But they just, um, really take care of them, or, uh, are protective of them.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, an, and my, my kids,
M:	So that's kind,
A:	um, they really want a dog badly, and they've been looking and looking and want, you know, they'd take anything I think
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but, um, I don't know do you like, I guess your cat was an indoor cat.
M:	Uh, yeah,
A:	It kind of traveled around travel .
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, when I had a Cocker Spaniel it, it was an outdoor dog and, uh, I think I liked that better.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	I mean, I mean, they're, they, they take up so much space in the house, and I,
A:	Yeah, that's true. Take them for walks, right. Yeah, I see all the people on, on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and, and I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog, I'm like I know it will be fun the first week maybe,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and then mom gets to take care of it, or something. So, I
M:	Yeah that's, that, that would be nice.
A:	Oh, that's exciting. Yeah.
M:	so I was kind of looking for something a little more, uh, challenging,
A:	Yeah, I think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that, you know, we're not just going on with this pet population and having to, just get rid of them.
M:	Well, that, uh  that's a big part of it.
A:	That, that kind of gripes on me some, but, but I don't know.
M:	I think, uh.
A:	More and more people are, Right, right.
M:	and that's a, that's the way it's going to be.
A:	But, uh,
M:	I think it's a wonderful thing, though.
A:	I think that's really true.
M:	I, I think that was one of the things that I, I was really interested in when I was younger, was in pet raising.
A:	Yeah.
M:	you don't have to worry about them being thrown in the dumpster, you just have to deal with it.
A:	Yeah, exactly.
M:	So, I don't know, it's, it seems like there's a lot of things that need to be done about, uh, recycling.
A:	Exactly. I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too, and, and that's good too.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, I think that's all I have to say.
M:	Okay, well, thank you.
A:	Okay, have a good night. All right, bye-bye.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
