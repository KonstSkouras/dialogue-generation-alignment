M:	And then, uh we went, uh to the, uh, closer to Oahu and then to, uh the, closer to the wharf, uh  the wharimar, uh uh, the whalming, uh
A:	Oh that's, wow. Yeah.
M:	And then, we went up to the, uh the, closer to Maui, and then we went over to the coast.
A:	Oh I've I've been lots of places. My last vacation was actually in Morocco I guess we, that one would count ,
M:	Oh, I went to Europe.
A:	Uh, that was about a year and a half ago, and,
M:	Oh, that's cool.
A:	Uh, well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time
M:	Oh, uh-huh.
A:	and we decided that I, I've never been to Africa and I needed to get that continent since I hadn't been there yet. And it, it's, actually it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go and they speak French and, so, uh, you know, in that sense is just a little bit easier
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go. And, So we, we didn't really have enough time.
M:	Yeah.
A:	We had about, a little bit less than two weeks.
M:	Uh, uh-hope.
A:	And as always, it it seems a bit, uh, rushed. We do a lot of traveling around. We rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere.
M:	Well, that's great.
A:	No, in fact some of the days we froze. It was,
M:	Oh.
A:	well we were there in the winter. In uh, January or February, I don't remember which,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	At at, excuse me, at what age did you, Oh, that's too bad because,
M:	And I had a lot of friends that went to, uh you know the, uh to like the Girl Scouts and things like that.
A:	Uh-huh
M:	and, uh,
A:	Yeah. It was a very interesting vacation. The only thing I didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh, um, the, it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide
M:	Uh.
A:	and you, there were some places, where people,
M:	Uh,
A:	there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,
M:	Uh,
A:	and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in, you know, in jacket underneath a coat type of thing.
M:	Oh.
A:	But,
M:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we would go into the grocery store and try to sell it to them, and they would say, well, you can't do that, you have to go through this whole procedure, you must go through the whole procedure.
A:	Yeah.

A:	The, the worst place was in Marrakech
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
M:	Uh.
A:	it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you.
M:	Right.
A:	And it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
M:	Uh. Uh-hum.
A:	and you feel stupid doing that but we did it,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and we were much happier,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone, uh,
M:	Right.
A:	Uh
M:	Uh, well, I've been to Europe twice.
A:	Yes.
M:	and you have a lot of friends there.
A:	No actually I haven't been all through Europe,  like I haven't been to Italy yet.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Uh, we're going to go for a conference in September and so, hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.
M:	Oh, that's nice.
A:	Uh, my more exciting spots have been, I've been to the Galapagos Islands.
M:	Oh, that's, that sounds neat.
A:	Uh-huh, that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.
M:	Oh, that's, that sounds wonderful.
A:	Yes. If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.
M:	Oh, I love it.
A:	If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest But it, that was really, really fabulous and just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,
M:	Uh.
A:	Um, August, eighty-eight.
M:	Oh, that's, that sounds,
A:	And then, actually, after there I went to um, Hawaii, a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
M:	Uh, uh-hau, uh,
A:	and so, I went to Hawaii and then to Australia and Japan and China,
M:	Oh, how nice.
A:	I, I, actually I didn't go diving.
M:	Oh, uh-hoh.
A:	I, I'm a diver and so, that's, that's actually been another of my favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
M:	Uh, uh-hoh.
A:	but, uh, no I didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef. I drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. The coastline was just incredible. It's huge.
M:	Oh, I bet it is.
A:	Australia. Yeah.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, but,
M:	I think, uh, in this area, we have a good reputation for, uh
A:	I don't remember if I had shrimp.
M:	No, you don't have to have, you have to get a special permission.
A:	I don't think so.
M:	Oh, I'm not sure. I don't, I don, I think we had some. We had some, uh, shrimp that was just, uh.
A:	Oh, I like that too. But, uh, in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car, it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it like in the van, with a bunch of people.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me of that.
A:	But, uh,
M:	Well, I don't know, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we had a little bit of a contest. We went up to a, uh a reserve lake up near Big Bend and we took a picture of the, uh of the log cabins and of course the log log cabINS and of Big Bend.
A:	And I was by myself in China too.
M:	Oh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Wow.
A:	China was a little bit more, uh, of a challenge. But, it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and so I never, you know, got out by myself, or not much,
M:	Yeah. Uh-hue.
A:	No, actually I paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit, no maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less, I don't really remember, for ten days including all my meals, a guide, a car, the airfare and,  but this is from Hong Kong,
M:	Oh, really.
A:	because I was already in Hong Kong and, um, but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and I went to Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and actually then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it. It's a little, uh, sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai. It's just a train ride.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	And that, I had two internal, one, yeah, two internal plane flights and a couple of other things. It was really,
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Around a thousand.
M:	Yeah, well, that's pretty good actually.
A:	Oh, Japan's ridiculous.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And I stayed, I didn't stay in the top of the line hotels but I stayed in, they were all completely clean,
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and, you know, they were newly built and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line, hotels, because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Right. Right.
M:	!!!!,!!eston!!Yeah!!We were just out there with, uh, uh a ball.
A:	Uh, but yeah, that was, I highly recommend that way to go. If you're ever interested in going the route, I dealt with this woman, her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	Yeah. Uh, and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver and a guide
M:	Oh, yeah, yeah
A:	and then,
