M:	And so, you, you can't really make judgments based on that, based on one person, you're not, you have to make judgments on six people.
A:	Right.
M:	And then the judge decides whether or not it's, uh.
A:	Right. they
M:	I mean, I think, I mean, it's, it, it is a terrible problem.
A:	Right.
M:	So,
A:	Well,  how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, a car type accident where, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?
M:	I think it should be based on the number of people that were killed.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I think that's a, I donno, I'm not sure that's, that's really the right way to do it. I, I, uh I think, I would agree with you that there should be some way of checking for, uh, uh, you, you can't just say, you've, you're, you have a certain age that you're going to be drug tested and then you can say, well I'm sure you have drug use.
A:	Huh.
M:	You know, and I think, I think that, that's, that would be unfair to the jury because they have to decide whether or not they want to hear the facts.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I think, I don't know, I, I'm not sure that it's that important. I think they should have more say.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but I don't think it's a, a necessity.
A:	Right.
M:	So I don't, I donno, I, I think, I'm not, I mean, I just think it's not going to be, it's going to have to be unanimous.
A:	Yeah. That's true.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Huh.
M:	but it's not, you can't do that.
A:	Oh, out of As opposed to the insurance paying the bills,
M:	Yeah. Right.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, we're,  Who, who
M:	We're  we're in the process of, of building a, a system.
A:	do they get, they get insured, they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work?
M:	Uh, they, they're, they go through the process of selection.
A:	Oh, okay, your talking about
M:	I'm talking about the, the insurance companies, the ones that are, that are paying out huge amounts of money to these people.
A:	Sure.
M:	and they, and they have to pay for it themselves.
A:	Okay. Well,
M:	So, uh, that's the first thing they look for is if you're going to do it that way.
A:	But in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance, if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings.
M:	Right.
A:	That, For, oh, Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me of that. That's a very good example.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I mean, they have no way of knowing if the person is guilty or innocent.
A:	Right. That will,
M:	And that will make it even more difficult for them.
A:	Huh.
M:	And, uh, I, I think it's, it's going to be a big problem. Uh, the way our tax laws are structured and, uh you can't just tax people out of the work place, uh.
A:	Sure. Okay.
M:	!!!%!! translated.
