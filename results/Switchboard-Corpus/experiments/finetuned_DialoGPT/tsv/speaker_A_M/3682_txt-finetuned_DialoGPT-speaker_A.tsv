A:	if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed.
M:	Uh, well I think that's the, that's a good thing, I think, I, I've, I had friends that have done that, and I thought that was a very good thing.
A:	Yeah. And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out.
M:	Uh, I, I think that's the problem with magazines.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and then, you know, I just kind of let it cook and then I let it cool and then you can just leave it in the refrigerator.
A:	Exactly.
M:	I don't have to wait till I'm in the kitchen.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, and I think it's wonderful that there's a lot of people who don't have that, and, and are just totally indifferent.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, I think that's, that's a big benefit.
A:	Uh-huh
M:	and then they would come over to my house and just spend an hour or two finishing a plate.
A:	Uh-huh, you'd just do it.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	.
M:	And I, I, it's not like I have to make a bunch of spaghetti or something.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's fun.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We went to the, uh, the steak place down off of, uh of, off of Belt Line.
A:	Um. Boy I like that.
M:	So.
A:	Yeah, well I'm planning a, and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, it's, it, it is really a good thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then I'll make a, a big, um, huge pot over the middle and cover the whole area.
A:	Yeah, that's fun. Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's, it was, it, it really was good.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but it's not, it isn't worth the price tag you pay.
A:	Yeah, that's a good idea.
M:	And, uh, so that's, that was a good thing to do, and I don't know if you have kids or not, but I know we have a lot of friends that like to go to movies, and they go to like six o'clock in the morning, you know, just go and get dressed, and and then go in the afternoons.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I, I have a, a girlfriend that I, I, that I play with occasionally. I don't, you know, she likes to play with people, and so I, she's a real good friend of mine. And I play the piano, and I play that, and, and she's, you're right, I'm not a real great piano player, so I play it more as a, as a stress management thing.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh, yeah.
M:	and, uh, we don't really have, uh really a structured budget. We have a set amount we spend, you know, and we donate it to them, and then we just keep it for, you, you never know, the next year it will be gone and then, you can't use it for anything.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's not a big, uh, big deal.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So I'm always going to my house.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, I'm not really going to have much choice, I guess.
A:	Yeah, that's good. Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, uh-uh
A:	It's very easy to.
M:	Oh, I'll have to try that.
A:	You don't like it?
M:	No, huh-uh.
A:	Oh, you do, okay, yeah. I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want, and then you just.
M:	!!!% Okay, okay.
A:	Yeah, over uncooked rice
M:	Okay.
A:	and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven, and it just.
M:	Okay.
A:	It fluffs up, and it's really moist.
M:	I'll bet.
A:	Uh-huh, wow, yeah.
M:	And then you just cover it with a, uh, newspaper, and you cover it and then you put it in a microwave for about five minutes, and then, uh put it on the next plate and, uh and cover it. And you can put, uh carrots and green peppers and, and green olives on there too.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	So I, I, uh, I try to, I like to make sure I don't make too many mistakes
A:	Well, I'll keep that one in mind.
M:	Yeah, I don't know if I've ever had, uh, you know, a real good, uh, real good ham, or if I'd just had ham.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I've been trying to make a, a fajita now, and I'm not, you know, I don't know if it's fajitas or what, but, you just put it on the outside and you marinate it and you put, uh, put tomato sauce over it and I just love that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and I was going, okay, I'm going to take that, that, and then I took, um.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner,
M:	Yeah, it's not, it, it doesn't really,
A:	or, you know semi .
M:	Uh, well, I'm not really into formal dining out, I, I like just having a nice meal.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, um, I don't know. I guess, I just, I guess I'm not, I'm just not really into it.
A:	Yeah. You put in, um
M:	And, uh, it's a good thing to have, because it makes the, uh the meatballs come out a lot bigger.
A:	let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice or,
M:	Uh, I don't remember. It was something like that.
A:	It depends on, you can really vary it.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, flavor. Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I mean, it's not like it's a big, uh, thick piece of something,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, that's the type of thing I like to experiment with. I, uh I, it's, it was, it, it seemed to be a very interesting thing to do. I don't know, it sounds like you might enjoy it.
A:	Um, let's see. I think it was an hour. I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy.
M:	Oh, I see.
A:	Yeah. But, I think it's about an hour.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Or maybe it's only half hour. Um, you just, until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone.
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Okay.
A:	Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster.
M:	Okay.
A:	Yeah, I liked your idea too, there.
M:	I, I like the idea.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then you can either go ahead and cook it in the microwave or you can just leave it in there and let it rise and then, uh, heat it up.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	Uh, you can, you don't have to be, you have to, you've just put it in there, you just have to accept it. I don't know how long it takes, I guess.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I love it when they come home and they're just lonesome and, and the smell is just,    just absolutely wonderful.
