A:	and, uh, uh, I can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog, though.
M:	Oh, it's just the worst part, the, the second time, I'm not sure how old the dog is, but it's, uh
A:	She's, I mean she's that, this young and she's almost housebroken.
M:	Uh, uh-hau.
A:	I mean she actually asks to go out.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh, yeah I was amazed. Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality. I don't know, I can't imagine what, uh, would have been wrong with this dog, so.
M:	Well, I think, I, I don, I guess I, it's, it seems to me that the, the, uh the, it, the temperament of this dog is unusual. I mean, I've had dogs that, that I think are really very aggressive and they bark and they, you know, they're not really scared of their owner, you, you're just, you don't, you can't, uh you can just, uh put them down and let them run around and,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I think that, that we, we've lost some things in our family, you know, but, but I think they, they, I think it's one of the most enjoyable things to do.
A:	Oh, really.
M:	She's a miracle baby.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, we have had, uh, a couple of dogs, uh
A:	Oh, yeah. I had a, uh, last year I had I had another German Shepherd, now this one was purebred and, uh, he, when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but, uh, managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,
M:	Oh.
A:	and, uh, and on huge doses of antibiotics, and he actually got over it with, seven hundred dollars in vet bills,
M:	Oh my goodness.
A:	um, but he had actually was able to get him over that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And then he was gaining weight again, was just getting healthy, and, uh, he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac.
M:	Oh, my.
A:	So, I couldn't believe it. That was, that was really hard.
M:	Well, that's, that, that is, that would be tough.
A:	And that was even harder for, I was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they just felt absolutely awful.
M:	I bet.
A:	And I felt, felt probably worse for them than, than for me because, oh gosh they, the, uh, this fellow's wife who was, uh, watching the dog, she, I think she loved that dog more than I did and, uh. She was really attached to it,
M:	Oh.
A:	but, uh, it's unfortunate, but now, I've got another one, so.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, see, he, it, it was just over a year.
M:	Oh, he waited a year?
A:	Uh, it was in March of last year. So, uh, yeah, it'd been, didn't, didn't have one for a whole year.
M:	Oh, well, I guess they just, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	I just, I was absolutely,
A:	Right.
M:	so I just went ahead and got one.
A:	My dad's like that, he, uh, he had a beagle that he loved and, uh, when that beagle passed away, uh, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog, there's no way,
M:	Yeah. That's right.
A:	no how, and then, uh, the, he the beagle died in I guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, uh, I or, I Humane Society and got, uh, got another one, a stray.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	And she, she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing, but, mom went an,
M:	Oh, no.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!!eting!!
A:	Yeah, it is. Well hopefully this one here, Cocoa will live a full life
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and she's just about ready to go.
A:	Right.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Oh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and she's got the old nose and the old ears,
A:	Yeah.
M:	but she's got the, the little eyes, and the little nose,
A:	That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them,
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	they're always, always happy. I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
M:	Oh, they, they really do.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, and she's just a wonderful, wonderful temperament,
A:	Right.
M:	and,
A:	This, this friend of mine has, well it's the same guy that was watching, uh, my German Shepherd when he got hit, but, uh, went fishing with him on Friday and took, he's got a full, a pure bred Golden Retriever and then I had, uh, the puppy, a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing. And this, they just, they had a ball romping around,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, you know, you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.
M:	Right. That's true.
A:	And, uh, this Golden Retriever jumped in the, the, really fast moving, uh, river current, and, uh.
M:	Oh, yeah, I think that's what they call it.
A:	Well no, actually he had no trouble at all. He first jumped in and I, he's, he's just about a year old himself and never had really, I don't think he'd swum before.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But he jumped in, in the, the river.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the, I was careful to keep her away from the, the fast moving water,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	'cause if she fell in then I'd of been, had to go in after her. And up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now.
M:	Oh.
A:	And I would not have been fun trying to retrieve her, but, uh, this dog, Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do I do now, as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and, uh, actually paddled up against the current and, uh, made it back to the shore and climbed up and then, he, he jumped in again, and he was swimming for quite a bit, all afternoon. He loved it.
M:	Oh.
A:	Cocoa didn't think too much of it, though. She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out. I pulled her out and, uh, then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad,
M:	Oh, goodness.
A:	and so, but, uh, she got over it, so.
M:	Oh, that's, that, that is a, a nice dog.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but she, she, um, got to be a little bit, um
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah, I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here, um, it's on Oneida lake and I'm wondering if, uh, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year. I mean, I've got, the yard's all fenced in so she doesn't run loose, but, uh, she could go in sometime when, if I'm watching her,
M:	Yeah.
A:	so.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh really.
M:	She, she's just been a real trooper, and I've been trying to get her out of that situation, because it's just so hard to get out of the water.
A:	Yeah.
M:	She just kept fighting, and I just couldn't deal with it.
A:	No, no.
M:	I haven't seen that one yet.
A:	Oh really.
M:	Yeah. We, we got it at a, uh a movie place in Chicago.
A:	Oh, okay, my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too. And that was the thing I couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake, it wasn't like he didn't
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	normally, I mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet, but if you wanted to get him wet, forget it.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and he'd just kind of jump on it like he was having a fight or whatever.
A:	Right, right, obstinate, obstinate.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that now.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I thought, well, I don t remember this being on T V but I was thinking that was a really good movie.
A:	I'll have to check it out. I saw the, the, uh, previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie, but,
M:	I think it was.
A:	uh, really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	But, I got to do more, more fun things.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	Yeah, yeah. Well I'm, uh, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so I travel a lot.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	And yeah, I'm a engineer at, uh at the laboratory, Rolm Laboratory, Griffis Air Force Base, up here, so.
M:	Okay, yeah, yeah that's, that's where I work.
A:	That's how I got into, uh, into the switchboard project and all that, so.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	But it's nice having a dog here, uh, the,
M:	Yeah.
A:	uh, what's the, what's the word I'm looking for, uh, lots of affection, no unconditional affection from the, from the dog.
M:	Oh.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
A:	No, no.
M:	Okay.
A:	Yeah, well, it's been nice talking to you, we seem to be degenerating here, so
