M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I see.
M:	And then I just plan on getting, getting, uh getting a router and, uh trying to get it up and running.
A:	Yeah, you do a lot more area than I do. I've, all the rest of my yard, backyard is, uh, you know, pool and decking it's all the dirt I have, left in my backyard
M:	Yeah
A:	Well, I I enjoy fiddling around. It's cheap entertainment.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It is, uh-huh.
M:	Uh, I like to fish and there's some places here that will take fish and also some places where you can catch them for food.
A:	That's right. Yeah.
M:	and, uh, it is fun.
A:	I enjoy, Excuse me, go ahead. Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	That's right. That's right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Takes a lot of room.
M:	Yeah, it does.
A:	It sure does. I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe, my goodness, what a mistake that was.
M:	Yeah.
A:	They do. Well, it was very good it just takes up, you know, like you say, a lot of your garden area.
M:	Uh-hums.
A:	It's the first and only time I've done that. We don't do anything exotic we just do, oh, tomatoes, bell peppers, radishes and turnips, I mean, not turnips, carrots, beets and things like that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	My wife used to plant a few snow peas. I don't really care for snow peas. Well, she just plants a few for herself.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Did you really?
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I see.
M:	And they had a big roast last year, and it was fantastic.
A:	Okay. We don't start anything indoors we, just wait until, you know, the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Probably so. Yeah, you can get a head start on it. like ice in
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	I guess it, it, might would,
M:	Yeah, it gets, it might, it really does.
A:	yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	and, and, uh.
A:	Well it will make, it will make them taste better I'm sure.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Sure. You got to inspect it, yeah.
M:	so.
A:	Sure.
M:	so, I mean, it's, it can be a real problem.
A:	Sure.
M:	And, uh, and the kids just love it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But I don't do any of that. I do, uh, like, uh I, I have a little seedling, you know, that I, that grows like crazy.
A:	No.
M:	But, uh, I, it's fun.
A:	I, this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and boy, it is really nice,
M:	It is.
A:	it sure beats dragging hoses around.
M:	Yeah, it sure does.
A:	That's right. That's right. It's really nice.
M:	It really is.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then I'll get it ready and then just leave it in the tub.
A:	I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard. I, I really don't enjoy doing that. I enjoy having a nice looking yard,
M:	Uh, uh-hue.
A:	I just don't enjoy the work, that it takes to get it done.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months, you know, until I retired
M:	Uh.
A:	and now I, I've lost my excuse for that so I have to for the last couple of years I've done it myself.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	It is kind of expensive, it is.
M:	Well, that's true, but I think, you know, it's a matter of, of, uh
A:	Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.
M:	Right.
A:	That's right. If I have a problem discipline, you know, I think, now, boy, I really need to get out, you know, and apply something, you know, and I screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something.
M:	Well, you're right. I, I, you, you probably have a better solution than what's been offered.
A:	That's right.
M:	but, you, you have to go out and do it.
A:	That's right. I'm, I'm kind of bad about that.
M:	Yeah, well, I mean, I've had, uh, a couple of times when I've, uh
A:	I enjoyed having a lawn service but now I have the time and I really can't, I really you know, don't,  want to spend the money for it.
M:	Oh, no. Oh, no, no
A:	Yeah. That's right. I'm not limited to, just mowing it on Saturday morning, you know,
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	I can do it on most any day of the week.
M:	Yeah, I know, I, I just, I'm, I am a real good gardener, I enjoy it when I do it. I don't like to mow it, I guess, because I think it's too messy.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	But, uh, I don't know, I, I just, I find it a little boring, you're right. It's, it's, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	they'll say, oh, I'm sorry, this is not easy, this isn't easy.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, and then, you know, the, the news, the T V, the kids are usually in bed by that time.
A:	That's coming up here pretty soon. Is it this weekend?
M:	Uh, no, it's probably next weekend.
A:	It's pretty soon.
M:	Yeah, I'm, I've been waiting for a, I guess it's been delayed, but I'm not sure whether they'll call it TWELVE ANGRY or not.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh,
A:	I believe it is too.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Well,
M:	I think that's what I heard, too. I don't know what the exact figures are, but I know they range, I mean, it's like anywhere from a hundred thousand to a thousand.
A:	Uh, not a whole lot, uh. I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust, you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then, again, I don't want the bugs eating it upping either.
M:	No, no, no. It's not that big a deal.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But I had some that were, you know, just really bad, you just, you didn't know what you were getting into.
A:	Uh-huh. Right. Uh-huh.
M:	And they're just wonderful tasting, I mean, you can just taste the goodness in them.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh, you know, the, the texture of it is just wonderful.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right.
M:	and I went and I took it back and I put it back in the middle of the garden and it was dead.
A:	Absolutely. They really go through it,
M:	Yeah. I think, I think that's a wonderful thing.
A:	they really do. Yeah.
M:	and, and, uh, you know, and I, I, it's something that, uh I think it would be very difficult for me to completely understand.
A:	You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Boy, they'll strip,
M:	Oh, no.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and,
A:	I did something a little bit different this year that I haven't done before, I've got, my garden is shaped that I can, it's kind like this, uh, box shape, so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box. And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
M:	Uh-hum.
A:	and, you know, various other things, Raised it up.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me.
A:	And I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have, oh, I'll have less of a bug problem at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, I, I decided that, that's not going to be a problem.
A:	Yeah, Right.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's, it's not very, uh uh, green,
A:	That's right, you, you have to work on. You, really do.
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	That's right. When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, you know, for my garden so I had, I had a lot of loam out there to start with I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with,
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hum.
A:	No. I don't, I did it by hand,
M:	Oh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	How about you?
A:	It wasn't too much of a job,  really.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Like I say it's just,
M:	I don't know. I don't, I donno, I think it's really good. I mean, it's not like they're going, you know, they're robbing people and then they're putting their stuff in people's houses.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It would be handy.
M:	Well, I, I do enjoy gardening.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But it's real easy to get the little one to pull the weeds and get to them.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it, it is really, it's a really good deterrent.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh, so it's, it's nice to have a little variety, you know.
A:	It might be handy,
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, it's got a built in pulley system.
A:	They're pretty neat little, I've never seen one.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
M:	but, uh, it's a pretty neat car.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh Right. Yeah. That would be neat, sure.
M:	But, uh, yeah, I'm not, I don't know, I think I'm going to have to get one in a while, I just, I need to put money on it, I guess.
A:	We've had a garden, gosh, for years and years and years, of some size, you know,
M:	Uh-hum.
A:	I can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, got, you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom
M:	Uh.
A:	and, uh, I've got carrots, I yes, I've got a few carrots up and I've got some radishes up,
M:	Uh.
A:	and as a matter of fact, I've already done a second row of radishes.
M:	Oh.
A:	And, uh, the green onions are coming along.
M:	Yeah, that's what we're trying to decide, we're, we've been trying to think, we went to get some of the squash, and we're going to try to get the, uh carrots, too.
A:	Snow,
M:	Yeah, I think that's the first thing I want is snow to fall so I can get back in the mountains.
A:	excuse me.
M:	!!!%!! translated It's snowing on the west side of Colorado, right?
A:	Yes, I've for the first time we planted them this year.
M:	Oh, that's wonderful.
A:	Yeah. We tried to find them last year, we screwed around and waited too long and I couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But we've got some this year.
M:	You're lucky.
A:	Snow peas are up and, uh, my wife does, uh, a small herb garden on the side.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	They're up and doing fine.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!ety sure!!
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of a, let down.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Oh, I bet,
M:	I bet.
A:	they were. That's right. We use a lot, we sure do.
M:	I know.
A:	Yeah. One nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have, you know, too many.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh. We did that too,
M:	And, uh, we put, we just put them in the freezer.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Makes, uh, makes a colorful salad too.
M:	!!!% That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And then I, uh
A:	We planted some yellow peppers this year. We've tried it, before
M:	Uh.
A:	and nope, we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.
M:	Yeah, it's just so full of things that you can eat.
A:	They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. We enjoy fooling around with it.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	Beets. Yeah, we've got some beets, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. I've never done potato. We used to do it at home when I was a kid, had a huge garden.
M:	Oh, you did?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I don't know if I'll ever get rid of them.
A:	It takes a, yeah, it does take some space.
M:	I think it's a big waste of money,  to keep somebody else's garbage
A:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. I see.
M:	but I'm, I'm not, I don't know, I think we're going to have to do too much to our food,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, we're, we've, we, we do, uh we do have a garden, but we don't have it right now.
A:	Uh-huh. That will be neat, yeah.
M:	And, uh, we are, we were thinking about that the other day and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, we've got a pretty good size root tree, and we put them in there every year. We have a pretty small porch, and I think it's, uh
A:	That will be neat, yeah. Absolutely, they're expensive.
M:	Yeah, and, and they, and we got a couple of those little, um. They're, they have the rounded bottom lid on them.
A:	I don't know unless it, labor intensive or something. I really, don't know.
M:	Yeah.
A:	That will be interesting.
M:	Yeah, and, and it's just, it's not that I want to cut the garden or anything, but I want it to be something that I can enjoy and I can make and serve and,
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, that's interesting. Well, I guess we're supposed to discuss crime in America, aren't we?
A:	Sure. Yeah.
M:	but I'm, I'm pretty much the same way. I, I've got a, I have a, a nineteen eighty-nine Honda Civic, which is, you, you wouldn't believe, I mean, I, you'd say it's a dream car, but I've had it for about four years now,
A:	That's interesting.
M:	Yeah, and I, I think it's really neat because it's a different way of looking at it, you see.
A:	Well, I'll let you go it's,
