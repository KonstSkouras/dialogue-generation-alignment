M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he said every time I turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday I was tell him, you have to, you're supposed to squeeze the plastic jugs before you take them up there.
M:	Right.
A:	Every time he turns around I'm giving him some new rule, where you're supposed to squish up the, you know, like collapse the plastic jugs. Instead of taking them up there solid.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And I wish that our recycling center took paper bags. They won't take those. We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And we have to bring the paper bags back every time. Because they won't take them.
M:	Oh.
A:	Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up?
M:	No, I don't take any of those papers.
A:	Uh-huh. We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though, our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but we do take cans.
A:	Yeah, it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do, but. Do you, um, have any ideas on anything that would make,
M:	Well, I don't know. I've always, I've never, uh, thought about getting involved in any type of recycling, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, and I know some places will take, uh newspaper, and they'll also take plastic bags, and, uh you know.
A:	Right.
M:	and, and then you put it in your regular trash.
A:	Yeah that would be a good idea.
M:	Uh-uh. I mean, I, I think, I know that there are a lot more people that use plastic.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I'm not sure how you would, uh, how you'd route getting there and then getting it there.
A:	Right. Yeah, that would be a real good motivation for people.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right. Yeah, my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags, like you buy your garbage bag from the city,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything, so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away, that's how many you have to pay for.
M:	Oh, that sounds good.
A:	Yeah. Yeah that would be a real good idea. I'm trying to think if there's anything else I could think of. They are talking about going to curbside pickup in our, in our city .
M:	Uh,
A:	Rowlett, Texas.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Do you know where that is?
M:	Yeah.
A:	And I don't know if they decided to do, or not, but I think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that. Although, I think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even, break even point,  without charging people.
M:	Yeah. That's true.
A:	Yeah I don't know, uh, I guess it just depends on how they manage it.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff. The center that they've got now where you take your stuff in I, I think that should be making some money. Since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week.
M:	Well, that's, that, that would be good.
A:	And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it.
M:	Well, that's true.
A:	But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable. I don't, a lot of that's that recyclable steel and I don't know anybody that takes that.
M:	Right.
A:	my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum, so we can't, can't ever recycle them. I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
M:	I don't think it would be any better, because you wouldn't be able to throw it away.
A:	Yeah, that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	It was good talking to you.
M:	You too.
A:	Uh, bye.
M:	Bye-bye.
