M:	And I think that that's a big part of it.
A:	Well, that's good. Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.
M:	Yeah, I'm trying to, I've been trying to get my little girl to, uh, school and I'm just, I don't know, I, I was just thinking of, I thought, you know, a couple of days ago, I talked to a lady that was in a high school, and she said, Well, she, she's going to school. And, uh.
