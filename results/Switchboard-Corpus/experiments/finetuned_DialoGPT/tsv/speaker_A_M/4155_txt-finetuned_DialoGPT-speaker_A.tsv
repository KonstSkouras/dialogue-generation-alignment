M:	Uh-huh.
A:	What do you do?
M:	I'm a nurse.
A:	I guess that, I mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I'm not, you know, I don't mind paying the sales tax, it's just that I'm, I, I feel like, you, you're, you have to pay for the privilege of living here.
A:	Right.
M:	So, I'm not real sure what we're going to do about it.
A:	Oh, sure.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right.
M:	So, um.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, um.
A:	Right.
M:	But, uh, I guess, uh.
A:	Uh, well, no, I can't really complain. I'm a student, um, and I I work as a co-op at, uh, Georgia Tech Research Institute. And, uh, I'm going to get back most of what I earned, I mean most of what I pay in taxes and, uh, and, uh,  one of my parents is still claiming me.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	Huh? Uh-huh. I'm sure
M:	I mean, they don't expect you to, you know, be, uh...
A:	I went, well I did work, um, just very for some time but I didn't make enough money to really make,  too much of a difference.
M:	Uh-hauhuh, uh-h.
A:	Right.
M:	Um.
A:	No, no, I haven't.
M:	You haven't?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, um.
A:	Huh.
M:	He's been a, a, uh a very strong supporter of the Sandinistas, and he's been trying to, to, uh make it on his own.
A:	Oh. Really?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh, we've got, we have a, a lot of, uh we have, uh a lot, a good size garden,  and a lot that we do.
A:	Oh, sure.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I'm just wondering, you know, how much are they going to be able to deduct?
A:	Wow.
M:	And I, and I, you know, I just, I feel like, you, you can't, you don't have to pay for it, you just have to accept it.
A:	Uh-huh. taxes.
M:	so I'm paying twice as much as I would have been paying in taxes. So, I don't know, I, I think that's a problem with the, the, uh, the economy.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so I don't, I don tinker with it too much.
A:	Huh.
M:	But, uh, I,
A:	Yeah.
M:	And it's, it's amazing that people don't realize this.
A:	No, no, I haven't. Uh, I, uh, my father pays for my, my schooling, my tuition. So, uh, I'm, I haven't made use of that.
M:	Yeah, you're, you know, you get a lot of student loans,
A:	Physics.
M:	Yeah. What's that?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Everybody says that
M:	Yeah.
A:	Huh.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Um, I haven't, I haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet. Actually, um, the, the degree I'm getting is physics. There's a different one for applied physics so I guess you could call it more straight stuff than applied.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I doubt about that. Are, are, is America, I mean are we pretty, pretty steep compared to most countries?
M:	Well, I don't know, I think, uh, I, I'm not really sure, um. I think it's a, it's probably a, a pretty good indicator of how well you're handling the problem.
A:	No, I don't think so either.
M:	You know, I think, uh, in, in some ways it's better to have the metric system and, and, uh the English system, you know, it seems like, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, you know, it's, it is, it, it seems like it's a lot more lax, you can't really make everything seem like you're going to be good, you're not going to get caught every time.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, you know, and, and I think it's going to be real important. I think the, the way the government is running it's really going to have to get even more important.
