M:	Oh, no.
A:	So if they would come up, curbside recycling,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Well, now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart?
M:	Yeah, they, they have, they've moved them, I think they moved the other one, um, to a different place, and, uh, they're trying to, to put some recycling there, and it's just, uh.
A:	Oh, God.
M:	They're, they're really trying to, trying to start that trend.
A:	Oh. That's really nice to know, because we were doing the same thing. Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they're open, you know, which is always a real pain.
M:	Yeah, we've, I've had to stop and think about that because, um, I don't know, it's just, I just, it, it seems ridiculous.
A:	And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot, we thought, oh, this is great. And we started taking them up there. And then, all the sudden, it disappeared, you know I didn't know. And we're going, oh, no, there goes our recycling place.
M:	Yeah.
A:	That's really nice to find out that it's behind there Well, we pretty much do, um, plastic milk cartons and, um, um, um, newspapers. I couldn't even think of what you call them.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Plastic milk cartons, newspapers and cans, and glass, I guess, is the four, is really the four things that we do.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I guess we've got to wait a little bit.
A:	And really, that's about, that's really about it. Is there anything, any place else that really takes anything other than that, that you know of?
M:	Uh, we, uh, we have, uh.
A:	Oh, really.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know.
M:	so.
A:	I know. I know. We're kind of the same way. You know, at first, you know, you, at first it was a real, it was a real hassle, and I'm wondering are we really going to do this, but you kind of get, I guess, into a little routine, you know, where it becomes, is automatic, now, to throw, different things in different places,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	you know. So I just go, you know, we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and I've just got three trash cans sitting in there, you know, we just kind of dump things in each one, if, you know, if we get them,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so.
M:	Well, I think that's really important.
A:	Oh, they do, too. And they're impossible to crush. I mean, you can't get the down to any size, you know. If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag, you know pretty easily, so. You know,
M:	Well, I don't know.
A:	Oh, really.
M:	Yeah, and I, and, and it's, it's been a real problem for me.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	And, uh, they were real convenient and, uh.
A:	Oh, that will be good.
M:	so.
A:	Sure. Let somebody get something out of it.
M:	Yeah, yeah, it's a real good idea.
A:	Yeah
M:	I mean, that's just, that, that just isn't right.
A:	Ha-ha Well, I was kind of hoping with, you know, do you work for T I?
M:	Yeah, I do.
A:	No. Yeah. There was a, T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs. And, you know, we're recycling aluminum cans up here and, uh, just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know, and that's, they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program. It's, you know, T I doesn't give them any money, all, everything is made from that. And they had talked about having a thing like, one Saturday a month, you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home, you know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	And I'm kind of like, yeah. I shall, they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it, you know. That was going to use it for good, so,
M:	Well, I think that's a great idea.
A:	Sounds like you have a little one just like I do
M:	Yeah, I do.
A:	Yeah. Mine was two in December
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Well, it was good to talk to you.
M:	It was good talking to you too.
A:	Oh, do they really. Curbside pick up?
M:	Oh yeah, and, uh, it's, it, it is really weird. They have, uh a little bit of a strangler down there.
A:	I really hope they do that in Louisville. It would make it a lot easier on all of us. Talk to you later.
M:	All righty.
A:	Bye-bye.
