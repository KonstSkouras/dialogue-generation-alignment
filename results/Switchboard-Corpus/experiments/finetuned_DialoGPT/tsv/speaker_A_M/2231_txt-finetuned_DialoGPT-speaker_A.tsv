M:	Yeah.
A:	Yes. Yes. Not getting paroled, let's say in so many, years.
M:	Right.
A:	I mean, if your going to sentence somebody, let's say twenty years, let them stay twenty years.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	There has, that's right.
M:	And I think that that, that there needs to be a balance somewhere.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I don't know how that would work. I, I don tought about that in the courtroom, but I'm not sure how that works.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	And then, you know, they have to go back to work and they have their day care, and, and that's about it, you, you can't really do much for them.
A:	Uh-huh. That's right. That's, honestly right.
M:	Yeah, it's kind of sad.
A:	Uh, they sure are just because, some innocent person, can really,
M:	Uh.
A:	it seems like, really a rough time
M:	Yeah.
A:	you know? I'm not saying innocent person, let's say someone wrote a hot check, for instance. You know, it seems like when they go to prison, it, they really seem like it's a rough time for them
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	he's just there to serve his time, and get back out on the street.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, and I don't think that's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	it's going, well, it's not going to be any better, you're just going to have to deal with it, and that's the way it's always been, and, and it's just going, you have to accept that, you can't let it get to that point, you, you just have to live with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, that would just leave them in jail for life.
A:	Time, uh-huh. Yes. I was, I would just be, I would love to see them just really get real strict on parole you know.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	You know, you, you've got to go out there and, and kill somebody just to get out of it.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah. You get, it back, yeah.
M:	But, uh, you also get someone like Jimmy Carter who's like, who's twenty-one or twenty-two years old who's, who, uh who's very old and has done some horrible things and, uh you know  you give him up for some reason or other,
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh,
A:	Yeah. But it's, I, I know.
M:	I, I don't think it's possible to do much about, you know, like, uh, the crime in the cities. I think, I think it would be good to have some kind of, you, you have to have a police force, you got to have people that are together to deal with it.
A:	Same thing, Yes.
M:	and, and I don't see,  any way of rehabilitation or anything,  for these people.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh.
M:	and I,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And they are not the same as the people that are living in the country.
A:	Uh, a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it, because it hasn't happened to them, which it hasn't to me either, you know?
M:	Right.
A:	Thank goodness. But still, it could.
M:	Well, I don't know, I, I'm sure it will.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh.
M:	and they're going to have to do it again.
A:	And as far as the other states, I honestly don't know what their capital punishment is. You know, I, I, haven't kept up, you know, anything, like that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I don't think it was ever really taken seriously.
A:	Uh. Uh-huh.
M:	but, I don't, I'm not sure what the punishment would be for those people.
A:	Yes. But still, it came up though, didn't it,
M:	I think it was a case of opportunity.
A:	I mean, you know
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they didn't, they didn tershape the sentence.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So he was sentenced to death and then, uh, he was allowed to go back and, uh and serve his time in the paroled.
A:	Yes. The victim is really, seems like left out in the cold, more or less, doesn't it,
M:	Yes, it does.
A:	in a lot of, well, especially in things, you pick up the paper, and you read, you know, you think, oh my goodness
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and he's been found guilty of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it's, it's a very complicated case, and the jury may not be able to recommend, you might say, uh, sentencing, or, or a mistrial, you're right, they may not even be able, to recommend a jury.
A:	Or, you know, plead insanity.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Oh yes,
M:	Yeah.
A:	uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	but I don't know, maybe they should have been more clear.
A:	Yes. I, it just, just doesn't make sense,
M:	No.
A:	I,
M:	and, and it's not safe at all.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, you know, I, I can go out at like eleven thirty in the morning and just be by myself.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, like I, said, I live in a small place. You know.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But, uh, even the small towns now though, has really changed from when I was a kid, but now I'm raising children. It it really is.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	See them. Yeah. Yeah. It really is. Well, we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty, soon,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but I've enjoyed talking to you.
M:	Well, it was nice talking to, to you too.
A:	Bye
M:	Okay, um, I don't know, what do you think about the death penalty.
A:	okay. Bye-bye
