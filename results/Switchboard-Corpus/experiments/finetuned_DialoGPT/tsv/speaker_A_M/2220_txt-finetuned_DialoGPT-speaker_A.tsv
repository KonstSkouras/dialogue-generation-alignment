M:	Yeah, I like that.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I like a variety, I like a good, uh, uh
A:	But not all country. I don't like that, when they start,
M:	Uh, that's true.
A:	I don't know. I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh,
A:	My truck is broken down.
M:	and I know.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, uh, you're right, I think that, uh you know that, you have to have some, uh a commitment on, uh  rehabilitation and, and, you don't want somebody that's addicted or whatever to, uh
A:	There, there's a guy, have you ever heard of George Winston, he plays piano.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	I think he's dead now, but he plays wonderfully.
M:	Yeah, I, I like, I think that was one of the most, um, I don't know, I guess, the most consistently, um.
A:	I like that.
M:	Yeah, he's, uh, he was a really interesting character.
A:	Very badly. I've got a piano,
M:	Uh, well, I, I do, I have a, a brother-in-law who, uh, plays the piano.
A:	my mother got a piano and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, so we all had to take lessons, and I was the one that did the least poorly, so she gave it to me. And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. It is real relaxing.
M:	That's great.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, I'm not, I don't know, I, I just, I guess I, you just have to be aware of what you're doing and, and how you're going to do it and it's not always the best method.
A:	Oh, so do I.
M:	and I, and so, and it's, it's just like, it, it was just like I was just listening to a story about, about the, the, uh the great depression, and how it got so bad and how we can't fix it anymore, and, and everything like that.
A:	Forgot about that.
M:	Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm, I mean I like to listen to some of the Christian music, but I don 'ever like to, uh you know to, listen to it that much.
A:	I said so do I, I forgot about jazz
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yes, we've got about five of those. I love them.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it
M:	Uh, yeah, I've, I'm a big baseball fan, so I always like to listen to that.
A:	and I just, I heard a piece and it was just so wonderful.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but,
A:	I mean you can just sit, you know those little booklets that come along with it
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	My, my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it.
M:	Right.
A:	Huh?
M:	So, it's, it is a real problem.
A:	I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, but he does.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Were you in the band?
M:	Yeah, I was.
A:	So was I.
M:	so I was pretty close to being in the marching band when I got into high school,
A:	Yeah.
M:	so I, I like to listen to it and I also like the new stuff, you know,
A:	Yeah.
M:	He plays in the band with, uh
A:	I like the Moody Blues. Did you like them?
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So what type, Simply Red, I've never heard of that. Is it just instrumental?
M:	Well, it's, uh it's kind of, uh music, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	And then you can just listen to the instrumental.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Yeah, where are you?
M:	I'm in Plano.
A:	Okay. So we're in Garland.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah
M:	Okay, well, we have a daughter in Texas, and she's, um, she's in the national curriculum, and, uh, she took the national one and she took it, and I took it with me, and then, um I took the one with me also, and it's just the same thing. I don't know, I donno, I, I think I'd have to take the advice, you know, from a, a, an English major to a, to a university, and see how they treat them, you're, you don't have to have a, you have to be an expert to get in on subjects like that, and you have, you've got to be a good student to get an idea of what a subject is.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	Okay.
A:	Just because there's a friend up there, not because there's much else
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	For colleges?
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, they're not
M:	but,
A:	They're not going to recruit me anymore, I'm through. No more for me.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	What, what do you do?
M:	I'm a nurse.
A:	Are you going to go to East Texas for that?
M:	Yeah.
A:	That'd probably be pretty interesting. I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. They had summonsed eight hundred people, about four hundred showed up, and it was for a murder trial.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three.
M:	Huh.
A:	And they had us fill out a long questionnaire. We stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June.
M:	Uh-hauhuh, uh.
A:	And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. I was an investigator and I was tailing the woman that was killed. Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Okay, I, I was just sitting here waiting for somebody to call me.
A:	The, the investigator. Yeah, he, he got off right away.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that, oh, gosh!!
A:	And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so I figure that that will make me biased and I won't be chosen.
M:	Right.
A:	Hopefully
M:	But, uh, I do feel like that, uh...
A:	Yeah. No. *aa
M:	But, uh,
A:	I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody.
M:	Well, I, I don't know, uh I, uh. I think, uh you know in the, in the cases like, uh uh, in, uh England and France where they have the death penalty and you have to register as a, as a social, uh  citizen
A:	You know. Uh-huh.
M:	they would, they would not believe that you know.
A:	Yeah. But then when you're, when you're picked, see I was picked for another murder trial before
M:	Uh-hoh.
A:	oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision.
M:	Uh, yeah.
