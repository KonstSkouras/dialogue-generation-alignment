M:	Well, that's true.
A:	you know what I mean?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I mean, I don t even know what the procedures are.
A:	Right.
M:	I mean, it just, you know, it was just so out of the question.
A:	That's it.
M:	So I think that we have to do something about, uh, the length of the prison sentence.
A:	Well, I, I feel the other thing too, uh, they were saying, uh, you know, what new ways could could it, you, you know, change the system. I, I really think that, uh, we spend a lot of time, uh, going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal, I mean, if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed. If they have been caught, you know, point blank in the crime. There's, uh, no question
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	it's beyond a reasonable doubt. You know, all these things. I mean, you know, we've gone through this over and over again.
M:	Right, well, they could have, uh  taken the money away from the criminal and let them go free and let the judge do it. Uh,
A:	And it can go on for ten, twenty, years.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I, I think this is a little ridiculous.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I, I'm serious. And I think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that exist in the in the criminal system today. With plea bargaining.
M:	Yeah.
A:	You know, if someone is
M:	You mean if they are not guilty,
A:	Well.
M:	If you're, you know, you're a lawyer and you're going to say well I, I can't do this, I have to go back and prove that I can, you can't, because I can make a hundred dollars, you name sounds a lot better than me.
A:	Well, I know. That's what I'm saying. But I think a lot of, all of the whole criminal system is messed up in, in that regard. I mean, you know, people who commit, uh, crimes that they, I don't know how it works exactly but  you know, they get lesser sentences
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and I understand that the jails are full of people, you know, uh  and that they have to do something.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, I think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it.
M:	That's true.
A:	you know what I'm saying? That we don't have, uh, well a lot of states don't have capital punishment.
M:	No, huh-uh.
A:	And, uh I, I think they should.
M:	I do too.
A:	I, and I think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say, it's, it's, there's no doubt whatsoever. Like drunk drivers that kill people and, uh, you know, all
M:	Right, and it's not fair.
A:	they, they're caught dead to rights. I, I just think that that's, they've, they've taken a life and if, they should pay for it with their life.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I think that's the best way to go because then you can, you can get a, a judge to actually decide.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	She served time in a mental hospital and was, uh...
A:	Oh, really.
M:	and he's been back since then, and I've heard that they're really going to, uh, beef up his appeal process.
A:	It, uh, Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	I know that, that Uh-huh. And, I don't know. Uh, what would you do to change it? To make it better?
M:	Well, I, I think there is, there is some things that need to be changed. Uh  like, uh.
A:	Oh, yeah. I, I, I don't agree with that at all.
M:	Uh, you know.
A:	Imagine the guilt that person would have. I mean  burned out.
M:	Yeah.
A:	There's  there's no possible way that you could, uh, you know, feel good about yourself.
M:	Yeah. That's right.
A:	If you had to do something like that, day after day.
M:	Right.
A:	No. Not really.
M:	You know, you can't be sued for anything.
A:	Well, do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	I mean, supposing I come up to you and I just point blank kill you.
M:	Right.
A:	In other words you're saying that, you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But I think, I think it's important that we also examine the legal system and also the criminal side of it, to see how we can improve it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and they could be sitting at the other end of the spectrum and saying, well, I don't want to hear about this, you know.
A:	Well, I, I,
