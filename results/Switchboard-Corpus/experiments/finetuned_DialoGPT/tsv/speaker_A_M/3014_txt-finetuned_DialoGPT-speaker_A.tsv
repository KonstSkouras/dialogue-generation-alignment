M:	Well  you know, it's,  it's getting to be a necessity.
A:	Seems like I just bought it.
M:	Did you?
A:	It's an eighty-nine and I bought it, uh, in, uh, eighty-eight so, yeah.
M:	Yeah, well, I, I've had, uh
A:	I know, I really will do that the next time, I buy it too.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but I'm not sure that it was practical for us.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but we wanted something that was light, you know,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And it's a, uh, three fifty in the morning hours and it's got, uh uh, eight thousand miles on it.
A:	Oh, that's wonderful.
M:	and, uh, it's really, it, it handles just wonderfully.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, okay.
M:	I, I think, uh, I've been around a lot of people that have, uh
A:	Uh-huh. Huh.
M:	So,
A:	Sure.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	or I would stay in the station wagon
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	But do you feel though, uh, craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities?
M:	I, I don't know. I donno, I think it's probably, I mean, I, I've had, I had a, a couple of cars and, uh I think one of them was a ninety-one Ford Taurus.
A:	Is that how you, I have never,
M:	Uh-uh. I never really thought about it that way. I mean, I, I would, I probably would buy a new car every two years.
A:	Its
M:	And the, uh
A:	Isn't that a shame.
M:	I don't know. I, I don't, I just don't think there's a quality difference between the two.
A:	My word isn't that sorry. That's sorry.
M:	I mean, it, it just, it handled like a truck, you couldn't really push it. It was just,
A:	My word.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh, mercy.
M:	I don't know if you're familiar with that but,
A:	You,
M:	Well, my husband had a Volvo and I had a Honda,
A:	Huh.
M:	And, uh, so that's the first car I ever bought new.
A:	Huh.
M:	and it was, uh, it was not a very good one at all.
A:	Huh. Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, it's a hard question, really. I mean, I, I don't know, I guess I, it just seems like there's so many cars that I think are really going to go out of style.
A:	Sure.
M:	it was not, uh, I, I don't know, I guess it's because it was a big, uh large company, I mean, you didn't see a lot of, uh you know you couldn't see too many people that worked for a big company.
A:	No thanks. That's right.
M:	So, I, I'm not really sure what the solution to that is.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I just, I, I felt like, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I think one of them was a seventy-six Buick and the other one was a eighty-seven.
A:	Wow.
M:	And, uh, there was no,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so we had to, we had a, a, we bought a, uh, a used, used, uh C R X. It was a, it was a seventy-seven.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it was a much better car than what we got.
A:	Who makes that car?
M:	Uh, it's a, it was a demo. It was demo'd at a Ford dealership.
A:	I mean but where are they, where are they, what, what is their location, is it, uh, Asian or is it European or who,
M:	Um, it's, it, it was built by the same people who built the Toyota Camry.
A:	Oh, it is Japanese.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay,
M:	yeah, and I, I think, I,
A:	I didn't know.
M:	Yeah, they had a, uh, they, they put out a, a paper release on, uh on, on, you know, recycling of plastic, uh magazines.
A:	Uh-huh. Okay
M:	but, uh
A:	Yeah, I guess so that's true. Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	If, if, if I had the car I wanted.
M:	Uh-uh.
A:	Gee.
M:	Why not just pay the car insurance and, and, uh, that would be the easy way.
A:	Probably, um, uh, let's see, I like the looks of the Lincoln Town car
M:	Yeah.
A:	But I, I don't know the performance of it. That's a, Ford product,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and, you know, I would get hung up by my boot straps if I if I ever mentioned the Ford product in my family.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	And, uh, you would think that they would make quality products.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	Can I put you on hold for one minute?
M:	Sure.
A:	Thank you. Well, that was one minute. They hung up.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Um, well, the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car. Um, and the luxuries of a large car.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh, now color preferences, I think I would opt to go with a bronze. Which is probably closest to gold that you can get
M:	Uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	uh, I've had a lot of luck with ours. We've had, uh, a couple of ours fail. One of them was a little light, uh uh, uh a little dented piece of glass and the other one was a piece of tin, uh.
A:	Right, well, practical yes that's, Uh-huh. Right and it's cooler I believe, too, when you're driving in,
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	But the exterior is nice.
A:	Oh.
M:	And the, uh, the interior is just gorgeous. I don, I really like the look of it.
A:	Um, can you, uh, hang on again
M:	Sure.
A:	Thanks I've got the phones for lunch hour.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So. Just don't mind me if I bounce back and forth.
M:	Okay, well, I enjoyed talking to you.
A:	Um, so you like to listen to, uh, a lot of music, or do, is it talk shows.
M:	Yeah, I like to, listen to a lot, too.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I would rather listen to that than some of the other, uh radio, shows that, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	I don't, I don't like the classical music either.
A:	All the, yeah. Uh-huh. That's true.
M:	And, uh, so, uh.
A:	Do you listen Do you listen to W R R?
M:	No, I don't.
A:	Huh.
M:	Yeah, I, I like, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	I, I listen to K R L D. I, I used to listen to, uh, K L I F, uh the Monday Night Talk shows.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, it's, it, it was a really interesting, uh.
A:	Those are nice, aren't they? Yes, those are nice.
M:	Yeah, they are.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they're not perfect,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But they're fast.
A:	Huh.
