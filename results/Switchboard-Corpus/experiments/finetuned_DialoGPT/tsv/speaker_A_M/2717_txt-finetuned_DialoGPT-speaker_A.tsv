M:	Yeah
A:	and, uh, I've seen, uh, a lot of people get convicted, sentenced, and then just nothing happens,  just endless, endless, endless appeals.
M:	Right. Yeah, I think that's true.
A:	Yeah, what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years.
M:	I know.
A:	And, uh, here in Maryland I know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons, uh, just,
M:	Yeah
A:	Yeah, but I mean, in, here it's, uh, to the point where they were letting prisoners go. Uh, commuting the sentences of those that were in, in jail for lesser crimes,  in order to put more people in, into the jails.
M:	Right.
A:	And it was just, uh, amazing to me, and of course they made a big deal out of the, the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out,  and being rearrested an.
M:	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I, I don't know, I guess I don, I'm kind of, I think I'm, I can't really see the, uh the rehabilitation aspect of it.
A:	Uh, I can't remember. Refresh my memory.
M:	Well, I, I think it was, it was the, it's the, uh the one thing that, uh
A:	Um, I don't remember myself.
M:	Well, it was, it's, it really was a big political turn, uh
A:	Um, I think if they, if they started executing them on a regular basis, uh, that I think it might make a difference. Right now,  I don't see it making a difference.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death. I mean,  most people out there committing murders don't care.
M:	Yeah. That's true.
A:	They just don't care.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And so it's, you know, it becomes a double whammy.
A:	Yeah, yeah, and there's, uh, there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that, uh, have and we just had, uh, a real big cocaine bust, and of course, you know, they're, they're playing it up real big that it was, looked like it was a very, very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	But, I mean, uh, Baltimore has, uh, an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year. I think they've got over a hundred dead already this year.
M:	Wow.
A:	Well, it's kind of, it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it, it, it, uh, there's, I think, X number of people out there that are going to commit murders,
M:	Yeah,
A:	and, uh, once you kill off a few of them
M:	Yeah.
A:	I mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that, I mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!!,!!%!! Remind me of that, that's a good one.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I know that, uh you know there's a lot of things that I would like to see, uh. I think a lot, a lot more people would like a, a, you, you're, you want to say, uh I want to see if I can get along with this person, you have to be a good character and, and be a nice guy to, uh
A:	Yeah, you know, it makes sense, um, you know, you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused, but I mean, uh, so few and far between, uh, you know, makes good T V movies and that's about it.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know, I, I don, I just don't have a, a, uh a, you, I guess you could put it that way.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!!!!!,!! Remind me.
A:	Yeah, I had, my, uh, my father-in-law participated in a, uh, a jury trial, he was, he was actually on the jury,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, uh, this man was accused of killing, uh, I think it was two people, uh, and shooting a, uh, policeman, um, point blank in the face. Of course he didn't die.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	And, uh, this was during a holdup of a, uh, uh, a restaurant and it came out during the trial that, um, they had tried to rob another place and, uh, when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money, it turned out to be a couple cookies, and, uh, you know, jumbo cookies and, and so they were so upset from robbing this guy, you know, trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started, you know, shooting people.
M:	!!!;!!%!! translated!!?!! Auto!! Remind me.
A:	You know it's,
M:	and, and that was the second time that I had to go in and they were already telling me, you can't do this.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, and get even with who, I mean,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	you know, stupid guys And, uh, it turned out that the, you know, policeman survived to the point that he was able to, you know, identify the guy.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And of course, you know, they tried to make the cop look like he was, uh, a, uh, no good rotten drunk.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	I mean it was amazing.
M:	Well, that's, that is a, a frightening thought.
A:	Oh, he was found guilty, yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	He, uh, um, last I heard, he, uh, he beat a push for the death penalty. Now whether they finally got it or not, I don't know.
M:	Yeah, I know, I mean, I, I'm not real sure that, uh.
A:	I kind of, uh, stopped listening after a while.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Um, you know, he would come home and, and, you know, after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to you know, after he had to go,
M:	Okay.
A:	Right. And, uh, yeah everybody, everybody was pretty much, you know, let's burn him.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	And that's, you know, that's the way they wanted to do it. And he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he, uh, you know some people on the case were, were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but I mean when it all came down, they just, within an hour decided the man's fate.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	You know, I think that, you have a, you can have civil rights, but it's not equal to equal rights.
A:	Yeah, yeah, well, it, it, it went pretty, pretty quick from what he said.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I mean there's, there's, there's a lot of other crimes out there, I mean besides murder, I think, uh, now if you're dealing drugs now,  caught more than twice or something, uh,  it, there's, uh, a death penalty associated with it.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, you can't imagine that, you could, you couldn't imagine a, a, you, you're not a hero, you don't, you wouldn't be able to kill, uh
A:	Yeah, yeah, I agree.
M:	I, I, I don't know, I feel like, I'm not saying that it's right, but I think that, that, uh.
A:	Yeah, I agree, I, I've, I have, uh, a low tolerance for that kind of, uh, that kind of person. And, uh, as far as, uh, you know there are some, some other crimes that I think, uh, you know, uh, kidnapping, um, you know, when they, I mean kidnapping per se has a certain, uh, uh, fine and penalty associated with it,
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
A:	but, um, some of these people are just out and out brutal. I, some of the cases I've heard about over the years,
