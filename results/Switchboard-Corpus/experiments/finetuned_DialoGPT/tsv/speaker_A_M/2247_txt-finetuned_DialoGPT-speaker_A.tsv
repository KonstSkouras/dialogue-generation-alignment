M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, I think that's about where it is.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Uh, yeah, I do that, I, I do, uh, some Lotus on it. Uh, do some, uh, Samna, some, uh, P F M, uh, nothing extremely complex.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I have a P C at home and a terminal at work that I use all the time.
A:	Yep.
M:	So, I have a mix of, uh uh, a mix, uh of, of, you know, a P C, uh  and a P S one and a, uh P S two.
A:	Oh, yeah. I bet that's a pretty nice setup.
M:	Yeah. It is.
A:	Yep.
M:	But, uh, I have got, uh a, a, uh an eighty-seven Aries, which is, uh
A:	Wow.
M:	And so I'm trying to figure up how much is being spent on that.
A:	Yep.
M:	and, uh it just kept giving me errors, and I just decided that, that was the time to buy.
A:	Wow.
M:	I mean it was, it was a huge engine.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I'm a student.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's, it's really a great machine.
A:	Sure. Uh-huh.
M:	So, I'm very much for that.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	Have you tried using the free software that they have?
A:	Right.
M:	I've gotten to where I've bought most of my equipment at garage sales.
A:	Well, um, I seem to always be in the, the next to the last generation of word processing software. When everyone was in Samna I was still in P F M, and now that I finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect. So, I can never quite stay current with that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I don't know if you're familiar with that, but you just, you start with a, a, uh a small file, you know, you can go right down to the main frame, you don't have to go through a whole lot of extra work.
A:	Oh. Huh. I can I can believe that.
M:	But, uh.
A:	No, not really. I'm not that up be on that sort of thing.
M:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, well, it sounds like you're pretty much into computers.
M:	Yeah. I, I have a, a computer at home.
A:	I can believe that. Well, it's, it's been interesting.
M:	Yeah, it has been.
A:	Yeah, of course, needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I is, is that the newest thing now, the four eighty-six?
M:	Yeah.
A:	That, that must be a fairly recent release.
M:	I don't know, I, I don't remember seeing that.
A:	Okay, okay. Because I, I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes, but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
M:	Um.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	I mean, I, you know, I've, I was, I have worked in the, in the auto building, uh-hired people, uh
A:	Sure. Yeah.
M:	And, uh
A:	I did too, and you have a good day.
M:	You too.
A:	Bye-bye.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!! Auto attack.
