M:	Yeah, I have a Dodge Aries.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so, uh, I don't know, I'm not real sure that, uh that that's the way to go about selecting a car. I think you have to have a criteria that you can follow and, uh.
A:	I see
M:	Yeah.
A:	Top of, top of the line.
M:	Right.
A:	Oh.
M:	And then I'll get in the car and lock the door and try not to get out of it.
A:	Uh-huh. Right, right.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	I mean, they're not, you don't have to be conscious of them. You know, it, it's just a, just a part of being, you, you're not conscious of it.
A:	Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like power windows or power locks, because the people that I know who have them always seem to have trouble with them.
M:	Uh, uh.
A:	And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why it doesn't work
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-uh, yeah.
A:	And then I want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and I want an air bag and, uh, I guess,
M:	Sure, uh-huh.
A:	No, I haven't. Have you?
M:	I think I have.
A:	Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea
M:	Well, it's, it really is nice.
A:	Right.
M:	I mean, you, you can't deny that, but you can certainly,
A:	Right, that's a good idea.
M:	And, uh, I don't know, if, if they'd really make them mandatory, I think it would probably make a lot of sense to have them.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	So, I, I'm, I am not, I don't know if I would go that far, but, uh.
A:	Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands. I tend to have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically, you know, good repair record, good mileage, uh, and I needed air-conditioning and, uh, can't remember what my, oh, I wanted uh, stick shift. And, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice There was one car in all of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It, it turned out to be a, a Chrysler. Uh Lancer.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Yeah, it's, uh
A:	No, a five speed. And it, basically, it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it doesn't move.
M:	Yeah. Well, that's true.
A:	Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always had a car that had one and I thought it would be more reliable.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh,
M:	Well I guess, uh, my next car is going to be American because I have a Honda and I really like it.
A:	I found that out. I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me like, you must be crazy when I, went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,
M:	Well, that's true.
A:	So,
M:	Well, I've, I'm not sure if I've talked to anybody else in the eighties or not, but I've got to say that I think the last thing I did to a car was I bought a Dodge Caravan.
A:	Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore. At least in this area.
M:	Yeah, I don't know if it's, uh, is it, uh
A:	Not that I was looking for sports cars, but, now the people I've talked to don't seem to have stick shift.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And so why do you like stick shift?
M:	Well, it's not my favorite but it's something I do enjoy doing.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I have to keep track of what I'm putting in and what I, what I put in.
A:	Uh-huh. Right.
M:	And I like it where it's cold.
A:	Right, and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because it keeps you more active.
M:	Right.
A:	So,
M:	Yeah.
