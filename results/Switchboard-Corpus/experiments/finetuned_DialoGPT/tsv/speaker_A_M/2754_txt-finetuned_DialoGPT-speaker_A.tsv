M:	so I guess I'm kind of, uh. I don, I, uh I donno, I guess you'd call it a deterrent, but I don tinker with it too much. Uh, you, you would think that, that the person who commits the crime would have some kind of remorse for what they did, uh
A:	Uh, I believe in it, too
M:	Yeah. Well, I, uh
A:	I'm Catholic and we're not supposed to, but, uh, I feel that it, like you, you know, on the premeditated murders I feel if you're, you know, I mean, if it's beyond a doubt that you did it, you know I would say go ahead and execute that person as well.
M:	Uh.
A:	But, it's the cases, you know, like sometimes you, you know, you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely, you know, they really didn't do it. Well, you know, you, you got, you got that point well, you know, what, what if a mistake is made and you put someone, you know, to death that really didn't do it.
M:	Yeah.
A:	There's always that chance, I don't know, but, I would say that, you know, for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated, it would be kind of hard for, you know,
M:	Right.
A:	You know what I'm saying? Like,
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!!;!!!!!That's right!! You know!!You!!Yeah!!I!!Okay!!What!!?!! LINE!!Did!!And!!

A:	Yeah.
M:	If, if they didn't have that overwhelming evidence, it might not convict them.
A:	So, uh, I,
M:	I don't know, I don't, I mean, I know that, that, you know, like the, uh the, the trial by jury in the, in, in the United States, I think, I'm not sure how it would work in England, but I know in England there's a, uh you know there's sort of a, sort of, you have one person who's appointed to, you, you can't have more than one person, you don't have to be unanimous.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Exactly. Uh, I'm not sure about Pennsylvania, whether we have it or not. For some reason I was thinking that we do, but it's, you know, it's not very often. I think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that, that anyone anyone from Pennsylvania had gotten it.
M:	Uh, well, I was, I had not heard that.
A:	I don't, do you know if Virginia has it?
M:	No, I, I haven't heard of it. I know, I was just thinking of, uh, the, uh the, the Pennsylvania, uh state, uh-hockey, I think it's called.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think they just got it out.
A:	I know Florida has it.
M:	No.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh, you know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. But it's funny that, uh, I mean, like, you know, like I said I think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for Pennsylvania. I'm not even sure of that, but for some reason I think that, you know, it was something like that. And, it surprised, and even Florida, I know they have it, and you don't really hear about it real often, how many people,
M:	Uh-uh.
A:	Yeah, but, you, you think that, I mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed,  you know, compared to that and to how many people are being sent, that doesn't seem like very many.
M:	Well I, I,  I think, you can see it in the, in the society, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, you don t have to be convicted of a certain crime and you can't be, you can be sentenced to death, but you can only be sentenced once.
A:	Everyone would appeal. That's true, too.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.!!;!!!,!!You!!Oh!!I!!That!!?!!Holy!!
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you're right, there's no way that you can ever catch those guys
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	And then they, they have a waiting period, and they have all the information, you can find out about your license and everything.
A:	Yeah, uh-huh.
M:	So, you see a lot of, a lot more men, a a lot, uh in the media and, and, uh.
A:	And then they get out.
M:	and, and they, and, and then, you see them in the headlines, you never know who they're, you don't know who to believe them.
A:	Yeah, they get out in three years on probation,
M:	Yeah.
A:	and they do it again, you know.
M:	Well, that's true. That's true, that is true.
A:	It's like a slap on the fingers for them.
M:	Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's just, I don't know. I donno.
A:	I don't, I don't, I don't, I think that it should be, I mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone, a murder, then I think, you know, that they should likewise, you know, someone should take their life also. But, uh, but, are, are you, would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder?
M:	Uh, I, I would probably say yes. I think there should be some controls against it, and, uh I, and I, there should also be some control against it if it, if it does happen. Uh, I also think that there should definitely be some penalties for people who commit certain crimes, such as rape, uh
A:	Yeah.
M:	Because I think the way the trial by jury was set up was to make sure that, uh that, that, you, you knew that, yes, you're guilty, you can be, you've been charged with a crime, and you can't, you don't have to give up your right to continue living with your crime.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah.
M:	And, and, and I don, I don think they have the right to do that, because, you, you have to go through, you've got to get people that are, you can't just, you don't have to be the most hardened and, uh you know.
A:	I think some of them would rather be in jail
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah. They probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, I guess, I don't know. I, I, you know, I've, I have a hard time thinking that, uh you know it's a, it's not a problem anymore, it, it seems like there's been a lot of, you can't say that it's, it just hasn't been a problem for a very long time.
A:	I don't know, uh, I was just going to say something, I forgot what it was. Oh, I don't even remember what it was now.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	In Clarion. Well, I live in Butler, but I'm at I'm at college. I'm at Clarion University.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah
M:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh. See, yeah, okay, well, see, I'm, I'm in kind, I'm in kind, okay, uh, we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus.
M:	Uh, okay
A:	Yeah, and that would be pushing it. So, I mean this is definitely a college town. Uh, we're about two hours north of Pittsburgh if that would help you out any. Uh,
M:	Yeah.
A:	North of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
M:	Okay.
A:	Oh, I've never heard of Polk but,
M:	Okay, I'm in Garland.
A:	Oh, I never heard of that.
M:	Yeah, so,
A:	It might have a new name.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	We're probably about an hour away from Sharon.
M:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh, so, I, most of the kids here, I, you know, like, you know, just from dorm mates and stuff, they'll say that they don't believe in it, but then after I would say my point of view, then they'll say, well, yeah, you know, you know.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah. You know, I think people can be persuaded one way or another. I've never seriously ran into someone, I mean like, other than my priest, you know, who definitely says you can't take a, you know, you can't take anyone's life. Uh, anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, you don't hear, you, you hear stories about people that are, you're sure they're guilty.
A:	yeah Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, and I think, you, you have to have the, you need to have some background on it,  you know.
A:	Yeah,
M:	So, I, I think that, that there's, there, there is a, a double standard in, in the courts.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. That's something, you know but, uh, whether they plea bargain or not, if they're guilty of murder, they're guilty of murder, you know.
M:	Well, I mean, the guy's, you're right, he's not going to get off the street for a year or two.
A:	So I don't think that they deserve anything less
M:	No, that seems rather shortsighted.
A:	It's just, I don't, I don't know, I just
M:	I think that, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, and that costs money, yeah.
M:	And,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I'm not sure that, that we have the right solution to it.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
