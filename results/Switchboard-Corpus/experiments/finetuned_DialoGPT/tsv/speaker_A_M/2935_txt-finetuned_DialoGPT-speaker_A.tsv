M:	And we had to cut down our garden, because we were afraid of the blackening, and it was getting so hot, and so we were going to have to put up all our blackening mounds, and then we were trying to get out of that, and that was, that was the worst part of it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh
A:	Do you have a lawn?
M:	Yeah, we do, uh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	so.
A:	Well, um, actually it, we've sort of had an ideal Spring.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and the roses have been blooming for two weeks, and the grass is, uh, this lush green, and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.
M:	Oh.
A:	But, um, you know, I just keep looking at, and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.
M:	Right.
A:	But, and my garden, you know, my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	the plants and,
M:	I love tomatoes. I love tomatoes
A:	you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know, we'll have a freeze.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, that's it. Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January, and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it, and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then, you know, everything just got hit hard
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	So, but yeah, it, it's interesting, and I enjoy gardening. My son does the mowing of the grass.
M:	Oh.
A:	I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.
M:	Well, it was, it really was, because it was so, it just, it made it so much more difficult for us.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh and, and so, and, you can tell that, that, you're not just mowing the lawn, you, you've done a good job of, of, uh uh, mowing your own lawn.
A:	Oh, they help you.
M:	and so, I mean, they're, they are a lot of energy to put into it, and, and they, you can't, you don't, I can't put too much in it
A:	Oh dear. Oh but that's nice, you know, I mean the peach tree is, is a start and,
M:	Well, we, we have one in the house and I know that when the first one was born it was, you knew, it was going to be gone before we could put it in,
A:	Right. What about tomatoes, aren't they pretty hardy?
M:	Yes, they are, very hardy, but they're very colorful, and they're, they're also very hard to take care of.
A:	Oh.
M:	I mean, we just, we're so accustomed to it now, we don tinker around with it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we tried, we tried it, and we didn't realize it, but we had to pull all the, all the roots out and put them in the ground.
A:	Oh.
M:	and, and it's really worked out so far.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	you know, it's just that the water around your house is so polluted that, uh, you're, you know, you don, you can't, you, you have to be careful not to have your plants, um, filtered, because it's, it is a very dirty, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, you're like, I'll start again.
A:	Well, I would assume, too, I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Oh, dear.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Sounds like it would have been pretty.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, sure, sure.
M:	So, I'm not real sure what the size of our house is, but we're, we're at, we've got two bedrooms, and two-thirds, and, uh, so it's, it's kind of, it seems to me, it would fit in, you know,
A:	Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list, but it's not off the list.
M:	No, no.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I don't know, it just, it seems to me like it's so relaxing to just, just go out and do it.
A:	Oh.
M:	and it was a, it was an experience I had not, I had never been to Florida.
A:	Right. Maybe next year they'll do better.
M:	Yeah, I'm sure they will.
A:	Okay, well, thanks.
M:	Bye-bye.
A:	It was nice talking to you too. Bye-bye.
