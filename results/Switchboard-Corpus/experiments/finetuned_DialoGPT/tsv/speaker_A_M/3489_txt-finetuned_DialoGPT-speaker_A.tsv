M:	I think that's, uh.
A:	How about your community?
M:	Well, it's a, it is a small community, but it's, uh it's fairly large and it's not a total, you know, it, it does have some recycling centers and things like that. Uh.
A:	Dye Mound?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Yeah, it's in the Plano area.
A:	Sounds like a place where I grew up
M:	Yeah, uh-hope so,
A:	Well, I like it.
M:	But I'm, I, I don't know, I just don't think it's as, it's, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	It's a little more difficult to drive, but it's, it is a lot of fun.
A:	Well, good.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Oh, okay.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh.
M:	It will, uh.
A:	Well, let's hope not. You can be, uh, get in trouble for that.
M:	I'm sure it will.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then, uh you, you, uh put the, uh in the middle of the bridge and, and then you, put the concrete under it and then, you put the slab under it.
A:	Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Okay, okay.
M:	I'm, I'm from the, uh, I was born and raised in Texas, so I know a little bit about Texas politics.
A:	Yes, until you release it.
M:	And then you put it in there, and it's like, uh, oh, this is going to work.
A:	All right.
M:	So, uh, what are your favorite shows?
A:	I think, Yes.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh, yes, I sure do.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, you know, it's like, it, it really is, I mean, you, you don't have to, you just don't even have to go out and buy it.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh.
M:	And I don't know why, why I don tinker with it.
A:	Yes.
M:	And, uh
A:	No.
M:	I don't, I donno what the solution is to that.
A:	Well, great. That's excellent.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. That's a great idea. I hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that. One thing,
M:	Well we're, we're doing that. We're doing it in all the schools, too, so.

A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, and I think that that's one of the reasons that we're so cheap.
A:	Yes, they will.
M:	And I think that's a, that's, that is a big problem. I think it's a big, uh
A:	Exactly.
M:	So, I don't know. I think we've been lucky. I've had, uh, two boys through so far, and, uh  they've both been real picky about things.
