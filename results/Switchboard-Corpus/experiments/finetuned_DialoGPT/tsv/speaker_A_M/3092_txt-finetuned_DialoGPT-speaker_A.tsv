M:	I have not. I wish I did.
A:	Yes, uh-huh.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Okay, well, yes I do.
M:	Okay.
A:	In fact, I am at work right now. Uh, and so let me take the lead, uh, Angela. Uh, I think what is really important, uh, of course, salary is very important, because that's why you are working for your, for the money, but, job satisfaction to me is also, uh, very important in having a job. And, uh, one of the things that, uh, she asked us to discuss was benefits. Uh, I'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you.
M:	Right.
A:	Okay. And so we could, we could talk about, uh, that path, you know, how important you think his benefits are. And, and, and, uh, how important you think they are and if, what would you like to see increased in his benefits.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Like, uh, perhaps, uh, he has, uh, the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family, uh, uh, and how much coverage, uh, it provides and also, your hospital coverage, and, uh, um, probably dental. How important you think that would be.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Because they, of course, if you did not have them, you would be pulling from your salary, of course.
M:	Well, I, yeah, I do. I'm, I'm a, I work in a hospital and, um I work for the government, and so I, uh
A:	Right,
M:	uh, but you would still be making twice as much as your, uh your, when you retired from the company.
A:	right.
M:	That's the way I am. I don't have to worry about, you know, if I go out to eat or something I don tinker with it.
A:	And they always have surprises for you.
M:	and,
A:	With children,
M:	Right.
A:	You know, and so, it's, it is, uh, we could not do without the benefit package from, from any company that we worked for, whether they be a conglomerate or just a small, uh, uh, business.
M:	Right.
A:	You would still have something.
M:	Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
A:	Right.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Yes. Uh-huh. They are getting a handle on that, in fact, uh, my oldest daughter is, uh, is uh, a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on. To have, uh, uh, a day care center for the the children of the, of the nurses that are staffing the facility.
M:	Uh-hauhuh, uh-hue.
A:	And that is true in many, many areas of, you know, uh, job titles and professions.
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	Uh-huh. Sure. Would, it would, It would be just futile.
M:	Yes. And I think, uh.
A:	And they would not have the quality,
M:	Right.
A:	And they,  would be deprived of their mother.
M:	Uh-uh.
A:	Yeah. No, I understand that totally
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, I hear , Yes, that's true.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Right.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and if they had been in the building longer, you know, they would have seen it coming.
A:	Yes. Do you, Do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit, if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting? Do you think that would be, acceptable?
M:	Well, no, I think that, uh, I would be more in favor of, uh you know if we could get something done about it but, uh I don't know.
A:	I do too.
M:	Because, I mean, they're not, they have too much of a responsibility.
A:	Right, that you, Right. That's right.
M:	So, uh,
A:	With the company than,  than having to go, That's , that's right. Yes, I, agree with that.
M:	!!!!,!!That's right, you're right. That would be a lot cheaper.
A:	That would be fair.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So,
A:	Uh, and how, how do you feel about, uh, let's see, eye care?
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Okay.
M:	But I do know that there are some companies that are doing it and, and, uh.
A:	Vision, I guess it's called, vision care.
M:	Yeah.
A:	It depends on who examines your eyes.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	If you have an, an optometrist or an ophthalmologist, there's a vast difference in those two, uh, professionals.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Glaucoma.
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	Oh. Oh, okay, so,
M:	And, and so, you know, she, she thinks that, you, you can go to a doctor and get blood pressure medicine,
A:	Yes.
M:	and she is just, she just loves it.
A:	Uh-huh. Yes, they are.
M:	And I think, you know, the, the costuming and everything, I think it's about twenty-five dollars.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, she has, uh she has had to have a, a private sitter,
A:	Right, that's critical, because she's in need of it so often.
M:	Right. Right.
A:	Yes, and, you know, we have, uh, needs in our life that are unique to us and, uh, you know, people have needs in their life that unique to us, to them.
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
A:	I mean, we are all different so,
M:	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A:	Well, no that's my other phone.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	So, that's it that's okay, my, that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation,
M:	Oh, no
A:	so, it's okay.
M:	Okay, um, I don't know, I think we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women, in the work place, in today's work place and, um.
A:	Uh-huh. That's very expensive.
M:	but, but it's, it, it is expensive, and it's really,
A:	Yes, that's true. Orthodontic work is terribly expensive.
M:	And, uh, so I don't know, I, I'm, I guess I'm biased because I'm a, a medical doctor and so I've seen some things that are just, you know, over priced, over thought,
A:	Especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth, and, and you have to really get them when they are young, in order to have, uh, not, uh, a decent smile when they are fifteen, sixteen years old.
M:	Uh-uh. Right. Right, uh-hue.
A:	I know, two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight, uh, because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth.
M:	Oh.
A:	And we footed the bill, because there was not any such thing and when they were young.
M:	Right.
A:	Oh, uh-huh.
M:	So he needed a dentist to pull him up. And the orthodony was not good. He needed a, uh a private orthopedist to pull the dental away from him.
A:	Uh-huh, major.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Well, I guess I'll let him go.
A:	Well, I tell you I, I just read an article in the paper about what they are doing, I think it was an ad in, in our publication at Texas Instruments, where they are breaking the jaw and, and lining the jaw up with the teeth.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	It's, it's less painful and less expensive.
M:	Uh-oh, that's good.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	I, I know, but it, it's, it's, uh, easier on the patient in the long run, which amazed me.
M:	Uh-huh.
