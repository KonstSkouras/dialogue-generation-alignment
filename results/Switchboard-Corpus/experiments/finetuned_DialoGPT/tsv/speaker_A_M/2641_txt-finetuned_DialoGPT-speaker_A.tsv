M:	Oh.
A:	so, I mean, I'm used, I'm used to having cats around, I like them.
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Oh, see, I'm not, uh, I'm not a dog person at all
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, probably, I was allergic to dogs when I was a kid, in fact,
M:	Yeah.
A:	I may still be, um, we,
M:	Well, I, I have a dog, and I, you know, we went out and bought him, and he was part Springer Spaniel, part Cocker Spaniel.
A:	That , um, I wonder sometimes
M:	Well, I don't know, I, I have a friend who has a dog and, uh, he's always had dogs,
A:	Um, but we, um, we house sat for a, um, my, um, my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and, um, uh, he has a dog and everything, we were, you know, we were sitting the dog and everything and, uh, I felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday, it was like, hey, maybe you're still allergic to the dog. It was like, oh, that could be it.
M:	Oh, no.
A:	Yeah. Well, dogs are real high maintenances, you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot, you know, you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing.
M:	No, it's, it really isn't.
A:	Um, and, um, um, you know, it's, it's just nice that cats, you know, cats, yeah, you don't have to let them outside, you know, all cats are indoor cats,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so, you know, they're not, you're not worried about them running all-around the neighborhood and, you know, they, you know, they, they make their mess in the cat pan which is,
M:	Yeah.
A:	yeah, it's, you know, it's a pain to clean but, you know, we used to, I mean, they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans . They didn't,
M:	No, I, I'm not sure if I would consider that a hobby.
A:	Well, when I was, you know, when I was growing up I had a clean the cat pan all the time, and I hated it because I had to carry everything upstairs and, you know, and use this thing to, you know, scoop the, take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible. But now they have like this, you get these liners, that is garbage bags, you know,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and you, and you, you know the,
M:	And the, and the people, and it's just, it, you don't even know what it is, you just, you have to wonder if it's some sort of, uh, some sort, uh-hive, uh uh, uh you know for, for, uh
A:	Yeah, the cats do it in there, you pull it and take it out and throw it away, and that's it,
M:	I've got a, I've got two cats now, and they're both about the same age.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we had a, a cat, um, who was, uh, about eight years old, and she would sleep in the back of the house with us,
A:	Same idea
M:	Uh, and it was a lot of fun, but I was also trying to figure out, you know, how to get rid of the, the, uh, sticky buns, and, and the, and all the little things that, that we have to peel for the, to open the can.
A:	Everyday?
M:	and it was, it was a very dirty pan,
A:	Oh, okay, I see.
M:	And so, I guess I, I think that's the only thing I can really complain about about is, uh, the service charge. I don't know if it's just a part of it, but, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it would have killed the cat, but it was so worth it.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, she's, she has a real fear about cucumbers, cucumbers because she says that they're just too hard, she doesn't want to eat them.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And so she has put in a lot of work and, and he's been an excellent dog.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So,
A:	So, you don't have anything right now?
M:	No, not right now.
A:	Oh, except the kid, huh, that's ,
M:	Yeah, so.
A:	Uh, I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much, um, yeah, we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out,
M:	Oh.
A:	and, um, uh, it's not a big deal really, I mean they're, they're happier when we're around but, you know, they, they're pretty much okay by themselves, um, and I don't, you know, we couldn't do that with a dog.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well , that's, That's, um, pampering the, the petals
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then, you, you had to go out and mow the grass,
A:	But they're not that much fun, you know, you can't take them for a walk, you can't, you know, they, they don't, they can't fetch, you know,
M:	Yeah.
A:	they they can't do anything, so I've never, I think we had fish when I was a kid but I don't,
M:	Oh, I've heard of them.
A:	Oh.
M:	and it was like, it was about eleven or twelve feet long, and he jumped out and jumped right into it.
A:	Oh.
M:	And it was a, it was, it, it looked like it was the same color as the one that my mother made.
A:	Oh.
M:	But, um.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	so we just took our dog in and he was just, it was just too much.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And we had to get rid of all of the barns that were there, and the barn was empty, and we couldn't get out there and we were trying to get out the, the, uh, the drag net out and we tried to get back out and the, and then we couldn tinker with that and we ended up having to get all the drag out of the dragnet, and that was, that was a, that's a part of the problem, you know, we had all the barn space in the house, but we had no room for dragNET.
A:	No, it's like, I just, I don't know, I, I just never understood why, what the attraction, I mean, they're, you know, they're pretty and everything but I've just never seen the attraction of having fish. It's not as much fun.
M:	Well, they, they have to be, they just have to get used to each other, I guess.
A:	an eel?
M:	an elk.
A:	Oh, now we really get sick
M:	Yeah, but they're not too bad.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh, we've had some pretty nice weather down there.
A:	Like, I remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha, and, uh, you know, used to drop mice in
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	this is not, these aren't cats, you know,
M:	Oh, really.
A:	this is gross.
M:	I know.
A:	Yep.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah, well,
M:	But, uh, I don't know, I think, uh.
A:	Yeah, well, a cat will do the same trick
M:	Yeah.
A:	I had a friend in I had a friend in college who had a, um, had a pet rat for a while.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Um, I forget how she got it, but it was, um, it was the same kind of a deal I think she got it, I think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	Whoops
M:	so I don know, but, I guess I, I, my pet peeve with magazines is, I find them to be very formula oriented, and I think that's one of the reasons that they've gone downhill the last few years, but they're, they're still around,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I said, well, you can't do that, I'm sorry.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, um.
A:	Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts, so .
M:	Well, I, I think, I'm not sure how much of that is, uh, you, you have to do with the, the social changes that have occurred, uh.
A:	Yeah, rats are not my favorite animals in the world, but I could see getting one from birth and everything.
M:	Well, we, we have a dog now and we, uh, we found her about a year ago and, uh we took her home and she had picked up a ham and it was the strangest thing, she was a hamster.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and,
A:	Yeah, I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they, they tell me the same thing.
M:	Well, they,
A:	I just, again it gets into vivant much fun, you know what, I guess they can be. I,
M:	I know.
A:	Okay.
M:	And, um.
A:	Right.
M:	but it's very much possible to have one without a lot of, of these, you don't have to be a certain income holder to have pets.
A:	Oh people,
M:	yeah, people have pets now.
A:	I don't, oh, plus, I mean, the pooper scooper one New York, so, you know .
M:	Yeah, well, that's, that, that is a good point. I, I'm not sure how, how the New York system fits into it, but I know that the, the, uh, the New Jersey school system, uh
A:	Yeah, uh , I was living in northern Jersey when that law came through, remember hearing all about it,
M:	Yeah.
A:	we were wondering if they, uh, they had any special law for the horses in Central Park.
M:	Oh.
A:	Of course, not.
M:	No.
A:	Hit the bags.
M:	but they, they've got these little, you know, like two little, two little shines, and one big frying pan.
A:	Oh, God, I can't, Haven't been up there, last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad
M:	Oh.
A:	Not this past fall but I mean fall, a few years, I mean, it it was in the, yeah, it was almost like October of eighty-five,
M:	Oh.
A:	I think was the last time I was up, up there and at Center Park.
M:	Uh, that sounds like a good plan.
A:	Um, I had a friend who went to Colombia and I used to go up and visit her.
M:	Oh, that's where I live, too.
A:	Um, so,
M:	Well, I think, I, I'm thinking about going to Europe in the fall.
A:	No, they're just mutts,
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	yeah, my wife got them from, uh, um, friend of hers at work and everything, you know, you know, as kittens,
M:	Oh.
A:	and it was before, I mean, this was before we even met. Um, she's had them for a couple years. And um, you know, they're really cute, they're, they're sisters,
M:	Oh.
A:	one of them is a lot bigger than the other one and, she pushes the other one away from the food. Apparently I don't know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	You know, the
M:	Uh, now I don, I don t remember what they were, what they look like.
A:	both, yeah, both females, they're both spayed, um, or whatever it is, neutered, you know, um,
M:	Uh, so, uh, what do you think about, uh what do, what about the, what, what are the opinions on capital punishment?
A:	and they're, they're both declawed at least on the, the front claws.
M:	Oh, really?
