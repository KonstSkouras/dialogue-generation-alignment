M:	Yeah.
A:	I got a friend who goes there, by the way I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay.
M:	Yeah. Well, I have a friend that goes to Tech also, and, uh she goes to, uh the, uh to the University of Small Town, which is in Wichita Falls. And, uh I mean, I, I don't know, I've heard about it, but I haven't heard about the program.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. was a, a, it's more or less a suburban school system?
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yes. That, that was true for mine too. Uh, although I I'm sure to some extent, that money is part of the problem in the disparity, but I don't think, I honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it. You know, I  think that, uh, I mean I know that in my town, you know, most of the, most of the parents, they're valued education.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh  you know, and so the students were, you know, to some extent, motivated to learn.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	I mean  know
M:	You know,
A:	Yeah, that's true. But but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read you know?  Which it I mean it sounds like, uh,
M:	Yeah
A:	now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have of these, uh, sort of mandatory tests if you have to take before you get  a diploma.
M:	Yeah
A:	But, uh, but, uh, certainly before that, there were people that, you know, would graduate from high school and could barely read. Uh, and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really, I, I, I mean I just can't even picture how that could happen. You know, except maybe to someone whose, you know, really badly learning, uh, disabled or something.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But these people obviously weren't.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	and I'm sure that, uh...
A:	Yeah. And I think that's almost a bigger factor, than anything else probably. I mean, I don't, I think you know, people just,
M:	Yeah, well, I, I mean I don tinker with drugs, but I, uh I do, uh
A:	Yeah. And, again, I don't, I mean got know the, you know, how qualified, I mean, I think it'd be interesting to, you know, to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school. Uh, you know, sort, sort of maybe from elementary through, uh, high school.  You know, just sort of to get a feel for what it's like.
M:	Uh-huh. Uh-hue.
A:	I think that'd be an interesting experience. But, uh, I haven't done that
M:	Yeah, I, I've heard of it.
A:	But I do, I do think that, uh, I mean, public education in general I think can work. And I think it's a good thing.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I'm not sure how well that is.
A:	Yes.
M:	And they could have had a lot more money.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in. mean
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I don, I think, I'd like to see them, I wish they'd start with, you, first of all you get into the, uh public schools, and then you get to the private ones.
A:	Yeah. I mean, and and in the, once you junior high, uh, start junior high, starting in eighth grade all the way through high school, there were four levels. Well, no, I guess it in junior high, it was still three. Then in high school it changed into four levels of, uh, of instruction in the major subjects. Uh, which,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, actually I think that works pretty well. and that, that makes,
