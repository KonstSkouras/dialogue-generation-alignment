M:	Huh.
A:	Huh.
M:	I mean, we had one child that I was going to school with that I had never even met before, and, and he was the best, uh child care provider I've ever had in my life.
A:	Huh.
M:	But, uh
A:	Oh, well that's interesting.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, my God.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!!ets!!;!! FUN!!
A:	Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, well, yeah
M:	So, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I, I felt very strong about it. But, uh.
A:	Well, not, not all of us. You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for. I'm an engineer.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	And,
M:	I think, I think they're, they're a lot better than T I.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh we had, uh a, a couple of dorms that were like, uh one was a biology building, one was, uh the biology building and one was the nursing building and then the science building,
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh and then, of course, you know, there's also the fact that, uh.
A:	Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.
M:	And they, they didn't learn anything.
A:	That's incredible.
M:	But, uh, you know, we had, uh  a friend of ours who was teaching for a while and, uh she was paid, well, actually I think she was twice a week
A:	Oh, oh.
M:	So, yeah, we, we were real lucky because, um, my husband and I both work and, um.
A:	Well.
M:	so I'm not sure what I would do without them.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and,
A:	You know, they could, somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know, that's a good starting wage
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.
M:	Right.
A:	Huh.
M:	and I think that's probably a big problem.
A:	I mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit. But mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven so you know, that,
M:	Oh, my goodness.
A:	I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?
M:	Yeah, it's five dollars.
A:	Oh my.
M:	And they just, you know.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh, yeah.
