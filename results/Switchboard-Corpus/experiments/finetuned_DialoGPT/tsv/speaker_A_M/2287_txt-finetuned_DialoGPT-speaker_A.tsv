M:	I, I, I didn't vote in that one, but I, uh.
A:	Yeah, you're not sure where to go and vote and all that.
M:	Well, it's a, it is a state law that you have to register as a gun owner and you have a gun.
A:	Right, or you don't know what they you know, where they stand or anything like that.
M:	Uh-hope not.
A:	Yeah, I think you're right.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah, or sometimes they don't like either of the choices for the candidates,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	so they think, well, you know, why vote.
M:	Right, right. And, and, and I think that's really, I don't know, that's, that, that I think, uh, I, I kind of get a kick out of that sometimes.
A:	Yeah, really, especially in Texas
M:	Yeah.
A:	It really was, yeah.
M:	Well, I'm glad to hear that, because that's, that's a really important aspect of education.
A:	Yeah Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
M:	Well, I donno, I really don't,
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah. It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected.
M:	Right, right.
A:	Kind of scary when you think about that.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, gosh.
M:	And he's a, uh a black guy that, that's, that I know is, you know, sort of a closet fascist.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah, people will sit home and assume, oh, that guy would never get elected.
M:	Right.
A:	Next thing you know, you've got him.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, um, I don't know.
A:	Right, yeah.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah. Right.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Yeah, he sure did.
M:	He sure did, and then, um.
A:	Yeah. I think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days, or you could mail it in, or something like, if you have, if you have real strict work hours, and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long
M:	Yeah
A:	I think that discourages a lot of people.
M:	!!!%
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and then we have a plan where, uh  we vote on the local mayor
A:	Right.
M:	but you have to register and, and vote. And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, it's, it, it really is a good thing.
A:	Yeah, I'm in Dallas, and they're long here too.
M:	Oh, they are.
A:	Yeah, I voted absentee one year. I really was going to be gone. So, I did it, but, uh, it was nice. I would be tempted to do it again.
M:	Well, it, it is interesting though, because I was, uh  thinking about that the other day, uh
A:	Right.
M:	you can just go right ahead and get it.
A:	Yeah. I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
M:	Yeah,
A:	I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
M:	Right. That's true.
A:	Uh-huh,
M:	and I think that's what really works the best. I, I don't know how the voting is done, but I think it's done by more informed people. I don tinker with the details. I'm not sure how it's run.
A:	Yeah, that would be. I usually vote. A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,
M:	Uh, well I've, I have a couple of parties that I vote on. Uh, one of them is a woman, and one of the others is a man, and I, I think I, uh think I like the idea of, uh
A:	so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote.
M:	Well, that's good.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, and, uh.
A:	No, I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
M:	Yeah, well, I do, I have, uh
A:	Right, and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, and I, I,
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Yeah.
M:	and I think that's one of the frustrating things.
A:	Yeah, I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Oh, yeah.
M:	And then it's like, oh, no, no.
A:	Yeah, the press has a lot of power.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Yeah, oh, but, boy you try get into that, you'd really open a can of worms.
M:	Oh, I know.
A:	Yeah, seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit, and I don't think they ever care to.
M:	Well, I think that, I mean, I, uh, I guess I agree that, uh the, the, I don, I'm not sure, I can't think of a, a good example, I've heard of, uh, oh, well, what do you call it? The, uh
A:	Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it was good talking to you.
M:	Okay, bye-bye.
A:	Bye.
M:	!!!%!! RemindMe!!
