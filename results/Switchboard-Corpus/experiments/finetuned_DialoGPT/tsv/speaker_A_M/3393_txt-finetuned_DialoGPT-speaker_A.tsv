M:	And, uh.
A:	Andrews?
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry.
M:	Uh, I haven't had that problem either.
A:	Um, September really was, I'm not sure about October. I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer.
M:	Uh, oh, really?
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	We've had some really nice weather.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it's been so hot, and, and it's just been so dry.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	we had a lot of flooding,
A:	Oh, if you had it early.
M:	Yeah, it was. It was, uh
A:	Yeah, I think we usually have a frost in October.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	Uh, but, you know. We really need the rain that we've been getting, and it has not today, but the last few days it's been, been pouring most of the day.
M:	!!!% Well, I know, I, I've been in Texas for the last three years, and I know that we had, uh, a freeze down to about forty-two degrees.
A:	Flooding anywhere. I have not heard of it, any problems of it flooding anywhere, I mean, that's occurred certainly at times in the past, but, uh, no, I've not heard of any particular problems this time.
M:	!!!;!!%!! Remind me of that happening, because I know we've had some, uh.
A:	Yes.
M:	and then we went out to dinner on a Saturday morning, and we had a ball.
A:	Yes, yeah, we had summer lasting long and then it, then it, then it became winter like, uh today it's, today it's sort of change to warmer to sort of more typical autumn day.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	but, uh.
A:	I don't know. Yeah, our leaves are, are all on, on the ground now. I think it was an especially good winter for fall colors.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah, yeah.
M:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	Yeah, we, we did, for a time.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I've never had to drive in Texas.
A:	Been that this year for the trees for the leaves.
M:	Yes.
A:	Um.
M:	And, uh, we were down in Texas, and it was about a week before Christmas, and so we were, it was, it had been probably about three weeks before Christmas we had to cut some trees down.
A:	Yeah, that's because it, it can't tolerate a freeze this early. Is that right?
M:	Yeah it's really funny.
A:	If it would came later it would be all right?
M:	I don't know, I'm not really sure what the answer is.
A:	Um.
M:	I, I, I don't know. I,
