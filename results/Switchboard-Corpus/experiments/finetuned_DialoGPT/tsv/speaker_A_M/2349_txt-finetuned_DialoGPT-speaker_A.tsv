A:	Yes, all, all young Americans, they did not specify, you know, exactly what young means.
M:	Right.
A:	Yeah.
M:	It's, it's, uh, it is not a, not a very long program.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's right. That, that would be the problem. Sure would.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, or maybe offer them, you know, some sort of an incentive to do it. Uh, you know college credit, you know, something, you know,
M:	Yeah
A:	I'm not sure what but,
M:	Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child, uh, to choose between college and, and a college that does accept a certain amount of credits?
A:	I'm not sure they need to be, you know, paid, you know, a super do salary of any kind.
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	but that, that kind of takes away from public service.
M:	Yeah.
A:	But, just, you know, to receive a letter in the mail, that says, you know, you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday, you know. I'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm not either really.
M:	so I don know, I, I just, I'm, I guess I'm cynical about it, but, uh,
A:	That's right.
M:	!!!!,!!!'!!You know, I mean, I, I've got a couple of hundred dollars that I'm going to use for, you, you're right. I just don't have the time to spend that kind of time with it.
A:	That's right.
M:	it's, it's, uh, you really have to be very careful and watch what you buy, because you can make a lot, you don't want to make four thousand dollars, you want to spend three hundred and fifty dollars,
A:	Uh-huh. That's right. Absolutely. They need, young families, whatever,
M:	Yeah.
A:	they just couldn't, you know, take off to do that.
M:	Right.
A:	Oh,
M:	and, uh,
A:	That's right, uh-huh.
M:	and they're not going to be able to afford to pay for it.
A:	Uh-huh, it sure would. It would have to be a lot of, you know, thought given to something like that, I would think.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, uh, you're right, there's, there is so much going on that it's almost overwhelming sometimes.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	I think that's, that's a good idea. I don't know, it, it's, it seems to me that, that, um, um.
A:	That's right. I'm not even really sure at this point in time, you know, what, what programs are out there.
M:	Uh-uh. Well, I'm sure they're still working on that.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	and I think that's a good idea.
A:	Yeah.
M:	!!!%!!!!! Remind me of that, now that's a good show.
A:	Yeah, like maybe if, if there was something they could do in their own, own, in their own town or city, yeah, and not have to pull up roots and, you know, go somewhere half way around the world, or something.
M:	Uh-uh. Yeah.
A:	That's right. Yeah, that's, that's true too. That's true too.
M:	but, uh,
A:	Yeah, yeah. Me neither. And, you wonder, you know, what kind of quality job would they do, you know, Just sit around for their year,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	or would they really, you know, make a contribution of some kind.
M:	Right, yeah, I, I agree.
A:	Yeah, it's tough. It's tough.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm not sure either. But, I think, there would have to be a lot more, you know, information, you know, disseminated, before you say, let's do this, you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I think it would be better for them to be, you, you get them at a, at a place where they can be taught something.
A:	Yeah.

A:	Yeah. That's right.
M:	And, uh, I think it's a shame too, because I think the schools are doing so much wrong, you know,
A:	Yeah.
M:	and then you see these really, really gross things,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but, you know, it's, it, it doesn't, you can't expect that they're going to read anything.
A:	Right.
M:	you know, and, and they can say, well, we're all here.
A:	That's right. Yeah. That's a real waste too. It really is.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps, like we, you know, we saw back, I guess, in the Carter administration,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	that was, that was a big thing with him.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, I guess even back to Kennedy, as a matter of fact, I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing, or was, you know, really interested in things like that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I just don't hear much about it anymore. Like I say, I don't even know what programs are, are even ongoing now, you know.
M:	Right.
A:	Anyway, it's a tough question.
M:	Yeah, it really is.
A:	Okay, well thanks for your time. I enjoyed talking to you.
M:	Nice talking to, and have a good evening.
A:	Okay, take care.
