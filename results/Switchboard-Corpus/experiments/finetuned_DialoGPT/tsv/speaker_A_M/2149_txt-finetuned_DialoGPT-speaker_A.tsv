M:	just, just a little bit.
A:	Yeah. I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I, I, I'd force them. I think that, uh, I think it would be, I think I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Right, exactly. I was a, I was a Boy Scout. As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do, you know, projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I think, uh.
A:	I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff.
M:	No problem at all.
A:	Well, we have a funny commercial around here. It says something like, if people were to give five, hours a week or five percent of their salary, we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something. So,  I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could, uh,
M:	Yeah, I guess, uh.
A:	or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Substitute. My, my, yeah,
M:	Well, that's, that, that would be true.
A:	my kid will do four or five hours this week for me. No problem.
M:	That's great.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh
A:	I've seen that. Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	They, they, just started trying to get them, something together like, like that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice storm uh, very, very recently.
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	You don't sound like you're in the north. You sound like you're in the south somewhere.
M:	No, I'm in the, uh east of Dallas.
A:	Yeah, uh, I'm in, uh, New York.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Upstate New York, yeah.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
M:	Yeah, I, I think that, uh.
A:	Long way, uh,
M:	Oh.
A:	And we just had a really big ice storm. And, basically, half the trees in, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh right upstate. Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore.
M:	Yeah, I think we had about four inches of snow on the ground in about, uh uh, this evening.
A:	That's how bad it was. Everything is just down everywhere.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power.
M:	Yeah.
A:	You know, it was, and, you know, and, and they, and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh, yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been ten days already and there are still something like ten thousand people without power.
M:	Yeah.
A:	and were officially, yeah, and we're officially in a state of emergency. Funny thing is the news, the national news how they covered it. Uh,
M:	Oh.
A:	Yeah. I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and, and we've been in a state of emergency for over, you know, for ten or eleven days.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know. We just got our phone back today, uh, and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer, or to have their organizations come, volunteer to help clean up the streets.
M:	Oh, my gosh.
A:	Because we have, you know, everywhere that a tree is down people need help and,  we're all, all, a lot of older folks need help getting,  their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and they, and, and they certainly can't carry it themselves
M:	Yeah.
A:	and, So,
M:	Well, that's a shame because it's really, it's, it really is a problem.
A:	Oh, that's great.
M:	It's, it's just, uh
A:	And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth or,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, so he,
M:	So, you know
A:	That's real nice.
M:	So, it's real convenient, too.
A:	Right.
M:	But, um,
A:	That,  that's real good.
M:	And, uh, we have, uh  had real good luck with that.
A:	And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling  to be doing that.
M:	Oh, it sure does.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh, I think it's helped a lot.
A:	That's, that's, uh, that's real good.
M:	Yeah, it, it really is.
A:	We had, uh, we had organizations like that in college, you know. We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that, some did elderly visits,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	some did, uh, some did, you know, Big Brother, Big Sister, stuff like that. And I'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a, some sort of group. You know, activity like that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	You know. Twenty-five, I don't know. Twenty-five percent? A asks someone else in the Yeah, my wife was big in that
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And she thinks, yeah, twenty-five percent. It, it was a small school
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But, uh, Yeah, but, I mean, a, a, a lot of people would get involved and, you know, because there were all different, organizations to do. There was Big Brother, Big Sister,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	they had a yearly auction, they had a dance marathon for charity or, to, to support that, group.
M:	Oh.
A:	Such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way.
M:	Well, that's great.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, uh, it's, it, it was, it had to be a lot of fun.
A:	Yeah, no, neither do I. I think it should be completely optional and you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, they're not worth a year. Or some people just, just can't even afford it, you know, whatever. I mean, the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well. You know?
M:	No, I, I think they do, I do think they pay a little bit too much.
A:	People get shipped off and then, you know, and then, and then their parents, I have a, uh, a, a friend whose, whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, you know, he and his wife just went off to visit her and, you know, I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala.
M:	Yeah.
A:	You know, so
M:	Yeah.
A:	so I think, you know, and, and, and the kid's certainly not making much money.
M:	No, no, no.
A:	So I can see where that, that, may be a problem.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Just take off a year.
M:	yeah, I know, I think that's a, a big problem, and I think it's a big part of it too.
A:	Yeah, I don't,
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah, yeah, well neither can I, so, I, I, I, I, I, I, did my service before and I'll do my little community service throughout, but never  never for a year again.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	So, so I guess our vote is no
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, it's been nice talking to you again.
M:	You too.
A:	Well, yeah, we're, we're slowly getting everything back together again. You know, it, it's taking time, but everything, you know,
M:	It's hard to find time for all of us.
A:	we got lucky. We had no damage to our house or anything so, The rest will just have to come with time.
M:	Yeah, well, we, we've been lucky. I guess, I guess we're just lucky to have been able to do that. We, uh, we bought a new house about two and a half years ago.
A:	Well, good luck to you, too.
M:	Okay, bye-bye.
A:	Bye-bye or
M:	Byee.
