A:	Yes.
M:	And, uh  and I'm not sure that's, that's not part of the problem. I mean it's just that I'm being cheeky and, uh I'm in the middle of it. I'm, I think it's part of it and it's also part of my character to be cheeky.
A:	I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, is it also legal, for you to do that? from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can use all the revenue they can get. With some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.
M:	Right.
A:	And I, I  I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	No. Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah. Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My accounting department will at the end of the month. I think that I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But I think they have the sales taxes in Pennsylvania based on the amount you buy.
A:	That's true. a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that. There, there is no well defined mechanism at all and, and that it is a a loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost. Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that. But it, but,
