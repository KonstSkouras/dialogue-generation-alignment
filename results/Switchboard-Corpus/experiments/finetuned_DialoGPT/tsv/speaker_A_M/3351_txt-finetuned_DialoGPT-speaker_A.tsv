M:	And, uh, she's, she was a, a very, a happy, a caring individual,
A:	Sure, sure.
M:	Okay, well I, I've got two cats and two dogs.
A:	Yeah.
M:	that's one of my favorite things to do.
A:	Wow.
M:	and they're just kind of, I don't know, kind of off the wall.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I guess it's just, uh, he, he likes to, to go in and out of the zoo, you know, and I guess he likes that.
A:	Wow. Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and it was, it was just, it's just,
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but it was a very poor animal.
A:	Right.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, and the skunk.
M:	And, uh it was, it, it scared me to death, you know.
A:	Oh, yeah. Um.
M:	He's, he's very protective, but he, he doesn't like to come into my room.
A:	Oh. Uh, I had, I had a dog one time, and, uh, he chased after a, after a skunk and got sprayed
M:	Oh
A:	so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh, get him cleaned up,
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and, uh.
A:	Right, but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to to back up and get ready.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, why, I don't know, I, I think they're kind of nice to have, they're kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to, I don't know, when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of enjoyable to, you know, have like, I don't know, something giving you some affection as well.
M:	Uh-uh. Right.
A:	What, what do you think? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
M:	and that's always a thrill.
A:	Yeah. Um, do you like big dogs or or little dogs?
M:	Well, I like little dogs. I have a seven year old and a six year old.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and we were just, he was just so excited about it, you know, and then he got so fat.
A:	Really.
M:	And we had to, we had this big dog that was just a miniature and then we had these, these big, uh, well, he was like a dog inside.
A:	Yeah.
M:	She was a, a good dog. Uh, but she was also a, uh, a very good, uh uh, outdoor dog.
A:	Uh-huh almost cruel for him to, to walk.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Wow, yeah.
M:	It was just a, a very emotional, uh, situation.
A:	Sure. Yeah.
M:	But, uh, we had, uh we had a, a, we have a, uh a dog, and we're, we're kind of in the middle of that right now,
A:	Yeah, we've got a calico cat too.
M:	Oh, that's, that is a huge cat.
A:	Yeah, yeah, she's the, she's the nice one. We, uh, we used to live in an apartment and like, our cats never went outside, but, um, the neighbors used to let their dogs out, and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy, and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were in
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	so, we had to, we had to flea bath them and it was, uh, it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that,
A:	Yeah.
M:	and, uh I, I took the kids with me, and they were away for a week, and I had to get them back, and so, I didn't, I had a hard time getting them, uh.
A:	Really.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me of that
A:	Really.
M:	But, uh, we're, we live in a town home, and, uh we have, uh
A:	Oh.
M:	I just couldn't believe that.
