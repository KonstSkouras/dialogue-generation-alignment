M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six, and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty
M:	Uh, uh-hints.
A:	so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.
M:	Yeah.
A:	You don't
M:	No.
A:	are you a summer person?
M:	I'm a spring person.
A:	Are you?
M:	Yes.
A:	Well, I have a friend who's the same way, and anything below sixty, she's just not happy but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, my husband's from Nebraska, and they have more of the four seasons.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	Oh, you're used to that, too.
M:	!!!%!!;!! Remind me of that time.
A:	You don't like the cold. Well, I usually like it about sweater weather, and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.
M:	Oh.
A:	It goes from hot, and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer, and then it's cold
M:	Uh.
A:	and I wish it were several months of that.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh, some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains and you really didn't have anywhere to go, and it's sleeping time. But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either
M:	Oh, well, that's that's not bad.
A:	Oh, yeah. Well, sure it does. That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.
M:	Yeah, it really does.
A:	And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	But I did a walk last night, and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.
M:	Oh, that's good.
A:	Well, I agree, absolutely, and you know, it's all relative, because I was from West Texas, and it was very dry, and so I thought Dallas was awful, and I still think so, but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week, and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning. They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to. But I agree with you, the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.
M:	Yeah, I, I know.
A:	Yes. I do not like the
M:	!!!%!! Remind me!! remind me! Reminders me!
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and it, it keeps the, uh, the weeds out and gives it a really good root, and it keeps everything nice and green, and the sun keeps the weeds from getting in and out and it's a pretty, pretty place.
A:	Yeah, I think so too. I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains
M:	Uh, I, I like to get out and mow my grass, too.
A:	but it seems like here, I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.
M:	Uh, I, I guess that's what I would do, too.
A:	So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,
M:	Yeah.
A:	I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	Yeah. Yeah, are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.
M:	Um, no, not really because I like the, I like to have the cool, the cool air up above my head.
A:	Yeah, yeah.
M:	I don't know, it just seems like it gets hot, doesn't it?
A:	Yeah.
M:	and I can just, I just can't deal with that.
A:	Yeah, keep it there
M:	Yeah
A:	Yeah.
M:	I like to watch the, the gymnastics sometimes.
A:	Well, I do, too, I do, too and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.
M:	!!!;!! Remind me that we had a school football game last year.
A:	Static here.
M:	 static all the time.
A:	Yeah. We do too. I think a lot of people agree the same.
M:	Well,
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and, uh, it's, it just makes it so much more convenient.
A:	Uh-huh, now there have been worse summers. In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,
M:	Oh, really?
A:	everybody seems to be, you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting, and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold, and they'll say, well those are the ones that like the cold weather.
M:	Uh, well, we, we live in a real cold climate.
A:	Oh, yeah, he did, he did. It was it was really a shame.
M:	Well, he, he's just a, he really is a good athlete, but he's, uh.
A:	He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.
M:	Well, that's true.
A:	It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes
M:	Yeah, it is, it really is.
A:	Oh, is that right? Okay.
M:	!!!%
A:	Oh, good.
M:	They just say, well, you know, you have to cut off, and then we'll be able to play
A:	Well good, well, then have a good day.
M:	Thanks.
A:	And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.
M:	Thanks.
