M:	And they're all very active. They, uh, my two older boys are still out running around. They have a, a four year old and a two year old. And I, I run a mile on the treadmill on Saturday mornings and on Sunday afternoon I start. I run about three miles, but on Saturday I start again on Sunday morning I start at about six and a boy and a girl.
A:	I haven't had my oldest one quite nine years, I've had him probably five years.
M:	Yeah, I think that's the way it is.
A:	Oh yes, I love my cats. I lost one, one time, uh,
M:	Oh.
A:	the first one I got. He jumped off the balcony actually, of a second story apartment.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And he'd never been outside, like, you know, by himself outside.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And it started raining and I was hysterical. I was, I was, I mean, you would have thought a child had died.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I called everyone I knew, I had every friend I knew in the apartment searching for this cat.
M:	Oh.
A:	And they laughed at me, they thought that was so hysterical.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Oh yeah.
M:	and I, I just can't stand it.
A:	The cat was here first so I know, it's hard.
M:	Yeah, I know.
A:	Oh, how funny.
M:	So, we sleep a lot, but it's a good thing that there isn't any.
A:	That's sweet, I have the two, the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they didn't used to be actually, but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside, so I put them outside once I got a house and they're doing great out there, they love it. But the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.
M:	Yeah, well, you know, it's like, uh, it was like, it, it'll kill me, you're right, but then when you get inside, it will jump up and do something, you don't know.
A:	Other than that he gets scared to death. If you shut that door he goes into hiding.
M:	Uh-hue.
A:	I think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony
M:	Oh.
A:	And Lord knows what happened to him. He's probably been through all kinds of nightmares.
M:	Uh-hugs.
A:	Probably.
M:	You know, it's, it, it was a, it really was a scary movie. I mean, I, I don't know how they could kill that many people in that movie.
A:	Are they.
M:	Yeah, one's a, a girl and the other's a boy, so.
A:	Oh no.
M:	And so we had to start all over. We had to get a dog, a lot of work.
A:	Oh my gosh.
M:	So,
A:	Oh, I imagine.
M:	He, he really is.
A:	I wonder how many of his lives he missed, when that happened.
M:	Well, he lives in like a woods, it's like a, a farm, and he goes to like two or three weeks a year.
A:	Oh, I can imagine, what did he shoot him with.
M:	Well, he shot himself in the foot, and he fell into the trap.
A:	Oh my gosh. People are crazy.
M:	Yeah, yeah.
A:	Oh Lord.
M:	He was just, he was just about ready to go. And I, I said, well you know I'm going to wait and see what happens. And he, he went in and looked at me like, you're crazy. And, uh  I said I don't want to shoot my dog.
A:	Oh man.
M:	and he's still kicking around.
A:	I imagine. They usually are after something like that happens to them. It seems to mellow them or something.
M:	Yeah.
A:	No.
M:	We have two cats. And, uh
A:	Oh yeah, I I keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because I feel like I don't, I can't take care of them as well because they're outside,
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back,
M:	Yeah, I know,
A:	and I feel like they need a big home, a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things. But I can't give them up.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I just, I go hysterical when they don't come home.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And you go crazy thinking it might be yours.
M:	That's right.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	He was just like, you know, I can't do this, I want to do this.
A:	Ugh!
M:	and, uh.
A:	Really.
M:	I don't know, but I think it's pretty.
A:	It's here now, we have to keep it. Yeah, my, my first one that I got, I had just moved away from home and got my own apartment. It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.
M:	Yeah.
A:	So I found this one and, uh, actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens.
M:	Oh, I know.
A:	And I thought well that's interesting, I'll call them.
M:	Yeah, that's, that, that would be good.
A:	And he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens.
M:	Uh-hauh.
A:	And he was the last one she carried across, you know, the whole big sad story.
M:	Yeah.
A:	So of course, I had to take him. I felt so sorry for him after that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And he is, uh, you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah, he, I asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young, which he was, because his mom was killed, so.
M:	Well, that's sad.
A:	But he is the lovingest cat. Everybody, people who don't even like cats, like him.
M:	He is.
A:	He never meows, he, he doesn't have any front claws, I had him declawed,
M:	Oh, really?
A:	but he doesn't bite anybody he's just, he's just kind of there, real friendly and docile.
M:	Uh-hau.
A:	Oh yeah, yeah, we do, we call that doing biscuits,
M:	Uh-hum.
A:	"it looks like their kneading bread *spelling ""their"" should be ""they're"""
M:	Oh, my.
A:	Oh, I just love cats. I like dogs, they're okay, I had, I had a dog when I lived at home
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh yeah, they do.
M:	I don't know how they do it, but they do, uh,
A:	Oh they are. I love it, it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And they just act so funny.
M:	That's neat.
A:	Really.
M:	They're really neat cats.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they'll just, they'll move in with me, and then, you know, the cat will jump up and bark and bark.
A:	A train of cats running around.
M:	Yeah, I've seen those.
A:	Oh how funny, I can imagine. Yeah, I wouldn't give anything for my cats. I love them to death.
M:	Well, we, uh, we have a two year old and a three year old, so, uh.
A:	What are your cats' names.
M:	Um, we have two cats, aaute and a Persian Gulf Persian.
A:	Oh, how sweet.
M:	And, uh we have a Schnauzer.
A:	I have Xanadu and Precious, and Rascal.
M:	!!!%!! translated
A:	Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like. Nothing. Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,
M:	Oh, that's neat.
A:	and Rascal is a black and white short hair.
M:	Huh.
A:	They don't look a thing a like,
M:	Huh-uh.
A:	and they came from the same litter and everything.
M:	Oh, gosh.
A:	Oh.
M:	And, uh
A:	So ugly she's cute, right.
M:	Yeah, yeah, I like her.
A:	Really.
M:	She's, you know, she doesn't want to be around other people. She wants to be with other people, and, you can tell by her, her heart to, to, you don't have to be a little bit snippy, but a little snippy and she doesn tinker around with things.
A:	Oh.
M:	She's like a little shadow.
A:	Is she the oldest one?
M:	She's the, the youngest one.
A:	Really.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh I know it's like the end of the world.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I know that's how I am about Xanadu.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Oh definitely.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And I think that's, I think they're a lot of work.
A:	You can walk a dog and that's okay for weekend but cats are good all the time.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	It wouldn't have, no that would be a problem
M:	That's right.
A:	Have you seen those, uh, do you ever read COSMO.
M:	I don't know, I've never heard of it.
A:	There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him. Hanging on his clothes, you know, they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said, of course I love cats. And they were just all over him and sitting on his head, the whole nine yards. It was so funny.
M:	Oh, I love them.
A:	Watch me.
M:	I know.
A:	Definitely.
M:	I mean, they're, they, they really are a lot of fun.
A:	Oh I wouldn't either. There'd be no way.
M:	Well, the, the problem is that we have two, uh, well, one is that the, uh we don't have a, a cat,
A:	Oh really, oh well.
M:	But, um, we've been trying to get, we're trying to find, uh, some places that will take, um magazines, you know, just for, just their little things.
A:	That's life, that's how life goes.
M:	Yeah.
A:	I know, I love mine too. Well, it's been nice talking to you.
M:	It's been good talking to, to you, too.
A:	Me to. Bye, bye.
M:	Bye.
