M:	Uh, I donno, I didn't know it was that high. I, I hadn't heard.
A:	Um, you know, different things, is it restricted to certain crimes? Or just,
M:	Uh, well, you see, I, I'm not sure. I, uh, I know that in, in, uh in my state, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Um. Well.
M:	You know, they've already ruled on that.
A:	Yes, I know, the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent and, they want, I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed
M:	Uh.
A:	I just, I can't see that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Um, I don't know, I think there's a lot of things that can be done about it. Um.
A:	No.
M:	I don't have that problem either.
A:	Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it
M:	Yeah.
A:	it's really sad.
M:	It is.
A:	I don't know, I just think, um, somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	with, someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know. Is really kind of bad
M:	Yeah, that's true.
A:	and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,
M:	Right.
A:	Oh, I don't know, is it, do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?
M:	I don't, no. I don tinker with it that much.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I, I think it's important that we, uh, be aware of all the problems that we're having and I think that we need to take steps to correct it.
A:	Um.
M:	I'm not religious but, I do believe that God works in all things through all kinds of grace and, uh, you know, I think that, uh God's going to take care of us all in this.
A:	I don't know, sometimes I feel, I mean I do go to church and things. I don't know how I would feel about it. But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.
M:	Uh-uh. Uh-hue.
A:	Do you think most states have that or?
M:	Most definitely.
A:	That still does it, that's right.
M:	I think so.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that it's still, it's, it still is a law in many, many states still. Um,
A:	Have that. Well, and it doesn't seem like very many people, uh, are really, I mean, there's a lot of people that are on death row. But there's not very many people that actually, um. do get killed.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. So, it seems like a of people live there, and then through appeals.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Because I know they do frequently, I mean they cover, cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper.
M:	Well, I'm not sure I've ever been to a jury that didn't have some sort of background check.
A:	If it finally gets to that point.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But, um, I think the appeal process takes too long. I don't know, I, I'm not sure if they're ready to go back and do it.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So is it, uh, are we doing lethal injection now?
M:	Yeah, it's, it, it just, uh it's going to take, uh.
A:	Uh-huh, which seems so awful.
M:	Yeah, so, uh.
A:	So, it's a little bit more humane, I guess, it is,
M:	Uh, I, I do feel that, uh uh, you know, people that are in prison, I think, uh should be able to serve. Uh, I've heard some talk about it, you, you wouldn't be able, uh  to sentence someone to life without possibility of parole
A:	Yes, the other one just seems so terrible.
M:	Yeah, yeah, I, I would like to see, uh, like in the United States where, uh you know, like if, if, uh someone, uh uh, uh gets seriously ill, they, they go to a, a hospital and they're treated like any other, uh...
A:	Um.
M:	I don't know, I just, I, I'm, I don't see anything wrong with it.
A:	Well, do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or, it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison?
M:	Well no, because I think we want to, uh, have the best prison systems in the world.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think it just drives, uh, the jails down, the economy down, and I don, I, you, you can't blame the people that have them because they want to, you don't have to go out and get them, you just have to, have them do something else.
A:	Um.
M:	And I think it will, it will help the, uh, the economy.
A:	Yes.
M:	But, uh,
A:	Um. Well, um, and I notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area It's, It's kind of been scary, to think about it
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and, And you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that.
M:	Yes. Well the thing is, I think that's a, a big part of it is that we don't really know how serious the problem is.
A:	You hate to have the dubious honor of being, you know, so high in the, in statistics,
M:	Right.
A:	But I, you know, we have been really fortunate our family, hasn't had any crime.
M:	Well, that's true.
A:	And, so we don't, it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And how they would expect, how they would hope,
M:	Yeah.
A:	I mean you, you hear of people who have, um, committed crimes, and then they get out of jail and they go, and they do the same thing again.
M:	Uh, I, I don't know. I, you know, I have, I think, uh, you see it more as a, a social disease.
A:	And you wonder why they can't just stop it.
M:	Uh, well, they can.
A:	So, maybe you would,
M:	Yeah.
A:	but still I would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone.
M:	Yeah, I, I think that, uh, the way the law reads, uh you know, in most states it reads, if you sentence someone to life in prison, they get twenty years and, uh they have a possibility of parole.
A:	No, I know when, um, we just, we moved here, uh, I from the, I got a summons, jury summons,
M:	Oh.
A:	just like constantly, it seemed like,
M:	Well, that's, that is, that, that was a, a pretty wild experience.
A:	but fortunately I had small children and I didn't have to go.
M:	Uh, I've been in that situation where I, uh.
A:	And it's not that, I mean, I think everyone should have to serve on the jury,
M:	Right, right.
A:	it's just that, I didn't, I hate having to be in charge of someone else's life.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And I would hate to have to hear any kind of case, involving a violent crime or anything.
M:	Uh, I would. Uh, I know, uh, uh uh, my wife and I were, uh, uh, in a, a situation where we were recently married and we had a, uh a child and, uh it was a, it was, it, it involved a, you know, a murder.
A:	That would be really awful.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, anyway, I sure have enjoyed, uh, talking to you about this. Although it has been difficult but, uh.
M:	Yeah, it has, it's been real interesting.
A:	I'd hate to decide it, but I guess, uh, guess it's important, that we decide as a people what, what we're going to do.
M:	Right.
A:	Anyway, well, you have a good day.
M:	You too.
A:	Thank you, bye-bye.
M:	Bye-bye
