M:	Yeah, and I have a, I have, I live on one of the outskirts of Dallas.
A:	Okay. Yeah.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me. This is going to sound familiar, but, uh.
A:	No, that's okay
M:	No.
A:	Okay.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh, that's neat.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Wow, that's large
M:	It really is.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But the area that I am in, it is quite large. Uh-homing.
A:	Oh, well, that's not too bad,
M:	Yeah.
A:	that's still fairly new.
M:	Yeah, but it's, it was, you had to, you knew, you needed to get it serviced, you didn't have to, put it on rusted out,
A:	Well,
M:	and it's not even the square footage that's, uh.
A:	Oh, you're kidding Well, do you mind if I ask what it's worth down there, I mean, what it's,
M:	Yeah, it's really funny, I, I've, uh I've been down there and seen, uh
A:	Okay.
M:	But, uh.
A:	It, it sounds like, I mean, from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I mean, Dallas is a very marked up area, although right now it's a lot lower um, because of all the layoffs and everything
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	the economy around here is real poor
M:	Uh.
A:	Well, no, not really
M:	I don't think so.
A:	Um, the area itself, uh, the Fort Worth Dallas area, um, has become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies, including Texas Instruments
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	Um, there's been tremendous amounts of, of, uh, layoffs so, really housing is real bad. The economy itself around here is not too terribly bad, but housing is still real bad
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Yeah. This is,
M:	it's, it's a, it, it really is.
A:	Oh.
M:	but, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Oh.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Wow.
M:	and, uh, it, it was a tremendous amount of work.
A:	So, do you think, it was overdeveloped then?
M:	Uh, I think it was, but I think the, the people who were opposed to it said that it was a failed test and that we needed to do something about it.
A:	Wow.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Um.
M:	It's, uh, it, it seems to me that the, that the immigration of America has, uh, uh, uh been a problem for a long time, and that, uh...
A:	Um yeah. Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Well, right now we're just renting, but it is a home. Um,
M:	A home, a home that's not a, you know, a condominium or anything.
A:	it's a four bedroom home It has about, I guess, eighteen hundred square feet It's on one floor
M:	Uh.
A:	Uh, we have no basement I don't know,
M:	Well, that's nice.
A:	Okay I wasn't sure. Most of the ones, you know, up north and everything do, but, um, anyway, it's, uh, it's pretty, also pretty typical for the area. Most of this area was developed, this house was built in seventy-four.
M:	!!!% Oh, really?
A:	So most of the, it's almost twenty years old, and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style Uh, we have a friend that lives two blocks over, and his house is almost identical to us, except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
M:	Uh, uh-homing.
A:	but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same. So I, I think most of them are there was, it, like most areas that are built, um, there were probably, like two or three styles you could choose from
M:	Uh.
A:	And, and, uh, that's pretty much all the houses in the area, for probably a square mile, I'd say, at least, maybe even a little bit more than that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Where are you in relation to Sevren? are you close to Sevren?
M:	Uh, I am in Dallas.

A:	Well, I just,
M:	I don't know, I've only been up here a couple of weeks, so I don't have much time to go to the beach.
A:	I have a sister that used to live in Sevren.
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	And they bought their home in I, I want to say like around nineteen seventy-five or something like that, and they paid like, they, they had it built from, you know, they, they designed it and everything, and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it, and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand
M:	Oh, my word.
A:	Yeah, so I just wondered, you know, if the whole area was like that or,
M:	!!!%!!That's the whole thing.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But, uh, I don't know. I, uh.
A:	Um.
M:	So, I, I really wanted to get one. I, you, you would think, you'd think that, you wouldn't have to worry about getting a condominium, but, you're right, it's just, it would be nice.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But it was, it had a very modern feel to it.
A:	Sounds like a lot of money though
M:	Oh, yeah.
A:	sure. Yeah.
M:	But, uh, I don't know.
A:	Right. Oh, yeah.
M:	And, uh, you don't have to pay any income tax.
A:	Wow. Yeah.
M:	but, you're right, it, it does seem that, that, you see more and more of the, uh, the less fortunate people are becoming more selfish and less responsible.
A:	Wow Wow, that's,
M:	!!! Remind me of that house.
A:	Really? That much of a difference?
M:	Uh, I think, I, I'm not sure, I really don't know.
A:	Wow.
M:	yeah, it, it really does, it makes you think.
A:	Yeah
M:	but, um, it, it just, it was a, it had to be put up. I mean, it did not, you know, it really didn't, it didn't do anybody any good, I, I think, it wasn't,
A:	Wow. Why is that? Do you know? I mean
M:	Well, you're, you know, you pay a hundred and fifty five dollars for state tax in Texas.
A:	Uh-huh
M:	But they have no incentive to, uh, uh  you know, to, to do anything.
A:	Oh.
M:	and, uh, so, you know, it's, it costs you almost twice as much as living costs.
A:	Oh
M:	but,
A:	My goodness
M:	And, uh.
A:	Wow
M:	and, uh.
