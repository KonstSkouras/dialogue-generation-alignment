M:	Uh, do you have a garden or,
A:	and they put them out on a certain day of the week
M:	Uh.
A:	and each, uh, home does participate but we really don't have anything, uh, close in this area that, that do anything. And, and some of the communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it. Which really doesn't make sense.
M:	Right, right.
A:	Yeah, that's good.
M:	And, uh
A:	Yeah, yeah. That's another thing. You have to go to different places to do that.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh-huh. But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that. Which, uh, I don't know, it just doesn't make sense to me.
M:	Well, I think it's just a, it's a matter of, of people not being lazy and not paying, you, you don't want to, you want to say, well, I just didn't take the time to look and see what it was.
A:	Yeah. Yeah.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Yeah. That's good, that's good.
M:	So, yeah, I guess I, I,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	but they've, they've really, uh, started to cut down on that.
A:	Huh. No.
M:	And, and it's not like they, you know, they, it's, it doesn't, they don't really have a, a, uh, a marketing deal on it.
A:	Oh, I didn't know that.
M:	You know, you have to have a certain weight,
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Well, that's good. I, I'm, you know, unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't, they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection
M:	Uh,
A:	and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	She lives in Garland and I'm not sure where, what she does. But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
M:	Uh-oh.
A:	Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing. And she does make a lot of sense.
M:	Oh, that's great.
A:	Just her whole house is like wow.
M:	Huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	and they say, well, you know, I, I can't say I'm sure, but she says, uh, she said she's not going to tell me.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And you can't stop it, so.
A:	Yeah. And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat. I sat and watched him. You know the Barney? You know the little, I don't know if you know the little character Barney.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing and how children can, can do that and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on.
M:	Oh, boy.
A:	And keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing. He's really caught on so that's really neat
M:	Oh, that is neat.
