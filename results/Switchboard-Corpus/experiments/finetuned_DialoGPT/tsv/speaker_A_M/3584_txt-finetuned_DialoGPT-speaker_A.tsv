M:	And, uh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	But it's got a good story line and I really enjoyed it.
A:	Huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	It sounds nice.
M:	Yeah, it is. It's, it has a lot of room for activities.
A:	Oh, yeah?
M:	and so, uh.
A:	Yeah. Well, you know, these guys that gambled high lost big you know.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh I'm insulating myself from that problem.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I'm building my own house.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And as I look out the window of my trailer, I can envision all the insulation that's going up today
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah.
M:	Well, it's been nice talking to you.
A:	Yeah.
M:	I was just going to ask you, do you do it yourself or do you have someone do it for you?
A:	I used to be a builder.
M:	Oh, really?
A:	And I retired about five years ago and  started college.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And now I'm a college educated builder There's still no work, you know.
M:	Huh.
A:	So, uh, you know, I decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so I did.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home.
M:	Oh, really.
A:	You can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own.
M:	Oh, that's right.
A:	Well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah I want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's  holding the bag.
M:	That's right.
A:	Well.
M:	It's, it, it is a terrible thing.
A:	As, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much. Right?
M:	Right.
A:	Hence the savings and loan problem we have.
M:	Right. Right.
A:	But, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple. It's designed to be added on to.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Yeah. Well, I figure it's just me and my wife but, you know, I like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot, so I want  to have a shop.
M:	That's right.
A:	Ten acres.
M:	Oh, ten acres. That sounds great.
A:	Well, yeah. It's really nice too because I can't see my nearest neighbor. He's on the other side of a hill.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon. Seriously.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, in the winter time, I can see, see another guy but, you know, he's
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I can just make out his place, you know. I've got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten miles to the north.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And, uh,
M:	Well, I'm sure you're, you're a T I employee.
A:	Yeah. Well, I took a lot of time in choosing this site because the, the house has no heating or air conditioning.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Well, it's got a, a very small furnace.
M:	Oh.
A:	And a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well.
M:	Okay.
A:	But, in the house itself, I've been working inside, you know, these, these many months
M:	Uh, yeah.
A:	and I have not had to use the heat.
M:	Uh.
A:	Because it's all geothermal.
M:	Yeah.
A:	And with all the, see I've got, on the south side is all glass. Well, as much as I could get in it, you know. And, uh, the east side is glass.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I've got one, two, three, four, five, six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet. So it's almost all glass.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	And, uh,
M:	Well, that's interesting.
A:	Oh, yeah. I mean, you know.  There's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows.
M:	Yeah. Yeah.
A:	So, uh,
M:	So you know, it's, it, it is hard to find time, time to spend together.
A:	Well, not really. It's, uh, it's on the side of a hill.
M:	Oh, okay.
A:	So the first, you know, the, the, the, what I call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep.
M:	!!!%!!',!!;!!'!!body!! Remind me of that now.
A:	And the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me.
A:	So I've got a pretty good grade there.
M:	Yeah, I, I've, I'm trying to think of the other grade they put in there. I, uh
A:	And then when I put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides that will define the shop.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Exactly.
M:	It's not a,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh,
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, and, uh, you just step in and, and it's like, oh, my God, I can't even do that
