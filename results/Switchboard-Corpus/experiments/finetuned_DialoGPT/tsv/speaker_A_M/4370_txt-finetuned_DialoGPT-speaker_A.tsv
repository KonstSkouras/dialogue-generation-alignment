M:	You can appeal and,
A:	Um. Yeah, it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things. I think I have a severe demeanor or something.
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	Uh,
M:	Well, I, I guess that's the only thing I can really think of is, uh
A:	But, typically, you know, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice.
M:	Right.
A:	Right.
M:	And I think that, uh  you know, you can, you can have a jury that, that doesn't have to be all the same
A:	So,
M:	I mean, you, you're not going to go out and, and get all, all the best, all of the best players, you can get.
A:	So if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have nincompoops to, uh,
M:	Right. That's true.
A:	Um.
M:	!!!%!! Remind me of that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Um.
M:	I think they should have the option of either guilty or innocent, but, I don, I agree with you that jury selection should be based on how you feel about the case.
A:	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
M:	and, and they have no right to ask for a jury of their peers.
A:	Um.
M:	And I think the judges should be able to recommend sentencing.
A:	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
M:	So, I don't know. I think, I think sometimes it's a little bit of the media's resistance to it.
A:	Well, I suppose you may be right on that. Matter of fact, I've heard that,  I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Oh, is it? Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay.
M:	So, yeah, it's, it, it kind of is a, a double whammy. The judge, uh-hired the case and then the jury then, uh decides who gets the death penalty.
A:	Right.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I, I don't know, I,
A:	Uh-huh. So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them.
M:	Right. I, I, uh.
A:	Um.
M:	The only way that you can rehabilitate a person is by, uh, persuade them of a behavior that is detrimental to their welfare or, uh.
A:	What about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets.
M:	Yeah, I think that, uh.
A:	Oh, really?
M:	Yeah.
A:	Like what?
M:	Well, you know, I mean, I'm, I work at a, a high school.
