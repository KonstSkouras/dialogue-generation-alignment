M:	But, uh
A:	Uh-huh. I agree with that.
M:	So, uh.
A:	I guess, I'm, I'm a student right now and I don't make a whole lot of money and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored. I go to a state sponsored school and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff, so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long. My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything, but, uh, I usually end up getting money back. I will this year anyway from a,
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, I am I need it, too, otherwise,
M:	Well, I've been working for, uh, the government for the last eight years.

A:	Wow.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. Well isn't,
M:	You know, we, we don't have a state income tax. Uh, we have a sales tax on everything, you know, clothing and, and buying and things like that, and that's pretty high.
A:	Uh-huh, there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.
M:	Yeah, and, uh.
A:	Uh-huh. The taxes that people don't think about that, yeah, the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.
M:	Right.
A:	Uh-huh. There was that, which was it Jerry Brown, one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a I think a flat percentage, something like that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So, uh.
A:	Right. Exactly. That's, because until, like eight,
