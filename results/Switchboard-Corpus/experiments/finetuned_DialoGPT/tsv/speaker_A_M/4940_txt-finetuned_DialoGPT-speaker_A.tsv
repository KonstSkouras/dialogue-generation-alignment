M:	Oh, really?
A:	And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas so, there's ...
M:	Well, that's true. I have a friend who lives in Dallas and she says that there's, there, there are a lot of smog problems,
A:	No, not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is.
M:	Well, they do have, uh the, the, they have a couple of areas where you can go to and, and you can, uh uh, uh, mulch and things like that.
A:	Yeah. We're going there tomorrow.
M:	Okay.
A:	Uh-huh We're  packing and getting ready to go to .
M:	Oh. Well, we're,  going to have to go again.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh, I grew up in New York,
A:	Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, you do then.
M:	But, uh, I've lived here all my life.
A:	Is it really?
M:	Yeah, it is.
A:	I would not imagine that.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Huh.
M:	You know, that's, that is one of the worst I have ever seen.
A:	Huh. You learn  something every day.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh-huh. Yeah, I've seen that.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Huh.
M:	And, uh  it's really, really bad.
A:	Huh-uh.
M:	I don't know.
A:	Huh. No
M:	Huh, I don't know.
A:	Oh, yeah Yeah.
M:	and, uh, we have a lot, a lot more cow manure in our area than we do in the north
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	They have, uh, a lot more vegetable to them.
A:	Yeah, that's true.
M:	But, uh.
A:	Right. Huh. And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore. You buy unleaded. Right?

A:	Yeah. Huh.

A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and I don't know if they're going to do that in the next couple of years.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So it's not, it's a fully manned, uh-hired military machine. It has, uh it has the, uh the electronic ignition and all the other stuff. But it's got, uh a full size air bag and a full seat and, uh  the whole thing is locked into the back.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	Then the battery dies and you have to start all over again.
A:	Huh That is good.
M:	and the engine will still be running.
A:	Yeah.
M:	So, it's, it, it can be a real problem.
A:	Yeah.

M:	Yeah.
A:	Huh.
M:	And, uh, they, they've, they have, uh they've actually, uh uh, done this in the past.
A:	But what, I think that was a, a, a setback. That they, I don't know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. I think like
M:	Uh-huh.
A:	I don't know. Huh. * See note above
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too. .
M:	Yeah.
A:	Well, yeah. Yeah.
M:	!!!% Yeah. But I don't think they're that expensive.
A:	Well, it doesn't make sense. Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Yeah. Yeah. Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. Like today I think it was pretty bad. I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but some days it's very nice here downtown
M:	Uh, yeah, it, it was nice, it had been, uh
A:	and other days it's just really bad, so, I don't know. So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? Or can you remember? Were you there at a?
M:	Uh, we were in the same situation, I was there at, uh at the Air Force base.
A:	Cause I haven't been there probably ...
M:	Well, I've been there like, oh, about two years.
