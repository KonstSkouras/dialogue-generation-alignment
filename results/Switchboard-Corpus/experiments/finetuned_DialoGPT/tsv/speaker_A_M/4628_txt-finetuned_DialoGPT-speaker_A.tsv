M:	But, um, I think, I, I do know that they have, they have a few different dress codes, and, um
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But we're trying to keep it up, uh, and, uh
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I'm not, I'm pretty much limited to just the large study areas.
A:	Huh. Well, I, I work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place. I work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory.
M:	Oh, uh-hoh.
A:	Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech.
M:	Okay.
A:	Uh, and, uh, so we're, we're part, we're actually part of M I T. So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh  the technical institution.
M:	Yeah.
A:	Uh, while I was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. I guess, uh, list I had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh the working conditions, things like that.
M:	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think, I don't know, I, I know that there are a lot of people who, uh
A:	I don't know. What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important?
M:	Well, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that, uh  I think, uh you know, we've, we're, we have to be careful about what we do with them.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And, uh  you know, people, they don't want to be called out for something they're not supposed to be doing.
A:	Yeah.
M:	And, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	So they just sort of, you can't say, okay, we're not going to do this, we won't do this. We're just going to let you go. And then they would come in and say, you're not, you don't have to do that.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	But they could, you could make it a practice.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, that's, that would be a good way to do it.
A:	Now how do you mean that? I know it,
M:	It's, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I mean, I've seen it in other places and it's, uh, I guess it's almost impossible to say it's any worse than any other company, uh.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	And that's, that's a negative of mine. I, I, the only, the one, the, uh, one positive that I see is that they don't have enough time to devote to the needs of the people.
A:	Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company or,
M:	Uh, I think it would be better to have, have, uh, the, uh the unanimous vote.
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	I think that, uh, that the, uh...
A:	Uh-huh.
M:	and they could see that there's a lot of people that don't want to work.
A:	Yeah. Uh-huh.
M:	And I think that's, I think they're both very true.
A:	Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. I think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather  than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off.
M:	Right.
A:	And I think you can do that for a little while but I'm,
M:	Yeah, that, that would be a good idea.
A:	Yeah.
