0,Uh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling",Hello Chuck.,Hello Ann.
1,"so, I, I thought well, I'll try that.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling",Hello Chuck.
2,"Uh, yeah.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.,"Uh, the other day, I attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling"
3,"Well, it was.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places",Uh-huh.
4,Yeah.,"Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.,"and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the E P A and lots of different places"
5,"Well E P a has been doing a lot of, uh you know, a lot more research, and, uh and they have, they have really, really, uh...","Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste.",Uh-huh.
6,Yeah.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.","Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation.","and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste."
7,"And, uh, the E S P A was the one that said that they should have been more involved with the war.",Uh-huh.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.","Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new.","Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation."
8,Uh.,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print",Uh-huh.,"Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A.","Right. So, what what is the E P A recommending now?","Well, it's not too new."
9,"and, uh they were saying that, uh the waste is not being recycled. It's being burned.",Yeah.,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print.

10,"Yeah, I, I don't know if you have a local paper, but I, uh","and they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away.",Yeah.,"But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print.

11,"Yeah, I've, I'm not a real big fan of the newspaper either.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and I try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while I just quit taking the newspaper because I couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, I suppose.","and they could sell it for a while.

12,Uh-huh.,"Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though.

13,"And they're trying to start putting the recycling in the, in the bins out front and, and the like.",Uh-huh.,"Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though.

14,"Uh, how do you handle that?","There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation",Uh-huh.,"Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here.","Right. That's a, that's a common problem though.

16,"Right, right.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside.,Right.,"There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation",Uh-huh.,"Yeah.

17,"So,","Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation",Uh-huh.
18,Uh-huh.,"So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.","Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

19,Uh-huh.,"Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one I think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet","So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it.","Well, that's good.",and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them.

21,"Uh, they have those in the, uh  in the parks.","and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that.",Uh-huh.,"Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle.

22,"Uh,","And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, I can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill","and, uh, I think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled.

23,"so, he went in and, and he got the engineering major and he proved that, that he could do it by just using the engineering degree.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

24,"!!!%!!;!! LINE!!LINE!!You bet!!That's the kind of thing that's, that I think that's really been a major problem in the last few years is that, uh...","and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

25,!!!%!! Remind me of that,Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that."
26,Uh.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.,"And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government.

27,"but, uh",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them.",Uh-huh.
28,"Right, yeah.","and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.,"and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them."
29,"So, I, I think that's the major, uh, change is that, uh.",Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space",Oh really.
30,"!!!%!! translated It's,",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.,"He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space"
31,"Uh, yeah. Well, I don't know how they would, how they'd do it with gasoline. I guess they'd have to burn it","Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity.",Right.
32,"Yeah, I think it's, it was more than just paper. He was even, he was even recycling the, the tin cans.",Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.,"and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity."
33,"And, and he didn tinker with it. He, he tinker, but, but he didn, you know, it, it was, it got, it wasn't, it didn't get anywhere near what he was trying to do.",Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it.,Huh.
34,Okay.,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.,"Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but what  what about emissions?",So his solution was to burn plastic.

35,"Well, what do you think of, uh, the space shuttle landing?",Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that.

36,Uh-huh.,He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.,Yeah. And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. Well that was he didn't deal with that.
37,"Yeah, I bet it was.","No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.,Oh.
38,"So, uh, what else can we talk about.","Yeah, well, real interesting.","No. Well it's interesting. I bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then.",He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical,Okay,He just said burn it.
39,"No, not really, because I've had it for, you know, I've been in this for, I guess about three years now.",Did it change anything for you?,"Yeah, well, real interesting.","No. Well it's interesting.
