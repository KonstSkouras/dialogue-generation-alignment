22,"So they just sort of, you can't say, okay, we're not going to do this, we won't do this. We're just going to let you go.

25,Right.,"And, uh, you know, I think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than you know, something like, unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth.
