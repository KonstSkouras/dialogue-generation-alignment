70,"Yeah. Well, you've, uh you've had some good years.","Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, uh, all that impressive, I guess. I guess I've always been a Cowboy fan.

74,"Well, I don, I've never bought any merchandise from the Cowboys, but I always like to shop anyway.","Yeah, I mean it, it was really exciting, growing up when, when the Cowboys were really big.

So, I can't, you know, I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years. I mean, I think they'll pull out of it, and, you know, they'll, they'll wind up being good again.

78,"Oh, I see.","Thirty, or thirty-two for really good tickets. See, they, they sectioned it out even more. They used to just have like, uh, first of all it was all one price.
