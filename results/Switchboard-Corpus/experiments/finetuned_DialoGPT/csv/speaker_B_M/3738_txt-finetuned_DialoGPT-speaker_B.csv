13,B,"So if you look at Russia and what's happened over there, I think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing.

27,B,"I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes. It just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes, which I think is going to be a hard thing for, for people to face.","B|I think one of the problems with, with education as it relates to this, though, is that I don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes.

28,M,"Yeah, I think, I don, I agree with you, I, I've, I have a hard time getting into a, a good teaching field, because I think a lot, a lot the people that I know that are in the education field are in that field and, uh, I know a lot who would, who wouldn't, who would benefit most from a good education.","M|Yeah, I think, I don, I agree with you, I, I've, I have a hard time getting into a, a good teaching field, because I think a lot, a lot the people that I know that are in the education field are in that field and, uh, I know a lot who would, who wouldn't, who would benefit most from a good education."

31,B,"There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about. I mean if you look at the, the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations, I don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them, even ideas of how to make those changes now.","B|There probably needs to be some training on how to, to, to adjust to these changes as they come about.
