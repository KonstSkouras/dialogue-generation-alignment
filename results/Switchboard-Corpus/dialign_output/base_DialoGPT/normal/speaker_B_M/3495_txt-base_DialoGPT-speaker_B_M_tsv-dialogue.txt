B|0| M: There _is_ no problem . 
A|1| B: It , _it_ _, it's_ _pretty_ _bad_ here , too . 
B|2| M: _I'm_ _not_ _sure_ if _you_ can call [it] _a_ problem 
A|3| B: We've had _a lot_ _of_ murders drug related and stuff . In _Durham_ , which [is] right next _to_ Raleigh . 
B|4| M: _I_ think _that_ [it's] _not_ _that_ uncommon [to] _have_ [a] murder _in a_ bar _in Durham_ . 
A|5| B: Yeah , [that] , [that] [Durham] , Raleigh , and Chapel Hill _is the_ triangle . 
B|6| M: _So_ , [the] Triangle [is the] North Carolina _of the_ South ? 
A|7| B: Right . 
B|8| M: _Well ,_ _we_ _have_ [a lot] [to] do . 
A|9| B: Yeah _, it's_ _, it's_ really _, it's_ , and I've seen [in] more [in Durham] than [I] [have] [in] Raleigh or , or or Chapel Hill . 
B|10| M: _It's [,_ it's] . 
A|11| B: Chapel Hill [is] kind [of] [a] , [a] ritzy city or whatever . [I] mean [, it's] kind [of] _, I'm_ _, I'm_ [sure] there [is] problems with [it] , but [it] has [a] _pretty_ low crime rate . Compare , compared [to] , [to] , [Durham] has probably got [the] worst . They've had _like_ forty-eight murders since [the] beginning [of the] _year ._ 
B|12| M: [I] 
A|13| B: And over half [of] [it] has been drug related . 
B|14| M: [I'm] 
A|15| B: Yeah . 
B|16| M: _It's_ . [like] . [the] . every . [year .] [year .] 
A|17| B: Yeah . 
B|18| M:  
A|19| B: [Well ,] [that] , and [the] , and [the] economy [is] _so bad_ and , And _so_ many _people_ [have] been laid off and stuff . 
B|20| M: Umm _, yeah_ . 
A|21| B: They've done special stories on _the news_ , local _news_ here . 
B|22| M: Why [is [the] news] [so bad] ? 
A|23| B: We had [a lot] [of] bank robberies and different , [lot] [of] break ins and stuff . [I] know , [like] [a] week or [so] ago , [I] live [in a] , [in a] town house , which [is] , [you] know [, it's] [a] _pretty_ nice neighborhood and this lady was going [to] work , she came home and everything [in] her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything . And nobody thought any different , they just thought she was moving . It was [a] moving man pulled right up [to] her house , broke [in] and stole everything she owned 
B|24| M: yes . 
A|25| B: [Well [,] yeah] [, it's] [, it's] [, it's] _pretty_ [bad] 
B|26| M: _It's_ 
A|27| B: Uh , [I] would say [so] for [the] majority [in] , [in] our , [in] my little section [of the] neighborhood because there [is] always somebody at home 
B|28| M: [I] 
A|29| B: and [we] all know one another and , and , on our one little section [of the] street [we] all know one another and know [that] we're [not] moving and different things [like] [that] . 
B|30| M: [I] think [I'm] gonna be fine 
A|31| B: [It's ,] _I , I'm_ _, I'm_ probably [the] , one [of the] youngest _people_ [that] live over here . 
B|32| M: [I , I'm] [so] sorry . 
A|33| B: Most _people_ are , are , retired or , or , or , [you] know , they're , they're _in their_ forties or , or whatever . [So] and [I'm] [in] my twenties _, so_ [I , I'm] [, I'm] out more than they are , but they're at home at night , 
B|34| M:  ... 
A|35| B: [so] [I] really don't worry about anything . 
B|36| M: [Well [,] I'm] [not] [a] huge fan [of] [people] [in their] late 20's [, so] [I'm] still [pretty] cool . 
A|37| B: Yeah . 
B|38| M: Are [you] guys ever [in] trouble ? 
A|39| B: Yeah , see , that's [the] same thing here . 
B|40| M: 100 . 
A|41| B: Yeah . 
B|42| M: [So] 
A|43| B: Yeah . 
B|44| M: No . That's [the] problem .
