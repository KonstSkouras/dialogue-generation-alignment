A|0| B: _Right ._ 
B|1| M: [Right .] 
A|2| B: Uh-huh . 
B|3| M: _But_ _of_ course , I'm _not_ . 
A|4| B: Uh-huh . _You_ must be _a_ . 
B|5| M: _you_ . 
A|6| B: _So_ am _I_ . 
B|7| M: He nods _. So_ _what_ _do you_ _want_ ? 
A|8| B: _Yes ,_ [what] _a_ coincidence . 
B|9| M: You're everywhere . 
A|10| B: _Yeah _,_ I_ _know_ [what] _family_ _home_ evening's all about . 
B|11| M: Not _anymore_ 
A|12| B: Uh-huh _. _Right_ _,_ and_ then _the_ _family_ _home_ evening , too . 
B|13| M: _Well , that's_ _not_ [what] [I] meant . 
A|14| B: [Right .] [Well , _that's] good ._ Um , _how many_ children [do _you] have_ ? 
B|15| M: [Right _,] _so_ _,_ it's_ _important_ _to_ me . 
A|16| B: Two ? 
B|17| M: [Yes _,] they_ [do] . 
A|18| B: [I] _have_ two _daughters_ . 
B|19| M: How [many] [daughters] [do you] own ? 
A|20| B: My oldest _is_ _, uh ,_ four _and_ my youngest _is_ about [to] turn three . Two girls . _And_ [they] _are_ _a handful_ 
B|21| M: _Uh_ _oh_ . 
A|22| B: [Yes] . We've , my _, uh _,_ well_ , when we first got married , my wife worked for _a_ year . Then we decided [to] _have kids ._ 
B|23| M: [Well ,] they're [a handful] . 
A|24| B: _And _,_ uh _,_ she_ _, she_ got pregnant _and_ then we decided _she_ would stay _home_ with _the_ _kids ._ _We_ would make that sacrifice . It _is_ [a] financial sacrifice [to] make because we go from two incomes down [to] _one_ . 
B|25| M: [I] love _it_ ! 
A|26| B: _And _,_ uh ,_ we made that decision _and_ _, uh [,_ so] after _she_ had _the_ first baby _, she_ stayed _home ._ _And _,_ and_ we had [a] second baby _and_ she's still _at home_ 
B|27| M:  
A|28| B: _And_ [so _,] uh _,_ you know ,_ _at_ _work_ [a] lot _of people_ _are_ _, you know _,_ I_ think _well_ _this_ _is_ _not a_ normal situation [anymore] _in_ our , _in_ our _world_ we live _in_ . Most [of] them _, uh ,_ continue [to] _work_ _if_ [they] _have_ , _have kids ._ 
B|29| M: [I] , 
A|30| B: [I] only _have_ _one_ other _person_ [I] _know_ _in_ my , _in_ my group here that _works_ where _the_ wife stays _home_ _, and_ [that's] because [of] religious values as _well_ . They're Baptists _and_ [they] _, and_ [they] think [that's] [important] . 
B|31| M:  ... 
A|32| B: [But] everybody else _works_ _and_ [they] drop their _kids_ off _at_ day-care _and_ _, and_ leave them _and_ _, I don't _know_ _,_ I_ just _don't_ [want] _, I_ just _don't_ [want] strangers raising my children . 
B|33| M:  ... 
A|34| B: [Right .] 
B|35| M: [So] [is] [the] 
A|36| B: _That's_ _how_ [it] [is] _at_ our house when _you're_ on [the] phone . Oh [, it's] open , anything goes when mom's on [the] phone 
B|37| M: Is [this] 
A|38| B: Uh-huh . 
B|39| M: Ohhaha _. So_ [you] ... 
A|40| B: [Right .] 
B|41| M: I'm [the] kid's [home .] 
A|42| B: [Right .] 
B|43| M: _right ._ 
A|44| B: [Right .] 
B|45| M: [I] read [the] books _in the_ morning . 
A|46| B: With all [the] yard _work_ _and_ things _like_ that . 
B|47| M: [I] wonder [how many] hours [a] _day_ he spends _in the_ office . 
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M:  ... [I] ... I'm [not] sure 
A|50| B: Uh-huh _. [Right_ ,] we feel that _, you know ,_ just spending _time_ together . _You_ _don't_ necessarily _have_ [to] be doing anything _, you know ,_ that costs money or , or _, you know ,_ that requires [you] [to] go [a] great distance or anything _like_ that . _It's_ just [the] _kids_ _like_ _to ,_ being together as _a family ._ 
B|51| M:  ... 
A|52| B: Like last Saturday we went , had some errands [to] run _and_ [so] we took [the] _kids_ _and_ _, and_ went by [the] Farmers Market down [in] , [in] , down there [in] Garland . 
B|53| M: [We] 
A|54| B: _And_ [they] had [a] blast running around [the] Farmers Market looking _at_ all _the _,_ you know _,_ the_ food _and_ tasting all [the] free samples [they] were giving out . _And_ [they] had [a] little pen there with animals [in] [they] could pet _, you know ,_ 
B|55| M:  ... 
A|56| B: _and_ [they] liked that . _And_ then on [the] way [home] we drove by [the] local high school _and_ there happened [to] be _an_ F A , F A A , Future F A , Future Farmers [of] America , F F A going on there , 
B|57| M: [I] 
A|58| B: _and_ [they] had all kinds [of] pigs _and_ horses _and_ goats _and_ sheep _and_ everything _, you know ,_ all out [in] [this] , [in _the] ,_ [in] [this] schoolyard there [. So] we just said , hey , let's stop _and_ _and_ [the] _kids_ got [to] go around _and_ _, you know ,_ _see_ pigs _and_ animals _and_ things _like_ that , 
B|59| M: There , 
A|60| B: _and_ _, and_ for them [that's] wonderful _, you _know_ ._ They [, they] thought [it] was [the] greatest fun _, you know _,_ and_ [it] didn't cost any money . _And _,_ uh _,_ you_ _don't have_ quite as much money when , when [the] wife _doesn't_ _work_ . 
B|61| M: [We] , 
A|62| B: [Right .] 
B|63| M:  ... 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: _It's not_ . 
A|66| B: [Right _.] Right ._ Oh , definitely motherhood [is] devalued [in] [this] society . If _you're_ , stay _at home_ _and_ _you're_ [a] mother [, it's] _like_ [what] [a] waste . People think _, you know _,_ you_ should be fulfilling yourself 
B|67| M: [I don't] , I'm [a] woman . 
A|68| B: _and_ _, and_ [a] mother isn't _an important_ [important] thing as , as having [a] career 
B|69| M: Because _, you know , you're_ [an important] , [important] [person] . 
A|70| B: _and_ _, and_ that should be first _and_ _, and_ children second . [But] [they] _don't have_ kind [of] [an] , [what] we call _an _internal_ perspective_ [of] things . 
B|71| M: [You] mean [like] , [if] [you _have] a_ _child [,_ [you] have] [an internal] , [internal perspective] ? 
A|72| B: [But] that , 
B|73| M: [And [,] [the] [,] and] 
A|74| B: _No . Right ._ 
B|75| M: [No . Right .] 
A|76| B: [Uh] , _at_ [this] point . 
B|77| M: [Well] [I] [, uh [,] I don't [know] .] 
A|78| B: [It's not] [to] say that some [day] [you] won't go back [to] _work_ . My mother's [a] school teacher [and] when , when we started [, uh ,] having _kids_ _, she_ had [to] _work_ for [a] little while , but then _she_ just started substituting . 
B|79| M: [Yeah [,] that's] [what] [I] meant . 
A|80| B: [So] _she_ would just substitute once or twice [a] week [, you know ,] just for that little extra money when we were [in] school . Then we would just come [home] [and] just be [, you know ,] go [to] [a] neighbor's house for [an] hour , then she'd be [home .] [But] _she_ wouldn't [do] that every [day] . 
B|81| M: Every [day] 
A|82| B: [But] now that my , my [, uh ,] youngest sister's _at_ B Y U now [, and] [so] [they] [have] no _one_ _at home_ , she's back teaching school _full_ _time_ now , again [. So] [if] [, you know [,] it's] [not] [, it's] just [a] temporary thing . 
B|83| M: N . 
A|84| B: Uh-huh . 
B|85| M: What ? 
A|86| B: [Yeah] . 
B|87| M: [I] [see] [, well] [that's good .] 
A|88| B: [Yeah ,] yeah _, you [,_ it's] [, it's] hard sometimes _at_ _work_ because [, you know ,] _people_ say , [oh] , we're taking [a] cruise , we're going here , we're going there [, you know] because [they] [have a] lot more money . 
B|89| M: [Well [,] you know ,] I'm [not a] crazy [person] . 
A|90| B: [And] [a] lot [of] them decide just [not] [to] [have] children . 
B|91| M: _The_ [world] [is] [full] [of people] who [don't [have] kids .] 
A|92| B: [It's] [, it's] amazing [, they] either [have] _one_ or none . 
B|93| M: _The_ [kids .] 
A|94| B: [And [,] and] _the one_ [person] [I] [know] that has _one [,_ they] [, they] feel guilty . She has [this] continual guilt trip that she's [not] doing [the] [right] thing [, and] [so] on [, uh ,] on weekends _she_ would [, you know ,] spend all [of] her _time_ with her [kids] [and] spend lots [of] , lots [and] lots [of] money . Basically [, I] think [they] [, they] really spoil [the] [child _,] to_ try [to] overcompensate for their guilt feelings . 
B|95| M: lol 
A|96| B: [And [,] and] [, and] [they] [don't] _want to_ [have] [anymore] children because [they] just [don't] think [, you know ,] that _, she doesn't_ think _she_ could be [a] mother _at home ._ _That's_ [not] her bag [. So] _she_ just _doesn't_ think that _she_ could [, you know [,] the] guilt feelings _, she_ can't deal with with [it] [anymore] 
B|97| M: This [, [to] ,] 
A|98| B: [so ,] 
B|99| M: That [, you [,] you] ? 
A|100| B: [You] [know ,] 
B|101| M: [I don't] [, she doesn't] [want to] . 
A|102| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] my wife [, uh ,] likes staying [home .] 
B|103| M: [Well [,] I] mean [, you] [are] [the one] who's [the [one] _,] right_ ? 
A|104| B: [Uh] _, she works_ _at home_ some , though . 
B|105| M: [I] _work [at home_ .] 
A|106| B: [The] place _she works_ with , worked with before , um , worked out [an] arrangement with her where [she] can [work at home] _, part time ,_ 
B|107| M: Uhh [, she works] [in] [a] restaurant [, part time [,] _part] _of_ [a_ family .] 
A|108| B: [and] [so [,] uh ,] that [, it's] kind [of a] seasonal thing . Three times [a] year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind [of] business , 
B|109| M: [That's] [good .] 
A|110| B: but [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . She likes [to] sew [and] [do] crafts [and] things [like] that [So] [she] enjoys staying [at home] , but [, uh [,] the] money [part of] [it] [is] [not] as rewarding , obviously , but there's _different_ rewards [, you know ,] _different_ kinds [of] rewards . 
B|111| M: [different] 
A|112| B: [Right [,] right] [, [right] .] [And] [you] really [have] [to] make [, uh ,] quite [a] bit [of] money . [The] wife [doesn't] make [it] worth [it] , with [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|113| M: [I] 
A|114| B: [I] [know] there's [, you know ,] when [you] adjust your income for [what] [you] put out for day-care [, you know , you're] only making [like] five .
