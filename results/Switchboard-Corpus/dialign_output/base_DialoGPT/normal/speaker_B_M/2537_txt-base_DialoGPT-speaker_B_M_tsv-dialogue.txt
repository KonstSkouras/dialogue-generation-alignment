B|41| M:  
A|42| B: Uh-huh . 
B|43| M: [It] 
A|44| B: [I] _really_ _don't_ [think] so . _Yeah_ . [I] _really_ _don't_ because , some people _are_ [going] to , _are ,_ _are_ [going] to risk [it] , um , [it] may prevent [, I [,] I] guess [, I] guess _what_ [I'm] trying to get at is , if [it] , if [it] , if [it] [does] help _a_ few individuals maybe , maybe it's worth [it] . 
B|45| M: [It]

B|61| M: [Uh [,] I'm not] sure [what] [you] mean by [that] 
A|62| B: [That's] right . 
B|63| M: They [don't] [have] [any] [left] . 
A|64| B: [That's] right . [I] even had friends when [I] was [going] to college who were in [, uh ,] pharmacy school [and] they could legally , um , provide medicine to their family family members [and] friends certain medicines were , were legal now [I [,] I [,] I] believe [, you know ,] [any] of [the] , [any] of [the] ones we would , we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists , 
B|65| M: They're illegal . 
A|66| B: but [, uh ,] um , _there_ were certain things [that] they could provide without [a] doctors prescription based on their qualifications [and] , [that] can happen . 
B|67| M: [Yeah [,] and] [there's] also [the] whole'you [and] [there] ' . 
A|68| B: But [, uh ,] 
B|69| M: [Well] 
A|70| B: _Yeah , [yeah ,_ I] [think] so
