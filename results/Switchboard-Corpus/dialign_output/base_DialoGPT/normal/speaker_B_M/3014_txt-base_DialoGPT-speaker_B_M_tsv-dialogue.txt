A|0| B: _Oh_ . 
B|1| M: _Yeah ._ _I'm_ _sorry_ . 
A|2| B: _Oh ,_ wow . 
B|3| M: _It's_ _an_ _old_ _car ._ 
A|4| B: _Well _,_ I_ really , _the_ last [car] _we_ _got_ _was a_ , _was _a_ used_ [car _.] I_ really _don't_ prefer buying _a new_ [car _.] _I_ like_ _to_ let somebody _else_ pay _for_ _that_ 
B|5| M: _I'm_ _not_ sure _I'd_ ever _buy [a_ used] vehicle , especially [a used] _one_ . 
A|6| B: _But _,_ uh_ mine _was a_ year [old] , 
B|7| M: [Well _,] I've_ _got [a_ new] _one_ [for] _you_ . 
A|8| B: _and_ _we_ _bought_ _it_ [for] very functional purposes , 
B|9| M: _That's_ _not_ [the] point _of the_ post 
A|10| B: _and_ _that_ _was_ _we_ _bought_ [a] station wagon . We wanted [an] economical [car] _to_ operate , 
B|11| M: Uhh ... _no ,_ _they don't_ . 
A|12| B: _but_ _we_ wanted [one] _that_ could carry _a lot of_ equipment . _So_ , _we_ chose _a Nissan_ Stanza wagon . 
B|13| M: uuhuh . Why ? 
A|14| B: _And_ _I've never_ _been _sorry_ ,_ 
B|15| M: [I've] [been sorry] 
A|16| B: however [the] need [for] _that_ kind [of] [car] has changed now , 
B|17| M: _I'm_ [sorry] . 
A|18| B: _and_ _, uh _,_ while_ _it is_ _still good ,_ _and_ _it's_ quite serviceable , _and_ _I'll_ drive _it_ until _it_ [no] longer _is_ _reliable ._ 
B|19| M: _And [,_ while] [it's] [still good ,] _it's not_ [reliable .] 
A|20| B: [And] probably then some _I'll_ spend _a lot of time_ praying over _it_ _before_ _I_ give _it_ up . 
B|21| M: Ugh . _I'm_ [sorry ,] _but _I_ don't_ _think_ [it's] worth [the] trouble . 
A|22| B: _I think_ _that_ [I] would _like_ _to_ _, if _you_ know ,_ _we_ all _say_ _, if_ [I] could _have _the_ car_ [I] always wanted [I] would either [buy _a] Nissan_ Maxima _, uh ,_ 
B|23| M: You're _just_ asking [for] _it ._ 
A|24| B: [I'm] sold _on_ Nissans . 
B|25| M: A _Nissan is_ _not_ _the best_ [car .] 
A|26| B: [I] [a] or , or foreign _cars_ actually _. Uh ,_ 
B|27| M: What _about_ ? 
A|28| B: _Uh ,_ 
B|29| M: [I _like] _the_ _Nissan_ ._ 
A|30| B: its reliability . 
B|31| M: [I] [have] [never] heard _that ._ 
A|32| B: Its reliability . [And _,] uh , I _,_ you know [,_ I've] read all [the] CONSUMER REPORTS _and_ things , _and_ [they] [just] run head _and_ shoulders above [the] American made _cars_ . If _Ford_ _was a_ head _and_ [the] shoulders above [it] , [I'd] [buy _a] Ford_ . 
B|33| M: [But] ... [but] ... [but] [Ford] ... 
A|34| B: [But] _I had_ _, uh ,_ _had _a_ Ford_ Escort [that] absolutely needed taps [the] day _we_ _got [it_ .] 
B|35| M: [And] [you] [had a] Pontiac Aztek _in the_ 80's . 
A|36| B: _Uh _,_ you know , I_ mean _it was_ ready [for] [the] graveyard . 
B|37| M: _It's not_ [like] [I [had] a] chance [to] [say] _that ,_ _it's just_ 
A|38| B: [And] _I spent_ as much _on that_ [car] [in] twelve months as _I spent_ [for] _the [car_ .] 
B|39| M: [I spent] [a lot of time] [on that] game . 
A|40| B: _So_ , 
B|41| M: [But [,] you know , I] _was ._ 
A|42| B: _and_ [that] [was] [just] trying [to] hold us , getting _out_ [of] [that] _was [a_ used] [car .] 
B|43| M: [Well ,] _it's not_ [like] [we] _have a_ choice . 
A|44| B: [And] _it was_ [an] older [car] , 
B|45| M: [I think] _you _have_ a_ problem 
A|46| B: [but] [, you know ,] Escort [is] supposed [to] [have _a] great_ track record as far as sales . 
B|47| M: _I don't_ [think] they'll _be_ cheap . _I'd rather have _a_ car_ _with_ [a great] history _than _a_ car_ _that's_ [been] abused [and] abused [for] _years_ . 
A|48| B: [But] [it's just] _, it_ [just] [was] [not] [and] [you] get stung [a] [time] or _two_ , 
B|49| M: [But] [you know [,] [it] [was] _a] car_ 
A|50| B: [and] [you] [say] , [no] thanks . 
B|51| M: _It's not_ [a] scam , [it's] [a] deal 
A|52| B: _So_ [, I] [just] trusted [the] CONSUMER REPORTS [and] [the] auto _, uh ,_ reports 
B|53| M: _Yeah [._ _I] [got_ it] from [a] consumer . 
A|54| B: [had] _my_ son who knows [a lot] [about] [that ,] study them thoroughly , [and] _he_ gave me four choices [of] _cars_ [to] [buy] 
B|55| M: [I think] _you're_ confusing this _with_ [the car] [he] [bought] . 
A|56| B: An Escort definitely [was] [not] among them . In fact , there wasn't [an] American [car] [in] there . 
B|57| M: _I got_ an'04 Mustang [. [I] think] _the best_ [car] [I've] ever owned [was [a] Nissan] GT _R_ . 
A|58| B: _Uh ,_ [the Nissan] came [and] , [and] [we] [bought] [the Nissan] [for] functional purposes [not] _what_ [the] CONSUMER REPORTS said [we] should get . 
B|59| M: Awwww . My _Nissan ._ 
A|60| B: [But] [it] served our needs _. Uh ,_ later [on] his reports , [the] reports [that] [he] studied showed [that _,] uh ,_ [Nissan] [was] head [and] shoulders above [the] rest [in the] [in the] class [that] [we] were _looking for_ . [And] [that ,] [and] [I'd rather have a] Maxima [than a] Cadillac [. I] really would . [It's not] necessarily prestige , 
B|61| M: [I'm] so tired . 
A|62| B: [but] [it's] comfort _. Uh ,_ there's [a lot of] features [on] there [that] are desirable _if_ [you're] _going to_ pay [that] kind [of] money [for] [a [car] _.] Uh ,_ 
B|63| M: Uhhh 
A|64| B: [Nissan .] 
B|65| M: What [is] [the] difference between [a Ford] GT [and] 
A|66| B: _No . _No_ ,_ [no] . [Nissan is] _Japanese_ . 
B|67| M: [No . [No] . [No] . [No] . [No] .] 
A|68| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh , 
B|69| M: [Japanese] [Nissan] ? 
A|70| B: uh-huh . 
B|71| M:  
A|72| B: [Yeah .] [And _,] uh _,_ if_ [I] couldn't [have] _my_ luxury Maxima then [I'd] [buy] me [a] fancy little red C [R] X sports [car] 
B|73| M: uhuhuh . _You know [,_ if you] _can't_ afford [a] Ferrari [, you] [don't] _have to_ . 
A|74| B: [I] mean [, you know ,] every every [one] [of] us _have two_ sides 
B|75| M: [So] _you [have_ two] [cars] ? 
A|76| B: [Yeah .] Now _what_ [about] [you] [, if you] could _have [the_ car] [that] [you] wanted _what_ would [you] get 
B|77| M: [Yeah] , _but I_ _can't_ afford [it .] 
A|78| B: [and] why ? 
B|79| M: [But] ... [you] _can't_ [have the] cat 
A|80| B: Uh-huh . 
B|81| M: What ? 
A|82| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . [Yeah .] See there , 
B|83| M: [Yeah .] Um . 
A|84| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|85| M: Uhh ... [Uh] ... [Uh] ? 
A|86| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Uh-huh [. I] tell [you] [that's] sad too because there [one] [time] [Ford] [was] [the best] , [that] [was] made . 
B|87| M: Uuhuhuh . Uuhuh uhuhuh 
A|88| B: Really [was .] 
B|89| M: _It_ [was] 
A|90| B: [And _,] uh , I [,_ I] really [have] [not] seen , now [a lot [of] the] American [cars] actually are , are , parts are produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled _here_ or vice versa . 
B|91| M: [I [,] uh , I [,] uh] 
A|92| B: Of course . 
B|93| M: Are [you] interested _in the car_ ? 
A|94| B: _Okay_ _Uh ,_ at any rate _do [you_ have] color preferences or _what_ would [be] [the] features [that] [you] would [be] _looking for_ ? 
B|95| M: [No ,] [I'm] fine . [I'm] [just] [not] [looking for] _anything_ specific . 
A|96| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|97| M: Hmmm [, you] ? 
A|98| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . [Yeah .] _Oh ,_ wow . We [like the] stuff [that] glitters 
B|99| M: [Uh ,] yes . 
A|100| B: Good . There's nothing wrong [with] [that .] Actually [I think] probably [if] [I] were _going to_ get [if] [I] were _going to_ [be] practical , which doesn't mean [I] would [be] [, I] would prefer white . Because , simply because [it's] more visible at night . 
B|101| M: Um ... [uh] ... yeah . 
A|102| B: [And ,] Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Now [the] interior , okay [, [I] don't] care [about] [the] interior [just] as long as [it's not] black or red . 
B|103| M: [Uh] 
A|104| B: [But] [if] [I had] [the] little red C [R] X [, I] guess [the] interior would [have to] [be] black leather [and] [I'd] [have to] live [with] [that .] [And] [if] [I got] [the] C [R] X [it] would [have to] [have a] real [good] sound system [in] [it] because [I'd] want [that] too . 
B|105| M: Huh 
A|106| B: [I'd] [just] _go back_ _to my_ teenage [years] [and] [just] throw all _my_ experience [to] [the] wind 
B|107| M:  
A|108| B: Uh-huh . 
B|109| M: _You [know ,_ I] _can_ [go back] [and] talk [to my] friends . 
A|110| B: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: [I'm] [in the] same boat . _I'm going to_ hang [out] [with] [my] mom . 
A|112| B: [That's] okay . 
B|113| M: Um . huh . 
A|114| B: [No ,] [no ,] [no] [. I] generally would [uh ,] prefer [to] _listen to_ [, uh ,] well [, I] _listen to_ K C B [I] [a lot] [but I] will _listen to_ [the] news [and] [the] , [and] [the] traffic [and] those things at work . 
B|115| M: [Okay] , um , [I'll] [be] [here] . 
A|116| B: [But] [if] [I'm going to] [be] traveling [in] [that] [car] [for] any period [of time] [, I] want some real [good] _classical music_ . 
B|117| M: Hmmm [. Uh [,] I] dunno . 
A|118| B: _I love_ _classical music_ , [and] [you] [just] [can't] enjoy [it] unless you've [got a] [good] sound system [to] produce all [the] , all [the] characteristics [of the] instruments . 
B|119| M:  
A|120| B: [So] [I] _do_ _love_ _classical music_ or [it] or , or [, uh ,] contemporary _classical_ . 
B|121| M: What [do you] [love] [about] [classical music] ? 
A|122| B: Uh-huh . 
B|123| M: What [is] this , [a] crossover episode ? 
A|124| B: Sure [do] . 
B|125| M: [Oh ,] hey . 
A|126| B: W [R] [R] [and] [the] Oasis are [the] [two] [that] [I] _listen to_ , more [than] _anything else_ . 
B|127| M: Do [you] [listen to] [anything else] ? 
A|128| B: [And] [I] [do] [like] them . [And] _I'd like_ [to] [have a] _compact disc_ player [in the [car] .] That would [be] , something [that] [I] would really [like] . 
B|129| M: [I'd [like] the] oasis 
A|130| B: Those _compact_ discs , really are [good] [for] [cars] because [they don't] melt , 
B|131| M: [I [like] the] ones [that] come [with] [the] ones [I] [bought] . 
A|132| B: [they don't] warp . 
B|133| M: [I] [have a] nice [compact disc] [, [I] love] [it [.] [I] don't] [think] [it is] worth [the] price . 
A|134| B: [You know ,] there's nothing [in] there [that] [can] wrap around [the] , [the] [, uh ,] rollers or [anything] . [It] seems [like] [a] really [good] answer [to] portable [music] , [that] [you] [can] choose . 
B|135| M: [I've never] heard [of] this [before] , [but I] [can't] help [but] wonder [what] [it is] .
