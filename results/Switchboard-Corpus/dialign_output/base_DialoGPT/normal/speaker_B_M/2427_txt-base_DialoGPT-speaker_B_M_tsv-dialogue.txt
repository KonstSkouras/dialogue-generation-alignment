A|0| B: _Yeah _._ _I_ have_ two plots , one's ten by ten _and_ one's _like_ fifteen by four . 
B|1| M: [I] _like to_ _have a_ plan 
A|2| B: _It's _a_ long_ skinny _one_ _and_ , 
B|3| M: _I _, uh ,_ uh_ ... _I'm_ _not_ _sure_ _how_ _to_ word _that ._ 
A|4| B: _Oh _,_ _I_ see _._ Yeah _._ _I_ see ._ 
B|5| M: A _lot of_ people _do ._ 
A|6| B: _Right ._ _Right _._ Yeah _,_ it's_ nice _to get_ out _in the_ open air . 
B|7| M: _I know_ _right_ [. I] _like to_ _fiddle_ _around_ [in] _my garage_ . 
A|8| B: _And_ especially _when_ _the_ weather's [not] _too_ hot or , [not] raining or whatever , 
B|9| M: [It's] _good_ 
A|10| B: _but_ [, uh ,] sometimes _I , I_ said _, I_ sometimes [I] wish [I] _had_ _more_ space _you _know_ ._ 
B|11| M: _Well [,_ it's] [the] _only_ way . 
A|12| B: [I] _grow_ _a lot of_ things , _a lot of_ food . 
B|13| M: _But _, uh , you_ _don't_ _have_ to_ _say_ _that ._ 
A|14| B: _And_ sometimes _I , I_ _want to_ _plant_ _something_ , there's _not enough_ room [to] _plant_ . Some [of] those things [like] [, uh _, you] know , the_ things [that] vine [like] [, uh ,] _cucumbers_ , or [, uh ,] squash or _something_ , [like] [that .] Plant _one of_ those 
B|15| M: _I _, I ,_ I_ [like] plants . 
A|16| B: _and_ _it_ takes _up_ _your_ whole space 
B|17| M: [I see .] _Well [,_ uh] ... 
A|18| B: _Yeah _._ Yeah ._ _They_ _, they_ _just_ run _all over_ _, _the_ place_ , [don't] _they ,_ 
B|19| M: _I'm_ _so_ 
A|20| B: _Right ._ _Right ._ 
B|21| M: Yes . [It's _a] _good_ garden_ area . 
A|22| B: _The_ basics . _Right _._ Yeah ._ _That's_ _what_ _we_ [do] _too_ . 
B|23| M: _I've been_ _doing _it_ ._ 
A|24| B: _Right ._ Peas 
B|25| M: [Yeah .] You _can't_ _really_ [do] [that] without [the] roots . 
A|26| B: [I , I] _got_ _a few_ peas out [my] [garden] [a] couple [of] days ago . 
B|27| M: _We_ _do ._ 
A|28| B: _The first_ _one_ _, they_ started _them_ indoors this _time [._ I] read [it] , 
B|29| M: Wait . Did [you] [just] make [them] ? 
A|30| B: _And_ [so] [I ,] 
B|31| M: You _know what I_ [like] ? 
A|32| B: [Yeah [.] [I] _, uh ,] I guess_ [you] _can_ _get_ _an_ earlier harvest by _doing that_ , 
B|33| M: _I'll_ _be_ _the one_ _who_ grows . 
A|34| B: [But , uh ,] [sure] _is_ [a] heck [of] _a lot of_ work . 
B|35| M: [I] _can't_ even _start_ [a] farm , [so] [it's] _just a_ farm 
A|36| B: _Because_ [you] _got_ _to ,_ watch [them] every day _, and_ _keep_ [them] watered 
B|37| M: Why _would_ [you] [want _to] do_ [that] ? 
A|38| B: _and_ [I _, _I] don't_ think_ [I'll] _do it_ again 
B|39| M: _Oh ._ _I'm_ sorry 
A|40| B: _Oh _,_ yeah _._ _Yeah ,_ I_ _enjoy [it_ [.] I] come home from work _and_ _, and_ [I] usually [say] hello [to] wife _and_ kids _, and_ _then_ _go_ out _and_ [fiddle] _, you know ,_ [just] walk [around] [the] _yard_ _and_ inspect [it] 
B|41| M: _Oh [._ Yeah ,] _I've_ never _been_ [to] [a] museum _before ._ 
A|42| B: _and_ [the] kids [want to] swing , 
B|43| M: [It's] [the] same [in the] UK . 
A|44| B: _and_ [I] push [them] _on_ swing . 
B|45| M: [I'll] play _with_ [your] _hand_ 
A|46| B: _And_ [I] [I] mow [my] _own_ _lawn_ . 
B|47| M: [I] _I'm_ [a] grown _up ._ 
A|48| B: _And_ [I] [do] _, I _don't have_ a_ sprinkler system [. [I] _, I] don't_ _enjoy_ watering . 
B|49| M: [I don't] , _I'm_ [not] [a] robot . 
A|50| B: Especially , 
B|51| M: _We_ _do ._ 
A|52| B: [Oh] [how] , 
B|53| M: _We_ [have a] water pump , [but] [it's] [not enough] [to] power _our_ water . 
A|54| B: [Oh .] 
B|55| M: [It's] _the best ._ 
A|56| B: [Yeah [,] you] _can_ [have] [it] come _on_ [just] early [in the] morning _. And_ _, and_ off by _the _,_ you know ,_ by _the time_ _you're_ [up] _and_ _about_ . 
B|57| M: i'm [just] kidding 
A|58| B: [Yeah [.] [I] , I] usually _get it_ started _for_ [my] wife 
B|59| M: _That_ sounds great ! 
A|60| B: _and_ [I _,] and_ she moves [it] [around] _ever_ other day . 
B|61| M: Ah [, [the] ,] _of ._ 
A|62| B: Uh-huh . 
B|63| M: You [don't _have] to [,_ _it's] _a_ good_ habit . 
A|64| B: Uh-huh _. Yeah ._ 
B|65| M: _What_ _do you_ [do] _for a_ living ? 
A|66| B: Uh-huh . 
B|67| M: Uhhh ... [what] ? 
A|68| B: [Yeah .] Sometimes [I] wish _I could_ _get_ _one of_ these [, uh ,] chemical services [to] come , out _and_ spray [for] weeds _, and_ fertilize _, and_ _all_ [that] _and_ take [that] [one] step out [of .] 
B|69| M: [I don't think] [I could] [ever] [get] [a] [lawn] _to go_ . 
A|70| B: [But , uh _,] they_ [want] _too_ _much_ money . 
B|71| M: _I don't _know_ [, I_ don't have] [an] excuse . 
A|72| B: [Yeah .] 
B|73| M: _I mean [,_ it's] [not] _expensive_ . 
A|74| B: _Right ._ _Right ._ [But] [it's] _still_ [be] quite _a bit_ cheaper _to do it_ yourself . 
B|75| M: [Because] _of the_ chemicals . 
A|76| B: _Right_ _and_ [the] weed come [up] , 
B|77| M: _What_ _do you_ _mean_ ? 
A|78| B: _and_ _all_ [of] [a] sudden you've _got_ [to do] _something_ else . 
B|79| M: [And] _now_ _I'm_ [in] _a good_ mood 
A|80| B: [Yeah .] 
B|81| M: [Oh ,] _right_ . 
A|82| B: [Well ,] if _you _,_ enjoy it_ _too _,_ you know [,_ _you] [,_ you] _can_ [get] out [in the] morning _when_ , [before] [it] gets hot _and_ _, and_ _do it_ _and_ stuff _, when_ [you] [only] [have to ,] 
B|83| M: [I ,] [too [,] enjoy it] 
A|84| B: _Right ._ 
B|85| M: _You're_ [not] limited _, you [have_ [to] do it] 
A|86| B: _When_ [the] days [start] getting [a] little longer _, you know [,_ you] _can_ [, _I] can start_ [doing _it] [in_ the] evening after work . 
B|87| M: What's [the time] [for] ? 
A|88| B: _When _they_ _,_ when they_ _switch_ [to _,] switch_ , 
B|89| M: [When] [you [,] when [they] [,] switch] 
A|90| B: [when] _we_ [get] _an hour_ _more_ , 
B|91| M: [I can start] working [on] [it in] _an hour ._ 
A|92| B: [when they] rollback [an hour .] 
B|93| M: [When they] roll _back_ [an hour .] 
A|94| B: _I don't know ._ 
B|95| M: [When] will [the] patch [be] available ? 
A|96| B: [I] [really] _don't know ._ It [just] seems [like] [I] here [it] _on _the_ news_ [the] day [before .] 
B|97| M: They're [still] [in [the] news] . 
A|98| B: [And] _, uh [, I_ , _I] think_ [it's] coming [up] here soon . 
B|99| M: Yea [, _I] [know_ .] 
A|100| B: [Yeah _.] Yeah ._ 
B|101| M: [Oh .] [Well] [I think] [I] heard [something] [about] [it] being [on the] website . 
A|102| B: Are [you] having any trouble [with] bugs [in] , [in] [your] [garden] ? 
B|103| M: [I have] _no_ idea . 
A|104| B: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [I don't know .] 
A|106| B: _Right ._ _Right [._ [I] , I _,] it_ seems [like] [they] come [in] spurts . 
B|107| M: Ugh [, it's] [not] _good_ . 
A|108| B: One year [I] _didn't_ put anything [on] _and_ [I] _didn't_ [have] any problems . 
B|109| M: Uhhh _, you're_ [not] even [on] [my] list . 
A|110| B: Next year _I was_ planting _some_ broccoli _and_ _, and_ _some_ [of] those _, they're_ called _cabbage_ , _cabbage_ loppers , or whatever . 
B|111| M: How _do you_ [plant] [cabbage] ? 
A|112| B: _They were_ _just covered_ [with] [them] , 
B|113| M: How did [they] _get that_ ? 
A|114| B: [I mean [,] I] went [up] [, I] _didn't_ [go] out there [for] [about] three days _, you know ,_ because [I _,] and_ [I] went out there [one] day _and_ [the] _plant was_ nothing left [but] _a stem_ , 
B|115| M: [The] plants . 
A|116| B: [they] devoured [it] [that] quickly . 
B|117| M: [The] [plant _was] [just_ covered] [in] leaves [, it] [didn't] even [have [a] stem] 
A|118| B: [And] _, [they_ _,] [they_ ,] [have a] [, [you] ,] [a good] appetite 
B|119| M: [They] [have a] great sense [of] humor . 
A|120| B: [And] [they] [would] _, you [know [,_ I] , I] picked off [like] twenty [of] [them] _and_ , 
B|121| M: [They] _have [,_ you know , the] ,,... 
A|122| B: _yeah ._ 
B|123| M: [It's] also [, _they're] just_ _as much_ [a] threat [to] [your] crops _as_ _tomatoes_ . 
A|124| B: [They] _got_ [that] [, uh _,] what_ _is_ [that] safer _soap_ [, uh ,] B T spray this , year . 
B|125| M: [The first] rule [of] being [a] tomato [is] never [to] use [soap] . 
A|126| B: [And] [I've been] watching [them] every day _and_ [I've] _, and_ [I] _haven't_ _seen_ any _signs_ yet _. So ,_ if [I see] any _signs_ [I'm] going [to] spray [them] , 
B|127| M: [I've been] [doing that] since [the] [first] week [of] July . 
A|128| B: _and_ [, uh ,] 
B|129| M: [I've been] seeing [signs] [for] _years_ [, and] [I'm] [not] even [in the] UK . 
A|130| B: _Right ._ 
B|131| M: Hehehe . No , 
A|132| B: [Well [,] the] [good] stuff . _Right ._ 
B|133| M: [It's] _the best_ thing [ever] . 
A|134| B: _Right [._ Yeah ,] [my] backyard [is] [, uh ,] [is] sloping [so] [I] built [a] box [up] [, you know] _had_ [to] build [the one] [, the] low side [up .] 
B|135| M: [So] [what] [about] [the] wall ? 
A|136| B: [And] _, uh , I_ _had_ sandy loam hauled [in] [. I] _had_ [a] dump truck come [and] dump [it .] 
B|137| M: [Well _,] that's_ [just] 
A|138| B: On [my] driveway _, I guess_ [, that's] [what] _they do_ [and] _then_ [, I] _had_ [to] wheel barrow [it in] . 
B|139| M: [I guess] [they do] [that .] 
A|140| B: [But , uh [, you] know [,] you] [can] improve _your own_ soil there 
B|141| M: [Right [.] So [,] uh ,] they'll fix [it .] 
A|142| B: [but] [the] Texas soil isn't [the] greatest , gardening soil . 
B|143| M: [That's] [the] worst [I've] [ever] [seen] . 
A|144| B: [Right _.] And_ [you know ,] if [I , I] [didn't] _wait_ five [years] [for] _it _to_ be_ [good] [enough] _grow_ [you [know] what [I] mean] 
B|145| M: _I [know_ ,] [but] _you have_ _no_ idea [how] [much] [it] cost [to [get] [it] _to] grow_ 
A|146| B: Uh-huh . Do [you [have] ,] [do [you] [have] a] rotor tiller ? 
B|147| M: [I don't] . 
A|148| B: Small [enough] [, you [have] a] , [just] [do it] by [hand] ? 
B|149| M: Why ???! Why ? 
A|150| B: [Yeah .] 
B|151| M:  ... [so] ? 
A|152| B: [Yeah _.] Yeah ._ 
B|153| M: [Oh] ? [I think] [that] [was] [the] last job [I] [ever] [had] . 
A|154| B: [Yeah .] I'd [like [to] get] _one of_ these little small ones , [that] [you] [see] [in] _all_ these gardening magazines . 
B|155| M: [I don't have] _one ._ 
A|156| B: [And] [it] weighs twenty pounds or , [something] [like] [that .] 
B|157| M: [That's] [a] big yellow'a ' . 
A|158| B: My neighbor across [the] street has [one .] He always uses [it to] dethatch his [lawn] , 
B|159| M: You [don't have a] [yard] ? 
A|160| B: [I see] him out there , 
B|161| M: [The] dog [is] [in the] background . 
A|162| B: [and] [I guess] [it] has [a] thatcher attachment [to] [it .] 
B|163| M: [It's a] sniper rifle . 
A|164| B: [Yeah _.] Yeah ._ 
B|165| M: [I see .] 
A|166| B: _I have a_ friend [who] has [one] [and] [, and] he lets me [, you know ,] [no] problem borrowing if [it's] , [just a] hassle [when] [you know ,] [to go] [up] 
B|167| M: How [do you] [keep] [your] phone unlocked ? 
A|168| B: [and] [it's a] fairly large [one] [to ,] heave [it] [up] into [the] [back] [of the] van , bring [it] home [and] , check [it] [back] [and] [just] grab [it] [, you know ,] if [I ,] [just] [go] [to] [my garage] [and] grab [it .] 
B|169| M: [Yeah , _I] [know_ .] 
A|170| B: [That] [would] [be] nice . 
B|171| M: [I'll] [have to] look [up] [how] [to do it] 
A|172| B: Uh-huh . 
B|173| M: You've [had] [the] _green_ grass [for] [years] . 
A|174| B: [What] [have] [you] _got_ growing [right] [now] ?

A|196| B: [Yeah [.] [I] , uh ,] those onions [, [I] think] _, we [,_ we] planted [like] twice [as much] this year because [, you know [,] we] [got] , onions [and they] lasted from [, you know ,] [about] [when] [you] harvest [them] [about] [a] month from [now] or [so] , or six weeks , from [now] , until , until [like] October , 
B|197| M: [Oh ,] okay .

B|203| M: [I'm] [so] proud [of] [you] 
A|204| B: [and] [, and] [it] [was just] [like] everything [you] put [it] into tasted [so] [much] better .
