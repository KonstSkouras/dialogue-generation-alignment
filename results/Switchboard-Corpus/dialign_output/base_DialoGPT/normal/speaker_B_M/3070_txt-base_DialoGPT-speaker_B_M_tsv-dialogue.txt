B|50| M: [I] _know ,_ right ? 
A|51| B: [but] _there_ [are] others [in the] family who [do] them better .

B|66| M:  
A|67| B: _and_ [they] plan [the] reunions [, the] organize [the] , [you [know] ,] who [is] going [to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot gets [there] , who's going [to] rent [the] tables , who's going [to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware gets turned [back] [to the] caterer . [Uh _,] and_ each year it's done [a little] bit differently , because [different] people serve [in] those roles . 
B|68| M: ' 
A|69| B: [We have a] biographer who , who continues every year [to] save clippings on [any] family member _, and_ they're entered into [a] , [a] wonderful , uh , scrap book . _And_ pictures [of] new babies _and_ new people who [have] [been] added _and _,_ and_ obituaries [to] those who [are] gone . _And_ [it] keeps [the] family alive , even , [you [know] ,] even though it's very fluid . 
B|70| M:  _, and ,_ 
A|71| B: _And_ they're very dedicated [to] [that] [, and ,] uh , it's [been] really wonderful . It helps [you] hang onto your roots . 
B|72| M:  ... 
A|73| B: _And_ [it] helps [you] feel [a] strong sense [of] belonging . My husband , on [the] other hand , [was] [not] very close [to] his family . His family [was] very scattered [and] very diverse . 
B|74| M: [I] felt . 
A|75| B: "And [I] asked him , [I] got [to] talking [to] him , [I said] , [well] , [how] [is] his nephew doing . ""Well , [I don't] [know ,] [I] haven't , talked [to] my brother [in] three years . "" [I said] , ""Well , how's your brother doing ? "" ""I [don't] [know] . "" [Uh ,] [you [know] ,] my son keeps [in] touch with him , [I] [think] [, but] [I don't] . " 
B|76| M: Oh . 
A|77| B: "I [said] , ""Hey , wouldn't [you] like [to] [know what's] happening with these people ? "" ""Yeah [, but] [I'm] , [you [know] ,] it's too much trouble . "" [So] [I] got busy , got [together] [, and] put [a] _reunion_ [together] [for] his family . _And_ succeeded [in] getting [all] [of] his brothers [and] sisters [and] [all] [of] [their] offspring [but] one [to] our [place] down at Lake Tawakoni . " 
B|78| M:  ... 
A|79| B: Liked [to] kill [me] , because [I] [it] _was ,_ [I] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation , [I] did , [it] by myself . 
B|80| M:  
A|81| B: _And ,_ uh , nobody brought covered dishes . _We had a_ great big fish fry [, and ,] [you [know] ,] [I] fixed [a salad in] [a] number three tub . 
B|82| M: What ,, i ,? 
A|83| B: _And [,_ and ,] uh , [it] [was] an enormous task [to] bring [all] [of] those people [together] with just one or two people helping . _And ,_ uh , [we] _had_ [to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] [all] [of] them [and] [I] told him , 
B|84| M: [Right .] 
A|85| B: "We did [it] [that] year [, and] then [the] following summer , [we] did [not] [have] [all] [of] [the] family [there .] [We] sent invitations . [We] [said] , ""Please let us [know] [if] you're coming . "" It [was when] , uh , his mother , his step father _had_ died [the] year before , " 
B|86| M: [I] [was ,] 
A|87| B: [and] [it] , his mother [was] alone [, _and] so_ [they] came [to] support her [, and] then one by one , his [you [know] ,] his sisters , he began [to] lose family members , 
B|88| M: [We] . 
A|89| B: [and] [it] [was] difficult [to] hold them [together] . _And_ then , [of] course , he died two years ago [, so] , [you [know] ,] [that] family has gone down [to] one brother [and] one sister [now .] 
B|90| M: [And ,] 
A|91| B: [And ,] uh , [it] , [I] [think] [that's] [what] happens [when] [they] get scattered [, the] [, the] family unit , [you [know] ,] falls , into disrepair . 
B|92| M:  
A|93| B: Uh-huh . 
B|94| M: Heh , [what] ? 
A|95| B: Uh-huh . 
B|96| M: [We had a] [second] [reunion] 
A|97| B: Uh-huh . 
B|98| M:  ... [and [so] it] wound [up] . 
A|99| B: Uh-huh . [Well ,] see , [we] manage , those people who [are] at [that] core group manage [to] keep , keep [the] vigor alive . They'll send out news bulletins . Two or three times [a] year you'll get [a] news hey , guess who got , [you [know] ,] elected [to the] legislature , or guess who our local sheriff ,
