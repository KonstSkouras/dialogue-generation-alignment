A|24| B: Yeah . Yeah . 
B|25| M: Are [you] referring _to [the_ damage] ?

B|27| M:  ... [what] ? 
A|28| B: Well , [I] was just talking about any company . Uh , let's just say _a_ lumber manufacturing company 
B|29| M: Umm [. I think] I'd [be] okay [with that .] 
A|30| B: _and ,_ uh , somebody [is] on [the] premises 
B|31| M:  ... [and , and [,] you know ,] 
A|32| B: [and] one of [the] employees actually [is] driving by [with] _a_ forklift [and] he pushes [the] wrong button [and] he drops _a_ load of lumber on somebody [and] _it_ injures , them . 
B|33| M: It's [not] [a] coincidence . 
A|34| B: Sure . Insurance should pay for [that .] 
B|35| M: Not sure [if] you're serious . 
A|36| B: Well I'm [not] talking about any loss [.

And then _they_ [are] awarding [a] second amount as punishment [to the] company which [is] [a] usually [a] lot less . But [it's] an , an amount they're , designed [to] sting them [a] little for their , negligence . For gross wanton negligence in [a] claim . 
B|37| M:  
A|38| B: And unfortunately [the] [the] , lately [the] courts [have] been deciding [that] those could [be paid] for by insurance too . 
B|39| M: self . 
A|40| B: So again , _it_ never really penalizes , [the] company doing [the] wrong . 
B|41| M: It's [a] . 
A|42| B: [They] can go right on doing [the] same old thing _they_ always used [to] . 
B|43| M: What [if they] can't afford [it] ? 
A|44| B: And [if] , [if they] [know] some practice [is] wrong [, you know ,] I'm [not] talking about your isolated occurrences , I'm talking more about [the] [, you know ,] [the] thing [that] [they] [know ,] maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] [know] [is] hurting [people] out _there_ [and] [they] continue [to] do [it] even after [they] become aware of [that .] 
B|45| M: Yes , [but] [the] risk [is] still [there .]
