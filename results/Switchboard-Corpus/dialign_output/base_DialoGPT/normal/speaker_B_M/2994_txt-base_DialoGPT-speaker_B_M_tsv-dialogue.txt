A|2| B: You're supposed _to_ what . 
B|3| M: I'm [not] sure _about_

A|8| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|9| M: Well , _I_ mean _, they_ [do] _have_ paper bags _in_ [them .] 
A|10| B: We _, we_ usually collect _a_ , [you] _know_ , collect _a_ quite _a bit_ and then _we_ take [them] , take _them in_ . 
B|11| M: I've never heard [of] _that_ . 
A|12| B: _Yeah _, we_ don't _,_ we don't ,_ um , _use_ aluminum cans , 
B|13| M: [Yeah , we] don ' , _we're_ [not] [a lot of people] , but _we're_ _the_ [people] [we] [are]

B|17| M: So , _we're_ [like] the'do'thing , _right_ ? 
A|18| B: _And_ _I know_ [a lot of people] [it] would , would solve [the] convenience problem _if_ [they] had curbside pickup and some communities [are] trying _to_ [do] [that] now _.

B|19| M:  
A|20| B: [they] [, they] charged [you] by , by weight [of] how much trash [you] were actually sending _to_ [a] land fill . 
B|21| M: [But] [it's] still [not] _the same_ as [a] [recycling] center . 
A|22| B: That [that] might be [a] better way _to_ [do] [it .] 
B|23| M: [You] could [use] [a] yard sale or something . 
A|24| B: _And_ then [people] would , would _know_ [that] [it] _was_ going _to_ cost [them] _money_ _to_ [not] sort their trash . 
B|25| M: They could _just_ put [a] filter on [it .] 
A|26| B: [You] _know_ , because then [it] would , then [it] would _make_ monetary sense _to_ [them] , [you] _know_ , _to_ say , hey , [you] _know_ , _if_ [I] [just] spend _the time_ _to_ , _to_ sort this out where this stuff [can] be recycled then [I don't] _have to pay_ _for them_ hauling [it] off . 
B|27| M: It's [a bit] [of] [a] dilemma . 
A|28| B: Uh-huh . 
B|29| M: Ya .... 
A|30| B: Oh , yeah that's [about] [the same] kind [of] _thing ._

A|40| B: Uh-huh .

A|46| B: [Yeah ,] that's true . 
B|47| M: It's [the] [recycling] [thing] 
A|48| B: [Um ,] now [I] didn't _know_ [that] , cause [we] [just] usually [if] [we're] going [to] [, uh ,] buy sodas they're [in the] , [the] two liter bottles .
