A|20| B: Right . _Well_ , [the reason] why [we] _play over_ [there is because] its _where_ , since [we] [are] [a] Garland resident , they gave us [a] special deal _where_ [you] [can] [get] [, uh ,] ten [rounds] _of golf_ for [a] hundred dollars , yeah , [a] hundred dollars cause [it] [is] half price what [the] normal green fees [are] .

A|48| B: Right . [Yeah ,] [I] know what [you mean]

I] didn't [do] anything [to] them so they [are] [, uh ,] they [are] [good] [to] plant [in the] winter time . [They] last for [a] long time then . [So] , if [you] start putting them , [you] know , [you] [can] put them [out in the] spring too [, but] once [it] starts getting real hot then [it] just kills them cause they can't stand [the] hot weather . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| B: [No] , they won't make [it] through [the] summer [because] [it] gets too hot [, but] they make [it] through [probably] winter [and] spring . [So] ,

B|67| M: i
