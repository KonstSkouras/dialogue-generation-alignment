B|18| M: It [was outside] . 
A|19| B: _Yeah , I_ [, I] , _think , you know [,_ I] like dogs [, but [I] think] [that] , uh [, I'm] , kind of like big big dogs [and] [you have to have] room for them . 
B|20| M: i' 
A|21| B: [And] dogs take [a] lot of , [a] lot more care than [cats] do .

A|29| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|30| M: Pet 
A|31| B: Well if you're , if you're [going [to] have a] pet , [and] [not] [have] it neutered or spayed [you] need [to] be willing [to] _, you know_ deal with [the] consequences , take care of [the] offspring 
B|32| M: [I'm] 
A|33| B: _and ,_ [and _I] think , you know ,_ 
B|34| M: [And [,] [I] think , you know ,]
