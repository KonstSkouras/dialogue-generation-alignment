B|15| M: _I think_ _you_ are talking _about_ _the_ military . 
A|16| B: Yeah . Definitely [I think] _that_ there's _probably_ [a] lot [of] _waste_ _in_ defense and _in_ government funded research _in_ [the] first place . 
B|17| M: [I] _know_ . That's why [I] said _it_ .

B|33| M: Uuhh [. Uh ,] [it's] [not] [like] they are doing anything . 
A|34| B: [I] mean when [you] look at [something] [like] [the] Gulf War [it] cost us God knows how much . [You know] , at [a] million dollars , [a] pop [for] patriot missiles .
