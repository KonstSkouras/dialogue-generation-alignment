B|3| M: he's _a_ redditor . 
A|4| B: Well _I [have_ a] bunch _of_ _computer_ journals because _I'm_ _in_ _computer_ science 
B|5| M: Why _are_ _you_ _so_ awesome ? 
A|6| B: _but_ beyond that , uh , lately _I've_ _been_ reading , _I've always_ liked _the_ NEW YORKER . 
B|7| M: _Yeah_ _, you_ _do ._ 
A|8| B: my wife _also_ gets _a lot _of_ the_ _food magazines ._ BON APPETITE _, and_ FOOD AND WINE _and_ GOURMET .

B|13| M: _I like_ her . 
A|14| B: Do [you] _read a_ newspaper ? 
B|15| M: [I] [read [a] lot of] newspapers , [but] [I'm] _not_ _one _of_ them ._ 
A|16| B: [Yeah] . larger _computer_ _ones_ . 
B|17| M: Like [a] [computer] ? 
A|18| B: [I] haven't bought _it_ now for about eight years . But _when_ [I] used [to] get _it_ , _it_ was about five hundred pages , about three hundred [of them] advertising . 
B|19| M: [I have] [it] _on_ [a] [computer] [, _and] it's_ pretty great . 
A|20| B: That , that _half_ _the fun_ is finding out what all _the_ products [are] . 
B|21| M: _I think_ [you] mean [the] [half] [of [the] fun] . 
A|22| B: But [, you] know , some [of the] get ridiculous . TRAVEL AND LEISURE , all [of the] AMERICAN EXPRESS [magazines] 
B|23| M: [Yeah] , [but] _they're_ [also] [the] [ones] _who_ [read] [the] _articles_ . 
A|24| B: [so] TRAVEL AND LEISURE , FOOD AND WINE _and [I_ think] _they_ [have] some others , uh , certainly [half] [the] pages [and] maybe _more_ [are] pure ads plus _they_ [have] [the] advertising supplement sections that [are] supposed [to] look [like] [articles] [but] [are] paid for [and] _they_ _don't_ care if _they_ make _any_ money [on] [the] _magazine_ subscription , [they're] making everything [on] ads . 
B|25| M:  ... 
A|26| B: Uh-huh . Have [you] ever , uh , [read] or subscribe [to] CONSUMER REPORTS for _any_ length [of] time ? 
B|27| M: _not_ . 
A|28| B: But [not] worth _it ._ 
B|29| M: ' . 
A|30| B: _I ,_ [I've always] had this , [one [of] the] reasons [I like] just [to] pick up [magazines] [in] other fields is that [you] seem [to] get [a] very different perspective . 
B|31| M: _I , [I_ ,] [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|32| B: So [I've always] had this problem _with_ CONSUMER REPORTS that [in] [the] areas that [I] know [a lot] about [, I] _disagree with_ [them .] 
B|33| M: [I've always] found [the] gun [magazines] [to] be [a lot] [more] comfortable [to] hold than [the] [magazines] themselves . 
A|34| B: And _I always_ wonder whether there [are] _people_ [who] know [a lot] about every area disagreeing _with_ [them] [on] everything , or , or _what's_ going [on] 
B|35| M: Umm ... [and [I] always] [think] _it's_ funny [when] [people] say [they] [disagree with] me . 
A|36| B: So [I ,] [like] [I've] picked up now [a] subscription [to] [one [of] the] travel agent , uh , organization [magazines] [and it's] [a] ridiculous difference [when] [you] start reading from their perspective . Uh [, you] know , their major interest is [in] commissions [and] [, you] know , there's very little talk about [the] quality [of] places or airlines . Their major talk is about [, you] know , commissions [and] commission rebates [and] how [they] won't suggest hotels [to] [people] if [the] commission's [not] [a] , [the] full ten percent or whatever [it] is [and] [it] gives [you] [a] different perspective [on] what [people] [do .] 
B|37| M:  
A|38| B: Uh , some [of them .] The , [the] general travel [magazines] [do .] 
B|39| M: i 
A|40| B: But [I , I] usually just [read] through [the] sections [on] , [on] domestic stuff .

B|43| M: Uhh , [what's] your favorite [magazine] ? 
A|44| B: [Yeah] . _I don't_ _take_ much [more] [in] myself . 
B|45| M: You [take] [any] [magazines] ? 
A|46| B: Okay . 
B|47| M: [I don't] need [it .]
