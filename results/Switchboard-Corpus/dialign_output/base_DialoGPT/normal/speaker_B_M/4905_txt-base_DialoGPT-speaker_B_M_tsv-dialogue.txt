A|0| B: Yeah . Yeah , I've had _a_ variety of different jobs with _a_ various types _, uh ,_ in _the_ computer field . And so I've seen _a_ variety of types of benefits . Uh , I've worked _for_ , _for_ _for_ awhile _and_ they _are_ , _you_ _know_ , _a_ really academic type of place . And then I've worked with regular , _you_ _know_ , industry type places . And then with others _that_ _are_ kind of half way between _and_ stuff _. So_ I've seen _a_ wide range of both , _you_ _know_ , nonsalary type benefits _and_ other stuff , _you_ _know_ , _like_ health care that's either fully or partially paid _and_ , _you_ _know_ , some _have_ _like_ bonuses _and_ others _have_ had lots of vacation time but _not_ much other types of benefits _and_ so , yeah _, I_ would 
B|1| M:  
A|2| B: I'd say health care _is_ way up there , especially anybody with kids . Uh _and_ that's one of _the_ big things _that_ we always _look_ at , _you_ _know ._ When we , when _I think_ _about_ changing jobs _is_ , _you_ _know_ , _you_ _know_ , what kind of health care they _have_ 
B|3| M:  
A|4| B: _and_ does _the_ _company_ pay _for_ it . _You_ _know_ , all or partially or _how_ does _that_ work . 
B|5| M: yes . 
A|6| B: And _, uh ,_ also _, uh ,_ vacation time too _is_ _a_ , _is_ _a_ big one _for_ me . Uh _, and_ _I_ guess support _for_ whatever , whatever other , _you_ _know_ , kinds of professional activities _you_ _have_ at , _you_ _know_ , work . 
B|7| M: [You] . 
A|8| B: Uh , cause I've been at places which offer _a_ lot of support _and_ others _that_ don't offer any _and_ some _that_ , sometimes that's coincided with _a_ place _that_ offers more vacation time though , 
B|9| M:  
A|10| B: so that's _not_ so bad , _you_ _know ._ 
B|11| M: I'm [, uh ,] _good_ . 
A|12| B: [You] _know_ , it's kind of _a_ give _and_ take kind of thing _, _I_ think ._ 
B|13| M: Oh , okay . 
A|14| B: Uh _, I_ say _that_ health care _is_ probably definitely number one though . want _to_ just , _you_ _know_ , all your salary can't even begin _to_ pay _for_ what _you_ can wind up losing , _you_ _know_ in _a_ major illness or something . Uh . 
B|15| M: Hahaha . That's _great_ . 
A|16| B: Yeah . 
B|17| M: Uhh [, and] ? 
A|18| B: Uh-huh . 
B|19| M: [I] 
A|20| B: Yeah . Flexible hours _are_ , _are_ pretty important _to_ me as well . 
B|21| M: _But_ [. So] . 
A|22| B: Uh , cause _that makes_ _a_ big difference . My wife _works_ part-time . 
B|23| M: Well [, I] [have] [a] _job ._ 
A|24| B: And she _works_ [, uh ,] as [a] assistant manager in [a] fabric store . 
B|25| M: [I] [know .] She [works] _for a_ [company] [that makes] clothing . 
A|26| B: And so she [works] [a] lot of evenings [and] weekends [and] so two days [a] week [, I] [, uh ,] manage _to_ get home early enough _to_ meet _the_ kids _on_ _the_ bus [So] she _you_ [know] , goes in early those days [and] [works] _like_ , _you_ [know] , noon til close . Uh , so we [have] 
B|27| M: Erm , I'm [not] sure . 
A|28| B: Yeah [, and] being _on_ [a] , _you_ [know] , rigid schedule wouldn't , there wouldn't _be_ anyway _to_ _do_ [that] at all . 
B|29| M: Ahhuh ?? 
A|30| B: And _I think_ it's kind of neat _to be_ able _to_ spend _the_ afternoons with _the_ kids occasionally too . 
B|31| M: What [are] [you] [on] ? 
A|32| B: [I] mean usually , [you] [know] , [you] go _to_ work before they're awake or as they're getting , up [for] school [and] [you] get home [and] it's already dark unless it's summer time , [you] [know .] And even in summer time , sometimes [you] get home so late [that] there's , [you] [know] , [you] can't _do_ anything with them . 
B|33| M:  
A|34| B: And especially in _the_ winter . [I] mean , [you] get up in _the_ dark [and] come home in _the_ dark [you] [know .] It's _like_ , it's _like_ [a] vampire sometimes 
B|35| M:  ... 
A|36| B: Yeah . 
B|37| M: [I think .] [about] . [the] . [you] 
A|38| B: Uh , [a] lot of [I] guess _is_ . 
B|39| M: What _do you_ [look] [like] ? 
A|40| B: Yeah . [I think] some of , _is_ _how the_ [, uh ,] [you] [know] [, I] guess it's [not] really [a] direct benefit but _how_ your [, uh ,] performance _is_ rated [and] stuff [like] [that] at work . 
B|41| M: That's [not] [how the] study [is] supposed [to be] done . 
A|42| B: Cause I've been [, uh ,] especially in large corporations . [You] can really , [you] [know] , wind up getting , having , [you] [know] , real problems I've found out . I've worked [for a] few , [you] [know] , several thousand plus , [you] [know] , type companies . And it [, and] especially if you're doing [like] professional work . Where [you] [know] , it's kind of ethereal as [to] what you're doing [you] [know .] 
B|43| M: I'm . 
A|44| B: If you're , [like] I've [, I] work with [, uh ,] computer systems [a] lot [. So] it's kind of hard [to] say , [you] [know .] If you're , [you] [know] , [a] brick layer , somebody can [look] [and] see , [you] [know] , well , yeah , [you] laid , [you] [know] , fifteen thousand bricks today [and] they were all straight [and] your building didn't fall down , [you] [know] Yeah , [you] did [a] [great] [job .] [But] if [you] build computer systems , [like] , well , [you] [know] , what does [that] computer program really [do] , [you] [know .] Or , especially if [you] write [like] papers , [you] [know .] Or [do] design studies or something . 
B|45| M:  
A|46| B: It's real hard [to] rate something [like] [that] . 
B|47| M:  
A|48| B: It's [like] get [a] painter , [you] [know] , or something , [a] artist . It's [like] well [you] , [how] [do you] really rate , [you] [know] , Michelangelo , [you] [know] How would [you] tell if he was , [you] [know] , really [good] or so-so or whatever
