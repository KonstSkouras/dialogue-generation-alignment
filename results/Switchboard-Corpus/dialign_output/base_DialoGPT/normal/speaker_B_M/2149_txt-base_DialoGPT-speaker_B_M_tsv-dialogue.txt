B|65| M: How does [he] , [what] [do] [you] [do] ? 
A|66| B: [Yeah . And] _it's not_ , [you] _know ,_ we _don't_ promote [it] _a lot_ outside [the] community because we _don't_ _want_ recognition [for] [it] , [you] _know_ [so] much as , we [just] _want to_ help _people_ out . 
B|67| M: _I don't_ [get] _it ._ 
A|68| B: _So_ [it's] real _neat ._ 
B|69| M: _I am_ [not sure] [what] [is] happening . 
A|70| B: [It's] , [Yeah ,] 
B|71| M: [So] [what] [is] _this_ ? 
A|72| B: [it's] [like] [I] [say] _, _it's_ not _a_ lot_ _, but_ [it] helps _people_ .

B|91| M: [I] [got] [involved] [with] _it ._ It [was] [a] dance dance [, a] group [of people] [were] dancing . 
A|92| B: That's great . But [, uh ,] [like] , I'll agree [with] [you ,] though [, _I] don't think_ they should [have] [to do] _a year_ 
B|93| M: [It's] [a] [pretty good] _way_ [to get] into [a lot of] trouble . 
A|94| B: [Yeah [.] _I] don't think_ [that ,] some [people] _I don't think_ [have] [, uh [,] _a] year_ [in] them [to] volunteer if [you] [know] _what [I_ [mean] .] They're [not] worth [it] 
B|95| M: [I'm] [not sure] . Maybe [it's] [just] [a year] [or] two _in the_ academy . 
A|96| B: [Right .] [Oh [,] yeah] [, that's] true [, that's] true .

B|107| M: What ? 
A|108| B: [just] , pick up [and] head [on] out . 
B|109| M: [I mean , I'm] [not sure] [what _I] could do_ . 
A|110| B: [I] wish [I could do] something [like that _,] but I_ [can't] [, so] 
B|111| M: [Yeah [,] but] [it's not a] problem 
A|112| B: [Right] [, that's] [the] [way] [I am] [. I know] [the] [feeling] . 
B|113| M: [I'm] sorry [, but [I] don't think] [I] [can do] [that .] 
A|114| B: That's _right_ [We're] against [it] That's _right_ . 
B|115| M: [Well [,] I mean ,] [I've] never voted [for a] government [that] didn't . 
A|116| B: [You] , [too] [, and] _I hope_ _everything_ works out up [there] . 
B|117| M: [I hope] [so] [too .] 
A|118| B: [Yeah .] 
B|119| M: [So [,] I'm] [still] here [, right] ? 
A|120| B: _Good_ , [good] [, that's] great . [Yeah .] [Well ,] [good] _luck_ . 
B|121| M: [I think [so] .]
