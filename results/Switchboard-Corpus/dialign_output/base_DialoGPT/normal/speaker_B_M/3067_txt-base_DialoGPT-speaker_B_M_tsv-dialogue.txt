B|0| M: _uh _,_ and_ 
A|1| B: Uh , no , no _not_ , no , this _was_ , well _, I_ am actually _from_ _Mississippi_ _, and ,_ so _that's_ , 
B|2| M:  ... 
A|3| B: _it_ , _it_ _was_ _around_ there generally . 
B|4| M: [I] don't _think_ I've _ever_ _seen_ [it] before . 
A|5| B: Uh _, that's_ where _the_ family grew . 
B|6| M: _uh _,_ what_ ? 
A|7| B: _Yeah [,_ and] [it] _was_ _not_ only _in Mississippi_ , _in_ some other places , as well , 
B|8| M: Oh [, that's] cool _. It was_ [in Mississippi] . 
A|9| B: so [. It was] _, uh ,_ [it] [was] _a_ big deal , but _, uh ,_ they tried _to_ , _to_ centralize [it] [in] one spot . So , _in the_ past couple _of_ years they had [it] at _a_ _state_ park every year . 
B|10| M: [I] don't _know_ . I'm [not] [from] [the] [state] [of] [Mississippi] . 
A|11| B: We rent _a_ pavilion _and [,_ and] _do that_ [and] [that's] usually works out _to_ _be_ _pretty_ good . And _, uh ,_ they will rent _a_ pavilion on _a_ weekend [, and] [uh] 
B|12| M: _Yes_ 
A|13| B: [I] have [not] gone _back_ lately . In fact _, uh ,_ this past Sunday [was] [the] , [was] [the] reunion , but [I] did [not] get _to_ go . Uh _, I_ have , 
B|14| M: Oh [, uh [,] uh] . 
A|15| B: Not getting _to_ go . 
B|16| M: What's [the] difference between [the] two ? 
A|17| B: Uh , _just_ [, uh ,] [the] distance involved _and ,_ 
B|18| M: He smiles [back] [and] gives _you_ [a] thumbs _up_ . 
A|19| B: [uh ,] _just_ [not] _, I_ have [a] younger daughter now _and _,_ uh , _I_ _,_ it's_ kind [of] hard _to_ get her , get her there [, and] everything . 
B|20| M: Uhhh ... [uh] ... _how_ [do] _you [do_ that] ? 
A|21| B: _But_ [I] am _going_ _to_ , _to_ [, uh ,] hopefully next year get _to_ go [back] , cause [, uh ,] _a lot_ _of the_ family has [not] [, uh ,] on her side , _my_ mother's side , has [not] [seen] _, _you_ know ,_ _my_ daughter , so 
B|22| M: uuhh [, uh] 
A|23| B: [I] have one brother , so . 
B|24| M: _I know_ _. I know_ . 
A|25| B: [Yes] . 
B|26| M: Did [I] _say_ something wrong ? 
A|27| B: Right _, yeah_ . 
B|28| M: I'm sorry , I'm [a] little confused . 
A|29| B: Right _, _I_ _,_ I_ usually see her [a] , couple times [a] year so [that's] no , no big thing . _But _, uh ,_ _I_ , uh , I do_ _, I do_ enjoy [the] reunions . The only problem is [that] now [, uh ,] originally when _we_ had _them_ [, uh ,] they were mainly _my_ mother's 
B|30| M: [Yeah ,] I'm sure . 
A|31| B: [uh ,] father's . My mother's father's family had quite [a] few [, uh ,] brothers [and] sisters . 
B|32| M: What _are_ your fathers'fathers ? 
A|33| B: So , [it] [was] [a] large reunion [of] , [of] , [of] [that] group [, uh ,] [from] [that] descendants . 
B|34| M: [I , uh , I do] 
A|35| B: And [, uh ,] _a lot_ [of] those people have [, and] at time _, _you_ know ,_ they all knew one another . 
B|36| M: Uhh _, yeah [,_ uh [,] that's] _what_ [I] said . 
A|37| B: And now [it] has gotten [, uh ,] [that] [, uh ,] _a lot_ [of] those people [are] have [, uh ,] have died off , or _, _you_ know [,_ what] _we_ [are] left with is [the] , [the] relatives [of] , [of] , [of] [that] group . 
B|38| M: [But , uh [,] uh] ... 
A|39| B: And so _, uh _, it's_ not_ quite as close as [it] used _to_ _be_ . So [, _I] think_ people feel less [of] [a] desire _to_ _really_ go [. I know] [that] , 
B|40| M: Uhm 
A|41| B: Well [, [I] [,] I] _just_ [think] [that] [, uh _,] _you_ know ,_ at [that] when , when they were _you know ,_ [the] , those were all brothers [and] sisters _a lot_ [and] or they were all _in the_ same geographical location . 
B|42| M: [I ,] 
A|43| B: _You _know_ ,_ [back] _around_ _, _you_ know ,_ _in the_ twenties [and] thirties when they were growing [up] [, uh _,] _you_ know ,_ they were all located together , [in] one small community . 
B|44| M: [you know [,] uh ,] 
A|45| B: And as , as time grew _, I mean_ when time went on [the] family grew [and] moved away [and] so forth . And now when they come together _it's_ _, it's_ generally _, [you_ know ,] like [say] [the] kids [of] those people who [are] [not] _, [you_ know ,] anywhere near one another [and] [I do] [not] [think] they feel [the] , [the] closeness [that] they used _to_ _be_ there . Which is [a] shame 
B|46| M: That . 
A|47| B: but [that's] _just_ [how] [it] is . My mother [was] complaining last year _about_ [you know _,] it's_ dwindling down every year _, [you_ know [,] that's] _just_ [, _I] think_ [that's] _just_ 
B|48| M: [I think] . 
A|49| B: Well [, yeah] . [Yeah [,] that's] [, uh [,] yeah [,] [I] think] [that's] some [of] [it] . [But _,] [you_ know [,] I] have [, uh , [I] [,] [I] _,] it's_ _just_ [the] way _, [you_ know [,] [I] think] society is now , is _that we_ [are] [not] , _we_ [do] [not] have [the] extensive family _we_ used _to_ . 
B|50| M: [I] 
A|51| B: _It's_ more [of] [a] _, [you_ know ,] [a] smaller , smaller unit [, and] [you know ,] _we_ , _we_ tend _to_ try _to_ [do] things [, [I] think] with our immediate family , as opposed _to_ [the] extended family . Of people _that we_ may or may [not] remember or [know _,] [you_ know ,] very well . 
B|52| M: That 
A|53| B: Uh 
B|54| M: _That's [a_ lot] [, _I mean] [,_ it's] [a] LOT . 
A|55| B: Right , [it] requires [a lot] [of] effort _to_ , _to_ , _to_ [do that] sort [of] thing . 
B|56| M: Oh [, it's not] [that] bad . 
A|57| B: [I mean [,] [I] [,] I] used _to_ enjoy _going_ [, I mean] [I] still [do] kind [of] enjoy [it] , but _, uh , it's_ , [it] does [not] [, it's not] as many people there [that] [I] _really_ , _really_ enjoy seeing . 
B|58| M: [It's] [, uh , it's] . 
A|59| B: _You [know_ [,] [I] [,] it's] _going_ _just_ _for the_ sake [of] getting together [, [I] think] _for the_ family . And , 
B|60| M: [It's] [just] [going] [for the] sole purpose [of the] show . 
A|61| B: Uh , Um , um , no , [not] _really_ . [in] [that] , but , then again [, uh ,] well [, [I] _,] [you_ know [,] I] have some aunts [that] [, uh , [I] [,] [I] [,] I do] . [That's] _about_ _my_ mother's sisters _, [you_ know ,] 
B|62| M: You're [, and ,] 
A|63| B: but [I] feel closer _to_ _them_ , because [I] kind [of] grew [up] with _them_ . [But ,] [But , uh ,] as _, [you_ know ,] [for the] rest [of] [that] group , no [not] _really_ . 
B|64| M: [That's] 
A|65| B: Uh _, [you_ know [,] and [,] and] generally when [I] [was] growing [up] [a lot] [of] those people , [the] only time [I] [ever] saw _them_ [was] at [the] reunion , so [, uh] 
B|66| M: [You know] 
A|67| B: [you do] [not] _really_ feel [that] [that] _really_ close _to_ _them_ . 
B|68| M: [I think] [I] might [be] able [to] find [them] [in the] [back] [of] [my] mind if [I] look [around] . 
A|69| B: Uh-huh .
