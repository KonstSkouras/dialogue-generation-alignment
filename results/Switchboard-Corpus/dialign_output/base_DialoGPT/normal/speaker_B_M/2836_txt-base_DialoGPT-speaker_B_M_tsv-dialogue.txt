A|80| B: _Yeah_ . Makes [you] wish [that] had _, uh ,_ [still] had indentured servitude _, for_ [this] sort [of] [thing .] 
B|81| M: [I'm] sure they'll [be] fine [, it's not] [like] they'll [sue] [you] [for] [it .]

A|98| B: Uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [That's] [what] [I'm] saying . 
A|100| B: _Oh ,_ _my_ God . 
B|101| M: _And_ _we_ [have] [a lot of] guns [, you know [,] like] [a] gun . 
A|102| B: Right . 
B|103| M: [So] they'll wait [, uh [,] for] _someone_ [to] [do] [it] [, uh] . 
A|104| B: Right . 
B|105| M: This [is] [why] [I] always go [to] [the] bathroom [in the] morning .

A|112| B: [And] [that] _, that's a_ deterrent , too . If [you think] [the] home owner might [be] _armed_ , [right [,] and] awake 
B|113| M: [I'm] pretty sure _you're_ [not] supposed [to] shoot anyone [who] isn't [armed] _with_ [a] gun . 
A|114| B: _here_ [you] break [in [,] and you're] [going to] [get] shot . 
B|115| M: [I] [have] [a] friend who's [been] living [in] [a] house [for] 2 years [and] he's got [a] gun . 
A|116| B: Uh-huh . 
B|117| M: Heh , [the guy] [in the] video said [that] he broke [in] . 
A|118| B: Uh-huh . 
B|119| M: What's [that] ? 
A|120| B: Huh . 
B|121| M: [Well [,] that's a] [bit] _of a_ different story .

B|129| M: Uhhh ... [uh] huh . 
A|130| B: [Yeah] . Uh-huh [. [I] mean , I] [, I] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. [I] think] [, uh [,] [what] [I] would] [like] [to] see [is] , number [one] , completely getting rid [of] these victimless crimes [. Uh ,] there's [no] reason [to] enforce those [and] spend [time] [and] [money] [doing] [it] [and] [, and] worry [about] these things where [people] [are] getting hurt . 
B|131| M: _You_ . 
A|132| B: [And] [I think] [one of] [the] big things [that] [you] [can] [do] [is] , [to] increase deterrence [is] [, uh ,] [if] [someone] [is] found [guilty] [of a] [, uh ,] felony level offense , [they] lose their citizenship . [And] [they] lose their constitutional rights [. [You] know ,] 
B|133| M:  
A|134| B: [and] _just_ [a lot of] things [that] we're trying [to] worry [about] [, you know ,] protecting these [people] [from] _, we just_ [don't] protect [them] . 
B|135| M: [So] . h 
A|136| B: [I] [know [,] and] [I think] [, I think] [that's] ridiculous . 
B|137| M: No [, we just] wanted [to have] [a] conversation
