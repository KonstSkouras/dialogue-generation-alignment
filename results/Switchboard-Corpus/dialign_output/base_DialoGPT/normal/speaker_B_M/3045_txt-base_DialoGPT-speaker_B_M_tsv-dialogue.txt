A|82| B: [Yeah .] [I'm] anxious some day _to have_ [one] here . 
B|83| M: [Oh . I] am ? 
A|84| B: [I'm] [, and] they [just] talked [to] [the other] day [other] day [about] setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon [we'll] _at_ [least] [have] [the] word processing . 
B|85| M: [Oh .] Well , yeah . 
A|86| B: [My] nine year old [I've] decided [to] teach her [how] _to type_ using [the computer] , 
B|87| M: Well [, what] [is] [it] ? 
A|88| B: so . 
B|89| M: [I'm not] good [at] [typing] . 
A|90| B: [Yeah .] 
B|91| M: You [can] [type] [on] [the computer] ? 
A|92| B: [I've] , 
B|93| M: [I have] . 
A|94| B: [That's] right . 
B|95| M: She's [not] _going [to_ have] any [of those .] 
A|96| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|97| M: [Uh [,] what] ? 
A|98| B: We've [been] , we've [been] [, uh ,] writing _a story_ together . 
B|99| M: He smiles [and] nods . 
A|100| B: And so [I [,] and] [I] wanted her [to] put [it] into [the computer] [, and] then print _it out_ [and] , _make a_ book [with] [it] [, [you] know] . 
B|101| M: [What] ? 
A|102| B: And so [I] decided well , if [she's] [going to] [do] [that ,] [it] would [be] [a] whole lot easier if she could [type] 
B|103| M: [Oh .] She could've [just] typed [it out] . 
A|104| B: So [we'll] slowly [learn] [just] _to type_ here [and] then then put [the] _story_ [in] . 
B|105| M: [I've been] told by others [to] [make [a] story] . 
A|106| B: [Yes ,] yes [. _I] agree ._ 
B|107| M: [I agree .] She [can] still [learn] [to type] . 
A|108| B: [Yeah .] 
B|109| M: She shrugs . [I've been] [in] [a] relationship [for] [a] while .
