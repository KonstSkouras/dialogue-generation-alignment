B|25| M: [Florida] ? What ? 
A|26| B: Course _they_ [have] such _a crime_ problem [because] _they_ [have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
B|27| M: [Yeah .] uhh . You're _right ._ 
A|28| B: Get [that] unemployment _way_ _up_ [so] then people [, you know] tend towards _crime_ [, and] then _they_ _they_ start stiffening [the] penalties . 
B|29| M: [I don't _know] ._ 
A|30| B: _Well ,_ [in] [Florida] seems _like_ [, uh ,] two _or_ three times [a] year . It's constantly on [the ,] 
B|31| M: It . 
A|32| B: [Yeah .] _No _,_ that's_ true . Course _they_ [have] [a] requirement [that] [, uh ,] [that] every single _appeal_ must be permitted . 
B|33| M: I' , 
A|34| B: _So_ , [of course] _, [the_ _,] the_ attorneys , 
B|35| M: [No ,] it's _not_ . 
A|36| B: _they_ [go] all [the] _way_ _up_ [to] _the Supreme_ Court [, you [know] .] 
B|37| M: [Well [,] [the] Supreme] court _has_ no power [to] [appeal] . 
A|38| B: _They_ almost always _get_ thrown [right] back _out_ again _, but_ _they_ [have to] [have] every single [appeal] made open [to] _them_ . 
B|39| M: [I don't know] [about] [you] [but] I've never seen [a judge] [or] [jury] [that] [wasn't] _guilty_ [of] [a crime] . 
A|40| B: Some [of] these guys are really [, uh [,] you know ,] violent Son [of] Sam killers [and] stuff _like that_ [, you [know] .] 
B|41| M: I've never seen anyone [get] beaten [up] [like _that] ._ 
A|42| B: [I] [mean] _, they_ , 
B|43| M: _I'm_ sorry [, but] [how do you] [think] [they] [do] [that] ? 
A|44| B: everyone knows _they're going_ [get] , [not] _going to get_ _out ._ 
B|45| M: _And_ [they] [get] [them] [out .] 
A|46| B: [Yeah .] 
B|47| M: [So] [they] [get] [the] same treatment _as_ [the] rest [of] us ? 
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M: You [don't _know] that ._ 
A|50| B: Uh-huh . 
B|51| M: You [know .] 
A|52| B: [I think so .] 
B|53| M: [No [,] I think] you're [the] _only_ one . 
A|54| B: [Uh ,] [a] lot [of] [the [,] [the] [,] the] other violent crimes [I don't] really feel [that] strongly [about] . Although [, you know ,] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole , 
B|55| M: What [do you] [mean] ? 
A|56| B: [I] [mean] , these guys are certainly [not] _going to_ [, uh ,] be _, they_ can't [, I] [mean] _they're_ getting into drugs [and] fights [and] all [that] stuff [in] prison . _I don't think_ [the] parole system _is_ really helping [that] much 
B|57| M: The [way] [I] understand [it] _is that_ _they're going to get_ [the] same treatment _as_ [the] inmates . 
A|58| B: Reduce [the] violence [in the] prisons . [I think] _that's_ its [only] purpose [is] , [is] [, you know ,] [to] reduce [, uh [,] the] violence [in the] prisons [so] people behave themselves [a] little bit better if [they] [think] [they're going to get] off early . Off earlier . 
B|59| M:  ... 
A|60| B: But some [of] these guys _just_ [don't] care [, you [know] .] [And] [so] [, uh ,] 
B|61| M: [So] . [uh] 
A|62| B: [Yeah] , [right] , uh-huh . 
B|63| M: [I don't think] [you know] _what_ [that] word means . 
A|64| B: Um _, that's_ _possible_ [I] guess . 
B|65| M: Maybe he's [a] murderer . 
A|66| B: Um , [so] where [do you] live [in Pennsylvania] ? 
B|67| M: _I was just saying_ _what_ [it] [is] . [uh] 
A|68| B: _Oh _,_ okay ._ [I don't think] [I] really [know that .] 
B|69| M: _In_ [Pennsylvania] . 
A|70| B: _Because_ [, uh [,] you know ,] [that] all depends , too , on where [you] are at . _That's_ [, uh ,] sort [of] interesting [to get] opinions [as] [to] where different parts [of] [the] country are . _Because_ [the] more grass root country [, uh ,] parts [of] [the] country tend [to] , [to] support capital punishment , where [the] places [that] are [, you know ,] less [in] contact [with] [crime] [you know [,] [the] [,] the] more , more urban [, I] [mean] less , 
B|71| M:  
A|72| B: Uh-huh . 
B|73| M: _I'm_ . 
A|74| B: Two hours where ? 
B|75| M:  ... 
A|76| B: _Oh _,_ okay ._ _Near_ Polk ? 
B|77| M: [Near] Pittsburg . 
A|78| B: Polk Institute . It's [, uh ,] an old [, uh ,] university [that] turned into _a place_ for [the] mentally retarded . [Uh ,] 
B|79| M: What _is that_ ? 
A|80| B: Very old [, uh ,] historical _place_ there . 
B|81| M: [Oh ,] I've heard [of] [it .] 
A|82| B: Sharon , Pennsylvania's [up] there . 
B|83| M: [Well [,] that's] [not] [a place] . 
A|84| B: [Yeah .] 
B|85| M: [Oh] _. Well [,_ okay .] 
A|86| B: [Oh [,] okay .] 
B|87| M: _I'm_ [in] California . 
A|88| B: [In] [that] case , maybe [, you [know] .] 
B|89| M: [I don't [know] .] 
A|90| B: Right . _That's_ true . [Yeah] [, well ,] [it] , [it] [, you know [,] you] [get] certain circumstances where [you] hear [about] these people [that] [have] [, you know ,] stolen kids [and] [, you know ,] done terrible things [to] [them] [and] killed [them] [and] [, you know ,] [that] sort [of] thing , 
B|91| M:  
A|92| B: [you] [just] [like] [, I don't] want [that] person sharing [the] Earth [with] me [, you know [,] I] [mean] , [that] [is] [just] terrible . 
B|93| M: You . 
A|94| B: [And] [, uh [,] you know ,] [we] had [a] case [like that] here [and] , on [the] other hand [, you know ,] people are [saying] [that] [because] [the ,] he knows [, because] [the] criminals [know that] [the [,] uh ,] penalties can be very severe _, they_ [, uh ,] there's less criminals [that] are [, you know ,] turning themselves [in] , [or] [, you know ,] pleading [or] whatever [, because] [they] [know that] [the] [judge] [, you know ,] if [they] find [them] [guilty] [is] [, you know ,] [has] [the [,] the] opportunity [to] sentence [them] [, you know ,] for , for [the] death sentence . 
B|95| M:  
A|96| B: [Yeah [.] Well ,] [I'm] [just saying] [that] , [that] [, that's] [what] [, [the] [,] the] client , lawyers are _saying ._ They're [saying] [that] [, you know [,] you know ,] more [of] my clients [would] [have] pleaded [guilty] if [they] [would] [have] gotten [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly having [to] , [to] , [to get] [a] death sentence [because] [you] can't plea bargain [what] [the] sentence [is] [going to] be . 
B|97| M: no . 
A|98| B: Right , uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [They] ,. 
A|100| B: [Yeah] , [right .] 
B|101| M: [yeah] [, they] deserve nothing . [They] deserve . 
A|102| B: Uh-huh . [I was just saying] [that] [way] , [what] [they're] [saying] [is that] [they] can't [get] people [to] turn themselves [in] then . [And] [so] , [we [have] to go] through [a] trial then [to] prove [the] person's [guilty] . 
B|103| M: [That's] [what] [I was] [saying .] 
A|104| B: [And] perhaps [we] can [and] perhaps [we] can't [and] [so] [the] guy might [get] off . 
B|105| M: [Because] [it] [is] [possible] 
A|106| B: [And] [, uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] are turning themselves [in] are , are guys [that] are [, you know] [going to get] caught anyways [but] , There's always [a] few [of] those people [that] are [, you know ,] lost their head [or] whatever . 
B|107| M: [I] 
A|108| B: Anyways [, but] [, uh] . [Yeah] , [we] [just] had [a] terrible case [in] Virginia where some girl disappeared [and] [, and] [the] guy , [like] [I] said , he [just] [, uh ,] said [that] he took her [, but] he won't admit [that] she died [or] whatever [, and] he won't say where [the] body [is] [because] he knows [the] penalty's very [you know ,] mandatory life sentences for murder .
