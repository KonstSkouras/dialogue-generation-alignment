B|3| M: _Yeah _,_ I'm not_ [really] _sure_ _. _I_ don't_ [really] _have_ any plans [for the] next year , _so_ _I'm_ kinda _just_ gonna wait [for the] new year . 
A|4| B: _Well ,_ _a_ little bit [for the] price , 
B|5| M: How _about_ _food ?_ 
A|6| B: _but_ _, uh _,_ I think_ _that_ as far as quality _of food_ goes [the] _some_ _of_ _the most_ _expensive_ places I've _been_ had [the] [the] , [really] [the] , [the] worst quality _of food ._ 
B|7| M: _I like_ _to eat_ _at_ [the most] _, _and_ eat_ _a lot [of_ food .] 
A|8| B: Really . [Um ,] [a lot of] places _that_ even [don't] _look_ , [don't] _look_ [like] much . 
B|9| M: _I'm_ _sure_ [I] _can_ _find_ [some] 
A|10| B: Some [of] [the] , [some] [of] _the best_ [food] _I have_ ever had _was_ _out_ [of] [a] , outside _or_ inside [of] [a] place _that_ we drove up [and] _I was_ _like [,_ I'm not] eating _in_ there _Are you_ nuts ?

B|13| M: _I guess_ . _You_ ? 
A|14| B: [I'm] _serious_ . 
B|15| M: _You_ [serious] ? 
A|16| B: [Um ,] [a lot of] _, uh ,_ one place _that_ we went [just] recently _uh ,_ _was_ [to] Atchafalaya . 
B|17| M: She nods . 
A|18| B: _No _,_ that's_ [not] _right _._ That's_ [not] _right _._ That's_ [not] _right ._ 
B|19| M: Is [that] [right] ? 
A|20| B: someone _in the_ What's [the] name [of] [that] _restaurant_ ? _in the_ background Where [at] ? . someone _in the_ background _The_ Hari Krishna . _in the_ background relies _Oh ._ Kalachandji's . Kalachandji's . It's _all_ vegetarian [, and] _it ,_ _it_ _was just_ fabulous [. I] mean , my husband _was_ aghast because [I] ate turnip greens [and] liked _it ._ 
B|21| M:  
A|22| B: [Um ,] Kalachandji's . It's _, uh _,_ it's_ [a] Hari Krishna run _restaurant ._ 
B|23| M: [I'm] aghas aghaf .

B|31| M: [I] _can't_ tell _if_ _you're talking about_ me [or] [the] guy . 
A|32| B: That should _get_ _you_ close enough [to] , [to] _be_ able [to] _find it [._ _I] think it's_ _, uh ,_ probably listed _in the_ restaurants , _you_ _know ._ 
B|33| M: _Yeah , [I_ have] [to] _go to a_ [restaurant .] _I'm not sure_ where [I] _can_ [find it .] 
A|34| B: _But_ _it's_ _, uh _,_ it's_ [just] fabulous [food .] 
B|35| M: You're [the best] . 
A|36| B: _Well ,_ we [like] Arby's . As far as , _fast food_ goes . 
B|37| M: _You _can't_ really get_ [it] _if_ [you] [have] _no_ [fast food] 
A|38| B: _Oh ,_ [really] ? _Why_ ? 
B|39| M: _You_ _don't have_ _to like_ [it .] 
A|40| B: _Oh ,_ [no] , [no] , [no] . Someone has _been_ lying [to] [you] . What _they_ use _is_ roast _beef_ . 
B|41| M: [But] _why_ do [they] make meat 
A|42| B: [That's] _what_ , _Oh ,_ my goodness . 
B|43| M: Roasted [beef] ? 
A|44| B: [I'm] surprised . My dad worked [for] Arby's [for] several years . 
B|45| M: _So [,_ uh ,] [what] _are_ [you] _going to_ do _when_ _you're_ done ? 
A|46| B: [Yeah] . 
B|47| M: _He_ chuckles . 
A|48| B: _Well _,_ that's_ happened before . 
B|49| M: _They_ [have] [been] known [to] steal your [food .] 
A|50| B: [But] we [like] good [uh ,] we're , we [like] Mexican [food .] 
B|51| M: _I like_ [it ,] [but] _I'm not sure_ _why_ . 
A|52| B: And stuff [like] _that ._ And _so ,_ um , 
B|53| M: [Oh [,] uh ,] _yeah_ .

A|56| B: Like , [like ,] name one 
B|57| M: _I don't [know_ .] [I'm not] [a] doctor . 
A|58| B: [I'm not sure] [what] [you're talking _about] ._ 
B|59| M: [Are you] [talking about] _the food_ [or] _the [food_ ?] 
A|60| B: Huh . 
B|61| M: They're called'rood 
A|62| B: [I don't] [guess] I've ever [been] [to] anything [like] [that] _so , I_ [really] [don't have] anything [to] compare [it] [to] . 
B|63| M: [No] . [Why] [is] [it] ? 
A|64| B: It _would be_ good _I think_ , 
B|65| M: [I think] [they] [would [be] .] 
A|66| B: [uh _,] [I don't_ know] _how_ _expensive_ [they] [are] . It sounds [like] [that] [it] [would] probably , 
B|67| M: Hmm [, I] wonder _if_ _they're_ [expensive] . 
A|68| B: For one person ? 
B|69| M: [I don't] [think [so] , I] got [a] deal 
A|70| B: [Oh] 
B|71| M: [A] [lot of] people [have] [a] small family . 
A|72| B: [A] bit 
B|73| M: How [about] [you] ? 
A|74| B: [Yeah , I] [, I] won't [really] _be interested_ _in_ [going to] , _in_ [going] there . Because [, I] feel [like] [I'm] [, I'm] paying , [you] _know ,_ five dollars [for [the] food] probably [and] five dollars [for] something _that _I_ could_ [get] along quite well _without_ 
B|75| M: _You_ [could] [, uh ,] [not] [be interested] . 
A|76| B: [Yeah] . _Maybe ,_ maybe _that ._ [Yeah] . 
B|77| M: I'll show _them ._ 
A|78| B: [Yeah] [. _I] could_ see [that] , then maybe . 
B|79| M: [Maybe [,] [I] could] 
A|80| B: [Yeah , [I] like] [the] , [the] seafood [that] [they] , [when] [they] had [it ,] [you] _know ,_ [the] broiled , 
B|81| M: _You_ [know [,] [I think] it's] pretty cool . 
A|82| B: [Yeah] . Probably _that's_ true . [But] _I know_ [a lot of] their , [a lot of] their specials sometimes [are] fried things , [that] [you] [can't really get] away from [the] fried , 
B|83| M: [Well ,] 
A|84| B: Now [why] [would] [you] [go to a] seafood [restaurant] [to eat] _chicken_ ? 
B|85| M: [I know] 
A|86| B: [That's] one [of] my husband's pet peeves . [He] doesn't understand [why] somebody [would] [go to a] seafood place [and eat] either _chicken_ [or] steak , [you] [know .] 
B|87| M: Fish [and] chips . 
A|88| B: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
B|89| M: [No ,] [they] [don't] . 
A|90| B: [Oh ,] catfish [is] wonderful . 
B|91| M: [The] north . 
A|92| B: [Oh ,] [really] . 
B|93| M: They're [all] amazing . 
A|94| B: Really . 
B|95| M: [really] [really] 
A|96| B: [Why] ? 
B|97| M: I'll [be] here . 
A|98| B: [Oh .] Huh . 
B|99| M: There's [a lot of] water _in the ocean_ . 
A|100| B: [That's] too bad , because [I'm] probably [not] [going to] stop eating [it] 
B|101| M: [I have] [been] told [that I] _can_ [eat] [it] [without] [a] problem . 
A|102| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . 
B|103| M: [I like] [chicken] . 
A|104| B: [That's] true . 
B|105| M: [I don't [know] [,] I don't] [like] being _on the_ [look] [out] [for] people [I'm] worried [about .] 
A|106| B: [Oh ,] [on] one hand [I] see [that] [and] [on the] other hand [, uh ,] my older sister remembers [when] [, uh ,] [at] one point [they] _were_ taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [I guess] , had [a] half-life [of] , oh , five years [if] [they] sit empty [on] dry land . 
B|107| M: [Yeah [,] that's] [why] [I'm] confused . 
A|108| B: [So] [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
B|109| M: [Well [,] it's] [not] [really] [a] nuclear weapon , [so] _there's_ [that .] 
A|110| B: And then [they] take these things [that] will rust [and] [they] throw [them] [in the ocean] which [is] [going to] speedup [the] process even more . 
B|111| M: Uhhh , [they] 
A|112| B: [Oh .] And then [they] wouldn't [think] . [They] _were_ floating around [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them .] 
B|113| M: [I think] [that's] [how] [they] got [the] radiation . 
A|114| B: And this [is] before _I was_ _born_ . 
B|115| M: _You_ [were] [born] [in] 1988 . 
A|116| B: [So [,] I] mean we're taking thirty years ago , this happened , 
B|117| M: [Yes .] We did . 
A|118| B: [and] [, and] who's , [you] [know ,] [the] tuna [is] radioactive [to a] certain extent . 
B|119| M: [Oh [,] [I] [know] [,] [I] [was] just] wondering . 
A|120| B: [You can't] [get] away from [it] [so] [I think] , To [some] point , 
B|121| M: [But] what's [the] label [on the] label ? 
A|122| B: [yeah] , [you] [know .] [So] [there's] , [you] [know ,] [there's] [some] things [I think] we [can] we , [you] [know] we [can't] avoid [for] health purposes [and] [some] things [that] we [just] need [to [like] ,] [you] [know ,] this [is] [not] [in] my control . 
B|123| M: [Yeah [,] that's] [why] [I] said [it .] 
A|124| B: [So] [I'm] either [going to] [be] [, I'm] either [going to] starve [to] death [or] [I'm] [going to] [get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and eat] as healthily as [I] possibly [can] , [you] [know .] 
B|125| M: [I don't] [think so .]
