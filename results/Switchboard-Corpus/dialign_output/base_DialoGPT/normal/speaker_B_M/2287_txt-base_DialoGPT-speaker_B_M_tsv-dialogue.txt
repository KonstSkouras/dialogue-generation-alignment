A|44| B: [What] _we_ _do ,_ usually , [is] [, uh ,] _vote [,_ uh ,] absenteeism 
B|45| M: _How_ [do] _I'm_ going _to [vote_ ,] now . 
A|46| B: [and _,] uh , I know ,_ _here , you _know ,_ you_ [don't] _have to have_ any reason [, _you] can_ [just] go [and] [vote] 
B|47| M: [What] [do] [you] _mean [,_ uh , _I know ,] you_ can't [vote] [here , you know ,] no one's going _to _vote_ for_ [you] ! 
A|48| B: [and] [the] _polls are_ open , [what] [was] _it ,_ [a] couple [of] weeks [, the] hours _are_ [good] [and] _they're_ even open on Saturdays [and] [a] couple [of] Sundays . 
B|49| M: [I _know ,] I'm_ [just] saying [, you] can't [have] [a] referendum [, but [you] can] [have] [a] [vote .] 
A|50| B: [And] [so] we've got plenty [of _time] to_ go _, because_ down [here] [in] Houston [, it's [,] uh [,] the] lines _are_ long . 
B|51| M: [Yeah [,] but] [they'll] [have] [time to] finish [the] [race] . 
A|52| B: [So , uh [,] but] [, uh ,] 
B|53| M: [The] [people] [I know] [are] from Dallas , Texas [, and] _I'm_ [not] from Dallas . 
A|54| B: _Well [, uh ,_ I] recommend _it , because_ [you] [just] walk [right] on [in] [, and] [there's] usually [not] anybody [in] line 
B|55| M: [Well , uh ,] I'd [like] [to] [do] [that] . 
A|56| B: [and [,] uh [,] you know [,] that] vote's [just] as [good] as [, you know [,] the] one on _election_ day . 
B|57| M: _I've_ voted [in] [a] [few] [election] days [, but] _I'm_ still [not] going _to [vote_ .] 
A|58| B: Uh-huh [, yeah] . 
B|59| M: [The] first [two] [are] easy [, but] _I'm_ [not] sure _about the_ third . 
A|60| B: Um [, yeah [,] I've been] involved with [, uh ,] _some_ [of the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of the] , [of the] Republican party . [And] [it's] really interesting [to] see [the] process as far as [what] goes through as far as [the] voting [and] [the] [, uh ,] how [the] [, uh [,] the] _not the_ ballots [, but] [, uh ,] my mind has gone blank . [I've been] all evening [How] _they_ develop [, uh ,] [what] [the] [candidate] stands [for] 
B|61| M:  
A|62| B: [you know [,] the] views [, and [,] uh [,] you know ,] everybody gets [to vote] on [, you know ,] well , should he be [for] this [and] on [and] on [and] on [, and [,] uh [,] it's [,] it's] interesting . 
B|63| M: We [do [,] you] , 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: [You] [, and] . 
A|66| B: [Right .] [There] [for] [a] while [, that] would [, that] worked . We've [, uh , I know] [I] [have] , um , _I'll_ stick [to] [uh ,] _to the_ [, you know ,] sometimes _I'll_ stick [to] [a] certain party , depends on [the guy] . 
B|67| M: _I'll ,_ 
A|68| B: But [, uh ,] _if_ _it [,_ uh ,] gets down between [two] , then [I'll ,] [I'll] [vote [for] the] party _because_ [I know [, you] know ,] something [about the] other [guy] 
B|69| M: [Oh , yeah] 
A|70| B: or [, you know ,] _they're_ both [just] as bad [, and] [I'll] say , [Well [,] I [know] what] this [guy] stands [for] as far as [for] his party [, and ,] um [, but] [yeah] . [You] [know _,] that's_ _not the_ best way [but] , 
B|71| M: [Yes] [, that's] [, [that] [,] that] . 
A|72| B: But [it] gets _to the_ point where [, I mean ,] you've got _to have_ [the] find [the] [time] also [to] read [about [the] guy] [and , and] be able [to] find [the] _information_ [about] [what] he stands [for] . 
B|73| M: _yes_ . 
A|74| B: [Right] , or [what] you've heard on T V , which _I think_ [is] [just] outrageous . 
B|75| M: [I don't [know] what] [you] 
A|76| B: [I] [, [I] don't] agree with how _the media_ handles elections . 
B|77| M: We [have to have] [a good] story [to [the] people] [of] Iceland . 
A|78| B: [I] [, you [know ,] I'm] tired [of] hearing [about the] _polls_ [, you [know [,] you] know ,] this [is] how he stands such [and] such [a] day [the] way _they_ break [it] out , 
B|79| M: [Yes [.] The] [polls are] [what] [we] call [a] joke . 
A|80| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
B|81| M: [You] can't tell me [what] [to] _do ._ 
A|82| B: Uh-huh , [it] really could [, and [,] uh ,] then , how , sometimes , how _the media_ will blow things out [of] proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] [good] [and] dead [, and] _they_ keep dragging [it] on [, and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an [election] [for [the] guy] [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [He] . 
A|84| B: [Yeah ,] [so] [, uh ,] 
B|85| M: [I think] [it's] funny [that] [they're] doing [it , because] [they're] [the media] [, [not] the] 
A|86| B: They really [do [.] I] [, I] sometimes [think] [that] [that] should be limited more . 
B|87| M: [The] [media] [is] pretty much [the] only thing [that] [can get] [him] [elected] . 
A|88| B: [Oh ,] [yes] , or _they_ [, I] agree with [the] _freedom [of_ the] press [, you know [,] and] all [the] amendments [, but] sometimes [it's] [for the] public's own [good] [that] [we] [don't] hear things . 
B|89| M: [Well [,] you] [have to] admit [that they] [have] [some] [freedom of] [information] . 
A|90| B: No , [they] [don't] . 
B|91| M: [I] am [not] sure [if] [they] care . 
A|92| B: [Well [,] I] enjoyed [talking] [to] [you] . 
B|93| M: [You] [are] [a good] man . 
A|94| B: All _right ._ 
B|95| M: [I] guess you're [right .]
