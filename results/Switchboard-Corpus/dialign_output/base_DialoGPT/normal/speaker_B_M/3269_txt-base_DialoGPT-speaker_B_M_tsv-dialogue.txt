A|52| B: You [know] [it's] [so] exciting . 
B|53| M: [I] love [the] fact [that] he's wearing [a] hat . 
A|54| B: [And] when [the] Cowboys [won] [the] Superbowl _here ,_ [of] course , [they] put together some real cute songs , [and] [we] all ran out [and] bought [the] records , [and] now [we] feel [like they're] kind [of] [a] collector's item . 
B|55| M: There's [a lot of] stuff [about] [the] game [here ,] [so] [you might] [have] [to] wait [a] bit .
