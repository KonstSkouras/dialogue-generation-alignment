B|0| M: sorry 
A|1| B: Uh , it's because _I ,_ _I_ can't find the item that _I_ want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . So _I_ go outside the area for that . And _I_ think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what _they_ believe _they_ are owed even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . _I_ don't , _I_ don't think that that's my responsibility as a , as a conscientious consumer . 
B|2| M: [they] 
A|3| B: Well , _I_ think that if , if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then _I_ don't argue with it . Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh , _I_ bought this out of state . _I_ need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania . 
B|4| M: pox . anyways 
A|5| B: Right . But the point is is that businesses do that . The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . That's a cost of doing business . The burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer . 
B|6| M:  , What . Oh 
A|7| B: Uh . 
B|8| M: That 
A|9| B: Uh , do you mean businesses from the point of view as , of , of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax ? Or purchasing . 
B|10| M: [I] 
A|11| B: Yeah . See I'm unfamiliar with that because [I] don't , [I] never see that end of the business . 
B|12| M: [I ,] 
A|13| B: So , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . Uh , but , if that's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then [I] think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided . 
B|14| M: N ?
