A|0| B: _Right ._ 
B|1| M: _I_ _know_ _that_ _the jury_ decides . 
A|2| B: _Right ._ _There's_ , there , _this_ topic _is_ kind _of_ mute . _Uh_ 
B|3| M: What _do_ _you_ _mean_ ? 
A|4| B: there , there's no way . _We_ , _we_ couldn't survive _in a_ _in a_ juror _in a_ trial _system_ without _a_ [jury] . 
B|5| M: [Right .] 
A|6| B: _Uh ,_ one man _can_ _never_ _be_ , one man , one woman _can_ _never_ _be_ objectionable _in_ every case . 
B|7| M: _They_ are . 
A|8| B: _Uh ,_ every person has their opinions and that's _why_ [jury] selection _is_ often very difficult . _Uh_ . 
B|9| M: [We] don't . 
A|10| B: [Right .] 
B|11| M:  
A|12| B: [Right .] [They] shouldn't allow an _appeal ._ 
B|13| M: _I'm_ a'there's . 
A|14| B: Yep . 
B|15| M: Can't [be] legal . 
A|16| B: Uh-huh 
B|17| M: What [is] ? 
A|18| B: Oh , that's right . [I] work _for _a_ law_ firm 
B|19| M: [I] _was_ _at_ _the_ school . 
A|20| B: [Right .] 
B|21| M: The lawyers _have_ been involved [in a] lot . 
A|22| B: Well _plea_ _plea_ bargaining [is] _a different_ story . 
B|23| M: Because it's _the only_ option available _to_ _them_ . 
A|24| B: Plea bargaining [is] something completely _different_ . That , [that] actually prevents trials . Or [at] least speeds [them] up . 
B|25| M: If they get [a] [plea] bargain then they [can] [be] charged with assault . 
A|26| B: [Right .] 
B|27| M: _I mean _,_ the_ whole [system] [is] broken . That's [why] they're doing it . 
A|28| B: [Right .] 
B|29| M: It's [a law] 
A|30| B: Huh . 
B|31| M: [They] don't . 
A|32| B: [Right .] 
B|33| M:  ... _but_ [we] _do_ _have_ capital penalty . 
A|34| B: [We] [do] 
B|35| M: Why don't [we] _have_ capital punishments ? 
A|36| B: [Right .] 
B|37| M: [I] _think_ they're both guilty 
A|38| B: [Right .] When you're _saying_ as far as _the appeal_ , uh , procedure [was] concerned . 
B|39| M: It's not [that] they're not guilty . It's [that] they aren't guilty . 
A|40| B: [We] just [have] [the] case _, I'm_ _, I'm_ _sure_ you've probably _heard of_ Marion Berry . 
B|41| M: [I'm] not [sure] , I've [never] [heard _of] [the_ [appeal] .] 
A|42| B: _Uh ,_ his last [appeal] [was] , [was] denied two days before his sentence [was] up 
B|43| M: [Uh ,] what ? 
A|44| B: So _, [I_ mean ,] his [appeal] [was] denied and two days later he got out [of] jail For cocaine possession . 
B|45| M: _No_ , he's [a] minor . 
A|46| B: But , uh , [that] [was] absurd There [is] [never] , there [was] no reason [the appeal] process should [have] dragged _on_ [that] long _for a_ six month sentence . 
B|47| M: He [was] [on] probation . 
A|48| B: Well , uh [, the] [, [the] only] [I] [can] _, I_ [you] _know [,_ the] , [appeal] procedure [is] [the only] thing [I] [can] possibly [think] [of] . [Uh ,] like [I] said , as far as removing [of [the] jury] and having [the] judge sentence , that's absurd . _There's_ no way [that] could work . 
B|49| M: The [appeal] 
A|50| B: [Uh ,] [but] , 
B|51| M: It's 
A|52| B: Oh , exactly . 
B|53| M: _I , I_ don t [know] . 
A|54| B: Exactly . [Right .] 
B|55| M: It's not _about_ feeling good . It's _about_ feeling happy . 
A|56| B: [No] one _would want_ [the] job 
B|57| M: What if [I] told _you [,_ I] [would want] _to_ [do] [this] [for a] living . 
A|58| B: [Uh ,] and , [you] _know ,_ like [I] said [, the] , [you] _know ,_ everyone has their opinions [about] every case . 
B|59| M: [I] [know] . The majority [do] 
A|60| B: Oh yeah . [I , I] feel [that] everyone [is] , everyone [is] , uh , entitled [to] [a] trial by [jury] . That , [that] , [that] right 
B|61| M: [I] am , uhh [, I'm] not . 
A|62| B: Well [, [I] mean ,] were there witnesses ? 
B|63| M: [I] don't [think] so . 
A|64| B: [Right .] [Right .] That [you] can't , [you] can't remove [the jury] regardless [of the] case . 
B|65| M: [I] [know [,] I'm] [saying] [that] [you] [can] 
A|66| B: [I mean] [you] could [have] fifty _people_ [in] audience watching [a] murder take place 
B|67| M: [I] [was] thinking [of] [a different] scenario . 
A|68| B: and [you ,] you'd still , there's still mitigating circumstances 
B|69| M: [There's] [only] so many [people] [you] [can] watch [in] [jury] duty .
