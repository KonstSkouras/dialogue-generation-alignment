A|2| B: Um . 
B|3| M: _What_ ? 
A|4| B: _It_ terms _of_ handling _, uh ,_ acceleration , 
B|5| M: _What about_ _the_ speed [of] _the_ car ? 
A|6| B: [What about] Mustang G T 
B|7| M:  ... 
A|8| B: Those , so you're talking [about] ones in _a_ lower , lower end , price range . 
B|9| M: _I_ can't , _and_ , _and_ [you] ., _and_ . 
A|10| B: Right . _Well ,_ [you] can _wait_ till [you] graduate [and] you'll _have_ plenty [of] money , [you] can [buy] whatever _you want_ . 
B|11| M: _I'd_ rather [wait] [and] see _what_ _they_ do 
A|12| B: Right , would [you] use _that_ for city driving [and] _racing_ ? 
B|13| M: _I'm_ off 
A|14| B: Autocrossing _is_ , [what] kind [of] _track_ _is that_ ?

A|18| B: _Oh , really ?_ 
B|19| M: [Oh , really ?] 
A|20| B: _Yeah _,_ I_ would guess so . 
B|21| M: [I] don't _know_ . _I think_ _I'm_ [the] only one [that] thinks _they_ are [the] best . 
A|22| B: Uh _, I think_ [I'd] _like_ [to] get _, uh ,_ _B_ M _W_ or if [I] go [the] German route , which [I'm] kind [of] leaning towards _right_ now _, but_ _, uh ,_ or maybe [a] _, I_ mean , [a] , [a] Acura Legend . Uh 
B|23| M: I'll [buy] _it_ . 
A|24| B: [a] Lexus _, uh ,_ S C three hundred maybe . Something _on_ [that] order . 
B|25| M: A Honda [, uh ,] _Mercedes_ ? 
A|26| B: _You_ [know] , because your _B_ M _W_ your German cars _have_ good reputations _, I think_ . 
B|27| M: [Yeah [,] uh [,] I think] you've got _it_ . 
A|28| B: Yes . 
B|29| M: [I] was [the] one who bought [the] car . 
A|30| B: The , [Yeah ,] [they] , their , [they] _have_ [the] whole philosophy [, I] mean , [they] , [they] kind [of] even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better , which [is] kind [of] hard _to take_ 
B|31| M: It's , [of] , 
A|32| B: [I] mean _as_ you're walking through [that] little tour in [, uh ,] Munich _, it's_ kind [of] they're trying [to] brainwash [you] , too 
B|33| M: [Well] [I] was [the] one who told them [I] was 
A|34| B: [Oh , really ?] 
B|35| M: We were 
A|36| B: Um . 
B|37| M: _That's_ _not_ . 
A|38| B: [Yeah] that's , 
B|39| M: It's [the] same [as] [the] [B] amp [W] , [right] ? 
A|40| B: No _, it's not_ _realistic_ . 
B|41| M: _So_ [is] _it_ [realistic] [to] [have] Porsche Porsche [racing] [on] [a] [racing] simulator ? 
A|42| B: [Yeah ,] if [you] can afford [that] kind [of] [a] toy , then [, I] guess [, uh] 
B|43| M: It's [a] car , [not] [a] car . 
A|44| B: [Yeah ,] just work , short trips . No no heavy mileage . [I'm] putting [on] less than fifteen thousand miles [a] year . 
B|45| M: Do [you] [think] [it's] worth _it_ ? 
A|46| B: [So] [it's] pretty minimal . 
B|47| M: [Well _,] I'm not_ [a] car guy [, but] [I'm] willing [to take] [a] small loan . 
A|48| B: Lasts [a] long time . [That's] mainly [what] [I'm] looking for . 
B|49| M: [What] do [you want] ? 
A|50| B: [Oh ,] yeah . 
B|51| M: It's [the] same [as] [the] _Mercedes_ . 
A|52| B: _But_ , _But_ if , if [you] _have a_ problem with _a Mercedes_ , [you] [take] [it] into [a] shop , they're going [to] , they're going [to] hit [you] up for just all kinds [of] things 
B|53| M: [But] [I] [have [a] Mercedes] . 
A|54| B: Uh [, I think] , well , something [on] [the] order [of] [a] three series _, it's_ probably different . Once [you] get up in [the] five series [and] higher , then , all your repair costs go up significantly 
B|55| M: [You] [, it's not] [like] [the] factory [is] expensive . 
A|56| B: [So] [I'm] kind , yeah [, I'm not] sure if [I] [really] [want] ,
