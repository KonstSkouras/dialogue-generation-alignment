A|100| B: Right . Right . 
B|101| M:  
A|102| B: [Well [,] uh , [I] , uh [,] _yeah] [,_ I don't know] [I think] [the] old gas chamber seems [to] be about [the] most painless [because] [I guess] [it's] [a pretty] , [pretty] rough [thing] [to] be [, uh ,] electrocuted . 
B|103| M: [I don't] [think] . 
A|104| B: _Oh_ [, _yeah] ,_ an injection , 
B|105| M: [I don't] [think] [it's] [so] much [a] _punishment_ [as] [it] [is] [a] process [of] execution . 
A|106| B: _yeah ,_ [that] would be even [, _yeah] [,_ I] didn't even , [think] about [that] . 
B|107| M: [Oh] [yeah [,] uh ,] [no] 
A|108| B: _I think ,_ 
B|109| M: [there is] [no] way [, [I think] [,] the] US [is the] only country [that] [have [,] the] ratio [of] people , [to] each other . 
A|110| B: [yeah ,] _there's more_ [that] [don't] [have] [it] _but_ amazingly [it's] [like] [, uh ,] Massachusetts went back [, and] reinstated capital [punishment] , oh , maybe six or seven years ago , 
B|111| M: [there's more] [of] [a] difference between [this] [and the] death penalty 
A|112| B: [I don't know] _if_ they've used [it] since then since they've reinstated [it] _but_ [, uh [,] it's] on [the] books . 
B|113| M: [Not] sure [if] you're aware , [but the] federal prison system [is] [a] federal [crime] . 
A|114| B: Right .
