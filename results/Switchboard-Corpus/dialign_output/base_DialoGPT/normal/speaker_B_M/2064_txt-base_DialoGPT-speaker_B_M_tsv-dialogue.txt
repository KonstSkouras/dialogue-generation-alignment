B|49| M:  
A|50| B: _Yes ,_ [it] certainly does . 
B|51| M: [It's] , 
A|52| B: _Yes ,_ [it] _would_ almost [have to] _be_ [, I] suppose . _If [you_ ,] [if you] had [to] chose [, I] guess _I would_ [, [I] am] [sure] _I would_ take [the] lethal injection . 
B|53| M: Does [it] [have to go] [to] trial ?

B|55| M: Is [this] [one of the] better ones ? 
A|56| B: _It's a_ [, _it's] a_ tough _question_ . [It] really [is] [. I] guess , [if] [I] had _to say_ _yes_ [or] no [, _I] would_ _say_ [, [you] [know] _,] yes_ [. I] [, _I] would_ [have to] lean toward [capital] punishment [, [you] [know] ,] for certain crimes . 
B|57| M: Is [it] ? 
A|58| B: [No [,] I don't _think] _it's_ a_ monetary [thing .] 
B|59| M: Do [you] [think] _we_ should [have] [a] prison [system] ?

B|61| M: How [do] [you know] ? 
A|62| B: Some [of the] crimes [are] just [so] brutal _and_ [so] [, [you] [know] ,] useless . This may seem [to] _be the_ best way out [. I [don't] know] . 
B|63| M: [Yeah [.] It's a] [crime [,] but] [it's] [not] [a] [crime] [in the] sense [that it's] illegal . 
A|64| B: Easiest way out _maybe ._ [No [,] I don't _think] _it's_ a_ monetary [thing .] 
B|65| M: The worst [thing] [is] [that it's] [not] [a] legal [thing .] 
A|66| B: _Yes ,_ especially [the] murder rate , its just gone crazy . _Yes_ . 
B|67| M: _So_ what's [the] deal [with] Dallas ? 
A|68| B: Absolutely . _Yes [,_ I] wish [I] had [the] answer for [that] , everybody does . 
B|69| M: Do [you know] [what] [the] [number of] murders per capita [in] [Texas] [is] ? 
A|70| B: _Yes [,_ it's] nothing [to] _be_ proud [of] , certainly [not .] 
B|71| M: [Yes [,] you] [are] . 
A|72| B: [Yes] . [Yes [,] so] _have we_ been _very_ , _very_ fortunate . 
B|73| M: _So_ [have we] 
A|74| B: _That's right ._ Absolutely . 
B|75| M: _Well [,_ we] [are] [a] [very] small country . 
A|76| B: Uh-huh . 
B|77| M: _So_ [what] [are] [you] trying [to say] ? 
A|78| B: Absolutely . 
B|79| M: _Well ,_ [they do] [it] all [the] time . 
A|80| B: Uh-huh . _That's right ._ 
B|81| M: [That's right .] 
A|82| B: Uh-huh .

A|84| B: [So] _would_ [I] [, I] fortunately [, _I] have_ never been [in] [that] circumstance _, I hope_ [I] never [am] , like , like everybody else . 
B|85| M: [If you] [were] [in the] jury , I'm [sure] [you] [would be] able [to] tell [the] judge [what] [the] judge said . 
A|86| B: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: Heh [, uh] [. [I] think I] [know] [you ,] I'm uhhh ... [I think] you're [a] guy , huh ?

A|92| B: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [I] mean , I'm [not] [a] lawyer [but] [I] can tell [you] [this] . 
A|94| B: Sure [, it's [,] [it's] a] big responsibility , [it] really [is] . 
B|95| M: [I] mean [, you] can't [be the] judge [of the] jury . 
A|96| B: [Yes] . [So] [would] [I] . 
B|97| M: [I would] . 
A|98| B: [Yes] . Absolutely . 
B|99| M: Would [you] [be] okay [with] [this] ? 
A|100| B: [It] [is] [, [it's] a] tough subject , [it] really [is] . 
B|101| M: [I [think] it's] [the] [most] important [question] [I have] . 
A|102| B: Right . [That's right .]
