B|1| M: Oh , _and_ [I] ? 
A|2| B: Okay _Uh_ , I've , _the_ high _school_ [I] went to was , uh , was a good one also . _And_ [I] , well _, I_ guess _you_ could _say_ one of _the_ problems with _the_ public education system is _the_ disparity between different schools . Because _the_ one [I] went to was _, you know_ , _I'm_ _sure_ a , a lot nicer than _, you know_ , a lot of _the_ inner city schools [and] _the_ things around Atlanta . 
B|3| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|4| B: [Yeah .] 
B|5| M: _You_ _are_ [you] not _in the_ _school [,_ you know] ? 
A|6| B: _What_ 
B|7| M: Well 
A|8| B: [Yeah] , _that's_ true . 
B|9| M: [And] 
A|10| B: [Yeah .] [And] _I'm_ also _I mean ,_ [in the] , [in] those places where , uh , _like_ [the] economy is _really_ bad _, they_ might [, you know] , _be_ more tempted to , to quit [school] [and] get jobs [and] that kind of thing because _they_ need [the] [, you know] , money to put food on [the] table [and] stuff _like_ that . More than _they_ _would_ [you know] , [in] areas where _they_ 
B|11| M: _I think_ [that's] _it_ . 
A|12| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] That's true . 
B|13| M: Your words 
A|14| B: Right . 
B|15| M: [I] don't 
A|16| B: [Yeah .] 
B|17| M: [What] ? 
A|18| B: That's hard for me to _say_ since [I] didn't _, I_ didn't _really_ grow , well when [I] went to elementary [school] [it] _, it_ wasn't [in] a great area _but_ [I] still _, _I_ mean , I_ learned to read , started learning to read when [I] was [in] kindergarten [, you know] . 
B|19| M: _No [,_ it] . 
A|20| B: So [I] guess [I] can't _really_ [I] can't _say what_ [it] _would be_ _like_ to , uh , grow _up in_ a _really_ oppressed region 
B|21| M: It's not [like] [you] can [say what] [you] [would be] if [you] grew [up [in] the] country . 
A|22| B: [You] [know] _, I_ guess [the] whole , [the] whole environment [and] attitude towards [school] [and] learning is different for [the] people . 
B|23| M: [I mean , I] [know] I'd [be] 
A|24| B: So [, I] guess [the] problem is [the] , [the] thing to do is to try to , uh , to get some kind of motivation to learn [and] , 
B|25| M: [I'm] not [sure] [, _I] think_ 
A|26| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] Uh-huh . 
B|27| M: [I] . 
A|28| B: [No [,] I] [, I] can't [say] that [I] have either . But , uh , 
B|29| M: [I] don't , [but] 
A|30| B: [Yeah .] I've , I've heard some [, [I] mean] I've heard statistics [and] things that , that _compare_ a public education to a private education . [I mean] within [like] , within [the] same , uh , income groups . 
B|31| M: Nope .. [Uh] . 
A|32| B: If [you] _compare_ [the] , [like] [the] people that could have , that could have sent their kids to private schools [and] [the] people that [, you know] , [the] people that , uh , did send their kids to private schools . 
B|33| M: Private [school] . 
A|34| B: [I think] _they_ _compare [you_ know] , fairly well . 
B|35| M: Not _really [,_ they] don't [compare you] [in] any way . 
A|36| B: [Yeah .] [I] [, I] [, I] , my schools [, [I] mean ,] there [, I] have a lot of once , once [it] seemed [I] got into high [school [,] they] had a lot of , uh , accelerated programs [and] all kinds of stuff [like] that . 
B|37| M: Ya ' 
A|38| B: That [, [I] mean ,] that makes a big difference cause [I] wondered when they're taking classes with , uh , with people that [are] [really ,] [are] interested [in the] , [the] subject [and] stuff [like] that .
