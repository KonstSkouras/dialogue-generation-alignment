A|0| B: Uh-huh . 
B|1| M: _I think_ _you're_ confusing _the sentence_ _with_ _the sentence_ . 
A|2| B: _Yeah_ . Uh-huh , well from _what_ [I] [I] saw _a_ statistic just _a_ few days ago , um , so far this year , or _was_ _it_ during [the] last year , during _a_ year's time , _I think it_ _was_ _they_ executed twenty-five people _in_ [the] nation . Meanwhile , there were twenty-five hundred people on death row . _So_ [I] , [I] _, and it's_ building up , _you_ _know ,_ they're , they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so _it's_ really building up . 
B|3| M: N 
A|4| B: Uh-huh . 
B|5| M: _no_ 
A|6| B: _Yeah ,_ everybody's _got_ that . 
B|7| M: [So] . 
A|8| B: Uh-huh . _Yeah_ . Uh-huh . 
B|9| M: No _, but_ _you can_ . 
A|10| B: _Yeah_ . Isn't , isn't _Maryland_ where [the] famous Willy Horton case _was_ . 
B|11| M: _Well_ ? 
A|12| B: It _was , uh ,_ that _was_ [the] one that _was_ used so much _in_ [the] campaign . In [the] _in_ [the] presidential race . Uh , may , _it_ may _not_ _have_ been _Maryland_ . It may _have_ been Massachusetts , [I] don't remember . 
B|13| M: [Maryland] 
A|14| B: Anyway , well [the] question _is_ , [you] _know ,_ do [you] [think] , _it does_ make _a_ difference _in_ whether or _not_ _a_ criminal commits _a_ crime or do [you] _think it_ [can] if _it's_ done right ? 
B|15| M: I'ma 
A|16| B: If _it_ , 
B|17| M: [I think [it] does] . 
A|18| B: Uh-huh 
B|19| M: [Yeah _,] what_ ? 
A|20| B: [Yeah] . [Well] [I think] _in_ large measure [the] reason _they_ don't care , _it's_ _not_ because [the] punishment [, but] so many _of_ [the] people that commit crimes don't get punished . 
B|21| M: Because [the] justice system [is] flawed . 
A|22| B: _The_ _police_ don't catch them , or [the] courts don't convict them , or , or _they_ don't serve very much _of_ [the] time _and_ so _, uh ,_ [you] _know ,_ _their_ , _their_ success rate [is] very high . Crime [does] pay , [you can] make _a_ good living at _it ._ 
B|23| M: _I'm not sure_ . 
A|24| B: [Yeah] . 
B|25| M: A 
A|26| B: Last year [it] _was_ D C , [I] guess Baltimore caught them . 
B|27| M: You [got] lucky 
A|28| B: Uh-huh 
B|29| M: _I'm_ sorry [but] _, we_ _have to_ keep [it] alive [and] alive [and] [not] die . 
A|30| B: [Yeah] . 
B|31| M: _So [,_ uh ,] what's _the next_ step ? 
A|32| B: [Yeah _,] the_ only consolation [is] so many _of_ [the] murders are , [you] _know _, the_ , the_ violent people going against each other [and] so _they_ , [you] _know ,_ society's [not] going [to] put them [to] death , well at least maybe _the guy_ _they_ cross [next] time [is] going [to] . Uh , [I think] , [I think] capital punishment [is] an appropriate punishment for [the] kind _of_ people where [we] say , [you] _know ,_ this sort _of_ person [is] just [not] acceptable [to] our society [and] [we] are there by going [to] remove them from society _, not_ temporarily [, but] permanently . 
B|33| M:  
A|34| B: [I] mean , [I] , [I] personally [think] life imprisonment , [I] don't [think] much _of_ _of_ life imprisonment . First _of_ all , _it's_ never , turns _out_ [to] be life [, but] second , [you] _know ,_ why should [we] _, the_ idea _of_ life imprisonment [with] [no] chance _of_ parole . [Well] that means [you're] going [to] put them _in_ _a_ cage [you] [think] _it's_ never ever going [to] be safe for them [to] walk [the] streets again , well then , why bother . Just execute them , because that's , that way [you're] [sure] they'll never ever going [to] walk [the] streets again . 
B|35| M:  
A|36| B: [So] any , any , anybody that says life _in_ prison [with] [no] chance _of_ parole , I'd say [, uh ,] give them [the] death _penalty_ [So ,] 
B|37| M: You 
A|38| B: [Yeah _,] and_ _, and_ also , um _, the , the_ thing [I] don't like about _a_ lot _of_ these court trials [and] _a_ lot _of_ these appeals [is] that _it's_ [not] based on [what] [is] true [and] [what] [is] false [but] rather _it's_ on [the] rules _of_ evidence [, what] [can] [I] hide [and] [what] do [I] [have to] tell . 
B|39| M:  
A|40| B: And [I think] our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding _out_ [the] truth than _they_ currently are . 
B|41| M: [I] can't . 
A|42| B: And _, and_ that way [we] [can] be [sure] , [you] _know [,_ we] [can] find _out_ [the] truth [, we] [can] find _out_ [what] really happened [and] _, and_ base [the sentence] on [what] [the] person _did_ _, not_ on [what] we're allowed [to] let _the jury_ hear 
B|43| M:  
A|44| B: Uh-huh 
B|45| M: [I think] he's [in] jail 
A|46| B: Uh-huh . 
B|47| M: [I think] he [was , uh [,] uh] . 
A|48| B: Just started shooting people , because _they_ botched [the] first _job_ 
B|49| M:  
A|50| B: [and] , so now they're going [to] get even . 
B|51| M: You're [, and it's] 
A|52| B: [Yeah] . 
B|53| M: That's [a] bit weird 
A|54| B: Uh-huh . 
B|55| M: u [know ,] stupid guys . 
A|56| B: [Yeah] . 
B|57| M: It's [the] [police] officer .

A|60| B: Oh . 
B|61| M: [Well] , he [was] accused [of] [it .] 
A|62| B: Uh-huh . 
B|63| M: Yea _. I_ [know] . 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: Uhhhhh ... huh ? 
A|66| B: _The _, the_ penalty_ phase , yeah , they've , decide _the penalty_ separately from [the] verdict . 
B|67| M: [The [, the] [, the] penalty] 
A|68| B: Uh-huh . 
B|69| M: It's [uh [,] _not] ._ 
A|70| B: [Yeah ,] well , [you] [know ,] [you] just [have to] decide , [you] [know ,] well there's really two separate decisions there [I] guess , one [is] , [did] [it] really happen [the] way [the , the] prosecutor said [it] happened , [you] [know ,] [is] this man really guilty [, and] [you] [have to] decide that [, but] then [you] [have to] decide , [you] [know ,] as [a] member [of] society [what] do [I] want [to] do [with] this [guy] who [did] this thing . 
B|71| M: h 
A|72| B: And that [I] , I've never been on [a jury] , I've never had that experience , [I'm not sure] I'd look forward [to] making that kind [of] decision about [a] man's life . 
B|73| M: [I] 
A|74| B: Uh-huh 
B|75| M: You're . 
A|76| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . [Well] [the] thing I'd be most likely [to] attach [the] death [penalty] [to] [is] [the] violence [. I] mean , [I] [can] handle people , people selling drugs , [you] [know ,] [it's] , [it's] wrong [, but] [it] , [it's] [not] worth somebody getting executed for . But [we] hear so much about [the] violence [and] how [it's] [not] safe [to] walk [the] streets because somebody , [you] [know ,] these random drive by shootings [and] that sort [of] thing . 
B|77| M:  
A|78| B: And [the] people I'd most likely want [to] [sentence] [to] death are [the] people that just show [a] really low regard for human life . That , [you] [know ,] [you] , never [know] when they're going [to] turn or hurt [the next] person because [it] doesn't really matter [to] them whether someone else gets hurt or [not .] 
B|79| M:  ... 
A|80| B: And so [I] go , these are [the] kind [of] people [I] would like [to] get [out] [of] here [and] get [out] [of] circulation [and] say [I] don't [, we] don't accept your kind [in] our society .
