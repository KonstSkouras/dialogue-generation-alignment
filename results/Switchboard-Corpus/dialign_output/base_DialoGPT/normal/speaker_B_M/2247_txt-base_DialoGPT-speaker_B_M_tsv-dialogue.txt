B|27| M: Um ... um ... [what] ? 
A|28| B: Have [you] _been_ [, uh ,] _struggling along_ those lines ? 
B|29| M: Yeah . _I've been_ [struggling along] [that] line lately . 
A|30| B: [Well _,] I_ think [you] will be real pleased [to] [get] away from [the] banana as [I] used [to] call [it .] It's [, uh _,] I_ used [it] on [, uh ,] some other machines [in] days gone by _and_ [was] real pleased [to] leave [it .] It [was a] real memory hog when [you] started making large blot changes [to] [it .] 
B|31| M:  ...

B|33| M:

B|35| M: This . 
A|36| B: [Well ,] [it's] _just a_ huge file [that] tries [to] describe [the] requirements [of] [what you're] trying [to] build . Uh , [to] one level down from assistant description . 
B|37| M: [I'm] . 
A|38| B: [Well _,] I_ [sure] need them . Uh , there's no _way_ [that] [I] could begin [to] process _and_ keep up [with] [the] kinds [of] information or [the] magnitude [of] information [that] [I] need [to] , [to] try [to] [do] my job without them . 
B|39| M:  
A|40| B: Yes [, uh ,] maybe you'll play around some _and_ figure _out_ [how] they can help [you] [do] [different] things . [I] think [that's] when [you] _, you_ start deciding [that] [you] [really] need greater assets than [you] already [have] . When [you] start seeing [what] all they can [do] [for] [you] . 
B|41| M: [what] 
A|42| B: [Well _,] I_ understand [that] [you] [know] . if , needs _and_ wants were [the same] I'd [have] [a] four eighty-six [machine] at home 
B|43| M: [You] . 
A|44| B: Right . 
B|45| M: [I was] thinking _of the_ future . 
A|46| B: Uh , [that's] , came _out_ around [the] first [of the] year . 
B|47| M: [I'm] pretty [sure] [the] original [was] released [in] 2003 [, and] [the] original [version] [was] released [just _a] few_ months after . 
A|48| B: It does [a few] more things [, uh ,] than had [been] available before . 
B|49| M: Yeah [, but] [it's] [been] [out] [for] [a] while now . 
A|50| B: But [I'm not sure] [that it's] such [a] massive improvement . Uh _, you_ [know] , once [you get] passed thirty-three megahertz , all help [is] , kind [of] lost [in the] [, [in] the] translation . Because [you] no longer can think [that] fast anyway . 
B|51| M: I'ma 
A|52| B: [Well ,] okay . [I] enjoyed our discussion . 
B|53| M: You're right [, I was] [just] thinking [of it] [in] [a] [different] [way] . 
A|54| B: [You] [do] [the same] .
