B|5| M: No _. They_ _can_ [be] _put_ _in jail [,_ but] _if they're_ convicted _, they_ _are_ _not_ _sentenced_ . 
A|6| B: Because _if they_ turn around [, they] [can] _get away [,_ _they] get away_ with _it_ _, and_ _they get away_ with _it_ _, and_ _they get away_ with _it_ _, and_ _then _they_ do_ something worse 
B|7| M: Why [do] [they do] _this_ ?

A|22| B: [that's] _what ,_ [that's] _what_ people face with [that] choice .

B|23| M: I'm _not_ crying 
A|24| B: [that] should [be] life [, but] , instead , [in] , [in] given _the_ choice _of_ either sentencing _to death_ , or sentencing _to_ life , they'll give them ninety years [in prison] or something [, and] _then_ turn around [in] thirty years [, that _,] _you_ know_ [, and] less [they're] out . 
B|25| M: _and _,_ [to_ , you] _, [to_ be] . 
A|26| B: Even [if] , [if they're] even [in] [that] long . Or [they] _appeal_ [, and] _then _they_ get_ an _appeal_ [that] says _it_ _was_ [, _you] know_ , an unjust amount _of_ _time_ , an extraordinary long length , or something . 
B|27| M: [They] 
A|28| B: Yeah . I'd like [to] see _the death_ penalty more as [a] deterrent _, I think_ people _know_ [that] nobody [, that] _it_ doesn't [, _you] know_ _, it's_ [not] [a] deterrent right now , because _it's_ [not] really effective . 
B|29| M: _You_ 
A|30| B: There's should [be] [, _you] know_ , [this] , for [this] crime , [this] _is the_ penalty . [You] killed , someone _you know_ , [in] cold blood or whatever . 
B|31| M: No , [of] , [of] [you] , 
A|32| B: _This_ _is_ what's going [to] happen . 
B|33| M: I'm [not] sure . 
A|34| B: [And _,] I_ mean , _it_ sounds horrible . It _, I_ hear myself _saying_ [this] [, and [,] but] _, I_ , _don't _know_ what_ else _to do_ with some [of] these people [, that] [are] , 
B|35| M: [I] ,,, [I think] ,, [you] ,, [got] [it] . 
A|36| B: because [they] let them back out again [, and] [they do] _the_ same _thing_ over [, and] over , again , 
B|37| M: Why [is] [there] no reason [to do] [that] ? 
A|38| B: _then they_ [put] them back [in jail [,] and] _they get_ out [, and] [and] more [and] more innocent people [are] hurt or killed 
B|39| M: If [they] _were_ , [then they] [are] . 
A|40| B: [and] these guys _just_ [are] _on the_ endless merry-go-round _in the_ legal system . 
B|41| M: [They] _were_ . They're _still_ [on [the] death] row list . 
A|42| B: [And] _it's_ like [I] _said_ at our expense . 
B|43| M: _yeah_ [, they] _are [in_ jail] . 
A|44| B: Yes . 
B|45| M: Do [you] [think] [that] [the] US [is the] only country [that] does [that] ? 
A|46| B: _I know_ _, I_ [, you] read about [it] _in the_ paper , every day , somebody who's done [this] , or [that ,] something really horrible 
B|47| M: Oh , no _, it's a_ big story . It's [not] news . 
A|48| B: [and] [they] _just_ _get away_ with [it] [, and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: [They [get] away _,] but [they_ get away] . 
A|50| B: Yeah _. [I_ think] [I think] Texas [is] Texas , [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] [still] _have_ [the death] penalty [, and] [I think] _, _I_ know_ _California_ had [it] for [a] long _time_ [, and] [then they] , uh , took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: So ... 
A|52| B: [and] people like Charles Manson [, and , and] some [of] these other people , who [were] _sentenced to death_ at _the time_ [they] repealed [the death] penalty , [were] _sentenced to_ life [in prison , and] [are] now , now [that] even though _California_ has reinstated [the death] penalty , for whatever various crimes . The people who [were] [there] originally , when [they] , when [they] changed [the] laws [to] revoke [the death] penalty , [are] [still] [in] [there] for , [are [in] prison ,] [in] quote , for life [, and , and] [are] now coming up for parole , some [of] them , like Manson who's come up _you know_ 
B|53| M: [the] 
A|54| B: [it's] _been_ denied fortunately [but] , 
B|55| M: i 
A|56| B: Yeah . 
B|57| M: Did [you know] ?? 
A|58| B: Well , [the] jury [that] [sentenced] him , [sentenced] him _to death_ 
B|59| M: _You [know_ [what] [,] it's] [just] [a] joke . 
A|60| B: [and] [then] while _he was_ [on] _appeal_ [on] his thousandth [and] one _appeal_ , [the] state [of] _California_ revoked [the] _law _in_ the_ early seventies [, and] [then they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty didn't _go_ back . [You know] ? 
B|61| M: [I know] . I'm [just] [saying] [that] [he was] [sentenced to death] . 
A|62| B: It seems like [a] lot [of] times [the] _law_ [is] , [is] totally [on the] _criminal_ side [, and , and] isn't protecting [the] rest _of the_ people . 
B|63| M: I'm sorry [, but] _I don't_ understand [the] [appeal] process . 
A|64| B: Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: _I don't_ [think] [there] [is] [a] [criminal] [law in] [California] [, I think] 
A|66| B: Yeah . [And] [the] , [the] laws [are] _all_ , [the] rules . Some _of the_ things [that] _would_ make sense [to [,] to] _tell_ [the] jury [, that] [this] , [this] guy has [a] , [a] prior [criminal] history [, [you] know] , where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: [This] 
A|68| B: [and] [then] [he] gets up for [this] one trial [, and] [they] [don't] finds anything out about [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M: Hmmmm 
A|70| B: [and] so [they] say , well , [this] [is] [, [you] know] [, I] [, _I] don't know_ _if they_ say _it's the_ first _time_ offense or whatever [, but they] give him [a] lighter [sentence] , thinking he's [not] [a] habitual [criminal] . 
B|71| M: Ayeaay 
A|72| B: Yeah , [yeah] . Well , To some extent _if they_ _would_ [do] something with some [of] those people . But [that] seems [to be] [a good] way [to] [get] off for [a] lot [of] them too . 
B|73| M: [This] . 
A|74| B: [They] plead insanity 
B|75| M: [They] [said] they'd [do] [it] . 
A|76| B: [and] [then] three years later [they're] cured [, and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: What [if they] die ? 
A|78| B: [I] mean [, it's a] [it's a] scary _world_ out [there] anymore , where your _afraid_ _to go_ out , 
B|79| M: [They] [do] [it] [all] [the time] [. [I] don't] [think] [they're] [afraid] [of the] consequences . 
A|80| B: [I know] , [in] , _in the_ _Dallas_ metroplex area [, [I] don't] _go_ out hardly [if] [I don't] _have_ [to] at night by myself 
B|81| M: It's [a good] [thing] [you] [don't] live [in] [Dallas] _, I would_ [have] [been] terrified [to go] [to the] airport alone . 
A|82| B: [and] [I] [, I] certainly [, I] [, I] grew up [in] [a] smaller town [in] Texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way when _I was_ younger . 
B|83| M: No [, [it's] the] opposite . 
A|84| B: We could [go] around [, and ,] boy [and ,] 
B|85| M: I've [been] [to the] very top [of the] [world] [and] I'm [in the] very bottom [of the] earth . 
A|86| B: Yes . Ever [, you] can't even , when _I was_ [a] kid [, I would] run between my neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and ,] as long as my mom had [a] general [idea] where _I was_ [and] _I was_ back [on [the] time] , 
B|87| M: [That's] 
A|88| B: [and] now [I don't] let my kids out [of the] front yard [, that] [I] can't see them . 
B|89| M: [I was] sooooo 
A|90| B: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: I'm [not] sure [, but] [I] [can] [tell] [you] , I'm [not] [, you] 
A|92| B: Well , [good] talking [to] [you] too . Bye ,
