B|17| M: [It's] [not] [that] hard [to do] . 
A|18| B: Oh , [I] see . How'd , _how_ _did_ they , _how_ [do] they pick their _people_ ? 
B|19| M: _Because_ [it's] [a] [random .] org poll . 
A|20| B: Uh-huh . 
B|21| M: What _does_ [a] college 
A|22| B: Oh , [I] see . So , _do you_ ... 
B|23| M: [I think] [you] [are] thinking [of] [the] NCAA _, the_ one [that] [is] responsible [for] [the] NCAA's [drug] 
A|24| B: _Right ._ _Well ,_ _do _you_ think_ [that] _should be_ implemented _in the_ work place . _You_ _know_ , as like [a] manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion [that] someone [is] using _drugs_ , _do _you_ think_ they _should_ _have_ [the] _right_ _to send_ _them_ [to] _be tested ._ 
B|25| M:  
A|26| B: _Right ._ 
B|27| M: [I think] [it] [should be] possible [to send] [people] who use [drugs] [to] test [them] 
A|28| B: _Right ._ 
B|29| M: [Right .] 
A|30| B: [Right] , _right _._ [Yeah_ ,] [it] , [it] _would_ almost [be] like [a] , [a] [, _uh] ..._ 
B|31| M: They [would] [be] mad [at] [you] [if you] [did] . 
A|32| B: Uh-huh . And then _how_ _would you_ feel afterwards when [you] came _up_ negative _and_ _, you_ _know_ , your supervisor has accused [you] [of] using [drugs] . 
B|33| M: How [would you] react 
A|34| B: [Right .] [I] agree with [that] . [Because] [I] _know_ personally myself , _I've_ been _in the_ same _job_ [for] three years , [it] will [be] three years _in_ August _and_ _I've_ already been [drug] _tested_ three times . 
B|35| M: [I] 
A|36| B: _Well ,_ _I'm_ an environmental engineer 
B|37| M: What ? 
A|38| B: _and_ _I've_ been [drug] _tested_ three times _and_ [I] _know_ many [people] [that] _have_ _never_ been _tested_ _in_ their lifetime _and_ [the] _company_ [I] work [for] [is] sixty thousand [people] , plus . So see [I] , [for] some reason , _I've_ come _up_ three times . That's pretty high statistics . 
B|39| M: High ? _No ._ 
A|40| B: [No .] [No] , [not] [at] all . 
B|41| M: Do [you think] [that's] [how] [it] works ? 
A|42| B: [It's] [a] legal _job_ _, you_ _know_ 
B|43| M: [I'm] [not] sure [what] [I'm] [doing] . 
A|44| B: so , see [it's] really strange . 
B|45| M: [I don't [know] .] 
A|46| B: Oh , uh-huh . 
B|47| M: [It's] weird . [I've] [never] seen [a] doctor [in the] world [of] medicine , but [I've] seen doctors [and] nurses . 
A|48| B: [Right .] _Well ,_ [does] your [, the] _company_ say , [for] instance , [does] [the] _company_ [you] worked [for] before _have_ [the] _right_ or [do] they _have_ [the] ability [to] say , hey , we've already [drug] _tested_ her [and] she came _up_ negative . 
B|49| M: This ? 
A|50| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|51| M: Drug test 
A|52| B: [Right] , _right ._ 
B|53| M: You're [right .] They can't force [another] [drug] [company] [to] [drug] test _you ._ 
A|54| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|55| M: [I don't] remember [this] . 
A|56| B: Uh-huh _. Yeah ._ And [are] they _tested_ [random] ? 
B|57| M: [I] mean [, you] can [be tested .] 
A|58| B: They're ... 
B|59| M: Uuhhh uhuh . Uhuhuhuh 
A|60| B: Oh , okay . [I] see .

A|64| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|65| M: What [are] [you] talking about ? 
A|66| B: Oh , [I] see . 
B|67| M: [Because] [the] [drug] test [is] [in the] USA [, and] there [is] no [drug] [testing] [for] [a drug] test [in the] UK . 
A|68| B: Uh-huh . Okay , so they [know] [that] . And [that's] ... 
B|69| M: You're on [the] way [to] [the] [drug] test . 
A|70| B: Uh-huh . Okay . _Well_ ... 
B|71| M: [Well ,] we [know] what's [up] . 
A|72| B: [Yeah] 
B|73| M: [You] ... [uh ...] [you] [don't know] ? 
A|74| B: [I think] so _. [Yeah_ ,] seven twenty-five .
