A|49| A: Wow . 
B|50| M: We [do] _have_ [the] _most_ . 
A|51| A: Um . 
B|52| M: [The] _only_ thing [that's] [been] [a] problem _for_ me [is] [the] number _, so _I_ think_ [it's a] good deal . 
A|53| A: Um _yeah_ . [Yeah .] 
B|54| M: Are [you] saying [that] [the] current build 
A|55| A: [Well ,] right now _we're_ [just] renting [, but] [it] [is] _a home_ . Um , 
B|56| M:  
A|57| A: [it's a] four bedroom [home] It has _about_ _, I_ guess , eighteen hundred square feet [It's] _on_ [one] floor 
B|58| M:  ... [what] ? 
A|59| A: Uh [, we] _have no_ _basement_ [I don't know] , 
B|60| M: Uhh [, uh [,] uh] . [we're] [not] _in_ [a] [basement] 
A|61| A: Okay [I] wasn't [sure .] Most [of the] ones , [you] [know] , up north _and_ everything [do] [, but _,] um_ , anyway [, it's] [, uh [,] it's] pretty , also pretty typical [for] [the] area . Most [of] [this] area [was] developed , [this] [house] [was] built [in] seventy-four . 
B|62| M: [I don't] [, [I] don't] [, _I] [have_ no] idea . 
A|63| A: [So] [most] [of the] [, it's] almost twenty years [old] _, and_ [most] [of the] houses [around] here were built pretty much _the same_ style Uh [, we] [have a] friend [that] lives two blocks over _, and_ his _house is_ almost identical [to] us , except his [is] three bedrooms _and_ ours [is] four 
B|64| M: _Yeah [,_ um] 
A|65| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty much _the same_ . [So] [I] [, [I] think] [most] [of] [them] _are_ there [was] [, it] , [like] [most] areas [that] _are_ built [, um] , there were probably , [like] two or three styles [you] could choose from 
B|66| M:  ... 
A|67| A: And _, and_ [, uh ,] [that's] pretty much all [the] houses [in the] area , [for] probably [a] square mile , [I'd say] , at least , maybe even [a] little [bit] more than [that .] 
B|68| M: [yeah] , 
A|69| A: Where _are you_ [in] relation [to] _Sevren_ ? _are you_ close [to] _Sevren_ ? 
B|70| M: [I] ,, 
A|71| A: Okay .

A|75| A: [I [have] a] sister [that] used [to] [live in] [Sevren] . 
B|76| M: What _is that ?_ 
A|77| A: And they bought their [home] [in] [I] [, I] want [to] [say] [like] [around] nineteen seventy-five or _something_ [like that] _, and_ they paid [like] , they , they had [it] built from , [you] [know] , they , they designed [it] _and_ everything _, and_ [to] [have] [it] built they [only] paid forty thousand [for] [it] _, and_ when they left [the] area they sold [it] [for] [a] hundred _and_ twenty thousand 
B|78| M: [I] can't [say] I've ever heard _of [a_ home] builder . 
A|79| A: [Yeah [,] so _I] just_ wondered , [you] [know] , [if] [the] whole area [was] [like that] or , 
B|80| M: I'm [sure] 
A|81| A: Uh-huh . 
B|82| M: _Why_ ? 
A|83| A: Um . 
B|84| M: [I think] 
A|85| A: [Yeah .] 
B|86| M:  ... [I] ... [I just] saw [the] second [one] ... 
A|87| A: Sounds [like] _a lot_ [of] money though 
B|88| M: I've got [a lot] . 
A|89| A: [sure .] [Yeah .] 
B|90| M: Can [you] imagine spending [that] [many] [on] [something] [that's not] [a] game ? 
A|91| A: Right . _Oh ,_ [yeah] . 
B|92| M: [Well [,] it's] [only] [the] [most] expensive [one] . 
A|93| A: Wow . [Yeah .] 
B|94| M:  
A|95| A: Wow Wow , [that's] , 
B|96| M: [I have] [you] pay [a] million dollars . 
A|97| A: Really ? That much [of a] difference ? 
B|98| M: [The] [house is] [in] my town [, and] [I] [live [in] the] town [of [the] same] name . 
A|99| A: Wow . 
B|100| M: [Oh ,] absolutely . 
A|101| A: [Yeah] 
B|102| M: That's [really] [, really] sad . 
A|103| A: Wow . [Why] [is that ?] [Do you] [know] ? [I] mean 
B|104| M: [It's] sad 
A|105| A: Uh-huh 
B|106| M: [So [,] what] [are you] saying ? 
A|107| A: [Oh .] 
B|108| M: [Yeah .] [It's] [the] reason why [I] [live in] Florida . 
A|109| A: [Oh] 
B|110| M: [I'd] [like] [to] see [a] picture [of a] [real] job 
A|111| A: My goodness 
B|112| M: I'm [a] private school teacher . 
A|113| A: Wow
