B|24| M: [I'm Brian .] 
A|25| A: Just [a] moment Okay Nancy , _then I_ guess [the] , today's subject [is] benefits [in the] job other than salary . 
B|26| M: [I'm Brian .] 
A|27| A: [What] _, uh_ what _do you_ feel are important [to] _you_ _or_ other [people] as , as crucial benefits ? 
B|28| M: [I'm] _not_ [a] scientist . 
A|29| A: Uh-huh . 
B|30| M: Um ... [What] ? 
A|31| A: Oh 
B|32| M: Uh _, you know _,_ _I don't_ have_ any special qualifications . 
A|33| A: Uh-huh . Right . Uh-huh . 
B|34| M: Um hmm 
A|35| A: To , [to] compensate _for_ some [of the] benefits . 
B|36| M: Why [do you] hate free ? 
A|37| A: Oh . 
B|38| M: [I'm] [a] doctor . 
A|39| A: [Yes .] 
B|40| M: Wait . You _don't_ need _insurance_ [for] [a] month ? 
A|41| A: _Well ,_ _that_ , _that's_ an excellent , so actually _that_ [is] _a benefit_ _, uh ,_ 
B|42| M: No _, _I_ mean_ _like_ [I] _get_ [to] _work_ 7 _days a week_ _, and_ [then I] can't _work_ 7 . 5 _days a_ month . 
A|43| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|44| M: _I think_ it's [a benefit] [of] being a'long time'employee . 
A|45| A: Right . Right , well [I] guess _that's_ [a] [good] point _, uh ,_ 
B|46| M: [I'm] [just] _not_ _really_ interested [in] any [of] [that] . 
A|47| A: [I] [do] belong [to] _a ,_ [a] large corporation _or_ [my] , [that] where [I'm] currently employed [and] there's _, uh ,_ there's some different things _, uh ,_ one [that] you've already mentioned [is] , [is] health _insurance ._ [I think] through our health [insurance] [that] [I] can [get] better rates as _a ,_ through _a group_ plan as opposed [to] going out [and] getting health [insurance] on an individual basis because [I] had [to] [do] [that] at one time when [I] wasn't employed with [a] large corporation 
B|48| M: [I] 
A|49| A: [and] [that] got _to be_ somewhat expensive , so [I] [I think] one [of the] benefits [I] [, I] see [is] [the] _, uh ,_ [is] [the] _group_ _, uh ,_ _group_ discount . 
B|50| M: It's [a] business . 
A|51| A: [Yes .] 
B|52| M: Yup . 
A|53| A: [Yes [,] and] _that's_ , _that's_ one thing [I] [do] [have] . 
B|54| M: But [you] [have] [the] option [to be] _in _a_ family_ [or] [a group] . 
A|55| A: If [I] didn't [have [a] family] [, I don't] [think] [I] would [have] , as , as [a] male [or] as _a ,_ as an individual [of] , [in] this stage [of] [my] life [, I don't] [think] [I] would _have insurance_ _, uh ,_ other , 
B|56| M: _I mean_ [, you] _don't have_ [to be] rich [to] [have [insurance] .] 
A|57| A: [I don't] [think] [I] would go through [that] expense . One other [benefit] [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [, I] [really] enjoyed because they had what [was] called flex schedule where [I] could go _and I_ could [work] _, uh ,_ nine hour [days] [and] [have] [like] Friday only [work] four hours 
B|58| M: [I] 
A|59| A: [or] [I] could [do] _, uh ,_ [work] four [days a week] at ten hours [a] day [and] _have a [,_ you know ,] three day weekend . And make _, uh ,_ make [my] job flexible [in] [that] case . 
B|60| M: Work , [I'm] [, uh _,] yeah [,_ yeah] 
A|61| A: _Well ,_ basically [, yeah] [I] had [to] [do] , [that] [, uh ,] [the] same [, uh ,] [for] [about] every quarter [of the] year . [I mean] [uh ,] because [I was] [in _a] ,_ [in a] position [of] management [I] had responsibilities over [people] [that] _, uh , I_ needed [to] make [my] schedule [, uh ,] so [that] if [I was] [not] there [I] would [have] coverage by some other management personnel , 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: so , so [I] _, I think_ [that] [, uh ,] [that] [was] _a ,_ [that] [was] an excellent [benefit] [that] [I] [really] enjoyed 
B|64| M: You , 
A|65| A: _and [I_ don't have] [that] [in] [my] current operation , but [, uh [,] you] mentioned [, uh ,] flexible [work] schedule [and] _that's_ , _that's_ [good .] 
B|66| M: I'd [have _a ,] uh [,_ uh] . 
A|67| A: And [, uh ,] what other benefits [do you] [think] are important ? 
B|68| M: [Yeah [,] uh [, I] don't] [, uh , I] don t [, I think] [, uh] ... 
A|69| A: [Yeah [,] yeah ,] _that's_ true . 
B|70| M: You said [, uh ,] _retirement_ [, [and] I] said , uhh [, you] said ... 
A|71| A: _Well [,_ and] _that's_ an individual thing . 
B|72| M: [Well ,] [I'm] sure [that's] why [I'm] still [in] school . 
A|73| A: [Yeah ,] with [, uh ,] with our current [, uh ,] organization , we [do] [have a] nice [retirement] package [and] also [a ,] [a] nice thing [that] , [that] we [have] [in] our corporation [is] [a , uh ,] [is] [a] profit sharing plan where we can [, uh ,] participate [in the] , [the] profits [of the] company . If [we're] [, you know ,] if we've been there [a] while [and] [we're] vested [, uh ,] which means [that] [, you know ,] we [have a ,] an interest [, uh ,] [in the] company [that] we can [, uh ,] [get] some [of the] benefits [of the] , either [the] profit high times [or] , [or] [in a] sense , suffer during [the] low times 
B|74| M: i 
A|75| A: [and] [, uh ,] also [, uh ,] [in] one [of] [my] wife's [, uh ,] companies where she worked , they'd had [a] real nice profit sharing plan [that] , [that] ,
