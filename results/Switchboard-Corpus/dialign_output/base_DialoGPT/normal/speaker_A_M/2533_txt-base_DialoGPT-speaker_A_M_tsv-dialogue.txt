B|20| M: _No_ [it] _doesn't_ .

B|36| M: _It's_ [not like] [they] _play_ each _other_ every _year ._ 
A|37| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|38| M: So [the] Yankees _are the_ New England Patriots ? 
A|39| A: The Texas Rangers , [they] , [they] lost _, I think_ . 
B|40| M: Who's [the team] ? 
A|41| A: But _I know_ that _last_ [year] _we_ [did] go _to_ [a] baseball game _last_ [year .] We got free tickets because someone at our church , one [of the] deacons at church , um , parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek which _is_ [like] one [of _the] , uh ,_ [the] places _and_ stuff . 
B|42| M: _You_ _are_ [right] _, but_ _they [have_ been] [in the] past . 
A|43| A: _And_ he's their head chauffeur , _is_ _this_ funny , as they're parking [the] cars [the] valet service . 
B|44| M: He's [the] driver [of [the] _car] ._ 
A|45| A: _Yeah ,_ he makes good money too doing that , you'd be _I was_ shocked [, but] anyway , someone gave an Iranian [a] _tip_ [of] four Rangers tickets _last_ [year] , 
B|46| M: [I] 
A|47| A: _and_ then [the] Iranian couldn't , he didn't want them [, so] he gave them _to_ Alan , _and_ Alan _and_ his Dad had plans that night [so] [they] gave them _to_ us [, so] he decided that some wealthy man tipped _this_ Iranian , with baseball tickets , 
B|48| M: Ah [, I] [see] . 
A|49| A: _and_ _we_ ended up with them , [right .] _And_ [so] _we_ were , walking up 
B|50| M: There [was] [a] moment where [we] [all] agreed [to] [tip] each _other_ . 
A|51| A: _and_ [I] looked at _my_ husband _and_ [I] said , _you know_ _what_ Kyle _this_ _is_ The Mansion at Turtle Creek [a] [tip] [I] bet these [are] really good seats _and_ [so] [we] ended up _on_ first base [right] down there _on_ [the] floor , 
B|52| M: Weirdly _enough_ , 
A|53| A: oh , _yeah_ , [we] [they] called us at five _and_ [the] game started at seven [so] [we] just threw everything together , ran over _and_ got [the] tickets _and_ walked _and_ [so] [we] took two kids with us _and_ nobody brings two children [in] these seats , _you know_ because , 
B|54| M: [Yeah _,] it was_ . 
A|55| A: _yeah_ , _and_ [you] just sit down _and_ [all] [the] girls were [all] dressed up _you [know_ [,] I] just [was] there , _you [know_ ,] [like] [I'm] loaded [, I'm] here , _you [know_ ,] _and_ _, uh [,_ it was] just kind [of] funny because , _you [know_ [,] but] [we] got [to] sit by first base _if_ [they] [did] hit [a] ball [I] would [have been] afraid [it] would [have] knocked _my_ face [in] , _you _know_ ._ 
B|56| M:  ... 
A|57| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|58| M:  
A|59| A: Really ? 
B|60| M: i [, I [think] ,] 
A|61| A: [I'm] glad _my_ husband's [not like] that . 
B|62| M: Your wife [is] [on] [a] diet . 
A|63| A: Uh-huh . 
B|64| M: [Yeah ,] [my] mom _has_ [a] crush [on] _me_ 
A|65| A: Uh-huh . 
B|66| M: [I'm] [so] 
A|67| A: [That's] funny . 
B|68| M: _It's_ still , uhuhhuh ? 
A|69| A: [You] miss [the] whole thing . 
B|70| M: _What_ [do] [you] _mean ?_ 
A|71| A: [That's] funny . Where [is] he _from_ [in] _France_ ? Uh-huh . 
B|72| M:  
A|73| A: [Yeah] . [I] [have] [a] [, I] had [a] friend [in] college _from_ _Strasbourg ,_ 
B|74| M: [Yeah [,] but] [you're] [from] [France] . 
A|75| A: Uh-huh . _Paris_ . _And_ [my] cousin lives _in Paris_ _and she's_ _lived_ there for _like ,_ oh , off _and_ [on] for twenty years . 
B|76| M: [I don't know] _if [you_ know] [this] _but the_ [last] _time_ [I] [lived] [in Paris] [was] in'96 . 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . 
B|78| M: Hahaha [, [I] was] talking [about] [Strasbourg [,] but] [yeah] . 
A|79| A: _Saint Claude_ [is] that sound familiar ? 
B|80| M: _He_ [was] [a] [Saint Claude] 
A|81| A: [Yeah] . 
B|82| M: [Yeah ,] [Saint] . [Claude] 
A|83| A: _Oh ,_ really ? 
B|84| M: _It's_ [a] _nice_ place [to] _live_ . 
A|85| A: Uh-huh . 
B|86| M: _It's_ [the , uh ,] limit . 
A|87| A: [That's] neat . [Yeah ,] _she_ married _and_ [they have] twelve children . 
B|88| M:  ... [and she's] [like [, I] know .] 
A|89| A: _She_ [has] twelve children . 
B|90| M: _She looks_ _like a_ great mom . 
A|91| A: [She looks] gorgeous , no [she's] gorgeous [and] _she_ just liked having kids [and she's] _thin_ [and] [, I] [mean] , four or more children [are] _thin_ , 
B|92| M: Why [is] [she] [so] [thin] ? 
A|93| A: [I] [mean] [, [I'm] not] kidding [you] . 
B|94| M: _It's_ [a joke] . 
A|95| A: [No ,] your [, I] [have] [a] friend now that [has] seven . _And ,_ um , [and] they're [all] eight [and] under , [and] nine [and] under , 
B|96| M: [And [,] uh ,] [are] [you] [a] six [year] _old_ ? 
A|97| A: they're [all] real young , they're just raised [right] that's _what_ God's told them [to] [do] [but] they're [not] condemning [you] , [if you] , [we] [only] [have] one child , [you [know] ,] [they] [don't] say , [they] [don't] put [on] bad or anything which [is] good because [it] would be easy [, I'm] [sure] , for them [to] [do] that , [you] get [a] conviction [like] that [and] [you] [think] everyone should [have] [it] . [And] [so] [I'm] real proud [of] them because they're aren't really , [they] [don't] [do] that at [all] . 
B|98| M: [I] 
A|99| A: [You] go [in] their bathroom [and] there's ten tooth brushes [in] there . [And] [I] always give her [a] hard [time] whose toothbrush [did] [you] really use [this] morning 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: Uh-huh . [They] [live] lean for one thing [and] [they] tithe [and] [they] [it] puts [a] whole [in] your money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor God with [this] portion [and] [so] [they] [, I think] that helps [a] lot . [I think] that's [the] key , [in] he , [like] his sales [last] [year] he just works [a] normal job . [He] probably [has] an income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] [last] [year] he made that got him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash for [a] full size van . [He] loves God [, I] [mean] [, it was] [the] biggest thing that any one [in] [this] company had ever done , 
B|102| M:  
A|103| A: [and] he got [to] [do] [it] [and] [so] God just really blesses him [in] ways [like] that , [do] trust God because [, [I] don't [know] ,] kids [are] [a] blessing [and] , [and] some people [you [know] ,] [we] [think] [of] blessings as [nice] furniture [and] things [like] that [, but] kids [are] just as much [of a] blessing inside these material things [but] [it's] [a] different kind [and] [a] lot times people [think ,] oh , well [, [I'm] not] blessed [I] [have] an [old] [car .] But you've got five kids , [you [know] ,] 
B|104| M:  
A|105| A: [you're] just as blessed , probably more , because [if you] follow _this ,_ there's [a] good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING , by Richard Fugate 
B|106| M:  
A|107| A: [and] he's , [you [know] ,] [a] lot [of] wisdom [in] [it] . [And] [the] kids at BIBLE talk [about] anything [but] training , [and] training [is] different than anything else [in] , [in] psychology [doesn't] address [it] . A lot [of the] psychology stuff , [the] good stuff that's [in] psychology [it] just comes out [of the] BIBLE [and] [they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb out [of] [it] [, [but] the] things that work [in] psychology [other] [the] years that they've proven [to] work , [they] just come out [of the] BIBLE [and] [so] [this] book [it] just really [all] these things [and] how [to] train [the] child [so] they're [not] going [to] be [a] curse [to] [you] when they're thirteen . 
B|108| M: [they] 
A|109| A: [What] [I] [mean] how [to] train them [so] they're going [to] be [a] blessing [and] [so] , [you [know] ,] [they] [do] that [and] [they] , [they] just [live] lean [pretty] much [they] [don't] , [she] [doesn't] shop at Foley's [you [know] ,] [and] stuff [like] that . But [a] lot women die or shop at Foley's [so] things , 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [It's] [like a] Macy's , kind [of] store , 
B|112| M:  ... 
A|113| A: [it's] [pretty] [nice] [and] everything's [pretty] expensive [and] , [you [know] ,] [you] just can't [do] that [and] [you] [don't] go [to] baseball games as much or [you] get pictures [like] [we] [did .] [You know] _what_ [I] [mean ?] 
B|114| M: [I] love 
A|115| A: [You] [do] these fun things , [you [know] ,] [in] [other] kinds [of] ways [and] [I know] Manhattan's real expensive [but] , um [, it's] kind [of a] different situation because [you're] probably living [in] an apartment , [right] ? 
B|116| M: _I do_ [this [,] but] [I'm] [in] Manhattan . 
A|117| A: [Yeah] . 
B|118| M: [Oh , I] [see] . 
A|119| A: Well , church softball leagues [, so] , 
B|120| M: [I'm] [a little] confused , [what] [are] [you] talking [about] ? 
A|121| A: they're [not] [all] boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have] [a] girls' league because [I'm] [the] one that's supposed [to] start one [and] [I] just haven't gotten around [to] doing [it] . [I] keep saying [we] need [to] [have] one . [They] go , okay , then start one . But everybody wants [to] [do] [it] [but] , [you [know] ,] God's sitting [on] [my] heart [and] [I] just hadn't gotten around [to] doing [it] [, but] anyway [, so] [they] could really [only] [have] four members [on] [the team] . [I think] [they] [only] [have] four boys . [I don't] [even] [think] [they have] [but] two [old] [enough] [to] [play] yet . 
B|122| M:  
A|123| A: But , um , then [you] didn't believe [me] [about] her kids *listen: [this] [and] utt2 as one utt [are the] [they] [are] [so] good . [I'm not] kidding [you] [but] [she] does work with them [and] [it's] [a] commitment [and] , that , that's [what] they're called [to] [do] . 
B|124| M:  
A|125| A: [I] [have] [a] , most [of] [my] friends , 
B|126| M: I'ed [you] 
A|127| A: [I [know] [,] [I] do] too [, I] , most [of] [my] friends [have] three or four kids [and] [they] feel [like ,] [you [know] ,] that's really why God [and] some [of the] people [in] our church use birth control [and] some [of] them [don't] [, I] had [my] tubes tied [so] [you] ,
