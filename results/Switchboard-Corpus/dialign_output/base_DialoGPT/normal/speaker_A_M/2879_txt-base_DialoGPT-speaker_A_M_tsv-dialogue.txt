B|16| M:  
A|17| A: Is [it] , that's _good_ . 
B|18| M: You [can] shoot through 
A|19| A: Say _, that_ _good_ _, I think_ that's _, like_ _the state of_ Virginia , yeah , that's great . 
B|20| M: [I think] [, I think] ,, _about [,_ [that] [,] and] 
A|21| A: Uh-huh . 
B|22| M: [I , uh _,] I'm _not_ [,_ uh] ... 
A|23| A: Uh-huh .

B|26| M: Er , 
A|27| A: [I] mean _I don't_ _like_ guns _in_ general _but_ when [I think] [about [,] uh ,] _this_ topic _like_ capital punishment [I] look at somebody [, I] mean [, I] _just_ remember when [I] was _in_ college _in_ _a_ dorm [and] [I think] _if_ he'd been around one [of] my family members probably _would_ _have_ killed him _but_ _in_ Florida , _in _the_ state of_ Washington when _they_ had [the] Ted Bundy case 
B|28| M: [I] 
A|29| A: [and] how _they_ _just_ well , [it] hasn't been _just_ _but_ [it] was _in the_ [, I think] [the] second or third quarter [of] last _year_ , nineteen ninety 
B|30| M: The [year] [before] ? 
A|31| A: [and] [I] had _, you_ [know [,] I] knew some people [that] said , why are [you] glad _, you_ [you] [know ,] _this_ [is] nothing [, and] [I] said _just_ maybe [because] he got _a_ lot [of] media hype [and] all [that] _but_ [I] actually [, I] mean _in_ there should _be_ more cases _like_ [that] where _they_ flip _a_ [I] might _be_ too cold too _, but_ _they_ flip _a_ switch , 
B|32| M: [I] 
A|33| A: _I don't [know_ ,] 
B|34| M: i _have no_ [idea] _what_ i'm talking 
A|35| A: [I] mean , 
B|36| M: That's [, like] , your opinion , _man_ . 
A|37| A: [So] _many times_ . 
B|38| M: [and] _so_ [many times] 
A|39| A: Yeah . 
B|40| M: Oh . 
A|41| A: Yeah [, I] mean [, and] that's _just_ maybe [because] [of the] little more , _they_ said celebrated [that [,] uh ,] he's [not] [the] _only_ one _, you_ [know ,] 
B|42| M: i [know .] 
A|43| A: _you _,_ you_ see somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear [about] somebody's crime , there was something _on_ [, and] _this_ gets back _to_ capital punishment _, but_ [the] [man] had stolen [, uh ,] [not] stolen _but_ kidnapped [, uh ,] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere _in_ Florida [and] _they_ changed all [the] facts [that] _they_ said [it] was true 
B|44| M: Wait , _so_ [they] found [out] [about] [it] ? 
A|45| A: [and] [they] buried her alive 
B|46| M: [And] [the] murder 
A|47| A: [and] Peter Strauss had played [the] lead role [and] [the] [man] [, and] [, and] at [the] end _of _,_ you_ [know] how [they] [have] these mini dramas , at [the] end [they] said , _this_ set person was paroled [like] six months ago [and] you're thinking oh , that's nice . 
B|48| M: It's [good] 
A|49| A: [I] mean _, you_ [know [,] _I'm not] sure_ [that] capital punishment serves as _a_ deterrence _but_ [it] does serve as _a_ [uh ,] definite _, you_ [know ,] lasting 
B|50| M: I've never heard [that] [before] . I'll [have] [to] [check] [it] [out] . 
A|51| A: Right , _in_ [that] particular instance [, uh _,] but_ [I _,] but_ _I don't_ _, but_ [I _know] it's_ _on_ _a_ [and] all [and] _be_ all , 
B|52| M: Ahaaaaaaayyyy . 
A|53| A: that's [the] _problem_ [I] [have] with [it] , _in_ Texas [they] _think it's_ [and] all [and] _be_ all , [they] [think] [that] _if they_ electrocute or slip , or [do] something , or gas somebody [, uh [,] that] they're [not] _going_ [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] [they] [do] [have] [and] _we_ happen [to] _live in_ Dallas which [is] extremely crime , ridden , 
B|54| M:  
A|55| A: [and] _we_ _just_ moved _here_ [, uh ,] we've been _here_ [before] , lived _in_ Minneapolis , Saint Paul [, uh ,] which has an exceedingly low crime rate [, and] then _we_ were transferred back _here_ [, and] when you're gone from some place [like] [it] for [about] six years as _we_ were _, you_ really begin [to] see [, uh ,] _just_ how problematic _just_ living [is] , _even_ suburban , [no] matter where [you] are , 
B|56| M: [now ,] 
A|57| A: [and] how , you're _in_ , [Rome] , [New York] , 
B|58| M: [you] . 
A|59| A: _is that_ [and] [, and] _, is that_ [like] near Albany or Syracuse , 
B|60| M: [So] [, is that] [a] question ? 
A|61| A: _What_ , [what] type [of] _area_ [is [that] ,] 
B|62| M: [I] [live [in] the] middle [of] nowhere _, uh , and_ [uh [,] _I'm not] even_ [, uh] 
A|63| A: [is that] [in] term , 
B|64| M: [I'm] [in the] [area] 
A|65| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|66| M: [I don't know] what's [going] [on] [in this] picture [but] [it's] hilarious 
A|67| A: Sure . 
B|68| M: i [know [it's] a] joke [, but] [it's] still funny 
A|69| A: _How_ _would_ , how [is the] situation [in] there [in] terms [of] crime [and] [, and] things [that] _would_ , 
B|70| M: They [do] . 
A|71| A: [not] too _bad_ . Yeah . Uh-huh . 
B|72| M: [How] [bad] ? 
A|73| A: Not [the] harsh criminality [, that] [you] find [in] , 
B|74| M: _I can't_ _. _I_ can't_ [be] bothered [to] ,,, 
A|75| A: yeah , [now ,] Dallas _is a_ [I'm] _being_ very sarcastic , [it's] _just_ [a] great [, uh ,] [on] some days [, uh ,] [it's] [, [uh _,] I] don't know_ [the] [good] ole boy network _here_ [is] [, uh ,] very strange [, like] [I] said [they] believe [that ,] _if they_ kill somebody _, you_ [know ,] tit for tat [and] , deed for deed [that [,] that] does something [, uh ,] 
B|76| M:  
A|77| A: [but] yet [they] want spend [the] _money_ [to] build [the] new jails [that [,] I] mean , [they] really are over , crowded , 
B|78| M: Money [is] _their_ , [money] , [money] . 
A|79| A: [I] mean , that's , that's _just_ [not] [a] cop [out] [, uh , and] [I] _just_ _, you_ [know [,] I'm] originally from Pennsylvania which [I think] [is] basically [like] [New York] these days [, _I'm not] sure_ _if they_ _, I don't_ [think] [they] [have] capital punishment there . 
B|80| M: You're [, like] [, but ,] 
A|81| A: Uh-huh . Yeah [, and] [I'm] from _Pittsburgh_ [so] , oh , well , we'll forgive each other 
B|82| M: You [, [you] ,] uhhhh ... 
A|83| A: Uh [, because] [they] use [to] [be] very , very conservative when [I] was growing up [I] [and] [I can't] [, I] haven't lived there [in] twenty , years 
B|84| M: Uu ' 
A|85| A: [but [,] uh ,] 
B|86| M: It's ok , [we] [can] [live in] [Pittsburgh] 
A|87| A: There [you] go [I don't know] that's [a] different subject , altogether 
B|88| M: [I] [live [in] the] west part [, the] east [is] [like] [, I think] . 
A|89| A: [but [,] [uh _,] I] don't know_ [I think] everybody _would feel_ [it is] _same_ way _if they_ were _touched_ by crime [. _I] think everyone_ _would_ [, you] [and] [I think] are honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do it_ [on] , [in this] , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|90| M: [I'm not sure] [I'm] understanding [the] question 
A|91| A: [but] [I think] everybody _if they_ were _touched_ by [it] _would_ _say_ , _if they_ had _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought [out] [, I think] every human does [, I think] they'd _say_ , yeah , 
B|92| M: [I think everyone] [here] [would feel] [the] [same] [if they] [touched] 
A|93| A: _do it_ [if] somebody [in] my family or [if] [it] happened [it] _me_ [, you] [know ,] 
B|94| M: i [think it's] okay [if] [you] [do it] 
A|95| A: [uh ,] 
B|96| M: [no ,] i am _not ,_ 
A|97| A: Uh-huh . Yeah [, I] _just_ , [don't] [think] [that [,] uh [,] you] [can] rehabilitate [, I] mean [I] _just_ [don't] [, uh ,] oh [, I] did [a] paper back [in] college [a] long [time] ago for criminal justice class [, and] [I] _just_ [, the] subject [, I] remember [we] drew things [out] [of] [a] hat [and] [it] was something [, uh ,] [it] was basically [the] essence was does [the] crime fit [the] punishment [and] when [you] see how [many] repeat offenders there are [, uh ,] [check] , [check] fraud cases where [they] go [to] jail for five [to] ten years [and] [, uh ,] rape , rapist getting [their] hand , _just_ slapped [, you] [know [,] and] how [it is] based [on] [the] judge [and] [if] [the] [time] [of] day [that] [the] court [is] [in] session [, you] [know ,] all these [, uh ,] intangible things 
B|98| M:  
A|99| A: [and] you're thinking , oh [, you] [would] [not] _only_ [would] [you] [not] want [to] [be] [a] victim [you] wouldn't want [to] [be] [a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't _know what_ you're getting [, uh] 
B|100| M:  
A|101| A: [but _,] I don't [know_ ,] methods [of] capital punishment [I] [have no] opinions [on] [that] either [I] _just_ 
B|102| M: You 
A|103| A: Uh-huh . Is [it] [, uh ,] how [about] [the] injection , 
B|104| M: [I _don't] have_ [any] ideas [, I] [can] [you think] [of ,] u [do] , u , 
A|105| A: [is that] suppose [to] [be] . 
B|106| M: [I'm] sorry 
A|107| A: Yeah . [I'm not even] [sure] , [in the] split among [the] fifty states , [do you] [know] which way [it is the] ratio , [it's] more than , aren't [, uh ,] [it's] more [that] [don't have] [it] , 
B|108| M: It's [just] [the state of] [being] , _isn't_ [it] ? 
A|109| A: [isn't] [that] correct . 
B|110| M: The [only] thing [that] [is [a] problem] [is the] US . 
A|111| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|112| M: [What] ? You [can't] tell [me] [what] [to] [do] [, I don't [know] what] [to] [say] . 
A|113| A: Yeah [, I don't know] [if] they've , [they] did something [about] [I'm not sure] [if] Texas , Minnesota [, [I] ,] [they] didn't , [they] didn't , [they] were well , did [they] [have] [it] , [they] were against [it] [, uh ,] Texas , as [I] said , has [it] [but] [I] haven't been back [here] long enough [to] , [to] realize whether or [not ,] [if] they've done [it] [in the] last ,
