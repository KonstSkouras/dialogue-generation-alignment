A|31| A: [That] _don't ,_ [it ,] [it ,] [it] seems like , [I mean] , if wrestling _is_ prime _time_ , professional wrestling , [it] seems like [it's] [just] , [just] , [just] like pros [in] [a] wrestling [to] me , _I don't ,_ _I don't_ see any difference though , 
B|32| M: [I don't ,] 
A|33| A: [I] , [I don't] understand [it ,] _they_ consider [it] violent . [I have] so ever , [I have] _seen it_ [on] , where _we_ _are_ , [I] live [in] , uh , Rochester , _New_ York [, and] [I think] [a] , 
B|34| M: What _do_ [you] [not] 
A|35| A: Yes . 
B|36| M: _You_ [think] [this] [is] _the first_ [time] _I've [seen_ this] ?

B|40| M: It's [Sunday] morning [in New] England . 
A|41| A: [I think it's] been [on] , [I think] [I've _seen] it_ during _the day ._ 
B|42| M: [I've seen] _the news [,_ but] [I've] never [seen it] _in the middle_ [of] [the day .] 
A|43| A: Definitely [seen it] [on] , [on] , during [the day] down there [, and] [I don't] [think [it's] a] very violent _show_ , [I think it's] funny . [I think [it's] a] real _good_ concept , [I think it's] something completely new . 
B|44| M: Not ahem 
A|45| A: [I think] so , [I think] because _people_ sort [of] get through , [you] [know] , um , [I think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn [the] importance [of] sort [of] physical fitness as well as [the] , as well as , [you] [know] , _some_ mental fitness [and] [I think] [that] _people_ sort [of] learn _good_ sportsmanship [and] so forth . 
B|46| M: [you] 
A|47| A: Well , [don't] _they_ take _people who _have_ some_ sort [of] , um , big abilities like [and , and] at least _they_ used [to] when [it ,] when [it ,] [the first] ones [I] saw _they_ _had_ , um , [a] man [on] _who_ [was] , uh , _he_ played college football [and] almost went pro [, and] _they_ _had a_ , [a] woman _who_ [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] [the] , uh , she [was] [in the] junior Olympics or something or _they_ seem [to] [have] _people who have_ very , very big sports backgrounds . To [have] _they_ , leaned away from [that] sort [of] , 
B|48| M: [what] . lol 
A|49| A: Oh [, that's] _how_ _they_ _do it ._ 
B|50| M: [I] 
A|51| A: Really ? 
B|52| M: [So] . 
A|53| A: Yeah , okay , [I] [just] thought _they_ _had_ _some_ , 
B|54| M: They're [just] making [a] joke . 
A|55| A: yeah , [I] thought _they_ _had_ _some_ sort [of] , [I mean] , [I] thought _they_ were [just] poor _people_ like us [I] guess [not] [, that's] great . 
B|56| M: They're pretty [good] . 
A|57| A: But , maybe I'll try [it] one [day .] I'll get [on] there one [day] [and] see if [I] can , uh , um , [what] , [what] [do] _they_ win , _they_ , _they_ win _money_ [I think] , [don't] _they_ ? 
B|58| M: Not much [, but] _they [have_ some] 
A|59| A: Really ? 
B|60| M: [There's] [a lot of] [people who have] [a lot] more [money] than [I] [do] . 
A|61| A: Wow . All [that] for getting tennis balls shot at [you] at [a] hundred miles an hour . 
B|62| M: How much ? 
A|63| A: One [little] ball here [and] there , yeah [, and] [this] guy's beating [you] up , so , [I [don't] know] [the] beating up part . [I] , [I] actually feel [the] tennis balls would hurt . 
B|64| M: [I think] [he] [was] [just] making [a] joke . 
A|65| A: They look like , Yeah , [they] seem like [a] tennis ball [but] [it] almost doesn't look like [it's] almost livable yeah , [the best] [I] , [I don't] [think] [I] could , [I] , [I] could handle those tennis balls . [So] , [what] else [to] [you tape] besides AMERICAN at , there anything else ? 
B|66| M: This 
A|67| A: _Huh ?_ 
B|68| M: We're 
A|69| A: Okay . 
B|70| M: [I'm] gonna [tape] [my] fingers [to] [my] nails [, I'm] gonna [do it .] 
A|71| A: Oh , okay . 
B|72| M: [There's] [no] reason [to be] scared . 
A|73| A: Uh-huh . 
B|74| M: Hm ? [Huh ?] 
A|75| A: But [, I'm] sure [that's] fun . 
B|76| M:  ... [I'm a] girl . 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . Oh , okay , well , [they] seem [to be on] later , 
B|78| M: That's [not] [really] [the] case [, I've] never [had a] case [in] which [the] defendant [was] [not] involved . 
A|79| A: _all_ , always _right_ _, right_ before [the news] [is] when [I] catch them . [I] , [I] tend [to] , if nothing else [is] [in the] town television at eleven o'clock [just] [to] watch [the news [,] and] or , or NIGHTLINE or something , [just] sort [of] get [a] [good] , [you] [know] , [a] [good] , [a] [good] [think] for [the day .] 
B|80| M: Uhm . 
A|81| A: Yes . When [is] yours _on ?_ 
B|82| M: [is] _your_ [news] [on ?] 
A|83| A: Oh , gosh , well [, I'm] sorry [I] interrupted , um , 
B|84| M: _I was_ [just] kidding . 
A|85| A: Yeah , ours [is] [on] , 
B|86| M: _We_ [are] [all] [in _the] same_ place [, right] ? 
A|87| A: actually [it ,] ours [is] [on] at eleven [it [,] it's] , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty-five now here [in New] York . Um , [I think] [they] [they] [do] [that] , [I think] [they] put things [on] at , um , eleven o'clock here [and] [I think] [they] put [it] like eleven o'clock , um , California [time] , like [in] California [but] [in the middle] [they] sort [of] , um , like central [time] or mountain [time] [they] , [they] push things back . [So] , [I was] actually , actually [I'm] [not] sure , [I was] [in] , [I was] [in] Iowa awhile ago [, and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier , so , does [your] prime [time] start at seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M:  
A|89| A: Wait , [no] , [no] , 
B|90| M: [I] ... 
A|91| A: [not] , [not] even [the news] [but] [do] [they have] like , um , [do] like sort [of] [all] [the] regular sitcoms [and] so forth , start at seven o'clock ? [You] , so , like , [you] [know] , [the] regular television shows [that] [are] , [that] [are] very popular , [do] [they] start at , seven or , or at eight ? 
B|92| M:  
A|93| A: Right , because [that] would [the] eight o'clock here . 
B|94| M: It's [the] [show .] 
A|95| A: Yeah , [that] , [that] would [all] start at , at , um , [that] would [all] start at , at eight o'clock here , [that] wouldn't start at seven . [We] [have] , um , at seven o'clock _we_ [just] [have] , um , [the] , they'll play , [you] [know] , [they have] old reruns [of] CHEERS or something from seven [to] seven thirty [, and] then something else from seven thirty [to] eight 
B|96| M:  
A|97| A: [and] ours start at , at , at , at eight [and] end at eleven [, that's] why _we_ . [I] , [I] would actually like [it] better if everything started at seven [and] ended at ten . 
B|98| M: [how] [do] [we] could'a [, [and] ,] i , 
A|99| A: Oh [, that's] great . 
B|100| M: That's 
A|101| A: Oh , [all] [the] [time] . Do [you] watch CHEERS 
B|102| M: What [is] [it] ? 
A|103| A: [it's] at , [that] [was] actually [a] big dilemma for me now because , um , CHEERS , CHEERS [and] TWIN PEAKS [are] now [on [the] same] [time] ,
