A|3| A: Uh-huh . 
B|4| M: _You_ _have_ _a good_ point _. I_ wonder what _the_ _other _people_ are_ _like_ . 
A|5| A: _You _know_ _,_ _I_ _,_ I_ _really_ agree _with_ _you_ . Um _, _I_ , uh ,_ though _I've_ never done _that_ myself _, _I_ _,_ I'm_ , _was_ [a] basically an education major when [I] graduated _from_ _college_ _and_ [I] accepted [a] job _that_ at [the] _time_ _was_ _just_ slightly above [the] _poverty_ level [to] teach [to] _, um ,_ very rural children _in_ [a] very low income district _and_ [I] spent [a] year teaching there 
B|6| M: i 
A|7| A: _and_ [I think] _it_ _was_ probably one _of_ my largest eye-opening experiences because [I] come _from_ nice middle class white suburban home 
B|8| M: i [know] . 
A|9| A: _and_ [I] did _it_ _, um ,_ _for_ one reason [I] wanted _, _I_ was_ working on [a] masters degree _so_ [I] wanted [to] stay close [to] where _I was_ working on [a] masters degree _, but_ also because [I] _just_ thought _that_ _it_ _would be_ _interesting_ [to] live _some_ place else _so_ totally different _than_ my _own_ up bringing 
B|10| M:  ... 
A|11| A: _and_ _I _,_ it_ changed _, it_ probably changed my political views _it_ changed my understanding _of the world_ _around_ me 
B|12| M: i [think] _you should_ visit [some] places . 
A|13| A: _and_ [I think] _, um _,_ in_ fact , _if_ [I] had [to] _do_ _it_ all again _I ,_ [you] _know ,_ after _that_ , [you] _know ,_ [you] never [think] _of_ _it_ because _, I guess_ because [I] paid _for_ all _of_ my _college_ education myself _, I_ never thought _about_ doing _that_ because [I] had all these _college_ loans I'd started paying [back] . 
B|14| M: Uhh . 
A|15| A: Um , _so_ _that_ _was_ , _that_ _was_ one reason _why_ [I] never considered _it_ _but_ now _that_ _I'm_ further along , _and_ _I'm_ _still_ paying these _college_ loans _, _I_ _,_ I think_ realistically , [you] _know ,_ _you can_ [have] _your_ _college_ loans delayed now , because [I] had _them_ delayed because _I'm_ [back] _in_ graduate _school_ at thirty years old , 
B|16| M: [I ,] 
A|17| A: _um , I_ had _them_ delayed because _I'm_ [back] _in_ graduate _school_ _and_ on _that_ form _it_ says _if_ _your_ joining [the] Peace Corps _you can_ [have] _them_ delayed 
B|18| M: [I] [have] [time] 
A|19| A: _and_ [I] thought _that_ _was_ , [you] _know ,_ very _interesting_ _and_ [I _,] I_ _would_ [have] thought _of_ _that_ earlier [I] probably _would_ [have] done , [you] _know ,_ _just_ [like] , _is_ _that_ , _is_ this , _is_ _that the_ Mormon church , _that_ does _that_ ? 
B|20| M: Yes , [of] course 
A|21| A: _Because_ one [of] my neighbors _, uh ,_ did _that_ _in_ Pittsburgh , _from_ Pittsburgh . 
B|22| M: [I , uh _,] I think _I_ know_ what [you] mean . 
A|23| A: _And_ [I] thought , [you] _know ,_ _that_ _really ,_ now _that_ _I'm_ thirty years old [, I think] _that_ one or two years _out_ [of] my life _would_ [have] , probably [like] [you] said , _to be_ able [to] travel [some] place else whether _it_ _be the_ United States or outside [the] _country_ [, I think] _it_ _would_ _have been_ [a] very [good] _, um ,_ experience _for_ me . 
B|24| M: Us . 
A|25| A: Uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [I'm] not [really [,] I'm] 
A|27| A: Uh-huh . 
B|28| M:  ... _how_ [about] 
A|29| A: Uh-huh . _Yeah_ . _And_ [I think] , [you] _know ,_ _we_ [have] such [a] need now , [you] _know [,_ I] taught , [you] _know [,_ [I] [,] I think _I] was_ paid [, uh ,] [about] nine thousand dollars [to] teach _for_ [the] year 
B|30| M: [I'm] [so] 
A|31| A: _and_ [I] worked _in_ [a] very rural _school_ district _and_ [I [,] [I] ,] one _of the_ _things_ [I] taught _was_ [a] computer class 
B|32| M: Uuhuh 
A|33| A: _and_ these kids _, um ,_ [you] _know ,_ every _girl_ [I] taught , except _for_ one , _was_ pregnant . 
B|34| M: [I , uh [,] uh] 
A|35| A: Many _of the_ boys _in the_ room had children _and_ _they were_ , _they were_ _high school_ juniors . 
B|36| M: [I'm] not [a] child [, I'm] [a] [high school] junior . 
A|37| A: _And_ [I] _just_ , there , [you] _know ,_ _they_ came _from_ _poverty_ , _they were_ going [to] condition _in_ _poverty_ _and_ _it_ _was_ _, it_ _was_ , [the] [school] district couldn't hire _many people_ _, it_ _was_ very difficult _for them_ [to] hire , _and_ [I think] , [you] _know _,_ in the_ sense , _that_ aspect [of] public service _for_ education _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _for_ _, um ,_ _just_ social workers _in_ _some _of_ the_ inner cities _and_ _some _of_ the_ rural areas where _they_ _just_ need advice on medical _, um ,_ _things_ [, I think] [it's] [a] [really] [good] idea . _And_ even _if_ _it is_ overseas . 
B|38| M:  
A|39| A: See [, I] never [, [I] [,] I] tell [you] sometimes [I] worry [about] _things_ over seas because _we_ [have] such problems _right_ here _in_ our _own_ _country_ . 
B|40| M: [I'm] 
A|41| A: Uh-huh . 
B|42| M: [I'm] . [of] . 
A|43| A: _Yeah_ . Uh-huh . _Yeah_ . 
B|44| M: [I'm] [from] [the] UK . 
A|45| A: Right . Uh-huh . 
B|46| M: [And] [it's] [still] not _the most_ popular [country] [in [the] world] . 
A|47| A: Uh-huh . 
B|48| M: Uhh [, um] . Yes . 
A|49| A: Uh-huh . 
B|50| M: [Because] [they] _are_ better [than] [the] _other_ _students_ . 
A|51| A: _Yeah_ [. [I] think] _it_ _would_ also help _them_ _if they_ _then_ went on [to] _college_ [. [I] know] _that_ my first couple [of] years [of] _college_ _were_ _, um [,_ uh ,] probably [too] carefree at [the] , beginning 
B|52| M: What [if they] [have been] [in] [college] [for] [a] while ? 
A|53| A: _and_ _then_ at [the] end [I] had _to be_ _too serious ._ 
B|54| M: Uhh [, I think] [they were] [just] [a] bit [too serious .] 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [And] [then] [you] get [to be] [a] little [girl] [and] get [to] hang [out] [with] [them] . 
A|57| A: _Yeah _,_ that's_ true . 
B|58| M: _That's_ [why] [you] [have] [to] take [a] vow [of] [poverty] . 
A|59| A: Uh-huh _, that's_ _right ._ 
B|60| M: They [do] [a] LOT [of] [things] _that _we_ don't_ . 
A|61| A: [I _,] yeah [, I_ think] [, I think] this _was_ , this _was_ [a] very _interesting_ topic [uh ,] because [it's] something [that] , [you] _know ,_ [we don't] talk [about] [in] this [country] probably enough . 
B|62| M: _Oh ,_ well [, yeah [, I] guess] [that's] [interesting] 
A|63| A: _Uh ,_ [you] _know ,_ 
B|64| M: No [, I] [don't] [know] . 
A|65| A: Uh-huh . _Yeah _,_ that's_ true . 
B|66| M: [Because] [of the] freedom [of] choices [, I guess] . 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| M: Uuhh [, _that's] , uh ,_ weird . 
A|69| A: _Oh [, I_ think] _it is ._ 
B|70| M: No _, it's_ not . 
A|71| A: [I] [really] [think] [, I think] _, um ,_ [people] , [you should] [, [I] ,] [you] _know ,_ [the] kids today [I] teach [, I] spend _a lot of_ my [time] teaching [college] [students] 
B|72| M: [I think] you're wrong [, I'm] [right .] 
A|73| A: [and] _, um , _I_ find great_ disgust _in _them_ , in their _, in_ their _,_ um ,_ _their_ self-centeredness [and] _their_ inability [to] _understand _,_ um ,_ multicultural or multiracial situation 
B|74| M: [I find great] disdain [for [them] , in their [, in] the] self centeredness [, [in] them] self centered [, in] themselves . 
A|75| A: [and] [I] [really ,] [you] _know ,_ [they] [don't] _understand [,_ uh ,] [how] [other people] live _, um ,_ [they] [don't] _understand ,_ 
B|76| M: [You know] what , you're [right .] 
A|77| A: Uh-huh . _Yeah [,_ I think] [that's , uh ,] [just] having [a good] [time] . 
B|78| M: [I [know] [,] but] [uh [,] I'm] [uh [,] uh [,] um , I] [don't] [really] [understand ,] 
A|79| A: [I , uh ,] [a] friend [of] mine _is a_ psychologist [and] he always refers [to] _it_ _as_ short-term pleasure oriented [. [I] guess] he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] _it_ , [you] [know ,] 
B|80| M: [Oh ,] okay . 
A|81| A: today's young [people are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|82| M: Today's youth _are the_ future [of the world] . 
A|83| A: [and] everything has [to be] an immediate _reward_ [and] _it_ has [to be] fun . 
B|84| M: Paper [is a] [reward] [for] [a lot of] [things] . 
A|85| A: Uh-huh . _Yeah_ . 
B|86| M: i [think] [you can] _make_ [your] [own] . 
A|87| A: _Well ,_ [they] say [, I think [I] [,] um ,] [have] read recently [that] [, uh ,] [the] Bush Administration has increased [the] funding [for] [the] Peace Corps . 
B|88| M: [Well _,] it's_ _the most_ peaceful thing [I've] ever heard . 
A|89| A: Uh-huh . [Because] [I guess] because [of the] changes [in] Eastern Europe [, uh ,] they've increased funding [for] [the] Peace Corps . Some [of the] [, I guess] [it's] _some [of_ the] peace dividend [in the] sense , [you] known , 
B|90| M: [Uh [,] uh [,] yeah] . 
A|91| A: when [they're] decreasing _some [of_ the] military spending _, some of_ [that] _money_ has gone into [the] Peace Corps 
B|92| M: [Well ,] [they're] not wrong . 
A|93| A: [and] _some [of_ the] [are the] overseas programs [. [Uh] ,] 
B|94| M: [Yeah [,] some of] [them] . 
A|95| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|96| M: What [do] [you] mean ? 
A|97| A: [Yeah] . [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|98| M: Ohhuh . 
A|99| A: Uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [I] [don't] [know ,] maybe . 
A|101| A: [Yeah [,] that's] very true . [You [know] ,] _how many_ , [is] _it_ [they] say [we] [have] [so] _many lawyers_ [in] this [country] , [and] [I guess] [, [I] [,] I] live near Washington , being [in] [, in] Baltimore [, it's] something [like] one [in] four [people] [, in the] Washington , area , [are] _lawyers_ , 
B|102| M: There [are] [many lawyers] . 
A|103| A: [And] , [and] [I] [just] sort [of] [think] [that's] ridiculous . 
B|104| M: It's [just] [a] joke . 
A|105| A: [Yeah ,] [with] [with] [the] [great] needs [that we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and] [, uh ,] [you] [know ,] [the] , [the] problems [we] [have] [with] AIDS [and] cancer [and] , [and] [how] come everybody [is a] lawyer , [you] [know ,] [you] [know] 
B|106| M:  
A|107| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|108| M: [I] can't believe [that's] [how [many] people] [have been] [to] [the] moon . 
A|109| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] [you] saw , statistics [that] [lawyers] [and] _doctors make_ [the most] _money_ [in the] long run . 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|112| M: [Oh , I] see [. [I] was] thinking [that the] [money] [would [be] the] same [as] [the] [money] [that] [doctors make] . 
A|113| A: [That's] [interesting] . Uh-huh . 
B|114| M: Yes [, [it] is .] 
A|115| A: Okay . Hey , thanks [so] much [for] [the] conversation . 
B|116| M: I'll [be] [around] . 
A|117| A: [Well ,] thank [you] very much . Bye-bye .
