A|43| A: Which [is] rare . 
B|44| M: You could always cheer [for] [the] _Cowboys_ 
A|45| A: Which [is] [good] . Yeah .

[I think] _football_ [is] , _football_ [is] kind [of] [a] , [a] sport that [I think] [you] kind [of] _, it's_ hard [not] [to] _like_ [it] . Because [you know] there's [just] , 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: [It's] _exciting_ .
