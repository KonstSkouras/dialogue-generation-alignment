B|24| M: It's [the] whole point [of the] article . 
A|25| A: [Yeah] . _And_ , again _, I_ don't _, I_ _mean_ got [know] [the] _, you know ,_ how qualified _, I_ _mean _,_ I_ think it'd [be] interesting [to _,] you know [,_ to] spend [a] couple [of] days _just_ looking around an inner city [school .] Uh _, you know ,_ sort , sort [of] maybe from elementary through _, uh ,_ high [school .] [You _know] ,_ _just_ sort [of] [to] get [a] feel for what [it's] _like_ . 
B|26| M:  
A|27| A: [I] think that'd [be] an interesting experience . _But_ _, uh _,_ I_ haven't _done_ _that_ 
B|28| M: [I] . 
A|29| A: _But_ [I] do _, I_ do think _that _,_ uh _,_ I_ _mean ,_ public education [in] general [I] think _can_ work . _And_ [I] think [it's] [a] good _thing_ . 
B|30| M: No [, I] [can] . 
A|31| A: [Yeah] .

A|35| A: [Yeah] . [Yeah] . [I] [mean [,] I] don't [, I] honestly don't really think [I] [could] have _, you know ,_ _done _much_ better_ than [I] did [in] [the school] system [I] was [in] . [mean] 
B|36| M: It's not [that] bad . It's [just] [that , you know ,] you're not [the] best at this . 
A|37| A: [Yeah] . 
B|38| M: [But] [you] could've [done much] , [much better] . 
A|39| A: [Yeah] . [I] [mean ,] and and [in] [the] , once [you] junior high [, uh ,] start junior high , starting [in] eighth grade all [the] way through high [school ,] there were four levels .
