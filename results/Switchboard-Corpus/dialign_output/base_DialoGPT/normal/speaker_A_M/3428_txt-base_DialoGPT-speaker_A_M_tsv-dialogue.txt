A|1| A: Yeah , _I_ can , _I_ can understand _that ._ _I_ was raised in Oklahoma [, and] of course , being Oklahoman [and] Texan , uh , yeah , the hunting [and] everything [, and] _I_ used to things in my father [and] my husband having guns [and] all [, and] _I_ , _I_ did , used to be all in favor of it , but it's , all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs . Yet _I_ _think_ _I_ would vote a one if _I_ thought [that] it would be nation wide [and] they can guarantee no one would have a gun , no crooks , nothing . But because _I_ know that's not going to happen _, then_ _I_ have to probably right up there about an eight 
B|2| M:  
A|3| A: Well , it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten _so_ much worse than it was . There's always been a certain amount of crime in your , you know , your urban areas [, and] _I_ know we lived in Chicago for seven years [, and] of course it was definitely there . So when we first moved here , it wasn't as bad as this . It's , you know , it's just getting all of a sudden _so_ much worse . _I don't_ know whether it's due to the drugs [and] the , uh , drug kings [that] are here [and] Jamaican drug kings coming in . _I don't_ know whether that's it , or street gangs . _I don't_ know what the answer is . _I_ know [that] it's scary [, and] yet _I_ hate the government constantly telling me what _I_ can _do_ [and] what _I_ can't _do_ [, and] that's basically what the gun control would end up being . 
B|4| M:  
A|5| A: Well , it's very true . 
B|6| M:  . Why . [that] 
A|7| A: It's not the law abiding citizen [that ,] you know , is , is dangerous with the gun It's the ones [that] are going out [and] stealing it . 
B|8| M:  
A|9| A: And _I_ said _I_ _think_ the only way _I_ would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee [that] nobody would have them . And _I_ _think_ [that] would almost have to go with armies , too . _I_ mean , they'd have to be almost world-wide , which we know would never ever happen . 
B|10| M: [I don't] [think] [so] . 
A|11| A: Because even if you said , okay , you know , armed forces could have them , some idiot would come out [and] sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck . 
B|12| M: Why [do] [that .] 
A|13| A: That's very true very true . Who knows , we maybe want to overthrow the government 
B|14| M:  ... 
A|15| A: [I] know , if somebody doesn't [do] something . Uh , what about , uh , what [do] you [think] of this , this , uh , law [that] they're putting into effect [that] you have to wait X number of days before you can , uh , carry the gun , or buy , you know , actually purchase the gun ? 
B|16| M: How [, then] . 
A|17| A: _Yes ._ 
B|18| M: No . [Yes .]
