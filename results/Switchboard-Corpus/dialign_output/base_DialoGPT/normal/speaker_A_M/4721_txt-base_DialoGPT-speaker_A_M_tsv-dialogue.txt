B|0| M: _you_ ? 
A|1| A: _and_ _I_ was _going_ through _a_ divorce _and_ _I just_ found _that_ _running_ really made me _feel_ _good_ . 
B|2| M: _I love_ [running] _, _I_ love_ _exercise_ _, I'm_ [a] runner _, I just_ _like_ [running] . 
A|3| A: Got out _a lot of_ aggression _. I_ went _to_ _the gym_ every day _and_ [I] ran on _the_ treadmill _and_ rode _the_ bike _and_ , uh [, I] felt really _good_ _. I_ needed _to_ _do it_ _and_ _it_ was really helpful at _the_ _time ._ Now when _I do_ those things , they're boring _. I_ would rather _be_ outside then _in the gym_ _doing_ this _in_ one place . 
B|4| M: Nope . 
A|5| A: And _so_ [I just] recently discovered jazzercise , about two months ago . And [I'm] getting _to be_ _a good_ dancer from _it_ _and_ [I'm] [just] feeling really _good_ _. [I_ love] _the_ class _, it's_ real challenging , _so_ [I'm] really into _that_ [, I] really [like] _that_ _a lot_ . 
B|6| M: congrats . 
A|7| A: It _is_ _, it's_ aerobics _but_ _it's_ with dance steps . 
B|8| M: That's 
A|9| A: _It's_ an aerobic [exercise] _and_ _it's_ an hour straight . And _it's_ [just] , uh _, it's _a_ lot of_ _fun ._ 
B|10| M: What [is] 
A|11| A: _and_ [I'm] [, I'm] getting much better . My stamina [is] getting great _for_ _the_ dance floor _so_ _I mean_ _it's_ [just] , 
B|12| M: That's what [I mean] . 
A|13| A: _there's_ _a lot of_ positive things with _it_ , _so ._ 
B|14| M: [It's] [a good] game [. I] [like] _it _._ It's_ [fun _.] It's_ _not_ [a] chore [to] play . 
A|15| A: It [is] _inside_ _and_ I've been _doing_ _a lot of_ bike riding outside with _the_ _nice_ weather we've been having 
B|16| M: _I don't_ _know_ what's [inside] , _but I_ [like] _it ._ 
A|17| A: _and_ [I just] enjoy _that_ much _more_ _too_ than [inside] . 
B|18| M: That's [a good] idea . I'll _take _it_ ._ 
A|19| A: [I] _have a_ thirteen year old daughter _and_ _so_ we _go_ bike riding _and_ _it's_ _nice ._ We _get_ [to] spend some _time_ together rather than [I] _go_ [to] _the gym_ while she does her homework . 
B|20| M: What _are_ _you_ [doing] [for] [a] week ? 
A|21| A: So I've enjoyed _that_ part _of_ [it .] _Yeah_ . And at _the gym_ , even _in the_ class , uh [, I] _, it's_ [not] really [a] group where [you] chat _a lot_ . Everybody's on their way [to] someplace 
B|22| M: [I'm] 
A|23| A: _and_ _so_ _, you _know_ , _I_ do_ _have_ one friend who goes occasionally 
B|24| M: [It's] [not] . 
A|25| A: [but] , basically [, _I] _do_ it_ by myself _in_ [a] group _of_ _maybe_ forty _so ._ 
B|26| M: _Yeah [,_ it's a] bit [of] [a] problem , [but] [I'm] [not] [going] [to be] alone [in the gym] 
A|27| A: There [are] , there _are [._ It's] _more_ motivating _that_ way _, I think_ . [Yeah] . 
B|28| M: Oh [, you know] . 
A|29| A: _You could_ _get _a_ tape_ _probably_ _and_ _do it_ at home [in] front [of] [the] T V [but] [you] _probably_ wouldn't . 
B|30| M: [I] [could] [probably] [get a] tv [in the] middle [of] [a] city . 
A|31| A: So . 
B|32| M: Yes . Yes . _But_ . If [you] [have [a] tape] [and] can't [do [it] .] 
A|33| A: [Yeah] . 
B|34| M: [You could] also use [a tape] recorder , [maybe] . 
A|35| A: [Yeah _,] _yeah_ [,_ _I] can_ see it'll [be] [a good] break .

B|42| M: [I] [feel] [like] [I can] [go] back [to] sleep . 
A|43| A: _You owe_ _it to_ _yourself_ 
B|44| M: _I don't_ _know , I just_ [do .] 
A|45| A: [and] _I think_ [you] [do] accomplish _more_ after _that_ . 
B|46| M: [I think] [so [.] You] [do . You feel very] happy [. You] [are .] full [of] . [yourself .] For . [the] . full . [time .] [you] [are .] alone [. _You] [have_ a] [nice .] life [. You] deserve . [it [.] [You] owe] . [it _to] ._ [it .] 
A|47| A: And [I think] _that_ [it's] [just] [is] [good] [for] your self-esteem , [for] everything because when [you] look better [, you] [feel] better [and] [it's] [just] , uh _, I think_ [it's] well worth [it [.] [I] just] demand _that_ [time] [for] myself . Now I've learned [to] [do] _that_ 
B|48| M: _I think it_ [is] . 
A|49| A: [and] [, you [know] ,] [and] [it's] _, [I think_ it] [just] benefits [you] all around . So . 
B|50| M: Yes [, I think] [I [do] .] 
A|51| A: [You _have] [to_ .] Because _there's_ always _more_ things [to] [do .] 
B|52| M: What [is] [that] ? 
A|53| A: There [is] always things [that] [you] [can] make priority _to it_ [but [I] just] [, [I] don't] demand _a lot_ [for] myself [and] [so] [you [know] , I just] [feel] entitled _to it_ 
B|54| M: Well [, I think] [there's] [more] [to [it] .] 
A|55| A: [and] [I] [take it] [so .] 
B|56| M: [You] dont [have to] 
A|57| A: No , I've done some _walking_ with friends [in the] past . 
B|58| M: Have [you] ? 
A|59| A: [But] [I] find [that] when [you] [do] [that] [, you] [do] [more] chatting than [you] [do] [exercise] 
B|60| M: [I do] [a lot of] [walking] . 
A|61| A: [and] that's [not] really beneficial , [so] , uh [I don't] [have] [time] [like] [that] 
B|62| M: [I'm] [not] [too] sure . 
A|63| A: [and] [I] spend enough [time] chatting around everywhere [, you know]
