B|0| M: Um , I'm _not_ _really_ sure _, but it's_ an _interesting_ question . 
A|1| A: and , uh , _they_ had basically decided _that_ there _is_ going _to_ be _a_ real problem here within _a_ few years on solid waste . 
B|2| M: Umm ... _I_ think that's [a] myth . 
A|3| A: Well , [it's] [not] too _new_ . 
B|4| M: i mean _, it_ [is] [new] 
A|5| A: Oh , _they_ [really] didn't propose any solutions . Actually , _they_ were , _the_ guy was pretty negative about _the_ things _that_ _the_ government was doing _even_ though he was from _the_ E P A . 
B|6| M: That's _what_ [they] _want_ _you_ [to] think . 
A|7| A: _But_ , he had [a] lot of , uh , facts [to] , [to] give and , uh , things like _how_ many solid waste plants were being shut down and , and , uh , one of _the_ most [interesting] things _that_ he was talking about was recycling of , of news print . He was talking about , uh , _the_ City of New York and _how_ [they] went and collected all this news print 
B|8| M: I'morry 
A|9| A: and [they] could sell [it] for [a] while . They were able [to] sell [it] for some amount per ton and now at this stage of _the_ game where [they] have gotten into recycling , they've collected so much news print _that_ [they] have [to] pay [to] have [it] hauled away . 
B|10| M: The money 
A|11| A: _Yeah_ . We're doing some here in , in Cash Valley , _the_ community here . 
B|12| M:  . 
A|13| A: There's , uh , we've actually got [a] kind of [a] nice set up . We've got [a] couple of plants here _that_ actually take , uh , recycled paper and shred [it] and spray [it] with chemical treatment so _that_ [it's] [not] [a] fire hazard and make [it] into insulation 
B|14| M: c' ? 
A|15| A: and [they] can actually use as much recycled paper as _the_ community can _get_ [to] them . Because [they] are actually buying [it] and shipping [it] in from outside . 
B|16| M: [But] [they] _can't_ [get] [it] _back_ . 
A|17| A: So one of _the_ real keys [, it] sounds like , [to] getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like _that_ [to] go [is] [to] [get] some sort of business [to] actually [want] [it] once [you] have collected [it] . 
B|18| M: I'm interested 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: U ? 
A|21| A: And there was [a] paper presented at this conference from [a] guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired [to] do [a] study by two departments for _the_ government . One was like , environmental protection and _the_ other one was , oh , [I] [can't] remember [what] [, but] _the_ basic idea [, it] was presented [to] him was _how_ can we maximize _the_ amount of energy _that_ we can [get] [back] from recycling and minimize _the_ volume of stuff _that_ we are putting into our landfill 
B|22| M: [the] recycle recycle 
A|23| A: and , uh , [the] solution _that_ he came up with for plastics , and [it] was [really] quite amazing , he says , well [the] best thing [to] do with plastics [is] [to] burn them . 
B|24| M:  ... 
A|25| A: He came [to] [the] conclusion , plastics [is] actually one of [the] biggest problems in landfills cause [it's] , [it's] low weight [, but it's] high volume so [it] takes up [a] lot of space 
B|26| M: [I] hate 
A|27| A: and there's almost no energy , there's very little energy value in actually doing [a] lot of [the] recycling [, but] there [is] [a] lot of energy in [it] if [you] can burn [it] and use [it] , produce electricity . 
B|28| M: I'msigh 
A|29| A: So his solution was [to] burn plastic . Collect [it] and burn [it] . 
B|30| M: Why ? What's [the] point ? 
A|31| A: _Yeah_ . And [it's] more than _even_ paper or something like _that_ . There [is] more energy in [it] per pound or whatever . Well _that_ was he didn't deal with _that_ . 
B|32| M: Carbon fuel 
A|33| A: He just said burn [it] . 
B|34| M: How [is] [that] [even] possible ? 
A|35| A: He didn't talk about cleaning [it] up or anything like [that] . So [it's] [not] very practical 
B|36| M: _Yeah [,_ but] what's [the] point ? 
A|37| A: [Yeah ,] well , real [interesting] . 
B|38| M: You don't know [how] [it] works ? 
A|39| A: Uh , [not] too much . Uh , [I] got [a] bit . Actually ,
