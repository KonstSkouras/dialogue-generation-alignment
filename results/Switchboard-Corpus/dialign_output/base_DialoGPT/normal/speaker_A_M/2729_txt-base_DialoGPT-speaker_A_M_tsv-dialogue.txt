A|62| A: [That's] _not too_ bad . Golly [the] Golden Retrievers are [good] dogs _too_ _, they're_ kind _of_ [like] , get [that] permanent smile [to] them , 
B|63| M: Rosebtwink 
A|64| A: _they're_ always , always happy . [I don't think] I've ever [seen] them [not] look happy . 
B|65| M:  
A|66| A: [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: Is [that] _a dog_ ? 
A|68| A: Right . 
B|69| M: [She's] [so] cute . 
A|70| A: [This] , [this] friend _of_ mine has , _well_ [it's] [the] same guy [that] [was] watching [, uh ,] _my_ German Shepherd when _he_ [got] hit _, but_ [, uh ,] went _fishing_ with [him] on Friday [and] took _, he's_ [got] [a] full [, a] pure bred Golden Retriever [and] _then_ [I] [had] [, uh ,] _the puppy_ [, a] little tiny _puppy_ [and] we went [and] took [the] two dogs up _fishing ._ _And_ [this] , they [just] , they [had a] ball romping around , 
B|71| M:  
A|72| A: [and] _, you know_ _, you_ [can't] get [a] Golden Retriever near _water_ without [it] jumping _in_ . 
B|73| M: [the] . [my] . [the] . [water] . 
A|74| A: _And_ [, uh ,] [this] Golden Retriever jumped _in the_ , [the] , really fast moving [, uh ,] _river_ current , [and] [, uh] . 
B|75| M: _I'll_ [go] [fishing] [for] you're [fishing] [, _you] ,_ [fishing] [, they're] [fishing .] 
A|76| A: Well _no_ , actually _he_ [had] _no_ trouble at all [. He] first jumped _in_ [and I] _, he's_ _, he's_ [just] [about] [a] [year] old himself [and] never [had] really [, [I] don't think] he'd swum before . 
B|77| M: What [a great] story . He's [so] [good] . 
A|78| A: [But] _he_ jumped _in_ , _in the_ , _the river ._ 
B|79| M: He's [in [the] river .] 
A|80| A: Well _the puppy_ jumped [in the] , into some _of_ [the] pools _but_ [not] into [the] [, _I] was_ careful [to] keep her [away from] [the] , [the] fast moving [water] , 
B|81| M: Did [the puppy] jump [in [the] river] ? 
A|82| A: 'cause if she fell [in] _then_ I'd _of_ [been] , [had] [to] [go] [in] after her . _And_ up here [the] water's probably [about] forty degrees right now . 
B|83| M: Why [is] [it] [so] _wet_ ? 
A|84| A: _And_ [I] would [not] have [been] _fun_ trying [to] retrieve her _, but_ [, uh ,] [this [dog] ,] Dennis jumped [in] [and] [got] [this] look on [his] face [like] _what_ do [I] do now , as _he's_ floating down [the river] _then_ finally discovered [that] _he_ could swim [and] [, uh ,] actually paddled up against [the] current [and] [, uh ,] made [it] [back] [to] [the] shore [and] climbed up [and] _then_ , _he_ , _he_ jumped [in] again , [and] _he was_ swimming [for] quite [a] bit , all afternoon [. He] loved [it] . 
B|85| M:  
A|86| A: Cocoa _didn't_ [think] _too_ much _of it_ , though . _She_ jumped [in] [and] _then_ started screaming [and] made [me] pull her [back] out . [I] pulled her out [and] [, uh ,] _then_ [had] [to] wrap her up [in] [a] sweatshirt because she [was] shivering [so] bad , 
B|87| M: You 
A|88| A: [and] [so _,] but_ [, uh ,] she [got] over [it] _, so ._ 
B|89| M:  ... 
A|90| A: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: [She was] [so] ... 
A|92| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|93| M: Uhh ... _well [,_ you know] . 
A|94| A: [Yeah] , I've [, I] live right across [the] street [from] [a] [, a] big lake here , um [, it's] on Oneida lake [and] [I'm] wondering if [, uh ,] if she'll want [to] [go] out there [and] [go] swimming next [year .] _I mean_ , I've [got] , [the] yard's all fenced [in] [so] she doesn't run loose _, but_ [, uh ,] she could [go] [in] sometime when , if [I'm] watching her , 
B|95| M:  
A|96| A: _so ._ 
B|97| M: You _okay_ ? 
A|98| A: [Oh] really .

A|104| A: [Oh] really . 
B|105| M: [I] [know] . 
A|106| A: [Oh ,] [okay] , [my] [my] [dog ,] [last] German Shepherd [, it was] [a] real chore trying [to] give [him] [a] bath _too_ . _And_ [that] [was] [the] thing [I] couldn't figure out because _he_ would [go] [in the] lake [, it] wasn't [like] _he_ _didn't_ 
B|107| M: He's [not] _a [dog_ [,] he's] _a _dog_ ._ 
A|108| A: normally _, I mean_ _he_ _didn't_ seem [to] have [a] problem with getting [wet] _, but_ if [you] wanted [to] get [him] [wet] , forget [it] . 
B|109| M: Umm ... [he] 
A|110| A: [Yeah .] 
B|111| M: [I guess] [she's] [not too] fond [of it] [then] .
