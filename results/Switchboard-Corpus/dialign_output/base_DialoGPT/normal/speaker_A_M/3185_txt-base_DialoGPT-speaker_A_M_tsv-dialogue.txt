A|9| A: Are _you_ ? 
B|10| M: You're welcome 
A|11| A: _Well , I_ have _a_ friend who's [the] same way , _and_ [anything] below sixty , she's _just_ [not] happy _but I_ _, _I_ think_ [what] _I_ _would_ miss is [the] change _of_ seasons _and_ all _because_ _I know_ _in_ Plano we really _don't_ have as many seasons as , uh , _my_ husband's _from_ Nebraska , _and_ they have more _of_ [the] four seasons . 
B|12| M: [I] can't imagine why [you] _would be_ [so] _cold ._ 
A|13| A: _Oh ,_ you're _used to_ _that ,_ _too ._ 
B|14| M: [I'm] [from] [the] east coast , [I'm] [used to] _it _,_ but I_ [like]

B|16| M: Hmmm , here's 
A|17| A: It goes [from] _hot_ , _and_ then [you] get _a_ couple _of_ weeks _of_ _that_ Indian _Summer_ , _and_ then [it's] [cold] 
B|18| M: [I] [like _the] [weather_ .]

B|20| M: A few [months of] _it ._ 
A|21| A: _Well _, I_ don't_ either unless [it's] [like] , uh , some [of] _my_ favorite's [like] _a_ Friday night when [it] rains _and_ [you] really didn't have anywhere [to] go , _and_ [it's] sleeping [time] . But if [you] have [to] get up _and_ get _out_ _in_ [it _,] I _don't_ _like_ it_ either 
B|22| M: [I] hate [rain] . 
A|23| A: _Oh ,_ _yeah_ . _Well ,_ [sure] [it] does . That kind [of] schedule _, you_ really _need_ _a_ lot more sunshine . 
B|24| M: Why _do you_ want . _to ._ _to ._ _it ._ 
A|25| A: And also [the] evenings are [going to be] getting , uh , darker sooner as [it] gets cooler . 
B|26| M: [Well , I] love [it] 
A|27| A: But [I] did _a_ walk last night , _and_ [it] seemed _like it_ was _a_ little bit _hot_ still . Sometimes when [you] work up _a_ sweat [you] _need_ [it] [to be] _a_ little bit cooler . 
B|28| M: [Oh _,] it's_ [not] . [I'm] [not] [too] [sure] [about] [that [,] I don't] _think so_ . 
A|29| A: [Well , I] agree , absolutely , _and_ [you] [know] [, it's] all relative , _because_ [I] was [from] West Texas , _and_ [it] was very dry , _and_ [so] [I] thought Dallas was awful , _and_ [I] still [think so] [, but] then this summer we went [to] Orlando _for a_ week , _and_ [it] was [so] _humid_ [there] [that] your , um , all your windows were were wet every morning . They had [to] get [the] squeejies _and_ clean them off . 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: And when we got back [to] Dallas [it] seemed really dry _because_ [it's] kind [of] [like] [what] you're [used [to] .] But [I] agree with [you] , [the] humidity , especially [for] curly heads [like] me . 
B|32| M: [I] 
A|33| A: _Yes _._ I_ [do] [not] [like the] 
B|34| M: _It's_ [hot] [and] [humid] [and] [humid] . 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . 
B|36| M: No [, I] don t [like] [rain] . 
A|37| A: _Yeah [,_ _I] [think_ _so] too _._ _I_ know_ our grass needs mowing twice as often when [it] rains 
B|38| M: [I think] [it's] [because] they're sooo cute 
A|39| A: [but] [it] seems [like] _here_ [, I] [would] _like it_ [to] [rain] [and] then [be] over , [and] then [not] [rain] _for a while_ . It seems [like] when [it] gets stuck _in_ _a_ [rain] pattern , that's all [it] does . 
B|40| M: [I] [like] [rain] 
A|41| A: [So ,] uh [, but I] _, I am_ [ready _for] a_ little bit [of] [the] cooler [weather] [and] [not] [so] much _in the_ nineties [but] something [like] , 
B|42| M: [Well [, I] am] [going to be] [out] [of] town [for a] few _days_ . 
A|43| A: [I] guess _my_ , _my_ best [would be] probably sixty-eight when [you] wake up or sixty-six , [and] then probably seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|44| M: What _do you_ mean [, you] [think] [it's] [not] _a good_ [time] 
A|45| A: _Yeah . _Yeah_ ,_ are [you] , [do _you] [like_ the] heat _in the_ summer then when [it] gets up _in the_ nineties [and] hundreds . 
B|46| M: [I'm] [from] [the] nin'y's .

B|64| M: [Oh] _yeah [,_ [I] know] [. I] [just] [don't like [the] [weather] .] 
A|65| A: everybody seems [to be] [, you] can tell some [of] [the] newscasters when they [like the] heat , [because] they'll talk [about] [it] being [so] gorgeous on those [days] when we're melting , [and] [you] can tell when they talk [about] beautiful [weather] some mornings when we're , [it'll be] [too] [cold] , [and] they'll [say] , well those are [the] ones [that] [like the] [cold] [weather .]
