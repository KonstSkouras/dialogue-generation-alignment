B|4| M: _It's_ . 
A|5| A: My grandmother lived with us , _um ,_ until August , _um ,_ and we made _the_ decision _to_ put her _in_ _a_ nursing home . She has leukemia 
B|6| M: Thanks . gif 
A|7| A: and her , _the_ rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody _she_ trusted and knew _was_ _in_ Dayton , and were several thousand miles away 
B|8| M:  ... [um ,] how did [she] die ? 
A|9| A: _so_ _I_ made _the_ decision _to_ put her _in_ _a_ nursing home , and my sister being on _the_ other end found _one_ _that_ [she] could have what _was_ called an independent living facility . She _had_ her own little room and _didn't_ have _to_ share _it_ with anyone and could bring _in_ her own chair and T V set 
B|10| M: No 
A|11| A: _so ._ 
B|12| M: [I] don't _think_ [so .] 
A|13| A: Yes . _And_ _that_ , _the_ other major factor is _that_ [she] needs blood transfusions every week _to_ ten days , and would have _to be_ hospitalized _a_ day or two , [so] _in_ this facility they can do _it_ right there from her own room 
B|14| M: _It's_ fine 
A|15| A: [so] [she] _didn't_ have _to be_ transported back and forth . So _, she's_ been there since August _the_ thirteenth and seems _to_ have adjusted _pretty_ well . [It's] _not_ her favorite place _to be_ _in ._ She'd much rather _be_ here with _me ._ But when _it_ got _to_ _the_ point [I] _was_ spending more time at _the_ hospital with her , 
B|16| M:  
A|17| A: and I've got little children here who needed _me_ here [she] needed somebody _to_ watch her twenty-four hours _a_ day . 
B|18| M: She's [so] [she's] _just_ fine . 
A|19| A: So . She _was_ falling down and hemorrhaging and , you _know_ , all kinds of physical problems , [so] _it_ [just] became too much for _me_ _to_ handle , even though [I] would have liked _to_ have _had_ her stay , with her health being what _it was_ [she] couldn't anymore . 
B|20| M: _It_ 
A|21| A: Yeah . Uh-huh . Yeah . 
B|22| M: Weep . 
A|23| A: _Oh ._ 
B|24| M: He [had] [to] _get_ . [it was] . [in .] greee . [me .] up 
A|25| A: Yeah . 
B|26| M: [Oh .] That's unfortunate . 
A|27| A: Yes , well , [I] [think] sometimes when people [get] _to be_ _a_ certain age , other people have [to] kind of help them make decisions . [It] _sure_ wouldn't have been Granny's decision [to] leave us and go back [to] _a_ nursing home , but [she's] accepted [it] real well _now_ 
B|28| M: I'm [pretty] [sure] that's why _he_ left , _he_ [didn't] want [to be] [the] only [one] . 
A|29| A: [so .] 
B|30| M: _I know_ . 
A|31| A: Well , we enjoyed having her here , 
B|32| M: [she's] [not] [that] old [, she's] [a] year old [now] 
A|33| A: but we feel [she's] much safer where [she] is [now] . She still continues [to] fall , but when [she] does there , [a] nurse is right there [to] help her 
B|34| M: [And] [she's] very calm . 
A|35| A: and [I know] [she's] eating [the] right things , and her doctor's right there where [he] can come [in] and check on her , [so .] [It] became dangerous for us [to] keep transporting her back and forth [in] [the] car because [she] [was] [so] wobbly and needed [a] walker or [a] wheel chair 
B|36| M:  ... I'm [so] sorry . 
A|37| A: [so] , [I] [think] she'll adjust ,
