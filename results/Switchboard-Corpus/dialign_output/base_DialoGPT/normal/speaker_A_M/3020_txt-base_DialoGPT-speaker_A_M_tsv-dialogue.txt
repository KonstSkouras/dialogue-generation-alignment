B|4| M: _I'm_ sorry . 
A|5| A: _Uh ,_ _that_ _was_ _about_ _a_ _year_ _and_ _a_ half ago _, and_ , 
B|6| M: _I _have_ been_ [in Morocco] [and] _there_ _was _a_ lot _of_ people_ _there_ . 
A|7| A: _Uh ,_ well my husband _is_ French [and] [we] were living [in] France _at_ _the_ time 
B|8| M: _I'm_ sorry _, what_ ? 
A|9| A: [and] [we] decided _that_ [I] , I've never _been to_ Africa _and I_ needed _to_ get _that_ continent since [I] hadn't [been] [there] yet . And _it_ _, it's_ , actually _it's_ [a] fairly common vacation _place_ for French [people] _to_ _go_ [and] _they_ speak French [and] , _so_ , _uh_ _, you_ _know_ , [in] _that_ sense _is_ just _a little bit_ easier 
B|10| M: Uhm ... 
A|11| A: [and] _it_ just seemed _like it_ _would_ _be_ [a] _fun_ _place_ _to_ _go_ . And , _So_ [we] , [we] didn't _really_ [have] enough time . 
B|12| M: Uhhh

A|25| A: Uh-huh 
B|26| M: We're _all_ _in a_ club ... uhuh 
A|27| A: Yeah . It [was a] very interesting vacation . _The_ _only_ thing [I] didn't _like_ _was in_ _some_ [of] [the] more touristy areas [uh] , um , [the] _, it_ _would_ just _be_ besieged by [people] wanting _to_ _be_ your guide 
B|28| M: [No ,] _not_ _you ._ 
A|29| A: [and] [you] _, there_ were _some places_ , _where_ [people] , 
B|30| M: Uhhh [, there] [was] [some [places] .] 
A|31| A: [there] _would_ _be_ kids [there] _that_ were excellent _at_ ripping [you] off , 
B|32| M: [Oh] _yeah_ . 
A|33| A: [and] [we] had nothing taken because [we] knew [and] [we] had things [in] inside pockets [and] [in] _, you_ _know_ , [in] jacket underneath [a] coat type [of] thing . 
B|34| M: _I was_ [there] [, you] can _see_ [me] . 
A|35| A: _But_ , 
B|36| M: _it was_ _all_ [a] lie 
A|37| A: Uh-huh . 
B|38| M: What _is the_ joke ? 
A|39| A: Yeah . 
B|40| M: _It's a_ shame [they] [don't] _have a_ better _way to_ spend money . 
A|41| A: _The_ , [the] worst _place_ _was in_ Marrakech 
B|42| M: _I'm_ sorry _, I'm_ _not_ sure [what] [you] mean . 
A|43| A: [and] [the] other cities [it] wasn't nearly as _bad_ [and] [a] couple [of] them [it was] [, what] [we] _did_ [in] [some] [of] [the] other cities [and] [they] tell [you] [to] _do that_ [is] [to] hire [a] local guide 
B|44| M: Well _, I'm a_ guy .

A|61| A: _Uh ,_ [we're] going [to] _go_ for [a] conference _in September_ [and] [so] , hopefully , we'll get [to] travel _a little bit_ too . 
B|62| M: _I think_ [you] are [the] [only] [one] . 
A|63| A: _Uh ,_ my more exciting spots [have been] , I've [been _to] the_ Galapagos Islands . 
B|64| M: u TheLolzLizard u thel 0n 
A|65| A: Uh-huh , [that] [was] [one] [of] [the] most wonderful vacations I've ever had . 
B|66| M: We'll [be] [there [in] September] _, I think_ . 
A|67| A: Yes . If _you like_ wildlife _, it's_ [a] fabulous vacation . 
B|68| M: _I'm_ glad [you [like] _it] ._ 
A|69| A: If [you] [don't] [like] wildlife [it's] probably [not] [of] interest [But] [it] , [that] [was] _really_ , _really_ fabulous [and] just [the] photos [I have] [of] [it] [and] gosh , incredible [and] [be] [so] close , 
B|70| M: _I'm [a_ little bit] jealous . 
A|71| A: Um , August , eighty-eight . 
B|72| M: What [year] ? 
A|73| A: And _then_ , actually , after [there] _I went to_ um , _Hawaii_ , [a lot of] my travel has [been] sort [of] based around conferences or business meetings 
B|74| M: _It's_ [in September] . 
A|75| A: [and] [so] [, _I] went _to_ Hawaii_ _and then_ [to] _Australia_ [and] _Japan_ [and] _China_ , 
B|76| M: [I went [to] the] same [place] [, [and] then] [went _to] a_ different [place] _, but_ [then] [went] back [to Hawaii] . 
A|77| A: [I] [, I] , actually [I] didn't _go_ diving . 
B|78| M: ohhh _yeah_ . 
A|79| A: [I] [, I'm _a] diver_ [and] [so] , that's , that's actually [been] another [of] my favorite vacations has [been] taking [little] diving trips 
B|80| M: [Uh [,] I'm] [not] [a diver] . 
A|81| A: [but] , [uh] _, no_ [I] didn't get [to the] Great Barrier Reef . [I] drove from Sidney down [to] Melbourne [and] over [to] Adelaide . 
B|82| M: Did [you] [go] [to the] great barrier reef ? 
A|83| A: [It's] gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . _The_ coastline [was] just incredible _. It's_ huge . 
B|84| M: Hmmm _, I think_ [I] [might] _go there_ . 
A|85| A: _Australia ._ Yeah . 
B|86| M: You mean [the] great barrier reef ? 
A|87| A: [Uh [,] but] , 
B|88| M: [The] coast [of] [Australia .] 
A|89| A: [I] [don't] remember if [I] had _shrimp_ . 
B|90| M: You [don't] [have] [shrimp] ? 
A|91| A: [I] [don't] [think] [so] . 
B|92| M: [I'm] [in] [Australia .] 
A|93| A: [Oh] [, I] [like] [that] too . [But] , [uh] , [in] fact [I] didn't eat out [that] _much_ [there] because [I was] traveling by myself [in a] car _, it_ [would] [have been] [, I think] , _much_ more _fun_ [to] [do] [it] [like] [in the] van , with [a] bunch [of people] . 
B|94| M: That's [not] [really] how [it] works . 
A|95| A: [But] , [uh] , 
B|96| M: [No [,] no] [, it's] [not] [that] [fun] . 
A|97| A: Uh-huh . 
B|98| M: You're adventurous . 
A|99| A: And [I was] by myself _in China_ too . 
B|100| M: [I [was] [in] China] 
A|101| A: Yeah . 
B|102| M: [I'm] [not] seeing [you] 
A|103| A: [China] [was [a] little bit] more , [uh] , [of] [a] challenge . [But] _, it_ _, it_ wasn't more [of] [a] challenge [in a] sense because [I] hired [a] guide [all] [the] time , 
B|104| M: That's [not] [a] [bad] idea . 
A|105| A: [and] [so] [I] never [, you] [know] , got out by myself , or [not] _much_ , 
B|106| M: [Oh] . [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|107| A: [No ,] actually [I] paid _about_ either [a] thousand dollars or [a little bit] [, no] maybe [it was] _about_ [a] thousand dollars , maybe [a little bit] less [, I] [don't] [really] remember , for ten days including [all] my meals , [a] guide , [a] car , [the] airfare [and] [, but] [this] [is] from _Hong Kong_ , 
B|108| M: [Hong Kong] 
A|109| A: because [I was] already [in] [Hong Kong] [and] , um [, but] [it] [only] cost [you] _about_ [a] thousand dollars [to] [go there] _and [I_ went to] Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu [and] actually [then] [I] took [a] train up from Shanghai [to [a] little] , Quingdao [I think] [is the] name [of] [it _.] [It's_ [a] little] , [uh] , sort [of] getaway retreat village [not] far from Shanghai _. It's_ just [a] train ride . 
B|110| M:  
A|111| A: And [that] [, I] had two internal , [one] , [yeah] , two internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other things . It [was] [really] , 
B|112| M: [you .] 
A|113| A: Uh-huh . 
B|114| M:  ... [and] [what] [about] how [do] [you] ? 
A|115| A: Around [a] thousand . 
B|116| M: [I'm] sorry , how [much] [did you] make ? 
A|117| A: [Oh] , Japan's ridiculous . 
B|118| M: There are [some places] [where] [it's] [not] [that] expensive [, [and] I] live [in] [Japan] . 
A|119| A: And _I stayed_ [, I] didn't stay [in the] top [of] [the] line hotels [but] _I stayed in_ , [they] were [all] completely clean , 
B|120| M: [I stayed in] [Japan] [, [it] was] [like] [this] 
A|121| A: [and] [, you] [know] , [they] were newly built [and] [they] were sort [of] [the] lower end [of] [the] top [of] [the] line , hotels , because [they] said [you] can't stay [in the] cheap stuff . 
B|122| M: They're [not] even [that] expensive 
A|123| A: Right . Right . 
B|124| M: Yup [. It's] [all] [about] [the] money 
A|125| A: [Uh [,] but] [yeah] , [that] [was] [, I] highly recommend [that] [way to] [go] . If [you're] ever interested [in] going [the] route [, I] dealt with [this] woman , her name [was] Rita [at] [China] Tours [in] Boston 
B|126| M: [China] 
A|127| A: Yeah . [Uh [,] and] [a] friend [of] mine who had gone for [a] business trip [to] [China] [and] she just gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and] [it] [would] [really] [be] [fun] [, I think] ideally with [like] two couples because [you have a] car [and] [a] driver [and] [a] guide 
B|128| M: Can [you] [do that] ? 
A|129| A: [and then] ,
