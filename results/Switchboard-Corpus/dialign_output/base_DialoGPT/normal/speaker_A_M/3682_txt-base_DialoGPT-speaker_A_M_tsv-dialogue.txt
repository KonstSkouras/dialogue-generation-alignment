A|54| A: _Oh _,_ _you_ do_ , okay , [yeah] . [I] [have a] _really_ easy recipe _for that_ , where [you] [just] brown [the] _chicken_ _and then you_ put _rice_ _in_ [the] bottom [of] _the pan_ _, you_ pour bouillon or _chicken_ broth over [it] 
B|55| M: Ah [. Well [,] [I] don't] [really] [like [it] .]

B|57| M: [You] _can't_ just'put'the [chicken] into [the pan] _. You_ [have] to'put [it] in'it ' . 
A|58| A: [Yeah ,] over uncooked _rice_ 
B|59| M: [You] mean [rice] ? 
A|60| A: [and] [you can] either _microwave it_ or _do it_ _in_ [the] oven [, and] [it] [just] . 
B|61| M: [And] [you can] [microwave it] 
A|62| A: It fluffs up [, and] [it's] [really] moist . 
B|63| M: _I've_ never seen [it] [like that] _before_ . How [is] [it ?] 
A|64| A: Uh-huh , wow , [yeah] . 
B|65| M: i _think it's_ _just a_ weird coincidence . 
A|66| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: [Yeah .] 
A|68| A: [Well ,] _I'll_ keep [that] one _in_ mind . 
B|69| M: You'll _get_ [the] same result [when] [you] _cook_ [it .] 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| M: [You] mean [to] say ... 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] 
B|73| M:  ... [I don't] _know_ ... 
A|74| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah _,] [you_ can] _get away_ _with_ [it] even [having a] semi nice dinner , 
B|75| M: [I don't] _know_ . 
A|76| A: or _, you_ [know] semi . 
B|77| M: [I] mean [you] _can't_ [really] [do] [that] [with] [a] spoon 
A|78| A: [Yeah .] 
B|79| M: [I] mean , [if you] wanted [to] [, I] could [get away] from [it .] 
A|80| A: [Yeah [.] You] put _in_ , um 
B|81| M: _But_ ... [I don't] [have] any . 
A|82| A: let's _see_ , [what] [was] [it] , three quarters [of] _cup _of_ rice_ or , 
B|83| M: _I think_ [so] . Let's [see] 
A|84| A: It depends on _, [you_ can] [really] vary [it .] 
B|85| M: [I] dont _know ,_ how many _cups_ [of rice] ? 
A|86| A: [But] [you] _have to_ put [the] _water in_ proportionally . [I] [can't] remember . [I think] [it] [was] three quarters _cup_ [rice] [to] two [cups] _water_ , two [cups] , um , broth . 
B|87| M: [I don't] [think] _I've_ ever had [a] [cup of] [water in] [a] bath . 
A|88| A: [Yeah ,] flavor . Uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|89| M: [I] mean [, you] [can't] really'use'it [for [that] .] 
A|90| A: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: Mmmmmm , taste . 
A|92| A: Um , let's [see] . [I think] [it] [was] an hour . [I've] [done] [it] [in] [the] [microwave] [so] often lately because [, it's] [, it's] [really] easy . 
B|93| M: [Oh [,] I] [know] . [It's] _a little_ ... spicy . 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] [But] [, [I] [think] it's] [about] an hour . 
B|95| M: [So] [you do] [the] same thing [, and then you] [microwave [it] ?] 
A|96| A: Or maybe [it's] only half hour . Um [, you] [just] , until [the] [rice] looks fluffy [, and] [and] _not_ overdone [. You] [know ,] [before] [it] gets overdone . 
B|97| M: That's [a] great [idea .] [I'll] [do it] 
A|98| A: [Yeah .] 
B|99| M: [I] mean [, it's] [just] [chicken] . 
A|100| A: Um , I'd let [it] [cook] [just [a] little bit] [just] [so] [that] _the cooking_ goes [a little] faster . 
B|101| M: [Yeah ,] [I'm] gonna [have to] [do] [that .] 
A|102| A: [Yeah , I] liked your [idea] [too] , there . 
B|103| M: Yea . [I'll] [have to] [see] [what] [I] [can] [do] . [It's] [a] [bit] hard [to make] [the cooking] go [a little] quicker 
A|104| A: Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [But] ... [it's] [not] [a] soup . 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: Ummm ... How [do] [you] [make] soup ? 
A|108| A: Uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [It's] [a] thing
