A|23| A: _Right_ _, and_ people [don't] see [that] either . 
B|24| M: _I'm not_ _sure_ . 
A|25| A: _Right ._ _The_ _only one_ [that] _we _,_ we_ [have] [that] _we_ kept was _the_ Discover card , 
B|26| M: [Right .] 
A|27| A: _and_ [it] pays [you] [to] use [it] . [I] mean , if [you] _pay_ your bill off right away , if [you] [don't] ever [have to] _pay_ [any] interest [on] [it] because _they_ give [you] [a] certain amount every time [that] [you] use [it] , 
B|28| M: _Yes_ . 
A|29| A: _and_ [you] make [that] money as long as [you] [don't] ever [have to] _pay_ them [any] _, uh ,_ interest .

B|30| M: lol 
A|31| A: that's going [to] take up what [you] would [have] made . 
B|32| M: no .

B|34| M: uuh [, uh [,] charge] _, they_ [pay] [, charge] 
A|35| A: Yeah . 
B|36| M: [Oh ,] _so_ [you're] saying [that] [it's] [a] service [charge] ? 
A|37| A: [Right .] They [don't have] _one_ [of those .] So , [it] _, we_ decided [that] was [it] _, you_ know _, and_ _, I_ mean , everybody calls us _and_ wants [to] give us [a] credit card . We [have] _, we_ could [have] credit cards running down our ears . 
B|38| M: It's [not] [like] [you [have] a] creditcard . 
A|39| A: [Yes] , yes . And then , [I'll have] , just [like] [, uh ,] department stores . They'll call me up _, you_ know _, and_ [I'll] _say ,_ look _, [I_ don't] want _the_ credit card , well , we're just going [to] send [it] [to] _you _,_ you_ know _, you_ [don't [have] to] ever use [it] if [you] [don't] want [to] .

B|40| M: [I] 
A|41| A: Uh-huh . Yeah . 
B|42| M:  
A|43| A: [I] know [it] _, and_ [you] know what ... 
B|44| M: [you] [can't] , a' , [say [,] and] do . 
A|45| A: What's [really] bad [about] [those] though [is] just [like] young people if [they] [don't] _, you_ know _, we_ take _the_ time [to] _, you_ know , help my daughter , she's in college , 
B|46| M: [The] [worst] part [is] [, we] [don't] 
A|47| A: [but] [it] [, this is] her first credit card thing , well , when she _got_ her first _one_ she was [so] excited [it] was unreal . Look _at_ [this] [they] sent me [this] money _, you_ know . So then when [I] explained [to] her , look [you [have] to] [pay] [this] [back] [and] [they] are going [to] [charge] [you] interest [, and] stuff , [of] course , she tore [it] up . But [a] lot [of] parents would [not] take _the_ time _, you_ know [, and] [they] wouldn't even think [of] [it] or their kids may [not] [be] as close as my daughter [and] [I] are [, and] [, uh _,] you_ know [, they] may [not] even discuss [it] [, they] go out [and] cash their check thinking [that _,] you_ know , they've _got_ something , maybe they've won something . [You] know , somebody sent them something [free] . 
B|48| M:  
A|49| A: And go out [and] spend [it] . And , um , [it's] just unreal . [I] mean _, [I_ don't] [like] credit cards _, I_ wish [that] [they] would come up with some other way [to] _, you_ know , _the only_ way [you] could use them [is] if [you] were , [like] [on] vacation . They would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] year . [You] know _, I_ mean , [of] course _, I_ guess some people go out [and] spend their whole entire limit [on] [it] [like] [that] _at_ [that] time [but] , um _, [I_ have] seen [so] many people [and] _I have a_ friend right [now] she just _got_ off [of] thirteen . She _got_ [, uh _,] I_ [can't] remember what she called [it] , [it's] some kind [of] , maybe [it's] [sure] or something [like] [that ,] [it's] something , [it's] some weird name [of] [a] credit card , 
B|50| M: Who 
A|51| A: [and] she [is] charging out [of] her mind already . And [I'm] going _, you_ just _got_ off . That's how [you] _got_ [on] [to] [it] [to] start with _, you_ know , what _is the_ matter with [this] person , 
B|52| M: What 
A|53| A: But , um , [it] seems [like] people just _, you_ know [, they] just think , well _, I_ can just [have] anything [I] want . And [I] just [don't] see [it] [like] [that] . Of course _, I_ always see [pay] _the_ bills first [and] whatever's leftover , that's what [you have] [, but] , um , maybe [a] lot [of] people [don't] see [it] [like] [that , but] [I] [can't] stand owing . [I] mean _, I_ cannot fully tolerate [to] owe something [like] _, you_ know _, I_ guess [it's] just because I've _been_ brought up [like] [that] . But , um _, I_ could [not] [charge] [to] _the_ limit [and] knowing _that I_ was going [to] [have to] [pay] [this] thing out [for] ever [and] maybe suffer from having [to] payout . But , that's just _the_ way [I] feel [about it] . 
B|54| M:  ! 
A|55| A: [Right .] yeah . 
B|56| M: [this] . [that] 
A|57| A: oh , yeah . [I] guess [it] [is] [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] more [and] more people are [like] [that] . But , um _, I_ guess [it's] because [I'm] older _, I_ mean , [I'm not] real old [but] [I] am older [and] , um _, you_ know _, I_ didn't feel [like] _that I_ didn't feel [like] [I] had [to] [have] everything . [I] guess [it] was because , well _, I_ had everything when [I] was _at_ home [but] _I , [I_ don't] know why [I] didn't . 
B|58| M:  
A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [I] 
A|61| A: yeah . 
B|62| M: [we ,] 
A|63| A: Huh . 
B|64| M: [that] [is the] joke 
A|65| A: Yeah , well , [it] didn't hurt _you ,_ did [it] , [to] _, I_ mean _, you_ didn't go out [and] [charge] [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything , did [you] ? 
B|66| M: [I have a] feeling [that] [I'm not] [the [only] one] who's mad [at] [the] fact [that I] [got] [a] new phone [and] [it's] [been] 4 years . 
A|67| A: Yeah , well _, you_ learned then , right ?
