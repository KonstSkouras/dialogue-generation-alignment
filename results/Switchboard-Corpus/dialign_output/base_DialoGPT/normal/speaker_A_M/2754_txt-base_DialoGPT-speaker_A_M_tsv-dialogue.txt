[I'm not] even _sure_ [of] _that _,_ but_ _for_ _some_ reason [I think] _that _,_ you know ,_ [it] _was_ something [like] [that] .

B|30| M:  ... 
A|31| A: _Yeah _,_ but_ _, you_ _, you_ [think] _that _,_ _I_ mean_ _if_ [you] [think] [of] _how many_ premeditated murders _are_ committed _, you know ,_ compared _to_ [that] [and] _to_ _how many_ people _are_ [being] sent , [that] _doesn't_ seem [like] very _many_ .

A|33| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|34| M: [that] ,. 
A|35| A: Everyone _would_ _appeal ._ [That's] true , too . 
B|36| M: Except [, you know ,] [the] [, uh ,] appeals 
A|37| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [I think] [it would be] [a] good idea [to] [have] [the] Supreme Courts review [the cases] _of the_ Supreme courts [and] [the] Supreme court [of] appeals . 
A|39| A: Uh-huh _. Yeah ._ 
B|40| M: Not [really] , [the] supreme court [doesn't] [appeal] [the] [appeal .] 
A|41| A: _Yeah ,_ uh-huh . 
B|42| M: Um , um , um ... 
A|43| A: And then _they_ _get out ._ 
B|44| M: The [first] thing [I] thought [of] [was] [that they] [are] _in the_ middle [of] [a] street . 
A|45| A: _Yeah _,_ they_ _get out_ [in] _three years_ on probation , 
B|46| M: [I] wonder [how many] [of them] [are] _going to_ _be in jail_ [for] [the] next [three years] . 
A|47| A: [and] [they] _do it_ again [, you know] . 
B|48| M: _They_ [get out] 
A|49| A: [It's] [like] [a] slap on [the] fingers _for them ._ 
B|50| M: Why ? 
A|51| A: [I don't] _, [I_ don't] _, [I_ don't] _, [I_ think] [that] [it] should [be] _, _I_ mean_ _if_ _it's_ beyond [a] doubt [that] someone did premeditate someone _, a_ murder , then [I think] [, you know ,] [that they] should likewise [, you know ,] someone should take their life also . [But] [, uh _,] but_ , [are] , [are] [you] , [would] [you] draw [the] line there with just [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|54| M: _Oh _,_ so_ ? 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . 
B|56| M: [I'm] sorry [, I'm] sorry . 
A|57| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|58| M: [Well [,] it's] [a] lot easier [to] [get] [in] prison _than_ [it] [is] [to] [get out .] 
A|59| A: Uh-huh _. Yeah ._ 
B|60| M: Yea [. Yeah .] 
A|61| A: [I think] _some [of_ them] [would] rather [be in jail] 
B|62| M: [So] [you're] [saying] [that] [some _of] the_ guys [in] prison [are] [like] [the] inmates ? 
A|63| A: [Yeah .] [They] _probably_ [have] [it] better [in jail] [than] [what] [they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: _You [know ,_ they] [probably] [don't] _have a_ lot [of] _money_ . 
A|65| A: [I don't] [know [,] uh _,] I_ [was] just [going to] [say] something _, I_ forgot [what] [it] [was] . [Oh _,] [I_ don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] now . 
B|66| M: What's your [point] ? 
A|67| A: In Clarion . [Well _,] _I_ live_ [in] Butler _, but_ [I'm] at [I'm] at college . [I'm] at Clarion University . 
B|68| M: Where [do you] [go] [to] school ? 
A|69| A: [Yeah] 
B|70| M: [Yeah [,] I'm not] [really] [sure] [what] [that] means . 
A|71| A: Uh-huh . See _, _yeah_ ,_ okay , well , see [, I'm] [, I'm] [in] kind [, I'm] [in] kind , okay [, uh ,] _we_ only [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|72| M: [I ,] er , _say ,_ mostly , 
A|73| A: [Yeah [,] and] [that] [would be] pushing _it ._ [So] _, _I_ mean_ this [is] definitely [a] college town . Uh , we're [about] two hours north [of] Pittsburgh _if_ [that] [would] help [you] [out] any . Uh , 
B|74| M: Uuh . 
A|75| A: North [of] Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . 
B|76| M: [I mean [,] what] state ? 
A|77| A: _Oh , I've_ never _heard of_ _Polk_ _but_ , 
B|78| M: [Polk] , PA . 
A|79| A: [Oh _,] I_ never _heard of_ [that] . 
B|80| M: [I think] [it's] [Polk] Institute [of] Technology 
A|81| A: It might [have a] new name . 
B|82| M: [Oh , I've] [heard of] [it .] 
A|83| A: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
B|84| M: [Oh [,] I'm] sorry [, I] thought [you] were [in the] Midwest 
A|85| A: We're [probably] [about] an hour _away from_ Sharon . 
B|86| M: [That's] pretty far [away from] where [I live] . 
A|87| A: Uh-huh . Uh [, so] [, [I] ,] most [of the] kids here [, [I] [,] you know ,] [like] [, you know ,] just [from] dorm mates [and] stuff , they'll [say [that] _they] don't_ believe [in] _it , but_ then after [I] [would] [say] my [point] [of] view , then they'll [say ,] well _, _yeah_ [,_ you know [,] you know] . 
B|88| M: Hehehe [, yeah .] 
A|89| A: [Yeah .] [You know [,] [I] think] people [can] [be] persuaded one way [or] another . [I've] never seriously ran into someone [, [I] mean] [like] , other [than] my priest [, you know ,] who definitely says [you] can't take [a] [, you know [,] you] can't take anyone's life . Uh , anyone [that] [is] [like] [so] against [it] [that] [you] couldn't persuade [them] [in] any instance . 
B|90| M: [I] 
A|91| A: Uh-huh . 
B|92| M:  . 
A|93| A: [yeah] Uh-huh . 
B|94| M: [Yeah [,] you] . 
A|95| A: [Yeah ,] 
B|96| M: [yeah [,] I'm] . 
A|97| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh [. Yeah .] [That's] something [, you know] _but_ [, uh ,] whether [they] plea bargain [or] [not] , _if_ _they're_ guilty [of] murder _, they're_ guilty [of] murder [, you know] . 
B|98| M:  ... 
A|99| A: [So] [I don't think] [that they] deserve [anything] _less_ 
B|100| M: [Well [,] [they] don't] [have a] lot [less] [than] [they [have] a] ton [of] [, they're] [a] ton's [a] ton [, a] ton 
A|101| A: [It's] just [, [I] don't] [, [I] don't] [know [,] I] just 
B|102| M: [I don't] [like you] 
A|103| A: Uh-huh [, and] [that] costs [money] [, yeah .] 
B|104| M: They're [not] getting [anything] [for them .] 
A|105| A: Uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [I'm not sure] [if you're] [saying] [we] [can] [do [it] , but] [we] [can]
