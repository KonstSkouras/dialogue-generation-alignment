A|1| A: So , _it_ _really_ _is_ _a_ different , um , 
B|2| M:  . 
A|3| A: _Yeah ,_ _that's_ , _that's_ _right_ talk _to_ _, I_ had _to_ talk _about_ _gun_ control with somebody _and_ _I_ talked with _a_ woman who actually , _you know_ , had _just_ _purchased_ _a_ _gun_ [that] day , _and_ _was_ going target shooting , _you know_ , 
B|4| M: [I] , [gun] , [gun] . 
A|5| A: _and_ _it was_ very different _it was_ _a_ whole , different view _. It's_ _really_ , um , this has opened _my_ eyes _to_ _thinking_ , _you know_ , at one _time I_ _just_ sat here _and_ _thought_ , well , _how_ can anybody believe [that] because I'd _really_ _never_ met people [that] _did_ , _and_ now _, I_ talk _to_ people [that] _do_ .

B|6| M: i' 
A|7| A: Uh-huh . 
B|8| M: _That's_ . 
A|9| A: Uh-huh . 
B|10| M: Hey . 
A|11| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|12| M: [It's] pretty cool . 
A|13| A: _Yeah ,_ isn't _it_ funny . 
B|14| M: Oh [, I] _see_ _. _I_ guess I_ [was] [thinking] _of the_ U . S . 
A|15| A: Uh-huh . 
B|16| M: _And_ _I'm_ not sure _if_ [you] _are_ aware _of the_ fact _that _they_ didn't_ allow _it ._ 
A|17| A: _Uh ._ _Yeah_ . 
B|18| M: What [about] _the_ fact _that they_ [never] [did] away ? 
A|19| A: _Yeah_ well [you] can possess 'em here too _but_ They _have _to_ be_ they're registered _and_ _Uh_ , like _uh_ [the] [the] Brady Bill _that's_ currently _being_ discussed nationally _and_ whatever _is_ very well supported here , _in_ [gun] control avenues , 
B|20| M: [I] [thought] [it was] [just] [the] federal _government_ [that] _allowed_ guns [to be] [purchased] [and] sold _in the_ state _of_ Florida . 
A|21| A: _You_ _have_ [the] seven day waiting period . 
B|22| M: Do [you know] [how] _much_ [time I] [have to] wait [to] buy [my] guns ? 
A|23| A: _Yeah_ 
B|24| M: Uhh _uh uh_ _huh_ 
A|25| A: _that's_ [uh] _that's_ 
B|26| M: _I'm_ not sure . 
A|27| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|28| M: _That's_ [the] N 
A|29| A: _Yeah that's_ true _that's_ very true [That's] [and] _that's the_ way [I guess] most [of the] um [the] _political_ organizations work [you know] _the same_ _I know_ [the] abortion issue with _right_ [to] life [and] _right_ [to] choose 
B|30| M: [It's] _all_ good . The [political] issues _are_ far _from_ [being] [a] bad _thing_ . 
A|31| A: [and] [and] both [of] _them_ [are] both want [the] extent [of] extremes so [that they] _don't_ give anything for [a] balance [you know] there's there's always [that] difficulty 
B|32| M: _And _I_ think that's_ fair enough . 
A|33| A: Um [I] would say [I'm] probably _liberal_ yeah 
B|34| M: [I'm] not sure _if_ you're [liberal] _or_ not _, but_ [you] _have a_ _point_ 
A|35| A: yeah Sure 
B|36| M: [You] _don't think_ [I'm] [liberal] ? 
A|37| A: _Well_ I'll tell [you] [. I] [I think] [you know] [if] [they] [if] [they didn't] give as [much] coverage [to] these idiots [that] burn _the flag_ , [it] would [never] happen _do [you_ _know] what_ [I] _mean_ ? 
B|38| M: How [do _you] _think_ the_ US [is] gonna treat [them] ? 
A|39| A: [It's] only because [they] make [a] big stink over [it .] But [I] [I guess] actually [I] believe [that] [if] somebody wants [to] burn _the flag_ [I guess] [that's] their opportunity They're they're they're _right_ [in the] sense [of] freedom [of] speech But [I] would [never] 
B|40| M: [You] _think that's_ wrong ? 
A|41| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|42| M: _And_ [if] you're not [the] owner [of [the] flag] _then_ you're wrong . 
A|43| A: _Yeah_ . _Well_ _it's_ [that they] [I [think] the] idea [of] freedom [of] speech goes back [to] [and] [I] [uh uh] [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] [being] able [to] display _your_ [uh] _your_ ideas [you know] [the] _what_ [the] _country_ stands on _America_ stands on [is] [that they] can [do] [that] _Uh_ , though [I] would [never] even consider [it] [in] [a] million years [to] [do] [it] myself [I] [I] [I think] [uh] [you know] [but] [I] [I] still _what_ [the flag] stands for [I guess] [to] me [is] [that] [if] somebody wants [to] voice their opinion [or] display their opinion openly [and] [if] [that] [is] [a] [a] way [that they] can show their opinion [then] [they] should [be] [allowed] [uh] 
B|44| M:  
A|45| A: Unless [the] burn unless [the] actual fire hinders somebody's health [and] well-being [you know] [but] [I] [I think that's] [I guess] [that's] [I] [that's] [my] opinion _Yeah_ [I guess] [you] feel differently . 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: _Uh_ _, no_ [but] [I think that's] [that's] [uh] _it's_ [that's] taxpayer's money . If somebody buys their own [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] [that's] fine [but] [that] [that's] [you know] [that's] destruction [and] [of] [uh] public property [and] whatever . 
B|48| M: [I] _have a_ bit , I' 
A|49| A: No _I don't_ [know] [I guess] [the] symbolism oh [I think] _what_ _America_ stands for [is] [the] _right_ [to be] able [to] disagree with [the] [government] . 
B|50| M: [America] 
A|51| A: _Uh_ [I think that's] what's made democracy 
B|52| M: [Yeah [that's] _the] thing_ 
A|53| A: [Yeah] . Uh-huh . [Yeah] . _Well_ [that's] [that's] true 
B|54| M: [It's] [the same] reason [you] can't _agree_ [to] [a] [political] _protest_ [. _It's] _a_ right_ . 
A|55| A: [Yeah] But [I think] [I] [I] [Yeah] [I] [I] [I guess] [the] idea [you know] [they] always keep saying like [the] framers . Um . there [uh] one [of the] Republican [the] appointees for [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] always talk [about] [they] feel [that] this person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution _what_ [the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set down . 
B|56| M:  
A|57| A: [And] Um [I] believe [that] [the] idea [of] burning [the flag] [is] [is] [in] 
B|58| M: Umm _. [Uh_ .] 
A|59| A: [my] understanding [of] [how] [it was] framed [is] [that] [you] this [the thing] [about] this _country_ [is] [that] [you] can disagree with its [government] [and] [you] can display _that ._ 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: [Uh] [, I] _Yeah [,_ I] [and] [and] so [that] as [a] freedom [of] expression [and] speech [and] whatever [I] [I think] [that] [that's] viable . Um as long as _it's_ _your_ [flag] [and] [and] you've made _your_ _your_ [point] [. [I] think] . [Yeah] Because , realistically , like for [you] for [you] [you] [don't think] _it's_ [right] 
B|62| M: What ? 
A|63| A: [And I] would [never] [do] [it [.] I] [I] love this _country_ too [much] , [and] [that] _symbol_ means [a] lot [to] me . 
B|64| M: [I] wouldn't 
A|65| A: Um . But [I guess] _it's_ [just] one [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] [that's] what's something _it's_ [a] need for [them] [you know] . 
B|66| M: [It's] ... [it's] 
A|67| A: [Yeah] . Yes . No . 
B|68| M: [You] [know what] i [mean] . 
A|69| A: Right . [Yeah] [. Uh] [huh] . 
B|70| M: [It's] not [a] [symbol] [of] [your] [country] [. _It's] a_ [symbol] . 
A|71| A: [Uh] [huh] . 
B|72| M: Uhhh _, uh_ , uhhh , uhh _, uh_ 
A|73| A: [Yeah] . 
B|74| M: [Well] [I'm] [a] boy scout . 
A|75| A: [I] [agree] there too [. I] [agree] with [you] there too [. I] [I] [the] um [I] [I] [it's] [I] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting But _I [don't_ think] [that] _I [don't_ think] [that] [uh] we [have [a] right] [to] stop somebody [from] [that] [you know] 
B|76| M: [Yeah [,] no] . 
A|77| A: [the same] _I don't_ [know] [I guess I] get [I] get [uh] [all] mixed up inside . when , [Yeah] 
B|78| M: [I don't] [really] [know what] [you] [mean] by [that .] 
A|79| A: [it] when [it's] [uh] [it's] an emotional issue , [and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] [about] [it] logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] say [to] yourself now emotionally this [is] [a] disgusting [thing] [, uh] [but] logically um even [you know] for instance , [the] pro life pro choice movement [, uh] [you know] [I don't] [know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [, but] [they] would vote pro choice . 
B|80| M:  
A|81| A: because [you know] [That's] [just] [a] disgusting [thing] [you know] somebody an abortion means [it's] somebody's [in] trouble [and] [that] [it's] an awful [thing] , [you know] 
B|82| M: [I know] 
A|83| A: [but] [Yeah] . [but] [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] [what] [I] [mean] , [see] [, but] [but] realistically when [you think] [of] [it] [it] [just] sounds like such an awful [thing] , [and] [it] evokes an emotional response [. [I] think [that's] the] hardest [thing] [, [I] don't] [know] [if] [I] could ever [be] [a] judge , because some things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|84| M:  
A|85| A: No [, no] [I [think] the] um sometimes [I guess] [what] [did] [I] read recently [the] um [the] [uh] Christian [uh] [point] [is] [is] always [the] [point] [of] well [it's] at conception [but] [then] um [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues with others [that] conception [is] [a] biblical term . [And] there's [no] concept [of] conception [in] medicine [or] biology . 
B|86| M: [I] ? 
A|87| A: so [then] [that] so [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion [then] . So [it's] [I don't] [know] [. It's] very [it's] [it's] [uh] [you know] [It's a] [it's] [a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] [really] something [how] um [political] ideas [and] viewpoints within one [country] can vary so [much] [and] also within um within [a] , 
B|88| M:  
A|89| A: [Yeah] [and] [how] [Yeah] [how] it'll sway [from] one one extreme [to] another . 
B|90| M:  
A|91| A: [Uh] [I think] [that] [uh] [you know] [I] [I] [just] read something [I think] [in] TIME magazine [uh] [about] um [protest]
