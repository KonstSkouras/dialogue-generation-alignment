A|1| A: Uh , 
B|2| M: _Oh_ _uh_ 
A|3| A: Uh-huh . Me too _. _I_ work_ _at_ _, uh ,_ _the_ Georgia Tech Research Institute . 
B|4| M: Uhh _, [I_ work] _in_ [the] Atlanta Public Library . 
A|5| A: Um _, [I'm_ a] co-op student _so_ [I work] _and_ go _to_ school about halftime . _And_ _, uh [,_ I] really _don't_ _have_ any job benefits _to_ speak of . We're kind of , um [, _I] don't know_ , _they_ _just_ kind of forget us on that end . We _don't_ really _have_ any vacation or , _you_ _know_ , sick days or health care or anything really _so_ . 
B|6| M: Uhhh _, I think_ we've all been _there_ . 
A|7| A: Exactly . Exactly . 
B|8| M: You're [a] . 
A|9| A: _What_ about _you_ ? 
B|10| M: [I] am [, uh [,] I'm] 
A|11| A: Huh . 
B|12| M: _Oh_ . O [. _I] think_ [they] [have] . 
A|13| A: Yeah . Uh , [they] do that [I think] if you're [, uh ,] research here then [I] _know_ of some of [the] people that [have] gotten their masters _and_ [I think] that , um , [they] might , _you_ _know_ , pay for that . Pay for [the] classes _and_ stuff 
B|14| M: _I have_ 
A|15| A: but [I] _know_ [they] let _you_ , they'll let _you_ decrease how many hours _you_ [work] by kind of percentage . _You_ _know_ , they'll let _you_ [work] halftime if _you_ want _to_ , if _you_ want _to_ finish , 
B|16| M: [You] 
A|17| A: _you_ want _to_ , Yeah . They'll let _you_ [work] , decrease your number of hours by any percentage _just ,_ _just_ about _so_ if _you_ want _to get_ your masters _and_ then [, I think] of course _you_ _get_ like [a] , with your extra degrees _you_ _get a_ pay raise due _so_ that will probably help out . 
B|18| M:  ... 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: It 
A|21| A: Yeah . Yeah [, I think] [, I] mean _that's_ _pretty_ , _that's a pretty_ important [, uh ,] part of it [there] because that , that can _be_ really expensive if _you_ ever [have] any health problems . My dad [, I think] my [, I'm] still covered on , with my dad's [, uh ,] health plan _at_ his , where he works , but it would definitely _be_ something _to_ look into once [I] _get_ my own . 
B|22| M: [I] [, I] , 
A|23| A: Uh-huh . 
B|24| M: [What] ?? 
A|25| A: [the] [I think] [the] [, _I] guess_ [the] only real , um , benefit _I guess_ _you_ could say working , for me working here , besides [I] mean [I'm] learning _and_ stuff because [, I'm] _at_ , _you_ _know_ , [in] school . 
B|26| M: [you] . 
A|27| A: But there's , there's some where [, uh [,] uh ,] student employees working for [the] government _don't_ [have] _to_ pay Social Security tax . _that's_ about , five percent right [there] 
B|28| M:  _, there_ . 
A|29| A: _so_ . 
B|30| M: [I guess] [I'm] [just [,] I'm] sooooooo good [at] being [a] person . 
A|31| A: That's about [the] only real bonus 
B|32| M: It's [a] free 2 . 5 
A|33| A: [I have] _, so_ [I have] _to_ take that into consideration when [I] evaluate like how much [I] _get_ paid [you] _know_ , because if [I] was working somewhere else I'd [have] _to_ , [you] _know_ , pay an extra five percent , or _so_ . 
B|34| M: It's [a] bit over 2 . 5 million [, so] [that's a pretty] good deal . 
A|35| A: Huh . Yeah . 
B|36| M: [And] [you] can't [be] poor [and] _not_ [have] [a] social security card . 
A|37| A: [Oh] , yeah ? 
B|38| M: [What] ? 
A|39| A: Uh-huh . Yeah . 
B|40| M: [I don't know] . 
A|41| A: help [a] lot . Yeah . See around , around here it's like [, uh ,] we [pretty] much [work] from project _to_ project on , well , [you] [know] , with different sponsors . 
B|42| M: What's [the] best way [to [get] a] new phone ? 
A|43| A: There's [not] [, there] is [not a] whole lot of , [you] [know] , funded research from ,
