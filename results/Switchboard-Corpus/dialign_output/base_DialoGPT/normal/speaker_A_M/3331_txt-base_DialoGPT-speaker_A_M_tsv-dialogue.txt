A|3| A: [You] _know ,_ _you_ _just_ , _you_ did [not] see _, I_ did [not] see anybody _in_ my classrooms , when _I was_ [going to school] , act up [the] way _that_ [kids] _do_ these days _in the_ classroom .

A|15| A: But [the] [school] system's afraid [of] getting sued [and [,] um ,] all sorts [of] lawsuits [I'm] sure because [of] things like [that] . 
B|16| M: We _are_ .

B|18| M: We [don't [,] that's] why .

B|20| M: It's [a] joke 
A|21| A: Yes supposedly [that's] _what_ it's suppose [to] go for [, and] _you know ,_ we'll _just_ _have_ [to] wait [and] see whether [that's] approved or [not] . 
B|22| M:  ... 
A|23| A: [You] [know _,] I_ [don't] [know] your feelings toward [that] _. I_ guess we shouldn't get into [that] but [, um [,] and] _what_ else [, um _,] I_ _think_ _in_ some ways [that they] need [to] be more careful [of] [the teachers] [that they] hire . 
B|24| M: It's 
A|25| A: _I have_ heard stories [, uh ,] from other [parents] [that] [I know] [of] , their children [are] _in_ _high school_ [that] [teachers] [are] out there giving drugs [and] selling drugs , 
B|26| M: What 
A|27| A: Oh [, yeah ,] 
B|28| M: That's [right .] 
A|29| A: I've , I've heard some horrible , horrible stories about _high_ , _high school_ [teachers] 
B|30| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|31| A: [and ,] _you know ,_ [to] be , be more careful [of] [the teachers] [that] we place _in_ our [school] . 
B|32| M: That's why [I] keep [a] [high school] teacher's number . 
A|33| A: Um [, that's] basically about all [that] [I know] [that] may be wrong with [the] [school] system _. I_ _think_ , with _what_ [they] _have_ [to] work with _, I_ _think_ they're doing [a] pretty good job [right] now . 
B|34| M:  ... [um] ... [um] ... [you know [,] um] ... 
A|35| A: Uh-huh , so . 
B|36| M: So . [what] [do] [you] [think] ? 
A|37| A: Yeah , okay , so this is probably [a] real hard _subject_ for [you] . 
B|38| M: [I] am [not] really interested [in the] [subject] matter . 
A|39| A: Yeah . Okay , well _, I_ guess [, um ,] we can discontinue our call now .
