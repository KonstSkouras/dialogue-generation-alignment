B|0| M: Yes , 
A|1| A: _Well _,_ _I_ have_ this new fondue pot _and_ _I_ was going _to_ _do_ basic cheese fondue _, and_ _I have_ two different kinds _of_ breads _and_ _some_ ham _and_ _I_ was going _to_ try something weird which , _you_ _know ,_ when _you_ _have_ fish au gratin _, I_ was going _to make_ _some _,_ uh ,_ _like_ fish chunks _and_ dip _it_ _in_ _the_ fondue . _I don't_ _know_ if _it_ will come _out_ . 
B|2| M: [I] 
A|3| A: _Yeah ,_ _the_ cheese fondue [I] _make_ _, some_ people _like_ swiss _, um _,_ I_ prefer cheddar . And _I'll_ mix _, I_ won't _make_ _, I_ won't _have_ _a_ sharp cheddar because _it_ , for fondue _I think_ _it_ _should be_ _a_ little calmer than _real_ sharp , cheddar . 
B|4| M: ' 
A|5| A: And then [I] was going _to make_ other things _like_ potato skins . 
B|6| M: what ? 
A|7| A: _see_ _you_ _don't_ necessarily _have_ _to_ dip this _stuff ._ And _, um _,_ I_ was going _to have_ broccoli _and_ cauliflower for _a _,_ _a_ vegetable_ . 
B|8| M: That sounds _good ._ 
A|9| A: _Oh_ _, yeah _,_ it's_ amazing _how_ vegetables trays will go at _a_ party . 
B|10| M: [I think] [it's] _more_ _that_ [I have] _more_ _of [a_ vegetable] 
A|11| A: _Yeah ,_ instead [of] something greasy or , 
B|12| M: _I like_ [to] eat _it with_ _my_ 
A|13| A: [my] _, uh ,_ girlfriends _do_ catering _and_ _they_ always , _about_ every party _they_ _do_ _is_ _they have_ [a vegetable] tray . _I think they_ try _and_ suggest [it] . 
B|14| M: _I'm_ _not_ sure what [you] _mean_ _by_ _that _,_ but _I_ do_ . 
A|15| A: _What_ _I've_ been doing when [I] _get_ invited someplace _and_ bring something _, I_ _make_ _, uh , food_ kabobs . _You_ take little toothpicks _and_ cut up _, uh ,_ pineapple _and_ strawberry _, and_ _even_ banana if _you can_ [do] [it] just before [you] leave . 
B|16| M: _I _can_ make_ [you] eat _a lot of_ [food] [, uh , food] . 
A|17| A: It stays _nice_ _and_ fresh . 
B|18| M: [Well [,] it's] [nice] [to have] [some] [food] [, uh [,] and] ... [food] . 
A|19| A: _Yeah_ . _Yeah _,_ I like_ those 
B|20| M: [You] 
A|21| A: Um , _they_ , _they_ made [a] couple [of] those [, uh ,] _they_ made one for [my] [, uh ,] bridal shower [and] [I] was pretty pleased . [I] _never_ made one for myself though . But _they_ look easy enough _to make_ [it's] [not] , 
B|22| M: They _are_ _good ._ 
A|23| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|24| M: [Oh] . [yeah] . _but_ _it would_ [, um ,] [be] very [, uh ,] difficult [to make] [a] thread 
A|25| A: _Yeah ,_ [you] probably _get_ this , probably pretty sticky after [you] _get_ done . 
B|26| M: [I] [know] 
A|27| A: Then you've got [to] drain _the water_ _out_ _of the_ watermelon because , [you] _know ,_ when [you] scrape [it] , [it] makes _the water ._ 
B|28| M: [Yeah ,] [I've] [never] _used_ [the water] pump _, but_ [I've] heard _that_ [you can] _use_ [the] pump _to get_ [out] [the water .] 
A|29| A: [Yeah [,] um ,] something [I do] _is_ [a] fruit , _is_ , _I'll_ [get] [, um ,] [make] _chocolate_ sauce [and] dip strawberries [and] bananas _in_ them . [Yeah _,] [I_ have] two nieces [and] _they_ , _they_ _they_ go melt [some] _chocolate_ chips , Go buy _me_ [some] strawberries . 
B|30| M: Nope _, I don't_ . 
A|31| A: [Yeah ,] [you] _know ,_ if [you] [get] [a] sweet strawberry _they're_ _much_ better [, but] if [you] [get] [a] sour strawberry , 
B|32| M: [I] [know] 
A|33| A: Huh . [Yeah ,] no , _they_ [, um ,] [the] strawberries [are] _coming_ _in_ season now _from_ , _they're_ , _they're_ _coming_ up _from_ Florida , [of] course . [I] live _in_ Vermont _, so_ . But _they're_ really reasonably priced , _they're_ _coming_ up _from_ Florida _, so_ . 
B|34| M: _So ,_ [coming] 
A|35| A: [Yeah] . 
B|36| M: Are [they] ? 
A|37| A: [Yeah [,] [I] think] [the] [, uh ,] actually _I think they_ [get] [, um _,] some_ [of] them _from_ South _America ._ 
B|38| M:  ,... 
A|39| A: Yep , [they] _, [a_ lot of] [, um ,] [of _a] [,_ um _,] winter produce_ comes _from_ South _America ._ 
B|40| M: [I think [they] have] [, uh [,] [some] ,] uhm [, winter produce] [coming] [from] south [America .] 
A|41| A: Of course , their seasons [are] switched . 
B|42| M: [You] [, uh ,] _might_ _want to_ check _your_ math . 
A|43| A: [So [,] um ,] [do] [you] [want to] discuss [the] recipe ? 
B|44| M: They [do] [, but] _I'm_ [not] sure [about] [how] [much] [they're] worth . 
A|45| A: [I have] [a] recipe if [you] [want] 
B|46| M: _I'm_ [not] sure . 
A|47| A: Um , [it] filled _, [a_ lot of] people try [to] stay away [from] this [but I] [make] [my] own homemade pudding just because [I don't] [like] box pudding . 
B|48| M: _I think you_ [should be] _careful_ . 
A|49| A: [Yeah ,] [it] [, and] [it] if [you] [, um ,] well , first [of] all [I] take [about] [a] quarter [and] [a] half [of] milk [and] [I] put [it] _in_ [a] two quart saucepan [and] [you] put [it] on [a] really low heat . 
B|50| M: Wait , what ? 
A|51| A: And [you] [want to] [use] one [of] [your] [good] sauce pans [that] dissipate [the] heat because [it] , [it] ends up burning [, I] [mean] , no matter [how] [careful] [you] [are] [you] still [might] [get] [a] film on [the] bottom _of the_ pot . 
B|52| M: [I] 
A|53| A: [I don't] let [that] worry _me ._ And [I] [get] [the] milk lukewarm [and] then [I] pour [about] [a] half [a] cup [of] cornstarch _in_ [it] [and] [I have] this thing [it's] called [the] slender blender , [it] , [it] makes [the] [, uh ,] [it] makes [, uh _,] a_ whip topping [out] [of] milk if [you] [get] [the] milk cold enough _. It's_ [, uh [,] I don't] _know ,_ [they're] called moo goo leaves or something [they're] 
B|54| M:  
A|55| A: [Yeah] . They're _real_ neat . 
B|56| M: [you] 
A|57| A: [I think] [they're] _real_ reasonably priced [, some] [of] them , [they] _used to_ [be] [a] hundred dollars [and] [they] _used to_ whip skim milk into [a] dessert [but I] didn't [get] [that] one [, I] got [the] Black [and] Decker _kind_ . But [, uh [,] it's] _real_ handy because [it] doesn't [have] [a] cord [and] [you] beat this cornstarch _right_ into [the] [the] milk , [you] _know [,_ and] [it] _does_ an excellent job , or just _hand_ beat [it] . [I] guess [you] could [use] [a] _hand_ mixer [but [I] don't] [think] [it] [I don't] [think] [it] gets [it] [good] enough . 
B|58| M:  . 
A|59| A: And then before [the] milk gets too hot [, um [,] I] add two beaten eggs [and] [I] really mix them _in_ [good .] And then [about] [a] half [a] cup [of] sugar [and] [I] let [it] pretty [much] [, I] beat [it] [like] every minute for [about] ten seconds [and] [it's] , [it] starts thickening , when [it] thickens [the] cornstarch [might] [get] [a] little [, I don't] _know ,_ [it] gets [like] little globs [of] this rubbery cornstarch [, and] [you] just keep beating [it] _in_ . And [it's] [the] , [the] trick _is_ , _is_ [to have] this blender _, so ,_ if [you] were , you'd [have] [to] probably almost go [out] [and] someone who's just going [to make] [it] first time [, it's] , you'll [have] [much] better luck if [you] had one [of] these little blenders . And then [you can] add _cocoa powder_ [to] [it] [to make] _chocolate_ or after [it's] thickened [I] cook [it] for _a good_ , once [it] starts boiling [, I] just [, I] cook [it] for _a good_ seven minutes , seven [to] ten minutes 
B|60| M: laughs 
A|61| A: [and] then [you [can] make] _chocolate_ or [you can] take [it] off [and] let [it] cool [you] put [, um ,] really [good] vanilla favoring _in_ [it] [and] [some] butter [and] [that] makes french vanilla [, um ,] custard . [Yeah ,] 
B|62| M: defic 
A|63| A: _A_ _chocolate_ _powder ._ 
B|64| M:  . 
A|65| A: [Yeah ,] [that] _cocoa_ _, yeah ,_ [the] unsweetened . It comes _in_ [like] _a real_ dark [can] , 
B|66| M: Is [that] [a real] [cocoa powder] ? 
A|67| A: our mothers _used to_ [use] [it] . And then , 
B|68| M: [It's] [not] [even] [cocoa [powder] [.] It's] [chocolate] . 
A|69| A: [Yeah ,] we all _used to_ , 
B|70| M: i [used to] eat [that] [stuff .] Tis [a good] source [of] vitamin c 
A|71| A: _yeah [,_ it's] [the] unsweetened _kind_ [it's] [not] [like] Nestles Quik . 
B|72| M: [What] [is] unsweet tea ? 
A|73| A: [I] suppose [you] could [use] [that] . 
B|74| M: [Yeah ,] _I'm_ [not] [a] fan [of the] taste 
A|75| A: [Yeah [,] but] [, um ,] 
B|76| M: Cooked [chocolate] [is] [so] [good] 
A|77| A: [Well [,] I] [used [to] make] [the] regular pudding , [the] [chocolate] [and] put [it] _in_ [the] pie shell [and] if [it would] sit _in_ [the] refrigerator for [a] day , where [you] cut [the] pie , [it would] soak into [the] pie shell [and] [it] was [like] red [, and] [I'm] _like ,_ oh , this [is] _kind of_ groedy . 
B|78| M: [What] [does] [it] taste [like] ? 
A|79| A: Um , actually [I] found [it] _in_ one [of] [my] mother's [, um ,] homemade cookbooks [, I] [mean] , something she had collected [out] [of] WOMAN'S DAY or something . 
B|80| M:  ... did [you] ? 
A|81| A: [So ,] 
B|82| M: What's ? 
A|83| A: [I think you] couldn't [make] [it with] [a] _hand whisk_ or , or [a] regular beater [but] [, um ,] 
B|84| M: [A] [hand whisk] ? 
A|85| A: [Yeah [,] but I] still [think] [a] beater [would] [do] [it] [good] enough [, um ,] [the] trick [is] [to get] [the] cornstarch , 
B|86| M: Beats [me .] [I'm] [not] [a] fan [of] [that] [kind of] [stuff .] 
A|87| A: [um _,] yeah _,_ right_ _in_ [the] _, in_ [the] lukewarm milk . Sometimes [I] put [the] cornstarch _in_ [a] separate bowl [and] [I] [would] put [it] _in_ [the] sink [and] _I'll_ take [my] lukewarm milk [and] put [it] _in_ [the] cornstarch [and] beat [it] [good .] It seems [to] [be] better than putting [the] , [the] cornstarch into [the] liquid [it] , once [it] hits [the] top [of the] liquid [it] seems [to make] little balls [and] [stuff] on [the] top . 
B|88| M: [You] 
A|89| A: [Yeah] . And _I'll_ [do] this [, uh ,] sometimes _I'll_ put [my] after [I] pour [that] into [my] , _back_ into [my] saucepan . _I'll_ put [the] eggs _in_ [the] same dish [and] beat them up [and] then pour [the] cornstarch [and] [the] milk mixture _in_ [the] egg . [So ,] 
B|90| M: [my] . 
A|91| A: Yep . And then , [you] _know ,_ if [you can] put [your] [cocoa] _in_ [with] [your] cornstarch if [you] wanted [to] . _The_ [cocoa] [even] seems [to] thicken [it] [even] [more] . 
B|92| M: [the] . 
A|93| A: Because [by] [the] vanilla doesn't seem [to] thicken as well as [the] , sometimes [the] [cocoa] [is] _like ,_ [my] husband really likes [it] thick he says [, [I] can] stick [the] spoon _right_ _in_ this . 
B|94| M: [The] , 
A|95| A: Because [I'm] always worrying [it] won't firm up because [it] , when [you] take [it] [out] [of the] saucepan [it's] _like ,_ boy [, I] hope this thickens [a] little [more] because [it's] [not] [like] [real] package thick , [you] _know ,_ when [you] cook [a] package [, it's] [, it's] [a] little less , 
B|96| M: [I] . 
A|97| A: [but I] put [it] _in_ [a] [nice] glass bowl [and] [, um [,] some] people [don't] [like] [that ,] [that ,] film on [the] pudding [so] [you can] put [, uh ,] Saran Wrap over [the] top . 
B|98| M: [I think] [, I [like] [,] in] [, [a] [,] so ,] 
A|99| A: And then once [the] pudding starts cooling [it] makes little balls [of] [water] on [the] Saran Wrap [, so ,] when [you] pull [the] Saran Wrap _back_ , [you] sort [of] [should be] [a] little [careful] , pull [it] _back_ [and] shake [the water] off [the] Saran Wrap [and] [I] [might] put [it] _back_ on . But [, um ,] 
B|100| M: [I] 
A|101| A: [Yeah ,] after , well when [it] starts steaming [a lot] [, uh [,] I] definitely _, yeah ,_ put [it] [in] [the] refrigerator , 
B|102| M: [Yeah [,] uh [,] yeah [,] yeah] 
A|103| A: [but] [, um [,] I] , [my] father always told [me] if [you] put hot [food] [in] [your] refrigerator you're going [to make] [it] work too hard . 
B|104| M: [I'll] [be] [back] . 
A|105| A: That's [, yeah ,] 
B|106| M: [I] [know [,] right] ? 
A|107| A: [so ,] that's why [I do] [that] . 
B|108| M: [I can] [see] [the] future . 
A|109| A: [So ,] well [, I don't] [know] that's [my] , [my] great hard recipe .
