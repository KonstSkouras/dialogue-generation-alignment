B|0| M: That's 
A|1| A: Yeah . Yeah my husband was complaining _the_ other day because he said every time _I_ turn _around_ you're telling me _some_ new rule _about_ _recycling_ like yesterday _I_ was tell him , _you_ _have_ _to_ , you're supposed _to_ squeeze _the_ plastic jugs before _you_ take them _up_ _there_ . 
B|2| M:  
A|3| A: Every time he turns _around_ _I'm_ giving him _some_ new rule , where you're supposed _to_ squish _up_ _the_ , _you_ know , like collapse _the_ plastic jugs . Instead _of_ taking them _up_ _there_ solid . 
B|4| M: _what_ 
A|5| A: And _I_ wish that our _recycling center_ took _paper bags ._ _They_ won't take those . We like _to_ put our , _just_ put our newspapers _in_ _a_ _paper_ bag , _you_ know _, and_ then carry them _up_ _there_ that _way_ . 
B|6| M: [I] don'ts 
A|7| A: And we _have_ _to_ bring _the_ _paper bags_ _back_ every time . Because _they_ won't take them . 
B|8| M:  
A|9| A: Do _you_ , uh , take your papers somewhere or does someone _pick_ them _up_ ? 
B|10| M: We're [the] [recycling center] . We're [the] ones who _make_ [paper bags .] 
A|11| A: Uh-huh . We , um , we _don't_ take our _cans_ _up_ _to_ that [center] , though , our aluminum _cans_ , we like _to_ take them _to_ one _of the_ places where _they_ pay _you_ _for_ them . 
B|12| M: What _do_ [you] mean ? 
A|13| A: Uh-huh . 
B|14| M: No , _it's_ _not_ . 
A|15| A: Yeah , _it_ takes us _about_ _a_ year _to_ save _up_ _enough_ _to be_ worth , [you] know , worth bothering _to_ _go_ _in_ _and_ _do , but_ . Do [you] , um , _have_ _any_ ideas on anything that would [make] , 
B|16| M: Uhhh ... [I] don 
A|17| A: Uh-huh . 
B|18| M: Well _, I guess_ [I'm] gonna [go] find [some] _more_ _garbage_ [to] [pick] [up] . 
A|19| A: Right . 
B|20| M: [I] am _so_ confused . 
A|21| A: Yeah that would _be_ _a good_ idea . 
B|22| M: [I'm] _not_ sure [about] [the] best [, but] [I'm] sure _I could_ [do] _it ._ 
A|23| A: Yeah . 
B|24| M: What [about] [just] sending _a few_ trash [cans] ? 
A|25| A: Right . Yeah , that would _be_ [a] real _good motivation_ _for_ people . 
B|26| M: It's [a [good] motivation] . I'll [be] doing [it] again soon . 
A|27| A: Right . Yeah , my father was telling me [about] [some] program he read [about] where [you] buy your [bags] , like [you] buy your [garbage] bag from [the] city , 
B|28| M: [I'm] [back] . 
A|29| A: _and_ [you] pay [more] than [just] [what] [you] would pay _for_ an empty [garbage] bag [but] then [you] _don't_ pay _any_ monthly fee or anything , [so] how ever many [bags] _of_ [garbage] [you] throw away , that's how many [you] _have_ [to] pay _for_ . 
B|30| M: yes , 
A|31| A: Yeah . Yeah that would [be] [a] real [good] idea . [I'm] _trying to_ _think_ if there's anything else [I could] _think_ _of_ . _They_ _are_ talking [about] going [to] curbside pickup _in_ our , _in_ our city . 
B|32| M:  ... 
A|33| A: Rowlett , _Texas ._ 
B|34| M: [I'm] [in] [Texas .] Where [are] [you] ? 
A|35| A: Do [you] know where that is ? 
B|36| M: [I] live [in] LA 
A|37| A: And [I] _don't_ know if _they_ decided _to _do_ ,_ or [not] _, but I_ _think they_ said [it] was going _to add_ like either [a] dollar or three dollars [a] _month_ [to] your bill [to] _have_ them [do] that . Although [, I] _think_ [a] lot _of_ those programs can operate at [about] [a] break even , break even point , without charging people . 
B|38| M: They're still [trying [to] add] [it] [, and] [they] [have] [the] technology [to do] _it ._ 
A|39| A: Yeah [I] _don't_ know , uh [, I guess] [it] [just] depends on how [they] manage [it .] 
B|40| M: Is [there] [any] [way] [to] change [the] date [of the] [month] ? 
A|41| A: [I] _don't_ know how much [they] get when [they] sell all that stuff . The [center] that they've got now where [you] take your stuff [in] [I] [, I] _think_ that should [be] making [some] _money_ . Since [they] [just] [have] [to] hire someone [to] man [it] [a few] hours [a] week . 
B|42| M: [what] . 
A|43| A: And [they] sell [, I guess] [they] sell everything [to] [some] waste company that comes [and] gets [it .] 
B|44| M: [They] [do [, but] I] don t [think they] [make] [enough] [money] [to be] profitable . 
A|45| A: But [I] wish that , uh , [more] [of the] [cans] , [you] know , like [the] [cans] [you] buy vegetables [and] fruit [and] stuff like that [in] were recyclable . [I] _don't_ , [a] lot [of] that's that recyclable steel [and] [I] _don't_ know anybody that takes that . 
B|46| M: So ... 
A|47| A: my husband likes Pepsi [and] those [cans] [are] steel instead [of] aluminum , [so] we can't , can't ever recycle them . [I] [think] [it's] [a good] reason [to] quit buying [it .] 
B|48| M: It's [garbage] 
A|49| A: Yeah , that's [what] we buy [the] most [of] , unless we're going on [a] trip or something where we want [to] , put [the] [cans] [in] [a] cooler 
B|50| M: Steel [cans] . 
A|51| A: But , well that's all [I] can really [think] [about] _for_ [recycling] . 
B|52| M: No , [they] [don't] . 
A|53| A: It was [good] talking [to] [you] . 
B|54| M: Thanks [for] [the] talk . 
A|55| A: Uh , bye .
