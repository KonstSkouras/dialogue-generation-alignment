B|4| M: No _, and , and_ [it] , 
A|5| A: Uh-huh . 
B|6| M: _I think_ _so_ . [uh] . 
A|7| A: Uh-huh . And [I] _know_ when [I] spent , _the_ time _that_ I've studied in Mexico , [uh] , Spanish _was_ one of my majors in college , _that_ , [uh] , _there_ _was a_ kind of _a_ lot of resentment _there_ towards America ,

B|12| M: [I mean ,] 
A|13| A: Uh-huh . 
B|14| M: _Yeah [,_ and] [there's] ... 
A|15| A: _Well ,_ that's _right_ , because that's just [so] much of _the_ way _that_ _they_ make their money [and] [so] many communities _have ,_ [uh] , _have_ _to_ _have_ _that_ _for_ farming 
B|16| M:

A|33| A: recently 
B|34| M: [So] [what] [have] [you] been up [to] lately ? 
A|35| A: [Yeah ,] fairly recently . _Well ,_ that's [really] sad . [I] hadn't thought [about] _that_ in [a] long time . 
B|36| M: [Well ,] they've been _on_ [the] front page [for] [a] while now .
