B|47| M:  ... [and [,] [we] have all the] rain [we] need [, we] can [get _the] birds_ [out] . 
A|48| A: [Well ,] [yeah _,] they don't_ _like_ [it] [in] here because there's nothing [to] eat 
B|49| M: [Yeah , but] [you're] [in the] kitchen . 
A|50| A: [and] when [you're] as busy as one [of] those babies , you've got [to] eat [most] _of [the_ time] . 
B|51| M: [I guess [,] it's] [like] [a little] food 
A|52| A: [And] [we] got [a] few [, you know [,] we] put up some hummingbird _feeders_ [and] some bird _feeders ._ 
B|53| M: [The] kids _are_ _the best_ [feeders .]
