B|35| M: _You_ okay ?

B|37| M: What do [you] mean ?

B|45| M: [It's] [a] shame [they] [don't] [see] [it] [that] way . 
A|46| A: [You know ,] um [, [I] [,] I think] [nursing] homes [are] , [are] , um , [some] [are] _good_

A|48| A: _I [have_ to] say [that] .

A|50| A: [But] for [the] most part [I] truly believe _that the_ parents _would be_ better if [they] were [with the] children .

A|52| A: Um , 
B|53| M: Do [you] want [to] [see] [a] kid [with] [a] mom ? 
A|54| A: Right [, right] . 
B|55| M: _I'm_ saying [that the] real people [in the] world [would be] able [to] [see them] all [day .]

A|58| A: [I] hope _so ._ 
B|59| M: Hopefully [so [.] That's] [good] . [But] . So . Bad . [But] . 
A|60| A: [You know ,] _it's_ [, _I think] it's_ very difficult [in the] first [place] [to] make [that] choice _to have_ [them] _go_ there . 
B|61| M: Why do [you] [think] [so] ? 
A|62| A: _And then_ if [you] find _out_ [that] [they] [are] [not] having [good] care , [you [know] ,] [I'm] sure [that] [it] [is] _just_ , [you [know] ,] you'd pull [them] _out_ [of] there [so] fast . 
B|63| M: [Yeah [,] that's] what [I was] thinking . 
A|64| A: [And] [, uh ,] _and_ yet if [you] didn't feel like [you] could _be _a_ good_ _caretaker_ _I don't_ [, uh ,] _it's a_ very , very [hard] decision [I think] . 
B|65| M: _I know_ 
A|66| A: Uh-huh . [I think that's] [right] , 
B|67| M: [I think] _you're_ 
A|68| A: _and_ especially if [you're] _not a_ person [that] [is] like [a] [medical] person maybe or something [that the] person needs [medical] treatment . 
B|69| M: [I think it's] possible _, but_ [it's] [not [a] good] [idea] [to be a] medic [and] [a caretaker] . 
A|70| A: Now [I know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] [father] [, uh ,] she brought [to] her [home] [, uh ,] [to] live there [, but] he needed [the] [medical] treatment [and] she had [a nursing] person come [in] like three times [a] week [to] , [to] help him _out_ . 
B|71| M: He [can] get [a good] doctor . 
A|72| A: [And] [that] might [be a] partial solution , or something . 
B|73| M: [I think it's] [just] an excuse [to have] [a] baby . 
A|74| A: [But] , um [, I] personally am for [the] _trying it_ [at] [home] [caretaker] part before [I think] I'd ever , 
B|75| M: The problem [is] [that] [they're] probably [not] [trying it] [out] [in] [a] [home] . 
A|76| A: [Yeah] . [Yeah] . 
B|77| M: [And then] ? 
A|78| A: [Well [,] [I] [,] I think] we kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|79| M: [I don't] [think] [so .] 
A|80| A: Good [to] hear from [you] .
