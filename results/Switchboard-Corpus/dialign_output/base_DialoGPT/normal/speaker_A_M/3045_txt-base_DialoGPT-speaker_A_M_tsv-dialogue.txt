B|30| M: _I don't_ _think_ _that's_ _the_ case . 
A|31| A: [Yeah ,] yeah . _Um _,_ I_ [I'm] [a] , [a] writer [by] profession and [, uh ,] when , when [I] was _first_ _here_ [in] , [in] Dallas or [in] Plano _, um ,_ and was finally _able to_ , [this] _is_ , oh , [been] _like_ fourteen years ago we moved _here ._ And [I] was finally _able to_ afford [a] new typewriter , and [I] [got] [an] [I] B M Selectric . [I] thought [I] had died and gone [to] heaven because [I] thought , oh , [they're] [so] wonderful . 
B|32| M: It's 
A|33| A: Well , then _, um ,_ 
B|34| M: _I'm _not_ really_ _, I'm_ _just_ ... 
A|35| A: [Yeah ,] ours [really] needs _to have_ some work done on _it_ but , but then [my] husband _, um ,_ worked at T [I] and [I] [got a] _, um ,_ [this] has [been] years ago he doesn't work there anymore , but he [got a] _, um [,_ uh ,] [the] , [the] T [I] professional and brought [that] home and [I] learned Wordstar on [that] , 
B|36| M: _It_ , 
A|37| A: and , _boy_ once [that] happened , there was [just] no way [that I] could [ever] go back [to] doing anything [of] length [of the] typewriter . 
B|38| M: [I] am [so] glad _you were_ [able to] 
A|39| A: Uh-huh . 
B|40| M: How _did_ [you] learn [, uh] . learn ? 
A|41| A: [Yeah] . _Have you _ever_ used_ , _do you_ use WordPerfect [ever] ? _Have you _ever_ used_ WordPerfect ? Or , 
B|42| M: _I've_ _never_ , [ever _used] it_ 
A|43| A: Uh-huh . 
B|44| M: [Have you ever] heard [of the] _word_ [, uh] . 
A|45| A: Right . 
B|46| M: Uhhh . _it's a_ _thing_ 
A|47| A: [Yeah ,] yeah . That's probably where you've [used it] . 
B|48| M: _I've_ [used] [a] few [of] [them] . 
A|49| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . _Um _,_ [I_ have] [that] on [my] [, uh ,] computer _here_ and also _, um _,_ I do_ some work at U T D and [, uh ,] [that's] _what_ they [have] there and [it] was [just] [so] nice [to] be [able] [just] [to] step into [the] position and , and already _know_ [the] _you know ,_ already _know_ [the] , [the] software . And _, um _,_ _I_ don't know_ from [my] own experience _, um ,_ WordPerfect _is_ [just] [so] much better than , than Wordstar at least [the] version [of] Wordstar [that I] [used] _to have_ . [It] may be improved [by] now but , 
B|50| M:  
A|51| A: [Yeah ,] [it's] [, uh ,] Wordstar was [never] very intuitive [to] [me] . [I] mean _you know _,_ _you_ ,_ some [of the] commands [just] had nothing [to] _do_ with _, you know _,_ what_ [you were] supposed [to] be doing _what_ they _, what_ they [did] on [the] computer but [, uh ,] 
B|52| M:  
A|53| A: [I] mean _like_ _going_ _, um ,_ forward and backward [a] [word] or up and down [a] line [that] sort [of] [thing] [just] _, you know ,_ didn't match with [the] kinds [of] keys _, [you_ were] using . 
B|54| M:  ..., 
A|55| A: [Yeah] . 
B|56| M: It's [like] [, you know [,] I] _can_ 
A|57| A: And , but WordPerfect _is_ [just] [a] lot more intuitive [in a] lot [of] ways . And _you ,_ and [it] does [a] lot [of] things _too_ [that] if _you ,_ if [you] _do_ any kind [of] [, uh ,] research or anything [like] [that] where [you _have] to_ [, uh ,] use footnotes , [it] _is_ [just] wonderful . Because [it] keeps track [of] all _your_ footnotes . 
B|58| M: [I] 
A|59| A: [Yeah ,] and if [you] add [it] , if [you] put [a] footnote [in] , [in the] middle [, you know ,] if [you] come up with some new piece [of] documentation and [you] put [that] [in the] middle [of] _your_ paper and _have to_ footnote [it] [, you] [just] change _, um ,_ [it] [just] automatically changes all _your_ footnoting numbers [for] [you] . 
B|60| M:  
A|61| A: _So_ [, you know ,] [it's] [just] , 
B|62| M:  
A|63| A: [Yeah] . [Yeah] . And _I think about_ how [it] [used] [to] be if [you were] doing [a] paper and [you] had [to] go back and retype everything , and oh , [it] was [just] awful . _So_ _, um [,_ _I] don't know_ [I think] we [have] [just] become [really] spoiled . [But] [I think] , [it's a] nice kind [of] way [to] be spoiled 
B|64| M:  
A|65| A: _So_ _, um ,_ well [, [I] have] [not really] paid much attention because [I] clock , although [I think we've] probably [been] talking at least ten minutes [so] _, um ,_ if _you _,_ um ,_ unless [you have] some other things [you] want [to] talk _about_ as having [to] _do_ with P C 
B|66| M: [I think about] ? 
A|67| A: Well _, um [,_ I] was [a] technical writer [for] many years _, um ,_ 
B|68| M: You . 
A|69| A: and [my] husband and [I] actually met [in a] computer company . _Um [,_ I] was [a] tech writer and he was [an] engineer . And [, uh [,] so I] [did] tech writing [for] [a] number [of] years . 
B|70| M: _This is_ weird . 
A|71| A: Oh , _sure ._ 
B|72| M: [Um [,] um [,] um] . 
A|73| A: Got [a] problem , [huh] ? [Um ,] 
B|74| M: Hehehe . 
A|75| A: Oh . Trying [to] figure out _what_ all [that] was [about] , [huh] ? 
B|76| M: [I don't know] _. I'm_ [just] gonna leave [it] [here .] 
A|77| A: _But [,_ um [,] [I] have] [, um ,] [that] , [that] was [the] majority [of] [my] writing although [, um [,] [I] have] also done oh , free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . And [, um ,] [for] [a] while [I] had [a] [, um [,] uh ,] [a] partnership with [a] , [in] [an] advertising agency with another woman who [is] [a] , [an] artist . _So_ [I] [did] some advertising and P R but , 
B|78| M:  
A|79| A: [um ,] now [I'm] , actually [I'm] _, I'm not_ working anymore [. I'm] [a] student [, I'm] [a] graduate student [so] [I'm] doing [a] lot [of] writing but [, uh ,] now all [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|80| M: What [do [you] [,] I [do] you] ? 
A|81| A: [I've] done [a little] , [a] lot [of] different kinds , but [I] [, I] [just] [know] _right_ now [that I] couldn't [have] put out half [of] _what_ [I] [did] if [that] much without [the] being [in] computers [so] [that's] [been] [really] great . And [, uh [,] I'm] [, so] [I'm] real spoiled . 
B|82| M: i 
A|83| A: [Yeah] . 
B|84| M: What's [your] day 
A|85| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . 
B|86| M: Heh [. I'm] ... Not [a] bit . 
A|87| A: Good . 
B|88| M: How [do [you] know] [about] [that] ? 
A|89| A: That's great . 
B|90| M: [I] [know] . 
A|91| A: [Yeah] . 
B|92| M: [So] ? 
A|93| A: Well , [those] [are] skills [that] she certainly [is] _going to_ need early on and [, you know ,] [the] , and [it] seems [like] [it's] getting earlier and earlier with [the] children . 
B|94| M: You [know [,] I'm not] [sure .] 
A|95| A: [So] [, um _,] I think_ [that] [that] would be [a] real , [a] real [, uh ,] advantage [to] , [to] her _to have_ [that] and [, uh ,] [do] [it] early , 
B|96| M: She's [a little] [too] smart [for] [that] . 
A|97| A: [so] [. Uh] , [do] 
B|98| M: [I think] she's [going [to] [have] to] make [a] joke [about] [that] [first] [, I think] 
A|99| A: Oh , neat . 
B|100| M: [I] [know ,] [right] ? 
A|101| A: Yes . Right . Oh , great . 
B|102| M: It's ok . 
A|103| A: Right 
B|104| M: [But [,] what] [about] [it] ? 
A|105| A: That's great . Well , [that's] [a] , [that's] [a] skill [that] she [can] use [for] [the] rest [of] her life [, so] Might as well start now , [huh] ? 
B|106| M: She's [a] good [boy] . 
A|107| A: Well , Nola [I have] enjoyed talking with [you] thoroughly . [This is] [really] [going to] be fun [I think] , 
B|108| M: [I don't know] . 
A|109| A: and [, um ,] [my] husband [is] [a] ham radio operator and [I think about] all [the] people [that] he talks [to] all over [the] ,
