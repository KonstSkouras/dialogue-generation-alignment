B|56| M: [I think] he's _talking about_ [the movie] . 
A|57| A: and , and so , [it] [was] , [it] [was] [a] much more intense [book] than [the] sort [of] flimflam [that] [they] cast off [in the movie] 
B|58| M: I'm [not] [really] [sure] _what_ you're saying . 
A|59| A: And , anyway , [we] are [not] [talking about] [that ,] but [, uh ,] gee [, I] just [I like] to [read] gardening books and things [like] [that .] Just to tell me [what] to _do_ with my garden and [, uh ,] And [, uh ,]
