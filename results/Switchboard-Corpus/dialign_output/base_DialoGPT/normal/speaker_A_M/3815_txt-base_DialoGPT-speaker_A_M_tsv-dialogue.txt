B|2| M: What kind _of_ _car_ ? 
A|3| A: _I_ see

A|5| A: Top [of] , top [of] _the_ line . 
B|6| M: How is _this_ _a_ thing ? 
A|7| A: _Oh_ . 
B|8| M: You're _not_ _my_ friend . 
A|9| A: Uh-huh . Right , right . 
B|10| M: _No ,_ _it's not_ . 
A|11| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|12| M: Uhh , _what_ ? 
A|13| A: Well _, I guess_ [I'm] [, uh ,] more traditional in _that_ _I don't like_ power windows _or_ power locks _, because_ _the_ _people_ _that_ _I know_ who _have_ them always seem _to_ _have_ trouble with them . 
B|14| M: [Oh] , well [, I guess] _that's_ how _you_ feel . 
A|15| A: _And_ [, uh ,] so _I _don't_ [,_ I] just _don't like_ anything _that_ _I can't_ figure out why _it_ doesn't work 
B|16| M: Why ? 
A|17| A: _And_ then [I] want , _you know ,_ _good_ [, uh ,] gas mileage and [I] want an air bag and _, uh [, I_ guess] , 
B|18| M: [And] _that's_ [, uh _,] _it_ ._ 
A|19| A: [No [,] I] haven't . _Have_ [you] ? 
B|20| M: [Have] u ever ? 
A|21| A: Somehow [I] just _think_ , _you _know _,_ _I_ like_ the idea_ 
B|22| M: _I'm not_ _sure_ [, I] [have] no _idea ._ 
A|23| A: Right . 
B|24| M: You _sure_ ? 
A|25| A: Right , [that's] [a] _good_ [idea .] 
B|26| M: _I , actually_ [, I like] [that] [idea .] [you know [,] _because] [,_ uh , I] [think] it'll [, uh] ... save lives . 
A|27| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|28| M: How _do you_ _do_ [it] ? 
A|29| A: Well [, [I] , actually] _I don't know_ [a] lot about different brands . [I] tend _to_ [have] , [you know ,] [my] requirements _like the_ last time [I] bought _a car_ [I [,] I guess] [I] did sort [of] prefer American and [my] requirements were basically , [you know ,] _good_ repair record , _good_ mileage [, uh ,] and [I] needed air-conditioning and [, uh ,] _can't_ remember [what] [my] , oh [, I] wanted [uh ,] _stick shift ._ [And] , so [I] didn't [have] [a] whole lot [of] choice There _was_ one [car] in all [of] _the_ , _the_ metropolitan area [that] [I] could _find_ [that] , [you know ,] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with _a stick shift_ in [it .] 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: _It_ [, it] turned out _to_ _be_ [a] , [a] Chrysler . [Uh] Lancer . 
B|32| M: [No] . 
A|33| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|34| M: A . [uh] . [Yeah] , [shift .] [shift .] 
A|35| A: [No ,] [a] five _speed_ . [And] _it ,_ basically [, it] _was_ something [that] [a] military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up , and so [it] had been on _the_ lot _three_ months and they were really eager _to_ sell [it .] 
B|36| M: Was [it] [a] [three] [or] four [speed] ? 
A|37| A: So [, I guess] in [this] area , at least , [you know ,] _if_ [it's not] automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [It] _was a_ manual . 
A|39| A: Well [, I] just wanted [it] [because ,] again [, I] had [, I guess] traditionally always had _a _car_ that_ had one and _I thought_ [it] would _be_ more reliable . 
B|40| M: I'll . 
A|41| A: [Uh ,] 
B|42| M: Why _do you [like_ the] _stick shift ?_ 
A|43| A: [I] found [that] out . [I] mean , [you know ,] [the] _people_ would just sort [of] look at me [like] , [you] must _be_ crazy when [I ,] went in _to_ , and asked and [that] [was a] requirement so , 
B|44| M: [I can't] [find] any [stick shift] [car that] has [a] manual transmission . 
A|45| A: So , 
B|46| M: That's [what] [I thought] . 
A|47| A: Well [, I'm not] even [sure] all [of] them are anymore . At least in [this] area . 
B|48| M: [I] am . 
A|49| A: Not [that] [I] [was] looking for sports cars _, but_ , now [the] _people_ I've talked _to_ _don't_ seem _to_ [have] _stick shift ._ 
B|50| M: [I know] [the] majority [of] [people] [don't [,] but] I'd [be] willing [to] drive [a stick shift] [car] [if] [it] meant driving manual . 
A|51| A: [And] so why [do you like] [stick shift ?] 
B|52| M: [I] love [stick shift .] 
A|53| A: Uh-huh . 
B|54| M: [I don't [know] , [I] don't like] stickshift . 
A|55| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|56| M: It's [like] [a car] . 
A|57| A: Right , and [actually] [it's] probably safer on , [you know ,] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [I like the idea] [of] [it [,] but] [I don't [know] [,] I'm not] [a] very [good] pilot . 
A|59| A: So , 
B|60| M: [Yeah] , yeah .
