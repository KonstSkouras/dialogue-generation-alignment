B|1| M: _I've_ _been to_ Detroit _a few_ times . 
A|2| A: Right , okay . 
B|3| M: _You_ _were_ . 
A|4| A: Right . _So_ _you_ probably wouldn't recommend _that_ as _a big_ _tourist_ spot ? 
B|5| M: _I was_ _. I'm_ _not_ _really_ [a] [tourist] though . 
A|6| A: Ooh , _that_ _would be_ _nice_ . 
B|7| M: No , _not_ _that _._ _I_ don't_ _think_ _so_ . 
A|8| A: Did _you_ scuba dive _there_ ? 
B|9| M: _I_ live _in_ Brazil _, it's_ _just_ [a] [tourist] _place_ _in the_ middle _of_ nowhere . 
A|10| A: Ooh , [that] _would be_ _nice_ . 
B|11| M: They _have_ _some_ [nice] beaches _, and [a_ big] aquarium . 
A|12| A: _Oh ,_ [that] _would be_ enjoyable . Right , yeah , _that's_ _, a_ [nice] break . 
B|13| M: _Well ,_ _I'm_ _from_ Australia _. I'm_ _not_ _going_ _to_ [be] _able _to_ _go_ to_ any _other_ countries _, so I guess it_ [would be] _fun ._ 
A|14| A: [I] haven't [been] on vacation [in] _a while_ either . Um , usually _when_ _we_ [go] _, we_ [go to] Colorado , [to] Estes Park area . Which _is_ up kind [of] near Denver . _And ,_ uh , stay [in the] mountains up _there_ , _do_ [a] little hiking [and] resting , _get_ away [from] [the] Texas heat , [that] kind [of] _thing_ . 
B|15| M: [So] ... How's _it_ _going_ ? 
A|16| A: [So] [it's] _a lot_ [of] [fun [.] I] worked up _there_ last summer [, so I guess _it] was_ kind [of] _like_ [a] vacation _the ,_ whole summer long 
B|17| M: [I] can't 
A|18| A: Worked _at_ [a] camp _there_ [, and] [so I] got [to] spend _a lot_ [of] time up [in the] mountains . [So] _that's_ probably _my_ favorite [place] _when_ _I _have_ [to_ go] somewhere on [a] vacation . 
B|19| M: oh , [like] . 
A|20| A: _Oh_ . 
B|21| M: What [do] [you] _mean_ ? 
A|22| A: _That's_ [nice] . We , um _, we_ canoed up [in] Arkansas _at the_ Buffalo River . 
B|23| M: [I] 
A|24| A: _And_ _that's_ [the] best [place] [that] [I've] ever canoed . 
B|25| M: _You_ can't [be] serious . 
A|26| A: _It's_ [really] , [really] _pretty_ [. [I] _was] a_ little kid _then_ [, and] _we_ [to] [have] , uh _, we_ stayed _at_ [some] _park_ [and] they had [a] little uh , mountain man who came down [the] river every night [, and] he [would] give [a] little _talk_ _about_ mountain things _. _You_ know _,_ I_ [think] he wasn't [a] real mountain man , but _we were_ _pretty_ convinced he _was a_ full , hermit who lived up [in] _, the_ woods , [that] he'd come [in] his little log boat down [the] river , 
B|27| M:  
A|28| A: [and] _we_ [would] _have _to_ ,_ we'd [and] he'd make sassafras tea _out_ [of] sassafras roots [that] he'd found [and] , _That's_ [a] _good_ _family_ [place] [to go] , 
B|29| M: _Yeah _,_ the _,_ you_ [, a] [to [,] the] [to ,] he's 
A|30| A: _and then_ [the] river [was] [really] [nice] because [it] wasn't _too_ frightening , but [it] wasn't [, you] _know ,_ _too_ easy either . 
B|31| M: _Well_ . 
A|32| A: _It was_ [like] , 
B|33| M: [that's] [a] [pretty] cool [family] tree 
A|34| A: _That's_ true . 
B|35| M: [You] can't [really] learn new skill [when] _you are_ older _, it's_ [like] [you] [have to] [be] [really] [good] [at] something . 
A|36| A: Uh-huh . Right . 
B|37| M: [Oh] ? What [about] [it] ? 
A|38| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|39| M: [So] _you're _not_ a_ bad person [then] . 
A|40| A: [Well ,] [that's] _good ._ [Well _,] we_ , um , let's _see_ [, the] only [other] [place] [I've] ever vacationed , we'd [, you] _know ,_ [go] on camping trips up [to] Texoma [and] things [like] [that .] 
B|41| M: _I don't_ [know ,] maybe . 
A|42| A: _And_ [then] [I] went [to] England [a few] years ago . 
B|43| M:  ... [and then] ? 
A|44| A: [I _was] a_ , _student_ _there_ [and] spent , um [, a] semester studying abroad [in] London . 
B|45| M: What [was] [the] school ? 
A|46| A: _And_ [that] _was a_ great time , because [it's] [so] , [that's] such [a] neat [place] [and] [it's] , there's [not a] _language_ barrier [so] [you] [don't] _, I_ [mean] _, there_ there's [a] little bit , because there's [some] [of] those English words [that] [you] [just] [don't] exactly [know] _what_ they [mean] [, and _a] lot_ [of] _people_ [have] trouble wrestling _with_ their accents , but [it's] , _it was_ [really] [fun [.] I] _, I_ _, I_ [really] enjoyed [that [.] I'm] probably [going] back _there_ [to] work , _for a_ year . 
B|47| M: Fun . 
A|48| A: _It_ [, it's] [really] [nice] [. I] [would] _, I_ [would] spend all _my_ time [in] London , or _most_ _of my_ time , 
B|49| M: [I] 
A|50| A: [and] [that's] _it was_ [really] different being [in] [a big] city , because [I don't] _get_ much into urban [, you] [know ,] [really] urban areas _a lot_ 
B|51| M: [I] 
A|52| A: [and] _it was_ [, it's] [really] [, it's] sort [of] [a] weird little anonymous feeling _where_ _no_ one knows who [you are] [and] [you] can spend [a] whole day without talking [to] anyone , which [I] thought [I] [would] [just] hate , but [it] ended up being kind [of] [nice] because [you're not] accountable [to] anyone . 
B|53| M: No 
A|54| A: [You] could [just] kind [of] kind [of] walk around [and] observe , 
B|55| M: [You] 
A|56| A: [I] _did_ _a lot_ [of] [just] [going] _out_ by myself [and] riding on [the] subway [and] watching _people_ . 
B|57| M: Why [not] [just] [go] [out] [to] [the] [park] ? 
A|58| A: _And_ [I] had [a] great time doing [that .] _It was_ [really] interesting . 
B|59| M: [Yeah [.] You] [do] [have to] [talk] [to] [other] [people] _to get_ [the] message across though . 
A|60| A: [Yeah _,] _I know_ ,_ 
B|61| M: [I've] [been] [going] _to see_ [it] _for a while_ now . [It's] [so] awesome . 
A|62| A: [I] keep wanting [to get] up [to _,] I_ haven't _, I_ haven't [been] anywhere else outside [the] United States [. I] haven't [been to] Mexico or _Canada_ or , 
B|63| M: _That_ sounds [really] cool . 
A|64| A: [Oh] . 
B|65| M: [I] live [in] [Canada] 
A|66| A: [Yeah ,] [that] [would be] [nice] [. I] had [a] friend [from] _there_ . 
B|67| M: [I'm] [from] [Canada] [, I know] [where] [it] [is] . 
A|68| A: Then [I] , I'd love [to go] somewhere [in] Asia , but I'd [have to] [have] [a] tour guide _with_ _me_ [to] help _with_ all [the] _language_ [and] all [that .] 
B|69| M: [That's] [good .] 
A|70| A: [So] , yeah , [that's] why , [that's] why England _was nice_ . Even _, we_ traveled [in] Europe [for] [about] [a] week [, and] [that] [was] even [nice] because _there_ wasn't , uh [, the ,] _most_ [the] places _we_ went _, we_ went [to] Germany [and] Switzerland [and] , 
B|71| M: [Oh ,] 
A|72| A: [Yeah _,] we_ [have] . We . We _did_ _, we_ whirlwinded through , Europe . 
B|73| M: _That_ [is] [a lot] 
A|74| A: _It was_ [just] insane twelve days [where] we'd [just] stop [like] [a] city [a] day [, and] [you] slept on [the] train [at] night . 
B|75| M: [You know ,] 
A|76| A: But _there_ wasn't [a] , _it was_ strange , _it was_ kind [of] sad _, there_ wasn't ever [a] _language_ _problem_ _there_ , because everyone [in] Germany knew English [and] everyone [in] Switzerland , knew English . 
B|77| M: [I was] [in the] middle [of] [the] bus [at the] end [of my] shift [, there] [was a] [problem] [with] German 
A|78| A: [So] _we were_ kind [of] pitiful . We found one restaurant _we were_ [in] [and] got seated [, [and] then] _no_ one knew English [in] [there] [, and] _we were_ [just] finally had [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking up things . 
B|79| M: [Is] [it] [just] bad ? 
A|80| A: But _it was_ , 
B|81| M: [That's] [what] [you're] supposed [to] [do] [with] your first [language] , [not] your first meal . 
A|82| A: [Oh [,] I] had fondue . [That] [was] easy [to] say 
B|83| M: What [was] [it] ? 
A|84| A: Tried [to get] fondue [and] white wine [, and] [that] [was] , 
B|85| M: [I don't] [think] [you] [did] 
A|86| A: _we were_ [able to] [have] [that] [pretty] , [pretty] effortlessly . There [were] [some] [people] [at the] next table who spoke English [, so] _we_ elicited their aid [for a while] 
B|87| M:  ... how [do] [you] [do] this ? 
A|88| A: [and] , they _were very_ helpful 
B|89| M: [And [,] [we] [were] very] friendly 
A|90| A: [so] , _It was_ , _it [was_ a] pleasant time . 
B|91| M: [I know] [it was] 
A|92| A: I'd , I'd love [to go] back [there] . There's [just] [not] time There's [not] enough time [to go] [see] everything [, [and] then] [to] afford [to see] everything . 
B|93| M: i dont , 
A|94| A: Right . [That's] 
B|95| M: [I know ,] right ? 
A|96| A: [That] [and] sleeping late 
B|97| M: [I'm] [a] college [student] [, so [I] have] [no] money . 
A|98| A: [I] keep hoping [for] . 
B|99| M: This [is] [the] [most] important [thing] [for] [me] . 
A|100| A: [Well] [it _was] nice_ talking [with] [you] . 
B|101| M: [It [was] nice] meeting [you] [too] 
A|102| A: [And] [have] [a] [good] afternoon . 
B|103| M: Good morning , sir . 
A|104| A: Okay . 
B|105| M: No , [I'm] sorry . 
A|106| A: Good-bye .
