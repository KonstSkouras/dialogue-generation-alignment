B|0| M: _I_ _do_ believe . 
A|1| A: Well , there _are_ _a_ lot _of_ things _that_ _people_ , [I] think general , 
B|2| M:  ... 
A|3| A: Well , [I] think it's _interesting_ _to_ look at , uh , where _the_ money goes , and it goes _a_ lot _of_ places where it probably ought _not_ go and and [I] don't think generally , [I] think what's _interesting_ _is that_ we probably represent _the_ majority _of_ _people_ in this country in terms _of_ their feelings _about _the_ government_ 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: and _how_ it serves us given _the_ extraordinarily large sum _of_ money _the government_ has _to_ operate with . 
B|6| M: The [people] _have_ [a] _right_ _to be_ _free_ _from_ oppression . 
A|7| A: And _that_ , what [I] think _is_ going [to be] really _interesting_ _is_ what we [do] _about_ it . [I] mean , we _are_ going [to] [have] [to] change _the_ [people] who represent us . 
B|8| M: We . 
A|9| A: [I] mean , and [I] think it's going [to be] real _interesting_ [to] see and , and then force upon them , uh , 
B|10| M: I'm _just_ saying _, that's_ [not] [how] [the] system works . 
A|11| A: _Yeah ,_ [right] [that's] [I] think [that's] [the] only _thing_ [that's] going [to] change it . 
B|12| M: It's _a _very_ interesting_ [thing] . 
A|13| A: Our anger _is_ going [to] [have] [to] , [to] give rise [to] , [to] more activity on our part . 
B|14| M: This _is a_ shame . 
A|15| A: Uh , I've , I've said for years _that_ there's full employment for [the] politically active and in our society , uh , there's [very] little full employment . Most [people] in this country _are_ getting worse off , [not] better off . 
B|16| M: It's [not] [about the] economy . It's [about the] economic situation . 
A|17| A: Eighty percent _of the_ public , according [to] Bill Moyers' , uh , recent , uh , piece for , uh , Public Broadcasting , which , by [the] way [is [a] very] good use _of_ _government_ money . [I] think P B S [is] wonderful . But this special focused on [the] fact _that_ eighty percent _of the_ [people] in this country _are_ , _are_ seeing their real incomes , and thus , standards _of_ living , decline . And twenty percent _are_ seeing theirs improve . That's [not] [a] formula for [a] better society . 
B|18| M: [I] 
A|19| A: And _the government_ really plays [a] role in this . 
B|20| M: _You_ . 
A|21| A: [I] mean , well , _they are_ [the] [people] whose strings _are_ pulled and by [I] guess powerful 
B|22| M: _What_ [are] [they are] ... 
A|23| A: [You] know , and it's really [interesting] [to] see [how] _that_ affects [people] because essentially more and more [people] in this country [are] [not] likely [to] revolt in [the] way _that_ [people] used [to] think _of_ , _of the_ voter revolting . But [people] [are] pretty much getting [the] picture _that_ some [people] get taken care _of_ and others don't and [they] think it's unfair , and when [they] recognize _that_ it's their tax money , they're going [to] [do] more [about] it . [I] I'll tell you one quick , uh , one [thing] [very interesting] . C B S , after [the] State _of the_ Union address [is] going [to] open up [a] telephone line , an eight hundred number and [people] _can_ call in and say what [they] think [about] what's going on in this country . 
B|24| M:  
A|25| A: They expect , opening it for one hour , _that_ they'll get three , hundred thousand telephone calls . 
B|26| M:  ... 
A|27| A: And I've thought for years it would make [a] lot _of_ sense [to] create an eight hundred number for voters [to] call and , and vent their frustration with _government_ . _Like_ one , eight hundred capitol or something like _that ._ [You] know , [just] [a] number you could call [from] anywhere , anytime . 
B|28| M: yes . 
A|29| A: [I] think [that's] coming and [I] think once , once [people] really start [to] communicate [how] [they] feel , things [are] going [to] change . Until then , [I] think , you know , it's going [to be] really painful . So [the] question [is] , [how] soon [are] we going [to] start [to] get our money's worth and , as you said , it's [how] soon we get involved , and [I] think we need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to] get involved , like allowing us [to] call [a] toll [free] number and say , hey , look , [do] it this way , [not] _that_ way , or [I] like this , or [I] don't like _that_ , or this [is] [how] [I] feel [about] your spending my money on art _that_ [I] don't think [is] art . 
B|30| M:  
A|31| A: Well [, that's] [the] good [thing] [about] what [is] happening because [I] think more and more [the] news media , which takes [a] heck _of a_ beating and , and deserves some _of_ it , [is] telling us , you know , [about the] problems . So [the] more we communicate , hey , look , we want [a] change here , because , you know , as it turns out , we've wasted [a] tremendous amount _of_ money on our defense spending in this country . 
B|32| M: [Like] . lol 
A|33| A: Over [a very] long period _of_ time . 
B|34| M:  
A|35| A: Uh , and , uh , 
B|36| M: [Yeah ,] but [the government] [can] [do] [that .] 
A|37| A: Right . 
B|38| M: [Yeah ,] [the] whole point [of the] movie [is that] [the] entire [thing] [is a] bit [of a] mess . 
A|39| A: [Yeah] . Well , you may [be] [right] . [What] [I] think [is] really going [to be] [interesting] [is] [to] see [how] , uh , we as [a] society deal with it and [I] , and [I] think it [is] , what you say , it's , it's [a] ,
