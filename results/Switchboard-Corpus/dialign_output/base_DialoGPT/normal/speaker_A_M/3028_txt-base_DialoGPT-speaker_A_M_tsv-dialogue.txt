B|74| M: [Yes .] [uh , um] 
A|75| A: [Well ,] [if] [you're] looking [for] [a] nice , Uh-huh [. [Well] [,] [I] guess] [if] [you] [were] having , [if] [you] [were] trying [to] impress somebody [like] taking somebody [that] [you] hadn't seen [for] _a long_ [time] [and] wanted [to] show them _a good_ restaurant .

B|80| M: [I don't] [know] . 
A|81| A: Because they're , [Well , they] _have_ [lunch] specials [that] [you _can't] ,_ [you can't] beat [that] price [, uh ,] [if] [you] went [to] [a] cafeteria . 
B|82| M: Why [do] [you] hate [the] red lobster ? 
A|83| A: [Well [,] I] had [the] [, I] had [a] broiled chicken breast [and] [it was] excellent . It [was] [a] marinated , broiled chicken breast [and] [it was] 
B|84| M: _I'm_ [not] , 
A|85| A: [Oh] [, it was] , 
B|86| M: _I _know_ , I_ [was] joking . 
A|87| A: [Well ,] [I've] never had catfish either _in_ [a] restaurant because [I'm] _from the_ _north_ [and] [that] [was] [a] no no . 
B|88| M: [No [,] it's] [a] [food] . 
A|89| A: _And_ [I] haven't gotten over [that] _from the_ _north_ . 
B|90| M: You're [from the] south . 
A|91| A: [I know] [they] say [that] , [that] [is] , 
B|92| M: [The] [north] [is] _best_ 
A|93| A: but _I'm ,_ but they've got _all_ these caution signs now on _fish_ 
B|94| M: _That's_ [a good] [thing] , though . 
A|95| A: [and] _so_ [I] [kind of] stay 
B|96| M: he's gonna go down 
A|97| A: Because [of] _all_ [the] pollution _in the_ lakes [and the] , everywhere . [I] [mean] [there] isn't any safe haven anymore [for] _fish ._ 
B|98| M: Why ? [I] love [the] lake . 
A|99| A: [and] especially [, uh ,] _in_ Wisconsin [and] Michigan [they] say , no , buying [of] our _fish ._ 
B|100| M: [It's] [all] [about the] [fish .] 
A|101| A: [I] , [Well ,] yeah . So [I] am [, [and] the] , [the] [best] brand [of] chicken [to] buy [is] [the] [, uh ,] Pilgrim Pride because [they] [don't] use [all] these hormones [to] remote [, uh ,] unnatural growth _in_ [their] products . 
B|102| M: [I'm [,] well ,] _I'm , [I_ don't] , stop eating 
A|103| A: So [I] [mean] , _we_ _have to_ [be] on [the] lookout _if we_ [want to] stay healthy . 
B|104| M: We [have to] [look] [to the] future . 
A|105| A: So [I'm , I] , [you] [know , I] , 
B|106| M: Are [you] sure ? 
A|107| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . Corrode . Huh . 
B|108| M: [I'm] [so] confused .

B|110| M: [I don't] [, uh [,] [I] don't] [want [to] [,] uh] ... 
A|111| A: [Well ,] _I'd_ [like] [to get] ahold [of] [some] engineers [and] knock [their] heads together [if] [it] [would] [do] any [good .] 
B|112| M: Err [, yes] . [I'd] rather [have] [the] metal [in the] water , rather than [a] mess [of] rust . 
A|113| A: [Oh] , dear . 
B|114| M: [They] [don't] [. They] [have [a] long] life . 
A|115| A: Wow . 
B|116| M: [It's a] joke . 
A|117| A: Sure . [Yeah] . 
B|118| M: [Well ,] [this] [is] old . 
A|119| A: [That's] [right .] Everything _we eat_ . Everything , everything _we eat_ should [have a] label on [it] 
B|120| M: [And] [what] [if [we] eat] [it ?] 
A|121| A: [Yeah] . 
B|122| M: [But] [we] [can't ,] [right] ? 
A|123| A: [Well ,] [you] [know ,] 
B|124| M: [I] [think] [I know] . 
A|125| A: [Well ,] Becky , [you] [know ,] even [if] [you] lived off your own land , [that] [you] [would] [have to] put caution signs ,
