B|4| M: _Well ,_ _what_ _do_ _you_ _do_ ? 
A|5| A: _I_ _think_ it's because he's always heard [music] _in_ our home all [the] , since he _was a_ baby . 
B|6| M: _He's a_ weird guy . 
A|7| A: _Uh ,_ my husband and my other son , who's eleven just got through singing _in_ [a] musical [here] , _in_ , _in the_ community at Music Man .

B|12| M: _So_ _what's_ [the] story ? 
A|13| A: And _so they_ went and tried out and my husband _played_ Harold Hill from [the] Music Man and my son _played_ one [of] [the] children [in] [a] band . 
B|14| M: The actor [who] [played] [the] doctor [was a] _child_ _, [so_ they] [were] [the] _child_ actors . 
A|15| A: [So] , yeah , _it_ [was] really [fun] , and _, uh ,_ my son plays [the] clarinet [in] his band at _school_ , and my daughter takes piano lessons , [too] . 
B|16| M: Did _you_ _go to_ [school] ? 
A|17| A: But _, uh [,_ we] just really like [music] . _It's_ [a] _, I_ _, I_ especially like _it_ as an outlet when [the] T V goes off [, we] get [the] T V off and just [have] some nice quiet [music] . 
B|18| M: _I love_ _it ._ 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: Uhh [, uh , I] don 
A|21| A: _Uh [,_ I] [have] him take from [a] friend [of] mine [who] teaches _Suzuki_ . Which _is_ an auditory type learning experience . 
B|22| M: What _do_ _you_ [think] ? 
A|23| A: _You listen_ [to] [the music] and then learn [to] play [it] by by hearing [the] intervals and things like that . 
B|24| M: Uuhhhuhuhuh . Uhuhuh _. [You_ listen] , uhuhuh 
A|25| A: [I] teach [, uh ,] like [what] _is_ traditionally taught , [you] _know_ , [you] look at [the] note on [the] page and [you] play [what's] on [the] piano _, but_ he can't learn like that . [He's a] delayed [child] . [He's] only _about_ [, _I] guess_ he's _about_ two and [a] half [in] his real understanding [of] things . 
B|26| M: Ohh . 
A|27| A: And [, uh [,] so] when my friend [played] something on [the] piano and he [played] [it] [, uh ,] with his right hand [, we] went , wow 
B|28| M:  
A|29| A: [we] better [have] him [do] [do] something [. _You] know_ , educationally . 
B|30| M: What [do] [you] mean ? 
A|31| A: [So] that [was] really [fun] . 
B|32| M: We are [, uh ,] um , friends .

B|38| M: [I] am [the] most beautiful person [in the] world . 
A|39| A: Oh [, I] [think] _that's_ great . 
B|40| M: [It's] why . 
A|41| A: That's really hard [I] [think] , because , especially if [you] start them and then [they] get pretty _good_ and then [they] get close , ten , [you] _know_ , eleven or something , [they] [go] [, _I] don't_ want [to] [do] this anymore and you're like God [, I] really want [you] [to] [do] [it .] 
B|42| M: N 
A|43| A: _You know_ . 
B|44| M: [I don't] [think] [you] should _, but , I_ 
A|45| A: [So] sometimes it's hard [to] , [to] _know_ exactly when [, but , [I] don't] _know_ , if she acts like she wants [to] or says she wants [to] maybe [you] could [have] her take some for [a] while and see how she likes [it .] 
B|46| M:  
A|47| A: Uh-huh . 
B|48| M: [It's] awwwww 
A|49| A: That's like me . 
B|50| M: [You] .

B|52| M: [Well] done ! 
A|53| A: _that's_ for sure . 
B|54| M: [I guess] [so] 
A|55| A: [I] , my friend [is] , [is] very generous [in] , [in] letting us [have] my children [, uh ,] [do] [the] _Suzuki_ method without paying [a lot] out . 
B|56| M: [You know] [what] , [that's] [a] [good] point . 
A|57| A: [Yeah [,] so] it's been [good] for our _family_ . 
B|58| M: What [about] your [family] ? 
A|59| A: [I don't] [have] any _Suzuki_ students . _Uh ,_ 
B|60| M: [Uh ,] [have] [you] ever had [a] [Suzuki] student ? 
A|61| A: Something happening [to] me at Christmas time that , that verified [to] me that [I] will
