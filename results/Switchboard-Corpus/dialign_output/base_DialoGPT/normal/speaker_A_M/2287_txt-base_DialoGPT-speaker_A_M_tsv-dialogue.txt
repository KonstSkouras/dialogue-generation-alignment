A|5| A: Yeah [, _I] think_ you're right . 
B|6| M: _I'm_ [not sure] _, but_ _I'm_ pretty [sure] _it's_ _a lot_ . 
A|7| A: Yeah , _or_ sometimes _they _don't_ like_ either [of the] choices _for the_ [candidates] , 
B|8| M: That's [the] main reason [I] dislike _it_ . 
A|9| A: so [they] _think_ , well [, you know ,] why _vote ._

A|17| A: Yeah . 
B|18| M: _Oh_ . _Well _,_ it's_ _, it_ . 
A|19| A: Yeah . It also seems [like] [maybe] another candidate [that] nobody wants could slip _in_ [if] [, you know ,] [not] enough people _are_ _voting_ . 
B|20| M: [I think] _it's_ pretty obvious [that] this _is_ _a_ bad idea . 
A|21| A: Yeah [, it's] kind [of] [like] _in_ Louisiana where _that ,_ _uh_ , _guy_ [that's] [like] [a] Ku Klux Klan member something _got elected_ . 
B|22| M: What ? 
A|23| A: Kind [of] scary when _you think_ _about_ _that ._ 
B|24| M: It's [not] 
A|25| A: _Oh ,_ gosh . 
B|26| M: Aha ! _I can't_ ! 
A|27| A: Yeah . 
B|28| M: Hey , [that's] [the] [guy] who shot [the] police officer [that] shot [the] [guy] _in the_ 
A|29| A: Yeah , people _will_ sit home and assume , oh , [that] [guy] would never get _elected_ . 
B|30| M: You're assuming [that .] 
A|31| A: Next [thing] [you know _,] you've_ _got_ _him_ . 
B|32| M: _Well [,_ you've] certainly [got] me there . 
A|33| A: Yeah . 
B|34| M: If [you] [go] [to] [a] polling station [, you know] who _is_ [the] president [of _the] party_ .

A|37| A: Yeah . Right . 
B|38| M: He [got elected] _, but_ [I think] [it's] [a] _bit_ [of] [a] stretch [to] call [him] [the] president . 
A|39| A: Yeah , _he_ [sure] did . 
B|40| M: [I think] [he] [got elected] _in the_ wrong state . 
A|41| A: Yeah . [I think] one [thing] [that] [maybe] would help people [vote] [is] [if] [the] polls were either open _more_ days , [or] [you] could mail [it] [in] , [or] something [like] [, if you] _have_ [, if you] _have_ real strict _work_ hours , and [you can] only [go] [like] at seven [in the] morning [or] after _work_ and [you] _have_ [to] stand [in] line [for] so _long_ 
B|42| M: [I] [like] this idea .

B|44| M: How _do_ [you] feel _about the_ [voting] _system_ ? 
A|45| A: Uh-huh .

B|48| M: i . [know] . [it] . beyond . your . mind 
A|49| A: Uh-huh . 
B|50| M: _I don't think_ there's [a] reason [for] [you] [to] [vote .] 
A|51| A: Yeah _, I'm_ [in] Dallas , and they're _long_ here too . 
B|52| M: You [know what] ? [I'm] [not] [a] fan [of the] Cowboys _, but_ they've [got] [a lot of] _good_ things _going_ _on_ . 
A|53| A: Yeah [, I voted] absentee one year . [I] really was [going] [to be] gone _. [So_ [,] I] did [it] [, but] , [uh] [, it] was nice . [I] would [be] tempted _to do_ [it] _again ._ 
B|54| M: [I voted] [for the] first _time_ [in] my life . [I'm] [not sure] I'd [be] able [to do] [that] [again .] 
A|55| A: Right . 
B|56| M: [I] [vote] yes 
A|57| A: Yeah . [I _think] they_ _should_ change [the] whole [system] so [that] [it's] easier 
B|58| M: Why ? It's [a] _good_ idea . 
A|59| A: [I think] _more_ people would [do] [it] [if] [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|60| M: And [, it's] been [a] [long] _time_ since we had [a] [system] [like that .] 
A|61| A: Uh-huh , 
B|62| M: [I'm] [not] [that's] _just_ , 
A|63| A: Yeah , [that] would [be .] [I] usually [vote .] A [lot of] times I'll [vote] [a] straight [party] ticket [just] because [I don't] take [the] [time] [to] find out [what] every [, you know ,] [other] than [the] major [candidates] , [what] [they] stand [for] [on] [what] issues , 
B|64| M:  , [work] .

B|66| M: [I] [vote] 
A|67| A: Uh-huh . 
B|68| M:  [, I'm] sorry . 
A|69| A: Yeah . 
B|70| M: [Oh [,] you] mean [that ,] 
A|71| A: No [, _I] guess_ it'd [be] best [if you] knew [each] person and [what] [they] stood [for] and why and everything . 
B|72| M: [So] ... [I guess] [I] [should] 
A|73| A: Right , and try [to] determine [if] [what] [you] read was objective [or not .] 
B|74| M: You [know] . 
A|75| A: Yeah . 
B|76| M: This isnt [a] story , its [a] compilation [of] [what] youve heard 
A|77| A: Yeah . 
B|78| M: Because [the] media [is] biased . Not [the] case with [the] elections . But we [do] [have] elections . They [are] very important [. So] . Do . They . Like . [it] . Much . Much [more] . 
A|79| A: Yeah . 
B|80| M: It's [a] joke

B|82| M: It's [just] [a] joke . It's [not] even funny . 
A|83| A: [Oh ,] yeah . 
B|84| M: The election _has_ been [in the] works [for] [a] while . 
A|85| A: Yeah , _the press_ [has] [a lot of] power . 
B|86| M: That's true . 
A|87| A: Yeah , oh [, but] , boy [you] try get into [that ,] you'd really open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|88| M: You [have] [a] point . They [have] no control over [the press] , [they] _can't_ control [the press] . 
A|89| A: Yeah , seems [that] [they] [should] regulate themselves [a] little [bit] , and [I don't _think] they_ ever _care_ [to] . 
B|90| M: [I'm] [not] saying [they don't] [, I'm] [just] saying
