A|1| A: His grandmother too _and_ they're , _that_ her son , his uncle , whatever , _you_ _know_ , anyway . He , _he_ has , _he's_ recently retired _and_ _so_ _he's_ _the_ one _who_ she moved _in_ with when she had _a_ stroke _and_ _, and_ all _the_ other children _are_ working or whatever . 
B|2| M: i . 
A|3| A: They're all my parents age . And , uh , _so_ _he's_ got , _you_ _know_ , his retirement though is _really_ twenty-four hours _a_ day . They _have_ _a_ day _care_ two days _a_ week . They call it senior citizen day _care_ . But she goes _in_ _the_ senior citizen center . 
B|4| M:  ... 
A|5| A: _So_ _he_ gets _a_ break two days _a_ week _but_ it's _only_ _for_ like two or three hours at _a_ time . 
B|6| M: _I'm_ [so] [he] ... 
A|7| A: And , _you_ _know_ , just , _you_ see _a_ lot of things like _you_ , _you_ _know_ , was _a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play _golf_ when [he] retired _, and_ _you_ _know_ _that a_ lot of _the_ things [he] thought [he] would do when [he] retired _he's_ _not_ able _to_ do now . 
B|8| M: _You know_ 
A|9| A: But [he] refuses _to consider_ _any_ other , _I don't_ , 
B|10| M: _You_ [don't] _think_ [he's] done [any] [golf] ? 
A|11| A: Yeah _, and_ is _that_ how your parents feel or , 
B|12| M: _That's_ _what_ _I'm_ _saying_ . _I'm not_ _going [to_ consider] [that a] loss 
A|13| A: Uh-huh . 
B|14| M: _I _know_ ._ 
A|15| A: Uh-huh . 
B|16| M: [I don't] [really] _know ._ 
A|17| A: [I know] at _this_ , [I know] [I] feel like [I] would never do [that] with my parents either , _you_ [know .] But _I ,_ [I] [really] feel bad _for_ _the_ _people_ [I] see [not] very , [I'm not] _really ,_ [really] experienced _but_ like [I] said [I] just _have_ [that] one family _, and_ [I] just [really] feel bad _for_ _the_ guy _who_ his whole life is different now _and_ , than [he] thought it would be . But , 
B|18| M: [you] 
A|19| A: Yeah _, and_ [he's] got , [you] [know] , seven brothers _and_ sisters _and_ _, and_ , uh , [he's] _the_ one because [he's] _the_ one [that] isn't [going to] work every day _and_ [that] she moved _in_ with when she needed [to] move _in_ with someone . And , 
B|20| M: [I] 
A|21| A: Oh , well , that's great . 
B|22| M: [I ,] 
A|23| A: [That's] [a] good idea . We ought [to] , Yeah _, and_ maybe when _the_ other brothers _and_ sisters retire or whatever , [I don't] [know] [what] they're [going to] do . It's [really] [not] my family . It's my fiancee's [so] [I don't] , [I] can't say much . 
B|24| M: _You_ 
A|25| A: But [I] always feel like [I] would never put my parents _in_ either _and_ [I] wonder , [I'm] [going to] be _the_ _only_ sibling [that] isn't [going to] _have_ children [so] if my parents do need [to] live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers _and_ sisters will be having teenagers around _and_ everything [to] _care_ _for_ . [You know] , 
B|26| M: Yay 
A|27| A: _and_ [I'm] , [I ,] that's fine with me . my fiancee _and_ [I] both figure that's what's , we're [going to] end up with both of _the_ parents or whoever . If [You know] [what] [I] mean ? We feel like , it's our responsibility , 
B|28| M: [I [,] and] 
A|29| A: [and] [I] feel like [I] would never put them _in_ [a] home . But [I] wonder how much , [you] [know] , if one of us is [going to] _have_ [to] quit work someday or retire early or something . 
B|30| M: [I'm not] . 
A|31| A: [You] [think] about it [and] it's _really ,_ [I don't] [know .] This _country_ kind of takes _the_ worst _care_ of _the_ elderly of [any] other _country_ . 
B|32| M: [I don't] [really ,] [don't] 
A|33| A: And , It's [really] more of [a] , um , like [a] respect issue [that] _the_ older , older _people_ _in_ other countries [that] I've _been_ [to] seem [to] [really] _have_ [a] lot more respect _for_ _the_ elderly _people_ [and] [, and] _they_ [really] seem as wise [and] [, and] _in this country_ nobody [really ,] Yeah , nobody [really] pays attention 
B|34| M:  
A|35| A: [and] _they_ , oh , _the_ old-timer made with _the_ old way [and] nobody respects _the_ traditions . And , [you] [know] , it's [I ,] [I'm not] [saying] [that] [I] do either _but_ [you] [know] , it's just funny 
B|36| M: [So] , [but] , 
A|37| A: [and] [, and] we [really] [don't] _have_ [any] [that] [don't] _have_ _the_ _Social_ Security [and] everything [really] isn't [that] much _for_ elderly _people_ [to] live on . 
B|38| M: [Social] welfare 
A|39| A: [You know] , even if they're _in_ good _health_ it's incredible . 
B|40| M: What ?! No . 
A|41| A: They [don't] _have_ [any] _, they_ [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe _they_ should , [you] [know] because we're all [going to] get old someday . 
B|42| M: The [only] [people] [that] [have] ever gotten [health] [care] [in this country] [are] [the] ones [who] [have] [been] living [in this] city [for] generations . 
A|43| A: And [so] it's [a] , it's kind of [a] depressing topic though . How old [are] [you] ? 
B|44| M: Yes [, they] [are] . 
A|45| A: [So] it is , yeah [, and] it must be rough [for] [you] too [to] see your grandmother . 
B|46| M: [I'm] [only] 22 .
