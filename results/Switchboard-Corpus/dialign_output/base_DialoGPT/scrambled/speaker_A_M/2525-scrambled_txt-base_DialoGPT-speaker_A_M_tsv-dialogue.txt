A|74| A: _Well , I'll_ keep [that] one [in] mind . 
B|75| M: She's [so] kind . 
A|76| A: _Oh ,_ yeah . [I] had [a] [, uh ,] last year [I] had [I] had another German Shepherd , now [this] one _was_ purebred and [, uh ,] _he_ , [when] _he was_ [about] seven months old [got] [a] gastrointestinal virus and _was_ [just] [about] _on_ death's door _but_ [, uh ,] managed [to] [get] _him_ [to] [a] veterinarian [in] [time ,] 
B|77| M: Uuhuh 
A|78| A: [I know] [it] [, I know] [it .] 
B|79| M: [I think] [he was] joking

B|81| M: [Oh [,] we're] . 
A|82| A: Which [is] _good_ . Yeah . But [, uh , [I] ,] [you] [know] _, it's_ funny [in] , [in] Colorado [when] [the] Broncos went [to] [the] Superbowl three times [in the] last [, [I] [don't] know] , five or six years whatever [it's] [been] . Um [, they] [have] these songs _on_ [the] radio [. They] take [popular] songs and , and change them [to] fit [, uh [,] the] Broncos and stuff . 
B|83| M: [It's] [a] song . 
A|84| A: Uh-huh . 
B|85| M: It [was] _by_ itself . 
A|86| A: Right . 
B|87| M: _That's_ [what] _I was_ wondering . 
A|88| A: _Well ,_ um [, I] seem [to] always [be] [in the] [, the] next [to] [the] last generation [of] word processing software . When everyone [was] [in] Samna [I was] [still] [in] P F M , and now [that] [I] finally become proficient [in] Samna everybody's _going to_ WordPerfect . So [, I] [can] _never_ quite stay current with [that .] 
B|89| M: [It's not] [, because] [it] [never] _happened_ [to] [him] . 
A|90| A: Yeah . Um , 
B|91| M: LOL [, it's] [good] 
A|92| A: _No ,_ [no] [, I] haven't . [Uh [,] [I] , uh ,] my father pays for my , my schooling , my tuition . So [, uh ,] [I'm] [, I] haven't made use [of] [that .] 
B|93| M: [It's] [a] _game_ , man . 
A|94| A: [And] , 
B|95| M: [Oh _.] [Well ,_ I'll] [have] [to] [go] [see] [a] doctor [then] . 
A|96| A: oh , yeah , we [they] called us at five and [the] [game] started at seven [so] we [just] threw everything together , ran [over] and [got] [the] tickets and walked and [so] we took [two kids] with us and nobody brings [two] children [in] these seats , [you] [know] [because] , 
B|97| M: [you] . 
A|98| A: [And] [so] [I think] , um [, it's] become real important [to] me [that] we try [to] spend [time] together as [a] family . So there's one or [two] nights [a] week , we [have a] , _on_ Monday nights we set aside [time] [where] [it's] called [, uh ,] family home evening and we stay home [that] evening , [all] [of] us , and we [do] things together . 
B|99| M: [No ,] [not] [you] . 
A|100| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|101| M: [I'm] [going to] [be] [there] , [but] [I'm not] [going to] 
A|102| A: Uh-huh . 
B|103| M: You'll [be] fine . 
A|104| A: All local . Were [they] [like] [all] [in] Dallas ? 
B|105| M: [I'm not] . 
A|106| A: Uh-huh . Yeah . Corrode . Huh . 
B|107| M: It , 
A|108| A: you're [just] as blessed , probably more [, because] [if] [you] follow [this] , there's [a] [good] book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING , [by] Richard Fugate 
B|109| M: Ohh , [I've] [been] _told_ . 
A|110| A: Unless somebody [is] trying [to] blackball them . 
B|111| M: LOLPT : ummm 
A|112| A: Uh-huh . 
B|113| M: [I'm not] [sure] [, I] [have] [no] [idea] . 
A|114| A: So [, uh [,] that] story [I just] [told] [you] [about] my mother's beautiful cousin [, well [,] the] same thing [happened] [here] [in] Arlington , [when] [was] [it] [, I think] [it] [was] , oh , [it] [was] almost [a] year ago [in] December [to] [a] girl [that] my daughter had graduated [from] high school with . 
B|115| M: [I'm not] [sure] [about] [the] best , [but] [I'm] [sure] [I] could [do] [it .] 
A|116| A: Yeah [. Well [,] I] figure [it's] [just] me and my _wife_ [but] , [you] [know] [, [I] like] [to] [do] stuff with my hands and whatnot , [so] [I] [want to] [have a] shop . 
B|117| M: _That's_ [what] [I was] saying . 
A|118| A: [That's] really nice [to] find out [that] [it's] behind [there] [Well ,] we pretty much [do] , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers . [I] couldn't even [think] [of] [what] [you] call them . 
B|119| M: [you] , i'm 
A|120| A: [Oh ,] wow . 
B|121| M: Your [wife] [is] [on a] diet .
