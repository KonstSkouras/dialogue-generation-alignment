3	5	, you know , I	137	A	10, 16, 146
2	5	a lot of people don't	137	A	10, 146
2	5	like that , but I	85	A	10, 94
5	4	, you know ,	137	A	10, 16, 68, 138, 146

2	4	, that's good .	11	A	110, 120
2	4	, uh , I	17	A	78, 94

2	4	and things like that	79	A	16, 94
2	4	because they know that	115	A	32, 146
12	3	, uh ,	135	A	12, 34, 36, 54, 56, 62, 68, 78, 94, 104, 136, 146

5	3	, and ,	131	A	16, 34, 44, 62, 146
4	3	, I think	133	A	14, 32, 54, 146
3	3	, but ,	137	A	10, 70, 146
3	3	, it was	67	A	16, 36, 82

3	3	it seems like	137	A	10, 42, 146
2	3	, I don't	15	A	2, 16
2	3	, I guess	45	A	10, 54
2	3	, that's good	11	A	110, 120
2	3	, well ,	129	A	10, 138
2	3	, yeah ,	75	A	4, 78
