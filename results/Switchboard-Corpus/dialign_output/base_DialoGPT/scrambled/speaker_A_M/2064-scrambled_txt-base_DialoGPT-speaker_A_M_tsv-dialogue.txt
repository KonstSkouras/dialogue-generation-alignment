B|73| M: [You] _got_ any ? 
A|74| A: And [I] [, I] [I was] actually talking [about] businesses purchasing something mail order and then having , having [to] pay sales tax on [it .] 
B|75| M: [But] [if] [they] _are_ [from] another country , [they] _are_ still citizens [of that] country . 
A|76| A: [I] , [Well ,] yeah . _So I_ am , and [the] _, [the_ best] brand [of] chicken [to] buy is [the] _, uh ,_ Pilgrim Pride because [they] _don't_ use all these hormones [to] remote _, uh ,_ unnatural growth [in] their products . 
B|77| M: What [would] [you] [like] ? 
A|78| A: [I mean , it's] worked successfully [in] Europe .

[But] now [they] [have] [like] [this] [, you] [get] these liners , [that] is garbage bags [, you know] , 
B|83| M: i 
A|84| A: [Yeah ,] [like] maybe [if] , [if] there [was] something [they] [could] [do] [in] their own , own [, in] their own town or city , yeah , and [not] [have] [to] pull up roots and [, you know] , go somewhere half way around [the] world , or something . 
B|85| M: Uhm ... what's [wrong] [with] [that] ? 
A|86| A: Uh [, I think] that's [about] where [it] is . 
B|87| M: [So [I] guess] [you're] [a] Texan ? 
A|88| A: _I don't_ [know] [, I] [just] [think _,] um ,_ somehow [I] hoped [that] as [a] people [we] [could] [be] better than , than _, um ,_ expecting _, the_ feeling [that] [it]
