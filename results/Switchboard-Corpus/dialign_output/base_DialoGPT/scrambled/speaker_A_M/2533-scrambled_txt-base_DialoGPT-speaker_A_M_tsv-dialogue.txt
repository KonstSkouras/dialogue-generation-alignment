A|70| A: Uh-huh , section , yes , uh-huh .

B|79| M: _What about_ [just] sending [a] few trash _cans_ ? 
A|80| A: About fifteen miles [. _I] live in_ [a] little suburb [, uh ,] which _is [,_ I] guess from Dallas [is] twelve miles or [so] 
B|81| M: _What_ ? 
A|82| A: Huh . 
B|83| M:  , 
A|84| A: Boy [that] [really] , [that] [really] takes someone who [is] bold _to _do_ that ._ 
B|85| M: [I think you] [mean] elementary school . 
A|86| A: And we footed [the] bill , because there [was] [not] any such _thing_ and when [they] [were] young . 
B|87| M: [I live in] Bradford . 
A|88| A: If _I didn't_ _have a_ _family_ [, [I] don't think] [I] [would] _have_ , as , as [a] male or as [a] , as an individual of , _in this_ stage of [my] life [, [I] don't think] [I] [would] _have_ insurance [, uh ,] other , 
B|89| M: [I've] had [a] cat . 
A|90| A: [but] [, uh ,] _this_ year [my] husband recharged our freon because [it was] , needed _to be_ done , and [one] of [the] [cans] released entire amount of freon into [the] [, uh ,] into [the] air because he opened [it] , 
B|91| M: [I know] [it is _,] but [I_ [don't want] [to] be] [mean] . 
A|92| A: Uh [, I] wish [it] [were] [a] little bit harder [to] [not] serve _on_ juries actually [. [I] mean [,] [I] know [,] it] [, it] [, it's] tricky because [I know [,] you] [know ,] an awful lot of intelligent people who [just] , well [I'm] too busy [to] serve _on_ [a] jury , 
B|93| M: Alright _, see_ ya [later] 
A|94| A: Yeah . 
B|95| M: [You know ,] [they're] kinda ... 
A|96| A: [I don't] [really] _like to_ put [a] lot chemicals _on_ [it] [but] then , again [, [I] don't want] [the] bugs eating [it] upping either . 
B|97| M: [that's] [a] pretty [cool] [family] tree 
A|98| A: [but] [it] , _this is_ her first credit card _thing_ , well , when she got her first [one] she [was] [so] excited [it was] unreal . Look at _this_ [they] sent me _this_ money [, you] [know .] So then when [I] explained [to] her , look [you] _have_ [to] pay _this_ back and [they] are _going to_ charge [you] interest , and stuff , of course , she tore [it] up . But [a] lot of parents [would] [not] take [the] time [, you] [know ,] and [they] wouldn't even [think] of [it] or their kids may [not] [be] as close as [my] daughter and [I] are , and [, uh [,] you] [know _,] they_ may [not] even discuss [it] _, they_ go out and cash their check thinking [that] [, you] [know ,] they've got something , maybe they've _won_ something . [You know ,] somebody sent them something free . 
B|99| M: _Oh , I_ [see . [I] didn't] [know] [you could] [do that .] 
A|100| A: Right , exactly [. I] [, [I] don't] [, the] [, [I] think] almost [the] only way [that] drug testing [can] [be] done fairly [is] [if] [it's] across [the] board from , from [the] janitors [to] [the] executive management . 
B|101| M: [We] douh 
A|102| A: Uh-huh . There's [a] lot of [that] _going on in_ Dallas , too . 
B|103| M: No [it] wasn't 
A|104| A: Where are [you ?] 
B|105| M: _They_ [won] . 
A|106| A: Yes . 
B|107| M: We're [going [to] do] [this] . 
A|108| A: [What about] [, uh ,] white collar crimes [like , uh ,] theft of trade secrets . 
B|109| M: [Well [,] they] [did] [the] same [thing] [with] [the] cat . 
A|110| A: [Well [,] uh [,] but I] [do] realize [that] , [that] [is] realistic for some people , 
B|111| M: Are [you] [a] native ? 
A|112| A: [Oh , [I] think] [that's] great . 
B|113| M: I'd [like to] [know] why [you think] [it's] [a good] idea [to] get [a] job [with] [the government] [if [you don't] [have] a] job . 
A|114| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|115| M: [I think] [it's] pretty obvious [that] [this is] [a] [bad] idea . 
A|116| A: [The] rest of them taking these vacations and using [the] taxpayers' money for [that .] 
B|117| M: s 
A|118| A: [Oh] [I know] [it's] [like] [the] end of [the] world . 
B|119| M: [What] [is] [going on [in] this] thread ? 
A|120| A: And [, uh [,] it] kind of makes me listen [a] little closer [to] , [to] [the] piano when [I] hear [it] at other places , or when [I] [, you] [know [,] see] some [, see] and hear someone playing [. I] sort of watch their technique , too , and , and [see] [if] [it] corresponds up [to] [what] she's learning . 
B|121| M: Ok , bye . 
A|122| A: and then , 
B|123| M: sighs 
A|124| A: and somebody will turn [it] [in] and , and nothing will [be] missing . [They] said [they] [can] [just] [about] guarantee [that] there , [that] , [that] [would] happen [if you] [did] _that . [I_ thought] , boy , [in] America , [if you] left [a] purse [on] [a] subway [, you] [would] never [see] [it] again . 
B|125| M: [I know] [that [. I] just] wanted [to] [say] [that] [I've] played golf [with] [him] [a] few times . 
A|126| A: Yeah . 
B|127| M: [What] [do you think] ?
