A|34| A: Uh-huh . 
B|35| M: _So [,_ but ,] 
A|36| A: _I don't think so ._ 
B|37| M: We . 
A|38| A: _that's_ _why_ [I have] [so] many _different_ levels [of] P C around _at_ [the] moment . 
B|39| M: _You_ [have] _family_ ? 
A|40| A: Uh-huh . 
B|41| M: [I _don't] have to_ 
A|42| A: _And_ [little] boys _are_ around [the] house [a] whole _lot_ _more_ _than_ girls . 
B|43| M: _Oh ,_ _is that_ _what_ [you] [think] ? 
A|44| A: Uh-huh . 
B|45| M: _Oh [,_ I] _see_ .

A|50| A: Uh-huh . _Yes_ . 
B|51| M: [Yes _,] it's_ _not_ [a] _problem_ . 
A|52| A: _That's_ _about_ [my] extent [of] , um , _about_ baseball _, I don't know ,_ [that] _much_ _about_ _it ._ 
B|53| M: _I'm just_ glad _he's_ _not_ [in] jail . 
A|54| A: Uh-huh . 
B|55| M: _So [,_ uh _,] what_ [are] [you] _guys_ [up] [to] ? 
A|56| A: [I] haven't had [my] oldest [one] quite nine years , I've had _him_ probably five years . 
B|57| M: [That's] _really_ cute . 
A|58| A: Right . 
B|59| M: Sorry _. I just_ _wanted to_ _say_ _, I _have_ a_ feeling _that the_ others [are] [the same] [as] _me_ . 
A|60| A: [It's] [like] [a] Macy's , kind [of] store , 
B|61| M:  
A|62| A: My husband quit [a] perfectly wonderful job [and] decided [that] , well , _we_ both decided _we_ [wanted to] move [to] North Carolina . 
B|63| M: U ? 
A|64| A: [Oh ,] mercy . 
B|65| M: Why _not_ _just_ _go_ out [to] [the] park ? 
A|66| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . [Well , I] _was_ [just] reading an article _in [,_ uh ,] [a] North Carolina paper today where _a high_ school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth [of] scholarships for herself by sitting [up] _at_ night [and] typing _at_ [, uh ,] letters [of] applications [to] universities . 
B|69| M: _So _,_ we're_ [all] [just] living off [of] [their] [at] [their] expense . 
A|70| A: [Well , I] come _from_ _a very_ small [family] . _And_ _we_ planned [a] [family] reunion this spring . Uh , where _we_ [are] _from_ Texas [and] [my] [family] [is] _from_ Ohio [and] _we_ met [in] Florida . 
B|71| M: [That's] _what_ [I mean] . 
A|72| A: Because [I don't] [like] credit cards for [one] _thing_ [, you] _know , [I_ mean] , they're okay [, I] guess , [if] _you're_ on [a] trip or something [, you] [don't have to] take [a] whole bunch [of] [, you] [know ,] cash _with you ,_ 
B|73| M: [I] _agree_ . I'd rather [be] poor [than] _have [a_ high] cost [of] living . 
A|74| A: [Well [,] I'm] mother [of] four , [so] basically [I'm _just] ,_ real _busy_ _with_ [my] [kids] [right] now [in] sports [, and] _we_ [have [a] little] Halloween talent show tonight [, and] [, I] substitute [at] [the] schools part-time . 
B|75| M: [That's] _not_ [a very] [nice] [thing] [to] _say_ . 
A|76| A: [Well , I] found [, uh ,] [that] _, [in_ the] _place_ [that] [it] _was_ harder for [me] [to] stick [to] [a] budget _was_ [not] where _we_ [were] concerned [, but] where maybe our friends [were] concerned [and] our relatives [and] parents . 
B|77| M: [Well , I] _agree with you [,_ _but] I_ [can] _see_ [it] 
A|78| A: If , [if] , [if I] had [the] car [I] [wanted] . 
B|79| M: Do [you] [like] [to] eat ? 
A|80| A: _Yeah ,_ exactly . 
B|81| M: [is] [it] bad [that] i [was] [thinking] [of] [a] [different] [place] ? 
A|82| A: Uh-huh . 
B|83| M: _So_ ? [It's] [just] [a] title . 
A|84| A: [I mean] [, _I] hate_ [it] 
B|85| M: [I [have] a] couple [of] yellow peppers . 
A|86| A: [I] guess [my] , [my] _best_ would [be] probably sixty-eight when [you] wake [up] or sixty-six [, and] then probably seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|87| M:  ... 
A|88| A: Sure . 
B|89| M: We've got _some_ [of the] [best] presents [in the] world . 
A|90| A: [I] _, I don't_ understand [it] , _they_ consider [it] violent [. [I] have] [so] ever [, I have] seen [it] on , where _we_ _are [,_ [I] live _in] [,_ uh ,] Rochester , New York [, and] _I think_ [a] , 
B|91| M: [Well ,] [how] [much] ? 
A|92| A: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [And] _he's_ _always_ [busy] . 
A|94| A: [Well] . 
B|95| M: The . Joke . About . This . 
A|96| A: My , [my] [little] boy has gotten [so] into [it] [that] [he's] identified [the] , [the] people [that] [have] written certain songs , then [he] buys [the] pieces [that] [have] [that] person . [You] [know ,] on _it ._ 
B|97| M: _I'm not_ _sure_ [how] [you] could _say_ _that ._ 
A|98| A: A , [a] bedroom for [my] mother [, and] [, uh ,] 
B|99| M: [You] [are [,] [in] [,] in] ? 
A|100| A: For music ? 
B|101| M: Is [it] [a] [place] ? 
A|102| A: _Yeah ,_ [that] must [have] been [at] least fifty years ago or _more_ [, but] [the] point [of _the] story_ [is that] , [that] [was] [so] unbelievable [a] [thing] [in] those days [that] [it] [was] [in] [all] [the] papers , [all] over [the] country for weeks 
B|103| M: _I'm not_ , 
A|104| A: Sure , _yeah_ , 
B|105| M: [Well] [that's nice] 
A|106| A: [So ,] [so] [I] guess our vote [is] no 
B|107| M: _I'll_ , yuh , money 
A|108| A: oh , _yeah_ [. I] guess [it] [is] [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] _more_ [and] _more_ people [are] [like] [that .] But , um [, I] guess [it's] because [I'm] older [, [I] mean] [, I'm not] real old [but I] _am_ older [and] , um [, you] _know , I_ didn't feel [like] [that] [I] didn't feel [like] [I] had [to] [have] everything [. I] guess [it] [was] because , well [, I] had everything when [I] [was] [at] home [but I] _, I don't know_ _why_ [I] didn't . 
B|109| M: [I don't think so .] 
A|110| A: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: Hah , [you're] . Ah . Ah ! Ah . ah . Ahhh . Ahhhh . Ahh . Ahhhhh . Ah , ah . ahh . ah Ah . 
A|112| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|113| M: [I'm] [thinking] [about] making [a] trail [, [but] [I] don't [know] how] . 
A|114| A: [Yes] . _Yeah_ . 
B|115| M: _Yeah , I_ 
A|116| A: [Yeah] . [Yeah _, I] think_ [, [I] mean] [that's] pretty , [that's] [a] pretty important [, uh ,] part [of] [it] there because [that] , [that] [can] [be] [really] expensive [if] [you] ever [have any] health problems . My dad _, I think_ [my] [, I'm] still covered on , [with] [my] dad's [, uh ,] health plan [at] his , where [he] works [, but] [it] would definitely [be] something [to] look into once [I] _get_ [my] own . 
B|117| M: Wait , [how] did [you] [get] [him] [to] sign [with] [the] Giants ? 
A|118| A: [Oh] . 
B|119| M:  ... 
A|120| A: No earthly idea . 
B|121| M: Why ? 
A|122| A: Good . Should _we_ [, uh ,] start this [so] _we_ [can] , 
B|123| M: Not [really] . 
A|124| A: [Yeah , I] liked your idea too , there . 
B|125| M: [I hate] [to be] [that] guy [, but] what's [the story] [with] [the] number [of] murders [in] Dallas ? 
A|126| A: [Yes] . 
B|127| M: We _should_ try again . 
A|128| A: [and] [I] find [that the] health care programs there [, uh ,] [are] administered [with] [, uh ,] [at] least people [I] talk [to] , [with] [, uh ,] [a] great deal [of] integrity [, and] [, uh ,] people [don't] seem [to be] reluctant [to] use [them] [to] [any] degree . 
B|129| M: [you] might [get] [more] thorough , umm , [from] TV 
A|130| A: [I know] [it] [, and] [you] [know] [what] ... 
B|131| M: [You] 
A|132| A: [and] _I think_ [you do] accomplish [more] after [that .] 
B|133| M: [you] . 
A|134| A: Uh [, I] would [say] probably eighty percent [of] [them] [that] [are] caught , they're [from] places [like] [up] [in] Oklahoma [, and] Louisiana , Arkansas [, you] [know ,] across [the] , [the] border . 
B|135| M: [Yeah ,] she's adopted . 
A|136| A: Right . Have [to] [agree with you [,] and] [I'm] kind [of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also [. I just] [don't think] [that] [it] acts [much] [as] [a] deterrent [to] these people because [, uh [,] you] still [see] [them] committing [the same] crimes [, but [,] I] tend [to] [agree with [you] that] [, uh ,] _we_ [should] [have] [it] [I _just] _,_ I don't know_ [that] [it's] [always] effective [but I] guess _we_ [, uh [,] we're] kind [of] stuck [with] _it _._ It's_ [, it's a] difficult [, uh ,] [problem] , isn't [it] , [to] determine [how] [you're] going [to] punish somebody for [a] particular crime [, uh ,] 
B|137| M: He's [a] human translator . 
A|138| A: Uh-huh . 
B|139| M: [That's] back . 
A|140| A: Okay . 
B|141| M: [I know] [you] [are [,] but] [what] [am] [I] ? 
A|142| A: [Yeah , I] find [it] surprising . Because [a lot of] times , [it] , here [, you] [know ,] [I'll] talk [to] [some] people here [and] [I'll] mention someone's , [some] talk host [and] [I'll] expect [them] [to] [have] an opinion on _why_ [I don't] [like] [him] [and] [don't] listen , _they_ [don't] [even] [know [,] you] [know [,] what] [the] [guys] name [is] [, uh] . Bruce Williams who does financial work [all] over [the] United States . Most people haven't heard [of] Bruce Williams . [You] probably haven't either unless [you're] [a] radio buff . 
B|143| M: [I don't think so .] 
A|144| A: [and] [I] spend enough time chatting around everywhere [, you] [know] 
B|145| M:  
A|146| A: [I know] [that's] [how] [I] [am] [about] Xanadu . 
B|147| M: You're 
A|148| A: Something happening [to] [me] [at] Christmas time [that] , [that] verified [to] [me] [that] [I] will 
B|149| M: [Yeah [,] and they] eat [the] tomatoes 
A|150| A: Right . 
B|151| M: Are [you] referring [to] wealth disparity ? 
A|152| A: Uh-huh . [Oh] . 
B|153| M: [Oh] [yeah] ? 
A|154| A: But [, I'm] [sure] [that's] fun . 
B|155| M: [you ,] [you're] 
A|156| A: [Oh ,] [that's] great . 
B|157| M: [I] wouldn't 
A|158| A: Uh-huh . 
B|159| M: [That's] [why] [we] [don't have] [them] . 
A|160| A: [and] [you ,] there [were] [some] places , where people , 
B|161| M: [It's] [just] [a] joke [. It's] [not] [even] funny . 
A|162| A: [Well] [my] husband [is] telling [me] [we] [have to] hit [the] road We're going [to] [go] [to] Commerce [and] [see] [a] friend . [And] , then [I'm] going [to] [go] [to] Sulphur Springs . 
B|163| M: [I'm] sorry [to] hear [that .] 
A|164| A: [Yeah] [but] [you [have] a] rider . 
B|165| M: [It's] [just [,] it's] . 
A|166| A: [Yeah] . 
B|167| M: [Well [,] you] [can] [just] [see] [the] picture [of the] tree ... 
A|168| A: He [just] said burn _it ._
