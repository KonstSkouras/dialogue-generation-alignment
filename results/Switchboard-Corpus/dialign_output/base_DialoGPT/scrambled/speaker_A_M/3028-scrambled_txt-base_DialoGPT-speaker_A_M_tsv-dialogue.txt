A|24| A: A T S ? 
B|25| M:  ... 
A|26| A: _Yeah [._ Well] [it's] _that_ _they_ _I think_ [the] idea _of_ _freedom of_ speech goes _back_ [to] _and_ [I] [uh] [uh] [the] [the] [the] whole aspect _of_ being able [to] display your [uh] your ideas _you_ _know_ [the] _what_ [the] country stands _on_ America stands _on_ _is that_ _they_ _can_ [do] _that_ _Uh_ , though [I] _would_ never even consider [it] _in_ [a] million years [to] _do it_ myself [I] [I] _I think_ [uh] _you_ _know_ [but] [I] [I] _still_ _what_ [the] flag stands [for] _I guess_ [to] me _is that_ if somebody wants [to] voice their opinion or display their opinion openly _and_ if _that_ [is] [a] [a] way _that_ _they_ _can_ show their opinion then _they_ should _be_ allowed [uh] 
B|27| M: It's alright .

B|29| M: Do [you] _have_ _a lot_ [of] plants ? 
A|30| A: _The_ other [thing] then [is] , because [I don't] _know_ [how] long _they_ want us _to talk_ ,

A|34| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . Okay [. Well] [I don't] _know_ any other magazines [I] could _talk_ [to] [you] _about_ . 
B|35| M: [I mean [,] you] [don't] _have_ _to be_ rich [to] _have_ insurance .

B|37| M: _No ,_ _he_ [just] _said that_ _he_ [is] _very good_ [at this] . 
A|38| A: _Yeah ._ _Yeah _._ _And_ _I_ think_ _about_ [how] [it] used [to be] if [you] were doing [a] paper [and] [you] _had_ [to] [go] _back_ [and] retype everything [, and] oh , _it was_ [just] awful . [So] [, um [,] I don't] _know_ _I think _we_ have_ [just] become [really] spoiled . But _I think_ , [it's a] nice kind [of] way [to be] spoiled 
B|39| M: i 
A|40| A: [That's] [how] [I] got _my_ other ones by selling their product [for] _them ._ _They_ [not] only give me [a] demonstrator [, but] [the] hardware as well as [the] software . 
B|41| M: We're _not ._ 
A|42| A: Uh-huh . 
B|43| M: [I] . 
A|44| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . It _would_ [be] handy . 
B|45| M: [The] bank [is] paying [for] _it ._ 
A|46| A: _Yeah ,_ fairly recently [. Well [,] that's] [really] sad . [I] hadn't thought _about_ [that] _in_ [a] long time . 
B|47| M: _Yeah . You_ ? 
A|48| A: Right [, and] actually [it's] probably safer _on_ [, you] _know ,_ [at] long trips because [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|49| M: [Yeah , I] [have] [a] cave [in] [my] [back] yard . 
A|50| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|51| M: [I] _see_ 
A|52| A: _I [said_ that] [, I] could believe [in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but] [I] _would_ [be] , I'd find [it] hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|53| M: [You [know] ,] he's _a big_ guy 
A|54| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . [Yeah ,] or maybe offer _them_ [, you] [know _,] some_ sort [of] an incentive [to] _do it _._ Uh_ [, you] [know] college credit [, you] [know ,] something [, you] [know ,] 
B|55| M: [I'm not] _from_ [the] area , [I'm] _from_ Pittsburgh [, I don't] [have] [a] clue [about] [the] internet [, but] [I'm not] going [to] 
A|56| A: [Yeah .] 
B|57| M: [we] , 
A|58| A: [Yeah ,] I've [, I] live right across [the] street [from] [a] , [a big] lake here [, um ,] [it's] _on_ Oneida lake [and] [I'm] [wondering] if [, uh ,] if she'll want [to] [go] _out_ there [and] [go] swimming next year . [I mean ,] I've got , [the] yard's _all_ fenced [in] [so] she doesn't run loose [, but] [, uh ,] she could [go] [in] sometime when , if [I'm] watching her , 
B|59| M: [Yeah [,] but] what's [the] [point] ? 
A|60| A: Uh-huh . 
B|61| M: [They] [said] [they] [would] [do it .] 
A|62| A: Huh . 
B|63| M: It's [the] same person [, just] different pronouns . 
A|64| A: On A B C ? 
B|65| M: [Yeah [.] Uh] . 
A|66| A: Glaucoma . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| A: _And_ with _all_ [the] , [see] I've got , _on the_ south side [is] _all_ glass [. Well ,] as much as [I] could [get] [in] [it [,] you] _know _._ And_ [, uh ,] [the] east side [is] glass . 
B|69| M: [And] [we] _did_ _they have_ kids ? 
A|70| A: [You] , 
B|71| M: [Yeah [,] some] [of] [them .] 
A|72| A: _I think_ [that's] [a lot] more realistic [. Uh] [, I] [, _I] think_ [that] [we] should [be] spending more time [and] [, and] again [I don't] _think_ [the] , [the] Peace Corps [is] _, is_ as successful now simply because [it's] [not .] It doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|73| M: It's [the] [most] beautiful [thing] ever . 
A|74| A: [So] _what_ kind [do] [you] [, uh ,] [get] ? 
B|75| M: [That's] [what] [I said] . 
A|76| A: [Yeah .] 
B|77| M: Are [you] retired ? 
A|78| A: Uh-huh . 
B|79| M:  
A|80| A: [Well , I] agree , absolutely [, and] [you] [know ,] [it's] _all_ relative , because _I was_ [from] West Texas [, and] _it was_ [very] dry [, and] [so] [I] thought Dallas _was_ awful [, and] [I] _still_ _think_ [so] [, but] then [this] summer [we] went [to] Orlando [for] [a] week [, and] _it was_ [so] humid there [that] your [, um ,] _all_ your windows were were wet every morning . [They] _had_ [to] [get] [the] squeejies [and] clean [them] off . 
B|81| M: [I] [have] [a] potato 
A|82| A: [Yeah .] 
B|83| M: [They] stare [at] [you] 
A|84| A: [Yeah .] [No [,] I] understand [that] totally 
B|85| M: Because [of the] [freedom of] choices [, [I] guess] . 
A|86| A: It [really] [is] [, [I] mean] we're , we're [in] [a] leased town home [, and] [it's] [, uh ,] you're probably , your teeth will probably fall _out_ figuratively speaking , [it's] nine hundred [a] month . 
B|87| M: [I'm not] [sure] . 
A|88| A: Did [he] , [did] [he] actually play [in] [the] Pro Bowl . [I] remember [he] _was_ [like] [a] backup [and] then somebody got injured [and] [he] _was_ supposed [to] [go] . 
B|89| M: [I] eat meat . 
A|90| A: [And] families took care [of] themselves [and] [, um [,] but] now [, you] [know ,] people [don't] , [they] [don't] support each other [that] way . 
B|91| M: Uhh , no [. I'm [not] .] 
A|92| A: _I think_ [so] too [, uh _,] I know_ [the] , [the] group _I was_ [in] [at] [the] time [this] _all_ came up [they] [, uh ,] were quite vocal _about [it_ ,] through electronic mail , boy , [they] [just] [really] [, you] [know] let [them] [have] [it] [from] one end [to the] other , vehemently 
B|93| M: [And [I] was] [, uh [,] uh] 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] 
B|95| M: [I think we] need [to talk] 
A|96| A: My problem [is] [I don't] want [to] wake up another half hour earlier [and] [do] more 
B|97| M: [you] [see] [that] ? 
A|98| A: Uh-huh . 
B|99| M:  ... [how] [about] 
A|100| A: Um . 
B|101| M: What [about _it] ?_ 
A|102| A: Same idea 
B|103| M: Yes [. And] [. You] . [can] . watch . [all] . [of] . [the] . [the] . 
A|104| A: Whoops 
B|105| M: What [is that] ? 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: Oh [, is] _it ?_ 
A|108| A: [And] [they have] [very good] [food] over there . 
B|109| M: You're 
A|110| A: [Yeah .] 
B|111| M: Oh [, I [know] .] It's [a] little ... spicy . 
A|112| A: [Yeah . You] put [in] [, um] 
B|113| M: [And] [we have] [to] move [out] [of] 
A|114| A: [So] [, I don't] [, I don't] even [know] who your favorite team [is] , actually . 
B|115| M: Do [you] [like] _it ?_ 
A|116| A: Uh-huh . 
B|117| M: Because [I'm] [still] alive . 
A|118| A: [Well , [I] mean [,] but] [you] didn't [have] oboe or something with [it ?] 
B|119| M: Hmmm , here's 
A|120| A: All right . Thank [you] . Bye , bye . 
B|121| M: [I] [had] [a] cat . 
A|122| A: Uh-huh . 
B|123| M: [I think [it] was] [on the] last Thursday night . 
A|124| A: [Well ,] well I've enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|125| M: It's ok .
