A|56| A: [I mean] _if I'm_ dying , _if_ [I know] [I'm] dying , [you] [can] experiment on me . 
B|57| M: _And _I_ know [,_ because] [uh _,] I know ._ 
A|58| A: Most everybody I've [been] talking [to] [is] [from Texas] _, but_ [, uh ,] we're _up_ [here] [in] western , northwestern part [of] Pennsylvania . 
B|59| M: The criminal justice system [is] _supposed_

A|66| A: Uh-huh . 
B|67| M:  
A|68| A: [uh ,] some [of] those countries [were] _so_ safe , _it was_ unreal . Singapore [is] _very_ , [supposed] [to] [be] _very_ safe [and ,] [in] _fact_ , Tokyo [, and] _I thought_ Tokyo would [be] dangerous being such [a] huge large city with _so_ _many_ _people_ , 
B|69| M: What [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|70| A: Uh-huh . 
B|71| M: _You_ _could_ [be] . [not] . [not] . 
A|72| A: [Yeah] . 
B|73| M:  
A|74| A: [I know [,] I] _really_ will [do] [that] [the] next [time] [, I] buy [it] too . 
B|75| M: i 
A|76| A: oh , [sure [,] because] _if_ [you] take [it] into [a] service [station] , [they] [want] [to] charge [you] forty _dollars_ _just_ for [, uh ,] freon , which _only_ costs [you] _about_ [three] _dollars_ 
B|77| M: Electric cars . 
A|78| A: [Yeah] . 
B|79| M:  
A|80| A: _Well , I_ _really_ [do] [, [I think] [you] have] [to] budget those things though . 
B|81| M: _Well , [I have_ a] [good] friend _who_ [is a] lawyer [, [and] he] says [that] [he] _can't_ _go_ _back ._ 
A|82| A: [They] , [they] fear being [a] burden _to ,_ [to] [family] members . 
B|83| M: Ummmmm ... [that's] _what I_ call a'bluebonnet ' . 
A|84| A: Oh , yeah , [they] [have] [, uh [,] uh [,] [what] I] [, [what] I] used _to , uh ,_ now [that] [I don't] [go] [to the] grocery store much , [it's] kind [of] moot _, but I_ used [to] _just_ save _up_ [the] ones [that] [I] [got] one [time] [and] then [go] [and] hand them [to] them [the] next [time] [and] use them over [and] over . 
B|85| M: They're both [very] [pretty] . 
A|86| A: [and] [I think] , um , [in] _fact_ , _if_ [I] [had] _to do_ [it] [all] again [I] , [you] [know ,] after [that] , [you] [know ,] [you] never _think of_ [it] [because] [, _I] guess_ [because] [I] paid for [all] [of] my college education myself [, I] never _thought_ _about_ doing [that] [because] [I] [had] [all] these college loans I'd started paying [back .] 
B|87| M: People _are_ _more_ open minded than [ever] _. _Right_ _._ Uh_ _. _Right_ ._ 
A|88| A: Oh . 
B|89| M: [I'm] [not] _even_ [sure] [what] [to do] . 
A|90| A: [I] [like] [it .] 
B|91| M: [I think] [the] best thing [about] [the] benefits [is] [the] availability [of the] benefits . 
A|92| A: [And [I] think you] [can] [do] [that] for _a little_ while _but_ [I'm] , 
B|93| M: [I don't] [really ,] [don't] 
A|94| A: [Right .] Just wasn't socially acceptable . 
B|95| M: Umm _, I'm_ [not] [really] [sure] . 
A|96| A: Is [that] [how] [you] [, I have] never , 
B|97| M: The [only] thing [I] [can] [think of] [is that] [there] _are_ _no_ guns [in the] area . 
A|98| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh [. Right] , _any_ , on [the] street , [no] [, I know .] Uh-huh . [Yeah [,] and] [Texas] [is] [having a] problem [right] now [and] [it's] [, the] [, the] [, the] [, the] [, the] [I [think] that's] [the] [, the] repeat crimes [and] [the] repeat offenders [is] happening down [here] where they're , they're patrol [, the] state patrol board [is] letting _people_ walk [that] [have] done , oh , heinous things [from] [from] killing police officers _to _,_ I mean_ _just_ multiple , [you] [know ,] molestations [to] murders [of] children , _just_ , [you] [know ,] [really] [bad] things [and] they're _get_ , these _people_ [are] getting _out_ [like three] _to five_ years before they're [even] suppose [to] [be] considered , 
B|99| M: Wait ... [what] ? 
A|100| A: [Yeah ,] [that's] true . 
B|101| M: [Well _,] I'm_ going [to , uh [,] I mean] [, uh] ... [I'm] sorry 
A|102| A: [Well , _I] guess_ [I'm] [, uh ,] [more] traditional [in] [that] [I don't] [like] power windows _or_ power locks [, _because] the_ _people_ [that] [I know] [who] [have] them always seem [to] [have] trouble with them . 
B|103| M: [I'm] [from] [the] UK . 
A|104| A: [Right] [, right] , 
B|105| M: [I mean] , [how] [many] games [have] [you] won ? 
A|106| A: Oh , [really] . Oh [, well ,] [that's] [a nice] , [nice] story . Um . 
B|107| M: It's [not] [an] orthodon . It's [a] pallet . 
A|108| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|109| M: [But] [they] [do] . 
A|110| A: That , 
B|111| M: s ... 
A|112| A: Um , hobbies [, I] [like ,] messing around [in] your house building things [, and ,] [you] [know ,] putting cabinets _up_ [, and ,] those kind [of] things , um , 
B|113| M: [Yes .] 
A|114| A: [Well , I have] [the] [three] girls [and] then [we] ended _up_ with four grandsons . 
B|115| M: [That's] [a] [good] point [. _I] just_ wanted [to] point [out] [that] _a lot of_ [people] aren't [even] aware [of the] [fact] [that they] [can] [get] [up] [to five] [dollars] . 
A|116| A: [You] owe [it] [to] yourself 
B|117| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] [what] [you] [mean] . 
A|118| A: [You] [know ,] _if_ someone [is] 
B|119| M: [That's] [a nice] shirt . 
A|120| A: also saves [a lot of] [time] with commercials . 
B|121| M: [I thought] [it was] [because the] majority [is] young , [not] [old] . 
A|122| A: [well] [we] [were] [there] [in the] winter . In [uh ,] January _or_ February [, [I] don't] remember which , 
B|123| M: They're both [just] [the] same 
A|124| A: Watch me . 
B|125| M: [I'm] [not] going [to] lie . She's [not] going [back] [to] work . 
A|126| A: Uh-huh . 
B|127| M: [I think] [it's] [bad] [, because] [it's] [not] [even] [bad] . 
A|128| A: [And] [, uh [,] I'm] [sure] [you have [a] lot of] [students] [there] [, uh [,] and] [a lot of] researchers _so_ [you] , [you] may [have a] , [you] [know ,] perhaps _a little_ better economic climate _, but_ , [in] [all] your cities now , [it] seems [like] [there] [is a] , [a] crowd [that's] [really] effected by [this] bill . 
B|129| M: [he] smiles [and] shrugs 
A|130| A: Huh . 
B|131| M: [We] [do] 
A|132| A: [But] [, uh _,] but_ [, uh ,] certainly before [that] , [there] [were] [people] [that] , [you] [know ,] would graduate [from] high school [and] [could] barely read [. [Uh] [,] and] [that's] [just] sort [of] inexcusable [and] [you] [can't] [really [,] I] [, I] [, I mean] [I just] [can't] [even] picture [how] [that] [could] happen . [You] [know ,] except maybe [to] someone whose , [you] [know ,] [really] badly learning [, uh ,] disabled _or_ something . 
B|133| M: [I guess] [so] . 
A|134| A: [Yeah [,] what's] amazing [is] some [of] them [have been] on death row for [a] number [of] years . 
B|135| M: Ok , bye . 
A|136| A: It [is] , [it's] aerobics _but_ [it's] with dance steps . 
B|137| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] [if I'm] [a little] bit biased [or] [not] [, but [I] don't] see [any] difference .
