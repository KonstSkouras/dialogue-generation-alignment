B|33| M: _He's_ [from] Dallas , Texas . 
A|34| A: [So , uh _,] we_ play _that_ [a lot of] them _, and , uh _,_ we_ _like to go_ miniature golfing _and_ [to] movies .

A|52| A: _No ._ 
B|53| M: Haha !!! 
A|54| A: [Oh] , yeah . [I] _, I think_ [it's] [a] wonderful [thing] _to do_ . _And_ there's [a lot] , there's [a lot] more [, I] guess another possible solution _is ,_ since taxpayers aren't going [to] start paying more money _for_ this _and _,_ and_ other budgets aren't going _to be_ cut [to] pay _for_ [it] [, uh ,] more _of the_ volunteer network service . 
B|55| M: [I like [it] .]

B|65| M: Why [is] [it] _so_ painful ? 
A|66| A: Uh-huh . Back when [they] were [in] Saint Louis ? 
B|67| M: Why [is] [the] air _so_ cold ? 
A|68| A: Would _be ,_ _would_ , might _be_ _really_ useful _. Uh _,_ and_ if _it's [,_ you know [,] uh ,] _just_ [people] helping [people] _I think_ makes , makes [the] community [so] much happier . 
B|69| M: [But] ... [but] ... _your_ _garden_ ? 
A|70| A: [Well [,] but] , actually _my_ hobbies [is] mostly [is] _my_ sports . Tennis [, I] play tennis .

A|72| A: Uh-huh . [The] Really ? Okay . 
B|73| M: Yup [. Uh [, I] think] [so] 
A|74| A: [my] understanding [of] how _it was_ framed [is] _that_ [you] this [the thing] [about] this country [is] _that_ [you] can disagree with its government _and_ [you] can display _that_ . 
B|75| M: [Yeah [.] [It's] a] part [of a] game . 
A|76| A: _and ,_ boy once _that_ happened , there _was_ _just_ no way _that_ [I] could _ever_ _go_ _back_ [to] _doing_ anything [of] length _of the_ typewriter .
