A|76| A: [like] for drugs , for drugs [they] , [they] enforce [the] death penalty for [that] [. Uh] , [they're] just , very , very tough , [and] [I guess] maybe _that's_ [the] way Tokyo [is] [too] , or Japan [is] [too] . They're just very tough on criminals . 
B|77| M:  ... 
A|78| A: [So] [, but] yeah , [it] [, it's] interesting , [and] [I] enjoy gardening . My son does [the] mowing [of] [the] grass .
