A|0| A: And _that _,_ I_ _had_ two internal , one _, yeah ,_ two internal plane flights _and a_ couple _of_ other things _. It was_ _really ,_ 
B|1| M: We _are_ _the_ universe _, it_ _is_ us . 
A|2| A: And , _course_ _, that's_ kind _of_ _like_ _a_ cancer _in_ an apartment complex . _You_ start letting _that_ happen _and_ _they_ _go_ _down_ _and then_ _before_ _you know it_ _you_ _have_ drugs _and _a_ lot_ _of_ other things _so_ _, uh _,_ I'm_ _sure_ _that_ aggravates [it] also . 
B|3| M: _I don't_ [really] [know] _what_ [you] _mean_ by _that ._ 
A|4| A: Yeah . 
B|5| M: _But_ [then] _how_ _would_ [you know _it] was the_ cat ? 
A|6| A: Yeah . And _so_ [I don't] _like to_ arrive , or , or when _they_ arrive , _for_ _me_ _to be_ completely worn _out_ . 
B|7| M: My dog's _name_ _is_ beagle _. He_ passed _away_ . 
A|8| A: um _, it's_ _really _,_ I mean_ _, and_ _, _and_ it's_ hard _to_ sell [the] properties . People from J C Penney's from New York , came _here_ _about_ _a_ couple _of_ years ago . 
B|9| M: There _are_ _some_ places _where_ [it's] _not_ [that] expensive _, and I_ live [in] Japan . 
A|10| A: Um _, I_ forget [how] _she_ _got_ [it] _, but [it_ was] , um [, [it] was _the] same_ kind _of a_ deal _I think_ _she_ _got_ [it] _, I think_ _she _was_ a_ psych major [and] _she_ _got_ [it] from [the] psych department . 
B|11| M: [You] [don't] . 
A|12| A: Deer spaghetti [is] real _good ._ 
B|13| M: Uhh [, I think] [you] might _have the_ wrong person [here] . 
A|14| A: [But] he jumped [in] , _in the_ , [the] river . 
B|15| M: _No [, I_ mean] [like] [I] _get_ [to] _work_ 7 _days_ [a] week _, and then_ _I can't_ _work_ 7 . 5 _days_ [a] month . 
A|16| A: Uh-huh 
B|17| M: [I'm] sorry . 
A|18| A: [and I] thought [that] [was] _, you know ,_ _very_ interesting [and _I] [,_ I] [would] [have] thought _of_ [that] earlier [I] _probably_ [would] [have] done _, you know ,_ _just_ [like] , [is] _that ,_ [is] _this_ , [is] [that] [the] Mormon church , [that] _does_ [that] ? 
B|19| M:  ... 
A|20| A: [and] _we_ caught , [the] individuals _got_ caught _, we_ _, uh _,_ we_ went through [the] court system [and] all [that] sort _of_ _thing_ 
B|21| M: _No [,_ _that's] not_ _what_ happened . 
A|22| A: [But] [, that's] _been_ _, it's_ _been_ fun [, I mean] _it's _a_ lot_ _of_ [work] [to] _see_ [that] she's prepared _but_ [it's] _been_ fun _, it's_ _been_ fun [, I] _feel_ [like] _I've_ learned _a lot_ _about_ [the] piano . _I've_ learned _a lot_ _about_ playing [the] piano . 
B|23| M: _He_ _had a_ pet dog _, a_ pet rabbit _, a_ dog [and a] dog 
A|24| A: [I'm] from Atlanta . 
B|25| M:  
A|26| A: Like [, I] remember [a] friend _of_ mine _at_ [work] telling _me_ [that] _at_ his frat [in] college [that] _they_ [had a] tank _of_ piranha [, and] _, uh _,_ you know ,_ used [to] drop mice [in] 
B|27| M: The east Texas school [of] engineering has _a very_ large enrollment . 
A|28| A: Uh _, yeah ,_ maybe people [are] [a] little [, a] little _more_ _, uh ,_ free [to] express their opinions , socially free . 
B|29| M: [You] [are] . 
A|30| A: Uh-huh . 
B|31| M: _They_ _don't _think_ it_ [be] [like] [it] _is [,_ but it] _do ._ 
A|32| A: Uh , 
B|33| M: [I] [was] _there , you_ _can_ [see] [me] . 
A|34| A: _Oh , yeah ,_ he _did_ , he _did_ _. It was_ [it was] [really] [a] shame . 
B|35| M: _What_ 
A|36| A: _yeah_ . Uh-huh . 
B|37| M: uuhh , uuhh . 
A|38| A: Who makes [that] _car ?_ 
B|39| M: Not ahem 
A|40| A: _Well [,_ that's] , _That's_ , um , pampering [the] , [the] petals 
B|41| M: [Well _,] this_ [is] old . 
A|42| A: Uh , [not] _too_ much . Uh [, I] _got_ _a bit_ . Actually , 
B|43| M: _I know it ._ [I'm] [a] lawyer . 
A|44| A: [Well] [that's] okay . _I guess_ [it's] an easy _thing_ _to [do_ .] _So_ _you're_ [you] _have a_ big , _do you_ _have a_ rural house or [what] _do you_ [have] ? 
B|45| M: _What_ [are] [the] features [of a] small [car ?] 
A|46| A: Thirty , or thirty-two _for_ [really] _good_ tickets . See , _they_ , _they_ sectioned [it] _out_ even _more_ . [They] used [to] _just_ [have] [like] _, uh ,_ first [of] all [it was] all one price . And [then] _they_ sectioned [it] _out_ [to] end zone [and then] everything else . And now _they're_ sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] , from one twenty yard line [to] [the] other one , _just_ on [the] lower levels [is] [the] highest price [, and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] _same_ area [but] above [it] on [the] upper level [, and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . And [then] _they're_ [some] sections kind [of] _in the_ corner areas [, and then] [the] cheapest [of] _course_ [is] going _to be_ [the] end , [the] direct end zones _. But_ , um , _they_ [have] _about_ four or five different prices now , [that] _they're_ structuring [it] with [, but] obviously _yeah ,_ _they're_ all going up , _more_ or less [is] [what] [it's] going _to [do_ .] 
B|47| M: [So] ? 
A|48| A: [but] , um , [some] [of] these people [are] _just_ _out_ [and] _out_ brutal . _I ,_ [some] _of the_ cases _I've_ heard _about_ over [the] years , 
B|49| M: [You] _can't_ . 
A|50| A: Yeah . Yeah . _That's_ kind [of a] , _let down ._ 
B|51| M: We [have [a] lot] [more] murders than _you ._ 
A|52| A: And _go_ _out_ [and] spend [it .] And , um _, it's just_ unreal . [I mean] _, I don't_ [like] credit cards [, I] wish [that] _they_ [would] come up with [some] other way [to] _, you know ,_ [the] only way [you] could use them [is] _if_ [you] were , [like] on vacation . [They] [would] _let_ [you] use [it] maybe once [a] year . _You _know_ [, I_ mean] , [of] _course_ [, _I] guess_ [some] people _go_ _out_ [and] spend their _whole_ entire limit on _it like that_ _at_ [that] time [but] , um [, I] [have] _seen_ _so_ many people [and I] [have a] friend right now _she_ _just_ _got_ off [of] thirteen . _She_ _got_ _, uh , [I_ can't] remember [what] _she_ called [it] _, it's_ [some] kind [of] , maybe [it's] _sure_ or something _like _that_ _,_ it's_ something _, it's_ [some] weird [name] [of a] credit card , 
B|53| M: She's [probably] thinking [about] [it .] 
A|54| A: Okay [I] wasn't _sure ._ Most _of the_ ones _, you know ,_ up north [and] everything _do , but_ , um , anyway _, it's_ _, uh _,_ it's_ pretty , also pretty typical _for the_ area . Most [of] [this] area [was] developed [, this] house [was] built [in] seventy-four . 
B|55| M: _He_ [got] elected [, but] [I think] [it's [a] bit] [of a] stretch [to] call _him_ [the] president . 
A|56| A: In other words _you're_ saying _that , you_ [have] [to] find _out_ whether [it's] premeditated or [what] [the] circumstances were . 
B|57| M: [I] 
A|58| A: _That's_ interesting . Uh-huh . 
B|59| M: _most _of_ it_ ? 
A|60| A: [But] , _in the_ house itself , _I've_ _been_ working inside _, you know ,_ these , these many months 
B|61| M:  ... [let down .] 
A|62| A: And _, uh ,_ 
B|63| M: Uhh _, what_ ? 
A|64| A: And _we_ [got] [a] few _, you know _,_ we_ put up [some] hummingbird feeders [and] [some] bird feeders . 
B|65| M: He's [not] interested [in the] drums . 
A|66| A: Yeah . Yeah _, we_ _, uh ,_ _we've_ [got] _, you know ,_ I'll store all our Christmas stuff [and] whatever else junk up _there ._ 
B|67| M: _It's_ [the] [whole] _point_ [of the] article . 
A|68| A: [it's] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . _You _know_ ,_ all these things . [I mean] _, you know ,_ _we've_ gone through [this] over [and] over again . 
B|69| M: [Oh] _my_ god . 
A|70| A: Uh-huh . 
B|71| M: [I'm] ... [not] [sure .] 
A|72| A: And _, uh [,_ what] _we_ _did_ [was] _just_ _, uh ,_ decide [how] _we_ [had] _been_ spending our money _before_ , 
B|73| M: Uhh _, that's _a_ very_ [good] _point_ . 
A|74| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|75| M: [But] ... [it's] [not] [a] soup . 
A|76| A: Um _, yeah [,_ _I] guess_ [that's not] an easy solution . There's , there's no easy solution _for_ [that .] 
B|77| M: _What_ [do you] [like [to] do] ? 
A|78| A: Uh huh . 
B|79| M: i 
A|80| A: _I don't _think_ I_ [would] _go_ through [that] expense . One other benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [, I] [really] enjoyed because _they_ [had] [what] [was] called flex schedule [where] [I] could _go_ [and I] could [work] _, uh ,_ nine hour [days] [and] [have] [like] Friday only [work] four hours 
B|81| M: We [like] Arbys . 
A|82| A: _Oh [,_ you] lucky _thing_ . 
B|83| M: Uhuh . uhuh . Uuhuhuh . 
A|84| A: Exactly . Exactly . 
B|85| M: Is [that] [good] ? 
A|86| A: Uh-huh . 
B|87| M: _What_ [did] [they] say ? 
A|88| A: [Well] well , who , who else [is] going [to do] [this] , _then ?_ 
B|89| M: [It [was] a] joke 
A|90| A: Yeah _, you know ,_ _if_ [you] [get] [a] sweet strawberry _they're_ much _better_ [, but] _if_ [you] [get] [a] sour strawberry , 
B|91| M: _It's_ still [a lot] [better] than [the] community . 
A|92| A: [What] _, uh_ [what] [do you] _feel_ [are] important _to you_ or other people as , as crucial benefits ? 
B|93| M: [I think] everyone [here] [would] [feel] [the same] _if they_ touched 
A|94| A: Remember [that] ? 
B|95| M: Heh [, I] love [it .] 
A|96| A: Uh-huh . 
B|97| M:  ... 
A|98| A: right . Yeah . 
B|99| M: _I [know_ [,] it's just] ... [I don't] [know [, I] don't] [really] [know] . 
A|100| A: [I] [see] . 
B|101| M: What's [the] _point_ [of] having [a] bank [then ?] 
A|102| A: Yes . Right , [that] [would] [be] [the] intent [of [it] .] 
B|103| M: [You] . 
A|104| A: _Oh [,_ that's] _great_ . 
B|105| M:  ... 
A|106| A: [I mean] , he lives all [in] [that] [same] area going from Mount Lebanon , um [, it's] real pretty up _there _._ It's just_ , 
B|107| M: [I] am . 
A|108| A: Yeah , oh [, but] , boy [you] try [get] into _that ,_ you'd [really] open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|109| M: [I'm] [not] . 
A|110| A: Uh-huh , there's [a lot] _, yeah ,_ [lot] [of] hidden taxes . 
B|111| M: _No_ [. But] [do you] talk [to] your parents [about] [it] ? 
A|112| A: [I] [can] believe [that _.] _Well_ , it's_ [, it's] _been_ interesting . 
B|113| M: That sounds [really] cool . 
A|114| A: Yeah [, it] [, [it] was] pretty [good] [, it] _, uh ,_ sometimes [I] [like] [a] dramatization [, and I] [like] _, uh ,_ U S A , when [they] [had] their _, uh _,_ uh ,_ mystery movies [and] things , their made _for_ T V movies 
B|115| M: [I [,] and] 
A|116| A: Okay , 
B|117| M: _I've never_ [seen] [it like that] [before] . How [is] [it] ? 
A|118| A: Yeah , _the cats_ [do] [it] [in] [there , you] pull [it] [and] take [it] _out_ [and] throw [it] [away] [, and] [that's] [it] , 
B|119| M: [That's] [what] [I'm] trying [to [do] , but] [I don't] want [to be] [a] bad guy . 
A|120| A: Uh-huh . 
B|121| M: _I know_ . 
A|122| A: [No [, _I] don't] _think_ so_ either . 
B|123| M: _I know_ [it's] crazy [, I'm] [a] vet tech . 
A|124| A: Yeah . 
B|125| M:  
A|126| A: Bye-bye . 
B|127| M: [Well [,] we] play [in [the] same] [course] . 
A|128| A: _It's just_ _, so_ _, it's [a_ lot] [of] [work] , _too_ 
B|129| M: [Well [, it's] a] [good] [thing] [I'm] [here] [, I'm] [just] gonna [be] alone [for] [a] while 
A|130| A: Wow . 
B|131| M: Uhm [. Well] ... [I guess] [I'm] gonna [go] hang _out [in_ the] bathroom . 
A|132| A: Sure . [You] [got] [to] inspect [it] _, yeah_ . 
B|133| M:  ... [what] 
A|134| A: [Well] _I , uh _,_ uh , [I_ know it .] 
B|135| M: [you] 
A|136| A: [Well _,] you know ,_ [if] , [if they] [have] time enough [they] [can] , stay off [of [it] .] 
B|137| M: Do [you] play classical flutes ? 
A|138| A: Good . 
B|139| M: [What] [does] [it] taste [like] ? 
A|140| A: Right . 
B|141| M: [Oh ,] [she was] ... [I] [was] 
A|142| A: And who , [how] [about] _you ?_ 
B|143| M: Hehe [. It [was] a] [good] day . 
A|144| A: Yeah . [I] wish we'd , 
B|145| M: [I don't think] [I'm] gonna [be] able [to] drive _home_ [for the] rest [of the] night . 
A|146| A: [Oh] . 
B|147| M: [You know] [what] ? 
A|148| A: [Oh ,] [just] our own design . 
B|149| M: [I'm] sorry [, I don't] understand . 
A|150| A: [Well ,] [the] , [course] [in] our particular state _, uh [,_ _we] [have_ the] prison overcrowding , whatever _, so_ _they're_ giving [the] early release _, uh ,_ 
B|151| M: [I'm] [not] [sure] [, but] [I know] [we have] [, so] [we've] [been] [really _,] really_ fortunate . 
A|152| A: [Oh [,] that's] exciting . Yeah . 
B|153| M: [She] [was] already [there .] 
A|154| A: Yeah . 
B|155| M: You're assuming [that .] 
A|156| A: Uh-huh , uh-huh . And [what] kinds [of] things [do you] use [it] [for] when [you] when [you] [go] [to] their houses [to] them ? 
B|157| M:  
A|158| A: Uh-huh . Sure . Would [, it] [would] , [It] [would] [be] [just] futile . 
B|159| M: [I'm] [in] Georgia . 
A|160| A: [Well [,] that's a] full time job .

B|173| M: Uhhh ... [I] don 
A|174| A: [Oh [,] really] ? [Oh] . [You] [really] rough [it] [then] . 
B|175| M: [Oh , yeah [,] it] 
A|176| A: Course [it] doesn't always [work] [out in] their favor . 
B|177| M: [Oh ,] Debor 
A|178| A: [But] _, uh [,_ you know ,] [my] [home] [is _,] uh ,_ fairly simple [. It's] designed [to be] added on [to] . 
B|179| M: [But] ... [they're] [not] . 
A|180| A: [You [know] , [I] [,] I] [really] agree with [you .] Um [, _I] , uh ,_ though [I've never] done [that] myself [, [I] [,] I'm] , [was a] basically an education major when [I] graduated from college [and I] accepted [a] job [that] [at] [the] time [was] [just] slightly above [the] poverty level [to] teach [to] , um , [very] rural children [in] [a very] low income district [and I] spent [a] year teaching [there] 
B|181| M: [It's] [not] [really] [that] complicated .
