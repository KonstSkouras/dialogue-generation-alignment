B|31| M: [Well ,] it's _always_ _been_ [the] song [that] he listens [to] . 
A|32| B: Right _, and_ [the] , probably [the] biggest _problem_ down there [is] _that's_ [where] [the] , _that's_ [the] drug entry points , 
B|33| M: _You_ . 
A|34| B: _and_ most kids these days [have] gotten themselves into _, uh ,_ financial situations , [where] [they] [have] _to be_ working all [the] time .

B|49| M:  
A|50| B: But , um , they're kind [of] old older 
B|51| M: [It's a] bank , _so_ [it] _has_ [to be] [a] bank . 
A|52| B: Uh-huh . 
B|53| M: [It's] [not] . 
A|54| B: Uh-huh . What's [so] sad [about] this [is] both [of] [the] , [the] [man] [and] [the] woman had _a degree_ having [to] [do] with computers _but_ , their training isn't what [we] need [in] this country .

B|63| M: [So] , who _do you_ _mean_ ? 
A|64| B: Yeah . 
B|65| M: Why _do you_ [think] _they are_ [a] [problem] ? 
A|66| B: Some baby-sitting groups , again [, [I] know] [it] sounds [like] [a] rationalization [, but I] really [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early on [are] around lots [of] [other] children [and] [they] [, they] learn [to] share .

B|77| M:  ... [because] [, uh , uh] . 
A|78| B: But [, I] [mean] , [that's] [going] [to] tend [to] [, I] [mean] [it] seems [to] me [that] sort [of] approach will tend [to] simply make [the] cost [of] committing [the] crime slightly higher [in] [other] words , you've increased [the] probability [of] somebody being caught [a] little bit . [The] real question [is] [how] [do you] convince people [not] [to] commit such crimes [in the] first place .
