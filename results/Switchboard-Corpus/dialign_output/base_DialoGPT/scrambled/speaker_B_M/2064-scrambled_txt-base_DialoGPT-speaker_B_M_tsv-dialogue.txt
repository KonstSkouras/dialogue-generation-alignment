B|35| M: It's weird .

A|38| B: [I] _know_ [a] guy [that] upgrades _, uh ,_ _for a_ reasonable cost . 
B|39| M: _Right_ .

A|46| B: _Yeah _, I_ would_ guess so . 
B|47| M: [Because it's] [not] fair 
A|48| B: Uh-huh . 
B|49| M: [Yeah [,] but] they're also [the] ones who read [the] articles . 
A|50| B: Ugh , ugh . 
B|51| M: Uhhh , talk [to] _me_ [, you know .] 
A|52| B: [Yeah] . 
B|53| M:  
A|54| B: [I think] [in] [and] _it_ , [just] _would_ depend upon [the] circumstances [and] [, and] [the] extent _of the_ abuse [and] [, and] _if_ another alternative [was] available . 
B|55| M: She shrugs . [I've] [been] [in] [a] relationship [for a] [while] . 
A|56| B: They're both females ? 
B|57| M: [I think] [you] [are] thinking [of the] NCAA [, the] [one] [that] [is] responsible _for the_ NCAA's drug 
A|58| B: [but] _, uh _,_ _I_ think it's a_ good idea because [a] lot [of] people _still_ want [to] drive [the] older cars which [you] [can't] blame them [for] [that] 
B|59| M: [Yeah ,] [true] 
A|60| B: _They_ , [on] [I think] _it_ [was] Romain Drive or Romain Street or something , there [in] Los Angeles , [they] used [to] _have a_ , or _, I_ guess [they] _still_ _do_ _, uh ,_ _had a_ _, uh _,_ uh ,_ [big] warehouse kind [of] [thing] , which _had_ offices [and] _it_ [was] sort [of] nondescript [for a] _, uh [,_ you _know] ,_ [for the] size [of the] company which , inside [was] basically [a] store house [of] [a] bunch [of] stuff _he_ collected _, he_ _, he was_ _, uh ,_ [a] great collector [of] everything _, he_ _, he_ _, he_ did [not] _, he_ did [not] throw anything [away] [and] _, uh ,_ supposedly _this_ guy _had_ , _had_ [been] breaking there [for] _he was a_ , [like] [, you _know] ,_ burglar , _had_ [been] breaking there awhile [and] _, uh ,_ _And_ _had_ ended up , 
B|61| M: [They] could [, but I] don'know [if] [it's] possible . 
A|62| B: _And_ keep _it_ clean . [I think] that's [I] [pretty] good idea . _And_ [I think] [, you _know] ,_ again [I've] seen [a] lot [of] young kids doing [that] [and] [I think] _it_ gets them prepared [to] , [to] learn how [to] volunteer as [they] [get] older . [I] [know] [I] did [, you _know] ,_ [in] Girl Scouts [and] everything [and] after [that] [in] high school _I would_ volunteer at [a] nursing home [and] stuff _like that_ 
B|63| M:  ? 
A|64| B: _The_ [thing] _I don't like_ about dogs sometimes [is] [that] [the] house will [just] reek , [of the] dogs [, and] constantly . 
B|65| M: [I've never] [been] [to [the] [,] uh] ,, _country_ 
A|66| B: [Right] , _right ._ Uh-huh . 
B|67| M: pox . anyways 
A|68| B: Uh , [just] _, uh [,_ the] distance involved [and] , 
B|69| M: [your] [right .] 
A|70| B: [and] _it_ [just] _, uh ,_ immediately heats up . [So] , that's [one] [thing] [I] miss about living up north , as [I] remember , um [, you _know] [,_ the] long Springs [and] long Falls [and] [the] cooler weather . [It was] really nice . 
B|71| M: _We_ [are] [never] cheering [for the] Broncos . 
A|72| B: [Yeah _,] yeah_ . _Well ,_ To some extent [if] [they] _would_ _do_ something with some [of] those people . But [that] seems [to be] [a] good [way to] [get] [off] [for a] lot [of] them [too] . 
B|73| M: [I don't _like] the_ humidity 
A|74| B: Uh-huh . 
B|75| M: [Well [,] [he was] a] man [of] _many_ talents . 
A|76| B: [Yeah ,] exactly . [I] [like] things _that , you _know_ ,_ two people [can] _do_ [, but I] [like the] quiet [of] doing things [away] [, you _know] ,_ kind [of] gives [you] some space [for] yourself [, and] that's [what] [I] find [in] making [the] dolls [and] things , [that] _it_ gives [me] something [that] [I] [can] create [, and] [I] [like] [to] crochet [and] knit . [I] made some afghans [and] [that] kind [of] stuff . [I] [like] doing things with my hands . 
B|77| M: [I] 
A|78| B: She'll [be] two [in] July . 
B|79| M: [I think it's a] [thing] . 
A|80| B: Uh-huh . [We] _had_ watched _it_ _, uh _,_ I_ guess Sunday night [and] Monday night [, but] [we] didn't [get] [to] watch _it_ tonight . 
B|81| M: [The] youngest [one is] [the] oldest [one .] 
A|82| B: Midnight . 
B|83| M: 500 
A|84| B: Uh-huh . 
B|85| M: [You know [,] you] [just] say [, uh ,] [it's] cool [, I'm not] [like [that] , you know] ? 
A|86| B: yes _, I_ _do_ . 
B|87| M: [Yeah , I] [mean ,] [it's [a] real] [, uh ,] [place .] 
A|88| B: [and] [I] [was] disappointed [when] [I] went [to] Texas . [I] didn't see [that] [many] [of] them . 
B|89| M: How [much] does [the] government pay [you] ? 
A|90| B: [Yeah] . 
B|91| M: [If] [the] military [is] [in] favor [of the] law , then _they should be_ [in] 
A|92| B: Uh-huh . 
B|93| M: [Well [,] yeah] [, but] [if I] [had a] gun [, I would] [still] [have] [it .] 
A|94| B: Uh , that's , came out around [the] first [of the] year . 
B|95| M: [Well [,] we] [have a] camp . 
A|96| B: [I] [, I] [like the] idea [that [,] uh ,] [if] someone [is] from [a] foreign [country] [, and] [they] come [to] _this_ [country] [and] [uh ,] commit , [a] crime [, [I] think] [that] irregardless [of] whether [they] [have] already become [a] citizen or anything , [they should be] immediately deported . 
B|97| M:  . 
A|98| B: Have [you] ever [had [a] car] with [an] air bag ? 
B|99| M: What [do] [you] [mean] ? 
A|100| B: Uh-huh . 
B|101| M: [I] [never] thought I'd [be] [in the] minority [on] [this] [one] [, but I'm] [still] [a] [big] fan [of the] program . 
A|102| B: [So] [we] put [a] three [car] garage [in] . 
B|103| M: What [is] [the] average amount [of] money [you] make ? 
A|104| B: [and] he's [like] glued at [the] T V . 
B|105| M: [And] 
A|106| B: Um , [like] , [like] Europe , um , England . [I] [know] [the] taxes [are a] lot higher .
