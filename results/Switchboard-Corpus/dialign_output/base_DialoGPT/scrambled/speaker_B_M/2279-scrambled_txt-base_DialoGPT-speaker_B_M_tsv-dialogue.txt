A|80| B: Uh-huh . 
B|81| M:  ... 
A|82| B: _Yeah ,_ well [if you] could call [it] [a] benefit [that] C M U [, I] mean [the] other [thing] [that they] allow [you] [to do] here while [you] [are] working [is] , [is] consult [for] , um _, you_ [know] , other companies . 
B|83| M: The worst [thing] [is] [that] [it's not a] legal _thing ._ 
A|84| B: [and] [, uh ,] she [was] , she did [not] _want_ [any] part [of] swimming [but] she liked [to] , [to] [get] _in the_ pool on [the] first step . She'd [just] [get] on [the] first step [and] lay down [. _You] know_ _in the_ summertime when [it's] _really_ , _really_ hot . 
B|85| M: Ah [, yeah ,] [I'm] gonna try [it] _. I don't know_ [what] [I'm] [doing] [right] now [, but] ... 
A|86| B: _Yeah_ . But , 
B|87| M: Does [it] [have to go to] trial ? 
A|88| B: It will [be] . 
B|89| M: [I] guess [you] can't . 
A|90| B: [I don't] [, [I don't] know] [that] [you] could require everyone [to] , [do that] [for] [, yeah ,] [to do] [it] [for] [a] whole year , or two years or something _like_ [that] , 
B|91| M: [I think] [you're] paying [the] _wrong_ [amount] [of] taxes .

A|104| B: Once [you think] _about_ [it] , huh . Uh-huh . 
B|105| M: [Yeah [,] but] [it's] [a] [very] different [situation .] 
A|106| B: Some [of the] crimes [are] [just] [so] brutal [and] [so] _, you_ [know] , useless . This may seem [to be] _the best_ [way] [out] [. [I don't know] .]

B|111| M: [I , I] [have] [, [I ,] I] [like] [it] 
A|112| B: [what] does [that] mean [for] [people] [that] [you] work [with] [and] shake hands [with] [and] 
B|113| M:  [, yeah] ? yes 
A|114| B: Getting [in] [, yeah] .

A|124| B: Absolutely . [Yes] [, I] wish [I] had [the] answer [for] [that] , everybody does . 
B|125| M: They're [all [the] best] , [so] [that's] [all] [that] matters . 
A|126| B: Uh-huh . 
B|127| M: There's [a] T [I] clone [in the] box [that's the] [same] _thing ._ 
A|128| B: [And] she'd [just] lay there on [that] step [and] [just] [, you] [know] , [cool] off 
B|129| M: [I'm] pretty sure [that's the] case [for] _most_ [of the] [stuff] I've tried . 
A|130| B: [Yeah] . 
B|131| M: [I'm] [a] vegetarian . 
A|132| B: Uh-huh . [Yeah] . [Well] [the] [thing] I'd [be] [most] likely [to] attach [the] death penalty [to] [is] [the] violence [. I] mean [, [I] can] handle [people] , [people] selling drugs [, you] [know] [, it's] [, it's] [wrong] [, but] [it] [, [it's] not] worth somebody getting executed [for] . But we hear [so] much [about the] violence [and] how [it's not] safe [to] walk [the] streets because somebody [, you] [know] , these random drive by shootings [and] [that] sort [of] [thing .] 
B|133| M: [I] [have [a] lot of] [family] [that] lives [in] Minneapolis , [so] [I'm not] [going [to] be] able [to] rent [a] [house] .
