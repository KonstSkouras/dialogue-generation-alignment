A|72| B: Uh-huh 
B|73| M: _Well , I_ came [in] [from] [a] _dead_ [family] , [so] _I'm not sure_ [if] [that's] [how] [it] works . 
A|74| B: [Yeah] . 
B|75| M: How [would] [you] react 
A|76| B: And [so] [it's] almost impossible [to] [, it's not] fair [to] [a] pet [to] _have a_ pet here , or certainly , certainly [not [a] dog] , 
B|77| M: [Yes] ... 
A|78| B: Wow . [That's] nice . [That's] real nice .

B|89| M: [That's] funny [, we] [never] ever cheer against [the] Broncos . 
A|90| B: [and] [, uh [,] [I] was] up [there] last weekend [, and there] [are] trees that , that still _have_ their leaves [on] [, and] they're green _, but_ they're [dead] [You know , the] [, the] freeze [just] got them . [They] , they weren't ready _for it_ [at] [all] apparently [, and] [, and] [we] haven't had [a] typical fall [at] [all] [. Not] much color [, you] [know ,] changes _have_ occurred [at] [all] .

A|94| B: Uh-huh . 
B|95| M: [So] camping [and] canoe ? 
A|96| B: [Yeah] .

A|98| B: _I'll_ let [you] lead out . 
B|99| M: Yea , [I'll] [have a] better word [for it] 
A|100| B: [Well , I] [I'm a] physician . [Uh] [and] , [as] [is] _my_ husband . 
B|101| M: [I think] [it's] going [to be] [a good] 
A|102| B: A [lot of] them had [to] [have] elected [not] [to] do [so .] Now [I don't] [know [,] what] they do [in] place [of [it] .] [You know ,] maybe [it's] life [in] prisonment or [, you] [know ,] something [, I] [I don't] [know] [how] they handle [it] [I was] surprised [to] learn that [so] few countries [have] capital punishment . 
B|103| M: It's [not] [my] favorite [, but] [I'm] [pretty] [sure] [it's] [my] favorite . 
A|104| B: [Yeah] . 
B|105| M: Why [would] anyone [go] [to] DC ? 
A|106| B: Only [in] America [is] [there] [a dog] called [a] German Shepherd . 
B|107| M: [Uh] huh .
