B|71| M: [I _think] that's_ cute . 
A|72| B: _You_ too . 
B|73| M: _I [know_ ,] uhh 
A|74| B: You're kidding ! [No] kidding ! Uh-huh . 
B|75| M:  
A|76| B: Yeah _, _I_ don't think_ _we_ , 
B|77| M: [That is] [what] [I] [get] [for] [trying to] understand [the] question . 
A|78| B: [Well] flower gardens . [I] [like] [to] _have_ , [matter of] fact _this_ past weekend [I] _just_ got finished planting [a] bunch [of] tulips [and] daffodil bulbs . [So] , those ought [to] be coming up around spring [time] 
B|79| M: [You] [know] 
A|80| B: [Well [,] uh ,] say , embezzlement , right . [You] [get] [a] guy down [the] street who comes up [, uh ,] carrying [a] 
B|81| M: _I know_ . _The_ majority [do] 
A|82| B: _Oh ,_ no , no , no . Someone [has] _been_ lying [to] [you] . [What] _they_ use [is] roast beef . 
B|83| M: [You] [know , the] locals [have] _a lot of_ [people that] live [in the] city . 
A|84| B: Yeah , there's one very close [to] [where] my parents [are] [but] _, uh , [I_ think] [it] would be nice [but] my dad's [the] type [he] wouldn't want [to] spend [the] money [on] anything . 
B|85| M: Are [you] 
A|86| B: Um , all [of] his direct descendants , descendants [have] now died [and] [the] grandchildren [are] [in] their seventies [and] eighties . 
B|87| M: [I , you] , _you're_ [, [you] [are] , you] ... 
A|88| B: Your right _, [I_ _do] ,_ too _, [I_ think] _they_ start out young , [like] [in] [, uh ,] Girl Scouts [and] Boy Scouts [a] video doing 
B|89| M: [I mean] , we've _had_ [some] [stuff like that] _, but_ [we're [not] really] [the] most common _kind of_ [people] . 
A|90| B: We [have] _just_ [had] [that] law _, [I_ think] , about [a] year , maybe [a] year [and] [a] half [here] [in] Texas 
B|91| M: [I'm] good , thanks . 
A|92| B: [I] see . 
B|93| M: [I] . 
A|94| B: [I] [only] [have] one other person [I know] [in] my [, in] my group [here] [that] works [where] [the] wife stays home , [and] [that's] because [of] religious values as _well_ [. They're] Baptists [and] _they_ , [and] _they_ [think that's] important . 
B|95| M: [I'm] [a] bit [tired] _, but_ [I'm] going [to do] [a] little vacation [in the] beach . 
A|96| B: Uh-huh . 
B|97| M:  
A|98| B: Uh-huh . 
B|99| M: Uuhhh uhuh . Uhuhuhuh 
A|100| B: _Yes_ . 
B|101| M: [I [think] that's] _it ._ 
A|102| B: Right . [Well [,] the] [reason] [why] _we_ play over there [is] because its [where] , since _we_ [are] [a] Garland resident , _they_ gave us [a] special deal [where] [you] [can] [get] [, uh ,] ten rounds [of] golf [for] [a] hundred dollars [, yeah] , [a] hundred dollars cause [it] [is] half price [what] [the] normal green fees [are] . 
B|103| M: [you] , 
A|104| B: [and] somebody will find [a] way [to] make money [at] [it .] 
B|105| M: [Yes] , yea [. That's] 
A|106| B: Yeah [, in] their [own] community , right . Yeah [, that's] true Most [of them] probably wouldn't [do] something [like that] . Although there [are] [a lot of] kids who would [do] [it] _just_ [to get] away from their parents 
B|107| M: German shepherd 
A|108| B: Bye . 
B|109| M: We're always [here] , _you're_ [just] [not] . 
A|110| B: Now , [that] [was] [the] assumption [that] [you] spent [that] same dollar [for] every , [for] every item [on] there even though there's [, uh ,] taxes [on] different things . 
B|111| M: _Is_ [it] large ? 
A|112| B: [Yes] . 
B|113| M: [I [,] uh , I] don t [know] . 
A|114| B: Two hours [where] ? 
B|115| M: [well [,] we] [do ,] we've [been] [in] texas before 
A|116| B: [And] [, uh ,] kids [kind of] , _they_ want [the] , _they_ want [the] fun part [and] [not] [the] , [not] [the] work . 
B|117| M: [I don't [think] you] understand [the] point [of] [this] post 
A|118| B: Uh-huh . 
B|119| M: [I] 
A|120| B: _they_ [don't] [get] out [of] [the] house , _they_ [don't] socialize [but] [it's] my home [and [I] don't] want [to] leave [it .] 
B|121| M: Are [they] yours ? 
A|122| B: Uh-huh [, yeah] [, yeah] . 
B|123| M: This . 
A|124| B: [And] [not] _being_ cared [for] . 
B|125| M: [Oh [,] [I] [know] , I] [was] [just] wondering . 
A|126| B: [The] thing [, the] other thing [is the] [, [I] don't] [like the] rain either . 
B|127| M: [yes .] 
A|128| B: [it] , [it] [can] [still] show up [and it] [can] [still] flag as [a] positive [and] , [and] those kinds [of] things obviously [that's not] [the] intent , 
B|129| M: Ohhh ... [well] [then] . 
A|130| B: [Is] [that] right ? [Oh ,] neat , 
B|131| M: [You] [don't] [have] [to] [like] [it .] 
A|132| B: [and] [so] . [I] found [that] [really] helps . 
B|133| M: [I] 
A|134| B: [So] [, uh [,] but] [I think] there [are] [some] wonderful child care opportunities out there [for] children [but] , [and] [we] all [know] [the] [kind of] things [that] [you're] supposed [to] look [for] . [I think] , 
B|135| M: [You] [know what] ? [I'll] stop [being] [a] tool .
