A|14| B: Oh , they _do_ great . [I] put mine _in_ probably _in_ November . 
B|15| M: [I] don't _know ._ 
A|16| B: [I] get tired [, uh ,] sometimes , mowing , because we mow [, you know ,] _a_ good bit [of] ground around [the] house area . 
B|17| M: [I] can't tell _if you're_ talking _about_ _me_ _or_ _the guy_ . 
A|18| B: Yeah . Like _in_ may case _, I have_ three children *spelling: 'may' should _be_ 'my' from ages nine _to_ two . _And ,_ it's _just_ unfeasible for [me] _to_ try _to_ get _a_ job because all [the] money [that] [I] would , _be_ making would _be_ going _to_ day care . 
B|19| M: Hmmmm 
A|20| B: Yeah [, the] only consolation is so many [of] [the] murders are [, you know [,] the [,] the] violent people going against each other and so they [, you know ,] society's [not] going _to_ put them _to_ death , well at least maybe [the guy] they cross next _time_ is going _to_ . [Uh _,] [I_ think] _, [I_ think] capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for [the] kind [of] people where we _say_ [, you know ,] this sort [of] person is _just_ [not] acceptable _to_ our society and we are there by going _to_ remove them from society , [not] temporarily _, but_ permanently . 
B|21| M: Is [the] GX clone [a] clone ? 
A|22| B: sometimes they _do_ put them _in_ [, uh ,] fairly low paying situations . 
B|23| M: [I] agree . She _can_ still learn [to] _type_ . 
A|24| B: and they _have_ one at ten . 
B|25| M: You've gone .

B|27| M: [I] don't [have] [the] right [to] [say] [that .] 
A|28| B: But we _, but_ we live [about] ten miles from probably three [or] four , [not] large towns _but_ [, you know ,] reasonable . 
B|29| M: [I think] . 
A|30| B: Oh , well [, that's] nice . 
B|31| M:  ... 
A|32| B: Cause I've been [, uh ,] especially _in_ large corporations . [You] [can] really [, you know ,] wind up getting , having [, you know ,] real problems I've found out . I've worked for [a] few [, you know ,] several thousand plus [, you know ,] [type] companies . _And_ _it ,_ and especially [if you're] doing _like_ professional work . Where [you know ,] it's kind [of] ethereal _as_ [to] what [you're] doing [you [know] .] 
B|33| M: Didn't [it] [used to] [be] [the] same [time] [as] [the] second episode [of] season 2 ? 
A|34| B: Huh . 
B|35| M: You're right [, I] was [just] thinking [of] [it] [in] [a] different way . 
A|36| B: and I've been drug tested three times and [I know] many people [that] [have] never been tested [in] their lifetime and [the] company [I] work for is sixty thousand people , plus . So see _I ,_ for some reason , I've come up three times . That's pretty high statistics . 
B|37| M: [I [,] [I] [,] I] [like] plants . 
A|38| B: But [you] probably pay more percentage wise [in] other taxes . 
B|39| M:  ... he's Jewish . 
A|40| B: It's [a] legal job [, you know] 
B|41| M: No . 
A|42| B: Yeah . I'll bet they're involved . Yeah . 
B|43| M: I'd throw [it [,] but] [I] don't [think] [you] [can] throw [a] . 
A|44| B: [yeah] , [that] would [be] even [, yeah] [, I] didn't even , [think] [about] [that .] 
B|45| M:  
A|46| B: I've , I've never I've never even been called [to] jury duty . 
B|47| M: [I [know] [,] I have] no idea 
A|48| B: Yeah . 
B|49| M: [And ,] 
A|50| B: Yeah [, I] _do_ too . 
B|51| M: Uuh , why ? 
A|52| B: [Uh [,] yeah] , 
B|53| M: [you] 
A|54| B: [Well ,] we're [about] [a] hundred miles from Pittsburgh north . 
B|55| M: [I] don't [know .] 
A|56| B: We [have] [, uh [,] uh ,] four rooms downstairs , and [a] pantry 
B|57| M: [I think] [of] course 
A|58| B: Yeah . 
B|59| M: What [do] [you] mean ? 
A|60| B: [but] beyond [that] [, uh ,] lately I've been reading , I've always liked [the] NEW YORKER .
