A|58| B: _Yeah [, yeah_ .] 
B|59| M: [They're] everywhere . 
A|60| B: [I'm not] saying [they're] all [bad] [, but [I] think] [people] _who_ [are] _guilty of_ really serious heinous crimes , do [not] deserve [to] [be] cared [for] _for the_ rest [of] their lives . 
B|61| M: _Do [you_ think] [the] government [is] [more] responsible [for the] poor [than] [the] poor ? 
A|62| B: Or [if] , [if] [they] could [be] real , real nearby where [they] could [see] them everyday _or_ [so] . 
B|63| M:  
A|64| B: [they] [, they] charged [you] [by] , [by] weight [of] how much trash [you] were actually sending [to] [a] land fill . 
B|65| M: [I] guess [they] [can] [just] build [a] new [one] [with] _a few_ [more] [people] . 
A|66| B: Right . 
B|67| M: [well [,] [we] are] [the] [best] team [in the] league .

A|70| B: [but] [, uh , yeah] 
B|71| M:  
A|72| B: But then _, you know [,_ it's] kind [of] [like] [a] , [a] lottery . Somebody [in] their lifetime may win millions [of] dollars where another person doesn't win anything [, and] tries [and] tries [and] tries . [You] _know ._
