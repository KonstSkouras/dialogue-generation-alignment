B|65| M: A . 
A|66| B: [Oh _,] yeah_ . [Well ,] most [of] my camping [, I] haven't done much since _I [was_ a] kid [but] [, uh ,] we'd , basically , take [the] tent up [in the] Sierras [and] [, uh ,] usually just camp near some stream or some lake . 
B|67| M: You're 
A|68| B: Um . 
B|69| M: Huh [. I] did _not_ [know that .] 
A|70| B: _Well [, I_ mean] , were [there] witnesses ? 
B|71| M: A Honda [, uh ,] Mercedes ? 
A|72| B: [Oh ,] oh , [that] sounds wonderful . 
B|73| M: [Do you have] [any] 
A|74| B: Uh-huh . 
B|75| M: [I was] thinking [of] [a] [different] scenario . 
A|76| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|77| M: It's [a] _small_ town . 
A|78| B: [Uh _,] no_ , [not] actually 
B|79| M: h 
A|80| B: [And] they're very dedicated to [that [,] and] [, uh [,] it's] [been] really wonderful . _It_ helps [you] hang onto your roots . 
B|81| M:  ... 
A|82| B: [Oh ,] [okay] . [Do] , [do they] play [like] [, uh ,] [like] does [the] eight year old play baseball ? 
B|83| M: [Do [you have] a] cat ? 
A|84| B: But [they do] [have] socialized medicine [and] things [like] [that .] 
B|85| M: [Well _, I] think_ everyone [is] [in] [on the] joke . 
A|86| B: He , 
B|87| M:  
A|88| B: Yeah [, it] [, uh ,] moving to [this] area , [of] course [it] happens everywhere [, but] [, uh [, I] guess] we're [pretty] naive coming from [small] towns [, uh ,] [in the] midwest [and] then [, uh ,] moving to [a] larger city where [there are] drive-by shootings [and] [, uh ,] [there] seems [like] killing [for] _no_ reason at [all] [, and] [, uh .] 
B|89| M: [It] . 
A|90| B: Yeah [, that's] _true ._ 
B|91| M: Ohhhh [, yeah [,] uh [,] no] . 
A|92| B: Yeah . 
B|93| M: The appeal 
A|94| B: Yeah , [right] , [right] , 
B|95| M: It's [a] joke , [because] [the] United [states] [is] [in the] middle _of the_ list . 
A|96| B: Yeah , he's [not that] far , he [was] sort [of] [in] between Strasbourg [, and] Paris . 
B|97| M:  
A|98| B: [So] [I [,] [I] [,] [I] [,] you know [,] it is] [a] problem . [And] [, but] as [you] pointed out [, [I] [,] I think] [the] real problem [is] [the] low pay child facilities [and] [that] [is] sometimes [what] some women who [have] to work , [that] [is] [all] [they] [can] afford . When our children were very young [, we] had [a] pay , [a] live [in] paid baby-sitter [that] [was] wonderful . 
B|99| M: We , 
A|100| B: Yeah [, yeah] . 
B|101| M: It's [not] [true .] 
A|102| B: [and] [I guess] [it] has [a] thatcher attachment to [it .] 
B|103| M: That's [a] _little_ [different] . 
A|104| B: [Well , it's] [, uh [,] it's] really both . [I'm] certainly driven [by] [the] desire to maintain my weight [and] [be] healthy [and] [be] [in] shape [, and] [, uh [,] and] most [of the] time [I] enjoy [it .] Sometimes [I don't] [, but] [I] feel [that [,] uh ,] [that the] discipline [it] affords me when [I] [do] [it] when [I don't] want to [is] also worth something . 
B|105| M: nots 
A|106| B: Uh-huh . Um [, I] see . 
B|107| M: Why [are] [you] [so] awesome ? 
A|108| B: [I think] one [of the] problems with , with education as [it] relates to [this] [, though] , [is that] [I don't [know] that] education [is] prepared to help [people] make those changes . [It] just seems [a lot [of] the] training [and] education [that] goes [on] [is] gearing [people] towards [a] profession [and] [not] giving them [the] skills [and] whatever those skills [are] necessary to make those job changes , which [I think] [is] going to [be a] hard thing [for] , [for] [people] to face . 
B|109| M: What [about] [you] ? 
A|110| B: We're [in] Sherman . 
B|111| M:  ... 
A|112| B: [You [know] ,] she loves everybody . [And] [little] kids [can] just [, you know ,] maul [all] over her , 
B|113| M: Awwwwwwwww nursing homes .
