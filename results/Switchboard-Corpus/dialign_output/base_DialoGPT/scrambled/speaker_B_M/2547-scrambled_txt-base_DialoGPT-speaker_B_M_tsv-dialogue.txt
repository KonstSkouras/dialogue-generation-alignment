B|55| M:  
A|56| B: [So] _I ,_ [like] _I've_ picked up now [a] subscription [to] _one of the_ travel agent [, uh ,] organization magazines [and] _it's a_ ridiculous difference when [you] start reading from their perspective . Uh _, _you_ [know_ ,] their major interest [is] [in] commissions [and] _, _you_ [know_ ,] there's very little talk [about] [the] quality [of] places _or_ airlines .

B|57| M: [I'm not] [sure] [if] _this is_ [a] joke _or not_ , [but] [I'm] pretty [sure] [it is] . 
A|58| B: Pretty _good_ trip _. So what do you_ , _what_ kind [of] hobbies [are] [you] [in] ? 
B|59| M: He nods [. So what do you] [want] ? 
A|60| B: [Oh ,] yeah _, you_ [see] _all_ these [people] , yeah , these stately [people] , [and] _well_ dressed [people] out walking their dogs [with] their plastic bag [or] their piece [of] paper _for them_ _, it's_ really kind [of] funny . 
B|61| M: [I] . 
A|62| B: You're kidding . 
B|63| M: [I'm not] [good] [at] typing . 
A|64| B: And stuff [like] [that] . And _so ,_ um , 
B|65| M: [I] [don't] [know ,] [but] _I can_ tell [you] [that] [they're] [all] over [the] place [in the] ghetto . 
A|66| B: Uh-huh . 
B|67| M: _You_ [have] [to] admit _it _,_ that_ [is] [one of the] most adorable _things_ [I've] [ever] seen . 
A|68| B: _Um ._ 
B|69| M: _You know_ [what] ? 
A|70| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|71| M:  ... [I] [don't] [get] [it] . 
A|72| B: [Oh] okay _, you_ [get] [so] attached [to] _them_ . 
B|73| M: _It's_ [been] 
A|74| B: [But] _, _you_ [know_ ,] our , [like] [in] our church , [it ,] [it is] , your free _to do_ [that] [or not] 
B|75| M: [Do [you] know] [what] [the] number [of murders] per capita [in] Texas [is] ? 
A|76| B: [It's] incentive , speaking [of] Bush _, we're_ going [to] [get] [a] little off topic [but] speaking [of] Bush , [they] [that] [had] [a] story where [he] went [to] visit some little [, uh ,] elementary school students , [and] stuff . 
B|77| M: [I ,] 
A|78| B: [I think] [uh _,] well_ [in] your words , [they] were [a] little bit too liberal . 
B|79| M: [It's] . [like] . [the] . every . _year ._ _year ._ 
A|80| B: [I] [a] [or] , [or] foreign cars actually . Uh , 
B|81| M: i 
A|82| B: [It's] [, that] [was] [one of the] first [things] [I] made [for] _my_ husband , [because] [I was] [like] , um , yeah 
B|83| M: He's [an] old man . 
A|84| B: And [, uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are] , [are] guys [that] [are] _, [you_ know] going [to] [get] caught anyways [but] , There's always [a] few [of] those [people] [that] [are] _, [you_ [know] ,] lost their head [or] whatever . 
B|85| M: [I think] [I] might [be] able [to] find [them] [in the] _back_ [of] [my] mind [if] _I look_ around . 
A|86| B: [But] [if] [I'm] going _to be_ traveling [in] [that] [car] [for] any period [of] time [, I] [want] some real [good] classical music . 
B|87| M: [I'm not] [sure] [if] [you] [are] saying [that ,] [but] [it's] [not] [that I] [don't want [to] be] murdered [, I'm] saying [I] [would] rather [be] rehabilitated . 
A|88| B: [Oh] . [Oh ,] [that's] nice [, [I] ,] [this is] different [for] us [because [the] other] , [in the] past we've [had] homes [that] haven't [had] any [side] walks , [and] , um _, it's_ [been] [a] little more [country] [with] [the] trees , [and] [we] [do] miss [that] . _Um_ , [if] [we] [had] [a] chance [to] move [, [I] think] we'd move [back] [to] somewhere [that] [was] [a] little more countrified [and a] little less maintenance required [as] , [as] far [as] [that] goes . 
B|89| M: We're _still_ [here] [, we're] [just] waiting [for them] [to be] found . 
A|90| B: yeah . 
B|91| M: I'd [say] [the] Pensaclippers [are] [the] most expensive team [in the] _state_ . 
A|92| B: That's , [that's] [what] [, [I] like] _doing_ [things] [like] making lasagna [just] [because] [I can] [have] [it] ready [and] baking [in the] oven , 
B|93| M: [So] [, uh ,] [how] [do you] [do] [it] ? 
A|94| B: [But] [, uh ,] [do you] [ever] watch CHEERS ? 
B|95| M: [I] [don't] [think] [it's] bad . [It's] [a] plant [, so] [it's a] tree . 
A|96| B: Uh-huh . 
B|97| M: [Oh [,] well] [I've] _got_ [a lot] [to do] [and] [I'm not] [sure what] [to] [think] [of] [it] 
A|98| B: [I] really [like] those , [in] fact [, [I] had] [a] harpsichord played [at] [my] wedding . 
B|99| M: [Oh [,] you] [have] _money_ 
A|100| B: And boy [that] thing screams now . 
B|101| M: [Um .] huh . 
A|102| B: [You know ,] [they're] [not] going [to] sit there [and] lose [money] . If [they are] losing [money] , then [they're] going [to] raise rates . 
B|103| M: [You] 
A|104| B: _Well ,_ who's [the] running , [is] [it] Sammy Smith , [or] [is] [it ,] Emmett Smith . 
B|105| M: [I] [don't] . 
A|106| B: [Um] [, [I] [,] [I] [,] [I] think] [we] pay too much . And [I've] [, [I] look] [at] [my] paycheck [and] [I] make [, well] , let's [see .] They take out [in] [state] [and] federal taxes 
B|107| M: [Yeah .] He says . 
A|108| B: [Oh ,] [they] did ? 
B|109| M: [I] mean [, it's] [not] expensive . 
A|110| B: [Oh ,] okay . You're going [to] Commerce ? 
B|111| M: [Well [,] it's] [not] [like] [they're] [doing] anything . 
A|112| B: [Yeah .] 
B|113| M: Wait [, so [,] uh ,] she's [a] dog ? 
A|114| B: [Yeah] , [we] [still] [got] some from last [year .]
