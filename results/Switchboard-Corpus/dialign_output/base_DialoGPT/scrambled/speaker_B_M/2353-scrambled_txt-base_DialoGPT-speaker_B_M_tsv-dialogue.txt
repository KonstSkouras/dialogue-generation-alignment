B|73| M: [I'm] sorry [, but] [I think] we're [all] [out of] ideas _here_ . 
A|74| B: Um , _well ,_ see [, I'm] [a] school principal . 
B|75| M: [You] [, uh [,] you're] [a] genius . 
A|76| B: Uh-huh . Although lately [I have] noticed [, you know ,] even [if] [I] gain , [like] two pounds [, I] start [, I] start feeling [it] _and ,_ 
B|77| M: This 
A|78| B: Always [want to] go [to] _Canada_ _Canada_ [to] Banff or somewhere [like] [that] 
B|79| M: [I think] [you] mean [that's] [what] _happened_ [with] [the] Germans . 
A|80| B: [I'm] [going to] switch [from] those yellow legal pads , then . 
B|81| M: It's [a] bit scary . 
A|82| B: Uh-huh . 
B|83| M: [I'm] paying . 
A|84| B: Chili . 
B|85| M: What [are] [they] can [, and] [are] 
A|86| B: Uh-huh Uh [, yeah] _. I'm_ [, [I] am] [, uh [,] I] go [to] [the] Church [of] Christ . [I have] been raised [in the] Church [of] Christ _and [,_ uh , but] [, uh [,] I] [, uh ,] too _many_ times [you] hear [you] hear _a lot_ [about] [what] _what you're_ [, uh ,] supposed [you're] supposed [to] look your Sunday [best] [uh [,] uh [,] and] dress [and] proper attire 
B|87| M: [I'm] sorry [, but] [you're] being [a] [little] ... 
A|88| B: That's [a good] idea . 
B|89| M: How [do] [I] _get_ [the] _answers_ _to my_ questions ? 
A|90| B: Uh-huh . 
B|91| M: _I guess_ [you] _could_ [say] [they] [were] [a] ... [well ,] poor person . 
A|92| B: [Yeah [,] I think] , [well ,] [it's] , [it's] definitely [a] problem [, and] [I think] [it] [could] [get] worse . 
B|93| M: How [, I'm] 
A|94| B: Right . Right . 
B|95| M: [They] [would be] mad at [you] [if] [you] [did .] 
A|96| B: Right . That's [a] , [that's] [a] common problem though . That [it] seems , [that] has [happened] [in] Dallas as [well] as New York [and] [I] [try to] recycle [all] [of the] newspapers [that] come [to my] house [and] after [a] while [I just] quit taking [the] newspaper because [I] couldn't recycle [it] anymore which isn't [good] for business on [the] other end either [, I] suppose . 
B|97| M: [I'm] [not] saying [it's] impossible [, I'm] [just] saying [it] [is] . 
A|98| B: Now why [would] [you] go [to] [a] seafood restaurant [to] eat chicken ? 
B|99| M: Uuhhh [. I'm] [not] [sure] [what you're] trying [to] [say] . 
A|100| B: [Yeah [,] you] [can't] enjoy [it .] Right . 
B|101| M: Why [do you] [think] [they] [have] [so] [many] problems ? 
A|102| B: [Yeah] . 
B|103| M: What's [up] [with] [Canada] ? 
A|104| B: That [should] [get] [you] close enough [to _,] to be_ able [to] find [it .] [I think] [it's] [, uh ,] probably listed [in the] restaurants [, you know] . 
B|105| M: [You] [, uh , you] 
A|106| B: [you know ,] [of] course [there's] [still] _a lot of_ work [to be] done [, and] then when [you] [get] [it] completely [, you know [,] the] shell finished [, uh , you] [still] [have _a] lot of_ stuff [to do] inside [, but] [, uh ,] 
B|107| M:  . 
A|108| B: [And] home porting [was a] possibility [a] few years ago . 
B|109| M: No [. I'm] [just] saying [they] [had] [a lot of] opportunities . 
A|110| B: It seems [to be] catching on [, uh ,] slowly [but] surely [, [I] guess] 
B|111| M: [and [,] [to] [,] [you] [,] to be] . 
A|112| B: [And] [so] we've [got] plenty [of] time [to] go , because down [here] [in] Houston , [it's] [, uh [,] the] lines [are] long . 
B|113| M: [So] . 
A|114| B: [Well ,] there [is] [a] [guy] [in] Dallas , [that's] [all] he does . 
B|115| M:  
A|116| B: [You can't] [get] them , give them [, the] , oh [, you know ,] Cabbage Patch [answers] [and] stuff . 
B|117| M: Uhhh [, we] , 
A|118| B: [Yeah [,] yeah] .
