A|5| A: [Okay] , well , _there's_ _, uh ,_ it's kind _of_ an interesting topic [and] one _that_ _I think_ _is_ quite fascinating because _, uh ,_ couple _of_ years ago _, I_ guess _, uh ,_ _not_ very , _not_ very long ago , seemed like _the_ whole world , _not_ just _the_ United States , but _the_ whole world _was_ kind _of_ _in a_ standstill where everyone _was_ basically _in _, uh_ ,_ _you _know_ _,_ a_ very comfortable position , _so_ _to_ say , even though _the , the_ cold war _was_ , _was_ _in_ full swing . _You know ,_ [you] _had_ _the , the_ Russians against _the_ Americans _, the_ Communists against _the_ Free World , [and] _in _the_ last_ couple _of_ years _things_ _have_ _changed_ dramatically , _not_ only _on the_ political front but also _on the_ economic front , where _, uh ,_ couple _of_ years ago _we had_ _, uh ,_ America _was_ one _of_ _the_ leading powers [and] one _of_ _the_ strongest nations _in the_ world as far as economics _were_ concerned , [and] now we're having _a_ very tough _time_ _in a_ recessionary period . We're also _have_ _a_ very humongous trade deficit , [and] _, uh ,_ [and] _that's_ kind _of_ frightening . Also , _you _know_ _,_ a_ couple _of_ years ago , ten , fifteen , ten , fifteen years ago , an individual _going_ into _a_ career could expect _to have_ _that_ career basically throughout their whole life , [and] thirty years ago _, _that_ was_ _, _that_ was_ basically _it ,_ whereas now we're expected _to have_ _a_ career change every , _you _know_ ,_ every couple _of_ years [and] possibly four _to_ five career _changes_ throughout _our_ lifetime , [and] _so_ _I think_ _, uh ,_ _you _know_ ,_ _things_ , _there's_ been an awful _lot of_ social change lately , [and] [and] _, uh_ . 
B|6| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|7| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|8| M: And [, uh] [uh [,] I] don't [know _,] I ,_ I'm [not] sure _how_ [that] can be [changed] . 
A|9| A: True . 
B|10| M: [You know _,] I ,_ I'm [, I] [know] _that , uh_ [you know] [there's] _a lot of_ [things] [that] we've done [, uh] 
A|11| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|12| M: If you're [not] interested [in] [it _,] that's_ fine . 
A|13| A: Yes , yes . 
B|14| M: And [I] don't [know _,] I , I_ don'v , I'm [, I] am [a] [, I] [was] raised [in a] family , 
A|15| A: True , true . 
B|16| M: And _I think that's_ probably [the] most significant . 
A|17| A: [Uh-huh .] _Well ,_ _do_ , _do_ [you] [think that's] _good_ or bad ? 
B|18| M: Uh [, [I] think] _that , uh [,_ I] [do] [think] [that] [the , the] job market [and] [the [,] uh] job market [changes] _are_ [going] [to] be big strides [in _,] [in_ , uh] ... 
A|19| A: [You] [think that's] great . 
B|20| M: _Yeah , [I_ think] [it] [is] . 
A|21| A: That's some _, yeah_ , because [a lot of] _people_ seem [to] stagnate once they get into position , they , they're very comfortable , they lose [the] ability [to] learn , [and] they [in a] sense become unteachable . [They] [think] they [know] [all] _there_ [is] [to] [know] _in the_ area , set path , [and] [you [know] ,] come [in] [and] put _my_ _time_ [in] from nine [to] five , [and] when [that's] over _with_ [, that's] [, that's] [it ,] without even giving [a] second thought [to] , advancing their education or getting extracurricular , um , education , [and] , [and] [I think that's] an excellent opportunity for us [to] expand ourselves also . 
B|22| M: Uh-uh . 
A|23| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right] . [I] agree _with_ [that [,] I] agree _with_ [that] . [But] [I] believe [that , uh ,] an individual should really learn [how] [to] , [to] learn 
B|24| M: [Well [,] [I] think] [so] too . 
A|25| A: learn [how] [to] adapt , learn [how] [to] grow _in [the_ [,] in] their college or whatever education they might take . [Well _,] [that_ [,] that's] _good_ [, that's] _good ._ 
B|26| M: _Yeah [,_ that] [is] [, that] would be [good .] Uh [, I] don t remember [the last] [time] [I] [had] any trouble [with] [my] [, uh] [my] wife , [we had] [a] [, a] [, uh] [a] [, [the] last] [, uh] child [that was] born [on the] first [of] September [was] born [in] January [the] same day [that] [we] [were] [going] [to have] [our] tax bill passed . 
A|27| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [I] mean , [there] _are_ [a lot] [, [a] lot] more [people] [in the] public school system than [in the] private school system . 
A|29| A: [Yeah [, I] , I] read [a] few articles off [in the] newspaper [and] some publications where stress [, uh ,] for those [people] [that] [are] laid off [and] also for those [people] [that] [are] [not] laid off but [were] threatened [with] [a] layoff [and] threatened [with] [a] reduction [in] their company [is] extremely high right now . 
B|30| M: Oh [, yeah] . 
A|31| A: [That] stress [is] [a] very prominent factor [in the] [work] [place] [and] [it] affects ,
