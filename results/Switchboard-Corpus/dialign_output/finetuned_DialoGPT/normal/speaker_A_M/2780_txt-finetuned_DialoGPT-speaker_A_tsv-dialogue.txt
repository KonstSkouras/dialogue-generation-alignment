B|0| M: _Yeah ._ Uh-hue . 
A|1| A: So , _it_ _really_ _is_ _a_ different , um , 
B|2| M: _Well_ _I think that_ _, uh you know _I_ think_ _, _I_ think_ _a lot_ _of_ _people_ _are_ more _, uh_ _I think_ more concerned _with_ _their_ safety than _with_ _, you_ , talking _about_ _the_ safety _of_ _their_ kids _, _I_ mean ,_ _I'm_ not _a _,_ I don't _know_ _,_ I_ _was_ raised _in a_ Baltimore _, I_ grew _up_ _in_ _, uh_ 
A|3| A: _Yeah _,_ that's _,_ that's_ _right_ talk _to_ [, I] had _to_ talk [about] gun control [with] somebody _and I_ talked [with] [a] woman who actually _, you know ,_ had _just_ purchased [a] gun [that] day _, and_ [was] going target shooting _, you know ,_ 
B|4| M: _Right ._ 
A|5| A: _and_ _it was_ very different _it was a_ whole , different view .

A|13| A: _Yeah ,_ isn't _it_ funny . 
B|14| M: _Uh ,_ _yeah_ [, _I] mean ,_ _I'm_ sure _a lot_ _of_ [people] _, uh_ [, _I] know_ _a lot_ _, uh_ _a lot_ more [people] , _a lot_ less than [I] [do] _, uh_ 
A|15| A: _Uh-huh ._

B|20| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue . 
A|21| A: You [have] [the] seven day waiting period . 
B|22| M: _Right ._ 
A|23| A: [Yeah] 
B|24| M: Oh [, that's _,] uh_ , 
A|25| A: [that's] [uh] [that's] 
B|26| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: [Yeah .] 
B|28| M: _And_ _, uh_ [, I] don , _I'm_ not [too] sure [that] [, _that's] the_ main difference between [the] N [I] S A [and] [the] other newspapers .

B|38| M: [I _know] ._ 
A|39| A: It's only because [they] [make] [a] big stink over _it ._ But [I] [I guess] actually [I] believe [that if] somebody wants [to] burn _the flag_ [I guess] [that's] [their] opportunity They're [they're] [they're] [right] [in the] sense [of] _freedom of speech_ But [I] _would_ _never_ 
B|40| M: _Right ._ 
A|41| A: [Yeah .] 
B|42| M: [I] _, _I don't know_ [._ I] , [I'm] not [really] [for] _it . I_ don [, _I] mean [,_ [I] think] [, I] , 
A|43| A: [Yeah .] [Well] [it's] [that] [they] [I think] [the] idea [of] _freedom of speech_ goes back [to] [and I] _uh uh_ [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] being _able to_ display your [uh] your ideas [you know] [the] [what the] country stands [on] America stands [on] _is_ [that] [they] can [do] [that] [Uh ,] though [I] _would_ _never_ even consider [it] [in a] million years [to] [do] [it] myself [I] [I] [I think] [uh you know] _but_ [I] [I] still [what _the] flag_ stands [for] [I guess] [to] _me_ _is_ [that if] somebody wants [to] voice [their] opinion or display [their] opinion openly [and] [if] [that] _is_ [a] [a] _way_ [that] [they] can show [their] opinion then [they [should] be] allowed [uh] 
B|44| M: [Yeah ,] [yeah] . 
A|45| A: Unless [the] burn unless [the] actual fire hinders somebody's health [and] well-being [you know] _but_ [I] _I think that's_ [I guess] [that's] [I] [that's] [my] opinion _Yeah [I_ guess] [you] feel differently . 
B|46| M: [Yeah _I] don't_ [, I] don [, I] [, [I] think] _, uh_ _, uh_ [I] don'member [the] _, the_ _burning_ [of [the] flag ,] 
A|47| A: [Uh ,] no _but_ _I think that's_ [that's] [uh] [it's] [that's] taxpayer's money . If somebody buys [their] own [flag] [and] [and] burns [it] [that's] fine _but_ [that] [that's] [you know] [that's] destruction [and] [of] [uh] public property [and] whatever . 
B|48| M: [Well] [, [that's] true] . 
A|49| A: _No_ [I don't [know] [I] guess] [the] symbolism oh [I think] [what] America stands [for] _is_ [the right _to] _be_ able to_ disagree [with] _the government_ . 
B|50| M: _Right ._ 
A|51| A: [Uh] _I think that's_ what's made democracy 
B|52| M: [Yeah .] 
A|53| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] [Well] [that's] [that's true] 
B|54| M: [Uh ,] 
A|55| A: [Yeah] But [I think] [I] [I] [Yeah I] [I] [I guess] [the] idea [you know] [they] _always_ keep [saying] like [the] framers . Um . [there] [uh] _one_ [of the] Republican [the] appointees [for] [the] [the] judicial bench [and] [they] _always_ talk [about] [they] feel [that] this person believes [in the] framing [of the] constitution [what the] original framers [the] ideals [the] original framers set down . 
B|56| M: Uh-hue 
A|57| A: [And] Um [I] believe _that the_ idea [of] [burning] [the flag] _is_ _is_ [in] 
B|58| M: [Uh ,] [what] [do _you] think [of_ the] Civil War ? 
A|59| A: [my] understanding [of] how _it was_ framed _is_ [that] [you] this [the] _thing_ [about] this country _is_ [that] [you] can disagree [with] its _government_ [and] [you] can display _that ._ 
B|60| M: [Yeah .] 
A|61| A: [Uh , I] [Yeah [,] I] [and] [and] [so] [that] [as] [a] _freedom of_ expression [and] _speech_ [and] whatever [I] [I think that] [that's] viable . Um [as] long [as] [it's] your [flag] [and] [and] you've made your your _point . [I_ think] . [Yeah] Because , realistically , like [for you] [for you] [you] _don't think_ [it's] [right] 
B|62| M: _No _,_ I don't_ [. I] donno [. _I] mean [,_ I] [, [I] think] [it would] [be] good [if] [it was _a] ,_ [a] [flag] [that] said [freedom of speech] , 
A|63| A: [And I] [would] _never_ [do] [it . I] [I] love this country [too] [much] [, and] [that] symbol means [a lot] [to] _me ._ 
B|64| M: _Right ._ 
A|65| A: Um . But [I guess] [it's just] _one_ [of] those things where [if] [they] [if] [that's] what's something [it's] [a] need [for] _them_ [you [know] .] 
B|66| M: [Yeah .] 
A|67| A: [Yeah .] Yes . _No ._ 
B|68| M: [And] _, uh_ _, I don't [know_ [,] I] [, [I] think that's] [one] [thing] [that's] important . 
A|69| A: [Right .] [Yeah [.] Uh] huh . 
B|70| M: [Uh [,] [and] _I] don't think [that_ [the] government] [should] _, uh_ _, uh_ , excuse [me] , excuse [me .] The _, the_ _, the_ power structure [of the] United States [is] not [as] _, [uh_ uh] , [as] powerful [as] [it] [should be] . 
A|71| A: [Uh] huh . 
B|72| M: [and [I] don't] [want] [them] [to] [have to] live [here] . 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] 
B|74| M: [And] _, uh_ , [I'm] not sure [what the] colors were _, but_ _, uh_ . 
A|75| A: [I agree] [there] _too [._ [I] agree with] [you] [there] _too [._ I] [I] [the] um [I] [I] [it's] [I] find [it] [you know] personally disgusting But [I don't think [that] [I] don't think that] [uh] [we] [have a] [right to] stop somebody from [that] [you know] 
B|76| M: [No .] 
A|77| A: [the same] [I don't [know] [I] guess] [I] get [I] get [uh] all mixed [up] inside . when , [Yeah] 
B|78| M: [Yeah [.] I] [do] , [too .] 
A|79| A: [it] when [it's] [uh] [it's] [an] emotional issue [, and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] _about it_ logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] [say] [to] yourself now emotionally this [is] [a] disgusting [thing] [, uh] [but] logically um even [you know] [for] instance [, the] pro life pro choice movement [, uh you know [I] don't know] anybody [that] actually supports abortion [, but] [they] [would] [vote] pro choice . 
B|80| M: [Uh [,] [that's] true] . 
A|81| A: because [you know] That's [just] [a] disgusting [thing] [you know] somebody [an] abortion means [it's] somebody's [in] trouble [and] [that] [it's] [an] awful [thing] [, you know] 
B|82| M: [Yeah .] 
A|83| A: [but] [Yeah .] [but] [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] [what] [I mean ,] see [, but] [but] realistically when [you think of] [it] [it] [just] sounds like such [an] awful [thing] [, and] [it] evokes [an] emotional response [. [I] think [that's] the] hardest [thing] [, I don't know] [if] [I] could ever [be] [a] judge , because _some_ things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|84| M: Uh-hugs . 
A|85| A: [No ,] no [I think] [the] um sometimes [I guess] [what] did [I] read recently [the] um [the] [uh] Christian [uh] _point_ [is] [is] _always_ [the] _point_ [of] [well] [it's] at conception [but] then um [a] friend [of] mine's [a] doctor [and] argues [with] others [that] conception [is] [a] biblical term . [And] [there's] no concept [of] conception [in] medicine or biology . 
B|86| M: [Uh ,] I've heard [of] [that .] 
A|87| A: [so] then [that] [so] [that] throws out [that] idea makes [it] [a] religious discussion then . So [it's] [I don't know .] It's very [it's] [it's] [uh you know] It's [a] [it's] [a] topsy-turvy world [and] [it's] [really] something how um political ideas [and] viewpoints within [one] country can vary [so] [much] [and] also within um within [a ,] 
B|88| M: [Uh [,] well [,] that's] [a] good [point . [I] guess] I've [never] [really] [thought] [about it] [that] [way] . I've [just] [always] [thought] [that] maybe [there] [are] [some] boundaries [that] we're not supposed [to be] drawn [on] [. [I] mean] [that] maybe [we] [should [be] able to] separate [them] . 
A|89| A: [Yeah] [and] how [Yeah] how it'll sway from [one] [one] extreme [to] another . 
B|90| M: [Right] , exactly . 
A|91| A: [Uh] [I think that] [uh you know I] [I] [just] read something [I think] [in] TIME magazine [uh] [about] um protest
