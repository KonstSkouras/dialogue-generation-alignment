A|1| A: _Uh _,_ I_ play the piano 
B|2| M: _Oh ,_ _great ._ 
A|3| A: _and _,_ uh_ _, _I have_ a_ four year old _who _,_ who_ has started _to_ play the piano . He does _that _,_ uh_ , musically , listens _and_ then he _can_ play , which is _kind of_ interesting . 
B|4| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _I_ _think_ it's because he's always heard _music_ [in] our _home_ _all_ the , since he _was_ [a] baby . 
B|6| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|7| A: _Uh ,_ _my_ husband _and_ _my_ other _son_ _, who's_ eleven just _got_ _through_ singing [in] [a] _musical_ here , [in] , [in] the community [at] Music Man . 
B|8| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|9| A: [Yeah] , _and_ _that's_ lots _of_ _fun ._ 
B|10| M: _That's_ , [that's] neat . 
A|11| A: _Uh ,_ basically _they_ read [in] the newspaper _that_ there were open auditions . It _was_ the Plano Repertory Theatre . 
B|12| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|13| A: _And_ _so_ _they_ went _and_ tried out _and_ _my_ husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man _and_ _my_ _son_ played one _of_ the children [in] [a] band . 
B|14| M: _Oh ,_ [that's] neat . 
A|15| A: So _, yeah_ , _it_ _was_ really _fun_ , _and _,_ uh_ , _my_ _son_ plays the clarinet [in] his band [at] [school] , _and_ _my_ daughter takes piano lessons , too . 
B|16| M: [I] _see_ . 
A|17| A: But _, uh_ , we just really _like_ _music ._ It's [a] _, I , I_ especially _like_ _it as_ an outlet when the T V goes off , we get the T V off _and_ just _have_ _some_ nice quiet _music ._ 
B|18| M: [Yeah] . 
A|19| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|20| M: Okay . 
A|21| A: _Uh _,_ I have_ him take from [a] friend _of_ mine _who_ teaches Suzuki . Which is an auditory type _learning_ experience . 
B|22| M: _Oh [,_ yeah] . 
A|23| A: _You_ listen _to_ the _music_ _and_ then learn _to_ play _it_ by by hearing the intervals _and_ things _like_ _that_ . 
B|24| M: _Oh ,_ [that's] _, _that_ , that_ sounds [like] [fun .] 
A|25| A: [I] teach _, uh_ , [like] _what_ is traditionally taught _, you_ _know _,_ you_ look [at] the note on the page _and_ _you_ play what's on the piano , but he can't learn [like] [that] . He's [a] delayed child . He's only _about_ _, I guess_ he's _about_ _two_ _and_ [a] half [in] his real understanding _of_ things . 
B|26| M: _Um ._ 
A|27| A: _And , uh_ _, so_ when _my_ friend played something on the piano _and_ he played _it_ _, uh_ , with his _right_ hand , we went , wow 
B|28| M:  !!! % !! Remind _me ._ 
A|29| A: we better _have_ him _do_ _do_ something _. You know ,_ educationally . 
B|30| M: [Yeah] . 
A|31| A: So [that] _was_ really [fun .] 
B|32| M: _Well [,_ I guess] [that's] [about] [all] [I] need [to] say , [about] [music .] 
A|33| A: My husband _and I_ love _to go_ [to] the musicals downtown , though . 
B|34| M: _Oh [,_ yeah] . 
A|35| A: So , _my_ husband _and I_ love _to go_ [to] the musicals when _they_ come into town into Dallas . 
B|36| M: _Oh [,_ yeah] . 
A|37| A: [Um .] 
B|38| M: [and] she's , she's [learning] [all] kinds [of] stuff [and ,] um [, so] I'm hoping [that ,] um [that] she's able [to] [kind of] stay [home] [and] not [have] [to] worry [about] [what] she's doing . 
A|39| A: [Oh [,] I] _think_ [that's] [great .] 
B|40| M: [I _, I] don't _know_ ._ 
A|41| A: [That's] really hard [I] _think ,_ because , especially if _you_ start them [and] then _they_ get pretty _good_ [and] then _they_ get close , _ten _,_ you_ _know ,_ eleven _or_ something , _they_ _go [,_ I don't] _want_ _to do_ _this_ _anymore_ [and] _you're_ [like] God [, I] really _want_ _you_ _to _do_ it_ . 
B|42| M: [Yeah] . 
A|43| A: _You [know_ .] 
B|44| M: [I] mean [, I] [was] , I'm thinking , [you're] [right] _, _that_ I_ need [to go] back [to] work [and I] need [some] [kind of] support [. You know [,] I] [know] [that] [my] husband's _been_ fighting [, you] [, you] [think [,] I] need [, I , I] [can] [go] back [in] [two] years [and] say , okay [, I] [got] [to [go] [,] you] [have] [to go] [through] [this] . [And] [I] said , well [, I have] no [, I] won't [go] back [, you] _don't have_ [to do] [that] [anymore] [, you] [can] [go] [and] [do [it] as] long [as] [you] [want] . [And , uh] . 
A|45| A: So sometimes it's hard [to] , [to] [know] exactly when , but [, I don't [know] ,] if she acts [like] she wants [to] _or_ says she wants [to] maybe [you] could [have] her take [some] for [a] while [and] [see] how she likes [it] . 
B|46| M: [That's] true . [That's] true , [that's] true 
A|47| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|48| M:  !!! % !! RemindMe !! ets !! Grammar !! = !! et !! ; !!!!! [You] !! This !! [I] !! That !! That !! Have !! A !! ctic !!

A|51| A: [Well ,] [it] [can] get expensive 
B|52| M: [Yeah] . 
A|53| A: [that's] for sure . 
B|54| M: [Well] [what] [kind of] car are [you] thinking [about] buying ? 
A|55| A: [I ,] [my] friend is , is very generous [in] , [in] letting us [have] [my] children [, uh] _, do_ the Suzuki method without paying [a] lot out . 
B|56| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|57| A: [Yeah] [, so] it's [been] _good_ for our family .
