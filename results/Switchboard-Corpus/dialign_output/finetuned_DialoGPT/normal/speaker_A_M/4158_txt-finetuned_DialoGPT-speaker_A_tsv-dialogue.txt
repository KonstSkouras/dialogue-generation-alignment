B|0| M: _Yeah ,_ _it's_ _, uh_ 
A|1| A: _Uh ,_ 
B|2| M: Well _, I_ _, _I_ work_ _in_ _the_ legal department _and I_ _, uh_ _I work_ _on _,_ uh ,_ speech _, uh_ speech , recognition systems . 
A|3| A: Uh-huh . Me too . _I work at_ [, uh ,] [the] Georgia Tech Research Institute . 
B|4| M: _Oh , yeah_ _, yeah_ . 
A|5| A: Um _, I'm_ _a_ co-op student so [I work] [and] _go_ _to_ school about halftime . _And [, uh_ [,] I] _really_ _don't_ have any job benefits _to_ speak of . We're kind of _, um_ [, I] _don't_ know , _they_ just kind of forget us [on] _that_ end . We _don't_ _really_ have any vacation or _, you_ know , sick days or health care or anything _really_ so . 
B|6| M: _Yeah ._ Well _, that's_ _, _that_ , that_ sounds _like_ [you] guys are _pretty_ _well_ employed _then_ . 
A|7| A: Exactly . Exactly . 
B|8| M: [I'm] [, I] _, I guess_ [I'm] _pretty_ lucky _because_ [I work] _for_ [a] university . 
A|9| A: What about [you] ? 
B|10| M: Well [, [I] work at] [a] university . 
A|11| A: Huh . 
B|12| M: [And , uh] [they] [, um] . 
A|13| A: [Yeah .] _Uh ,_ [they] _do that_ _I think_ if _you're [,_ uh ,] research here [then] [I] know of some of [the] _people_ [that] have gotten _their_ masters [and _I] think_ [that [,] um] , [they] might _, you_ know , pay [for] _that ._ Pay [for] [the] classes [and] stuff 
B|14| M: _Yeah _,_ that's_ true . 
A|15| A: _but_ [I] know [they] let _you ,_ they'll let [you] decrease how many hours _you work_ by kind of percentage . _You_ know , they'll let _you work_ halftime if _you want to_ , if _you want to_ finish , 
B|16| M: [Uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|17| A: _you want to_ , [Yeah .] They'll let _you work_ , decrease your number of hours by any percentage just , just about so if _you want to_ get your masters [and] [then] [, _I] think_ of course [you] get [like] [a] , with your extra degrees [you] get [a] pay raise due so [that] will probably help _out_ . 
B|18| M: Right . 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: _But_ [, uh] . 
A|21| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah [,] _I] think_ [, _I] mean_ [that's] [pretty] [, that's] [a] [pretty] important [, uh ,] part of _it_ there [because] [that , that] can _be really_ expensive if [you] ever have any health problems . My dad [, _I] think_ my _, I'm_ still covered [on ,] with my dad's [, uh ,] health plan [at] his , where he works _, but_ _it_ would definitely _be_ _something_ _to_ look into once [I] get my own . 
B|22| M: Well _, I guess_ [I] [, uh] . 
A|23| A: Uh-huh . 
B|24| M: [I think] _it's_ going [to] [be really] hard [for] everybody [to] find [a] good program [, uh] . 
A|25| A: [the] [I think] [the] [, I guess] _the only_ real [, um] , _benefit_ [I guess] [you] could say working , [for] me working here , besides _I mean_ [I'm] learning [and] stuff [because] _, I'm_ [at] _, you_ know , [in] school . 
B|26| M: [Yeah .] 
A|27| A: [But] there's , there's some where [, uh [,] uh ,] student employees working [for] [the] government _don't_ have [to] pay Social Security tax . [that's] about , five percent right there 
B|28| M:  !!!!,!!!.!! etwork !! % !! eting !!?!! [I] !! [You] !! iful !! So , [you're [,] [you] [,] [you] work] [for] Texas Instruments ?! [You] [do] !! _That's_ great !! _Oh_ !! 
A|29| A: so . 
B|30| M: Well [, that's] good . 
A|31| A: [That's] about _the only_ real bonus 
B|32| M: [Yeah .] 
A|33| A: [I] have , so [I] have [to] take [that] into consideration when [I] evaluate [like] how much [I] get paid [you] know , [because] if [I] was working somewhere else I'd have [to] [, you] know , pay an extra five percent , or so . 
B|34| M: Right . Right . 
A|35| A: Huh . [Yeah .] 
B|36| M: [But] [I guess] [that's] [the only] thing [I] see changing , _is_ [that [,] uh ,] [people] are more willing [to] sacrifice [their] time [and] energy [to] [benefit] society rather than [, uh] 
A|37| A: [Oh , yeah] ? 
B|38| M: [And [,] um] . 
A|39| A: Uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|40| M: [I mean] [, I'm] sure [that [,] [you] [,] you] [don't] [want to] [go] [out] [and] , [and] buy [something] [, but] [you want to] [do] [it] [, you] need [to] [do [that] .] 
A|41| A: help [a] lot . [Yeah .] See around , around here [it's] [like] [, uh ,] we [pretty] much [work] from project [to] project [on ,] [well] [, you] know , with different sponsors . 
B|42| M: [Yeah .] 
A|43| A: There's not , there [is] not [a] whole lot of [, you] know , funded research from ,
