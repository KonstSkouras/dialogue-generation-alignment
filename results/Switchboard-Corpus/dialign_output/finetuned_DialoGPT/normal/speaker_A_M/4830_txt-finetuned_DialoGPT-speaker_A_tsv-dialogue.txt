A|25| A: _Well , I_ _know _._ That's_ [what] I'm _saying_ . _But I think_ [a lot] [of] , all [of the] whole [criminal] _system_ _is_ messed _up_ _in_ , _in_ [that] regard .

A|33| A: _And , uh_ _I , I think_ [they] should . 
B|34| M: [I] [do] [too] .

B|36| M: [Right] [, and] [it's] not fair . 
A|37| A: [they] , _they're_ caught dead [to] rights . [I , I] [just] [think that] [that's] , they've , they've [taken] [a] life [and] [if] [, they] should pay _for_ [it] with their life . 
B|38| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] 
B|40| M: [I think] [that's] [the] best _way_ [to] [go] [because] then [you] [can] [, you] [can get] [a] , [a] judge [to] actually decide .

B|48| M: [Well , [I , I] think] there [is] , there [is] some [things] [that] need [to] be changed [. Uh] _like [,_ uh] . 
A|49| A: Oh , yeah . [I [, I] _, I] don't_ agree with [that] _at_ all . 
B|50| M: [Uh [,] you [know] .] 
A|51| A: Imagine [the] guilt [that] person would [have] . [I mean] burned [out] .

A|53| A: There's there's no possible [way] [that] [you] [could] [, uh [,] you know ,] feel good [about] yourself . 
B|54| M: [Yeah [.] That's] right . 
A|55| A: [If] [you] had [to do something] [like] [that] , day after day .

B|60| M: [Yeah] , [that's] true . 
A|61| A: [I mean ,] supposing [I] come [up] [to] [you] [and] [I] [just] point blank kill [you] .
