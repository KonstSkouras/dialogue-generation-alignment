B|0| M: Well _, I_ _, I_ work _in_ _a _,_ a_ machine shop . 
A|1| A: Sure . 
B|2| M: _But , uh_ . 
A|3| A: You bet . 
B|4| M: I'm _a_ graduate _of the_ school _and_ _so I_ _know_ _a lot_ _about_ _that_ kind _of_ thing . 
A|5| A: Look professional 
B|6| M: Uh-huh . 
A|7| A: _Yeah [,_ I] understand . [I] am [a [,] I] _own_ my company . [I] am [in] _the [,_ I] am [, uh] , manufactures rep sales organization [and] my office _is_ [a] small office [and] [I] am very casual [and] wear slacks [and] sports shirt [and] things _like that_ 
B|8| M: Uh-huh . 
A|9| A: _but_ then when [I] travel it _is_ [a] _little_ different situation . 
B|10| M: _Right ._ 
A|11| A: _Yeah _,_ I think_ [in] today's society [, uh] , there _is_ more credibility _to be_ quite honest 
B|12| M: _Uh ,_ yeah . 
A|13| A: [I] will always remember [, I] will tell this _real_ quick story when [I] graduated from college , my first job years ago [, uh] , thirty years ago , twenty-nine years ago , [in] fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
B|14| M:  !!! % !! Remind _me_ . 
A|15| A: [I] worked for _the , uh_ , Smith Douglas Division [of] Borden Chemical [and] [I] sold [uh] _, you know ,_ manure . 
B|16| M: Oh , really ? 
A|17| A: _And_ [, uh] [, I] would _go out and_ call on farmers [and] [I] would always try _to_ look my best wearing sport coats [and] things _like _that_ ,_ _but_ [I] was calling on guys [that] wore bib overalls . 
B|18| M: Oh , really . 
A|19| A: _And_ [so] , one day [I] got up [and] thought _well_ [I] will just _go_ casual [and] _you know_ [that] [I] called on [a] guy wearing exactly _that ,_ bib overalls , [and] he sort [of] told [me] [that] he expected [me] _to be_ professional 
B|20| M: _Uh_ . 
A|21| A: [and] he sort [of] expected [me] _to_ dress as [a] professional 
B|22| M: _Right ._ 
A|23| A: [so] [, uh] , it was sort [of] , 
B|24| M: Oh . 
A|25| A: You bet even back then 
B|26| M: [Yeah ,] they had [to be] [in] their [own] [little] world . 
A|27| A: [so I] sort [, uh] , been aware [of] my dress ever since then [and] try [to] look my best , 
B|28| M: Uh-huh . 
A|29| A: _but_ here again [I] dress casual quite [a] bit [so] , 
B|30| M: [Yeah] . 
A|31| A: It gives _you_ confidence . In my business if [I] call on [the] [the] J C Penney company here [in] Dallas or say someone say Sears [and] Roebuck [in] Chicago , then [I] wear coat [and] tie . If [I] call on just [, uh] [, a] normal [little] dealer [of] mine [, I] might [be] casual . 
B|32| M: _Uh [,_ I] _have_ [, uh] [I] _have_ [a] problem , uh-hilted skirt . 
A|33| A: [I] call on Oshman's sporting goods , again , it may [be] casual or it may [be] coat [and] tie . So it depends . 
B|34| M: Oh [, I] [know] . 
A|35| A: [Uh ,] probably no . 
B|36| M: Oh , okay . 
A|37| A: _but_ then it depends on who _you_ are calling on . Who you're _, you_ _like_ your minister standing up [in] front [of] _you_ _with_ no tie _, you_ just [, uh] , he would [be] missing _something_ . 
B|38| M: _Right ._ 
A|39| A: Although , he shouldn't [be] evaluated on _that ._ 
B|40| M: [Yeah] . 
A|41| A: So , _it's_ its' just different . 
B|42| M: [Yeah] . 
A|43| A: Yes , it _is_ . [I] am [, uh] , _like_ [a] Catholic [and] [the] people [that] _go_ [to] my Church _, you know_ Catholics dress very casual [a lot] [of the] times . People [in] jeans [and] [in] whatever , _but_ yet [the] way [I] was raised [, I] am [a] converted Catholic _, the_ way [I] was raised [, I] was raised [a] Baptist [and] _like_ as [a] youngster [I] use [to] always dress up all [the] time . [I] guess [that] has changed also . 
B|44| M: Oh , yeah , yeah . 
A|45| A: [Right .] 
B|46| M: [but] [, uh] . 
A|47| A: Sure . 
B|48| M: [And] [I] [, I think] [that] [the [,] [the] , uh] [you know [,] the] [real] problem [with] [the ,] [with] [the] whole system [is] , [is] [, uh] . 
A|49| A: [But] . That [is] [a] very good point . [I] am from West Virginia [so I] understand what [you] are saying there 
B|50| M: Uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [and] _it's_ _it's_ [a] very good point . 
B|52| M: [And] [it's] hard [to] believe [that [,] you know ,] [that] [the] average _person_ can't afford [, you] can't imagine [, you] [, _you] have to_ pay [that] much money [to] , [to] [go out and] do [something] [like [that] .] 
A|53| A: [But] [you] shouldn't , what's [the] old saying [, you] shouldn't judge [a] book by its cover . 
B|54| M: [Uh ,] [well] , that's true . 
A|55| A: [And] [, uh] , evaluation [of] an individual . Course , all [of] it depends on [the] type [of] job responsibility [you have] . [I think] [you have to] dress sort [of] accordingly . 
B|56| M: [Right .] 
A|57| A: [But , uh] [, you] certainly should not judge [a] book by its cover [and] [, uh] , or evaluate [a] [person] by [that .] 
B|58| M: [Right .] 
A|59| A: What [about] season [to] season . Does [, I] guess your dress changes . 
B|60| M: Well [, uh] .
