A|14| A: _Oh , yeah [._ I] [had] _a [, uh_ ,] last _year_ [I] [had] [I] [had] another German Shepherd , _now_ [this] [one] _was_ purebred [and , uh _,] he_ , when _he was_ _about_ seven months [old] _got_ [a] gastrointestinal virus [and] _was_ _just about_ _on_ death's door [but [,] uh ,] managed _to get_ him [to] [a] veterinarian [in] [time ,] 
B|15| M: _Oh ._ 
A|16| A: [and , uh _,] and_ _on_ huge doses [of] antibiotics _, and_ _he_ actually _got_ over [it] _with_ , seven hundred dollars [in] vet bills , 
B|17| M: [Oh] _my_ goodness . 
A|18| A: _um [,_ but] _he_ [had] actually _was_ able _to get_ him over [that] . 
B|19| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|20| A: _And_ then _he was_ gaining weight again , _was_ [just] getting healthy _, [and_ , uh _,] he_ [put] _on_ _about_ fifteen [to] twenty pounds after [the] thing [and] then _he_ _got_ hit by [a] Cadillac . 
B|21| M: [Oh _,] my_ . 
A|22| A: So [, I] _couldn't_ believe _it ._ That _was_ [, _that] was_ [really] _hard_ . 
B|23| M: _Well_ , that's [, [that] [,] that] _is_ [, that] [would] _be_ tough . 
A|24| A: _And_ _that was_ even harder for _, I was_ _on_ [a] business trip _at_ [the] [time] _and [the_ dog] _was_ _being_ house sit , _or_ [dog] sit , _whatever_ , by [some] friends [of] mine [down] [the] street , 
B|25| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: _so_ _they just_ felt _absolutely_ awful . 
B|27| M: [I] bet . 
A|28| A: _And I_ felt , felt probably worse for [them] than , than for [me] _because_ , oh gosh [they [,] the [, uh] ,] [this] fellow's wife who _was_ [, uh ,] watching [the dog] _, she [,_ I think] _she_ loved [that] [dog] more than [I] did [and _, uh] ._ _She_ _was_ [really] attached [to] [it ,] 
B|29| M: _Oh ._ 
A|30| A: [but [,] uh [,] it's] unfortunate [, but] _now_ [, I've] _got_ another [one] , _so_ .

B|35| M: [Oh _,] well [,_ _I] guess_ _they just [,_ uh] 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] 
B|37| M: [I] _just [,_ I was] [absolutely] , 
A|38| A: _Right ._ 
B|39| M: _so I_ [just] _went_ ahead _and got_ [one] . 
A|40| A: My dad's _like_ [that [,] he] [, uh [,] he] [had] [a] beagle [that] [he] loved [and , uh ,] when [that] beagle passed away [, uh [,] he] didn't want [, he] wasn't going [to] [have] another [dog] , there's _no_ way , 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] _That's_ _right_ . 
A|42| A: _no_ [how] _, and_ then [, uh [,] the [,] he] [the] beagle died [in] [I guess] _about_ October [and] by Christmas [time] [we] [went] [down] [to] [the] pound [and got] him [, uh [,] I] _or_ [, I] Humane Society [and got] [, uh _,] got_ another [one] [, a] stray . 
B|43| M: [Oh , really] ? 
A|44| A: _And_ _she , she_ turned _out_ _to be a_ great [dog] [and] [we] [had] _her_ for six years until _she_ [just] passed away recently [and] again dad [went] through [the] whole thing [, but ,] mom [went] an ,

A|70| A: This , [this] friend [of] mine has [, well] [it's] [the] same guy _that was_ watching [, uh [,] my] German Shepherd when [he] [got] hit [, but [,] uh ,] [went] fishing _with_ him _on_ Friday [and] took , he's [got] [a] full [, a] pure bred Golden Retriever [and] then [I] [had , uh [,] the] puppy [, _a] little_ tiny puppy [and] [we] [went] [and] took [the] two [dogs] up fishing . [And] [this] [, [they] just [,] they] [had] [a] ball romping [around] , 
B|71| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [and [,] you know [,] you can't] _get_ [a] Golden Retriever near _water_ without [it] jumping [in] . 
B|73| M: [Right .] [That's] true . 
A|74| A: [And [, uh] ,] [this] Golden Retriever jumped [in] [the , the [,] really] fast moving [, uh ,] river current [, [and] [, uh] .] 
B|75| M: [Oh [, yeah] [,] I think] that's [what] [they] call [it .] 
A|76| A: [Well] [no] , actually [he] [had] [no] trouble _at_ all . He first jumped [in] [and [I] ,] he's , he's [just about] [a year] [old] himself [and] never [had] [really] [, I] [don't] [think] _he'd_ swum before . 
B|77| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [But] [he] jumped [in] , [in] [the , the] river . 
B|79| M: [Yeah .] 
A|80| A: [Well] [the] puppy jumped [in] [the ,] into [some] [of the] pools [but] [not] into [the [,] I was] careful [to] keep _her_ away from [the , the] fast moving _water_ , 
B|81| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: 'cause if _she_ fell [in] then I'd [of] _been_ , [had] [to go] [in] after _her_ . [And] up here [the] water's probably [about] forty degrees [right] _now ._ 
B|83| M: [Oh .] 
A|84| A: _And I_ [would] [not] [have] _been_ fun _trying to_ retrieve _her_ [, but [,] uh ,] [this dog] , Dennis jumped [in] [and got] [this] look _on_ his face _like_ [what] [do] [I] [do] _now_ , as he's floating [down] [the] river then finally discovered [that] [he] could swim [and , uh ,] actually paddled up against [the] current [and , uh ,] made [it] back [to] [the] shore [and] climbed up [and] then [, he] [, he] jumped [in] again [, and] _he was_ swimming for quite [a] _bit ,_ all afternoon . He loved [it .] 
B|85| M: [Oh .] 
A|86| A: Cocoa didn't [think] too much [of] [it ,] though . _She_ jumped [in] [and] then started screaming [and] made [me] pull _her_ back _out_ [. I] pulled _her out_ [and , uh ,] then [had] [to] wrap _her_ up [in] [a] sweatshirt _because_ _she_ [was] shivering [so] bad , 
B|87| M: [Oh ,] goodness . 
A|88| A: [and] [so] [, but [,] uh _,] she_ [got] over [it ,] [so] .

A|94| A: [Yeah] [, I've] [, I] live [right] across [the] street from [a , a] big lake here [, um [,] it's] _on_ Oneida lake [and] [I'm] wondering if [, uh ,] if she'll want [to go] _out_ there [and] [go] swimming next [year] [. I mean , I've] [got] [, the] yard's all fenced [in] [so] [she] doesn't [run] loose [, but [,] uh [,] she] could [go] [in] sometime when , if [I'm] watching _her_ , 
B|95| M: [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: [so] . 
B|97| M: [Yeah .] 
A|98| A: [Oh] _really ._ 
B|99| M: [She] , [she's] [just] [been] _a real_ trooper [, and] [I've] [been] [trying [to] get] [her out] [of] [that] situation , [because] [it's] [just] [so] [hard] _to get out_ [of the] [water] . 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] 
B|101| M: [She] [just] kept fighting [, [and] I] [just] [couldn't] deal [with] [it .] 
A|102| A: No [, no .] 
B|103| M: [I] _haven't_ [seen] [that] [one] yet . 
A|104| A: [Oh] _really ._ 
B|105| M: [Yeah .] We _, we_ [got] [it] [at] [a , uh] [a] _movie_ place [in] Chicago . 
A|106| A: [Oh ,] okay [, my] [my] [dog] , last German Shepherd [, _it] _was_ [a_ real] chore [trying to] give him [a] bath too . [And] _that was_ [the] thing [I] [couldn't] figure [out] [because] [he] [would] [go] [in] [the] lake [, it] wasn't _like he_ didn't 
B|107| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: normally [, [I] mean] [he] didn't seem [to] [have] [a] problem [with] getting wet [, but] if [you] wanted [to get] him wet , forget [it .] 
B|109| M: [Right .] 
A|110| A: [Yeah .] 
B|111| M: [and] [he'd] [just] [kind of] jump [on] [it] [like [he] was] _having a_ fight [or] [whatever] .
