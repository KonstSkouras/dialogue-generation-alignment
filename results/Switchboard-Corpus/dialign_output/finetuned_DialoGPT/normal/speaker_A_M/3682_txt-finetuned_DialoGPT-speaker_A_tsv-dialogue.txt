A|40| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh_ [, yeah .] 
B|41| M: _and _,_ uh ,_ we [don't] _really_ [have] _, uh_ _really_ [a] structured budget .

A|42| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|43| M: but _it's_ _not_ [a] big _, uh ,_ big deal . 
A|44| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|45| M: [So] [I'm] always going [to] _my_ house . 
A|46| A: [Yeah .] 
B|47| M: [So] , [I'm] _not_ _really_ going _to have_ much choice [, I] guess . 
A|48| A: _Yeah [,_ that's good .] [Well ,] one [of] [my] favorites [if] [I don't] want [to have] other [people] bring stuff [, I just] want [to] treat [them] [is] [to make] chicken [and] rice . 
B|49| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh , uh-uh 
A|50| A: [It's] [very] easy [to] . 
B|51| M: [Oh _,] I'll_ _have to_ try [that .] 
A|52| A: You [don't] [like] [it] ? 
B|53| M: No , huh-uh . 
A|54| A: [Oh [,] you] [do _,] okay [,_ yeah [.] [I] have a] [really] easy recipe [for] [that ,] where _you just_ brown [the] chicken _and then you put_ rice [in the] bottom [of] [the] pan [, you] pour bouillon [or] chicken broth _over it_ 
B|55| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [and _, _and] you_ put_ [the] chicken [in] , [then] pour [the , uh ,] broth [over] _and _you_ can put_ mushrooms [in] [if you] want [, [and _then] you] just_ . 
B|57| M:  !!! % Okay [, okay] . 
A|58| A: _Yeah ,_ [over] uncooked rice 
B|59| M: Okay . 
A|60| A: _and _you_ can either_ _microwave_ [it] [or] [do] [it in the] oven [, and] [it] [just] . 
B|61| M: Okay . 
A|62| A: _It_ fluffs _up_ [, and] [it's] [really] moist . 
B|63| M: _I'll_ bet . 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh] , wow [, yeah .] 
B|65| M: [And] [then you just] cover [it] _with_ [a [,] uh ,] newspaper [, and you] cover [it] [and then you put] [it in] [a] [microwave] [for] _about_ five minutes [, and then] [, uh] [put] [it] _on_ [the next] plate [and [,] uh] [and] cover [it [.] And] [you can put] [, uh] carrots [and] green peppers [and , and] green olives _on_ _there_ _too_ . 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: [So] [I] [, I] [, uh [,] I] try [to] [, I [like] [to] make] sure [I don't] [make] _too_ many mistakes 
A|68| A: [Well [,] I'll] [keep] [that] one [in] mind . 
B|69| M: _Yeah , [I_ don't] _know_ [if] _I've_ ever had [, uh _,] you _know_ ,_ [a] real [good] [, uh ,] real [good] ham [, or] [if] _I'd_ [just] had ham . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| M: _I've_ been trying [to make] [a ,] [a] fajita now [, and] [I'm] _not_ _, you _know_ [,_ [I] don't] _know_ [if] [it's] fajitas [or] _what_ , but _, you just_ [put] [it] _on_ [the] outside [and you] marinate [it] [and you put] [, uh ,] [put] tomato sauce [over it] [and] [I just] love [that .] 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] 
B|73| M: [and] [I] _was_ going [, okay ,] [I'm] going [to] take [that ,] [that [,] and then] [I] took _, um_ . 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah _,] you can_ [get] away [with] [it] even _having a_ semi _nice_ dinner , 
B|75| M: [Yeah _,] it's_ _not_ , _it ,_ [it] doesn't [really] , 
A|76| A: [or] [, you know] semi . 
B|77| M: Uh [, well] , [I'm] _not_ [really] into formal dining [out] [, I] [, I like] [just] [having a] [nice] meal . 
A|78| A: [Yeah .] 
B|79| M: _But _,_ um [,_ [I] don't] [know] [. I] guess [, I _just] [,_ I] guess [I'm] _not_ , [I'm] [just] _not_ [really] into [it .] 
A|80| A: [Yeah .] You [put] [in] [, um] 
B|81| M: [And] [, uh _,] it's_ [a good] thing [to have] , [because] [it] makes [the , uh] [the] meatballs come [out] [a] lot bigger . 
A|82| A: let's _see_ , [what] [was] [it ,] three quarters [of] cup [of] rice [or] , 
B|83| M: Uh [, [I] don't] _remember ._ [It] [was] something [like that .] 
A|84| A: [It] depends [on] _, you can_ [really] vary [it .] 
B|85| M: [Yeah .] 
A|86| A: [But] _you have to_ [put] [the] water [in] proportionally [. I] [can't] [remember [.] [I] think] [it was] three quarters cup rice [to] [two] cups water , [two] cups [, um ,] broth . 
B|87| M: [Yeah .] 
A|88| A: [Yeah ,] flavor . [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|89| M: [I] mean _, it's_ _not_ [like] [it's] [a] big [, uh ,] thick piece [of] something , 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [And] [, uh [,] that's] [the] type [of] thing [I [like] to] experiment [with] [. I] [, uh] [I] _, it's ,_ [it was] , [it ,] [it] seemed [to be] [a] [very] interesting thing [to] [do] [. [I] don't] _know ,_ [it] sounds [like] [you] might enjoy [it .] 
A|92| A: Um , let's _see [._ [I] think] [it was] [an hour] . [I've] [done] _it in the microwave_ [so] often lately [because] [, it's [,] it's] [really] easy . 
B|93| M: [Oh [,] I] [see .] 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] [But [,] [I think] it's] [about] [an hour] . 
B|95| M: [Oh [,] okay] . 
A|96| A: Or maybe [it's] only half [hour] . Um [, you [just] ,] until [the] rice looks fluffy [, and and] [not] overdone . You [know ,] before [it] gets overdone . 
B|97| M: [Oh [,] that's good .] 
A|98| A: [Yeah .] 
B|99| M: Okay . 
A|100| A: Um , [I'd] [let it cook] [just] [a] little bit [just] [so] [that] [the] cooking goes [a] little faster . 
B|101| M: Okay . 
A|102| A: [Yeah , I] liked your _idea_ [too] , [there] . 
B|103| M: [I] [, I like] [the] [idea .] 
A|104| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: [and then [you] can either] go ahead [and] [cook] [it in the microwave] [or] [you can] [just] leave [it in] [there] [and] [let it] rise [and then] [, uh ,] heat [it] [up] . 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| M: Uh [, you can] [, you] [don't] [have [to] be] [, [you] have to] , you've [just] [put] [it in] [there] [, you just] [have to] accept [it [.] [I] don't] [know] how long [it] takes [, I] guess . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: [And] [I] love [it] [when they] come home [and] they're [just] lonesome [and , and] [the] smell [is] [just ,] [just] absolutely wonderful .
