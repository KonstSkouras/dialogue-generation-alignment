B|0| M: Oh , well , that's _good_ . 
A|1| A: So , _we're_ just starting _into_ hunting _for_ child care . 
B|2| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|3| A: _Right_ now , both _of_ _us_ are students . 
B|4| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _Uh_ , _Uh_ , _University of_ Southern Mississippi . 
B|6| M: Oh _, okay_ . 
A|7| A: _Uh_ , she's , 
B|8| M: She's , she was _a , _a_ _,_ uh _,_ a_ sophomore _at_ U T _at_ _the_ [University of] Texas _at_ Dallas . 
A|9| A: [Yeah .] 
B|10| M: _And_ _, uh ,_ she , she _got_ , she was _from_ _a_ poor immigrant family _and_ _, uh_ 
A|11| A: _Uh_ , probably . _Uh_ , actually spring semester [a] year [from] now he's _going to _have to_ be_ _in_ child care [uh ,] five days [a] week more than likely . _Uh_ , depending _on_ how _my_ class schedule runs 
B|12| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|13| A: because _my_ wife will _be_ doing _her_ internship _that_ semester . 
B|14| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|15| A: It will _be_ forty hour week , not , no , eight _to_ five type [of] thing . 
B|16| M: Oh , that's great . 
A|17| A: So depending _on_ what _my_ class schedule looks _like ,_ he may spend four , anywhere [from] four _to_ eight hours [a] day _in_ child care [at] _that_ point . _Right_ now _we're_ trying _to_ avoid _it ,_ but we just , as [a] matter [of] fact just yesterday hired [a , a] girl _to [, uh_ ,] watch him . _Uh_ _, I_ _get_ out [of] class [at] certain time [and] _my_ wife _is_ already supposed _to be_ _on_ _her_ way _to_ _her_ class . _You know ,_ once [a] day this overlap happens where we _can't_ , _one of_ _us_ _be_ home . 
B|18| M: [Right] . 
A|19| A: So _for_ about twenty twenty , thirty minutes [a] day we [got] [a] baby-sitter comes _in_ . 
B|20| M: Oh , [my] goodness . 
A|21| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|22| M: _And_ [, uh] 
A|23| A: [Yeah .] 
B|24| M: [and] whether [it] was [going to] cost [us] money or whether [it] would [be] better [for] [us] [to have] , _you_ [know ,] our own , _you_ would [have to be] willing [to] sacrifice [to have] someone guide [us] . 
A|25| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: We could [have] had [her] there [to have] [her] dressed [, uh] . 
A|27| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: _And_ _they_ live [in] [a] town called David , which [is] _on the_ outskirts [of] London _. And_ they're , they're very happy . They [have] [, uh] [a] very elderly population . 
A|29| A: [Yeah .]

A|37| A: Yes . 
B|38| M: It's , _it's_ [, uh ,] [it] has _a lot of_ _things_ [to] offer [, uh] . 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] 
B|40| M: [and] , 
A|41| A: There's [a lot of] child care available , but invariably _there's_ waiting lists . 
B|42| M: _Yeah ,_ that's true . 
A|43| A: [And] we were [a] little slow getting [on the] waiting list with [the] [, uh [,] okay] _, the_ university [, uh ,] university's [, uh] [uh ,] department [of] [, uh [,] uh ,] their Home Ec Department 
B|44| M: [Uh] . 
A|45| A: [uh ,] [they] [, uh ,] [they] [have] [a] subbranch [, uh ,] American Family Counseling [and] their people staff this , this [, uh _,] the_ child care center just off campus . But [, uh ,] [they] [have] [a] pretty [good] size waiting list . 
B|46| M: Oh , _really_ ? 
A|47| A: So , 
B|48| M: [And] [I] think that's [one of] [the] _things_ that's _really_ important [to] [us] [is] [to , uh] [to] make sure [that] [, uh] ... 
A|49| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|50| M: [You know ,] [it ,] [it] seems _like , uh_ _you_ [know [,] the] longer _you_ wait [the] easier [it] [is] [to] [get] somebody , _you_ [know] . 
A|51| A: [Yeah .] 
B|52| M: [And] [I] think , you're right , [there's] [a lot of] _things_ [that] _you_ could _do_ , [like ,] _you_ , _you_ could go [and] , [and] [, uh] _you_ [know] walk [into] [a] room [and] , _you_ [can't] _do_ anything . 
A|53| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah ,] 
B|54| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|55| A: [a] cottage industry's [the] best way [to] [do] [it] [really] , because _if_ [you] over , 
B|56| M: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
A|57| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|58| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|59| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [And] [I] think [that] [we're] [really] [going to have [to] , uh] 
A|61| A: Yes [. And] [it's] amazing how much [good] [things] [like [, uh] ,] Sesame Street will [do] . 
B|62| M: [I] [know [,] I] [, I] don't [know] [if] [it's] [, uh] .
