A|2| A: _Right_ , okay . 
B|3| M: _And , uh_ . 
A|4| A: _Right ._ _So_ _you_ probably wouldn't recommend _that_ _as_ [a] big tourist spot ? 
B|5| M: Uh , _no_ _, because_ _, uh_ 
A|6| A: Ooh _, that_ _would_ _be_ _nice ._ 
B|7| M: _But_ _, uh_ . 
A|8| A: Did _you_ scuba dive _there_ ? 
B|9| M: _Oh ,_ yes , yes . 
A|10| A: Ooh _, that_ _would_ _be_ _nice ._ 
B|11| M:  !!! % _Yeah , that_ _is_ _, that's_ _what_ _we_ _like_ _to_ _do_ . We've _got_ _a ,_ we've _got_ _, uh _, we_ _have_ _a_ little_ _, uh_ _little_ , _little_ , well , _little_ school _on_ _one_ side _and a_ football field _and _,_ uh_ we've , we're _kind of_ _on a_ picnic _table_ _out_ _there _,_ so _we_ _,_ we_ _do_ _, uh_ 
A|12| A: [Oh [,] that] _would_ _be_ enjoyable . _Right_ _, yeah [,_ that's] , [a nice] break . 
B|13| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|14| A: [I haven't been on] vacation _in_ _a while_ either . Um , usually _when_ [we] _go_ [, we] _go to_ Colorado , [to] Estes Park area . Which [is] up [kind of] near Denver . _And , uh ,_ stay _in the_ mountains up [there ,] _do [a_ little] hiking [and] resting , get away from _the_ Texas heat [, that] [kind of] thing . 
B|15| M: _Uh-huh ._ Uh-homing . 
A|16| A: _So_ _it's_ _a lot_ [of] fun [. I] worked up [there] _last_ [summer] [, so] [I] guess _it_ _was_ [kind of] [like] [a] vacation _the_ , whole [summer] _long_ 
B|17| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|18| A: Worked at [a] camp [there _,] and_ [so] [I] _got to_ spend _a lot_ [of] time up _in the_ mountains . _So_ [that's] probably _my_ favorite place _when I_ _have _to_ go_ somewhere [on a] vacation . 
B|19| M: _Oh ._ 
A|20| A: [Oh .] 
B|21| M: _So [,_ that] [is] [a] new experience _for_ them . 
A|22| A: That's _nice ._ We , um [, we] canoed up _in_ Arkansas at _the_ Buffalo River . 
B|23| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|24| A: [And] [that's] _the_ best place [that] [I've] ever canoed . 
B|25| M: [Oh [,] that's] _really nice ._ 
A|26| A: It's [really] _, really_ pretty [. _I] was_ [a little] kid _then_ _, and_ [we] _to have_ [, uh , we] stayed at some park [and] they had [a little] [uh ,] mountain man who came down _the_ river every night _, and_ he _would_ give [a little] talk _about_ mountain things . _You_ _know , I_ think he wasn't [a real] mountain man _, but_ [we] were pretty convinced he _was_ [a] full , hermit who _lived_ up _in_ , _the_ woods [, that] he'd come _in_ his [little] log boat down _the_ river , 
B|27| M: Uh-hue . 
A|28| A: [and] [we] _would_ _have to_ , we'd [and] he'd make sassafras tea [out] [of] sassafras roots [that] he'd found [and ,] That's [a] good family place _to go_ , 
B|29| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|30| A: _and then_ _the_ river _was_ [really nice] [because] _it_ wasn't _too_ frightening _, but_ _it_ wasn't _, you know ,_ _too_ easy either . 
B|31| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|32| A: It _was_ [like] , 
B|33| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|34| A: That's true . 
B|35| M: [so] . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] _Right ._ 
B|37| M:  !!!!,!! et !! Remind _me_ . 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| M: [And , uh [,] so] [that] [, that] [, uh] ... 
A|40| A: Well [, that's] good . Well [, [we] ,] um , let's see , _the_ only other place [I've] ever vacationed , we'd _, you know ,_ _go_ [on] camping trips up [to] Texoma [and] things [like] [that] . 
B|41| M: Uh-uh . 
A|42| A: [And] _then_ [I] went [to] England [a] few years _ago_ . 
B|43| M: [Oh [,] really] ? 
A|44| A: _I was_ [a ,] student [there] [and] spent , um , [a] semester studying abroad _in_ London . 
B|45| M: [Yeah .] 
A|46| A: [And] [that] _was_ [a] great time [, because] _it's_ [so] [, that's] such [a] _neat_ place [and] _it's ,_ there's _not_ [a] language barrier [so] _you_ don't [, [I] mean ,] [there] there's [a little] bit [, because] there's some [of] those English words [that] _you_ just don't exactly _know_ [what] they [mean _,] [and_ _a] lot_ [of] people [have] trouble wrestling _with_ their accents _, but_ _it's , it_ _was_ [really] fun [. _I] , _I_ , I_ [really] enjoyed [that] _. I'm_ probably _going_ back [there] [to] work , _for _a_ year_ . 
B|47| M: [Yeah .] 
A|48| A: It _, it's_ [really nice [.] _I] would , I would_ spend _all_ _my_ time _in_ London , or most [of] _my_ time , 
B|49| M: Uh [, yeah] . 
A|50| A: [and] [that's] _it_ _was_ [really] different being _in_ [a] big city [, because] [I] don't get much into _urban_ _, you know [,_ really] _urban_ areas _a lot_ 
B|51| M:  !!!!,!! % !! Remind _me_ [of] [that] [, that] [, I] used [to] [do [a] lot] more [urban] exploring [when [I] was] younger [, and] [I] didn't [have to] drive [as] far [as] _I did_ now [, because] [my] car [was] [so] old , 
A|52| A: [and] _it_ [was] _, it's_ [really] _, it's_ sort [of] [a] weird [little] anonymous feeling where [no] [one] knows who _you_ are [and] _you_ can spend [a] whole day without _talking_ [to] anyone , which [I] thought _I would_ just hate _, but_ _it_ ended up being [kind of] [nice] [because] you're _not_ accountable [to] anyone . 
B|53| M: [Right .] 
A|54| A: _You_ could just [kind of] [kind of] walk around [and] observe , 
B|55| M: [Right .] 
A|56| A: [I did] [a lot] [of] just _going_ [out] by myself [and] riding [on] _the_ subway [and] watching people . 
B|57| M: [Oh ,] how [neat] . 
A|58| A: [And] [I] had [a] great time doing [that] . It [was] [really] interesting . 
B|59| M: [Oh .] 
A|60| A: [Yeah [,] I] _know ,_ 
B|61| M: [and] [I would , I would] _love to [go_ to] [the] East Coast [, you [know ,] I] _love to_ travel , 
A|62| A: [I] keep wanting [to] get up [to] [, I haven't] [, I haven't been] anywhere else outside _the United States [._ [I] haven't been] [to] Mexico or Canada or , 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [Oh .] 
B|65| M: [and [,] uh , we] [lived] [there] _for a while_ _, and then_ [we] moved [to] Dallas _about [a_ year] [and a] half [ago] 
A|66| A: [Yeah , that] [would] _be_ [nice [.] I] had [a] friend from [there] . 
B|67| M: [Oh [,] yeah [,] and] [I [, I] would] [like] [to [go] to] Spain . 
A|68| A: Then [I ,] I'd [love to go] somewhere _in_ Asia _, but_ I'd [have _to] [have_ a] tour guide _with_ [me] [to] help _with_ _all_ [the] language [and] _all_ [that] . 
B|69| M: [Oh ,] that'd [be] [neat] . 
A|70| A: [So [,] yeah [,] that's] why [, that's] why England [was] [nice .] Even [, we] traveled _in_ Europe [for] [about a] week [, and] [that] [was] even [nice] [because] [there] wasn't [, uh ,] [the] , most [the] places [we] went [, we] went [to] Germany [and] Switzerland [and ,] 
B|71| M: Uh , [I'm] [not] sure if [you] [have] any children [in [the] United States .] 
A|72| A: [Yeah [,] we have] . We . We [did] [, we] whirlwinded through , Europe . 
B|73| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: It [was] just insane twelve days where we'd just stop [like] [a] city [a] day [, and] [you] slept [on] [the] train at night . 
B|75| M: Uh-hue . 
A|76| A: [But] [there] wasn't [a _,] it_ [was] strange _, it_ [was] [kind of] sad , [there] wasn't ever [a] language _problem_ [there [,] because] everyone [in] Germany knew English [and] everyone [in] Switzerland , knew English . 
B|77| M: Uh-hau , uh-hue . 
A|78| A: [So] [we] were [kind of] pitiful . We found [one] restaurant [we] were [in] [and] [got] seated [, and then] [no] [one] knew English [in] [there [,] and] [we] were just finally had [to] break [out] [the] phrase book [and] start looking up things . 
B|79| M: [Yeah .] 
A|80| A: [But] _it_ [was] , 
B|81| M: Uh , 
A|82| A: [Oh [,] I] had fondue . That [was] easy [to] say 
B|83| M: [Oh .] 
A|84| A: Tried [to] get fondue [and] white wine [, and] [that] [was] , 
B|85| M: _Okay ._ Uh , first [of] [all] , [what] type [of] painting [do] [you] [do] ? 
A|86| A: [we] were able _to have_ [that] pretty , pretty effortlessly . There were some people at [the] next [table] who spoke English [, so we] elicited their aid [for a while] 
B|87| M: [Oh .] 
A|88| A: [and ,] they were very helpful 
B|89| M: Uh-hue . 
A|90| A: [so] , It [was] _, it_ [was] [a] pleasant time . 
B|91| M: [Yeah .] 
A|92| A: I'd , I'd [love to go] back [there] . There's just [not] time There's [not] enough time [to go] see everything [, and then] [to] afford [to] see everything . 
B|93| M: [Yeah .] 
A|94| A: [Right .] That's 
B|95| M: [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: That [and] sleeping late 
B|97| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|98| A: [I] keep hoping [for] . 
B|99| M: [Yeah [,] [it's] , it] [is] [a real] [problem] [. I'm] [not] sure how [long] [it's] [going] [to] [last] [, but] [, you know ,] we've [got] [, we have] [got [to] have] something . 
A|100| A: Well [it] [was] [nice] _talking with_ [you] . 
B|101| M: Nice [talking with] [, you] [too] . 
A|102| A: [And] [have a] good afternoon . 
B|103| M: [You] [too] .
