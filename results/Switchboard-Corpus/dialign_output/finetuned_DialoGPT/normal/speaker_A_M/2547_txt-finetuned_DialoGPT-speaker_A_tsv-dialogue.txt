B|48| M: _Uh _,_ I think_ [it _was] [,_ but] _I think_ _the [,_ the] people who _were_ opposed _to_ [it] said [that] [it was] [a] failed test [and] [that] _we_ needed _to_ [do] _something_ _about_ [it] . 
A|49| A: _Wow_ . 
B|50| M: _And [,_ uh] . 
A|51| A: Um . 
B|52| M: _It's_ [, uh _,] it [,_ it] seems _to_ me [that] _the ,_ [that] [the] immigration [of] America [has] [, uh [,] uh [,] uh] [been] [a] problem _for a_ long time _, and_ _that [,_ uh] ... 
A|53| A: Um [yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|54| M: But [, uh] . 
A|55| A: _Well ,_ _right_ now we're _just_ renting [, but] [it is] _a home_ . Um , 
B|56| M: A [home] , [a home] [that's not] [a] _, you know ,_ [a] condominium _or_ anything . 
A|57| A: [it's a] four bedroom [home] [It] [has] [about] [, I] guess , eighteen _hundred_ [square] feet [It's] [on one] floor

B|60| M: [Well [,] that's] nice . 
A|61| A: _Okay_ [I] _wasn't_ _sure_ . Most [of the] ones [, you know ,] _up_ north [and] everything [do] [, _but ,] um ,_ anyway _, it's [,_ uh [,] it's] pretty , also pretty typical [for] [the area] . Most [of] this [area] [was] developed , this _house_ [was] built [in] seventy-four . 
B|62| M:  !!! % [Oh [,] really] ? 
A|63| A: _So_ most _of the [,_ it's] _almost_ twenty years old [, and] most [of the] houses around _here_ [were] built pretty _much_ [the] same _style_ [Uh ,] [we] [have a] friend [that] lives _two_ blocks over [, and] his _house_ [is] _almost_ identical [to] us , except his [is] three bedrooms [and] _ours_ [is] four 
B|64| M: [Uh ,] uh-homing . 
A|65| A: [but] otherwise [the] layout [is] pretty _much_ [the] same . _So_ _I , I think_ most [of] them _are_ [there] _was [, it_ ,] like most areas [that] _are_ built _, um ,_ [there] [were] probably , like _two_ [or] three styles [you] could choose from 
B|66| M: [Uh] . 
A|67| A: [And [,] [and] , uh [,] that's] pretty _much_ all [the] houses [in] [the area] , [for] probably [a] [square] mile , I'd say , at least , maybe [even] [a] little bit _more_ than [that .]

A|75| A: [I have a] sister [that] used [to] [live] [in] Sevren . 
B|76| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|77| A: [And] _they_ bought their [home] [in] _I , I_ want [to] say like around nineteen seventy-five [or] [something] like [that [,] and] _they_ paid like , _they_ , _they_ [had] [it] built from [, you know ,] _they_ , _they_ designed [it] [and] everything [, and] [to] [have] [it] built _they_ [only] paid forty thousand [for] [it [,] and] when _they_ left [the area] _they_ sold [it] [for _a] hundred and_ twenty thousand 
B|78| M: [Oh ,] my word . 
A|79| A: [Yeah [,] so I] _just_ wondered [, you know ,] if _the whole_ [area] [was] like [that] [or] , 
B|80| M:  !!! % !! That's [the whole] thing . 
A|81| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|82| M: But [, uh [,] [I] don't know] . [I [,] uh] . 
A|83| A: Um . 
B|84| M: [So [,] [I] , I] [really] wanted [to] get [one] . [I [,] you] [, you] [would] [think ,] you'd [think] [that [,] you] wouldn't [have] [to] worry [about] getting [a] condominium [, but [,] you're] [right] [, it's] [just [,] it] [would be] nice . 
A|85| A: [Yeah .] 
B|86| M: But [it [was] , it] [had] [a very] modern feel [to] [it] . 
A|87| A: Sounds like [a] lot [of] money though 
B|88| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|89| A: _sure_ . [Yeah .] 
B|90| M: But [, uh [,] [I] don't know] . 
A|91| A: [Right] . [Oh , yeah .] 
B|92| M: [And [,] uh [,] you] [don't] [have] [to] pay any income tax . 
A|93| A: [Wow] . [Yeah .] 
B|94| M: [but [,] you're] [right] [, it [,] it] does seem [that ,] [that [,] you] see [more] [and] [more] [of the [,] uh , the] less fortunate people [are] becoming [more] selfish [and] less responsible . 
A|95| A: [Wow] [Wow] [, [that's] ,] 
B|96| M:  !!! Remind me [of] [that] [house] . 
A|97| A: Really ? [That] [much] [of] [a] difference ? 
B|98| M: [Uh [,] I [think] [,] [I] ,] I'm [not] [sure] [, I] [really] [don't know] . 
A|99| A: [Wow] . 
B|100| M: [yeah] [, it [,] it] [really] does [, it] makes [you think] . 
A|101| A: [Yeah] 
B|102| M: [but , um [,] it [,] it] [just [,] it was] [a] [, it] [had] [to] [be] put [up] . [I mean [,] it] did [not] [, you know [,] it] [really] didn't [, it] didn't [do] anybody any good [, [I] , I [think] , it] [wasn't] , 
A|103| A: [Wow] . [Why] [is] [that] ? [Do] [you know] ? [I mean] 
B|104| M: [Well [,] you're] [, you know [,] you] pay [a [hundred and] fifty] five dollars [for] state tax [in] [Texas] . 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh]

A|107| A: [Oh] . 
B|108| M: [and , uh [,] [so] [,] you know [,] it's [,] it] costs [you] [almost] twice as [much] as living costs .
