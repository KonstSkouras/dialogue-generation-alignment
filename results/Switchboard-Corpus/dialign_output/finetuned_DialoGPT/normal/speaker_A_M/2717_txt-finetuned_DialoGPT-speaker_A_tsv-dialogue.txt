A|17| A: [I don't] [see] someone _not_ going out there _and_ committing murder because they're afraid they're going _to_ _get_ sentenced _to_ death _. _I_ mean ,_ most _people_ out there committing murders [don't] care .

B|26| M: Wow . 
A|27| A: [Well [,] it's] [kind of [,] it's] [kind of] moved up _and_ _you have to_ remember [that] [it] [, it] [, it] _, uh ,_ _there's_ [, I think] , X number [of] _people_ out there [that] are going _to_ commit murders ,

B|44| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|45| A: [and [,] uh ,] [this] man [was] accused [of] killing [, uh [, I] think it was] two [people] [, uh [,] and] shooting [a [, uh] ,] policeman , um , point blank _in_ [the] face . Of course he didn't die . 
B|46| M: _Oh ,_ really . 
A|47| A: _And [, uh_ ,] [this] [was] during [a] holdup [of] [a [, uh] [,] uh [,] a] restaurant [and] [it] came out during [the] trial [that ,] um , _they_ _had_ tried [to] rob another place [and [,] uh ,] when [the] [guy] came out [with] [the] bag _they_ _thought_ [was] money [, it] turned out [to be a] couple cookies [, [and] [,] uh [,] you know ,] jumbo cookies [and , and] [so] _they were_ [so] upset from robbing [this] [guy] [, you know ,] trying [to] _do this_ holdup [that] didn't work [that] _they_ quite literally _were_ mad [and] went into [a] restaurant [to] hold [the] place up [and] [just] started [, you know ,] shooting [people] . 
B|48| M:  !!! ; !! % !! translated !!?!! Auto !! Remind [me] . 
A|49| A: [You know] [it's ,] 
B|50| M: [and , and] [that] [was] [the] second [time] [that [I] _had] to go_ [in] [and [they] were] [already] telling [me [,] you] [can't] [do this] . 
A|51| A: [Yeah [.] Yeah [,] and] [get] even [with] who _, I mean ,_ 
B|52| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of] [that] . 
A|53| A: [you know ,] stupid guys _And [, uh_ [,] it] turned out [that] [the [,] you know ,] policeman survived [to] [the] point [that] he [was] _able [to_ [,] you know ,] identify [the] [guy] . 
B|54| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|55| A: [And] [of] course [, you know ,] [they] tried [to] make [the] cop look [like] he [was [,] uh [,] a [, uh] ,] no [good] rotten drunk . 
B|56| M: [Yeah _, yeah] ._ 
A|57| A: _I mean_ [it was] amazing . 
B|58| M: [Well _,] _that's_ [,_ that] [is] [a [,] a] frightening [thought] . 
A|59| A: [Oh ,] he [was] found guilty [, yeah .] 
B|60| M: [And , uh] . 
A|61| A: He [, uh ,] um , last [I] heard , he [, uh ,] he beat [a] push for [the] death penalty . Now whether [they] finally got [it] or _not_ [, I don't [know] .] 
B|62| M: [Yeah , [I] [know] [,] I mean _,] I ,_ I'm [not] [real] sure [that , uh] . 
A|63| A: [I] [kind of [,] uh ,] stopped listening after [a] while . 
B|64| M: [Yeah .] 
A|65| A: Um [, you know ,] he [would] come home [and , [and] [,] you know ,] after [the] trial [was] over he came home [and] told us what [was] going on [and] [of] course then [they] [had to go] back [to] [you know ,] after he [had to go] , 
B|66| M: Okay . 
A|67| A: [Right .] [And [, uh] [,] yeah] everybody , everybody [was] pretty much [, you know ,] let's burn him . 
B|68| M: [Yeah [, yeah] .] 
A|69| A: [And] [that's [,] you know [,] that's] [the] [way] [they] wanted [to] [do] [it .] [And] he [was] surprised because he [thought] there [was] going [to be a] problem because he [, uh [,] you know] some [people] on [the] case [were] , [were] [a] little hesitant on convicting him on some [of] [the] charges _but [I_ mean] when [it] all came down , [they] [just] , within an hour decided [the] man's fate . 
B|70| M: [Yeah .] 
A|71| A: [Yeah .] 
B|72| M: [You [know] [,] I think] [that [,] you [have] [a] [,] you] can [have] civil rights [, but] [it's] [not] equal [to] equal rights . 
A|73| A: [Yeah , yeah] , well [, it] [, it] [, it] went pretty , pretty quick from what he said . 
B|74| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|75| A: [But] [I mean] [there's] , [there's] , [there's a lot of] other crimes out there [, I mean] besides murder [, I think] [, uh ,] now [if] [you're] dealing drugs now , caught [more] than twice or something [, uh [,] it] , [there's] [, uh [,] a] death penalty associated [with] [it .] 
B|76| M: [Right .] 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: [I mean [,] you] [can't] imagine [that [,] you] could [, you] couldn't imagine [a [,] a [,] you] , [you're] [not] [a] hero [, you] [don't] [, you] wouldn't [be] [able to] [kill] [, uh] 
A|79| A: [Yeah , yeah] [, I] agree . 
B|80| M: _I _,_ I [,_ I don't [know] [,] I] feel [like] , I'm [not] saying [that] [it's] right [, but [I] think] [that [,] [that] , uh] . 
A|81| A: [Yeah , I] agree [, I ,] I've [, I] [have] [, uh [,] a] low tolerance for [that] [kind of [,] uh [,] that] [kind of] [person] . [And [, uh] ,] as far as [, uh [,] you know] there are some , some other crimes [that [I] think] [, uh [,] you know [,] uh ,] kidnapping , um [, you know ,] when [they] [, I mean] kidnapping per se has [a] certain [, uh [,] uh ,] fine [and] penalty associated [with] [it] , 
B|82| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue . 
A|83| A: [but] , um , some [of] these [people] are [just] out [and] out brutal [. [I] ,] some [of] [the] cases I've heard about over [the] years ,
