A|51| A: You [have] [to] . [Because] there's [always] _more_ things [to do] . 
B|52| M: [I think it] [would] [be] [nice] if [we] [could get] [more] people involved [in the] work force , 
A|53| A: There [is] [always] things [that] [you] can make priority [to] [it] [but I] [just [,] I don't] demand [a] lot for myself [and so] _you [know_ [,] I] [just] feel entitled [to] [it] 
B|54| M: [Uh-huh] . 
A|55| A: [and] [I] [take] [it] [so .] 
B|56| M: Well [, [it's] just [,] you know] [it's ,] [it] [is] [just] [a] , [it [just] is] [a] problem . 
A|57| A: [No , I've] done some walking with friends [in the] past .
