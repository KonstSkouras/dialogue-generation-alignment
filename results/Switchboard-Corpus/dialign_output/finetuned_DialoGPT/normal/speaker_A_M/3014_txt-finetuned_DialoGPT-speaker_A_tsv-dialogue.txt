B|48| M: [But] [, uh ,] _it's_ [a] hard question , [really] . _I mean_ [, _I] , I don't [know_ _, I] guess_ _I _,_ it_ [just] seems [like] there's [so] many cars [that] _I think_ _are_ [really] going _to go_ out _of_ style . 
A|49| A: _Sure ._ 
B|50| M: [it] _was_ not [, uh [,] _I] , I don't [know_ _, I] guess_ _it's_ because [it] _was_ [a] big [, uh] _large_ company [, _I] mean_ _, you_ _didn't_ _see_ _a lot of_ [, uh] _you know_ [you] couldn't _see_ [too] many people [that] worked _for_ [a] big company . 
A|51| A: _No_ thanks . That's right . 
B|52| M: _So_ [, _I] ,_ I'm not [really] sure _what_ [the] solution [to] [that] [is] . 
A|53| A: _Uh-huh_ , uh-huh . 
B|54| M: [I just] [, _I] , I_ felt [like] [, uh] . 
A|55| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|56| M: [and _I] think_ _one_ _of_ them _was_ [a] seventy-six Buick _and the_ other _one_ _was_ [a] eighty-seven . 
A|57| A: Wow . 
B|58| M: And [, uh ,] there _was_ no , 
A|59| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|60| M: And [so] we _had_ _to ,_ we _had_ _a _,_ _a_ ,_ we [bought] _a _,_ uh , a_ used , used [, uh] C _R_ X . It _was_ _a _,_ it_ _was_ [a] seventy-seven . 
A|61| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|62| M: _but_ [it] _was_ [a] [much] better _car_ than _what_ we _got_ . 
A|63| A: Who makes [that] [car] ? 
B|64| M: _Uh ,_ _it's_ _a _,_ it_ _was_ [a] demo . It _was_ demo'd at [a] _Ford_ dealership . 
A|65| A: [I mean] [but] where [are] _they ,_ where [are] _they ,_ [what] , [what] [is] their location , [is] [it [,] uh ,] Asian [or] [is] [it] European [or] _who_ , 
B|66| M: _Um ,_ _it's_ _, [it_ _,] it_ _was_ built _by_ [the] same people [who] built [the] Toyota Camry . 
A|67| A: _Oh [,_ it] [is] Japanese . 
B|68| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: _Okay ,_ 
B|70| M: [yeah] _, [and_ _I] _, I_ think_ [, _I] ,_ 
A|71| A: [I] [didn't] [know .] 
B|72| M: _Yeah ,_ [they] _had_ _a [,_ uh ,] [they ,] [they] _put_ out _a _,_ a_ paper release _on_ [, uh] _on_ , _on_ _, you know ,_ recycling _of_ plastic [, uh] magazines . 
A|73| A: [Uh-huh .] _Okay_ 
B|74| M: [but] [, uh] 
A|75| A: _Yeah [, I_ guess] [so _that's] true ._ [Yeah .] 
B|76| M: [But] [, uh] . 
A|77| A: If , [if] , [if] [I had] _the [car_ I] [wanted] . 
B|78| M: Uh-uh . 
A|79| A: Gee . 
B|80| M: Why not [just] pay [the car] insurance _and _,_ _and_ [,_ uh _,] that_ _would_ be [the] easy way . 
A|81| A: Probably , um [, uh ,] let's [see] _, I _like_ the_ looks _of the_ Lincoln Town [car] 
B|82| M: [Yeah .] 
A|83| A: [But] [I , I don't know] [the] performance _of it ._ That's [a ,] [Ford] product , 
B|84| M: [Yeah .] 
A|85| A: [and [,] you [know [,] I] would] get hung up [by] [my] boot straps [if] [I] [if] [I ever] mentioned [the] [Ford] product [in] [my] family . 
B|86| M: [Right .] 
A|87| A: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
B|88| M: And [, uh [,] you] [would] _think_ [that] [they] [would] make quality products .

B|96| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|97| A: [Uh ,] now color preferences [, I think] [I would] opt [to go] [with] [a] bronze . Which [is] [probably] closest [to] gold [that] [you] can get 
B|98| M: [Uh] . 
A|99| A: [Yeah .] 
B|100| M: [uh ,] _I've_ [had] _a lot of_ luck [with] ours . We've [had] _, uh , a_ couple [of] ours fail . One [of] them [was] [a] little light [, uh] [uh [,] uh] [a] little dented piece [of] glass [and the] other [one] [was] [a] piece [of] tin [, uh] . 
A|101| A: [Right] [, well ,] [practical] yes [that's] , [Uh-huh .] [Right] [and it's] cooler [I] believe _, too_ , when [you're] driving [in] ,
