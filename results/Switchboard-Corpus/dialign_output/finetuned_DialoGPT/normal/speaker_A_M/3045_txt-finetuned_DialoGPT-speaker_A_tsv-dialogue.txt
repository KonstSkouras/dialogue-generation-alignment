B|42| M: No [, I] haven't . 
A|43| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|44| M: _But [,_ uh [,] I] haven't _used _it_ _,_ I don't _know_ _,_ I just_ remember seeing [an] ad [for] [it] [and] thinking _it was_ _really great ._ 
A|45| A: _Right ._ 
B|46| M: [And] _it's_ [really] _, it_ [really] [is] _. I mean_ , _I've_ [, I] can't remember [what] [the] name [of] _it [is_ [,] but] _it's_ [like] [, uh _,] it was_ [like] _, it_ _had a_ hard-core type _of thing_ _, you know ,_ [like] theakers [and] _all that_ . 
A|47| A: _Yeah , yeah ._ That's probably where you've [used _it] ._ 
B|48| M: It's _, it was_ [really] weird . 
A|49| A: [Uh-huh .] _Yeah_ . Um [, I] [have] [that] [on] my [, uh ,] [computer] _here and_ also [, um] _, I do_ some work at U T D [and [, uh] ,] [that's] [what] [they have] there [and] [it was] [just] [so] nice [to be] able [just] [to] step _into_ [the] position [and , and] already [know] [the] [you know ,] already [know] _the , the_ software . [And] [, um] [, I don't know] from my own experience [, um] , WordPerfect [is] [just] [so] [much] better than , than Wordstar at least [the] version [of] Wordstar [that] [I] [used to] [have] . It may [be] improved by now [but ,] 
B|50| M: [Uh [,] yeah] [, _I] mean_ _, it's _,_ I'm not_ [, _I] _, I_ think_ _it's_ [been] _for a number of _years_ [,_ [but] [,] um] . 
A|51| A: _Yeah [,_ it's [,] uh ,] Wordstar [was] never very intuitive [to] [me [.] I mean] [you know _,] you ,_ some [of the] commands [just] [had] nothing [to do] with [, you know ,] [what] [you] were supposed [to be] doing [what] [they] , [what] [they] did [on] [the computer] [but , uh ,] 
B|52| M: [Right [.] _I] , _I_ [,_ um] [. [I] do] [know] _a little_ bit _about_ [it _.] _I'm_ _, I'm_ _a_ computer_ scientist . 
A|53| A: [I mean] [like] [going] [, um] , forward [and] backward [a] word [or] up [and] _down_ [a] line [that] sort [of thing] [just] [, you know ,] didn't match with [the] kinds [of] keys [, you] were using . 
B|54| M: [Uh [,] yeah .] 
A|55| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|56| M: [and] _so [,_ [I] mean] _, I was_ [like] , [no] [, I don't [know] _,] I just_ [go] ahead [and] type [it] _out_ , you're [just] [like] , okay , I'll sit [down] [here and] _do _it_ , you_ [don't] _have [to_ _do] [it_ .] 
A|57| A: [And] [, but] WordPerfect [is] [just] [a lot] [more] intuitive [in] [a lot of] ways . [And] _you [,_ and] [it] _does a lot of_ things _too_ [that] _if_ _you _,_ if_ [you] [do] _any_ [kind [of [,] uh] ,] research [or] anything [like] [that] where _you [have_ [to] [, uh] ,] [use] footnotes [, it is] [just] wonderful . Because [it] [keeps] track [of] [all] _your_ footnotes . 
B|58| M: [Right .] 
A|59| A: _Yeah [,_ and] _if_ [you] add [it _,] if_ [you] put [a] footnote [in] , [in] [the] middle _, you know , if_ [you] come up with some new piece [of] documentation [and] [you] put [that] [in] [the] middle [of] _your_ [paper] [and] [have to] footnote [it , you] [just] change [, um] [, it] [just] automatically changes [all] _your_ footnoting numbers [for] [you] . 
B|60| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|61| A: [So [,] you know [,] it's] [just] , 
B|62| M:  !!! % !! ; !! Remind [me] [of] [that] 
A|63| A: _Yeah_ . _Yeah_ . [And] [I think] [about] [how] [it used to be] _if_ [you] were doing [a] [paper] [and] [you] [had to] [go] _back_ [and] retype everything [, and] oh [, it was] [just] awful . [So [,] um] [, I don't know] [I think] [we] [have] [just] become [really] spoiled . [But] [I think] [, it's a] nice [kind of] [way [to] be] spoiled 
B|64| M: [Yeah _,] I think_ [so] [too] . 
A|65| A: [So [,] um] , well [, I] [have] [not really] paid [much] attention because [I] clock , although [I think] we've probably [been] talking at least ten minutes [so , um] _, if_ _you [,_ um] , unless _you have_ some other things [you] want [to] talk [about] [as] having [to do] with P C 
B|66| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|67| A: [Well [,] um] [, I was] [a] technical writer [for] many [years [,] um] , 
B|68| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|69| A: [and] my husband [and] [I] actually met [in] [a computer] company . Um [, I was] [a] tech writer [and he] [was] [an] engineer . [And] [, uh ,] [so] [I] did tech writing [for a number of years] . 
B|70| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|71| A: [Oh ,] [sure] . 
B|72| M: [So [,] uh] . 
A|73| A: Got [a] problem , huh ? Um , 
B|74| M: No [, _I] [, I_ do] [, uh] 
A|75| A: [Oh] . Trying [to] figure [out] [what] [all that] [was] [about] , huh ? 
B|76| M: [Yeah [,] the , the] telephone . 
A|77| A: [But [,] um] [, I] [have] [, um] _, that , that_ [was] [the] majority [of] my writing although [, um] [, I] [have] also done oh , free lance magazine writing [and] some educational writing . [And] [, um] , [for a] while [I] [had [a] [,] um] [, uh ,] [a] partnership with [a ,] [in] [an] advertising agency with another woman who [is [a] ,] [an] artist . [So] [I] did some advertising [and] P R [but ,] 
B|78| M: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
A|79| A: [um] , now [I'm ,] actually [I'm [, I'm] not] working anymore [. [I'm] a] student [, I'm a] graduate student [so] [I'm] doing [a lot of] writing [but , uh ,] now [all] [of the] scholastic majors though , 
B|80| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: [I've] done [a little] , [a lot of] different kinds [, but] [I [, I] just] [know] right now [that] [I] [couldn't] [have] put [out] half [of] [what] [I] did _if_ [that] [much] without [the] being [in] computers [so] [that's] [been] [really great .] [And] [, uh , [I'm] ,] [so] [I'm] real spoiled . 
B|82| M: [Yeah , yeah .] 
A|83| A: [Yeah] . 
B|84| M: It's [, uh] 
A|85| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . 
B|86| M: It's [just] [that] [I'm] [so] anxious [to] [get] [back] [into] [it _,] to_ [get] [it] [going] again . 
A|87| A: Good . 
B|88| M: [so] she's [learned] [how] [to do] _that and_ she's [got] [the] same level [of] interest [, you know ,] [as] [I do] . 
A|89| A: That's [great .] 
B|90| M: [So [,] uh ,] [I've] [got] two [little] kids [and , uh] [they're] both [in] preschool .

B|94| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [So [,] um] [, I think] [that] _that would be_ [a] real , [a] real [, uh ,] advantage [to [,] _to] her_ [to] [have] [that [and] [, uh] ,] [do it] early , 
B|96| M: [Uh-huh .]

B|106| M: That [, that , [that] would be] , that'd [be] [the] only [thing] [, I] guess [, that] [we] [would] [do] [to her] , [is [,] you know , if] [we] [could] [just] [have] [her] [, you ,] [know ,] [like] [your] grandmother , [or] whatever . 
A|107| A: [Well ,] Nola [I] [have] enjoyed talking with [you] thoroughly . [This] [is] [really] [going [to] _be] fun_ [I think] ,
