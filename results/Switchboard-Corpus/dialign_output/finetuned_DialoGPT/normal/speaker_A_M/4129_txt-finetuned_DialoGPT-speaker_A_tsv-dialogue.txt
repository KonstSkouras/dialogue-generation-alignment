B|18| M: and [, uh _, I] don't_ know , _it's_ [, it] just [, I think] _it's_ [a] problem [that] we've got [to] address . 
A|19| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|20| M: _but _,_ you_ know [, I] _, I don't_ _see_ [the] problem [with] [it .] 
A|21| A: Um _, that's_ probably _true_ _, but_ [I] guess _there's_ other factors _that ,_

B|24| M: Uh-uh [. Right] . 
A|25| A: _but it's not_ going _to ,_ [Oh [,] I] [see] . 
B|26| M: It's [not] just [the school] systems [, I] mean _, there's_ been things done [to] try [to ,] [to] slow down [the] rate [of] [crime] and _I'm sure_ [that] [that] has [not] been , 
A|27| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: And [, uh] [they] just , [they] just seem [to] fit right [in] [with] [the] society and , and _I don't_ know what [they] can do [to] fix [it .] 
A|29| A: Um . 
B|30| M: And [, uh] . 
A|31| A: So _that's a_ difficult _situation_ . 
B|32| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh _, yeah ._ 
A|33| A: Um . 
B|34| M: and [I think] they're _a lot_ [more] hardened , and they're , they're [more] [, uh ,] they've done [more] , 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [But [,] uh , I] [, I think] [that [,] that] we're [in a] _, [in_ a] [situation] where we need [to] change [the] [way that] people [think] _about_ [it .] 
A|37| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|38| M: We're supposed [to [be] the] masters [of] [the] social [, uh] 
A|39| A: [Well _,] that's_ probably _true ._ 
B|40| M: [Yeah [,] _but] [,_ uh] . 
A|41| A: Um [, yeah] [, I] guess _that's_ [not] an easy solution . There's [, there's] no easy solution _for_ _that ._ 
B|42| M: No . 
A|43| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|44| M: or _you_ could just hire people [that] are trained [to] do [that .] [I] mean , [they] could _, you_ know , train them [to] do [it [,] _but] [,_ uh _,] you_ can't just hire them and then _, you_ _, you_ _have_ [to] train them . You _have_ [to be] able [to] train [the] people [that] do [it .] 
A|45| A: [I'm sure] [it] [is] [, yeah .] 
B|46| M: [But] [I] don t remember [if] [it's] [, [if] it was] just [, if] [they] gave him [a] scholarship [, if] he'd [be] [in] [good] standing , and _, you_ know , he'd get some [money] [for] [it [,] [but] it's not] like [they] can just send him [to] anybody else . 
A|47| A: Um [, yeah] [, I don't] [, I don't] , certainly capital punishment isn't going [to] solve [a lot] [of] problems 
B|48| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh [, I think] [that [,] uh ,] 
A|49| A: [but ,] 
B|50| M: [I don't] know . 
A|51| A: _Uh_ , 
B|52| M: [Uh] . 
A|53| A: [I] guess [I] am [for] certain 
B|54| M: [Yeah] . 
A|55| A: [yeah] [, in] certain crimes . 
B|56| M: [Yeah [,] I think] [that's] [true .]
