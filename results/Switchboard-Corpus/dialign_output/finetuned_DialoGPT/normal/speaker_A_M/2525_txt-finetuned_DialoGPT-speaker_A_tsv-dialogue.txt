B|0| M: Well , you're _not_ _going_ _to have to_ worry _too much_ _about_ _that _,_ because_ _, uh ._ 
A|1| A: Some buildings _do_ _, it_ depends _on_ _the_ location . The area _I_ live _in_ _right_ _now_ , _is ,_ _is_ _real good_ _as_ far _as_ _crime_ rate _is_ concerned _and_ _we_ _don't have_ _anything_ _at all_ , no burglar alarms , no guards . 
B|2| M: _Um ._ 
A|3| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|4| M: _But_ _, uh ._ 
A|5| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|6| M: [and] _it's_ _just [,_ it] _just_ seems _like_ there's _just_ _a lot_ _more_ _of_ _the _,_ the_ _people ,_ _more_ _of_ _them_ _, you_ _get_ _a lot_ , 
A|7| A: _Uh-huh ._ [Um .] 
B|8| M: _but_ _they're_ still _, they're_ trying _to_ fill [the] gap . 
A|9| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|10| M: _So_ _, uh ._ 
A|11| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|12| M: _I mean _,_ you know _,_ you_ hear _about_ _people_ selling _their_ babies _to_ support _their_ family _, you_ [don't] hear _about_ kids _being_ involved [in] drug crimes _, you_ _mean_ ? 
A|13| A: _Oh , yeah _,_ yeah ._ 
B|14| M: [I] [don't] _think_ _that's_ _a_ [good] thing . 
A|15| A: _Uh-huh ._ There's _a lot _of_ that_ _going on_ [in] Dallas , [too] . 
B|16| M: _Yeah , it's_ _, it is_ scary . 
A|17| A: [Yeah , it's] _really_ sad . 
B|18| M: _It_ [is _,] _it is_ ._ 
A|19| A: _Uh-huh_ , _Uh-huh ._ 
B|20| M: [I] [don't] _, I_ don _, _I_ _,_ _I_ think _that_ _, that_ _,_ uh_ _you know_ _I think_ [it's] important _to have_ children . 
A|21| A: _Oh [,_ _I] agree_ _. [I_ think that] _people are_ getting off [too] easy . They're getting [, they're] getting paroled [too] easily . 
B|22| M: Well [, _I] ,_ 
A|23| A: They're [just] getting _, uh ,_ _put_ _on probation_ _or_ _something_ [, because] [the] prisons _don't have_ enough room _so_ _they_ [get] _, they_ [get] lighter sentences , 
B|24| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh , uh-uh 
A|25| A: [and] some [of] those [people _,] they don't_ deserve [to] _be_ let loose . 
B|26| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|27| A: _Oh _, yeah_ ._ 
B|28| M: _So_ _, you_ could tell [they] _had_ _gotten_ away _from_ [the] [real] world [and] _were_ living [in] [a] [real] world _, you_ knew . 
A|29| A: _Oh_ my gosh . 
B|30| M: _Uh _,_ _and_ _,_ uh ._ 
A|31| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|32| M: _So_ _, I guess _,_ you know _,_ you_ _, you_ [don't] want [to] say _, you_ want _to _,_ you_ can't say [that] [they] _were_ [in] _there_ _for_ _life_ _, _but_ they_ _were_ certainly _not_ _for_ saving [the] _country_ . 
A|33| A: [Uh _,] that's_ terrible . 
B|34| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|35| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|36| M: _So_ [, [I] think] [that's] [a] _big_ problem . 
A|37| A: [Yeah .] 
B|38| M: _and I_ [don't] _know what_ [the] answer _is ._ 
A|39| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|40| M: [and] [so] [the] person [that's] committing _the crime_ [is] [going] _, well , _I_ mean_ [I think] [they] _should_ [be] punished , 
A|41| A: [Yeah .] 
B|42| M: It's _like_ [, uh _,] you_ _see_ [the] same thing _happen_ _with_ [the] kids , you're _like_ _, well , you_ got _to do_ [something] [to] [get] _them_ _to do_ . 
A|43| A: Right [, _it's] a_ little [more] understandable under [the] circumstances [, I guess] . 
B|44| M: Uh-uh _. But_ [, _I] [,_ [I] think] [, _I] mean _,_ you_ [just] _have to_ _take_ _what_ [they] say [at] face value , you're _not_ [going] [to] [get] [anything] _out_ _of it ._ 
A|45| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|46| M: _And_ [I] don [, I] don's _that [,_ that's] _, that _would_ be_ _fair_ _, but_ [I think] _the _,_ the_ problem [is] _that ,_ um _, you know _,_ the [,_ uh] _the [,_ _I] [,_ I] [really] [don't] _see_ [the] problem _with_ _it [._ _I] [,_ uh] 
A|47| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|48| M: _And_ [I think] _, uh ._ 
A|49| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|50| M: _And_ _, _and_ _,_ you know [,_ that's] [a] _big_ problem [. I] [don't] _know [,_ [I] think] there's [so] _much_ wrong _with_ [the] system , um _, you_ _, you_ [have] [people] who [are] , who [are] abusing [the] systems [and] who [are] committing crimes _that _,_ you_ can't _, you_ [don't] want _them_ _out_ [of] society _for_ _any_ length [of] time . 
A|51| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|52| M: _and [,_ uh ,] [so] _, you know [,_ [I] think] [that's] , _I'm not sure_ [that's] [right] . 
A|53| A: Right _, _we_ have_ enough , enough problems [with] overcrowding [in] [the] jails _as_ [it is .] [So] let , let [their] [country] [take] _care_ [of it .] 
B|54| M: [Yeah _,] well [,_ we] , we're _not_ doing _that ._ We're [, we] [are] trying _to [,_ uh [,] uh [,] I] [don't] _know ,_ [to] make _it [,_ uh] 
A|55| A: We _don't have_ [, I guess] [too much] trouble [in] Dallas [with] [, well [, I] guess [,] I guess] [we] [do] _have _a_ lot of people_ come [in] [from] Mexico [, that] cause problems [, _but] [, uh_ .] 
B|56| M: Uh-uh . [Yeah .] 
A|57| A: [Yeah .] _Uh-huh ._ 
B|58| M: _And_ , uh-hue [, [I] think] [that's] probably [the] most common example _, and [I_ think] [, uh] _that's the_ most prevalent problem . 
A|59| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|60| M: _and I_ don , _I'm not sure_ [that] [they're] [as] , [as] close [as] [we] might [have] [with] [the] domestic political situation . 
A|61| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|62| M: _And_ [they're] still raping [people] [and] killing [people] _and _,_ you_ can't even imagine _that ._ 
A|63| A: _Uh-huh ._ [It] was amazing [I] went [to] [the] Far East [, uh ,] _back_ [in] October [to do] some training [for] T [I] [and [I] ,] 
B|64| M: [Uh ,] 
A|65| A: [uh ,] some [of] those countries [were] [so] safe [, it] was unreal . Singapore [is] very , supposed [to] [be] very safe [and ,] [in] fact , Tokyo [, and I] thought Tokyo [would be] dangerous [being] such [a] huge large city [with] [so] many [people ,] 
B|66| M: [Yeah .] 
A|67| A: [but _they] ,_ [at] , [at] [the] T [I] [there] [, _I] said_ [is] [there] [any] area [I] [should] avoid . [And] [the] guy _said_ let _me_ ask another girl here _and he_ turned [and] asked this girl [, and] _said ,_ _can_ [you] [think] [of] [any] place where Dana shouldn't _go_ by herself , _or_ [anything] . [And] she , she thought [for] [a] few minutes [and] she _said ,_ no . [And] _he_ _said_ [is] [there] [any] place [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself . She _said ,_ no . _And they_ _said [,_ it is] [so] safe [there] [that] _you can_ leave your purse _on_ [the] subway 
B|68| M: [Uh] . 
A|69| A: [and] _somebody_ will turn [it] [in] _and , and_ nothing will [be] missing . They _said_ [they] _can_ [just] [about] guarantee [that] [there] _, that [, that_ would] [happen] _if _you_ did_ [that [.] I] thought , boy , [in] America , _if you_ left [a] purse _on_ [a] subway [, _you] would_ never [see] [it] _again_ . 
B|70| M: [Yeah [,] yeah .] 
A|71| A: [Yeah [,] that's] true , 
B|72| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|73| A: [that's] true [. _But] I_ was _thinking_ boy , [in] Dallas , _if_ _somebody_ asked [me] _if_ [there] [were] places [you] wouldn't _go_ by yourself [at] night , I'd [have to] set [them] down [for] [about] five _or_ ten minutes [to] list _all_ [the] places [out] . 
B|74| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: _I mean , I_ couldn't believe [that] she couldn't [think] [of] [any] place . They _said [,_ the ,] apparently [the crime] , [is ,] [just [,] uh ,] 
B|76| M: _Oh , yeah , [I_ mean _,] you know [,_ that , that] [just] doesn't make sense [to] [me] either . 
A|77| A: [I'm not sure] [what] [it is] [there] . Now [, I] [know what] [it is] [in] Singapore , [is] [they] _have the_ death penalty [and] [they] [really] enforce [it ,] 
B|78| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: [like] [for] drugs , [for] drugs _they , they_ enforce [the] death penalty [for] [that _.] Uh [,_ they're] [just ,] very , very tough [, and [I] guess] maybe [that's the] way Tokyo [is] [too] , _or_ Japan [is] [too] . They're [just] very tough _on_ criminals . 
B|80| M: [Yeah [,] well] [I _,] you know [,_ I] [don't] [know] [if] [I agree] [with] [that] [or] [not] . 
A|81| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|82| M: [I] [don't] [think] [we [have] the] [right] system [to do] [it .] 
A|83| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|84| M: [And] [, uh .] 
A|85| A: [Uh-huh] , oh [yeah .] 
B|86| M: [And they] [put] [them] [in] [there] [for] twenty years [and] [they're] still [going on] . 
A|87| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|88| M: Like [I [said] [,] [I] [,] I] [really] [don't have] [any] problem [with] [it [.] Uh ,] 
A|89| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|90| M: [So] [, [I] mean , [I] [,] I] [don't] [know] . 
A|91| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|92| M: [And] [, uh [,] I] [don't] _know [,_ [I] think] [there] [are] certain crimes _that are_ [, _that] are_ beyond [, uh] [uh ,] rehabilitation . 
A|93| A: Right [, and] [if] [they're] overcrowded _, well , you know_ [they] shouldn't [have] [gotten] theirself [there] [in] [the] first place . 
B|94| M: [Yeah .] 
A|95| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [and] [you] can't say [, well] [you know] you're sorry [, and] then [you can] [go] [back] [and] say [, [you] did] [something] wrong [and] you're [not] guilty , you're [, [you] can] still [be] tried [again] [, and] [you can] [be] tried [for] [the] same [crime] [again] , 
A|97| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [And] [, [and] [,] uh] [you know] [it's] [just [,] I] [don't] [know] . 
A|99| A: [Oh , yeah , [I] agree] [, because] [it's] [not] [fair] [to] those [of] us [that , that] deserve [a] safe [, you know ,] [life] _to have to ,_ 
B|100| M: [Yeah .] 
A|101| A: Right .

A|103| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: [And [they] , they] [just [,] they don't] [care] . 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [and , and] [so] [I think] [they're] [thinking] [, well [, you know] [,] you] , you've got [to [have] a] deterrent [, and] we've got [a lot of people] _that are_ breeding [them] [so] [that [,] uh [,] they] can't [get] [out] [of [that] .] 
A|107| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|108| M: [And] [, uh [,] I] [don't] [know] [if] we've ever _had_ [a] , [a] [real good] example [but , uh] 
A|109| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|110| M: [But [I] think] [, [I] think] [they're] [really] [going] [to have to [,] [I] [,] I] [don't] [know [,] I] [just ,] [I'm] beginning [to] [think [that] [, that] ,] um [, that] [a lot of [people] are] [just] [not] [real] informed [about] [what] , what's [going on] . 
A|111| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|112| M: [and he] [just ,] [he] [just] got caught . 
A|113| A: Right , [not] [much] . 
B|114| M: [Yeah .] 
A|115| A: [Yeah ,] huh-uh [, and] especially [not] [in] some [of] these [big] cities , [like] [in] Dallas [I mean] they've [had] [, they're] up [in] [the] top , top five [I think] [of] cities [that are] getting policeman killed [on] , [on] , [in] [the] line [of] duty [and] [that's] [really] sad . 
B|116| M: Well [, [I] think] [that's] [a] [, that's] [not] [a] [good] thing [, [I] mean , I] [don't] [think] [it's a] [good] idea [at all] . 
A|117| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|118| M: [And] [, uh [,] [I] mean] [it's] [, it's] [just [,] you know [,] I] [don't] [know [,] it] [just] seems [like] [, you] [just] [don't] [, you] [don't] want [to] over kill [somebody] [just] [because] [they're] black [or] [you know] 
A|119| A: [Uh-huh .]
