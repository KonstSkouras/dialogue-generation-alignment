B|34| M: _Yeah [, I_ [, [I] think] that , uh] . 
A|35| A: Long way _, uh ,_ 
B|36| M: _Oh_ . 
A|37| A: [And] _we_ [just] _had_ [a] [really] _big_ ice storm . [And ,] basically , _half_ [the] trees [in] , [in] our city [, I'm in] Rochester which _is_ [, uh] right upstate . Half [of] [the] trees [in the] city _, uh ,_ are _no_ _good_ anymore . 
B|38| M: _Yeah [, I_ think] [we had] _about_ [four] inches [of] snow _on_ [the] ground [in] _about_ [, uh] [uh ,] [this] evening . 
A|39| A: [That's] how bad _it was_ . Everything _is_ [just] down everywhere . 
B|40| M: _Oh [, yeah_ .] 
A|41| A: _You_ _know _,_ [we_ had] three hundred thousand people without power . 
B|42| M: [Yeah .] 
A|43| A: _You_ _know _,_ it was _,_ [and_ _,] you _know_ _,_ [and_ _,] and_ _they_ _, and_ [we] didn't _have_ power _for_ [a] week [and] there are still people who _don't_ _have_ power . 
B|44| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|45| A: [Oh , _yeah] _,_ it's_ _been_ _, it's_ _been_ _, it's_ _been_ ten days already [and] there are still something like ten thousand people without power . 
B|46| M: [Yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and] were officially [, _yeah] _,_ and_ _we're_ officially [in] [a] state [of] emergency . Funny thing _is_ [the] news , [the] national news how _they_ covered _it_ . Uh , 
B|48| M: [Oh] . 
A|49| A: [Yeah _.] [I_ think] _it_ made [about] three minutes [on] one [of] [the] national news stations or something [and _,] and_ _we've been_ [in] [a] state [of] emergency _for_ over _, you _know_ ,_ _for_ ten or eleven days .

B|52| M: [Oh [,] my] gosh . 
A|53| A: Because _we have _,_ you _know_ ,_ everywhere [that] [a] tree _is_ down people need help [and ,] _we're_ [all] , [all] _, _a_ lot of_ older folks need help getting , their yards cleaned out _because_ _they_ can't afford _to_ _pay_ anyone 
B|54| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|55| A: [and] _they_ _, [and_ _,] and_ _they_ certainly can't carry _it_ themselves 
B|56| M: [Yeah .] 
A|57| A: [and ,] _So ,_ 
B|58| M: [Well _,] that's_ [a] shame [because] [it's] [really] [, it's] [, it] [really] [is] _a problem ._ 
A|59| A: [Oh _,] that's great ._ 
B|60| M: It's [, it's] [just [,] uh] 
A|61| A: [And] [is] [that] supported by [all] donations _to_ [the] church [and] so forth or , 
B|62| M: [Yeah .] 
A|63| A: [Oh ,] so he , 
B|64| M: [So [,] you know] 
A|65| A: [That's] _real_ nice . 
B|66| M: [So [,] it's] [real] convenient _, too ._ 
A|67| A: Right . 
B|68| M: _But ,_ um , 
A|69| A: That [, that's] _real good_ . 
B|70| M: [And [, uh [,] [we] have] [,] uh] [had] [real _good] luck_ [with] [that .] 
A|71| A: [And [I] _,] and I_ bet [it] gives [you] [a] [real good] feeling _to be_ doing [that .] 
B|72| M: [Oh [,] it] sure does . 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] 
B|74| M: [and [,] uh , [I think] it's] helped [a lot] . 
A|75| A: [That's] [, that's [,] uh [,] that's] [real good] . 
B|76| M: [Yeah _,] it [,_ it] [really] [is] . 
A|77| A: _We_ [had] [, uh , [we] had] organizations like [that] [in] college [, you _know] _._ We_ [had] [a] community service group [in] college [that] [had] [all] sorts [of] different groups [and] some did like [that ,] some did elderly visits , 
B|78| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: some did [, uh ,] some did [, you _know] ,_ Big Brother , Big Sister , stuff like [that .] [And] [I'm] convinced [that [, that] , that] [at] least twenty-five percent [of] our school participated [in] some sort [of] _a ,_ some sort [of] group . _You_ _know ,_ activity like [that .] 
B|80| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: _You_ _know ._ Twenty-five [, _I] don't know ._ Twenty-five percent ? A asks someone else [in the] [Yeah [,] my] wife _was_ _big_ [in] [that] 
B|82| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|83| A: [And] she thinks [, _yeah] ,_ twenty-five percent . It _, it was_ [a] small school 
B|84| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|85| A: [But [,] uh ,] [Yeah ,] but [, I] mean _, _a_ , _a_ , _a_ lot of_ people [would] get involved [and [,] you _know] ,_ [because] there were [all] different , organizations _to do_ . There _was_ Big Brother , Big Sister , 
B|86| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: _they_ [had] [a] yearly auction , _they_ [had] [a] dance marathon _for_ charity or , _to_ , _to_ support [that ,] group . 
B|88| M: [Oh] . 
A|89| A: Such [that [,] you _know] ,_ lots [of] people got involved [that] way . 
B|90| M: [Well [,] that's great .] 
A|91| A: [Yeah .] 
B|92| M: [So [,] uh [,] it's] _, it [,_ it was [,] it] [had [to] _be] [a_ lot of] fun . 
A|93| A: [Yeah _,] no ,_ neither _do_ [I] _. [I_ think] [it] should [be] completely optional [and] [you _know] ._ 
B|94| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [Yeah ,] they're not worth [a] year . Or some people [just , just] can't even afford [it [,] you _know] ,_ whatever _. I_ mean , [the] Peace Corps doesn't _pay_ very _well_ . _You_ [know] ? 
B|96| M: [No] [, I [, I] think] [they] [do [,] I] [do] [think] [they] [pay] [a little] bit _too_ _much_ . 
A|97| A: People get shipped off [and] then [, you _know] _,_ and_ then _, and_ then their parents [, I] [have] _a [,_ uh _,] _a_ , a_ friend whose , whose son [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala , or daughter [is] [in the] Peace Corps [in] Guatemala right now . 
B|98| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|99| A: [And [,] you _know] ,_ he [and] his wife [just] went off [to] visit her [and [,] you _know] _, I_ know_ [I] could never afford [to] go visit [a] kid [in] Guatemala . 
B|100| M: [Yeah .] 
A|101| A: _You_ _know ,_ so 
B|102| M: [Yeah .] 
A|103| A: so [I think [,] you _know] _,_ [and_ _,] [and_ _,] and_ [the] kid's certainly not making [much] money . 
B|104| M: [No] [, no [,] no] . 
A|105| A: [So] [I] can see where [that [, that] ,] may [be [a] problem .] 
B|106| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|107| A: Just take off [a] year . 
B|108| M: [yeah [,] I [know] [, I] think] [that's] [a , [a] big] [problem] [, and [I] think it's [a] big] [part of] [it] _too ._ 
A|109| A: [Yeah , _I] don't_ , 
B|110| M: [I don't know .] 
A|111| A: [Yeah [,] [yeah] _,] well_ neither can [I ,] so [, I [, I] [, I] [, I] [, I] [, I] ,] did [my] service before [and] I'll [do] [my] [little] community service throughout , but never never _for_ [a] year again . 
B|112| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|113| A: [So ,] so [I guess] our vote [is] [no] 
B|114| M: [Yeah .] 
A|115| A: [Well [,] it's] _been_ nice talking [to] [you] again . 
B|116| M: [You] _too ._ 
A|117| A: [Well [,] [yeah] ,] _we're_ , _we're_ slowly getting everything back together again . [You] [know [,] it [,] it's] taking _time_ , but everything [, you [know] ,] 
B|118| M: It's hard [to] find [time] [for] [all] [of] us . 
A|119| A: [we] got _lucky _._ We_ [had] [no] damage [to] our _house_ or anything so , The rest will [just] [have] [to] come [with] [time] . 
B|120| M: [Yeah [,] well] [, we] , [we've been] [lucky [.] [I] guess] [, I guess] [we're] [just] [lucky] [to have] [been] able [to do] [that [.] We] [, uh , we] bought [a] new [house] [about] [two] [and] [a] [half] years ago . 
A|121| A: [Well ,] [good luck] [to] [you] [, too .] 
B|122| M: Okay , bye-bye . 
A|123| A: Bye-bye or
