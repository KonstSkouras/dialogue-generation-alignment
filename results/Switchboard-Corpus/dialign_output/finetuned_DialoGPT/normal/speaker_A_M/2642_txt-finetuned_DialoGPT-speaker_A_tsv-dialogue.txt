B|2| M: _Oh _,_ that's_ _not_ _bad_ . 
A|3| A: Because _I don't_ _like_ _credit cards_ _for_ _one_ thing _, you know _,_ I mean ,_ _they're_ _okay_ _, I guess ,_ _if_ _you're_ on _a_ trip _or_ something _, you don't have to_ take _a_ whole bunch _of_ _, you know ,_ cash _with _you_ ,_ 
B|4| M: Uh , no . 
A|5| A: _but_ _I don't_ _like_ using _them_ because _I've_ seen _too_ many people _that_ used _them_ _and_ ended up bankrupt _or_ on , chapter thirteen _and_ stuff _like_ _that ._ 
B|6| M: _Yeah ._

B|10| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|11| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|12| M: _So [,_ _I mean [,] I_ guess [,] _I] just _don't_ _know_ _._ _I_ _,_ I'm not_ [too] much _of a_ _person_ _that _,_ uh _, I_ _,_ uh_ [I] don tinker [with] [credit cards] [or] _anything_ . 
A|13| A: _Right ._ Are _you_ married ? 
B|14| M: No _, I'm not_ . 
A|15| A: _Oh , okay ._ _Well [,_ _I] know_ [that] _a lot_ [of] young people _, you know [,_ I _,] it_ took _me_ [a] long time _to_ _get_ _it_ through _my_ child's head [, I mean _,] that_ was her goal _, you know [,_ uh ,] _got to have a_ [credit] card , 
B|16| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue . 
A|17| A: _but_ now [that] she has _one_ , she's only used _it_ _one_ time _but_ she wanted _to_ establish some [credit] , 
B|18| M: [Right .] 
A|19| A: _but_ [I] think _it_ finally sunk in _, you know ,_ because she saw some [of] _the_ other people _and_ [just] _like_ she heard _them_ say _, you know _,_ well_ [, I] used [a] [credit] card _. And_ _my_ husband's sister _is_ _the_ world's worst at , oh _, well_ , _I'll_ [just] use _the_ [credit cards] _and_ she has all [of] her [credit cards] up _to_ _the_ limit . 
B|20| M: Uh , 
A|21| A: _You know _,_ _and_ I'm_ [, I'm] thinking woman , wake up _and_ smell _the_ roses before _they_ come _and_ _get_ _you ._ But ... 
B|22| M: [Yeah [,] I] agree [with you] there . 
A|23| A: [Right] _, and_ people [don't] see [that] either . 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|25| A: [Right .] The only _one_ [that] we , we _have_ [that] we kept was _the_ Discover card , 
B|26| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: _and_ _it_ pays [you] _to_ use _it [._ [I] mean ,] _if you_ _pay_ your _bill_ off right away , _if _you_ don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ any interest on _it_ because _they_ give [you] [a] certain _amount_ _every_ time [that] [you] use _it ,_ 
B|28| M: [Oh _,] that's_ good . 
A|29| A: _and_ [you] _make that_ _money_ as long as _you don't_ ever _have to_ _pay_ _them_ any [, uh ,] interest . Now _it's_ _, and_ people say _, well_ _, you _know ,_ I'm_ making _money_ by using this [credit] card _, but_ _they_ [don't] realize [that] _if_ _they_ [, I mean _,] it_ only takes _one_ time _for_ [you] _to_ use _it and_ [not] _pay_ _the_ interest [, I mean _,] you have to_ _pay_ _the_ interest , [not] _pay_ _it_ right off , 
B|30| M: [Right .] 
A|31| A: [that's] _going to_ take up _what_ [you] would _have_ made . 
B|32| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|33| A: [So] [that's] _the_ only reason [that] we kept [that ,] we debated _for_ [a] long time plus _they_ _don't have_ [that _,] um_ , _charge_ on _it _,_ you know ,_ _like_ ... 
B|34| M: [Well ,] [I've] never [, I] haven't [, I] never _, it's_ _always_ _been_ [like] [my] mom _always_ says [, well] [if you] [charge] [it [,] it] will _be_ automatically undoed , _so_ , 
A|35| A: [Yeah .] 
B|36| M: [Oh , okay .] 
A|37| A: [Right .] They _don't have_ _one_ [of] those . [So [,] [it] ,] we decided [that] was [it _,] you know _,_ and [,_ I mean ,] everybody calls us _and_ wants _to_ give us [a] [credit] card . We _have_ , we could _have_ [credit cards] running down our ears . 
B|38| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|39| A: Yes , yes _. _And_ then ,_ _I'll have_ , [just] _like [,_ uh ,] department stores . They'll call [me] up _, you know _,_ and_ _I'll_ say , look _, I don't_ want _the_ [credit] card [, well] , we're [just] _going to_ _send it_ _to _you_ _, you_ know _,_ you don't have to_ ever use [it] [if _you] don't_ want _to_ . They'll _send_ [me] any [credit] card [, I] tear [it] up [. [I] just] can't see _it ._ 
B|40| M: [Yeah [.] [I] _know] ._ 
A|41| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|42| M: [and] [then] [you have to] write [a] _check_ [for _it _.] And_ I just_ hate [them] . 
A|43| A: [I know] [it _,] and_ _you _know_ what_ ... 
B|44| M: [and] [then] [they] [send it] _back_ [to [you] .] 
A|45| A: What's really [bad] about those though _is_ [just] [like] young people [if] [they] [don't] _, you know ,_ we take _the_ time _to _, you_ know ,_ help [my] daughter , she's in college , 
B|46| M: Uh-uh . 
A|47| A: _but_ [it ,] this _is_ her first [credit] card thing [, well] , when she _got_ her first _one_ she was [so] excited [it] was unreal . Look at this [they] sent [me] this _money _,_ you [know_ .] [So] [then] when [I] explained [to] her , look [you have to] _pay_ this _back and_ [they] are _going to_ [charge] [you] interest _, and_ stuff , [of] course , she tore [it] up . But _a lot_ [of] parents would [not] take _the_ time _, you know _,_ and_ [they] wouldn't _even_ think [of] [it] [or] their kids may [not] [be] as close as [my] daughter _and I_ are _, and [,_ uh _,] you know ,_ [they] may [not] _even_ discuss [it ,] [they] _go_ out [and] cash their [check] thinking _that _, you_ know ,_ they've _got_ something , maybe they've won something . _You know ,_ somebody sent [them] something free . 
B|48| M: Uh , [I've] _had_ _, I have_ _had_ [a] couple [of] _credit cards [,_ and] [I've] [, [you] , you] [get] [one] [or] two bucks [for] [every] dollar [you] _spend_ [, and] [then] [you] [get] [, uh] [a lot] _more_ [for] [the] [amount] [you] _spend_ . 
A|49| A: [And] _go_ out [and] [spend] [it . _And] _,_ um_ [, it's] [just] unreal [. _I] mean , I don't_ [like] [credit cards [,] I] wish [that] [they] would come up [with] some other way _to _, you_ know ,_ [the] only way [you] could use [them] _is_ [if you] were , [like] on vacation . They would let [you] use [it] maybe once [a] _year_ . _You know [,_ I mean ,] [of] course [, I guess] some people _go_ out [and] [spend] their whole entire limit on [it] [like] [that] at [that] time _but _,_ um_ [, I have] seen [so] many people _and [I_ _have] a_ friend right now she [just] _got_ off [of] thirteen . She _got_ [, uh , I] can't remember _what_ she called [it [,] it's] some kind [of] , maybe [it's] _sure_ [or] something [like] [that [,] it's] something [, it's] some weird name [of a] [credit] card , 
B|50| M: [Yeah .] 
A|51| A: [and] she _is_ _charging_ out [of] her mind already _. And I'm_ _going_ [, you] [just] _got_ off . That's _how_ [you] _got_ on [to] [it] [to] start [with] _, you know ,_ _what_ _is_ [the] matter [with] this [person] , 
B|52| M: [Yeah .] 
A|53| A: But _, um_ [, it] seems [like] people [just] _, you know ,_ [they] [just] think [, well] [, _I] can_ [just] [have] [anything] [I] want [. And [I just] don't] see [it] [like] [that .] Of course [, I] [always] see _pay_ [the] bills first [and] whatever's leftover [, that's] _what_ [you have] _, but _,_ um_ , maybe [a lot] [of] people [don't] see [it] [like] [that _,] but_ [I] can't stand owing [. [I] mean , I] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe something _like _,_ you know [,_ I guess] [it's] [just] because [I've] [been] brought up [like] [that .] But _, um_ [, I] could [not] [charge] [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that] [I] was _going to have to_ _pay_ this thing out [for] ever [and] maybe suffer from having [to] payout . But [, that's] [just] [the] way [I] feel about [it .] 
B|54| M: [Yeah _, yeah] ._ 
A|55| A: [Right .] [yeah .] 
B|56| M: [And [,] you] don tinker [with] [it [and] [I] can] [always] tell [my] husband [, [you] ,] you've [got to have a] budget [and [,] _and ,] um_ . 
A|57| A: oh [, yeah [.] [I] guess] [it] _is_ [like] [that] though because [it] seems [like] [more] [and] [more] people are [like] [that .] But [, um] [, I guess] [it's] because [I'm] older [, I mean [,] I'm not] real old _but_ [I] am older [and , um] _, you know [,_ I] didn't feel [like] [that] [I] didn't feel [like] [I] [had] [to have] everything [. [I] guess] [it] was because [, well] [, I] [had] everything when [I] was at home _but_ [I _,] _I don't_ know_ why [I] didn't . 
B|58| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|59| A: uh-huh . 
B|60| M: [and I'm] [like [,] well] [then] [I'll [have] to] [make [that] [.] And I'm] [sure] [that , [you] ,] [you're] [not] [going to have [to] [, you] have to] [be] [, you don't have to] [spend] [that] much [money ,] 
A|61| A: [yeah .] 
B|62| M: [And then [,] you] [can] [go] [back and] [pay for it] again . 
A|63| A: Huh . 
B|64| M: [So [,] you know [,] that's] [, [that] [,] that] [is] [a] big problem . 
A|65| A: [Yeah [,] well] [, it] didn't hurt [you ,] did [it ,] [to [,] I mean [,] you] didn't [go] out [and] [charge] [a] whole bunch [and] lose everything , did [you] ? 
B|66| M: [Yeah .] 
A|67| A: [Yeah [,] well] [, you] learned [then ,] right ? 
B|68| M: [Yeah .] 
A|69| A: [Yeah .] 
B|70| M: [You know [,] that's] [not] , [you're] [, uh] 
A|71| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [I don't [know] [, I'm] not] [sure] [how] much [they're] [charging] per [year] per [year] [, but [,] [I mean ,] I don't] [even] [know] [if] [I [know] what] [my] total [bill] [is] per [year] [or] per month [or] [how] much [I'm] actually supposed [to] [be] getting paid [for it .]
