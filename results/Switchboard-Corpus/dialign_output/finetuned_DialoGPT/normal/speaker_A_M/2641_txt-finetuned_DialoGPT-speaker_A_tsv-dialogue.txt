B|0| M: _Oh ._ 
A|1| A: _so , I_ mean _, I'm_ _used_ _, I'm_ _used to_ _having_ _cats_ _around _,_ I_ _like_ _them ._ 
B|2| M: _Uh _,_ yeah_ . 
A|3| A: _Oh ,_ see _, I'm not_ _, uh _,_ I'm not_ _a dog_ person at _all_ 
B|4| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: _Yeah ,_ probably _, _I_ was_ allergic _to_ _dogs_ when _I _was_ a_ kid , _in_ fact , 
B|6| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|7| A: _I_ may _still_ _be _,_ um _,_ we ,_ 
B|8| M: _Well _,_ I , I have_ [a dog] _, and _I_ _,_ you know , we_ _went_ _out and_ bought him _, and_ _he_ [was] part Springer Spaniel , part Cocker Spaniel . 
A|9| A: That _, um [,_ I] _wonder_ sometimes 
B|10| M: _Well _,_ I don't know _, I , I_ have_ _a friend who_ _has a dog _and_ , uh ,_ he's always _had_ [dogs] , 
A|11| A: Um _, but _we_ _,_ um [,_ we] _house_ sat _for_ _a _,_ um _,_ my_ _, um _,_ my_ wife's boss [a] couple weeks _ago and _,_ um [,_ uh ,] [he] [has a dog and] everything [, _we] _were_ [,_ you know , _we] were_ sitting _the_ [dog and] everything [and _, uh ,] I_ felt _like_ _just_ miserable _all_ weekend _and _it_ really_ didn't dawn _on_ me until Sunday _, _it was_ like ,_ hey , maybe you're _still_ allergic _to_ _the_ _dog ._ It _was like ,_ oh _, that_ could _be_ _it ._ 
B|12| M: [Oh ,] no . 
A|13| A: [Yeah .] [Well ,] [dogs] _are_ _real_ high maintenances [, you] _got_ _to_ take _them_ _for_ walks [and] you've _got_ _to_ pay _a lot_ [, you know [,] you] need _to_ pay attention _to_ _cats_ [and] everything _but it's_ _not_ quite _the same_ _thing_ . 
B|14| M: _No _, it's_ [,_ [it] really] isn't . 
A|15| A: Um _, and _,_ um _,_ um [,_ you know [,] it's [,] _it's] just_ _nice_ _that_ _cats_ [, you know ,] _cats_ [, _yeah] _,_ you don't have to_ let _them_ outside [, you know ,] _all_ _cats_ _are_ indoor _cats_ , 
B|16| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|17| A: _so [,_ you know _,] _they're_ not_ , you're _not_ worried _about_ _them_ running all-around _the_ neighborhood [and [,] you know _,] they [,_ you know _,] they , they_ make their mess _in _the_ cat_ _pan_ which _is ,_ 
B|18| M: [Yeah .] 
A|19| A: _yeah [,_ it's [,] you know [,] it's] [a] pain _to_ clean _but [,_ you know , we] _used to_ [, I] mean _, they_ _got_ great stuff [out] _now_ _for_ cleaning cats' pans . They didn't , 
B|20| M: _No _,_ I [,_ I'm not] sure _if_ [I] would consider [that] [a] hobby . 
A|21| A: [Well ,] when _I _was_ [,_ you know ,] when _I was_ growing _up_ [I] _had a_ clean _the cat_ _pan_ _all the_ time [, and I] hated [it] _because_ [I] _had to_ carry everything upstairs [and [,] you know [,] and] use this _thing_ _to_ [, you know ,] scoop _the ,_ take _the_ stuff [out and] _put_ [it] _in the_ toilet [and] everything _it was_ [really] terrible . _But_ _now_ _they have_ _like_ this [, you] _get_ _these_ liners _, that is_ garbage bags [, you know ,] 
B|22| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|23| A: [and] _you [,_ and] _you [, you_ know] _the ,_ 
B|24| M: _And_ [the [,] _and] the_ _people [,_ and] [it's _just] [,_ _it] [,_ you don't] _even_ _know what_ _it is [,_ you] _just [,_ you] [have to] [wonder] _if_ [it's] some sort _of_ [, uh ,] some sort , uh-hive [, uh] [uh [,] uh] [you know] [for] , [for] [, uh] 
A|25| A: _Yeah _,_ the_ _cats_ _do_ [it] _in_ _there [,_ you] pull [it] [and] take [it] [out and] throw [it] away [, and] _that's_ [it ,] 
B|26| M: _I've_ [got] [a ,] _I've_ [got] two [cats] [now] [, _and] _they're_ both_ [about] [the same] age . 
A|27| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: [and] _we _had_ a _,_ a cat_ [, um ,] _who_ [was [,] uh ,] [about] eight _years_ old [, _and] she_ would sleep [in the] back _of_ [the] [house] _with_ us , 
A|29| A: Same idea 
B|30| M: _Uh [,_ _and] it [was_ [a] lot] _of_ _fun _,_ but [I_ was] also trying [to] figure _out [,_ you know ,] _how_ [to] [get] rid _of_ _the , [the_ [,] uh ,] sticky buns [, and [,] _and] [the_ [,] and] [all the] little things [that] [, that] [we] [have to] peel _for [the_ ,] [to] open [the] _can_ . 
A|31| A: Everyday ? 
B|32| M: _and _it was_ [,_ it [was] a] very dirty [pan] , 
A|33| A: _Oh , okay_ [, I] see . 
B|34| M: _And_ [so _, I] guess_ _I _, I_ think_ [that's] [the] only [thing] [I] _can_ [really] complain [about] [about] [is [,] uh [,] the] service charge _. _I_ don't know_ _if_ [it's just] [a] part _of_ _it , [but_ [,] uh] 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [and it] would [have] killed [the cat] _, but it was_ [so] worth [it .] 
A|37| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|38| M: _So _,_ she's_ _, she_ [has a] [real] fear [about] cucumbers , cucumbers [because] _she_ says [that] _they're just_ too hard _, she_ doesn't want [to] eat [them .] 
A|39| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|40| M: _And_ [so] _she_ [has] [put] [in] [a lot] _of_ _work [and_ [,] and] he's _been_ _an_ excellent [dog .] 
A|41| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|42| M: _So ,_ 
A|43| A: [So _,] you don't have_ anything _right now_ ? 
B|44| M: _No _,_ not_ [right now] . 
A|45| A: [Oh ,] except [the] kid , huh _, that's ,_ 
B|46| M: [Yeah _,] so ._ 
A|47| A: [Uh [,] I don't] [, I don't know] [because] [the] [cats] _pretty_ _much_ [, um [,] _yeah] [,_ we] [can] leave [them] [for] [a] weekend _as_ _long_ _as_ [we] [put] plenty [of] food [out ,] 
B|48| M: _Oh ._ 
A|49| A: [and [,] um [,] uh [,] it's] [not] [a] _big_ deal [really] [, I] mean _they're , they're_ happier when we're _around_ [but [,] you know _,] they _,_ they're_ _pretty_ _much_ _okay_ by themselves [, um [,] and [I] don't] [, you know , _we] couldn't_ _do that_ [with] [a [dog] .] 
B|50| M: [Yeah .] 
A|51| A: [Well _,] that's ,_ That's [, um ,] pampering [the , the] petals 
B|52| M: [Uh [,] yeah] . 
A|53| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and] then [, [you] , you] [had _to] go_ [out and] mow [the] grass , 
A|55| A: _But_ _they're not_ [that] _much_ [fun [,] you know _,] you can't_ take [them] [for] [a] walk _, you can't_ [, you know _,] they , they_ [don't] _, they_ _can't_ fetch [, you know ,] 
B|56| M: [Yeah .] 
A|57| A: _they_ _they_ _can't do_ anything [, so] [I've] never [, I think] [we had] fish when [I [was] a] kid [but [I] don't] , 
B|58| M: [Oh ,] [I've] heard _of [them_ .] 
A|59| A: [Oh .] 
B|60| M: _and [it was_ like [,] it was] [about] eleven _or_ twelve feet [long] [, and] [he] jumped [out and] jumped [right] _into_ [it .] 
A|61| A: [Oh .] 
B|62| M: _And_ [it [was] [a] [,] _it was] [,_ [it] [,] it] looked [like] _it was the same_ color [as] [the] _one_ [that] [my] mother made . 
A|63| A: [Oh .] 
B|64| M: [But] [, um] . 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [so] [we] [just] took our [dog] [in] [and] [he] [was] _just [,_ it was] [just] too [much] . 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: _And_ [we [had] to] [get] rid [of] [all] [of] [the] barns [that] [were] [there [,] _and] the_ barn [was] empty [, and] [we couldn't] [get] [out] _there and_ [we were] trying [to] [get] [out] [the , [the] [,] uh [,] the] drag net [out and] [we] tried [to] [get] back [out _and] [the_ [,] and] then [we] couldn tinker [with] [that] [and] [we] ended [up] [having] [to] [get] [all the] drag [out] [of] [the] dragnet [, and] [that] [was [,] that] [was [a] [,] that's] [a] part [of] [the] problem [, you know , [we] had] [all the] barn space [in the] [house] [, but [we] had] no room [for] dragNET . 
A|69| A: [No , it's] [like [,] I] [just [,] I don't know , I , I] [just] never understood why _, what_ [the] attraction [, I] mean _, _they're_ [,_ you know _,] they're_ _pretty_ [and] everything [but] [I've] [just] never seen [the] attraction [of] [having] fish . It's [not] [as] [much] [fun] . 
B|70| M: [Well [,] they , [they] [have] to] [be [,] they] [just] [have to] [get] [used to] each _other_ _, I guess_ . 
A|71| A: [an] eel ? 
B|72| M: [an] elk . 
A|73| A: [Oh _,] now_ [we] [really] [get] sick 
B|74| M: [Yeah [,] but] [they're not] too _bad_ . 
A|75| A: [Yeah .] 
B|76| M: [But] [, uh ,] we've [had] some [pretty] [nice] weather down [there] . 
A|77| A: Like [, I] _remember_ [a friend] [of] mine at [work] telling me [that] at his frat [in] college [that] [they] [had a] tank [of] piranha [, [and _,] uh [,] you_ know ,] [used to] drop mice [in] 
B|78| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: this [is] [not] , _these_ aren't [cats] [, you know ,] 
B|80| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|81| A: this [is] gross . 
B|82| M: [I] _know ._ 
A|83| A: Yep . 
B|84| M: [I don't _know] ._ 
A|85| A: _Yeah , well ,_ 
B|86| M: [But] [, uh [, I] don't know [, I] think] [, uh] . 
A|87| A: _Yeah , well [,_ a cat] will _do_ [the same] trick 
B|88| M: [Yeah .] 
A|89| A: [I] [had [a] friend] [in] [I] [had [a] friend] [in] college [who] [had a [,] um ,] [had a] _pet_ rat [for] [a] while . 
B|90| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|91| A: Um [, I] forget [how] [she] [got] [it [, but] [it was] [,] um [,] [it was] the same] kind [of] [a] deal [I think] [she] [got] [it [,] I think] _she was a_ psych major [and she] [got] [it] from [the] psych department . 
B|92| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|93| A: Whoops 
B|94| M: [so] [I] don [know [,] [but] _,] I guess_ _I , I [,_ my] [pet] peeve [with] magazines [is [,] I] find [them] [to] [be] very formula oriented [, and [I] think] [that's] _one of_ [the] reasons [that] they've gone downhill _the last_ _few years [,_ but] [they're , they're] [still] [around ,] 
A|95| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [and I] said [, well [,] you [can't] [do] that] [, I'm] sorry . 
A|97| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [but [,] um] . 
A|99| A: [Uh-huh .] [Oh [,] _yeah] [,_ I] mean [, you know ,] [if] [you] [get] [them] young [and] everything before [they] [go] , kind [of] nuts [, so .] 
B|100| M: [Well [,] I [, I] think] [, I'm not] sure [how] [much] [of] [that [is] [,] uh , [you] , you] [have to] [do] [with] [the , the] social changes [that] [have] occurred [, uh] . 
A|101| A: [Yeah ,] rats _are_ [not] [my] favorite animals [in the] world [, but I] could see getting [one] from birth [and] everything . 
B|102| M: [Well [,] we [,] we] [have] [a dog] [now] [and] [we [,] uh [,] we] found _her_ [about] [a] year [ago [and ,] uh] [we] took _her_ home [and she] [had] picked [up] [a] ham _and [it was_ the] strangest [thing] _, [she_ was a] hamster . 
A|103| A: [Yeah .] 
B|104| M: [and ,] 
A|105| A: [Yeah [,] [I [, I] ,] I have] friends [with] hamsters [and] gerbils [and] [they , they] tell me [the same] [thing] . 
B|106| M: [Well [,] they ,] 
A|107| A: [I] [just ,] again [it] gets [into] vivant [much] [fun [,] you [know] _what] [,_ I guess] [they] [can] [be] _. I ,_ 
B|108| M: [I] _know ._ 
A|109| A: Okay . 
B|110| M: _And_ [, um] . 
A|111| A: Right . 
B|112| M: [but it's] very [much] possible [to] [have] [one] without [a lot] [of] , [of] [these] [, you don't have to] [be] [a] certain income holder [to] [have] pets . 
A|113| A: [Oh] [people ,] 
B|114| M: [yeah ,] [people] [have] pets [now] . 
A|115| A: [I don't] , oh , plus [, I] mean [, the] pooper scooper [one] _New York_ _, so [,_ you [know] .] 
B|116| M: [Yeah , well [,] that's [,] that] [, that _is] a_ good point [. I [,] I'm not] sure [how] , [how] [the] [New York] system fits [into] [it [, but] I] [know] [that] [the , [the] [,] uh [,] the] [New] _Jersey_ school system [, uh] 
A|117| A: [Yeah [,] uh , [I] was] living [in] northern [Jersey] when [that] law came through , _remember_ hearing [all] [about] [it ,] 
B|118| M: [Yeah .] 
A|119| A: [we were] wondering [if] [they [,] uh [,] they] [had] any special law [for the] horses [in] Central Park . 
B|120| M: [Oh .] 
A|121| A: Of course [, not] . 
B|122| M: [No] . 
A|123| A: Hit [the] bags . 
B|124| M: _but [they_ ,] they've [got] [these] little [, you know ,] [like] two little , two little shines [, and] [one] [big] frying [pan] . 
A|125| A: [Oh ,] God [, I] [can't] , Haven't [been] [up] [there ,] [last] time [I was] [there] [was] _fall_ [so] probably wasn't [that] [bad] 
B|126| M: [Oh .] 
A|127| A: Not this past _fall_ [but I] mean _fall_ [, a] [few years [,] I] mean [, it] [it was] [in [the] [,] [yeah] [,] it was] almost [like] October [of] eighty-five , 
B|128| M: [Oh .] 
A|129| A: [I think] [was [the] last] time [I was] [up] , [up] [there and] at Center Park . 
B|130| M: [Uh [,] that] sounds [like] [a] good plan . 
A|131| A: Um [, I] [had [a] friend who] [went] [to] Colombia [and I] [used [to] go] [up] [and] visit [her] . 
B|132| M: [Oh [,] that's] where [I] live , too . 
A|133| A: Um _, so ,_ 
B|134| M: [Well [,] I think] [, I [,] I'm] thinking [about] going [to] Europe [in the] [fall] . 
A|135| A: [No [,] [they're] just] mutts , 
B|136| M: [Oh , okay] . 
A|137| A: [yeah [,] my] wife [got] [them] from [, uh [,] um ,] [friend] [of] hers at [work and] everything [, you know [,] you know ,] [as] kittens , 
B|138| M: [Oh .] 
A|139| A: [and it was] before [, I] mean , this [was] before [we] [even] met . Um [, she's] [had] [them] [for] [a] couple [years] . [And] [um [,] you know [,] they're] [really] cute [, [they're] , they're] sisters , 
B|140| M: [Oh .] 
A|141| A: [one [of] them] [is [a] lot] bigger than [the] [other] [one] [and [,] she] pushes [the] [other] [one] away from [the] food . Apparently [I don't know] [all the] details [but _they] were_ born [around] Christmas [because] [one [of] them] [is] named Tinsel [and the] [other] [one] [is] named Holly . 
B|142| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|143| A: You [know [,] the] 
B|144| M: [Uh [,] now] [I] don [, I] don t [remember] [what] [they [were] [,] what] [they] look [like] . 
A|145| A: [both] [, [yeah] ,] [both] females [, [they're] both] spayed [, um ,] [or] whatever [it is ,] neutered [, you know [,] um ,] 
B|146| M: [Uh [,] so [,] uh [,] what] [do] [you] [think] [about] [, uh] [what] [do] [, what] [about] [the [,] [what] [,] what] [are] [the] opinions [on] capital punishment ? 
A|147| A: [and [they're] , [they're] both] declawed at least [on] [the , the] front claws . 
B|148| M: [Oh ,] [really] ?
