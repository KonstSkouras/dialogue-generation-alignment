A|3| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|4| M: _but_ _the_ women _don't_ . 
A|5| A: _You know _, I_ , I_ _really_ _agree with you ._ Um _, I _,_ uh ,_ though I've never done _that_ myself _, I _,_ I'm ,_ _was a_ basically _an_ education major when [I] graduated _from_ college [and I] accepted _a_ job _that_ _at_ [the] time _was_ _just_ slightly above [the] poverty level _to_ teach _to [,_ um] , _very_ rural _children_ _in_ _a very_ low income district [and I] spent _a_ year teaching _there_ 
B|6| M: _Uh ,_ uh-hue . 
A|7| A: [and I think] _it_ _was_ probably _one_ _of_ my largest eye-opening experiences [because] [I] come _from_ _nice_ middle class white suburban home 
B|8| M: _Uh ,_ uh-hue . 
A|9| A: _and I did_ _it [,_ um] , for _one_ reason [I] wanted _, I_ _was_ working _on_ _a_ masters degree _so I_ wanted _to_ stay close _to_ _where_ [I] _was_ working _on_ _a_ masters degree _, but_ also [because] _I just_ thought _that_ _it would be_ interesting _to_ live some place else _so_ totally different than my own up bringing 
B|10| M: _Uh_ . 
A|11| A: _and I _,_ it_ changed _, it_ probably changed my political views _it_ changed my understanding _of _the_ world_ _around_ me 
B|12| M: _Uh ,_ uh-hue 
A|13| A: [and _I think] [,_ um] , _in_ fact , _if_ [I] had _to_ _do_ _it_ _all_ again _I [, you_ know ,] after _that , you know [,_ you] never [think] _of it_ [because] _, I guess_ [because] [I] paid for _all_ _of_ my college education myself _, I_ never thought _about_ doing _that_ [because] [I] had _all_ these college loans I'd started paying back . 
B|14| M: _Uh _,_ yeah_ . 
A|15| A: Um , _so_ _that was_ _, that was_ _one_ reason why [I] never considered _it_ [but] _now_ _that_ _I'm_ further _along_ _, and_ _I'm_ still paying these college loans _, I _, I_ think_ realistically [, you know [,] you] can _have_ _your_ college loans delayed _now_ _, because_ [I] had _them_ delayed [because] _I'm_ back _in_ graduate _school_ _at_ thirty years old , 
B|16| M: Huh-uh . _Oh _,_ _that's_ [,_ that] _is_ [, that] [would be] , that'd _be an_ ideal _situation_ . 
A|17| A: [um] _, I_ had _them_ delayed [because] _I'm_ back _in_ graduate _school_ [and] _on_ [that] form _it_ says _if_ _your_ joining [the] Peace Corps [you] can _have_ _them_ delayed 
B|18| M: _Oh ,_ [really] ? 
A|19| A: [and I] thought _that was_ [, you know ,] _very_ interesting _and _I ,_ I_ [would] _have_ thought _of_ [that] earlier [I] probably [would] _have_ done [, you know ,] _just_ _like_ _, is that _,_ is_ this _, is that_ [the] Mormon church [, that] does [that] ? 
B|20| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|21| A: Because _one_ _of_ my neighbors _, uh ,_ _did_ [that] _in_ Pittsburgh _, from_ Pittsburgh . 
B|22| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|23| A: And [I] thought [, you know [,] that] [really] , _now_ [that] _I'm_ thirty years old _, _I think_ that_ _one_ _or_ two years out _of_ my life [would] _have ,_ probably _like_ [you] said , _to be_ able _to_ travel some place else whether _it_ _be the_ United States _or_ outside [the] country _, I think_ _it would_ _have_ been _a very good_ [, um] , experience for me . 
B|24| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|25| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: [and] _it's_ kind _, it's_ [, [it] [,] _it] _is_ a_ [, [it] would be] kind [of] selfish [, but] _it's _a_ good_ thing . 
A|27| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: _and , um_ . 
A|29| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] And _I think [,_ you know ,] _we have_ such [a] need _now_ [, you _know ,] I_ taught [, you _know _,] I_ _, I_ think_ [I] _was_ paid _, uh ,_ _about_ nine thousand dollars _to_ teach for [the] year 
B|30| M: _Uh_ . 
A|31| A: [and I] worked _in_ _a very_ rural _school_ district _and _I _,_ I_ ,_ _one_ _of the_ things [I] taught _was a_ computer class 
B|32| M: _Uh_ . 
A|33| A: [and] these kids [, um] [, you know ,] every girl [I] taught , except for _one_ , _was_ pregnant . 
B|34| M: _Uh_ . 
A|35| A: Many _of the_ boys _in the_ room had _children_ [and] _they_ were , _they_ were high _school_ juniors . 
B|36| M: _Uh_ . 
A|37| A: And _I just_ , _there_ [, you know ,] _they_ came _from_ poverty , _they_ were _going to_ condition _in_ poverty [and] [it] _was_ [, it] _was_ _, _the_ school_ district couldn't hire _many_ _people_ [, it] _was_ _very_ difficult for _them_ _to_ hire _, and _I think_ [,_ you know ,] _in the_ sense [, that] aspect [of] public service for education _in_ some _of the_ inner cities for [, um] , _just_ social workers _in_ some _of the_ inner cities [and] some _of the_ rural areas _where_ _they_ _just_ need advice _on_ medical [, um] , things _, I think_ [it's a] [really] [good] idea . And even _if_ [it is] overseas . 
B|38| M: _Well [,_ I'm] not sure [if] [it's] [the] teachers themselves [that] _are the_ problem [, but] [I think] [the school] districts . 
A|39| A: See _, I_ never _, I , I_ tell [you] sometimes [I] worry _about_ things over seas [because] _we have_ such problems _right_ here _in_ our own country . 
B|40| M: _Well ,_ you're [right] , we're [a] _long_ way away [from] [that] . 
A|41| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|42| M: [I , I] _don't_ [know [, _I] guess] [,_ uh [,] [I] just] _don't_ see _the _, the_ [,_ uh] _the , I_ mean [, I'm] not sure [, I] see [a] _great_ deal [of] [, uh] [uh ,] improvement [from] [, from] [the] way [we have] [it] [now] . 
A|43| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|44| M: [I] mean _, it's_ [, [it] is] [, you] [, you] either want [to] serve [the] community [or] [you] want [to [be] [the] world] leader , which [is] [the] same thing . 
A|45| A: _Right ._ [Uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: _Uh , you_ _don't_ see _too_ _many [,_ uh ,] _young_ , _young_ men running [around] [with] guns [and] shooting [people] [or] anything [like] [that] . 
A|47| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|48| M: _and , uh ,_ 
A|49| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|50| M: [I think that] _is a_ big part [of [it] ,] _too_ . 
A|51| A: [Yeah .] [I think] [it would] also _help them_ [if] _they_ then _went_ _on_ [to] college . _I know_ [that] my first couple [of] years [of] college were [, um] [, uh ,] probably [too] carefree _at_ [the ,] beginning 
B|52| M: _Uh_ . 
A|53| A: [and] then _at_ [the] end [I] had [to be] [too] serious . 
B|54| M: _Uh [,_ [I] know] . 
A|55| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|56| M: [they] [have] [to be] [there] [at] [all] times . 
A|57| A: _Yeah [,_ that's] true . 
B|58| M: [but] [I think that] [that's] part [of the] problem . 
A|59| A: [Uh-huh] [, that's] _right ._ 
B|60| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|61| A: [I [,] yeah] _, I think _, I_ think_ this _was_ , this _was _a_ very_ interesting topic [uh _,] because it's_ something _that , you know ,_ [we] [don't] _talk about_ _in_ this country probably enough . 
B|62| M: _Uh ,_ well [, I , I] [have] _a lot of_ friends [that] [have [,] uh ,] [children] [that] [have] [children] [, [and [I] ,] you] [, you] can't blame [your] parents . 
A|63| A: [Uh [, you] know ,] 
B|64| M: [Yeah ,] well [, I guess] _that's [,_ that [was] _a] good_ [one] [to] put [on] [the] list . 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|66| M: _and , um_ . 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [but] [it's] _, [it's_ _a] lot_ more expensive [, and _I think] that's_ part [of it] [too] [, is that [,] um] [you know] _the , the_ quality [of the] food [is] [really] not _as_ important [, because it's] not [, you] can't [just] _make_ [a] meal [now] [and] expect [to [,] you] , you're [going to] [have] [a very good] meal . 
A|69| A: [Oh _,] I think_ [it is] . 
B|70| M: So . 
A|71| A: [I] [really] _think _, I_ think [,_ um] , [people] [, you] should [, [I _,] you] know , the_ kids today [I] teach [, I] spend [a lot of] my time teaching college students 
B|72| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hum . 
A|73| A: [and , um] [, I] find [great] disgust _in_ _them_ , _in_ their , _in_ their [, um] , their self-centeredness [and] their inability [to] understand [, um] , multicultural [or] multiracial [situation] 
B|74| M: [Uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|75| A: [and I] [really] [, you know ,] [they] [don't] understand [, uh ,] how other [people] live [, um] , [they] [don't] understand , 
B|76| M: [Uh] . 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah _,] [I think_ [that's] [,] uh ,] [just] having [a good] time . 
B|78| M: [Yeah .] 
A|79| A: [I [,] uh _,] a_ friend [of] mine [is a] psychologist [and] he always refers [to] [it] [as] short-term pleasure oriented . [I guess] he's [a] technical aspect he likes [to] apply [to] [it [,] you know ,] 
B|80| M: [Uh] . 
A|81| A: today's [young] [people] [are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|82| M: [Right .] 
A|83| A: [and] everything _has [to_ [be] an] immediate reward [and] [it] _has [to_ be] fun . 
B|84| M: [Uh [,] yeah] . 
A|85| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|86| M: _Well _,_ it's_ [nice] talking [to] [you .] 
A|87| A: [Well ,] [they] say _, I think_ [I [,] um] , [have] read recently [that [,] uh [,] the] Bush Administration _has_ increased [the] funding for [the] Peace Corps . 
B|88| M: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
A|89| A: [Uh-huh .] Because [I guess] [because] [of the] changes _in_ Eastern Europe [, uh ,] they've increased funding for [the] Peace Corps . Some [of [the] [, I] guess] [it's] some [of the] peace dividend _in the_ sense [, you] known , 
B|90| M: [Uh] . 
A|91| A: when [they're] decreasing some [of the] military spending , some [of] [that] money _has_ gone into [the] Peace Corps 
B|92| M: [Uh] . 
A|93| A: [and] some [of the] [are the] overseas programs . [Uh ,] 
B|94| M: [I] see . 
A|95| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [so I] [went] [and I did] what [I] could [to] [help them] [along] [the] way , 
A|97| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|98| M: But [I think that's] [really] [a] [, a] big part [of it] . 
A|99| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|100| M: So [, uh [,] I , I] [don't] [know [, I] think , I] mean [, I] [do] [like] _the _, the_ [,_ uh] [the school] systems [in the] city _and , uh_ 
A|101| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [very] true . _You know ,_ how [many [,] is] [it] [they] say [we have] [so] [many] _lawyers_ [in] this country [, and [I] guess [,] I , I] live near Washington , being [in] , [in] Baltimore [, it's] something [like] [one] [in] four [people] , [in the] Washington , area , [are] _lawyers_ , 
B|102| M: [Uh ,] 
A|103| A: And [, and [I] just] sort [of] [think that's] ridiculous . 
B|104| M: _That's_ [right .] 
A|105| A: [Yeah ,] [with] [with] [the] [great] needs [that] [we] need today [in] science [and] biology [and , uh _,] you know , the , the_ problems [we have] [with] AIDS [and] cancer [and [,] and] how come everybody [is a] lawyer [, you know [,] you know] 
B|106| M: [Uh [,] I'm [,] I] am [, I] [agree with you .] 
A|107| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|108| M: [You know [, I] think , I] [don't] [know ,] there's [too] [many] cases [where] [, uh] [you know] [it's] not [the] person's fault [that] [has to] pay [the] full price . 
A|109| A: [Uh-huh .] _Yeah , you_ saw , statistics [that] _lawyers_ [and] _doctors_ [make] [the] most money [in the] [long] run . 
B|110| M: [Right .] 
A|111| A: [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
B|112| M: [I] mean [, it's] [just] [that [, you know ,] the , the] [lawyers] [are the] ones [that] [are] making [the] decisions [and] [the] [doctors] , 
A|113| A: [That's] interesting . [Uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: So [, uh [,] I guess] we're supposed [to] [talk about] family reunions . 
A|115| A: Okay . Hey , thanks [so] much for [the] conversation . 
B|116| M: [Yeah , you] [too] . 
A|117| A: [Well ,] thank [you] [very] much . _Bye-bye_ .
