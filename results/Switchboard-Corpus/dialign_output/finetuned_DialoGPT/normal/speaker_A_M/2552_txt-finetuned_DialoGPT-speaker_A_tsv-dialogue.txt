B|2| M: _Right , _right_ ._ 
A|3| A: _And so_ _I think _,_ um _,_ it's_ become real _important_ _to_ _me_ _that_ _we_ try _to_ spend _time_ together _as_ _a_ family . _So_ there's _one_ or _two_ nights _a_ week , _we_ _have_ _a ,_ _on_ Monday nights _we_ set aside _time_ where _it's_ called _, uh ,_ family home evening _and we_ stay home _that_ evening , all _of_ us _, and we_ _do_ things together .

B|12| M: _Right ._ 
A|13| A: [Right _,] _and_ then_ _, you know ,_ sometimes _we_ try _to_ _do_ our lesson _on_ Sunday night _and then_ our activity or something _on_ Monday _but_ , We're _, it's_ real _important_ _to_ us _to_ spend _time_ together . 
B|14| M: _That's _right_ ._

A|21| A: They are _a_ handful . 
B|22| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|23| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|24| M: [And] [, uh] 
A|25| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|26| M: [So] [, uh] [you know ,]

B|36| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] 
A|37| A: _Well _,_ it's_ also _important _,_ I think _,_ um ,_ _for_ [my] husband . _I , I_ try _to go out_ [of] [my] way _to ,_ _to_ plan things _that_ he _can_ _do_ _with_ _the_ kids _because_ , since [I am] home _with_ [them] _and so_ [I] _get_ _a_ lot [of] _time_ _with_ [them] , he needs _to_ _have_ _, um ,_ _some_ _time_ _with_ [them .]

B|40| M: Uh . 
A|41| A: [and] he reads _to_ [them] , 
B|42| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|43| A: [and] he spends _about_ an hour doing _that , and_ _that's_ _, that's_ pretty _good_ quality _time_ , _with_ [them] , 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! ; !! RemindMe !! remindMe ! % 
A|45| A: _and _,_ um _,_ but_ _it's_ hard _for_ him _on_ Saturdays . He , he wants , [Right ,] he wants _to_ run _out and_ _get_ things done , 
B|46| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|47| A: _and _so_ _,_ um [,_ I] try _to_ say [, well ,] why _don't_ [you] _go_ fly kites or why _don't_ _you do_ something . 
B|48| M: [Oh [,] that] _is [,_ that] [would] [be] [good] , 
A|49| A: [And] if _I have_ something _in_ mind , _then_ he , he remembers _that _,_ that's_ _what_ he wants _to_ _do_ . 
B|50| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|51| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|52| M: _You_ [know [,] and] [I think] [that's] [important _,] because_ [you] [can] tell [when] they're [, when] [they] [get] older [, you] [can] _see_ how _much_ they've lost . 
A|53| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [And] [they] _had_ [a] nice big roast _, it_ [was like] roast beef [, you] could feed _it_ [for] [two] adults [and then] roast [the] potatoes [and then] [you] _had_ [, uh _,] _like_ a_ big roast beef sack full [of] fresh berries [and then] put [on] aitas [and] onions [and then] [a] little bit [of] Amaretta [and] [some] crayon wine [and then] [just] cover _it_ [with] foil [and] put _it_ [in the] microwave [for] [just] [a] minute [to] cool _it_ up . 
A|55| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|56| M: [and they] _had_ _, they_ _had_ this little light [that they] put [on] [the] outside [of] [the] car [so] [they] could [, you] could _see_ [what] [the] _, the_ emissions were . 
A|57| A: [Yes] . 
B|58| M: [so] [we] left [and then we] [came] _back_ _and it_ [was] dark [, and we] were gone [so] _long_ . 
A|59| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|60| M: [but] [we] [didn't] [know] [that] . 
A|61| A: _Well _,_ that's_ [right .] [But] [I] _do_ _think _,_ um _,_ you know [,_ like] [the] current trends are _that _,_ um [,_ the] family unit [is] devaluated . It's _not_ nearly _as_ [important] . 
B|62| M: Uh [, I think] [that's] probably _true ._ 
A|63| A: We _find_ _that _,_ you know ,_ [back] [just] even fifty years ago [when] _people_ [had] financial problems [, the] first _place_ [they] went [to] [was] their family . 
B|64| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh , uh-uh 
A|65| A: [And] families took _care_ [of] themselves _and _,_ um _,_ but_ now _, you know ,_ _people_ _don't_ [, they] _don't_ support each other [that] way . 
B|66| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [and [,] uh _,] _it_ , it_ [just] [, you] [, you] [don't] [have] [that] anymore _. You_ [have] [to] work [for] _it_ . 
A|69| A: [That's right] [and ,] 
B|70| M: [and so] [it's _,] it_ really [is] [a] waste [of] someone's [time .] 
A|71| A: [Right , right] , 
B|72| M: [And] [they] don tinker [with] [that [, and] [,] you know [,] they] don [, they] aren't [, you] [don't] _see_ [the] mistakes [in] every work [place] , 
A|73| A: [And] [it's] _not_ an easy sacrifice [for] [a] _person_ _to make_ [, because] _, you know _, I_ _,_ you know , I have_ interests [that ,] _too_ , 
B|74| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [and _it] is_ hard _to make_ [, uh ,] those interests _not_ [be] _as_ [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|76| M: _Right ._ 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: [But , uh] . 
A|79| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|80| M: [And] I'm [like] , I'm [not] [that] old [, but] [I] [just] [, I] [just] can't seem [to] stick [with] [it] . 
A|81| A: [Right .] 
B|82| M: [And [so] _,] it_ [was] [a] little different . 
A|83| A: It [is] temporary . It , [in the] middle [of] [it , it] seems [like a] [long] [time] , 
B|84| M: Uh-uh _. _Yeah_ ._ 
A|85| A: [but] _you're right_ [, _it] is_ temporary . _Well , I_ [see] [that] [we] both share [the] same belief here [that] [it's] [important] [that] [we] spend [time] [with] our kids 
B|86| M: Uh [, that's] _true ._ 
A|87| A: [and [,] and ,] [in] spite [of] , 
B|88| M: [Well [, [I] [,] I] think] [that [,] uh [,] you know [,] [that] [,] that] [the] [, uh] ... 
A|89| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|90| M: [And] [, uh ,] I'm sure , [you're] [not] alone there . 
A|91| A: [Yes] . 
B|92| M: [So] [, [I [,] I] think [,] you] [see] [, you] [don't] [see] [too] many single mothers having children _. You_ [see] more single mothers [, um ,] having children [, [you] do] [see] more [, um] 
A|93| A: [That's] [true .] 
B|94| M: _You_ [know , I] mean [, I ,] _I've_ [had] [people] [, uh ,] let's [see] [, I] [had] [a] friend who [was] [a] teacher [and] she [said] [that [,] uh] ... 
A|95| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [So] [, it] really _is ,_ [you're [right] .] 
A|97| A: [Yeah .] 
B|98| M: [and] she [just] , she [just] really doesn't [care] [about] [the] child either . She's [just] [, you] [, you] [just] [have] [to] accept [that] [as] [it is] . 
A|99| A: [Well [,] [it] [is] [,] the] hardest thing [I've] ever done , [as] [much] [as] you'd _go out_ 
B|100| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh , uh-uh 
A|101| A: [and ,] 
B|102| M: [I] [just] [, I] [was] [just] thinking [, I] [just] [, you know , I have] [to [,] you] [just] [have] [to] [find] [a] [place] [, you] [have] [to make] [it [,] you] [don't] [have] [to go [out] and] buy [it ,] 
A|103| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|107| A: [Well [,] that's] [good] . 
B|108| M: [and [,] uh [, it's] just] [, you know ,] she's such [a] wonderful [person] [, and] [I , I] [just] [, I] really , I'm [just] pulling [for] her . 
A|109| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|110| M: [so] [that's] really [, uh] . 
A|111| A: No [. Yeah] [, I think] [so] . [I think] [it's] an investment [in] your future , even if [it's] purely [not] , [not] religious [. You] [can] at least say [that] [it's] [important] [to] our country [, that] our family unit stays strong . 
B|112| M: Uh [, well [,] I] [know] [my] wife's mother [in] law [is] [a ,] [a [,] uh] [a] practicing vegetarian .
