B|2| M: Uh-huh . 
A|3| A: _Well , _I_ think_ _it's_ interesting _to_ look at _, uh ,_ where _the_ money goes , _and_ _it_ goes _a_ lot of places where _it_ probably ought _not_ go _and_ _and_ _I_ _don't_ _think_ generally _, _I_ think_ what's interesting _is that_ we probably represent _the_ majority of people in this country in terms of _their_ feelings _about the_ government 
B|4| M: Uh-huh . 
A|5| A: _and_ how _it_ serves us given _the_ extraordinarily large sum of money _the_ government has _to_ operate _with_ . 
B|6| M: Uh-huh . 
A|7| A: _And_ _that _,_ what_ _I think_ _is_ going _to_ be really interesting _is_ _what_ we _do_ _about_ _it_ _. I_ mean , we are going _to_ _have to_ change _the_ people who represent us . 
B|8| M: _Right ._ 
A|9| A: _I_ mean , _and_ _I think_ _it's_ going _to_ be real interesting _to_ see _and_ , _and_ then force upon them _, uh ,_ 
B|10| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|11| A: [Yeah] , right _that's_ _I think_ _that's_ _the_ only _thing_ _that's_ going _to_ change _it_ . 
B|12| M: [And] [I think] [the] [, uh] 
A|13| A: Our anger _is_ going _to_ _have to ,_ _to_ give rise _to ,_ _to_ more activity on our part . 
B|14| M: [I think] [that [,] uh] . 
A|15| A: Uh , I've , I've said for years [that] there's full employment for [the] politically active _and_ in our society _, uh ,_ there's very little full employment . Most people in this country are getting worse off , _not_ better off . 
B|16| M: Oh , yeah . 
A|17| A: Eighty percent of _the public_ , according _to_ Bill Moyers' _, uh ,_ recent _, uh ,_ piece for _, uh ,_ Public Broadcasting , which , _by the_ way _is a_ very good use of government money _. I think_ P B S _is_ wonderful . But this special focused on [the] fact [that] eighty percent of [the] people in this country are , are seeing _their_ real incomes , _and_ thus , standards of living , decline . [And] twenty percent are seeing theirs improve . That's _not_ _a formula_ for _a_ better society . 
B|18| M: No , no . It's [not] . It _, it's ,_ _it [is_ [a] formula] [that's] _, that's_ being _used_ [by] politicians _and by_ industry _and [by_ [the] public] [to] [their] advantage . 
A|19| A: [And] [the] government really plays [a] role in this . 
B|20| M: Uh-huh . 
A|21| A: [I] mean , well , they are [the] people whose strings are pulled [and by] [I] guess powerful 
B|22| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|23| A: You _know_ , [and] [it's] really interesting [to] see how [that] affects people because essentially more [and] more people in this country are [not] likely [to] revolt in [the] way [that] people [used] [to] [think] of , of [the] voter revolting . But people are pretty much getting [the] picture [that] some people get taken care of [and] others _don't_ [and] they [think] [it's] unfair , [and] _when_ they recognize [that] [it's] [their] tax money , they're going [to] _do_ more _about_ [it] _. I_ I'll tell _you_ one quick _, uh ,_ one _thing_ very interesting . C B S , after [the] State of [the] Union address [is] going [to] open up [a] telephone line , an _eight hundred_ _number_ [and] people can _call_ in [and] say _what_ they _think about_ what's going on in this country . 
B|24| M: Oh [, I] [know] . 
A|25| A: They expect , opening [it] for one hour , [that] they'll get three , _hundred_ thousand telephone calls . 
B|26| M: Oh , goodness . 
A|27| A: [And] I've thought for years [it] would make [a] lot of sense [to] create an _eight hundred_ _number_ for voters [to] _call_ [and] , [and] vent [their] frustration _with_ government . Like one , _eight hundred_ capitol or something like [that] . You [know] , just [a] _number_ _you_ could _call_ from anywhere , anytime . 
B|28| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|29| A: [I think] [that's] coming [and] [I think] once , once people really start [to] communicate how they feel , things are going [to] change . Until then [, [I] think] _, you_ [know] [, it's] going [to] be really painful . So [the] question [is] , how soon are we going [to] start [to] get our money's worth [and] , as _you_ said [, it's] how soon we get involved , [and] [I think] we need [to] create mechanisms [to] allow us [to] get involved , like allowing us [to] _call_ [a] toll free _number_ [and] say , hey , look , _do_ [it] this way , [not] [that] way , or [I] like this , or [I] _don't_ like [that ,] or this [is] how [I] feel _about_ your spending my money on art [that] [I] _don't_ [think] [is] art . 
B|30| M: [Well , _I] [,_ I] agree [with] [you] [. I think] [the] [thing] [is [that] [,] uh ,] [when] [you] [call] [the] [eight hundred] dollar [number] [, you] [don't] [have to [,] uh] 
A|31| A: [Well [,] that's] [the] good [thing] _about_ _what_ [is] happening because [I think] more [and] more [the] news media , which takes [a] heck of [a] beating [and] , [and] deserves some of [it] , [is] telling us [, you] [know] , _about the_ problems . So [the] more we communicate , hey , look , we want [a] change here , because [, you] [know] , as [it] turns out , we've wasted [a] tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country . 
B|32| M: _Right ._ 
A|33| A: Over [a] very long period of time . 
B|34| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|35| A: Uh , [and] [, uh ,] 
B|36| M: [Well [,] what] [do] [you] [think [about] the] [, uh] ... 
A|37| A: [Right .] 
B|38| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] [Well [,] you] may be right . What [I think] [is] really going [to] be interesting [is] [to] see how [, uh ,] we as [a] society deal [with] [it] [and] [I ,] [and] [I think] [it is] [, what] [you] say [, it's [,] it's] [a] ,
