B|2| M: Right , [right] .

B|4| M: Uh-huh . 
A|5| A: _Well_ _, it's_ very true . 
B|6| M: _Uh [,_ [I] [,] you] [, you] [you know] [I think] [it's] [so] [, you] [don't] [have to] worry [about] [it] _too_ [much] _. Uh ,_ I've [, I] live [in] [a] small town [in] [a] town [in] Mesquite 
A|7| A: It's not the law abiding citizen _that_ [, [you] know] , is , is dangerous with the _gun_ It's the ones _that_ are going out _and_ stealing [it] . 
B|8| M: Right . 
A|9| A: [And] [I] said [I think] the only way [I] would be [in] big favor of _gun_ control is if they could absolutely guarantee _that_ nobody would [have] _them_ . [And] [I think] _that_ would almost [have _to] go_ with armies , [too] _. I_ mean , they'd [have to] be almost world-wide , which we [know] would never ever happen . 
B|10| M: Right . 
A|11| A: Because _even_ if [you] said , okay [, [you] know] , armed forces could [have] _them_ , some idiot would come out _and_ sell [it] [to] somebody on the street [to] make [a] quick buck . 
B|12| M: Right . 
A|13| A: That's very true very true . Who knows , we maybe want [to] overthrow the government 
B|14| M: [Yeah] . 
A|15| A: [I] [know] , if somebody doesn't do something [. Uh ,] what [about] [, uh] , what do [you] [think] of this , this [, uh] , law _that_ they're putting into effect _that_ [you] [have to] wait X number of days before [you] can [, uh] , carry the _gun_ , or buy [, [you] know] , actually purchase the _gun_ ? 
B|16| M: [Well] [that's] [a] good question [. [I] , [I] think] [it's [,] it's] [been a] while since I've [even] talked [to] [a] person [about] [that . [I] think] they've [just] [, uh] 
A|17| A: Yes . 
B|18| M: [And] [you] had [to] [have] [your] [gun] [in your] name . You had [to go] [to] [a gun] show [and] ask [them] [for] [a] driver's license .
