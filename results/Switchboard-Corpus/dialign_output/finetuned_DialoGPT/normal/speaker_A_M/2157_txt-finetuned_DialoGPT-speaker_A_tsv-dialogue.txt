B|0| M: _Oh , really_ ? 
A|1| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|2| M: _They_ _had a_ _pretty good_ _year ._ _Uh ,_ _they've_ _, they're_ _, _they_ were_ _a lot_ _better team_ _when_ Meacocca _was_ playing . 
A|3| A: _Yeah [,_ they're] _going to_ get [better] _. I_ mean _, _you_ know ._ 
B|4| M: _They're_ _not _going to_ be_ able [to] _last year _._ They're_ _not sure_ what's [going to] happen . 
A|5| A: _Yeah ._ As long as Troy Aikman doesn't get hurt again _. That_ kind _of_ killed them _at_ _the_ end _of the_ season [last year .] 
B|6| M: Uh-uh . That's _right_ [. That] _was a_ _big_ _one_ . 
A|7| A: _So _,_ I don't _, I_ don't_ even _know who_ _your_ favorite [team] is , actually . 
B|8| M: _Oh [,_ I] [know who] you're _talking_ _about_ [. _I] , I_ _like the_ Giants . 
A|9| A: Okay [. _I] think_ [I] did [know] _that_ _, I just_ forgot . Okay . 
B|10| M: _But , uh _,_ _yeah_ [,_ _I] , I_ _really_ _like the_ Giants . 
A|11| A: _Yeah ._ Has Herschel Walker done much _for_ them ? 
B|12| M: _Well ,_ _he's_ _doing real _good_ _,_ yeah ._ 
A|13| A: Definitely _. Well _,_ _he was_ a_ [good] player [. _I] guess_ , well _I don't know _,_ he_ _just_ _never_ _, I don't know ,_ _for a while_ _there_ , 
B|14| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|15| A: [Well _,] he_ could _always_ get past _, _you_ _know_ ,_ he'd get past [like] six or seven tackles _and_ _just_ keep spinning around _and_ get _on_ into [the] end zone . [But ,] um _, I guess_ _you_ _never_ could [really] _see_ _him_ play , because with _the Cowboys ,_ _while_ _he was_ with [the] [team] , [the] rest _of the_ [team] [was] [pretty] poor _so_ _you_ couldn't [really] tell if _it_ [was] _just_ _him_ or [the] [team] _and _I_ always_ _just_ assumed _that_ _he was_ _too_ [good] _for the_ rest _of the_ [team] . [But _,] I don't _know_ ._ 
B|16| M: [Yeah .] 
A|17| A: Emmett Smith [, yeah .] 
B|18| M: [Yeah ,] that's _the other_ _guy_ that's _, uh [,_ you] [you know .] That's _been_ our _guy_ [of the] [year] _so far ._ 
A|19| A: [he's] [been] [doing real good] . _I'm_ [pretty] impressed with _him_ [so far .] 
B|20| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|21| A: Did _he_ , did _he_ actually play _in_ [the] Pro Bowl [. I] remember _he was_ [like] [a] backup _and_ then somebody got injured _and_ _he was_ supposed [to] go . 
B|22| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|23| A: _Yeah , I_ kind [of] [, I] haven't [been] _keeping_ up with football [, I] mean , _in_ [the] fall [I , I] can go _on_ _and_ _on_ [about] football _, but_ since _it's_ kind [of] off season _, it's_ kind [of] hard [to] _think_ back [about] _all_ _that_ . [But , uh ,] 
B|24| M: [Yeah] 
A|25| A: [Yeah .] 
B|26| M: _They_ _, _they_ had_ [, uh] _they _had_ _a_ , a_ _guy_ _that was_ _in there_ [for a while] [who] [, uh] [he was _a] [,_ he was] an assistant coach [at] _one time_ [for the] Minnesota Minnesota Twins . 
A|27| A: Um [, I] have _no_ idea . 
B|28| M: He's [, uh] [he's] [the] assistant coach [for the] New Orleans Raiders . 
A|29| A: _No_ earthly idea . 
B|30| M: _I've_ [never] _heard of_ [him] . 
A|31| A: How did [they] end up this [year] ? Did [they] , did [they] _make it_ [to] [the] play-offs _at all_ ? 
B|32| M: _Uh _,_ no_ _. They_ [, uh] [they] _didn't_ [make _it] ._ 
A|33| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|34| M: [So ,] 
A|35| A: Kind [of] [like the] cowboys , huh . 
B|36| M: [Yeah .] 
A|37| A: Except _I think_ _the Cowboys_ are _on_ [the] upswing _I don't know_ [about] [the] Vikings 
B|38| M: [Yeah .] 
A|39| A: Just hadn't [heard] much [about] them lately . 
B|40| M: [No] . 
A|41| A: _Yeah . Well ,_ _the Cardinals _,_ I don't [know_ [.] _I] think_ _the Cowboys_ probably have [a , a] [better team] [. They] _just ,_ [at] [the] end [of the] season , [the] kind [of] got messed up with Aikman getting hurt , because [, uh ,] Laufenberg _just_ couldn't ever [really] get [it] together _at all ._ Of course [, he] sat along [the] sidelines _all_ season [, he] [never] [really] got [in] [a] game , [never] did [a] whole [lot] . 
B|42| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|43| A: [Well _,] I'm_ _just_ saying [I] shouldn't [, I] shouldn't blast [him] [like] [that] , say , oh well , Laufenberg got _out_ [there] _and_ blew [it] [for] them [, I] mean [, he] [didn't] get [to] _see_ much action . [But _,] too_ bad . Because _now ,_ _now [,_ [you] _know] [,_ he] [had a] shot _and_ _, and_ [didn't] look _too_ [good] _and_ [so] [, no] one's [going to] have much faith [in] [him] _any_ more . 
B|44| M: Right . 
A|45| A: In fact _, I think_ [they're] getting [a] different [guy] [for a] backup quarterback [. I] haven't _, uh , I_ haven't kept up with [it] lately _, but I_ remember reading something [a] few months ago [about] them signing somebody else _on_ , or , or trying [to] go after somebody or trade [for] somebody _, but_ [it] wasn't anybody I'd [really] [heard of] . [But] [I] [heard] _on_ [the] radio this morning , or yesterday morning , [that] [, uh ,] Aikman's back [in] practicing , [doing real] , [real] well . Um , [who] is [it] , Michael Irvin 
B|46| M: _Uh _,_ I can't_ [think] [of the] guy's name . 
A|47| A: [he] said [that] [, uh ,] Aikman [was] hitting [him] [right] _on_ [the] numbers every _time ._ [So ,] sounds [like] [he's] [going to be] _all_ [right] [for] next season [. They're] _just_ trying [not] [to] overwork [him] [right] _now ,_ until [he] gets his shoulder [, uh ,] back [in] [it] [was] his shoulder , wasn't [it] , [that] [he] [had] [the] problems with ? 
B|48| M: Right . 
A|49| A: _I think_ [it] _, I think_ [it] [was] his shoulder [he] [had] surgery _on_ . [But] _anyway_ [, they're] trying [to] keep [him] [, [you] _know] ,_ keep [him] [, uh ,] _from_ reinjuring anything _, but_ _anyway_ 
B|50| M: [Yeah [, I] don't , [I] , I] [know [,] I guess] [I'm] [a] _big_ _Dallas_ _fan_ _, I'm not_ [a] _big_ _Cowboy fan_ [at all .] 
A|51| A: Thirty day _notice for_ what ? 
B|52| M: Day [notice for] _having_ [your] car checked [out] . 
A|53| A: [Oh , really] . 
B|54| M: [Yeah .] 
A|55| A: What . [Oh _,] okay_ , maybe I'll call [you] back after , after [the] recording is finished . Actually _I think_ we have talked [about] football [for] five minutes [. [I] can't] remember . 
B|56| M: [Yeah [,] okay] . 
A|57| A: Really [. I] usually have _, too_ . 
B|58| M: [I , [I] [, I] don't know [,] I think] _I've [,_ I] _do_ [, [I] always] [, I [just] _,] I'm not_ [real good] [at] [keeping] track [of] [time .] 
A|59| A: [Yeah _,] I've_ done [that] once or twice [. I] [didn't] look [at] [the] clock [when] we started [talking] , [so] [I guess] we should talk [about] football [a] little bit longer [just] [to be] [sure] we got five minutes [in] . 
B|60| M: Right . Right . 
A|61| A: [Yeah .] [So] [other] than [the] Vikings , [who] [do] [you] [like] ? 
B|62| M: [Well [,] I] [like the] packers [. I] [like] _Dallas_ . 
A|63| A: [Uh ,] oh . 
B|64| M: [But [, uh ,] [I] _,] I'm not_ [a] _big_ [, uh] 
A|65| A: [Yeah .] 
B|66| M: [But [, uh ,] I] [like] [to] watch [the Cardinals [,] [and] I] [like the] Giants [, too] [, but I] [like] Philadelphia . 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] Back [when] [they were] [in] _Saint Louis_ ? 
B|68| M: [Yeah , [I] , I] _used [to_ be] [a] _big_ [Saint Louis] [Cardinals] _fan_ , 
A|69| A: Since [they've] [been] [to] Phoenix [they] haven't [been] [, uh ,] [all] [that] impressive [, I guess] [. [I] guess] [I've] [always] [been] [a] [Cowboy fan] . Other than [that] [, I] mean [, [you] [know] ,] [when] [I've [,] [you] [know] ,] [when] [you] grow up [in] [a] city [that] has [the] [, [you] [know] ,] [one] [of the] greatest football teams until [the] [last] few _years_ [, you] kind [of] tend [to] get caught up [in] [it .] 
B|70| M: [Yeah . Well ,] you've [, uh] you've [had] _some_ [good] _years ._ 
A|71| A: [Yeah .] 
B|72| M: [and] [now [,] uh] [you know .] 
A|73| A: [Yeah , I] mean [it] _, it_ [was] [really] exciting , growing up [when] , [when] _the Cowboys_ [were] [really] [big] . Because _my_ parents would [always] have season tickets [, and] they'd go [to] [all] [the] games [, and] [you [know] ,] [the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . It's [just [,] [you] [know] ,] [the] [last] , oh [I guess] probably since [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they] started kind [of] [going] downhill [really] [, but] [, [you] [know] [,] I'm] [just] [used to] [always] growing up [and] hearing _Cowboys ,_ _Cowboys ,_ _Cowboys [,_ and] [, [you] [know] ,] Super Bowl [, and] [all] this [other] stuff . [So [,] I can't] [, [you] [know] [,] I'm [not] going to] decide [I don't] [like] them [just] because [they're] [having] [a] few bad [years [.] I] mean [, I think] they'll pull [out] [of] [it] [, and] [, [you] [know] ,] they'll , they'll wind up being [good] again . They've got [some] , [lot] [of] [really] [good] young players [that] are [going to] , [that] are [going to] [, uh ,] [do] [pretty [good] [,] I think] . [But [,] they're] raising prices _on_ their tickets . [So] [they're] banking _on_ [doing] [good] next season [. [I] think] tickets are , 
B|74| M: [Well [,] I] don [, I've] [never] bought [any] merchandise _from [the_ Cowboys [,] but [I] always] [like] [to] shop [anyway] . 
A|75| A: [Yeah .] 
B|76| M: [I don't know [,] it's] [just] me [and] [my] brother [and] [my] wife [and] our daughter [and] [it's] [, it] seems [like] [it's] [really] [a] sad commentary [on] life [, uh] 
A|77| A: Thirty , or thirty-two [for] [really] [good] tickets . See [, they] [, they] sectioned [it] [out] even more [. They] [used to] [just] have [like] [, uh ,] first [of] [all] [it] [was] [all] [one] price . And then [they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] end zone [and] then everything else . And [now] [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] [from the] , [from] [one] twenty yard line [to] [the other] [one] , [just] [on] [the] lower levels is [the] highest price [, and] then [the] next highest price is [that] same area [but] above [it] [on] [the] upper level [, and] then [like] [from the] twenty [to] [the] ten yard line . And then [they're] [some] sections kind [of] [in] [the] corner areas [, and] then [the] cheapest [of] course is [going to be] [the] end , [the] direct end zones . [But ,] um [, they] have [about] four or five different prices [now ,] [that] [they're] structuring [it] with [, but] obviously [yeah [,] they're] [all] [going] up , more or less is what [it's] [going to] [do] . 
B|78| M: [Oh [,] I] [see] . 
A|79| A: Um [, [you] [know] [,] I'm [not] sure] [, I'm not] positive [, I] [didn't] [, I] [didn't] [really] [think] [about] [that] [. [I] just] remember trying [to] figure [out] where [you] could get [that was] [real] close [to] [the] [good] section [but] [in] [the] little bit cheaper . [But ,] [not] [that] I'll ever go [. I] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [Cowboys] game , [time] , [last] [time] [I] went [to] [the Cowboys] game [was] during [that] , um , N F L strike , or [the] , [when] [they had] [the] scab [team] , teams [in there] [, and] [it] [was] [the] [, uh ,] [Dallas] [and] Washington Redskins game . And [I] went because [my] dad can usually get [a] hold [of] [some] free tickets , because [a lot] [of] those doctors have season tickets [, and] [they] , um , if [they're] [not going to] use them they'll give them [to] somebody else . [So] [my] dad [, I] went with [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one [time] .] [But] [that] wasn't [a] [real] [, [you] [know] [,] it] [was] [, it] [was] [the] scab teams [, it] [was] kind [of] [, [you] [know] [,] it] [was] kind [of] different [, I guess] . And before [that] [it's] [been] quite [a] few [years .] [I've] [been] wanting [to] go [to] [a] game [, I just] [never] , [never] have gotten around [to] [it .] [So] maybe this [year .] 
B|80| M: [Well ,] that's true .
