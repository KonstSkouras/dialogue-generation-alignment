A|87| A: [Well [,] I've] never [had] catfish either [in] [a] restaurant [because] [I'm] from [the] north [and] [that] [was] [a] no no . 
B|88| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [And] [I] haven't gotten [over] [that] from [the] north . 
B|90| M: [Really ?] 
A|91| A: [I know] [they] say [that , that] [is] , 
B|92| M: [You _know ,] _I_ mean [,_ it's] [, [it] [,] it] [really] [is] [good] [for] [you] [to] [eat] [it] . 
A|93| A: [but] [I'm [,] but] they've got [all] these caution signs now [on] fish 
B|94| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [and] [so] [I kind of] stay 
B|96| M:  !!! % !! Remind me . 
A|97| A: Because [of] [all] [the] pollution [in the] lakes [and] [the ,] everywhere [. [I] mean] there [isn't] any safe haven anymore [for] fish . 
B|98| M: [Yeah .] 
A|99| A: [and] especially [, uh ,] [in] Wisconsin [and] Michigan [they] say , no , buying [of] our fish . 
B|100| M: [Yeah .] 
A|101| A: [I ,] [Well [,] yeah .] _So_ [I] am [, and] _the , the_ best brand [of] [chicken] [to] buy [is] [the [, uh] ,] Pilgrim Pride [because] [they] [don't] use [all] these hormones [to] remote [, uh ,] unnatural growth [in] their products . 
B|102| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|103| A: _So_ [I mean [,] [we] have _to] be_ [on] [the] lookout if [we] _want_ [to] stay healthy . 
B|104| M: Right . 
A|105| A: _So_ [I'm [,] I [,] you [know [,] I] ,]

B|120| M: Right . 
A|121| A: [Yeah .] 
B|122| M: [I don't] [know] [. [I] don't] [, I] donno [, I [,] I] just [think] [it's] [, uh [,] I] [think] [it [,] it's] [a] problem [.
