A|39| A: [Yes .] 
B|40| M: _And _, uh ,_ _I_ , _I_ do_ [feel] _that , uh_ . 
A|41| A: [Well [,] that [,] that's] _an_ excellent , [so] actually [that is a] benefit [, uh ,] 
B|42| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|43| A: [Yeah .] 
B|44| M: _so _I_ would_ say [that is] [an] advantage [of] being _a , a_ teacher . 
A|45| A: Right . Right , well [I guess] [that's] [a good] point [, uh ,] 
B|46| M: _And , uh_ . 
A|47| A: [I do] belong [to] [a , a] large corporation or [my] [, that] where [I'm] currently employed [and] there's [, uh ,] there's some different [things] [, uh ,] one [that] [you've] already mentioned _is _,_ is_ [health insurance] [. [I] think] through our [health insurance] [that] [I] can [get] better rates as [a ,] through [a] group [plan] as opposed [to] _going_ [out] [and] getting [health insurance] [on] [an] individual basis [because] [I] had [to do that] at one time [when I] wasn't employed [with] [a] large corporation 
B|48| M: Uh . 
A|49| A: [and that] got [to] be somewhat expensive , [so I] [I think] one [of] [the] [benefits] [I , I] see [is] [the [, uh] _,] is_ [the] group [, uh ,] group discount . 
B|50| M: Uh _, I think_ [that's] wonderful . 
A|51| A: [Yes .] 
B|52| M:  !!!!,!! % !! Remind me [of] [that] now . 
A|53| A: [Yes] , [and] [that's [,] that's] one [thing] [I do] [have] . 
B|54| M: [I'm] [going] [to] [have] [to] remember [that] . 
A|55| A: If [I] didn't [have a] [family] [, I don't] [think] [I would] [have ,] as , as [a] male or as [a ,] as [an] individual [of ,] [in] this stage [of] [my] life [, I don't] [think] [I would] [have] [insurance] [, uh ,] other , 
B|56| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|57| A: [I don't] [think] [I would] [go] through [that] expense . One other benefit [that] [you] mentioned [is] [the] flexible [work] hours [and] [in] [my] previous job [, I really] enjoyed [because] [they] had _what_ was called flex schedule where [I] could [go] [and I] could [work] [, uh ,] nine hour days [and] [have] [like] Friday only [work] four hours 
B|58| M: [Uh-huh .]

B|60| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|61| A: [Well ,] basically [, yeah] [I] had [to do] [, [that [,] uh] _,] the_ same [, uh ,] [for] [about] every quarter [of] [the] [year [.] I] mean [uh ,] [because] [I] was [in] [a ,] [in] [a] position [of] management [I] had responsibilities over people [that [, uh] , I] needed [to] make [my] schedule [, uh ,] [so that] [if] [I] was [not] [there] [I would] [have] coverage [by] some other management personnel , 
B|62| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [so] , [so [I] [, I] think] [that [, uh] [,] that] was [a [,] that] was [an] excellent benefit [that] [I really] enjoyed 
B|64| M: Uh [, yeah .] 
A|65| A: [and [I] [don't] have] [that] [in] [my] current operation , but [, uh [,] you] mentioned [, uh ,] flexible [work] schedule [and] [that's [,] that's] [good] . 
B|66| M: Uh [, [I] ,] 
A|67| A: [And , uh ,] _what_ other [benefits] [do] [you] [think] [are] [important] ? 
B|68| M: [Well [,] [the] , uh] _the , the_ most [important] [thing] [for] me [, [I] guess] [, [is] [,] uh] [I'm] , [I'm] [in the] medical field . 
A|69| A: [Yeah [,] yeah] [, that's] true . 
B|70| M: [I'm] [not] _real_ sure [what] [they're] [going] [to do] [with] it . 
A|71| A: [Well ,] [and] [that's] [an] individual [thing .] 
B|72| M: [Yeah .] 
A|73| A: [Yeah ,] [with] [, uh ,] [with] our current [, uh ,] organization , [we] [do] [have a] [nice] retirement package [and] also [a , a] [nice] [thing] [that , that] [we] [have] [in] our corporation [is [a] [, uh] [,] [is] a] profit sharing [plan] where [we] can [, uh ,] participate [in [the] , the] profits [of] [the] company . If we're [, you know ,] [if] we've been [there] [a] while [and] we're vested [, uh ,] [which] means [that [,] you know ,] [we] [have [a] ,] [an] interest [, uh ,] [in the] company [that] [we] can [, uh ,] [get] some [of] [the] [benefits] [of] [the ,] either [the] profit high times or , or [in] [a] sense , suffer during [the] low times 
B|74| M: Uh , uh-homing . 
A|75| A: [and , uh ,] also [, uh ,] [in] one [of] [my] wife's [, uh ,] companies where she worked , they'd had [a] [real] [nice] profit sharing [plan [that] [, that] ,]
