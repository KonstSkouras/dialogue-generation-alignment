B|2| M: Uh , uh-hints . 
A|3| A: _so_ _I'm_ kind _of_ ready for _the_ pumpkin weather . 
B|4| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: You _don't_ 
B|6| M: No . 
A|7| A: are _you_ _a_ summer _person_ ? 
B|8| M: [I'm] [a] spring [person] . 
A|9| A: Are _you_ ? 
B|10| M: _Yes ._ 
A|11| A: _Well _,_ I_ _have_ [a] friend who's _the_ same way _, and_ anything below sixty , she's _just_ _not_ happy _but_ _I , I_ think _what I would_ miss _is_ _the_ change _of_ seasons _and_ _all_ _because _I_ know_ _in_ Plano _we_ _really_ _don't_ _have_ as many seasons as _, uh ,_ _my_ husband's _from_ Nebraska _, and_ they _have_ _more_ _of_ _the_ four seasons . 
B|12| M: _Oh ,_ [really] ? 
A|13| A: [Oh ,] you're used _to_ _that_ _, too ._ 
B|14| M:  !!! % !! ; !! Remind _me_ _of that_ _time ._ 
A|15| A: You _don't_ _like the_ _cold_ . _Well _,_ I_ usually _like it_ about sweater weather _, and the_ problem here _in_ Plano _is_ _it_ _doesn't_ _last_ very long . 
B|16| M: [Oh] . 
A|17| A: It goes _from_ _hot _,_ and then_ _you_ _get_ [a] couple [of] weeks [of that] Indian Summer _, and then_ _it's_ _cold_ 
B|18| M: Uh . 
A|19| A: _and I_ wish _it_ were several months [of _that] ._ 
B|20| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|21| A: _Well _,_ _I_ don't_ either unless _it's_ _like_ _, uh ,_ some [of] _my_ favorite's _like_ [a] Friday night when _it_ rains _and_ _you_ [really] didn't _have_ anywhere _to_ go _, _and_ it's_ sleeping [time .] But if _you have _to_ get_ _up_ _and_ _get out_ _in_ _it _,_ _I_ don't_ _like it_ either 
B|22| M: [Oh _,] well _,_ that's_ _that's_ [not] bad . 
A|23| A: [Oh , yeah .] _Well ,_ sure _it_ _does ._ That kind [of] schedule _, you_ [really] need [a] lot _more_ sunshine . 
B|24| M: _Yeah ,_ [it] [really] [does .] 
A|25| A: And also _the_ evenings are going _to_ _be_ _getting_ _, uh ,_ darker sooner as _it gets_ cooler . 
B|26| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|27| A: But _I_ did [a] walk _last_ night _, and it_ seemed _like it_ was [a] little bit _hot_ still . Sometimes when _you_ work _up_ [a] sweat _you_ need [it] _to_ _be_ [a] little bit cooler . 
B|28| M: [Oh _,] that's_ _good ._ 
A|29| A: _Well _,_ I_ agree , absolutely _, and_ _you know _,_ it's_ _all_ relative , _because I_ was _from_ West Texas _, and it_ was very dry _, and_ _so_ _I_ thought Dallas was awful _, _and_ I_ still think _so_ _, but_ _then_ this summer _we_ went _to_ Orlando for [a] week _, and it_ was _so_ humid there [that] your , um , _all_ your windows were were wet every morning . _They_ _had_ _to get_ _the_ squeejies _and_ clean them _off_ . 
B|30| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|31| A: And when _we_ got back _to_ Dallas [it] seemed [really] dry _because_ _it's_ kind [of] _like_ _what_ you're used _to_ . But _I_ agree _with_ _you_ _, the_ humidity , especially for curly heads _like_ [me] . 
B|32| M: _Yeah , [I_ , [I] know] . 
A|33| A: [Yes .] [I] _do_ [not] _like the_ 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] !! remind [me] ! Reminders [me] ! 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: [and [it] ,] [it] keeps [the] [, uh [,] the] weeds [out] [and] gives [it] [a] [really] _good_ root [, and it] keeps everything nice [and] green [, and the] sun keeps [the] weeds [from] [getting] [in] [and] [out] [and it's] [a] pretty , pretty place . 
A|37| A: [Yeah , I] think _so_ _too ._ [I know] our _grass_ needs mowing twice as often when [it] rains 
B|38| M: Uh [, [I] , I] [like] [to [get] out] [and] mow [my] [grass] [, too .] 
A|39| A: _but_ [it] _seems like_ here [, _I] would_ _like it_ [to] rain _and then_ _be_ over _, and then_ [not] rain for [a] while . It _seems like_ when _it gets_ stuck _in a_ rain pattern [, that's] _all_ [it] [does .] 
B|40| M: Uh [, [I] , _I] guess_ [that's] [what I would] _do [, too_ .] 
A|41| A: So [, uh _,] but_ [I , I] am ready for [a] little bit [of] [the] cooler weather [and] [not] _so much_ [in] [the] nineties _but_ something [like] , 
B|42| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|43| A: [I guess] [my] , [my] best [would] _be_ probably sixty-eight when _you_ wake _up_ or sixty-six _, and then_ probably seventy-five during [the] day . 
B|44| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|45| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah ,] are _you_ , [do] _you_ _like the_ heat [in] [the] summer _then_ when _it gets_ _up_ [in] [the] nineties [and] hundreds . 
B|46| M: Um , no [, not] [really] [because I] [like the] [, I] [like] [to] [have] [the cool , [the] cool] air [up] above [my] head . 
A|47| A: [Yeah [,] yeah .] 
B|48| M: [I don't] [know ,] [it] [just] [seems [like] [it] gets] [hot ,] [doesn't] [it] ? 
A|49| A: [Yeah .] 
B|50| M: [and I] _can_ [just] [, I] [just] can't deal [with] [that .] 
A|51| A: [Yeah ,] keep [it] there 
B|52| M: [Yeah] 
A|53| A: [Yeah .] 
B|54| M: [I] [like] [to] watch [the] [, the] gymnastics sometimes . 
A|55| A: _Well [,_ I] [do , too] [, I] [do , too] [and] [that] was one thing about [the] _year_ around _school_ [that] originally _we had_ been sort [of] negative on [it] . But _then_ _we_ started thinking , especially [in] Plano [, the] weather _is_ _so_ [hot] [in] August , [that] there [really] isn't [a] lot [the] children [can] [do] outside anyhow . 
B|56| M:  !!! ; !! Remind [me] [that] [we had] [a] [school] football game [last] [year] . 
A|57| A: Static here . 
B|58| M: static _all the_ [time .] 
A|59| A: [Yeah .] We [do] [too .] [I] think [a] lot [of] people agree [the] same . 
B|60| M: [Well ,] 
A|61| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|62| M: [and] [, uh [,] it's] , [it] [just] makes [it] [so much] [more] convenient . 
A|63| A: [Uh-huh] , now there [have] been worse summers . In fact this morning when they were talking about [, uh ,] Harold Taft , they were talking about how this has been one [of] [the] milder [of] [the] summers [and] milder fall , 
B|64| M: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
A|65| A: everybody [seems] [to] _be_ _, you_ [can] tell some [of] [the] newscasters when they [like the] heat , [because] they'll talk about [it] being [so] gorgeous on those days when we're melting [, and] _you_ [can] tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're , it'll _be_ [too] _cold_ [, and] they'll _say , well_ those are [the] ones [that] [like the] _cold_ weather . 
B|66| M: Uh _, well ,_ [we] , [we] live [in a] real [cold] climate . 
A|67| A: [Oh , yeah] _, he_ did _, he_ did . It was [it] was [really] [a] shame . 
B|68| M: [Well [,] he] , he's [just] [a] [, he] [really] [is] _a good_ athlete [, but] he's [, uh] . 
A|69| A: He didn't go [with] [all the] gimmicks [that] some [of] them did . 
B|70| M: [Well [,] that's] true . 
A|71| A: It's kind [of] hard [to] keep on about [the] weather for five minutes 
B|72| M: [Yeah ,] [it] [is] , [it] [really] [is] . 
A|73| A: [Oh ,] [is] [that] right ? Okay . 
B|74| M:  !!! % 
A|75| A: [Oh ,] [good .] 
B|76| M: [They] [just] [say _, well] [,_ [you] know [,] [you] have to] cut [off] [, and then] we'll [be] able [to] play
