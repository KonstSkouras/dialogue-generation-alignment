B|28| M: Uh-uh [. _I] think_ _we're_ _going to_ [have] [to do] _something_ , though _, because_ _I just_ _don't_ _think_ _we_ [can] afford _it ._ 
A|29| A: [Yeah] 
B|30| M: [I'm] _in the_ process _of [,_ uh] 
A|31| A: [I] [can] _hear_ [the] _accent_ _now_ [I] _hear_ [the] [I] _hear_ [the] Western _Pennsylvania ,_ um . 
B|32| M: [Oh [,] yeah ,] I've [, _I] [,_ I] grew _up_ _in_ western [Pennsylvania ,] 
A|33| A: We [live] [, uh [,] we] lived [in] Minneapolis _for_ _about_ five years . 
B|34| M: _Oh , okay ._ 
A|35| A: We [, we] originally lived [in] Dallas _and we_ met [and] _got_ married 
B|36| M: _Uh_ . 
A|37| A: _and then_ , um , actually married [in] Pittsburgh [, and] _that's _,_ that's_ [not] what _they_ _want to_ _hear_ _on_ this call [, uh] 
B|38| M: [Oh _,] really_ ? 
A|39| A: [at] _any_ rate _we came back_ _here_ [with _,] my_ husband [was] transferred _around_ [, uh ,] [up] [to] Minnesota _and now_ _back_ [to] Texas [with] [T] [I] 
B|40| M: _Uh_ . 
A|41| A: [and] [we're] leasing _a , uh ,_ _two_ [story] [town home] _in a_ section [of] Dallas _they_ call [North] Dallas . 
B|42| M: [Oh _,] yeah ._ 
A|43| A: _And [it's_ [,] uh ,] near [a] little [town] called Plano [, well _,] it's not_ little _any_ _more_ . 
B|44| M: _Uh [,_ that's] _right ._ 
A|45| A: [Uh ,] yes [, that's] _out_ near [the] airport . _That's_ _about_ forty-five _miles_ [from] us . 
B|46| M: [That's] [a] _long_ ways . 
A|47| A: _It's [,_ yeah ,] [That's] why [we] [not] sure [, we [,] we're] [not] sure [we] _want _to_ [, uh_ ,] buy down _here [,_ because] [we] actually [, we] lived [up] [north] [long] _enough to_ appreciate [the ,] um , *listen--one utt ? Minneapolis-Saint Paul _is_ [very] clean 
B|48| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|49| A: _you know ,_ [in] terms [of ,] *listen; [with] previous slash unit ? [and] [in] terms [of] housing down _here ,_ um [, you] _really have_ _your_ pick [but _it's] just_ everything's overpriced _for_ [the] economy . 
B|50| M: [Uh [,] well [,] _I] [,_ I] agree [with] [you] [. _I] [,_ uh] _I think [that_ [,] uh] 
A|51| A: [It] _really _is_ _,_ I mean_ [we're [,] we're] _in a_ leased [town home _,] and it's [,_ uh _,] you're_ probably , _your_ teeth will probably fall _out_ figuratively speaking [, it's] nine hundred [a] month . 
B|52| M: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
A|53| A: [But] _, you know_ what , if [you ,] if [you] _get_ anything _under_ five hundred [you] _get_ into what _they_ call high density _living_ _you know , the_ _big_ _apartment_ complexes

B|56| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|57| A: _No ._ 
B|58| M: _but , uh , I don't_ _know _, I_ _think_ [,_ uh] 
A|59| A: [Yeah] this _is [,_ it's] _like a_ duplex _, _like_ a_ _two_ by _two_ _they_ call [it] _like_ [in] Pittsburgh . 
B|60| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|61| A: _And it's_ _nice_ _but it's _,_ I mean [,_ the] girl bought [it] _for a_ hundred [and] ten _, and now_ she can't sell [it _.] And_ _our_ neighbors ,

B|68| M: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] well _,] I don't_ [know [.] I] donno [, _I] _,_ I _just_ [,_ [I] guess] [I] donate [to] _the _, the_ [,_ uh [,] the] school system [, and _I] _,_ and _, and_ [the_ [,] and _it's _,] it's_ just_ _been_ _so_ poorly run [, and] [and [,] uh] . 
A|69| A: [That's] [right .] [Uh-huh] [, yeah [.] [I] have] some friends [that] [live in] Westport [and it's] [really [,] really] bad [. _I] mean_ [you ,] 
B|70| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|71| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: _but it's a_ _good_ [house] .

B|74| M: [Uh [,] well ,] [Clarion] [is] [about] [an] hour _and a half_ _away_ . 
A|75| A: [That's] [not] too bad . [That's] [north] . 
B|76| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|77| A: Are [you] [going] [up] toward [, uh [,] uh _,] I'm_ trying [to] [think] _of the_ name _of that_ [town] [that] starts [with] [an] M , Bradford , no [that's] too far [north] . 
B|78| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|79| A: _So_ _you're_ _, you're not_ [that] far [north] _then_ [, okay .]

A|81| A: [Well _,] you're_ [really] [not] too bad . [Yeah .] 
B|82| M:  !!! % !! RemindMe !! remindMe ! %

B|90| M: [Well [,] _I] [,_ I] [live [in] a] small [town] . 
A|91| A: [Yeah [,] [I think] that] _that's ,_ um [, I] [can] remember [in] Pittsburgh when , this _has_ [to do] [with] homes [, uh ,] indirectly [but] [I] [can] remember when Upper Saint Clair [was] _out_ [in [the] _,] _you know ,_ the_ rural end [of] [Washington] , 
B|92| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|93| A: _and now_ [it's] [it's a] terrible connection . 
B|94| M: [Uh [,] yeah , _I] _,_ I don't_ _know _, it's_ _,_ it _,_ it_ [just] seems [like] _, like I_ donno [, [I'm] [,] I] grew [up] [in the] _south_ [, and _I] think it's_ mostly _, you , [you_ have] [more] [of] [a] southern draw [, _and] a_ southern [accent] [, and] [you] _don't_ [hear] anybody _outside_ [of] [your] immediate [family] . 
A|95| A: [Oh [,] well] [that's] [okay] , um , 
B|96| M: [So] , 
A|97| A: [But] [, [but] [,] yeah ,] substantially _, you know ._ _Um_ , [do] [you] [like] [living] _in an_ older [home] [and] restoring [it] _like that_ ? 
B|98| M:  !!! % !! Remind _me_ [that's a] _real_ _good_ idea . 
A|99| A: How _big_ [is] [it] ? How many _square_ feet [do] [you have] ? 
B|100| M: _It's _about_ a_ [square] foot [and _, and] [,_ uh _,] it's _,_ it _,_ it_ [has] [the [,] uh] _the , the_ [nice] [big] _three_ _rooms_ [and ,] 
A|101| A: [Well] _how_ many [rooms] [do] [you] [think [,] yeah] ? 
B|102| M: _I don't_ _know _, I_ don't_ [think] [I] _could_ fit everything [in] . 
A|103| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: _and we _have_ one_ [on the other side] [of the] den _, and [,_ uh] _we [have_ a] den [that's] completely filled [with] [other] people's stuff [, and [I] think] [that's] [the] only [thing] [that] [we] [really have] trouble [with] [is] [the] _bedrooms_ [because] [, you _know [,] it's_ not] [really] [a] den [but] [a _,] it_ _kind of like [a_ _,] [a_ [,] you're not] [really] supposed _to be_ looking [at] [the] _bedrooms _,_ you just_ _want _to be_ there_ _to be_ entertained , 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [And] [then] _we have_ [an] _outside_ [area] [that] [we] put [up] [, [and] we] put [a _,] a_ pool [, [and] then] [we] put another _one_ _up [._ And] [then] [we're] supposed [to] [go] swimming _, [but _it's_ [,] it's_ not] enclosed , _so_ _we have_ [to] shut [it] off . 
A|107| A: [A] junk room [, yeah] [I] understand [, we have] [that] too . [That's] [, that's] [large] if [your] _children_ aren't [at] [home] _any_ [more] . 
B|108| M: [Yeah [,] well ,] _mine_ [are] [, and] [they] [, and] I've [got] [two] [other] [children] , _so_ [they're] both grown [and _I] don't_ [have a lot of] spare [time] either . 
A|109| A: [That's] [large] if [your] kids aren't [at] [home] _any_ [more] . 
B|110| M: Uh-uh _. Well [,_ [that] , [that] [is] [,] that] [can] _be [,_ uh] ... 
A|111| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|112| M: _we've got_ _a couple of_ houses [around] [our] neighborhood [that] [are] _really [nice_ _,] and the_ _one_ [I'm] [in] _, _it_ doesn't_ [have a] basement . 
A|113| A: [It's] _enough_ space _for_ [two] people [Yeah .] 
B|114| M: [Yeah [,] [I'm] [,] I] [like that] idea . 
A|115| A: [Oh , okay .] 
B|116| M: [So] _, I don't_ _know , [I_ guess] [that's [,] I think] [that's a _,] [a_ [,] that's] [an] advantage [of] having [a] smaller _house _,_ I mean , _it_ doesn't_ necessarily [have] _to be_ bigger _, it's just_ [the] fact [that] [it's] close [enough to] [the] [house] [to] [the] school . 
A|117| A: [Yeah [,] right .] [That's] [okay [.] Well ,] [we've got] , um , this [town] [house] [is] pretty [big] [. It's about] eighteen hundred [square] feet [. It's] [got] [three] [bedrooms ,] [two] [and a half] baths

B|126| M: [Oh] . 
A|127| A: _Right ._ 
B|128| M: _but , uh , _I_ _,_ I don't_ _know _, I_ _just_ [,_ I] [really] _don't_ [have] [any] , [any] strong feelings _one_ _way_ [or] [the other] [about] [it .] 
A|129| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|130| M: [And , uh] .

A|173| A: _I know [,_ and] [it [,] and the] economy [here] [in] Dallas [, I mean [, it] [,] it's] steady [, but [it's] still] [not] [going] [up .] 
B|174| M: [Well _,] I [know ,_ _I] [,_ I think] [that's [,] uh , I don't] [know [,] it] [just] seems [like] [, uh] [you know [, the] , the] only [thing] [that's] [going] [on] [here [,] it] seems [like] [it] seems [, it] [really is] [a] problem [, you know .]

B|180| M: [Yeah , it] sounds [like] [you've] [got] [it] [under] control [, then .] 
A|181| A: [And] [they] thought [they] [were] getting [a] great deal , um [, because] [they] [could] _get_ [a] five hundred thousand dollar [home] [with ,] [they] call [it ,] zero [lot] lines , no property , [And] [it] [would] make [you] ill [to] [see] this . 
B|182| M: [Right .] 
A|183| A: [I mean] [it] [would] probably [be] [like] [your] [house] [on] [, uh [,] you know [,] [a] half] [a] city block [in] Pittsburgh [or] [something] . 
B|184| M: [Yeah , that's] true .
