B|0| M: _Uh_ . 
A|1| A: _and _, uh_ ,_ they had basically decided _that_ there _is_ going to be _a_ real _problem_ here within _a_ _few years_ on solid waste . 
B|2| M: _Uh ,_ yeah . 
A|3| A: Well , _it's_ not too new . 
B|4| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: Oh , they _really_ didn't propose any solutions . Actually , they were _, the_ guy _was_ pretty negative _about_ _the_ things _that_ _the_ government _was_ doing _even_ though _he was_ from _the_ E P A . 
B|6| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|7| A: But _, he_ had _a_ lot _of_ _, uh ,_ facts to , to give _and _, uh_ ,_ things like _how_ many solid waste plants were being shut down _and ,_ _and _, uh_ ,_ one _of_ _the_ most interesting things _that_ _he was_ talking _about_ _was_ _recycling_ _of_ , _of_ news print _. He was_ talking _about_ _, uh _,_ the_ City _of_ New York _and_ _how_ they went _and_ collected all this news print 
B|8| M: _Uh_ . 
A|9| A: _and_ they could sell _it_ for _a_ while . They were able to sell _it_ for some amount per ton _and_ now at this stage _of_ _the_ game where they _have_ gotten into _recycling_ , they've collected so much news print _that_ they _have_ to pay to _have_ _it_ hauled away . 
B|10| M: _Yeah _,_ I_ _, I_ don't know _if _you_ have_ [a] local _paper_ _, but_ _I_ [, uh] 
A|11| A: [Yeah .] We're doing some here _in_ , _in_ Cash Valley _, the_ community here . 
B|12| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|13| A: There's _, uh ,_ we've actually got [a] _kind of_ [a] nice set up . We've got [a] couple _of_ plants here _that_ actually take _, uh ,_ recycled [paper] _and_ shred _it_ _and_ spray _it_ with chemical treatment so _that_ _it's_ not [a] fire hazard _and_ make _it_ into insulation 
B|14| M: _Uh ,_ [how] _do_ _you_ handle [that] ? 
A|15| A: _and_ they _can_ actually use as much recycled [paper] as _the_ community _can_ get to them . Because they are actually buying _it_ _and_ shipping _it_ _in_ from outside . 
B|16| M: Right , right . 
A|17| A: _So_ one _of_ _the_ real keys _, it_ sounds like , to getting _recycling_ for _, uh ,_ [paper] or something like [that] to go _is_ to get some sort _of_ business to actually want _it_ once [you have] collected _it_ . 
B|18| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|19| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|20| M: [and , uh] . 
A|21| A: And there _was_ [a] [paper] presented at this conference from [a] guy from Alabama [and] _he was_ _kind of_ hired to [do] [a] study by two departments for _the_ government . One _was_ like , environmental protection [and] _the_ other one _was_ , oh [, I] can't remember _what_ [, but] _the_ basic idea _, it was_ presented to him _was_ [how] _can we_ maximize _the_ amount _of_ energy [that] _we_ _can_ get back from _recycling_ [and] minimize _the_ volume _of_ stuff [that] _we_ are putting into our landfill 
B|22| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|23| A: [and _, uh] _,_ the_ solution [that] _he_ came up with for plastics , [and] _it was_ _really_ quite amazing _, he_ says , well _the_ best _thing_ to [do] with plastics _is_ to burn them . 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! ; !! LINE !! LINE !! You bet !! That's [the] [kind of] [thing] that's , [that] [I] think that's [really] been [a] major [problem] [in] [the] last [few years] [is] [that] [, uh] ... 
A|25| A: _He_ came to [the] conclusion , plastics [is] actually one [of] [the] biggest problems [in] landfills cause _it's ,_ _it's_ low weight [, but] _it's_ high volume so _it_ takes up [a] lot [of] space 
B|26| M: _Uh_ . 
A|27| A: [and] there's almost no energy , there's very little energy value [in] actually doing [a] lot [of] [the] _recycling_ [, but] there [is] [a] lot [of] energy [in] _it_ [if you] _can_ burn _it_ [and] use _it_ , produce electricity . 
B|28| M: Right , yeah . 
A|29| A: _So_ his solution _was_ to burn plastic . Collect _it_ [and] burn _it_ . 
B|30| M:  !!! % !! translated It's , 
A|31| A: [Yeah .] And _it's_ _more than_ _even_ [paper] or something like [that] . There [is] _more_ energy [in] _it_ per pound or whatever . Well [that] _was_ _he_ didn't deal with [that] . 
B|32| M: _Yeah [,_ I] think [it's [,] it was] [more than] _just_ [paper] [. He was] [even] [, [he] was] [even] [recycling] [the] [, the] tin cans . 
A|33| A: [He] [just] said burn [it] . 
B|34| M: Okay . 
A|35| A: [He] didn't _talk about_ cleaning [it] up or anything like [that] . _So_ [it's] not very practical 
B|36| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [Yeah ,] well , real interesting . 
B|38| M: [So] [, uh ,] [what] else [can we] [talk about] . 
A|39| A: [Uh ,] not too much . [Uh [,] I] got [a] bit . Actually ,
