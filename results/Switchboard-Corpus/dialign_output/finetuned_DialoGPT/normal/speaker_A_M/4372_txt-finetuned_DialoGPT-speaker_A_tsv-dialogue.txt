B|7| M: Uh-huh . 
A|8| A: That's [my] understanding [of the] way [, uh] , [the] way [it] works .

B|9| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|10| A: No .

B|11| M: Oh , okay . 
A|12| A: [Yeah .] 
B|13| M: [But] [I think] [they have] [the] [sales] taxes [in Pennsylvania] based [on] [the] amount [you] [buy] . 
A|14| A: That's true . a a big hole does exist right now [, uh] , [in] [that] consumers can [just] say oh [, I] [, I] forgot [that] .
