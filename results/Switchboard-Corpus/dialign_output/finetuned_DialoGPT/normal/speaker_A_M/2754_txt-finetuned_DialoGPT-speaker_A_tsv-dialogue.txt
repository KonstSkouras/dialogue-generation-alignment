B|26| M: _But , uh_ . 
A|27| A: [Uh [, you] know ,] 
B|28| M: [Yeah .] 
A|29| A: [Yeah .] [But] [it's] funny _that [, uh_ [,] I mean [,] like] [, you know , like] [I] said [I think] last _year_ [was] [the] first _time_ [in] [like] eighteen years [for] [Pennsylvania] . [I'm not] even [sure] [of] [that [,] but] [for] [some] reason _I think [that ,_ you know [,] it] [was] something [like] [that .] _And [,_ it] surprised _, and_ even Florida [, I know] _they have_ _it _, and_ [you_ don't] really _hear_ _about_ [it] real often , [how] many _people_ , 
B|30| M: Uh-uh . 
A|31| A: _Yeah [,_ _but] [, you_ , you] [think that [,] I mean] [if] [you] [think] [of] [how] many premeditated murders _are_ committed [, you know ,] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] [how] many _people_ _are_ being sent [, that] doesn't seem [like] _very_ many . 
B|32| M: [Well] [I [,] I _,] _I think_ , you_ _can_ _see_ [it] _in the_ , _in the_ society [, uh] . 
A|33| A: [Yeah .] 
B|34| M: [But [,] you] don t [have] [to] [be] convicted [of] [a] certain crime [and _you] can't_ _be [,_ you] _can be_ sentenced [to death] [, but] [you] _can_ _only_ [be] sentenced once . 
A|35| A: Everyone [would] appeal _. That's true ,_ [too] .

A|37| A: _Uh-huh_ , uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [And [,] uh ,] [you're] right , there's no _way_ [that you] _can_ ever catch those guys 
A|39| A: _Uh-huh ._ [Yeah .] 
B|40| M: _And then they_ [, [they] _have] a_ waiting period [, _and] [they_ have] [all] [the] information [, you] _can_ find _out_ [about] your license [and] everything . 
A|41| A: _Yeah ,_ uh-huh . 
B|42| M: [So [,] you] _see_ [a] lot [of] _, a_ lot more men _, a_ [a] lot [, uh] _in the_ media [and] [, and] [, uh] . 
A|43| A: [And then they] _get_ [out .] 
B|44| M: [and] [, _and] they_ [, and] [, and] [then] [, you] _see_ _them _in_ the_ headlines [, you] _never_ [know] _who_ _they're_ [, [you] [don't] know] _who_ [to] [believe] _them ._ 
A|45| A: _Yeah [,_ they] _get_ [out] [in] three years _on_ probation , 
B|46| M: [Yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and they] _do_ [it] again _, you know ._ 
B|48| M: [Well ,] that's [true] [. That's true [,] _that] is_ [true] . 
A|49| A: It's [like] [a] slap _on_ [the] fingers [for] [them .] 
B|50| M: _Yeah _, yeah_ [,_ I mean [,] it's] _just [, I don't_ [know] [.] I] donno . 
A|51| A: [I don't [, I] don't [, I] don't _, I] think that_ [it] _should [be_ [,] I mean] [if] [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] someone [did] premeditate someone [, a] murder , [then] [I think [, you] know [,] that] [they] _should_ likewise [, you know ,] someone _should_ take their life _also_ . _But , uh [,_ [but] ,] _are ,_ _are_ [you ,] [would] [you] draw [the] line _there_ [with] [just] [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|52| M: [Uh [, I] [,] I would] _probably_ [say] yes [. I think] [there] [should be] [some] controls _against [it_ , and] [, uh] [I [,] and] [I ,] [there] [should] [also] [be] [some] control _against it_ [if] [it [,] if] [it] does happen [. [Uh ,] I] [also] [think that] [there] [should] _definitely_ [be] [some] penalties [for] [people] _who_ commit certain crimes , such [as] rape [, uh] 
A|53| A: [Yeah .] 
B|54| M: Because [I think] [the] _way_ [the] trial by jury [was] set up [was] [to] make [sure] [that , uh] [that , [that] [, you] , you] knew [that ,] yes , [you're] _guilty_ [, you] _can [be_ ,] you've been charged [with] [a] crime [, and _you] can't_ [, [you] don't] [have] [to] give up your right [to] continue living [with] your crime . 
A|55| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|56| M: [but , uh] . 
A|57| A: [Yeah .] 
B|58| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|59| A: _Uh-huh ._ [Yeah .] 
B|60| M: [And [,] and] [, and] [I] don [, I] don [think] [they have] [the] right [to] [do] [that ,] because [, you , you] [have] [to] [go] through , you've [got] [to] [get] [people that] [are _,] you can't_ _just [,_ [you] don't] [have] [to] [be] [the] _most_ hardened [and] [, uh] [you know .] 
A|61| A: [I think] [some] [of] [them] [would] _rather_ [be] [in] jail 
B|62| M: [Uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [Yeah .] [They] [probably] [have] [it] better [in] jail [than] [what they] [would] [out] [in the] streets . 
B|64| M: Uh-uh _. Well , I_ guess [, I don't [know] [.] [I] _,] I , you know _,_ I've_ [, I] _have a_ [hard] [time] [thinking [that] , uh] [you know] [it's] _a [,_ it's not] [a] problem anymore [, [it] [,] it] seems [like] there's been [a] lot [of] _, you can't_ [say that] [it's [,] it] [just] hasn't been [a] problem [for] [a] [very] long [time] . 
A|65| A: [I don't know [,] uh [,] I was just] _going to_ [say] something [, I] forgot [what] [it] [was] . _Oh [,_ I don't] even remember [what] [it] [was] now . 
B|66| M: [Oh _,] okay_ . 
A|67| A: In Clarion [. Well , I] live [in] Butler [, but] [I'm] at [I'm] at college . [I'm] at Clarion University . 
B|68| M: [Oh _,] okay_ .

B|70| M: Okay . 
A|71| A: _Uh-huh ._ [See] [, yeah [,] okay] [, well ,] [see] [, I'm] _, I'm in_ [kind] _, I'm in_ [kind] [, okay] [, uh ,] _we_ [only] [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|72| M: [Uh [,] okay] 
A|73| A: [Yeah [,] and] [that] [would] [be] pushing [it .] _So [, I_ mean] this [is] [definitely] [a] college town [. Uh ,] we're [about] _two_ hours north [of] Pittsburgh [if] [that] [would] help [you] [out] any [. Uh ,] 
B|74| M: [Yeah .]

B|88| M: Right . 
A|89| A: [Yeah .] [You [know] [, I] think] [people] [can be] persuaded [one] [way] _or_ another . [I've] [never] seriously ran into someone [, I mean] [like] , other [than] my priest [, you know ,] [who] [definitely] says [you can't] take [a [,] you know [,] you can't] take anyone's life [. Uh ,] anyone [that is] [like] [so] [against it] [that you] couldn't persuade [them in] any instance . 
B|90| M: Right . 
A|91| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|92| M: [but , [you] don't] [hear] [, you [, you] hear] stories [about] [people that] [are ,] [you're] [sure] _they're guilty_ . 
A|93| A: [yeah] [Uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [And [,] and] [, and] [I think [, you] , you] [have] [to] [have] [the] [, you] need [to] [have] [some] background [on] [it [, you know] .] 
A|95| A: [Yeah ,] 
B|96| M: [So [, I] [,] [I think [that] ,] that] there's , [there] , [there] [is] [a [,] a] double standard [in] , [in the] courts . 
A|97| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [.] That's] something [, you know] [but [, uh] ,] whether [they] plea bargain _or_ [not] [, if] [they're guilty] [of] murder , [they're guilty] [of] murder [, you know .] 
B|98| M: [Well [, I] mean ,] [the] guy's , [you're] right , he's [not] [going to] [get] off [the] street [for] [a] [year] [or] [two] . 
A|99| A: [So] [I don't] [think that] [they] deserve anything less 
B|100| M: No [, that] seems [rather] shortsighted . 
A|101| A: It's [just [, I don't] [, [I] don't know] , I] [just] 
B|102| M: [I think [that ,] uh] . 
A|103| A: [Uh-huh] [, and] [that] costs money [, yeah .] 
B|104| M: [And ,] 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|106| M: [But , uh [,] I'm not sure] [that , [that] [we] have] [the] right solution [to] [it .]
