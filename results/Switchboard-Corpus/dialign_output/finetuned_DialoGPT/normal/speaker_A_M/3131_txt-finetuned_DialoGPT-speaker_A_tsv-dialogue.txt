B|0| M: _And ,_ uh . 
A|1| A: _So_ _it _was_ pretty_ _much_ _a_ physical _decision_ ? 
B|2| M: _Yeah_ _, [it_ was] [a] [decision] _on_ _the_ _part of the_ _family_ _that_ _she_ felt [was] important . 
A|3| A: _Um_ . 
B|4| M: _And_ _so_ _she [was_ pretty] good _about_ _that_ . 
A|5| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|6| M: _So _,_ I_ guess , uh . 
A|7| A: My husband's [family] _are_ reaching [that] point _but_ _it's _,_ it's_ [so] difficult . Was [she] _in favor_ _of it_ or , or [was] [she] _kind of_ opposed _to_ [it] ? 
B|8| M: [Um] _, I think_ _she was_ sort [of] [in favor] . 
A|9| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|10| M: _And ,_ uh _, _she_ was_ _, she_ _didn't _want to_ be_ _a burden_ anymore _. She_ said [she] didn tinker too [much] _with_ [it] . 
A|11| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|12| M: _and ,_ um . 
A|13| A: [So] often [I think] though , elderly people _don't_ realize [that] _their_ diet is [that] bad . [I] _work_ [with] _a lot_ [of] elderly people , I'm [a] trust officer 
B|14| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hud . 
A|15| A: [and] [so] often they [think] _they're_ adequately caring for themselves _when_ _they're_ _really_ _not_ eating very [much] or very balanced meals . 
B|16| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|17| A: Yes . _Well_ _you know_ _that's_ [part of the] aging process , That _your_ taste buds goes _back to_ [the] sweet taste . 
B|18| M: [Yeah .] 
A|19| A: It _really_ is . 
B|20| M: [I] _know _,_ I_ [know] . 
A|21| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|22| M: _So _,_ I_ mean [, [it's] _,] [it_ was] [a] wonderful movie . 
A|23| A: [Yeah .] 
B|24| M: _So _,_ I_ mean _, she _,_ she_ had [to] [kind of] _take_ over [the] house . 
A|25| A: [And] [the] portions , people _don't_ [want to] try [to] figure out little bitty individual meals . [I] _do_ [that] right now , 
B|26| M: [Yeah] _, I_ [don't] _know _,_ _I_ ,_ _I've_ _never_ tried [it] . _I've_ _, I_ haven't even heard [of it] . 
A|27| A: [and] I'm _not_ near nursing _home_ age . 
B|28| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|29| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] [So] as [a] [family] _you all_ just visited nursing homes or probably [in] College Station there wasn't [a] whole _lot_ [of] choice . 
B|30| M: _Well _,_ they're_ _, they're_ starting _to _make_ that_ , [a lot] . 
A|31| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|32| M: _And ,_ um _, she_ had [to] _go_ [back to] [work] _because_ [she] had cancer . 
A|33| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|34| M: _And ,_ uh . 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|36| M: _And ,_ uh _she was_ _able to_ get _her_ house [back] , 
A|37| A: _Oh_ _yeah ._ That's [a] given . 
B|38| M: [and] [they're] _going _to_ take_ [it] [home] [and] sell [it] [to] _you ._ 
A|39| A: [Uh-huh .] [And] sometimes [the] , [the] help there does [it] [, I think] . 
B|40| M: [Yeah .] 
A|41| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|42| M: _and ,_ uh . 
A|43| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|44| M: _And ,_ uh [I] guess , [you] , [you] need [to] _have_ [a] , [a] , uh [a] monitoring system [in] place [of] [your] desk _where_ [you know] [when] _things_ _like_ [that] [are] _going to happen_ . 
A|45| A: Adapt . 
B|46| M: [Yeah .] 
A|47| A: [Yeah .] [I ,] as [I think] [I] mentioned [, I] [was] [in] [the] trust business [and] [I've] seen [so] many elderly people . Usually there has [to be] some wealth involved , which is great , _if_ , _if_ you're financially , _if_ , _if you_ [don't] [make] [the] decisions [so] late [that] you're worried [about] money _but_ [the] , [the] places [like] Presbyterian Village [and] some [of the] , [the] retirement places [where] , [where] they [have] different levels [of] care seems [to be] [so] [much] _better_ , as far as elderly people adapting . 
B|48| M: Uh-uh . Right . 
A|49| A: They're [able to] move [in] while [they're] _still_ independent [and] _still_ social 
B|50| M: Uh . 
A|51| A: [and _,] and_ they _do_ group [things] . [And] then _if_ health or , or mental capacity deteriorates [, they're] [able [to] take] [the] next steps without [so] [much] change [and] oh [, I] wish everybody _could_ [go] [that] direction rather _than_ just _all_ [of] [a] sudden moving out [of the] [home] they've always been [in] . It's _really_ [kind of] difficult . 
B|52| M: [Yeah .] 
A|53| A: [Yeah .] 
B|54| M: [so] [, I] mean , _we're_ [not] [all] [like] [that] . 
A|55| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|56| M: _because_ , uh . 
A|57| A: [Well] _and it's_ [the] first step [in] , [in] actually accepting [that] [you] [are] failing [and _,] and_ aging . 
B|58| M: [Yeah .] [Yeah] [, [and] ,] uh , [you _know] [,_ I think] , uh [I think] [that's] one [of the] [things] [that] we've come [a] long _way_ _, but_ [I [,] I] guess [it's] [still] , uh . 
A|59| A: You [know] once [you] [make that] step [you know] [that] [it's] just _going to be_ downhill from then [on] [and [,] and] [I've] seen people _really_ fight [it] [that] desperately needed [to make] [the] change . 
B|60| M: [Yeah .] 
A|61| A: They , they became , [in] fact , [that's] probably what's [going to happen] [with] my husband's mother . She's [going to] endanger herself before she'll willingly [and] probably will [never] willingly [make] [the] [decision] . [And] [that] scares me [the] , [the] thought [of] forcing somebody _to do_ something . 
B|62| M: [Yeah .] 
A|63| A: [Yeah .] 
B|64| M: [and ,] 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh .]

A|67| A: Not as independence . 
B|68| M: No . 
A|69| A: [Yeah .] 
B|70| M: [And] [I think] [it] would [be] neat [if you] [could] [have] [a] reunion [with] [your] [family] . 
A|71| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: _And , [and_ ,] [you] , [you] get , [you] [want] them [to be] [able _to] , [to_ do] [their] job . 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] [And] [the] quality [of] life _really_ _isn't_ there . 
B|74| M: No _, it_ [isn't] . 
A|75| A: _Oh_ [it's] tough [, it] _really_ is . 
B|76| M: [I] [know] . 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: _And ,_ uh [, I think] [that's] [a] [really] important thing . 
A|79| A: [Well ,] they fear being dependent [on] somebody . 
B|80| M: [Oh] , [yeah .] 
A|81| A: They , they fear being [a burden] [to , to] [family] members . 
B|82| M: [Yeah .] 
A|83| A: My husband's mother will [have] major surgery [and] we'll find out [about] [it] [in] [a] casual conversation . She'll let something slip [and] we'll say , wait [a] minute . [And , and] [that's] [it] [, she ,] just , well [I] [didn't want to] bother [you [.] She] can't accept [that] _we_ [want to be] [the] care givers . 
B|84| M: Right . 
A|85| A: [Yeah .] [Well [,] she] stayed [, she] stayed [in] [a] temporary nursing [home] . Until [she was] okay . 
B|86| M: [Oh] . 
A|87| A: You [know [,] it's] just [, but] [it's] frightening [to] us [because] _we_ live [pretty] far from [her] . She's down [in] Temple 
B|88| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [and] _we_ can't see [her] often enough [to] [really] [know] what's [going] [on] . 
B|90| M: Uh . 
A|91| A: [So [,] it's] difficult [, it] [really] is [and] [we're] [all] heading [that] [way] [and ,] 
B|92| M: [Well [,] it] sounds [like] [you all] [are] doing [a lot] [better] [than] [we] [are] . 
A|93| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [So] [we're] [going to be] [in] Arlington .
