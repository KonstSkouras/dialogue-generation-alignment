A|3| A: whenever _we_ give arms _to_ _people_ , _as_ _we_ did _, and_ _as_ _we_ sold arms _to ,_ pardon me _, to_ Iraq , when _we_ wanted them _to_ fight Iran _, and_ then _, uh_ _, and_ then _it_ turn around _and ,_ 
B|4| M: Right . 
A|5| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|6| M: But [, uh] . 
A|7| A: _Uh-huh ._ _And_ _I_ _know_ when _I_ spent _, the_ time _that_ I've studied _in_ Mexico [, uh] , Spanish was one _of_ my majors _in_ college _, that [,_ uh] , _there_ was _a_ kind _of_ _a lot of resentment_ _there_ towards _America ,_ 
B|8| M: Oh , _really_ . 
A|9| A: about [, uh] , _like_ you say , using them , our interest _there_ _is_ , you _know ,_ what profit _we_ could make off _of_ any kind _of_ relationship _with_ them , 
B|10| M: Right . 
A|11| A: _and_ _that_ _we_ weren't normally very interested _in_ them _, and_ they have , _in_ other , _in_ _most_ _Latin_ American countries , they , _there_ _are_ _a lot of_ _the_ kind _of_ problems _that_ we've fought _for_ _in_ other countries , you _know _,_ that_ they have corruption _, and , and_ they _don't_ have [, uh] _, I mean _,_ there's_ _just_ very few [really] modern cities . 
B|12| M: Right _, _right_ ._ 
A|13| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|14| M: _the [,_ the] drug lords _and the_ big market up [there] [, and] _that's_ [, that [,] that] _I think_ [is] probably [the] [most] , uh-havings [in] _Latin America ._ 
A|15| A: _Well_ _, that's_ [right] , because [that's] _just_ so much _of_ [the] way [that] they make their money [and] so many communities have [, uh] , have _to_ have [that] _for_ farming 
B|16| M: Uh , 
A|17| A: _And_ they _don't_ look at _it_ so much _as_ , you _know ,_ 
B|18| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|19| A: _Uh-huh ._ That's [right .] 
B|20| M: You [know ,] [we] , [we] [don't] , [we] pay an annual fee [for] [it] [, and , and] _it's [not_ _,] it's really_ [not] too bad _. [I_ mean [,] _I] [,_ _I] think it's_ [a] pretty _good_ idea _, but I_ [don't] _think_ [it] should _be_ mandatory . 
A|21| A: _And_ [I think [it's] really] very sad [that] north _of_ [the] border , you [know [,] the] United States [and] Canada [is] so different , from [the] from South _America [,_ and] Central [America .] 
B|22| M: Oh , yeah . 
A|23| A: There's [really] [a] disparity between [the [,] uh] , what [a] [I] would call civilization _of_ [the] countries , you [know] . 
B|24| M: _Yeah [,_ that's] true . 
A|25| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|26| M: _and , uh_ _it's [not_ _,] it's_ , [it] [is] [not] [just] [a] problem [with] [America ,] [it] , [it] has [to] do [with] [, uh] [the [,] [the] [,] there's] [a lot of resentment] [, I mean [,] the] Mexican [people] [are] , [are] , they're [a lot] more [, uh] ... 
A|27| A: Yes [, it's really] kind [of] sad [, and [,] that] [we] would go all [the] way [to] Iraq [and] [that] [we] would [be] very concerned [with] [the] situation between Jerusalem [and , uh] , Israel [and the] Middle East Arab countries [, and , and] when [we] have , when [we] have [a lot of] problems [, right] [in] our own back door . 
B|28| M: Uh , yeah . 
A|29| A: Um . 
B|30| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|31| A: So _I guess_ we've kind [of] neglected [Latin America .] 
B|32| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|33| A: recently 
B|34| M: Right . 
A|35| A: [Yeah ,] fairly recently . _Well_ [, that's] [really] sad [. I] hadn't thought about [that] [in] [a] long time . 
B|36| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: _Well_ _, I guess_ then [, I] will go [, but [I] ,] 
B|38| M: [Well] [I [,] I] [don't] [know [,] it's] [just] [, [I] ,] [it] seems [like] I'm getting older [and , and] I'm [not] sure if I'm going [to [,] to] stay [as] old [as] [I] want [to] [be] . 
A|39| A: made me stop [and] [think] [a] minute about , [not] worrying so much about [the] Middle East crisis . 
B|40| M: [Yeah] . 
A|41| A: [I] [know] [that] [it's not] settled [but] , [there] [are] other areas [that] [we] could focus our attention on . 
B|42| M: Right . 
A|43| A: [Well] , thank you , you have [a] [good] day . 
B|44| M: You too . 
A|45| A: Bye-bye .
