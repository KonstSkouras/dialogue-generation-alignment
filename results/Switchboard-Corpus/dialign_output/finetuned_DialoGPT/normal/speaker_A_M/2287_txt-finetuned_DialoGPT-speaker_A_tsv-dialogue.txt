B|44| M:  !!! % 
A|45| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|46| M: [and] then we [have] [a] plan [where] [, uh] we [vote] _on_ [the] local mayor

B|48| M: _but_ [you have to] register [and] [, _and] vote ._ And [, uh] . 
A|49| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|50| M: _So [,_ it's] _, _it_ _,_ it_ [really] [is] [a] _good_ [thing] . 
A|51| A: _Yeah [,_ I'm] [in] Dallas [, and] they're long here too . 
B|52| M: [Oh ,] [they] [are] . 
A|53| A: _Yeah [,_ I] voted absentee [one] year _. [I_ really] _was_ going [to] be gone . [So [,] I] [did] [it [,] but] [, uh [,] it] _was_ nice _. I_ would be tempted [to] _do_ [it] again . 
B|54| M: _Well , [it_ [,] it] [is] interesting though , _because I_ [was [,] uh] thinking [about that] [the] _other_ day [, uh] 
A|55| A: [Right .] 
B|56| M: [you can] _just_ [go] [right] _ahead and_ [get] [it] . 
A|57| A: [Yeah _.] [I_ think] [they] should change [the] whole system so [that] [it's] easier 
B|58| M: [Yeah ,] 
A|59| A: [I think] _more_ _people_ would _do_ [it] if [it] wasn't such [a] hassle . 
B|60| M: [Right .] That's true . 
A|61| A: [Uh-huh] , 
B|62| M: _and [I_ think] [that's] [what] [really] works [the] _best_ [. I] [, _I] [don't_ know] how [the] [voting] [is] done [, but] [I think] [it's] done by [more] informed [people [.] I] don tinker with [the] details . [I'm] [not sure] how [it's] run . 
A|63| A: [Yeah [,] that] would be [. I] usually [vote .] A lot [of] times I'll [vote] [a] straight party ticket [just] [because [I] don't] take [the] time [to] find [out] [what] every [, you know ,] [other] than [the] major candidates _, what_ [they] stand for [on] [what] issues , 
B|64| M: Uh [, well] I've [, I] [have] [a] couple [of] parties [that] [I] [vote] [on] . Uh , [one] [of] them [is] [a] woman [, and] [one] [of the] others [is] [a] man _, and I_ [, I think] [I] [, uh] [think] [I] [like] [the] idea [of] [, uh] 
A|65| A: so I'll [just] trust _well _,_ the_ party [kind of] goes along these lines so I'll [go] [ahead [and] vote .] 
B|66| M: _Well ,_ [that's] _good_ . 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: But [, uh] . 
A|69| A: [Yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and] [, and] [, uh] . 
A|71| A: No _, I guess_ it'd be [best] if [you] knew each person [and] [what] [they] stood for [and] why [and] everything . 
B|72| M: [Yeah [,] well [,] I] [do] [, I] [have [,] uh] 
A|73| A: [Right [,] and] try [to] determine if [what] [you] read [was] objective or [not .] 
B|74| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|75| A: [Yeah .] 
B|76| M: And _, and I_ [, I] , 
A|77| A: [Yeah .] 
B|78| M: But [, uh ,] 
A|79| A: [Yeah .] 
B|80| M: _and [I_ think] [that's] [one] [of the] frustrating things . 
A|81| A: [Yeah [,] I think] [it] could affect [the] outcome [, you know ,] could make [it] unfair . 
B|82| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|83| A: [Oh , yeah .] 
B|84| M: And then [it's] [like [,] oh ,] no , no . 
A|85| A: [Yeah _,] the_ press has [a] lot [of] power . 
B|86| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|87| A: [Yeah [,] oh [,] but] , boy [you] try [get] into [that ,] you'd [really] open [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|88| M: [Oh [,] I] [know] . 
A|89| A: [Yeah ,] seems [that] [they] should regulate themselves [a] little bit [, and [I] don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|90| M: _Well [, [I_ think] [that] [,] I] mean [, I] [, uh [,] I guess] [I] agree [that , uh] [the] [, the] [, I] don [, I'm] [not sure] _, I can't think of_ [a] , [a] _good_ example , I've heard [of] [, uh [,] oh [,] well [,] what] [do] [you] call [it] ? The [, uh] 
A|91| A: [Well [, I] can't think of] anything else [really] [about] [the] polls or [voting] , [to] talk [about] .
