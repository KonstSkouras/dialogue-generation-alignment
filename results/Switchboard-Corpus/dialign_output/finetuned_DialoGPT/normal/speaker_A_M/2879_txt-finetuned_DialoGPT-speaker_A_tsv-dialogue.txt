A|37| A: So many times . 
B|38| M: [Yeah [, [and] I] think] [it was] _, it was_ _just a_ publicity thing . You [know ,] [he] went [over] [there] [and] [he] [was] _being_ [, uh ,] excused [because he] _didn't_ _want to be a_ policeman .

B|42| M: [Right] . 
A|43| A: _you , you_ _see_ somebody's mini series [and you] hear [about] somebody's _crime ,_ [there] [was] _something_ on [, and] this gets [back] [to] capital [punishment] _, but_ [the] man [had] stolen [, uh ,] _not_ stolen [but] kidnapped [, uh ,] some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere [in] Florida [and] they changed all [the] facts [that] they said [it was] _true_ 
B|44| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|45| A: [and] they buried her alive 
B|46| M: [Right] . 
A|47| A: [and] Peter Strauss [had] played [the] lead role [and] [the] man [, [and] [,] and] at [the] end [of _,] you know_ how they [have] these mini dramas , at [the] end they said , this set person [was] paroled like six months ago _and you're_ _thinking_ [oh [,] that's] [nice] . 
B|48| M: Oh . 
A|49| A: [I mean _,] you know _,_ _I'm_ not sure_ [that] capital [punishment] serves as [a] deterrence [but] [it] does serve as [a] [uh ,] definite _, you know ,_ lasting 
B|50| M: [Yeah .] 
A|51| A: [Right] , [in] [that] particular instance [, uh _,] [but_ [I] _,] _but_ I don't_ _, [but_ [I] know] [it's] on [a] [and] all [and] [be] all , 
B|52| M: That's [right] . 
A|53| A: [that's] [the] problem [I] [have] [with] _it ,_ [in] Texas they _think it's_ [and] all [and] [be] all , they [think] [that] if they electrocute or slip , or _do something_ , or gas somebody [, uh ,] [that] they're _not_ going [to] [have] [the] crimes [that] they _do_ [have] [and we] happen [to] [live in] Dallas which is extremely _crime ,_ ridden , 
B|54| M: [Uh-huh .] Uh-hue . 
A|55| A: [and we] [just] moved here [, uh ,] we've [been] here before , _lived_ [in] Minneapolis , Saint Paul [, uh ,] which has an exceedingly low _crime_ rate [, and then] [we] were transferred [back] here [, and] _when_ _you're_ gone from some place like [it] [for] [about] six years as [we] were _, you really_ begin [to] _see_ [, uh ,] [just] how problematic [just] living is , even suburban , no matter [where _you] are_ ,

A|63| A: is [that] [in] term , 
B|64| M: [yeah _,] and I'm_ _thinking ,_ um , we're talking [about ,] um 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: [but , uh] . 
A|67| A: Sure . 
B|68| M: _and , uh_ . 
A|69| A: How [would] , how is _the situation_ [in] [there] [in] terms [of] _crime_ [and [,] and] things [that] [would] , 
B|70| M: Well [, [I think] it's] improving . 
A|71| A: _not_ too bad _. Yeah ._ [Uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: [but , uh] . 
A|73| A: Not [the] harsh criminality , [that] [you] find [in] , 
B|74| M: [Yeah .] 
A|75| A: [yeah ,] now , Dallas is [a] [I'm] [being] very sarcastic , [it's [just] a] great [, uh ,] on some days [, uh ,] _it's [,_ uh _, I] don't know_ [the] [good] ole boy network here is [, uh ,] very strange , like [I] said they believe [that ,] if they kill somebody [, you know ,] tit [for] tat [and ,] deed [for] deed [that ,] [that] does _something_ [, uh ,] 
B|76| M: [Yeah [.] Yeah [,] that's] [true] . 
A|77| A: [but] yet they [want] spend [the] money [to] build [the] new jails _that [, I_ mean ,] they [really] _are_ [over] , crowded , 
B|78| M: Oh [, yeah] . 
A|79| A: [I mean [,] that's [,] that's] [just] _not_ [a] cop out [, uh [,] and I] [just , you know _,] I'm_ originally from Pennsylvania which [I think] is basically like New York these days _, _I'm_ not sure_ if they _, I don't_ [think] they [have] capital [punishment] [there .] 
B|80| M: [Yeah .] 
A|81| A: [Uh-huh [.] [Yeah [,] and] I'm] from Pittsburgh [so] [, oh ,] [well ,] we'll forgive each other 
B|82| M: [Yeah .] 
A|83| A: [Uh ,] [because] they use [to be] very , very conservative _when_ _I was_ growing up [I] [and I] [can't] [, I] haven't _lived there_ [in] twenty , years 
B|84| M: [Uh] . 
A|85| A: [but [, uh] ,] 
B|86| M: I've never [been] [there] [and [I] was] [there] [when] [the] first [lady] [that] [lived there] , uh-hugh , she [had] [a] baby [and] everything . 
A|87| A: There [you] _go_ _I don't know_ [that's] [a] different subject , altogether 
B|88| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|89| A: [but [, uh] _, I] don't know_ [I think] everybody [would] feel [it] is same [way] if they were touched by _crime_ _. I think_ everyone [would] [, you] [and I think] _are_ honest [and] candid [because] [we] could _do_ [it] on , [in] this , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|90| M: [Yeah .] 
A|91| A: [but [I] think] everybody if they were touched by [it would] say , if they [had] _any_ sense [of] rage [that] could [be] brought out [, I think] every human does [, I think] they'd say [, yeah ,] 
B|92| M: [I think that's] [true] . 
A|93| A: _do_ [it] if somebody [in] my family or if _it happened_ [it] [me] [, you know ,] 
B|94| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|95| A: [uh ,] 
B|96| M: [I mean [, I] ,] I'd [be] [, I'm] [, I] [would] [be _more] than_ willing [to] [go] into [a] nursing home [and] [just , [you] , you] need [to [,] you really] [do] need [to] [do something] [to] help [the situation] . 
A|97| A: [Uh-huh [.] _Yeah ,] I_ [just ,] [don't] [think] _that [, uh_ [,] you] can rehabilitate [, I mean] [I] [just] [don't] [, uh [,] oh , I] did [a] paper [back] [in] college [a] long time ago [for] criminal justice class [, and I] [just [,] the] subject [, I] remember [we] drew things out [of] [a] hat [and] [it was] [something] [, uh [,] it was] basically [the] essence [was] does [the] _crime_ fit [the punishment] [and] [when] [you] [see] how many repeat offenders [there] _are_ [, uh ,] check , check fraud cases [where] they [go] [to] jail [for] five [to] ten years [and [, uh] ,] rape , rapist getting their hand , [just] slapped _, you know , and_ how [it] is based on [the] judge [and] if [the] time [of] day [that] [the] court is [in] session [, you know ,] all these [, uh ,] intangible things 
B|98| M: [Yeah .] 
A|99| A: _and you're_ [thinking [,] oh [,] you] [would] _not_ only [would] [you] _not_ [want to be a] victim [you] wouldn't [want to be a] criminal either [because] [you] wouldn't [know] _what_ _you're_ getting [, uh] 
B|100| M: [Uh [,] yeah] [. Yeah .] 
A|101| A: [but _,] _I don't know_ ,_ methods [of] capital [punishment] [I] [have] no opinions on [that] either [I] [just]
