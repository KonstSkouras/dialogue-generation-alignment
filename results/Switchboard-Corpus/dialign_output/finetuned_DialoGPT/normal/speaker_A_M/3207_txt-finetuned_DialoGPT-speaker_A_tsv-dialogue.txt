B|0| M: _Oh _,_ really_ ? 
A|1| A: His grandmother too _and they're ,_ _that_ her son , his uncle , whatever _, you know ,_ anyway . He , he _has_ , he's recently retired _and_ _so_ he's _the_ one who _she_ moved _in_ _with_ when _she_ had _a_ stroke _and , and_ all _the_ _other_ children _are_ working or whatever . 
B|2| M:  !!!!,!! % !! _That's_ right . 
A|3| A: They're all my parents age . And _, uh ,_ _so_ he's got _, you know ,_ his retirement though _is_ [really] twenty-four hours _a_ day . They _have_ _a_ day care _two_ days _a_ week . They call _it_ senior citizen day care . But _she_ goes _in_ _the_ senior citizen center . 
B|4| M: Huh . 
A|5| A: So he gets _a_ break _two_ days _a_ week _but_ it's only for _like_ _two_ or three hours _at_ _a_ time . 
B|6| M: Wow . 
A|7| A: And _, you know ,_ _just_ _, you_ see _a_ lot of _things_ _like_ _you _, you_ know ,_ _was_ _a_ great golfer _and_ wanted _to_ play golf when he retired _, and_ _you know_ _that_ _a_ lot of _the_ _things_ he thought he _would_ _do_ when he retired he's _not_ able _to_ _do_ now . 
B|8| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|9| A: But he refuses _to_ consider any _other_ _, I_ _don't_ , 
B|10| M: Well [, I] _think_ [, _I] mean_ , there [are] [so] many [other] [things] [that] [, uh [,] you] [just] _can't_ [do] _, [and _,_ and] I_ don's _, _I _,_ I'm not_ really_ sure _what_ [the] answer [is] . 
A|11| A: _Yeah [,_ and] [is] [that] _how_ your parents _feel_ or , 
B|12| M: [Yeah] . 
A|13| A: Uh-huh . 
B|14| M: She's [not] real _good_ _about_ keeping _up with_ [things] . 
A|15| A: Uh-huh . 
B|16| M: [and] [she] [has] [two] kids [and they're [,] you know ,] [they're] grown _and everything_ , [but] _I mean_ [they're] still [in] school _and I'm_ _like ,_ no [, I] won't , no 
A|17| A: _I know_ _at_ _this _,_ I know_ [I] _feel_ [like] [I] _would_ never [do] [that] [with] my parents either [, you know] . But [I [,] I] [really] _feel_ bad for [the] _people_ [I] see [not] very [, I'm not really] [, really] experienced [but] [like] [I] said [I] [just] _have_ [that] one family [, and I] [just] [really] _feel_ bad for [the] guy who his whole life [is] different now [and ,] than he thought _it_ _would be_ . But , 
B|18| M: [Yeah] . [I] _think_ _that's_ _a _,_ that's_ _probably_ true . [I [,] [you] , you] _probably_ [feel] better [, you] [don't] _you ?_ 
A|19| A: _Yeah [,_ and] he's got [, you know ,] seven brothers [and] sisters [and [, and] [,] uh ,] he's [the] one because he's [the] one [that] isn't going _to_ work every day [and] [that] [she] moved [in] [with] when [she] needed _to_ move [in] [with] someone . And , 
B|20| M: _Oh _,_ that's_ sad . 
A|21| A: [Oh ,] well [, that's] great . 
B|22| M: [Yeah] . 
A|23| A: [That's] [a] [good] idea . We ought _to_ , _Yeah [,_ and] maybe when [the] [other] brothers [and] sisters retire or whatever [, I] [don't] [know] [what] [they're] going _to_ [do] . It's [really] [not] my family . It's my fiancee's [so] [I] [don't] [, I] [can't] say much . 
B|24| M: Well [, I [know] [,] uh] . 
A|25| A: But [I] always [feel] [like] [I] _would_ never put my parents [in] either [and I] wonder [, I'm] going _to be_ [the] only sibling [that] isn't going _to_ _have_ children [so] if my parents [do] need _to_ live [with] someone _, it_ will [probably] _be_ [with] me because all my brothers [and] sisters will _be_ having teenagers around [and everything] _to_ care for . You [know ,] 
B|26| M: Right . 
A|27| A: [and _I'm] [, I_ [,] that's] fine [with] me . my fiancee [and I] both figure [that's] what's , we're going _to_ end [up with] both of [the] parents or whoever . If You [know] [what] [I mean] ? We [feel] [like ,] it's our responsibility , 
B|28| M: [Yeah] . 
A|29| A: [and I] [feel] [like] [I] _would_ never put them _in a_ _home_ . But [I] wonder _how_ much [, you know ,] if one of us [is] going _to_ _have to_ quit work someday or retire early or something . 
B|30| M: Well [, [you] , you] [would be] surprised [at] [how] many [people] [that] [are] staying [home] , you'd _think_ . 
A|31| A: You [think] [about] _it_ [and] it's [really] [, I] [don't] [know] . This country kind of takes [the] worst care of [the] elderly of any [other] country . 
B|32| M: Right . 
A|33| A: And , It's [really] more of [a _,] um_ , [like] [a] respect issue [that] [the] older , older [people] [in] [other] countries [that] _I've_ been _to_ seem _to_ [really] _have_ [a] lot more respect for [the] elderly [people] [and , and] they [really] seem as wise [and , and] [in] _this_ country nobody [really] , _Yeah ,_ nobody [really] pays attention 
B|34| M: [Yeah] . 
A|35| A: [and] they , oh , [the] old-timer made [with] [the] old way [and] nobody respects [the] traditions . And [, you know ,] it's [I , I'm not] saying [that] [I] [do] either [but] [you know ,] it's [just] funny 
B|36| M: Well [, I] guess [I'm , [I] mean] [, I [,] it] , [I've] [, I] [was] raised [in a] generation [that] didn't [have] [this [,] [you] , you] _don't [have_ [to] be] [so] [, um] . 
A|37| A: [and , and] we [really] [don't have] any [that] [don't have] [the] Social Security [and everything] [really] isn't [that] much for elderly [people] [to] live on . 
B|38| M: Right , right . 
A|39| A: You [know ,] even if [they're] [in] [good] health it's incredible . 
B|40| M: Right , right . 
A|41| A: They [don't have] any , they [don't] get special treatment [and] maybe they should [, you know] because we're all going [to] get old someday . 
B|42| M: [Yeah [,] I] agree [with] [you] there . 
A|43| A: And [so] it's [a ,] it's kind of [a] depressing topic though . How old [are] [you ?] 
B|44| M: [I'm [,] I'm] twenty-eight . 
A|45| A: So _it is_ , yeah [, and] [it] must [be] rough for [you] too [to] see your grandmother . 
B|46| M: [Yeah [,] [it] is] .
