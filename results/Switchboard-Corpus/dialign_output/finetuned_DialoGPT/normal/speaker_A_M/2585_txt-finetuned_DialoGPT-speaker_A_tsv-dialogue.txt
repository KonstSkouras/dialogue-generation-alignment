B|28| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|29| A: _Yeah ,_ 
B|30| M: [Yeah .] 
A|31| A: 'cause [they're] farmers . These , _are_ [all] farmers coming _over_ ,

A|33| A: [and] [they're] being put _in the_ middle _of the_ city 
B|34| M: _Uh-huh ._

B|36| M: _Uh-huh ._ Uh-hue . 
A|37| A: These _are_ _people_ who've never _seen_ flat ground before [and] _people_ who've never _seen_ property rights before _.

[And] _there_ _was_ no , real up , upward movement . 
B|38| M: [Yeah .] 
A|39| A: [And _,] not_ being [, you know ,] 
B|40| M: [Uh [,] _not] having_ [any] background knowledge [on ,] [on , uh ,] black [people in the] [work] force . 
A|41| A: Um , 
B|42| M: [And] [the] [other] [thing] [is , [is] [,] you] [see] [these] [, these] _, um [,_ these] young [people that] [are] [just] starting [to get] married [and have] [their] careers [and] [all] [this] , 
A|43| A: [Well ,] 
B|44| M: _Oh _,_ that's_ nice . 
A|45| A: [I , I] wasn't helping _them_ . [I] worked _with_ _them_ [, not] [to] _help_ _them_ , but for _my_ own purposes . I'm , I'm _a_ linguist _and I_ _was [,_ uh ,] doing _a_ _language ,_ trying [to] _learn_ [their] _language ,_ _a_ _little_ bit . [And] [I] actually [, um _,] _I mean_ ,_ helped _them_ _them_ [in the] sense [that] _they_ received money for working _with_ me . [But] [I] _didn't_ [, I] _didn't_ [, I] wasn't _a_ _social_ worker or anything _like that ._ 
B|46| M: _Oh , you_ did . 
A|47| A: [I] _do_ [have] friends who [have] tried _to do_ more , _social_ [work] [, you know ,] by explaining [to] [people] _how_ _the language [,_ and] _what_ [the] problems [learning] English might _be_ [and] such . 
B|48| M: Right _. Uh-huh ._ 
A|49| A: Because [all] [the] models _of_ teaching English [are] based [on] teaching English [to] Spanish speakers or [to] [other] European _language_ speakers . [And] [people] _don't_ realize _how_ _different_ _some of the_ languages _they_ speak [are] . 
B|50| M: Right . 
A|51| A: [Oh , you] [are] ? 
B|52| M: [Uh ,] 
A|53| A: [Uh-huh] _, well_ _you ,_ 
B|54| M: [And] [you have] [to] [have a] computer [to [do] [that] .] 
A|55| A: _That's_ [, that's] _been_ _my_ impression . 
B|56| M: [And , uh [,] [I] [know] ,] uh-hope [, you know ,] we're [going to] [have] [to do] [something] [in the] next couple [of] years [, uh] . 
A|57| A: [Yeah .] It's _, it's_ [not] [, they're] [not] withholding information , 
B|58| M: Uh-uh . 
A|59| A: _they_ [just] _don't have_ [that] information . 
B|60| M: _Yeah , yeah ._ 
A|61| A: They _, they_ haven't [the] foggiest idea . 
B|62| M: [That's] true . 
A|63| A: Yes . 
B|64| M: [And] [I've] [been] [with the] company [a] couple [of] _times_ [and [,] uh [,] it's _,] _it_ _,_ it_ works [out] _pretty_ [well] . 
A|65| A: [And] Spanish [is ,] [pretty] close [to] English , _really_ . 
B|66| M: Right . 
A|67| A: [And] Spanish _is a_ lot _like_ English . 
B|68| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|69| A: [Yeah .] 
B|70| M: [and _, and] [,_ uh , so] we , we [, uh] we [try] [to] keep [that] [in] mind [, you know ,] [because] [, uh] [you know] we [try] [and [,] [you] can't] always [get] everything . 
A|71| A: [Yeah , yeah [.] Yeah .] 
B|72| M: [And] [then _,] and [,_ [you] [,] you're] [like] [, well [, I] [don't] [know] .] 
A|73| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh [. Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|74| M: [I , I] [really] [like that .] 
A|75| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|76| M: [And , uh] [and _I] think it's a wonderful thing_ [that , that the] school can offer [that] kind [of] exposure [to [,] uh] [uh ,] [other] cultures . 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh [.] Uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: _I , I think_ [that's the] only [way] [I] can [really] [help] direct [my] , [my] opinion [on] [it .] 
A|79| A: [Oh ,] I'm sure [it] would . 
B|80| M: [Yeah .] 
A|81| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|82| M: _But [,_ uh _,] _it_ _,_ I think_ [it] varies [, uh] . 
A|83| A: [Yeah [,] it] would _be_ [a] _good_ experience [, and] you'd _be_ helping [people] , I'm sure . Very much . [And] [and _I] mean [,_ not] [to] put [, not] [to] trivialize [the] problems [of] [any] immigrant group but [I] [do] _know the_ Asian groups [are] [having] [a] lot [of] trouble . _I mean [,_ and] part _of the_ problem [is] [that ,] [a] lot [of] Chinese [and] _Japanese_ immigration from [, you know ,] decades ago has [been] very _successful_ [because] _they_ valued education [and] [so] forth . 
B|84| M: Right . 
A|85| A: They became [a] very _successful_ immigrant group . [But [,] and ,] but [a] lot [of] [people] coming _over_ from Vietnam , right _now ,_ coming from worn torn countries , [are] , [are] [not having] [the] same success . [I think] _some_ [people] [have] [just] assumed [, well ,] why , why [can't] [you] _be successful_ ? The _Japanese_ were , or [the] Chinese were , or [something] . [And] [it's] [really] much more complicated . 
B|86| M: [Well [,] _I , I] think it's_ true [that , that the] [, the] [Japanese] [, [you] [,] [you] have] [to] [think] [about] [, uh [,] the] [, uh] [you [know] the] , [what] , what's [the] , [how] can [you do] [it] ? 
A|87| A: [Yeah [,] the] [times] [are] _different_ [, yeah .] 
B|88| M: [You know [,] I mean] [they] [didn't] [have the] ability [to [be] successful] [, you] [just] [had] [to] go [out] [and] [do] [what] [you] [had] _to do ._ 
A|89| A: [Uh-huh [.] Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|90| M: [And , uh [,] you know [,] that's] [, [that] , [that] [is ,] that] [really] [is a] [different] [situation] . 
A|91| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|92| M: [So] [, you know ,] he [just] kind [of] goes [over there] [and] joins [in and] helps [them] [learn] [the language [,] you know .] 
A|93| A: [Oh [,] yeah .] [I , [I think it's] a wonderful thing] [to do .] [And] there's [a] lot , there's [a] lot more [, I] guess another possible solution [is ,] since taxpayers aren't [going to] start paying more money for [this] [and , and] [other] budgets aren't [going [to] be] cut [to] pay for [it [,] uh ,] more _of the_ volunteer network service . 
B|94| M:  !!! % [Yeah [,] that's] true . [That's] true , 
A|95| A: Because everyone gains from [it .] 
B|96| M: Right . 
A|97| A: Would [be] , would , might [be] [really] useful . [Uh [,] and] if [it's [,] you know [,] uh _,] just_ [people] helping [people] [I think] makes , makes [the] community [so] much happier . 
B|98| M:  !!! % [Well [,] [I] [know] [,] I [,] uh] [I've] [seen] [some of the] programs [on , uh] [uh ,] T V [where] [they [,] uh] [they] offer programs [like] [, uh] [to] recycle [. You know [,] like] [, the] [, uh] [the] [, the] [little] [, uh] aluminum can bottles [and] stuff [like that .] 
A|99| A: [Uh-huh .] Yes . 
B|100| M: [And , uh] . 
A|101| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|102| M: [I mean [,] [they're] [,] they [have] a] lower level [of] intelligence , lower level , lower salaries , lower [crime] rate [, you] name [it [,] they [don't have] the] [social] skills [that [,] uh] 
A|103| A: Yes , yes [, I've] known [people] [with] effectively worthless degrees [in] [this] country . [I mean [,] and] [they're] highly educated [people] , but [of] course , if [you're] educated [and] [you] [don't] speak English , no one thinks anything [of] _you ._ 
B|104| M: [That's] true . 
A|105| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
B|106| M: [And] she [was ,] she [was] selling drugs [and] she [was] caught [just [,] [just] , you know [,] just] [a few] weeks later [, I mean] [it was] [just] [a] couple [of] weeks later . 
A|107| A: [Yeah [,] I] [do] too . [Well ,] It's [been] _good talking_ [with] _you ._ 
B|108| M: _Okay ,_ [good talking] [to] [you .] Take _care_ . 
A|109| A: [Uh ,] okay . 
B|110| M: Bye-bye . 
A|111| A: [Okay [,] it] does sound [like] [you have] [some] [children] [to] take [care] [of] 
B|112| M: [Well] [they're , they're] both grown [now [,] so] .
