A|7| A: _Uh ,_ yeah . We actually [do] some _work_ _with_ some _people_ down at Georgia Tech .

A|9| A: _Uh [,_ and [, uh] ,] so _we're _,_ we're_ part _, we're_ actually part _of_ M [I] T . _So_ _it's_ _very_ [much] [the] same kind _of_ place [and _, uh] the_ technical institution . 
B|10| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|11| A: _Uh ,_ while [I] was sitting here waiting while [they] tried [to] find somebody _for_ me [to] talk [to] , [trying to] [think] _of_ _what_ [, uh [,] uh ,] _what_ things were important [, uh ,] besides salary [and] [a] [, and] [a] job _. _I_ guess_ [, uh ,] list [I] had scribbled down was _the people_ _you_ worked _with_ [and] maybe _the _, uh ,_ the_ challenge _of the_ _work_ [and _, uh] the_ working conditions , things like _that ._ 
B|12| M: _Yeah ._ _Yeah ._ _Yeah_ [, _I] think [,_ _I] don't know_ [, I , _I] know_ [that] there _are_ [a] lot [of] [people] who [, uh] 
A|13| A: [I don't know] . What [are] your [, uh ,] _what_ sorts [of] things _would_ _you_ consider important ? 
B|14| M: [Well [,] uh] . 
A|15| A: Uh-huh . 
B|16| M: _And I think_ [that] [, uh] _I think , uh_ [you] [know] , we've [, [we're] ,] we _have to_ be careful _about_ [what] we [do] [with] them . 
A|17| A: Uh-huh . 
B|18| M: _And , uh_ [you] [know] , [people] , [they] [don't] want [to] be called out [for] something they're not supposed [to] be doing . 
A|19| A: [Yeah .] 
B|20| M: _And , uh_ . 
A|21| A: Uh-huh . 
B|22| M: [So] [they] _just_ sort [of] _, you_ can't say , okay [, we're] not going [to] [do] this , we won't [do] this . We're _just_ going [to] let [you] go _. And_ then [they] [would] come in [and] say , you're not _, you_ [don't] _have to_ _do [that_ .] 
A|23| A: Uh-huh . 
B|24| M: But [they] could _, you_ could make _it_ [a] practice . 
A|25| A: Uh-huh . 
B|26| M: [I] _mean_ , that's , [that] [would] be [a] good way [to] [do] _it_ . 
A|27| A: Now how [do] [you] [mean] [that] ? [I know] [it] , 
B|28| M: It's [, uh] . 
A|29| A: Uh-huh . 
B|30| M: [I] [mean] , _I've_ seen [it] in other places [and] [it's] [, uh [,] [I] guess] [it's] almost impossible [to] say [it's] any worse _than_ any other _company_ [, uh] . 
A|31| A: Uh-huh . 
B|32| M: _And_ that's , that's [a] negative [of] mine [. [I] [, I] [,] the] only [, the] one [, [the] , uh ,] one positive [that] [I] see is [that] [they] [don't] _have_ enough time [to] devote [to] [the] needs [of [the] people] . 
A|33| A: [Well [,] you] [, you] [think] [it's] _better_ [than] [to] , [to] try [to] spread [the [,] the] effort equally among all [the] employees [of the] [company] or , 
B|34| M: [Uh [,] _I] think_ [it] [would] be [better] [to] _have_ _, have_ [, uh , [the] [, uh] the] unanimous vote . 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . 
B|36| M: _I think_ [that] [, uh ,] [that] [the , uh] ... 
A|37| A: Uh-huh . 
B|38| M: [and] [they] could see [that] there's [a] lot [of] [people] [that] [don't] want [to] [work] . 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] Uh-huh . 
B|40| M: _And I think_ that's [, _I] think_ they're both [very] true . 
A|41| A: [Yeah .] [I've] heard [of] [a] couple [of] companies [that] [have] done [that [.] [I] think [, uh] ,] back [about] , [a few] years ago when things were tough , Hewlett-Packard did [that] [for] awhile . They went [to] [a] [, uh ,] [a] , [a] four [and] [a] half day [work] week rather [than] cut , yeah , [just] cut everybody back ten percent [. [And] [, uh] [,] [have] to] , give everybody [a] half day [a] week off . 
B|42| M: Right . 
A|43| A: [And I think] [you] can [do that] [for] [a] little while but [I'm] , 
B|44| M: [Yeah] , [that] , [that] [would] be [a] good idea . 
A|45| A: [Yeah .]
