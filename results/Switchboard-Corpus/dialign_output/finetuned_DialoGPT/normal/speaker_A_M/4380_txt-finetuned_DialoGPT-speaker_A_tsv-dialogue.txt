A|1| A: _I_ got _a friend_ who _goes_ there , by _the_ way _I_ want _to_ talk _to_ _you_ _about_ _that_ afterward , okay . 
B|2| M: _Yeah _._ Well _,_ I_ _have_ [a friend] [that] [goes] [to] Tech also _, and_ _, uh_ she [goes] _to _,_ uh_ _the _,_ uh_ [to] [the] University _of_ Small Town _, which_ _is_ _in_ Wichita Falls _. _And ,_ uh_ _I mean _, I_ _, I_ don't_ _know ,_ I've heard [about] _it_ _, but _I_ haven't_ heard [about] [the] program . 
A|3| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] was [a] , [a] , it's _more_ or less [a] suburban school system ? 
B|4| M: Uh-huh . 
A|5| A: Yes . That , [that] was _true_ for mine too . Uh , although [I] _I'm sure_ [to] some extent , [that] _money_ [is] part [of] [the] problem [in] [the] disparity [, but [I] don't] _think [,_ I] honestly [don't] _think_ _that's_ [the] biggest part _of it ._ _You know _,_ I think_ _that , uh_ _, I mean I_ [know] [that] [in] my town _, you_ [know ,] most [of] [the ,] most [of] [the] parents , they're valued education . 
B|6| M: Uh-huh . 
A|7| A: [And , uh] _you_ [know [,] and] so [the] students were _, you_ [know ,] [to] some extent , motivated [to] learn . 
B|8| M: _Yeah , that's true ._ 
A|9| A: [I mean] [know] 
B|10| M: [You know ,] 
A|11| A: [Yeah , that's true .] But [but] [, uh] _, I think _,_ I mean_ even _more_ than _that ,_ even _, I mean_ if _you_ drop out [in] high school _you_ should still be able [to] read _you_ [know] ? Which [it] [I mean] [it] sounds _like_ [, uh] , 
B|12| M: [Yeah] 
A|13| A: now _I think_ maybe it's started changing [in] [the] past few years because [, uh] , _they_ [have] [of] these [, uh] , sort [of] mandatory tests if _you_ [have] [to] take before _you get_ [a] diploma . 
B|14| M: [Yeah] 
A|15| A: But [, uh] [, but] [, uh] , certainly before _that ,_ there were people _that _,_ you_ [know ,] would graduate from high school [and] _could_ barely read . Uh [, and] [that's] just sort [of] inexcusable [and] _you_ can't really [, I _, I] , I mean I_ just can't even picture _how_ [that] _could_ happen . [You know ,] except maybe [to] someone whose _, you_ [know ,] really badly learning [, uh] , disabled or something . 
B|16| M: [Yeah .] 
A|17| A: But these people obviously weren't . 
B|18| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that] 
A|19| A: [Yeah .] 
B|20| M: [And , uh] 
A|21| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|22| M: [and] [I'm sure] [that , uh] ... 
A|23| A: [Yeah [.] _And] _I_ think_ [that's] almost [a] bigger factor , than anything else probably . [I mean [, I] don't] _, I think_ _you_ [know ,] people just , 
B|24| M: [Yeah ,] _well_ [, I , I mean I] don tinker with drugs [, but [I] [,] uh] _I do [,_ uh] 
A|25| A: [Yeah [.] And ,] again [, I don't] [, I mean] got [know] [the _,] you_ [know ,] _how_ qualified [, [I mean] _, I] think_ it'd be interesting [to _,] you_ [know ,] [to] spend [a] couple [of] days just looking around an inner city school . Uh _, you_ [know ,] sort , sort [of] maybe from elementary through [, uh] , high school . [You know ,] just sort [of] [to] _get_ [a] feel for what it's _like_ . 
B|26| M: Uh-huh . Uh-hue . 
A|27| A: _I think_ that'd be an interesting experience . But [, uh] [, [I] haven't] done [that] 
B|28| M: [Yeah [,] I ,] I've heard [of it .] 
A|29| A: But [I do [,] [I] do] _think_ [that , uh] [, [I mean] ,] _public_ education [in] general _I think_ can work [. _And] _I_ think_ it's [a] good thing . 
B|30| M: [Yeah .] 
A|31| A: [Yeah .] 
B|32| M: [And] [I'm] not [sure] [how] _well_ [that] [is] . 
A|33| A: Yes . 
B|34| M: [And] [they] _could have_ had [a] lot [more] [money] . 
A|35| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] [I mean [, I] don't] [, I] honestly [don't] really _think_ [I] [could have] _, you_ [know ,] done much better than [I] did [in] [the] school system [I] was [in] . [mean] 
B|36| M: Uh-huh . 
A|37| A: [Yeah .] 
B|38| M: [And I] don [, I think ,] I'd [like] [to] see them [, I] wish they'd _start_ with [, you] , first [of] _all_ [you get] _into_ [the [,] uh] [public] schools [, and] then [you get] [to] [the] private ones . 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] [I mean [,] and] [and] [in] [the ,] once [you] junior high [, uh] , [start] junior high , starting [in] eighth grade [all] [the] way through high school , there were four levels [. Well ,] no [, I] guess [it] [in] junior high , [it] was still three . Then [in] high school [it] changed [into] four levels [of] [, uh] , [of] instruction [in] [the] major subjects . Uh [, which] , 
B|40| M: Uh-huh . 
A|41| A: [I mean ,] actually [I think] [that] works pretty [well] . [and] [that ,] [that] makes ,
