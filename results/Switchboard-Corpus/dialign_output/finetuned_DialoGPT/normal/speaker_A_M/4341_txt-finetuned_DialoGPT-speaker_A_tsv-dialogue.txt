A|3| A: So you're [in] , you're _in favor_ _of_ capital punishment , _then_ . 
B|4| M: Well _, I_ _think_ _, I_ mean _I_ _think_ _it's a_ good thing _, _but_ I_ _think _that_ it's_ _, I don't _know_ _,_ it's_ _something_ _that_ needs _to be_ taken care [of] . 
A|5| A: _Right_ . 
B|6| M: But _, uh _,_ I _, I don't_ know_ _. _I_ guess_ I'd _have to_ say _that_ _I'm not_ [in favor] _. Uh _,_ I_ _think_ _it's a_ pretty good idea . 
A|7| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Needs [to be] punished _or_ [, uh ,] eliminated from _society_ . 
B|8| M: Yeah . 
A|9| A: _Right_ . And _then_ do _it_ all over _again ._ Uh-huh . 
B|10| M: Yeah . 
A|11| A: _Right_ . Have [to] [agree with _you] [,_ and] [I'm] kind [of] [in favor] [of] capital punishment also [. I] _just_ [don't] [think that] _it_ acts much as [a] deterrent [to] these _people_ because [, uh _,] you_ still _see them_ committing _the_ same crimes [, _but] [,_ I] tend [to] [agree with you] _that [,_ uh ,] we should [have] _it_ [I] _just_ [, I don't _know] [that_ it's] always effective [but [I] guess] we [, uh ,] we're kind [of] stuck [with] _it_ .

B|12| M: _Right ,_ _right_ . 
A|13| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . [Right ,] uh-huh . 
B|14| M: [and] _then you_ [see _them] in jail_ [for a] year [or] two [and] _they're_ out doing [it] [again .] 
A|15| A: Uh-huh , huh . Do [you] [think] they should [be] punished at all , [or] [, uh ,] like go [to] prison [, uh ,] because [they're] [not] really _a danger_ [to] _society_ . It was almost really self defense , isn't [it] , [in] [a] case like [that] . 
B|16| M: Yeah [. _I] _, I_ [,_ [you] [,] you] can't say [that] [they're] , _they're a danger_ [, [but] _I] [,_ uh] .

A|19| A: _I know_ they put [, uh ,] put [them in jail] sometimes [, [I] guess] [. Uh ,] 
B|20| M: [Uh ,] well , 
A|21| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Um . Uh-huh . You [know ,] now [, I] wonder what [you] [think] about this [and [,] uh ,] unfortunately , we , we [don't] get [to] do [it] [, [but] [, uh] ,] [it] used [to be] [a] long time ago [, [I] guess] [in] Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did [something] , [for] example , [to] your family , [then you] had _the_ [right] [to] administer _the_ punishment . So if somebody killed somebody [in] your family [then you] had _the_ [right] [to] [, uh ,] if [that] person was caught [and] found guilty [, you] had _the_ [right] [to] [, uh ,] execute [that] person . And _I know _that_ [,_ uh ,] if somebody had done [something] [to] my family [, I] _would_ feel [that] [I] had _the_ [right] [to] , [to] get revenge on [them] [and [,] uh [,] [but] [,] I , I don't] [think] that's done much anywhere _That's_ kind [of] drastic punishment . 
B|22| M: Well [, [I] [know] [,] uh] 
A|23| A: [Right] . 
B|24| M: But [, uh] . 
A|25| A: Might make [you] feel better [but] 
B|26| M: Well [I ,] 
A|27| A: Uh-huh . [Right] . 
B|28| M: Because [I know that] there _are_ _a lot of_ [people] who [would] [be] willing [to] give up their American citizenship [just] [for] [that] _very_ reason . 
A|29| A: Uh-huh . [Right] . Uh-huh . [Right ,] because [they're a danger] [to] everybody else . Huh , that's interesting [. I] [have to] [, uh] [agree with] [that] . 
B|30| M:  !!!!,!! [That's] [right] . 
A|31| A: There's [a lot of] folks , probably _, that_ [are] [in] prison _that [,_ uh _,] that_ aren't really [a danger] [to] _society_ , huh [, [and] [,] uh ,] 
B|32| M: Yeah , yeah [, I] [think [that] [,] that] there's [a] , [a lot] , [a] big part [of] [it] is [, uh] [uh ,] [the] , [the] [society] doesn't understand [, uh] . 
A|33| A: [Right] . [Right ,] probably more [of] [them] [then] [the] other way around Interesting [. [I] don't] [, I don't] , [not] sure [I ,] [I'm] [in] Washington , D C [or] at least [very] close [to] [it] . [I'm not] sure what kind [of] [, uh ,] capital punishment we [have] here . 
B|34| M: Uh-uh .
