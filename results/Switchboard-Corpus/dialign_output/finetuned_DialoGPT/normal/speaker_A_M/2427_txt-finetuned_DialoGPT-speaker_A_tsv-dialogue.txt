B|114| M: _and [, uh [,_ you know ,] the] [, the] texture [of] [it is] [just] wonderful . 
A|115| A: [Uh-huh .] _That's right ._ 
B|116| M: [and I] went [and I] took [it] back [and I] [put] [it] back [in the] middle [of the] [garden] [and] [it was] dead . 
A|117| A: Absolutely . They [really] [go] through [it ,]
