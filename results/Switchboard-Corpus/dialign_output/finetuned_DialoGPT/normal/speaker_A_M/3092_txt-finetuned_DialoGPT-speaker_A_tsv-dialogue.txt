A|49| A: _Right ,_ [that] _you ,_ [Right .] _That's _right_ ._ 
B|50| M: _So [,_ uh ,] 
A|51| A: With [the company] than , than having [to] [go] , [That's] [, that's] _right ._ [Yes] [, I ,] agree [with] [that] . 
B|52| M:  !!!!,!! [That's right] , you're [right .] _That would [be_ _a] lot_ cheaper .

A|61| A: Vision _, I guess_ _it's_ called , vision care . 
B|62| M: [Yeah .] 
A|63| A: It depends on who examines [your] eyes . 
B|64| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|65| A: If [you] [have] an , an optometrist [or] an ophthalmologist , there's [a] vast difference [in] those two [, uh ,] professionals .

A|67| A: Glaucoma . 
B|68| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|69| A: _Oh ._ _Oh , okay_ _, _so_ ,_

A|71| A: [Yes .] 
B|72| M: [and she is] [just] [, [she] just] loves [it] . 
A|73| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yes] [, they] [are] . 
B|74| M: [And] [I think] [, you know [,] [the] [,] the] costuming [and] everything [, I think] [it's] [about] twenty-five dollars . 
A|75| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|76| M: [but [,] uh , she] [has , uh] [she] [has] _had to [have_ a] [, a] private sitter , 
A|77| A: _Right [,_ that's] critical , _because_ she's [in] need [of] [it] [so] often . 
B|78| M: [Right .] [Right .] 
A|79| A: [Yes] [, and [,] you know ,] [we] [have] [, uh ,] needs [in] our life [that are] unique [to] us [and [, uh] [,] you know ,] people [have] needs [in] their life [that] unique [to] us , [to] them . 
B|80| M: Uh-uh . [Right .]

A|83| A: [Well , no] [that's] my other phone . 
B|84| M: [Oh , _okay] ._ 
A|85| A: [So [,] that's] [it] [that's] [okay] , my , [that] phone [is] ringing [to] an empty desk [and] she's on vacation , 
B|86| M: [Oh [,] no] 
A|87| A: [so ,] [it's] [okay .] 
B|88| M: [Okay [,] um [,] I] don't [know [,] I think] we're supposed [to] [talk about] [the] changing roles [of] women [, _in] the_ [work] place [, in] today's [work] place [and [,] um] . 
A|89| A: [Uh-huh .] [That's] very _expensive_ . 
B|90| M: [but [,] but] [it's , _it] [,_ it is] [expensive] [, and] [it's] [really] , 
A|91| A: [Yes] [, that's] true . Orthodontic [work] [is] terribly [expensive] . 
B|92| M: [And , uh [,] so] [I] don't [know [,] I [,] I'm] [, I guess] [I'm] biased [because] [I'm] [a] [, a] medical doctor [and so] I've seen some [things [that] are] [just] [, you know ,] over priced , over thought , 
A|93| A: Especially [when you] [have [a] lot] [of] problems [with] [the] children teeth [, [and ,] and] [you] [have to] [really] [get] them [when] [they] [are] young [, in] order [to have] [, uh ,] [not [,] uh [,] a] decent smile [when] [they] [are] fifteen , sixteen years old . 
B|94| M: Uh-uh . [Right .] [Right ,] uh-hue . 
A|95| A: [I] [know ,] two [of] my daughters [had to have] [that] [and] [they] started having extractions at age eight [, uh ,] [because] [they] [just] [had] [too] many teeth [for] their size mouth . 
B|96| M: [Oh .] 
A|97| A: [And] [we] footed [the] bill , [because] [there] _was not_ any such thing [and] [when] [they] were young . 
B|98| M: [Right .] 
A|99| A: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
B|100| M: [So] [he] needed [a] dentist [to] pull him _up_ [. And] [the] orthodony [was not] good . He needed [a] [, uh] [a] private orthopedist [to] pull [the] [dental] away [from] him . 
A|101| A: [Uh-huh] , major . 
B|102| M: [and , uh] . 
A|103| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|104| M: _Well [, I_ guess] I'll [let] him [go] . 
A|105| A: [Well , I] tell [you] [I [,] I] [just] read an article [in the] paper [about] what [they] [are doing] [, I think] [it] [was] an ad [in] [, in] our publication at Texas Instruments , where [they] [are] breaking [the] jaw [and , and] lining [the] jaw [up] [with] [the] teeth . 
B|106| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|107| A: It's , [it's] less painful [and] less [expensive] . 
B|108| M: Uh-oh [, that's] good . 
A|109| A: [Yeah .] 
B|110| M: [Well [,] that's] good . 
A|111| A: [I [,] I] [know [,] but] [it ,] [it's ,] [it's [,] uh ,] easier on [the] patient [in the] long run , which amazed me .
