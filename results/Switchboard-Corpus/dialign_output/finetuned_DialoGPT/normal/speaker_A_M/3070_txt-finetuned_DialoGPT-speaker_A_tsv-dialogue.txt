A|34| A: _Right ._ 
B|35| M: [And] _, uh ,_ _they_ [do] _a lot_ [of] fishing _there_ . 
A|36| A: _Okay_ _, so_ [this] _town hall_ [that] [you] [meet [in] _,] is_ [that] _like [a_ ,] um , 
B|37| M: [Well [,] it's not] [a] [town hall] _, it_ _, it_ [it's just] [a _,] it_ has [like] two rooms _, _and ,_ uh_ _the one_ room [is] [like a] _big_ _, it_ only has _one_ door _, and _then_ the_ other door [is] open _, so you_ can [just] _go_ _out_ _there_ _and , you know ,_ enjoy [the] quiet _of the_ room .

B|49| M: _Yeah_ _, [and ,_ uh] . 
A|50| A: _Right ._ 
B|51| M: _and _so_ that's_ why [we] [have] [, uh [,] a] variety . 
A|52| A: [Do] [they] always [have] _the [,_ [the] one] person _in the_ [family] who knows , [or] _everyone_ thinks [they] [know] how [to] make [this] [the] best [, [so] that's] _what_ [they] [get] [to] cook . 
B|53| M: [Right] , uh-huh . 
A|54| A: _Well [, that's_ good .] [Well [,] I] _had a_ professor [in] anthropology at school who studied [family] reunions [, so] [I] learned [a lot] _about_ [them] _. I_ haven't , been [to] [a lot] , 
B|55| M: [Oh .] 
A|56| A: but [we] talked [, [a] lot] _about_ _the [,_ the] rituals , 
B|57| M: [Right .] 
A|58| A: [you] [all] equated [the] [family] reunions as , with [the] Protestant . 
B|59| M: [Right .] [Right .] 
A|60| A: _It_ _was the_ Protestant version [of the] Catholic pilgrimage . 
B|61| M: [Oh , that's] _interesting_ . 
A|62| A: _It_ _was_ [, _it] was_ an [interesting] theory . She talked _about_ _the [,_ uh , the] Catholics [all] _, it's a_ home centered [, you know [,] it's] [all] [family] centered anyway [, so you] [usually] [are] living where _your_ parents [live] [and it's] [all] , _your_ [, you] _don't _have_ to_ come home [, so] [the] Catholics would make [a] pilgrimage [in] older Europe , but when [the] Protestant ethic happened [in] America , [there] _were_ _people_ who _ever_ went [out [and] , you know ,] went away _from the_ [family] [to] seek their fortune [, and then] _had to_ come back home _for_ their [reunion] [, so] [that ,] became their version [of the] pilgrimage . 
B|63| M: Huh _. That's_ [interesting] . 
A|64| A: [But] she [had [,] _it] was_ [interesting] [, you _know [,] I_ don't know] how valid _it is_ , but she talked _about_ [that] [and] how _the [,_ the] [big] [picnic] table _was the_ symbolic communion [of the] _people_ gathering [together] [, and ,] um [, you know ,] _about_ [the] bread [and] [the] ritual placement . [Do you] [have [a] , a] certain way [that] everything [is] placed [out] [on] [the] table [every] , [every year] ? Is [there] _kind of [a_ [,] you know ,] salads [go] [first] [and] things [like] [that] ? 
B|65| M: _Yeah_ , yeah . 
A|66| A: [Right .] 
B|67| M: [and , uh] [we] , we're [all] [from] [, uh] [in [the] [,] _you] [,_ I] guess [you're] [from the] Dallas area , 
A|68| A: _Well , that's_ pretty . 
B|69| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|70| A: Sure does [. That's] _wonderful ._ 
B|71| M: [So] [, I] think [it's [, it's] a] [wonderful] _thing_ . 
A|72| A: [Yeah _.] I_ wish we'd , 
B|73| M: We'd [have to] [have] some [kind of a] plan [that] [was] able [to] accommodate [everyone] . 
A|74| A: [Right .] 
B|75| M: [So] he [had to] work until he [was] ready [to] [go] [and [,] _and] so_ he [had [a] lot] [of] time [to] think [about] [what] he wanted [to] [do] . 
A|76| A: [Right .] 
B|77| M:  !!!!!! % !! Remind me .!!!,!! [That's] right !! You !! [I] !! [It] !! [Yeah] !!?!! Did !! [Okay] !! [Well] !! Hi !! _Have you_ [ever] [had [a] [,] uh [,] a] real barbecue ? 
A|78| A: Wow . You're [just] [, uh ,] [Oh , that's] incredible . 
B|79| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that] now . 
A|80| A: [Right .] 
B|81| M: [But] [I] [was] able [to] [, _you] [,_ you] [had to] [have] _, have_ [your] own [people] [, you] weren't able [to] [just] walk around [and] shoot everybody _else_ . 
A|82| A: [Right] 
B|83| M: [And then] _we _had_ , uh_ [uh [,] a] [big] roast [that] _we had_ [for] breakfast . 
A|84| A: [Have [you] [,] have] [you] done [this] repetitively , [or] [just] _once_ ? 
B|85| M: [Yeah] , [once] . 
A|86| A: [Oh .] 
B|87| M: [and] [we] [were] [there] [for a] week [, and] [I] [was] [there] [for] [about] [a] week [and] [a] half [, and] [it was] [wonderful [.] I] mean [, it] [, [it] is] [a] beautiful country . 
A|88| A: See [, that's] we've [we [had] _a] problem_ with [that] . 
B|89| M: [I don't [know] , I] guess [, I [don't] [have] [a] _problem] [._ I] [, I] [just] think [that [,] uh] [you know] . 
A|90| A: [Oh .] 
B|91| M: [And] [they're] still [, you] still can't [get] around . 
A|92| A: [Right [.] That's] [our] , [was] [our] [problem .] We [had [, uh] , [the] first] [reunion] , [or] [the first] [, you know ,] major [reunion] [was] probably six [or] seven years ago . 
B|93| M: Uh-huh . 
A|94| A: [And [then] the] second [reunion] , [people] who maybe [, you know ,] [had] sacrificed things [to] come [to [the] first one] thought , oh [, well [, it's] not] [that] [big] [a] [thing] [this] [year] , 
B|95| M: Uh . 
A|96| A: [and so] [it] [kind of] wound down , 
B|97| M: [Well , that's] , [that] [was the] only bad experience [I] [ever] [had] . 
A|98| A: [and then] finally [, you know ,] [you're] lucky [to] [get] [, you know [,] you] [get] [the] Shreveport relatives [there] , but no [one] [else] [so] [that ,] 
B|99| M: [Right .]
