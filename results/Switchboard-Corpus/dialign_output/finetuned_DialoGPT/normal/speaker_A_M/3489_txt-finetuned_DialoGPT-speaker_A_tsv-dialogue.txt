A|43| A: No . 
B|44| M: [I] don't [, I] donno what _the_ solution is [to] [that .] 
A|45| A: [Well ,] great . That's excellent . 
B|46| M: Yeah . 
A|47| A: [Well [,] uh ,] if [a lot of] people _did _that_ ,_ [then] _we_ wouldn't [have] [a lot _of] this_ junk mail . That's [a] great idea _. I_ hadn't thought [about] [that] [and] _we_ might _be able to_ incorporate [some] [of] [that .] One thing ,

A|51| A: Uh-huh . 
B|52| M: And [, uh] . 
A|53| A: Right . 
B|54| M: And [, uh] .
