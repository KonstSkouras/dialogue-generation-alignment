B|0| M: Uh . 
A|1| A: and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school _is_ just totally different . 
B|2| M: _Oh ,_ [is] it ? 
A|3| A: You _know ,_ _you_ just , _you_ did not see _, I_ did not see anybody in my classrooms , when _I_ was going to school , act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom . 
B|4| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: _Yeah _,_ that's_ right _, that's_ right . 
B|6| M: _but , um ,_ 
A|7| A: My , my daughter's in the [, um ,] fourth grade 
B|8| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|9| A: and [, um ,] there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt the classroom , where the teacher cannot teach 
B|10| M: Uh _, uh_ . 
A|11| A: and when _I_ went to school that just wasn't put up with . 
B|12| M: Uh _, yeah_ . 
A|13| A: [Uh-huh .] _Well ,_ they , they just don't do that any more . 
B|14| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|15| A: But the school system's afraid of getting sued and [, um ,] all sorts of lawsuits I'm sure because of things like that . 
B|16| M: [Yeah _,] yeah_ . 
A|17| A: And _, I_ also believe we don't , even though _I_ feel like _I_ pay a _good_ share towards the school system , that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards put in toward public school . 
B|18| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|19| A: And [, um _,] I_ think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . 
B|20| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|21| A: Yes supposedly _that's_ what it's suppose to go for , and _you_ _know ,_ we'll just have to wait and see whether _that's_ approved or not . 
B|22| M: [Well [,] that's] [good] . 
A|23| A: You _know _,_ I_ don't _know_ your feelings toward that . _I_ guess we shouldn't get into that [but , um ,] and what else [, um _,] I_ think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire . 
B|24| M: [Well [,] _I] [know_ [,] um] . 
A|25| A: [I] have heard stories [, uh] , from other parents that [I know] of , their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs , 
B|26| M: Uh , 
A|27| A: [Oh [,] yeah] , 
B|28| M: [I] mean , 
A|29| A: I've , I've heard some horrible , horrible stories about high , high school teachers 
B|30| M: Uh , 
A|31| A: and , _you_ [know ,] to be , be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school . 
B|32| M: Uh , uh-hue . 
A|33| A: Um [, that's] basically about all that [I know] that may be wrong with the school system . [I] think , with what they have to work with [, I] think they're doing a pretty [good] job right now . 
B|34| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|35| A: [Uh-huh] , so . 
B|36| M: So , 
A|37| A: [Yeah ,] okay , so this [is] probably a real hard subject for _you ._ 
B|38| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|39| A: [Yeah _.] Okay_ , well [, I] guess [, um ,] we can discontinue our call now . 
B|40| M: [Okay] . 
A|41| A: It was a joy in talking with _you ._
