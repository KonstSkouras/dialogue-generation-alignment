A|1| A: There's [, uh ,] maybe some short-term things [that] _they_ can _do_ [and it] hurts everybody's pocket , _of_ course , but _, um , I_ [know] [that] state has [, uh ,] cutback [, uh ,] raises for [a] year _to_ help [, uh [, the] [, uh] ,] state financial or whatever [you] might want _to_ say _to_ get better _in_ [a] better condition . 
B|2| M: Uh-uh . Right . 
A|3| A: That , 
B|4| M: It's _, _it's_ a_ _, it was_ [a] _big_ thing _when_ [, uh , the] oil companies _were_ _talking_ _about_ [, uh] _you know ,_ putting [the [,] the] barrel age [in] metric _, you _know_ ._ 
A|5| A: _Uh ,_ State _of_ _Minnesota_ . 
B|6| M: [Minnesota] _, okay_ . 
A|7| A: So there's [the] potential [that] perhaps [, you know [,] the] U S budget might want _to_ take [a] look at [it's] [, uh ,] federal employees or [, and] take [a] look at saying , well , let's freeze wages . _I mean_ everybody's doing [it] so [it] isn't like [, uh ,] private business has had _to_ _do_ [it] 
B|8| M: [Uh] . 
A|9| A: so [it] might have _to_ be something [that] _they_ might consider doing as [a] _that's_ got _to_ be very short term . 
B|10| M: Right . 
A|11| A: [And] [the] only other avenue [that] [I] can [think] _of_ [is] [, uh ,] looking at where _they're_ spending [the] money [and] [not] so much as saying , well , _we're_ spending [too] much [in] [that] area as perhaps looking at _what_ [is] costing them [the] money . As for , for instance _, I think_ [you] _probably_ remember [the] military getting caught _, um ,_ with toilet seats [that] cost them four hundred , five hundred dollars . 
B|12| M: [Uh ,] right . 
A|13| A: [And] [it was] [just] _, _I_ mean_ [you] can go _to_ K-Mart [and] buy them for [, uh ,] eight dollars or [I think] six dollars or whatever for toilet seats , 
B|14| M: Right , right . 
A|15| A: so . So [it] gives [you] idea [that ,] 
B|16| M: Well [, I] [, I] guess [we're] _going to_ talk _about_ [, uh] [what] [do] _you think about_ [the] school system [in] [the] United States ? 
A|17| A: Sure , sure . So , 
B|18| M: [I mean] , 
A|19| A: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|20| M: But [, um] . 
A|21| A: Than we [think] . Sure . Sure . 
B|22| M: But [, uh] . 
A|23| A: Uh-huh . It sure _is ._ The [, you know ,] as far as _, I think_ there [was] something with [the] [government] official [that] went on conferences for two days [and] actually [, uh , the] conferences [were] nothing but [, uh [,] you know ,] _they're_ getting paid for this [, [and] [it] was] something more than [just] [the] conferences . They [were] using [it] as eating out [, uh ,] [when] [you think about] people [, uh ,] taking vacations these [big] [government] officials taking descendants [in] congress . 
B|24| M: Oh , yeah . 
A|25| A: The rest _of_ them taking these vacations [and] using [the] taxpayers' money for [that] . 
B|26| M: Right . Right . 
A|27| A: [And] [it's a] real [big] crunch [, uh] 
B|28| M: Right , right . 
A|29| A: _of_ course , [when] _they_ get caught then _they're_ [, you know ,] _they're_ guilty _of_ course , but [, uh ,] during [that] time _I'm_ sure there's hundreds _of_ [, uh ,] thousands _of_ people [that] are [, uh ,] spending money [that] does [not] belong [to] them . So , 
B|30| M: Yeah , [that's] true . 
A|31| A: Uh-huh . 
B|32| M: [and] [I think] [they're] right , [that [,] uh] [that ,] [that] _a lot of_ times [they] [do] throw [in] [the] towel [the] wrong way . 
A|33| A: Sure . 
B|34| M: Um [, I] guess [I'm] [a] little _bit_ [too] , uh-hated [about] [the , uh] [the [,] the [,] um , I] [, _I] don't [know_ [,] _I] don't_ really [know] [what] [the] solution [to] [that] [is .] 
A|35| A: Uh-huh . Exactly . [And [I] don't] [think [,] uh [,] it's] ended up being [, [I] mean] [it] gave people jobs 
B|36| M: Yeah . 
A|37| A: but [I think] [it] also cost [, um ,] quite [a] [bit] as far as [because] after [they're] done with [the] war , [a lot of] things [were] no longer put [to] use . [I mean] [it was] kind [of] like [, okay] , we'll [do] this during this point [and] time but after [that] [that's] [, you know [,] uh] [they] didn't want [to] [do] [it] anymore . 
B|38| M: Right . 
A|39| A: So , [a lot of] things [that] are saying [that] [they're] no longer [going to] be doing for next wars [that] are coming up [that] [they] did for this one [in] getting rid [of] [a lot of] things . So [I don't [know] .] 
B|40| M: Yeah [, I think] [they're] [probably] right . 
A|41| A: Okay , well [, it was] good [talking] [to] [you] [and] have [a] good evening . 
B|42| M: Well [, you] [too] .
