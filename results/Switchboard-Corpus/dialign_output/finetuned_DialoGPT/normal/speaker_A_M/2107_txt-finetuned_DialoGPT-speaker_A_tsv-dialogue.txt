A|1| A: [I] haven't _had_ [my] oldest _one_ quite nine years _, I've_ _had_ him probably five years . 
B|2| M: _Yeah , _I_ think_ _that's_ _the_ _way_ _it_ _is_ . 
A|3| A: _Oh_ yes _, I love_ [my] _cats [._ I] lost _one_ _, one_ time [, uh ,] 
B|4| M: _Oh ._ 
A|5| A: [the] first _one_ [I] got . _He_ jumped off [the] balcony actually , _of_ [a] second story apartment . 
B|6| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|7| A: [And] he'd _never_ _been_ outside , _like , you know ,_ _by_ _himself_ outside . 
B|8| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|9| A: [And] [it] started raining _and I_ _was_ hysterical [. I] _was_ [, I] _was_ [, _I] mean _,_ you_ _would_ [have] thought [a] child _had_ died . 
B|10| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|11| A: [I] called everyone [I] knew [, I] _had_ every friend [I] knew _in the_ apartment searching _for_ _this_ _cat_ . 
B|12| M: _Oh ._ 
A|13| A: [And] _they_ laughed _at _me_ _,_ they_ thought _that_ _was_ _so_ hysterical . 
B|14| M: _Oh _,_ that's_ _great_ . 
A|15| A: [Oh] _yeah ._ 
B|16| M: [and I] _, I just_ _can't_ stand _it ._ 
A|17| A: The _cat_ _was_ here first _so_ _I _know ,_ it's_ hard . 
B|18| M: _Yeah , [I_ know] . 
A|19| A: [Oh ,] _how_ funny . 
B|20| M: _So_ _, we_ sleep _a lot_ _, but_ [it's] [a] _good_ _thing_ [that] _there_ isn't _any_ . 
A|21| A: _That's_ sweet [, I] [have] [the] _two _,_ the_ _other_ _two cats_ [I] [have] [are] outdoor _cats ._ 
B|22| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|23| A: [And] _they_ didn't used _to be_ actually _, but they_ got kind _of_ wild [and] weren't doing [very] _well_ _inside _,_ so_ [I] put _them_ outside once [I] got [a] house [and] [they're] doing [great] [out] [there] _, they_ _love_ [it .] _But_ [the] _other_ _one_ _, the_ first _one_ [I] got _he_ _doesn't want_ anything _to do_ _with_ outside unless _you're_ [there] . 
B|24| M: _Yeah ,_ [well] [, you [know ,] _it's] [like_ [,] uh ,] _it was_ [like ,] _it ,_ it'll kill [me ,] [you're] _right_ [, but] then _when_ [you] _get_ [inside ,] [it] will jump _up and_ [do] _something_ [, you] _don't_ [know] . 
A|25| A: Other than [that] _he_ gets scared _to_ death . If [you] shut [that] door _he goes_ _into_ hiding . 
B|26| M: Uh-hue . 
A|27| A: _I think it's_ from [the] time _he_ jumped off [the] balcony 
B|28| M: _Oh ._ 
A|29| A: [And] Lord knows _what_ happened _to_ him . He's probably _been_ through [all] kinds _of_ nightmares . 
B|30| M: Uh-hugs . 
A|31| A: Probably . 
B|32| M: _You_ [know , it's] , _it ,_ _it was_ [a] , [it] _really_ [was] [a] scary movie [. [I] mean [,] I] [, _I] don't_ [know] [how] [they] could kill [that] _many_ _people_ [in] [that] movie . 
A|33| A: Are [they] . 
B|34| M: _Yeah ,_ one's [a] _, a_ girl _and the_ other's [a] boy _, so ._ 
A|35| A: [Oh] no . 
B|36| M: [And] [so] _we_ _had to_ start _all over_ . We _had _to_ get_ _a dog_ _, _a_ lot_ [of] work . 
A|37| A: [Oh] [my] _gosh ._ 
B|38| M: _So_ , 
A|39| A: _Oh , I_ imagine . 
B|40| M: [He] _, he_ _really_ _is_ . 
A|41| A: [I] wonder [how] [many] [of] his _lives_ [he] missed , [when] [that] happened . 
B|42| M: _Well _,_ he_ [lives] [in] [like] [a] woods [, _it's] like_ [a] _, a_ farm _, _and_ [he_ goes] [to] [like] [two] _or_ three _weeks_ _a year_ . 
A|43| A: _Oh , I_ _can_ imagine , _what_ did [he] _shoot_ him _with_ . 
B|44| M: _Well _,_ he_ shot [himself] [in the] foot _, _and_ he_ fell [into] [the] trap . 
A|45| A: [Oh] [my] _gosh ._ People [are] _crazy ._ 
B|46| M: _Yeah _,_ [yeah_ .] 
A|47| A: [Oh] Lord . 
B|48| M: [He] [was] _just _,_ _he_ was_ _just_ _about_ ready [to] _go_ _. _And_ I_ [, I] _said ,_ [well] [you know] I'm going [to] wait [and] _see_ [what] _happens_ _. _And_ _he_ , he_ went [in] [and] looked [at me] [like ,] [you're] [crazy _.] And_ [, uh] [I] _said_ _I don't_ [want] [to] [shoot] [my] _dog_ . 
A|49| A: [Oh] man . 
B|50| M: [and] _he's_ still kicking _around ._ 
A|51| A: [I] imagine [. They] usually [are] after [something] [like] [that] [happens] [to] _them ._ It seems [to] mellow _them_ [or] [something] . 
B|52| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|53| A: No . 
B|54| M: We [have] [two _cats] . And_ [, uh] 
A|55| A: [Oh] _yeah , I_ [I] keep _talking_ [about] getting rid [of] [my] outdoor [cats] because [I] feel [like] [I don't] _, I can't_ _take_ care [of] _them_ as [well] because [they're] outside , 
B|56| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|57| A: [and] [it] worries [me] [that] _one_ day _one_ [of] _them_ won't come back , 
B|58| M: _Yeah , [I_ know ,] 
A|59| A: [and I] feel [like] [they] need [a] big home [, a] nice place where someone _can_ [have] [the] time [to] play _with_ _them_ [and] _things ._ _But_ _I can't_ give _them_ [up] . 
B|60| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|61| A: [I [just] [,] I] [go] hysterical [when] [they] [don't] come home . 
B|62| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|63| A: [Oh ,] oh _yeah [,_ and] every time [you] [see] _one_ hit [on the] side [of] [the] road [you] say _is that_ [my] _cat_ . 
B|64| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|65| A: [And] [you] [go] [crazy] thinking [it] might _be_ yours . 
B|66| M: [That's] _right ._ 
A|67| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|68| M: [He] [was] [just] [like , you _know [,] I_ can't] [do] [this] [, I] [want] [to do] [this] . 
A|69| A: Ugh ! 
B|70| M: _and , uh_ . 
A|71| A: Really . 
B|72| M: [I don't] [know [,] but] [I think it's] pretty . 
A|73| A: _It's_ here now _, we _have_ to_ keep [it .] [Yeah [,] my] [, my] first _one_ [that] [I] got [, I] [had] [just] moved away from home [and] got [my] own apartment . It took [me] [about] [two] [weeks] [to] realize _, that_ [was] real lonely . 
B|74| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|75| A: [So] [I] found [this] _one_ [and [, uh] ,] actually [it was] [on] [a] sign [at] Taco Bell drive-thru [that] [said] free kittens . 
B|76| M: [Oh , [I] know] . 
A|77| A: [And I] thought [well] [that's] interesting , I'll call _them ._ 
B|78| M: [Yeah _,] that's_ [, that] [, _that] would be_ _good_ . 
A|79| A: [And [he] was] [the] only _one_ left [and] his mother [had] _been_ killed coming back across [the] road [to] make sure she'd gotten [all] _her_ kittens . 
B|80| M: Uh-hauh . 
A|81| A: [And [he] was] [the] last _one_ _she_ carried across _, you know , the_ whole big _sad_ story . 
B|82| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|83| A: [So] [of] course [, I] [had to] _take_ him [. I] felt [so] sorry _for_ him after [that] . 
B|84| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|85| A: [And he] [is] [, uh _,] you can tell_ [he was] weaned _too_ young because he'll nurse [on] your ears [and] your fingers . 
B|86| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|87| A: [Yeah [,] [he] [,] I] asked [the] vet why [he] did [that] [and he] [said] [he was] probably weaned _too_ young , which [he was] , because his mom [was] killed [, so .] 
B|88| M: _Well _,_ that's_ [sad] . 
A|89| A: _But_ [he] [is] [the] lovingest _cat_ . Everybody , [people] who [don't] even [like] _cats ,_ [like] him . 
B|90| M: [He] [is] . 
A|91| A: [He] _never_ meows [, [he] , he] _doesn't_ [have] [any] front claws [, I] [had] him declawed , 
B|92| M: [Oh ,] _really_ ? 
A|93| A: [but] [he] _doesn't_ bite anybody [he's] [just ,] [he's] [just] kind [of] [there] , real friendly [and] docile . 
B|94| M: Uh-hau . 
A|95| A: [Oh] _yeah _,_ yeah [,_ we] _do [,_ we] call [that] doing biscuits , 
B|96| M: Uh-hum . 
A|97| A: "it looks [like] _their_ kneading bread *spelling ""their"" should [be] ""they're""" 
B|98| M: [Oh [,] my] . 
A|99| A: [Oh [, I] just] _love_ [cats [.] _I] like_ dogs _, they're_ okay [, I] [had] [, I] [had] [a dog] [when] [I] lived [at] home 
B|100| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|101| A: [but] _they're a lot_ more trouble than [cats] actually . 
B|102| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|103| A: [Oh] _yeah _,_ _they_ do_ . 
B|104| M: [I don't] [know] [how] [they do] _it [,_ but [they] [do] [,] uh ,] 
A|105| A: [Oh] [they] [are] [. _I] love_ [it [,] it's] [so] funny [to get] more than _one_ _cat_ together , because [it] brings [out] _their_ personalities .
