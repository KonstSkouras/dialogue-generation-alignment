B|42| M: [Yeah] _, yeah_ . 
A|43| A: [and] [the] other cities [it] wasn't nearly as bad [and] [a] couple [of] [them] [it] _was_ , what [we] did _in_ _some_ _of the_ other cities [and they] tell [you] [to] [do that] _is_ [to] hire [a] local guide 
B|44| M: [Uh] . 
A|45| A: [it] doesn't matter who _it is_ [and they] keep everyone else away from [you] . 
B|46| M: _Right ._ 
A|47| A: [And] it's worth [it] [and] it's [like] ten dollars [a] day [or] something [and] its worth [it] _just_ [to] keep everyone else away from badgering [you] 
B|48| M: [Uh] . Uh-hum . 
A|49| A: _and you_ feel stupid doing [that] [but] [we] did [it] , 
B|50| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|51| A: [and we] _were_ much happier , 
B|52| M: [Yeah .] 
A|53| A: _and you_ also _get_ _in_ [to] see [things] [that] [you] might _not_ _get_ [into] [if] [you] _were_ alone [, uh ,] 
B|54| M: _Right ._ 
A|55| A: [Uh]

B|60| M: [Oh _,] really_ ? 
A|61| A: [Uh ,] we're going [to go] _for_ [a] conference _in_ September [and] so , hopefully , we'll _get_ [to] travel _a little bit_ too . 
B|62| M: [Oh , that's] nice . 
A|63| A: [Uh ,] my more exciting spots [have] [been] [, I've been [to] the] Galapagos Islands . 
B|64| M: [Oh _, that's] [,_ that] sounds neat . 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh] [, _that] was_ one _of the_ most _wonderful_ vacations [I've] ever [had] . 
B|66| M: [Oh _, that's] [,_ that] sounds [wonderful] . 
A|67| A: [Yes] . [If] [you] [like] wildlife , it's [a] fabulous vacation . 
B|68| M: _Oh , I_ love _it ._ 
A|69| A: [If] _you don't_ [like] wildlife it's probably _not_ [of] interest [But] [it] [, _that] was_ [really] [, really] fabulous [and] _just_ [the] photos [I] [have] [of] [it] [and] gosh , incredible [and] be so close , 
B|70| M: [Uh] . 
A|71| A: [Um] , August , eighty-eight . 
B|72| M: [Oh _, that's] [,_ that] sounds , 
A|73| A: [And then ,] _actually_ , after [there] [I went to] um , Hawaii , [a lot of] my travel has [been] sort [of] based around conferences [or] business meetings 
B|74| M: [Uh ,] uh-hau [, uh ,] 
A|75| A: [and] so [, I went to] Hawaii [and then to] Australia [and] Japan [and] China , 
B|76| M: [Oh ,] how nice . 
A|77| A: [I] [, I] , _actually_ [I] didn't [go] diving . 
B|78| M: [Oh ,] uh-hoh . 
A|79| A: [I] _, I'm_ [a] diver [and] so [, that's [,] that's] _actually_ [been] another [of] my favorite vacations has [been] taking _little_ diving trips 
B|80| M: [Uh ,] uh-hoh . 
A|81| A: [but [, uh] ,] no [I] didn't _get_ [to the] [Great] Barrier Reef _. I_ drove from Sidney down [to] Melbourne [and] [over to] Adelaide . 
B|82| M: [Oh _,] yeah_ . 
A|83| A: It's gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . [The] coastline _was just_ incredible . It's huge . 
B|84| M: _Oh , I_ bet [it is] . 
A|85| A: Australia . [Yeah .] 
B|86| M: [Yeah .] 
A|87| A: [Uh ,] [but ,] 
B|88| M: _I think _,_ uh , in_ _this_ area [, we] _have a_ good reputation [for] [, uh] 
A|89| A: _I don't_ remember [if] [I had] _shrimp_ . 
B|90| M: [No [,] [you] don't] [have] [to] [have] [, _you] have_ [to get] [a] special permission . 
A|91| A: _I don't_ [think] so . 
B|92| M: [Oh [,] I'm] [not] sure [. [I] don't] [, I] don _, I think_ [we had] [some] [. [We] had] [some] [, uh ,] [shrimp] [that [was] just] [, uh] . 
A|93| A: [Oh , I] [like that] too . [But] [, uh , in] fact [I] didn't eat _out_ [that] much [there] [because] [I] [was] traveling by myself [in] [a] car , [it] [would] [have] [been] [, [I think] ,] much more fun [to] [do] [it] [like] [in] [the] van , _with_ [a] bunch [of] people . 
B|94| M:  !!! % !! ; !! Remind [me] [of] [that] . 
A|95| A: [But] [, uh ,] 
B|96| M: Well [, I don't] [know [,] uh] . 
A|97| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [And] [we had] [a little bit] _of a_ contest [. We] [went] _up_ _to a_ [, uh] [a] reserve lake _up_ near Big Bend [and we] _took a_ picture [of [the] [,] uh] [of the] log cabins [and] [of] course [the] log log cabINS [and] [of] Big Bend . 
A|99| A: [And I] [was] by myself [in] China too . 
B|100| M: [Oh] . 
A|101| A: [Yeah .] 
B|102| M: Wow . 
A|103| A: China [was] [a little bit] more [, uh ,] [of a] challenge . [But] , [it] , [it] wasn't more [of a] challenge [in] [a] sense [because] [I] hired [a] guide all [the] time , 
B|104| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [and] so [I] never [, [you] [know] ,] got _out_ by myself , [or] [not] much , 
B|106| M: [Yeah .] Uh-hue . 
A|107| A: [No ,] _actually_ [I] paid about either [a] thousand dollars [or] [a little bit] , no maybe [it] [was] about [a] thousand dollars , maybe [a little bit] less [, I don't] [really] remember , [for] ten days including all my meals , [a] guide , [a] car [, the] airfare [and ,] [but] [this] [is] from Hong Kong , 
B|108| M: [Oh [,] really] . 
A|109| A: [because] [I] [was] already [in] Hong Kong [and ,] um , [but] [it] only cost [you] about [a] thousand dollars [to go] [there] [and] [I went to] Beijing , Shanghai , Chengdu [and] _actually_ [then] [I] [took a] train [up] from Shanghai [to [a] little] , Quingdao [I think] [is] [the] name [of] [it .] It's [a little] [, uh ,] sort [of] getaway retreat village [not] far from Shanghai . It's [just] [a] train ride . 
B|110| M: [Oh [,] really] . 
A|111| A: [And] [that [,] [I] had] [two] internal , one _, yeah ,_ [two] internal plane flights [and] [a] couple [of] other [things] . [It] [was] [really] , 
B|112| M: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
A|113| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: [Oh , that's] great . 
A|115| A: Around [a] thousand . 
B|116| M: [Yeah] [, well] [, that's] [pretty] good [actually] . 
A|117| A: [Oh ,] Japan's ridiculous . 
B|118| M: [Yeah .] 
A|119| A: [And I] stayed [, I] didn't stay [in] [the] top [of the] line hotels [but] [I] stayed [in] , [they] _were_ all completely clean , 
B|120| M: [Yeah] [, yeah] . 
A|121| A: [and [,] [you] [know] ,] [they] _were_ newly built [and they] _were_ sort [of the] lower end [of the] top [of the] line , hotels , [because] [they] said [you can't] stay [in] [the] cheap stuff . 
B|122| M: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
A|123| A: [Right .] [Right .] 
B|124| M:  !!!!,!! eston !! [Yeah] !! [We] [were] [just] [out] [there] [with] [, uh [,] uh] [a] ball . 
A|125| A: [Uh ,] [but] _yeah [,_ [that] was] [, I] highly recommend [that] [way] [to go] . [If] you're ever interested [in] going [the] route [, I] dealt [with] [this] woman , her name [was] Rita at China Tours [in] Boston 
B|126| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|127| A: [Yeah .] [Uh [,] and] [a] friend [of] mine who [had] gone [for] [a] business trip [to] China [and] she [just] gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and] [it] [would] [really] be fun [, I think] ideally [with] [like] [two] couples [because] [you have a] car [and] [a] driver [and] [a] guide 
B|128| M: [Oh [,] yeah [,] yeah]
