A|19| A: [and] _then_ _we_ put [that] on [the] computer [and] _then_ _we_ took about three months [and _, uh] [,_ and] adjusted , where _we_ could come down [and] where _we_ didn't _want to_ come down , 
B|20| M: Yeah . 
A|21| A: _and we_ _really_ _, uh ,_ lessened _it _,_ uh ,_ our living expenses _, uh ,_ more than what _we_ thought _we_ _would_ . 
B|22| M: Yeah . 
A|23| A: _But_ , 
B|24| M: _I think_ _, I think that's_ [really] _important_ ,

A|43| A: [Well [, I] think that's] [important] for [your] budget [to] be for [it] [to] _work_ though [, you] [have] _to do something_ . 
B|44| M: Right . 
A|45| A: Of course _not_ . 
B|46| M: [but] ,

B|52| M: Right . 
A|53| A: Yes . 
B|54| M: [and [we] both] [know] [that] [that's] [not] [going to] happen .

B|56| M: _I know_ . 
A|57| A: Yes . 
B|58| M: [And] _you _don't_ [want_ to] _over_ [do] [it [,] you] [want [to] make] [it] [a] habit . 
A|59| A: Exactly , although _so_ _much_ per month anyway . 
B|60| M: Right _, right_ . 
A|61| A: [And , uh ,] [that] [really] should be [in] [your] [but] if [you don't] spend [it , it] should be [in] [your] bank account at [the] end [of] [the] month 
B|62| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|63| A: [Oh ,] no , no , no , no . 
B|64| M: [so] [we're] [not] allowed [to] add any deductions [, and] [we're] even [going to] try [to] , [to] add [some] [in _the] , the_ interest . 
A|65| A: _You_ [don't want] [the] government [to] spend [your] _money_ . _You_ [want to] be _able_ , 
B|66| M: No [, I think] [that [,] I] [, I] agree with [you] [, I] [would] [much] rather [have] [the] [money] [to do something] like [that] .

A|71| A: [Uh [,] and] if [, and] if _that's the_ only _way_ [that] will [, it] will [make] [you] save [and] [have a] little nest egg at [the] end [of] [the , the] year [then] doggone [it] [that's] what [you] should [do] . 
B|72| M: That's _right_ . 
A|73| A: [Uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] [Well , I] [was] [just] reading [an] article [in [, uh] [,] a] North Carolina paper today where [a] high school [student] obtained [over] _two_ hundred thousand dollars worth [of] scholarships for herself by sitting up at night [and] typing at [, uh ,] letters [of] applications [to] universities .
