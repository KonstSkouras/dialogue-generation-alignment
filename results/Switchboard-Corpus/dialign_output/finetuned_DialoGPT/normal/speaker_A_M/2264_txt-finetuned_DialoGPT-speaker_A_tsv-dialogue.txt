A|5| A: [Oh ,] God . 
B|6| M: They're , _they're_ _really_ trying _to_ , trying _to_ start _that_ trend . 
A|7| A: [Oh] . That's [really] nice [to] _know ,_ _because_ _we_ _were_ doing [the] same thing . Because [to] take _it_ [to a] Metco , _you_ [have] [to] take _it_ when [they're] open , _you_ _know ,_ which _is_ always _a real_ pain .

B|10| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|11| A: That's [really] nice [to] find out [that] [it's] behind [there] _Well _,_ we_ pretty much _do_ [, um ,] plastic milk cartons [and [,] um [,] um [,] um ,] newspapers . [I] couldn't even [think] _of_ what _you_ call [them] . 
B|12| M: _Oh , really_ ? 
A|13| A: Plastic milk cartons , newspapers [and] cans [, and] glass [, _I] guess_ , _is_ [the] four , _is really_ [the] four things [that] _we_ _do ._ 
B|14| M: Uh-huh . 
A|15| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|16| M: [I guess] we've _got_ [to] wait _a little_ bit .

A|23| A: [I] _know ._ [I] _know ._ We're kind _of_ [the] same way . You [know ,] at first , _you_ [know ,] _you_ , at first [it] _was_ _a real_ [, it] _was_ _a real_ hassle [, and] I'm wondering are [we] [really] going [to] _do_ this , but _you_ kind _of_ get [, [I] guess] , into [a little] routine , _you_ [know ,] where [it] becomes , _is_ automatic , now [, to] throw , [different] things in [different] places , 
B|24| M: Uh-huh . 
A|25| A: _you_ _know ._ So [I just] go , _you_ [know [,] we have] [a] pretty _good_ size pantry in our kitchen [and] [I've] [just] [got] three trash cans sitting in [there ,] _you_ [know [,] we] [just] kind _of_ dump things in each [one ,] if , _you_ [know ,] if [we] get [them ,] 
B|26| M: Uh-huh . 
A|27| A: [so .] 
B|28| M: _Well , I_ [think] [that's really] important . 
A|29| A: [Oh [,] they] _do_ , _too ._ _And_ [they're] impossible [to] crush . _I mean ,_ _you_ can't get [the] _down_ [to] any size , _you_ _know ._ If _you_ get four milk cartons [and] [that] fills up trash bag , _you_ [know] pretty easily , [so .] You [know ,] 
B|30| M: _Well , I_ don't [know .] 
A|31| A: [Oh , really] . 
B|32| M: [Yeah] [, and] [I] [, [and] [,] and] [it's] , [it's] been [a real] problem _for_ me . 
A|33| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|34| M: _And _,_ uh [,_ they] [were] [real] convenient _and , uh_ .

B|36| M: [so .] 
A|37| A: Sure . Let somebody get something out _of_ [it] . 
B|38| M: [Yeah] _, yeah_ , [it's] [a real] [good] idea . 
A|39| A: [Yeah] 
B|40| M: [I mean [,] that's] [just] [, [that] , that] [just] isn't right . 
A|41| A: Ha-ha [Well , I] _was_ kind _of_ hoping with , _you_ [know ,] _do_ _you_ work [for] T [I] ? 
B|42| M: [Yeah] [, _I] [do_ .] 
A|43| A: No . [Yeah .] There _was_ [a] , T [I] has [got] this organization called T A D which _is_ T I'ers Against Drugs . [And ,] _you_ [know ,] we're [recycling] aluminum cans up here [and , uh ,] [just] what _you_ would buy out _of_ [the] machines [and] drink here [and] [there] _was_ crushers out in all _of_ [the] hallways _you_ [know [,] and] [that's] [, they] use [the] money from [that] [to] fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program . It's , _you_ [know ,] T [I] doesn't give [them] any money , all , everything _is_ made from [that] . [And] [they] [had] talked [about] having [a] thing like , [one] Saturday [a] month , _you_ could come [and] drop your aluminum cans off from home , _you_ [know ,] 
B|44| M: [Yeah .] 
A|45| A: [And] I'm kind _of_ like [, yeah] . [I] shall [, they] would [do] [that because] at least somebody _was_ getting [the] money out _of_ [it ,] _you_ [know .] That _was_ going [to] use [it] [for] [good] , [so] , 
B|46| M: [Well , I] [think] [that's] [a] [great] idea . 
A|47| A: Sounds like _you_ [have] [a little] [one] [just] like [I do] 
B|48| M: [Yeah] [, [I] [do] .] 
A|49| A: [Yeah .] Mine _was_ two in December 
B|50| M: [Oh ,] my goodness . 
A|51| A: [Well [,] it] _was good_ [to] talk _to you_ . 
B|52| M: _It_ [was good] talking [to you] [too .] 
A|53| A: [Oh ,] [do] [they] [really] . Curbside pick up ? 
B|54| M: [Oh] [yeah] [, [and] , uh ,] [it's] [, [it] [,] it] [is really] weird . They [have] [, uh] [a little] bit [of] [a] strangler [down] [there .] 
A|55| A: [I] [really] hope [they] [do] [that] in Louisville . [It] would make [it] [a] lot easier on all [of] us . Talk [to you] later .
