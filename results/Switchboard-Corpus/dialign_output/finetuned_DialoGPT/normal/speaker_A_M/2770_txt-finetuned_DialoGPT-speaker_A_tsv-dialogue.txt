B|15| M: Uh , yeah , 
A|16| A: It _kind of_ traveled around travel . 
B|17| M: Uh-huh . 
A|18| A: _Yeah_ , _when I_ had [a] Cocker Spaniel [it [, it] was] an outdoor dog [and] _, uh _,_ I think_ [I] liked _that_ better .

B|21| M: [I] mean [, I] mean , _they're_ [, they] [, they] [take] up [so] [much] space in [the] house _, and I ,_ 
A|22| A: _Yeah_ _, that's_ true .

A|26| A: Oh _, that's_ exciting . [Yeah .] 
B|27| M: [so] [I was] [kind of] [looking] [for] [something] [a] little _more_ [, uh ,] challenging , 
A|28| A: [Yeah] _, _I think_ it's_ [really] important _to_ [that , that] if _you_ get [a] _pet_ [that] [they're] either spayed or neutered [so] [that _,] you_ _know ,_ we're not [just] _going_ on _with_ this _pet_ population [and] having _to_ , [just] get rid [of] _them_ .

B|35| M: [I think it's] [a] wonderful [thing ,] _though_ . 
A|36| A: [I think] [that's] [really] true . 
B|37| M: [I [,] I think] [that] [was] [one] [of] [the] things [that [I] [,] I was] [really] interested in [when [I] was] younger , [was] in [pet] raising .

A|40| A: [Yeah] , exactly . 
B|41| M: [So [, I] don't [know] ,] [it's] [, it] seems [like] there's _a lot_ [of] things [that] need [to] [be] done about [, uh ,] recycling . 
A|42| A: Exactly . [I think] our community is [a lot] [more] conscious now [though] too [, and] [, [and] that's] good too . 
B|43| M: Uh-huh . 
A|44| A: [Well [,] I think] [that's] all [I] [have to] say .
