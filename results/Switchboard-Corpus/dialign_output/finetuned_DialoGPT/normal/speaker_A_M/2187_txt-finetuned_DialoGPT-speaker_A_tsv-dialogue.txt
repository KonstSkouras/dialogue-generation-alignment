B|2| M:  !!! ; !! Remind _me_ [of] _that ._ 
A|3| A: _Yeah _,_ the_ cheese fondue _I_ _make_ , _some_ people like swiss , um _, I_ prefer cheddar . _And_ _I'll_ mix _, I_ won't _make_ _, I_ won't _have a_ sharp cheddar _because_ _it ,_ for fondue _I think_ _it_ should be _a_ _little_ calmer than real sharp , cheddar . 
B|4| M: Uh-huh .

B|14| M: Uh-huh . 
A|15| A: What _I've_ been doing _when_ _I_ get invited someplace _and_ bring something _, I_ _make_ _, uh ,_ food kabobs . You take _little_ toothpicks _and_ cut up _, uh ,_ pineapple _and_ strawberry , _and_ even banana if _you_ can _do_ [it] _just_ _before_ _you_ leave . 
B|16| M: _Um_ .

B|22| M: Uh-huh . 
A|23| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|24| M: [it's] [just] _so_ _much_ _work_ . 
A|25| A: [Yeah _,] you_ probably get this , probably pretty sticky after _you_ get done . 
B|26| M: [Yeah] 
A|27| A: Then you've got _to_ drain _the_ water _out_ [of] _the_ watermelon _because_ _, you_ _know ,_ _when_ _you_ scrape _it [,_ it] makes _the_ water . 
B|28| M: [Yeah [.] I] [know [,] uh _,] we_ _used [to_ _do] that_ _with_ _our_ [, uh] _our_ kids , we'd _, we_ _would_ _, we_ did _that_ [to] _our_ trees [when] [they] _were_ [little] [and] we'd [go] through _the , _the_ , uh_ _the ,_ mulch

B|30| M:  !!! Remind [me] [of] _that_ _now_ . 
A|31| A: [Yeah _,] you_ [know ,] if _you_ get _a_ sweet strawberry _they're_ [much] better _, but_ if _you_ get _a_ sour strawberry , 
B|32| M: [Yeah .] 
A|33| A: Huh . [Yeah ,] no , [they] , um [, the] strawberries [are] coming in season [now] from , _they're_ , _they're_ coming up from Florida , [of] course [. I] live in Vermont , [so] . But _they're_ [really] reasonably priced , _they're_ coming up from Florida , [so] . 
B|34| M: [Oh] . 
A|35| A: [Yeah .] 
B|36| M: [but] [they're] [out] [now] , 
A|37| A: [Yeah _,] I think_ [the [, uh] ,] actually _I think_ [they] get , um , _some_ _of them_ from South America . 
B|38| M: Uh-huh . 
A|39| A: Yep , [they] _, a_ lot [of] , um , [of] _a ,_ um , winter produce comes from South America . 
B|40| M: Uh-huh . 
A|41| A: Of course , their seasons [are] switched . 
B|42| M: Uh-huh . 
A|43| A: So , um , [do] _you_ want [to] discuss [the] recipe ? 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! RemindMe !! Auto !! ety !! This [is a] dog [and] cat cross , 
A|45| A: _I have a_ recipe if _you_ want 
B|46| M: _Yeah , that_ sounds _good ._ 
A|47| A: [Um] [, it] filled _, a_ lot [of] people try [to] stay away from this _but I_ _make_ my own homemade pudding [just] _because _I_ don't_ like box pudding . 
B|48| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|49| A: [Yeah , _it] ,_ [and] [it] if _you_ , um , well , first [of] _all_ [I] take about [a] quarter [and] [a] half [of] milk [and] [I] put [it] in [a] two quart saucepan [and] _you_ put [it] on _a really_ low heat . 
B|50| M: Uh-huh . 
A|51| A: _And_ _you_ want [to] use one [of] your [good] sauce pans [that] dissipate [the] heat _because_ _it [,_ it] ends up burning _, I_ mean , no matter how careful _you_ [are] _you_ still might get [a] film on [the] bottom [of] [the] pot . 
B|52| M: [Oh _,] really_ ? 
A|53| A: _I don't_ let [that] worry [me] . _And_ [I] get [the] milk lukewarm [and] then [I] pour about [a] half [a] cup [of] cornstarch in [it] [and] _I have_ this thing [it's] called [the] slender blender [, _it] [,_ it] makes [the [, uh] [,] it] makes [, uh _,] a_ whip topping [out] [of] milk if _you_ get [the] milk cold enough . It's [, uh _,] _I_ don't [know_ ,] [they're] called moo goo leaves or something [they're] 
B|54| M: [Oh ,] [I've] heard [of [them] .] 
A|55| A: [Yeah .] They're real _neat ._ 
B|56| M: [Oh _,] that's_ [neat .] [I've] [never] heard [of] [that] [before] . 
A|57| A: _I think_ [they're] real reasonably priced , _some_ [of them] , [they] [used to] be [a] hundred dollars [and] [they] [used to] whip skim milk into [a] dessert _but I_ didn't get [that] one _, I_ got [the] Black [and] Decker kind . But [, uh _,] it's_ real handy _because_ [it] doesn't _have a_ cord [and] _you_ beat this cornstarch right into [the] [the] milk _, you_ [know ,] [and] [it] does an excellent job , or [just] hand beat _it [._ I] guess _you could_ use [a] hand mixer _but _I_ don't_ _think_ [it] _I don't_ _think_ [it] gets [it] [good] enough . 
B|58| M: [Yeah ,] [I've] _had_ [some [,] [I have] [a] , a] black iron skillet [that] _I [,_ I] bought [it] [because I] _wanted [to_ make] [a] barbecue _, but I_ thought [, _you] just_ can't _make [it_ .] 
A|59| A: _And_ then [before] [the] milk gets [too] hot , um [, I] add two beaten eggs [and] [I] [really] mix [them] in [good .] _And_ then about [a] half [a] cup [of] sugar [and] [I] let [it] pretty [much] [, I] beat [it] like every minute for about ten seconds [and] [it's] [, it] starts thickening , [when] [it] thickens [the] cornstarch might get [a] [little] [, _I] don't [know_ [,] it] gets like [little] globs [of] this rubbery cornstarch , [and] [you just] keep beating [it] in . _And_ [it's] [the , the] trick [is] , [is] [to] [have] this blender , [so] , if [you] [were] , you'd [have] [to] probably almost [go] [out] [and] someone who's [just] going [to [make] it] first time _, it's_ , you'll [have] [much] better luck if [you] [had] one [of] these [little] blenders . _And_ then [you] can add cocoa powder [to] [it] [to make] chocolate or after [it's] thickened [I] cook [it] for [a] [good] , once [it] starts boiling [, I] [just] [, I] cook [it] for [a] [good] seven minutes , seven [to] ten minutes 
B|60| M: [Oh _,] that's_ [good .] 
A|61| A: [and] then [you] can [make] chocolate or [you] can take [it] off [and] let [it] cool [you] put , um [, _really] good_ vanilla favoring in [it] [and] [some] butter [and] [that] makes french vanilla , um , custard . [Yeah ,] 
B|62| M: [Oh _,] that_ sounds [good .] 
A|63| A: A chocolate powder . 
B|64| M: Yes . 
A|65| A: [Yeah , that] cocoa _, yeah_ [, the] unsweetened . It comes in like [a] real dark can , 
B|66| M: [Um] . 
A|67| A: [our] mothers [used to] use [it .] _And_ then , 
B|68| M: [Oh _,] that's_ _great_ . 
A|69| A: [Yeah [,] _we] all [used_ to] , 
B|70| M: [we all used] , 
A|71| A: _yeah_ _, it's_ [the] unsweetened kind _it's not_ like Nestles Quik . 
B|72| M: [Yeah .] 
A|73| A: [I] suppose _you could_ use [that .] 
B|74| M: [Yeah .] 
A|75| A: [Yeah [,] but] , um , 
B|76| M: [I don't know] . 
A|77| A: _Well [,_ I] [used [to] make] [the] regular pudding [, the] chocolate [and] put [it] in [the] pie shell [and] if [it] [would] sit in [the] refrigerator for [a] day , where [you] cut [the] pie [, it] [would] soak into [the] pie shell [and] [it] _was_ like red , [and] I'm like , oh , this [is] kind [of] groedy . 
B|78| M: [I] [know] . 
A|79| A: [Um] , actually [I] found [it] in one [of] my mother's , um , homemade cookbooks [, I] mean , something she [had] collected [out] [of] WOMAN'S DAY or something . 
B|80| M:  !!! % !! _That's_ funny . 
A|81| A: So , 
B|82| M: [Yeah _,] that's_ [, that] [was] [a [really] good] book . 
A|83| A: _I think_ [you] couldn't [make it] [with] [a] hand whisk or , or [a] regular beater [but] , um , 
B|84| M: [Well ,] [I've] [never] tried [it _,] but _I_ would_ imagine [you could] . 
A|85| A: [Yeah [,] but I] still _think_ [a] beater [would] [do] [it] [good] enough , um [, the] trick [is] [to] get [the] cornstarch , 
B|86| M: Uh-huh . 
A|87| A: um _, yeah_ , right in [the ,] in [the] lukewarm milk . Sometimes [I] put [the] cornstarch in [a] separate bowl [and] [I would] put [it] in [the] sink [and] _I'll_ take my lukewarm milk [and] put [it] in [the] cornstarch [and] beat [it] [good .] It seems [to] be better than putting [the , the] cornstarch into [the] liquid [it ,] once [it] hits [the] top [of] [the] liquid [it] seems [to make] [little] balls [and] stuff on [the] top . 
B|88| M: Uh [, I think] _that's_ true . 
A|89| A: [Yeah .] _And_ _I'll_ [do] this [, uh ,] sometimes _I'll_ put my after [I] pour [that] into my , back into my saucepan . _I'll_ put [the] eggs in [the] same dish [and] beat [them] up [and] then pour [the] cornstarch [and] [the] milk mixture in [the] egg . So , 
B|90| M:  !!! [it's not [,] [it's] not] very _thick [,_ but] _it's a_ very _thick_ piece [of] cornstark . 
A|91| A: Yep . _And_ then [, you] [know ,] if [you] can put your cocoa in [with] your cornstarch if [you] [wanted to] . The cocoa even seems [to] thicken [it] even more . 
B|92| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|93| A: Because by [the] vanilla doesn't seem [to] thicken as well as [the ,] sometimes [the] cocoa [is] like , my husband [really] likes [it] [thick] he says [, I] can stick [the] spoon right in this . 
B|94| M: [Yeah .] 
A|95| A: Because I'm always worrying [it] won't firm up [because] [it ,] [when] [you] take [it] [out] [of] [the] saucepan [it's] like , boy [, I] hope this thickens [a] [little] more [because] [it's not] like real package [thick [,] you] [know ,] [when] [you] cook [a] package [, it's] [, [it's] a] [little] less , 
B|96| M: [Yeah .] 
A|97| A: [but I] put [it] in [a] nice glass bowl [and] , um , [some] people [don't] like _that [,_ _that] ,_ film on [the] pudding [so] [you] can put [, uh ,] Saran Wrap over [the] top . 
B|98| M: Uh [, I'll] bet [you] _that's_ [, uh] 
A|99| A: _And_ then once [the] pudding starts cooling [it] makes [little] balls [of] water on [the] Saran Wrap , [so] , [when] [you] pull [the] Saran Wrap back [, you] sort [of] should be [a] [little] careful , pull [it] back [and] shake [the] water off [the] Saran Wrap [and] [I] might put [it] back on . But , um , 
B|100| M: Now _that's_ interesting . 
A|101| A: [Yeah ,] after , well [when] [it] starts steaming [a] lot [, uh [,] I] definitely _, yeah_ , put [it] in [the] refrigerator , 
B|102| M: Uh [, I'll] bet [you] _do [that_ [,] yeah] . 
A|103| A: [but] , um [, [I] ,] my father always told [me] if [you] put hot food in your refrigerator you're going [to [make] it] [work] [too] hard . 
B|104| M: [Oh , yeah] . 
A|105| A: [That's] [, yeah] , 
B|106| M: [And [,] uh] . 
A|107| A: [so] [, that's] why [I] [do [that] .] 
B|108| M: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
A|109| A: So , well [, [I] don't know] [that's] my , my [great] hard recipe .
