B|53| M: [But] [, uh] . 
A|54| A: [Oh ,] yes _, but we_ try [, you _know ,] I_ try [, my] husband also , we're involved [in] _everything_ our _kids_ does 
B|55| M: Uh-oh . 
A|56| A: _because_ _, uh [,_ my] dad died [, you know ,] _when_ [I was] less than [a] year _old_ 
B|57| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [so] [I] _always_ [just] had [a] mother . _So_ [I] _always_ [thought] , _when_ [I] _have kids_ [, you _know ,] I_ [really] _want to be_ involved _with them_ . 
B|59| M: _Yeah [,_ [I] [,] I] think [that's] [the thing] _that really_ hit home [a] [little] bit _, though_ _, I mean [,_ I] _don't_ [have a] lot [of friends that] _, that_ _have children , but_ [I] think , I'm [always] hearing [a] lot about [the] [kids] [that] [have] [them] [and] _how_ [they're] [doing] [so] _well_ [, you] [, _you] don't_ hear [a] lot [, you] hear [a] [little] [, you] probably hear [a] whole lot about [them] from your [friends that] [have kids] . 
A|60| A: Material things , yes [, that] is , yes ,

A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| M: [you know [,] and] _you don't_ [, you] don _, you have to_ think about [that] _, and , _you_ can't_ [just] say _, well_ [, you] need [to] exercise [, you] got [to be] active , you've got _to do_ [what] [you] [want _to] do_ [, [and] I [,] I] think [that's] important [, you] , _you're_ [not] [just] [going to] sit there [and] say _, Well , I_ need _to do_ _this_ [, but] [I] need some [time] _to do it ._ 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| M: [but] [he's] [, _you] can't_ [, _you] don't_ [have] _, you have to_ [have] all [that] [in] , [in] your life . 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| M: [so] _, it_ [just] [kind of] makes [you] feel _good_ , _you're_ [kind of] bonding [with them] [and it] makes [you] [not] feel guilty [, and] [it's] [something] [that] [, _you] don't_ _have _to_ do_ [every] day . 
A|72| A: [Oh ,] uh-huh . [Yeah .] 
B|73| M: [so] [, _you] can_ [see] [that] [there's] [a] lot [of] changes [, [and] I] think [, I] think [that] [, uh] . 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| M: _you have [to_ be] [a] certain income holder [and] [that's] [it] _, you have to_ [go] back [to] _work_ [and that] [, that] _you have_ all these rights [that] you've beenogged [over] [and] [over] [and that] [just] doesn't _work_ , 
A|76| A: [Yeah [,] you have to] 
B|77| M: _And_ [, uh] .

A|88| A: [Uh-huh] [, yeah] [, I] agree [with] [you] very _much_ _so ._ Now [, we] waited several _years_ before [we] started having [children] [because] [we] [was] _still_ [in] _college [,_ and] [we] knew [time] wise , or [, and] _money_ wise , [too] 
B|89| M: [Yeah [,] I] [know , [I] ,] I'm [still] [going] through [college] myself [, but] [I've] _been_ married about [eight] [years] , [so .]

A|104| A: [Oh , yeah] _, _if_ you_ _if [you_ can] [, yeah .]

B|109| M: Uh , I'm [, I've] [been] trying [to] [get] [a] [, uh ,] [a] teaching [degree [,] but] [it's] [just] [, I] _don't_ [know , I] think [it's] , I'd [like] [to] [stay] [at] home [and my] wife [would] [like] [to] [go] back [to] school [and ,] [you're] [right [,] I] could [go] [to] [a] private school . 
A|110| A: [Oh [,] that's] [, my] husband's _into_ [, uh ,] computers . 
B|111| M: [Yeah ,] [he's] , he works _for_ [the] government , [so] [he's] sort [of] [into] [that] .

B|121| M: [And] [, uh [,] [I] ,] I'm [not] sure [I] [would] [want to be] stuck [in] [that] situation . 
A|122| A: [Oh .] 
B|123| M: [So] [, you know ,] [there's] , there [are] [places] , [like] [you] said , where [you can] [just] [go] ahead [and] pay cash _for_ [as] [much] [as] [you] [want] [, but you] don taj [a] nickel . 
A|124| A: Then you'll [never] _leave_ . 
B|125| M: [No , no] [, no .] 
A|126| A: [Oh .] [Uh-huh .]
