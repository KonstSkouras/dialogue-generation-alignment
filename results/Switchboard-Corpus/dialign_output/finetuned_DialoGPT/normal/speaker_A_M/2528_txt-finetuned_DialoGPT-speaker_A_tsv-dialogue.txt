A|11| A: [Yeah .] 
B|12| M: _Okay_ [, I _, I] think I've_ heard [about] [that] . 
A|13| A: [I] _just_ [like] [I] _just_ finished watching [that] [a] few minutes ago , _Um _,_ and_ _it_ _and _,_ _that_ _,_ that's_ [a] interesting _one_ [.

A|17| A: _also_ saves _a lot of_ _time_ with commercials . 
B|18| M: _Well [,_ _yeah [,] I_ guess] [that's] true [, that] _is_ true . 
A|19| A: _Oh , [I_ have] . _I've _,_ I've , I_ watched [that] late _, um [,_ I guess] _it's on_ late _Saturday_ nights or _something_ , 
B|20| M: [Yeah _,] it's [,_ it [was] _on] [,_ uh ,] [Saturday night] . 
A|21| A: [that's] entering [the] day as _well_ . 
B|22| M: [Oh] [yeah [,] it] _is_ _, it's _,_ it , it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|23| A: _Have_ _you ,_ [have] , [have] [you] [seen] _this_ often ? 
B|24| M: [Um [,] _yeah ,] _I_ saw_ [it [,] um] . 
A|25| A: _Oh , really ?_

A|27| A: [Yeah .] 
B|28| M: _and I_ [watch] [it] [at] five _thirty_ _in the_ morning , 
A|29| A: Really ? [I ,] 
B|30| M: [And] [so [,] you know _,] it's _,_ it , it_ [really] _is_ . 
A|31| A: _That_ [don't] [, it [, it] , it] seems [like [,] _I] mean ,_ _if_ wrestling [is] prime _time_ , professional wrestling [, it] seems [like] [it's] [just] , [just] , [just] [like] pros [in] [a] wrestling [to] _me_ [, I don't] [, I don't] [see] any difference though , 
B|32| M: [Yeah [.] [Yeah] .] 
A|33| A: _I , I don't_ understand [it _,] they_ consider [it] violent [. [I] have] [so] ever [, [I] have] [seen] [it] [on ,] where we are [, I] live [in] [, uh ,] Rochester , New York _, and [I_ think] [a] , 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of] [that] . 
A|35| A: _Yes_ . 
B|36| M: [Oh , really ?] 
A|37| A: Where are [you] ?

B|40| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|41| A: [I think] [it's] been [on [,] I think [I've] seen] [it] during [the] day . 
B|42| M:  !!! % !!?!! Remind [me] . 
A|43| A: Definitely [seen] [it] [on ,] [on ,] during [the] day down there _, and [I_ don't] [think] [it's] [a] very violent show [, I think] [it's] [funny [.] [I] think] [it's] [a] _real good_ concept [, I think] [it's] _something_ completely new . 
B|44| M:  !!! % !! ; !! etwork !! Remind [me] . 
A|45| A: [I think] [so [,] I think] [because] people _sort of_ _get_ through [, you know _,] um [,_ I _think] that_ people _sort of_ learn [the] importance [of] _sort of_ physical fitness as _well_ as [the ,] as _well_ as [, you know ,] _some_ mental fitness [and [I] _think] that_ people _sort of_ learn _good_ sportsmanship [and] [so] forth . 
B|46| M: [Yeah .] 
A|47| A: [Well ,] [don't] _they_ take people who [have] _some_ _sort of_ _, um ,_ big abilities [like] _and [,_ and] [at] least _they_ used [to] when [it ,] when [it [,] the] first ones [I saw] _they_ had _, um ,_ [a] man [on] who [was] [, uh ,] he played college football [and] almost _went_ pro [, _and] they_ had [a] , [a] woman who [was] [a] black belt [in] karate [and] she [was] _the [, uh_ ,] she [was] [in the] junior Olympics or _something_ or _they_ seem [to] [have] people who [have] very , very big sports backgrounds . _To_ [have] _they ,_ leaned away from [that] _sort of_ , 
B|48| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|49| A: [Oh _,] that's_ how _they do_ [it .] 
B|50| M: [and then [they] [,] uh] [they] [also] [have] [a] pool [and _they] have_ [a] swimming pool [and , uh] 
A|51| A: Really ? 
B|52| M: [Yeah [,] [and] , uh] . 
A|53| A: [Yeah [,] okay] [, I] [just] _thought_ [they] had _some ,_ 
B|54| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|55| A: [yeah , _I] thought_ [they] had _some_ _sort of_ [, _I] mean , _I_ thought_ [they] were [just] poor people [like] us [I guess] _not_ _, that's_ great . 
B|56| M: [Well [,] [I [, I] don't] [know] [,] I've [, I] think , I] [really] [think [that] _, um ,] the_ way _things_ [have] changed over [the] years [and [,] um] [I think [the] [,] the] women's movement [sort of] brought [in the] individuality [, I guess ,] rather than [the , uh] 
A|57| A: _But_ , maybe I'll try [it] _one_ day . I'll _get_ [on] there _one_ day [and] [see] _if_ [I] [can] [, uh [,] um ,] what , what _do_ [they] win _, [they_ _,] they_ win money [I think ,] [don't] [they] ? 
B|58| M: _Yeah , [they_ do] . 
A|59| A: Really ? 
B|60| M: [Yeah , so] . 
A|61| A: _Wow_ . _All_ [that] _for_ getting _tennis_ balls shot [at] [you] [at] [a] hundred miles an hour .

A|63| A: _One_ _little_ _ball_ here [and] there [, yeah [,] and] _this_ guy's beating [you] _up_ [, [so] [,] I don't know] [the] beating _up_ part [. [I ,] I] actually feel [the] _tennis_ balls would hurt . 
B|64| M: [Oh [, I] [,] well [,] you] [see] [, [I'm] not] _a tennis_ [fan] [. [I] mean [, I] like] _to watch the_ [ball] go [around] [, [you] [,] but] [, I] [really] [don't] [like] [to] [see] [the] [ball] hit [in the] air [, you] [get] hit [in] _your_ hand [, and] [you] [get] caught [up] [in] [it .] 
A|65| A: _They_ look [like ,] [Yeah , they] seem [like] [a tennis] [ball] [but] [it] almost doesn't look [like] [it's] almost livable [yeah [,] the] best [I , I don't] [think] [I] could [, I , I] could handle those [tennis] balls . _So_ , what else [to] [you] _tape_ besides AMERICAN [at] , there anything else ?

B|76| M: [Well _,] it's [,_ it , it] [is] [fun] [, and [I] [like] the] challenge [of] trying [to] find [something] [that] [you] [can] [watch] . 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] [Oh , okay] [, well [,] they] seem [to] be [on] later , 
B|78| M: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
A|79| A: all , always [right] , [right] before [the] news [is] when [I] catch them [. [I ,] I] tend [to] , [if] nothing else [is] [in the] town television [at] eleven o'clock [just] [to watch the] news [, and] or , or NIGHTLINE or [something] , [just] [sort of] [get] [a] [good] [, you know ,] [a] [good] , [a] [good] [think] _for the_ day . 
B|80| M: [Yeah [,] that's] true . 
A|81| A: [Yes] . [When] [is] yours [on] ? 
B|82| M: [Oh [,] [it's] _on] _at_ ten_ [now] . 
A|83| A: [Oh ,] gosh [, well [,] I'm] sorry [I] interrupted [, um ,] 
B|84| M: That's [okay .] 
A|85| A: [Yeah ,] ours [is] [on ,] 
B|86| M: [Okay .] 
A|87| A: actually [it ,] ours [is] [on at] eleven [it [,] it's [,] um ,] eleven o'clock [now] here or eleven twenty-five [now] here [in] New York . _Um [, I_ think] [they] [they do] [that [,] I think] [they] put [things] [on at] [, um ,] eleven o'clock here [and [I] think] [they] put [it] [like] eleven o'clock [, um ,] California _time_ , [like] [in] California [but] [in the] middle [they] [sort of] [, um ,] [like] _central time_ or mountain _time_ [they [,] they] push [things] back . [So] [, I] [was] actually , actually [I'm not sure] [, I] [was] [in] [, I] [was] [in] Iowa awhile ago [, and] noticed [that] everything [was] an hour earlier [, [so] ,] does [your] prime _time_ start [at] seven o'clock ? 
B|88| M: [Um [, I] don't [know] [,] I , I] [went] [to] school [in] [central time] zone [, and [I] thought] [it was] five _thirty_ . 
A|89| A: Wait , no , no , 
B|90| M: [but] [, um] . 
A|91| A: [not] , [not] even [the] news [but] [do] [they have] [like [,] um ,] [do] [like] [sort of] all [the] regular sitcoms [and] [so] forth , start [at] seven o'clock ? [You] [, [so] ,] [like [,] you know [,] the] regular television shows [that] are [, that] are very popular , [do] [they] start [at] , seven or , or [at] eight ? 
B|92| M: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] yeah] . 
A|93| A: [Right] , [because] [that] would [the] eight o'clock here . 
B|94| M: [Right] . 
A|95| A: [Yeah [,] [that] [,] that] would all start [at] , [at] [, um [,] that] would all start [at] , [at] eight o'clock here [, that] wouldn't start [at] seven . [We] [have] [, um ,] [at] seven o'clock we [just] [have] [, um , [the] ,] they'll play [, you know [,] [they] have] old reruns [of] CHEERS or [something] from seven [to] seven [thirty] [, and then] [something] else from seven [thirty] [to] eight 
B|96| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|97| A: [and] ours start [at] , [at] , [at] , [at] eight [and] end [at] eleven [, that's] why we [. [I ,] I] would actually [like] [it] better [if] everything started [at] seven [and] ended [at ten] . 
B|98| M: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
A|99| A: [Oh [,] that's] great . 
B|100| M: [And] [, uh [,] [and] , uh] [I guess] [there's [some] [,] [there's] a] [little] bit [of a] decline [in the] family values [, but] [, uh] . 
A|101| A: [Oh ,] all [the] [time] . [Do] [you] [watch] CHEERS 
B|102| M:  !!! remind [me] [to say] thank [you] [for the] call . 
A|103| A: [it's] [at] [, that] [was] actually [a] big dilemma [for] [me] [now] [because] [, um ,] CHEERS , CHEERS [and] TWIN PEAKS are [now] [on the] same [time] ,
