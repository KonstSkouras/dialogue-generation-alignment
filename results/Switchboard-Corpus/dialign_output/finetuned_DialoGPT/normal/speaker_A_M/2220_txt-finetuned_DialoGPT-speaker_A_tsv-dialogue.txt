B|76| M: [Okay] , well , [we _have] a_ daughter [in] _Texas_ [, and] she's , um , she's [in the] national curriculum [, [and] , uh ,] [she] took [the] national [one] [and] [she] took _it [, and_ I] took [it] [with] [me] [, _and] then_ , um [I] took [the one] [with] [me] also [, _and] it's_ [just] [the] same thing [. [I don't] [know] [,] I] donno [, [I] , [I] think] [I'd] [have [to] take] [the] advice _, you know ,_ _from_ [a] , [a] , _an_ English major [to] [a] , [to] [a] university [, [and] see] [how] [they] treat [them] , _you're [,_ you] [don't] [have to] _have a_ [, you] [have to] _be_ _an_ expert [to] _get_ [in] [on] subjects [like that [,] [and] you] [have] , _you've got to_ _be_ [a] [good] student [to] _get_ _an_ idea [of] [what] [a] subject [is] . 
A|77| A: [Yeah , yeah .] 
B|78| M: [Okay .] 
A|79| A: Just because there's [a] friend up there , [not] because there's [much] else 
B|80| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|81| A: For colleges ? 
B|82| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|83| A: [Well ,] they're [not] 
B|84| M: [but] , 
A|85| A: They're [not] [going to] recruit [me] [anymore [,] I'm] through . No more _for_ _me ._ 
B|86| M: [Oh ,] okay . 
A|87| A: What , [what] [do] [you] [do] ? 
B|88| M: [I'm] [a] nurse . 
A|89| A: Are [you] [going to] go [to] East [Texas] _for_ [that] ? 
B|90| M: [Yeah .] 
A|91| A: That'd probably [be] [pretty] [interesting] [. [I] was] summonsed down [to the] courthouse last week . They had summonsed eight hundred people [, about] four hundred showed up [, and] [it was] _for_ [a] murder trial . 
B|92| M: [Oh ,] really ? 
A|93| A: This guy had supposedly [, uh ,] strangled this woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling down her throat [and] up her nose Anyway , this [is] happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|94| M: [Huh] . 
A|95| A: [And] [they] had us fill out [a] long questionnaire . We stayed till [about] [one] thirty [and] they're [going _to] call_ [the] ones [that] they're interested [in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three at [a] time [and] [the] trial won't [take] place until June . 
B|96| M: Uh-hauhuh [, uh] . 
A|97| A: [And] [they] say [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . [And] this guy [in] front [of] [me] said [, I] [can't] _believe_ [I was] summonsed [. [I] was] [an] investigator [and [I] was] tailing [the] woman [that was] killed . [Well ,] [then] [I have a] friend at [school] [that] has [a] boyfriend [that's] [a] lawyer [and] [he] said [that] this woman this socialite [in Plano] had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the one] [that's] accused [was] [the one] [that] actually did [it] . [And] [she] has since taken off [with] another lawyer [who] had been [, uh ,] getting cocaine [from] his client [and then] selling [it , and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited him [and] [he's] [going to] testify _for_ [the] State against her [so] he'll [have] his sentence reduced . 
B|98| M: [Oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|99| A: [Yeah .] 
B|100| M: [Okay] [, [I] , [I] [was] just] [sitting here] waiting [for] _somebody_ [to call] [me .] 
A|101| A: The [, the] investigator [. Yeah [,] he] [, he] [got] off [right] away . 
B|102| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of [that] ,] _oh , gosh_ !! 
A|103| A: [And] [I] wrote [that] down [on] [my] questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that ,] 
B|104| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|105| A: [so I] figure [that] [that] will make [me] biased [and I] won't [be] chosen . 
B|106| M: Right . 
A|107| A: Hopefully 
B|108| M: [But] [, uh [,] I] [do] [feel] [like that [,] uh] ... 
A|109| A: [Yeah .] No . *aa 
B|110| M: [But] [, uh ,] 
A|111| A: [I] said [that [,] I] could _believe_ [in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but I] _would_ [be] , [I'd] find [it] hard [to] levy [that] against [somebody] . 
B|112| M: [Well [,] [I] [, [I] don't] [know] [,] uh] [I [,] uh] [. [I] think] [, uh] [you know] [in [the] ,] [in the] cases [like] [, uh] [uh ,] [in] [, uh] England [and] France [where] [they] [have] [the] death penalty [and you] [have to] register as [a] , as [a] social [, uh] citizen 
A|113| A: You [know .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|114| M: [they] [would] , [they] [would] [not] [believe] [that] [you [know] .] 
A|115| A: [Yeah .] [But] [then] [when] [you're ,] [when] [you're] picked , [see] [I was] picked [for] another murder trial before 
B|116| M: Uh-hoh . 
A|117| A: [oh , gosh] [and it's] [so] hard because [, you know ,] everybody [is] wanting [to] go [on] [and] [get] [the] sentence done [, and] if [you're] trying [to] hold out [, you know ,] there's [so] [much] pressure [on] [you] [and] [you've got to] come up [with] [a] decision . 
B|118| M: Uh [, yeah .]
