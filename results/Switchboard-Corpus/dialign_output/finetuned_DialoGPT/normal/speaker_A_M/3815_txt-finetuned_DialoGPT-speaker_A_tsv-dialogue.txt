A|13| A: _Well [,_ _I] guess_ _I'm [,_ uh ,] more traditional [in] _that [I_ don't] _like_ power windows _or_ power locks , _because_ [the] people _that I_ [know] who _have them_ always seem [to have] trouble with [them .] 
B|14| M: _Uh [,_ uh] . 
A|15| A: _And , uh ,_ [so] [I don't] [, I] [just] [don't] _like_ anything _that I_ _can't_ figure [out] why [it] doesn't work 
B|16| M: Uh-uh . Uh-uh , yeah . 
A|17| A: [And then] [I] want [, you] [know ,] good [, uh ,] gas mileage _and I_ want an air bag [and [, uh] , _I] guess ,_ 
B|18| M: Sure [, uh-huh .] 
A|19| A: No [, I] haven't . Have [you] ? 
B|20| M: [I] _think_ [I] [have] . 
A|21| A: Somehow [I] [just] [think] [, you] [know [,] _I] like_ [the] idea 
B|22| M: [Well ,] _it's_ _, it_ _really_ is nice . 
A|23| A: [Right .] 
B|24| M: _I mean , you_ [, you] [can't] deny _that _,_ but_ [you] can certainly , 
A|25| A: [Right] _, that's_ [a] good idea . 
B|26| M: [And [, uh ,] _I] don't _know_ , if_ _, if_ they'd _really_ make [them] mandatory [, I] [think] _it would_ _probably_ make _a _lot_ of_ sense [to [have] [them] .] 
A|27| A: _Uh-huh_ [, uh-huh .] 
B|28| M: _So _, I_ _,_ [I'm_ [,] I] am _not_ [, _I] don't know_ _if_ [I] _would_ go [that] far _, but [,_ uh] . 
A|29| A: [Well [,] I ,] actually [I don't know] [a lot] [about] different brands [. I] tend [to have] [, you] [know _,] my_ requirements _like_ _the last_ time _I bought [a_ car] [I [,] _I] guess_ _I did_ sort [of] prefer _American_ [and] _my_ requirements were basically [, you] [know ,] good repair record , good mileage [, uh ,] _and I_ needed air-conditioning [and [, uh] ,] [can't] remember _what_ _my_ , oh [, I] wanted [uh ,] stick shift . [And ,] [so] [I] didn't [have a] whole [lot of] choice There _was_ one [car] [in] all [of] [the] , [the] metropolitan area _that I_ could find [that [,] you] [know ,] _was_ sort [of] [a] medium priced [car] with [a] stick shift [in] [it .] 
B|30| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|31| A: It [, it] turned [out] [to be] [a ,] [a] Chrysler . [Uh] Lancer . 
B|32| M: [Oh] , yeah . 
A|33| A: [Yeah .] 
B|34| M: [Yeah] , _it's_ [, uh] 
A|35| A: No , [a] five speed . [And] [it ,] basically [, it] _was_ _something_ [that] [a] military guy had ordered [and] hadn't picked up , [and] [so] [it] had been on [the] [lot] three months [and] they were [really] eager [to] sell [it .] 
B|36| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|37| A: [So , _I] guess_ [in] this area , at least [, you] [know , _if] _it's_ not_ automatic [, it] doesn't move . 
B|38| M: [Yeah .] [Well [,] that's] true . 
A|39| A: [Well [,] I] [just] wanted [it] _because_ , again [, I] had [, _I] guess_ traditionally always had [a car] [that] had one _and I_ thought [it would] [be] more reliable . 
B|40| M: [Right .] 
A|41| A: [Uh ,] 
B|42| M: [Well] [I guess [,] uh [,] my] next [car] is going [to be] [American] [because] [I] [have a] Honda [and I] [really] [like] [it .] 
A|43| A: [I] found [that] [out] [. [I] mean , you] [know ,] [the] people [would] [just] sort [of] look at me [like] [, you] must [be] crazy when [I ,] went [in] [to] , [and] asked [and] [that] _was_ [a] requirement [so ,] 
B|44| M: [Well [,] that's] true . 
A|45| A: [So ,] 
B|46| M: [Well ,] _I've_ _, I'm not_ _sure_ [if] _I've talked to_ anybody else [in] [the] eighties [or] [not] _, but_ _I've_ got [to] say [that I] [think] [the last] thing [I did] [to] [a car] [was] [I bought a] Dodge Caravan . 
A|47| A: [Well [,] I'm not] even [sure] all [of them] are anymore . At least [in] this area . 
B|48| M: [Yeah] [, [I] don't know] [if it's] [, uh ,] is [it [,] uh] 
A|49| A: Not [that I] [was] looking for sports cars [, but ,] now [the] people [I've talked to] [don't] seem [to have] stick shift . 
B|50| M: [Yeah .] 
A|51| A: [And so] why _do_ [you] [like] stick shift ? 
B|52| M: [Well ,] [it's not] [my] favorite [but] [it's] [something] [I] [do] enjoy doing . 
A|53| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|54| M: [and I] [have] [to] keep track [of] [what] [I'm] putting [in] [and] [what] [I ,] [what] [I] put [in] . 
A|55| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|56| M: [And] [I like] [it] where [it's] cold . 
A|57| A: [Right] , [and] actually [it's] [probably] safer on [, you] [know ,] at long trips [because] [it] keeps [you] more active . 
B|58| M: [Right .] 
A|59| A: [So ,]
