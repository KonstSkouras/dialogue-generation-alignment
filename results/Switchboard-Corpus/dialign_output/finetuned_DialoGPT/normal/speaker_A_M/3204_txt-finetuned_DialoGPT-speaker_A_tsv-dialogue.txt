A|42| A: [They] don't go [and] see [them] . That's right .

A|46| A: _You_ [know _,] um [,_ I , I think] [nursing homes are] , [are] _, um ,_ [some] [are] [good] 
B|47| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| A: [I [have] to] say _that ._

A|52| A: [Um ,] 
B|53| M: [Um] . 
A|54| A: Right , right . 
B|55| M: [I [, I think] that's] [a] [really] important point _. I think_ [, uh ,] [in the] , [in] our society [, um ,] we've , we're [really] _trying_ _to [,_ uh] 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: _But [,_ uh] . 
A|58| A: [I] hope [so] .

A|60| A: _You_ [know ,] _it's_ [, _I think] it's_ [very] difficult [in the] first place [to] make [that] choice _to have_ [them] go [there] . 
B|61| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue . 
A|62| A: [And] then if [you] find [out] [that] [they] [are] _not_ having [good] care [, you know [,] I'm] sure [that] [it] is just [, you know ,] you'd pull [them] [out] [of] [there] [so] fast . 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: [And [, uh] [,] and] yet if [you] didn't feel [like] [you] could _be [a_ good] caretaker [I] don't [, uh ,] _it's_ [a] [very] , [very] hard decision [I think] . 
B|65| M: [Yeah [,] I] agree . 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh [.] [I think] that's] right , 
B|67| M: _But [,_ uh] . 
A|68| A: [and] especially if you're _not_ [a] person [that] is [like] [a] medical person maybe or something [that] [the] person needs medical treatment . 
B|69| M: [Yeah [,] I] agree . 
A|70| A: Now [I know] [a] friend [of] mine who had [a] father [, uh ,] she brought [to] her [home] [, uh ,] [to] live [there [,] but] he needed [the] medical treatment [and] she had [a] [nursing] person come [in] [like] three times [a] week [to ,] [to] help him [out] . 
B|71| M: Uh-uh . 
A|72| A: [And] [that] might _be a_ partial solution , or something . 
B|73| M: _Well [, I_ think that's] probably [the] only way [that] we're [going to] get [to] [that [.] [I think] it's] [going [to] [have] [to] be a] continuing problem . 
A|74| A: [But [,] um [,] I] personally am [for] [the] [trying] [it] at [home] caretaker part before [I think] I'd ever ,

A|76| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .]
