B|4| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|5| A: _I know_ _so , I_ felt _kind of_ sorry _for_ him . _that_ must _have_ _been_ _hard_ on him _because_ _he's_ _just_ _a_ person _but _,_ um_ _, I_ never _, a_ major owner _of_ our _of the_ team _here_ .

A|13| A: _Oh _,_ I_ _saw_ _that ._ 
B|14| M: _And [,_ uh] . 
A|15| A: [Yeah .] 
B|16| M: [he [,] _he] said_ [he] [saw] [it] [in] [a little] classroom _at_ high school [, _and] he [said_ that] _it was_ [a] private school . 
A|17| A: _I want to_ see your driver's _I _, I_ _, I_ don't_ , 
B|18| M: Uh _, well [,_ he's] [been] _in _the_ , uh [,_ _in] the_ _in the_ forties , 
A|19| A: _you're_ _not_ President Bush . _I know_ [and he said] _yeah _,_ it_ does _so_ fast _, I_ heard [it] on [the] radio . _I_ heard [the] audio portion on [the] radio [in the] car _but_ _I didn't_ see [it] _but ,_ 
B|20| M: [Yeah _,] it's_ [, uh ,] 
A|21| A: _That's_ about _my_ extent _of_ _, um_ , about _baseball _,_ I don't know ,_ [that] _much_ about _it ._ 
B|22| M: [Yeah _,] I'm_ trying [to] [think [,] [I] guess] _I'm not_ _really [,_ um] 
A|23| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|24| M: _and they_ _got_ _out of the_ bottom [and] went [in] [first] _and they_ went [in] [two] days [later] . 
A|25| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|26| M: [but he] pitched [for] [the] Indians _, so_ . 
A|27| A: Did [they] ? 
B|28| M: _They_ won [in] [a] squeaker . 
A|29| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|30| M: [and , uh [,] _I] _was_ just_ _sitting_ _there_ _with_ _, with_ absolutely _no_ idea [, I [, I] mean [,] [I] didn't] [even know] who won [the] pennant _last year ._ 
A|31| A: _That's_ [so] stupid [that] _you_ all _have_ [two] teams . 
B|32| M: _Well _,_ they're_ , _they've_ _only_ [been] _doing it_ [for a] couple [of] _years ._ 
A|33| A: _That's_ [really] stupid . 
B|34| M: [I mean _,] they're_ , _they've_ _got_ [two] , [two] great big cities . Chicago [and] Pittsburgh . 
A|35| A: _Yeah _, I_ know_ . 
B|36| M: _But [,_ uh [,] _you know [,] I_ don't _know ,] _you_ _,_ you get_ [in] _a [,_ a] heated argument _over_ _it _,_ and _you_ get_ into _a [,_ you] _go_ _down_ [to] [the] _store_ [and] buy [a] pair [of] those _and _you_ [,_ _and] _then_ you_ look _at_ [the] price _of _them_ _and_ you_ _say _,_ well [,_ you] [can] _get_ [, you] _got_ [two] hundred dollars _for them_ 
A|37| A: [Yeah .] 
B|38| M: [so [, I] don't know _,] it's_ [, it] seems [like] _it's_ _always_ [been] [the] New Orleans Giants [, _you] ,_ 
A|39| A: The Texas Rangers _, they_ _, they_ lost _, I think_ . 
B|40| M: [Yeah [,] _they] _did_ ._ 
A|41| A: [But] _I know_ [that] [last year] _we_ [did] [go] _to _a baseball_ game_ [last year .] We [got] free tickets _because_ someone [at] our church , _one_ [of the] deacons [at] church [, um] , parks cars [at] The Mansion [at] Turtle Creek which is [like] _one_ [of [the] , uh ,] [the] places _and stuff_ . 
B|42| M: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
A|43| A: [And] [he's] their head chauffeur , is _this_ _funny_ , as [they're] parking [the] cars [the] valet service . 
B|44| M: [Yeah _,] that's_ _funny ._ 
A|45| A: [Yeah [,] he] makes _good_ money _too_ [doing] [that] , you'd be [I was] shocked _, but_ anyway , someone gave _an_ Iranian [a] tip [of] four Rangers tickets [last year] , 
B|46| M: [Yeah .] 
A|47| A: [and then] [the] Iranian couldn't [, he] [didn't] _want_ [them] [, _so] he_ gave [them] [to] Alan [, and] Alan [and] his Dad _had_ plans [that] night [so] [they] gave [them] [to] us [, _so] he_ decided [that] some wealthy man tipped _this_ Iranian [, with] _baseball_ tickets , 
B|48| M: [Yeah .] 
A|49| A: [and] _we_ ended up [with] [them] _, right ._ [And] [so] _we_ were , walking up 
B|50| M: [I don't know [,] uh [,] I don't] [think] I've _ever_ actually seen [a baseball game] advertised anywhere [in the] Dallas area . 
A|51| A: _and I_ looked [at] _my_ husband _and _I_ said [,_ you know] what Kyle _this_ is The Mansion [at] Turtle Creek [a] tip [I] bet these _are_ [really] _good_ seats [and] [so] _we_ ended up on [first] base _right_ [down] [there] on [the] floor , 
B|52| M: [Oh _,] that's_ _good ._ 
A|53| A: oh _, yeah ,_ _we_ [they] called us [at] _five_ [and] [the] [game] started [at] seven [so] _we_ [just] threw everything together , ran [over] [and] [got] [the] tickets [and] walked [and] [so] _we_ took [two] _kids_ [with] us [and] nobody brings [two] children [in] these seats [, you know] _because_ , 
B|54| M: [That's] great . 
A|55| A: _yeah [,_ and _you] just_ _sit_ [down] [and] all [the] girls were all dressed up [you know , I] [just] [was] [there] _, you know , like_ [I'm] loaded [, I'm] _here_ [, you know [,] [and] , uh _,] _it was_ just_ _kind of_ [funny] _because_ [, you know _,] but_ _we_ [got] [to] _sit_ by [first] base if [they did] hit _a ball_ [I] would _have_ [been] afraid [it] would _have_ knocked _my_ face _in [,_ you know] . 
B|56| M: [Yeah .] 
A|57| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|58| M: [but [,] I don't know ,] we're _going _to_ _have_ [a_ ball] [this] [year .] 
A|59| A: Really ? 
B|60| M: [Yeah [, I] mean] _there's_ [not] _a whole_ _lot ._ 
A|61| A: [I'm] glad _my_ husband's [not] [like] _that ._ 
B|62| M: [Yeah .] 
A|63| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|64| M: [so he] goes [out] [and] plays [and that] [kind of] _stuff [,_ [but] [,] uh _,] it's_ [just] [not] [something] [I want [to] do] [, you know , like] [I said ,] 
A|65| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|66| M: So [we] went [to a [baseball] [,] and] _I'm not_ [really] [a] big [baseball] fan 
A|67| A: [That's] [funny .] 
B|68| M: [it was just] _like _, you_ just_ [go] [and] [sit] [there] [and he] tries [to] eat _it [,_ you] _can't do_ [anything .] He's [like ,] gee , [you're] eating [too] [much] . 
A|69| A: You miss [the] [whole] thing . 
B|70| M: [Yeah [,] and [I] think] _it's_ _, it's_ [really] _neat ._ 
A|71| A: [That's] [funny .] Where is [he] from [in] France ? [Uh-huh .] 
B|72| M: _in , [in_ the] Calais [part] . 
A|73| A: [Yeah .] _I [have_ [a] _,] I had a_ friend [in] college from Strasbourg , 
B|74| M: Uh-hoh . 
A|75| A: [Uh-huh .] Paris . [And] _my_ cousin lives [in] Paris [and] she's lived [there] [for] [like ,] oh , off [and] on [for] twenty [years .] 
B|76| M: _Oh , really ?_ 
A|77| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|78| M: Okay . 
A|79| A: Saint Claude is [that] sound familiar ? 
B|80| M: [Yeah [,] yeah _,] _that's_ the_ [name] _of [it_ .] 
A|81| A: [Yeah .] 
B|82| M: [that's] where [I] _live_ [, [but] [,] uh ,] I've _only_ [been] [there] once [so] far [, but] I've [been] [there] [a] couple [of] _times_ . 
A|83| A: [Oh , really ?] 
B|84| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|85| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|86| M: _it's_ _, it's_ very , very [hard] [to] _get_ into , [to] _get_ , [to] [the] Dallas area . 
A|87| A: [That's] [neat .] [Yeah ,] she married [and they] [have] twelve children . 
B|88| M: [Oh ,] wow . 
A|89| A: She has twelve children . 
B|90| M: [Oh ,] [my] goodness . 
A|91| A: She looks gorgeous _, no_ she's gorgeous [and] she [just] liked having _kids_ [and] she's thin [and [,] I mean ,] four _or_ more children _are_ thin , 
B|92| M: [Oh] . 
A|93| A: [I mean _,] I'm not_ kidding [you] . 
B|94| M: _Well [,_ [you know [,] I] know] [two] _of them_ [that] [are] twins . 
A|95| A: [No ,] your _, I [have_ a] friend now [that] has seven . [And [,] um] [, and] [they're] all eight [and] under [, and] nine [and] under , 
B|96| M: [Oh ,] gosh . 
A|97| A: [they're] all real young [, they're] [just] raised _right_ [that's] what God's told [them] [to do] [but] [they're] [not] condemning [you ,] if [you ,] [we] [only] [have] _one_ child [, you know [,] they] [don't] [say [,] they] [don't] put on bad _or_ [anything] which is [good] _because_ [it] would be easy [, I'm] sure , [for them] [to do] [that] [, you get] [a] conviction [like] [that] [and you] [think] everyone should [have] [it .] [And] [so] [I'm] real proud [of them] _because_ [they're] aren't [really [,] they] [don't] [do] [that] [at] all . 
B|98| M: [Yeah .] 
A|99| A: You _go in_ their bathroom [and] [there's] ten tooth brushes [in] [there] . [And] [I] [always] give her [a] [hard] time whose toothbrush [did] [you] [really] use [this] morning 
B|100| M: [Oh [,] no] . 
A|101| A: [Uh-huh .] [They] [live] lean [for] _one_ thing [and they] tithe [and they] [it] puts [a whole] [in] your money bag , *spelling: hole [we] [don't] honor God [with] [this] portion [and] [so] [they] _, I think_ [that] helps [a] [lot .] _I think [that's_ the] key [, in] [he [,] like] his sales [last year] [he] [just] works [a] normal job . He probably has _an_ income [of] thirty-five thousand [, but] [last year] [he] made [that] [got] him [a] bonus [of] twenty-five thousand which allowed him [to] pay cash [for a] full size van . He loves God [, I mean _,] it was_ [the] biggest thing [that] any _one_ [in] [this] company _had_ [ever] done , 
B|102| M: Uh . 
A|103| A: [and he] [got] [to do] [it] [and] [so] God [just] [really] blesses him [in] ways [like] [that] , [do] trust God _because_ [, I don't know ,] _kids_ [are] [a] blessing _and , and_ some people [you know ,] [we] [think] [of] blessings as nice furniture [and] things [like] [that] [, but] _kids_ [are] [just] as [much] [of] [a] blessing inside these material things [but] [it's] [a] different [kind] [and] [a] [lot] [times] people [think ,] oh [, well _,] I'm not_ blessed _I have_ _an_ old car . [But] you've [got] _five_ _kids_ [, you know ,] 
B|104| M: Uh [, _I know] [, I_ have] [, I had [a] [,] [a] [,] uh] [I had] [an] Oldsmobile [that] [I] bought used [for] [, uh] ... 
A|105| A: [you're] [just] as blessed , probably more , _because_ if [you] follow [this] , [there's] [a] [good] book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING , by Richard Fugate 
B|106| M: Uh [, yeah] . 
A|107| A: [and] [he's] [, you know [,] a] [lot] [of] wisdom [in] [it .] [And] [the] _kids_ [at] BIBLE talk about [anything] [but] training [, and] training is different than [anything] else [in , in] psychology doesn't address [it .] A [lot] [of the] psychology [stuff ,] [the] [good] [stuff] [that's] [in] psychology [it] [just] comes [out of the] BIBLE [and they] [don't] quote [you] [the] proverb [out [of] [it] [,] but] [the] things [that] work [in] psychology other [the] [years] [that] [they've] proven [to] work [, they] [just] come [out of the] BIBLE [and] [so] [this] book [it] [just] [really] all these things [and] how [to] train [the] child [so] [they're] [not] [going to] be [a] curse [to] [you] when [they're] thirteen . 
B|108| M: [Yeah [, [I] think] that's] true . 
A|109| A: What [I mean] how [to] train [them] [so] [they're] [going to] be [a] blessing [and] [so [,] you know [,] they] [do] [that] [and they] [, they] [just] [live] lean pretty [much] [they] [don't] , she doesn't shop [at] Foley's [you know [,] _and] stuff_ [like] _that ._ [But] [a] [lot] women die _or_ shop [at] Foley's [so] things , 
B|110| M: [Yeah .] 
A|111| A: It's _like a_ Macy's , [kind of] [store] , 
B|112| M: Right . 
A|113| A: [it's] pretty nice [and] everything's pretty expensive [and [,] you [know [,] you] just] [can't do] [that] [and you] [don't] [go] [to] [baseball] games as [much] _or_ [you get] pictures [like] [we] [did .] You [know] what [I mean] ? 
B|114| M: [Yeah [,] I'm [not] [,] I [, I] [think] [,] [I] was] [, I] went [to] [one] [, [I] guess] [it was] [like [a] [,] a] [year] [or] [so] ago [and I] went [and] bought [a [,] [like] a] membership [at] [the] dollar [store] [and , [and] then] [, [you] [,] you] [go] [and you] buy [like a] pair [of] shoes [and stuff] [and _then] you_ [go in] [and] buy [like [,] [like] ,] maybe , maybe [five] dollars worth [of] merchandise . 
A|115| A: You [do] these fun things [, you know [,] in] other kinds [of] ways [and [I] know] Manhattan's real expensive [but [,] um] [, it's] [kind of] [a] different situation _because_ [you're] probably living [in] [an] apartment _, right_ ? 
B|116| M: Right [, right .] 
A|117| A: [Yeah .] 
B|118| M: [you know ,] we're [in] [a] town home [here] [in] Plano [, _and] it's_ [, [it] [,] it was] [, it] [really] [was] difficult [to] move [because] [there] [was] [so] many [kids] [in the] neighborhood . 
A|119| A: [Well ,] church softball leagues [, [so] ,] 
B|120| M: Right . 
A|121| A: [they're] [not] all boys [and] [right] now [we] [don't] [have a] girls' league [because] [I'm] [the] [one] [that's] supposed [to] start [one] [and I] [just] haven't gotten around [to] [doing [it] .] [I] keep saying [we] need [to have] [one] . [They] [go] , okay , [then] start [one] . [But] everybody wants [to do] [it] [but [,] you know ,] God's [sitting] on [my] heart [and I] [just] hadn't gotten around [to] [doing [it] [,] but] anyway [, so] [they] could [really] [only] [have] four members on [the] team . [I think] [they] [only] [have] four boys . [I don't] [even] [think] [they] [have] [but] [two] old enough [to] play yet . 
B|122| M: Uh , 
A|123| A: [But [,] um] , [then you] [didn't] believe _me_ about her [kids] *listen: [this] [and] utt2 as [one] utt [are] [the] [they] [are] [so] [good .] [I'm not] kidding [you] [but] she does work [with] [them [and] it's] [a] commitment [and ,] [that] [, that's] what [they're] called [to do] . 
B|124| M: [Yeah .] 
A|125| A: [I [have] [a] ,] most [of] [my] friends , 
B|126| M:  !!! % !! ; !! Remind [me] [of] [that .] 
A|127| A: [I know , I] [do] [too] [, I ,] most [of] [my] friends [have] three [or] four [kids] [and they] feel [like [, you] know [,] that's] [really] why God [and] some [of the] people [in] our church use birth control [and] some [of them] [don't] [, I had] [my] tubes tied [so] [you ,]
