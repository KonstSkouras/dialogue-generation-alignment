B|0| M: Um _, I think_ _I was_ lucky _because_ _my_ parents _, I_ _had_ _lived_ _in a_ retirement community _for_ _a_ while _and ,_ uh , _they_ _were_ very active _in_ trying _to_ provide _for_ both . 
A|1| A: _Oh ,_ [my] . 
B|2| M: _and ,_ uh _and _,_ _and_ ,_ uh _I_ thought _that_ _would_ _be_ _the_ smart thing _to_ , _to_ _do_ . 
A|3| A: _Yeah ,_ _so_ [the] convenience , _Right ._ 
B|4| M: _And_ , uh . 
A|5| A: My grandmother [lived] _with_ _us_ , um , until August , um [, _and] we_ made [the] decision [to] put her [in a] nursing home . She has leukemia 
B|6| M: [Oh ,] yeah . 
A|7| A: [and] her , [the] rest _of_ her family [and] her regular doctors [and] everybody _she_ trusted [and] knew [was] [in] Dayton [, and] [were] several thousand miles away 
B|8| M: Uh . 
A|9| A: _so_ [I] made [the] decision [to] put her [in a] nursing home [, and] [my] sister being on [the] other end found one [that] _she_ _could_ _have_ what [was] called an independent living facility . She [had] her own little room [and] didn't _have_ [to] share _it_ _with_ anyone [and] _could_ bring [in] her own chair [and] T V set 
B|10| M: Uh . 
A|11| A: _so_ . 
B|12| M: yeah , that's , [that] _would_ _be_ _kind of_ nice , _too_ . 
A|13| A: Yes . [And] _that ,_ [the] other major factor is [that] _she_ needs blood transfusions every week [to] ten days [, and] [would] _have_ [to] [be] hospitalized [a] day or two , _so_ [in] this facility [they] can [do] _it_ right there from her own room 
B|14| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|15| A: _so_ _she_ didn't _have_ [to] [be] transported back [and] forth . So , _she's_ been there since August [the] thirteenth [and] seems _to have_ adjusted pretty well . _It's_ not her favorite place [to] [be] [in] . She'd much rather [be] here _with_ me . But when _it_ _got to_ [the] point [I was] spending more _time_ at [the] hospital _with_ her , 
B|16| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|17| A: [and] I've _got_ little children here who needed me here _she_ needed somebody [to] watch her twenty-four hours [a] day . 
B|18| M: [Right .] 
A|19| A: So . She [was] falling down [and] hemorrhaging _and , you_ know , all kinds [of] physical problems , _so_ _it_ _just_ became [too] much [for] me [to] handle , even though [I] [would] _have_ liked _to have_ [had] her stay , _with_ her health being what _it_ [was] _she_ _couldn't_ _anymore ._ 
B|20| M: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
A|21| A: [Yeah] . [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . 
B|22| M: [and we] [just] [couldn't] deal [with] [it] . 
A|23| A: [Oh] . 
B|24| M: [and , you] [, you] [got [to] have] [that] space [and [,] and] [time] [, [and] ,] uh [, you] [could] really _feel_ like [you] [were] _in the_ house . 
A|25| A: [Yeah] . 
B|26| M: _so ,_ 
A|27| A: Yes , well [, I think] sometimes when people get [to] [be] [a] certain age , other people [have] [to] [kind of] help them _make_ decisions . It sure wouldn't [have] been Granny's decision [to] leave _us_ [and] go back [to] [a] nursing home , but _she's_ accepted [it] real well now 
B|28| M: [Yeah ,] yeah [, I] don't [think] [she] feels like [she's] [a] whole lot [of] responsibility [anymore .] 
A|29| A: [so] . 
B|30| M: [I think] it's probably best _for us to_ [do] [that ,] _because_ [I think] [it] [would] [make] [a] lot [of] difference . 
A|31| A: Well , [we] enjoyed having her here , 
B|32| M: [Oh ,] [that] [was] wonderful . 
A|33| A: but [we] [feel] [she's] much safer where [she] is now . She still continues [to] fall , but when [she] does there , [a] nurse is right there [to] help her 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! translated [It's] really [a] good idea . 
A|35| A: [and] [I] know [she's] eating [the] right things [, and] her doctor's right there where he can come [in] [and] check on her , [so] . It became dangerous [for us to] keep transporting her back [and] forth [in the] car [because] [she] [was] [so] wobbly [and] needed [a] walker or [a] wheel chair 
B|36| M: Uh . Uh-hum . 
A|37| A: [so [,] I think] she'll adjust ,
