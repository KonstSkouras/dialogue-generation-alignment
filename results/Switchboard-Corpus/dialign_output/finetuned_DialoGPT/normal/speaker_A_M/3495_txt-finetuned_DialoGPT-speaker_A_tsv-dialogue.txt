A|34| A: [Yeah .] 
B|35| M: _so [,_ I] mean [, I don't] [, I] just [, I think] [I'm] getting old [, and] [I] don 't [like] [it] when kids [are] involved [in] _things_ [like] [that .] 
A|36| A: [Well] [, I think] [you] hit on [one] point [there] [is] [you know] each other . 
B|37| M: [Yeah] , well , it's [, it] [, it seems like] it's [pretty] steady . [I don't [know] [,] [you] , you] need _to keep up with_ [a lot of] _things_ [, I guess] . 
A|38| A: [I'm] , [I'm] [in a] neighborhood where [we] try [to keep up with] everything [.

It's [a ,] [in a] [nice] neighborhood [. The] houses here [, uh ,] before [the] recession were running two hundred thousand or [so] [and ,] course , everything's down ten [to] twenty percent now . 
B|39| M: Oh [, [I] see .] 
A|40| A: But [we have] [, uh ,] [one] , [one] [thing that] effects us [is] [we have] apartments [that are] probably about [a] half mile away [and] now [the] economy [is] bad [, they have] trouble keeping those full [so] [they've] dropped [the [,] uh ,] they're [not] nearly as selective as [they] used [to] be . 
B|41| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [And ,] course , that's [kind of] [like] [a] cancer [in] an apartment complex . You start letting [that] happen [and] [they] go down [and] then before [you know] [it] [you] [have] drugs [and] [a lot of] other [things] [so [,] uh ,] [I'm] sure [that] aggravates [it] also .
