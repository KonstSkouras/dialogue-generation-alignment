A|1| A: _Well ,_ there's _, uh_ , places _in_ Wisconsin . There's the Apostle Islands _, uh_ which are _in_ Bayfield which is [a] wonderful place . 
B|2| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|3| A: _And_ then there's also _, uh_ , what _we_ found _, uh_ , _in_ the state _of_ _, uh_ , South Dakota , the Black Hills . 
B|4| M: Oh _, I_ didn't _know_ _that ._ 
A|5| A: _And_ _we_ _just have_ this _, uh_ , really _good_ time _there_ . One thing is they don't _have_ mosquitoes _and , uh_ , sorry [to] say _, _and_ , uh_ , _in_ Wisconsin _we_ [do] _, so_ [, that] kind _of_ puts [a] little bit _of_ [a] hamper on your _, uh_ _, you_ [know] , if , if you're going _to go_ camping , who wants [to] deal with bugs _and , uh_ 
B|6| M: Oh _. Yeah_ . 
A|7| A: We found this one area [that] doesn't _have_ mosquitoes . They _just_ don't _have_ them _and_ it's _just_ wonderful not _to be_ bugged all night long with [a] humming mosquito at your ear , 
B|8| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|9| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . 
B|10| M: [And] we'd [have] [to go] _up_ [there] [, you] [just have] _to _get_ a_ [, you] [have] [to be] _sure_ [you] weren't [in] [a] hurry . 
A|11| A: Sure . [Uh-huh .] Sure . 
B|12| M: [and , uh] . 
A|13| A: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
B|14| M: _But [,_ uh] . 
A|15| A: That _was_ really called roughing _it_ , yeah . _I ,_ Anymore [. [Yeah] ,] see 
B|16| M: [And] _I , I_ _did [,_ uh] . 
A|17| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . [Uh-huh .] 
B|18| M: [and , uh] . 
A|19| A: Than [you] , [sure] . Than _it_ , _when_ [you] _were_ younger , uh-huh . 
B|20| M: [Yeah [,] and] [we] [were] real excited [when] [we] _got_ married [, and] [it] [was] _only_ [a] couple [of] weeks [, _so] ._ 
A|21| A: [it] , with kids they don't care if they take [a] shower everyday . With kids they don't care [, you] [know] [, uh] , [a] about [a lot] [of] things . [But] as adults [, uh] , it's [like] if [I] don't take [a] shower every day [, I] feel [like] [, you] [know] , ooh . 
B|22| M: [Well ,] that's [good] . 
A|23| A: [I , I] [just] don't feel right [so .] There's lots [of] places if you're going [to go] camping . K O A are wonderful . It's kind [of] it's kind [of] the [, uh] , yuppie type [of] camping because they [have] showers , they [have] things for kids [to do .] They [have] swimming pools , things [like] [that .] If [you] can find [, uh] , some really nice , clean [, uh] , campgrounds versus [, uh] , if [you] [go] [to] state parks [, uh] , 
B|24| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that .] 
A|25| A: [we] [have] found state parks , not [that] they're lacking but [, uh] , they're certainly not [up] [to] [a] standard [of] [a] K O A where it's [, you] [know] , [a] little bit cleaner . You've [got] the showers available . It's not [, you] [know] , [in] the same category . State parks [, you] [know] [, you] [get a] little bit fearful too [, uh] [, you] [know] , things [like] [that] simply because [it] , they are supposed [to be] patrolled but [, uh] [, you] [know] , it's , it's [a] little bit different . [But [,] so] we've always kind [of] stayed with [a] K O A [and] then [, uh] , [did] other things besides [just] sit at the campground at night . That's the [only] time [you] really use your campground . If you're going [to be] gone all day long , walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever [uh] , you're camping really is [just] for [like] [in] the evening [to] start the fire , [to] sit back [and] watch [a] fire [, uh] , [to] enjoy [that] [, you] [know] [, and] then [to get] [up] [in] the morning [and] [get a] shower [and] [get] cleaned [up] [, that] kind [of] stuff . 
B|26| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: So [we] never really spent [that] much time at the campground as much as [we] [did ,]
