A|5| A: _Uh , I_ personally _know_ nothing _about_ _the_ Peace Corps though . 
B|6| M: _No ._ 
A|7| A: _But_ _they_ _have_ _, I_ read somewhere _, and_ I'm , I'm _out_ on _a_ limb here , some type _of_ college _, uh ,_ volunteer work _for_ teachers _, that_ _they_ _are_ straight _out_ _of_ college _and they_ _do_ one year _of_ volunteer work teaching _in_ _the _,_ uh ,_ lower income brackets _of_ _the_ United States .

B|8| M: _Um_ .

B|10| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|11| A: _And_ _this_ _is_ money _that_ she's borrowed _to_ form her college education ? 
B|12| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|13| A: _But_ _she got_ credits _for it_ ? 
B|14| M:  !!! % _Yeah ,_ [she got] credit [for _it] ._ 
A|15| A: _That's_ very _interesting_ . 
B|16| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|17| A: _Huh ._ 
B|18| M: _But _,_ um_ . 
A|19| A: [Yeah _,] I think _that_ is_ _an_ excellent program _, I_ _really_ _do_ _. I_ _like_ _that _._ And_ _it's _,_ it's_ beneficial _to_ _the_ small towns _too_ _because ,_ _they_ _really_ _, really_ _have_ _, have a_ disadvantage _that_ we wouldn't understand _because_ we're _in_ _the_ Metroplex . 
B|20| M: Uh-huh . 
A|21| A: _Right_ _, _you_ know ,_ if , if we had some _really_ major health _problem_ _that_ required _a_ specialist , we could find one [it] wouldn't _be_ convenient , 
B|22| M: Uh-huh . 
A|23| A: but we could find one . 
B|24| M: [That's] true . 
A|25| A: We wouldn't _have_ _to_ drive _and_ spend _the_ night someplace or something _like_ _that ._ 
B|26| M: _Right ._ 
A|27| A: So _, I , I_ _can_ see _the_ advantage _to_ _that_ one . The Peace Corps itself _is_ _really_ _a_ _, uh ,_ _dying out_ , isn't [it] ? 
B|28| M: [Yeah [,] it's] [dying out] _as_ [far] _as_ [, uh] [you know _,] the_ training goes . 
A|29| A: It's still _in_ existence . 
B|30| M: yeah [, _and] [,_ uh] 
A|31| A: [I] _want to_ believe _they_ _go_ into _other_ countries [and] teach _them_ how _to do_ _things_ _like_ farm _, uh ,_ dig _their_ own wells , set up , _their_ schools . 
B|32| M: Uh-huh . 
A|33| A: Yes . They , 
B|34| M:  !!! % !! translated _It_ makes [them] self-sufficient , _right_ ? 
A|35| A: It's _not_ _a_ program _to_ teach _them to_ use [the] American money [, it's] _a_ program _to_ teach _them _to_ be_ _more_ self-reliant . 
B|36| M: _Right ._ 
A|37| A: _And_ , yes _, you're_ [right] _, _I think_ it's_ _a_ sixties program _. [I_ think] [it] was one _of_ Kennedy's hot points _that_ he _, that_ was his _big_ deal . 
B|38| M: Uh-huh . 
A|39| A: _Right . Right ._ [Um] _, I think_ _I ,_ I've singled [out] my grandchildren [and] but actually _they're_ , _they're_ pretty _good_ , along those lines [as] compared _to_ what [I] _have_ _seen_ from _other_ people's children [and] grandchildren , mine aren't _really_ _that_ bad , 
B|40| M: [Yeah] . 
A|41| A: but at _the same_ _time_ [I think] [it] _would_ _do_ [them] _a_ world _of_ _good_ . 
B|42| M: [Uh , [I] don't [know] [,] I [,] _it's] , it_ seems [to] me [that _,] uh , _the_ more_ [I think] [about] [it] [, uh] ... 
A|43| A: [But] there's _a_ , 
B|44| M: Well [, [I] don't know] . 
A|45| A: Mandatory _just_ _like_ , _like_ [the] draft . [No .] 
B|46| M: [I , I] agree _with_ [you] _there_ _. _I , I_ think [that_ [,] uh [,] [that] , that] [would] [be] _a good_ idea . 
A|47| A: Every _time_ [you] , They could buy _their_ way [out] . 
B|48| M: [Yeah] . 
A|49| A: [Right] _, [you_ know ,] _they_ , they'd figure [a] way around [that] one _in_ [a] heartbeat . [But ,] I'm wondering if there's another issue here [, and] maybe _this_ _is_ why _this_ has died [out] . Can [you] _go_ into [, and] _this_ wasn't [the] question but [it's , it] may _be [the_ more] _of_ [the] issue versus should young adults , _can_ _they_ _go_ _in_ [there] [and] _can_ anyone _go_ into , well , [out] _of_ [the] Kurdish community _is_ [a] little bit extreme at _this_ _time_ , but say [, I think] Bangladesh [would] _have_ been [a good] example or some , some _really_ desperate situation [and] teach _them to_ farm [and] teach [them] [and] [it] doesn't _do_ any [good] . 
B|50| M: Uh-huh . 
A|51| A: [I don't know] [that] [it] does [. I [, I] ,] [don't know] [that [,] um] , if [you] step back from [the] current issue [and] look at [it] [more] intellectually , _there are_ forever over , [as] long [as] we [know] _there are_ races _of_ people [that] _are_ dropping [out] . 
B|52| M: Uh-huh . 
A|53| A: You [know ,] we're losing certain , races _of_ people . 
B|54| M: [Right .] 
A|55| A: There _are_ people now [that] _are_ obsolete point [and] fact _just ,_ _just_ _like_ endangered species _of_ animals , _so_ _there are_ quote tribes _of_ people [, that] _are_ endangered or obsolete . 
B|56| M: [Huh .] 
A|57| A: _And_ I'm _just_ wondering if _you're_ fighting [a] natural process [there] _of_ being winnowed [out] . There's [a] German word [for it] _that's_ elegant , but [I] never _can_ remember what [it] was [, uh ,] but , but [that] _they're_ , _they're_ being winnowed _because_ _they're_ , where _they_ _are_ _they're not_ adapted [to] _their_ environment essentially . 
B|58| M: [Right .] 
A|59| A: [Um] [, and] one _of_ [the] quick examples _is_ [the] Aborigines . 
B|60| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that .] 
A|61| A: [Uh ,] when we were _in_ Australia [, uh ,] sad little _things_ . [Uh , I] felt sorry [for] [them] . Because _their_ society isn't [there] anymore [, and] _their_ belief system [and] _all_ _their_ structured [of] theirs , _all the_ structures [of] _their_ society _are_ gone , essentially . 
B|62| M: [Oh , really] . 
A|63| A: _And_ _they're_ _just_ kind [of] [more] _like_ [a] side show than anything else [and] _that's_ sad . 
B|64| M: Well [, I] guess [I] haven't [really] [seen] [too] much [of] [it] lately . 
A|65| A: [But] [I don't] [think] there's any way [you] could _go_ [, uh , the] Peace Corps could _go_ _in_ [and] rescue those people [, and] [I don't] [think] [you] could _have_ done [it] fifty or [a] hundred years ago either . 
B|66| M: _No ,_ no . 
A|67| A: So [, I ,] I'm wondering if [the] Peace Corps _is [,_ really] _an_ effective tool . 
B|68| M: [I don't know] . 
A|69| A: Good point . We've [got] _enough_ without without [a] passport there's plenty . 
B|70| M: Uh-huh . 
A|71| A: Yes [. [I] think] we ought [to] worry [about] our own species . 
B|72| M: [I think] [so] , [too] [. I [,] uh [,] I _think] the , the_ [other] _thing_ [that's] [interesting] [, uh] . 
A|73| A: [I] wonder now _in_ [, and] I've been [out] [of] school [too] long [to] answer _this ,_ but [I] wonder if [there] aren't some sociology courses . 
B|74| M: Well _, I , I think_ [there are] [. I [,] uh [,] have a] son who's graduating [, and] he's [not] even yet old [enough] [to] _, to_ even get involved . 
A|75| A: [That's] [the] last [thing] _you want_ [, _to] do_ . 
B|76| M: _and [,_ uh [,] you] [think] [of] [all the] [things] [that [,] [you] [want] [to] do] [, you] [would] [like] [to do] [in] your spare [time] . 
A|77| A: [Yeah ,] [that's] exactly [it .] 
B|78| M: [and] [they're _not] going to_ pay [for [it] [.] And [I think] it's] _going [to_ be] [a] [big] [problem] [for] [the] kids , [because [,] you're] encouraging [them to] rebel [, you] [don't [know] [,] you] [just [,] you] can't [do] [this] [and] [you're] _going [to_ do] [this [,] and] [you] [can] [not] [do] [that [,] and] _it's _not_ going_ [be [the] same] [for] [the] parents . 
A|79| A: They're [not going to] take [that] money [you] give [them] [and] _go_ try [to] figure [out] [a] way [to] dry [out] [with] [it .] Now come on , let's [be] realistic , 
B|80| M: Uh-huh . 
A|81| A: [that's] [just] [not] realistic . 
B|82| M: Well [, [that] , [that] [is] [,] that] [would] [be] [an] [interesting] concept . 
A|83| A: [Right .] 
B|84| M: [and] then , then [they] [can] [go] [out] [and] [do] [their] [thing] [and they] [can] make [themselves] wealthy . 
A|85| A: [No ,] we're [not] [I don't] [think] [. [I] think ,] [that's] [more] realistic than making [them] [go] [in] [the] Peace Corps . 
B|86| M: [Yeah] . 
A|87| A: [I think] [that's] [a] lot [more] realistic . [Uh [, [I] , I think] that] we should [be] spending [more] [time] [and [,] and] again [I don't] [think the , the] Peace Corps [is ,] [is] [as] successful now simply [because] [it's not] . [It] doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|88| M: [Right . Right .] 
A|89| A: [Uh ,] we've [got] plenty , [in] fact , we've [got] [far] [too] many . You're [in] [, uh ,] what Flower Mound ? 
B|90| M: Uh-huh . 
A|91| A: [I] was , [that's] exactly what [I] was [going to] ask [you] . Have [you] ever [, have] [, have] [you] been downtown
