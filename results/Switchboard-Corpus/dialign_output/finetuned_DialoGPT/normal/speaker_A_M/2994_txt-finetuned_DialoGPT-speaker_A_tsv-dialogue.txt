B|0| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|1| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah] my husband was complaining the other day _because_ he said every time _I_ turn around you're telling me _some_ new rule _about_ _recycling_ like yesterday _I_ was tell him , _you_ have _to_ , you're supposed _to_ squeeze the _plastic_ jugs before _you_ _take_ them up _there ._ 
B|2| M: _Right ._ 
A|3| A: Every time he turns around _I'm_ giving him _some_ new rule , where you're supposed _to_ squish up the , _you know_ , like collapse the _plastic_ jugs . Instead _of_ taking them up _there_ solid . 
B|4| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _And_ _I_ wish _that_ our _recycling_ center took paper _bags_ . They won't _take_ _those_ . We like _to_ _put_ our , just _put_ our newspapers _in_ _a_ paper bag , _you know_ _, and then_ carry them up _there_ _that_ way . 
B|6| M: [Yeah .] 
A|7| A: _And_ _we_ have _to_ bring the paper _bags_ back every time . Because they won't _take_ them . 
B|8| M: Oh . 
A|9| A: Do _you_ _, uh ,_ _take_ _your_ _papers_ somewhere or does someone pick them up ? 
B|10| M: No _, _I_ _don't_ take_ _any_ _of those_ [papers] . 
A|11| A: [Uh-huh .] We , um , _we_ [don't take] our _cans_ up _to_ _that_ center , though , our aluminum _cans_ , _we_ like _to_ [take] them _to_ one [of] the _places_ where they pay _you_ for them . 
B|12| M: _Right ._ 
A|13| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|14| M: _but_ [we] _do_ [take] [cans] . 
A|15| A: [Yeah] , _it_ takes us _about_ _a_ year _to_ save up enough _to_ _be_ worth , _you know_ , worth bothering _to_ go _in_ _and_ [do] , [but] . Do _you_ , um , have [any] ideas on anything _that would_ make , 
B|16| M: Well _, _I_ don't know_ . I've always , I've never [, uh ,] thought [about] getting involved [in] [any] type [of] [recycling] [, uh] . 
A|17| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|18| M: [And] [, uh [,] _and] I_ [know] [some] [places] will [take] [, uh] newspaper [, and] they'll also [take] [plastic] _bags [,_ and] [, uh] [you know] . 
A|19| A: [Right .] 
B|20| M: [and] [, and _then] you_ [put] [it] [in] [your] regular trash . 
A|21| A: [Yeah] _that would be_ _a_ _good_ idea . 
B|22| M: Uh-uh _. I_ mean _, _I_ , I think_ _, I_ [know] [that] [there] _are_ _a lot_ _more_ _people_ [that] use [plastic] . 
A|23| A: [Yeah .] 
B|24| M: [And] [I'm] _not_ sure _how_ _you would_ [, uh ,] _how_ you'd route getting [there] [and then] getting [it] [there .] 
A|25| A: [Right .] [Yeah] _, that would be_ [a] real _good_ motivation for [people] . 
B|26| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|27| A: [Right .] [Yeah] , my father was telling me [about] [some] program he read [about] where [you] buy [your] [bags ,] like [you] buy [your] garbage bag from the city , 
B|28| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|29| A: [and] [you] pay [more] than just what [you would] pay for an empty garbage bag [but] [then you] [don't] pay [any] monthly fee or anything , so [how] ever many [bags] [of] garbage [you] _throw_ _away_ _, that's_ [how] many [you] have _to_ pay for . 
B|30| M: Oh [, that] sounds [good] . 
A|31| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah] _that would be_ [a] real [good] idea . [I'm] trying _to_ [think] if there's anything else [I] could [think] [of] . They [are] talking [about] going _to_ curbside pickup [in] our , [in] our city . 
B|32| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|33| A: Rowlett , Texas . 
B|34| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|35| A: Do [you know] where [that] is ? 
B|36| M: [Yeah .] 
A|37| A: [And] [I don't know] if they decided _to_ [do] , or [not] , [but] [I think] they said [it] was going _to_ add like either [a] dollar or three dollars [a] month _to_ [your] bill _to_ have them [do] [that] . Although [, I think] [a lot] [of those] programs can operate at [about] [a] break even , break even point , without charging [people] . 
B|38| M: [Yeah .] That's true . 
A|39| A: [Yeah] [I don't know] [, uh [,] I] guess [it] just depends on [how] they manage [it] . 
B|40| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|41| A: [I don't know] [how] much they get when they sell all [that] stuff . The center [that] they've got now where [you] [take] [your] stuff [in] [I , I think] [that] should _be_ making [some] money . Since they just have _to_ hire someone _to_ man [it] [a] few hours [a] week . 
B|42| M: Well [, that's] [, _that] [,_ that would be] [good] . 
A|43| A: [And] they sell [, I] guess they sell everything _to_ [some] waste company [that] comes [and] gets [it] . 
B|44| M: Well [, that's] true . 
A|45| A: But [I] wish [that [,] uh ,] [more] [of] the [cans] , [you know] , like the [cans] [you] buy vegetables [and] fruit [and] stuff like [that] [in] were recyclable [. [I] don't] , [a lot] [of] [that's] [that] recyclable steel [and [I] don't know] anybody [that] takes [that] . 
B|46| M: [Right .] 
A|47| A: my husband likes Pepsi [and] [those] [cans] [are] steel instead [of] aluminum , so [we] can't , can't ever recycle them [. [I] think] it's [a] [good] reason _to_ quit buying [it] . 
B|48| M: [I don't] [think] [it] [would be] [any] better , [because] [you] wouldn't [be] able [to] [throw] [it] [away] . 
A|49| A: [Yeah] [, that's] what [we] buy the most [of] , unless we're going on [a] trip or something where [we] want [to] , [put] the [cans] [in] [a] cooler 
B|50| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|51| A: But , well [that's] all [I] can really [think] [about] for [recycling] . 
B|52| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|53| A: It was [good] talking [to] [you] . 
B|54| M: You too . 
A|55| A: [Uh ,] bye .
