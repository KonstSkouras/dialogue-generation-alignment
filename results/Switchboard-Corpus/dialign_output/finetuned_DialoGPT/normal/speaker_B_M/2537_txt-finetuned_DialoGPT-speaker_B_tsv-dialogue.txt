B|39| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|40| B: _But , uh_ , [it's] , [it's] still , _it ,_ _it_ still remains [a] tough question [and] , [it's] , there's [a lot of] [, you know [,] the whole] [, the whole] department [of] defense [, uh] , reasoning behind [the] original plan [and] whatnot .

B|41| M: Uh-uh . 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| M: [you know [, I don't] know _,] [there_ _,] there_ might [be] [a] [point] [where] [it] _would be_ necessary [but [I] think [,] I'm not] sure [that] [it] [would] [do] [much] [of a] [much] [of] [anything] . 
A|44| B: [I] _really_ [don't] [think so [.] Yeah _.] I_ _really_ [don't] because , [some] people are going to , are , are going to risk _it ,_ um , [it] may prevent [, [I] , I] guess [, I] guess [what] [I'm] trying to get at [is] , if _it ,_ if _it ,_ if [it] does help [a] few individuals maybe , maybe [it's] worth _it ._ 
B|45| M: [Uh [,] I don't know ,] [I've] [, I] haven't [had] [any] real serious problems [with it [.] I] don [, I] live [in] [a [,] I'm] [a] _college_ student [, and] [so] [I'm not] real familiar [with [it] ,] [so] [I] haven tought _too_ [much] about [it .] [But , uh] .

There , there's still [a] big question [in] my mind _that [,_ [the] , the] absolute refusal to accept [the] possibility [of] , [of] mistakes _on_ [the] testing , [is] something [that] still bothers [me] . 
B|47| M:  !!! ; !! % !! Remind [me] [of] [that ,] uh-homing .

A|50| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| M: [I] [would] [just] feel [really] [upset] , [you're] [right] [, you] can't [trust] [anybody] . 
A|52| B: [Uh-huh .] Absolutely . _And_ [that [,] [I] [, I] don't know] if [, uh] [, I don't know] if everybody understands all [the] implications _on_ [that] [too] . even if _you [, you_ know ,] if [you] take [, uh] , [a ,] [a] [drug] [that] was prescribed for [you] [but] [the , the] prescription has run out [you] still [had] [some] left [and] [you] happen to take [an] extra penicillin , well , penicillin's [not] _on_ [the] list [but] [, you know ,] 
B|53| M: [No] . 
A|54| B: yeah [, [I] [, I] think] [you] understand [what] [I'm] getting at , 
B|55| M: [Uh ,] 
A|56| B: [it ,] [it] _can_ still show up [and] [it] _can_ still flag as [a] positive [and] [, and] those kinds [of] [things] obviously [that's] [not] [the] intent , 
B|57| M: Uh-uh . 
A|58| B: [and] [, uh] , those are [the] kinds [of] [things] [that] still _can_ show up . 
B|59| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|61| M: [so] [you] can't [, you know , that] can't [be] used [against] [you , you] [can [,] you] [could] [use] [it] [against] [your] spouse , [but] then you'd [be] equally matched [against] [someone] [else] [who] [is] using [it .] 
A|62| B: [That's right .] 
B|63| M: [And , uh] 
A|64| B: [That's right [.] I] even [had] [friends] when [I] was going to [college] [who] were [in] [, uh] , pharmacy school [and] [they] [could] legally , um , provide medicine to their family family members [and] [friends] certain medicines were , were legal [now] [I , [I] , I] believe [, you know ,] [any] [of [the] ,] [any] [of the] ones we [would] , we [would be] tested for wouldn't [be] _on_ those lists , 
B|65| M: Uh-uh [. Right .] 
A|66| B: [but] [, uh] , um [, there] were certain [things] [that] [they] [could] provide without [a] doctors prescription based _on_ their qualifications [and] [, that] [can] happen . 
B|67| M: [Yeah .] 
A|68| B: [But , uh] , 
B|69| M: So , what's [your] opinion [on] [it] ? 
A|70| B: [Yeah ,] yeah [, [I think] so]
