A|2| B: Right . 
B|3| M: _so_ , 
A|4| B: _Oh_ . Right . Over here , [they] _, uh ,_ [have] several private companies _that_ you can take _, uh ,_ recycled , materials _to_ . _But , uh ,_ if you want _to_ take them all _to_ [one] place , [they have] _, uh ,_ [the] first Saturday _of_ every month , [they have] certain places _that_ you can drop them off . That's what _I_ _do_ . _Uh _,_ _and_ _I_ , I_ recycle aluminum , glass _, uh ,_ newspapers . 
B|5| M: Uh-oh . 
A|6| B: _So_ _it's_ nice _to_ [have] , you _know ,_ [one] place _that_ you can take them all _to_ instead _of_ driving [the] glass _to_ [one] place 
B|7| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| B: Right . _So_ _it's_ , [so] _that's_ nice . It would be , _it_ would be really nice if [they] _, uh ,_ came _to_ [the] house _to_ pick _it_ up [and they] just were talking about _a_ bill in Tucson about _that_ _, but_ _, uh _,_ uh ,_ _it_ didn't go through . 
B|9| M: [Oh] [, I] see . 
A|10| B: Right _. _I_ guess_ what [they] , what [they] were talking about here was _, uh ,_ was reducing [the] garbage collection in order _to_ make _that_ up or something , you _know ._ 
B|11| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|12| B: _Uh ,_ [so] _I guess_ _that's_ [one] option . 
B|13| M: [But] [I] think [that's] [a] bigger waste . 
A|14| B: _I guess_ [one] thing they're working on now is _recycling_ plastics too . Like [, uh] 
B|15| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|16| B: [have] you noticed _that_ on [the] bottom _of_ plastic goods , [they have] this _little_ number now _that_ tells what _kind of_ plastic _it_ is ? 
B|17| M: _Yeah ,_ they've started [to] [do] [that] . 
A|18| B: _Yeah _, I_ guess_ [the] problem _with_ plastic is there's [so] many different kinds [that] you can't recycle , you can't just throw all plastic into [one] recycler . 
B|19| M: [Uh ,] 
A|20| B: [Yeah .] _So_ now they're like marking _, uh ,_ they're _, I don't know ,_ there's six , seven , eight different _kind of_ plastics [and they] , [they] mark on [the] bottom what _kind_ _it_ is . 
B|21| M:  !!!!,!! You're kidding . 
A|22| B: _So_ _I guess_ [that] makes _it_ easy [to] recycle [and] then they're , they're _, uh ,_ trying [to] make plastic goods [that] _don't_ [have] [a] bunch _of_ different plastics in them , you _know ,_ [that] are , [that] are only made out _of_ [one] _kind of_ plastic [so] [that] [that] makes _it_ easier _I guess_ . 
B|23| M:  !!!!,!! iful !! 
A|24| B: Right . 
B|25| M: [and] [, uh] . 
A|26| B: Where does your friend go [to] [to] recycle ? 
B|27| M: [Uh ,] he goes [to] Garland High [, and] he , he has [a] [recycling] center [, but] [it's] not big enough for [, uh] 
A|28| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| M: [but] she also [, uh] . 
A|30| B: [Yeah .] 
B|31| M: [But , uh] . 
A|32| B: [Yeah .] 
B|33| M: [But , uh [,] I don't know _,] I guess ,_ I've [kind of] gotten used [to] [it] [and I] don [, I] mean [, I] haven't [, I] never tried [to] [, uh] 
A|34| B: [I guess] [that's] how [it] gets passed on . You [know ,] when [one] person , you hear from another person 
B|35| M: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
A|36| B: [and] then [, uh [,] and] then you [, and] then you pass [it] on . 
B|37| M: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
A|38| B: It seems [to] be catching on [, uh ,] slowly [but] surely [, I guess] 
B|39| M: [Yeah , I] [know [.] [I] , [I] [,] uh] . 
A|40| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: He's , he's [a] [little] boy [with] [a] , [with] [a] beard [and] [a] beard . 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] Wow , [that's] cute . That's neat [, yeah .] When you ,
