A|0| B: Yes . Yes . 
B|1| M: _Well _,_ that's_ _good_ . 
A|2| B: Yes _, well ,_ _they were_ , _they_ _really_ wanted something teeny tiny _, and_ _I_ _, uh _,_ really_ wanted _that_ retriever's disposition . _Uh ,_ the ultimate _to_ tolerant , trainable disposition , 
B|3| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|4| B: so _I_ called four or five dog trainers because _I don't_ like the _little_ _dogs_ . 
B|5| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| B: _And _,_ and_ _I_ asked them _, you know ,_ _these_ _are_ the ages _of_ the kids , what _do_ _I_ get . _And they_ _all_ said , _Golden Retriever_ _and_ _I_ said okay , put _it_ under twenty pounds . _And_ the only thing _that_ _they_ could come up with _was_ _a_ Bichon Frize which _is a_ , 
B|7| M: [Uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|8| B: Do _you know_ what _that_ _is_ ? 
B|9| M: No . 
A|10| B: They're _cute ._ They _look_ like an air headed let _me_ tell _you_ . They're calm , _they're_ _not_ yuppie , _they're_ trainable , _they're_ _, uh ,_ very personable _in a_ different way _that_ _a_ _Golden Retriever_ _is_ . They're _not_ dignified like _a_ retriever _can_ _be ._ 
B|11| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|12| B: _Yeah ._ So _how old_ _is_ your retriever ? 
B|13| M: She's _about_ eleven weeks _now_ _, but_ _she's_ _still_ [a] [little] puppy . 
A|14| B: [Well ,] actually _, you know [,_ that's] the _breed_ standard _for_ females . What _you_ , 
B|15| M:  !!! % !! ; !! RemindMe !! [And] [they're] [a] _purebred_ ? 
A|16| B: _yeah ,_ what _you_ see shown _and_ bred [now] as _Golden_ Retrievers , this _, you know ,_ plus eighty _to_ [a] hundred pound range . 
B|17| M: _Oh_ . 
A|18| B: _That is not_ _breed_ standard . 
B|19| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] _. [That_ is not] _a _breed_ ._ 
A|20| B: Fifty-five [is] the minimum [but] _they_ usually run [about] sixty _to_ sixty-five . [And] the ones _that_ _are_ shown , _they_ _are_ inside _that_ weight allowance . 
B|21| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _You_ cannot show your retriever _if_ _it's _,_ you know _,_ a_ hundred plus pounds . 
B|23| M: Right . 
A|24| B: So _don't_ say [she's] small , just say [she's] perfect . 
B|25| M: [Yeah] [, well _,] I_ think [she's] real [cute .] 
A|26| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|27| M: [And [,] uh ,] she has [a] dark nose , blackened nose _, and , uh_ 
A|28| B: Yep . 
B|29| M: _But_ [she's] , she [is a] _good_ example [for] young _people_ [to] [look] _for ,_ too . _Because_ [, you know _,] if you_ want _to be_ [a] _good_ [, a] _good_ parent [, you] [can] _always_ learn _to be ._ 
A|30| B: [Well ,] _they_ _are_ , _they_ _are_ the ultimate dog [to] have around kids so long as your kid [is not] scared _of_ [a] big dog , because [I] had [a] retriever , actually [I] had [a] retriever Irish Setter cross . Which [is a] _really_ nice animal 
B|31| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|32| B: [and] fortunately _it was_ just like [a] retriever [and] then I've had [a] retriever . 
B|33| M: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|34| B: It _was_ gorgeous . It _was_ just gorgeous . [I] mean just gorgeous . Um [, and] _they_ both [, you know ,] both the half [breed] [and] the pure [breed] had the [, uh ,] what [I] consider the , the , the perfect disposition . [But] [you know] what [, you know] what scares [me] [about] _Golden_ Retrievers ? Since they've become so popular [you] get what [I] call backyard breeders . Which [is] probably where yours came from . People _that_ _don't know_ what [they're] doing [, and] _they_ [breed] them [, you know ,] [for] [a] certain characteristic . [And] _in_ the retrievers _it_ happens [to be] _they_ like them big , [for] somehow big [is] perceived as the better . [And] when [you] start doing _that_ [you] _really_ tamper with [, you know ,] the , _all_ the , the years _of_ [, uh ,] culling litters [and [,] and [, uh] [,] you] tamper with what the dog innately [is] . 
B|35| M: [Uh-huh .] Uh-hauhuh , uh-hue . 
A|36| B: We when [I] _was ,_ when [I] bought my last [purebred] retriever [I] mean [I] looked _all_ over because [I] wanted one _that_ [still] looked like [a] retriever [, you know ,] the short [to] the ground , stocky , golden [, uh ,] trainable , tractable , quiet animal _that_ could hunt [and] [still] [be] _in_ the house . 
B|37| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [And] [I] ended up getting one _that_ [, uh ,] came out _of_ [a] [, a] [, a] hunting stock because [I] wanted one _that_ could [still] perform like [a] retriever did . 
B|39| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| B: [And] I've seen an awful lot _of_ lately _really_ dumb , dumb retrievers [and] I'm [, and] [I] _really_ fear [for] the [breed] because [I] love _that_ [breed] , 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] 
A|42| B: [but] [I] _really_ figure right when _it_ becomes _really_ popular _that_ _it's_ going [to be] ruined . 
B|43| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| B: [Oh , yeah .] _You_ bet [you] . _You_ bet [you] . _You_ [know] _how_ _they_ came up with the retriever , _don't_ [you] , the _Golden_ ? 
B|45| M: [Uh [,] [yeah] [,] _and] [it's_ ,] [it's] [a] [purebred] [Golden Retriever] . 
A|46| B: It _was_ bred out _of_ several different retrievers [, and] _they_ bred _it_ [for] companionship [and [, uh] [,] uh ,] disposition [and [,] and] ability [to] hunt . It _was_ kept only by kings . 
B|47| M: [Uh-huh .] [Oh [,] that's] interesting . 
A|48| B: [But] _they_ selectively culled those litters [, I] mean , [for] many hundreds _of_ years [and] since _it_ slept _in_ the castle with its master [, I] mean _it_ had _, it_ had [to be] _of_ [a] disposition [to] make _it [,_ you know ,] an animal [you] could keep around _that_ closely . [But] _they_ would go through _all_ the litters [and] destroy the puppies [if] _they were_ anything other than perfect . Now [, you know ,] _that_ seems like [a] cruel thing [to] _do_ . 
B|49| M: [Yeah .] 
A|50| B: On the other hand [, you] sure [, you know ,] _they_ sure created [a] [, a] wonderful [breed] [, I] mean [a] wonderful [breed .] 
B|51| M: [Well ,] [it's [,] [it] [,] [it] [was] [,] it] certainly [was [,] uh] 
A|52| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| M: [And [they] were] [all] purebreds . 
A|54| B: _Well , I_ tell [you] [, you know] the , the German shepherd [is] the classic case _of_ what I'm talking [about] because _in_ America [that's] called [a] Rin Tin Tin phenomena . 
B|55| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] _of that_ . 
A|56| B: Only _in_ America [is] there [a] dog called [a] German Shepherd . 
B|57| M: [Yeah .] 
A|58| B: [That] dog [is] bred out [of] three European _dogs_ . The Belgian Tervurien [, a] German Skutzhund [, and] [a] makes [a] [I] [always] forget the third one . [I] [can] see [it] . [Uh [,] uh [,] but] the third one [is a] children's dog . 
B|59| M: Okay . 
A|60| B: [And] there _are_ distinct breeds _in_ Europe . Now what happened over here [was] [is] [that] [people] saw the , the first , um , which would actually have been [a] Skutzhund which [is] what Rin Tin Tin [was] . 
B|61| M: Huh . 
A|62| B: [And] everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin . [And] [it was] known as [a] German shepherd here . So [they] created [a breed] standard . The American Kennel Club did . 
B|63| M: Huh . 
A|64| B: [That] said anything [that] [is a] Skutzhund [, a] [, a] Tervurien [and [, uh] ,] Alsatian [that's] the other one . Alsatian , any inner breeding [of that] [can] [be] called [a] German shepherd here . 
B|65| M: Huh . 
A|66| B: [And] what happened [is] , [is] [that] [people] wanted this shepherd [to] shepherd [and] protect . [And they] bred [a] dog [that] [I] [it's] called [a] , an animal's critical span which basically translates [to] _how_ much shit will [it] take before [it] bites [you] [. That] German shepherd , the American German Shepherd here [was] [a] [, a] [, a] such an unreliable animal [that] the American Seeing Eye Institute refused [to] use them , because [they] would turn on on their handlers . 
B|67| M:  !!! % !! translated !! ; !! translate !! translation !! [You] can't [do] [that] [in a] school . 
A|68| B: [And] even , um [, uh ,] police corps which started [, you know ,] finding other breeds [to] use because this thing , this , this thing known as [a] German shepherd here , its personality [and] its dependability [and] its reliability [was] just terrible . So [about] fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club [of] America decided amongst themselves [that] [they were] going [to] change this . So [they] went back [to] Europe [and] brought back some [good] examples [of] each [of] the three breeds [and] bred [to] [a] standard what [they] wanted an American German shepherd [to be .] Which [is a] very heavily [now] Skutzhund [and] Alsatian , 
B|69| M: [Uh ,] [how old] [are] [these] [dogs] ? 
A|70| B: [and it's] the Alsatian [that's] the kid's dog . It's just [, you] see them [in] Europe [and] [they're] just lovely . 
B|71| M: [Well , [I] [don't] [know] [,] uh] . 
A|72| B: [But] you'll see [, I] mean [, if you] ever start looking [in] papers [now] [and] [you] start seeing [these] ads [for] German Shepherds , [they] will say on them , bred [for] disposition , A K C conforming which means [that] their advertising [that] this [is] no longer an indiscriminate dog . 
B|73| M: [Uh] . 
A|74| B: This [is] bred [for [,] and] [they] had [to] go through [and] destroy [a] , [for] [a] while there , [about] seventy-five percent [of] their puppies [that] [they] bred . 
B|75| M:  !!!!,!! ; !! % !! Remind [me] . 
A|76| B: [Because] [they were] looking [for] this disposition . [And] nowadays [you] , you'll get , you'll get [a] dog trainer [to] recommend [a] specific [, you know ,] breeder handler . They will recommend their shepherds as [a] children's dog . 
B|77| M: [Oh [,] really] ? 
A|78| B: [But] ...
