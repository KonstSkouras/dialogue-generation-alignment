A|50| B: [Uh] [yeah] 
B|51| M: [And] [I] [, [I] think] [I] _agree with_ _that ._ 
A|52| B: [but] here again [I] [go] back [to] [the] second amendment _You_ can disagree by [freedom of speech] which , has nothing _to do_ [with] action . 
B|53| M: Right , [right] . 
A|54| B: Now [I] am [I] am adamantly _against_ [that .] 
B|55| M: Uh-hum . 
A|56| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [And] [they] keep fighting each other [and [I] think] _that's_ [just] [what] [they] need [to do] [and [I] don't] [think] [it's] going [to] stop anytime soon . 
A|58| B: huh .

A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [I mean] [, [I] don't] [know] [what] I'd [do] [if] [it] _was_ someone [I] knew _was_ oppressing [me] . [But] [, [I] mean] [, it's] [just] [, [I] think] [I] [would] [be] scared [to] death [of] [my] [own] family [, [you] know] . 
A|66| B: [Well] here again [we] [uh] even though [you] [uh] physically [you] [agree with] [me] [you] [you] wouldn't [do] [it] yourself . 
B|67| M: [No .] Not at _all_ . 
A|68| B: Nevertheless [you] maintain _that it's_ _it is_ [the right] [of] [of] [any] citizen [to] burn [the] symbol [of] their [country .] 
B|69| M: Uh-uh . That's [right] . 
A|70| B: [Uh ,] um _so_ [long] as [it's] their possession . Ok _, you're_ [you're] [that's] fine [up] [to] there except [that] [uh , what] [that] [flag] symbolizes [is] [uh uh] [is] this [country] , 
B|71| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [and I] used [to] [know] as [a] Boy Scout [but] [all] [I] remember [was] [the] red [in [the] flag] represented [the] blood [that] [was] shed [to] [to] create this [country] _, and_ [to] maintain _it ._ 
B|73| M: Oh , uh-huh . 
A|74| B: _And [,_ _to] me_ [that's] [uh uh] black eye [to] every man [that] [ever] [uh] carried [a] weapon [or] killed [for] his [country .] 
B|75| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|76| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [but I] don t [mind] [if] they're going [to] get convicted [of] [, uh [,] [you] know] , sexual offenses [and] stuff [like] [that] [and I] don [think] [that] [they] _should be_ allowed [to] [, you] can't [, you] could not sentence them [to] life without possibility [of] parole . 
A|78| B: It's It's very easy [to do] . 
B|79| M: [Uh [,] [and] [I] think] [that's] [one] [thing] [that's] good [about] [it is] [that] [, uh [,] [you] don't] [have [to] be] [so] , uh-honed out [, [you] know] ,

B|83| M: Uh-hue . 
A|84| B: [Uh-huh .] Huh _. Well_ tell [me] has [it] [ever] [been] decided when when [is a] [uh] fetus [a] human ? 
B|85| M: [Well [,] I] [, I] [know] [that] [I have] heard [, [uh ,] uh] 
A|86| B: Huh . 
B|87| M: [And [,] uh , [I] think] [, [I] mean] [I] don t understand [the] idea [of the] father [or] [the] mother being [the one] who ultimately decides what's going [to] happen . 
A|88| B: Or [they] [on] their within [the] [own] [uh] society [, it] can vary . 
B|89| M: [Yeah [.] [Well] , it's] [, it] [, it] seems [to me] [that] [, uh ,] [that it's] [just] [, it] [was] [a] convenient way [to] get [away] from having [to] [go] through [so] many generations [of] [, of] [, [uh] [uh] [,] of] history before [you] could really say [, well [,] [you] know] [, you] can't [have] [it] [any] [more] 
A|90| B: [Uh-huh .]
