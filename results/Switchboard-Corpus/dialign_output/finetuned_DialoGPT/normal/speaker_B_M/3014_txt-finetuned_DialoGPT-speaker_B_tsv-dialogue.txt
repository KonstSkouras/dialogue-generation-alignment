B|5| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|6| B: But [, uh] mine _was_ _a_ year old , 
B|7| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| B: _and_ _we_ [bought it] for _very_ functional purposes , 
B|9| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|10| B: _and_ _that_ _was_ _we_ [bought] _a_ station wagon . We wanted an economical _car_ _to_ operate , 
B|11| M: Right . 
A|12| B: _but_ _we_ wanted _one_ _that_ _could_ carry _a lot of_ equipment . So _, we_ chose _a_ Nissan Stanza wagon . 
B|13| M: _Uh_ . 
A|14| B: [And] _I've_ never _been_ sorry , 
B|15| M: [Well ,] _that's_ nice . 
A|16| B: however _the_ need for _that_ kind _of_ _car_ has changed now , 
B|17| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|18| B: _and_ [, uh ,] while _it is_ still _good_ _, and_ it's quite serviceable _, and_ I'll drive [it] until [it] no longer _is_ reliable . 
B|19| M: _Uh _,_ well _,_ _that_ _,_ that_ sounds [like] _you _have_ a_ [very] [, uh] [uh ,] refined taste _in_ _cars ._ 
A|20| B: [And] probably then some I'll spend _a lot of_ time praying over [it] before [I] give [it] up . 
B|21| M: [Well ,] _that's_ _, that_ [is] _a good_ way [to] _do_ _it ._ 
A|22| B: _I think _that_ _I_ would_ _like _to_ ,_ _if_ _you know _,_ we_ all say , _if _I_ could_ [have] _the_ _car_ [I] always wanted _I would_ either _buy a_ Nissan Maxima [, uh ,] 
B|23| M: _Uh ,_ yeah . 
A|24| B: _I'm_ sold on Nissans . 
B|25| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|26| B: [I] [a] _or ,_ _or_ foreign [cars] actually . [Uh ,]

B|33| M: _Yeah_ , [I'm] sure [they] _would ._ 
A|34| B: But [I] had [, uh ,] had [a] Ford Escort [that] absolutely needed taps _the_ day _we_ _got_ [it .] 
B|35| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|36| B: [Uh _,] you know _, I_ mean_ [it] _was_ ready for _the_ graveyard . 
B|37| M: [Well , I] [know [,] uh] . 
A|38| B: [And] [I] spent as much on [that] _car_ [in] twelve months as [I] spent for _the_ _car ._ 
B|39| M: _That's_ right . 
A|40| B: So , 
B|41| M: [Well ,] _that's_ [a] pretty [good] deal . 
A|42| B: _and_ [that] _was_ just trying [to] hold us , getting out _of_ [that] _was_ _a used car ._ 
B|43| M: _Yeah_ , yeah _. Yeah ._ 
A|44| B: [And] [it] _was_ an older _car_ , 
B|45| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|46| B: _but _, you_ know ,_ Escort [is] supposed _to [have_ a] great track record as far as sales . 
B|47| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|48| B: But it's just , [it] just _was_ _not_ _and_ [you] get stung [a] time _or_ two ,

B|51| M:  !!! % !! RemindMe !! et !! Grammar !! _You_ !! LINE !! clamation !! _You_ !! xtended !! 
A|52| B: So [, I] just trusted _the_ CONSUMER REPORTS _and_ _the_ auto [, uh ,] reports 
B|53| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|54| B: had my son who knows _a lot_ about [that ,] study them thoroughly _, and_ he gave _me_ four choices _of_ [cars] [to] _buy_ 
B|55| M: [Uh] . 
A|56| B: An Escort _definitely_ _was_ _not_ among them . In fact , there wasn't an American _car_ [in] there . 
B|57| M: [Uh [,] uh] . 
A|58| B: [Uh ,] _the_ Nissan came _and_ _, and_ _we_ [bought] _the_ Nissan for functional purposes _not_ _what_ _the_ CONSUMER REPORTS said _we_ should get . 
B|59| M: Right . 
A|60| B: But [it] served our needs . [Uh ,] later on his reports , _the_ reports [that] he studied showed [that [, uh] ,] Nissan _was_ head _and_ shoulders above _the_ rest [in] _the_ [in] _the_ class [that] _we_ were looking for . [And] [that _,] and_ _I'd_ rather [have a] Maxima than [a] Cadillac _. I_ _really_ [would .] It's _not_ necessarily prestige , 
B|61| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|62| B: _but_ it's comfort . [Uh ,] there's _a lot of_ features on there [that] are desirable _if_ you're _going to_ pay [that] kind _of_ money for [a] _car ._ [Uh ,] 
B|63| M: [Well ,] _that's_ true [. [I] think] [, [I] think [that] [,] you know _, I] , _I_ do _like_ the_ looks [of] _those_ [. _I] don't_ [know] _why_ , _why_ [they] wouldn't _go_ _with_ _something_ _that's_ _more_ comfortable . 
A|64| B: Nissan . 
B|65| M: Nasaki . 
A|66| B: No . No , no . Nissan [is] Japanese . 
B|67| M: [Oh _,] _okay_ ._ 
A|68| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh , 
B|69| M: _Yeah_ , _that's_ [the] [one] [I] [was] thinking [of] . 
A|70| B: uh-huh . 
B|71| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] . 
A|72| B: [Yeah .] [And , uh ,] _if I_ couldn't [have] my luxury Maxima then _I'd_ _buy_ [me] [a] fancy little red C R X sports _car_ 
B|73| M: [Yeah] , yeah . 
A|74| B: _I mean [,_ you know ,] every every [one] [of] us [have] two sides 
B|75| M: [Yeah] , yeah . 
A|76| B: [Yeah .] Now _what_ about _you ,_ _if_ [you] _could_ [have] [the] _car_ [that] [you] wanted _what_ [would] [you] get 
B|77| M: [Uh _,] well _, I_ _, I_ don't_ [know , [I] think] [, uh] [you know] [what] [I'd] _really _like_ to have_ [is] _something that [I_ could] afford . 
A|78| B: _and_ [why] ? 
B|79| M: Why [not] [, and] [I think] _that's_ [what] [I would] _do ._ 
A|80| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| M: [I mean ,] [I'm] [not] saying [I would] [buy [a] new car] _but [I_ would] [definitely] [buy [a] used car .] 
A|82| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh [. Yeah .] See there , 
B|83| M: [and] [I like] [that ,] _too ._ 
A|84| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: [but [,] uh] . 
A|86| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh [.] I] tell [you] [that's] sad [too] because there [one] time Ford [was] [the] best [, that] [was] made . 
B|87| M: [Yeah .] 
A|88| B: Really [was] . 
B|89| M: _I don't_ [know ,] [but , [you] [,] you] [got] [to] look _at_ [the] history . 
A|90| B: [And , uh [, I] , I] [really] [have] [not] seen , now _a lot of_ [the] American [cars] actually are , are , parts are produced [in] foreign countries [and] assembled here _or_ vice versa . 
B|91| M: Right . 
A|92| B: Of course . 
B|93| M: _Okay_ . 
A|94| B: [Okay] [Uh ,] [at] any rate [do] [you have] color preferences _or_ [what] [would] be [the] features [that] [you] [would] be looking for ? 
B|95| M: [Well [,] uh] . 
A|96| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: Um . 
A|98| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh [. Yeah .] [Oh ,] wow . We [like the] _stuff_ [that] glitters 
B|99| M: [Yeah .] 
A|100| B: Good . There's nothing wrong [with] [that] . Actually [I think] probably _if I_ were _going to_ get _if I_ were _going to_ be practical , _which_ doesn't [mean] [I would] be [, [I] would] prefer white . Because , simply because it's [more] visible [at] night . 
B|101| M: Right . Right . 
A|102| B: [And ,] [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] Now [the] interior [, okay] [, I don't] care about [the] interior just as long as it's [not] black _or_ red . 
B|103| M: Uh-uh . 
A|104| B: But _if I_ had [the] little red C R X [, I] guess [the] interior [would] _have to_ be black leather [and] [I'd] _have to_ live [with] [that] . [And] _if I_ [got] [the] C R X [it] [would] _have [to_ [have] a] _real_ [good] sound system [in] [it] because [I'd] want [that] [too .] 
B|105| M: [Yeah .] 
A|106| B: [I'd] just [go] back [to] my teenage years [and] just throw all my experience [to] [the] wind 
B|107| M: [Uh ,] oh , yeah , yeah . 
A|108| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| M: so . 
A|110| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|111| M: [Well [,] we] [have _to] , uh_ 
A|112| B: [That's] [okay .] 
B|113| M: [I'm] [not] [going to] [do] [it .] 
A|114| B: No , no , no [. I] generally [would] [uh ,] prefer [to] _listen [to_ [, uh] [,] well _, I] listen to_ K C B [I] _a lot_ [but I] will _listen to_ [the] news [and] [the] [, and] [the] traffic [and] [those] things [at] work . 
B|115| M: Uh-uh [. Yeah .] 
A|116| B: But _if_ [I'm] [going to] be traveling [in] [that] [car] for any period [of] time [, I] want some _real_ [good] classical _music ._ 
B|117| M: [Yeah] , yeah . 
A|118| B: [I] love classical _music [,_ and] [you] just can't enjoy [it] unless you've [got] [a good] sound system [to] produce all [the] , all [the] characteristics [of] [the] instruments . 
B|119| M: Right . 
A|120| B: So [I do] love classical _music_ _or_ [it] _or ,_ _or [,_ uh ,] contemporary classical . 
B|121| M: [Well [, I] , [I] like] both kinds [of] [music [.] I like] [, I don't] [like the] [real] hard rock [or] [I] don [like the] [really] heavy metal [stuff] . 
A|122| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|123| M: [Uh [,] I don't] [, [I mean] [,] I listen to] [like the] Christian [music ,] [but I] don , [I'm] [not] sure [if [I] [like] the] [real] hard rock [or ,] 
A|124| B: Sure [do .] 
B|125| M: [And , uh] . 
A|126| B: W R R [and] [the] Oasis are [the] two [that [I] listen [to] ,] [more] than anything else . 
B|127| M: Uh-uh . [Well [, I] [,] I've] [been] listening [to] [a lot of] different [, uh ,] [new] [music [.] [I] don't] [know] [which] artist [it is] , [but [,] uh] . 
A|128| B: [And] [I do like] them . [And] [I'd] [like to [have] a] compact disc player [in] [the] [car .] That [would] be , [something that [I] would] [really like] . 
B|129| M: [Well ,] 
A|130| B: Those compact discs , [really] are [good] for [cars] because [they] [don't] melt , 
B|131| M: [Oh ,] [they] [do] ? 
A|132| B: [they] [don't] warp . 
B|133| M: [Oh .] 
A|134| B: [You] [know ,] there's nothing [in] there [that] can wrap around [the] , [the] [, uh ,] rollers [or] anything . It seems [like] [a] [really] [good] answer [to] portable [music [,] that] [you] can choose . 
B|135| M: Right .
