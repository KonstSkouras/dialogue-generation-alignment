A|38| B: [Uh-huh .] [Oh ,] no . 
B|39| M: [So _,] _I mean ,_ it's_ _really_ bad . 
A|40| B: [Oh] . 
B|41| M: [And] [it] _was_ _really_ [, uh] . 
A|42| B: Golly . 
B|43| M: _But_ [we] had power . We had four H P M here [in] McKinney . 
A|44| B: Are [you] serious ? 
B|45| M: _I mean [,_ you] _could_ _just_ [as] easily imagine [that] [they] had , had _, uh , a_ revolution .

B|47| M: _I don't_ [know [,] I] _, I mean _,_ I don't_ [, [I] know] _how [they_ live] [, but [,] uh [,] it] _just_ seems [like] [they] _, they_ _don't_ _really_ [have] _any_ power _. I mean_ [they] _just_ sort [of _,] they_ vote [and , uh] . 
A|48| B: _Yeah . I_ haven't heard [a] [thing] . 
B|49| M: _But_ [I know] [that] there's _been_ talk about _building_ [more] prisons . 
A|50| B: Lord . 
B|51| M: [And] [, uh ,] we've _, we_ _were _in_ the_ process [of] filling [in] _some_ forms [for] [our] [, uh] state . 
A|52| B: _Well [,_ that's good .] That's _great_ . 
B|53| M: [So [,] [it's] [,] [it] is a] [real] change . 
A|54| B: _Right ._ [Yeah .] 
B|55| M: _and , and_ [it's , it's a] [real] problem . 
A|56| B: _Right ._ 
B|57| M: [but [,] uh _,] they_ [do _,] they_ [have] [the] facilities _to do it ._ 
A|58| B: [and] [we] go along [and _,] I'm_ [really] _not sure_ [how] [we] find [the] individuals [, but] [we] find older _people_ [that] cannot afford [to] fix _up_ their homes [that] desperately _need_ [it _,] [and [,_ uh] [,] we] go along _with_ _all the_ material [and] [in] one _day ,_ [more] or less , go [in] [and] say , roof , paint , fix whatever [we] _can_ . 
B|59| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [Yeah [,] and] spend [a] _day_ doing [, that's] [really] _neat [. [I_ mean] , it's not] [a lot] because _you're_ [just] doing [a] house at [a] time [, but] [you know ,] every little bit _helps_ . 
B|61| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| B: [Uh [,] yeah .] They [, uh ,] luckily [we] _have [a_ , a] man who owns [a] [building] company . 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [So] he donates [a lot] , [not] everything [, but] [a lot _of] the_ material . Then _what_ he doesn't donate _we just_ go _out_ [and] buy . 
B|65| M: [Right .] 
A|66| B: [Yeah .] _And [it's_ not] [, you know [,] we] [don't] promote _it [a_ lot] outside [the] community because [we] [don't] _want_ recognition [for] [it , you know] _so much_ [as] _, we just want to_ help _people_ _out_ . 
B|67| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| B: [So] [it's] [real] [neat .] 
B|69| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [It's] , [Yeah ,] 
B|71| M: [And [it's] , _it's] _like_ [,_ uh ,] 
A|72| B: [it's like] [I] say [, it's not] [a lot] [, but] [it] _helps_ _people_ . Like _this_ last couple [we] helped [, you know [,] [they] [were] in] their eighties [and] _she_ [was] bedridden [and _,] I _just [,_ you_ know ,] [just] tears your heart _out_ [to] [to see] _this_ _kind of_ [thing] 
B|73| M: [Yeah .] 
A|74| B: [and] [you know ,] [if] _you can do_ [any] [a] little bit [, it] _helps_ , [so] 
B|75| M: [Oh [,] [I] know] [. I [know] [,] I _do] it [,_ too _. I] just_ _can't_ seem [to get] [over] [the] fact [that I] [need] _to do it _._ I don't_ [know] why [I] don trenches [. [I] do] [all the] [other] [stuff] . 
A|76| B: [Yeah .] 
B|77| M: [That] [helps] _a lot ._ 
A|78| B: [Yeah .] 
B|79| M: [and] [other] ones [did , _you] [,_ you] [just] had [to] meet [people ,] 
A|80| B: Gosh . That's _great_ . That's [a lot .] 
B|81| M: [So [,] I] [, [I think] _, _I] mean ,_ I'm_ [not sure] [, _you] ,_ [you're] [right [,] that] [the [,] that] _there_ [is a] [great] deal [of] responsibility [, and I _think] that [,_ [you] can] [see] where [that] comes [in] handy . 
A|82| B: That's [, that's] [a lot of] [kids [,] though .] 
B|83| M: [Yeah . I] [, [I] [know] [,] [I think] _that's] the_ only [thing] [I] [can] [think] [of] [that's [,] uh] . 
A|84| B: [Oh ,] well , still [that's] [a [,] you know [,] that's] [a good] chunk [of] [kids] . 
B|85| M: [Yeah .] 
A|86| B: [Yeah .] 
B|87| M: _and [, _and_ ,] [and_ it] [was] [just , _you] [,_ you] knew [, you] [were] going [to get] into [a] class [that] [was] going [to] be about [the] same [as] theirs . 
A|88| B: [Yeah .] That's [neat .] 
B|89| M: [So [,] that] [was] [kind of] [neat . I] [, I] [, uh] . 
A|90| B: That's [great] . 
B|91| M: [So ,] 
A|92| B: That's [great] . _But , uh ,_ [like ,] I'll _agree with_ [you [,] though] [, I don't] _think they_ should _have [to_ do] [a] year 
B|93| M: No [, I] [, I] [agree with] [that .] 
A|94| B: [Yeah [. I] don't] [think that ,] [some] [people] [I don't] [think] [have] [, uh , a] year [in] _them_ [to] volunteer [if] [you know] _what_ [I mean] . They're [not] worth [it] 
B|95| M: [Yeah] 
A|96| B: [Right .] [Oh [,] [yeah] [,] that's] true [, that's] true . 
B|97| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|98| B: [Oh] . 
B|99| M: [And] [she] _works_ _in the_ same [kind of] station [with] T V [, you] [don't] hear about [them] . 
A|100| B: [I] couldn't _either_ . 
B|101| M: [But , uh] . 
A|102| B: [I] couldn't _either_ . 
B|103| M: [Oh [,] I] [was] [just] thinking [that's what] _, that's the_ only [thing] [I] [can] [really] [think] [of] [that] [would] [really] be [a] crime [, you] wouldn't [know] anything about [it ,] 
A|104| B: [Right] , [right] . 
B|105| M: [And I think] [the ,] [the [,] and I [think] that] [the [,] I think they] [have a] very [, I don't] [know [,] I] [, I'm] [not] [really] [sure] [what] [the ,] [what] [the] quality [of [the] ,] [of the] products [they] put [out] [are] , [you're] [, you] [have to] wonder [, you] _can't [,_ you] [don't] [just] _can't_ tell . 
A|106| B: [Yeah [. I] just] [know] one person [that's] [in the] Peace Corps [and [,] I mean ,] she's [a] teacher [and , and] [just] wanted [to do it .] She'd [been] [a] teacher [for] [a] while . Just decided [she] wanted [to [do it] ,] [so] [. [I mean] , I'm] grateful [for] [people] [like] [that [,] but [,] I don't] [see] [how they] [can] [just ,] [Yeah ,] 
B|107| M: [I don't] [either] [, I think] there's [so much] pressure [, I just [,] I guess [,] you] [just] [have to] accept [that] there's [a] limit [on] , [on] [what] [you can do] . 
A|108| B: [just ,] pick _up_ [and] head [on] [out] . 
B|109| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| B: [I] wish [I] [could] [do] something [like] [that [,] but] [I] [can't ,] [so] 
B|111| M: [Well [,] [I think] ,] [I've] always considered [it a] hobby . 
A|112| B: [Right] [, that's the] [way] [I] am [. I know] [the] feeling . 
B|113| M: [But , uh [,] it's [a] lot of] work [, [I mean ,] I'm] [not] into sitting around [and] taping [up] [the] whole [day [,] you know] . 
A|114| B: That's [right] We're against [it] That's [right] . 
B|115| M: [Yeah .] 
A|116| B: [You] [, too] [, and I] hope everything [works] [out] [up] [there] . 
B|117| M: Okay .
