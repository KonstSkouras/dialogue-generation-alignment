B|27| M: What _do_ _you_ _think_ [about] _the_ , uh , _benefits_ [of] _the_ working _for_ [a] large corporation ? 
A|28| B: [Uh-huh [.] Well [,] I'm] [a] little different _than_ [other] people because [I don't] _have_ [benefits] with _my_ job .

A|30| B: [I'm] [a] nurse _and_ [I] _work_ ,

A|32| B: [I] float so _that I_ _have_ no [benefits] except higher pay [for] doing [that] . 
B|33| M: [Yeah .] 
A|34| B: So [I] find [that] _it_ makes up [for] what [I] pay [for] insurance _and_ [I , I] _make_ enough money by [the] hour [to] _make_ up [for] [that] . 
B|35| M: _Yeah ,_ _that's_ [, that] [, that] sounds [good] _to me _._ _I_ think_ _that's_ _really_ [a] , [a] [good] way _to do [it_ .] 
A|36| B: _Right ._ [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| M: [I don't] know . 
A|38| B: [Yeah ,] it's cheaper [for] [me] [to] buy insurance by [the] month _than_ [to] _work_ staff someplace . 
B|39| M: Uh-hums _. [Right_ .] 
A|40| B: [And] then [I] _have_ _my_ freedom [. I] can _work_ seven days _in_ [a] row _and_ take [a] week off or whatever [I] _want_ [to do] . 
B|41| M: Uh-hums . 
A|42| B: [Well ,] [it] is [to me .] Most people prefer [the] security [of] nine [to] five _, and_ weekends off _and_ knowing [that] their insurance is paid _and_ their retirement , 
B|43| M: [Yeah .] 
A|44| B: _and_ [I'm] [just] [really] _not_ _interested in_ [all] [that] . 
B|45| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| M: [I , [I] _, I] guess_ [I'm] [, I'm] more [interested in] what's going on [in] [the] world [than] what's actually happening . 
A|48| B: [Right .] 
B|49| M: [and] , uh . 
A|50| B: [Yeah [.] Right] _, and_ especially [if you] _have_ [a] family . 
B|51| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me .] 
A|52| B: Then [I think] [it] makes [a] big difference . 
B|53| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| B: [Yeah .] 
B|55| M: [And] , uh [, [I] don't] know [, [I] think] _that's_ [really] important .

A|58| B: [Oh ,] yeah . 
B|59| M: [and] [, and] , uh . 
A|60| B: [Right .] Could [you] change [that] as [you] _felt like_ [it] or did [you] _have_ [to do it] [the] same every week ? 
B|61| M: [Uh [,] I] [felt like] [I] could [make] [my] own schedule [and] [, and] [work] out [, and] , uh [I] found [that] , uh . 
A|62| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| M: [but] , uh . 
A|64| B: [Yeah .] 
B|65| M: [and] , uh . 
A|66| B: [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: [Uh [,] I've] got [to] [have] flexible hours . 
A|68| B: [Oh [,] well [, I] guess] , retirement [, that] kind [of] thing which [I don't] worry much [about] so 
B|69| M: [Yeah [,] that] [, that] would be [good] , [too] . 
A|70| B: [I just] prefer [to] worry [about] today , probably _not_ [a] practical attitude [but] [that's] who [I] am so , 
B|71| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| M: [And] [I'm] [not] sure [that I] would [want] [my] kids [to] go [to] day care
