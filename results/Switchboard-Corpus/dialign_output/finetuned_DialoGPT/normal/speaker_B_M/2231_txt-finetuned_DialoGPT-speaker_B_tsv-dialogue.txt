A|0| B: And _that _, that_ ,_ _the_ penalty _ought _to_ be_ _out_ there _, and_ _be_ enforced ? 
B|1| M: _Yeah _,_ I agree_ _. _I_ mean _,_ I don't _know_ ,_ I'm _, I mean_ I'm _not_ _for_ _it _,_ I_ _just_ _don't_ _think_ _it_ _should_ _, you know _,_ it_ _should_ stay _in_ effect . 
A|2| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|3| M: _But_ _, uh _,_ I think_ _it_ [ought _to] _,_ it_ [ought] _not_ [to be] _in_ _so_ few _years_ _. _I_ mean _,_ I don't _know_ ,_ I'm _not_ sure _what_ _the laws _are_ on_ [that _,] but_ _I think_ _they_ [ought _to] go_ . 
A|4| B: That's [, I agree] with [that] completely [. _I] know_ we [don't] _have_ enough prisons [, but] there has got [to be] _some_ kind _of_ punishment , For these _people_ . 
B|5| M: Right . 
A|6| B: Because if [they] turn around _, they_ _can_ _get_ away _, they get_ away with _it , _and_ _they_ get_ away with _it , _and_ _they_ get_ away with _it , and_ then _they do_ _something_ worse 
B|7| M: Right . 
A|8| B: _and _they_ get_ _a_ slap [on] [the] wrist . They _get_ , thirty days [in] jail 
B|9| M: Right .

B|11| M: Uh . 
A|12| B: And _it's _,_ _Well_ _,_ they_ certainly [are] living off our at our expense . 
B|13| M: Right . 
A|14| B: [I] didn't ,

A|18| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|19| M: _and _, and_ , and_ _you know ,_ _they're out_ _in the_ real _world_ [, and] _they're_ spending _so_ much money [and they] [have] no concept [of] _what's going_ [on] _, you know_ . 
A|20| B: And [, and] [be] paroled [, and] [and] [have] served [the] sentence , 
B|21| M: Right . 
A|22| B: _that's_ [what] _, that's_ [what] _people_ face with [that] choice .

B|23| M: Right . 
A|24| B: [that] [should] [be] life [, but ,] instead , [in] , [in] given [the] choice [of] either sentencing [to] death , or sentencing [to] life , they'll give them ninety [years] [in] prison or _something_ [, and] then turn around [in] thirty [years] _, that [,_ you know [,] and] less [they're out] . 
B|25| M: Right . 
A|26| B: Even if , if [they're] even [in] [that] long . Or [they] appeal [, and] then _they get_ an appeal [that] says _it was_ [, you know ,] an unjust amount [of] time , an extraordinary long length , or _something_ . 
B|27| M: Right . 
A|28| B: _Yeah ._ _I'd_ [like] _to see_ [the] death penalty more _as_ [a] deterrent [, I think] _people_ [know] [that] [nobody] _, that_ [it] doesn't [, you know _,] it's_ _not a_ deterrent right _now_ , because _it's_ _not really_ effective . 
B|29| M: No . 
A|30| B: There's [should] [be] [, you know ,] [this ,] [for] [this] crime , [this] _is_ [the] penalty _. You_ killed , someone [you know ,] [in] cold blood or whatever . 
B|31| M: Right . 
A|32| B: This _is_ [what's [going] to] _happen_ . 
B|33| M: _I _, I_ , I don't [know_ ,] I've , I'm [not] sure I'm _, I mean [,_ I] [see] [some] aspects [to] [it [,] but ,] [I'd] _, I would_ [say _that] I_ don [, I] wouldn't want [to see] [it [,] you] [, you] _have to_ [have] [a] _state_ [that] does [something] [like] [that] . 
A|34| B: And [, I mean [,] it] sounds horrible . It [, I] hear myself saying [this [,] and [,] but [,] I ,] [don't know] [what] else [to do] with [some] [of] these _people _,_ _that_ are ,_ 
B|35| M: [Well ,] [they're] [not] , 
A|36| B: because [they] let them back [out] again [, [and] _they] do_ [the] same _thing_ over [, and] over , again , 
B|37| M: [I know] . [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: then [they] put them back [in] jail [, [and] _they] _get_ out_ [, and] [and] more [and] more innocent _people_ [are] hurt or killed 
B|39| M: _Yes ._ 
A|40| B: [and] these guys [just] [are on] [the] endless merry-go-round [in the] legal system . 
B|41| M: _Yes_ [, [they] do] [, they] [are ,] [they're] [just] getting , 
A|42| B: And _it's_ [like] [I] said at our expense . 
B|43| M: [Yeah .] 
A|44| B: [Yes .] 
B|45| M: So [, [it's] [,] [it] [,] it] [can] [happen] [to] anyone [and] [it's] happened [to] me , _too ._ 
A|46| B: [I [know] [, I] , you] read [about] [it] [in the] paper , every day , somebody who's done [this ,] or [that ,] [something] [really] horrible 
B|47| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|48| B: [and they] [just] _get_ away with [it , and] nothing happens . 
B|49| M: Right . 
A|50| B: [Yeah [.] [I] think] [I think] Texas _is_ Texas , [the] southern states seem [to be] somewhat more conservative [and] still [have] [the] death penalty [, and [I] think] [, [I] know] California had [it] [for] [a] long time [, and] then _they [,_ uh ,] took [it] off [the] books [, they] repealed [it] 
B|51| M: Uh-hope . 
A|52| B: [and] _people_ [like] Charles Manson [, and , and] [some] [of] these _other people ,_ who were sentenced [to] death at [the] time [they] repealed [the] death penalty , were sentenced [to] life [in] prison [, and] [are] _now_ , _now_ [that] even though California has reinstated [the] death penalty , [for] whatever various crimes . The _people_ who were there originally , when _they ,_ when [they] changed [the laws] [to] revoke [the] death penalty , [are] still [in] there [for] , [are] [in] prison , [in] quote , [for] life [, and , and] [are] _now_ coming [up] [for] parole , [some] [of] them , [like] Manson who's come [up] [you know] 
B|53| M: Uh _, yeah ._ 
A|54| B: [it's] been denied fortunately [but ,] 
B|55| M: _Yeah [,_ that's] true . 
A|56| B: [Yeah .] 
B|57| M: [and] _it's _a_ , [a_ [,] [it's] [,] [it] _was] [a_ [,] you know [,] it] [is] [a] tough issue [, but [,] uh [,] you] [can] [see] [that] there's _a lot of_ [people] [that are [,] you] [just] _have to_ accept [it , and] [that's] [not a] bad [thing] . 
A|58| B: [Well ,] [the] jury [that] sentenced him , sentenced him [to] death 
B|59| M: _Yeah , yeah ._ 
A|60| B: [and] then while he [was] [on] appeal [on] his thousandth [and] one appeal , [the] [state] [of] California revoked [the] law [in the] early seventies [, and] then [they] reinstated [it] later [, but] [the] penalty didn't [go] back _. You_ [know] ? 
B|61| M: Huh . 
A|62| B: It _seems like_ [a lot of] times [the] law [is] , [is] totally [on] [the] criminal side [, and , and] isn't protecting [the] rest [of] [the] [people] . 
B|63| M: [Yeah .] 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] [not] [as] [, it] [seems like] [they're] [not really] making any effort [to] protect [the] victim . 
A|66| B: [Yeah .] And [the] , [the laws are] all , [the] rules . Some [of] [the] things [that] [would] make sense [to ,] [to] tell [the] jury _, that_ [this ,] [this] guy has [a , a] prior criminal history [, you know ,] where he's raped ten women 
B|67| M: Uh , 
A|68| B: [and] then he gets [up] [for] [this] one trial [, [and] they] [don't] finds anything [out] [about] [the] facts [that] he's done [this] over [and] over [and] over again 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that] [now] . 
A|70| B: [and] [so] [they] [say ,] well , [this] [is] [, you know [, I] , I don't know] if [they] [say] [it's] [the] first time offense or whatever [, but] [they] give him [a] lighter sentence , thinking he's [not a] habitual criminal . 
B|71| M: [Yeah .] 
A|72| B: [Yeah , yeah .] [Well ,] To [some] extent if [they] [would] [do] [something] with [some] [of] those [people] . [But] [that] [seems] [to be] [a] good way _to get_ off [for] [a lot of] them [too .] 
B|73| M: [I don't] [, I mean [,] [they] [,] they get] [so] easily swayed _by_ emotion . 
A|74| B: They plead insanity 
B|75| M: [Yeah .] 
A|76| B: [and] then three [years] later [they're] cured [, and] let loose [on] society again . 
B|77| M: Uh-hue . 
A|78| B: [I mean [,] [it's] a] [it's a] scary [world] [out] there anymore , where _your_ afraid [to [go] out] , 
B|79| M: Uh-hue . 
A|80| B: [I [know] ,] [in] , [in the] Dallas metroplex area [, I don't] [go out] hardly if [I don't] [have to] at night [by] myself 
B|81| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|82| B: [and I , I] certainly [, I , I] grew [up] [in a] smaller town [in] Texas [, and] [it] wasn't [that] way when [I] [was] younger . 
B|83| M: Uh , uh-hue . 
A|84| B: We could [go] around [, and ,] boy [and ,] 
B|85| M: It's [, [it's] [,] uh [,] it] [is] nice [to [get] out] [and] [see] [other people [,] you know] [. You] [, you] [don't] feel [like] you're alone [, but] [you] feel [like] [your] , [your] , you're [not] quite [as] _, as_ much [of] [a] person [, and] [you] don [, you] [have] [other] responsibilities . 
A|86| B: [Yes .] Ever [, you can't] even , when [I] [was a] kid [, I would] run between my neighbors , three [and] four blocks sometimes [, and [,] as] long [as] my mom had [a] general idea where [I] [was] [and I] [was] back [on] [the] time , 
B|87| M: Uh [, that's] true . 
A|88| B: [and] [now] [I don't] let my kids [out] [of] [the] front yard _, [that_ I] [can't] [see] them . 
B|89| M: Uh [, that's] [a [,] [that ,] that] [is] [a] problem . 
A|90| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| M: [but [,] uh ,] 
A|92| B: [Well ,] good talking [to] [you] [too .] _Bye_ ,
