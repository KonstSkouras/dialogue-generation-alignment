B|63| M: Right . 
A|64| B: because [I] [I think] , [what] [do] [you] [have] there ? _It's_ [a] _house_ , 
B|65| M: [Well [,] I have a ,] I've [got] [a [, a] , uh ,] [two] [year] old ,

B|73| M: Right . 
A|74| B: [Yeah .] 
B|75| M: [It's] [, [it's] a] big problem . 
A|76| B: [That's] from [the] child's standpoint . The child [is] [going] , why don't [you] want [to be] close [to me] [and] [your] other family . 
B|77| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| B: What does [that] _house_ [got] attraction ?

A|80| B: _I know_ _they're_ [really] proud [of] independence . 
B|81| M: [And , uh [,] I think] [they're] [very [,] very] protective . 
A|82| B: [Uh .] 
B|83| M: [And , uh ,] [they're] , [they've] [had] [some] [, uh] ... 
A|84| B: [Well ,] when [she] [got] [home] , who took care [of] [her] ? 
B|85| M: [Well] [it] [was] [my] [mother] . 
A|86| B: [Oh .] 
B|87| M: [And , uh [,] _I] ,_ I'm not sure how , how [it] works now . [I know] [that they] [have , uh] parental control [on] [all] these things . 
A|88| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|89| M: [and , uh ,] _we've_ [, we] , we're not [, we] [live in] [a] real small [little] [house .] 
A|90| B: Um 
B|91| M: [So [,] [it] [,] it] [really] [is] [frightening] . 
A|92| B: [Yeah ,] [my] , husband [and I [,] we] [have] been thinking about his folks are [in] College Station [and] [we've] pretty much planned [that] we'll [be] here [in the] Dallas area [and] there's nothing [to] hold them there [in] College Station since [they're] retired . 
B|93| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|94| B: [So] [we] thought maybe [we] could [get] them [to] move [a] [little] closer here .
