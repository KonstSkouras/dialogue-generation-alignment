B|31| M: No , no . 
A|32| B: [Well , it] will _take_ [you] [a] little [while] but you'll [probably] always [have] [a] soft spot in your heart though [for] [for] Denver . 
B|33| M: _Oh [,_ yeah] . 
A|34| B: [Oh [,] I] [know .] 
B|35| M: [and] _then_ [you] [get] [to see] [the] sights [and] [the] , [the] mountains [and] [, and] [, uh] [it's] [, it's] [just] [, it] really _is_ [fun .]
