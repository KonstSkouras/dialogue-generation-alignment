A|4| B: _Uh-huh ._ You must _be_ _a_ . 
B|5| M: I'm [a] college professor . 
A|6| B: So am [I] . 
B|7| M: I'm also . 
A|8| B: _Yes ,_ what [a] coincidence . 
B|9| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|10| B: _Yeah , I_ _know_ what _family_ [home] evening's all about . 
B|11| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|12| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Right _,_ _and_ then_ _the_ _family_ [home] evening _, too_ . 
B|13| M: _Right _, right_ ._ 
A|14| B: _Right ._ _Well _,_ that's_ good . Um _, how_ many _children_ do _you_ [have] ? 
B|15| M: _I have_ _four_ . 
A|16| B: Two ? 
B|17| M: Uh-uh . 
A|18| B: [I have] _two_ daughters . 
B|19| M: _Oh _,_ well_ [that's] _great_ . 
A|20| B: My oldest is _, uh ,_ [four] [and] _my_ youngest is about [to] turn _three_ . Two girls [. And] _they_ _are_ [a] handful 
B|21| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|22| B: _Yes_ . We've _, _my_ _,_ uh [,_ well] , [when] we first _got_ married _, my_ wife worked _for_ [a] _year_ . Then we decided [to] [have] [kids] . 
B|23| M: _Oh [,_ how] neat . 
A|24| B: _And _, uh_ _,_ she , she got_ pregnant _and then_ we decided _she_ [would] stay [home] _with_ _the_ [kids] . We [would] make _that_ sacrifice . It is [a] financial sacrifice [to] make because we go _from_ _two_ incomes down [to] one . 
B|25| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|26| B: _And _, uh_ ,_ we made _that_ decision _and _,_ uh ,_ _so_ after _she_ [had] _the_ first baby _, she_ stayed [home] [. _And] _,_ and_ we [had] [a] second baby [and] she's still at [home] 
B|27| M: _Uh_ . 
A|28| B: [And] _so_ _, uh , you know ,_ at work [a] lot _of_ people _are_ _, you know _,_ I think_ [well] this is [not] [a] normal situation anymore in our , in our world we live in . Most _of_ _them_ _, uh ,_ continue [to] work if _they_ [have] , [have] [kids] . 
B|29| M: [Yes [,] and] [I _think] _that_ [,_ uh] . 
A|30| B: [I] only [have] one other person [I] _know_ in _my ,_ in _my_ group here [that] works where _the_ wife stays [home [,] and] [that's] because _of_ religious values as [well] . They're Baptists [and] _they_ [, and] _they_ [think] [that's] important . 
B|31| M: _Oh ,_ _really_ . 
A|32| B: _But_ everybody _else_ works [and] _they_ drop their [kids] off at day-care _and , and_ leave _them _and_ _,_ I don't know _,_ I_ _just_ _don't_ _want_ _, I_ _just_ _don't_ _want_ strangers raising _my children_ . 
B|33| M: [Well [,] I] [, I] agree [with] [you] . [I] [, uh] . 
A|34| B: _Right ._ 
B|35| M: _and , you know ,_ they're [not] used [to] _it_ yet . 
A|36| B: That's [how] [it] is at our house [when] you're _on_ _the_ phone . [Oh ,] it's open , anything _goes_ [when] mom's _on_ _the_ phone 
B|37| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| M: [And _,] um_ . 
A|40| B: _Right ._ 
B|41| M: [and then] he [goes] [and , and] watches [them] _. And then_ he gives [them] [to] me [, and] [I] pay him rent [and] feed [them _and] everything_ [else] . 
A|42| B: _Right ._ 
B|43| M: [so] . 
A|44| B: _Right ._ 
B|45| M: [so] . 
A|46| B: With all _the_ yard work [and] things _like_ _that ._ 
B|47| M: [Right _,] yeah [,_ and] he's , he's working [on] his , his Master's . 
A|48| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| M: [But] [, uh , you know ,] he [just] wants [to] get away [from] [the] lawn _and the_ dirt 
A|50| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right ,] we feel [that [,] you know ,] [just] spending _time_ together . You _don't_ necessarily [have _to] be_ doing anything [, you know _,] that_ costs money or , or [, you know _,] that_ requires [you] [to] go [a] [great] distance or anything _like_ _that ._ It's [just] [the] [kids] _like_ [to] , being together as [a] _family_ . 
B|51| M: [Right .] 
A|52| B: Like last Saturday we went , [had] _some_ errands [to] run [and] [so] we took [the] [kids] [and , and] went by [the] Farmers Market down in , in , down there in Garland . 
B|53| M:  !!! Remind me [of] [that .] 
A|54| B: [And] _they_ [had] [a] blast running around [the] Farmers Market looking at all [the] [, you know ,] [the] food [and] tasting all [the] free samples _they_ were giving _out_ [. And] _they_ [had] [a] little pen there [with] animals in _they_ could pet [, you know ,] 
B|55| M: [Oh [,] my] goodness . 
A|56| B: [and] _they_ liked [that [.] And then] [on] [the] way [home] we drove by [the] local high school [and] there happened _to be_ an F A , F A A , Future F A , Future Farmers [of] America , F F A going [on] there , 
B|57| M: [Oh [,] that's] [great] . 
A|58| B: [and] _they_ [had] all kinds [of] pigs [and] horses [and] goats [and] sheep [and everything] [, you know ,] all _out_ in this , in [the] , in this schoolyard there . So we [just] said , hey , let's stop [and] [and the] [kids] _got_ [to] go around [and , you know ,] see pigs [and] animals [and] things _like_ [that ,] 
B|59| M: [Oh _,] yeah_ . 
A|60| B: [and , and] _for_ [them] _that's wonderful_ [, you know] . They _, they_ [thought] [it] was [the] greatest fun [, you know [,] and] [it] didn't cost any money [. _And] [, uh_ , you] _don't_ [have] quite as much money [when ,] [when] [the] wife doesn't work . 
B|61| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|62| B: [Right .] 
B|63| M: [And , uh] . 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!!!!! Remind me [of] [that .] 
A|66| B: [Right .] [Right .] [Oh ,] definitely motherhood is devalued in this society . If you're , stay at [home] [and] you're [a] mother , it's _like_ what [a] waste . People [think] [, you know [,] you] should _be_ fulfilling yourself 
B|67| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|68| B: [and , _and] a_ mother isn't an important important thing as , as having [a] career 
B|69| M: _Right _, right_ ._ 
A|70| B: [and , and] [that] should _be_ first [and , and] _children_ second . [But] _they_ _don't_ [have] kind [of] an , what we call an internal perspective [of] things . 
B|71| M: [Right .] 
A|72| B: [But] [that ,] 
B|73| M:  !!! % !! Remind me 
A|74| B: No . [Right .] 
B|75| M: [I] _want [to_ be] able [to] _spend_ _time with_ [my _,] with_ [my children] , 
A|76| B: [Uh ,] at this point . 
B|77| M: [And] [I] [, I _think] [that_ [,] uh] . 
A|78| B: It's [not] [to] say [that] _some_ day [you] won't go back [to] work . My mother's [a] school teacher [and] [when ,] [when] we started [, uh ,] having [kids _,] she_ [had] [to] work _for_ [a] little while , _but_ [then] _she_ [just] started substituting . 
B|79| M: [Oh] . 
A|80| B: So _she_ [would] [just] substitute once or twice [a] week [, you know ,] [just] _for_ [that] little extra money [when] we were in school . Then we [would] [just] [come home] [and] [just] [be] [, you know ,] go [to] [a] neighbor's house _for_ an hour , [then] she'd [be] [home] . [But] _she_ wouldn't do [that] every day . 
B|81| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|82| B: [But] now [that] [my [,] [my] [,] uh ,] youngest sister's at B Y U now [, and] [so] _they_ [have] no one at [home ,] she's back teaching school full [time] now , again . So if [, you know ,] it's [not] , it's [just] [a] temporary thing . 
B|83| M: [Oh [,] [that's] wonderful] . 
A|84| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| M: _but _,_ um [,_ she , she got] [out] _of it_ [for] [some] reason . 
A|86| B: [Yeah .] 
B|87| M: [and _, and] , and_ [I] agree [with] [that [,] too] _, that [,_ uh] 
A|88| B: _Yeah [,_ yeah [,] you] , it's , it's _hard_ sometimes at work because [, you know ,] people say , oh , we're taking [a] cruise , we're going here , we're going there [, you know] because _they_ [have] [a] lot _more_ money . 
B|89| M: [Right .] 
A|90| B: [And] [a] lot [of] [them] decide [just] [not] [to] [have] [children] . 
B|91| M: [Right .] 
A|92| B: It's , it's amazing _, they_ either [have] one or none . 
B|93| M: [Yeah , I] [, I think] I've seen [some] [that] [are] [more] _, um [,_ I don't know ,] they're [, they] seem [more] [family] oriented . 
A|94| B: [And [,] [and] the] one person [I] [know] [that] _has_ one [, they] [, they] feel guilty . She _has_ this continual guilt trip [that] she's [not] doing [the] [right] thing [, and] [so] [on] [, uh ,] [on] weekends [she] [would] [, you know ,] [spend] all [of] her [time with] her [kids] [and] [spend] lots [of] , lots [and] lots [of] money . Basically [, I think] [they] [, they] [really] spoil [the] child , [to] try [to] overcompensate [for] their guilt feelings . 
B|95| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|96| B: [And [,] and , and] [they] [don't] [want to] [have] anymore [children] because [they] [just] [don't] [think] [, you know [,] that [,] she] doesn't [think] [she] could [be] [a] mother at [home] . That's [not] her bag . So [she] [just] doesn't [think that] [she] could [, you know ,] [the] guilt feelings [, she] can't deal [with] [with] [it] anymore 
B|97| M: [Uh [,] that's] true [, I] mean [, yeah] . 
A|98| B: [so] , 
B|99| M: [Well [,] I] guess [I] [, I] [, uh] 
A|100| B: You [know ,] 
B|101| M: [like] [, uh [,] my] husband [and] [I] , he [has] [a] [three] [year] old [and a] [two] [year] old , 
A|102| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [,] my] wife [, uh ,] likes staying [home] . 
B|103| M: [Uh [,] that's] [, that] [would] [be] [hard] [, yeah] . 
A|104| B: [Uh [,] she] works at [home] [some] , though . 
B|105| M: [Right .] 
A|106| B: The place [she] works [with] , worked [with] before [, um ,] worked [out] an arrangement [with] her where [she] can work at [home ,] part [time] , 
B|107| M: [Uh] . 
A|108| B: [and] [so] [, uh [,] that ,] it's kind [of] [a] seasonal thing . Three times [a] [year] she's [really] busy doing certain things based [on] [that] kind [of] business , 
B|109| M: [Uh] . 
A|110| B: [but] [the] rest [of] [the] [time] she's free . She likes [to] sew [and] do crafts [and] things [like] [that] So [she] enjoys staying at [home ,] [but [,] uh ,] [the] money part [of it] is [not] as rewarding , obviously , [but] there's different rewards [, you know ,] different kinds [of] rewards . 
B|111| M: [Yeah .] 
A|112| B: [Right , right] [, [right .] And] [you] [really] [have to] make [, uh ,] quite [a] bit [of] money . The wife doesn't make [it] worth [it] [, with] [the] cost [of] day-care . 
B|113| M: [Yeah .] 
A|114| B: [I] [know] there's [, you know ,] [when] [you] adjust your income [for] what [you] put [out] [for] day-care [, you know ,] you're only making [like] five .
