A|4| B: Well , for _some_ things . 
B|5| M: Yeah .

B|7| M: Right , right .

B|13| M: Uh-hue .

B|21| M: [Uh] , uh-hue 
A|22| B: Well [, _I] think that_ _would be_ kind [of] drastic punishment . 
B|23| M: Yeah [, I] agree . [I think] so . [I] [, uh] . 
A|24| B: And , 
B|25| M: [I] [, I] agree with [you] . [I think , [I] mean , I'm] , I've seen [some] _people_ get [, uh] . 
A|26| B: But , one thing [, _I] [think that_ if] there [is] [a] chance for rehabilitation then [that] chance should _be_ investigated . 
B|27| M: Uh-huh . 
A|28| B: But , like [I] said [, if] [, if] someone [is] , [is] just pathologically going [to] murder [people] no matter [what] then [I think] [they] should _be_ eliminated from society . 
B|29| M: Right . 
A|30| B: But ,

B|33| M: Right . 
A|34| B: Well [, I] [know] [in] North Carolina , we do [have] capital punishment .
