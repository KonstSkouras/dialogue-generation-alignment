B|5| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|6| B: [Uh-huh .] Yes . 
B|7| M: _and_ [, _you] [,_ you] [get] these _people_ [that] _are_ waiting _on_ _death_ row _, and_ [you know] _they_ , _they_ _are_ _, they're_ _almost_ two _and_ [a] half _years_ old , 
A|8| B: That happens [on] occasion _, it_ _sure_ does , maybe [it] [just] depends [on] _, you know ,_ _how_ closely [the] crime _, you know ,_ has affected [you] personally .

A|10| B: _You _know _,_ I_ don't know ,_ _or_ _a person_ personally . 
B|11| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|12| B: [I think] _I _would_ be_ _, you know _, I_ guess_ _, really_ _if_ [I] had [to] say yes _or_ no _, I guess_ _I would_ say _, you know _,_ that_ [I] am _in_ _certain_ cases _, in_ favor _of the_ [death] penalty _, I don't _know_ _that_ it's a_ big deterrent _really_ _. _I_ don't _know_ that_ _it is . _I_ don't know how_ we'd ever _find_ _out_ _, you know _,_ really_ whether _it is_ _or_ _not ._ 
B|13| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _Oh _,_ yeah_ , oh , absolutely _, yeah_ _, it_ goes [on] _for_ [years] [and] [years] [, and] costs hundreds _of_ thousands _of_ dollars , taxpayer money . 
B|15| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|16| B: [Yeah .] 
B|17| M: _It's_ sad [. I] mean [, _I] , I_ _do_ feel sorry [for] _people_ who _are_ [, _you] [,_ you] _do_ realize [that] [the] average [person] doesn't _go_ [out] [and] [, and] _do_ _something like _that_ ,_ 
A|18| B: Yes . 
B|19| M: [and] , um . 
A|20| B: Yes _it is ._ [It's] [a] tough , tough question . _It really _is_ .

B|21| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: _Oh ,_ absolutely . [that's] _right ._ 
B|23| M: [I] mean _, they're_ , _they_ , _they_ can kill somebody pretty easily _, but_ _they're_ [not] going _to [,_ you] can't [, you] [don't know ,] _they_ [don't] _have_ [the] mental capacity [to] kill [a person] . 
A|24| B: Not [with] me personally . _It_ _is_ [with] [a] lot _of_ other [people] . 
B|25| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|26| B: [It's] [not] , [not] [to] me personally , no . 
B|27| M: [Yeah .] 
A|28| B: No . 
B|29| M: _So_ , 
A|30| B: [Uh-huh .] Yes . That's _a [,_ _it's] a_ tough , tough question _, it_ _really _is_ ._ 
B|31| M: [Yeah] [, [it] is . _I] think [,_ I _think] it's_ important _to have_ [the] support . 
A|32| B: Yes [, I think] _most_ states [do] [have] capital punishment . Yes _. But [,_ I think] [the] U S [is] _one of the_ few countries [that] still _do ._ 
B|33| M: [Oh [,] really] ? 
A|34| B: Yes [, they're] only [, I] _was_ reading [something] _about_ [it] [the] other day [, I think] there _was_ only [like] six _or_ eight countries _in the_ world _, that_ [have] capital punishment still . 
B|35| M: Uh-oh . 
A|36| B: A lot _of_ _them_ had [to have] elected [not] _to do_ _so_ . Now _I don't know ,_ _what they do_ _in_ place _of_ _it ._ _You know ,_ maybe [it's] life _in_ prisonment _or_ _, you know ,_ [something] [, I] _I don't know how_ [they] handle [it] [I] _was_ surprised [to] learn [that] _so_ few countries [have] capital punishment . 
B|37| M: [Yeah .] 
A|38| B: [Oh ,] yes . Yes _, a_ lot _of_ _them_ [do] [get] their sentences commuted [to] [something] _else_ . 
B|39| M: [Yeah .] 
A|40| B: Yes . 
B|41| M: [I] mean _, it's [,_ it] [, it] _may_ [not] _be the best_ [system] _but_ [it's] _the best_ [one] [that] exists . 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] Yes . 
B|43| M: [But [,] uh [,] I don't [know [,] I] think] _that ,_ I'm [not] [a] lawyer [by] any means _, but_ _I think _,_ I would_ [think] [that it's a] _very_ important aspect [of] [a] civil case . 
A|44| B: _Right_ [, the] first _appeal_ [is] automatic , _so_ [that] delays [it] [for] [a] few [years] [just] _right_ off [the] bat . 
B|45| M: [Yeah] , [right .] 
A|46| B: There's , there's [a] lot _of _,_ you know ,_ last minute [, uh ,] _things_ [that] happen cause [a person] [not] [to ,] _have to_ [go] through [the] whole _thing_ . 
B|47| M: Uh-uh . 
A|48| B: Yes , uh-huh . That's [, that's] fairly recent [, I don't know ,] _how_ recent [, but] fairly recent _, _in_ the_ state [of] Texas . Before [that _,] it was_ [, uh ,] [death] [by] electrocution . 
B|49| M:  !!!!,!! [Oh] !! 
A|50| B: Yes [, it] certainly does . 
B|51| M: And [, uh] . 
A|52| B: Yes _, it would_ [almost] _have to_ [be] [, I] suppose . If [you _,] if_ [you] had [to] chose _, I guess_ _I would , I_ am _sure I would_ take [the] lethal injection . 
B|53| M: [Yeah .] 
A|54| B: Yes , absolutely . 
B|55| M: Uh [, I don't [know ,] I] [just] , I'm , I've always felt [that [,] uh [,] uh] [you know [,] [if] [,] if] [they] _would have_ [, uh] ... 
A|56| B: [It's] _a [,_ [it's] a] tough question . _It really [is_ . _I] guess_ [, if] [I] had [to] say yes _or_ no [, I would] say _, you know ,_ yes [. [I] [, I] [would] _have] to_ lean toward capital punishment _, you know ,_ [for] _certain_ crimes . 
B|57| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: No [, I don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|59| M: _Right ._ 
A|60| B: [I think _,] we_ hope [that] [it] will [be] _, you know ,_ _some_ sort [of] deterrent _or_ _, you know ,_ an eye [for] an eye type _thing_ , _or_ [something like _that] ._ 
B|61| M: _Right ._ 
A|62| B: Some _of the_ crimes [are] [just] _so_ brutal [and] _so_ _, you know ,_ useless . This [may] seem [to] [be the best] _way_ [out] [. [I] don't know] . 
B|63| M: [Yeah] [, [I] , I] agree [with] _you ._ 
A|64| B: Easiest _way_ [out] maybe . No [, I don't] _think it's a_ monetary _thing_ . 
B|65| M: [Yeah .] 
A|66| B: Yes , especially [the] murder rate , its [just] gone crazy . Yes . 
B|67| M: [Yeah] [, I] mean [, [I] , I] [know [that] [.] I] mean [I _,] it's ,_ I'm [, I guess] I'm [in] [a [,] in] [a] real strange mood [right] now . I'm trying [to] [think] [of] [what] [else] [we] can talk [about] . 
A|68| B: Absolutely . Yes [, I] wish [I] had [the] answer [for] [that ,] everybody does . 
B|69| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: Yes [, it's] nothing [to] [be] proud _of ,_ certainly _not ._ 
B|71| M: [I , [I] ,] I'm [sure] [it's] [not [.] [I] [think] it's a] shame [that [,] uh , you] [have [to] have] [a] degree [in] [, uh] [in] , selection [of] jury , jury selection [and] [that] [you] [have] [a [,] a] _very_ narrow view [of [,] [of] the] jury selection . 
A|72| B: Yes . Yes , _so_ [have] [we] been [very] , [very] fortunate . 
B|73| M: [Yeah] [, it] [, it was] [a] [very] difficult choice . 
A|74| B: That's [right .] Absolutely . 
B|75| M: Uh [, and] [I don't know how] [you] combat [that [,] uh , [you] [,] I] mean [you [,] you] must [have] [a] [certain] frame [of] thought [on] [it] [, but] [I think] [that [,] [that] [,] you] [have [to] have] [some] frame [of] reason [to] believe [that] somebody [else] [is] worse . 
A|76| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [but] [I think] [that's] [what] [we] all [have to] face . 
A|78| B: Absolutely . 
B|79| M: _So_ [, [I] [, I] think] [that [,] [that] ,] um . 
A|80| B: [Uh-huh .] That's [right .] 
B|81| M: [You know [,] and] [I think] [that's] [one of the] [things] [that's] [so] sad . 
A|82| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| M: [but] [, uh [,] [I think] [,] I don't [know ,] [I] , I] [do] , I'm [not] [sure [I would] , I] mean [, I would] [like] [to] [know that] [my children] [, you know ,] [would be] okay [with] [it [.] But [,] uh] . 
A|84| B: [So] [would] [I , I] fortunately [, I] [have] never been [in] [that] circumstance [, I] hope [I] never am , [like] , [like] everybody [else] . 
B|85| M: Uh [, yeah] . 
A|86| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| M: [and] , um I'm [not] [sure] [what they do] [with] [it [.] I] mean [, you] can [appeal] [and] [they] can [appeal] again . 
A|88| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|89| M: [and] , um . 
A|90| B: [Right .] 
B|91| M: [So] , 
A|92| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|93| M: [and] [it's] [just] [not] [that] [people] [are] choosing [the] jury [or] [that] [people] aren't selected . 
A|94| B: Sure [, [it's ,] [it's] a] big responsibility [, it] _really [is_ .] 
B|95| M: [It really _is] [,_ and] [, uh , you know [,] and] [I] [know ,] I'm [, I] work [in the] legal department [and] [, and] [we] [have to] hire lawyers , 
A|96| B: Yes . [So] [would] [I] . 
B|97| M: [I think [,] uh [, you know [,] I] [think] it's] probably [the] [right] [thing] [to [do] [.] [I] think ,] I'm [not] [sure] , though [, [that] [,] that] [the] jury [system] works [that] [way] . 
A|98| B: Yes . Absolutely . 
B|99| M: [But] [I think] [that [,] you know [,] it] [, it [would] be] [something] [that] [you] [would] look [into] [, you] [would be] able [to do] , you'd [be] able [, you] could [be] able able [to] make friends [with] these [people] , 
A|100| B: [It] [is [,] [it's] a] tough subject [, it] [really [is] .] 
B|101| M: [Yeah .] 
A|102| B: [Right .] That's [right .] 
B|103| M: Uh , we're , we've [, we] [have to] make ourselves [a] pact [with] [the] [people] [that] [we] [find] [the] [most] ways [to] help [them] . 
A|104| B: Well , thank [you [,] it's] nice talking [to] [you .] 
B|105| M: [You] too . 
A|106| B: [Uh-huh .] Bye-bye .
