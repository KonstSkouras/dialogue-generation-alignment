B|17| M: Uh-huh . 
A|18| B: _and _,_ you_ _know [._ Uh _,] and_ _the_ reason _I _was_ ,_ picked _it_ _back_ up _was_ in light [of] _all_ _the_ _, uh_ , [Well] when they found _the_ _, uh_ , _the_ airplanes _on_ _the_ , in _the_ Atlantic , thinking they were Flight Nineteen . _And_ _I don't know if_ [you] are familiar _with_ [that] at _all_ [but] _it's _,_ uh_ , Flight Nineteen _was_ _one_ [of] _the_ _, uh_ , _was_ [a] , [a] collection [of] [a] flight [of] five Navy adventures at _the_ end [of] World War _Two_ .

[And , uh] , because he , he mentions , he , he goes through _and_ brings out points from _the_ Navy's findings _and_ _so_ forth . [And , uh] _, it's_ probably _, you_ _know ,_ real close [to] what _, you_ _know ,_ everyone _is_ thinking , now [that] , they _just_ got turned around _and_ could not find their way _back_ . 
B|23| M: [Well] , that's true . 
A|24| B: [Uh ,] no [, I] [have] not . 
B|25| M: [Well] [, [I] don't know if] you've ever _read that_ [book] .

A|32| B: [Right .] 
B|33| M: [So ,]
