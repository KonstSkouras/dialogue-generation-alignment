B|39| M: [Well ,] yeah , yeah . [That's] _true_ . 
A|40| B: [Well [,] I] [do] [think] _with_ working parents _it_ is [, _I] mean ,_ there are _some_ _real_ issues here [. Um ,] [that] [I think ,] um , 
B|41| M: [I don't] [think] [they have] enough control . 
A|42| B: [I don't] [know .] It's an interesting problem _. I_ happen _to_ , um [, I'm] _a_ pediatrician . 
B|43| M: [Oh] , uh-hau . 
A|44| B: My husband is _a_ physician , so _, uh , _I_ , I_ [I] talk _to_ parents _about_ this _a_ lot . But [children] [, _I] [, I_ think] working mothers or mothers who choose _to work_ outside the home , um , need very early _to_ come _to_ grips _with_ [any] guilt , [that] [they] feel _and_ decide what's best for _them_ _and_ their family . 
B|45| M: Uh . Uh-hum . Uh . 
A|46| B: And [I] feel when [my] [children] were very young [, I] [had] jobs [that] helped [me] be flexible _with_ [my] schedule _and_ spend time _with_ _them_ _and_ all [that] sort [of] thing . And [I] long ago decided [I'm] _a_ better mother because [I] _work_ outside the home . 
B|47| M: Uh-hauhuh , uh-hue . 
A|48| B: [I] _really_ believe _that ._ And _it_ has , um , helped us _to_ afford _some_ things for our [children] [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [I think] are wonderful particularly at this age _, _and_ [I_ think] our kids are _real_ secure . And [have] _a real_ sense [of] priorities _and_ [that] [they] can [do] anything _and_ be anything both male _and_ female _a_ lot 
B|49| M: Uh _, I would_ [, I] agree [with] [that .] 
A|50| B: so [I know] _it_ sounds like _a_ rationalization but [it's] [, I] _really_ [think it's] [true] for our family _, _and_ [I_ think] _it_ has worked very well . 
B|51| M: Yeah . 
A|52| B: There's _no_ question _, I think that's_ _really_ the best . If , if _a_ woman is happy doing [that] , 
B|53| M: Yeah , yeah . 
A|54| B: [I] hate _to put it_ quite [that] _way_ . 
B|55| M: Uh [, [and] [,] and] [that's] _, you_ can't blame [them] [. [I] mean ,] I've seen [some] [really] , [really] marvelous [, uh ,] creative use [of] _it [._ [You] know _,] you_ [could] [put] [a] bedspread [on] [a] wall [and] [it] wouldn't [take] more than [a] few minutes [to do] _it ._ 
A|56| B: _I was_ twenty-nine when [I] [had] [my] first child _and _, uh_ [, I_ would] not _have been_ _real_ fulfilled [. I] [really] [would] not _have been_ totally staying home [with] [a] young child . 
B|57| M: Uh , [that's] [right] . 
A|58| B: It's [a] wonderful , [it's] wonderful [to] be [a] mother but _, uh , I_ like [I] like the _way_ [I] did [it .] 
B|59| M: [Well ,] [that's] great . 
A|60| B: [I] sort [of] worked half time [. I] [had] very flexible hours [. I] nursed all three [of] our [children] until [they] were at least [a] year _and I [,_ you] can [do] [that] despite working very easily which is one [of] the things [I] preach all the time [to] , [to] mothers . 
B|61| M: Yeah . 
A|62| B: [Um [,] _and] [I_ think] [we] choose very , very carefully the , um , alternative situations [that] [we] [had] [them] _in_ . 
B|63| M: Uh-hue . 
A|64| B: Some baby-sitting groups , again [, [I] know] [it] sounds like [a] rationalization , but [I] [really] [do] [think] sometimes [they] very early [on] are around lots [of] other [children] [and] [they] , [they] learn [to] share . They learn not necessarily [to] be the center [of] attention but [that] at the same time [we] [have] [to] be sure [they] are secure . 
B|65| M: Right . 
A|66| B: [I think] [that] helps . 
B|67| M: Yeah [, I think that's] , [that's] [a real] good [way] [to put [it] .] 
A|68| B: [Well ,] so , so . [So] , your wife , does _she_ _work_ [right] now ?
