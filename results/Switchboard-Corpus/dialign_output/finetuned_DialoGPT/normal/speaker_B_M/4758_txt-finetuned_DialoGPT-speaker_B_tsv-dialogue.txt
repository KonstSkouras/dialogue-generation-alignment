B|17| M: _But ,_ 
A|18| B: _I haven't_ bought _it_ now [for about] eight [years .] [But] when [I] used _to_ get _it_ , _it_ _was_ [about] five hundred pages , [about] three hundred [of] them advertising . 
B|19| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: That _, that_ half _the_ fun _is_ finding out what _all the_ products are . 
B|21| M: [Yeah .] 
A|22| B: [But _,] you know ,_ some [of] _the_ get ridiculous . TRAVEL AND LEISURE _, all_ [of] _the_ AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines 
B|23| M: [Oh] _, I_ didn't [know] [that] . 
A|24| B: so TRAVEL AND LEISURE , FOOD AND WINE and [I] think they _have_ some others _, uh ,_ certainly half _the_ pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they _have_ _the_ advertising supplement sections [that] are supposed _to_ look _like_ articles but are paid [for] and they don't care if they make any money on _the_ magazine subscription , they're making everything on ads . 
B|25| M: [Yeah .]

A|30| B: [I ,] I've always had this , _one_ [of] _the_ reasons [I] _like_ _just_ _to_ pick up magazines _in_ other fields _is_ [that] _you_ seem _to_ get [a] very different perspective . 
B|31| M:  !!! % !! translated It's interesting , isn't [it] ? 
A|32| B: So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS [that] _in_ _the_ areas [that] [I] [know] [a lot] [about] [, I] disagree with them . 
B|33| M: [Oh] [, I] see . 
A|34| B: [And I] always wonder whether _there_ are _people_ who [know] [a lot] [about] every area disagreeing with them on everything , or , or what's _going_ on 
B|35| M: _Uh ,_ well _, you know , there's_ [a lot of] things [like] [that [,] you] [just] can't put [all the] [, all] theuries [in] [one] place , you're [not] [going] [to] put [all] these [people] [in] [one] spot [, you] can't _do_ [that] . 
A|36| B: So [I ,] [like] I've picked up now [a] subscription [to] [one] [of] [the] travel agent _, uh ,_ organization magazines and it's [a] ridiculous difference when [you] start reading from their perspective . [Uh [,] you know ,] their major interest _is_ [in] commissions and [, you know , there's] very little talk [about] [the] quality [of] places or airlines . Their major talk _is_ [about] [, you know ,] commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels [to] [people] if [the] commission's [not] [a ,] [the] full ten percent or whatever [it] _is_ and [it] gives [you] [a] different perspective on what [people] [do .] 
B|37| M: Right . 
A|38| B: [Uh ,] some [of] them . The , [the] general travel magazines [do .] 
B|39| M: [Oh] , yeah . 
A|40| B: [But] [I , I] usually [just] [read] through [the] sections on , on domestic stuff . 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] 
A|42| B: [No] . 
B|43| M: Um [, I] guess [my] favorite [is] [the NEW] YORK TIMES . 
A|44| B: [Yeah [.] I] don't take much more [in] myself . 
B|45| M: [Yeah] , well [, I] guess that's [about] [all] then . 
A|46| B: Okay . 
B|47| M: We [, uh ,] [have a] couple [of] friends [that] live down [there] .
