B|3| M: All _right_ . 
A|4| B: I'll let _you_ lead out . 
B|5| M: Well , _it's_ _not_ mine _. I_ _just_ got _it_ from _a_ friend _who_ _was_ _taking_ _it_ _for_ _a_ friend _and_ she _was_ _going to_ take _it_ _to_ _a_ friend's _and_ _I_ said , _well_ _, I_ _can_ _just_ charge _it_ , [you] _know_ . 
A|6| B: _I think_ one of _the_ things _that's_ interesting [to] me _is_ _if_ [you] look particularly at _the_ political changes _is_ _that_ _the_ , they seem _to be_ social , they seem _to be_ economically driven also . 
B|7| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|8| B: So _if_ [you] look at Russia [and] _what's_ happened over there _, I think_ _the_ change _in_ Communism [was] as [a] result of _the economic_ problems _that_ they were experiencing . _And ,_ of course [, I] look at _the economic_ problems _in the_ United States [right] now . One of _the_ things [you] wonder _is_ _what_ _that's_ [going _to] do_ [to] us . 
B|9| M: Well , [that's] true _, _that_ , that_ [is] true _. I_ _, I mean , I_ , _it_ _, I don't know_ , I'm _not_ sure [if] [the] Soviet Union itself _is going to be_ better off under communism _or_ _not_ _, but_ [what's] [going] _on_ [in [the] economic] situation . 
A|10| B: _I think_ [the] other kind of changes like job changes [and] those kinds of things [, I mean _, I] think_ [it's] great [to] even _have_ three [or] four different careers [in] your life . 
B|11| M: Right . 
A|12| B: _I think it_ must _have_ been terribly boring [to] go through , your life doing [just] one thing [for] fifty years [or] forty years . 
B|13| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|14| B: Some of [that] opportunity [for] job change [in the] fact [that , that] aspects changing . 
B|15| M: Right . Right . 
A|16| B: _And_ [the] uncertainty of whether you're [going to] _have a_ job [is] [not] as _good_ [, but] , [the] fact [that] [you] really [can] make major changes [in] your life [and] jobs . 
B|17| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|18| B: _I think_ [it's] great . 
B|19| M: _Yeah_ [, [I think] it] [is] . 
A|20| B: Oh , yeah . 
B|21| M: [And ,] uh , [and] , [and] I'm [not] , I'm _, I don't_ [think] I'm getting [a] [good] _education_ [, I think] [I] would _probably_ [be] better off [in] [a] larger school [, but] [I] don'ely _know_ [what] [to do] _about_ [it] . 
A|22| B: [I think] one of [the] problems _with_ , _with_ [education] as [it] relates [to] this , though , [is] _that [I_ don't _know] that_ [education] [is] prepared [to] help _people_ make those changes . It [just] seems _a lot_ of [the] training [and] [education] [that] goes [on] [is] gearing _people_ towards [a] profession [and] [not] giving them [the] skills [and] whatever those skills _are_ necessary [to] make those job changes , which [I think] [is going to be] _a hard_ thing [for] , [for] _people_ [to] face . 
B|23| M: _Yeah_ [, I think] [, I] don [, I] agree [with] [you] [, I] , I've [, I] [have [a] hard] time getting into [a] , [a] [good] teaching field , because [I think] [a lot] , [a lot] [the] [people] [that I] [know that] _are [in_ the] [education] field _are in_ [that] field [and] , uh [, I] [know] [a lot] _who_ would , _who_ wouldn't , _who_ would benefit most from [a] [good] [education] . 
A|24| B: [Yeah .] 
B|25| M: [and] [I] don tinker [with] [it] [, but] [I think] , [you] [know] . 
A|26| B: There [probably] needs [to be] some training [on] how [to] , [to] , [to] adjust [to] these changes as they come [about] [. [I] mean] [if] [you] look at [the] , [the] high unemployment rate [right] now [and] [you] look at [people] [who] [are in] those situations [, I don't [know] that] they [have] [good] coping skills [or] [a lot] of them , even ideas of how [to] make those changes now . 
B|27| M: Right . 
A|28| B: So [it] seems [to] me [that] while those changes [are] [taking] place , maybe we're [not] [well] preparing [people] [to] make [the] changes [with] them . 
B|29| M: Well , [it's] [hard] [to] say . 
A|30| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| M: [And ,] uh
