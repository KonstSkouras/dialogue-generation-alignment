A|0| B: _Well ,_ we live _, uh_ , pretty close , _to_ _the_ Mesquite Golf Course . 
B|1| M: _Oh ,_ uh-hoh . 
A|2| B: _So ,_ we will play either _out_ there or at Firewheel . That _is_ usually where we play _, but_ _I have_ played _you know_ different courses _in_ _in the_ Dallas area . 
B|3| M: [Well] _that is_ neat . What [is] your favorite _golf_ _course_ ? 
A|4| B: _Uh ,_ both 
B|5| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|6| B: Not at _the_ same time .

B|9| M: _Yeah ,_ that's true .

A|18| B: Right . 
B|19| M: _And_ [, uh] . 
A|20| B: Right . _Well ,_ _the_ reason why we play over there [is] because its where , since we are [a] Garland resident , they gave us [a] special deal where [you] can _get_ [, uh] , ten rounds [of] [golf] for [a] hundred dollars , yeah , [a] hundred dollars cause _it is_ half price _what_ _the_ normal green fees are .

B|27| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|28| B: [Oh ,] okay . 
B|29| M: _And_ [so] [I [have] [,] I] am [in the] process [of] quitting [that] [and] [going] [into] [a] company [that is] hiring more people .

B|37| M: _Yeah [,_ it is] , it's _really_ neat . 
A|38| B: [Uh-huh .] _Well [,_ you] need _to_ [, uh] , teach them how _to_ play [and] take them [out] on [the] [course] with [you] 
B|39| M: [Uh [,] well] , that's true [, I] , I've [, uh] I've always done [that] [, but] I've [just] recently [, uh]

A|54| B: [Well] flower gardens [. I] [like] _to_ [have ,] [matter of] fact this past weekend [I] [just] [got] finished planting [a] bunch [of] tulips [and] daffodil bulbs . [So ,] _those_ ought _to_ be coming up around spring time 
B|55| M: [Oh ,] _really_ ? 
A|56| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: _And _I_ had_ [to get] all [those] off _. And_ [, uh] .

I] didn't [do] anything [to] them [so] they are [, uh] , they are _good_ [to] plant [in the] winter time . They last for [a] long time then . [So ,] if [you] start putting them [, you know [,] you] can put them [out] [in the] spring too [, but] once [it] starts getting real hot then [it] [just] kills them cause they [can't] stand [the] hot weather .

A|64| B: No , they won't make [it] through [the] summer because [it] gets too hot [, but] they make [it] through probably winter [and] spring . [So ,] 
B|65| M: [Oh ,] that's [good] . 
A|66| B: [Yeah [, I] have] [got] [some] [of] [those] too , cause [I] love flowers
