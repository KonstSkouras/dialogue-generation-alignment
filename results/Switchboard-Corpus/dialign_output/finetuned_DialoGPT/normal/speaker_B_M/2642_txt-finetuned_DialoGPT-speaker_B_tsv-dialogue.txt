B|55| M: Uh-uh . [Yeah [,] that] [is] _right_ . 
A|56| B: [But] we're [not] into [that .] We're into [like ,] [have to] [have] [it] all now . 
B|57| M: [That's] _right_ . 
A|58| B: [Well ,] we're geared [to] [that .] We're [like ,] okay , [like] [I] [want] [a] living room set . [And] instead [of] sitting back [and , and] [going] , okay , well [, it's] [going to] cost [maybe] [a] thousand dollars , [two] thousand dollars [and] I'll save [for] [two] years , 
B|59| M: [Yeah .] 
A|60| B: people go , oh , well , I'll [just] go buy [it ,] put [it] on credit [and] they'll pay [it off] . 
B|61| M: [Right .] 
A|62| B: People aren't tuned in [to] [like] saving [for it] [and then] buying [it ,] they [just] put [it] on [a] charge [card ,] put [it] on account [, [and] then] pay [off the] bill because they [want] [it] now . 
B|63| M: [Right .] 
A|64| B: It's always [have to] [have] [it] now . 
B|65| M: [Yeah .] 
A|66| B: no , no [, but] [I] [have] had some times when I've had some [pretty] good balances on there [and [, uh] [,] you [know ,] I] finally [, you know ,] [paid] [them] all [off] [and] thought this [is] [, you know ,] [kind of] nonsense . [So [,] we] [don't] [, uh ,] [have] [big] balances on [them] at , all now we're , we're [, you know , we] [, I] use [it] occasionally [but] [I] pay [it] [right] [off] . We're ... 
B|67| M: [Yeah .] 
A|68| B: [Yeah [,] you] learn [the] [, you know ,] [the] hard way [, you] hate [paying] all [that] interest [and] I've never [been] [one] [to] itemize on [my] income , tax [and] never had enough [to] itemize [and] [so [it's] just] [a] [big] chunk [of money] [and you] realize [that] [you're] [not] buying anything on sale [your] [paying] [, so] [much] [more] [for] [that] item , because you've got finance charge [and] [the] cost [of] having [that] [card] every year which [is] what , forty dollars sometimes [just] [to] [have] [the] [card] . 
B|69| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [That's] [, [a] lot of money] [that] [you] went [to] buy this item . 
B|71| M: [Oh [,] yeah .] 
A|72| B: [And] [then] [you] never feel [like] you've got anything [to] [to] put into savings [or] anything [, you're] always [just] [paying] bills , [paying] bills [, you know [,] you don't] feel [that] [you] [have] any extra [to] save . [And I] hate [, I] hate living paycheck [to] paycheck [.
