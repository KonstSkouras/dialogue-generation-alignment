A|8| B: _I don't know ._ You _know_ _some_ _of_ the health insurance _is_ written _that_ way .

A|16| B: _I don't know ._ 
B|17| M: _Well , [I_ don't] [, [I] ,] I've [, I] grew [up] _in [a_ , a] family [that , uh ,] had _a lot_ [of] Catholic schools _and they_ were very , very liberal [and , uh] . 
A|18| B: You _know ,_ to _get_ into the economics [of] things [, uh ,] because _if they_ wheel somebody into [a] courtroom [and] the jury's heart goes out to [that] person [and they] do one [of] these mega awards _, it really_ _, you know ,_ ultimately _is_ _not_ penalizing the person [that] they're trying _for_ _get_ away . 
B|19| M:  !!! % 
A|20| B: If _it's_ [a] company _, you _know_ that_ they're insured . Unless the award _is_ so staggering [that] _it_ goes all beyond their layers [of] insurance which _is_ another pet peeve [of] mine when [they] do award punitive damages , 
B|21| M: Uh-huh . 
A|22| B: [I] think those should be uninsurable _. I_ think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself [that ,] [that] did the damage . 
B|23| M: Huh [, [I] don't know .] 
A|24| B: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
B|25| M: [and ,] 
A|26| B: For , _for_ honest mistakes where they've done something [and [,] and] something happens . One [of] their employees causes damage _or_ something . Sure . That's _what_ [they] _buy_ insurance _for_ . 
B|27| M: [Yeah] , that's _right_ . 
A|28| B: [Well , I] was just talking about any company _. Uh ,_ let's just say [a] lumber manufacturing company 
B|29| M: [Uh [,] I] [know ,] I've _, I'm not_ sure [if [they] get] [it] [or] [not] [. I] [know that] [some] companies [are] , [are] [, uh ,] um [, you know [,] [you] can] sue [for] anything [you] want . 
A|30| B: [and [, uh] ,] somebody _is_ _on_ the premises 
B|31| M: [Yeah .] 
A|32| B: [and] one [of] the employees actually _is_ driving by with [a] forklift [and] he pushes the wrong button [and] he drops [a] load [of] lumber _on_ somebody [and] [it] injures , them . 
B|33| M: Oh . Oh . Oh , no . 
A|34| B: Sure . Insurance should pay [for] [that] . 
B|35| M: [Well ,] that's true , 
A|36| B: [Well] [I'm not] talking about any loss [. I] was talking about only losses [that] [are] judged [for] [a] punitive damage which _is_ another category [of] , the juries [are] awarding damages these days based _on_ the person's actual injuries [and] _what_ [they] [are] due . And [then they] [are] awarding [a] second amount as punishment to the company which _is_ [a] usually [a lot] less . But _it's_ an , an amount they're , designed to sting them [a] little [for] their , negligence . For gross wanton negligence [in a] claim . 
B|37| M: Right . Right . Uh-huh . Right , yeah . 
A|38| B: And unfortunately the the , lately the courts have been deciding [that] those [could] be paid [for] by insurance too . 
B|39| M: Right . 
A|40| B: So again _, it_ never _really_ penalizes , the company doing the wrong . 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] Uh-uh . [Well ,] [it's] [, it really] [is] . It's [, uh [,] it] [, it] depends [on] [what] you're , [what] [you buy] [. Uh ,] 
A|42| B: They [can] go [right] [on] doing the same old thing [they] always used to . 
B|43| M: [Yeah . Yeah .] 
A|44| B: And [if] , [if they] [know] [some] practice [is] wrong [, you know [,] I'm not] talking about your isolated occurrences [, I'm] talking [more] about the [, you know ,] the thing [that] [they] [know ,] maybe they're willfully manufacturing something [that] [they] [know] [is] hurting [people] out there [and they] continue to do [it] even after [they] become aware [of] [that] . 
B|45| M: [Yeah .]
