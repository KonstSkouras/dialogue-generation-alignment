B|51| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| B: [And [, uh] ,] 
B|53| M: _I like the_ old [, uh] [you know [,] the] old _stuff [,_ _like] [the_ [, the] [,] uh] [the] old Doors [, you know .]

I_ [I] _can_ relate [to it] [, I] suppose [But] [, uh [,] and] [I [like] _,] I'm_ [like] [you] [I like the] older [stuff [,] too] _, because_ [I like] Chicago 
B|57| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: [and] [I like] [I [like] [,] uh [,] uh ,] _let_ [me] _think_ _who_ _, uh , you_ [don't know] Hebert Laws [, but] Hebert Laws [a] flute player [, he's a] jazz flute player [and] [I [like] [,] uh [,] uh ,] Chuck Mangione , [do] [you know] _who_ Chuck Mangione [is] ? 
B|59| M: _No [,_ I don't] .

I_ figure [all] our C Ds _that we_ _have_ what [I] [really] [like] [And [, uh] [, I] like] Breeze [, I like the] group _. I think_ [just] _because they all_ sort [of] [sound] , _they_ [sound] _a lot_ [like] [uh ,] Simply Red _. Uh_ . 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [No ,] [it's] , [it's] _got_ _people_ singing [, but] [it's] [it] [is] instrumental . [But] [it's] , [it's] _got_ _people_ singing [but] [it's] _got_ [a [,] like] [a] whole bunch [of] _people_ singing . 
B|65| M: [Oh [, I] didn't] [like that] _at all ._ 
A|66| B: You [know ,] how many _people_ _are_ [in] Simply Red , Stuart [to] someone _else_ [in] [the] [he] _can't_ [hear] [me _.] [I_ , I don't] remember how many _people_ [, but ,] [it's] , [it's] _got_ men [and] women [and] [it's] _not ,_ [it's] , [it's] nice _, I mean_ [it's] pleasant [, you know ,] [music] . _It's_ _not_ where [it's] , [it] hurts your ears [to] [hear] [it .] [But] [it's] _not_ _as_ , [it's] _not_ [like [,] uh ,] Chicago where [it's] _got_ [that] much instrument [to [it] .] You [know ,] [it] doesn't _have_ [, like] _all the_ brass [and] everything . 
B|67| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| B: [Yeah .]

B|85| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| B: [No] more , huh . 
B|87| M: [Well] _I'm going to school_ _at_ [, uh ,] University [of] [Texas] _at_ Dallas . 
A|88| B: [Well ,] [right] _now_ [I'm] [just] [a] homemaker [, but] [I'm going to school] [, uh ,] for legal assistant [and] [that's] what [I know ,] so [, and , uh ,] [just] nothing basically 
B|89| M: [Yeah .] 
A|90| B: [No ,] no , [it] , no [I don't] _go to_ East [Texas _.] I_ _got_ [a] degree _from_ T W U [, but] [I'm] [really] interested [in] legal [, you know ,] [in] [the] legal environment [, [but] [I] don't] want [to] _be a_ lawyer so [I] _said_ _well [,_ I think] _I'll_ _go_ _back_ [to school] [and] see _about_ being [a] legal assistant . 
B|91| M: [Yeah .] 
A|92| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
B|93| M: _So [,_ I] thought _, [well_ ,] _this is_ [a] little over [my] head [, but , uh] . 
A|94| B: [Yeah .] 
B|95| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|96| B: [Yeah [,] that's] how [it] works . 
B|97| M: _So ,_ we're [going] , we'll [just] [go] _there [,_ and] [then] we'll [go to] [the] one [that] [they've] selected [and] _they'll_ call us [back] . 
A|98| B: [And] [this is] [the] [man] [that] _was_ [in] front [of] [you] ? 
B|99| M: [Yeah .] He's [a] attorney [in] Garland , [Texas .] 
A|100| B: [Oh [,] well] [they'll] , weed him out . 
B|101| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of that] [now] . 
A|102| B: [Yeah .] 
B|103| M: [And] [he] [was just] [as] surprised [as] [everybody] [else] [, [because] they all] had [their] , had [their] little [, uh ,] pets [and [, and] , uh] . 
A|104| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|105| M: "I [said] , ""Okay , [I'll] [let] [you] start . """ 
A|106| B: [Well ,] _not_ necessarily 
B|107| M: [But] [if] [I] did [, I] _would_ [be a] very , very unhappy person . 
A|108| B: [but] _there's_ probably something [else] [that] might make [you] . Because [you] could [know] _about_ [, you] could [know] _about_ [the] crime [, but] _not_ necessarily [be] taken off [the] jury [, you know ,] _not_ [be] accepted for [the] jury . 
B|109| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue [. Uh] [, I think] [there's] [a lot of] [things] [that] [can] [be] done _about [it_ [.] [I] don't [know] , [I] just] [think] [it's] [a] very complex thing . 
A|110| B: [I mean ,] pretty much [a lot of] _people_ [would] [know] [about it] [, you know [,] [and ,] and] [know] some [of the] different [things] [about it] [but [, uh] ,] [they] , [they] might weed [you] out some other _way_ . You [know _,] if_ _you _,_ if_ [you] [don't] believe [, like] [if] [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and , and] [you] [don't] believe [in] [if] [you] [don't] believe [in] death penalty , you're _not_ [going to] [be] picked [at all .] [So] [but ,] 
B|111| M: [Well [,] that's] _, [that ,_ that] [would] [be] true [. [I mean] [,] [you] can't] _say_ [that [,] uh] 
A|112| B: [Yeah ,] so , see , [there ,] [there] [they] [would] _have_ [a] doubt [about] _you [,_ that [,] you know ,] 
B|113| M: Right . 
A|114| B: [because] [if] [that's] what _, if_ [that's] what [the] punishment [is] [in] [that ,] [in] [that] instance , [then] you're always [going to] [say] [, you know ,] _not_ you're , you're _not_ [going to] want [to] _have_ him _have_ [that] [uh [,] that] punishment . [So ,] 
B|115| M: [Well [,] I [, I don't] [know] [, I] think] [that] [that , [that] we] [, uh] [you know [.] I think] [there's] [, I'm] [not] _sure_ [that] [there's] any [way] [that we] [would] [, uh] [be able to] completely eliminate [all] [of the] criminals [from] society [. [I mean] [,] if] [, if] [we] [just] eliminate [all the] criminals [, I mean] we're [not ,] we're [just] [going to] solve [the] problem . 
A|116| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|117| M: [and , [you] [,] [you] have to] , [you've] [got] [to] get [people] [who] [are] [not] swayed by emotion [or] by [, uh , _you] really_ [know [,] uh] facts [or] whatever [to] , [to] [, uh] . 
A|118| B: [Well ,] especially with something where [you have to] [you have to] find [it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt . You [have to] find whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and] [it's] [like ,] [do] [you really] feel [that] [sure] [about] ,
