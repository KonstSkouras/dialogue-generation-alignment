B|3| M: _Oh_ _, it's_ [been] _, it _,_ it_ _has been_ [, uh] . 
A|4| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| M: _and_ we've _had a_ lot _of_ wind . 
A|6| B: _Yeah ._ _Uh ,_ _like_ September _was_ hot [and] dry , October . 
B|7| M: _Oh_ _, I_ didn't _know_ _that_ . 
A|8| B: Really ? Huh . _It_ _really_ [has been] strange here _this_ _year [,_ I] mean , _this_ whole course _this_ whole _year_ [has been] [a] _different_ _year_ in more ways than _one_ . 
B|9| M: Uh-uh _. Yeah _,_ it _,_ it_ seems [like] _it's_ _going to _be_ [,_ uh ,] it'll _be_ [different] [this] _time_ _of_ [year ,] though . 
A|10| B: _But [, uh_ _,] _we_ had_ _, uh , you_ [know] , all these _, we_ _have_ all these [, uh ,] somebody said _, you_ [know] , you're either [a] stranger or [a] fool [to] try [to] predict Texas weather _, but_ . _Well ,_ always , they were saying [it] _was_ [going to be] _the_ hottest summer ever , 
B|11| M: [Uh] . 
A|12| B: [and] _we had_ all [this] rain , [and] _it really_ _is_ _not_ [a] _bad_ summer at all , _really_ cool . _But_ all [of] [a] sudden , in , in [, uh ,] in October [, uh ,] September , October [it] got _real_ hot [and] dry [and] _just_ stayed [that] way for [a] long [time] . And [, uh ,] then _the_ end [of] October [it] started rain almost [a] week without stopping , _just_ pouring down _, you_ [know] . There were flash floods everywhere _, that_ kind [of] deal , [and] then [uh ,] into [of] November _, the_ first , [like] _the_ second week _, uh , you_ [know] _, the_ first week actually _, _we_ had_ _, _we_ [had_ a] _freeze_ , 
B|13| M: [Yeah .] 
A|14| B: [and] _the_ average _, you_ [know] _, the_ average [, uh ,] first frost _is_ [like] _the_ fifteenth [of] November here 
B|15| M: [Yeah .] 
A|16| B: _but_ usually [it's] _not_ until later _It's_ _really_ strange . 
B|17| M: [Uh ,] _I'm not_ [real] _sure what_ day _, what_ day [it] [is] [, but] [, uh] . 
A|18| B: [Yeah .] 
B|19| M: [But , uh] . 
A|20| B: Is [it ,] [is] [it ,] [is] [it] flooding anywhere ? 
B|21| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: _It's_ _just_ kind [of] [, uh ,] we're supposed _to have a_ chance [to] get some rain _the_ next couple [of] days here [, uh ,] which will [be _,] you_ [know] , [a] little bit more typical [, uh ,] autumn weather . [But] _really_ [it's] strange . We haven't _really_ [had] an autumn . _It's_ [like] _we_ went into winter 
B|23| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| B: _you_ [know] _, the_ poor trees , said [what] 
B|25| M: [Well _,] what_ _, what_ _are_ _you _,_ what_ do [you] _think_ [is] causing _it ?_ 
A|26| B: [Yeah [,] uh [,] it's] , [Yeah ,] there _, [you_ _,] you_ [know] , usually there's [, uh [,] I] _have a_ farm [a] hundred miles east [of] here in East Texas , [and] [you] [know] , all these huge trees _just_ [like] _the_ eastern hard wood belt all _the_ way up [to] Maine _, you_ [know] [, it's] [that] same trees , pines [and] , [and] hard woods _, you_ [know] hickories [and] oaks [and] stuff , 
B|27| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: [and] [, uh [,] _I] was_ up there last weekend , [and] there [are] trees _that , that_ still _have_ their leaves on , [and] they're green [, but] they're dead You [know] _, _the ,_ the_ _freeze_ _just_ got them . They , they weren't ready for [it] at all apparently , [and] , [and] _we_ haven't [had a] typical fall at all . Not much color _, you_ [know] , changes _have_ occurred at all . Really weird [this] [year] . [I'm not] [sure what] _that [,_ what] [that] means . 
B|29| M: _Oh_ [, no] , [I'm] [sure what] [it] [is] [, I] [just] remember [, uh] . 
A|30| B: So [you _,] you_ all actually [had] some color , huh ? 
B|31| M: [Well [,] we] [did] [, uh] . 
A|32| B: _It_ kind [of] crept in [and] , 
B|33| M: [It] _, it_ [did] _, [it_ really] [did] . 
A|34| B: [Yeah [,] it's] usually _beautiful_ up there isn't [it ?] 
B|35| M: [It's] [beautiful] . 
A|36| B: Gorgeous . That's _, you_ [know] [, I] [think] [you] could drive along in Maryland [and] look at _the_ sweet gum trees on each side [and] _the ,_ [and] _the_ pines [and] [what] [not] , [and] [you] could _, you_ [know] _, you_ could [be] driving along in East Texas [and] looks [just] _the_ same . [It's] almost _, you_ [know] , identical kind [of] country . 
B|37| M: [Uh ,] 
A|38| B: Beautiful . 
B|39| M: [Yeah ,] that's [, [that] , _that] was_ [one] _of the_ things [I was] thinking about , too , [was] [, uh , you] [have] [to have a] certain amount [of] rainfall . 
A|40| B: [Yeah .] [Oh] [. Yeah [,] [I] was] up [, [I] was] up there cutting some firewood [this] weekend , so . 
B|41| M: [Oh] , [yeah .] 
A|42| B: Little , little oak tree [that was] dead , [and] cut [it] up [and] split [it] . 
B|43| M: [Oh] , that's [not] too [bad] . 
A|44| B: [Well] . 
B|45| M: [Well [,] [that] , [that] was] [the [, _the] ,] uh [,_ the] big [freeze] [we had] . 
A|46| B: [Uh [,] it ,] there's some trees [like] [the] oaks , [like] [the] white oaks seem [to be] pretty hardy . There's , nothing bothers them . Their leaves [are] still green , [and] some [of the] other oaks . There [are] [a] few oaks [that] [have] lost their leaves . Um [, what] [I] notice mostly [is] [the] red maples [, that] [the] leaves [are] [just] dead [, the] dogwoods still look , still look [, you] [know] , they got [, uh ,] bit on [the] ends [of the] leaves [a] little bit [, but] they still look pretty good . 
B|47| M: [Oh] , [yeah .] 
A|48| B: [It] [just] depends on [the ,] on [the , uh ,] on [the] tree .
