B|57| M: _Uh-huh ._

B|61| M: _Uh_ .

A|64| B: _Uh-huh [. Yeah_ .] 
B|65| M: [But [, uh ,] I] _like [to_ [,] uh] [I] [like] [the] outdoors [and I] [like] _having_ [my] house [to] look at , [too .] 
A|66| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| M: _and [, uh _,_ I] didn't_ [want _to] do [it_ . _I] was_ tired [of] [it .] 
A|68| B: [Yeah .] Sometimes [I] wish [I] could _get _one_ of_ these [, uh ,] chemical services [to] _come_ , _out_ [and] spray [for] weeds [, and] fertilize [, and] _all_ [that] [and] _take_ [that] _one_ step _out_ [of] .

A|72| B: [Yeah .] 
B|73| M: _And , uh_ . 
A|74| B: _Right ._ _Right ._ [But] [it's] still _be_ quite [a] bit _cheaper_ [to do it] yourself . 
B|75| M: [Oh , yeah] [, _it's] [a_ lot] [cheaper] . 
A|76| B: _Right_ _and the_ weed _come_ [up] , 
B|77| M: [Yeah [.] _And ,] uh ,_ 
A|78| B: [and] _all_ [of] [a] sudden you've [got [to] do] _something_ else . 
B|79| M: [Yeah .] 
A|80| B: [Yeah .] 
B|81| M: [But [, uh ,] _I] mean _, I_ ,_ _I've_ [had] _, I think [,_ uh] [a couple of] _good_ ideas [in the] paper [, and] _I'm_ [not] [one _of] _them_ ,_ 
A|82| B: [Well [,] [if] [you] ,] _enjoy [it_ too] [, you know [,] you _,] you can_ [get] _out_ [in the] morning when , before [it] gets hot _and , and_ [do it] [and stuff] , when [you] only _have [to_ ,] 
B|83| M: [Uh-huh .]

B|163| M: _Uh_ . 
A|164| B: [Yeah . Yeah .] 
B|165| M: [Yeah ,] [so] [that's] [, you know [,] it's] [not] [something] [that] [I] [would] [really] [have [,] you [,] I] wouldn't [have [,] uh [,] [a] [,] a] need [for] , _for [a_ , you] wouldn't [, uh] [you] wouldn tinker [around] [with] [it] [or] [anything] .

B|195| M: [And , uh] . 
A|196| B: [Yeah [.] [I] , uh ,] [those] [onions] [, I think _,] we [,_ we] planted [like] twice [as much] [this] year because [, you know [,] we] [got ,] [onions [and] they] lasted from [, you know ,] [about] when [you] harvest [them] [about] [a] month from [now] [or] [so ,] [or] six weeks , from [now] , until , until [like] October , 
B|197| M: [Uh-huh .]
