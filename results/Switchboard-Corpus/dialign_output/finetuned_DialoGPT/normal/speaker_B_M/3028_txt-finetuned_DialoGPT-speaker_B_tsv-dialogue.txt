B|3| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|4| B: _Well _,_ a_ little bit _for_ _the_ price , 
B|5| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|6| B: _but _,_ uh _, I_ think that_ _as_ far _as_ quality _of_ _food_ goes _the_ some _of_ _the_ most _expensive_ places _I've_ _been_ had _the_ _the _,_ really_ _the _,_ _the_ worst_ quality _of_ _food ._ 
B|7| M:  !!! % !! ; !! etingrange !! ival !! There _you go_ .

B|9| M: [Um] . 
A|10| B: Some _of_ _the ,_ some _of_ _the_ best _food_ _I have_ _ever_ had _was_ out _of_ _a ,_ outside or inside _of_ _a place_ _that_ [we] drove _up_ _and I_ _was _like_ _,_ I'm not_ eating _in_ _there_ Are [you] nuts ? _And , uh _,_ we_ went _in_ [and] _it was_ _the_ _it was_ _the_ most wonderful _food ._

A|20| B: someone [in the] What's [the] name _of_ _that_ _restaurant_ ? [in the] background Where _at_ ? . someone [in the] background The Hari Krishna .

B|25| M:  !!! eston !! [I've] never [been] _there ._

A|28| B: _Uh [,_ it] starts [with] [a] K . 
B|29| M: _Oh ,_ okay . 
A|30| B: So K A L A [, [I think] ,] C H A N D . 
B|31| M: [Right] . 
A|32| B: That should _get_ [you] close _enough_ _to , _to_ be_ able _to_ find [it [.] I think] [it's _,] uh ,_ _probably_ listed [in the] restaurants [, you [know] .] 
B|33| M: _Yeah [,_ it] _is_ [, it's] [in [the] ,] uh-huh menu . 
A|34| B: _But_ [it's _,] uh _, it's_ just_ fabulous _food ._ 
B|35| M: _Oh [,_ I] love _their_ [food _.] My_ [husband] [really] likes [it .] 
A|36| B: _Well _,_ we_ [like] _Arby's_ . As far _as_ , fast [food] goes . 
B|37| M: _Oh ,_ yes . 
A|38| B: _Oh , really ?_ Why ? 
B|39| M: _Because_ _they're_ , _they're_ terrible . 
A|40| B: [Oh ,] no , no , no . Someone _has_ [been] lying _to_ [you] . _What_ _they_ use [is] _roast_ _beef_ . 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] 
A|42| B: [That's] [what] , [Oh ,] my goodness . 
B|43| M: [And] [they] said , _well_ _, you know [,_ [it's] [,] it] [is] [, it [was] like] [roast] , [but] [it's] [not] [like _,] like [,_ uh ,] [beef] [, you] put [in the] rice [, and] [you] put [, uh] . 
A|44| B: [I'm] surprised [. My] dad worked _for_ _Arby's_ _for_ several years . 
B|45| M: [Arby's] [, I] wonder _why_ . 
A|46| B: [Yeah .] 
B|47| M: [Oh , really ?] 
A|48| B: _Well , that's_ _happened_ before . 
B|49| M: _Yeah [,_ and] [it's] [happened] [a lot] . 
A|50| B: _But_ [we] [like] _good_ [uh _,] _we're_ , we_ [like] _Mexican [food_ .] 
B|51| M: [Yeah .] [Oh _,] that_ _sounds_ [good] . 
A|52| B: [And] stuff [like] _that ._ [And] _so ,_ um , 
B|53| M: [What] , [what] kind [of] [Mexican food] do [you] [like] ? 
A|54| B: A _health food_ ? 
B|55| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|56| B: Like [, like ,] name _one_ 
B|57| M: _Yeah _, I_ don't _know_ [,_ I [, I] think] [I've] seen _them_ [, uh] 
A|58| B: [I'm not sure what] [you're] talking about . 
B|59| M: [Uh _, I] don't _know_ [,_ _I] guess_ [it's just] _like _, you know ,_ the_ [health food] [is] [just] [so] [expensive] [, _you] can't_ afford [it .] 
A|60| B: Huh . 
B|61| M: [And] [it's a] very health- inspiring [restaurant .] 
A|62| B: [I don't] [guess] [I've] _ever_ [been] _to_ anything [like] [that] _so [,_ I] [really] [don't] [have] anything _to_ compare [it] _to_ . 
B|63| M: [Yeah .] 
A|64| B: It _would be_ [good] [I think ,] 
B|65| M: _yeah _,_ I don't know_ _if_ you've [ever] heard [of] _them_ [but ,] 
A|66| B: _uh [, I_ don't know] _how_ [expensive] [they] [are .] It [sounds] [like] [that] [it] _would probably_ , 
B|67| M: _Yeah [, I_ think that] [would be] [a] [really] [good] idea . 
A|68| B: For _one_ _person_ ? 
B|69| M: _Yeah ,_ _yeah_ . 
A|70| B: [Oh] 
B|71| M: [But] [, uh _,] you know [,_ I think] [we're] _going to get_ [, we're] getting ready _to get_ [a [,] a] new [one] . We've got [a ,] we've got [, a] nine month old [, and] [we're , _we] [,_ we] [get] ready [to , _to] get_ her [to] start kindergarten next year . 
A|72| B: A bit 
B|73| M:  !!! Remind me . 
A|74| B: [Yeah [, I] , I] won't [really] [be] interested [in] [going [to] ,] [in] [going] [there .] [Because] [, I] feel [like] _I'm [,_ I'm] _paying_ [, you know ,] five dollars _for_ [the] [food] _probably_ [and] five dollars _for_ something _that I_ [could] [get] along quite [well] without 
B|75| M: [Yeah] 
A|76| B: [Yeah .] Maybe , maybe _that ._ [Yeah .] 
B|77| M: [And , uh] . 
A|78| B: [Yeah [.] I] [could] see _that ,_ then maybe . 
B|79| M: [Well] [it's [,] it's just] [a] matter [of] [how] [you] [look] [at] [it .] _You_ [know ,] _if_ [I] _were_ [, I] [would] say [that I] [would probably] say [that] [the] people who [are] [really] committed [to] [the] cause [, uh ,] [are] _not going to_ pay any taxes [are] [not] [paying] [a] substantial amount [in] taxes . 
A|80| B: [Yeah , I] [like] [the [,] the] seafood [that] _they ,_ _when_ [they] had _it [,_ you know , the] broiled , 
B|81| M: [Uh] . 
A|82| B: [Yeah .] Probably _that's true ._ [But] [I] [know] [a lot] [of] [their] [, [a] lot] [of] [their] specials sometimes [are] fried things [, that] [you can't] [really] [get] away from [the] fried , 
B|83| M: [Yeah] 
A|84| B: Now [why] [would] [you go] [to] [a] seafood [restaurant] [to] eat chicken ? 
B|85| M: [Well] [it's] [good] [, it's just] [good] [for] [you] [, it] [has] [a] [good] [, uh] 
A|86| B: [That's] [one] [of] my husband's pet peeves . He doesn't understand [why] somebody [would] [go] [to] [a] seafood _place_ [and] eat either chicken or steak [, you [know] .] 
B|87| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|88| B: [Oh , really ?] 
B|89| M: [Yeah ,] _they're_ , _they were_ [really] [, uh [,] you] [would] [have] _to be [,_ uh] . 
A|90| B: [Oh ,] _catfish_ [is] wonderful . 
B|91| M: [I have] never eaten [catfish] . 
A|92| B: [Oh , really] . 
B|93| M: [Yeah [,] [and] I] love [that .] 
A|94| B: [Really] . 
B|95| M: _and [,_ uh [,] you know ,] they've , [they ,] [they] check [for] drugs . 
A|96| B: Why ? 
B|97| M: [they] [have] [a place] [at] Resurrection Lutheran Church _that will_ accept [you] [as] an alternate 
A|98| B: [Oh .] Huh . 
B|99| M: [And [, uh _,] [I] mean_ [,] I'm not] [a] great fisher [but] [I'm [,] I [, I] don't] [, _I] guess_ [I'm] [a] [good] [enough] [person] [to , to] [go] [and] catch fish [. I] don'm . 
A|100| B: [That's] too bad , because [I'm] [probably] [not going to] stop eating [it] 
B|101| M: [Yeah .] 
A|102| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|103| M: [And] [I [, I] [,] [and] [I] have] [been] very , very [, uh] ... 
A|104| B: [That's] _true ._ 
B|105| M: [And , uh] . 
A|106| B: [Oh ,] _on_ [one] hand [I] see [that] [and] _on_ [the] other hand [, uh ,] my older sister remembers _when_ [, uh ,] [at] [one] point [they were] taking radioactive wastes [and] storing [them] [in] tin barrels which [I guess] , had [a] half-life [of] , oh , five years [if] [they] sit empty _on_ dry land . 
B|107| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hum . [Uh ,] yes . 
A|108| B: So [they're] putting radioactive waste [in] [it] which reduces [it] dramatically . 
B|109| M: [Oh .] 
A|110| B: [And] then [they] take these things [that will] rust [and] [they] throw [them] [in the] ocean which [is] [going to] speedup [the] process [even] more . 
B|111| M:  !!! % [Well , [that's] true .] 
A|112| B: [Oh .] [And] then [they] wouldn't [think] . They [were] floating around [so] [they] shot holes [in] [them] [to] sink [them] . 
B|113| M: [Yeah .] 
A|114| B: [And] this [is] before [I] [was] born . 
B|115| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|116| B: So [, I mean] [we're] taking thirty years ago , this [happened] , 
B|117| M: [Yeah .] 
A|118| B: [and [,] and] who's [, you know , the] tuna [is] radioactive [to] [a] certain extent . 
B|119| M: [Right] . 
A|120| B: [You] [can't] [get] away from [it] [so] [I think ,] To some point , 
B|121| M: [so ,] 
A|122| B: [yeah [,] you [know] .] So _there's_ [, you know ,] _there's_ some things [I think we] can [we [,] you know] [we] [can't] avoid [for] [health] purposes [and] some things [that] [we] [just] need [to] [like , you know ,] this [is] [not] [in] my control . 
B|123| M: [Yeah ,] [well] [, I don't [know] [.] I] don [, I [, I] think [that] [,] uh , [it's] [,] [it] , it] [just] seems [like] [it's just] [, it] seems [like] [there's] [just] [so] [much] [going] [on] [that] [it's] almost overwhelming [when] [you] [think] [of] [it .] 
A|124| B: So [I'm] either [going [to] be [,] I'm] either [going to] starve [to] death or [I'm] [going to get] over [it] [and] [just] [go] ahead [and] eat [as] healthily [as] [I] possibly can [, you [know] .] 
B|125| M: [Yeah [,] [that's] true .]
