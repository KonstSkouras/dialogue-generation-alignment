B|45| M: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
A|46| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
B|47| M: [and] [they] asked me [if] [I] had [a] certain doctor [, [and] I] said yes [, and] [that] [was] [it] . 
A|48| B: Right . Well , does your _, the_ company [say] , [for] instance , does [the] company [you] worked [for] before [have the] right _or_ [do] [they have the] ability [to say] , hey , we've already [drug tested] her [and] she came up negative .

A|52| B: Right , right . 
B|53| M: [And] [I was] [a] little upset about [that .] 
A|54| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: [And] [I think] [that's] one [of] [the] reasons why [they] were [, they] were having [a] hard [time] [with that] [and [I] think it's] important [that] , [that] [, you know [,] they] had [to do] something about [it] . 
A|56| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] [And] _are_ [they] [tested] random ? 
B|57| M: [Yeah [,] [they] [,] they] [are] . 
A|58| B: They're ... 
B|59| M: [and] they're [all] [tested] positive [for] [drugs .] 
A|60| B: [Oh ,] okay [. [I] see .] 
B|61| M: [So [,] uh ,] yeah [, I] mean [, [I] , I] [would] [, [I] think] [I] [would] [probably] [be] more concerned [with] , [with] safety than [with] , than [with] [the] [, you know [,] the] quality [of] products . 
A|62| B: [Yeah .] 
B|63| M: [You know [,] [I] , [I] think] [I] [could] [work] [in] [a] hospital . 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [And] [I think] [that's probably] why . 
A|66| B: [Oh , I see .] 
B|67| M: [And] [they [,] [they] [,] uh ,] they're very [, uh ...] 
A|68| B: [Uh-huh .] _Okay ,_ so [they] [know] [that .] [And] [that's] ... 
B|69| M: [Yeah [,] [they] [,] they] [really] [do] . 
A|70| B: [Uh-huh .] _Okay_ . Well ... 
B|71| M: [And] [I don't know] [if you] heard about [this] , but [I'm] sure [you] [have] heard [of] [it] . 
A|72| B: [Yeah] 
B|73| M: [I don't [know] .] 
A|74| B: [I think] so . [Yeah ,] seven twenty-five . 
B|75| M: [Okay ,] well [, I] enjoyed talking _to you ._
