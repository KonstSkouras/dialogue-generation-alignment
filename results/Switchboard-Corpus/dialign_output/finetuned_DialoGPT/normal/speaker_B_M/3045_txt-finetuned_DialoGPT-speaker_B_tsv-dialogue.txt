A|100| B: [And so] [I [,] [and] I] wanted [her to] [put it] [into] [the] computer [, and] then print [it] out [and ,] [make] [a] book with [it [, you know] .] 
B|101| M: Uh-oh . 
A|102| B: [And so] [I] decided [well ,] if _she's_ [going [to] do [that] [,] it] [would] [be] [a] whole lot [easier] if she could [type] 
B|103| M: [Yeah .] 
A|104| B: [So] we'll slowly [learn] [just] [to] [type] [here] [and] then then [put] [the] story [in] . 
B|105| M: [Yeah .] 
A|106| B: Yes , yes [. I] agree . 
B|107| M: [I] think [that [,] uh ,] [she's] [a] very good example [for] young , young families [to] [use] [, uh] [for] their , adult children .
