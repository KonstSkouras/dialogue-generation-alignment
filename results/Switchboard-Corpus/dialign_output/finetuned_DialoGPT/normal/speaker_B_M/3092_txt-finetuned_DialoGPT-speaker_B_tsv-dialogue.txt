A|26| B: Also _, for_ working _women_ _uh _, I_ think_ _a lot _of_ the_ _companies_ should start providing _for_ day-care in _the_ , in _the_ , in _the_ building . 
B|27| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|28| B: [Right .]

B|33| M: [Uh [,] I] don't _know [,_ I think] [it's] _really_ [important] [that] _we_ decide what _we_ want [out of] life . 
A|34| B: basically [be] [me] working [to] pay _for them_ [to] [be] [at] _a_ _day care_ , center .

A|36| B: [Exactly .] 
B|37| M: _But ,_ 
A|38| B: Besides which _, it [would_ be] easier _, uh ,_ there's _a lot of_ single mothers [out] there _now_ , from divorces [and] _a lot of_ , _women_ [are] starting [to have] babies without _a_ partner . 
B|39| M: _Uh-huh ._

B|41| M: [Right .] 
A|42| B: [And] [if] _they were_ in _the_ same building _then_ [you] [are] _going to_ _the_ same place , 
B|43| M: _Right ,_ right . 
A|44| B: [and] [you] could _go_ [for] _your_ lunch hour down [and] visit _with your_ _child_ , _or_ _, you know , and_ take _your_ breaks _with your_ children , _or_ something . 
B|45| M: [Yeah _.] That_ [is] _true ._ 
A|46| B: _I think _I_ ,_ _think it [would_ be] fair . 
B|47| M: [Yeah .] 
A|48| B: [I think] [if] [, if] _the_ _company_ could _not_ [provide] [it] [all] _on_ their own _, for_ _the_ _, for_ _the_ people [that would be] using _it [,_ you know _,] a_ certain amount [of] their salary [would] _go_ [to] _it ._ 
B|49| M: [Yeah .] 
A|50| B: [But] _it would_ still _probably be_ _cheaper_ [with] _the_ _company_ helping , our [if] everybody [, you know ,] pulled their own weight in _it ._ 
B|51| M:  !!! % [Yeah .] 
A|52| B: [I _think] it [would_ be] [really] . [really] great . 
B|53| M: [Yeah ,] yeah [, it would] . 
A|54| B: [Yeah .] 
B|55| M: _It would be_ [a lot] [cheaper] . 
A|56| B: _I do ._ 
B|57| M: _Well [,_ I think] _, I mean [,_ _I] _, I would_ like to see_ [, I] _like [to_ have] [the] ability [to] _, to_ look [at] other people's lives [and] _see_ what [they] [have to] say [and] [, you know , and] [, and] _that's_ what [I [,] you] [, you] [just [,] you] [you] [just] [have [to] go] [with your] gut . 
A|58| B: Eye [care] _is good_ . _I do_ _not [,_ I] am _not_ _I do_ _not_ _think we_ [have] [that] _on_ our policy . 
B|59| M: _Oh [,_ I] _see_ . 
A|60| B: [But _,] uh ,_ [we] , 
B|61| M: [I [think] we] need [to] [, uh] . 
A|62| B: [Yeah .] [It would be] great [, I mean _,] uh _,_ the_ _glasses_ _that _,_ the_ exams themselves _are not_ _expensive_ , [it's] [the] _glasses ._ 
B|63| M: _Yes [,_ and] [they] [are [not] _,] they_ _are expensive_ [because] [of the] different types [of] [glasses .] [Uh [,] the] one [that] [is good] [for [,] for] [women] [is] [the] Plano [, uh] [glasses] [company] . 
A|64| B: [Yeah ,] [that's] [true .] 
B|65| M: [But _,] um [,_ you know ,] [that ,] [that] [is] one [of the] things [that [I] think] [is] [really] [important] [, and] [I think] [it's] [really] , [really] hard _on the_ elderly . 
A|66| B: [Right ,] _now_ [like] _my_ ... [Right .] [Well ,] [like] _my_ mother , she has [to go] [for] testing cause she has got , 
B|67| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] [of] [that] [now] . 
A|68| B: [Well ,] she does _not have_ _it _, but_ ,_ she [is] [like] , [on the] verge [of] [it] _or_ , something . 
B|69| M:  !!! % !! translated 
A|70| B: Her eyes [are] changing , 
B|71| M: [Yeah .] 
A|72| B: [and] she has [to] [be] tested periodically [. [And] [,] and] those [are expensive] tests . 
B|73| M: _Yes [,_ [I] , I think [that] [,] uh ,] 
A|74| B: Now [, I think] [your] insurance covers her [on] [that ,] 
B|75| M: [Uh ,] yes [, [I] do .] 
A|76| B: _but_ [you know [,] for] something [like] [that ,] [that's] [just] as bad as [a] _medical_ [, you know ,] [that's] , 
B|77| M: _Oh ,_ yeah , yeah . 
A|78| B: [Right .] 
B|79| M: [And [,] uh ,] 
A|80| B: [Right .] 
B|81| M: So [, uh] . 
A|82| B: Now [, I would like to see] better _dental_ insurance [to] [me .] Was [that] our beep ? 
B|83| M: _Oh [,_ I think] so [, I] was [just] listening [to] [a] program [on the] radio [, and] [they were] talking [about] [, uh] [medical] coverage , 
A|84| B: [Oh] . Huh . 
B|85| M: So [I [have] to] say [I [would] [not] have] chosen _the dental_ plan over [the] health plan . 
A|86| B: Okay . 
B|87| M: [and] [, [uh [,] I] have] [two] kids [and] so [, I] don't [have [a] lot of] [time] [to] watch T V , so . 
A|88| B: [But ,] [with] [the] three children [um ,] orthopedic [care] [, um ,] [not] orthopedic , orthodontic [care] , 
B|89| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|90| B: [because] [on] , [on] [a lot [of] [the] dental] insurance [, they] [do] [not] cover [that] well . For [the] [, the] orthodontia stuff . 
B|91| M: [Uh ,] uh-hauhuh [, uh ,] 
A|92| B: [Yes [,] it] [is] . 
B|93| M: [Uh [,] but [,] uh [,] but] [they] , they're [, they] _have [,_ they] [work] [with] [, uh] [you know ,] other [companies] [that] [do] , [that] [do .] 
A|94| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|95| M: [And] [then] [, uh] . 
A|96| B: [Yeah .] 
B|97| M: [And [,] uh] 
A|98| B: [Right .] My middle _child_ needs [to [have] [,] uh ,] orthodontic , he's [because] his , his pallet [is] squared , [not] rounded . 
B|99| M: Uh-oh . 
A|100| B: [And] [it] affects his speech [a] little bit , [not ,] [not] anything [, you know ,] 
B|101| M: [Right ,] yeah . 
A|102| B: [Right .] 
B|103| M: So , I'm [, I] guess [, I] don't [know] how [I] feel [about] [it , but] [I] don [, [I] , [I think] [I] would] [probably be] _more_ comfortable [with] [a] [, a] person taking [care] [of] [my] [child] . 
A|104| B: [But] [just] enough [that] his bite [is] off [a] little bit [and] [it's] [like] four hundred dollars [, and] [my] insurance [is] only _going to_ cover [like] fifty [of] _it ._ 
B|105| M: _Oh ,_ [really] ? 
A|106| B: [Oh] . 
B|107| M: So I'm [going [to] [have] to] [do] some consulting [work] [on] [it .] I'm [not] sure [if] [I] trust [them] [or] [not [,] but] [I do] [, [I] do] trust [them] . 
A|108| B: Really . 
B|109| M: So [, [uh ,] [I] ,] 
A|110| B: [That] sounds [like] [it would] hurt [more] . 
B|111| M: [I would] [think it would] . 
A|112| B: [Oh ,] gosh . [I , I would] much rather [that ,] [do] [that [,] to] myself than make [my] five year old [go] in [and] [do] [it [.] That] [would] kill [me .]
