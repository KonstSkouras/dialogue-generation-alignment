B|25| M: Right , right . 
A|26| B: See _, I'm_ talking about , like , [in] , [in] _, uh _,_ I'm_ afraid [I think] _that_ _there_ are kids who [just] ought [to be] taken out _of_ their homes [and] reared . [Uh , I] _know_ [the] institutions _don't_ [work] _that_ well [, but] [a] bad day because [I] all these kids through my office . [I] [have] [a] [school] _of_ five hundred [and] thirty-seven kids . 
B|27| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: Five hundred _of_ them are good , solid kids _and I_ [have] [the] same thirty-seven [in] my office every day . 
B|29| M: [Yeah .] 
A|30| B: And [a] lot _of_ their parents are totally irresponsible . Some _of_ them [in] [the] penal [system .] 
B|31| M: [Yeah .] 
A|32| B: And _, you know [,_ you just] see those kids going down [the] road . Now , _not_ all _of_ them will commit offenses _that_ [have _to] do_ with capital _punishment_ [, but] _some_ _of_ them [have] already been [in] youth centers . And _that_ kind _of_ thing , 
B|33| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: [and] if _we_ had something _to do_ before they [get] [to be] full-blown adult criminals [, and] _I'm_ _not_ talking about necessarily [in] [the school system] _, I'm_ _not_ _sure_ _that_ [the school system] _should be_ [the] agent _of_ all [the] social action .

B|41| M: [Yeah .] 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] _I don't_ [, _I] don't know_ _that_ _there_ [is] _an_ easy solution [, but] if [you] could find [a] way [to] prevent _some_ _of_ [it] [, and] _I'm_ _not_ _sure_ _what_ _it would be_ . It _would be_ money better spent than ,
