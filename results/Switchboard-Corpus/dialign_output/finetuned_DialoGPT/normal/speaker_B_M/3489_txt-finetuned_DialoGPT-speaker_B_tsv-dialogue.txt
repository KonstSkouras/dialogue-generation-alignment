A|2| B: My community _, that's_ cute _. I_ live [in] [a] place called _Dye_ Mound . 
B|3| M: Oh , okay . 
A|4| B: Or _Dye_ Community . 
B|5| M: Oh , [Dye] , 
A|6| B: And _it's_ _not_ [a] city _, not_ incorporated _, my_ nearest neighbor's about [a] half [a] mile at least [, I] can't even [see] their house [and] _, uh ,_

B|13| M: Oh , _really_ . 
A|14| B: _I'm_ building our house right now [and] _I'm_ [going to] incorporate into _my_ _, uh ,_ garage [area] [a] weight activated _, uh ,_ crusher . 
B|15| M: Oh , great . 
A|16| B: So when [I] drive _the_ car [in] _the ,_ [in] _the_ driveway [in] _the_ afternoon , _it ,_ _it_ will just drive _it_ up [on] [a] ramp _that_ actually puts me [on] top _of_ _the , the _, uh_ ,_ pressure side _of_ [a] _, uh ,_ hydraulic cylinder . 
B|17| M: Uh-huh . 
A|18| B: And _the_ weight _of_ _the_ car will crush , what's ever [in] _the_ disposer . 
B|19| M: Right . 
A|20| B: hopefully _, it's_ _not_ _my_ wife . 
B|21| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|22| B: [Well [,] I] thought I'd [, you know ,] I'd use _it_ as [a] , an escapement type thing _. _I_ _don't_ know_ if you're familiar with _that_ operation _, but_ , _what_ [you] _do_ _is_ [you] just build up _the_ pressure

B|25| M: Uh , _I've_ heard [of] [it [,] but] [I] haven't done _it ._ 
A|26| B: Very similar _, yeah ._ 
B|27| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|28| B: [Well ,] _what_ , _what_ [it] will be [, you] just [, you] drive up [on] _the_ jack [, but] [you] , [it] won't go down . 
B|29| M: Oh , okay [, yeah] [, that's] [what] [it's] _for_ . 
A|30| B: Until [you] pull _the_ pin _, yeah ._ 
B|31| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|32| B: Anyway _I have_ another _, uh ,_ [recycling] method [I] use . 
B|33| M: Uh-huh . 
A|34| B: You [know] all _that_ _junk mail_ [you] get ? 
B|35| M: [Well [,] not] [junk mail] . Uh [, it's] [, uh]

B|37| M: Uh-huh . 
A|38| B: [Well ,] anytime they send me [a] return envelope [I] put all _that_ stuff back [in] _the_ envelope plus _the_ other stuff _that_ _I , you know ,_ happen [to] gather up . 
B|39| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|40| B: Because _, uh ,_ well , like [I] say , we live [a] way [and] when [you] throw _trash_ away [, you] throw [it] [in] _my_ yard . 
B|41| M: Right . 
A|42| B: And _I don't_ like _that_ 
B|43| M: No . 
A|44| B: so _I don't_ _do that_ . So [I] take [it] [and] [I] send , [and] [I] [mail] [it] back [to] them . 
B|45| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|46| B: [I've] had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
B|47| M: Oh [, my] goodness . 
A|48| B: [Yeah .] [Well [,] I think] _one_ [of] _the , the_ best ways [to] eliminate _, uh ,_ or help _the_ [recycling] problem _is_ [to] eliminate non reusable items . 
B|49| M: [Yeah ,] [I've] [, [I] [,] I'm] [not] real sure [what] [the] steps are [to] [do that] [but] [I think] [we're] [going to] [have] [to] [do] something [. [I] , you know [,] I] don [, I] _really_ [don't know] [what] [the] solution [is] . 
A|50| B: For instance _, uh , I_ saw [a] thing [on] _, uh ,_ NOVA [, I think] [it] was [the] other day . 
B|51| M: Uh-huh . 
A|52| B: This guy has designed recyclable materials _, I mean_ recyclable items . 
B|53| M: Oh [, yeah .] 
A|54| B: Whatever he makes [, it's] all out [of] [the] same thing . 
B|55| M: [Yeah .] 
A|56| B: See , so , plastic [, it's] all out [of] plastic . 
B|57| M: [Yeah .] 
A|58| B: If [it's] metal [, it's] all out [of] metal . It's , he's [a] design , he's [a] engineer , designing stuff . 
B|59| M: Uh-huh . 
A|60| B: And , [and] , incorporating [, you know ,] reusable materials into your _, uh [,_ you know ,] your assembly line into your actual scheme [of] product operations [is] [is] [the] only way [to] [really] [do] [it] [on] [a] , [on] [a] broad scale . 
B|61| M: Uh-huh . 
A|62| B: Make [it] financially _, uh ,_ attractive [to] recycle 
B|63| M: Right . 
A|64| B: [and] somebody will find [a] way [to] make money at [it .] 
B|65| M: [Yeah .] 
A|66| B: And , 
B|67| M: [I [,] I'm] [not] sure [that] [the , the , uh] . 
A|68| B: [Well ,] there [is] [a] guy [in] Dallas [, that's] all he does . 
B|69| M: Uh-huh . 
A|70| B: He collects _trash_ . You [know ,] [and] , 
B|71| M: [Well] [I have] [, uh , [I] have] [one] [, [I] don't] [, I mean [,] I do] [have] two [trash] cans .
