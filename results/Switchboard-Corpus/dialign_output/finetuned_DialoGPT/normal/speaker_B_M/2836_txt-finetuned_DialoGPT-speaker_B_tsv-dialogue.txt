A|2| B: _Uh ,_ where [I] _live_ now _it's , [it's_ not] _so_ _bad_ _.

B|3| M: _Yeah ._

A|8| B: Uh-huh . 
B|9| M: [and] [so] [I] [have to] drive [about] twenty [miles] each way . 
A|10| B: [Um] . 
B|11| M: [and] _we_ [have] [a] couple [of] areas [that] [are] really , really [bad] areas . 
A|12| B: [Um] . 
B|13| M: It's [, [it's] _,] uh ,_ [it] , [it] has [a lot of] different problems _. I mean [,_ you] [have _to] [,_ you know ,] _you're_ [not] sure [, you] _don't_ [know] _who_ _you're going to_ come up against , 
A|14| B: Uh-huh . 
B|15| M: _So_ [, [it's] _,] uh_ . 
A|16| B: Uh-huh . 
B|17| M: _But_ _I _, I_ [,_ you] [have to] wonder [about] [the] _, uh_ ... 
A|18| B: Wow . _That's_ huge . 
B|19| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|20| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|21| M: _So_ _, uh_ [it's] [a] _real_ problem . 
A|22| B: Are there , [are] there any theories _on_ why _this_ [is] happening ? 
B|23| M: _Well ,_ [the] , [the] _one_ theory [I] [have] [is] _that _,_ uh_ [it's not] _, uh_ _the crime_ [is] [not] _going to_ go down as much as [it] used _to _,_ and_ _that , that's_ _one_ theory [, but] _, uh_ . 
A|24| B: Uh-huh . 
B|25| M: [I] _don't_ [know] . 
A|26| B: [But] why ? Why [is] [it] happening ? 
B|27| M: [I] _don't_ [know] . 
A|28| B: Uh-huh . 
B|29| M: _And_ _, uh ,_ [so] [, [it's] ,] [it] , [it] keeps [the] family budget _from _,_ uh_ _uh [,_ you know ,] [it] makes [it] _, uh_ easier _to _,_ uh_ 
A|30| B: Uh-huh . 
B|31| M: _And_ _, uh [,_ you know [,] [it's] ,] [it] [is] [a] _big_ problem [. _I] , I_ _don't_ [know] _what_ [the] solution [is] _. I think_ _we_ [have to] [do] _something_ [. I] don tought [about] [this] at all . 
A|32| B: [So] _they're_ professionals ? 
B|33| M: Yes . 
A|34| B: [Um] . 
B|35| M: _They're_ [not] _, uh_ 
A|36| B: Uh-huh . 
B|37| M: _And_ _, uh_ . 
A|38| B: Uh-huh . 
B|39| M: _and _,_ uh_ 
A|40| B: [Um] . 
B|41| M: _I , I_ _don't_ [know _,] I think _that's_ _a_ little_ far fetched [, but [I] think] [it] _would be a_ great idea . 
A|42| B: [Well ,] [what] _do you_ [think] can [be] done [to] reduce [that] sort [of] [crime] ? 
B|43| M: [Well] _I think , I _think_ the_ [thing] _is ,_ [is] _that ,_ _that _,_ uh [,_ you] _see_ [, _you] [,_ you] say , well _, I_ _don't_ [know] . What [do you] [do] _about _,_ uh ,_ 
A|44| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh _. Right ._ 
B|45| M: _And_ _, uh_ . 
A|46| B: _But [,_ I mean [,] that's] [going to] tend [to [,] I mean] _it seems to me that_ sort [of] approach will tend [to] simply make [the] cost [of] committing [the crime] slightly higher _in_ other words , you've increased [the] probability [of] somebody being caught [a little] bit . The [real] question [is] how [do you] convince [people] [not] [to] commit such _crimes_ _in the_ first _place_ . 
B|47| M: [Right .] 
A|48| B: [Right .] [They're] doing [that] _in_ _our_ state , too . 
B|49| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|50| B: [So] [you] _think that_ [would be a] deterrent ? 
B|51| M: [I] _don't_ [know] . 
A|52| B: Uh-huh . 
B|53| M: _I mean , I_ _don't_ [know] [. _I] , I_ guess [I'm] kind [of] , uh-hating [on] [it .] 
A|54| B: [Well ,] [what] [about] an innocent _person who_ happens _to _have_ been_ found guilty ? 
B|55| M: [Well] then , then [they] [have] [the] _right_ [to] [know] [that they] [have been] , 
A|56| B: [Right .] 
B|57| M: [But _,] uh_ . 
A|58| B: [So] you'd , you'd rather [see] [it] harder [to] convict somebody . 
B|59| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|60| B: Uh-huh . 
B|61| M: _and _,_ uh_ . 
A|62| B: Uh-huh . Huh . 
B|63| M: _And_ _, uh_ . 
A|64| B: [Right .] 
B|65| M: [because] [it's] [a] capital [crime] . 
A|66| B: [Oh ,] wow . [Oh ,] my goodness . 
B|67| M: _and _,_ uh ,_ [it] was [, [it's] ,] [it] really was [a] very violent _and _,_ uh_ [it] was very violent . 
A|68| B: Uh-huh . 
B|69| M: [but] [it] was really [a] tough _time_ _. I think_ _we_ all came up _with_ , _with_ [a] good start [, but] _, uh_ . 
A|70| B: Uh-huh _. Right ._ Wow . 
B|71| M: [But _,] uh_ . 
A|72| B: Did [you ,] _did_ [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
B|73| M: [Uh [,] yeah .] 
A|74| B: Did [you] sue him under [the] civil system ? 
B|75| M: [Uh [,] I] [did] [, I] [just] got [a] letter [from] _them_ , saying _, uh ,_ [that] [they're] [going to] start paying attorneys _, and I_ [just] signed up _for_ [it .] 
A|76| B: [Well [,] you] _could_ probably sue him [for] mental anguish _or_ [something] , _right [,_ and] try _to get_ _money_ [from] him 
B|77| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|78| B: [and ,] 
B|79| M: [Oh [,] that's] good . 
A|80| B: [Yeah .] Makes [you] wish [that] _had_ [, uh ,] still _had_ indentured servitude , [for] [this] sort [of] [thing] . 
B|81| M: [That's] [right] . 
A|82| B: [But] [they] give [the] guy [a] job _in_ prison [and] make him _pay_ _his_ damn debt . 
B|83| M: [That's] [right] . 
A|84| B: [Yeah] [, that's] too [bad] . 
B|85| M: [But ,] um [, I] guess [, you know _,] I , I_ _don't_ [know ,] maybe [it's] [because] , [I'm] [not] [a] great athlete _, I think_ [I'm] average at [this] point [, but] , um . 
A|86| B: Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
B|87| M: [and] they've got [the] [money] [to] [pay] [for] [it] [, but] [, [you] ,] _you're_ [right [,] [it's] ,] [it] costs [so] much [, you] can't afford [it .] 
A|88| B: Uh-huh . Uh-huh . 
B|89| M: _I ,_ [I'm] [not] sure _that [,_ uh] 
A|90| B: [Yeah] [, I [, I] think that's] [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|91| M: [and [,] uh] . 
A|92| B: [That's] awful 
B|93| M: [yeah] , [it] _is [,_ it's] really [, I mean ,] [I'm] [, _I] know_ [it's] [a] _big_ problem [, but] [, uh] . 
A|94| B: Gives [you] sympathy [for] [the] vigilantes . 
B|95| M: [Right .] 
A|96| B: [Yeah .] 
B|97| M: It's [not] [like] he's [going to] go into [a] neighborhood [and] [do] [something] _with_ [his] kids [or] whatever . 
A|98| B: Uh-huh . 
B|99| M: [But [,] uh [,] you know [,] [it's] ,] [it] , [it seems to me _that] [,_ uh] [uh ,] [they're] _trying to_ [do] _a ,_ [a] good [thing] _here_ by [, uh] putting [the] [, uh] [the] , [the] , _a ,_ [the] authorities [in] charge . 
A|100| B: [Oh ,] my God . 
B|101| M: [and] then [the] [person who] broke [the] law gets [the] [money] anyway . 
A|102| B: [Right .] 
B|103| M: _And_ [it's , it's] really _a ,_ [it] , [it] really [is] [a] problem . 
A|104| B: [Right .] 
B|105| M: [But] [I [, I] [,] uh] . 
A|106| B: Uh-huh . 
B|107| M: [and] _we're_ [going to] _protect_ [our] citizens , 
A|108| B: [Right .] 
B|109| M: [but] _if_ [you] catch yourself short [on] cash [and] [you] need [it] , _you're going [to_ [have] to] use [it .] 
A|110| B: Uh-huh . 
B|111| M: _And_ then [, uh _,] we_ [have] [a] dog [, and] she [, uh] she does everything [just] fine . 
A|112| B: [And] [that [, that's] a] deterrent , too . If [you] [think the] home owner might [be] armed , [right [,] and] awake 
B|113| M: [Uh] . 
A|114| B: [here] [you] break _in [,_ and] [you're going _to] get_ shot . 
B|115| M: [Right .] 
A|116| B: Uh-huh . 
B|117| M: [But [,] uh [,] [I think] that] [that's] _one of the_ worst _things_ [that's] happened [to me] . I've [been] [in ,] I've served [on] [a] jury before [, but I] never actually [had] [the] opportunity [to] serve [on] _one_ . 
A|118| B: Uh-huh . 
B|119| M: [but] [, uh] . 
A|120| B: Huh . 
B|121| M: [So] [, it's] [a] [real] problem . 
A|122| B: Wow , 
B|123| M: [So] [, uh [,] that's] [, uh] [that's] [about it] [, you] [see] , [a lot _of] the_ [crimes] [that] [are] committed [, uh] [you know] [in the] [in the] cities [are] [the] same as [, uh] [the] [crimes] [of] passion [and stuff like] [that] . 
A|124| B: Uh-huh . 
B|125| M: [and] [they're] all , 
A|126| B: Uh-huh . 
B|127| M: [And] [, uh ,] [so] [, you] [have to] [be] pretty selective [in] your area [to [get] a] good newspaper . 
A|128| B: [Yeah .] 
B|129| M: [and I think] [they] ought [to get] [on] _with_ _a ,_ _a , uh_ [a] more thorough trial before [they] settle [the] case . 
A|130| B: [Yeah .] Uh-huh [. [I mean [,] I] , I] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [. [I think] [,] uh ,] [what] [I] [would] [like] [to] [see] [is ,] number [one] , completely getting rid [of] these victimless [crimes] . [Uh ,] there's no reason [to] enforce those [and] spend [time] [and] [money] doing [it] [and [,] and] worry [about] these [things] where [people] [are] getting hurt . 
B|131| M: Uh-uh [. Right .] 
A|132| B: _And [I_ think] [one of the] [big] [things] [that] [you] can [do] [is ,] [to] increase deterrence [is [,] uh ,] [if] someone [is] found guilty [of] [a [, uh] ,] felony level offense , [they] lose their citizenship . [And] [they] lose their constitutional rights . You [know ,] 
B|133| M: [Right] , exactly . 
A|134| B: [and] [just] [a lot of] [things] [that] [we're] [trying to] worry [about [,] you know ,] protecting these [people] [from [,] we] [just] [don't] [protect] [them] . 
B|135| M: [Uh [,] _I] know [,_ I] [don't] [think] [I] [could] [live in] [a] [place] [like] [that] . 
A|136| B: [I know [,] [and [I] think] [, I think] that's] ridiculous . 
B|137| M: [And I] [don't] [think the] courts work .
