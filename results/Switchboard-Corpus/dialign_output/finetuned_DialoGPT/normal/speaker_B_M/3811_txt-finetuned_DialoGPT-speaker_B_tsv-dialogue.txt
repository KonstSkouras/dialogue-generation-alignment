A|0| B: _Oh ,_ boy . 
B|1| M: _Yeah ,_ _so_ he's _a_ little bit young _for a_ kindergartner . 
A|2| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|3| M: _We_ _have a_ seven _year_ old _and_ _a_ _three_ _year_ old . 
A|4| B: Are _you_ ? Where are [a] student ? 
B|5| M: _Uh ,_ University _of_ Rochester . 
A|6| B: No kidding . 
B|7| M: _Yeah ,_ _so_ _that's _a_ real_ _change_ . 
A|8| B: _I_ was [a] professor in [a] university here in California [for a] while . 
B|9| M: [Oh ,] _really_ ? 
A|10| B: [Yeah _,] uh ,_ are _you_ _going_ _to_ _, uh ,_ put your son in child care in [a] , [a] [year] or two ? 
B|11| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|12| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| M: _and_ _so_ _that's_ [going] away . 
A|14| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|15| M: _So_ [, uh] . 
A|16| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|17| M: _And_ [, uh ,] _so_ _, we_ _, we_ _have_ [, uh] 
A|18| B: _Yeah ._ _Yeah ._ 
B|19| M: _And_ [, uh] . 
A|20| B: Well , [that's a] good experience _, I_ think , _and [, uh_ ,] _there_ are [a] lot [of] things _to_ think about [and] the articles _that_ are written on the topic , are pretty good [and] they kind [of] boil down _to_ [, uh ,] any other important decision _you_ [really] [have] _to_ explore the alternative 
B|21| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: [and] what [we] found [, uh ,] _to_ be the best guide was our own instincts about , people who were [going] _to_ be loving 
B|23| M: _Uh_ . 
A|24| B: _and [, uh_ ,] [that's] more important than anything else . [We] could [have] sent [, uh ,] her _to_ [a] fancier [, uh ,] facility . 
B|25| M: Right . 
A|26| B: [Uh ,] she goes _to_ [a] _home_ . This is [a] [, uh ,] [a] couple [, uh ,] emigrated from China early in , in their lives . 
B|27| M: Huh . 
A|28| B: They've been here probably thirty , forty _years_ . 
B|29| M: Thirty [years] ? 
A|30| B: They've got [three] daughters . [Uh ,] _and ,_ they [have a] loving _home_ _and [, uh_ ,] they're both _there_ [and] they [have a] kid _that_ comes in [and] helps _them_ in the afternoon . 
B|31| M: [Oh] . 
A|32| B: [And] our daughter is healthy , happy , well adjusted [and] enjoys [going] _to_ _see_ her friends , 
B|33| M: [Uh] . 
A|34| B: [so] it's [a] good experience . 
B|35| M: [Yeah ,] I've never had [to] leave _my_ _kids_ _at_ [home] without [them] , 
A|36| B: _I_ if it's good _, I_ think it's very good [for] the child . 
B|37| M: [Yeah [,] I] [, I] agree with [you] [there] . 
A|38| B: [And] if it's , [a] loving environment [, I] think it's very good _and ,_ [and] [that's] [really] what we've learned about it . She'll [have] [to] go on [to] something more stimulating in terms [of] preschool in [a] [year] 
B|39| M: [Yeah .] 
A|40| B: but [, uh [,] we] feel [real] fortunate [and] [we] were able [to] [, uh ,] just [, uh ,] choose in the marketplace . [I] don't know what it's like around [, uh ,] Hattiesburg . 
B|41| M:  !!! ; !! Remind _me_ [of] _that ._ 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah .] 
B|43| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|44| B: [Yeah .] I'll bet they're involved . [Yeah .] 
B|45| M: [and , uh] . 
A|46| B: [Yeah] 
B|47| M: _So_ [, uh] . 
A|48| B: Well , [that's] [, uh [,] I] know it's , it's [a real] hard thing [to] do , even [for] people in , in [, uh ,] university communities . 
B|49| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| B: Out here [at] Manford , they [have a] , [you] know , [a] , [a] , [a real] good facility [and] [there] [, uh ,] is quite [a] waiting list [to] get into [that .] 
B|51| M: [Oh [,] I] [see] . 
A|52| B: [So] it's [, uh [,] uh ,] [you] know , it's [a] , it's [a] , it's an important , decision , it's an industry [that's] still [a] cottage industry 
B|53| M: [Uh] . 
A|54| B: [and] [I] think this is [really] is buyer beware . Well , it is the best way [to] do it , interestingly . 
B|55| M: That's right . 
A|56| B: [I] think [that] [, uh ,] [my] own interest in , in development , human development leads [me] [to] believe [that] [that's a] good sign [and] [that] [, uh ,] private enterprise is the way [to] go [and] [that] it will lead [to] [a] fundamental [change] in the way [we] learn . 
B|57| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: Because [, I] think what we're [going] [to] go [to] is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . As [a] matter [of] fact , [my] future is banked on [that] [, uh ,] professionally because [I] believe [that] , [that] [there] are [, uh ,] pressing needs in the marketplace , unmet by schools , colleges universities [for] [, uh ,] learning [a] lot [of] things [that] [kids] can learn watching Sesame Street [and] in child care . 
B|59| M: Right . Right . Right , right . 
A|60| B: Primary skills which turn out [to] be the most important skills in life . 
B|61| M: Right . Right . 
A|62| B: It's , it's phenomenal . It's phenomenal , the programming , the human operating system ,
