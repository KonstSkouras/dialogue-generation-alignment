A|63| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|64| M: [So] _that's_ interesting _, but_ [, uh] . 
A|65| B: Well [, it's] [, uh ,] [we] [have] [, [uh [,] uh] ,] kind [of] [a] core group [that _,] that_ serves [as] , quote , officers [of the] organization , 
B|66| M: [Uh] . 
A|67| B: [and] [they] plan [the] reunions [, the] organize [the] [, you know ,] [who] is _going_ [to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] coffee pot gets [there] , who's _going_ [to] rent [the] tables , who's _going_ [to] see [to] [it] [that] [the] silverware gets turned back [to] [the] caterer . [Uh] [, and] each year [it's] [done] [a] little bit differently , because different people serve in those roles . 
B|68| M: [Right ,] right . 
A|69| B: We [have a] biographer [who] , [who] continues every year [to] save clippings _on_ [any] [family] member [, and] they're entered into _a ,_ [a] wonderful [, uh ,] scrap [book .] [And] pictures [of] new babies [and] new people [who] [have] [been] added [and] [, and] obituaries [to] those [who are] gone . [And] [it] keeps [the family] alive , even [, you know ,] even though [it's] [very] fluid . 
B|70| M: Huh . 
A|71| B: [And] they're [very] dedicated [to] [that [,] and] [, uh [,] it's] [been] [really] wonderful . It helps [you] hang onto your roots . 
B|72| M: Oh [, yeah] . 
A|73| B: [And] [it] helps [you] feel [a] strong sense [of] belonging . My husband , _on_ [the] [other] hand , [was] [not] [very] close [to] his [family .] His [family] [was] [very] scattered [and] [very] diverse . 
B|74| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|75| B: "And [I] asked him [, I] got [to] talking [to] him [, I] said , well [, how] is his nephew doing . ""Well _, I don't [know_ , I] [haven't] , [talked] [to] [my] brother in three years . "" [I] said , ""Well , how's your brother doing ? "" ""I _don't [know_ .] "" [Uh] [, you know ,] [my] son keeps in touch [with] him [, I think] [, but] [I don't] . " 
B|76| M:  !!! % !! Remind _me_ . 
A|77| B: "I said , ""Hey , wouldn't [you] like [to] [know] what's happening [with] these people ? "" ""Yeah [, but] [I'm] [, you know [,] it's] _too_ [much] trouble . "" [So] [I] got busy , got together [, and] put [a] reunion together [for] his [family .] [And] succeeded in getting all [of] his brothers [and] sisters [and] all [of] their offspring [but] _one_ [to] our place down at Lake Tawakoni . " 
B|78| M:  !!! % !! Remind _me_ . That's [a ,] _that's_ [a] [really] nice area . 
A|79| B: Liked [to] kill [me] , because [I] _it was [,_ I] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation [, I] [did _,] it_ by myself . 
B|80| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! Remind [me] . 
A|81| B: [And , uh ,] nobody brought covered dishes . We _had_ [a great big] fish fry [, and] [, you know , I] fixed [a] salad in [a] number three tub . 
B|82| M: Oh [, that] sounds [great] . 
A|83| B: [And [,] and] _, uh , it was_ an enormous task [to] bring all [of] those people together [with] [just] _one_ or two people helping . [And , uh ,] _we had_ [to] provide sleeping arrangements [for] all [of] them [and] [I] told him , 
B|84| M: Oh , [I'm] sorry [, I] missed [that] . Yeah [, I don't know] _what_ [they] were , 
A|85| B: "We [did] [it] [that] year [, and then] [the] following summer , [we did] [not] [have] all [of [the] family] [there] . We sent invitations . We said , ""Please let us [know] if you're coming . "" It [was] when [, uh ,] his mother , his step father _had_ died [the] year before , " 
B|86| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|87| B: [and] [it ,] his mother [was] alone [, [and] so] [they] came [to] support her [, and then] _one_ by _one ,_ his [you know ,] his sisters , he began [to] lose [family] members , 
B|88| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|89| B: [and] [it was] difficult [to] hold them together . [And] [then] , [of] course , he died two years ago [, [so] [,] you know [,] that] [family] has gone down [to] _one_ brother [and] _one_ sister now . 
B|90| M: Yeah . 
A|91| B: [And _, uh ,] [it_ [,] I think] [that's] [what] happens when [they] [get] scattered [, the] [, the family] unit [, you know ,] falls , into disrepair . 
B|92| M: [Right .] 
A|93| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|94| M: [But , uh] . 
A|95| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|96| M: [but] [it was [,] it was] something [that] [we had] planned [on] [going] [on] . 
A|97| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|98| M: [but] [the second] [one] [was [,] uh , it was] [a good] [one ,] [too] . 
A|99| B: [Uh-huh .] Well , see , [we] manage , those people [who are] at [that] core group manage [to] keep , keep [the] vigor alive . They'll send [out] news bulletins . Two or three times [a] year you'll [get] [a] news hey , guess [who] got [, you know ,] elected [to] [the] legislature , or guess [who] our local sheriff ,
