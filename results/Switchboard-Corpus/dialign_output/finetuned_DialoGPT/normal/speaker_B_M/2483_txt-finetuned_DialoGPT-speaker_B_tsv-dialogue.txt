B|14| M: _Oh ,_ okay . 
A|15| B: [and] [it] comes [on] _with_ _C_ N N in [the] morning .

A|17| B: That we , we wake up to [television] [news] [and] [, uh] [, uh] , shower [and] dress _, and_ whatever to [that _,] and_ then _because_ [of the] fact [that] my wife _and I_ ride to work together [, uh] , in [a] car , we , we chat at each other rather than , than something else . 
B|18| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|19| B: [Uh _,] and_ occasionally what we'll each [do] depending [on] whoever _is_ driving _is_ [have] [the] newspaper _sort of_ [on] our lap [on] [the] way in , in [the] car , [so] we [have] [the] advantage [of] being able to [, uh] , read [and] drive although there seems to be , [from] what _I've_ seen [on] [the] freeway recently [that] [a] fair number [of] people are reading [and] driving 
B|20| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|21| B: _So ,_ we , we [rely] pretty , pretty heavily _, _I think_ ,_ [on] [a] combination [of [the] ,] [of the] two [. I] also [, uh] , use [, uh] , NEWSWEEK magazine . [Uh ,] 
B|22| M: _Uh-huh ._

B|24| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|25| B: [and] [, uh] _, I_ read sporadically [of] commentary [and] [a] couple [of] other _, you know ,_ trade magazines _, and_ [, uh] [, uh] , such [as] [that , uh] , where [I] might read _the , the_ occasional social [and] even current event commentaries _, and_ _, and_ everything [as] diverse [as] A _C_ M to [, uh] [, uh] , some [of [the] , uh] , some [of the] other tabloids [I] [get] . _So , uh_ _, I_ guess [I] use [about] eighty percent written , _is_ probably my input [and] twenty percent [, uh] , [television . _I] , I think_ [I] respect [the ,] [from] [a] journalistic perspective current events . 
B|26| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|27| B: _I've_ always said [that] [it] [, it's] _really_ [not] interesting unless [it's] three weeks old [and] found its way into [a] [news] weekly headline . 
B|28| M: _Yeah_ .

B|30| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|31| B: [Uh ,] we're probably [not] thrilled _with_ our only newspaper [that] we [have] in Raleigh .

B|32| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|33| B: [Uh [,] it] depends . It [, _it's] ,_ has decent national coverage , [but] has an extremely focused political coverage , probably steeped in _, the_ southern history [and] [the] fact [that] this _is_ [a] Democratic State . 
B|34| M:  !!!!,!!!.!! iful !! 
A|35| B: _And , uh_ , consequently everything _is_ filtered through [that , uh] , Republican Democratic _sort of_ , glass , almost unnecessarily 
B|36| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|37| B: [so] . 
B|38| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|39| B: [Yeah] , we , we [have _,] that is_ [, uh] , [as] [a] matter [of] fact [they] update [it] once [a] week _with_ [a] special section , we _, and_ we pay [it] _sort of_ glancing nod . We [, uh] , [have] [a] _very_ good friend who _is_ [, uh] , tapped into [the] city planning structure . [Uh ,] our developer architect friend [and] , 
B|40| M: _Oh ,_ [really] . 
A|41| B: Right . _So _,_ I think_ we find out what's happening in [the] city [, uh] , [on] [a] fairly frequent basis , over [a] , over [a] gin [and] tonic _sort of_ _thing_ . 
B|42| M: _Uh-huh ._ Uh-hue . 
A|43| B: [Uh _,] and_ [that] probably gives _us_ [a] [better] insight [as] to [the] city [of] Raleigh than , than [the] paper [would] [have] anyway . 
B|44| M: Well [, I] [don't] [know] [. [I] think [,] uh] .

B|48| M: [I , I] [don't] _watch C_ NN [very] much any _more_ . 
A|49| B: Is [that] right ? I'll heard there was some stuff [on] [the ,] [on] [the] [radio] [that] was equivalent to [C] N N . 
B|50| M: [Yeah] . 
A|51| B: Okay . 
B|52| M: [it's [,] it's] kind [of] like [C] NN [, you know ,] [sort _of] a_ little bit _different_ . 
A|53| B: Okay . 
B|54| M: [And] [I [,] [and] [I] , I think] [it's] [because] [the , uh] [the , the [,] I] [don't] [know ,] [I've] [, I'm not] [really] [sure] [, uh] . 
A|55| B: [Oh ,] That didn't [, uh] , 
B|56| M: [So , uh] . 
A|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|58| M: But [, uh] . 
A|59| B: [Uh ,] we probably were listening to [C] N N fairly heavily before [the] war broadcasts began . [Uh ,] we almost live [and] [, and] breathed [it] for , [because] during [the] war itself to [the] point where we began to [sort of] [have] household pact [of] lets turn [the] war off [and] [get] something done . 
B|60| M: [Yeah] . 
A|61| B: [Uh ,] almost an addition [, uh] [, and] [, and] [, and] we could equate or relate relay well to some [of the] newspaper [and] [television] articles [about] [the] fact [that] people where having this problem in , in unhooking , uncoupling [from the] events [, and] going [on] _with_ their . [So ,] 
B|62| M: Well _, that's_ true [, [that] [,] that is] true . Uh-hue . 
A|63| B: instead [of] being , watching [the] missiles [and] being glued to [the] tube or whatever . [Uh [,] and] [because] [of] [that] we began towards [the] middle [and] [of the] war [, I] guess [about] two [and] [a] half or three weeks in , we began to restrict our [news] almost deliberately where we [would] [, uh] , [watch] [, uh] , fifteen minutes before , fifteen minutes after six our time which [would] be national [news] , or our local [news] . We [would] [watch C] N N until six thirty , then we [would] [watch] [, uh] , [a] rotating network [news] [of] either [, uh] , A B [C] , [C] B S , or N B [C] [and] we , we [sort of] just rotated around [the] dial each night [a] [different] [one] . 
B|64| M: [Oh ,] yeah [, I think] _that's , that's_ _the same_ [thing] [with] [us .] We've [, uh] 
A|65| B: [and] then we [would] turn [the television] off [and] we were [sort of] limiting or dieting ourselves [on] , [on] [news] [that] way . [And ,] then we [would] [do a] similar [thing] [, uh] , at [uh] , ten forty-five [because] [, uh] , [C] N N [would] be wrapping their hourly coverage up [and] then we [would get] [the] local coverage [, uh] [, and] then [I think] [the] local coverage we [would] tend to [watch] [the same] station [that] [would] , [would] [have] [better] state coverage rather than local coverage . [Uh ,] three [of the] networks here , [on] their local [news] [, uh] [, that] if , if [you] wish to listen at eleven o'clock [you] can find out who raped who , murdered who , or stole what . [from] whom . 
B|66| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|67| B: [And [,] that] was [the] [sort of] [thing] [that] [I would] say [is] [the] best MUMBLEx [and not] [news] 
B|68| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|69| B: unless there's some trend or something [that] says , Jesus this neighborhood has been hit forty-seven times or whatever . [Uh [,] [that's] , that's] [sort of] [more] [of] , [of a] pattern [news] .
