B|1| M: _Uh_ . 
A|2| B: _right_ , _we_ wound up _just_ choosing _a ,_ another Mennonite _nursing_ _home_ _that was_ easier _to_ get into . Or _but_ naturally , no , _it_ _was_ even Mennonite related , I'm sorry , _it_ _was_ actually not _a_ particularly great _nursing_ _home_ . Mostly _the_ thing _was_ _that_ _it_ _was_ available when _we_ needed _it _,_ because_ he suddenly got sick _and_ needed _to be_ put _in_ . 
B|3| M: _Uh-huh ._ Oh _, _that's_ ,_ [that] sounds awful 
A|4| B: [Uh] , what _do_ _you_ _think_ ? 
B|5| M: Well , _I_ , _I_ don't [think] [that] [, uh] [nursing] homes are safe . 
A|6| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|7| M: [and] [we] made [a] point _of_ doing [that] . She [had] been [in] [a ,] _a nursing_ homes before _, but_ she has now , um . 
A|8| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|9| M: _so_ she [had] [to] _make_ [that] decision on her _own_

A|12| B: _yeah_ [, that's] _important_ _I would_ say . 
B|13| M: [Yeah .] [Yeah] , [I] , [I would] , [I] really [think] _so_ [, because] it's [important] for your [, uh ,] your family [and] for your future _, too_ . 
A|14| B: Okay . 
B|15| M: [and] [, uh ,] she [is] able [to] _, to_ [do] [that] _, and_ it's [very] convenient [because] , [you] know , she has [a] private baby-sitter [that] , [you] can [just] trust her _with_ whatever she decides , [you] , she will [do] [it ,] 
A|16| B: [Yeah .] 
B|17| M: [and] she [was] [very] , [very] concerned about me , 
A|18| B: Right [, and] [that] becomes difficult then . 
B|19| M: It really [is] . 
A|20| B: [Uh-huh .] Yep , [we] tried [to] convince _my_ grandfather [to] live [with] us at several points _during the_ last few years [of] his life [, but] he [was] essentially [too] proud [and] [too] independent [so] [that] even though his heart [was] getting incredibly weak [and] his knees were going bad he lived [in] his [own] house as long as he _could_ 
B|21| M: [Uh] . 
A|22| B: [but] he [was] _living_ alone , [had] _an_ upstairs _apartment_ , _could_ barely [make] [it] up _the_ steps [to] _the_ top without [a] great deal [of] pain , 
B|23| M: [Uh] . 
A|24| B: [and] this , eventually things [just] [went] [too] far 
B|25| M: [Yeah] [, _that's] ,_ [that was] [my] mother [living] [with] me [, and] [I] [was] [just] , [you] know , [I] [was] [in] [a ,] [a] situation where [my] mother [was] [in] [an] [apartment] [and] [, uh ,] [you] [could] [see] her crying , 
A|26| B: [and] he allowed himself _to be_ put into [a nursing] _home_ . 
B|27| M: [Yeah] [, _that's] ,_ [that] [would] [be] [a] nightmare . 
A|28| B: Right 
B|29| M: [and] she's , she's gone through [a] period [of] depression [, and] she's [had] [to] find [a] good [home] [and] [, and] [, uh ,] take care [of] herself [and] everything . 
A|30| B: well [that's _,] yeah_ [, that's] _right_ [that] _the_ children _have_ some responsibility [, too] [, to] their parents [and] such [, to] help decide what's _the_ _right_ thing . 
B|31| M: [Yeah] [, yeah] . 
A|32| B: And . 
B|33| M: [and] [, uh ,] she [was] really good [, but] [I] , [I] , [you] know , [I] [just] , [I] don't [think] [that] , [that] [, uh] [that] [we] [have] [to] , [you] , [you] [have] [to be] [so] totally convinced [that] , you're , [you] can't [do] everything on her every day . 
A|34| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| M: [and] she doesn't [have] [to be] there [during the] day , she can [just] go [right] down [the] hallway [and] sit [, and] [and] [, and] , [you] know ,
