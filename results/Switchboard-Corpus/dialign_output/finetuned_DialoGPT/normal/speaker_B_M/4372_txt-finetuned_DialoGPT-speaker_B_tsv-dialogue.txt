And _I think_ _that_ _it's_ _not_ my responsibility _to_ police myself _and_ _pay_ Pennsylvania what _they_ _believe they_ are owed even though _, you_ _know ,_ _the_ revenue stream went _to_ another state . _I_ _don't_ _, I_ _don't_ _think_ _that_ that's my responsibility as _a_ , as _a_ conscientious consumer . 
B|2| M: _Well_ [I think] _, I think_ [they] should have [the] ability [to] , [to] _check_ _things_ like [that] [and] [I think] [it's] just [the] fact [that] [they] , [they] [, I] [believe they] _, uh_ [they] _check [for_ _that] _,_ but_ [they] [don't] actually _check for_ , [for] [, you] [, I] [know _,] uh_ . 
A|3| B: _Well [,_ I think] [that] if , if policy is established [and] if _a_ mechanism is put into place [to] promote [the] collection _of_ taxes _in_ this fashion , then [I] [don't] argue with _it_ . Because [it's] _not_ _a_ burden _on the_ consumer [to] remember [that] oh [, I] bought this out _of_ state . [I] need [to] Xerox [the] receipt [and] make out _a_ [check for] six percent [and] send _it_ [to] Pennsylvania . 
B|4| M: _Right ._ 
A|5| B: [Right .] But [the] point is is [that] businesses do [that] . The business [that] [you] purchase [the] thing from is responsible [for] collecting [the] appropriate _sales_ _tax_ [and] forwarding _it_ [to] [the] state _in_ question . That's _a_ cost _of_ doing business . The burden shouldn't be placed _on the_ consumer . 
B|6| M: Yes . 
A|7| B: Uh . 
B|8| M: If you're going [to] buy _something ,_ you're [not] going [to] [pay] [tax] [on] , [on] [it] 
A|9| B: Uh , do [you] mean businesses from [the] point _of_ view as , _of_ , _of_ selling [things] [to] _a_ consumer [and] then being responsible [for] _the sales_ [tax] ? Or purchasing . 
B|10| M: [I think] [it's] [, it's] [a] total waste [of] somebody's money . 
A|11| B: Yeah . See I'm unfamiliar with [that] because [I] [don't] [, I] never _see_ [that] end [of] [the] business . 
B|12| M: [Well [,] you] [don't] [see] [it] [in] [, you] [see] [it] [on [the] sales] , [in] [the] _, uh_ [in] [the] mail ? 
A|13| B: So , my only experience has been from [the] point [of] view [of] [a] consumer . Uh [, but] , if that's [the] case , if [the] business is responsible [for] policing themselves , then [I think] some well defined mechanisms need [to] be [in] place so [that [,] uh] , [the] opportunity [to] forget [that] [you] owe [sales] [tax] [for] [something [,] uh] , can be avoided . 
B|14| M: Uh-huh .
