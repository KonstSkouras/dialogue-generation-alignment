A|0| B: Huh-uh . 
B|1| M: _And_ , you're _not_ supposed _to_ put your _stuff_ _in_ _the_ garbage _, _and_ they_ _pick_ _it_ _up_ _at the_ curb , but you're supposed _to_ . 
A|2| B: they'll help _you_ , recycle , because _we_ , there is some bins , _like_ _behind_ Wal-Mart , _that_ _take_ some _things ._ 
B|3| M: _Oh_ , really ? 
A|4| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|5| M: _Oh_ _, I_ see . 
A|6| B: Because [I] finally asked because _, you_ know , _we_ had all of _those_ milk cartons [and] there _was_ nowhere else [to] _take them_ [and they] had [it] [in] front of Wal-Mart _and I_ ask [in] Wal-Mart [and they] said _they moved_ [it] _just_ _behind_ . 
B|7| M: [Yeah] _, [they_ moved] _the_ ones [that] _were_ _behind the_ counter _to the_ other ones , _too ._ 
A|8| B: Huh-uh . 
B|9| M: But , uh [, you] _just don't have the_ time _to do_ _it ._ 
A|10| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|11| M: So [we] went [and] took _it to the_ , uh _, _the_ city_ _, [and_ they] took [it] _up_ _to the city_ _. And_ , uh . 
A|12| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| M: Um _, and I_ can't even remember _what_ [they] call [those] [things .] 
A|14| B: Like aluminum cans ? 
B|15| M: [Yeah] _, I_ _, I_ [like] _to use_ [those] . 
A|16| B: _That's_ about [what] [we] [do] [too .] 
B|17| M: [Yeah] _, I_ , I've done [that] , [too .] I've made _like ,_ uh , _two_ _or_ three different ones _. I_ [just] _use_ plastic . 
A|18| B: Well [, I] guess , um , down [in] , kind of [in] North Dallas , there is _a_ place [that] will _take_ almost anything . 
B|19| M: Uh-huh . 
A|20| B: Uh [, I] [don't] , [we] [just don't have the] _room_ [to] store all [that] much [, you] know , 
B|21| M: [Yeah .] 
A|22| B: [I] [don't] want [to] be running down there every week , [or] whatever . 
B|23| M: Right . 
A|24| B: [Yeah .] 
B|25| M: _and _,_ and ,_ uh , _I'm_ sure [that] [the] more [we] learn _to do_ _with_ _it _,_ the_ more [it] seems [to] work _out_ . 
A|26| B: [Yeah .] 
B|27| M: [and] then [I] [just] throw [them] away [, you] can't [take them] . 
A|28| B: Those milk cartons [take] [up] so much _room_ . 
B|29| M: Right . 
A|30| B: [I] guess [we] kind of started recycling after [I] [moved] here about _a_ year _and a half_ ago . 
B|31| M: Uh-huh . 
A|32| B: We [were] using baby food [and] there _was_ so many baby food jars , kind of [what] started [it .] 
B|33| M: [Yeah .] 
A|34| B: Some of our neighbors [were] doing [it] [and] so [, you] know , when [I] found [out] some places [to] [take] [it [,] and ,] um , [like ,] um [, they] also [take] some [things] [at the] Flower Mound dump [behind the] fire station there [, and I] know [that] they're going [to use] [, you] know [, the] money for [that] [to] build some kind of multipurpose field [and] [that] type of thing . Put lights [and] [stuff] 
B|35| M: Uh-huh . 
A|36| B: so [, you] know , if [I'm] [not] going [to] get [the] money for aluminum [, I] _would_ [just] assume give [it [to the] city] of Flower Mound . [to do] something [with] [, you] know . 
B|37| M: Uh-huh . 
A|38| B: [Yeah .] _That's_ true [. And] [they] won't raise our taxes . 
B|39| M:  !!! % !! etwork !! Remind _me_ . 
A|40| B: [Yeah .] 
B|41| M: But , 
A|42| B: No [, I] [don't] [. I] _have a_ friend , of mine told [me] about this program , is [the] reason [that] [I'm] , 
B|43| M: _Oh_ , that's [a] neat idea . 
A|44| B: [Yeah .] 
B|45| M: [and] then [they] [would] put [you] [in] [a] different one [. And] then they'd [have a] , [a] special [room] _where_ [you] could drop [them] off [and] then [you] could go back [and] forth [. And] _it was_ _, it was_ really neat . 
A|46| B: is _talking to_ someone [in] Sorry . 
B|47| M: [Yeah] , it's okay _, it was nice_ [talking _to] you ._ 
A|48| B: She'll be [two] [in] July . 
B|49| M: _Oh_ , _my_ goodness . 
A|50| B: [Oh] . 
B|51| M: [and] she [was] [two] [and a half] [in] March . 
A|52| B: Well [, it was nice] [to] talk [to you [.] I] know they've started over [in] Richardson [where] [my] dad lives . They [pick] [up] newspapers [, I] think . 
B|53| M: Uh-huh . 
A|54| B: [Yeah .] 
B|55| M: [That's] good . 
A|56| B: Okay .
