B|3| M: _Uh-huh ._

More _than_ [they] _would_ _you know ,_ in areas where [they] 
B|11| M: [Yeah] 
A|12| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . That's true . 
B|13| M: [you _know ,] I_ don't [know ,] it's just [a _,] it_ seems _like _,_ _it_ , _it_ would [be_ more] [of] [a] challenge . 
A|14| B: _Right ._ 
B|15| M:  !!! etwork !! etwork ! etwe !! ; !! body !! Unless [you] work _for_ [a] company , 
A|16| B: [Yeah] . 
B|17| M: _I mean , _I_ think_ [a lot of] _people_ _are_ just totally , totally turned off [on the] test _.

A|18| B: That's hard [for] [me] [to] [say] since [I] [didn't] [, I] [didn't] _really_ grow , well when [I went] [to] elementary _school_ [it , it] wasn't in [a] great area but [I] still [, [I] mean , I] learned [to] read , started learning [to] read when [I] was in kindergarten [, [you] know] . 
B|19| M: [Uh-huh .]

B|21| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: You [know , I] guess [the] whole , [the] whole environment [and] attitude towards _school_ [and] learning _is_ different [for] [the] [people] . 
B|23| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| B: So [, I] guess [the] problem _is_ [the] , [the] thing [to do] _is_ [to try] [to _,] uh [,_ to] get some kind [of] motivation [to] learn [and] , 
B|25| M: [Yeah ,] yeah _, I [,_ I've _,] I have a lot of_ friends _that are_ teachers . 
A|26| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . [Uh-huh .] 
B|27| M: [And] [, uh] . 
A|28| B: No [, _I ,] I_ can't [say] [that] [I have] either . But _, uh ,_ 
B|29| M: [I , I] [would] [like to] go _to [a_ , a] [school] [that] has [more] [than] [one] teacher . 
A|30| B: [Yeah] . [I've [,] I've] heard some [, [I] mean] [I've] heard statistics [and] _things that , that_ compare [a] public education [to a] private education [. I mean] within [like ,] within [the] same _, uh ,_ income groups . 
B|31| M: Uh-uh . [Right .] 
A|32| B: If [you] compare [the] , [like] [the] [people] [that] [could] [have] _, that_ [could] [have] sent their kids [to] private schools [and] [the] [people] _that [,_ [you] know ,] [the] [people] _that , uh ,_ did send their kids [to] private schools . 
B|33| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| B: [I think] [they] compare [you know ,] fairly well . 
B|35| M: Well [, that's] [good] . 
A|36| B: [Yeah] [. [I] [, [I] [,] I] ,] my schools [, [I] mean ,] [there] [, I have a lot of] once , once [it] seemed [I] got into high [school] [, they] had [a lot of] _, uh ,_ accelerated programs [and] all kinds [of] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|37| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: That [, [I] mean _,] that_ makes [a] big difference cause [I] wondered when they're taking classes with _, uh ,_ with [people] [that are] _really_ , [are] interested in [the] , [the] subject [and] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|39| M: [Uh-huh .]
