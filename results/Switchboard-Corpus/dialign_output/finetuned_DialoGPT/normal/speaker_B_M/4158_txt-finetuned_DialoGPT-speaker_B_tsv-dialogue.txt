B|13| M: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
A|14| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| M: [but] [, um] 
A|16| B: If _you_ want _to_ , do [it] quickly . 
B|17| M: [and] you're [not] allowed [to] [take] your kids [out] [at] night . 
A|18| B: _Uh-huh_ , uh-huh [. [Yeah .] Yeah .] So [I] [, _I] don't know_ in , in terms of other things , other benefits other than sort of monetary I'd , _you know_ [, I] , _Yeah ,_ we , we do . We _have_ [to] contribute [a] certain amount [, _uh] ,_ [to] _it ._ 
B|19| M: [Right .] 
A|20| B: [And] [it's] kind of split between C M U [and] , [and] , _you know_ , _the_ employee . 
B|21| M: [Right .] 
A|22| B: [Right _.] Yeah ,_ [and] [it's] also [, right] now [it's [,] _uh] ,_ _the_ , like everywhere else [, _uh] ,_ here in Pittsburgh _the_ health care [, _uh] ,_ rates are , are going up pretty quickly . 
B|23| M: _Oh_ _, yeah ._ 
A|24| B: _That's_ [a] whole other topic [to] begin _with_ too [but] _. Yeah _,_ but_ [it's ,] _you_ are [right .] [I] [, I] [, I] _really_ agree _that _,_ that_ _that's_ pretty important . 
B|25| M: [Well [,] [that] [,] uh] _that's , that_ makes _a big_ difference . 
A|26| B: [Right .] 
B|27| M: [And] [I don't] [have] [a] real _big_ problem [with] , [with] [it .] 
A|28| B: [Right .] _Uh-huh_ [Oh] Now [that's] [a big] win .

A|30| B: [Yeah [,] yeah .] _That's_ , 
B|31| M: [Yeah .] 
A|32| B: [Yeah .] 
B|33| M: [I don't know] _if you_ [got] [the] Texas or [not] [, but] I've [got] [the] book .

B|35| M: [Oh] [, yeah] [, yeah] [That's] true . 
A|36| B: [Yeah ,] well [if you] could call [it] [a] benefit [that] C M U [, I] mean [the] other thing [that] _they_ allow [you] [to] do here while [you] are working [is] , [is] consult for [, um] , _you know_ , other companies . 
B|37| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| B: Um , so [that's , that] kind of helps [out] in terms of , _you know_ , keeping up-to-date [with] contacts in industry . 
B|39| M: [Right .] 
A|40| B: You [know] , in case , _you know_ , in case [you] ever need [to] bail [out] 
B|41| M: [Yeah [. Yeah] ,] [that's] true .
