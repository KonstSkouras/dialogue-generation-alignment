A|0| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Well_ _I_ am _a_ working mother _I_ _have_ three children _and_ _my_ children , since _I _,_ uh_ , since they were very young , I've had various , um , different alternatives , _child_ care arrangements _and_ like most working mothers _I'm_ really _not_ defensive about it _. I_ personally feel _, uh_ , in our particular situation _, I'm_ _a_ much better mother when _I work_ out _of_ _the_ _home_ _and_ _my_ kids _, I think ,_ are very , very secure , well raised children . My comment on this _is that_ we paid an absolute fortune over _the_ years for _a_ variety _of_ opportunities . 
B|1| M: _Well , I_ guess [, _I] mean_ _, _the_ _,_ the_ difficulty _with_ _that [is_ _that] [,_ uh] _you know_ _what_ [I'm] telling _you_ [is that] if , if _you're_ going _to_ _have a_ [child] who's going _to_ _be_ [a] _good_ parent _, you_ can't _just_ leave _them_ _at_ [home] . 
A|2| B: So _I _, I_ _, I_ [,_ [you] know] , it [is] [a] problem . _And ,_ but as [you] pointed out _, I , I think_ [the] real problem [is] [the] low pay [child] facilities _and_ [that is] sometimes [what] some women who [have] [to] _work_ , [that is] all they can afford . When our children were very young , we had [a] pay _, a_ live in paid baby-sitter [that] was wonderful . 
B|3| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] _that ._ 
A|4| B: _And_ then as they got older , they went [to] [, uh] [, I] preferred [to] call [them] schools _and_ they were really all day preschools _and_ they were wonderful . _And_ _I think_ they got exposed [to] [a] lot [of] neat _things ._ 
B|5| M: Uh-uh . 
A|6| B: But we did , we really truly did pay [a] fortune _. I mean_ we were paying [at] one point , well about , about _a ,_ close , about _five_ hundred dollars [a] week for two children . 
B|7| M: Wow . 
A|8| B: So . 
B|9| M: Wow . 
A|10| B: [Well , I] [I'm] [a] physician . _Uh_ _and ,_ as [is] _my_ husband . 
B|11| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| B: _And ,_ _and I_ felt [, uh] , very [good] about working . [I'm] [a] pediatrician actually . 
B|13| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| B: So [, uh] , but _I think_ there are some wonderful [child] care opportunities out there for children but , _and_ we all [know] [the] kind [of] _things_ [that] [you're] supposed [to] look for _. _I_ think ,_ 
B|15| M: _Uh _,_ what_ _type_ [of] [work] _do_ [you] _do_ ? 
A|16| B: _Oh_ . [Well] 
B|17| M: [I mean] [, I [,] I'm] [not] [a] career person [. I mean] [I'm] [, [I] work] full _time_ [and I] travel [, I] _do_ _that [,_ I] travel [and I] _do_ other [things .] 
A|18| B: _I think_ it's real important [that] [you] [have a] place [that ,] first [of] all parents [have a] lot [of] input into [and] [that] _they're_ always welcome [and] [that] they [have a] lot [of] activities where parents come in during [the] day [and] [that] [at] any [time] [you] can drop in . _And_ we had [a] really wonderful arrangement [, uh] [, I'm] [with] [the] university actually 
B|19| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: [and] they had [a] wonderful [, uh] , program [that] started [at] age three [and] it was about [a] block away from [the] hospital where [I work] . _And_ _so_ , many times , [at] lunchtime [, I] would go over [and] visit [the] children [and] eat [with] [them] [and] _see_ [what] they were doing . _And_ they had wonderful , they had [things] like gardens [and] lots [of] pets [and] [just] , they had [a] four [to] one [uh] , teacher student ratio . 
B|21| M: _Uh ,_ that's _great_ . 
A|22| B: So [that ,] [that] sort [of] an , most [of] [the] teachers had degrees . [Uh ,] 
B|23| M: _Yeah_ , yeah [, I , I think] that's [a [,] a] [good] thing . 
A|24| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|25| M: [And [,] uh] . 
A|26| B: It was incredible actually 
B|27| M: [Oh] [, I] [know] . 
A|28| B: But it was [good] [. I mean] it was , it , [at] [that] [time] there were two children [and] they were in special programs [and] each one was [a] little over two hundred [a] week [and] then , in addition [, I] paid [a] little bit extra . But [the] kids were , 
B|29| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| B: [I mean] they really had some [great] opportunities . But [, what] [you] were alluding [to] earlier [is] [, [you] know] , women who [work] for minimal wage _and ,_ [and] really [have] feel they [have] [to] put their children , 
B|31| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|32| B: sometimes they [do] put [them] in [, uh] , fairly low paying situations . 
B|33| M: [Yeah] _, I think [, I_ , I] agree [with] _that ._ 
A|34| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| M: [and ,] [you're] [not] going [to] [see] _that ._ 
A|36| B: [Uh-huh .] No , even [that ,] [that] really [, I think , I] don't , it's been awhile since I've looked [at] _, my_ youngest [child] [is] eight . So it's been [a] little while since I've looked into , actually daycare centers . But they are 
B|37| M: [Yeah .] 
A|38| B: [you know] [, the] [good] ones [do] cost maybe sixty dollars [a] week since . 
B|39| M: [Oh] [, my] goodness . 
A|40| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [so] that's [a] pretty [good] savings . 
A|42| B: Something like [that .] 
B|43| M: [Yeah] [, I think] [they're] up [to] [five] . 
A|44| B: [Well [,] [you] know] , but [you] made [the] comment earlier , why would someone [be] interested in children [. I mean] it has been [a] real [, uh] , there [have] been some [good] entrepreneurial [type] experiences . [And] [I think [, I] think] they [have] captured [a] certain market . Again [the ,] but then there are baby-sitting groups . As [a] pediatrician , one [of] [the] [things] we've been real concerned about [is] [the] infections . 
B|45| M: Uh-uh . Right . 
A|46| B: As [you] start putting lots [of] little kids together [, the] infection rates [that] go around 
B|47| M: [Uh] .
