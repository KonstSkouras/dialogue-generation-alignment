B|4| M: Uh-uh . [Yeah] . 
A|5| B: _it's_ , 
B|6| M: That _, _that_ would be_ _great_ . 
A|7| B: everybody _just_ says _how_ wonderful _it_ is _, _and_ it's_ _it's_ _like , uh ,_ yes , 
B|8| M: _It's_ _not_ as _good_ as [it] _could_ _be_ . 
A|9| B: [I] . 
B|10| M: [That's , that's] [, uh] . 
A|11| B: [That's] one _of those_ things [I] got famous [for] _in_ college . People [would] come _and_ say [could] [would] _you_ come over _and_ _make_ lasagna [for me]

B|16| M: [Yeah] . 
A|17| B: [I like] doing [that] kind [of] stuff . 
B|18| M: [Yeah ,] so you'd _be_ surprised _at_ [how] _much_ _, how_ _much_ [you] [do] . 
A|19| B: [And] [it's] [, it's] _fun_ , _in_ fact [that's] what _we_ had [for] [a] Christmas party last week . 
B|20| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|21| B: We _just_ had [a] bunch [of] [people] over [and] _we_ had , _we_ did lasagna [and] garlic bread [and] _, uh ,_ yummy .

B|24| M: [Uh] . 
A|25| B: [Oh .] _Oh ,_ _good ._ 
B|26| M: _And [,_ uh] 
A|27| B: _Uh ,_ actually one thing _we_ [have done] quite [a] _bit_ through _the_ holidays , _just_ because _it's a ,_ real easy , is _just_ _baked potato_ dinners . 
B|28| M:  !!! _you're_ _my_ favorite 
A|29| B: [And] [have] _, you know ,_ [like] _three_ _or_ four couples come over _, and_ I'll [do] _the_ potatoes _and _you_ know ,_ [like] _butter_ [and] cheese [and] stuff [and] [have] everybody else _just_ bring [a] couple [of] toppings , whatever they [like] 
B|30| M: Uh-hue . 
A|31| B: [and] [it] turns _out_ [great] , because _I mean ,_ you've got [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue [and] _, you know ,_ bacon [and] all [that] [good] stuff . 
B|32| M: [Uh [,] uh ,] 
A|33| B: _But_ [it's] [, it's] inexpensive 
B|34| M: [Yeah] . 
A|35| B: plus [it's] real easy _on the_ hostess , because _you can_ _just_ [have] _the_ potatoes ready _, and_ _just_ _have a_ salad _with_ _it _,_ and you_ got [a] [great] dinner . 
B|36| M: [Oh _,] that_ sounds [great] . 
A|37| B: [It's] [, it's] real easy _, [I_ like] doing [that] part . 
B|38| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|39| B: _I'm_ _in_ favor [of] very _little_ clean _up _, um_ ,_ very _little_ planning because we've got _three_ _or_ four couples [that] _we_ get together _with_ [to] play games , 
B|40| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|41| B: [and it's] , 
B|42| M: [Yeah _,] I _,_ I've_ seen some [of those] , [too] . 
A|43| B: _we_ invariably end _up_ [at] [my] house since [I've] got two kids . 
B|44| M: [Uh ,] oh _, yeah [,_ that's] true . 
A|45| B: [And] [that] [, it's] [, it's] fine , because _then_ [I] _can_ _just_ say , Okay fine _, you_ bring this _, you_ bring this _, you_ bring this , we're [done] . 
B|46| M: [Right .] 
A|47| B: [And] [it's] pretty cool . 
B|48| M: [It's] _a lot_ [of] [fun] . 
A|49| B: [Uh-huh .] [Oh .] 
B|50| M:  !!! % !! translated Well _, that_ sounds [good .] 
A|51| B: [Oh .] 
B|52| M: _And [,_ uh _,] that_ _way_ [you] don't _have to_ [make] _a lot_ [of] mess . 
A|53| B: [Oh [,] I] love [it] 
B|54| M: Uh-uh . 
A|55| B: _Um_ . 
B|56| M: [and you] [, and you] cover _it with [,_ uh [,] you know ,] angel food cake _and _put_ in_ raspberry , uh-huh . 
A|57| B: Over _the_ uncooked _rice_ ? 
B|58| M: [Yeah] . 
A|59| B: [Oh .] 
B|60| M: _yeah ,_ 
A|61| B: [Oh [,] how] neat . 
B|62| M: _And [,_ uh ,] [then] [you can] also [make] [it] _ahead_ [of] time [and [you] can] _put_ [it] [on the] next plate _and _then_ just_ cover [it .] 
A|63| B: Huh . Now [I've] [done [it] with ,] where _you put_ [, _you] cook_ [the] _well [,_ _I] guess_ [you] probably _could do it_ same [way] [, but] [cook] _the rice_ [and then] _take_ [a] [can] [of] [like] cream [of] mushroom soup _or_ cream [of] _chicken_ soup [, [and] put] _a little bit of_ white wine [in] [it .] 
B|64| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|65| B: [And] every once [in] [a] while , I'll [put in] , I'll slice white grapes [and] I'll [put in] there [, and] [, that's] [just] because _I'm not_ [a] real big wine person [but] [I like] _it , it_ adds something [to] [the] _chicken_ . 
B|66| M: [Oh _,] that_ sounds [good .] 
A|67| B: [And] [then just] bake _it [,_ and] [it] makes [a] wonderful sauce over _the rice_ . 
B|68| M: [Oh _,] that_ sounds [good .] 
A|69| B: [Yeah] 
B|70| M: [I] _just put_ [that] [in] [my] thinking _for when_ [we] _do that_ again . 
A|71| B: [It's] [, that] _was_ one [of] [the] first things [I] made [for] [my] husband , because [I] _was like _,_ um [,_ yeah] 
B|72| M: [Yeah [,] I] _know ._ 
A|73| B: _I could_ actually find something _I could_ [cook] real easy [that would be] kind [of] sort [of] elegant kind [of] 
B|74| M: [Yeah _,] I've_ tried _to do that_ _. I_ don't [know] _if [I_ [could] do it] anymore . 
A|75| B: [Oh [,] yeah] . 
B|76| M: [But] [, um] . 
A|77| B: [But] [then] [, I] hadn't thought _about_ doing [it with] uncooked _rice_ . 
B|78| M: [Uh [,] well ,] [I'm not] sure [how] [you] [would] [, uh ,] [cook] [it _,] I mean [,_ I] [would] [just] [make] [it] [like] [a] [rice] dish [, you] [take] [the rice] [out] [of] [a] [rice] cooker [, [you] put] [the rice] [in _the] [,_ uh] [you know _,] with the_ melted [butter] [, [and] then] [you cook] [it] [on] high [for] [about] thirty minutes . 
A|79| B: So , [just] , [like] [in] [a] thirteen by nine pan . 
B|80| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|81| B: _Um_ . 
B|82| M: [it's a [,] [it's] a] [rice] dish [with [,] um ,] [put in] [like] [a little bit of] _chopped_ [up , um] . 
A|83| B: _Um_ . 
B|84| M: [it] [was [like ,] uh ,] [three] quarter cup [of] water . 
A|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|86| M: [Um] _, I , I_ don't _know _._ [I_ guess] [I'm not] [really] _into_ [the] whole [, uh ,] metric system as _much_ as I'd [like] [to] . 
A|87| B: [Yeah [,] yeah [,] I , I] _use_ [that] [for] [for] [rice] [and] [for when] [I] [cook] pasta _or_ something , I'll [put] [a little bit of] bouillon [in] there [just] [to] give [it] [a little] extra flavor . 
B|88| M: [Oh [,] that] sounds [good .] 
A|89| B: [Um] . Now [that would be] [good .] 
B|90| M: Uh-uh _. I_ [have [a] recipe] [for] [that] . 
A|91| B: How _long_ [do] [you] [have to] bake [it] ? 
B|92| M: [Uh [,] it's] [not] [, it] doesn't [, [it] , it] takes [a] [long] time . 
A|93| B: [I] [do] [, I] [do] microwave [too] _, [a_ lot] 
B|94| M: [Yeah] . 
A|95| B: How [long] [would] [it] [be] [how] [long] [would] [it] [be] [in the] microwave ? 
B|96| M: [I] don't _know ._ 
A|97| B: [Oh ,] okay . Okay . Do [you] [just] brown [the] _chicken_ [to] get [it] colored 
B|98| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|99| B: _or_ [do] [you] go [ahead] [and] let [it] [cook] through ? 
B|100| M: [Uh [,] [you] can] either [use] [chicken] [or] [, uh [,] you know [,] a] [baked potato] . 
A|101| B: [Um] . Ooh , this is [a] beneficial call [. [I] like] this 
B|102| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|103| B: [Yeah , but] [that] one's an easy one . [It's] [like ,] [just [put] in] [, a] friend [of] mine makes [it] where she goes [ahead] [and] seasons [up] [the [,] with the] soup [and] [the] wine 
B|104| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|105| B: [put in] garlic [and] onion powder [or] [chopped] onions [if] [you] want [to do that] [, you [know] .] What ever , however [much] effort [you] feel [like] putting [into] [it .] 
B|106| M: [Uh [,] yeah [,] that's] true . 
A|107| B: [But] [it , it] makes [a] [great] [, I mean [,] I've] got [a] two year old [and] [a] four year old [and] they love [it .] 
B|108| M: [Uh [,] well [,] that's] [good .] 
A|109| B: [And ,] because [my] daughter calls [it] her gravy [and] [I mean ,] she thinks [it's] wonderful , [my] , [good] , [you're] [a] picky eater , [if I] [can] get [you] [to] ,
