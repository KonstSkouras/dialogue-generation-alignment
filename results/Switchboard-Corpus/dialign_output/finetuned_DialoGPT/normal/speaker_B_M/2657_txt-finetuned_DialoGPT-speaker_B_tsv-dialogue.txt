A|4| B: _That's true ._ 
B|5| M: _And _,_ uh_ _I think that_ we've , we've learned _a_ great deal _from_ _it ._ 
A|6| B: Um , _me_ either _. I , I_ went [to] college [and] then started working [and] then _got_ married [and ,] 
B|7| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|8| B: No [, I] haven't _, I know [that_ , uh ,] my sister [, I] _have a_ twin sister [and] _when_ _they_ graduated _she_ went [to [,] uh ,] teach _in_ [a] small town down _in_ south Texas [and] _I know [,_ that] _like_ _if [you_ have] college notes , _if you_ teach _in_ [a] lower income bracket where _they don't_ pay as much [and] _they_ cancel part [of] your _, you know ,_ your college note or whatever . 
B|9| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|10| B: [Uh-huh .] If _it's like , you know ,_ [really] _a _,_ you know _,_ a_ lower paying job _, you know ,_ where _in_ [a] small town [you] [don't] obviously [you] [don't] _need_ as much as far as _to _, you_ know [,_ to] live . 
B|11| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|12| B: _Yeah _,_ _she_ only_ taught _there_ _one_ year _but [I_ ,] 
B|13| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me] . 
A|14| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|15| M: _Well [,_ she] [got] _some_ _money_ _from_ _the_ school _, _but_ I think_ [she only] had [a] portion [of] _it ._ 
A|16| B: [And _,] um [, I_ think] [it] _would be_ _, I know that_ also _one of_ my cousins who [, uh ,] he _is_ _in_ _like_ [the] therapy type _thing_ [and] he _was_ _, um ,_ [some] group paid part [of] his college income [but] then he _was_ required _to go_ back [and] work for [a] certain number [of] years _in_ this town at [, uh _,] uh [, I_ mean _,] it's a_ nursing home or _something_ _like_ _that ._ 
B|17| M: Uh , uh-homing 
A|18| B: So _, you know ,_ _if_ _, I think _that's_ a_ _good_ _way_ for [people] _to _, you_ know ,_ maybe get [people] [to] come back [to] these small towns [to] work by helping [people] [that] normally might _not_ _be_ able _to go_ [to] college [and] get [the] type [of] degree _they_ _want_ . 
B|19| M: Uh-uh _. Yeah ._ 
A|20| B: [Yeah .] As far as _yeah ,_ getting doctors [and] all [that] stuff _, yeah_ . 
B|21| M: _Well _,_ _it_ _,_ it_ depends _on_ [the] doctor [. [I] mean] [if _you] _want_ _to_ go into_ [a] profession [, [you] _have] to be_ willing [to _go] out [and_ [,] uh] 
A|22| B: [Yeah .] 
B|23| M: _but [,_ uh ,] 
A|24| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: _But_ [it's] [not] [a ,] you're right [, it's a] major medical problem _, but_ [it's] [something] [that] needs _to be_ addressed _, [and_ [,] uh _,] and_ [it's] _going _to_ be_ [a] big [, uh ,] 
A|26| B: [Yeah .] 
B|27| M: _But_ , 
A|28| B: [I really] _don't _know_ that_ much about [it _,] you know [, I_ [, I] [, I] think] _of _the_ Peace_ Corps _, you know ,_ _more_ _like_ [the] sixties [and] [that] _kind of_ stuff _when_ , 
B|29| M:  !!! % !! clamation point !! Remind [me] [of] [that [.] I] used _to _do_ that_ quite [a] bit [when] [I] [was] _in [the_ Peace] corps , you're right . 
A|30| B: [Yeah .] [And] [don't] _they_ [go into] _other_ countries [and] stuff ? 
B|31| M:  !!!!,!! clamation !! _There_ !! 
A|32| B: [Uh-huh .] Things [that] _make_ [the] _, yeah_ . Make _them_ _more_ self-supporting ? 
B|33| M: [Yeah _,] yeah ,_ [make] [them] self-starters . 
A|34| B: [Yeah .] 
B|35| M: [they] , [they] , _they [have_ a] very [, uh] 
A|36| B: _Right [._ Yeah .] 
B|37| M: [And [,] uh [,] you know [, I] think] [, uh] . 
A|38| B: [But] [it] definitely _would_ give [a lot _of] the_ kids now [that] [have] everything given [to] [them] [that] [they] [want to] see _what_ _it's like_ [if you] _don't have_ all [the] [money] [and] _can't_ [have] _what_ [you want] [when] [you want] [it .] 
B|39| M: [Yeah .] [That's true .] That _, that's_ [true] [, [that] [,] that] [really] [is] [true .] 
A|40| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| M: [and [,] um [, [I] know] [,] um] . 
A|42| B: [Yeah .] 
B|43| M: _I think _that_ [would_ be] [a] [really] [good] [thing] _to do_ . 
A|44| B: [I don't] _, I don't _know_ that_ [you] _could_ require everyone [to ,] [do that] for [, yeah [,] _to] do it_ for [a] _whole_ year , or two years or [something] _like_ [that ,] 
B|45| M: [Yeah _,] that's_ [true .] 
A|46| B: _I don't _know_ that_ [that would] work [if] , somebody's , [was] , didn't [really] [want [to] be] _there_ [and] didn't [have] , 
B|47| M: [Yeah ,] well _, that's_ [true .] 
A|48| B: [Yeah [,] I mean ,] _there_ [would be] loopholes _just_ _like_ _there_ [is] [in] anything else 
B|49| M: [Yeah .] 
A|50| B: [Yeah .] 
B|51| M: [And [,] uh [,] you] [just] [don't] [want _to] go into_ [that .] 
A|52| B: [Yeah .] 
B|53| M: [And] [that's] [the] [way] _they're_ _going [to_ do [it] .] 
A|54| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: [And _,] and that's_ _, that's_ [one [of] the] problems . 
A|56| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: [And [,] uh ,] [they] [, uh] _they're_ very , very [, uh] ... 
A|58| B: _Right_ [, yeah] . 
B|59| M: [But] _they're_ _in the_ process [of] being , 
A|60| B: [Yeah ,] uh-huh . 
B|61| M: They're [, uh] 
A|62| B: [Yeah .] 
B|63| M: [And] _I mean [, I_ ,] _I'm_ _, I guess_ _I'm_ [kind of] old-fashioned too [. _I] think [that_ , uh] 
A|64| B: [Yeah .] 
B|65| M: [But] [, uh] . 
A|66| B: [Yeah .] 
B|67| M: [I don't [know] , I] don , _I'm_ _, I guess_ _I'm_ cynical [of the] [whole] [thing] _, [but_ I] don [think] [there] _could be_ [a] [more] permanent solution [to] [it .] 
A|68| B: [Well ,] Down here _with [the_ Peace] Corps we're talking about all these [people] [that] aren't even [in] our own country [when] [there's] enough [people] here [that I think] probably _need_ [help] [and ,] [could be] helped . 
B|69| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| B: [Yeah .] 
B|71| M: [But] [, _I mean [,] I_ think that's] [, I don't [know] _,] [that's_ [a] [,] [that] [,] that] [is] [a [,] a] problem [with _the] United States [._ [I] think] [it's a] big problem [. I] don t understand why _the United_ Nations [, uh ,] why [they [don't] _have] more_ input [into] [it [.] [I] mean] [I [,] [it's] like , you know ,] why [not] , why , why we [don't] [want] [some] assistance . 
A|72| B: [And] maybe rather than [just] , require somebody [to] join [like] [the Peace] Corps for [a] year maybe [like [,] um ,] during college [, you know ,] maybe [have] [some] [kind of] course where they'd [be] required [to do] [some] [kind of] community service type work [, and] [help people] [in] [that] area or [people] [in [the] United States .] 
B|73| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [There] probably _are_ [, you know ,] for [but] [I'm] sure [, that's] probably [like] [people] [that] [do that] _are_ , _are_ [the] [people] [that] _are_ [going [to] go into] social work [and] stuff [but [I think] that] [it] wouldn't [really] [be] half bad for everybody [not] [to do] [something] [, you know [,] and] realize [it's] everybody's responsibility [to [,] um ,] [help] these [people] [, you know [,] and] [I'm] [not] saying [just] give _them money_ [but [,] I mean ,] because [they [have] to be] taught [to be] , 
B|75| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|76| B: [Yeah] [I mean [, I] know] [that's] _what_ my father-in-law [was] talking about [, you know ,] [when] [you] give these [people] [money] or _, what_ [was] [it] [they] were bringing up points asking as far as whether _they need_ [to] give [, um ,] [more] _money to_ these [people] [, I mean [,] and that's] [not] [really] [the] answer [, I mean ,] because [if] [they're] alcoholics they'll [just] [go out and] spend [, it] [on] [, you know ,] booze or [something] [like] [that ,] 
B|77| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| B: [but] . 
B|79| M: That [, [that] [,] that] [is] [the] [whole] _thing [._ I [, I] don't know] . 
A|80| B: [Yeah .] 
B|81| M: [you know [,] what] [if you] gave [them [money] to] clean [out] their closets [and] tell [them] [they need] [some] lube ? 
A|82| B: Or [, you know [,] to] find [a] job where [they] can learn how [to] support themselves , 
B|83| M: [Right .] 
A|84| B: [I mean [, I] guess] we're getting [kind of] off [the] subject , here [, but] . 
B|85| M: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|86| B: [Yeah [,] I mean] [it's] , True [. Yeah .] 
B|87| M: It's [not] [like] [they're] [going [to] , you] [can't] , 
A|88| B: [Yeah .] 
B|89| M: [And [,] uh , I] don [, I know that] [there] [are] [a lot of] [other] organizations [that] [could] [do [it] .] 
A|90| B: Flower Mound [, yeah] . So , we're [a] little [you know ,] farther removed [from] [like] Dallas [and] [some] [of the] areas where [they] probably [have more] [of the] homeless [and] [that] type [of] [thing .] 
B|91| M: [Right .]
