B|3| M: _Well ,_ _it_ [was] . 
A|4| B: Right . _So _,_ what_ _what_ _is_ _the _E_ _P_ A_ recommending _now_ ? 
B|5| M: _Well_ [E P] [a] _has_ been _doing_ [a] lot _of_ _, uh_ _you_ know _, a_ lot more research , _and , uh_ _and_ _they_ have , _they_ have _really_ , _really_ _, uh_ ... 
A|6| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|7| M: And _, uh , [the_ E] S [P A] [was] [the] _one_ [that] said [that] _they_ should have been more involved _with the_ war . 
A|8| B: _Yeah_ . 
B|9| M: _and , uh_ _they_ were saying _that , uh_ [the] _waste_ [is] not being _recycled ._ It's being burned . 
A|10| B: Right . That's [a] , _that's_ [a] common problem though . That [it] seems _, that_ [has] happened _in_ Dallas as [well] as New York [and] [I] [try] _to_ recycle all _of the_ newspapers [that] come _to_ my house [and] after [a] while [I] _just_ quit taking _the newspaper_ _because_ [I] couldn't recycle [it] anymore which isn't good _for_ business on [the] other end _either_ [, I] suppose . 
B|11| M: [Yeah] , I've , I'm not [a] real big fan [of [the] newspaper] [either] . 
A|12| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|13| M: And _they're_ trying [to] start _putting_ [the] recycling _in the_ , _in the_ bins out front _and ,_ [and] [the] _like_ . 
A|14| B: Right . 
B|15| M: _and , uh_ . 
A|16| B: [Well ,] _that's_ good . 
B|17| M: [So ,] 
A|18| B: Right . There [has] [to] be [, uh [,] a] reuse _for_ _it _._ I_ mean , _that's_ why [they] recycle . The [one] _I think_ [is] [the] most interesting [is] [with the] [recycled] bottles [and] all [that [, uh] , the] industry seems [to] be [doing] [with the] [recycled] polymers . _Uh ,_ everything from [, uh ,] [waste] baskets [to] carpet [to] [the] no stick [, I] mean [the] sticky slide rugs under [the] carpet 
B|19| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|20| B: [and [, uh] _,] I think_ [they] are even [putting] [it] [in the] roadways these days [and] [they're] making clothes _now_ [that] are [recycled .] Like [the] [recycled] plastic coke bottles [and] [and] milk cartons [and] things [like] [that .] 
B|21| M: [Uh ,] [they] have those [in the] [, uh] [in the] parks . 
A|22| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|23| M: _so_ , he went [in] [and ,] [and] he got [the] engineering major [and] he proved [that [,] that] he could do [it] by [just] using [the] engineering degree . 
A|24| B: Oh [really] . 
B|25| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] [that] 
A|26| B: Right . 
B|27| M: _but_ [, uh] 
A|28| B: Huh . 
B|29| M: [So [,] I] [, I think] [that's] [the] major [, uh ,] _change_ [is] [that , uh] . 
A|30| B: [Well ,] it's carbon [so] [that] makes sense , [like] [a] carbon fuel [of] some sort _, but_ _what_ _what_ _about_ emissions ? 
B|31| M: [Uh ,] _yeah_ _. [Well_ [,] I] don't know how [they] would , how they'd do [it] [with] gasoline [. I] guess they'd have [to] burn [it] 
A|32| B: Oh . 
B|33| M: And , [and] he didn tinker [with] [it .] He , he tinker [, but] [, but] he didn , _you_ know , [it] , [it] [was] , [it] got , [it] wasn't , [it] [didn't] get anywhere near [what] he [was] trying [to] do . 
A|34| B: Okay 
B|35| M: [Well [,] what] do _you_ [think] [of] [, uh , the] space shuttle landing ? 
A|36| B: _No_ [. Well] it's interesting [. _I] bet_ [that] [was] [a] good day , at [the] [yeah] , conference then . 
B|37| M: [Yeah] [, [I] bet] [it] [was] . 
A|38| B: Did [it] [change] anything _for_ [you] ? 
B|39| M: [No] , not [really] , [because] I've had [it] [for] , [you] know , I've been [in] this [for] [, I] guess [about] three years [now] .
