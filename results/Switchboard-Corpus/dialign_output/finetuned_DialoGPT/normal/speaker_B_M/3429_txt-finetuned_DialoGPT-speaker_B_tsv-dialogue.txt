A|8| B: [and] . 
B|9| M: _Yeah ,_ _I've_ seen _a lot_ _of_ change _, I think_ . 
A|10| B: [I think] so . 
B|11| M: _Yeah _, I think_ _that's_ ,_ uh , 
A|12| B: [I think] so _, and_ [a lot] [, I think] people _are ,_ _are_ used _to_ now saying _what's_ , _what's_ on their minds _more_ _more_ up front _than_ _they_ used _to_ _be ._ 
B|13| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|14| B: _Right ._ 
B|15| M:  !!! % !! RemindMe !! ets !! 
A|16| B: [Yeah , I think] so . [I think] women have come out _more_ _too_ , on , on like child abuse [and _,] and_ the wife beatings , 
B|17| M: Uh-hue . 
A|18| B: [and] [and] like _you_ said , pro pro-choice [and] whatnot . 
B|19| M: [Right .] [Right] [, I] agree _with_ [you] . 
A|20| B: [I think that's] become _more_ outstanding _than_ it used _to_ _be_ where women [, I think] used _to_ _be_ [a] little bit afraid [of] coming out [and] saying something . 
B|21| M: [Right .] 
A|22| B: No , huh-uh . 
B|23| M: _And_ [, _and] I _think_ that_ [that's] probably _going to_ happen . 
A|24| B: [Right .] Well [, I] _know_ like when [I] was in high school [and] junior high [and] stuff [and] sitting down [and] having the sex talk [with] mom , [you] _know_ [and] all [that] stuff , 
B|25| M: _Uh-huh ._ Uh-hue . 
A|26| B: [and ,] [you] _know_ , we didn't have [to] talk about , well basically her thing was just _don't_ _do_ it , [you] _know_ 
B|27| M: Uh . 
A|28| B: _but _,_ I'm_ not _, I'm_ not naive , [to] [think that] my children _are_ not [going to] not _do_ it . 
B|29| M: [Right .] 
A|30| B: It wasn't [that] long [that] [I] was [that] young . 
B|31| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|32| B: [And] [I've] got [a] ten year old [, [and] ,] [you] _know_ , he _thought_ , he knows about condoms [, and] [and] he knows about AIDS , 
B|33| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|34| B: [and] _it's_ just different _things_ [you] have [to] talk [to] them about now [that] _you would_ never even have dreamt [to] have [to] say anything about . 
B|35| M: [Right .] 
A|36| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| M: [but ,] uh _, it's_ hard [to] [know] _what_ we're doing _because_ _I don't know_ [what's] [going to] happen . 
A|38| B: No _, I don't_ [, I think that's] stupidity on parents' part . _I mean_ [that's ,] sex is rampant , 
B|39| M: [Yeah] . 
A|40| B: [and] it always will _be_ [, and] [and _I think] ,_ _too_ , noticing the kids , [that] the fourth [and] fifth graders , which is [what] my son is [and] stuff , _they_ , they're just , they're _more_ , they're very open . 
B|41| M: Uh-uh . Uh-hue . 
A|42| B: _I mean ,_ the boys _are_ very open [because] [that's [,] that's] all [I] have is boys , so [that's] all _I'm_ _around_ basically , is boys , 
B|43| M: Uh-hues . 
A|44| B: [but] _they_ talk about _things_ [that] _I ,_ my brother didn't talk about until he was in college [you] [know] , 
B|45| M: [Right .] 
A|46| B: [and [,] and] _they_ sit down [and] _they_ look at [you] right in the face [and] _they_ expect [a] truthful answer . 
B|47| M: [Right .] 
A|48| B: You can't get them , give them , the , oh , [you] [know] , Cabbage Patch answers [and] stuff . 
B|49| M: [Right .] 
A|50| B: They , _they_ , [that] just does not go . 
B|51| M: _I think , I think_ [they] [are [,] [I] [,] _I don't] know_ . 
A|52| B: [And] [they] can tell me , basically some _things_ [that] [I don't know] 
B|53| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| B: But it [, it's] interesting , listening [to] them . [I think , I think] the social changes in them [, I think] [I] see it _more_ [with] [that] generation _than _I_ do_ [with] like our generation . 
B|55| M: Uh _, I do too ._ 
A|56| B: [Yeah [, I] do too .] 
B|57| M: [I mean [,] I] don tinker [around] [with] [things] , [but] [I'm] [, I'm] [more] [than] likely [to] , you're [more] [than I] [thought] [you would] [be .]
