B|40| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|41| B: Well _, I , I_ _just_ _think _that_ _, uh_ _,_ you know ,_ at [that] when , when they were _you know ,_ the , those were all brothers _and_ sisters _a_ lot _and_ or they were all in the same geographical location .

B|50| M: [Uh [,] well , [I] know] [my mother's] always worked [and [I] know] [how] important [it is] [to] [have a] _family ._
