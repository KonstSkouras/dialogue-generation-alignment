B|1| M: And _, uh_ 
A|2| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|3| M: And _, uh ,_ _so_ _, it's , it_ _, I_ _think_ _it's_ real important _that _,_ uh_ you _know_ you _do it_ _right_ , _because_ _it_ builds character . 
A|4| B: Oh , _really_ ? 
B|5| M: [Yeah .]

B|7| M: And _, uh_ they _do_ _a_ lot _of , uh_ they _do_ _, uh_ you _know_ watching the T V _and_ stuff . 
A|8| B: _Right_ . 
B|9| M: But _, uh ,_ 
A|10| B: To put her _in a_ rest home ? 
B|11| M: [Right] , yeah . 
A|12| B: Um , well , see [it's] more _my_ grandma [that] feels [that] _way_ . 
B|13| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| B: She says [that] when her husband died [that] he said , oh , [that] _my_ uncle had said [that] he would never put her _in a_ rest home . So [it's] kind [of _, uh] , _I_ don't_ [know] . _I mean [,_ _I] don't_ [, _I] don't think_ _my_ parents would but she _is_ getting pretty bad _like_ she has _to have_ _like_ [a] little toilet [right] _by_ her bed _and [,_ it's ,] 
B|15| M: Uh , _how_ old [is] your granddaughter ? 
A|16| B: _and my_ mom has _to_ take care [of] her pretty much [so] [it] gets [, _I] don't_ [know] . It's [, it's] [a] hard decision , but _I don't think_ [I] would [do it] _to_ _my_ parents personally 
B|17| M: Uh , 
A|18| B: When he retired ? 
B|19| M: Uh , about _three months_ ago . 
A|20| B: [Yeah] [, it's] _like_ [that] good _for_ us _just_ [because] _my_ uncle _and my_ _, and my_ mom switch off _like_ we _have_ her _for_ [three months] [and] then he has her _for_ [three months] . 
B|21| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| B: So [that ,] [that] works _out_ good . 
B|23| M: [Yeah .] 
A|24| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: But [, uh ,] you [know] _, I'm_ [, I] [have] two girls [and [,] [and] [,] uh] _I'm_ going [to have] [to] quit [because] [I] [just] [, I] [just] [don't] want [to] work . 
A|26| B: Really ? 
B|27| M: [and] _I'm_ sure [that] they'll be at least somewhat better . 
A|28| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| M: we're going , either we're both going [to] live [in a] big house or we're _not_ going [to] [do] anything . 
A|30| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| M: And , you're _not_ going [to] feel [like] you're [out] [of] the house . 
A|32| B: You [think] ? _I [,_ I] [I'm] [not] _really_ familiar with [how] other countries , 
B|33| M: Well [, I] [think] [, [I] ,] um _, I'm_ from the [, I] was raised [in] the south [, [and] [,] uh , I] lived [in] the [, uh] Texas , area [for] [a] while [and [,] and my] mother [and] father were both from [that] area [, and] they were [, uh] they were very similar people . 
A|34| B: They're seen as senile 
B|35| M: [and [,] [and] [,] uh [,] and] that's , that's the [way] they're perceived [, I] guess , [by] people [in] the country . But , um . 
A|36| B: [Right] . 
B|37| M: [I don't think] people [really] respect the , the [, uh ,] the social changes [that] [have] occurred , 
A|38| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| M: And [, uh ,] [so] _it's , it_ _, it_ [is] _, it really is_ [a] problem . 
A|40| B: [Right] . 
B|41| M: [I mean ,] they're , you [know] , they , they've got [to have] [that] . 
A|42| B: [Uh-huh .] [I] [know] . 
B|43| M: But [, uh ,] 
A|44| B: Um [, I'm] twenty . 
B|45| M: Twenty-two .
