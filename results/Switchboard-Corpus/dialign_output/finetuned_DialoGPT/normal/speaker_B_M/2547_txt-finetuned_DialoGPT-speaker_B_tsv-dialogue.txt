B|3| M:  !!! ; !! % !! RemindMe !! ets !! eting !! 
A|4| B: But _it's_ upper middle class _, uh ,_ kind _of_ _an_ environment . 
B|5| M: _Right ._ _Right ._ 
A|6| B: It's _a_ _two_ story colonial , which my wife _and_ _I_ designed . 
B|7| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|8| B: _Uh _,_ it has_ around thirty-two _hundred square feet_ . _Uh ,_ five _bedrooms and_ so forth _and_ so _on_ , 
B|9| M: _Oh_ . 
A|10| B: _and _it is_ _,_ I_ _would_ imagine in terms _of_ , _of_ size _and_ so forth _, it's_ relatively typical _for_ _the_ _area ._ _It_ might _be_ _, I_ _would_ say _it's_ probably midsized _for_ _the_ _area ._ There are some smaller _, and_ _there_ are _, you_ _know ,_ several larger . 
B|11| M: Um . 
A|12| B: _And , uh _,_ but_ based _, you_ _know ,_ in terms _of_ _, you_ _know ,_ in , in Pensacola , in _that_ _area_ _of_ Florida _it _, uh_ , it's_ _what_ now _, it is _,_ uh ,_ probably ten years _old_ . 
B|13| M: _Oh ,_ wow . 
A|14| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|15| M: _it's _, it_ [,_ it _has] been_ [there] _for a_ long time . 
A|16| B: _And_ so [it's ,] in terms _of_ _cost_ _and , _and_ , and_ size _and_ so forth _, it _, uh_ ,_ _the_ _you_ _know ,_ housing [there] _is_ extremely affordable _, _and_ _, uh_ ,_ _compared to_ other parts _of the_ country _, you_ _know ,_ let's say _compared to_ Maryland _that_ _same_ _house_ _here_ _would_ probably _cost_ three-quarters _of_ [a] million dollars 
B|17| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|18| B: _but ,_ 
B|19| M: [and , and] _that's _,_ that's_ [the] way [I] feel _about _it_ _._ _I mean _,_ _I ,_ I_ think_ [it's _a] good_ thing [, _I] mean_ [it's] _good_ [that] they're trying [, but] [it's] _just_ [like _,] I don't know _,_ I guess_ [, you] _can't_ _make_ [it [,] you] _have_ [to] _make_ _it ._ 
A|20| B: [I] _really_ haven't [, I] _really_ haven't _, uh ,_ when _we_ built [it] ten years ago _, it _was_ [,_ it] ran around _a hundred_ [and] forty thousand dollars . 
B|21| M: _Oh_ . 
A|22| B: _So [,_ I , I] _would have_ _really_ [, I] haven't _really_ priced [, you] [know ,] in [the] market , so [I ,] 
B|23| M:  !!! % !! Remind me . 
A|24| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| M: [and , [and] it] [would have] _been a lot_ bigger .

B|27| M: [and] _the cost of living_ _here _is_ just_ astronomical [compared to] _where I_ am 
A|28| B: [I] thought [that] _was_ _on the_ upswing again now . 
B|29| M: [Uh _,] yeah_ [, _I] mean _,_ it is ._ 
A|30| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| M: _uh [, _I_ , I] think_ [we] [have] gone backwards . 
A|32| B: [Yes .] 
B|33| M: [and] there's , there's _a lot of_ companies [that] [have] _, that_ [have] _done_ _a lot_ better . 
A|34| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|35| M: Um . 
A|36| B: _Well ,_ Pensacola [has] [it's] _really is_ [a] buyer's market [there] now 
B|37| M: [Uh _,] yeah ._ 
A|38| B: _And_ [it] isn't because _of the_ , _well_ , [there] [has [been] [a lot] of] speculative building . [Uh [,] I don't know ,] perhaps _not_ in Dallas , 
B|39| M: Uh-uh . 
A|40| B: _but , uh ,_ I'm sure people in _, uh [,_ you] [know ,] in _, uh ,_ Galveston [and] so forth _would be_ knowledgeable [about _it] _, uh_ ,_ Pensacola [is] [a] Navy town . 
B|41| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| B: _And_ _home_ porting _was_ [a] possibility [a] few years ago . 
B|43| M: _Right ._ 
A|44| B: They _were_ expecting _an_ influx [of] something _on the_ order [of] fifty thousand people or _more_ _from the_ Navy , 
B|45| M: [Uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|46| B: [a] new carrier _was_ coming in _and _, uh_ ,_ [the] _, uh ,_ attendant _, uh ,_ support vessels . _Well , that's_ no longer , [the] case . 
B|47| M: _Right ._ 
A|48| B: [Oh _,] it's [, it_ is [.] I mean ,] [the] , [the] number [of] single family units _on_ sale [is] phenomenal [compared to] [the] population . 
B|49| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| B: _And_ so overbuilding _is ,_ [has [been] a] real problem [there] . 
B|51| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| B: _So_ [you] can _still_ get _a ,_ get _a , a good_ _house_ [for a] _very , very_ reasonable price . _And_ [I mean] [good] [, I] [would] , let's say typical , say three bedroom _, uh ,_ _two_ [and] [a] half baths _, on_ [a] half acre or so [of] land [uh ,] reasonable construction [would] probably run [you] _, uh ,_ right now anywhere between , somewhere between _a hundred_ [and] _a hundred_ [and] forty thousand dollars . _And_ probably , perhaps , cheaper , depending upon [the] neighborhood . 
B|53| M: [Yeah .] 
A|54| B: What [about] your _home_ ? 
B|55| M: [Well [,] it's [, it] , uh] 
A|56| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| M: _it's _, it's_ , uh_ [it's] [an] older [home] [and] _it's _not_ [,_ it [,] it] used [to] [be] _a little_ [more] _expensive [,_ but] _we ,_ we're [still] [, we] [still] [have] [about] [a [hundred] square feet] [and it is] [still] pretty _much_ [an] [old] [house] . 
A|58| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| M: [and] _it's [, uh ,_ it's] got [, uh] [uh [,] uh] [a] den [, [on] the] side [and , uh] [it's] completely brick [, and] [it's] [the] _only_ thing [that] [we] [don't] [like] [about [it] is] [the] privacy [of the] den . 
A|60| B: Nor _do_ [we [,] _but] ,_ 
B|61| M: [but , uh _,] we ,_ we've got [two] [bedrooms [and] , uh] . 
A|62| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| M: [So [,] uh] . 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M:  !!! % !! Remind me [of] _that house_ . 
A|66| B: [Right .] 
B|67| M: [and , and] _they_ [were] all _the same_ , 
A|68| B: [Well ,] [the] housing [here] in Maryland [is just] atrocious . _And_ in , in [the] entire D C _area ._ I'm , I'm [only] [about] [, uh ,] twelve miles or so _from the_ [, uh ,] border [of] Washington D C [, and] Montgomery County , Maryland [is] probably one [of the] most [expensive ,] places _to ,_ 
B|69| M: Uh-uh . [Right .] 
A|70| B: No [, we] are west . 
B|71| M:  !!!!,!! etwork !! % !! eting !! ety !! Okay [, you] sound [like] you're [from the] East . 
A|72| B: Sevren [is] east , near [the] eastern shore , 
B|73| M: Okay _, yeah ._ 
A|74| B: if _I had_ , 
B|75| M: If [I had] [a] boat _, what_ [would] [I] [do] _with_ [it] ? 
A|76| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: [And [, uh [,] it's] _, it] was [very_ , very] [expensive] . 
A|78| B: [Oh _,] that's not_ unusual [, yeah .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's [, it's_ a] nice [area .] 
A|80| B: _Well , [that's_ [,] that] [area] over [there] [is] [not] as [expensive] as in [the] , [the] immediate [, you] [know ,] Washington [area .] 
B|81| M: Uh-uh . [Right .] 
A|82| B: [And] so [, we [,] [uh ,] I] [was] [just] looking , [for] example [there] [is] _a [,_ uh ,] condominium complex next [to] [the] apartment complex [where I] live [, and] [I] [was] over [there] recently looking at [the] possibility [of] buying [a] [two] bedroom condominium . [And] ninety-two thousand dollars [for a] [two] bedroom , which [is] essentially [a] [two] bedroom apartment . 
B|83| M: [Oh [,] yeah] [, that] [is] pretty [expensive] . 
A|84| B: Now [, it was very] nicely [done] . 
B|85| M: [Well [,] it sounds like] you're , you're [very , very] [well] versed [on the] subject . 
A|86| B: [I] [would have] thought , 
B|87| M: [It] [was [,] it's] beautiful . 
A|88| B: [Yes [.] [I] , I] [can't] [, I] [can't] envision spending [that] [much] _money_ [, and] [on] [, on] something along those lines . 
B|89| M: [Well , that's] true . 
A|90| B: [So [,] you] [know [,] it's [,] I guess] [you] pay [the] piper [but ,] Plus [the] , [the] , [the] taxes around [here] are phenomenally , high . 
B|91| M: _Yeah [,_ yeah .] 
A|92| B: [Uh ,] [for] [the] [, and] so [, you] [, on] [that] [it's not] unusual , [for] example , [for] somewhere around [here] [on] _a [,_ on] _a [,_ on] _a [,_ what] [we] [would] [, you] [know [,] what] [you] described as your [house] [and] [what] [I] [would] describe as my [house] say , [for] example , in Pensacola , Florida [, on] [that house] [with] [the] homestead exemption [and] so forth [and] so [on] , might pay three or four [hundred] dollars [a] year taxes . maybe [, you] [know ,] maybe [a little] bit higher than [that] now , 
B|93| M: [Right] [, yeah] [, that's] true . 
A|94| B: [but] [that] [same] [house] [here] , you'd pay almost six thousand dollars [a] year , taxes [on] [it .] 
B|95| M: Wow [, that's not] bad . 
A|96| B: [So [,] [it's , uh] ,] so , [the] question [of] whether [to] buy [here] or move [to] another county , say , drive twenty [more] miles north , buy [a] condominium [for] approximately [, uh ,] [the same] price , maybe [a little] lower [, but] [the] taxes _would be_ [, you] [know ,] perhaps , maybe one-third [uh ,] [of] , 
B|97| M: _Yeah [,_ that] [would be] [a , a good] way [to [,] uh] 
A|98| B: [Oh ,] absolutely . [Yeah ,] 
B|99| M: [Oh] . 
A|100| B: so [, [it's ,] it's] _really_ sad 
B|101| M: [Yeah [,] it is [,] it] [really [is] .] 
A|102| B: This [is] one , this [is] one [of the] most highly taxed areas in [the] country . 
B|103| M: [Yeah [,] I , I] [know] . 
A|104| B: [Well ,] [they] [it ,] [the] , their , [they] [do] [have] [an] extremely [good] , such things as extremely [good] school systems , [for] example . [It] [has] one [of the] best school systems in [the] country . 
B|105| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|106| B: [Uh [,] and] because [the cost of living] around [here is] so high , 
B|107| M:  !!! Remind me . 
A|108| B: public employees [make] great salaries around [here] 
B|109| M: [Oh [,] I , I] agree . 
A|110| B: [I] [was] reading [just] recently [where] [the] typical administrator in [the] , Montgomery County Public Schools makes [, and] I'm [not ,] this [is [,] uh ,] [the] figure , he makes eighty thousand dollars [a] year . 
B|111| M: [Oh ,] okay . 
A|112| B: That's , 
B|113| M: That doesn't sound [like] [a lot of] [money] . 
A|114| B: [and] [I ,] by administrator [I , I think] [I mean , I ,] [they] didn't , [they] did [not] define [it [,] but] [for] example [, a] curriculum supervisor or principal or someone [, you] [know ,] in [that] [, uh ,] in [that] range .
