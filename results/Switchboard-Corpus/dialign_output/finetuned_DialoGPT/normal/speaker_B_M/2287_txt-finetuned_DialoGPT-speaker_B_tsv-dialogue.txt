B|35| M: _Well [,_ you] can't [say] [that] [because] [he's] [not] going [to] [be] around _any_ _more ._ 
A|36| B: [And _, uh] [, _I_ think] that's_ sort [of] _what_ happened with Louisiana [because] [, because] _, um _,_ the_ guy did [get] elected , correct ? 
B|37| M: [Yeah [,] yeah [, and] , uh] . 
A|38| B: That's _what_ [I] thought .

A|40| B: [And _, uh] ,_ [, but] [you know , they] can always fool us [, you know] . He _might_ [do] _a_ good job . 
B|41| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| B: Oh [, yeah] . 
B|43| M: [and] [you] [have] no idea what's going _on_ . 
A|44| B: What [we] [do ,] usually , _is _, uh_ ,_ [vote] _, uh ,_ absenteeism 
B|45| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| B: _and _, uh [,_ I_ [know] ,] here [, you know [,] _you] don't have to_ [have] [any] reason [, you] can [just] go [and] [vote] 
B|47| M: [Right .] 
A|48| B: [and] _the_ polls are open , [what] was _it ,_ _a_ couple [of] weeks _, the_ hours are good [and] [they're] even open [on] Saturdays [and] _a_ couple [of] Sundays . 
B|49| M: Uh . 
A|50| B: [And] [so] we've got plenty [of] time [to] go [, because] down here _in_ Houston _, _it's_ _,_ uh _,_ the_ lines are long . 
B|51| M: [Yeah] . 
A|52| B: So _, uh [,_ but _, uh] ,_ 
B|53| M: [I know] _in [,_ _in] [,_ I know] [in] [the] Dallas area [, [it] [,] [it] seems] [like] [, uh] [the , uh] 
A|54| B: [Well _,] uh , I_ recommend [it [,] because] [you] [just] walk [right] [on] [in [,] and] there's usually [not] anybody [in] line 
B|55| M: [Yeah] . 
A|56| B: _and , uh [,_ you [know ,] that] vote's [just] as good as [, you know _,] _the_ one_ [on] election day . 
B|57| M: [Right ,] _right ._ 
A|58| B: [Uh-huh] [, yeah] . 
B|59| M: [you don't have to] wait until [the next] turn . 
A|60| B: Um [, yeah [,] I've] [been] involved with _, uh ,_ [some] [of] [the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of] [the ,] [of] [the] Republican _party_ [. And] _it's really_ interesting _to see_ [the] process as far as [what] goes through as far as [the] voting [and] _the , uh ,_ how _the , uh _,_ the_ [not] [the] ballots [, but _, uh] ,_ my mind [has] gone blank . [I've] [been] [all] evening How [they] develop _, uh ,_ [what] [the] candidate stands [for] 
B|61| M: Uh , 
A|62| B: [you know _,] the_ views _, and , uh [,_ you know ,] everybody gets [to vote] [on] [, you know ,] well , should [he] [be] [for] [this] [and] [on] [and] [on] [and] [on] _, and , uh _,_ _it's_ , it's_ interesting . 
B|63| M: Uh , uh-hau [, yeah] [that's] [, uh] . 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: [and , uh] 
A|66| B: [Right .] There [for] _a_ while [, that] [would] [, that] worked . We've _, uh [, I_ know] [I] [have] _, um ,_ I'll stick [to] _uh ,_ [to] [the [,] you know ,] sometimes I'll stick [to] _a_ certain _party_ , depends [on] [the] guy . 
B|67| M: Uh [, I] guess I'd [have to] [say] [the one] thing [I [, I] like] [to see] [is , uh] [is] [the , uh ,] [party] [system] [in [,] in] Texas _where_ [the , [the] ,] [party] [system] [is] [so] easy [to get] rid [of] . 
A|68| B: But [, uh ,] if [it [,] uh ,] gets down between two , [then] I'll , I'll [vote for] [the] [party] [because] [I [know] [,] you know ,] [something about] [the] other guy 
B|69| M: [Right ,] _right ._ 
A|70| B: or [, you know [,] they're] [both] [just] as [bad] [, and] I'll [say ,] [Well [, I] know what] [this] guy stands [for] as far as [for] his [party] [, and _,] um [,_ but] [yeah] . [You know _,] that's_ [not] [the] best way [but ,] 
B|71| M: _No _,_ [I don't_ know _, I] mean [,_ I , I] [do [,] I] [just] [think] [it's , [it's] really] [a] dumb [, I] guess [, uh] 
A|72| B: But [it] gets [to] [the] point [where] [, I mean ,] you've got [to] [have] [the] find [the] time also [to] read [about] [the] guy [and [,] and] [be] able [to] find [the] information [about] [what] [he] stands [for] . 
B|73| M: [Yeah , I think [,] uh-huh] . 
A|74| B: [Right ,] or [what] you've heard _on T V ,_ which [I think] [is] [just] outrageous . 
B|75| M: [Yeah] . 
A|76| B: [I [, I] don't] [agree] with how _the media_ handles elections . 
B|77| M: [Well [, I] [, I] think] [it's] [the media] [, but [I] _think] [that_ [, uh ,] I] [would] [like] [to see] them [, uh] . 
A|78| B: [I [,] you know _,] I'm_ tired [of] hearing [about] [the] polls [, you know [,] you know ,] [this] [is] how [he] stands such [and] such [a] day [the] way [they] break [it] _out_ , 
B|79| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
B|81| M: [Well [, I] _think] [that_ [, uh [,] I] [, I] know] [that [,] um [,] I've] seen [a lot of] these [things] [on T V [,] and I think] [they , they] tend [to] sensationalize [things] [that] shouldn't [be] sensationalized . 
A|82| B: [Uh-huh] [, it] [really] could _, and , uh ,_ _then ,_ how , sometimes , how [the media] will blow [things] _out of_ proportion [and] will run an issue into [the] ground which [is] good [and] dead [, and] [they] keep dragging [it] [on] [, and] [it] could hamper [the] outcome [of] an election [for] [the] guy [that] should [have] won . 
B|83| M: [Right .] 
A|84| B: [Yeah ,] [so [,] uh ,] 
B|85| M: [I mean [,] I'm] [not] saying [that] [it's] [not] going [to] [be] popular [, but] [it's] certainly [not] going [be] popular either . 
A|86| B: They [really] [do] . [I , I] sometimes [think that] [that] should [be] limited [more .] 
B|87| M: Uh-uh . 
A|88| B: Oh , yes , or [they [,] I] [agree] with [the] freedom [of] [the] press [, you know [,] and] [all] [the] amendments [, but] sometimes [it's] [for] [the] public's own good [that [we] don't] hear [things] . 
B|89| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|90| B: [No [,] they] [don't] . 
B|91| M: [I think that's] [, that's] [a] shame [, because] [they] [really] ought [to] [do] [something about] , you're [right] [, they] ought [to] [put] these [people] [in] jail [, and] [then , you] [, you] can't expect them [to] , you'll [, you] won't [get] them [out of] jail [, you] [might] [get] somebody , 
A|92| B: [Well , I] enjoyed talking [to] [you] . 
B|93| M: [You] too [, and , uh ,] thank [you] [for] calling . 
A|94| B: All [right .] 
B|95| M: _Bye-bye ._
