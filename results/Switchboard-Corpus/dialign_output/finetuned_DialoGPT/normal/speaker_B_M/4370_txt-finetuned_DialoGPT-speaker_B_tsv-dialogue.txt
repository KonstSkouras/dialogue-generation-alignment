B|17| M: _Yeah_ _, _that_ _,_ that_ [is] [a] good point .

B|23| M: _Yeah_ [, that's] true . 
A|24| B: [Uh [,] [and] _I] think_ [that would] provide [a] more fair sentencing procedure . [As] opposed [to] an emotional sentencing procedure . Also , may [be] [a] more consistent sentencing procedure . 
B|25| M: _Yeah [._ [I] think] so _too_ [. I] [, I] [, uh] 
A|26| B: _Well ,_ preceding criminal record , according [to] _the_ judicial process has nothing [to] do [with] _the_ current _crime_ .

B|27| M: [Right] . 
A|28| B: At least [in] California , they're supposed [to] [be] . [Not] during _the_ trial , during _the_ trial as [to] whether they're [guilty] [or] [not] has nothing [to] do [with] their background . 
B|29| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|30| B: [But] when [it] comes [to] what kind [of] [sentence] [you're] going [to] lay down _, I think_ [that , uh] [, [that] they] should . 
B|31| M: Uh-huh . 
A|32| B: [I don't] _, I don't know_ [that they] always [have] [because] [I] [never] sat [all] _the_ way through [a jury] trial . [They] [get] [too] boring .

B|39| M: _Yeah ._
