B|19| M: _Yeah , it_ _is_ . 
A|20| B: If [you] _don't_ [have a] frost you'll [be] all _right_ That's [what] [I] remember _from_ living up [north] _, is that_ you'd [get] everything set [and then] you'd [have a] frost [and] half [the] stuff _would_ [get] frostbitten [, and] you'd [have to] . 
B|21| M: [Oh _,] my_ .

B|23| M: [and then] [it] _got_ [to be] cold [and] rainy [and] finally [it] _was_ broken . 
A|24| B: [Oh ,] boy , that's frustrating . 
B|25| M: [So _,] _I_ don't [know_ _,] _I_ just _, I_ , I_ [really] [don't] _like to_ spend _too much_ _time_ _on the_ phone , _you're_ [right] . 
A|26| B: [Oh [,] yeah [,] my] husband does [that ,] thank goodness , because [I ,] that's [not] [a] pleasure _for_ me 
B|27| M: [Oh] . 
A|28| B: [I] love gardens [that] _are_ _well_ tended _, and [I_ just ,] there's [been] [a] few different places _I've lived_ where _I've_ [just] [I don't know] whether [it's] little old ladies living there or [what] [, but] [you] could [just] tell [that] _they_ had [a] love [, uh [,] a] love affair [with] their gardens , [with] beautiful wild flowers [, and] [just , I] love [the] host [of] [colors] [that] [just] keep coming all [, you] [know ,] year long . And [, uh [,] I , I was] [in] England once [, and] that's one thing [that] impressed me so [much] [is] _no_ matter [what] size yard somebody had _, they_ had [a] beautiful [garden] [in] [it] . You [know [,] it] could [be] three feet by four feet or something . 
B|29| M: [Yeah _,] [that_ _,] that_ [is] _, that_ _would be_ [a] big influence . 
A|30| B: [So] [I] [do] admire [that [,] but] [I] haven't [really] put [, uh [,] [too] much] energy into [it] . Course [we have] two little kids [that] _are_ two [and] three _years_ old 
B|31| M: Uh , 
A|32| B: [So] [that] has put [a] crimp [in] [my] every activity [other] than diapers [and] laundry , I'll tell [you] 
B|33| M: [Oh] [yeah [,] they] [do] . 
A|34| B: [yeah ,] that's [really] lovely [. I] [would] love [to] [have] different fruit trees . It's [, it's] [been wonderful] [to] [have] [the] peaches . They're [just] delicious . And [, we] [, we] [we have] , still [have to] spray some [, but] [we] [don't] [have to] [just] asphyxiate ourself [with] [the] poison , which [is] _good_ , because [I just , I] can't [see the] point [in] doing [that] [and] eating anything [out] [of] [it] afterwards . 
B|35| M: [Yeah .] 
A|36| B: Um , we've tried them [, but] again [, [it's] just] [like] [the] sun scorch . 
B|37| M: [Oh ,] [no] . 
A|38| B: We've tried them [in] kind [of] halfway [in the] shade [and] halfway [in the] [I] mean [it's [just] [,] you] [really] , [really] [have [to] be] prepared [to] water constantly during [the] Summer . 
B|39| M: [Yeah .] 
A|40| B: People [that] [have] [been] successful [out] here [have] done this drip irrigation [and] installed [that ,] 
B|41| M: [Yeah .] 
A|42| B: [and] um , that's [really] [what] _makes_ [the] most _sense_ , because [you] [don't] [have to] use so [much] water [, and] 
B|43| M: [Yeah _,] that_ [makes] [sense] . 
A|44| B: [it] [really] does [the] [job .] [But] [it's just] amazing how hot [and] dry [and] _for_ how long [it] gets [out] here . And if [you're] [not] [really] committed [to] [it [,] I] mean , me [, I'm] [, you] [know [,] I'm] real committed [to] [it] _for_ about [a] week [, and then] [I] forget about [it] _for_ [a] week [, and then] [I] [go] , [Oh [,] yeah [,] I] need [to] [do] something [, and] by [then] [it's] burned up [, you] [know] . 
B|45| M: [Yeah .] 
A|46| B: It's [just] [too] distracting [right] _now_ [with] these little ones [in] our lives , so maybe [when] [I] [get] older I'll [find] [, uh ,] some joy [in] [that] 
B|47| M: Uh _, well _,_ I think_ [that [,] uh] . 
A|48| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah , [it] just] gets so hot so fast here . We [don't] [have] [really] [a] [Spring] or [a] Fall 
B|49| M:  !!! % !! Weather !! _weather_ !! Weather !! forecast !! wind !! 
A|50| B: [and] [it [just] [,] uh ,] immediately heats up . [So ,] that's one thing [I] miss about living up [north] , as [I] remember , um [, you] [know [,] the] long Springs [and] long Falls [and the] cooler [weather] . [It was] [really] [nice] . 
B|51| M: Uh _, well [,_ I'm] originally [from] [the] [, uh] New York area [and [I] ,] [I've lived] _in , uh [,_ the] northern _part of_ [the] state [for] [, uh] twenty [years] . 
A|52| B: We always had gardens [when] [I [was] , uh ,] living [in] Chicago . In fact [, my] mother once tore up our entire back yard [and] redid [it] . I'll never forget . Got [my] stepfather [to] put [in , uh [,] a] waterfall [and] [a] little pond [in] one corner [. I] mean [, that] [was] [like] [the] most energy invested [in] anything [in the] whole [time] [I] ever knew him They remodeled [the] entire back yard . Then [they] sold [the] house [and] [got] divorced , so [I don't know] [what] [that] says about [it] all 
B|53| M: [Yeah .] 
A|54| B: [Oh [,] but] she used [to] love [to] [do] stuff [like] [that] . 
B|55| M: Well , [now [,] is that] [the] _part_ [that] [you're] saying [that [,] [that] [,] uh] ... 
A|56| B: [Yeah , it] [really] [was] [. I] enjoyed [it] there . [But] maybe [when] [the] boys [get] [a] little older , we'll [do] some [more] planting , because [they] [like to] [see] things grow . They've done [a] couple [of] little seed projects [, and] so [I think] [it] [would be] fun [for] them . 
B|57| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| B: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
B|59| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| B: [Oh ,] yes They're both running around [now] . 
B|61| M: Yes [, they] [are] . 
A|62| B: [Yeah [,] well [,] it's] very therapeutic [, I think ,] [really] [to get] [out] there [and] dig [in the] dirt [, you] [know] . 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: They certainly enjoy [that] [part of] [it] It's [just] trying [to] keep anything [. I] planted bulbs last [, uh ,] Fall [on the] side guard [, and] [when] [I] [went] [out] there [in the] [Spring] [and the] first day [they] came [out] [the] little one [went] [and] pulled all [the] flowers off [, [and] the] flower petals were scattered all over [the] walk 
B|65| M: [Oh] . 
A|66| B: He thought , [what] [are] these fun toys [that] mommy put [out] here [with] all these [colors] [for] me [to] play [with] ? At least he didn't eat them [, I] mean [, I] guess [I] could [be] thankful [for] [that] . 
B|67| M: [Yeah .] 
A|68| B: [Yeah ,] [really] . If [they] survive this year . [Oh [,] well ,] _good_ luck _to you_ . 
B|69| M: Well [, it's] [good] _talking to you_ [, and I] hope [you [have] a] [good] evening .
