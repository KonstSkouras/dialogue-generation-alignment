A|50| B: Surely , _there's_ [and] end [to [,] the] situation . 
B|51| M: It _seems_ [that [,] _that] there's _a_ lot of_ anger [, because] people say [, you] , you're welcome [to] go . 
A|52| B: [Right .] 
B|53| M: [and [,] [and] , uh] [and _I] think_ [that's] , [that's] [the] way [that] [the] justice system works [and [I] _, I] think_ [it's] going [to be] addressed _in the_ courts , _but it's_ [not] going [to] change over [the] next ten [or] fifteen _years_ [, you] , you're going [to [have] to] change [that] aspect [of] [it .] 
A|54| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: [and I] don tinker [with that] [at] _all ._ 
A|56| B: [Right .] 
B|57| M: [but , uh] . 
A|58| B: Rome , [New York] [, it's] [up] [state] [it] [it's [,] uh ,] near Syracuse 
B|59| M:  !!!!,!! iful !! My little boy [just] _got_ [in] kindergarten [, [and] I] [was] [just] thinking [, you know ,] [that's] great [, that] [they're] starting kindergarten next [year] . 
A|60| B: [it's] _about_ [, uh [,] well [,] I , I] actually live [in a] Village [of] Sylvan Beach [, I] work [in] Rome [, uh ,] 
B|61| M: _Oh , yeah ,_ uh-huh . 
A|62| B: It's more rural , 
B|63| M: [I'm] [in] , [I'm] [in] Plano [, _so] ._ 
A|64| B: [uh [,] it] use [to be] use _to be [a_ , uh [,] uh ,] _have [a_ lot of] heavy industry , 
B|65| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|66| B: [but it's] kind [of] [, uh ,] [all] [the] industry has gone south , 
B|67| M: [Right .] 
A|68| B: [and [, uh] ,] now [the] Air Force [is] [the] largest employer _in the [,_ uh ,] area [and [, uh] [,] uh [,] so] [it's ,] Not too bad , 
B|69| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|70| B: _it [,_ you _know ,] you_ still [have] [the [,] uh ,] more drug problems [and] typical [, uh ,] small city type problems , 
B|71| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|72| B: _but I_ [don't know] [that there's a] real [, uh ,] 
B|73| M: _Yeah ._ 
A|74| B: no _there_ isn't [the] harsh crime [and] [all .] 
B|75| M: [Oh [,] I] [agree] . Uh , 
A|76| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| M: _they_ , _they_ go out [and kill] [the] person [, you] can't do [that ,] 
A|78| B: [Right .] 
B|79| M: [and] _it's like [,_ you] [just] [don't] [, you] [don't] see [, you] can't see what [they're] doing . 
A|80| B: _I think , I think_ Pennsylvania may [have] [just] reenacted [it] [because] [I'm] from [, uh ,] from Pennsylvania [also] , [just] [, uh ,] [just] outside , [of] Philadelphia , 
B|81| M: Uh-uh . [Oh ,] uh-h . 
A|82| B: [Yeah .] 
B|83| M: [but [,] I] mean , I've been [there] _like [,_ I] [was] [in] , _like [,_ the] second grade [, [and] then] [I] _went_ [to] college , 
A|84| B: [Right .] 
B|85| M: [and , uh] . 
A|86| B: The west part [of the] [state] [is] [and then] [the] east part [of the] [state] has [got] [all] [the] bleeding hearts [and] [all] [the] welfare cases [so .] 
B|87| M: [Oh ,] [that's] [, that] [is] [a _,] that would [be_ a] [really] scary [thought] . 
A|88| B: [Right .] 
B|89| M: [I , _I] guess_ [I [have] [a] hard] time [with _that] ._ 
A|90| B: [Right .] 
B|91| M: [and] [it's] [not] [that] [we [have] [to] be a] little bit Romanesque [about] [it ,] 
A|92| B: Sure . 
B|93| M: [if] _they_ _had_ [a] chance [to] do something , _they_ [would] say [that] _they_ were [very] , [very] creative [and ,] 
A|94| B: [Yeah ,] 
B|95| M: [but it's] [not] [like] [it's] going [to] _happen to_ everybody . 
A|96| B: [if] your friends [or] family [got] [, uh ,] [had] [that] [happen to] them [I think] everyone [would] [, I ,] they'd , probably pull [the] trigger themselves [or] flip [the] switch themselves [and] [with] [a] smile on their face , as [they] did [it .] 
B|97| M: [Uh-huh .] Uh-hue . [Yeah .] [Yeah _, yeah [,] [I_ think] , I think] _that would [be_ the] best _thing to_ do . 
A|98| B: [Yeah [.] Right .] 
B|99| M: [and , uh] [that] [was] [a] big factor [in] my decision . 
A|100| B: [Right . Right .] 
B|101| M: [but] [you] [would] want [to] [know , you] wouldn tinker [with] [it .] [I] mean [, I think] [that's] [the] whole point [of the] trial [by] jury . 
A|102| B: Well [, uh [,] [I [,] uh] [,] yeah , I] [don't know] [I think] [the] old gas chamber [seems] [to be] [about] [the] most painless [because] [I guess] [it's a] pretty , pretty rough [thing [to] be] [, uh ,] electrocuted . 
B|103| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| B: [Oh , yeah ,] an injection , 
B|105| M: [Yeah .] 
A|106| B: [yeah [,] that would be] even [, yeah , I] didn't even , [think] [about] [that .] 
B|107| M: [Yeah .] 
A|108| B: [I think ,] 
B|109| M: [but [I] think , I think] [in the [,] in] [, in] Texas [they] _have [it_ .] 
A|110| B: [yeah ,] [there's] more [that] [don't] [have it] [but] amazingly [it's like [,] uh ,] Massachusetts [went] back [, and] reinstated capital punishment , oh , maybe six [or] seven [years] ago , 
B|111| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|112| B: [I] [don't know] [if] [they've] used [it] since [then] since [they've] reinstated [it] [but [, uh] [,] it's] on [the] books . 
B|113| M: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|114| B: [Right .]
