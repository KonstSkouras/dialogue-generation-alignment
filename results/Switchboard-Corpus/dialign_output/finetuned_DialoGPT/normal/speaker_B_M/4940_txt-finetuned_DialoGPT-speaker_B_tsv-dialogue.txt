B|15| M: [Oh] . 
A|16| B: The worst [one] [for] smog [is] Mexico City . 
B|17| M: [Oh , really] ? [Oh [,] yeah _,] well_ [, I] guess [, I] [don't] [know] [. I] guess _you_ [just] _have to_ look _at_ _it_ from [the] south , _because_ we're [so] heavily _polluted_ down [there] _that [,_ uh] 
A|18| B: The most [polluted] city [in the] world 
B|19| M: [Yeah .] 
A|20| B:  . [Yeah [.] I] [know] [that] they've , they're looking [at] _, uh _,_ uh ,_ [you] [know] _, uh ,_ [you] [know] , better running automobiles . 
B|21| M: [Yeah .] 
A|22| B: _Uh ,_ [some] things they do , [one of] them [is] they're using corn [in] fuel . 
B|23| M: [Oh , really] ? 
A|24| B: You ever heard [of] [that] ? 
B|25| M:  !!! % !! Remind me . 
A|26| B: [Yeah .] Methanol ?

A|28| B: [Yeah .] [Well] [that's] big up here [because] [of the] , they grow a lot [of] corn 
B|29| M:  !!! % 
A|30| B: _Uh ,_ [that's one] _thing that_ they do . At [that ,] it's pretty easy [to] do . 
B|31| M: [Yeah] _, it_ [is] . 
A|32| B: And [the] _, uh ,_ unfortunately [, it] still contributes [to] global warming cause , [you] [have to] , [you] [know] , wipe out forests [to] grow corn [and] things like [that] . 
B|33| M: [Yeah .] 
A|34| B: It doesn't make sense . _Uh ,_ _but_ it's , [you] [know] , [one of the] most _, uh ,_ productive crop [in the] world [is] corn . 
B|35| M: [Oh , really] ? 
A|36| B: [Yeah .] 
B|37| M: _But_ [I] think [that's] [the] only [thing that] [you] can't . 
A|38| B: Drive cars [with] catalytic converters [, and] all [that] . It's interesting . They're , they're looking [at] , there's [some] work being done on _, uh ,_ automobiles [that] are electrical powered 
B|39| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|40| B: And _, uh ,_ they're looking [at] where [you] [have] a battery operated car basically , _but_ [it] has a , a engine [in the] back [that] charges [it] . 
B|41| M: [Oh , really] . 
A|42| B: [So] [the] engine kicks on when [the] batteries need power [and] [it] turns off . 
B|43| M: [Right .] 
A|44| B: Interesting [thing] [about] gas [is] when [, I] mean , [about] battery powered cars [is] when you're [at] a stop light , you're [not] using any any energy 
B|45| M: [Uh ,] no . 
A|46| B: Unlike a car where it's running . 
B|47| M: [Right .] 
A|48| B: A electric car it's on demand [. I] mean it's either on [or] off . 
B|49| M: [Oh ,] my . 
A|50| B: Basically . 
B|51| M: [So] , 
A|52| B: You [don't] [have to] shift [So] [you] , cars become very simple all [of] a sudden too . 
B|53| M: [Right .] 
A|54| B: Very interesting . 
B|55| M: [So] , 
A|56| B: [Yeah .] There's , there's a race [in] Australia [with] solar powered cars . 
B|57| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|58| B: And Ford [and] General Motors [and] all those compete . 
B|59| M: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|60| B: [Right .] [Yeah] 
B|61| M: _But [,_ uh ,] 
A|62| B: G M [, uh ,] Chrysler announced [that] they're going [to] , they're [, well] they actually [have] [an] electric minivan . [Yeah .] Their , their Caravan . [But] [it] costs [, uh ,] fifty thousand dollars right now . 
B|63| M: [Yeah .] 
A|64| B: "To operate [, yeah] . [But ,] [you] [know] , people are buying them . You [know] whose buying them ? *""whose"" = who's"" The power company . Free , [you] [know] , free [for] them . " 
B|65| M: [Right .] 
A|66| B: Kind [of] interesting [so] [see .] 
B|67| M: [So] [, uh] . 
A|68| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] It's top speed [is] something like eighty miles [an hour] . [So] it's a good , good vehicle . 
B|69| M: [Oh , really] ? 
A|70| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|71| M: [but] [, uh] . 
A|72| B: [Oh [,] I] wasn't [there] too long ago . [Uh] . 
B|73| M: [Oh] . 
A|74| B: [Well ,] [you] [know] , going over [the] hills , [you] [know] , coming into [the] valley ? 
B|75| M: [Yeah .]
