A|0| B: It's eighty eighty-eight ? 
B|1| M: Uh-huh . 
A|2| B: Okay . _Uh_ what type _of_ _, uh_ , utilizations do _you_ make _of_ _it_ ? Word processing obviously . 
B|3| M: Uh-huh . 
A|4| B: Okay . _Uh _,_ I_ use them both here at work _and_ at home . 
B|5| M: _Right ._ 
A|6| B: _And_ _I_ have _I_ B M clones in both cases . 
B|7| M: Oh , yeah . 
A|8| B: Here at work _I_ have _the_ T _I_ _one_ thousand which is _a_ three eighty-six base machine . 
B|9| M: Oh , _really_ ? 
A|10| B: Yes _, it_ is . _Uh ,_ unfortunately _I_ need all _of_ _it ._ 
B|11| M: Uh-huh . 
A|12| B: _Uh ,_ for example _, I was_ messing around _with a_ spreadsheet this weekend _that's_ _a_ third _of_ _a_ meg in beta size . 
B|13| M: Yeah . 
A|14| B: _And_ that _, _I_ know_ that _, uh_ , brings an eighty eighty-eight machine _to_ its knees because _I_ had taken _it_ over from _a_ friend _who_ _was_ working on _it_ _and_ he had _a_ two eighty-six machine , 
B|15| M: Uh-huh . 
A|16| B: _and_ _it_ brought _it_ _to_ its knees . Just in _the_ ability _to_ handle . 
B|17| M: Oh , yeah . 
A|18| B: _And_ then _I_ have _, uh_ , _a_ three eighty-six F X _a_ sixteen bit machine , at home . 
B|19| M: Uh-huh . 
A|20| B: _And_ I'm [really] pleased _with_ _it ._ 
B|21| M: [I] bet . 
A|22| B: It manages _to_ take care _of_ all my home needs in terms _of_ word processing _and_ spreadsheets _and_ _, uh_ , databases , database searches . 
B|23| M: Oh , yeah . Uh-hue . 
A|24| B: _Uh ,_ what I've gotten into more recently _are_ _the_ tools _to_ use them . Have _you_ , 
B|25| M: [Uh] . 
A|26| B: To try _to_ make them more effective _and_ useful . 
B|27| M: Yeah _, and_ [I know] [a] lot [of] people [who] [are] very , very against [it .] 
A|28| B: Have _you_ been _, uh_ , struggling along those lines ? 
B|29| M: No [, I] haven't . 
A|30| B: Well _, I think_ _you_ will be real pleased _to_ get away from _the_ banana as [I] used _to_ call [it .] It's _, uh_ [, I] used [it] on _, uh_ , some other machines in days gone by [and] _was_ real pleased _to_ leave [it .] It _was_ [a] real memory hog when _you_ started making large blot changes _to_ [it .] 
B|31| M: Uh-huh . 
A|32| B: The , at least _the_ version [I] had tended _to_ keep copies [of] that . Of what _you_ were changing [and] deleting off in memory until all [of] , all [of] [a] sudden _you_ got [a] disc full error . Not [a] fun thing _to_ try _to_ recover from . 
B|33| M: Yeah . 
A|34| B: Very frustrating . _Uh ,_ but again I've been dealing _with_ large files both data [and] [, and] otherwise . _Uh ,_ that _was_ [a] engineering spec on B two . You come here _with_ _the_ B level [of] specs ? 
B|35| M: [Uh ,] yeah . 
A|36| B: Well , _it's just_ [a] huge file that tries _to_ describe _the_ requirements [of] what you're trying _to_ build . [Uh ,] _to_ _one_ level down from assistant description . 
B|37| M: Uh-huh . 
A|38| B: Well [, I] sure need them . [Uh ,] there's no way that [I] could begin _to_ process [and] keep up _with_ _the_ kinds [of] information or _the_ magnitude [of] information that [I] need _to_ , _to_ try _to_ do my job without them . 
B|39| M: Yeah . 
A|40| B: Yes _, uh_ , maybe you'll play around some [and] figure _out_ how they can help _you_ do different things _. _I think_ that's_ when _you_ , _you_ start deciding that _you_ [really] need greater assets than _you_ already have . When _you_ start seeing what all they can do for _you ._ 
B|41| M: Uh-huh . 
A|42| B: Well [, I] understand that _you_ [know] . if , needs [and] wants were _the_ same I'd have [a] four eighty-six machine at home 
B|43| M: Uh-huh . 
A|44| B: [Right .] 
B|45| M: [And] , uh-huh . 
A|46| B: [Uh ,] _that's_ , _came out_ around _the_ first _of the_ year . 
B|47| M: Yeah [, I was] going [to] say [, it] [came out] [with a] lot [of] stuff . 
A|48| B: It does [a] few more things _, uh_ , than had been available before . 
B|49| M: Yeah . 
A|50| B: But I'm not sure that _it's_ such [a] massive improvement . [Uh ,] _you_ _know ,_ once _you_ get passed thirty-three megahertz , all help is , kind [of] lost in _the_ , in _the_ translation . Because _you_ no longer can _think_ that fast anyway . 
B|51| M: Yeah [, I] don't [know [,] [I think] that's] [one] [of the] big problems [with] , [with] American cars [. I think] [, I] [, it] seems like [, uh] [I think] [it's just] too , too expensive . 
A|52| B: Well , okay [. I] enjoyed our discussion . 
B|53| M: Yeah [, it] [was] nice talking [to] [you .] 
A|54| B: You do [the] same .
