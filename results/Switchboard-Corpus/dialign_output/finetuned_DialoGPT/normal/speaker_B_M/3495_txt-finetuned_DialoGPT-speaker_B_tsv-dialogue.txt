B|0| M: But , uh . 
A|1| B: It , _it_ , it's pretty bad here , too . 
B|2| M: Uh-uh . _Well ,_ _we_ _have_ , uh 
A|3| B: We've had _a lot of_ murders drug related _and_ stuff . In Durham , which is right next _to_ Raleigh . 
B|4| M: Uh-huh . 
A|5| B: Yeah , _that ,_ _that_ Durham , Raleigh _, and_ Chapel Hill is _the_ triangle . 
B|6| M: Oh , okay . 
A|7| B: Right . 
B|8| M: _And_ , uh _, I_ think , uh 
A|9| B: Yeah , it's , it's _really_ , it's _, and_ _I've_ seen in _more_ in Durham than [I] [have] in Raleigh or , or or Chapel Hill . 
B|10| M: Uh-huh . 
A|11| B: Chapel Hill is kind _of_ _a_ , _a_ ritzy city or whatever _. _I_ mean ,_ it's kind _of ,_ I'm , I'm sure there is problems with _it_ , but _it_ has _a_ pretty low crime rate . Compare , compared _to_ , _to_ , Durham has probably got _the_ worst . They've had _like_ forty-eight murders since _the_ beginning _of the_ year . 
B|12| M: Uh-huh . 
A|13| B: [And] over half _of it_ has been drug related . 
B|14| M: Oh , [really] ? 
A|15| B: Yeah . 
B|16| M: [I mean _,] [I_ mean] _I ,_ uh . 
A|17| B: Yeah . 
B|18| M: You _know ,_ _people_ , _people_ get older [and] _they_ _, they_ get _out_ [of it] . 
A|19| B: [Well ,] _that _,_ and_ _the_ _, and_ _the_ economy is so bad [and] , [And] so many [people] [have] been laid off [and] stuff . 
B|20| M: Oh _, yeah_ . 
A|21| B: They've _done_ special _stories_ on _the_ news , local news here . 
B|22| M:  !!! % [Well ,] [I've] heard [stories] . 
A|23| B: We had _a lot of_ bank robberies [and] different , _lot of_ break ins [and] stuff _. I_ [know ,] _like_ _a_ week or so ago [, I] live in _a_ , in _a_ town house , which is , _you_ [know ,] it's _a_ pretty nice neighborhood [and] this lady was _going to_ work , she came home [and] everything in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything . [And] nobody thought any different [, they] _just_ thought she was moving . It was _a_ moving man pulled right up _to_ her house , broke in [and] stole everything she owned 
B|24| M: _Uh ,_ 
A|25| B: [Well [,] yeah] , it's , it's , it's pretty bad 
B|26| M: [Well] what else do _we_ [like] [to] [have] ? 
A|27| B: [Uh [,] I] would say so for _the_ majority in , in our , in my little section _of the_ neighborhood because there is always somebody at home 
B|28| M: Uh-huh . 
A|29| B: [and] [we] all [know] _one_ another [and] _, and_ , on our _one_ little section _of the_ street [we] all [know] _one_ another [and] [know] _that_ we're not moving [and] different things [like] _that_ . 
B|30| M: [Uh] . 
A|31| B: It's _, I ,_ I'm , I'm probably _the_ , _one of the_ youngest [people] _that_ live over here . 
B|32| M: Oh _, are_ [you] [really] ? 
A|33| B: Most [people] [are] [, are] , retired or , or , or , [you] [know ,] they're , they're in their forties or , or whatever . _So_ [and] I'm in my twenties , so [I ,] I'm , I'm [out] _more_ than [they] [are] , but they're at home at night , 
B|34| M: Uh-huh . 
A|35| B: so [I] [really] _don't_ worry _about_ anything . 
B|36| M: Uh-huh . 
A|37| B: Yeah . 
B|38| M: [And] [I [,] and] [I] [don't] think [that ,] uh , there's much [that] can be [done] [about] [it] . 
A|39| B: Yeah , see , _that's_ _the_ same thing here . 
B|40| M: [And] [I] think [that's] [going to] be [one of the] major changes [. I] think [, I [,] I] [don't] [know [,] I] do feel [like] , uh . 
A|41| B: Yeah . 
B|42| M: [And] [we] [have] [a lot [of] ,] uh [a lot] [more] single family homes [and] [a lot] fewer single family families . 
A|43| B: Yeah . 
B|44| M: [So] [, I] [don't] [know [,] I] [just] [, I] guess [I] [just] feel [like] there's [a] need [to] be [more] [of] [that] sort [of ,] uh
