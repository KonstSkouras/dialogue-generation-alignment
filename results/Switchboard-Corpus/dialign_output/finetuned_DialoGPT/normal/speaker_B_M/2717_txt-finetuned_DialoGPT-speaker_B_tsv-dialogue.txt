A|0| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|1| M: _and _,_ uh _,_ I_ donno _, I'm not sure_ _if_ _they_ _have_ _it_ _up_ _there _._ I_ don _, I _think_ it's_ _up_ _there_ _where_ _you_ actually _have to_ register _as a_ _capital_ _case_ . 
A|2| B: _Yeah ._ _Uh-huh_ , well from _what_ [I] [I] saw [a] statistic _just_ [a] few _days ago_ , um , so far this year , or _was_ [it] during _the_ last year , during [a] year's time [, _I think] it was_ [they] executed twenty-five _people_ _in_ _the_ nation . Meanwhile , [there] were twenty-five hundred _people_ _on death_ row . _So_ _I _, I_ _,_ _and_ it's_ building [up] _, you know ,_ _they're_ , _they're_ convicting _them_ faster than _they're_ executing _them_ so [it's] _really_ building [up] . 
B|3| M: It's _getting_ _to be_ [a] big problem . 
A|4| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| M: _And_ some _of the people that_ _are_ [in] [there] _now_ _, I don't_ [know ,] _are_ still [on death] Row . 
A|6| B: _Yeah ,_ everybody's got _that ._ 
B|7| M: _I mean [,_ you] can't [, you] _don't_ [know ,] _there's_ _no_ room _for_ _all_ _of_ _them ._ 
A|8| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Yeah ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|9| M: _So _,_ it's not_ [just] [the] _prison_ _people _,_ it_ _is the_ _society_ [in] general . 
A|10| B: _Yeah ._ Isn't , _isn't_ Maryland [where] [the] famous Willy Horton [case] _was ._ 
B|11| M: _Oh_ _, yeah [,_ I] _remember_ [that _.] [I_ think it _was] _,_ [it_ was] _on the_ news [a] little bit , [a] couple _of_ [days ago] . 
A|12| B: _It_ [was [,] uh _,] that_ [was] [the] _one_ [that] [was] used so _much_ [in] [the] campaign . In [the] [in] [the] presidential race . Uh , _may_ [, it] _may_ _not have_ _been_ Maryland _. It_ _may have_ _been_ Massachusetts [, I don't] [remember] . 
B|13| M: [I don't] [know] . _I've_ _only_ [been] [up] _here_ [a] couple _of_ weeks [and] _I can_ barely [remember] _what _the_ [,_ uh _,] the ,_ 
A|14| B: Anyway , well [the] question [is] _, you know ,_ _do_ [you] [think] [, it] does _make_ [a] difference [in] whether or [not] [a] criminal commits [a] crime or _do_ [you] [think _it] can_ [if] [it's] done _right_ ? 
B|15| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|16| B: If _it ,_ 
B|17| M: _But_ [I think] _they're _going to_ be_ _, you [,_ _you] have to_ [think] _about_ [, uh] . 
A|18| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|19| M: You [know [,] _I] mean_ [it's] [just] , 
A|20| B: _Yeah _._ Well_ [I think] [in] large measure [the] reason [they] [don't] care [, it's not] because [the] punishment _, but_ so many [of the people that] commit crimes [don't] _get_ punished . 
B|21| M: Right . 
A|22| B: The police [don't] catch [them] , or [the] courts [don't] convict [them] , or , or [they] [don't] serve _very_ _much [of_ the] time [and] so [, uh _,] you know ,_ their , their success rate [is] _very_ high . Crime does pay [, you] [can] _make_ _a good_ living at _it ._ 
B|23| M: Uh-uh . 
A|24| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|25| M: _So [,_ you] [don't] [know ,] _you're_ [right] , [they] [may have] [just] [been] _caught_ _and [,_ uh] 
A|26| B: Last year [it was] D C [, I] guess Baltimore [caught] [them .] 
B|27| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|29| M: [and it's] _just not_ [, _it] doesn't_ [, it] [isn't] anywhere near _as_ [much of] [a] deterrent _as_ [it] once [was .] 
A|30| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|31| M: [you know ,] [they] _have _to_ get_ [a] , [a] , [get] [a] new [one] 
A|32| B: _Yeah [,_ the] [only] consolation [is] so many [of the] murders [are] _, you know [,_ _the ,] the_ violent [people] [going] against each other [and] so [they] _, you know ,_ society's [not] [going to] put [them] _to death_ , well at least maybe [the] guy [they] cross next time [is] [going to] . Uh [, I think] [, I think] [capital] punishment [is] an appropriate punishment [for] [the] kind [of] [people] [where] we _say_ _, you know ,_ this sort [of] person [is] [just not] acceptable [to] our [society] [and] we [are] [there] _by_ [going to] remove [them] from [society] , [not] temporarily _, but_ permanently . 
B|33| M:  !!! Remind me [of] [that .] 
A|34| B: [I mean _,] _I ,_ I_ personally [think] life imprisonment [, I don't] [think] [much of] [of] life imprisonment . First [of] [all] [, it's] never , turns out [to be] life _, but_ second _, you know ,_ why should we [, the] _idea_ [of] life imprisonment with [no] chance [of] parole _. Well_ [that] means [you're] [going to] put [them] [in] [a] cage [you] [think it's] never _ever_ [going to be] safe [for] [them] [to] walk [the] streets again , well then , why bother . Just execute [them] , because _that's_ _, that_ way [you're] [sure] they'll never _ever_ [going to] walk [the] streets again . 
B|35| M: [Well] , [that's] _true_ [, I] [know [,] _I] have_ [a] friend who's [a] , [a] [, uh ,] [a] _prison_ fanatic _and [,_ uh] she's sentenced [to death] [for] , [for] _like_ [, uh] theft [of] property . 
A|36| B: [So] any , any , anybody [that] says life [in] [prison] with [no] chance [of] parole , I'd _say_ [, uh ,] give [them] [the] [death] penalty [So ,] 
B|37| M: [Yeah _,] yeah_ . 
A|38| B: [Yeah _,] [and_ _,] and_ also , um [, _the ,] the_ _thing_ [I don't] [like] [about] [a] lot [of] these court trials [and] [a] lot [of] these appeals [is] _that it's not_ based [on] [what] [is] [true] [and] [what] [is] false _but_ rather [it's] [on the] rules [of] evidence , [what] [can] [I] hide [and] [what] _do_ [I [have] to] tell . 
B|39| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| B: [And] [I think] our courts should [be] geared [much] more strongly towards finding out [the] truth than [they] currently [are] . 
B|41| M: [Well] , [that's] [true] , too . 
A|42| B: [And] _, and that_ way we _can be_ [sure] _, you know ,_ we [can] find out [the] truth , we [can] find out [what] _really_ happened [and _,] and_ base [the] sentence [on] [what the] person _did_ , [not] [on] [what] we're allowed [to] let [the] jury hear 
B|43| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|45| M: [and] he [was] trying _to decide_ between [, uh] 
A|46| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| M: _But_ he [was] killed [by] [a] stray bullet . 
A|48| B: Just started shooting [people ,] because [they] botched [the] first job 
B|49| M: Right . 
A|50| B: [and ,] so [now] [they're going [to] get] even . 
B|51| M: Right . 
A|52| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|53| M: [I mean [,] you know ,] 
A|54| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| M: _But_ [, uh] . 
A|56| B: _Yeah ._ 
B|57| M: [So _,] it's [,_ [it] was] [really] [a] tough issue [, but] [I think] _that [,_ uh] [you know] _you have _to_ do_ [, _you] have_ [a] background check [to] [make] [sure] [that] [you're] buying something [right] [, and _that] _,_ you [,_ you] _don't [,_ you] can't [say] [that it's not] authentic . 
A|58| B: [So] [what] [was] [the] verdict , [what] [was] [the] results [there .] 
B|59| M: [Well] [, the] result [was] _that [,_ uh] [the , the] defendant [did] [not have] [a] defense . 
A|60| B: [Oh] . 
B|61| M: He [was] found [not] _guilty_ [of] [it .] 
A|62| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| M: _I don't [,_ I _,] I'm not sure_ _that [,_ _that] [,_ [I] mean _,] I've_ heard [it [,] but] [I] haven't [, you know [,] I] haven tought [about] [it .] 
A|64| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| M: _But_ [, uh] . 
A|66| B: The [, the] penalty phase [, yeah ,] they've , [decide] [the] penalty separately from [the] verdict . 
B|67| M: Right . 
A|68| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| M: _But_ [, uh] . 
A|70| B: [Yeah ,] well [, you know [,] you] [just] [have [to] decide] [, you know ,] well [there's] [really] two separate decisions [there] [I] guess , [one] [is] , [did] _it really_ _happen_ [the] way [the , the] prosecutor said [it] happened [, you know ,] [is] this man [really] [guilty] [, and] [you have [to] decide] [that [,] but] then [you have [to] decide] [, you know ,] [as a] member [of] [society] [what] [do] [I] want [to do] with this guy who [did] this _thing ._ 
B|71| M: [Well] [, [that] [,] that] _would_ [be] [a good] [idea] . 
A|72| B: [And] [that] [I [,] I've] never [been] [on] [a] jury [, I've] never had [that] experience [, I'm not sure] I'd look forward [to] making [that] kind [of] decision [about] [a] man's life . 
B|73| M: Uh-uh [. Well] [, I [,] uh] 
A|74| B: [Uh-huh] 
B|75| M: [I [, I] think] [that's] probably [one] [of the] worst things [I've] [ever] seen [happen] . 
A|76| B: [Uh-huh .] _Yeah [._ Well] [the] _thing_ I'd [be] most likely [to] attach [the] [death] penalty [to] [is the] violence [. [I] mean [,] [I] can] handle [people ,] [people] selling drugs [, you know [,] it's [,] it's] wrong [, but] [it [,] it's not] worth somebody [getting] executed [for] . [But] we hear so [much] [about] [the] violence [and] how [it's not] safe [to] walk [the] streets because somebody [, you know ,] these random drive [by] shootings [and that] sort [of] _thing ._ 
B|77| M: [Well] [, [it] [can] be] [. It] [can be] [, [it] really] [can be] [a] , [a] [very] , [very] bad [thing [.] [I] think] [that [,] uh] 
A|78| B: [And] [the people] I'd most likely want [to] sentence [to death] [are] [the people that] [just] show [a] [really] low regard [for] human life . That [, you know [,] you ,] never [know] when [they're going to] turn or hurt [the] next person because [it doesn't] [really] matter [to] [them] whether someone else gets hurt or [not] . 
B|79| M: [Yeah .] 
A|80| B: [And] so [I] go , these [are] [the] kind [of] [people] [I] [would] [like] [to get] out [of] [here] [and] [get] out [of] circulation [and] [say] [I don't ,] we [don't] accept your kind [in] our [society] . 
B|81| M: That's [right] . 
A|82| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| M: [but] [, uh] .
