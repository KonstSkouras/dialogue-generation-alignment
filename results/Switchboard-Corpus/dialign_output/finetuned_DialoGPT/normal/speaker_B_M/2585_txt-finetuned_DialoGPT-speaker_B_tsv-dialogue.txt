B|55| M: [Right .] 
A|56| B: [I] mean , [it's] like [people] [don't know ,] [what] [they] _say ,_

A|60| B: [Yeah] 
B|61| M: _But , [I_ [,] I think] [that's] one thing [that] [I think] [we've] _come_ [to] , [to] expect [in] [the] future , 
A|62| B: [But] anyway [, I] enjoy [it .] [They] [, they [,] the] kids I've worked [with] [so] far [have] been _Spanish_ speaking . 
B|63| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| B: [And] 
B|65| M: [Well ,] [that's] neat . 
A|66| B: [but] I'm applying [for] , [What] ? [Yeah [,] it] [is .] 
B|67| M: It's [Spanish] . 
A|68| B: [A] lot [of] our words [are] [the] same , 
B|69| M: [Yeah .] 
A|70| B: like [, you know , they] [just] change [the] pronunciation [a] little bit . 
B|71| M: [Right .] [Right .] 
A|72| B: [But , I] love [it [.] I] love [the] culture [, uh [,] [the] way] [that] [they [,] uh [,] they] respect education [and] [their] teachers [their] parents , [so] [much] more than , than _my_ [children] [do] [. You know ,] 
B|73| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|74| B: [and I] like [it [.] And] [what] I've been thinking [about] [doing] [is] volunteering [for] [this [,] uh ,] Asian center [that [,] a] Doctor Falk has started [, that] works [with the] [school] district . 
B|75| M: Uh , [that's] _wonderful_ . 
A|76| B: [And] [doing] [what] , trying [to] get [them] set up , inculturated , [into the] [system] . 
B|77| M: [Right .] 
A|78| B: [I] thought [that] would [be] [good] experience [for] [me .] 
B|79| M: [Yeah .] 
A|80| B: [And ,] I've applied at another district where many [of] [the] [children] [are] Asian . 
B|81| M: [Yeah .] 
A|82| B: [And [I] think] [that] would [be] [wonderful] too . 
B|83| M: [Yeah .] 
A|84| B: [Right .] 
B|85| M: [So] [that ,] [that's] [a] real negative [, I think] . 
A|86| B: [Well [,] the] times [were] different too . 
B|87| M: [Oh] , yeah . 
A|88| B: [My] neighbor , let's [see] , [is] Jewish [. And] he's [going] through [the [,] I don't know [,] the] Jewish League [or] something [. And] [helping] [a] family [that's] [come] over from Russia . 
B|89| M: [Uh-huh .] 
A|90| B: [And] he spends [, well ,] _right_ [now] , he's down [to] like once [a] week , [but] he [was] [going] over there several times [a] week [to] [be] [with the] family [, and] [help] [them [with] the] [language .] 
B|91| M: [Oh] [, uh [,] uh] . 
A|92| B: [And] he thoroughly enjoyed [it .] 
B|93| M: [Oh] , [that's] great . 
A|94| B: No . 
B|95| M: [I don't know] . 
A|96| B: [Uh-huh .] 
B|97| M: [But [,] uh] . 
A|98| B: [Uh-huh .] What's [so] sad [about] [this] [is] both [of] [the , the] man [and] [the] woman had [a] degree having [to] [do] [with] computers [but ,] [their] training isn't [what] we need [in] [this] [country] . 
B|99| M: [Right .] 
A|100| B: [And] because [they're] [so] deficient [in] English [, they] haven't been [able] [to] get jobs . 
B|101| M: [Right .] 
A|102| B: [So] they'll [have] [to] go back [and] get [a] degree here [. You know ,] almost start [all] over . 
B|103| M: [That's true .] 
A|104| B: No , no [. And] [this] woman [was] [, uh ,] stocking [the] shelves [in a] drugstore . 
B|105| M: [Oh] , [my] . 
A|106| B: [I] feel sorry [for] her . 
B|107| M:  !!! % !! Remind [me .]
