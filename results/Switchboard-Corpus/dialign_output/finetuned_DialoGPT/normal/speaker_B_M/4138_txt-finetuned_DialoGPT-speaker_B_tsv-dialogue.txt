B|3| M: Well , that's true . 
A|4| B: _Uh ,_ _you're_ very fortunate . 
B|5| M: _and , uh_ 
A|6| B: We _just_ try not to _pay_ any _more_ in than _we have_ to [, uh] _, we_ _pay_ in _a_ substantial amount . _Uh ,_ 
B|7| M: Well [, we] [just] _, we have a_ _, a_ [, uh] [we] [just] [pay] [the] [state] _tax ,_ which _is_ [, uh] 
A|8| B: We don't regret paying taxes . We do _think that [,_ uh] , sometimes [, uh] [, we have a] reverse of [a] regressive [tax [,] a] progressive [tax] . 
B|9| M: [Uh ,] uh-hue . 
A|10| B: And progressive [tax _,] _I think_ [,_ uh] , does not give _people_ incentive to _make_ _more_ money , [and] what _I_ mean by _that ,_ [the] _more_ _income_ _you_ _make_ , [the] _more_ [tax] _you_ [pay] . 
B|11| M: Right . 
A|12| B: It should be _, _I think_ [,_ a] flat percentage [and , uh] , _that_ percentage ought to be an equitable amount . 
B|13| M: _Yeah_ [, I] agree . 
A|14| B: [Uh ,] last year when _they_ passed [the] [tax] laws for [the] [, uh] , nineteen ninety , ninety-one , whatever , nineteen ninety-one [uh] [, I] added up all [the] taxes _that_ [we] were going to [pay] on all these different specific luxury items [and] travel expenses [and] everything else , 
B|15| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|16| B: [and] [I] totaled them all up [and] basically [, uh] [, we] were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent [tax] . 
B|17| M: Huh . 
A|18| B: Now , _that_ was [the] assumption _that_ _you_ spent _that_ same dollar for every , for every item on there even though there's [, uh] , taxes on different things . 
B|19| M: [Uh ,] that's true . 
A|20| B: But _, you know ,_ there's there's [a] lot of taxes _you_ [pay] _that_ _you're_ not even aware of _that_ _you're_ paying [, uh] , like when _you_ buy [a] tire _, you_ [pay] [a] federal excise [tax] . 
B|21| M: Oh [, I] see . 
A|22| B: You [pay] gasoline taxes every time _you_ pump something into your , your tank . 
B|23| M: _Yeah_ . 
A|24| B: But _you_ _probably_ [pay] _more_ percentage wise in other taxes . 
B|25| M: _Yeah_ , that's true . [I think [,] I think] [it's] [probably] [more] obvious [that] [people] [have] , [have a] , [have] [, uh] [a] lower [income] . 
A|26| B: [Yeah] if _you_ implemented [a] flat percentage , it would encourage [people] [, uh] , to _make_ [more] money [and] [the] , what [people] need to understand in my opinion , now this [is] [just] my opinion , okay [, uh] , [is] [that] businesses create jobs [and] jobs create [income] [and] [income] pays taxes . 
B|27| M: Right . 
A|28| B: And , so , if _they_ penalize businesses , business [people] _are_ smart enough to say , here's my break point , I'm not going to work any harder _and make_ any [more] or create any [more] jobs . 
B|29| M: Right . 
A|30| B: And so , Based on _that ,_ who do _you_ [think] _you're_ talking to , _you're_ talking to an employer . 
B|31| M: [I think] that's true . [I [think] that [,] I think] [it's] important [that] [they] check [you] out [and make] sure [you're] [, you] [are [,] you know ,]
