A|38| A: _Oh , yeah_ ? 
B|39| B: [I] can't _believe_ [they have] [the] nerve [to [do] [that] .] 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh] , huh . Do [you] _think_ [they] _should be_ punished _at all_ , _or [,_ uh [,] like] go [to] prison [, uh _,] because_ [they're] [not] [really] [a] danger [to] society . It _was almost_ [really] self defense , isn't [it ,] [in] [a] case [like] [that .] 
B|41| B: [But] [, then [,] what] [do] _I [know_ [,] I don't] [have] any [kids] . No , none [at all] 
A|42| A: Well [, I] [do] [, uh ,] little aerobics [, oh ,] three [or] four times [a] week [, but it's] [not] _enough to ,_ boy [if] [I] go , _in the_ summer [time] [I] try [to] jog , jog [a] couple [of] miles 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [You know [,] it's] _just [,_ but it's] frightening [to] _us_ _because_ we [live] [pretty] far [from] her . She's down [in] Temple 
B|45| B: _That_ [should] [get] [you] close [enough to ,] [to be] able [to] find _it [._ [I] think] _it's [,_ uh _,] probably_ listed [in the] restaurants [, you [know] .] 
A|46| A: What did [you] [do] , put [it] together ? 
B|47| B: To [get] [them] on [their] , [Yeah .] 
A|48| A: [That's] coming up [here] [pretty] soon . _Is_ [it] _this_ weekend ? 
B|49| B: [Is] [that] [right] ? I'll [heard] [there] [was] [some] [stuff] on [the ,] on [the] radio _that was_ equivalent [to] _C_ _N_ _N_ . 
A|50| A: _Oh ,_ [that's] _great_ . 
B|51| B: No [one] [would] want [the] [job] 
A|52| A: Tried [to] [get] fondue [and] white wine [, and] [that [was] ,] 
B|53| B: _so , _it's_ [,_ it's] [really] sad 
A|54| A: Well , [that's] [a] full [time] [job] . 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [I] [believe] [it] [is] [too] . 
B|57| B: [And [,] uh ,] there's , there's [a lot] _involved_ _there ._ 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh . [Uh-huh .] Yeah _, well ,] I_ tell [you] once [you] [get] used [to] [having] [them] [you , you] [get] spoiled [really] quickly . 
B|59| B: [and it] turns _out_ [great] [, [because] [I] mean] , [you've got] [like] hot sauce [and] taco meat [and] barbecue [and [,] you know ,] bacon [and] [all] [that] _good_ [stuff] . 
A|60| A: [Yeah .] 
B|61| B: Uh , [not] [if] [it's] done fairly [. And] [that's] [probably] _my_ question [is] , [how] , [how] [do] [you know] [it's] done fairly . 
A|62| A: [Yeah .] Well [, I] [I know] [that] , _for_ instance , [in the] [N] [C] double A , [they] drug test [and] [it's] [not] random . 
B|63| B: [But] , [one] _thing_ [, I think] [that] [if] [there] [is] [a] chance [for] rehabilitation [then] [that] chance [should be] investigated . 
A|64| A: Well _, _it_ was_ [good] talking [to] [you] . 
B|65| B: Italian food 
A|66| A: [That's] , [that's] [, uh ,] [that's] [real good] . 
B|67| B: [or ,] 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [Yeah , well] [that's] , he's [got] [a] [job] [there] [and] _this_ [is] his [first] year , [so , it's] [been] [a real] interesting [thing] [for] [them] 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: There's [a lot of] folks [, probably] [, that] [are] [in] prison [that] [, uh [,] that] aren't [really] [a] danger [to] society , huh _, and , uh ,_ 
B|73| B: [Yeah .] 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [And [, and] , uh [,] it] will come [back to] haunt [us] [, it] seems [to] come [in] cycles . 
A|76| A: In Africa [was] _the men_ [and] women [and [,] and] had nothing [to do] [with] [that] [, and] [it's] huge over [there .] [So] [I [, I] [,] you know [,] and] [it's] beginning , _other_ [countries] [that's] what's his point . This [was] [an] international , conference where people [are] saying [, well [,] but] [in] [my] country [it's [,] you know [,] like] _this_ . 
B|77| B: [And] [one] [of [the] men] [got] [, uh [,] [I think] [it] was] seventeen years [and the] [other] [one] [was] [in] [for] [, uh ,] life imprisonment . 
A|78| A: Do [you] [have] annual family reunions [or ,] 
B|79| B: [But] [our] shepherd [was almost] thirteen years [old] [, and [it] [just] [,] you know ,] [was almost] cruel [because ,] 
A|80| A: Well [, [I] am] [a] travel agent [at] heart [, and] [my] hobby [is] [just [,] I] _love_ traveling [and [,] and] being [involved] [of] [that] [and] finding [out] more [, uh [,] [but] [,] it's] [real] hard [to] [work] [in the] summers [and] holidays [and] weekends [when] [you] [have] four children [and] [a] husband , [so] [I] reluctantly gave [that] career up [and] [am] [just] substituting [at] [the] school , 
B|81| B: Right . 
A|82| A: [So] [, I] couldn't [believe] [it .] [That] [was [,] [that] was] [really] hard . 
B|83| B: [And [,] uh [,] well] [I] fell [in] [love] [with] [this] [, uh [,] [it's] a] Chinchilla Persian [, and , uh ,] brought [him] home , 
A|84| A: [Oh] . 
B|85| B: [Oh , yeah] 
A|86| A: Not [for] [the] price ? 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|88| B: [That's] true [if] , [if] [it's] on [the] credit card [it] [doesn't] seem [like] [it's] money [out] [of] your pocket . Sometimes [you] may [think [,] well [, I] don't] [have] [the] money [so] [you] [use] [the] credit card [it's like] fake money [or something] .
