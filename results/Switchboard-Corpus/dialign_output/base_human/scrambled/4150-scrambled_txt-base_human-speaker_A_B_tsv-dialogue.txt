B|25| B: [Oh] yes , absolutely nuts . [But] [, uh ,] luckily enough _, you know [,_ we] found [the] cat [in] _time_ [and [,] uh ,] rushed him _to_ [the] vet [and it] took us about six weeks [of] [in and] _out_ [of the] vet [and] surgery [and ,] 
A|26| A: _Right ._

B|29| B: [Oh [,] okay] . 
A|30| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|31| B: [Well ,] [good] luck _to_ [you] [there] [in] Idaho . 
A|32| A: he's _just_ [there] [to] serve his [time] _, and_ _get_ _back_ [out] _on the_ street . 
B|33| B: How many square feet _do _you_ have_ ? 
A|34| A: [I] [have] [a] sister [that] used [to] _live_ [in] Sevren . 
B|35| B: [And] [as] long [as] we're [the] largest [, uh ,] consumer , [then] [, uh _,] this_ _is the_ market . 
A|36| A: [Oh ,] [no] [, [I mean] [,] this] whole _thing [,_ like] [for] two months _or something [,_ do [you] know] ? 
B|37| B: [I] [can] [I] [can] [just] [do] [it] 
A|38| A: _Um_ _. _Uh-huh ._ Uh-huh . Right_ , lots [of] their picture [and] [life] story [and everything .] 
B|39| B: [Yeah [,] well] _if_ [you could] call [it] [a] _benefit that_ C M U [, I mean] _the other thing_ [that] [they] allow _you to do_ [here] _while_ [you] _are_ working _is _,_ is_ consult [for] [, um _,] you know ,_ _other_ companies . 
A|40| A: _Right_ , right . 
B|41| B: On [the] grill , we'll [take] [the] [back] strap [and] soak [it] [in] Italian dressing [for a] couple [of] _hours and_ throw [it] [on the] grill 
A|42| A: That _was_ [good] [, I] [think] . [And] _, and_ [the other] book [I] am trying [to] [think] [, you know [,] like] _was_ [in the] last year [and] [I] [think] _I did_ read Tom Wolfe [and] VANITY [, uh ,] 
B|43| B: So _what was_ [the] verdict , _what was_ [the] results [there] . 
A|44| A: [Yeah [,] I , I] read [a] few articles off [in the] newspaper [and] some publications [where] stress [, uh ,] [for] those [people] [that] [are] laid off [and] also [for] those [people] [that] [are] [not] laid off [but] _were_ threatened [with] [a] layoff [and] threatened [with] [a] reduction [in] their company [is] extremely [high] right now . 
B|45| B: So [I'm] [either] _going to_ be [, I'm] [either] _going to_ starve [to] death [or] [I'm] _going _to_ get_ over [it and] [just] [go] ahead [and] eat [as] healthily [as] [I] possibly _can [, you_ know] . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: The basics [. [Right] [.] _Yeah] ._ That's _what_ [we] [do] _too_ . 
A|48| A: oh , gosh [and it's] so hard [because] [, you know ,] everybody [is] wanting [to] [go] [on] [and] [get] [the] sentence done _, and_ [if] [you're] trying [to] hold [out] [, you know ,] there's so [much] pressure [on] [you] [and] you've [got] [to] come up [with] [a] decision . 
B|49| B: Are [you] [, uh ,] transit _usually_ ? [I mean] [do you] _stay_ [not in] one [place] _too_ long ? 
A|50| A: Uh , Dallas [is] having quite [a] few . Seems [like] most [of] ours [are] occurring [in] late [at] night [or] _, or_ [, like] [I] say , drug related . Uh [, I guess] [the other thing] [was] [that] [are] causing [a] lot [of the] crime now [is the] decrease [in] values . Seems [like] [a] _, a_ lot [of] [people] [don't] hold human [life] quite [as] [high] [as] perhaps [they] used [to] . 
B|51| B: [Yeah ,] _they were_ . 
A|52| A: [Yeah [,] the] population's been [really] up . They've [, uh ,] they've had longer hunting seasons than [that] even [to get] rid [of] more [of] [them , because] [they were] [, uh ,] increasing so [much] . 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh , yes . 
A|54| A: [Well ,] _I'll_ let [you] [go] [it's ,] 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: _I did_ [too] _, and_ [you have] [a] [good] day . 
B|57| B: The [thing [,] [the] other thing] [is [the] , [I] don't] [like] [the] rain [either .] 
A|58| A: [Oh] . 
B|59| B: [Well ,] that's [the] same [thing] [that] [I did] . [I] hope [I'll] be able _to do_ [the] same [with] grandchildren . 
A|60| A: [I] haven't been [on] vacation [in a] [while] [either _.] Um ,_ [usually] when [we] [go] [, we] [go] [to] Colorado , [to] Estes Park area . Which [is] up _kind of_ near Denver . [And] [, uh ,] [stay] [in the] mountains up [there] [, do] [a] little hiking [and] resting , [get] away from [the] Texas heat [, that] _kind of_ [thing] . 
B|61| B: [that] [should] be [life] _, _but_ ,_ instead _, in _,_ in_ given [the] choice [of] [either] sentencing [to] death [, or] sentencing [to] [life] , they'll give [them] ninety [years] [in] prison [or something [,] [and] then] turn around [in] thirty [years] [, _that] [,_ you know [,] and] less they're [out] . 
A|62| A: [You] [can , you] [can] tell [them] anything [and] [they] won't tell anybody . 
B|63| B: [I] [we] [live] [out] [in the] country . 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|65| B: [I] [thought] [that] _would_ be [good] experience [for] [me] . 
A|66| A: [I ,] [I'll] agree [it] [, it's not] [your] responsibility [but [,] is] [it] also legal , [for] [you to do] [that] ? from [what] [I] understand from various net readings [, it] [, the] Federal government [is] [going to] try [to] legislate [a] more aggressive enforcement [of] state tax schemes [, uh [,] in ,] into [place] [in the] next few [years] . [It] [is [,] it] [is] [a] lost revenue stream right now [and] states [can] use [all the] revenue [they] [can] [get] . With some , [with something] [like] [that [,] do] [your] arguments still apply ? 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [but [,] uh [,] it] has quieted down [, but] [I don't think] [they] probably [feel] any differently , 
B|69| B: The vet _called_ her [, uh [,] a] golden mix 
A|70| A: No . 
B|71| B: [I'm] [a] summer person 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] 
B|73| B: [Well [,] [it's] [,] uh , [we] have] [, uh [,] uh ,] [kind of] [a] core group [that [,] that] serves [as] , quote , officers [of the] organization , 
A|74| A: [Right .] 
B|75| B: [Right .] [Well ,] that's [good] [. Um ,] how many children [do [you] have] ? 
A|76| A: Uh , [as] [a] course [for] P E [you know] so [I] [could] graduate . 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh . [Right] .] 
A|78| A: [I don't think] [I] [would] [go] through [that] expense . One [other] [benefit that] [you] mentioned [is the] flexible work [hours and] [in] [my] previous job [, I] [really] enjoyed [because] [they] had [what was] [called] flex schedule [where] [I] [could] [go] [and] [I] [could] work [, uh ,] nine hour days [and] [have] [like] Friday only work four [hours]
