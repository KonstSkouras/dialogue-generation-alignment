B|61| B: [Yeah ,] she's [the] oldest . And [she] [, well] [in] fact [I] [got] [her] when [I] moved [out] [of] [the] house also . 
A|62| A: [Yeah ,] this [is] probably unusual topic [to] [give] two [of] us _in the_ same city . 
B|63| B: [Well [,] we] , [That's] [true] [and] [you] [don't] [want] [them] [to] [not] [be] able [to] come [because] [there's] _no_ room . 
A|64| A: [You] [don't] 
B|65| B: Um , [as] far [as] [the] new hires [, I , I] hired [on] [just] early enough [that] [I , I] missed [it] .

A|66| A: [and] [how] [they] [just] [well] [, it] hasn't been [just] [but] [it] [was] [in [the] [,] [I think] the] second or third quarter [of] [last] year , nineteen ninety 
B|67| B: [Well ,] um [, I [,] uh ,] exercise regularly . [I] work at [a] university [, [and] I] swim almost every day upwards [of] [a] mile , 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: _Right ._ 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
B|71| B: [Right .] 
A|72| A: _Oh ,_ yeah [, I] agree [, because] [it's] [not] fair [to] those [of] us [that [,] that] deserve [a] safe [, you know ,] life [to] [have [to] ,] 
B|73| B: [So .] 
A|74| A: [Yeah .] 
B|75| B: Course [they] [have] such [a] crime problem [because they] [have] such [a] unemployment rate . 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [Oh _,] you like_ [the] rain [, do you] ? 
A|78| A: [but] [then] [it] [depends] [on] who [you are] calling [on] . Who [you're] [, you like] [your] minister standing [up] [in] front [of] [you] [with] [no] tie [, you] [just [,] uh ,] [he] [would be] missing something . 
B|79| B: [Uh] [So ,] [they] , [they] [, uh ,] [don't] [have] _too_ many facilities [it] seems [for] _their_ personal items . Very limited space waste 
A|80| A: [Because] [we] [have] [, you know ,] everywhere [that] [a] tree [is] down [people] need help [and ,] [we're] [all] , [all] , [a lot] [of] older folks need help getting , [their] yards cleaned [out] [because they] can't afford [to] pay anyone 
B|81| B: Are [you] Mormons ?
