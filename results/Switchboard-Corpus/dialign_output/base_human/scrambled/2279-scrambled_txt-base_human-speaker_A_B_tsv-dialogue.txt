A|0| A: _Yeah ,_ _yeah _,_ well _,_ it _, it_ , it_ _went_ pretty , pretty quick _from_ _what_ _he_ said . 
B|1| B: [Yeah _,] they_ _um ,_ ours _would_ _still_ _back_ _up_ _to the_ dog _or_ cat _when_ [he] _got_ mad _and_ try _to_ perfume them _, but_ _the_ glands _had_ _been_ removed 
A|2| A: [and] _some_ boy _she_ tried _to get_ _rid _of_ _,_ he_ _was_ _like_ _in_ _his_ twenties , 
B|3| B: W R R [and] _the_ Oasis _are_ _the_ two _that_ _I_ listen _to ,_ more than _anything else_ . 
A|4| A: Huh . 
B|5| B: _Oh _,_ I_ _see_ . 
A|6| A: _But_ [he] jumped _in_ _, _in _the_ ,_ the_ river . 
B|7| B: _So_ _when I_ drive [the] car [in the [,] in the] driveway [in the] afternoon [, it , it] _will_ _just_ drive [it] _up on_ _a_ ramp _that_ _actually_ puts _me_ _on_ top [of] [the , _the] , uh ,_ pressure side _of a _,_ uh ,_ hydraulic cylinder . 
A|8| A: _well ,_ _about_ nursing homes _, _and_ , and_ older _people ._ 
B|9| B: _I just_ _don't_ understand _why _they_ _,_ so_ _much_ want [to] _just_ stay [in] _that_ building . 
A|10| A: _Yes_ . 
B|11| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|12| A: [Yeah .] 
B|13| B: My mother has dogs [and] _I'm_ _like ,_ _no_ . 
A|14| A: _You_ _feel_ [it ,] [don't] _you_ ? 
B|15| B: [Yeah .] 
A|16| A: [Yeah .] 
B|17| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Right ._ 
A|18| A: Really ? _I ,_ 
B|19| B: Anyway . [You] [don't] _have_ children ? 
A|20| A: Bye-bye . 
B|21| B: _Right ._ 
A|22| A: [Yeah .] 
B|23| B: How many stories ? Just _one ?_ 
A|24| A: [Oh ,] Chris Xeros . 
B|25| B: [Yeah .] 
A|26| A: [Oh _,] that's_ _interesting ._ 
B|27| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: _I don't_ _know ,_ 
B|29| B: _I mean _,_ I_ [went] _up_ _, I_ didn't _go_ _out_ _there_ _for_ [about] three days _, you know ,_ because [I [,] _and] I_ [went] _out_ _there_ _one_ _day_ [and] [the] plant [was] nothing left _but_ _a_ stem , 
A|30| A: [Yeah _,] it's_ _not_ [a] bad idea . [Uh-huh .] _Sure _,_ _sure_ ,_ 
B|31| B: [Yeah .] 
A|32| A: _And_ now [I'm] [a] college educated builder There's [still] [no] _work_ [, you know] . 
B|33| B: [and] [it ,] [his] mother [was] alone [, and] _so_ _they_ came [to] support her [, _and] then_ _one_ by _one_ , [his] _you know ,_ [his] sisters [, he] began [to] lose family members , 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: _Uh-huh , uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: _Yeah , and_ _if_ [you] add _it , if_ [you] put [a] footnote [in] [, in the] middle [, you know _,] if_ [you] come [up] _with_ _some_ new piece [of] documentation [and] [you] put [that] [in the] middle _of your_ paper _and _have_ to_ footnote [it [,] you] [just] change _, um [,_ it] [just] automatically changes _all your_ footnoting numbers [for] [you] . 
B|37| B: [Oh ,] wow . 
A|38| A: Exactly , 
B|39| B: [You] _do_ [the] same . 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|41| B: _I think_ [it's] , Four _or_ five , 
A|42| A: _Yes_ . 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: Okay , bye-bye . 
B|45| B: _Uh _, I_ think_ [, well _,] something_ _on_ [the] order _of a_ three series [, _it's] probably_ _different_ . Once [you] [get] [up] [in the] five series [and] higher , _then_ , [all your] repair costs _go_ [up] significantly 
A|46| A: Let's [see] , mine's pretty easy [actually] . [Uh , [I] just] [got] _done_ reading [a _,] a_ magazine [or] [a] couple magazine articles [about] [the , uh ,] new Saturns . 
B|47| B: [and] upstairs _we_ [have] [a] bath [, a] bath , oh _we_ _, have_ [a] half bath downstairs _, too_ . 
A|48| A: [Oh ,] _yeah_ . 
B|49| B: [Yeah , and] [she] , oh baths . [Oh] gee , [she] hated baths worse than _anything_ _. It was_ [, it] [was] [just] _really a_ fight _to , you know ,_ [get] her clean . 
A|50| A: Yep _, they [,_ _a] lot _of_ _,_ um _,_ [of_ a _,] um ,_ winter produce comes _from_ South America . 
B|51| B: _We_ _never_ _could get_ [it] declared [a] lemon [, and] [the] car _would_ _go_ [and ,] without any warning whatsoever [, you] _could_ _be_ _going_ down [the] freeway _at_ sixty [and] [it] _would_ _stop_ 
A|52| A: [Right .] 
B|53| B: [And] [, and] [that] way _we_ _can_ _be_ [sure [,] you know _,] we_ _can_ find _out_ [the] truth _, we_ _can_ find _out_ [what] _really_ happened [and , and] base [the] sentence _on_ [what] [the] person _did_ , [not] _on_ [what] _we're_ allowed [to] let [the] jury hear 
A|54| A: Huh-uh . 
B|55| B: [Yeah [,] I] _do_ _too_ . 
A|56| A: [Yeah ,] [why] [, _I] don't_ _know , _I_ [, I_ think] they're _kind of_ nice [to] [have] , they're _kind _of_ [,_ you _know ,] just_ relaxing [to [,] _I] don't_ [know _,] to_ pet [and] [to [,] _I] don't_ [know ,] [when] [they] [like] sit [up on] [your] lap [and] _stuff_ [like] _that _,_ just_ _kind of_ enjoyable [to , you know [,] have] [like [,] _I] don't_ [know [,] something] giving [you] _some_ affection _as_ [well] . 
B|57| B: [And] [, uh _,] we_ [, I] _do_ [some] [interesting] _recycling_ _things ._ 
A|58| A: _But_ _there's_ [a ,] 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|60| A: I've tried _to do_ [that] _with_ sugar 
B|61| B: [I'm] [in] Rome , New York . 
A|62| A: [Yeah _.] [Yeah_ , and] [get] _even_ _with_ _who_ _, I mean ,_ 
B|63| B: _What_ [kind of] crimes _would_ [you] use [it] [for] ? 
A|64| A: _Sure_ . 
B|65| B: [And] [, and] [the] _one_ person _I know_ [that] has _one_ [, they [,] they] [feel] guilty . She has this continual guilt trip [that] she's [not] _doing_ [the] _right_ thing [, and] _so_ [on] [, uh ,] [on] weekends [she] _would_ [, you know ,] spend [all] [of] her _time_ [with] her kids [and] spend lots [of ,] lots [and] lots [of] money . Basically [, I think] [they [,] they] _really_ spoil [the] child [, to] try [to] overcompensate [for] _their_ guilt feelings . 
A|66| A: [And] [you] _wonder_ [why they] _can't_ [just] [stop] [it] . 
B|67| B: [Uh [,] it] starts [with] [a] K . 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: [Sure ,] _go_ ahead . 
A|70| A: _Well [,_ I] _can't_ [think] [of] [anything else] [really] [about] [the] polls [or] voting [, to] talk [about] . 
B|71| B: _And [I_ , I] [really] [think] [that] _we're_ , _we're_ falling by [the] wayside [with] [not] incarcerating these [people .] 
A|72| A: _But_ [do] [you] [feel] though [, uh ,] craftsmanship _is_ [much] superior [to the] American abilities ? 
B|73| B: _So you_ , 
A|74| A: [Oh ,] [really] . 
B|75| B: [Right .] 
A|76| A: If [you] [don't] [like] wildlife [it's probably] [not] [of] interest _But_ [it _,] that_ [was] [really] , [really] fabulous [and] [just] [the] photos [I] [have] [of] [it] [and] gosh , incredible [and] [be] [so] close , 
B|77| B: [Oh [,] that] sounds _like a_ _fun_ , _fun_ field . 
A|78| A: [Uh-huh , uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: It's an aerobic exercise [and] [it's] an hour straight . [And] [it's] _just [,_ uh [,] it's] _a lot of_ [fun] . 
B|81| B: Liked [to] kill _me_ , because [I] [it] [was] [, I] didn't [have] [that] group cooperation [, I] _did_ [, it] by myself . 
A|82| A: [right] _. Yeah ._ 
B|83| B: [And] _we_ choose [to] bring congealed salad . [You] _can_ bring [a] congealed vegetable salad , [as] opposed [to] potato salad . 
A|84| A: _Well ,_ most families , most families [are] young [and] both [people] [are] working . 
B|85| B: [And] _there_ [are] distinct breeds [in] Europe . Now [what] happened over here [was] [is] [that] [people] saw [the , the] first [, um ,] which _would_ [actually] [have] _been_ [a] Skutzhund which [is] [what] Rin Tin Tin [was] . 
A|86| A: _that's_ [still] fairly new . 
B|87| B: [Yeah _.] So_ how old [is] [your] retriever ? 
A|88| A: [Uh [,] so] [, uh [,] _I] would_ say _that's_ [probably] [their] prime motivation . They'll , they'll stock [your] house [and [,] uh ,] look [at] [your] pattern [and then] [go] _from_ [there] . 
B|89| B: [Yeah .] 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: _but_ _we're_ _going to_ ignore [it] 
A|92| A: Is [she] [the] oldest [one ?] 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: _Uh-huh . [Yeah_ [,] you] [can] [get] away [with] [it] _even_ having [a] semi nice dinner , 
B|95| B: [But] , [then] [, you [know [,] I] think] [that [,] that] [some] murderers [don't] [really] warrant capital punishment . [You] [know , [just] ,] [like ,] [for] example _, uh , you know [,_ you] hear [about] cases _where_ women [have] killed [their] husbands [who] abused them 
A|96| A: _Well ,_ [right] now [we're] [just] renting [, but] [it] _is a_ home . _Um ,_ 
B|97| B: [I would] love _to be_ called , [I'm] ready [to] [go] They [just] haven't called _me_ [up] yet 
A|98| A: [Uh-huh .] [And [I] know] [when I] spent [, the] [time] [that] I've studied [in] Mexico [, uh ,] Spanish [was] [one] [of] my majors [in] college [, [that] [,] uh ,] [there] [was] [a] [kind _of] a lot of_ resentment [there] towards America , 
B|99| B: [You] [know , [I] know] [we're] [not] supposed [to do] this long distance [but] [actually] [I'm] getting [a] call _. I_ [wonder] [if] [I] _could_ possibly _take_ [it] [on] call waiting . Could [I] ask [you] [to] hold [one] minute ? 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] [What] [did] [they] name _him_ ? 
B|101| B: [I don't] remember [one] , [from] [one] station [to] another _. I_ keep forgetting [one] station . What's [your] second favorite ? 
A|102| A: _Oh ._ Huh [. _I] can_ _I can_ _believe_ [that] . 
B|103| B: [And] _doing_ [what] , trying [to get] them set [up] , inculturated , into [the] system . 
A|104| A: [So] [was] [I] . 
B|105| B: Wow . [You] better [believe] [it , if] [, you] _wouldn't_ [even] [have to] leave [it [,] I mean ,] 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [Uh [, I] think] [so] _. It_ should [be] . 
A|108| A: Sounds [like a] place _where I_ grew [up] 
B|109| B: [Well [,] the] jury [that] sentenced [him] , sentenced [him] [to] death 
A|110| A: _Oh yeah ,_ _yeah_ . [We] [did] _a lot of_ [different] [things .] We'd [stop] [when] [we] wanted [to [,] that] [kind _of] stuff_ [. So] [, we] [kind of] [did] [a] little bit [of] hiking _, [sure_ [,] and] [a] little bit [of [,] uh ,] sightseeing [, uh ,] [different] areas . [Uh ,] sitting [back] [at] [different] areas [and] spending hours [, we] [never] [had] [really a] [time] limit [, we] [just] [kind of] [did] [what] [we] wanted [to do] [for] [that] [day] . 
B|111| B: That's [, that's] [what] [, I] [like] _doing_ [things] [like] making lasagna [just] because [I can] [have] [it] ready [and] baking [in the] oven , 
A|112| A: [so] [I] figure [that] [that] [will] make [me] biased [and I] won't [be] chosen . 
B|113| B: [I think] [I know] [what] you're [is] [it] [like a] hand held ? 
A|114| A: [Yeah .] 
B|115| B: [But] [, uh [,] sure] [is a] heck [of a lot of] [work] . 
A|116| A: Were [you] [in the] band ? 
B|117| B: Hi . 
A|118| A: [Right .] 
B|119| B: _Yes ,_ oh [, of] course . 
A|120| A: [Right [.] [So] you] [probably] [wouldn't] recommend [that] [as] [a] big tourist spot ? 
B|121| B: [I'm] sorry [for] these beeps , 
A|122| A: [Yes [,] well ,] I've found [out] [, too] [, [that] [,] uh , you know [,] a] couple years ago , we've always [been] [recycling] newspaper [for] [the] last twelve years [, and] [at] [one] [time] [we] [could get] [a] pretty good return [, uh ,] [with] [the] Boy Scouts . [We] [could] [take] [and] collect [the] newspaper , 
B|123| B: [Oh ,] wow . That [is] _really interesting ._ Are [you] saying [to] use [like [,] um ,] [for] chocolate [like ,] unsweetened , 
A|124| A: _Um [,_ so] , 
B|125| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|126| A: [And I] [had] [a] great [time] [doing] [that] [. It was] [really interesting .] 
B|127| B: [you know [,] of] course [there's] [still] [a lot of] [work] _to be_ [done] [, [and] then] [when] [you] [get] [it] completely [, you know [,] the] shell finished [, uh , you] [still] [have] [a lot [of] stuff] [to do] inside [, but] [, uh ,] 
A|128| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|129| B: An experiment . 
A|130| A: [Yeah .] 
B|131| B: [Oh yeah ,] oh [, the] whole [time] [I] [was] pregnant [they] kept saying , [are] [you] getting [rid [of] your] cats , [are] [you] getting [rid [of] your] cats . [You] [can't] [be] pregnant [and have] cats . [I'm] [like [,] uh ,] [no] , [no] , [no] . 
A|132| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|133| B: [Um ,] [I'm] [done] , [where I] [work] . 
A|134| A: [Um] . 
B|135| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|136| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|137| B: [Uh-huh [. Yeah] .] 
A|138| A: [So] he's [going [to] be] [with] [, uh ,] regular pitching 
B|139| B: [But] [, uh ,] 
B|140| B: [Oh .]
