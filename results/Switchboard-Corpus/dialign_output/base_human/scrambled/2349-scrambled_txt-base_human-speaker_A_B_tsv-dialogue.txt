A|48| A: Sure . 
B|49| B: [Well [, it] was] good talking [to] [you] too . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: Ooh . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: [Yeah [,] I] guess [so .] [It] [really] [sounds like] [it was] fun . 
A|54| A: [Well , it] [sounds like] [you ,] you've got [your] _hands_ full 
B|55| B: One [that] [I] can't _find_ anymore which [is] GABRIEL'S FIRE . 
A|56| A: [it's [,] uh [,] you know ,] getting ready [and] taking _care of_ everything _. But_ [it's [,] um [,] it's] [really] refreshing . [So] , 
B|57| B: Yes _, we_ [, uh _,] uh , I_ haven't missed [a] [one] since I've [been] eligible [to] vote . 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: [Yeah ,] East Texas [is] recruiting [for] [, you know ,] [their] fall semester 
A|60| A: [Right .] 
B|61| B: [Right [,] [I] , I] usually _see_ _her_ [a ,] couple times [a] _year_ [so] [that's] no , no big [thing] [. But] _, uh , [I_ _,] uh , I_ [do] [, I] [do] enjoy [the] reunions . [The] [only] problem [is] [that] now [, uh ,] originally [when] _we had_ [them] [, uh [,] [they] were] mainly _my_ mother's 
A|62| A: [Yeah [.] But] [it's] funny [that [,] uh [, I] mean [,] like] [, you know , like] [I] said [I think] last [year] [was the] first [time] [in] [like] eighteen years [for] [Pennsylvania] . [I'm not] [even] sure [of] [that ,] [but] [for] some reason _I think [that_ [,] you know [,] it was] [something] [like [that] [.] [And] [,] it] surprised [, and] [even] Florida _, I know_ [they _have] [it_ [,] [and] you] [don't] [really] hear about [it real] often , [how] many _people ,_ 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: Tell [me] [what you] [like] [to] [do] . 
B|65| B: Wow ! That [really] surprises [me] . 
A|66| A: Five minutes _, oh ,_ okay . 
B|67| B: [Right [.] Well [, I] know] [like] [when] [I] [was in] high _school_ [and] junior high [and] stuff [and] sitting [down] [and] having [the] sex talk [with] mom [, you know] [and] _all_ [that] stuff , 
A|68| A: [but] [I think] [it] finally sunk [in] [, you know ,] [because] [she] saw some [of the] other [people] [and] [just] [like] [she] heard [them] [say] [, you know [,] well] [, I] [used] [a] credit card [. And] [my] husband's sister [is] [the] world's worst [at] _, oh [,_ well] , I'll [just] use [the] credit cards [and] [she] has [all of her] credit cards [up] [to] [the] limit . 
B|69| B: Okay [. And] [you] put [up ,] set [up] [the] track , pylons . Okay . 
A|70| A: [Well [,] [we] had] [a] vice principal shot [at] [here] last [year] [on] [the [,] you know ,] [on] [the] [school] grounds after [school] . 
B|71| B: [It] [is a] tough decision [and] [it's] [one] [that] needs [a] great deal [of] thought [, and] prior probably . 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] On [that] same topic , [have] [you] [ever] read anything about [, you know [,] the] Amelia Earhart story , whatever happened [with] [her] ? 
B|73| B: [And] [I mean [,] [I] think that] [what] this [is] _going to_ lead [to] [is] [people] will [take] _things_ into [their] own [hands] [. And] [that] innocent [people ,] 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: [And] _you're_ [in] Minneapolis , 
A|76| A: [But] [not] [all] country [. [I] don't] [like that ,] [when] [they] [start] , 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [Oh] [my] . 
B|79| B: [Oh ,] yeah [, oh ,] yeah . 
A|80| A: [I , I] [just] [don't] feel [right] [so .] There's lots [of] [places] _if you're going [to_ go] camping . K O [A] [are] [wonderful] . It's [kind of] [it's] [kind [of] the [,] uh ,] yuppie type [of] camping [because [they] have] showers [, [they] have] [things] [for] [kids] [to] [do] . They [have] swimming pools , [things] [like [that] .] If [you can] [find] [, uh ,] some [really] nice , [clean] [, uh ,] campgrounds versus [, uh [,] if you] [go] [to] state parks [, uh ,] 
B|81| B: Huh . [Uh-huh .] 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [Oh [,] _I] see ._ 
A|84| A: [and] [I'm] [saying] let's move [right] [on] 
B|85| B: Did [you] _see_ [that ,] where he [, the] [guy] asked him [for] proof [of] [who] he [was] , 
A|86| A: [I see .] [Do] [you [have] a] garden ? 
B|87| B: [Yeah .] 
A|88| A: That's about [the] [only] [real] bonus 
B|89| B: [and so it] seems [like] [it's] always [used] as [a] bedroom . 
B|90| B: [Well] [if you're] [, [if] you're going [to] [have] a] pet [, and] [not] [have it] neutered [or] spayed [you] need [to be] willing [to] [, you know] deal [with the] consequences , [take] [care [of] the] offspring
