B|9| B: _Right ._ 
A|10| A: [I] haven't had _my_ oldest _one_ quite _nine_ years [, I've] had him probably five years . 
B|11| B: [You] bet . 
A|12| A: _Yeah _._ Uh ,_ maybe , maybe [too] [a] big social change _that's_ _, that's_ maybe _for_ [the] worst _is_ _, uh _,_ is_ _, is_ _how_ [, um _,] the_ people's _, uh ,_ views _on_ , _on_ relationships _has_ changed _, you know [,_ and] _now_ [we] _have_ , _now_ [we] _have_ _several_ _, you know [,_ we] _have to_ worry [about] AIDS [and] [we] _have to_ worry _about , uh ,_ maybe people _are_ becoming _more_ aware , _more ,_ _more_ afraid [of] relationships . 
B|13| B: _but_ [, uh ,] 
A|14| A: _Oh _,_ yeah_ . 
B|15| B: [I] [like] mysteries _. I_ tape [, um ,] FATHER DOWLING _, because_ [that's] another mystery , 
A|16| A: [Right .] 
B|17| B: [Yeah .] 
A|18| A: _And_ _I think_ _it's_ _really_ very sad [that] _north_ _of the_ border _, you know , the_ United States [and] _Canada_ _is_ [so] _different_ _, from the from_ South America [, and] Central America . 
B|19| B: _Uh _, I_ guess_ _, I , uh [,_ I] [like] [to] play golf . 
A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: _It_ _, it's_ , 
A|22| A: No _, no [,_ I] haven't _. Uh [, I_ , uh ,] _my_ father pays _for_ _my_ , _my_ schooling , _my_ _tuition ._ _So_ [, uh _,] I'm_ [, I] haven't _made_ _use_ [of] [that] . 
B|23| B: [Well [,] I] lived across [the] street almost [from] [Canada] 
A|24| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|25| B: _Yes ,_ uh-huh [, that's] [it] 
A|26| A: [and ,] 
B|27| B: [But] [, you know _,] like_ , four _, I mean_ four _children_ [is] expensive , especially _when_ [you] consider [like] , especially [for] _me_ , which [I'm] _paying_ [out of] _state_ [tuition .] [I'm] _paying_ [, you know ,] three thousand [, no ,] _what_ [is] [it ,] _two_ thousand _six_ hundred dollars [for] [one] semester . 
A|28| A: _Oh_ definitely . 
B|29| B: [But] [it's] upper middle class [, uh ,] [kind of] an environment . 
A|30| A: See [you] next _time_ . Bye . 
B|31| B: [Yeah _.] _I_ guess_ [that's] _what_ retirement [is] [all] [about] . 
A|32| A: Is [that] _right_ ? [That's] [it] ? 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: _Um , I_ haven't [, I] haven't gotten [too] terribly _much_ _into_ _my_ _major_ yet . Actually [, um _,] the_ _, the_ degree [I'm] getting [is] physics _. There's a_ _different_ [one] [for] applied physics _so [I_ guess] [you] could call [it] _more_ straight _stuff_ than applied . 
B|35| B: [Right] , 
A|36| A: _Huh ._ 
B|37| B: [Uh] [it] [is] [to] [a] certain extent 
A|38| A: _And_ , yes , _you're_ _right _,_ I think_ _it's a_ sixties program [. _I] think_ [it] _was_ [one] [of] Kennedy's hot points [that] _he_ _, _that_ was_ his big deal . 
B|39| B: [It's] hard [to] find stick shift cars anymore . 
A|40| A: _I don't_ , oh , plus _, I mean _,_ the_ pooper scooper [one] New York , _so [,_ you know] . 
B|41| B: [Well ,] we're [about] [a] hundred miles [from] Pittsburgh [north .] 
A|42| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh] _, yeah [,_ that's] [it [,] I mean [,] that's] _about where_ almost [all [of] the] fat comes [from] 
A|44| A: Exactly . 
B|45| B: [But] [, uh _,] it's_ _, it's_ [still , [it] [,] it] [still] remains [a] tough question [and _,] it's_ , there's _a lot of_ [, you know , the] whole [, the] whole department [of] defense [, uh ,] reasoning behind [the] original plan [and] whatnot [. There's _a] lot of_ [different] _things _that_ [,_ uh ,] come [into] play _but_ _that was [, I_ think] [everybody] , [everybody] _pretty_ [much] knows [that] [that was] [kind [of] a] smoke screen [to] implement [it] throughout [the] whole _company_ . 
A|46| A: _And_ [then] , actually _, after_ _there_ [I] went [to] [um ,] Hawaii _, [a_ lot of] _my_ travel _has_ been sort [of] _based_ around conferences or _business_ meetings 
B|47| B: [Yeah .] 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [and] [so [,] uh [,] _that] _,_ it's_ [kind [of] a] seasonal thing . Three times [a] _year_ she's [really] busy _doing_ certain [things] [based] _on [that_ kind of] [business] , 
A|50| A: [I] never _get_ _home_ early enough [for] those five [and] [six] o'clock , 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [and] [that's] _not_ necessarily fair . 
B|53| B: _Well , yeah [,_ I think] [a lot of] times , [if] [you] [get] [a] brand _name_ [uh [,] you know ,] [if] [it's a] [, a] good brand , 
A|54| A: [Right .] 
B|55| B: [Uh] [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [I] _just_ _don't_ enjoy [the] _work_ [, that] [it] takes [to] [get] [it] _done_ . 
B|57| B: [Oh] [no] . 
A|58| A: _And_ [we] only _have_ [one] _. We_ tore [all] [the] rest [of] [them] _up_ . 
B|59| B: [you] [too] . 
A|60| A: [Right .] Just wasn't socially acceptable . 
B|61| B: How did [you] , _what_ did [you] [do] , 
A|62| A: _Huh_ _, well ,_ 
B|63| B: _I'd_ [, I] _would_ agree , _with_ [that] even [more [,] [I] don't] [know] [if] _this_ [is] cold [and] [too] pragmatically _but_ [I'm] [really] offended , by [the] thought [that] [I] [have to] support [, uh ,] [just] [the] existence [of] [, you know ,] murder , rapist [, you know ,] [right [,] _that] [,_ uh [,] after] [they've] gone [and] [done] horrible [things] , molested _children [,_ and] kill , [them] whatever [, _that] ,_ society [has] [to] _pay [,_ uh ,] upwards [, uh ,] thirty thousand dollars [a] _year_ [to] incarcerate [them] . 
A|64| A: _Okay ._ [Yeah .] 
B|65| B: [Huh .] 
A|66| A: [Uh ,] _she_ [has] Alzheimer's [and] does _not_ remember [, uh [,] [a] lot] [if] _anything_ . 
B|67| B: [That's] [how] [it] [is] _at_ our house _when_ [you're] _on the_ phone . [Oh _,] it's_ open , [anything] goes _when_ mom's _on the_ phone 
A|68| A: [I ,] _my_ _friend_ [is] _, is_ very generous [in] , [in] letting us [have] _my_ [children [,] uh ,] [do] [the] Suzuki method without [paying] [a lot] [out] . 
B|69| B: Scientific . 
A|70| A: [so] . 
B|71| B: [I think] [I think] we're _going_ [to] talk [about] parents spending [time] _with_ their [children] _. We ,_ [have] three [children] who [are] eleven , [nine] [, and] eight . 
A|72| A: I'll [have to] admit [I don't] [, _I] do_ _my_ own yard [. _I] , I_ [really] [don't] enjoy [doing] [that] [. I] enjoy having [a] nice looking yard , 
B|73| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: _It_ [, [it] _,] it's_ _pretty_ bad _here_ , [too] . 
A|76| A: [I] didn't [know] . 
B|77| B: [Oh _,] really ._ 
A|78| A: [Um [,] it] filled [, [a] lot of] people try [to] stay [away from] [this] [but] _I make_ _my_ own homemade pudding [just] [because] [I don't] [like] box pudding . 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: _Yes ._ 
B|81| B: [I] am [a] speech pathology [major] [and] [so [I] do] [a lot of] clinical [work] [and] _when [I_ do] clinic [work] _then I_ [have _to] , uh [,_ uh ,] _look_ [my] best . 
A|82| A: [Yeah .] 
B|83| B: _Yeah [,_ that's] [too] bad . 
A|84| A: [Oh _,] well [,_ yeah] 
B|85| B: [and] did [it] again _and , uh ,_ 
A|86| A: [Oh _,] well_ [that's] [okay] [, um ,] 
B|87| B: [Okay [.] Uh , I] [use] [them] both _here_ _at_ [work] [and] _at home_ . 
A|88| A: [Right .] Course , they'd [be] , they [would] [be] barred _, but_ 
B|89| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|90| A: [Uh _,] but_ [yeah [,] [that] was , I] highly recommend [that] way [to] [go] . If [you're] ever interested [in] [going] [the] route [, I] dealt [with] [this] woman , _her_ [name] [was] Rita [at] China Tours [in] Boston 
B|91| B: [Uh [,] not] [at] [all] _. In_ fact [, I'm] graduating [from] _college in_ [about] [a] week [and] [this] past semester [I've] taken _two_ criminal justice classes [and] [have] discussed [a lot] [on] trials . 
A|92| A: [Okay .] 
B|93| B: [Um [, [I] [,] [I] [,] I] think] [we] _pay_ [too] [much] [. And] [I've] [, _I] look at_ [my] paycheck _and [I_ make] [, well ,] let's see . They [take] [out] _in state_ [and] federal _taxes_ 
A|94| A: [And] Spanish [is] , [pretty] close [to] English [, really .] 
B|95| B: [But] [I don't] [know] [much] [about] camping [in] Texas . 
A|96| A: Which [is] exactly [what] businesses [do] [at] [the] present . 
B|97| B: [Oh [,] really .] 
A|98| A: [Uh-huh .] The [taxes] [that] people [don't] [think] [about that [,] yeah [,] the] [, the] [, the] income tax [is] [a lot] [more] visible portion [of the] [taxes] [you] [pay [,] I guess] . 
B|99| B: [Oh ,] [how] _fun_ . 
A|100| A: [Huh .] [You] learn _something_ _every_ day . 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|102| A: Everyday ? 
B|103| B: [That's] [what] [I've] heard . 
A|104| A: [Right .] [Yeah ,] [my] father [was] telling [me] [about] some program _he_ read [about where] [you] _buy_ your bags [, like] [you] _buy_ your garbage bag _from the_ city , 
B|105| B: [Oh] wow . 
A|106| A: [That's] great . 
B|107| B: [Uh ,] _just , uh [,_ the] distance involved [and ,] 
A|108| A: [Well , yeah [,] it] keeps [, uh [,] well [,] it's] [doing] real [well [,] because] [when we] got [this] _place_ [the] [, the] dirt [was] [just] overgrazed 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [Right .] Just [get] [you] [away _from] the_ everyday [things that] [are] [going] [on] [. We [,] when] [the] [children] were smaller [we] used [to] [go] [to , uh ,] Delaware along [the] ocean most _every_ [year] [. And] [that was] [fun] [we] stayed mostly [in state] parks [and , uh [,] we] [really] enjoyed [that] . 
B|111| B: _I mean [, [I_ ,] I] [have] [a] [friend] who , _if she_ likes [something] , isn't sure [what] size _somebody_ _might_ need , will [buy] [it] [in] [every] color [and] size [and [,] you know ,] [take] everything back again 
A|112| A: [It] [really] [is] . 
B|113| B: [Well ,] [what] [about , uh ,] papyrus [, you know ,] [made] [out of] [you know ,] bamboo [stuff] [, from the [from] the] banks [of the] Nile . 
A|114| A: [I mean] [I don't] [like] guns [in] general [but] [when [I] think] [about , uh ,] [this] topic [like] capital punishment [I look at] [somebody] [, [I mean ,] I] [just] remember [when I] [was] [in] [college _in] a_ dorm [and [I] think] [if] he'd been around [one] [of] [my] _family_ members probably [would] [have] killed him [but] [in] Florida , [in] [the] [state] [of] Washington [when] they had [the] Ted Bundy case 
B|115| B: [Well [,] is] [the] pollution [really] bad [up] [there] ?

A|124| A: That [was] [a] dead giveaway , huh ? 
B|125| B: My community [, that's] cute [. I] live [in a] [place] called Dye Mound . 
A|126| A: [That's] large [if] your kids aren't [at home] any [more] . 
B|127| B: [So] [don't] [say] she's small , [just say] she's perfect . 
A|128| A: 'cause [if she] fell [in] [then] [I'd] [of] been , had [to] [go] [in] [after] _her [._ And] [up] [here] [the] water's probably [about] forty degrees _right now_ . 
B|129| B: [Um] . 
A|130| A: [Yeah .] 
B|131| B: [Yeah [,] I'm] [kind of] [, I'm] [kind of] bad [about] [it .] 
A|132| A: [Yes ,] _now_ [we] [have] watched some [things] [on that] . 
B|133| B: [And] [he] spends [, well ,] [right now] , he's down [to] [like] once [a] week [, but] [he] [was] [going] over [there] [several] times [a] week [to] [be] [with] [the] [family] [, and] help [them] [with] [the] language . 
A|134| A: [I mean , I] hate [it] 
B|135| B: [Oh [,] that] sounds [so] easy , [what] [I] did , 
A|136| A: [Yeah .] 
B|137| B: [and] [he] [just] shot [them] himself [and] [her .] 
A|138| A: [It] gives [you] confidence [. In] [my] [business] [if] [I] call [on the] [the] J C Penney [company] [here] [in] Dallas or [say] someone [say] Sears [and] Roebuck [in] Chicago , [then I] wear coat [and] tie .
