B|45| B: Right . When [you're] saying [as far as the] appeal [, uh ,] procedure [was] concerned . 
A|46| A: [Okay] , thanks . 
B|47| B: [But ,] [what] happens [is] [we] [used to] fight [a] lot _, so_ [there's] never [much] [of] [a] family family thing [. You know ,] one [of] those hell family vacations . 
A|48| A: [They] [are] [a] handful . 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .]

B|51| B: [Yeah _.] [I_ don't] [take] [much] more [in] [myself] . 
A|52| A: Oh , [really] . 
B|53| B: [Yeah [,] it] [is .] It [really] [is .] 
A|54| A: [Well ,] Nola [I have] enjoyed [talking] [with] [you] thoroughly . This [is] [really] going [to be] [fun] _I think ,_ 
B|55| B: [I] [really] [believe] [that _.] And_ [it] has [, um ,] helped us [to] afford [some] things [for] _our_ children [that] [we] couldn't otherwise [that] [I think] [are] wonderful particularly [at] _this_ _age_ [, and] [I think] _our_ kids [are] real secure _. And_ _have a_ real sense [of] priorities [and] [that] [they] can [do] [anything] [and] [be] [anything] both male [and] female [a] lot 
A|56| A: [Yeah [.] You] put [in [,] um] 
B|57| B: Hello _I [was_ [,] _I] was_ thinking [about] _our_ topic [for] [the] night Um , immigration [problems] _. We_ [have] immigration [problems] [and] [what] [do] , [do] [you] [think] [about] [it] ? 
A|58| A: Oh . 
B|59| B: [But] [I'm not] [sure] [that] [it's] such [a] massive improvement _. Uh [,_ you know ,] once [you] [get] passed thirty-three megahertz , [all] help [is] , _kind of_ lost [in [the] ,] [in the] translation . Because [you] _no_ longer can _think that_ fast anyway . 
A|60| A: [and] [we've [,] we have] [been] [to] Whistler [in] Canada , which [is] [just] [a] marvelous place , Whistler [and] Black Home [is] [in] Canada [, and] _then_ [we've] gone [to] Sun Valley several times , [that's] [a] [, just] [a great] place _. But_ [no] [not] [in] Colorado since [I was] [in] college , since [I] went [to] school , 
B|61| B: Right . Then [you] can [just] [sort of] [have] pictures [to] _go_ along [with] [it] [or something] [, because] [really] , I've thought lately , [there's] nothing new [in the] TIME MAGAZINE . 
A|62| A: Oh , [really] . 
B|63| B: [And] sometimes [I , I] want [to] plant [something] , [there's] [not] enough room [to] plant . Some [of] those things [like [,] uh , you know [,] the] things [that] vine [like [,] uh ,] cucumbers , [or] [, uh ,] squash [or something] [, like that .] Plant one [of] those 
A|64| A: [If] [I] eat [very] [much] sugar , boy [, just] [does] [something] . 
B|65| B: [I don't] _, I don't_ [think] [they] should [be] forced , but [I think] [they] should [be] [, I] guess , encouraged [to] , [to] [do] [some] _kind of_ [public] work [, I] guess [to] [, just] [to] [get] [them] [, I] guess involved [with] community maybe [, you know [,] just] community activity [. If] nothing else [, see] _how_ [the] city works , [stuff] [like that .] 
A|66| A: [I [have] a] thirteen year [old] daughter [and] [so] [we] [go] bike riding [and] [it's] nice [. We] [get] [to] spend [some] [time together] rather [than] [I] [go] [to] [the] gym while she [does] her homework . 
B|67| B: [Yeah .] 
A|68| A: [But] [what] _, [I think_ _that] was a_ _, a_ _, a_ setback . That [they] [, I don't know ,] [they] went [, I don't know ,] [how] [many] miles _an_ hour [. [I] think] [like] 
B|69| B: [I] [know [,] we] wondered [about that [.] But [,] uh _,] oh_ [that was a] traumatic experience [for] us [too] . 
A|70| A: That's where [the] speed [helps] _out_ . 
B|71| B: It should [be] [, [I think] [,] a] flat percentage [and [,] uh [,] that] percentage ought [to be] [an] equitable amount . 
A|72| A: [Well [,] I] [used to] make [the] regular pudding [, the] chocolate [and] put [it] [in the] pie shell [and] _if_ _it would_ sit [in the] refrigerator [for] [a] day , where [you] cut [the] pie [, _it] would_ soak into [the] pie shell [and] [it was] [like] red [, [and] I'm] [like [,] oh] , [this] [is] [kind of] groedy . 
B|73| B: _Uh ,_ yes [, I] am . [I'm] working [in the] computer science department here [uh ,] [at] C M U . 
A|74| A: [Yeah .] 
B|75| B: [and] let's face [it ,] [what] [do] [they] [get] paid . 
A|76| A: [Well [,] [I] [have] the] three girls [and] _then_ [we] ended [up] [with] four grandsons . 
B|77| B: [Well ,] but [it [,] then] [they] can [have] [them] play against each [other] . 
A|78| A: [Uh-huh] , 
B|79| B: [I don't know] . 
A|80| A: [that's] [very] true [. Uh ,] [other] [than] [that [, uh ,] I don't know ,] 
B|81| B: [And] she'd [just] lay there [on] [that] step [and] [just] [, you know ,] cool [off] 
A|82| A: [would] [, _it] would_ [not] [have] [been] [a] good idea [to] had [them] [then] . 
B|83| B: [I] [see] him [out] there , 
A|84| A: They're [all] my parents [age] [. [And] , uh , so] he's got [, you know ,] his retirement though [is] [really] twenty-four hours [a] day [. They [have] a] day care two days [a] week [. They] call [it] senior citizen day care [. But] she goes [in the] senior citizen center . 
B|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: Yes [and ,] 
B|87| B: [But] [it would] [still] [probably] [be] cheaper [with] [the] company helping , _our_ [if] everybody [, you know ,] pulled [their] own weight [in] _it ._ 
A|88| A: [our] mothers [used to] [use] [it [.] And] [then] ,
