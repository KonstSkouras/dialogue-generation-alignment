B|41| B: _I don't know_ [a] judge might [be] [a] little _more_ cold-blooded _about it_ . 
A|42| A: Whoops 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: Right . Some _people [,_ I] mean , families seem [to] migrate towards _one _,_ one_ room [and] carry [on] most [of] _their_ activities _there _,_ and , uh [,_ uh , some] rooms [, [we] have] [one] room [that] [we] never use . 
A|46| A: [Okay] _. We_ [don't] [start] [anything] indoors _we [,_ just] wait until [, you know [,] the] weather warm _enough to_ stick [it] _in the_ ground . 
B|47| B: [Yeah [.] We] [all] went [to] high _school_ together _and _, uh ,_ and_ we're still [in] contact [with] each _other_ . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [Oh [,] well _,] I guess_ , retirement _, that_ _kind of_ [thing] which [I don't] worry _much_ [about] [so] 
A|50| A: Brian [in] Plano , Texas . _How_ [are] [you] doing today ? 
B|51| B: [they] [don't] [get out] _of the_ house [, they] [don't] socialize but [it's] [my] home _and [I_ don't] _want to_ leave [it] . 
A|52| A: [Uh _,] we've_ _got_ plenty , [in] fact _, we've_ _got_ [far] [too] many . You're [in] [, uh _,] what_ Flower Mound ? 
B|53| B: [How] [about] [you] _, do [you_ have] _any_ _children_ ? 
A|54| A: [and] _it is_ hard [to] [make] [, uh ,] those interests [not] [be] _as_ [a] major part [of] [my] life . 
B|55| B: Is [that] _right_ ? 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: [So , uh ,] but [, uh ,] 
A|58| A: [And I] [just] , [there [,] you know [,] they] came _from_ poverty [, they were] [going to] condition [in] poverty [and] _it was_ _, it was_ [, the] [school] district couldn't hire many [people _,] it was_ very difficult _for_ _them to_ hire _, and I think_ [, you know ,] _in the_ sense [, that] aspect [of] public service _for_ education [in] [some] [of the] inner cities _for [,_ um [,] just] social workers [in] [some] [of the] inner cities [and] [some] [of the] rural areas _where_ [they] [just] need advice [on] medical [, um ,] _things _,_ _I think_ [it's_ a] [really] good [idea] [. And] even [if] _it is_ overseas . 
B|59| B: judge 
A|60| A: _Well , I_ [just] wanted [it] [because] , again [, I] _had_ [, I guess] traditionally always _had_ [a] car [that] _had_ [one] [and I] thought [it] [would] [be] [more] reliable . 
B|61| B: [Yeah .] 
A|62| A: _And ,_ course [, that's] [kind of] [like] [a] cancer [in] [an] apartment complex [. You] [start] letting _that happen_ [and they] [go] down [and] then [before] [you know it] [you have] drugs [and a lot] [of] [other] [things] _so [,_ uh _,] I'm_ sure [that] aggravates [it] also . 
B|63| B: [Yeah .] [I don't] _think _that_ [,_ some] [people] [I don't] [think] _have [,_ uh ,] [a] year [in] [them to] volunteer [if [you] know] _what I_ mean . They're [not] worth [it] 
A|64| A: She _lives_ [in] Garland [and] _I'm not_ sure _where_ _, what_ she [does] . But she's [, uh _,] oh_ she's very heavy [in] [that] [and] she takes her own [bags] [to] [the] grocery store 
B|65| B: [And] [we [,] _the] [,_ the] principal feature [I] [like] [about] ours [is] [that] [it's] pier [and] beam . 
A|66| A: But [, uh ,] [right] now our neighborhood [is] running [about] [, uh ,] eighty percent [of the] homeowners [have] _been_ robbed , sometime during _their ,_ _their , uh ,_ existence [in] [that] neighborhood . 
B|67| B: It's [a] whole new , [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [And] [you] also [get [a] lot] [of] [, uh ,] juries [are] extremely [, uh , and] _from_ [what I] hear _, I , [I_ [have] [,] [I] have] [some] _friends_ _who do_ expert witness testimony [and they] _say_ _that , uh ,_ juries [are] extremely vulnerable [to [,] uh ,] sort [of] emotional pitches [, you know [,] the] prosecutor will [want [to] _,] oh _,_ I don't know_ show [the ,] show [the] mugging victim [, you know ,] show [what] [the] _nice_ person he _was_ [and] [what] [a] _family_ life [, and] basically [get] [the] _jury_ [to be] very sympathetic _with the_ victim [, and , uh ,] _or_ , _or_ _, uh , if_ [it's a] corporation [, that] _was_ [, uh [,] you know ,] harming [some] individual _or_ something _like that [,_ they] [get] very [much] [, well [,] you know _,] it's_ [just] [a] big faceless corporation . Let's , let's [make] [them] pay _as_ [much] _as_ possible . Things [like that .] 
B|69| B: Surely , there's [and] end [to [,] the] situation . 
A|70| A: My goodness 
B|71| B: [and ,] 
A|72| A: _yeah ._ 
B|73| B: [Well [,] [it] [,] [it] [is] [,] [it] [,] you know ,] [on the] [other] hand [you] , you've [got] [, uh ,] you've [got] [the [,] uh [,] the] possibility [of] [people [,] oh ,] you've [got] [some] [people] could [be] arrested [for [,] uh ,] drug use , drug dealings [and things [like that] [,] and [, uh ,] if] [their [,] if] [their] employers name hits [the] papers [and] [that] [it's] [, it's] [, [it's] a] mark against [them] , 
A|74| A: [and [,] you know ,] various [other] _things ,_ Raised [it up] . 
B|75| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [You] [know [,] we've] advanced beyond [that [,] and _I think] that_ [their , uh ,] mentality [as] [far] [as] [the] way [they] treat [them] [and] [that] [kind of] [thing] [, you know] [what I] mean . 
A|78| A: [Oh] . 
B|79| B: but [there] [are] others [in the] [family] [who do] [them] better . 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh _.] Well [,_ [do] [,] do you] [think] [that's] good _or_ bad ? 
B|81| B: Wow . 
A|82| A: [Well ,] these [are] accidental tomatos . 
B|83| B: [And [I] think it's] [kind of] neat [to be] able [to] spend [the] afternoons [with the] [kids] occasionally [too] . 
A|84| A: [Well] [my] husband [is] telling me [we [have] to] hit [the] road We're [going [to] [go] to] Commerce [and] see [a] friend [. _And] ,_ then _I'm_ [going [to] [go] to] Sulphur Springs . 
B|85| B: [Yeah [.] Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [I] can't remember which . _I was_ [on] [a] [jury] trial last year only [I] [got] kicked [out] [as] [, uh [,] the] last selection [that] [the [,] uh ,] defense [got] . 
A|88| A: The story [of] [my] life 
B|89| B: [And ,] [so [,] if] [they] penalize businesses , business [people] [are] smart [enough to] _say ,_ here's [my] break point [, [I'm] not] [going to] work _any_ harder [and] [make] _any_ [more] [or] create _any_ [more] jobs . 
A|90| A: [Yeah .] 
B|91| B: [Yeah .] 
A|92| A: [I think that] once [you] [do] [that [,] your] [children] [kind of] develop [the] same attitudes . At _least_ [my] daughters [have] _. They_ [try to] teach theirs [not] [to] [get] [into] [things] instead [of] having [to] put everything [up] . [So] [it's] worked pretty [well] . There's _, I don't_ [really] [think] anything's _been_ broken . Every now [and] then [we [have] to] [kind of] [go] [and] [say ,] now [don't] bother _this_ [you know] . 
B|93| B: [that [,] that's] [really] sad [, you know [,] you] [got] [young] [boys] [or] girls [, that] at fourteen [or] twelve years old [that] [are] committing murders [and ,] no remorse [, what] [so] ever . 
A|94| A: [You] [think] [about it] [and it's] [really _,] I don't know_ . This _country_ [kind of] takes [the] worst care [of the] elderly [of] [any] [other] _country_ . 
B|95| B: [Well [,] it was] [nice] [to] [talk] [to] [you] . [I know] they've started over [in] Richardson [where] [my] dad [lives] [. They] pick [up] newspapers [, I think] . 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [it was] litter trained 
A|98| A: [Yeah _,] probably_ [, [I] was] allergic [to] dogs when [I was] [a kid] , [in] fact , 
B|99| B: [It] [does] [a] few [more] [things [,] uh ,] than [had] [been] available [before] . 
A|100| A: Static [here .] 
B|101| B: its reliability . 
A|102| A: [And] Lord knows [what] happened [to] him . He's _probably_ [been] through [all] kinds [of] nightmares . 
B|103| B: [I , I] [like] [the] [idea] [that [, uh ,] if] someone [is] [from] [a] foreign [country] [, [and] they] come [to] [this] [country] [and] [uh ,] commit , [a] crime [, [I think] that] irregardless [of] whether [they have] already become [a] citizen [or] [anything] [, they] should [be] immediately deported . 
A|104| A: [And] [that [,] I] [had] two internal [, [one] [,] yeah ,] two internal plane flights [and a] couple [of] [other] [things] . [It] [was] [really ,] 
B|105| B: Right . [Yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: That's [right] 
A|108| A: [It] goes [from] hot [, and] then [you] [get a] couple [of] weeks [of] [that] Indian Summer [, and] then [it's] cold 
B|109| B: [Yeah . [Well [,] I] [, I] don't know] how [that] [would] ever [happen] [here] but at [least] [, um ,] 
B|110| B: [if] [your] [friends] [or] [family] [got] [, uh ,] [had] [that happen] [to] [them] [I think] everyone [would] [, I ,] they'd [, probably] pull [the] trigger themselves [or] flip [the] switch themselves [and] [with] [a] smile [on] [their] face , [as] [they] did [it] .
