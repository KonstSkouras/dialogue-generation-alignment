A|0| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|1| B: _I think_ _so_ . 
A|2| A: _And_ _it's a_ game _that_ none _of_ _their_ friends _know how_ _to_ play _, and_ _they_ both enjoy _it_ _. So_ _if they_ want _to_ play _, they_ _have to_ play _with_ mom _and_ dad . 
B|3| B: _Yes _,_ oh ,_ yes . [to] child _in_ _No _,_ I'm_ busy _right_ _now_ , Steven . Steven wants _me_ _to do_ popcorn _right_ _now_ . 
A|4| A: _I don't_ _really_ _see_ _the_ emphasis _on_ _things like_ Peace Corps _, like_ _we_ _, you know _,_ we_ saw _back_ _, I_ guess _, in the_ Carter administration , 
B|5| B: _Yeah _,_ well _,_ of course_ _in _the _,_ uh _,_ I_ think_ [you] _probably_ noticed [in the] discount stores [and] _places_ [, in the] hair sprays _we're not_ seeing _as_ many aerosol cans _down_ here nearly _everything_ _is in the_ pump squirt , 
A|6| A: _Uh-huh ._ Paris _. And_ _my_ cousin lives [in] Paris [and] she's lived _there_ _for_ _like_ [, oh ,] off [and] _on_ _for_ twenty _years_ . 
B|7| B: _Right _,_ well_ [I] didn't realize _my husband_ _was_ such [a] sucker [for] animals until [I] brought _one_ home _one_ night _. We_ [, I] _had_ _one that_ _had [,_ _we] had [,_ _we] had_ [to] put [to] sleep _he_ _got_ _so_ sick . 
A|8| A: _Yes ._ They , 
B|9| B: _Right ._ 
A|10| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: Okay . 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: [I] _would_ love _, I can_ hardly wait _to get_ _up there_ . 
B|15| B: _I was_ born [in] L _A_ _so _I_ know_ _what_ _you're_ _talking_ _about_ . In L _A_ _, it's_ pretty bad . 
A|16| A: [I'm] Catholic [and] [we're not] supposed _to _,_ _but ,_ uh , I_ feel _that _it_ _,_ like_ _you _, you_ know ,_ _on the_ premeditated murders [I] feel _if_ [you're] _, you know [,_ I] mean , _if_ [it's] beyond [a] doubt _that you_ did _it _,_ you know_ [I] _would_ say _go_ _ahead_ [and] execute [that] person [as] [well] . 
B|17| B: _I think_ _so_ _too_ _. I'm_ [in] Texas 
A|18| A: _And [,_ uh _,] the_ green onions _are_ coming along . 
B|19| B: [Uh-huh _.] _Right_ ._ 
A|20| A: [Right _,] _and_ people_ _don't_ _see_ [that] either . 
B|21| B: they're encouraged _to do_ _that ,_ missionary _work [,_ and] [I] _I really_ believe [that] [the] [people] [that] _do_ [that] [are] better [people] [that] _make_ _our_ , society better . 
A|22| A: enjoyed [talking] [to] [you] . 
B|23| B: _That's_ pretty easy substituting _isn't_ _it ?_ 
A|24| A: [Right .] Huh _. _And_ [,_ of course] [, I] doubt _if_ _there's_ _any_ _, you can_ buy regular anymore . You buy unleaded [. Right] ? 
B|25| B: _We_ _just_ [have] [the] case _, _I'm_ , I'm_ sure you've _probably_ heard [of] Marion Berry . 
A|26| A: _But_ [I know] [that] last year [we] did _go to_ [a] baseball game last year [. We] [got] free tickets _because_ someone _at_ [our] church , [one] _of the_ deacons _at_ church , um , parks cars _at_ The Mansion _at_ Turtle Creek which [is] _like_ [one] _of [the_ , uh _,] the_ [places] [and] stuff . 
B|27| B: _Oh_ 
A|28| A: _Uh ,_ 
B|29| B: When [the] days start getting [a] little longer [, you _know [,] you_ _can] [,_ I can] start _doing_ [it] [in the] evening after _work_ . 
A|30| A: Okay _. And_ [so] [we] _could_ [, we] _could_ talk [about] _, uh , that_ path [, you know ,] _how_ important [you] [think] his benefits [are] _. _And_ _, and_ _,_ and , uh ,_ _how_ important [you] [think] _they_ [are] _and _if_ ,_ [what] _would_ [you] _like_ _to see_ increased [in] his benefits . 
B|31| B: _Oh , I_ bet _it doesn't_ mix _well ,_ _does_ _it ?_ 
A|32| A: [Yeah ,] _with_ [, uh ,] _with_ [our] current [, uh ,] organization [, we] [do] _have a_ nice retirement package [and] also [a] _, a_ nice _thing_ [that _,] that_ _we have_ [in] [our] corporation [is] [a] [, uh _,] is_ [a] profit sharing plan where [we] [can [,] uh ,] participate [in _the ,] the_ profits _of _the_ company_ . If [we're] [, you know ,] _if_ we've _been_ _there_ _a while_ [and] [we're] vested [, uh ,] which means [that [,] you know [,] _we] _have_ a_ , an interest [, uh [,] in _the] company_ [that] [we] [can [,] uh ,] _get_ _some_ _of the_ benefits _of [the_ ,] either [the] profit _high_ _times_ _or_ , _or_ [in] [a] sense , suffer during [the] low _times_ 
B|33| B: Jerry Burns . 
A|34| A: _And_ [that] might be [a] partial solution , _or_ _something_ . 
B|35| B: [And , and] _then_ _when_ [we] [go to] sleep [at] night [, you know _,] it's_ [like] _my husband_ [and] [I] [have to] try [to get] [any] space [on the] bed [because] [we have] _all_ _four_ [of] _them_ [up there] [with] _us_ . 
A|36| A: Well , _if_ [you're] looking _for a_ nice , [Uh-huh .] Well [, I] guess _if_ [you] _were_ having , _if_ [you] _were_ trying [to] impress _somebody_ [like] taking _somebody_ _that you_ hadn't seen _for a_ _long_ time [and] wanted [to] show [them] [a] good restaurant . It's [a] special occasion , _type_ _thing ._ 
B|37| B: [Yeah _,] and , uh [, and_ [,] you know [,] uh , I] suppose [, uh ,] _years ago ,_ way [back] _when_ [, uh ,] _when_ [, uh [,] they] _had the_ revolutionary _war_ [and people] decided [that] [they] [, uh ,] [were] fed [up] [with] [the] government _, uh , [and_ [if] they] didn't [have a] way [to [,] uh ,] [to] fight [back] [they] _would have_ [been] [in] big trouble . 
A|38| A: _Oh , yeah ._ 
B|39| B: [and] _well _,_ it_ costs two hundred dollars [for] books [, but] [you know ,] seven hundred dollars [a] semester _, a lot of people_ [can] spare [that] [if they] planned [ahead] [, you know [,] like] 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: [Oh , yeah] _that's_ _about the_ same _kind of_ [thing .] 
A|42| A: _So_ , 
B|43| B: [Oh , yeah .] 
A|44| A: [Oh [, I] think] [it] [is] . 
B|45| B: [and] I've [been] drug tested three [times] [and] [I know] many [people] [that] [have] never [been] tested [in] [their] _lifetime_ [and] [the company] [I] _work_ [for] [is] sixty thousand [people] , plus [. So] [see] _I ,_ [for] [some] reason , I've come [up] three [times] _. That's_ pretty [high] statistics . 
A|46| A: You _don't_ [like] [it ?] 
B|47| B: [Oh ,] [really] . 
A|48| A: [That's] true . 
B|49| B: [Oh] . [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: [I really] [, of course] _, you ,_ [you're] [in] [a] different part _of the_ country [, [I] [,] [I] really] listen [to] [a lot _of] the_ talk shows _, I don't_ mean [the] gossip ones [, but] _there's_ [a lot _of] ,_ [on the] weekends [when] [I] [do] chores , _or_ whatever [, I'm] [a] radio hound [I] guess [, I] take [the] radio [with] [me] [when] [I'm] _working_ _on my_ car _, the_ lawn _or_ whatever [, and] turn [on] [, they] [have] [everything] _from_ lawn [work ,] lawyers , news [, uh ,] veterinarians , [all] kinds [of] items [, uh ,] [so] [I'm , I'm] [a] real radio buff , especially [on the] [when] [I'm] [doing] chores . 
B|51| B: Mine's broke [at] [the] moment [, but] 
A|52| A: [Yes [,] we] [do] . 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: _I see_ 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah [.] And] [are] [they] tested random ? 
A|56| A: Well [well ,] _who_ , _who_ else [is] _going [to_ do] _this_ _, then_ ? 
B|57| B: [Right .] 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] You'd [have [a] lot of] hills _in [that_ ,] [down] _in that_ area . 
B|59| B: [And] _that's_ [really] [a] terrific feeling _, because_ [you] _just_ [go] [there] [at] [the] end [of _the] day_ [, and] [you] figure , God [, I'm] ready [for] bed [and] [you] exercise [and] [then] _, it's_ _sort of_ painful [for [a] while] , 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh .] [probably] [right] , [if] [you] look [at] [it] _from_ [that] stand point . 
B|61| B: [I don't] [know how] _much_ [, and] [I] _had_ her [for] over two _years and_ she _was_ _very_ affectionate . She [would] [, you know ,] crawl [on] [me] [and] she [would] sit [like] [on my] neck [or] [my] shoulder [while] _I was_ [working] [, and] [things like] [that] . [Yeah ,] _much_ more than [you] [would] [think] . 
A|62| A: Well [, [it] doesn't] [make] sense . _Because_ [if they] want [people] [to] convert [, you know] . They _should_ [make] [it] worthwhile . 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|64| A: [so I] [would [have] to] say [that] camping [and] hiking [and] canoeing [and] Boy Scouts [is] [my] hobby . 
B|65| B: _Oh , I see ._ 
A|66| A: Well [, I] [do] , [too] [, I] [do] , [too] [and] [that] [was] [one] [thing] [about the] year around school [that] originally [we had] [been] [sort of] negative [on] [it] _. But_ [then] [we] started thinking , especially [in] Plano _, the_ weather [is] [so] hot [in] August _, that_ [there] [really] [isn't] [a lot] [the] _children_ [can] [do] outside anyhow . 
B|67| B: [Yes .] 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: Lord . 
A|70| A: [Oh , I see [.] That's] fine . _Um [,_ I think] [, uh ,] [that's] pleasurable [for] [all] [of] [us] , [if] [we] choose [the] [right] restaurant 
B|71| B: [But] Washington's [a] great place [to do] [that] . 
A|72| A: [No ,] [my husband] _does ._ 
B|73| B: [And] [there's] no family [there] [, they] [don't] [get] [to see] [their] grandkids [, they] [don't] [get] [to see] [their] [children] [, they] _just_ [there] [in that] house . 
A|74| A: [Yeah .] 
B|75| B: [Oh ,] wow [, I] bet . 
A|76| A: _Um_ . 
B|77| B: [Yes [,] it] certainly [does .] 
A|78| A: Bye-bye . 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: Huh . 
B|81| B: [Yeah .] 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [Yeah [,] [it] ,] [when] [it] comes [on the] manufacturing floor [it's] [about] _ten_ bucks . 
A|84| A: [And] [does] [that] mean [like] flus [and] [everything] else _, there_ [are] [all] these different strains [of] [it ?] 
B|85| B: Probably [, yeah] [Yeah [.] But] [, uh ,] no _, it's_ _, it's_ sad , _though_ [, [that] [,] uh , that] [the] [people] , _though_ [, [that] [you] [, you] ,] somebody's _life_ _is in_ twelve people's hands [and] sometimes those twelve [people] [could] care less . 
A|86| A: [Yes [,] they] will . 
B|87| B: [Right .] There's [, there] , [this] _topic_ [is] _kind of_ mute . [Uh] 
A|88| A: Huh ? 
B|89| B: [Yes ,] uh-huh . 
A|90| A: [Yeah [.] That's] [right] [. I'm] [not] limited [to ,] [just] mowing [it] [on] Saturday morning [, you know ,] 
B|91| B: [Uh ,] other than [that it] [was] [a] [at] best . 
A|92| A: [all] , always [right] , [right] before [the] news [is] [when] [I] catch [them] . [I [,] I] tend [to ,] [if] nothing else [is in the] town television [at] eleven o'clock [just] [to] _watch_ [the] news [, and] [or] , [or] NIGHTLINE [or] _something_ , [just] [sort of] [get] [a] good [, you know [,] a] good [, a] good [think] [for] [the day] . 
B|93| B: [I'm] [going to] switch [from] those yellow legal pads [, then] . 
A|94| A: [Uh [,] a lot of people] [really] [doesn't] [think] [that] [much] [about] [it [,] because] [it] hasn't happened [to] [them] , which [it] hasn't [to] [me] either [, you know] ? 
B|95| B: [Yeah ,] 
A|96| A: [it doesn't] matter _who_ [it] [is] [and] [they] _keep_ everyone else away [from] [you] . 
B|97| B: [Because] [you] [got] [to ,] [watch] [them] _every_ [day] [, and] [keep] [them] watered 
A|98| A: [No] . 
B|99| B: [Oh , I] wasn't [there] [too] _long ago_ . [Uh] . 
A|100| A: [Yeah ,] [he] makes good money [too] [doing] [that ,] you'd be [I was] shocked [, but] anyway , someone gave an Iranian [a] tip [of] [four] Rangers tickets last year , 
B|101| B: [Yeah .] 
A|102| A: [A] train [of] cats running around . 
B|103| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
A|104| A: Okay [, well _,] there's_ [, uh [,] it's] [kind of] an interesting [topic] [and] [one that] [I think] [is] _quite_ fascinating [because] [, uh ,] couple [of] [years ago [,] I] guess [, uh ,] [not] [very] , [not] [very] [long [ago] ,] seemed [like] [the] whole world , [not] [just] [the] United States [, but] [the] whole world [was] [kind of] [in] [a] standstill where everyone [was] basically [in] [, uh [,] you know [,] a] [very] comfortable position , [so] [to] say , even [though] _the , the_ cold [war] _was , was_ [in] full swing . You [know , you] [had _the] , the_ Russians against [the] Americans _, the_ Communists against [the] Free World [, and] [in the] last couple [of] [years] [things] [have] changed dramatically , [not] only [on the] political front [but] also [on the] economic front , where [, uh ,] couple [of] [years ago] [we had [,] uh ,] America [was] [one] [of the] leading powers [and] [one] [of the] strongest nations [in the] world [as] far [as] economics [were] concerned [, and] [now] [we're] having [a] [very] tough time [in] [a] recessionary period . We're also [have a] [very] humongous trade deficit [, and , uh , and] [that's] [kind of] frightening . Also [, you know [,] a] couple [of] [years ago ,] [ten] , fifteen , [ten] , fifteen [years ago ,] an individual [going] into [a] career [could] expect [to] [have] [that] career basically throughout [their] whole [life] [, and] thirty [years ago [,] that] _was [,_ that] [was] basically [it ,] whereas [now] [we're] expected [to] [have a] career change [every] [, you know ,] [every] couple [of] [years and] possibly [four] [to] five career changes throughout [our] [lifetime] [, and] [so [I] think] [, uh [,] you know ,] [things] _, there's_ [been] an awful [lot of] social change lately [, and] [and , uh] . 
B|105| B: [Um [,] you know [,] it] may prevent [somebody] [who] [was , was] teetering [on the] edge [of] experimenting [or] whatnot [but , uh [, I] don't] [know] [if [,] you know [,] [the] [,] it's] [, [it's] a] needs [of the] few [and] [the] needs [of the] many [type] situation [I don't] [know] [if] everybody [should] [have to] sacrifice [quite] [as] [much] . There [, there's] still [a] big question [in] [my] mind [that [,] [the] , the] absolute refusal [to] accept [the] possibility [of [,] of] mistakes [on the] testing [, is] [something] [that] still bothers [me] . 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [Uh [,] but ,] 
A|108| A: [Yes .] 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [No] thanks [. That's] [right] . 
B|111| B: [Oh] . 
A|112| A: [Oh ,] [that's] good . 
B|113| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|114| A: [Yeah .]

You know , you had the , the Russians against the Americans , the Communists against the Free World , and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically , not only on the political front but also on the economic front , where , uh , couple of years ago we had , uh , America was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned , and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period .
