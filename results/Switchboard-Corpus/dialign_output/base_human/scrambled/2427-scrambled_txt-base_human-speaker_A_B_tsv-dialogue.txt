A|0| A: _Uh ,_ _got_ _kids_ ? 
B|1| B: Anyway _, I_ dealt _with_ _two_ _or_ _three_ [kids] today _that are_ _going to_ _end up_ _where_ _somebody_ _has_ , making _a_ _decision_ _what_ _to do _with_ them_ . 
A|2| A: _So _I_ like_ Gordon Lightfoot _, do _you_ know_ _who_ _he_ _is_ ? 
B|3| B: _The_ _the_ _one_ week _uh_ _seven_ _day_ _the_ delay 
A|4| A: _Oh _,_ they_ _really_ didn't propose _any_ solutions . Actually _, they_ were _, the_ _guy_ _was_ _pretty_ negative _about_ _the things that_ [the] government _was_ _doing_ _even_ though _he_ _was_ _from the_ _E_ P A . 
B|5| B: [Uh [,] do you] _mean_ businesses [from _the] point of_ view _as_ , _of ,_ _of_ selling _things to_ _a_ consumer _and then_ being responsible _for the_ sales tax ? Or purchasing . 
A|6| A: _but_ _it_ doesn't _really_ feel _like_ _you're_ _in the_ country . 
B|7| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| A: _Oh _,_ that's_ _great_ . 
B|9| B: _Okay ._ 
A|10| A: _No_ . 
B|11| B: _Well _,_ I'm_ [like] _you _._ _I_ _don't , _I_ don't_ _, I_ like_ _to_ _read_ [the] paper [but] [I] basically _don't _do_ it_ every _day_ _, and I _,_ um , I_ usually watch _, uh ,_ either GOOD MORNING , AMERICA _or the_ TODAY SHOW , every morning _while_ _I'm , you know ,_ 
A|12| A: _Okay [,_ uh _,] what_ _kind of_ hobbies [do you] _have_ Lori ? 
B|13| B: _Uh-huh _._ Um_ _, I_ _see_ . 
A|14| A: _I'll_ _be_ darned . 
B|15| B: _Right_ , _Right _._ Uh-huh ._ 
A|16| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: [Uh ,] 
A|18| A: _I think _,_ _I _,_ I_ ,_ _now_ _I think_ _people_ generally volunteer . 
B|19| B: _and _,_ _see_ _,_ I'm_ _afraid_ _I think if_ _we_ _would_ _take the_ equivalent amount [of] _money_ _and_ invest _it in_ young _people _,_ _that ,_ _I_ mean ,_ course _, _you_ couldn't_ _do that_ _because_ [you] [got] _to do something_ _with _the_ ones_ _that are_ _already_ _there_ 
A|20| A: [Yeah .] 
B|21| B: [Oh ,] gosh . 
A|22| A: [I] keep hoping [for] . 
B|23| B: [Yeah _.] And_ _the , the_ laws _are_ _all [,_ the] rules . Some _of [the_ things _that] would_ _make_ sense _to _,_ to_ _tell_ [the] jury _, that_ _this _,_ _this_ guy_ _has_ _a _,_ a_ prior criminal history _, you know _,_ where_ _he's_ raped ten women 
A|24| A: _but [,_ uh ,] 
B|25| B: [Uh ,] uh-huh _. Uh-huh ._ 
A|26| A: [and I] understand [that] [the] jails [are] full [of] _people , you know [,_ uh] [and] _that they_ _have [to_ do something] . 
B|27| B: [I] asked myself . 
A|28| A: _They_ expect , opening [it] [for] [one] hour [, that] they'll _get_ [three] , _hundred_ thousand telephone calls . 
B|29| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|30| A: [Yeah _.] [Well_ _,] _we_ used [to_ _,] we_ [don't] _as much_ anymore _, _but_ _,_ uh , _we_ used to_ _. We_ _kind of_ slowed _down_ _a little_ bit _. But _, uh ,_ I think_ [the] worst [, the] worst _thing_ _is_ _when_ _it's_ raining . If [you] _get a_ rainy season [and] [you] happen _to be_ camping _then it_ _can be_ _kind of_ _bad_ . 
B|31| B: _And_ _so_ _she_ _works_ _a lot of_ evenings [and] weekends _and so_ _two_ days [a] week [, I [,] uh ,] manage [to] [get] _home_ early _enough_ [to] meet [the] [kids] _on the_ bus [So] _she_ [you know ,] _goes_ [in] early _those_ days [and] _works_ [like] [, you know ,] noon til _close_ _. Uh _,_ so we have_ 
A|32| A: [Well _,] he_ _could_ _always_ [get] _past_ [, you know ,] he'd [get] _past_ [like] six [or] [seven] tackles [and] _just_ keep spinning _around_ [and] [get] [on] _into_ [the] [end] zone _. But [,_ um _, I] guess_ [you] _never_ _could_ _really_ [see] him _play_ , [because] [with the] Cowboys , [while] _he_ _was_ [with the] _team_ [, the] _rest_ [of the] _team_ _was_ _pretty_ poor [so] [you couldn't] _really_ [tell] [if] _it _was_ just_ him [or the] _team_ [and I] _always_ _just_ assumed [that] _he_ _was_ _too_ _good_ [for the] _rest_ [of the] _team_ _. But _,_ I don't know ._ 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
A|36| A: _That's_ _right _._ That's_ _right [._ [Uh-huh .] Uh-huh .] Takes [a lot of] room . 
B|37| B: _Yeah . Right ._ 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: My [kids] [are] involved [in] sports . My daughter [has] played _basketball_ [for] six _years [,_ and] _my_ son plays football _. I _,_ my_ rule _is_ _that they_ _can't_ _play_ [a] sport _the same_ _time_ [of the] _year_ [because] _there's_ _just_ _not_ [enough] [of] _me to_ drive [them] _around_ everywhere . 
B|41| B: Taxes . 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [They] [really] _do _._ I , I_ _sometimes_ _think that_ [that] _should be_ limited _more_ . 
A|44| A: [and] [you] _can_ _just_ [see] [the things that] _they're_ _trying to_ show [with] music . 
B|45| B: _Oh , really_ ? 
A|46| A: [Oh _,] yeah ._ 
B|47| B: _Huh-uh ._ 
A|48| A: [And] _it , it_ takes [a lot of] _care_ [like] twenty-four _hours_ [a] [day] someone , [has] _to be_ , [Well _,] there's_ someone [in] _my_ _, my_ fiancee's _family_ . 
B|49| B: [Yeah] _, it's_ cheaper [for] [me to] buy insurance _by_ [the] month _than_ [to] _work_ staff someplace . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [Yeah .] 
A|52| A: [it] _when_ [it's] [uh] [it's] _an_ emotional issue [, and] [you] sit [and] [you] try [and] [think] _about_ [it] logically [and] [and] [and] [you know] [you] try [to] say [to] _yourself_ _now_ emotionally [this] _is a_ disgusting _thing_ [, uh] [but] logically [um] _even_ [you know] [for] instance [, the] pro _life_ pro choice movement [, uh] [you know] _I don't know_ anybody [that] _actually_ supports abortion _, but_ _they_ [would] vote pro choice . 
B|53| B: _and it's_ _very_ _hard_ [for] [me] [because] [, you know _,] it's_ [like] [you] grow _up_ [to be] twenty [years] old [, _and] it's_ _always [the_ same] man 
A|54| A: bit . Tell [me] _how_ yours [works] _. [Well_ ,] _at_ [the] [I] introduced [you] _a little_ bit [to] _it [,_ _a] few_ minutes _ago ,_ _when_ _I said_ [that] _we _are_ , uh ,_ we're [on the] east coast _now ._ 
B|55| B: [Yeah] , haven't either . 
A|56| A: _We_ spent _too_ _much_ _money ,_ until our children _went_ [to] college [, so] _. So ,_ [tell] [me] _about ,_ 
B|57| B: _here_ [you] break _in [,_ and] _you're going to_ [get] shot . 
A|58| A: _But [,_ um , I] personally am [for the] _trying_ [it] _at home_ caretaker _part_ _before_ [I think] I'd ever , 
B|59| B: Ri- , _Exactly ._ 
A|60| A: [Oh ,] _good ._ 
B|61| B: Some beet [, uh ,] potatoes 
A|62| A: [and _,] um , there's_ children [in] _her_ classroom [that] _just_ totally disrupt [the] classroom [, where] [the] teacher cannot teach 
B|63| B: [And] she's _lived_ [with] _us_ [for] [like] five [years] [. [So] I] [kind of] [know] [how] _it is_ [to ,] [how] [to] decide [if] [you] _want _to_ put_ _somebody_ [in] [a] [rest] [home] [or] [, um _,] like_ _we [,_ _I] mean_ _we've_ _had_ _those_ discussions [, you know ,] [about] _should_ [we] _put_ [her] [in] [or] [because] she's [pretty] senile [and] 
A|64| A: _And they_ didn't _used [to_ be] _actually _,_ but_ _they_ [got] [kind of] wild [and] weren't _doing_ [very] _well_ _inside_ [, so] [I] [put] [them] outside once _I got_ [a] house [and] _they're_ _doing_ _great_ _out_ _there _,_ they_ love _it _._ But_ [the] other [one] [, the] first [one] _I got_ _he_ doesn't [want] anything [to do with] outside unless [you're] [there] . 
B|65| B: [And] _we got_ [, uh [,] the] [one] [that] [my] parents [have] [is] [an] Apple Two [E] . 
A|66| A: _yeah_ [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [Oh ,] [how] _wonderful_ . 
A|68| A: [Right .] 
B|69| B: [I got] [to] wait [for] [a] _place_ [to _,] [to_ _,] to_ free _up ._ 
A|70| A: Other [than] [that] _he_ _gets_ scared [to] death . If [you] shut [that] door _he_ [goes] _into_ hiding . 
B|71| B: [and] _oh [,_ my] husband [just] died . 
A|72| A: [Oh _,] yeah ,_ I'd [do _it] ,_ I'd use [it] [for] both . [The] _nice_ _thing_ [about] autocrossing [is] [you] _can_ [, you] _can_ [do] both . 
B|73| B: [Oh] [well] [he] _lived_ _through_ [it _,] oh [,_ I] [couldn't] _believe_ [it [.] We] [went] _through_ [like] twenty-two [hundred] dollars worth [of] vet _bills_ . 
A|74| A: [Okay] [I] wasn't _sure_ . Most [of [the] ones] [, you know ,] [up] north [and] everything [do] _, _but_ [,_ um ,] anyway [, _it's] [,_ uh [,] _it's] pretty_ , also [pretty] typical [for the] area . Most [of] [this] area _was_ developed [, this] house _was_ built [in] seventy-four . 
B|75| B: [Yeah] _, so , uh ,_ 
A|76| A: [Yeah [.] Uh _,] they_ [do that] [I think if] [you're] [, uh ,] research [here] _then _I_ know_ [of] some [of the] _people that_ [have] gotten _their_ masters [and _I] think [that_ [,] um _,] they_ _might [, you_ know ,] _pay_ _for _that_ ._ Pay [for the] classes [and] _stuff_ 
B|77| B: Something , 
A|78| A: _I think that's _a_ lot more_ realistic _. Uh [, [I_ _,] _I] think_ that_ [we] [should be] spending [more] _time_ [and [,] and] _again_ [I don't] [think] [the , the] Peace Corps [is] , [is] [as] successful _now_ simply [because] _it's not_ . It doesn't fit [the] circumstance anymore . 
B|79| B: [Yeah] [, I guess] [the] _problem_ [with] plastic [is] [there's] [so] many different kinds [that] [you] [can't] recycle [, you] [can't] [just] throw _all_ plastic [into] [one] recycler . 
A|80| A: [Right .] 
B|81| B: _And , uh ,_ although usually [the] guys _that are_ turning themselves [in] [are ,] [are] guys _that [are_ [,] you know] _going to_ [get] caught anyways [but ,] There's [always] [a few] [of] _those_ [people _that] [are_ [,] you know ,] lost [their] head _or whatever_ . 
A|82| A: _That's_ _, yeah ,_ 
B|83| B: Because [I] finally asked [because] [, you know [,] we] _had_ _all_ [of] _those_ milk cartons [and] [there] [was] nowhere _else_ _to take_ _them and_ _they had_ _it in_ front [of] Wal-Mart [and I] ask [in] Wal-Mart [and] [they] [said] [they] moved [it] [just] behind . 
A|84| A: [Oh ,] [is] [that] _right ?_ [Okay .] 
B|85| B: [Yeah] [, that's] true . 
A|86| A: _and , uh [,_ so we have] watched [that] 
B|87| B: [But] [that's] _another_ _subject_ [but ,] 
A|88| A: _Oh , you_ [are] ? 
B|89| B: [Well [,] uh ,] _okay_ . Now [that's] [inside] [again] , [right ?] 
A|90| A: _Yes ._ 
B|91| B: [Yeah] _, that is_ _what _I_ have_ heard . 
A|92| A: _And _, uh , I_ think that's a_ national [problem] , though . 
B|93| B: _I've_ _had a_ Burmese python _, I've_ _had_ rats _, I've_ _had_ mice 
A|94| A: _But [,_ um _,] then_ [you] didn't [believe] [me] [about] [her] [kids] *listen: [this] [and] utt2 [as] [one] utt _are the_ [they] [are] [so] _good ._ _I'm not_ kidding [you] [but] [she] _does_ [work] [with [them] [and] it's] [a] commitment [and [,] that [,] that's] _what they're_ _called [to_ [do] .] 
B|95| B: _I mean_ [they] go [right] back [where] [they] _came_ [from] . 
A|96| A: Kind [of] scary _when_ _you think_ [about] _that ._ 
B|97| B: [Yeah .] 
A|98| A: [I like] [it [,] uh _,] part_ [of] [my] [problem] [is] [I have] small children [, so _, uh ,] [to_ do] [a] _whole_ [lot] [just] requires [a lot [of] [,] oh ,] coordination [as] _far_ [as] scheduling [and] [that] type [of [,] uh ,] deal [, you know [,] uh ,] 
B|99| B: Learned [about] [their] [basketball] [team] 
A|100| A: Probably [, um _,] uh , let's see [,_ I like] [the] looks [of the] Lincoln Town car 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: More , _more [,_ I] _can_ understand [that [,] that's] _probably_ [what _I] would_ [, uh ,] 
B|103| B: [And , uh _, I] don't know [,_ [a] lot of] younger [people , you know _,] into_ [more] violent crimes . 
A|104| A: [Right .] 
B|105| B: [and] [I'm] _okay_ [. But] [when] [it] [gets] [too] hot [, then] [it's [,] _that [,] I_ _don't] _like_ that_ 
A|106| A: [I have] [two] boys [that are] boy scout age _, and , uh [,_ so] [I] am [very] active [in] Boy Scouts 
B|107| B: _and [it_ , [it] [,] to] [me] [, it] gives [me] [more [,] [a] lot more] control [in] snow [and] ice [and] slick conditions . 
A|108| A: [or] maybe _you [don't_ like] [the] person [you] _have [to_ [,] you] [would] [want to] carpool _with [,_ that] [kind of] _thing_ [, so] [it's [,] it's] [kind _of] a_ _thing_ [where] _, uh , I think_ [the] majority [of the] [people] [do] _not_ carpool . 
B|109| B: _Yeah . Yeah_ [, I] agree 
A|110| A: _Huh _._ [Well_ [,] _that's] ,_ [Well [,] that] _sounds_ _interesting ._ Matter _of fact_ [, uh [, I] guess] [you] [do] _, uh , you_ _get [a_ lot of] graphics [in] _there [,_ I] imagine _, huh ._ 
B|111| B: [Yeah .] 
A|112| A: _I know_ [so [,] I] felt [kind of] sorry [for] him . [that] must [have] _been_ [hard] [on] him [because] [he's] [just] [a] person [but [,] um , I] _never_ [, a] major owner [of] our [of the] [team] _here ._ 
B|113| B: [Yeah .] 
A|114| A: Hello , Lynn . 
B|115| B: [The] Dallas Cowgirls [, huh .] 
A|116| A: Upstate New York _, yeah ._ 
B|117| B: [So [I] think] [for] _, for_ _, for_ many [years _,] uh , we've_ paid teachers [and] police officers [and] firemen [who] [are [, uh ,] to] [a] [great] extent , public servants [uh , [we] have] [not] paid [them] [really] [what they're] worth [in] [what] [they] contribute [to] society . 
A|118| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: _I mean_ [it's] [like] nobody messes [with] [her] mamma . 
A|120| A: _That_ [is] _good ._ 
B|121| B: [Okay .] 
A|122| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: [I] remember seeing [that .] 
A|124| A: Yep . 
B|125| B: [And] [because] [they're] [so] deficient [in] English [, they] haven't [been] able [to] [get] jobs . 
A|126| A: Forty-eight _. That's_ [a] long _time_ [. Uh] . 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|128| A: _Bye-bye ._ 
B|129| B: [The] [, yeah ,] _okay_ . 
A|130| A: [They] [, they] became _, in_ _fact_ [, that's] _probably_ what's [going to] happen _with my_ husband's mother . She's [going to] endanger herself _before_ she'll willingly [and] _probably_ will _never_ willingly [make] [the] [decision] [. And] [that] scares [me] [the , the] thought [of] forcing [somebody] [to do something] . 
B|131| B: See _, I'm_ _talking [about_ _,] like_ _, _in ,_ in [,_ uh _,] I'm_ _afraid_ [I think that] [there] [are] [kids] [who] [just] ought [to be] taken _out of their_ homes [and] reared [. Uh , [I] know] [the] institutions [don't] _work that_ _well [,_ but] [a] [bad] [day] _because I_ _all these_ [kids] _through_ [my] office [. [I] have] [a] _school_ [of] five [hundred] [and] thirty-seven [kids] . 
A|132| A: Where _are you_ [in] relation [to] Sevren ? _are you_ [close] [to] Sevren ? 
B|133| B: [Okay] Carol [. So ,] air quality . 
A|134| A: _But , uh [,_ it's] _a problem_ [, and [I ,] _I] just_ _, [I think_ that] [the] court systems need [to be] [more] accurate [in , in ,] stiffer [in] [their] penalties , 
B|135| B: [Yes .] [Yes .] 
A|136| A: [But] [in] some instances [you're going [to] put] companies [out of] business [by] taking [that] stance , [if] [they] _have [to_ take] [it] [out of their] _own_ retained earnings . 
B|137| B: _What_ [do [you] think] ? 
A|138| A: [Oh ,] _sure_ . 
B|139| B: This [is] bred [for] [, and] _they _had_ to_ go _through_ [and] destroy _a _,_ for_ [a] [while] [there ,] [about] seventy-five percent [of their] puppies [that they] bred . 
A|140| A: A chocolate powder . 
B|141| B: _All [right_ .] 
A|142| A: _And then_ [the] second reunion , _people who_ maybe [, you know ,] [had] sacrificed [things to] _come_ _to the_ first [one] thought [, oh ,] [well [,] _it's] not_ [that] big [a] _thing_ [this] _year_ , 
B|143| B: [Oh] gosh . 
A|144| A: [and then] [you] [end _up] [with_ [the] same] [problem] [and] [you] [take] [their] leftover medicine [, that's] [not] allowed . 
B|145| B: [Yes .] 
A|146| A: [Oh [,] that's] exciting [. [Yeah] .] 
B|147| B: _I've_ _, I've_ [never] _I've_ [never] [even] [been] [called to] jury duty . 
A|148| A: _Oh ._ 
B|149| B: [Right .] 
A|150| A: [Right .] 
B|151| B: [Uh [,] and] [we] _take [the_ , [the] [,] uh ,] civil liberties [, uh ,] [stuff] [too] [far] . 
A|152| A: [Well ,] [when] [I] [was] [, you know ,] [when] [I] [was] growing [up] [I] [had a] clean [the] _cat_ pan [all] _the _time_ [,_ and I] hated [it] [because I] [had to] carry everything upstairs [and [,] you know [,] and] use [this] _thing [to_ [,] you know ,] scoop [the ,] [take the] [stuff] _out and_ _put [it_ _in] the_ toilet [and] everything _it was_ [really] terrible [. But] _now_ [they] [have] [like] [this [,] you] [get] [these] liners [, that is] _garbage_ bags [, you know ,] 
B|153| B: [Oh] yes [. But [, uh ,] we] wouldn't [we] wouldn't [have] [them] [, _I] mean [,_ I don't] [see] _us_ without pets , without _cats ._ 
A|154| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|155| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|156| A: [Yeah [.] Uh-huh .] 
B|157| B: _Um ._ 
A|158| A: _Oh ._ 
B|159| B: [Uh-huh .] _Wow_ [, that's] cute [. That's] neat [, yeah .] When [you] , 
A|160| A: [so we] [just] [, you _know] [._ _I] just_ [do] [the] carpooling [and [,] and] handle [whatever] needs [to be] done [. And] [something] major , [always] needs [to be] done . 
B|161| B: _and [it_ was] difficult _to hold_ [them] together [. [And] then] , [of] course [, he] died [two] [years] [ago [,] so [,] you know [,] that] [family] [has] _gone_ [down] [to] [one] brother [and] [one] sister [now .] 
A|162| A: Yep . 
B|163| B: [Oh ,] [are you] ? [I don't] [care] [for that] [as much] . 
A|164| A: _Oh ._ 
B|165| B: _Very_ [interesting .] 
A|166| A: [Oh ,] no , no , no , no . 
B|167| B: [Yeah .] Flexible [hours] [are ,] [are] [pretty] _important_ [to] [me] [as] _well ._ 
A|168| A: _So you_ [said] [you] [work] [, uh [,] _in] the_ _gardens_ _too _._ Do_ [you] _have [,_ uh [,] a] special flowers ? 
B|169| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|170| A: [What] type [of] lawn [and] garden [work] [do you] [do] ? 
B|171| B: Until [you] pull [the] pin [, yeah .] 
A|172| A: [Yeah .] 
B|173| B: [Right _.] Right [._ Yeah] [, it's] [nice] [to] [get] [out] [in the] open air . 
A|174| A: Long _way_ [, uh ,] 
B|175| B: [Oh ,] _okay_ [. Do] [, do] [they] [play] [like] [, uh _,] like_ [does] [the] eight [year] old [play] baseball ? 
A|176| A: [Yeah . Yeah] [that would] [be] [a] _real_ _good_ idea . _I'm trying to [think_ if] [there's] anything [else] [I] _could_ [think] [of] _. They_ [are] [talking about] [going to] curbside pickup [in] our [, in] our city . 
B|177| B: [I'm trying to think] . Both [, um [,] let's see] [they] _start_ [, um ,] EVENING SHADE [at] [seven] [and [then] it] [goes] [to [,] um [,] what] [is] [it] after EVENING [, um ,] 
A|178| A: [we] were wondering [if] [they] [, uh [,] [they] had] _any_ special law [for the] horses [in] Central Park .

B|243| B: [Yes [,] it is] . 
A|244| A: [and] [as] [a] _matter of fact_ [, I've] [already] done [a] second row [of] radishes . 
B|245| B: [So] [they] found _a [,_ a] _place_ nearby [that they] [put] [her] [in] [last] [year] . 
A|246| A: [But [,] you know [,] [for] the] [most] [part] , gardening [for] [us] [is] , [well [,] [we] got] asparagus [, and [, uh ,] we've] [got] some plum trees [and] some apple trees [and] some tomato [and] some blackberries [and] strawberries .

B|249| B: [And] progressive tax [, [I think] [,] uh ,] [does] [not] give [people] incentive [to] [make] [more [money] [,] and] [what [I] mean] [by] [that [,] the] [more] income [you] [make] [, the] [more] tax [you] [pay] . 
A|250| A: [Exactly .] 
B|251| B: [Well] flower [gardens] [. I like] [to] [have ,] [matter of fact] [this] [past] weekend [I just] [got] finished planting [a] bunch [of] tulips [and] daffodil bulbs [. So ,] [those] ought [to be] coming [up] [around] spring [time]

B|255| B: [Oh [,] it's] unbelievable [how] [much] [you] go [through] . When [I just] [had [a] problem] [with my] neck [and] [they] ended [up] [doing] [a] [seven] [hundred] dollar CAT scan [, and [,] [I] mean [,] a] chiropractor [got] [it in] [one] [time] 
A|256| A: [Well [,] that's] [right [.] But] [I] [do] [think [,] um [,] you know [,] like] [the] current trends [are] [that [,] um [,] the] [family] unit [is] devaluated . It's [not] nearly [as] [important] .
