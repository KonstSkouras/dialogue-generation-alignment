A|38| A: [Right .] 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh .]

A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: _And_ _that , _that_ [,_ the] penalty ought [to be] _out_ [there [,] and] [be] enforced ? 
A|44| A: Who _do you think ?_ The Dallas Cowboys . 
B|45| B: In [that] case , _maybe_ [, you know .] 
A|46| A: [they] had [a] yearly auction _, they_ had [a] dance marathon [for] charity _or _,_ [to_ _,] to_ support [that ,] group . 
B|47| B: [But] [that ,] 
A|48| A: More [and] [more] [people] _are_ , [Right] , [right .] 
B|49| B: [I [don't] have] [one] [in] my home _here_ . My , um , parents [have] [one and] [they] live _just_ [about] three miles [away] , 
A|50| A: [Well [,] uh [,] but] [I] _do_ realize [that , that] [is] realistic [for] _some_ [people] , 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [It] [was] [just] insane twelve _days_ where we'd [just] stop [like] [a] city [a] day [, and] [you] slept [on the] train [at] night . 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: Pretty good trip [. So] [what do you] , [what] kind [of] hobbies [are] [you] [in] ? 
A|56| A: [and] especially [if] [you're] [not] _a person_ [that] [is] [like] [a] medical _person_ [maybe] _or _something_ that_ [the] _person_ needs medical treatment . 
B|57| B: [and [,] you know [,] a lot of] [things like that] [that] [really] [are] _hard_ [to] plan [for] _. And_ [, uh ,] 
A|58| A: _Oh [,_ but] [how] _wonderful_ . Are [you] close [to] getting [it] done ? 
B|59| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|60| A: Just [a] moment [Okay] Nancy [, then I] guess _the ,_ today's subject [is] _benefits_ _in the_ _job_ _other than_ salary . 
B|61| B: [Well [,] it] takes [a] little brainwashing [first] . 
A|62| A: [Right] , [right .] 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: _How_ _would_ [you] [go] [about] organizing _a family_ reunion ? 
B|65| B: [I think [,] we] hope [that] [it] will _be [,_ you know ,] [some] sort [of] deterrent [or [,] you know ,] an eye [for] an eye type _thing_ _, or something_ _like that ._ 
A|66| A: [Yeah .] 
B|67| B: [is] [talking to] someone [in] Sorry . 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: [Yeah .] 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [Oh [,] I] love [it] 
A|72| A: _Yeah ,_ [he] sure _did_ . 
B|73| B: [Well ,] [how] does this grab [you] ? [How] [did] this grab [you] ? _Uh ,_ this [, I , _I] mean ,_ [I'm] , [I'm] [a] lady [, but] this [, I] heard this [on] [a] Christian program [and] [it was [,] uh ,] [about] [the] N E A [and [,] _that's] the_ National Endowment [for] Arts [, and] [they] fund [, they] funded this _thing_ , this act [on] [a] stage [and] [did] [a] study [on] [it] between two lesbians [and] two homosexuals [and] wrote [a] report [about] [that] with our money . 
A|74| A: _Yeah [, I_ think] [you're] [right .] 
B|75| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: You listen [to the] music [and] [then] learn [to] play [it] by by hearing [the] intervals [and] [things [like that] .] 
B|77| B: [Right .] [Well , I] put , 
A|78| A: [But] [, if] _there are_ [some] [people] [who] [don't agree] [uh [,] then] [there] must [be [,] _it] seems_ [to be] [there] must [be] [at] least [a] reasonable doubt [for] [some] [people .] 
B|79| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh _, yeah [,_ and] sometimes [the [,] the] local ones aren't [as] publicized [it seems] [that [,] uh [,] they] should [be] . 
A|80| A: _Yeah ,_ [right] [that's] [I think] [that's the] only [thing] [that's] _going_ [to] change [it .] 
B|81| B: Yep . [Right .] 
A|82| A: [That] _would be_ fair . 
B|83| B: [I] _like it_ better [, I think] . 
A|84| A: The [other] [thing] [then] [is] , [because] _I don't know_ [how] [long] [they] [want] us [to] [talk] , 
B|85| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh _.] Yeah . Yeah ._ 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh [. Yeah . Yeah [.] So] [I , [I don't] know] [in] , [in] terms [of] [other] [things] , [other] [benefits] [other than] sort [of] monetary I'd [, you know [, I] ,] [Yeah , we] [, we] [do] . We [have] [to] contribute [a] [certain] amount [, uh [,] to] [it .] 
A|88| A: [I mean [,] and [I] _think] it's_ _going_ [to be] [real] interesting [to] [see] [and , and] [then] force upon _them_ [, uh ,] 
B|89| B: [So] , let's [talk] [about] [the [,] uh ,] [wonderful] abuses [in the] State [of] Pennsylvania [of] personal property taxes whereby [you] can purchase [something] mail order [and] after [the] fact [, the] State [of] Pennsylvania can find _out_ [about] [it] [and] send [you] [a] bill [for] [the] sales tax appropriate [to] [that] item [that] [you] purchased [as] [well] [as] interest [and] penalties [from the] time [that] [you] bought [it .] [What] [do you think ?] Is Pennsylvania kind [of] _out_ [of] line [there] ? 
A|90| A: I've seen [that [.] Yeah .] 
B|91| B: _And_ [if] [, if] [they know] [some] practice [is] [wrong] [, you know ,] [I'm] [not] [talking] [about] _your_ isolated occurrences , [I'm] [talking] [more] [about] [the [,] you know [,] the] [thing] [that] [they [know] ,] [maybe] [they're] willfully manufacturing [something that] [they know] [is] hurting [people] _out_ [there] [and] [they] continue [to do] [it] even after [they] become aware [of] [that .] 
A|92| A: [Well [,] yeah [,] they] _don't [like_ it] [in] [here] [because] there's nothing [to] eat 
B|93| B: [Yeah [,] [that] , that] Durham , Raleigh [, and] Chapel Hill [is] [the] triangle . 
A|94| A: [Oh] . 
B|95| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|96| A: [It's] [the] least [hard] [on] [your] body [as] far [as] [, uh ,] impact 
B|97| B: Really . [That] [was] smart [. Yeah .] 
A|98| A: Wow . 
B|99| B: None [to] cook [. [I] [don't] like] [to] cook 
A|100| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] [But] [you] still backpacked [and] camped [out] . 
B|103| B: [I think] [for] serial murder [it is] warranted [because] [if] [a person] [who] [would] [do] [something] [like that] [in] cold blood , 
A|104| A: They became [a] very successful immigrant group . [But] _, and [,_ but] [a lot of] [people] coming _over from_ Vietnam , [right] now , coming [from] worn torn countries , [are] , [are] [not] having [the] same success [. I think] [some] [people] [have] [just] assumed , [well] , why , why can't [you] [be] successful ? The Japanese _were_ [, or] [the] Chinese _were_ [, _or something] . And_ [it's really] [much] [more] complicated . 
B|105| B: [Oh] yes , yes . 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [And] [, uh ,] [I'm] building [a] [, a] log house [at] [a] farm [that] [I] [have] [in] East Texas , which [is a] hundred miles [from] [here] . 
A|108| A: [I] [do] too . 
B|109| B: [Yeah , [I] mean ,] [there] [would be] loopholes [just] [like] [there] [is] [in] [anything] else 
A|110| A: [Yeah .] 
B|111| B: [What] [about] yourself ? 
A|112| A: Yes [, that's] similar [to] Georgia . 
B|113| B: [and [,] you know ,] [there are] reason [to] look [for] another [job] instead [of] [just] dumping [it] [on] [them] [all] [at] [one] time . 
A|114| A: today's young [people] [are] short-term pleasure oriented , 
B|115| B: My neighbor , let's [see] , [is] Jewish [. And] he's [going] through [the [,] [I don't] [know] [,] the] Jewish League [or something . And] helping [a family] [that's] come [over from] Russia . 
A|116| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|117| B: We [were] [there] [for] ten [days] . 
A|118| A: [Uh [,] [okay] .] 
B|119| B: [you're] encouraged [to do] [it] [because] , um [, you know [,] it] [, it] helps [you] [, and ,] [of] course [, we] [think it's] helping [other [people] .]
