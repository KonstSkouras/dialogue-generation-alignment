B|25| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh .

B|27| B: [Yeah .] 
A|28| A: Uh [, yeah] [what] [kind of] menu would [you] plan [for] [a] dinner party [and , uh ,] [what] [kind of] dishes [you] might [have] [for] [it] , or [some] sort [of] [thing] [like] that . 
B|29| B: [I] was reading [just] recently where [the] typical administrator [in] [the] , Montgomery County Public Schools makes [, and] [I'm] _not_ , this [is] [, uh ,] [the] figure [, he] makes eighty thousand dollars [a] year . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] [I] see . 
B|31| B: [But] [then] [, uh ,] we also [didn't] _do_ , spend [, uh ,] time [with] [them] trying [to ,] trying [to [,] uh [,] you know [,] just] _family_ time . 
A|32| A: [Yeah .] 
B|33| B: So , can [I] [just] ask [you] , [are] [you] Canadian ? 
A|34| A: [do] [it] [if] somebody [in] [my] [family] or [if] [it] happened [it] me [, you know ,] 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] [Oh] [, that's] great . Long [as] [it's] [not] raining .
