A|40| A: _And , uh _,_ I'm_ [in] California , which _has _a_ lot_ [of] immigration . Probably _more_ than [any] [where] else [in] [the] country , though _I'm_ _not_ sure [if] [that's] [the] case . 
B|41| B: They'll ask [you] whether [you want] bags [or] paper [or] plastic . 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: Which [was] real nice [. I] got married [, uh ,] during [the] Christmas season [and] [we] played [, uh ,] old fashioned Christmas carols instead [of] normal wedding marches [and] what [not] [, and] _it was_ real nice [, I] liked [that] [a lot] . 
A|44| A: _Well_ [, you know ,] 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [Uh [,] [I] think] [it's wonderful] [these] [, these] places [that] aren't nursing homes necessarily [but] [they] [can] go [and] reside [there] [like] [little] apartments , places [in] between places . 
B|47| B: [I [,] uh [,] I] haven't done [any] [of] [that] type [of] [work] _myself_ . 
A|48| A: [Yeah ,] [right .] I'll _take_ [anything] [you know] . 
B|49| B: [Oh _,] yeah_ . That's beautiful . 
A|50| A: You're [in] Plano [also] , huh ? 
B|51| B: Yes . 
A|52| A: Exactly . 
B|53| B: [And] [then] [I] [have] [, uh ,] [a] three eighty-six F X [a] sixteen bit machine , _at_ home .

B|55| B: [And] [then] [just] bake _it_ [, and] _it_ makes [a] [wonderful] sauce over [the] rice . 
A|56| A: Right . Right [. Uh-huh .] Especially [with] [like] [a lot] _of the_ different organizations _now_ [like] [, you know ,] Pro-Life [and , and] [uh ,] Choice _in , in_ [the] special interest groups maybe um , [like] amnesty . 
B|57| B: Pardon me ? 
A|58| A: [Yeah [.] Oh ,] okay . [Yeah [,] you] [do] [then] . 
B|59| B: [Yeah [,] my] brother [has a] home [there] he's trying [to] sell . He , he's living [now] up [, uh [,] [in] , in] Maryland [but] [, uh ,] he , lived [in] Grapevine [for] [a] [long] time . 
A|60| A: [Um ,] [can] [you] [, uh ,] _hang_ on [again] 
B|61| B: [Uh [,] the] Nissan came [and , and] [we] bought [the] Nissan [for] functional purposes [not] what [the] CONSUMER REPORTS said [we] should get . 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [And] they're very dedicated [to] [that _,] and , uh ,_ [it's] [been] [really] [wonderful] [. It] helps [you] [hang] onto _your_ roots . 
A|64| A: [Yeah [,] _uh [,] uh_ ,] isn't [that] weird ? 
B|65| B: [Yeah .] [Well] [I think] [in] large measure [the] reason [they] _don't_ care , [it's] [not] because [the] [punishment [,] but] [so] [many] [of the] people [that] commit crimes _don't_ get punished . 
A|66| A: So [, yeah ,] [it was] [really] fun [, and , uh [,] my] son plays [the] clarinet [in] his band [at] [school [,] and] [my] daughter takes piano lessons , [too .] 
B|67| B: To _try to_ _make_ them [more] effective [and] useful . 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: _How about_ [you] ? Do [you] pay [too] much ? 
A|70| A: [Uh [,] I ,] 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah .] [And , uh [,] if] [I] couldn't [have] [my] luxury Maxima [then] I'd buy me [a] fancy [little] red C R X sports car 
A|74| A: Huh [. Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: Do [you] ? 
A|76| A: [and] [I think] [that's] [the] [one] night [that] [we] [really] [try to] watch television . 
B|77| B: Tell [you] what [, I'm] losing [you] . 
A|78| A: [And I] [was] by [myself] [in] China [too .] 
B|79| B: [And , uh ,] 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: But [if I'm] going [to] be traveling [in] [that] car [for] [any] period [of] time [, I] [want] [some] real good classical music . 
A|82| A: [How about] [your] community ? 
B|83| B: [And ,] [I've] applied [at] another district [where] [many] [of the] children are Asian . 
A|84| A: There [is] [always] [things [that] you] [can] [make] priority [to] [it] [but] [I just] [, I don't] demand [a lot] [for] [myself] [and] [so] [you know [,] [I] just] [feel] entitled [to] [it] 
B|85| B: [And] [uh , uh] Really [the] only objection [we have] Is [uh] [you] [you] give [a] [little] [and] next thing [you know] somebody's trying [to] [take] [more] .
