A|60| A: Sure . 
B|61| B: [it was] [not] gross [, I] didn't [see] [it] [but [,] um ,] got them .

B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: _And they_ _had _,_ I was_ [just] thinking [about] one _the other day_ . [Uh [,] [if] I] saw [a] picture [of] John Elway [in [the] ,] [in the] cafeteria [at] school [, um _,] but they_ [did] [the] Johnny Angel _. They_ [did] Johnny Elway [to] _that ._ 
B|65| B: [Yeah .] 
A|66| A: _And they_ thought [they were] _getting_ [a] great deal [, um [,] because] [they] [could] _get_ [a] five [hundred] thousand dollar home [with _,] they_ call [it ,] zero [lot] lines , no property , [And] [it] [would] [make] [you] ill [to] [see] [this] . 
B|67| B: _The_ [, at] least [the] version [I] [had] tended _to keep_ copies _of that ._ Of [what] [you] [were] changing [and] deleting _off_ [in] memory until _all [of_ ,] _all [of_ a] sudden [you] got [a] disc full error . Not [a] fun thing [to] _try to_ recover [from] .

It's [a] , [in a] nice neighborhood [. The] houses [here] [, uh ,] _before_ [the] recession [were] running [two] [hundred] thousand [or] [so] [and ,] course , everything's down ten [to] twenty [percent] _now ._ 
B|91| B: [Yeah [, I] think] [it was] November [and] [I] [don't] [do] anything [to] mine , water them [or] anything [And they] [just] [, they] [do] [really good] [and] [I] even [had [,] uh [, I] guess] [it was] last [year] [or] [the] [year] [before] [, I] [had] [some] out [and it] froze [and the] pansies looked terrible [, but they] came back later [. I] didn't [do] anything [to] them [so] [they] [are] [, uh [,] they] [are] [good] [to] plant [in the] winter time [. They] last [for] [a] long time [then] . So [, if you] start putting them [, you know [,] [you] can] [put] them out [in the] spring [too] [, but] once [it starts] [getting] real hot [then] [it just] kills them cause [they] [can't] stand [the] hot weather .
