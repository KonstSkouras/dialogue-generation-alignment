A|10| A: It _was_ [the] Protestant version _of the_ Catholic pilgrimage . 
B|11| B: _Uh-huh_ _, it_ _really_ _could_ _, and _,_ uh ,_ _then_ , how , sometimes , how [the] media will blow _things_ _out of_ proportion _and_ will run an _issue_ _into the_ ground _which_ _is_ _good_ _and_ dead _, and_ [they] keep dragging _it_ _on_ _, and it_ _could_ hamper [the] outcome [of] an election _for the_ guy _that_ should _have_ won .

B|15| B: _Yeah ,_ _there_ _are_ . Um _, I'm_ living _in a_ dorm _right_ now _, and_ _so_ _right_ downstairs _there's_ _a_ facility _.

A|16| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _Yeah ,_ same _with_ drunk drivers . 
A|18| A: _That's_ [right] [, uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: _So_ she _would_ _just_ substitute once _or_ twice _a_ week _, you know ,_ _just_ _for_ _that_ little extra money _when_ _we were_ [in] _school_ .

A|20| A: About quality . 
B|21| B: Um , now _I_ didn't [know] _that ,_ _cause_ _we_ _just_ usually _if_ we're _going to , uh ,_ buy sodas _they're_ _in _the_ , the_ _two_ liter bottles . 
A|22| A: Those [are] _nice_ , aren't [they] ? Yes , those [are] _nice ._ 
B|23| B: _Uh _,_ well _,_ of course _,_ you_ talk _gun_ controls down _here_ [in] Texas _and_ you're asking _to be_ lynched . 
A|24| A: [Yeah _,] I_ voted absentee _one_ year _. [I_ really] _was_ [going [to] be] gone _. _So_ _,_ I_ did _it _,_ but [,_ uh [,] it] _was_ _nice _._ I_ _would be_ tempted [to do] [it] again . 
B|25| B: My brother _had_ fish _when I_ [was] _a_ kid [I] remember _that _,_ and_ [one] [of] his fish jumped _out [of_ _the] _,_ um ,_ gosh , what [do] [you] call [it ,] fish tank _. And_ fried itself _, on the_ radiator behind [the] dresser . I'll _never_ forget _that_ _because_ [I] remember _my_ brother , _he_ came _home and_ _he_ counted [the] fish 
A|26| A: _but_ before [that ,] [for] _most_ [of the] year _, it's_ been hot [and] dry . 
B|27| B: [Yeah .] 
A|28| A: [I think] _that's_ [really] _true ._ 
B|29| B: what _kind_ , 
A|30| A: [Yeah .] 
B|31| B: Right . 
A|32| A: [and] [we] ended _up_ [with] _them_ , _right [._ And] [so] [we were] , walking _up_ 
B|33| B: Right _, that's_ [true [.] I] knew [that] . 
A|34| A: _um _, I_ had_ _them_ delayed [because] [I'm] _back_ [in] graduate [school] [and] [on] [that] form [it] says [if] _your_ joining [the] Peace Corps [you] _can_ [have] _them_ delayed 
B|35| B: [Yeah .] 
A|36| A: [So] [there's] [the] potential [that] perhaps [, you know [,] the] U S budget might _want_ [to] _take_ [a] look _at_ _it's_ [, uh ,] federal employees _or [,_ and] _take_ [a] look _at_ saying [, well ,] let's freeze wages [. I] mean everybody's doing [it] [so] [it] isn't [like] [, uh ,] private business has [had] [to do] [it] 
B|37| B: [So ,] _just ,_ [like] _in a_ thirteen by nine pan . 
A|38| A: [And] [with] _all [the_ ,] see I've got [, on the] south side [is] [all] glass _. _Well_ ,_ _as_ _much_ _as_ [I] [could] get [in] [it [,] you know] [. _And] , uh [,_ the] east side [is] glass . 
B|39| B: Cooking chocolate . 
A|40| A: _That's_ interesting . 
B|41| B: [And _,] um [,_ it's] causing quite [a] stir [up] _here ,_ [because] we're [so] close [to] D C anyway . 
A|42| A: Are [you] ready [to] start ? 
B|43| B: [So _,] if_ [it's] [your] peers [and] you're _not_ educated _then_ , 
A|44| A: [And I] _said_ [I think] [the] only _way_ [I] _would be_ [in] _big_ favor [of] [gun] control [is] [if] [they] [could] absolutely guarantee [that] nobody [would] [have] _them [._ And [I] think] [that] [would] almost [have to] [go] [with] armies [, too] [. I] mean , they'd _have to be_ almost world-wide [, which] [we] [know] [would] [never] ever happen . 
B|45| B: _But_ everybody else works [and] [they] drop _their_ kids off [at] day-care _and [,_ and] leave [them] _and _,_ I don't know , I just_ _don't_ [want] _, I just_ _don't_ [want] strangers _raising_ _my_ children . 
A|46| A: We tried [to] start [that] [in] [my] husband's family . His mother's side decided [they] [were] [going _to] _have_ a_ reunion [a] couple [of] years _ago _,_ and I_ _said [,_ well] let's start _this_ letter [, and it] [just] [never] [my] husband's sisters started _it and_ sent [it] [to] us [and] [that's] _as_ far _as_ [it] got [. I] sent [it [,] on] [to] [the] next [one] , 
B|47| B: [Oh [,] well _,] that's_ [nice .] 
A|48| A: [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: _Uh-huh . Well_ _that's ,_ 
A|50| A: [Yeah [,] I] mean [it [,] it] [was] [really] exciting , _growing_ [up] [when] , [when] [the] Cowboys [were] _really big_ . Because [my] parents [would] [always] [have] season tickets [, and] they'd [go to] _all the_ games [, and] [you know [,] the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . It's [just [,] you know [,] the] last , _oh_ [I] guess probably since _about_ eighty-four , _about_ eighty-five [was] [when] [they] started [kind of] [going] downhill [really] _, but [,_ you know [,] I'm] [just] used [to] [always] _growing_ [up] [and] hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys [, and [,] you know ,] Super Bowl [, and] [all] _this_ other [stuff] _. [So_ [,] I] can't [, you know [,] I'm] [not] [going to] decide [I don't] [like] [them] [just] [because] [they're] _having_ [a] few bad years [. I] mean _, I think_ they'll pull [out of] [it [,] and [,] you know ,] they'll , they'll wind [up] being [good] again . They've got _some_ , _lot of_ [really] [good] young players [that] [are] [going to [,] that] [are] [going to , uh ,] [do] _pretty_ [good] _, I think_ _. But [,_ they're] [raising] prices [on] [their] tickets _. So_ [they're] banking [on] doing [good] next season _. I think_ tickets [are] , 
B|51| B: [Oh [,] that] sounds lovely . [Uh-huh .] [Oh [,] the] wild flowers [are] beautiful [. I think] _, [um ,_ I] [was] thinking [about] throwing [some] [for] _, in the_ [back] , [just] where [the] kids _, um ,_ [just] [way] _in the_ [back] , behind [the] swing sets [or ,] [just] _have some_ wild flowers [growing] [back] _there_ [would be] real [pretty] . Then [you] [don't] [really] [have [to] have] [much] maintenance involved . 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh . _Well] , I_ _still_ [, all] three [of] [my] daughters [are] married _, but [,_ I don't know , I just] _still_ [have] need [for the] four bedrooms [just] _having_ company from _time_ [to] _time [._ And] [some] [of] [them] coming [back] [home and] [things] [, you know] . 
B|53| B: [And , uh [,] I had] sandy loam hauled [in] [. [I] had] [a] dump truck come [and] dump [it] . 
A|54| A: [and] [when I] went [to] [school] [that] [just] wasn't put [up] [with] . 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [Yeah ,] ours [really] needs [to [have] some] work done [on] [it] _but _,_ but_ [then] [my] husband [, um ,] worked [at] T [I] [and I] got _a [,_ um ,] _this_ has been years _ago_ _he doesn't_ work [there] anymore _, but_ [he] got _a [,_ um [,] uh [,] [the] , the] T [I] professional [and] brought [that] [home [and] I] learned Wordstar [on] [that ,] 
B|57| B: [and] [most] kids these days [have] gotten themselves _into_ [, uh ,] financial situations , where [they] [have to be] working [all the time .] 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] _No [,_ I] understand [that] totally 
B|59| B: [So] [he] donates [a] [lot] , [not] everything [, but] [a] [lot [of] the] material . Then what [he doesn't] donate [we] [just] [go] [out] [and] buy . 
A|60| A: She put [them] [in] [like] [two] months _ago_ [cause] [they] [are] winter plants . 
B|61| B: [Uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|62| A: [um [,] um [,] but] [it] [just ,] work [in the] garden , work around [the] yard [, of course ,] 
B|63| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|64| A: _Well [,_ [that's] ,] [Yeah .] 
B|65| B: [so] [I don't] [do] [that] [. So] [I] [take] [it [and] I] send [, and I] mail [it] [back] [to] [them .] 
A|66| A: [Uh ,] [my] husband [and] [my] other [son] , who's eleven [just] got through singing [in a] musical [here [,] in] [, in the] community [at] Music Man . 
B|67| B: [And] [the] man [said [,] [that] [,] you know _,] if_ [it] weren't [for the] fact [that] [he] [would] [go to] jail [, that] [he] [would] eliminate [this] person himself [. And] [then] [go to] McDonalds [and] [have a] hamburger [and] [not] [thing] [a] [thing] , [think] [a] [thing] [about] [it] . 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [Yeah ,] [we have] . We . We did , [we] whirlwinded through , Europe . 
B|71| B: [Well , I] [can] tell [you] [, that] [the] Mets opened [, I think] , [two] days [ago ,] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah [,] well [,] that] makes _a [really_ big] difference [. But [,] but ,] [still] [it's] [just] [as] hard [as] [having] [, [that] ,] 
A|74| A: That stress [is] [a] [very] prominent factor [in the] work place [and it] affects , 
B|75| B: [Uh ,] yeah , 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: You must [have [a] ,] [a] [son] . 
A|78| A: [Uh-huh] almost cruel [for] him [to ,] [to] walk . 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: That [still] does [it [,] that's] _right ._ 
B|81| B: [No [,] that's] [not] [right .] [That's] [not] [right .] [That's] [not] [right .] 
A|82| A: [I] [, I don't] either . It's [a really] delicate [, uh ,] moral , [issue] . Because [, if] [you] [have] [, well [,] I] guess [the] [one] [thing] [I do] see [that] [is , is] [that] needs [to be] [a] solution [is [,] that] [if] [you] [do] let people [into the] country [, [I] do] [feel] [you] [have a] certain obligation [to ,] [to] get [them] [on] [their] feet . 
B|83| B: [And] he's [like] [oh] , thank [you] [so] [much] . 
A|84| A: Wow .
