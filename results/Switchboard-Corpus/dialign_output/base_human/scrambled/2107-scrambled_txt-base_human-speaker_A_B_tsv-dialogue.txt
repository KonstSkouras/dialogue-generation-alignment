A|0| A: _Oh ._ 
B|1| B: _Well ,_ you've _been_ quite _a few_ places _there_ 
A|2| A: _Yeah _._ But_ _it's _,_ I , I_ _know_ . 
B|3| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|4| A: _I_ _know_ _they_ _put_ _, uh ,_ _put_ _them_ _in_ jail _sometimes_ _, I guess_ _. Uh ,_ 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: _Right_ _, right_ . _Right ._ 
B|7| B: _Yeah _,_ we_ still _got_ _some_ _from_ _last_ year . 
A|8| A: _and_ _it_ pays _you_ _to_ use _it _._ I_ mean _, if_ _you_ _pay_ your bill _off_ _right_ away _, if_ _you don't_ _ever_ _have to_ _pay_ _any_ interest _on_ _it because_ _they_ _give_ _you_ _a certain_ amount every _time_ _that_ _you_ use _it ,_ 
B|9| B: _So [,_ uh _,] _but_ _I_ think_ _there are_ _some_ wonderful _child care_ opportunities _out_ _there for_ _children_ _but _,_ and_ _we_ _all_ [know] _the_ _kind_ _of things that_ you're supposed [to] _look_ _for_ [. _I] think_ , 
A|10| A: _Uh _,_ I_ personally [know] nothing _about_ [the] Peace Corps _though ._ 
B|11| B: Okay . 
A|12| A: People _get_ shipped _off_ [and] _then _,_ you know [,_ and] _then [,_ and] _then_ _their_ _parents_ _, _I_ _have_ a_ _, uh , a_ _, a_ friend _whose_ _, whose_ son _is_ _in the_ Peace Corps _in_ Guatemala _, or_ _daughter_ _is_ _in the_ Peace Corps _in_ Guatemala _right now_ . 
B|13| B: _and _,_ and _,_ and _, uh ,_ [you_ don't] _realize_ _how_ _many_ dishes [you] [put] onions _in _,_ that_ [it's] an ingredient , 
A|14| A: Gosh _, small_ world _, huh ?_ 
B|15| B: _Huh ,_ stick shift [, huh ?] 
A|16| A: _Uh-huh . Yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _Oh ,_ 
B|19| B: Bye . 
A|20| A: Good . 
B|21| B: _That's_ _all_ _I got_ [to] _say_ _for_ [it .] 
A|22| A: [So] [the] _seven_ [of] us _went_ _on_ [a] cruise [and] _then_ _went_ [to] Disney together . [So] _that's_ _all the_ _family_ _, so_ planning _our_ _family_ reunion _was_ _very_ _easy_ _you know_ . 
B|23| B: [Oh _,] _I'm_ , I'm_ [a] dog _person_ [. _I] _had_ [,_ I guess] [it] depends [on] _what_ [you] _had_ _when_ he _were_ [a] _kid [,_ right] ? 
A|24| A: Same _thing ,_ Yes . 
B|25| B: _We_ _only_ _see_ [the] tip _of the_ iceberg _only_ . 
A|26| A: _And_ _I _,_ and _I_ [,_ and] [I'm] saying [to] myself _, well _,_ you know , you_ dump your , your , your _little_ turnip _off_ _to _,_ uh _, you know ,_ this_ [child care] place _and they don't_ _pay_ _very much_ [and] why , why _would_ _they_ _be_ interested _in , in_ your _little_ turnip unless _, you know _,_ _one_ [of_ the] motivations _in the_ hidden agenda _is_ _well_ _that's_ somebody [to] molest _, you know_ . 
B|27| B: _uh _, I don't_ know_ _how_ expensive _they are _._ It_ sounds _like_ [that] _it would_ _probably_ , 
A|28| A: [That's] _even_ harder _. But ,_ 
B|29| B: _and , uh ,_ _she_ [was] , _she_ _did_ _not_ _want_ [any] _part of_ swimming _but_ _she_ liked _to , to_ _get [in_ the] pool _on the_ first step . She'd _just_ [get] _on the_ first step [and] lay down _. You know_ [in the] summertime _when_ _it's really , really_ hot . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh] 
B|31| B: No [, I , I] can't _say_ _that [I_ have] either [. But [,] uh ,] 
A|32| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|33| B: _And I'm_ amazed [sometimes] _what_ [I] _see_ [on] _there [._ But] [I'm] [very] intrigued [. [I] [,] one] [time] [I] [was] watching an operation [, and I] thought , _Gee_ _, I don't_ believe [I'm] watching . 
A|34| A: [and [I] _,] it_ changed _, it_ [probably] changed _my_ political views [it] changed _my_ understanding [of the] world _around_ _me_ 
B|35| B: [Right] 
A|36| A: [Yeah ,] huh-uh [, and] especially [not] [in] [some] [of] _these_ big cities _, like_ [in] Dallas [I] mean they've [had _,] they're_ _up_ [in the] top , top five [I think] [of] cities _that are_ getting policeman _killed_ [on] , [on] _, in the_ line [of] duty [and] _that's_ [really] sad . 
B|37| B: _That's _,_ that's _,_ that_ threw [our] budget [really] _out_ [of] whack _too ._ An _we_ _, um ,_ _have been_ _just_ forced [to] budget [much] _more_ [because] [I] quit _working_ _to be_ _home_ _with the_ kids _. _And_ _,_ um _,_ we_ _just_ [really] [have] _, uh _, I don't_ [know_ _,] we_ , we've tried different times , we've _done_ _like a_ survey [of] [like] taking _, you know , the_ past _three_ _months_ [of] _where_ [all _the] money_ [went] . 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] _Right _._ Uh-huh ._ [Right] , [because] _they're_ [a] danger [to] everybody _else_ . [Huh [,] that's] interesting [. [I] _have] [to_ [,] uh] agree _with that ._ 
B|39| B: [Right _.] That's_ _true [._ [Yeah] [,] well [,] _it] , [it_ [,] you know , you] [get] [certain] circumstances _where_ [you] hear [about] [these] _people_ [that] [have] [, you know ,] stolen kids _and , you know ,_ _done_ terrible _things_ [to] _them and_ [killed] _them _and ,_ you know _,_ that_ sort [of] [thing ,] 
A|40| A: [Gee] . 
B|41| B: _Uh-huh _. Uh-huh_ , yeah ._ 
A|42| A: [Well ,] those [are] skills [that] [she] _certainly_ _is_ _going to_ _need_ _early_ [on] [and [, you know _,] the] [,_ and] [it] seems [like] [it's] getting earlier [and] earlier [with the] [children] . 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [Well [,] I] mean [, but] [you] didn't [have] oboe _or_ something [with] [it] ? 
B|45| B: _Yeah [, I_ ,] sort [of] weird _for_ [me] _to have_ [had] [one] _too_ [but] _there_ [, _it] _was_ a_ convenient [little] pet _to have_ [because] [it] stayed [in] its cage [and , you know [,] _it] was_ [easy] . Easy [to] take [care] [of] 
A|46| A: [Well [,] _I] had _the_ , [I_ had] [a] broiled chicken breast [and] [it was] excellent [. It] [was a] marinated , broiled chicken breast [and] [it was] 
B|47| B: Pardon ? [I'm] studying speech pathology . 
A|48| A: [That's] cool . 
B|49| B: [Well ,] 
A|50| A: [Well ,] [it's] [to] protect _the [,_ the] banks [from] guys [that] [say] [yeah] [I] _want to_ build _my_ own house [and] _go_ [out] [a] build [a] spec [home] 
B|51| B: Huh-uh . 
A|52| A: Which makes _her [, I_ guess] , unshowable , _even_ _if she_ [had] papers _which_ [she] doesn't 
B|53| B: _Um ,_ [all] [of] his direct descendants , descendants [have] [now] died [and] [the] grandchildren [are] _in their_ seventies [and] eighties . 
A|54| A: [And] _then_ [I] [went] [to] England [a few] years ago . 
B|55| B: [Uh] [Uh [,] uh ,] although [I] _do [,_ uh , _a] lot _of_ ,_ 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|58| A: [Right .] 
B|59| B: [I] _see_ . 
A|60| A: Seems [like] [I] [just] bought [it .] 
B|61| B: [But] [if] [I had the] [little] red C R X [, I guess] [the] interior [would] [have _to] be_ black leather [and] _I'd_ [have to] _live_ [with that _.] And_ [if] _I got_ [the] C R X _it would_ [have _to] [have_ a] real _good_ sound system [in] [it because] _I'd_ [want] [that] _too ._ 
A|62| A: [Huh] . 
B|63| B: [Yeah [.] [I] _,] uh _, I don't_ [know_ _,] I think_ [the [, I] guess] _there's_ _a lot of_ problems [with the] legal system 
A|64| A: [Huh] . 
B|65| B: There's _should _be_ [,_ you know , this] _, for_ [this] _crime_ [, this] _is the_ penalty _. You_ [killed] , _someone_ [you know [,] in] cold blood [or] whatever . 
A|66| A: [And [,] and , uh [,] that's] _pretty_ [much] [all the] houses [in the] area [, for] [probably] [a] square mile , [I'd] _say ,_ _at_ least , _maybe_ _even_ _a little_ bit [more] than [that .] 
B|67| B: _We_ expected [it] [to] continue forever [. [I] think] [they're] doing [pretty] [well] [this] year [though .] 
A|68| A: [It] might [have a] new name . 
B|69| B: [So] _what_ [about] yours ? 
A|70| A: [Well ,] let's hope [not] [. You] _can_ [be [,] uh ,] [get in] trouble _for that ._ 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: _Well , [there_ are] [a lot [of] things that] [people] [, I think] general , 
B|73| B: [Oh [,] that's] _nice_ . 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|75| B: The police [don't] catch [them] [, or] [the] courts [don't] convict [them] [, _or] , or_ [they don't] serve [very much] [of the] [time] [and] [so] [, uh , you know ,] [their] , [their] success rate [is] [very] high . Crime _does_ [pay] [, you] [can] _make a_ _good_ living [at] [it .] 
A|76| A: [You [know] [,] and] [I'm , I'm] thinking woman , wake _up_ [and] smell [the] roses _before_ [they] _come_ [and] [get] [you] [. But] ... 
B|77| B: _but _,_ uh [, _I_ think] it's_ [a] _good_ idea [because] [a lot of] [people] still [want to] drive [the] older cars [which] [you] can't blame [them] [for that] 
A|78| A: Or [, you know ,] _plead insanity_ . 
B|79| B: [and [,] and] who's [, you know , the] tuna [is] radioactive [to] [a certain] extent . 
A|80| A: _They_ _look like_ , [Yeah ,] [they] seem [like a] tennis ball [but] [it] almost doesn't _look like_ [it's] almost livable _yeah [,_ the] _best_ [I [, I] don't] [think] [I] _could_ [, I , I] _could_ handle those tennis balls . [So _,] what_ _else_ [to] [you] tape besides AMERICAN [at] _, there_ _anything_ _else_ ? 
B|81| B: [huh] . 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [Uh-huh] 
A|84| A: [Yeah _.] Uh [,_ _and] a_ friend [of] mine _who_ [had] _gone_ [for] [a] business trip [to] China [and] [she] [just] gave [me] [this] woman's name [to] contact [and] [it would] [really] [be] fun [, I think] ideally [with] [like] two couples _because _you_ [have_ a] car _and a_ driver _and a_ guide 
B|85| B: Some [of] [that] opportunity [for] job change [in the] fact [that] _, that_ aspects changing . 
A|86| A: [Right .] 
B|87| B: [So] [that] _, that_ works [out] _good_ . 
A|88| A: Yes [, it] [is] . 
B|89| B: [so] TRAVEL AND LEISURE , FOOD AND WINE [and [I] think] _they _have_ some_ others [, uh ,] [certainly] half [the] pages [and] [maybe] [more] [are] pure ads plus _they have_ [the] advertising supplement sections [that are] supposed [to] [look like] articles [but] [are] paid [for] [and they don't] [care] [if] [they] _make_ [any] _money_ _on the_ magazine subscription [, they're] making everything [on] ads . 
A|90| A: A T S ? 
B|91| B: [Yeah .] 
A|92| A: That [is the] reason [, I don't] play over [there .] 
B|93| B: [but] usually [it's] [not] until later _It's_ [really] strange . 
A|94| A: [but] [it] [is] [nice] [to have] [it because] [there's] [, uh ,] [with] [our] size [of] _family_ [it's] [nice] [to] [know] [that] [there's] [one] [that's] _always_ straight [and] clean [if] _you have_ [someone] _come_ [just] [on the] spur [of the] moment . 
B|95| B: [Oh .] 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] Yes , [they are .] 
B|97| B: _It's_ [like] [all] [right] [, whose] corners _is this_ _one ._ 
A|98| A: [And] [the] [only] other avenue [that I] [can] [think] [of] [is] [, uh ,] looking [at] [where] [they're] spending [the money] [and] [not] _so much_ as saying [, well ,] we're spending [too] [much] [in] [that] area as perhaps looking [at] [what] [is] costing _them [the_ money] . As _for [,_ for] instance [, I think] [you] [probably] remember [the] military getting caught [, um ,] [with] toilet seats [that] cost [them] four hundred , five hundred _dollars_ . 
B|99| B: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ He , he [always] _did_ such [a] _good_ job [, I] thought . 
A|100| A: [Oh .] 
B|101| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|102| A: [I think it's] [like] [three] [or] four _dollars a_ [, a] [can] 
B|103| B: [and [,] so] [now] [they're] [going to] [get] [even] . 
A|104| A: [Yeah [,] that's] [true .] 
B|105| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [Huh] . 
B|107| B: [Uh-huh . Yeah [.] Uh-huh .] 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] [Huh] [. Uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: He's _got_ [on] [I] B M . 
A|110| A: [or] [would] [they] [really [,] you know ,] [make a] contribution [of] [some] [kind] . 
B|111| B: [Yeah .] 
A|112| A: [Yeah .] 
B|113| B: [there's] _no_ question [about] [that] [, so] . 
A|114| A: [Right [.] And] [what] _type_ [of] recommendations [did] _you have_ [when] [you] _decided_ [where] [to] place him ? 
B|115| B: Twelve [children] ? 
A|116| A: [Oh _,] oh_ _yeah [,_ and] every [time] [you] [see] [one] hit [on the] side [of the] road [you] [say] [is] [that] _my_ cat . 
B|117| B: [Right .] They're doing [that] [in] [our] state _, too ._ 
A|118| A: Then you'll _never_ leave . 
B|119| B: [Yeah .] 
A|120| A: [That's] [right] [. Uh-huh , yeah [.] [I] [have] some] friends [that] _live in_ Westport _and [it's_ really , really] bad [. I] mean _you ,_ 
B|121| B: My _husband_ _is a_ physician [, so] _, uh [, I_ , I] [I] talk [to] [parents] [about] [this] [a lot] [. But] [children] [, I [, I] think] _working_ mothers [or] mothers [who] choose [to] _work_ outside [the] [home] [, um ,] [need] [very] [early] [to] [come] [to] grips [with] [any] guilt _, that_ [they] feel [and] decide what's [best] [for] _them and_ [their] [family] . 
A|122| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: [Yeah [.] Yeah .] 
A|124| A: [Um [,] I don't] [, I] am [only] twenty-eight [and I] haven't [had] [much] experience [with] nursing homes [. [I] don't] [, [I] have] _never_ visited [any] [of] [them [and [,] uh ,] I don't] [think] _I've_ _ever_ [even] [been] [in] [one .] Have _you ?_ 
B|125| B: [Well] _good_ [, well] _good_ _. Well [,_ uh [,] uh ,] [have] [you ,] [have] [you] _done_ [any] jogging ? [I] tell [you [,] you] _said_ [you] [did] [on the] bike [and] [on the] treadmill [in [, in] [the] [,] uh ,] club . 
A|126| A: [Um] [. Uh-huh [.] Well [,] you] [always] [have] castration 
B|127| B: [And] _so I_ [decided] [well [,] if] she's [going _to] do_ [that] [, [it] would] [be] [a] whole [lot] easier [if she] [could] [type] 
A|128| A: [And [,] uh [,] that] [really] [should be] [in] your [but] [if] [you don't] spend [it , it] [should be] [in] your bank account [at] [the] end [of the] month 
B|129| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|130| A: [It] [really] [is a] _small_ , hostile planet 
B|131| B: [They] [plead insanity] 
A|132| A: [I] [know] [it [,] _and] [you_ know] [what] ... 
B|133| B: [So] [you] _got_ [to] [give] [them] either [more] [time] [in the] system [or] [a] different process [that] will hopefully _work_ better . When [it] comes down [to] [things] [like] alternative sentencing [, I'm] [all] [for that] [for [,] uh [,] small] crimes , infractions [and] misdemeanors [or] parking tickets [or] traffic tickets [that] [have] [gone] [to] warrant [, you] [give] [them the] option [of] _working_ [off] [their] [time] doing civil service sort [of things] . 
A|134| A: [Uh ,] 
B|135| B: [I've] [never] seen [you] [before] Who [are] [you ?] 
A|136| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|137| B: [Yeah .] 
A|138| A: [and] we're [out] [, you know [,] uh , you know ,] fifteen _thousand dollars_ [and [, you know ,] the] guy gets [out] [in] two [months] 
B|139| B: Twenty [thousand [dollars] a] year [, if] [they're] lucky [. I] _wouldn't_ _do_ [it] [for that .] 
A|140| A: [Uh-huh [. Uh-huh] .] 
B|141| B: [Right [.] [Yeah] [,] [and] it's] also [, [right] now] [it's [,] uh [,] the [,] like] everywhere [else] [, uh ,] _here_ [in] Pittsburgh [the] health [care] [, uh ,] rates [are] , [are] [going] [up] [pretty] quickly . 
A|142| A: [Well ,] white paper's bad [too .] [They] , [they] treat [it [,] too .] 
B|143| B: [Yeah .] 
A|144| A: [Oh ,] except [the] [kid [,] huh] [, that's ,] 
B|145| B: [You] [live in] Pennsylvania ? 
A|146| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|147| B: [Yeah [,] yeah _.] That's ,_ 
A|148| A: [Yeah .] 
B|149| B: [Yeah .] No , we've [never] [had] [anything] [like] [that .] 
A|150| A: [Oh] [no] . 
B|151| B: Because they'll arrest [someone] [and , you know ,] [go] through [all] [that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [, and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and [you] [have] to] [even] [be] careful _how_ [you] arrest [them] _, how_ [you] talk [to] [them] [, uh , you know [,] what] [they] [say ,] 
A|152| A: [Right] [, right] . 
B|153| B: Anyway . 
A|154| A: [Uh-huh [.] That's _,] yeah [,_ a] [really] [good] friend [of] mine _lives in_ Penn Hills [, and] they've [been] [in their] house _, oh ,_ [probably] [about] twelve years [now] 
B|155| B: [Uh [,] yeah ,] unfortunately [the] [little] portable P C _that was_ plugged [on the] _back_ [was] [only] [a] [seven] [and a] half megahertz , eighty , eighty-six _. It's_ [like] slow [out] [the] 
A|156| A: [Um [,] [but] ,] [it's] [just] again [, the [,] the] privacy [, you know] . [Um [,] we] [had] [a] house [in] Minneapolis [that was] [on] [three] acres [, and] _my_ [husband] [was] raised [, um ,] [on] [a] [working] farm near 
B|157| B: [I think it's] [too] [easy] [for] _them ._ 
A|158| A: [Uh-huh [.] Well [,] like] [I ,] [said] [, I] [live in] [a] [small] place [. You know] . 
B|159| B: [You] [ever] heard [of] [that] ? 
A|160| A: [Yeah [, I] don't know] [if] they've , [they] [did] something [about] [I'm] [not] sure [if] Texas , Minnesota [, I ,] [they] didn't , [they] didn't , [they] [were] [well ,] [did] [they have] [it ,] [they] [were] against [it [,] uh ,] Texas , as [I] [said] , has [it] [but I] haven't [been] [back] [here] long enough [to , to] [realize] whether [or] [not] [, if] they've [done] [it] [in the] [last] , 
B|161| B: [but] Washington [is] [one of] [my] favorite places [to] visit [. Uh ,] [my] [daughter] [lives in] Arlington [, and] [when] [I] [go] [to] visit [her , I] love [to] [get] [out] [on] [that] bike trail [, and] either ride [the] bike [, oh ,] gosh [, you] [can] ride [a] bike practically [all the] way [to] Southern Virginia [or] [just] [get] [out] [and] walk [, uh [,] or] [even] jog [a little] , although [I don't] _do_ [that] regularly . 
A|162| A: [Well ,] [not] [really] [. It's] [, uh ,] [it's] [on the] side [of] [a] hill . 
B|163| B: [Yeah ,] uh-huh . 
A|164| A: [Well [,] oh ,] hobbies , gee whiz [, I guess] [I got] [too] [many] hobbies [so I] [never] [have] [time] [to] deal [with] [them .] 
B|165| B: [and] [they're] [go] [around] [and] collect cans [and] aluminum [and] stuff , 
A|166| A: [Oh , yeah .] [Um] . 
B|167| B: Sort [of] [easy] listening [because you] [like] country [but] [then ,] 
A|168| A: [And] [they're] [, they're] incredible victims [of] [crime] [. And] [part of] [it] [is this] lack [of ,] lack [of] basic information , being dissimilated [. [And] I'm] [not] saying [it's] [easy] [to [do] [,] and I] [know] [there are] [a few] [people] [who] [are] trying [, [but] [,] but] [the] funding isn't [there for] [very much] [work] [to be] [going] [on] . 
B|169| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|170| A: [Yeah [.] And] [that] [does] [make a] [a] [person] [want to] stay 
B|171| B: [Uh-huh [, yeah] [,] yeah .]

B|175| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|176| A: Thirty day notice [for] [what] ?
