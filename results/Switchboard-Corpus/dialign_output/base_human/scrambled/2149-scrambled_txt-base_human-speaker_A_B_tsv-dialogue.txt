B|5| B: _You_ [go] [to] _school_ [and you] _have a_ kind _of a_ captive audience , [get] [them] [all] _in the_ auditorium , 
A|6| A: _But ,_ [in the] house itself _, I've_ [been] working inside _, you know ,_ these , these many months 
B|7| B: _Yeah ,_ yeah [. Well ,] To _some_ extent [if] _they_ _would_ _do_ _something_ _with_ _some_ [of] those _people_ . [But] _that_ seems _to _be_ a good_ _way_ [to] [get] _off_ [for _a] lot of_ [them] [too] . 
A|8| A: [Well _,] I ,_ actually _I don't know_ [a lot] _about_ _different_ brands _. I_ tend [to] _have _,_ you know _,_ my_ requirements [like] [the] last _time_ _I_ bought [a] car _I _, I_ guess_ _I_ _did_ _sort of_ prefer American [and] _my_ requirements _were_ basically _, you know _,_ good_ repair record _, good_ mileage [, uh _,] _and_ I_ needed air-conditioning _and , uh ,_ _can't_ _remember_ _what_ _my_ , [oh _,] I_ wanted [uh ,] stick shift . _And ,_ _so_ _I_ didn't [have a] whole [lot of] choice There _was one_ car [in] [all] [of _the] _,_ the_ metropolitan area _that I_ could find _that _,_ you know ,_ _was_ _sort [of_ a] medium priced car [with] [a] stick shift [in] _it ._ 
B|9| B: hopefully [, it's] _not_ [my] wife . 
A|10| A: _Uh _,_ that_ God _because_ , *listen _it_ _never_ occurred [to] _it_ _never_ occurred [to] us [that] _it_ [would] take seven months . 
B|11| B: [you just] _like [,_ I _don't] want_ [that] person sharing [the] Earth [with] _me_ [, you _know ,] _I_ mean [,_ that] [is] [just] terrible . 
A|12| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| B: _Yeah [,_ I don't] understand [that ,] _they ,_ _they_ _don't _want_ to be_ [with] anybody _else_ . 
A|14| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: [Well [,] the] [good] stuff . _Right ._ 
A|16| A: [Yeah ,] _it_ _would [be_ a good] experience _, and_ you'd [be] helping [people] , I'm sure . Very _much ._ _And_ _and [I_ mean ,] [not] [to] _put_ , [not] [to] trivialize [the] problems [of] any immigrant group _but_ _I do_ [know] [the] Asian groups _are_ having [a lot of] trouble _. [I_ mean _,] and_ part [of the] problem _is [that_ [,] a lot of] Chinese [and] Japanese immigration from [, you know ,] decades ago has [been] _very_ successful _because_ [they] valued education _and so_ forth . 
B|17| B: [Yeah [.] _I] think_ _some_ [of] [, is] _how_ [the [,] uh [,] you _know [,] I_ guess] [it's] [not] [really] [a] direct benefit [but] _how_ _your_ [, uh ,] performance [is] rated [and] stuff _like that_ _at_ work . 
A|18| A: [but] _, I don't know ,_ methods [of] capital punishment _I have_ _no_ opinions _on_ [that] either _I just_ 
B|19| B: [Yeah .] 
A|20| A: [Yeah .] 
B|21| B: _Oh_ , yes . 
A|22| A: Maybe [a] [people] _are_ [a] little _more_ open-minded _than_ maybe _they used to be ._ 
B|23| B: _You_ [just] _say ,_ Have [a good] _day_ [or] whatever . 
A|24| A: Huh . 
B|25| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|26| A: [You] [know _,] I've_ heard [, we] [have a] couple [of] friends [that] goes [to] Washington quite often _, and_ [that] must _be the_ thing . _They_ [really] hadn't either . _They_ _went_ _to the_ Memorial [, you know _,] when_ [they] [go] [, it's] _on_ business 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: _So [,_ you know _,] it's just_ , 
B|29| B: Wild flowers . 
A|30| A: _So_ _where_ _was_ [your] last vacation ? 
B|31| B: _Oh_ , gosh [, [I] do] [not] [, [I] do] [not] _really [have_ a] list , cause [I just] kind [of] _, uh [, I_ just] [have] [all the] books [out] [, you _know ,] [I_ have] book shelves [and [I] _have] them_ [all] [out and] [usually] [when] [I] am through [with] [one] [, I] _will_ [go] [in] [and , uh [,] uh [,] uh ,] look , look through _, uh , [I_ have] [one] _now_ [and [I] , I] [can] [not] [remember] [the] name [of] [it] [that [I] [,] [that] I] _got_ _is the_ sister-in-law [in] Chicago [usually] sends _me_ [for] [my] birthday [or] , [or] Christmas _or something_ _will_ send _me_ _another_ , _another_ [good] book [and , uh [,] uh ,] 
A|32| A: Because [they ,] [of] course , _if you_ _did_ _not [have_ them] [, you] _would be_ pulling from [your] salary , [of] course . 
B|33| B: Exactly [and ,] 
A|34| A: [and] [we] [have] [to] pay [that] price _, but_ [, uh _, I] don't [know _,_ I] don't _know_ ._ _It's_ _interesting_ _, [and_ _I] think that_ nowadays [with] communications _the way_ [they] _are_ _also_ [, _that] we_ [can] _see_ global events happening _as_ _, as_ [they] occur [all] over [the] world , [like] [the ,] 
B|35| B: [Uh [,] I've] _got_ _an_ Omega [and] [I've] _got_ _a [,_ uh ,] generic _three_ eighty , [or] four eighty-six machine . 
A|36| A: [Yeah .] 
B|37| B: That'd [be the] best [way] [to be .] 
A|38| A: We wouldn't [have] [to] drive [and] spend [the] night someplace [or something] [like that] . 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: _Is_ [that] [a] nice vacation spot ? 
B|41| B: Or Dye Community . 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh [. Well [,] _I] was_ [just] reading [an] article [in] [, uh , a] North Carolina paper today _where_ [a] high [school] student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth [of] scholarships [for] herself by sitting up [at] night [and] typing [at] [, uh ,] letters [of] applications [to] universities . 
B|43| B: [And [,] uh , I] [also] [like] [to] plant flowers [and] [do] [do] _some_ gardening [and] [do] arts [and] crafts . 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] 
B|45| B: _What_ [are] [we] supposed [to] discuss again ? 
A|46| A: _Oh ._ Those aren't [too] pleasant . 
B|47| B: [And ,] [on] _a [,_ a] scale [, I guess] [it's] still considered small . It [just] [have [a] lot of] [different] laboratories . 
A|48| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|49| B: [but] [the] Texas soil isn't [the] greatest , gardening soil . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh _.] [Yeah_ .] 
B|51| B: Her eyes [are] changing , 
A|52| A: _Okay ._ [Uh ,] far _as_ [, you know ,] _crime_ [in the] cities , I'm sure , [like] [in] yours [it's] pretty , pretty bad . [Uh ,] probably [the] biggest thing we've [got] _going_ [now] [is the] robberies [and] theft [and] probably murder _are the_ two top ones _that we_ [have] . 
B|53| B: [Well [,] good] [luck] [to] _you [._ I] enjoyed [it .] 
A|54| A: [Uh ,] probably _no_ . 
B|55| B: Midnight . 
A|56| A: [Yeah .] 
B|57| B: _Right ._ 
A|58| A: [Uh _,] I would_ [say] [the] majority [of] [it's] happening during [the] [day] [, uh ,] _between_ probably ten [in the] morning [and] [three] [in the] afternoon . 
B|59| B: [I think] attitudes [are] [more] lax [now] [than] [they used to be .] 
A|60| A: My husband's mother [will] [have] major surgery [and] _we'll_ find [out] _about_ [it] [in] [a] casual conversation . She'll let [something] slip [and] _we'll_ [say ,] wait [a] minute . [And _,] and_ _that's_ [it] , she , [just] , well [I] didn't [want to] bother [you .] She _can't_ accept _that we_ [want _to be] the_ care givers . 
B|61| B: [Is] [it] [really] ? 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: [It's] [, that] [was [one] [of] the] [first] _things_ _I made_ [for] [my] husband , [because] [I was] _like [,_ um ,] yeah 
A|64| A: whispers [to] _someone_ [in the] She _had_ [another] call . She has [just] [three] kids , _eleven_ , nine _, and_ eight . 
B|65| B: [Oh] , [really] ? 
A|66| A: [Yeah .] 
B|67| B: Not [at] [the] same _time ._ 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] 
B|69| B: [So] [we] [are] [never] [, we] [never] cheer against Denver unless they're playing [the] Cowboys . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: [we] _have _,_ you know _, you_ can't_ [just] , [just] hope [for] abstinence . 
B|73| B: [and so] [. I] _found_ [that] [really] helps . 
A|74| A: Two . 
B|75| B: [Oh] , yeah . 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|77| B: [Well _,] what_ [do] _you think_ [can] [be] done [to] reduce [that] [sort of] [crime] ? 
A|78| A: Cause [I] haven't [been] there probably ... 
B|79| B: [Well ,] yeah [. [Yeah] _,] that's_ [, uh ,] yeah [, [I] think] [that's] _some_ [of] [it .] [But [,] you [know ,] [I] [have] [,] uh _, I] [, I_ [,] it's just] [the way] [, you [know ,] [I] think] society [is] _now [,_ [is] [that] we] [are] [not] [, we] [do] [not _have] the_ extensive [family] [we] [used to] . 
A|80| A: [Uh ,] [not] [a] whole [lot] [, uh] [. [I] [, I] don't] use [, I , I] seldom use anything harsher [than] seven dust [, you _know] ._ 
B|81| B: _Right ._ 
A|82| A: [so] [I made] [the] decision [to] _put_ her [in] [a] nursing home _, and_ [my] sister being _on the_ other end [found] [one] [that] she could [have] [what] [was] called [an] independent living facility . She _had_ her _own_ little room [and] didn't [have] [to] share [it] [with] anyone [and] could bring [in] her _own_ chair [and] T V set 
B|83| B: [Okay .] Bye-bye . 
A|84| A: _Oh ._ 
B|85| B: Yes . Ever [, you can't] even [, when] [I was] [a] kid [, I would] run [between] [my] neighbors , [three] [and] four blocks [sometimes] _, and [,_ as] long [as] [my] mom _had a_ general idea [where] [I was] [and [I] was] _back_ [on the] [time ,] 
A|86| A: [Yeah [.] [Yeah] .] 
B|87| B: [Yeah .] 
A|88| A: [Right] , 
B|89| B: [Yeah ,] [no] [, that] [would be] _, what_ [did] [they] [do] , everyone _come_ around [and] watch [them] . 
A|90| A: [Yeah ,] [so] [, uh [,] what] [are] [your] favorite T V shows ? 
B|91| B: [So [,] we] [used to] [go] [and] listen [to] [them] [all the] [time] [and [,] my] parents still [do] . 
A|92| A: [You] hate [to] [have the] dubious honor [of] being [, you know ,] [so] high [in [the] ,] [in] statistics , 
B|93| B: [I don't know] _how_ [much] [I] [know] [about] [this] subject 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] [What] [, what] deterrent _does_ he [really have] ? 
B|95| B: [And] [the] [people] I'd most likely [want to] sentence [to] death [are the] [people] [that] [just] show [a] [really] low regard [for] human life . That [, you know , you] , [never] [know] [when] they're [going to] turn [or] hurt [the] _next_ person [because] [it] doesn't [really] matter [to] [them] whether [someone] _else_ [gets] hurt [or] [not] . 
A|96| A: he said _that , uh ,_ Aikman [was] hitting him right [on the] numbers every [time _.] So ,_ sounds [like] [he's] _going to be_ [all] right [for] [next] season . They're [just] trying [not] [to] overwork him right [now ,] until he [gets] his shoulder [, uh ,] [back] [in] [it] [was] his shoulder , wasn't [it] [, that] he [had] [the] problems [with] ? 
B|97| B: [Oh] [, it's] [very] difficult [I] [know .] 
A|98| A: [and , uh ,] otherwise , [of] course [my] husband's into [the] football 
B|99| B: [But] [when it] comes [to] [what] kind [of] sentence _you're_ [going to] lay down [, [I] think [that] , uh [,] that] [they] should . 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] 
B|101| B: [I think] [one [of] the] _things_ [that's] [interesting] [to] _me_ [is] [if you] look particularly [at] [the] political changes [is that] [the ,] [they] seem [to be] social , [they] seem [to be] economically driven [also] . 
A|102| A: Wow . 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [Well [,] we] haven't [really] heard [that] [much] [in the] news lately , _about [,_ uh ,] U S involvement [in] Latin America , since [, uh ,] [all] [this] Middle East crisis began _. So_ [I] haven't [really] paid [that] [much] attention [like ,] since [back] [in] August [when] [all] [of the] news [and] [all] [of the] media began [to] focus [in] [on] [, uh ,] Iraq [, and [,] [the] ,] [so] [the] last thing [that I] [remember] hearing [that] [much] [about] [is the] Iran Contra scandal [that] happened [in the] Reagan presidency . Can [you think] [of] anything [else] [that's] happened recently ? 
B|105| B: [and] [what] [we] [found] [, uh _,] [to_ be the] best guide [was] _our_ [own] instincts [about ,] [people] _who_ [were] [going to be] loving 
A|106| A: [Right .] 
B|107| B: [And] [I don't] [think [that] [,] that] rehabilitation [is] effective . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [They] [never] [go] [to] [see] [them] . 
A|110| A: [Uh [,] and] [just] [a lot of] [things] [I've] learned [off] [of] her [that [,] to] start doing . [And] she _does_ make [a lot of] sense . 
B|111| B: [So] [we'll] slowly learn [just] [to] type here [and] [then] [then] [put] [the] story [in .] 
A|112| A: [Yeah ,] [so] [it's] [been] [good] [for] [our] [family] . 
B|113| B: [Yeah .] 
A|114| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: [Really .] Um [, a lot of] places [that] even [don't] look , [don't] look [like] [much .] 
A|116| A: [I] [want to] believe [they] [go] into other countries [and] teach [them] [how] [to] [do] [things] [like] farm [, uh ,] dig their [own] wells , set up , their schools . 
B|117| B: [Uh-huh .] [Right .] 
A|118| A: [I] [like] [the] Moody Blues . Did _you like_ [them] ? 
B|119| B: [Oh .] 
A|120| A: [I] [had a] friend [in] [I] [had a] friend [in] college [who] [had [a] [,] um ,] [had a] pet rat [for a] while . 
B|121| B: [Oh] [, you] [get] [that] stuff [in the] mail [all the] [time .] 
A|122| A: [You] [don't want] [the] government [to] spend [your] money . [You] [want to be] able , 
B|123| B: [They] , [they [,] that] [just] [does] [not] [go] . 
A|124| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|125| B: [Right [.] I] [know .] 
A|126| A: [Uh [,] I [,] uh ,] [some] nights his mother calls [me] [and] says [can] [your] [family] [, and] [just] bring [the] kids [in the] [family] [and] [just] [come] over [and [,] and] visit grandma [because] she [gets] [very] disoriented . 
B|127| B: [Uh-huh [.] So] [you like] [a [,] a] variety . 
A|128| A: [Well [,] that's] [good] . Sounds [like] [you're] , [have a] handle [on] [it .] 
B|129| B: [Oh] , okay [. So [,] but] [um ,] [now [,] I don't know [,] but] [um [,] but] let's [see [,] when] [I was] [eleven] [I] [went] [also] [to the] Caribbean .
