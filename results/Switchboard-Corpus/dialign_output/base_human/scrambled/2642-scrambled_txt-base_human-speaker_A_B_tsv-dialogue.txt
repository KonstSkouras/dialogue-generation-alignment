Now I've [learned] [to] [do] [that] 
B|29| B: _And that_ [was] _real_ nice [. Uh ,] 
A|30| A: [uh [,] really] [haven't had] [a] [whole] [lot of] _time_ [to] get _out_ [to] [see] [the] movies lately . 
B|31| B: [And] [it's] , Well [, they] certainly [are] living off our _at_ our expense . 
A|32| A: Is [it] , _that's_ [good] . 
B|33| B: Well , [it] will _take_ [you] _a little_ while but you'll _probably_ always _have_ [a] soft spot [in] [your] heart though [for] [for] Denver . 
A|34| A: So , _what_ _kind [of_ a] [house] [do you] live [in] ? 
B|35| B: [Uh ,] yeah , although she _is , uh ,_ [in] pretty [good] health [and] she's , doesn't _take_ any medication , [it's just] she [had] [had] _her_ [own] apartment [and] drove [a] car [and] [everything] up _until_ [that] point . 
A|36| A: married ? 
B|37| B: _Uh-huh ,_ yeah . 
A|38| A: Now [how] [do you] _mean_ [that] ? [I know] [it] , 
B|39| B: _And , uh ,_ [or] [they] fool [the] [, the] defense [in] thinking [that] [they're] [, you know [,] [because] [when] they] [go] through those processes [they] [kind of] pick [out] _who_ [they] want . 
A|40| A: [Right] [, we] [have] _enough_ , _enough_ _problems_ [with] overcrowding [in the] jails as [it [is] .] So let , let their country [take] care [of] [it .] 
B|41| B: [Yeah ,] yeah [, I , I] use [that] [for] [for] rice [and] [for] [when] [I] cook pasta [or something] , I'll put _a little_ bit [of] bouillon [in] [there] [just] [to] give [it] _a little_ extra flavor . 
A|42| A: [so] I'm [kind of] ready [for] [the] pumpkin weather . 
B|43| B: Well _, [when_ you] start early [, I] guess , 
A|44| A: [and] [he] goes [out] [and] commits [it] again . Fact _, he's_ [back] [in] jail now . So , _what_ , _what_ [, uh ,] 
B|45| B: Huh [that's] , 
A|46| A: [Yeah [,] I] [agree] [, I ,] I've [, I] _have , uh _,_ a_ low tolerance [for] [that] [kind [of] , uh ,] [that] [kind of] person [. [And] , uh ,] as _far_ as [, uh [,] you know] [there] [are] [some] , [some] other crimes [that] [I think] [, uh [,] you know [,] uh ,] kidnapping [, um [,] you know [,] [when] [they] [,] _I] mean_ kidnapping per se has [a] certain [, uh [,] uh ,] fine [and] [penalty] associated [with] [it] , 
B|47| B: [Yeah ,] but _at the_ same [time] [, I don't [know] ,] [it's] pretty [far] [to] throw [that] [far] [I] couldn't [do] [it .] 
A|48| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|49| B: [Yeah .] 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh [,] and] [the] skunk . 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [I] [just] [don't know] [and] now [they _have] [,_ like] bins [and] stuff [that are] [a little] [more] convenient [because] , _mean ,_ [until] seven o'clock [, you] got [to] [pay] [to] park [at the] student center [, you] can't [really] unload [all] [your] stuff . 
B|53| B: Okay , nice speaking [to you] . 
A|54| A: [Yeah [,] you] [do] [a lot] [more] [area] than [I] [do] . I've , [all] [the] rest [of] [my] yard , backyard [is , uh [,] you know ,] pool [and] decking [it's] [all] [the] dirt [I] _have ,_ left [in] [my] backyard 
B|55| B: [Right [.] And] [you know [,] if] [I , I] didn't wait [five] years [for] [it] [to be] [good] [enough] grow [you know] [what] [I mean] 
A|56| A: [And that] [really] helped [us] [out] [a] great deal . So [. But] [my] husband does get vacation [and it's] worked [out] [really] [good for] [us] [too] . 
B|57| B: We [just] lived up [there] . 
A|58| A: [and] [we] can't [see] [her] often [enough] [to] [really] [know] what's going [on] . 
B|59| B: [Do] [they] wind up [with] [more] red tape [, and] [more] [problems] _then ?_ [Yeah ,] yeah . 
A|60| A: no . I'm [not] [real] familiar [with] [that] . 
B|61| B: [uh ,] father's . My mother's father's _family_ [had] [quite] [a few] [, uh ,] brothers [and] sisters . 
A|62| A: Are [you] going [to] move [your whole] [family] over [there] [then ?] 
B|63| B: It [was] nice talking [to you] . 
A|64| A: [Yeah] [and] [how] [Yeah] [how] it'll sway from [one] [one] extreme [to] another . 
B|65| B: Pardon ? 
A|66| A: [And] [how] [is] [it really] transmitted , et cetera . 
B|67| B: [Really] ? 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|69| B: Also [, for] working women [uh , I think] [a [lot] of] [the] companies should start providing [for] day-care [in the] , [in the] , [in the] building . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| B: [I mean [,] you know [,] I] remember , [well] , [just] [the] things [that are] covered [. I] remember [watching] [the] World Series [during the] earthquake [, and] [just] seeing [that] happen 
A|72| A: [Yeah [.] And I think] [that's] [almost] [a] bigger factor , than anything else [probably] [. [I] mean [,] I don't] [, I think] [you know ,] [people] [just] , 
B|73| B: [Right .] My [middle] child needs [to] [have , uh ,] orthodontic [, he's] [because] his , his pallet [is] squared , [not] rounded . 
A|74| A: [Oh] . 
B|75| B: Wow . Wow . That's [a] [, a] big job . 
A|76| A: [Uh [,] I] [have] him [take] from [a] friend [of] mine [who] teaches Suzuki . Which [is] [an] auditory type learning experience .
