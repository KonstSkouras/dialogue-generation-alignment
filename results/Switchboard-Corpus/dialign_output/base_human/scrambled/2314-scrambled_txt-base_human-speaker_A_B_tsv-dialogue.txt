B|25| B: [So ,] five bedrooms [and] [two] living , [two] family 
A|26| A: [Yeah ,] [that's] _, I mean_ [that's] certainly [a] possibility _in ,_ _in [,_ we have] [had _a] few_ cases where [the] guy _has_ broken _in [,_ you know ,] during [the] middle [of the] night [and] gotten himself shot [to] death . 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: _but_ [, uh _, I] don't know_ [I think] everybody [would] feel _it is_ _same_ way [if] [they were] touched _by_ _crime_ [. [I] think] everyone _would [,_ you] [and _I] think are_ honest [and] candid [because] [we] _could_ _do it_ _on_ , [in] this , vehicle [, uh ,] 
B|29| B: Yep . [Oh] 
A|30| A: _I mean_ she actually asks _to go_ _out_ .

B|35| B: That's _right_ [.

A|36| A: _so_ [, we] [had] _to [,_ we] [had] [to] flea bath them _and it_ [was] _, uh , it_ [was] _an_ experience [that they] didn't enjoy [at] _all ._ 
B|37| B: You're kidding . 
A|38| A: Ooh , [that] [would be] nice . 
B|39| B: [Yeah] . 
A|40| A: [Oh ,] [that's] _good_ . 
B|41| B: [Okay] [, well] [we] [are] [in] south Garland [, but] [yeah ,] next [time] [you] [go] [, uh [,] you know ,] check into [it ,] _they have_ [, uh , [it] is] [just] _like [,_ uh _,] a_ bus card _and they_ [just] punch [it [.] You know , it] [has] [got] _one_ through [ten] [on] [it] [and] every [time] [you] [go] [they] [just] punch [it for] [you] . 
A|42| A: _Um [,_ but] [we] [, um [,] we] house sat [for] [a [,] um ,] [my] [, um ,] [my] wife's boss [a] couple weeks ago [and [,] um [,] uh ,] he [has] [a] dog [and] everything [, we] [were [,] you know [,] we] [were] sitting [the] dog [and] everything [and , uh , I] felt [like] [just] miserable _all_ weekend _and it_ [really] didn't dawn [on] me until Sunday [, it] [was] [like ,] hey _, maybe_ you're [still] allergic [to] [the] dog . [It] [was] [like ,] oh , [that] [could] [be] [it .] 
B|43| B: Hi [, well _,] I guess_ _, which_ _one_ [have] [you] [got] _right_ [now] ? Or , 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh _.] Yeah_ [but] [, you know [,] we] [do] everything together . 
B|45| B: The petroleum pretty [much] [, I mean] , those petroleum products [I think are] [the] big [, uh [,] you know] [the] great Satan [of the] recycling . 
A|46| A: _Well , I_ am _new_ [to] Texas , _so_ [I don't] [even] [know] [what] [the] law _is ,_ [in the] [state] , 
B|47| B: [I] [really] [don't] [think] [so] [. Yeah] [. I] [really] [don't] [because ,] _some_ [people] [are] going [to _,] are , are_ going [to] risk [it [,] um , it may] prevent _, I _,_ I guess_ _, I guess_ [what] [I'm] trying [to get] [at] [is ,] [if] [it ,] [if] [it ,] [if] [it] does help [a few] individuals [maybe] [, maybe] [it's] worth [it .] 
A|48| A: [It] [really] [is] . 
B|49| B: [and] [we] subcontracted [it] [out] ourselves . We bought [the] [lot] [and , uh ,] [had] [an] architect _draw the_ plans based [on] _our_ specifications 
A|50| A: [I don't , [I don't] , [I don't] [, [I] think] that] [it] should _be [,_ I mean] [if] [it's] beyond [a] doubt [that] someone [did] premeditate someone [, a] murder , _then_ [I _think] [,_ you know ,] [that they] should likewise [, you know ,] someone should _take_ [their] life also . _But_ [, uh [,] but] [, are , are] [you] , [would] [you] [draw the] line [there] with [just] [the] premeditated murder ? 
B|51| B: [Oh] [really] ? 
A|52| A: [So [I] guess] we've [kind of] neglected Latin America . 
B|53| B: [Yeah] . 
A|54| A: Nancy , [that's] [right] , 
B|55| B: [But] [just] [enough] [that] his bite [is] off [a little bit] [and] [it's] [like] _four_ hundred dollars [, and] [my] insurance [is] only going [to] cover [like] fifty [of it .] 
A|56| A: [and ,] [So ,] 
B|57| B: A whole [new] world . [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|59| B: [and] [my] mom [has] [to] [take] care [of] her pretty [much] [so] [it] gets [, _I don't know] [._ It's] [, it's] [a] hard decision [, but [I] don't] [think] [I] [would do it] [to] [my] _parents_ personally 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [It's] always [have] [to] [have] [it] [now] . 
A|62| A: uh-huh . 
B|63| B: Is [that] [right] ? 
A|64| A: [Oh ,] sure . 
B|65| B: [And] [, uh] . The thing _about [it_ [,] you know ,] [now] [that] [I've] found _, _is_ that_ [we] [get] such [good] coverage [on] [T V] _, or_ [at] least such [, I don't [know] ,] attempted thoroughness [of] coverage [, by] [the] [time] [you] [get the] TIME MAGAZINE , there's nothing [in] [it] [you] _don't know ._ 
A|66| A: About fifteen miles [. I] live [in] [a little] suburb [, uh [,] which [is] [,] I guess] [from] Dallas [is] twelve miles [or] [so] 
B|67| B: [So _I] ,_ [like] [I've] picked up [now] [a] subscription [to] _one_ [of the] travel agent [, uh ,] organization magazines [and] [it's] [a] ridiculous difference when [you] start reading [from] [their] perspective . Uh [, you know ,] [their] major interest _is in_ commissions [and , you know ,] there's very [little] talk [about] [the] quality [of] places [or] airlines . Their major talk [is] [about] [, you know ,] commissions [and] commission rebates [and] _how_ [they] won't suggest hotels [to] [people] [if] [the] commission's _not_ [a [,] the] full [ten] percent [or] whatever [it is] [and it] gives [you] [a] different perspective [on] [what] [people] [do] . 
A|68| A: [I [know ,] I] [do] [too] [, I ,] most [of] [my] [friends] [have] three [or] [four] kids [and they] feel [like [,] you know ,] [that's] [really] why God [and] [some] [of [the] people] [in] [our] church use birth control [and] [some] [of] them [don't , I] [had] [my] tubes tied [so] [you] , 
B|69| B: [It's] [a] [two] story colonial [, which] [my] wife [and I] designed . 
A|70| A: [Yeah [,] and] [is that] [how] your [parents] feel [or] , 
B|71| B: [Um [,] I [,] I] understand [that] [it's] being proposed as [a] requirement , [for , uh ,] young [people] [to] [be ,] [to go] into public service . 
A|72| A: [I'm] [not] sure [what] [it is] [there] . Now [, I know] [what] [it [is] in] Singapore [, is] [they [have] the] death penalty [and they] [really] enforce [it ,] 
B|73| B: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
A|74| A: [I've] tried [to do] [is] [get] this outfit [to] give me [one] 
B|75| B: [Well [, I] know] up [in] Connecticut [the] [same] thing happened , [people] [are] devastated [because] [they] paid [so] [much] [for] [their] home . 
A|76| A: [but] [now] [, you know , you] [wouldn't] probably read [about it] [here] [in] Texas 
B|77| B: [Yeah [,] you] [think [,] well [,] I don't] [have] [it] [now] [but] payday will come [and] [then] I'll [have the] [money .] 
A|78| A: [I think] [you] couldn't make [it] with [a] hand whisk [or] [, or] [a] regular beater [but] [, um ,] 
B|79| B: no [there] isn't [the] harsh [crime] [and] [all .] 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|81| B: _What_ [about] [the] [, the] work effort those [ten] [people] [did] when [the] company [was] [doing] [well] . 
A|82| A: [I don't know .] [What] [are] your [, uh ,] [what] sorts [of] [things] [would] [you] consider important ?
