B|31| B: Huh . 
A|32| A: _Yeah _._ Well_ _it's_ _that they_ [I _think] the_ idea [of] _freedom of_ speech goes [back] [to] [and I] [uh] [uh] [the] [the] [the] whole aspect [of] _being_ able [to] display _your_ [uh] _your_ ideas [you know] [the] [what] [the] country stands [on] America stands [on] _is_ _that they_ _can_ _do_ [that] [Uh] , though [I] [would] never even consider [it] [in] [a] million [years] _to do_ [it] _myself_ _I _I_ [I_ think] [uh] [you know] _but_ _I I_ still [what] [the] flag stands [for] [I] guess [to] [me] _is_ [that] _if_ somebody wants [to] voice their opinion _or_ display their opinion openly [and] _if_ [that] _is_ [a] [a] way _that they_ _can_ show their opinion then [they] _should_ [be] allowed [uh]

A|34| A: _Right ._

A|42| A: okay . 
B|43| B: No [, I don't] _. _I_ [have_ a] friend , [of] [mine] told [me] [about] [this] program , [is] [the] reason [that] [I'm] , 
A|44| A: _sure ._ _Yeah ._ 
B|45| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|46| A: [Yeah ,] well _, a_ cat will _do_ [the] same trick 
B|47| B: I've done [a lot of] electrical [and] plumbing [and] other _work_ [that ,] [by] [myself] [and] saved [a lot of] [money] [that] [I] couldn't [have] done [if] [the] house _was_ [on] [a] slab . 
A|48| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|49| B: [Well , it's] carbon _so that_ makes _sense_ , _like a_ carbon fuel [of] [some] sort [, but] [what] _what about_ emissions ? 
A|50| A: _That's_ true . 
B|51| B: It's [a] farm community [, and] [we] . 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh , uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [Yeah ,] [that's] _not_ [too] far from were [we] live , [do] [you have] [, you] [said] [you] [had] [two] cats , [are] [they] [, um [,] just] _what you_ call _it ,_ [are] [they] breed cats [or] _anything_ [or] [are] [they] _just ,_ 
A|54| A: _Right [,_ and] try [to] determine [if] [what you] read [was] objective [or] [not] . 
B|55| B: Make [sure] [we] _get_ [our] cash flow . 
A|56| A: _Yeah ._ _Yeah ._ _Yeah ._ 
B|57| B: [Oh [,] yeah .] 
A|58| A: [but] [it's] uncomfortable 
B|59| B: [Oh] . [Right [,] _that] would be_ devastating [I'm sure] [so .] 
A|60| A: [I] mean [you] _can_ [just] sit [, you know] _those_ little booklets [that] _come_ along _with_ [it] 
B|61| B: [I ,] I've , [one] thing , when , when _I have_ run [and] jogged [, uh ,] I've always enjoyed doing [it] [by] [myself] [and [,] [and] ,] [not] [with] [the] _sense_ [that] _it was_ [, uh [,] uh ,] chore [or something] [that] [I] [was] _having [to_ _do] [,_ [I] ,] I've [really] enjoyed [just the] activity [and , uh [,] I] write software [, uh ,] as far as [the] job [and] [so] getting [out] [and] [being] active [, uh ,] _is [,_ uh [,] uh ,] helps _out ._ _The_ [, it's] 
A|62| A: Do [you know] how [to] spell _it ?_ 
B|63| B: [And] especially when [the] weather's [not] [too] hot [or] , [not] raining [or] whatever , 
A|64| A: [Oh] [yeah] , _there's_ , 
B|65| B: Bye-bye . 
A|66| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|67| B: [That's] [the] hard part , right ? 
A|68| A: [Uh-huh .] [And] sometimes [the , the] help there does [it , I think] . 
B|69| B: [so _.] I_ named her Rosebud [, [and] , uh [,] a] friend [of] [mine] [said ,] she [, that] she [this] friend [of] [mine] grew [up] [on] [a] farm [and] [said] [that] she [had [,] uh [,] a] pet cow named Rosebud [and] she [said] [there's] [a lot of] longevity [in] [that] name , [said] [my] cow lived seventeen [years] 
A|70| A: Yes [. [I] think we] ought [to] worry [about] [our] own species . 
B|71| B: That [, that] half [the] fun [is] finding [out] [what] [all] [the] products [are] . 
A|72| A: _But ,_ well [that's] [all] _I can_ [really] [think] [about] [for] recycling . 
B|73| B: [because] we're [so] _, we_ [love] [our] [freedom] [and] [our] [freedom of] choice [and [,] um ,] _having_ [people] [like] 
A|74| A: [Oh ,] [he] [was] [found guilty] [, yeah .] 
B|75| B: [Oh ,] [is] [he] [the] reformed [, um ,] gambler ? 
A|76| A: [so .] 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [The] rest [of] [it] [is] [just] [like] wild flowers 
B|79| B: No . No , [not] _at_ [all] . 
A|80| A: [Uh-huh [,] and] [it] [just] pertained [to] [that] 
B|81| B: _And that ,_ [that's] [a] deterrent , [too .] If [you] [think the] _home_ owner [might be] armed , right [, and] awake 
A|82| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|83| B: [Right .] [Oh [,] it's] tough [I'm [sure] .] 
A|84| A: [And that [,] what] [I think] [is] [going [to] be] [really] interesting [is] [what] [we] [do] [about] [it] [. I] mean [, we] [are] [going [to] have] [to] change [the] [people] [who] represent us . 
B|85| B: [Yeah .] 
A|86| A: [Yeah] [that would be] [a] _good_ idea . 
B|87| B: [Well [,] you know] 
A|88| A: Okay , well [, [it] was] _good_ talking [to] [you] [and] [have a] _good_ evening . 
B|89| B: Um . Now [that would be] [good] . 
A|90| A: [you] _want_ [to] , [Yeah .] They'll let [you] [work] , decrease _your_ number [of] hours [by] [any] percentage [just [,] just] [about] [so] [if] [you] _want_ [to get] _your_ masters [and] then [, I think] [of] course [you get] _like a ,_ [with] _your_ extra degrees [you get] [a] pay raise due [so that] will probably help [out .] 
B|91| B: [Uh] . 
A|92| A: [yeah .] 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|94| A: [And] [they] laughed [at] [me [,] they] thought [that] [was] [so] hysterical . 
B|95| B: [Yeah .] 
A|96| A: So [, I don't] [, I don't] even [know] [who] _your_ favorite team [is ,] [actually] . 
B|97| B: Huh [. Well [,] you] [would] [think [that] they] [would] [get] [that] [in] [the [,] uh ,] when [the] prosecution [and] defense [are] choosing [the] jury [you] [would] [think that] [those] [would] [come] [out] [and [I] [,] [I] know] [they] automatically , when [you] go through [, uh ,] when you're chosen [is ,] you're automatically [like [a ,] [a] , a] professor [in] criminal justice [or something] [like _that] , that_ you're automatically , no [they] [don't] [want] [you] [on] [the] jury . 
A|98| A: Every time [you] , They [could] buy their way [out .] 
B|99| B: [And , uh [,] it's] [, it's] tragic [that [,] you know ,] when [people] live [so] long [that they] [, uh ,] _don't [have_ a] _really don't [have_ a] place [to] go . 
A|100| A: [Yeah .] 
B|101| B: [Yeah [,] uh [,] that] makes [a] difference _doesn't_ [it ?] 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [I have] [two] . 
B|105| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [Yeah ,] over uncooked rice 
B|107| B: Are [you] _having_ [any] trouble [with] bugs [in] [, in] [your] garden ? 
A|108| A: [and] each [, uh ,] [home] does participate [but] [we] [really don't have] [anything] [, uh ,] close [in] [this] area [that , that] [do] [anything] . [And [,] and] [some] [of] [the] communities [that] [do [,] the] residents [are] [having to] pay [to] participate [in] [it] . Which [really] [doesn't] make [sense] . 
B|109| B: [and I] [was] [in] , [like] , chamber music groups [and] stuff , [so] [I'm] [used] [to] pieces [and [,] and I] played classical flute [, I] didn't play , play jazz flute [or] [anything] [like [that] ,] [so [.] [I] [I] can] relate [to] [it , I] suppose [But [,] uh [, and] I] [like] [, I'm] [like] [you] [I] [like] [the] older stuff , [too ,] [because] [I] [like] Chicago 
A|110| A: [Well , what about] random testing , though .
