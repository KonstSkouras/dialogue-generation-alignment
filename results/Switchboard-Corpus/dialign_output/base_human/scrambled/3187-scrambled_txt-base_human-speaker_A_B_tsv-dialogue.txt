A|20| A: Yes . 
B|21| B: _Well [,_ _I] think that's_ true [, and] _I [,_ uh ,] [now] [we] generally _don't_ buy [a] warranty _, because_ _you think_ [, you know [,] at] least _for the_ first couple [of] [years ,] nothing should go wrong [with it] . 
A|22| A: But [they] seem _to like_ [it] okay . [I think] they're too far away _from_ me [, but] maybe some _day_ [they] [can] get closer , 
B|23| B: [Yeah .] 
A|24| A: [but] [Yeah .] [but] [it] [that's] [uh] [that's] _what_ [I] mean , see [, but] [but] realistically [when] [you think] [of] [it] [it] [just] sounds [like] such an awful [thing] [, and] [it] evokes an emotional response . [I [think that's] the] hardest [thing] [, I don't] [know] [if] [I] could ever [be a] judge [, because] some things emotionally [just] aren't [you know] 
B|25| B: [Yeah .] Our cat [we] _got_ [from] [the] pound [the] [day] [the] night _she_ was [going to] [be] put [to] sleep . So [that's] why [we] call _her_ Liberty . 
A|26| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|27| B: _And_ then people would , would [know] [that] [it] was [going to] cost [them] money [to] _not_ sort _their_ trash . 
A|28| A: [and] so [, but] [, uh ,] [she] [got] over _it ,_ so . 
B|29| B: So [I] guess [it's] supposed [to] [be] dinner party , [is] [that] [what] [they] said ? 
A|30| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] That's kind [of] [a] , let down . 
B|31| B: If [it ,] 
A|32| A: [and] [they] buried [her] alive 
B|33| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|34| A: Um . [Well ,] [here] [, uh ,] I'm [not] sure how many Dallas has had . I've [, uh ,] Houston [is] averaging [about] two [a] week or three or four [, [I] [,] I don't] [know] . A , [a] number [every] week . 
B|35| B: [Right] [, the] child will learn [to like] cats . [and] deal [with] [them] , 
A|36| A: [And] [, uh [,] and] yet [if you] didn't feel [like] [you] could [be a] good caretaker [I don't] [, uh [,] it's] [a] [very] , [very] hard decision [I think] . 
B|37| B: They [got] [that , uh ,] [what] [is] [that] safer soap [, uh ,] B T spray [this] , year . 
A|38| A: But there's , there's some where [, uh [,] uh ,] student employees working [for the] government [don't] [have to] pay Social Security tax . [that's] [about] , five percent [right] there 
B|39| B: [Yeah .] 
A|40| A: Of course , [their] seasons are switched . 
B|41| B: Does [your] family normally [have] [a] reunion ? Do [you] [have] one , 
A|42| A: But [I] [have] fun [doing [it] ,] some [, uh [,] you know [,] I] [have] some good shots [and] some bad shots .
