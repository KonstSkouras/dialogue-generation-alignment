B|3| B: That's great .

B|9| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|11| B: _Oh _,_ is_ [that] right ?

B|23| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: _I think_ [it _was] just_ rare [, I] [really] _do ._

B|27| B: _Right ._ 
A|28| A: Baseball has _started_ . 
B|29| B: [Yeah [,] my] [, my] father [was] raising four oh _well ,_ three [kids] [before] [he] _had_ me _, so_ [it was] [, uh , you know ,] you're trying [, to] support [, uh ,] four [kids] [, and] [it's] _pretty_ hard [you know ,] 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh] , [uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [they] _always_ [do .] 
A|32| A: [Yeah ,] [Right .] 
B|33| B: [Well] let me ask [you] _this_ _then_ . 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|35| B: [I mean [,] [it's] a] [it's a] [scary] world [out] [there] anymore , where [your] afraid [to] [go] [out ,] 
A|36| A: _Well ,_ since [you] live close [, I] don't [know] _if_ [you know _,] um ,_ _about_ _what_ Louisville [is] doing with recycling , [or] _are_ [you] familiar with any [of] [that] ? 
B|37| B: [Oh [,] [I] [know] .] 
A|38| A: _and _I_ have_ [not] [had] _to use_ _the heat ._ 
B|39| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|40| A: Sounds _like_ [you] _have a_ little _one_ [just] _like _I_ do_ 
B|41| B: [Yeah .] 
A|42| A: _Well [,_ I] [had] never [been] [there] [, that's] [pretty] neat . My sisters both seem [to] _like_ [it] [pretty] [well] . My brother-in-law works _for_ [the] University _, um _,_ in_ Dallas . He's admissions director _. Uh_ . University [of] Texas [in] Dallas . 
B|43| B: [Yeah [.] _I] have [a_ lot _of] _, uh ,_ uh ,_ computer books _that I_ am [, [I] do] computer [work] [and] _so_ _I have [a_ lot of] those . [So] [, _I] [spend_ a lot of time] _looking_ [through] those [, not] necessarily reading _them_ _but ,_ _looking_ [through] _them_ . 
A|44| A: Like _, what_ _is a_ book _on_ [your] list [, you know] [I have a] list _too_ _and [I_ have] never gotten [to] [it] 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah [,] that's] [kind of] _like ,_ [like] [a] Victorian style ? 
A|46| A: _Well [,_ and] [that's] _an_ individual _thing ._ 
B|47| B: [Uh [,] no] [, not] _actually_ 
A|48| A: _Well [,_ I] [just] , 
B|49| B: _But _,_ but_ _then_ [it's] _something_ [that's] hard [to] enforce [too] _I'm_ sure . 
A|50| A: [But _,] um [,_ it] _seems like_ people [just] [, you know _,] they_ [just] _think _,_ well [,_ I] can [just] [have] anything _I want_ _. And_ [I] [just] don't [see] [it] _like [that_ .] Of course [, I] [always] [see] pay [the] bills first [and] whatever's leftover [, that's] _what you_ [have] [, [but] _,] um ,_ _maybe [a_ lot of] people don't [see] [it] _like [that_ [,] but] [I] can't stand owing [. [I] mean [,] I] cannot fully tolerate [to] owe [something] _like [, you know ,_ I] guess _it's just_ [because] _I've_ [been] _brought_ _up_ _like [that_ .] [But _,] um [,_ I] could [not] charge [to] [the] limit [and] knowing [that I] [was] _going to_ [have] [to] pay _this thing_ [out] _for_ ever [and] _maybe_ suffer from having [to] payout . [But [,] that's] [just] [the] _way_ [I] feel _about_ _it ._ 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: Forgot _about_ [that .] 
B|53| B: [Yeah .] [So] _, that is_ [pretty] much [for] right _now_ _, that _is_ [,_ what] [I [have] been] reading . 
A|54| A: [But [,] uh [,] that [is] the] only [time] _I think_ [I have] ever [really] taken golf lessons [and] [that _was] kind _of_ a_ group scenario [and] [not] individual . 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [And] [that's] [the] best [place] [that] _I've_ ever canoed . 
B|57| B: [So] _now the_ tickets even _got_ lower than [the] lowest [one] last year . 
A|58| A: _and [I_ spend] enough [time] chatting around everywhere [, you know] 
B|59| B: _I'm_ _so_ sorry . 
A|60| A: [I mean] [you] [, you] hear [of] people who [have] _, um ,_ committed crimes [, _and] then_ _they get_ _out of_ jail [and] [they] [go] [, and] [they] [do] [the] same [thing] _again ._ 
B|61| B: [Right [.] Yeah [,] [I] _know] [what_ you] [mean] 
A|62| A: _Well ,_ _yeah [,_ it's] [, uh [,] it's] [, uh [,] it's] [, uh ,] there's [, uh ,] there's pluses [to] everything , 
B|63| B: [I] [like] [the heat .] 
A|64| A: _And _,_ um ,_ [I'm] [a] writer by profession [and] [my] daughter enjoys writing [too] [, so] [a lot of] _times_ , she _and I_ will travel [to] writers conferences together . 
B|65| B: [Oh ,] okay . [Right [.] [Uh] ,] 
A|66| A: [Uh [,] and] _we're_ beginning [to] [see] [more] [and] [more] [of] [that .] 
B|67| B: New York . 
A|68| A: [the] first [one] [I] [got] . [He] jumped off [the] balcony [actually] , _of a_ second story apartment . 
B|69| B: [Uh ,] [I've] [done] business programming [, you know ,] scientific applications [like , you know ,] petroleum science stuff _and ,_ [Uh [,] uh ,] test equipment [and I] did [the] [, I , I] did [one] [that was] , [the] demonstration [of a] touch , touch screen [for] [a] company [that] sells [, uh ,] touch screens [. It] [was kind of] fun . 
A|70| A: [Right .] _Well [,_ I , I] guess [I] [just] [have] [not] _read_ [I mean ,] _usually_ [, I] [just] , _if_ [I] find [a] _good_ book [, I] will sit [, you know _,] _for_ two_ [days] until [it] [is] finished _. If_ [it's] [that] _good_ , 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: _It's_ [not] [the] law abiding citizen [that [,] you know [,] [is] [,] is] dangerous with [the] gun _It's_ _the ones that are_ _going_ [out] [and] stealing _it ._ 
B|73| B: Have , [have] [you] [been] [out [of] the] country ? 
A|74| A: Um , there's [been] tremendous amounts [of ,] [of , uh ,] layoffs [so] _, really_ housing [is] real bad . The economy itself around _here_ [is] [not] [too] terribly bad [, but] housing [is] still real bad 
B|75| B: We [were] using baby _food_ [and] _there was_ [so] many baby _food_ jars , [kind of] [what] [started] [it .] 
A|76| A: [And] _we_ [got] [a few] [, you know ,] _we_ put _up_ _some_ hummingbird feeders [and] _some_ bird feeders . 
B|77| B: When [you] [get] [one] [way] [out] [like that] [but] [then] [really] _doesn't_ wind [up] penalizing [the] [person] _that they_ _went_ [after] . Who [it] [really] penalizes [is] their insurance company which [then] translates into higher rates [for] _all_ [of] us [. If [they] get] [some] [of] those mega awards against _them_ . 
A|78| A: [Oh] _yeah_ . 
B|79| B: Exactly , 
A|80| A: Because they're , _Well _,_ _they_ have_ lunch specials [that] [you] can't [, you] can't beat [that] price [, uh ,] _if_ [you] [went] _to a_ cafeteria . 
B|81| B: [Right .] 
A|82| A: [you] [, you] [see] somebody's mini series [and] [you] hear _about_ somebody's crime _, [there_ was] [something] _on_ [, and] [this] gets _back to_ capital punishment [, but] [the man] [had] stolen [, uh [,] not] stolen [but] kidnapped [, uh ,] [some] wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere _in Florida_ [and] [they] changed [all] [the] facts [that they] said [it was] true 
B|83| B: [But] _now_ [that] [my] [, my] [, uh ,] youngest sister's at B Y U _now_ [, and] [so] [they have] [no] [one] at home , she's [back] teaching [school] full [time] _now_ , [again .] [So] [if , you know [,] it's] [not] [, [it's] just] [a] temporary [thing .] 
A|84| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|85| B: [Well ,] [we're] geared [to] [that .] We're [like ,] okay , [like [I] want] [a] living room set [. And] instead [of] sitting [back] _and [,_ and] [going] , okay [, well [,] it's] [going to] cost [maybe a] thousand dollars , [two] thousand dollars [and] I'll save [for two] years , 
A|86| A: That [would] _be_ , certainly _be_ [a] deterrent . 
B|87| B: [I know [,] [and] [I] [think] [,] I think] [that's] ridiculous . 
A|88| A: _Oh , really ?_ 
B|89| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] Health [food] [, uh ,] restaurants [that ,] 
B|91| B: [And] even [, um [,] uh ,] police corps which [started] [, you know ,] finding [other] breeds [to use] [because] [this thing] , [this] , [this thing] known _as_ [a] German shepherd [here] , its personality [and] its dependability [and] its reliability [was just] terrible . [So] [about] fifteen years ago [the] German Shepherd Club [of] America decided amongst themselves [that [they] were] [going to] [change] [this] . [So] [they] [went] [back to] Europe [and] [brought] [back] [some] [good] examples [of] each [of the] three breeds [and] bred [to a] standard [what] [they] wanted [an] American German shepherd [to] [be] . Which [is a] very heavily _now_ Skutzhund [and] Alsatian , 
A|92| A: [Oh] . 
B|93| B: [And] you're [more] receptive . 
A|94| A: [Uh _,] they_ classify [most of] [them] [as] professionals . 
B|95| B: [yeah ,] fluid resistance . 
A|96| A: Not [that I] [was] [looking] [for] sports cars [, [but] ,] [now the] people [I've] talked [to] don't seem [to] [have] stick shift . 
B|97| B: An Escort definitely [was] [not] among [them] . In fact [, there] wasn't [an] American car [in] [there] . 
A|98| A: You [know what] [I'm] saying ? Like , 
B|99| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: [Right .] That will , 
B|101| B: [So] [that is] _why_ [we] [you know] [play] over [there] cause [we] [have] [got] [our] card 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [Well [,] [in] Florida] [seems [like] [,] uh ,] [two] [or] three [times] [a] year . [It's] constantly [on] [the] , 
A|104| A: [and [,] uh _, uh ,] I_ can't understand [why] anyone [would] abandon [this] dog , though . 
B|105| B: Wow [, that's] great . 
A|106| A: [Yeah .] 
B|107| B: Fifty-five [is the] minimum [but] [they] [usually] run [about] sixty [to] sixty-five [. And] [the ones that are] shown [, they] [are] inside [that] weight allowance . 
A|108| A: What [do] [you] [use] [it] [for] ? 
B|109| B: [I know] [a] guy [that] upgrades [, uh [,] for] [a] reasonable cost . 
A|110| A: [Right .] 
B|111| B: [Oh , really ?] 
A|112| A: [He] never meows , [he] , [he] [doesn't] [have] any [front] claws [, I] [had] him declawed , 
B|113| B: [And [,] uh , I] [read] [it] [and] [really] liked [it] [and then] [about] [, that is] when [it] [really] [got] big [. [And] [,] uh [,] so] [I ,]
