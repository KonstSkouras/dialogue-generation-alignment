A|30| A: _Oh [,_ yeah , well] we're , [we] [are] [on] [the] dry side _of the_ mountains . Seattle [is] only _about_ two [and] [a] half hours , [so] [of] course [I'm a] real Seahawks fan 
B|31| B: [I] _think that_ [they] _should_ [be] [put] away . 
A|32| A: Uh [, well] [then] [you] must [know] [a] [lot] [more] _about this_ than [I] [do] 
B|33| B: [Oh ,] That didn't [, uh ,] 
A|34| A: [I] suppose [it] would [just] _about_ depend [on] who _was_ coming [, I] guess . 
B|35| B: [I mean] usually [, you know , you] [go to] work _before_ [they're] awake [or] [as] [they're] [getting] , [up] _for_ school [and [you] get] _home_ [and] [it's] already dark unless [it's] summer time [, you know] [.

A|40| A: [And] hopefully _he_ won't [have] [too many] surprises [when] _he_ gets [home] . 
B|41| B: Rome , New York [, it's] [up] state [it] [it's] [, uh ,] near Syracuse 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|44| A: [Oh ,] _neat ._ 
B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] What's [so] [sad] [about this] [is] both [of [the] , the] man [and the] woman _had_ [a] degree [having to do] [with] computers _but ,_ [their] training _isn't_ _what we_ need [in] [this country] . 
A|46| A: At _at_ , excuse me _, at_ [what] age _did you_ , _Oh , that's_ [too] bad [because] , 
B|47| B: Huh . 
A|48| A: Makes [a] [lot of] [difference] . 
B|49| B: _Right ,_ uh-huh . A [lot [of] the] older family lives [in] Vernon . 
A|50| A: [Yeah .] 
B|51| B: [that] [is] [just] [really] [neat .] Because [I] , 
A|52| A: Up until , [like] , eighty-five [or] something _was_ [the ,] 
B|53| B: [You] [were] ? 
A|54| A: [Yeah [,] uh [,] I] _was_ living [in] northern Jersey [when] [that] law came [through] , remember hearing _all_ [about] [it ,] 
B|55| B: [Well [,] it's] [kind [of] ,] hilly _, but [,_ it's] [, you know ,] low hills [, it's] [not] [, uh ,] 
A|56| A: My daughter _and [, and_ I] hate camping [so] [we] [go] shopping . So [that] [just] [kind of] works [out] real [well] . 
B|57| B: No . [Well] [it's] interesting [. I] bet [that] _was [a_ good] day [, at] [the] [yeah ,] conference [then] . 
A|58| A: Uh _, that makes_ [a] big [difference] . 
B|59| B: [and] [many] times I've seen [on] trials [they] [have] [on] T V [, the] jury [will] make [a] recommendation [as] [to] leniency [or] [as] [to] [the] death penalty [or] whatever [, but I] _think that it_ _should_ [be] [up] [to] [the] judge [and [the] [,] uh ,] lawyers [to] make [the] decision [as] [to] [what] [the] actual penalty [will] [be] . 
A|60| A: [Well] [that's] okay [. I] guess [it's] [an] easy _thing_ [to do] . So you're [you have a] big , [do] [you have a] rural house [or] [what] [do] [you have] ? 
B|61| B: [and] _but ,_ 
A|62| A: [Right] . Have [to] agree [with] [you] [, [and] I'm] [kind of] [in] favor [of] capital punishment also [. I] [just] [don't [think] that it] acts much [as] [a] deterrent [to] _these people_ [because] [, uh [,] you] still [see] [them] committing [the] same crimes [, but [,] I] tend [to] agree [with] [you] [that [,] uh ,] [we] [should] [have] [it] [I] [just] [, I don't] [know] [that] [it's] always effective [but I] guess [we [,] uh ,] we're [kind of] stuck [with] [it .] It's [, it's] [a] difficult [, uh ,] problem , [isn't] [it ,] [to] determine how you're going [to] punish somebody [for a] particular crime [, uh ,] 
B|63| B: [Yeah [,] that's] [right] [, you know] [he] [was] [one] [of] ours , [one] [of] [our] boys . 
A|64| A: [Right] . 
B|65| B: _That's_ true . 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [Well _,] what_ [did you] [do] [when] [you] helped [these people] ? 
A|68| A: So [we] took [those] [back] [, and] [that's] [about] [that] _all that_ [were] taken [back in] ages . 
B|69| B: _That's_ _great_ . 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: _Well , uh [,_ the] hobbies [that] [I] pursue [in] [my] spare time , [are] crafts [and , uh ,] I've _been_ involved [in] making [, uh ,] hat stands [and , uh ,] rag dolls [and , uh ,] different type hats [with] [, uh ,] [flowers and] roses [, you know [,] [and ,] uh [,] that] [kind of] _thing ,_ straw hats [and ,] [all that] [kind of] stuff . 
A|72| A: [Well , uh ,] [if] [a] [lot of] [people] [did] [that ,] [then] [we] wouldn't [have a] [lot of] [this] junk mail [. That's] [a] [great] idea [. I] hadn't thought [about] [that] [and] [we] might [be] able [to] incorporate [some] [of] [that] . One [thing ,] 
B|73| B: [Oh , that's wonderful .] Okay . 
A|74| A: [Right ,] exactly [. I] [was a] [, I] [was a] Boy Scout . As part [of] being [a] Boy Scout [, you] [had] [to [do] [,] you know ,] projects [all] throughout [and] [then] [to] become [an] Eagle Scout [you [have] to] spend [a] , [do] [a] yearlong project . 
B|75| B: [I'm] [not] sure . 
A|76| A: [And , uh [,] [what] we] [did] [was] [just] [, uh ,] decide how [we] [had] [been] spending [our] [money] [before] , 
B|77| B: No , [not] [really] [, and , and] towns keep creeping closer [and] closer [, you know] . 
A|78| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|79| B: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] [Well [,] that makes] [it] hard [though] [for] [in] terms [of [,] you know ,] family time [with] , [with] him . 
A|80| A: [I mean] [if you] murder [a] guy [because] [he] murdered your partner [or] something [like] [that [,] [I] mean] pretty soon [you] run [out] [of] [people] [to] murder . 
B|81| B: [Yeah [,] I] [, I] [, yeah [,] I] [, I] [, I] truly believe [that [,] that] [before] [that [,] that [we] [have] to] address [the] racial , racial issues [in] [the] United States , [before] [we] [can] [go] anywhere . 
A|82| A: [Well [,] I] [just] watch [them .]
