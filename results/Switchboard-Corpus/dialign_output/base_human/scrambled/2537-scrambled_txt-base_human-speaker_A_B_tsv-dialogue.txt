B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: _Uh ,_ _I've_ , _I've_ said [for] [years] [that] [there's] [full] employment [for] [the] politically active [and] [in] our society [, uh ,] [there's] _very_ little [full] employment . Most people [in] _this_ _country_ _are_ getting worse _off [,_ not] better _off_ .

A|48| A: [You _know ,] [I_ don't know] your feelings toward [that] _. _I_ guess_ _we_ shouldn't [get] into [that] [but] , um [, _and] what_ [else] , um _, I think_ [in] [some] ways [that they] need [to] _be_ more careful _of the_ teachers [that they] hire . 
B|49| B: [I don't know .] 
A|50| A: The cat [was] [here] first [so] _I know ,_ _it's_ hard .

A|52| A: [I] wonder how [long] _it's_ _going to_ _be_ [on] [for] . 
B|53| B: [and] [I] _like_ [it .] [And] [what] [I've been] thinking [about] doing [is] volunteering [for] [this] [, uh ,] Asian center [that _,] a_ Doctor Falk has started [, that] works [with] [the] school district . 
A|54| A: [so] . 
B|55| B: [Yeah _,] [if_ [you] can] afford [that] [kind of] [a] toy , [then] _, I guess [,_ uh] 
A|56| A: [I] [was] _a ,_ student [there and] spent , um [, a] semester studying abroad [in] London . 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|58| A: It sure does _. I_ made mistake _one_ [year] [and] planted [some] cantaloupe , [my] goodness [, what] [a] mistake [that was] . 
B|59| B: [Yeah [,] and] [I] _like_ [it .] 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh] [, uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: Gorgeous . [That's] [, you know [, I] think] [you] could drive along _in Maryland_ [and] look _at the_ sweet gum trees [on] each side _and [the_ [,] _and] the_ pines [and what] _not [,_ and] [you] could [, you know [,] you] could [be] driving along [in] East Texas [and] looks [just] [the] same [. It's] almost [, you know ,] identical [kind of] [country] . 
A|62| A: [Yeah [,] well] _being_ [in] , [in] Baltimore see , [Maryland] [is ,] um , [is] sort [of] , um , [is] _as _,_ as a_ hub [of] liberalism [you know ,] compared [to the] [country] [, uh [,] you know ,] _very_ [, uh ,] [in] , [in] [many] ways [, uh ,] _very_ liberal _very_ somewhat [to] [New] England [though] Pennsylvania [and] [New York] _, uh , I_ , aren't [actually] [as] liberal , [Maryland] [is] _a very_ liberal [, uh ,] state [so ,] [so ,] where [here] _we_ [have] , um _, we_ [have] gun control laws _we_ probably [have] [some _of] the_ strictest gun control laws [in] [the] nation [and] most people [in Maryland] vote [for] [that [,] you know .] 
B|63| B: that's MAJOR DAD _at_ [eight] [I think] [it] [is] . 
A|64| A: [And] [that was] even harder [for] [, I] [was] [on] [a] business trip [at [the] time] [and the] dog [was] _being_ house sit , _or_ dog sit , whatever , [by] [some] friends [of] mine _down the_ street , 
B|65| B: [Uh [,] we [had] [a] ,] [at] [a] fairly young age [we] started teaching [them] [to] play games [and] [card] games [and] [so] forth . [And] [, _and] , uh [,_ uh [,] but] [we] didn't [, uh [,] do] [it] [as] [much] [or] [as] often [as [,] uh , I] [would have] liked [to] [. I] [would] _like_ [to] [do that] [as [a] [,] as a] [family] [and [,] and] [some] T V watching . 
A|66| A: [and , uh ,] whether [or] [not ,] um , they'll _ever_ [get] into [like] huge transit systems into big cities where people [would] [all] travel [on] [a] high speed [, uh ,] train [or] , [or] something [like] [that] [or] , 
B|67| B: _Oh_ . 
A|68| A: Okay . 
B|69| B: [Uh [,] [and] it's] [, uh _, I] guess_ [what] [they] call [a] story [and a half] . [Because] [it's] [not] [a] [full] two story . Where [, you know ,] [everything] [on] top [is] [on] bottom . 
A|70| A: [Because] [I don't] [like] credit cards [for] _one thing_ [, you know , I] mean , [they're] okay [, I guess [,] if] you're [on] [a] trip [or] something [, you] [don't] [have] [to] take [a] whole bunch [of] [, you know ,] cash [with] [you ,] 
B|71| B: [I guess] [one thing] [they're] working [on] [now] [is] recycling plastics _too_ . Like [, uh] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh] [, I] [do] , [too] , yep . 
B|73| B: Yes [, we] [do] practice capital punishment [, but] [the] nature [of _the] , uh ,_ courts [and the] appeals [and the] stays [and] [all] [that] means [that] [it's [a] very] [long] haul before anybody's [ever] executed . 
A|74| A: [Oh ,] [I'm] sure [it] [would] . 
B|75| B: Those petroleum products [are] [going to] kill [us .] 
A|76| A: [But] [we] [have] [, uh ,] [one] , [one thing] [that] effects [us] [is] [we] [have] apartments [that] [are] probably [about] [a half] mile away [and] [now] [the] economy [is] [bad] _, they_ [have] trouble keeping those [full] [so] [they've] dropped [the , uh ,] [they're] [not] nearly [as] selective [as] [they] used [to] [be] . 
B|77| B: [Yeah [,] [I] know [,] and] that's , that's [what] happened [to] [my] brother . He came [to] school [up] [here] [, and] [then] when [he] went [down] [there] , [he [was] just] [so] [bad] [off [,] you know] [from] [not] [being] able [to] stay [up] [here] [that] his life [just] went [down the] drain . 
A|78| A: [I know] [they] say [that [,] that] [is ,] 
B|79| B: [Yeah] . One [year] [they] were [, they] were [just] everywhere .
