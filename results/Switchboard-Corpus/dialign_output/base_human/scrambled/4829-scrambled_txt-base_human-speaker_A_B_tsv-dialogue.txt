B|9| B: _Yeah _,_ the_ first , first couple [of] times [it's] pretty scary _but , uh ,_ after [that] [you] [realize] [they] are _just_ as afraid [of] [you] , too . 
A|10| A: [Yeah _,] yeah ._ 
B|11| B: That's great . 
A|12| A: _And_ families took care [of] themselves _and ,_ um [, but] now _, you know ,_ people _don't_ , [they] _don't_ support each other [that] way . 
B|13| B: [Oh _,] well ,_ still _that's_ [a] [, you know _,] that's_ _a good_ chunk [of] kids . 
A|14| A: [I mean] like going , um , forward [and] backward [a] word _or_ up [and] down [a] line [that] _sort of_ _thing_ _just [,_ you know ,] didn't match _with_ [the] kinds [of] keys [, you] _were_ using . 
B|15| B: _Yes ._ We've , _my_ [, uh _,] well ,_ when we first got married , _my_ wife worked _for a_ _year_ . Then we decided [to] _have_ kids . 
A|16| A: [Yeah] . Probably our _family_ room _is_ [the] [, the] biggest . Uh , 
B|17| B: [And] [they] _can_ tell me , basically _some_ things [that] _I don't_ [know] 
A|18| A: Sure . Let somebody _get_ something _out_ [of] _it ._ 
B|19| B: [and [,] uh ,] [that] seems _to be_ [sort of] [a] middle ground _for_ all _of the_ Texas [family] . 
A|20| A: [Yeah] . 
B|21| B: The [, the] penalty phase [, yeah] , they've , decide [the] penalty separately from [the] verdict .

B|23| B: She made these onion rings [that] [were] _so_ _good_ , 
A|24| A: [Yeah] . 
B|25| B: _and then_ , [of] course , _one_ [thing] _I _think_ ,_ too [, is] [with] 
A|26| A: [but , uh ,] this [year] [my] husband recharged our freon [because] _it_ _was_ , needed [to be] done [, and] [one] [of the] cans released entire amount [of] freon into [the] [, uh ,] into [the] air [because] he opened _it_ , 
B|27| B: [Okay .] 
A|28| A: [Oh] . 
B|29| B: _so_ , 
A|30| A: [Yes .] _Uh-huh ._ 
B|31| B: _But_ [not] worth [it .] 
A|32| A: _Right [,_ you know ,] [they] , they'd figure [a] way around [that] [one] in [a] heartbeat . [But] , I'm wondering if there's another issue here [, and] maybe this [is] why this has died _out_ . Can [you] [go] into [, and] this wasn't [the] question [but] [it's] _, it_ may [be] [the] more [of the] issue versus should young adults , [can] [they] [go] in _there_ [and] [can] anyone [go] into [, well ,] _out_ [of the] Kurdish community [is] [a] [little bit] extreme [at] this [time , but] say [, [I] think] Bangladesh would [have] been [a good] example _or_ [some] , [some] [really] desperate situation [and] teach them [to] farm [and] teach them [and] [it] doesn't do any [good] . 
B|33| B: [And] [, uh [,] well ,] give [you] an idea [, it's] three [and] [a] half miles [of] dirt road [to] [the] concrete _, I mean_ , [to] [the] asphalt , we're [out] [there] . 
A|34| A: _Uh-huh ._ Exactly . [And] [I don't] [think [,] uh [,] it's] ended up being [, I mean] [it] gave people jobs 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [But] [it's] [just [,] it] [just] [was] [not] [and] [you] [get] stung [a] [time] [or] two , 
A|38| A: [and then] [it] doesn't sell [and then] [the] bank's holding [the] bag . 
B|39| B: [Right [,] yeah .] 
A|40| A: [But] [, I] used [to] work [for a] power company , [so] [it] [was] _very_ important [that] [they] make sure their employees , especially linemen [uh ,] [were] clean . 
B|41| B: [I] guess [I] relate [it] [to] , [to] Japan [where] things are [very] expensive , aren't [they] ? 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|44| A: [Yeah] .
