B|45| B: [Now] _, I think_ your insurance covers her [on] [that ,] 
A|46| A: [Oh ,] [of] course [. It's] [, it's] political maneuvering .

A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [Yeah [,] [I] would] [guess] [so] . 
A|68| A: They're [just] [getting] [, uh ,] put [on] probation _or_ [something] [, because] [the] prisons [don't] [have] enough room [so] [they] [get] , [they] [get] lighter sentences , 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| B: [Yeah [,] it's] [a] [, it's] [a] [little] [, it's] [a] [little] hard [you] [have to] plod through [it] [and , you know [,] it does] [not] [have] [a] real story , [or] any plot , 
A|72| A: My [, my] [little] boy [has] gotten [so] into [it] [that] he's identified [the , the] people [that] [have] written certain songs , [then] [he] buys [the] pieces [that] [have] [that] [person .] [You know ,] [on] [it .]
