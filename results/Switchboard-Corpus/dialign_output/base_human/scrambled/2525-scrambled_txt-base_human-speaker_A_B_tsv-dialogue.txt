A|20| A: _Oh ._ 
B|21| B: [Yeah , _we] _don't_ [,_ _we] _don't_ _,_ um ,_ use aluminum cans , 
A|22| A: _Well ,_ _not_ [the] rain _so much_ [as] [the] cool _, _the_ other_ mornings [when _it] was_ [like] sixty-five [when] [we] woke _up_ [and] sixty-six [, and] today _I know_ [when] [I] [got] _up_ [that] [the] temperature said _more_ [like] , _close ,_ seventy-nine _or_ _eighty_ 
B|23| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|24| A: _Okay ,_ wow 
B|25| B: [I] live _out_ [in the] country [, yeah] . 
A|26| A: [Yeah . _I] guess_ [you know] enough [to] look _where_ you're walking _or_ sitting _or_ whatever you're doing . 
B|27| B: If [we] can cut back [the] usage , then _uh ,_ _maybe_ [it] _will_ _have _to_ go_ someplace _else_ . 
A|28| A: Sure . 
B|29| B: _So ,_ 
A|30| A: [it is] hard _. It's_ [, uh _,] like_ anything [else] whether _or_ _not_ [you] _want to_ _sacrifice_ _another_ half hour . 
B|31| B: [I _don't] [,_ I don't] [know] _that they_ always [have] [because] [I] [never] sat _all _the_ way_ through [a] jury trial _. They_ _get_ too boring . 
A|32| A: _Really ._ 
B|33| B: [Oh .] Huh . 
A|34| A: _You_ [do] [these] fun [things] [, you know ,] [in] _other_ kinds _of_ ways [and] _I know_ Manhattan's real expensive _but_ [, um _,] it's_ _kind of_ [a] different situation [because] you're _probably_ living [in] an apartment , [right] ? 
B|35| B: [I] thought [that] [was] _on_ [the] upswing again _now ._ 
A|36| A: _But_ [these] [people] _obviously_ weren't . 
B|37| B: _I think_ [two] . 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [I [know] [,] and] [that] makes [me] [so] mad [You] [know _,] [it_ is] [like] [it is] [not] going _to do that_ [much] damage _to the_ course _, but_ apparently [they] _think_ differently 
A|40| A: [Because] everyone gains _from_ _it ._ 
B|41| B: [but] [because] _of _that_ we_ _didn't_ [have] _very_ _many_ pets afterwards [and] then _he_ had _fish_ . 
A|42| A: Do _you have a_ lawn ? 
B|43| B: [I don't] [know] [Yeah] _I think_ [it was] . 
A|44| A: _And , uh [,_ it] helps _for a while_ 
B|45| B: [It's] [more] rural , 
A|46| A: [but] I'm [, but] _they've got_ [all] [these] caution signs [now] [on] [fish] 
B|47| B: [and] [that's] [where] [, uh ,] leaders can use [, uh ,] use [that] whenever [the] opportune moment arises . 
A|48| A: _But_ _I mean_ _there's_ , _there's_ , _there's a_ lot _of other_ crimes [out] _there_ [, _I] mean_ besides murder _, I think [,_ uh ,] [now] [if] you're dealing _drugs_ [now] , caught [more] _than_ twice _or something_ [, uh _,] it ,_ _there's_ _, uh , a_ death penalty associated _with_ _it ._ 
B|49| B: [Okay] _. Uh_ what type _of , uh ,_ utilizations _do you_ [make] [of] [it] ? Word processing [obviously] . 
A|50| A: Up until _, it's_ coach pitch , until [you] [get] nine which _my_ _little_ boy _will be_ nine [in] May . 
B|51| B: _Right ._ Besides [the] fact [that] _how_ [much] interest [you] _pay_ [and] then _this_ ... 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh [.] Yeah .] That _, that_ seems _to make_ sense [but] leave [it] _up_ [to the] [more] experienced person who knows [how] [it] fits into _the , uh ,_ _kind _of_ the_ rate [for] different . 
B|53| B: For instance [, uh [,] I] saw [a] _thing_ [on] [, uh ,] NOVA [, I think] [it was] [the other] day . 
A|54| A: [but] [, uh ,] no [I] [didn't] [get] [to the] Great Barrier Reef [. I] drove _from_ Sidney [down to] Melbourne [and] over [to] Adelaide . 
B|55| B: [Right ,] exactly . 
A|56| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|57| B: Sevren [is] east , near [the] eastern shore , 
A|58| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|59| B: _Right _._ So_ [it's] _pretty_ fair [they've got] [you] slaving _away_ , _at_ , _at this_ point 
A|60| A: _And_ _that is_ true [in] [many] , [many] _areas_ [of [,] you know [,] uh ,] job titles [and] professions . 
B|61| B: [You] [just] [get] used [to] [it .] 
A|62| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|63| B: Um _, uh-huh_ [, um] [. [Yeah] [,] yeah [,] that's] _nice_ . [You] say [have] your _four_ _year_ _old_ taking lessons already ? 
A|64| A: [Yeah [,] but] [we don't] [do] [much] [in [the] way] [of , uh ,] flowers _. We_ [have] _one_ _little_ flower garden [that we] _, [that_ we] work _with_ . 
B|65| B: [Okay] . Yes [, I] [do] 
A|66| A: _Well , I_ found [, uh _,] that ,_ [in the] place [that [it] was] harder [for] [me] [to] stick [to] [a] budget [was] [not] [where] _we were_ concerned [, but] [where] [maybe] _our_ friends _were_ concerned [and] _our_ relatives [and] parents . 
B|67| B: [Yeah .] 
A|68| A: [Yeah _,] the_ press _has_ [a] lot [of] _power_ . 
B|69| B: Say [out] , instead [of] [out] [you] say [out] . Did [you know] [that] ? 
A|70| A: _Well , _I_ , _I_ ,_ 
B|71| B: someone [in the] What's [the] name _of that_ restaurant ? [in the] background Where _at_ ? . someone [in the] background The Hari Krishna . [in the] background relies [Oh .] Kalachandji's . Kalachandji's [. It's] [all] vegetarian [, and] [it [,] [it] was] [just] fabulous [. [I] mean] , [my] husband [was] aghast [because] [I] ate turnip greens [and] liked [it .] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [Well] [I think] [it] _should_ [be] permitted under certain 
A|74| A: [Uh ,] [when] _we were_ [in] Australia [, uh ,] sad _little_ [things] [. [Uh ,] I] felt sorry [for them .] [Because] [their] society isn't _there_ anymore [, _and] their_ belief system [and] [all] [their] structured [of] theirs , [all the] structures [of] [their] society [are] gone , essentially . 
B|75| B: [And] _some_ [we] [do] green [and] then [my wife] puts [them] [on] pizzas . [And [,] and] chops [them] [up] [in] recipes [and] [things] [like] [that] . 
A|76| A: _do you ?_ 
B|77| B: [Really .] 
A|78| A: Ready [to] talk ? 
B|79| B: More [money] )) , 
A|80| A: Over _a very_ long period [of] _time_ . 
B|81| B: [I [know] [,] it's] [, it's] [, it's] getting [, it's] [been] [out] [of] hand [, I think ,] [for a while] [, and] _it just_ continues [to] [get] worse . 
A|82| A: [Right .] 
B|83| B: [and their] economy [is] , [of] several [of the] countries , especially Columbia , [is] [so] _built_ [on] [the ,] [on] [on] [the] [drugs] [, that [,] uh ,] [our] , [our] [little] war [on] [drugs] [has] _really_ [been] laughable [. It's] [just] [a] [, you know ,] such _a small_ _amount_ [, and] [it] _it just_ [, it [,] uh ,] cuts off [just] [a] trickle [, [and] [,] uh ,] [if] , [if] [we] can't [get] [a] handle [on] [that] through _some_ , through _some_ [, uh ,] method [, I don't] [know] [where] [, that] [will be] [another] [big] problem . 
A|84| A: [Oh .] 
B|85| B: [Well [, I] think] [that] [would] [be] [kind of] drastic punishment . 
A|86| A: [You] _want [to_ go] first 
B|87| B: [and] [if] [there's a] _game_ [on] _, he's_ watching [it [.] [I] mean] [, that's] [all] [there] [is] [to] [it ,] 
A|88| A: [Yeah [.] They] [don't] [do that] here . _Course_ [they] [pay] _them [,_ but] [they [don't] [,] you] [don't [,] you] _or_ [the] insurance companies [never] _see_ _any_ [of that] [money] . 
B|89| B: [Okay ,] what [do you] feel [are] _some_ _of the main_ problems ? 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh] , section , yes [, uh-huh] . 
B|91| B: _So [,_ uh ,] 
A|92| A: _Isn't that_ [a] shame . 
B|93| B: [Uh-huh .] [Okay [,] so] [they] [know] [that] . [And] [that's] ... 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [I] couldn't either . 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: _So ,_ 
A|98| A: [So] _most_ _of the [,_ it's] almost _twenty_ years [old] [, and] _most_ [of the] houses around here _were_ [built] [pretty] [much] _the same_ style [Uh [,] we] _have a_ friend [that] lives [two] blocks over [, and] his house [is] almost identical [to] us , except his [is] three bedrooms [and] ours [is] [four] 
B|99| B: _Oh ,_ [do you ?] [So] [you] live [in] Garland then . 
A|100| A: [Well ,] 
B|101| B: [Well [,] we] live [, uh ,] [pretty] [close ,] [to the] Mesquite Golf [Course] . 
A|102| A: _But_ _it's nice_ having [a] dog here [, uh _,] [the_ ,] 
B|103| B: [We] had [to] _put_ [so much] poison [out] [on] everything [that we] thought , Who'd [want to] eat [that] [stuff] . 
A|104| A: [And] [I] [would] hate [to] [have to] hear _any_ [kind of] case , involving [a] violent crime _or_ anything . 
B|105| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|106| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|107| B: [Isn't that] [nice] [. [I] mean] [it's nice] [when] [you have a] piece [that [,] [that] is] [so [,] so] peaceful [, that] everybody likes [, you know ,] 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: [and [,] uh] [and] [that] [would] [make any] parent feel good [and] bad _at_ [the same] [time] [, you know ,] 
A|110| A: No , no . [Well] life [just] took different _turns_ here [so [,] uh [,] [it] just] [didn't] work [out] [to do that] [now _.] So [,_ he's] [, he's] _about_ ready [to] retire , [another] [year] [and] [he] , 
B|111| B: [Uh ,] both 
A|112| A: You've hit [pretty] , you've [put] [a] lot [of the main] points [in .] 
B|113| B: [and [,] uh [,] I] read sporadically [of] commentary [and a] couple [of other] [, you know ,] trade magazines [, [and] [,] uh [,] uh ,] such [as] [that [,] uh ,] [where] [I] might read [the [,] the] occasional social [and] even current event commentaries [, [and] [,] and] everything [as] diverse [as] A C M [to] [, uh [,] uh ,] _some_ [of [the ,] uh ,] _some_ [of [the] other] tabloids [I] [get] [. So [,] uh [,] [I] guess] [I] use [about] [eighty] percent written , [is] [probably] [my] input [and] [twenty] percent [, uh ,] television [. [I] [, I] think] [I] respect [the ,] [from] [a] journalistic perspective current events . 
A|114| A: [Yeah ,] seems [that they] [should] regulate themselves [a] [little] bit [, and] [I don't] [think they] ever care [to] . 
B|115| B: "To operate [, yeah] [. But] [, you know ,] [people] [are] buying [them .] [You] [know] whose buying [them] ? *""whose"" = who's"" The [power] company . Free [, you know ,] free [for them .] " 
A|116| A: [Oh [,] _I] see_ . 
B|117| B: [And , uh [,] [we] were] [never] [much] [of [, uh ,] [a] very] [, uh ,] family _thing_ [, you know ,] made [, like] [go] skiing [in] Vermont [or something] . 
A|118| A: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
B|119| B: Himself [and] her ? 
A|120| A: [and] [they] could sell [it] [for a while] [. They] [were] able [to] sell [it] [for] [some] [amount] per ton [and] [now] [at this] stage [of the] [game] [where] [they] [have] gotten into recycling , [they've] collected [so much] news print [that they] [have [to] pay] [to] [have] [it] hauled [away] . 
B|121| B: [But] [it [,] it's] interesting , listening [to] [them [.] [I] think [,] I think] [the] social changes [in] [them [,] I think] [I see] [it] [more] [with] [that] generation [than] [I] [do] [with] [like] [our] generation . 
A|122| A: Andrews ? 
B|123| B: [And , uh ,] she , she [got] pregnant [and] then [we] decided she [would] stay home [with] [the] kids [. We] [would] [make] [that] [sacrifice] . It [is] [a] financial [sacrifice] [to make] [because] [we] [go] [from] [two] incomes [down to] [one] . 
A|124| A: [We] [do] [the same] [thing] [. It's] [, I] [just] [have [a] small] plot [it's] [like] ten feet by five feet . 
B|125| B: [So] [the] engine kicks [on] [when] [the] batteries need [power] [and] [it] [turns] off . 
A|126| A: [Yeah .] 
B|127| B: This [is] [one] , [this] [is] [one] [of the] [most] highly taxed [areas] [in the] country .
