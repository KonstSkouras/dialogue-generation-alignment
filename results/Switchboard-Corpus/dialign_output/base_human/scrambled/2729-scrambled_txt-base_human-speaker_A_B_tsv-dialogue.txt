A|0| A: _That's_ _how_ bad _it was_ . Everything _is_ _just_ _down_ everywhere . 
B|1| B: _Well _,_ _I_ _I_ haven't_ reached _that_ _point_ _yet ._ _I've_ heard _people_ say _that ._ _But_ _, uh ,_ _my_ middle son [is] engaged , _my_ oldest son _has_ _been_ _going_ with _the same_ girl _for_ _a while ._ 
A|2| A: _Uh _,_ well _,_ no [,_ I] _can't_ _really_ complain . _I'm_ [a] _student_ _, um _,_ and_ [I _I] work_ _as_ [a] co-op _at_ [, uh ,] Georgia Tech Research Institute _. And , uh _,_ I'm_ [going] _to get_ _back_ _most_ _of_ _what_ [I] earned [, _I] mean_ _most_ _of_ _what_ [I] pay _in_ taxes _and , uh _,_ and , uh _,_ _one_ of_ [my] parents [is] still claiming _me ._ 
B|3| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|4| A: No _actually_ [I haven't] [been] _all_ through Europe _, _like_ [I_ haven't] [been] _to_ Italy [yet .] 
B|5| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|6| A: you're _just_ _as_ blessed , _probably_ _more _,_ because_ _if you_ follow _this_ _, there's _a_ good_ book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING , by Richard Fugate 
B|7| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|8| A: _That's_ _, that's_ [been] [my] impression . 
B|9| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: [Yeah _.] Uh ,_ _very_ 
B|11| B: _Well_ _at least_ _that_ _would_ _give_ [a] person [a] chance [to] _look_ _you know ._ Because _the_ way [it] [is] _, a_ person [really] _don't_ _have a_ chance 
A|12| A: _Are you_ ? 
B|13| B: _I don't_ [, _I] don't _know_ that_ [you] _could_ require everyone [to] _, _do_ that_ _for_ , yeah , _to do it_ _for_ [a] whole _year_ _, or_ two _years_ _or _something_ _like_ _that_ ,_ 
A|14| A: _So ,_ 
B|15| B: [Uh [,] I'm] _doing_ _basically_ system , system design _work [and_ , uh ,] implementation [work] _for_ _the_ speech _, for_ _the_ speech group [uh ,] _here ._ 
A|16| A: _And_ _I , um , _I_ just_ refuse [to] buy _it _,_ um _,_ if_ _I know_ _I'm not_ [going] _to be_ _there_ [for] [at least] five [years] _, uh , you_ _, you know ._ 
B|17| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|18| A: _So_ [you] _do that [and_ ,] _right _,_ _and_ then_ _we_ try [to do] [a] family activity _on_ Saturday , _usually_ _in the_ morning . 
B|19| B: [I] feel sorry [for] _her_ . 
A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [And] _they_ _don't_ _have a_ goal _, they_ _don't_ _have a_ goal _, they_ _don't_ _have_ an interest [in] _their_ own field [of] study . 
A|22| A: It _, it's_ [really] nice _. _I_ would_ _, I would_ spend _all_ [my] _time_ [in] London [, or] _most_ [of] [my] _time_ , 
B|23| B: [Uh ,] [my] _home_ [is] [, well _,] is_ typical [for] [the] _area_ [. I] live _in a_ development [, uh [,] it's] [a] relatively [, I would] say [, well ,] God _, it_ sounds _like ,_ sounds [like] [I'm] bragging 
A|24| A: _and they_ came _from [the_ same] litter [and] _everything_ . 
B|25| B: [and] why ? 
A|26| A: [But] [I] _did_ [a] walk last night _, _and_ it_ seemed _like _it_ was_ _a little_ bit hot still . Sometimes _when you_ [work] _up_ [a] sweat [you] need [it] _to be_ _a little_ bit cooler . 
B|27| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh [.] _I] think_ _that's_ _right ,_ 
B|29| B: _Right_ [, uh _,] but_ yes _, we_ _just ,_ [just] love _them_ [to] death . 
A|30| A: _And so [,_ but] [that] somehow takes , organization . For _me_ [, it's] _much_ easier [just] [the] stationary bike _, you know [,_ it's] [at] [home] [, I] _can_ [, I] _can_ [do] some [of] [my] reading , 
B|31| B: We _always_ _had_ gardens [when] [I] [was] [, uh ,] living _in Chicago_ . In _fact ,_ [my] mother once tore [up] _our_ entire [back] yard [and] redid _it ._ I'll _never_ forget . Got [my] stepfather [to] put [in] [, uh _,] a_ waterfall [and] [a little] pond _in one_ corner [. _I] mean _,_ that_ [was] [like] [the] [most] energy invested [in] anything [in the] whole [time] [I] _ever_ knew him _They_ remodeled [the] entire [back] yard . Then [they] sold [the] house [and] _got_ divorced _, _so_ _I don't_ know what_ [that] _says_ _about_ _it all_ 
A|32| A: [Yeah .] 
B|33| B: [But] [it] _definitely_ [would] _give_ _a lot _of_ the_ kids now [that] _have_ [everything] given [to] _them_ [that] [they] _want to_ _see_ [what] [it's] [like] [if you] _don't_ _have_ _all the_ money [and] [can't] _have_ [what] [you] _want_ [when you] _want_ _it ._ 
A|34| A: _Yeah _, I_ am_ [I] need _it _,_ too ,_ otherwise , 
B|35| B: Hello . 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] Sure . Makes [, uh ,] _makes_ [a] colorful salad _too_ . 
B|37| B: _Right_ _and the_ weed come [up] , 
A|38| A: _So_ [that] gives us special [time] together _too_ . 
B|39| B: _Oh ,_ [really] ? [I] _didn't_ _know _that_ ._ 
A|40| A: _And , uh [,_ so] [they] cancelled [that] [one] [and , uh ,] _are_ looking next [year] bringing _it back_ closer [, but] [we] [have a] letter [, a] family letter [, that] circulates , 
B|41| B: [and] _one of the_ fish [was] missing [and they] couldn't find [it] anyplace _, they_ couldn't figure _out_ [what] _had_ happened [and then] [they] found [it] fried [on] _, the_ radiator behind . 
A|42| A: _What_ _do you_ [do] ? 
B|43| B: _Right_ , now [like] [my] ... _Right _._ Well [,_ like] [my] mother , _she_ _has_ [to] _go_ [for] testing _cause_ _she_ _has_ _got_ , 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|45| B: [Uh [,] no [,] no] [not] [, no ,] [this] [was] [, well [,] I am] [actually] [from] Mississippi [, and [,] so] [that's] , 
A|46| A: How [you] dress [for] [work and] season [to] season [and] [everything] . 
B|47| B: [and] [um [,] that's] [really] [what] [makes] [the] [most] sense [, because] [you] _don't_ [have] [to] use _so much_ water [, and] 
A|48| A: [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: Yes . 
A|50| A: [they] [really] [do] _. Yeah ._ 
B|51| B: Your [right [,] I] _do [,_ too [,] _I] think they_ start _out_ young [, _like] in_ [, uh ,] Girl Scouts [and] Boy Scouts [a] video _doing_ 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: _Oh_ [no] . 
A|54| A: [and , uh ,] also [, uh _,] [in_ [one] of] [my] wife's [, uh ,] companies _where_ [she] worked , they'd _had a_ real nice profit sharing _plan_ [that [,] [that] ,] 
B|55| B: You [know .] [That's] _just [,_ that's] [my] views [, you know .] 
A|56| A: [I] _kind _of_ , uh ,_ stopped listening after [a while .] 
B|57| B: put [in] garlic [and] onion powder [or] chopped onions [if you] _want [to_ [do] _that] [, you know_ .] [What] _ever_ , however [much] effort [you] feel [like] putting into _it ._ 
A|58| A: _Wow_ 
B|59| B: _I mean [,_ it's] _like , [if_ you] [plan] [a] [year] ahead [, you] [can] [probably] save [up] _seven_ hundred dollars [you know [,] one] thousand _four_ hundred dollars [to] send _your_ child [to] _college_ [, you know .] 
A|60| A: [Yeah _.] And [so_ I don't] [like] [to] arrive [, or] [, or] [when] [they] arrive [, _for] me _to_ be_ completely worn _out ._ 
B|61| B: _Right ._ My Dad _is actually_ [, uh ,] 
A|62| A: they're [always] , [always] happy _. I don't_ [think] [I've] [ever] seen [them] [not] [look] happy . 
B|63| B: [Yeah .] 
A|64| A: _Um_ . 
B|65| B: _Right ._ 
A|66| A: Minneapolis [area] , 
B|67| B: [so] [it's] [a good] experience . 
A|68| A: Same _idea_ 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|71| B: [But] [how] [do] [they] _afford_ [to] even [have] [the] kids [, uh ,] we're expecting _our_ _first_ baby , almost any _day_ [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah , I] found [it [,] you know [,] [in] the] _street_ . 
A|74| A: It's [that's] [no] _problem_ [here _.] [Yeah_ [,] we] [really] liked [it] [up] _there_ [but] [then] 
B|75| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|76| A: _Wow ._ 
B|77| B: _Well ,_ [my] dad wants [me to] _go_ _back _._ So_ . 
A|78| A: _Wow ._ You're [just [,] uh ,] [Oh [,] that's] incredible . 
B|79| B: [so] he _could_ _afford_ [to get] married [but] _, _is_ not_ engaged [yet] , 
A|80| A: That [would] _be_ nice [. [I] think] [I] saw [that] [on] T V [one] _time _._ They_ , maybe _it was_ C N N _where_ _they were_ demonstrating [that .] Or [something] similar [to] [that .] 
B|81| B: Heavy science . [Are you] _like in the_ particle , particle research [or] anything _like that_ [or] _is it_ [more [,] um ,] applied physics ? 
A|82| A: [and] [I think] [, um [,] in] [fact [,] if] _I _had_ [to_ do [it] all] again _I [,_ you know ,] after [that [, you know] [,] you] [never] [think] [of] [it] _because _,_ I guess_ [because] [I] paid [for] [all] [of] [my] [college] education myself [, I] [never] _thought_ [about] [doing] [that] [because] _I had_ [all] these [college] loans _I'd_ _started_ paying [back .] 
B|83| B: [to] _her_ Go talk [to] Daddy [about] _it ._ Excuse [me .] 
A|84| A: Cocoa [didn't] [think] [too] [much] [of] [it ,] though . She jumped [in] [and then] _started_ screaming [and] _made_ [me] pull [her] [back] _out . I_ pulled [her] [out] [and , uh ,] [then] _had to_ wrap [her] [up] [in a] sweatshirt [because] [she] [was] shivering [so] bad , 
B|85| B: Huh . 
A|86| A: Where [, [is] it] [in] Dallas ? 
B|87| B: Yes . 
A|88| A: _Uh-huh ,_ [Uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: We _could_ _go_ _around_ [, and ,] boy [and ,] 
A|90| A: _I know_ [it [,] _I] know_ [it .] 
B|91| B: _Right ._ Could [you] change [that] [as] [you] felt [like it] [or] [did] _you have_ [to do it] [the same] _every_ _week_ ? 
A|92| A: [Right .] 
B|93| B: _There's_ nothing [like] [them] [. They] [just] [don't] [have] [the same] ones [in the] supermarket 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: Some _of the_ crimes [are] [just] [so] brutal [and] [so [,] you know ,] useless . This may seem [to be] [the] best way [out _. I] don't [know_ .] 
A|96| A: [Yeah .] 
B|97| B: [Yeah .] Definitely [I think] [that] [there's] [probably] _a lot of_ waste [in] defense [and] [in] _government_ funded research [in the] _first_ _place ._ 
A|98| A: That _will_ [be] interesting . 
B|99| B: [Right .] 
A|100| A: [Well [,] that's] _good [._ Well [,] we] [, um ,] let's [see] [, the] _only_ other [place] [I've] [ever] vacationed , we'd [, you know ,] [go] [on] camping trips [up] [to] Texoma [and] _things [like_ [that] .] 
B|101| B: [Right .] 
A|102| A: [Well [,] we] [have a] funny commercial [around] [here .] It [says] [something [like] , if] [people] _were_ [to] [give] five , hours [a] [week] [or] five percent [of] [their] salary [, we] [could] [, they] [could] solve [all the] world's problems [or something] [. _So] _,_ I guess_ [if] [we] [all] [give] five hours [a] [week] [or] five percent [of] [our] salary [we] [could] [, uh ,] 
B|103| B: We rent [a] pavilion [and [,] and] [do that _and] that's_ [usually] works [out] [to be] pretty [good [.] And , uh [,] they] [will] rent [a] pavilion [on] [a] weekend [, and] [uh] 
A|104| A: Good [point] . We've [got] enough without without [a] passport [there's] plenty . 
B|105| B: What's [the] topic ? 
A|106| A: [Oh [,] so] [do] [I] . 
B|107| B: [So] [I've] [always] [had] [this] [problem] with CONSUMER REPORTS [that] [in the] _areas_ [that] [I know] _a lot_ [about] [, I] disagree with [them] . 
A|108| A: Anyway [, well [,] [you] [have] [a] good] [day] . 
B|109| B: [Yeah .] 
A|110| A: [Well [,] it] [just] seems [like in the] past _three_ [or] [four] [years] [it] [has] [just] gotten [so much] worse than _it was_ . [There's] [always] [been] [a] certain amount [of] crime [in] [your] [, you know ,] [your] urban [areas] [, and] [I know] [we] lived [in Chicago] [for] [seven] [years] [, and] [of] course _it was_ [definitely] _there_ [. So] [when] [we] _first moved_ [here] [, it] wasn't [as] bad [as] [this] . It's [, you know [,] it's] [just] _getting_ [all] [of] [a] sudden [so much] worse [. I don't know] whether [it's] due [to] [the] drugs [and the] [, uh ,] drug kings [that] [are] [here] [and] Jamaican drug kings coming [in] [. I don't know] whether [that's] [it [,] or] [street] gangs [. [I don't know] what] [the] answer [is] [. [I] [know] that] [it's] scary [, and] [yet] [I] hate [the] [government] constantly telling [me] [what] [I] [can] [do] [and] [what] [I] [can't] [do [,] [and] that's] [basically] [what] [the] gun control [would] end [up] being . 
B|111| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|112| A: [I mean [,] we] [are] [all] different [so ,] 
B|113| B: [Uh-huh ,] yeah [. Uh [,] [I] , um , I] _used to_ _, uh , I_ _used to_ weigh [, uh ,] two hundred fifteen pounds [, and] now [I] weigh [only] [about] [one] _, about_ [one] seventy-five . [Um] [, [so] I] drastically [had to] change [the] way [I] ate [when] [I ,] [when] [I] [first moved] [to] [college] [, and _, uh ,] [I_ had] [started] _weight_ lifting quite regularly [, and] [so I] [got] [my] _weight_ [down] [, and] [it's] [kind of] easy [for me to] forget [about] [it] now [, [because] [,] uh [, you] know ,] [when] [I'm not] fat [like I] _used [to_ be] [I don't] worry [about] [it] 
A|114| A: [my] [, uh ,] girlfriends [do] catering [and they] [always] [, about] [every] party [they] [do] [is] [they] [have a] vegetable tray [. [I] think they] try [and] suggest [it .] 
B|115| B: _Okay [._ Yeah .] 
A|116| A: [That's] _very_ true _very_ true . Who knows [, we] maybe [want to] overthrow [the] [government] 
B|117| B: [Uh ,] Grapevine _, do [you_ know] Grapevine ? 
A|118| A: [my] kid [will] [do] [four] [or] five hours [this] [week] [for [me] .] No [problem] . 
B|119| B: Cambodians [, uh ,] Asians , Vietnamese . We , we're [getting] _a lot [of_ , uh ,] Mexican Americans [, you know ,] we've [had] , those [for] [a] long [time .] 
A|120| A: [I] bet 
B|121| B: [Right .] College credit [is] [a good] [idea] [because ,] 
A|122| A: [Oh ,] you're [used to] [that [,] too] . 
B|123| B: [Yeah .] 
A|124| A: Wonderful [place .] 
B|125| B: [So ,] anyway [, I guess] [we] [can't] talk [much] [more] [about] [that [,] but] [I just] [thought] [I'd] throw [that] [in] [there] 
A|126| A: [Okay .] 
B|127| B: [And] [we] [like] movies [, that] yeah . 
A|128| A: [Well [,] do you] [think] [people] _should_ [have a] trial [is] they're caught dead [to] rights [like ,] 
B|129| B: [Yeah .] 
A|130| A: Mustang G T [Uh ,] [can't] [afford] [it .] 
B|131| B: [But] [we] [don't] farm . 
A|132| A: He came [to] [the] conclusion , plastics [is actually] [one of the] biggest problems [in] landfills [cause] _it's [,_ it's] low [weight] [, but] [it's] high volume [so] [it] takes [up] [a lot of] space 
B|133| B: [Uh-huh .] Yes . 
A|134| A: [Yeah _,] uh-huh_ 
B|135| B: [Uh-huh [,] uh-huh] [. [I] [,] I] agree we're [the] largest munitions producer [in the] world [, and] [so [,] uh [,] there's [a] lot of] money [to be] [made] [there] [, and] [it's [,] uh ,] [be] [very] difficult [to] , [to] cut [it back] [to] [a] [, a] level [where] [it] [should] [be] . 
A|136| A: [Well ,] great [, well] [look] [, uh , [I] know] [it's] [probably] late [for] [you] , 
B|137| B: [Wow .] 
A|138| A: _And so_ [she] asks [the same] questions _over and_ _over_ again . Which [is not] [you know ,] unrealistic . 
B|139| B: [and they] [had a] wonderful [, uh ,] program [that] [started] [at] age [three] [and [it] was] [about] [a] block away [from the] hospital [where] [I work] [. [And so] ,] many times , [at] lunchtime [, I would] [go] [over and] visit [the] children [and] eat with [them] [and] [see] [what] [they were] [doing] [. And] [they] [had] wonderful [, they] [had] [things like] gardens [and] lots [of] pets [and] [just [,] they] [had a] [four] [to] [one] [uh ,] teacher [student] ratio . 
A|140| A: [And , uh] . 
B|141| B: [and] [like] she's washing
