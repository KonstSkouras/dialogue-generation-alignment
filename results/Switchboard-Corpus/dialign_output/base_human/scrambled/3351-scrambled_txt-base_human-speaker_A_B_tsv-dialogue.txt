B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] _Yes_ . 
A|30| A: [I] [have [,] so I] [have] [to] take [that] into consideration _when I_ evaluate [like] how [much] [I] get _paid_ [you know ,] [because] _if_ _I was_ working somewhere else I'd [have] _to _,_ you know ,_ _pay_ [an] extra five percent , [or] [so] .

B|39| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . 
A|40| A: [Yes , yes] , I've known [people] [with] effectively worthless degrees _in this_ country [. _I] mean [,_ and] they're highly educated [people] [, but] [of] course , [if you're] educated [and] [you] don't speak English , no [one] thinks anything [of] [you] . 
B|41| B: _It's_ [a] legal job [, you know] 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: Right . Right . [Oh ,] definitely motherhood [is] devalued [in this] society . If [you're] , stay at [home] [and] [you're] [a] mother _, it's_ [like] _what_ [a] waste . People [think] [, you know , you] should be fulfilling yourself

B|45| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: _Yeah_ . 
A|48| A: [and] _they_ _, oh _,_ the_ old-timer made [with] [the] _old_ [way] [and] nobody respects [the] traditions . _And [,_ you know [,] it's] [I] [, I'm] [not] saying _that I_ _do_ either [but] [you know [,] it's] [just] funny

A|50| A: Unless somebody [is] trying [to] blackball _them ._ 
B|51| B: [Well] [then] tell me [do you] consider yourself [a] liberal ? 
A|52| A: [Oh .] 
B|53| B: [and] [that [I] was] [when [I] was] [a] baby [but] _so ,_ Morocco [I think] would be [wonderful] [because] [that's] [, you know [,] that's] [, that] [area] [of] [the] world [I think] would be great . 
A|54| A: [No] , no . 
B|55| B: [and] [so] [we] used [to] [just] save [them up] [and] [then] they'd _come_ [around] [and] we'd [give them] [to] [them .] 
A|56| A: All [right] . I've never done [it] [before [,] so I guess that's] [all] [I] [have] [to] [do] , [right] 
B|57| B: [Uh-huh] , uh-huh . _Yeah_ . See [there ,]

A|62| A: [Yeah ,] _are_ _they_ , um [, just] house pets ? 
B|63| B: _The_ whole _family_ [was] [so] disappointed 
A|64| A: That's [a] good idea [. We] ought [to ,] [Yeah [,] and] maybe [when] _the other_ brothers [and] sisters retire [or whatever [,] I] don't [know] [what] they're [going to] [do] . [It's] really [not] _my_ [family] . [It's] _my_ fiancee's [so I] don't [, I] can't [say] [much] . 
B|65| B: [Well ,] [now] [it's] [in] pretty disastrous shape for sure . 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|67| B: [And] [we] [are] [very] conscious [of] , most [of] [us] [are] [very] conscious [of] , [of] [, uh ,] sanitation aspects , [whatever] you've [got] [to] carry for any distance . 
A|68| A: [Oh .] 
B|69| B: [And] [the other] room [we] use as [a] guest bedroom [because] [my] husband's [family] _come_ . His parents _come_ [and] also [the] [kids] [have] friends who _come_ [and] stay 
A|70| A: Do [you] [have a] favorite instrument ? 
B|71| B: [It's] thirty-five , thirty-six years [old] [when] [they] used [to] build [like] [that] [, and , uh ,] 
A|72| A: [we] [got] lucky [. We] [had] no damage [to] our house [or] anything [so ,] [The] rest will [just] [have] [to] [come] [with] time . 
B|73| B: [And] unfortunately [the] [the ,] lately [the] courts [have] been deciding [that] those [could] be [paid] for by insurance too . 
A|74| A: [this] [is] [not] , these aren't _cats , you know ,_ 
B|75| B: Is [that] [right] ? [Oh ,] neat , 
A|76| A: Okay 
B|77| B: [when [I] was] growing [up] [we] [had] [cats] [and [,] you know [,] just] seeing [the] [cats , you know [,] [the] [,] the] miracle [of] birth [, you know ,] put [that] [in] quotes , [is] [that's] [a] [, that's] [a] neat thing [to ,] [to] experience as [a] kid [and] understand ,
