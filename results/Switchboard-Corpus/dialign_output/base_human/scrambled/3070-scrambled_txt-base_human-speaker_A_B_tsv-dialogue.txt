A|90| A: [I] [have] heard stories [, uh ,] from [other] parents [that [I] know] [of] , [their] children [are] [in] high school [that] teachers [are] [out] [there] giving drugs [and] selling drugs , 
B|91| B: [Right] 
A|92| A: [Huh .] 
B|93| B: [Uh] [, [and] I] planted potatoes [too] . 
A|94| A: [I mean ,] [these] [are] [people] who [don't] [have] [the] foggiest idea [about] [what] America's [like] .

A|100| A: It's [, it's] less painful [and] less expensive . 
B|101| B: [Well] [we] always wait until [we] [can] rent [them] [, you know] 
A|102| A: [Right] , [that's] [a] [good] idea . 
B|103| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh [.] [I] was] born [in] Saudi Arabia [and , uh ,] [when] [my] father worked [there] [we] [, they] used [to] travel quite [a] bit [, all] around [you know [,] [in] [,] in] Europe [and] whatnot ,
