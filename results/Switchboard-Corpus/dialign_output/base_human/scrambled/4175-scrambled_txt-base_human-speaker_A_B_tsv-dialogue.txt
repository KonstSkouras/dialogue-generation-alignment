A|46| A: Pardon ? 
B|47| B: So [we] _put_ [a] _three_ car garage [in] . 
A|48| A: [And] [they] tend [, and] since anyone can get [out] [of] [it] who basically [says] [they] [don't] [want] [to] do [it [,] _I] mean_ _, you know , it's_ _, it's_ anyone can get [out] [of] jury just [about] [, [and , uh] [,] so [,] it _,] it's_ [, uh _,] it's_ [not] _really_ [my] peers _that ,_ _if_ [I] were let's [say I] were arrested falsely _or_ [not] [and] [put] [up] _for a_ jury [I] wouldn't _feel that [, uh ,_ I] _would_ [be] being tried by [a] jury _of my_ peers . 
B|49| B: _I think it's_ great [. _I] love_ watching [a] microbiologist fighting [off] with [a] policemen [or _something] else [,_ and] competition . _I'm_ _going_ oh , great [, you know , _it's] a_ [, _it's] a_ great role model [for] everybody .

A|54| A: [Yeah [,] _I] [,_ uh , I] ethically [don't] [like] [the] idea [but ,] [or] [I] should [say] morally [I don't] [like] [the] idea [, but , uh ,] social [and] ethics , socially [and] ethically [I think [it's] _a] good_ idea [, in] certain crimes . 
B|55| B: [Yeah ,] [my] name's Bill [. Well ,] 
A|56| A: [Well [,] uh _, I] think_ she's mostly German Shepherd _. [Uh_ ,] she _was _, uh _,_ uh ,_ a_ [person] lives across [the] street [from] [me [,] uh ,] brought _her_ _home_ [from] [work] because [a] coworker [of] hers [, uh _,] had_ [this] dog appear _on_ its _front_ doorstep , 
B|57| B: [Yeah [,] it's] [really] neat _. And [, uh ,_ uh ,] [course] I've [been] working [on] [it] [for] five years [, but [,] you know ,] 
A|58| A: [Right] [, [and] then [,] you know ,] sometimes [we] _try to_ do our lesson [on] Sunday night [and then] our activity [or something] [on] Monday [but ,] [We're] [, it's] [real] important [to] us [to] spend [time] together . 
B|59| B: Huh ? 
A|60| A: [Oh ,] yeah [Yeah .] 
B|61| B: [Well] [now] [that ,] [is] [that , uh ,] that's related [to] _the [,_ the] aerobic [, uh ,] , 
A|62| A: [I went] , well [I] did [work] _, um ,_ just very [for] [some] [time] _but I_ didn't make enough money [to] [really] make , too much _of a_ difference . 
B|63| B: [Uh [,] I] remember seeing [that ,] 
A|64| A: [and , and] [you] [put] [the] _chicken_ [in] _, then_ pour [the [,] uh ,] broth over [and] [you] can [put] mushrooms [in] _if you_ [want] [, [and] then] [you] just . 
B|65| B: [And] I've never [been] sorry , 
A|66| A: [so] _. [Uh_ ,] do 
B|67| B: _But [,_ I think] [people] [try to] , [on] , [on] T V [I think] [, they] [try to] throw [in] [good] stuff [, but] [it] doesn't [, uh [,] it] doesn't sway [the] _vote_ . 
A|68| A: Because _one of my_ neighbors [, uh ,] did [that] [in] Pittsburgh , [from] Pittsburgh . 
B|69| B: [Yeah [,] [and ,] and] [now] _I'm_ looking [for a] job before [they _have] to_ send [me] _back_ [home] 
A|70| A: _Well [, I_ guess] [then [,] I] will _go_ _, but I ,_ 
B|71| B: _But [, uh ,_ uh ,] [he] [, and he] does [a good] job [and he] , [he] , [he] [, uh ,] guarantees [everything] [he] sells . 
A|72| A: Which [one] ? 
B|73| B: [Well , I] _I'm_ [a] physician [. Uh] [and ,] [as] [is] [my] husband . 
A|74| A: [Well , [I] don't know] _if_ [I] [know] anything [or] [not] , 
B|75| B: No , no _. And_ [this] woman [was , uh ,] stocking [the] shelves [in] [a] drugstore . 
A|76| A: Of [course] , [I'm not] [a] carpenter [or] anything [like] [that .] They _could_ probably come [in] [and] [say ,] gee , [this] [is] [not] straight [and] [this] [is] under [something] [but ,] 
B|77| B: [I guess] [we] [kind of] started recycling _after_ [I] moved [here] [about a] year [and a half] ago . 
A|78| A: _Yeah . [I_ think] [one] thing [that] _maybe_ _would_ help [people] [vote] [is] _if_ [the] polls were _either_ open more days , [or] [you] _could_ _mail_ _it in_ , [or something] [like ,] _if you_ [have] , _if you_ [have] [real] strict [work] hours [, and] [you] can [only] _go_ [like] [at] seven [in the] morning [or] [after] [work] [and] [you] [have to] stand [in] line [for] [so] long 
B|79| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|80| A: [Well , I] _would_ assume , too [, _I] mean_ , you've got [three] [or] four months [you're talking about] [of [,] of] bad weather . 
B|81| B: [Well] [that] sounds [kind of] dumb . 
A|82| A: [And] . [Yeah .] 
B|83| B: [And] [so] many [people] _when_ [they] [put] [people] [in the] nurses [home] [, they] never see [them] . 
A|84| A: [Uh ,] 
B|85| B: [I'm] trying [to] remember , [he] [, um [,] had] [her] [in the] car [in] [front] [of a] Taco [or something] 
A|86| A: [and , uh ,] return offenders [have] , they've actually waited [for] [them] , [where] they've robbed [, you know ,] particular neighborhood , they'll rob [one] house _, then_ other [people] will wait [up] [, you know , and] wait [for] _somebody_ [to] do [something else ,] [try to] take _it in_ their own hands . 
B|87| B: [Right] . 
A|88| A: [Yeah .] Has Herschel Walker done much [for] [them] ? 
B|89| B: _But , uh ,_ 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|91| B: What , [what] [if] [you're] [not] doing [it in] order [to] circumvent [the] law [though] ? [I mean] [what] [if you] [don't] even realize [that] [you're] subject [to] paying [, uh ,] income tax [on] [something] [that you] purchase [mail] order ? 
A|92| A: [I guess] [you] heard our our topic [for] today [was] clothing ? 
B|93| B: [Right] . So [, uh [,] but I [,] I] [feel that [, uh ,] [a] lot] [of] [people] [have] gotten lazy [about] voting . 
A|94| A: [Yeah [,] I think] [in] our [, in] our particular neighborhood , vigilantism [is] becoming [a real] , [real] possibility . 
B|95| B: [That's] [one of my] husband's pet peeves . He doesn't understand why [somebody] [would] [go] [to] [a] seafood place [and] eat [either] [chicken] [or] steak [, you [know] .] 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh [.] [Well ,] I] do [. I] just [, [I] love] [it] . It's such [, I] just [think it's] such [a] [fun] sport [. And , uh ,] [I'm] just hoping [that] [the] Broncos can get [back] [on] their feet [. We're] [not] convinced [that] [we're] [going] [to] [be] Cowboy fans yet . [But , uh ,] 
B|97| B: [Yeah . I] [could] see [that [,] then] [maybe] . 
A|98| A: [Yeah ,] [when I] [had a] Cocker Spaniel [it [,] [it] was] an outdoor dog [and [, uh [,] I] think] [I] liked [that] better . 
B|99| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|100| A: [Oh ,] how beautiful [, and] [it's] [pretty] flat [there] ?
