B|1| B: _Well , _I_ know_ _that _we_ have_ _some_ relatives [that] [live] around , _like_ _the_ _area_ _in there ,_ 
A|2| A: _Huh-uh ._ 
B|3| B: _I know_ _they're_ [doing] _some_ _curbside recycling_ as _a_ _kind of_ _a_ test _there ._ 
A|4| A: _Yeah ._ You _know [,_ I] read _, you know , when_ _they_ first _started_ [doing] [that] [in] [the] paper _, and I_ read _about_ [that] [, I] _was_ _just_ praying [that] _, that_ _would_ _be_ [in] _our_ [area] _, because_ we've been [recycling] _for_ quite [some] time _.

B|5| B: [Huh-uh .] 
A|6| A: So _if_ _they_ _would_ come _up_ , [curbside recycling] , 
B|7| B: they'll help _you ,_ recycle _, because we_ _, there_ [is] [some] bins , _like_ _behind Wal-Mart_ [, that] _take_ [some] _things_ . 
A|8| A: [Well ,] now [have] _they moved_ _them_ [behind Wal-Mart] ? 
B|9| B: [Yeah .] 
A|10| A: _Oh_ , God . 
B|11| B: _Because_ [I] finally asked [because] [, you know , we] _had_ _all of_ those _milk cartons _and_ there was_ nowhere _else_ _to take_ [them] [and] _they had_ [it] [in] front [of] [Wal-Mart] [and I] ask _in Wal-Mart_ [and] [they] said [they moved] [it] [just] [behind] . 
A|12| A: _Oh _._ That's_ really _nice to_ [know [,] because we] _were doing_ [the] same _thing ._ [Because] _to take _it_ to_ [a] Metco [, you] [have] _to take it_ _when_ [they're] open [, you know ,] which [is] always [a] real pain . 
B|13| B: [Huh-uh .] 
A|14| A: _And_ _so_ _when_ [that] _thing_ came _up_ [in Wal-Mart] parking lot [, we] thought , oh , _this_ [is] great _. And_ [we] _started_ taking [them] _up_ [there _.] And_ then , [all] [the] sudden _, it_ disappeared [, you know] [I] didn't _know _._ And_ we're _going_ , oh , no [, there] goes _our_ [recycling] _place_ . 
B|15| B: [Yeah .] 
A|16| A: _That's_ really _nice to_ find _out_ [that] it's [behind] [there] [Well [,] we] pretty _much_ _do_ _, um ,_ plastic [milk cartons _and] , um _,_ um _,_ um ,_ _newspapers_ _. I_ couldn't even _think_ _of what_ [you] call [them] . 
B|17| B: [Yeah .] 
A|18| A: Plastic [milk cartons] , _newspapers_ [and] _cans_ _, and_ glass _, I guess _,_ is the_ four _, is_ really [the] four [things] [that _we] do_ . 
B|19| B: Like _aluminum cans_ ? 
A|20| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|21| B: [That's] [about what] [we do] _too ._ 
A|22| A: _And_ really , that's [about] , that's really [about] _it ._ Is [there] _anything_ , any _place_ [else] [that] really takes _anything_ other than [that] [, that] [you know] [of] ? 
B|23| B: _Well [, I_ guess [,] um ,] _down_ [in] , _kind of_ [in] North Dallas [, there] [is a] [place] _that will_ [take] almost [anything] . 
A|24| A: _Oh_ , really . 
B|25| B: Uh [, I don't] _, we just_ [don't] [have] [the] room [to] store [all] [that] [much] [, you know ,] 
A|26| A: [I _know] ._ 
B|27| B: [I don't] want [to] [be] running _down_ [there] every week [, or] whatever . 
A|28| A: [I _know] _._ I _know_ ._ We're [kind of] [the] same way . You [know ,] _at_ first [, you know [,] [you] ,] _at_ first _it was_ [a] real _, it was_ [a] real hassle _, and_ _I'm_ wondering are [we] really _going _to_ do_ _this_ , but [you] [kind of] _get_ [, I guess ,] into [a] little routine [, you know ,] _where_ [it] becomes _, is_ automatic , now , [to] throw , different [things] [in] different _places_ , 
B|29| B: [Yeah .] 
A|30| A: _you know ._ So [I] [just] go [, you know , [we] _have] a_ pretty good size pantry [in] _our_ kitchen [and] I've [just] got three trash [cans] sitting [in there [,] you know [, we] just] [kind of] _dump_ [things] [in] each one _, if_ _, you know , if_ [we] _get_ [them] , 
B|31| B: [Yeah .] 
A|32| A: _so_ . 
B|33| B: Those [milk cartons] [take] [up] [so] [much] room . 
A|34| A: _Oh_ _, they_ [do] , [too _.] And_ [they're] impossible [to] crush _. I_ mean [, you] can't _get the_ [down] [to] any size _, you know ._ If [you] _get_ four [milk cartons _and] that_ fills [up] trash bag [, you know] pretty easily , [so] . You [know ,] 
B|35| B: [I guess] [we] [kind of] [started] [recycling] after [I] [moved] _here_ [about] [a] year [and] [a] half ago . 
A|36| A: _Oh_ , really . 
B|37| B: We [were] using baby food _and there was_ [so] many baby food jars , [kind [of] what] [started] [it .] 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: Some [of] [our] neighbors [were doing] [it] [and] _so [,_ you know , when] [I] found [out] [some] [places] [to take _it] [,_ [and] , um ,] _like [,_ um [,] they] also [take] [some] [things] [at] [the] Flower Mound [dump] [behind] [the] fire station [there [,] and [I] know] [that] [they're] _going to use_ [, you know ,] _the money_ [for] _that to_ build [some] [kind of] multipurpose field [and that] type [of] [thing .] Put lights [and] stuff 
A|40| A: _Oh_ [, [that] will] [be] good . 
B|41| B: _so [,_ you know , if] [I'm] not [going to] [get _the] money_ [for] _aluminum_ [, I] [would] [just] assume _give_ [it to] [the] city [of] Flower Mound . [to do] _something_ _with [, you know_ .] 
A|42| A: Sure . Let somebody [get] [something] [out] [of] [it .] 
B|43| B: [Yeah [.] That's] true _. And they_ won't raise [our] taxes . 
A|44| A: [Yeah] 
B|45| B: [Yeah .] 
A|46| A: Ha-ha [Well , I] [was] [kind of] hoping [with [, you know] ,] [do] [you] work [for] T [I] ? 
B|47| B: _No_ [, I don't] [. I] [have a] friend , [of] mine told me [about] [this] program [, is the] reason [that] [I'm] , 
A|48| A: [No] . [Yeah .] There [was] [a] , T [I] has got [this] organization called T A D which [is] T I'ers Against Drugs [. And] [, you know ,] we're [recycling] [aluminum cans] [up] [here] [and ,] uh , [just] [what] [you] [would] buy [out] [of] [the] machines [and] drink [here] [and there was] crushers [out] [in] [all of] [the] hallways [you know [,] and] that's [, they] [use] [the money] from [that to] fund [this] T I'ers Against Drugs Program . It's [, you know ,] T [I] doesn't [give] [them] any [money] , [all] , everything [is] made from [that] [. And [they] had] talked [about] having [a] [thing] [like ,] one Saturday [a] month [, you] could come [and] drop your [aluminum cans] off from home [, you know ,] 
B|49| B: [Yeah .] 
A|50| A: [And] [I'm] [kind of] [like ,] yeah [. I] shall [, they] [would] [do] [that] [because] [at] least somebody [was] getting [the money] [out] [of] [it [,] you know .] That [was] [going to use] [it] [for] good , [so ,] 
B|51| B: [is] talking [to] someone [in] Sorry .

B|53| B: She'll [be] _two in_ July .

B|57| B: [Well , it was] [nice [to] talk to you [.] I know] they've [started] over [in] Richardson [where] my dad lives . They _pick up_ [newspapers] [, I] [think] . 
A|58| A: [Oh] , [do] [they] really . Curbside [pick up] ? 
B|59| B: [Yeah .] 
A|60| A: [I] really hope [they] [do] [that] [in] Louisville . It [would] make [it] [a] lot easier on [all of] us . Talk [to you] later .
