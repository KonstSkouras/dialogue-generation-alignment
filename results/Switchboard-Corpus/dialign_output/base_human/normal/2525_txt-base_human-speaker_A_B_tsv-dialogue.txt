A|0| A: Okay . 
B|1| B: All _set_ . Do _you_ _want to_ _start_ ? 
A|2| A: _I_ can _go ahead_ _and_ [start] , 
B|3| B: Sure , [go ahead] . 
A|4| A: _uh , in_ _Dallas_ _there's_ definitely _a crime_ problem _, I_ _know_ _it's _,_ you know ,_ worse _in the_ larger _cities ._ Um _, it's_ _kind _of_ a_ concern _for_ _me_ _, in fact_ , _at the_ moment _I'm_ thinking _of_ possibly moving _to a_ new apartment _and , uh _,_ _it's_ _,_ I_ am single _and_ female _, you_ definitely _are_ _going to_ worry _about_ _the_ location _, _and _,_ uh ,_ you know ,_ accessibility _of_ _people_ _to be_ able [to] break _in_ _. I_ _live_ _on_ _a_ third floor _now_ _, _but_ _,_ I _,_ you know _,_ I'm_ real concerned _that_ _I , I don't_ [want _to] be_ _on_ _a_ _first_ floor _where_ [you] can _have_ problems _with_ _things_ _like_ _that _, _and_ _,_ the_ _,_ um ,_ 
B|5| B: Do _they have_ _many_ _buildings_ [that] [have] security _there_ ? 
A|6| A: Some [buildings] _do_ _, it_ depends _on the_ location . _The_ _area_ _I_ _live_ _in_ _right_ _now_ , _is ,_ _is_ real _good_ _as far as_ _crime_ rate _is_ concerned _and _we_ _don't_ have_ _anything_ _at_ _all_ _, no_ burglar alarms _, no_ guards . 
B|7| B: _Yeah _,_ yeah _,_ well_ [I , _I] went to_ _Dallas [,_ uh ,] when [I] worked _for T I_ [in] Abilene [and , uh [,] I'm] _a little_ familiar [with] [the] _city_ [area] , Forest Lane [and [,] you know ,] through [that ,] _off_ , _off_ [the] freeway . 
A|8| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|9| B: _And_ [, uh [,] it] didn't seem [like] _it was_ [that] congested [in] _that , that_ part . You [know] _because_ [to] [me] [where] [we] [live] _out_ _here_ [in the] north east [, _it] [,_ it's] _there_ [are] _a lot of_ [buildings] _very_ close [to] each other , 
A|10| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: [and] [the] [cities] [are] _very_ populated [with] tenement housing , [where] _there_ [are] _more_ than one family [in] [a] house _. And_ [with] [the [,] uh ,] [people] _that are_ coming into [the] _country_ _from_ other _countries_ _, not_ knowing [the] language 
A|12| A: _Uh-huh ._ Um . 
B|13| B: [and , uh _,] they're_ [going _to] the_ _big [cities_ _.] It_ makes [it] _very_ difficult . 
A|14| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|15| B: _It_ _really_ does [, _and ,] and_ I've seen [the] same thing [that] you're talking [about] [, uh ,] _much_ _more_ [crime] than ever before . Drugs [of] course [, uh ,] [a] _big_ part _of it_ _I think_ . 
A|16| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: _And_ [, uh [,] I don't] [know ,] _a lot of_ younger _people [,_ you know ,] into _more_ violent crimes . 
A|18| A: _Oh [,_ yeah [,] yeah] . 
B|19| B: [that _,] _that's_ really sad_ [, you know [,] you] got young boys _or_ girls _, that_ [at] fourteen _or_ twelve years old _that are_ committing murders [and [,] no] remorse , _what_ _so_ ever . 
A|20| A: _Uh-huh ._ There's [a lot of] [that] [going] _on_ [in] [Dallas ,] _too_ . 
B|21| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|22| A: [Yeah [,] it's] [really sad] . 
B|23| B: _It_ [is] _and _, and_ [I_ don't] [know] _if_ [it's [,] uh [,] the] family [, you know ,] thing [where] _they're_ _not_ bonding anymore , [where] mothers [are] working _all the_ time [and , the] kids aren't _getting_ [the] attention [that] _they_ need _, or_ [the] television . 
A|24| A: _Uh-huh_ , _Uh-huh ._ 
B|25| B: _And_ [I , I] [really] _think that_ we're , we're falling _by_ [the] wayside [with] _not_ incarcerating _these_ [people] . 
A|26| A: _Oh , I_ agree _. _I_ think that _people_ are_ [getting] [off] _too easy ._ They're [getting] [, they're] [getting] paroled _too_ easily . 
B|27| B: _Uh _,_ uh ._ 
A|28| A: They're just [getting] [, uh ,] _put_ _on_ probation [or] something _, because_ [the] prisons _don't have_ _enough_ room [so] _they get_ _, they get_ lighter sentences , 
B|29| B: [Yeah ,] exactly . 
A|30| A: [and] _some_ [of] those [people _,] _they_ don't_ _deserve to be_ let loose . 
B|31| B: _And_ [, uh , you know [,] they] _had [,_ [uh [,] in] fact] [on the] news last _night_ [we] _were_ watching _this_ [, uh ,] man who lost his _ten_ year old daughter . He ran _out_ _to the_ store _for a few minutes _and_ he_ _had_ _left_ her home alone . [now] _ten_ years old , she's old [enough] [to be] alone _for a few minutes_ [, you know] . 
A|32| A: _Oh [,_ yeah] . 
B|33| B: _And_ while _he_ _was_ gone , _he_ _had_ looked , _went_ looking _for a_ job [and] stopped [at the] store _, that's_ _what _it_ was_ _. And_ [, uh ,] someone who _was_ [in the] neighborhood cleaning carpets , _these_ two men , _went_ [in] , raped [the] _girl ,_ murdered her [, and] [the] whole bit . 
A|34| A: _Oh_ my gosh . 
B|35| B: _And_ one [of] [the] men got [, uh [,] [I] think] _it was_ seventeen years [and] [the] other one _was_ [in] [for] [, uh _,] life_ imprisonment . 
A|36| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|37| B: [The] one [that] _was_ [in] [for] [the] seventeen years , actually served seven [, and] he's _out ._ 
A|38| A: [Uh [,] that's] terrible . 
B|39| B: _And the_ man _said _,_ that [,_ you know _,] if_ [it] weren't [for] [the] [fact] [that] _he_ _would_ [go] [to] jail _, that_ _he_ _would_ eliminate _this_ person himself _. And_ then [go] [to] McDonalds [and] _have a_ hamburger [and] _not_ thing [a] thing , [think] [a] thing [about] _it ._ 
A|40| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|41| B: _And_ _I mean , [I_ think that] _what_ _this_ [is] [going to] lead [to] [is] [people] _will_ _take_ [things] into _their_ own hands _. And_ [that] innocent [people ,] 
A|42| A: [Yeah .] 
B|43| B: [I , I] _shouldn't_ say innocent [, because] _I mean ,_ actually _if_ [they] commit [a crime] [that] [they're] [in the] same _circumstances_ [but ,] 
A|44| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|45| B: [the] reasons [that] [they're] doing [it] compared _to the_ reason someone else _is in_ jail [for] _it [,_ you know [,] it's] [like] two different [things] . 
A|46| A: [Yeah .] 
B|47| B: Sometimes when [you] lose someone _that you_ [really] love [, you] _do some_ crazy [things] [I don't] [know ,] 
A|48| A: Right [, it's] [a little] [more] understandable under [the] [circumstances] [, I] guess . 
B|49| B: [I , I] [like] [the] idea [that [,] uh _,] if_ someone [is] _from_ [a] foreign _country_ [, _and] they_ _come_ [to] _this_ _country_ [and] [uh ,] commit , [a _crime] [,_ [I] think that] irregardless [of] whether _they have_ already become [a] citizen _or anything_ [, they] _should_ [be] immediately deported . 
A|50| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|51| B: Especially _if they're_ found guilty [of] _the crime_ . 
A|52| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|53| B: You [know ,] once _they , _they_ have_ been arrested _and if_ [they] [know] beyond [a] shadow [of a] doubt , _these_ [people are] guilty . 
A|54| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|55| B: That's _it _,_ [we_ don't] _take care of_ _them_ _, [we_ don't] support _them_ , _nothing_ , 
A|56| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|57| B: _I mean_ [they] [go] [right] _back_ [where] [they] came _from_ . 
A|58| A: Right [, _we] have_ [enough] , [enough] problems [with] overcrowding [in the] jails _as_ [it] _is ._ So let , let [their] [country] [take care [of] [it] .] 
B|59| B: Exactly [and ,] 
A|60| A: We _don't have_ [, I] guess _too_ [much] trouble [in] [Dallas] _with _,_ well [,_ I] guess [, I] guess [we] [do] [have [a] lot of] [people] [come] [in] [from] Mexico [, that] cause problems _, [but_ [,] uh .] 
B|61| B: _But_ [that's] [, uh [,] they're] , [so] close [, [I ,] I don't] consider Mexican [people] [in the] same category [with [,] uh ,] _especially_ [like] [, uh ,] [people] who [come] [from] cultures [that] [don't _have] the_ same [, uh ,] [kind of] moral upbringing [that] [we have] . 
A|62| A: [Yeah .] _Uh-huh ._ 
B|63| B: Like [you] [take] Asian _countries_ _, or_ [, uh [,] the] Eastern _countries_ [where] women [are] _like [in_ the] foreground [, [uh _,] in] the_ background [and] [the] men [are] [in the] foreground , 
A|64| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: [and] [it's] [like] [, you know [,] um [,] they] [live] _back in_ [where] [we] came [from] two hundred years ago . 
A|66| A: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
B|67| B: You [know ,] we've advanced beyond [that _, and] [I_ think that] [their] [, uh ,] mentality [as far as] _the way_ [they] treat _them_ [and] [that] [kind of] thing [, you _know] what_ _I mean_ . 
A|68| A: _Uh-huh [._ It] [was] _amazing_ [I went [to] the] Far East [, uh ,] [back in] October _to [do_ some] training [for T I] [and [I] ,] 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [uh ,] [some] [of] those [countries] [were] [so] safe [, [it] was] unreal . Singapore [is] [very] , supposed [to be] [very] safe [and [,] in fact] , Tokyo [, and I] thought Tokyo [would] [be] dangerous being such [a] huge large [city] [with] _so many_ [people ,] 
B|71| B: [Yeah .] 
A|72| A: _but they ,_ [at] , [at the] [T I] _there [,_ I] [said] [is] [there] any [area] [I] [should] avoid [. [And] the] guy [said] let [me] ask another [girl] [here] [and he] turned [and] asked [this] [girl [,] and] [said ,] can [you] [think] [of] any place [where] Dana [shouldn't] [go] [by] herself [, [or] anything] [. And] she , she thought [for a few minutes and] she [said [,] no] [. And] [he] [said] [is] [there] any place _you wouldn't_ [go] [by] yourself . She [said [,] no] [. And] [they] [said [,] it] [is] [so] safe [there] [that you] can _leave_ _your_ purse [on the] subway 
B|73| B: Wow . 
A|74| A: [and] somebody [will] turn [it] [in] [and , and] [nothing] [will] [be] missing _. They_ [said] [they] can just [about] guarantee [that] _there [,_ [that ,] that] [would] happen [if] [you] did _that _._ I_ thought , boy [, in] America [, if] [you] [left] [a] purse [on] [a] subway [, you] [would] never see [it] _again ._ 
B|75| B: Wow . You better _believe_ _it [,_ if] [, [you] wouldn't] even _have to_ [leave] _it [,_ _I] mean ,_ 
A|76| A: [Yeah [,] that's] true , 
B|77| B: [it] [would] [get] snatched [right] [off] [your] arm 
A|78| A: [that's] true . [But] [I] [was] thinking boy [, in] [Dallas [,] if] somebody asked [me] [if] [there] [were] places [you wouldn't] [go] [by] yourself [at] [night] , I'd _have to set_ [them] down [for] [about] five [or] [ten] [minutes] [to] list [all the] places [out .] 
B|79| B: [Oh] _sure_ . 
A|80| A: [I mean , I] couldn't [believe] [that] she couldn't [think] [of] any place _. They_ [said _,] the ,_ apparently [the [crime] ,] _is ,_ just [, uh ,] 
B|81| B: That's [amazing] [, well ,] what's [the] difference [there ,] [do] [you know] ? 
A|82| A: _I'm not_ [sure] [what it] [is] _there ._ Now [, I] [know [what] it] [is in] Singapore , [is] [they [have] _the] death penalty_ [and they] [really] enforce [it ,] 
B|83| B: [Oh [, [I] ,] I] [believe] [in [the] death penalty] [, I] [really] [do] . 
A|84| A: [like] [for] drugs _, for_ drugs [they , they] enforce [the death penalty] _for that ._ [Uh [,] they're] just , [very] , [very] tough [, and I] guess maybe _that's [the_ way] Tokyo [is] _too_ [, or] Japan [is] _too_ . They're just [very] tough [on] criminals . 
B|85| B: [Yeah _,] yeah , [I_ think that] we're [too easy .] 
A|86| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|87| B: [Uh [,] [and] we] [take] [the [,] the [,] uh ,] civil liberties [, uh ,] stuff [too] [far] . 
A|88| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|89| B: You [know] [like] [people] _that are_ [in] prison [, [I] mean] [we] didn't [put] [them] [there [.] They] [put] themselves [in] [that] situation . 
A|90| A: [Uh-huh] , oh [yeah] . 
B|91| B: [And] [as far as] [like] [them] [, uh ,] entertaining [the] rights [that] [they] [should] [have] . 
A|92| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|93| B: [I mean [,] we] educate [them] [, we] feed [them] [, we] [take care of] [them] [and they] [no] sooner [get] [out] [on the] street [and] [they're] [back in] [again .] 
A|94| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|95| B: [I'm not] saying [they're] [all] bad [, but] [I think] [people] who [are] guilty [of] [really] serious heinous crimes , [do] [not] [deserve to be] cared [for] [for] [the] rest [of] [their] lives . 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|97| B: [I think that] [they] [should] [be] [put] away . 
A|98| A: Right [, [and] [if] they're] overcrowded [, well [,] you know] [they] [shouldn't] [have] gotten theirself [there] [in _the] first_ place . 
B|99| B: Get rid [of] [them] . Exactly [. [I] , I] [really] [, [I ,] [I] think that] [that's the] whole key [here] . This plea bargaining baloney , [where] [, uh , you know [,] they] plead [to a] lesser [crime [,] or] [, uh [,] they] plead guilty [in] [, or] [, you know ,] tell [about] someone else [and [they] [, they] get] less time , 
A|100| A: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|101| B: Or [, [if] they're] [in] [there] [and] _they've_ got seventeen years [and] [they're] [on] [good] behavior [, for] every year [they're] [in] [they get] [so many] less [, you know [,] that] [they don't] serve [the] full [penalty] . 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|103| B: [I [, [I] ,] I] [really] [think] we're [going to] [far] overboard [with] [all] [of] [this] . 
A|104| A: [Oh [,] yeah , I] agree [, because] [it's] [not] fair [to] those [of] us [that , that] [deserve] [a] safe [, you know [,] life] [to] [have to] , 
B|105| B: [Yeah ,] same [with] drunk drivers . 
A|106| A: Right . 
B|107| B: [I think] [it's] [too easy] [for] [them] . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|109| B: That [if] [the [,] the] laws [, [and ,] and] [were] , [were] harsher [and] [were] enforced , 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [I mean] [you] [have to set] an example . You [have to] [start] somewhere . 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: [And] [I think that people] [know] [that] [they're] [going to] [get] [a] slap [on the] wrist [, they] might serve [a little] bit [of] time [and] [that] they'll [be] [out] [on the] street [again .] 
A|114| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: An [, [it] ,] an [I] feel bad [for] [the] _policeman_ [, because] he's [out] [there] every day facing _these_ [people] . This , [this] craziness [, you know ,] [people] [with [,] uh ,] automatic weapons [and , uh ,] [all] [this] other stuff [and] trying [to do] [a] job 
A|116| A: [Uh-huh .] Right . 
B|117| B: [and] let's face [it ,] [what] [do] [they get] paid . 
A|118| A: Right [, not] [much] . 
B|119| B: Twenty thousand dollars [a] year [, [if] they're] lucky [. I] [wouldn't] [do] [it] [for that .] 
A|120| A: [Yeah ,] huh-uh [, and] [especially] [not] [in] [some] [of] [these] [big cities] , [like in] [Dallas] [I mean] [they've] [had [,] they're] up [in the] top , top five [I think] [of] [cities] [that are] [getting] [policeman] killed [on] , [on] [, in the] line [of] duty [and] [that's really sad] . 
B|121| B: [It] [is [,] it] [really] [is [.] And] [I mean [,] they're] [the first] ones [that] [take] [the] brunt [of] everything . 
A|122| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|123| B: You [know [,] and] [I'm not] saying [that] [they're] [all] [good] either [, because] [there's] [good] [and] bad [in] everything , 
A|124| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|125| B: [but they [,] they're] already [, uh ,] [have] three strikes against [them] when [they're] [out] [there .] 
A|126| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|127| B: Because they'll arrest someone [and [,] you know ,] [go] through [all] [that] paperwork [and] writing [a] report [and] [all] [this] [, and] having [all] kinds [of] evidence [and] [you] [have to] even [be] careful how [you] arrest [them] , how [you] talk [to] [them] [, uh , you know ,] [what] [they] say ,
