B|3| B: _Uh ,_ _yes_ _. I , I_ _try_ _to_ grow _, uh _,_ uh , a_ vegetable [garden] _and ,_ 
A|4| A: _We_ [do] _the_ same thing . _It's_ [, I] _just_ _have a_ _small_ plot _it's_ _like_ _ten_ feet _by_ _five_ feet . 
B|5| B: _Yeah _._ _I_ have_ _two_ plots , one's [ten] [by] [ten] [and] one's [like] fifteen [by] _four_ . 
A|6| A: _I see ._ 
B|7| B: [It's] [a] _long_ skinny _one_ _and ,_ 
A|8| A: _Yeah , you_ [do] _a lot_ _more_ area than [I _do] ._ _I've ,_ [all] _the_ rest _of_ _my_ _yard_ , _backyard is _, uh ,_ you know ,_ pool [and] decking _it's_ [all] _the_ dirt [I _have] ,_ _left_ _in_ _my backyard_ 
B|9| B: _Oh , I see _._ Yeah _._ I see ._ 
A|10| A: [Well , _I] _I_ enjoy_ fiddling _around_ . [It's] cheap entertainment . 
B|11| B: _Right _._ _Right _._ Yeah_ _,_ it's_ _nice_ _to get out_ _in the_ open air . 
A|12| A: _It_ _is ,_ uh-huh . 
B|13| B: _And_ _especially_ _when_ [the] weather's _not_ _too_ _hot_ _or_ _, not_ raining _or_ whatever , 
A|14| A: _That's_ _right_ [. Yeah .] 
B|15| B: _but_ [, uh ,] sometimes _I , I_ said [, I] sometimes [I] wish _I had_ [more] _space_ _you know ._ 
A|16| A: _I enjoy_ , Excuse _me ,_ _go_ ahead _. Uh-huh ._ 
B|17| B: [I] grow _a lot of_ _things _,_ a lot of_ food . 
A|18| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|19| B: _And_ sometimes _I , I_ _want _to_ plant_ _something ,_ there's _not_ _enough_ _room_ _to plant_ . Some [of] _those_ _things like_ [, uh _, you know ,] the_ _things_ _that_ vine [like] [, uh ,] cucumbers , _or_ [, uh ,] squash _or _something_ _,_ _like_ that ._ Plant _one of_ _those_ 
A|20| A: _That's_ _right_ _. That's_ _right_ _. _Uh-huh ._ Uh-huh ._ Takes [a lot of] [room] . 
B|21| B: [and] _it _takes_ up_ _your_ _whole_ _space_ 
A|22| A: _It_ _sure_ does [. I] _made_ mistake [one] _year_ [and] _planted_ _some_ cantaloupe _, my_ goodness _, what_ [a] mistake [that] _was_ . 
B|23| B: _Yeah . Yeah _._ They_ , _they_ [just] run [all] over _, the_ place _, don't_ _they ,_ 
A|24| A: [They] _do ._ [Well _,] _it_ was_ very _good_ [it] [just] [takes _up] [, you know_ [,] _like] you_ _say_ [, a lot of] _your garden_ area . 
B|25| B: _Right _._ Right ._ 
A|26| A: [It's] [the] _first_ [and] _only_ _time_ _I've_ done [that _.] We_ [don't] [do] _anything_ exotic _we_ _just _do_ ,_ oh , _tomatoes_ , bell _peppers ,_ _radishes and_ turnips [, _I] mean [,_ not] turnips , carrots _, beets_ _and things like that ._ 
B|27| B: The basics _. _Right _._ Yeah ._ That's_ [what] [we] [do] _too ._ 
A|28| A: _My_ _wife_ used [to plant] _a few_ snow _peas_ [. _I] don't_ _really_ care _for_ snow _peas_ . [Well ,] _she_ [just] plants _a few_ _for_ herself . 
B|29| B: _Right ._ Peas 
A|30| A: [Yeah .] 
B|31| B: _I , _I_ _got_ a few_ [peas] _out_ _my garden_ [a] _couple of_ days ago . 
A|32| A: Did [you] _really_ ? 
B|33| B: The [first] [one] , _they_ started _them_ _indoors_ _this_ [time] [. I] read _it ,_ 
A|34| A: [Oh , I see .] 
B|35| B: _And_ _so _I_ ,_ 
A|36| A: _Okay_ _. We_ [don't] _start_ _anything_ [indoors] _we _,_ just_ _wait_ _until [,_ you know , the] weather warm [enough] [to] stick _it in the_ ground . 
B|37| B: [Yeah _.] I [,_ uh [,] _I] guess_ _you can get_ an earlier harvest [by] _doing that_ , 
A|38| A: Probably [so] [. _Yeah _,] you can_ get_ [a] head _start_ _on_ _it ._ [like] ice [in] 
B|39| B: _But_ [, uh _,] sure_ [is] [a] heck _of [a_ lot of] [work] . 
A|40| A: _I guess [it_ _,] [it_ ,] might _would ,_ 
B|41| B: Because [you] _got _to_ ,_ watch _them_ every _day_ _, and_ keep _them_ watered 
A|42| A: _yeah _._ Uh-huh ._ 
B|43| B: _and _I_ , I don't_ _think_ _I'll_ _do _it_ again_ 
A|44| A: [Well] [it] will make _, it_ will make [them] taste _better_ _I'm_ [sure] . 
B|45| B: _Oh , yeah [._ Yeah [,] [I] enjoy] [it [.] I] come _home_ from [work] _and _, and_ I_ usually [say] hello [to] [wife] [and] kids _, and_ _then_ [go] _out_ [and] fiddle [, you know [,] just] walk [around] [the] [yard] [and] _inspect it_ 
A|46| A: Sure . You [got to] [inspect [it] [,] yeah .] 
B|47| B: [and] [the] kids _want to_ swing , 
A|48| A: Sure . 
B|49| B: _and I_ push [them] [on] swing . 
A|50| A: Sure . 
B|51| B: _And_ [I I] mow _my own_ [lawn] . 
A|52| A: [Yeah .] 
B|53| B: _And_ [I [do] _,] I don't_ [have _a] sprinkler system_ _. I , I _don't_ enjoy_ watering . 
A|54| A: No . 
B|55| B: Especially , 
A|56| A: [I ,] [this] [is] [the] [first] [home] we've lived [in] we've _had [a_ sprinkler system] , 
B|57| B: [Oh] how , 
A|58| A: [and] boy _, it_ [is] _really_ [nice] , 
B|59| B: [Oh] . 
A|60| A: [it] [sure] beats dragging hoses [around] . 
B|61| B: [Yeah , you can] [have] [it] come [on] [just] early [in the] _morning_ _. _And_ _,_ and_ off [by] [the] [, you know ,] [by] _the time_ you're _up and_ _about_ . 
A|62| A: [That's] _right_ [. That's] _right_ . [It's] _really_ _nice ._ 
B|63| B: [Yeah _.] I , I_ usually _get it_ started _for _my_ wife_ 
A|64| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|65| B: _and [I_ _,] and_ [she] moves [it] [around] ever _other_ _day_ . 
A|66| A: [I'll] _have to_ admit [I don't] [, I do] [my own] [yard] [. I , _I] really [don't_ enjoy] [doing [that] [.] [I] enjoy] _having_ [a] [nice] looking [yard] , 
B|67| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [I] [just] [don't enjoy] [the] [work] _, that_ [it takes] [to [get] it] done . 
B|69| B: _Uh-huh . Yeah ._ 
A|70| A: _I had a_ [lawn] service _to do_ [my] [yard] [for] _me_ during [the] _real_ [hot] summer months [, you know _,] until_ [I] retired 
B|71| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|72| A: [and] _now_ [I ,] _I've_ lost [my] excuse [for] [that] [so [I] _have] to_ _for the_ last [couple of] _years_ _I've_ done [it] myself . 
B|73| B: [Yeah .] Sometimes [I] wish [I] could [get] _one of_ these [, uh ,] chemical services [to] come , _out_ [and] spray [for] weeds _, and_ fertilize _, and_ [all] [that] [and] _take_ [that] [one] step _out_ [of] . 
A|74| A: [Uh-huh . Yeah _.] _Uh-huh ._ Uh-huh ._ 
B|75| B: _But_ [, uh ,] _they_ _want_ _too much_ _money_ . 
A|76| A: _It_ [is] _kind of_ _expensive_ _, it_ [is] . 
B|77| B: [Yeah .] 
A|78| A: Of course [, the] chemicals themselves _when you_ buy _them _,_ they're_ _expensive_ [too .] 
B|79| B: _Right _._ Right ._ _But_ [it's] still _be_ quite [a] _bit_ cheaper _to do it_ yourself . 
A|80| A: [That's] _right_ . If _I have a_ _problem_ discipline _, you know _, I_ think ,_ _now ,_ boy [, _I] really_ need [to get out] [, you know [,] and] apply [something [,] you know [,] and I] screw [around] [and] [don't] [do it] [or] _wait_ [too] [long] [or something] . 
B|81| B: _Right_ [and] [the] weed come [up ,] 
A|82| A: [That's] _right_ . 
B|83| B: [and] [all] _of a_ sudden you've [got [to] _do] something_ else . 
A|84| A: [That's] _right_ . _I'm_ , _I'm_ _kind of_ bad [about] [that .] 
B|85| B: [Yeah .] 
A|86| A: [I] enjoyed _having_ [a] [lawn] service [but] _now_ [I have] [the time] [and _I] really_ _can't [,_ _I] really_ [you know [,] don't] , [want to] spend [the] [money] _for [it_ .] 
B|87| B: [Well ,] _if _you_ ,_ [enjoy] [it] _too [,_ you know _,] you [, you_ can [get] out] [in the] _morning_ [when] _, before_ [it] gets [hot] _and , and_ [do it] [and] stuff , [when you] [only] [have _to] ,_ 
A|88| A: [Yeah . That's] _right_ . _I'm_ [not] limited [to [,] just] mowing _it on_ Saturday [morning] [, you know ,] 
B|89| B: _Right ._ 
A|90| A: _I can_ [do _it] on_ most _any_ [day] _of the_ week . 
B|91| B: _When_ [the] days [start] getting _a little_ longer [, you know [,] you _can] [,_ [I] can] [start] [doing] [it in the] evening after [work] . 
A|92| A: [Uh-huh [.] That's] _right_ . 
B|93| B: _When_ _they ,_ [when] _they_ switch [to ,] switch , 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] 
B|95| B: _when we_ [get] an hour [more] , 
A|96| A: [Yeah .] 
B|97| B: [when] _they_ rollback an hour . 
A|98| A: [That's] _coming up here_ pretty _soon ._ Is [it] [this] weekend ? 
B|99| B: _I _don't know_ ._ 
A|100| A: [It's] pretty _soon ._ 
B|101| B: [I really _don't] know _._ It_ [just] seems [like] [I] [here] [it _on] the_ news [the] [day] _before_ . 
A|102| A: [Yeah .] 
B|103| B: _And , uh _,_ I [, I_ think] [it's] [coming up here] [soon .] 
A|104| A: [I] believe [it] [is] [too .] 
B|105| B: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
A|106| A: [Well ,] 
B|107| B: Are [you] [having] [any] trouble _with_ _bugs_ [in] , [in] [your [garden] ?] 
A|108| A: [Uh [,] not] [a] [whole] [lot] [, uh] [. I , I don't] use [, I , I] seldom use _anything_ harsher than seven dust [, [you know] .] 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [I don't] [really] _like to_ _put_ [a lot] chemicals [on] [it] [but] _then ,_ [again] [, I don't] [want] [the] [bugs] eating [it] upping either . 
B|111| B: _Right _._ Right [._ I [, I] [,] it] seems [like] _they_ come [in] spurts . 
A|112| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|113| B: _One_ [year] [I] _didn't_ [put] [anything] [on] [and I] _didn't have_ [any] problems . 
A|114| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|115| B: Next [year] _I was_ planting [some] broccoli _and , and_ [some] [of] _those_ [, they're] called cabbage , cabbage loppers , [or] whatever . 
A|116| A: [Uh-huh [.] Right _.] Uh-huh ._ 
B|117| B: [They] _were_ [just] covered _with_ [them ,] 
A|118| A: [Yeah .] 
B|119| B: [I mean [,] I] went [up [,] I] _didn't_ [go] _out there_ [for] [about] three days [, you know ,] because [I [,] and I] went _out there_ [one] [day] [and] [the] [plant] [was] nothing [left] [but] [a] stem , 
A|120| A: [Uh-huh [.] That's] _right_ . 
B|121| B: _they_ devoured _it that_ quickly . 
A|122| A: Absolutely [. They] [really] [go] through [it ,] 
B|123| B: _And ,_ _they ,_ _they ,_ [have _a] _,_ you [,_ a] [good] appetite 
A|124| A: [they] [really] _do [._ Yeah .] 
B|125| B: _And_ [they] [would [,] you know [, I] , I] picked off [like] twenty _of _them_ _and_ ,_ 
A|126| A: You [know] cutworms will [do] [the] same thing [to] [your] tomato vines [too .] 
B|127| B: [yeah .] 
A|128| A: Boy , they'll strip , 
B|129| B: [They] [got] [that] [, uh [,] what] [is] [that] safer soap [, uh ,] B T spray _this ,_ _year ._ 
A|130| A: [Uh-huh . Yeah _.] Uh-huh ._ 
B|131| B: _And_ [I've] been watching [them] every [day] _and [I've_ [,] and _I] haven't_ _seen_ [any] signs yet . So , _if_ [I see] [any] signs [I'm] _going to_ spray [them ,] 
A|132| A: [Yeah .] 
B|133| B: _and , uh ,_ 
A|134| A: [I] did [something] [a little] [bit] different _this _year_ that_ [I haven't] done [before] , _I've _got_ _,_ [my_ garden] [is] shaped [that] [I [can] [,] it's] _kind_ [like] [this [,] uh ,] _box_ shape , [so [I] got] [four] pieces [of] [two] [by] twelve [and] joined [them] together _and just_ _made_ _a box_ [. And] [put] [in] [a] [whole] _bunch_ [like] eight hundred _pounds_ [of] topsoil [and] manure 
B|135| B: [Right .] 
A|136| A: [and [,] you know ,] various [other] [things ,] Raised _it _up_ ._ 
B|137| B: [Well [,] the] [good] stuff [. Right .] 
A|138| A: [And] [I'm] hoping [especially] [with] [those] big tall sides [on] [there] [it that] maybe [I] won't _have ,_ oh , [I'll] [have] less [of a] bug _problem_ at least [they ,] they'll [have a] hard [time] crawling [up] [the] thing . 
B|139| B: _Right [. Yeah_ [,] [my] [backyard] is , uh ,] [is] sloping [so I] built [a box] [up , you know] [had] [to] build [the] [one] [, the] low _side_ [up .] 
A|140| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
B|141| B: _And , uh _,_ I had_ sandy _loam_ hauled [in] [. [I] had a] dump truck come [and] dump [it .] 
A|142| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|143| B: On [my] driveway [, [I] guess] , that's [what] [they] [do] [and] [then _,] I had_ [to] wheel barrow [it in] . 
A|144| A: [Yeah ,] [Right .] 
B|145| B: _But_ [, uh , you know [,] you can] improve [your] [own] soil [there] 
A|146| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|147| B: [but] [the] Texas soil isn't [the] greatest , gardening soil . 
A|148| A: [That's] _right_ [, you _, you] [have_ to] [work] [on] . You , [really] _do ._ 
B|149| B: [Right [.] And] [you know ,] _if_ [I , I] _didn't_ [wait] [five] [years] [for it] [to] _be_ [good] [enough] grow [you know] [what] [I mean] 
A|150| A: [That's] _right_ . [When] [we] [had] _our_ pool done [I had] [them] [to] leave [some] extra [loam] [, you know ,] [for [my] garden] [so [I] had] [, [I had] [a] lot of] [loam] [out there] [to] [start] [with] [I] [just] turned [it all] [up and] mixed [it all] [up] together [with] , 
B|151| B: [Uh-huh [.] Do _you have] ,_ [do [you] have a] rotor tiller ? 
A|152| A: No [. [I] don't] [, I] did _it by hand_ , 
B|153| B: Small [enough] [, [you have] _a] [,_ [just] [do] [it] by hand] ? 
A|154| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|155| B: [Yeah .] 
A|156| A: [It] wasn't [too much] [of a] job , [really] . 
B|157| B: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
A|158| A: Like [I] [say] [it's] [just] , 
B|159| B: [Yeah .] I'd [like [to] get] _one of_ these [little] [small] ones [, that] [you] [see] [in] [all] these gardening magazines . 
A|160| A: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh [._ It] _would be_ handy . 
B|161| B: [And] [it] weighs twenty [pounds] [or] , [something] [like that .] 
A|162| A: [Yeah .] 
B|163| B: [My] neighbor across [the] street has _one ._ He always uses [it] [to] dethatch his [lawn] ,

B|165| B: [I see] him [out there] , 
A|166| A: [Yeah .] 
B|167| B: [and [I] guess it] has [a] thatcher attachment [to] [it .] 
A|168| A: [It] might [be] handy , 
B|169| B: _Yeah . Yeah ._ 
A|170| A: They're pretty neat [little] , [I've] never [seen] [one .] 
B|171| B: [I have a] friend who has [one] _and , and_ he lets [me [,] you know ,] no [problem] borrowing _if_ _it's [,_ just] [a] hassle [when [you] know ,] [to] [go] [up] 
A|172| A: [Uh-huh .] [Oh , yeah .] 
B|173| B: [and] [it's] [a] fairly large [one] [to ,] heave [it up] into [the] back [of the] van , bring [it] [home] [and ,] check [it] back [and just] grab [it [,] you know ,] _if_ [I [,] just] [go] [to] [my] garage [and] grab [it .] 
A|174| A: [Yeah _.] Uh-huh_ [Right . Yeah .] _That would be_ neat [, sure] .

B|193| B: [Oh ,] [they ,] [they] [are] [the] best . 
A|194| A: [Yeah _.] We_ _tried_ [to] find [them] last [year] _, we_ screwed [around] [and] waited [too] [long] [and I] couldn't find [a] nursery [that] [had] [any] [of them] [left] . 
B|195| B: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh .] 
A|196| A: [But] we've _got some_ _this year ._

A|200| A: They're [up and] [doing] fine . 
B|201| B: [Yeah [.] I [,] uh ,] [those] [onions] [, I think [,] [we] [,] [we] planted] [like] twice [as] [much] [this year] because [, you know [,] we] [got ,] _onions and_ [they] lasted from [, you know ,] [about] [when you] harvest [them] [about] [a] month from [now] [or] [so] , [or] six weeks , from [now [,] [until] [,] until] [like] October , 
A|202| A: [Uh-huh . [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] Yeah .] 
B|203| B: [and , uh [,] we] [really] missed [them] [when] _they were_ gone , because [the] ones from [the] grocery store [just] [can't ,] compare . 
A|204| A: [Yeah [. Yeah .] That's] [kind [of] [a] ,] _let_ down .

A|208| A: [they were] [. That's] [right] _. We_ use [a lot] [, we] [sure] _do ._ 
B|209| B: _and , and_ [it was] [just] [like] everything [you] [put] [it] into tasted [so] [much] [better] . 
A|210| A: [Yeah .] [One] [nice] thing [with] [onions [and] , and] bell _peppers_ at least [you can] chop [them and] freeze [them] [if [you] have [,] you know ,] [too] [many] . 
B|211| B: [Right [.] Right [.] We] froze [a lot of] [peppers] [. We] [let] [some] turn red . 
A|212| A: [Yeah [.] Uh-huh [.] We] did [that] [too ,]
