A|0| A: _Well _,_ _what_ I_ believe _is_ one _of the_ major _uh ,_ things _that_ _is_ wrong _with_ _our_ public _school_ system _is_ _that_ , um , _we_ _do_ not _have_ enough discipline 
B|1| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|2| A: and _the_ parents _do_ not let _the_ teachers discipline _the_ children _the_ way _that_ _they_ need _to_ be disciplined right now . 
B|3| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh _._ I_ agree [with] _that ._ 
A|4| A: Uh , when [I] went _to_ _school_ _, _I_ know_ [I] _was_ scared _to_ death about being disciplined , 
B|5| B: _You_ were ? 
A|6| A: and _the_ discipline [that] my _daughter_ receives now _in_ _going to_ _school_ _is_ just totally different . 
B|7| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
A|8| A: [You] _know ,_ _you_ just , _you_ did not _see_ _, I_ did not _see_ anybody _in_ my classrooms , when [I] _was_ _going to_ _school_ , _act up_ _the_ way [that] _kids_ _do_ these days _in_ _the_ classroom . 
B|9| B: _Yeah ._ _Yeah _,_ yeah_ . From [what I] understand _, they_ [act up] _pretty_ bad 
A|10| A: [Yeah ,] that's right , that's right . 
B|11| B: What _, uh ,_ _grade_ [is] _your_ [daughter] [in] ? 
A|12| A: My , my daughter's [in] _the_ , um , fourth [grade] 
B|13| B: _Uh-huh ,_ uh-huh . 
A|14| A: and , um , there's children [in] her classroom [that] just totally disrupt _the_ classroom , where _the_ teacher cannot teach 
B|15| B: _Uh-huh ,_ uh-huh . _Yeah ._ 
A|16| A: and when [I] went _to_ _school_ [that] just wasn't put [up] [with] . 
B|17| B: _Oh ,_ no , uh-huh . They always _had_ _a_ paddle _in our school ._ 
A|18| A: [Uh-huh .] _Well [,_ they] [, they] just _don't_ _do_ [that] _any_ more . 
B|19| B: [I know] . 
A|20| A: _But_ _the_ [school] system's afraid _of_ getting sued and , um , _all_ sorts _of_ lawsuits I'm sure because _of_ things like [that .] 
B|21| B: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah _,] yeah_ . 
A|22| A: And _, I_ also believe _we_ _don't_ , even though [I] feel like [I] pay [a] _good_ share towards _the_ [school] system , [that] _the_ teachers are still underpaid and _we_ still _don't have_ enough money towards put [in] toward public [school .] 
B|23| B: _Uh-huh ,_ uh-huh . [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: And , um _, I think_ [that] _if we_ [had] enough money and paid _the_ teachers [a] little bit more , [that] maybe [that] could solve some _of_ [our] problems . 
B|25| B: _Yeah ._ Wasn't [that] [what] part [of the] lottery [is] [going _to] go for ,_ [if we] approve it ? 
A|26| A: Yes supposedly that's [what] it's suppose [to go for ,] and _you_ _know ,_ we'll just _have_ [to] wait and _see_ whether that's approved or not . 
B|27| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|28| A: [You] _know , I don't_ [know] [your] feelings toward [that [.] I] guess [we] shouldn't get into [that] but , um , and [what] else , um _, I think_ [in] some ways [that] [they] need [to] be more careful [of the] teachers [that] [they] hire . 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|30| A: [I] _have_ heard stories [, uh ,] from other parents [that] [I know] [of] , their children are [in] high [school] [that] teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs , 
B|31| B: [Uh-huh .] No . Really ? 
A|32| A: _Oh , yeah_ , 
B|33| B: Ooh . 
A|34| A: I've , I've heard some horrible , horrible stories about high , high [school] teachers 
B|35| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|36| A: and , _you_ _know ,_ [to] be , be more careful [of the] teachers [that] [we] place [in our school .] 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] _Um_ . 
A|38| A: [Um] , that's basically about _all_ [that] [I know] [that] may be wrong [with] [the] [school] system [. _I] think_ , [with] [what] [they] _have_ [to] work [with] _, I think they're doing_ [a] [pretty] _good job_ right now . 
B|39| B: [Oh [,] I] [do] too [, I think they're doing] _real_ [good job] . 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh ,] so . 
B|41| B: [But] , then [, what] [do] [I [know] , I [don't] have] [any] [kids] . No , none at [all] 
A|42| A: [Yeah ,] okay , so this [is] probably [a] [real] hard subject [for] _you_ . 
B|43| B: [Oh , yeah] 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] _Okay_ , well [, I] guess , um , [we] can discontinue [our] call now . 
B|45| B: [Okay] . 
A|46| A: It _was_ [a] joy [in] _talking_ [with] _you_ . 
B|47| B: [Well ,] it [was] [good] [talking] [to] [you] too . 
A|48| A: [Okay] , thanks . 
B|49| B: We'll [see] [you] , bye-bye .
