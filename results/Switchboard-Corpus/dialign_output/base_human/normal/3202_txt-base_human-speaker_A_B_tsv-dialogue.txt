B|1| B: _Well ,_ for _, I_ grew up _in_ _the_ deep south like south Alabama _. So_ whenever _I_ think _of_ [family] reunions _, _my_ _family_ ,_ like , got _together_ almost every week . 
A|2| A: Oh , gee . 
B|3| B: _And_ there [would] be like thirty people _. So_ people talk [about] , _you know_ , big [family] reunions _and_ _I_ think , like _I_ have [a] friend who just _went to_ , like , Wyoming _to_ some big ranch , _you know_ _, where_ like there were four hundred people for their [family reunion] . 
A|4| A: Oh [, my] . 
B|5| B: _And_ _I_ _, so_ _I_ mean , how _I_ [would] [go about] doing it _is_ _I_ [would] just call _all_ [my] relatives .

B|7| B: Because _I_ , since _I_ came _from_ [, my] father has , uh , five sisters _and_ two brothers _and my_ mother has four brothers _and_ two sisters _.
