B|57| B: So [, when] [he] died [, we] _got a_ [little] _one ._ 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: But _our_ shepherd [was] _almost_ thirteen years old [, _and] it_ [just] [, you know [,] was] _almost cruel_ because , 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh] [almost cruel] [for] [him] [to] , [to] _walk_ . 
B|61| B: [Yeah [,] he] [just] [, he] couldn't [get] [up [,] he] couldn't [walk] , _so [,_ he] [was] [a] hundred [and] twenty pounds , [so] [it was] [a] chore . 
A|62| A: Wow , yeah . 
B|63| B: So [we] said [the] next [time] [around] we'd [get] [something] [little] [that] if [something] happened _, it_ would be easier [to] carry .

B|69| B: [Um .] 
A|70| A: [so [,] [we] [had] to] [, [we] [had] to] flea bath [them] [and [it] was] [, uh , it [was] an] experience [that] [they] didn't enjoy [at] [all] .
