A|0| A: Okay . 
B|1| B: _So ,_ who's _your_ _, uh ,_ _favorite team_ ? 
A|2| A: _Who_ _do_ _you_ _think_ ? _The Dallas_ _Cowboys_ . 
B|3| B: [The Dallas] Cowgirls _, huh ._ 
A|4| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|5| B: _Well _,_ they_ _did_ _have a_ fairly decent _year_ finally _this year ._ 
A|6| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: At least _they're_ coming _around_ . 
A|8| A: _Yeah ,_ [they're] _going to_ _get_ _better_ _. _I_ mean , you know_ . 
B|9| B: _Well_ _I mean , you know _,_ I think_ _, uh ,_ _once_ Jimmy Johnson _gets his_ system established _, uh _,_ they'll_ [do] _all right_ . 
A|10| A: _Yeah ._ As _long_ _as_ Troy Aikman doesn't _get_ hurt again . That _kind of_ _killed_ them _at the end of the season_ _last year ._ 
B|11| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|12| A: [So _,] I don't_ _, I don't_ _even_ _know who_ [your] [favorite team] _is _,_ actually_ . 
B|13| B: _I'm_ _a_ Viking _fan ._ 
A|14| A: Okay _. I think I_ [did] [know] _that [,_ _I] just_ forgot . Okay . 
B|15| B: _And_ _they haven't _been_ doing_ _too_ hot _, so_ . 
A|16| A: _Yeah ._ Has Herschel Walker _done_ _much_ _for_ them ? 
B|17| B: _No_ _, in_ _fact _,_ in_ _fact_ _the Cowboys_ _got_ [the] best [end of] [that] deal . 
A|18| A: Definitely . [Well ,] _he _was_ a_ good player _. _I_ guess_ _, well _I_ don't know ,_ _he_ _just_ _never_ _, I don't know ,_ _for a_ while _there_ , 
B|19| B: _I've_ [never] _been_ over _impressed with him_ . 
A|20| A: [Well ,] _he_ could _always_ _get_ past [, you know ,] he'd _get_ past _like_ _six_ _or_ seven tackles _and_ _just_ _keep_ spinning [around] _and_ _get_ _on_ _into _the_ end_ zone . _But ,_ um _, I guess you_ [never] could _really_ _see_ [him] play , because [with] _the Cowboys ,_ while _he was_ [with] [the] _team _,_ the_ rest _of the_ [team] _was_ pretty poor [so] [you] couldn't _really_ tell if _it was_ _just_ [him] _or_ [the] [team] _and_ [I] _always_ _just_ assumed [that] _he was_ [too] good _for_ [the] rest _of the_ [team] . _But _,_ I don't know_ . 
B|21| B: [Well ,] who's [the] running , _is it_ Sammy _Smith _,_ or_ _is it ,_ _Emmett Smith_ . 
A|22| A: [Emmett [Smith] ,] yeah . 
B|23| B: [Emmett Smith] . 
A|24| A: he's [been doing] real good . [I'm] pretty [impressed with him] [so] far . 
B|25| B: [Yeah .] 
A|26| A: Did _he_ , [did] _he_ _actually_ play [in] [the] Pro Bowl _. I_ remember _he was_ _like_ [a] backup _and then_ somebody [got] injured _and he was_ supposed _to_ go . 
B|27| B: _I'm not sure_ . 
A|28| A: _Yeah , I_ _kind of_ [, I] [haven't been] keeping _up_ [with] _football_ [, [I] mean [,] in] [the] fall [I] [, I] _can_ go _on_ _and_ _on_ _about_ _football_ _, but_ _since_ it's _kind of_ off _season ,_ it's _kind of_ hard _to_ [think] back _about_ [all] [that] . _But , uh ,_ 
B|29| B: [Who] _else_ [is [,] uh _,] oh_ there's [, you know ,] Mike , Minnesota _Vikings ,_ _used _to_ be the_ general manager starting [the] World Football League . 
A|30| A: [Yeah .] 
B|31| B: [So _,] and_ [and he was] _trying to keep_ [, uh _,] uh _, I_ can't_ [even] [think] [of the] guy's name , either [, the] coach [of _the] Vikings_ . 
A|32| A: _Um , I_ [have] _no_ idea . 
B|33| B: Jerry Burns . 
A|34| A: [No] earthly idea . 
B|35| B: [he was] [going _to] keep him_ [as] [the] coach somehow _, but _,_ uh [, I_ don't know ,] _I'd_ [like] _to see_ _the Vikings_ [get] revamped somehow . 
A|36| A: How [did] [they] [end] _up_ [this year] ? Did [they] , [did] [they] _make_ [it] [to] _the play-offs_ _at_ [all] ? 
B|37| B: [Well _,] _they_ started_ _out_ [really] _bad_ _, they_ _went_ [like] _one_ [and] [six] _, and _then_ they_ won _five_ [or] [six] _in a_ row . 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|39| B: [So] _they were _in_ _a_ shot_ [to] [make] [the play-offs] _and they_ screwed [up] _the last_ couple [of] _games_ . 
A|40| A: Kind _of like the_ cowboys [, huh .] 
B|41| B: [Yeah [, I] guess you] [can] , 
A|42| A: Except [I think] [the Cowboys] _are_ _on the_ upswing [I don't know] _about_ [the Vikings] 
B|43| B: [Yeah .] 
A|44| A: Just hadn't heard _much_ _about_ them lately . 
B|45| B: _And_ _the Cardinals_ _were_ [kind [of] like the] [in] _fact_ _they were_ [doing] [better] _than [the_ _Cowboys ,] and_ [the] _Cowboy_ _, Cowboys_ came [on] strong _at the end of the season _,_ and_ _the Cardinals_ [got] [killed] by [the Cowboys _,] so_ . 
A|46| A: [Yeah .] [Well [,] [the] Cardinals] [, I don't know] _. I think_ [the Cowboys] probably [have a] , [a] [better] [team] . _They_ _just_ , [at the end of the season [,] the] [kind of] [got] messed [up] [with] Aikman getting hurt , because [, uh ,] Laufenberg _just_ couldn't _ever_ [really] [get] [it] together [at] [all] . Of _course_ , [he] sat along [the] sidelines [all] [season ,] [he] [never] [really] [got] [in a] game , [never] [did] [a] whole lot . 
B|47| B: _Oh ,_ [don't] made _any_ excuses [for] [him] 
A|48| A: [Well _,] I'm_ _just_ saying [I] shouldn't [, I] shouldn't blast [him] [like] _that ,_ _say_ [, oh] _well ,_ Laufenberg [got] [out] _there_ [and] blew [it] [for] them [, [I] mean ,] [he] didn't [get] [to see] _much_ action . _But _,_ too_ [bad] . Because _now_ , _now_ [, you know ,] [he] had [a shot] _and [,_ and] didn't look [too] good [and] [so] , _no_ one's [going to] [have] _much_ faith [in] [him] [any] _more_ . 
B|49| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|50| A: In [fact [,] I think] [they're] getting [a] different guy _for a_ backup quarterback _. I_ [haven't] [, uh , I] [haven't] kept [up] [with] [it] lately _, but I_ remember reading _something_ [a] few months _ago_ _about_ them signing somebody [else] [on] [, or] [, or] [trying to] go after somebody [or] trade [for] somebody [, but] [it] wasn't anybody [I'd] [really] heard [of] . _But_ [I] heard _on the_ radio [this] morning [, or] _yesterday_ morning , _that [,_ uh ,] Aikman's back [in] practicing , [doing] real , real _well_ . _Um ,_ _who_ [is it ,] Michael Irvin 
B|51| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|52| A: [he] said _that [,_ uh ,] Aikman [was] hitting [him] [right] _on the_ numbers every _time_ . [So ,] sounds [like] he's [going [to] be] [all right] [for] next [season] . They're _just_ [trying] [not] [to] overwork [him] [right] _now_ , until [he] [gets his] shoulder [, uh ,] back [in] _it was_ [his] shoulder , wasn't [it ,] [that] [he] had [the] problems [with] ? 
B|53| B: [I don't know] [Yeah] _I think it was_ . 
A|54| A: [I think _it] [, [I_ think] it was] [his] shoulder [he] had surgery [on] . _But_ _anyway ,_ [they're] [trying [to keep] him] [, you know ,] [keep him] [, uh ,] from reinjuring anything [, but] _anyway_ 
B|55| B: [But , uh [,] well I] [got] _my_ thirty _day notice_ [yesterday] . 
A|56| A: Thirty [day notice] [for] what ? 
B|57| B: [Um [,] I'm] [done] , _where_ [I] work . 
A|58| A: [Oh ,] [really] . 
B|59| B: [So ,] [anyway [,] _I guess] we_ _can't_ _talk_ [much] [more] _about [that_ [,] but [I] just] thought [I'd] throw [that] _in there_ 
A|60| A: _What_ . [Oh ,] okay , maybe I'll call [you] back after , after [the] recording [is] finished . Actually [I think] [we] [have] _talked_ [about] _football_ [for] [five] minutes _. [I_ can't] remember . 
B|61| B: [Oh _,] _I've_ always_ ran _out of_ [time] [ever] [since] _I've done_ [this] . 
A|62| A: Really _. I_ usually [have] _, too ._ 
B|63| B: [They] [always] [say] you've [talked] [your] _ten_ minute limit . 
A|64| A: [Yeah [,] [I've] done] [that] [once] [or] twice _. I_ didn't look [at the] clock _when_ [we] [started] talking [, so] [I guess we] should [talk] [about] _football_ _a little bit_ longer [just] [to be] _sure we_ [got] [five] minutes [in] . 
B|65| B: Make [sure we] [get] our cash flow . 
A|66| A: [Yeah .] [So] other [than [the] [Vikings] ,] _who_ [do] [you] [like] ? 
B|67| B: [Um [,] actually] _, when_ [I] [was] younger [, I] [was a] Cardinal _fan_ [, too .] 
A|68| A: Uh [, oh] . 
B|69| B: Remember Jim Hart ? Jim Hart [was] playing . Terry Metcalf [was] [on [the] Cardinals] . This [was a] [long] [time] [ago] . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| B: [Um [, I] don't [know] who] [else] [I've] [ever] . That's [about] [it , I] [was] [always] [a] Viking _fan [._ I think I] [was] [into [the] Cardinals] [for [a] little bit] [and ,] 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] Back [when] [they were in] Saint Louis ? 
B|73| B: Yes [, oh] , _of course_ . 
A|74| A: Since they've [been] [to] Phoenix [they haven't been] [, uh ,] [all] [that] impressive [, I guess] [. [I] guess] [I've always] [been] [a] [Cowboy] [fan .] Other [than] [that [,] [I] mean , you know [,] when] [I've] [, you know [,] when] [you] grow [up] [in a] city [that] has [the] [, you know ,] [one] [of the] greatest _football_ teams until [the last] few years [, you] [kind of] tend [to] [get] caught [up] [in] [it] . 
B|75| B: [Yeah [,] [well] [,] _the] Cowboys were_ America's [football] [team ,] 
A|76| A: [Yeah .] 
B|77| B: there's [no] question _about [that_ [,] so] . 
A|78| A: [Yeah , [I] mean] [it ,] [it was] [really] exciting , growing [up] [when] [, when] [the Cowboys were] [really] big . Because [my] parents would [always] [have] [season] _tickets_ [, and] they'd go [to] [all] [the] [games] [, and] [you know [,] the] hype [were] [just] unbelievable . It's [just] [, you know [,] [the] last] [, oh] [I guess] probably [since] [about] eighty-four , [about] eighty-five [was] [when] [they started] [kind of] [going] downhill [really] [, but [,] you know [,] I'm] [just] [used to] [always] growing [up] [and] hearing [Cowboys [,] [Cowboys] [,] [Cowboys] , [and] [,] you know ,] Super Bowl [, and] [all] [this] other stuff . [So [,] I can't] [, you know [,] [I'm] not] [going to] decide [I don't] [like] them [just] because [they're] having [a] few [bad] years [. [I] mean [,] I think] [they'll] pull [out of] [it [,] [and] [,] you know [,] they'll] [, they'll] wind [up] being good again . They've [got] some , lot [of] [really] good young players [that] _are_ [going _to] ,_ [that] _are_ [going _to] [,_ uh ,] [do] pretty good [, I think] . [But ,] [they're] raising prices [on] their _tickets_ . [So] [they're] banking [on] [doing] good next [season] [. I think] _tickets_ _are_ , 
B|79| B: Again . 
A|80| A: [Yeah .] 
B|81| B: [What] [are] [they] _going up_ [to ,] thirty bucks [or] [something] ? 
A|82| A: Thirty [, or] thirty-two [for] [really] good _tickets_ . See [, they] [, they] sectioned [it] [out] [even] [more] . [They] [used to] [just] [have] [like] [, uh ,] first [of] [all] [it was] [all] [one] price . [And] [then they] sectioned [it] [out] [to] [end] zone [and then] everything [else] . [And] _now_ [they're] sectioning [it] off [to] [like] from [the] , from [one] twenty yard line [to] [the] other [one] , [just] [on the] _lower_ levels [is] [the] highest price [, and then] [the] next highest price [is] [that] same area [but] above [it] [on the] upper level [, and then] [like] from [the] twenty [to] [the] [ten] yard line . [And] [then] [they're] some sections [kind of] [in] [the] corner areas [, and then] [the] cheapest [of course] [is] [going [to] be [the] end] [, the] direct [end] zones . [But ,] um [, they] [have] [about] four [or] [five] different prices _now_ , [that] [they're] structuring [it] [with] [, but] obviously yeah , [they're] [all] [going up] , [more] [or] less [is] what it's [going to] [do] . 
B|83| B: [So] [now] [the] [tickets] [even] [got] [lower] [than the] lowest [one] [last year .] 
A|84| A: [Um [,] you know [,] [I'm] not sure] [, [I'm] not] positive [, I] didn't [, I] didn't [really] [think] [about that] [. [I] just] remember [trying to] figure [out] [where] [you] could [get] [that] [was] real close [to] [the] good section [but] [in] [the] [little bit] cheaper . [But ,] [not] [that] I'll [ever] go [. I] hadn't [been] [to] [a] [Cowboys] game , [time] , [last] [time] [I] [went] [to] [the Cowboys] game [was] during [that ,] um , N F L strike [, or] [the] [, when] [they] had [the] scab [team ,] teams [in there] [, and] [it was] [the] [, uh ,] [Dallas] [and] Washington Redskins game . [And] [I] [went] because [my] dad [can] usually [get] [a] hold [of] some free [tickets] , because [a] lot [of] those doctors [have] [season] [tickets] [, [and] they] , um , if [they're] [not] [going to] use them [they'll] give them [to] somebody [else] . [So] [my] dad [, I] [went] [with] [my] dad [to] [a] game [that] [one] [time] . [But] [that] wasn't [a] real [, you know ,] [it was] , [it was] [the] scab teams , [it was] [kind of] [, you know ,] [it was] [kind of] different [, I guess] . [And] before [that] it's [been] quite [a] few years . [I've] [been] wanting [to] go [to] [a] game [, [I] just] [never] , [never] [have] gotten [around] [to] [it] . [So] maybe [this year .] 
B|85| B: That's interesting [, I] almost lost our electricity here . 
A|86| A: [Oh] .
