A|12| A: Of [course] , uh-huh . 
B|13| B: Uh _, but _,_ I think_ _a lot of_ goods are made _not_ _to_ last real [long] 
A|14| A: Right 
B|15| B: _uh ,_ 
A|16| A: right , [just] _to get_ [you] by five _years_ [and] then you'll throw [it] away rather _than_ [have] [it] _fixed_ 
B|17| B: [Yeah .] 
A|18| A: We're , we're [a] wasteful society , [for] _sure ._ 
B|19| B: _Well ,_ _that's_ true _, and_ _lot of_ times though _, it_ _is_ _, it_ costs _so_ much [to get] _something_ [fixed] _that_ [you] almost are [just] as well off buying another _one_ _you know _,_ if_ _it's_ , 
A|20| A: Right . Right [.

B|21| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|22| A: So [we] took those [back] [, and] [that's] about [that] [all] [that] were taken [back] [in] ages . 
B|23| B: _Well ,_ yeah _, I think_ _a lot of_ times _, if_ [you] [get] [a] brand name _uh , you know _,_ if_ _it's_ [a] _, a_ _good_ brand , 
A|24| A: [Yeah .] 
B|25| B: _I _,_ you_ _, I think_ there's , _there_ can _be_ [a] lemon [in] [anything] _but _,_ uh _,_ I think_ _more_ _often_ [than] _not ,_ 
A|26| A: Right . 
B|27| B: [you] _, you_ pretty well _know_ [what] you're getting ahead [of] [time] _, and , uh_ _you know _,_ if_ [you] _buy a_ _good_ _one _,_ you_ shouldn't _have any _,_ you know _,_ too_ much [of] [a] problem with [it] , 
A|28| A: Right . 
B|29| B: [I] mean , [we] , [we] had [a] car once [that] [we] tried [to] [have] declared [a] lemon under [the] lemon law _which_ _is_ extremely difficult _to do_ . 
A|30| A: Oh , _really_ . [It's] hard . 
B|31| B: [We] never could [get] [it] declared [a] lemon [, and] [the] car would go _and ,_ without _any_ warning whatsoever _, you_ could _be_ _going_ down [the] freeway _at_ sixty _and it_ would stop 
A|32| A: Oh , wow . 
B|33| B: [and] _I ,_ _there_ _was_ [just] _, you know _,_ and ,_ oh , [we] [went] round [and] round with [the] manufacturer _and [,_ and] everything [, and they] got [it] finally semifixed _, but_ _it was_ such [a] hassle 
A|34| A: [Uh-huh] [, and [it] just] pertained [to] [that] 
B|35| B: yeah , yeah [it] _, it_ [really] _is_ _, uh _,_ but ,_ gee , this _is_ , [of] [all] [the] topics [I] [have] had , I'm doing this thing , this _is_ [kind of] [the] strangest _one_ . 
A|36| A: [I _,] at_ _first_ [I] thought [of] food [, you know _,] because_ [that's] [what] , mainly [what] [I] [buy] [, it] seems [like] [, and _, uh] , you know [,_ I] still [don't [have] any ,] [anything] [to do] [there] [, but ,] But [I [, I] _think] [,_ too] [, [a] lot of] _people_ _don't buy_ their warranties [either] _because_ [they] [know] [that] [when] [it's] [that] old they're [going] [to] [buy a] new [one ,] 
B|37| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|38| A: [so] . 
B|39| B: _Well [,_ I think] [that's] true [, and] [I [,] uh ,] now [we] generally [don't [buy] a] warranty [, because] [you] [think [,] you know [,] at] least [for the] [first] [couple of years] , nothing should go wrong with [it] . 
A|40| A: _Yeah ,_ [my] [husband] [is] [really] [good] [at] fixing [things [,] too] [, so] he [usually ,] [be] able [to] fix [anything] [that's] minor [, and] _and that_ [has] saved us thousands [of] dollars [, you know ,] [from] [to] mechanic [to] [anything] [like] [that] 
B|41| B: [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] [Uh-huh .] 
A|42| A: [but [,] but [,] [it] was] interesting _to [,_ _I] don't_ [know] [if] they're making them _better_ [or] [not [,] I [,] it's] hard [to] say . Some [, I think] [they] [more] [of] their parts _plastic_ , [which] [, you know ,] _makes_ [things] break easier [, but [I] think] [the] _technology is better_ . 
B|43| B: [I think] [technology is better] , I'm , I'm [not] [sure [.] [I] think] you've got [a] [good] point with [the] [plastic] [and that] . 
A|44| A: About quality . 
B|45| B: [I don't] [think] necessarily [that] , [things] are being made [better] [uh , you know ,] 
A|46| A: Right . 
B|47| B: [I [, I] ,] everything [is] [so] automated [, uh [,] and] [things] can [be] made without [, I think] [a] human hand ever touching [it] [, you know] an awful [lot of] [things ,] 
A|48| A: _Yeah ,_ [Yeah .] 
B|49| B: [and] [I think] [that] certainly [makes] [a] difference [from] , [back] [from] [the] [time] [when] somebody _handcrafted something_ [and [,] you know ,] had [some] pride [in] [it] . 
A|50| A: Right . [Well ,] _people_ aren't willing [to] pay those prices very [often] [, so] [, you know ,] [for a] [handcrafted [something] [,] so] 
B|51| B: [Well ,] yeah , [that's] [that's] true . 
A|52| A: [so] . So [, if] [we] [get] [what] [we] [what] [we] deserve
