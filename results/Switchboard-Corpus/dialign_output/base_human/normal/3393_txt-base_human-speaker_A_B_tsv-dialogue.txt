A|2| A: Forty-eight _. That's_ _a long time _._ Uh_ . 
B|3| B: _Well _,_ no _,_ it_ wasn't forty-eight _, _it_ _was_ _,_ _it_ _was_ _,_ uh ,_ let's see _, yeah _,_ _it_ was_ forty-eight _. I_ _was_ _in the_ Air Force . 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _We_ _did_ _an_ air show out _at_ _, uh ,_ out _at_ _, uh ,_ Boone Greene _, no_ out _at_ _, uh_ _Andrews_ , 
A|6| A: [Andrews] ? 
B|7| B: _yeah ._ So what's _it_ _been_ _like_ up there ? 
A|8| A: [Well ,] _for_ [the] past _week_ _or_ two _it's_ [been] cold _and_ wet 
B|9| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|10| A: _but_ before _that ,_ _for_ most _of the_ _year _,_ it's_ [been] _hot and dry_ . 
B|11| B: _Yeah [._ _Uh] ,_ _like_ _September_ _was_ [hot and dry] , _October ._ 
A|12| A: _Um _,_ September_ _really_ [was ,] _I'm not sure_ about [October [.] _I] think_ _for_ about twelve months through [September] _the _, the_ average_ temperature _has been_ higher _than_ normal _each_ month _. Um ,_ lots _of_ ninety degree _days_ during [the] _summer_ . 
B|13| B: Really ? Huh . It [really] [has been] strange here _this [year_ _,] I mean ,_ _this_ whole course _this_ whole [year] [has been] [a] different [year] _in_ _more_ ways [than] one . 
A|14| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|15| B: But _, uh _,_ we had_ _, uh _,_ you know_ , _all_ these _, we_ _have_ _all_ these _, uh ,_ somebody said _, you know_ , you're either [a] stranger [or] [a] fool _to_ try _to_ predict Texas weather _, but_ . [Well ,] always , they were saying _it was_ going _to_ _be_ [the] hottest [summer] ever , 
A|16| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|17| B: [and] _we had_ _all_ _this_ _rain_ _, and it_ [really] is [not] [a] bad [summer] _at_ _all_ , [really] cool . But _all_ [of] [a] sudden , _in_ , _in_ _, uh ,_ _in October_ _, uh [,_ September] , [October] _it_ got real [hot and dry] [and] just stayed [that] way _for [a_ long time .] And _, uh _,_ then_ [the] end [of] [October] _it_ started _rain_ almost [a] [week] without stopping , just _pouring_ down _, you know ._ There were flash floods everywhere , [that] kind [of] deal _, _and_ then_ _uh ,_ into [of] November [, the] first , _like_ [the] second [week] _, uh _,_ you know_ [, the] first [week] actually _, we had_ _, we had_ _a freeze_ , 
A|18| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|19| B: [and] [the average] _, you know_ [, the average] _, uh ,_ first _frost_ is _like_ [the] fifteenth [of] November here 
A|20| A: _Oh_ , if [you] [had] [it] early . 
B|21| B: [but] _usually_ [it's] [not] until _later_ It's [really] strange . 
A|22| A: _Yeah _, I_ think_ [we] [usually] _have a_ [frost] [in [October] .] 
B|23| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|24| A: [Uh [,] but] [, you know _.] We_ [really] need [the] [rain] [that] we've [been] getting [, and it] [has] [not] today [, but] [the] _last_ _few_ _days_ [it's] [been] , [been] [pouring] most _of the_ day . 
B|25| B: _Is_ _it ,_ is _it ,_ is _it flooding anywhere_ ? 
A|26| A: Flooding [anywhere] [. _I] have_ [not] heard [of] [it ,] any problems [of] [it flooding anywhere] [, I mean ,] that's _occurred_ certainly [at] times [in the] past [, but] [, uh [,] no ,] I've [not] heard [of] any particular problems [this] [time .] 
B|27| B: It's just kind [of] [, uh ,] we're supposed _to_ [have a] chance _to_ get some [rain] [the] next couple [of] [days] here [, uh ,] which will _be_ [, you know] , [a] little bit _more typical_ [, uh ,] _autumn_ weather . But [really] [it's] strange [. We] haven't [really] [had] _an_ _autumn_ . It's _like_ [we] went into _winter_ 
A|28| A: Yes . 
B|29| B: [you know] [, the] poor _trees_ , said what 
A|30| A: Yes [, yeah [,] we had] [summer] lasting [long] [and then] [it [,] then] [it [,] then] [it] became [winter] [like] [, uh] today _it's ,_ today [it's] sort [of] change [to] warmer [to] sort [of] [more typical] [autumn] day . 
B|31| B: [Yeah [,] uh [,] [it's] ,] [Yeah ,] there [, you] [, you know] , [usually] there's [, uh [,] [I] [have] a] farm [a] hundred miles east [of] here [in] East Texas [, and] [you know] , _all_ these huge _trees_ just [like] [the] eastern hard wood belt _all_ [the] way up [to] Maine [, you know] [, it's] [that] same _trees_ , pines [and] [, and] hard woods [, you know] hickories [and] oaks [and] stuff , 
A|32| A: [Yeah .] 
B|33| B: [and] [, uh [,] I] [was] up there [last] weekend [, and] there _are_ _trees_ [that ,] [that] still [have] their _leaves_ _on [,_ and] they're green [, but] they're dead You [know] [, [the] , the] _freeze_ just got them . They , they weren't ready [for] [it] [at] _all_ apparently [, and] [, and] [we] haven't [had] [a] [typical] _fall_ [at] _all_ . Not much color [, you know] , changes [have] [occurred] [at] _all_ . Really weird _this year_ . [I'm not sure] what [that ,] what [that] means . 
A|34| A: [I] don't [know _.] Yeah ,_ our _leaves are_ , [are] [all] [on _,] on the_ ground now [. _I] think_ [it was] [an] especially _good_ [winter] [for] [fall] colors . 
B|35| B: So [you] [, you] [all] actually [had] some color , huh ? 
A|36| A: _Oh_ [, yeah [,] [yeah] .] 
B|37| B: It kind [of] crept [in] [and] , 
A|38| A: [Yeah [,] we] [, we] [did] , [for a] [time .] 
B|39| B: [Yeah [,] it's] [usually] beautiful up there isn't [it] ? 
A|40| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|41| B: Gorgeous [. That's] [, you know] [, I think] [you] could drive along [in] Maryland [and] look [at] [the] sweet gum _trees_ [on] [each] side [and] [the [,] and] [the] pines [and] what [not] [, and] [you] could [, you know] [, you] could _be_ driving along [in] East Texas [and] looks just [the] same . It's almost [, you know] , identical kind [of] country . 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|43| B: Beautiful . 
A|44| A: Been [that] [this year] [for] [the] [trees] [for] _the _leaves_ ._ 
B|45| B: [Yeah .] [Oh] [. [Yeah ,] I] [was] up [, I] [was] up there cutting some firewood [this] weekend , so . 
A|46| A: _Um_ . 
B|47| B: Little , little oak tree [that] [was] dead [, and] cut [it] up [and] split [it] . 
A|48| A: [Yeah ,] that's because [it [,] it] can't tolerate [a freeze] [this] early . [Is] [that] right ? 
B|49| B: [Well] . 
A|50| A: If [it] would came [later] [it] would [be] [all] right ? 
B|51| B: [Uh [,] [it] ,] there's some [trees] [like] [the] oaks , [like] [the] white oaks seem [to] [be] pretty hardy . There's , nothing bothers them . Their [leaves are] still green [, and] some [of the] other oaks . There [are] [a] [few] oaks [that] [have] lost their [leaves [.] Um ,] what [I] notice mostly is [the] red maples , [that] [the [leaves] are] just dead [, the] dogwoods still look , still look [, you know] , they got [, uh ,] bit [on the] ends [of [the] leaves] [a] little bit [, but] they still look pretty [good] . 
A|52| A: [Um] . 
B|53| B: It just depends [on [the] [,] on [the] [,] uh [,] on the] tree .
