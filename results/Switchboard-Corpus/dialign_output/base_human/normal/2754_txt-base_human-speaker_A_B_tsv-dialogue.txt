A|0| A: _Okay ._ 
B|1| B: [Okay _.] Well _,_ uh ,_ anyways _, I'm not_ exactly _sure_ _I _,_ I_ wasn't _really_ _, uh ,_ paying attention _as_ _to_ _what_ particular _, uh ,_ parts _of_ capital punishment _we're_ _supposed to_ talk _about_ _, but_ _it was_ _, uh ,_ basically what's your views _on_ _, whether_ _you_ thought _there_ _was_ certain _cases_ _that_ _should be_ used _, that_ sort _of_ thing ? 
A|2| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|3| B: Right _. And _,_ uh _, I_ don't know _,_ I've_ _, I've_ _always_ thought _that_ _any_ _, uh ,_ crime _that , uh _,_ _that_ , uh ,_ intentionally where _someone_ goes _out_ _and_ premeditatively takes _another_ _life_ _would be_ _the_ ones where _I think that_ capital punishment _would be_ necessary _to_ keep _that person_ _from_ perhaps _, uh ,_ doing _it again _,_ and even_ more _so_ _to_ _get_ _people_ _on the_ outside _who_ _are_ professionals _to_ realize _that , you know ,_ there's _a _,_ a_ _very_ steep penalty _to _,_ uh ,_ _be_ paid when that's done , 
A|4| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|5| B: _and_ _, uh_ _. _Yeah_ _,_ how_ _do you_ _feel_ _about _it_ ?_ 
A|6| A: _Uh [,_ I] believe _in_ _it _,_ too_ 
B|7| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|8| A: [I'm] Catholic [and] [we're] [not] [supposed [to] _,] but [, uh_ , I] _feel that_ _it _,_ like_ [you] [, you know _,] on the_ premeditated murders [I] [feel] _if_ you're _, you know , I mean _,_ if_ it's beyond [a] doubt [that] [you] did _it , you know_ [I] [would] _say_ _go_ ahead [and] execute [that person] [as] _well_ . 
B|9| B: _Uh-huh . Uh-huh ._ 
A|10| A: _But_ , it's [the] [cases] [, you know _,] like_ sometimes [you] _, you know , _you_ hear_ [of] _people _that_ they_ _say_ _they_ went [to] jail falsely [, you know _,] they_ [really] didn't [do] _it [._ Well _,] you know , you_ [, you] got [, you] got [that] point _well [,_ you know _,] _what_ _,_ what_ _if_ [a] mistake _is_ _made_ [and] [you] put [someone] _, you know , _to_ death_ [that] [really] didn't [do] _it ._ 
B|11| B: Right , exactly . 
A|12| A: _There's always_ [that] chance [, I don't know _,] but [,_ I] [would] _say_ [that _, you know ,] for_ [that] many _people to_ _all_ [of] _them_ agree [that] [you] did [it] [and] [it was] premeditated _, it_ [would be] kind [of] hard _for [,_ you know ,] 
B|13| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|14| A: You [know] [what] [I'm] _saying_ ? Like , 
B|15| B: Right . If [, if] [the] evidence wasn't overwhelming , right ? 
A|16| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|17| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|18| A: _So [,_ uh , [I] ,] 
B|19| B: _Well _, I_ think that_ _should be_ _likewise_ decided by [the] jury [, you know ,] because _, I don't _know , I_ think_ [a] jury [would be] _less_ likely [to] _just_ send [a] man [to death] _just_ [for ,] _any_ _reason_ , 
A|20| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|21| B: [I don't know] [a] judge _might_ [be] [a] little more cold-blooded _about [it_ .] 
A|22| A: Exactly _. Uh [,_ I'm not] [sure] [about] _Pennsylvania_ [, whether] _we have_ [it] _or_ [not] . For _some_ [reason] _I was_ thinking [that] _we_ [do] [, but] it's [, you know ,] it's [not] [very] often _. I think_ _maybe_ last _year_ [was] [the] first time _in_ _like_ eighteen years _or_ something _like _that ,_ that_ anyone anyone [from] _Pennsylvania_ _had_ _gotten_ [it .] 
B|23| B: _Yeah [,_ _I don't] think_ [we] , 
A|24| A: [I don't] , [do [you] know] [if] _Virginia_ _has_ [it ?] 
B|25| B: No , huh-uh . No [we] [don't] . 
A|26| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|27| B: [Yeah .] 
A|28| A: [I] [know] _Florida_ _has_ [it .] 
B|29| B: [Uh-huh _.] Oh _,_ yeah_ _they're_ [always] [in] [Florida] . [Florida] [and] Louisiana _, _I think_ _,_ and_ [, uh ,] _some _of_ the_ _, other_ southern states . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh [.] [Yeah] .] 
B|31| B: Course _they have_ such [a] crime problem because _they have_ such [a] unemployment rate . 
A|32| A: _Uh [,_ you know ,] 
B|33| B: Get [that] unemployment _way_ up _so_ _then_ _people [,_ you know] tend towards crime _, and_ _then they_ [they] start stiffening [the] penalties . 
A|34| A: [Yeah .] _But_ it's funny [that [, uh _,] I] mean _,_ _like_ [,_ you know _,] like I said_ [I think] last _year_ [was] [the] first time [in] _like_ eighteen years [for] _Pennsylvania_ . [I'm not] [even] [sure] [of] [that [,] but] [for] [some] [reason] [I think [that] , you know _,] [it_ was] something _like _that_ [._ And _,] it_ surprised [, and even] [Florida] [, I] [know] [they have] _it [,_ and] [you] _don't really_ _hear [about_ it] real often [, how] many [people ,] 
B|35| B: [Well ,] [in] [Florida] seems [like [,] uh ,] _two_ [or] _three_ times [a] [year] . _It's_ constantly [on the] , 
A|36| A: [Yeah _,] but [,_ you] [, you] [think [that] _,] I mean_ [if] [you] [think] [of] [how] many premeditated murders [are] committed [, you know ,] compared [to] [that] [and] [to] [how] many _people are_ being sent [, that] doesn't seem [like] [very] many . 
B|37| B: [Yeah .] No , that's _true_ . Course [they _have] a_ requirement [that , uh [,] that] every single _appeal_ must [be] permitted . 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: [So ,] [of] course , [the] , [the] attorneys , 
A|40| A: Everyone [would] [appeal] _. That's true_ _, too_ . 
B|41| B: [they] [go] [all] [the] _way_ up [to] [the] Supreme Court _, you know ._ 
A|42| A: [Uh-huh] _, uh-huh ._ 
B|43| B: _They_ almost [always] _get_ thrown right back _out_ _again [,_ but] [they have] [to] [have] every single [appeal] [made] open [to] _them ._ 
A|44| A: [Uh-huh [.] [Yeah] .] 
B|45| B: Some [of] these guys [are] [really] [, uh [,] you know ,] violent Son [of] Sam killers _and stuff_ [like [that _,] you know] ._ 
A|46| A: [Yeah _,] uh-huh ._ 
B|47| B: [I mean [,] they] , 
A|48| A: [And] [then they] _get out ._ 
B|49| B: everyone knows _they're_ _going_ [get] , [not] _going to_ [get out .] 
A|50| A: [Yeah [,] they] [get out] [in] [three] years [on] probation , 
B|51| B: [Yeah .] 
A|52| A: [and] [they] [do] [it again [,] you know .] 
B|53| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|54| A: [It's] [like] [a] slap [on the] fingers [for] [them .] 
B|55| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|56| A: [I don't] [, I don't] [, I don't] [, I think that] [it] [should _be] _,_ I mean_ [if] it's beyond [a] doubt [that] [someone] did premeditate [someone] [, a] _murder_ , [then] [I think _,] you know , _that_ they_ [should] [likewise] [, you know ,] [someone] [should] take _their_ [life] also . _But_ [, uh _,] but _,_ _are_ , are_ [you] , [would] [you] draw [the] line [there] _with_ [just] [the] premeditated _murder_ ? 
B|57| B: [I think] _so_ . 
A|58| A: [Yeah .] 
B|59| B: [Uh [,] a] lot _of the_ , [the] , [the] _other_ violent crimes [I [don't] really] [feel that] strongly [about] . Although [, you know ,] stiffer sentences [and] lessening [the] effects [of] parole , 
A|60| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|61| B: [I mean ,] these guys [are] certainly [not] _going [to_ [,] uh ,] [be [,] they] _can't_ [, I mean] _they're_ getting _into_ drugs [and] fights [and] [all] [that] _stuff_ [in] prison [. _I] don't think_ [the] parole system [is] [really] helping [that] much 
A|62| A: [Yeah .] 
B|63| B: Reduce [the] violence _in the_ prisons [. I think] that's its _only_ purpose [is] , [is] [, you know , to] reduce [, uh ,] [the] violence _in the_ prisons _so_ [people] behave themselves [a] little bit _better_ [if] [they] [think] _they're_ _going to_ [get] off early . Off earlier . 
A|64| A: [Uh-huh [.] [Yeah] .] 
B|65| B: [But] _some of_ these guys [just] [don't] care [, you know [.] And] _so [,_ uh ,] 
A|66| A: [I think] [some of] [them] [would] rather [be] [in] jail 
B|67| B: [Yeah ,] right [, uh-huh .] 
A|68| A: [Yeah .] [They] probably [have] [it] [better] [in] jail than [what] _they would_ [out] [in the] streets . 
B|69| B: Um , that's possible [I] guess . 
A|70| A: [I don't know [,] uh , _I] was just_ [going to] _say_ something [, I] forgot [what] [it was] [. Oh [,] I don't] [even] remember [what] [it was] now . 
B|71| B: Um _, so_ where [do you] _live in_ [Pennsylvania] ? 
A|72| A: _In_ Clarion [. [Well ,] I] [live in] Butler [, but] [I'm] _at_ [I'm] _at_ college . [I'm] _at_ Clarion University . 
B|73| B: [Oh _,] okay_ [. _I] don't think_ [I] [really] [know] [that .] 
A|74| A: [Yeah] 
B|75| B: Because [, uh [,] you know , that] [all] depends [, too] [, on] where [you] [are] [at] [. That's] [, uh ,] sort [of] interesting [to] [get] opinions [as] [to] where different parts _of the_ country [are] . Because [the] more grass root country [, uh ,] parts _of the_ country tend [to [,] to] support capital punishment , where [the] places [that] [are [,] you know ,] _less_ [in] contact [with] crime [you know ,] [the] , [the] more , more urban [, I mean] _less_ , 
A|76| A: [Uh-huh .] See [, yeah] [, okay] _, well ,_ see [, I'm] [, I'm] [in] kind [, I'm] [in] kind [, okay] [, uh _,] we_ [only] [have] seven thousand students [in the] entire campus . 
B|77| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|78| A: [Yeah [,] and] [that] [would be] pushing [it .] [So [,] I mean] this [is] definitely [a] college town _. Uh ,_ [we're] [about] [two] _hours_ north [of] Pittsburgh [if] [that] [would] help [you] [out] [any] _. Uh ,_ 
B|79| B: Two [hours] where ? 
A|80| A: North [of] Pittsburgh , [Pennsylvania] . 
B|81| B: [Oh [,] okay] . Near _Polk_ ? 
A|82| A: [Oh [,] I've] never heard [of] [Polk] _but ,_ 
B|83| B: [Polk] Institute . [It's] [, uh ,] _an_ old [, uh ,] university [that] turned _into_ [a] place [for] [the] mentally retarded [. Uh ,] 
A|84| A: [Oh [,] I] never heard [of] [that .] 
B|85| B: Very old [, uh ,] historical place [there] . 
A|86| A: It [might] [have a] new name . 
B|87| B: _Sharon_ , Pennsylvania's up [there] . 
A|88| A: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
B|89| B: [Yeah .] 
A|90| A: We're probably [about] [an] hour away [from] [Sharon] . 
B|91| B: [Oh [,] okay] . 
A|92| A: [Uh-huh [.] Uh [,] [so] [,] [I] ,] most [of the] _kids_ _here_ [, [I] [,] you know _,] [like_ [,] you know ,] [just] [from] dorm mates [and stuff] , they'll _say_ _that they_ [don't] believe [in] _it [,_ but] [then] after [I] [would] _say_ _my_ point [of] view , [then] they'll _say_ _, well [,_ yeah] _, you know [, you know_ .] 
B|93| B: [In] [that] case , [maybe] [, you know .] 
A|94| A: [Yeah .] You [know , I think] [people] _can be_ persuaded one [way] [or] [another] . [I've] never seriously ran [into] [someone] [, I mean] [like [,] other] than _my_ priest [, you know ,] [who] definitely says _you can't_ take [a _,] you know , _you_ can't_ take anyone's [life] [. Uh ,] anyone _that is_ [like] [so] against [it] [that] [you] couldn't persuade [them] [in] [any] instance . 
B|95| B: Right [. That's true] [. [Yeah] [,] well [,] [it] [,] [it] [, you know] , you] [get] certain circumstances where [you [hear] about] these [people that] [have] [, you know ,] stolen [kids] [and] [, you know ,] done terrible things [to] [them] [and] killed [them] [and] [, you know , that] sort [of] thing , 
A|96| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|97| B: [you] [just] [like [,] I don't] want [that person] sharing [the] Earth [with] me [, you know , I mean [,] [that] is] [just] terrible . 
A|98| A: [yeah] [Uh-huh .] 
B|99| B: [And [,] uh [,] you know [,] we] [had] [a] case [like that] [here] [and] [, on the] [other] hand [, you know ,] [people are] [saying] [that] because [the] , he knows , because [the] criminals [know] [that] [the] [, uh ,] penalties [can be] [very] severe [, they] [, uh ,] there's _less_ criminals [that] [are [,] you know ,] turning themselves [in] , [or] [, you know ,] pleading [or] whatever , because [they] [know] [that] [the] judge [, you know [,] if] [they] find [them] _guilty_ [is] [, you know ,] [has] [the] , [the] opportunity [to] sentence [them] [, you know , [for] [,] for] [the] [death] sentence . 
A|100| A: [Yeah ,] 
B|101| B: [Yeah [.] Well [,] I'm] [just] [saying] [that , [that] ,] that's [what ,] [the] , [the] client , lawyers [are] [saying] . They're [saying] [that [, you know [,] you know] ,] more [of] [my] clients [would] [have] pleaded _guilty_ [if] [they would] [have] [gotten] [a] light sentence instead [of] possibly having [to [,] [to] [,] to] [get] [a] [death] sentence because [you can't] _plea bargain_ [what] [the] sentence [is] [going to] [be] . 
A|102| A: [Uh-huh . Uh-huh [.] [Yeah] [.] That's] something [, you know] _but [, uh_ [,] whether] [they] [plea bargain] [or] [not] [, if] [they're] [guilty] [of] _murder_ , [they're] [guilty] [of] _murder_ [, you know .] 
B|103| B: Right [, uh-huh .] 
A|104| A: [So] [I don't [think] _that] they_ deserve anything [less] 
B|105| B: [Yeah ,] right . 
A|106| A: [It's] _just [,_ I don't] [, I don't know , I] [just] 
B|107| B: [Uh-huh [.] [I] was just] [saying] [that] [way] [, what] [they're] [saying] [is] [that they] [can't] [get] [people to] turn themselves [in] [then] [. And] [so [,] [we] have] [to] [go] through [a] trial [then] [to] prove [the] person's [guilty] . 
A|108| A: [Uh-huh] [, and] [that] costs money [, yeah] . 
B|109| B: [And] perhaps [we] [can] [and] perhaps [we] [can't] [and] [so] [the] guy [might] [get] off . 
A|110| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|111| B: [And [,] uh ,] although usually [the] guys [that] [are] turning themselves [in] [are , are] guys [that] [are [,] you know] [going to] [get] caught anyways [but ,] [There's always] [a] few [of] those [people that] [are [,] you know ,] lost [their] head [or] whatever . 
A|112| A: [Yeah .] 
B|113| B: Anyways [, but , uh] [. [Yeah] [,] we] [just] [had] [a] terrible case [in] [Virginia] where [some] girl disappeared [and] [, and] [the] guy [, like I said] , he [just [,] uh ,] [said] [that] he took her [, but] he won't admit [that] she died [or] whatever [, and] he won't [say] where [the] body [is] because he knows [the] penalty's [very] [you know ,] mandatory [life] sentences [for] [murder] .
