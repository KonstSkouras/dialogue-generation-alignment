A|24| A: _Yeah_ . 
B|25| B: [Yeah [,] I would] guess [so] . 
A|26| A: _Uh [,_ what] are [you] _thinking_ [about] buying ? 
B|27| B: [Uh _, I] think_ [I'd] [like] [to get] [, uh _,] B M W_ [or] if [I] [go] [the] German route _, which_ [I'm] _kind of_ leaning towards [right now [,] but] [, uh ,] [or] maybe [a [,] I] mean [, [a] , a] Acura _Legend . Uh_

B|29| B: [a] Lexus [, uh ,] [S] C [three] hundred maybe . Something on [that] order . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] [Yeah] . 
B|31| B: You [know ,] because your _B M W_ your German [cars] [have] [good] reputations _, I think_ . 
A|32| A: [Yeah _,] well [,_ I] was [, I] was actually _in , uh [,_ a] lot [of] [the] [B M W] are produced _in , uh [,_ uh ,] Stutgardt [and] [, uh ,] [and] _Munich_ 
B|33| B: Yes . 
A|34| A: [and] [I] was [, I] was there this [, uh ,] summer [and] [, uh [,] I] was [really] impressed by [the] [, uh ,] [the] [, uh ,] factory [, uh ,] tours [and] such [for] [B M W] . 
B|35| B: [The] , [Yeah ,] [they] [, their] , [they] [have] [the] whole _philosophy_ [, I] mean , [they] , [they] _kind of_ even brainwash themselves into [thinking] they're _better _,_ which_ [is] _kind of_ [hard] [to] take 
A|36| A: [Yeah] . 
B|37| B: [I] mean as you're walking through [that] [little] tour [in , uh ,] [Munich] [, it's] _kind of_ they're [trying to] brainwash [you] _, too_ 
A|38| A: [Uh ,] [Oh ,] [of] course , [of] course [they] are . They [want] [you] [to buy] [their] car . [Yeah ,] there , _it_ was , _it_ was interesting . [I] was at [, I] [, I] also went _to [,_ uh ,] [the] Porsche [and] [, uh ,] _it_ was , _it_ was amazing how [they] were completely opposed . 
B|39| B: [Oh ,] [really] ? 
A|40| A: [Yeah ,] [the] [, uh ,] [the] [B M W] [is] [really ,] oh , [like ,] oh , we [have] _all_ these [like] high tech _things_ [and] everything [is] [put] together _with_ exacting tolerances [and] , [and] _then_ [you] [go] [to] Porsche [and] [it's] [like _,] well [,_ uh ,] these [cars] are completely handmade 
B|41| B: Um . 
A|42| A: [and] _no_ two [of] them are alike [And] 
B|43| B: [Yeah] _that's_ , 
A|44| A: [so] [it's] [like] completely opposed . [I] don't [know [,] which] do [I] [like] [better [,] I think] [I] [like] [the] Porsche's [philosophy] [a] [little] bit [better ,] although _it's not_ [really] practical . 
B|45| B: [No [,] [it's] not] realistic . 
A|46| A: Unless [, it's] [, it's] _a toy_ . 
B|47| B: [Yeah ,] if [you can] [afford] [that] _kind of_ [a toy] , [then] [, I] guess [, uh] 
A|48| A: Let's face _it_ . [Yeah _,] yeah [,_ but] _it_ , _it_ [, B M W] [good] [for] [that] . [What] [kind of] [driving] _just_ [like] commuting you'd [want to] do _it_ , [use] _it_ [for] ? 
B|49| B: [Yeah [,] just] work , short trips . [No] [no] heavy mileage [. I'm] putting on less than fifteen [thousand] miles [a] year . 
A|50| A: Wow _, yeah ._ 
B|51| B: So [it's] [pretty] minimal . 
A|52| A: _That's_ cool . 
B|53| B: Lasts [a] long time . [That's] mainly [what] [I'm] looking [for] . 
A|54| A: [Yeah ,] [that's] [good] . [I] also [, I] was impressed by [, uh ,] by [the] _Mercedes [,_ too] . 
B|55| B: [Oh [, yeah] .] 
A|56| A: _I [really_ [,] _I] really_ [like] [the] _Mercedes_ . 
B|57| B: [But] , [But] if , if [you] [have] [a] problem [with] [a] [Mercedes [,] you] take [it] into [a] shop , they're going [to ,] they're going [to] hit [you] [up] [for] [just] [all] kinds [of] [things] 
A|58| A: [The] factory was nice [and] , [And] [is] [it] _different_ [for] [the] , [for] [the] [B M W] ? 
B|59| B: [Uh [, I] think] [, well ,] something on [the] order [of] [a] [three] series [, it's] probably [different] . Once [you] [get] [up] [in the] five series [and] higher , [then] [, all] your repair costs [go] [up] significantly 
A|60| A: Probably . [Right [,] I] [can] imagine [that] . 
B|61| B: So [I'm] [kind] [, yeah , I'm] [not] sure if [I really] [want] ,
