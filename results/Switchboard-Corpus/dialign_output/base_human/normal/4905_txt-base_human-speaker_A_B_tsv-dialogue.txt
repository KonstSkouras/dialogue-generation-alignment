A|0| A: Okay _Uh , I_ _just_ currently quit my _job_ _and so_ _I_ _really_ _don't_ receive _any_ _benefits_ right now 
B|1| B: _Right_ 
A|2| A: _But_ my husband _does_ _and _,_ uh _,_ I think_ _one of _the_ , uh ,_ my , first _of_ _all_ , _always_ _salary_ _and_ _the_ second _thing_ _is _,_ uh ,_ because _we have_ children _, so_ _it_ _would_ _be_ _, uh ,_ _health_ _benefits and_ medical _benefits and_ _and _,_ uh ,_ right now _we have_ _probably_ _some_ excellent _benefits_ right now . 
B|3| B: _Yeah_ , yeah . Definitely . 
A|4| A: We _have_ _with_ Aetna _and _,_ uh _,_ I_ _don't_ _know_ _if you're_ familiar _with them_ _but_ we're _real_ happy _with them ._ 
B|5| B: _Yeah . Yeah_ , I've had _a_ variety [of] different jobs [with] _a_ various types [, uh ,] _in the_ computer field _. And_ [so] I've seen _a_ variety [of] types [of] [benefits] _. Uh ,_ I've _worked_ _for_ , _for_ _for_ awhile [and] _they_ are , _you_ [know] , _a_ [really] academic type [of] place _. And_ then I've _worked_ [with] regular , _you_ [know] , industry type places _. And_ then [with] others _that_ are kind [of] half way between [and] stuff _. So_ I've seen _a_ wide range [of] both , _you_ [know] , nonsalary type [benefits and] other stuff , _you_ [know] , like [health] care _that's_ either fully _or_ partially paid [and ,] _you_ [know] , [some] [have] like bonuses [and] others [have] had lots [of] _vacation_ time [but] not much other types [of] [benefits [and] so] , yeah [, I] [would] 
A|6| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|7| B: I'd say [health] care [is] way up _there_ , especially anybody [with] kids _. Uh_ [and] _that's_ [one of the] big things _that_ [we] [always] _look_ at , _you_ [know] . When [we] , _when_ [I think] about changing jobs [is ,] _you_ [know] , _you_ [know] , what kind [of] [health] care _they_ [have] 
A|8| A: [Yeah .] 
B|9| B: [and] [does] [the] company pay _for_ [it] . You [know] , [all] _or_ partially _or_ how [does] _that_ _work_ . 
A|10| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|11| B: _And_ [, uh ,] also [, uh ,] _vacation_ time _too_ [is] _a_ , [is] _a_ big [one] _for_ me _. Uh , and_ [I] guess support _for_ whatever , whatever other , _you_ [know] , kinds [of] professional activities _you_ [have] at , _you_ [know] , _work_ . 
A|12| A: [Yeah . [Yeah] . [Yeah] .] 
B|13| B: [Uh ,] _cause_ I've been at places which offer _a lot of_ support [and] others _that_ [don't] offer [any] [and] [some] _that_ , sometimes _that's_ coincided [with] _a_ place _that_ offers _more_ _vacation_ time though , 
A|14| A: Huh . [Right] . 
B|15| B: [so] _that's_ not [so] bad , _you_ [know] . 
A|16| A: [Yeah .] 
B|17| B: You [know] , _it's_ kind [of] _a_ _give_ [and] take kind [of] [thing] [, I think] . 
A|18| A: _Uh-huh ._ 
B|19| B: [Uh , I] say _that_ [health] care [is] [probably] definitely number [one] though . _want to_ [just] , _you_ [know] , [all] your [salary] can't even begin _to_ pay _for_ what _you_ _can_ wind up losing , _you_ [know] _in_ _a_ major illness _or_ something _. _Uh_ ._ 
A|20| A: [Yeah . [Yeah] .] [Right] [. Uh , [and] [,] [and] [,] and] another _good_ [thing] [is] _with the_ [health] [benefits] [when] [they] [give] [you] [more] than _two_ choices _on_ who [to] _go_ [with] . 
B|21| B: [Yeah .] 
A|22| A: [And] [that] [really] helped us _out_ _a great_ deal [. So] _. But_ my husband [does] _get_ [vacation] _and it's_ [worked] _out_ _really good_ [for] us _too ._ 
B|23| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|24| A: [So] _But_ . 
B|25| B: [Yeah .] Flexible _hours_ are , are _pretty_ important [to] me _as_ _well_ . 
A|26| A: [Yeah .] 
B|27| B: [Uh ,] _cause_ [that] makes [a] big difference . My wife works part-time . 
A|28| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|29| B: [And] she works [, uh _,] as_ [a] assistant manager _in_ [a] fabric store . 
A|30| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|31| B: [And] [so] she works _a lot of_ evenings [and] weekends [and so] [two] days [a] week [, I] [, uh ,] manage [to] [get] home early enough [to] meet [the] kids [on] [the] bus [So] she [you] [know] , goes _in_ early those days [and] works like , [you] [know] , noon til close [. Uh [,] so] [we have] 
A|32| A: Well , [that's] _great_ [that] [you] [all] [can] [work] [that] _out ._ That's _really good_ . 
B|33| B: [Yeah] [, and] being [on] [a] , [you] [know] , rigid schedule wouldn't , _there_ wouldn't [be] anyway _to do_ [that] at [all] . 
A|34| A: [Right] . 
B|35| B: [And] [I think] [it's] kind [of] neat [to] [be] able [to] spend [the] afternoons [with the] kids occasionally [too .] 
A|36| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|37| B: [I] mean usually , [you] [know] , [you] [go] [to] [work] before they're awake _or_ _as_ they're getting , up [for] school [and] [you] [get] home [and it's] already dark unless [it's] summer time , [you] [know] _. And_ even _in_ summer time , sometimes [you] [get] home [so] late [that] there's , [you] [know] , [you] can't _do_ _anything_ [with them .] 
A|38| A: [Yeah .] 
B|39| B: [And] especially _in the_ winter . [I] mean , [you] [get] up _in the_ dark [and] come home _in the_ dark [you] [know] _. It's_ like , [it's] like [a] vampire sometimes 
A|40| A: [Yeah [.] It's] [the] same [with] my husband [cause] he's got [pretty] flexible [hours] _if_ [, as] long [as] _he_ puts [in the] [hours] _he_ needs [to do] . Worked _out_ [really] [well] [for] us [too .] 
B|41| B: [Yeah .] 
A|42| A: [Uh .] Well [is] [there] [anything] else [that] [you] [look] [for] [or] , 
B|43| B: [Uh ,] _a lot of_ [I] guess [is] . 
A|44| A: You've hit [pretty] , you've put [a lot [of] the] main points [in] . 
B|45| B: [Yeah .] [I think] [some] [of] , [is] how [the , uh ,] [you] [know] [, I] guess [it's] not [really] [a] direct benefit [but] how your [, uh ,] performance [is] rated [and] stuff like [that] at [work] . 
A|46| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|47| B: Cause I've been [, uh ,] especially [in] large corporations . You [can] [really] , [you] [know] , wind up getting , having , [you] [know] , [real] problems I've found [out .] I've [worked] [for] [a] few , [you] [know] , several thousand plus , [you] [know] , type companies _. And_ [it] [, and] especially [if you're] doing like professional [work] . Where [you] [know] , [it's] kind [of] ethereal [as] [to] what [you're] doing [you] [know] . 
A|48| A: [Yeah . [Yeah] .] 
B|49| B: If [you're] , like I've [, I] [work] [with] [, uh ,] computer systems [a lot] [. So] [it's] kind [of] hard [to] say , [you] [know] . If [you're] , [you] [know] , [a] brick layer , somebody [can] [look] [and] see , [you] [know] , [well] , yeah , [you] laid , [you] [know] , fifteen thousand bricks today [and] [they] were [all] straight [and] your building didn't fall down , [you] [know] [Yeah] , [you] did [a great] [job] [. But] [if] [you] build computer systems , like , [well] , [you] [know] , what [does] [that] computer program [really] [do] , [you] [know] . Or , especially [if] [you] write like papers , [you] [know] . Or [do] design studies [or] something . 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [It's] [real] hard [to] rate something like [that] . 
A|52| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|53| B: [It's] like [get] [a] painter , [you] [know] , [or] something , [a] artist [. It's] like [well] [you] , how [do] [you] [really] rate , [you] [know] , Michelangelo , [you] [know] How [would] [you] tell [if] [he] was , [you] [know] , [really good] [or] so-so [or] whatever 
A|54| A: [Yeah [.] And] [that] [does] make [a] [a] person [want to] stay
