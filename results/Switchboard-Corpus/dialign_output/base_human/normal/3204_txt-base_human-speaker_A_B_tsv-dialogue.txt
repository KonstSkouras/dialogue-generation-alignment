B|0| B: What _is_ _it_ _about_ , _nursing homes_ ? 
A|1| A: _well ,_ _about _nursing homes_ _,_ _and_ _,_ and_ older _people_ . 
B|2| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|3| A: _Uh , my_ husband has _a_ grandmother _that_ lives _with_ his _mother_ 
B|4| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|5| A: _and_ _they're_ _just_ _really_ _close_ here . _And_ his _mother_ has bad health _too_ _and so_ _I_ _go_ over sometimes _in the_ day _when_ _he's_ _at_ work _and _I_ ,_ um , help _with_ her _and_ bathe her _and_ feed her . 
B|6| B: _Right_ . 
A|7| A: _And , uh _,_ _and_ _I_ ,_ that's hard _to_ _be_ _a_ caretaker _I_ _really_ believe . It's _really_ _difficult_ _to_ _be_ _a_ caretaker twenty-four hours _a_ day . 
B|8| B: _Oh _,_ _it's_ very difficult_ _I know_ . 
A|9| A: _Uh ,_ _she_ has Alzheimer's _and_ does not remember _, uh ,_ _a lot_ _if_ _anything ._ 
B|10| B: _Uh-huh ._ _Uh-huh ._ 
A|11| A: _And so_ _she_ asks _the_ same questions over _and_ over again . Which [is] not _you know ,_ unrealistic . 
B|12| B: _Right_ . 
A|13| A: Um _, _and_ so_ _you just have to_ try _and_ _be_ patient _and_ answer _them_ again _or_ _just_ answer another question . 
B|14| B: _Yeah ._ 
A|15| A: _Uh _,_ I _,_ uh ,_ some nights his _mother_ calls _me_ _and_ says _can_ your family _, and_ _just_ bring _the_ kids _in the_ family _and_ _just_ come over _and _,_ and_ visit grandma _because_ _she_ gets [very] disoriented . 
B|16| B: _Yeah ,_ how old [is] [she] ? 
A|17| A: She's _ninety-two_ . 
B|18| B: [Uh , my] , _see_ [my] _father_ [is] [ninety-two] [and] still [, uh ,] _he_ [and] [mother] still _live_ [at] [the] house [and] drive [and] [and] do [the] whole thing , 
A|19| A: _Oh _, I_ think_ that's wonderful . 
B|20| B: _but_ [you know] [if] _something_ _would_ [, uh ,] whenever _something_ happens [to] one _of_ [them] _then_ [, _I] don't_ [know] what I'll do up _there ._ 
A|21| A: _Well ,_ [Uh-huh .] 
B|22| B: _I , I_ [just] [know] [that] [too] many horror stories [about nursing homes] [and so] , 
A|23| A: [Yeah .] [I] was [just] going [to] _say_ . 
B|24| B: They're [in] Missouri [and I] _could_ _, I , _I_ [know_ [,] _I] know_ stories _for_ _sure _that_ they_ _just ,_ _they_ , _they_ _just ,_ [well ,] _they_ can't take [the] proper _care_ _of_ _them ._ Most _of_ _them ._ 
A|25| A: [Yeah .] Um , 
B|26| B: [And _, uh _,] it's_ _,_ it's_ tragic [that] _, you know ,_ [when] [people] _live_ [so] long _that they_ [, uh ,] _don't_ [have] [a] [really] _don't_ [have] [a] _place to_ [go] . 
A|27| A: Yes . 
B|28| B: So , 
A|29| A: [Uh _,] I think_ [it's] wonderful these , these _places_ [that] aren't [nursing homes] necessarily [but] [they] _can_ [go] [and] reside [there] like _little_ apartments , _places_ [in] between _places_ . 
B|30| B: _Right_ . 
A|31| A: [And] [I] like [that] idea _if they_ _can_ handle [it] _themselves ._ Um , 
B|32| B: _Yeah ,_ there's one [very] [close] [to] where [my] _parents_ _are_ [but] [, uh [,] I think] [it] _would be_ nice [but] [my] dad's [the] type _he_ wouldn't want [to] spend [the] money on [anything .] 
A|33| A: [Yeah ,] yeah 
B|34| B: So [, uh [,] I] mean , [he's] _from_ [that] old depression era [and [,] uh _,] you _know ,_ it's ,_ oh _, it's_ [just] blissfull [that] [they're] both , able [to] do everything _for_ [themselves .] 
A|35| A: [Yeah .] 
B|36| B: [I] _would_ imagine [that] I'll [, uh ,] [if] _something_ happens , I'll move one _of_ [them] [or] [you know ,] [in] , [in] [with] [me] . 
A|37| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|38| B: So [, uh ,] 
A|39| A: [Yeah .] 
B|40| B: _But_ _I know [a_ lot] _of_ [people] [have] said [that] [and] _then_ _find out_ how tough _it is_ [and _,] but_ [I think] _you'd_ [have to] [really] , [they] also wanted us [to] talk [about] _you'd_ [have to] [really] check on [the] [, uh] on this _homes ._ 
A|41| A: Nursing [homes .] 
B|42| B: _But_ [I] [just] _don't_ [know] how much [you] [can] _see_ [when] [you] [go] _for_ [a] , 
A|43| A: Visit . 
B|44| B: [I think] [you just have to] drop [in] all unexpectedly [a lot] . 
A|45| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|46| B: [And so] many [people] [when] [they] put [people] [in the] nurses _home ,_ [they] never _see them ._ 
A|47| A: _They_ [don't] [go] [and] [see them .] That's right . 
B|48| B: [They] never [go] [to] [see them .] 
A|49| A: That's right . 
B|50| B: I've talked [to] many [, uh ,] owners _of_ [places] [and] _say that_ nobody even , _maybe_ , _maybe_ Christmas . 
A|51| A: You [know ,] um [, I [, I] think] [nursing homes] [are] , [are] , um , some [are] _good_ 
B|52| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|53| A: [I] [have to] [say that] . 
B|54| B: _Right_ . 
A|55| A: [But] [for] [the] most part [I] truly believe [that] [the] [parents] [would be] better _if they_ were [with] [the] children . 
B|56| B: [Oh , I] do [too] . 
A|57| A: Um , 
B|58| B: Or [if] , [if they] _could be_ real , real nearby where [they] _could_ [see them] everyday [or] _so ._ 
A|59| A: _Right ,_ right . 
B|60| B: [Uh ,] [because] _I know_ Governor Richards [is] [really] upset [about] what she's finding [in the] [nursing homes [,] uh ,] regulation [in] Texas [so] _maybe_ we'll get [it] improved . 
A|61| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|62| B: So . 
A|63| A: [I] _hope_ [so .] 
B|64| B: Anyway . 
A|65| A: You [know , it's [,] I think] [it's very difficult] [in the] first [place to] make [that] choice [to] [have] [them] [go] [there .] 
B|66| B: [Right] . [Oh [,] it's] tough _I'm sure_ . 
A|67| A: [And] [then] [if] [you] [find out] [that they] [are] not having _good_ [care] [, you know ,] [I'm [sure] that] [it is] [just [,] you know ,] [you'd] pull [them] [out] [of] [there] [so] fast . 
B|68| B: [Oh] . [Right ,] [that] [would be] devastating [I'm sure] [so .] 
A|69| A: [And , uh _,] and_ yet [if] [you] didn't feel like [you] [could be] _a good_ caretaker [I don't] [, uh , it's] [a] [very] , [very] hard _decision_ [I think] . 
B|70| B: It [is] [a] tough [decision] [and] [it's] one [that] _needs_ [a] great deal [of] thought [, and] prior probably . 
A|71| A: [Uh-huh .] [I think] that's right , 
B|72| B: [Yeah .] 
A|73| A: [and] especially [if] you're not [a] person [that] [is] like [a] medical person [maybe] [or] [something] [that] [the] person [needs] medical treatment . 
B|74| B: [Right] . 
A|75| A: Now [I know a] friend [of] mine who had [a] [father] [, uh ,] [she] brought [to] her [home [,] uh ,] [to] [live] [there] [, but] [he] needed [the] medical treatment [and] [she] had [a] [nursing] person come [in] like three times [a] week [to] , [to] help him [out] . 
B|76| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|77| A: [And] [that] might [be] [a] partial solution , [or] [something] . 
B|78| B: [Right] . 
A|79| A: [But] , um [, I] personally am [for] [the] trying [it] [at] [home] caretaker part before [I think] I'd ever , 
B|80| B: [I] [would] [hope] _we_ [could] do [that] [, and] [then] [go] _from_ [there .] 
A|81| A: [Yeah .] [Yeah .] 
B|82| B: [Well ,] anyway , 
A|83| A: [Well [,] I [, I] think] [we] kind [of] [are] along [the] same lines . 
B|84| B: We've covered [a] [little] bit [and [,] uh , it's] [good] _to hear from you_ [and ,] 
A|85| A: Good [to hear from you] . 
B|86| B: _Have [a_ good] , 
A|87| A: [Have a] lovely day . 
B|88| B: [Have [a] good]
