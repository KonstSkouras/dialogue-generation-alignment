A|18| A: It _really_ [was _,] yeah ._ 
B|19| B: _So_ _I [don't_ [know] [,] I] [, I] , it'll _be_ interesting [to] see how [the] [next] [, uh ,] few years [go] . 
A|20| A: _Yeah_ [Did] [they] [get] [the] _serious_ _problem_ [that] half _the people_ [don't] [vote .]

B|23| B: You [know ,] we [get] this lackadaisical attitude _, and_ say , huh [, you know , why] _should_ we [vote] , then [, you know _,] _it_ could_ _, uh , _it_ could_ lead [to] some [serious] things . 
A|24| A: [Yeah] . It [also] [seems] _like_ maybe another _candidate_ [that] [nobody] wants [could] slip _in_ _if_ [, you know _,] not_ _enough_ [people] _are_ [voting .] 
B|25| B: _Uh-huh _._ [Right_ [,] uh [,] yeah] , we _can_ [get] [, uh [,] yeah] _, if_ we [get] someone [in] there [like _that] ,_ then [, you know ,] [they] _could make_ [all] sorts [of] changes _that they_ _were_ [, you know ,] had [enough] pull . 
A|26| A: [Yeah [,] it's] kind [of] [like] [in] _Louisiana_ _where_ [that , uh ,] _guy_ _that's_ [like] [a] Ku Klux Klan member _something_ _got_ _elected_ . 
B|27| B: Yes . _Uh-huh ._ 
A|28| A: Kind [of] scary when [you] [think] [about] [that] . 
B|29| B: [Yeah _,] and_ [, uh ,] who's [the] _other_ [guy] , LaRouche [that , uh ,] _is_ sort [of the] [, uh ,] socialist [, not] socialist _but_ he's [so] off [the] wall [that , uh ,] he's _gone_ [in] [and] tried [to] _get into_ city elections [and] [, uh _,] but_ he's [got] , he's been put away [for] [, uh ,] credit card fraud [, I] believe .

B|31| B: [Yeah ,] Lyndon LaRouche [, that's] _it_ . 
A|32| A: [Yeah] . 
B|33| B: And [, uh [,] yeah .] 
A|34| A: [Yeah ,] [people] _will_ sit home [and] assume [, oh] _, that_ [guy] _would_ never _get elected_ . 
B|35| B: _Uh-huh ._ 
A|36| A: Next thing [you know _,] you've got_ _him ._ 
B|37| B: _Right ._ If [you don't] [go and vote] , then [, you know ,] very [good] chance _that they_ , [they] [will] _because_ _a lot [of_ [the] people] [like [that] ,] they'll strike [a] chord [in] [something] [, you know ,] [in] some [of [the] people] [, that] [so] [will] say , look [, you know ,] this guy's [got] _everything_ together . 
A|38| A: [Yeah] . 
B|39| B: You [know [,] I] [like] [what] _he_ says _, and_ he'll _be_ [so] far off [the] wall [that] they'll elect [him .] 
A|40| A: [Right [,] yeah .] 
B|41| B: And [, uh [,] I think] [that's] sort [of] [what] happened [with] [Louisiana] _because_ , _because_ , um _, the_ [guy] [did] [get elected] , correct ? 
A|42| A: [Yeah] [. [Right] .] 
B|43| B: That's [what] [I] thought . 
A|44| A: [Yeah ,] [he] sure [did] . 
B|45| B: And [, uh ,] _, but_ [you know ,] [they] _can_ always fool us [, you know] . He might _do_ [a] [good] job . 
A|46| A: [Yeah] _. [I_ think] [one] thing [that] maybe _would_ help [people] [vote] [is] [if] _the polls_ [were] either _open_ _more_ days _, or_ [you] [could] mail [it] _in _,_ or_ [something] [like] [, if] [you] _have [,_ if] [you] [have] real strict work _hours_ [, and] _you can_ only [go] [like] [at] seven [in] [the] morning _or_ after work [and] [you] _have to_ stand _in line_ [for] [so] _long_ 
B|47| B: _Oh , yeah ._ 
A|48| A: [I _think] that_ discourages [a lot of people] . 
B|49| B: What we _do_ , _usually_ , [is] [, uh ,] [vote] [, uh ,] absenteeism 
A|50| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|51| B: [and] [, uh [,] I] [know ,] _here_ [, you know [,] [you] don't] [have to] [have] any reason [, [you] can] _just_ [go and vote] 
A|52| A: [Right .] 
B|53| B: [and] [the polls] [are] [open] _, what_ [was] _it ,_ [a] couple [of] weeks _, the_ [hours] [are] [good] _and they're_ even [open] _on_ Saturdays [and] [a] couple [of] Sundays . 
A|54| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|55| B: And [so] we've [got] plenty [of] _time [to_ go] , _because_ down _here_ [in] Houston [, it's] [, uh _,] the_ _lines_ [are] [long] . 
A|56| A: [Yeah _,] I'm_ [in] Dallas [, [and] they're] [long] [here] too . 
B|57| B: _So [,_ uh _,] but , uh ,_ 
A|58| A: [Yeah , I] voted absentee [one] year _. I_ _really_ [was] going [to] [be] [gone] [. So [,] I] [did] [it [,] but [, uh ,] [it] was] nice _. I_ _would_ [be] tempted [to] [do] [it] again . 
B|59| B: _Well [,_ uh [,] I] recommend [it ,] _because_ [you] _just_ walk [right] _on_ [in [,] and] there's _usually_ [not] anybody [in line] 
A|60| A: [Right .] 
B|61| B: [and] [, uh [,] you know [,] that] vote's _just_ as [good] as [, you know _,] the_ [one] _on_ [election] day . 
A|62| A: [Yeah] _. [I_ think] [they should] change [the] whole [system] [so] [that] [it's] easier 
B|63| B: _Uh-huh [,_ yeah .] 
A|64| A: [I think] _more_ [people] _would_ [do] [it] _if it_ wasn't _such a_ hassle . 
B|65| B: Um [, yeah] , I've been involved [with] [, uh ,] some [of the] campaigns [and] [the] state conventions [of the] , [of the] Republican _party_ . And [it's] [really] interesting [to] see [the] process as far as [what] _goes_ through as far as [the] [voting] [and] [the] [, uh ,] how [the] [, uh _,] the_ [not] [the] ballots [, but , uh ,] my mind _has_ [gone] blank . I've been [all] evening How [they] develop [, uh _,] what_ [the] [candidate] stands [for] 
A|66| A: [Uh-huh ,] 
B|67| B: [you know _,] the_ views [, and] [, uh [,] you know ,] everybody gets [to] [vote] _on_ [, you know [,] well ,] [should] [he] [be] [for] this [and] _on_ [and] _on_ [and] _on_ [, and] [, uh [,] it's] [, it's] interesting . 
A|68| A: [Yeah _,] that would_ [be _.] I_ [usually] [vote .] A [lot of] times _I'll vote_ [a] straight [party] ticket [just] _because [I_ don't] take _the [time_ _to] find_ _out_ [what] every [, you know ,] [other] than [the] major candidates [, what] [they] stand [for] [on] [what] issues , 
B|69| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|70| A: [so] _I'll_ [just] trust [well [,] _the] party_ kind [of] [goes] along these [lines] [so] _I'll_ [go] ahead [and [vote] .] 
B|71| B: [Right .] There [for] [a] while [, that would] [, that] worked . We've [, uh [,] I] [know] [I] [have ,] um , [I'll] stick [to] [uh _,] to_ [the] [, you know ,] [sometimes] [I'll] stick [to] [a] certain [party] , depends [on] [the] [guy] . 
A|72| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|73| B: But [, uh [,] [if] [it] [,] uh ,] gets down between two , then [I'll] , [I'll vote] [for [the] party] [because I] [know [,] you know ,] [something] _about the_ [other] [guy] 
A|74| A: [Yeah] . 
B|75| B: [or] [, you know ,] [they're] both [just] as bad [, and] [I'll] say , _Well , I_ [know what] this [guy] stands [for] as far as [for] his [party] [, and] , um [, but] [yeah .] You [know [,] that's] [not] [the] _best_ way [but ,] 
A|76| A: _No [,_ I] guess it'd [be] [best] [if] [you] knew each person [and] [what] [they] stood [for] [and] [why] [and] [everything] . 
B|77| B: But [it] gets [to] [the] point [where] [, I] mean [, you've got] [to] [have] [the] [find] [the time] [also] [to] _read_ _about the_ [guy] [and] [, and] [be] able [to find] [the] information [about] [what] [he] stands [for] . 
A|78| A: [Right , and] try [to] determine [if] [what] [you] [read] [was] objective [or] [not] . 
B|79| B: [Right , or] [what] [you've] heard [on] T V , which [I think] [is] [just] outrageous . 
A|80| A: [Yeah] . 
B|81| B: [I] [, [I] don't] agree [with] how [the] media handles elections . 
A|82| A: [Yeah] . 
B|83| B: [I] [, you know [,] I'm] tired [of] hearing _about the polls_ [, you know [,] you know ,] this [is] how [he] stands [such] [and] [such a] day [the] way [they] break [it] [out] , 
A|84| A: [Yeah] . 
B|85| B: [it's] [just] [, it's] [just] ridiculous . 
A|86| A: [Yeah , [I think] it could] affect _the outcome_ [, you know ,] [could make] [it] unfair . 
B|87| B: [Uh-huh [,] it] [really] [could] [, and] [, uh ,] then , how , [sometimes] , how [the] media [will] blow things [out] [of] proportion [and] [will] run an issue _into_ [the] ground which [is] [good] [and] dead [, and] [they] keep dragging [it] [on] [, and] [it could] hamper [the outcome] [of] an [election] [for the] [guy] [that] [should] [have] won . 
A|88| A: [Oh , yeah .] 
B|89| B: [Yeah ,] [so] [, uh ,] 
A|90| A: [Yeah [,] _the] press_ [has] [a lot of] power . 
B|91| B: They [really] [do] [. I] [, I] [sometimes] [think that] [that] [should] [be] limited [more] . 
A|92| A: [Yeah [,] oh] [, but ,] boy [you] try [get into] [that ,] you'd [really] [open] [a] [can] [of] worms . 
B|93| B: [Oh ,] yes [, or] [they] [, I] agree [with] [the] freedom [of [the] press] [, you know [,] [and] all] [the] amendments [, but] [sometimes] [it's] [for the] public's own [good] [that] we [don't] hear things . 
A|94| A: [Yeah ,] [seems [that] [they] should] regulate themselves [a] little bit [, and [I] don't] [think] [they] ever care [to] . 
B|95| B: [No ,] [they don't] . 
A|96| A: [Well , I] can't [think] [of] anything else [really] [about the polls] [or] [voting] [, to] talk [about] . 
B|97| B: [Well , I] enjoyed _talking to you ._ 
A|98| A: [Well [,] [it] was] [good] [talking to you .] 
B|99| B: All [right .] 
A|100| A: Bye .
