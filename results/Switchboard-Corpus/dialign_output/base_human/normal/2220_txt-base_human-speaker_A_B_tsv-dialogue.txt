A|8| A: _But_ _not_ _all_ [country] _. _I_ don't_ _like that _,_ when_ _they_ start , 
B|9| B: Um . 
A|10| A: _I don't _know_ _._ I just like_ Willie Nelson _I_ guess [because] _he's_ such [a] character . 
B|11| B: _Oh ,_ uh-huh _. Yeah _,_ _I_ , [I_ like] [some of] _his_ _songs ,_ though . _They're_ _, they're not_ _so_ _, they're not_ _so_ sad [country] [all] [the] _time_ . _They're_ [just] kind [of] sweet _sometimes_ . 
A|12| A: _Yeah ._ 
B|13| B: _You know _,_ _I_ mean_ _they're not_ _the , the_ typical [country] _where_ [they're] _just _,_ you know _,_ my_ wife left _me_ _, my_ dog left _me_ _, you know_

B|23| B: _Are_ , _are you_ [, do you] _play_ [the] _piano ,_ [is] , or [you] [just like] _it_ ? 
A|24| A: Very badly . I've _got a_ [piano ,] 
B|25| B: [Yeah .] 
A|26| A: [my] mother _got a_ [piano] _and , uh ,_ vowed _that_ _someone_ _in the_ family _was_ _going to_ learn _, so_ _we_ [all] had _to_ take lessons _, _and I_ was_ [the] one _that_ did [the] least poorly _, so_ she gave [it] _to_ _me ._ _And_ _it's_ sitting here _mostly_ taking up space _, but_ [sometimes] [it] makes [you] _feel_ good _to_ _sit_ [down and] _play _it_ ._ It [is] real _relaxing ._ 
B|27| B: _Yeah ,_ [it] must _be_ fun [to] _be_ able [to] [play it] [and _,] you know ,_ _if_ _you can_ [play] tunes [that] [people] _can_ sing _along_ [to] it'd _be ,_ it'd _be_ kind [of] fun _, [I_ think] . 
A|28| A: [Yeah .] 
B|29| B: [because] _I mean , I_ [play] [the] flute [and] [not] many _things_ _you can_ [play] that'll _, you know ,_ [people] _will_ [sit] _there_ [and] sing _along_ [to] _and you_ _can't_ sing _along_ either [so] [, but] [, uh _,] [I_ like] [a] [lot [,] uh _,] [I_ like] classical [music] [just] [because] [of] _the [,_ when] _, _I_ _, I_ don't_ [play] _, [I_ like] _jazz_ [music] [but] 
A|30| A: [Oh _,] so_ [do] [I] . 
B|31| B: What's _that ?_ 
A|32| A: Forgot _about_ [that] . 
B|33| B: What's _that ?_ 
A|34| A: _I said_ [so] [do] [I , I] forgot _about_ [jazz] 
B|35| B: _Yeah [,_ [I] like] [a] [lot ,] [like] [, [I] like] [, uh ,] [is] [it] [the] New Age [music] , [like] _with_ [, uh [,] uh _,] _the_ _,_ [I don't_ know] _if_ _you've_ [heard] Neurotic Collection . 
A|36| A: Yes , we've _got_ _about_ five [of] _those_ _. _I_ love_ _them ._ 
B|37| B: _Yeah [,_ [I] love] [those] , too . _They're_ _just so_ [relaxing .] 
A|38| A: [Uh-huh .] I'd never [heard] _them_ before until [I] went _in_ [a] [music] store [and [you] know] _how_ [you] put [the] headphones on [and] listen _to it_ 
B|39| B: [Yeah .] 
A|40| A: _and _I_ [just_ [,] I] [heard] _a piece_ [and] [it] _was [just_ so] wonderful . 
B|41| B: [Yeah .] 
A|42| A: _And_ [then] _even_ [my] eleven year old boy loves [to] listen _to it ._ 
B|43| B: Isn't [that] nice [. _I] mean_ [it's] nice [when] [you] _have [a_ piece] [that ,] [that] [is] [so] [, so] peaceful , [that] _everybody_ likes _, you know ,_ 
A|44| A: [Yeah .] 
B|45| B: [and , uh ,] _it ,_ _it ,_ _it ,_ _it _,_ you know ,_ [it] _has_ _pieces that_ [are] uplifting [, but] , _it ,_ [it's] [mostly] [relaxing] [and you] [don't] , [because] [it] doesn't [have] words _, you know _,_ you_ [don't] [feel] [like] [, there's] anything [you] _have to_ remember _, you know ,_ as far as singing [a] song or something [like that] or interpreting _what_ [they] _mean_ or [, but] [, uh ,] 
A|46| A: [I mean] [you can] [just] [sit] [, you know] [those] little booklets [that] _come_ [along] [with] [it] 
B|47| B: [Yeah .] 
A|48| A: [and [you] can] [just] _see_ [the] [things] [that] [they're] trying [to] show [with] _music ._ 
B|49| B: [Yeah .] 
A|50| A: My [, my] little boy [has] gotten [so] into [it] [that] _he's_ identified [the , the] [people] [that] [have] written certain [songs _,] then_ _he_ buys [the] [pieces that] _have that_ person _. You know ,_ on _it ._ 
B|51| B: [Yeah .] [Oh [,] I] [see] _what_ _you're_ saying . 
A|52| A: Huh ? 
B|53| B: [Yeah .] 
A|54| A: [I mean [, _I] don't] even _know_ who_ did _which ones_ [, but] _he_ does . 
B|55| B: [I _, I] can't_ identify [them] either [. I just _like] [them_ [.] _I] could_ [, I] [know] [which ones] [come] next _, but [I_ don't even know] their names . Most [of them] [I don't know] their names [of] [the] song _, but [I_ , I] [can] identify [them _.] But_ [I like that] [and I like] [, uh ,] course [I , [I] like] classical [music .] 
A|56| A: [Yeah .] 
B|57| B: _And [,_ uh ,] 
A|58| A: Were [you] _in the band_ ? 
B|59| B: [I was] [in the band] _, yeah_ 
A|60| A: [So] [was] [I] . 
B|61| B: [and I was] [in] , [like] , chamber [music] groups [and] stuff [, so] _I'm_ used [to] [pieces] [and [,] and I] played classical flute [, I] didn't [play] , [play] [jazz] flute or anything [like that [,] so] [. I] [I] [can] relate [to _it] [,_ I] suppose [But] [, uh [,] and I like] _, I'm_ [like] [you] _I like the_ older stuff , too , [because] [I like] Chicago 
A|62| A: [Yeah .] 
B|63| B: [and I like] [I like] [, uh [,] uh ,] let [me] [think] [who] [, uh [,] you] [don't know] Hebert Laws [, but] Hebert Laws [a] flute player , [he's] [a] [jazz] flute player [and I like] [, uh [,] uh ,] Chuck Mangione [, do you know who] Chuck Mangione [is ?] 
A|64| A: [Yeah .] 
B|65| B: _Yeah [,_ [I] like] Chuck Mangione Trying [to think] [of] [all] [, uh ,] _oh ,_ what's _his_ name , [plays] [the] trumpet _. [Yeah_ .] 
A|66| A: [I like the] _Moody Blues ._ Did [you [like] them] ? 
B|67| B: _Yeah [,_ [I] like] [Moody Blues [.] [I] , [I] like] [mostly] [the] older groups [I think] . [Oh [,] but] [we] [do] [have] [, [I] like] _Simply Red ,_ [we] [got] _Simply Red_ [. _I] figure_ [all] our C Ds [that] _we have_ _what_ [I] really [like] _And [,_ uh [,] [I] like] Breeze [, [I] like the] group [. [I] think] [just] [because] [they] [all] sort [of] sound , [they] sound [a] [lot] [like] [uh _,] Simply Red_ . Uh . 
A|68| A: [So] [what] type [, [Simply Red] ,] I've never [heard] _of that_ . Is [it] [just] _instrumental_ ? 
B|69| B: _No_ , [it's] , [it's] [got] [people] singing [, but] [it's] [it] [is] [instrumental] _. But_ [it's] , [it's] [got] [people] singing [but] [it's] [got a] , [like] [a whole] bunch [of] [people] singing . 
A|70| A: [Yeah .] 
B|71| B: [You know ,] [how] many [people] [are] [in] [Simply Red ,] Stuart [to] [someone] _else_ [in the] [he] _can't_ hear [me [.] [I] [, I] don't] remember [how] many _people [,_ but] , [it's] , [it's] [got] men [and] women _and it's_ [not] , [it's] , [it's] nice [, [I] mean] [it's] pleasant _, you know ,_ [music .] It's [not] _where_ [it's] , [it] hurts your ears [to] hear [it _.] But_ [it's] [not] as , [it's] [not] [like] [, uh ,] Chicago _where_ [it's] [got] [that] _much_ instrument [to it [.] You know ,] [it] doesn't [have] , [like] [all] [the] brass [and] everything . 
A|72| A: [Yeah .] 
B|73| B: [Yeah .] 
A|74| A: _Well_ [my] husband [is] telling [me] [we [have] to] hit [the] road _We're_ _going to_ _go _to_ Commerce_ _and see_ [a] friend . [And _,] then_ _I'm going to_ _go to_ Sulphur Springs .

A|76| A: [Yeah ,] [where] [are _you] ?_ 
B|77| B: [We're] [in] Sherman . 
A|78| A: Okay [. So] we're [in] Garland . 
B|79| B: [Oh ,] okay . You're [going [to] Commerce] ? 
A|80| A: [Yeah] 
B|81| B: _For_ _East Texas_ or something ? 
A|82| A: [Yeah [,] yeah] . 
B|83| B: [Oh ,] okay . 
A|84| A: Just [because] [there's] [a] friend up _there _,_ not_ [because] [there's] [much] [else] 
B|85| B: [Oh ,] okay _. Well_ [they're] having [a] [lot] [of] recruiting _this_ _week_ [in] [all] [the] different areas . That's why [I [was] just] 
A|86| A: [For] colleges ? 
B|87| B: [Yeah ,] _East Texas_ [is] recruiting _for_ _, you know ,_ their fall semester 
A|88| A: _Well [,_ they're not] 
B|89| B: [and they're ,] they've _been_ doing [a] [lot] [of that] [in the] area . 
A|90| A: [They're] _not going to_ recruit [me] anymore [, I'm] through . _No more_ [for] [me .] 
B|91| B: [No more] , huh . 
A|92| A: What , [what] [do you] [do] ? 
B|93| B: [Well [,] right] [now] [I'm] [just] [a] homemaker [, but] [I'm going to] _school_ [, uh ,] [for] legal assistant [and] _that's_ [what] [I] [know [,] so] [, [and] , uh ,] [just] nothing basically 
A|94| A: [Are] [you] [going to] _go to East Texas_ [for] [that ?] 
B|95| B: [No] , no , _it ,_ no [I don't] [go to East Texas] [. I] [got a] degree _from_ T W U [, but] [I'm] really _interested in_ legal _, you know ,_ [in the] legal environment _, but [I_ don't] want [to] _be_ _a lawyer_ _so [I_ said] well [, [I] think] I'll [go] back [to] _school_ [and see] [about] being [a] legal assistant . 
A|96| A: That'd _probably_ [be] _pretty_ interesting [. [I] was] summonsed [down] [to] [the] courthouse last [week] . They had summonsed eight hundred [people ,] [about] four hundred showed up [, and] [it] [was] [for] [a] murder trial . 
B|97| B: [Oh ,] uh-huh . 
A|98| A: This guy had supposedly [, uh ,] strangled [this] woman [and] stuffed cotton toweling [down] her throat [and] up her nose Anyway , _this is_ happened [in] nineteen eighty-three . 
B|99| B: [Yeah .] 
A|100| A: [And] [they] had us fill _out_ [a] long questionnaire . We stayed till [about] one thirty [and they're] [going to] call [the] [ones] [that] [they're] [interested in] [from] [the] questionnaire two [to] three _at_ [a] [time] [and] [the] trial won't take place until June . 
B|101| B: [Yeah ,] _that's_ [how] [it] works . 
A|102| A: [And] [they] _say_ [it's] [going to] last [about] two [to] three weeks . _And this_ guy _in front of_ [me] [said] [, I can't] _believe_ [I was] summonsed [. [I] was] an investigator [and I was] tailing [the] woman _that was_ killed [. [Well] _,] then_ [I] [have a] friend _at_ [school] [that] [has] [a] boyfriend [that's] [a lawyer] [and] [he] [said] [that] [this] woman [this] socialite [in] Plano had hired four guys [to] kill her husband [and] [the] one [that's] accused [was] [the] one [that] actually did [it .] [And] she [has] since _taken off_ [with] another [lawyer] [who] had [been] [, uh ,] getting cocaine [from] [his] client [and] [then] selling [it [,] and] [he] had skipped bail [and] [they] finally extradited _him_ [and] [he's] [going to] testify _for the_ State against her [so] he'll [have] [his] sentence reduced . 
B|103| B: [And [this] is] [the] man [that was] [in front of] [you ?] 
A|104| A: [Yeah .] 
B|105| B: [Oh ,] well they'll , weed [him] [out] . 
A|106| A: The [, the] investigator [. Yeah ,] [he] , [he] [got] _off_ [right] away . 
B|107| B: [Yeah .] 
A|108| A: [And] [I] wrote [that] [down] on [my] questionnaire [that] he'd told [me] [that ,] 
B|109| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|110| A: [so [I] figure] [that] [that] [will] _make_ [me] biased [and I] won't [be] chosen . 
B|111| B: [Well [,] not] necessarily 
A|112| A: Hopefully 
B|113| B: [but] [there's] [probably] something [else] [that] might [make] [you] . Because [you] _could_ [know] [about] [, you] _could_ [know] [about] [the] crime [, but] [not] necessarily [be] [taken off] [the] jury _, you know [,_ not] [be] accepted [for the] jury . 
A|114| A: [Yeah .] [No .] *aa 
B|115| B: [I mean ,] [pretty] [much] [a] [lot] [of] [people] _would_ [know] [about] [it _,] you know [,_ [and] [,] and] [know] [some of] [the] different [things] [about] [it] [but] [, uh ,] [they] , [they] might weed [you] [out] [some] other way [. You know ,] _if_ [you] , _if_ [you] [don't] [believe] , [like] _if_ [this] [was] [a] capital crime [and [,] [and] you] [don't] _believe in_ _if_ [you] [don't] _believe in_ death penalty , _you're_ [not going to] [be] _picked_ [at] [all] [. So] [but] , 
A|116| A: [I said] [that [,] [I] could] [believe in] [it] [in] certain instances [, but I] [would] [be ,] I'd _find it_ hard [to] levy [that] against somebody . 
B|117| B: [Yeah [,] so] _, see_ , [there ,] [there] [they] [would] [have a] doubt [about] [you] , [that _,] you know ,_ 
A|118| A: [You [know] .] [Uh-huh .] 
B|119| B: [because] _if_ [that's] [what] , _if_ [that's] [what] [the] punishment [is] [in] [that ,] [in] [that] instance [, then] _you're_ always [going to] [say] _, you know [,_ not] _you're ,_ _you're_ [not going to] want [to] [have] [him] [have that] [uh ,] [that] punishment [. So] , 
A|120| A: [Yeah [.] But] [then] [when] [you're [,] when] [you're] [picked] [, see] [I was] [picked] [for] another murder trial before 
B|121| B: [Uh-huh .] 
A|122| A: [oh ,] gosh [and it's] [so] hard [because] [, you know ,] [everybody] [is] wanting [to] [go] on [and] get [the] sentence done [, and] [if] [you're] trying [to] hold [out] [, you know [,] there's] [so] [much] pressure on [you] [and] [you've] [got] [to] [come] up [with] [a] decision . 
B|123| B: [Well ,] especially [with] something [where] [you] [have to] [you] [have to] [find it] beyond [a] reasonable doubt [. You] [have to] [find] whether [they're] guilty beyond [a] reasonable doubt [and it's] [like] [, do you] really [feel] [that] sure [about] ,
