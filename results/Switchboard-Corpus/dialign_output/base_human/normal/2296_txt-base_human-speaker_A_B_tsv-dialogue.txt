A|19| A: _I mean ,_ we're within walking distance [of] , [of] stores [and] shops [so] _I do_ . Now [, [I] think] [, um ,] basically , [is] your motive simply [, um ,] health [or] _because you_ _enjoy it_ ? 
B|20| B: _Well [,_ it's] _, uh [,_ it's] _really_ both . _I'm_ certainly driven by [the] desire [to] maintain [my] weight [and] be healthy [and] be [in] shape _, _and ,_ uh [,_ and] most _of the_ time [I] [enjoy it] .

A|21| A: [Uh-huh] , right [. [I] think] pretty _much_ [you] summed _up_ [my] [, my] [, my] motivations [also] . 
B|22| B: [And] [I] often find [that] even _when _I_ don't_ feel [that] [much] _like_ exercising , _like_ I'll be _really_ tired [, and] I'll start _swimming_ [, and] I'll [, and] I'll _actually_ [get] energy _.

A|23| A: _Oh ,_ well , _that's_ [great] , _that's_ [great .] 
B|24| B: [And] [that's] _really_ [a] terrific feeling , [because you] [just] _go_ [there] _at the end of the day [,_ and] [you] figure , God _, I'm ready_ _for_ bed [and] [you] _exercise_ [and] _then_ [, it's] _sort of_ painful _for_ [a] while , 
A|25| A: [Uh-huh .] 
B|26| B: [but] by [the] time [you] [get] [done] [you] feeling _really_ terrific . 
A|27| A: [Right [.] And] [actually] [in] , [in] summer [I] [like] [to] [swim .] We [don't] [have] facilities [for] [swimming] [in] winter [, but] [, um [,] and [,] and] [that's] true , [when I go] home from [work [at] the end of the day ,] if [I go] _up_ [for] an hour [in the] pool [, I'm] [much] , [much more] awake [, I'm ready] [to] [work] [in the] garden [or] whatever [in the] evening . 
B|28| B: [Yeah ,] yeah . 
A|29| A: _So_ . 
B|30| B: [So] , [can] [I] [just] ask [you] , [are] [you] Canadian ? 
A|31| A: No [, I'm] [not] . 
B|32| B: Philadelphia ?

B|34| B: [I'm] trying [to] [because you] [have a [,] you] [have] one funny vowel [that's] _probably_ going [to] drive [the] T [I] people crazy . 
A|35| A: _Oh ,_ [really] . 
B|36| B: Say [out] , instead [of] [out] [you] _say_ [out] . Did [you _know] that_ ?

B|38| B: Huh . 
A|39| A: [And] [it's] [probably] _because [I_ [,] I [,] I] was born [in the] Chicago area [and] _grew _up in_ California_ [, and] [at] [that] point [that] was [sort [of] the] limit [but] since [then] I've been abroad [a] lot ,
